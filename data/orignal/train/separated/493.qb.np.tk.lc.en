a thousand suns
ladies and gentlemen , just a reminder
the fasten seatbelt sign is on .
please remain in your seats .
does your truck fly ?
yes !
can i take that from you ?
they &apos;re both cute on you , but i love the red dress .
i &apos;ll take that .
i know . can you believe she said that ?
i should just quit .
all right .
i can &apos;t wait to see the tour .
take those for you .
you know what ? i forgot to pack diapers .
i can &apos;t believe it .
will you relax . we &apos;ll buy some .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re going to afghanistan .
the movie stopped .
the stupid wi @-@ fi isn &apos;t working .
one lady has an allergy , now no one can get peanuts ?
this is crazy .
i can &apos;t change it .
you just have to walk down the aisle with chet .
but it &apos;s gonna be so awkward .
you don &apos;t have to talk to him .
what about john &apos;s brother ?
why can &apos;t i walk down the aisle with him ?
because .
it &apos;s so bumpy .
i just want to get off this plane .
thank you , sir .
what &apos;s going on ?
yes , seat belt on , please , everybody .
wouldn &apos;t it be crazy if we went down in a ball of flames
before my wedding ?
hey , penelope . what &apos;s up ?
is kate with you ?
yeah , right here . we &apos;re bringing you an extra @-@ foam latte .
keep it . something awful happened .
everyone &apos;s meeting at the plane .
all right , we &apos;re on our way .
all right , let &apos;s go , garcia .
trans alliance flight 420 just crashed
in a colorado field northwest of durango .
any survivors ?
152 passengers , all presumed dead .
where was it coming from ?
pittsburgh . it was going to phoenix .
so it happened in mid @-@ flight ? the plane just fell out of the sky ?
that &apos;s highly unusual . 80 % of plane crashes
happen within 3 minutes of takeoff or 8 minutes of landing .
well , an early call came into local law enforcement
from a witness who said he saw &quot; a streak of light &quot; in the sky
just before the crash .
surface @-@ to @-@ air missile .
we &apos;ve been asked to determine if there was a crime .
and if so , give the profile of the offender .
we &apos;ll be working with a joint task force .
everyone &apos;s on their way to the crash site now .
i know flying &apos;s safer , but i still wish you were driving .
safe travels . call me when you get there .
division one , what &apos;s your condition report ?
got the spot fires under control . but this is--
we &apos;re gonna need every unit available .
copy that . any survivors ?
i don &apos;t think anyone could have lived through this .
ok , division one . 3 more units en route . stand by .
&quot; if the radiance of a thousand suns
&quot; were to burst at once into the sky ,
that would be like the splendor of the mighty one . &quot;
from the hindu holy book , the bhagavad @-@ gita .
this is zone one calling tactical .
prepare to receive casualties at the alpha tent .
copy that . division 4 . go ahead .
all fires are now out in zone 3 .
we still need extra units for recovery .
sending two units your way .
this is division 2 .
we &apos;ve been asked to relocate per the ntsb .
it &apos;s uncanny , really .
colorado emergency management just turned this old armory
into a readiness center last year .
it &apos;ll save setup time .
commander reardon , these are agents hotchner and rossi
from the bau . commander reardon &apos;s from homeland security .
pleasure .
i &apos;m hearing rumors about a survivor . is that true ?
yes , the copilot frank canvers .
where is he now ?
in the hospital .
he &apos;s in bad shape , as you &apos;d expect .
i &apos;ll text morgan and jj to head there .
reid and kate can stay at the crash site .
so this has become a search and rescue mission ?
canvers survival was a fluke , a miracle , even .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll find any others .
let me fill you in on the latest .
trans alliance flight 420,
originating from pittsburgh international
at 1300 zulu ,
scheduled to arrive at phoenix sky harbor at 1710 .
the first call received about a downed aircraft was at 1608 .
the scheduled flight path doesn &apos;t
cross over this part of colorado .
no . the plane was off course by 150 miles .
did the pilots know that ?
it &apos;s unclear . regional air traffic controllers
lost communication with the plane 13 minutes before the crash .
they could have covered that distance during that time .
any sign of mechanical trouble ?
unclear again .
10 minutes after they lost communication ,
the acars data reporting system shut down or was turned off .
uneventful takeoff and flight , though , until the incident .
so as of now , everything &apos;s still on the table .
our top priority should be ruling out terrorism , though .
yes . we need the passenger manifest as soon as possible
in order to start doing background checks on everybody aboard .
where &apos;s the witness who saw the flash of light in the sky ?
in one of the back offices .
local law enforcement brought him in about 10 minutes ago .
has he been debriefed ?
no .
good . no one should talk to him but my team or commander reardon .
the plane broke up into 5 main sections .
the two wings , the aft hull and tail ,
the forward hull and cockpit , which we have here .
how large is the spread ?
about a half mile .
that means the plane broke up before impact .
have you found the digital flight data recorder yet ?
we &apos;re still searching .
it might have been driven deep into the ground after impact .
the good news is the dfdr and the cockpit voice recorder
are in a single unit , so we &apos;re only looking for one black box .
where was the copilot found ?
about 20 yards that way .
excuse me .
you &apos;ve been quiet .
sorry .
you know , a disaster of this magnitude
is really hard to wrap your mind around ,
let alone your feelings .
you don &apos;t need to worry about me .
what , are you gonna profile me now ?
it &apos;s hard to turn it off sometimes .
i guess i should just tell you this .
hotch and rossi already know .
my sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law died in 9 / 11 .
they were working at the pentagon .
so sorry .
i can imagine this must obviously bring back
a lot of painful memories .
anyway , i don &apos;t want to do that weepy agent with the tragic past ,
so you don &apos;t have to walk on eggshells around me .
my girlfriend was killed in front of me ,
and my mom has schizophrenia ,
since we &apos;re sharing .
thanks for letting me know .
after my sister died , i adopted all 10 of her kids .
i &apos;m kidding .
they had a baby girl , meg .
we took her in . actually , chris and i moved into their house .
anyway , she &apos;s 13 and the light of my life .
oh , she sounds terrific .
yeah , she is . maybe i could bring her by
so you can meet her sometime .
i would really like that .
this must have been the copilot seat .
that means the plane came from that way .
you know , it &apos;s possible the metal attaching the chair
got caught in the power lines .
it could have slowed his descent .
a series of minor bumps instead of one big crash--
it &apos;s the only way he would have survived .
what is it ?
vomit . passengers threw up before the crash .
sorry about that .
oh , great .
the hardest thing about this investigation
will be staying ahead of the media and all the stupid conspiracy theories .
let the games begin .
it was at 10 : 01 a.m.
i was standing at the kitchen sink
and i saw the flash out the window .
10 : 01 &apos;s a very precise time .
i know it was then because my favorite show
was just starting and i could hear the theme music .
what &apos;s your favorite show ?
&quot; secrets of the great wars . &quot;
so you &apos;re a history buff .
you could say that .
could you describe the flash of light you saw ?
well , there was this squiggly , smoky , green sort of trail ,
and then pow , this blinding white light .
did anyone else see what you saw ?
i have no idea . i live alone .
did you ask your neighbors ?
i don &apos;t know my neighbors .
that is the way we like it out here .
is there something you &apos;re not telling us ?
i &apos;m not sure you can be trusted .
151 people just died , mr. petosky .
don &apos;t waste our time .
i know who did it .
we leave anything out there ?
nope .
where &apos;s cole ?
he &apos;s not back yet .
if he ain &apos;t back soon , we &apos;re gonna have to go find him .
feds &apos;ll be coming . we should just hunker down .
we &apos;re so far off the grid , it &apos;s gonna take &apos; em a while .
besides , leave no man behind , right ?
mr. canvers ? frank , can you hear me ?
we &apos;re with the fbi . do you know what happened to you ?
frank , you were in a plane crash .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you see a trail of light approaching ?
there was a jolt .
severe turbulence .
it was so bad .
i said stop .
i said stop .
excuse me , we need to get him to surgery .
severe turbulence ?
i thought the weather was clear .
he said there was a jolt , though .
if not turbulence , it sounds like something hit the plane .
ok , well , other options beside a missile
would be a bird strike or a meteor .
bird strikes normally happen in lower altitudes ,
around takeoff and landing .
between a meteor and a missile ,
i &apos;d put my money on a missile .
no , i can &apos;t get through to anyone !
i &apos;ve called the airline and it just keeps going to a recording .
i have to go . i &apos;ll call you when i get there , ok ?
come on !
this rural area just north of durango , colorado ...
he knows who did it , but he won &apos;t tell us .
the guy &apos;s a whackadoodle .
well , unfortunately we can &apos;t dismiss him yet .
the fact is , no one else has come
forward with a similar statement .
that &apos;s because the population is so sparse out here .
we should be grateful for that .
you &apos;re right .
can you get him to talk ?
i can try . but i should probably do it alone .
i think he has a problem with you .
my race or my gender ?
probably both .
wonderful .
as long as you can get some answers , be my guest .
mr. petosky , i &apos;m starting to lose my patience .
one more question .
edgewood arsenal .
what happened there ?
from 1955 to 1975 the u.s. military
conducted research into psycho @-@ chemical agents
by testing them on human subjects .
you pass .
the other one , she can &apos;t be trusted .
because she &apos;s military .
the military brought down that plane .
just like united 93 and twa 800 .
probably that missing malaysia air jet .
thank you for your time , sir .
wait .
i &apos;m not making this up .
i &apos;ve seen covert military types roaming the woods .
watch your back , agent hotchner .
you &apos;re not all playing on the same team .
if a manpad , a shoulder launched
surface @-@ to @-@ air missile were used ,
we &apos;re looking at a target acquisition range of 6 miles .
factor that into the plane &apos;s forward momentum as it &apos;s coming down
and we &apos;re left with this area right here .
manpads are cheap and plentiful on the black market .
you can get one for a few hundred bucks .
i thought only planes closer to the ground were vulnerable .
true . most heat @-@ seeking missiles
have a maximum range of 20,000 feet .
large systems like the buk which took down malaysia air 17
are hard to get and require expertise .
you know , it &apos;s possible the plane was brought down to 20,000 feet
to get it into manpad target range .
that would mean a hijacker was on board .
that could account for the missing 13 minutes of communication .
if there were a hijacker ,
he had at least one partner on the ground .
guess who drew the short straw .
depends on if you believe suicide
is the gateway to paradise or not .
has anyone been red @-@ flagged on the passenger manifest ?
not yet .
if a terrorist cell is responsible , this is just the beginning .
i &apos;m sorry . i have no information for you .
please , please , everyone please listen to me .
if you go to the family area ,
someone will be in shortly to help you .
my name &apos;s shelley hicks . my husband was on that plane .
please ! we need you all to go to the family room .
someone will be there to help you . please , listen .
i promise . trust what i &apos;m saying .
agent reid said passengers vomited before the crash ,
which would confirm the severe turbulence the copilot described .
well , that specific type of movement-- porpoising--
tends to cause vomiting .
porpoising--isn &apos;t it going up and down on a wave
or like a roller coaster ?
yes , as opposed to side @-@ to @-@ side movement .
and what would cause porpoising ?
being caught in the jetstream of another plane ,
but there was no other flight nearby .
is there something else , something mechanical , perhaps ?
a deployment of the slats mid @-@ air .
you mean the flaps .
the flaps are on the back of the wing .
the slats are similar , but they &apos;re on the leading edge .
they &apos;re used during takeoff .
it &apos;s very rare that they would deploy mid @-@ flight .
there &apos;s lots of safeguards against it .
please ! his name is frank canvers .
somebody has to know something .
excuse me . are you related to frank canvers ?
i &apos;m his wife . he was copilot on the flight .
ma &apos;am , your husband is alive .
he &apos;s in surgery right now .
oh , thank god .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
come with me , ok ? i &apos;ll have someone take you to the hospital .
ok . thank you .
thank you .
commander reardon says the president wants more proof
of a terrorist cell before he approves broader actions .
go ahead , garcia .
ok , going off of braniac &apos;s target acquisition range ,
i tried to identify all the residents in the area ,
which is no easy feat , btw ,
considering most of them are doomsday preppers
and don &apos;t want to be found at all .
anyway , i did background checks on everyone .
i have two sort of interesting possibilities .
one is jesse bronwen .
he made several donations last year to a denver mosque .
the other is david marshak .
he is a former army missile operator
who was dishonorably discharged two years ago for misconduct .
and of course , i just sent you the coordinates .
all right , thanks .
why don &apos;t you and morgan talk to marshak .
jj and i will talk to bronwen .
will do .
roughly two thirds into the flight ...
i say we let cole take care of himself .
he &apos;s a big boy . he can handle things .
shut up and get in the truck .
forgot the lights .
there &apos;s no need to draw attention .
get the gate .
don &apos;t move !
hands up !
let me see your hands .
right there . right there .
fbi !
show us your hands and get out of the vehicle !
listen , i can assure you that you &apos;re in serious trouble already .
so anything you want to offer us up right now
might just buy you some leniency .
i have nothing to say .
when you were in the army ,
you posted on your website &quot; apocalypse forever . &quot;
you claimed that you and your brother cole
had the skills to shoot down a plane and start world war iii .
is that what you were trying to do ?
where the hell is cole ?
lawyer .
we just found a crate of soviet @-@ era missiles
hidden in marshak &apos;s cellar .
they &apos;re pretty old . not the kind that would bring down a plane .
i don &apos;t think marshak and his guys
have the smarts to pull this off .
and if they did do it , they &apos;d want to brag about it .
what about the missing brother ?
do you think cole could have done this alone ?
or with some other group of disgruntled friends .
till we find him , he &apos;s the wild card .
we finished sergeant bronwen &apos;s house .
no sign of any missiles .
he &apos;s a recent convert to islam , but he &apos;s not an extremist .
what &apos;s spence doing ?
guys , these are the construction blueprints for the airplane .
i compared it to the way the plane broke apart ,
and i think i may have found something interesting .
the hull of an airplane
is really just a bunch of round barrels riveted together .
the wing , however , is a masterpiece .
it &apos;s the most physically complicated component of an airplane .
nearly 200 feet long , it bears the weight of the entire aircraft
and is shaped precisely to fit within a hundredth of an inch .
the curvature of the wing is what gives it its lift .
air rushes faster over the top , creating a vacuum ,
which sucks the wing upward and in turn the entire fuselage .
this is important because an airplane wants to be nose @-@ up .
it creates positive gs , that sensation you get
when you &apos;re forced to the back of your seat .
negative gs , on the other hand ,
are an entirely different matter .
when the nose of a plane begins pitching downward ,
you get negative gs , which puts enormous pressure
on the structural integrity of the aircraft .
with enough negative gs ,
the wings will start to rip off the plane ,
which then compromises the fuselage .
the plane broke into major pieces
along structural joints and attachment points .
there &apos;s no evidence of gaping holes
or pieces of the fuselage torn in areas without seams
to suggest impact with an external object like a missile .
so the fact is , the way the plane broke apart ,
i think the crash was caused by something internal .
so are we talking about some sort of explosive decompression ,
like on twa flight 800 ?
a massive explosion would have resulted
in pieces of fuselage the size of a carry @-@ on .
that rules out a hijacker with a bomb as well .
wait a minute . a hijacker would certainly explain
the 13 minutes of lost communication .
maybe he drove the plane into the ground .
or the passengers did .
this could be the start of another 9 / 11 .
if that were the case , i &apos;d suspect a faster cascade of events .
still , we can &apos;t rule it out .
the reality is , there are at least 50 reasons for lost communication .
such as ?
as stuck mike , an air traffic controller
sending the wrong frequency to an aircraft .
the average amount of time for lost
communication is 7.1 / 2 minutes .
we have to remember the transponder was still working .
no secret code to indicate a hijacking
or any other emergency was sent .
let &apos;s think about this .
the acars data recording system was turned off .
and that would have to come from someone
in control of the flight systems .
so something happened in the cockpit .
that makes it the pilot and / or the copilot
the most likely candidates .
their background checks came back clear .
what about suicide ?
you mentioned a slats deployment mid @-@ air .
you said it was very rare . but if it did happen ,
how would it happen ?
pilot error
or intention .
are you remembering more about
what happened before the crash ?
i , uh ...
it &apos;s too foggy .
yes , he did take a medical leave of absence
two years ago , but he was cleared to fly again .
what was the reason ?
he ...
had some problems with depression ,
but he was treated with fluoxetine .
you don &apos;t actually think he caused this crash , do you ?
ma &apos;am , we have to consider all possibilities .
he passed all his physical and mental health evaluations .
is he still taking fluoxetine ?
he ... he stopped 4 months ago .
but he &apos;s been fine .
how have you been feeling the last few weeks ?
fine .
normal .
were you depressed at all ?
no .
i &apos;ve been good .
he would never do something like this .
i do know that gerry-- captain valmeyer--
rented out a room in his house last year
to a grad student from indonesia .
the guy was weird .
always asking frank and gerry about airplanes .
earlier you said there was turbulence .
then you said &quot; stop . &quot; who were you talking to ?
uh , gerry .
the pilot .
were you telling him to stop doing something ?
yes , i ...
we were arguing ...
about something .
did he deploy the slats ?
i &apos;m not sure .
do you remember turning off the acars system ?
frank , did you turn off the acars system ?
yes .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t remember .
ok , we &apos;ll look into it . thanks , jj .
if the pilot or copilot was working with the terrorists ,
that would explain the argument in the cockpit .
now , the copilot admits he shut down the acars ,
but the grad student was living with the pilot ,
so maybe they were all in on it .
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask , how you holding up ?
i &apos;m ok . it &apos;s never going to be easy ,
but i &apos;m managing .
we just picked up cole marshak .
he was out squirrel hunting .
didn &apos;t even know his brother had been arrested .
seems marshak and his clan ,
they &apos;re engagers , not instigators .
they &apos;d join a war but not start it .
precisely .
and by the way ,
we finished going through the passenger manifest .
no one has been red @-@ flagged for terrorist connections .
so we &apos;re back to the pilot or copilot .
they just found the black box .
what did you do to the autopilot ?
nothing .
you must have hit it . it &apos;s off now .
no . i can &apos;t set a new altitude .
are you messing with me ?
calm down .
don &apos;t tell me to calm down .
what the hell ? why did you deploy the slats ?
it just happened .
what are you doing with the yoke ? just stop it !
i &apos;m trying to keep her steady .
ok , this is ridiculous .
something &apos;s buggy in the system .
let &apos;s reset it all . shut everything down .
so they shut down acars just to reset the flight system .
sounds like there was a catastrophic system failure .
so that &apos;s what the argument was about .
we just reviewed the flight data recorder .
the plane porpoised on and off for
the last 3 minutes it was airborne .
but there was no indication of system or mechanical malfunction .
everything was working normally .
including the autopilot ?
&apos;cause it sounded like they couldn &apos;t override it .
there &apos;s one theory we haven &apos;t considered .
someone other than the pilot or the copilot
was controlling the plane .
it appears there is one survivor ,
possibly the copilot who ...
ok , let me get this straight .
the way the plane broke up proves there was no missile .
the crash was caused by something internal .
but the pilot and copilot have been cleared ,
so that means someone from the ground
hacked into the plane &apos;s computers ?
it makes sense with the data from the black box .
guys , that &apos;s a bit of a reach .
boeing has expressed concerns about in @-@ flight
entertainment systems and usb connections
that could give hackers access to a plane &apos;s computer .
hack in the box , amsterdam , april 2013 .
a security consultant from germany
demonstrated how an airliner could be hacked
using a smartphone app that he developed .
that test was only on pilot training software .
there &apos;s no proof it could happen in real life .
and we all know how forthcoming the faa would be
if something like that could really happen .
so , what , this unsub just blew the plane by remote control ?
we &apos;ve seen it before with a helicopter .
how do we know it wasn &apos;t a crew member or a passenger .
we know for sure that no one else was in the cockpit .
and it would be hard to fly by remote control
in a cabin for 13 minutes and remain unseen .
not to say that the unsub isn &apos;t
connected to someone on the flight .
who would do something like this ?
a mass annihilator , someone who enjoys playing god
or some other deity .
we &apos;re no longer looking for a terrorist .
we &apos;re looking for a serial killer
who wants to eradicate life on a large scale .
and he &apos;s not going to want to stop with this plane .
we need to advise the president
to ground all flights immediately .
this is knbs 27 , and we &apos;re here at the crash site .
obviously you can see ...
it &apos;s been almost 24 hours since the crash .
a suspicion of foul play surrounding flight 420 continues ...
talk of a possible missile strike ,
although nothing has been confirmed .
there has been no official statement
from the surviving copilot or his family .
all flights are now grounded
until further notice from the faa .
we got there now live .
all right , we need to play up the possibility of equipment failure
so we don &apos;t drive this unsub underground .
i &apos;ll let the press liaison know .
believe it or not , the copilot frank canvers
started receiving death threats .
what &apos;s the nature of the threats ?
angry emails and voicemails . hang @-@ up calls .
people are upset that he survived
while everyone else perished .
it sounds like the impulsive response
of some grieving family members .
still , we need to look into these threats
and then beef up security for canvers and his family .
we &apos;ll have someone on them 24 @-@ 7 .
we should also go through the passenger manifest again .
agreed .
why ? i thought everyone was cleared .
the unsub didn &apos;t choose this flight randomly .
we want to go live now to melissa who &apos;s in durango
following late @-@ breaking events in this crash .
yes , thank you , david . here &apos;s the latest update .
the only survivor of flight 420,
copilot frank canvers ,
remains hospitalized at this time .
doctors have now upgraded his condition to stable .
many people have been calling it a miracle .
thank you , melissa . we &apos;ll be getting
back to you throughout the day
to see if there are any updates on his condition .
we want to go back live to the crash scene .
we have updated footage of that disaster .
what have you got , garcia ?
ok , guess what . i borrowed a page from the nsa playbook
and i ran everyone on that plane &apos;s text and emails
from the past week against icky keywords ,
late hate and death and suicide , and here &apos;s what i found .
there &apos;s a passenger in seat 29 @-@ d
by the name of kristina morrow
received a text message 3 days prior to the flight that said ,
&quot; i am become death , the destroyer of worlds . &quot;
oppenheimer .
where did that text come from ?
from a pre @-@ paid throwaway cell phone
in los alamos , new mexico .
that was 3 days ago . this guy could be anywhere .
do you have any idea who sent that text , garcia ?
no . this kristina seemed super normal .
she was an icu nurse ,
married to an insurance salesman , 3 kids .
i will keep digging .
all right , thanks .
we got a problem .
all planes over u.s. airspace right now
have responded to the order to land ,
except one .
which one ?
interlantic air flight number 61 .
it left san diego at 1405 zulu ,
it &apos;s scheduled to land in washington d.c. at 1915 .
there &apos;s 301 passengers on board .
there &apos;s been no communication from them ?
not since the order to ground all flights was made .
how long have they been out of touch ?
11 minutes .
we have the latest from ashley at the scene .
if you look behind me here , you can see
that the fire department , the sheriff , the police ...
the media &apos;s talking more about equipment failure now .
good to know some things go according to plan .
hopefully the unsub will poke his head up .
hey , baby girl , what do you got ?
kristina morrow went on a blind date
with an aerospace engineer 8 years ago .
you &apos;re gonna ask me how i know that ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell you it &apos;s because she posted
about the world &apos;s worst blind date on facebook .
who is this guy ?
his name &apos;s hayman vasher ,
and shortly after this wildly unromantic and awkward dinner ,
he quit his job and dropped out of society ,
like completely .
the way ted kaczynski did ?
oh , call them twins .
both math geniuses , social outcasts ,
anarchist views .
however , vasher not anti @-@ technology .
when he was still online , he posted a lot
about his affinity for oppenheimer .
now the quote makes complete sense .
if he admires oppenheimer ,
then he wants to destroy the masses in the same way .
this is his version of the atomic bomb .
wait a minute . all of this was just to
get back at a girl who rejected him ?
doubtful . she was probably the trigger
that made him drop out of society ,
but i &apos;m guessing if he was solely focused on her ,
he would have struck sooner .
did i say affinity for oppenheimer ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m finding out more things .
i &apos;m gonna take that back and call it full @-@ blown obsession .
he analyzed how oppenheimer
went from being a socially awkward scientist
to a revered and powerful man
through intellectual achievement .
vasher wants to transform the same way ,
so for the last 8 years
he &apos;s probably been working on his hacking software .
he just perfected it and needed a test case .
so why not use kristina &apos;s flight .
she posted a lot about her trip on social media .
she was going to a sorority reunion in phoenix .
i &apos;m guessing he crashed the plane here
because it was in range to hack into
the flight system and take control .
and he wanted it to crash nearby so he could witness it .
it &apos;s sparsely populated here .
if something did go wrong with the test ,
less attention is drawn .
but if this is his trinity site ,
where &apos;s his hiroshima ?
we &apos;ve got a problem with the radio .
all i &apos;m getting is static .
we entered a new air traffic region .
they probably sent us the wrong frequency .
running through other channels now .
all flights ordered to land at nearest airfield .
disable autopilot and maintain manual control .
repeat : disable autopilot and maintain manual control .
albuquerque center this is ia61 , over .
all flights have been confirmed except ia61 .
ia61 , come in .
albuquerque center , this is ia61 , over .
still no response . does anyone have them on radar ?
albuquerque center , this is ia61 , over .
i &apos;m going to try center on guard .
121.5 .
this is ia61 , over .
we have ia61 on radar
entering the artcc two minutes ago .
all systems seem to be functional .
ia61 , if you read ,
squawk 0 @-@ 3 @-@ 6 @-@ 5 .
the transponder code won &apos;t change .
hold on .
it looks like the acars system just went down on ia61 .
we &apos;re gonna land in flagstaff . go direct now .
i &apos;m trying to . nothing &apos;s working .
i don &apos;t get it . the autopilot &apos;s off .
something &apos;s overriding our commands .
the landing gear &apos;s deploying .
no luck with david marshak and his crew .
they claim they never heard of hayman vasher
or anyone fitting his description .
we may have to go door to door .
i know it looks empty ,
but 28 square miles is a lot of ground to cover .
there &apos;s also an extensive cave system in this region .
you know , we talked about this crash being a test .
now , assuming he wanted total destruction ,
you could say he failed .
the copilot survived .
exactly .
it probably wounded vasher &apos;s ego .
the unexpected thing that &apos;ll make him break protocol .
so it &apos;s possible he made contact with the copilot .
maybe a death threat ?
do we have a rundown yet of all the emails and phone calls
made to the copilot and his family ?
garcia was looking into it .
i &apos;ve just spoken to the president .
based on your profile , we &apos;re concerned the next crash
will be in a populated area , and the president agrees .
he &apos;s just given the order to scramble f @-@ 16s .
if we have to , we will shoot this plane down .
if the unsub wants to witness this plane crash ,
there &apos;s not a lot of time left .
it just entered colorado airspace .
that only leaves about 10 more minutes
if he wants to crash it into the same area .
witnessing it may not now be as
important as making a larger statement .
what &apos;s the nearest high @-@ profile target ?
well ...
there &apos;s montezuma speedway ,
glenwood water park --
oh , god . there &apos;s a big football game
going on right now at lewison college .
and there &apos;s a great view of the stadium from tower hill .
start evacuating it now .
go ahead , garcia .
before anyone ask , of course i tried
to hack into ia61 &apos;s flight system
and i can &apos;t get in .
it &apos;s like vasher built his own electronic fortress .
the only way it &apos;s gonna work is if
someone physically destroys his system .
have you looked at everyone
who &apos;s made contact with the copilot ?
yeah , and they &apos;re all friends and
family of passengers except for two .
one is a known conspiracy theorist from oregon .
the other is from colorado .
it &apos;s a hang @-@ up call to his hospital room .
let me guess -- it &apos;s from a prepaid cell phone ?
yep . but i just got the coordinates
the call originated from and i &apos;m sending them to you now .
dave , you , reid , and jj head to tower hill .
the rest of us will go to the coordinates .
this is red hawk 5 .
we are 80 miles east of target and closing .
we &apos;ve just received word that
all flights in the u.s. have been grounded
until further notice by the faa .
is anyone else , uh , seeing this ?
you need to buckle up . please buckle up .
ladies and gentlemen ,
we are experiencing some turbulence .
excuse me .
please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts .
it &apos;s all right . everybody just please ...
excuse me --
ok .
this is red hawk 5 . i have visual confirmation .
agent hotchner , ia61 just changed course .
it &apos;s back on a direct heading to d.c.
he must have radar tracking .
he knows the fighter jets are closing in .
well , it doesn &apos;t get more high profile
than the nation &apos;s capital .
so washington is his hiroshima .
it makes sense in a twisted way .
how long till he gets there ?
assuming the last known airspeed , about two hours .
he can &apos;t possibly think we &apos;d let the plane get there .
no , but there &apos;s a lot of communities and targets in between .
the hard question is when to shoot that plane down .
this is red hawk 5 . i am locked on target .
i repeat , locked on target .
fbi !
hayman vasher , hands where i can see them !
i don &apos;t think so .
put it down .
why should i ?
if you want glory , you &apos;ve already got some .
stay back or i &apos;ll blow the plane up .
you &apos;ve proven your point .
you &apos;ve already destroyed the plane kristina was on .
there &apos;s no need to kill hundreds more .
you think this is about kristina ?
she &apos;s nothing .
she &apos;s less than a speck of dirt .
what do you want ?
call off the fighter jets .
if we don &apos;t ?
stand by for my command .
if they drop below 10,000 feet , get ready to fire .
roger that .
look , there &apos;s no point to this .
in the end , oppenheimer regretted what he &apos;d done .
call them off and i &apos;ll let the plane land .
understood .
red hawk 5 , pull back . i repeat , pull back .
roger that . pulling back .
all right , we &apos;ve called them off .
put the remote down .
you can stop this right now .
i am become death .
he &apos;s dead .
any contact with the plane ?
still no word .
i don &apos;t see anything on radar .
they must have dropped below range .
red hawk 5 , do you have visual confirmation ?
negative . i have no visual confirmation .
keep searching .
come on . somebody talk to me .
there &apos;s nothing .
this is ia61 .
we just made an emergency landing . over .
good job , everybody .
hey , sweetie .
oh , it &apos;s so good to hear your voice .
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m on my way home right now .
i can &apos;t wait to see you .
&quot; we knew the world would not be the same .
some people laughed . a few people cried .
most people were silent . &quot;
