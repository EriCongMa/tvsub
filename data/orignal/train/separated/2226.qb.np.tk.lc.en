it &apos;s dying .
the dark one can &apos;t die .
but rumplestiltskin can .
want to find who wrote this book and ask them
to write me a happy ending .
now then ... it &apos;s time villains finally win .
i don &apos;t know . do we really need color ?
&quot; do we really need color ? &quot;
do we need to settle for what came before ?
don &apos;t you want to really see the world ?
it &apos;s a complicated place ,
and people are complex creatures .
their interior lives are painted with many different hues and shades .
and the zenith marseille color tv ...
it brings the profound complications of the universe
right into your living room .
does it have a clicker ?
what ?
a clicker .
you mean the space command remote ?
why , that &apos;s included in the price , sir .
now we &apos;re talking .
were you a ranger ?
damn right .
25th infantry division .
you were in the service ?
you bet ... 187th airborne , company &quot; a. &quot;
we heard a lot about your unit .
you guys were real heroes .
tell you what ... why don &apos;t you take this out for a test drive , huh ?
see how it feels .
what the hell are you doing , isaac ?
rambling on about weird technical crap ?
you &apos;re supposed to be selling .
i was .
no . no .
you were sending them across the street to gimbels .
now , i hired you because you said you wanted to be a writer .
i am a writer .
stacks of rejected manuscripts in the break room don &apos;t count .
but i figured you knew something about telling stories .
that &apos;s how you sell .
but now i get why you don &apos;t have a picture on the back of a book yet .
you don &apos;t tell stories people want .
maybe that &apos;s about to change .
hello ?
over here .
i @-@ i &apos;m isaac heller .
yes , i know who you are .
please ... take a seat .
i &apos;ve never met a publisher before .
i &apos;m not sure exactly how this works .
so , you want to publish a book . is there a contract ...
you may find that our organization does things a bit ... differently .
choose one .
oh , actually , i &apos;m more of an ibm selectric kind of guy .
choose one .
okay .
okay .
what is this ?
some kind of signing bonus ?
the last time i got a fountain pen was for my bar mitzvah .
this is a test .
we need to know what kind of writer you really are .
choose the one that calls out to you .
what the hell was that ?
it is a sign ...
that you are to be our next author .
you see , the last one ...
well ...
he just recently passed away .
author of what ?
there is much to explain .
how would you like to take a trip ?
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not so great with traveling .
i @-@ i &apos;ve never been further than scarsdale .
yes , i know . but that is about to change .
the time has come to stop selling televisions .
the time has come to take on
the most important job in all the realms .
what the hell ?
you can see that ?
i see it , but i don &apos;t believe it .
actually , the fact that you can see it
tells me that you do believe .
believe in what ?
in magic .
i think it is time that you find your destiny .
come with me .
all of your questions will be answered .
nothing .
they &apos;re all still blank .
whatever the author is writing ,
it &apos;s not appearing in the books .
this is useless .
easy .
this is not your fault .
even so , tomorrow , thanks to gold and the author ,
i can wake up a talking frog .
at least you &apos;ll wake up .
i don &apos;t doubt whatever the dark one has in store for me
is a far worse fate .
well , there &apos;s no use speculating what he wants .
we just need to stop it .
and if there &apos;s nothing useful here ,
we need to move on ,
find something else that can help .
i might know just the thing .
august .
i thought you didn &apos;t know anything more about the author .
he doesn &apos;t , but he knows someone who does .
that &apos;s why i called him here .
who ?
the man who gave him his power ...
the apprentice .
i met him once when i was living in phuket .
he was the one who told me about the story book
and that i should learn everything about it .
if he was in storybrooke , could you find him ?
well , i haven &apos;t seen him .
but ...
... that &apos;s what he looks like .
i know this man .
you do ?
more importantly , i know exactly where to find him .
i trapped him in there . i didn &apos;t know .
it &apos;s okay . it was gold , not you .
blue was in there . she can get him out .
don &apos;t you need the dark one &apos;s dagger ?
well , not if i have something that belonged to the apprentice .
are you ...
yes .
and there is no time to waste .
isaac has abused his power for too long .
the time has come to set ...
... things right .
how ?
by putting him back where he can &apos;t harm anyone ... in the book .
i will need the page with the painted door and the key .
we shall return him to his prison .
and this time , i would wager
none of you will set him free again .
the page .
it &apos;s back in the loft .
mom , dad , killian , watch henry .
if gold &apos;s smart , he &apos;ll go after the page , too .
are you , uh ... close ?
hang in there , dark one .
don &apos;t let that heart turn to coal just yet .
you &apos;ll be fine .
better than ever .
why help me ?
you have the quill now .
you don &apos;t need me anymore .
we &apos;re a lot alike .
we &apos;ve both struggled mightily for happiness all our lives .
you got power , became the dark one ,
but you &apos;ve never been the content one .
i know what that &apos;s like ...
to always have dissatisfaction gnawing at you ,
watching other people &apos;s happiness bloom .
it &apos;s time for a world where up is down ,
where villains can have happy endings .
and what does your ending look like ?
a castle ?
treasure ?
power ?
in the enchanted forest ?
do you think i like dysentery and a 40 @-@ year life expectancy ?
no , no , that &apos;s your world .
i like room service and indoor plumbing .
you &apos;re welcome to a happy ending in your land .
i &apos;ll take one in mine .
continue with the writing , if you please .
of course .
i @-@ i just need one last detail .
your son ... baelfire .
don &apos;t toy with me , scribe .
magic can &apos;t bring back the dead .
no .
it can &apos;t .
this quill and ink can only change a past it has created .
which is why i have to write your new story
from this moment forward and into the future .
but ...
in your new life , i can make you forget him .
no , never .
i want my memories of him .
but maybe with a ... slight adjustment .
i would like a world where
i remember doing right by my boy .
where he may be gone , but i can live with that loss .
where bae sees me as a hero
right to the end .
i think i can do that .
and with that last piece , it &apos;s time to finish .
&quot; the end . &quot;
grandma ?
grandpa !
hook !
hello ? !
hello ? !
is anyone here ? !
hello ? !
nice parking job .
you old enough to drive ?
yeah . are you ?
i need some help .
have you seen any of these people ?
no .
no , i haven &apos;t .
it &apos;s my family .
are you sure ?
look , why don &apos;t you wait here ,
and i can , um ... i @-@ i &apos;ll ask some of the others .
yeah , i &apos;ve got someone here .
yeah , i @-@ i think he &apos;s a runaway .
thank you .
thank you very much !
please . please , please .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not worthy .
someone once told me
i don &apos;t tell stories people want .
but i say , write what you &apos;re passionate about .
that &apos;s what matters most .
&quot; heroes and villains &quot; is close to my heart .
it &apos;s been a passion project
for longer than you would believe .
i wrote it because i think
folks are sick of heroes getting everything
in these classic fairy tales .
hence , the radically different endings
for snow white , prince charming , and all the rest ...
something different for a modern audience .
what happens when villains win the day ?
thank you .
thank you .
long live regina .
please , can i give you a present ...
a little token of my love for the world that you &apos;ve created ?
regina ... she &apos;s my favorite character .
she &apos;s a real doozy , isn &apos;t she ?
her life is just so unfair .
is she gonna get a happy ending in the sequel ?
please , you have to tell me .
sure . i can tell you .
she ...
sorry . no spoilers .
you &apos;ll have to buy the next book when it &apos;s finished .
all right .
what are you doing here ?
what did you do with my family ?
and where are they ?
i , uh ...
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re lying .
now , you know what this does ,
so you either give me some answers
or i open this door again and you get a whole new ending .
okay .
much to the chagrin of my publicist ,
you have my undivided attention .
where &apos;s my family ?
you really want to know ?
look around you .
they &apos;re all right there ...
in my best @-@ selling book .
what does that mean ?
are they still alive ?
easy with the key , cowboy .
your family is fine .
if you want to get technical ...
they &apos;re in here .
see ?
the original copy of my book ...
the one that i always wanted to write .
they all live in here now in kind of an alternate reality .
you made them miserable .
i see that you &apos;ve read some of my book . good . good .
then ... then you know that everyone got the ending they deserve .
except emma , of course .
you won &apos;t find her in the book .
there was no room for a savior in my world .
bring them back , or i use this .
i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t have the power .
the cardinal rule of the authors is
&quot; don &apos;t write your own happy ending . &quot;
as you can see
i broke that rule .
so this ... it &apos;s just a pen now .
and me ?
well , i &apos;m nothing more than a best @-@ selling writer with legions of fans
and a penthouse over central park .
if you can &apos;t get them out ,
then give me the book and i will .
you ?
do you know why you &apos;re still out here , kid ?
because you &apos;re not from a magical world .
so take it from me ...
you will never be a knight in shining armor .
you &apos;re just a poor , innocent child who needs saving .
so , why don &apos;t you put the key away
and , uh , stick to the role you &apos;re best at ?
now what ?
you &apos;re gonna tear up the book ?
wait ! don &apos;t be stupid !
cool .
feel like a real hero now ?
don &apos;t get used to it .
so , now we &apos;re both trapped in the book .
congratulations .
let me tell you about this place .
it &apos;s cold , there &apos;s no running water ,
and things are always trying to kill you .
let me go !
not a chance .
this book we &apos;re in , it &apos;s worked out quite nicely for me .
i don &apos;t need you running around changing things .
this is my story .
and no hero gets a happy ending .
why ?
would that somehow destroy the book ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re afraid of .
isn &apos;t it ?
doesn &apos;t matter . you brought us into the final chapter .
how do you know ?
i know because i wrote it .
and i know how it ends ...
with the loud tolling of bells at sunset .
when you hear that sound ,
it &apos;ll mean we &apos;ve reached the last page .
the book will end ,
and everything will remain exactly how i wrote it .
there we are . right on time .
what is that ?
oh , the inciting incident of this chapter ...
an ogre attack .
and you know what they say ...
you don &apos;t have to be faster than the ogre .
you just have to be faster than the next guy .
wait !
help !
help me !
the monster is dead .
the ogre slayer saved us !
thank you .
if there &apos;s anything my family and i can do to repay you ...
good deeds have their own reward .
this comes with no price .
are you all right , boy ?
what &apos;s your name ?
uh , henry .
i am rumplestiltskin , a knight at your service .
do you have any family around here ?
y @-@ yeah .
i think so .
yeah .
then i suggest you run home for your supper , henry ,
because i ... i have another village to save .
&quot; many deadly traps were set to protect the forest hideaway ,
a pit trap under the cedar tree ... &quot;
... &quot; a falling log hung just beyond ... &quot;
... &quot; and finally , at the center of the willow forest ,
there was a rustic version of ... home . &quot;
hello ?
is anyone here ?
turn around slowly .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
my name &apos;s henry .
and i &apos;m your son .
come on , henry .
please be dead .
please be dead .
please be dead .
i should have remembered . i wrote the book .
the ogre slayer .
but i &apos;m telling you ...
that we &apos;re trapped inside a book ?
yeah .
and i &apos;m supposed to live in a place called maine ?
where i became your adopted mother
after someone named emma gave you up ?
come on , mom .
you can remember .
well , now that i think about it ...
this does make me wonder one thing .
who sent you ?
mom , please . nobody sent me .
stop calling me that !
are you working for the queen ?
no . i &apos;m trying to help you .
help me what ?
find your happy ending .
in my world , we called it &quot; operation mongoose . &quot;
that is a very silly name .
well , it was your idea .
you actually believe this .
so you &apos;re crazy .
i &apos;m not , and i can prove it .
this is a copy of the book we &apos;re trapped in .
let me see .
this ...
this says i &apos;m ... going to rob a royal tax carriage today
to buy passage out of the kingdom .
how did the book know all that ?
it can see my future ?
something like that .
then i don &apos;t want any part of it .
no !
don &apos;t follow me !
whatever world you think you &apos;re from , go back there .
i can &apos;t ... not until you find true love .
then you &apos;re stuck .
never gonna happen for me .
his name is robin hood .
i @-@ i think the only way for us to escape this book
is for you to find him in a tavern and kiss him .
true love &apos;s kiss ... it can fix anything .
you are crazy .
if i ever meet robin hood in person ,
the only thing he gets is a broken nose .
wait ... what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s my competition .
every robbery i plan , he beats me to it .
he &apos;s the reason i &apos;m stuck in this kingdom .
why am i still talking to you ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m your son .
look , kid .
if you read about me in that book ,
you know i got to go .
the queen wants me dead .
she thinks i ruined her life .
did you ?
yes .
so ...
if it &apos;s happy endings you &apos;re after ,
look someplace else .
henry !
where &apos;d you go ?
come on out ! i can help you !
oh , no .
not these guys .
welcome to the queen &apos;s woods , trespasser .
don &apos;t kill me ! don &apos;t kill me !
don &apos;t kill me ! ! no , don &apos;t kill me ! ! no , no ! !
search him .
no . no .
no .
no !
oh , goody . look at this .
&quot; long live regina &quot; ?
so , you &apos;re a trespasser and a traitor .
that &apos;s not mine .
hi @-@ ho , boys .
it &apos;s off to work we go .
you .
speak .
we found him in the queen &apos;s woods , your majesty ...
with this .
&quot; long live regina &quot; ?
not very likely .
although , she &apos;ll certainly live longer than you .
now , what do we remove first ?
your fingers ?
or your ears ?
no removing . please .
i @-@ i hate regina as much as you do .
i &apos;m on your side .
technically , you &apos;re at my feet .
we want the same thing ...
to keep everything in this realm exactly how it is ,
with you in charge .
a boy just arrived in this land .
he fancies himself a hero .
he wants to take away everything you have .
somebody has to stop him .
get in here !
finally ... someone listens to me .
no need to yell , snow .
i will always find you .
i &apos;m sorry ... you will always find me , what ?
i will always find you , your majesty .
that &apos;s better .
now , will you please help me with something ?
remove his head .
of course , your majesty .
no , no , no ! you don &apos;t understand !
i can help you ! i know things !
i know who snow white really loves !
what did you say ?
you had a twin brother ... james .
he was the one who snow truly loved ...
before the tragedy .
want me to kill him , your majesty ?
save you both the trouble ?
let him speak .
how do you know this ?
a magical book told me everything about this land .
james was cruel ... like you .
you understood each other .
you fell in love .
it was everything .
but then , because of regina , he died .
so you took charming &apos;s heart and you forced him to be yours ,
but it never satisfied you .
he &apos;s just a pale imitation of his brother .
it &apos;s a sad story .
but it can still have a happy ending .
how ?
i know exactly where to find regina .
revenge can be yours .
and what is it that you want in return ...
aside from your life ?
the boy i told you about ... henry ...
he &apos;ll be trying to help regina .
i want you to kill them both .
gladly .
snow white .
surprised to see me ?
charming , disarm her .
i &apos;ve waited so long for this moment .
your head is going to look lovely in my trophy room .
please , snow .
how many times do i have to say i &apos;m sorry ?
once more ...
from your grave .
i didn &apos;t know what would happen to james .
i was a child . i was only trying to help you .
you broke a promise .
because of your poor , poor judgment ,
my true love is dead .
your majesty , before you rip her heart out ,
perhaps you should ask her about the boy .
so , you do have a brain somewhere in that pretty head .
where &apos;s the boy ?
where ... is ... he ?
when does this end , snow ?
this blood feud ... when does it stop ?
when i &apos;ve killed you and every one of your followers .
you lost one happy ending .
and i &apos;m sorry for that , but ...
all this killing will only bring more hatred into your life ,
and all you &apos;ll be left with is a hole in your heart ...
and no hope of ever finding true happiness .
you ...
... know nothing of my happiness .
come on !
milady .
i had the situation under control .
a simple &quot; thank you &quot; would suffice .
i told you i didn &apos;t need rescuing .
believe me , i &apos;m already questioning helping the competition .
competition ?
robin hood ?
well , i &apos;m not friar tuck .
now hold still , please , milady .
why ?
because this may sting a little .
now sit down before you pass out .
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just a scratch .
what &apos;s that ?
your cut .
you still can &apos;t say &quot; thank you , &quot; can you ?
thank you .
and thank you .
so , to ...
new friends and old rivals .
what is it ?
just thought you &apos;d be ...
dirtier .
well , thank you . i &apos;ll choose to take that as a compliment .
regina , while we may never have met ,
i always admired your skills .
i &apos;m getting out of this game ,
and i have a proposition for you .
i &apos;m in search of someone to take my place
as leader of the merry men .
i &apos;m flattered , but ...
... can &apos;t accept .
this forest isn &apos;t the place for me anymore .
well , that &apos;s a shame .
so , what &apos;s driving you out of the business ?
have you ever met someone
that you would change your entire world for ?
someone whose eyes you just knew you were born to gaze into ?
i have .
and that &apos;s why i can &apos;t be a thief anymore .
it wouldn &apos;t be fair to my new bride .
bride ?
well , she will be when we marry later today .
hello , darling .
so , who &apos;s this ?
regina , i &apos;d like you to meet my fiancée .
this is zelena .
i just can &apos;t believe i &apos;m finally meeting the bandit regina .
thank you , but i should go .
oh , w @-@ well , why don &apos;t you stay for the ceremony ?
i mean , it &apos;ll be a simple affair , but ...
we &apos;d love to have you there , wouldn &apos;t we , darling ?
of course .
it would be our honor .
o @-@ oh , i ...
i should try to get a head start on snow white .
i &apos;m sure she has the entire black guard looking for me .
thank you .
for saving my life .
congratulations again .
both of you .
so ?
mom !
you have to stop calling me that .
how do you keep finding me , anyway ?
i figured if my plan worked ,
you &apos;d be in sherwood forest with robin hood .
i hate to break it to you ,
but robin &apos;s already found his true love .
and they &apos;re getting married ...
today .
no , no , no . t @-@ this is all wrong .
that &apos;s zelena , your siste--
wait . you have to listen to me .
i heard enough .
i don &apos;t have a sister .
my mother abandoned me when i was a baby .
no , your mother abandoned zelena .
everything &apos;s flipped . this must be zelena &apos;s happy ending .
look , i have to go .
and you should , too . snow white &apos;s looking for you .
wait .
you can &apos;t tell me
that you didn &apos;t feel anything when you met robin hood .
see ? that &apos;s proof .
he &apos;s your true love .
no .
it &apos;s proof that i &apos;m not the kind of person that gets a happy ending .
i &apos;ll never have true love .
but you ...
you gave me the worst thing you can give anyone .
hope .
now , i &apos;d like to get far enough away
that i don &apos;t have to hear
robin and zelena &apos;s wedding bells proclaim their love .
wait ... did you say &quot; wedding bells &quot; ?
yes . now please let me be .
the bells ... from the end of the book .
that &apos;s what he was talking about .
those bells ... this wedding ...
it &apos;s our last chance to stop this from becoming real forever !
it already is real .
not yet .
we have to stop this wedding .
look ...
you seem like a nice boy .
and clearly , you believe all this ...
nonsense .
but didn &apos;t you say i was your adopted mother ?
that you have another mother out there , named , uh ...
emma ?
so , if you want help , maybe you should start by finding her .
i tried .
she wasn &apos;t in the book .
and if she were , believe me , you &apos;d know .
she &apos;s the most powerful sorceress there is .
the only sorceress in this land is snow white .
she &apos;s more powerful than her .
she has , uh , special magic .
special magic ?
in our world , she was called &quot; the savior . &quot;
never heard of her .
mom . no , i know that face .
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
there were rumors once of a woman who called herself that .
the savior .
isaac lied .
he couldn &apos;t write her out of the story .
where can i find her ?
you can &apos;t .
snow white locked her up years ago .
no one has set eyes on her since .
the prison she &apos;s in is impenetrable .
look !
it &apos;s him !
belle !
sounds like someone else wants to celebrate your return .
and how is the newest member of our dear family ?
with any luck , he &apos;ll grow up to be just like dear old dad .
belle . you didn &apos;t tell me we had a visitor .
name &apos;s isaac .
i was traveling through your village ,
when your wife invited me in to slake my thirst .
not to be too picky ,
but the water tastes a little murky .
i &apos;ll get some that &apos;s fresh from the well .
you didn &apos;t come here for the water .
perceptive in all worlds .
good . yes .
i came here to warn you .
your happiness is in danger .
from what ?
a boy .
he &apos;s on a mission to help the bandit regina .
if he succeeds , everything you have will be destroyed .
not to mention what i have .
what nonsense .
how can some stranger &apos;s actions affect my life ?
because your happiness , your entire life --
it &apos;s not real .
i know because i am the one who created it -- with magic .
and it is all about to crumble .
regina &apos;s true love is about to marry another .
she &apos;s going to try and stop the wedding .
you cannot let her succeed .
you have to kill her .
demon ! you &apos;ve been sent here to try to corrupt me .
you have already been corrupted .
before all of this , you were a villain --
maybe the worst one of all .
which is why you had me use magic
to rewrite your story .
look , i can prove it to you .
i @-@ i know things --
the secrets that you &apos;ve kept from belle ,
the ones about your first son -- baelfire .
where did you hear that name ?
in this story , he was killed in the ogre wars
despite your heroic efforts .
but in reality , he died because of your cowardice .
no , no , no . i --
i protected him . i did my best .
i ...
i was honorable .
no .
you weren &apos;t .
he died because of you .
liar !
get out of here -- now .
all right . i &apos;ll go .
but deep down , you know i &apos;m right .
you &apos;re not really a hero .
and if you don &apos;t kill regina
and keep her from her happy ending ,
then everyone , including belle , will know , too .
i know you &apos;ll make the right choice , rumple .
you always do .
ahoy !
is anyone here ? !
careful , boy .
no one steps aboard the jolly roger &apos;s decks
without an invitation from its captain first .
are you gonna make me walk the plank ?
all depends on why you &apos;re here .
i need a ship to take me to the bottomless sea .
now , those are treacherous waters .
there must be something of great value there
to be worth taking the risk .
&quot; someone . &quot;
her name is emma . she &apos;s my mom .
and she was put there by the queen .
well , then , i &apos;m sorry for you .
even if i wanted to , i can &apos;t help you .
why ? you &apos;re a captain .
can &apos;t you take your ship wherever you want ?
a captain ?
is that who he says he is ?
i thought i told you
to be done swabbing the decks when i return .
i &apos;m sorry , captain black beard .
wait-- he &apos;s the captain ?
indeed .
unless deckhand hook wants to keep playing pretend .
what do you say , hook ?
beat me , and the jolly roger is yours .
or are you still a one @-@ handed coward ?
what are you doing ? ! stand up to him !
you can beat him .
i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t know me very well .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help you .
then i &apos;ll have to help you .
what the bloody hell are you doing ? !
getting you your ship back .
come on . let &apos;s dump black beard and go .
you think it &apos;s that easy ?
i can &apos;t sail the jolly roger alone .
i can help .
how do you know how to sail a ship ?
i had a great teacher-- you .
look !
we found it !
there &apos;s a black knight standing guard .
only one .
we can take him out .
well , you perhaps you hadn &apos;t noticed ,
but i &apos;m a deckhand , not a soldier .
then maybe we don &apos;t need to fight .
i &apos;m here on official business for the queen ,
delivering a dangerous prisoner from the kingdom of kashyyyk .
well done , lad .
the wookiee prisoner gag-- it always work .
the what ?
never mind .
lock the guard in the cell .
i &apos;ll be back with my mom as soon as i can .
what--
my name is--
henry .
mom ?
henry .
you-- you remember .
i knew you &apos;d find me .
i don &apos;t understand .
how do you remember when no one else does ?
must have been part of gold &apos;s plan .
my punishment in this world is that i know the truth
but i &apos;m powerless to do anything about it .
in this world , i &apos;m no longer the savior .
i &apos;ve got no magic .
that &apos;s all right .
i think i know what to do .
now , come on .
uh , killian , this is my mom .
mom , killian .
yeah , um ...
pleasure .
yeah . right .
look , we need to ... get going .
we &apos;ve got a wedding to stop .
thank you for your help , killian .
uh , yeah , of course .
i &apos;m pleased you regained your , uh , your freedom .
me too . unfortunately , it &apos;s not gonna last
unless we put some distance
between that tower and us before the guard wakes up .
why ?
because that was not any ordinary black knight .
her name is lily .
she &apos;s dangerous .
i don &apos;t understand . what &apos;s the problem with this lily ?
henry , get below now !
i need you to load the cannon with a chain shot .
come on ! now !
hold your fire till i tell you !
lily , over here !
come on , lily ! come on !
now !
that was close .
cheers .
you did it .
we did it .
what is that ?
it &apos;s goat &apos;s milk .
where &apos;s your rum ?
i &apos;m allergic . never touch the stuff .
of course you are .
can i ask you a question ?
you trusted me with your life just now . why ?
it &apos;s complicated .
might take a while .
my schedule &apos;s pretty clear .
okay .
let &apos;s first work on your fighting skills .
then we &apos;ve got to help regina stop that wedding .
where is regina &apos;s heart ?
no one ?
and what of the child ?
surely you imbeciles aren &apos;t all stupid enough
to report back here empty @-@ handed .
actually , your majesty , they are exactly that stupid .
we would have caught the bandit
if blue and her gaggle of uglies
hadn &apos;t laid a trap of dark fairy dust ,
paralyzing our axes .
always blaming the fairies .
maybe you should try and take responsibility for once , dwarf .
you mangy , flea @-@ infested wolf .
i should get a muzzle ...
silence .
we aren &apos;t here to fight .
we &apos;re a team .
so you &apos;re not ... mad ?
of course not .
it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s mine .
you see , i am your leader ,
and i have to lead by example .
we have to go to extreme lengths to succeed .
and to do that ...
... i have to show you how .
i have to motivate you .
well , now you &apos;re down to six .
do you want to make it five ?
find regina and the boy and kill them .
you &apos;re telling me that ... in this other reality ,
i &apos;m an expert with such a weapon ?
you &apos;re a regular jack sparrow .
is that good ?
here . let me show you how to use it .
they say once you become an expert ,
your subconscious takes over .
back in my world , that &apos;s what we call muscle memory .
tell me more about this reality you want to return to .
us , for example .
i sense that we , uh ... we may be close .
very .
really ?
well , i &apos;m starting to get jealous of the other me .
let &apos;s see what food henry &apos;s discovered .
i &apos;m starving .
there they are .
it &apos;s as i told you , my queen .
the one @-@ handed pirate was helping them .
and the boy was with them , as well .
tell us where the child is hiding !
back off , dwarf !
or they &apos;ll change your name to &quot; stumpy &quot; !
i know you .
you &apos;re ...
emma .
the mad hag who was locked in the tower .
i almost didn &apos;t recognize you out of your chains .
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s hard to recognize -- both of you .
this isn &apos;t who you are .
tell me -- who are we ?
you &apos;re my parents .
i &apos;m the product of your true love .
you taught me how to be a hero ,
you taught me how to believe in hope .
and i do .
and now i need you to believe in it , too .
you &apos;re right .
emma .
hope is a very powerful thing .
which is why i &apos;m going to have to snuff it out of you
and that awful son of yours .
kill them .
wait !
there he is .
my , my .
i am going to enjoy watching him die in front of his mother .
save henry .
killian , you can &apos;t beat them .
if i can help return things to how they were meant to be ,
then what happens to me here won &apos;t matter , will it ?
now go . save your boy .
is she worth your life , pirate ?
i &apos;m wiing to find out .
what do you know ? i &apos;m a natural .
what about you , your majesty ?
shall i make quick work --
no !
i never did like pirates .
mom !
we have to get out of here ! mom !
what -- what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve just learned ...
of a threat to our realm .
if left unchecked ...
it &apos;ll destroy all that we &apos;ve built together .
all our happiness .
but you &apos;re the light one .
whatever this force is , you &apos;ll overcome it .
it &apos;s more complicated than that .
eliminating this threat
means i have to make a difficult choice .
and if i make the wrong one --
but ... you won &apos;t .
you never do .
you &apos;re a hero , rumple .
yeah , but what if i &apos;m not ?
here .
things never seem quite as bleak after a cup of tea .
belle , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s fine .
see ? it &apos;s just chipped .
we can fix it .
i &apos;m not so sure it &apos;s as simple as that .
mom !
i knew you &apos;d still be here .
you again ?
listen , i @-@ i don &apos;t have time for stories .
i need to hit the road before the evil queen has my head .
wait . i brought someone else this time .
maybe you &apos;ll listen to her .
regina .
let me guess --
you &apos;re his other mother .
emma .
i have to give you credit .
breaking her out of that tower couldn &apos;t have been easy .
henry , can you give us a minute ?
sure .
you know , your son can use some reining in .
he &apos;s been running around the forest ,
getting into trouble , spouting nonsense .
regina , everything he said about this reality -- it &apos;s all true .
i doubt that .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m wasting my time
with a madwoman who ... calls herself the savior .
because i can help .
your happiness is still a possibility .
your first step is going after the man you love .
my happy ending isn &apos;t a man .
of course not .
but love is a part of all happiness ,
and you have to be open to that .
go to robin hood .
all you have to do is tell him how you feel .
oh , is that all ?
you forgot to mention the part
where i &apos;d have to crash his wedding .
what does your heart tell you ?
i know what my heart says .
but what if his doesn &apos;t say the same thing ?
isn &apos;t that a risk you &apos;re willing to take ?
i just watched the man i love die .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s horrible .
the worst part is that i never told him i loved him .
not once .
i was too scared .
too scared that ...
somehow , saying it would make it real ...
and change everything .
but now i &apos;ll never have a chance to take that next step with him ,
because he &apos;s gone .
my only chance with him
is if you don &apos;t make the same mistake i did .
we haven &apos;t heard the wedding bells yet .
there &apos;s still time .
i don &apos;t even know what to say to him .
i think , in this case , actions speak louder than words .
once you and robin share true love &apos;s kiss ,
everything should be great again .
okay .
what ?
you don &apos;t remember this , but i promised you once
i &apos;d help you find your happy ending .
just glad i &apos;m here to see it .
you got this , regina .
i &apos;m afraid none of you are crashing this wedding ...
dearies .
go . i got the dark one .
&quot; dark one &quot; ?
i &apos;m afraid you have the wrong name , dearie .
we &apos;ll see about that .
regina , go !
let all who have gathered here ...
do you , zelena , take robin to be your lawfully wedded husband ?
i do .
mom !
out of my way , boy .
you have to get through me to get to her !
and do you , robin , take zelena to be your lawfully wedded wife ?
go ! you have to stop that wedding !
robin ?
you won &apos;t hurt me .
you &apos;re supposed to be a hero here .
and that &apos;s exactly why i must do this --
to ensure i remain one .
mom .
it &apos;s done .
mom ?
regina ?
mom .
why didn &apos;t you go into the church ?
i ... i couldn &apos;t let you die .
we &apos;re at the end of the book .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to change anything now .
sorry .
regina ?
regina !
robin ?
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , now i &apos;ve got blood on my dress !
can &apos;t you see she &apos;s injured ?
this is supposed to be my day !
and she &apos;s ruined it !
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
no .
no , i &apos;m not .
no .
at least i can promise you ...
you won &apos;t die alone .
too little , too late .
then you &apos;re gonna change things .
return them to the way they were .
bring back hook .
save regina .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m not the author anymore .
i can &apos;t change a thing .
kid , what the hell ?
no .
what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s the next author .
i @-@ i can feel it .
henry . fix it .
write everything the way it was .
without ink , he &apos;s not writing anything .
my blood . it was supposed to work last time .
yes , when mixed with darkness ,
but you &apos;re not the savior here .
because of him .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we didn &apos;t find one .
and in this world , we don &apos;t need a dark savior .
we need a light one .
hold on , mom .
no , don &apos;t !
henry , do it !
&quot; thanks to the hero regina &apos;s sacrifice ,
isaac &apos;s villainous work was undone . &quot;
henry ?
you did it .
no , mom .
we did .
mom !
henry .
hook .
where is he ?
where &apos;s hook ?
uh , h @-@ he was there --
right before we got dragged away .
everyone reappeared where they were before this whole mess started .
no .
yeah , sorry about the mess .
i really needed to find that book ,
and i &apos;m usually a bit tidier .
killian .
how many times do i have to tell you , love ?
i &apos;m a survivor .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to cause any panic .
i awoke moments before your parents
and came up here , looking for your boy .
he &apos;s fine . henry &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m just ... glad you are , too .
what is it ?
when i ...
watched you die ...
i was afraid i was never gonna get a chance
to tell you something .
tell me what ?
that ... i ...
... want to thank you for sacrificing yourself .
henry and i wouldn &apos;t have succeeded without you .
of course , love .
it &apos;s all in a day &apos;s work for a hero .
no . w @-@ w-- wait a minute .
where are you going ?
sorry -- can &apos;t risk that bum ticker of yours slowing me down .
he &apos;s all yours , lady .
belle .
you came back for me .
i came back to make sure
you weren &apos;t going to try to hurt anyone else .
no , belle . y @-@ you don &apos;t understand .
i only did what i -- i thought was --
rumple ?
rumple ? !
wait .
i need to see --
not on that list ?
no best @-@ seller , no fans , no awards .
it &apos;s all gone .
my life .
i need to know .
years ago , you set us on a path
to hurt maleficent and her daughter .
why &apos;d you want to hurt us so badly ?
the truth , charming ?
it &apos;s not you , but who you represent .
you remind me of a boss that i once had .
one bad boss started all this ?
a lifetime of bad bosses --
of people like you , who fancy themselv heroes ,
pushing around people like me .
it was my turn to win ,
to be the hero .
but you became a villain .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what villains do --
they make themselves happy at the expense of others .
but it just makes them more unhappy .
i know what it is to feel your heart go dark .
and that ...
that isn &apos;t something to idolize .
it &apos;s something to pity .
it is tempting , is it not ?
the power of the quill ?
i @-@ i just keep thinking --
maybe i could use it just one more time ...
... to bring back my dad .
henry ...
not even an author can bring back the dead ,
no matter how much they might wish it .
but hook was dead , and then i brought him back to life --
hook &apos;s death was never real .
that was a fiction created by isaac .
and now , thanks to you , that fiction has been erased .
you see ?
all gone .
but your father , baelfire , died in the real world .
and that , sadly , can never be undone .
the best way to show your love for those that are gone
is to tell their stories .
now , this book , these stories ...
... can never be erased , because ...
they are more than stories .
they are the truth .
and the truth is what you must write .
i hope that you can resist the temptation of the quill .
the power to change reality
is only outweighed by the cost .
no one should have that much power .
it would seem that , this time ,
we have found the right person for the job .
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s my heart .
the last human fleck of red ... is disappearing .
your ability to love .
at least , in the end ...
i got one last taste .
we were happy in there .
we were in love .
i was already in love .
everything we had in the book ,
you -- you could have had here .
you could have been a good man with a good marriage for real .
why wasn &apos;t it good enough ?
because i didn &apos;t believe it .
who could ever love me ?
i knew what i was getting , rumple .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t going to pull back .
but i made you do just that .
there &apos;s a whole world out there , belle , for you .
go with will .
i don &apos;t love will .
and i &apos;m not letting you die alone .
go far away .
when the man is gone ...
only the dark one remains .
and that is more ...
... that &apos;s more dangerous than ...
... you can ever imagi--
rumple !
rumple !
hello .
so , not to puncture the party ,
but did you check on zelena ?
still locked up , still pregnant ,
but that &apos;s something we &apos;ll be able to deal with .
together .
so , will is looking after roland .
perhaps i could take you for a walk in the moonlight ?
perhaps .
i didn &apos;t mean to kill you .
though , to be fair , i didn &apos;t have a heart .
so it &apos;s my fault ?
what i think he means to say is ...
we are sorry .
eh , you don &apos;t need to be sorry .
although i do intend to hold it over your heads for a very long time .
i think we both know what happened in that world
was not real .
although , seeing you guys as real villains
made me sorry for holding a grudge against you for so long .
give me a second .
what &apos;s up ? something wrong ?
do you remember this ?
yeah .
i nearly got hepatitis stealing it back
from your boyfriend &apos;s rat @-@ infested place .
it &apos;s a piece of the egg i was hatched from .
it &apos;s also the only clue i have as to who my father is .
have you asked your mother ?
she doesn &apos;t know , either .
what ?
it &apos;s a dragon thing .
you know , it ... happened in dragon form .
do you want to find him ?
do you mind if i stick around storybrooke and look ?
i think that &apos;d be great .
rumple , his heart . he said it &apos;s almost gone .
and , uh ...
he said we &apos;re in danger .
he tried to use the hat to free himself from the dagger .
this is not unlike that .
we &apos;re pulling the darkness from him and containing it .
does that mean that his heart will be healed ?
perhaps -- if the strength is there .
this is more dark power
than the hat has ever been asked to contain .
do what you need to do .
&quot; purest evil , blackest bloom .
darkness , too , can find its doom . &quot;
&quot; never dying , but contained .
bound inside the falcon &apos;s chamber .
shorn of anger , thornless danger .
there forever to remain . &quot;
he &apos;s barely breathing .
rumplestiltskin was the dark one for centuries .
his return to the man he used to be will not be easy .
this will preserve him
until we discern if we can help him .
&quot; if &quot; ?
everybody step back .
mom , dad ! go after it !
go ! i &apos;ll be right there .
help me make him comfortable .
what was that ?
long before ... your stories began ...
the sorcerer battled the darkness .
he was able to keep it from consuming the realms .
he tethered it to a human soul
that could be controlled with a dagger .
the dark one .
the sorcerer is the only one with the power
to destroy the darkness once and for all
before it destroys everything .
where is he ? who is he ?
he &apos;s far , far from here .
find him .
his name is ...
... merlin .
you must ... stop ...
the darkness .
find ... merlin .
where is it ? !
we don &apos;t know .
it just disappeared into the night .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
the dark one -- it &apos;s no longer tethered to the crocodile .
what ? !
where the hell is it ?
it hasn &apos;t gone anywhere .
the darkness -- it &apos;s surrounding us .
regina !
what &apos;s it doing ? !
what darkness does --
snuffing out the light .
i &apos;m not gonna let it .
that &apos;s not gonna work on this thing !
the apprentice told me
we have to do what the sorcerer did !
we have to tether it to a person to contain it !
emma !
no !
there has to be another way !
there isn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve worked to hard to have your happiness destroyed .
no !
you figured out how to take the darkness out of me once .
you need to do it again --
as heroes .
emma ! emma , please !
no .
don &apos;t do this .
i love you .
no !
