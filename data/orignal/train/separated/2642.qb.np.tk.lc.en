华盛顿特区
i do apologize for keeping you waiting .
mikhail kozlov .
are you the embassy intelligence chief ?
we are not here to discuss my curriculum vitae , agent keen ,
only to ascertain why you are here
and what you hope to accomplish
nowthat the f.b.i. has surrounded the embassy .
i am not here to speak to a pawn without adequate clearance .
nor are we here to harbor foreign agents of the f.b.i. ,
agent keen .
my name is masha rostova .
i am a deep cover operative
for the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti .
i have successfully completed my mission
and am hereby seeking asylum .
i would appreciate an immediate and private audience
with your chief intelligence officer .
звони .
i need to speak to whoever &apos;s in command of security ,
and i need to do it now .
you understand ?
ressler .
i just got off the line with reven wright .
did we get the go @-@ ahead ?
the state department has requested
that the russians bring her out .
requested ?
nobody would be making a request if it was bin laden in there .
on u.s. soil ? we &apos;d be blasting our way in .
the russian embassy isn &apos;t u.s. soil .
that fence is a border .
crossing it is tantamount to armed invasion .
it &apos;s literally an act of war .
i know , but look around .
the war &apos;s already started .
agent keen .
or do you prefer &quot; rostova &quot; ?

connie , leave it .
patience , golubushka . duty calls .
oh , connie .
what a delightful nod to tradition .
i can &apos;t tell you how nostalgic it is
to see a russian bureaucrat demonstrating
such a time @-@ honored absence of work ethic .
connie ? is someone here ?
no , darling .
keep the shower running . i &apos;ll be right in .
i bought us a toy .
she &apos;s much prettier than she looks
sitting behind the news anchor desk .
get out .
plus , she &apos;s married to a ranking member
of the senate foreign relations committee .
only fair , i suppose , given the black book military aid
he &apos;s allocated to crimea .
reciprocity &apos;s a bitch , right connie ?
you screw the bear , the bear screws back .
batteries not included .
by all means , do call in the troops .
what with your government &apos;s implication
in the o.r.e.a. bombing
and assassinations of the sitting senator
and the attorney general of the united states ,
how much harm could a weekly game of water wiggle
between their ambassador and a senator &apos;s wife cause ?
barely a blip in the news cycle .
though , i doubt the kremlin
will be nearly as jejune as i am .
what do you want ?
that &apos;s the spirit , connie . service with a smile .
the reason your underlings are so rudely interrupting
your weekly tryst is because elizabeth keen
turned herself in to your embassy
and has identified herself
as a deep cover f.s.b. agent in distress .
that &apos;s absurd .
yes , quite .
nevertheless , she &apos;s currently demanding diplomatic immunity .
and i want real @-@ time reports of everything--
everything that occurs inside that building ,
especially the names of every drone
in the decision loop between here and moscow .
that won &apos;t present a problem , will it , connie ?
duty calls , comrade .
who are you ?
alexander raskovich ,
f.s.b. chief intelligence agent for washington , d.c. ,
which makes me senior intelligence agent
for the entire western hemisphere .
i am intimately acquainted with
every single russian intelligence asset
in north and south america ,
active and inactive .
and you , dear , are not one of them .
which begs a question --
why are you masquerading as such
when you and i both know you are no such thing ?
i came here to protect myself , to get your help
because our interests are aligned .
your country and i have been blamed for crimes
we did not commit .
it was committed by a global consortium
known in some quarters as the cabal .
what are their objectives ?
to reignite the cold war
between russia and the united states .
and to what end ?
i will tell you everything that i know
after i &apos;ve been guaranteed , in writing ,
diplomatic immunity .
how do i know that you &apos;re not working for the cabal ?
how do i know that you &apos;re not here posing as a victim
to gain safe passage away from the f.b.i. ?
the russian assassin , the one known as karakurt .
never heard of him .
he &apos;s been turned .
the cabal framed me .
who better than the daughter of a k.g.b. agent ?
katarina rostova .
a k.g.b. agent was turned , but it wasn &apos;t me .
it was karakurt . he &apos;s gone .
check , and when you &apos;ve confirmed he &apos;s missing ,
draw up my immunity agreement .
did we get the breach order ?
negative .
the russians are denying the state department &apos;s request .
they &apos;re not going to turn her in .
is the white house involved ? are they gonna make the call ?
we &apos;ve been ordered to stand down .
they &apos;re harboring a terrorist .
the state department has been very clear .
they want this handled diplomatically .
hold your positions .
my superiors are willing to hear you out .
if they believe you , they will do what they can to help .
but not here .
you &apos;re being transferred to moscow for debriefing .
don &apos;t you see that &apos;s playing right into the cabal &apos;s narrative ?
the minute i leave u.s. soil ,
my government will interpret that as a defection .
i have delivered a decision .
choose , agent keen --
moscow ,
or you can take your chances with your compatriots outside .
вы верены ?
да .
да , я подожду .
where &apos;s my wedding ring ?
bedside table , behind the ben wa balls .
you .
me ?
and i was so riveted ... by her interview
with those identical triplets from milwaukee .
спасибо .
agent keen is leaving the embassy .
she &apos;s been arrested ?
the kremlin has ordered her transfer to moscow .
who in the kremlin ?
it was authorized by the federal tariff service ,
of all things .
vitsin .
удачи .
the package is in transit .
excellent .
see agent keen to the airport .
our people on the plane will take it from there .
ressler .
ressler , don &apos;t .
if you &apos;re gonna tell me that diplomatic vehicles
have the same protection as the embassy --
you know they do .
as long as she &apos;s inside that car ,
she &apos;s on russian soil . you can &apos;t touch her .
i can &apos;t let her go .
ressler .
i know you &apos;re angry . so am i.
but how we feel is not important .
taking her into custody is .
we are doing everything we can .
are we ? really ?
within the law , yes , really .
ressler .
donald , you cannot let agent keen leave the embassy .
oh , you want a favor ?
how &apos; bout you come down here and ask him personally ?
her life depends on it .
&apos;cause i &apos;d be more inclined to help if i had you in cuffs .
you cannot let her leave .
you &apos;re preaching to the choir &apos; cause she &apos;s already gone .
i received direct confirmation from the russian ambassador
that agent keen &apos;s transfer was authorized
by a high @-@ level apparatchik in the federal tariff service ,
a man named vladimir vitsin .
vitsin ?
yes , the same man who signed the paperwork
facilitating karakurt &apos;s entry into the united states .
he &apos;s an operative for the cabal .
any move he makes is in service to their agenda .
they &apos;re not transporting agent keen to moscow for debriefing .
the second she gets on that plane --
she &apos;s dead .
you need to stop that convoy .
keen .
&quot; 1 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 peabody . &quot;
it &apos;s the best i could do . full pension and benefits .
if i resign .
yes , effective immediately .
in return , all charges against you will be dropped .
agent keen -- have you found her ?
i can &apos;t discuss that with you .
have you found karakurt ?
he &apos;s the terrorist , not her .
i took your case as far as the white house .
i talked to laurel hitchen . she &apos;s a friend .
she had to pull a lot of strings to get you this deal .
i appreciate what you &apos;ve done , reven . i do .
but -- - these are serious charges , harold .
you could go to jail . take the deal .
for you and for charlene . take it and move on .
if you accept the terms , harold ,
they &apos;ll drop the investigation .
if you refuse to play ball , pending the outcome ,
you &apos;ll be reassigned , paper pushing at the c.j.i.s. ,
cubicle , potted plant --
a dead end , harold .
you &apos;re better than that .
yes , i am .
you really want to do this ?
no . what i wanna do is help .
you think i &apos;m stupid , carly ?
you don &apos;t think i know what &apos;s going on ?
what are you looking at , old man ?
you all right ?
no , i &apos;m not all right .
ressler tried to kill me .
seeking asylum with the russians was a dangerous decision .
i was out of options .
at least i would &apos;ve been secure in moscow right now .
if by &quot; secure &quot; you mean &quot; dead , &quot; then yes , absolutely .
ressler wasn &apos;t trying to kill you .
he was trying to save you .
the convoy was compromised .
you want ? we got a few specials .
the best item on the menu is the pecan pie , right , chui ?
family recipe .
i &apos;ll just have coffee , thanks .
you know him ? we &apos;re safe here ?
you threw yourself in the hands of the cabal
the moment you got on that vehicle .
the only question was whether they &apos;d kill you
before or after you entered russian airspace .
clayton , you &apos;re hurting me .
no .
you deaf , old man ?
i told you to mind your own business .
turn around , bitch .
clayton ...
oh , here we go .
carly ...
what the hell ? you lookin &apos; to get yourself killed ?
you haven &apos;t the slightest clue
how to speak to a woman , have you ?
now , my friend there and i
are having a very important discussion .
so you just sit tight , enjoy your muffin ,
and if i hear you say anything
other than &quot; please &quot; or &quot; thank you &quot; to carly ,
i &apos;m gonna drag you into the men &apos;s room
and wash your mouth out with soap .
and if that doesn &apos;t work ,
i &apos;ll cut your filthy tongue out with that butter knife .
is that clear enough for you ?
agent ressler ,
what part of &quot; stand down &quot; don &apos;t you understand ?
i was ordered to let keen go and i did .
i wasn &apos;t ordered to let her die .
the transport was compromised .
says who ?
reddington .
you spoke to him ?
yeah , he called .
said the cabal had hijacked keen .
you countermanded a direct order
and attacked a diplomatic transport
on the word of one fugitive
in order to save the life of another ?
and i &apos;m willing to resign from the task force
if the intel that reddington gave us is wrong .
the driver has been hospitalized .
as soon as he can be questioned ,
we can confirm reddington &apos;s information .
okay , we &apos;ve got a sighting .
del rio diner , 1425 peabody street .
come on , pull it together .
an m.p.d.c. cruiser just pulled up out back .
what are you ...
behind the car !
all right .
ladies and gentlemen ,
please remain calm and take your seats .
clayton .
now what ?
now ... i apologize .
i am terribly sorry for the inconvenience ,
but it appears we &apos;ll all be taking an extended lunch .
however , if you remain calm and do exactly as i say ,
i promise you &apos;ll leave here with a rip @-@ roaring story
to tell your friends and families .
bon appétit .
dear , would you mind answering that phone ?
no doubt it &apos;s for me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . did i disturb you ?
they said you were sedated .
well , you know what they say ?
can &apos;t keep a good man down .
unfortunately , it &apos;s only a matter of time
before the fbi pays you a visit
and we can &apos;t have that .
because you , are what commonly referred to as ...
a loose end .
now , you should take heart ,
because if the russians are furious now ,
imagine how irate they &apos;ll be
when they learn that there &apos;s been another fatality
as a result of agent ressler &apos;s attack on your convoy .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
your heroic devotion to our cause
has earned you my most sincere respect .
godspeed , sir .
godspeed .
what do you got ?
cut the power to the building , commandeered the phone lines .
both suspects are still inside .
both suspects ?
agent keen and raymond reddington .
keen .
we believe so , but he &apos;s got the hostages
positioned as human shields .
can &apos;t get a clear view inside .
well , then , let &apos;s find out .
what are you doing ?
hold fire .
keen !
keen !
agent ressler , excellent . do you have a pen ?
because i &apos;m ready to dictate a list of my demands .
i owe you , keen .
you saved my life back at that convoy .
now let me return the favor .
come out before this gets bad .
it &apos;s already gone bad , and you &apos;re making it worse .
if you wanna repay me , do what reddington says
before somebody else gets hurt .
that &apos;s not gonna happen , and you know it .
the scene &apos;s locked down .
nowhere to go , and you got zero leverage
because i know you .
i know what you &apos;re capable of ,
and you &apos;re not gonna hurt these people .
she won &apos;t , but i will . ready ?
my demands are as follows ...
one , i want the immediate restoration of power
to this building .
two , an armored vehicle to transport us
safely and unmolested
from this door to a runway of my choosing .
three , bring me marvin gerard .
you have 90 minutes .
that &apos;s it ?
after that , a hostage dies every half @-@ hour .
that &apos;s it , agent ressler .
marvin gerard .
graduated magna cum laude from harvard
where , at the tender age of 31,
he was appointed the third youngest full professor
in the institution &apos;s history .
he served as a prosecutor for three years ,
state of new york .
later , he joined his father @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s
criminal defense firm as a full partner .
he was on the short list for an appointment
to the federal bench
when his marriage to the boss &apos;s daughter hit the skids .
serves a year for attempting to kidnap their son ,
gets disbarred .
currently , he &apos;s incarcerated for 7 to 10
in the cumberland f.c.i.
although he &apos;s been disbarred , gerard acts as shadow counsel
to some of the biggest players in the criminal underworld --
politicians , c.e.o.s ...
and one raymond reddington .
marvin gerard ?
who are you ? what am i doing here ?
i &apos;m special agent samar navabi .
you &apos;ve been briefed ?
rousted out of bed , cavity @-@ searched ,
shackled , transported like livestock ? yes .
briefed ? no .
one of your former clients
is holding 17 civilians hostage in that diner .
he &apos;s demanded that we bring you here .
which one ?
raymond reddington .
i have nothing to do with this .
i don &apos;t know what he wants from me .
i am not going in here .
well , you are going in .
if you can please disrobe .
like hell !
call my lawyer .
who is your o.i.c. ?
that would be me .
gentlemen , help mr. gerard out of his , uh , jumpsuit .
this will never work .
if he asks me ,
i &apos;m gonna have to tell him that i &apos;m wearing a wire .
it will be unethical for me to lie to my client .
let the record reflect that i am complying under duress
and that my fourth amendment right to privacy
is being violated .
as is my right not to be nauseated .
per reddington &apos;s demands .
unbelievable .
i &apos;ll get that , dear .
the first table over there .
this is not working .
lizzy , please .
take a seat .
i &apos;ll have chui bring you a piece of pie .
i promise you &apos;ll thank me .
cut it out . a lawyer ?
how is that gonna help us with this ?
lawyers find an exploit loopholes .
it &apos;s what makes them so loathsome .
and marvin gerard ...
is the most loathsome of them all .
that &apos;s what makes him so invaluable .
speak of the devil .
hello , marvin .
my parole hearing is next week .
christmas came early .
you think this is a gift ?
they &apos;ll probably tack on five more years
just seeing you breathe in my direction .
are you wired ?
of course i &apos;m wired .
i told them not to bother .
i told you not to bother .
elizabeth , marvin gerard ,
criminal attorney ...
one down .
not necessarily in that order .
finally .
i am in the presence of greatness .
you &apos;re the one .
you &apos;re the one who made him throw away his freedom .
good god , marv , let it go .
what ? you asked for my advice .
i was simply giving you , as a friend ,
a heads up regarding my plans .
you were a wonderful attorney .
and you were a terrible client .
two .
not that you &apos;re interested ,
but , uh ...
i just got engaged .
becky weinberg .
becky from the old firm ? the paralegal .
oh , my god . you old dog .
getting older by the minute .
you just extended my engagement about a decade with this stunt .
now i &apos;m never gonna make parole .
becky and i -- she &apos;s not gonna wait around .
all right , counselor , let &apos;s get down to business .
i have a situation that requires your undivided attention .
no , it doesn &apos;t . turn yourselves in .
marvin , hear me out . you don &apos;t have all the facts .
no ? but i have eyes .
and i can see that you &apos;re in here , and they are out there .
and now you &apos;re gonna start in with me about how ,
with you , there &apos;s always more than meets the eye .
no , stop !
elizabeth !
stop !
that &apos;s enough !
you broke his ribs .
sounds like his lung is punctured .
you &apos;re hurting him .
that &apos;s the only way to stop the swelling .
what do you care ?
i didn &apos;t want anybody to get hurt .
really ? seemed to me like you wanted to hurt him bad .
she didn &apos;t have a choice .
what if he &apos;d gotten her gun ? what then , carly ?
do you think any of us would be safer if he were armed ?
you think you &apos;d be safe ?
what is he working on ? a plea agreement ?
why else bring a lawyer in here other than to cut a deal ?
if you think for one second that i am interested ...
there will be no deal .
then why go to all the trouble to bring him in here ?
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
marvin gerard was one of the most respected
defense attorneys on the eastern seaboard .
perfect wife , perfect job , perfect , all of it ...
save for his son timothy .
quiet boy .
fell in with some bad eggs , it seems .
disciplinary issues , troubles at school , drug abuse .
timothy was getting a steady supply of amphetamines
from his mother &apos;s shrink -- ritalin , adderall .
she constantly bullied the boy .
marvin and his wife separated .
he fought for custody ,
contacted police , social services .
but his wife was the princess in a very prominent
and powerful legal dynasty , so no action was ever taken .
timothy remained in her sole custody .
her abuse worsened .
convinced he had no other option ,
marvin kidnapped the boy .
they tracked him down , of course .
returned the child to his mother .
marvin was disbarred , convicted , and incarcerated .
and what happened to his son ?
a year later , timothy hung himself .
he was 15 .
snipers in position for cover .
teams make simultaneous entries here and here .
flashbangs and smoke .
secure and contain the scenario .
counter minimal risk of collateral damage .
we &apos;re all set on my mark .
he can &apos;t do that , can he ? can you do that ?
no . we don &apos;t have eyes inside .
even a minimal risk of collateral damage is too much .
we wait .
reddington &apos;s not gonna hurt anybody in that building .
keen won &apos;t let him .
same girl who shot the attorney general ?
that was different .
she &apos;s in over her head .
it &apos;s probably why they got spotted .
it wasn &apos;t her that was spotted .
anonymous tip came in on reddington , not keen .
get me that 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call .
raymond .
did you read this ?
yes . it &apos;s the voice transcripts we recovered from the fulcrum .
no , i didn &apos;t ask you if you recognize it .
i asked you if you read it --
specifically section 39c , pages 216 to 217,
lines 5 through 19 .
here .
this can &apos;t be right .
god , no . it &apos;s all kinds of wrong .
this is a perilously fast run down a slippery road .
granted , you &apos;d have to hit all green lights , but ...
yeah , we could make it work .
he -- he can &apos;t breathe ! somebody help him !
no , not you ! get away from him !
his chest cavity is filling with blood .
his lungs are gonna collapse
if we don &apos;t get him medical attention
in the next 20 to 30 minutes tops .
fine .
he &apos;ll be in agent ressler &apos;s capable care by then .
we &apos;re leaving .
leaving ?
attention , everyone .
we &apos;re done here ,
so if you could all be so kind as to gather up your belongings
and step into the kitchen .
except you two . you stay right there .
lucinda ?
chui , be a pal .
wrap up two slices of that delicious pecan pie .
i spent five years tracking reddington
and can count on one hand the number of times
we got a credible sighting .
i found the 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call .
wait a second .
i &apos;m very disappointed , donald .
i would &apos;ve expected you of all people
would &apos;ve understood that when i make a demand , it &apos;s just that .
stalling is not tolerated .
we &apos;re doing the best we can , all right ?
why isn &apos;t the power back on ?
where &apos;s my armored vehicle ?
we &apos;re working on it .
work harder .
if the power isn &apos;t back in 60 seconds ,
i &apos;m gonna start shooting people .
your time starts now .
give him the power .
he &apos;s bluffing .
i can &apos;t take that chance .
restore the power .
counselor ?
the least of your many talents , my friend .
he just looked right at me . it &apos;s him . it &apos;s reddington .
that &apos;s reddington .
he called the tip in on himself .
this whole thing , he wanted us to --
breach ! breach now !
okay , everyone , let &apos;s pack it up .
i &apos;m sorry you have to burn this operation
on our account , chui . it was a beautiful thing .
if only it lasted .
they &apos;ll be packed and long gone
before the f.b.i. ever gets down here .
this way .
let &apos;s go ! go !
kitchen ! kitchen !
they &apos;re not here .
hell .
get these people out of here .
they didn &apos;t just disappear . there &apos;s gotta be a way out .
break down every wall if you have to .
find them .
this is a bad situation , red .
they will hunt me , and they will find me .
and when they do , do you know where i am going ?
in a hole .
do you like tahiti ?
solitary . 23 hours a day .
there will be no parole
and no chance of seeing becky again , that &apos;s for sure .
you &apos;re a free man , marvin .
instead of facing a notoriously unpredictable parole board
and the showering with the boys ,
you &apos;ll be unwinding on a small banana plantation
i have outside of papeete .
becky .
get in the car , marvin .
have a mai tai , soak up some sun
because i &apos;ll be contacting you soon , and when i do ,
i want this plan of yours to be thoroughly mapped out .
we only have one shot at this .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
make sure you have heia air dry your sheets !
you &apos;ll sleep like a baby !
this whole thing , the diner ,
it wasn &apos;t a hostage situation . it was a jail break .
yes .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to fight our way out of this , lizzy .
we &apos;re gonna have to think our way out .
you really think he can help ?
i do .
where do we go from here ?
the owner &apos;s gone , the lawyer &apos;s gone ,
and red and liz are gone .
why would he go to all this trouble ,
risk everything , just to free marvin gerard ?
put the word out .
they &apos;re in the wind , and we &apos;re back to square one .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve offered chui
to divulge the secret of this recipe .
he won &apos;t say .
i suspect it has something to do with how he beats his eggs .
i cannot stop thinking about that man from the diner ...
i wonder if he uses a whisk .
his wife , the way she looked at me .
no one &apos;s ever looked at me like that before .
how do you do it ?
do what ?
how do you deal with people looking at you that way ?
the fear ?
how do you go on knowing that people are terrified of you ?
from as early as i can remember ,
i dreamed of someday being captain of a ship .
to be out there on the ocean in the middle of the night ,
navigating by the stars .
i always thought it would be the greatest life on earth .
the people you &apos;re talking about ...
the ones who think they know you ...
they really don &apos;t know anything about you at all .
i &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
about a life at sea .
why didn &apos;t you do it ?
you went into naval intelligence instead .
it was the cold war . there were spies to run .
the cabal-- they blamed you for something you hadn &apos;t done .
sailors have been navigating by the stars ...
for thousands of years .
odysseus spent a decade at war ...
曾参加特洛伊战争
but his biggest battle was finding his way home .
i think you would &apos;ve made a terrific captain .
i don &apos;t know .
you can &apos;t do every silly thing you want to in life .
you have to make your choices .
you have to try to be happy with them .
i think we &apos;ve done pretty well .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy to ignore
the way people look at you .
but i hope you can find some solace
in the fact that when i look at you ...
♬ i &apos;ll light the fire ♬
♬ you place the flowers ♬
♬ in the vase that you bought ♬
♬ today ♬
♬ staring at the fire ♬
♬ for hours and hours ♬
♬ while i listen to you ♬
♬ play your love songs ♬
♬ all night long ♬
♬ oh , such a cozy room ♬
♬ the windows are illuminated ♬
♬ by the evening sunshine ... ♬
that &apos;s polaris , the north star .
♬ fiery gems ... ♬
that &apos;s how sailors used to find their way home .
♬ only for you ♬
when i look at you , that &apos;s what i see .
i see my way home .
♬ our house ♬
♬ is a very , very , very fine house ♬

♬ life used to be so hard ♬

i &apos;m a man of my word .
your granddaughter got the antidote .
now it &apos;s your turn .
we lost your boss ,
and no one seems to know where he &apos;s gone .
but i have the sneaking suspicion ...
that you do .
so ...
where is raymond reddington ?
we need to talk .
