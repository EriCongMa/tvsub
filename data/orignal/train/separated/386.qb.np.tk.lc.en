新喷的漆 新轮胎 不赖吧
你想试驾一下吗
that &apos;s a 2.4 liter 6 cylinder engine .
with hitachi sidedraft carbs .
that &apos;s right .
wanna take a look under the hood ?
yeah !
you know your z. i &apos;m impressed .
you should have your mechanic check it out anyway .
thank you .
so it &apos;s just ... right up here .
what are you doing ?
okay .
stop the car now .
pull over now !
let &apos;s call him ... sergio .
ha ha ! please tell me you &apos;re kidding .
it &apos;s hebrew . look what it means .
it &apos;s perfect . gideon hotchner .
the winners sit . losers , drink .
cheers .
trust me ... we cover the whole spectrum of psychos .
we do terrorists , arsonists--
excuse me .
were you with him in boston ?
i was supposed to be .
yeah . this is morgan .
anyone recognize these faces ?
victims of the footpath killer .
&#91; 联邦调查局 弗吉尼亚州 匡提科 &#93;
i told virginia p.d ...
works a menial job .
where &apos;d the murders occur ?
hiking paths . isolated .
even out in the middle of nowhere ,
i lack confidence .
like ted bundy did .
excuse me .
seattle &apos;s hit a wall ?
and another girl is missing .
you &apos;re gonna be with us in seattle asap .
22 @-@ year @-@ old heather woodland .
they want you back in the saddle .
you ready ?
looks like medical leave &apos;s over , boss .
they sure they want me ?
the order came from the director .
well , we &apos;d better get started .
joseph conrad said ,
we want an assessment .
are we clear ?
of course .
he stabbed her ...
so he stabbed her instead .
becoming a better killer .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry !
&#91; 华盛顿州 西雅图市 &#93;
he never stands with his back to a window .
morgan , it &apos;s been 6 months . everything &apos;s ok .
this is special agent gideon ,
special agent reid .
dr. reid .
dr. reid , our expert on ... well , everything .
i hope you all remember me .
he &apos;s willing to travel with the body .
on purpose .
so you wanna see our suspect list ?
it keeps our perspective unbiased .
agent gideon , where would you like to start ?
let &apos;s start at the site of the last murder .
the one who caught that guy , adrian baal , in boston .
nails clipped just like the others .
he wants them to fight back .
but not enough to hurt him .
and he left the belt around her neck .
he &apos;s probably in his early 20 &apos;s .
what &apos;s your reasoning ?
youthful arrogance .
he clothed the body before dumping it .
that &apos;s a sign of remorse .
it &apos;s not consistent . look where we are .
they &apos;re disposable .
it &apos;s what we call the reid effect .
happens with children , too .
you look too young to have gone to medical school .
they &apos;re phd &apos;s . 3 of them .
are you a genius or something ?
i don &apos;t believe that intelligence can be accurately quantified--
yes , i &apos;m a genius .
sandy , you get a lot of attention , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , heather loves this dog .
not sense . smell .
sandy &apos;s worried because she knows you are .
david , does your sister drive a datsun z ?
come on , sandy .
if i want to coax a young woman into my car ...
offer her a test drive .
but the autopsy protocol says what ?
he doesn &apos;t want &apos; em looking at him , apparently .
all right , enough .
let &apos;s tell them we &apos;re ready .
we &apos;re ready ?
reid . you &apos;re good with this ?
we &apos;ve got a woman who &apos;s only got a few hours left to live ,
they don &apos;t call them nervous breakdowns anymore .
he &apos;s someone you wouldn &apos;t notice at first .
he &apos;s someone who &apos;d blend into any crowd .
petty crimes . maybe auto theft .
psychopathic as opposed to psychotic .
he follows the news , has good hygiene . he &apos;s smart .
the murders have all involved rapes .
and that tells us he &apos;s sexually inadequate .
psychiatric evaluations will show a history of paranoia
stemming from a childhood trauma--
death of a parent or family member .
and now he feels persecuted and watched .
murder gives him a sense of power .
organized killers have a fascination with law enforcement .
they will inject themselves into the investigation .
that makes them feel powerful , in control .
which is why i also think ...
hi . i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
and the lights weren &apos;t working .
richard . richard , get down here !
hello ?
you are under arrest for the murder ...
emerson said ,
is another riddle . &quot;
but we won &apos;t be able to hold him .
slessman &apos;s been at the top of the suspect list .
is that the mother ?
grandmother . the mother died in a fire when he was 13 .
probably not the only fire in his childhood .
exactly how much is a multitude ?
luring him out was your idea , right ? greenway ?
hotch says your background is in sex offender cases .
what can you tell us ?
he &apos;ll keep a victim for a couple of days .
you ok with hotch being in on the interview ?
slessman &apos;s done time , and he knows the process .
and all you will get now is a demand for a lawyer .
next time , show a little leg .
seriously ... i want that opening at bau .
we &apos;re missin &apos; something .
something &apos;s not right about this .
this is a boy &apos;s room ... not a man &apos;s .
log in password .
no , no-- wait , wait !
it was a false password .
chairman mao required his generals to learn it .
it also looks like he &apos;s playing himself .
how can you tell ?
this might provide an advantage , actually .
there are profiles for every player
the conservative point counter , the aggressor , the finesser .
what kind of player is slessman ?
extreme aggressor .
okay , here we go .
what &apos;s the number 6 at the bottom of the screen ?
there could be an email , or a journal in the computer
something that tells us where heather is .
do you think you can break in ?
in 6 tries ?
try not.do or do not .
yoda .
i wanna talk to him .
you read my paper . learn anything ?
you said he was lying ,
you have an academic interest in disassociative identity disorder ,
or you just planning your defense ?
you a fan of adrian baal &apos;s work ?
no .
i &apos;m a fan of yours .
you know ...
they never give you the real facts about cpr ...
that outside of a hospital , it &apos;s only effective 7 % of the time .
your friend had a 93 % certainty of dying ,
but you kept trying ... even after you &apos;d broken his ribs ,
why don &apos;t you tell us where heather woodland is ?
woodland ...
isn &apos;t she the girl that went missing a couple days ago ?
get him out of here .
he is &quot; isn &apos;t she the girl ... &quot;
she &apos;s alive . we don &apos;t know for how long .
what is it ?
conflicts in the profile .
there &apos;s a second killer .
a second unsub .
its &apos; not unusual .
1979 . they outfitted a van to rape
they &apos;re not equals .
slessman &apos;s smart , but he is a submissive personality .
probably not as smart as slessman .
he &apos;s like the schoolyard bully recruiting a good underling
he &apos;ll be protective of richard .
he &apos;ll make him feel like he owes him .
this guy showed him how to do it .
he helped him take the first step .
no , no . we need leverage .
that &apos;ll take too long . there &apos;s gotta be a faster way .
there is .
here . this might be a little hot .
mrs. slessman , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got the right guy .
there &apos;s gotta be someone .
hey , it &apos;s morgan . need you to work me some magic here .
i got a program called deadbolt defense
and a girl with only a couple of hours to live ,
deadbolt &apos;s the number one password crack @-@ resistant software out there .
you &apos;re gonna have to get inside this guy &apos;s head to get the password .
i thought i was calling the office of supreme genius .
well , gorgeous , you &apos;ve been rerouted to the office of too friggin &apos; bad .
thanks anyway .
well , there was ... there was this one young man .
i think his name was charlie .
cross @-@ reference charlie for the second unsub .
charlie is probably charles linder .
he was slessman &apos;s cellmate and ...
received a dishonorable discharge from the military .
my name is richard slessman , and i have trouble sleeping .
okay , what do i do when i &apos;m trying to get to sleep ?
guys , a little help .
does senior management want a field assessment on gideon ?
what &apos;s the address ?
don &apos;t think it matters anymore .
winston churchill said ,
anyone who can tell us more about slessman ?
car accident , 2 months ago .
linder is dead .
too bad you guys came here for nothing .
i mean , talk about scum .
you protect them ?
if you &apos;re a little white guy ?
especially in a prison like this .
oh , yeah .
thanks for your help .
what &apos;s he doing ?
and i want you to write the name on the sides .
whose name ?
4 months of investigative work , 1 file ,
and guess what , richard .
it &apos;s not your file . see , we don &apos;t care about you .
it &apos;s vogel we want .
oh , come on ! i need a password . i need a password .
think we may have missed the obvious .
what are you doing ?
reid , what made you think of this ?
it was the only empty case .
what song could possibly speak to me ?
&quot; enter sandman . &quot;
and it &apos;s so powerful that we &apos;ll ...
and you need to protect him .
guys like vogel learn in the schoolyard
which kids to bully and which kids to protect ,
that you &apos;ll go to jail for him .
richard , i &apos;m here to remind you something .
you owe him nothing .
there &apos;s something wrong .
we gotta pull him over . i can feel it .
impatient .
you wanna stop him , you give me a reason .
he &apos;s slowing at yellow lights .
this is not someone who is rushing to kill and dump a body .
okay . do it .
get out !
what are you doin &apos; driving his car ? !
he asked if he could borrow my truck .
&apos;cause we &apos;re watching her right now .
yeah .
right there .
yeah , what about it ?
like the earth is tilting .
not the earth , doc . the ocean .
she &apos;s on a boat ? where ?
it &apos;s a pier or a dock .
he wouldn &apos;t be able to transmit the webcam image from the middle of the ocean .
what is it you always ask garcia ?
to work me a little magic .
and vogel &apos;s nailing you to the wall .
yeah , whatever .
he &apos;s talking , richard .
reciprocity .
is it a dock ?
a pier ?
it &apos;s a shipyard .
allied shipyard .
reid , he &apos;s inside .
get elle on the phone .
you told me to trust my instincts .
stop !
get ... back !
shoot me instead .
come on . what , are you a lousy shot ?
i know all about ya , tim .
it is physical .
what did the girls call you in high school ?
i got it . tiny tim .
gideon !
go look after the girl .
so what kind of report do they want on him ?
guess what gideon means in hebrew .
mighty warrior .
appropriate .
what would you say ?
gideon saved her life .
that &apos;s good enough for me .
you and haley pick the baby &apos;s name yet ?
it &apos;s funny ... haley liked the name charles ,
there &apos;s just too many of them .
how &apos;s your report going ?
you know , you saved that girl today .
it &apos;s a good thing .
nietzsche once said ,
the abyss looks into you . &quot;
i &apos;ll take this .
have a n @-@ i-- n @-@ nice day .
