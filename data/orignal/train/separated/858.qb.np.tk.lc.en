back in the &apos; 80s , you had cars that could travel through time ,
cars that caught ghosts , and cars that could talk to david hasselhoff .
so when my brother barry got his icense ...
he was finally free !
unfortunately , with my mom ,
you &apos;re never free .
tush inside . now .
what the hell ?
are you just sitting back there waiting for me ?
yes . tush !
rule number seven--
total focus on the road .
no eating , no passengers , no music .
what ?
no music .
rule number eight--
doors must be locked and windows rolled up at all times .
all times .
that &apos;s insane !
which brings us to number nine-- you only drive in safe areas .
that means ...
stay within the green zone .
you got a map with plastic overlays ?
who does that ?
i do .
and rule number ten ,
and this is the most important rule--
call me when you get there .
always call me when you get there .
why do i have to call you when i get there ?
i &apos;m there . i know i &apos;m there .
but i don &apos;t know . for all i know ,
you could be stranded in the middle of nowhere ,
lying facedown in a ditch .
do the dishes , damn it !
ditches , okay ? !
you &apos;re just blindly agreeing with her
and have no idea what she &apos;s even talking about .
i know what she &apos;s talking about .
right there . learn your state capitals .
but you &apos;re too much of a big shot to study .
let me tell you somethin &apos; , mister .
college is right around the corner ,
and you need to shape up or ship out .
we &apos;re talking about her stupid driving rules , dad .
can you stick up for me here ? for once ? please ?
and for the first time ,
my father actually took my brother &apos;s side .
no .
no , wait . that never happened .
the amount of suck
in this room is unreal !
i &apos;m going to the movies .
call me when you get there !
but out of principle ,
barry did no call when he got there
because he knew that out in the world ,
he was beyond my mother &apos;s reach .
barry goldberg ?
is there a barry goldberg here ?
barry goldberg ?
um , yeah ?
you need to call your mother
and tell her you arrived here safely .
she &apos;s very worried , dude . not cool .
it was october 18th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my sister and i were watching
the most entertaining thing we &apos;d ever seen--
my dad trying to work the vcr .
every time it ended like this .
the damn thing &apos;s broken !
it &apos;s not broken . just let me do it .
no !
i &apos;m tired of coming to you for this
every single time i work late .
all right ? gotta do it myself .
&quot; teach a man to fish . &quot; you ever heard that saying ?
you promised to teach me to fish two birthdays ago .
stop aggravating me ! this is important !
the phillies are in the world series !
it might be another century before this happens again .
dad , you &apos;ve been messing with that for ten minutes .
just let adam do it .
no .
just give me the remote . give me the remote .
here . let me do this .
the hell ?
it &apos;s covered in buttons ! covered !
don &apos;t bother with the buttons . use the voice command .
right , erica ?
right . um , it &apos;s new .
just hold the remote and speak into the top .
record world series .
nothing .
get your lips closer , dad .
oh , i see . r @-@ right there .
record .
record .
nothing !
it &apos;s not identifying your voice . you gotta say your name .
my name is ...
murray ...
goldberg !
like it understands him .
all right . just record the damn game .
where is she ?
where &apos;s the woman who gave me life and nothing more , huh ?
whoa , whoa , stop . i &apos;ve been waiting for you ,
and we need to talk .
busy . i gotta call mom .
um , no . you &apos;re coming with me .
leave me alone , or so help me god--
why &apos;d you have to purple my nurple ?
this doesn &apos;t involve you .
of course it does !
mom was freaking out all day
because you didn &apos;t call her when you got there .
and when she goes into worry mode ,
she tightens the clamps on me , too .
you almost blew my whole system .
what system ?
the system where i ignore all of her driving rules
and get away with it .
proceed .
last week , i went to study at lainey &apos;s house two blocks away ,
and as always , i called when i got there .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here , mom .
we &apos;re playing def leppard records
and making jiffy pop . miss you . &quot;
so ?
so ... i was at a def leppard concert ...
in new jersey .
jersey ? that &apos;s the red zone .
damn right it is .
studying with lainey was my cover story .
you got a good cover story ,
and you can do anything you want .
i &apos;ve even been to manhattan .
the black zone .
and tomorrow night , guess where i &apos;m going .
kegger in the woods .
whoa ! that &apos;s supposed to be the best party of the year .
and my cover story ...
band practice .
i haven &apos;t played violin since eighth grade ,
but she doesn &apos;t know that .
no way . can i join your band ?
i have an electric keyboard in my closet .
get your own thing , idiot .
your loss .
it has over 70 rhythm settings .
has samba , bossa nova , rap ,
has rock 1 , has rock 2--
stop ! it &apos;s not a real band , and even if it was ,
you suck at keyboard .
you suck at everything !
but thanks for the help .
there are my boys !
how was tennis ?
excellent . once again ,
the lad and i trounced the ferguson sisters .
well , i 40 @-@ love you both .
please don &apos;t .
well , come sit . you &apos;ve earned yourselves a victory dinner .
i can only stay a few minutes .
i got a date with one of the sisters .
which one again ?
miriam .
she &apos;s the sexy one , right ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t see what you see .
oh , dad , before you go , i bought you something .
life alert-- &quot; as seen on tv . &quot;
back in the day ,
commercials were simple and to the point ,
especially this classic ...
i &apos;ve fallen , and i can &apos;t get up !
why is no one helping her ?
help her !
we &apos;re sending help immediately , mrs. fletcher .
oh , good , they &apos;re coming .
are you kidding me ?
why don &apos;t you get me a sweatshirt
which says &quot; i &apos;m old &quot;
and send me out to the duck pond to feed the ducks ?
dad , you live alone .
what happens if you fall and you can &apos;t get up ?
in my whole life ,
i &apos;ve never once tripped , slipped , or fallen .
yeah ! this is an insult !
i &apos;m rock solid . go ahead .
sock me in the kidney . do it .
go ahead , mom . hit grandpa .
do it .
i &apos;m not punching you in the kidney , dad .
you don &apos;t want it ? fine . be a burden on your family .
i will .
he will .
while my mom had her own strategy to get her way ,
barry was gonna use erica &apos;s strategy to get his .
just say what i told you to say .
don &apos;t add anything and don &apos;t embellish .
hey , ma . listen ,
i &apos;ve been thinking , and i wanted to say how sorry i am
for not calling you from the theater .
well , thank you . that &apos;s very mature of you .
i appreciate it .
and i appreciate you .
i know i don &apos;t say it enough ,
but ... i love you , girl .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
you &apos;re gonna get some extra stir @-@ fry tonight .
oh , i almost forgot .
can i go to roger mcfadden &apos;s house tomorrow night ?
i love roger mcfadden .
i know you do . that &apos;s why i chose him ...
to teach me spanish .
we have a quiz .
i &apos;ll be home at 10 : 00,
which is rule four , if i recall .
and don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll follow all the other rules , too .
that sounds muy bueno .
roger will cover that with you .
this speech is my recital
i think it &apos;s very vital
to rock a rhyme , that &apos;s right on time
it &apos;s tricky is the title , here we go ...
it &apos;s tricky to rock a rhyme , to rock a rhyme
that &apos;s right on time , it &apos;s tricky
it &apos;s tricky , tricky , tricky ,
it &apos;s tricky to rock a rhyme , to rock a rhyme
that &apos;s right on time , it &apos;s tricky
tricky , tricky , tricky , tricky
my god . look who made it out of the green zone .
all thanks to you .
now point me to the phone and we &apos;re good to go .
what are you talking about ?
gotta call mom ,
tell her i arrived safely at &quot; roger mcfadden &apos;s house . &quot;
there &apos;s no phone here .
it &apos;s the kegger in the woods . the woods ?
well ... there &apos;s gotta be a house here somewhere .
i mean , a lumberjack &apos;s camp . a ranger &apos;s station .
a secret army base .
how deep in the woods do you think we are ?
i don &apos;t know . this is the orange zone .
i &apos;ve never gone this far .
calm down .
you told roger mcfadden all about this , right ?
no . roger went down the shore with his family .
you need him to cover for you
in case mom calls his house .
what do you think &quot; cover story &quot; means ?
it means someone to cover for you !
you wanted other people involved ?
this is too complicated for me !
you should have just let me join your band !
dumbass , you &apos;re gonna ruin this for the both of us !
get in your car and drive to a phone now .
gotta call my mom , gotta call mom .
oh , no , no , no .
damn it !
i gotta call my mom !
erica ! help me !
let &apos;s go over there .
damn it .
why ? !
i gotta call my mom ! i gotta call my mom !
i gotta call my mom !
i &apos;m home !
back before e @-@ mails , texts , and tweets ,
you could go a whole day without spoilers
or knowing the score of a game ,
and now my dad was finally gonna get to watch
the most important phillies game of his lifetime .
all right .
howard cosell , give me the sweet stuff .
murray , turn that tv off !
or not .
oh , god .
barry hasn &apos;t called . he &apos;s been gone almost an hour .
i called roger mcfadden &apos;s house .
no one &apos;s answering .
how many times have you called ?
eight .
when you hit 15 , then we &apos;ll talk .
so you &apos;re just gonna sit here and watch a baseball game
when our son might be laying facedown
in a ditch somewhere .
might be . but might not be .
the only thing we know for sure
is i &apos;m watching the world series .
how do you sleep at night ?
not as good as i do during the day , but not bad .
relax . kid &apos;s gonna be fine .
but he wasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s okay . i can fix this .
okay . all right .
no !
mom !
i &apos;m at roger &apos;s house !
i got here safely !
i love ...
while barry &apos;s night was off and running ,
my grandfather &apos;s was just winding down .
yeah , i &apos;d love for you to stay the night , but , uh ...
turns out i got a meeting first thing in the morning .
well , i thought you retired ten years ago .
yeah , well , i still do part @-@ time consulting
and the occasional--
do you need money for a cab ?
what &apos;s this ?
this is one of those things from the commercial .
well , you don &apos;t wear one of these ?
no , no . this is just , uh , it &apos;s a gag gift
from some of the guys down at the boxing club , and ...
hilarious .
well , this has been fun . i &apos;ll call you .
uh ... no .
i &apos;ll call you . i @-@ i do the calling .
unbelievable .
son of a bitch !
yes , i &apos;m calling to see if my son
might have been brought into your emergency room
earlier tonight .
uh , he is 5 &apos; 8 , &quot; dark hair , fair skin ,
beautiful brown eyes .
oh , he was just the sweetest little baby you &apos;ve ever seen .
what ? no .
okay , thank you .
what is that pitch ? ! that &apos;s garbage !
i hate you , dickie noles !
okay . he &apos;s not in the emergency room
or the police station
or the roller rink or the batting cages
or any of the four ice cream shops
in the green zone , and i have failed as a mother .
you &apos;re good at other things .
barry !
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s just me , darling .
your line &apos;s been busy for quite a while now , and i--
can &apos;t talk now !
damn it !
i can &apos;t take it anymore . go out and find our baby , murray .
please ! if i go out , i &apos;ll find out what happened in the game !
enough with the baseball . what is wrong with you ?
why aren &apos;t you worried ? he &apos;s out there .
he could be injured , or cold or hungry .
what if he has to make ? he doesn &apos;t use public bathrooms !
bevy , calm down , okay ?
every time our kids leave the house ,
you assume that they &apos;re dead until they prove otherwise .
know that they &apos;re smart , responsible kids .
assume that they &apos;re alive .
that &apos;s the stupidest thing you &apos;ve ever said !
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
barry ?
no , it &apos;s not barry . it &apos;s me . put adam on the phone .
adam , get in here , talk to your grandfather
so he &apos;ll stop tying up the line !
make it quick .
yeah , pops ?
while pops was looking for a little help ,
my dad was out looking for barry ,
and he was growing increasingly worried
that he &apos;d find out what happened in the game .
quite an emotional night for phillies fans ...
if my dad didn &apos;t find barry soon ,
my brother was gonna pay .
excuse me , officer .
did you see a high school kid driving around here ?
curly hair , kind of lumpy ?
no , but there &apos;s a party in the woods
down by alverthorpe park .
okay .
hey , phillies ! man , how about--
no , no , no !
i just wanna watch the world series !
i &apos;m gonna kill that kid !
pops ? pops !
over here !
what happened ?
i have fallen ...
and i ... cannot get up .
there you go .
easy . little more .
pull your robe down .
it &apos;s a kimono .
pull your kimono down .
it &apos;s designed to be showy .
well , it &apos;s working .
just don &apos;t look down !
what did i just see ? it was like a robin &apos;s nest !
it &apos;s an unflattering angle .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
stop looking down and get me to the couch already !
oh ! okay .
you good ?
yeah , okay . i &apos;m--i &apos;m good now .
thanks for dropping by , kid .
are you sure you &apos;re good ?
of course . like you even need to ask .
it &apos;s just that you said that you never fell before .
i threw my back out . it could happen to anyone .
so what do you wanna do with this ?
chuck it !
i get it . this thing might be embarrassing ,
but ... no more embarrassing than that robe .
for the second time that night ,
i saw a part of my grandfather i &apos;d never seen before--
the part that was actually vulnerable .
stop ! stop ! please !
stop ! sto--uhh !
stop ! stop !
i need your c.b. radio to call my mom
so she knows i &apos;m safe !
no , no , no , no !
my dad had spent the last hour driving all over town .
just as he was starting to think
my mom &apos;s craziness may not have been so crazy ,
he spotted a familiar jacket ...
oh . hi .
and a familiar jackass .
you couldn &apos;t have been sitting up in a ditch ?
or reclining comfortably in a ditch ?
no , you had to be facedown , exactly like she said !
and to think i told your mom you could be trusted ,
mostly &apos; cause i wanted to watch the game .
but you know what ? a small part of me
actually thought , &quot; hey , he &apos;s not a complete moron . &quot;
only some of this happened &apos; cause i &apos;m a complete moron .
the rest is &apos; cause of mom &apos;s stupid rules .
hey , her rules are there to protect you .
i almost died when i saw your jacket in the road .
you worry about me , too ?
oh , don &apos;t put words in my mouth .
of course i do .
your mom can &apos;t know anything about this .
what ? you &apos;re gonna lie to mom ?
absolutely ! she finds out about this ,
you &apos;re not gonna be allowed to leave the house
until you &apos;re 40 , and then my life is ruined , too !
nice ! i &apos;m off the hook , then .
you are so grounded . secretly , though .
you will choose to stay in every weekend
for the next three months , and for the love of god ,
when i do let you back out in the world ,
you will call me when you get there .
i will . i promise .
i was throwing that for a friend .
and tell your stupid sister that she &apos;s secretly grounded , too .
thanks for being so cool about this .
i thought you &apos;d be in the worst mood
after the phillies lost .
get out .
lie down .
i &apos;m gonna run you over .
and so my brother crammed three months of partying
into one epic night of awesome .
as for pops ,
he was starting to realize it wasn &apos;t so bad
to give up a piece of his freedom
for his family &apos;s peace of mind .
still got it .
so he &apos;s waiting for the tow truck ,
he stays in the car , rule number three ...
ultimately it wasn &apos;t my mom &apos;s elaborate rules
that put her at ease ...
and listen to this .
he &apos;s over at roger mcfadden &apos;s studying right now ...
it was my dad &apos;s elaborate lies .
he is such a great kid .
knowing it was their last night of freedom ,
barry and erica made every moment count ...
and it was glorious ...
until the cops raided the place five minutes later .
that &apos;s a new &quot; knight rider &quot; on tonight .
mind if i tape it ?
no ! um , as a matter of fact ,
why don &apos;t you use , uh , the new voice command ?
for real ?
yeah , for real . tell it your name .
hi . i &apos;m barry goldberg .
now , uh , tell it to do something .
remote , turn to &quot; knight rider . &quot;
that &apos;s pretty cool .
wait a minute . did it ? give it to me a second here .
uh ... go back to &quot; t.j. hooker . &quot;
no , wrong way !
&quot; t.j. hooker &quot; ! tell it to go back to &quot; t.j. hooker . &quot;
no , you tell it .
all right , remote , this is murray ... goldberg .
please go back to &quot; t.j. hooker . &quot;
no !
wrong way !
you know &quot; t.j. hooker , &quot; with william shatner .
and he fell for it again .
hooker ! t.j. !
i want you to get away from there .
i can &apos;t see , and it &apos;s very annoying .
is it annoying ?
give me that .
whoa . no .
i want that camera . i &apos;m gonna take it and break it !
