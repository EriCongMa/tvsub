Killing me is gonna take a lot more than that, dearie.
Hook.
Captain hook?
We destroyed the wardrobe.
No!
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
There's an enchanted compass. Cora seeks it.
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Your longest stint anywhere was two years.
What did you enjoy so much about Tallahassee?
It's poison.
I love you, Henry.
You saved me.
It's a little freakier than I remember from the story.
Reminds me of death.
Encouraging.
Well, your compass awaits.
Shall we?
Wait. If these beans...
create...
portals,
why not just pick one and go home?
Why the compass?
Because there aren't any more beans.
Whatever story you think you know, my dear,
is most certainly wrong.
There was a guy named Jack and a cow
and something about an evil giant with a treasure
and a golden goose.
Or harp.
Sounds like a lovely tale,
but the truth's a little bit more gruesome.
The giants grew the beans,
but rather than use them for good,
they used them to plunder all the lands.
Jack was a man who fought a terrible war,
defeating all but one of the evil giants.
The beans were destroyed by the giants as they died.
If they couldn't have their magic, then nobody could.
It's really very bad form.
Evil giants who made magic portal beans?
Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?
Because one giant survived--
the strongest and most terrible of them all.
And we'll have to get past him to--
The magic compass.
Indeed.
The treasure remains,
and amongst it is the compass.
Now it will guide us to your land.
Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes,
but she can't find your land without the compass.
Once we get it,
steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way.
How do we know you're not just using us
to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
All I need is a ride back.
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
Then we'd better start climbing.
Right. So...
I failed to mention that
the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders.
All right, so how do we get up there?
I've got a counter spell from Cora,
if you'd be so kind.
Thank you, my lady.
I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
So...
which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?
Go on. Fight it out.
Don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it.
Impressive.
But really, you could've just asked me for the keys.
Just drive. It's fine.
I just stole your car. Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
Yeah, I'm not telling you my name.
No, I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery's in progress.
Emma. Swan.
Good name.
So do you just live in here,
or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
Excuse me?
Hey. Eyes on the road.
I am not having drinks with you. You might be a pervert.
I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief.
I said I was sorry.
You didn't, actually.
Damn it.
That's why I said, "Eyes on the road."
Screwdriver.
License and registration.
Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car.
I'm--I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
But, you know... women.
All right, I hear you.
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah. Thank you so much.
What are you, some sort of a misogynist?
You're welcome.
Oh, go. We got lucky.
"We"?
This isn't your car either, is it?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go.
How many wars have you been through?
My share.
It should be me.
You? You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
Why would you--
Because I have no loved ones.
If I fail, you can still go on.
It's me. I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail.
You're new here.
It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Come with me.
This...
powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
Your sword-- how strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
Give me ten hours.
If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going.
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
If I don't get back, you get her home.
Ladies.
In this world, we are slaves to time.
And ours is running out.
In other words, ticktock.
I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
That's a good girl.
This will allow you to climb. There are other dangers.
Thankfully, you've got me to protect you.
I can't climb one-handed, can I?
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
First beanstalk?
Well, you never forget your first.
You know,
most men would take your silence as off-putting,
but I love a challenge.
I'm concentrating.
No, you're afraid.
Afraid to talk,
to reveal yourself,
to trust me.
Things'll be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
The pirate thing.
Well, I don't need you to share.
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite. Let's see.
You volunteered to come up here
because you were the most motivated.
You need to get back to a child.
That's not perception. That's eavesdropping.
Ah, but you don't want to abandon him
the way you were abandoned.
Was I?
Like I said,
an open book.
How would you know that?
I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys.
They all share the same look in their eyes--
The look you get when you've been left alone.
Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland.
But an orphan's an orphan.
Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?
You ever even been in love?
No. I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie.
I'm gonna get directions.
I will.
Hey, man. How are you?
I've been better.
Listen, my wife and I...
are really lost.
I'm trying to get to Eugene,
and I think we've been going the wrong way.
Can you show me what's going on here?
Where are we, first of all?
Okay, wait. Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map? Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay. Now your problem is...
Is you're way up here. You see that?
Oh, my god. That is a problem.
Yeah.
Now what you wanna do...
You have to take 5 all the way south towards Salem.
That's right down there. You see that?
Okay.
That's where you're going. You got it?
Hey, mister, that guy's stealing that--
Oh, god! Oh, god.
Honey?
Oh. Oh. I think--
I think it's time.
He's ready?
Oh, yeah.
You didn't see him take the--
Oh! Oh! It hurts really bad!
Do you guys need help?
No, no, mister, you didn't see--
Oh, my god!
It hurts really bad!
Okay. Okay.
You want me to call an ambulance?
No, it's fine!
My car's out front.
I know, I know. Breathe, baby.
Oh! Oh! Oh, god.
Breathe! Let's go! Come on.
Oh! Oh, god!
You know they were stealing.
The little guy saved us.
He sure did!
The miracle of birth!
Good haul.
Thanks.
I got you a key chain.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Okay. We gotta go.
All right, come on, kids.
20 minutes till housekeeping.
You wanna shower first?
Oh, look. The granola family left this.
What is that?
It's a native american dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out
and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Let's keep it.
Yeah. Hang it where? The car?
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying--
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think-- I think it's time.
Together?
Don't you wanna?
Like where? Neverland?
I'm serious. We could do this.
Where?
Where? I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick--
That's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
Yeah, it's Florida. Everything's near a beach.
Okay, then Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure? Is this...
What you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches, take turns sleeping.
We'll most likely have to walk through the night again,
so we should rest while we can.
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares.
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm. I had them for months.
Charming--my husband--
He used to wake me,
when I cried out, he'd light a candle.
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Why don't you try... to sleep?
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.
What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand--it's cut. Let me help you.
No. No. It's fine.
No, it's not.
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
Giants can smell blood,
and I'm always a gentleman.
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
A bloody waste of it.
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave.
It's where the treasures are,
where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder mulan gave us-- we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
Well, that's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
Ooh, you're a tough lass.
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?
That's why you want to kill him.
For someone who's never been in love,
you're quite perceptive, aren't you?
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
No, no. Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix--
This high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
He would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches.
Neal--
I resisted twice.
The third time, this guy's asking to get took.
So I-I grabbed a couple cases of watches
and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.
Anyway, I stashed 'em in a locker at the train station.
They're still there.
It's hardly stealing.
So you got away clean.
I didn't get away clean.
The manager may have been a drunk,
but the security cameras are stone sober.
I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't.
I'm sorry. Tallahassee's out.
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
If I get caught, and you're with me,
you're in trouble--
You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that? You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake ID and passports.
Those cost money. We have a stolen car.
We make it legit.
We take a V.I.N. Number off of another car.
Emma, I'm not gonna have you in the seat next to me
with $20,000-- wait. Wait. Seriously, wait. Wait. Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me. We can--we can fence them
and then we have the money. We can do whatever we want.
We can go wherever we want, right?
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you--you want to steal the watches
to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything--
I love you.
I love you, too.
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
Oh, damn it.
You big git!
Yeah, you. Huh?
You wanna kill a human?
Huh? You want to kill a human?
I'm the worst human around. Come on!
Come on then!
Come on then!
Hook?
Hook!
He's out cold.
I don't mean to upset you, Emma,
but I think we make quite the team.
Let's go steal a compass.
Hey. Aurora?
It was just a dream.
It was just a dream.
It was horrible.
Why don't you tell me about it? Do you want to tell me about it?
Come on. Let's stand. Tell me.
It was the same as last time.
I was in this room-- this--this red room.
It was bright. Blood-red curtains.
There was no windows or doors so it didn't make sense,
and I couldn't get in or out. I was trapped.
The curtains-- they were on fire.
It was horrible.
It's okay.
I was hunched in a corner,
and I looked over into the other corner.
In the shadows, there was someone else there.
I just see his eyes. He was looking right at me.
It's okay.
It's over now.
These nightmares--
they will fade away. I promise.
Did they for you?
Yeah. Come on.
Come on.
I'll sit with you until you fall back asleep.
Who else do I have to take care of?
They hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here--
piles of jewels,
and every room filled with coins.
Let's get to it. The compass.
What's your rush?
How long do you think magic knockout powder lasts?
I have no clue.
That's my rush.
Too right, lass.
Come. Everything we need is right in front of us.
Train 643 with stops in Cleveland,
D.C., and Seattle.
Now boarding on track...
They kill all the giant housekeepers, too?
How we're gonna find a compass in this mess?
By looking.
Start searching.
I wonder how much treasure we could carry down the beanstalk.
In addition to the compass, of course.
What the hell?
That... would be Jack.
As in Jack--
The giant killer.
With that toothpick?
Well, it packs quite a wallop. You'd be surprised.
It's about bloody time.
It's a trip wire.
Quite a security system.
Well, that's a plausible excuse for grabbing me,
but next time, don't stand on ceremony.
Let's find the compass
and go home.
After you.
Oh, thank god.
Let's see 'em.
That's not as many as I thought.
Yeah, but they're super pricey.
This is $20,000 easy.
$20,000?
Tallahassee.
Listen, I'm gonna go meet the fence.
I'll meet you with the money.
Remember where?
The parking structure by the tracks.
Yes.
9:00 sharp.
Just so there's no mix-ups...
So I guess we're keeping this one?
How can we not? Look how good it looks on you.
Tallahassee, baby.
We're almost home.
Home...
You got the wrong guy, officer!
I wasn't even jaywalking!
It's not like that.
You want to protect Emma? Come with me.
What?
Get up.
How do you know Emma?
Name's August.
And it's a long story,
but trust me, you want to hear it.
All right, August.
You're not a cop?
Who are you? You got two minutes.
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.
Guardian angel?
I'd say you've been doing a pretty crap job.
I've been looking for her for the past two years.
Now I finally find her,
and she's robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat.
Tell me again who's doing the crap job.
Let me tell you something.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her.
Two years? Where were you the rest of her life?
I'm not perfect.
This world? Full of temptations.
Turns out I'm not that great at saying no.
I'm not built that way.
But I'm here now.
Who are you?
We were in the same home as kids,
and I thought she'd be safe inside the system,
but now that she's out.
Back then I promised I would take care of her.
Well, we promised to take care of each other.
You love her. Good.
That means you have to do right by her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Then leave her.
Never.
She has a destiny,
and you--this life?
You're gonna keep her from it.
Okay.
Do you believe in magic?
I take it you do.
So will you...trust me?
I'm gonna show you something--
something that's gonna make you look at everything differently.
And when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen.
You're gonna believe every word I say.
Yeah, right.
Okay. I'm listening.
There's a curse...
and it needs to be broken.
Emma is the key.
I was tasked with keeping her on track,
and you, my friend,
just got caught in the crossfire.
Now I'm gonna tell you a story,
and at the end of it, you're gonna have to make a decision.
Will you do the right thing...
or not?
So...are you ready?
The number you are trying to reach is out of service.
If you think you've reached this message in error...
Damn right, it's an error.
Unless he set you up.
Hands above your head, please, Miss.
Wait. Why?
Possession of stolen goods.
Left you holding.
I have nothing.
Sorry to tell you, but your boy took off.
Probably in Canada by now.
He called in a tip,
told us to take a look at the surveillance footage at the train station.
Give me the watch.
Now!
You know your rights?
Yeah.
Good girl. Turn around.
Where's the rest of the watches?
They're gone.
They're not coming back.
Let's go.
So it's just... in here somewhere?
Allegedly.
Give me a boost, would you, love?
So I can't see what you're pocketing? No way.
You give me a boost.
Try something new, darling--
It's called trust.
We do it side by side, and fast.
Who knows how long before the--
Someone's up.
Quickly. Get under something.
Hook?
Been a while.
Where'd you go?
Tried to lose myself.
It didn't work.
I want to talk to you about Emma.
I hope you're not trying to reach out.
I just--I feel like--if-- if I knew that she was okay,
I could move on.
Is she?
She will be. She got 11 months.
That should be me. I should be doing that time.
No. We went over this. It's good.
How's it good?
It's a minimum security place in Phoenix,
and no, I am not going to tell you which one.
She'll get out of there and she'll be fine.
You keep your promise and steer clear,
and she can have a good life.
She can do what she's supposed to do.
And if I can't be there for her, man,
you gotta promise me that you will be.
I promise.
All right, then you should do something for me.
I was able to fence the watches.
Don't judge me. I'm giving it all to her.
And the car. I got a clean V.I.N. number for it,
so it's legit.
I just...
It'll feel like I'm there with her, you know?
Money's not what she needs-- not for what's ahead.
Can you just see that she gets it?
Sure.
And one more thing.
If anything changes,
and she does her job,
this insanity ends, and she's free--
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm not what you think!
You're a thief, and you poisoned me,
so yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think.
No. Look, you have a compass.
I need it.
I don't care what you need.
No, for my son!
To save my son!
Don't you have a family?
No!
Because humans killed them all.
Nice security system.
Efficient.
No. No! No! No! No!
I can tell by your face you know what this is.
Let me guess--it's dipped in some sort of poison.
You have a compass.
I need it.
You're gonna kill me either way.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
You don't know me.
I know your kind.
They massacred us and destroyed our beans.
I heard it the other way.
Because the victors get to tell the story.
Okay! Stop.
Here.
See?
I'm not the bad guy.
Maybe you are telling the truth.
Doesn't really matter.
I have to go. Are there any more of you?
No.
I'm alone.
What's this?
Is this a bean?
Can this make a portal?
Not anymore.
It was destroyed, like the rest of them.
I wear it as a reminder--
a reminder that you're all killers.
You're wrong.
Go.
Why?
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor. Now go before I change my mind.
Actually...
I get two favors.
What?
Well, the way I see it, I could've killed you twice--
The poison and when you were knocked out.
I didn't.
What do you want?
Hook.
You are bloody brilliant.
Amazing.
May I see it?
The compass.
It's more beautiful than legend.
Come. Let's go.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hook, I...
I-I can't--
Emma, look at me. Have I told you a lie?
I brought you here.
I risked my own safety to help you.
The compass is in your hand. Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? You're sorry?!
I got you here! I got you the compass!
I got the compass.
You're just gonna leave me here to die?
Have that beast to eat me, to crush my bones?
He's not a beast,
and you're not gonna die.
I just need a head start. That's all.
Swan.
Swan!
Swan!
Whoa. Wait! What are you doing?
Just stay back. Emma gave me ten hours.
No! No! No!
What, you're gonna just leave her to die?
Ten hours.
She may already be dead.
No.
No!
No! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
This was your daughter's wish!
I don't care what you say!
You do not put my daughter in danger!
Stop!
Emma.
You okay?
Two earthquakes and a jump from a beanstalk.
I think my brain's still rattling around a little.
I did what she ordered,
nothing more than that.
Did you get it?
Yep.
W-where's Hook?
He's detained. Let's go. Get your stuff.
We got ten hours before he follows us.
What? How?
I got a friend looking after him till then.
You told her to cut it down?
Yes. I couldn't risk--
We go back together.
That is the only way.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Now let's go get that dust from Cora.
Yeah, and go home.
Swan, you got mail.
Know anyone in Phuket?
I've gotta open this in front of you. Those are the rules.
Okay. Look.
Car keys.
Hope you got the car it goes with.
Nothing else. No letter. Sorry.
But good news. You get a car when you get out.
And a baby.
Congratulations.
Henry?
Henry.
It's okay.
Okay. You're okay. You're okay.
I just had the worst nightmare.
It's over now.
Okay.
Okay?
Here.
This will help.
A candle?
Yeah. They keep the nightmares away.
Okay. Now talk to me.
What was so bad?
I was in this room, and...
And it was red.
And there was no doors,
no windows.
And these curtains...
And they were on fire.
And I was in this corner.
Right.
And I was looking up,
and there was someone else there.
She was staring at me through the flames.
Then I woke up and--
Hey, don't worry, all right?
