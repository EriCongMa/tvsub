i lost my father ...
when i was 9 years old .
he was shot and killed right in front of me .
is that your daughter ? where is she ?
she &apos;s with my sister .
this is about you .
there &apos;s no history at your sister &apos;s place .
promise me she &apos;ll be ok morgan .
do it and promise him !
promise me morgan .
ok
ok !
i promise .
i love you ellie .
oh my hands are numb .
one more try . you can do it .
am i close ?
just keep trying .
i can &apos;t i can &apos;t .
my babies ...
sam and kayla wake up !
oh my babies ...
sammy ! kayla wake up !
he took them from me .
just keep trying .
you can do it .
oh no .
no !
you get away from her !
get away from her !
come here ! you never fought a man
in your pathetic life you twisted psycho .
no ! get out of our house !
no ! please ! stop it !
please !
last night all 4 members of the bennett family
were killed in their home in council bluffs iowa .
jake and sandra bennett were the parents
of sammy 11 and kayla 9 .
agent beeks in the omaha field office called me .
the previous night the other family the archers
were killed just across the state line in nebraska .
he thinks it &apos;s the same offender .
the m.o. is consistent .
both mothers died due to severe blunt @-@ force trauma
and the fathers suffered multiple stab wounds .
the children were all strangled .
violence only in the kids &apos; rooms
but no sexual abuse on any of the children .
that &apos;s odd .
odd comes up right now
because the bennett father was not just stabbed
he was also ...
and those pictures are in your personal files
because i didn &apos;t think they needed the help of 1080p .
his chest was opened organs disturbed intestines removed .
that &apos;s awesome . could we please leave the gross part
of the conversation for the plane ?
the father of the archer family
had multiple stab wounds but no dissection .
so he went from piquerism to this overnight ?
2 families in 2 days . he &apos;s on a spree .
wheels up in 30 .
hey morgan .
ellie how did you get past airport security ?
i stayed real close to this family .
nobody asked .
if they had i would have said i was 12
&apos;cause you can fly by yourself .
this is not all right .
you can &apos;t just run away like this .
but that house is awful .
this older boy tries to watch me in the shower .
it &apos;s way early in l.a.
i left a message with child protective services
but i haven &apos;t heard--
you can &apos;t send me back there .
ellie you &apos;re a missing kid .
we have to let them know you &apos;re safe .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
i know .
listen this is one of my very good friends penelope .
she &apos;s going to look after you while i &apos;m gone .
hi honey .
ellie i &apos;ll come back as soon as i can .
come on ellie .
go ahead .
it &apos;s ok .
come on ellie .
have you ever been here before ? you &apos;ll like it .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
&quot; all humanity is one undivided and indivisible family .
i cannot detach myself from the wickedest soul . &quot;
mahatma gandhi .
hotch listen .
garcia &apos;s gonna help me find a way to get ellie back to l.a.
how did she get here ?
she stole her foster mom &apos;s credit card
then bought a ticket online
and then somehow lied her way through airport security .
how old is she ?
she &apos;s 9 .
i didn &apos;t see this coming at all but i will fix it .
check this out .
no forced entry at either house .
both dinner tables are set for 5 people not 4 .
maybe they knew him and invited him to dinner .
both families live in different states
but only 8 miles apart .
is it possible they knew each other ?
garcia did you find any overlap between
the bennett and archer families ?
zip . they didn &apos;t work shop eat or worship
in any of the same places .
worship ?
both families religious ?
and then some .
pretty much all their social lives
revolved around some kind of church activities .
maybe he forced the families
to make dinner as part of a ritual
like karl arnold .
the fox was a classic family annihilator
who targeted patriarchs .
the dissection of the last dad makes me think the unsub
was focused on male parents as well .
i &apos;m not so sure .
there &apos;s a lot of overkill on the mothers .
all right when we land
morgan prentiss and i will go get set up
at the field office with agent beeks .
dave you and reid drive to council bluffs
while the crime scene &apos;s still fresh .
family annihilators tend to kill the children first .
it makes the parents suffer the most .
maybe that wasn &apos;t the only reason .
mom comes up to say that dinner is ready .
first thing she sees the children .
she runs to them .
she opens up her back to attack .
he uses the children as bait .
the father arrives next .
he runs to the family just as the mother did .
the unsub repeats the attack .
it worked the first time .
it &apos;s a risky plan .
the unsub needs 10.0r 15 minutes
alone with the children to tie them up .
the table &apos;s set for 5 .
they were going to have tacos .
the big pot has red meat
the small one has ...
some sort of tofu mix .
now if a psychopath was forcing you to cook dinner
would you take the time to make vegetarian sides ?
he obviously didn &apos;t force sandra to make dinner .
she wasn &apos;t afraid of him .
he was their guest .
he &apos;s too disorganized to bring a gun .
all the other items he used on the families
came from within the house .
kitchen knives jump ropes belts .
the bennetts trusted him with their kids .
they had to have known this guy .
联邦调查局当地办事处
m.e. report on jake bennett says he died less than a minute
after being stabbed multiple times .
all dissection was done postmortem .
if it was done postmortem
it was probably done out of curiosity and not torture .
is there any indication of medical training ?
apparently it &apos;s just the opposite .
the cuts were crude .
no more advanced than dissecting a frog .
sandra bennett died slowly in a lot of pain
just like monica archer .
the wives suffer the most
physically and psychologically .
so what does that get us ? this guy hates his mother ?
it means that everything he did
he did to hurt sandra and monica .
he &apos;s targeting women .
how &apos;s she doing ?
sleeping .
which i get the impression
she has not done in many weeks .
there are 6 kids living in that foster house .
well what did the family say ?
they didn &apos;t know she was missing .
sandra was a sixth @-@ grade teacher
she ran a church program for adult literacy
and volunteered at a local soup kitchen .
monica archer was a nurse at northern omaha medical
and she worked pro bono with
disabled veterans at the v.a.
maybe he posed as a victim asked for their help .
it &apos;s likely these women would help a stranger
but doubtful that they &apos;d let him upstairs .
it could be another volunteer .
if they met him doing charity work
he could seem trustworthy .
ok so we &apos;ll look into volunteers who worked
with both monica archer and sandra bennett
but even so
neither of these women would have left their children
with someone they didn &apos;t know well .
it &apos;s unlikely that it &apos;s a stranger
but we haven &apos;t found a single person
that knew both families .
great . so we have a disorganized killer
on a spree who appears perfectly stable .
people trust him on sight .
and he has absolute confidence
that no one will guess what he is .
* if i could write you a song and make you fall in love *
* i would already have you up under my arm *
hey kid .
come closer so i can talk to you for a second .
what do you want ?
you shouldn &apos;t walk with your back to traffic .
you can &apos;t see the cars . you know what i mean ?
oh ok .
i &apos;m reverend hannum .
i &apos;m jeremy .
do you need a lift ?
my mom says i shouldn &apos;t get into a car with someone i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;d like kill me .
your mom &apos;s right .
but there &apos;s a gas station a mile or so up the road .
i could take you there .
well that sounds all right .
cool . um thanks .
it &apos;s getting cold out .
i love this song .
me too .
put your seatbelt on .
* you never say hey remember my name *
* and it &apos;s probably &apos; cause you think you &apos;re cooler than me ? *
he dissected the victim &apos;s arm postmortem .
i think it &apos;s our guy .
just one victim ?
yeah .
he &apos;s in the passenger seat .
who is he ?
louis hannum .
41 years old well @-@ known local reverend .
he closed the church after a canned food drive at 6 p.m.
told the other volunteers
he was taking the donations to the salvation army
3 miles northeast on route 6 .
did he leave with anyone ?
no they said he left alone .
we &apos;re still getting names of everyone who was there .
before now he &apos;s attacked families in their homes .
now just one victim on the side of the road ?
it doesn &apos;t--it doesn &apos;t really fit his victimology .
well it looks like he stabbed the reverend
while he was driving and then the truck crashed down here
he pushed him over tried to drive away
but the truck was stuck .
his rage was so blinding he takes out the driver
while in motion .
he &apos;s lucky he didn &apos;t crash into oncoming traffic .
then he immediately calms down
and dissects the victim &apos;s arm ?
yeah he &apos;s incapable of thinking 5 minutes ahead .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s got a.d.d.
a short attention span is putting it mildly .
he &apos;s got wild mood swings he &apos;s impulsive .
young adults are inherently nonthreatening .
parents would allow him to be alone with their children
because he &apos;s the same age .
if he &apos;s prepubescent it would also explain
why there &apos;s no sexual experimentation on the victims .
you guys can &apos;t be serious .
think about it .
he opens up human bodies out of curiosity
the same way i used to open up radios and tv sets when i was 13 .
i don &apos;t like it here .
amber you told me you needed to use the bathroom
asap 5 times until i stopped .
this is a bathroom .
i didn &apos;t mean a gross bathroom .
don &apos;t touch anything .
you can get herpes or worse .
zack enough .
mom ...
if i get herpes it &apos;s your fault .
oh come on .
hey there .
are you all right ?
this kid is streetwise
but clearly comfortable and
easily accepted in a middle @-@ class suburban home .
we can &apos;t diagnose anyone under the age of 18
as antisocial
so we are labeling this unsub a budding psychopath .
i came out of the bathroom and the bus was gone .
the bus stopped out here ?
well yeah . this woman was sick
and she said she needed some air .
where &apos;s your mom hon ?
well we live in omaha
but my mom &apos;s visiting my aunt in chicago .
his interpersonal skills are through the roof .
now this manipulation is not just a ruse .
it is a complex con .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have gotten off .
well maybe i should just call your mom for you .
does she have a cell phone ?
yeah ! um it &apos;s ...
my phone &apos;s on the bus .
i was supposed to memorize the numbers but i never did .
if i don &apos;t get off the bus in chicago tomorrow morning
my mom will freak out .
look for reports of missing children
in and around the city of omaha .
this is where his killing spree originated .
and check juvenile detention centers and psychiatric programs
for boys who &apos;ve been recently released or escaped .
we believe he &apos;s crossed the state line into iowa .
his last victim was traveling northeast on route 6 .
how has a kid gotten 40 @-@ some miles all by himself ?
they all give him rides and places to stay .
well you can &apos;t stay out here all alone .
we &apos;ll go to the police .
they can find your mom a lot faster than we can .
really ?
thank you so much .
yeah come on .
thank you .
he appears extremely vulnerable .
being a child alone out on the road
that &apos;s not hard to do .
come on !
uhh ! come on !
you &apos;re letting him go to jail .
no honey this is a police station .
they &apos;ll help him find his mom .
do you mind if we wait here a minute
until those guys have gone in ?
you &apos;re gonna need a weapon or something
in case that guy tries to shiv you .
zack .
will i have to sleep in the same prison cell as him ?
absolutely not . you &apos;re not sleeping in a cell .
what if they don &apos;t find his mom tonight ?
if i take a bus to uncle david &apos;s and get lost
would i have to sleep in jail too ?
no amber of course not .
get your hands off me !
jeremy won &apos;t be sleeping here either .
you &apos;re staying with us tonight .
thank you so much .
we &apos;ll bring you back in the morning .
thanks .
no i know as soon as ellie
crossed state lines it became a federal case .
mm @-@ hmm . which is why it &apos;s ok
that she remain in federal custody .
what are the chances of getting her transferred to virginia ?
oh they are quite good .
because the federal child abuse prevention and treatment act
defines this as neglect .
it &apos;s in her best interest that she be removed immediately .
well that &apos;s good . that &apos;s great .
baby girl thank you .
do me a favor .
tell her to keep her head up all right ?
i will honey .
what &apos;s going on ?
the foster family didn &apos;t even know ellie was missing .
i &apos;m doing what i can to get her transferred
to child protective services in virginia .
you think that &apos;s a good idea ?
i just want to know that that girl is safe .
if you asked me to look after jack
would you be happy right now ?
i know that you &apos;d do everything you could .
he &apos;s been in the system ?
i thought you said he &apos;s from suburbia .
he grew up in medium socio @-@ economic status
but his rage against families tells us that he experienced
extreme abuse or neglect
so at some point he was most likely
removed from his family .
now i had garcia widen the search of missing children
to those in foster homes and juvenile care facilities
all represented by these 10 black dots .
10 kids fit our profile . that &apos;s great .
actually each dot represents a thousand currently in the system .
10.000 children ?
nebraska &apos;s one of the nation &apos;s highest per capita
state ward populations .
now using the age and the gender of our suspect
i was able to whittle down the search
and that yielded this interesting pattern .
a pattern of red dots .
give me one more hint .
the red dots represent
33 boys between the age of 10 and 17
who became wards of the state this year
all abandoned at major hospitals .
the state safe haven law .
wait a minute . i thought the safe haven law
was so that women could leave unwanted babies in hospitals
instead of leaving them in dumpsters .
that &apos;s correct but initially
there was no age limit in nebraska .
he &apos;s right . the law now just covers infants
but we still get teenagers left at hospitals
with a note pinned to their jacket .
some are even driven in from out of state .
now monica archer our first victim
worked at this hospital northern omaha medical .
if the unsub &apos;s parents abandoned him there
it &apos;s probably where they met .
oh bummer .
hey did you get &quot; god of war &quot; ?
no but i heard .
i heard it &apos;s awesome .
jeremy will you dial your home number ?
i &apos;m just gonna leave a message saying that you &apos;re staying here .
yeah sure but like i said
i don &apos;t think she &apos;ll check the home messages .
oh just in case .
mom jeremy says he knows a really cool game .
can we go play it in zack &apos;s room before dinner ?
not now . it &apos;s time to eat .
can we have sodas since we have a guest ?
no . a guest does not mean soda .
here you go .
you just have to hit send .
amber zack this is why you have to memorize
my cell phone and uncle david &apos;s ok ?
hi this is the archers &apos; .
we &apos;re not home right now . please leave us a message
and we &apos;ll call you right back .
hi . hello . my name is nancy riverton .
and uh your son jeremy
missed his bus at the rest stop on route 6 .
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s safe . don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s with me .
but if you could just give me a call as soon as you get this .
i &apos;m at 515 @-@ 555 @-@ 0154 .
ok . thanks .
so what happens here when a child is abandoned ?
the hospital contacts social services .
the act of abandonment immediately labels the parents unfit
and the child becomes a ward of the state .
so he goes into foster care .
ideally but most parents won &apos;t take older children .
in which case he &apos;d be sent to a juvenile facility .
the same one that houses delinquents ?
that &apos;s right .
did northern omaha medical register an adolescent boy
as a ward of the state on that day ?
garcia said no but she &apos;s still looking .
if monica wanted to keep him out of a facility
she might have gone around protocol .
but she might still have documented it .
reid and rossi go to the archer house
and see if you can figure out what her plan was .
ok .
there you go sweetheart .
you get some sleep and we &apos;ll get in touch
with your mom in the morning ok ?
it &apos;s all gonna be all right .
thanks .
uh don &apos;t turn that light off .
i &apos;m not scared . it &apos;s just ...
of course . i understand .
you come get me if you need anything ok ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;ll find .
this was the first crime scene
so believe me my guys went over it with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
i &apos;m sure they did but now we know that mrs. archer
chose to take the suspect home
instead of taking him so social services like she should have
we need to try to figure out why .
she was a nurse for 15 years .
she would know how to work the system .
maybe she called in favors with social workers
or knew some foster parents that could take him in .
they &apos;ve got messages .
my guys checked it the first day . those must be new .
this is brittany at dr. olsen &apos;s office .
eric missed his 9 a.m. please call to reschedule .
hi . hello . my name is nancy riverton
and your son jeremy missed his bus
at the rest stop on route 6 .
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s safe . don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s with me .
but if you could just give me a call ...
what were the names of the archer children ?
eric and daniel . no jeremy .
and she said she picked up this kid on route 6 .
it &apos;s him .
hey i need an address for a number--515--
that &apos;s des moines .
name is nancy riverton .
it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re the fbi . you guys are safe now .
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
he left with my mom . he &apos;s got a knife .
he woke us up in the middle of the night .
he said it was a game .
you &apos;ve got to find them .
it &apos;s ok . you guys are ok .
it &apos;s all right . ok .
do you want a soda or a burger ?
you must be starving .
i &apos;m not gonna fall for that .
you &apos;d leave me there .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
your mother shouldn &apos;t have left you .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s sorry .
she will be .
where &apos;s your dad ?
he died when i was little .
i &apos;m sorry .
do you know where he took our mom ?
not yet . but there are a
whole lot of people looking for her right now .
did this boy tell you his name
where he lives goes to school ?
he said he was going to his aunt &apos;s house in chicago .
but he lives in omaha .
he said his name is jeremy .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . just take your time .
i just want you to try and tell me about this game .
it wasn &apos;t a game . he just wanted to scare my mom .
when your mom saw you tied up on the floor
what did she do ?
it was weird .
she told him he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
all this stuff about how he &apos;s a good kid and just made a mistake .
why would she say that after what he did to us ?
zack it sounds like your mom understood how dangerous jeremy is
and she needed to get him out of the house .
it &apos;s like she made him a deal or something .
she said she &apos;d drive him anywhere he wants to go .
and what was his answer ?
he said he wanted to go home .
do you play any sports ?
i seem like a team player to you ?
there must be something you like at school .
a club or a class ?
i like science .
i like ...
taking things apart .
do you ever wonder what &apos;s under your skin ?
nope .
i don &apos;t .
monica archer called a
friend at the northern omaha children &apos;s hospital
about an abandoned 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
monica was going to bring him in the next day .
we need to talk to that friend .
oh no i already did that .
apparently the children &apos;s hospital and child services
have a strong rapport .
did she get a name ?
yeah . she said the child &apos;s name was niko bellic
and his hometown was newton iowa .
say that again-- niko bellic ?
the thing about that is that--
nico bellic is the name of a main character
in &quot; grand theft auto iv . &quot;
what ? i know things .
guys he &apos;s headed due east on route 6 .
it passes right through newton .
he probably didn &apos;t expect
the question and gave away his real hometown .
garcia call the owa state police tell them
to be on the lookout for a minivan headed east towards route 6 .
will do .
if i open this up you think the air bag will blow out ?
why don &apos;t you try it see what happens .
zack &apos;s a little punk .
but amber she &apos;ll be hot though
when she &apos;s older .
you know if i wanted
i could climb into her room some night
when you &apos;re all sleeping .
or you could just ring the doorbell
and come over to dinner sometime .
don &apos;t lie !
you think i &apos;m a bad kid .
i never said that .
you didn &apos;t have to .
2.200 families in newton have kids under the age of 18 .
in other words a lot .
he would have acted out long before now .
he &apos;s got a juvie record he &apos;s well known to truant officers
and he &apos;s probably been kicked out of school maybe several .
we thought he was running away but he &apos;s heading home .
he &apos;s got a plan .
taking his rage out on surrogate mothers
isn &apos;t doing it for him anymore .
now he &apos;s ready for the real thing .
garcia we need to i.d.
this kid so we can find his mom and warn her .
got it .
emily get her back .
everybody ?
no just garcia .
i haven &apos;t found her yet .
hey it &apos;s me .
can anyone hear us ?
if by anyone you mean 9 @-@ year @-@ old girls
getting snacks then no . what &apos;s up ?
i want you to try and find ellie &apos;s mom .
l.a. county couldn &apos;t find her .
they &apos;re not you baby girl .
they sure aren &apos;t .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
you know zack he &apos;s not the goody @-@ good boy you think he is .
do you know what websites he looks at ?
you think your kid is so special .
but underneath he &apos;s just like me .
you &apos;re a good kid in your heart .
why do you keep saying that ?
because i believe that children are born good .
your feelings are hurt . you &apos;re angry .
you &apos;re acting out .
i don &apos;t blame you .
my mom blames me for everything .
my dad left .
my sister gets hurt .
it &apos;s all my fault .
i don &apos;t blame you .
i think you need help .
i think you need love and attention .
none of this is your fault .
you can pull over .
we &apos;re almost to my house .
i &apos;ll take you home like i said .
i &apos;m not that stupid nancy .
i &apos;m not gonna show you where i live .
now pull over .
i &apos;ll walk from here .
well here we are .
you couldn &apos;t wait to get away from me huh ?
no .
admit you can &apos;t stand me .
that &apos;s not true .
i like you .
32 kids with juvie records
have been absent from school in the last 3 days .
i can send police to their mothers
i can start calling houses--
no garcia
we don &apos;t have time for trial by error
we gotta narrow it down .
ok the kids at the last house said that the unsub
liked to play a game .
he liked tying the kids up and scaring them
and he knew what he was doing .
he used socks and belts .
he &apos;s done it before garcia .
so you want me to look for kids
who &apos;ve picked on their little brothers and sisters ?
i &apos;m an only child but isn &apos;t
that standard for you people with siblings ?
budding psychopaths don &apos;t just pick on their siblings .
they torture them .
ok well none of them have assault records .
not yet anyway .
is there any way to see if any of the younger siblings
have been in the emergency room in the last 6 months ?
medical info like that is molasses slow to get unless i ...
please hold for genius .
got it . i figured a suspicious visit to the er
might end up in a social services report and it did .
10 days ago
the admitting doctor called about a sayer family
at 1365 hunter drive .
jeremy sayer is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old
with a disturbingly long juvie record .
wow . his 9 @-@ year @-@ old sister carrie
was brought to the hospital with a spiral arm fracture .
the kind you get from having
your arm twisted behind your back too far .
you want to play a game ?
no .
kendra sayer &apos;s boss said she left work already .
i have her cell phone .
what do you have on mr. sayer ?
he moved to wisconsin 3 years ago .
i &apos;m looking at the phone records right now .
he hasn &apos;t contacted the family in 10 months .
mom we &apos;ve been through this .
there had to be another option
than just abandoning your own flesh and blood by the side of the road .
it wasn &apos;t the side of the road .
do you want him to come live with you ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
what area code is 202 ?
i don &apos;t know . new york maybe .
look i had to protect carrie .
she was so terrified of him
she wouldn &apos;t admit he broke her arm .
she sent me to voicemail again .
keep trying .
did you see him break her arm ?
no mom of course i didn &apos;t .
then how are you sure ?
for the same reason i was sure
when i found rat pellets in the thanksgiving turkey .
for the same reason i was sure
when our neighbor &apos;s dog went missing .
sorry . this person keeps calling .
hello ?
mrs. sayer
this is agent prentiss from the fbi .
i need to talk to you about your son jeremy .
i don &apos;t have a son .
i -- i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
mrs. sayer it &apos;s important that you and your daughter
stay away from your home .
we have reason to believe jeremy &apos;s heading there now .
oh god .
he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s in the house .
ma &apos;am do not go inside the house .
we &apos;ll be there in 2 minutes .
i have to go inside . he &apos;s got carrie .
carrie ! carrie ? carrie ?
hi mom .
jeremy let her go please .
no ! please please !
sure thing . but i want you to tell me the truth first .
truth ? what truth ?
that you always hated me .
jeremy -- jeremy please just let her go .
admit it .
admit it and i won &apos;t hurt your little sugarplum .
i don &apos;t know --
i don &apos;t know what you want me to say .
i don &apos;t . i swear .
say what i heard
you telling father quincy .
say it !
oh my god . i -- i --
confess and be forgiven !
isn &apos;t that what you always tell me ?
i was pregnant with twins .
and then one day i wasn &apos;t .
is that what you wanna hear ?
the doctor said one fetus consumed the other .
i wasn &apos;t even born yet and you blamed me ? !
you are rotten to the core ! you always have been .
fbi ! drop your weapon .
maybe i made you into a monster
because i hated you when you were inside me !
but i think i hated you
because i knew what you were !
don &apos;t do it jeremy .
do you want to die ?
you won &apos;t shoot me
when mommy &apos;s little angel can get hurt .
yes or no ?
i &apos;ll cut her neck open .
i know how to do it .
i &apos;ve practiced .
no please !
i &apos;m not gonna ask you again jeremy .
you can &apos;t shoot a kid .
i can shoot a killer . and i will believe that .
if that knife even twitches
i &apos;m gonna put a bullet right through your brain .
if i let her go--
there is no if .
fine .
i was only kidding anyway .
turn around .
aah ! ah ! mom he &apos;s hurting me !
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
mom i can &apos;t go by myself !
mom !
mom ! mom ! mom !
settle down .
your mother &apos;s not coming .
whatever .
i &apos;m 13 .
i &apos;ll see her in 5 years anyway .
don &apos;t count on it .
i &apos;m gonna be at every one of your parole hearings
and that &apos;s a promise .
now get in the car .
nancy riverton got out of surgery . she &apos;s gonna make it .
she &apos;s lucky .
she managed to control him long enough
to save her children . she &apos;s impressive .
mrs. sayer asked that she and her daughter be notified
if and when jeremy is released .
bau should keep his file handy too .
excuse me .
i heard garcia found ellie &apos;s mom .
yeah .
she had a hard time being married to a cop
so she moved back east for a while .
she travels a lot .
you think that &apos;s a solution ?
i just don &apos;t know how she could leave that little girl .
she probably left a bad marriage .
hotch that &apos;s her child .
how does she just walk out of her life like that ?
maybe she didn &apos;t have any other options .
most parents try to do what &apos;s best for their kids .
maybe being with her dad in california was more stable ?
her mom couldn &apos;t offer her that ?
kids are adaptable but they need somebody they can depend on .
maybe her mom can give her that now .
how will i know ?
you &apos;ll know .
agent morgan ?
ma &apos;am .
you weren &apos;t easy to find .
i just got back to the states .
so you didn &apos;t know about matt ?
i had no idea .
i &apos;m so sorry .
hey you .
look i get it .
you and your ex @-@ husband had your share of problems
so you separated .
but how could you not be in ellie &apos;s life ?
i tried .
matt pushed me away .
said they were better without me .
were they ?
i wasn &apos;t happy .
matt and i ...
ellie used to walk around with the biggest frown .
and i thought i had done that to her .
she &apos;s angry because that &apos;s how she sees me .
so what are you saying ?
you &apos;re better now ?
i &apos;ve wondered if you &apos;d like the places i &apos;ve been .
if you still took ballet .
if tulips are still your favorite .
go ahead .
look at it .
you wrote to her every day .
so what ?
ellie ...
she wrote to me every day .
who cares ?
this book means that your mom never stopped thinking about you .
ellie you know that i lost my father the same way that you did .
and it &apos;s really hard growing up without your dad .
i miss my dad every day .
but my mom
she means everything to me .
i gave your dad my word that i would keep you safe .
ellie right now you have a chance
to have a really good life with your mom .
just give it a try .
i remember that we used to read stories together all the time .
i miss that .
me too .
let me show you something .
ok .
thank you .
&quot; but i have promises to keep
&quot; and miles to go before i sleep .
&quot; and miles to go before i sleep . &quot;
