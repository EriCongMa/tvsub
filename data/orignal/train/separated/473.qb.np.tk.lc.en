the caller
hello ?
i &apos;m gonna get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
stop it . i mean it . this isn &apos;t funny anymore .
stop calling here .
who was it ?
that damn kid again .
i can &apos;t believe the police won &apos;t do anything about it .
where have you been ?
i couldn &apos;t sleep . i went downstairs to watch tv
and i conked out on the couch .
isn &apos;t that guy at your office a retired cop--
jake ?
yeah .
can you talk to him ?
what &apos;s he gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just want somebody to do something .
that kid &apos;ll get bored soon enough .
ok , i &apos;ll talk to jake .
andy , breakfast is ready !
can you please take kozmo out ?
kozmo !
kozmo , come on . let &apos;s go , buddy .
andy !
you &apos;re gonna be late !
andy !
andrew taffert ,
you cannot miss the bus again .
if you are still asleep , i &apos;m gonna pour cold water on you .
andy ?
andy &apos;s not in his room . have you seen him ?
oh , my god !
what is that ?
andy ? !
andy !
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m calling the police .
andy !
andy ?
did you see what i did ?
did you see it ?
we just got a call from st. louis .
a missing child , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , andrew taffert .
parents lida and malcolm .
father found blood on the front door this morning .
i take it no test results on the blood yet .
no . that would be correct .
no signs of forced entry or a struggle
according to the initial police report .
mom and dad put him to bed at 10 : 00,
woke up this morning , he was gone .
any visitors or workers to the house recently ?
no . but the parents say in the last two weeks
they &apos;ve received 5 phone calls
from what sounds like a little boy prank calling them .
they complained to authorities ,
but police determined that no laws had been broken .
mm @-@ hmm . the little boy says , &quot; i &apos;m gonna get you . &quot;
according the police reports ,
there &apos;s a lot of crazy people talking in the background .
it sounds like it &apos;s coming from an asylum or a prison .
i &apos;d say the calls might be coincidental
except the boy called again
right after the parents found andy missing ,
and he had a different message this time .
&quot; did you see what i did ? &quot;
so he &apos;s taunting them .
maybe this is about revenge .
&quot; i &apos;m gonna get you &quot; is typically a threat ,
but in the case of children ,
it can also be a phrase used during play .
this sounds similar to a cold case from 15 years ago ,
frankie clayvin of memphis .
i remember that gideon handled it .
it obviously predates all of you .
frankie clayvin was 9 years old at the time .
he never made it home from school one day .
he was found dead in the woods 36 hours later
5 miles from his house .
and frankie &apos;s parents also received
prank phone calls from a young boy .
i think frankie &apos;s father was the prime suspect at one point .
yeah , the police actually tapped the clayvins &apos; phone ,
but they couldn &apos;t trace the phone calls
because they kept bouncing between different pay phones
in the greater memphis area .
phone calls before an abduction @-@ murder--
it &apos;s a rare signature .
but if it is the same unsub ,
a dormancy period of 15 years is highly unusual .
maybe we &apos;re looking at a copycat .
if i &apos;m not mistaken ,
frankie clayvin was killed within two hours of his abduction .
which means we &apos;re wasting time . let &apos;s go .
911 . what is your emergency ?
my son is gone !
i checked his room this morning and he &apos;s gone !
i can &apos;t--
we can &apos;t find him anywhere .
he &apos;s only 10 .
ok , ma &apos;am . we &apos;re sending a unit right away .
what &apos;s your son &apos;s name ?
we have a missing child at 472 oakdale drive ,
last seen yesterday at 2100 hours .
andrew taffert , born 2003,
4 feet 7 inches , short blond hair , blue eyes ,
wearing an orange sweatshirt and plaid pajama pants .
we &apos;re labeling as suspicious circumstances
and a possible abduction .
&quot; fear is pain arising from anticipation of evil . &quot;
aristotle .
just confirmed there was a 10 @-@ minute segment
on the unsolved frankie clayvin murder
on a low @-@ rated cable show 12 years ago .
even with low ratings , probably a half million people saw it .
376,000 .
it &apos;s not often i get to correct another genius .
that makes it more likely it could be a copycat .
there &apos;s nothing unusual about the tafferts .
the father malcolm is a stockbroker ,
mother works at an antique shop .
they describe andy as a bright , well @-@ behaved kid
who likes video games .
andy and frankie are about the same age and build
with similar coloring .
if this is the same unsub , he definitely has a type .
we need to consider the possibility
that andy may have been targeted by a pedophile .
it could be someone he met online playing video games .
if there &apos;s any connection to the cold case , though ,
there was no evidence of sexual assault .
just in case , i am pulling up a list
of online players as we speak .
if this is the same unsub , he must be using another child
to make the prank phone calls .
the original boy from 15 years ago would be grown up by now .
or it &apos;s possible the calls are recordings .
guys , i just got a message from the local field office .
the analysis from the blood from the taffert house just came in ,
and good news-- it is not andy &apos;s .
actually it &apos;s pig &apos;s blood .
huh . between that and the phone calls ,
it &apos;s safe to say this unsub likes to play games .
blake and i will go talk to frankie clayvin &apos;s father .
the rest of you head to the taffert house .
the police made us sit and wait until something went wrong .
this makes no sense at all .
i know it feels that way , and we &apos;re very sorry ,
but we &apos;re just -- - you &apos;re sorry ?
you &apos;re sorry . do you have kids ?
no .
then you have no idea what this feels like .
sir , we don &apos;t presume to understand how hard this is for you ,
but what we can do is help you try to find andy .
were there any changes in the family routine recently ,
any new people that either you or your son
may have met socially or at work ?
no .
it &apos;s just the 3 of us , so we are very close .
when lida and i aren &apos;t working , we do everything together .
we &apos;re good people .
we go to church on sunday .
what about andy ? did you know all of his friends ?
yes . we are very careful about that .
we--i don &apos;t want him around kids who are a bad influence ,
so i run background checks on the parents of his friends .
and we taught andy to avoid strangers .
he &apos;s very cautious .
i apologize that i yelled at you .
that &apos;s not who i am .
it &apos;s just that this whole thing is surreal .
this kind of thing happens to other people ,
not to us .
&quot; i run background checks on the parents of his friends &quot; ?
sounds pretty controlling .
and they &apos;re selling themselves as good parents ,
especially him .
he could be trying to hide something .
excuse me .
sorry to interrupt .
could i ask you a question ?
of course .
i heard on the news last year
that if a child disappears
and the police can find him within the first 24 hours ,
the child will be ok .
is that right ?
it &apos;s no guarantee .
but statistically , yes .
so if andy was forcibly taken , why didn &apos;t he scream or call out ?
his parents &apos; room is right next door .
the unsub could have overpowered him ,
covered his mouth , or had a gun at his head .
hmm . look at this .
it wasn &apos;t locked .
so the unsub could have snuck in while he was sleeping .
that &apos;s interesting .
what ?
i don &apos;t see any sneakers .
i mean , almost every 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy has a pair , right ?
i guess they &apos;re somewhere else in the house ?
but mom seems like a neat freak .
what if andy &apos;s wearing them ?
that means he would have had time to put his shoes on and leave .
which means he was most likely coaxed out by someone he knew .
hey , garcia , perfect timing .
i have a list of online players
that andy taffert played video games with .
it &apos;s a short list since his parents
strictly controlled his internet access
and only allowed him to play with certain players .
5 school friends , to be exact .
any chance he met up with one of them last night ?
well , if he did , they didn &apos;t make those plans online .
all 5 of them were at school today ,
and according to p.d.
none of them knew about andy &apos;s disappearance .
all right . thanks .
so if he wasn &apos;t lured out by one of his friends , who was it ?
are you sure this is connected to my frankie ?
no , sir , we &apos;re not . but the circumstances are similar enough
that we have to consider the possibility .
could you tell us where you were last night ?
oh , i get it .
i &apos;m still a suspect after 15 years .
we just want to know where you were .
mr. clayvin .
did you see what i did ?
what was that ?
&quot; did you see what i did ? &quot;
it &apos;s what that creep said on the phone .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve been through .
we do know that a year before frankie was killed
that his mother committed suicide .
so we know you &apos;ve been through a lot .
just when you think it can &apos;t get any worse , it does .
what do you mean ?
about a year after frankie died ,
my second wife couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
she left me ,
and i had a nervous breakdown .
i was in a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks .
mr. clayvin , you have a phone call .
hello ?
i got you , didn &apos;t i ?
i told you i would get you .
it was that little boy again .
somehow he--he found me at the hospital .
why didn &apos;t you tell anyone about this before ?
what does it matter ?
no one ever believed me .
i would have .
there is no doubt in my mind that you &apos;re innocent .
last night i was at work .
i &apos;m a night security guard at a downtown office building .
i &apos;m on the surveillance camera .
thank you .
excuse me .
what have you got , garcia ?
i triangulated the phone call that came to the tafferts &apos; house
at 3 : 03 a.m. last night ,
and all i can say is whiskey @-@ tango @-@ foxtrot .
that call originated from malcolm taffert &apos;s cell phone .
ok . thank you .
of course i didn &apos;t make that call !
i told you , i went downstairs to watch tv
and i fell asleep on the couch ,
that the house phone woke me up .
where was your cell phone ?
in the den . i leave it there to charge overnight .
go ahead , check it . you &apos;ll see .
i didn &apos;t call my own home in the middle of the night .
you can &apos;t be serious .
there is absolutely no way
malcolm could have done something like this .
i know my husband .
what &apos;s his relationship like with andy ?
malcolm dotes on him .
it was like that from the minute he was born .
i swear , he changed more diapers than i did .
ok . um ,
you said there were a total of 4 phone calls
from the boy before andy disappeared .
were you and malcolm ever together for any of these calls ?
no .
it was always one of us .
alone .
there &apos;s nothing on his cell .
house phone caller i.d. at 3 : 03 a.m. says private number .
he could have erased the call from his phone .
dr. reid . got here as fast as i could .
i just came from the memphis office .
they apologized for the delay .
they had trouble finding it in storage .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to play you something
from the clayvin case 15 years ago .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
that &apos;s like the call we got .
you mean it &apos;s similar ?
no .
it &apos;s the exact same call .
blake was right . it &apos;s a recording .
this isn &apos;t a copycat .
we &apos;re dealing with the same unsub .
malcolm taffert would would have been in his early 20s
when frankie disappeared .
so it &apos;s possible he &apos;s the unsub ,
but he didn &apos;t seem to have a connection with the clayvin family .
he never even worked in the same city .
go ahead , garcia .
whoever &apos;s behind this is very tech savvy with phones .
as it turns out , the unsub
cloned malcolm taffert &apos;s cell number ,
and the call came from outside of the house ,
a quarter of a mile east , to be exact .
there &apos;s no way malcolm could have made that phone call
and been back in his bedroom by the time his wife hung up .
what &apos;s a quarter mile east of the taffert house ?
uh , i &apos;m seeing woods and a reservoir .
let &apos;s take malcolm with us .
he &apos;ll know where andy liked to play .
andy taffert !
we &apos;re the police ! we &apos;re here to help you !
there &apos;s an abandoned well out this way .
andy and his friends found it last summer .
and i told him i didn &apos;t like him to come out here ,
but ... well , he ignored me .
i don &apos;t understand .
you said there was a recording .
i &apos;m supposed to just talk to it ?
we have to assume whoever took andy is listening .
now , when he calls , try to stay as neutral as possible .
don &apos;t let him feed off your anxiety .
and remember , you &apos;re trying to start a dialogue ,
so avoid questions that have yes or no answers .
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
you have to .
now , the first question you &apos;re gonna ask is , how &apos;s andy doing ?
ok ?
uh , it &apos;s right up here .
get those up here !
hey , guys , what--what--
he may have found something .
mr. taffert ! mr. taffert !
we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s--
andy ! andy , is that you ? !
andy , it &apos;s daddy !
we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s him yet , mr. taffert .
he &apos;s not talking .
please let us handle this .
why--why isn &apos;t he talking ?
just let us do our job .
can you take him back to the house , please ?
why ...
please , just go . just go .
andy !
mr. taffert !
hello ?
i got you , didn &apos;t i ?
i told you i would get you .
how &apos;s andy doing ?
hello ?
hello !
andy was strangled with a nylon cord .
do you have an approximate time of death ?
based on rigor mortis , i &apos;d say 12 hours ago .
he was dead before he was reported missing .
he was killed within a couple hours of his abduction ,
the same m.o. as in frankie clayvin &apos;s case .
any sign of sexual assault ?
not on preliminary exam .
i mean , you saw he was fully dressed .
there &apos;s no sign the clothing was removed and then put back on .
excuse me .
you know , the way andy &apos;s body was found on that bed of leaves ,
it almost looked like he was sleeping .
the unsub wanted him to appear peaceful .
remorse ?
well , that &apos;s in stark contrast
to the violent imagery of blood on the tafferts &apos; front door .
&quot; i shall see the blood and pass you by . &quot;
exodus .
the tenth plague of egypt , the death of the firstborn .
god commanded moses to tell the israelites
to put lamb &apos;s blood above their door
to spare their firstborn .
the blood on the tafferts &apos; door could be related ,
but the unsub &apos;s got it backwards .
unless he thinks he spared andy a fate worse than death .
the other agent said he &apos;d be ok .
if they found him within 24 hours , he &apos;d be ok .
that &apos;s always the hope .
but we never know for sure .
oh , god .
he was dead before i even knew he was missing .
i didn &apos;t ...
i should have checked sooner .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
you guys can hang out in here for now .
can i get you anything ?
no , thank you .
excuse me .
are they the parents ?
yes .
i &apos;d like to talk with them .
i &apos;ll go check .
there &apos;s someone here who wants to speak with you .
would that be ok ?
sure .
go ahead .
my name is richard clayvin .
the same maniac who killed your boy ...
killed my son , too .
i &apos;m the only person in the world
who truly knows what you &apos;re going through right now .
look at how bereft they are .
that &apos;s hard to fake .
there &apos;s no way any of them are involved .
do you have any suspects or leads ?
what can you tell us ?
we &apos;re considering all suspects ,
but we &apos;re focusing outside the household at this time ,
so please respect the tafferts &apos; privacy and allow them to grieve .
we believe the same person who killed andy taffert
killed frankie clayvin of memphis 15 years ago .
the taunting phone calls mean he &apos;s sadistic to the parents .
and the use of the young boy &apos;s voice
means that he identifies in some way with the child .
now , he could be seeking revenge
for some injustice he suffered in his youth .
but then why kill the children ?
in his mind they may be mercy kills .
the fact that he &apos;s not torturing or sexually abusing them
and he &apos;s posing them as if they &apos;re sleeping suggests remorse .
based on his victim choice ,
he &apos;s likely a caucasian male in his late 30s
and possibly older .
we know he &apos;s technically skilled ,
so look for someone with a computer or engineering background .
and based on the blood left on the tafferts &apos; door ,
we may be looking for someone extremely religious .
he was able to lure andy away in the middle of the night ,
which suggests he &apos;s socially skilled
or he may know the victim &apos;s family .
although we only know of one other abduction @-@ murder 15 years ago ,
he may have been overseas , incarcerated ,
or incapacitated during that time .
so families with young sons should remain vigilant ,
and we ask that if anybody saw andy taffert late at night--
or anytime--with someone fitting the suspect &apos;s description
we ask that you call st . louis fbi immediately .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
all right , now , this is without the boy &apos;s voice .
listen to the background .
the voices are dozens of separate audio bytes all spliced together .
look .
all the different tracks layered on top of each other .
exactly . and the boy &apos;s voice
was the dominant layer .
were you able to get anything off the background sounds ?
there is something .
pare !
isso vai sair mais caro a voce .
now , my brazilian portuguese is rusty ,
but i think she saying &quot; stop , &quot; which is &quot; pare , &quot;
and then something about more money ,
something costing more money .
can you replay it ?
yeah .
pare !
isso vai sair mais caro a voce .
i hear something right before she says &quot; pare . &quot;
it sort of sounded like a whip .
and her tone changes .
when she says &quot; stop &quot; she sounds afraid ,
but then the rest is matter of fact .
so is she just pretending to be scared ?
she &apos;s asking for more money ,
so she could be being paid to be tortured .
what if she &apos;s a prostitute ?
this could be an s &amp; m scenario she was hired for .
this is where a pimp works ?
according to our local source ,
of all the pimps in town ,
this is the guy known for imported girls .
pare !
isso vai sair mais caro a voce .
do you know who she is ?
she &apos;s speaking brazilian portuguese
if that helps jog your memory .
what am i , rosetta stone ?
是解释古埃及象形文字的可靠线索
well , we have reason to believe she &apos;s a prostitute .
any of your girls , maybe from 15 years back , speak portuguese ?
i don &apos;t know who sent you guys ,
but you obviously got the wrong idea about me .
as you can plainly see , i &apos;m a ...
purveyor of fine meats .
no , leon , we were told that you run
a pretty lucrative business on the side .
now you &apos;re flattering me .
i make a mean barbecue sauce , but i don &apos;t make much money on it .
you know , i find it interesting
you haven &apos;t asked what any of this is about .
i have a dreadful lack of curiosity .
well , let me fill you in .
a child was murdered yesterday
and at his home they found blood on his front door .
pig &apos;s blood .
you know what ? it actually just occurred to me ,
but i feel like this is the sort of shop
you could find a lot of pig &apos;s blood .
oh , you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re not saying you had anything to do with this , leon .
but we are saying that the fbi is desperate for any leads ,
and it would be a shame
if we had to shut your shop down to collect dna samples
to try to identify the source of that pig &apos;s blood .
now , look .
i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about blood on a door .
but i think i do remember something about , uh ,
a couple of brazilian girls who used to work for a ...
an acquaintance of mine .
what were their names ?
raquel castro and luisa gomez .
raquel moved back to brazil in &apos; 95 .
what about luisa ?
that bitch ? she totally betrayed my buddy .
did she walk out on him ?
no . she married his best customer .
hi . can i help you ?
we &apos;re special agents rossi and morgan from the fbi .
we &apos;re looking for a marla golden .
who is it , holly ?
hello , ma &apos;am . are you marla golden ?
that &apos;s very tragic ,
but i don &apos;t know anything about these boys .
mrs. golden ,
we know that you &apos;re luisa gomez .
now , you can save us a whole lot of trouble
if you &apos;ll just come clean .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
ma &apos;am , these two boys are dead ,
and their parents are extremely devastated .
we have to find out who killed them .
you &apos;re a mother , too .
you have a child you left behind in brazil
that you &apos;re sending money to .
can you imagine how you would feel
if something terrible happened to renaldo ?
or holly ?
when i first came to this country ,
i did things i &apos;m not proud of .
but i had to survive .
did you ever do anything involving a child ?
no , i would never .
what about any s &amp; m ?
were you ever paid to be tortured ?
once a long time ago ,
there was a couple .
it was an american man ,
and his wife was from eastern europe or somewhere .
she was very petite .
the man wanted to torture us with whips and videotape it .
how bad was the torture ?
for me it was pretend .
i didn &apos;t let it get too far .
but his wife seemed really scared .
for her i think it was brutal .
the taffert house is quiet right now .
neighbors reported seeing malcolm and lida taffert
leave earlier today and they haven &apos;t returned .
there &apos;s still speculation
the tafferts can &apos;t be completely innocent
based on an exchange malcolm taffert had
with another reporter this afternoon .
are they still there ?
why won &apos;t they just leave us alone ?
because they are parasites .
andy didn &apos;t like this on him .
what ?
he didn &apos;t like this yellow jacket on his monkey .
you shouldn &apos;t have said anything to that reporter .
i wasn &apos;t going to stand by while they accused me
he was baiting you !
of doing horrible things to my own child !
what are you doing ? where are you going ?
to the drugstore . we need toothpaste .
you want me to go with you ?
no !
i--i just need some fresh air . ok ?
ok .
lida--
i &apos;m gonna get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
lida !
lida !
lida !
the door was open , the engine still running ,
and the car in park . no signs of a struggle .
so she stopped for someone voluntarily .
most likely somebody she knew , but she also would have stopped
for a police officer or somebody that was injured .
or someone masquerading as such .
the search needs to be expanded
to include anyone the tafferts had contact with
before the phone calls began .
malcolm taffert said they didn &apos;t tell anyone they were here .
then somebody must have followed them here ,
or the unsub found their location through some other means .
how &apos;s he doing ?
just as you &apos;d expect .
to switch from male child victims
to a female adult is highly unusual .
the last call went to malcolm &apos;s cell phone .
maybe this is personal , just like torturing richard clayvin
in the psychiatric unit was .
the fathers could be the real target of the unsub &apos;s rage .
outside of being caucasian males ,
the two fathers are pretty different .
malcolm taffert &apos;s upper middle class .
richard clayvin &apos;s a blue collar guy .
their hobbies are different as well .
malcolm is a wine collector .
richard likes fishing .
what about their wives ?
why was lida taffert kidnapped ,
but nothing happened to frankie clayvin &apos;s mother ?
she &apos;s a stepmom .
richard remarried before frankie was abducted .
his biological mom was already dead .
yeah , baby girl , i need you , boo .
always ready and eager to serve you .
i need the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on frankie clayvin &apos;s mother .
i &apos;ll have it in a mere 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 keystrokes away . ok .
frankie &apos;s birthmother &apos;s name was nadia ,
she &apos;s from romania ,
she had a history of depression
and ended up taking her own life .
romania .
didn &apos;t the former prostitute say
she had a sexual encounter with an american man
and an eastern european woman ?
well , could it have been frankie &apos;s parents ?
she said she was petite .
garcia , any idea how tall frankie &apos;s mother was ?
i &apos;m checking autopsy records now .
nadia was 5 &apos; 8 . &quot;
no , it wasn &apos;t her .
but there &apos;s gotta be a connection here somewhere .
nadia &apos;s romanian . lida taffert is polish .
then there &apos;s a third woman from 15 years ago
who &apos;s eastern european . maybe she &apos;s the unsub &apos;s mother .
well , that first call to the clayvins came
around the one @-@ year anniversary of nadia &apos;s death .
maybe the unsub &apos;s mother committed suicide as well .
bottom line , we need to figure out
who the mystery woman is .
there &apos;s a gps tracking app on malcolm &apos;s cell phone .
the unsub could have easily located the tafferts
at the motel through that .
go ahead , garcia .
i have got a list of eastern european women
around the memphis area
who committed suicide within the last 4 decades .
it &apos;s a short list . the most relevant name is olga milworth ,
who was from romania .
like nadia clayvin was .
yeah . she was married to an american
named charles milworth , and 19 years ago
she tried to kill herself and her son .
get this--her son survived .
what &apos;s his name ?
his name &apos;s daniel milworth ,
and he was incarcerated in arizona for 11 years
in a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane .
because he kidnapped and tortured a prostitute .
that would explain his dormancy period .
garcia , where is he now ?
uh , well , once he was released ,
it appears he vanished .
there &apos;s no record of him anywhere .
i &apos;m gonna take a guess he changed his identity .
you know this man ?
if you took away the beard and the glasses ,
he looks like andy &apos;s computer science teacher at school .
um ... burt solomon .
was andy close to him ?
he was one of his favorites .
i guess he lets the kids play video games in class .
that could be how andy was lured out .
午夜放到你的邮筒里
and why lida stopped for someone .
are you saying burt solomon did this ?
we can &apos;t say for sure , but we definitely need to talk to him .
as soon as we know anything , you &apos;ll be the first to know .
garcia , i need an address for burt solomon .
he &apos;s a teacher at andy taffert &apos;s school .
hello .
did you see what i did ?
did you see it ?
what the hell did you do to her ?
did you kill lida ? !
did you ? !
burt solomon &apos;s been teaching at andy &apos;s school for two years .
it fits the timeline . he &apos;s gotta be our unsub .
burt solomon , aka daniel milworth ,
probably bought a fake i.d.
and even fake teaching credentials .
what have you got , garcia ?
i &apos;ve got more information on daniel milworth .
according to prison psychiatric records ,
his mom was a romanian mail order bride .
his dad made her perform
demeaning sex acts with prostitutes
and then he forced young daniel to watch .
no !
stop ! stop !
if the mother spoke poor english and was unskilled ,
she probably felt trapped in her situation .
in her mind , killing herself and her son
was their only means of escape .
garcia , how did the mother die ?
uh , she drive a car into a lake .
daniel managed to break out a window and escape .
any idea how daniel milworth
crossed paths with the clayvins ?
yeah . he volunteered as a teacher &apos;s aide while he was in college ,
and one of the schools he happened to work at was frankie &apos;s .
seeing the american father / immigrant mother dynamic
must have amplified his negative feelings about his own family ,
especially after nadia clayvin committed suicide .
and after a stint in prison ,
he saw the same dynamic again
in andy taffert &apos;s parents .
but lida taffert didn &apos;t try to commit suicide .
no , she didn &apos;t have to .
he &apos;d killed once already and he saw the similarity
between his own parents and the tafferts
and he turned them into surrogates .
so he killed the boys
to rescue them from their fathers ,
just as he wished he had been saved .
then he may be trying to rescue lida taffert , too .
guys , a red alert . we &apos;ve got a trace
on the last call made to malcolm
taffert &apos;s cell and it seems to be sticking .
it &apos;s from a remote area
5.2 miles off of cold ridge road .
all right , we &apos;ll head there .
but he &apos;s good at rerouting calls ,
so let &apos;s split up .
dave , you go to burt solomon &apos;s house .
got it .
fbi !
clear ! clear !
all clear !
he &apos;s not here .
someone &apos;s been very busy here .
it &apos;s an angelfish for cloning phone numbers .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you .
did you see what i did ?
did you see it ?
i got you , didn &apos;t i ?
i told you i would get you .
good boy , danny !
he used this video to make the recordings .
i &apos;ll let the others know daniel milworth &apos;s not here .
all right , thanks , rossi . we &apos;ll keep a lookout for him .
this is it .
guys , i think he &apos;s near me .
quite the altar .
he definitely has a thing about mothers .
i may have something .
it &apos;s a decoy .
do you hear that ?
it &apos;s coming from behind here .
hey , guys , this is awful .
daniel &apos;s father didn &apos;t just make him watch
the sexual encounters , he made him videotape them .
daniel , are you getting this ?
it &apos;s a secret hallway connected to his bedroom .
lida taffert was inside .
&quot; we cannot despair of humanity ,
since we ourselves are human beings . &quot;
albert einstein .
if you don &apos;t want to be in the house ,
we could certainly take you to a friend or a relative &apos;s .
uh , no . lida wants to stay .
so do i.
we feel closer to andy here .
we understand .
and if there &apos;s anything at all that you need ,
please don &apos;t hesitate to call .
this will be a difficult time for you .
but you &apos;re not alone .
thank you .
