okay , gang .
tonight , the farewell to vhs festival continues .
it &apos;s been mighty cold in here since &quot; the big chill . &quot;
what say we warm our hearts by ...
&quot; st. elmo &apos;s fire &quot; ?
yes !
couple of wine coolers and some &apos; 80s rob lowe--
i can get into that .
i &apos;m still holding out hope i &apos;ll have plans tonight .
great . two for two . haley ?
oh , so fun , but i &apos;m gonna have to say no .
i have a photography @-@ class thing .
what kind of a thing ?
oh , you know , just an exhibit ,
like , to show our photos .
is it something that we should go to ?
claire , we just made plans .
mom , this is a college class .
i &apos;m not in the third grade .
don &apos;t you have nap time there ?
no . i have free periods ,
during which i sometimes nap .
is it me , or was she just being purposefully vague ?
alex , i want you to go through her stuff
and find out about this thing tonight .
wait , wait .
i @-@ i don &apos;t feel good about us snooping .
i know . that &apos;s why i told alex to do it .
i think haley knows more than she &apos;s letting on .
it breaks my heart how badly you want to believe that .
we &apos;ll see you guys later .
where are you going ?
riding our bikes to xander &apos;s .
what are you doing there ?
i don &apos;t know . hanging out .
sounds fun . wear your helmets .
we will .
i &apos;m not writing my first novel by blowing through a tube .
i don &apos;t like them going over to that kid &apos;s house .
why not ?
mm , xander &apos;s a bad influence .
his older brother is even worse .
huge stoner always walking around
in his army jacket with his muscles ,
flipping his hair out of his blue eyes .
he told me i was looking good one time .
i mean , come on .
yeah , we &apos;ll keep our eye on that .
but for now ... xander . i don &apos;t trust him .
claire , you &apos;re a tough one to figure out .
you don &apos;t trust bad boys , and yet you married one .
my handsome boy &apos;s so hungry .
all right . be back in a few .
if shorty calls , tell him i died ,
but make sure you really sell it .
it &apos;s a funny thing we &apos;re doing .
how is that funny ?
i knew you &apos;d say that .
just don &apos;t answer the phone . bye , buddy .
what &apos;s all that about ?
you mad at me or something ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you do something to make me mad ?
because then i am .
but if you didn &apos;t , then i am not .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
then i am not mad .
i am mad .
last night , jay had a sexy dream about some woman .
baby .
oh , baby .
oh , baby !
and i know it wasn &apos;t about me ,
because he knows that i hate when men call me baby .
and , yes , people are allowed their private thoughts ,
and i shouldn &apos;t be so angry ,
but i am latin , so i get to feel whatever i want .
you want to tell me what i did ?
do you want to tell me what you did ?
i don &apos;t know what i did .
then i don &apos;t know what you did .
i &apos;m bored . i &apos;m going .
don &apos;t forget your phone .
i got a bruise on my arm .
i don &apos;t know where it came from .
oh , poor baby .
and then i realized
i don &apos;t want to work for charlie anymore .
what i really want --
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t listen to this .
i need to tell you something ,
but you have to keep it a secret .
of course . i &apos;m a lawyer .
i &apos;ve heard murder confessions .
really ? - well , in --
in mock trials at law school .
but still , i never told anyone .
seriously , this is only for you .
you can &apos;t even tell cam . promise ?
uh , okay .
is everything all right ?
look under the table .
above the ankle , below the knee , what do you see ?
i &apos;m a little nervous about this , but --
oh , oh , my gosh ! you didn &apos;t ?
i did . calf implants .
wow , and you really went for it , didn &apos;t you ?
no , no , no . they &apos;re still swollen .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re wearing sweat pants .
okay , i was --
i was afraid you &apos;d just given up .
so , whew !
they &apos;ll settle .
i &apos;m gonna start casually referencing my new workout plan ,
and then i &apos;m gonna debut them
memorial day at laguna beach .
i personally don &apos;t think that you needed them ,
but if they make you happy --
they do .
good .
i always wanted to be
one of those guys running in tights ,
but i was too embarrassed about my legs .
well , if you &apos;d just gone running --
yep . you &apos;re overthinking this , mitchell .
no joke , you can &apos;t tell cam .
i love him , but he is a giant blabbermouth .
oh , come on . he &apos;s not that bad .
he just -- yeah , no , i can &apos;t even sell that .
jay , to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i &apos;m just here to pick up manny .
no need for a whole thing .
i don &apos;t know why i do that to him .
the guy &apos;s always so happy to see me .
i &apos;m not gonna worry about it .
manny &apos;s not here .
he actually went with luke over to xander &apos;s .
whoa ! manny didn &apos;t tell you he was going either ?
i told you , those boys are being cagey .
there is a chance
gloria let me drive over here for nothing as punishment .
i think she snooped on my phone ,
read some of my e @-@ mails .
that &apos;s not cool . e @-@ mails are private .
they were from a friend i loaned money to .
100 % your prerogative .
a woman .
oh , no .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;d do .
i &apos;d tell my lady ,
&quot; you got no business being in my business . &quot;
respect your man &apos;s boundaries .
honey , you promised
you &apos;d clean the pan if you made brownies .
well , maybe i forgot to spray it first
and i &apos;m letting it soak , woman .
he only talks like this when you &apos;re around .
well , then , he &apos;s done for the day .
oh , okay . good .
bye , dad .
see ya ... buddy .
i have tracked luke &apos;s cellphone ,
and he is nowhere near his friend xander &apos;s .
honey , i love technology as much as the next wozniak ,
but are we sure we want to be spying on our kids ?
no , and you also shouldn &apos;t try to friend us
with fake facebook profiles ,
margot lacroix .
i was really hoping some
of this would go away when you got a job .
how about i just ask him ?
oh , man .
i wish you were my dad .
the things i would have done .
hello ?
hey , buddy .
just making sure you got to xander &apos;s okay .
yep . all good .
really ? &apos; cause i hear traffic ...
... and xander lives on a pretty quiet street , right ?
actually , we left xander &apos;s ,
and now we &apos;re at sammy &apos;s .
well , that makes perfect sense .
you have fun . be safe .
he &apos;s lying .
look . his friend sammy lives here .
he &apos;s all the way over on olympic and 20th .
olympic and 20th ?
that &apos;s the old salvage yard
where kids go to get high .
what ? !
no .
oh , we are going there right now .
wait , wait , wait . are you sure ?
i &apos;m gonna answer , and then i &apos;m gonna walk away .
deal ?
okay .
i &apos;m 420 % sure .
wow , she &apos;s bad at math .
hey , guys .
hi , daddy .
how was lunch ?
oh , it was fine .
hey , when did salmon become a thing that we put on salad ?
2008 in the city , 2011 in the suburbs .
how was brett ? what &apos;s the drama du jour ?
nothing .
oh , please . it &apos;s never nothing with that one .
his perm , the stalker he pretends to have ,
nobody will date you when you work at the i.r.s.
i hate it . what was it this time ?
no , seriously , nothing .
i guess it is nice to have something other than chicken
to throw on there .
okay , why are you being so evasive ?
i &apos;m not being evasive . i--
check out this new tie .
oh , my gosh .
you are redirecting me ,
like we do when lily asks us a question
we don &apos;t want to answer
and just throw a doll in her face .
wait a minute .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
like i could do that with an adult .
check out what i got for you .
oh , good , yes . a garlic press .
i am so tired of my fingers smell--
oh , my gosh . you did it again .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s got to be good .
what ? !
tell me .
no , nothing .
tell me .
there &apos;s nothing to tell !
tell me .
there &apos;s nothing to tell !
tell me , tell me ,
tell me , tell me .
here . answer me .
how does santa claus get to all of those houses ?
okay , sweetie , the adults are talking right now ,
and look what daddy brought you .
mitchell , when somebody tells me something ,
i can &apos;t wait to get home and tell you .
don &apos;t you feel the same ?
of course i do .
but he -- he made me promise .
well , you know what ? we don &apos;t have to share secrets .
we don &apos;t .
we already share a house , a life ,
a daughter .
you know what ? i don &apos;t --
i don &apos;t know why i care so much .
okay , all right , okay .
he got calf implants .
oh , my god ! oh , what do they look like ?
like he &apos;s smuggling two grapefruits .
which , by the way , were also on my salad .
okay , this is huge . this is huge .
who all knows ? we have to host a brunch .
don &apos;t you dare tell a single person , okay ?
he made me promise not to tell anyone , especially you .
especially me ?
oh , please .
everybody knows you &apos;re terrible at keeping secrets .
okay , well , i didn &apos;t know that was my reputation .
maybe that &apos;s a secret people have been keeping from me .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt your feelings .
well , you did .
and you know what the sad thing is ?
we could be laughing at someone &apos;s calf implants right now .
hey , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just watching you sleep .
you look so pretty .
okay , but don &apos;t breathe so loud .
hey , where are you going ? !
i can &apos;t find a way in .
i can &apos;t see anything ,
but i hear them laughing .
and you know why kids laugh .
because their hearts are filled with joy , not suspicion ?
we have got to see what is going on in there .
get the drone thing out of the car .
that &quot; thing &quot; is a professional aerial @-@ photography tool
for real @-@ estate use only !
you used it at the beach to film yourself doing sand angels .
for my &quot; phil dunphy will get you
a heavenly deal on a beach house &quot; video .
a professional real @-@ estate tool !
that was the consensus .
hey , alex . what did you find out ?
okay , this is a bigger deal than haley let on .
only five people in her class
were picked to show their photographs ,
and haley was one of them .
amazing !
are there more than five people in the class ?
yes . that &apos;s the first thing i checked .
then we really do have to be there .
call uncle mitchell and grandpa and see if they can join us .
she didn &apos;t catch you snooping , did she ?
no . she &apos;s taking a nap .
she &apos;s been taking a lot more naps lately .
see what you can find out about that .
this is so wrong .
eh , well , desperate times call for desperate --
what is on your head ?
it provides glare protection , but apparently not from you .
let &apos;s just do this .
we are airborne .
expertly navigating the wires .
you &apos;re right .
we have cleared the wall . approaching target .
there they are .
what are they doing ?
they &apos;re jumping around on stuff .
do you see anything suspicious , like , um --
like smoke or paraphernalia , nachos ?
no , they &apos;re filming each other
and moving around like zombies .
honey , they &apos;re not getting high .
they &apos;re making a movie ... without me !
wait , wait , wait , wait .
then why would luke have lied
about going to sammy &apos;s , huh ?
honey , look .
oh , god .
well , he &apos;s still our little boy .
oh , we got to get out of here .
he cannot know we were spying on him .
come on .
too late .
it &apos;s too late . they &apos;re pointing at the drone .
what ?
we &apos;re compromised !
get out , get out !
i can &apos;t leave the drone !
it belongs to the office !
they &apos;re still mad at me for writing
on the dry @-@ erase board with a permanent marker !
get in the car .
go , go , go !
what was that thing ?
somebody was filming us .
hey , my dad has one of those .
i know what &apos;s going on here .
a movie studio is trying to steal our idea !
spielberg .
i told you guys , zombie parkour is a million @-@ dollar idea .
i still don &apos;t get it . zombies don &apos;t move well .
vampires , maybe .
plus , there &apos;s your title -- &quot; vam @-@ par @-@ kour . &quot;
i don &apos;t hear it .
look at that .
that &apos;s how i like to be greeted when i come home !
it turns out manny &apos;s hanging with his friends today ,
so i didn &apos;t need to go pick him up .
oh , right . so sorry . i forgot to tell you .
but , then , you don &apos;t tell me everything ,
so i guess it &apos;s okay .
you got a lot of nerve .
you are the one who went through my emails on my phone .
what are you talking about ? no , i didn &apos;t .
so you &apos;re not mad at me for something you found on my phone ?
no .
all right , then . great .
no harm , no foul .
i &apos;ll see you at dinner .
give me that phone !
i want to see what you &apos;re hiding !
i &apos;m not hiding anything .
i don &apos;t even know how to use the damn thing .
oh , look . i accidentally dialed alex .
let me say hi to her . the kid idolizes me .
hi , hon .
hi , grandpa .
real quick , how do i delete e @-@ mails on my phone ?
well , first , you have to check your inbox ,
your trash folder , and your sent folder .
people often forget about the sent folder .
trust me , you get pretty adept at this
when you have to stay one step
ahead of your snooping mother .
give me the phone .
got to go .
uh , yeah , sure . i @-@ i @-@ i have nothing on here .
let me just disconnect from grandpa ,
which is not happening right now .
i can see what you &apos;re doing , alex .
why did just delete a text from uncle mitchell ?
i didn &apos;t !
shouldn &apos;t you be more worried
that haley has a nurse &apos;s uniform in her closet ? !
i can only handle one thing at a time .
hey , claire .
hey , mitchell .
why would alex delete a text from you off her phone ?
i &apos;m not answering that question .
people &apos;s phones are their own business .
what ?
i got to go . give me your phone .
no . why ?
because you &apos;re texting someone
and you look very guilty right now .
or i &apos;m playing &quot; words with friends &quot;
with longines .
none of those words better be &quot; calf &quot; or &quot; implants . &quot;
oh , my gosh . here . you know what ?
take my phone ...
and admit that you don &apos;t trust me ,
your fiance , and co @-@ father of your daughter .
go ahead .
push the button .
i &apos;m good . no , i &apos;m fine . i trust you .
oh , my gosh !
hey , guys .
you want some red stuff that reminds you of wine ?
sure .
yep , i do .
so , when &apos;s this exhibit open ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe the details are in jay &apos;s phone .
but i hope not ,
because everything is very secret on there .
don &apos;t know if you caught that subtle cue .
she &apos;s mad at me .
he did something very terrible
that he doesn &apos;t want me to know about .
&quot; very terrible &quot; ?
until you tell me what it is ,
i &apos;m gonna think the worst possible thing ,
like maybe you killed somebody .
but you don &apos;t have the stomach for that , do you ?
thank you so much for coming .
i know how busy you all are with work and errands
and snarking about me on your cellphone .
let it go , claire .
honestly , phil , i don &apos;t know how you do it .
i don &apos;t know how you do it .
compromise and compassion .
she wasn &apos;t really asking you .
hey , hey ! here comes luke .
what do we say we were doing today ?
when has luke ever showed any interest in what we do ?
okay , but be cool .
if he finds out you were tracking his phone ,
he &apos;ll think we don &apos;t trust him .
ooh . plus , then i could never do it again .
hey , guys !
what &apos;s up ?
how was your day ?
it was fine , you know .
we don &apos;t know . how would we know ?
oh , we just mean what did you do ?
not like , what did you do ?
and we &apos;re just like , &quot; hey , what -- what &apos;d you do ? &quot;
you guys are acting weird .
no , we &apos;re not . you are .
what did you do today ?
we just stayed home
we went shopping .
online shopping at home for pants .
we both needed pants .
i told you he was gonna ask .
wait a minute .
was that your drone today ?
were you spying on us ?
i &apos;m sorry . your mom made me do it .
she thought you were smoking grass .
grass ? claire .
no one says grass .
i never said grass .
it &apos;s not that crazy an idea .
we weren &apos;t smoking anything .
manny would never .
thank you , mom .
he &apos;s so judgy about those things .
the only reason why i walk that stupid dog
is so that i can smoke my cigars in peace .
i can &apos;t believe you were spying on us .
you have to stop being so suspicious , claire .
it &apos;s okay to trust people .
some people . other people , who knows ?
you turn your back for one second ,
and they have a whole other family
on the bad side of town .
you are my other family from the bad side of town .
look , i can &apos;t stand this all night .
i loaned someone money , gloria .
i didn &apos;t consult you . i knew you &apos;d be pissed .
she &apos;s just a friend .
&quot; she &quot; ?
is this the woman
that you &apos;ve been dreaming about at night ,
that you &apos;ve been making the sexy noises and saying ,
&quot; baby , baby &quot; ?
what the hell are you talking about ? ! no ? !
then prove it ! give me the phone !
honestly , you people --
and by that , i mean straight people are ridiculous !
everyone &apos;s entitled to a little bit of privacy .
says the guy who forced me to
tell him our friend &apos;s secret .
okay , that &apos;s different .
that was gossip ,
and gossip belongs to everyone .
okay .
just keep your nose out of other people &apos;s phones .
you either trust them or you don &apos;t .
give me that .
ha ! yes . - give it back . give it --
no , but you can have mine ,
&apos;cause i have nothing to hide .
i &apos;ll take that .
oh , my god . mom , no , please , stop .
here , here . wait . let me help you .
it &apos;s crazy , right ?
ha ha . no , i knew it .
&quot; l.o.l.
do you think brett likes his coffee black
or with calf @-@ and @-@ calf ? &quot;
okay , i admit it . i have a problem .
but i only told one person . it was too juicy .
and crispin said he wouldn &apos;t tell anyone .
this is from longines .
oh , that lying crispin . give me that .
i cannot believe he betrayed my trust .
now pepper &apos;s chiming in .
jackals , all of them .
oh , that pepper .
oh , my g--
uncle mitchell was helping you get me a birthday present ?
yeah , i wanted to make you dinner
and get you a nice bottle of wine ,
the one he served at new year &apos;s
you said you liked .
ooh , i did like that wine .
i &apos;m sorry i ruined the surprise .
you should be .
what did you think i was doing , anyways ?
give me some credit .
oh , well , then , maybe we could just call it even ,
since he typed , &quot; i &apos;m just surprised
she remembered coming to my house that night . &quot;
to which you responded , &quot; bahahahahahaha &quot;
with like five exclamation points .
seems fair .
did you find what you were looking for ?
no .
she &apos;s a waitress at the club .
her boyfriend crashed her car , so i helped her ,
because we have that fun game where i order salad
and she brings me french fries .
but i never dreamt of her .
last night , i had a nightmare .
joe got out onto a ledge of a tall building .
i couldn &apos;t get to him .
i was very upset ,
and i think i might have cried a little in my sleep ,
which might have sounded like sex to you ,
which i don &apos;t love .
but that &apos;s the &quot; baby &quot; i was talking about .
really ?
that &apos;s scary .
yes !
why in god &apos;s name
would i need to dream about another woman ?
now that you say it out loud ,
it does seem kind of crazy .
i &apos;m not proud of this , but the dream wasn &apos;t about joe .
it was about this little baby right here .
that &apos;s right .
you almost fell off a ledge , and daddy was so scared .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s us !
all over the place .
i don &apos;t know how i feel about this .
okay , okay , now , see -- look how much you gossip .
haley managed to capture it on film .
and look at you , smiling ear to ear .
you know you love it when i give you the dirt .
oh , which reminds me ,
guess who got kicked out of a hotel bar
for making unwanted advances at the waitstaff ?
i don &apos;t want to know . it &apos;s none of my business .
okay .
jotham . zaniel . sal .
just tell me !
i don &apos;t know .
good god , look at those lines on my face .
when did i get so old ?
their smile lines because you &apos;re holding your son
who you love , who you had to protect in your dream .
she is a great photographer ,
even though it &apos;s embarrassing
that everyone &apos;s staring at my six @-@ pack .
she is really good .
have you seen my photo ?
has gloria seen this ?
gloria see what ?
i think i look good .
wow . she didn &apos;t even see me in there .
oh , my god ! what are you guys doing here ? !
alex invited us .
you ? how did you know where this was ?
uh , the flier fell out of your backpack .
liar .
mom made me .
we came to be supportive .
i told you not to come here . this is such a violation !
she just did it to me , too .
she read my texts .
that &apos;s nothing .
she totally used a drone to spy on me .
use of the drone was completely justified .
what is wrong with you ? !
what are you talking about ?
all right , knock it off .
you have no idea how hard it is to be a parent ,
to figure out what &apos;s going on with your kid
when all you get is a grunt or a &quot; fine &quot;
or a flick of the hair .
it &apos;s my job to protect you
and make sure you &apos;re making good choices .
and if i step over the line every now and again
when i &apos;m doing that , tough .
knowing you &apos;re safe is the only thing
that lets me sleep at night .
i thought it was the wine .
congratulations , haley .
for what ?
someone just bought your photo
of this beautiful lady .
first one sold .
oh , my god !
someone paid for something that i made ! me !
i am so psyched we were here for this !
me too !
now you &apos;re glad we &apos;re here , huh ?
i got to admit ,
that &apos;s a gorgeous picture of you .
