&apos;cause every time i see your face
i can &apos;t help but fall from grace
this girl &apos;s good .
yeah , a song with rhyming words ! i never thought of that before .
i like her .
why ? because she can both sing and play guitar at the same time ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m looking for from these people .
look at you , all jealous .
come on , pheebs . you two have completely different styles .
she &apos;s more .... you know ?
and you &apos;re more ....
say you &apos;ll stay beside me
see ? everybody else is happy she &apos;s done .
okay , my next song &apos;s called :
&quot; phoebe buffay , what can i say ? i loved when we were ...
... singing partners and i shouldn &apos;t have left you that way . &quot;
one of those &quot; look for the hidden meaning &quot; songs .
the one with phoebe &apos;s ex @-@ partner
hey , phoebe .
hey , leslie .
how &apos;d you know i &apos;d be here ?
i saw vlad at the place where they sell the big fish .
he said you played here a lot , so ....
i have to go to the bathroom .
if &quot; big @-@ fish place &quot; comes up again ...
... i &apos;d like to know if that &apos;s several big fish or just one big fish .
so phoebe says you write jingles .
actually , i said she abandoned me to write jingles .
anything we might &apos;ve heard of ?
home is never far away
home is homestar stew .
but i don &apos;t do that anymore . i got kind of sick of it .
and then i couldn &apos;t come up with anything good , so they fired me .
bummer .
well , you know , i was just ....
i was just thinking and just hoping that ...
... maybe you &apos;d want to get back together ?
no , but , thanks .
come on , phoebe . would you just think about it ?
no , but , thanks .
see you , pheebs .
that was kind of brutal .
let this be a lesson to all of you .
once you betray me , i become like the lce woman .
i &apos;m just very cold , hard , unyielding .
you know , nothing can penetrate this icy exterior .
can i have a tissue ?
is someone in there ?
i &apos;m playing a daredevil game ...
... called &quot; wait until the last moment before i burst and die . &quot;
jeez , man ! did you fall ?
hi !
so did you ? did you fall high ?
someone was in the ladies &apos; room . i couldn &apos;t wait .
i left the lid up for you , though .
you know what , gunther ? go ahead .
i &apos;m talking to ....
this is where you say your name .
ginger .
ginger . i &apos;m talking to ginger , so ...
don &apos;t you have to use the bathroom ?
no , i just i &apos;d rather talk to you .
yes , i do .
yes , i do have to go to the bathroom .
there &apos;s someone in here .
where &apos;s chandler ?
he can &apos;t make it .
he said he had to go back to his job and

joey tribbiani ?
i can see you , okay ?
you &apos;re hiding behind the coats .

hi .
hi , sweetie .
hello .
hey , ross .
i &apos;ve got some bad news .
what ?
i can eat , but i have to come back here .
come on . you &apos;ve worked late every night for two weeks .
what is it now ?
it &apos;s my fault . i quit today .
but work comes first !
but that &apos;s sad about you , though . what happened ?
what happened ? burn out ? burn all out , did you ?
he &apos;s leaving for a better job .
that &apos;s great . so i guess this is goodbye then .
goodbye .
okay , then .
well , we &apos;re gonna miss you around here .
yeah , me too .
so see you on saturday .
yeah , you bet !
now , you know those are a delicacy in lndia .
that was leslie calling to see if we can get back together .
it &apos;s like the 20th time today . yeah , good luck , leslie .
she must &apos;ve hurt you bad .
well , yeah . you know , we were best friends ...
... ever since we were little . our moms worked on the barge together .
you two must &apos;ve been so cute , running around on a barge .
you never run on a barge !
is chandler around ?
he met some girl at the coffeehouse .
ginger something .
sure it wasn &apos;t something that sounded liked ginger ? like &quot; gingeer &quot; ?
no , it was ginger .
i remember because when he told me , i said :
the movie star
oh , man !
that &apos;s the girl i was hiding from .
when she sees he &apos;s my roommate , she &apos;ll tell him what i did .
what did you do ?
oh , no ! i can &apos;t ....
i can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s the most awful thing i &apos;ve ever done .
you &apos;re really not making us want to hear it less .
don &apos;t tell us .
we &apos;ll wait till chandler gets home . it &apos;ll be more fun that way .
it was , like , four years ago .
ginger and i had gone out a few times . then one weekend ...
... we went to her dad &apos;s cabin ...
... just me , her and her annoying little dog , pepper .
that night i cooked this really romantic dinner
you gave her food poisoning !
i wish .
after dinner , me , her and pepper fell asleep in front of the fire .
i woke up in the middle of the night and saw the fire was dying out ...
... so i picked up a log and threw it on .
or what i thought was a log .
oh , my god ! you threw pepper on the fire !
i wish .
another thing i probably should &apos;ve told you about ginger ...
... is that she kind of has a ...
... artificial leg .
oh , my god !
you threw it on the fire ?
she must &apos;ve freaked out .
yeah , she must &apos;ve .
you don &apos;t know ?
well ....
what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire ?
i ran !
you ran ?
through the woods , with no socks on .
that &apos;s the best kiss i &apos;ve had ...
... with anybody i met in a men &apos;s room .
actually , me too .
foot all in the puddle !
damn ! i hate that !
you &apos;ll have to get out of those shoes .
don &apos;t worry .
no , really . you &apos;re gonna freeze .
no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re not ? have you got a bionic foot ?
someday . maybe .
funny book ?
i &apos;m just thinking about something funny i heard today .
mark saying , &quot; i &apos;ll see you saturday . &quot;
yeah , at the lecture .
i told you last week . you said you didn &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s not the lecture i mind .
please tell me it &apos;s not because i &apos;m going with mark .
well
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry , but if you &apos;re not working with him anymore ...
... why do you still hang out ?
because he &apos;s my friend .
but do you really need another &quot; friend &quot; ?
if i stop playing with joey and chandler , can i play with mark ?
is that funny ? am i suppose to be laughing ?
i don &apos;t know . you thought &quot; see you saturday &quot; was funny .
mark is in fashion .
i like having a friend i can share this stuff with .
you guys would never go to a lecture with me .
i &apos;d love to go with you .
really ?
i have clothes .
i even pick them out .
for all you know , i could be a fashion ...
... monger .
i would love for you to go with me .
what ?
what should i wear ? now i &apos;m all nervous .
you know , they say &quot; a watched pot never beeps . &quot;
it &apos;s been a couple hours ...
... and she hasn &apos;t called .
not that i even care . i don &apos;t .
why don &apos;t you just call her ?
you obviously want to .
you think you know me so well .
well , don &apos;t you wanna ?
so i do know you .
that &apos;s what i said .
well , so ?
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t . she dumped me .
i totally trusted her , then one day it was like :
&quot; okay , bye , pheebs . &quot; gone !
you know what the saddest part is ?
when we were playing together , that was ...
... the most fun i &apos;ve ever had in all my lives .
my favorite shoes , so good to me i wear them every day
down at the heel , holes in the toes don &apos;t care what people say
my feet &apos;s best friend pals to the end
with them , i &apos;m one hot chickie
though late one night not much light
i stepped in something icky
sticky shoes , sticky shoes
always make me smile
sticky shoes , sticky shoes next time i &apos;ll ...
... avoid the ...
... pile !
we &apos;re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colors .
for instance , a sheer navy blouse over a pink ....
i &apos;m really glad we came .
you &apos;re so pretty .
i love you .
smelly cat , smelly cat
what are they feeding you ?
smelly cat , smelly cat
it &apos;s not your fault
that &apos;s great !
you know , you could totally sell this .
it &apos;d be perfect for , like , a kitty @-@ litter campaign .
a jingle ?
why not ? you &apos;d make a ton of money .
if i was in this for the money , i &apos;d be a millionaire by now .
you gotta get out of that jingle @-@ head .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna play a song now that &apos;s really , really sad .
it &apos;s called &quot; magician box mix @-@ up . &quot;
oversized bracelets , oversized earrings ...
... oversizing of accessories , in general , is very popular now .
can i borrow this ? my milk &apos;s gone bad .
i hate that .
i once had a thing of half @-@ and @-@ half . stole my car .
so how was your date with ginger ?
great .
it was great . she &apos;s ....
she &apos;s great . great looks and personality . greatness .
sounds like she &apos;s got the ...
... whole package .
so she &apos;s got it all , huh ?
she &apos;s the real deal ?
joey told you about the leg , huh ?
oh , god ! it freaked me out .
it shouldn &apos;t , but it did .
i wanna keep seeing her , but it &apos;s like :
&quot; hey , you know what ? where &apos;s your leg ? &quot;
i &apos;m the smallest person in the world , aren &apos;t l ?
morning .
actually , he &apos;s the smallest person in the world .
heard about the leg @-@ burning , huh ?
it came up .
listen , i know it &apos;s a long shot , but ...
... by any chance , did she find that funny ?
so i nodded off a little !
&quot; nodded off &quot; ? ross , you were snoring !
my father &apos;s boat didn &apos;t make that much noise when it hit rocks !
come on ! forty @-@ five minutes ....
forty @-@ five minutes , the man talked about strappy @-@ backed dresses .
okay , how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium ...
... iistening to professor &quot; pitstains &quot; say :
&quot; remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago ?
well , here &apos;s a little bone we didn &apos;t know it had ! &quot;
first of all , it &apos;s professor pitain .
and second of all , that little bone proved that ...
... that particular dinosaur had wings but didn &apos;t fly .
okay , you know what i just heard ?
a hundred million people went to see a movie about what i do .
i wonder how many people would go see a movie called jurassic parka .
oh , that is so
a bunch of out @-@ of @-@ control jackets take over an island !
if what i do is so lame ...
... then why did you insist on coming with me this morning ?
was it so i just wouldn &apos;t go with mark ?
i wanted to be with you .
i don &apos;t know , i feel like lately ...
... you &apos;re slipping away from me ...
... with this new job and all these new people .
and you &apos;ve got this whole other life going on .
i know it &apos;s dumb ...
... but i just hate that i &apos;m not a part of it .
it &apos;s not dumb .
but maybe it &apos;s okay that you &apos;re not a part of it .
you know what i mean ?
i mean , it &apos;s like ...
... i like that you &apos;re not involved in that part of my life .
that &apos;s a little clearer .
see , it doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t love you ...
... because i do . i love you so much .
but my work it &apos;s for me , you know ?
i &apos;m out there on my own , and i &apos;m doing it .
and it &apos;s scary , but i love it because it &apos;s mine .
but i mean , is that okay ?
sure .
you &apos;re thinking about my leg .
actually , i forgot . what &apos;s the deal with that again ?
look , it &apos;s okay if it bothers you .
i only need to know how much it bothers you ...
... because i don &apos;t like wasting my time .
am i wasting my time ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s like anything else . you just have to get used to it .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s my &quot; nubbin . &quot;
what &apos;s a nubbin ?
it &apos;s kind of a third @-@ nipple kind of thing .
you have three nipples ?
well , you know , two regulars ...
... and one that barely qualifies as a
what ?
nothing . you know , l ....
i just remembered . i have to leave .
you have to leave ? now ? how come ?
well , it &apos;s nubbin . nothing !
you know what ? i &apos;ll see you later .
i thought you weren &apos;t coming .
where were you ?
come here , come here .
don &apos;t get mad , okay ?
don &apos;t give me a reason to get mad , okay ?
i played smelly cat for my old ad agency . they went nuts !
i told you i didn &apos;t want you to try and sell it ...
... and you just big , fat did it anyway !
i think , five years ago , i probably would have done anything ...
... to play with you .
but i can do it myself . if i can &apos;t trust you , then forget it .
i don &apos;t wanna forget it .
you know what ? you have to choose .
if the most important thing on the planet to you ...
... is this cat @-@ poopy thing , then you can have smelly cat .
but we won &apos;t be partners .
so what &apos;s it gonna be ?
smelly cat , smelly cat
problem odor in the litter box ?
don &apos;t change your kitty , change your kitty litter .
it &apos;s not your fault
sorry , pheebs .
you okay ?
i actually am .
because , you know , life &apos;s gonna hand you all kinds of stuff .
you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow .
you wanna hear a new song ?
we &apos;d love to .
jingle bitch screwed me over
go to hell , jingle whore
go to hell , go to hell , go to hell
that &apos;s all i have so far .
well , hello !

the source of all my powers .
