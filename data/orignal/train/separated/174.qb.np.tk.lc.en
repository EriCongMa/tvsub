gossip girl here--
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you will find your place. just give it time .
no , i found my place , and it &apos;s at the bottom .
i cannot believe you told vanessa to take professor rifkin .
i @-@ i &apos;m at a party . i really don &apos;t feel like taking a test right now .
well , if your family can accept us together ,
maybe one day mine will , too .
i &apos;m opening a restaurant .
but downstairs , he &apos;s creating a club
you wanted to ruin my deal ,
so you came here and brought carter baizen as your wingman .
and i don &apos;t want anyone else .
i want you .
mm. no , you know , i &apos;m still a little wrecked ,
so , uh , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll call you later .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
morning in new york time to wake up from bad dreams ,
roll out of the beds we &apos;ve made and start making plans
for a brighter future .
chuck , it &apos;s me . i know this sounds scheduly ,
but with you focused on making
your market and business world ,
and me focused on ...
point being , i just got t of my first class ,
and i was thinking if i skipped french history ,
we might have enough time to squeeze in
a mid @-@ morning renaissance before lunch .
aah !
ew ! ew ! ew !
i &apos;m wearing a glove , and i still want to wash my hands !
hey , roomie . dan was just ...
i was , i was just , i was getting
a book that i need .
it &apos;s er &quot; our body ourselves a new edition for a new era . &quot;
that &apos;s excellent .
no , i know what this is ,
and don &apos;t think that you can run me out
of my own room with a half @-@ naked dan humphrey .
fine , stay . maybe you &apos;ll learn something .
no , that &apos;s okay .
i was just about to hit the trail , you know ?
it just so happens i &apos;m on my way
to a very important breakfast
i just stopped by to drop off my books and pick up my mail .
so feel free to hit the trail all you want .
from serena to georgina ? quite a fall , even for you .
don &apos;t worry about blair .
i knew she &apos;d have a problem with us .
but i think vanessa &apos;s gonna be supportive .
and serena and jenny ,
your dad .
hey , i &apos;m starved . want to grab breakfast ?
um , you know what ?
i gotta be somewhere , but , uh , rain check ?
sure. no biggie .
thanks .
dan ?
what ? oh , of coue .
did i just catch you on a walk of shame ?
no. no. no , don &apos;t be silly .
i was visiting , uh , uh , vanessa .
she &apos;s on this new chinese feng shui kick ,
and she makes you take your shoes off when you ...
yeah , it &apos;s weird .
i thought i heard your voices .
what &apos;s going on ?
i was looking for blair &apos;s room ,
and dan here claims he was visiting you .
but if that &apos;s vanessa &apos;s room , then where ...
please tell it was blair and not georgina .
please tell me it was not georgina .
i don &apos;t want talk about this right now , in the hallway ...
or ever. never would also be good . i would like that .
i just mean that when you do something no one knows about ,
it &apos;s kind of like you &apos;re not really doing it .
but when someone finds out about it ...
it becomes real .
yeah .
well , college is time for experimentation ,
psychedelic drugs , ethnic food ...
girls who once pretended to be seraph from portland
okay , so , so , uh , you guys are what ?
we &apos;re just going to tease you mercilessly .
but without judgment , &apos; cause who doesn &apos;t have
a georgina in their closet , right ?
right .
okay . i was coming to see blair ,
but now that she &apos;s not here , uh ,
you want to button up and come with me , tiger ?
i &apos;ll come with you .
scott has his comp theory seminar in the mornings ,
and , um , i &apos;m gonna try to catch him for coffee .
oh , i thought the , uh conference
was in the afternoon . georgina &apos;s friend just kept talking
about how hard it was to get in .
i completely forgot
how much reading i have to do for class ,
so i &apos;m , i &apos;m just gonna catch up with you guys later.- okay .
vanessa , hey .
hey , how was , um , comp theory ?
nonstop excitement , lots of theories .
yeah , i just ran into dan , and he thought the seminars were
in the afternoons or something .
yeah , the seminars are ,
but the study groups are in the mornings .
then why don &apos;t i swing by ,
and we can grab a cup of coffee ?
i &apos;d love to. it &apos;s just , um ,
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
i &apos;ll call you later .
yeah. bye .
vanessa says hi .
did you tell her you were a natural ?
one week of guitar lessons ,
you got all the major chords .
thanks again , and i &apos;ve always wanted to learn .
i just figured i &apos;d take a shot to
from one of the greats .
well , i don &apos;t know about one of the &quot; greats . &quot;
maybe one of the &quot; pretty goods . &quot;
all right. here we go .
actually been meaning to talk to you about something .
me , too .
you know , vanessa &apos;s like a daughter to me , and ...
not to slip into after @-@ school special territory ,
but i just wanted to , uh , make sure
don &apos;t worry. vanessa , i love her a lot .
i do. it &apos;s just , um , i hope everything works out .
why wouldn &apos;t it ?
hey , scott. dad , uh , you excited about the auction tonight ?
uh , lily has a photo for sale
at the charity auction at sotheby &apos;s .
i &apos;m gonna go and check out the competition. oh , wow .
&apos;72 boys is a dead rain offically here
you know , i should , um , i should probably take off .
but i thought you wanted to talk .
oh , it can wait .
maybe next time we jam , is wednesday still good ?
see you then .
all right .
dad , scott &apos;s been spending a lot of time here lately .
yeah , he &apos;s a good kid. good guitar player , too .
so you &apos;re being pretty open @-@ minded about this georgina thing .
well , maybe it &apos;s because since i started dating carter ,
i have never been more pleasantly surprised .
oh , so y &apos;re--you &apos;re now dating carter baizen ?
is it because chuck isn &apos;t currently available ?
he &apos;s not like chuck anymore ,
which is why i &apos;m saying , if you want to date georgina ,
then more power to you .
i would just check to make sure there &apos;s not an ice pick under the bed .
we &apos;re not dating .
we are , uh , we &apos;re just hanging out
then piece of advice ? you should make sure she knows that .
&apos;cause if georgina likes somebody ,
she will go from zero to crazy before you know it .
good luck .
thanks. you , too .
hey. why are we meeting downtown ?
what &apos;s the big surprise ?
i &apos;ve been staying at the downing .
what do you say to a weekend of room service and whtie fluffy robes ?
can you afford a hotel ?
i thought your parents cut you off .
when there &apos;s a white fluffy , there is a way
unless you have plans tonight .
well , not me , but maybe we ?
there &apos;s this family thing tonight .
it &apos;s an auction , but i thought may--
carter ? aubrey .
we met at brandy library last month .
you have no idea who i am , do you ?
no , but probably because
i wasn &apos;t at the brandy library last month .
oh , okay .
so i guess i had sex with another carter baizen
who drinks his single malt with one ice cube
and claimed to be leaving with the peace corps the next day .
sounds like a charming fellow .
mistaken identity ?
obviously. you know i take my scotch neat .
i have no idea who that woman is , serena .
that &apos;s--hey , that--that &apos;s not me anymore .
okay .
what about tonight ? you were gonna ask me something ?
uh , you know what ? it was ... it was nothing .
i ... i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll call you later .
scott adler--
i just need to know if he &apos;s in comp theory .
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re not allowed to give out students &apos; class schedules .
when faced with an uncertain future ,
the questions we truly hate to ask
are the ones we fear we already know the answer to .
at if he &apos;s not a student ? i don &apos;t need his schedule .
i just need to know that he actually goes here. please .
my last boyfriend told me his dad invented the battery .
i &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s no record of a scott adler in our system .
i recommended a hot apple cider caramel .
on what ?
surprise me .
mmm .
you are amazing .
mmm .
but look ,
i , uh ,
i have a really big meeting in a few hours .
a few hours is hours from now .
seriously .
it &apos;s important. i have to keep my ... focus .
it with sean macpherson .
i &apos;m only gonna get one shot with him .
as opposed to me , who &apos;s just some endless font of do @-@ over
look , i &apos;ll make it up to you .
where are you going ?
no idea. i officially have nowhere left to go .
my roommate is a nympho with a socfetish ,
i have no friends at school ,
and now my boyfriend would rather obsess about a restaurateur
than spend quality time with me--
and hasn &apos;t , by the way , in five days .
in biblical times , destiny was delivered
in the form of stone tablets or a burning bush .
but today , true destiny is often engraved
and carries an embossed seal .
you &apos;ve been invited to la table elitaire good luck
oh ... my ... god .
serena ? you won &apos;t believe what i just got .
i got that. hi. hey. how &apos;s it going ? hi
hey .
oh , hey .

i was just , uh , i @-@ i-
i wanted to talk to you about us .
no @-@ not us us .
it &apos;s , uh , look , here &apos;s the thing .
i wasn &apos;t in love with you .
but i just want to make sure you &apos;re not misunderstanding

hanging out like we do .
if you want me to leave , i can understand. uh ...

yeah. how was i ?
yore adorable .
come on. i was heading out for pizza .
don &apos;t worry. no strings .
yeah , ay. yeah , yeah. i like--i like pizza .
that was easy .
la table elitaire ?
the elite table. how have you not heard of them ?
it &apos;s a secret society .
if i had heard of it , it wouldn &apos;t be a secret .
they &apos;re modeled after the grandes de coles in france .
secret salons for the elit of academic institutions .
finally something exclusive to strive for ,
something worthy all my pent @-@ up energy and attention .
so i take it you and chuck still havet--
no , and if he wants to focus on something
other than us , so can i .
you know , in a way , i blame all this on you .
me ?
yes. well , he told me about
how you killed his speak &apos;s plan lasteek ,
and hanging out with carter baizen ...
l @-@ listen to me. s .
listen very carefully .
you &apos;re not going to brown .
you &apos;re scared to tell your mom .
you &apos;re in free fall .
enter carter baizen .
i get it. lieve me .
but you need to pull this chute before splat !
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not like that .
he &apos;s different with me .
he actually knows me .
and who are you trying to convince , me or you ?
carter , i wanted to invite you
to the sotheby &apos;s auction with me tonight .
call me back and let me know that you can come .
i &apos;ll talk to you later. bye .
guys like carter don &apos;t change , s .

they &apos;ve given me my initiation instructions .
this is it . i gotta go .
oh , and you really are making a huge mistake. bye !
chuck bass for mr. macpherson .
i apologize , bute &apos;s going to have to reschedule .
it &apos;s devyn , right ?
we spoke earlier .
you &apos;re , uh , far more beautiful than i pictured .
i have mba from tuck .
i &apos;m not the coat check girl .
well , then i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware
his club on 63rd isn &apos;t doing as well as it could .
uptown isn &apos;t downtown .
i have some ideas he should hear
we get dozens of young guys a week
pitching sean their vision of the future .
that dsn &apos;t mean he wants to hear it .
i can be very persuasive .
so were they .
piece of advice ?
you really want him to take you seriously ?
find a way to show him that you respect his past .
at least then you &apos;ll have a shot .
i just can &apos;t believe
your parents still haven &apos;t returned your phone calls .
or e @-@ mails or texts .
i even wrote on
my dad &apos;s facebook wall .
what do you want to do tonight ?
well , as much as i enjoy the low profile thing , it &apos;be nice
to at least go somewhere that has a cash register , maybe .
you mean actually go out together
be seen by other people ?
well , yeah. i would like you to meet some of my friends .
if they remember who you are .
i held you captive for quite a while .
ah , but not enough
all right. let me see what everyone &apos;s doing tonight .
we &apos;ll make our public debut .
if your family finds out doesn &apos;t like it ...
maybe they &apos;ll call and complain .
chuck ?
how did you know i was here ?
did you find me to apologize ?
that is so sweet .
not exactly , though i am sorry .
i know i &apos;ve been all work lately
mmm. if you didn &apos;t find me
what are you doing here ?
there &apos;s a photograph i need that &apos;s up for auction tonight .
me , too. my prayers have been answered .
a secret collegiate society wants me .
initiation is easy .
all you have to do is contribute
to their salon &apos;s collectionas a fee , so
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
m more of a helmut newton girl myself ,
but they want vintage mcmullan .
who am i to argue ?
you see the guy in this photo ?
that &apos;s sean macpherson .
he has an entire wall
with photos like this in his office .
look , procuring this one for him
is the best way i can show him i
have respect for his history .
show him respect ?
he &apos;s a club owner
not a mafia don .
look , you can buy your &quot; table &quot; people
a wonderful nry diltz .
le table elitaire .
i only have until midnight tonight .
this is what they asked for .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but i need this .
well , you &apos;re not getting it ...
or anything else , i might add .
i got your message. what &apos;s up ?
i like you ...
i like you , too .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna give you 30 seconds to explain
why there &apos;s no scott adler
enlled at n.y.u.
look , vanessa , it &apos;s complicated .
let me make it easy for you .
you either tell me the truth ,
or we &apos;re over .
i lied to you because i had to .
that &apos;s not good enough .
they say honesty is a best policy ...
my name is ...
ny name isn &apos;t adler. it &apos;s rosson .
i &apos;m rufus and lily &apos;s son .
oh , my god .
i hope everyone &apos;s policies are paid up ,
because it looks like we &apos;re on a collision course .
my parents told me
i was adopted in middle school ,
but it wasn &apos;t until this past spring that i decided
to find my biological parents .
and when i told my folks of my intentions ,
they said that they &apos;d already
spoken with them ,
and they wanted nothing to do with me
they lied .
rufus and lily went looking for you ,
and your parents said that you were dead .
wait. what ?
yeah. they said you were killed in a boating accident .
that was my younger brother andrew .
why would my parents tell them that ?
i don &apos;t know , but you ...
need to tell rufus who you are .
i need to talk to my parents first .
it &apos;s been 20 years .
what &apos;s a day or two more ?
if you have any feelings for me , you won &apos;t say anything yet .
the card &apos;s good , man . run it again .
i have , man , three times .
i &apos;ve been instructed to destroy
it and to call to call your authorities
wait . just--just wait . how much for the weekend ?
including your room service bill ,
i didn &apos;t order any of this .
3 bottles of &apos; 95 dom reserve ?
are you kidding ? i &apos;m not paying for this .
hey. hey , what &apos;s going on ?
four @-@ star hotels aren &apos;t what they used to be . that &apos;s what .
hey. hey , if you need to use my card , you can .
you should aleast pay for room service .
i didn &apos;t order room service .
carter .
you don &apos;t believe me .
you didn &apos;t with that woman this morning , and you don &apos;t now .
i believe you .
i do .
you &apos;d make a terrible poker player .
i want to believe you &apos;ve changed .
you &apos;re just making it hard for me .
if youon &apos;t trust me , then what are we doing ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i came to apologize .
so apologize .
that was it . but it comes with a bottle of champagne--
your favorite vintage , if i &apos;m not mistaken .
look , our relationship should be more important
than business deals or secret societies .
so what do you propose ? ii propose we
don &apos;t go to the auction tonight .
neither one of u gets the photograph .
it &apos;s the only way .
mm , pity .
i already have my bidding paddle .
well ...
i &apos;m sure we can find some other use for it .
hey .
hey . thanks for meeting me .
sorry i sounded so cryptic on the phone .
no , no. don &apos;t worry about it .
i was having lunch with geogina
a couple blocks away . so what &apos;s up ?
scott &apos;s been lying to everyone. what ?
what--what do you
he &apos;s not a student here .
wait . he &apos;s been lying about going to nyu ?
why--why would anyone do that ? have you confronted him ?
vanessa , come on. he &apos;s been pretending to take classes ,
been recommending professors to you--that is beyond creepy .
you gotta tell me what &apos;s going on .
hey .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt ,
but blair actually locked me out , and by the size
of the sock on the doorknob , i didn &apos;t want to knock .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee
and let you guys continue to stare at each other .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m leaving .
vanessa , wait .
are--are you gonna come to the auction tonight ?
cause my dad want s us all to be there .
we can talk then .
right . rufus . yeah ,
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll definitely be there .
i &apos;m a good listener .
her boyfriend is
apparently lying about going to school here ,
and she won &apos;t tell me why .
well , she obviously likes the guy
and wants to wish for the best .
i mean , it &apos; not exactly unprecedented in affairs of the heart .
so i let it go , do nothing ?
no , silly . we find out who this guy really is .
buckman . car detailed .
dorota . dry cleaning .
we &apos;ve been waiting a week for this .
i &apos;m turning them off .
w @-@ wait .
&quot; got word photo could go for $ 5,500 &quot; ?
how could you ?
hey. g-- &quot; the last mcmullan went for $ 3,000 &quot; ?
i guess dorota &apos;s counterintelligence
isn &apos;t what it used to be .
don &apos;t change the subject .
i can &apos;t believe you lied to me .
trying to use sex to distract me .
i learned from the best .
that photograph is mine .
she stole my shoes
is there anything else that he told you ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
he said he played soccer in high school ,
claimed he was m.v.p.
soccer . is there a team name or a mascot ?
uh , yeah , uh , lions. wow. okay .
i don &apos;t know how i remember that .
well , least he was honest about sports .
typical .
his last name &apos;s not adler .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s rosson . does that mean anything to you ?
i figured you &apos;d probably be halfway back to boston by now .
oh , i thought about it .
and ?
i thought about you .
i called my parents . i had it out with them .
i told them what i needed to do ,
and they didn &apos;t take it very well . i was just hoping
that ii wouldn &apos;t have to go through telling rufus alone .
you don &apos;t .
scott rosson-- he wrote me that
after reading my short story in &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
fan letter ?
so he &apos;s kinda like your stalker ?
i guess .
how rock star is that ?
hey , vanessa . uh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s me .
look , scott is not who he says he is .
and i don &apos;t know . he--he could be dangerous .
um , please call me .
so what now ?
she said she was going to the auction .
do you have plans tonight ?
no .
turns out photographs
won &apos;t be the only thing up for grabs tonight .
a priceless secret is on the auction block
and bidding begins now .
are you ready ?
missing call from dan
look at me .
you can do this . okay ?
come on .
b. , what are you doing here ?
i need a photograph that &apos;s up for auction tonight
to get into the la table elitaire .
but chuck wants it for some business deal .
can you believe that ? putting his own happiness above mine ?
what kind boyfriend does that ?
how is that a healthy relationship ? tell me !
i take it you two still haven &apos;t--
there aren &apos;t enough curse words in the world
to satisfy me right now .
i &apos;m sorry .
if it makes you feel any better ,
you were right about carter
i should have listened to you .
it &apos;s for the best , s. most guys just are who they are .
hey .
my bottegas --where are they ?
consider them prisoners war .
they &apos;ll be relsed when i have the photograph .
and don &apos;t think you can distract
me with another ounce of dom .
so i see you &apos;re not with your , uh , sidekick this evening .
it &apos;s probably best . this place doesn &apos;t accept i.o.u.s.
some guys just are ...
who they are ? that &apos;s exactly what blair just said .
i &apos;m right here , okay ?
hey ! i dn &apos;t think you guys were coming .
remember when i told you
there was something i wanted to talk to you about today ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .

the auction will begin in a few minutes .
sorry . could you give me one second ?

i &apos;m not here to stop you .
i &apos;m here to stand by you .
when they came looking for you so soon after andrew ,
the thought of losing you , too ...
i told your father to lie . it &apos;s my fault .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m here tonight , to tell you ...
you &apos;re my son .
sweetie ...

dad . thank god .
hey , we need to find vanessa and scott .
i was just with them . why ?
scott is .
we think he could be dan &apos;s stalker .
hi . georgina sparks .
yeah , you may remember me as--as sarah ,
but , um , it &apos;s nice to see you again , sir .
do you remember my fan letter from last year ?
that was him . he &apos;seen using a different last name .
he &apos;s been lying about going to school ,
and he &apos;s been be friending all of us .
yeah. no , he could be dangerous .
dangerous ?
he &apos;s not . he just wants to talk to you .
talk to me about what ?
he &apos;ll explain everything .
sct , uh , what &apos;s going on ?
i haven &apos;t told you the truth .
my last name is ... rosson .
this is my mom .
i &apos;m your son &apos;s brother ,
andrew &apos;s brother ,
and i , uh , just really wanted to meet you .
sorry , vanessa. looks like the price of truth
was just too rich for scott &apos;s blood .
s. , what are you doing ?
what are you guys doing sabotaging carter ?
3 bottles of &apos; 95 dom on his hotel room service bill--
one of your favorites , if i recall .
so we started a stealth campaign to destroy his credibility .
the warrant .
what warrant ?
well , he might want to take a d.n.a. sample
down to the 24th precinct tomorrow
the point is i did it to protect you .
me ? just hate the guy .
all carter cares about is himself .
when we ran him out of town six months ago ,
he traded his dubai ticket for greece .
greece ?
spent the next few months checking in and out
of every restaurant and hotel from there to fiji .
he only came back because he was broke .
he went looking for him .
who ?
my father. i found out he was getting remarried ,
two years ago , in santorini .
finally. what happened in santorini .
i wanted to see him , but i didn &apos;t want anyone to know ,
so i went to carter , he said he has an access to go .
when the police picked us up on the way to the wedding ,
i realized &quot; access &quot; meant stolen .
carter promised he &apos;d make it up to me .
i had no idea he &apos;s been looking for my father himself .
and didn &apos;t find him ?
you know , i have to go .
fine. i &apos;ll call my guy at the precinct .
i don &apos;t understand why you did &apos;t just tell me who you were .
i was not sure if you want talk to me .
i wasn &apos;t even sure what i would say if you did .
hey , let &apos;s just , uh , go back to the house
you and your mom , and we &apos;ll--we &apos;ll get to know each other better .
no , i &apos;d like that , it &apos;s just ... in time .
for now , i think this is a good first step .
u got--you got a great family , mr. humphrey ,
and my brother would have been proud to know you , all of you .
thanks , scott .
you don &apos;t know how much that means to me .
brahms &apos; &quot; op . 118 no . 1 , intermezzo in &apos; a &apos; minor &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , s. but it &apos;s still carter .
are you sure it &apos;s worth the risk ?
i don &apos;t know. you tell me. you and chuck are
two of the most self @-@ centered ,
damaged people i know .
i am not following
well , somehow two wrongs make a twisted right .
you don &apos;t think it was worth the risk ?
here. you know what to do with this .
damn him .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i want you to have this .
why ?
because i love you ,
you enormously stubborn pain in the ass .
and what about le table elitairer ?
what about them ?
i believe in you .
and if this is what it takes for you to believe in you ,
then ...
it &apos;s worth it .
in a bidding war , even when you win ,
what you thought you wanted can suddenly be reappraised ...
does le table elitaire unretire even exist , georgina ?
i &apos;m sorry , but my french is a little rusty .
maybe you should start with &quot; excusez @-@ moi . &quot;
you know , i should have recognized your &quot; g &quot;
when blair first showed me the invitation .
it has caused me enough trouble in the past .
well , le table elitaire does exsist
my friend devyn was a member in dartmouth .
although i doubt the n.y.u. chapter
has ever heard of blair waldorf--
if there even is an n.y.u. chapter .
oh , good. so you haven &apos;t change at all ?
what about dan ?
dan is dan. but when it comes to blair waldorf ,
i don &apos;t have to do much but sit back , lit a match
and watch her go up in flames .
well , if you keep pushing her , she will push back .
and when she does , i will be right behind her .
now we &apos;ve had enough of you tonight .
other times ,
old opponents resurface to raise the stakes ...
i thought after the night we &apos;ve had , we &apos;d hit morondi &apos;s--
some lemon spaghetti , some fried artickes .
did someone say food ? i &apos;m starving .
tell me where just find georgina .
oh , you know what ? don &apos;t bother. um , she already left .
she said she had a headache or something .
what ? oh , okay. it &apos;s kind of weird
i should--i &apos;ll call her .
tomorrow. we &apos;ll talk first .
how about it , vanessa ? you hungry ?
but it &apos;s the things we walk away from
that feel like they cost the most .
let &apos;s go .
and yet , it &apos;s when we &apos;ve been outbid ,
forced to watch our prize go home with others ,
that the rules oprotocol no longer apply .
i wouldn &apos;t put your paddles away just yet .
who knows what bidders will do when they &apos;re desperate ?
hey. glad u called .
do you want to do something today ?
oh , you know , i can &apos;t .
oh. serena told you about blair and chuck .
yeah. yeah , she did .
look , i @-@ i sent that invitation out last week ,
before you and i got together .
but it &apos;s blair and chuck .
i mean , talk about a viimless crime .
yeah , i--yeah , i know .. that &apos;s fair point .
but i really think we should cool things off for a while ,
you know , take a-- take a little break ?
a break ? already ?
well , we did say no strings .
right .
no strings .
i &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
sorry .
i thought you should know that she hadn &apos;t changed .
no , you--you did the right thing to tell me .
and speaking of , uh , change ...
yeah , i left carter , like , a dozen messages .
he doesn &apos;t want anything to do with me .
i @-@ i highly doubt that . you &apos;re a pretty tough one to shake .
well , maybe if i didn &apos;t believe in him .
he is right to shake me .
you know , i think my dad is attempting crepes .
we might want to check the smoke alarms .
good plan .
so how &apos;d it work ?
you happen to mention our meeting to georgina ,
and she hatched up a plan to cause trouble
between me and my girlfriend ?
georgie and i go back .
the girl has an m.b.a. in deviant behavior .
and you &apos;re going to need a better sense of humor
in the club business .
nice photo .
thanks .
chuck bass . big fan .
by the way ,
when your lease at the empire hotel
isn &apos;t renewed ,
thank bright eyes here .
thanks for seeing me .
i wanted to say good @-@ bye before i left for boston .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
you can &apos;t ask me to keep this secret .
rufus and lily gave me up .
now that was their choice .
i don &apos;t blame them for that ,
but i think that this time , this choice should be mine .
promise me that ...
you &apos;ll come back one day and tell them .
i can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m really glad you came .
what do you want , serena ?
it was chuck and blair -- the girl on the street ,
your room service , your credit card .
yeah , i sorta put that together yesterday .
you did ?
when it comes to an eye for an eye ,
chuck &apos;s a man of the cloth .
plus , having spent so much time with blair ,
the &apos; 95 dom was kind of a tell .
so why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
i did . i told you it wasn &apos;t me .
i &apos;m not a saint , serena .
if you &apos;re looking for the first excuse to bolt , trust me ,
you &apos;re gonna find one .
for my sake , i figured sooner was better than later .
i &apos;m not looking for an excuse anymore .
who says the offer &apos;s still on the table ?
now who &apos;d make a terrible poker player ?
come on .
will you eat breakfast with my family ?
? there was a time when my world was filled ... ?
hey . we &apos;re gonna need an extra seat .
hi . how you doing ?
ah , fresh crepes .
? and i stopped dreaming now i &apos;m supposed to ?
? fill it up with something ?
? something , something ?
you said you wanted to talk .
why here ?
i just came from sean macpherson &apos;s office .
i wanted to thank his assistant .
she did me a favor .
i was thinking too small .
why settle for some club ...
in a hotel ...
when you can just buy the hotel ?
chuck ...
a club is one thing , but a hotel ?
i &apos;ve been meeting with the board
of bass industries all morning .
i told them i want to cash my shares out ...
risk it all ,
on my own .
they think i &apos;ve lost my mind .
have you ?
no .
then how can you be so sure ?
because you believe in me .
now ... i booked the penthouse for us .
what do you say we chris in my legacy ?
or do you need to be bribed ?
bye .
carter baizen .
bree buckley .
heard through the grapevine you were back in new york
and dating serena van der woodsen , no less .
what do you want ?
are you kidding ?
i &apos;m headed home to face the family firing squad .
considering what you did to us , being able to find you
is gonna go a long way in getting me back in .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be in touch .
oh , and , um , go ahead and run , if you want .
you know how much daddy loves to hunt .
? i change shapes just to hide in this place ?
? but i &apos;m still , i &apos;m still an animal ?
yes . when &apos;s the next train to boston ?
thanks .
? i change shapes just to hide in this place ?

on what happens next ?
going once , going twice .
