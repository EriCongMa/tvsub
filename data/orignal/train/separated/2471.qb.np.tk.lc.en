i &apos;m moving to dallas .
i &apos;m leaving today .
i &apos;ve hired a nurse to come with me .
what ?
do you have a better idea ?
me .
i will fix this .
stefan , i promise you .
i have a way to take down rayna .
a pile of bricks called the armory .
the armory is a black hole of lies .
no !
you &apos;re not supposed to die for me , bon .
neither is my brother .
which is why i have to take myself out of the equation .
you &apos;ll never have to worry about me again .
welcome to new orleans .
freya , stefan needs a favor .
a mystical vampire huntress stabbed you with her magic sword .
stefan .
klaus killed her .
but surprise , surprise ...
she regenerates .
... and won &apos;t rest until you &apos;re dead .
no matter how far i run , this wound acts as a beacon ,
drawing her to me .
well , i can &apos;t cure the wound ,
but this salve will mask it &apos;s signal .
what do you want ?
just looking for a bite .
oh , god . you &apos;re a vampire .
and you &apos;re lunch .
shouldn &apos;t he be turning all gray ?
all the other ones turned gray .
unless of course you missed .
how many vampires have i killed in the last few days ?
a lot , but who knows how many you would have killed
if you hadn &apos;t missed a third of the time .
he &apos;s got a thick jacket on .
i can &apos;t see exactly where his heart is .
outerwear ?
that &apos;s your excuse ?
you gonna stand there and brag all day ,
or you gonna help me load him into the truck ?
we got to get him out of here before the ...
julian &apos;s other vampires get suspicious ?
too late .
touch it and die .
actually , why don &apos;t you die anyway ?
you saved our lives .
yes , i did .
which means you owe me one .
you ever heard of a vampire named stefan salvatore ?
you mind just paying attention to the road a little bit more ?
well , i could , but then i might miss
the world &apos;s largest ball of yarn coming up on the left .
and there it goes .
not quite sure what i was expecting .
well , that was the last of freya &apos;s herbs ,
which means it &apos;s only a matter of time before they wear off
and rayna can track me .
good thing we &apos;re on our way to get more .
are we ? because it sure feels like we &apos;re on our way
to the world &apos;s largest waste of time .
we have to take back roads to avoid being spotted .
you &apos;ve only been running a few days , stefan .
think of it like it &apos;s an adventure .
i don &apos;t want an adventure .
just want to get these herbs
and have a nice quiet home @-@ cooked meal
with my girlfriend .
then do what ?
pay bills ?
talk about your day ?
well , you don &apos;t actually enjoy this , do you ?
there &apos;s a certain constant in the lack of constants .
and once you accept it , it &apos;s invigorating .
we &apos;re here .
what is this place ?
well , according to freya ,
all the herbs witches use are stored here .
just in case something happens to them .
all of them ?
yeah .
well , i hope you know what this particular herb looks like .
and why is that ?
because witches are very fond of their herbs .
oh , good , you &apos;re up .
how &apos;s bonica magica ?
not great , but ...
good enough to make sure you never call me that again .
someone &apos;s cheery .
well , i &apos;m a man with a plan .
which is ?
a secret .
does it have to do with killing rayna the huntress ?
i &apos;ll never tell .
but ... yes .
good . how can i help ?
you can &apos;t .
this is the damon only show .
it &apos;s damon versus cray @-@ na .
because that won &apos;t get you right back in hell .
you don &apos;t even know how to kill her .
but you know who might ?
don &apos;t even think about it .
enzo &apos;s been calling me nonstop .
probably to apologize for yesterday .
i bet if i go back to the armory ,
i can find out more info .
what the hell ?
look around , bonnie .
i &apos;m not here for the filmy hospital pudding .
you almost died in that place .
and i &apos;ll never let that happen again .
promise me you will stay out of this , bon .
no one needs to get hurt for me anymore .
i can handle rayna .
here &apos;s where we stand .
i &apos;ve killed five of your friends because they couldn &apos;t tell me
where stefan salvatore was .
i sure hope you can .
you two , watch and learn .
the key is to treat them like you would a wild animal .
respecting the danger
but recognizing that they &apos;re beneath you
and that they serve a purpose .
for example , this one will provide information .
tell me everything you know about stefan salvatore ,
or i &apos;ll send you to hell for eternity .
barking up the wrong vampire there , sister .
stefan &apos;s antisocial , not many friends .
actually , no friends at all .
but i hear he has a very handsome and charming brother .
you might want to talk to him .
yeah , a stupid brother .
seems foolish of you to come back here .
i know , right ?
to be honest ... i &apos;m not that brave .
i did have a shockingly effective ally
tell me that you were here .
what the hell did you do ?
it &apos;s okay , damon &apos;s a ...
aw , you almost said &quot; friend . &quot; how sweet .
his brother is a friend .
and that &apos;s the only reason i &apos;m helping him .
and the world yawned .
get rid of this thing .
anything else ?
yeah .
you know where i can get a buzz saw ?
here we go .
they &apos;re my girlfriend &apos;s .
and given the fact that you two look exactly alike ,
you should be able to fit in them .
what &apos;s next ? it puts the lotion in the basket ?
it wouldn &apos;t have to if it just stayed dead .
bit of a pickle here , ray .
i got big plans .
you buy a time @-@ share ?
kind of , actually .
but i can &apos;t go on vacation until i do something about you .
see , i can &apos;t relax and sip mai tais
while you &apos;re out hunting my brother .
and every time i kill you , you just phoenix back to life .
it &apos;s a dill .
well , why don &apos;t you just let me kill your brother ,
then you can do whatever the hell you want .
tempting , truly .
but i kind of owe him .
family , am i right ?
that &apos;s why you and i have to put our heads together
and come up with a plan b.
you want me to go against my very nature
because he &apos;s your family ?
pretty much .
funny thing is ...
family &apos;s the very reason this is my nature .
my father envisioned a world without vampires .
i will not rest until i see his vision through .
so what do you propose we do ?
rub each one on your wound and hope for the best ?
i don &apos;t know , you &apos;re a witch ,
why have you never heard of this ?
it is strange .
botanically , i am very well @-@ versed .
there &apos;s wolfsbane .
vervain .
senna .
witch hazel .
and this fun little guy ...
mm , that one i know .
the witchy hallucinogen ?
the one borderline recreational herb .
stefan , i misjudged you .
you actually do have fun .
i did it once .
what was her name ?
really ? there has to be a her ?
with someone like you ,
there &apos;s always a bad influence .
well , her name was rebekah .
let &apos;s just say she was a lot to handle .
course she was .
and that &apos;s why she &apos;s not in the picture .
see , you prefer small town girls
who want to settle down .
who are easy to handle .
i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s ever called caroline forbes
&quot; easy to handle . &quot;
and as thrilling as this therapy session is ...
i think i found it .
or where it used to be .
lovely-- a dead end .
what is that ?
night , night .
you actually came .
i &apos;m shocked .
so did it grow back , or ...
no , actually , i had to reattach it .
but thank you for your concern .
less concern , more curiosity .
well , at least you &apos;re thinking of me .
i take you received my messages .
i did ,
and i &apos;m not stupid enough to think that your apologies
were anything other than a tactic to get me here .
but here i am . fair warning :
if you try to disable my magic again ,
you &apos;ll wish i only cut off your hand .
i see damon &apos;s obscenity is rubbing off on you .
it &apos;s quite pathetic , really .
you know , you following him around like some high school groupie .
mm , i forgot-- you two used to be friends .
and now you have none .
oh , you think you &apos;re friends ?
lorenzo .
you must be bonnie bennett .
i &apos;m alex st. john . welcome to the armory .
i &apos;m sorry for enzo &apos;s behavior yesterday .
he wasn &apos;t following proper protocol .
i asked him to call you back here .
might &apos;ve gotten off on the wrong foot .
the wrong foot ? or ...
not funny .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s kind of funny .
rayna cruz is a common enemy .
we should be working together to fight her .
but you don &apos;t want to fight her .
you want her captured .
so i think you know a lot more than you &apos;re letting on .
makes it hard for me to trust you .
fair .
why don &apos;t you come with me ?
this room contains everything the armory has gathered
on rayna cruz .
list of victims , her lineage ,
the spell used to create her .
and , most importantly ,
the shamans that gave their lives for her .
the eight everlastings .
you mean two everlastings .
the other six look pretty &quot; lasted . &quot;
there should be three preserved corpses .
we lost another one ?
did you know about this ?
why wasn &apos;t i told ?
it must have just happened .
damn it .
i take it from her subtle shift in attitude
that &apos;s a bad thing .
every time rayna dies ,
one of the bodies decays .
we &apos;ve lost quite a few this past week ,
and if we lose all of them , rayna dies for good .
so ...
hunting vampires is your identity .
your fundamental &quot; this is who i am ... &quot;
in a nutshell .
you ever wonder if there &apos;s a way to change that ?
no , i don &apos;t .
because there &apos;s not .
i used to think that .
look , i &apos;m selfish .
narcissistic , prone to unnecessary bouts of violence ...
tell me again why i shouldn &apos;t be killing you .
because i changed .
i mean , temporarily , as it were ,
but it happened . just took the right person .
maybe you haven &apos;t found the right person .
i don &apos;t need a vampire matchmaker .
but thanks .
well , i mean , have you ever even tried ?
has there ever been a ...
mr. hunter ?
there has been .
i see .
never mind .
looks like i don &apos;t have to pretend i care .
you have five seconds to tell me exactly what &apos;s happening
or you &apos;re not leaving here alive .
i &apos;m sorry .
did i hurt your feelings by lying
about my true intentions for being here ?
feels crappy , doesn &apos;t it ?
what did you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
damon , on the other hand ...
is an idiot .
why ?
because he &apos;s finally taking care of the problem you couldn &apos;t ?
no , because every time rayna dies ,
she comes back stronger !
except for that last one , right ?
she won &apos;t be stronger when she &apos;s dead for good .
why do we even want her alive ?
you know , i wouldn &apos;t worry about that .
i &apos;d worry about this .
this is the spell those shamans used to create her .
and ...
just ... read it .
great spirit ,
we call upon you in this moment of need .
they live on within you .
the sword .
it has linking magic .
it creates a bond between rayna and her victims .
we knew that .
well , that &apos;s not all .
shamans didn &apos;t want her going to her eternal rest
with any unfinished business , so they added an extra addendum .
the scars are a fail @-@ safe .
if rayna dies ...
so does anyone she &apos;s marked .
stefan has one of those scars , doesn &apos;t he ?
i &apos;m not happy about you going against my wishes .
but i do suppose that me lecturing anyone on respecting authority ...
where &apos;s rayna ?
in a moderately shallow grave .
you know , i got tired of digging ,
but it should do the trick .
you have to dig her up .
no way !
she &apos;ll flame to life underground ,
suffocate ... poof .
final life over .
hunter &apos;s problem solved .
rayna can &apos;t die again .
pardon me ?
the wounds from her sword ...
it &apos;s linked her to her victims .
if rayna dies
one last time ...
so does stefan .
there you are .
what did she do to me ?
apologies .
i haven &apos;t had visitors in years ,
and then , all of sudden , two in a matter of days .
i spoke with her while you slept .
somebody beat us to the punch .
came in and took all the herbs .
well , we need more .
unfortunately , there is no more .
that herb is rare for a reason .
it has strong anti @-@ magic ,
and therefore anti @-@ witch , properties .
let &apos;s just say
that this isn &apos;t from a bad laser peel .
there has to be more somewhere .
there &apos;s not .
witches eradicated it from the world a century ago .
this was the only source .
i did have a shockingly effective ally
tell me that you were here .
so there are good vampires
and bad vampires .
yes .
kind of . it &apos;s complicated .
and this is a bad vampire ,
one that killed your sister ?
yes .
but that was a long time ago
and , like i said , i &apos;m not helping him .
again , it &apos;s complicated .
because you &apos;re helping his brother ...
who &apos;s a good vampire .
exactly .
so this good vampire ...
does he feed on people , too ?
does he kill them ?
stefan ...
i mean , not right now , but ...
it &apos;s complicated ?
the thing is , i &apos;ve just spent the past few days with you
learning about how much you hate vampires
and what they did to your town .
i do .
and yet , you just helped one of them
take down a vampire @-@ killing machine .
that doesn &apos;t sound complicated .
penny , you have no idea what i &apos;ve been through in this town .
you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t .
but i do wonder how much of it you went through
because you never took a real stand .
at a certain point ,
it stops being the vampires &apos; fault
that the town is like this ...
and it starts to be yours .
here we go .
come on .
where the hell are you ?
come on .
please be alive .
bottles are a go !
diapers also a go .
like , go away with them .
sorry .
is this a bad time ?
i guess that &apos;s relative .
i mean , i &apos;m not on the run from a supernatural huntress .
how are you ?
oh , i &apos;ve been better .
looks like it might actually be a while before i can visit .
turns out those herbs are a little more rare than we thought .
yeah .
hey , that &apos;s totally okay .
honestly , there &apos;s a chance
there was a little bit of contamination going on ,
so maybe it &apos;s not the worst thing .
hey , listen , i was thinking , um ...
i &apos;ve been on the run with valerie for the last few days
and without those herbs , i &apos;m not going to be able to slow down .
but maybe you could tag in ?
i know being on the run seems awful ,
but it could be fun .
we could go to europe .
see the world .
just you and me .
what do you think ?
stefan ...
i @-@ i just ... i just want to see you , care .
i want to see you , too . but ...
it &apos;s kind of a war zone over here right now , and ...
alaric really ...
he needs you .
yeah .
yeah , i get it .
well , we &apos;ll @-@ we &apos;ll figure it out once this huntress thing is over .
yes . we will .
so , out of curiosity ,
what are your feelings about dallas ?
dallas .
i hadn &apos;t really thought about it .
well , it &apos;s not a terrible place to live .
and , you know , the babies are here .
backup ! i need backup right now .
and more diapers .
i &apos;m sorry , stefan . i gotta run .
i get it .
i love you .
i love you , too .
she &apos;s staying , isn &apos;t she ?
looks like it .
we &apos;ll figure something out .
stefan ...
what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s wrong with me ?
what &apos;s happening ?
please be alive .
stefan .
my ... chest ...
stefan ?
stefan !
come on .
drink .
no .
damn it .
stefan .
breathe ! come on , breathe .
breathe ...
i can &apos;t siphon it . it &apos;s not working .
breathe .
i said ...
breathe !
thank god .
uh @-@ oh .
&quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; is right .
what the hell are you doing ?
you said she gets stronger each time she comes back to life .
damon can &apos;t kill her . he &apos;s walking into a fight
he can &apos;t win .
the armory is on their way to mystic falls .
they &apos;ll be there soon .
not soon enough .
she &apos;s connected to an everlasting .
maybe i can weaken it . and her .
and maybe that will kill her and stefan too .
if i do nothing , she &apos;ll kill damon .
you &apos;re willing to kill for him ?
do you really think he cares that much about you ?
yeah . i do .
you have no idea what he &apos;s planning , do you ?
you want to talk about mr. huntress now , huh ?
turns out i &apos;m very interested in this particular moment .
he was a vampire .
well , what do you know ,
vampire @-@ human affairs are my specialty .
they were mine , too ; they don &apos;t work out in the long run .
considering i staked him .
go ahead . run .
i don &apos;t mind chasing a second salvatore .
if i could maybe get , like , a ...
&quot; i just saved your life &quot; head start , huh ?
you better take it .
on second thought ...
don &apos;t say i never offered you anything .
well ...
if i could kill you , this would be a much fairer fight .
your brother &apos;s dead , no matter what .
all you &apos;ve done by saving my life
is gotten yourself killed .
don &apos;t worry .
i don &apos;t miss .
fire !
apparently , neither do they .
thanks .
rayna is officially in captivity .
where &apos;s the bennett witch ?
learning how little her friend cares about her .
i don &apos;t recall telling you to let her go .
well , i thought we needed her help with rayna .
yes , rayna was the first priority .
bonnie bennett is a close second .
looking for a bottle to celebrate ?
i gotta say , i &apos;m impressed .
got your text .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be able to kill her .
actually , my exact message read :
&quot; she &apos;s taken care of . &quot;
yeah , she &apos;s taken care of .
yeah .
what , so you didn &apos;t kill her ?
i did .
a number of times .
turns out , she only has eight lives .
the last one &apos;s the problem .
turns out that if she dies for good ,
everyone with that scar on your chest does as well .
so we can &apos;t kill her .
no .
but the good news is
the armory has her ,
and they &apos;re not gonna let her escape .
except for that time they did .
look , i know it &apos;s not ideal , okay ?
it &apos;s what we got .
caroline &apos;s staying in dallas
with ric and the kids .
sorry to hear that , brother .
but i saw that coming .
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
what ?
as long as i have this scar , rayna will hunt me .
this isn &apos;t about just you and me anymore .
there &apos;s kids involved .
i &apos;m not gonna put them in danger ,
which means that i can &apos;t be with my girlfriend
as long as rayna is alive .
and you just told me she can never die .
so we have to figure out another way to get rid of her ,
or we need to get rid of this scar .
that &apos;s a good plan .
for you .
what is this ?
we both know these last few months
have been impossible for me .
i &apos;ve been walking a tightrope .
falling off constantly .
i &apos;m not a good brother when i &apos;m not with elena ,
and when i &apos;m not a good brother , people get hurt .
so you &apos;re just gonna run away ?
nope .
i &apos;m gonna stay in one place .
desiccated right next to her .
yeah .
i saved your life . time and time again .
i chose you .
i sacrificed everyone and everything for you .
you &apos;re just gonna turn your back on me now ?
we &apos;re vampires .
it &apos;s temporary , stefan .
i &apos;ll see you again .
listen to me .
if there &apos;s even a fraction of you that cares about me ,
your brother ,
your family ,
then you will not walk out that door .
save a good bottle of that bourbon for me , brother .
we &apos;re gonna need it to sort all this out
in about 60 years .
really not the best time , matt .
this won &apos;t take long .
i don &apos;t want to have to kick you out of here , but i will .
yeah , i know you will .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do to stop you .
because you &apos;re a vampire ,
and i &apos;m a human .
i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about that lately .
about my place in this town .
my home .
whenever vampires are here ,
humans will always be at their mercy .
whatever laws we pass , you can break .
whatever lives we build , you can destroy .
we don &apos;t stand a chance against you .
that stops today .
excuse me ?
vampires need to leave mystic falls ...
for good .
all of you .
look , i appreciate whatever moral crisis
you &apos;re going through right now ,
but this is my home .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
this is footage from the grill today .
of damon doing some very not human things to rayna .
i &apos;ve got footage of you , too .
hundreds of hours from the town surveillance system .
now ...
i don &apos;t want to show it to anyone
or expose you .
you threatening me ?
yeah .
i am .
and i hate that .
i hate that i have to threaten my friend
because he &apos;s a vampire .
i hate that i &apos;m friends with vampires at all .
but , this isn &apos;t about me .
or you .
this is about our home ,
which has been destroyed
time and time again .
this is the only way to break that cycle .
you have until the end of the day .
damon , too .
hey , buddy .
so i know this is a crappy way to do this , but ...
hey , i &apos;m a crappy person ,
so i guess it fits .
by the time you read this ,
i &apos;ll be desiccated in a coffin next to elena .
and i won &apos;t wake up until she does ,
so i guess this might be my official good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m not gonna get lame or mushy , but ...
you deserve the truth .
i &apos;m telling stefan that the world is a better place
without an elena @-@ less damon .
that it was best for everyone that i was gone .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll see through that .
because , to be completely honest ,
i don &apos;t give a damn about the world .
the truth is , i &apos;m not in a good spot .
hell , i &apos;m miserable .
and i have been ever since she left me .
before her , i didn &apos;t know what it was like to be happy .
to be fulfilled .
to be complete .
but now i do .
and now that i know that feeling ,
to live without it ?
there &apos;s no point .
so that &apos;s it .
nice knowing you .
you weren &apos;t even gonna say good @-@ bye .
enzo told me that you asked him for elena &apos;s coffin .
he told me what you were planning .
i didn &apos;t believe him .
i thought ...
if damon desiccates until elena wakes up ,
i &apos;ll never see him again .
he &apos;d never do that .
i wrote you a letter
and i gave to stefan ...
are we friends ?
of course , bonnie .
we don &apos;t actively try and kill each other anymore .
no , i &apos;m not doing that .
no insults .
no jokes .
are we friends ?
i know why you wanted to do this in a letter .
so you could desiccate in peace ,
imagining whatever reaction you wanted .
me reading it and thinking ,
&quot; huh . i &apos;m really gonna miss him . &quot;
well , too bad ,
because that &apos;s not my reaction .
this is .
i am not okay with this decision .
i &apos;m not okay with you choosing yourself .
and i &apos;m not okay with never seeing you ...
... my best friend ,
ever again .
this hurts me .
this hurts ...
this hurts me ...
and as you desiccate ,
and as you feel the pangs of hunger
as the blood drains from your body ,
that &apos;s what i want you to remember .
that you hurt me .
bon ... listen to me ...
no . no .
you don &apos;t get to say good @-@ bye .
damon . wake up .
i need you .
wake the hell up !
we gotta go .
why ?
she &apos;s back .
my scar , opened up this morning .
she &apos;s not gonna stop until you &apos;re dead .
tyler , it &apos;s stefan . my scar opened up ;
i don &apos;t have much time .
i need you to warn caroline .
okay , i &apos;m on it .
but you should be running .
i &apos;m way ahead of you .
i never want to hear the name
&quot; stefan salvatore &quot;
ever again .
... how one stupid decision
can turn your life into something
that you don &apos;t recognize .
thank you , bonnie .
damon .
when &apos;s the last time you talked to your fiancée ?
what the hell do you want ?
stefan &apos;s being hunted again ,
and it &apos;s only a matter of time
before caroline &apos;s the bait that &apos;s used to lure him out .
my name is caroline .
i have an urgent message for stefan salvatore .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
23 minutes . that &apos;s just enough time for me to get in ,
take out little miss stabby pants , and grab caroline .
oh , turn , turn , turn .
we apologize for the inconvenience ...
oh , that &apos;s not good .
you &apos;ve been poisoned with werewolf toxin .
get up .
you &apos;re helping her ?
all right , i did it . he &apos;s out .
now i never see you again , right ?
have a nice life .
i don &apos;t know about you , but ...
i &apos;m exhausted .
i feel like there should be champagne or something .
yeah . you finally got me .
here i am .
i &apos;m totally not taking credit , by the way .
i mean ... you came to me .
you were safe .
in the wind .
you played it smart .
then you got dumb on me .
what happened ?
i mean , okay ,
we know what happened .
i took someone that you love .
damon ...
and caroline .
guess that makes two people .
just out of curiosity ,
which one of them brought you here ?
her or him ?
fine .
keep your secrets .
you &apos;ll need something to keep you company in hell .
or ... there is a plan b.
but i know how you feel about making choices .
plan b ?
yes .
because , believe it or not ,
i don &apos;t actually want to kill you , stefan .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
just take my word for it .
i know you don &apos;t deserve that mark ,
but somebody else does .
what if i were to tell you there &apos;s a way
