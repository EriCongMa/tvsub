We're still having trouble contacting the mom for an interview.
Any help there?
Jackie? Sure.
She's probably circling the building.
No, Alicia's mom.
Oh.That might prove a little more difficult.
Let me check.
Good.
Now, Will Gardner, Alicia's boss,
I still want to interview him.
Okay.
How about Diane Lockhart?
We'd prefer Mr. Gardner.
Why?
They went to Georgetown together.
I'll see what I can do.
Is there anything else, Mandy?
An interview with Alicia wouldn't hurt.
It seems this cover story is
more about Alicia than Peter.
No, we've just had greater access to Peter.
Am I being sandbagged?
Define sandbagged.
Is this a hit piece?
No.
It is an objective profile of your candidate...
Come on, Mandy, you still want something from me.
What's going on?
Get me face time with Alicia Florrick.
Tell me what's up first.
I have solid information of an affair.
Solid information?
What? From the checkout line?
Eli, you asked, so I told.
Get me some face time with Alicia.
When do you go to press?
This week.
Come on, Alicia, come on.
This is Alicia Florrick. Please...
So, if went looking for your voice recognition software...
Our name would be at the top.
And this is a search engine result
from last year-- June 2011.
That's your software?
Margarita Motions?
Yes.
Julie and mine. We named it after our moms.
Margaret and Rita.
Gizmodo considered it
the top voice recognition software in the country,
and you resisted being bought out by Apple and Microsoft.
Yes, we wanted to do it on our own, like our hero,
Neil Gross.
And what happened after June 2011?
We dropped.
Overnight, we dropped.
Now you have to flip through
28 pages of search results to find us.
And if I were to look for your software by using your name...?
Try it. Type it in.
"Do you want Margarita Mixes?"
It always corrects that way.
And you say this happened overnight?
Yes, it did. June 13, 2011.
And why do you know that date so specifically?
Well, a week earlier,
we were approached by a sales rep from Chumhum,
Mr. Gross's company.
They wanted us to buy ads for the search engine,
and we said no; we wanted to save the money for hiring.
And then a week later, you dropped to page 28 in their results?
Yes.
And that's why you're suing for unfair trade practices?
Yes. The problem is,
if the search engine doesn't acknowledge you,
you don't exist.
We went bankrupt.
We lost our money, our parents' money,
our friends' money.
We read your book...
Mr. Gross, we went to the same college.
We're just trying to do what you did.
Objection, Your Honor.
Please ask the witness to refrain from addressing my client.
Would you like me to ask her to not look at him, too?
Okay, do I have to separate you two?
Can you please speak up?
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Ms. Sun...
let me read you a review by the tech blogger UberTech,
posted two days before your search engine drop.
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized. It stinks."
Don't you think your search engine drop
was due to the negative reviews?
A drop isn't based on the quality of a product.
It's based on how many people link to it.
Yes. But didn't, a week earlier, competing software,
Wicked Savage Designs, go on sale?
And isn't it more popular?
It is now.
Isn't it at the top of all voice-recognition searches?
Yes, but Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
What?
I said, Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
Well, here we are again.
Good to see you, Mr. Gross.
This is harassment, pure and simple.
I don't think you've met our newest associate, Cary Agos.
Well, some people create, others destroy.
Yup, I'll write that down.
Wait here, please. We'll be right back.
They got the whole team.
I'll go get Julie and Elizabeth?
Good. I want him to negotiate
while our clients are staring right at him.
Uh, hello?
Is that him?!
Is that the bastard?
How many drinks does it take?!
How many?!
You rented out our conference room?
In my capacity as trustee,
supervising the restructuring of Lockhart-Gardner,
and taking upon myself the task
of seeking other cash-flow opportunities...
Mr. Hayden, we need our conference room.
It's for three days.
They're paying $8,765.
We're in the middle of a million-dollar negotiation.
Where do you want me to do it-- in the bathroom?
Out of respect for his fellow alums,
and without admitting fault...
You bitch!
You stupid bitch!
Um... Mr. Gross is offering $123,000
to help defray Julie and Elizabeth's initial start-up costs.
It's odd, you're not smiling.
Usually when people joke, they smile.
You turn this down, ladies,
and you'll see what deep pockets can do.
Why don't you refrain from speaking to our clients, Mr. Gross?
Why don't you tell them the truth--
that you have no leverage here.
Leverage belongs to whomever can outlast.
And money outlasts.
We take this money, we can start over.
It doesn't even begin to address what we lost.
He won't pay more. You heard him.
We have no leverage here.
Julie, give us a day.
If we don't have leverage by then, take the offer.
You're the trustee, right?
Yes. And you are...?
Oh, I'm Viola Walsh.
I'm the defendant in your current suit.
Unfair trade practices.
May I help you?
You may.
We're gonna fight this to the last breath.
Your team is working on contingency.
And you don't fight Waterloo on contingency.
Now, I know that Will Gardner likes to battle with his ego,
but I hope more dispassionate minds can rule.
Ms. Walsh, you have to negotiate with Mr. Gardner,
not me.
You're watching out for the creditors, sir. Will isn't.
And I don't think the creditors are going to be happy
when you throw good work after bad.
I'm offering cash.
How much?
And that's how a search works.
Our software is like a gopher, but a really fast gopher.
It races through an index of billions of billions of Web pages
all connected in a web of links.
We call this gopher Chummie.
After Chummie finds all the pages connected to your search...
May I interrupt here?
Yes, Your Honor, of course.
Is it... is it loud enough?
Is this necessary?
Isn't it just trying to explain
a template-based link analysis algorithm?
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
Okay. Then we can turn it off.
There's no jury. Just me.
Of course, Your Honor. My apologies.
So there's no link between ad sales and search engine results?
That is correct.
Even if I wanted to impact the results, I couldn't.
The algorithm acts on its own.
We don't touch it.
Thank you, Mr. Gross.
Why are you shaking your head, Mr. Gross?
I don't know. The usual reasons.
Disbelief, incredulity, disappointment.
I must be endangering the future.
No, just being a bit melodramatic.
So you never tweak the algorithm?
Chummie, the squirrel, just acts on his own?
No, I didn't say that.
But you said you couldn't impact the results.
Yes. But the algorithm needs almost daily attention and revision.
I see. And why would you revise it?
Well, for one thing, to avoid spam.
Spammers are constantly trying to game the search results.
We adapt the algorithm to avoid that.
Ah, so the quality of the Web page
is taken into account in the algorithm?
Well, uh, uh, those are your words, but yes.
And that quality is determined on an almost-daily basis?
You said, "Tweak the algorithm daily."
Yes.
Did you tweak the algorithm on June 13, 2011?
I have no idea.
But you said "Almost daily," So probably?
I have no idea.
You have no idea whether the algorithm
was tweaked on June 13, 2011,
the day our clients' software dropped
from page one on your search engine results to page 28?
That is correct.
Then, Your Honor, we subpoena Chumhum for records on their algorithm.
Your Honor, excuse me. No.
The algorithm is the key to Chumhum's success.
It's their secret sauce.
If you expose the algorithm, you expose a trade secret.
So? The defendant has admitted to
changing the algorithm based on quality,
which is the exact subject of this suit.
Your Honor, I just...
And the only way to determine whether the defendant's claims are true
is to subpoena the evidence.
The best evidence rule applies here, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the plaintiff knows that
we will never reveal the algorithm.
He is just using the court authority
so that he can force us into a settlement.
The difficulty I see, Ms. Walsh,
is that an attribute-based linked analysis
is not a closed system.
Therefore, it is subject to manipulation.
So I am prone to order such a subpoena.
We ask for 24 hours to prepare our arguments.
Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
We ask for 24 hours to prepare.
Remember when I used to sleep on your couch?
Eli. What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm missing a speech to the National Council of La Raza.
How about you?
Working.
Do you mind closing the door?
What do you need, Eli?
We've never talked about this.
In fact, I've deliberately avoided talking about it.
By "it," you mean...?
You and Will.
Just so you know, I'd rather be doing anything else.
Okay.
Mandy Post, the reporter,
wants to talk to you about your... affair.
Her word.
I pushed Mandy.
She seems to have a copy of a hotel receipt
for a September 30, 2011...
encounter...
and I need to know if that timing makes sense.
I don't know.
There is a chance this all could be a bluff.
But do you have any way of checking if you were...
if there was a hotel stay?
Is she going to press with this?
She hopes to.
And I hope to stop her.
Can you?
I don't know.
She likes to think of herself as a responsible journalist.
The good news is, responsible journalists are the easiest to co-opt.
Are you still seeing him?
Let me put it this way:
if you are still seeing...
Will...
you need to stop,
for a time.
This magazine has been known to follow people.
I'm not seeing him.
Good.
Can I ask you when this stopped?
No.
Yeah?
It's me.
Where are you? Don't you come to work anymore?
What do you need, Eli?
Your help. And first of all,
let me say it's not what you think--
it's only tangentially about the campaign.
I'm not helping Peter.
It's not about--
Who's Peter?
Someone.
You have a lot of someones in your life.
Yeah.
I want one of your omelets.
Hey, Bill wants to come over
to say hi.
You know, he doesn't blame you anymore.
He's getting the cast off, and...
I was just thinking that...
Right.
So that's how we're gonna play it, is it?
How's that?
Yeah, that's better.
You know, you have a strange idea...
of how things work now.
I'm the husband
and you're the wife.
Yeah.
And this isn't your home anymore.
Clean it up.
Thomas Giles.
I work as a search engine optimizer.
And what is that?
Ms. Walsh, I know what a search engine optimizer is.
Thank you, Your Honor. Of course.
When you offer your services, Mr. Giles,
what is it that you guarantee?
To get my clients onto
the first page of a Chumhum search engine result.
I see. And did the plaintiffs hire you to do...
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
This is a preliminary hearing to discuss
the subpoena of Chumhum's algorithm.
Yes, but the question of damages must be established
before the question of a subpoena.
How many witnesses do you intend?
To establish the absence of damages? Two.
I will allow.
And did the plaintiffs hire you
to get their product on the first page of a Chumhum search?
Yes.
In other words, the plaintiffs hired you
to "game" the system.
Objection!
And the Chumhum algorithm just countered that gaming...
Objection.
Overruled.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Miss Holmes, where do you work?
In Chumhum's advertising department.
You're the evil advertiser who approached the plaintiffs
about an online ad?
Well, I hope not evil, but yes.
And they turned you down.
Yes.
Unfortunately, it happens.
So you immediately told Mr. Gross,
so that he could meddle with the algorithm and get back at them?
No.
You didn't? Really?
Because that just seems like the sensible next step.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
What did you do next, Miss Holmes?
Well, after they said no, I went on vacation.
You did? For how long?
Two weeks.
And did you tell anyone at Chumhum about the plaintiff's ad rejection?
Before vacation? No.
It was bad news.
I usually hold off on bad news.
So, just so I'm clear,
you never told anyone...
I get it, Ms. Walsh.
Any change in the algorithm
couldn't have come from the advertising department
because Miss Holmes was on vacation.
Do you have any documentation to that effect?
Of course, Your Honor.
You're on it?
Yeah. How long have I got?
We're back in court tomorrow.
There's got to be someone
this advertising rep told before her vacation.
We got this?
Were we together on September 30 last year?
Together?
I don't know. Why?
At a hotel?
Maybe. I don't know.
But you paid. I don't remember,
was it that hotel downtown, the Fairmont?
I can look.
Thanks.
Mandy Post says she has a copy of the receipt.
I don't see how she could.
Well, Eli needs something to...
refute her.
She's gonna print it?
Eli's having a meeting with her tonight to convince her not to.
I'll look right away.
You okay?
I don't know.
I feel cursed.
Will...
I like you,
and that's why I'm giving you a chance to save face.
We're upping our offer 20%.
You want a divorce?!
You got it!
We want this over.
We're offering $160,000.
Will, I know that your ego is invested in this,
but I hope that more dispassionate minds rule.
Oh, no, what do you have for us now?
You were right-- it wasn't about the advertising;
that's not why you messed with the algorithm.
Then why are we still talking?
You messed with the algorithm because Mr. Gross secretly
bought out Wicked Savage Designs.
He bought the top competing voice-recognition software,
and a week later, Margarita dropped on his search engine,
and Wicked Savage climbed.
We're presenting it in court tomorrow
unless you come up with a real offer.
Well, that was satisfying.
Sometimes the stars align.
What are you doing?
Talking to Viola.
Ms. Walsh? Yes.
We're in negotiations with her!
Calm down, Ms. Lockhart.
No.
You don't sabotage Will.
How am I sabotaging?
By talking to her.
Is she saying Will is a problematic negotiator
and you need to step in?
Is she lowballing you?
Yes, of course she is!
I'll go to the judge--
I will get you replaced for sabotaging our negotiations, I swear!
I am helping you!
Of course she's lowballing me.
I'm not dumb. I'm getting her offer up.
Why do you think she added 20%?
She thinks she's pulling me on to her side.
But she's not?
Ms. Lockhart...
I work for the firm.
Yes, I have the power to veto you and Mr. Gardner,
but your success...
is my success.
You have been paranoid for so long,
you don't recognize when someone is on your side.
No. Actually, I'm waiting for a call.
I'm just gonna call about homework.
Eli is calling this number, and I don't want to miss it.
I'll get the call waiting.
Grace, I said no. In ten minutes.
Hello?
Alicia?
Yeah. Eli?
Can you talk?
Yeah.
I'm here with Mandy, talking over the story.
Yeah.
You're in the clear.
How? She got the date wrong?
No.
It's, uh...
i-it's not about you.
Don't worry.
Eli, thank you. I...
Thank you.
Okay, I gotta go.
Take care.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Can I have the phone now?
"May I have the phone now?"
May I?
I love you.
I love you, too.
You all right?
Yeah.
Oh, actually, I do need the phone, just for one minute.
Now?
Yeah, I left my cell phone at work.
Alicia, hi.
How are you?
Okay.
We're okay.
You talked to Eli?
Just now.
It wasn't about us.
Good. Who's it about?
Um... I've gotta go.
Yeah. Thanks for calling, Alicia.
You're welcome.
You've reached the voice mail of Eli Gold.
Zach, Grace, I'm going to go out for a few minutes.
Alicia, hey.
Everything all right?
I don't know, Eli, is it?
Mandy.
You said it wasn't about us, so who's it about?
Alicia.
Eli, it's going to come out anyway.
It's, it's a lie, it's gossip,
the same as when we thought it was you and Will.
I'm gonna make this easy.
There's a rumor of Peter sleeping with someone last year.
Mandy has a hotel receipt?
We were separated, Eli.
Just tell me.
I'm just getting to the bottom of this now.
And I haven't told Peter.
Supposedly it's a campaign worker,
but it's pure fiction.
Alicia...
this is politics.
Peter is vulnerable in this,
and that is why it's being used.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I have to go.
You know, you did call me.
I know.
Tomorrow night?
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Lana, I really have to go.
Kalinda, you come here,
and I feel like I'm warming you up for someone else.
You're not.
You seem good.
I'm excited about the case.
Uh, Your Honor, before we begin,
I believe there's still a question of standing.
No, Your Honor, there's no question of standing.
There is a question of Chumhum's purchase of Wicked Savage.
Yes, but first there is a question of standing
being raised by Chancellor Carlyle.
Who?
Your Honor, I am the chancellor of Chicago Polytechnic.
I'm happy for you.
Now, what do you want?
I'm here to assert the university's ownership
of the software titled Margarita Motions.
What?!
If I could point to page 42 of the university's student handbook:
"The college owns the right
"to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries
created by employees or students..."
You're kidding-- we invented this.
Yes, but on school property and using school resources.
There is a legal precedent here, your Honor.
Google was forced to negotiate with Stanford
over the rights to Google,
and the University of Illinois
sued one of the cofounders of Netscape for trademark infringement.
Therefore, we ask that the subpoena be quashed,
given that the plaintiffs' standing here is unclear.
Just give me a listen.
Uh, I'm on a case, Eli.
It's for Alicia, not Peter.
Look, Peter is being accused of sleeping
with a campaign worker, and he didn't.
I'm just trying to stop the story
before it embarrasses Alicia.
Embarrasses Alicia?
Yes.
After all she's been through, you know it will.
Just listen to the reporter's questions, that's all.
This is Kalinda, my assistant. I asked her to sit in.
Hi.
Really?
I thought we were finishing up.
Oh, no, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
If you want face time with Peter and Alicia,
I'll need to know what you're going to ask.
His assistant, huh?
Peter Florrick and one of his campaign workers
slept together on September 30.
Where?
Eli, we vetted this.
Then what's your worry?
The St. Martin.
Was she visiting him or he visiting her?
They were both there.
Campaign workers on one floor, Peter on another.
And which room did they go to?
They had a prearranged signal.
She was to go to his floor at 11:30 and knock on his door.
On how many occasions?
What's her name?
No.
Mandy, if it's true...
And if I tell you, you'll have no reason to buy the magazine.
Get me face time.
Eli told me.
Peter, let's not do this, please.
It's not true; I wanted you to know.
Seriously, Peter, I have had a very long day,
and by the end of the week,
I will have had a very long week.
Look, I have a target on my back, and this is not true.
Do you remember what you said the first time?
"It's not true."
And that's exactly why they're throwing this crap at me--
because my denials will look like lies.
It's politics.
The problem is, Peter, I don't give a damn.
Good morning, Chancellor.
What's this, Chancellor?
It's my book-- a book I wrote about
ways to improve education in America.
And what income did you derive from this book?
In royalties?
I... well, I don't have the facts and figures at my fingertips.
I do, actually.
$71,450, mostly due to students
being required to buy it as a textbook.
Now, how much of that money went to the college?
How much? You mean, of the royalties?
I don't know.
Did any portion go to the college?
I... no.
But you're a college employee, aren't you, sir?
And the student handbook here clearly states,
"College owns the rights to all works,
"Inventions, developments, and discoveries
created by employees and students."
Yes, but that's not a fair comparison.
I'm the university chancellor.
So the rules don't apply to you?
No, that's not what I said.
The college is selective in how it enforces its rules?
Oh, come on.
There is a radical difference between $71,000
in royalties and the potential millions
from the plaintiffs' voice recognition software.
Yes, thank you for prompting the good chancellor
in how to answer my question, but...
Objection, Your Honor.
I find this line of question offensive and irrelevant.
No, it isn't, Ms. Walsh; it actually isn't.
Please continue, Counselor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is Mr. Neil Gross a graduate of your university?
He is an honored graduate.
And did you know that his company Chumhum
is worth $86 billion?
Well, even if you didn't know that, you knew
that he'd given a $50 million endowment to the university.
Yes.
So... have you claimed ownership of Chumhum?
No.
Really?
But you read in his book that he created
his page-ranking hierarchy in your computer lab.
Okay, that's enough.
I'm ready to rule on standing.
It is my determination that, due to estoppel by silence
and my general disgust with the chancellor's tactics...
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me. This is my court;
you may go now. Thank you.
The college has no standing here,
and the interests of the plaintiff's suit holds sway.
Yes! Yes!
I also find that
Mr. Gross will open all pertinent aspects
of his algorithm to scrutiny...
Your Honor, we cannot allow the algorithm,
as you know...
Yes, you can.
Ms. Walsh, what you cannot do is hide behind
the skirts of trade secrets indefinitely.
I will appoint a third party
to peruse all algorithm documents,
in order to avoid competitive leaking.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes.
I know what you're doing.
Your firm's bankrupt.
You lost my competitor, Patric Edelstein,
so you're looking for another big fish.
You know I have a tendency to buy out my irritants,
hire firms who sue me,
so this-- just a little performance piece.
Well, not to toot our own horn, Mr. Gross,
but there is strategic advantage in hiring the firm
that used to represent your competition.
Although we're legally bound by attorney-client privilege,
we know how Mr. Edelstein works
and we know how to beat him.
You're right-- strategically smart--
but, you see, here's the thing:
I don't like you
and I intend to go out of my way to never hire you.
Nice talking with you.
Look, Mr. Gross,
little advice:
If you're looking for a good lawyer,
don't go with who you like.
If I can irritate you like this,
just think what I can do to your enemies.
I'm rich enough not to care.
There were 12 campaign workers at the St. Martin,
ten of them female.
Who's that?
Indira Starr, advance.
And she was at the hotel?
Yeah, why?
Kalinda, it is not true.
Peter did not sleep with her.
Eli...
I want you to look at this speech...
Hi, Peter.
Peter, you know Kalinda Sharma?
Yes, in the State's Attorney's Office.
Of course, yeah. She's helping us with, uh, Mandy Post.
Excuse me.
Uh, you want the photo?
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Sure.
You have her on this?
Yeah, Why?
She wants to be on it?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
What do I need to know here, Peter?
Nothing.
Let's go over this.
You're reluctant to reveal the Chumhum algorithm to the court.
Why is that?
Well, for the obvious reason,
it's our crown jewels.
Other companies would pay millions for access to it.
And you're here to tell the court that
you won't acquiesce to their subpoena, is that right?
Yes, but I believe I have the law on my side.
Why is that?
The First Amendment.
Oh, dear God.
Mr. Gardner. Please.
Our search engine results are protected by free speech.
To compel their release is the same as
compelling a newspaper to reveal its sources.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Therefore, you have editorial discretion, Mr. Gross?
Yes, and that is why I am resisting this subpoena.
Kalinda, hello.
Hey.
This must be your friend.
Kalinda is it?
How are you doing? I'm Nick.
He was just keeping me company. Thrilling me with his accent.
Oh, I was trying to.
So how do you two know each other?
Just friends.
Really?
You seem like more.
Well, I don't know. You seem like, uh,
adopted sisters or something.
No.
Friends from way back.
Let me get you both a drink.
Friends.
Sure.
Oh, I've just got something through.
Sorry. Will you excuse me, please?
I'm just gonna be one second.
Dyke.
Kevin Costas.
I'm a blogger.
My blog, UberTech, was awarded
one of the Top 25 Tech Blogs of 2010 by Engadget.
Congratulations. And on your blog you wrote:
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized...
it stinks."
Yes.
And how do you know it was plagiarized?
How do I know the software was?
Because it was.
'Cause it's not very good.
And you have proof they stole it?
You mean, actual proof?
No.
But I don't need it. It's my opinion.
Objection, Your Honor.
What does this have to do with the lawsuit?
Mr. Gross is claiming
editorial discretion for his search engine,
therefore he is responsible for its editorial content...
Wait a minute...
They can't have their cake and eat it too, Your Honor.
If they insist on free speech protections,
then they're responsible for that speech.
Your Honor...
No, Ms. Walsh, she's right.
Overruled.
So, Mr. Costas, you printed the accusation of plagiarism
without checking truth or falsehood?
I didn't need to.
And did Mr. Gross, or anyone from Chumhum
ask you for evidence as to the truth of your accusation?
Uh... from Chumhum?
Uh, no.
Judge, this is absurd.
Chumhum has millions of pages.
If my client is gonna be held liable for every single one...
Well, then there will be a hell of a lot of defamation suits.
Yes, Ms. Walsh.
I'm not making a free speech argument.
You are.
One million dollars.
But you have to take it now.
No consulting with Will. No second guessing.
Just business between two like minds.
No.
We're not going higher.
That's probably true.
It's one million dollars.
This firm is bankrupt.
Then negotiate with Will. Tell him.
But I'll advise him not to take it.
Why?
I've seen the evidence.
You're a businessman.
Yes. Show a businessman a winning hand,
he doesn't need to be a gambler to go all in.
I'm going all in.
Will has gotten to you.
He's put dollar signs in your eyes.
I'm trying to be the peacemaker here.
Why aren't people just upfront with what they want?
Why don't they ever just say what they mean?
Well, you have chosen a really strange time to get philosophical.
No.
It's the perfect time.
Thank you.
At first I was just...
you know, flirtatious.
Older guys like to flirt with me.
I have a nice laugh.
And then you two had sex?
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.
I told that reporter,
it's not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.

How many times did you have sex?
Maybe eight times. I don't know.
Was it always at a hotel?
No, uh, twice at his apartment.
Once, we were doing it in the bedroom and
we heard his wife coming home.
Yeah, it was like something out of a movie.
I had to hide in the bathroom.
She saw me, too.
She saw you?
Alicia saw you?
Yeah, Alicia.
But she said it was no big deal.
I mean, she's used to it.
I guess he's a real man whore.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
She was like, you can do it anywhere you want,
just not in my apartment.
But you know how it is.
We are negotiating.
Zero is not a negotiation.
Well, then throw out some numbers.
Mr. Gross, settle down.
Sorry we're late. Where are we at?
We seem to be at zero.
Well, don't forget, we've agreed not to sue for court costs.
Stop playing games, Viola.
It's settle or hand over the algorithm.
Mm... no.
I think there's a third way.
And what's that?
Have you spoken to your clients?
You're right.
I do tend to buy out my irritants.
Just not their lawyers.
Oh, Alicia, hi. We were just leaving a note.
You settled?
Mr. Gross hired us to run Wicked Savage Designs for him.
Their voice recognition software.
What happened to running your own company?
Things change.
Thank you, Alicia.
You guys were great. If we ever get in trouble again,
we will give a call.
What do you need, Eli?
Eli?
Do you and Peter have an open marriage?
I'll take that as a no.
Take it any way you want.
We interviewed the campaign worker
who supposedly slept with Peter
and she said you have an open marriage.
Well, I can't stop what Peter says.
No. She said you told her.
She said you found her
in your apartment bathroom, hiding,
and you told her not to worry about sleeping with Peter
because you have an open marriage...
just so long as it's not at your apartment.
This is all a lie?
Good.
Then that means this campaign worker isn't just lying about Peter.
She is also lying about you.
I don't know what you're getting on about this.
It isn't that hard.
I know you tried a lot of things
when I was away,
and I forgive you.
Thanks.
Yep.
But now I'm back.
And I don't want you doing anymore of that college dorm stuff.
No more... No more women.
Things change.
Some things don't change.
You belong to me.
I belong to you.
And I know where your girlfriend lives.
I'd like to see you try.
I don't think you would.
Oh, I would.
She's a federal agent.
My girlfriend...
is a federal agent.
So good luck with that.
Oh, Eli,
are we, are we doing this speech in Oak Park?
'Cause if we are,
