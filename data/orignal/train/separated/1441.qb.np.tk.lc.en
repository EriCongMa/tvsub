第三季 第四集
gloria , how many times do i have to tell you
to pull your car all the way in ?
the gate was open all night .
we live in a nice neighborhood .
what are you afraid of ? that some money &apos;s gonna fly in
and then your gardener is gonna have to rake it up ?
jay , i &apos;m going to need you to cut me a check .
what now ?
drama club trip . &quot; les miserables . &quot;
we &apos;re selling wrapping paper to raise money for the tickets .
no . no . wait . wait . slow down . what &apos;s the story exactly ?
well , jean valjean spent 19 years in prison
for stealing a loaf of bread .
the wrapping paper .
19 years for a loaf of bread ?
how good was this bread ?
it wasn &apos;t about the bread . it was about the society--
focus , people .
manny , we will buy all your wrapping paper .
no . no , we won &apos;t . no , he &apos;s got to learn to sell .
this is the best business training there is ,
hell , the best life training .
manny , write this down--
&quot; a good salesman goes after moby dick in a rowboat
and brings the tartar sauce with him . &quot;
jay is always telling me to &quot; write this down . &quot;
i don &apos;t always catch everything he says .
&quot; something , something , firm handshake . &quot;
&quot; never take the first room they show you . &quot;
not sure who &quot; they &quot; is .
and this one just says &quot; pancakes . &quot;
cam , what &apos;s this scribble on the &quot; vanity fair &quot;
about an adoption agency ?
oh , um , yeah , they called to say
they wanted to reschedule our home visit .
when ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
th @-@ this is kind of important .
well , when does it say ?
uh , well , who knows ?
it disappears into jennifer aniston &apos;s hair .
you gotta get a better system .
there is nothing wrong with my system .
ask me anything about any upcoming event .
i can tell you when and where it is .
when is the adoption agency visit ?
okay . is that a &quot; 5 &quot; or a curl ?
oh , i hope jen &apos;s finally found love .
what happened here ?
well , lily and i woke up in a french mood ,
so we decided to whip up some crepes .
when are you gonna be in the mood to wipe up some crepes ?
oh , i know , it &apos;s a little messy , but ...
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna clean it up .
okay .
i &apos;ll clean it up .
will you ?
just say what &apos;s on your mind .
you never clean up .
save the gasp .
cam , whenever you get creative in the kitchen ,
i &apos;m the one who ends up cleaning it up , okay ?
the homemade pizza , fondue , molecular gastronomy .
i &apos;m still cleaning shrimp foam out of the curtains .
okay , you know , mitchell ? just go to work , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna take lily to school , and then when i get home ,
i &apos;m gonna scrub this place like a crime scene ,
which it is , because you &apos;ve murdered joy .
hey , buddy . what &apos;s up ?
hey , dad . think fast .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
if we had that on tape ,
it &apos;d be the greatest youtube video ever !
we &apos;d get , like , a million hits . this is our double rainbow !
we need to do it again .
oh , i would , buddy , but , uh ,
your mom &apos;s all over me to change a bunch of lightbulbs .
how many moms does it take to screw on a lightbulb ?
i don &apos;t know .
none , &apos; cause they get you to do it , sucker .
i laughed , but ...
it hurt a little .
we &apos;re home !
us , too .
oh , great . you &apos;re all here .
what &apos;s up , girl ?
oh . you know that really dangerous intersection ?
where desire meets jealousy , and the result is murder ?
mnh @-@ mnh . the one where i almost killed you this morning .
oh , yeah . sorry . that was my bad . i got lost in my jams .
dangerous combo-- speed walking and speedwagon .
oh . i wasn &apos;t even trying for that .
nice .
well , i am getting us a stop sign .
i called city hall , and how is this for amazing ?
the traffic committee meets tonight .
i &apos;ve got goosebumps .
i know , right ? all i have to do is get 50 signatures ,
show up , make my case .
it &apos;s on .
i am so proud of you .
we all are . mm .
we love when mom gets on a project .
because usually the minute any of us walks in the door ,
she gives us something to do .
&quot; do your homework . clean your room . &quot;
&quot; put on pants . &quot;
like the queen &apos;s coming over . am i right ?
so when she &apos;s not around or gets busy ,
luke and i capitalize on the situation .
there you are , my good man .
squire , let &apos;s do it .
get you some !
well , i think it &apos;s awesome .
i am so glad because i could really use your help
getting these signatures .
i &apos;ll do it ,
soon as i change those lightbulbs you wanted .
great . kids ?
crud . you know , i &apos;ve got a ton of homework .
uh , science project .
haley ?
i need to get started on my college essay .
you know what ? maybe i &apos;ll write it about you .
you &apos;re just so inspirational .
girl power ! you rock .
thanks , honey .
i do rock .
stella , down .
stella , no . this is very dangerous .
okay , estella . that &apos;s it .
come here , because jay is gonna be very mad
if something happens to you .
go play with the bone . see you later .
now i can cook my empanadas .
the gate .
ay , no !
ay , no ! the gate ! the gate !
estella , come back !
hey there , mr. salesman .
can we not talk about business ?
that bad , huh ?
i gave it everything i got--
working the dimples , going big eyes .
it got me two things-- diddly and squat .
how many houses you hit ?
i don &apos;t know .
must &apos;ve been at least three .
three ? and that &apos;s your idea of the best you got ?
it was very hard on me .
i &apos;m not used to rejection ... or hills .
look , you can &apos;t quit after three houses .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not perseverance .
what are you selling ?
wrapping paper .
wrong .
you &apos;re selling christmas--
the excitement of opening presents ,
the taste of eggnog .
i do love eggnog .
look , write this down--
&quot; what &apos;s the difference between &apos; try &apos; and &apos; triumph &apos; ? &quot;
a little oomph ?
a little oomph . get it ?
of course i get it . i just said it .
hey ! i &apos;m gonna kill you when i find you , silly dog !
why don &apos;t you come back ? stella !
i have a theory .
ay , cam , thank you for helping me .
oh , it &apos;s my pleasure . stella !
stella !
oh , my god .
what ? do you see her ?
no . but i see myself in the role i was born to play .
stella !
stella !
hello ? oh , mitchell , you are not gonna believe this .
i &apos;m out helping gloria look for her dog .
i &apos;m wearing an undershirt and i &apos;m screaming &quot; stella , &quot;
just like in &quot; streetcar . &quot;
hello ?
you didn &apos;t clean the kitchen .
mitchell , i am an inadvertent stanley kowalski .
how can you not be delighted by this ?
you promised .
i was called away for an emergency .
gloria &apos;s lost her dog , and she &apos;s heartbroken .
where are you , dumb dog ?
i hope in a big , black hole .
i cannot believe that you did this to me yet again . oh .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i cooked a meal in our kitchen .
and then you left on purpose , knowing that
i would not be able to sit here without cleaning it up .
life is messy sometimes . big deal .
it gets cleaned up .
you &apos;re the one with a problem if you can &apos;t leave
a few dirty dishes for a couple hours .
o @-@ okay , fine . c @-@ cam , i &apos;m not cleaning it up .
great .
i mean it .
perfect . you know what ?
why don &apos;t you make it bigger ?
you know what ? i will .
i @-@ i ... okay , you know , get--get ready ,
because you are gonna come home to--to a giant mess .
and i will give him a giant hug when i get there .
stella !
hey , dad . think fast .
oh . wow . buddy .
i &apos;m sorry . i told you , i gotta change the lightbulbs
and then help your mom with those signatures .
never mind .
i guess it was a stupid idea anyways .
i &apos;ve always said that if my son thinks of me
as one of his idiot friends , then i &apos;ve succeeded as a dad .
if he wants to go the wrong way on the escalator , i &apos;m on board .
if he wants to go into a restaurant
and pretend we &apos;re australian .
&quot; g &apos;day mate ! &quot;
&quot; toss a few shrimp on the barbie for me and my joey . &quot;
yeah ? right ? nicole kidman ?
men at work ?
here we go . take 12 .
hey , buddy ! i &apos;m home !
hey , dad . think fast .
wow . you know , my arm &apos;s starting to hurt a little .
really ? cause my face feels great .
come on , dad . let &apos;s not turn on each other .
we could be here a while .
yeah . okay . you &apos;re right . here we go .
take 9 .
you &apos;re not even trying .
daddy , i &apos;m hungry .
what do you want , honey ?
raisins .
all right well , go get &apos; em .
it &apos;s too high , daddy .
i can &apos;t reach .
for the record , i am not a neat freak .
i @-@ in fact , in my first long @-@ term relationship ,
i was the messy one , which is why she broke up with me .
no , thanks .
okay .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . let me show you how it &apos;s done .
hi . uh , jay pritchett here .
holidays are just around the corner .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t believe in wrapping paper .
what do you mean you don &apos;t believe in wrapping paper ?
it &apos;s not bigfoot . it exists .
it &apos;s not eco @-@ friendly . it &apos;s wasteful .
no , not this stuff .
this paper was made from 100 % recycled materials .
i don &apos;t think so .
i can &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
she &apos;s an ugly little fresh bulldog
with the tiny ears and the smushy face .
what is so hard to understand ?
maybe i should translate .
i really don &apos;t like people coming to my door unannounced
while i &apos;m working on my carving .
i understand , but a stop sign is really important .
what exactly are you carving ?
hello , ma &apos;am . do you love christmas ?
actually , i &apos;m jewish .
oh , well , then you must appreciate a good value .
oh , jeez .
if you see her , let us know .
oh , my god . no , no . no , no .
are you kidding ? seriously ? !
see ? you &apos;re not keeping your head in the right position .
i know that &apos;s me , but i &apos;m not remembering any of this .
oh . those stupid neighbors !
what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t ask for a simple signature .
but it &apos;s fine for them to build a house
that looks like the beverly hillbillies just moved in .
did you do any better ?
we came close a few times ,
but you &apos;re not talking about the basketball , are you ?
phil , tell me you got some signatures .
i have to be at city hall in , like , two hours .
oh , god . haley , how about you ?
i &apos;ve been busy with my college essay .
really ? where is it ?
it &apos;s in a rough , rough draft right now .
i &apos;ve been thinking that maybe that i should--
alex has been skyping with her boyfriend since you left .
that &apos;s so not true !
thank you .
really , thank all of you so much for your help .
really ?
sometimes those things need to warm up , like the car .
phil , don &apos;t even . i have been out there ,
trying to do something good for our community ,
because let me tell you , change doesn &apos;t just happen .
it is forged by empowered women like me
and norma rae and the lady from &quot; the blind side . &quot;
do you know what the difference is between me and her ?
blind side &apos;s family had her back .
okay .
huddle up , everybody .
your mother &apos;s right .
she &apos;s the quarterback of this family ,
and we need to protect her like blind side did .
she just said the mom was blind side .
well , she &apos;s confused .
blind side was the black kid who played tight end .
offense line .
sorry . african @-@ american kid .
there she is .
ay ! stella !
ay , thank god you found my dog . thank you .
this is my dog . her name &apos;s pinky .
no , it &apos;s not . her name is stella .
it says right here on the tag . look .
uh , uh , uh , excuse me . hi , sweetie . what &apos;s your name ?
blanche .
shut up . mitchell would die .
listen , we don &apos;t know you .
you seem like a very sweet little girl ,
and right now we &apos;re forced to--
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this to you--
rely on the kindness of strangers .
i &apos;ll sell her to you for $ 200 .
that &apos;s it . give me my dog .
oh , really ? the little girl thinks because she can scream ,
she can get away with everything ? i can scream , too .
what the hell sound is that ?
coyotes must &apos;ve got a cat .
jay , can we stop now ? i &apos;m getting hungry .
you know what the problem is ? you &apos;re not hungry .
i had a carrot at 3 : 00 .
what if you couldn &apos;t feed your family
unless you made this next sale ?
what if you were gonna lose your house ?
i know i was pushing the kid hard , but here &apos;s the thing--
i &apos;m an older dad . i &apos;m not gonna be around forever .
and i &apos;ll sleep better knowing he &apos;s got something to fall back on .
come on ! let &apos;s hit another one .
i can &apos;t do it .
what ?
i don &apos;t have what it takes .
what kind of talk is that ?
it &apos;s the truth , jay .
i &apos;m not a great salesman . i &apos;m not a great businessman .
i &apos;m not you .
do you know what it &apos;s like to see all the amazing things
you &apos;ve accomplished , knowing i never will ?
how am i supposed to live up to you ?
how is anyone ?
ah , so the fish weren &apos;t biting today .
so what ? that &apos;s life .
you tried hard , and that &apos;s what matters .
yeah .
you know , i @-@ i actually need some wrapping paper .
you know where i can find some ?
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i want to do it .
you &apos;ll never go broke playing to a rich guy &apos;s ego---
write that down .
thanks so much , you guys .
maybe you should make a wish .
uh , hi . oh , i &apos;m sorry .
um , i &apos;m here for the traffic committee meeting ?
the meeting &apos;s been adjourned .
yeah . um ...
it &apos;s my birthday .
i &apos;m sorry . happy birthday .
uh , just--someone sent me to the wrong room ,
and you guys don &apos;t meet again for months ,
and this is pretty much a matter of life and death , so ...
uh , yeah , it &apos;s fine .
uh , just-- if you could make it quick .
we--it &apos;s an ice cream cake .
okay .
a @-@ actually , it &apos;s not .
what ?
no .
really ? oh , then we-- we &apos;re not in a rush , i guess .
at all . no rush . go ahead .
great . my name is claire dunphy ,
and my family and i live near
that intersection of -- - why not ? why not ?
the freezer was broken , and we couldn &apos;t keep it here .
see ? this is why i ask you to think ahead , okay ?
do you have your 50 signatures ?
uh , almost . i have 34 , but i--
oh . that &apos;s the same thing .
wow . i &apos;m confused .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
no .
no. 34 is not the same thing as 50,
just like a cake is not the same thing
as an ice cream cake .
right .
i get that . sir , i &apos;m trying to save lives here ,
mom
and i can get you the rest of the signatures .
mom . mom . mom .
mom !
oh , my god . what are you doing here ? girls .
we--we went door to door and we got you 20 more signatures .
that is so sweet of you .
well , you were freaking out at us , so ...
okay , you know , let &apos;s not ruin it .
all right , 54 signatures .
so what do you say ?
let &apos;s start saving lives one intersection at a time .
okay , thank you very much .
we will , uh , take these under advisement .
just leave &apos; em here , and thank you--
wait a minute . i know what that means .
oh , here we go .
that &apos;s washington @-@ speak for &quot; get lost . &quot;
well , um , wow , phil .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m your husband .
i &apos;m blindsiding you .
your honor , permission to approach .
not a judge .
i &apos;ll allow it .
i &apos;ll get straight to the point because this is important ,
and that appears to be an ice cream cake .
well , it &apos;s not !
okay . i present to you
&quot; stop in the name of life . &quot;
kick it .
clive bixby .
can i meet you at harry &apos;s bar in two minutes ?
baby , i can do anything in two minutes .
i &apos;ll just speed through
the intersection of greenleaf and bristol .
it &apos;s easy &apos; cause there &apos;s no stop sign .
i love being a kid .
i have my whole life ahead of me .
no !
no !
no !
okay . well ...
powerful .
and unconventional , but i believe it makes our point ,
so what do you say ?
well , the kid was all right . i didn &apos;t care for you so much .
but if i were to give a stop sign
to everybody who wanted a stop sign ... mm @-@ hmm .
this city would grind to a halt .
i understand , sir , but--
thank you , ma &apos;am .
thank you . thank you .
allow me . allow me .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i &apos;ve lived with this woman for 20 years .
if she wants a stop sign ...
there &apos;s gonna be a stop sign .
mm @-@ hmm . he &apos;s right .
listen to the man .
yeah .
still--no good ?
no bueno ?
i &apos;m home !
oh , hey . did you find stella ?
safe and sound . mm .
i did it ! i left the mess . aren &apos;t you proud of me ?
i sure am . good for you !
you know , it wasn &apos;t easy at first ,
but i just-- i took lily to the park ,
and i completely put it out of my mind .
and i think i really cleared a hurdle today .
oh , that &apos;s great . i &apos;m super proud of you ,
and you &apos;re--and you &apos;re not even tempted to clean it up now ?
no !
that &apos;s great .
no , not now that you &apos;re home .
so guess i &apos;d better get started .
yeah .
i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s so gross .
oh , my god .
what ?
i was right . you wanted me to clean it up .
oh , that &apos;s preposterous .
i will not stand here and take this from you .
oh , cam !
&quot; life is messy . i love chaos . &quot;
you are so full of it . well , you know what ?
that &apos;s all right . no worries . hey , come on .
come on . just embrace it . it &apos;s life .
oh ! okay , now that is gratuitous .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
no ! that &apos;s lily &apos;s favorite cereal .
this is ridiculous .
relax ! hey , lily ! honey , come here !
sweetheart , do you want a princess hat ?
yes ! yes ! yes !
okay .
oh . oh , okay . that--that is enough ! no !
you &apos;ve proven your point . i don &apos;t like to clean up .
it &apos;s smelly , it &apos;s sticky , and after i eat ,
i &apos;m tired , and i just want to lay down .
and you put it off , knowing that i would do it ?
yes ! are you happy ?
yes ... i ... am .
hi . i &apos;m ellen roberts from the adoption agency .
i &apos;m ... here for the home visit .
i might need to tweak my system .
hey , dad . think fast .
sacagawea !
wait , wait , wait ... i need a break .
oh ! john philip sousa !
78 views .
we are on our way .
yeah , we are .
you know what , lukey ? my dad was away a lot .
and i &apos;m not gonna do that to you .
i &apos;m gonna be the kind of dad ...
