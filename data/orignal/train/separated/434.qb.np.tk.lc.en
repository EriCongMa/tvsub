didn &apos;t come out here to play games !
bus is leaving in 5 minutes .
get your gear or it stays .
you &apos;re out here 6 days , boys .
had a chance to prove yourselves .
and what have you done ?
showed me you &apos;re a bunch of lazy sons of bitches .
i got your message .
good . what do you think ?
it presents as mass suicide .
can you prove it ?
not without visiting the campus .
that &apos;s what i thought .
i can &apos;t make an assessment without meeting the faculty and students .
i know . it--
the school is up for the federal tomlinson grant .
this does not bode well .
the director &apos;s a graduate of somerville academy , isn &apos;t he ?
yes . and he &apos;s been fighting for the government funding .
these boys killed themselves for a reason .
no one should write that off .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
somerville military academy , oceanside , florida ,
5 boys were found hanging this morning .
the bodies are at the medical examiner &apos;s now .
there &apos;s no photos ?
school personnel thought they may be still alive , so they cut them out of the trees .
jimmy burbage , phil mumford ,
jerry bowden , jack briggs , tucker calhoun .
so we &apos;re walking into a contaminated crime scene .
we don &apos;t have anything solid ?
&quot; we &apos;re sorry &quot; was carved in a tree branch nearby .
this happened on campus ?
no , in the woods about an hour away .
how long were they out there ?
6 days .
without supervision ?
it was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen .
what drove them to suicide ?
a freshman cadet , bailey shelton ,
hung himself 2 weeks ago in his room .
identical bed sheet , hangman &apos;s knot .
who takes sheets camping ?
they would if it was the plan .
could be domino effect .
the campus would have been on high alert after the first one ,
so the kids wait until they &apos;re alone in the woods .
they must have made some kind of pact .
and there &apos;s something else .
6 kids went on the trip . only 5 were found .
the school officials confirm that josh redding is still missing .
so maybe he chickened out of the pact .
or was never a part of it .
and the campus is completely off the grid . no internet .
i can help with that .
which is why you &apos;re coming with us .
and so am i.
isn &apos;t somerville the director &apos;s alma mater ?
yes . the academy has enjoyed a spotless reputation ,
so the hope is to keep the investigation in house .
i imagine there &apos;s a lot of concern for josh .
he &apos;s been in those woods almost a week .
so how &apos;s he surviving ?
&quot; things do not change . we change . &quot;
henry david thoreau .
there &apos;s still no sign of josh redding .
we &apos;ll join the search .
so , the somerville academy was founded
during world war ii .
it is hard @-@ core old school .
they don &apos;t even have a website .
socioeconomic breakdown &apos;s all over the map .
yeah , so are the ages .
students are 12 to 18 years old ,
on the same campus , in the same dorms .
same personnel has worked there for a lifetime .
ron massey has been superintendent for 30 years .
he &apos;s an alum , as the majority of the staff there .
lieutenant tawes has been his second in command
this whole time .
these type of places have their own infrastructure .
if it ain &apos;t broken , they ain &apos;t gonna fix it .
that &apos;s probably why they banned modern technology .
they didn &apos;t need it back then , they don &apos;t need it now .
aggressive motto--
&quot; vivere est vincere . &quot;
to live is to conquer .
the school raises soldiers .
suicide is not part of that mantra .
bailey shelton was only 13 years old .
he was one of the youngest students there .
his death is probably the key to the others .
colonel massey ,
erin strauss .
this is the team i spoke with you about .
agent hotchner .
this is agent morgan , agent jareau ,
dr. spencer reid , and penelope garcia .
so shouldn &apos;t the flag be at half @-@ mast ?
i haven &apos;t told the boys yet .
do they know who we are ?
i &apos;ll tell them when the time is right .
i &apos;ve called all of the parents .
they &apos;re driving from up and down the east coast .
in fact , josh redding &apos;s have just arrived .
i &apos;d like to speak with them .
they &apos;re in the chapel .
how are they ?
as you &apos;d expect .
all right , i &apos;ll get started .
cadet .
any leads on josh ?
in that terrain ,
he &apos;s only capable of moving a mile an hour .
puts him in a 60 @-@ mile radius .
that &apos;s 3,600 square miles to cover .
tawes knows those woods better than anybody .
we &apos;ve got two agents meeting him
and we &apos;ll start the investigation here .
where &apos;s the place with the most outlets ?
best bet is in the library .
thank you .
we &apos;d like to start with bailey shelton &apos;s suicide .
do you have a copy of the medical examiner &apos;s report ?
i don &apos;t .
but there was no question he hung himself .
well , the nuances can tell us a lot .
the doctor &apos;s receiving the last of the bodies now .
i expect he &apos;s got his hands full .
i &apos;ll speak to him later .
of course .
it would be helpful to us
to know what bailey &apos;s last day was like .
i &apos;ll show you .
he stayed in the plebes hall .
his father took all of his belongings after the suicide .
josh &apos;s items are as they were .
josh stayed with the first years ?
he &apos;s the brigade commander .
bailey &apos;s suicide hit him hard .
were all the victims friends of bailey &apos;s ?
brotherhood is the very price and condition
of man &apos;s survival .
carlos romulo .
all of my boys are brothers .
there &apos;s tucker calhoun &apos;s parents .
excuse me .
if the boys were so vulnerable ,
why did they send them into the woods ?
because it was time for their survival test .
we have a docket .
it &apos;s been only two weeks since the initial suicide .
you couldn &apos;t postpone this trip ?
classes were canceled the day after bailey died .
but men are lost in battle all the time .
this isn &apos;t battle , and these aren &apos;t men .
they are when they leave here .
how many suicides have you seen ?
just these .
so part of the mission was unsupervised ?
for a week .
but you came back 6 days later .
standard procedure to check in if the weather &apos;s extreme .
had lightning and thunder last night .
the boys didn &apos;t have any way to communicate with you ?
smoke signal .
seriously ?
basic survival skills , ma &apos;am .
we teach them to follow their instincts , not rely on technology .
no radio , no weapons .
well , survival courses like these
often trigger a fight or flight response .
it looks like that &apos;s what happened to josh .
who slept here ?
don &apos;t know . they &apos;re all identical .
whoever was here took off .
and it &apos;s secluded .
did josh redding isolate himself a lot ?
i suppose .
he was a loner .
and why is that ?
he didn &apos;t want to be at somerville in the first place .
why did you send josh here ?
because he was getting into a lot of trouble .
and he was always angry and ...
he was being a teenager .
you were gone , will .
all the time .
he was nearly 6 feet tall by the time he was 14 .
with a bad temper ,
and he was punching holes in walls ,
and he wouldn &apos;t listen to me anymore .
he could be belligerent .
but this--
this was extreme .
why ?
we had to force him .
what are you doing ? let me go !
we &apos;re helping you , josh .
mom , dad , please , don &apos;t let them do this !
they &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
dad , please !
i was afraid he was gonna hurt himself .
or someone else if we didn &apos;t get him some help .
how was josh taking bailey &apos;s suicide ?
we only talked once after that .
phone calls are a privilege here .
was that difficult for josh ?
josh has never been much of a talker ,
but i think he felt a real responsibility for bailey
and the other boys in the hall .
did he ever tell you why
bailey may have killed himself ?
no .
mr. redding .
how are you gonna get my boy back here ?
these beds are all 3 feet apart
and there &apos;s absolutely no privacy .
how did bailey hang himself without anybody noticing ?
apparently he did it in here .
he used josh &apos;s room ?
according to massey ,
josh offered bailey a lot of support .
he told you that ?
yes , when we spoke .
is that a problem ?
is there anything else he mentioned ?
the boys come in here just to sleep . it &apos;s why it &apos;s so minimal .
strauss , what , are you on the board or something ?
i just saw the campus same as you .
it &apos;s hardly prison .
these kids are told what to wear , what to say , and when to eat .
this goes against the very nature of these boys .
they &apos;re all looking for some type of control in their lives ,
and this place strips them of that .
and suicide is the ultimate power ?
isn &apos;t it ?
well , at least the boys felt enough remorse to write &quot; we &apos;re sorry . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t trump taking your own life .
what is it ?
but i guess i can buy that the other kids
couldn &apos;t hear bailey hang himself .
josh was laying right here .
i &apos;ve never seen a mass suicide apology .
maybe they knew it would help their parents .
could be confessing other sins .
who was in this tree ?
tucker calhoun .
good cadet .
looks like josh has doubled back a few times .
but the dogs can &apos;t find him .
is he familiar with these woods ?
all first years come here for a mission .
josh tried to run away back then but didn &apos;t get far .
none of them do .
but after 3 more years of training ...
he didn &apos;t weigh himself down with supplies .
smart .
we taught him well .
colonel , it &apos;s been 6 days since the suicides .
why hasn &apos;t josh come back to campus ?
he &apos;s got trust issues .
i thought he was doing well .
too smart for his own good .
the most dangerous kind .
dangerous to whom ?
himself . boys like josh reject the lessons of men .
his generation has little respect for their elders .
does that include you ?
we &apos;ve been working on it .
all the first years start in the laundry room .
it teaches them responsibility .
ten @-@ hut !
bailey finished his rotation
and walked back to his bunk .
so he was still here for bed check ?
it wasn &apos;t the first time .
was he punished for being late ?
if you &apos;re suggesting that bailey killed himself
because of a talking to , that &apos;s absurd .
that could depend on what you said .
he understood i was disappointed .
were the victims &apos; bunks made before they went into the woods ?
each and every morning .
so where did they get the sheets to hang themselves ?
carry on .
come on , baby . come on .
jeez , you scared me .
i thought you were a ghost .
you know , older buildings like this
emit a low enough frequency that you can &apos;t consciously hear .
because the sensory overload can &apos;t be explained ,
it wreaks havoc with your emotions ,
inducing fear , panic , and dread ,
hence the feeling of being haunted .
what about the visions ?
your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing .
that said , i do know a 3 @-@ year @-@ old boy
that once met a friendly apparition named leverett saltonstall .
he was nice ?
very nice .
you &apos;d think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms .
it &apos;s not in the basement ?
it &apos;s on the opposite side of campus .
that &apos;s so strange .
yeah .
leaves of 3 , let them be .
oh , man . poison ivy . alcohol swabs , stat .
thank you . you know , if i &apos;ve got it , so do you .
i &apos;m italian . it knows better . where &apos;s massey ?
he &apos;s meeting with the victims &apos; families . they &apos;re arriving now .
jj , how are josh &apos;s parents ?
upset . they sent him here to keep him away from trouble .
tawes made it seem like these guys are the only family they have .
you make it sound like a cult .
uh , it kind of is .
this is a well @-@ respected institution .
they &apos;re not on trial .
the integral part of the investigation
is going to be understanding what these victims lived every day .
and with who .
bailey shelton killed himself in josh redding &apos;s room .
was josh in the room that night ?
according to the records .
i will dig for dirt .
dave , you find anything in the woods ?
josh &apos;s tent was secluded .
his things were left behind . he just took off .
massey said he never got any respect from josh .
and josh &apos;s own parents said he was impossible to control .
his course load indicates increased isolation .
isolated , smart , angry .
that could be a budding psychopath .
what are you saying ?
josh redding killed his classmates ?
then he &apos;s not missing . he &apos;s on the run .
and he was been for a week .
one hell of a head start .
with all the skills he could ever need .
stand ... a @-@ ten @-@ hut !
persent ... arms !
order ... arms !
colonel , any sign of josh ?
tawes was out there all night .
the volunteers have spread out to the next county .
where do you think he &apos;d go ?
to higher ground . but we would have seen him by now .
sir , you said it was josh
who found bailey hanging in his room , correct ?
when he woke up , yes .
you didn &apos;t find it to be odd that josh could sleep through that ?
what are you saying ?
josh is the only person in common with all these deaths .
you think josh killed bailey ?
it &apos;s a possibility .
i sent a murderer into the woods .
whoever did this wanted us to find them just like bailey shelton .
ok , so how did he do it ?
how did josh control 5 strong kids ?
josh supervised the cadets both in the bunk and the laundry room .
that could explain how the sheets got out .
yeah , so what does &quot; we &apos;re sorry &quot; mean
if it wasn &apos;t written for suicide ?
what if josh wanted them to apologize for something ?
for their sins ?
there &apos;s no record of bad behavior ,
but all of these guys were alpha males .
the were all upperclassmen who might have bullied bailey .
the message was carved under tucker calhoun &apos;s tree for a reason .
yeah . we need to know more about that kid .
what are you looking at ?
the m.e. &apos; s report .
bilateral fracture of the pars interarticular of the c2 vertebra .
what &apos;s that ?
classic hangman &apos;s fracture ,
but only one of the 5 victims had it .
which one ?
tucker calhoun .
jeez , who is this guy ?
the others suffered rotational fractures , hanging was secondary .
staging the crime scene .
josh is more sophisticated than we thought .
and vindictive .
he wanted tucker to suffer .
the question is why .
tawes thinks he &apos;s on a rescue mission .
he still is .
we &apos;ve got an enemy out there .
someone who killed 6 of my boys .
we need to figure out why .
we need to start with everyone who knows josh .
... march !
no , ma &apos;am , josh didn &apos;t have friends .
why is that ?
it depends on who you ask , sir .
what was his relationship with tucker calhoun ?
josh is straight up . this place never broke him .
no matter how hard they tried .
who tried to break him ? tucker ?
a cadet will not lie , cheat , steal ,
or tolerate those who do .
you &apos;ve got an honor code .
my guess is not everyone lives by it .
you do .
ma &apos;am . sir .
right face !
forward march !
they all gonna be like that ?
not all of them .
&quot; we shall defend our island ,
&quot; whatever the cost may be ,
&quot; we shall fight on the beaches ,
&quot; we shall fight on the landing grounds ,
&quot; we shall fight in the fields and in the streets ,
&quot; we shall fight in the hills ,
&quot; we shall never surrender .
&quot; we shall defend our island ,
whatever the cost may be . &quot;
why the hell would josh hurt them ?
has josh been more distant this year ?
well , his course load is extreme .
did he specifically complain about anyone to you ?
i already told you no .
you said he was frustrated being saddled with the younger cadets ?
that boy bailey cried himself to sleep every damn night .
maybe josh had had enough of that .
he met him outside .
bailey &apos;s father couldn &apos;t come into this building .
so josh folded is clothes , his towels , everything ,
all so that his dad wouldn &apos;t have to walk past this room .
that &apos;s who my son is .
that &apos;s who my son is .
is it true josh killed them all ?
do you think he did ?
i wouldn &apos;t fool with josh .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
he &apos;s a big guy .
you ever see him fight ?
all the time .
what about josh and tucker calhoun ?
did they ever get into it ?
tucker was an ass .
he used to come in here
and pee on the sheets after we washed them .
did he do that on the night
that bailey shelton committed suicide ?
the bastard did it every night .
do you think josh wanted to punish those kids
for picking on bailey ?
sure . but he wasn &apos;t supposed to be on that trip , anyway .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s a leadership reward .
you gotta have at least 20 points to go .
but josh only had 16 .
points ?
they &apos;re posted .
more points , more rewards .
how many do you have ?
negative 5 .
good luck .
thanks for the help .
no one told us about a point system .
so tucker calhoun has the most points .
who approves them ?
massey .
well , maybe tucker was his little pet .
leader of everything .
that comes with an attitude .
steamroller types like that ,
don &apos;t let anybody get in their way .
nothing was nice about that kid .
it sounds like he strong @-@ armed everybody .
well , then the points are for bad behavior ,
only they &apos;re not calling it that .
we should look at the points
of everyone who died in those woods .
my guess is they were all bullies .
except for josh .
hotch , is something going on with strauss ?
why ?
well , she &apos;s awfully protective of this place .
she &apos;s got pressure from above .
you sure it &apos;s nothing else ?
she doesn &apos;t like the field .
really .
any word from josh ?
no .
colonel ,
we need to speak to bailey shelton &apos;s parents .
well , his mother died years ago .
i could get hold of his father .
do that , please .
what &apos;s going on ?
josh had contact with bailey &apos;s father the day he died .
and you think he could give you
behavioral clues about josh ?
it &apos;s all we have right now , strauss .
the man just lost his son .
do you really think he &apos;s going to remember how josh acted ?
by all means , i &apos;m open to other suggestions .
massey knows his students better than anyone .
why not trust him ?
because all massey wants right now is for this to go away .
he &apos;ll tell us whatever he thinks we want to hear .
oh , hell .
what the hell was he doing way out here ?
it isn &apos;t exactly the kind of place he &apos;d stumble upon .
do you think josh built this trap ?
right out of the somerville handbook .
he even used his poncho to cover it .
he lured chris shelton here .
the body was still warm . probably died just a few hours ago .
so josh couldn &apos;t be far away .
tawes already took off . thinks he can find him .
a little help ?
so why would josh want bailey &apos;s father dead ?
the duffel &apos;s from somerville .
it &apos;s got bailey &apos;s stuff in it--
and these .
bed sheets .
he &apos;s the one who hung those boys .
ok , so he blamed them
for bullying his son ,
and josh escaped .
josh wasn &apos;t supposed to be out here in the first place .
this trap was to protect himself .
but this place isn &apos;t on any map .
how did bailey &apos;s dad find it ?
somebody tipped him off .
i make a promise to watch after these boys .
in many ways they &apos;re my own .
then something like this happens .
colonel , so you &apos;re saying josh was in his room
the night that bailey hung himself ?
what is it with you people ?
i &apos;ve already told agent morgan .
was josh in his room ?
yes .
23 cadets sleep in that building .
they &apos;re saying he wasn &apos;t there .
they &apos;re lying .
but that &apos;s against your code .
they haven &apos;t been here long
enough to understand the importance of it .
did josh find bailey in the laundry room after that check ?
bailey was his responsibility .
and who else was there ?
no one .
are we finished ?
tucker calhoun liked to pick on bailey .
was he there ?
no .
josh didn &apos;t have enough points to go on the trip .
why did you send him ?
he needed the challenge .
tell me this--
did josh kill chris shelton in the woods ?
he was being chased ,
in which case it was self @-@ defense .
josh killed a man .
any advice on how to tell his parents ?
prentiss said mr . shelton had a cell phone .
i &apos;m gonna need to see that .
doesn &apos;t the school have a cell phone ?
mm @-@ mmm . goes against their policy , remember ?
so is playing favorites . you know , a man like massey
sets rules but is the first to break them .
he &apos;s been left alone to run
these kids &apos; lives and nobody questions him .
oh , man , that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that .
his policies are a combination of many other philosophies .
i &apos;m not sure where his actual leadership lies .
only that it does ... lie , that is .
it &apos;s a joke .
good joke .
oh , my gosh .
the school does have a cell phone .
only it &apos;s not listed under massey .
the account was opened ... by tawes .
if massey &apos;s lying about something as simple as a cell phone ,
what else is he hiding ?
i met chris shelton when he claimed his son &apos;s body .
this is the last thing i expected .
multiple points of entry from the spears .
he still wears his wedding ring .
bailey was all he had left .
he &apos;d do anything to protect him .
i &apos;m not sure about that .
bailey &apos;s trachea showed signs of scarring .
he &apos;d attempted suicide before ?
no . it was internal damage .
he had stress to his heart and lungs
that isn &apos;t typical in someone his age .
it &apos;s not in your report .
it wasn &apos;t related to the c.o.d.
how old are the injuries ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
then you assume his father was abusive ?
someone was .
i didn &apos;t think much of it
till i saw similar scars on the other boys .
including blisters and burns on their hands ,
on all of them ?
their scars were much older , but yes . identical .
sir , may i ?
when did you decide where the boys would be camping ?
the day tawes dropped them off .
no one else knew ?
no need .
you didn &apos;t write it down anywhere ?
we don &apos;t use maps of that terrain .
you &apos;re expected to know it .
mr. shelton must have been quite upset when you saw him .
of course he was .
who did he blame ?
what ?
for his son &apos;s suicide . who did he blame ?
i have no idea .
well , the guilt must have manifested itself elsewhere .
was it you ?
excuse me ?
he was a desperate widower
who put his son in your hands . he trusted you ,
and look what happened .
ma &apos;am ...
what ?
we &apos;re trying to help him and he &apos;s keeping things from us .
i have cooperated fully .
did you blame someone ?
josh redding ? tucker calhoun ?
this is ridiculous .
oh , for god sakes , colonel !
he didn &apos;t just find that campsite all by himself .
it &apos;s time you leave .
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t have the patience for this .
he &apos;s clearly hiding something .
all due respect , ma &apos;am ,
have you been drinking ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
strauss , we have one shot at this .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
well , if he smelled what i can smell
on your breath right now , the credibility
of this investigation would be compromised .
the organ damage is severe ,
like the boys have been suffocated ,
but what about the blisters
the youngest cadets probably have the freshest scars .
all right , well , we &apos;re gonna need one of them to admit it .
hotch , she &apos;s drinking .
strauss ?
yeah . she needs help , man .
she could blow this case .
what happened ?
she laid into massey .
she actually said the kind of things i would have said .
and for a minute i was like , ok , good .
she &apos;s finally on our side .
but then i smelled it , hotch .
i asked you if something was going on .
you partnered me with her .
morgan , she was getting help .
i &apos;m gonna have to call e.a.p.
but this is not--
what ? this is not about me ?
is that what you were gonna say ?
you know how many times i &apos;ve heard that , hotch ?
well , i am tired of it .
you keep telling me that i have problems trusting people .
well , from where i &apos;m standing ,
you &apos;re the one who can &apos;t trust anyone with anything .
any sign of josh ?
tawes is still looking .
i need to find students who are having trouble with authority .
ok , i can do that .
but i gotta tell you , they post rewards
faster than they do demerits .
all right , well , look for kids who had disciplinary issues
before they came here .
ok . i got a few .
all right , did any of them have class with bailey shelton ?
no , but each of the plebes have laundry duty . does that help ?
their dorm is the farthest point from the laundry room .
why are they so isolated ?
the m.e. said bailey had blisters and burns ,
fingertips were raw , his trachea had internal scarring .
that &apos;s awful .
guys , that could be damage done
inside an industrial @-@ size dryer .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s how massey &apos;s breaking these boys .
hey , bailey .
tucker . tucker , don &apos;t , please .
please , tucker . please .
please , tucker . please !
please ! stop it !
please stop it ! i can &apos;t breathe !
let him out !
go , bailey , run !
no . in all the materials it
says they don &apos;t believe in corporal punishment .
bailey writes about each of those boys and how they bullied him .
his father must have read it and wants revenge .
does it mention josh ?
not at all .
then why would chris shelton go after him ?
what if massey lied to chris shelton ?
and set josh up .
and he convinced shelton
that josh was responsible for bailey &apos;s suicide .
that still doesn &apos;t explain how he found the secluded woods .
wait , where &apos;s mr . shelton &apos;s phone ?
it &apos;s right here .
it &apos;s got a couple of contacts on it ,
somerville academy being one of them .
any unknowns ? tawes has a cell .
no way . lieutenant no tech ?
there &apos;s one unknown . it &apos;s a text .
it looks like , uh , phone numbers .
what are they ?
252 @-@ 5727 ...
and 802 @-@ 8448 .
those aren &apos;t phone numbers . that &apos;s latitude and longitude .
right where those boys were camping .
massey &apos;s withheld information at every step along the way .
he &apos;s not to be trusted .
what &apos;s your theory ?
he &apos;s created a dysfunctional and abusive environment
in which children like bailey shelton and others
are repeatedly abused .
josh is a protector type .
his power was taken away the night bailey killed himself .
we believe that &apos;s when everything shifted .
josh &apos;s parents said he &apos;s been withdrawn since bailey &apos;s suicide .
there &apos;s a good chance that &apos;s because he was planning his escape .
josh didn &apos;t have enough points to go into the woods ,
but massey sent him anyway .
why would massey give josh the opportunity to escape ?
he wouldn &apos;t . he had another agenda .
massey texted chris shelton the coordinates for the campsite ,
not to hurt all the boys , but to take out josh .
but he didn &apos;t count on josh fighting back .
and he underestimated the power of chris shelton &apos;s revenge .
staging the murders to look
exactly like bailey &apos;s death was a message .
to who ?
to massey .
chris shelton wanted massey to lose his sons , too .
josh knows massey has secrets ,
and he &apos;s the only person who can bring the school down .
and now massey will do anything to destroy josh .
sir .
have you found him yet ?
negative , sir .
you finish this . understand ?
yes , sir .
we need to find josh before tawes does .
tawes has a massive head start .
josh is close and has a plan . how would he escape ?
get to higher ground .
what &apos;s the fastest way out ?
he &apos;d look for wheels . how did chris shelton get there ?
he probably drove his own car . we didn &apos;t see any atvs .
chris shelton drives a truck .
did you see one on the road on the way in ?
no .
where &apos;s the next closest road ?
well , it &apos;s a trek . it &apos;s at least a few miles north
of where the body was just found .
that leaves 3 likely areas where he would have parked .
mm @-@ mmm . you didn &apos;t find any keys , did you ?
because josh probably took them .
all right , we need to divide up .
come on .
i &apos;ve waited 3 years for this .
you little bitch .
tawes , don &apos;t do it . uhh !
it &apos;s over .
yes , mrs . jarvis .
i understand your concerns ,
but we &apos;re all fine .
soldiers , ma &apos;am .
call anytime .
colonel ron massey ,
you &apos;re under arrest .
i &apos;ve done nothing .
you texted chris shelton the coordinates of the campsite .
that makes you an accessory to murder .
texted ?
ok , fine .
you had tawes do it .
why would i do that ?
because you had no power or control over josh ,
and you couldn &apos;t handle that .
the problem is , he wasn &apos;t gonna go away quietly .
he wanted you to pay for all those years of abuse .
no one will believe josh .
he &apos;s a troubled boy .
he &apos;s a grown man , colonel .
you should be proud .
&quot; beware , so long as you live ,
of judging men by their outward appearance . &quot;
jean de la fontaine .
you got a minute ?
yeah .
do you have the after @-@ action report ?
no .
i need it on my desk by the morning .
i &apos;ll give it to the director .
pardon ?
it &apos;s time for you to admit that you need some help .
i don &apos;t take orders from you , aaron .
you put my team in jeopardy .
is that what you told him , agent morgan ?
you compromised the integrity of the unit .
i did no such thing .
open the drawer , ma &apos;am .
this is absurd .
aaron .
aaron , what are you doing ?
one call to the e.a.p. and everything will be all right .
in what world will this be all right ?
you have no idea what this is going to do to me .
agent morgan will make sure that you get checked in privately .
and for that you should be grateful .
