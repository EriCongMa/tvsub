i still feel like we &apos;re rushing this .
i &apos;m not the one calling the shots .
who are you ?
i &apos;m lyndon james . nate doesn &apos;t exist .
mona has people watching their every move .
there &apos;s no way that she has someone watching all of us .
we can put an end to this .
he &apos;s the father of my son .
yeah , he deserves to know that .
i need some time to sort this all out .
if he figures out that i &apos;m lying to him--
he won &apos;t .
everything okay ?
it &apos;s my powerhouse potion .
aria knows that you saw alison that night .
i swear , i didn &apos;t hurt alison .
last chance to save yourself .
yes , it is .
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
will you just tell me that what i saw tonight wasn &apos;t real ?
please tell me .
spencer needs to talk to her sister .
okay , but she needs to talk to one of us first .
i &apos;ve tried her , like , three times with no answer .
yeah . i haven &apos;t heard from her either ,
and neither has hanna .
i wonder if we should even tell her at all .
do you remember when we thought melissa was torturing us ?
aria , your dad said that he saw melissa
outside ali &apos;s house the night she was murdered .
i don &apos;t think she was out for an evening stroll .
she must know something .
i know , i just ... think we should hold off .
i &apos;ve gotta go . i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
come in .
hey . i thought you were coming back downstairs .
i have to work super early tomorrow .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s for you .
it came in this morning ,
but i wasn &apos;t sure if i should give it to you or not .
why ? what is it ?
james family ... ?
i don &apos;t know a james family in chicago .
wasn &apos;t that nate &apos;s real name ?
look , honey , do you want me just to take it
down to the police station ?
no .
really , &apos; cause i could just
have one of the police officers open it for you .
mom , you just started working there .
they &apos;re gonna ask you a million questions about ...
me , about maya , about nate , and ...
why i ever trusted him .
look , i never should have brought this up here .
no , don &apos;t take it . i want to open it .
why did he have these ?
these are all things i gave to ali .
maya must have found them in ali &apos;s house
and tried to give them back to me .
look , sweetie , just put the stuff away and come downstairs .
no , no , i &apos;m fine . i ...
i just hate the thought of him touching any of this .
why would they send this to me ?
i guess they &apos;re just doing what they can .
you know , they couldn &apos;t undo what their son did , so ...
i should have just opened that myself .
look , are you sure you don &apos;t wanna just come downstairs ?
not tonight . i &apos;m really tired .
i should probably just go to bed .
all right .
明天呢
不确定 回头告诉你
why are you sitting in the dark ?
i &apos;m not .
your arm still bothering you ?
not so much .
how did you hurt yourself again ?
it was stupid . i just slipped in gym .
well , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s
something a doctor should take a look at ?
mom , seriously , i &apos;m fine .
i can type with one hand .
well , clearly , you need two to wash a pot .
typing is not scraping .
how &apos;s school going ?
is it still difficult to see mona every day ?
we only have two classes together .
two &apos;s a lot .
if it &apos;s distracting , i can talk to mr. tamborelli
and help you transfer--
mom , she &apos;d still be there .
i &apos;m not gonna avoid going down every hallway .
i understand .
i @-@ i &apos;m just trying to protect--
why do you think i need protection ?
i meant ... to protect your education .
is there something else i need to know about ?
is it happening again ?
hanna ? no , there &apos;s nothing .
i just don &apos;t need anyone else protecting me , okay ?
one caped crusader is enough .
who &apos;s wearing the cape ? caleb ?
i have to take a shower .
has caleb been tangling with mona ?
&quot; tangling &quot; ?
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
has mona said anything to you recently ,
or done something to make-- ?
no .
he just doesn &apos;t trust her .
he thinks she should be watched .
you know , i @-@ i think i am gonna call mr. tamborelli .
don &apos;t . i can deal with mona and caleb .
just ... leave it alone .
i &apos;m glad to hear that you &apos;re getting her help .
like i said , i just hope that she makes a full recovery ,
and i know that my daughter feels the same way .
thank you .
you too , mr. sorenson .
well , i just got off the phone with meredith &apos;s father .
wow . that must have been weird .
turns out meredith has a long history of ...
issues .
he thinks that she stopped taking her meds ,
and i told him that we didn &apos;t want to see her punished ,
we wanted to see her treated .
that is still what you want , right ?
yeah , but ... can she be treated in another state ,
like ... alaska ?
i won &apos;t let her anywhere near my family .
she never should have been in the first place .
you know , when we first moved into this house ,
we didn &apos;t have money for a furnace ,
and it was winter , so we bundled you up in sweaters .
you looked like this ...
big ball of yarn ,
rolling from room to room .
and we never used the fireplace ,
&apos;cause i was scared that we &apos;d turn our backs
and you &apos;d get burned .
i knew that my one job on this earth was to make sure
that you didn &apos;t get hurt .
and i haven &apos;t done a very good job ...
have i ?
still recovering ?
from the anniversary dinner .
yeah . yeah .
was he surprised ?
mm @-@ hmm . it was a really big surprise .
where were you last night ? were you with caleb ?
no , he &apos;s being really weird .
every time i try to make plans with him ,
he says he &apos;s busy , but he won &apos;t tell me what he &apos;s doing .
why don &apos;t you just ask him ? be honest .
wow . it &apos;s like the world &apos;s fattest man giving dieting tips .
hello ! you &apos;re the one who &apos;s
sitting on a secret the size of the &quot; natterhorn &quot; !
okay , if you &apos;re talking about fitz and the kid ,
i &apos;m gonna tell him today .
and the goal was never to keep it from him .
i @-@ i &apos;d wake up every morning with the intention of telling him ,
and then i &apos;d go to sleep every night feeling guilty that i didn &apos;t .
at least you have your afternoons free .
nice bit of support , hanna .
oh , and by the way , it &apos;s &quot; matterhorn . &quot; muh .
aren &apos;t you the one that &apos;s supposed to be correcting her ?
what ?
hey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
uh , nothing . we didn &apos;t really get much of an anniversary
&apos;cause toby had to get up early for work the next day .
that sucks .
yeah , it does .
listen , um , i &apos;m gonna skip the brew today
&apos;cause i have a lot of reading to catch up on ,
for english , so i &apos;ll catch you guys at lunch .
hey , em .
hey .
so , can we see it ?
the stuff from his family ?
look , if it &apos;s , like ,
cards and stuff you wrote to ali ,
you don &apos;t have to show us .
it &apos;s fine .
so , did spencer tell you about the key that i dropped ?
no , hanna did .
said you guys want to turn it in to the cops-- ?
so , what do you think ?
i think that the mold from my basement
killed some of your brain cells .
guys , we are not prepared to tell the cops about &quot; a. &quot;
i guess you &apos;re right .
mnh . i always hated biology .
who cares how a cell divides ? it just does .
i didn &apos;t know that you and ali were in bio together .
we weren &apos;t .
i lent her my notes to study for the exam .
then how &apos;d you have the time to write these ?
this is definitely alison &apos;s handwriting .
yeah , but that &apos;s not mine .
wait . who &apos;s &quot; the beach hottie &quot; ?
what ?
&quot; you need to tell the beach hottie tonight . &quot;
then ali says , &quot; no way , he &apos;ll freak out . &quot;
what are they talking about ?
i want to know who they &apos;re talking about . turn the page .
that &apos;s not spencer &apos;s writing , either .
but i recognize it .
who does the &quot; g &apos;s &quot; like that ?
my grandma .
forget the &quot; g. &quot; look at the &quot; t. &quot;
there &apos;s someone in here that we do know .
why is alison writing about toby ?
hey . so i was just wondering
if you &apos;ll be home around two p.m.
i &apos;ve got a free period after lunch
and wanted to stop by so we could talk .
uh , call me . love you .
just go now . meet him there .
sooner you do it , the better you &apos;ll feel .
just don &apos;t know what else it &apos;s gonna take .
you stuck a wet brain in her locker .
she still showed up the next day with a smile on her face .
fine . i &apos;ll figure it out .
caleb , i just said i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;ll be there around seven .
it &apos;s off route 6 . i know it .
hey . i been looking for you .
did you get my text ?
uh , yeah .
yeah , you said that you found some of
ali &apos;s writing in an old notebook ?
it &apos;s an entire conversation between ali and a friend ,
but none of us recognize the friend &apos;s handwriting .
sorry .
i have to get to class .
you don &apos;t get it .
ali wasn &apos;t sharing makeup tips with this person .
they were talking about
a guy that ali was secretly involved with .
they call him the beach hottie .
was ian ever a lifeguard ?
i don &apos;t know , but melissa might . okay ?
sorry , em , i &apos;ve really got to get to class .
spencer ...
ali was scared of this guy ,
or at least scared to tell him something .
okay , well , good luck figuring it out .
what ? !
maybe she was just scared
to tell him that she was slutting it up
in three different zip codes in one summer .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that ali wasn &apos;t loyal .
to any of us .
so why do we continue to be loyal to her ?
i mean , why should we care what happens to her ?
what happened to her ?
because we do .
care .
i think that i need to learn to stop .
wait .
read .
alison visited toby after he was shipped off to juvie .
what is this ?
you know exactly what it is .
it &apos;s time to quit the pen pal routine .
what ?
clearly your time in cellblock four
has done great things for your literary skills ,
but this needs to stop .
i didn &apos;t write these .
listen .
i drove all the way up here
and just got a triple @-@ x pat down by security .
the least you can do is save me the trouble of being lied to .
why are you so convinced that it &apos;s me ?
pretty sure jenna would love to see your head on a stick .
jenna would be pretty happy to see anything , i imagine .
your step @-@ sis was going through surgery
when some of these were sent .
you wanna know how it turned out ?
she &apos;s still combing her hair with an electric toothbrush .
you can go now .
you know , i wasn &apos;t the only one outside that garage .
why aren &apos;t you harassing my friends ?
you know what ?
i wish i knew who wrote those notes .
i &apos;d offer my services .
you and your posse deserve a lot worse .
i bet you wish you &apos;d kissed me when you had the chance .
you okay ?
spence , what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re not upset because ali tried to hook up with toby , are you ?
who even knows if she did ?
just because she wrote it down doesn &apos;t mean--
i @-@ i haven &apos;t told you guys the truth .
what do you mean ? what truth ?
that toby and i broke up
last night .
you did ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m not really ready to talk about it .
can we ... please just keep it between us ?
yeah .
thanks .
it &apos;s just not that simple .
i mean , she became part of a group .
they influenced her .
i think she just called him out to punish him .
well , maybe at first , sure ,
but i think she really started to believe in her own lie .
能来公园见我吗 -艾瑞亚
spencer .
are you all right ?
spencer .
i need to go !
go where ?
home .
is something wrong ?
do you want me to call your mom ?
for what ?
you can &apos;t just storm out
of the classroom without a legitimate excuse .
i don &apos;t want to be here anymore .
is that legitimate enough ?
what is going on with you ?
i don &apos;t need to sit in a room
and read books about made @-@ up people who &apos;ve been screwed over .
okay , i get it .
it &apos;s not gonna prepare me for what i have to deal with
when i walk out of this building .
it is a complete waste of my time !
enjoying a nice day in the park ?
oh . spencer . i didn &apos;t even see you , uh ...
been writing down all of your thoughts and feelings ?
um ... actually , i was working on this , um ...
how could you do that to her ?
i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i @-@ i--
no , don &apos;t apologize to me .
my god , not after the way that you &apos;ve treated her .
do you even get how much she loves you ?
do you think that it &apos;s easy to find out a secret like that ?
because it &apos;s not , okay ? it &apos;s a burden .
i mean , you &apos;re screwed
if you tell and you &apos;re screwed if you don &apos;t ,
and if you really want to get pissed and take it out on somebody ,
don &apos;t dump it on aria , okay ?
no , go after maggie , because she &apos;s actually
the person who had your son
and then kept it a secret for seven years !
what are you talking about ?
i thought ... i thought , um ...
i thought that aria had told you , and ...
did you not have this conversation ?
what ... conversation ?
what-- what are you talking about ?
i need to ... i need to go .
no , spencer , wait .
oh . thank you .
no problem .
how &apos;s the family ?
mm , everyone &apos;s good , you know ?
my husband &apos;s back in texas on base , in training ,
and emily &apos;s ...
you know , she &apos;s okay .
good .
hey , can i ask you something ?
emily got a package yesterday
from the family of the kid who killed maya st . germain .
should i be worried that they have our address ?
they shouldn &apos;t be contacting you at all .
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt .
no , please . this kind of thing &apos;s much more his territory than mine .
if you want , we can ask that his family
send any future correspondence directly to us ,
let us run interference .
thanks . i &apos;ll think about that .
hey , you seen spencer ?
mmm , no , not since this morning .
everyone said she bailed on her study group .
she just walked out of class .
hey , what are you doing here ?
could i see you for a moment ?
sure , what &apos;s going on . is everything okay ?
okay ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
why was spencer talking about maggie ?
what ?
she said that i had ...
that i have a son .
why would she say that ?
look , can we just talk about this--
we &apos;re talking about this right now .
ezra , please .
y @-@ you &apos;ve been holding onto this since my birthday ?
ezra--
so , what , you and my brother ...
just sat there watching me blow out candles ,
and you couldn &apos;t find a way to tell me this ?
i was scared .
of ?
of what it might do to us .
and then maggie showed up ,
and i thought that she
was going to tell you , and when she didn &apos;t--
maggie hasn &apos;t been a part of my life since high school .
i see you every day , aria . you .
you are the person i &apos;m spending my life with .
you are the person i &apos;m supposed to trust .
you &apos;re right .
所以替你发了一条短信 -a
you know , the only thing worse than the break room coffee
are the break room bagels .
how &apos;s emily feel about you working here ?
how should she feel ?
i was hoping it would make her feel a little safer .
you know , when i was growing up here ,
they could have put up a sign :
&quot; welcome to rosewood , where nothing happens . &quot;
but in these past few years ...
detective wilden , if you &apos;re asking if we &apos;re considering moving--
i wouldn &apos;t blame you .
there are days when i wish i could leave too .
but no matter how far i went ,
i &apos;d still be taking so many questions with me .
you know , you may not believe this ,
but i know exactly what emily &apos;s going through .
i &apos;m not following you .
what happened out at that lighthouse ,
it &apos;s not really something any young person can process .
even when it &apos;s self @-@ defense .
but uh ...
it haunts you . forever .
i can &apos;t really get her to talk about it much .
well , i didn &apos;t either .
talk about it .
my second week out of the academy ,
i had to defend myself .
the way they taught me .
but that doesn &apos;t make watching someone die any easier .
i was too ashamed to discuss it .
in the law &apos;s eyes , i was clearly in the right .
but having to watch someone leave this world ,
even someone who deserves to be punished ...
so when did you finally decide to start talking about it ?
just now .
tried calling you .
sorry , i shut my phone off .
yeah , well , you didn &apos;t come back today to school .
my mom said she might call your parents .
i figured .
i don &apos;t think she wants to . i just think--
whatever . it &apos;s okay . i won &apos;t hold it against her .
anyway , it &apos;s not really why you came .
no .
i wanted to talk to you ...
i know that i shouldn &apos;t have said anything to fitz .
okay , i know that .
so , can we please just skip ahead to the end ?
sorry ?
could we just fast @-@ forward to the part
where you scream or you cry
or just do whatever you need to do , okay ?
wait , i @-@ i didn &apos;t come here to punish you , spencer .
i know that you were set up .
&quot; a &quot; sent me a text to rub it in my face right after ezra left .
i think that we should stop blaming &quot; a &quot;
for everything that goes wrong in our lives ,
and start blaming ourselves .
are you actually defending our enemy right now ?
no , i &apos;m just saying that maybe if we stopped telling lies ,
maybe &quot; a &quot; wouldn &apos;t have a reason to keep on exposing them .
&quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t some tough @-@ love life coach , spencer .
we &apos;re not being taught
to mind our manners and eat our vegetables .
this person wants to hurt us .
maybe we deserve it .
unbelievable .
and thanks for your concern , by the way .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m doing just fine .
wow . this is crazy .
i totally remember this .
we were stuck in the car with ali &apos;s parents ,
two hours from shore , and our phones were dead .
it was brutal .
so ... who was the &quot; beach hottie &quot; ?
mm , i have no idea .
but you were writing about him .
i just knew him by that name .
ali never told me who he was .
so you never even met him ?
well , i mean , i probably did .
honestly , there were so many hotties down there that summer .
but ali was being really sketchy about it .
ijust assumed he was seeing her on the side .
he probably had a girlfriend or something .
would jason know this person ?
if he did , he would have made him sorry
he ever looked at his little sister .
why ?
will somebody call jason and tell him to leave his weed
and come meet up with us .
what are you doing here ?
i needed to talk to you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think i &apos;m in trouble .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m late .
like ... ?
yeah .
you mean you weren &apos;t using protection ?
we were . just not all the time .
okay , how late are you ?
two weeks .
have you ever been late before ?
what am i gonna do ?
have you told him ?
i can &apos;t .
if he finds out , he &apos;s gonna kill me .
ali was ...
listen , i &apos;m not a doctor ,
but ... she thought that she was .
it &apos;s like i said--
it was an intense couple of weeks .
hey . what are you doing ?
right now ? following paige .
what ?
she &apos;s the one who &apos;s been working with caleb to bring down mona .
i &apos;m trying to bust them before &quot; a &quot; does .
wait , when did you find this out ?
before lunch .
i was gonna tell you , but ezra ...
right .
hanna , be careful .
i @-@ i gotta go . i &apos;ll call you later .
bye .
bye .
what is this ?
raspberry flirtini .
thank you , but i didn &apos;t order this .
i know . she ordered it for you .
you &apos;ve been on that couch a while .
how &apos; bout i make my fancy grilled cheese ?
yeah .
if she were pregnant ,
wouldn &apos;t that kind of thing show up on her ...
autopsy ?
not necessarily .
i looked online , and ...
if it was really early on ,
she was buried over a year ago , so ...
what shall we do now ?
i don &apos;t know .
but look , if some guy in cape may did get her pregnant
and then threatened to kill her if he found out ,
this is a lot bigger than a key .
this needs to be turned over to the police .
i was worried you were gonna say that .
but i agree .
i &apos;ll take you down to the station .
then i &apos;m coming with you .
no , that &apos;s okay . i won &apos;t be alone .
my mom will be there .
i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
i miss you .
and if they play the uncut version of this ,
then i &apos;d have to kiss you .
hey , ladies , shots are a dollar .
if you holler in the next half hour ,
so step up and get &apos; em while they &apos;re hot , hot , hot !
hi . i hope you don &apos;t mind . i just really love this song .
who is this peroxide piece of trash ?
hey , watch it !
can i see your i.d. ?
why would the police want this ?
i don &apos;t know . um , ali wrote in it .
maybe there &apos;s something in there
that could help them figure out who would want to hurt her .
okay , let me find out who to give this to .
hanna ?
hi . what are you doing here ?
what &apos;s that smell ? is that ... tequila ?
no . it &apos;s actually gin .
a little bit got in my mouth
when , uh , the girl threw it in my face , so ...
who did ? what happened ?
nothing . i just ...
i got busted for underage drinking ,
which i wasn &apos;t even doing .
unfortunately , &quot; i &apos;m just holding it &quot;
doesn &apos;t work on betty the bouncer .
you were at a club .
more of a bar .
what bar ?
oh , it was more of a club .
you wouldn &apos;t have heard of it .
my mom &apos;s gonna kill me .
hey , emily . hanna .
i just spoke with your mom .
she said you wanted to turn something in ?
what are you doing ?
the cops need to see that .
unfortunately , he &apos;s one of &apos; em .
i appreciate you bringing this down .
we &apos;ll return it to you as soon as we can .
oh , and emily ,
you did the right thing .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking we could end this .
i &apos;m gonna get a coffee . do you want one ?
no thanks .
i &apos;ll take a napkin , for blotting .
what &apos;s wrong ?
look who else was in cape may .
i didn &apos;t know if you were really gonna show .
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
said you were 18 , right ?
so ...
how does this work ?
well ...
this works ...
whichever way you want it to work .
you called me .
i &apos;m sensing some hesitation here .
what does this go to ?
that &apos;s what i would like you to find out .
and if you follow him ...
he &apos;ll lead you there .
wait .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
hold it .
can i at least shower first ?
my hair is about to crack off my head .
i &apos;m not going to bed without discussing this .
what were you doing in that bar ?
mom .
was it about ... exploring a new feeling ?
okay , i wasn &apos;t looking for romance . i was looking for caleb .
what would caleb be doing hanging out in a lesbian bar ?
i didn &apos;t know it was ladies &apos; night until i got there .
look , i was following paige
because i thought he was meeting up with her .
for what ?
a plan to keep mona away from my friends .
he and paige don &apos;t want her near us ,
so i was just gonna stop them from doing anything stupid .
and that required ordering a cocktail and starting a bar fight ?
i did not order a cocktail ,
and i only danced with
that girl who thought i was into pink drinks
because i didn &apos;t want paige to see me .
what &apos;s a pink drink ?
is that code for something gay ?
no , it &apos;s just a pink drink .
can we not do this right now ?
hanna , we &apos;re getting to that place again .
what place ?
where i &apos;m sensing you &apos;re not telling me the whole truth .
well , i &apos;m not hiding anything from you , okay ?
i was just making sure caleb didn &apos;t get into trouble .
and you got yourself into trouble instead .
well , that wasn &apos;t the plan .
and , honestly , if it keeps emily from being messed with ,
maybe it was worth it .
what does emily have to do with this ?
paige might not be a one @-@ girl kind of girl .
she was hooking up with someone there , and emily has no clue .
could i make a suggestion ?
stay out of it .
and use the hot oil treatment on your hair .
hey .
i was just ...
i thought that we were meeting up at your apartment .
no , we are . uh ...
i was just putting a few things in the car .
can i just explain to you why--
i don &apos;t need you to explain .
i spoke with maggie , and she told me
that she asked you to keep quiet .
and ... she knows it was an unfair position to put you in .
so are we okay ?
yeah .
are you okay ?
i don &apos;t even know how to begin
to answer that question .
yeah . i understand .
good .
because i don &apos;t .
there are , like , a million thoughts
fighting in my head right now , and ...
i &apos;m about to meet my son .
but you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah , tonight .
how long ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
well , where are you staying tonight ?
motel .
i got a college buddy in the area
that i can stay with tomorrow night .
that &apos;s good .
yep .
can i call you ?
ezra ?
ezra ?
we &apos;ll talk soon , okay ?
