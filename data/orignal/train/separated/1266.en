Come on, Maura. You can do it.
No, I can't. I feel like crap.
Okay, come on.
I told ma that we'd meet her
at the bunker hill parade, okay?
she has T.J.
It's historically incorrect.
The battle of bunker hill was fought on breed's hill.
Okay.
We will tell them that when we get there, okay?
Come on. The doctor cleared you to work out weeks ago.
No, Maura.
Maura, Maura, Maura.
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on.
Ow, ow, ow!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm sorry.
All right. We'll take it slow. Okay.
I still think it's amazing
they can suck out an organ through a straw.
It's called a laparoscope,
And they do not use it to "Suck out" your kidney.
"Minimally invasive," My ass.
You're gonna feel much better
when you get back in shape, okay?
Come on.
Are you saying that I'm fat and out of shape?
No.
I am saying that you have got to stop hoping
that they're gonna send you
some "Thank you for your kidney" Fruit basket.
Giving the gift of life
is the only reward that I need, okay?
I'm very happy with my decision.
Then why are you still such a whiny pain in the ass?
Did you just call me a whiny pain in the ass?
No.
Maura.
Ever since you gave
that ungrateful half-sister of yours your kidney,
You just -- you just haven't been yourself.
Okay?
And I'm not the only one that sees it.
Just -- - you've been talking about me?
My best friend gossiping after what I've been through?
Ooh, it's cold!
I'm gonna run.
Wait. Did sergeant Korsak say something?
Or was it angela?
Is she complaining?
You know, after I bought her da hong pao tea.
Hey, T.J., you like the parade?
You like the music?
What the heck is that?
Nice, right? I just bought it.
Want to go for a ride?
No. Motorcycles are dangerous.
Only if I drop it on my foot.
I can't get it started.
Good.
Hey, ma.
Hi.
Frankie, did you get it?
Did you get it?!
It's not official.
Angela, if you have an issue with my mood --
Your mood?
Well, Jane said that you were complaining about me.
I did not say that, ma.
Look, sweetheart, we're worried about you.
Wouldn't you be happier
if you just talked to your mom and sister?
Dr. Phil, can this wait, all right?
Frankie has an announcement.
I'm getting promoted to detective.
Yes!
In the drug unit.
That's why I bought this.
It's my cover.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
That's great.
Great job.
Well, at least you get to go undercover as a biker
instead of a prostitute.
It wasn't my idea.
Did it cut out suddenly?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Electrical.
Unless -- what kind of a sound did it make?
Was it a cough or a wheeze?
Like a
But did it also sputter?
Like a ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka?
No, it was more like kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh.
Hi! Hello!
Can you two please get a room
preferably a soundproof one?
Carburetor.
If you get it over to my house, I'll help you fix it.
That'd be great. Thanks.
Well, unless you have a problem with my mood, too.
Maura, let it go.
Oh, look, there's senator Malcolm Humphrey.
Well, ex-senator. I worked on his campaign.
Oh, look, and right behind
is his beautiful daughter, erica.
Such a great story.
She won his seat.
It must be nice
to follow in your father's footsteps.
What? No.
I'd be a plumber, and you'd be a mob boss.
Well, okay, all I'm trying to say is,
It would be lovely to have
A father/daughter relationship that works.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It's not your fault pop's a jerk.
Gun!
Ma, get T.J. out of here.
Oh, my god! Senator!
Get E.M.S. Here! Get all these people out of here now!
Frankie! This way.
Give me the gun.
No. Move.
Clear.
Clear.
A decent deer hunter could have made that shot.
It's no more than 70 yards.
Should we try to find him?
We don't know who we're looking for.
But I don't think we're looking for a professional.
What makes you say that?
He puked after he shot her.
I wonder what that blue stuff is.
Get csru in here and have them collect it.
Get dna from vomit?
Not usually.
process it anyway.
Erica.
Dad!
Let me through! Let me through!
Jennifer! That's my sister!
Let her through!
Oh, dad!
I heard screaming!
Oh, my god!
Do you want someone to take your baby?
It's Erica's baby.
It's okay, Liam. It's okay, baby.
Jennifer, she's gone.
Erica's gone.
Oh, my god!
Get the bullet out yet?
What are you doing?
Biting on a pencil.
Yes, I can see that. But why?
It activates the muscles used for smiling.
Well, those muscles are a little out of shape.
I'm going to ignore you and attempt to improve my mood.
Okay.
So... Biting pencils works?
Well, holding your teeth in this position
engages the zygomaticus major and the risorius muscle.
I can't understand you.
Some studies show that you can trick your brain
into thinking you're happy by moving certain muscles.
It's petty. Small-minded.
Should be enough to know that I saved someone's life.
Maura, if Mother Teresa gave her kidney
to a half-sister she barely knew,
even she would expect a call from her mother saying,
I don't know, "Thanks for the organ."
I told Hope not to contact me,
and I never want Cailin to know I'm her donor.
Great way to spend a Sunday.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
News crews outside?
It's a gang bang out there.
Sawing-type wound with jagged edges.
Two punctures.
It was approximately 2.9 centimeters.
Maura, I'm pretty confident
she didn't die from tetanus.
No, she did not, and you know how I know that?
Because you were there when she was shot?
'Cause this wound looks about five days old.
You think that's from barbed wire?
Looks like that to me.
Okay, Maura, um... I don't want to rush you
or tell you how to do your job,
but maybe you could dig out the bullet first
so we could get started on ballistics?
I think there might be something trapped in the wound.
Well, there's definitely a bullet trapped in the skull.
It'd be good to look at that bullet.
It sure would.
Excuse me a minute.
Oh, boy.
You think the old Maura's ever coming back?
Man, I hope so.
Husband wasn't at the parade.
What do we know about him?
He's a former environmental lawyer, like Erica was.
They were married for 10 years.
Two kids.
A six-year-old and the toddler
we saw with the sister at the parade.
The sister was her chief of staff.
Maybe a radical political organization,
an opponent, a whack job.
It seems to me there's a lot easier ways
to kill a state senator.
No, I was thinking the same thing.
Small staff, no bodyguards.
What did she make, like 60k a year?
$61,132.99.
Okay, I came upstairs to tell you
that the bullet fragmented when it hit the skull.
How big are the pieces?
Basically shavings.
Damn. We'll have a hell of a time tracing that.
Susie's running the body through X-Ray
to make sure I didn't miss any pieces.
That's not cool.
Okay, that's mean.
Society is slow to change, even though 53% of women
are the main breadwinners in their households.
How come I don't have one of those chicks in my household?
Jane, um...
Can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure. I'll call you later.
Or...Uh...
Maura, have you seen the new break room?
It's the old break room.
They just took all the old stuff --
Thanks for taking the bullet out.
You have your own refrigerator. Impressive.
Okay, what did you want to talk to me about?
Could you ever be married to a caretaker?
And this is a pressing question because...
Oh, I was just thinking about you and Casey.
Well, stop.
I haven't heard from that guy in three months.
Plus, I don't really think he's the househusband type.
Probably just fell in love with his nurse
or physical therapist.
Very common.
I know what you're doing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Misery loves company.
Maura.
I hate seeing you so sad,
and whatever you're feeling,
it's okay to feel it, all right?
Just say it.
Okay.
I did want a fruit basket.
Yes.
I did, and it should have had D'Anjou pears
And -- and -- and a nice Prosecco
And Gourmet Chocolates and spa stuff.
So pick up the phone and tell her.
I can't.
Maura, okay, look.
It is okay for you to want a relationship with your mom.
You'd be even weirder than you are
if you didn't want to know your biological mother.
Okay, so, now I am a whiny, weird pain in the ass.
I'm trying to be patient.
That must be very hard for you.
It is!
Well, I'd at least like to know
if Cailin is taking care of my kidney.
Well, so, what? You want to spy on your kidney?
There you are.
This is nice.
What is it, Susie?
I thought you'd like to know that I was analyzing
the stomach contents from the victim,
and I noticed blueberries in it.
Blueberries?
I found blue chunks in vomit at the scene.
Yeah, I know that.
I was analyzing that, too.
Did you compare both the samples?
Yes.
So, Erica and her killer
both had the same batch of blueberry waffles
two hours before Erica was shot.
Wow, that is a huge break
if we can figure out who she ate breakfast with.
I say it's the husband.
He's got motive.
Which is?
He's fed up with being a househusband.
He was a big lawyer when they met.
She worked for him.
Well, we could rule out her staffers,
and her opponent's right there.
Thank you so much.
I love Massachusetts, and I love your big hearts.
And we're live
as slain senator Erica Humphrey-Miller's husband, Jeff Miller,
enters the State House just hours after the shooting.
First thing he does is go to his wife's office?
He killed her to take her seat?
Let's go talk to him.
Take Frost.
I want to go look at the bullet fragments.
Governor just called.
And you know how much I hate it when the governor calls.
Not only was our victim a state senator,
her father has friends in high places,
so let's get this shooter as fast as we can.
Yes, sir.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Okay.
I heard your mother was at the parade with T.J.
How's she doing?
Why don't you call her?
I mean, I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
Well, I don't want to bother her.
She just watched a woman get gunned down.
She's already pretty bothered.
Well, tell her -- give her my best.
No matter what, my wife's work will continue.
She was committed to all of you
and to the people of Massachusetts.
Yeah, sounds like he's running for office.
Mm-hmm.
You were there.
Yes.
I'm detective Jane Rizzoli.
This is detective Bbarry Frost.
We're very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
I'll do whatever I can
to find the people who murdered my wife.
Did she have any enemies?
Anyone she was afraid of?
Erica was pushing to pass new environmental legislation.
The bad guys didn't like that.
You think that got her killed?
Yes.
I think it was a fringe group.
She'd always gotten nasty letters, but...
this felt organized.
Did you call the police?
She didn't want to.
Did she have a breakfast meeting scheduled for this morning?
No.
You sure? She left the house at 7:00.
Well, she didn't get to the parade until 8:30.
Where was she for 90 minutes?
No idea.
I handled her schedule.
All she had today was the parade.
What does "THT" Stand for?
It's right here on Tuesday, June 11th.
I don't know.
Her calendar was packed last week.
It's wide open this coming week.
"Deliver GBS tomorrow." What does that mean?
I don't know.
Erica put it in the calendar.
Why weren't you at the parade?
One of us had to take our six-year-old
to his soccer game.
Our children were very important to us.
We didn't want them to have the childhood Erica had.
We were campaign kids.
We spent every spare minute with my dad.
We got to do sports, though.
She was a great skier.
Um...I'm sorry.
We're gonna need to collect her computer.
It's in her office.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Miller.
Uh, where was your son's soccer game?
Breed's Park.
That's not far from the parade.
What's that supposed to mean?
I didn't shoot my wife.
We found some evidence at the scene.
Well, check with the other parents.
They'll confirm my alibi.
I intend to,
and I'm sorry to ask, but I'd like to do a cheek swab.
I'm also an attorney, detective.
You need to show some probable cause,
and since you don't have any,
I'm going home to my motherless children.
I really hope he didn't kill her.
What'd you find?
I got her computer.
Uh, what do you make of this?
I found four of these under the senator's desk.
Dirty water?
Her sister doesn't know why she was keeping them.
I don't know.
We'll take it to the lab and have them analyzed.
It's Maura, and she's out front.
I have no idea why.
I got this. I'll meet you back at the ranch.
Okay, thanks.
Do you see her?
No.
Her Facebook page said she'd be here.
Is that her?
Is that a triple shot with three pumps of caramel?
Well, it's better than three shots of tequila.
That is not a very respectful way
to treat someone else's kidney.
Oh, god! Get down!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Slouch!
Oh, did she see us? Did she see us?
I don't know, Maura. The window's over there.
What are you doing?
I'm reading an e-mail from Susie.
Really?
Wait. I can listen to it.
Her Facebook page
says Cailin has checked in at the college cafe.
Well, thanks for the tip.
This is awkward.
Well, you are spying on her.
I am spying on my kidney.
That is very different.
Okay.
Go talk to her.
No.
Go!
And please hurry.
We have a lot of work to do.
I feel very silly.
You're gonna feel even sillier
when I push you out with my feet.
Cailin?
Cailin, wait. Let me -- let me explain.
No. You don't have to.
I've owed you an apology for a long time.
I'm really sorry about everything that I said
and all the crap that I pulled.
I really appreciate you saying that.
I can't ever really thank you enough.
For what?
Come on, Maura.
I'm premed.
I knew it was your kidney,
but you confirmed it when you got out of the car.
Does it still hurt?
Not too bad.
Thank you for checking up on me.
That is what you were doing, right?
I was gonna send this.
It belongs to you.
To me?
You'll understand once you open it.
I wrote you a letter, too.
I should probably get to class,
but would it be all right if I maybe...were to text you sometime?
Text me. Um...
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Okay. Cool.
All right. Um...Bye.
Bye.
So...
She gave me this.
Wow. Scrimshaw.
It's really pretty.
I think that's real whalebone.
It's a family heirloom.
Hope gave it to Cailin on her 18th birthday.
Well, that was sweet of her to give it to you.
Or not.
It was a gift to Hope on her 18th birthday.
Who gave it to her?
A man who's about to go on trial for 15 murders.
My father, Paddy Doyle.
Okay, so, this website, "Stop Bad People,"
looks like the same organization that sent this to Erica's office.
Yeah, I'm trying to get a physical address
tied to their I.P. address,
But whoever built this website is good.
I checked Erica's credit cards.
She didn't use them today.
The only calls she made were to her husband and her sister.
What about the bullet fragments?
No, it's a dead end.
No way we'll get enough ballistics to even run it.
But based on weight, it's a .22.
Well, that's something.
Yeah!
I am the man.
"Stop Bad People" has a Boston address.
437 Claremont Street.
Check this out.
They're anti-women, anti-environment, anti-AAA?
Who's anti-AAA?
Oh, well, look at this.
Whoever administers that hate site is a registered gun owner.
Hey, King of the World, if you're not too busy.
Any DNA yet?
No. I'm sorry, Detective.
Damn. Have you seen dr. Isles?
A gravity inverter.
And we're inverting because...
I'd rather not say.
Okay.
But if you think it's because of that necklace --
What, this?
Why would a necklace that your mob-boss father
gave your pregnant teenage mom upset you so much
that you're hanging upside down like a bat?
Well, inverting equalizes cerebral fluid
and eases the strain on the vertebrae.
You're worried about Paddy's trial, aren't you?
I was so wrapped up in recovering from surgery
that I didn't have time to think about him, too.
It's very overwhelming.
What do I do?
I think you know what you should do.
Reach out to Hope.
I'm sure she's dying to talk to you.
No.
I'm fine.
Not with this in your mouth.
Come on. Come on.
We have a murder to solve.
And I need your help.
Take him on down to the interrogation room, Tony.
W-- is that the "Stop Bad People" guy?
Come on.
You'll get a kick out of this guy.
You're a detective?
Yeah.
Hey, Ismail, stop drooling over Detective Rizzoli
and talk to me about this gun.
You pulled the guts out.
Yeah, the -- the plastic ones that come with the game suck.
He used this for video games?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
A-are you a fan?
Do you -- do you like -- do you play video games?
Oh, yeah.
How about if you tell us a little bit about your operation?
Um, I-I don't know what you're --
What -- what you're...talk-- talk-- talking about.
Cyber bullying is a federal crime, Ismail.
A federal crime.
Okay, the service I provide isn't bullying.
It's legal harassment.
Okay.
You want to tell us why you were legally harassing
Senator Erica Humphrey-Miller?
What?
Oh, that -- that -- you don't --
I didn't have any personal animosity towards her
or any of the people my customers hire me to harass.
So that's your business?
You build hate websites and send hate mail?
Well, I -- I wouldn't describe it quite like that.
Who hired you to harass the Senator?
I don't know.
I swear. I don't.
It's part of my business model.
I use a pay service that assures anonymity for all my clients.
We've seized all his computers.
Okay. Let's go see if you are telling the truth.
Why -- why would I lie?
I'm a businessman, not an assassin.
It was -- it was --
It was really nice to meet you, Detective.
We should do something sometime or --
Hey, should I -- should I wait here?
Yes, why don't you?
He's telling the truth about the pay service.
It's a pretty complex money transaction.
I'm not sure I can track where the funds come from.
I'll tell them to let him go.
Hey, release that kid, Ismail. Thanks.
So, all we know is someone orchestrated a nasty campaign
against the victim.
I'm telling you, the husband had time.
Soccer parents only remember seeing him
at the beginning and the end of the game.
That's not enough to arrest him.
We need something that shows they had breakfast together.
Yeah, the blueberry waffles are the key here.
If she really left her house at 7:00,
she had 90 minutes
before she was first seen at the parade.
So, where'd she go?
Well, she couldn't have driven
more than, say, 20 miles each way.
So...
we look...
20 miles in every direction.
That's a lot of area to cover.
1,256.6 square miles.
Area...
equals pi "R" squared.
Get Frankie in here.
Have him check every fast-food place
and restaurant that serves breakfast.
I thought he got promoted.
Not yet.
Glad you're not my sister.
Do you want to do it?
No.
DNA?
No. Results on the water
from the bottles you found under the victim's desk.
It's well water mixed with soil.
That's it? There's no contaminates?
Nope.
Erica's hard drive had the results
of groundwater and soil studies
she'd had commissioned over the last six months.
Why in Readville?
I don't know. But everything was normal.
Didn't seem worth mentioning.
Is there any way to see if
the water in those bottles came from Readville, too?
I'll have the crime lab look into it.
What'll that tell us?
I don't know. Just following a hunch.
What? You're not tired?
I'm fine. I'm just sick of you yawning.
I've got to call it a night.
My dog walker called in sick.
And what's your excuse?
Slave driver didn't show up to race the dog team?
Cats having a fashion show?
Hamsters made you dinner?
Yeah. All of the above.
Good night.
Hey, Jane, let's run.
It's not too far to your apartment.
Now you want to run?
Come on. I finally feel like it.
The things I do for you.
Who is that?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
I don't know what I did with my pepper spray.
I knew I should have brought my gun.
Oh, my god. It's Casey.
Looks realy good. I hope all of his parts are working.
Oh, Maura.
Hey, there.
Hi.
I called the station.
They, uh, they said you were on your way home.
What are you doing here?
You look great.
Well, I feel pretty good.
Wow, I mean, you've recovered most of your mobility.
Are you wearing thermoplastic braces?
You've got good eyes.
Yeah.
I mean, how is that possible?
You had cauda equina.
It isn't treatable.
Well, I'm still trying to believe it myself.
I got lucky.
I was, uh, I was misdiagnosed thanks to a bad MRI..
But you still had neurosurgery.
Oh, yeah.
They opened me up,
and they found shrapnel pressing against my spinal cord.
Took it out.
That's incredible.
It really is.
And what about sexual function?
Dr. Isles, this is actually not one of your patients.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go finish my run. I'll see you tomorrow.
No, Maura, come on. I'll take you home. It's...
So happy this isn't awkward.
I have to walk Jo Friday.
I mean, do you want to --
Yeah. I'd really like that.
Okay.
I never know how long
you're supposed to let a dog sniff.
You're not. She's marking territory.
Look sharp!
Cesar, the dog whisperer.
He uses that expression.
It's from the north of England.
It means be quick and do your business.
She only did that because you're a soldier
and you have a hint of an accent.
I don't have an accent.
Yes, you do.
It was worse when we were in high school,
But I can still hear
the north of England in you.
That's something I love about you --
that you've known me for so long.
My massive crush began on you when I was 15.
I wrote about 100 e-mails to you in the hospital,
More when I was recovering.
I never got them.
I didn't send any of them.
It wasn't just the physical injuries that stopped me.
It was, uh...
It was PTSD.
I know a little about post-traumatic stress disorder.
Someday, if -- if you want to hear it,
I'll tell you what happened.
Right now, I'm just so happy to see you.
I see the neurosurgeon fixed that, too.
He did.
God, you're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
I'm thinking something, Jane.
What? No, no, no. No thinking. No thinking.
Yeah.
I'm thinking that...
I want us to be in love before we do this.
I can't just show up --
Ugh. God, you're good.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, you just said the best line
to get a woman to take her clothes off.
I did?
Yes.
You know you did.
Casey?
You don't leave a chef an awful lot to work with.
Jar of pickles and marmite that expired five years ago.
Put that back.
Maura gave that to me.
I might use it to kill her someday.
Good morning.
Morning.
Somebody needs to take care of you.
I should have told you this last night.
No, if this is about your STDs or your ex-wives or --
Just please save it for after breakfast.
I'm going back to Afghanistan.
Just for a few months.
I've been asked to go with a team of psychologists.
I'm getting training in virtual therapy for combat soldiers.
Is that what helped you? Virtual therapy?
Then I understand.
I knew you would.
When I get back,
I think it's time you and I give it a shot.
Me too.
Go all domestic together.
Yes, but there has to be rules
before you throw out my marmite.
I'll get you another jar,
And I'll also teach you to get jo Friday to look sharp.
Maybe.
Only if you keep the accent.
I...don't have an accent.
Yes, you do.
You do have an accent.
Hello?
Help.
You're supposed to set it for your height.
I was thinking about the case.
I think you were thinking about the case-y.
Well, I came to see you,
but someone was taking their sweet time
in coming to work.
Well, that's 'cause you wouldn't stop talking
when I was trying to get dressed.
You called me.
He'll be back, Jane.
You said he'd be at the Bagram air base.
Yeah, but he still has to go to Kandahar.
By plane.
He said no road travel.
You know, when he told me, I was so sad and terrified.
But I was also...
Oh, my god. It can't be.
What? Tell me.
I was relieved.
Is that all?
What do you mean, is that all?
You've been pining over this man for a year now.
It's simply fear talking.
You're afraid that if you allow yourself to get involved,
you'll get hurt,
so you're looking for reasons to withdraw.
I am not.
He moved the cereal boxes.
And he threw out my shredded wheat.
You've had that box for five years.
I just opened it.
I mean, what if this is the gateway
to mom Jeans and baby slime
and -- and arguments over the remote control
and clipping coupons and buying in bulk?
Okay, go back to telling me about the part
when he had you pinned against the building.
Oh, yeah.
Some of the results are in
on the particulate found in Erica's scratch.
Disturbed soil.
Disturbed soil?
That just means it's from an old industrial area.
Looks like Readville.
Readville.
Again.
And again.
The second round of water results are back, too,
and the water in the bottles from Erica's office
was also from Readville.
Hey. What do you got?
I cannot wait until 5:00 on Friday,
when my promotion becomes official
and I don't have to be your personal patrol-officer slave.
Just tell me if you found a diner
that serves blueberry waffles in Readville, please.
Why didn't you tell me it was in Readville?
Do you know how many places I called?
394, Jane.
I didn't know we were looking in Readville, Frankie.
That's what you do when you're a detective.
You detect.
All right.
Thank you.
Hey, Maura.
Morning, Frankie.
Jane, the yellow pollen in her scratch
is from the lonicera hirsuta,
also called the hairy honeysuckle flower.
Does the horny honeysuckle grow in Readville?
Hairy.
No. It only grows in the Berkshires.
Then you can tell me about the hairy horny flower later.
Let's go get blueberry waffles.
Oh, I already ate.
No -- I did, too, but you're coming with me.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
I might need you to take some water samples, okay?
Come on. The key to this is Readville.
Good morning.
Hi. Do you have blueberry waffles?
Oh, we just ran out.
But the corned beef hash is really good.
Maura.
That's our victim.
What are we gonna do now?
Senator Erica was the only one who'd listen.
See that little boy?
He's so sick now he can barely hold up his head.
Cancer.
And that little girl and that one, too.
Something is poisoning us all here.
I'm sorry.
Let me get you two a table.
Thank you.
Okay, that's why Erica was doing soil and water testing
here in Readville.
Nonspecific symptoms and unrelated illnesses
don't necessarily mean
that environmental toxins are getting in the water supply.
You know, don't ever eat in hospital cafeterias.
Oh, and avoid anybody in scrubs.
Anything else?
Why do you have to be like that?
Like what?
Like every time you have a random thought,
I got to get into your random-thought caravan.
Well, hospital uniforms are teeming with bacteria.
I'm giving you a tip to be healthy.
Maura, that's it.
What's it?
Oh, now I'm supposed to get in your caravan.
They're factory workers.
Look at the logos -- that horny flower.
Hairy.
What makes it distinctive is the fuzzy leaves.
Wait. Let me see your tablet.
Hairy honeysuckle battery company.
You said this only grows in the Berkshires.
It does. It's endangered.
Looks like they transplanted it.
The vines are growing on the barbed wire.
You found that same pollen in soil in Erica's scratch.
She must have snuck in the factory.
What was she looking for?
Well, they recycle lead-acid, nickel cadmium,
nickel metal hydride batteries.
How toxic is all that?
Newer batteries are reasonably clean,
but older batteries, they release lead and cadmium.
Could the workers carry that out on their uniforms?
Yes, it's known as take-home toxins.
THT's -- take-home toxins.
Erica had written that down in her calendar.
These men are probably covered in toxins.
And Erica figured that out, and whoever killed her
didn't want her making that public.
Bill Davenport owns the factory.
Problem is, he was in San Francisco yesterday.
So, unless he hired someone, he's not our shooter.
Look at this, Jane.
Erica Humphrey-Miller wrote up a grant proposal.
To the Department of Energy? Why?
It looks like the grant money was supposed to fund
environmentally friendly practices.
Hairy Honeysuckle got 2 million bucks.
Why am I paying taxes?
So they can give them to Bill Davenport?
Does he look like he needs the money?
Well, it's used to pay for safeguards
like showers and air regulators,
in addition to disposable uniforms.
Which they weren't using.
What if they took the government handout
and then paid off an inspector to look the other way?
Osha doesn't monitor take-home toxins
with inspectors yet.
They rely on outside regulators.
Frost, scroll to the end of that document.
Look who was in charge of compliance.
You said you didn't know what THT meant.
Then I'll decode that for you.
It means "take-home toxins."
Where are we going with this?
You said you had a development in the case.
We do.
These are straps for a .22 caliber rifle,
aren't they, Jennifer?
Erica and Jennifer were both biathletes.
What does this have to do with my daughter's murder?
Senator, you need to hear this.
Your resume on the senate website
says you went to law school.
Doesn't say you failed the bar three times.
No husband, no children.
Erica threw you a bone making you chief of staff.
Detective Frost, please tell us what you found.
The person who paid "Stop Bad People"
to harass Erica used a pay service
that hides their customers' identities
by sending the money through a Boston bank,
a Nashville bank, and, finally, a bank in London.
Those documents there trace a transaction
right back to your office computer.
What?
What the hell is going on here?
I think Jennifer knows.
That's pretty cold, Jennifer.
We found gun oil inside the baby's backpack...
and what's left of a blueberry waffle.
Three months ago, Erica started testing
the water and the soil in Readville
because the children were so sick,
but the water was fine, the soil was fine,
so it didn't make any sense...
Unless the toxins were coming
from the only new thing in town --
the Honeysuckle battery factory.
Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not possible.
Erica got them a $2 million grant to prevent that.
I bet it was hard for Erica to believe
that her little sister would take a bribe
and let children die.
"Deliver gbs."
Tell your father, Jennifer.
What did that mean?
It meant...
deliver goodbye speech.
Oh, my god.
Erica was gonna resign and expose you,
and I'll bet she was even gonna take the responsibility
and clean up the environmental mess that you made.
I want a lawyer.
I bet you do.
I'm sorry, Senator.
At least her children won't be orphans.
Even more reason to marry a househusband.
I'm glad I don't have a sister.
Well, Cailin's not gonna shoot me.
You know, that motorcycle would make a beautiful cafe racer.
Come on.
He's in the drug unit, not the espresso unit.
The Harley look is passe.
1960s British rockers are back.
Actually, cafe racer could be a better cover
for busting dealers selling in clubs and colleges.
I'm in.
Can you get it running?
Well, the intake vacuum pressure pulls the fuel through
and mixes liquid with air
before it sucks it into the combustion chamber.
Mm. Go on.
Violent explosion rams the big piston down
with great force.
Long connecting rod forces the crank pin into rotation,
which is what you want.
God, I would love to have my crank pin rotated
right about now.
I knew you'd miss him.
Okay, you guys are making me really uncomfortable.
Oh, stop it, you big lug.
You would not have done --
I didn't know you were here.
Hello.
Hi, Lieutenant.
We were just gonna make dinner together.
I hope you two don't mind.
No.
No. How nice.
Night.
"Night"?
What the hell?
Shh! They can hear you!
I hope they can hear me!
They shouldn't be doing
whatever it is they're planning to do.
Frankie, go in there.
Me? I'm not going in there. You go in there.
No.
I hope you don't mind,
I'm gonna toss your mother around a bit, all right?
Shh!
Yeah, you know what? I mind!
We are minding!
Toss? Them? I can't. No.
