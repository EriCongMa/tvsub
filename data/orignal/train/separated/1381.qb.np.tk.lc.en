tessa , honey , you home ?
oh , she wanted to stay at kimmy &apos;s one more night .
parents aren &apos;t nearly as cool as kimmy .
mm , not a chance .
we having a red or a white ?
a pink .
raul the towel boy taught me his secret cocktail recipe .
it &apos;s on my phone .
raul with the muscles ?
when were you mixing cocktails with him ?
right after my husband
decided to cut our mexican vacation short
so he could make a business meeting .
you think i &apos;m jealous , but i &apos;m not .
i know you love this dad bod .
i do .
now , slice me a lemon .
yes , ma &apos;am .
you think raul would go all the way into the kitchen
to get you a lemon ?
thanks , sweetie .
gonna have to be a lime , hon .
that &apos;s fine .
thank heaven for tiny miracles , huh ?
if banyan hadn &apos;t left his blood on that cutting board ,
we wouldn &apos;t be starting the trial today
and he wouldn &apos;t be looking
at a long sentence for robbery and homicide .
witness list ?
yep .
m.e. report confirming banyan &apos;s blood on the cutting board ?
yep .
initial response report indicating
that hammonds &apos; side door was open ?
yes .
search warrant for banyan &apos;s apartment ?
yep . fat lot of good it did us .
no knife , no red emeralds .
oh , maybe nina can provide us
with some up to the minute good news ?
sorry , i double checked with ncic ,
and all the local pawn shop records .
unfortunately , the red emeralds
stolen from the house haven &apos;t turned up .
finding them after two years was a long shot .
thanks for making the calls .
thanks .
so , we have no murder weapon ,
and without the gems , we have no motive .
there &apos;s no chance we &apos;re gonna lose this case , are we ?
oh , we &apos;ve won cases with less than dna on a cutting board .
i &apos;m just glad we have this .
we have to meet banyan &apos;s lawyer
at the evidence warehouse in five minutes .
rizzoli .
what do you mean it &apos;s gone ?
i have no idea what happened .
after you checked out the cutting board
for trial prep last week ,
i put it right back where it belonged .
and nobody &apos;s checked it out since ?
no . other than you ,
it &apos;s been in the same spot for two years .
then when the defense sent their request
to review the evidence ,
i made myself a little note
to have it ready first thing this morning .
so , as soon as defense made the request , it disappears ?
yeah . here we are .
b572 .
no cutting board .
did you check the adjacent boxes ?
yes .
okay , we need to search every box in here .
there &apos;s four floors of evidence .
i really don &apos;t have the manpower for that .
you will .
thanks .
we got to call banyan &apos;s lawyer and tell him it &apos;s gone .
the lawyer &apos;s gonna move to dismiss the case .
hey , ma . it come yet ?
honey , you have the strangest shopping habits .
you opened it ?
what if it was private ?
you had it shipped to a bar !
so nina wouldn &apos;t see it .
she likes magic shows .
thought i &apos;d learn a few tricks , surprise her .
you &apos;re such a sweet , sweet boy .
awesome .
rizzoli .
what ?
all right , i &apos;m there .
sorry , ma . i got to go .
work .
of course it &apos;s work .
my kids always work .
bye !
bye !
is it possible that someone from your office
got the cutting board ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
and there &apos;s no other physical evidence
that ties banyan to the scene ?
no , but here &apos;s what we have .
we have the swab that we used to retrieve banyan &apos;s dna .
we have photos of the cutting board from the crime scene
and in the lab , and dna documentation proving
that it was banyan &apos;s blood .
the defense won &apos;t be able to dispute chain of custody .
it &apos;s a hail mary ,
but it might be enough to put in front of a judge .
&quot; hail mary &quot; is such an odd phrase .
you know , when it was coined in 1975 --
maura , jane go court now .
thanks . bye .
along with the photographs and lab report ,
the sworn testimony of chief medical examiner dr. maura isles
should be more than enough to proceed .
your honor , defense simply can &apos;t run its own forensic analysis
on a series of photographs .
if the people can &apos;t produce the cutting board for our review ,
this case needs to be dismissed .
counselors , approach the bench .
jane ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
tessa , something happened , okay ?
but we &apos;re -- we &apos;re working on it . okay ?
detective rizzoli .
just hang tight .
i &apos;ve been told there &apos;s a problem with evidence management .
uh , yes , your honor .
we , um -- we &apos;re working hard to produce the physical evidence
that the defense has asked for .
we just need some more time .
i sympathize with your predicament , detective ,
but without evidence , this case cannot go to trial .
as it is 4 : 00 p.m. friday , you have until 9 : 00 a.m. monday
to find this evidence ,
or else i &apos;ll be forced to grant defense &apos;s motion to dismiss .
next case .
banyan did this .
i don &apos;t know how he did it , but he did it .
well , we better get going ,
&apos;cause we &apos;ve only got 65 hours to undo it .
we &apos;ve already finished with rows 1 through 8 .
you can check rows 9 through 11 down there .
any luck ?
no cutting board in the first two sections .
we got 10 more sections to search on this floor .
any evidence missing from any other cases ?
it &apos;s definitely looking like a targeted job .
did you speak to the evidence officers who were on duty ?
none of them saw any suspicious activity .
banyan could &apos;ve paid one of them off .
i ran background checks on all employees
with access to the evidence room .
all of them long @-@ term employees , no apparent financial motive ,
no apparent ties to banyan .
so , if it &apos;s not an inside job ,
someone from the outside broke in .
only way in is the way we came .
what &apos;s up ?
banyan got someone to break in and steal the cutting board .
trying to figure out how they might &apos;ve got in .
is this the only point of entry ?
yeah . to be granted access ,
you have to enter a six @-@ digit code
that &apos;s changed every week .
yeah , and i &apos;m sure the system logs in the date
and time of everyone &apos;s entry .
yeah . those records are already on their way .
okay .
tell me about the security system .
the evidence officer we spoke to
said they recently upgraded the facility .
beside the keypad they put in a new climate @-@ control system
and additional security cameras .
get the footage from the last week .
we need to review that .
if the cutting board was only taken in the last day or two ,
maybe it &apos;s still out there .
it &apos;s a good thing ming &apos;s palace is open all night .
okay , what are we looking at ?
left side is a list of every date and time
that someone entered the evidence room .
and the right side is different
security camera feeds from the warehouse .
we &apos;re going through to see if we can identify the thief .
oh , right there , right there ! bottom right .
blow that up .
back it up .
now enhance it .
there &apos;s the code , clear as day .
nina , is this camera system closed circuit ?
yes , but sometimes these systems have a remote login function
so that supervisors can check in .
if our thief could log in remotely , he could get the code .
hang on .
most of these logins look like warehouse supervisors ,
but this one &apos;s anonymous .
that &apos;s how our crooks got the code .
is there any way to trace that login ?
yes , but it could take more time than we have .
okay , well , we know when they got the code ,
so let &apos;s just look for it every time it was used going forward .
hey , um , can i have the honey walnut shrimp ?
uh , yeah .
thanks .
there &apos;s no shrimp .
there &apos;s a lot of honey , a lot of walnuts .
hey , wait , someone just blacked out the camera
covering the entrance to the evidence room .
could they have gotten into the building
from another room down there ?
well , the only rooms down there are the maintenance room
and the evidence room .
they &apos;re made of concrete . no way in .
we need to look at all of banyan &apos;s associates ,
figure out who &apos;s smart enough to pull this off .
csru didn &apos;t find any physical evidence at the warehouse .
so , our thief got in and out without a trace ?
yeah , and no prints on the evidence box ,
but we will do a full battery of tests .
thank you .
kent ? what are you working on ?
oh , i , uh ...
i found him in the pond by my house this morning .
is it sick ?
yeah .
won &apos;t even take any water ,
not even this fancy stuff with added electrolytes and vitamins .
i got you a few liters i stuck on your desk .
thank you .
yeah , you &apos;re both healing . you ladies deserve the best .
was the pond you found it in dirty ?
aren &apos;t all ponds ?
well , if the water was polluted , a duck can contract botulism .
oh , of course .
good one , sergeant .
when i was a kid , my aunt had a place up on lake winnipesaukee .
i used to feed the ducks .
we may have some antitoxin on hand .
or you can just give it water with epsom salt .
right . old wives &apos; remedy .
the old wives are the ones
that gave me the bread to feed the ducks .
you know , you two are alike .
both animal lovers .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re alike .
no , me neither .
call me if you get something .
i &apos;m thinking of calling her mary , as in mary stuart .
as in mary , queen of scots ?
she deserves a royal name , don &apos;t you think ?
such a regal creature .
well , except mary stuart was executed by her cousin ,
queen elizabeth .
so , maybe she should have the name
of a queen that wasn &apos;t beheaded .
well , i &apos;m not gonna call her elizabeth .
no english queen is a queen to me .
billy mags was arrested with banyan in the &apos; 90s ,
but he &apos;s doing a 20 @-@ year bit at walpole .
&quot; whitey &quot; mccormick was hanging his hat
&quot; 白人 &quot;
at souza @-@ baranowski for the last year .
well , jones got in trouble with the law in mexico .
finch has been dead for two years .
frankie , what &apos;s going on with the prison logs ?
and the ball magically melds with the cup .
frankie !
what ?
i &apos;m on hold . they &apos;re taking forever to pull the logs .
moving at a snail &apos;s pace .
no .
i saw the second ball hit the table before the cup dropped .
you did not .
yeah .
no , yeah , i &apos;m still here .
are you sure ?
all right , thank you very much .
so , apparently the only person who visited banyan in prison
is his 82 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
no friends , barely any family .
who the hell is helping banyan ?
pizza and chinese , eh ?
yeah , it was a long night .
and there was a shrimp deficiency .
i did a particle trace analysis on the empty evidence box .
found traces of urea @-@ formaldehyde foam .
which is used for what ?
it &apos;s an insulation most commonly found
in old commercial buildings .
like the evidence warehouse .
yeah , except the only place we found it
was on the evidence box .
well , that means that the thief must have left it on the box
when he opened it to steal the cutting board .
didn &apos;t you say something about a climate system ?
yeah , they installed it six months ago
for better temperature and humidity control .
to install a new system ,
wouldn &apos;t you need to cut through walls ?
yes , you would .
yes , you would . thank you .
you &apos;re ... welcome .
all these vents required a cut through the wall
and the interior insulation .
hey , korsak , look at this .
you see the insulation ?
that vent look bigger than the other ones ?
yeah .
it &apos;s magnetized .
guess we know how they got into the building .
so , the thief built a tunnel
from outside to the maintenance room ,
walked across the hall ,
entered the entrance code to the evidence room ,
and stole our cutting board .
seems like something out of &quot; ocean &apos;s 11 . &quot;
or &quot; 12 . &quot; or &quot; 13 . &quot;
somebody &apos;s been planning this for a long time .
six months at least ,
since they installed the climate @-@ control system .
whoever &apos;s helping banyan was on that crew .
yeah . i already got a list from the contractor .
50 people altogether .
well , we better start digging .
we only have 41 hours left .
dig fast .
hi , i got your text . you found something ?
yes . csru found several hairs in that tunnel .
dna analysis shows they belong to a caucasian woman .
okay , well , that &apos;ll help narrow our search
for the construction crew .
thanks , maura .
you look tired .
jane , are you sure you don &apos;t want to lie down ,
take a little power nap , maybe 20 minutes ?
i don &apos;t have 20 minutes .
i &apos;m serious .
sleep deprivation could cause cognitive dysfunction ,
memory problems , even hallucinations .
you should tell the octopus in the corner to stop waving at me .
yeah .
good girl .
okay , this is the weirdest thing
i &apos;ve seen in the last week and a half .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s sick .
i couldn &apos;t very well leave her in the lab , could i ?
you have to take her back !
somebody might call the health department on me . ‬
the rights of nursing mothers should not be infringed upon
in the commonwealth .
what ?
all right , well , i know it &apos;s not the same thing ,
but surely the same principle applies .
okay , now i &apos;m more worried about you than i am the duck .
even though she &apos;s kind of sweet .
isn &apos;t she ?
hello .
yes , say hello , cleopatra . that &apos;s a good girl , yeah .
fancy name .
yeah , egyptian queen of the desert .
beloved by all .
i learned in my g.e.d. class that , uh ,
her brother tried to overthrow her , so she had him killed .
oh , right . so , maybe not cleopatra , then . ‬
what ?
okay , so the food &apos;s ready ,
and that &apos;s so nice of you to bring it to them .
thank you .
well , i guess we &apos;re just not as slammed
down in the m.e. &apos; s office as they are upstairs .
by the way , do you see , uh , frankie and nina a bit ?
how &apos;s that going ?
i guess you &apos;re gonna have to ask them .
we keep it strictly professional at work .
yeah . i can see .
hmm , fair point .
do you mind if i break her a wee bite off ,
see if she &apos;s hungry ?
oh , no , not that one .
why not ?
duck a l &apos;orange .
hey there . it &apos;s okay .
yeah .
there were only four caucasian women
on the construction crew
that installed the climate @-@ control system .
one of them , ashley marks ,
was hired two weeks before the job
and quit immediately after .
that &apos;s more than a little suspicious .
turns out she &apos;s a licensed heating
and cleaning service tech , but in chicago .
could she have been in town working ?
sure , if she hadn &apos;t been severely injured
in an accident three years ago .
according to these disability records ,
she hasn &apos;t worked since .
this also popped up in the search .
who &apos;s donna marks ?
ashley &apos;s sister .
she had several run @-@ ins with the law back in chicago .
she could &apos;ve used her sister &apos;s work i.d.
since she &apos;s been living here for six months .
she could be the one helping banyan .
is there anything linking them ?
e @-@ mails , cellphone records , love letters ?
i &apos;m looking , but nothing so far .
all right .
hey , will you text me her address ?
it &apos;s already in your phone .
sounds like she &apos;s home .
we got a runner !
boston police !
boston police !
all right , get down ! get down .
you &apos;re under arrest .
what &apos;d you do with the cutting board , donna ?
i found it .
you destroyed evidence
that could &apos;ve convicted a double murderer .
do you have any idea how much trouble you &apos;re in ?
what i can &apos;t figure out is why you did it .
you don &apos;t seem to know steve banyan .
there &apos;s no correspondence between the two of you at all .
there &apos;s no e @-@ mails , no texts , no phone calls , nothing .
you only moved to boston six months ago .
banyan &apos;s been locked up for two years .
why would you do something like this for a complete stranger ?
maybe it felt like a thrill .
yeah , you brought quite the rap sheet with you from chicago .
assault and battery , prostitution --
yeah , i know . i was there .
what i don &apos;t see there
is any higher education or technical training .
so ?
so you have no technical knowledge
to bypass a security system .
if you don &apos;t think i did it , then let me go .
no , no , no . we know you did it . we have your dna .
what we want to know is who planned it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . ‬
you know that if you give us a name ,
we can talk to the d.a. about reducing your sentence .
understand this , donna .
whoever planned this risked your ass , not theirs .
you really want to stand up for somebody like that ?
it &apos;s a pretty ring .
yes , it is .
tell me you have good news .
it appears she burned it , doused it in lighter fluid ,
and then she burned it again .
no traces of dna .
from the victim &apos;s kitchen .
so , you &apos;re telling me
that the only piece of evidence we have against banyan --
exists only in photographs and test results .
but you know that she broke in and she stole it ,
so can &apos;t you use that ?
no , not without a connection between banyan and donna ,
which we don &apos;t have .
so , what are you gonna do ?
keep digging , i guess .
well , i do have an extra set of clothes in my office
if you &apos;d like to dig in a fresh shirt .
at this point , it &apos;d be a public service . ‬
this ring belonged to donna .
what kind of stone is that ?
it &apos;s too light to be a sapphire or blue topaz .
my off @-@ the @-@ cuff assessment might be a blue benitoite .
extremely rare .
rare like red emeralds that were stolen from the hammond house ?
well , depends on clarity and color ,
but stones like this could go for $ 20,000 each .
are you thinking that donna and banyan pulled another job ?
maybe .
or maybe it was donna and the guy she &apos;s working for .
who &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
here we go .
come on .
looks like a radioactive booger .
okay , this is citrine . it &apos;s very fashionable .
also has the added benefit of being visible from space .
you can &apos;t see it from space .
i don &apos;t think .
morning , holiday .
is it morning ? i &apos;m losing track .
walk with me .
donna had a rare gemstone on her person --
blue benitoite .
search for thefts involving that stone .
okay .
i &apos;d expand my search outside of boston .
we &apos;re looking for donna &apos;s accomplice .
whoever she &apos;s protecting will connect back to banyan .
any cities you want me to focus on ?
well , chicago &apos;s donna &apos;s hometown .
how is this gonna help ?
it might not ,
but if we can find who banyan was working with ,
maybe we can get him to turn on banyan
in exchange for special treatment .
got it .
i &apos;ll meet you in bric . ‬
i got to take this to kent .
what , he can &apos;t fetch his own coffee ?
this isn &apos;t coffee .
i must be delusional from lack of sleep this weekend .
things are moving .
they &apos;re wormies for the wee duck .
wormies ?
‭ what would you call them ? ‬
disgusting ?
i &apos;ll see you in bric .
hi .
hi , what &apos;s up ?
i just put on a fresh pot .
should be ready soon .
i &apos;m trying to do the coin @-@ through @-@ the @-@ hand trick .
no , you &apos;re not .
okay , give me the coin .
what ?
give me the coin .
you &apos;re doing it all wrong .
you have to make it look effortless , okay ?
‭ seamless . cup your hands . ‬
like that ?
yeah , exactly . ‬
ready ? one , two , three .
what ? !
that was amazing !
yes , i know .
how &apos;d you learn that ?
do you remember when we were little
i always got to go to bed an hour after you ?
yeah .
well , that &apos;s because mom and dad
and i were up having really fun magic parties .
i always knew you guys were doing awesome stuff without me .
we were .
they also paid me 100 bucks for every trick i learned .
okay . you &apos;re joking .
no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re joking .
come on , nina &apos;s got something for us .
seriously , you &apos;re joking , right ?
no .
what do you mean ? you are joking about that .
okay , what do we got ?
three unsolved gem thefts in the chicago area .
all private residences in wealthy suburbs .
no arrests were made .
jadeite and musgravite in glencoe ,
painite in lake forest ,
and your blue benitoite in highland park .
okay , whoever donna is working for
has to have his hand in all of these .
did the chicago departments connect these robberies ?
no , but i called and let them know .
maybe it &apos;s not just chicago .
you think he hit other cities ?
well , he &apos;s got donna in chicago , banyan in boston .
i &apos;ll widen the search nationwide .
okay .
i know .
well , it &apos;s just so ... bright .
i think my pupils are still adjusting .
it &apos;s citrine .
you know , technically i think that &apos;s a jewel tone .
you know , technically i think you &apos;re ma &apos;s daughter .
here we go .
five more cities .
total of eight more places .
we &apos;re gonna need case files for all of them .
and 2.1 / 2 more weeks to go through them .
we talked to cops on all eight other gem thefts .
the pattern &apos;s the same as our victim &apos;s .
in every case , the thieves stole distinctive stones
from wealthy gem collectors ,
and they all got through high @-@ end security systems .
canton , ohio , was the only other case besides ours
where the victims were home .
they were also murdered . amy and sam reichart .
eight thefts with two additional murders .
how did we not see this two years ago ?
we had no reason to look for it .
they were all out of our jurisdiction ,
and we had an open and shut case .
the cleveland cops are calling the case the houdini whodunit .
and why &apos;s that ?
because they have no idea how the thieves got in or out .
what about the other locations ?
entry point was unclear for all the other cases ,
except for canton .
the front door was open .
so , we have no idea how they got in or out ,
but they left the door open in the homes
where they murdered someone ?
what if banyan was already in the house
when the hammonds got home ?
and killing them is what forced him to leave through a door ?
exactly . he deviated from his original plan .
which was what ?
go out the same way he came in .
which was how ?
i don &apos;t know , but the evidence warehouse ,
they came in through the vent ,
so maybe there &apos;s something we missed .
kent !
and your friend .
still here .
yeah .
rihanna and i have just been out shopping .
rihanna ?
oh , yeah , the queen of barbados .
that &apos;s the reason i got some bling .
well , i got something for you , too .
does it sparkle ?
ha , ha , very funny .
it &apos;s a new restorative yoga clinic
that &apos;s opened up next door to the pet store .
yeah , rihanna was feeling so much better after a little exercise ,
i thought that maybe you could you know .
thank you . i &apos;ll check it out .
so , does this mean she &apos;s fully recovered ?
yeah .
better than ever , aren &apos;t you , rihanna ?
well , you know what this means .
yep .
i am the duck whisperer .
&quot; a &quot; -- you need more human friends .
and &quot; b &quot; -- she &apos;s ready to go home .
yeah .
i guess you &apos;re right .
i guess i just got a little bit attached .
oh , i know it &apos;s hard .
but sooner or later , you have to let go .
bye , rihanna .
what does she know ?
exactly . that &apos;s what i thought . come on .
hey , nina !
angela .
hi . jane and frankie are out on a case .
oh , that &apos;s okay . i was just bringing in
some reinforcements for everybody .
ah , thank you .
we ran right through the last batch .
italian is my favorite .
is that right ?
frankie &apos;s been teaching me to cook .
we did chicken parm last week .
well ...
that &apos;s a first .
is that right ?
well , he only cooks for me on mother &apos;s day .
maybe i &apos;ll get him to work on that .
you two seem to have a lot in common , don &apos;t you ?
well , we have a few differences .
i love the opera .
oh , opera , no .
he was brought up on motown .
no way .
well , that would explain
why i could never get him to a show with me .
yeah , he &apos;d much rather be at any game , any sport .
he can have them .
oh , tell me about it .
frankie sr. used to get us bruins tickets .
front row , blue line .
anybody who got checked into the boards ,
frankie would cheer !
i would scream .
‭ you had front @-@ row tickets ? ‬
well , his father used to say ,
&quot; i know a guy who knows a guy . &quot;
can i tell you a little secret ?
okay .
i don &apos;t think frankie will ever be as good of a cook as you .
does he think he will be ?
he thinks he &apos;s close .
well , other than a healthy sense of delusion ,
he &apos;s a great son .
yeah .
he really is a great guy .
i haven &apos;t been back here since mom and dad were ...
hey , tessa .
why don &apos;t you go back to your aunt &apos;s house .
okay ? we can lock up when we &apos;re done .
i really wanted to help .
and you have .
detective rizzoli &apos;s in the squad car outside .
why don &apos;t you let him take you home .
okay .
thank you .
there &apos;s the a / c vent .
that can &apos;t be more than 10 inches wide .
nobody getting through there .
no .
all right , let &apos;s search the rest of the house .
hey , court &apos;s first thing tomorrow .
did you see her face ?
we can &apos;t leave until we find something
that keeps that bastard in jail .
korsak !
look at this .
the frame &apos;s a little scratched ,
but there doesn &apos;t seem to be any other signs of tampering .
all the screws are intact .
thanks . his buddy was meticulous .
he could &apos;ve had him just replace everything as he went .
except look here .
the sheathing &apos;s sticking out .
right , so if the seal was broken ,
that would explain the condensation on the table ,
the water mark on the rug .
when we photographed the crime scene ,
they wouldn &apos;t have been here ,
but two years of rain and snow , there you go .
i just got off the phone with nina .
all the other robbery sites had skylights .
and they &apos;re not usually meant to be open ,
so they wouldn &apos;t be wired to the security system .
hey , guys , i know i &apos;ve not been to the gym in a while , but ...
there &apos;s no way one man could &apos;ve lifted that down on his own .
no , you &apos;re right . somebody was here with him .
banyan and his partner pulled this job together .
whose blood is that ?
you &apos;re sure that &apos;s blood ?
it &apos;s a little eroded and oxidized , but yeah .
we always thought that banyan cut his hand
on a knife on the cutting board .
he could &apos;ve done it right there .
if that &apos;s banyan &apos;s blood , we can lock him up for good .

this case is hereby dismissed without prejudice .
mr. banyan , you &apos;re free to go .
what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
my client would like to go home .
i thought i was a free man .
yeah , we wanted you to think that .
mr. banyan had a partner .
he orchestrated multiple robbery @-@ homicides across the country .
and he had donna marks break into the evidence warehouse
and destroy the cutting board .

that &apos;s what we need to know .
and we needed you to look like a free man
so we could draw your partner out .

i think i even called out her name .
not so much as a look back .
she may not have responded because
she was actually a he .
