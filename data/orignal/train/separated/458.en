All That Remains
Mom, your pearls, really?
Oh, I think they're nice.
Just try them.
Wow, look at you!
You're so pretty, Sera.
Isn't she, Dad?
Just like her mom.
Oh, stop.
Let me do it.
Ok.
All right, you got it?
Yeah.
All right, here you go.
If this guy touches you, he's dead.
I'm serious.
Dad.
Just please don't say that to him.
Stop embarrassing her, Bruce.
I want to go to homecoming.
Soon enough, little one.
I am not so little.
911. What's your emergency?
Oh, God.
Hello? What's your emergency?
Is anyone there? Hello?
Sir?
They're gone. My girls are gone.
I need your help.
When you say girls, do you mean your daughters?
Yes.
All right, I need you to stay on the line, sir.
Please confirm where you're calling from.
1721 Hillcrest Drive.
This can't be happening.
What's your name, sir?
Bruce. Bruce Morrison.
How old are your daughters, Mr. Morrison?
13 and 17.
When was the last time you saw them?
They went to bed around 9:30.
No, wait. It was Monday.
Sera has a study group, so it was more like 10:00.
Sir, today is Wednesday.
You haven't seen them since Monday?
No. No, that can't be right.
I'm sorry, sir, but it is.
Today is Wednesday.
No.
The police have been alerted, sir, and they're on their way.
That call came in an hour ago.
How does a single father
lose his teenage daughters for 36 hours?
He doesn't.
His girls are gone.
He doesn't blame anyone.
And he doesn't use any buzzwords
first responders are trained to hear.
He never says missing, abducted, runaway.
Maybe that's what they did, though. Maybe they ran away.
There's no history of that.
The likelihood of a stranger abduction
in a neighborhood like this is rare.
I've counted 7 turns from the entrance to their driveway.
No one just stumbled onto the house.
And where's the mother?
Could this be a parental child abduction?
Uh, doubtful. Exactly one year ago today he made this call.
911. Please state your emergency.
My wife is gone.
Confirm where are you calling from.
1721 Hillcrest Drive.
She'd also been missing for two days
before he contacted authorities, and she's never been found.
This man is either the victim of a serial offender
or he is one.
Please tell me this guy's in custody.
The Salisbury police are at his home
and they've been there since the call came in.
There are hard copies and tablet copies
of both case files on the plane.
It's a short flight to the Eastern Shore.
There'll be more when you land.

It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals.
It dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."

Bruce and Judy Morrison
were well liked and active in the community.
All signs point to them living a quiet life.
He's a writer and a professor,
and it looks like she got into real estate a few years ago.
'02, before the market crashed.
Well, 10 years later Judy had an affair with a co-worker,
a Jeff Godwin?
That was discovered in the investigation
but never made it in the papers.
Bruce Morrison was a prime suspect,
but they never found any evidence
and the affair wasn't deemed enough of a motive.
The university's put him on sabbatical since then.
He's been writing forever, and he's been teaching since 1985.
Transcript says he was grief-stricken
and couldn't handle the pressure.
Not many people could.
The odds of this event striking the same family
on the same day must be a billion to one.
Close enough.
Judy inherited money from her family
and it's in a trust for the girls.
Ah, jeez, please tell me
he did not get rid of his wife for money.
Bank records indicate he hasn't touched the funds,
despite the depleting supplemental income from the university.
Yeah, but it could be a combo platter.
Revenge and profit.
His wife cheated and he retaliated in anger.
That might not be a surprise, but that doesn't explain
why he would harm his own children.
The oldest daughter Sera had a 4.0 gpa,
but she didn't apply to a single college back east.
She accepted a Stanford early admission.
Maybe her father saw going that far away as a form of betrayal.
The second one in a year.
First his wife of 27 years fools around
and then probably threatens to end the marriage.
A year later, the daughter can't wait to leave.
Abandonment could be the common denominator.
There is another possibility.
Maybe Bruce Morrison didn't do it.
The family have any enemies?
The only person that might fit that would be Jeff Godwin.
Looks like he had a pretty solid alibi
the night Judy went missing.
He was wining and dining his own wife
at a local restaurant.
So the only viable suspect back then
was the same one we have now.
All the answers are in that house.
Marty Friedman. Thanks for making the trip.
We got search and rescue combing the woods
and the Choptank and Wicomico rivers.
We're dredging all the way from here to the Chesapeake.
I'm not letting this guy get away with it again.
Has he said why he took a day to call?
Claims he doesn't remember.
He's been glued to his computer.
Maybe he needs new material for a novel.
We'll work alongside your team if that's all right.
Whatever you need.
Everybody take a room.
Mr. Morrison,
I'm Aaron Hotchner from the FBI.
My team's here to help gather information to find your children.
I'm glad you're here.
But shouldn't you be out there looking for my girls?
We have to start where they were last seen.
I know you think I did this.
They all do.
Sir, we're not here to accuse you.
We want to find your daughters.
Well, so do I.
So if someone calls with a ransom demand,
do you have the means to trace the call?
No one's calling.
We'll have our analyst set up what we call a trap and trace
back at Quantico.- Thanks.
I'm told you have Sera's phone.
It's on the dining room table.
And Katie's phone?
I looked for it in her room. I couldn't find it.
I've made some flyers.
Detective, would it be possible
for one of your officers to help get them out?
That's a good idea.
It looks like Katie stayed in a lot.
She has a schedule of when she was gonna try new recipes.
She seems like a really sweet girl.
Her charger's here but the phone is not.
Maybe it's with her?
Yeah, I'll have Garcia track it.
It'll only work if it's on, though.
It's worth a try.
If the girls had access to a phone and they were ok,
they would have called for help by now.
Nothing in the past year since her mom disappeared.
It looks like she kept it all bottled up.
Except when she was assigned to write.
There's a lot of papers in here from her creative writing class.
Her dad's a writer and English professor.
Maybe she was trying to get his attention.
What is it?
Are most high school seniors this neat?
Trash is empty. Bed's perfectly made.
So is that what he did for two days,
clean the house?
We let the housekeeper go
when I was forced to take a sabbatical last year.
Are you angry about that?
Angry? I don't have the energy for that anymore.
How are you keeping up with everything?
The girls and I do the best we can.
Judy liked an orderly house,
and I keep hoping that she'll walk back through that door.
You just did laundry but only your clothes.
I was wondering, did you do that
before or after you called 911?
I did it when I woke up in the morning,
before I knew the girls were missing.
Mr. Morrison, you understand that we can only help you
if you tell us everything that happened.
Katie was asleep when Sera came home late.
She said that she drove slow because of the rain.
That's all I remember.
Oh, and I was watching basketball.
And then?
I went to bed, I guess.
It's happened before.
I can't explain it,
but the next thing I know, it's morning.
And I could feel that something was wrong.
Sera, you're late!
Katie, Sera, your alarm's going off.
Did you oversleep?
Girls!
Girls!
Sera.
Girls?
Katie?
Girls!
Katie! Sera!
911. What's your emergency?
Oh, my god.
Hello? What's your emergency?
Is anyone there? Hello? Sir?
They're gone. My girls are gone.
I need your help.
I just--I can't stand here and do nothing.
I have Judy's sister coming in.
We have to find the girls.
How much longer do you need to be standing here.
Shouldn't we be out there looking?
Hello.
Hi, Karen.
No, nothing yet.
All right, thanks.
So, he does own a 12-gauge shotgun.
The police catalogued it a year ago.
But ballistics proved
that it hadn't been fired in years.
Where is it now?
He claims he doesn't know, but I'm not finished.
He also bought a used .38
just after Judy's disappearance,
and now he claims he doesn't know where that is either.
Well, if he used it, it might explain
why he threw his clothes in the wash this morning.
So the clothes would be compromised.
He did sleep in here, though.
We should have these sheets tested for gunshot residue.
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me.
Will you bag the sheets, please?
There's some muddy boots by the back door.
We should test those, too.
Well, it appears he still sleeps on his side of the bed.
Look at that.
His wife's things haven't been cleaned out.
Maybe he really is in mourning.
Our analyst is checking phone logs.
We did the same last year,
but it's like Judy Morrison just vanished.
I couldn't even find her phone or appointment book
to see who her last meetings were with.
Take a look at this.
When does recycling get picked up?
Monday mornings.
So these are new.
Last year he said he was in recovery
but had fallen off the wagon because of Judy's affair.
He hasn't mentioned this at all.
I always thought he was drinking more than he admitted.
Wondered if he was popping pills, too,
but we could never find any evidence.
Well, let's go ask him.
Mr. Morrison,
did the girls leave often without you knowing?
No. Look, I've told you everything.
I gotta ask you,
are two bottles of bourbon a normal Monday night?
It wasn't really two.
There was only a little bit left in the first one.
It was a rough day.
Monday was the year anniversary of when Judy went missing.
You think we don't know that?
There haven't been many days this year
when I haven't been very aware of your wife having gone missing.
What happened Monday?
Did it all come rushing back and you just snapped?
No. I was sad and I drank too much
because I miss my wife.
Honestly, bourbon doesn't help much.
It helped you lose an entire day from what I can tell.
Why don't we head upstairs.
Detective.
Look, I understand that you're frustrated,
but you're not helping yourself taking it out on him.
I thought this guy was dirty a year ago,
and now it's happened again.
There are no bodies, no evidence,
no nothing but my gut and 25 years of police work.
Hey, baby girl.
Have you found them yet?
I'm about to join the search.
Good. Ok. I don't know the location of Katie's cell,
which means the battery's dead, but I pulled phone records
for both the girls, and holy cannoli,
they text more than I do.
More Sera than Katie, but still...
Anything suspicious?
It looks like just friendly, rapid-fire repeat numbers,
probably all known contacts.
Uh, last activity was Monday at 9:55 p.m.
Well, that matches the dad's story.
I'm wading through the most used numbers first.
I will hit you back when I know who's who.
I'm hanging up hard, like the strength of my love.
She had a lot of hobbies before she started selling real estate.
Yeah, family projects.
Devoted mom.
You ready, Reid?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Do you mind if I ask you a question.
He killed them, too, did he?
Sorry?
Did that son of a bitch hurt his daughters?
Sir, how well do you know the family?
They moved in when we did.
My wife always liked his wife.
And you and Mr. Morrison?
Got nothing in common with that drunk.
Told me he was gonna shoot my dog.
I used to let my girls, you know, roam around the yard here.
They'd bark occasionally, but never too long.
And then one night that idiot comes out,
hammered,
and he tells me that he can't work
because my dog's yapping.
And then he says he wouldn't be surprised
if one of them was found dead.
The man is nuts.
The Morrison girls were last seen Monday night.
Did you see them at all?
No. But Morrison sounded drunk and belligerent again.
It was about 10:00.
He didn't tell you that, did he?
Were both cars home?
Well, I'm not spying on the guy or anything,
but we were out here a little later.
I noticed his car was gone.
Then when I turned "Letterman" off,
it was back.
Why did you stop going to your meetings?
I was two years sober.
Then Judy has this affair.
I guess I needed something, so I started drinking again.
What would you do?
Your daughters testified that you and Judy had had a fight
the night that she disappeared.
That's right. So?
And a neighbor heard an argument here on Monday night.
Who told you that, chip Gordon?
He's a lonely old man.
And since when is having an argument with teenagers
against the law? It doesn't mean I hurt them.
Did you?
No!
Yeah, Morgan, what do you got?
How much does the alcohol abuse account for the time lost?
I don't know.
It doesn't mean that I hurt my daughters.
Where are Katie and Sera?
I don't know!
Hotch.
Sera could be close!
I want teams working a 5-mile radius!
Keep working upstream!
Get those dogs working!
5 miles down!
We found Katie's body in the reeds.
It's near, uh...
Katie, Katie...
So what do you think?
I don't know.
He's sober, so this is raw emotion.
He lost his legs when Hotch told him.
The tears could be guilt as much as grief.
Because that's what we're supposed to do
when given that news.
I don't mean to sound so cynical,
but the man writes fiction.
Any sign of Sera?
Maybe she's still out there.
Doubtful, unless she's found shelter.
It's supposed to be in the 20s tonight.
Now that we've got Katie's body,
we should run scenarios for what really happened on monday night.
That was the lab. Bruce definitely fired a gun at some point.
There's residue on the sheets and on the boots.
We need to get him to the station.
Biotic decomposition is slower in the winter months,
and since her body wasn't immersed in the river,
it wasn't deteriorated,
so I can tell you a little more than I thought.
Sorry.
I knew Katie.
She and my daughter were in class together.
We're sorry.
Me, too.
She was killed between 24 and 48 hours ago.
COD is blunt force trauma to the squama of the occipital bone.
Like from the butt of a gun?
That's possible.
So she was found near the river but she didn't drown?
No fluid in her lungs.
The water was only a method of disposal.
Her nails have traces of skin packed under them.
So we need to look for defensive wounds on her father.
Mr. Morrison, I need to ask you to roll up your sleeves.
What?
Please.
I saw these in the shower this morning when I woke up.
I have no idea how I got them.
Did they happen during the fight?
It wasn't a fight. It was just parenting.
Did the detective tell you about Jeff Godwin?
You should talk to him.
He still coaches Sera's soccer team,
even though it's ridiculous.
Every time I ask you a question,
you have this habit of deflecting attention onto someone else.
All of her latest writing assignments are very dark.
Yeah, I saw those, too.
I'm sure it's part of her mom's absence.
Well, she's had her fair share of suffering.
All right, so you think she's alive.
Yeah, I have to.
If losing her mother didn't change everything...
I know losing her sister certainly will.
I didn't know.
How old were you when your sister died?
11.
She was 17.
Go ahead, Garcia.
I think I may have found something creepy.
There's a bunch of text messages between Sera
and a number that I have traced back to Jeff Godwin.
Why would your missing mother's ex-lover stay in touch?
More than a little inappropriate.
And here's a text from J.G.
Please tell me there was nothing strange
going on between him and the daughter.
It seems more fatherly. Listen to this.
"It's gonna be ok. You just have to stay strong.
Is he encouraging her to leave?
Or for her to face her father in some way?
Well, what about the texts on monday?
There aren't any.
The latest were from sunday night.
No, no, no, yes, there are. I'm looking at the phone records.
There's texts between them on monday between 5:23 and 5:56 p.m.
Weird.
Yeah.
Hey, Blake.
Morgan, we need you to find Jeff Godwin.
Uh, he just walked in.
He did?
Says he heard we found Katie
and he's worried about Sera.
He also texted Sera the night she went missing
and then deleted the texts.
It looks like they texted a lot.
Really?
Mr. Godwin, why did you feel it was appropriate
to regularly text a 17-year-old girl?
I've know those girls for a long time,
way before anything happened between me and their mother.
Look, I coach Sera.
You didn't think to request a different team,
given the circumstances?
No. My daughter plays on the team.
Look, Sera reached out to me monday night.
God knows she needs a father figure.
Maybe the man her mother had an affair with
might not be the best person to offer that.
Look, I just came in here because I heard about Katie
and I was worried about Sera. Don't treat me like a criminal.
Sera deleted texts that the two of you shared
the same day she disappeared.
Hey, wait, ok. They're all here.
We agreed to meet in the parking lot
of a convenience store on Route 113.
Read them. Go ahead.
Is this a regular thing for you?
Well, we've met there a couple times recently,
when she was really scared
about what was happening with her and her dad.
What was happening?
Bruce gets really violent when he drinks,
and it's been getting worse.
Sera had every reason to be terrified.
I mean, look what happened.
Is everyone there?
Um, this call came in on Monday.
It was made on Katie's cell, which is still MIA.
The only 800 number she called
was to a local abuse hotline.
She called there a few times in the last couple of months.
My name is Katie Morrison. I called last week.
Yes, Katie, I remember you.
He's at it again. He's just going crazy.
He's really drunk.
Katie, are you safe?
Yes. Hold on.
Hi, it's Sera. We're ok. I can handle this.
Who are they taking to?
Girls, open the door!
I don't understand.
Katie, open the door.
Just stop now!
I said open the door!
It's a lay-up.
Off the rim...
Have you even talked to Katie today?
Shh...
Are you serious, dad?
You are such a pathetic father.
Get out of my way!
Girls, open the door!
Katie?
Open the door.
I said open the door!
I said open the door!
Oh, my god.
What a pathetic little crybaby.
Ugh. I was always right about you, huh?
So you got old Brucie in a cage, huh?
You think that's gonna help?
It's only gonna make him hide longer.
What do you want to know?
I'm gonna have to tell you 'cause the baby's got his pacifier.
Where's Sera?
She's learning a lesson.
What did you do to them?
What did you do to them?
I scared them, that's all. They needed it.
Why?
Because they're spoiled, ungrateful little bitches
who walk all over him any chance they get.
What happened to to Bruce?
He's hiding, of course.
See...
When he can't handle it, I save his ass.
Bruce's problem is,
he can't handle anything.
I give you a psychopath, but dual personality?
If that's true, where was that guy a year ago?
These conditions have triggers.
His accelerated drinking could have agitated it.
With all due respect, I don't buy it.
The guys knows he's dead meat
and this is an easy way to cop an insanity plea.
I hear you, but we need to see if he's got markers
for a dissociative identity disorder.
You do what you need to do. I think it's a waste of time.
So Bruce said Katie baked cookies Monday night.
We found them in the kitchen, so that's true.
And two of Sera's friends confirmed
she never made it to her study group.
That's because Jeff Godwin was in the parking lot
with her from 8:15 to 9:30.
And the girls called the hotline at 9:58.
Detective, have your officers found either gun?
No, but we've increased the search,
given where Katie's body was found.
We've got residue, but we don't know
which gun or where it is now.
Look, whoever that was in there
said he wanted to scare them, not hurt them.
Katie was beaten over the head in the middle of nowhere.
You're right. The alter could have lost his temper,
or it could have just been a horrible accident.
But getting the girls out of the house was planned.
He said he wanted to scare them and had a gun to do it.
And then he drove them somewhere.
Bruce's car had the same mud on the driver's side floor
that he had on his boots, but there wasn't any in the backseat.
So 3 people drove somewhere,
but only he came back.
And the DNA coming back from Katie's nails
will tell us what we already know--
that Bruce Morrison did this.
So can I arrest him now?
Detective, you have sufficient evidence to make the arrest,
but we still don't have Sera.
Give us an hour and maybe he'll tell us where she is.
It's your call, but he could still help us.
Ok. One hour.
What happened?
What do you remember?
You played me some tape of the girls,
and then I don't know.
When did your blackouts start?
In grad school.
There was a lot of pressure and I'd drink.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I couldn't do that.
Please tell me I didn't do that.
There's no way for us to confirm a D.I.D. diagnosis yet,
but we do know that he has chronic alcoholism,
which can and has gone hand in hand with it.
The interesting thing is, his liver and pancreas
wouldn't have survived 30 years of that kind of abuse,
so there must have been years where he's gotten help.
He was in a program.
It would have to be more than that. Garcia,
has he ever been on medication to help curb his drinking?
All I've got is a yearly physical and that is it.
D.I.D. usually stems from a history of sexual abuse.
Ok, well, I've got nothing like that.
All I have known Bruce Morrison
is that his mother died when he was 10...
There's your abandonment issue.
And he was raised by a single alcoholic father,
and there's no evidence of any prescriptions.
They look like the perfect family,
but she would have had to
know about his drinking when they got married.
So you're saying she helped manage him
and kept his problem a secret.
Maybe she was the one that got the prescription.
Garcia, can you run her medical history?
Yeah. Hold on...
Ok. Disulfiram.
Am I saying that right? It's for chronic alcoholism.
She had a 90-day supply delivered 4 times a year
for as long as I can tell.
And it stopped coming a few months ago.
It makes you just feel nauseous if you drink alcohol.
But she isn't the one who had a drinking problem. He is.
Garcia, who canceled it?
Please hold while I dig.
Could that be the trigger?
He goes after his daughters now that he's off his meds?
That instability could work for us.
Hey, I--I didn't--
Hey, I didn't agree to this.
Well, we're looking for Sera,
and you're the last ones to see her alive.
Look, like I told your guy here,
I had nothing to do with this. And Sera's afraid of him.
Do you want to tell us about your relationship with Sera?
I don't have one.
Well, that's strange.
Why do you text her all the time, then?
Jeff, it's not that big of a leap.
You couldn't have Judy anymore, so you thought...
Why not? Sera looks just like her mom.
Stop! Back up! Back up!
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!
Get him out! Get him out now.
Easy!
Judy was gonna leave my boy for that scumbag.
What's your name?
What's your name?
I'm Jennifer.
Your turn.
My name is Johnny and I need a cigarette, Jennifer.
Well, I might be able to help you out there.
I'm sure you're stressed.
Oh, I'm not.
I just want a smoke.
Johnny, come on.
I know these teenage girls stress you out,
no matter what you say.
I mean, how do you deal with it?
Do you like to, um...
go out and shoot something?
Sometimes.
But I don't get much chance to do that.
Oh, I thought you did have a chance recently.
I think you did.
Now, you know, I'm just-- I'm just curious.
And then I'll go get you that cigarette.
I like you, Jennifer.
So...
You took the girls somewhere to scare them.
Somewhere quiet
and isolated...
near the water?
I didn't do anything but scare 'em.
Of course not.
Do you have a place by the river?
Pretty and smart.
It's not my place.
It's not anybody's place anymore.
I've taken them out there before, but this time,
I got their attention.
Sera!
Sera! Sera!
Sera!
Sera!
Sera!
Sera!
Here's a shotgun blast.
Katie's phone. It's dead.
Sera could still be out there somewhere.
We gotta keep looking.
Morgan, stop, stop.
Sera?
Sera, we're with the FBI.
It's ok.
Put the gun down.
Sera, I know you don't feel like talking,
but if you think you can, there's some things I need to know,
and I can't ask anyone else but you.
He killed my mother, too, didn't he?
It's hard to say
unless we find her body.
I want to talk to him. Would that be ok?
Of course.
Will you come with me?
Let's get you warmed up first, ok?
There you go.
Are you a mom?
Mine used to wrap me in this quilt
that she made before I was born.
She said she always knew it would be for her little girl.
I miss her.
I'm so sorry.
Dad, you need help.
Did I do that?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What can I do?
They say that if you just tell them where mom is
that this will all just be--
But I don't know. You know I don't know.
She didn't just disappear, dad.
Oh, god, you killed her, didn't you?
No. No, I didn't.
How am I supposed to believe you?
This. This is what you've done.
You have hurt us all for a long time.
No, don't, Sera. Don't go.
Sera...
The detective said my aunt was coming. Which one?
Karen. She's driving in from Charleston.
Are you cold?
A little bit. The thermostat's right there.
It should warm up soon.
Think you'll be able to sleep?
Yeah, I want a shower first.
Um, sure you're gonna be OK up there?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Um, I could make us some tea.
That'd be really nice. Thanks.
一切都好吗 -不确定
What's wrong?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
She's just...too casual
and almost cold since we got here.
It could be the shock.
I know, but she's composed at the same time.
She has not mentioned Katie to me, even once, since we got here.
I couldn't walk into my house after my sister died,
let alone walk past her room.
Well, what do you think, JJ, Sera pulled it off?
I certainly think it may be a possibility.
It's a very detailed plan.
What, she knew about her father's condition
and took advantage of it?
She set up character witnesses like Jeff Godwin
to back up her fear.
Sera!
She even got her little sister to make calls to a hotline.
He's at it again. He's just going crazy.
She manipulated us from the minute we found her.
Her writing suggested no empathy
and no real emotional connection to family.
Psychopathic tendencies.
Her wounds are more than superficial,
but they could be self-inflicted, right, JJ?
Honey, I know. Mommy is sorry that she's not home tonight, OK?
But Amy's there with you
and I promise I will be home as soon as I can.
You OK? I didn't hear the shower.
Yeah. I just wanted my tea.
Oh, um, I was gonna bring it to you, but it should be ready.
Uh, yeah, I'm still here.
We'll be right there. Stay on the phone.
Mommy's gotta go.
I want Hotch to see the video of Sera.
Garcia, did you ever find out who canceled his prescription?
Uh, it turns out to cancel one of those lifelong prescriptions,
you actually have to put it in writing,
and according to the company records,
it was canceled by an S. Morrison.
Why did you have to come down here?
We've been looking for that.
It's an old house. I know the best hiding places.
But you, what do you think you know?
You put everything that went missing with your mother
inside this box.
1999.
Maybe my dad did it.
No. Now, you chose this box
because it's the year Katie was born
and everything changed.
She was your little sister.
Katie ruined everything and my mother let her.
Your mother loved you.
Well, she loved Katie more.
I should have cried for Katie.
I guess there's some things I just can't fake.
You won't do it.
You need to back up-- now.
I can say my trauma kicked in.
PTSD.
I saw you with the gun and I didn't know what else to do.
You thought of everything.
Sera, put the gun down.
No, no, you don't understand.
She has a gun. She was going to hurt me.
No. No, Sera, it's OK.
Listen to me.
I understand.
It's OK, Sera.
She wasn't gonna hurt you.
I know. You've been through enough.
All right? I get it.
Sera, you're safe now.
OK. Thank you.
Thank you.
What are you doing?!
You're a smart girl, Sera. Figure it out.
No, stop it! I swear, please!
No, I swear to you, she was trying to hurt me!
Please stop. Please, let me go.
Let me go. No, you don't understand. Please listen.
February 4th. The day Judy went missing.
Trophies. If Detective Friedman had ever found it,
she would have pinned it all on Bruce.
