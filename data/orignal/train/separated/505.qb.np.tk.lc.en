scream
my sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law died in 9 / 11 .
they had a baby girl , meg .
i took her in .
actually , chris and i moved into their house .
she &apos;s 13 , and the light of my life .
make sure you &apos;re home on time ,
otherwise the search party &apos;s coming for you .
make sure you text me when you land
or i &apos;ll send one for you .
i love you .
love you , too .
see you in the morning .
omg , he messaged us back .
he is so hot .
could you imagine if he was your boyfriend ?
he &apos;s asking for a picture .
you &apos;re not actually sending one , are you ?
well , he &apos;s a senior . what &apos;s the big deal ?
how the hell do you think it makes me feel , huh ?
i said i &apos;m sorry .
i bust my butt at work all day
and all i ask for is a hot meal .
honey , i &apos;m sorry , please .
i know this is my fault .
you think i want to do this ?
look , i know you had a hard day at work .
no !
i had a rough day .
rough day at work . say it right .
i &apos;m sorry .
you had a rough day .
so why do you have to make it worse ?
i &apos;ll do better . i promise .
i &apos;m tired of giving you second chances .
damn .
you look like you could use this more than me .
oh , my hero .
hey , meg , let &apos;s go !
you &apos;re gonna be late for school .
coming .
thank you .
i saw that .
good morning to you , too .
hey , can i go to the mall with markayla
and a couple of other friends this weekend ?
do these couple of other friends have names ?
bobby and tyler .
ok , those are weird names for girls .
they &apos;re in my biology class .
ok , well , do these friends know that kate has a gun ?
hey , stop that .
you &apos;re right .
technically , she &apos;s got two guns .
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;m kidding . yes , of course you can go .
thanks , chris . i need to text markayla and let her know .
ok , what was that ?
what ? it &apos;s not a date .
she &apos;s going to the mall , it &apos;s a public place .
with two boys that we &apos;ve never met .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s such a big deal .
we had a plan for her dating .
this is not a date .
i have 3 guns , by the way .
come on , sweetheart .
over the last 3 weeks ,
the bodies of myia collins and lauren white
have been found in diamond bar , california ,
a suburb 25 miles east of los angeles .
both victims were found in alley dumpster .
each had her throat slashed and had been brutally beaten .
this guy literally dumped his victims like trash .
classic misogynist sadist .
definitely looks like the torture escalates with each attack .
these women weren &apos;t just cut , they were beaten to a pulp .
that feels personal .
it &apos;s possible the unsub knew both victims ,
or at the very least used them as surrogates
for the true object of his anger .
he abducts , offends , and disposes of each victim
before anyone notices they &apos;re gone .
he may be preying on loner types .
it looks like they both have ligature marks
on their wrists and ankles .
which means he has a secure secondary location
where he holds them captive .
so he could be testing how much torture his victims can take .
and then when he &apos;s done with his fun ,
if things don &apos;t go as planned ,
he silences them permanently by slitting their throats .
the preliminary m.e. report shows that neither of the victims
were sexually assaulted .
maybe he &apos;s impotent .
or the abuse is what really turns him on .
either way , he &apos;s enjoying their pain .
and he &apos;s gonna want to experience that again .
wheels up in 30 .
william.r. alger once said ,
&quot; men often make up in wrath what they want in reason . &quot;
this creep definitely has a type .
both women were roughly the same age , same look .
cute brunettes are his thing .
myia collins was single . she grew up in the area
and worked at the local elementary
school as a substitute teacher .
lauren white recently moved back to diamond bar
after she and her husband split .
it says here lauren recently started
working part @-@ time as a nurse .
so both women had jobs in which it
wouldn &apos;t necessarily be noticed
if they were gone for a few days .
what about friends and family ?
lauren has a sister , heather .
myia , not so much . all her family is in ohio .
we know this guy &apos;s good at being invisible .
both women were last seen leaving
work and never made it back home .
he has to be abducting them in public .
both were technically single .
they could have been looking to meet new people .
maybe that was his in .
raymond fernandez used to place personal ads in the newspaper .
he would seduce and rob the women who answered them .
the unsub could be a lonely hearts killer .
maybe he hunts his victims at places where singles hang out .
you know , bars , night clubs , chess tournaments .
if the women turned down his advances ,
it could have emasculated him .
you rejected me . i &apos;m literally going to make you feel my pain .
but he &apos;s not breaking their hearts ,
he &apos;s breaking their bodies .
all right , when we land ,
jj , you and kate go to the m.e.
morgan , reach out to the families .
the rest of us will set up at the precinct .
agent hotchner , thanks for coming out .
detective davenport . this is agent rossi , dr. reid .
welcome . right this way .
thank you .
to be honest , this kind of thing doesn &apos;t happen around here .
this guy has the entire city on edge .
a serial killer will do that .
your team can set up in here .
thank you .
have any witnesses come forward ?
i have my guys out interviewing local merchants ,
but so far we &apos;re coming up empty .
have you noticed any variations in traffic patterns
near where the bodies were found ?
that road &apos;s a commuter nightmare .
why ?
the unsub had to know the traffic
in order to escape detection .
grand avenue &apos;s 18 miles long
and runs through 4 other cities .
he could have spread out the dump sites but chose not to .
both victims were found within a mile of one another .
that &apos;s a huge risk the unsub didn &apos;t have to take .
the area must be important to him .
or convenient . what are you willing to bet
the unsub either lives or works nearby ?
the tox screens came back negative ,
however , c.o.d. on both wasn &apos;t the lacerations to their necks
like i initially thought .
so what was it ?
blunt force trauma to the back of the head .
in fact , the lacerations were done postmortem .
the slicing of throats is a symbolic way
of silencing his victims .
maybe he feels he doesn &apos;t have a voice himself .
looks like he might have hesitated .
yeah . but the incision across lauren &apos;s throat
was much more precise .
his confidence in the way he kills
could be building with each victim .
with myia he literally beat her with his bare hands .
you can tell from the bruising here .
she suffered multiple fractures in her arms and torso .
lauren had the same type of bruising ,
but her injuries were much more brutal .
he introduced a blunt object .
brutality could be important to his fantasy .
maybe he &apos;s trying to perfect his method of torture .
or he &apos;s devolving .
maybe the torture isn &apos;t enough .
there could be something else he wants from his victims .
your sister moved back here 3 months ago .
was that to be closer to you ?
we had a falling out about a year ago .
it had only been in the last couple of months
we started patching things up .
if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,
what caused the rift in your relationship ?
when our folks split , she took it the hardest .
she felt like our dad just left .
she turned to partying .
there were times i would go days without hearing from her .
lauren recently filed for divorce .
can you tell me about her husband ?
i never even met him .
they hooked up at some bar .
she &apos;d only known him like a week
before i got a text saying they had gotten married in vegas .
and when things didn &apos;t work out for the two of them ,
she came back here .
did the divorce change her ?
she was the same lauren .
still looking for a man to validate her .
thanks , garcia .
well , lauren &apos;s ex @-@ husband doug checked out .
he &apos;s been in seattle touring with his band the past few weeks .
according to her sister , she was promiscuous .
said she would fall head over heels for any man
who showed her the slightest amount of attention .
that may rule out the lonely hearts theory .
that type of unsub typically thrives off of challenge .
lauren wouldn &apos;t have given him that .
you know what ? there might be another connection
we haven &apos;t considered .
myia was never promoted to full @-@ time
because supervisors described her as quiet and submissive .
heather said lauren struggled with
needing a man to validate her worth .
it speaks to both their levels of confidence .
this unsub could be targeting women with self @-@ image issues .
greta thomas ?
yes , that &apos;s me .
honey , i need you to stay here .
mommy will be right back .
my name is peter .
i &apos;m going to be your caseworker .
right this way .
have a seat .
can i get you something to drink ?
no , thank you .
i just need to verify a few things before we get started .
there you go .
thank you .
is this the first time you &apos;ve been here ?
my son saw it happen this time .
i never wanted him to see me like this .
how old is he ?
7 .
you two have the option of staying here ,
or if you have someplace else you &apos;d rather stay the night ...
uh , i have a friend we could stay with .
good .
now , i need you to tell me
exactly what your husband did to you .
why target women with low self @-@ esteem ?
what does it get him ?
well , it makes him easier to control .
he prolongs the torture because the more he does ,
the more powerful he feels .
which could mean he doesn &apos;t feel
very important in his everyday life .
maybe he has low self @-@ worth . like attracts like .
and his only chance of dominance
is to target other submissives .
if this is about power and control ,
maybe the stressor occurred when the unsub didn &apos;t have any ?
ok .
thank you .
these women could be surrogates for the person
he holds responsible for his pain .
something could have happened to him when he was a child .
if he felt powerless in is childhood ,
then having a taste of power now would be like a drug .
exactly .
and he &apos;ll be looking for his next fix .
i appreciate you letting us spend the night .
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to let conner sleep at that place .
no , i &apos;m fine . i just-- i just need to get out of here .
he could come back at any minute .
text you when we &apos;re on our way .
conner ?
did you pack your toothbrush ?
conner !
conner ?
didn &apos;t you hear me calling you ?
and how many times have i told you
not to go to the cabinet and get candy ?
i didn &apos;t , mom . the man gave it to me .
what man ?
that one .
her name is greta thomas .
according to the neighbor , her son conner
knocked on their door saying a man took his mom .
she looks like the other two victims .
any word on her husband ?
garcia &apos;s trying to locate him .
apparently he travels a lot for work .
did conner see anything ?
he was able to give a description ,
but not much to go on .
well , we might get more if we gave him a cognitive ,
but we &apos;re gonna need to wait and get a guardian &apos;s permission first .
this is the first time that the unsub broke into someone &apos;s house
and left a witness .
usually he just does it out in the open .
maybe he &apos;s getting closer to his ideal surrogate .
if that &apos;s the case , what makes greta different from the others ?
she &apos;s a mother .
tell me you found the husband .
affirmative , sir , but you &apos;re never gonna believe where .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a white male
in his mid- to late 30s who has a history
if physical and psychological abuse .
this unsub is a projecting punisher ,
which means he &apos;s victimizing women he believes
in one way or another haven &apos;t stood up for themselves .
with the first two victims , he caused injuries
that are consistent with domestic abuse .
with his latest victim , greta thomas ,
not only is she a mother ,
but she &apos;s an actual victim of abuse .
at her husband was jailed last night
after an altercation at the family home .
which is why we believe the unsub &apos;s mother
was the one that actually suffered physical abuse .
it &apos;s likely he blamed her for allowing the violence
to enter and continue in the home .
rather than viewing his mother as a victim ,
he holds resentment towards her
because of the upheaval and fear he lived with .
you &apos;re pathetic !
i want some respect around this house !
this house is a mess ! you &apos;re a mess !
this man doesn &apos;t hate this mother .
he hates the idea of that she represented .
hesitation marks on the earlier victims
indicate that the unsub feels conflicted by his actions .
it &apos;s possible he does not want to hurt the women he abducts ,
but somehow he feels he has to .
given his warped sense of justice ,
he may see himself as a protector of these women .
he may even want them to fight back .
he lost control at an early age ,
and he &apos;s desperate to regain it .
we should look at domestic abuse cases going back 25 to 30 years .
take a look at locations battered women frequent--
group homes , women &apos;s shelters , legal hearings .
for now our primary goal is to bring
greta thomas home alive and safe .
thank you .
you were supposed to help us .
i told you everything he did to me .
oh , my god !
where &apos;s conner ? what did you do to him ? !
he &apos;s fine , now that he &apos;s no longer in that toxic environment .
what are you talking about ?
you think this was the first time he saw that monster hit you ?
the screaming , the fighting , the arguments .
you think he &apos;s stupid ?
i can &apos;t imagine what that must do to a child .
but i made a mistake .
which you let it happen over and over again .
which is partly why i think you &apos;re perfect .
final m.e. report just came through .
take a look at the stomach contents .
saltwater , honey , ginger , and tea .
she also found multiple ulcerations
of the vocal chords of both victims ,
most likely from all the screaming .
spill it , kid . i can see you got a theory .
the saltwater could serve another purpose .
honey , ginger tea , and saltwater
are often used to treat sore throats .
maybe something about their voices is what &apos;s driving him .
but a sadist wouldn &apos;t go to such lengths to heal his victims .
especially when his final act of rage is slicing their throats .
this guy &apos;s destroying the very thing he &apos;s trying to preserve .
all the torture could simply be a means to an end .
if it &apos;s not about the violence , what &apos;s it about ?
their screams .
please !
we can &apos;t stop .
not until you give me what i want .
how the hell do you think that makes me feel , huh ?
i said i &apos;m sorry .
i bust my butt at work all day ,
and all i ask is for a hot meal .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
please , i know this is all my fault .
you think i want to do this ?
look , i know you had a rough day .
so why do you have to make it worse ?
i &apos;ll do better . i promise .
i &apos;m tired of giving you second chances .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
you guys , i have searched
every shelter up and down the west coast .
i can &apos;t find greta &apos;s name anywhere .
could she have registered anonymously ?
records are kept confidential , but trust me ,
if she was listed in any of them ,
your nearsighted wonder girl would have found her .
maybe that &apos;s the answer to where this guy finds his victims .
what if he works in the system ?
women go to him for help and end up as victims .
hey , garcia--
already on it . give me a minute .
if i find anything , i &apos;ll hit you right back .
all right , so the physical abuse he witnessed
in the household imprinted on him .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s conflicted .
he sees himself as protector and abuser .
and now he &apos;s taking on the role of the abuser
re @-@ enacting what happened to his mother .
typically , unsubs with this type of nostalgia
keep some kind of a trophy .
we haven &apos;t seen any evidence of that here .
we &apos;ve profiled that what he wants most from them
are their screams .
ok , but how is a scream a trophy ?
it &apos;s not . unless he &apos;s recording them .
i know this is all my fault .
you think i want to do this ?
look , i know you had a rough day .
why did you have to make it worse ?
i &apos;ll do better . i promise .
i &apos;m tired of giving you second chances .
hey , talk to us , hot stuff .
i feel like i don &apos;t deserve to talk to you ,
because i have terrible news .
i &apos;m hitting the hardest wall in domestic abuse cases of yesteryear .
to say there are a plethora
is a severe injustice to the word plethora .
i can &apos;t narrow it down alone . i need help .
based on the current victim pool ,
the mother would have been in her 20s back then .
thank you , thank you .
keep talking .
the unsub most likely grew up nearby , garcia .
check recurring abuse cases
within the comfort zone .
look for women who made frequent trips to the e.r.
but not for abuse . more like a freak accident ,
like falling down the stairs or extensive clumsiness .
uh @-@ huh . now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
and the occupation might match as well ,
so look for teachers or nurses .
hello , promising candidate .
karen holden , third @-@ grade teacher at the time .
she went to the e.r. multiple times ,
courtesy of her icky , icky
abusive husband frank holden .
where &apos;s frank and karen now ?
dead . like in a tragic story of
shakespearean proportions kind of way .
they died in a murder @-@ suicide 25 years ago .
what happened ?
uh , frank had a drinking problem .
he got punchy with karen , like literally ,
an argument ensued and
ended up with karen having her throat slashed
and frank with a bullet in his head .
i am guessing they had a child ?
they did , indeed .
little peter holden . he was 7 at the time .
he saw the whole thing .
do we know where peter is now ?
negatory . after his parents died ,
he was put in the foster care system until he was 18,
and that &apos;s where the paper trail ends .
diamond bar &apos;s a small town . probably changed his name
to escape the notoriety of his parents &apos; deaths .
i &apos;ll check court records and see if i can find a breadcrumb .
all right , thanks , baby girl .
wait , wait , there &apos;s a name
that keeps coming up in the old hospital records .
john folkmore . he was an officer who responded
to a majority of the calls from the holden residence .
johnny . he retired a few years back , but he still lives in town .
you think he might know what happened to the kid ?
it &apos;d be good to talk to him .
you didn &apos;t do it right .
i shouldn &apos;t have to do this .
what are you talking about ?
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
i don &apos;t . just let me go .
i promise i won &apos;t tell any--
why are you holding back ?
i did what you wanted .
no , you didn &apos;t !
do you think i want to do this ?
then don &apos;t .
please , just let me go .
i can &apos;t .
why won &apos;t you do what i ask ? !
i have .
no ! it &apos;s not right !
it &apos;s not the way it was !
do it the way i said !
it has to happen the way i explained it to you !
do it the right way !
do it !
do you remember that little guy ?
peter holden .
never forgot that face .
back in the day you responded to a number
of domestic abuse calls at the holden residence .
at least once a week .
you knew how violent frank holden was and you never arrested him .
why ?
karen covered for him .
she wrote the book on excuses .
if she wasn &apos;t telling me she fell down stairs ,
she was bumping into cabinets .
you don &apos;t know how many times
i wanted her to come forward .
part of me blames myself for what happened that night .
will you tell me about peter ?
he was a good kid .
he loved baseball .
he didn &apos;t deserve to grow up in a house like that .
when was the last time you saw him ?
a few nights before .
i stopped by the house to drop off a gift .
i bought him a cassette recorder .
that &apos;s an odd gift to give a 7 @-@ year @-@ old , don &apos;t you think ?
it wasn &apos;t a gift , was it ?
you wanted him to capture his mother &apos;s abuse .
i--i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
i was so frustrated with that whole situation .
i made a promise to the kid ,
if he could get me the recording ...
i could finally put that son of a bitch in jail .
you were the only positive male role model he ever had .
someone had to be .
i think peter changed his last name to folkmore .
the officer &apos;s last name ?
yeah . think about it . whenever peter and his mother
were in trouble , who did they call ?
folkmore . he became a surrogate father .
you are pathetic !
i cannot take this anymore !
i am so sick of you !
the house is a mess !
you are a mess !
when i come home ,
i want to be treated with some respect .
i can &apos;t even stand to look at your face anymore !
how the hell do you think it makes me feel , huh ?
i said i &apos;m sorry .
i bust my butt at work all day
and all i ask for is a hot meal .
honey , i know this is my fault .
you think i want to do this ?
i know you had a rough day at work .
so why do you have to make it worse ?
i &apos;ll do better . i promise .
i am tired of giving you second chances .
stop ! frank , please , put the knife down .
he can hear . he &apos;s in the other room .
stop ! no , frank--
mommy !
mom ?
dad ?
no !
according to child services ,
peter was in and out of foster homes .
says he carried a tape recorder with him wherever he went .
in his statement of the night when his parents died ,
he said they were arguing . maybe he recorded it .
john never mentioned peter giving him a tape .
maybe folkmore didn &apos;t know .
karen died before peter could give him the tape .
you think he would hold on to it for all those years ?
well , it &apos;s possible .
the tape would have been his last memory of his mother ,
so he kept it for himself .
something must have happened to the original recording .
there &apos;s our trigger .
he &apos;s not going to stop until he replaces what he lost .
hey , sweetness , give it to me good .
i will . peter folkmore has only existed in the system
for the last 16 years .
he works at the angel network for women
for the last 8 years .
working there allowed him to do for other women
what he couldn &apos;t do for his mother .
karen wasn &apos;t the only one making distress calls .
a month ago , peter called the fire department
regarding a small fire in his basement .
according to insurance claims , he lost a slew of , quote ,
&quot; priceless belongings . &quot;
that &apos;s right before the murders started .
do you have an address ?
work and home already sent to you .
jj and i will take the house .
we &apos;ll grab the others and go to the shelter .
where are you , greta ?
come out , come out , wherever you are .
the sooner we get this right ,
the sooner we can end this .
getting warmer ?
no ! no ! no !
yeah , you . you .
i really wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
you ruined it . we were getting somewhere .
we can try again . just please don &apos;t do this !
no !
help ! help !
come on !
scream for me .
you wish .
we need a medic down here asap .
greta .
greta , are you ok ?
conner ?
he &apos;s ok . he &apos;s safe . he &apos;s safe . i promise .
you &apos;re gonna be ok . an ambulance is on the way .
scream for me .
&quot; nothing can drive one closer to his own insanity
than a haunting memory refusing its own death . &quot;
darnella ford .
how &apos;s the head ?
oh , i &apos;ll survive .
what about you ?
i know that look .
face of a worried mom . what &apos;s going on ?
meg is going on her first date tonight .
really ?
at 13 ?
it &apos;s not really-- it &apos;s not really a date .
it &apos;s with boys .
but when i was 13 and i went to the mall
to meet boys , it was a date .
yeah . times are a @-@ changin &apos; , my friend .
i just keep reminding myself , it is just the mall .
i don &apos;t think parents are ever ready for their kids to grow up .
it feels like yesterday she was in diapers .
teenagers . i don &apos;t know how my mom survived .
ooh . mine either .
well , right now henry still thinks girls have cooties . so ...
he won &apos;t feel that way a few years from now , so treasure it .
don &apos;t you wish you could just ...
keep them innocent forever ?
yeah .
relax . we &apos;re early .
as long as we make it back before curfew , we &apos;re good .
otherwise there &apos;ll be hell to pay for .
what did you tell your folks ?
the truth . sort of .
i told them we were meeting two guys in our biology class .
this is the best study session i &apos;ve ever had .
they actually believed you ?
why wouldn &apos;t they .
i couldn &apos;t tell them we were meeting
some cute senior we met online . they &apos;d freak .
where is that cute guy ?
speaking of freaking ...
hey , girls .
what are you doing here ?
you were supposed to just drop us off , not follow us in .
it &apos;s a mall . valentine &apos;s day .
i &apos;m buying kate a gift .
ooh , what &apos;d you get her ?
oh , uh , just gloves .
in a pink bag ? those are not gloves .
so , uh , what &apos;s up with these boys from your class ?
they &apos;re running late .
ok , well ,
don &apos;t miss your curfew .
i won &apos;t . don &apos;t you trust me ?
yeah , i trust you . it &apos;s the boys i don &apos;t trust .
ok . well , i &apos;m gonna leave you guys to it .
uh , just remember , boys that run late
are not worth waiting for .
bye , chris .
bye .
bye , mr. callahan .
bye , you guys .
i can &apos;t believe it . your uncle &apos;s a total stalker .
right ? i don &apos;t know why he can &apos;t just accept
that i &apos;m not a little girl anymore . jeez .
hey , sweetie , it &apos;s me .
i , uh--look , i just want to clear the air
and let you know that i &apos;m really sorry .
we definitely should have discussed meg dating
before i gave the approval for her to do that . and ...
but if it &apos;s any consolation , i &apos;m at the mall right now ,
and i &apos;m planning on sticking around to keep an eye on them .
but , uh , they &apos;re doing great .
except for the fact they may have just been
stood up for the first time . but ...
i , uh , i love you , and i do feel bad .
so bad , as a matter of fact , that i bought you something amazing .
it &apos;s like , red , and it &apos;s got black stripes ,
and a strap .
it &apos;s gonna look so hot on you .
uh , i &apos;ll show you when you get home , ok ?
where are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
sorry .
我们回头再约吧
oh , they &apos;re not coming .
what ? why not ?
