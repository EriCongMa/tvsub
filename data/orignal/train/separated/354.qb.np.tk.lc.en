i still have the complainant on the line .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
ma &apos;am , the police are knocking on the door right now .
911 . what is your emergency ?
yes , that is a real police officer outside .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
ma &apos;am , you need to calm down and stop yelling .
yes , sir , we have a unit on the way .
please stay on the line . please give me your full name .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
there &apos;s a dead body in the warehouse .
excuse me , sir ?
there &apos;s a dead body in the warehouse in crawfordville .
can you be more specific about the location of that warehouse ?
west of crawfordville highway , south of woodland .
a dirt road .
do you have an address ?
no .
charlie 44 , role to location of possible dead body .
is someone on the way ?
yes , but i need you to stay on the line with me , sir .
are you sure the victim is dead , sir ?
he will be in a second .
excuse me ?
sir ? sir !
charlie 44 , we have shots fired now .
i repeat , shots fired . i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going on in there ,
but i no longer have contact with the complainant .
advise and use extreme caution .
this is charlie 44 . we &apos;re on scene .
it &apos;s quiet out front .
we &apos;re moving in .
10 @-@ 4 . use caution . ems is on the way , too .
eyes open , ray .
state police !
state police ! open the door !
police !
you , in the chair !
stand up and let me see your hands .
last chance , man ! stand up !
lord have mercy .
do not blow dinner , ray .
i &apos;m ok .
i mean it . you need to outside , you go .
i said i &apos;m fine .
this is charlie 44 . you can cancel that ems out here , dispatch .
are you sure , 44 ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;m sure .
this looks to be a successful suicide .
10 @-@ 4 .
what the hell ...
got a light .
oh , man , take a look at this , tommy .
these women all dead ?
doesn &apos;t say this one &apos;s every been found .
i recognize that name .
she only went missing 3 weeks ago .
this is 44 again .
uh , we &apos;re gonna need bosses , detectives ,
crime scene out here on the double .
ah , hell , just ...
send everybody .
tell me what the dress is about .
hey , have a good weekend , jj .
sorry .
there goes my beach house rental .
and my non @-@ refundable sin to win weekend
in atlantic city .
sin to win ?
yeah .
and i always win big .
i didn &apos;t have any plans .
hey , uh , these were just faxed to me .
i talked to a tallahassee detective
who &apos;s been working a missing coed--
rebecca daniels-- she went missing while jogging
near the fsu campus 3 weeks ago .
who &apos;s this ?
florida state police responded
to an apparent suicide an hour and a half ago .
middle @-@ aged male . those are photos of him postmortem .
what &apos;s with the tattoos ?
yeah , he &apos;s covered in them , almost completely .
that &apos;s why they requested our presence .
the tattoos are portraits of previously missing women ,
with the years of death or the years the remains were recovered , anyway .
the tattoos correlate to faces on a wall next to the body ,
with information on the women going back 10 years .
rebecca is also shown on that wall ,
but there &apos;s no image of her on the body .
the detective thinks that that may mean that she &apos;s alive somewhere .
he called in his own suicide , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . how did you--
he staged all this .
no reason to put on a show without an audience .
tell them to leave the body where it is .
we need to see it exactly how he wanted it seen .
if this girl &apos;s still out there ,
the only one who knows where she is may be dead .
&quot; a sincere artist tries to create something
which is in itself a living thing . &quot;
painter william dobell .
oh , this heat is brutal .
you know , it isn &apos;t so much the heat as it is the humidity .
at some point it doesn &apos;t matter how you look at it .
it all sucks .
fbi ?
yes , sir .
hi , john barton , tallahassee pd .
i &apos;m the primary on the missing girl , rebecca daniels .
i got my files in the car if you need them .
i &apos;m agent hotchner .
this is agent rossi , agent prentiss ,
dr. reid , agent morgan , agent jareau .
yeah , we spoke on the phone .
yeah , hey , thanks a lot for coming out so quickly .
i appreciate that .
i &apos;ve also confirmed that all the women
are victims from around the southeast--
florida , louisiana , georgia , alabama .
and rebecca &apos;s the only woman on the wall
who &apos;s not represented on his body ?
yeah , she &apos;s the only one .
hope you have a strong stomach .
the chair was turned like that ?
this is exactly where you found him ?
yeah .
talk about staging .
talk about ego .
there &apos;s also a couple boxes with journals
or composition books . they &apos;re filled with writing .
we haven &apos;t been through them yet other than to dust them for prints .
have you identified him ?
we &apos;re working on it .
uh , we got a rush on the dna and the prints .
he &apos;s cleared locally ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time to get the national records .
what about property records ?
talked to the owner .
she said she rented it a couple weeks ago
to a quiet , normal @-@ looking guy named bob .
he said he wanted to store some equipment ,
and he paid in cash .
they &apos;re always normal .
no lease ?
uh , month to month , no . out here in the boonies
you don &apos;t get a lot of , uh , record @-@ keeping types .
especially when it comes to cash transactions , i &apos;ll bet .
he &apos;s no kid , yet the missings go back only 10 years ?
as far as i could tell .
late bloomer .
you see this a lot , uh ,
these guys killing themselves ?
most serial killers who commit suicide
do it in prison after they &apos;re caught .
jj , gather as much information
about the prior victims as you can .
morgan and prentiss , take the journals .
dave , you and reid , the tattoos .
see if he left any clues about where miss daniels might be .
you think there &apos;s a chance she might still be alive ?
it &apos;s probably better not to speculate .
may i take a look at the case files you have on miss daniels ?
yeah , yeah , no problem .
he was on the phone with dispatch and then ,
must be what , 15 feet ?
consummate overachiever .
oh . right . right .
why is it when men kill themselves ,
it gets everywhere , but women don &apos;t leave a mess ,
like they were never there ?
women worry about who has to clean up .
men don &apos;t give a damn .
jj , what have you found ?
the earliest clipping is from 10 years ago ,
and they &apos;re in order , oldest to newest .
brenda carlyle first , rebecca daniels last .
that was thoughtful of him .
one victim a year for 10 years straight .
each girl &apos;s remains were recovered
in a well @-@ traveled wooded area .
strangled , repeatedly sexually assaulted ,
and then about a week later ,
another woman goes missing .
did the new abductions happen
before the previous body &apos;s been found ?
no , never .
so he has a year @-@ long cycle .
he uses them up and he gets a newer model .
but he won &apos;t take another girl
until the last body &apos;s been found .
he &apos;s telling a story and he can &apos;t start a new one
until the old one &apos;s over .
look at that . at the turn of the 16th century ,
rose tattoos were put on men who were sentenced to death .
really ?
yeah . if they escaped , it served to identify them .
but now roses pretty much symbolize pure love .
pure love . right before he kills them .
hey , have you read &quot; the illustrated man &quot; ?
nope .
oh , it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a collection of short stories
by ray bradbury , based on the metafictive device
of a man who &apos;s covered in tattoos drawn by a woman from the future .
at nighttime , the tattoos come to life
and tell a story . it &apos;s pretty awesome .
these do tell a story .
oh , you want to see something ?
huh . a space on the tree .
and there &apos;s no date on that one .
why would he leave that space blank ?
maybe this guy &apos;s just a psycho .
if it were that simple , we &apos;d all be out of a job .
hey , reid .
what &apos;s up ?
our man here was a prolific journaler .
with teeny tiny handwriting .
he probably had counseling at some point
when journaling was part of his therapy .
that &apos;s what we were thinking .
and ?
and , uh , well , you know , the two of us ,
it would take us like 3 days to read all of this stuff .
you guys owe me .
it &apos;s no wonder no one has ever connected these cases .
they &apos;re from different states ,
different jurisdictions .
it &apos;s probably no accident .
he knows the system .
why kill himself now ?
he wasn &apos;t on anyone &apos;s radar .
something changed .
let &apos;s gather everyone .
so what do we know so far ?
he wanted the police here .
he wanted us to see all this .
he was definitely a sadist . from what we saw ,
his journals were graphic and meticulous .
covering himself with his victims &apos; likeness
is methodical , possessive . he &apos;ll always own them .
and the suicide shows commitment .
he &apos;s organized and compulsive .
the crimes are on an annual cycle .
computer printouts on the board ,
they were all printed on the same day--
2 weeks ago .
that &apos;s when he rented this building .
and proceeded to move everything into it .
it &apos;s a history of his crimes .
so he did all of this in 2 weeks .
he got away with it for 10 years .
he could have kept going .
but he decides to end it all
and hand everything to us .
that &apos;s it--everything .
everything .
reid ?
everything . his body , the tattoos , the clippings ,
the printout , the journals . he moved it all into one room .
he wanted us to see all of it . see all of him
his work--the women , he put them in chronological order .
he &apos;s screaming , &quot; look at me . &quot;
we all got that .
no , but think about it .
if you take a step back , it sort of makes sense .
it &apos;s just a confession .
a giant , flashy confession .
what would we say if an unsub turned himself in to the police
before they were even onto him ?
that he was trying to hide something .
or someone .
he made a mistake-- in his third book .
i almost missed it , but then i caught it .
&quot; i thought it would take longer ,
but today was the lucky day .
she almost walked right by ,
almost missed her completely ,
but at the last moment ,
we found our latest guest . &quot;
we .
he has a partner .
he put everything in this room .
so we wouldn &apos;t look further ,
wouldn &apos;t dig even deeper .
if he has a partner , he &apos;s still out there ,
and he &apos;s got rebecca daniels .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i was calling out ,
but i guess your music was too loud .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s all right .
juliet monroe ?
that &apos;s me .
that &apos;s for you .
if i can get you to sign here .
thank you very much . sorry about that .
it &apos;s fine .
have a great day , now .
you , too .
&quot; my dearest love ,
by the time you read this ,
i will have gone .
our life together has brought me more joy
than a man like me thought he could ever know .
my first wish would be to take you with me .
but since you are in our home readying yourself
with the next chapter of our life--
to care for and raise our beautiful child .
my last hope is that you finish what we started .
please ...
please ... just let me go home .
this is your fault .
this is your fault .
please ...
what &apos;s she doing down there ?
she &apos;s trying to keep the media from running the story right now .
but wouldn &apos;t that help us get it out there ,
put some pressure on the partner ?
but if the partner didn &apos;t know about the suicide ,
he might dispose of miss daniels and disappear .
if anyone can stop the media from running something , it &apos;s jj .
so let &apos;s profile the partner .
we know that the unsub was a dominant personality , an alpha .
can any of you guys think of a case
where a dominant unsub committed suicide
to protect a submissive partner ?
no .
so the partner must be an equal in some way ,
or at least not a competitor ,
not somebody that he needed to feel dominance over .
maybe it was someone he cared about ?
it would be hard for a sadistic psychopath to care about anybody .
which would make the partner all that much more important to him .
what about the tattoo artist ?
he couldn &apos;t have done those by himself .
maybe that &apos;s the role for the partner .
it would certainly make him important .
what the hell does any of this have to do with becky ?
i mean , isn &apos;t there something we should be doing , damn it ?
detective , may i speak with you for a moment ?
so we have until the evening news--6 p.m.
how much do they know ?
oh , the troopers told them everything .
agent rossi , please tell me you called
because the case is over
and i can erase this freakity @-@ freak
off my otherwise uber @-@ delicious desktops .
long way to go , kid .
i am into epiderm artistry as much as the next gen xer ,
but this guy ... eesh , i &apos;m just glad
he &apos;s not breathing the same air as you ,
my fine furry friends .
agreed . what have you found out about tattoo artists down here ?
that the state of florida
requires licensing for all skin illustrators ,
but--and i am not going to elaborate on how i know this--
not everyone in the body art lifestyle goes through official channels .
all right , we &apos;ll start with the legit ones
and see if anyone recognizes the work .
i shall send the list to your pda .
thanks .
epiderm artistry ?
... what is happening . she will get ...
only a girl can fill that empty energy .
starting to get angry .
i approach her door ...
look , i &apos;m sorry i popped off .
i &apos;m just a little worked up .
i &apos;ve been over the rebecca daniels case file , your reports .
do you know her ?
what ?
is there a personal relationship ?
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
you &apos;ve referred to her twice as becky .
i did ?
and nowhere else is she referred to that way .
it &apos;s always rebecca .
now , if there &apos;s something that &apos;s gonna cloud your judgment ,
i need to know about it .
no . i don &apos;t know her .
then what is it ?
look , i &apos;ve ...
i &apos;ve been doing this a long time , and ...
it usually just washes right over me , you know ,
people killing people , depravity .
as long as you make it home at night , right ?
but this one ...
her parents ...
they &apos;re just such good , decent people .
she seems like an amazing girl , and ...
it &apos;s all ...
sometimes it &apos;s just too much .
you take it personal .
stupid , right ?
caring about a victim , personalizing them ,
can only be stupid if it &apos;s reckless .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;m good .
all right . let &apos;s go and try to bring her home .
it &apos;s like 110 out here .
and it feels like a refrigerator
compared to their warehouse .
how &apos;s reid doing ?
it doesn &apos;t even seem to faze him .
he &apos;s just sitting there in a corner turning pages .
yeah , he goes to another place when he reads .
i &apos;ve got the addresses of the major tattoo parlors
in tallahassee .
that work is pretty detailed .
someone might recognize it .
you want to go check these out with me ?
sounds fun .
hey , so , uh , i got a few more hours out of the media .
well , we &apos;ll take what we can get .
prentiss and rossi are going to check out some tattoo parlors .
is he ok ?
yeah .
did you ask him about calling her becky ?
he &apos;ll be all right .
well , i hope so .
because we still have no indication
that this girl &apos;s even alive .
i wasn &apos;t able to tie up all the loose ends .
you would have known what was happening .
so now it &apos;s left for you .
wait for night and take it to the water .
the animals will do the rest .
this guy killed all those women ?
looks like it .
and there &apos;s another one missing .
then he killed himself ?
yeah , he did .
good . sort of a public service .
hmm . i guess that &apos;s a good way of looking at it .
we send it to the m.e. &apos; s office in tallahassee .
you sign it ?
i &apos;ll take care of that , later . thanks .
thanks a lot .
you sure it &apos;s ok to move the body ?
well , there &apos;s no reason not to anymore .
we &apos;ve seen this guy &apos;s show .
have you ever seen anything like this before ?
like what ?
everything . the , uh , suicide ,
the clippings , the journal .
i think it &apos;s pretty safe to say
that no one &apos;s ever seen anything like this .
man , this is beautiful work .
it &apos;s a body suit ?
he &apos;s completely covered ?
pretty much .
yeah . &quot; the illustrated man . &quot;
second time i &apos;ve heard that today .
the book ?
reid mentioned it .
everybody in the body art world knows that story .
you said this dude killed himself ?
did he , like , gash his wrists open or something ?
the tattoos--could you recognize who did this ?
i wish . i &apos;d hire this dude in a heartbeat .
this looks free @-@ hand .
trust me , free @-@ hand portraiture is pretty gnarly
to do on skin , man .
did he shoot himself ?
because none of these pictures have a head .
can you tell if the same artist did these ?
it looks like it .
but they weren &apos;t all done at the same time .
some of the inks are newer .
you know , if i saw the body ,
i &apos;d probably be able to tell you more .
how about these ?
these are a lot of portraits . what do they mean ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
wait .
that doesn &apos;t fit .
what doesn &apos;t ?
there &apos;s something under the rose there .
looks like ... a cross ?
a big one .
where ?
inside the rose .
and the work is sloppy .
see that ? they put the rose over it to cover it up .
yeah , i see that .
yeah , that wasn &apos;t done professionally .
more like it was done in jail .
if he did time ,
that would explain how a 50 @-@ year @-@ old unsub
doesn &apos;t start killing until he &apos;s 40 .
this dude &apos;s a killer ?
and why rapists become killers after they &apos;ve been in prison .
they learn not to leave a witness .
garcia can track this through
the biometric recognition program .
so , there &apos;s , like , no chance of me seeing the dead dude , right ?
none .
hey , p.g. , i &apos;m gonna send you a photograph of a tattoo .
you know , that empty space
on his back makes him exactly like &quot; the illustrated man . &quot;
i thought he was covered completely .
in the book .
in the movie , there &apos;s an open spot on his back ,
so you can see the future .
rossi and prentiss think he may have done time
and that one of the tattoos may have been done in prison .
that &apos;s a good bet .
i &apos;ve got garcia running everything
through the biometrics database .
biometrics ?
yeah , it catalogues all the prison inmates and their tattoos .
they have detailed photos of every one on every inmate .
what happened ?
shut up .
please , sit down .
you can tell me .
we can sit down and--
we can talk about this . we could--
wait ! please ...
can we please talk ?
my dad has to be so worried about me .
don &apos;t you have a father ?
i don &apos;t have anyone anymore .
please ... just let me go
before he comes back .
he &apos;s not coming back .
what ?
wait .
you can let me go .
what ?
it &apos;s just--
i won &apos;t tell anyone what happened .
i promise i won &apos;t tell anyone .
you won &apos;t tell anyone ?
i--
i know you &apos;re afraid of him , too .
you &apos;re not going to tell anyone
because you &apos;re never leaving this room alive .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry ...
i was never afraid of him .
i loved him .
i would do anything , i did anything for him .
he was my masterpiece .
i ...
oh , no .
you &apos;re bleeding !
i &apos;ll be able to fill in the last space in my art collection .
the last space ... last space ... last space ...
no , no , no , that &apos;s not right .
hey , guys , it isn &apos;t the only blank space .
what do you mean ?
the spot on his chest where we assumed
rebecca &apos;s portrait would go--
yeah ?
in the journal he talks about filling in the last space ,
how once he does that the artwork will be complete .
and ?
it isn &apos;t the only blank space .
in his back , in the middle of that tree
is a giant open spot . why would he talk about completing the artwork
when he hasn &apos;t ?
i need to see the body again .
i &apos;ll go with you .
i &apos;ll call the m.e. and let him know you &apos;re on your way .
garcia ?
i ran the covered tattoo through the morpho tracking system .
tell me you got something , babe .
emily , don &apos;t get ahead of my dramatic telling .
i analyzed color , design , and texture .
there &apos;s a 95 % chance it is from one of 4 major institutions
in the northeastern prison system .
the string of missings began unbroken from 2000,
so i went back from that year ,
found 53 similar tattoos on forearms .
of those 53 , 10 were released
prior to 2000 . thank you and good night .
you are amazing .
of the 10 , any convicted rapists ?
4 .
do any of them trace back to tallahassee ?
none .
so ultimately i have nada .
bob .
oh , the guy , his name , the guy who rented the property ,
just bob .
ok , ok .
i have a robert matthew burke ,
convicted in 1991 , 8 years for rape ,
released october of &apos; 99 .
and the missings began in 2000 .
garcia , remind me never to try to hide from you .
perish the thought , mon ami .
hotch , we got the name .
the unsub &apos;s name is robert matthew burke .
burke ?
you know him ?
burke . yeah .
i know the name .
damn it !
he &apos;s a registered sex offender .
he &apos;s an ex @-@ con out of virginia .
he got a traffic ticket near fsu
the night rebecca disappeared .
he &apos;s one of my suspects .
i--i went to his apartment , i don &apos;t know , a couple times
in the past 3 weeks to try to interview him ,
but i could never catch up with him .
did he know you were looking for him ?
well , yeah , i talked to him on the phone .
he &apos;s scheduled to come down for an interview and a dna swab on monday .
that &apos;s what changed .
he knew it was only a matter of time before you caught up to him .
and he wasn &apos;t about to go back to prison .
do you have his address ?
yeah .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
something &apos;s wrong . something &apos;s wrong .
unchain me .
unchain me and i will help you .
i am not stupid .
your baby needs help .
wait ! you can &apos;t--
the collar .
you help me and i &apos;ll let you go .
ok .
ok . ok .
fbi !
damn it .
if these tattoos are a fetish ,
what enjoyment does he get out of the ones on his back ?
he can &apos;t even see them .
you know what ? there &apos;s something here .
i can feel the raised ink .
do you have a black light scanner ?
thanks .
right there . feel that .
yeah , what is that ?
thanks .
i &apos;ve read about this . tattoos put on with invisible ink
so that no one can see them .
oh , man .
can you , uh , turn the lights down ? thanks .
look , there &apos;s one over here , too .
they &apos;re all connected to the faces .
they lead to the blank spot .
ow , wow . what is that ?
it &apos;s an embryo in a womb .
the partner &apos;s a woman , and they &apos;re having a baby .
oh , my god !
there &apos;s more blood . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
it ... it won &apos;t stop .
it won &apos;t stop . i don &apos;t know what to do !
it won &apos;t stop . i don &apos;t--
help me .
do we know if she had the baby yet ?
the tattoos have dates , the embryo doesn &apos;t .
dating is prominent in the tattoos and the journals
and they &apos;re calendrical in their abductions .
it &apos;s hard to believe their baby &apos;s birthdate
wouldn &apos;t be exceedingly important to them .
then she &apos;s probably still pregnant .
well , he didn &apos;t live here with a pregnant woman .
this is a males @-@ only sro .
no , she has to have a house , anyway .
how do you know that ?
they kept these women for a year each .
it wasn &apos;t in a one @-@ room apartment .
everyone get back here . we need to update the profile
and narrow the search .
push . push .
push ! push !
it &apos;s almost--
it &apos;s almost there . just keep pushing .
i see the head !
i can &apos;t .
one more time , that &apos;s it !
hi .
please ...
tell me it &apos;s a girl .
what ?
it can &apos;t be a boy .
please .
it--
you have a son .
it can &apos;t be a boy .
it can &apos;t be a boy .
get it away from me .
you need to take him .
i don &apos;t want it .
he &apos;ll hurt me like they all do .
i felt for sure i was having a girl .
no , no , no !
you gotta get me out of here .
you have to get me out of here !
help us !
help us !
i know .
you &apos;re a sweetheart .
it &apos;s ok .
the partner being pregnant can help us .
we should have garcia try and find her
through doctor visits or medical records .
he basically lived off the grid ,
which means she did , too .
judging by the photographs of what they did to the victims ,
it &apos;s safe to say they live in isolation .
we &apos;ve seen his hatred for women , and yet he teams up with her .
what kind of woman could change him ?
you think they met in prison ?
garcia already went through all of that .
he had no female visitors .
what about prison staff , doctors , religious volunteers ?
we went through a long list of all the vendors
who were there during his incarceration .
none of them resurfaced in tallahassee .
what kind of a woman would go to a prison
to fall in love with a rapist ?
someone vulnerable , emotionally fragile , drawn to violent men .
someone in her life made her that way . classic abuse cycle .
what if that &apos;s who she was there to visit ?
it &apos;s worth a try .
my sweet .
hey , you know the visitor logs from the prison we looked at ?
still have them at the ready .
ok , great . i need you to check dates for me .
were there any women who visited another inmate while burke was there
but then suddenly stopped visiting when burke was released ?
huh . ok , let me hit you back .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
i can &apos;t help you !
it &apos;s ok ...
rev your engines , guys .
juliet monroe went to visit her father in prison
once or twice a year from &apos; 92 to &apos; 95 .
what was he in for ?
rape . and she was his primary victim .
he raped her and she still went to visit him every year ?
she &apos;s repeating the cycle she grew up with .
yeah . and she went from visiting him once or twice a year
to once a month from &apos; 95 to &apos; 97 .
when burke was serving his time for rape .
yeah . and then she increased her visits to once a week
all through &apos; 98 and &apos; 99 , until they stopped completely
in october of that year .
that &apos;s when he was released .

it would have been an easy thing to miss a routine traffic ticket
in the area she disappeared .
you kept the pressure on .
you cleared 9 homicides and you brought becky home .
it &apos;s impressive work , detective .
thanks .
3 cards , please .
3 cards for the lady .
and i &apos;m gonna take one card .
ooh . one card .
a straight or a flush , dr. reid , what are you trying to fill in ?
well , considering the odds of filling in an open @-@ ended straight
with one card are 5 @-@ to @-@ 1 against , while a one @-@ card flush draw
is more like 4.5 @-@ to @-@ 1 , i guess you &apos;d say if i was smart ,
i &apos;m drawing to a flush .
i think i &apos;m gonna go all in on this .
so , are you ?
am i drawing to a flush , or am i smart ?
either . - well , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m provably a genius ,
but , uh , actually , i was drawing to a full house .
8s over 6s .
i always forget you &apos;re from vegas .
yup .
ooh , i &apos;m sorry , not so fast .
i , too , have a boat .
jacks over 3s .
you drew 3 cards to a full house ?
that &apos;s like 100 @-@ to @-@ 1 against .
97 @-@ to @-@ 1 .
looks like you &apos;re out .
hey , prentiss .
sin to win .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
come on , now , i gotta know .
what the hell is a sin to win weekend in atlantic city ?
derek , i have a tremendous amount of respect for you ,
but there &apos;s some questions that if you have to ask them ,
it means you probably couldn &apos;t handle the answer .
there is a whole other side to that woman .
i never lose .
a whole other side .
i know environment plays a bigger role than genetics
when it comes to determining a child &apos;s future ,
but that baby , i mean , both the parents .
how many other serial killers had kids ?
a lot . manson has like 10 or 11 children .
albert fish had 6 .
gary ridgeway had a son .
fred and rosemary west had 7 children living in the home
where they killed 10 women .
including one of the children .
ok , so , the baby &apos;s gonna be ok ?
most likely . if he grows up in a good home .
loved , cared for .
good .
gandhi said ,
&quot; i have seen children successfully surmount the effects
of an evil inheritance .
that is due to purity being an inherent attribute
