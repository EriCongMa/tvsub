第五季第十二集
so according to the demonologist ,
the gymnasium is clean .
jeez , we &apos;re running out of to @-@ do stars .
already dealt with .
it &apos;s hard to believe .
somewhere along the way ,
we started turning this school around .
what the hell was that ?
what was what ?
that long , quiet lull . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s called contentment , dude .
exactly . we &apos;re never content .
someone &apos;s always got to have a problem .
i &apos;ve got a problem .
i don &apos;t like abed &apos;s problem with our lack of problems .
okay .
i commented on his commentary .
i just drew a circle around abed , baby .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s nice to pigeonhole people &apos;s gimmicks .
you hear me , two voice ?
abed , let us have a moment of peace and stillness .
they &apos;re kind of rare around here .
all i &apos;m saying is , calm before the storm .
says the storm generator .
all right , fine . let &apos;s be content .
attention , students and faculty of greendale .
i pressed this button on accident
but might as well check in .
how are you ?
fine .
aw , that &apos;s nice . i &apos;m good too .
i love you guys .
we love you too .
the information you have requested ...
is on the internet .
school board , baby .
school board guys coming in .
i would appreciate some knocking .
do you know what goes on in here ?
just a heads @-@ up .
there &apos;s an insurance appraiser coming tomorrow .
your ass is getting appraised insurance @-@ style .
what does that mean ?
we hope it means we find out
that your school is very , very valuable to the city .
hey , how hilarious would that be ?
are you guys drunk ?
good luck proving it before we &apos;re not .
strawberry .
too ripe .
you guys have been doing this for 30 minutes .
so what ?
i made all the vegetables disappear .
usually , a lot more than this happens in 30 minutes
is all i &apos;m saying .
we &apos;re just relaxed and happy .
i care more about this than anything i &apos;ve ever cared about .
best $ 199 i &apos;ve ever spent .
it &apos;s $ 3 .
what are you playing ?
that &apos;s control software for some kind of irrigation equipment .
it &apos;s fun .
save greendale committee , unite .
boom .
an insurance appraiser is coming tomorrow
to inspect the school ,
and if he doesn &apos;t appraise us good ,
the school is doomed , doomed .
call to adventure . call to adventure .
what &apos;s an insurance appraiser ?
something that sounds normal and boring
but is actually scary , like a raised mole
or a turkey deep fryer .
there &apos;s only one man qualified to appraise insurance ,
and he died 2,000 years ago on a cross .
i &apos;ve seen insurance appraisers bleed .
their blood &apos;s different , darker .
everyone , take a breath .
you &apos;re overreacting because this school is addicted to crisis .
they &apos;re like one of those hurricane katrina dogs
that won &apos;t let anyone pet them anymore .
but the weird thing we need to get used to is this :
the school &apos;s in decent shape .
this doesn &apos;t have to be a big deal .
i wrote a paper on those dogs .
we &apos;ve worked hard all semester to save this school .
truth is , we did .
so relax .
are you sure , jeffrey ?
i promise .
jeff &apos;s heart is in the right place , but he &apos;s wrong .
greendale is a crazy place where crazy things happen .
i have a plan .
we &apos;ll pretend our school has a world @-@ renowned physics department .
dean , start learning swedish .
i &apos;ll do my best !
hickey , do you keep in touch with
any unstable criminals that you busted ?
five .
get them down here for costume measurements .
annie , we need to make a particle accelerator
out of kleenex boxes .
nope . nobody do any of that .
abed , outside .
there is no story .
everything &apos;s a story , jeff .
getting out of bed is a story . certainly this is a story .
i mean , start with the study room .
we &apos;re content . i &apos;m concerned .
skip the fruit @-@ matching stuff .
dean enters with the insurance appraiser story ,
call , refusal .
you &apos;re literally dragging me across a threshold demanding
there be no story , which puts me into a whole new world
that i &apos;m gonna have to adapt to .
well , you have to do it by yourself , please .
okay ?
because if this appraisal is a story ,
that means we &apos;re in trouble , and we are not in trouble ,
because if we are ...
no more stories .
so we &apos;ll see you later .
after no story .
no story .
so be it .
let the lack of story ...
oh , put one trap behind each cabinet .
although i think we &apos;re good .
the cafeteria food killed most of the roaches anyway .
hey , check it out .
is this a wedding ring ?
are you kidding ?
what ...
i lost this my first week here .
oh , who &apos;s the lucky ...
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s .
i started wearing it because--i don &apos;t know .
everybody dreams of settling down , right ?
and because it fits .
she had huge fingers for a woman ,
part of what killed her , really .
i &apos;m not dreaming about settling down .
well , maybe you already have .
you &apos;re teaching , and you like it .
you love greendale .
no , i love scotch and myself .
i tolerate greendale .
it &apos;s a good school .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s no need for this to get sentimental .
this inspection is going to be the most boring thing
to happen here since britta dated troy .
all right , no story .
wait .
if there &apos;s no story , what am i explaining ?
i &apos;m in a story .
okay , think , abed , think .
how do you shake a story ?
the answer
is in the teacher &apos;s lounge .
here he comes , here he comes .
okay .
hi , there . my name is ronald mohammed .
go ahead . i &apos;ve heard them all .
the city of greendale has sent me here
to assess this campus &apos; level of liability .
now , what do i mean by liability ?
well , the city defines liability
as any asserted or non @-@ asserted perturbation
by any qualifying party .
what &apos;s a party ?
a party is a person or a group of persons
or an event celebrating a person or a party of persons&apos;
birth , marriage ...
don &apos;t panic , jeffrey .
hmm ? i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m the only one who &apos;s not panicking .
oh , please .
you can lie to yourself , but don &apos;t lie to me .
but the city defines a dog as any living entity
with four legs and a tail ,
so raccoons , bears , mountain lions , mice--
these are all just different sizes of dog .
what do i mean by &quot; size &quot; ?
i &apos;ll tell you a story .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i know how much you feel for the campus , jeff .
i know how much you feel in general .
and i know you think it &apos;s a weakness ,
but believe me , it &apos;s your strength .
you got something in your teeth .
mm @-@ hmm , you got something in your chest .
400,000 gallons of liquefied horse meat .
here i come .
just ...
&quot; and you shall find that salt is the taste
&quot; of another man &apos;s bread ,
and hard is the way up and down another man &apos;s stairs . &quot;
dante .
let &apos;s proceed .
no !
it &apos;s always a story .
everything is a story .
wait . wait . wait . story feeds on conflict .
if i stop resisting , it &apos;ll stop being a story .
no , abed .
me with a beard ?
keep fighting the story .
keep fighting it until it falls apart .
i &apos;m right .
i mean i &apos;m wrong .
i mean i &apos;m right . i mean i &apos;m wrong .
i mean i &apos;m right . i mean i &apos;m wrong .
i mean i &apos;m right . i mean i &apos;m wrong .
unsubscribe .
for the final stage of my appraisal ,
i am going to randomly select one of your vending machines
to see if it can be rocked using human strength
enough to tip and crush me .
now , in the u.s. , each year , six people die this way ,
and five of them are insurance appraisers ,
so i take this very seriously . here we go .
okay .
sorry we &apos;re late .
hey , look . it &apos;s ronald mohammed .
how about that name ?
all right , ronald , what &apos;s the damage ?
how much is this scampy , little hole in the earth
gonna cost us this year ?
well , your gas leak is repaired ,
all your fire exits actually lead outside ,
and i am told that no new species
have been discovered here in a week .
i have to say , i was brought in here to estimate
greendale &apos;s liability , but at this point in time ,
i &apos;d describe this campus as an actual property asset .
this property has value .
best news ever !
this property has value .
it has value .
that means we can sell it !
we can finally sell it !
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
press &quot; stop &quot; on dave matthews .
what did you just say ?
we can start courting businesses to unload this school
on the private sector .
what do you mean &quot; unload it &quot; ?
this is a huge chunk of real estate ,
which generates no tax revenue
and takes money from the education budget .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s a community college .
well , excuse us for taking longer
to see that was the problem .
maybe we &apos;re not as smart as you .
i mean , we only went to yale .
oh , no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did .
oh , hey , we should call t.j. maxx right away .
dude , i told you . this jacket looks fine .
no , to talk about selling this place .
oh , right . yeah , t.j.maxx , marshalls .
what about ben &amp; jerry &apos;s ?
oh , richie , you &apos;re my friend ,
but that is the last thing you need .
tough love received , bro .
i did it . this school is story @-@ free .
we can be content now forever .
let me be one of the six this year .
craig--craig , this vending machine is not gonna
tip over and crush you .
why not ? why ?
because we fixed it when we saved greendale .
we saved greendale .
and now they &apos;re gonna sell it .
if i come over there ,
there are gonna be two sounds :
me hitting you twice .
hello , greendale , as you know ,
our school will soon be replaced by a sandwich university .
however , every ending is also a beginning .
sure , things may look bad now .
some of us may have no idea where we &apos;re going or what to do .
but ...
okay , okay , i should have written this out .
i thought i &apos;d be able to come up with something on the fly .
moving on to phase two :
the actual saving of greendale .
annie--
i &apos;ve generated a few ideas involving social media
that i think might do the trick .
annie--
you want us to tweet &quot; savegreendale &quot; ?
i &apos;m sorry , annie .
the reason i have 48 followers is that i don &apos;t exploit them .
they come to me for atheistic rants and photos
of my meals , not this obnoxiousness .
we need to make people aware that greendale exists
and needs help .
why ?
because once the internet knows about something ,
it changes .
right . just ask chris brown or china .
jeff , you made annie cry .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation ,
this is the last time that will ever happen .
i know how to save greendale .
treasure . buried treasure .
okay , i &apos;m tapped .
we all wish we could do something , annie ,
but i think that concludes the last meeting
of the save greendale committee ,
the committee that did its darnedest .
wait .
are we sure we can &apos;t stop the school
from being sold to subway ?
i &apos;m afraid so , chang .
okay , i just wanted to make sure .
ha @-@ ha , screw you guys .
it &apos;s time to get paid .
* $ 5 *
* $ 5 footlong *
* any , any , any , 5 *
* $ 5 footlong *
* any , any , any , 5 *
chang just unexpectedly betrayed the group
for the last time .
greendale is going to make
a great subway sandwich university .
you know , research shows most of your graduates end up
working for our restaurants anyway .
that &apos;s by design . we &apos;re very proud of our school .
proud of subway &apos;s school . this campus is yours now .
if you want to dynamite it ,
all we ask is that you let us light the fuse .
yeah , we hate this place .
you just said you were proud of it .
oh , proud of its potential .
love its potential .
this will be your office .
why ?
okay , we &apos;ll check in on that later .
what &apos;s the matter , guys ?
can &apos;t wait until greendale &apos;s corpse is cold
before you put it on a 6 @-@ inch white bun ?
young lady , that &apos;s not fair .
subway doesn &apos;t call its bread &quot; buns , &quot;
and we don &apos;t serve white .
we serve italian , honey oat , nine @-@ grain wheat .
great , thanks for making my joke accurate .
now it &apos;s hilarious .
classes are over , kids .
we &apos;re helping the dean pack .
this is still greendale for two hours .
enjoy it .
wait .
you don &apos;t call your bread &quot; buns . &quot;
what do you call them ?
bread .
well , bread is a substance .
what do you call the units of bread you use , &quot; breads &quot; ?
you okay ?
i just wish we had more time .
i could turn things around . i swear .
look , i got one of these label things .
it makes custom labels .
this was gonna help me get organized .
where should we start ?
should we pack up these pictures ?
they &apos;re not really mine .
they &apos;re greendale history .
here &apos;s our 1987 civil rights march .
this was when we started offering photoshop classes .
and that &apos;s russell borchert .
&quot; borchert , borchert , loved computers &quot;
yes , yes , &quot; more than women &apos;s butts or hooters . &quot;
very mature , you two .
was there any truth to that legend ?
the legend that a greendale computer professor
made love to a computer
and died of the first computer virus ?
sure . the truth is , greendale had a computer professor .
by the way , he was a millionaire and a genius .
he has sex with one computer , and that &apos;s his legacy ?
so after all my work , how will i be remembered ?
the bald dean with glasses , i guess .
are you aware there &apos;s an engraved plate on this frame
that says &quot; the truth is behind this picture &quot; ?
of course i &apos;m aware , abed . i &apos;m not an idiot .
whoa , wait .
it meant literally ?
what is it ?
i understand you were teaching fundamentals of law here .
yeah .
think you could make the transition
to teaching sandwich law ?
it &apos;s essentially the same , i &apos;m sure ,
just a bit more focused .
here .
that &apos;s a subway black card .
it entitles you to $ 5 footlongs for life .
for life , mr. winger , for life .
so ... what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m gonna transfer to city college ,
but i &apos;m knowing i &apos;m gonna be a bartender .
you ?
subway offered me a job .
nice .
i &apos;m worried about abed and annie .
they &apos;re not ready for this to end .
yeah , they &apos;re part of the adulthood @-@ begins @-@ at @-@ 30 generation .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m actually looking forward to a little bit of--
sanity ?
yes , sanity .
yeah , i mean , it &apos;s over , but on the other hand ,
it &apos;s over .
amen .
and to think this all started because you wanted to--
nail you .
yeah , i regret nothing .
don &apos;t .
i mean , after everything that has happened here ,
what did either of us really get done aside from each other ?
exactly , and what are either of us gonna be leaving with ?
um , i should go clean out my locker ,
she said at the age of 33 .
let &apos;s get married .
what ?
yeah , right ?
i mean , this is what matters , isn &apos;t it ?
this is what keeps this all from being pointless .
let &apos;s do what people do .
let &apos;s get a house we can &apos;t afford
and a dog that makes us angry .
and dedicate an entire cabinet to grocery bags
and realize we have a favorite brand of olive oil ?
yes , marry me .
okay , yeah .
yeah--uh , yeah , this feels right .
let &apos;s get out of here and never look back .
yeah , but first , let &apos;s lock these doors
and pull these shades .
we &apos;ve never had sex on the new table .
yes , two for two .
medium roughness , high tempo ?
let &apos;s make it a number eight .
buried treasure !
buried treasure !
lock the doors . close the blinds .
we could save greendale , jeff .
there may be treasure on campus .
hidden , buried treasure .
treasure !
we need to call an emergency meeting
somewhere safe where no one can hear or see ,
because we have to keep this a secret ,
because it &apos;s a buried ...
treasure !
buried treasure !
interesting .
emergency meeting .
and that &apos;s how i ended up at greendale .
isn &apos;t it strange how it took this school shutting down
for you and i to finally get to know each other ?
so what &apos;s up next for you ?
don &apos;t know , maybe go stay with family in lincolnshire .
lincolnshire ?
yeah .
where in lincolnshire ?
just a little town called scunthorpe .
scunthorpe ?
i was stationed around scunthorpe .
no .
oh , wait , wait .
* o &apos;er the lady &apos;s smocks i tarry *
* through the hollyhocks and glen *
* for a piss and a thrush in scunthorpe *
* then it &apos;s off to henningpen *
i love that .
oh , where in god &apos;s name did you learn that song ?
stainsbury pub .
my family practically lived in stainsbury &apos;s .
i lost my virginity at stainsbury &apos;s .
my mother was a stainsbury whore .
mine was missing a thumb .
oh , my god .
two thumbs , yeah , she got both. two thumbs .
i mean , you may have slept with my aunt ,
but given the circumstances , cheers .
cheers , yeah .
yeah .
mm , so you &apos;re gonna stay with your family
till you get your bearings ?
i &apos;ve got a cousin , clive , who &apos;s got a spare room .
you and he would really get along , actually .
really ?
yeah .
