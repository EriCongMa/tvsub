for over a century
i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk but i had no choice .
i have to know her .
i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
i know . we have history together .
last spring my parents &apos;car
drove off of a bridge into the lake .
you won &apos;t be sad forever , elena .
i live with my uncle .
any siblings ?
none that i talk to .
hello brother .
damon .
elena . she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
wherever you go people die .
my god . it &apos;s vicki !
something bit her . she &apos;s losing a lot of blood .
somebody help !
vampire .
don &apos;t you crave a little ?
stop .
let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s just go straight for elena .
imagine what her blood tastes like !
stop !
stay away from elena .
i &apos;ll take that as an invitation .
hey . did you hear that ?
hear what ?
i heard thunder .
there &apos;s no thunder .
are you sure ?
because if it rains
then we won &apos;t be able to see the comet .
it &apos;s not gonna rain .
listen . i ...
got you a little something .
it &apos;s back in the car .
don &apos;t you move .

dear diary
this morning is ... different .
there is change . i can sense it
feel it .
i &apos;m awake .
for the first time in a long time
i feel completely and undeniably wide awake .
for once i don &apos;t regret the day before it begins .
i welcome the day ...
because i know ...
i will see her again .
i will see him again .
for the first time in a long time
i feel good .
do i look adult ?
as in respectfully parental ?
depends where you &apos;re going .
jeremy &apos;s parent @-@ teacher conference .
hair up or down ?
sexy stewardess .
boozy housewife .
up it is .
you &apos;re feisty today .
i feel good which is rare .
so i &apos;ve decided to go with it .
fly free , walk on sunshine and all that stuff .
where is jeremy ?
he left early .
something about getting to wood shop early
to finish a birdhouse .
there is no wood shop , is there ?
no .
yeah .
you can &apos;t be in here . hon. visiting hours
don &apos;t start till 9 : 00 .
i just ...
how is she ?
she &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
yeah . but she &apos;s gonna be ok , right ?
she needs her rest .
so you come back later .
come on .
originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago
it hasn &apos;t been over mystic falls in over 145 years .
now the comet will be its brightest
right after dusk
during tomorrow &apos;s celebration .
are we bothering you mr. salvatore ?
ms. gilbert ?
i brought it .
told you .
wuthering heights by ellis bell .
you know i can &apos;t believe she didn &apos;t use her real name .
all the bronte sisters used pseudonyms .
it was the time .
female writers weren &apos;t very accepted then .
where did you get it ?
uh ... it was passed down .
through the family .
i have lots of books . go ahead . keep it .
oh , no . i ...
but i would like to read it again .
i promise i &apos;ll give it back .
ok .
i &apos;m confused .
are you psychic or clairvoyant ?
technically gran says i &apos;m a witch .
my ancestors were these really cool
salem witch chicks or something .
gran tried to explain it all
but she was looped on the liquor
so i kinda tuned out . crazy family ? yes .
witches ? i don &apos;t think so .
yeah . well . feel free to conjure up the name and number
of that guy from last night .
i didn &apos;t see him . you did .
why didn &apos;t you just talk to him ?
i don &apos;t know . i was drunk .
hey , tyler . hey , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i was just wondering how vickie &apos;s doing
since you guys are so close .
is she ok ?
she &apos;s fine . now get out of here .
how bad is she ?
do they know what attacked her ?
is she going to make a full recovery ?
was she happy to see you ?
what room number was she in ?
i &apos;m going to kick your ass .
yeah , you keep saying that
but when are you actually going to do it ?
&apos;cause i vote for right here and right now .
walk away , gilbert .
it &apos;s your final warning .
no , this is your final warning , dick .
i &apos;m sick of watching you play vickie .
you hurt her one more time .
i swear to god . i will kill you .
damn , that was like a death threat .
did you hear that ?
they &apos;re keeping her overnight to make sure
there &apos;s no infection
but she should be able to come home tomorrow .
that &apos;s good news .
did you get in touch with your mom ?
called and left a message .
she &apos;s in virginia beach with her boyfriend
so ... we &apos;ll see how long it takes
her to come rushing home .
vickie &apos;s lucky that she &apos;s ok .
i know , and now there &apos;s talk of some missing campers .
did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her ?
she said it was a vampire .
what ?
yeah , she wakes up last night and mutters &quot; vampire &quot;
and then passes out .
ok , that is weird .
i think she was drunk .
so what &apos;s up with you and the new guy ?
matt , the last thing that i want to do is hurt you .
you know , i &apos;m actually gonna go back to the hospital .
i want to be there when vickie wakes up
get the real story about last night .
ok .
as jeremy &apos;s teacher i &apos;m concerned .
it &apos;s the third day of school
and he &apos;s skipped 6 of his classes .
mr. tanner
are you aware that jeremy and elena &apos;s parents died ?
4 months ago , a great loss .
car accident .
wickery bridge if i remember correctly .
and you &apos;re related to the family how ?
the , uh , mother &apos;s kid sister ?
younger sister .
6 classes ? are you sure ?
i mean that &apos;s kind of hard to do .
not when you &apos;re on drugs .
it &apos;s his attempt at coping . ms. summers .
and the signs are there .
he &apos;s moody , withdrawn , argumentative
hungover .
are there any other relatives in the picture ?
i &apos;m their sole guardian .
could there be ?
what are you suggesting exactly ?
it &apos;s an impossible job , isn &apos;t it ?
raising two teens ?
it &apos;s been tough
but , no , it &apos;s not .
wrong answer .
it is an extremely impossible job
and anything less and you &apos;re not doing it properly .
vick .
vickie
vick , it &apos;s matt . what &apos;s wrong ?
no ! no !
get off !
no !
no !
no !
nurse
it was an animal that attacked you .
it came out of the night and jumped you .
you blacked out .
it &apos;s all you remember .
it &apos;s all i remember .
an animal attacked you . you blacked out .
it &apos;s all you remember .
it &apos;s all i remember .
nurse ! i need help !
it &apos;s my sister .
she seems fine .
well , i was talking to grams
and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom .
the last time it passed over mystic falls
there was lots of death . so much blood and carnage
it created a bed of paranormal activity .
yeah , and then you poured grams another shot
and she told you about the aliens .
so then what ?
so then nothing .
you and stefan talked all night ?
there was no sloppy first kiss
or touchy feely of any kind ?
nope .
we didn &apos;t go there .
not even a handshake ?
i mean , elena
we are your friends .
ok ? you are supposed to share the smut .
we just talked for hours .
ok , what is with the blockage ?
just jump his bones already ! ok , it &apos;s easy .
boy likes girl , girl likes boy
sex .
profound .
where are you going ?
caroline &apos;s right . it is easy .
if i sit here long enough
i &apos;ll end up talking myself out of it
instead of doing what i started the day
saying i was going to do .
i picked up dinner . tacos .
i had an urge for guacamole .
no i &apos;m good thanks .
eat anyway . it &apos;s a ruse .
i want to talk .
hey you ! come .
sit .
back in school freshman year
i could eat my weight in nachos
with extra cheese .
it was my munchie food whenever i got stoned .
you get high ?
did .
past tense .
but yeah . loved it .
anything to get a little distraction
from life ... reality .
and it worked .
for a while .
never lasts though .
hey i &apos;m not saying
i wouldn &apos;t love to rail back and kick it
but with a thesis looming
and a waistline expanding ...
what the ...
finally you &apos;re awake .
hey . how are you feeling ?
you look better .
i was worried before .
you really had me freaked out with all that screaming .
wait what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
i feel fine .
good good .
doctor said you could come home tomorrow .
vick what attacked you in the woods ?
an animal .
what else could it have been ?
hey . how do you feel ?
i &apos;m ok .
i ... i &apos;m gonna ...
i &apos;m gonna go grab a coffee .
hey jer .
why are you here ?
i just wanted to see how you were doing .
did you see that look on matt &apos;s face ?
that was suspicion . i don &apos;t want people
to find out about us jeremy .
well you gotta get over that .
tyler is finally showing some interest .
you have to get over that too .
do you see mr. concerned ?
tyler ? are you under there ?
no .
it &apos;s not cool for people to know .
ok ? i &apos;m older than you
and matt and elena would freak .
no one &apos;s going to suspect anything .
why wouldn &apos;t i check on you ?
i mean i &apos;m the one who found you .
you are ?
yeah i carried you out of the woods .
thank you .
yeah , you &apos;re welcome .
stefan ?
stefan ?
i .. i &apos;m sorry for barging in . the door was ...
open .
you must be elena .
i &apos;m damon , stefan &apos;s brother .
he didn &apos;t tell me he had a brother .
well stefan &apos;s not one to brag .
please come .
i &apos;m sure stefan will be along any second .
this is your living room ?
living room , parlor , sotheby &apos;s auction .
it &apos;s a little kitschy for my taste .
i see why my brother &apos;s so smitten .
it &apos;s about time . for a while there
i never thought he &apos;d get over the last one .
nearly destroyed him .
the last one ?
yeah .
katherine , his girlfriend ?
oh , you two haven &apos;t had
the awkward exes conversation yet .
nope .
oops . well i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll come up now .
or maybe he didn &apos;t want to tell you
because he didn &apos;t want you
to think he was on the rebound .
we all know how those relationships end .
you say it like
every relationship is doomed to end .
i &apos;m a fatalist .
hello stefan .
elena .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming over .
i know . i should have called , i just ...
oh , don &apos;t be silly . you &apos;re welcome any time .
isn &apos;t she , stefan ?
you know i should break out the family photo albums
or some home movies .
but ... i have to warn you .
he wasn &apos;t always such a looker .
thank you for stopping by , elena .
nice to see you .
yeah , i should probably go .
it was nice to meet you , damon .
great meeting you too , elena .
stefan ?
stefan ?
great gal .
she &apos;s got spunk .
you on the other hand look pooped .
did you over @-@ exert yourself today ?
let me guess ... hospital .
someone had to clean up your mess .
well were you successful ?
did the powers of persuasion work ?
remember if you don &apos;t feed properly
none of those little tricks work right .
how long was elena here ?
were you worried , stefan ?
scared we may be doomed
to repeat the past ?
isn &apos;t that why you play
your little game &quot; i &apos;m a high school human &quot; ?
i &apos;m not playing any game .
of course you are .
we both know
the closest you &apos;ll ever get to humanity
is when you rip it open and feed on it .
what kind of game are you playing ...
damien ?
guess you &apos;ll just have to wait and see , won &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s on the rebound and has raging family issues .
well , at least it &apos;s an ex @-@ girlfriend .
wait till you date a guy with mommy issues
or cheating issues .
or amphetamine issues .
jeremy .
jeremy where were you ?
more stoner stories ?
look , jenna , i get it you were cool .
and so that &apos;s ... that &apos;s cool .
oh , no no no !
ow ! why ?
why ... why did you do that ?
listen up !
quit ditching class or you &apos;re grounded .
no discussion .
parental authority i like it .
sleep tight .
matt .
mattie ?
tonight , night of the comet .
would you like a program ?
he didn &apos;t call , huh ?
or text .
but i realized we never even exchanged that stuff .
we &apos;ve never gotten to the texting part .
that &apos;s an important milestone in any relationship .
isn &apos;t it ? the timing is wrong , anyway .
when is it ever right ?
i &apos;m not ready , bonnie .
who is ?
at least i put myself out there .
is that what you &apos;re calling it ?
what do you mean ?
all i &apos;m hearing is reasons why you can &apos;t .
what is damon doing here ? why did he come home ?
cause i came home .
he wants to make my life miserable .
that &apos;s how he enjoys his .
well , he &apos;s putting us all at risk .
this girl in the hospital could talk .
she won &apos;t .
i took care of her .
you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m not sure , zach .
i don &apos;t know how well it worked .
i &apos;m not as strong as damon .
so what happens if it doesn &apos;t work ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll deal with it .
is she worth it ?
uncle stefan , this girl you came back for .
vickie , what are you doing here ?
fighting with robert about my schedule .
you &apos;d think getting ripped up by a rabid animal
would merit an extra sick day .
are you feeling ok ?
i hurt .
well , the doctor gave you something , right ?
the kid stuff .
nothing with an &quot; o &quot; in it .
i think they were onto me .
here . knock yourself out , literally .
thanks , jer .
so you gonna , uh watch the comet later ?
i hadn &apos;t really thought about it .
but i could be talked into it .
i &apos;ll meet you out there in a few .
hey , vick . how you feeling ?
like you care .
what are you looking at , gilbert ?
hey , i got some candles .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
thank you .
you know , that comet ...
it &apos;s been traveling across space for thousands of years .
all alone .
yeah , bonnie says it &apos;s a harbinger of evil .
i think it &apos;s just a ball of ...
snow and ice
trapped on a path that it can &apos;t escape .
and once every 145 years
it gets to come home .
i &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
i wasn &apos;t myself .
you seem to spend a lot of time apologizing .
well , i have a lot to apologize for .
yesterday that wasn &apos;t about you , ok ?
you didn &apos;t tell me that you had a brother .
we &apos;re not close .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s complicated .
always .
he told me about your ex , katherine ?
what did he say ?
that she broke your heart .
that was a long time ago .
when you lose someone it stays with you
always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt .
elena ...
it &apos;s ok , stefan .
i get it .
you have no idea how much i get it .
complicated brother ? check .
complicated ex ? check .
too complicated to even
contemplate dating , double check .
it &apos;s ok .
we met and we talked
and it was epic , but ...
then the sun came up and reality set in
so ...
i know you .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know how
but ...
your face .
excuse me . sorry .
hey has anyone seen vickie ?
you &apos;re her stalker . you tell us .
i can &apos;t find her .
she probably found somebody else to party with .
sorry pill pusher i guess you &apos;ve been replaced .
what &apos;s with the pill pusher ?
ask him .
will you do this right now ?
are you dealing ?
she &apos;s never gonna go for you .
she already did .
over and over and over again .
yeah , right .
you slept with vickie donovan ?
i mean vickie donovan slept with you ?
there &apos;s no way .
and i didn &apos;t even have to force her into it .
what the hell is he talking about todd ?
nothing , man just ignore him he &apos;s a punk .
you know what how about all of you shut up
and help me find my sister ?
we &apos;ll check the back .
i &apos;ll check the square .
i &apos;ll come with you .
oh , no , no , no .
you are coming with me .
so that &apos;s your game now dealing ?
i &apos;m not dealing .
look i &apos;m sick
of the tough love speech jer .
it &apos;s really having no impact .
you and jenna between the two of you ...
we can stop if you want .
send you to a therapist
where you &apos;ll be forced to deal with it .
or to rehab where you &apos;ll sit in group
and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart .
or you could talk to me .
i vote for none of the above .
hey .
have you seen my sister ?
no , sorry .
i can &apos;t find her .
she &apos;s missing .
i &apos;ll keep an eye out for her .
hey , i saw you at the hospital yesterday .
did you ?
what were you doing there ?
visiting .
visiting ?
elena and i we &apos;ve known each other for a long time .
we might not be together right now
but i look out for her .
and i &apos;ll always look out for her .
you really have to stop screaming .
no , please , stop , don &apos;t ...
shh . i got you .
excuse me .
no ! no !
i gotta do it . i &apos;m not gonna drop you .
not bad .
have you been eating bunnies ?
let her go .
shh . really ?
ok .
no ! no , no , no !
relax .
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t need her to be dead , but ...
you might .
what attacked you the other night ?
i don &apos;t know . an animal .
are you sure about that ?
think .
think about it , think really hard .
what attacked you ?
a vampire .
who did this to you ?
you did !
wrong !
don &apos;t .
it was stefan .
don &apos;t .
come here .
stefan salvatore did this to you .
stefan salvatore did this to me .
he &apos;s a vampire .
a vicious murderous monster .
please , damon . please don &apos;t do this .
if you couldn &apos;t fix it before
i don &apos;t know what you can do now .
your choice of lifestyle
has made you weak .
a couple of vampire parlor tricks
is nothing compared to the power that you could have
that you now need .
but you can change that .
human blood gives you that .
no !
you have two choices .
you can feed and make her forget .
or you can let her run screaming &quot; vampire &quot;
through the town square .
that &apos;s what this is about ?
you want to expose me ?
no ! i want you to remember who you are !
why ? so what , so i &apos;ll feed ?
so i &apos;ll kill ?
so i &apos;ll remember what it &apos;s like to be brothers again ?
you know what let her go .
let her tell everyone that vampires
have returned to mystic falls .
let them chain me up
and let them drive a stake through my heart
because at least i &apos;ll be free of you .
come here , sweetheart .
no !
it &apos;s ok .
what happened ?
where am i ?
i ripped my stitches open .
you ok ?
i took some pills , man .
i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s good to be home .
think i might stay a while .
this town could use a bit of a wake @-@ up call .
don &apos;t you think ?
what are you up to , damon ?
that &apos;s for me to know and for you to ... dot dot dot .
give elena my best .
she said you found her wandering around .
yeah .
so
thanks .
it &apos;s just so much drama .
ever notice how the druggies
are the biggest attention whores ?
excuse me . hi .
hi .
have you guys seen elena ?
i think she went home .
i &apos;m gonna give you elena &apos;s cell number and her email .
she is big on texting
and you can tell her ...
i said so .
thank you .
you ok ?
what happened to you ?
that &apos;s so rude .
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me .
she kind of wigs out .
it &apos;s like her thing .
jer ?
no . it &apos;s me the hypocrite patrol .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve become my worst nightmare .
the authority figure who has to
violate a 15 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s privacy .
jackpot .
i see the hiding places haven &apos;t gotten any more creative .
what brought this on ?
your ass @-@ hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday .
you got tannered . been there .
&quot; discover the impossible ms. summers . &quot;
got it . thanks .
like i didn &apos;t know i was screwing up .
you &apos;re not screwing up aunt jenna .
yes , i am .
you know why ?
because i &apos;m not her .
she made everything look so easy .
high school , marriage , having you .
i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m gonna say or do the wrong thing
and he &apos;s gonna get worse and it &apos;s gonna be my fault .
it &apos;s impossible .
this is just the fear talking .
you &apos;re a little scared
that &apos;s all .
we all are .
i have to go do something .
but are you going to be ok ?
sorry . didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
no . it &apos;s fine .
i was hoping i &apos;d see you again .
i know .
cocky much ?
very much .
would you like to come in ?
the comet &apos;s actually this way .
sorry for barging in .
especially after earlier .
no ... no . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
the way we left things ... i didn &apos;t like it .
see , the thing is
i got home tonight planning on doing what i always do
write in my diary
like i have been since my mom
gave me one when i was 10 .
it &apos;s where i get everything out , everything i &apos;m feeling .
it all goes in this little book
that i hide on the second shelf
behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid .
but then i realized that i &apos;d just be writing things
that i should probably be telling you .
what would you write ?
i would write ...
&quot; dear diary
&quot; today i convinced myself it was ok to give up .
&quot; don &apos;t take risks .
&quot; stick with the status quo .
&quot; no drama . now is just not the time .
&quot; but my reasons aren &apos;t reasons . they &apos;re excuses .
&quot; all i &apos;m doing is hiding from the truth
and the truth is that ... &quot;
i &apos;m scared , stefan .
i &apos;m scared that if i let myself
be happy for even one moment that ...
the world &apos;s just going to come crashing down
and i ...
i don &apos;t know if i can survive that .
do you want to know what i would write ?
&quot; i met a girl .
&quot; we talked .
it was epic . &quot;
&quot; but then the sun came up and reality set in . &quot;
&quot; well , this is reality .
