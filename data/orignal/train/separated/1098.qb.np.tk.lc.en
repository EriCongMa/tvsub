the rv . it &apos;s gone .
em , are you gonna be able to swim ?
i &apos;m jake .
do you teach privately ?
when would you like to start ?
today .
i moved the rv .
&quot; a &quot; asked for it in exchange for the transcript
from my mother &apos;s doctor at radley
written on the night she killed herself .
hey , mom .
hi , honey . this is zack .
my partner and i are investigating the murders
of officer reynolds and detective wildenen
were you in new york the whole time you were gone ?
did you come back to have it out with wilden ?
if you &apos;re asking if i killed him ,
the answer is no .
miss me ?
god , she sounds just like ali .
hey , what &apos;s this song ?
it &apos;s not a song ... it &apos;s a phone number .
okay , my mom is not connected to a cockatoo .
parrot .
whatever .
well , that bird is connected to ali ,
ali &apos;s connected to wilden , and wilden &apos;s connected
to your mom and us and stuff we don &apos;t even know anything about .
my mom may have hit him a little with her car ,
but she did not kill wilden .
of course not .
hey , how &apos;s your shoulder ?
i &apos;m seeing the doctor again tomorrow .
why would you take all this stuff ?
i took the bird stuff and the rest of the junk
to get past mrs. dilaurentis with ali &apos;s notebooks .
we learned so much from what ali wrote down in em &apos;s bio book .
who knows what could be written in these ?
&quot; eat , bake , love . &quot;
they look cozy .
yeah , they do .
how &apos;s jake ?
he &apos;s nice .
no . seriously , he &apos;s nice .
we &apos;re seeing each other tonight .
great .
well , you don &apos;t have to say it like that .
i didn &apos;t say it like anything .
is it weird to be jealous of your mom &apos;s love life ?
vienna ?
well , outside vienna .
um , in a castle on a lake .
wow . pastry must be serious business in austria .
how long would you be gone ?
less than a year .
well , that sounds like an incredible opportunity .
yeah . it is .
they only chose five americans .
so ... would you like to come with me ?
would i what ?
would you like to come with me to austria ?
you know , reading shelley by a lake next to a castle ...
i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t . okay .
well , that &apos;s better than &quot; won &apos;t . &quot;
why ... can &apos;t you ?
well , one reason is sitting over there with her friends .
take motherhood off the table for a minute .
well , for one thing , it would be very impractical .
that &apos;s the point of doing it .
hey , em , could you ditch this stuff someplace ?
i don &apos;t want mona to see it and start asking us questions .
yeah . i &apos;ll take it home .
where is mona ?
i don &apos;t know . she wasn &apos;t at school .
not knowing where she is makes me
just as nervous as when she &apos;s all over us .
you guys , what &apos;s this ?
that ain &apos;t no cuttlebone .
this was in ali &apos;s room ?
it was either here or at her grandmother &apos;s .
it doesn &apos;t really seem her speed .
spence .
when did she get back ?
why did she come back ?
yeah , i thought she was gone for good
when they found wilden .
mona said that your sister was with wilden on the train ,
and then she just leaves the night he &apos;s killed ?
mona said she was on the train .
just because mona said it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not true .
how was washington ?
very interesting .
they liked me , i liked them .
well , what &apos;s not to like ?
i think they &apos;re gonna offer me an internship .
might be san francisco , could be london .
wow ! how exciting .
i hear things have been exciting around here .
wilden &apos;s dead , somebody shot him and stuffed him
in his own trunk and left him in the middle of town .
but , you know , it &apos;s the same old , same old .
it &apos;s terrible .
you don &apos;t know who would want to do that to him , do you ?
i have no clue , and i &apos;ve been out of town .
yeah . having an interview in washington ,
and now you might go to san francisco , maybe even london ...
chance of a lifetime .
it &apos;s like the perfect getaway .
it might be time for both of us to get out of this little town--
if we know what &apos;s good for us .
so where was your dad ?
he was fishing .
he went out on this lake every morning ,
according to the guy at the campground .
i sat on the dock and waited for him .
i waited most of the day , actually .
it was getting dark when he came back in .
what &apos;d you say to him ?
i told him i was sorry .
i told him that pastor ted
found out it was someone at the foundry who switched the bell .
what did he say to that ?
he asked me if that &apos;s why i was there .
i told him no ,
i was there because i ...
should have listened to him , backed him up .
i should have believed him .
i didn &apos;t say anything after that . i just stood there .
i was gonna let him take a swing at me if he wanted to .
did he ?
no .
he , uh , tossed his string at me
and asked if i knew how to clean a fish .
i do , so we , uh , fried up his catch and had dinner .
well , it sounds like it might be okay .
yeah . might be .
hanna .
your mom didn &apos;t do it .
well , then &quot; a &quot; &apos; s gonna make her look guiltier and guiltier
until the cops start paying attention .
okay , look , shoes or no shoes ,
we know she was in new york the night wilden died .
so all we have to do is prove she was in new york .
well , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s all ,
but it &apos;s a start .
vienna ? in austria ?
that &apos;s the one .
don &apos;t sound too surprised .
i &apos;m not surprised , i &apos;m ... impressed .
that &apos;s better .
are--are you gonna go ?
there was a split second where i thought about buying a ticket
and going with him .
only a second ?
you &apos;d be surprised how long a second can last .
well , do you want to go ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
i didn &apos;t ask if it was simple or hard ,
i just asked if you wanted to go .
are you worried of what
will happen if you &apos;re away from him for a year ?
less than a year .
still , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a long time to be away from someone .
yes .
yes , it is .
strike three .
are you sure what you got from the bird was a real phone number ?
it wouldn &apos;t ring if it wasn &apos;t a real phone number .
it &apos;s just not in any reverse directory i can find .
are you okay ?
i just keep reading dr. palmer &apos;s notes .
i wanted to know what happened to my mom .
it &apos;s just not in there .
they &apos;re gonna find out what you did .
with the lair . emily and the others .
i know .
we should tell them before
they find out from somebody else .
i don &apos;t think i could look them in the eye .
the thing about &quot; a , &quot; when it was mona ...
whatever it is now ...
she always knows when you &apos;re at your weakest .
&quot; she &quot; ?
it &apos;s always felt like a she , hasn &apos;t it ?
&quot; check the facts . &quot; that &apos;s what &quot; a &quot; told you , right ?
the facts are , my mom stole a key ,
unlocked a window at radley , and jumped .
those are the facts , but how are we supposed to check them ?
you &apos;d go back there ?
if i thought it would help .
what is it ?
what &apos;s what ?
you &apos;re looking at me like
you thought i might steal your chicken satay .
oh . no , i just ...
i just think you were gypped .
how &apos;s that ?
well , you went to new york ,
and all you got to see was the inside of a stupid hotel .
come on . that was a business seminar ,
not a pleasure trip .
so you didn &apos;t get to do anything .
you didn &apos;t go shopping or ...
go to a restaurant ?
do you want my itinerary , hanna ?
it was conferences and meetings the whole time .
and then they marched us off
to a musical on friday night as a reward .
what show ?
&quot; anything goes . &quot;
bring me the plates .
okay .
go .
you better look at this .
messenger brought it this morning .
eight @-@ thirty @-@ five .
that &apos;s right .
takes a nice picture .
i don &apos;t trust her .
it &apos;s film noir .
you &apos;re not supposed to trust anybody .
a woman telephoned me shortly after this thing was delivered .
what else was there ?
why are detective movies always in black and white ?
black and white &apos;s a different world .
i love it .
hmm , i don &apos;t know ,
i see it a black and white movie on tv ,
and i think something &apos;s broken .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
you know where this picture was taken ?
i haven &apos;t the slightest idea .
i had you goin &apos; for a minute , didn &apos;t i ?
why &apos;s it make you so nervous ,
the idea that i might not like something as much as you do ?
i just want to make sure that we have stuff in common , ya know ?
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s great to have things in common .
but if people match up too much , then there aren &apos;t any surprises .
yeah , that &apos;d be pretty dull .
and i don &apos;t think you like dull .
no , i don &apos;t .
she was in all evening .
police already checked that when they called about owen .
go ahead and scratch .
you told the emt you fell off your bike .
that &apos;s what happened .
you hit your shoulder pretty hard .
no other cuts or bruises .
guess i &apos;m lucky .
i guess so .
i sent the x @-@ rays and mri for a consult .
looks like you &apos;re still having some discomfort .
would you like me to write a prescription for something to help ?
maybe hydrocodone ?
no , i &apos;ve had a bad reaction to that .
i don &apos;t see that in your file .
who prescribed it for you ?
i mean , i &apos;ve heard you could have a bad reaction to it .
all right .
i &apos;ll call when i hear back on the consult .
bye .
bye .
sorry . i forgot that i had them .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re supposed
to live in the dish by the front door .
you know , it would be a lot easier if i had my own set .
yeah , it would .
who are these from ?
the bank .
i think they bought them by the carload
for everyone who was in new york .
oh . you know what ? i &apos;ll be right back .
演出很无聊 你什么都没错过
hanna .
hanna !
hello .
vienna &apos;s a long way to go for some strudel .
fancy the baker is .
would she go ?
well , she says no , but i think she &apos;s actually thinking about it .
what do you think about it ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i mean , i miss her not being in the house ,
i can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;d be like
if she was on a different continent .
any luck with big bird &apos;s phone number ?
no . i plugged it into every reverse directory
and search engine i could .
but it &apos;s a real number ; it &apos;s going to a real line .
but i can &apos;t even find a name or even a town .
dead end ?
no , not yet .
i &apos;m not giving up on it .
i started going through ali &apos;s notebooks .
there &apos;s a lot of &apos; em . i could use some help .
i can come over tonight .
um , i can &apos;t tonight .
i promised toby that i would help him with something .
okay . i &apos;m sure the two of us can handle it .
emily .
mom ?
i thought i &apos;d give you a ride .
okay . sure .
now , emily .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;ll talk about it in the car .
no . is dad okay ?
your father &apos;s fine .
this is about you .
what about me ?
dr. vargas called .
he wanted to know if i &apos;d ever given you any of the hydrocodone
that i was prescribed last year .
why would he ask you that ?
he said you were uncertain if you &apos;d ever taken it .
i &apos;ve never taken it .
emily , i checked the bottle . i counted the pills .
now , i might be one or two off ,
but there are more than seven pills missing .
did you take them ?
i didn &apos;t take them .
then where did they go ?
emily , please , i need some kind of an explanation .
what is -- emily . hey !
let &apos;s go . get in the car .
no !
get in the car .
let go of my arm !
i &apos;m sorry .
just get in the car now .
please .
what is going on ?
i have no idea .
一个一个来 我会追查到底的 亲亲 -a
look , most innocent people don &apos;t have alibis
because they don &apos;t know they need them .
yeah , but my mom lied about where she was .
it &apos;s not the same thing . she was in rosewood that night .
all you know is that she wasn &apos;t at that play .
i &apos;m gonna end up with a mom or a dad .
has your mom talked to your dad about this at all ?
no . my parents communicate through attorneys
ever since my dad and his stepford wife
pulled kate out of rosewood high .
maybe talking to an attorney isn &apos;t such a bad idea .
you think she did something ?
no . i -- i &apos;m just saying ,
the ground isn &apos;t that solid right now .
rosewood p.d.
can i help you ?
i was looking for pam fields ,
emily &apos;s mom ?
i -- i brought her some flowers .
we should step outside .
um , what --
what is all that ?
it &apos;s how you break down a murder case .
if you want to solve it .
and everything on that board
has to do with who killed wilden ?
most of it .
well , why is my name on that board ?
lots of people on that board .
people who knew him , people who didn &apos;t even know they knew him .
one by one , you take people off the list .
just part of the process . nothing to worry about .
yeah , unless you &apos;re the last name left .
well , then you might have a problem .
excuse me .
miss hastings .
mr. marin .
caleb .
i didn &apos;t want to bother you in your office .
i just wanted to make sure you knew what was going on .
what exactly are we talking about ?
detective wilden .
what &apos;s that got to do with me ?
you know that he was bothering your wife and your daughter .
hanna &apos;s mother is my ex @-@ wife .
the point is ,
he was giving them a hard time ,
and it wasn &apos;t exactly a secret .
now he &apos;s dead .
yes , we &apos;ve established that .
hey , they &apos;re bringing in some state investigators .
hanna &apos;s worried that they &apos;re gonna try to pin it on her mom .
if that happens , they are both gonna need help .
what kind of help ?
hanna &apos;s mom &apos;s gonna need a lawyer , and hanna ...
hanna needs to know that you &apos;re gonna be there for her .
okay ? she needs her father .
i &apos;ll keep all this in mind . thank you , caleb .
you &apos;re welcome . i think .
hey , did you end up telling your mom that you took her pills ?
had to .
but did you tell her why you took them ?
which &quot; why &quot; should i tell ?
the one i told the emts , or the one i told paige ?
i &apos;m not doing well on the lie detector this week .
it wasn &apos;t that big of a lie .
do you hear yourself ?
i took my mom &apos;s prescription meds .
it &apos;s not that big of a lie
compared to everything else we &apos;ve had to deal with .
i don &apos;t even want to think about
the size of the story we &apos;re gonna have to come up with
if somebody sees that video of us in wilden &apos;s car .
em .
what ?
look at this . tell me what you see .
oh , my god . it &apos;s ali .
this looks like the mask that hanna saw on the train .
and it may be the one that all of us saw at the lodge .
why did ali have one ?
because she was the original . she must have modeled for it .
why would she do something like that ?
&quot; that &apos;s immortality , my darlings . &quot;
why did mona have a copy ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but we can &apos;t ask mona .
wait , look . there &apos;s a mark stamped on the back .
i do not appreciate you spying on me .
i was not spying . i just happened to look in the waste basket .
you deliberately looked .
you lied to me .
i do not have to account for myself to you !
mom , i don &apos;t care about the stupid play , all right ?
but why would you lie about it ?
do not ask me any more questions .
hanna .
if anyone asks you ...
i &apos;ll say you were at the show .
don &apos;t lie .
just don &apos;t say anything .
hello .
okay . if we go through the children &apos;s wing and the service corridor ,
we can upstairs without going through the wards .
what if they changed the codes ?
mona didn &apos;t give me the codes . she gave me the override numbers .
mona must have been very impressed with you .
i &apos;m a fast learner .
it &apos;s the same one .
not the same mask mona had on the train ,
but it &apos;s the same face , the same expression .
they &apos;re from the same mold . turn it over .
&quot; hector lime . dimensional artist . &quot;
that &apos;s his web address under his name .
his studio &apos;s on the far side of torch lake .
he makes masks and statues and props for horror films .
ali went there , and he copied her face .
if he made one , he must have made others .
that &apos;s why we called you and spencer .
where is spencer ?
i don &apos;t know . the call went straight to voicemail .
ali was at the studio . both masks came from the same place .
yeah , but we don &apos;t know how many there are or who has them ...
and if they got them from ali or from this guy &apos;s studio .
let &apos;s go find out .
shouldn &apos;t we wait for spencer ?
no , we can handle this on our own .
what ? we can &apos;t make a move without nancy drew ?
this mask connects us to ali and the halloween train ,
which connects us to wilden .
the police have our names on a board with arrows and graphs ,
and not just ours-- my mom &apos;s up there .
so i &apos;m not waiting for spencer ,
because &quot; a &apos;s &quot; not waiting for anyone . now come on .
i feel like i just got drafted .
ali came out here alone ?
she must have .
there &apos;s someone on the porch .
hello ?
okay , should we talk about this plan ?
i like it better when people call first .
that &apos;s what it says in the ad .
did you , uh ,
did you make this ?
well ...
you better come in .
the file says it was the east side window .
that &apos;s gotta be it .
this is where she did it .
she had her session with dr . palmer ,
all about how much she wanted to live ...
then she stole a key from the nurses station ...
and she came in here ...
she unlocked the window ...
i wanted the truth .
here it is .
oh , my god , spence ...
i gave the rv to &quot; a &quot; for nothing .
i hate it when people do this to my work .
so it is yours .
my stamp on the back .
which i guess is how you got here ?
why &apos;d you make it ?
didn &apos;t your friend tell you ?
no , she didn &apos;t . she &apos;s dead .
so , um , how did you guys meet ?
well , i put an ad on the internet .
i was looking for a model .
i needed a joan of arc .
someone young and ...
beautiful ...
and a warrior .
your friend was perfect .
so you used her for joan of arc .
what about the mask ?
you would make a great medusa .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got a client who would love you as medusa .
i could do it where the snakes actually--
you were telling us about our friend .
how many of those masks did you make ?
suppose we do a little barter .
i &apos;ll tell you what i know ,
and you give me something in return .
what do you want ?
your face .
but are you sure that this is the right room ?
this is the room .
what are you getting at ?
look at the roof .
see how it juts out , what , 10 , 15 feet
all the way around the building ?
how could somebody who jumped from here
have cleared that roof and then fall clean to the ground ?
i don &apos;t know how your mom fell , but i don &apos;t think she jumped--
not from here .
i think &quot; a &quot; gave you something real .
i &apos;ve gotta find dr. palmer .
i &apos;ve gotta talk to somebody who saw her that day .
hey . we &apos;ll find him .
the whole thing will be over before you know it .
well , you better ask your questions while you still can .
is this what you did with ali to copy her face ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
so you used her for joan of arc ,
but what about the mask ?
well , that was alison &apos;s idea . she asked me to make them .
she said she wanted masks for all her friends
so they could look like her .
i made them . hard masks and soft ones .
they turned out very well .
did you make them for anyone else ?
look , we have to get started . this stuff sets up fast .
so just ... relax , sit back .
you &apos;re doing fine .
you were telling us about alison .
yes . alison ordered the masks ;
i made them and handed them over .
did you keep any ?
i broke the mold when i was finished .
why ?
because she told me to .
you and i need to talk .
now , i want you to breathe in through your nose
and breathe out gently through your mouth .
oh , that &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s perfect !
the whole time i was thinking of ali
and how that &apos;s what it must feel like to be buried alive .
did you find anything ?
yeah , i found something .
if you &apos;re involved in this ,
if ashley sent you to me , just say so .
nobody sent me to you , mr. marin , okay ?
you knew that she was in rosewood that night .
hanna &apos;s mom .
did she tell you , or did you see her ?
i saw her .
she came to my house around nine o &apos;clock .
isabelle had some people over ,
so we talked in my office above the garage .
she say anything about wilden ?
nope .
she called me , came over , said she needed money ,
more money than i had-- we &apos;re not very liquid right now .
and what happened when you told her no ?
isabelle wanted me for something .
i came back , ashley was gone .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that this afternoon ?
you &apos;re just on the edge of this right now .
you could still walk away .
i love your daughter , mr. marin .
after we talked today ,
i went home , i went up to my office ,
and i did something i &apos;ve been afraid to do since wilden got shot .
i keep a gun locked in my desk .
i looked for it . it &apos;s missing .
come in .
i thought we had an understanding
about you were staying in tonight .
hanna needed my help .
what &apos;s this ?
nothing . it &apos;s just clay .
did someone from family services call you ?
family services ? no .
well , they called me . they want to interview me .
about what ?
about you .
apparently someone thought
i was a little excessive with you outside the school .
so they called family services .
and some snippy little bureaucrat
says that they detect some kind of a pattern .
what kind of a pattern ?
your shoulder ,
how you wound up in the hospital with an ulcer ,
the trouble that you &apos;ve had with the police ...
the fact that your dad is ... away so much .
she even talked to dr. vargas .
who talked to dr. vargas ?
the social worker .
whatever happened to privacy in this country , anyway .
i don &apos;t know .
look , don &apos;t worry about it .
we &apos;ll get this straightened out .
so , a decaf , non @-@ fat iced mocha .
that &apos;s pretty much a glass of chocolate milk , right ?
yeah , pretty much ,
but you feel more grown up when you order it .
will you excuse me for a second ?
sure .
you have to go to vienna with zack .
what ?
go with him .
i am ordering you to follow your bliss .
are you trying to get rid of me ?
i &apos;m trying to get you to go on an adventure .
mom , mike and i , we &apos;re gonna be just fine with dad .
well , as long as he doesn &apos;t
try to make that vegetarian lasagna again .
aria , i think i know what you &apos;re trying to do .
but you have to understand ,
i &apos;ve thought about this a lot ,
and it just won &apos;t be easy for anybody .
passion isn &apos;t supposed to be easy .
it &apos;s supposed to be passionate .
i am not gonna sit here
and discuss passion with my daughter .
then don &apos;t discuss it ,
and do not talk yourself out of something that you want
and is something that you deserve .
mom , please do this .
please ? i need the inspiration .
it would certainly be something to tell the grandkids .
absolutely .
it &apos;s none of my business ,
but that looked kind of intense .
no , not really .
i was just giving my mother permission to go off
and join the circus .
that was nice of you .
will you miss her ?
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry .
no , no . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
really . i--
she needs to go .
where were you ? why weren &apos;t you answering your phone ?
i was with toby . we just wanted some privacy , okay ?
well , look in here and see what you missed .
melissa ?
yeah .
that &apos;s what we said when we saw it .
this was from the studio that ali went to ?
melissa must have been there .
he copied your sister &apos;s face
just like he did alison &apos;s .
so did melissa follow ali there ,
did ali follow melissa ?
maybe they went together .
mom ?
yes , hanna ?
i just wanted to let you know that i &apos;m back .
all right .
hanna ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry .
about ... before .
it &apos;s all right .
are you okay ?
yes , i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t worry .
come in .
i saw hanna at the police station today .
did she mention that ?
yeah , she did .
i was wondering what she was doing there .
she was wondering the same thing about you .
the new investigator asked me to come in .
he wanted to talk about darren wilden .
i think they &apos;re talking to everybody
who had anything to do with him .
were you of any help ?
i don &apos;t think so . i hardly knew him .
you guys went to high school together .
seems like such a long time ago .
so much has happened since then .
do you ever think about how much has changed ?
all the people that are gone ?
yeah , i do .
what does it all mean ?
uh ... i think that &apos;s an awful big question
for this time of night .
do you suppose other sisters
have as much trouble getting along as we do ?
there might be a few .
maybe we &apos;re just too much alike ,
and that &apos;s the problem .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
you asked me a question once .
if it came down to protecting you
or protecting somebody else ,
somebody i loved , who would i pick ?
do you remembe ?
yeah , i do .
what would your answer be
if i asked you the same question ?
if you had to choose ... what would you do ?
emily ?
i &apos;m awake .
i thought you should know . your dad &apos;s coming home .
he is ?
i just got off the phone with him .
family services called him , too .
