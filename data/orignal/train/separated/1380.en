Dickwad who bought this triumph should try going to the gym
to bulk up instead of asking you to modify it for power.
I ain't modifying anything.
I'm tearing it apart and putting it back together.
Charging him 400 bucks.
Sweet gear set.
Yeah, this drive belt is pretty smooth, too.
You should convince your guy it's not his kind of ride.
Sells it back to you cheap.
My nephew needs a new bike.
You mother --
Ah, the spicy mustard.
I thought Angela was gonna choke.
Oh, where are you guys?
That street fair in Newton.
Yeah, where was I?
On a stakeout?
Have you talked to agent Davies?
No. Not yet.
Aw! That's a great picture of Frankie. Look at that.
Where was this?
We tried to get into a Celtics game,
but we couldn't get tickets.
So we just sat outside and ate pizza.
I didn't do this.
No, I think you were going through receipts
to identify a witness.
Ah, the yacht races!
I'm not in that one, am I?
I didn't even ask you to go.
Maura!
I just...
I thought we were supposed to be pictures
to put in my home pictures that,
in theory, reflect my life experience.
And I did. I found that picture of our trip from L.A.
One.
Okay. And I am sure...
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna f-- I'm gonna keep looking.
And I did tell Angela to go through her pictures,
so I'm sure she'll bring some by.
What?
Oh, this? You mean keep reading this?
I don't know. Is it that awful?
No. It's great.
You're just saying that because you're my friend.
No, I would -- I would totally read this book.
I would --I would read it if there were more of it.
Is there more of it?
Well, no. That's it. One chapter.
But you really like it?
Yeah. I really do.
Isles.
Rizzoli.
What was that for?
I'm taking a picture of us
reading the first chapter of your best-seller.
You know, a picture that I'm actually in.
Yeah.
The sway bar bushing on my sidecar needs to be looked at.
Maybe I should bring it here.
I'd wait till they get new mechanics.
Feels like an execution to me.
Killer was pretty close with a shotgun.
So this guy takes one to the chest.
The other guy tries to make a run for it,
gets hit in the back.
Uniforms found a loaded handgun on that shelf.
Neither of them made a move to get it, though,
which means they knew the killer and didn't suspect any danger,
or he was really quiet and snuck up on 'em.
Light-footed.
Or he flew.
You thinking a fairy?
They are the natural enemy of a biker.
Well, I think you're spot on
with your cause of death, sergeant.
But I'm not so sure I believe in
your tinker bell theory, detective.
Too small to carry the gun?
No, there's just no pixie dust on our crime scene.
You know what? Looks like a lipstick smudge.
If the killer was a girlfriend,
maybe that explains how she got so close without them reacting.
Well, I'm not ready to give up on my fairy theory yet.
This is a weird place for fingerprints.
Okay, I'm ready.
Rest of the guns are on their way.
The first load is laid out for your examination.
Thank you.
So if the serial numbers have been removed,
we may be able to pull some up chemically.
Make sure the techs check the metal for ridges.
Sure. Will do.
Hello, Mister...Leo.
And according to his right pectoral,
his mother's name was Gladys.
It's hard not to see these tattoos as premature obituaries.
Mm, archeologists now theorize that the earliest tattoos
may have been therapeutic,
An attempt to alleviate pain, perhaps.
I'm sure he got a lot of comfort from that one --
"If it don't roar, it don't soar."
Well, I didn't say that was the current thinking.
Okay, so I will start the autopsy,
And you process the lipstick.
There's a possibility that there's a foreign DNA
in that sample.
Unless he was wearing it and didn't like the color.
So a guy who was out walking his dog last night
says he saw a woman running from the repair shop
about the time of the shooting.
He get a good look at her?
No. It was dark and he just saw someone running.
He says he thinks it was a woman because she ran like a girl.
Did he see a gun?
No.
So he might've seen someone exercising.
Yep. You two got anything?
Both our vics rode with the Lords of Thunder.
Leo was top dog, and Grimm was his lieutenant.
According to organized crime,
the L.O.T. has been doing business with some Albanians.
Well, the Albanians buying the guns or selling them?
Selling, I think.
Maybe our bikers found a cheaper source and reneged on the deal?
Kelly Wagner.
Okay.
That's a DNA match for lipstick we found on the biker.
Okay, she was in foster care.
Yeah, a pretty steady work history.
Known associate of the Lords of Thunder.
Short sheet. Nonviolent crimes only.
Double homicide seems like a bit of a stretch.
So maybe she's the witness.
You got an address?
Nothing current, but she does have an EBT card.
She uses it almost exclusively in Dorchester,
including...20 minutes ago.
I'll get Jane. You two get in a car.
Send her picture to uniforms in the area.
If she's a witness to a double homicide,
We need to find her before the killer does.
Okay, thank you.
I've got nothing.
Jane and Korsak finished.
They're moving a few blocks over.
Excuse me, ma'am.
BPD. We're looking for this woman.
Do you know her? Have you seen her recently?
No.
Can you take a closer look? It's important.
I don't know her. Sorry.
Put it down!
Put it down!
Thanks, Nina.
Coral blush.
Same shade of lipstick we found smudged on Leo Danner.
A smudge that happens to have your DNA in it.
We also have an eyewitness that saw a woman leaving the scene
of Leo and Grimm's murder.
Easy enough to set up a lineup,
let the witness identify you.
Look, I understand your instinct to stay silent,
but if you are the shooter, we'll prove it.
The D.A. will go a lot easier on you if you cooperate.
Yeah, if you're an innocent witness,
someone out there is gonna want you dead.
We can keep that from happening.
Associating with the lords of thunder
is a violation of your parole for possession.
We'll just send you downtown till you decided
to change your mind and talk to us.
You can't do that.
Then talk to us.
I've got nothing to say.
Call us if you change your mind.
Okay, if I scramble all these,
how long do you think it would take you
to put them back together?
Well, I wouldn't bother because the ones without
evidentiary value are destined for the crusher.
Which means at least one of them has evidentiary value.
Yes, but just one.
So as you'd expect,
the serial numbers were filed down.
But all the guns were wiped clean, which is unusual,
but we were able to pull a single partial print.
Which is not enough for court.
But it is enough to identify a suspect.
Endrit Amiti.
American-albanian.
Well, he's been arrested enough times,
but none of the charges have stuck.
You know what?
This will be great for your book.
You're writing a book?
Yes, she is.
I've just written one chapter.
Oh. And am I in it?
I could be a dashing scottish medical examiner's assistant.
Yeah!
If that doesn't scream "best-seller,"
I don't know what does.
You -- you will be in the acknowledgments.
Right.
Well, just don't make me English.
I'll never live it down.
Oh, my God. Please make him English.
Please, please, please make him English!
Put it down!
Put it down!
Put it down!
How's your head?
Doc says my melon's a-ok.
Wanna grab lunch? I'm craving Indian.
No.
You okay?
I'm worried...
about that Kelly Wagner takedown.
I-I feel like...
I wasn't completely in control.
No, that's not true.
My finger was on the trigger.
I didn't need to have my finger on the trigger.
I shouldn't have -- - You didn't do anything wrong.
What if I shot her?
You didn't.
I don't think we should go in the field together.
You are overreacting.
Telling me my feelings aren't valid
doesn't make me feel any better.
I'm -- I'm sorry. I-I didn't --
I'll talk to you later.
What the Feds tell us is that you and your friends
are the most dangerous criminals on the east coast.
Is that supposed to be some kind of compliment?
They say that you play by new rules,
basically no rules at all.
"Give us what we want or die philosophy" is what they say.
One would not have many friends if one lived a life like that.
These your friends?
Who are these people?
We found your fingerprint on a gun in one of their shops.
We're not buying that you don't know them.
Are you implying that I am part of some kind
of criminal enterprise?
No, no, we're saying that.
We're saying that you killed these two men
because they made you angry or they...
cut in line in front of you at Starbucks.
I have done nothing.
Well, we're gonna hold you on an illegal firearms charge
while we check that out.
You would be wise --
Oh, shut up.
Talk to you after you've been processed.
We interviewed most of the bikers who aren't currently in jail.
Stonewalled by one and all.
"The code" is holding.
If there's any vengeance to be had,
they're planning on getting it themselves.
Okay, what about the Albanians?
Well, they're trickier to track down,
but we're working our way through the list.
Well, Endrit Amiti's warrant
should be ready within the hour.
As much of a jackass of epic proportions that I think he is,
I believed him when he said he didn't kill Leo and Grimm.
And what about Kelly Wagner?
Did we find anything else background-wise?
Her last known address was near the shop.
Neighbor said she moved away six months ago.
EBT card fits the same timeline,
as does a job she picked up at a bar in Dorchester.
Okay, what about this?
New job, better neighborhood,
maybe she wants a better life, Leo didn't wanna let her go.
She could've moved further away.
Shooting him seems excessive.
I know. You're right. I hate my theory.
Just got off the phone with the warden
at the Suffolk County Jail.
Someone got to Kelly already?
No, he has a jailhouse snitch
who says Kelly's trying to hire a hit man.
She just went in six hours ago.
She's desperate,
which tells me she's probably our witness.
She's scared for her safety, and she's trying to get
to the killer before he gets to her.
I'll bet we figure out who her target is, we wrap up this case.
She's not gonna talk to us. So what do we do?
Maybe I get myself arrested.
Because prisons are dangerous,
studies show that inmates become hypervigilant
about signs of threat.
So a tough veneer projects a threat of violence,
which keeps other inmates at bay.
So you think I should put on a tough veneer?
Oh, you have a tough veneer.
Maybe even have tough under veneer.
I'm suggesting you keep it.
Okay, so how far up the neck do you wanna go?
Well, I don't know. How long does this fruit stuff stay on?
It's not actually a fruit.
It's the ink made out of an extract of fruit.
Maura...
It's the genipa americana.
So a week or two depending on how quickly you exfoliate.
I don't know how quickly I exfoliate.
All right, so let's say two weeks.
Not the face.
Okay.
Your cover's set.
Hey.
Federal D.O.C. has existing aliases for operations like this.
You are Lisa Caro.
You're being brought in for an extradition hearing.
I hate the name Lisa.
Relax. You'll only have it for a couple of days.
That's as long as I'm gonna let you stay in Suffolk.
I can stay in there as long as I need to.
No, you can't. It's not safe. That's a good-looking tattoo.
Oh, thank you.
The warden is moving any inmates
that might have possibly intersected with you.
Arrested by BPD homicide,
relatives arrested by homicide,
any women who went to high school with you,
grew up in your neighborhood.
Well, that could be a lot.
Can you not?
Well, how about the relatives of police personnel?
Good question. I'll confirm.
The snitch who gave us the tip is also being moved.
She may get suspicious when you show up so soon after the tip
and be willing to settle that suspicion for a pack of smokes.
All right.
Oh, you can't believe the photos that I found.
Hey, Ma.
What's going on?
Why are you getting such an enormous tattoo?
Jane?
Yeah, uh...
Okay. Um, you know what?
Ma, can I, uh, talk to you? Just in here for a minute?
Please?
Everything's fine, okay? Um...
Jane, what's going on?
I'm going undercover.
Where?
The county jail.
Oh, my lord.
Ma, it's just to find information. That's all.
What the hell is wrong with you?
It's a double homicide.
I'm trying to stop somebody else from being killed.
Okay, I support you in that. But this is too much.
Ma, it's my --
Don't say it! Don't say "Job."
Say "Christmas," say "Frog."
Yeah, that doesn't really make any sense, ma. "It's my frog" --
Shut up, Jane.
First Korsak's wedding, Ron and my breakup.
There are consequences for the rest of us.
Ma...
Isn't being a cop enough?
Now you have to be a cop
that puts herself with a bunch of criminals?
Korsak and Maura would never let anything happen.
I know that.
And you'll probably be fine.
Then you'll come home, and we'll --
We'll all pretend it's normal
to think about what you'd look like in a casket.
I bet you'd look great.
Ma.
You got something off the clothes from Endrit's apartment?
Oh. Yes, I do.
Blood splatter consistent with a gunshot and a pair of shoes.
Although the blood doesn't belong to either of our victims.
Well, that's a twist I didn't see coming.
The soles of the shoes also had commercial soap
and laundry detergent on them.
So I was thinking a murderer in a laundromat?
Thanks. I'll check it out.
Yeah. Oh, hey.
Um, I won a-a raffle the other day
and I got this gift certificate
for a restaurant on the east side.
I was thinking the three of us could go sometime?
Oh. Right.
You guys are a great couple.
You really bring out the best in each other.
I'll, uh, check and...
Okay.
Put you in Wagner's dorm,
a couple beds down from her so it's not too obvious.
There are only two guards who know your status.
We'll work 12-hour shifts for as long as you're here.
We're thinking two days tops.
Probably smart.
The tats are nice, but probably won't take long
for someone to smell you're a cop, and mess you up.
You make going to jail sound very unappealing.
Now we need a safe word or a phrase
So we know you'll want to be extracted.
Pick something you'll remember if you're scared or stressed.
Not too common that you'd accidentally use it
in a regular prison conversation.
Walrus.
I had a cat named walrus.
I thought you hated cats.
Walrus is why.
There's only so much we can do without drawing
the wrong sort of attention your way, okay?
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
You're just trying to figure out who Kelly Wagner wants dead
so we can solve the biker murder.
That's all we need.
Check on ma, all right?
I will.
You be careful...
Or your mother won't be the only one who wants to smack you.
Thanks.
Just eggs.
Take a biscuit. They're good.
Very good.
No, thanks.
I'm not kidding. It's the only thing worth eating.
Nothing personal.
I'll have hers.
Thanks.
It's better if you don't watch people.
I agree.
How long you gonna be here?
I've got three months left on six.
Grand theft. Jewelry.
My whole career.
First time I ever got caught.
What'd you do?
You know what? They say I killed somebody.
And maybe I did or maybe I didn't,
but I'm willing to kill you and stay here if it'll shut you up.
So Korsak and Frankie looked into it.
Turns out there was an unsolved homicide involving a victim
who was stuffed into a dryer at a laundromat.
Did it match the same chemicals that we found on Endrit's shoes?
Exact same product profile.
Endrit made this mistake.
He might have made others.
Call upstairs and get the case files on any unsolved homicides
that fit this profile.
What profile?
Well, somebody stuffs you in a dryer,
they're looking to make a point.
It's not about the victim. He's already dead.
It's about the people who know the victim or who know you.
So theatrical murders?
It's one way to put it.
You got it.
Hi, Angela.
Hey, have you heard anything?
No. No, but I don't know that we will.
Yeah, unless there's a problem.
There's not going to be a problem.
Come on, we have to trust Jane to take care of herself.
Yeah, right.
You know, I remember when she was little, about 5-ish.
I was looking out the -- the kitchen window.
She was climbing up this stupid little tree that
that could barely hold a bird.
It was hard,
but I made myself stand there,
hoping that she'd realize it wasn't safe.
What happened?
She slipped. Fell about 10 feet.
By the time I ran out to the backyard,
she was chasing Frankie
and Tommy down the side of the house.
Am I always going to be this scared?
I was just looking for someone to talk to.
Yeah, okay.
You'd rather it not be you.
No offense.
God, this place sucks.
What kind of jewelry?
Excuse me?
What kind of jewelry did you steal?
The shiny kind.
I'm telling you for your own good,
you really need to stay out of other people's business.
Hey, I got gum -- - I have no money.
I got cigarettes. You gotta need something, girl.
What's your problem, you shit-brained little turd?
Oh, I bet you say that to everybody.
Hey, don't you walk away from me.
Back off!
What's going on?
Nothin'.
Absolutely nothin'.
Oh, you, too?
Skinny bitch.
Thanks.
She doesn't like to talk.
Well, I-I appreciate the help.
I'm only here for another day, and I didn't mean to help.
Three unsolved murders in the last two years
with interesting disposal characteristics --
hung from a lamppost, tied to the front of a truck,
Those qualify as theatrical.
We're trying to see if we can tie Endrit's crew to any of these.
Have you found anything to tie him to the bikers' murders?
No.
Maybe the Albanians had nothing to do with these killings.
Mm, too early to draw that conclusion.
But hung from a lamppost was killed with a shotgun.
That's the same as our biker murders.
What is it?
Oh. Just these two victims, they, uh,
both have industrial chemicals in their clothes,
Not laundry chemicals but...
No, but acids, alkalines, solvents.
The kind of things used in illegal activities.
Drug manufacture, bombs.
Yes.
So what if that's the unifying thread of our murders?
Industrial chemicals? Sale of, theft of.
We'll start trying to make those links. Thanks.
Korsak, have you heard from Jane?
No.
Let me know when you do.
I will.
Frankie.
So I've been thinking about what you said,
and I have a question.
If it had been the same situation
and Jane had been the one on the ground,
what would you have done?
I don't know.
I'll tell you -- the same thing.
You didn't shoot anybody. You protected me,
just...
just like you wish you could've protected Marcus.
You were just doing your job,
and maybe in the midst of it, you realized that...
you can really feel again
after a long time of being too scared to do that.
You didn't shoot anyone.
I didn't die.
So don't pull away, okay?
You gotta pee, do it somewhere else.
Oh, come on.
No, you come on.
You know what? You're too pretty for me to mess up.
How 'bout we be friends?
Get off me, man.
What, cowboy? There's nothing to see here.
What?
There a problem here?
No, uh...
There was some water. They slipped.
Get these women into the infirmary.
Let's take you, too.
What? No, I'm fine.
What about her?
Beats the shit out of me. I don't know.
Let's get 'em up, get 'em out of here.
Dr. Isles.
You are receiving a call
from an inmate at Suffolk County Jail.
Please press 1 to accept it.
Jane.
Hey. I-I couldn't reach Vince.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Do you need anything?
Can you come home?
What's the holdup on my hearing?
What?
Sorry. Um, no...
and no.
Okay, uh...
Uh, just, you know,
I'd like to get cleared, get the hell out of here, you know?
All right, this is like a bad game show.
But I get it. You can't talk freely.
So I will tell you what we know.
Okay, good.
It looks like we can tie the Albanians
to a number of open investigations.
But we haven't been able to tie them to the biker murders.
Okay. What about my girl?
Kelly?
Yeah.
We haven't found anything new.
All right, well, then I guess I'll have to work it out on my own.
Be careful. Be really careful, Jane. We're all --
Your call limit has been reached
and this connection is being terminated.
...really worried about you.
So you said you're not gonna be here very long?
My hearing's tomorrow.
Charges get dropped. Case falls apart. I'm a free woman.
You looking for work?
Yeah, I'm always looking to better myself.
'Cause I have something.
Well, spit it out, sweetheart.
I need someone...
taken care of.
You shittin' me?
No.
I've got $10,000.
I can get it to you once it's done.
How hard's the job?
He goes by Snake.
His real name is Jeff Morgan.
He's with the Lords of Thunder.
What did he do?
You want the job or not?
I'll think about it.
You know, I really liked my cat.
You did?
His name was Walrus.
Hey, I got your text.
I didn't wanna wake all of you up.
And I really, really needed a shower.
And...
I called Ma a few times. She hasn't picked up yet.
It's early.
That's quite a bruise.
It's nothing.
It will be in a couple of weeks, but right now,
it's a pretty nice bruise.
Yes, it is.
Your mom will call you back.
She's probably just... relieved that you're okay
and she needs a minute.
Yes, I'm sure that's it.
Well, it's hard to worry about our loved ones.
We always want to protect them.
You've certainly done plenty of that.
I have.
So did you get what you needed?
I did.
I have to get to work.
But we didn't finish our coffee.
I know. Come on. Come on, come on!
Oh, gosh.
Get the jacket. Jacket, jacket, jacket! Come on!
All right.
Wow, that's a big tattoo.
I know. I'm kinda starting to like it.
Um, when you were digging into Kelly's family,
did you find anything?
Nope.
Her parents died when she was in her teens.
She was in foster homes until she aged out of the system.
I think we missed something. Can you look again?
Okay.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're trying to kill him. I just wanna know why.
What the hell?
You did all this just to --
Kelly, we're just trying to help.
Shit. You don't know what you've done.
Okay, fine. Then tell us.
Come on, you putting a hit out on Snake?
That had zero chance of success. You know that.
And if you were just trying to protect yourself,
you could've ratted him out a lot sooner.
But you weren't trying to protect yourself,
were you, Kelly?
You were trying to protect your half-sister, Marley.
We'd do anything to protect our family, wouldn't we?
Especially when they can't protect themselves.
She was there, wasn't she?
She's the one who saw Snake kill Leo and Grimm.
Yes.
And now because of me, she's probably dead, too.
Did you find her?
No.
I took her out of that awful foster home she was in.
You know, I-I-I-I-I...
I should've gotten her out of Boston.
And Marley was sure that it was Snake?
She definitely said, "Snake hurt Leo."
I told her to meet me at our safe spot.
And I was out getting extra supplies
when you guys grabbed me.
Why have an exit strategy?
For something like this.
She was my responsibility.
What was she supposed to do if you didn't show up?
After three days, she knows to go to the police.
Well, she hasn't called, and she's not at the safe spot.
Which means either Snake got her
or she left 'cause she thought she was supposed to.
Why would she think that?
Oh, my god.
Was my cellphone at my apartment?
No.
No.
Snake probably found it when he was looking for her.
Her name isn't in it,
but eventually he'd figure out what number's hers.
All right, uh, write her number down, okay?
And -- and maybe we'll get lucky and find it.
Okay?
Jane.
Is she okay?
Is she okay?
Hi, doggy. What's your name?
Her name's Daisy.
Hi, Daisy. Hi. You're so cute.
Kelly!
I'm so happy to see you.
Thanks for letting me borrow your dog.
No problem. I'm okay. Are you okay?
It's pretty simple.
We'll provide you with a new home outside Boston,
help you get a job, and establish a new life.
What you have to do is
cooperate with our investigation
and abide by the laws of the Commonwealth.
Okay. Okay.
Some terrible people are going to be
off the streets because of you.
Hey, just wait for me right out in the hall, okay?
I'll be -- I'll be right out.
I-I-I-I-I wanted to -- to leave Leo, all of it,
and I -- and I couldn't figure out how.
Maybe I wasn't strong enough to figure it out.
So just...thank you.
Thank you so much...
for helping me take care of the only family I have.
Thank you.
You got this. Okay?
Thank you.
You got it.
We put together enough
to arrest Endrit and three of his associates.
Snake is being processed.
Several L.O.T.s picked up for gun trafficking.
All in all, a pretty fine day for the good guys.
That's nice.
See you.
Excuse me. Um, I'm looking for Detective "Rizilli"?
Thank you.
Detective "Rizilli"?
It's Rizzoli.
Jane.
Jane.
You got the D.A. to drop the charges against me.
Well, the fraud charges.
Yeah, well, people are more impressed
with jewel thieves, you know?
And, uh, those -- those, uh, fraud charges were bogus.
Mm. Even so, you got out because you helped me.
And I'm probably not gonna be there next time,
so, you know,
maybe you don't write checks you can't pay.
It's been a hard couple of years.
Well, here's my card.
If you ever need anything, you call me, okay?
I knew you didn't belong in Suffolk.
Oh, yeah? How's that?
It was the look in your eyes,
like you still had hope.
Thanks for helping me.
You're welcome.
And thanks for the tip about the biscuits.
They were good, yeah?
Yeah.
I've been calling you.
I know.
I'm glad you're okay.
Mostly.
Ma, it doesn't hurt. I promise.
I said some things I --
I'm not saying I think I was wrong, but...
Maybe I'm just not ready to talk about them yet.
I'm okay with that.
I love you, Ma.
I don't think she's mad.
She's scared, sad.
Why does it feel like everything is changing?
I mean, you're writing books.

The -- the instructor at Quantico?
It is. Okay, uh...
Well, I-I-I just have a few questions...
