You Aria?
Not now, Wes.
And that was?
That's Wesley. My brother.
How long have you known?
It's for you.
I don't know a James family in chicago.
Wasn't that Nate's real name?
And this is definitely Alison's handwriting.
"You need to tell the beach hottie tonight."
What are they talking about?
Who is the beach hottie?
Ali never told me.
Just tell me that there's more to this story...
That's there's something that I don't know.
Please, Toby!
I'm late.
Have you told him?
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.
Are you okay?
I'm about to meet my son.
What does this go to?
That's what I would like you to find out.
And if you follow him,
he'll lead you there.
Emily-- you did the right thing.
What's wrong?
Look who else was in Cape May.
Nothing?
Nothing since he left.
Well, he sent an "I got here" text.
Well, that counts...
If you want it to.
I mean, I know he's doing the right thing,
It's just the idea that something's happening
hundreds of miles away that's gonna change everything.
This is cold. I'm just gonna go get a refill.
Do you think Wilden read that notebook by now?
He must have.
So he knows what we know.
And what exactly do we know?
It's just Cece's version of things.
There was a picture of him in Cape Bay.
I'm going back to the police station after school,
take a snap of it on my phone.
Thanks.
Spencer.
Hey. Jason.
I've got some news.
We're keeping this kind of quiet.
But they've released Ali's remains to my family.
There's gonna be a re-interment.
She's being buried again?
Not in the ground. In the mausoleum.
There'll be a service, family only,
But I've arranged for you
guys to have some time after my parents leave.
Thank you.
There's someing else.
The things we put in the casket with Ali, they're still missing.
The state police think whoever opened the grave
is keeping them as some kind of sick souvenirs.
The cops figure when they find those,
they'll find the creeps who did this.
I think they're right.
Look, I just wanted you guys to hear it from me.
I'll text you when I know
the details about saying good-bye to Ali.
Don't bother. I've said all the good-byes I want to say.
Spencer.
What?
She's saint Ali now?
Are her bones fully relics or something?
You need to dial it back.
No, you dial it back.
I'm finished with all of this.
You guys want to pay a visit to the crypt keeper, that's fine,
It's your business, but keep me out of it!
We'll be there.
Me and you are the only ones
with something from Ali's casket.
I know.
So I say we get rid of them.
I'll ditch the ouija board thingie,
and then you chuck those earrings.
I'm not sure about that.
Not sure about what?
Every time we react to something like this,
it comes back to bite us on the ass.
It's like we're being
maneuvered into doing the absolute wrong thing.
I don't want to end up back in an orange jumpsuit again.
You think that I do?
Believe me, one size does not fit all.
So what do we do?
I'm gonna go to Ezra's apartment after school.
So we'll just talk later.
Why are you going to Ezra's?
Because I...water the plants, stuff like that.
Oh. And do you do that while wearing his shirt?
I'm going now.
Morning, Spencer.
Okay, someone's in a mood.
I just came by to remind
you that the decathlon's only a week away.
So in here is your schedule,
hotel information, practice questions,
and permission slip.
Look, Spencer...
I know this is a touchy subject,
But as team captain, I have to tell you
you've been off your a-game lately.
Yeah. This is the biggest competition of the year,
and I can't let your slip-and-slide affect the whole team.
Let me make something clear to you, Mona.
This is not a game to me-- at all.
Good. Because I'd hate to see poor Toby
travel all that way for you
only to be left cheering for me.
Caleb.
Hey. From my mom.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, she's fine,
It's just, uh...
I don't know, it's weird.
What is?
My aunt moved to Australia.
What's weird about that?
It's my father's sister.
The one my mom left me with.
The one who put you in foster care?
I guess my mom started looking for all of her broken connections,
and she finally found my aunt,
and my aunt is moving to Brisbane.
They're closing her house.
Wait. The one you were in when you were little?
Yeah. They're cleaning it out, tearing it down.
My mom said if I want to see the place,
see if I want anything from it,
I should... I should go now.
Are you thinking about going?
No. I'm not thinking about it, and I'm not going.
Caleb, if they tear it down.
I don't care.
Let 'em.
Hi.
Hi.
I, uh, I didn't know anyone would be here.
Is Ezra back?
No, he's not.
I was just checking on his place.
Oh. Come in.
Thanks.
Ezra said I could use the place if he was away.
You knew that he was gone.
He called me on his way to Delaware.
He was a little vague about
how he found out about Maggie and Malcolm.
It wasn't vague, it was messy.
But the point is, he found out.
I should have taken the hit.
No. It--
Look, he knows, he went there,
and now he's talking to her.
So, do we have a problem, me staying here for a couple of nights?
What? No.
Don't you have classes, though?
No. They're, uh, fumigating the dorms.
First time since the Clinton administration.
stay.
I mean, Ezra invited you.
That way I don't have to worry about the plants.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay. Well, I will get out of your way.
Maybe you should still check the plants.
I mean, I'm not too good about that. I once killed a cactus.
I thought the only way you could do that was with a gun.
Okay.
Yeah, um, I'll call before I stop by.
Bye.
Four days ago, the kid bought a sandwich,
tank of gas, and hydrangeas.
Hydrangeas?
Yeah.
Sixty-five dollars of hydrangeas.
You know this...?
I'm tracking his credit card.
Okay, what about three days ago?
Three days ago he switched to cash.
Someday he'll run out and I'll start tracking him again.
Do you want to hear about the key?
Yeah.
This wasn't easy, but I
traced the numerical code to the manufacturer,
manufacturer to a series of buildings on the west side of town...
And?
And if you want me to narrow it to a single doorway,
I'll need a bit more... encouragement.
You're wondering if it's worth it?
No. Not "It."
You.
Can I give you a piece of professional advice?
My line of work, the people I follow--
criminals, sumbags, lowlifes, all of 'em.
Okay, so?
So never once have any of those guys bought hydrangeas
before skipping town.
You let me know about the key.
Emily?
What are you doing here, honey?
I thought I'd see if you wanted me to grab something for dinner.
Oh! Yes, please. I had corn nuts for lunch.
From a vending machine?
Yeah.
I mistook it for actual food.
Like, say, corn or nuts?
I'm just gonna get my wallet.
You know what? Change of plans.
Let's just go out to dinner. I'll clock out early.
Are you sure that's okay?
What are they gonna do, arrest me?
Where did this come from?
Oh. Uh, that's mine. I left it on the counter this morning.
You must have put it in your bag by accident.
All right, well, let me go sign out.
I'll be right back.
He was gone.
Wilden read the notebook.
He knows we're on to him
What's happened?
So...
What exactly brings you to my office?
Look, I know you're in a funk, okay?
I was the first one to hear about your break-up.
And I didn't tell anyone until I knew you were ready.
I'm on your side here.
I know.
Is this what you left in Ali's casket?
That and twenty-four other postcards.
Someone put this in my mom's bag.
Aria thought it was bad
getting those earrings back one at a time--
"A" Has twenty-five opportunities to set me up.
Set us up.
Just because it's your memento
doesen't mean it can't be planted on any of us.
"A" is threatening to kill me if I go after Wilden.
Does that mean he murdered Ali?
Or that he's part of "A's" entourage?
That is not what this message says.
"La police" Are "Capable de murder."
I took french, Spencer.
For a semester.
"Arrete de creuser.
"La police sait deja que c'est toi
Qui est capable de meurtre."
Translation: "Stop digging.
"The police already know it's you
who is capable of murder."
Wow. That sounded so much better in french.
They mean Nate.
Look, you didn't do anything wrong.
Okay? Even the police know that.
Emily, that freak was gonna kill you and Paige.
Thank you for the french lesson.
I have to go to work soon, so....
Emily.
I meant to throw that out already.
That too.
I don't know what happened with you and Toby...
and I know you're not ready to talk about it.
But I am here for you. We're all here for you.
You can't just push us away that easily.
Last week Hanna saw Paige with another girl.
She assumed the worst.
She thought that Paige was seeing someone else.
She wasn't.
I talked to her, and she was trying to help us figure out
Who bought that queen of hearts costume on Halloween.
The girl that hanna was so worried about works at a costume shop.
She was a flirt, not a threat.
Did she find out who bought it?
Not yet.
The point is, sometimes things look bad, and they're really not.
Sometimes there's another explanation for what's going on.
And what if that explanation is even worse?
So what's he like? The brother.
He's all right. A little bit full of himself, though.
Is he cute?
He's kinda cute.
He's just way too comfortable
living off of his trust fund, though.
I would not mind getting cozy with one of those.
Trust fund.
Look, I gotta go. I gotta make Caleb dinner.
Huh-ho! So is that how you bribed
Caleb into going out to his aunt's house tomorrow?
A little. I just explained that
this might be his only chance to say good-bye.
Hey, give me the earrings. I'll take them tonight.
Um, I'm not ready to do that.
Well, you don't have to.
I'll get rid of them with the ouija board piece.
Okay, you can do whatever you want, but I'm gonna wait.
Look Aria, you're making a mistake.
Well, it's my mistake.
Is this a new couch?
It's a rental. Just about everything here is.
I wanted to make a fresh start in a new office.
I'm here until I find the right one.
I don't officially start seeing people until next week.
Well, thanks for letting me come in.
Mona's back at school.
Like you said, therapy and the right meds
and she'd be ready to rejoin society.
Did you come here to talk about Mona?
I came because...
Not talking isn't working.
You may have heard I killed a guy.
I heard that you and a classmate were attacked by someone,
The same person who killed Maya.
You were defending yourself, Emily.
What you did was incredibly--
Dr. Sullivan, no. That's not what I said.
That's not what I want to talk about.
Everyone wants to talk about how I'm some kind of hero.
Everyone tells me I--
I killed someone.
Someone had a life,
someone was a living, breathing person,
And I--
You killed someone.
I know what he was planning to do,
who he really was.
In my head, I know.
But then I close my eyes and I can see myself...
Holding that knife...
It was in my hand
and I can still feel what it felt like when it--
Emily, have you ever thought about trying hypnotherapy?
I remember what happened, Dr. Sullivan.
That's the problem-- I remember exactly what happened.
Hypnotherapy isn't just
about bringing back memories we've repressed.
Sometimes it's about reframing the ones we have,
the ones that are controlling our lives,
controlling the way we see ourselves.
How soon can we start?
Hello?
Hi. It's Spencer.
Um, how much more "encouragement" do you need?
Five hundred...
Cash.
Fine. Keep looking.
Just about everything here now.
You're looking at about a hundred years' worth of stuff.
Did you grow up here, Mr. Doyle?
Jamie. Yeah, I did.
My sister Patty, Caleb's aunt,
stayed and took care of
our folks when they got old. I was long gone.
And so was Caleb's dad?
Yeah. He was gone too.
Patty was surprised to hear from your mom.
Yeah, I bet she was.
Are you being rude on purpose?
I just don't want to be
here all day going through this crap, okay?
Well, at least look at the stuff before you throw it away.
How long has it been since you've seen your uncle?
A long time.
I only saw him like once or twice a year when I was a kid.
Took me to a few Phillies games.
That must have been nice.
He just felt guilty that his brother ran out on me.
That's a decent chunk of change.
The other girls are coming by the cemetery tonight around seven.
Sounds like a real party.
Hey, what is your problem, Spencer?
You got a prior engagement or something?
She was your best friend.
Look, if you got something to say, say it.
You don't want to have this fight with me, Jason.
Not now. I'll win, and it won't feel good for either of us.
No! Wait. You can donate these books to a library.
Come on, they're all moldy.
I used to love picture books. I might want to keep 'em.
Uh, if you happen to find Mike Mulligan's steam shovel in there,
I'll take it.
Deal.
He turned into a good-looking young man.
He treats you right?
He does.
Good.
Do you ever hear from his father?
Uh...Nobody does.
It's no great loss. He's not the sort of man people miss.
Caleb's never really talked about family much,
and then his mom found him,
and it kind of... changed things.
I'm glad she found him.
I've never met her. Did you know her?
Yes. Uh... She deserved better.
Most people deserve better than they get.
So you saw them together? Caleb's mom and dad.
Yeah.
Did they love each other?
Even for a little while?
I think so.
Then why would he leave them?
Yeah...He said he needed some space.
Figured he'd come back when he could handle being a dad.
The thing is, when you walk out, the people you leave...
They keep on having a life.
They don't wait for you to come back.
You're in a safe space, Emily.
No one can harm you here.
When I tell you to wake up, you will remember everything,
Then you will tell me what you remember.
Okay, wake up.
I want you to tell me everything that happened that night.
That night.
At the lighthouse.
You and your friend were in danger.
Are you there now?
Yes.
Good.
Hey. The plants have been calling out for you.
I know, I heard them crying for me
all the way down the hall.
Have you heard from him?
No. That doesn't mean he isn't thinking about you.
Yeah? What does it mean?
Are you gonna get that?
Probably just a junk call.
No, it could be Ezra. He knows that you're here.
Hello.
Wrong number.
Hey, you hungry?
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, come on. I need some air anyway.
Okay.
Tell me what you see.
I'm walking...
I don't know where I am.
It's dark...
really dark.
Take a look around, Emily. Do you see the lighthouse?
Someone just turned on the sprinklers.
Is there anyone else there with you?
I see her.
You see Paige?
She's looking at me. I think she knows she's gonna die.
We shouldn't be here.
This is bad. We shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, my god.
No! Please, no!
Tell me what you see.
I'd like to wake up now!
Emily, you're in a safe space. Tell me what you see.
I see...
the murder weapon.
You have to stop!
What do you think you're doing?!
You can't do this!
Stop! Stop!!!
Stop!!!
What happened?
You broke out of the hypnosis.
Do you remember what you saw?
You were talking about Nate, you saw the murder weapon,
and then you just started yelling.
Emily.
Emily!
Sorry. I have to go.
All right, I'm gonna put this stuff in the car and can we get going?
Bye, uncle Jamie.
Bye, Caleb.
Thank you, Mr. Doyle.
Or...Jamie.
Yeah.
You sure you kids don't wanna
go down the road, get a hamburger? I'm buying.
I think Caleb really wants to get going.
Right.
Hanna.
I found this over there, bottom of a dresser.
Look on the back.
"Caleb 6 months."
Yeah.
The way he's feeling, I'm not sure he'd want it right now,
so maybe you could hold onto it for him.
Just until he wants to see it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will. Thank you.
Hanna.
Um...I've gotta get going.
Yeah. You make sure he takes care of you.
Yeah, he will.
Hey, you've reached Hanna's phone. Leave a message.
We're supposed to be studying.
Are you planning a trip?
You and me and sweet Paree?
How does that sound?
Maybe we should learn how to parle fran?ais before we go.
Well, we could start in the south of France,
dancing through sunflower fields,
lounging around in our bikinis in the French Riviera.
You'd look so good on top of the Eiffel Tower...
wind in your hair...
How long are we going away for?
How about forever?
Hey. When'd you get back?
Uh, a little while ago.
Honey?
No. I can't let you do that.
Do what?
Act like I'm innocent.
Like I'm still the same sweet little girl that I've always been.
I'm not. I can't be.
Sweetheart, I know who you are,
and you would never
deliberately do anything to hurt another person.
I'm not so sure about that anymore.
Emily!
Emily, I am your mother,
And that means that I can see you, all of you,
Sometimes better than you can see yourself,
and there's only good there.
Look-- look at me!
I promise you, there's only good there.
It's a unit in a small building on Mayflower Hill.
What do you think's behind the door, Spencer?
I don't know.
Okay, what do you hope is behind the door?
We had a secret, him and me...
and this will tell me whether he kept it.
Did you ever play the game with the flowers when you were little,
"He loves me, he loves me not"?
He loves me, he loves me not...
the trick is, you just
find a flower with the odd number of petals.
Buttercups.
Marigolds.
How many petals are on a hydrangea?
So, you...
open the door, and...
I open the door,
and if it's full of the things that I think it is,
then it means that there's hope.
That means that he loves me,
and that I wasn't wrong about us.
And if not--
If not...
It's time to let him go.
Ezra taught me to drive when I was twelve.
He taught you to drive when you were twelve?
He said I should learn to do it right the first time.
Fitzgerald.
I been lookin' for you.
Your mother fixed the board, but she can't buy me off.
Mr. Kaplan, funny running into you like this.
Let's see that pretty smile
after I bounce your face off the curb.
Come on!
Wait. Wait.
Who the hell was that?
My physics teacher's husband.
What kind of school do you go to?
Why was the husband of your physics teacher trying to strangle you?
If you want to blame somebody,
you can blame my mother.
Oh, I'd love to,
But what exactly would I be blaming her for?
Ezra taught me how to drive,
but he never taught me how to get away from our family.
I thought you liked your world.
I thought so too.
When Ezra left home, our mom was furious. So was I.
It took me a long time to realize
I wasn't angry at him for leaving.
I was pissed because he didn't take me with him.
Why did you want to go with him?
Because he's not the only one with dreams.
But if I was gonna get free, I'd have to do it on my own.
So I thought getting thrown out of prep school
would be a good start.
If I failed enough courses, broke enough rules...
What happened?
My mother made every infraction disappear
with the wave of her checkbook.
Still brings us back to
the man that you hit with our leftover pizza.
Yeah, desperate times call for desperate measures.
I went for the one really crazy thing I knew
would cause maximum trouble.
You hit on your physics teacher.
Who is very attractive,
in an intellectual cougar sort of way.
Well, did it work?
Academic suspension and an irate husband.
That's why I'm hiding here.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Look, before Ezra, my family was as predictable as the tides.
One day Ezra just had enough and walked out.
My mom hurled lightning bolts, but he survived.
And more important, he found you.
He found you and said, "That's who I want."
You're the most amazing part of this.
That's why my mother hates you.
Why?
Because you're unexpected.
That was a day shot.
I don't really know what you were expecting.
Just thought that you could have a chance to...reconnect.
Well, silence your inner Oprah, okay? It's just an old house.
Your uncle was nice.
Yeah, I thought they were all nice,
until they shipped me off.
You could have asked him why they did that.
Some things you're better off not knowing.
I suppose.
Besides, it wasn't his call, okay?
Caleb...
If I show you something,
can you promise not to get angry?
That's you...
when you were a baby.
Where did you get this?
Your uncle Jamie gave it to me when we were leaving.
He wanted to make sure that you didn't throw it away.
Um...W-where was it?
In the shed someplace?
I don't think so.
You see how the edges are kind of bent?
I think he took it from his wallet.
Why would have a picture of me in his wallet?
I can think of a reason.
The man holding you...
That ring...
Jamie had the same ring on today.
He knew you before you were five.
Not a chance.
Dr. Sullivan!
I was hoping I'd catch you.
Mona, what are you doing here?
I heard you were reopening your practice,
so I thought I'd come by and give you this.
It's a housewarming present for the new office.
And I just wanted you to know that I'm doing so much better.
I'm glad to hear it.
Oh, what a cute little space!
I bet the orchid would look great on that windowsill.
I'm actually leaving for a few days,
so I will make sure it gets some water.
Good thinking.
It was very thoughtful of you, Mona.
Oh, it's nothing.
I could never really repay you for what you did.
Bye.
So shall we just wait, or...?
I'm pretty sure she's not coming.
"Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality."
That's creepy.
It's Emily Dickinson.
I don't care if it's Santa Claus, consider me creeped.
It's okay. It is a touch creepy in here.
My parents barely stayed two minutes.
Hey, you okay?
Spencer. You changed your mind.
No. I just knew that I could find you here.
I do have something to say to you.
Spencer.
Ali was pregnant when she died.
What?
What is she talking about? Is this true?
We can't know for sure. Emily looked it up,
and her early pregnancy wouldn't have shown up in an autopsy.
Isn't that right, Em?
You have no idea what you're saying right now.
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you know about this?
I mean, who would she have--
who's the father?
Oh, that's the best part.
Who, Spencer?
Spencer, don't.
I don't care!
Don't do this. Not here, Spencer.
Detective Wilden.
One of Rosewood's finest.
Please tell me this is part of some brilliant Spencer plan.
It's not.
She's just hurting and wants us to hurt just as bad.
We're your friends, we're not your punching bags.
Okay, so how are we gonna fix this? What are we telling Jason?
Forget Jason. There's something really wrong with Spencer.
I mean, this is bigger than Toby leaving.
I'm heartbroken too, but she just seems...
Broken.
It's one thing to doubt the person you're with--
if they ever loved you, if they didn't--
It's something else entirely when you start to doubt yourself.
Do you hear that?
You mean the sprinklers?
I heard it that night. Not in Ali's yard, at her grave.
I mixed up the nightmares.
We shouldn't be here.
This is bad. We shouldn't be doing this.
You have to stop!
What do you think you're doing?! You can't do this!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!!!
The girl-- the girl in the red coat.
It all happened right here.
I didn't hurt her.
Ali? Of course not.
Wait, so this was after
Jenna and Noel picked you up from the diner?
I don't know. It could have been before.
I know this sounds ridiculous, but someone has to ask--
Do you think it was Alison in the red coat?
Alison digging up her own grave?
I said it was ridiculous.
And you were right.
All I know is that it was a woman,
she was blond, and she was wearing a red coat.
And...
What?
She's the one in charge.
慈爱的母亲

Hey, Dave.
Make sure you see an I.D.
I'll get the rest of this order on the loading dock.
