vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon ,
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
elijah .
one of the originals .
he &apos;s a legend .
klaus is the real deal .
you &apos;re saying that the oldest vampire
in the history of time is coming after me ?
i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
i need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed .
then i shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed .
i called isobel .
did you find her ?
not exactly .
hello , elena .
uncle john .
bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire .
so don &apos;t be his friend .
do you understand me ?
i &apos;m jules .
i know you &apos;re a werewolf .
do you know where mason is ?
he &apos;s dead , tyler .
you want to know who murdered him ?
your little , blond vampire did .
caroline would never do that .
she and her little vampire friends were behind it .
how &apos;s it going ?
we need to talk .
yeah . we do . listen .
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
and i don &apos;t want to overanalyze .
it was just one kiss ,
but matt is still kind of in the picture .
we can &apos;t go there , tyler .
fine .
great .
that &apos;s settled .
what happened to my uncle mason ?
what ?
he &apos;s dead , and i want you to tell me what happened .
tyler , i don &apos;t--
then let me tell you .
stefan and his brother damon killed him
because stefan and damon are vampires ,
just like you .
who told you that ?
is it true ?
let me explain .
did you know he was dead this whole time ?
please--
did you know ?
i &apos;m sorry , tyler . i &apos;m sorry .
i trusted you .
i--
the sheriff &apos;s department believes drugs
played a part in the assailant &apos;s deranged and violent behavior
that left 3 people dead at last night &apos;s
booster club dinner at a local high school .
the authorities believe last night &apos;s assailant
may also be link to the missing campers
and park ranger who have yet to be found
as well as 25 @-@ year @-@ old jessica konig ,
reported missing this morning .
the sheriff &apos;s department says investigations are pending
and no further comment will be made .
in related news , mayor lockwood spoke earlier today .
due to the recent tragedies that have plagued our town ,
we will be holding a memorial in town square today
to honor all those we have lost .
join us in hopes that as a community ,
we can begin to heal .
morning .
what are you doing here ?
coffee ?
we &apos;re not doing that .
we did that last night . no more avoiding .
why are you here ?
here to protect you .
that &apos;s all i can say for the moment .
what do you mean , that &apos;s all you can say ?
i &apos;ll tell you more when i &apos;m convinced i can trust you .
oh , god , i &apos;m late .
that &apos;s what you get for hitting the snooze 3 times .
what the hell ?
hey , good morning to you , jenna . alaric .
it &apos;s ok i &apos;m confused , right ?
because we were not expecting you , like , ever .
well , i got in late last night . elena let me in .
you know , i &apos;m probably just gonna take off .
i &apos;m still confused here .
i decided to come back and stay for a while .
not here , you &apos;re not .
actually , you can &apos;t stop me from living here .
actually , i can as legal guardian .
yeah . about that ,
elena , you want me to explain the situation ,
or would you like to do the honors ?
ok . what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry , jenna .
i should &apos;ve told you earlier , but--
i &apos;m elena &apos;s biological father .
there . now you know .
what ?
you brought back john gilbert ?
that was your big save @-@ elena move ?
i went to go look for isobel , and i got john instead .
he said he could help us ,
and we &apos;re desperate .
we &apos;re not that desperate , stefan .
the guy tried to barbeque me .
damon , bonnie &apos;s new witch friend is working with elijah ,
so we have to assume that the moonstone was never destroyed .
elena is putting all of her faith
into some deal that she made
with elijah to keep everyone safe .
i mean , do you trust elijah ?
i don &apos;t trust him . he &apos;s an original . he can &apos;t be trusted .
it &apos;s not like we can just go up and kill him
because apparently , he can &apos;t die .
still waiting for the part where john gilbert is the answer .
he knew about the sacrifice .
isobel told him .
he said he knew of a way to keep elena safe .
and how do we do that ?
he &apos;s not talking , at least not to me , anyway .
great work , stefan , top notch .
as if i didn &apos;t have enough problems .
hey , i &apos;m sorry about rose .
whatever .
i knew the woman for 5 minutes .
and you cared about her after 5 minutes .
oh , wonder what that means .
it means i care , stefan .
it means i &apos;m changing and evolving into a man
capable of greatness .
you better watch your back
because i may just have to go get a hero hairdo of my own
and steal your thunder .
i got it , mom .
what &apos;s wrong ?
tyler knows about you and damon .
he knows that damon killed mason .
i didn &apos;t say a word .
it &apos;s that woman jules . she had a run @-@ in with damon .
tyler was so upset .
the look on his face , he was so betrayed .
wow , this is bad .
you &apos;re not gonna tell damon , are you ?
no.we hear that he wants to kill him .
he thinks all werewolves should die ,
and he &apos;s not wrong to think that , caroline .
i mean , what if tyler tries to retaliate ?
he has every right to . he can get himself killed .
well , we &apos;re not gonna let that happen .
yeah . we have to get to him and reason with him
before he does something stupid .
you have to talk to him .
just try to explain , you know ?
you always know the right things to say , ok ?
he and i ... we &apos;re friends .
i was right , wasn &apos;t i ?
your little vampire friend , she was lying .
what do you want ?
i want you to understand that a vampire
will never be your friend .
it &apos;s our nature to be enemies .
you know how stupid that sounds ?
you need to leave here . it &apos;s not safe .
i can &apos;t just run away with you .
i don &apos;t even know you . my mom would freak .
my life is here .
your old life .
your new life is just beginning .
you have so much to learn .
like what ?
how to survive .
you &apos;ve triggered the curse , tyler .
it &apos;s important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope .
we live by a code of loyalty .
we take care of each other .
it &apos;s my duty and honor to help you .
please let me .
where &apos;s john ?
he &apos;s not here . he left .
i don &apos;t know where he went .
he just blew in , announced to jenna
that he &apos;s my dad , and then took off .
it &apos;s public knowledge now ?
apparently .
you ok ?
yeah .
jenna &apos;s head is spinning , but i &apos;m ok .
he say what he was doing here ?
no . you know , stefan thinks that he &apos;s telling the truth
about wanting to help me .
you believe him ?
no . i don &apos;t believe him for a second .
i don &apos;t , either .
want are we gonna do ?
kill him .
damon
i &apos;m joking .
ok . i &apos;m a little serious .
damon !
i &apos;m not gonna hurt him , elena .
i &apos;m the good guy now , remember ?
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m gonna have a civil conversation with your father .
wait . i &apos;m coming with you .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you . i just want to talk .
then why did you break in ?
would you have let me in otherwise ?
tyler ?
shh . not a word .
tyler , i &apos;m leaving for the memorial .
brady ?
this is a hard place to find .
you told me to stay under the radar .
thanks for coming .
you sure these vamps killed mason ?
positive .
we have to be careful .
i &apos;m not afraid of a vampire .
i know , baby , but i want the boy
more than i want vengeance .
i say , let &apos;s get both .
maybe we &apos;re getting off on the wrong foot here .
what happened to mason ?
tyler , there &apos;s a lot for us to talk about .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
without a full moon , you &apos;re no match for me .
it &apos;s good to have you back , john .
we could really use you .
and the council ? what are they doing ?
damon salvatore is leading the council now .
talk to him .
excuse me .
jeremy , there you are .
looks like i slept through the homecoming .
you didn &apos;t miss much .
to say that no one is happy to see me would be an understatement .
things are different now .
you can &apos;t come around and
start up with all this antivampire stuff .
i have no intention of doing that .
how &apos;s that ring been treating you ?
look . if this is what you came for ,
just take it and go .
what kind of man would i be if i took that from you ?
want to go grab some lunch ?
think i &apos;ll pass .
all right .
hello , bonnie .
i don &apos;t have anything to say to you , dr. martin ,
or your son .
you must be feeling very confused about us .
nothing confusing about it .
i trusted luka , and he betrayed me .
elena told me you &apos;re both working for elijah ,
so don &apos;t lie about it .
i won &apos;t , but that doesn &apos;t mean
we &apos;re not also looking out for you .
spare me the witch loyalty crap .
you might not want to believe this ,
but elijah is a man of his word .
you can trust that he &apos;ll keep his end of the deal
with elena to keep you and your friends protected .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t believe it .
is there a problem here ?
not at all .
what was that about ?
more lies .
i can &apos;t believe it .
elena is my sister &apos;s husband &apos;s brother &apos;s daughter ,
and her mother is my boyfriend &apos;s deceased wife .
you can &apos;t make this stuff up .
it &apos;s definitely a little overwhelming .
i can &apos;t believe that they kept it a secret .
how it is even possible to keep a secret like that ?
hey , you two .
you think i can join you ?
do you have to ?
i guess i don &apos;t have to , but might as well .
look who &apos;s here .
we just need answers .
please don &apos;t do anything stupid .
yeah , but stupid is so much more fun .
damon , i mean it .
all i &apos;m asking is you try to keep it together .
be the better man .
ok , then .
john , buddy ... how you been ?
i &apos;ve been all right , damon .
it &apos;s good to see you .
look . about caroline ,
no matter what her flaws are ,
when push comes to shove ,
you &apos;re gonna want that girl on your side .
she &apos;s your friend . stop being a dick to her .
i thought vampires hated werewolves .
that &apos;s some sort of leftover idea from another time .
doesn &apos;t have to be that way anymore .
we go to the same school . we have the same friends .
we keep the same secrets . this can work , tyler .
i mean , it &apos;s your home . it &apos;s my home , too .
i want this to work .
help . help .
whose number was that , hmm ?
damn it , tyler .
i &apos;m trying to save your life . can &apos;t you see that ?
we have a problem .
so , john , rumor has it ,
you know a lot and won &apos;t say anything .
how do i know you can be trusted , damon ?
originals can compel vampires ,
according to stefan .
that &apos;s why katherine is still in the tomb ,
because an original has compelled her to stay there .
only because all of the vervain had left her system .
stefan and i , on the other hand ,
are chock full .
you guys are drinking vervain ?
it &apos;s an acquired taste .
i don &apos;t see that magical ring on your stitched finger ,
so if you know something about klaus ,
you better start talking ,
or i will kill you in your sleep .
now , is that any way to convince me
that you and i are on the same side ?
first , i need to know that i can trust you , damon ,
that i can count on you .
then we &apos;ll talk .
i haven &apos;t seen you .
i &apos;m not avoiding you , i swear .
yeah . you &apos;re avoiding me a little .
ok , maybe a little .
can we talk later ?
i mean , i &apos;m headed to work right now , but maybe after ,
clear up some of this weirdness ?
yeah . yeah . i &apos;d really like that .
i &apos;ll just swing by when you &apos;re closing .
sounds good .
ok . bye .
excuse me .
caroline , right ?
yeah .
i &apos;m looking for tyler .
you haven &apos;t seen him , have you ?
no , not since earlier .
sorry .
i know you &apos;re lying .
really ? how ?
is that one of your little wolf tricks ?
actually , it is .
well , i have a trick , too .
i see you got the bullet out .
that was nasty .
i got lots of wooden bullets ,
other toys .
it &apos;s gonna be a long night , sweet pea .
you want to be friends , great .
we &apos;re friends . will you go now ?
i don &apos;t know what else to say to you , tyler .
i came back to this town because i wanted a life .
i wanted to exist where i could have friends
and where i could build a family .
i have that here . we can both have that .
hi . everything ok ?
that depends .
how badly do you want to keep her alive ?
who is this ?
ask your brother . where &apos;s tyler ?
jules ?
where &apos;s caroline ?
you made a mistake , stefan .
i &apos;m gonna give you a chance to fix it .
where is she ?
right here . want proof ?
he needs proof .
what &apos;s happening ?
hurt her again , and you &apos;re dead .
i hurt her again , and she &apos;s dead .
bring tyler to me , clearing by wickery falls .
you have 20 minutes until she dies .
so my friend wants to meet you .
damon salvatore , this is--
i know you-- the news lady .
yeah , andie star . nice to meet you .
can i buy you a drink , damon ?
my glass is all full , andie .
thank you .
you totally blew her off .
i &apos;m steering clear of all women at the moment .
you didn &apos;t have to be rude .
trust me , it &apos;s in the best interest of women everywhere .
stefan ?
what is it ?
why am i just finding out about this now ?
stefan was worried that you--
that i would what , what i would kill him ?
of course . that &apos;s what needs to happen .
no , damon , not tyler .
do whatever you need to do to get caroline back ,
but just leave tyler out of it , ok ? - why ?
he &apos;s a werewolf . he needs to die .
i &apos;m willing to kill . it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
damon , please , ok ? too many people are dead .
you need to stop doing that .
doing what ?
assuming that i &apos;ll play the good guy
because it &apos;s you who &apos;s asking .
be the better man , damon .
do you mind ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
doesn &apos;t look like nothing .
well , guess what , john .
trust works both ways . get out .
look . we don &apos;t have time for this .
we need to get caroline back .
we don &apos;t need to do anything . i &apos;ll take care of it .
first dad duty-- ground your daughter .
keep her here .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m with damon on this one .
uh @-@ uh . nope . stop , stop . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
just tell me what &apos;s going on .
so ...
how many vampires are there in this town anyway ?
no ?
why are you doing this to me ?
why are you doing this to me ? why ?
you &apos;re a vampire .
why not ?
i &apos;m sorry . what was that ?
get me out !
excuse me ? what was that ?
let me out !
get it out of your system ?
no . i &apos;m just getting started .
brady , let &apos;s be smart about this .
i just want the boy .
it &apos;s our duty to help him . it &apos;s who we are .
you want to talk duty and honor ?
these are vampires .
they cross one of us , they cross all of us .
that &apos;s who we are .
you &apos;re not leaving this restaurant .
you can &apos;t tell me what to do .
yes , i can . want to know why ?
because i &apos;m here to make sure you stay safe .
i &apos;ve got that covered .
are you talking about the deal that you made with elijah ?
you really think he &apos;s gonna keep his promise to you ?
putting your faith in him was a dumb move .
are you saying i should put my faith in you ?
after everything that you did to stefan and damon ?
we &apos;ve had our differences ,
and i &apos;ve made mistakes ,
but you and i , we &apos;re family .
you don &apos;t get to use that word .
that word is off limits to you .
fine , but it doesn &apos;t change the facts .
you &apos;re right . facts are facts ,
so listen up . you may be my father ,
but i am never going to be your daughter .
you got that ?
i know you &apos;re out there .
where &apos;s caroline ?
locked up tight .
let her go and i &apos;ll release tyler .
it doesn &apos;t have to get any messier than it already has .
i &apos;m not your enemy , jules .
it &apos;s a little late to be waving a white flag ,
don &apos;t you think ?
you need to leave town .
no one else has to get hurt .
i &apos;m not leaving without tyler .
tyler &apos;s free to make his own decisions .
as soon as you release caroline .
my brother the peacemaker .
since stefan got here before me ,
i &apos;m gonna let him try it his way
before i resort to my way ,
which is a little bloodier .
so give us caroline .
let go of tyler .
give us caroline . light of full moon .
it &apos;s not an even fight and you know it .
we &apos;ll take you .
i &apos;m not so sure about that , tough guy .
let &apos;s try this again .
give us tyler .
you heard her . go .
which one of you killed mason ?
uh , that &apos;d be me .
boys , make sure that one suffers .
we can take them .
i don &apos;t know about that .
well , then ...
tyler ! there &apos;s a latch .
there &apos;s a latch on the door and i can &apos;t get to it .
tyler ?
tyler , please . tyler ?
what &apos;s happening ?
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
elijah made a promise to elena .
i &apos;m here to see it &apos;s upheld .
you need to go .
get out of here . now .
when your friends awaken , give them a message .
they need to get the hell out of this town .
so is your mom home ?
no . she &apos;s at work .
i can come in if you want me to .
i &apos;m fine , stefan .
you don &apos;t have to pretend with me .
anybody would be upset after
what you went through tonight .
i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m not girlie , little caroline anymore .
i can handle myself .
you sure can .
i just really want to go shower , so ...
ok .
ok
good night .
what do you want ?
we didn &apos;t finish our conversation .
i &apos;ll bite .
i &apos;ve been thinking . personal feelings aside , damon ,
i think you and stefan
will do all you can to protect elena .
i agree with that statement .
so i come bearing gifts .
what the hell is that ?
this is how you kill an original .
in this vial is ash from a white oak tree
that dates back to the genesis of the originals .
the dagger must be dipped into the ash
and then plunged into their heart .
how do you know all this , john ?
isobel . she &apos;s very good at finding out things .
but of course you know that .
where is isobel ?
let &apos;s just say if she accomplishes what she &apos;s attempting ,
klaus will never set foot in mystic falls .
where elena &apos;s concerned ,
you and i are on the same side .
hey . did something happen ?
oh , my ... i am so sorry , matt .
are you ok ?
yeah .
something came up with bonnie
and she needed me .
a friend thing . you understand ?
yeah . so you with her right now ?
yeah . so i &apos;m not gonna make it tonight ,
but can i see you tomorrow ?
yeah . sure . i hope everything works out .
good night .
good night .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
i had no idea they would come for you .
do you know what they did to me ?
i &apos;m sorry . but it &apos;s crazy now .
ok ? i don &apos;t know who to trust .
you lied to me .
i lied to protect my friends .
i lied to protect you . don &apos;t you get that ?
caroline
you just stood there
when they were going to kill us .
you just stood there . you didn &apos;t do anything .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
you help your friend . that &apos;s what you do .
i &apos;m sorry . no , it &apos;s too late .
because we &apos;re not friends anymore .
and what happened to me tonight ,
that will never happen again .
so you take that back to your little werewolf pack
and you get the hell out of my house .
i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
enough already . i don &apos;t want you here
and i can &apos;t make that any more clear .
i didn &apos;t come here to fight with you , elena .
yeah , i know . you &apos;re here to protect me .
got it . get in line .
i thought you might want this .
it was your mother &apos;s .
isobel ?
no .
your mother . miranda .
i remember her wearing it when she was young .
i found it in a box with some things that your dad left me .
here . it &apos;s yours now .
miranda and grayson were your parents , elena .
i know i &apos;m nothing to you .
you have no reason to believe me or trust me .
i &apos;ve done so many horrible things .
but when you lost your parents ...
i lost my brother , my family .
i lost my way .
i know i &apos;m probably never
going to make things right with you .
i know that , but ...
i &apos;m gonna do everything i can to protect you
and protect this family .
elena ?
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
did you hear that ?
i don &apos;t believe him , stefan .
i just don &apos;t .
what happened tonight ? how &apos;s caroline ?
i could use your help .
hey . come on in .
i &apos;m sorry about your friends .
it &apos;s not always like this . is it ?
no . is it , brady ?
no , man .
you &apos;re living in vampire country , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s way better than this .
mason didn &apos;t tell me anything about it .
he was gone . dead , i guess ,
before he could help me .
i don &apos;t get what mason was even doing here
in the first place .
his brother died . you know that , brady
why was he stupid enough to stay
and get himself killed ?
because of this rock he was trying to find .
what rock ?
a moonstone .
i had no idea .
what ?
moonstone ? did he find it ?
yeah . where is it now ?
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
what &apos;s going on ? i was a bit worried about you .
after everything you went through tonight .
i &apos;m fine .
good . but just in case , i ...
brought some backup .
we &apos;re gonna slumber it .
we haven &apos;t done it in ages .
i love you .
i love you .
i can &apos;t believe you called me .
i thought i was being way too forward
when i had jenna give you my number .
i like a woman who knows what she wants .
thank you .
so what do you want ,
mr. tall , dark , and handsome ?
i &apos;m not that tall .
i need a distraction .
you can booty call me anytime you want .
see , the thing is , miss sexy reporter girl ,
i have a problem i need help with .
it &apos;s really messing with my mind .
oh . tell me about it .
i &apos;m in love with a woman i can never have .
i knew it .
i know how to pick them .
so why can &apos;t you have her ?
she &apos;s with another man , i assume ?
yeah , that &apos;s not the point .
the point is i &apos;m in love with her
and it &apos;s driving me crazy .
i &apos;m not in control .
you don &apos;t trust yourself around her ?
i don &apos;t trust myself around anyone , andie .
i &apos;m bad , andie . i do things .
i kill people .
don &apos;t be afraid .
you &apos;re ok .
why do you kill people ?
because i like it .
it &apos;s in my nature . it &apos;s who i am .
but then i have to stay together to protect her
and she wants me to be the better man ,
which means i can &apos;t be who i am .
do you see the problem i &apos;m having , andie ?
well , maybe this is who you are now .
love does that , damon . it changes us .
just stop talking .
just kiss me .
be my distraction .
i know you &apos;re expecting someone else .
i sent stefan to find isobel .
she got your message . she was busy ,
so she sent me instead .
does stefan know that you &apos;re here right now ?
no . no one does .
this is between you , me , and isobel .
i want out of this tomb , john .
