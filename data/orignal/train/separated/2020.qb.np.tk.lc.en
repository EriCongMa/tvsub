i &apos;m bonding with your father here .
speaking of which--
you &apos;re not taking it easy on me , are you ?
a little .
you mean something to me .
you &apos;ve always meant something to me ,
and you always will mean something to me .
what do you need , harvey ?
ava hessington .
i am not losing to him .
you ... your blood feud
or whatever it is you have with that man
is what put the target on my back in the first place .
i made this mess . it &apos;s up to me to clear it up .
harvey and cameron made a deal to take you down ,
and part of that deal was that
i got to be the one to tell you about it .
and if he can &apos;t practice law in the country ,
he can &apos;t be a member of our firm .
you set this whole thing up .
jessica set this whole thing up .
and , edward ...
we may be getting a divorce ,
but i fully intend on keeping ownership of the house .
oh , come on , just because i have to wake up early
doesn &apos;t mean you should suffer .
well , you know what they say .
the couple that wakes together ...
bakes together ?
stays together .
yeah , that doesn &apos;t rhyme .
you &apos;re ridiculous .
oh , my god . that &apos;s amazing .
i know .
you &apos;re amazing .
i know .
you have no intention of letting me go to work , do you ?
there once was a girl from nantucket .
i love you .
oh , that doesn &apos;t rhyme , you know ?
what are you , the rhyming police now ?
you started it .
and i &apos;m gonna finish it .
i love you too .
you look happier than you did last night .
i am .
what are you doing here ?
i was thinking i &apos;d give you a ride .
you just gave me a ride last night .
yeah , this time i thought i &apos;d join you .
harvey , we put in 15 @-@ hour days
12 feet from each other .
you really want to go to work together ?
who said anything about work ?
we have breakfast at nougatine
and an excursion to hermes that may or may not
involve a new handbag .
you &apos;ve been needing a new handbag .
you can never have too many handbags .
you &apos;re a woman after my own heart .
well , in that case ...
harvey ... why are you doing this ?
donna , we &apos;ve all been through a lot .
we deserve a little celebration .
well , in that case , you have had it pretty rough .
we &apos;re gonna need to get you more than one handbag .
i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
jessica .
louis , what can i do for you ?
actually , i &apos;m not here about me .
i &apos;m here about you .
how so ?
i want to handle the dissolution .
so this is about you .
no . jessica ...
i got ava out when you wanted her out .
i proved that i will do whatever it takes .
and what &apos;s more , i know darby &apos;s assets ,
and i will get you everything that you have coming .
i can get everything i have coming .
maybe , but after what stephen huntley
and edward darby did , you want to exact a pound of flesh .
you want to kill them both .
what &apos;s your point ?
my point is , is that you go into that room angry ,
you &apos;re gonna have blinders on .
and they &apos;re gonna lead you any way they want you to go .
i get in that room , i &apos;m cool as a cucumber ,
and i will lead whatever way you want to go .
we just got edward darby &apos;s proposed formula
for splitting our assets .
son of a bitch .
i know !
he thinks he can dictate terms after what he &apos;s done ?
we need to crush him .
see ? blinders .
what ?
louis was just suggesting that he run the negotiations .
louis also suggested the firm adopt a badger as a mascot .
the badger is a noble and fearsome creature ,
but that &apos;s not the point . i can beat them .
and the washington generals think they can beat
the globetrotters , but they &apos;re not even
in the same league .
my father played for the washington generals .
see ?
so what are you saying ?
i &apos;m not in your league ?
i &apos;m saying you and i
don &apos;t even play the same sport .
harvey ... enough . and louis has a point .
you seriously want to consider this ?
this is a joke .
louis , will you give us a moment ?
please ?
i am not a joke .
you can &apos;t do that anymore .
you mean make fun of louis ?
it &apos;s one of life &apos;s great pleasures .
when the two of you were colleagues ,
that &apos;s fair game , but you &apos;re a name partner now ,
and you have to show him some respect .
i am showing him respect .
i &apos;m being dismissive to his face .
harvey , remember kopelman ?
comb @-@ overs like that are hard to forget .
when i first started here , he and i would fight
like cats and dogs every day , toe @-@ to @-@ toe .
then one day he went too far .
he crossed a line , and i &apos;d had enough ,
and i went in , and i ripped him up .
you know what i did the day after daniel and i
took over the firm ?
i went to kopelman , and i told him how much i valued him .
kopelman never voted against you
the whole time i knew him .
exactly .
and by the way , louis is right .
jessica , it &apos;s one thing for me to show louis respect .
but you want to put me on the sidelines for him ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna put him in at quarterback ,
then snap the ball to you .
so let me get this straight .
you want to go afte their clients
so we get to count those revenues .
whoever has more revenue is gonna determine
who gets what at the time of closing .
louis locks in the settlement terms
while we tip the basis for the settlement .
exactly .
some might say that &apos;s negotiating in bad faith .
and i say darby wasn &apos;t above board when we got married .
why should we be above board when we &apos;re getting divorced ?
and until the settlement is done ,
it &apos;s not stealing clients .
it &apos;s shifting the attorney of record .
wait a minute . did you think of this all by yourself ?
why wouldn &apos;t i think of this all by myself ?
it was jessica , wasn &apos;t it ?
she thought of it all by yourself .
the important thing right now is to decide
which client to go after .
and to avoid my question about whose idea it was .
exactly .
okay .
well , if it &apos;s going to affect the settlement calculations ,
we &apos;re gonna need a big client and we &apos;re gonna need a big one
who just took a loss .
not necessarily .
you know who cries hardest in the miss america pageant ?
the runner @-@ up .
the winner ...
because she knows she can &apos;t win again ,
and winners always want to win more .
yeah . that &apos;s not why they cry .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
stay with me .
what we need is a huge company that is still looking
to keep the crown .
samsung .
get it going .
yeah .
wait . do you-- you actually watch
the miss america pageant ?
no , but i &apos;ve celebrated with the winner .
texas , florida , new york ?
california .
now , there &apos;s a question you didn &apos;t want to avoid .
exactly .
you wanted to see me ?
yes , and it &apos;s important .
what can i do for you ?
adjust the font on the new business cards ?
order some pens ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we don &apos;t have any pens ,
what would you sign the order with ?
what do you want , jessica ?
i was just making a little joke .
oh , i thought i was the only joke around here .
louis , you are no joke .
and you &apos;re right .
you have been on the sidelines far too long .
i want you to handle the negotiations .
you won &apos;t be sorry .
you want a pound of flesh ,
i &apos;m gonna bring you the whole carcass .
i believe you would ,
but i &apos;m going to ask you to do something else .
anything you need .
i need you to be fair .
fair ?
yes , fair .
that &apos;s one way to go .
it &apos;s the way to go ...
because i need them to think that we &apos;re moving on ,
when , in fact , we &apos;re going after their clients .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
you and harvey are letting me in on one of your missions ?
this is litt @-@ tastic .
louis , calm down .
calm down ? no !
this is just like the great escape .
you &apos;re recruiting me to go behind enemy lines .
i &apos;m steve mcqueen .
you know the great escape ?
are you kidding ?
charles bronson grew up in my grandmother &apos;s shtetl .
then you know steve mcqueen was the cooler king .
louis , i need you to be my cooler king .
yeah , i am cool .
so you &apos;re authorizing me to sign on your behalf ?
yes , but under no circumstances
are you to lock in the existing client allocations .
please , i &apos;d die before that happens .
let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t come to that .
is that coconut water ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
i took some with me this morning .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
why would i mind ? you needed the hydration .
you made me need the hydration .
you &apos;re welcome .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
i just don &apos;t like when you drink
from the bottles in the refrigerator .
but it &apos;s my bottle .
the ones in my fridge aren &apos;t .
so you do mind that i took it .
no , i mind that you drink from the bottles in my fridge .
okay .
and that you left your coffee mug in the sink again .
i thought i was supposed to put the mug in the sink .
yes , on the right side . the left side is for rinsing .
i can &apos;t rinse if there are dishes piled on both sides .
i &apos;ll try and remember that .
you &apos;d think a guy with your memory wouldn &apos;t have to try .
all right , let &apos;s hear it .
hear what ?
the list .
what list ?
of things i do that annoy you .
i don &apos;t have a list .
everyone has a list .
do you have a list ?
this isn &apos;t about my list .
this is about your list .
no , it &apos;s about yours because i just told you
everything that &apos;s on mine .
you &apos;re telling me that the most meticulous woman
on the upper west side only has a list of two ?
that &apos;s not fair .
no , what &apos;s not fair
is you making this all about me .
i might not be perfect , but neither are you .
so , excuse me , i have more important things to do
than talk about where i left my coffee cup .
fair ?
fair .
fair ?
yes , fair .
i didn &apos;t even like playing nice in the sandbox .
someone has better sand toys ,
you take &apos; em .
exactly .
and you don &apos;t ask bolshoi ballerinas to dance the tango .
that would indeed be blasphemy .
if jessica wants compromise ,
she should hire a mediator , not a gladiator .
except jessica doesn &apos;t want compromise .
she wants a stone @-@ cold killer to do one thing and one thing only .
and what is that ?
not to lock client allocations till harvey lands samsung .
then give me an order .
your order is to not let my inner gladiator
get past my outer negotiator .
that &apos;s not gonna be easy , louis .
you &apos;re like the hulk-- once you get enraged ,
there &apos;s no going back .
though your description of both my temperament
and physique is accurate , the one thing that i have
on my side is that i have no personal animus
against the other side .
nesbitt .
litt .
i see you &apos;re wearing your checkered suit
with your crimson power tie .
you see correctly .
looks like you came to play hardball .
i didn &apos;t come to play anything .
i came to win .
well , i &apos;m not here to win .
i &apos;m here to make sure we hammer out a fair agreement .
and to help you achieve that ,
i see you &apos;ve brought along tinker bell .
and you were so scared of tinker bell ,
you sent her to barcelona
for your cat trial .
during which time ,
she worked closely with a different senior partner ...
again and again .
don &apos;t worry .
dr. banner &apos;s not turning green today .
see , whatever you thought
was gonna happen to me here isn &apos;t .
so go ahead , wind me up all you want ,
&apos;cause i ain &apos;t losing my cool .
fine .
this is my initial proposal .
those are letters i wrote to mikado .
unopened .
you never read them to her ?
not a single word .
you son of a bitch .
you think you can rattle me ?
i &apos;m un @-@ rattleable .
really ?
this portrait that you sent her .
get out !
louis--
i said go .
oh , yeah , you and i are going to war .
everything &apos;s on the goddamn table !
including the existing client list allocations ?
did you hear what i just said ?
i said everything !
you son of a bitch .
you knew i &apos;d come after samsung .
i knew what suit you &apos;d be wearing .
i know tiger woods wears red on sundays .
it doesn &apos;t mean i can beat him .
i &apos;m not going to let you poach our clients , harvey .
you poaching our clients
is what led us to this goddamn merger in the first place .
that was fair game .
this is bad faith .
bad faith ? i &apos;m going after samsung .
i &apos;m not murdering anybody
and lying about it to my partners .
don &apos;t you dare put me in with them .
you put yourself in with them .
speaking of which ,
what the hell you still doing in bed with these people ,
scottie ?
as you know , i don &apos;t always have the best judgment
of who i get in bed with .
and as for why i &apos;m still in business with them--
let me guess .
you beat me on the dissolution negotiation ,
you get your name on the door .
yep . darby agreed to it
the second that you pushed him out .
he only did that because he knew
when word got out that his house was on fire ,
he had to do something .
well , he did . he put me against you .
and as you just noted , our house is on fire ,
and i &apos;m gonna fight tooth and nail to put the damn thing out .
you can fight tooth and nail all you like ,
but it &apos;s never done a thing for you against me before .
that &apos;s because i always had something else on my mind before ,
but you &apos;ve made it clear that
that &apos;s never going to happen .
so , if you think you &apos;re gonna win this time ,
you &apos;ve got another thing coming .
say what you want , scottie .
i &apos;m going in there , and you &apos;re not gonna stop me .
i &apos;m afraid i already did .
client list just got locked .
so you can go in there and give it a shot ,
but they &apos;re never gonna sign with a guy
who just got played on their front porch .
i got your message .
thanks for meeting me .
it &apos;s not often i get invited out to hear an apology .
i &apos;m so sorry i snapped at you .
i got defensive , and when i went away to think about it ,
i came up with why .
why ?
i feel like a guest in your apartment .
and i think it &apos;s because we spend all of our time at your place
and none of the time at mine .
yeah , but i told you ,
when i &apos;m at your place ,
all i can picture is tess in a bedsheet .
i know . and that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
come on , i want to show you something .
louis , we gave you one job ,
and you blew it .
how the hell did you screw up those negotiations ?
screw up ? come on . what are you talking about ?
i got us the corporate jet .
we keep our first dividend checks ,
and they pay for our new letterhead .
so you know what ?
you just put that in your pipe , and you smoke it .
i don &apos;t give a shit about the goddamn letterhead !
you don &apos;t think i know that ?
nobody cares about the goddamn letterhead , okay ?
nigel went after mikado .
what the hell is mikado ?
not &quot; what , &quot; &quot; who . &quot;
she &apos;s a cat .
he went after your cat ?
he went after his cat .
he tortured his cat ?
he deprived her of my letters .
louis , you lost your shit during a negotiation
because someone didn &apos;t read your letters to their cat ?
harvey , please . i &apos;m sorry i lost my head .
i don &apos;t even remember signing the agreement .
well , you did !
and , louis , you &apos;ve been asking jessica
to give you the ball instead of me ever since the day i met you .
well , she gave it to you ,
and you just went and scored a touchdown for the other team .
oh , my god .
your grandmother &apos;s apartment .
i still own it .
you kept it this entire time ?
i couldn &apos;t rent it .
i couldn &apos;t sell it .
i ...
couldn &apos;t even come here .
that means the last time you were here ...
we were here .
so you want to move in here ?
i want us to move in here .
mike--
rachel .
i &apos;ve only ever been here twice ,
and both times were with you .
the first time we stood here ,
and we pictured living together .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
neither will i.
and the second time ...
was one of the hardest days of my life ,
but i got through it because we were together .
that &apos;s one the sweetest things i &apos;ve ever heard .
you don &apos;t have to answer right now , okay ?
i just wanted to show you what we could have .
goddamn louis .
let it go .
let it go ?
you don &apos;t say &quot; let it go &quot;
unless you already didn &apos;t let it go .
you gonna take it out on me for taking it out on him ?
at the moment , we don &apos;t have the time .
good , because i &apos;ve already got mike
looking for ways to revise the agreement .
the problem isn &apos;t revising it .
the problem is louis already signed it .
you &apos;re saying we need to find a loophole .
i am .
well , if we can &apos;t steal from their clients
and the revenues from new ones don &apos;t count ,
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
there &apos;s only one thing to do--
look at the money we &apos;re already owed .
i don &apos;t follow you .
we &apos;re on a cash basis .
we can &apos;t count the revenues we haven &apos;t collected yet .
but if we can entice someone to pay us sooner ,
we can get that revenue in under the window .
bad faith-- i like it .
the question is , who still owes us enough money
to make a difference ?
folsom foods .
the second they pay their settlement ,
we get paid our fee .
you came to that all on your own .
yeah , about an hour ago . don &apos;t tell me i beat you to it .
maybe . but you didn &apos;t have harvey slowing you down .
that &apos;s a fair point .
okay , i &apos;m right here .
well , your idea is no good ,
because it &apos;ll be a cold day in hell
before daniel hardman lifts a finger to help this firm ,
and i &apos;d rather lose this negotiation
than to cut a deal with that son of a bitch .
you don &apos;t have to . hardman was running point .
folsom &apos;s not his client .
they &apos;re robert zane &apos;s .
he &apos;s no fan of us either .
maybe not .
but we can handle robert zane .
you caught on to my plan there .
you mean the most obvious plan in the world ?
i mean the plan that i thought of and that you didn &apos;t
and that i &apos;m the perfect person to implement .
you really think you can handle robert zane ?
i have a relationship with him .
yeah . you &apos;re sleeping with his daughter .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s your biggest fan .
okay , it &apos;s not like that . i had dinner at the man &apos;s house .
i had dinner at the white house .
they &apos;re not gonna make me attorney general .
okay , first of all , bullshit .
second of all , do you have a better idea ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but are you ready to use your relationship with rachel
to get her father to turn ?
doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m not gonna do that .
i &apos;m just gonna use it to get him to hear me out
in the first place .
good luck with that .
hey , how &apos;d you know that white house thing was bullshit ?
mike . i was wondering when i was gonna get you out here .
ah , golf isn &apos;t really my thing .
what is your thing ?
sports .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re one of those guys
that doesn &apos;t think golf is a sport ?
of course not .
i can tell you &apos;re an athlete just by looking at you , sir .
with an attitude like that , you must be here on business .
folsom foods .
you &apos;re gonna stick that loss in my face ?
no , i &apos;m here to make that loss sting a little less .
you move up your payment by one fiscal quarter ,
we &apos;ll take a 10 % haircut on our fee .
10 % is a little light .
all right.i &apos;ll cut right to it . i can go as high as 20 % .
are you saying 20 % ?
yes .
then i &apos;m saying no .
sir , this ... this is a win for you .
no , this isn &apos;t shit for me .
this is about harvey specter and jessica pearson
and their divorce negotiations .
and you don &apos;t go to the one you didn &apos;t marry
to stick it to the one you did .
we could go straight to your client .
by the time they accepted the offer ,
it &apos;d be too late .
you just gave that away when you went straight to 20 % .
i went straight to 20 % out of respect .
now you &apos;re repaying me by being a--
what ?
you don &apos;t have the balls to say it .
i will .
a dick . i &apos;m being a dick .
the question is , what are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m not gonna do anything about it .
i just wonder what your daughter &apos;s gonna think
when she finds out you screwed over your own client
just to stick it to the man she loves .
she loves harvey specter ?
no . but when you go after harvey , you go after me .
the whooping crane of manchuria .
it &apos;s my calming animal .
you &apos;ve chosen well .
what can i do for you , katrina ?
i never heard back from you .
about what ?
about anything ...
especially what we &apos;re going to do about negotiations .
there &apos;s no more negotiation .
i had one assignment , and i blew it .
louis , the opera isn &apos;t over until the fat lady sings .
no , this is not the opera .
it &apos;s football .
harvey said it .
they gave me the ball .
i scored a touchdown for the other team ,
it &apos;s the eighth inning ,
and there &apos;s no more time left on the clock .
i never thought i &apos;d hear you say that .
it &apos;s the fact . there &apos;s nothing we can do .
i signed the agreement ,
and nigel &apos;s never gonna reopen it .
well , then i guess it &apos;s a good thing i found a loophole .
what are you talking about ?
we can &apos;t steal their clients ,
but we can still increase our revenue .
no . new clients don &apos;t count .
i &apos;m not talking about new clients .
i &apos;m talking about new revenue from clients we already have .
well , that &apos;s operating in complete bad faith .
now , what clients are you talking about ?
first , i got you something .
okay , katrina , you know what ?
i really don &apos;t have time for sentimental--
the trademark came through ten minutes ago .
i ... don &apos;t know what to say .
say you forgive me for letting you lose control of nigel .
i do .
now , let &apos;s go get some goddamn new revenue .
you .
how &apos;d you get in here ?
&apos;cause i know how to get things done .
you didn &apos;t the last time we met .
last time you saw me coming a mile away .
this time , i &apos;m blindsiding you .
i didn &apos;t know we were at war .
we &apos;re not .
it &apos;s just a training exercise .
these are my personal bank statements .
you stole my money .
no , not stole ...
relocated .
i could have you arrested .
you could .
but then you &apos;d be missing out on all this ...
tax shelter in the caymans ,
carried interest classification for your personal holdings ,
blind irrevocable trust for up to six of your unborn children .
and this means ...
you &apos;ll never pay a nickel in taxes your entire life ,
not to mention your money will be too secure
for someone to do what i just did .
how &apos;d you do all this ?
well , you said you &apos;d call us for the paperwork .
this is how i do paperwork .
oh , and one last thing ,
that ferrari that your ex @-@ wife took ?
yeah ?
i got it back .
you &apos;re hired .
don &apos;t you need to get board approval ?
to be my personal attorney ?
no , for gianopolous limited holdings
to expand their relationship with us .
are you crazy ?
how is that crazy ?
i just showed you what i &apos;m capable of .
you showed me you could beat a tribe of visigoths .
you want me to give you control of the roman empire ?
i can handle the roman empire .
even if you could ,
from mr. gianopolous &apos;s perspective ,
you &apos;re a nobody .
please , can you at least find a way to convince him ?
i &apos;m sorry .
if i bring your name up to him ,
he will laugh me out of the room .
that &apos;s a check from folsom foods .
it &apos;s the remainder of what they owe us .
holy shit . that &apos;s all of it .
it &apos;s hard to believe that you could get zane to do this
without using his daughter against him .
maybe i &apos;m an excellent negotiator .
if you &apos;re an excellent negotiator ,
this wouldn &apos;t include a 20 % haircut .
it would be 10 % , like i would have gotten .
you ? he wouldn &apos;t have even talked to you .
like you &apos;re not talking to me right now ?
what &apos;d you say to zane ?
let &apos;s just say we may have gotten what we wanted , but ...
my girlfriend &apos;s dad &apos;s gonna be pissed at me for a little while .
then you &apos;re a better negotiator than i thought .
i never should have given you my key .
and i never should have forgotten
that you &apos;ll stop at nothing to beat me .
no , you shouldn &apos;t have .
harvey ...
the man that i knew may have fought to the death ,
but he always operated in good faith .
i told you , i am not bound by good faith on this deal
after what your boss did .
it &apos;s not just edward &apos;s firm .
what does that have to do with it ?
what does that have to do with it ?
you shrunk the whole pie for the sole purpose
of getting a bigger piece for yourself ,
and it screwed me , along with edward .
what do you want , scottie ?
i want you to exclude the folsom foods payments
from the settlement calculations .
and why would i do that ?
because i need you to .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not enough .
you , uh-- you came to me .
you needed help with ava hessington
after you sent me back to london .
you said that i mean something to you ,
that i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll always mean something to you .
was that bullshit or not ?
it wasn &apos;t bullshit ,
and if you &apos;re in trouble personally--
i am in trouble personally . you said so yourself .
our house is on fire , and it &apos;s my job to put it out .
if you crush me ...
i &apos;ll have nothing .
that &apos;s not personal . that &apos;s business .
okay , let &apos;s talk business .
you made a career out of putting ious in the bank .
do the same thing right now .
put an iou in with me .
and what &apos;s to stop you from still trying to screw me after that ?
my word that i won &apos;t .
he asked you to move in together ?
i know . it &apos;s ...
quick ?
i was going to say that it &apos;s a ... a big step .
because it &apos;s not really that quick .
we &apos;ve known each other for a while .
yes , but you only just started dating .
so i guess that means you &apos;re against it .
rachel , i &apos;m not against it .
you told me that you love him ,
and i couldn &apos;t be happier for you .
but you got a lot going on right now .
you don &apos;t even know where you &apos;re gonna go to law school .
i &apos;m just saying
maybe you don &apos;t want to rush into this so quickly .
rush into what ?
well , mike asked me to move in with him .
move in with him ?
shit , what &apos;s he gonna do to me then ?
what are you talking about ?
you didn &apos;t hear ?
he came to me on the golf course .
to ask for permission ?
no , he didn &apos;t ask for shit .
i got to hand it to him . the boy &apos;s got some balls .
what ?
he kicked my ass .
didn &apos;t even have the courtesy to give me a--
robert !
oh , come on .
she &apos;s gonna be a lawyer . gonna hear a lot worse .
dad , what are you talking about--what happened ?
he wanted an advance on the folsom settlement .
and he put the screws to me to get it .
he put the screws to you how ?
rachel . this is a surprise .
what happened to--
tess in a bedsheet ?
it was replaced by the image of you manipulating my dad .
okay , i did not manipulate your dad .
how exactly would you describe it ?
i didn &apos;t go there to manipulate him , all right ?
he--he was about to make a decision
that was going to affect him , us , and his client ,
and i just pointed that out to him .
and then when that didn &apos;t work ,
you pointed out that i wouldn &apos;t approve .
he was bullying me .
so you used me to bully him back .
i was talking to my mom about moving in with you
when i found out about this .
okay , rachel ...
i &apos;m sorry , all right ?
let me call him right now . i &apos;ll apologize to him--
him ?
he loved it !
he did ?
yeah , he thought you had balls .
so then what &apos;s the problem ?
are you not listening to me ?
i was thinking about moving in with you ,
and then i find out that you go to my dad--
wait , wait , wait . are-- are you saying this changes everything ?
it &apos;s complicated .
what &apos;s complicated about it ?
forget--i don &apos;t even want to get into this with you right now !
rachel , if you don &apos;t want to live with me ,
why don &apos;t you just tell me you don &apos;t want to live with me ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
well , do you ?
you said i could have some time , so ...
i just need some time .
you excluded the folsom foods payment
from the revenue totals on this .
it &apos;s a draft document . i haven &apos;t showed it to anyone .
i just wanted to run it by you .
well , what reason could you possibly have
for wanting to do it at all ?
because scottie came to me and asked ,
and i think it &apos;s good business .
well , your idea of good business
is different from mine ,
because we already took less money from folsom foods ,
and now you want us to take less money from darby .
jessica , if we screw him over ,
he &apos;s gonna come back at us .
it might not be tomorrow .
it might not be six months from now ,
but he &apos;s gonna find a way .
you mean she &apos;ll find a way .
that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
and maybe she will .
but i &apos;ve never known you to run from a fight before .
my name was never on the door before .
you said it yourself .
i have to think differently now that i &apos;m in this position .
i did say that .
and it &apos;s not just gonna be one fight .
it &apos;s gonna be the hatfields and the mccoys all over again .
are you sure this isn &apos;t really about your history with her ?
what if it is ?
she could just be playing us .
she could , but ... i trust her .
jessica , it &apos;s time to turn the page .
well , i don &apos;t want to turn the page .
i want to close the book .
tell her we &apos;ll exclude the payment and honor our deal .
louis , i know it didn &apos;t go exactly as planned ,
but you need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off .
exactly as planned ?
i utterly failed .
i don &apos;t even deserve this stupid mug .
&quot; litt up &quot; ? it should say &quot; shit up . &quot;
you didn &apos;t fail . you impressed him .
yeah , that and $ 45 will get my cat a brazilian bikini wax .
you got a new cat ?
fostering .
louis ... enough .
you need to go to harvey .
you mean tell him that i &apos;m even more of an embarrassment
than he says i am ?
you &apos;re not an embarrassment .
you may need harvey to put the ball in the end zone ,
but you had the idea , you set it up ,
and you drove the ball down to the one @-@ yard line .
no , i didn &apos;t have the idea .
you had the idea !
and you executed it .
but you &apos;re giving me credit .
if harvey executes this , he &apos;ll give you credit .
no , he won &apos;t . he never does .
louis , he might .
you want him to see a different side of you ,
give him a chance to show a different side of him .
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter anyway .
harvey doesn &apos;t need my help anymore .
it &apos;s too late .
no , it isn &apos;t .
haven &apos;t you heard ?
heard what ?
harvey , i have some bad news .
what is it ?
i think you should sit down .
donna , unless someone died , i don &apos;t need to sit down .
just tell me .
hessington oil just fired us .
scottie betrayed me .
you don &apos;t know that .
one plus one equals two , donna .
and i know how to goddamn add .
i didn &apos;t count the folsom money ,
and suddenly our oil revenues are gone
and her piece of the pie just skyrocketed .
harvey , please , don &apos;t do anything rash .
what the hell are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying call her .
how would that go ?
&quot; hey , scottie , thanks for dicking me over .
could you please take it back ? &quot;
you don &apos;t know how it would go .
and you could find out if you would drop your pride
and just give her the benefit of the doubt .
you gave someone the benefit of the doubt ,
and look how that turned out .
you think just because you bought me a handbag ,
you can say that to me ?
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
but i just got played ,
and i &apos;m not about to call scottie and cry about it .
so what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna figure out
how to do to her what she just did to me .
harvey .
not now , louis .
yes , now , harvey . i &apos;ve got the answer .
the answer to what ?
to shoving the hessington oil firing up edward darby &apos;s ass .
harvey .
harvey !
tony gianopolous .
he can triple the revenue we lost with hessington oil .
and they &apos;re technically not a new client .
so there &apos;s nothing scottie can do .
well , what makes you think he &apos;s gonna go for it ?
because i went there , and they are primed to say yes .
they just won &apos;t ...
they just won &apos;t say yes to me .
give him this . they &apos;ll say yes to you .
louis , this is brilliant .
and if you hadn &apos;t had the balls to come to me ,
we &apos;d have nothing right now .
harvey , no .
i should have come to you sooner ,
but i didn &apos;t because i just--
louis .
i &apos;ve told you this before ,
but it &apos;s always been when i needed something from you .
and i don &apos;t need anything from you right now ,
because you just gave it to me .
so maybe you can hear it when i say it--
i respect you .
you &apos;re an excellent attorney ,
a valuable member of this firm .
and a friend ?
don &apos;t push it .
sorry .
seriously , harvey , i just have to say , um ...
it means so much when you say all that .
do you need a tissue or something ?
can i use your pocket square ?
under no circumstances .
i &apos;ll be fine . and you and jessica
need to take that over to gianopolous right now .
screw that . i &apos;m going over there with you .
he &apos;s not there .
what ? where is he ?
he went to see tony gianopolous .
by himself ?
no , with louis .
with louis ? what , is he mad at me ?
rachel &apos;s the only one who &apos;s mad at you .
she told you .
she didn &apos;t have to .
what were you thinking ,
pulling all that shit with her dad ?
i didn &apos;t think it would come to that .
he didn &apos;t mind . why should she ?
anyone who understands women in any way
would know that was a bad idea from the start .
harvey liked it .
proving my point .
i asked her to move in with me .
i know .
she told you ?
of course she did .
i can &apos;t intuit everything .
what am i , the dalai lama ?
donna , you should have seen her face when i asked her .
she was so happy .
i &apos;m sure she was . it was very romantic .
how could she be so happy and then just not want to do it ?
who says she doesn &apos;t want to do it ?
i told her to take her time ,
but i @-@ i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d need it .
why wouldn &apos;t she need it ?
just because you made some romantic gesture
doesn &apos;t mean that all reason goes out the window .
i &apos;ve had a pit in my stomach since last night .
i ...
i need to do something .
you need to look in the mirror .
what ?
i just jumped into a relationship with a man
who , it turns out ,
was pretending to be something he wasn &apos;t .
rachel already knows
that you &apos;re pretending to be something you &apos;re not .
all you need to do is just give her time
to figure it all out .
what if she says no ?
then she says no .
but pushing her isn &apos;t going to stop that from happening .
if you &apos;re here to complain about hessington oil ,
i had nothing to do with it .
i &apos;m just the majority shareholder .
i don &apos;t get involved in day @-@ to @-@ day stuff .
we &apos;re not here to complain .
we &apos;re here to bring a gift .
the question is , what do you get a man
who can burn a $ 50,000 bond ?
something money can &apos;t buy .
this isn &apos;t public .
it will be in 48 hours . and it &apos;s legal now .
how do you know that ?
because i structured it that way .
i can do more of the same for you , but he didn &apos;t tell you ,
because i wasn &apos;t enough of a name .
you &apos;re not .
but i am .
well , you are , as a man who shoots from the hip ,
which i like , but--
you also need a stabilizing influence .
not a football player .
but a fan of the ballet .
muscle .
and finesse .
and you guys think that i &apos;m not aware
that this is all about your merger negotiations .
oh , i was counting on you being aware of it .
because then you &apos;ll also be aware
that we can be very flexible in our billings .
as long as i pay enough up front
to tip the scales in your favor .
we &apos;ll structure a schedule that results
in you getting a substantial financial benefit .
which is his specialty .
go ahead . tell him .
he &apos;s a badass .
what do you say we celebrate our new association
over dinner in chicago with michael jordan ?
we can take my private jet .
hey ! which will allow us to pay for it
and for you to write it off .
i know you &apos;re probably busy ...
i &apos;m actually not .
rachel , i ...
i know that dating me is complicated--
mike--
i just--
i just want you to know you can take as much time as you need .
i love you .
i love you too .
i got into stanford .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i see you got my little gut punch .
i came to you hat in hand , and this is what you do--
stack the numbers ?
hat in hand ?
more like a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing .
what are you talking about ?
hessington oil .
i had nothing to do with that .
something dropped from the sky ,
tilted everything in your favor
right after i cut you a break ? i don &apos;t think so .
harvey , i gave you my word , and i honored it .
bullshit . you &apos;re just saying that
because i &apos;ve got the upper hand .
this is not about the upper hand .
you &apos;re always about the upper hand !
harvey , stop .
i came to you and asked for mercy .
do you know how hard that was for me ?
and then for me to turn around and use that to dupe you--
how could you think i would do that ?
well , what would you have thought ?
i don &apos;t know , but you could have called me .
and say what ?
and asked me to exclude the firing from the calculations .
i &apos;m not gonna do--
what ? you &apos;re not gonna do what ?
not gonna give me the benefit of the doubt
and be vulnerable-- expose yourself ?
i already did that when i trusted you .
that was mercy , which is from a position of strength .
being vulnerable is from a position of weakness .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
well , then i guess i &apos;m not going to either .
meaning what ?
meaning that i am not going to dissolve this merger .
you already signed the agreement .
then sue me .
you &apos;re gonna totally shaft me anyway .
what &apos;s my downside ?
in the meantime , you &apos;ll have a name partner
who can &apos;t practice in america , whose reputation is shit ,
and who &apos;s gonna tie up all your profits in litigation
for the next five years .
you &apos;re willing to do all that
and expect me to believe you weren &apos;t behind
us getting fired in the first place .
she &apos;s telling the truth , harvey .
what ?
scottie didn &apos;t get us fired .
ava hessington did .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
scottie could have arranged it .
well , she didn &apos;t ,
because ava didn &apos;t just fire us .
she &apos;s suing all of us ...
for malpractice .
