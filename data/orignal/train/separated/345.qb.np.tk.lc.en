miss , i &apos;m done here .
oh , i &apos;ve been done here for years .
you don &apos;t see me getting a parade .
oh , looks like we lost electricity .
uh @-@ oh , all the food in the refrigerator will go worse .
is it a bad sign that
i can actually see everything better ?
well , we finally found lighting that made the food look edible .
yeah , it &apos;s almost dark enough for caroline
to agree to have sex in here .
max , have you ever seen balls in light ?
they &apos;re not pretty .
nobody panic !
the power is out in the whole building .
we &apos;ve got less energy than a steely dan concert .
han , you look exactly like
a doozer from &quot; fraggle rock &quot; right now .
all right , we &apos;ve got to keep the diner safe
from hooligans and looters .
you &apos;re still on the clock !
and you &apos;re on my foot .
sorry , earl , i can &apos;t see you in the dark ....
but not in a racist way .
and i can &apos;t see you in the light
in a short way .
han , who would loot this diner ?
unless they &apos;re looters looking specifically for disappointment .
max ?
just taking this vodka
and cash register to a safe place .
our new dessert bar is under construction
and it &apos;s not quite there yet .
kind of like the credit card bill i lied about mailing ,
but i &apos;ve chosen you two
to be the first to get a preview .
she invited other people . they said , &quot; no . &quot;
she told me there would be some hard candy .
better be some hard candy .
i have peppermints inside .
then we &apos;re fine .
so it doesn &apos;t look like much now ,
but with a little moxie and a lot of work ,
it &apos;s gonna be gorgeous .
like khloe kardashian .
is that the one that &apos;s a dude now ?
okay , where &apos;s my treat ?
impressive ,
and you &apos;ve stolen almost nothing
from the diner to do this .
oh , wait , i see my sport coat is being used as a paint rag .
that coat &apos;s yours ?
i thought it belonged to a service chihuahua .
hey , everybody .
hubba , hubba , hot stuff .
you know , if i were still single ,
i &apos;d let you spackle my hole .
you heard what she said , beefcake .
i &apos;m not gay .
i &apos;m just very pro @-@ harassment .
i &apos;m proud of you , girls .
you &apos;re making your dreams come true ,
and my dreams , too ,
assuming you &apos;ll allow me to start a tab here .
i &apos;ll never pay .
does this mean you &apos;re not paying your tab at the diner ?
earl ?
he walks fast when he wants to .
i gotta get going too .
you know , we just came from the baby doctor ,
and he put me on bed rest .
at first i thought the doctor said , &quot; bed arrest , &apos;
which is one of my favorite games .
sophie , what &apos;s wrong ? are you okay ?
well , i &apos;m five months along ,
and the baby already weighs 15 pounds ,
so the doctor &apos;s just a little worried .
he &apos;s afraid it &apos;ll fall out
like a watermelon through a plastic grocery bag .
come on , baby , let &apos;s get you in bed
and get your legs up .
i can &apos;t believe none of this has to do with sex .
knock , knock . it &apos;s randy .
i got a six @-@ pack ...
and i brought some beers .
who wants some warm , wet , deli beer ?
this is why you &apos;re the best boyfriend ever .
warm , wet deli beer is the official drink of my personality .
so , randy , look .
what do you think of the new bar space ?
i &apos;ve got a bar @-@ related question .
how you gonna fit in the bar ?
it &apos;s all right here on the blueprints , see ?
the bar goes here , so that leaves ten feet
for the cafe tables and the front door entrance .
uh , you see this number ten right here ?
you see the two dashes after it ?
those are inches , not feet .
you got 10 inches .
first time i &apos;ve ever been disappointed with 10 inches .
well , that &apos;s the last time i get an architect
from the &quot; casual encounters &quot; section of craigslist .
the lady from the pizza place next door is banging back again .
yeah , they should pay less attention to our business
and more attention to their own .
there &apos;s so much oil on their pizza ,
the u.s. might invade it .
you know what ? i think we &apos;ve just blown past &quot; warm beers . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go get us some whiskey .
10 inches always looks a whole lot bigger with bourbon .
oh , my god , max , we need more space .
i know ; we spend way too much time together .
enough with the noise , cupcake bitches .
you gotta stop with this freakin &apos; racket already .
calm down , gina .
what , &apos; cause i &apos;m italian ,
my name &apos;s gotta be gina ?
it &apos;s angie .
gina &apos;s my middle name .
oh , i thought your middle name was &quot; bangs a lot . &quot;
angie , we &apos;re expanding our shop ,
and we have a permit for the construction ,
so it &apos;s above board .
which , yes , even i &apos;m surprised about .
you got a permit to destroy my business ?
nobody wants to eat pizza
next to this constant freaking racket .
what &apos;s your freaking point ?
max , i didn &apos;t know you spoke italian .
follow me .
i want yous to see the hell you &apos;re making .
um , that &apos;s a firm pass .
i &apos;ll throw in a free slice .
okay .
see ?
see what you &apos;re doing to our office
from all that banging next door ?
you &apos;re destroying it .
uh , look , you can &apos;t destroy a room
that has this strong of a &quot; hostage basement &quot; vibe .
you got cracks , and falling plaster ,
and my brother and i are fed up .
right , angelo ?
he says , &quot; right . &quot;
he &apos;s my twin .
we agree with our minds .
um , angie , when do we get that free slice ?
not to be pushy , but a deal is a deal ,
and today &apos;s a carb day for me .
what the frig ?
i just got my hair cut for our high school reunion .
now it &apos;s ruined .
it &apos;s a frickin &apos; war zone in here !
my father would be turning in his grave
if we &apos;d been able to give him a proper burial .
how you gonna make this right ?
look , angie and angelo ,
we &apos;re sorry about the inconvenience ,
but it &apos;ll just be another week of construction .
we promise to keep the noise down to a minimum .
right , max ?
she &apos;s agreeing with her mind .
hey , just came by to see if everything &apos;s okay ,
and to say i &apos;ve never seen the statue of david
with a slice of pizza over his junk .
who &apos;s this hunk of gabbagoul ?
this hunk is randy , and he &apos;s my--
lawyer , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s here to make sure there &apos;s no problem .
there &apos;s not problem , right , angie ?
the only problem i see now is that shirt on him .
hi , i &apos;m angie ,
but i &apos;m thinking about changing my name to yours .
props , that &apos;s a good line .
so , angie , what do you think ?
can you stand another week of the construction ?
all right .
i &apos;ll give yous two another week ,
&apos;cause of randy here ,
but that &apos;s the last thing i ever do for you two .
you , i &apos;d do whatever you want ..
tonight and in perpetuity .
&quot; perpetuity &quot; ?
better not be italian for &quot; the butt . &quot;
guys ,
i have a genius idea to fix the dessert bar problem .
what if somehow we could convince angie
to let us break through the wall and rent out their back office ?
come on !
this is a genius idea .
their business is struggling ,
and we could pay them rent .
it &apos;s either that or we have to use
dollhouse furniture for the dessert bar .
you know what ? she &apos;s right .
it is a good idea .
you just gotta figure out a way to get on angie &apos;s good side .
maybe you bring her a bouquet of cigarettes .
okay , caroline , the only thing angie likes about us is him ,
and honestly , the only thing i like about us is him .
that &apos;s perfect ; we should bring randy over there
when we go ask her .
randy , this has got to work ,
so wear a tight shirt ,
and maybe put a little parmesan behind your ears .
so , angelo , any idea when your sister is getting back ?
well , it is a long commute from hell .
hi , randy .
i would make out with you , but i just got a manicure ,
and i like to use my nails .
next time .
so we came here with a business proposition ,
and some delicious cupcakes .
i &apos;ll need the plate back .
get those away from me !
i &apos;m going to my reunion in a dress so tight
you could see the kidney angelo gave me
from when i had renal failure from drinking too much tab .
first of all , angie , max and i are so glad
to hear that you pulled through from the renal failure ,
but the real reason we &apos;re here is--
did you see randy ?
look , let &apos;s move this along .
we want to bust through this wall
and rent your little pizza hut here .
well , i &apos;m in charge ,
and i &apos;m not renting to yous two .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
i still don &apos;t have a date for my reunion tomorrow ,
and this stress is bad for my face .
i already have more filler
than a two @-@ hour &quot; dateline . &quot;
angie , how does a woman like you
not have a date for your reunion ?
i mean , not to be too forward ,
but hot magenta really brings out your eyes .
well , you &apos;re not wrong .
you know what would be wrong ?
if randy didn &apos;t take you
to your reunion tomorrow night .
do you want to be punched in the face with my ring hand ?
you know what ?
that ...
is a great idea .
angie , i would be honored to take your to your reunion .
oh , my god !
really ?
what about angelo ? what &apos;s he supposed to do ?
angelo ,
do you want to bring one of these two to the reunion ?
they &apos;re not my type .
two fives make a ten , right ?
oleg !
i know we don &apos;t really have standards here ,
but the customer said that her steak shouldn &apos;t do this .
well , tell her not to turn the plate upside down then .
i &apos;m facetiming with sophie .
she &apos;s lonely .
say &quot; hi &quot; to caroline .
i &apos;m not that lonely .
ugh , i just scrubbed a table .
that is how upset i am .
i should have never let randy go to that reunion .
and i should have never let buddy holly get on that plane ,
but what &apos;re you gonna do ?
other than play it over and over again
in your mind for 60 years .
max , it &apos;ll all be worth it
when we get that extra space for our dessert bar .
why would god make randy look like that
if not to help us get stuff ?
i &apos;m worried about randy .
he is strong , but she has the strength
of ten horny women .
somebody talk to me .
i &apos;m dying here .
i just watched all eight seasons of &quot; perfect strangers . &quot;
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m balki &apos;d out .
i just felt a shift in the force .
did somebody clean a table over there ?
is everything okay ?
she &apos;s upset because angie from the pizza parlor next door
needed a date to her high school reunion ,
and randy took her .
well , that &apos;s hurtful .
i &apos;ve asked angie out twice .
they &apos;re not on a real date , han .
he &apos;s just trying to convince her
to let us rent their back office .
randy &apos;s wasting his time .
it &apos;s actually angie &apos;s delightful brother angelo
who controls the lease .
angelo &apos;s in charge ?
angelo &apos;s &quot; delightful &quot; ?
ugh , i am so bored
that i just got a degree from devry university .
so she tricked randy
into going to that reunion with her ?
i am going to the high school to get my man back--
oh , my god , i sound just like my mother .
we should go there and sweet @-@ talk angelo
into giving us the space .
oh , but we &apos;re &quot; not his type , &quot;
which is a shame , because i really wanted some of
that 50 @-@ year @-@ old video @-@ game @-@ addict money .
well , where are we gonna get tacky dresses
and hair from 1986 ?
i can make you look like it &apos;s 1986
&apos;cause i lived in poland in 2003 !
how you doin &apos; ?
泡妞打招呼名句
how you doin &apos; ?
how you doin &apos; ?
oh , jimmy vecchio !
it &apos;s max ... blackilini .
doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
what about me ?
it &apos;s caroline ...
uh , cacciatore !
didn &apos;t we take math together with mr. bag @-@ a @-@ two @-@ shoes ?
never heard of him .
forget about it .
这是部fbi卧底意大利黑手党的电影
oh , there &apos;s angelo dancing by himself .
no surprise there .
wow , i &apos;ve never seen a sweat @-@ suit tux .
angelo .
it &apos;s max and caroline from next door .
um , you probably don &apos;t recognize us .
i &apos;m hoping no one does .
what ? i can &apos;t hear you
with the babe alarm going off .
oh , well , same to you .
what is that , terry cloth ?
actually , we came here to talk to you
because we wanted to ask you
about renting out your back office .
we know you &apos;re the big cheese .
you know , since you &apos;re here ,
maybe we , uh , cut a rug ?
she hasn &apos;t cut her rug in about four months , so ...
we could , uh , start off on the dance floor ,
and if we happen to end up
in the back of an &apos; 86 cutlass supreme ,
so be it .
so be it . forget about it .
excuse us .
max , i am not a whore .
that &apos;s not what your hair , dress , and makeup say .
look , you pimped randy out for that extra space ,
and now it &apos;s your turn .
you want that back room , make it happen .
on the count of three ,
say &quot; sex . &quot;
you handle angelo .
i &apos;ve been wanting to kill someone
for using a selfie stick , and she is the lucky one .
angie , god rest your soul ,
get your hands off my boyfriend .
max , what &apos;re you doing here ?
please tell me that &apos;s a wig .
she tricked you into coming here .
she is not in charge of the pizza place .
her brother is . this is my hair .
angie , is that true ?
did i do the electric slide for nothing ?
well , not for nothing .
we came in second in the dance competition .
okay , fine , it &apos;s true .
angelo &apos;s in charge .
my father thought he was the smarter one
because he wore glasses as a kid .
randy , are you okay ?
did the bad lady touch you in any of the good places ?
look , i &apos;m sorry i lied ,
but for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m having the night of my life .
believe it or not , i wasn &apos;t popular in high school .
i didn &apos;t date a football player
or get pregnant .
for once , i just wanted to show up a winner .
hey , ange !
oh , no .
here comes michelle pascucci .
please , don &apos;t ruin this for me .
who &apos;s this , ange ?
what &apos;s she doing holding on to your fiance
like he &apos;s the last cannoli at a wake ?
forgot to tell you , i got engaged .
wait .
unless that &apos;s not really your boyfriend .
&apos;cause , uh , you &apos;re known to lie .
well ...
she &apos;s not lying .
he &apos;s been cheating on me with her for years .
i , uh , caught &apos; em at the olive garden .
i smell a catfight ,
and drakkar noir .
catfight !
oh , come here , bitch .
just follow my lead .
okay , careful .
i spent $ 65 on my hair .
i was hoping not to touch it till next week .
don &apos;t touch my arm , bitch !
oh , i shouldn &apos;t touch your arm ?
maybe you shouldn &apos;t touch my guy .
finally , this party &apos;s getting good .
push me back .
did you just push me ?
yeah , i pushed you ,
but not as hard as your boyfriend
was pushing me in the back of the car .
oh , hell no , bitch !
i told you not to touch my hair !
oh , my god !
she &apos;s got a freakin &apos; knife !
all right , i &apos;m out ,
but only because ...
i &apos;m on parole
for pulling out a woman &apos;s bangs on the f train .
let &apos;s get out of here , ange .
is my hair dented ?
i &apos;ll fix it , hun . i got a chopstick in my purse .
get over here , you sloppy second .
i kind of like having a knight in shining--
what is this , aluminum foil ?
well , it is warming up the ravioli i put in my bra .
max , can i have this dance ?
so you think you and i would have dated in high school ?
well , when i was in high school ,
you were in your 30s ,
so ...
yeah , that sounds right .
i just convinced angelo to let us rent the back office .
i mean , i may have to be his date to the auto show .
wear something nice .
like a silk blouse
or a bikini .
he wants to show me off .
i never went to anything like this .
a reunion or a prom
or a class .
what do you do at these things ?
