i just heard you turned down a client
whose investment firm is worth $ 2 billion .
well , i don &apos;t give a shit how much they &apos;re worth .
i &apos;m not representing william sutter .
i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
i &apos;ve been saying it for 12 years ,
and i can prove it .
do you want to take a chance on each other or not ?
i just got a visit from sean cahill .
it turns out there &apos;s a way he can get you out .
what &apos;s the catch ?
he needs you to inform on your cellmate .
tell me the truth .
he said no .
but sean , i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;ll come around .
do you know how many strings i pulled
to put this thing in motion ?
you &apos;re gonna get me out of here like you promised .
i never promised--
six weeks , brother ,
and if i find out you &apos;re screwing me ,
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison .
how would you feel about renovating my summer house
in the hamptons ?
are you sure ?
i &apos;ve never been as sure of anything in my entire life .
the whole time , you were always gonna bring him here .
because this is the way to get it done .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me that in the first place ?
because it would &apos;ve ended up with you wanting to use rachel .
it ended there anyway . now get the hell out of my way .
harvey !
i told rachel everything .
i &apos;m taking the deal .
all right , let &apos;s talk specifically about what you need .
what i need is a conviction .
obviously , but what exactly does that look like from my side ?
it looks like a smoking gun ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been after sutter for three years now .
this guy &apos;s one slippery son of a bitch .
wait a second . william sutter ?
are you kidding me ?
harvey , what &apos;s going on ?
he came to me a week ago to take him on , and i said no .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you did .
no , it isn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
when kevin finds out i told his father @-@ in @-@ law
to drop dead , he &apos;s never gonna trust mike .
if you &apos;re saying what i think you &apos;re saying ,
you &apos;re not taking this man as your client .
yes , i am , because if i don &apos;t ,
we might as well not even be doing this .
then let &apos;s not do it .
look where we are , sean .
we &apos;re in a car , sneaking mike into prison .
you pulled every string you have to make this happen .
you &apos;re gonna pull out now ?
i am , &apos; cause i &apos;m not gonna put myself
in position to collude with you .
i won &apos;t put you in that position .
i &apos;m in that position right now .
no , you &apos;re not .
he isn &apos;t even representing anybody yet .
this conversation is completely hypothetical .
i don &apos;t need legal advice from the convict ,
and i don &apos;t need to lose my career
because you tanked this guy &apos;s defense .
i &apos;m not tanking anything .
i &apos;m gonna kick ass for him up and down the block ,
and there &apos;s no law against me rooting for mike
while i &apos;m doing that .
okay , but you cross one line that puts me in jeopardy ,
i &apos;m gonna pull the plug on this whole thing .
well , mike better get us what we need
before i have to do that .
hello ?
rachel . professor dunbar .
what is it ?
i know how passionate
you were about leonard bailey ,
but i just heard back from the innocence project ,
and ... i &apos;m afraid his case doesn &apos;t qualify .
what do you mean it doesn &apos;t qualify ?
we have three different grounds for an appeal .
and , unfortunately , none of them revolve
around the existence of previously undiscovered dna .
what does that have to do with it ?
the man was railroaded .
he deserves to have his case retried .
it has everything to do with it ,
because in a case like this ,
that &apos;s the primary determinant
for whether it qualifies or not .
i don &apos;t care whether it qualifies or not .
i promised leonard bailey that i &apos;d fight for him .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
professor , i know that we &apos;re not supposed
to become emotionally invested in our clients ,
but if we don &apos;t have any passion ,
then what &apos;s the point
of trying to help them in the first place ?
rachel , i understand this is a difficult thing to hear ,
but there &apos;s nothing i can do .
look , i give you my word .
we &apos;ll find you a new case .
mike , is that you ?
yeah , yeah .
go back to sleep . i &apos;ll talk to you in the morning .
how are you ? you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
what was it ?
whatever it was ,
they can &apos;t find a trace of it .
officially , it &apos;s food poisoning .
well , i finally got the chance to meet your buddy harvey .
harvey was here ?
mm @-@ hmm , in this very cell .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i shit you not .
you should &apos;ve seen him .
thought he was gonna attack gallo right then and there .
what stopped him ?
guards .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
i just need to get some sleep .
well , it &apos;s good to have you back , buddy .
once you get used to having someone around you can trust ,
it &apos;s hard to go back .
whatever it is you &apos;re doing , i want you to drop it
and help me buy a house in the hamptons .
excuse me ?
i said i need a large ,
expensive home in the hamptons , preferably on the water .
louis , i don &apos;t mean to be your business manager ,
but why are you buying a vacation home
when the firm &apos;s just getting back on its feet ?
because i told tara messer that i have a property out there ,
and i hired her to remodel it for me .
okay , let me get this straight .
you want to spend a fortune buying a home
so that you can spend another fortune remodeling it ?
it &apos;s the only logical way that i can spend time with her .
is it ?
yes .
what other way could there possibly be ?
you could just ask her out .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
why not ?
because i &apos;m not .
louis .
jesus christ , why are you trying
to sabotage my relationship ?
you have no relationship .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
i have no relationship .
i &apos;m all alone .
ever since sheila rejected me ,
i never thought i would find love again ,
but there is something-- i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s just something about this woman .
i feel like this may be my last shot .
i get that , louis , and if you ask her out ,
she is going to see a kind ,
intelligent man that any woman
would be lucky to be in a relationship with .
but if you do it this way , and she finds out ,
then you lose that shot ,
because she &apos;s never gonna trust you again .
look at me , donna .
a woman like that ...
please .
i need her to get to know me first .
all right , louis .
i &apos;ll help you find a house .
looking at my pictures again ?
sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i was just ...
i was just thinking about when i asked you
what you were in for . we got interrupted .
you never told me .
oh , well , just as well ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
okay , why not ?
why not ?
&apos;cause if i wanted to talk about it ,
i &apos;d be talking about it .
look , i understand that we &apos;re not
supposed to talk about that stuff ,
but when you think you might &apos;ve been poisoned by somebody ,
it makes you want to know something about the guy
you &apos;re sharing a cell with .
you saying you don &apos;t trust me , mike ?
kevin , i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;ve told you pretty much everything about me ,
and besides the fact that you don &apos;t want your kids to visit ,
i don &apos;t know anything about you .
look , mike , there &apos;s a lot of things
that i &apos;m ready to tell you .
i &apos;m just not ready to tell you that .
okay ?
mr. specter , you don &apos;t have an appointment .
it &apos;s okay , julie .
someone calls me a piece of shit to my face ,
i want to know what the encore is .
you here to piss on my floor ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that i &apos;m taking your case after all .
who says i didn &apos;t hire someone else
the second you turned me down ?
i do , because you didn &apos;t pick my name out of a phone book .
you came to me because you found out
that your guy &apos;s in prison with my guy .
so what if i did ?
cut the shit , william .
your son @-@ in @-@ law saved mike from a guy i put behind bars .
that means i owe you , and you didn &apos;t tell me about it
because you knew i &apos;d find out
and come crawling back on my own .
you &apos;re hardly crawling .
i didn &apos;t as a baby ,
and i &apos;m not gonna start now .
this is the best you &apos;re gonna get .
so are we doing this thing together or not ?
okay . you got me , harvey .
now what ?
now i go see your son @-@ in @-@ law .
why the hell would you want to do that ?
because he &apos;s in prison , and you &apos;re facing an indictment ,
which makes him the biggest vulnerability you have .
you have a call from danbury federal prison .
do you accept the charges ?
yes .
harvey , we have a problem .
what is it ?
i tried to talk to kevin .
i got nothing .
well , what do you want me to do about it ?
i don &apos;t know . it would help
if i had something to talk about other than ,
&quot; hey , what exactly are you in here for ? &quot;
okay , mike , you want something to talk about ?
i &apos;ll get you something to talk about .
well , if it isn &apos;t my knight in beautiful armor .
how are you , mr. bailey ?
please , call me leonard .
i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news , leonard .
the innocence project looked over the new evidence , and ...
they decided not to take your case .
what does that mean ?
it means there &apos;s nothing else i can do .
i knew you couldn &apos;t do shit for me .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t understand .
they almost never take cases without new dna evidence ,
and yours had none .
i don &apos;t care about that .
you asked me to take a chance on you ,
and now you march in here and tell me you &apos;re giving up ?
no , no , mr. bailey--
you said you would fight for me .
i did fight for you .
well , then fight goddamn harder !
i &apos;m sorry ,
and i understand how you feel ,
but there &apos;s just nothing more that i can do .
how do you know what i feel ?
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be kept away
from your loved ones .
actually , i do .
how &apos;s that ?
my fiancé &apos;s in prison .
how long ?
two years .
two years is nothing .
it doesn &apos;t feel like nothing to me .
what if it was forever , rachel ?
would you give up on him like you did me ?
i didn &apos;t give up on you .
you said you found compelling evidence .
i also said that it wasn &apos;t enough .
that sounds like giving up to me .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to give you official notice .
i &apos;m now william sutter &apos;s attorney .
congratulations . i hope you know what you &apos;re doing .
i do , because i &apos;m also here to notify you that
unless you bring an indictment in the next 48 hours ,
i &apos;m gonna sue you and the sec for harassing my client .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you heard me . you &apos;ve been digging
into his accounts , hounding his employees ,
and questioning his investors .
he &apos;s under investigation for insider trading .
that &apos;s how it works .
well , if that &apos;s how it works , then bring on an indictment .
ah , i see what you &apos;re doing .
mike can &apos;t get kevin to talk without me bringing an action .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , well , it doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause i &apos;m not
bringing an indictment without knowing
that i can win at trial .
and you &apos;re never gonna win at trial
if you don &apos;t shake the trees and see what falls .
damn it , harvey , i am not colluding on this ,
and you &apos;re in here trying to get me
to bring an indictment against your own client .
because when you bring that indictment ,
i &apos;m gonna beat it , and if you don &apos;t bring it
and continue investigating my client ,
i &apos;m gonna sue you , which is exactly
what i &apos;d be doing no matter who he was .
you know what , harvey ? you want me to bring an action ?
you got one .
jesus christ , there you are .
what &apos;s going on with the house hunt ?
i am on top of it , louis .
well , it doesn &apos;t look like you &apos;re on top of it .
it looks like you &apos;re drinking a goddamn cup of coffee .
maybe that &apos;s because i was on the internet all night
trying to find houses for you because i knew
that nothing would ever meet your insane specifications .
is that true ?
not one word .
goddamn it , donna , this is important .
right now there are hundreds of men out there
with beach houses ,
and tara could be meeting any one of them .
right now i wish i was meeting any one of them .
donna , i thought you understood this isn &apos;t a joke .
i know it isn &apos;t , louis ,
and that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t sent you anything i &apos;ve seen so far ,
because i haven &apos;t found the right thing yet .
and what if i said i lost confidence in your ability
to know what i &apos;m looking for in any given situation ?
then i would say that that is exactly
why i &apos;ve been avoiding you ,
and if you had any self @-@ awareness at all ,
you would stop bothering me and instead trust me for once .
well , we both know that &apos;s never gonna happen .
well , then , why don &apos;t you go find your own house , louis ?
gin .
again ?
how many times do i have to tell you ?
don &apos;t play cards with a guy with a photographic memory .
how many times i have to tell you i &apos;m still gonna beat you ?
deal .
sorry to interrupt your go fish .
there &apos;s a harvey specter here to see you .
saved by the bell .
not you , ross . miller .
mind if i ask why you &apos;re here to see me instead of mike ?
because i heard he &apos;s okay ,
and i &apos;m not just mike &apos;s attorney anymore .
i &apos;m yours .
i don &apos;t need your help with gallo .
i &apos;m not talking about gallo .
william sutter came to me to represent him .
i turned him down until i found out that his son @-@ in @-@ law
is the one who &apos;s been watching mike &apos;s back .
well , i appreciate that ,
but what does that have to do with me ?
i don &apos;t make it a habit of representing people i can &apos;t trust .
you saying you can &apos;t trust me ?
i &apos;m saying the sec thinks william &apos;s firm ,
the one that you worked for ,
is breaking the law .
so i need to know right now ,
when they come at you , what are you gonna say ?
i &apos;m gonna say the same thing i did
when they came at me the last time .
my father @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s innocent .
is that it or can i go ?
one more thing , kevin .
an indictment &apos;s coming down any second ,
and once it does ,
that makes you every single inmate &apos;s ticket out of here .
so if you ever have a doubt about william &apos;s innocence ,
keep it to your goddamn self .
kevin , talk to you for a second ?
yeah , sure . what &apos;s going on , george ?
it &apos;s about your roommate .
what about him ?
you got some nerve playing cards here
while my life is wasting away .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about that motion
you were supposed to file for me .
then you better get your facts straight ,
because i did file it .
yeah , and it got bounced right back .
what ? no , that &apos;s not possible .
it is possible .
while you were taking your little siesta in the infirmary ,
i got an email that said
the damn thing wasn &apos;t even filed right .
oh , goddamn it .
looks like you can &apos;t keep your promises .
no , i can keep it .
this is just some procedural mix @-@ up , all right ?
but i &apos;m gonna need to use your phone .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m telling you that i can have this thing taken care of .
i just need to make a phone call .
what &apos;s wrong with the goddamn phones in here ?
nothing , but i already used it today ,
which means i can &apos;t use it for another two days .
so unless you want to waste that time playing cards with me ,
which i guarantee you &apos;ll lose ,
you &apos;ll give me your phone right now .
i like you . you got balls .
you know what ? so do i ,
which is why i can take this out
in front of any guard in here
and know i &apos;m not getting in any trouble .
don &apos;t forget that , and get that shit handled .
harvey , i have something for you .
what is it ?
it &apos;s from sean cahill ,
and i need you to take a look at it right away .
why ? i know what an indictment looks like .
it &apos;s not an indictment , harvey .
he &apos;s suspending william sutter &apos;s trading license .
get cahill on the phone .
sir , i have harvey specter on the line .
you &apos;ve got to be shitting me .
harvey , what can i do for you ?
you can explain to me what the hell you &apos;re up to ,
suspending my client &apos;s trading license .
you wanted to get the ball rolling .
this gets the ball rolling .
this isn &apos;t what i wanted .
and i don &apos;t take orders from you .
and i &apos;m not gonna be able to stop this in court ,
which means sutter &apos;s gonna fire me .
then maybe you didn &apos;t understand my initial position .
i don &apos;t give a shit if you get fired or not .
you thought that you needed to represent sutter ,
so you went ahead and did what you needed to do .
i thought i didn &apos;t want to bring an indictment
before i had enough to win ,
so i did what i needed to do ,
but what i need to do right now
is finish this delicious ham sandwich ,
which means the next time that i talk to you ,
i expect it to be in court .
what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean , what &apos;s going on ?
i mean , we &apos;re playing cards ,
and harvey &apos;s here to see you ,
and then next thing i know ,
you &apos;re giving me some death stare ,
and you come out here .
nothing &apos;s going on .
well , what did harvey want ?
he &apos;s representing my father @-@ in @-@ law ,
which means now he &apos;s also representing me .
that good enough for you ?
all right , kevin , what &apos;s with the attitude ?
i &apos;m on your side .
are you ?
&apos;cause harvey said i shouldn &apos;t trust anyone in here ,
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that includes you .
what ? that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you know what doesn &apos;t make any sense ?
one minute gallo is your enemy ,
and the next minute ,
he &apos;s handing you his cell phone like he &apos;s your best friend .
i &apos;m trying to help him get out of here ,
which is good for both of us .
is that what you were doing last night outside of prison ?
you were helping him get out ?
is that what was going on ?
kevin , come on .
i was worried about you , cellmate .
i thought you were in real trouble ,
but they wouldn &apos;t let me see you ,
so i asked a friend of mine
who works in the infirmary to check on you ,
and ten minutes ago he told me that he &apos;s pretty damn sure
you were gone for at least three hours .
well , what do you have to say about that ?
i was gone because i was in the hospital .
that &apos;s the first i &apos;m hearing about it .
yeah , and why would i tell you that ?
why wouldn &apos;t you ?
something &apos;s going on here , and i can tell .
all right , kevin . you want to know what happened ?
i went to the hospital because harvey paid the doctor
because he didn &apos;t trust that
i would make it through the night in here ,
and i didn &apos;t tell you
because i didn &apos;t want to put you in a position
where you &apos;d have to lie for me .
you know what ?
that sounds like a whole lot of bullshit to me .
yeah , you know what , kevin ?
i think it &apos;s pretty goddamn funny that you don &apos;t trust me
when you &apos;re the one that won &apos;t even tell me
what you &apos;re in here for .
no . no . no .
shit , no .
no . no . no .
not now , harvey .
i &apos;m in the middle of something important .
whatever it is , it &apos;s not as important as this .
what is this ?
it &apos;s notice to suspend william sutter &apos;s trading license .
the question is , what can be done about it ?
nothing can be done about it .
what do you mean , nothing can be done about it ?
you &apos;re supposed to be the financial wizard .
i am , and i &apos;m telling you
that this kind of thing is at the sec &apos;s discretion .
they have unlimited power
to suspend trading licenses up to 90 days .
goddamn it .
it &apos;s only 90 days .
90 days gets me fired .
well , it &apos;s gonna be okay , harvey .
i mean , i know things have been rough around here ,
but business is picking up .
this isn &apos;t about business , louis .
it &apos;s about mike .
what are you not telling me , harvey ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you the details ,
because i &apos;m not gonna put you at risk ,
but i have a chance to get mike out early ,
and if i lose this motion , it &apos;s over .
well , then i &apos;ll figure out a way to get it done .
thank you , louis .
this is harvey specter .
harvey , it &apos;s me .
mike , what the hell are you doing with a private phone ?
what the hell are you doing representing kevin ?
you were the one having trouble getting him to open up .
and you thought telling him not to trust anyone in here
was the answer to that ?
look , i did that to get him to trust me ,
because if he trusts me , he trusts you .
yeah , well , you didn &apos;t count on one thing .
he knows i wasn &apos;t in the infirmary the whole night .
what ? how the hell does he know that ?
some guy he knows works there .
i told him some story about you taking me to the hospital ,
but he &apos;s not buying it .
then you figure out a way to make him buy it .
fine , i &apos;ll think of something ,
but that &apos;s not my only problem .
what now ?
gallo &apos;s filing came back .
it needs to be filed in person
and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record .
you got to be shitting me .
you want me to represent that animal ?
if you don &apos;t , then getting kevin to talk
is gonna be the least of my problems .
rachel , i need your help with something .
what can i do ?
i need you to draft a parole application for frank gallo .
i thought mike was doing that .
there was a problem ,
which is also why i need you to draw up an engagement letter
for me to be gallo &apos;s attorney .
done .
what is it ?
i heard you get upset with louis earlier ,
and now you &apos;re coming to me about gallo .
so ... i just need to know if you think
this whole cahill thing &apos;s really gonna work .
rachel--
harvey , just tell me the truth .
look , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s gonna work or not ,
but i do know i &apos;m not gonna stop trying .
got to say , you don &apos;t look so bad for a guy
who blacked out in the yard the other day .
yeah , they took good care of me .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re okay .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
i need you to get a message to the warden for me .
sure .
i &apos;ll bring it to him at our weekly brunch .
what would you like for it to say ?
i &apos;m serious .
i don &apos;t care what you are .
you want to get a message to the warden ,
you go through the proper channels
and get it to him yourself .
i can &apos;t go through the proper channels ,
because nobody can know about it .
all right , mike , tell me what &apos;s going on .
i made a deal to get out of here early .
what kind of deal ?
the kind where i inform on someone .
someone ?
kevin miller .
mike , come on .
julius , let me explain .
i don &apos;t need you to explain .
you are betraying your cellmate , who you came to me to protect .
no , what i am doing is putting away someone
who is out there doing worse things than i ever did .
so i don &apos;t need your judgment . i need your help .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s not my job to help you do something like this .
no , it &apos;s your job to help me prepare for life after prison .
well , this is gonna make life after prison
come a hell of a lot faster .
well , fine , you want to do this ?
you go ahead and do it , but i am not gonna be complicit .
you know what ? you talk a big goddamn game about trusting you ,
but what does that trust mean ?
now , i need to get to the warden ,
and i need to do it without the guards finding out .
can you help me or not ?
rachel , what are you doing here so late ?
professor , do you have a minute ?
of course . yeah , sit down .
i went to see leonard bailey this morning
to tell him we were turning our backs on him .
no one &apos;s turning their back on him , rachel .
there are just better cases .
no offense , but that &apos;s bullshit .
excuse me ?
you read his file .
there &apos;s enough evidence in there for him to get a new trial ,
and instead we &apos;re gonna let him rot on death row .
rachel , i understand how you feel ,
but there are some things that--
i feel like
i dropped your class to take this case .
and i told you i &apos;d get you another one .
i don &apos;t want another one . i want this one .
rachel , i cannot provide you
with the resources and the backing anymore .
okay , so what if i were able to provide my own resources
and--and to get the supervision of a qualified lawyer ?
what are you talking about ?
i work at pearson specter litt , professor .
they &apos;ve been known to take a pro bono case
from time to time .
okay .
okay , you win , rachel , but this is highly irregular .
i don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s not a good enough reason
to turn our backs on leonard bailey .
well , don &apos;t ever question my financial wizardry again .
let &apos;s have it .
i was banging my head against the wall ,
trying to figure out a way to stop the suspension ,
but then it dawned on me .
we don &apos;t need to stop it .
if we can turn sutter &apos;s firm into the subsidiary
of a separate holding company ,
we can find someone else to execute the trades for him .
beautiful .
yeah , but the only issue is ,
we need to find traders that are willing
to bankroll the son of a bitch ,
given his reputation .
well , that &apos;s not gonna be a problem .
no , harvey , this is not nothing .
nobody wants to work with this guy .
you &apos;re forgetting our new friends across the hall .
what ? what , are you kidding me ?
you think that asshole &apos;s gonna say yes to me ?
it &apos;s okay . i know who he &apos;ll say yes to .
harvey ,
i know how tough it &apos;s been not having mike here ,
and i just want to let you know that i miss him too .
i appreciate that , louis , but you didn &apos;t have to say it ,
because actions speak louder than words ,
and you doing this says it all .
harvey , i &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
well , here i am .
then maybe you can tell me why all of a sudden
we &apos;re representing william sutter .
i changed my mind .
you changed your mind ?
you told me taking sutter on would be like selling your soul ,
and now you &apos;re doing a complete 180 .
jessica , i--
no , harvey ,
i &apos;m not saying i don &apos;t like it .
i just want to know what &apos;s going on .
sutter &apos;s the one cahill &apos;s after .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i shit you not .
well , i get it .
you give him a full @-@ throttle defense ,
gain his trust ,
and hope to god mike cuts his legs out .
exactly .
what ?
is he gonna give us his investment business ?
not until after we win .
which we &apos;re hoping we don &apos;t .
jessica , i have to do this .
harvey , relax .
i &apos;m on board . it pays the bills ,
and we can leverage it into more business anyway ,
but we &apos;d better leverage it fast ,
because losing this case might be good for mike ,
but it &apos;s not gonna be good for us ,
and i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;d like to get back on top .
there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d like more ,
which is why i came in here .
what do you need ?
i need you to get something from those traders .
on your feet , ross . you &apos;re going to solitary .
what ? wait , what are you talking about ?
you heard me . 24 hours , let &apos;s go .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;ll go where i tell you to ,
or you &apos;ll get acquainted with this .
listen to me . i just want to know why--
next question makes it 48 hours .
you coming or not ?
what did you do ?
jessica--good , i caught you .
rachel , what is it ?
do you remember my innocence project case ?
how could i not ? badass rachel .
well , thank you . so i took it ,
but now they &apos;re saying that it doesn &apos;t qualify .
let me guess .
you want us to take it on as a pro bono .
all i need is one hour a week of supervision ,
and if i need to appear in court , you come with me .
i know that that &apos;s a lot to ask , but--
rachel , i wish i could tell you i had an extra hour to give ,
but i don &apos;t .
jessica , please .
if you would just come with me and meet this man--
no , this is my point .
i just found out we have less time than i thought we did
to get this firm back on its feet ,
and i can &apos;t afford to spend one minute on anything else .
but , i mean , really--
rachel , i &apos;m sorry .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
thank you .
thank your counselor , mr. rowe .
i will .
you must trust him a lot
to let him in on your little arrangement .
i do .
he helped me , even though he doesn &apos;t approve of this .
sounds like you don &apos;t either .
it &apos;s not up to me to approve or not .
is that what you came down here to tell me ?
no , i came down here to tell you i &apos;ve been doing this
a long time ,
and i &apos;ve seen a lot of inmates come and go .
these kind of deals , they don &apos;t always work out so well .
you saying you think i &apos;ll be here for the whole two years ?
i &apos;m saying i hope it doesn &apos;t turn out even worse than that .
i thought the markets were closed .
did you ever see &quot; wall street
money never sleeps &quot; ?
what &apos;s this ?
have a look .
let me get this straight . i hire you ,
and the first thing you do is come to me for a favor ?
i came to you for a favor when you were my tenant .
now , as your lawyer , i am coming to you with an opportunity .
what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s not a charitable donation .
you do this , you &apos;ll get paid for it .
how much ?
enough .
how do i know i &apos;m not leaving something on the table ?
because i never leave anything on the table .
all right .
you know , i don &apos;t get it .
you &apos;re obviously a big @-@ time attorney ,
and now you &apos;re subletting to me .
what the hell happened here ?
you don &apos;t know ?
why would i ?
google it .
that bad ?
we hired a lawyer .
turns out he was a fraud . it ruined our reputation .
turned out to be a fraud , or you knew he was a fraud ?
good night , stu . see you in the morning .
warden , what are you-- what are you doing ?
did you know mike ross
left the prison grounds the other night ?
what ?
don &apos;t bullshit me .
did you know his lawyer , who i understand is now also your lawyer ,
paid someone to get him out of here ?
i don &apos;t know anything about it .
i suppose if i asked you
who he paid , you &apos;d have the same answer .
i find out you &apos;re lying , next time ,
you are gonna be the one in solitary ,
and it won &apos;t be just one night .
what ?
i &apos;m just thinking about
when this asshole finds out
you &apos;re gonna blow his bullshit suspension out of the water .
william , i am gonna blow it out of the water ,
but i &apos;m gonna need you to sign this first .
what the hell is stevens investment group ?
it &apos;s the company you &apos;re trading through from now on .
bullshit . they own me ?
they don &apos;t own anything .
they control you on paper ,
and unless you want to shut down for the next 90 days ,
this is what you have to do .
well , bullshit .
what are you gonna do if that guy indicts me ,
cut a deal where i plead guilty , and i get probation ?
&apos;cause if this is what you consider winning ,
i might as well find myself another lawyer .
okay , gentlemen , i &apos;m ready to hear arguments ,
but i have to tell you ,
unless congress passed a new law last night ,
this suspension stands .
that &apos;s okay , your honor .
my client &apos;s firm is now
the subsidiary of a holding company
with a different trading license .
what ?
it &apos;s all right here .
in that case ,
i move to have that company &apos;s license suspended .
and that , right there , is why i &apos;d like to ask the court
to have mr. cahill removed
from any investigation
regarding my client in the future .
are you out of your mind ?
we have an antagonistic history , your honor .
everyone knows it , and this action
is nothing more than a stunt
designed to punish me through my client .
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;ve been investigating william sutter for 18 months .
and in the last 18 months ,
he took no action ,
and then yesterday , when i informed him
i am mr. sutter &apos;s attorney ,
within five hours he suspends his license ,
and now he &apos;s trying to do it again .
that &apos;s what i call a win .
mr. cahill , this doesn &apos;t look good .
i &apos;m inclined to take you off this case .
your honor , mr. specter is right .
we have history , but i &apos;ve been involved
in this case a lot longer than he has .
so if anyone has to be thrown out for a conflict ,
it is him , not me .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , your honor .
then let mr. sutter waive
any claims to conflict altogether ,
unless , of course , you want to set a precedent
that any time a defendant doesn &apos;t like his prosecutor ,
all he has to do is hire a lawyer
he &apos;s gone up against before .
mr. sutter , would you like to keep your attorney
or hire another one , because i am not
taking mr. cahill off this case .
harvey &apos;s my guy , your honor .
then unless there &apos;s some other issue ,
the court has a full docket .
guard tells you you have a visitor ,
doesn &apos;t say who it is , you start thinking
maybe angelina jolie opened your letters after all .
sit down , gallo .
you here to make more false accusations ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that , as of this minute ,
i &apos;m your new attorney .
come again ?
you need someone to file that motion .
i &apos;m that someone .
what if i don &apos;t want your help ?
well , then you can rot in here for the rest of your sentence .
it &apos;s actually kind of funny , isn &apos;t it ,
you fighting to get me out
when you fought so hard to put me away .
must kill you .
makes me sick to my stomach ,
but i &apos;m gonna live with it ,
because you &apos;re gonna give me something in return .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s that ?
until this thing goes through ,
not only are you gonna keep your hands off mike ,
you &apos;re gonna be his personal protector in here .
bullshit .
not bullshit .
he so much as twists an ankle in the yard ,
i &apos;ll withdraw that motion .
now , aren &apos;t you forgetting a little something , champ ?
i don &apos;t need you to handle this thing for me .
now that i know what &apos;s what , i &apos;ll get my own attorney .
yeah , you do that , and i &apos;ll tell the courts
that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison mike .
you know how much time that &apos;s gonna add to your sentence ?
i didn &apos;t do shit to him !
good for you .
who do you think they &apos;re gonna believe ,
a former prosecutor like me
or an informant convict like you ?
of course , if i &apos;m your attorney ,
i can &apos;t tell them any of that .
you son of a bitch .
you set me up .
i sure as hell did .
so it &apos;s up to you .
you in or you out ?
can i talk to you a second ?
what is it , louis ?
i can &apos;t find a house .
a house ? what house ?
i don &apos;t know anything about a house ,
certainly not for a person
who doesn &apos;t have any confidence in my ability
to know what he &apos;s looking for in a given situation .
donna , please , can &apos;t we just pretend that i didn &apos;t say
what i said , like we usually do ?
no , louis , we can &apos;t , because i need to know
that you have spent at least one second contemplating
what your little outburst was about .
i know what it was about .
really ? what is that ?
i miss you , donna .
i miss having you as my secretary .
i miss you too , louis .
and don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m not saying gretchen &apos;s not great .
who would ?
it &apos;s just--i &apos;m just saying she &apos;s not you .
who is ?
nobody .
was this the kind of thing you &apos;re looking for ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s perfect . is it still available ?
an offer went in this morning .
we have to beat it .
no , louis , we don &apos;t .
that offer was yours .
did they take it ?
we find out tomorrow .
donna--
no .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened with the warden .
yeah .
if you need anything--
i &apos;ll let you know .
look , i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t tell them
what you told me about harvey getting you out .
i need you to know that . it &apos;s important to me .
yeah , whatever you say , kevin .
i know i haven &apos;t told you why i &apos;m in here , mike ...
but you don &apos;t understand .
from the second i got here , i &apos;ve had to watch
what i say , every single word ,
and every morning i get up ,
and i remind myself
not to say the wrong thing to the wrong person ,
and every night i go to bed and think ,
&quot; another day down where i didn &apos;t . &quot;
yeah , you think i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s like ?
i &apos;ve been living a lie every day for years .
yeah , but you were just protecting yourself .
you don &apos;t have a family .
kevin , what did you do ?
i got in a fight with my wife .
it was ...
it was bad .
we said things to each other we never said before .
i went out .
i got drunk .
i got into my car ,
and i almost killed someone .
next thing i knew , i woke up in an ambulance ,
looking up at a police officer .
what ?
i made one stupid ,
stupid mistake .
and it &apos;s gonna cost me three years with my family ,
and it &apos;s not just the special things , man .
i &apos;m missing a thousand chances
to hug my kids in the morning ...
and kiss my wife good night ,
all because i couldn &apos;t control myself .
what were you fighting with your wife about ?
what do you mean , you were trying to protect your family ?
kevin .
i--yeah , i can &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t .
okay .
i &apos;ll do it .
excuse me ?
your pro bono .
bring me the file tomorrow morning .
jessica , i &apos;m sorry . can i just ask why ?
what does it matter ?
it matters to me .
i &apos;ve been out all day ,
trying to drum up business , and it hasn &apos;t been easy .
so from now on , when people google our name ,
i &apos;d rather they see ,
&quot; innocent man freed by pearson specter &quot;
than &quot; manhattan law firm hires a fraud . &quot;
thank you .
good night , rachel .
what are you doing here , sean
oh , you know what i &apos;m doing here .
what were you thinking , trying to get me thrown off my own case ?
he was coming at me . i had to do something to keep his trust .
well , for your information ,
if i get thrown off this case ,
that deal that you don &apos;t know about
getting that certain someone out early doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
no , i don &apos;t think you do ,
because if i hadn &apos;t pulled that shit out of my ass ,
this whole thing would &apos;ve been for nothing .
what are you so pleased with yourself about ?
nothing . it &apos;s just ...
you want me to take this case ,
and now you &apos;re getting pissed at me
because i &apos;m too good a job defending my client .
now that you put it that way ...
it was a good fix , sean .
it was a good move , harvey .
want to get a drink ?
why don &apos;t we just have one here ?
this might be the last one that we have together for a long time .
why ?
as of right now , you have no action pending against my client .
but as of tomorrow , i do ,
&apos;cause those indictments are coming down in the morning .
