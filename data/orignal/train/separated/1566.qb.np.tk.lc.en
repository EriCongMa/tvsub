what happened ?
nothing .
this is not fight club ! this is a school .
why didn &apos;t you ever get pregnant ? you always wanted kids .
and i have them .
could you maybe run lines with me ?
jesus didn &apos;t give me his pills . mariana sold them to me .
kelsey told principal sanchez about everything .
you &apos;re suspended .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can
run out of the house whenever you please
just to go see your boyfriend .
that &apos;s a restraining order , brandon .
if you go within 100 feet of callie again ,
you &apos;ll be arrested .
the independent living program .
get your own apartment .
i &apos;ll take that .
please leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s me . again .
i ... i ... i don &apos;t ...
did something happen ? are you all right ?
we need to talk or something , ok ? or text .
just let me know what &apos;s going on .
i hope you &apos;re ok .
ok , eggs are ready . who wants eggs ?
jesus , want some eggs ?
whites .
sure , i &apos;ll just unscramble these .
what &apos;d yolks ever do to you ?
ever since mom decided to rip into my wrestling coach
and get me benched ...
do not blame your mother for doing her job .
hazing is not ok .
this wasn &apos;t really hazing , it was more like bonding .
more like a beating . i &apos;ll take them .
you got a black eye , jesus .
that &apos;s not acceptable .
this is what guys do .
oh , please .
wait , are these cage @-@ free ?
really ?
i just wanna be in top shape .
i don &apos;t wanna give coach any excuses to keep me on the bench .
ok . let &apos;s just not go crazy , all right , jesus ?
with the adhd stuff and all ,
you gotta be careful about changing your diet .
i got it . thank you .
ok .
i miss school .
you &apos;re so weird .
ok , i don &apos;t miss school , i miss the play .
and i miss ...
the star of the play ?
oh , god . do you think chase knows i was suspended ?
do you think chase cares ?
ok . i guess i &apos;ll start my homework .
i feel like they should call it something different
when you &apos;re under house arrest .
so i have a doctor &apos;s appointment this afternoon .
so i can take you to work and you can find a ride home ?
oh , that &apos;s right , i completely forgot . yeah , that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll figure it out .
is there any chance mike is gonna fix the car anytime soon ?
this one @-@ car thing is becoming exhausting .
but think about all the quality time we &apos;re spending together .
jude , love , you do not have to clean up after everyone .
it &apos;s not your job .
i know .
there is something we would like to talk to you about , though .
yes , we would like to move forward with your adoption .
callie &apos;s too ?
we certainly hope so .
it &apos;s really up to her now . she has to decide if she ...
... if she wants to be part of the family .
ok .
so , what we need from you is to know
if callie decides she does not want to be adopted ,
do you want to be adopted without her ?
listen , rule number one of daphne &apos;s place :
no more u frickin &apos; a &apos;s .
maybe you girls can come by sometime this weekend
and help daphne clean up this place . get you started off right .
yeah .
now you ready to keep up your end of this deal , yeah ?
ok , we got weekly aa meetings , you gotta go to school ,
you gotta get a gpa that is passing ,
you gotta get a part @-@ time job ,
make sure that you contribute to the cost of living ,
and you got counseling , right ? right there .
that &apos;s a lot .
it &apos;s just one thing at a time , honey .
one thing at a time .
someone you need to talk to ?
no .
just curious if it works .
emma !
what &apos;s with the plastic undershirt , foster ?
are you bagging ?
i &apos;m trying to drop a class .
coach doesn &apos;t have anyone else on the team at that weight ,
he &apos;s gonna have to pull me from the bench .
that &apos;s takes serious dedication . i &apos;ve trained you well .
i thought you weren &apos;t talking to me .
because of your mom ? nah .
i &apos;m not big on icing people out ,
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t hang out with girls .
since you &apos;re dropping weight , i guess you won &apos;t be eating this ?
is that dijon mustard ?
so how &apos;re the kids ?
teenagers .
but pretty great , considering .
and we &apos;re fostering two more now , we &apos;re planning to adopt them .
hoping to .
wow , you and stef are so brave .
is that code for insane ?
well , yes , but the best kind of insane .
so , cycle regular ?
yes .
and , uh , any pain ? any tenderness in your breasts ?
only when i &apos;m pms @-@ ing .
ok . good .
so do you have any questions for me ?
am i too old to get pregnant ?
are you serious ?
no ... not really .
i mean , that would be insane . the bad kind .
well , if it &apos;s something you want ...
i did . uh ...
and then i met stef , and stef already had brandon .
and then ... the twins ,
and now jude and callie .
i guess i just wanna know ...
is it even possible ?
alright , i &apos;m on . i get it .
whoa ! sorry , sorry !
you can &apos;t just come in here anytime you want ! i need my privacy !
i had to bring my bag up .
no ! no , no , no ! no , no , no !
we need to establish some ground rules .
number one : when you see this on the door ,
it means ... it means i &apos;m taking a little jesus time .
what &apos;s so funny ?
i think i know what &quot; jesus time &quot; means .
that &apos;s not what i mean .
look , hat on the door , don &apos;t come in . got it ?
but that &apos;s not fair !
my room , my rules .
fine .
hey , babe . have fun at the gyno ?
it &apos;s more action than i &apos;ve gotten from you in a while .
hey , now !
who &apos;s that ?
dad ?
you get a new car , frank ?
brand @-@ new car .
toyota prius v. but it &apos;s not mine .
it &apos;s yours .
no , it &apos;s great , really . it &apos;s huge .
it &apos;s got these sliding rear seats that recline ,
and it &apos;s got enormous cargo space .
i think you could probably fit the whole family in here .
plus , it &apos;s a hybrid , right ? so that &apos;s great .
i mean , because it &apos;s , you know , really environmentally ,
you know , whatever liberals think it should be .
so , what do you think ?
uh ... i think we can &apos;t accept it .
come on , now . sharon told me that the volvo broke down .
and i know that lena &apos;s parents helped buy the house ,
so i thought i could help you buy a car .
i mean , look at it as a belated wedding present .
you mean the wedding you didn &apos;t attend ?
no , i mean the wedding i wasn &apos;t invited to .
well , that &apos;s a convenient way of looking at it , dad .
no , i was coming to the wedding , until you told me not to .
i told you not to come unless you could really support our marriage .
i have been nothing but respectful
towards you and lena and the family .
i &apos;ve accepted your lifestyle .
my lifestyle ?
you know , i &apos;m really trying here , stef .
i &apos;m trying to make it right by you .
so cut me a little slack , would you ?
please , just take the car back , dad .
family day is tomorrow .
you finally get to see your brother .
nervous ?
no .
who else is coming ?
my , um ...
... foster moms ?
i don &apos;t really know what to call them anymore .
um , their kids , i guess .
what about brandon ?
well , i don &apos;t know , seeing as somebody took my phone .
i doubt it .
so i had an interesting chat with dr. hillcroft today .
yeah ? she doing well ?
yeah . she says hello .
she was asking me ...
come in .
hey , honey . what &apos;s up ?
so i heard everyone is going to family day ?
i &apos;d like to go .
look , callie and i never should have kissed .
we just got caught up in the moment , at the wedding .
brandon , you said you &apos;re in love with her .
i don &apos;t know , i ...
i guess i got all messed up when she ran away .
yes , you did .
look , i get it .
but i just really wanna start putting all of this behind us
so we can be a family again .
and we should trust you ?
yes .
ok . we &apos;ll sleep on it .
good night .
you buying it ?
i have no idea .
when did our lives become so complicated ?
i &apos;m sorry , dr. hillcroft was saying something ?
yeah , i ...
i don &apos;t remember .
damn , callie . you roll deep .
i wish someone would bring my boyfriend to family day .
then again , i &apos;m not dating my brother , so ...
foster brother .
happy family day !
sweetheart !
hi !
ok !
missed you . hi !
hi !
hi , beautiful .
i missed you .
you look wonderful .
well , welcome , gang . come on in .
that &apos;s messed up they brought brandon .
yeah , it &apos;s like bringin &apos; smack to a becka party .
you ok ?
it &apos;s good . jude &apos;s here , so ...
he &apos;s cute . reminds me of my little cousin .
he &apos;s a dumbass .
you run out on him , he hugs you ,
and takes you back like it &apos;s no biggie ?
damn , becka , be nice for once .
who is the hottie in the sweatshirt ?
jesus .
you &apos;ve been kissing the wrong brother .
he has a girlfriend .
that has never stopped gabi .
brandon &apos;s way hotter .
he &apos;s got a girlfriend too .
carmen , brandon or jesus ?
i &apos;m not interested in boys .
called it .
i like men .
so , what &apos;s it like ? do you have any beefs ?
are you on the bug @-@ juice ?
who &apos;s got jigs for you if you have to dance on the blacktop ?
um , i actually have no idea
what any of that means , but , um , things here are ok .
busy .
thanks .
so , what do you guys do around here ?
um , well , we get up at 5 : 45,
and breakfast at 6 : 30 , chores .
we do all the cooking and cleaning and so on .
if we don &apos;t do it all right , we get extra .
thanks .
then we have school ,
and homework , group , more jobs .
then lights out at 9 : 15 .
sounds like a system we should try at home .
what do you guys say ?
families ?
would you please join us in the dining room ?
the girls have prepared a late lunch .
jesus ?
i &apos;m good . big breakfast .
this all looks delicious , you guys .
they make us go to cooking classes after school .
so chinese , italian , indian .
hence the orange chicken and cornbread .
will you teach me some of this when you come home ?
sure .
how is everything ?
how &apos;s school ?
fine .
have you seen connor lately ?
yeah . at school .
right .
jude , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok if you &apos;re angry .
i &apos;m not .
jude ...
it &apos;s just ...
you always push everybody away .
i just never thought that you &apos;d do it to me .
i wasn &apos;t .
no , jude , i was trying to protect you .
so you could get adopted .
well , i am .
i am getting adopted .
with or without you .
stef and lena already started the paperwork .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s all working out .
so you took out a restraining order against your son .
want to explain why he &apos;s sitting on my couch ?
he just wants things to get back to normal , so ...
hm . and you trust him ?
we &apos;re actually not sure .
we were hoping that today would help to answer that .
risky strategy .
brandon &apos;s our son .
if we ever wanna be able to bring callie home ,
we &apos;re gonna have to deal with it sooner or later , so ...
mm . i think you might need to have a conversation with callie .
she &apos;s applied for our independent living program .
she &apos;s trying to get her own apartment .
so , what are you guys gonna do when you get out of here ?
i &apos;m getting my daughter back . first thing .
i got a list . i &apos;m gonna be a nurse ,
or like a kindergarten teacher .
i &apos;m joining the army so i can shoot a sweeper .
i may be an actress .
i wanna be , like , a beautician
and an archaeologist and a housewife .
and a mom .
oh , me too . i &apos;m gonna be a mom .
i hate kids .
you guys done with these ?
yeah .
what happened ?
why are you breaking up with me ?
i &apos;m not .
well ...
what &apos;s up with the texts ?
&quot; i can &apos;t do this ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s over ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t write that .
well , someone did .
i don &apos;t even have my phone , somebody took it ...
i thought he threw it out ... i &apos;m gonna kill him .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m just happy you didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t .
演唱者 genevieve
we &apos;re just talking .
that &apos;s ok , talking is allowed .
uh , callie , rita was telling us about independent living .
i was going to tell you .
so is that ... that &apos;s really what you want to do ?
um , i want to thank you for everything that you &apos;ve done for me .
and for adopting jude .
i really feel like it &apos;s time for me to be on my own .
brandon , did you know about this ?
no .
how is a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl allowed to live on her own ?
i don &apos;t know .
how is she even allowed to make that choice so soon ?
shouldn &apos;t there be some sort of cooling off period
before we let a teenage runaway make a major life decision ?
it makes me sad too . she has an entire lifetime to be alone .
why make things so hard on herself now ?
do you think she &apos;s doing this so she can be with brandon ?
i hope not .
i &apos;m busy !
i need my homework .
come back later !
what &apos;s in the bag ?
ok , i know you didn &apos;t throw my phone away .
and i know you &apos;ve been texting brandon .
i was doing you a favor .
i don &apos;t need favors .
you can &apos;t have a boyfriend while you &apos;re in here .
you can &apos;t do drugs either .
so that &apos;s in your bag , right ?
here &apos;s the deal .
you give me the phone back , i won &apos;t get rita .
it &apos;s not what you think .
wait .
respect the hat !
i need my homework !
dude , the hat was on the door !
who are you talking to ?
that &apos;s not lexi .
shut up !
hi . i &apos;m emma .
so you &apos;re telling me you just locked me out
without my book for over an hour
so you could have &quot; jesus time &quot; with another girl ?
wait , what &apos;s &quot; jesus time ? &quot;
you on the computer with lexi ?
emma , stop it .
i hope you don &apos;t think you and i were gonna have &quot; jesus time . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not like that !
hey ! it &apos;s my room too !
well , too bad .
you can &apos;t just write rules as you go !
you can &apos;t just lock me out !
jude !
hey ! what &apos;s going on here ?
he keeps putting his stupid hat on the door
so he can have &quot; jesus time . &quot;
is that true ?
i &apos;m gonna go . talk to you later , jesus .
jesus , be the big brother , please ?
we will be back to discuss this . jude , we need to talk .
come on .
you can &apos;t throw things at people ,
that &apos;s not how we solve our problems here .
jesus kicked me out of my room .
and he shouldn &apos;t have done that .
he &apos;s gonna hear about it . but that &apos;s not an excuse .
i &apos;m sorry .
never again , bud .
he called it his room . his room .
he threw something at jesus , like a real little brother !
yay !
i &apos;m not a drug addict .
ok .
i &apos;m serious . those weren &apos;t &quot; drug &quot; drugs .
they &apos;re hormones .
i can &apos;t wait any longer to be put in an lgbt home
or to turn 18 so i can get a doctor to prescribe them .
what about your parents ?
they like sign off , or ... give consent ?
did you see any parents there for me on family day ?
that &apos;s five in a row . they don &apos;t approve .
they think me being a boy is just code for me being a lesbian ,
which they &apos;re not cool with either .
told me to act like a girl , or get out .
lived on my own for ten months .
did what i had to do to survive , and pay for the hormones .
got busted . got sent to juvie . got sent here .
i &apos;ve been off them for a few months ,
and my body is freaking out , reverting back to ...
look ...
i need to use your phone to call my hook @-@ up ,
so i can get back on the hormones .
the brandon thing was just ...
me being a jerk .
i &apos;m sorry .
you may have noticed , i &apos;ve got some anger issues .
are they safe ? the hormones ?
yeah .
they &apos;re exactly what i would get
if i was allowed to see a doctor .
well , just tell me when you
need to use the phone and i &apos;ll give it to you .
but no more impersonating me .
deal .
演唱者 sea stars
oh , hell no !
we just need a few minutes .
how &apos;d you know she was here ?
you think you &apos;re going to stay in here all alone
with your biggest temptation ?
we &apos;re gonna hit up the 7 @-@ eleven .
we need some more of those wipey things .
we do ?
fifteen minutes .
they &apos;re hardcore .
yeah . that &apos;s their job .
i thought you must be missing this .
thanks .
so this is , uh , independent living ?
pretty sweet deal .
well , it &apos;s not like they just give you an apartment .
i have to do a lot of stuff . like counseling
and special classes .
but , yeah ... no , it &apos;s ...
let me give you the tour .
that &apos;s the bedroom , bathroom ,
kitchen , living room .
it &apos;s spacious .
this place is too white , though .
i wanna paint mine .
nice .
yeah , i &apos;ve got , like , a couch ,
or a love seat , maybe a coffee table .
and some posters or something .
really make the place mine .
yeah .
we could , um , put your keyboard over there .
my keyboard ?
yeah .
yeah , we &apos;ll , um ,
we &apos;ll put a 50 @-@ inch lcd right over there .
killer sound system .
that costs too much .
we need to get a nice kitchen table first .
you want a nice kitchen table over a tv ?
where else are we gonna eat our breakfast ?
i do make some serious pancakes .
and i can serenade you , anytime you please .

what happened ?
cole ?
back away , ok ? give everybody some room .
is he gonna be ok , sir ?
we &apos;re gonna find out soon .
what happened ?
becka found cole unconscious in the bathroom .
he od &apos;d .
there were needles on the floor ,
and this next to it . anyone know anything about that ?
ma &apos;am ?
ok , ladies , listen up .
the doctors are gonna be monitoring cole
for the next couple of hours .
he took a very large dose of street hormones ,
and that caused a seizure .
and when he fell , he hit his head .
he told me they &apos;re just like the kind a doctor would give him .
well , they may be .
but they cause a tremendous amount of side effects ,
which is why you have to get them from a doctor .
you &apos;re his roommate .
i didn &apos;t give him the drugs .
and i &apos;m not a narc .
yeah , but you &apos;re supposed to be accountable for him .
it &apos;s different .
i &apos;m sorry , ok ?
i &apos;m doing the best i can .
no , you &apos;re not .
you never say nothing in group .
when you do , you just say what you think we want to hear .
you always asking us to cover for you .
but we all know , all you care about is getting out of here .
so if you don &apos;t want to be here , then go .
if you don &apos;t take this seriously ,
you &apos;re screwing it up for the rest of us , and we need this .
how am i screwing it up ? none of you want to be here .
we &apos;re just here because the court made us .
yeah , but we ended up here
because we didn &apos;t have nobody to look out for us .
and you &apos;ve got people .
you &apos;ve got your brother .
you got a family that wants you .
so , what &apos;re you doing here ?
here &apos;s a four @-@ door sedan , $ 5,200 .
air . cd player . power windows .
anchor points for a baby seat .
thank god those days are behind us .
yeah , but it &apos;s 12 years old and no warranty .
if it breaks down ,
we &apos;re right back in the same exact position we are now .
minus $ 5,200 .
here &apos;s a minivan .
uh , 2009 , a little above our price range .
not to mention it violates our sacred oath never to drive a minivan .
or we could always accept frank &apos;s gift .
no .
i &apos;m not saying we should .
i &apos;m just saying we could ...
no .
... revisit ?
lena , it &apos;s like he &apos;s saying ,
&quot; i can &apos;t support your marriage because i &apos;m a bad father ,
but here &apos;s a new car to make up for my ignorance and intolerance . &quot;
by taking the car , we &apos;re saying it &apos;s ok . and it &apos;s not ok .
it &apos;s not , but intolerance works both ways .
i &apos;m sorry , exactly how am i intolerant ?
you &apos;re not , to me .
but we &apos;re operating under the assumption
that we &apos;re right and he &apos;s wrong .
he is wrong .
yes , of course he &apos;s wrong .
but in his perspective , he &apos;s right and we &apos;re wrong .
so maybe he &apos;s just trying to meet us halfway
because he loves you and he loves our family
and he wants to keep that relationship with us .
no . my dad sees a problem , he writes a check , boom , problem solved .
maybe this isn &apos;t a payoff . maybe this is just a nice gesture ?
you know what would have been a better gesture ?
coming to the wedding .
in all fairness , you asked
him not to come unless he changed his beliefs .
yes , his bigoted beliefs !
stef , it &apos;d be like if he invited us to dinner ,
but only if we registered republican first .
wow , you must really want this car .
oh , god ! that is not fair . this has nothing to do with the car .
i &apos;m just thinking that this is a real opportunity
for you to talk things out with him .
i &apos;ve been down this road with him so many times , lena .
and you know that .
stef .
stef .
dr. hillcroft , hi .
hi , lena ?
so i got your test results . your levels are all good .
so that means i still have time ?
actually , at your age ,
levels can drop drastically in a pretty short period .
what does that mean ?
well , if you want to get pregnant , it could be now or never .
so would you like me to start you on pre @-@ natal vitamins ?
i can call in a prescription .
yes .
the girls are right about you , you know . you don &apos;t commit .
and we nearly lost cole .
that &apos;s not fair .
of course it isn &apos;t . but that &apos;s how it works .
i know exactly what you &apos;re doing , callie .
another person to tell me who i am .
i &apos;ve been married a couple of times .
my first husband , sweetest guy , jeff .
let me guess , something terrible happened to him
and you &apos;ve never forgiven yourself .
i cheated on him .
i was so insecure .
i didn &apos;t think i was smart enough or funny enough
or thin enough for him to ever really love me .
i never felt safe .
i couldn &apos;t ever trust , so i couldn &apos;t ever commit ,
i was so sure that everything was gonna be taken from me ,
that i took it away from myself .
i don &apos;t really know why , callie , but you do the same exact thing .
always with one foot out the door ,
never taking the time to really connect .
i think it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re scared .
i &apos;m not scared , i &apos;m sick of it .
i just want to be on my own .
you do ?
mm @-@ hm . yeah .
really ? yeah .
because you think it &apos;s safer that way ?
ok , rita , i get it . you want me to go back to the fosters .
i &apos;m not you , ok ? that &apos;s not what i want .
that doesn &apos;t mean there &apos;s something wrong with me .
honey , i &apos;m not here to make choices for you .
but you need to realize
if you keep making decisions the way you &apos;ve been making decisions ,
you &apos;re gonna ruin every good thing that comes your way .
no matter what it is , no matter how great it is ,
you &apos;re gonna blow it up because you don &apos;t trust it .
whether that &apos;s the ilp , the fosters ,
your time here , everything .
i &apos;ve gotta go study .
of course you do .
now , slowly . because i got you .
i &apos;m fine .
ok . callie , a little help with the bed ?
thank you . ok , right here .
now , gently . right , there you go . all right .
ok .
how are you feeling ?
like i had a seizure and slammed my head into the sink .
you know what , cole ?
you scared the crap out of me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re here now .
ok ?
you know um ... i &apos;m really thirsty . do you think ... ?
yes . i will go get you something . ok . i &apos;ll be right back .
thanks .
are you ok ?
i heard rita calling my folks at the hospital .
telling them know where i was , what happened .
i just really thought they would come .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m tired .
i know where i need to be now .
i need to be here .
hey , dad ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not here to yell at you .
dad ?
hey , dad .
dad .
dad .
