i may not agree with the way ezra lives his life ,
but i &apos;m not gonna stand by and let you ruin him .
alison made my dad this collage ,
and there was a picture of her on a boat .
that &apos;s the one .
cece told you she didn &apos;t know ?
why did she lie ?
i haven &apos;t told you guys the truth .
what truth ?
toby and i broke up .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m about to meet my son .
mona sent you , didn &apos;t she ?
spencer , she recognizes self @-@ destructive aggressive behavior .
and who &apos;s looking cray cray now , spencer ?
die !
stay at my place .
no , i--
yes . you &apos;ll sleep on our couch .
we can make that jump .
no !
jason !
the patient in bed 3 , jason dilaurentis .
where &apos;d he go ?
how you holding up , em ?
don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be taking an elevator any time soon .
any word from jason ?
no . nothing .
okay , so now that the whole n.a.t. club is out of rosewood ,
do you think that &quot; a &quot; will retire ?
or just have more time for us .
way to think positive , spence .
i just doubt suddenly everything &apos;s gonna be lilacs and daffodils .
guys , let &apos;s focus .
cece lied about knowing wilden ,
and then we find a picture of both of them with ali .
yeah , a picture that &apos;s gone now .
new rule . next time we see
anything that might be important to us down the road ,
it goes in the phone .
okay , so is it possible that cece is ...
what are we calling her , red coat ?
i never saw a face .
yeah , me neither .
what do you think , spencer ?
blonde ? red coat ? captain of the &quot; a &quot; team ?
maybe it &apos;s cece .
pay attention . we need this brain trust firing on all cylinders .
我们能谈谈今晚的事吗
what happened tonight with you and wren ?
it &apos;s nothing . i ...
mona and i had a ... moment ,
and , uh , he saw , that &apos;s all .
a moment that might make her try and cut emily in half ?
no . no , you guys , this wasn &apos;t mona .
we were in a different county .
well , then who do you think it was ?
we &apos;re closed .
you &apos;re here .
i have the keys .
yeah , and drinking coffee &apos;s not a crime .
what are you doing here ?
looking for you girls .
wait , you were following us ?
jason dilaurentis has been saying some nasty things about me .
like what ?
don &apos;t play dumb , hanna .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time you made up a story .
well , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so why don &apos;t you just leave us alone .
it &apos;s just a question . no need to get so defensive .
why don &apos;t you ask cece drake ?
hanna .
we know about the little boat ride you two took with alison .
it &apos;s late .
we were just leaving .
care for a ride ?
it &apos;s not safe this time of night .
we &apos;re good .
oh , and hanna ...
see you around .
is caleb having fun with his dad ?
yeah . yeah , i think so .
after all the hurdles you went through to get them together ,
i thought you &apos;d be more enthusiastic .
they &apos;re just stripping fixtures at his aunt &apos;s house ...
copper pipes are not that exciting .
am i missing something ?
no .
look , mom , you &apos;re gonna be late for work .
just get in the car .
what is going on ? what ?
hanna , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
that wasn &apos;t nothing .
i @-@ i just know the girl who got in his car .
that doesn &apos;t explain the look he just gave you .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , mom , all right ?
wilden &apos;s a freak . he hates us .
hanna , did he talk to you again without me being there ?
because veronica hasting said he wasn &apos;t allowed--
no , it &apos;s fine .
okay . i &apos;ll talk to him myself then .
no !
you &apos;re not giving me a choice .
well , you can &apos;t .
we &apos;re just trying to figure out why he &apos;s always after us .
okay .
so we were thinking that maybe wilden and ali
had a relationship .
what kind of relationship ?
oh , my god , hanna .
why did you even go there ?
mom , i told you it was a dumb theory .
no wonder he &apos;s upset .
you can &apos;t go around saying those things about people ,
no matter how much you don &apos;t like them .
well , don &apos;t worry about it .
it all started when that girl got in his car ,
and i already told wilden .
so it &apos;s over .
how do you even know this person ?
she was friends with ali .
she &apos;s a one @-@ woman rumor factory .
all right , well , i don &apos;t want you associating with her anymore , okay ?
okay . never again . gladly .
i have to go meet emily .
oh , my god . you &apos;re still in bed ?
mom and dad called .
i didn &apos;t tell them you &apos;ve been skipping school .
any idea how much longer i &apos;ll be covering for you ?
if they call again , i &apos;m telling them the truth .
you told your mom ?
don &apos;t worry about it . we &apos;re fine . i covered for us .
what were you thinking ? you can &apos;t tell her something like that .
i was distracted by cece and wilden , okay ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense . i thought she was protecting him .
well , what if we were wrong ,
and i just set ali &apos;s baby daddy / killer on her tail ?
why would she lie about knowing him ?
we have to find out the truth ... confront her .
where ? in wilden &apos;s trunk ?
he wouldn &apos;t grab her in broad daylight
if he was gonna hurt her .
probably .
have you heard from jason ?
he texted . he &apos;s laying low
at a friend &apos;s place in virginia for a while .
i kinda wish he took me with him .
did you tell paige that she almost
got two emilys for the price of one ?
are you kidding ?
she &apos;s worried enough about me as it is .
do you think paige and caleb have told us everything ?
i mean , with them digging into mona ,
do you think they found out something that we could use ?
&quot; a &quot; almost killed me . i am not exposing paige to that .
no , of course not .
but would it hurt to find out
if she picked up anything useful ?
yeah , i @-@ i guess we could go and talk to her after school .
how is caleb , anyway ?
everything go okay with the reunion ?
yeah . yeah , mostly .
what part isn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know . this weird thing happened .
i put a five dollar bill in the church collection box ,
and it had some dice drawn on it .
and later that day , caleb &apos;s dad had it .
you gave money to a church ?
emily , i &apos;m serious .
do you know how much money has writing on it ?
george washington has dreadlocks on like half my tips .
yeah , i know , but what if it was the same one .
the guy &apos;s an ex @-@ con .
hanna , do you really think he would steal
from the place that just hired him ?
we need to find out the truth .
hey , wes .
look , i think that we should talk--
ezra .
when did you get back ?
3 : 00 this morning .
i crashed as soon as i got in .
i just woke up .
i haven &apos;t been sleeping much the past few weeks .
yeah , me neither .
i guess i &apos;m just a little confused on why
you never called me on one of those sleepless nights .
aria , my life turned upside down .
i needed some time to think about things .
things like us ?
for one .
i mean , not about my feelings for you , obviously .
obviously .
what is that supposed to mean ?
ezra , you &apos;ve been radio silent ever since you left .
it &apos;s given me nothing to do but fear the worst .
that you &apos;d moved on .
no .
aria , no . if ...
if anything , i was trying to be fair to you
and not drag you into the middle of this .
i already am .
and i feel terrible about that .
because this isn &apos;t-- this isn &apos;t what you signed up for .
that &apos;s not your decision to make , it &apos;s mine .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i shut you out , and that was wrong .
how was your trip ?
&quot; surreal &quot; definitely comes to mind .
but , uh ...
malcolm &apos;s amazing .
he &apos;s smart , lively , really artistic .
did maggie ever tell you why she kept it a secret ?
she did .
my mother paid her to keep quiet .
that &apos;s disgusting .
sorry .
no , no , you &apos;re right , and believe me ,
i gave her an earful over the phone .
can i bring you up to speed over dinner ?
i never would have said this prior to meeting you ,
but i &apos;ve actually been craving vegan takeout .
i want you in my life , aria .
every part of it .
if you &apos;re willing .
i just missed you .
i missed you , too .
what happened with wes ?
when you came in , you were on the phone .
said you needed to talk .
oh , right , yeah . no , nothing . we , um ...
he helped me with a shoot the other night ,
and we messed up some stuff at cece &apos;s store .
it was nothing .
ok .
i &apos;m gonna be late for school .
okay .
spencer ?
hey . sorry .
i just wanted to spend my free period in the quiet .
i haven &apos;t seen you in a few days .
yeah . bad week .
i understand if you don &apos;t want me in your classroom .
no , it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t mind .
do you feel like talking ?
well , i guess you &apos;ve heard ...
about mona .
mrs. horowitz wanted you suspended ,
but mona said it was just a misunderstanding .
spencer , i &apos;ve known you most of your life .
and you &apos;ve always been the kind of person
who would bounce back from disappointment .
i &apos;ve never seen you this down .
yeah , well , people change .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , don &apos;t apologize .
break @-@ ups are terrible . i get it .
i should probably get going .
um , if you wanna spend any more of your free periods here ,
my door is open .
thanks , miss montgomery .
what &apos;s up ?
just heading home .
rosewood costume shop ?
yeah , i @-@ i thought i &apos;d check in with shana
about those queen of hearts costumes on the way .
you said you were done with this .
i know . i am .
liar .
i &apos;m following up .
she said the inventory could take a few weeks .
great . we &apos;ll come with .
emily , no .
the whole point of this is that i &apos;m protecting you ,
not the other way around .
no . doing things alone is what gets us in trouble . let &apos;s go .
are you this hard on caleb ?
seriously ? you &apos;re looking for sympathy
from the girl who &apos;s boyfriend took a bullet in the gut ?
spencer ?
is everything okay ?
i know that you &apos;re in there .
i &apos;m fine .
come on , open up the door .
you &apos;re not the only one that could use a little &quot; team sparia . &quot;
ezra &apos;s back .
spencer ...
i know that you don &apos;t want a friend right now ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that your friends don &apos;t need you .
i still don &apos;t understand why you care about this costume .
some girl wore it on the train .
we kinda tangled , and i wanna know who it was .
i &apos;m shana , by the way .
paige forgot her manners .
emily .
oh , so it &apos;s you in the flesh .
i &apos;m hanna .
about that costume ...
yeah , i checked . we can &apos;t give out that information .
it &apos;d be my ass .
you didn &apos;t think to mention this on the phone ?
must have slipped my mind .
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d be bringing your girlfriends .
do you have a restroom ?
in the back .
thanks .
so where are the queen of hearts costumes , anyway ?
i wanna see what all the fuss is about .
over here .
wow !
this is really pretty .
what is this , silk ?
try polyester .
i &apos;m really into fashion .
okay , i &apos;d love to chat , but--
no !
wait . um ...
what &apos;s this ?
little boy blue .
yeah , i really , really love this color .
i have to get that .
while you &apos;re with a customer ?
what is wrong with you ?
costumes .
let &apos;s go .
aria .
mrs. fitzgerald .
i wanted to thank you .
whatever you said or did , it worked .
wesley &apos;s come home .
he &apos;s going to be finishing the year at dillard .
oh . uh , i didn &apos;t do anything .
well , in any event , he &apos;s back where he belongs .
do you mind if i sit ?
i know we didn &apos;t get off on the right foot ,
but your generosity toward my son
in the midst of all this does mean something .
yeah , well , wes needed a place to stay .
i wasn &apos;t gonna leave him out on the street .
i meant ezra .
wes stayed with you ?
i take it you &apos;ve spoken with ezra .
i really don &apos;t wanna get into the middle of this .
i know this may sound hard to believe ,
but i was acting in ezra &apos;s best interest .
he was in high school .
just think of yourself , aria .
how would you feel waking up to that kind of responsibility ?
my parents respect me enough to involve me in the decision .
i &apos;m sure they do .
i must admit , i admire your courage--
staying with ezra while his life turns upside down .
it will change things , to say the least .
especially for someone like ezra .
you know he &apos;ll make malcolm the center of his life .
and there &apos;s maggie ...
well , i won &apos;t keep you .
i love you , too .
caleb &apos;s gonna try and i.d. the credit card numbers
when he gets back from his aunt &apos;s house .
what &apos;s wrong ?
do you think toby would ever cheat on spencer ?
wait , what ?
it &apos;s the only thing i can think of
that might explain how upset she &apos;s been .
toby is as loyal as a labrador . i don &apos;t think he &apos;d cheat .
and neither would paige .
who said anything about paige ?
uh , your face .
i was only worried about it
when i saw her with shana .
there was some serious tension in that room .
look , i know , and it &apos;s all my fault .
i should have never put that thought in your head .
are you even sure shana &apos;s gay ? she barely looked at me .
that &apos;s the criteria ?
i &apos;m just saying .
you should have seen those chicks fighting over me at the bar .
anyway , it &apos;s like me and caleb &apos;s dad .
just because we &apos;ve all gotten in the habit of
thinking the worst of people
doesn &apos;t mean it true .
is everything okay ?
ezra &apos;s back .
and so is miss fitz @-@ scary .
oh , i didn &apos;t order that .
i did .
boyfriend busy ?
i am not gonna discuss my personal life with you .
i &apos;m just trying to make small talk .
yet something tell me that i should talk with my lawyer present .
no , there &apos;s no need to make it official .
all right . you wanna talk ? talk .
don &apos;t get upset . i &apos;m here as a friend .
but we &apos;re not friends .
we have a history .
a history that &apos;s ancient , as far as i &apos;m concerned .
listen , i know my record isn &apos;t spotless ,
especially with you ,
but i take my job very seriously .
i don &apos;t want anything to get in the way ,
especially something outrageous .
outrageous ?
teenagers aren &apos;t aware of the ramifications of what they say .
if it &apos;s outrageous , why do you seem so nervous ?
in a town like this ,
an accusation like that would be the end of me .
is there any truth to it ?
of course not .
what do you think ?
i think you bought a glass of wine for the wrong person .
do you mind if i join you ?
no .
i was hoping we could discuss our little road trip .
look , i was wrong .
you wanted to help me and i used you to get at mona .
i &apos;m sorry .
you shouldn &apos;t be .
i deserved to be used .
look , i &apos;d be lying if i said i came to you
purely in the name of mental health .
mona had told me about your break @-@ up ,
and i think ...
i think that part of me hoped that with toby out of the picture ,
that i finally stood a chance .
but it was wrong of me to try and swoop in so quickly .
i let feelings cloud my judgment .
and i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
your anger toward mona ...
is she the one who came between you and toby ?
yeah , you could say that .
forgive me . it &apos;s none of my business .
i &apos;ll leave you .
wren , wait .
it may have been about mona ,
but something good came out of it .
it was nice
being with you .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m not the only one of us who thought so .
do you fancy taking another stab at dinner ?
anywhere but lewisburg ?
since when do you care what that hose @-@ beast thinks ?
she wasn &apos;t wrong , han .
now with malcolm and maggie in the picture ,
everything &apos;s gonna be complicated .
god , how did this even happen ?
i mean , i &apos;m actually having
a conversation about my boyfriend &apos;s son .
it &apos;s like my relationship
went from high school to minivan overnight .
and now @-@ now i have to go to his apartment
and have dinner with him and act like everything &apos;s okay .
okay , aria , take a deep breath .
yeah , you have to give it more than ten minutes .
you guys have been through so much .
i know .
okay , but don &apos;t you think
it &apos;s a little weird that he didn &apos;t call ?
i mean , wes even thought that was strange .
hold up . his little brother ?
aria , is there something that you &apos;re not telling us ?
what ? no .
okay , yes , fine , maybe i went there
for like 2.5 seconds , but no .
no , i just missed ezra .
it seems like you &apos;re talking to everyone in that family
except for the one that matters .
it was this beautiful crystal paperweight ,
with these lavender petals suspended inside .
i never would have pegged you as a thief .
well , i was a terrible one .
i felt so guilty , as soon as i got home from my nana &apos;s house ,
that i actually--
i buried it in the backyard .
it &apos;s probably still there .
i hate to cut the night short ,
but i promised a colleague i &apos;d cover his shift for him .
oh , go . save some lives .
i had a lovely night .
yeah , i did , too .
i &apos;m sorry .
i hardly think that &apos;s fair .
i &apos;ll be on my way .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to tell aria
about how hiding my son from me was in everyone &apos;s best interest ?
best interest . that &apos;s what you called it , right , mom ?
malcolm &apos;s every need has been seen to .
oh , god . you &apos;re unbelievable .
i can go ...
no , no , no . stay , stay .
we can continue this another time .
like when i &apos;m alone ?
so you can try to manipulate aria out of my life again ?
ezra , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
i &apos;m so sick of this .
i &apos;m not going to apologize for loving you .
and i &apos;m sure as hell not
going to let you swoop into my son &apos;s life
and pretend the past seven years never happened .
well , you &apos;ve made your feelings perfectly clear .
you &apos;re forgetting something .
the key . i know you had one made .
i am so sorry that you had to see that .
any idea why shana got in trouble
for emailing confidential information ?
i needed to find out who rented those costumes .
so badly you &apos;re willing to risk somebody &apos;s job ?
it &apos;s complicated , okay ?
try me .
there &apos;s more to this than you &apos;re letting on .
is it something about mona ?
did she kill garrett ?
i don &apos;t know !
look , i know you and caleb are trying to bust her ,
but this might be bigger than mona , okay ?
she could be working for someone .
someone like who ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
at first we thought it was cece ,
but now--now we don &apos;t know what to think .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
&apos;cause i was being protective .
same as you and caleb .
now it &apos;s your turn .
shana ?
em ...
no , we can &apos;t be half honest .
i saw the way you two looked at each other ............
we dated ...
this summer , while you were working in haiti .
three weeks .
if it was over , why would you lie about it ?
because i didn &apos;t wanna hurt you .
emily , believe me .
it &apos;s over .
she was a substitute ,
at a time when i never thought i &apos;d get the real thing .
i love you .
hey , hanna . it &apos;s me .
i just saw wilden .
we need to talk about what you told me earlier , okay ?
call me as soon as you get this .
love you . bye .
what &apos;d it take to get you out of bed ?
i ... just needed some fresh air .
spencer ...
i know it &apos;s none of my business ,
but no company is better than bad company .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i bought wren that cologne .
hey ... don &apos;t you wanna give that to goodwill or something ?
knowing my mother , there &apos;s probably is a tracking device on that .
does malcolm know that you &apos;re his dad ?
not yet .
it &apos;s a big step , but we &apos;re trying to ease him into the idea .
well , whatever you decide , i &apos;m here for you .
thank you .
so if my memory serves me correct ,
i &apos;m pretty sure that i won the last movie night coin toss ,
which means that we are watching anything but chinatown .
one of these nights you are going to
stay awake through the entire movie .
one of these nights is not tonight .
i &apos;m gonna make popcorn .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , slow down , slow down .
no . no , it &apos;s okay . i got time .
it &apos;s maggie .
is everything okay ?
uh , i don &apos;t know , uh , but we will figure something out .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my mom owns maggie &apos;s condo , and she &apos;s selling it .
what ?
no , no , no , no . look , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
look , you got rights and nothing--
nothing &apos;s gonna happen overnight .
is here a problem ?
have you been drinking ?
what are you doing ?
just answer the question .
you know very well i haven &apos;t .
i know you had a drink at the table .
please step out of the car .
where are you going with this ?
are you refusing an order from an officer of the law ?
step out of the car please .
we need to talk about hanna .
can you keep hanna quiet or not ?
if you wanna continue this discussion , call my lawyer .
i &apos;m not the only one with secrets .
you talk , i talk ,
and you could lose a lot more than your boyfriend .
don &apos;t threaten me .
hey ... let go of me !
this is nothing compared to what i &apos;ll do if hanna talks .
i wonder how your lieutenant will respond
when he hears you &apos;re threatening a child .
he &apos;s not going to .
think this through , ashley .
how do you live with yourself ?
hey , we &apos;re not done here !
get out of my way !
i can &apos;t let you go !
get out of my way !
either you shut hanna up , or i will !
cece ?
where are you going ?
anywhere . fast .
is this about wilden ?
ya think ?
emily , i thought you could keep a secret .
is there anyone in this town that you didn &apos;t tell ?
i saw a picture of you , wilden , and ali on a sailboat .
yeah , she thought he was cute ,
so she asked him if he &apos;d take us for a ride .
then why lie about it ?
i don &apos;t have time to talk about this !
you &apos;re not the only one that &apos;s scared , okay ?
please . if there &apos;s something i need to know ...
i thought wilden got ali pregnant
and killed her to keep it a secret .
so is it true ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s true .
wilden &apos;s sure going out of his way to deny it ,
and if there &apos;s one thing ali could do ,
it &apos;s tell a good lie .
if you thought he killed her , why not turn him in ?
oh , to who ? one of his pals on the force ?
i didn &apos;t know who i could trust .
jason said he saw you at his house
the night ali disappeared .
he told you that ?
god , this is so messed up .
why were you there ?
ali called .
she was freaking out about some videos .
everyone wanted them .
spencer &apos;s big sister more than anyone .
when i showed up , she begged me to talk to ali .
so i did . then ali left to go get them .
next day ... she was missing .
who took that picture ?
you three on the sailboat . who took it ?
melissa hastings .
melissa !
melissa !
melissa !
help ! melissa !
somebody , please !
melissa ! can you hear me ? !
melissa , please !
melissa !
please !
melissa !
somebody , please !
what happened ?
what happened ?
god , mom ! you almost gave me a heart attack !
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
i think i might have killed detective wilden .
i &apos;m gonna stay with you tonight .
thank god i got your text .
this was revenge .
for what happened with mona ?
for hooking up with wren .
you ... ?
it &apos;s a long story .
why would mona care about you and wren ?
can you call hanna and emily ?
i need them to come over .
sure . why ?
i know who &apos;s helping mona .
i don &apos;t want you seeing this .
look , i &apos;m not letting you do this alone .
mom ... where &apos;s wilden ?
i don &apos;t know .
