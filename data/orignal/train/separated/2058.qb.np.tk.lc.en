you think that i don &apos;t know that
all your problems are solved
if i tell them that harvey did this ?
i would be lying if i said it didn &apos;t cross my mind
that maybe mike should think about making a deal .
and now that they &apos;ve taken in your father ,
you can &apos;t tell me that the thought hasn &apos;t crossed yours too .
thinking about it and talking about it aren &apos;t the same thing .
i got a call about an article
on mike ross &apos; meteoric rise to junior partner .
the problem is there is no mike ross .
you reported it anonymously ,
because you didn &apos;t want to look bad .
i reported it anonymously
because i was ashamed that it happened on my watch .
i loved you ,
and you let some stupid secret come between us
because you couldn &apos;t trust me with it .
all you have to do is admit what you did ,
and all of this goes away .
sheila came forward .
she admitted she was the one who wrote the e @-@ mail .
you and your partners are hereby subpoenaed
to hand over every single document in the entire firm .
harvey , i &apos;m not sure this is the best idea .
we need to know what she has . what &apos;s the downside ?
the downside is that we move up the trial .
mike , this trial &apos;s coming , whether we like it or not .
and the more time we have knowing her game plan ,
the better off we &apos;ll be .
holy shit .
what ?
i took the lasts with this guy .
so what ?
so he can give gibbs something
she doesn &apos;t even have on me yet .
yes , but to do that , he &apos;d be ruining his whole career .
which means , even if he remembers you ,
he &apos;s more afraid of you than you are of him .
so calm the hell down .
all right , let &apos;s make this quick .
your honor , making it quick is exactly
what we &apos;re asking you to do .
she hasn &apos;t handed over her discovery yet .
i &apos;m still building a case ,
and we haven &apos;t even set a date for the trial yet .
and the check &apos;s in the mail , and all the other things
people say when they don &apos;t wanna do what they have to do .
what i have to do is protect the public
from the likes of you .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
get that discovery to them by the end of the day .
in that case , we &apos;d like to ask that the day of the trial
be set in the next two weeks .
objection , your honor , she &apos;s had weeks to--
you can &apos;t have it both ways , mr. specter .
you can &apos;t demand discovery and ask for more time .
trial starts in two weeks .
jessica , we have a problem .
thanks for pointing that out , jack .
i had no idea .
i &apos;m not talking about the trial .
i &apos;m talking about this .
what the hell is that ?
an op @-@ ed in the journal .
&quot; there is no way on god &apos;s green earth
&quot; that at least one of the three name partners
&quot; at pearson specter litt
didn &apos;t know what was going on under their own roof . &quot;
&quot; god &apos;s green earth . &quot; who wrote it ?
a partner at skaaden .
if it wasn &apos;t them , it would &apos;ve been someone else ,
because they smell blood .
i don &apos;t care what they smell .
i &apos;ve given up everything for this firm ,
and if anybody tries to take it from me ,
they &apos;ll have to pry it from my cold , dead hands .
and what &apos;s your goddamn plan ?
excuse me ?
jessica , our reputation &apos;s taking a beating .
we need to rehabilitate it .
that means pro bono , and you know it .
one free case is not going to move the needle ,
no matter how worthy it is .
i &apos;m not talking about one case .
i &apos;m talking about a series of cases
for our clients &apos; most valued charities .
oh , this better not be another scheme , jack .
you think this is a move ?
now why would i ever think that after you tried
to take my firm from me six times in the last ten minutes ?
i did try to take over from you .
but i &apos;ve been at this firm my entire career ,
and i am fighting for it now .
and you think i &apos;m not ?
i &apos;m sure you are .
but you &apos;re also the reason i &apos;m holding this indictment
of our firm in the first place ,
because what they &apos;re saying is true .
and don &apos;t you dare try to tell me
you didn &apos;t know about mike ross ,
because we both know you did .
what the hell do you want ?
oh , since you made me come all the way down here ,
i thought i &apos;d save the taxpayers some money
on hiring a server .
a server for what ?
for your fiancée . i &apos;d like to ask her some questions .
get the hell out of here .
you want to serve a subpoena , you serve it to her .
well , then i wouldn &apos;t get to see the look on your face .
did you really think i wouldn &apos;t hit you where it hurts ?
i was saving your weakest spot for last .
have a nice day , gentlemen .
what ?
you know what .
it &apos;s time we give that woman a taste of her own medicine .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
it means we hire a lawyer from an outside firm ,
and we dig up dirt on someone she cares about .
are you out of your mind ?
you saw what she did to donna .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before she tries
to pull the same shit with rachel .
mike--
harvey , you &apos;re the one that taught me that
when someone puts pressure on you , you put it back on them .
i also taught you if you &apos;re gonna take a swing at someone ,
you better knock them out ,
and if we pull the shit that you &apos;re talking about
and get caught ,
all that happens is i get thrown off this case ,
and it &apos;s game over .
harvey , i can &apos;t stand by and watch while the people
i care about get attacked , and neither could you .
mike , i promise you ,
i will be there for rachel every step of the way .
in the meantime ,
i need you going through every one of those boxes .
because if that woman is ready to go to trial ,
she &apos;s got a lot more than an e @-@ mail
from louis &apos; girlfriend .
第五季第十三集
rachel zane .
yes ?
my name is anita gibbs . i &apos;m the--
yes , i know who you are .
i &apos;m flattered you came for me personally .
but we aren &apos;t supposed to talk for another three days ,
and i don &apos;t have my lawyer with me , so--
this isn &apos;t a formal interrogation .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
then i &apos;ll tell you what is necessary .
you &apos;re going to put in writing that anything i say to you
is inadmissible .
i suspected you &apos;d say that , which is why i prepared this .
i understand if you &apos;d prefer to ask somebody who &apos;s actually
completed law school if that &apos;s legally binding .
i &apos;m perfectly capable of determining
if this is legally binding or not .
and i &apos;m not going to let you
bait me into saying anything to you .
well , that &apos;s fine with me .
i &apos;m not looking for you to talk .
i &apos;m looking for you to listen .
well , it &apos;s official .
no matter what happens at trial ,
this firm isn &apos;t surviving mike ross .
i know about the editorial , louis .
what editorial ?
i &apos;m talking about the summer associate applications .
how bad is it ?
three people .
not just any three people , the three people
that never should &apos;ve made it to harvard in the first place .
goddamn it .
sheila &apos;s sending us the bottom of the barrel .
she &apos;s giving us the sludge that grows
at the bottom of the barrel .
then ...
i think it might be time to start looking beyond harvard .
yeah , that &apos;s a great idea . you know what ?
we should start shitting in the urinals while we &apos;re at it .
i &apos;m not talking about the university of arizona , louis .
i &apos;m talking about columbia , yale , stanford--
and i &apos;m talking about appearances .
we break our rule and suddenly hire outside of harvard--
we already broke our rule for rachel with columbia .
please , that was different , and you know it .
no . it was because of mike ,
which makes it the same goddamn thing .
one way or another , we are going to keep this firm going .
so if you don &apos;t wanna go outside of harvard to do that ,
then i suggest you go up to cambridge ,
and convince sheila to start feeding us
some worthy goddamn applicants .
okay . so first you pick me up ,
then you bring me to my favorite café .
what can i say ? i do my homework .
as do i , ms. gibbs , which is why i &apos;m not falling for you
pretending to be my friend .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not your friend .
but i am willing to pull some strings
to get the man you love into columbia law school .
and if you think that i &apos;m gonna buy that fairy tale ,
the only strings you &apos;re trying to pull are mine .
the only fairy tale here is the one where you believe
you get out of this thing unscathed .
okay . we &apos;re done here .
rachel , i &apos;m just trying to give you your options .
i know my options .
then you know you have no spousal privilege ,
which means you &apos;re going to have to tell the truth ,
and put your fiancée away .
or you &apos;re gonna have to plead the fifth .
or i can say that he didn &apos;t do this .
perjuring yourself is the same as taking the fifth ,
as far as your future is concerned .
what the hell does that mean ?
i &apos;m saying that someday you &apos;re going to face
the character and fitness committee of the bar ,
and i seriously doubt they &apos;re going to admit somebody
who did that .
are you trying to intimidate a witness ?
because yes , someday i will face that committee ,
but tomorrow they &apos;re going to be hearing about you .
i &apos;m your only way out of this mess .
just give me the people who are actually responsible for it ,
and i &apos;ll see to it that both you and mike can practice law
for the rest of your lives .
please tell me that &apos;s the last one .
it is .
except for the hundred in the other conference room .
holy shit .
yeah .
trial strategy 101 .
bury the other side in paperwork ,
so they can &apos;t find what they &apos;re looking for .
and what are we looking for ?
gibbs &apos; trial strategy .
somewhere in these boxes are the pieces
that she is putting together to make her case .
we find them , we know specifically what we have to fight .
and what specifically might those things look like ?
witness lists , interviews , anything to do with lola jensen ,
utility bills from when i was supposed to be at harvard--
wait , wait , wait . slow down .
why are you writing this down ?
so i can remember it .
and because we need a system .
and because you &apos;ve never done doc review before .
i don &apos;t believe it .
how you &apos;ve been a legal secretary this long ,
and never have done doc review .
i will tell you how .
because i &apos;m the best damn person you &apos;ve ever seen
at reading people , anticipating needs ,
and generally dominating everything .
so , in this situation ,
you &apos;re going to be absolutely no help at all .
none whatsoever .
i &apos;m getting rachel .
what &apos;s that ?
what does it look like ?
it looks like something i don &apos;t have time for .
well , make time .
jessica , we &apos;ve got a thousand boxes of shit to go through ,
and i &apos;ve got trial in two weeks .
what ?
that &apos;s right . the date &apos;s been set .
so i &apos;m sorry that i can &apos;t have a doughnut with you right now ,
but i &apos;ve got something a little more important to deal with .
harvey , i understand , but our clients are being circled .
our reputation &apos;s getting tanked ,
and we &apos;re getting sent shit associates .
and mike ross is facing prison .
and you &apos;re handling one thing ,
while i &apos;m handling everything else .
jessica--
no , never mind , harvey .
it &apos;s clear that you really don &apos;t care
about keeping this firm together .
i resigned to keep this firm together .
well , it sure doesn &apos;t seem to be working out that way ,
does it ?
great , i &apos;ll have my secretary set up a meeting for monday .
if that meeting &apos;s about your pro bono bullshit ,
cancel it .
what ?
you said it yourself , jack .
other firms smell blood .
well , you don &apos;t get a shark to back off by playing nice ,
you do it by clubbing him in the face .
they come after our clients , we go after theirs .
clients aren &apos;t the ones writing editorials
for &quot; the wall street journal , &quot; jack .
you want to poach an attorney .
i wanna poach a whole goddamn department .
that is definitely another way to go .
it &apos;s the only way to go ,
because if we didn &apos;t do what we &apos;re saying we didn &apos;t do ,
this is what we do .
i get it .
you &apos;re trying to convince the world we &apos;re innocent .
jack , i don &apos;t give a shit if my enemies think
i &apos;m innocent or not .
i give a shit whether they think they can take me down ,
which is why i &apos;m not going to cower in some pro bono corner ,
trying to convince them that i &apos;m friendly .
i &apos;m going to kick some ass ,
and remind them that i &apos;m fierce .
there you are . i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
rachel , we need your help . where have you been ?
with anita gibbs .
what ? how did you let that happen ?
because she ambushed me on the street ,
with a document that said our conversation
would be inadmissible .
and if she did that is because
she didn &apos;t want to talk to you ,
she wanted to get in your head .
mike , i know what she wanted to do .
what did she say ?
she said that she could get you into columbia ,
and that you could be a lawyer after all this is over .
rachel , she &apos;s lying--
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
well , we &apos;ve already been over this .
the only way she is gonna help us is if we help her
put harvey and jessica away .
yes , mike , i know that , but we didn &apos;t go over the part
where i don &apos;t get into the bar because i took the fifth .
oh , goddamn it !
this is exactly why i wanted harvey to be there .
she got into your head .
she didn &apos;t got into my head .
she dangled our dream in front of me ,
and i know that we can &apos;t have that .
it doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t handle this .
it doesn &apos;t seem like you &apos;re handling it .
i am .
you &apos;re crying .
no . i &apos;m releasing my emotions so that i can persevere
instead of denying them and losing my mind .
which i can &apos;t do today ,
because i have a meeting with the dean .
now , i came in here to be alone
so i can deal with my shit ,
so if you don &apos;t mind , i would like to be alone
so i can deal with my shit .
hey , did you find something in the discovery ?
yeah , sure as hell did .
i just discovered that gibbs picked up rachel .
what ? she arrested her ?
no , she pulled up to the curb with some document .
i don &apos;t give a shit what she pulled up with .
rachel should know not to go with her .
yeah , and that would &apos;ve been an excellent thing
for her lawyer to tell her , except her lawyer wasn &apos;t there .
excuse me ?
you promised me
that you would be with her every step of the way .
i promised i &apos;d represent her at a deposition ,
not babysit her 24 hours a day .
maybe instead of getting mad at rachel ,
it is time for us to figure out how to go after gibbs . 【 轴 】
this again .
yes , this again .
i told you she was gonna go after rachel , and now she has .
and i told you if you &apos;re gonna go after someone ,
you better knock them out .
then you better figure out a way to knock gibbs out soon ,
because if you don &apos;t , i will .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
what ?
you thought you could lie to my face and get away with it ?
i never lied to you .
really ?
because you swore
you wouldn &apos;t come forward about that e @-@ mail ,
but you did .
and you you &apos;re pulling this associate shit .
i didn &apos;t come forward . they found me .
and i &apos;m not pulling any associate shit .
then what do you call this pathetic excuse
of a candidates list ?
i call it inevitable .
because our students can read .
the editorial .
yes .
the editorial .
so you &apos;re not sending us sludge .
louis , i &apos;m not doing anything .
your firm is being investigated
by the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
and no one is going to risk their career on a place
that may not even exist in a month .
they might , if you convince them to .
louis , i can &apos;t do that .
sheila , please .
i came here once before , hoping for a second chance
and you wouldn &apos;t give it to me .
what does that have to do with this ?
because if we &apos;d gotten back together then ,
i wouldn &apos;t even be at the firm now , but i am .
and it &apos;s all i have .
i understand you not giving me a second chance then .
but i &apos;m begging you ...
give my firm one now .
louis , even if i wanted to , it won &apos;t work .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
because they &apos;re going to ask me if i think it &apos;s a good idea
for them to work at pearson specter litt , and i don &apos;t .
sheila--
louis .
please don &apos;t ask me to lie to them .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just wondering if you &apos;re gonna stay in here
going over stuff all day .
what else would i be doing ? going to the ball game ?
i don &apos;t know , harvey ,
i thought maybe you &apos;d be doing something to get anita gibbs
to back off rachel .
donna , she threatened to go to the bar .
it &apos;s a bullshit hypothetical that she couldn &apos;t do
until after rachel testified .
which is after the trial starts ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m goddamn working on .
harvey , all i &apos;m saying is
that when mike gets worked up about something ,
he doesn &apos;t tend to make the best decisions .
well , if he doesn &apos;t work on the discovery ,
he &apos;s gonna go to jail , so ...
what do you want me to do ?
i don &apos;t know , harvey .
but you better at least go talk to anita gibbs ,
because mike gave you a warning loud and clear .
if you don &apos;t do something , he will .
jack , i don &apos;t often come outside for my coffee ,
but when i do is because i &apos;m feeling the need
for a little alone time .
well , i came out here because i knew you wouldn &apos;t want
anyone hearing what i have to say .
are you here to tell me you can get the job done ?
no , i &apos;m here to tell you if you want me to get it done ,
you &apos;re going to have to open your wallet .
i &apos;m not paying you more money ,
just to get you to poach a department .
i &apos;m not talking about me .
i &apos;m talking the real estate division of baker hostetler .
how much do they want ?
double what they &apos;re making .
are you insane ?
that &apos;s what broke dewey ballantine .
you can &apos;t have two classes of partners .
then we can &apos;t poach a department ,
because they &apos;re the only ones even willing to come here ,
considering what &apos;s going on .
then make the offer .
and let me have my goddamn coffee in peace .
ms. scott ,
there &apos;s a harvey specter here to see you .
he says it &apos;s urgent .
send him in .
i don &apos;t believe it .
you have some balls pretending to be harvey to get in here .
well , you did call me &quot; baby harvey &quot; once .
i don &apos;t give a shit what i called you .
get out ! now !
scottie , scottie , please .
listen , i knew you would never agree to see me ,
and i need to talk to you .
about what ?
i need someone to bring an action
against anita gibbs &apos; sister .
are you insane ?
listen to me . she &apos;s not just coming after me .
she &apos;s coming after my fiancée .
i don &apos;t care .
if i do that , i might as well call the woman up ,
and tell her that i &apos;m in on your whole bullshit too .
we get someone from your firm--
not to mention
i told harvey that i never
even wanted to hear your name again .
he didn &apos;t tell you about that , did he ?
well , i guess he hasn &apos;t changed ,
because he didn &apos;t tell me about you
until it was too late either .
so i am sorry about your fiancée ,
but i need you to go now .
scottie , this woman is not gonna stop
until she gets what she wants .
and what she wants is harvey .
so i &apos;m not asking you to do this for me and rachel .
i &apos;m asking you to do it for him .
is that an invitation to your bar mitzvah ?
because i &apos;m busy that day .
it &apos;s a motion to have you sanctioned
for improperly contacting a witness .
i didn &apos;t improperly contact anyone .
oh , bullshit .
you got rachel zane alone so you could
offer her a deal to turn on me .
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
you listen to me .
you &apos;ve been pulling shit like this
from the second this thing started .
you denied my client access to his attorney ,
you fabricated charges against donna ,
and now you &apos;re tampering with a witness .
and all witness tampering would do is hurt my own case ,
and why on god &apos;s green earth would i do that ?
why did you just say ?
i said you &apos;re insane if you think that--
no , you said , &quot; on god &apos;s green earth , &quot;
which is exactly what that editorial said .
i remember because i thought ,
&quot; what person under 80 uses that phrase ? &quot;
well , looks like i found her .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you sure as hell do , because you planted that goddamn thing .
you have any proof ?
no , you don &apos;t .
but even if i did plant that ,
it would only have been
because there &apos;s no way that one of you
did not know what was going on .
and until one of you admits that ,
i &apos;m going to take apart your firm brick by brick .
so you want to file that thing ? you go ahead .
it &apos;s not going to stop me for one second .
rachel , please .
have a seat .
thank you , dean .
i have to say i &apos;ve so been looking forward
to my first student review .
and ever since your first interview here ,
you &apos;ve done nothing but impress me .
which is why i &apos;m sorry to have to bring this up now .
bring what up ?
the fact that your last lsat score was significantly higher
than your previous ones .
that is because i studied
incredibly hard the last time .
did you study hard ?
or did your fiancée study hard for you ?
you think mike took the lsat for me ?
i think he &apos;s been indicted
for more serious crimes than that .
and now there are allegations
that he &apos;s taken the lsats for people .
i can &apos;t believe this . i took that test myself .
and i have a responsibility to protect
the reputation of this university .
and how exactly are you proposing
to protect that reputation ?
by expelling any dangers to it .
unless , of course , for some reason
these allegations against him are dropped .
anita gibbs called you , didn &apos;t she ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m simply giving you the courtesy of letting you know
that if i have to choose between your future and this university &apos;s ,
i &apos;m not choosing you .
well , then , please , tell ms. gibbs
thank you for the courtesy .
scottie , what are you doing here ?
i can &apos;t believe you sent him to me .
sent who ?
oh , don &apos;t give me that .
the last time you came to me ,
you said it was because mike made you .
well , this time , you made him .
i didn &apos;t made him do anything .
well , then , you taught him well , because he came to me
and pulled on my heart strings
to get me to do something for you ,
but this time the answer is no .
i am not going after anita gibbs .
scottie , i would never ask you to do something like that .
that &apos;s funny , because you asked me to throw a case
to keep mike from getting caught .
throwing a case doesn &apos;t put a target on your back .
if you really wanted to keep a target off my back ,
you never would &apos;ve told me about mike in the first place .
scottie , i didn &apos;t tell him to do that .
well , then , i guess you two are having the same problem we did .
you don &apos;t talk to each other .
since you chose him over me it &apos;s not my problem anymore .
i didn &apos;t chose him over you .
yes , you did .
and whether you choose to admit it or not ,
it was mike &apos;s secret that broke us up in the first place .
you let her in here without telling me ?
i was in the conference room , going over discovery .
what are you going to do ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do , but whatever it is ,
i &apos;m gonna do it right now .
harvey , calm down .
i &apos;m not gonna calm down ,
you told me to go after gibbs
to stop mike from doing something stupid , and i did ,
and all that did was waste our time like i said it would .
harvey . gibbs is attacking rachel ,
the woman he loves .
you of all people should be able to understand that .
i don &apos;t give a shit .
he had no right to go after someone i love .
okay , you know what , harvey ?
mike is the one on trial here , not scottie .
and all he did was ask her to do something .
so maybe the thing that you &apos;re really upset about
is that she was right .
well , how did it go ?
we &apos;ve known each other a long time , jack ,
and i &apos;d really like to help ,
but it &apos;s not gonna happen .
you said if i could get them double--
i said it would take at least double just to get me to ask .
i did , and they laughed me out of the room .
what if i could get you more ?
there &apos;s no number that &apos;s going to get them
to come to pearson specter
because they don &apos;t believe there &apos;s gonna be a firm to come to .
then why did you ask to meet me here ?
because after i asked them about your offer ,
i asked them about mine .
what are you talking about ?
i told them a former fraternity brother of mine ,
who happens to be a kick @-@ ass lawyer might be looking for a change .
you &apos;re offering me a job ?
jack , pearson specter &apos;s a sinking ship .
we &apos;ve taken on some water .
you &apos;ve taken on an ocean .
why the hell would you wanna stay there ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
because if that ship sinks ,
i &apos;ll find myself another job .
but if it doesn &apos;t ,
i have the chance to be one of the captains .
if i come to you now ,
i &apos;ll never be more than a lifer .
as my friend , tell me i &apos;m wrong .
you &apos;re not wrong .
don &apos;t tell me they printed out a special evening edition on us too .
not yet .
i read it ,
by the way ,
on the flight up to boston .
and did it fire you up ?
pissed me the hell off .
you couldn &apos;t get it done with sheila , could you ?
jessica , she didn &apos;t send us the candidates on that list .
they were the only three that even asked to be submitted ,
and it was because of bullshit like that .
people are scared to come here .
they are .
i tried to get sheila to make them unafraid , but i couldn &apos;t .
that &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all right , louis . it &apos;s not your fault .
once word got out about mike
this was bound to happen .
what i learned from hiring mike
was that not all great lawyers went to harvard .
what are you saying ?
i contacted stanford , yale ,
columbia , penn , and all the rest ...
top 20 law schools .
i officially opened up the doors to pearson specter litt .
i know how much you hated to do that , louis ,
but sometimes we need to do what we have to ...
to survive .
is there anything else i can do ?
no , there isn &apos;t .
right now , we just need to get through this trial ,
and pray to god that harvey gets
mike goddamn ross off the hook .
you &apos;re doing dishes .
so ?
so you hate doing dishes ,
which means something &apos;s wrong .
nothing &apos;s wrong .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t even know if i should say it ,
because the last time i did you got so mad .
you thought i was gonna leave you .
and you say you want me to share things with you ,
but i don &apos;t know if you do ,
because when i do
you seem to get so upset that i--
i get it . you want to talk about making a deal .
i don &apos;t know what i wanna do .
i just--
she said that she could get you into columbia ,
and you &apos;re right .
it got into my head .
rachel , we &apos;ve been over this .
she was lying .
that was before i knew she was able to get to the dean .
what are you talking about ?
i had my meeting with him today ,
and i thought he was going to tell me
how well i &apos;ve been doing , and instead ...
he threatened to expel me .
okay .
okay , that--that doesn &apos;t mean that it was gibbs .
you weren &apos;t there .
no , i wasn &apos;t there , all right ?
but it &apos;s not crazy to assume that they would question
whether or not you knew about me without talking to gibbs .
is it crazy for them to mention a crime
you haven &apos;t even been accused of without talking to gibbs ?
what ?
they said there are rumors
of you taking the lsats for people
and they &apos;re accusing you of doing that for me .
well ... at least now i know what i need to do .
harvey .
i know how we can stop gibbs from pressuring rachel .
does it involve going to scottie without telling me ?
harvey .
goddamn it , you had no right .
i had every right ,
because i knew gibss would keep crossing lines ,
and that &apos;s exactly what she did .
what are you talking about ?
she manipulated the dean of columbia
into threatening to expel rachel .
where &apos;s your proof ?
they accused her of having me take the lsats for her ,
and the only problem is , there &apos;s no record of me
ever having being accused of that .
the guy you saw in court .
yes , his name is david green .
he must &apos;ve told gibbs about me ,
and then she used that
to get the dean to strong @-@ arm rachel .
that &apos;s abuse of power .
i told you , the only problem with that theory is ,
david green tells gibbs about you ,
and his career is done .
then he must &apos;ve told her anonymously .
which doesn &apos;t help us , &apos; cause we still don &apos;t have
any proof that she contacted the dean .
no , we don &apos;t , but it wouldn &apos;t be that hard for me to get .
no , it could be a setup . it &apos;s too risky .
this whole goddamn thing is too risky ,
but right now rachel &apos;s future is in jeopardy ,
and if i have to risk tacking on a few years to save her ,
is not even a close call .
all right . do what you have to do .
just don &apos;t get caught .
you &apos;re knocking .
that means it &apos;s either bad news or you want something .
i couldn &apos;t get the department .
don &apos;t tell me .
they said we &apos;re in no position to poach anybody .
that &apos;s exactly what they said ,
right before they offered me a job .
so you &apos;re here to tell me you took it .
i &apos;m here to ask you if you want me to take it .
what the hell difference does it make what i want ?
jessica , when i left boston , people said i was a traitor
and that i thought i was too good for my own hometown .
well , it wasn &apos;t true .
but i knew the real test for me
wasn &apos;t making it in my own hometown .
it was making it in the toughest city
in the world , and as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
i haven &apos;t done that yet .
you want to be made name partner .
i wanna know if it &apos;ll ever even be on the table .
i could say yes to that right now ,
but how would you know you could trust me ?
i have no other choice .
and how do i know i can trust you ?
what &apos;s this ?
you know what it is .
it &apos;s what daniel hardman has on you .
now you have it too .
david green .
what are you doing here ?
so you do remember me .
of course i do .
you &apos;re the guy we &apos;re prosecuting .
the fake lawyer .
oh , i &apos;m more than that and you know it .
what are you talking about ?
you hired me because i &apos;m smart .
what you don &apos;t know is that i have a photographic memory ,
which means i have your drivers license number
from seven years ago memorized .
not that it matters , because i also made a copy .
like i made a copy of all my clients &apos; licenses .
that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
maybe not , but i also remember every answer i put down
on a 104 question test .
if that &apos;s not proof , i don &apos;t know what is .
what do you want ?
i want proof that anita gibbs &apos; pressuring the dean of columbia
to expel rachel zane .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can .
okay , they went to law school together .
there &apos;s your connection .
circumstantial public record not good enough .
i do what you &apos;re asking and get caught ,
and my career at the u.s. attorney &apos;s office is over .
i give what i have to the d.a. ,
and your career as a lawyer is over .
if you do that , you only implicate yourself .
yeah , maybe you didn &apos;t notice , asshole ,
but i &apos;m already on trial , and now you &apos;re coming
after the woman i love .
and the truth is you don &apos;t deserve to practice law .
maybe i don &apos;t either , but she does .
and , believe me , when it comes to this ,
i really don &apos;t give a shit about me or you .
and what if i can &apos;t find what you &apos;re looking for ?
you know what , david ?
you might not have been smart enough to get 178 on the lsats ,
but i &apos;m pretty damn sure you &apos;re smart enough to do that .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna sign .
this says you &apos;re dropping a charge
of malicious prosecution in exchange for
me admitting a sanctionable offense .
and for backing the hell off going after rachel zane .
is this a joke ?
no .
and neither is getting the dean of columbia law
to do your dirty work .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you know exactly what we &apos;re talking about .
and unless you want us to tell the world
that you intimidated a witness
by colluding with your old law school buddy ,
you &apos;re going to sign that .
you don &apos;t have a shred of proof
that i had anyone do anything .
i have a copy of an anonymous tip sent to you ,
saying i took the lsat for people ,
and a record of a phone call from your office
to the dean of columbia ten minutes later .
that &apos;s no proof of anything .
it &apos;s proof enough for us to sue dean herrick
for every penny he &apos;s ever made .
you think when we get him in a deposition
he isn &apos;t gonna crack ?
you think you &apos;re pretty smart , don &apos;t you ?
smart enough to outwit a u.s. attorney .
and if we can do it here , what makes you think
we won &apos;t be able to do it in court ?
because court is not about bullshit like this .
it &apos;s about facts .
and the fact is , you &apos;re not a goddamn lawyer .
you have it done .
how &apos;d you know ?
because you &apos;re doing
that puffy chest thing you do
when you feel really good about yourself .
i do not do a puffy chest thing .
yes , you do . and relax ,
because i love you and your chest .
well , i love you and your chest .
oh , that came out wrong .
seriously , i meant your mind .
your brilliant legal mind .
well , if it wasn &apos;t for you and your brilliant legal mind ,
i might not be in law school right now .
no , i @-@ i understand that a lot of them already--
okay , well , if anyone wants to--
no , i see . i see .
maybe next year .
bye .
louis .
i need to talk to you for a second .
what now ?
jack soloff wants to know
if we &apos;ll someday consider making him name partner .
why the hell would we do that ?
because i sent him to poach a department
and instead they offered him a job .
i get it .
nobody wants to come here , so your answer
is to give our in @-@ house enemy
the promotion he &apos;s always wanted .
louis , you &apos;re the one who wanted me to do it before .
and you talked me out of it .
because you were right .
just like you used to be right about everything .
but now it seems like you &apos;re wrong about everything .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i just heard back from the last of those 20 schools .
and it turns out they have a lot more in common
with harvard that we thought , because none of them
wants to do anything to do with us
because our leadership sucks .
you watch yourself , louis .
i don &apos;t need to watch myself .
i need to light a fire under your ass .
because our future is slipping away ,
and offering jack name partner
or praying to god that harvey
just gets mike off the hook
isn &apos;t going to stop it from happening .
okay , louis .
you want to do something more than pray ,
harvey gets mike acquitted ,
then you get your ass back up to harvard
and you make sure sheila doesn &apos;t show up to that trial .
hi , donna .
is there , um ...
is there something i can help you with ?
i just wanted to say that i &apos;m sorry
about what happened with the dean .
and i &apos;m glad that mike took care of it .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry that ...
that i didn &apos;t come to you with this whole thing ,
but i @-@ i ...
they were pressuring you to turn on harvey
and based on our last conversation ,
you didn &apos;t think i was the right person to talk to about that .
as usual , you &apos;re right .
rachel , i got upset because i didn &apos;t want to think
about what i do if i have to choose
between my dad and harvey .
because this whole situation sucks .
and we may have to make hard choices ,
and i want you to know that no matter what you do ,
you &apos;re my friend .
and i will always love you .
i will always love you too .
thank you for coming .
i only came here because i don &apos;t want you
or mike ross or anyone else from this firm
showing up at my firm ever again .
so what can i do for you ?
i was thinking about what you said
about me not admitting things to myself
and i wanted to talk to you about it .
why ?
i wanted you to know the truth .
and what exactly is the truth ?
our relationship didn &apos;t end because of mike .
it ended because i wasn &apos;t ready to confront
what was wrong with me ,
and i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll ever be ready , but ...
i &apos;ve been seeing someone , and i wanted to tell you about it .
and why does it matter that i know that ?
because if i ever get out of this in one piece ,
i want to know if is okay to call you again .
harvey , it &apos;s always okay to call me .
i &apos;ve actually been going to therapy myself ,
and i don &apos;t know where i &apos;ll be
when this whole thing is over .
but i do hope that you get out of this thing in one piece .
excuse me .
hi , excuse me . i , uh--
i &apos;m not sure if you know who i am--
i worked here for two months , rachel .
i know who you are .
i just--i wanted to say that i know
that you got caught in the crossfire .
and i know how that feels .
and i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
rachel .
have you thought about what may happen when this is all over ?
you mean if mike goes to jail .
i mean even if he doesn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
even if he is acquitted , there is an excellent chance
he will be thrown out of the bar
and never be able to practice law again .
it wouldn &apos;t matter , because mike is prepared
to never practice law again anyway .
and sometimes people think they &apos;re prepared
and they &apos;re not .
i don &apos;t understand .
rachel , mike is going to have to watch you do
what he dreams of doing ,
and if he &apos;s anything like harvey ,
he probably thinks he can do it better than you .
and there is a possibility
that he might resent you for it .
i appreciate the advise .
but mike is not like that .
then i &apos;m sorry i overstepped my bounds .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
there &apos;s nothing i can do--
i &apos;m not here about the associates .
i need you to take this .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a ticket to argentina .
i need you to go there until the trial is over .
and why would i do that ?
because the prosecution has no power to subpoena you there .
let me get this straight . you want me to flee the country ,
so you can protect yourself .
i want you to flee the country so you can protect yourself .
louis--
sheila , you take that stand ,
and you &apos;re gonna say things that hurt us ,
which means harvey is going to say things that hurt you
and i will not be able to handle that .
the truth isn &apos;t gonna hurt me , louis .
isn &apos;t it true , ms. sazs , that while you claim
no one had unauthorized access to the harvard file room ,
there were times you were derelict in your duties ?
i &apos;ve never been derelict in my life .
then how does that explain the fact that there &apos;s a man
in this courtroom that had unauthorized access
to that very room ?
louis , please .
was it because you had
a relationship with that man ?
a relationship that ultimately failed ?
that &apos;s not--
relevant ?
it &apos;s more than goddamn relevant !
because when he broke up with you ,
you started this vicious rumor to get back at him .
that &apos;s a lie . those are all lies .
it is a lie that you had sex with that man ,
and left him alone in the supposedly
impenetrable harvard file room ?
louis , this could cost me my job .
goddamn it ! harvey is not gonna care .
no .
it &apos;s not a lie .
and if you did that with him ...
why should we believe
you didn &apos;t do that with others ?
i &apos;m sorry .
sheila , i &apos;m only trying to protect you .
if you really wanted to protect me ,
you wouldn &apos;t tell harvey those things in the first place .
he &apos;s gonna want me to tell him .
anything i know that would help .
you asked me to not make you lie .
please , don &apos;t ask me to lie to him .
okay , louis .
i &apos;ll go .
what are you still doing here ?
we &apos;ve still got a trial coming up .
i &apos;m gonna make any headway on my defense ,
i need to get going .
your defense ?
yes .
my defense .
are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
because there &apos;s an expression about that .
it says , &quot; if you &apos;re thinking it , you &apos;re a fool . &quot;
you heard her . she said ,
&quot; the fact is that i &apos;m not a goddamn lawyer . &quot;
well , the only way to change that fact is for a jury
to see me being a goddamn lawyer .
you try that , all they &apos;re gonna see
is someone going to prison .
that &apos;s bullshit . i can handle her .
you &apos;ve never even gone through
a criminal trial before .
oh , yeah , and when was the last time you did ?
how many years ago was it ?
i don &apos;t believe it . you think you &apos;re better than me ?
this isn &apos;t about who &apos;s better .
it &apos;s about who &apos;s better for this case .
and my life is on the line .
if i go down because of my call , i can take it .
if i go down because of yours , i can &apos;t .
this isn &apos;t just your life . this is all of ours .
well , like i said ,
it &apos;s my call and i &apos;m making it .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
this isn &apos;t over .
i just finished going through discovery
and we have a problem .
what is it ?
they found trevor .
