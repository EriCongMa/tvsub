We are in a land without magic,
But I'm bringing it.
Magic-- it's different here.
I'm not losing her again!
Where's my mom?
They fell through a portal.
I will find them.
I will always find them.
Emma, run!
Take them to the pit.
Can you hear me?
Do you need help?
Who are you?
My name's Cora.
Who are they?
King George.
Bring me his head!
King George's men are here on this ridge.
We have to move camp. They're coming for us.
No! We will not run.
We said we were gonna take the kingdom back,
and we can't do that with our tails between our legs.
No offense.
But matters have worsened.
The king has a new general.
Who is he?
They call him the Leviathan.
They say he attacks like a monster
striking from the depths of the sea.
You never see him coming
and you never survive.
We'll see about that.
How close is his army?
I'd say pretty close.
We should split up, divide them.
Exactly. Go. Go.
Aren't you coming?
He's after me.
You'll have a better chance of escaping on your own.
Don't worry. Meet me in two days' time at the cabin.
The cabin? Where she is?
Are you sure?
We're engaged.
I think it's about time you met my mother.
Go. Go.
What kind of general hides behind a mask?
Who are you really, Leviathan?
Leviathan?
That's what they're calling me?
Name's Lancelot.
Lancelot.
Of the round table?
Not anymore.
第三集
You sure she's gonna be okay?
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
What is this place? Where are we?
It's a little island our captors like
to think of as their haven.
Haven? From what?
The world's dangerous.
What's left of it, anyway.
Well, they can't keep us down here.
We didn't do anything wrong.
Neither did I.
Then why are you here?
I'm here because of something...
My daughter did.
The curse that ravaged this land--
She cast it.
Regina. You're Regina's mother?
Yes. But you've nothing to fear from me.
The apple fell very far from the tree.
You're from over there, aren't you?
How'd you get back?
Emma.
No.
Oh, Snow. You're awake. I'm so relieved.
As bad as you think Regina is,
this woman is worse.
Oh, Snow.
Sweet Snow, please.
Believe me,
Whatever she told you
isn't true.
I just want to help you.
Let's hear her out.
Emma.
Okay, right now we are at the bottom of a hole
with no other options,
and Henry is back in Storybrooke with Regina.
Who's Henry?
My son.
I kind of share him with Regina.
It's complicated.
Don't talk to her.
Enough!
Our leader requests an audience.
So what's on the agenda for Operation Scorpion?
What's Operation Scorpion?
The code name for our mission to find Emma and Snow.
Do you prefer Viper?
That was my second choice.
Henry, we need to talk.
Yeah, Scorpion's better.
No, it's not that.
It's...
I'm not coming with you.
But I-I thought we were gonna find Jefferson.
I already did.
What? Is he gonna help us?
No. No, Henry, he's not.
But why didn't you tell me you talked to him?
Because I didn't want to disappoint you.
I know you want to find your mom,
But Jefferson can't help us.
I need to find a way to restore the hat.
So why can't I help you look?
It'll require magic, Henry, and magic--
Always comes with a price.
I read the book, you know.
I'm sorry, but I just can't let you anywhere near this stuff.
If you really want to help me,
You'll go to school,
where I know you'll be safe. Okay?
Okay.
Why can't you just listen to me?
Why couldn't you have trusted me?
I was just trying to find a way to get us home.
I could've handled her.
Cora? Don't be so sure.
I've lived here, Emma.
I know this world and its dangers.
Wait here.
Is that why you came through the portal?
Because you thought I was helpless here?
No.
I came through to be with you.
Lancelot?
Snow.
If I'd have known that you were the prisoners mulan had brought back,
I never would've locked you away.
Please forgive me.
Of course.
Lancelot? Really?
He's an old friend.
We can trust him.
This is Emma.
Why is he embracing them?
They were responsible for Phillip's death.
You're new here, Aurora.
Phillip trusted Lancelot. So must we.
I want justice.
Tread carefully.
It's dangerous to confuse vengeance with justice.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
Yes.
What the hell is that?
That is Chimera.
An acquired taste, but all our hunting party could bring back.
One part lion, one part serpent,
one part goat.
Like turducken?
I don't understand.
We were told this land didn't even exist anymore.
How did you all escape the curse?
It is a mystery.
The curse struck, and when the smoke cleared,
most of us had been torn from this land.
But some of us here, in this particular region,
were left behind.
We don't know how and we don't know why.
Finding this safe haven wasn't easy.
It took some spilt blood.
But worry not.
You're safe here.
We can't stay.
My husband's back there, Emma's son,
my grandson-- we have to get back to them.
Can you help us find a portal?
Leaving is unwise.
The enchanted forest is not as you remember it.
The ogres have returned.
Ogres?
Like as in Fee-fi-fo-fum?
Those would be giants.
Ogres are far worse.
That's why we live here,
on this island, where it's safe.
Please, Snow.
Stay here. There are no more portals left.
I might know of one.
You do?
Where?
Cora's near.
I don't feel comfortable voicing my plans.
She's powerful.
Not anymore.
The curse stripped her of her powers.
But given her reputation,
we've kept her locked up as a precaution.
Nevertheless, I'm not taking chances.
Just trust me. I may have a way.
Let us go.
I'll allow it,
but on one condition...
take my bravest warrior with you.
Allow Mulan to defend you.
We can defend ourselves.
Deal.
Thank you, Lancelot,
for always looking out for me.
I don't care what you do to me.
I will never tell you where he is!
I know. That's not why you're here.
Would you bring our guest some water?
Times have been good for you, haven't they?
I can see a light in your eyes.
Cherish that,
because that light can die
and be replaced by something else...
Pain.
The only thing you know of pain is how to inflict it.
That's where you're so very, very wrong.
I've had my share of pain.
I had a son that I loved die before his time.
I tried to replace him with your "Charming,"
offered him the world,
but he rejected me,
humiliated me in front of my kingdom,
all for the sake of true love.
Something about which you know nothing.
I know more than you think.
You...
were in love?
Yes,
and she loved me.
We were happy, blissful,
but then she became cursed.
She drank a vile potion
that made it impossible for us to conceive a child.
Family is everything, my dear.
Losing all hope of having one--
there is no greater misery.
Charming could've been that hope for me,
but instead, he made my suffering worse.
For that, death is too good for him.
First, he must know pain-- my pain.
No.
You poisoned her?
I cursed her.
She will never bear a child.
Choose wisely.
We must be vigilant if we hope to survive the journey.
Where's my gun?
I want it back.
Is it magic?
Depends on who's pulling the trigger.
Follow my lead, step where I step,
do exactly as I say, and we might survive.
Thanks for the pep talk, but I think we're okay.
I just killed a dragon last week.
Have you ever seen an ogre?
Pretty sure I've dated a few.
Legend has it that when they kill you,
the last thing you see
is yourself dying in the reflection in their eyes.
Let's walk.
It'll be dark soon.
Don't let her rattle you.
I won't let anything happen to us.
Stick to the plan.
What is the plan? You haven't told me anything.
What's going on?
The wardrobe.
Wardrobe?
The wardrobe?
Like, the wardrobe that sent little baby me to Maine?
You think it could get us back to Storybrooke?
I don't know.
First we have to see if it survived the curse,
then we'll worry about making it work.
Where is it?
My place.
You wanna see where you're from, Emma?
That's right.
We're going home.
Jefferson.
Right?
The mad hatter.
I need your help.
Look, I already told your grandfather--
I can't do anything.
I know, but there must be something we can do.
I'm the wrong person to talk to, kid.
Magic's not my thing. Try your mother.
Maybe she's got something in that vault of hers
she can help you with.
Vault?
Her vault is here? In Storybrooke?
It's none of my business. Talk to her.
What's that?
Your daughter's looking for you, isn't she?
What do you know about it?
I've read your story.
I know how the two of you were separated.
Why are you here?
She's at school.
I gotta go home, kid.
She probably wants to see you.
Get out of my way.
Why aren't you going to find her?
Get out of my way.
Because I left her!
And she'll hate me.
How do you know that?
I was on my way,
but fate reminded me I shouldn't.
You should.
I've been left, too.
Anything's better than nothing.
She'll spend her whole life wondering why you left her.
Not knowing is the worst.
Henry.
I'm just packing up the office.
I've been asked to leave.
No, of course it can wait.
I'd love to have lunch with you.
Granny's, ten minutes.
This will do.
We'll make camp here for the night.
We just need to find water, collect some firewood.
Uh, if we're hiding from ogres,
shouldn't we maybe, I don't know, not start a fire?
Ogres are blind. They hunt by sound alone.
Right. Because that's something everyone would know about ogres.
Look...
I know you're out of your element...
I'm fine.
I know, but maybe you should just stay here
while we get wood and water, guard the campsite.
You mean the big, empty clearing?
It's the safest place. We'll be right back.
Wait! I've come to help.
After what you did to me?
After what the king did to you.
I still do have a small shred of honor left.
Do you really think I'm that naive?
You're going to earn my trust so I can lead you straight--
To the cabin where your prince is hiding his mother?
How did you know?
Because George knows where it is.
He sent men there to kill your man's mother.
Charming's at the cabin, too.
Mother, the place looks beautiful.
Will you come inside?
I'm sorry if I want things to be perfect
when I meet the girl my son is going to marry.
Wait.
Did you hear that?
Go in. Bolt the door.
Whatever happens, stay inside. Go.
What?
That's it?
Son?
Mother!
Mother!
I told you to stay inside.
I know, but I heard you.
I thought you were hurt.
I'm sorry.
No. You're gonna be okay.
Okay? Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm so sorry.
We came as quickly as we could.
Is this...
Snow?
Don't move.
Phillip's gone because of you.
You listen to me, princess!
You think I don't know what it's like
to be separated from the people that I love?
What happened to Phillip was not our fault.
So I suggest you find another way to channel your anger.
Don't talk to her like that.
She tried to kill me.
I will deal with her.
Emma, what are you doing?
Protecting you. Drop the weapon!
Do you have any idea what you've just done?
Ogres?
Run!
Aurora. This way.
Come on!
Split up!
Come on!
Over there.
Seriously?
Back away from my daughter!
You have to shoot them in the eye.
When was the last time you shot an arrow?
28 years ago.
Guess it's like riding a bike.
Yeah, but how did you know you could hit that?
I didn't.
Next time, listen to me.
That kind of thing isn't gonna work here.
Yeah.
We should get going.
It's poisoned.
Can we find an antidote?
Or the fairies. They can help us.
No. I'm afraid this is gonna take
something stronger than fairy dust.
Lake nostos-- I've been there before.
Its waters have powerful magical properties.
I've seen them turn a man from solid gold back into flesh.
It isn't far. A day's journey at most.
I'll prepare a wagon.
Must be a curious tale.
What?
Well, how a knight of the round table ended up a sword for hire.
You mean how did I fall from grace?
The same way you ended up running from king George.
A woman.
We're gonna scout ahead. We won't be long.
Thank you.
Oh. It's the least I can do. Are you comfortable?
No.
For giving my son something to believe in.
All he's ever dreamt of was having a wife
and a son.
Fret not.
It could be a daughter. But trust me,
all that matters is that it's healthy.
Let me show you something.
My mother gave this to me
when I was pregnant.
She said it was spelled by a gypsy
to predict the sex of your firstborn
even before you are with child.
And it works?
It did with my boys.
If it swings north to south,
it's a boy.
East to west, it's a girl.
Shall we?
Just between us?
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.
Indulge an old woman.
It'll help take my mind off the...
Well, you know.
Here.
Don't worry. It's just...
a silly superstition.
What's wrong, child?
You can tell me anything, snow.
It's the king.
When he captured me, he cursed me,
so...
So that I can never have children.
Worry not.
If the water from lake Nostos can heal me,
it should be able to do the same for you.
Do you really think so?
You are going to be a wonderful mother.
We're getting close.
Aurora, you've gotta keep up.
Sorry, but I'm not exactly dressed for the woods.
It's cold out here.
Then maybe you should've listened to me and stayed back.
Here.
But I tried to kill your friend.
Actually, she's my mom.
I have a feeling she can take care of herself.
And I get it.
You're not the only one who's been screwing up lately.
What kind of corset is this?
Up here!
Is that it?
Yeah.
That's our home.
Where's the lake?
We're looking at it.
It's gone.
Maybe we should've gone with operation viper.
You all right?
Yeah.
How'd you know I was down here?
Your mom said you asked her to lunch,
and when you stood her up, she checked her office,
saw her keys missing, figured out the rest.
She would've come herself,
but she didn't think you'd go with her.
Henry, what were you thinking?
I just want them back.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
I should be over there with them,
riding horses, learning how to swordfight.
I know. I know.
It's okay,
because we are gonna do this together.
Come on now.
You gotta get to school...
and I gotta make sure no one else finds this place.
This is my fault.
The siren who lived here-- I killed her.
That's why the lake is dry.
You needn't worry. My mother raised me by a lake.
There may yet be water.
You just... need to know where to look.
God in his mercy,
lend her grace.
You found it?
It's all that's left.
Just enough for one sip.
Enough to heal my mother.
We shall find out.
I want you to have it. That last sip of water--
I want you to drink it.
No. No, I couldn't.
That water can lift your curse,
allow you and my son
to have a child.
But you'll die.
I won't let you give your life for this.
That's what parents do.
They put their children first.
Someday you will understand.
No.
Maybe it's for the best.
I was raised without a mother.
I wouldn't even know how to be one.
This water was meant for you.
Mother.
Mother.
Our prayers are answered.
There is magic in this lake yet. Here. Drink.
Have faith, Snow.
We'll find another way.
Oh, my god.
I recognize this from Henry's book.
Come.
We'll stand watch at the gate.
I never thought I'd see this place again.
This room.
It was your nursery.
I lived here?
You never even got to spend a night.
This is the life I wanted you to have.
I was going to teach you how to walk in here,
how to talk,
how to dress for your first ball.
You never got to do any of it.
We never got to be a family.
We have a family-- in Storybrooke.
And right now they need us to get back there.
So...
how do we get this to work?
Why isn't it working?
Wounds take time to heal.
No. No.
I used this magic before. It worked instantly.
There wasn't enough water. We need more.
Son...
stop.
There's no m-more magic here,
and I don't want to spend my last moments this way.
This is all my fault.
I am so sorry.
F-for what?
For being happy?
For finding your true love?
For your happiness,
I would gladly give my life.
My only regret is that
I won't live to see you marry Snow.
Yes, you will.
Lancelot,
does a disgraced member of the round table
still have the power to perform a wedding?
It would be my honor.
In my kingdom,
there is legend of a cup
that has the power to grant eternal life.
And so may the love between you always be strong,
true, and eternal.
Good-bye, mother.
Where's the "On" Switch?
It's more complicated than that.
We'll have to get it back to the island.
Hopefully, someone there has access to enough magic
to make it work again.
How are we gonna carry this thing?
With the help of an old friend.
Lancelot.
What are you doing here?
We heard about the ogre attack,
and I had to make sure you were all right.
Oh. Where are Mulan and Aurora?
I sent them to find food. Tonight we'll make camp,
and in the morning, we'll head back.
So... this is it--
the portal you were after.
The same one Emma went through.
It's how she escaped the curse.
Remarkable.
Geppetto carved it from an enchanted tree, but...
there's no magic left.
A portal this powerful...
there must be another way to recharge it.
Why are you so interested in the wardrobe?
Well, I just want you to get home to your husband
and son.
Henry.
They must miss you.
Stay away from him, Emma.
He is not who he says he is.
What are you talking about? Who the hell is he?
There is only one person you told Henry's name.
Cora.
Clever girl.
Where's Lancelot?
He's dead. I killed him a long time ago.
And you've been posing as him ever since.
Well, they'd never listen to me.
And besides, every kingdom needs a hero, don't you think?
Thank you, Snow.
I've been looking for a way over for so long.
I never thought the person to help me find it...
would be you.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
I want to see my daughter.
It's been too long.
And you know, I would love to meet my grandson Henry.
No, you won't!
No!
Mulan!
We're not done.
You okay?
You saved me.
Yeah, well... where is she?
Gone.
So's our ride home.
I'm so sorry.
She was all the family you had left.
No.
I still have you.
I love you, Snow.
And together, we can start a new family.
Here. This belonged to her.
She would've wanted you to have it.
She said that it could tell you what your child would be.
Please don't.
It's just a superstition.
There's something I need to tell you.
What is it?
What's wrong?
We're going to have a child.
What?
We're going to have a child.
Is there something I need to know?
I mean someday.
Well, of course we are.
What's it say it's gonna be?
It's gonna be a boy, right?
I can never remember which direction means what.
It's a surprise.
I'll send the signal for the army to regroup.
We are gonna take back the kingdom, Snow,
and we are going to do it as a family.
This is because of you, isn't it?
Ruth only pretended to drink the water.
She had you put it in the wedding chalice
so I would drink it.
That's how king George's curse was broken, wasn't it?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
So...
What's your child gonna be?
A girl.
Lancelot was one of the most noble knights I ever knew.
How could I be so blind?
How could I not see that it was Cora?
Well, to be fair,
the whole shape-shifting thing threw me, too.
What are we going to tell the people on the island?
The truth--that Lancelot was cut down by a terrible villain.
He died an honorable death.
Cora's still out there. We need to find her.
We need to defend what's left of the kingdom.
Who's going to lead us? You?
No.
Her.
I'm honored,
but Emma and I still have to find a way back to Storybrooke.
We'll help you.
We'll find a way, won't we?
Yes.
Perhaps it'll help me channel my anger.
Come.
I'm, uh...
Sorry I torched our ride home.
I couldn't let her get to Henry.
I just--
You had to put Henry first.
I was angry for so long...
wondering how you could choose
to let me grow up without you.
But then just seeing all this...
you gave up everything for me
and you're still doing that.
Sorry. I'm not good at this. I...
I guess I just...
I'm not used to someone putting me first.
Well, get used to it.
Grace.
Papa!
You found me. I knew you would.
I've been thinking,
if you're gonna start helping me,
we gotta make sure we do this right.
So I picked these up
on my way home.
Seriously?
Yeah, you're the grandson of a prince.
I think it's about time you learned how to use a sword.
Henry, I can't get 'em back without you.
So?
What do you say? You with me?
Can you teach me how to fight a dragon?
We'll work our way up to it.
My liege.
En garde.
Hey. Come over here.
Up top.
