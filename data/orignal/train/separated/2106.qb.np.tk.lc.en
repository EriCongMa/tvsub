hey , guys , come in here .
come on here , listen up .
our target &apos;s name is wo fat .
thermal imaging shows one heat signature
in the safehouse , so we know he &apos;s one .
do not let that fool you . this guy is a major arms dealer ,
with known terrorist affiliations
and over a dozen kills to his name .
he &apos;s more than likely carrng a weapon ,
and he &apos;s most definitely dangerous .
so stay focused .
be aware of your surroundings at all times , all right ? let &apos;s go .
gearing up , huh ?
yeah .
good for you . you forgot one thing , though .
what are you doing ? what are you doing with those ? !
you &apos;re not a field agent , okay ?
you &apos;re an analyst .
are you kidding me ?
it is my intel that got us here .
i cannot believe you &apos;re going to freeze me out now .
look , i understand how much this means to you .
but you &apos;re not going to get hurt on my watch , okay ?
let &apos;s go , guys ! let &apos;s go , move out .
steve , you all right ? !
break contact !
barricade ! guns stop fired !
copy that .
entry team , fall back !
boss , he &apos;s on the move !
i &apos;m going in ! stay here . surround the perimeter .
i &apos;m have him heading toward the back of the house .
boss , he &apos;s moving upstairs !
i got eyes on the target , but it &apos;s not wo fat .
it &apos;s sang min .
i &apos;ll repeat : it &apos;s sang min .
please repeat .
i say again : sang min .
wo fat wasn &apos;t in the house .
kaye , get down !
you all right ?
yeah .
stay here . please . okay ?
hi , i got him .
he just went into a house
three doors down from the safe house .
all right ... he &apos;in a white cadillac sedan .
plate number : charlie @-@ tango 832 romeo .
call it in , kono . every agency .
listen to me ...
sang min knows that we &apos;re onto him .
he &apos;s going to try to flee the island .
yeah .
correct if i &apos;m wrong ,
but wasn &apos;t there a car attached to you ?
oh , weird .
all right , apb is out .
okay , who is sang min ?
fugitive ,
human trafficker , all @-@ around scumbag .
he &apos;s also a known associate of victor hesse ,
which puts him in the same circles as wo fat .
okay , so he could &apos;ve been holding up
at wo fat &apos;s safe house .
or he was taking a shot at him .
the front door was rigged with the explosive charge , right ?
i think sang min was expecting
wo fat to be walking through that door .
why @-@ why would he try to kill him ?
i think it was a preemptive strike .
sang min knows that wo fat doesn &apos;t like loose ends .
which exactly what he became once he escaped from prison .
danny !
danny ! danny !
danny , you hit ?
no . but something &apos;s not right . i can &apos;t breathe .
guys , his pulse is slow .
okay , i &apos;m going to call an ambulance .
my chest , i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t breathe .
all right , we got help on the way , okay ?
just tell me what happened ?
uh , there &apos;s a body . no pulse .
this is officer kalakaua . i need an ambulance at ...
stay with him .
1408 palo avenue . yeah .
stop ! stop right there !
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
but whatever he died from , it might be biological .
you have to get danny to a hospital right now .
steve ! over here .
hang in there , hang in there .
he &apos;s starting to convulse !
danny ! danny ! hey , stay with me , danny ! stay with me !
bp &apos;s 72 over 40 . breathing slow and shallow .
how long since his last exposure ?
uh , 20 , 30 minutes .
do we know what kind of toxin we &apos;re dealing with ?
i don &apos;t know . my team &apos;s still working on it .
you better hurry , because i don &apos;t know how much time he has .
i need to get mcgarrett on the phone .
all right , so ... what are we looking at here .
victim inside died from exposure to a chemical weapon ;
a nerve agent , to be exact .
how can you be sure ?
i spent two years
with the cia &apos;s biological threat assessment team .
one of our case studies was the subway attack - in &apos; 95 ...
right , right , right . terrorists released sarin
on multiple trains . whole subway system was affected .
and our victim inside has the same symptoms :
facial ulcerations ,
petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes , constricted pupils--
everything is localized around the head ,
which makes me believe that he ingested the toxin orally .
so someone spiked the milk that our victim drank .
sarin is also transdermal ,
which means that danny was exposed
when he touched the victim to check for a pulse .
mcgarrett .
hey , it &apos;s kaye . listen to me .
danny has been exposed to sarin .
you need to tell the doctors to get him on pralidoxime right away .
if they don &apos;t ... he &apos;s going to die .
hey , how &apos;s danny ?
he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s responding to the drugs . i mean , it &apos;s still early ,
but , uh , they all seem to think he &apos;s going to pull through , so ...
all right . thank god .
yeah .
you were right about the sarin .
if they didn &apos;t found out when they did ,
danny would probably be dead right now .
does he have a family ?
yeah , he &apos;s got an ex @-@ wife and a little girl .
danny said something about hang grace this weekend .
ah , rachel and stan are in maui .
hey , can we see him ?
not right now . the doctor said once he &apos;s stable
they &apos;re going to move him to a recovery ward
where he can have some visitors .
look , guys , i know this is hard , and we all want be here .
but , we need to i.d. this victim ,
and need to find out where he bought that milk .
right . do you think this could be an act of terrorism ?
or a random act of mayhem , like the tylenol scare in the &apos; 80s .
either way , we need to make sure
there &apos;s no further risk , okay .
so , you two , i need you to contact the milk distributor ,
find out where they sell their product ,
and pull everything off the shelves .
i don &apos;t care if we &apos;re even taking resources
away from finding sang min .
right now , this is our number one priority .
we &apos;re on it .
kaye , can you coordinate with cdc ?
gotta make sure nothing else is contaminated .
yeah , of course . i can also send a sample
to a contact at langley .
he can run chemical analysis ,
maybe determine te source of the sarin
hey ... thanks jenna .
oh , please . you &apos;re in crisis mode ,
you &apos;re down a man , i &apos;m more than happy to pitch in .
besides , i don &apos;t even really know if there &apos;s a job
waiting for me back home .
took three months leave of absence
to hunt down the man who killed my fiance ,
and the last time i checked the cia wasn &apos;t ...
super @-@ keen on the whole , you know , personal vendetta thing .
so if you think at i can help you with your investigation .
kaye . kaye . kaye ! kaye !
yeah .
well , what i meant to say was
&quot; thank you for helping danny . &quot; okay ?
you saved his life .
you &apos;re welcome .
call me if you get something .
okay .
where are you going ?
i got a little something to take care of .
mcgarrett .
you should have seen your face .
bet i was the last person you expected to see , huh ?
have to say i was pretty surprised myself .
i &apos;m guessing that bomb on the door was intended for wo fat .
doesn &apos;t matter now , does it ?
we both missed our shot .
but i might be able to give you a second chance .
what &apos;s it worth if i help you find him ?
what &apos;s it worth ? not much , okay ?
considering you &apos;ve already burned us once .
well , the situation has changed .
all right , you want to make a deal ? great .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m prepared to offer you .
hi , gracie !
uncle steve !
hey .
hi , kiddo .
where &apos;s daddy ?
listen , gracie ,
danno &apos;s , uh , danno &apos;s not feeling the best , okay ?
so i &apos;m going to take you to the hospital . we &apos;re going to go see him .
is he going to be okay ?
is he going to be okay ?
let me tell you something about your father .
he might not talk like it ,
but he is one tough guy , and he &apos;s brave , as well .
can you be brave like danno ?
are you sure ? then we should go see him .
what are you waiting for ? come on .
pae &apos;aina dairy products sell at over a hundred locations on the island .
we pulled all of their milk cartons off the shelves .
cdc is doing some random testing ,
but so far none of the samples have turned up positive
for sarin , except for the one that our victim drank from .
so it &apos;s looking like an isolated incident .
now the question is , was it random
or was our victim targeted ?
sarin seems like an odd choice for a murder weapon .
it &apos;s actually not as far @-@ fetched
as you might think .
used to be that sarin was hard to get ,
but ever since 9 / 11
we &apos;ve taken down so many terror cells
that sarin brokers are looking for new customers .
basically , anyone with cash and connections to the black market
can get their hands on it .
hey , got an i.d. on our vic .
guy &apos;s name is amoka mulitalo , 57 years old .
was arrest six months ago for misdemeanor trespassing .
which is interesting , coidering the house
we found him in wasn &apos;t his own .
well , whose house is it ?
jeff and sheila fallon .
pay taxes in california , but keep this home as a vacation rental .
so , what &apos;s amoka doing in their house
drinking tainted milk ?
my father was never the same after his auto accident .
he suffered from aphasia , impaired memory .
he just couldn &apos;t manage for himself .
so ... we had him move in with us .
you filed a missing persons report for your father a few weeks ago .
that wasn &apos;t the first time , either , was it ?
sometimes ...
he &apos;ll go for a walk , forget how to get home .
if i couldn &apos;t find him , i &apos;ll file a missing persons report .
then , a few days later ,
the police will find him on the street or ...
at a shelter .
but this time ...
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
we &apos;ve never seen him before .
i don &apos;t understand . how did this man
end up dead in our house ?
we believe he was squatting there ,
and when he was in your home , he drank some milk om the refrigerator .
that milk was laced with sarin--
it &apos;s a compound that &apos;s used as a chemical weapon .
it killed him within minutes .
what is it ?
we were supposed to come to hawaii last week .
i asked our caretaker , gabriel ,
to stock the refrigerator .
but we ended up canceling the trip .
so gabriel &apos;s the one who bought the milk ?
yes .
when was the last time you spoke to him ?
a few days ago , when we let him go .
you fired him ? why ?
we had given him a checkbook to cover expenses .
bills , repairs and such .
last week , we found he had been writing checks to himself .
i called him . he denied it at first ,
but ... eventually , he came clean .
i told him to keep the money and leave us his key .
how did he take that ?
not well . he was very upset .
you think the caretaker planted the sarin ?
well , the man has a history of violence .
he served time for aggravated assault
in several home @-@ invasion robberies ,
plus he was just fired , which does give him motive .
but it doesn &apos;t give him means ,
sarin &apos;s not exactly easy to find .
i mean , how does a local caretaker
get his hands on it ?
right . i &apos;m still running background .
but chin and kono are on their way
to ask him that very question .
okay , i got to go , okay ? just keep me posted .
yeah , sure thing .
hey , doc , how &apos;s he going ?
ready for some visitors .
all right .
gracie , let &apos;s go see danno .
looks like he &apos;s sleeping .
danno !
monkey !
i made this for you .
you did ?
look at this . this is me .
see , this is a masterpiece . look at that .
i mean , she &apos;s an artist , no ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
so i &apos;m gonna make a nice space on the refrigerator
and move some stuff around .
this is going dead center .
thank you .
how you feeling ?
i don &apos;t know , i feel like everything hurts .
head feels like it &apos;s gonna explode .
it &apos;s like the worst hangover i ever had .
what &apos;s a hangover ?
it &apos;s , uh , you &apos;ll figure it out , you &apos;ll learn about it
one day when you &apos;re about , what , 35 ?
35 , 30 ... 16 .
40 years old .
thank you .
don &apos;t mention it .
listen , since you &apos;re , uh , since you &apos;re looking so ...
so good now ,
i &apos;m gonna head back to the office , okay ?
i &apos;ll swing by and pick her up later .
she can stay with me until , uh , until rachel gets back .
how does that sound ?
what do you think ?
okay .
you okay ?
i got everything i need right here .
i &apos;m good .
hey .
you kidnap miley cyrus and put her in your backpack ,
or is that a cell phone ?
stan bought it for me .
he did ?
fabulous . go answer it .
first boy that calls , i &apos;m gonna whip that thing
into the pacific ocean , okay ?
hi , mommy .
yeah , i &apos;m with daddy .
he &apos;s in the hospital .
mommy wants to talk to you .
hi , rachel .
no , i &apos;m fine .
would you please stop ?
i said i &apos;m fine .
i like hospital food ; you know that .
i checked in for the weekend ; i like it here , it &apos;s nice .
oh , yeah .
this place , they make a kick @-@ ass loco moco .
yeah ? too bad we won &apos;t be staying for lunch .
gabriel delgado ?
i &apos;m going out the front !
five @-@ o ! stay down and don &apos;t move .
look , i told you ,
my son ... he &apos;s sick .
he &apos;s got leukemia .
first five years of his life , i &apos;m locked up .
i finally get out of prison ,
i can &apos;t even pay his hospital bill .
what kind of father does that make me ?
so is that why you stole from the fallons ?
i got another job driving the airport shuttle .
i was gonna put the money back in their account as soon as i got paid .
but they found out before you could , right ?
and you knew if they reported the crime ,
it was back to prison for you .
that &apos;s why you tried to kill them .
what ?
did you buy groceries for the fallons last week ?
i did .
well , we found sarini nside a milk carton
that you put in their fridge .
why don &apos;t you tell us about that ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
i don &apos;t even know what ... sarin is .
oh , really ? let me show you .
this is sarin .
and that &apos;s what sarin does to you .
oh , my god .
amoka .
what , you know him ?
yeah .
yeah , i @-@ i take my boy to blessed people &apos;s mission .
they have a free clinic once a week .
amoka sometimes sleeps at their shelter .
kind man .
even with all his own problems ,
he would always ask about my son .
i knew he was having a hard time there ,
so i told him about the rock .
what rock ?
so , the fallons hid a spare key at their property .
we found it in the backyard ,
and gabriel admitted to telling amoka about it .
said that he stayed there for a few nights
when the shelter got overcrowded .
and we believe him ?
i spoke to the mission ; story checks out .
apparently , amoka stayed at the shelter
off and on for two months .
same dates as gabriel &apos;s son was getting treatment .
if gabriel planted sarin in the milk ,
the last thing he &apos;s gonna want to do is let a hungry homeless guy
come and stay at the house before the targets return .
so we just lost our only suspect .
the good news is we may have picked up a new one .
i pulled a fresh print off the spare key .
it belongs to elliot connor--
his fingerprints are on file with the sec .
how does he know jeff and sheila fallon ?
well , in addition to being jeff &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law ,
he &apos;s also an employee .
he &apos;s the coo of jeff &apos;s company .
they do big business manufacturing industrial storage equipment .
check this out .
according to &quot; international business news , &quot;
there have been rumors about friction between jeff and elliot .
apparently some of the board meetings have gotten contentious .
sounds like motive .
all right . you guys go talk to jeff ,
see what he &apos;s got to say about it ,
you and i &apos;ll go see elliot .
look , i already gave you my statement .
well , if you want to bring me in again ,
you know where to find me .
i may as well tell you , &apos; cause you &apos;re gonna find out .
i returned the money to i.a.
it was the only way to keep uncle keako out of prison .
where did you even come up with 200,000 dollars ?
got a loan from somebody . borrowed against the house .
this is crazy .
all i.a. has to do is run the serial numbers ,
and they &apos;ll know they won &apos;t match the ones that were stolen .
actually , they can &apos;t do that .
inventory logs for the asset forfeiture locker
went missing years ago .
how do you know that ?
everybody in the department knows it .
it &apos;s the worst @-@ kept secret on the island .
i never heard about it .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you never walked a beat .
somewhere , right now , there are two cops
telling this story over coffee and malasadas .
cuz ...
you &apos;ve been carrying this for a long time .
you took the blame for a crime you didn &apos;t commit ,
and you lost your job ...
your friends ...
and your family .
and now you have a chance to get out from under all this .
and what ?
you &apos;re gonna throw it all away ,
put yourself into debt ,
and go to prison ?
excuse me .
we &apos;d like to see elliot connor .
sorry , he &apos;s in a meeting now .
see if you can free him up for us .
rumors of a rift between me and jeff are nonsense .
have there been disagreements ?
of course , but that &apos;s normal
when you &apos;re managing a business with someone .
well , just out of curiosity ,
mr. connor , what were your disagreements about ?
jeff relocated me to hawaii
to run the pacific base of operations .
the company &apos;s planning a big push into asia .
we had some differences of opinion on marketing strategy .
that &apos;s it .
one of the advantages of working with my brother @-@ in @-@ law
is that we can slug it out at the office ,
but at the end of the day , it &apos;s family first .
work always comes second .
sounds like you &apos;re close .
that &apos;s nice .
so , uh , tell me something .
jeff and sheila-- do they ever have
you come by the house , check on the property ?
no , they have a caretaker who stays there when they &apos;re away .
all right , then , why did we find your fingerprint
on the spare key that was hidden outside the house ?
you know , i did use that key once
to drop off some papers--
the q4 financial report .
i wanted jeff to review it as soon as he arrived .
please don &apos;t lie to us .
i &apos;m not .
you shifted in your chair and you touched your face
as you were answering the question .
those are both signs of deception .
plus , you added unnecessary details
about delivering the papers
just to make your lie sound more credible .
does jeff know that you &apos;re using
his house to cheat on his sister ?
what ?
that &apos;s absurd .
wow , mock outrage-- that &apos;s a bad one .
tan line on your finger there .
forget to put your wedding band back on
after zour last hookup ?
look ,
here &apos;s what i think &apos;s going on , okay ?
either
you &apos;ve been using jeff &apos;s house to carry on an affair
and that &apos;s why we found your print on the key ,
or you were in the house trying to kill your partner .
which is it ?
we haven &apos;t used the house in months ...
... not since jeff confronted me about it ,
and that &apos;s the real reason things
have been tense here at work . it has nothing to do with business .
well , with all due respect ,
elliott , you were using his house to cheat on his sister .
i can hardly blame him for being upset .
i know it &apos;s terrible .
jeff asked me to break it off with chloe , and i &apos;m going to .
just haven &apos;t gotten around to it yet ?
we &apos;re going to need to talk to chloe , okay ,
to corroborate this .
go ahead .
she &apos;s right outside .
the secretary ?
that &apos;s original .
can i ask you a question ?
so , what do you need a slingshot for ?
doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
i mean , they &apos;re birds .
can &apos;t they fly ?
these birds don &apos;t have wings .
oh , that explains it .
now i know why they &apos;re so angry .
thank you for clarifying .
howzit , jersey ?
hey , big dog , what &apos;s going on ?
grace , you remember kamekona .
hi . what up , shorty ?
figured you guys need some grub .
i know hospital foods are the worst and the portions--
very small .
that &apos;s very sweet of you .
fried chicken ?
filipino @-@ style .
best on the island , brah .
you know , grace ,
when i was a little keiki like you ,
my mama used to bring me this chicken every time i was sick .
fried chicken isn &apos;t good for you .
it has cholesterol and causes heart disease .
nah , a little bit of grease is good for you .
helps the insides stay lubricated .
drumstick or thigh ?
um , i &apos;m gonna go-- i like white meat .
is the a breast ?
sorry , all gone .
that was a long drive , brah .
i know , i know .
well , i didn &apos;t call you here for the chicken .
grace , put your headphones on , please .
so ... your boy sang min has resurfaced .
heard he bounced a few months ago .
he &apos;s back ?
in a big way .
looks like he took a swing at some heavy hitters
and he missed .
my guess is he &apos;s looking for a way off the island ,
so i need you
to get on the coconut wireless , make a couple calls .
you found him for us once ,
you can do it again , right ?
sure , let me use your phone .
what &apos;s wrong with your phone ?
i don &apos;t bring &apos; em to the hospitals no more , brah .
you heard about the signals interfering with the pacemakers ?
it &apos;s true .
okay , you can use my phone .
will you wipe your greasy paws off
before you touch my phone , though ?
what grease ?
yeah , they look like ...
that &apos;s sufficient .
you got something ?
yeah , i got a call from your cia contact .
they found a chemical match to our sarin .
turns out it &apos;s the same strand
used by a chechen terror group
in a botched moscow attack five years ago ,
and the russian fsb
identified the supplier as mikhail yursky ,
and get this--
mr. yursky arrived
in hawaii five days ago under a fake passport .
time line matches the murder .
then that &apos;s our killer .
now all we have to do is find him .
clear . you &apos;re all secure .
hey , mikhail &apos;s not here .
what do you got ?
we found a credit card under the same name
as his fake passport .
he just purchased a flight to borneo .
leaves tonight at 7 : 00 .
all right , notify the tsa .
we &apos;ll have the sheriff &apos;s department cover the flight
and we &apos;ll leave a unit here at the hotel in case he comes back .
whoa , whoa , whoa , hey , i just got a fresh hit .
his card &apos;s being used at an atm
right now-- central pacific bank on alakawa .
that &apos;s a couple blocks away . we &apos;re on the way .
okay , i &apos;ll see if i can stall him for you .
now you might want to try checking the magnetic strip .
maybe clean it .
oh , you &apos;re good .
not good , not good .
steve , he &apos;s on the move .
got him-- right there .
got him .
all units , be advised .
suspect is in a maroon sedan
traveling north on alakawa .
stand back , the canister has a leak .
he &apos;s been exposed .
i &apos;ll call for an ambulance ,
get hpd hazmat as well .
go , go .
this is kelly , five @-@ o ...
yeah , we &apos;re at an alleyway behind the 1500 block
of alakawa .
chin , he &apos;s done , he &apos;s dead .
uh , chuck the ambulance .
send the m.e. and the hazmat team .
okay , all right .
hey .
what the hell ?
are we ready for that extra credit ?
extra credit ?
you &apos;re telling me that this guy
is not from around here ?
no , dad , sponge bob lives in a pineapple under the sea .
well , what else could be more hawaiian than that ?
mommy .
daddy &apos;s not sick anymore .
i am so happy to see that .
you didn &apos;t have to come .
yes , i did .
all right , well , once it &apos;s deemed safe ,
have hpd process the car for evidence .
hazmat team just finished checking
the canisters in mikhail &apos;s trunk--
empty with no signs of toxins .
well , he was about to leave the island with them .
i &apos;m guessing he was going to use the canisters
to traffic the sarin .
yeah , what &apos;s still not adding up , though ,
is why a bioweapons dealer with terrorist ties
would target two innocent people from the mainland .
what &apos;s going on ?
commander mcgarrett .
david akahoshi , internal affairs .
i know who you are .
what are you doing here ?
i came to return something to mr. kelly .
the serial numbers on these bills
don &apos;t match the stolen money ,
which means you &apos;re trying
to cover for your uncle .
those inventory logs disappeared years ago ,
so those serial numbers don &apos;t exist .
actually , they do .
after the forfeiture locker was robbed ,
i.a. kept waiting for you to slip up
and spend the money somewhere .
we figured that you were being careful ,
so we had the asset forfeiture division put the word out
that their inventory records had been lost .
it was all a lie .
if you thought we couldn &apos;t trace the serial numbers ,
maybe you would finally start spending the money ,
but that never happened
because you never stole it .
chin ,
this has gone too far .
you got your money back .
let this go .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t do that .
i know you were just trying to protect your family ,
which is why i am not going to charge you with obstruction of justice .
i &apos;m not even going to ask where you got that money ,
but your uncle stole from the honolulu police department ,
which means he stole from the people of hawaii ,
and he &apos;s going to have to answer for that .
i myself am going to ask where you got this money .
marcum .
the bookie ?
i signed the deed to my house over to him .
return it . get your deed back .
steve ...
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
listen to me , all right ?
if you did this for your uncle ,
you don &apos;t have to explain anything else to me .
you guys need to see this .
so , any respectable chemist can synthesize sarin ;
the trick is not killing yourself in the process .
because in addition to having a short half @-@ life ,
sarin &apos;s also extremely volatile ,
making storage a challenge .
the ideal container is
electro @-@ polished aluminum ,
double @-@ walled with a fail @-@ safe coupling valve--
but those can be difficult to procure .
that &apos;s right , because the fbi monitors
large sales of these things to make sure that
they &apos;re not being used to traffic chemical weapons .
exactly . which is why it &apos;s so impressive that we found
36 of these canisters in mikhail &apos;s trunk .
check out who the manufacturer is .
fallon global ? that &apos;s jeff and elliot &apos;s company .
so mikhail ends up getting his canisters from them ,
and his sarin ends up at jeff &apos;s house .
that &apos;s not all-- i pulled mikhail &apos;s phone records .
guess who he called the day he landed ?
mr. connor .
have you got a minute ?
i &apos;ve never seen this man before in my life .
that &apos;s funny , &apos; cause he called here the other day .
three times .
i didn &apos;t speak with him .
oh , yeah ? phone records show the calls came into your direct line ,
and you spoke for a total of 12 minutes .
we think we might know what you were talking about , too .
you see , mikhail , he wanted equipment
that your company produces so he could store his sarin .
you wanted your brother @-@ in @-@ law out of the picture
so you could run the company .
what &apos;s it called ?
quid pro quo ?
no . i was thinking of something else .
oh , yeah . conspiracy to solicit murder .
these calls , when did they happen ?
thursday , the 13th .
i was on the big island last week .
i didn &apos;t get back until saturday .
you can check with the hotel .
well , then who took the calls ?
only person who answers my calls is my secretary .
she &apos;s gone .
suspect &apos;s name is chloe ballantine .
i need you to lock down the entire building right away .
right now .
steve !
put your hands on the wheel .
put your hands on the wheel .
elliot wanted to be with me .
we were happy together .
but jeff and sheila ordered him to end the affair ,
and you couldn &apos;t accept that , could you ?
how &apos;d a local girl like you
get mixed up with a terrorist
like mikhail , anyway ?
take a look at this .
look at the photo .
look at the photo .
his name was amoka . he had a daughter ,
and he had grandchildren .
and now he &apos;s dead because of you .
mikhail contacted our office
looking to purchase a certain product we make .
but legal did a background check ,
and they refused the purchase order .
so a couple days later , mikhail calls the office ,
offers me $ 20,000 .
all i had to do was fake some invoices .
but instead of taking the money ,
you asked him to commit murder .
no . i took the cash , too .
my , oh , my , aren &apos;t you the opportunistic one .
let me ask you something , though .
why sarin ?
there are plenty of easier ways to kill people .
that &apos;s why .
that &apos;s why , isn &apos;t it ? because it &apos;s big and it &apos;s bold .
and you thought the cops would think it was a terrorist attack ,
and they &apos;d be so busy dealing with mass panic
that they &apos;d never think of murder .
it &apos;s pretty well calculated ,
i got to say .
you know what else ?
i don &apos;t think you ever loved elliot .
he was a payday for you .
in your twisted logic ,
jeff and sheila were the only thing
stopping you from cashing in .
and with them out of the way ,
elliot could take control of the company , right ?
and the two of you could be free
to carry on your relationship .
he was gonna divorce his wife and marry me .
but what good was that without money ?
well , you know what ? now you got nothing .
which is a real shame , because , uh ...
you could do with that money right now to pay for a lawyer .
you got another envelope ?
yeah . found this medal inside .
it &apos;s called the order of the rising sun .
it was awarded to a japanese pilot who bombed pearl harbor .
how did it end up in your father &apos;s toolbox ?
i don &apos;t know .
my grandfather served at pearl ,
and he died on the arizona .
maybe the same person who mailed my dad
the postcards from osaka mailed it to him .
why is it being returned to you now ?
everything that you &apos;ve received so far has had
something to do with wo fat .
what is his connection to this medal ?
i &apos;ll know when i find him .
no , that &apos;s the real one , huh ?
could you go to the beach with us ?
i &apos;d love nothing more than to go to the beach with you ,
okay ? but i &apos;m kind of low on sick days ,
so i got to get to work .
we &apos;ll hang out later , okay ?
all right ? come on .
hey , thanks for taking care of me in the hospital today , okay ?
i love you .
love you , too .
all right .
my lady .
in a way , i &apos;m glad this happened .
oh , you are ? you &apos;re glad that , uh ,
i got poisoned and almost died .
okay , not glad , exactly , but grateful .
the truth is , i was looking for any excuse to come home .
i thought you liked maui , but i &apos;m glad i could help .
stan only booked this trip
to see if we could save our marriage .
i don &apos;t know that there &apos;s anything left to save .
that &apos;s good .
you should get to work .
yeah .
we &apos;ll talk later ?
i look forward to it , yes .
hey . i &apos;m gone ten minutes , and everybody &apos;s
just standing around doing nothing , huh ?
who &apos;s this
oh , can &apos;t keep a good man down , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry ,
do we know you ?
whoa ! look at you !
