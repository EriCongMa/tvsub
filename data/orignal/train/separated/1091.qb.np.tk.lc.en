you aria ?
not now , wes .
and that was ?
that &apos;s wesley . my brother .
how long have you known ?
it &apos;s for you .
i don &apos;t know a james family in chicago .
wasn &apos;t that nate &apos;s real name ?
and this is definitely alison &apos;s handwriting .
&quot; you need to tell the beach hottie tonight . &quot;
what are they talking about ?
who is the beach hottie ?
ali never told me .
just tell me that there &apos;s more to this story ...
that &apos;s there &apos;s something that i don &apos;t know .
please , toby !
i &apos;m late .
have you told him ?
if he finds out , he &apos;s gonna kill me .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m about to meet my son .
what does this go to ?
that &apos;s what i would like you to find out .
and if you follow him ,
he &apos;ll lead you there .
emily-- you did the right thing .
what &apos;s wrong ?
look who else was in cape may .
nothing ?
nothing since he left .
well , he sent an &quot; i got here &quot; text .
well , that counts ...
if you want it to .
i mean , i know he &apos;s doing the right thing ,
it &apos;s just the idea that something &apos;s happening
hundreds of miles away that &apos;s gonna change everything .
this is cold . i &apos;m just gonna go get a refill .
do you think wilden read that notebook by now ?
he must have .
so he knows what we know .
and what exactly do we know ?
it &apos;s just cece &apos;s version of things .
there was a picture of him in cape bay .
i &apos;m going back to the police station after school ,
take a snap of it on my phone .
thanks .
spencer .
hey . jason .
i &apos;ve got some news .
we &apos;re keeping this kind of quiet .
but they &apos;ve released ali &apos;s remains to my family .
there &apos;s gonna be a re @-@ interment .
she &apos;s being buried again ?
not in the ground . in the mausoleum .
there &apos;ll be a service , family only ,
but i &apos;ve arranged for you
guys to have some time after my parents leave .
thank you .
there &apos;s someing else .
the things we put in the casket with ali , they &apos;re still missing .
the state police think whoever opened the grave
is keeping them as some kind of sick souvenirs .
the cops figure when they find those ,
they &apos;ll find the creeps who did this .
i think they &apos;re right .
look , i just wanted you guys to hear it from me .
i &apos;ll text you when i know
the details about saying good @-@ bye to ali .
don &apos;t bother . i &apos;ve said all the good @-@ byes i want to say .
spencer .
what ?
she &apos;s saint ali now ?
are her bones fully relics or something ?
you need to dial it back .
no , you dial it back .
i &apos;m finished with all of this .
you guys want to pay a visit to the crypt keeper , that &apos;s fine ,
it &apos;s your business , but keep me out of it !
we &apos;ll be there .
me and you are the only ones
with something from ali &apos;s casket .
i know .
so i say we get rid of them .
i &apos;ll ditch the ouija board thingie ,
and then you chuck those earrings .
i &apos;m not sure about that .
not sure about what ?
every time we react to something like this ,
it comes back to bite us on the ass .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re being
maneuvered into doing the absolute wrong thing .
i don &apos;t want to end up back in an orange jumpsuit again .
you think that i do ?
believe me , one size does not fit all .
so what do we do ?
i &apos;m gonna go to ezra &apos;s apartment after school .
so we &apos;ll just talk later .
why are you going to ezra &apos;s ?
because i ... water the plants , stuff like that .
oh . and do you do that while wearing his shirt ?
i &apos;m going now .
morning , spencer .
okay , someone &apos;s in a mood .
i just came by to remind
you that the decathlon &apos;s only a week away .
so in here is your schedule ,
hotel information , practice questions ,
and permission slip .
look , spencer ...
i know this is a touchy subject ,
but as team captain , i have to tell you
you &apos;ve been off your a @-@ game lately .
yeah . this is the biggest competition of the year ,
and i can &apos;t let your slip @-@ and @-@ slide affect the whole team .
let me make something clear to you , mona .
this is not a game to me-- at all .
good . because i &apos;d hate to see poor toby
travel all that way for you
only to be left cheering for me .
caleb .
hey . from my mom .
is everything okay ?
yeah , she &apos;s fine ,
it &apos;s just , uh ...
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s weird .
what is ?
my aunt moved to australia .
what &apos;s weird about that ?
it &apos;s my father &apos;s sister .
the one my mom left me with .
the one who put you in foster care ?
i guess my mom started looking for all of her broken connections ,
and she finally found my aunt ,
and my aunt is moving to brisbane .
they &apos;re closing her house .
wait . the one you were in when you were little ?
yeah . they &apos;re cleaning it out , tearing it down .
my mom said if i want to see the place ,
see if i want anything from it ,
i should ... i should go now .
are you thinking about going ?
no . i &apos;m not thinking about it , and i &apos;m not going .
caleb , if they tear it down .
i don &apos;t care .
let &apos; em .
hi .
hi .
i , uh , i didn &apos;t know anyone would be here .
is ezra back ?
no , he &apos;s not .
i was just checking on his place .
oh . come in .
thanks .
ezra said i could use the place if he was away .
you knew that he was gone .
he called me on his way to delaware .
he was a little vague about
how he found out about maggie and malcolm .
it wasn &apos;t vague , it was messy .
but the point is , he found out .
i should have taken the hit .
no . it--
look , he knows , he went there ,
and now he &apos;s talking to her .
so , do we have a problem , me staying here for a couple of nights ?
what ? no .
don &apos;t you have classes , though ?
no . they &apos;re , uh , fumigating the dorms .
first time since the clinton administration .
stay .
i mean , ezra invited you .
that way i don &apos;t have to worry about the plants .
okay . thanks .
okay . well , i will get out of your way .
maybe you should still check the plants .
i mean , i &apos;m not too good about that . i once killed a cactus .
i thought the only way you could do that was with a gun .
okay .
yeah , um , i &apos;ll call before i stop by .
bye .
four days ago , the kid bought a sandwich ,
tank of gas , and hydrangeas .
hydrangeas ?
yeah .
sixty @-@ five dollars of hydrangeas .
you know this ... ?
i &apos;m tracking his credit card .
okay , what about three days ago ?
three days ago he switched to cash .
someday he &apos;ll run out and i &apos;ll start tracking him again .
do you want to hear about the key ?
yeah .
this wasn &apos;t easy , but i
traced the numerical code to the manufacturer ,
manufacturer to a series of buildings on the west side of town ...
and ?
and if you want me to narrow it to a single doorway ,
i &apos;ll need a bit more ... encouragement .
you &apos;re wondering if it &apos;s worth it ?
no . not &quot; it . &quot;
you .
can i give you a piece of professional advice ?
my line of work , the people i follow--
criminals , sumbags , lowlifes , all of &apos; em .
okay , so ?
so never once have any of those guys bought hydrangeas
before skipping town .
you let me know about the key .
emily ?
what are you doing here , honey ?
i thought i &apos;d see if you wanted me to grab something for dinner .
oh ! yes , please . i had corn nuts for lunch .
from a vending machine ?
yeah .
i mistook it for actual food .
like , say , corn or nuts ?
i &apos;m just gonna get my wallet .
you know what ? change of plans .
let &apos;s just go out to dinner . i &apos;ll clock out early .
are you sure that &apos;s okay ?
what are they gonna do , arrest me ?
where did this come from ?
oh . uh , that &apos;s mine . i left it on the counter this morning .
you must have put it in your bag by accident .
all right , well , let me go sign out .
i &apos;ll be right back .
he was gone .
wilden read the notebook .
he knows we &apos;re on to him
what &apos;s happened ?
so ...
what exactly brings you to my office ?
look , i know you &apos;re in a funk , okay ?
i was the first one to hear about your break @-@ up .
and i didn &apos;t tell anyone until i knew you were ready .
i &apos;m on your side here .
i know .
is this what you left in ali &apos;s casket ?
that and twenty @-@ four other postcards .
someone put this in my mom &apos;s bag .
aria thought it was bad
getting those earrings back one at a time--
&quot; a &quot; has twenty @-@ five opportunities to set me up .
set us up .
just because it &apos;s your memento
doesen &apos;t mean it can &apos;t be planted on any of us .
&quot; a &quot; is threatening to kill me if i go after wilden .
does that mean he murdered ali ?
or that he &apos;s part of &quot; a &apos;s &quot; entourage ?
that is not what this message says .
&quot; la police &quot; are &quot; capable de murder . &quot;
i took french , spencer .
for a semester .
&quot; arrete de creuser .
&quot; la police sait deja que c &apos;est toi
qui est capable de meurtre . &quot;
translation : &quot; stop digging .
&quot; the police already know it &apos;s you
who is capable of murder . &quot;
wow . that sounded so much better in french .
they mean nate .
look , you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
okay ? even the police know that .
emily , that freak was gonna kill you and paige .
thank you for the french lesson .
i have to go to work soon , so ....
emily .
i meant to throw that out already .
that too .
i don &apos;t know what happened with you and toby ...
and i know you &apos;re not ready to talk about it .
but i am here for you . we &apos;re all here for you .
you can &apos;t just push us away that easily .
last week hanna saw paige with another girl .
she assumed the worst .
she thought that paige was seeing someone else .
she wasn &apos;t .
i talked to her , and she was trying to help us figure out
who bought that queen of hearts costume on halloween .
the girl that hanna was so worried about works at a costume shop .
she was a flirt , not a threat .
did she find out who bought it ?
not yet .
the point is , sometimes things look bad , and they &apos;re really not .
sometimes there &apos;s another explanation for what &apos;s going on .
and what if that explanation is even worse ?
so what &apos;s he like ? the brother .
he &apos;s all right . a little bit full of himself , though .
is he cute ?
he &apos;s kinda cute .
he &apos;s just way too comfortable
living off of his trust fund , though .
i would not mind getting cozy with one of those .
trust fund .
look , i gotta go . i gotta make caleb dinner .
huh @-@ ho ! so is that how you bribed
caleb into going out to his aunt &apos;s house tomorrow ?
a little . i just explained that
this might be his only chance to say good @-@ bye .
hey , give me the earrings . i &apos;ll take them tonight .
um , i &apos;m not ready to do that .
well , you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;ll get rid of them with the ouija board piece .
okay , you can do whatever you want , but i &apos;m gonna wait .
look aria , you &apos;re making a mistake .
well , it &apos;s my mistake .
is this a new couch ?
it &apos;s a rental . just about everything here is .
i wanted to make a fresh start in a new office .
i &apos;m here until i find the right one .
i don &apos;t officially start seeing people until next week .
well , thanks for letting me come in .
mona &apos;s back at school .
like you said , therapy and the right meds
and she &apos;d be ready to rejoin society .
did you come here to talk about mona ?
i came because ...
not talking isn &apos;t working .
you may have heard i killed a guy .
i heard that you and a classmate were attacked by someone ,
the same person who killed maya .
you were defending yourself , emily .
what you did was incredibly--
dr. sullivan , no . that &apos;s not what i said .
that &apos;s not what i want to talk about .
everyone wants to talk about how i &apos;m some kind of hero .
everyone tells me i--
i killed someone .
someone had a life ,
someone was a living , breathing person ,
and i--
you killed someone .
i know what he was planning to do ,
who he really was .
in my head , i know .
but then i close my eyes and i can see myself ...
holding that knife ...
it was in my hand
and i can still feel what it felt like when it--
emily , have you ever thought about trying hypnotherapy ?
i remember what happened , dr. sullivan .
that &apos;s the problem-- i remember exactly what happened .
hypnotherapy isn &apos;t just
about bringing back memories we &apos;ve repressed .
sometimes it &apos;s about reframing the ones we have ,
the ones that are controlling our lives ,
controlling the way we see ourselves .
how soon can we start ?
hello ?
hi . it &apos;s spencer .
um , how much more &quot; encouragement &quot; do you need ?
five hundred ...
cash .
fine . keep looking .
just about everything here now .
you &apos;re looking at about a hundred years &apos; worth of stuff .
did you grow up here , mr. doyle ?
jamie . yeah , i did .
my sister patty , caleb &apos;s aunt ,
stayed and took care of
our folks when they got old . i was long gone .
and so was caleb &apos;s dad ?
yeah . he was gone too .
patty was surprised to hear from your mom .
yeah , i bet she was .
are you being rude on purpose ?
i just don &apos;t want to be
here all day going through this crap , okay ?
well , at least look at the stuff before you throw it away .
how long has it been since you &apos;ve seen your uncle ?
a long time .
i only saw him like once or twice a year when i was a kid .
took me to a few phillies games .
that must have been nice .
he just felt guilty that his brother ran out on me .
that &apos;s a decent chunk of change .
the other girls are coming by the cemetery tonight around seven .
sounds like a real party .
hey , what is your problem , spencer ?
you got a prior engagement or something ?
she was your best friend .
look , if you got something to say , say it .
you don &apos;t want to have this fight with me , jason .
not now . i &apos;ll win , and it won &apos;t feel good for either of us .
no ! wait . you can donate these books to a library .
come on , they &apos;re all moldy .
i used to love picture books . i might want to keep &apos; em .
uh , if you happen to find mike mulligan &apos;s steam shovel in there ,
i &apos;ll take it .
deal .
he turned into a good @-@ looking young man .
he treats you right ?
he does .
good .
do you ever hear from his father ?
uh ... nobody does .
it &apos;s no great loss . he &apos;s not the sort of man people miss .
caleb &apos;s never really talked about family much ,
and then his mom found him ,
and it kind of ... changed things .
i &apos;m glad she found him .
i &apos;ve never met her . did you know her ?
yes . uh ... she deserved better .
most people deserve better than they get .
so you saw them together ? caleb &apos;s mom and dad .
yeah .
did they love each other ?
even for a little while ?
i think so .
then why would he leave them ?
yeah ... he said he needed some space .
figured he &apos;d come back when he could handle being a dad .
the thing is , when you walk out , the people you leave ...
they keep on having a life .
they don &apos;t wait for you to come back .
you &apos;re in a safe space , emily .
no one can harm you here .
when i tell you to wake up , you will remember everything ,
then you will tell me what you remember .
okay , wake up .
i want you to tell me everything that happened that night .
that night .
at the lighthouse .
you and your friend were in danger .
are you there now ?
yes .
good .
hey . the plants have been calling out for you .
i know , i heard them crying for me
all the way down the hall .
have you heard from him ?
no . that doesn &apos;t mean he isn &apos;t thinking about you .
yeah ? what does it mean ?
are you gonna get that ?
probably just a junk call .
no , it could be ezra . he knows that you &apos;re here .
hello .
wrong number .
hey , you hungry ?
yeah , i guess so .
all right , come on . i need some air anyway .
okay .
tell me what you see .
i &apos;m walking ...
i don &apos;t know where i am .
it &apos;s dark ...
really dark .
take a look around , emily . do you see the lighthouse ?
someone just turned on the sprinklers .
is there anyone else there with you ?
i see her .
you see paige ?
she &apos;s looking at me . i think she knows she &apos;s gonna die .
we shouldn &apos;t be here .
this is bad . we shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
oh , my god .
no ! please , no !
tell me what you see .
i &apos;d like to wake up now !
emily , you &apos;re in a safe space . tell me what you see .
i see ...
the murder weapon .
you have to stop !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
you can &apos;t do this !
stop ! stop ! ! !
stop ! ! !
what happened ?
you broke out of the hypnosis .
do you remember what you saw ?
you were talking about nate , you saw the murder weapon ,
and then you just started yelling .
emily .
emily !
sorry . i have to go .
all right , i &apos;m gonna put this stuff in the car and can we get going ?
bye , uncle jamie .
bye , caleb .
thank you , mr. doyle .
or ... jamie .
yeah .
you sure you kids don &apos;t wanna
go down the road , get a hamburger ? i &apos;m buying .
i think caleb really wants to get going .
right .
hanna .
i found this over there , bottom of a dresser .
look on the back .
&quot; caleb 6 months . &quot;
yeah .
the way he &apos;s feeling , i &apos;m not sure he &apos;d want it right now ,
so maybe you could hold onto it for him .
just until he wants to see it .
yeah .
yeah , i will . thank you .
hanna .
um ... i &apos;ve gotta get going .
yeah . you make sure he takes care of you .
yeah , he will .
hey , you &apos;ve reached hanna &apos;s phone . leave a message .
we &apos;re supposed to be studying .
are you planning a trip ?
you and me and sweet paree ?
how does that sound ?
maybe we should learn how to parle fran ? ais before we go .
well , we could start in the south of france ,
dancing through sunflower fields ,
lounging around in our bikinis in the french riviera .
you &apos;d look so good on top of the eiffel tower ...
wind in your hair ...
how long are we going away for ?
how about forever ?
hey . when &apos;d you get back ?
uh , a little while ago .
honey ?
no . i can &apos;t let you do that .
do what ?
act like i &apos;m innocent .
like i &apos;m still the same sweet little girl that i &apos;ve always been .
i &apos;m not . i can &apos;t be .
sweetheart , i know who you are ,
and you would never
deliberately do anything to hurt another person .
i &apos;m not so sure about that anymore .
emily !
emily , i am your mother ,
and that means that i can see you , all of you ,
sometimes better than you can see yourself ,
and there &apos;s only good there .
look-- look at me !
i promise you , there &apos;s only good there .
it &apos;s a unit in a small building on mayflower hill .
what do you think &apos;s behind the door , spencer ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , what do you hope is behind the door ?
we had a secret , him and me ...
and this will tell me whether he kept it .
did you ever play the game with the flowers when you were little ,
&quot; he loves me , he loves me not &quot; ?
he loves me , he loves me not ...
the trick is , you just
find a flower with the odd number of petals .
buttercups .
marigolds .
how many petals are on a hydrangea ?
so , you ...
open the door , and ...
i open the door ,
and if it &apos;s full of the things that i think it is ,
then it means that there &apos;s hope .
that means that he loves me ,
and that i wasn &apos;t wrong about us .
and if not--
if not ...
it &apos;s time to let him go .
ezra taught me to drive when i was twelve .
he taught you to drive when you were twelve ?
he said i should learn to do it right the first time .
fitzgerald .
i been lookin &apos; for you .
your mother fixed the board , but she can &apos;t buy me off .
mr. kaplan , funny running into you like this .
let &apos;s see that pretty smile
after i bounce your face off the curb .
come on !
wait . wait .
who the hell was that ?
my physics teacher &apos;s husband .
what kind of school do you go to ?
why was the husband of your physics teacher trying to strangle you ?
if you want to blame somebody ,
you can blame my mother .
oh , i &apos;d love to ,
but what exactly would i be blaming her for ?
ezra taught me how to drive ,
but he never taught me how to get away from our family .
i thought you liked your world .
i thought so too .
when ezra left home , our mom was furious . so was i.
it took me a long time to realize
i wasn &apos;t angry at him for leaving .
i was pissed because he didn &apos;t take me with him .
why did you want to go with him ?
because he &apos;s not the only one with dreams .
but if i was gonna get free , i &apos;d have to do it on my own .
so i thought getting thrown out of prep school
would be a good start .
if i failed enough courses , broke enough rules ...
what happened ?
my mother made every infraction disappear
with the wave of her checkbook .
still brings us back to
the man that you hit with our leftover pizza .
yeah , desperate times call for desperate measures .
i went for the one really crazy thing i knew
would cause maximum trouble .
you hit on your physics teacher .
who is very attractive ,
in an intellectual cougar sort of way .
well , did it work ?
academic suspension and an irate husband .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m hiding here .
that &apos;s the stupidest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
look , before ezra , my family was as predictable as the tides .
one day ezra just had enough and walked out .
my mom hurled lightning bolts , but he survived .
and more important , he found you .
he found you and said , &quot; that &apos;s who i want . &quot;
you &apos;re the most amazing part of this .
that &apos;s why my mother hates you .
why ?
because you &apos;re unexpected .
that was a day shot .
i don &apos;t really know what you were expecting .
just thought that you could have a chance to ... reconnect .
well , silence your inner oprah , okay ? it &apos;s just an old house .
your uncle was nice .
yeah , i thought they were all nice ,
until they shipped me off .
you could have asked him why they did that .
some things you &apos;re better off not knowing .
i suppose .
besides , it wasn &apos;t his call , okay ?
caleb ...
if i show you something ,
can you promise not to get angry ?
that &apos;s you ...
when you were a baby .
where did you get this ?
your uncle jamie gave it to me when we were leaving .
he wanted to make sure that you didn &apos;t throw it away .
um ... w @-@ where was it ?
in the shed someplace ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you see how the edges are kind of bent ?
i think he took it from his wallet .
why would have a picture of me in his wallet ?
i can think of a reason .
the man holding you ...
that ring ...
jamie had the same ring on today .
he knew you before you were five .
not a chance .
dr. sullivan !
i was hoping i &apos;d catch you .
mona , what are you doing here ?
i heard you were reopening your practice ,
so i thought i &apos;d come by and give you this .
it &apos;s a housewarming present for the new office .
and i just wanted you to know that i &apos;m doing so much better .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
oh , what a cute little space !
i bet the orchid would look great on that windowsill .
i &apos;m actually leaving for a few days ,
so i will make sure it gets some water .
good thinking .
it was very thoughtful of you , mona .
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
i could never really repay you for what you did .
bye .
so shall we just wait , or ... ?
i &apos;m pretty sure she &apos;s not coming .
&quot; unable are the loved to die , for love is immortality . &quot;
that &apos;s creepy .
it &apos;s emily dickinson .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s santa claus , consider me creeped .
it &apos;s okay . it is a touch creepy in here .
my parents barely stayed two minutes .
hey , you okay ?
spencer . you changed your mind .
no . i just knew that i could find you here .
i do have something to say to you .
spencer .
ali was pregnant when she died .
what ?
what is she talking about ? is this true ?
we can &apos;t know for sure . emily looked it up ,
and her early pregnancy wouldn &apos;t have shown up in an autopsy .
isn &apos;t that right , em ?
you have no idea what you &apos;re saying right now .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
how do you know about this ?
i mean , who would she have--
who &apos;s the father ?
oh , that &apos;s the best part .
who , spencer ?
spencer , don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t care !
don &apos;t do this . not here , spencer .
detective wilden .
one of rosewood &apos;s finest .
please tell me this is part of some brilliant spencer plan .
it &apos;s not .
she &apos;s just hurting and wants us to hurt just as bad .
we &apos;re your friends , we &apos;re not your punching bags .
okay , so how are we gonna fix this ? what are we telling jason ?
forget jason . there &apos;s something really wrong with spencer .
i mean , this is bigger than toby leaving .
i &apos;m heartbroken too , but she just seems ...
broken .
it &apos;s one thing to doubt the person you &apos;re with--
if they ever loved you , if they didn &apos;t--
it &apos;s something else entirely when you start to doubt yourself .
do you hear that ?
you mean the sprinklers ?
i heard it that night . not in ali &apos;s yard , at her grave .
i mixed up the nightmares .
we shouldn &apos;t be here .
this is bad . we shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
you have to stop !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ? ! you can &apos;t do this !
stop ! stop !
stop ! ! !
the girl-- the girl in the red coat .
it all happened right here .
i didn &apos;t hurt her .
ali ? of course not .
wait , so this was after
jenna and noel picked you up from the diner ?
