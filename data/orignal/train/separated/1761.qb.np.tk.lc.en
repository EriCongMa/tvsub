two one six four two zero
one nine eight nine .
and that , little lady , is pi to a thousand places .
i &apos;d say i &apos;m sorry i asked ,
except i didn &apos;t .
oh , look , it &apos;s the scientific american
that covered the paper leonard and i wrote .
oh , let me see .
i have mixed feelings about doing interviews .
i like the part where i talk .
i do not like the part where the other man talks .
sheldon , this article doesn &apos;t mention leonard at all .
well , that can &apos;t be right .
it only refers to &quot; dr. cooper and his team . &quot;
did you even talk about him ?
all i did was answer a few questions about the theory .
and then expressed my gratitude that scientific american
doesn &apos;t include any of those smelly perfume cards .
poor leonard .
why ? the theory he came up with
just got mentioned in scientific american .
he ought to be thrilled .
he might not be .
oh , maybe you &apos;re right .
he is kind of a lump .
think about it .
how would you feel if you were referred to
as part of leonard &apos;s team ?
oh , i &apos;d be incensed .
so you see what i &apos;m getting at ?
squeaky wheel gets the grease ?
no .
grass is always greener ?
try again .
well , i don &apos;t know-- we &apos;re all groot ?
just tell me .
leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are ,
and he was overlooked .
he &apos;s going to feel bad .
but it wasn &apos;t my fault .
i didn &apos;t exclude him .
and i didn &apos;t write the article .
remember that time you didn &apos;t get picked to
pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland
and they let that other kid do it ?
oh , that kid !
poor leonard .
exactly .
for the record , that kid was a terrible choice .
if you cry when you drop your churro ,
you do not have what it takes to rule england .
thanks for helping us sort through all my mom &apos;s stuff .
of course .
i know what it &apos;s like
having to go through a loved one &apos;s possessions .
my uncle was a worshipper of krishna .
but after he died , you know what we found ?
a statue of shiva .
it may not be crips and bloods , okay ?
but in india , it &apos;s a thing .
well , it &apos;ll be good that you &apos;re there .
howard &apos;s been having trouble deciding
what to keep and what to let go .
well , it &apos;s hard .
a lot of ma &apos;s stuff brings back fond memories .
is that why you couldn &apos;t get rid of
her drawer full of ketchup packets ?
yes .
it reminds me of us eating out and her saying ,
&quot; quick , nobody &apos;s looking , fill your pockets with ketchup . &quot;
leonard ?
have you ever noticed
that only my name is on the cable bill ?
yeah .
good , good .
and your name is on the electric bill
and mine isn &apos;t .
and i &apos;m okay with that .
actually , your name is on the electric bill .
oh , right .
this is a disaster .
i don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re talking about and i agree .
okay , i have to tell you something ,
but you &apos;re not going to like it .
what &apos;s going on ?
an article was just published
in scientific american about our theory .
did they hate it ?
no . no , they loved it .
they , uh , couldn &apos;t say enough nice things about it .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
you know how the pennysaver only has my name ...
sheldon !
they didn &apos;t mention you in the article .
only me .
really ?
i know .
it &apos;s not fair .
let the anger go , buddy .
you just ...
you relax all your muscles .
except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter .
let &apos;s keep those tight .
uh , that @-@ that &apos;s not necessary .
it is-- they &apos;re what hold back the urine and the feces .
look , maybe @-@ maybe you shouldn &apos;t read it .
it &apos;ll only make you feel worse .
&quot; cooper and his team &quot; ?
you should know i had nothing to do with that .
at least they &apos;re talking about the theory .
i mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
you know , you &apos;re right .
yeah . you know , it &apos;s like when stan lee and steve ditko
created spider @-@ man .
stan lee may get all the credit ,
but steve ditko knows he was just as important .
even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies .
and @-@ and he &apos;s far richer .
and he &apos;s a household name , you know ?
whereas , you know , you say ditko ,
and that sounds like a company that makes dits .
that &apos;s not helping .
well , i &apos;d give more examples ,
but , well , everyone in your position &apos;s so forgettable .
stuart , we &apos;re here .
it &apos;s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom &apos;s house .
yeah , well , i tried putting him out on the curb ,
but nobody took him .
just so you know , the power &apos;s out .
what happened ?
i called , they said a transformer blew .
it &apos;s the whole block .
should be fixed by tomorrow .
wait , when did it go out ?
in the middle of the night .
oh , my god .
howie , what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s all defrosting .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just food .
it &apos;s not just food .
this is the last food my mother ever made .
this is her last brisket .
this is her last meatloaf .
this is her last ...
i have no idea what this is , but ...
it &apos;s the last one .
everything okay ?
no .
all ma &apos;s food is gonna be ruined .
well , why don &apos;t we take it home and put it in our freezer ?
you don &apos;t want to do that .
refreezing not only removes moisture ,
but it creates ice crystals in the fibers of the meat
that can compromise its taste and texture .
what ? i saw a teachable moment .
i dropped some culinary science .
what should we do ?
i &apos;ll tell you exactly what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna eat it .
there &apos;s , like , 20 pounds of food in there .
all you said was i had to get rid of things .
you didn &apos;t say they couldn &apos;t pass through my colon first .
howie ...
okay .
then how about this ?
let &apos;s invite everyone over to dinner .
it &apos;ll be like ma &apos;s feeding us one last time .
i love that .
me , too .
oh , look , we &apos;ve got enough ketchup
to cover every ounce of it .
i mean , who even reads scientific american ?
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
if it &apos;s such a big deal , how come the biggest celebrity
they could get for the cover is a molecule ?
can we please just stop talking about it ?
i &apos;m sorry . what can i do ?
nothing , i &apos;m fine .
no , no . i &apos;m gonna cheer you up .
here we go .
what are we doing ?
i am taking you shopping .
my baby is sad , and i &apos;m gonna make him happy again .
look , i know shopping cheers you up ,
but it &apos;s just not really my thing .
well , what about this helicopter
you control with an ipad ?
does it have a camera in it ?
it does have a camera in it .
baby &apos;s listening .
leonard ?
leonard ? leonard ?
what ?
i spoke to the reporter at the magazine .
what happened ? did you tell him it was my idea ?
i did .
thank you . what did he say ?
he said they made the editorial decision
to only cite the lead scientist .
why did he think you &apos;re the lead scientist ?
it was my idea !
you know , for an extra four bucks ,
i can have this thing here tomorrow .
well , i know it was your idea ,
but the reporter said he &apos;s been following my work for a while ,
and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine
is &apos; cause my name is on it .
you know what ? i did it . what &apos;s four bucks ?
if you &apos;re trying to make me feel better ,
it &apos;s not working .
well ... then what if i told you
that i added your name to the cable bill ?
no .
that &apos;s just as well . they had me on hold for 20 minutes
and i hung up . i ...
leonard ? leonard ?
leonard ?
also , wolowitz invited us all to dinner , so ...
i &apos;m ready whenever you are .
all he had was an idea .
well , that is an important part .
oh , please !
i have ideas all day long .
reverse seaworld where dolphins are allowed to pet people .
a new clothing size between medium and large called marge .
snow white retold from the point of view of sneezy .
喷嚏精 开心果 迷糊鬼 爱生气
why won &apos;t doc prescribe him something ?
we finally find out .
but leonard &apos;s idea was good .
fine . then grumpy-- what &apos;s he so grumpy about ?
maybe his girlfriend won &apos;t take his side .
i &apos;m the one who thought of it !
well , didn &apos;t he do a lot of the work ?
but now he &apos;s happy to let people think
he &apos;s responsible for everything .
and that &apos;s why you get an ipad helicopter !
is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does ?
it &apos;s not your fault .
is it my fault that my name came first
on the paper alphabetically ?
not your fault .
is it my fault that when the reporter cited me
as the lead scientist i didn &apos;t correct him ?
hey , look at that pretty bird .
he always needs all the attention .
he &apos;s such a baby .
i know , i know .
i swear , he is never ever playing with my helicopter .
okay , i &apos;ll start heating some of this stuff up .
thanks .
oh , man .
this is the boutonniere from my high school prom ...
... a piece of cake from my bar mitzvah .
did she throw anything away ?
no .
if i find my foreskin , i &apos;m gonna kill myself .
okay , so we &apos;ve got , um ,
three briskets , four meatloafs , one lasagna ...
no , that &apos;s noodle kugel .
one jewish lasagna ...
... two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each ,
and one giant container of matzah ball soup .
ma always kept it on hand ,
in case i got sick .
she thought she could cure anything with her cooking .
even the time i got food poisoning .
from her cooking .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m okay .
let &apos;s get started .
you got it .
i &apos;m never gonna talk to her again .
should we tell everyone not to come ?
no . i want to do this .
okay . well , i &apos;ll keep it together if you can .
okay .
i &apos;m not making any promises !
glad you guys could make it .
of course .
wow , it looks really pretty in here .
yeah , turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood .
so , stuart , have you thought about what you &apos;d do
if howard sells the house ?
and there goes the mood .
hi . hello .
oh , and a special hello to leonard ,
who needs to be mentioned by name .
subtle .
but you got it , right ?
hey , guys .
i just want everyone to know ,
uh , tonight &apos;s not a sad occasion .
yeah , we just want to have the kind of dinner
that we &apos;ve all had here so many times before .
good food , good friends , and sometime around midnight ,
heartburn that makes you pray for death .
do you need any help in the kitchen ?
no , we got it . you guys make yourselves comfortable .
all right , hey , you two , we &apos;re here for howard right now , okay ?
yes , so please behave yourselves .
fine .
of course .
so i heard you two , uh , wrote a paper together .
how &apos;s that going ?
this food is amazing .
mm , and not a vegetable in sight .
that &apos;s not true .
we &apos;ve got tomatoes right here .
all these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight .
feels like we could be an 18th century french salon .
indeed .
penny , a salon is a gathering
where intellectuals entertained each other
with sparkling conversations about issues of the day .
oh , so it &apos;s like the view .
sheldon , the view is a daytime talk show hosted by women .
oh , i &apos;m aware .
it features whoopi goldberg .
she played guinan on star trek : next gen.
penny , next gen refers to
star trek ...
shut up .
i would like to propose a salon topic .
ooh , please do , rajesh .
the lead in the hunger games is a woman .
marvel has made &quot; tor &quot; a female .
wait , who &apos;s tor ?
you know , tor , the god of &quot; tunder . &quot;
as i was saying , is this a sign
that our society is approaching gender equality ?
certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now .
it &apos;s true .
at the store , i had to put a seat on the toilet .
we won &apos;t know if there &apos;s equality
until female thor has a baby
and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work .
i wonder if only a baby who is worthy
can suckle at the bosom of thor .
okay , new salon topic .
salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago
or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes ?
discuss .
i don &apos;t believe it matters what the topic is .
what &apos;s crucial for a salon
is that we conduct the discussion
in an elevated and insightful way .
it &apos;s all about the execution .
of course you &apos;d focus on that rather than the inspiration .
uh , new salon topic .
what &apos;s more important , an idea or its execution ?
oh , that &apos;s fun .
yeah , good for you , leonard .
that &apos;s a lovely little notion .
kind of like ,
&quot; i wish i could talk to my uncle in chicago . &quot;
yeah , now stand back while i invent the telephone .
&quot; hello ? oh , hold on . &quot;
leonard , it &apos;s your uncle .
he says you just got burned .
sheldon .
you guys .
no , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion .
at least i am .
howard , what do you think ?
well , i guess , as an engineer ,
lean towards execution .
i spend my days trying to take
ideas and make them real .
well said , old chap .
i thought eloquence had died ; here it stands before us .
starting today , it &apos;ll go : gettysburg address ,
《 我有一个梦想 》 则是马丁 · 路德 · 金最著名的一场演说
&quot; i have a dream &quot; and what you just said .
oh , now he &apos;s a genius ?
all you ever do is make fun of him and engineering .
leonard , please . his mother just died .
you &apos;re being ridiculous .
yeah , so are you .
guys , if i wanted to hear people be bitchy ,
i &apos;d go to my real salon .
leonard , lots of people could &apos;ve had that idea ,
but very few people could &apos;ve worked out the math the way i did .
lots of people also didn &apos;t have that idea ,
like everyone in the entire world except for me .
oh , well , apparently leonard thinks
he &apos;s better than everyone in the whole world ,
including those fighting for our freedom .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i support our boys overseas .
and girls .
hey , you already ruined thor ; give it a rest .
so i &apos;m just supposed to be okay
with you hogging all the credit ? !
i didn &apos;t hog anything .
unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it .
you want some of this ?
i &apos;ll give you some .
sheldon , leonard , living room , right now !
she said my name first ; that must kill you .
i don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;re doing ,
but this is a very difficult time for my husband !
we &apos;re eating the last food his mother ever made ,
and you were gonna throw it at each other like children ? !
whatever it is you &apos;re fighting about , put it aside ,
go back in there and be a good friend to howard
or there &apos;s no dessert for either of you !
look at me when i &apos;m talking to you !
and don &apos;t think ...
you guys ever notice sometimes
bernadette sounds like my mom ?
i don &apos;t hear it .
no , not at all .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve eaten that much in my entire life .
it &apos;s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years .
曾在沙漠度过40年的漂泊帐篷生活
took that long to walk it off .
you see , penny , the israelites were in the desert ...
shut up !
so glad you two are done fighting .
right now , i &apos;m just trying to burp without throwing up .
hang on .
physics today mentioned the paper .
what &apos;d they say ?
who cares ? did they mention leonard ?
they did .
yay .
good news , i found more tums .
yay !
