* simpsons time *
* run , don &apos;t walk *
* you might even hear *
* maggie talk *
* bart the boy and a dog named homer *
* and jokes written on signs *
* it &apos;s simpsons time *
what a beautiful day for a family stroll .
tell that to my aching back !
it &apos;s not a family stroll ...
homer forgot where he parked his car last night ,
and now we have to find it .
what a beautiful day to be in denial .
yeah , bart. who cares ?
the sun is shining , birds are singing ...
people are staring up at the sky in terror ?
do you see it , lisa ?
there &apos;s ... nothing ... there .
and that &apos;s where lard lad used to be !
oh , looks like we better file a report
with the bureau of missing statues .
yeah . be like that time that rodin statue got stolen .
what was the name of that statue again ?
ah , let me think .
thinkin &apos; .
yeah , still thinkin &apos; .
still thinkin &apos; .
uh , either we can fan out and search ,
or bunch up and riot .
oh , balderdash and poppycock . i say we do not riot .
riot !
don &apos;t !
riot !
don &apos;t !
riot !
and thanks to the equal number of nonrioters ,
the total cost of the damage is zero dollars .
homer , were you in that riot ?
marge , please .
i &apos;m a leader in this community .
in response to the outcry ,
lard lad &apos;s parent company ,
tianjin mining and smelting and donuts ,
has issued the following statement :
&quot; we are rebranding lard lad with an updated statue . &quot;
rebranding .
that just means admitting failure , dad .
admitting failure .
people of springfield ,
please welcome mr ....
i know i &apos;m gonna mangle this ... lee fong .
uh , actually , it &apos;s pronounced robert chan .
and now , please welcome the model for the original lard lad ,
mr. laird lad .
a lot of crazy names today .
ladies and gentlemen , i give you lard lad &apos;s bold ,
focus @-@ grouped , new look !
that doesn &apos;t say donuts !
that says management overthink !
the thinker !
that statue &apos;s called the thinker .
what ? what are we on now ?
what ?
people , let &apos;s give the new statue a chance .
when the eiffel tower was first built ,
many said it was a steel monstrosity .
it still is .
fine , but maybe this will grow on you .
aw , this thing sucks .
i don &apos;t think so .
well , at @-@ at @-@ at a certain angle ...
it &apos;s beautiful .
we love it .
that &apos;s beautiful .
you fools !
you &apos;ve erected a massive concave reflective surface .
it will focus the sun &apos;s beam in a deadly ray .
昨天刚关门
yeah !
yeah !
first off , i &apos;d like to thank the good people
at tianjin smelting and mining and donuts and tarps
for neutralizing our wonderful , deadly , new lard lad .
yeah , that &apos;s great .
they &apos;ll grow back .
the time for mourning and blaming our mayors has passed .
we will rebuild .
we will rebuild .
we will rebuild .
we will rebuild !
we will rebuild !
已过去259233分钟
we will rebuild .
we will rebuild .
i guess there &apos;s only one man we can turn to .
supergirl ? !
so ... you &apos;d like me to save the town .
well , you &apos;ve got gumption , i &apos;ll give you that .
and such an adorable baby ,
it really restores my ... my faith in ... in the , uh ...
smithers , where is the damn trapdoor button ?
mr. burns , you already trap @-@ doored us
from your upstairs office .
yes .
and how was your fall ?
painful ? unexpected ?
oh , yeah .
worst i &apos;ve ever had .
oh ! really ...
really ...
pulled something .
totally painful .
did not see it coming .
excellent .
so ... remind me what i was saying no to .
funding repairs to the town .
but if you could do even one little project .
reducking the duck pond
or fixing up the springfield bowl .
the springfield bowl .
very well .
i will rebuild this town on one condition .
forget it .
our desperate plea is nonnegotiable .
i want to put on a variety show at the bowl .
a celebration of everything wonderful about ...
what &apos;s the name of this town again ?
springfield , sir .
yes , i will destroy springfield .
celebrate , sir .
fine , we will try your way first .
springfield has risen from the ashes like a phoenix .
that &apos;s phoenix , the mythical bird ,
not phoenix , the cultureless , mars @-@ scape of the southwest .
our unlikely angel ,
the devil himself , c. montgomery burns .
thank you , kent .
and don &apos;t forget the open auditions
for my springfield follies .
this year women may audition , too ,
with permission of husband ,
father and pastor in writing .
next .
* un bel di , vedremo *
* levarsi un fil di fumo *
puccini &apos;s a little well @-@ trod , don &apos;t you think ?
this isn &apos;t right .
this isn &apos;t how it was at all .
i remember that night so vividly .
monty , time to go on stage .
yes , mama .
your little butterscotch drop won &apos;t let you down .
aw , who &apos;s candy ?
you &apos;s candy .
oh , i &apos;m gonna lick you , my sweet little lolly .
who likes mommy &apos;s licks ?
monty likes mommy &apos;s licks .
lickity , lickity , lick .
but the butterscotch soon turned to bitter squelch .
i want everything just as it was back then .
the stage filled with children
like those from 1913 .
high @-@ spirited , snaggletoothed ,
and willing to work 18 hours a day .
attention .
an old man is prowling the school , looking for young children .
please , perform for him .
watch me make this nerd disappear .
also ...
excellent villain .
and my cast is complete .
i &apos;ll just save the list and ...
samson himself could not pry open these jaws .
can i help you , sir ?
oh , women aren &apos;t meant for clasp opening .
young lady , if there &apos;s one thing i know about show business ,
it &apos;s that there are a lot of clipboards .
how would you like to be my assistant director ?
and i &apos;ll be perfectly positioned
to find out exactly what mr. burns is really up to .
i &apos;m in .
and if you need another act ,
i also play this .
there &apos;s no room in my show
for adolphe sax &apos;s vile @-@ sounding o @-@ phone .
do you ever say anything in a simple way ?
shut up .
well , that was clear .
hey , homer , are you sure we haven &apos;t let the plant
slip with mr. burns gone ?
smitty , as a wise , old man once said ,
&quot; out with the old ...
and in with the brew . &quot;
that &apos;s enough .
but i haven &apos;t started my act .
muntz , what have you got ?
a rabbit in a bag .
ooh , a promising magic trick .
no , it &apos;s my lunch .
bah ! you &apos;re all incompetent .
i won &apos;t go through this a second time .
second time ?
is there something you &apos;re not telling us ?
a vast amount .
and what part of &quot; what i &apos;ve never told you &quot;
don &apos;t you understand ?
mother , what is that sound they &apos;re making ?
well , it &apos;s called laughter .
you &apos;re a laughingstock , charles .
oh , oh , it &apos;s awful .
this show isn &apos;t good enough .
no show could be good enough .
it &apos;s not ?
what are you doing ?
getting ready for monday .
i &apos;m gonna fill a super soaker full of lemonade ,
carl &apos;s gonna fill one with iced tea ,
and we &apos;re gonna arnold palmer lenny
when he walks in .
arnold palmer lenny .
you &apos;re going to arnold palmer lenny .
yeah , you see , arnold palmer was a golfer
and he made up this drink
where it &apos;s not a full glass of lemonade
or a full glass of iced tea .
instead ...
homie , i &apos;m worried about all this silliness at work .
you &apos;re the safety inspector .
i &apos;m a safety inspector .
not the .
i &apos;ve never seen another .
what ... wait , one safety inspector ?
for the whole nuclear plant ?
that &apos;s insane .
put everything in the car and get out of town .
i &apos;ll find you , if there are still roads !
sweetie , sweetie ,
all you &apos;ve got to do is be responsible .
your friends consider you the leader
because you &apos;re a little taller .
with above @-@ average height comes above @-@ average responsibility .
marge , thank you for setting me straight .
you &apos;re welcome .
okay , i want to open this show
with someone being shot into a cannon .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
well , because , see , that &apos;s impossible .
everyone , little miss nitpick hates the show ,
so i &apos;m shutting it down .
this was an act .
now it &apos;s just bullying .
thanks a lot , lisa .
we were getting out of school for this .
well if isn &apos;t the little girl that made a billionaire cry .
may i please speak with mr. burns ?
no , he &apos;s very busy .
won &apos;t you please come back and do the show ?
shan &apos;t .
oh , that bell has quite the recoil .
oh , what is bothering him ?
and what were those weird lines around his eyes ?
i know .
it &apos;s such a tragedy on that beautiful face .
come here .
well , there &apos;s only one explanation for those lines , lisa .
he &apos;s been watching something on the mutoscope .
so , if i play this ,
i &apos;ll know the answer .
it , uh , costs a nickel .
so this is what made mr. burns the monster he is .
within days
half of america was cranking to my bottom .
i think you &apos;re trying to make up for what happened to you then
by putting on a perfect bowl show now .
spare me your amateur psychology .
&quot; ooh , i saw my father decapitated by a grain harvester
&quot; and now i can &apos;t enjoy wheat . boohoo . &quot;
mr. burns , i want you to listen to that crowd .
do you really want to let those happy , joyous people win ?
smithers , locate my dickey .
we &apos;ve got a show to do .
* i was gonna clean my room *
* until i got high *
* i was gonna get up and find the broom *
* but then ... *
springfield nuclear .
yes , yes , sir , i &apos;ll alert the workers ...
that the pizzas are here !
oh , yeah , here he comes .
the life of this party !
who wants to get back to work ?
what ?
we are a public trust .
we bring power to people &apos;s homes .
lightbulbs , toasters , and that &apos;s all i can think of .
now let &apos;s buckle down !
okay , homer , just let us get our microwave popcorn
out of the core .
you &apos;re only supposed to do that
when we &apos;re watching a movie in the core .
伯恩斯敬献 《 释放歌声 》
thank you , thank you .
well , that &apos;s the easiest time
anyone &apos;s had parking at the springfield bowl .
don &apos;t you laugh at me !
now , enjoy the show .
god always liked you best .
no , god loves everyone equally .
that &apos;s wonderful news .
enough of your tomfoolery , todd .
let &apos;s sing .
* michael , row your boat ashore *
* hallelujah *
* michael , row your boat ashore *
* hallelu ... *
say , sockie , who was that lady i saw you with last night ?
that was no lady .
that was your mother .
oh , she &apos;ll date anyone .
why won &apos;t she give me a stable home ?
um , this is just a simple twins trick .
they pulled the other twin out of the tank
behind the curtain .
wait , that wasn &apos;t part of the show .
no . no , it &apos;s not fair !
i was good !
arnold .
palmer !
fantastic .
what a finale , eh , mr. burns ?
childhood trauma cured , huh , huh ?
that wasn &apos;t the finale .
maestro , &quot; golden slippers , &quot; if you please .
ooh , boy .
we can &apos;t let him make a fool of himself again .
no , no , mr. burns needs to do this .
* oh , dem golden slippers *
* oh , dem gold ... *
the burn .
mr. burns can &apos;t take the impact of that many photons .
those light @-@ shining fools !
oh , for a murder of crows
to pluck out mine eyes !
you .
this show was your fault .
well , you &apos;d better know this , mister .
this town has my back .
and ... hey .
where did they go ?
how did 15,000 people leave so fast ?
want to see me do a cartwheel ?
always had trouble with those .
oh , i can &apos;t stay mad at you .
at my age , i can &apos;t stay anything at anybody .
oh , and you know what ?
the laughter in my head is gone .
go ahead , blow your german kazoo .
yes , sir !
smithers , tap my foot for me .
with impatience .
now , lift my arm so i can check my watch .
oh , you really should start doing
some of these things yourself .
dad , why do simpsons always fail ?
oh , sweetie pie ,
it &apos;s a terrible curse that goes back centuries .
no , no !
don &apos;t answer that .
we just need a place to stay for the night .
oh , shouldn &apos;t we help them ?
hey , in zero bc , you can &apos;t trust anybody .
curse them , mary !
you curse them , my water just broke !
please ?
you &apos;re telling me that really happened ?
they looked just like us , didn &apos;t they ?
