Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Lady, you sure this is the place?
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
This is my Bitcoin wallet address.
As soon as a transaction is confirmed, she'll be released.
As you know, the American government refuses
to negotiate with terrorists,
which is why the Palmer family contracted my firm
to negotiate on their behalf.
What is this?
My Bitcoin wallet address.
You don't pay the ransom, she dies.
You and I both know Miss Palmer isn't here, Karokaro.
You know it because you never had any intention
of giving her to me,
and I know it because I've already set her free.
Call your man at the port. You have a situation.
An hour ago, a strike team raided your holding site
at Muara Angke.
They took Miss Palmer,
along with the other eight workers you were holding,
so the kidnapping part of the story's over,
which leaves us with the business at hand.
You're not ransoming me. I'm ransoming you.
And the amount is $3 million, not $1 million.
I don't know if it bothers you telling people things
they don't want to hear,
but it makes me uncomfortable,
which is ironic because most people think I'm a bully.
They think I enjoy it, being blunt,
making people feel small,
but nothing could be further from the truth.
Years ago, I-I suffered an unspeakable loss.
And since then,
I've been crippled by free-floating anxieties
that attach to pretty much anything.
Some days I-I can't even get out of bed.
I haven't slept through the night in two years.
4 a.m., I'm up doing Sudoku.
Normally, I-I delegate a meeting like this
because, uh, conflict, it's debilitating.
But I'm working on the power of positive confrontation.
I-I haven't brushed up on my Indonesian in a while,
but I'm going to guess he's telling you
your brother's being held hostage by my people.
True.
If you want to see your brother alive again,
you're gonna transfer the money.
The number's $3 million.
Would you take cash?
Put it down.
Tom, I want to speak with you about your daughter.
What happened with Hargrave?
Even if you don't want me to have contact
with Elizabeth's child --
Hargrave. Did you get her?
I have virtually unlimited resources.
I want you to know that those resources
are at your disposal in the raising of Agnes.
I don't want your money. I don't want your protection.
I want answers.
The woman who killed Liz,
you walked right into her trap after I warned you.
What happened?
Alexander Kirk.
I don't know who that is.
The man who ordered the attack on your wedding.
He's ultimately responsible for Elizabeth's death.
I'm going to find him.
No, no, Susan Hargrave --
Was a contractor. A hired hand.
Tom, until I end this,
your only concern is to keep Agnes safe.
I'm gonna help you find him.
Absolutely not.
He'll come for her, for Agnes.
Yes.
I can't stand by and watch that happen.
You want me to accept your offer to help with Agnes,
then you need to accept my help with this.
So, tell me about Alexander Kirk.
Alexander Kirk is the alias of an oligarch
who made a fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union
buying mining operations for pennies on the dollar.
In 2002, he went into hiding
after falling out of favor with the Kremlin.
He owes his survival
to some of the world's most powerful politicians
whose careers he secretly bankrolls.
But Alexander Kirk is the man responsible for Elizabeth's death.
He hired Susan Hargrave to abduct her,
which is why we need to work with Hargrave to find him.
Work with her?
How about arrest her?
This sounds like a bad idea.
Until it's not.
The aid workers who were abducted in Jakarta?
Your government refused to pay the ransom,
turned its back on three young people
who were captured for doing nothing more
than providing medical services to the poor.
Today, they're home because Susan Hargrave committed
what your government considers to be a crime
in order to get them back.
She's a brilliant strategist.
And if we want to get Alexander Kirk,
we're going to need her help to do it.
His finances are the way in.
Kirk's holdings are out of reach.
The Caymans, Zurich.
They were out of reach until Citizens United.
Kirk has personally financed
a 501c4 super PAC
in support of Senator Robert Diaz's presidential bid.
How much?
It's hard to tell.
It's all dark money, but I believe it's north of $300 million.
Diaz is the front-runner.
If he gets elected,
Kirk's reach will extend into the White House.
I'm impressed.
Like I care.
If we steal Diaz's money, Kirk won't be far behind.
Him and everyone else.
It's a presidential campaign.
If that money goes missing,
everyone on the planet will take notice.
You make it sound so fun.
What about the husband, Tom Keen?
He thinks I'm responsible for the death of his wife.
I think you're responsible for her death.
I'm looking past that because I want Alexander Kirk's head.
And so does Tom Keen.
I must admit I've never liked you, Scottie.
Looking at you makes my toes curl.
But robbing the next President of the United States,
this is gonna be a gas.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby...
My, what a dear, sweet child.
How did you get in here?
With a seven-figure donation that built this wing.
The grasp of these tiny fingers.
I'd forgotten.
I understand we're gonna be working together
to find the man who took Elizabeth from you.
You took her from me.
No. Alexander Kirk did.
He's why I'm here,
to tell you I'm putting the full resources of my company
behind the effort to find Kirk and bring him to justice.
Give me my little girl.
She's all I care about.
I remember my little one looking up at me,
eyes full of wonder.
They say losing a child is something one never recovers from.
I hope you never experience that kind of loss.
For the moment, we have a common enemy, so...
I'll work with you.
You have a lovely child.
10 minutes. I'll send Solomon to pick you up.
Got a lot of work to do.
I hope you're a chocoholic, my friend.
We're going to the chocolate factory.
Let me say one thing. I'm not your friend.
What the hell is this place?
This is what happens when the government outsources 70%
of its intelligence budget.
You're 150 feet below the largest privately owned
tactical training center in the country,
complete with R&D labs,
ship-boarding simulators, and two airfields.
We do threat assessment, port security,
and diplomatic training,
and those are just the services that the public knows about --
the black-and-white divisions.
Then... there's Grey Matters.
Grey Matters handles the cases
that are legally questionable, yet morally justifiable.
You're late. She's not happy.
Promise you won't kick my ass.
'Cause she could kick my ass.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I thought I could, but I can't.
Remember, we're doing this for Elizabeth.
Yeah, but they're the same people who killed her.
You!
Navabi!
If I can do this, so can you.
Enough! We're on the clock.
Alexandre, j'essaie de vous protéger.
Sans autorisation formelle...
I don't need your protection.
After the U.S. election, approval will be a formality.
I just spoke to D.C.
We have a confirmed location of the child.
I want this done today.
The way to get Kirk's attention is through his money,
and the only money we can get to is sitting in Diaz's war chest,
which is unfortunate
for the bloviating senator from Missouri
because he cannot win the election without it,
and we're gonna steal it.
The Bureau prevents bank robberies. We don't commit them.
Senator Diaz's success in November
rests on winning three key swing states.
To do that, Futures America,
a PAC financed by Alexander Kirk,
intends to purchase over $300 million in TV ads
from now until election day.
The money is wired to media outlets via a secure terminal
from a single account at Key Atlantic Bank in Manhattan.
To get the money,
we need to access the terminal from the server room.
The good news is we can take the bank in under two minutes.
The bad news is the second we walk in,
any teller can trip a silent alarm
that will lock down the area of the bank
where the secure terminal is located.
So we won't be able to access it before the police arrive.
That's it? Your plan is awful.
It's brilliant. The robbery is a show.
You want the police to arrive, followed by the FBI.
The heist gets you in, gives you time to access the terminal --
We rob the bank while everyone else thinks
that we are trying to find the robbers.
Thanks, but no thanks.
You work with the single most sought-after criminal in America.
Thanks to you, he's not only free,
his criminal empire's expanding.
You, all of you, have proven quite capable
of parking your selective morality when the moment serves.
I suggest finding Elizabeth Keen's killer
is just such a moment.
It's "badges in the drawer" time, people.
This is a revenge movie.
Mr. Loescher, we sent out a foreclosure letter
three weeks ago.
No, I have the paperwork in my car.
Y-You never sent me a --
Just hold on. I can show you.
Sadie.
Sadie, don't move, okay? I'll be right back.
Hope you don't need my help in there
'cause you're not getting it.
Party time.
On the floor!
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are your friendly neighborhood bank robbers,
except we're not friendly,
and this sure as hell ain't our neighborhood.
I need everyone to slide their cellphones to the center of the room.
Come on.
Anyone wanting to know what happens
if you ignore my instructions, come speak to me directly.
It's okay. It's okay.
Just stay down. Stay down.
Daddy.
Yes, that's right. A robbery right now.
Key Atlantic Bank. My little girl's in there.
Call just came in to dispatch.
One Police Plaza Path responding.
Call's in. Start your clocks.
Key card and vault combination.
Silent alarm was just tripped.
Let's go.
Daddy.
It's gonna be okay, okay?
Put it down.
Don't be a hero, baby. 60 seconds, and we're ghosts.
NYPD. I said put your gun down.
No, no, no, no. You don't want to do this.
55 seconds.
Put down your gun!
No, you put your damn gun down!
It's just a flesh wound. You're gonna be fine.
Oh, my God, she's bleeding.
It hurts.
Okay, hold on.
Okay, we need a medic right now.
Patrol Response en route.
Ambulances will be dispatched as part of the response.
No, they won't enter until police secure the sight.
She can't wait that long.
40 seconds.
My wife is dead because of you.
I'm not gonna let this little girl die, too.
We got to clear, now.
30 seconds.
Responding units on site.
I need a paramedic.
Nearest unit is on Fulton and Pearl,
heading south.
That's too far.
My God, my little girl!
No, no, no!
Are you okay?
That's the father. Hold on, hold on.
Dad, with me. Now.
Okay.
We got to keep pressure on the wound.
All right.
All right?
Yeah.
All right.
Keep pressure on the wound. Can you do it?
Yeah.
This is a bad idea.
Give me the keys.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Paramedics approaching John Street.
What's her name?
Sadie.
All right, Sadie, just listen to your dad.
All right? Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you to a doctor,
and everything's gonna be just fine.
Hold on.
Where's my ambulance?
Pearl and Cedar, southbound.
I got her. That's alright.
Baby, you'll be okay. You'll be okay.
I got a gunshot, lower left abdomen.
In five!
Let's go.
Tell me you're not okay with this.
I wouldn't be if I had a better idea, but I don't.
Special Agents Ressler and Navabi.
First responders indicated that the robbers
knew exactly what they were looking for?
Yeah, it was a classified diplomatic pouch
owned by the Saudi government.
Do you have any security feeds?
Of course. Um, this way.
So, nothing else was taken?
Stupid, right?
You'd think they'd take something else to mislead us.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay, uh, the server room is across from the CFO's office,
second door from the end of the hall, right-hand side.
I see servers.
I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific than that.
Okay. Many servers.
Are any of them connected to a modem or a screen?
There's a keyboard.
Great. That's the server the terminal's connected to.
Follow the cable and insert, uh, you know, the, uh --
Your dongle?
Yes. Uh, well, it's not mine, but, uh, yeah.
Okay. Your dongle has been inserted.
Now we have remote access.
You're brute-forcing this thing?
Yeah, how else am I gonna generate
the bank president's password?
What, are you data-mining his social media?
You can't generate enough personal details
to create a useful password dictionary.
Classic.
Field gets the glory, support gets the job done.
Okay, as soon as I enter the password,
we should have access to the funds.
需要视网膜扫描
Or not. It's requesting a retinal scan.
Looks like we've got ourselves a two-key system.
Tasty.
What happened?!
Hey! Hold up! Stop!
Where is she? Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?!
Sir, you're not allowed to go in there.
We take three types of contributions --
big, dark, and anonymous.
Which if he loses, also describes Senator Diaz.
I'm screwing with you, Robert. Come on.
We're supposed to be having fun here tonight,
and raising money for the next President of the United States,
Senator Robert Diaz.
Thank you.
Oh, well, thank you, Scottie.
I know I speak for everyone here when I say,
good God, I wish Howard had given that introduction.
Well, I understand he's off working on, well...
Mrs. Hargrave thinks you may be more comfortable
if I knew what it was, you'd have to kill me.
waiting in her office.
What the hell is wrong with you?
My daughter -- where is she? - Showing up uninvited.
Do you have any idea who some of those people are?
I don't care! They said you took her!
Tonight is important to me.
A nurse is dead,
a 7-year-old girl was shot in the robbery.
Sadie Loescher,
a second grader at PS-126,
is resting comfortably in a private room at Mount Sinai
thanks to the work of a renowned vascular surgeon
whose schedule miraculously cleared up in time
to remove six bullet fragments lodged in her sacrum.
If you're thinking of sending flowers, don't -- she's allergic.
But she loves dark chocolate.
What did you do with my little girl, huh?
My people received word Kirk was on the move.
I alerted the FBI, and because of it, more people weren't hurt.
Your daughter is safe,
and she's getting the medical attention she needs.
Now, if you're finished,
the next President of the United States
is waiting downstairs for me.
Robbing Key Atlantic got us
the first of two authentications we need to access Kirk's funds.
Peter Pruitt is the second.
As president of Airborne Fidelity,
Pruitt manages assets worth over $4 billion
belonging to fugitives like Alexander Kirk.
He's also treasurer of Futures America.
Ah, so he's the good old boy
that funnels Kirk's millions into the PAC.
Yes, and no withdrawals over $250,000 can be made
without a biometric scan of his eyes.
Pruitt's in Berlin staying at the Turkish Embassy
as a guest of the Ambassador.
He'll attend a reception at the embassy for the G8 ministers.
We need a biometric scan of Pruitt's eyes,
which are in that embassy.
Getting in during the G8 summit means
getting past an A-list security system and a small army.
Good luck with that.
Eugene Pavlenko.
I don't know who that is.
Me.
Pavlenko is a fugitive wanted in Turkey
on money-laundering charges.
When the ID gets flagged by INTERPOL,
it will require my provisional arrest.
Once that happens, officials in Ankara
will immediately insist that I am transported to --
To the Turkish Embassy.
Where they will file a formal request for extradition.
柏林
Even if they do take you into the embassy,
you'll never get a retinal scanner inside.
I'm not bringing a scanner in.
I'm bringing Pruitt out.
How?
I'm gonna poison him.
Dumont, sending you feeds from the embassy security.
Capturing video now, creating a loop and uploading.
Guards should be blind in five, four...
All clear.
♬Papa was a rolling stone♬
Smokes, key card.
♬Wherever he laid his hat was his home♬
When you exit, make two lefts,
and the first door on your right should be a stairwell
♬And when he died, all he left us was alone♬
that takes you to a third floor.
Almost there.
♬Oh, oh, papa was a rolling stone♬
You got two swallows overhead.
♬My son, yeah♬
♬Wherever he laid his hat was his home♬
On you in four, three, two...
♬And when he died, all he left us was alone♬
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
The kitchen will give you access to the ballroom via the south door.
Champagne?
Danke.
He's the mark. Why are you walking away?
I have to tell you.
That is just the most amazing tie.
What the hell is wrong with you, you clumsy idiot?!
Look, do we -- I...
Can you talk to somebody
about getting me another shirt, will you?
Okay.
Jesus.
Scotch.
Let me help you, sir.
You speak English?
Okay, we got a situation.
You've got to get out of there now.
My father was American.
Two packs a day, unfiltered.
Got to be careful. Those things can kill you.
So can mouthing off at guests.
Know your place, kid.
They know. You need to get out.
Now.
What is this?
Told you those things would kill you.
Time to go to work.
Just hold him still so I can get a scan.
Maybe if you dosed him properly.
I was trying to put him to sleep,
not kill the poor bastard. Just hold him still.
You have Landespolizei units approaching to your south.
Proceed to Wilhelmstrasse and switch to frequency 126.420.
Okay, I'm transmitting the scan now.
需要视网膜扫描
Do it again.
I can't do it again. They got a lockout protocol in place.
Yes, Agent Mojtabai speaking.
The retinal scan's being rejected
because of your connection, cheesecake.
Get ready, kids. We've been spotted.
We need to dump this vehicle.
Uh, Dumont, uh, I think I figured it out.
Aram!
Tom, hey. How cool is this?
I didn't expect to talk to you until Agnes' baptism.
Bless me, Father, for we need to get on with it.
Guys!
Right. Uh, sorry.
They said you, uh, drugged Pruitt?
Yeah, 200 micrograms of fentanyl.
Exactly, an opiate narcotic will cause the pupils
to be constricted to pinpoint size, and the scanner --
Retinal scanner requires light to analyze the back of the eye.
If not enough light passes into the constricted pupils --
The scanner's unable to detect the retinal signature.
Okay, the bad news -- I just dosed him again.
I don't even know if he's got pupils right now.
But if we wait
Waiting isn't an option.
We need to counteract the meds.
How do we do that?
Tropicamide.
It's what eye doctors use to dilate your pupils.
6-3, we're taking a detour.
Tropicamide. Got it.
This one's on you, kid.
We're only in this situation because --
We are in this situation because you attacked my wedding.
You're right.
But you and I both know that your wife is in a much better place.
That's for my wife.
Drive!
Where's Solomon?
I said drive!
Aram. Get Keen on the line.
Little busy right now.
Just got off the phone with FinCEN.
Key Atlantic's been notified of Pruitt's abduction,
and the bank president's on his way there now.
He's gonna freeze the account, lock us out.
I don't have the scan yet.
Well, get it. He's gonna be there any minute.
I got Dumont on the line.
Yeah, let me guess. The bank president's on his way.
According to the security
feeds in the building, he's already there.
You got less than a minute to get that money, honey.
All right! All right! I'm doing it.
Uploading now.
Are you getting it?
Dumont?
He's trying to lock us out.
Dumont!
Got it. We're in.
Starting the transfer.
Kirk's money is on its way.
As soon as the scans verify, the funds are ours.
It's gonna be close, sweet cheeks.
Reddington. It's time.
Get Pruitt on the phone.
Yes, I know he was attacked.
By the people who took our money!
Hello, Robert.
Tough day.
Scottie?
You heard about the money.
Please, please tell me you know what happened.
Oh, I know exactly what happened. I took it.
You did?
You wrote me a $50,000 check.
You have to give to get.
I gave, now I got.
Well, technically, we got.
Senator!
Having taken your money, I won't take much of your time.
Unlike Scottie, I have little use for politicians
and even less for their politics.
Who occupies the White House is of no interest to me.
I tell you this so you know that taking your money
has nothing to do with you or what you stand for.
Truth be told, I haven't the foggiest clue
what you stand for, Senator.
I'm calling the police.
Might be more prudent to call Alexander Kirk.
I'm sure you have a contributor of his stature on speed dial.
Call him.
Senator Diaz.
Senator, what a pleasure.
I have your money.
I have your senator.
Do you know what I'm thinking, Raymond?
That house by the water,
holding a gun in your mouth
I should have pulled the trigger.
So, you have my money and my senator.
You don't have me.
Look, I did what you asked. Just...
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna hold a press conference
to announce you're taking a moment away from the campaign trail
to compel billionaire Alexander Kirk
to testify about some of his business activities
before the Congressional committee you chair.
Why are you doing this?
Oh, spare us the moral outrage, Bob.
We're doing you a favor.
If you get Kirk here, Reddington can have him.
Once he has him, you get your illegal money back,
laundered through anonymous contributions
made to the PAC of your choice.
I am not gonna be an accomplice to murder.
You are if you want to be President.
I know, the christening. We're coming.
No, no. No, no, no.
I mean... yes totally, but.
Diaz. He subpoenaed Kirk.
He is forcing him to come to D.C.
We're gonna get him.
Reddington must have got his hands on Kirk's money.
He's gonna use it against him.
When this started, Kirk was the criminal
who was going to be controlling the next President.
Now it's Reddington.
Oh, look at her.
She is so beautiful.
And that little dress.
You know, Liz and I never really had a family
♬They didn't have you where I come from♬
until we met you guys.
Albeit a slightly dysfunctional family,
the kind where you try to kill each other occasionally.
♬Never knew the best was yet to come♬
But a family nonetheless.
This year especially.
You guys really came together for...
♬Life began when I saw your face♬
...for Liz.
Just like I know you would for Agnes.
♬And I hear your laugh like a serenade♬
So, it didn't take a genius to decide
who Liz would want to godparent our little girl.
♬How long♬
She'd want all of you.
♬Do you want to be loved♬♬
♬Is forever enough♬♬
♬Is forever enough♬♬
♬How long do you want to be loved♬♬
♬Is forever enough♬♬
♬'Cause I'm never, never giving you up♬
Mrs. Hargrave's not here.
I'll wait.
Yeah.
Don't do it.
There's nothing left to do.
Tom.
We needed the money to get to Kirk.
We got it. We have no use for her anymore.
If you kill her, the answers you've been looking for
your entire life will die with her.
What are you talking about?
I remember my little one
looking up at me, eyes full of wonder.
My mother.
Yes.
Which is why I didn't want you involved.
Why didn't you tell me?
You have a child to raise, Tom.
If you start asking questions,
it will put her at risk, it will put you at risk.
But her son is dead. She told me that herself.
Christopher Hargrave went missing
when he was only 3 years old.
Christopher...Hargrave. Is that my name?
Susan Hargrave genuinely believes her son is dead.
So, she has no idea who I am?
What, did somebody fake my death...
and hide me from her all these years?
W-why would anybody do that?
Listen to me, Tom.
Susan Hargrave has many secrets.
Some of them concern you.
If you want answers,
you must conceal your true identity.
My perfect baby boy.
He loved the water.
Found that necklace in a trinket shop
during a trip to Ocean City.
We had rented a house that summer,
spent the whole week on the beach building sand castles
with drawbridges and moats.
That night, Howard and I had a... big fight.
Too much to drink.
Next morning, Christopher was gone.
The police searched everywhere, but...
nothing. He was just... gone.
Like his castle.
It's been 28 years,
and not a day goes by where I don't walk into a room...
hoping, praying he'll be there.
Please tell me you're not gonna try and kill me again.
That's exactly what I came here to do.
But for my daughter's sake, I'm not gonna do that.
You're hired.
Sorry, what?
You want me to work for you?
In my experience,
there's a very fine line between love and hate.
We could do incredible things together.
I'm sorry about your son.
