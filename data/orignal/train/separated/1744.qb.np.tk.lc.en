gentlemen , star wars day is rapidly approaching .
we should finalize our plans .
what ? that &apos;s a real thing ?
what is it , star wars christmas ?
no . don &apos;t be ridiculous .
that &apos;s wookiee life day .
so , when is it ?
uh , well , it &apos;s not may the fifth ...
and it &apos;s not may the third ...
it &apos;s may the fourth .
get it ?
may the fourth be with you ?
&quot; may the force be with you . &quot; get it ?
oh , no . this face wasn &apos;t because i didn &apos;t get it .
come in .
hey , you got a second ?
yes .
actually , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i @-@ i &apos;m working on the star wars day schedule .
now , i have a window built in after phantom menace ,
for complaining , but ...
i &apos;m worried an hour won &apos;t be enough time .
sheldon , i @-@ i &apos;ve got some bad news .
what is it ?
i just read online
that arthur jeffries passed away .
professor proton is dead ?
sorry , buddy .
what are you doing ?
comforting you ?
y @-@ your heart might be in the right place ,
but your head , chest and arms certainly aren &apos;t .
anyway , the @-@ the funeral &apos;s on sunday .
but , that &apos;s star wars day .
yeah ... um ...
of all the things about this that are sad ,
that might not be number one .
you okay ? i know he meant a lot to you .
i &apos;m fine .
okay .
yet he cried when they changed the raisin bran box .
this , uh , this is something interesting boys and girls .
after an owl eats , he spits up part of his meal ,
that he can &apos;t digest , in the form of a pellet .
is @-@ isn &apos;t that a hoot ?
we &apos;ll be right back after i fire my writers .
oh , shut up .
watching your old friend ?
yes .
look at him , amy .
it &apos;s such a shame .
struck down in the prime of my life .
do you want me to go to the funeral with you ?
oh , i &apos;m not going to the funeral .
why not ?
all those people blowing their noses .
you can &apos;t tell the sick from the sad . mm .
i &apos;ll be at home celebrating star wars day , as planned .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to go say good @-@ bye ?
amy , mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time .
and watching a bunch of goofy space movies
you &apos;ve seen hundreds of times isn &apos;t ?
if we were in a physical relationship ,
you just lost sex tonight .
hey , guys .
hey , penny . happy star wars day .
okay .
can i make you breakfast ?
admiral ackbar &apos;s snack bar is open for business .
no , thanks . leonard and i are just going to the funeral .
you sure . not even coffee ?
we have r2 @-@ decaf .
maybe a nice cafe au leia ?
莉亚 星球大战中的一位人类公主
and if you &apos;re not in the mood for coffee ,
i can always make you a chai tea @-@ 3po .
oh , i get it-- like c @-@ 3po .
what happened to me ?
hey , uh , sheldon , you want anything ?
uh , no , thank you .
you &apos;re being so quiet .
are you upset or are you just rebooting ?
i &apos;m fine .
sweetie , are you sure you don &apos;t want to
come with us to the funeral ?
oh , i appreciate the offer , but arthur is gone
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
when darth vader struck down obi @-@ wan ,
did luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral ?
no .
he blew up the death star .
why do i know this ? !
arthur jeffries was a scientist .
i &apos;m sure he didn &apos;t care about
silly superstitions like funerals .
you know , if he were here , i think he &apos;d say ,
&quot; enjoy star wars day . &quot;
he was 84 ; he &apos;d say , &quot; where &apos;s my pudding ? &quot;
before you go , at least let me pack you some
attack of the scones for the road .
oh , like attack of the clones .
we are leaving right now .
arthur passing away was harder on sheldon
than he &apos;s ready to admit .
really hoping this will cheer him up .
me , too .
although , it might &apos;ve been thoughtless of us
to bake a death star cake .
no , it combines two of sheldon &apos;s favorite things :
chocolate chips
and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button .
well , anyway , it &apos;ll be a nice surprise for the boys .
and howie doesn &apos;t think i take his interests seriously ,
so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while .
okay , let &apos;s get the fondant and start decorating .
this is pretty cool .
you don &apos;t see too many spherical cakes .
i wonder why that is .
i have a confession to make .
i &apos;ve never been to a funeral before .
really ?
i just never knew anyone that died .
i had a pet pig when i was a kid .
i mean , when he died , we didn &apos;t have a funeral ,
we had a barbecue .
yeah , we won &apos;t be eating arthur tonight .
i didn &apos;t know him very well , but i still really liked him .
it &apos;s weird that he &apos;s ... just gone .
i know .
i feel like i want to cry .
oh ... that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s fine .
go ahead .
i can &apos;t do it with you staring at me .
sorry .
no , i &apos;m dry .
you &apos;re a big crybaby-- you start , i &apos;ll join in .
i am not a crybaby .
toy story 3 ?
the toys were holding hands in a furnace !
look , a @-@ arthur lived a full life .
and he inspired a lot of people .
sure , he @-@ he was my childhood hero ,
but ... the fact that i got to work with him ,
side by side , before he ...
died was ...
it was ... it was a gift .
it was a gift .
thank you for being the emotional one
in this relationship .
i got your back .
yeah .
okay , here we go .
episode i-- the phantom menace .
let &apos;s get this over with .
since we all agree episode i isn &apos;t our favorite ,
maybe we just skip it this time .
yeah , howard , i think you of all people
should avoid espousing the principle
that if something is not our favorite
we should just get rid of it .
you know , i heard this way of watching the movies
called the machete order , where you watch episodes iv and v ,
then skip episode i ,
watch ii and iii as a flashback ,
and then finish with vi .
okay , so you &apos;d lose most of jar jar ,
all the trade route talk , and the boring senate hearings ,
which are like watching c @-@ span with monsters .
get rid of the trade route part ?
then how would palpatine
get chancellor valorum kicked out of office ?
how would he get himself elected ? how ?
can we get through one holiday
without you saying something ridiculous ?
it was just a suggestion .
well , you know what else was just a suggestion ?
&quot; why don &apos;t we change the raisin bran box ? &quot;
hmm ? and you know who got hurt by that ?
every single person who eats breakfast !
i think he &apos;s taking this professor proton thing pretty hard .
should we try to console him ?
or ... should we respect his privacy
in this moment of grief ?
by staying here and watching the movie .
that &apos;s what good friends would do !
well , at least without sheldon here ,
we got to start with episode iv .
mm , true .
i do feel guilty about him .
me , too .
maybe we should see how he &apos;s doing .
yeah .
but after the cantina scene .
obviously .
look at arthur ...
cracking up at a joke i told him .
i &apos;ll never hear that laugh again .
you never heard it that time .
arthur !
i thought you were dead .
i am .
oh , it @-@ it &apos;s fantastic .
i mean , this is the longest that i &apos;ve gone
without running into a men &apos;s room in @-@ in years .
why are you here ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i was ...
i was hoping i was going to haunt my ex @-@ wife .
i know why .
you &apos;ve come to me because
you &apos;re my obi @-@ wan .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not familiar with that .
is ... is @-@ is that an ...
an internet ?
wow .
uh , you &apos;re dead , so i &apos;m going to let that slide .
obi @-@ wan kenobi is a character from star wars .
after his physical demise ,
he comes to luke skywalker as his mentor in spirit form .
well , that ... that clears that up .
you must be here to give me advice .
well , this ... this is weird .
most @-@ most of my robes open in ...
in the back .
those are your jedi robes .
oh , wait . what ... ?
what @-@ what ... what is this ?
oh ! be careful with that !
oh , neato .
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m going to need a band @-@ aid .
so ... what did you think of your first funeral ?
well , i don &apos;t want to be a jerk , but it was kind of a bummer .
yeah , well , when i die , you can rent a bounce house .
you think about dying ?
well , i think more about if i &apos;d have any regrets .
what would you regret ?
mm , you know , that i didn &apos;t travel more ,
take more risks , learn another language .
you know klingon .
that &apos;s true .
no , i meant that as a regret .
i just thought of one more .
what &apos;s that ?
i regret not saying &quot; yes &quot; when you asked me to marry you .
well , it just wasn &apos;t the right time .
yeah .
and this is also not the right time .
do not propose .
what ?
i know that face . that &apos;s your propose face .
i was not gonna propose . it &apos;s already two to one .
what &apos;s two to one ?
i proposed twice , you proposed once . two to one .
oh , my ... it &apos;s not a contest .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re upset about .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s losing .
okay .
fine . would you feel better if i propose
so you could turn me down again ?
yeah , i think i would .
okay . leonard , will you marry me ?
no , don &apos;t you dare .
you reject me right now and tie things up .
it &apos;s just such a big decision .
i don &apos;t want to have any regrets .
did you ever watch professor proton when you were a kid ?
no .
my dad controlled the tv ,
so unless someone was a texas ranger ,
jake or the fatman , we didn &apos;t see it .
i never watched him , either , but he seems to be the reason
that sheldon got interested in science .
not me . i got into science
&apos;cause i was always the smallest kid in school ,
so i thought if i became a scientist ,
i could invent a formula that made me taller .
that &apos;s cute .
yeah , i thought it was working for a while ,
but then i found out my brother was just
lowering the pencil marks on the door frame .
how about you ?
oh , i guess it must have been back when i was in the girl sprouts .
girl sprouts ?
my mom made it up as an alternative to the girl scouts .
she didn &apos;t want me selling cookies
on some street corner &quot; like a whore . &quot;
how did that get you into science ?
oh , i went to the library
and took out a book on biology to see what whores did .
on the one hand , if i say yes ...
this isn &apos;t funny anymore .
just say no so we &apos;re done with this .
will you marry me or not ?
ooh , interesting . did you just propose to me again ?
no .
really ?
because i just heard , &quot; will you marry me ? &quot;
that &apos;s two proposals , one day .
sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life
telling people how to spell the name hofstadter .
you know what ? fine . do whatever you want .
penny , don &apos;t get upset .
here .
i love you , but , no , i will not marry you .
thank you .
now , about that second proposal .
on the one hand ...
where ... where ... where are we ?
this is the swampland of dagobah .
it &apos;s where luke was trained in the ways of the jedi .
too bad . i thought it was florida .
when obi @-@ wan came to luke on this very spot ,
he gave him all sorts of helpful advice .
so , um ...
what do you got for me ?
always ...
get ... get a prenup .
that &apos;s it ?
i thought there &apos;d be more of a reason why you &apos;re here .
well , why @-@ why do you think i &apos;m here ?
i suppose it has something to do with your recent passing .
is @-@ is this the ... the first time
you &apos;ve lost , you know , someone close to you ?
oh , no . no .
i &apos;ve already had to say good @-@ bye to 11 dr. whos .
yeah , i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve outlived a few of my doctors , too .
of course , my grandfather died when i was five .
my father died when i was 14 .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry about that .
and now you &apos;re gone , too .
it &apos;s like all the men i &apos;ve looked up to have gone away .
well , you know , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s okay to ... to be sad about them .
just ... just make sure , you know , you appreciate
those who ... who are still there for you .
but i do appreciate them .
well , then ,
what am i doing in a swamp ...
... dressed like friar tuck ?
appreciate them , sheldon .
hey , buddy .
heard you &apos;re having a rough day . you all right ?
i &apos;m okay .
how was the funeral ?
it was nice , you know .
a lot of people showed up ,
told some great stories about him .
did you know that arthur &apos;s son is a high school sci ... ?
hey , the guys are about to start jedi .
you want to go watch ?
i do .
after i make them go back and watch one through five first .
sheldon , that @-@ that &apos;ll take us all night .
that &apos;s true .
oh , it &apos;s a good thing i had a nap .
boy , some of the physical comedy
with jar jar is a little tough to watch .
at least they toned him down in the second one .
yeah , he is pretty stupid .
hey , we can say it . you can &apos;t .
hey , guys .
happy star wars day !
a death star cake !
yeah .
we were hoping it might cheer you up .
and even though it meant we had to miss the movies ,
we could still be part of the fun .
well , you didn &apos;t miss anything .
we just started over .
son of a bitch .
you &apos;re back .
yeah , apparently , um ,
i &apos;m here whenever ... when @-@ whenever you need me .
that &apos;s nice .
may @-@ maybe for you .
why do i need you now ?
well , as near as i could tell ,
you @-@ you fell asleep watching star wars ,
and now you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re dreaming you &apos;re watching star wars .
so ?
i mean , don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t you see a problem there ?
i mean , how @-@ how
you &apos;re spending your limited time on earth ?
not at all .
okay , good luck to you .
