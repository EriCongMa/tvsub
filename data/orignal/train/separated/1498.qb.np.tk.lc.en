and you &apos;re not coming , so ...
mitchell .
oh , look at us moving on .
it &apos;s almost like you never dumped me in an e @-@ mail
the morning after i told you that i loved you .
well , y-- in my defense , e @-@ mail --
it was new back then ...
... and it was still a blurry line
as to what was appropriate and ...
well , we have a pretty packed weekend .
oh , we do , but if you guys have some time ,
here &apos;s our itinerary .
okay .
come play .
oh , yeah .
fun . bye .
you guys , congratulations .
thank you .
oh , my gosh ,
an actual gay agenda .
looks like we &apos;re not gonna see much of you two this trip .
no .
no , no .
we are not participating in any of this .
they &apos;re very judgy about bachelor parties .
i offered to throw them one ,
and i got a whole lecture .
we &apos;re 40 . we have a child .
we &apos;ve been together for 10 years .
that &apos;s the one .
it &apos;s just not who we are anymore .

we will be maintaining our dignity in the spa , thank you .
i mean , come on ,
have you ever seen a scottish person this tan ?
i &apos;m embarrassed even looking at it .
then stop .
whoa , that warmer drawer really works .
it &apos;s like my mom &apos;s hugging my feet again .
i &apos;m gonna go do some shopping .
oh , well , maybe we &apos;ll catch up later .
no , you have your day ,
i &apos;ll have mine .
well , how &apos; bout the bar at like 5 : 00 ?
sure .
she was icing me ,
but i deserved it .
for the first time in my whole life ,
i was neglecting her .
i &apos;d been invited to audition
for a secret magic society in las vegas ,
but in all my rehearsals ,
i &apos;d paid no attention to claire .
i even left her alone in a movie theater once .
oh , no .
i let phil think i was still mad at him
because i needed a little time to myself .
come to mama ! yeah !
years ago , phil and i put aside money
for a trip on our 25th anniversary ,
but i lost that money on
a girls &apos; weekend in vegas .
since then , i &apos;ve been on a secret mission
to win that money back ,
and if things go well this weekend ,
i am even .
vegas , you have a gambling problem ,
and her name is claire .
knockity @-@ knock @-@ knock .
mr. dunphy , i presume ?
yes . who-- hi .
i &apos;m leslie higgins
it &apos;s a boy &apos;s name where i &apos;m from .
i &apos;m your butler .
oh . butler . cool .
yes . as an excelsior guest ,
uh , i &apos;m at your beck and call 24 / 7 .
anything you need , big or small , i can
can i just segue , sir ,
to the importance of discretion in my job ?
i &apos;ll just pop those --
oh , no , no , no . never mind those .
as you wish .
they &apos;re for an appointment i have later .
the less you know about that , the better .
a myriad of apologies , sir .
if there &apos;s nothing else ...
oh , hang on .
actually , do you know where i can get a cape laundered ?
opera or superhero ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
i overstepped the mark by asking .
uh , could i just , uh , quickly point out
our luxury bath service , sir ?
we have five outrageously decadent baths
that i can prepare for you at a moment &apos;s notice .
uh , i should just point out , though ,
that our pharaoh &apos;s fantasy does take a dash longer ,
normally , because our nubian lives off @-@ site .
um ... if there &apos;s nothing else ,
i &apos;ll just help you with your case .
uh , no , uh --
i &apos;ll get that .
yeah .
all right . thank you .
i love cucumber water .
i know .
if i were president
i know , i know .
cucumbers in the reservoirs .
giant cucumbers .
mr. pritchett ?
yes , hi .
all right , i &apos;ll see you in 90 minutes .
enjoy .
thank you .
mr. tucker ?
mr. tucker ?
we had a few no @-@ shows for the britney concert , so ...
one , please .
uh , what about mitchell ?
it &apos;s vegas -- he doesn &apos;t need to know what i &apos;m doing .
i don &apos;t need to know what he &apos;s doing .
so if you see him ,
maybe don &apos;t mention what i &apos;m doing .
oh . understood .
so , do you have anything on the aisle ?
yeah ?
rasputin &apos;s dalmatian drowned in the volga .
i thought he was allergic to dogs .
you &apos;re thinking of merlin .
and it was peanuts .
okay , everybody .
we have a visitor .
welcome phil dunphy .
hey , phil .
hey . i &apos;m so honored to be here .
you may recognize my -- my screen name ,
abracadunphy17 .
that &apos;s you ?
you &apos;re up in the middle of the night a lot .
my wife grinds her teeth .
but let me tell you another story .
it &apos;s about the miracle of metamorphosis .
uh , phil - they say the only constant is change --
phil , we &apos;re gonna get to your trick in just a minute .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
got a little excited there .
the heroes of the underground @-@ magic blogosphere --
&quot; flashpaper &quot; finelli , kaiser mayhem , the kid .
when you think about it ,
it &apos;s crazy they &apos;re all alive at the same time .
jay , i &apos;m feeling a little cold .
maybe i should buy a scarf .
sure , get a couple of &apos; em .
why , i know it &apos;s a little extravagant ,
but we &apos;re excelsior now --
might as well look it .
many years ago , when jay was in las vegas ,
he bought barkley ,
the doggy butler .
i hate barkley .
i knew if jay saw rebarka ,
he would want her too .
yeah , that &apos;s her name -- rebarka .
uh , but , uh -- you know ,
if we &apos;re going to gamble ,
maybe i need my lucky sweater .
can you go and get it in the room ?
who has a lucky sweater ?
you wore two different shoes to watch the super bowl .
fine .
no , jay !
other way .
i like that way .
sorry , sir . this is a private elevator .
no need to apologize .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re on top of this stuff .
that &apos;s only for the excelsior level .
this elevator goes to the top floor .
i thought excelsior was the top -- 62 .
mandalay bay has 63 floors .
top floor is excelsior plus .
wait , they &apos;re allowed up there ?
they &apos;re wearing dungarees .
61 , 62 ... 63 !
son of a bitch !
come on , let me see an eight .
i want to see an eight .
seven out .
sorry .
we &apos;ll get &apos; em next time , baby .
claire . give me your key .
i need to charge something to your room .
hang on a second .
four . point is four .
okay , odds on four and a five each on &quot; c &quot; and &quot; e. &quot;
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s the lady version of barkley .
i have to put it on hold
so that jay , if he sees it , he can &apos;t buy it ,
and then i will cancel the charge before we leave .
winner-- four the hard way !
oh , yes ! finally !
can i have the key ?
oh , no , honey . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
you &apos;re my good @-@ luck charm .
give these a blow , beautiful .
and how was your massage ?
so re--
so , so relaxing .
sorry , my masseuse was blasting the enya .
so , what are you gonna do next ?
a long soak ?
a long sauna ?
i think a sauna .
yeah , i think i &apos;m gonna do a soak .
ooh , a soak does sound nice .
maybe i &apos;ll do a sauna .
is that-- is that glitter on your face ?
yeah , i think my masseuse might moonlight .
vegas .
all right , i &apos;ll see you in an hour .
okay . yeah .
enjoy it . really have fun .
relax , mitchell .
phil , you &apos;re up .
okay .
the miracle ... of metamorphosis .
they say the only constant is change .
well , all of that is about to ch-- be different .
note the simple burlap sack ,
the kind you &apos;d find in any home .
if you &apos;d be so kind as to assist me ,
the-- the-- the kid ,
i &apos;ll endeavor to prove that some change is glacial ,
while some change is instantaneous .
now , if you &apos;d be so kind as to raise the simple burlap sack
above my head and pinch my wrists .
you &apos;ll note , the clock says exactly 4 : 02 .
i have 3 : 15 .
yeah , i have 6 : 35 .
kaiser mayhem !
it &apos;s what i do .
wait , it &apos;s 5 : 20 ?
i actually have to call my wife .
oh , no , phil , you can &apos;t just stop in the middle of a trick .
that &apos;s a cardinal rule .
guys , it &apos;s an emergency .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never
had to call your spouse .
oh ... there &apos;s-- there &apos;s people for you .
come on , claire . please pick up .
and the lady wins again .
yes ! yes !
i did it ! i did it !
i did it ! i won back my money .
oh , suck it , the house .
claire , the key .
yeah , okay , here you go .
and , hey , buy yourself something sparkly .
gloria , there &apos;s a floor above us .
what ? !
i know . it threw me , too .
excelsior plus .
but to the people on that floor ,
we &apos;re excelsior minus .
mm , what is up there ?
you need a black card to get in .
all we &apos;ve got is this stupid silver one .
oh , i thought it was platinum .
it &apos;s crap .
uh , why-
why don &apos;t you call your friend burt
and tell him that we need the black card ?
because he &apos;s not my friend .
i never really even met him .
i think i heard him cough one time on a conference call .
i don &apos;t know why he would treat me this way .
oh , come on !
what ?
oh , come on ! you &apos;re jay pritchett !
you &apos;re gonna find your friend burt
and tell him who you are ,
and you &apos;re gonna get the black card ,
because when you set your mind on something ,
nobody can stop you !
right !
wait !
go that way .
excuse me ,
how much is that doggy in the window ?
i had finally taken back from vegas what vegas took from me .
that &apos;s a feeling of satisfaction i can &apos;t describe ...
because it didn &apos;t last very long .
oh , hey , claire .
yeah ?
have you seen cam ?
no .
although ... we should stay in one place so he can find us .
how about a blackjack table ?
oh , no , i &apos;m really worn out from my massage , the sauna ...
it was just-- it was a lot of detoxing .
you know what you need ?
some toxing .
no .
hand of blackjack , couple of tequilas .
come on , it &apos;ll be fun . do it .
you sound just like the kid who bullied me
into smoking my first cigarette .
maybe this time you won &apos;t tell on me .
and then hit .
yes .
and then hit . and then stay .
i know . i have it .
okay .
18 , 19 , 18 .
you are in a great position right now .
oh , the dealer has 21 .
hers is better .
i am so sorry , mitchell .
i promise you , we did everything right .
don &apos;t be mad .
i &apos;m not mad .
really ?
t @-@ that was -- that was thrilling . i &apos;m ...
my pulse is racing .
yeah . yeah . yeah .
thank you so much for making me do this .
yeah .
i &apos;m going to play another hand .
we &apos;re going to play another hand .
no , alone .
not with you . you &apos;re bad luck .
really ?
go -- far .
the minute i got rid of her ,
i couldn &apos;t lose .
oh , gambling &apos;s fun .
and easy .
hey , big spender .
what are you doing ?
gambling . i &apos;m a gambler now .
look at you , letting loose .
yeah .
yeah , i guess i figure
whatever mischief one might get into in vegas
kind of remains here within the limits of the city , you know ?
that &apos;s a cool way to think about it .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;m really glad that you came over here .
really ? why is that ?
well , i always hated the way
that things ended between us , you know ?
maybe now we can go out on a better note .
that &apos;s nice .
yeah .
oh -- oh , my god !
6 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s my room number .
huh . um , hit me .
seven !
that &apos;s 21 , huh ?
yes ! yeah ! ah !
whoa , check you out .
i guess tonight &apos;s my night to get lucky .
i would say .
here you are .
thank you .
maybe i will run into you again , huh ?
okay .
oh , you ...
there are $ 2140 , higgins ,
for nothing -- nothing !
i want to do something crazy .
okay , i &apos;m gonna order a bath .
sir , it seems to me like you &apos;ve gone mad .
okay , this is what i want .
i want something romantic ,
but also a little dangerous .
romantic , dangerous --
might i suggest , sir , the techno bath ?
your heart will throb with the bass
while your eyes take in an off @-@ the @-@ scale laser light show
from that most intimate of v.i.p. arenas
- your own tub .
okay . i want that .
that &apos;s what i want .
me thinks the little red riding hood may be a big , bad wolf .
i &apos;ll be back shortly with supplies .
okay !
ah , mr. dunphy ! how are ...
... we this evening ?
not so good .
i &apos;m in a tight spot with my lady .
you know what might help ?
one of those -- one of those luxury baths .
ah , get yourself out of some hot water
by getting her into some .
wow , so good .
might i suggest the michael buble bath ?
you are a mind reader .
i &apos;m not a mind reader , sir .
i &apos;ve just been in the bath @-@ buttling business
since the early &apos; 90s ,
despite my fresh face .
so i tend to know what these situations need .
i &apos;ll get the water going .
as you wish .
same price either way .
burt says he &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
we got to really lay it on for this guy --
best scotch , put on something sexy .
i ... have a great idea !
cigars !
a man like burt appreciates a good cigar .
good thinking !
of course , upstairs , the butler would be here already .
i &apos;m telling you ,
we might as well be sleeping in the basement .
i said hold it , not deliver it !
okay , there .
come here .
stay in claire &apos;s room .
hey , honey . i &apos;m in the bathroom .
honey ?
okay , i @-@ i know i messed up ,
but sit tight -- i got a little surprise for you .
higgins , you got a minute ?
60 an hour .
they all belong to you , sir .
i need a couple of primo cigars , a.s.a.p.
i &apos;m not a stickler for how they got in the country .
i &apos;m also expecting a special scotch delivery .
i need a shave .
burt can &apos;t see me like this .
unfortunately , the shaving butlers are all --
i know , excelsior plus .
are you decent ?
i am .
well , not for long .
my partner should be here any minute .
is it me , sir ,
or is the air positively fizzing with erotic anticipation ?
yeah .
oh , i forgot the ice .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m gonna get it .
oh , i couldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
no , not a problem .
as you wish .
same price either way .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;m looking for mitchell .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s expecting you .
in fact , he &apos;s asked me to draw the two of you a bath .
this is crazy .
yeah .
i believe that &apos;s the plan .
enjoy .
thank you .
oh , good . you &apos;re back .
how &apos;s claire seem ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
you must have seen her out there . is she mad ?
w @-@ what &apos;s she doing ?
uh , she &apos;s dusting , sir .
oh , she always cleans when she &apos;s mad .
do me a favor --
bring her a drink
and tell her to get comfortable on the couch .
she &apos;s -- she &apos;s allowed on the furniture , is she ?
she &apos;s my wife .
oh , good ! i &apos;ve been looking for you .
well , you should have been looking for somebody
who was looking for you ,
because that &apos;s what i was doing .
come on , i have a surprise for you .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;ve been thinking
we need to stop being so uptight .
we are in vegas .
let &apos;s have a little fun .
well , i &apos;ll have to wrap my head around that , but okay .
now , i have just the way to kick it off --
something we could do together .
it &apos;s a little extreme ,
but i think it might be just what we need .
okay .
go on in .
are you crazy ?
oh , come on , cam , we deserve this .
all right , you get started ,
and then i &apos;ll jump in when it starts to heat up .
mitchell !
come on . then i will throw you into it , tiger .
rub a dub dub .
dear , no .
langham .
both of you ?
huh . well , okay .
no . no . no , not okay .
what are you doing here ?
you gave me your room key .
what ? !
don &apos;t act so shocked .
you told me at the bachelor party
you two lead separate lives .
you went to the bachelor party ?
yes , and i was starting to feel bad about sneaking around ,
but i guess i shouldn &apos;t have ,
now that i see what you &apos;re up to .
i &apos;m not up to anything !
i left my key by mistake .
we &apos;re all obviously tense .
let &apos;s take a deep breath ...
get in the tub ...
that &apos;s not happening .
you want to tell me
how you &quot; accidentally &quot; gave someone your key ?
you want to tell me why you spent all day
sipping tequila out of some guy &apos;s navel ?
you saw that ?
i guessed .
hi , guys . what &apos;s going on ?
hey , claire . can you please just come back ?
we &apos;re in the middle of an argument .
oh . bet i know why .
are you guys getting in the bath ?
or i &apos;m way off .
langham !
it &apos;s tim.he can &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
he has insane trust issues .
insane ?
langham , are you in there ?
go out this door .
in here .
gloria , hurry up , will you ?
he &apos;s on his way up .
i need to shave .
oh , you &apos;re here .
jay pritchett .
thanks for stopping by .
nice robe .
like hef , back in the day .
i &apos;m gonna cut to the chase .
i like your lifestyle .
i want a taste of it .
well , s @-@ sure , that &apos;s flattering , but ...
okay , the bathroom is all you--
gloria , it &apos;s burt tanner !
that &apos;s not burt tanner ,
that &apos;s long @-@ ham .
langham !
what &apos;s that thing doing here ?
just enjoying a dirty martini
before a cleansing romp in the bath .
that &apos;s not who the bath is for .
oh , my mistake .
welcome ... claire .
you &apos;re certainly gonna be clean
by the end of the night , aren &apos;t you ?
jay , i forgot all my hair products !
i &apos;m going to borrow from claire .
okay , the coast is clear .
jay !
go , go , go , go , go , go .
hey . phil , there you are .
ducky ! how &apos;d you know where i was ?
magicians run this town .
really ?
no . i &apos;m a shaving butler up on plus .
look , i felt bad about how things went down today ,
and i @-@ i just wanted to give you another shot .
right this way .
i really think you &apos;re gonna like what you see .
okay , let me just get everything set up .
metamorphosis .
they say the only constant is change .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , what -- i-- s-- what is that ?
oh , i don &apos;t even know .
something my wife bought .
let me just get rid of it . here we go .
really , uh , rubbing it in on that wife thing , huh ?
metamorphosis .
burt !
nice of you to come down a floor
and see how the other half lives .
if you will ,
raise it above my head and pinch it at my wrists .
go ahead and make it good and tight .
don &apos;t be easy on me .
okay .
now ...
as the lowly caterpillar becomes the majestic butterfly ,
as the tiny acorn becomes the mighty oak ,
so , too , do we complete our ...
metamorphosis .
so , it &apos;s the governor &apos;s bluff .
well , it &apos;s a huge twist on the governor &apos;s bluff .
no , no , no , no , no !
there were other elements .
you just kind of threw me off .
i forgot -- i was gonna --
as a flourish i was gonna use one --
a-- that &apos;s amazing !
y @-@ you lull me with this--
with this hacky quick change ,
and the whole time ,
you &apos;re changing the fake dog into a hot maid ?
it &apos;s brilliant ! it &apos;s magic !
no , that &apos;s metamorphosis !
like you , burt ,
i enjoy the finer things .
as a matter of fact ,
that &apos;s probably the cuban i ordered for you .
cam , if you wanted a bachelor party ,
you should have just said something .
well , i didn &apos;t know i wanted one until we got here .
and you &apos;re so &quot; eh , eh , eh , &quot;
i @-@ i was afraid to say anything .
okay , all right .
lucky for the two of you ,
i know you better than you know yourselves ,
and what the two of you need
is a little guilty pleasure ,
or should i say ...
the scotch delivery you had me on the lookout for , sir .
i like your style , pritchett .
you &apos;re in .
vegas .
this reminds me of my late grandfather .
he was scottish ?
he was a stripper .
there we go .
you &apos;ve got the touch , kid .
i was blessed with my mother &apos;s small hands , sir .
shall i order your complimentary ,
in @-@ room , hot @-@ stone massage ?
complimentary ?
all part of the excelsior @-@ plus experience , sir .
might be nice after a dip in your private lap pool .
oh , where has this been all my life ?
you know , i saw a harpist in the elevator .
can we get that for our brunch tomorrow ?
if it was up to me , yes , but unfortunately ,
that is reserved for our excelsior @-@ ultra guests only .
62 , 63 , 64 !
