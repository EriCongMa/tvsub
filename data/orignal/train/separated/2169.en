All units, be advised,
in pursuit of silver Camaro
heading east on Pokukaina.
Suspect now heading north on Coral Street.
Requesting backup.
All available units requested for immediate assistance.
Kono, give me your phone.
This is a burner, all right? Keep it on you.
Lay low. We're gonna straighten this out.
We're gonna find you as soon as we can. You got it?
Okay.
Everybody stand down!
Where's Kono?
No idea.
Steve, she was seen getting inside your car
outside the Palace.
Pop the trunk.
I know you want to protect her,
but Kono's wanted
for questioning in the murder of Victor Asanuma.
I got to bring her in.
Duke, come on.
You really think she had anything to do with that?
The Crime Lab matched the ballistics to her gun.
How do you explain that?
Michael Noshimuri used her gun to pull off the murder.
He set her up.
Victor Asanuma was
the star witness in Michael's manslaughter trial.
Duke, you and I both know he's the one who pulled the trigger.
That may be true, Steve,
but Kono's in a relationship with Adam Noshimuri.
His father was a Yakuza boss for 30 years.
The prosecuting attorney thinks maybe she did
her boyfriend's brother a solid by taking care of his problem.
Duke, you tell the prosecuting attorney
we'll deliver him the real killer,
we just need some time.
I hope you know what you're doing, Steve.
You know what you're doing, right?
McGarrett.
HPD is all over me about Kono.
Well, you tell them you don't know anything, all right?
Like they'd believe me.
Oh, listen to me.
We just got to keep our stories consistent, okay?
That's all.
Just tell me about this plane.
Hickam picked up an unidentified aircraft.
F-22s were scrambled, but before they could intercept it,
the plane landed here.
No markings, no logos, just a tail number.
No. It's not registered with the FAA either.
So we don't know who flew the plane
or where it was coming from.
All we got are bodies.
We have five dead.
Three were killed by sharp-force trauma--
either stabbed or their throats were slit.
The two others were shot.
Whoever killed these guys also landed this plane.
Know anything else about the victims?
No cell phones or wallets on them.
I'm thinking our suspect must have taken them off the bodies.
Also three of our vics have empty holsters.
Seem odd to anyone?
Not if it was a rendition flight.
What makes you think that?
Plane's unregistered, right?
There's no flight recorder in the cockpit.
I'm thinking these five guys were government agents,
the killer is their rendition suspect--
somebody resourceful enough
to be able to kill five feds, then land a jet.
That's one serious national security threat.
Yeah, and now he's loose on the island.
Steve, so I ran your victims
through the National Security database.
There ID's as G.S. Aids through the Department of Agriculture.
That's got to be a CIA cover.
What about the plane's registration number?
The tail number's registered
to a Webster-Cole Leasing out of Wilmington, Delaware.
It's an executive transpo company.
Word is is that it's a CIA front company
and the feds are using it to transfer ghost detainees
to black sites for interrogations.
Apparently, it was en route from Brisbane to Cuba.
I've got nothing yet on the prisoner that they're renditioning.
You get anything off the bloody prints we found
on the plane's steering wheel?
Yoke.
What?
It's called a yoke.
The yoke.
Yeah, I ran them, but there were no matches
in any of our print databases.
Well, of course there wasn't.
The CIA doesn't want him to exist.
Good. All we got to do is find an anonymous maniac
who butchered five people from getting off the island.
Hey, listen, I got to run, but,
um, I-I'll be here if you need anything, okay?
All right. Hey, you!
Hey. I was just coming to find you.
What are you doing here in Hawaii?
I am done.
Like, done done?
Yep. In a few weeks,
this thing goes in the closet.
I'm through collecting a government check.
So what's the next chapter in the life of Billy Harrington?
How about I tell you over dinner?
I'm seeing someone.
McGarrett.
In Amsterdam, you told me that was over.
It was.
And what happened between you and me was real.
And I'll never regret Amsterdam
or working together in Kabul,
but it's been five years, Billy.
Things change.
If things change again, I'll be staying at the Ilikai.
It was good to see you.
You, too.
Commander, my name is Luis Braga.
I run the Latin American counterterrorism desk here at Langley.
Why is Lieutenant Rollins asking questions
about a flight that doesn't exist?
Your nonexistent flight just landed in Hawaii
with five dead aboard.
What?!
You didn't know?
We were transferring a high-value target on that flight.
We keep communications to a minimum for security.
Just a suggestion:
maybe you ought to pay closer attention,
'cause your high-value target is now in the wind.
Mr. Braga, we can help you,
but you have to come clean with us.
Who is the prisoner?
Rafael Salgado.
What do we know about him?
Ever heard of NLM?
National Liberation Movement--
Latin American terrorist organization.
Salgado's got ten years in.
He was picked up brokering an arms deal in Australia
because we think he has knowledge about an upcoming attack.
An attack? Where?
Our intel suggests it's domestic,
on American soil,
and it's going down soon.
Okay, what do you want us to do?
I'm sending an action team to Hawaii
as we speak,
but for now, I need you to carry the ball.
But remember, we need Salgado alive.
It's the only way we'll stop that attack.
Whose house?
My family owns it through a holding company.
Who else knows that?
Just family.
Thanks for picking this up.
Kono, you should still be in the hospital.
It's not really an option.
HPD's looking for me.
They think I killed Victor Asanuma.
Why do they think you're involved?
'Cause we found his remains
in a barrel in a dockside warehouse.
Single tap to the head.
Crime Lab tested the bullet,
and it was fired from my gun.
What?
How?
Your brother.
After he got out of prison,
we were under the same roof for a couple of nights.
He must have taken my gun
and then returned it to my holster.
Did you know he was gonna do that to me?
Do you actually think I'd let him do that to you?
I don't know what to think.
You haven't exactly been transparent with me lately.
Hey, if anyone should be questioning loyalty here,
it's me.
You used my phone to spy on me.
Adam, I want to believe you.
From the beginning, you said
you want out of the family business,
but from everything I'm seeing,
you've taken over from your father as the Oyabun.
Kono, I told you...
everything I'm doing is to protect us.
Michael's putting together an army to fight me
for control of our enterprises.
I need our partners to think I'm still in charge.
I thought you were trying to legitimize the business.
I am. Kono, I promise you, I am.
But it's not that simple.
My father's allies stand to lose a lot of money,
so I need to make those moves very quietly.
If they see me as weak,
I'm dead.
I'll call you back.
What do you got?
Pulled the cell phone records of our dead CIA operatives.
One of the phones was used right after the plane landed.
Tried to ping it,
but it looks like it was turned off right after the calls were made.
Made to where?
Five-O!
Who are you?
Five-O.
Rafael Salgado-- where is he?
Who?
Rafael Salgado.
That's... that's Pedro.
Pedro?
Yeah, that's Pedro Silva.
How do you know him?
He's my son's father, but...but I haven't seen him in years.
We know he called you twice in the last hour.
No. I-I received some calls,
but they were hang-ups.
He called to see if she was home.
Where's your boy?
Excuse me?
Your son. Where is he?
Jack's upstairs. He's playing in his room.
Oh, my God.
Where is he?
Where's Jack?
Where's my son?
How long were you two together?
Just my sophomore year.
We were...
both studying literature in Peru.
Pedro was very political.
I didn't realize how radical he was
until he was implicated in a bombing on campus.
Two people were killed,
and I was pregnant with his baby.
So then you came here.
I got as far away as I could. I didn't...
I didn't want my child
to be associated with a murderer.
Jack...
Jack is all that I've got.
Just get my son back, please.
Something's not adding up here.
I mean, clearly, Salgado knew about his son the whole time.
So why show up now, when the feds are after him?
APB is out.
TSA's been alerted.
All right, so we got a terrorist
who's on the run with a little kid.
He's got limited resources, and he's smart enough
not to contact any of his known associates
'cause he knows that we'll be monitoring.
Well, then who does Salgado reach out to for help?
No idea.
But I think I know someone who might.
You look tired, Steve.
Something keeping you up at night?
A loss of nerve, perhaps?
I sleep fine.
You know this man?
Should I?
He's an NLM terrorist.
His name is Rafael Salgado.
I'm familiar with the NLM.
They claim to be ideologically driven,
but I think they're just a bunch of thugs and peasants.
This morning, Salgado killed five men and kidnapped his son.
I can't imagine what he has planned for the afternoon.
How do I find him?
What makes you think I can answer that?
A high-value target like this won't last long on his own.
He needs friends--
the kind of relationships you used to cultivate.
So if you were him, who would you go to for help?
You've come here to ask about a case?
Is that all you want to talk about?
I'm giving you the chance to save a little boy's life.
And what's in it for me?
The exercise yard.
15 minutes a day.
You'll get to see the sun again.
I burn easily.
Okay.
Let's go at this another angle.
You help me...
or I discontinue your pain medication.
What's next?
No dessert?
There's a gentleman named Arturo Casey in Waikiki.
He controls an international investment company
called Outrigger Securities.
Makes most of his money off the books.
Doing what?
He traffics in arms, explosives,
chemical weapons, identity papers.
Very resourceful, I'm told.
Hey, that's funny,
you're the second McGarrett we've had here in 48 hours.
What do you mean-- second McGarret?
Doris McGarrett. You two related?
She came in yesterday morning.
People who worked for my father
used this place as a supply depot.
If there's proof my brother killed Victor Asanuma,
It's going to be in here somewhere.
Adam.
You got something?
Get out of sight.
Brother?
What are you doing here?
I need a gun. I got heat.
How much heat?
A lot.
Cops are asking questions about those bodies
they dug up.
Even Kono doesn't trust me.
She cloned my damn phone.
I need to protect myself.
You got something?
If you needed a piece, you should've come directly to me.
That's what I'm doing here.
S & W J-Frame.
Reliable as a rooster in the morning.
Clean, too.
What are you doing?
Give me the gun.
It's only a five-shot, so make sure
you're close enough to make each one count.
Something wrong?
I told you.
No.
Something else?
Why?
Should there be?
I was just asking.
Thanks, brother.
Appreciate it.
You okay?
Yeah.
What was Michael doing in there?
After you left, he searched the van.
I think he was looking for these.
Michael must have left them there.
Is that blood?
Yeah, and dirt.
If we can match the blood to Asanuma
and the dirt to the body dump,
that might be enough to take the heat off of me.
And help prove Michael pulled the trigger.
I'm sorry, Adam.
Everyone's looking for you, Kono.
That's why I called you.
I need a favor.
What kind of favor?
I need you to run these for DNA.
I'm fighting for my life, Charlie.
Evidence on these gloves could put me in the clear.
All right.
Thanks.
I don't know who the hell you think you are,
but you just can't walk into my office
and arrest me for no reason.
I'll have your badge, you hear me?
Okay, Mr. Casey, here's the thing:
usually I'd dance with you for a while in here,
but I don't have any time today, okay?
So do me a favor, tell me,
Rafael Salgado-- where is he?
Never heard of him. How would I know?
Because, despite the expensive suit
and the nice watch, you're just the type of
morally bankrupt low-life scumbag
who would give him a car, some cash and a fake I.D., okay?
So you've got one minute exactly
to tell me everything you know.
And what happens if I decide not to cooperate?
Well, it's simple. I'm gonna let you go.
Beautiful.
We're on the same page.
Not quite.
Right after I let you go,
I'm gonna spread the word that you were in here,
cooperating with Five-O.
And when I tell them
that you were squealing like a pig to save your own skin,
every animal you've ever helped
is gonna start crawling out of the woodwork.
And they've gonna come back and put a bullet in you,
your wife and your two kids.
Did you just threaten my family?
30 seconds.
You'd have me killed?
This is ridiculous.
20 seconds.
I've got rights!
The Supreme Court says you do not have rights
when you provide material support
for a foreign terrorist network.
But I'm really glad you're paying attention,
'cause you have seven seconds.
Time's up.
Wait.
Danny! Hey.
Listen, Casey said Salgado is driving
a black 2010 Escalade, okay?
Plate number is Alpha-Zulu-two-five-three-one.
All right?
Okay.
Alert HPD, and call Catherine after that,
see if she can locate it via satellite.
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wo Fat just gives you this guy, Arturo Casey--
I mean, what if he's playing you?
He's not playing me.
Listen, now that he's behind bars,
he's scared that Casey's gonna poach his turf.
That's why he gave him up in the first place.
This is not about him helping us,
it's about him helping himself.
Steve.
Just got your message.
What's so important?
My office. Now.
Okay.
You went to see Wo Fat.
Why would you do that?
Answer my question!
Don't yell at me, please, Steve.
No, no.
Don't give me the hurt feelings thing, Mom, okay?
Because "A," I don't buy it, and "B," I don't care.
Tell me right now. What could you possibly have
to say to that man?
Okay.
I just wanted to look the man in the eye
who orchestrated your dad's murder.
Changed the course of your life, Steve.
It all started with me.
If I hadn't killed Wo Fat's father, then...
everything would be different.
I got to say, for a former spy, you're, uh...
you're not very good at this at all.
What?
Lying, Mom.
I pulled the surveillance video
from the prison.
The audio was scrambled purposefully,
and your back was conveniently to the camera.
Just tell me one thing.
How'd you get the scrambling device past the guards?
I can't work that one out.
You know, if we're gonna
be in each other's lives, Steve,
you're gonna have to learn to trust me.
You have literally never given me the whole truth.
Ever in my life.
And you want me to trust you?
The night Wo Fat
came after you, you told me
that you two struggled over the gun and he got away.
That was another lie.
I know for a fact that you let him go that night, Doris.
Now, why don't you tell me right now
why you would do something like that.
Why don't you tell me right now who he is to you!
Okay, okay...
Hey... hey, we got a fix on Salgado's car.
Catherine's gonna put a satellite on it.
Okay, thanks.
To be continued.
Okay.
All right, I've got your black Suburban heading
westbound on Harding.
Left on Waialae, right on Palolo.
Where's he going, Cath?
Somewhere up the Ridge.
There's only one road in and out.
Get me a roadblock on Palolo and Kiwila.
Get out of the car!
Out!
On your knees, hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.
Where's the boy?
Where's Jack?
Get up.
Where is he?
Huh?
They took him.
Mi hijo. They took my boy.
We know about the phone calls to Lyla, to see if she was home
so you could grab your son.
No.
You're lying.
I'm not lying.
I didn't take Jack.
Okay, well, here's the part I don't get.
Could've hijacked that plane
to a non-extradition country.
Why would you come here and risk getting caught
just to go and kidnap a son you never met?
Because I didn't come to kidnap him.
I came here to protect him.
Protect him from who?
From the NLM.
They knew the CIA picked you up in Australia,
and they went after your kid, didn't they?
I was too late.
They got to him first.
Makes sense.
Kidnapping is a tactic consistent
with NLM security measures.
If an operative is captured, a hit squad is sent
to secure his family as collateral.
So they're holding Salgado's son right now to make sure
he does not divulge the target of their attack.
The priority is extracting information.
Keep Salgado detained.
My team is on ground and will be there
any minute to interrogate him.
Okay, but he's not gonna give you anything
if he knows it means his son is going to die.
My men can be very persuasive.
With all due respect, sir,
I agree with Detective Williams.
The best way to get Salgado to talk and to talk quickly
is to convince him we can get his son back.
Commander, I don't know what it is you have in mind,
but it's not happening.
I'm not taking any chances with thousands
of lives at stake, even if it means Salgado's son has to die.
I'm sorry?
Is that perfectly clear, gentlemen?
Yeah, it's perfectly clear-- connection's no good.
Did you just hang up on the CIA?
No, no, I, uh, hung up on a schmuck.
A gigantic schmuck.
All right, we're out of time.
So listen carefully.
You killed five CIA operatives.
You murdered hundreds of civilians.
The only choice you have left now is whether or not
you want your son's blood on your hands, too.
All right, you want a chance at being a father,
here's your shot.
You give us the target,
we get your son back-- that is my offer.
Why should I trust you?
You should trust us 'cause you don't have a choice, okay?
Clearly this kid means something to you, so...
What time is it?
3:27.
I was on the way to meet the men who took my son
when you picked me up.
All right, what'd they want?
My life in exchange for his.
You believe them?
That is the way we operate.
Okay, when's the meet?
4:00. A farm in Kaneohe.
If I'm a minute late, they'll put a bullet in my boy.
We can get to Kaneohe in less than 30 minutes,
but you have got to give us something.
What is the target?
What's the target?!
San Francisco.
San Francisco? What...
Where-where in San Francisco?
Trust goes both ways, yeah?
I'll tell you that once my son is free.
Catherine, get word out to the authorities in San Francisco.
Tell them the NLM are planning an attack.
Braga's people just pulled up outside.
Okay, they're gonna make us hand him over.
No. If you hand me over now,
hundreds of people will die, not just my son.
We have a deal, you made a promise.
Let's go.
They got the parking lot covered!
Out of the car.
Out of the car, let's go!
Five-O. We need your car, buddy. Let's go.
It's Fong.
Hey, Charlie, tell me you got something.
I processed those gloves
you gave me and found two sets of DNA.
On the outside, I got a donor match
to our victim Victor Asanuma.
And the DNA on the inside came back to Michael Noshimuri.
Looks like we found our killer.
Okay, Charlie, I need you to get that evidence
to McGarrett right away.
Copy that.
And Charlie?
Yeah, Kono?
You're a good friend.
Mahalo.
How did you get in here?
I think those belong to me.
You need to leave. Now!
Or I'm calling security.
Hang up.
Where's my son?
You are two minutes late.
I'm not exactly familiar with this place.
Or maybe you decided to make a stop
and talk to the cops?
I did what you asked.
I'm here.
Now let my son go.
Not in front of my boy.
Please.
The deal was my life
for his.
We lied.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay with me.
The target in San Francisco-- where is it?
What is the target?
What is the target?
Listen to me.
This man cannot die.
You understand me?
He cannot die.
Steve!
Max, what are you doing here?
Someone broke into the Crime Lab, Charlie Fong was stabbed.
What?
It's bad, Steve,
they don't know if he's gonna make it.
We're trying to stabilize your prisoner,
but he's demanding to talk to Commander McGarrett.
Excuse me, excuse me.
I got the target.
Hey, go, hide.
Kono?
Get away from her!
Thank you for finding these.
Where did you get those?
She asked you a question, Michael.
Your girlfriend tried to burn me.
And you let her.
You started this, Michael,
when you stole her gun to kill the man that put you in jail.
He had to go. And so does she.
I was only trying to save your life.
How does putting her away for murder save my life?
You've had a target on your back
ever since you crawled in bed with her.
And all I've done is try to protect you.
Not anymore.
It stops now.
Tonight she dies...
...I take over the business,
and you're on your own.
No! No!
No!
Adam!
Brah.
Department of Homeland Security, acting on information obtained
during an investigation,
thwarted an attack at Fisherman's Wharf tonight.
The attack was planned for 8:00 P.M.,
taking advantage of the peak dinner-hour crowd.
Mommy!
Thank you.
How's Fong?
He's in surgery.
It's still too early to tell.
It's all my fault.
He's strong, Kono; he'll pull through.
Where's Adam?
You need to leave. Now.
Adam...
the guys who work for your brother
are gonna want payback.
All right?
Yeah.
Okay, guys, we're all good.
Once we get to Shanghai, I'll take you inland.
And don't worry,
nobody's ever gonna find you.
How long?
As long as it takes
to put all your enemies behind bars.
I'm going with you.
Kono, you can't go with him, okay?
We just cleared your name.
Guy's about to go on the lam. It's not good.
I'm not leaving Adam.
Okay, Kono, you can't be serious.
You're not actually considering this, right?
Steve, don't stop her.
Follow your heart.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
It's not forever.
I'll take that as a promise?
Promise.
Thank you.
I'm seriously gonna miss you, sista.
Take care of these boys for me.
Be safe.
Can I go with you guys, huh?
That, I support. I support that.
Mom, I-- can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah.
I mean, he's just gonna end up getting himself shot,
so I figure I got to stick around for that, eh?
You'd miss him in a week.
I don't think so.
Why are you doing this?
I get to help people you care about.
It's the least I could do.
That's not what I'm talking about, okay? Listen to me.
You don't have to go with them, all right?
You make a phone call, get them squared away.
You don't have to get on the boat.
Yeah, but a phone call isn't gonna make people disappear.
And besides, my sources will only deal with me.
Soon as I get them situated, I'll be back.
Okay? To be continued.
Yeah, to be continued.
Okay?
Yeah.
I'll miss you.
Sometimes I wonder how different things would have been
if you hadn't blown out your knee.
Cousin, I don't even know what life would be like
if I wasn't cop.
I love you, cuz.
Aloha.
Malama Pono.
Time to go.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Leilani.
Hi. It's, uh, Chin Ho Kelly calling.
Look, I know it's been a while.
Yes, well, in my defense,
you did say to call when I was ready.
Yeah.
Um, listen,
I, uh, I can't promise anything as exciting as a prison riot,
but, um, if you're still up for it,
I'd love to take you on a second date.
Um, great.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Thank you for coming, Commander.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was coming even if you hadn't asked.
Yes.
You want to know why your mother paid me a visit.
I can answer that.
But first, you're going to do something for me.
And what's that?
You're going to get me out of here.
Is that so?
You set me up?
Yes, but not in the way you think.
They're not here to break me out.
They're here to kill me.
And you're the only one who can protect me from them.
From who?
