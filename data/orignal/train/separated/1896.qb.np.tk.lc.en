&quot; transplant wasteland &quot;
to a critically ill patient ,
an organ transplant means a new start ,
a second chance .
but the body is designed to fight off
any outside invader ,
even one that &apos;s trying to save it .
jackson avery really has a bigger say
than any of us in running this hospital ?
that can &apos;t be true . can it ?
well , he &apos;s a voting member of the management team
and he also represents the harper avery foundation .
and their 175 million bucks .
as opposed to our $ 15 million apiece .
according to stan ,
not only does he have the deciding vote ,
he can veto ours .
because a transplant doesn &apos;t guarantee
that it &apos;s an easier life .
that is ridiculous . he &apos;s a fellow .
so are you .
but he &apos;s a plastics fellow . and i &apos;m me .
well , let &apos;s not overreact .
i mean , it &apos;s jackson . he &apos;s not some corporate stranger .
he &apos;s one of us .
no , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s a smart kid .
he &apos;s gonna follow our lead .
no . no . we made this plan .
we pulled it together .
look , i &apos;m grateful to harper avery
for an infusion of cash ,
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna let some--some ...
plastics fellow ?
plastics fellow tell me how to run my service
&apos;cause his mommy said he could .
preach .
there &apos;s a threat that the body
will reject the organ outright .
it was your idea .
it was pillow talk .
and suddenly , it &apos;s a businss plan .
you were all for it at the time .
you investing in the hospital , sure .
anointing your son boy king ?
what on earth makes you think that young man &apos;s prepared
to take on this kind of responsibility ?
he &apos;s my son . i know what he &apos;s capable of .
and he &apos;s my student . i do , too .
you know , actually , i should revise that .
now he &apos;s my boss ,
and my girlfriend is my boss &apos; boss .
what could possibly go wrong ?
you are forgetting who you &apos;re dating , richard .
i &apos;m the chairman of the board of a large foundation .
i have made an extremely savvy investment .
and i will manage my investment as i see prudent .
i &apos;ve placed at the top of the organization
an individual that is energetic ,
motivated , and responsive .
there &apos;s only one room in which i take orders from my boyfriend .
this is not it .
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
okay , so we agreed that the peds and adult e.rs.
will be combined to save on personnel ?
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
i was running on time ,
and then my last rounds &apos; patient turned into a crier .
uh , we were discussing the reopening of the e.r.
and the trauma department .
oh , yes .
um , i &apos;m not ready for that just yet .
if you need more time with the material , we can go ahead--
no , no , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve read it .
uh , it &apos;s just that
the foundation feels like
the e.r. is not a forgone conclusion .
they need a site visit ,
a chance to look over the numbers .
it could be a month before a decision .
okay . the foundation knows we plan on getting
our level @-@ 1 trauma designation back , right ?
they know that &apos;s the idea , yeah .
uh , it &apos;s the fact .
i think we should table this until we can bring in owen .
uh , he &apos;ll have a lot of thoughts on this , too .
yeah--
that &apos;s--that &apos;s the other thing .
what thing ?
okay .
since we are starting fresh , the thought is that
new leadership would be good for morale .
what , like , uh , chief of surgery ?
oh , no way .
firing owen ?
okay , we &apos;re not firing owen .
okay , well , the foundation thinks that--
your mother .
the harper avery foundation--
your mother , avery . just say it .
it &apos;s a recommendation .
it &apos;s an inappropriate one .
oh , tell your mom that . this is bull--
and this is going nowhere . i have surgery .
you know , i don &apos;t care
who &apos;s giving you your marching orders ,
this thing with owen is not happening .
well , say what you want ,
but without the harper avery foundation ,
none of us are here .
and we appreciate that .
but no one expected them to come in
and start dictating policy .
yeah , well , no one asked you
to sue the hospital into bankruptcy either .
for the plane crash that killed lexie ?
if we put kepner &apos;s donor to o.r. 1,
that moves bailey &apos;s hernia to o.r. 5 .
robbins is in 5 .
okay , 6 .
we don &apos;t have enough nurses to staff 6 .
i thought you said you were getting them back .
i &apos;m trying . some of them are bitchier than i am .
chief .
u.n.o.s. just called .
they got a kidney that &apos;s a match for jaelynn donovan .
yeah , we have no room today , karev .
no o.r. staff . half the nurses have quit ,
including the transplant coordinator .
you may need to decline this one .
this girl &apos;s 16 .
she &apos;s been on dialysis for 3 years .
okay . all right .
well , we &apos;ll figure it out , okay ?
okay , so--
owen .
uh , just a second .
owen , they &apos;re talking about replacing you .
ruth , excuse us , please .
what ? w @-@ why ? who is ?
avery .
but we &apos;re not gonna let that happen .
i just didn &apos;t want you to hear a rumor
and think i didn &apos;t tell--
dr. yang , it &apos;s u.n.o.s.
they have a heart and lungs .
i &apos;m gonna talk to catherine avery .
you &apos;re not gonna do anything . i am . take your call .
dr. yang here .
bradley parker , 31 years old ,
end @-@ stage a.l.s.
uh , trach @-@ dependent .
had a lap @-@ chole three weeks ago .
now presents with a chief complaint of hematochezia .
he actually used the word &quot; hematochezia . &quot;
yeah , he was an internal medicine resident
at mercy west while i was there .
he did a residency with a.l.s. ?
he was diagnosed second year
and worked till he couldn &apos;t anymore .
he &apos;s an amazing guy .
is that coming from ...
hey , could you turn that down ?
hey , guys . what the hell is going on here ?
this is a hospital . there are very sick people here .
that includes you , too , brad .
okay , everyone out .
let &apos;s go . out . come on .
it &apos;s all right .
i invited them .
well , dr. edwards and i need to discuss your next steps .
so maybe if everyone could leave--
i already know my next step .
i &apos;m donating my organs .
we do organ donation after a patient &apos;s brain dead .
you &apos;re nowhere close to brain dead .
i &apos;m doing ...
mom .
he &apos;s doing d.c.d.
uh , donation after cardiac death .
he can give if his heart stops .
i &apos;m being kept alive
by this vent .
once we disconnect it ...
booyah .
chief hunt signed off .
welcome to my funeral .
avery ...
am i in or out ?
what ? that &apos;s--
word is i might be out of a job ,
so i &apos;d like to hear it from you .
yeah , there was a thought that
a change in leadership could be good for staff morale .
oh , for morale ?
i &apos;ve been killing myself to keep morale up
for the past three weeks ,
to keep this place open .
and no one is saying that you haven &apos;t--
nobody &apos;s saying anything .
i &apos;ve been shut out of every decision
that you people make .
and now i hear this ?
all right . calm down .
don &apos;t tell me to calm down !
guys , guys , guys . let &apos;s take this somewhere else .
oh , this is coming from you , too ?
you &apos;re all just talking about a new chief ?
no . no .
it was brought up , and we tabled it .
oh , you tabled it ?
you shouldn &apos;t even be talking about it .
listen , this is a decision that we have--
avery , enough .
i &apos;m just trying to explain--
avery , go !
you know as well as i do there are politics here .
we &apos;re trying to find our way . just sit tight .
i am through sitting tight .
i am through looking like an idiot
while you all lie to me .
no , we &apos;re not lying to you .
oh , when you said that we were in this together ,
i thanked you , and then one hour later , you quit .
you &apos;re a liar .
no , no , no , no .
you lied to the staff .
we are doing the best we can .
and then i &apos;m this poor sucker running around
trying to fix this mess that you all made !
you don &apos;t !
you do not want to get into whose responsibility
this is .
you don &apos;t want to get into who &apos;s responsible
for all of this .
you don &apos;t !
well , i can make this decision easier for you .
i quit .
owen , what happened ?
did you get the heart and the lungs ?
i--yes .
that &apos;s great .
talk to me .
nothing happened , i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m done .
i should &apos;ve been done a long time ago .
okay , what are you talking about ?
shepherd is right . this is all on me .
no one blames you .
well , somebody does .
and as long as that &apos;s true , i ...
i don &apos;t see how i can be effective here .
depending on when the organs come in ,
you might need to adjust the o.r. board ,
move things off until tomorrow .
sweetheart . owen ...
not the same .
surgeons save lives .
you just catch it when it falls out of someone .
o.b.s do surgery .
if a baby is not coming out ...
i go in , and i get it .
it &apos;s not the same .
oh , plus every patient that i have is two patients in one .
so beat that .
you wear pink scrubs .
yeah , you win .
i have no response for that .
you really pull it off , though .
oh , thank you .
alex , do you know jason ?
yeah , chest peckwell .
jason myers .
have you seen where jaelynn donovan &apos;parents are ?
isn &apos;t jaelynn up in dialysis ?
i know where she is . i asked about her parents .
excuse me .
are you getting on or what ?
i &apos;ll take the stairs .
turn to page six , everyone , the--
dr. avery , could you--
oh , come on in , sweetheart .
we &apos;re just going over the purchase agreement
you &apos;ll be signing tonight .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read through them .
can i speak with you outside for just a moment ?
of course . excuse me .
oh , of course .
no , i did not read through them ,
as i couldn &apos;t possibly read through them
as they are not in english .
i understand .
i am not a lawyer and i am not an accountant .
stop . breathe .
nobody understands those documents .
that &apos;s why these smart people are here to explain them to us .
all you have to do is hear what they have to say .
ask a couple of questions , and trust your gut .
now put on your game face
and go in there and listen to the suits .
try not to nod off when they start talking about
debt @-@ to @-@ equity ratios .
it &apos;s like a sedative . go on .
okay , one more thing .
when we are in there , i am not &quot; sweetheart . &quot;
okay ,
baby .
okay ...
what the ...
who is this ?
god . it &apos;s thelonious , dad .
we &apos;ve only been getting dialysis for , like ,
an entire year together .
i &apos;d be more comfortable if you were in your own chair .
it &apos;s bad enough to be in kidney failure .
now you &apos;re gonna suck all the fun out of it ?
i &apos;m just asking--
honey , let &apos;s not fight . not now .
it &apos;s too big a day .
oh , no .
what ?
we found a kidney , jaelynn .
no more dialysis .
oh , my god , theo . i &apos;m getting a kidney .
sweet .
sweet .
did anyone call jackson for this ?
who cares ? i mean , this is-- this is his fault .
why do we need an emergency meeting ?
hunt quit .
what ?
you can &apos;t keep throwing that plane crash in his face .
oh , don &apos;t make this my fault .
he walked out . you shouldn &apos;t have told him .
wh-- wait . wait . you told him ?
that he might be getting fired ? of course i did .
oh . nothing was decided , and besides ,
we weren &apos;t gonna let avery get rid of hunt .
avery has his own agenda .
no , warning owen is the least we can do .
we went behind his back long enough .
cristina , we should probably keep
what &apos;s said in here private .
well , then count me out .
i have a heart @-@ lung transplant coming in .
oh , well , karev &apos;s kid just got a kidney from u.n.o.s.
two transplants in one day ?
three with kepner &apos;s d.c.d.
three ? that doesn &apos;t happen .
well , it did , okay ?
and the o.r.s are fully booked .
we have half the nursing staff and no transplant coordinator .
who was handling all that ?
hunt .
oh , avery . hey , what are you all doing
about the , uh , pegasus protocols ?
the what now ?
pegasus put all these protocols in place ,
one of which is telling me that i have to do hernia repairs
using their stupid varner technique .
now i have a hernia repair today .
i would like to do it the way i &apos;ve been
successfully doing it since you were sucking your thumb .
we &apos;ll look at that .
well , when ?
there &apos;s all sorts of idiotic rules here ,
like the o.r. layout and organ transports ,
bariatric centers .
isn &apos;t that why you &apos;re the boss now ,
so the place won &apos;t be run by idiots ?
thank you , bailey .
you &apos;re welcome , boss .
hey , have you guys seen chief hunt ?
i would like to know why he signed a death warrant
on one of my patients .
well , good luck . he &apos;s gone . he quit .
he ... what ? hunt ?
ask boss man over here .
there was a disagreement about policy .
yeah , well , then change the stupid policy .
unh @-@ unh , not before he changes my stupid policy first .
my hernia &apos;s this afternoon .
they &apos;re going to get the donor heart and lung
as we speak .
we should have you in the o.r. sometime this afternoon .
oh , not a minute too soon .
you should &apos;ve seen what i coughed up this morning .
i swear to god , the thing had hands .
dr. yang .
i was hoping i &apos;d catch you .
hey , you get your fat head out of my door .
bad enough i gotta watch you go by my window
80 times a day while you walk your stupid laps .
i just want to know if dr. yang knows
about the pepperoni pizza you &apos;ve been smuggling in here .
snitch all you want .
i &apos;m not gonna be here much longer .
no kidding ? you &apos;re dying .
hey , there is a god , and he &apos;s heard my prayers .
uh , mr. schulz is getting a heart @-@ lung transplant .
a heart ?
well , he doesn &apos;t need a heart .
he &apos;s got junky lungs .
i &apos;ve been on this machine for three months ,
and you &apos;re giving that bastard my heart ?
you &apos;re not looking too good , herman .
somebody might be dying today .
shut up .
mr. crump , please calm down .
mr. schulz &apos;s heart is compromised because of
the stress caused by his pulmonary hypertension .
so a heart @-@ lung transplant is the--
you &apos;re gonna have pulmonary hypertension
unless you get a supervisor down here .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
a supervisor , now !
absolutely . right away .
so why do they hate each other so much ?
they were neighbors .
crump &apos;s wife left him for schulz , like , 30 years ago .
no .
yes . she ended up leaving him , too ,
for some other guy in the neighborhood .
no .
yes .
no .
can your mind be blown on your own time ?
right now i have to talk with my supervisor .
um , well , you own the hospital now .
so doesn &apos;t that make you the supervisor ?
it does .
so i will have that conversation with myself .
well , should i , like , stick around for that or ...
you &apos;re pushing all of our surgeries ?
there &apos;s no place to do them .
mer , i need you to do a kidney procurement in missoula .
i gotta stay here and do the transplant ,
and robbins is in surgery .
i can &apos;t . hunt is gone ,
and i have to sort out where all these patients are going .
come on . i &apos;m not gonna risk some missoula hack
screwing up the dissection
and giving me some unusable kidney .
jaelynn got a kidney ? can i do anything ?
i said i need a surgeon . you &apos;re not a surgeon yet .
and i forgot . neither are you .
upper management &apos;s too busy to get a kid a kidney .
call dr. shepherd and ask him to fix this board ,
and book me a plane to missoula .
the patient &apos;s this really sweet kid ...
whatever . you can come , too .
i @-@ i &apos;ve heard your plan ,
but you still haven &apos;t heard mine .
i can see not wanting a colonoscopy ,
but that &apos;s not the only option .
we could do radionuclide scans , angiography .
i mean , there &apos;s a @-@ a bunch of endoscopic procedures
that we could try .
this is why i didn &apos;t tell you .
i knew you &apos;d disagree .
and i didn &apos;t want to have to spend valuable minutes
of my life convincing you .
you &apos;re depressed ,
but we can treat that .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m a.l.s ...
is 100 % fatal .
if i donate my organs ,
my death can mean something .
if i keep fighting ,
i get an infection and can &apos;t donate .
i &apos;ve decided to stop fighting it .
so ... we &apos;re extra careful
and we just make sure
that you don &apos;t get an infection .
come on . please let me help you .
there are people who love you , who need you .
come on . you-- you are still alive
and so ... so you .
april .
yes .
you &apos;re fired .
this is where you should check your meds off every day .
okay ?
you &apos;ll start your mornings with prednisolone
and mycophenolate at 8 : 00 a.m.
then follow that with , uh , fk @-@ 506 at 10 : 00 a.m.
and 10 : 00 p.m.-- those are for every day .
then you &apos;ll also be on trimethoprim @-@ sulfa three times a week .
now you &apos;re just making up words .
look , you have to take them no matter what , all right ?
or you &apos;ll lose the kidney .
you can &apos;t miss a dose .
she won &apos;t .
fine . i &apos;ll do whatever you just said .
okay , the meds , uh , they can cause
pretty dramatic mood swings , uh , hair thinning ,
weight gain , diarrhea , acne .
i mean , they don &apos;t always happen ,
but if they do , don &apos;t be alarmed .
if you were dying , would you donate your organs ?
of course .
even if you still had time ?
mm . this the d.c.d. guy ?
i have a plan . he just won &apos;t even listen to it .
you know , he &apos;s a doctor . he knows the deal .
he &apos;s not gonna get any better .
yeah , but--
he &apos;s gonna save a crapload of people .
i think it &apos;s awesome .
he &apos;s got perfectly good organs . might as well use them .
oh , my god .
he has good organs .
that is genius . i am a genius .
so you &apos;ll have to pick up zola .
did you sort out the o.r. board ?
i started , but i have a surgery .
i have torres looking at it right now .
why are you on a plane ?
oh , because alex wants his kid &apos;s kidney
mobilized before perfusion ,
and he &apos;s being a giant baby about it .
all right . call me when you get back .
okay .
he doesn &apos;t mean to be a giant baby .
karev--i think he just hates feeling like
you guys left him in the dark .
you don &apos;t have to teach me how to speak alex . i &apos;m fluent .
i &apos;m just learning .
i shouldn &apos;t take it personally
that he &apos;s acting like he hates me , right ?
i mean , he &apos;s just feeling abandoned
by everyone in his life right now ,
and the fact that i &apos;m dating a guy and not available
to go to joe &apos;s bar every night is just--
he &apos;s feeling hurt
and lonely .
or he hates you .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
what &apos;s wrong ?
she locked herself in there .
jaelynn , sweetie . it &apos;s okay . come on out .
jaelynn , it &apos;s dr. karev .
look , jaelynn , come on . i know it &apos;s scary .
just come out and we &apos;ll talk .
you can ask me whatever you want .
it &apos;s the silent treatment .
she won &apos;t crack .
once we took her phone from her .
she didn &apos;t speak to us for seven days .
oh , she &apos;s talking to somebody .
she texting you ?
maybe .
tell her to come out of the bathroom .
i don &apos;t tell her what to do .
just do it .
make me .
are you for real ?
&quot; dr. d.f. &quot; ?
dr. douche face .
who &apos;s that supposed to be ?
who do you think ? now give it back .
make me .
it &apos;s called a domino transplant .
because you guys are the same blood type ,
we will put the new heart and lungs into mr. schulz ,
and then take mr. schulz &apos;s original heart
and give it to mr. crump .
so his heart in my body ?
nothing doing .
it--it &apos;s the best solution in this case .
the best solution is a 62 year old
getting a 70 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s hand @-@ me @-@ downs ?
technically , all donor hearts are hand @-@ me @-@ downs .
mr. schulz &apos;s heart is 80 % functional .
yours is only 10 % .
yeah , you hear that ? 80 % .
you &apos;d be lucky to get a ticker like this one .
i &apos;d be lucky if you dropped dead right now
and i got the fresh heart .
mr. crump , you should really consider this op--
look , i would rather croak
than have this bastard &apos;s old lump of meat in my chest .
this day just keeps getting better and better .
yeah , right . it &apos;s great .
okay , sir . you need to sit down .
no , i need to get out of this room .
please . get out of my ...
sir , calm down . just ...
so he &apos;s rejecting the heart out of spite ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t figure out how to talk him into taking it .
have you talked to owen ?
uh , no . but i know him . he just needs time .
what is your husband &apos;s deal anyway ?
oh , cristina .
you know , it &apos;s like everyone has gone crazy .
owen and derek are at each other &apos;s throats .
avery &apos;s on some kind of power trip .
you know , i am supposed to be prepping for a major transplant ,
and callie &apos;s left me with an o.r. board
that &apos;s like a rubik &apos;s cube .
wow . in charge one day ,
and already the hospital &apos;s spinning out of control ?
okay , i gotta go . we &apos;re here .
uh , you need to stop listening to my conversations .
is the place really spinning out of control ?
what ? no , of course not . shut up .
everything &apos;s perfectly fine .
where is everybody ?
they &apos;ve gone . we &apos;re pretty much done here .
what do you mean done ? where &apos;s our kidney ?
why do you look confused ?
where is our kidney ?
hands off my kidney !
i &apos;m telling you , this isn &apos;t your kidney .
and i &apos;m telling you ,
show me the paperwork to prove that ,
or i &apos;m gonna reach down your throat
and take one of yours .
i found our kidney .
great . now call off your attack dog .
wilson , stand down .
where is it ?
it hopped a flight to seattle .
all by itself ? how &apos;d it do that ?
i don &apos;t know . we gotta get home . come on .
let &apos;s go .
you sent her an emoticon of a bee and an ice cube ?
it means &quot; be chill &quot;
and come out of the bathroom .
i know it &apos;s you .
theo would never text emoticons .
just ... give me five minutes ,
and then i will never bother you about it again .
okay . five minutes , but in here .
i know you &apos;re scared , but you need this kidney .
at least with dialysis , i won &apos;t go bald ,
get fat , and poop my pants .
that &apos;s not the solution , and you know it .
can &apos;t i , like , take the next one ?
i &apos;m , like , not ready for this .
yes , you are .
look , jaelynn , um ,
there &apos;s this girl ,
and i didn &apos;t tell her that i was into her ,
and now she &apos;s with some dude with big arms .
um , are you , like , hitting on me ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re , like , old .
god . no . no .
no , my--my p @-@ point is ,
is that this--this kidney is a good thing ,
and that you need to take the good things
when they &apos;re in front of you ,
because if you don &apos;t , someone else will .
so you &apos;re saying , take this kidney ,
so some dude with big arms doesn &apos;t get it ?
yeah .
let &apos;s get her prepped .
don &apos;t leave her side .
got it .
hey . how &apos;s it looking ?
you sent me all the way out here to get a kidney
that &apos;s already flying coach to seattle
as an unaccompanied minor ?
what ?
i don &apos;t even know who &apos;s coming to pick it up .
find out .
alex , i--
look , just deal with it , okay ?
are you okay there ? you look a little overwhelmed .
anything i can help you with ?
can you read everything in my arms and own this hospital ?
you actually gonna look at those protocols
or just keep carrying &apos; em around ?
right . your hernia . i &apos;m gonna get you an answer
just as soon as i--
too late . i already did it ,
my way .
that &apos;s not-- bailey , you shouldn &apos;t--
well , you couldn &apos;t make a decision ,
so i made it myself .
you gonna get rid of me now like you did hunt ?
i didn &apos;t get rid of hunt . why--
sign this .
what is this ?
authorization for a domino transplant .
yes , why am i--
because when you anoint yourself king ,
it comes with certain responsibilities .
you have to sign this .
i need to know what this is first .
well , i could take the time to explain to you
how a heart @-@ lung domino transplant works ,
but by then , both my patients will be dead .
i know how a damn domino works .
hey , april . here , take these .
what are they ?
hunt left before he could coordinate the recovery teams
for your d.c.d. patient .
so it &apos;s just a list of which organs are going where .
yeah , well , he &apos;s not my patient anymore ,
for his request--
just sign this .
just handle it , please .
hey , make sure you sign your own name ,
not your mom &apos;s .
ooh . really ?
avery .
what ?
i want to know who the hell sent my kidney
flying coach to seattle
when i sent two surgeons to pick it up .
wait . what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s talking about the protocols .
look ...
pegasus policy states , look ,
&quot; donated kidneys coming from outside a certain radius &quot;
&quot; will be flown unaccompanied , &quot;
&quot; saving personnel hours . &quot;
so when the other hospital called ,
the nurse just told &apos; em to put it on a plane .
told you they were stupid rules .
you should read &apos; em sometime .
oh , great . does anybody know what &apos;s going on ?
tough day , boss ?
he is drowning ,
and he is taking my hospital down with him .
where is all this drama coming from ?
he will handle this . just give him time .
he &apos;s paralyzed .
decisions are like building blocks .
he &apos;ll make one , then another will follow .
you do not do this job ,
one calmly thought @-@ out decision at a time .
you &apos;re spinning plates , ten at a time ,
and you &apos;re doing it at a sprint .
he will get there .
you act like i don &apos;t have any idea
what i &apos;m talking about .
when i was chief , i worked hand in hand with the board .
so i know what it takes to--
you are not doing it now , richard .
i am not thinking of myself , catherine .
i &apos;m thinking of your son .
look , if he fails at this ,
it will follow him his whole life .
it &apos;ll define his entire career--
this failure-- and he didn &apos;t even choose it .
his mother chose it for him .
ca--
you find me a real heart yet ?
i &apos;ve got a real heart for you .
you just have to get over yourself .
move on .
whatever it is that happened between the two of you
is so far in the past ...
it &apos;s like it was yesterday .
okay , fine .
you can &apos;t forgive him . so don &apos;t .
beat him .
take his perfectly good heart and outlive him with it .
there &apos;s , uh ... really enough juice left in that heart
to get me to his funeral ?
there &apos;s enough juice to get you dancing on his grave .
then my heart will stop .
the monitor will flatline .
and you guys will have to get out of there .
mm . because the docs ...
will only have five minutes to open me up
or my organs will be no good .
are you sure ?
are you sure ?
don &apos;t do this now , mom .
i know it &apos;s selfish ,
but i want more minutes .
the closer it gets ...
i will support you either way .
but if you want to stop ...
we can end this right now and go home .
mom .
she just wants to make sure that if you have any doubts--
your son is still a doctor .
and ...
he wants to save a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl in idaho
who is gonna get one of his kidneys .
the other one is going to a 44 @-@ year @-@ old councilman in nevada .
his kidney could be president one day .
you get it now .
i do .
keep going .
half of your liver is going to
a 50 @-@ year @-@ old artist right here at seattle grace .
and a 10 @-@ year @-@ old in oregon will get to play
on his little league team &apos; cause of the other half .
did you get the o.r. straightened out ?
the place doesn &apos;t run without owen , derek .
you know it .
i didn &apos;t force him to leave .
but once he started talking about who &apos;s to blame--
because he feels the blame ,
every day since it &apos;s happened .
and you remind him again and again .
you say you forgive him , but you don &apos;t
or you won &apos;t .
so what is it ?
what is this about ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s not about him .
where are you going ?
surgery . remember that ?
no , i &apos;m in 2 .
no , you &apos;re not . i am .
move . i &apos;ve got a domino transplant .
and i &apos;m getting a kid off dialysis .
i can totally wait .
no , you can &apos;t .
well , i can &apos;t . let &apos;s get this show on the road .
this kid &apos;s a flight risk . find someplace else .
this o.r. &apos; s the only one that &apos;s staffed .
could you guys please shut up ?
my patient is trying to die in here ,
and he &apos;d like to do it in silence .
oh , god . he &apos;s dying in there ?
maybe you should go first .
how long is he gonna be ?
because yang needs the o.r.
i &apos;ve got an o.r.
shut up !
hey , all of you shut up .
all right , here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do ...
okay , just , uh , give me one second .
kepner , go back to your patient .
he can take as long as he needs . we will wait .
yang , you &apos;re in o.r. 2 .
what ? no .
heart and lungs trump kidneys .
take the patient back to holding ,
and the next o.r. that &apos;s available is yours .
you can &apos;t
that is it .
well , you heard the man .
he &apos;s the boss . now move .
it &apos;s about time .
you mean &quot; thank you , meredith
for carrying a kidney across state lines for me . &quot;
whatever . hand it over .
can i scrub in ? i &apos;d love to--
i got murphy .
you want me to apologize , alex ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry we bought the hospital .
i &apos;m sorry you have to think of us as your bosses now .
but we didn &apos;t do it for just us .
we did it for everyone--
for you , for wilson ,
who , by the way , fought so hard for you today ,
i thought she might cut someone to get you that kidney .
so drop the attitude
before nobody wants to work with you anymore .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about , shepherd .
move on .
oh , come on . this is costing me gas .
you can afford it .
nobody blames you for hiring the plane .
not me , not anybody else , and you shouldn &apos;t either .
you never would &apos;ve signed that paper
if you knew what was gonna happen .
let it go .
you blame me .
you said it , shepherd .
you said it again this morning .
i was pissed .
i &apos;ve been pissed , but not at you .
the world .
i &apos;m pissed at mark .
you gotta let that go .
it &apos;s almost time .
when the monitor goes , when he &apos;s gone .
they &apos;ll have to start operating , so ...
we should probably pay our respects now .
time of death--1846 .
start the clock .
no . no .
hazel , we only have five minutes
or this will all have been for nothing .
come on .
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
no !
honey , we &apos;ve been preparing for this . let &apos;s go .
come on .
no !
come on , dear .
no .
okay , i am--
i am sorry , hazel .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
come on .
no .
sweetie .
come on .
no .
was he there ?
no .
oh .
move over .
yeah . i heard you almost killed somebody
trying to get jaelynn her kidney ,
and i was kind of a douche face ,
anyway , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . and thanks .
can i , uh , buy you a beer or something ?
um , i &apos; m all set .
yeah , we both are . we &apos;re all set .
well , that was , uh ...
what were we talking about ?
i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
okay , thanks .
thank you , doctor .
he stepped up , didn &apos;t he , my reluctant son ?
if i were the kind of woman to say &quot; i told you so , &quot;
this might be the time .
he got through the day .
oh , come on .
can &apos;t you just say that i was right once ?
no , not when the stakes are this high .
you want him to step up , but the steps are too high ,
and the consequences for his career are too grave .
it &apos;s not fair to him .
don &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s not fair for my son .
you want to give professional advice ? fine .
but you &apos;re wandering into parenting advice ,
and that is not your place .
yeah , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . i overstepped .
yes , sir , you did .
you ever ...
you ever say something and then a minute later ,
realize you sound like a complete imbecile ?
um , that &apos;s ... never happened to me .
i &apos;ve been a single mom for 28 years ,
ever since jackson &apos;s dad ran off
to god knows where
because he couldn &apos;t stand the pressure of being an avery .
and i &apos;ve been looking for a man
who cared about jackson the way a parent would ,
and ... the moment i find him ,
i bite his head off .
you &apos;re always gonna know what &apos;s best for jackson .
okay , thank you , doctor .
yeah , right there .
okay , thank you .
that &apos;s it , then . wow .
we &apos;re officially the new board of directors .
for better or worse .
thank you .
congratulations , everyone .
actually , i &apos;d like to share
a list of a few things i think are our top priority .
you mean that the foundation thinks--
no , i don &apos;t , actually ...
mean the foundation or my mom
or these stupid protocols .
i mean me .
okay , well ... let &apos;s just listen .
okay , i &apos;ll listen .
number one , i move that we reinstate owen hunt
as chief of surgery , effective immediately .
dr. hunt has agreed to this .
there were some conditions .
which brings me to my second point .
we are reopening the e.r.
we will be a level @-@ 1 trauma center again .
that will be top priority
once owen hunt is here to share his input .
from now on , the foundation will follow our lead .
we will tell them our decisions as we make them .
well , hear , hear .
no , that sounds good .
i &apos;ve got one more thing .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t push it .
the transplant process is very scary .
we are building a new hospital .
and that was your vision , not mine .
my priority is to make sure your vision comes true .
and while it is important that we become
a leading center for research and innovation ,
we have to remember something .
we are now officially a hospital run by doctors ,
that should mean something .
it is our responsibility
to be the best doctors we can possibly be ,
so that those who come after us
can strive to be their best .
so ...
with that in mind ,
i move to rename the hospital .
again ?
why would we do that ?
to--to what ?
let me guess . the harper avery hospital ?
no .
i propose that we give this hospital a name
that can honor the very reason we &apos;ve come together
and been able to do this ,
a name that exemplifies the spirit of this hospital ,
but also the depth of our dedication .
a patient goes from worrying about getting an organ
to worrying if the organ will be rejected .
all in favor ?
aye .
aye .
the anxiety continues
until they can finally open their eyes after surgery
