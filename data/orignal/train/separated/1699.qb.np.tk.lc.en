hey , do me a favor and take table seven .
you mean the one with my 118 @-@ pound
rock @-@ hard stud of a fiance
who &apos;s prone to canker sores and pinkeye ?
nah , i prefer to look at it as the one with my ex @-@ boyfriend
and his gorgeous , successful and sophisticated girlfriend ,
who makes me feel like a toothless okie .
do you want me to spill hot soup on her ?
oh , please-- you &apos;re not that kind of person .
i know .
but if she orders something low @-@ fat
i &apos;ll totally give her the full @-@ fat version .
uh , that &apos;s my water .
what ?
my water . you &apos;re drinking it .
d @-@ dear lord !
have you been drinking it ?
yes . it &apos;s my water .
well , that &apos;s it then .
i &apos;m dead .
here we go ...
i &apos;m sorry , do i really need to connect the dots for you ?
the backwash into this glass
is every pathogen that calls your mouth home , sweet home .
not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue
of your subtropical girlfriend .
hey ! that &apos;s my sister
and my country you &apos;re talking about .
leonard may have defiled one ,
but i won &apos;t have you talking smack about the other .
you guys ready to order ?
yes , i &apos;d like a seven @-@ day course of penicillin ,
some , uh , syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting .
and a mint .
i don &apos;t understand .
he drank from leonard &apos;s glass .
&quot; he drank from leonard &apos;s glass &quot; --
the words they &apos;ll be carving into my tombstone .
that &apos;s actually my napkin .
oh , this is a nightmare !
where are you going ?
to the bar ,
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol .
gang way ! dead man walking !
all right . here you go .
two lemonades ,
one iced tea
and a root beer for priya .
is it diet ?
that &apos;s what you ordered .
thank you .
hey , have you and howard
started planning your wedding yet ?
yeah . we &apos;re thinking of having it on a cliff
overlooking the ocean .
nothing soothes those pre @-@ wedding jitters
like the thought of falling and drowning .
what did your mother say
when you told her you were getting married ?
he hasn &apos;t told her yet .
he &apos;s waiting for the right time .
i was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy .
howard , you &apos;ve got to tell your mother .
hey , have you told your parents you &apos;re dating
this short glass of skim milk here ?
uh ... that &apos;s different .
first of all , we &apos;re not engaged ;
and second , indian parents
are very protective of their children .
right , right , whereas jewish mothers
take a casual , la @-@ di @-@ da approach to their sons .
i gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit .
you all right ?
fine .
thank you for asking .
i love you so much .
fire demon .
ooh , fire demon .
sheldon &apos;s turning up the heat ...
troll master .
check it ! howard pulls one out
from under the bridge . nice !
water nymph .
oh , yeah , she &apos;s got puddles
in all the right places .
could you please play the game
without commenting on every card ?
sorry .
walking tree .
last one .
i &apos;m taking a stroll and i &apos;m sporting wood .
okay , the &lt; i &gt; eagle &lt; / i &gt; has landed .
what &apos;s going on ?
bernadette and my mother are having
a get @-@ to @-@ know @-@ you lunch at the old town deli .
oh , that sounds lovely .
hope so .
of course , if history is any indication ,
my mother will swallow her whole
and spit out her bones like an owl .
have you met bernadette &apos;s parents ?
you mean adolf and eva ?
not yet .
one goose step at a time .
sheldon , that &apos;s my water .
oh , dear lord !
that &apos;s not your water .
i know .
where &apos;s the mouthwash ? !
&quot; where &quot; indeed .
ma , i &apos;m home !
where are you ?
i &apos;m in the toilet !
so , how &apos;d it go ? !
too soon to say !
i &apos;m not done yet !
no , i mean lunch , today , with bernadette !
i had a pastrami sandwich .
she had eggplant lasagna .
like that &apos;s what a person orders in a jewish deli .
besides food , did you get along ?
did you talk ?
oh , sure ! did you know she &apos;s going to school
to become a microbiologist ? !
no , she never mentioned it .
i bet she did and you didn &apos;t listen !
yeah , that &apos;s probably it . so , what do you think ?
do you like her ? she &apos;s great , huh ?
she &apos;s a lovely girl !
cute as a button !
that &apos;s good to hear , &apos; cause i &apos;ve got some news .
i hope it &apos;s good news ,
because i &apos;ve got nothing but disappointment in here !
bernadette and i are getting married .
ma ?
you too busy bearing down ?
ma ?
oh , my god , ma ? ma ? ma ?
stand back , i &apos;m gonna break the door down !
son of a bitch ! ma , help !
hello .
haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
how &apos;s it going ?
oh , other than waiting out the exponential growth period
of the virulent organisms
trooping through my microvilli
into my circulatory system -- hunky @-@ dory .
did i say something amusing ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe , i have no idea what you said .
so your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy
with no semantic content at all ?
my mirth . classic .
is there a station coming up
where i can board your giggling train of thought ?
it &apos;s not a big deal , sheldon .
it &apos;s just , ever since leonard &apos;s been dating raj &apos;s sister ,
i &apos;ve had to keep my distance .
i don &apos;t get to hear all your jibber @-@ jabber .
jibber @-@ jabber ? !
i don &apos;t jibber @-@ jabber .
what are you doing at work these days ?
oh , i &apos;m working on time @-@ dependent backgrounds
in string theory ,
specifically quantum field theory
in &quot; d @-@ dimensional &quot; de sitter space .
okay , come on , even you have to admit that &apos;s jibber @-@ jabber .
interesting , do you know
where the phrase &quot; jibber @-@ jabber &quot; comes from ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re about to jibber @-@ jabber
about jibber @-@ jabber .
howard and his mother are at the hospital .
come on , we gotta go .
oh , my god ! what happened ?
i don &apos;t know , i just got a text . come on , hurry .
okay .
sheldon , let &apos;s go !
to a hospital ? !
full of sick people ? !
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
okay , well , your friend and his mother are there ,
we &apos;re going .
i can &apos;t .
oh , don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re afraid of germs .
not all germs .
just the ones that will kill me .
it &apos;s the same way i &apos;m not afraid of all steak knives --
just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax .
fine , i &apos;ll tell howard you didn &apos;t come
because you &apos;re more concerned
about your own well @-@ being than his .
i would think he would know that .
okay , you know what ? you are unbelievable .
you buy all these superhero t @-@ shirts ,
but when it &apos;s time for you
to step up and do the right thing ,
you just hide in the laundry room .
fine , i &apos;ll go .
just for the record ,
my aunt ruth died in a hospital .
she went in to visit my uncle roger ,
caught something and bit the dust a week later .
the two of them now share a coffee can
on my mother &apos;s mantel .
so i knocked down the bathroom door ,
picked up my poor unconscious mother ,
carried her to the car ,
and drove like a madman to the emergency room .
you &apos;re a real hero , howard .
no , i did what any son would do .
hang on a second -- you picked up your mother ?
her own legs are barely able to do that .
i was filled with adrenaline .
it happens to be how women lift cars off babies .
yeah , i &apos;m saying , it &apos;d be easier to lift a car .
what can i tell you ? after i found the courage
to put her pants back on , i was unstoppable .
so , how is she ?
they &apos;re running tests-- i don &apos;t know .
it may have been a heart attack or heart @-@ attack @-@ like event .
what &apos;s the difference ?
a heart @-@ attack @-@ like event
is an event that &apos;s like a heart attack .
thanks for clearing that up .
regardless , coronary problems are eminently treatable .
what &apos;s more likely going to kill howard &apos;s mother
are the antibiotic @-@ resistant super @-@ bugs
festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital .
okay , you &apos;re not helping .
disagree .
go sit over there .
i &apos;ll sit over there-- it looks cleaner .
is there a history of heart disease in your family ?
my family is the history of heart disease .
there &apos;s a cave painting in france
of one of my ancestors doing this :
so it &apos;s probably genetic .
well , maybe .
mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her .
what ?
it &apos;s not important .
come on , howard , i &apos;m going to be your wife .
you can share anything with me .
you &apos;d think that . but no .
you told her we were going to get married
and she had a heart attack ?
you can &apos;t take that personally .
how else is she supposed to take it ?
what you &apos;ve got to keep in mind is that
ever since my dad left ,
i &apos;ve been the whole world to my mother .
i mean , she &apos;d be threatened by any woman
who can give me what she can &apos;t .
you mean sexual intercourse ?
well , when you say it like that you make it sound creepy .
what happened ?
howard &apos;s mother had a heart attack
because i have sex with him and she can &apos;t .
bernie , wait !
i &apos;ll give you $ 1,000 if you &apos;ll drive me home .
nice of you to come for howard .
well , he &apos;s my friend . it &apos;s what you do .
i &apos;m sorry , did i miss something ?
it &apos;s just so weird .
howard wolowitz is my friend .
you know , once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat
and i broke his nose .
that &apos;s a little easier to believe than he &apos;s your friend .
yeah , tell me about it .
you know , my brother had a group of friends like this in india .
they dressed up in leotards and goggles
and called themselves the new delhi power rangers .
you mean when he was little .
not as little as you &apos;d want him to be .
you know , this stuff is horrible .
you want to see if we can find the cafeteria
and get real coffee ?
sure .
we &apos;re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee .
you want anything ?
i &apos;m fine .
that &apos;s nice that they &apos;re getting along .
your girlfriend and your ex @-@ girlfriend are hanging out together ?
oh , yeah , that can only be good for you .
what are you talking about ?
one of them broke up with you .
do you really want her telling the other one why ?
i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide .
good , good .
then you have nothing to worry about .
no , i do not .
you are a mean little man .
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be because my parents didn &apos;t love me ,
but actually they loved me a great deal .
bernie , it &apos;s not you .
she &apos;s just set in her ways .
how can we be together if the thought of us
getting married might kill your mother ?
it &apos;s the circle of life , sweetie .
one day our son will marry someone and it will kill you .
howard , i have to go to the bathroom
and no one will take me home .
what &apos;s wrong with the bathroom here ?
pneumococcus , streptococcus , staphylococcus
and other assorted coccuses .
sheldon , my mother is on her deathbed
and my fiance is grief @-@ stricken over putting her there .
i &apos;m not taking you home .
will you at least go with me to the restroom here ,
so you can open the door and flush the urinal ?
no !
this might be a good time to point out , howard ,
that friendship requires a certain give and take .
hold the door .
mr. wolowitz ?
is she okay ?
it wasn &apos;t a heart attack .
she &apos;s awake , she &apos;s resting comfortably--
we &apos;re still running tests .
can i see her ?
actually , she said , and i quote ,
she &apos;d &quot; like to see the little catholic girl first . &quot;
me ? why me ?
jews have been asking that for centuries .
there &apos;s no real good answer .
okay , well , wish me luck .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll be fine .
let &apos;s just hide mr. cross .
if it touches her , it burns .
you brought a catholic girl home to your mother ?
yeah .
why don &apos;t i write you a prescription for xanax .
finally .
采用传染性疾病护理程序
oh , what fresh hell is this ?
wait , you can &apos;t leave here , you &apos;ve been exposed .
no , i haven &apos;t .
it &apos;s all good .
you want to talk about crazy mothers ,
leonard &apos;s mom wouldn &apos;t give him any sort of approval growing up .
oh , the poor thing .
it makes him desperate to please women .
that &apos;s why the foreplay goes on and on .
it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s like he &apos;s trying to win a prize .
a word of advice-- don &apos;t doze off .
you will never hear the end of it .
help me !
come back !
penny !
there are a couple of things i did with penny
that might be a little silly , but ...
like what ?
every once in a while , before we &apos;d go to bed ,
i &apos;d put on a little show for her .
what do you mean &quot; a show &quot; ?
well , you know , the way i took my clothes off .
like , to music ?
i &apos;d look pretty stupid if there was no music .
so you &apos;d do a striptease ?
i wasn &apos;t swinging around a pole .
good , good .
there was one time i put body glitter on .
well , i don &apos;t think you have to worry
about penny telling my sister that .
no , she wouldn &apos;t .
your big problem is me telling her .
you really are a mean little man .
oh , god , that &apos;s so true .
yeah , i know , right ?
hey , what took you guys so long ?
oh , we were just chatting .
that &apos;s nice . what about ?
we were just comparing notes
about how you are in the sack .
that &apos;s funny .
yeah .
what if she wasn &apos;t kidding ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m the king of foreplay .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
you &apos;re a putz .
you know what that means ?
yeah . do you ?
your mother just taught it to me .
she thinks she got food poisoning from that deli
and she just wanted to make sure i was okay .
and are you ?
no , because i &apos;m engaged to a putz .
you let me believe i was the reason she had a heart attack .
well , based on the available evid--
shut up !
she said i &apos;m a wonderful girl
and that you &apos;re lucky to have me .
where are you going ?
to the toilet !
is that okay with you ? !
is it just me ,
or does she sound sexy when she &apos;s angry ?
mountain elf .
he takes the elf from off the shelf .
hell hounds .
hell hounds-- who let the satanic dogs out ?
who ? who @-@ who ?
colossal serpent .
i got a colossal serpent right here .
must you ?
sorry , i &apos;m just trying to cheer my buddy up .
rotting zombie .
sheldon &apos;s new facebook photo .
zandor , wizard of the north .
ha ! i win .
if you skip the part about being
under a two @-@ week quarantine
because you were exposed to a deadly disease ,
