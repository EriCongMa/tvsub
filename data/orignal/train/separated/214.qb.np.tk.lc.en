gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i thought we were friends .
damien ditched me after the party , so ...
strongest drug i &apos;m on is double macchiato .
i have decided to set my sights on bass industries .
it &apos;s not just his disloyalty . it &apos;s his pomposity .
and the fact that you slept with him ?
oh , well , that was a long time ago , and it was fleeting .
you wanted an internship . i wanted this one .
i stupidly thought that this fake friendship might be real .
i suggested that you be promoted to replace me .
blair , you wanted it all . you just got it .
i got a phone call from your friend blair .
so i &apos;ve decided to give you a second chance .
you need to do what &apos;s right for thorpe enterprises .
i want you to give chuck a chance
to be part of the new company .
i don &apos;t need chuck &apos;s help to run bass industries .
yes , you do .
what about your family ?
what if us being together drives them all away ?
i don &apos;t think it will ,
but that &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take if you are .
明娴 luna _ 3 山炮 ellfin
it &apos;s cold out there , but on the upper east side ,
things are heating up ,
because valentine &apos;s day is around the corner .
please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re leaving already .
between classes at columbia or your job at &quot; w , &quot;
the only proof that i have you still exist
is the faint trace of chanel in the morning .
i &apos;m so sorry , s.
but if i can turn this into a permanent job ,
it &apos;ll knock 6 months off my 2 @-@ year plan .
are you sure you &apos;re not just burying yourself in work
to avoid thinking about tomorrow ?
tomorrow ? i don &apos;t even know what day today is .
last year , chuck and i honored valentine &apos;s day
by staging our very own bacchanal .
and no , there were no goats ,
if that &apos;s the look that just fluttered across your face .
but this year , i &apos;m sitting out &quot; v &quot; day
to focus on my career ,
as is chuck with his fake relationship
with raina thorpe .
right , but i thought you reached out to raina
and told her that chuck &apos;s feelings were real .
he needed to get back in her good graces ,
and i knew exactly how to get him there .
chuck and i may need some time to forge our own paths
before we risk a romantic rejoining ,
but we &apos;re still there for each other .
and what about you and ben ?
it must be very special for him , spending valentine &apos;s day
with someone other than his cellie .
we decided to sit it out , too .
we just started dating . it &apos;s too much pressure .
hey , why don &apos;t you and i have a friends &apos; valentine &apos;s day ?
manis , macaroons , massages ?
uh , it sounds amazing . i &apos;ll let you know .
but ... if the 2 @-@ year plan wins out , will you be okay ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m glad you agreed to this brunch with chuck and lily .
it shows a lot of good faith on their part .
i mean , we came in with guns blazing ,
and they responded with an olive branch .
more like olive bread .
i agreed to a meal , raina . that &apos;s it .
i don &apos;t trust the basses . they don &apos;t operate like we do .
they &apos;re a family , just like us .
the lily i remember didn &apos;t have a maternal bone in her body .
family was just about money and power .
well , i hope hosting this brunch proves to you once and for all
i have the company &apos;s best interests at heart .
and also elegantly forces the enemy to come to you .
yes , sun tzu is right beside
emily post on my bookshelf .
but , charles , don &apos;t let your feelings for raina
affect your judgment . we have to be careful with the thorpes .
believe me , i know .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not banking on their sympathy .
welcome .
so ... is anyone hungry ?
how &apos;s the job search going ?
i think the check the &quot; have you ever committed a felony ? &quot; box
limits my options .
but yours seem to be improving .
i &apos;m sorry if i overstepped .
the article was just sitting there .
being single while living with the guy seeing your ex ?
we nailed the awkwardness .
yeah , well , it &apos;s very fresh .
it &apos;s a good thing serena and i decided
not to do anything for valentine &apos;s day .
i can &apos;t afford to take her out anyway .
well , you already read how awkward i feel about this ,
but , um , with me ,
she was always happy to just play pool and drink beer .
right now i couldn &apos;t even afford to do that .
uh ... well , you know what ?
i used to work for a catering company .
they could always use an extra hand around a holiday .
i can make a call , it &apos;s good money .
and--and no offense , but judging from my past coworkers ,
i think they have the
&quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; policy regarding felons .
uh , thanks . appreciate that .
uh , and , you--what &apos;s next for the article ?
uh , well , i e @-@ mailed my conde nast contact , epperly ,
but i got an auto response ,
saying she doesn &apos;t work there anymore ,
so i gotta-- i gotta facebook her .
i don &apos;t know about the cater @-@ waiter me ,
but the teacher me thinks
maybe you should step out from behind the computer
and find out who the new epperly is
and give her the article in person .
the new epperly . i hadn &apos;t thought about that .
as part of &quot; w &apos;s &quot; online expansion ,
stefano wants to kick off a new feature--
bright young thing .
we &apos;ll follow an &quot; it &quot; girl one night a month
as she navigates the manhattan social scene .
our inaugural &quot; it &quot; girl needs to be special ,
as should her valentine &apos;s day plans .
blair , you &apos;re friends with serena van der woodsen ?
yes . well , d-- serena definitely is &quot; it , &quot;
but what if there was someone fabulous
that we could break ourselves ?
someone like ... raina thorpe .
daughter of russell ?
i like it . keep going .
well , she &apos;s typically shunned publicity ,
which makes her an even bigger get .
so if i could come through ...
i &apos;d recommend stefano consider your trial period over .
i &apos;ll have her by lunch .
hey .
how well do you know raina thorpe ?
um , not at all .
do you know where she is right now ?
i &apos;m guessing you do .
at your house .
where my mother lives . no way .
we &apos;re still at war .
and why are you asking anyway ?
because i need to do a story on raina for the magazine
tomorrow night .
okay , well , why don &apos;t you just ask her yourself ?
after the chuck thing ,
doesn &apos;t she owe you a favor ?
yes , but she &apos;s not answering her phone ,
and i can &apos;t leave the office .
besides , it &apos;s better this way . just two &quot; it &quot; girls talking .
and explain that you &apos;ll do the profile yourself .
right , because this is all really just a favor to me
and not a convoluted way for you
to keep your eye on raina and chuck on valentine &apos;s day ?
mm , i hadn &apos;t thought of that . thank you !
lily , everything was delicious , especially the eggs .
ah , spanish tortilla .
that &apos;s perfect after a late night
or a breakfast in bed after too much rioja .
thank you , russell .
um , here in america , we call it a frittata .
did i just hear your dad laugh ?
i told you this would work .
i &apos;m going in .
okay .
mr. thorpe , we &apos;re all very grateful
we have found a buyer for bass industries
that we can all approve of .
and though it may be your instinct
to keep the company under the thorpe umbrella ,
that might be a mistake .
the bass name has equity .
i &apos;d like the chance to prove that all in one night--
tomorrow , to be exact .
i &apos;ve leased a landmark mansion outside the city .
it &apos;s a destination . you travel to get there ,
and the reservations are made before .
and what do people get when they arrive ?
imagine you &apos;re at a club .
forget the year , the continent .
you don &apos;t want the night to end .
in this case , it doesn &apos;t have to .
when the time is right ,
you drift upstairs to a private room .
spend the night or just a few hours .
it &apos;s up to you .
but , uh , what makes you think people will show up ?
it sounds like you need a big marketing push
just to get the word out .
no marketing .
i say where and when , people show up .
if i can prove to you
the bass brand has a quantifiable worth ,
will you look at my business plan ?
it shows how you can keep the company together
under the bass name ,
with my involvement .
i &apos;ll put a pin in my current plans for ...
36 hours .
if this thing you &apos;ve planned succeeds ,
we &apos;ll talk .
you nailed it .
i &apos;ll see you at the hotel , dad .
serena . we weren &apos;t expecting you .
i &apos;m here to see raina .
hey , we haven &apos;t officially met ,
but our mutual friend blair waldorf
wants to talk to you . she &apos;ll explain everything .
blair has to follow a socialite
around on valentine &apos;s day .
it &apos;s for work , she figured you wouldn &apos;t mind
since everything with raina is , you know ...
i know what ?
oh . blair was wrong .
you do have feelings for raina .
i do .
i have something spectacular planned for tomorrow night .
uh @-@ oh . b. &apos; s in for a shock when she finds out
what she thought was as fake as a c.z.
is actually as real as harry winston .
oh , my gosh .
all the shoppers on madison are so stressed .
it &apos;s like the entire future of humanity lies in the balance .
&quot; should i get him boxers or cologne ? &quot;
&quot; are red roses clich ? &quot;
&quot; if i hide the ring in her food , will she choke ? &quot;
i &apos;m so happy we &apos;re sidestepping valentine &apos;s .
you sure ? it &apos;s not very romantic .
speak for yourself .
i have a hot date with my blu @-@ ray player .
what about you ? what are you doing ?
believe it or not , i am working .
really ? ben , that &apos;s great . where ?
uh , it &apos;s nothing big , but it &apos;s a start .
oh , let me guess . uh , at a publishing house ?
tutoring service ?
um ... you &apos;re doing research for a professor ?
you &apos;d be so good at that .
uh ... i--how &apos;d you know ?
so which one is it ?
tutoring .
well , all you have to do is get one kid into an ivy ,
and your phone will be ringing off the hook .
i have to go meet a friend ,
but i &apos;ll see you on the 15th
when all this craziness is over . happy tutoring .
thanks . uh , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
hey , there you are . listen , we need to talk to you .
not now , archibalds . russell bit .
my party tomorrow needs to be legendary ,
if i &apos;m going to secure my place after the takeover .
forget it .
whatever russell thorpe promised
you is a lie .
i think i &apos;ll take my advice from someone
not interested in grinding an ax across my knuckles ,
if you don &apos;t mind .
after you and nate tried to get me fired , i realized that
your actions weren &apos;t completely unwarranted ,
so i asked to be taken off
of all bass business ,
and thorpe agreed .
but this morning i was copied on a report
i shouldn &apos;t have been .
it was a breakdown of how russell &apos;s gonna sell
your company for parts and who he &apos;s selling them to .
your intel &apos;s stale .
we brokered a deal at brunch .
russell promised to postpone those meetings .
just confirmed one an hour ago .
and something else .
i dug around accounting .
bass industries is more profitable kept whole .
so why is thorpe determined to slice it up ?
russell didn &apos;t become a billionaire
by making money @-@ losing decisions .
look , you told me he had issues with bart , right ?
so maybe it isn &apos;t a business decision . maybe it &apos;s personal .
so you sound pretty excited about tomorrow ,
like maybe it &apos;s not just another night
of hanging out with chuck , business as usual ?
i guess that &apos;s true .
at first , it was purely for the sex .
oh , that &apos;s chuck .
no , i meant me .
chuck was just trying to get me to help him with my father .
&quot; was &quot; ? but now ?
things have gotten kind of serious .
i wanna find an amazing dress
and totally take his breath away .
oh , well , that-- that does sound serious .
so how about a little help ? it &apos;s overwhelming .
oh , well , the secret about these places
is that they always keep the best stuff in the back ,
which is why i called ahead .
what do you think ?
ohh . wow . that &apos;s the one . our work here is done .
no need to try this one ,
even though i love the detail .
i actually really love this dress .
then try it on .
you can wear it tomorrow to the club .
oh , no , i wish , but i have other plans .
something &apos;s better than a chuck bass party ?
if serena van der woodsen isn &apos;t going ,
maybe he was exaggerating
the value of his so @-@ called brand .
no , it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;m in a new relationship ,
but we &apos;re trying to keep things simple .
ah . you know how it is .
speaking of , are you sure it &apos;s a good idea
for you and chuck to be doing this thing for &quot; w &quot; ?
i normally pass on all publicity ,
but blair asked me , so i couldn &apos;t say no .
i know how important she is to chuck ,
and she knows how important i am to him , too , obviously .
so i &apos;m glad there &apos;s no weirdness there .
well , actually , there may be some weirdness .
blair still has feelings for chuck ,
so if she follows you around on valentine &apos;s day ,
she &apos;s gonna be hurt .
and if she finds out i ever told you this ,
i &apos;ll be hurt .
i hope my best friend would do the same for me .
your secret &apos;s safe .
i do hate to cancel last minute , though .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll understand .
besides , before &quot; w &quot; gave her this assignment ,
she wanted to spend valentine &apos;s day with me anyway ,
so ...
waldorf .
where &apos;s the new epperly ?
you &apos;re looking at her .
oh , god , what &apos;d you do to her ?
she &apos;s in a better place .
she &apos;s in bali doing downward dogs
with some british wally named prat
or prat named wally .
in any case , she quit .
that &apos;s great . my only contact at condenast
has been replaced by a stapler stealer .
and i will staple whatever &apos;s in your sweaty hand to your jeans
if you don &apos;t leave this instant .
what &apos;s in my hand is an article .
epperly said she &apos;d get it to &quot; details . &quot;
i &apos;m assuming you can &apos;t do the same .
i @-@ i did ... i did kinda get this job for you .
only after you got me fired .
how many times must i repeat myself ?
we are not friends . just because we went to go see a movie ...
or five together does mean that
i &apos;ll go out on a limb for you .
okay , well , how about i just drop it in your in @-@ box ?
as you can see , i don &apos;t have time
to read faux @-@ ticles by wannabe writers .
blair , please .
i &apos;ll apply for another internship if i have to
and get back in the ring with you .
remember our little wrestling match ?
how about you apply yourself to a job more within your breeding ?
isn &apos;t there a bat mitzvah girl
somewhere in need of a shirley temple ?
no , actually , i gave my cater @-@ waiter contact to ben .
he &apos;s doing martha stewart &apos;s valentine &apos;s party .
raina , hi . i have those advanced questions
like you asked for . should i fax them ?
i &apos;m really sorry , blair ,
but i &apos;m not gonna be able to do the profile .
what ? why ?
i should have never agreed to do a social piece . i just ...
think it &apos;s not a good idea .
guess you &apos;ll have time to read my article now .
chuck , hello .
hey , i was just wondering--
do you actually know why you father hates mine ?
i always assumed it was a business deal gone bad ,
but maybe there &apos;s more to it .
i don &apos;t think so .
my dad &apos;s too much of a gentleman to hold a grudge ,
and honestly , i don &apos;t even know
how serious they were--either of them .
i was at penn at the time .
why ? what did lily say ?
lily ? say about what ?
you don &apos;t know ? she and my dad used to date .
she left him for your father .
looks like this was one love letter
lily didn &apos;t want anyone else to read .
hey , thanks for meeting me .
i &apos;m surprised my dad and lily let you out of the house ,
even for food .
oh , well , it might have something to do
with my volunteering or , uh , voluntary drug testing .
look , the schnitzel &apos;s on me .
i &apos;m sorry about lying last week .
oh , thanks . have you heard from damien ?
uh , no , actually . uh , knowing the ambassador ,
after you told him damien was dealing ,
i &apos;m sure he was exiled to some very cold ,
very distant country . you know who else
i haven &apos;t heard from , though , is , uh , is jonathan .
see , i ... i knew he probably didn &apos;t wanna talk to me again ,
but i @-@ i thought he &apos;d at least return my call and tell me so .
well , leaving a message for someone isn &apos;t very romantic .
have you thought about doing something big for him
or show him how much you wanna see him ?
like what ?
like inviting him to chuck &apos;s event .
uh , i am not going to chuck &apos;s event .
i have a hot date with a vehicle filled with hot meals .
i would feel sorry for myself except i am delivering food
to people too sick to cook .
oh , hey , at least it would be original .
jonathan was never one for cliche .
so make the play , man . go out in a blaze of glory ...
or at least a double @-@ parked panel van .
ah , yeah , i really should take my own advice .
why ? who do you wanna spend valentine &apos;s day with ?
blair .
no , it &apos;s not--no , no , no . it &apos;s not like that .
it &apos;s , uh ... i ... i need her help with something .
you could be waiting a long time .
you &apos;re right , which is why i &apos;m gonna find her
at the party tonight .
may both our fortunes change for the better .
can i interest you in some nucky ?
i snuck out of work early
to catch up on &quot; boardwalk empire . &quot;
i need a primer on
how to do business with chicago .
raina won &apos;t recommit .
i didn &apos;t realize the profile was that big of a deal .
she seemed so into it at first .
i need to find out why she backed out .
well , if the profile isn &apos;t happening ,
we can do that friends valentine &apos;s
like i suggested .
well , i &apos;d hate to have nothing planned , but first ,
ben is prison @-@ poor .
who is showering you with gifts on valentine &apos;s day ?
just my mom .
she was glad that i came by . thank you for sending me .
i &apos;m gonna go call the masseuse .
this won &apos;t take long , russell . i know you &apos;re a busy man .
good .
i believe there &apos;s something standing in the way
of bass industries &apos; survival-- something of a personal matter .
to what exactly are you referring ?
i know lily broke your heart .
she broke my father &apos;s heart , too .
i wanna be clear .
my loyalty is with the bass name only .
that &apos;s a lovely sentiment , but what does it mean ?
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to stay in the company .
if lily is an obstacle , i &apos;ll handle it .
saying it is one thing , chuck .
following through is an entirely different matter .
the woman adopted you after your father died .
she &apos;s the only family you have .
holmberg ? chuck bass . gather the board .
it &apos;s been brought to my attention
that lily failed to disclose
a significant conflict of interest
with thorpe enterprises .
it needs to be handled immediately .
i &apos;ll explain when i &apos;m back .
yet again , i &apos;m impressed .
stay the course .
and i see no reason to believe that you and your legacy
won &apos;t be well taken care of when the sale goes through .
thank you , sir .
aren &apos;t you a little overdressed for hot stones ?
donna called . she needs me at work .
oh , this is terrible .
the masseuse is already on her way .
i was really looking forward to spending time with you .
you have no idea how much .
s. , cancel the masseuse and go to chuck &apos;s .
no one should be alone tonight ,
and it would mean a lot to him to have you there ,
not because you &apos;re an &quot; it &quot; girl ,
but because he considers you family .
well , i told ben that i was staying in ,
but he &apos;s tutoring , so he won &apos;t mind .
tutoring ? are you sure ?
don &apos;t make fun . he was so nervous ,
he didn &apos;t even wanna tell me . i think it &apos;s noble .
no , of course you do , and you should .
tutoring is great .
now go put on your sexiest dress
and treat yourself to a night out .
thank you for saving me from a valentine &apos;s day
even more depressing than the movie about it i was gonna watch .
can we please have friend time after , though ?
i think it &apos;ll be too late for that .
i &apos;m sorry .
&quot; love actually &quot; and the jacques torres fondue
will have to wait .
i just got off the phone with pete holmberg .
there was an emergency meeting of the bass board .
i &apos;m being accused of an ethics violation and conflict of interest .
well , stand up for yourself .
don &apos;t let thorpe get away with that .
it wasn &apos;t thorpe . it was charles . he had me removed
from the board effective immediately .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know what deal he cut with thorpe ,
but it is not the way to win .
yes , hello . i &apos;m calling on behalf of chuck bass .
his friend dan humphrey sent over a new employee today--
ben donovan .
mr. bass wants to be sure
that ben is only working his event tonight
and nowhere else .
can you see to it ? thank you so much .
2,500 bucks a head ,
and it &apos;s filled to capacity . this place is a gold mine .
i know how to tap a vein .
a few days ago , this was pillow talk .
look at the ways you inspire me .
you &apos;re the one who pulled it off .
no one &apos;s gonna forget tonight .
go get some b @-@ roll of the food and drink ,
and be discreet . we are not tmz .
humphrey , what are you doing here ?
stalking you , actually .
you didn &apos;t , by chance , read my article ?
i don &apos;t need to . i know what it &apos;s about--
a boy from brooklyn
and an untouchable upper east side blonde .
well , uh , as a matter of fact ...
i work at &quot; w &quot; now . i &apos;m an arbiter of taste .
if i were to stand behind some lame humphrey lamentation ,
then it would be like showing up
at an accessories shoot in crocs .
how do you know it &apos;s lame ? you haven &apos;t read it . maybe--
maybe i &apos;ve matured as a writer , or maybe you &apos;ve matured
as a person and can help someone out
who really needs it just because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a valentine &apos;s vendetta to exact .
where the hell is my crew ?
there she is . start rolling .
what the hell are you doing ?
i thought you were gonna be working all night .
i am . &quot; w &quot; sent me here with a cameraman
to get good stuff for the blog ,
and if i go back with only footage of amanda lepore
and ed burns ,
then my 2 @-@ year plan might as well become 20 .
okay , fine , they can interview me ,
but please tell them to keep it brief .
thank you , thank you , and it will be over before you know it .
can we get some light over here , please ?
lily . looking beautiful as always .
oh , spare me the niceties , russell .
i &apos;m here to speak to charles .
he &apos;s off with raina somewhere .
you know , they &apos;re a wonderful couple , don &apos;t you think ?
what i think is that whatever it is you &apos;re up to appears to be working ,
and my son should know that . excuse me .
sorry to interrupt , but , uh , we need to have a little talk .
you realize you &apos;re the worst wingman ever .
well , maybe so ,
but i hope you see i &apos;m trying to be a good father .
i came here tonight to find russell ,
say hello ,
and hand in my resignation .
since i kept you from your trip to venice ,
i thought i &apos;d bring venice to you .
how did you know ?
i saw your calendar .
buona sera , arrigo .
your favorites from harry &apos;s bar .
i can &apos;t believe you did this for me .
when i care about someone , i &apos;m not afraid to show it .
hello , daniel .
have you seen charles ?
and any resort plans this season ?
uh , mustique , maybe ? i don &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t really thought about it .
shoe of the moment .
uh , louboutin &quot; bianca . &quot;
are we almost done ?
have you asked her who her valentine is ?
we were instructed to ask everyone .
uh , i &apos;m not gonna answer that .
i &apos;d like to keep my private life private .
but you do have a special someone--
ben donovan .
he &apos;s standing at the bar right now .
or make that behind it . don &apos;t be embarrassed , s.
it &apos;s okay to below the line .
madonna and julia roberts
paved the way for girls like you .
so much for the quiet night at home .
and i thought you were tutoring .
i wasn &apos;t . i just didn &apos;t know how to tell you .
tell me what ?
you go , serena .
give that convict a chance to explain himself .
before ben was serving drinks , he served three years hard time .
in fact , he &apos;s been out on parole for what , a month ?
ben , please , wait .
okay , that &apos;s enough . let &apos;s go .
you know , i think that we &apos;ve seen enough
of each other tonight .
lily , how dare you just barge in here .
this place is supposed to be my fantasy ?
all i wish for is the truth . why did you have me fired ?
you should &apos;ve told me about your relationship with russell .
if you were so concerned , why didn &apos;t you ask me about it ?
he has no bearing on my performance at bass industries .
how can you be sure ? maybe your emotions
clouded your judgment . it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
what ?
we both know you &apos;re a socialite , not a businesswoman .
you traded musicians for titans of industry ,
upgraded from a tour bus to a corporate jet .
i &apos;m sorry , but i had to .
i &apos;ve done nothing but try to salvage that company for you .
i stepped in so jack wouldn &apos;t take it away ,
and every day since , i have fought for your future .
if we had stuck together on this , we would &apos;ve won .
it looks like i did , anyway .
no , you haven &apos;t , charles .
you &apos;ve lost ,
and i &apos;m not talking about your battle with thorpe .
please , that adoption was as much a business decision
as this was .
chuck . that &apos;s enough .
wait . where are you going ?
anywhere but here .
you almost cost me my company .
you &apos;d better not have cost me raina .
whatever price you pay for what you &apos;ve done ,
that &apos;s on you .
i see you &apos;re a man of your word .
i said i &apos;d get rid of lily . i did .
too bad words are overrated .
what ?
now that lily &apos;s been ousted from the board ,
it &apos;s just you and me . and as much i like you ,
i think i &apos;ll like dismantling bass industries a lot more .
now you have no company ,
no family , and from what i just saw ,
my daughter &apos;s lost her taste as well .
great party , by the way .
you think raina will keep you on that pedestal
once she learns what you &apos;ve done ?
go find out .
i think you know how much family means to raina ,
just as she now knows ...
how little it means to you .
one lonely bass adrift at sea .
looks like venice isn &apos;t the only thing that &apos;s sinking .
blair .
i can &apos;t believe you ambushed me ,
and why ? for a leg up at work ?
is your career really more important than our friendship ?
obviously you don &apos;t think my career is important at all
since you forced raina to back out
just so you didn &apos;t have to be alone on valentine &apos;s day .
that &apos;s not why i did it . i had a good reason .
you can &apos;t stand that i &apos;m getting successful while you &apos;re
flailing around with 15 hours of class and an ex @-@ con .
that &apos;s not true . i couldn &apos;t be more proud of your job at &quot; w. &quot;
i wanted to protect you from seeing
chuck and raina together on valentine &apos;s day .
for the last time , he &apos;s using her .
it &apos;s not real .
it &apos;s just business . how come no one believes me ?
blair .
look , you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna go get him so he can tell you himself .
russell .
ah ! howard .
you &apos;re fired .
what ? on what grounds ?
i mean , i was actually coming over here to quit anyway , but--
you leaked a private document .
granted , that &apos;s exactly what i wanted you to do , but still .
i can &apos;t have someone around i don &apos;t trust .
take care of yourself .
what just happened ?
blair .
i &apos;m looking for chuck . what is this place ?
uh , he built it for raina .
oh . he &apos;s pretty serious about this game .
oh , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s a game . it &apos;s--
raina , i just need five minutes .
i &apos;m only here
because i refuse to make this anyone else &apos;s business .
look , i &apos;m sorry you had to witness that scene with lily .
i &apos;m not the one you need to apologize to .
you went behind lily &apos;s back . you disrespected her .
is this what you do-- wonderful things
for people you care about before you turn on them ?
look , you put family before all else . i can &apos;t do that .
my father was never there for me .
my mother abandoned and betrayed me .
my uncle is my worst enemy .
but maybe your father isn &apos;t as perfect as you think .
what are you saying ?
he &apos;s the reason i went after lily .
he pitted me against her .
so you &apos;re trying to turn me against him ?
destroy my relationship ?
nothing is sacred to you .
that &apos;s not true . you are sacred to me .
until i do something you don &apos;t like
and you turn on me , too .
give me a chance to show you that &apos;s not who i am .
please
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve seen all i needed to see .
rubies are red . hydrangeas are blue .
chuck &apos;s given his heart away ...
wow , he &apos;s good .
but guess what , blair ? not to you .
shut up , humphrey .
they &apos;re not richart ,
称为世界上最美的巧克力
but they &apos;re all i could find at this hour .
i was gonna leave them on your pillow .
blair , please , it &apos;s been a long night . i &apos;m tired .
you were right .
chuck and raina are real .
were real , anyway .
i know that chocolates from duane reade
won &apos;t make it any better , but ... i &apos;m so sorry .
well , maybe i made the wrong decision
in going to raina first instead of you ,
but i was worried about your heart ,
not your job .
i knew that you &apos;d bounce back stronger than ever at &quot; w. &quot;
you may be right . donna texted me .
she said your profile &apos;s gonna be amazing .
well , i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m not thrilled you got an &quot; a &quot; -plus
at ben &apos;s expense .
after mentioning i &apos;d stumbled
across some incriminating facebook photos ,
the interviewer wisely agreed to redact
the ben part of the article .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d really appreciate that
if he ever speaks to me again .
you &apos;re gonna be okay alone ?
not yet , but i need to start learning to be .
go have fun with your parolee .
maybe it &apos;s a secret valentine .
hello ?
why the hell would you do that ?
well , this way , i can initiate a whole new round
of pestering you to submit it .
but i already did ... yesterday .
i gave your article to a junior editor
at &quot; vanity fair , &quot; not &quot; details . &quot;
i &apos;m assuming that won &apos;t be a problem ?
wait . so you submitted it without reading ?
of course i read it .
i have a reputation to uphold .
and you still put me through the wringer ?
it was ... good .
mm , i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;d you just say ?
you heard me . it was ... sharp
and well observed .
when it comes to experiencing an ex with a new love ,
you have some insight .
mm . how--how are you doing with all that ?
uh ... just seeking refuge
with the perfect anti @-@ valentine &apos;s day movie --
&quot; rosemary &apos;s baby . &quot;
what part are you at ? i &apos;ll watch with you .
forgive me if i &apos;ve memorized
some of ruth gordon &apos;s dialogue .
uh , okay , all of it .
it just started .
lesson learned .
&quot; wall street &quot; didn &apos;t need a sequel --
in the theaters or in my life .
now i just have to find something between manual labor
and high finance .
wish i &apos;d been wrong about thorpe .
wish i had a company i could put you in .
now one good thing i realized tonight --
i still got game .
as soon as russell fired me , i had to turn over my key card .
so i gave him one ...
to the gym at the empire .
this ...
is to thorpe &apos;s office .
and this ...
all the passwords you need .
they change them weekly on thursdays ,
so that should give you a good 48 hours .
good luck .
way to go .
a valentine can be a red @-@ hot weapon of revenge ...
or a heartfelt apology .
thanks for comin &apos; .
i should &apos;ve told you i was waitering .
i should have owned it .
well , i should &apos;ve given you the chance
and not put words in your mouth .
hey . it &apos;s still valentine &apos;s day for ... another ten minutes .
maybe we can share &apos;em together ?
i made enough money tonight to buy us some beers .
sounds great ... except for the beer part .
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day . we should have champagne .
well , have you ever heard of a black velvet ?
that is champagne mixed with beer .
uh , delicious ... or not .
serena .
i just came over to thank you
for saying all those nice things to us the other night ...
my point is , paranoia can save your life .
oh , so she was supposed to know
that her husband was gonna sell their firstborn to a coven ?
the woman couldn &apos;t be more naive .
i mean , who eats unsolicited desserts ?
mm , point taken . the -- the mousse was creepy .
do you know how many gloves i &apos;ve lost on the subway ?
well , you do often seem cursed .
i do , don &apos;t i ?
or sometimes
there &apos;s a way to candy @-@ coat the fact you &apos;re all alone .
you know , i got more hugs tonight from strangers
than my grandmother &apos;s doled out my entire life ,
which i guess is comforting ,
but it &apos;s not exactly valentine &apos;s day .
no , but you still might get one .
a guy came by earlier and asked for you .
cute guy , brown hair .
said you &apos;d know who he was .
he &apos;s waiting around the corner .
have fun .
well , then i &apos;ll -- i &apos;m gonna ... go ...
yeah . and , uh ...
thank you , eric .
jonathan ?
miss me ?
okay , look , i want nothing to do with you ,
all right , damien ?
you think i wanted dan and nate to rat me out to my own father ?
now i &apos;m under a microscope , and that is a big , big problem .
yeah , that &apos;s an occupational hazard .
listen to me . you &apos;re not understanding what i &apos;m saying .
it &apos;s also a problem for you .
remember when you had all that stuff on your mind
when we first started hanging out together--
what you told me about your mom and ben ?
perjury is a felony ,
and , well ,
lily could be spending a lot of time in jail
if , say , i were to ... tell everybody .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
but whatever your valentine &apos;s day brings ,
never forget that some years ,
it &apos;s a massacre .
