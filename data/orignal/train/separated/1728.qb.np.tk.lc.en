第七季 第六集
what are you working on ?
can &apos;t talk . in the zone .
do you know what he &apos;s doing ?
could be anything .
last time he was like this ,
he figured out electron transport in graphene .
the time before that , he was making a list
of who &apos;s allowed in his tree fort if he ever gets one .
still can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t make the cut .
uh , sheldon , you want to take a break ?
your food &apos;s ready .
no , no , what are you doing ?
he &apos;s both happy and quiet .
it &apos;s like seeing a unicorn and bigfoot at the same time .
sorry we &apos;re so late .
bernadette got stuck at work .
great news !
a raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier
and now can infect humans !
why is that great news ?
in the pharmaceutical business , we have a saying :
&quot; mo &apos; infections , mo &apos; money . &quot;
wait !
maybe you want to wash
your little raccoon hands first .
oh , calm down .
if i had it , i &apos;d be dead already .
guys , listen up .
can &apos;t listen , zone .
also don &apos;t care .
next week is the anniversary of my first date with bernadette .
really don &apos;t care .
i want to do something special ,
and i was hoping you guys could be a part of it .
aw , what horrible thing are you trying to make up for ?
just putting something in the bank
for what horrible thing i do next .
look , she &apos;s gonna be back any second , so here &apos;s the deal :
i &apos;m writing a song , and i was hoping
we could all play it for her together .
oh , i love that .
that is so beautiful .
sheldon ?
when did we get to the cheesecake factory ?
it &apos;s really sweet what howard wants to do for bernadette .
yeah .
hey , how come you &apos;ve never done anything romantic
to celebrate our first date ?
well , for starters , you &apos;ve broken up with me so many times ,
which first date are we talking about ?
ooh , somebody call the burn ward .
and back to the zone .
and besides , i do romantic things for you all the time .
can you even name one romantic thing you &apos;ve done for me ?
i can name tons .
sex doesn &apos;t count .
i know , what about that bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast ?
well , i took you there .
all you did was ...
i know what i did .
i bet they had to throw out that rocking chair .
you know , i can be romantic if i want to .
it &apos;s fine .
and also not true .
okay , just you wait and see .
i &apos;m gonna romance your freakin &apos; ass off .
that &apos;s beautiful .
is that shakespeare ?
sheldon ?
zone .
he &apos;ll figure it out when he falls off the roof .
sheldon , i know you &apos;re in the zone ,
but do you want some tea ?
all right , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this ,
but you haven &apos;t spoken in hours
and i &apos;m starting to get worried .
please say something .
leonard , prepare to be humbled
and weep at the glory of my genius .
nope , it was better before .
look at it .
i feel like my mind just made a baby .
and it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s not like human babies ,
which are loud and covered in goop .
holy crap , sheldon ,
did you just figure out a method
for synthesizing a new stable super @-@ heavy element ?
did i ?
well , that can &apos;t be right .
no one &apos;s ever done that before .
except me , because i just did it !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
sheldon and his brain ...
yeah , definitely better before .
so i &apos;m almost done writing the song for bernadette .
are you cool playing the cello ?
if by &quot; cool &quot; you mean &quot; willing to , &quot; yes .
if by &quot; cool &quot; you mean &quot; cool , &quot;
clearly you &apos;ve never seen me play the cello .
great . will you play the ukulele ?
of course . i &apos;d be happy to shred it on my ax .
or you could just play your tiny , ridiculous guitar .
fine . i will melt her heart .
and her face !
gentlemen .
uh , no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough .
now , if your plan
is to hoist me on your shoulders
and carry me around the cafeteria , please refrain .
i don &apos;t care for heights , motion sickness
or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks .
seriously , congratulations , sheldon .
yeah , i read your paper online .
that technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired .
oh , well , thank you .
believe it or not ,
i just learned a chinese research team
at the hubei institute for nuclear physics
ran a test on a cyclotron ,
and the results were extremely promising .
sheldon , that &apos;s incredible .
yeah , i know !
they called it the greatest thing since the communist party .
although i &apos;m pretty sure that
the communist party made them say that .
i like china .
see , they know how to keep people in line .
so , what happens next ?
oh , more testing , more success , more fame .
but don &apos;t worry ,
i will remain the same down @-@ to @-@ earth humble joe
i &apos;ve always been .
good to know .
yeah .
now give me that cookie ;
i discovered an element .
thank you so much for coming .
you called the right person .
i believe i have the perfect romantic evening
for you to give leonard .
okay , good , &apos; cause i &apos;ve been really struggling with this .
as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware ,
the quickest way to a man &apos;s heart is through his ...
pants , but leonard says sex doesn &apos;t count .
you poor thing .
you have one arrow in your quiver ,
and you just can &apos;t use it .
fortunately , another pathway to a man &apos;s heart
is through his stomach .
i don &apos;t know if i want to cook for him ;
he &apos;s kind of a picky eater .
i mean , &quot; it &apos;s too salty .
it &apos;s too dry .
it &apos;s too burnt and frozen at the same time . &quot;
wait , come on ,
what else would sweep you off your feet ?
well , i &apos;ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing .
the sexual chemistry
between my partner and me is electric .
but boy , oh , boy ,
does my father not approve
until he sees us in the big dance competition .
okay , that &apos;s just the plot for dirty dancing .
what else would you love ?
other than being lifted over patrick swayze &apos;s head .
oh ! oh , uh , you could , uh , stand outside his window
with a boom box in the air .
that &apos;s from say anything .
look , i &apos;m a lonely guy ; i watch a lot of movies .
look , penny , if you truly want to be romantic ,
it needs to come from you .
i get that , but why is this so hard ?
well , you &apos;ve probably never had to do this stuff
&apos;cause you &apos;re young and beautiful
and men have always thrown themselves at you .
yeah , i &apos;m trying to be sad about that .
i can &apos;t .
let &apos;s see , what &apos;s next ?
okay ! here .
this is the magic marker
i was using when i made the discovery .
i don &apos;t think the smithsonian &apos;s gonna want your marker .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re not on a list for my tree fort .
ooh , guess who &apos;s getting an article
written about him in physics today ?
i &apos;ll give you a hint .
you measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday .
sheldon , i &apos;m so proud of you .
well , you should be .
my discovery is spreading like wildfire .
unlike my mole , which is holding steady
at the size of a navy bean .
what &apos;s next ?
this is the very copy
of the handbook of chemistry and physics
in which i looked up the reaction rates
of mendelevium and ...
and what ?
no .
no , no , no , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve made a horrible mistake .
what are you talking about ?
this table-- it &apos;s in square centimeters .
i read it as square meters .
you know what that means ?
that americans can &apos;t handle the metric system ?
amy , i was off by a factor of 10,000 .
but the chinese team found the element .
yeah , well , they shouldn &apos;t have .
my calculations were wrong .
there must be some resonance
between the elements i didn &apos;t know about .
so you just got lucky ?
sheldon cooper does not get lucky !
you and me both , brother .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the element was found because of you ,
and that &apos;s groundbreaking .
what matters is
the greatest scientific achievement of my life
is based on a blunder .
i &apos;m not a genius , i &apos;m a fraud .
you know , sheldon , in neuroscience ,
we &apos;re forever finding something in one part of the brain
that we thought was someplace else .
oh , great .
now i &apos;m worse than a fraud .
i &apos;m practically a biologist .
you got to stop beating yourself up over this .
i mean , you made a mistake , but it was a happy mistake .
there &apos;s nothing happy about it .
i &apos;m being given credit that i don &apos;t deserve .
oh , people get things they don &apos;t deserve all the time .
look at me with you .
no , leonard , this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life .
every science classroom ,
every periodic table , every textbook--
this mistake will be staring back at me
like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows .
i &apos;ve got to find a way to stop this thing .
buddy , i don &apos;t think you can .
i mean , once it &apos;s out there , it &apos;s out there .
this thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape .
you know , frankly , i &apos;d prefer a sex tape .
you don &apos;t know what a sex tape is , do you ?
no .
make sure you guys get to the restaurant by 8 : 00 .
bernadette &apos;s meeting me there at 8 : 30
and i don &apos;t want to blow the surprise .
we &apos;ll be there .
got it .
now , uh , i have a question about the song .
i was thinking at some point
i could bust out a little rap .
n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ no ...
come on , come on , you haven &apos;t even heard it yet .
leonard , give me a beat .
i will not .
please ?
no , i want this to be romantic .
it will be !
i don &apos;t call anyone a ho ,
and the only time i use the phrase &quot; my bitch , &quot;
i &apos;m referring to you .
there he is !
stop it .
stop celebrating me !
and no woos !
oh , not you , dr. woo . you &apos;re fine .
i want you all to know
that you have no reason to applaud me .
my so @-@ called breakthrough
wasn &apos;t the result of my genius .
it was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake .
so please refrain
from praising me for it in the future .
wh ... i don &apos;t understand .
they didn &apos;t find the element ?
oh , no , they found the element .
no , no , stop it !
i don &apos;t need to take this admiration
from the likes of you people !
how do i make them stop loving me ?
invite them to live with us .
boy , bernadette is gonna love this .
yeah .
it must be nice to have someone do something so romantic .
okay , you know what &apos;s not romantic ?
rubbing it in someone &apos;s face .
actually , it can be ,
but i told you sex doesn &apos;t count .
i &apos;m getting worried about bernadette .
i &apos;m gonna call and check on her .
the national science foundation
wants to give me a substantial grant .
oh , that &apos;s a big deal .
i know .
when will this nightmare end ?
hey , i get that you feel bad about all the attention ,
but still , what you did is amazing .
we &apos;re really proud of you .
i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re not ?
sheldon , i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
and you &apos;re right .
you don &apos;t deserve any credit .
all you did was misread some numbers on a table .
a very easy table , too .
honestly , i &apos;m embarrassed for you .
that &apos;s the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
damn it , everyone &apos;s better at this than me .
congratulations , dr. fowler .
you just made the fort .
guys , there w @-@ was an accident at bernie &apos;s lab .
oh , my god , is she okay ?
yeah , but she &apos;s at the hospital in quarantine .
what ?
poor bernadette .
i hate to pile on the bad news , but i just got a raise .
oh , my god , bernie , what happened ?
well , let &apos;s just say the next time you move
a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge ,
make two trips .
you &apos;re sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s just a precaution .
if there was a problem ,
i &apos;d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now .
sorry i messed up our date .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
i brought the date here .
guys , come on in .
what &apos;s all this ?
well , tonight is the anniversary of our first date ,
and i wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you .
howie .
sheldon , get over here !
she might be contagious .
don &apos;t you think i &apos;m having a rough enough day ?

look , i &apos;m shaking .
she &apos;s sick , i knew it . bye !
i have to say ,
this is the best top ramen you &apos;ve ever made .
i discovered a secret ingredient :
the flavor packet .
that sucker is well named .
all right , lover boy .
get ready , &apos; cause there is a crap storm of romance
coming your way .
stop it , you &apos;re gonna make me cry .
all right . you seem pretty confident .
oh , i am .
maybe if you follow this trail ,
you &apos;ll see why .
oh , rose petals .
yes .
the most beautiful
and shockingly expensive of all the flowers .
you made the bed ?
you really are pulling out all the stops .
okay , i gave this a lot of thought ,
and i finally found something to show you
how much i love you .
it &apos;s a first edition of
hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy .
i remember it was your favorite book growing up .
this is great .
it ... thank you .
it &apos;s ... so much .
what ?
nothing . i love it .
no .
something &apos;s going on . what &apos;s wrong with it ?
i remember you saying how great it would be
to have a first edition .
it &apos;s true , i @-@ i did .
i did say that ...
when we were at the used bookstore together
and i saw the first edition and i bought it .
oh , my god , i am the worst !
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s really thoughtful .
no , it &apos;s not ! i mean ...
what &apos;s thoughtful is everything you do .
here , you know what ? look at this .
look , here &apos;s the ... the plane ticket you bought me
when i was too poor to go home for the holidays .
and the rose you left on my windshield ...
just because .
here &apos;s the @-@ the thank @-@ you letter you wrote me
after the first time i slept with you .
all 11 pages of it .
can &apos;t believe you saved all this stuff .
of course i did .
it &apos;s you .
come here .
is that a pregnancy test ?
oh , yeah , just the first one .
i didn &apos;t save them all .
i can &apos;t believe i read this table wrong .
i blame you .
me ? what did i do ?
you distract me .
i &apos;ve been distracted since the moment i met you .
sorry .
well , you should be .
because all i can think about
is how much i want to kiss you .
and not just on the cheek , but on the mouth .
like mommies and daddies do .
oh , sheldon .
amy ?
amy .
did you hear what i said ?
can &apos;t talk , in the zone .
