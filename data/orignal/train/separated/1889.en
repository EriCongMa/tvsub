In order to properly treat a problem,
a surgeon needs as much information as she can get.
Wasn't this stupid thing supposed to start already?
So we ask questions.
Questions like...
"When did the pain begin?"
It started about 45 minutes ago.
"Have you experienced these symptoms before?"
"Do you have a family history?"
"Are you currently sexually active?"
"Have you recently undergone surgery?"
If you're unwilling or unable
to answer these and other questions,
we're forced to rely on tests for insight.
It's possible that I may have, by mistake,
said that if she had any doubts, she should flee.
What?
She was nervous.
How nervous?
How nervous was she, callie?
Until those test results come back...
There's nothing we can do but wait.
Ah, damn it.
What is it?
There's too much bleeding.
Look, even with the scope, I can't see a damn thing.
Okay. Uh, let's get a C.T. And call the O.R.
I want them ready the second we know what we're dealing with.
Should I call anyone else?
You're going into surgery. You'll be a while.
Yeah?
Dr. Bailey.
I didn't forget.
I know that. Should I call your fiance?
Y-yes, please.
What does this mean?
I don't know.
The lawsuit is...
Maybe...
Maybe we'll be fine.
Maybe we can--
Look, just--could we not talk about that?
Not right now.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?
Um, my beautiful wife-to-be
has been pulled into an emergency surgery,
so things are gonna be delayed for a little while.
Those of you who are doctors will understand.
And those who aren't, uh...
Well, they're setting up the buffet,
the bar's open in the back.
Drink, eat, and just as soon as we're able,
we'll have a little wedding.
That poor handsome fool.
Bailey's probably hopped a boxcar to mexico by now.
I am the worst maid of honor ever.
Who made you maid of honor?
I called it.
And then I tanked it.
Uh, I'm--I'm gonna go to the hospital.
Right now?
I'll go. I'm the general surgeon.
Maybe I can tag her out of surgery.
Put this in water till I get back.
You really told Bailey to run?
I didn't say she should run.
I said she could run.
And--and I was joking. I was... ha ha.
Funny... funny me.
Who needs a drink?
I can stay.
We'll be fine. You should go.
I don't really feel like going to a wedding
if I'm gonna be signing divorce papers.
I don't know what happened.
I heard a crash, checked my rearview.
Half the club is eating asphalt,
banging around like tenpins.
I mean, it's real, real nasty.
Bowling for bikers?
Maybe you should stick around.
Yeah.
You just gonna stand there with your junk in your hand,
or you gonna do something, doc?
第九季 第十集
Multiple contusions. Pelvis stabilized in transport.
Coming through. Watch your back.
You know, I used to ride a donor cycle.
Really? Why'd you stop?
Chest tubes hurt like a bitch.
Stuart Loeb, 35. Vital signs stable.
Alert before we pushed 5 of morphine
for a left arm degloving injury.
Ooh. He must have been thrown out of his car.
He was on one of the bikes.
Seriously, this guy?
I know, right?
Okay. Uh, let's get him in trauma 1.
And start making some calls.
We need more hands in here.
Right away, doctor.
Hey, look at these.
Macaroni and cheese in the form of a cupcake.
Might be the cutest thing I've ever seen.
I just... did something.
I got us a room. Just now.
Um, a-and the guy at the desk said that it's really nice
and it has a view.
Though honestly, I only care that it has a bed.
Are you tired?
No.
You got us a room.
Yes.
S-so we could...
Yes.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry, but if you knew, you'd understand.
What is she doing?
Wait. Okay. Hold on. Listen.
We should take some of that to go.
You know, in case we work up an appetite.
Right.
I'm so sorry.
You're sorry? No, you're not sorry.
You're criminally negligent.
Dr. Webber--
My wife has Alzheimer's,
and you told me my visits were agitating her.
So instead of monitoring her myself,
I allowed you to do it.
You want to look at me right now and tell me you're sorry?
Sir, I understand you're upset.
Though to be clear,
when I said you should visit less frequently,
I certainly didn't mean for you to stop altogether.
What did you just say to me?
What did you just say to me?!
Dr. Webber, they need you in O.R. two.
Thank you.
Don't thank me. Just go.
Is she in the O.R. already?
I don't know.
I just said that so you wouldn't punch that guy out.
Is this why she isn't at the wedding?
Oh, god. The wedding.
I'm gonna go find her. Are you okay?
Yeah, go. Go.
According to the article,
the doctors discovered that her hair follicles
had actually been growing nails instead of hair.
Like fingernails.
Cool story, bro.
Can I get anybody a coffee?
Mnh-mnh.
No.
It's like having dinner with "Ripley's believe it or not!"
So you're starting to regret this whole "Let's bring dates" idea?
No.
No. I love "Ripley's believe it or not!"
I love easy wedding sex,
which I'm gonna miss out on now
'cause you jerks can't keep your hands off each other.
You made me bring sand to the beach,
and it's sand I can't sleep with.
Since when can you not sleep with interns?
I'm a homeowner now. I've grown up.
Besides, they get all hung up and sad
when you don't want to be their boyfriend.
It's not worth the hassle.
You are one classy guy, Karev.
I make an effort.
He was just trying to be nice,
and I got him in trouble with his boss.
I can barely look him in the eye.
Dr. Avery has nice eyes.
Do you think they're blue or green... or both?
Don't. Don't you dare sleep with him.
I'm not. Why not?
'cause that's the kind of thing Leah would do.
You want to be like Leah?
Oh, gross. No.
Besides, he's probably not even interested.
Of course he's interested.
Interns are like sexual catnip at this hospital.
Look at me. I was enjoying a perfectly healthy
teacher-student relationship with Kepner,
and now she's all over me.
I brought notes so I can keep the conversation about medicine,
but she keeps asking me all these personal questions,
and I'm running out of cards.
Did you just get paged? Both of you?
All of us.
Big trauma back at the ranch. You kids coming?
Yes, indeed.
Yeah, I'm coming, too.
Nope. Uh, you don't get to practice medicine
with booze in your system, hobo jo.
You're hobo jo?
Like "Rides the rails and eats beans from a can"?
I don't--I don't know. Weird.
Shane, you can ride with me.
A beer for me and another round for hobo jo.
You got it.
Let me guess. Thunderbird
or is it just, uh, straight paint thinner?
I told your fiance it was an emergency.
But not who the patient was?
Should I have?
No, no. He'd just send everybody home.
I am still getting married today.
What are you doing here?
Oh, tell me he didn't call it off.
No one called anything off. I'm here to help.
What's the situation?
Oh, well, uh, C.T. shows an aortic aneurysm so big,
it's torn into the duodenum.
I've never seen one that big.
Yeah, me neither. Scrub fast.
Chief, where do you need us?
Just a second, Avery.
Guess Dr. Bailey beat us to the fun.
Dr. Bailey's here?
She and Dr. Grey are working on Adele Webber in O.R. One.
Dr. Webber's wife?
Should we--
You have a degloving injury in trauma 1.
Take care of your patient.
Let Bailey and Grey take care of theirs.
Don't touch me!
Dr. Hunt, a little help, please.
You come at me with that thing again,
and you will not like where it ends up.
You two make the rounds.
I want status reports on all the injured,
and find out what happened out there.
You two aren't going anywhere except the waiting room.
And, ma'am, you need to sit back.
Don't call me "Ma'am."
It's Gasoline.
And you don't want to get in the way of club business.
You screw with one of us,
and we will all screw with you.
Okay.
You want your guys taken care of?
That's all my guys are trying to do.
Now I'll let these gentlemen conduct their investigation
as long as they do not bother
any of my patients.
And you settle down
and let Dr. Brooks here do her job.
Deal.
How's Gasoline
And the Hammer?
These are people?
Yeah. Those are their road names.
You get to pick your road names,
and you went with Stuart?
I'm not officially in the club.
They let me hang around, ride along with them.
It has been
the greatest time of my entire life.
And I ruined it.
That crash was my fault.
My sister was right.
I had no business being on that bike.
I think your arm would agree.
I don't know.
I think guys on motorcycles are hot.
All right, Stuart, your injuries are extensive,
but I do think it's possible we can salvage your hand.
We're just gonna get you up to the O.R.
and debride your arm.
Edwards, you're with me.
Un-unless you'd rather I took Dr. Ross.
Are you kidding? No. Sh-shane's my guy.
Nice.
Nice view.
Open or closed?
Closed.
Uh, lights-- on or off?
Um... whichever.
How about...
That's great.
Um, I'm sorry. I just...
suddenly got so nervous.
Me, too.
Really?
Oh. Okay, hold on.
Okay. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Um... I think I should take the leg off first.
Of course. Yeah. I can help if--
No, no, no.
Um, velcro straps and plastic sockets aren't exactly sexy,
and I wanted this evening to be all about sexy,
so I think that I need to take the leg off myself.
And I need you not to watch.
Oh, you want me to go in the bathroom
until your leg's off and you're under the covers?
Would you?
Okay.
Sure.
Murphy, get your hands in here.
Dr. Bailey.
I need you to put pressure on the aorta,
there under the diaphragm.
It's just a stopgap
until we can mobilize the duodenum
off the aneurysm.
Um, Grey.
Murphy, I got this.
Go up in the gallery and sit with him.
Okay.
Uh, have you got a little brown paper bag you can put that in?
Would you stop?
I had no parents. I lived in my car.
So, yes, I have trust issues. Comes with the territory.
You need to stop acting like you're the only person
who ever had a crappy childhood.
Yeah? How many foster homes did you get kicked out of
before you moved in to your car?
Uh, 17.
And I didn't live in my car. I went to juvie.
Stop making fun of me.
I'm not.
Really?
And you're actually lucky that your folks abandoned you.
Means you didn't have to watch your schizo mom
go after your baby brother with a steak knife.
Fine. Fair.
But you never woke up in the middle of the night
with junkies banging on your bedroom windshield,
praying they'd get tired or bored
before they put a rock through a window.
No, I didn't, because the junkie was my dad,
and he didn't break windows, just fingers.
Well, did you ever have foster parents
that made you and 19 other kids
sleep on cots in the basement...
Locking the doors at lights out,
so that if you had to pee in the middle of the night
you had to use buckets they set up along the wall?
Buckets you couldn't see
because if you turned the lights on,
the bigger kids would hold you down
and take those buckets and...
No. Never.
Me neither.
Saw it in a movie on cable.
How did you get cable in your car?
I don't live in my car anymore, jerk.
Stuart?
He went down first. Everybody else followed.
Emily Bennett?
Oh, the last person that called me that
is somewhere choking on a tire iron.
Excuse me.
G-gasoline?
Uh, I'm Dr. Yang.
Dr. Brooks found that you have some fluid around your heart.
So I would like to do a pericardiocentesis
to relieve that pressure.
No, thanks. You've see my x-rays.
My body's 85% metal.
I get over stuff.
Well, you just don't get over this.
Untreated, you could die.
Treated I'm stuck in a bed.
No dice, Dr. Yang.
I can't be out of commission,
not when my boys need me to take care of business.
Actually, they brought a guy in with us--Stuart.
Have you seen him?
No.
I'll tell you what--
You find him, you take me to see him...
and then I'll let you do whatever you want.
Ow! Damn it, kid.
There's no way you're doing that right.
Call the redhead over here.
There's no need to--
no, no, I ain't gonna suffer
just because you're avoiding your old lady.
My what?
I seen the way she looks at you.
She's not looking at me.
Not now. Now she's ignoring you,
which means she really digs you.
Ow! Damn it!
What is going on?
This kid's a menace, that's what.
Okay.
Sir, just calm down. This is a teaching hospital.
All right?
Just...
allow me to assist Dr. Ross with his technique, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right, so for a corner stitch like this,
it's usually best to use
a half-buried horizontal mattress stitch.
So you go in like that...
Okay. I think I got it.
I mean...
It--it's like this, right?
Yes. Great work.
You're such a quick study. Keep it up.
Keep it up.
Her aorta is like a rock.
I don't know how we're gonna sew in this graft.
Where is this bleeding coming from?
I'm not sure. Hold pressure.
You should be down there watching what they're doing.
I can see from here.
Primary aortoduodenal fistulas--
they almost never happen.
Why not?
This usually would present as a kind of pulsating mass.
Something like that, a patient wouldn't wait to seek treatment.
The--the fistula would never develop.
With Alzheimer's,
they don't remember if they told anyone.
Someone should've been there...
paying attention.
You should be down there.
Sir, respectfully, I am not going down there.
You should stop asking.
The proximal clamp
fractured the atherosclerotic plaque.
We have to get above the bleeding.
What are they doing now?
Aneurysms like these are caused by
a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque.
Their clamp broke off a chunk
of one of these plaques
and that aorta opened right back up.
They think they'll be able to move the clamp up higher
and control the bleeding,
but they're already up to the superior mesenteric artery.
There isn't any place left for them to go.
I don't understand. What does that mean?
It means, they've just about run out of options.
I don't know what else to do.
Just wait. Just-- just a minute. Just a minute.
Is there anyone I can call for you?
Bailey.
Try dividing the renal vein.
That might get you above the fractured plaque.
But she's exsanguinating. I don't think--
Just try it!
Okay. Scalpel.
Here you go, doctor.
Hey. Hey. Are you...
Hey. Look, I was kidding.
Come on. That wasn't even the worst thing I said.
Oh, god. Please.
You're not a garbage eater, okay? I'm sorry.
Oh-ho, look at your face.
Ah, I got you. I so got you.
What?
Tears, baby.
The number one tool of the street kid.
Turn on the water works, you can get out of anything.
Wait, wait. You--you can just cry like that?
Got three surgeries out of you, chump.
Oh, come on. That's not fair.
Chicks can get away with junk like that.
That would never work for me.
You're wrong.
A girl crying is one thing,
but a guy crying freaks everybody out.
Really?
For sure.
Show me how.
Coming up.
Hello.
Hey, you're awake.
No, not really.
Oh, sorry.
I just--I wanted to check your post-op vitals.
How's your B.P.?
You know who would know that would be a nurse.
Why don't you call a nurse?
Right. I'll do that.
Why are you whispering?
Oh, I'm in a hotel bathroom.
And I'm about to have sex...
for the first time in months.
I'm hanging up now.
Oh, okay. Well, rest up.
I, uh, decided to take a bath,
which you're gonna appreciate...
'cause I smell amazing.
I'm sorry, Callie. I'm...
I wanted to be spontaneous and fun.
But I...
I can't.
And I'm so sorry, Callie.
I'm--I...
I'm--I'm not...
I'm not ready.
Please don't be mad.
What are you doing?
Calling room service. We're gonna need champagne
to go with our mac and cheese cupcakes.
What?
Uh, sorry.
It's just...
your technique-- it's kind of beautiful.
It's Dr. Sloan's technique, actually.
But I am pretty good at it.
Here. You try.
Okay.
Hey, uh, just, uh, checking in.
What's the story?
Uh, S-Stuart's afraid he's not gonna be able to ride anymore
because he wiped out and hit chicken Bill,
and chicken Bill hit Roach-clip, who ended up
taking out gasoline, the hammer, and blue corner Pete--
Medically.
I meant what's the story medically?
Well, his limb is still viable.
And we're almost done with the debridement.
So as soon as he heals up,
I will get him back in here for a skin graft.
Mm. That sounds good.
Thank you.
I think I'll take it from here.
Okay. Definitely.
You need to stop.
You are not gross and you are not Karev.
Owen.
Oh, Cristina, I'm sorry.
I haven't had two seconds to think about--
Oh, uh, no, me either.
Um, actually, I wasn't looking for you.
Is Avery still in there with Stuart?
Yeah. Why?
Oh, my patient needs a pericardiocentesis,
and she won't let me touch her
until I take her to see him.
Let me guess. We're talking about gasoline?
You know gasoline?
Oh, we go way back. A couple of hours ago,
she threatened to have me beaten senseless.
Sounds like her. What a doll.
Wait.
She wants to get close to Stuart?
Yeah. What?
I need you to page security
and have them meet me in the ER as soon as possible.
Right away, doctor.
Owen, what?
Where the hell did she go?
Stuart's the reason they all crashed.
You screw with one of them, they all screw with you.
We don't keep any tire irons around, do we?
We need to find her. Now.
They're sewing in the graft now.
Onto the aorta?
Yes.
What's her BP.?
100 over 60.
Heart rate?
98.
What's happening, sir?
Dr. Webber?
It's working.
It's working.
Don't you freakin' touch me!
Move your ass or he'll move it for you!
Gasoline, this wasn't our deal.
Shove your deal.
You cagers wouldn't let me see Stuart,
and now my guys find out he had to have surgery?
I need to see him now!
He is one of us and he's hurt
and he might freakin' die,
and I need to see him!
What did you do with the room key?
The room key?
Oh, come on!
I gave you the room key before we left the freakin' room.
No, you didn't.
Did you?
You do this all the time.
You did this last week
with the check for Becky's piano lesson.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
What's the problem?
I lost the key to our room.
Look... I'm sorry.
It's been a very long day.
And, uh, obviously we...
are both very drunk.
Oh, no. Uh, uh, wh-- what's your room number?
220.
Uh-huh. Uh, Jordan Shouse?
That's it.
There.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I think that every food should be turned into a cupcake.
Lasagna cupcakes.
Mashed potato cupcakes.
Mm.
Callie.
Please don't run.
What?
It's all been awful.
And I've been awful.
But I'm just starting to feel like myself again.
And I know that not everything
can be about my leg all the time.
And I don't want it to be,
but right now, it just...
It is.
But I can't lose you.
So please...
don't run.
After the car accident...
you never left my side.
Not once.
There's no way I'm leaving yours.
What would you say to
a good old-fashioned junior-high make out?
Thank god you were there.
You saved her life.
I almost got her killed, leaving her in that place.
You did what you thought was best.
No, I did what I was told.
I never thought it was best.
It won't happen again.
Miranda.
You have to get going.
Oh.
Go.
Richard.
You came.
You're here.
I'm here, baby.
Stay with me.
Just stay.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here.
Hey.
Hey.
Promise me you won't put me in a home
if I get alzheimer's.
You okay?
Yeah. Just promise me.
I promise.
Thank you.
Insert the needle just below the xiphoid.
Good.
That's good.
Dragging her all over the hospital
wasn't the best idea.
You've met her.
How well do you think it goes when I say no?
You're gonna need to explain Stuart.
He's our accountant.
Got us on a group health plan,
helped us set up a Christmas toy drive.
He wanted to ride, so we let him hang around.
Thought it was funny.
Now he's like family.
She got him one of these...
which means he's one of us for life.
If he was gonna die, she wanted him to at least see it.
Have you seen his arm?
Doesn't look like he's gonna get on a bike again.
What do you drive, doc?
Pickup.
Yeah. Figures.
You're a cager.
Whenever you hit the road, you're stuck in a metal box.
But the day you step out of that cage,
say sayonara to your job, your marriage,
or whatever the hell else is boxing you in,
Ah, you'll never give that up.
Oh, I--I'm--I'm coming. I have to get my dress.
Okay, take a breath.
Just, um, I didn't forget.
It was Adele Webber.
I mean, if it was anybody else--
Well, is she okay?
Uh, stable in the I.C.U.
We thought she wasn't gonna make it.
Look, if I'd known it was her, I--
Hey, we're gonna make it.
I don't know what they did with my dress.
Look, Miranda. Miranda, slow down.
Slow down.
Okay, I forgot.
Just for...
like 20 minutes.
We--we were in the trauma room,
and she'd lost so much blood,
and we had to rush up to endoscopy,
and in those 20 minutes,
I forgot...
about you and the wedding.
Somebody had to remind me.
Well, was a person dying?
I mean, really dying, right then?
Well, yeah.
Well, then you're supposed to forget.
Anyway, you were never so crazy about the wedding
in the first place.
Y-yeah, but I--
You were crazy about me, right?
Yeah.
About marrying me?
You were sure about that?
I'm just so scared.
See, I'm--I'm scared that you get it now
only because it was Adele Webber.
And see, and this is not gonna be the last time that I forget,
because I have so many things I want to do,
things I want to be.
See, my ambition it killed my last marriage.
I don't want to do that to you.
Miranda, Miranda, you...
You do know that I'm not at home
waiting around with a roast in the oven?
Yeah. No, I--I'm in Los Angeles,
becoming a surgeon, too.
I-I have things I want to do...
and be.
And--and--and w--
We may only be together five minutes every two months,
but hey, when we do,
we will save every second.
Because we both know
how valuable those five minutes are.
Do you love me?
More than I can hold in my heart.
You're sure about that?
I am completely sure of that.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me,
Even if it is only in... 5-minute increments
every two months?
I do.
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of Washington,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
I am so sorry. I didn't mean--
Hey, you cut that crap out right now.
You didn't do anything.
The hammer saw the whole thing.
That minivan drifted into our lane.
Could've made any one of us wipe out the way you did.
That's right.
Is that mine?
Uh, uh, does this mean that I get my road name?
We were all thinking maybe "Road rash."
God. That's freakin' hard-core.
We missed the whole thing.
Well, maybe she won't notice.
I hope whatever you were doing was worth it,
'cause you're a terrible maid of honor.
Easy, easy, easy.
What did I miss?
Oh, pretty much everything.
And Bailey calling me her maid of honor.
Look at this ring. Did you see the ring?
And we missed the ceremony.
Oh, shoot.
So... mm.
What do we...
I could take you home.
I can't sleep with you.
That's...
not what I was--
It wasn't?
I mean, you're great, it's just that I don't--
I don't sleep with interns.
I don't eith--I mean, I-- I don't sleep with my boss.
Yeah, it's messy.
And I've had enough drama lately, so--
We are entirely on the same page.
Great.
The lawyer sent over the divorce papers.
We don't have to do this right now.
Let's just...
Let's just take a minute
and think about what this means.
I'm done thinking about it, Cristina.
And?
We should never have gotten married in the first place.
When we did, we took something... beautiful,
and we put it in this... box.
And for the last two years, all we have done
is beat against those walls and tear each other apart.
Now we sign these papers...
that ends.
We get out of that box.
We don't hurt each other anymore.
You're gonna want to remember tonight, Shane.
That is what a great night in the E.R. looks like.
We deserve to celebrate.
Let's just get stupid drunk
and dance and--
Dr. Kepner,
I know what you think is gonna happen,
but it can't.
Look, I worked too hard to get into this program
to start... sleeping with my mentor.
So thank you for the interest,
but, no, thank you.
Wh-what makes you think that I want to sleep with you?
You touched my shoulder,
and you brought me wine.
I was being nice,
but you feel that you're being sexually harassed?
No. No, I'm not--no.
O-o-okay, good. Good.
Good. I'm glad that's all cleared up.
So now we can just... have fun.
Cheers.
Where is everybody else?
Oh, Lord.
What? You want me to put it back on?
Are you kidding? Don't ever put it back on.
Oh, sorry.
Wait.
This is so soft.
It's like it's made out of polar bear.
I think this is my room.
What happened to the... mac and cheese cupcakes?
Are you kidding me?
You kept your guests waiting five hours.
Now I saved a woman's life,
you couldn't save me some food?
Y-you...
Go take care of your guests, baby.
You look beautiful.
So I'm--I'm glad you made it.
Now how's her B.P.?
All right. Where's our bride and groom?
Go.
You've been keeping him waiting long enough tonight. Go.
Everybody's been waiting a while for this dance.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for the newlyweds!
The next time you're in your doctor's office,
remember...
she's not asking all those questions for her health,
she's asking them for yours.
You're here?
No.
When?
Tell her everything.
The small details aren't trivial.
They actually make the story.
A little while ago.
What happened?
It was a heart attack.
The surgery fixed the aneurysm, but...
it was too much for her heart.
I-I shouldn't have--
No.
You did everything right.
Everything.
There's no rush.
Take all the time you need.
Start at the beginning.
