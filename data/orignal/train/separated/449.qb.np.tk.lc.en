you scared me .
sorry .
i hit a wall .
whoa , oh . give me a second .
well , our time &apos;s almost up , anyway .
here , let me just show you a couple of cool @-@ down stretches .
next time .
you hired me as your personal trainer , right ?
right .
and here &apos;s your training lesson for today .
next time needs to be now time .
it &apos;s just ... i got some errands to run .
i &apos;ll see you saturday .
terry .
pain is not gain .
got it ?
i got it .
what do you mean , he &apos;s not going ?
every kid loves trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
henry &apos;s scared .
one of his little buddies told him
halloween was the only time when all the real monsters
come out because they can blend in .
never thought about that .
good monster strategy .
you did tell him it wasn &apos;t true , right ?
of course i did . but he &apos;s convinced .
childhood fears are resistant to adult logic .
sometimes you just have to wait it out .
for how long ?
well , if he &apos;s 23 and this still worries you ,
you got a problem .
well , see , the thing is , i think i am partly to blame .
how ?
well , the other night will and i were up late ,
we were having some wine ,
talking about some of the cases we &apos;ve worked on ,
and at one point , i said i felt like there was no end
to all the monsters walking around , and ...
henry sneaked into the room to listen to the grownups .
yeah . we need a cone of silence for our house .
those of you who like a good mystery ,
please unleash your inner agatha christie ,
&apos;cause this one &apos;s a real humdinger .
gary ellard , barry deaver ,
paul hicks , terry rodgers .
over the course of the last month and a half ,
these 4 men have gotten in their cars in la grande , oregon ,
and drove into the never @-@ to @-@ be @-@ seen @-@ againville ,
poof , gone .
the latest victim terry rodgers
disappeared 24 hours ago .
forensic evidence point us anywhere ?
uh , point would imply there is evidence ,
and there is no evidence ,
at least for the first 3 victims .
no forensics , no witnesses , no ransom demands .
maybe these guys just voluntarily decided to hit the road .
4 sudden disappearances in a community this small--
this isn &apos;t about seeking green pastures .
based on last known sightings ,
we &apos;re dealing with a sizeable geographic area .
he &apos;s efficient and well organized .
it &apos;s not easy to make 4 people vanish and stay vanished .
it has been done before , though .
political kidnappings frequently
require holding multiple adults simultaneously .
or they &apos;re already dead . nothing says &quot; can &apos;t be found &quot;
like a shallow grave in the middle of nowhere .
assuming they are alive ,
how is the unsub controlling them ?
and for what purpose ?
the time between abductions is shortening with each victim .
wheels up in 30 .
&quot; i became insane , with long intervals of horrible sanity . &quot;
edgar allan poe .
garcia , anything on the last victim , terry rodgers ?
only that he &apos;s unemployed and
lives in a cabin in the woods .
but primitive , like no flush toilet primitive .
that doesn &apos;t fit the victimology of the other 3 .
ellard coaches track and field at a local college ,
deaver &apos;s a small business owner ,
and hicks is an attorney .
all married with young families .
another difference-- the first 3 victims
were all born and raised in la grande .
terry rodgers only moved to town a couple of months ago .
do you know where from , garcia ?
rhode island . though there &apos;s a 5 @-@ month gap
between terry being in rhode island
and then arriving in oregon .
where he was and what he was doing
is a big fat blank .
it says here that vomit was found in the vicinity of his abduction .
mm . thank you for reminding me
of that disgusting detail , dreamy d.
yes , that vomit has been collected
and is being analyzed as we speak ,
and i &apos;m very grateful that i have this job
and someone has that one that &apos;s not me .
rodgers is the obvious anomaly of the 4,
but there &apos;s no apparent overlap between any of the victims .
almost like the unsub was selecting his targets at random .
blake , you and morgan go talk the the families of the victims .
see if there &apos;s something that links them that &apos;s not on paper .
dave and i will go to the abduction site .
reid , you and jj go to terry rodgers &apos; cabin .
he &apos;s the one we know least about .
maybe he made himself obscure for a reason .
sheriff , i &apos;m agent hotchner .
this is agent rossi .
sheriff colwin .
i am glad to have your help .
the best we can reconstruct it ,
victim &apos;s car veered off the road at a low rate of speed ,
plowed through the fence ,
and ended up in the field .
he managed to get about 20 feet away before throwing up .
the photo showed a second set of tracks .
were you able to pull a tread pattern ?
we &apos;re checking on it right now .
maybe our guy got sick and had to pull over .
or he was forced off the road .
either way , the unsub was following him .
mrs. deaver , did your husband give any indication at all
that something might be wrong the night he disappeared ?
no , not at all .
barry was supposed to coach
our son &apos;s little league game that night .
so he wasn &apos;t depressed , preoccupied ?
nothing .
it was a day like any other day .
this is what happens to other people .
you see it on the news , you know .
give it , what , 30 seconds of your time ?
shake your head , go back to whatever stupid thing you were doing .
washing dishes or putting away laundry .
you never think it &apos;s going to happen to you .
go ahead , you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
sir , i just got the full lab report for the ...
you know , the regur--
for the puke , and there &apos;s no toxins or bacterial infections .
however , terry rodgers did have elevated levels of melatonin
in his system .
and i &apos;m sending you the full lab report ... now ,
on your phones .
elevated ?
his melatonin levels are off the chart .
is that significant ?
it &apos;s a sedative .
an amount this large would induce extreme drowsiness .
do you think he might have overdosed by accident ?
no , no , this was no accident . the victim was drugged .
sheriff , the police report said there were groceries in rodgers &apos; car .
do you know if he ate anything out of the bags ?
he didn &apos;t . we compared the supermarket receipt
to what was in the bags . nothing missing .
so , how did rodgers unknowingly ingest
such a massive dose of melatonin ?
you know , aside from the outhouse ,
this cabin isn &apos;t so primitive .
economics ,
philosophy ,
political theory .
it isn &apos;t exactly breezy , take to the beach reading .
i would , but i don &apos;t really like the beach .
why is that ?
sandy food , pink skin ,
limited and unengaging topography ,
but mostly the drug @-@ resistant bacteria spread by sea gull feces .
sorry i asked .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of material here
about global warming , overcrowding .
the evils of technology .
there &apos;s no phone , no tv .
i wonder what this guy does for fun .
i think maybe i just found the answer .
tread marks were inconclusive .
probably from a pickup truck , though .
what &apos;s that ?
the likely routes our 4 victims took on the day they disappeared .
gary ellard--
apartment , dmv ,
was a no @-@ show for his morning class at eastern oregon university .
barry deaver--home , gas station ,
never made it to his karate group .
paul hicks--home ,
daughter &apos;s preschool , doctor &apos;s appointment .
he was supposed to meet a client over here but never showed .
and we already know about terry rodgers .
and all this tells you what ?
it &apos;s more about what it doesn &apos;t tell us .
none of the lines intersect .
i just had a chat with terry rodgers &apos; personal trainer .
she said he never talked about his private life .
he &apos;s shelling out for a personal trainer ?
this is a guy with no indoor plumbing .
she said he was dedicated .
not in great shape , but dedicated .
hey . you &apos;re talking to the room , p.g.
mm . if by p.g. you mean parental guidance strongly advised ,
i say p.a. , prudent advice .
ok , here &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
i checked all the employees and vendors
and delivery people who work at the supermarket
where terry rodgers bought his groceries ,
and there were no red flags .
also , barry deaver , the second victim ,
i found his car .
where ?
impounded .
it was abandoned 3 weeks ago on fish hatchery road ,
picked up by gus &apos; towing service ,
where it has been collecting dust
and racking up storage fees ever since .
where &apos;s fish hatchery road ?
off the beaten track , like terry rodgers .
looks like the unsub &apos;s hunting grounds are rural and remote .
well , to have ended up there ,
barry deaver must have gone on a diagonal , north first ,
and then headed west towards his karate class .
so , did you learn anything ?
yeah . spence here does not like the beach .
i don &apos;t .
terry rodgers definitely wanted to live off the grid .
a small generator for minimal electrical needs .
no phone , no tv , no radio .
and lots of material about the evils of technology ,
living healthy off the land , that sort of thing .
sounds like the unabomber .
we did find a small stash of marijuana hidden away .
did you find any evidence that a baby lived there or visited there ?
uh , no , why ?
i just got the list of things that he bought at the supermarket .
4 jars of baby food .
a body matching rodgers &apos; description
was found in a river 10 miles out of town .
easy .
easy .
right there .
a fisherman found him washed up on a bank .
well , other than the ligature marks on the wrists and ankles ,
there &apos;s no signs of violence or torture .
a lot of care was taken with the killing and disposing of the body .
sedation and drowning .
we may have to dramatically reassess who the unsub is .
what do you mean ?
we might be looking for a woman .
mommy ?
lexy !
i told you to never come out here by yourself .
i know , but i &apos;m hungry .
stay away from the barn .
there &apos;s a lot of dangerous equipment in there .
you could hurt yourself .
go back to the house and stay there .
i &apos;ll be in to fix you something .
but i mean it-- stay there .
ok .
there &apos;s got to be something else that links these victims .
they were all athletic .
ellard teaches track and field .
deaver has a martial arts studio .
paul hicks had tendonitis from playing competitive tennis .
but rodgers &apos; trainer said that he was out of shape .
did the medical examiner determine rodgers &apos; time of death ?
3 hours from when he was found at the river .
so the unsub kept rodgers alive for the entire day
before drowning him .
go ahead , garcia .
ok . i &apos;ve got something . that &apos;s really bugging me .
i can &apos;t figure out
what terry rodgers was doing those missing 5 months .
i mean , you can &apos;t sit on a park bench in this country
and not leave a paper trail .
but you figured it out .
no . this is me venting .
what i did figure out was what terry rodgers
was doing in rhode island before he went awol . check it .
he was married , divorced , married again ,
currently way behind
on child support payments to wife number two ,
and that &apos;s all i know . so if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have more digging to do .
owes child support
could explain why rodgers vanished for 5 months .
and why he lived off the grid . hard to find .
and that &apos;s what links him to the other victims .
they all fathered children .
we believe the unsub that we &apos;re looking for is a woman ,
who is highly organized ,
she &apos;s thorough , and she &apos;s patient .
based on the complexity and the sophistication of the abductions ,
we think she is most likely between the ages of 30 and 40 .
she &apos;s familiar with the rural area surrounding la grande .
either a native
or someone who &apos;s lived there for a while .
we think she &apos;s keeping her victims in isolation in the countryside ,
which means she has access to land or a structure
that is remote , hidden , and private .
she &apos;s abducting exceptionally health conscious men ,
ideal specimens , if you will .
specimens . for what ?
possible breeding .
ability to father children is something
we think she &apos;s looking for in her victims .
they &apos;re all age appropriate , and they are all fathers .
but why kill the last victim ?
she may have seen him as being flawed .
he was the least physically fit of the 4,
and he neglected to pay child support .
making him undesirable .
the victims may be surrogates
for a man that she wants but she cannot have .
because she killed the last victim ,
we have to consider the possibility
that the unsub is engaged in some sort of elimination process .
preselecting a handful of prime candidates
and then whittling them down one by one
until she has her ideal breeding partner .
and if this is the case , the the killing &apos;s just begun .
mommy , what &apos;s the matter ?
we got a frequent flier .
which one ?
the tomato lady .
i don &apos;t believe this .
dr. gourse .
emma .
thank god you &apos;re here .
those other doctors don &apos;t understand my history .
yeah , i thought we talked about this last time .
yeah , we did .
but the scleroderma came back . look .
there &apos;s nothing on your arm .
but it &apos;s right there .
you treated me after my husband died . it &apos;s the same thing .
yeah , your scleroderma was treated successfully .
you are fine now .
but this could be a mutation .
things mutate .
what about stevens @-@ johnson syndrome ?
stevens @-@ johnson is extremely rare .
and you &apos;d have severe blistering all over your face .
emma , we talked before about how a delusion--
i &apos;m not crazy .
emma , listen to me .
there may be other issues that are going on with you .
did you contact the therapist that i recommended ?
i guess that &apos;s no .
i &apos;m still waiting on the full m.e. report on terry rodgers .
they say they want to retest some of the findings .
did they say why ?
no .
i recognize that scowl , aaron .
what are you thinking ?
something garcia said earlier
about not being able to sit on a park bench in this country
without leaving a paper trail .
and ...
so what if rodgers wasn &apos;t in the country for those 5 months ?
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time someone crossed borders
to get away from troubles .
guys , there &apos;s something interesting about this grocery list .
what ?
look at the items he bought in bulk .
garlic , green tea , vitamin d , ginger .
all of these items are specifically known to boost the immune system .
what if terry rodgers was seriously ill ?
what about the baby food ?
a side effect of radiation treatment is sores inside the mouth .
in fact , doctors advise you to eat the way an infant would eat .
chemotherapy ?
the marijuana in the cabin could have been medicinal .
i &apos;ll have garcia check medical facilities outside the country .
and , reid , you and jj go to the medical examiner
and have them look specifically
for a pre @-@ existing condition with rodgers .
hotch .
you were right .
back in june , rodgers checked himself into
an experimental clinic in mexico .
cancer .
that &apos;s why the unsub disposed of him so quickly .
it was hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
did you find any sedatives in his system ?
the question is ,
what sedatives didn &apos;t we find ?
melatonin , valerian , marijuana ,
hops , catnip , kava @-@ kava ,
bone meal and kelp .
in the victim &apos;s stomach ,
along with some materials that we &apos;re retesting .
take a look at the bottom .
sawdust residue caked in the nostrils ?
not just any sawdust .
pure pinewood pellet sawdust .
it &apos;s usually imported from china .
was it a 0.5 % mixture ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is , it &apos;s not your everyday spread @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor sawdust .
yeah .
that was reid .
they found a half dozen natural sedatives in rogers &apos; system .
i don &apos;t get it .
the unsub &apos;s drugging victims
and trusting that they &apos;ll conk out at the right place at the right time .
why not use a pharmaceutical drug ? or poison ?
which would be quicker and a lot more reliable .
natural holistic elements must be important to her .
she may have health issues of her own .
go ahead , garcia .
i just hit the trifecta , but with two things instead of 3 .
what is that , a bifecta ?
exacta . what do you got ?
well , that ... anyway ,
two missing vehicles not missing anymore .
paul hicks &apos; car
was found by some utility workers an hour ago .
it had rolled off into a ravine .
and gary ellard &apos;s car
was picked up on a speeding violation in coeur d &apos;alene , idaho .
idaho ?
stolen by some local kids 10 days ago in la grande .
car was just sitting by the side of the road ,
keys in the ignition .
they made a typically sound teenage decision ,
decided to take it on a cross @-@ state joyride .
garcia , i need to know
the exact spot where the vehicles were originally found .
on it .
all right , based on what we just got ,
this is the revised best guess
on the victims &apos; routes the days they were abducted .
two intersect here ,
the other two here .
and this is where terry rodgers bought his groceries .
it looks like paul hicks
might have gone there after his doctor &apos;s appointment .
now , what was at the intersection where deaver and ellard crossed ?
that &apos;s a shopping center with a dozen or so businesses .
we &apos;re getting a list right now .
one of our deputies sighted an abandoned car
on the outskirts of town .
there was a second set of tire tracks behind it
that matched those found at terry rodgers &apos; abduction site .
vehicle &apos;s registered to cheryl winslow ,
4801 davenport avenue .
these are all from a baby shower .
we contacted her husband .
she &apos;s due in 3 weeks .
if this is our unsub ,
taking a pregnant woman would be a huge shift in victimology .
we profiled she was abducting the men as breeders .
but why take someone else &apos;s baby
if you &apos;re planning on having your own ?
maybe she can &apos;t have one or she lost one .
ok , so this-- this isn &apos;t about fertility ,
but the experience these men would bring as fathers .
could she be building a family ?
ohh ... oh , please . oh , please .
what are you doing ? !
keep still .
oh , my god !
prep and get her to o.r. 3 .
doctor , is she gonna make it ?
there &apos;s been massive blood loss .
she was given a c @-@ section with a serrated @-@ edge knife ,
then crudely stitched back up .
we found her and the baby in our parking lot .
how &apos;s the baby ?
the child is fine .
it &apos;s her i &apos;m worried about . excuse me .
touch @-@ and @-@ go for a while , but she &apos;s going to make it .
thank god .
it was a crude stitch @-@ up job , but functional .
probably what saved her life .
whoever did this had some practice somewhere .
you think there &apos;d be any way we could talk to her ?
it &apos;s very important .
i &apos;m sorry , but the next 24 hours are critical .
she &apos;s heavily sedated .
i understand .
her husband &apos;s here . excuse me .
our unsub removed the baby ,
then returned mother and child to a hospital .
baby wasn &apos;t due for 3 more weeks .
if the unsub &apos;s trying to put together the perfect family ,
maybe a premature infant isn &apos;t good enough .
let &apos;s hope not .
that means she &apos;ll go out looking for a healthier baby now .
mommy ?
mommy ?
lexy , get down from there !
that was hotch .
the doctor told him the placenta
was scraped completely out of the victim &apos;s uterus .
every bit of it .
you know , the placenta does carry special significance in many cultures .
in ancient egypt , it had its own hieroglyph .
and the ibo tribe in nigeria
considered it to be the child &apos;s dead twin .
well , that would be helpful ,
if our unsub was an ancient egyptian or ibo tribeswoman ,
but ...
i can hear the high @-@ pitched whine
from your i.q. all the way over here .
what is it ?
it could be placentophagy .
what ?
consuming it . in the wild ,
it &apos;s common for animals to eat their own afterbirth .
it &apos;s super rich in nutrients .
whoa , whoa , whoa , wait .
so the unsub might have
harvested this last victim ...
for food ?
here .
no !
no ...
no , please , mommy .
i promise i won &apos;t go to the barn again . i promise .
this is not punishment .
i &apos;m trying to keep you healthy .
no !
no !
what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
do you have any idea what i did to get that for us ?
it &apos;s ruined .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , i &apos;m sorry i yelled at you .
but ...
mommy ?
it &apos;s about food .
herbal sedatives , gruel , and now the placenta .
ugh . and fyi ,
there &apos;s no record of anyone in la grande
buying that weird kind of sawdust the m.e. found .
i &apos;ll widen the search .
we still need to figure out how this unsub
was able to drug all these men .
the southeast intersect doesn &apos;t get us much .
laundromat , video rental store .
the other intersect is the supermarket ,
but none of the employees recognized paul hicks .
he never shopped there .
garcia , what day of the week were each of the victims abducted ?
let me see . gary ellard on a monday ,
barry deaver on a saturday ,
terry rodgers and paul hicks both on a thursday .
is there anything special that happens
in the vicinity of the market on thursdays ?
wow , you &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
yeah . there &apos;s a farmers market across the street
from the supermarket every thursday morning .
and where is it today ?
pendleton , about 40 miles north on interstate 84 .
i &apos;m sending blake and morgan .
enjoying your melatonin bar ?
job &apos;s making you paranoid , blake .
well , apparently a lot of people work this market .
it &apos;s not like everybody else knows everybody else .
i &apos;m gonna get a list of vendors and launch garcia anyway .
you can see how it happened , though .
and terry rodgers got his groceries ,
made his way back to his car .
grabbed a power drink on his way home .
he drank it ...
and then he tossed it .
now the melatonin &apos;s in his system
with no evidence of where it came from .
hey , what do you got ?
full toxicology report .
and ?
unlike any tox panel i &apos;ve ever seen before .
they found gypsum ?
yeah . gypsum &apos;s rich in sulphur ,
a vital plant nutrient .
she &apos;s feeding her captives soil additives ?
seed meals , too . look , cotton , flax .
come on .
it &apos;s animal feed .
why would you treat a human being like livestock ?
people raise cattle to eat .
the unsub might be using the placenta as food ,
but nothing in the profile suggested cannibalism .
i mean ... unless the sawdust they found in terry rodgers &apos; nose ...
what about it ?
when livestock die , animal carcasses
turn into a useful soil amendment
through the aerobic biodegration process .
like compost .
exactly . you need to add a substrate high in carbon
to balance the nitrogen .
and one of the most efficient substrates on earth
is pure sawdust .
she &apos;s using her victims as human fertilizer .
how are you feeling , honey ?
this won &apos;t hurt you .
i made it all from roots and herbs .
all it does is help you take a little nap .
and when you wake up ,
you &apos;ll be the beautiful little girl that you are .
ok , put your arms around me now .
how are we doing with the farmers market background search ?
not good .
turns out that people who grow organic rutabagas
are loosey @-@ goosey about punching in a time clock .
sheriff , if we expand the search of the second intersection
by a few square blocks ,
would we find any markets or restaurants ?
there &apos;s a health food co @-@ op 3 blocks away .
the soil will heal you .
he surgeon who operated on cheryl winslow
said that whoever did the c @-@ section might have done one before .
if she did , we never heard about it .
nothing like this has ever happened in la grande .
well , we can keep looking ,
expand the search radius to nearby towns .
what about farms ?
my grandparents had a farm in pennsylvania .
once my grandmother had to deliver a calf by c @-@ section
to a cow that was in distress .
go ahead , garcia .
i have got something . emma kerrigan .
she runs a small juice and vegetable stand at the farmers market ,
and she works part @-@ time
giving out free samples at the health food co @-@ op .
i &apos;m sending you her picture now .
that sounds like our unsub .
where does she live ?
piping rock farms , west of town ,
with 100 acres ,
belonged to her husband &apos;s family .
wait , she has a husband ?
had . died in a car accident a year and a half ago ,
leaving her and a 10 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve got more info on emma kerrigan .
30 e.r. visits in the past 6 months .
big @-@ time hypochondriac . a co @-@ worker says
she didn &apos;t eat anything unless she grew it herself .
to be fair , she did have an actual skin disease a couple years ago ,
scleroderma .
garcia , did the e.r. visits
coincide with the death of the husband ?
no . she was sick with the scleroderma when he died .
cleared up a few months later .
the e.r. visits didn &apos;t kick in until the following year .
please ...
clear .
clear !
clear .
what &apos;s that ?
garcia ,
what happened to emma kerrigan &apos;s husband &apos;s body after he died ?
uh , cremated .
and what happened to the ashes ?
obit says they were planning on spreading his ashes
in the family garden throughout the 4 seasons .
renewal , cycle of life , rejuvenation , that kind of thing .
garcia , you got a map of the farm ?
place this size , we need to narrow the search .
i got the satellite image .
there &apos;s two groups of buildings .
and then there &apos;s a small square patch next to a barn
that could be a private garden .
all right , let &apos;s go .
hotch . back garden .
emma kerrigan , fbi .
put your hands where i can see them .
emma , put that knife down .
no . my daughter needs this . look at her .
put it down so we can get her the help she needs .
my daughter will be dead by then .
i believe you , emma .
i can see how sick she is .
i talked to your doctor .
dr. gourse ? you talked to dr. gourse ?
yes . he said lexy is too sick for this to work .
this man &apos;s blood won &apos;t do anything .
but it has to . it &apos;s all i have left .
no .
no . what can cure lexy
is what cured you .
funeral homes are required by law
to keep a portion of the remains
of those that they cremate .
these are your husband &apos;s ashes .
only these will make your daughter well .
those are his ?
it &apos;s a miracle .
it &apos;s a miracle .
not bad , blake .
not bad at all .
took a chance .
i mean , i saw her fireplace there ...
alfred austin said ,
&quot; show me your garden
and i shall tell you what you are . &quot;
i assume you &apos;re not trick @-@ or @-@ treating either ?
ah , none of my treats seem to want to call me back , rossi .
then i &apos;ll buy you dinner .
i &apos;m in .
uh , excuse me , everybody . i have an announcement to make .
as i &apos;m sure some of you were aware ,
henry was a little nervous
about going trick @-@ or @-@ treating this year .
but he &apos;s decided to go anyway .
great . what changed his mind ?
the bau did .
i told him that he should go out on halloween
and try to figure out which monsters are real
and which ones are not .
so he wants to be a profiler .
he wants to be his favorite profiler .
oh , wow ! you look great , henry .
put this on here .
oh , he &apos;s official .
yeah .
tell him .
e equals mc squared !
oh , there it is !
the monsters don &apos;t stand a chance .
oh , i know . shall we go get you some candy ?
come on .
