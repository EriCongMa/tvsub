let &apos;s see what else is out there together .
i suppose there &apos;s no one
i &apos;d rather this dreadful world with .
bag &apos; em up and let &apos;s go home .
i have a way to take down rayna
at the pile of bricks called the armory .
the armory is a black hole of lies .
as long as i have this scar , rayna will hunt me .
but if she dies for good ,
everyone with that scar on your chest does as well .
i sacrificed everyone and everything for you .
if there &apos;s even a fraction of you that cares about me ,
then you will not walk out that door .
all right , i did it . he &apos;s out .
now i never see you again , right ?
have a nice life .
what if i were to tell you there &apos;s a way
for me to transfer that mark
to somebody a little bit more deserving ?
it should have been damon all along .
you want to pit us against each other .
except it wasn &apos;t her idea .
it was mine .
sun &apos;s coming up , stefan .
make your choice .
it &apos;s a pretty big deal , you know ?
me offering to take this scar from you .
but , hey , i &apos;ve been on the bench for quite a while ,
and you look pretty tired .
so let me tap in and give you a breather .
hashtag you &apos;re welcome .
are hashtags still a thing ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s been three years .
say yes , stefan .
you can stop running .
you &apos;ll get your life back .
all it &apos;s gonna take is one itty @-@ bitty transfer spell .
any more suspense , i might pass out , little brother .
of course , i might pass out anyway .
come on .
phone &apos;s in my pocket .
valerie can do the spell .
hallelujah , he &apos;s seen the light .
now , i &apos;m just gonna loosen these lug nuts up a little bit .
just to get his phone .
okay ?
make sure he behaves .
you okay ?
brother , i &apos;m so full of werewolf toxin i can &apos;t even feel my face .
little vervain &apos;s not gonna hurt me now .
thank you .
if you kill me , you kill anyone i &apos;ve marked with my sword .
that includes your brother .
don &apos;t worry about stefan .
i &apos;m just giving him a head start .
see ? now i &apos;m in st. petersburg .
red pin , i &apos;m in malaysia .
red pin ...
oh , dear , i &apos;ve landed in the ocean .
they do sell liquor elsewhere , you know ?
it &apos;s best to travel light .
yeah , but ... it &apos;s my favorite kind .
i &apos;m wondering how many more of these i can have ...
now that i &apos;m on a time limit .
no time limits here .
the night is young , my friend .
i &apos;m not talking about tonight .
i did the math .
rayna cruz won &apos;t live forever , therefore neither will i.
so ... tick @-@ tock .
and you found mortality doesn &apos;t trouble you .
no , actually , funny thing is it makes me feel human again ,
like every minute counts .
then ... let &apos;s think of it as an adventure .
right now ?
damon &apos;s gone .
you have no one waiting at home anymore .
i have no one either .
why not just follow where the red pins lead ?
so you want to go , uh , pin @-@ hopping all over the world ?
while we search for a way to get rid of your scar .
we could trace rayna &apos;s bloodline
back to wherever her ancestors come from .
start searching for answers there .
but best @-@ case scenario , we save your life .
worst @-@ case , we have a long vacation .
everyone you know has made the choice that serves them best .
why not make a choice that serves you ?
well , i guess there &apos;s nothing left to hold me back here .
sure .
three years with us ,
and you still haven &apos;t learned to sit quietly .
do you like the change in scenery ?
where is she ?
what did you people do to her ?
where is mary lou ?
we need your help .
the only help i &apos;d ever give you is off a cliff .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
because we have something you want .
answers about the research we &apos;ve been doing with your girlfriend .
i &apos;ll do anything , just ...
name your price .
the price is a name , actually .
lorenzo st. john .
enzo .
why do you want him ?
so i can kill him myself .
not that i &apos;m not grateful for the chance to get some air ,
but what exactly am i doing ?
i believe enzo released rayna cruz .
why ? i have no idea .
why does enzo do anything lately ?
but i have learned over time that if i can &apos;t trust my family ,
i certainly can &apos;t trust my usual team .
and that &apos;s where you come in .
you can be the one to hunt him down .
you trust the girl you &apos;ve held captive for three blood years ?
&quot; trust &quot; may be too strong a word .
but after you see the results of our experiments ,
you &apos;ll be highly incentivized to do what i want .
are you all right ?
just ... just feeling cold .
who could blame you in this horrid , damp basement ?
every day , i dream i &apos;ll carry you away from this place .
leaving a trail of gutted corpses in our wake .
you seem quite yourself .
what happened ?
they gave me pills .
made from rayna &apos;s blood .
it &apos;s poisonous to witches .
bring enzo back to me alive ,
and i &apos;ll give you everything i have to heal her .
no , please don &apos;t go .
i have to .
i &apos;m going to save you .
hey , martel , what &apos;s up ? i got your text .
i owe you for calling off the alert on the whole hostage hoax ,
so whatever you want , man .
all he wants is to cooperate with me .
i compelled him to summon you here
while remaining silent and calm .
detective , cuff yourself to the car .
so by now i &apos;m sure alex has decided
that i &apos;m the one who let rayna escape ,
which of course is untrue .
but what i &apos;ve yet to understand is ...
why did you release rayna cruz ?
so damon said he could take my scar through a transfer spell .
does that make any sense to you ?
he must have been desperate to come up with that idea .
ironic that he &apos;s the one that finally figured it out ,
considering how far you and i went looking for a solution .
i suppose fate has a sense of humor .
taxi &apos;s here . i better go .
hey , be careful , okay ?
always , love .
i &apos;ll get to dallas as quickly as i can .
oh , you stayed to keep me company .
how sweet .
nice try .
once i &apos;m done patching myself up , i &apos;m out of here .
because as much as i &apos;d like to kill you first ,
my sword is on the move and so is my target .
i have to chase them both .
when mystical nature calls .
so weird .
how stefan ran away from your offer .
he &apos;s just being a martyr .
he probably thinks i can &apos;t handle the scar .
as soon as i charge this , i &apos;ll call him ,
tell him to get his ass back here .
we &apos;ll do the transfer spell .
that is downright noble .
more than i expected from you .
especially considering
everything you have to give up .
what am i gonna give up ?
i &apos;ve been in a coffin for the last three years .
it &apos;s not like i was keeping up with my hobbies .
look at my arm , what do you see ?
someone who should have brought band @-@ aids .
i &apos;m made up of regular flesh and bone .
my body &apos;s 100 % human .
even if i stay in good health , in 60 to 70 years ,
i &apos;ll toddle off to the big news station in the sky ,
which means right around the time elena wakes up ,
i &apos;ll be dead . so will you .
because if i die , you &apos;ll die ,
but i &apos;m sure you already figured out
that when you take stefan &apos;s scar ,
you &apos;ll be giving up your future with elena .
you &apos;ll never see her again .
the hero move .
nice .
okay .
got to go .
we are looking for ways to get rid of a mystical scar .
that &apos;s right .
it links me to a crazy woman .
not me .
no , we &apos;re not linked .
oh , no , no , no .
we &apos;re just friends . and she &apos;s not crazy .
well ... not in a bad way .
yeah , you &apos;ve gone off topic .
now you &apos;ve made her uncomfortable .
i haven &apos;t made her uncomfortable .
she doesn &apos;t understand what we &apos;re saying .
nobody here has any idea what we &apos;re saying .
well , here &apos;s to our one @-@ year anniversary
of chasing red pins around the world .
yeah . one year of complete and total ... failure .
hey , it &apos;s not complete failure .
while we have not solved your scar situation yet ,
we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols .
i &apos;m afraid he can &apos;t come to the phone right now .
nope .
nope , he never will .
i brought up how long it &apos;s been .
sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i know what day it is .
i &apos;ve actually been thinking about it quite a bit .
and ... ?
and i realized that by the time he wakes up ,
i will probably be dead .
so , uh , no .
never gonna call him again .
and , likewise , he will never call you .
so , guess that makes this ...
obsolete .
well ...
cheers , then ?
cheers .
my turn to order .
uh , one more ?
i understand .
i also understood what you were saying over there .
i think i know how to help .
caroline ?
no such luck .
just me .
i took caroline &apos;s work cell ,
which you kept calling the other day .
wanted to check in on you .
did you really call me just to chat ?
don &apos;t hang up .
there &apos;s still time for me to help you .
well , here &apos;s an idea .
why don &apos;t you stop chasing me ?
you took my sword , genius .
i need to get it back .
if you didn &apos;t want to get chased ,
you should &apos;ve stayed put at the news station .
and let you kill my brother ?
not likely .
so you &apos;d rather be first in line to go ?
see , now i &apos;m confused .
i thought you were trying to give me a pass .
i was ,
in my own way .
this is going to sound strange , but ...
you grew on me while i was trapped in the armory .
you were the only distraction from my routine .
every day , while they were taking my blood
and using it for their &quot; research , &quot;
i &apos;d close my eyes
and watch you .
i could see where you were ,
what you were doing .
i saw you travel the world with valerie .
how would you know that ?
i always know what my targets are up to .
that mark on your chest--
it &apos;s not just a scar , it &apos;s a ...
mystical connection .
to me .
that &apos;s gotta be the worst pickup line i &apos;ve ever heard in my life .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
you did just say you spent the last three years spying on me .
the armory doesn &apos;t have tv .
what else was i gonna do ?
well , this isn &apos;t creepy at all .
the point is , i know exactly where you are
and what you &apos;re doing now .
you &apos;re leading me towards the armory .
you &apos;re hoping they &apos;ll provide an assist .
but virginia &apos;s a long drive from here .
unless your car runs on something other than gas ,
you &apos;re not gonna make it there before i catch you .
i &apos;m gaining on you .
i can tell .
really ?
i &apos;m coming ...
hello , kq ...
something , something .
my vision &apos;s gone blurry .
how goes it , mad max ?
had to stop for gas .
i was expecting a much cooler answer , but ...
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t really have much of a choice .
ditched the sword to buy myself a little bit of time .
i could really use a great idea for what to do next .
sorry , little fuzzy , you know .
toxin fever and all .
valerie &apos;s coming to fix that .
so you guys are hanging , now , huh ?
our friendship evolved .
i bet it did .
listen , as much as i love catching up with you ,
i do have to resume escaping from a serial killer ,
so if you could ...
h @-@ head back toward the news station .
i &apos;ll find you a place to lead rayna .
that &apos;s your great idea ?
i &apos;ll have the armory come out and meet you .
they still want rayna .
just keep driving , stefan .
i &apos;ll be in touch , okay ?
why are you even in dallas ?
i &apos;m here for work .
everyone &apos;s looking for rayna ,
the armory sent an alert when she escaped .
i knew she &apos;d use caroline to set a trap for stefan ,
so i wasn &apos;t surprised by the hostage broadcast .
but i did grow curious when the police failed to respond .
i discovered that
you convinced them the whole thing was a @-@ a hoax .
now , why would you do that ?
i reckoned you wouldn &apos;t talk .
even if i tortured you .
so i &apos;m going to torture him , instead .
you wonder why i released rayna ?
look at what you &apos;re doing right now .
i know you have a strong dislike for my ilk ,
but if you wanted to unleash rayna on us ,
why wait until now to free her ?
ask stefan salvatore .
curiouser and curiouser .
motem !
get off me !
alsakes ...
fascinating stuff , isn &apos;t it ?
that dose will keep you quiet for an hour or so .
your toy got away .
that &apos;s all right . i &apos;m trading up .
i like you better without your magic .
well , lucky for you i &apos;m weak with hunger .
haven &apos;t had a proper meal in three bloody years .
no !
no !
are you that attached to witchy powers ?
i &apos;m attached to being alive .
those pills are what poisoned mary lou !
what do you mean , poisoned ?
i was promised an antidote in return for your capture .
who promised you ?
alex . she said you released rayna .
incorrect .
i &apos;m guessing she only told you that to motivate you .
my only motivation is mary louise .
she &apos;s all i have in this world , and i will not let her die !
what &apos;s the matter ?
afraid to hit me back ?
i &apos;m calling a truce .
i don &apos;t want one !
listen to me ! if those pills are fatal to witches ,
then you and i need to work together .
why should i trust you ?
because i care about this as much as you do .
i swear it on my life .
you owe some guy a cube truck .
do you talk this much to all your targets ?
just the ones i &apos;m trying to help .
you need all the help you can get ,
since your brother &apos;s not exactly reliable .
i know that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been thinking .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
mystical connection . remember ?
anyway , i don &apos;t blame you for doubting damon .
you always knew
having him in your orbit might get you killed someday .
i thought getting me killed was your department .
i &apos;m plagued with a responsibility .
that doesn &apos;t mean i like it .
i actually think you &apos;re an okay person .
despite what matt thinks .
that guy really hates you .
yeah .
i &apos;m starting to figure that out .
he wouldn &apos;t let me out of my cell
until i promised to put you back in the hell stone .
want to talk about it ?
nope . gotta save my battery .
damon salvatore .
a voice from the great beyond .
well , if the great beyond is in dallas ,
then yep .
you sound a bit worse for wear , mate .
me ? never better .
listen ,
are you still friends with those nut jobs at the armory ?
ever to the point .
why ? what do you need ?
i need to set up a meet .
stefan &apos;s got rayna cruz on his tail .
and he needs to come in for a landing .
oh , i know just the spot .
literally .
the armory uses an air field near dallas .
i &apos;ll text you and stefan the coordinates
for the hostage exchange .
i &apos;m loving your james bond vibe .
somehow i didn &apos;t miss you at all .
there you are .
&quot; hostage exchange &quot; ?
you want mary louise .
alex wants me .
i dare say she &apos;ll get more than she gives .
don &apos;t be absurd .
she wants me to bring you back to the armory .
and you trust her ?
unless you &apos;re eager for captivity or death ,
i advise you to do this my way .
so , if the goal is to stay alive ,
then why draw the huntress to our meeting place ?
luring rayna to the air strip makes it worth alex &apos;s while
to come out into the open .
i &apos;ll tell her to bring mary louise ,
but leave her lackeys behind .
did alex give you a phone to use ?
cheers .
why are you helping me ?
let &apos;s just say i prefer the direct approach .
&quot; come live with me and be my love ,
&quot; and we will all the pleasures prove ,
&quot; no valleys , groves ,
&quot; hills and fields ,
woods or steepy mountain yields ... &quot;
don &apos;t let me stop the poetry .
it wasn &apos;t for your entertainment .
free @-@ styling ?
it &apos;s one of nora &apos;s favorite poems .
she used to read it to me daily .
she does care about you .
as evinced by the fact that she demanded you come with me .
nora found enzo in dallas .
all this trouble for him ?
partly for enzo .
partly for your friend , rayna cruz .
rayna .
you gonna kick me in the face again ?
frankly , i &apos;d rather do that .
but stefan asked me to heal you .
now i know why stefan digs you .
you &apos;re a take @-@ charge kind of gal .
and you &apos;re a self @-@ serving narcissist .
oh , slightly domineering .
also stefan &apos;s type .
much better .
i had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell .
yeah , about that .
there you are .
check out the sky .
the bartender has a theory .
of course he does .
if there &apos;s one thing we &apos;ve learned
from our travels all over the world ,
it &apos;s that every bartender has a theory ,
and every one of them is wrong .
now ...
look up .
at what ?
at the sky .
come on , just humor me .
live in the moment .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here for , right ?
right .
yeah . lovely stars .
they &apos;re bigger this close to the equator .
they &apos;re the same as i &apos;ve seen from every place else .
there &apos;s orion , cassiopeia--
cassiopeia is my favorite .
voice of doom .
saw the truth when no one else did .
you &apos;re thinking of cassandra .
she doesn &apos;t have a constellation .
no , no , no , no .
constellation &apos;s cassiopeia , that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
no , it &apos;s not .
yeah , it is .
you know why ? because i said so .
you &apos;re an idiot .
you &apos;re right . i am .
who are you ?
who are you ?
nobody important .
invisiway .
as requested .
and as promised , here i am .
where &apos;s mary louise ?
resting in the office .
i hope you remember how to drive .
what about the antidote ?
who said i had an antidote ?
you said you &apos;d help mary louise .
i said i &apos;d give you everything i know about the pills .
here &apos;s what i know .
we tried to create the antidote , and we failed .
what ?
meanwhile , mary louise will be dead within the week .
i &apos;ll tear your throat out !
no !
i need her first .
you can stay here and yell at me if you want ,
but then i might not give you a car .
i suggest you go make the most of the time
your girlfriend has left .
for your sake , i hope you &apos;re lying .
why so interested in the pills ?
they &apos;re really only useful if you want to fight a witch .
or hide from a locator spell .
speak plainly , alexandria .
i &apos;m not in the mood for delay .
i know you &apos;ve been raiding the armory &apos;s supplies .
figured it out after rayna escaped .
but why did you steal so many pills ?
who could you have been giving them to ?
i haven &apos;t stolen anything , all right ?
seems to me , you &apos;ve just lost track of your possessions .
or perhaps you &apos;re lying to me ?
we &apos;re family , so you know i &apos;m not an idiot .
give bonnie bennett my regards .
good afternoon . this is your captain speaking .
we have leveled off at our cruising altitude .
please feel free to move about the cabin ,
unless you are tied up with vervain rope .
why did you stop me from doing the spell ?
i put a little spin on your plan .
god , you &apos;re an ass .
you &apos;re one to talk .
how long did you know you could fix stefan &apos;s problem ?
your suggestion was news to me .
not what i asked !
how long have you known the answer ?
for example , my thinking was ,
the transfer spell worked on ric &apos;s babies .
maybe it &apos;ll work on the scar .
three whole years go by ,
and that little concept never crossed your mind ?
if i was a betting man , which i am ,
i would bet that you knew about the spell all along .
and rather than sharing it with my brother ,
you lied to him .
i never lied to him .
but you didn &apos;t tell him the truth , either , did you ?
because you didn &apos;t want to get rid of that scar .
because without his scar to keep him running ,
he could &apos;ve gone back to caroline .
how insecure could you possibly be ?
all right , i lied .
but i wasn &apos;t protecting myself .
i was protecting him .
by risking his life ?
by keeping you out of it !
the phoenix scar requires a special kind of transfer .
it can only go to a blood relative ,
and that would &apos;ve meant waking you
and bringing you and all the drama
that you come with back into his life--
a life which he was finally thriving in without you .
i get it-- you think i &apos;m a piece of crap .
and by the way , i was .
before .
and then i met a girl , and she made me good .
and that &apos;s why i need elena in my life .
and when i get her back in my life ,
i will be there for stefan .
the only person you ever needed
was by your side all along , and you abandoned him .
so i took your place .
i took caroline &apos;s place . i &apos;ve been everything to him .
sounds more like he was everything to you .
i &apos;ll take that .
hold tight , brother .
this vintage beast only goes so fast .
he &apos;s refusing to participate !
val , you okay ?
she &apos;s wonderful . she &apos;s great .
she &apos;s a rock , and yes ,
i am fully participating .
yeah , by kidnapping me instead of doing the spell .
i needed you for backup . i didn &apos;t have time to argue .
shut up .
you &apos;re not doing the spell ?
stefan ?
we are still gonna save you .
the cavalry &apos;s coming to you , brother .
we &apos;re gonna take down rayna .
you &apos;re gonna get your freedom .
and i &apos;m still gonna get my future .
so you &apos;re not taking the scar ?
relax , i have a good plan .
answer the question , damon .
stefan , listen--
say it !
i want to hear you say it .
you &apos;re not taking the scar .
i have a plan !
you always do .
he never should &apos;ve trusted you .
don &apos;t get me started on trust .
all right , can we just stay focused here ?
how far-- ?
stefan ? stef ?
i &apos;ll catch you later .
we &apos;re too late !
we &apos;re too late because of you .
no .
no , we &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
you &apos;re clinging to the coward &apos;s way out .
this is exactly why stefan ran .
i thought stefan ran to save me from rayna .
he ran , because he knew that when the moment came ,
you &apos;d let him down and choose yourself .
in his heart of hearts , that &apos;s what he thinks of you ,
and he &apos;s right .
now is when you prove who you really are .
okay .
screw it , i &apos;m in .
i am damon salvatore .
i &apos;ll figure this out .
we need to draw rayna away from stefan . do the spell now .
we have to pull over .
we don &apos;t have time to pull over !
just give me the scar now !
mary lou ?
mary lou , it &apos;s me .
just having a little nap .
how are you feeling ?
awful .
i &apos;ve been poisoned .
alex said you &apos;re going to be just fine .
you are ...
a terrible liar .
nora , i &apos;m dying .
there is no antidote , alex told me .
well , i don &apos;t care what she says .
we &apos;ll find a way , together .
you &apos;re driving .
i &apos;ve got even less time left on earth than i thought .
oh , shut up .
come on .
you never should have sent him there to meet her .
less blame , more magic . go .
i want to finish our conversation .
i prefer our phone calls .
it hurts me to see you like this , stefan .
i mean , it really hurts me .
because of our connection , i can feel what my targets feel .
like when matt set me free at the armory .
as soon as i touched my sword , i felt what it did to you .
i felt your scar reopen .
right then .
the smart play would have been valerie .
get your backup girl and go on the run with her again .
but that &apos;s not who you wanted .
not valerie ,
not even caroline .
you wanted damon .
there was only one way you could talk to him .
damon ,
wake the hell up !
you slowed yourself down ,
getting your albatross out of storage .
my scar ... opened up this morning .
i figured she was back .
i didn &apos;t realize she was this close .
you almost gave me time to catch you .
you just had to have damon along for the ride again .
those three years he was in the coffin ,
guess that was all the enjoyment you could take .
i didn &apos;t enjoy being a fugitive .
yes , you did .
you were happy while your brother was gone .
you were happy because he was gone .
and now here we are , thanks to him .
you can see the cause and effect , right ?
you can see that you &apos;re in this bind
because of the dumb @-@ ass mistake you made
by waking damon up ?
why do you care about my mistakes ?
it &apos;s not me who cares .
it &apos;s the phoenix stone .
its voice is in my head all the time .
you have no idea how loud it is .
it wants to liberate you , stefan .
it is still trying to show you
the only way for you to be free is to let damon go .
you &apos;ve ignored its wisdom before .
are you finally ready to leave damon behind ?
did today convince you ?
yes .
now remember that ...
and use it to survive in the hell stone this time .
uh , something &apos;s wrong .
wait , why &apos;s it going away ?
the spell &apos;s unraveling .
there &apos;s no scar to transfer .
what do you mean there &apos;s no scar ?
matt , it &apos;s caroline .
i know there has to be a reason why you helped rayna ,
but i need to hear it from you .
i did it .
i made stefan pay for what he did .
just like i promised you .
right , no more gloomy talk now .
first thing we &apos;ll do is get you a decent meal ,
something plump and juicy from the suburbs .
nothing too decadent .
i &apos;m trying to maintain my charms .
to my eyes , you are perfect .
no .
stefan .
stefan , no .
stefan .
we can bring him back .
we &apos;ve done it before .
where &apos;s the damn sword ?
where &apos;s the sword ? !
that was an amazing escape .
i take back all my insults about your driving .
she &apos;ll follow us .
of course she will . we have her sword .
no .
no time for gloomy talk .
i &apos;ve been marked by rayna cruz ,
and i &apos;ll be running from her for as long as i live .
no . no , that bitch has taken enough from us .
no , what are you doing ?
one good thing with the strength that i have left .
no . you can &apos;t . stop it .
it &apos;s too strong , you won &apos;t be able ...
i will not let her put you in this hell stone !
if you don &apos;t stop , you will die .
i &apos;m already dead , my love .
it &apos;s my fault .
no , this is all on me .
i tried to have it all .
next time , it &apos;ll be different .
nora , don &apos;t !
you must live .
there is no life without you .
&quot; come live with me and be my love ,
&quot; and we will all the pleasures prove ,
&quot; no valleys ,
groves , hills and fields ... &quot;
everything will be okay , stefan .
i &apos;ll get that stone , and we &apos;ll make this right .
woods or steepy mountains yield ...
and we will sit upon the rocks ,
seeing the shepherds feed their flocks ,
&quot; and i will make thee beds of roses ... &quot;
i love you .
i love you .
no !
no !
i &apos;m gonna save you , little brother .
i promise .
i promise you .
