we need more water !
hill , flynn , grant !
yes , sir ?
we got to get this under control .
we got old , combustible buildings in a tight space .
grant , you &apos;re with hill .
where do you want us , chief ?
i need you guys to spread out inside .
knock it down as much as you can , okay ? now , go !
all right , listen , i &apos;ll take the rear .
i got the roof . i &apos;ll take the front .
let &apos;s all go home .
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
come on , jo . pee .
hey , potty .
you know what ? fine .
stay out here by yourself . fine .
oh , i &apos;d hate to report you for doggie abandonment .
what are you doing here ?
i was , um ... in the neighborhood ?
thank you .
it &apos;s good to see you .
more than good to see you .
no , don &apos;t be nice to her . don &apos;t --
jo , you &apos;re not getting out of this .
what are you doing here ? you on leave ?
no .
i , uh ... i asked to be reassigned -- d.c.
ah , so no more foreign wars .
for now .
is that ... bad ?
no . it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just unexpected .
well , you probably have to get to work .
so ... what , you &apos;re going ?
yeah . but i &apos;m hoping to see you soon .
what &apos;s the card say ?
read it .
call me .
hello .
uh , rizzoli .
good morning .
damn it .
that &apos;s an awful lot of trouble for a cup of coffee .
well , my mother is an espresso enthusiast .
yeah , it &apos;s the burden of being a super taster .
my mother is also a super smeller .
i used patchouli oil once in college ,
and you said you could smell it on me
when i came home for christmas .
oh , dreadful stuff .
how did you sleep ?
surprisingly well .
her father snores .
ohh . i don &apos;t miss that part of marriage .
excuse me . thank you .
dr. isles .
all right . okay .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go to work .
a factory caught on fire early this morning .
we &apos;ll be fine .
i make a mean eggs benedict .
dean asked me to dinner .
so go !
what about casey ?
i wonder if they know each other .
well , they were both in afghanistan .
yeah , maura ,
all 30,000 of them know each other .
well , dean only went to afghanistan
because you said you wouldn &apos;t read the sunday paper
in bed with him .
i was not ready for that big of a commitment .
you &apos;re not even ready for the commitment
of calling him by his first name .
it &apos;s gabriel .
&quot; gabriel . &quot; it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s so weird .
it &apos;s so ... biblical .
firemen &apos;s formation .
i hate it when they lose one of their own .
sad .
order ! arms !
i &apos;ll check out the body . okay .
arson squad &apos;s working it ,
but they &apos;re saying it looked accidental .
faulty space heater started a fire .
hmm . what do they make in here ?
denim jeans .
&quot; denim &quot; jeans ?
as opposed to ... green polyester jeans ?
see that guy ?
old guy in the skinny jeans and the shades ?
he &apos;s not that old .
i busted him at least three times in the &apos; 80s .
hmm . felony fashion crime ?
would you two like a moment alone
so you can fight ?
he borrows my unmarked , and he brings it back empty !
hey , it had gas !
busted whistler for cocaine .
now he owns a jeans factory .
does he have any reason to burn it down ?
maybe . check it out , frost .
sure . when you fill my tank back up .
wisuper .
his face shield is pitted .
he wouldn &apos;t have needed to take more than a few breaths
before the smoke inhalation killed him .
it &apos;s a damn shame .
i &apos;m so sorry , chief .
i sent him in there without any backup .
it &apos;s not your fault , joe .
we &apos;ve been fighting these blazes without enough people .
that &apos;s what budget cuts will get you .
this city &apos;s killing good men .
forced layoffs , station closing .
well , we can &apos;t do anything about budget cuts ,
but let &apos;s make sure there was nothing else at work here .
i never understood guys who wanted to run
into burning buildings .
you chase murderers .
not if they &apos;re on fire .
do you know why firefighters
call their outfits &quot; bunker gear &quot; ?
their &quot; outfits &quot; ?
yes , because they keep their outfit next to their bunks .
darn !
hey , did you know the first helmet
was developed by luggage maker henry gratacap ?
does your brain ever get tired ?
no . why ?
well , just with all the useless information --
no ?
god , how hot does a fire have to be
to melt the face shield ?
this can withstand heat up to 500 degrees fahrenheit .
and he &apos;s got scorched gloves .
if his gloves are scorched
and his face shield is melted ,
shouldn &apos;t the rest of his body be badly burned , as well ?
not necessarily .
the fire suit can withstand heat up to 1,300 degrees .
pulmonary parenchymal damage
consistent with inhaling air above 265 degrees .
odd .
what ... odd ?
he takes a breath or two , and boom --
he &apos;s dead by smoke inhalation .
the soot build @-@ up on the walls and windows --
that &apos;s evidence of a low @-@ oxygen fire .
but his face shield and lungs say it &apos;s a high @-@ oxygen fire .
i wrote about this once
in the journal of combustible science .
yes . it was a fabulous article .
i loved the photos .
i &apos;ll print it up for you .
maura ... why waste paper ?
i &apos;ll --i &apos;ll read it online .
you &apos;re not gonna read it .
no , probably not .
but you are going to dinner with gabriel .
how &apos;d you know i was going to dinner ?
you brushed your teeth .
i @-@ i always ...
brush my teeth ...
at work ... sometimes .
i have a reservation at the ivory table .
i could call and make it for four .
we could double @-@ date .
really ? why ? who &apos;s your date ?
my mother .
oh , so , you , me , gabriel , and your mother .
mm @-@ hmm . how can i say &quot; no &quot; ?
you &apos;re being sarcastic , aren &apos;t you ?
very .
if it was anyone but you ,
i &apos;d say that &apos;s the creepiest idea ever .
the arson squad released the space heater to my team .
hmm , did you just say the &quot; a &quot; word ?
no . yes .
so you think it was arson ?
no . yes .
no . anything ?
i think it &apos;s this heater that was recalled in 1997,
but it &apos;s covered in debris , so i &apos;m not sure .
fire can be a very clever opponent .
yeah .
take it apart . look for any anomalies .
i &apos;ve requested all boston fire department records
for the last year .
that &apos;s like 4,000 fires .
4,082 building and structural fires .
well , if you &apos;re looking at the incident reports
for a possible pattern ,
then you are thinking the &quot; a &quot; word
and i need to let the arson squad know .
i think gabriel is a really good match for you .
nobody ask you , yenta .
whistler ,
our old guy in the skinny jeans , is a pervert .
okay , what would you like me to do with this information ?
check this out -- five different lawsuits .
women suing him right and left for sexual harassment .
two seamstresses , an accountant , a model , and ...
really ? a cleaning woman .
strong libido .
apparently it doesn &apos;t take him much to get interested .
apparently .
pretty expensive to fend off five lawsuits .
yes , it is .
maybe arnold burnt down his only asset
to collect the insurance money .
let &apos;s go talk to him .
do you have an eye condition ?
excuse me ?
the sunglasses .
it &apos;s safe to remove them .
our lights are harmless .
i &apos;ve advised mr . whistler
that this interview is 100 % voluntary .
he &apos;s not required -- - it &apos;s all right , hon .
i &apos;ve got nothing to hide from these people .
did you just call your lawyer &quot; hon &quot; ?
christie is my daughter .
she &apos;s harvard law , right , hon ?
i handle all matters pertaining to arnold whistler denim .
then you &apos;re handling all the
sexual harassment claims against your father ?
nuisance lawsuits .
it &apos;s a bunch of angry single women .
those are a lot of angry &quot; hons , &quot; mr. whistler .
those fat bitches are suing me for being nice ?
tell them i &apos;m gonna sue them
for leaving their space heaters on .
i &apos;m the victim .
my business is destroyed . what about me ?
what about the firefighter who died
trying to save your factory ?
well , those are the breaks . it &apos;s his job --
hey , dad -- - hon , don &apos;t interrupt me .
listen to me , mr . whistler .
we &apos;re going to dig into your life ,
and if we find out
that you had anything to do with setting that fire ,
you &apos;re gonna wish you were on the inside sewing jeans
when it went up .
i don &apos;t appreciate your tone , detective .
me , neither .
come on , hon .
your father never lets me eat garlic -- never !
i &apos;m so glad you liked it .
it &apos;s delightful just being able to see you .
i wish we &apos;d done this more .
come to see me ? me too .
no . it &apos;s ... i @-@ i wish ...
you wish what ?
i wish that i had stopped being busy
and ... just enjoyed you .
stop , mom , it &apos;s okay .
no . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s really true that your life gets lived
while you are doing other things .
come on . come on , let &apos;s go home .
let &apos;s have some tea .
you know me . tea &apos;s not gonna do it .
mom !
somebody , call an ambulance !
do something !
call 911 !
you look amazing .
you look like you &apos;re about to eat here .
hope that &apos;s okay . no ?
no , it &apos;s okay . i just ...
i feel silly .
i &apos;m a little overdressed for take @-@ out .
don &apos;t . i want to look at you .
and i want you all to myself .
you know what ? you can take me out .
i &apos;m not gonna run away with the busboy .
what smells good ? what &apos;d you bring ?
let &apos;s do this right .
do you have some plates ?
gosh , i usually just throw the food on the counter .
okay , just ... one sec .
hey , maura . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
are you okay ?
contusions and scrapes . i &apos;m fine .
where &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s still in surgery .
it &apos;s bad , jane .
they wouldn &apos;t let me in the ambulance with her .
he just drove into her ,
and then he left her .
oh , god .
um , uh , what can i do ?
turn the clock back .
did you see the car ?
no . it all happened so fast .
i sound like all those people that we see every day , don &apos;t i ?
it &apos;s okay .
she pushed me out of the way , jane .
my mother saved my life .
oh . how is she ?
it was a severe open book pelvic fracture ,
just like you thought .
okay . uh , and how &apos;s the bleeding ?
we performed an anterior pelvic open reduction
and internal fixation .
and the head and the cervical cts ?
there &apos;s some cranial bleeding ,
but we &apos;re doing all that we can , dr . isles .
i know you are . thank you , doctor .
you &apos;re welcome . just hold on .
oh , my god . what if she dies ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , god .
my father &apos;s in tanzania .
even if i could reach him ,
it would take him two days to get here .
maura , she &apos;s not gonna die .
she &apos;s not .
this is frost .
he &apos;s already working on the hit @-@ and @-@ run re @-@ enactment .
go .
no , no , no .
yes . yes . please .
go and do what you do better than anyone i know .
find the bastard who did this .
please .
go .
who are you dressed as ?
a person . shut up .
well , nice to see you , too .
i think you look great .
thank you .
now , show me what you &apos;re gonna show me ,
or i &apos;m getting out .
the hit @-@ and @-@ run driver came from that direction .
minimum speed the vehicle was traveling at the time of impact ,
40 miles per hour .
okay , you &apos;re just doing this to show off your car .
i could have read that in the report .
can you talk to detective rizzoli ?
because i can &apos;t .
i asked frankie to do a hit @-@ and @-@ run work @-@ up
for the fatal @-@ accident team
to help him get into homicide faster .
so you want to see what i found out ,
or you want to pick your toes ?
i &apos;m not picking my toes . my feet hurt .
so don &apos;t wear dumb shoes .
show me !
all right , yeah ,
so , there are no skid marks
prior to point of impact .
so that means the driver never applied the brakes .
well , maybe he didn &apos;t see them .
frankie &apos;s got a different theory .
see those ?
locked wheel skid marks .
those say that the driver stopped
after he hit constance .
so he didn &apos;t just take off .
but not because he had a conscience .
take a look at the back @-@ up cam .
he hit reverse .
that &apos;s where maura fell .
right between those parked cars .
spin burn marks .
this wasn &apos;t an accident .
he was trying to hit her .
don &apos;t scream , maura . okay ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
i came as soon as i heard .
you came for what ?
for her .
she &apos;s a good woman .
what do you know about my mother ?
i &apos;d like you to leave .
not until i know she &apos;s okay --
and you &apos;re okay .
you &apos;re here to knock heads ?
you think that &apos;s gonna help ?
you &apos;ll see one day when you have a child --
give it up . you &apos;re a murderer .
i &apos;d rather not be reminded that you fathered me . go !
maura --
i &apos;m gonna scream on the count of three .
one -- - look --
i &apos;ll tell you who your mother is .
that &apos;s my mother .
you once asked me ...
don &apos;t like to be toyed with . two .
i will tell you one day .
when you &apos;re calm .
get out .
did he say why he came ?
not really .
but he seemed like he knew her .
he knew constance ?
he said he &apos;d tell me who my biological mother is .
do you want to know that ?
well , he can &apos;t just keep
popping in and out of your life like this , okay , maura ?
we &apos;ll get him .
i don &apos;t know if i want you to .
well , it &apos;s not up to me .
but you &apos;ve got a more serious problem right now , okay ?
somebody tried to kill you .
skid marks can mean a lot of things .
someone tried to run you over . all right ?
we &apos;ve got to figure out who that is
before they try it again .
jane , i have testified in hundreds of murder trials .
any one of those men and women convicted
could want me dead .
i put a uniform outside .
do you want me to stay ?
no . no , just keep digging .
i &apos;ll be okay .
you know , i &apos;ll never tell you that it &apos;ll be okay
when i don &apos;t know that it will .
but i am here for you . okay ?
so nice of you to bring these for jane .
and i always wanted to try these .
you &apos;d look great in those -- dark @-@ wash skinnies ,
our top seller .
what size are you ? a four ?
i haven &apos;t been a size four since --
since never . step away from the jeans , ma .
i was too a size four .
how would you know ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
the person that you &apos;re flirting with happens to be
a suspect in a possible arson murder .
what do you think -- that
bribing my mother is gonna clear your name ?
listen , hon , you &apos;re tying up my money
with that insurance company .
you bet i am . take your jeans and go .
really ?
crime lab found microscopic traces
of black isocyanate paint
embedded in the broken watch crystal .
it &apos;s automotive paint , jane .
oh , really ? what makes you think that ?
because she was hit by a car ?
okay , how do i get you to talk to me
like you talk to frost ?
well , don &apos;t state the obvious ,
first of all , all right ?
did you run it through the automotive paint database ?
yeah . went back 30 years . didn &apos;t find a match .
so we &apos;re thinking custom paint job , maybe .
okay , see ? that &apos;s ... better .
i mean , it &apos;s still kind of obvious , but it &apos;s better .
could be an older car .
what &apos;s the next step , frost ?
he &apos;s about to impress you .
we sent it to the toronto forensic lab .
okay . i &apos;m impressed .
oh , it &apos;s the largest automotive paint database in the world .
back to obvious . unimpressed .
dr. isles &apos; mom gonna make it ?
i hope so .
crime lab tech came by to bring you some photos .
yeah , she was supposed to take apart the space heater .
they found all the components but the thermal cut @-@ off switch .
what , you think somebody tampered with it ?
crime lab can &apos;t say till they have dr. isles look at it .
you really think we &apos;re looking at an arson ?
maybe .
but i don &apos;t think that arnold whistler
stopped harassing women long enough
to take a space heater apart .
maybe we should check out those fire records
that maura was asking for ,
see if there &apos;s a pattern .
will you check with arson and see what is taking them so long ?
yeah , sure .
thanks .
okay , what i &apos;m about to say doesn &apos;t leave this room .
paddy doyle &apos;s back in town .
oh , man .
for payback .
his daughter was a target in a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
and ... i didn &apos;t put a bolo out on him .
makes sense --
let him watch her back until we find out who &apos;s after her .
she &apos;s the one person we know he &apos;ll keep safe .
hell , jane , for all we know ,
this all could be connected to doyle .
a rival trying to draw him out .
i &apos;ll reach out to a southie c.i. , see what he knows .
i mean , we got to put doyle away at some point .
how &apos;s maura gonna be with that ?
after all this , i hope relieved .
did you have a nice day ?
oh , yeah . it was great . you ?
is maura okay ?
no .
are you okay ?
sort of .
i came back for one reason .
why , you need someone to drink a six @-@ pack with you ?
yeah . you .
things might have gotten a little ...
complicated .
there may be someone else .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;ll take my chances .
i came back for you .
there was something on my cheek .
was it your hand ?
you got to lay off the boxing , lady .
it &apos;s all right . i should have asked .
you don &apos;t have to ask .
mm . oh , crap .
what ?
i got to go check on maura .
anything i can do ?
yeah , um , you can go away .
you &apos;re very distracting .
no , you know what ?
um , actually ...
actually , there is somethg you can do for me .
i don &apos;t really want to go away .
no , come on . no , it &apos;s not that .
can you just be gabriel ?
please .
oh , my god . you just said my name .
that &apos;s so weird .
come on .
just ... not be agent dean .
can you do that for me , please ?
yeah .
paddy doyle is back in town .
patrick doyle .
you think the hit @-@ and @-@ run is connected to him ?
i mean , if one of his enemies wanted to get back at him ,
maura &apos;s the perfect target .
and things could get a little ugly , huh ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re telling me .
yeah . how will i protect her ?
paddy doyle is one of the fbi &apos;s most wanted fugitives .
oh , god . okay .
well , i guess we &apos;ll always have south boston .
so that &apos;s it ?
i ... i pursue an organized crime boss ,
and you and i are ...
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know , dean .
but this always happens .
i gave you my word i &apos;d just be me .
i won &apos;t do anything until you tell me i can .
i &apos;m not leaving until you finish those pancakes .
i added quinoa . dr. oz says they &apos;re very good for you .
thank you .
you &apos;re here .
her vitals stabilized .
she &apos;s still critical ,
but she &apos;s a little better .
i really had to get back to work .
good .
hey , ma , can i have some pancakes ?
yeah . i @-@ i tried a new recipe .
how are they ?
gritty .
yuck .
&quot; yuck &quot; ? what do i do with &quot; yuck &quot; ?
do you have any macaroni and cheese ?
for breakfast ?
yeah .
dr. oz would not approve .
mac and cheese has a very high fat content ,
empty calories due to white flour .
do you have to ruin everything ?
sorry .
my mother would never let me eat anything like that .
well , you were deprived .
i used to think that kids
who had bologna on white bread were lucky .
turns out i was the lucky one .
i used to think that kids who had really big allowances
and never had to go to church were lucky .
turns out they were .
that would probably be a lot better
with some grated pecorino romano .
yeah.i got ketchup .
thanks , ma .
hey , jane . i got &apos; em .
hey . maura .
you okay ?
yeah .
thank you .
toronto lab found something .
the transfer paint on your mom &apos;s watch
matched &quot; black diamond &quot; ?
that &apos;s an old paint used on &apos; 70s police cruisers .
that &apos;s encouraging .
i mean , how many 40 @-@ year @-@ old cars
are still on the road ?
can you take this upstairs to frost ?
tell him to put out a bolo .
we &apos;re looking for a 1970s old chevy impala .
copy that .
thanks .
okay . so , i have to tell you something .
i told agent dean that paddy is back in town .
well , you have to do what you have to do .
okay , but he &apos;s not gonna do anything until i tell him to ,
because ... i told gabriel instead of agent dean .
thank you .
arson squad sent over the fire incident reports .
this isn &apos;t even all of them , jane .
all right . we &apos;ll divide them up .
about 400 have already been investigated
by the arson squad .
the rest were ruled accidental .
great . that only leaves us 3,700 .
they found the car !
how do you know ?
same model , same paint .
excellent . come on , let &apos;s go .
kind of reminds me of the blues brothers car .
w @-@ who are the blues brothers ?
you did not just say that .
no prints . it &apos;s wiped clean .
do you recognize it ?
no . all i saw was the headlights and the tail lights .
all right . well , those are definitely hair .
and this is blood .
maura , it &apos;s okay . we got this . all right ?
i wanted to see it ,
i know it &apos;s just an inanimate object . i just --
it &apos;s okay to be upset .
no , come on .
i can &apos;t cry at work . it &apos;s unprofessional .
i &apos;m just gonna go to the hospital .
i &apos;m gonna have a uniform follow you home .
jane ?
yeah .
transmission fluid .
nobody &apos;s driven this for a while .
yeah , there &apos;s a trail of it .
car must have broke down .
that &apos;s why he left it here .
no plates or tags , no vin number .
vehicles made before 1981 just had an i.d. tag .
how we gonna trace it ?
we can &apos;t without the tag .
what is this ?
it &apos;s like a decal or an emblem was here .
can you put some fingerprint powder right there ?
good idea .
might stick to the adhesive there .
yeah .
what was here ?
uh , can you take some pictures of this ?
a lot of &apos; em .
got something .
what is that ?
a washer for something .
there &apos;s a stain on the floor mat on this side .
doesn &apos;t look like blood .
hey , could you collect the floor mat
and swab it before you take it to the lab ?
i think our bad guy was in a hurry .
she &apos;s doing much better .
it was nice meeting you , mr. isles .
you told her you &apos;re my father ?
i said i &apos;m your uncle .
i wanted to keep an eye on your mom
while you checked out the perp &apos;s car .
how did you know that ?
i don &apos;t miss anything if it relates to you .
i never knew you were there .
i wanted to be the kind of man
who could be this little girl &apos;s dad .
so why weren &apos;t you ?
i couldn &apos;t be anything but what i was --
a low @-@ class thug from south boston .
my dad , my uncles , hell , my grandfather --
all irish mob .
and i grew up wanting to be just like them .
until i met your mom .
i mean your birth mom .
she was so different , so ... special .
i wanted to be good enough for her .
why did she give me up ?
she was only 18 .
she was brilliant , like you .
what the hell did she see in you ?
you know how many times i &apos;ve asked myself that ?
mom ?
mom ?
maura ?
what &apos;s happened ?
mom , you &apos;ve been in an accident .
somebody was here ...
talking to me ...
telling me ...
i must live for my daughter .
was it patrick ?
patrick ?
hey . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m distracting myself
because if i don &apos;t fill my brain with &quot; useless &quot; information ,
i start crying , okay ?
okay .
uh , any idea what this is ?
where &apos;d you find it ?
i thought maybe one of my techs misplaced it
when they took the heater apart .
how &apos;s that possible ? we just found it .
no , this is the thermal cutoff switch
from this space heater .
for this space heat ?
yes . where did you find it ?
in the car that hit your mother .
what ?
a @-@ are you sure ?
yeah .
so whoever tried to kill you in that car
started the fire .
why would i be a target ?
but think about the timeline , okay ?
the arson squad says it &apos;s an accident .
you ask to check the space heater .
and then , next thing you know ,
a hit @-@ and @-@ run driver is taking a shot at you .
i have results on the stain in the suspect &apos;s car .
thanks .
dextromethorphan , guaifenesin , glycerol .
commonly referred to ,
for those of us with a phd in organic chemistry , as ... ?
cough syrup .
great .
low @-@ oxygen fires don &apos;t burn at a temperature
necessary to do this to his gloves .
i can &apos;t explain the damage to his airway , either .
sorry , dr. isles , but you said you wanted
the gas chromatography results when they were in .
thank you .
this is the analysis of the substances
i found on craig hill &apos;s face shield .
there &apos;s something here .
gas chromatography is used
to separate and analyze compounds
that can be vaporized .
could you say that in earthling ?
there are trace levels of potassium permanganate
on his face shield .
even more earthling .
you see this ?
cough syrup .
we found traces of that in the hit @-@ and @-@ run driver &apos;s car .
glycerol is the chief ingredient in cough syrup .
this is potassium permanganate .
watch this .
stand back .
when glycerol is used as an accelerant ,
potassium permanganate becomes extremely combustible .
no kidding .
the outside edge of craig hill &apos;s face shield
was coated in it .
and then glycerol was added .
the cough syrup .
so somebody must have thrown it in his face .
that &apos;s why his face shield melted .
but what about his gloves ? why &apos;d they catch fire ?
well , it &apos;s possible the gloves ignited
because they were coated , too .
so he never had a chance .
somebody wanted him dead .
somebody who was in the fire with him .
maybe it was personal .
maybe .
bunch of white guys sued the boston fire department in 2001 .
claimed that their affirmative action hiring plan
was discriminatory .
craig hill was african american .
not bad for the old white guy .
now , that &apos;s harassment , frost .
what , the &quot; old &quot; part or the &quot; white &quot; part ?
find out if any of the firefighters
from engine company 15 were part of that lawsuit
before korsak sues you , frost .
here &apos;s the original complaint . yeah , jim grant .
he was named .
we talked to him .
he fought the whistler fire with craig hill .
how many times i got to tell you ?
check my damn alibi .
we are . and it &apos;s a good one , jim .
consoling dead firefighter &apos;s wife .
ask her .
you didn &apos;t like the fact that craig hill
had a lower test score ,
but he was hired before you , did you ?
no . would you ?
no .
wasn &apos;t craig &apos;s fault .
department changed its policy .
my dad was a firefighter . my granddad .
and they &apos;re telling me &quot; no &quot; because of the color of skin ?
alibi checks out .
craig hill &apos;s widow said he was there
at the time of the hit @-@ and @-@ run .
hit @-@ and @-@ run ?
i thought we were talking about a fire .
you can go now .
craig was a damn fine firefighter .
we all miss him .
we &apos;re sorry for your loss , man .
this is what was on the back of the hit @-@ and @-@ run car .
one of these .
that &apos;s a st. florian cross .
boston firefighters union used to
hand these out in the &apos; 70s .
well , none of them are old enough .
maybe it was a legacy .
yeah , jim grant said his dad and granddad
were boston firefighters .
one of them could have given him the cross .
no , grant &apos;s got an airtight alibi .
it &apos;s got to be someone from engine company 15 .
well , we could interrogate all of them .
no , you can &apos;t .
there &apos;s not gonna be any more interrogations .
grant complained to his union ,
and every firefighter in the city is lawyered up .
and they &apos;re pissed at us .
well , that &apos;s not good .
no , it &apos;s not .
oh , thanks .
this is the last of the arson squad &apos;s fire reports
from last year .
they &apos;re all from engine company 15 --
where were they ?
that &apos;s weird . craig hill had them checked out .
our victim ?
craig hill is looking into every fire
that his company responded to in the last year ,
and then he ends up dead ?
what the hell was he about to find ?
carbon build @-@ up , electrical fire ,
water heater explosion --
all of these were ruled as accidental .
happens all the time .
nothing i &apos;m looking at looks suspicious , either .
okay , but here &apos;s what &apos;s weird .
all of these fires started at 6 : 00 a.m ...
on a tuesday in district 21 .
does anybody know what &apos;s special
about tuesday in that district ?
garbage day is all i can think of .
yeah .
and the fires all began at commercial businesses
in the early morning before garbage pick @-@ up .
yeah . and what &apos;s a great source of fuel for a fire ?
garbage .
so craig hill must have figured out
that somebody was deliberately setting fires in his district .
somebody that was good enough
to make them look accidental .
so when i requested the files to review them ,
i became the next target .
so now what do we do ?
well , our suspect is probably a firefighter .
we got to flush him out .
how ?
i might have an idea .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry for this , but as the medical examiner ,
i am entitled to collect forensic evidence
from city property .
anything else ? my men aren &apos;t too happy .
i can see that .
and i &apos;m sorry .
there is something else .
i &apos;d like the plans for the whistler factory .
more evidence collection ?
yes .
look , i can &apos;t guarantee the safety of that building .
it &apos;s quite all right . i know what i &apos;m doing .
thank you .
you looking for where craig died ?
yes .
it &apos;s kevin flynn .
we found him right about here .
and my grandfather died fighting the &apos; 72 vendome fire .
i &apos;m sorry .
city kept cutting back and cutting back .
how do you fight all these fires
without enough firefighters , huh ?
you followed me ?
you shouldn &apos;t have come here by yourself .
why not ?
you know why not .
i had to make sure people understand
that they just can &apos;t keep laying us off .
how did you do that , kevin ?
you know how . i burned a few buildings .
and then craig started digging around .
just like you .
you both should have just left it alone .
kevin , don &apos;t !
drop your weapon , doyle !
gabriel , no !
no !
what the hell ?
no !
&lt; i &gt; let in the day after a dark night &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; if you &apos;re still here &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; if you &apos;re still here &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; let in the day &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; if you &apos;re not done trying &lt; / i &gt;
maura !
&lt; i &gt; if you &apos;re still here , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you &apos;re not done trying &lt; / i &gt;
hope ...
hope ? what do you hope ?
hope ...
maura !
&quot; hope ... &quot; what do you hope ?
oh , god . maura ...
don &apos;t touch him !
maura
no , i mean it !
don &apos;t you dare touch him .
&lt; i &gt; you &apos;re not done dying &lt; / i &gt;
