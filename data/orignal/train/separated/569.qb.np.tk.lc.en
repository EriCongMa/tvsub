第二季 第五集
abed , guess who &apos;s got two thumbs
and has an exciting career opportunity for you ?
this guy .
i &apos;m pointing my thumbs at god .
i &apos;m using one thumb to say that &apos;s great .
um , i told my pastor about youtube
and how there &apos;s no light there for the kids ,
and our church wants to sponsor
the making of a viral video with a christian message .
ha ! what are you gonna do , &quot; rapping jesus &quot; ?
pierce , please just step aside
and make room for a new generation .
um , abed , would you like to make a christian youtube ?
i know you &apos;re muslim .
as a muslim , i &apos;d be happy to do it .
as a filmmaker , no way .
i &apos;m a storyteller , not a preacher .
well , the bible has been called the greatest story ever told .
ben lyons said the same thing about i am legend .
oh , well , i &apos;ll have to rent that , then .
whoa .
what ?
that &apos;s a lot of pasta for no veggies .
you &apos;re not in charge of what i eat .
that &apos;s true . britta !
and some damn broccoli , please .
pierce has been acting out a lot lately .
maybe you should talk to him .
how is that my job ?
aren &apos;t you , like , the dad ?
would the dad walk away from this conversation ?
no ?
you &apos;re having cookies for lunch ?
yeah .
hey , you didn &apos;t pay for those .
call a cop .
heads up , gay wads .
hey !
cookies !
fresh and stolen .
what are you looking at ?
your face .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to look at .
so ?
so ? you gonna sit down or what ?
oh , no , i usually sit with the younger people .
well , la de da de da .
no , no , we watch videos on &quot; youtune , &quot;
and you guys probably don &apos;t even know what that is .
we don &apos;t care .
pierce , are you looking for us ?
we &apos;re sitting over there .
i can see !
sheesh ! did you take your pills ?
ooh !
mama &apos;s boy .
we &apos;re having a private conversation here .
oh . oh , i &apos;m sorry . um , hi .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m britta , pierce &apos;s--
very nice meeting you guys .
&quot; very nice meeting you guys . &quot;
she &apos;s a lesbian .
shirley .
hmm ?
i read the new testament .
the whole thing ?
you know , being raised by tv and movies ,
i always thought that jesus just walked on water
and told people not to have abortions ,
but it &apos;s so much cooler than that .
he was like e.t. , edward scissorhands ,
and marty mcfly combined .
i would love to make a jesus movie .
oh , abed , that &apos;s wonderful !
what do you think we should do ?
it needs to be cool and addictive ,
like that video of the kitten falling asleep .
absolutely .
but the story &apos;s been told to death ,
so i want to approach it in a new way .
we need a jesus movie for the post post @-@ modern world .
like jesus as a rapper ?
no .
i want to tell the story of jesus
from the perspective of a filmmaker exploring the life of jesus .
that sounds very appealing to filmmakers .
see , in the filmmaker &apos;s film , jesus is a filmmaker
trying to find god with his camera .
but then the filmmaker realizes that he &apos;s actually jesus
and he &apos;s being filmed by god &apos;s camera .
and it goes like that forever in both directions ,
like a mirror in a mirror ,
because all of the filmmakers are jesus ,
and all their cameras are god ,
and the movie is called abed .
all caps .
filmmaking beyond film . a metafilm .
my masterpiece .
but i don &apos;t like it .
well , that &apos;s okay .
you know , you &apos;re reacting the way the world did to jesus .
i &apos;m reacting the way the world does
to movies about making movies about making movies .
i mean , come on , charlie kaufman ,
some of us have work in the morning , damn .
does this mean you don &apos;t want to work on the movie ?
this means there is no movie .
this is the movie .
the game is jacks and deuces wild .
except if the dean comes in , and then it &apos;s bingo .
keep it . i &apos;ve got another one .
if you get caught with that ,
just say it &apos;s your 90th birthday .
suddenly , it &apos;s adorable .
that &apos;s right .
all right , now . what is this again ?
b @-@ 19 .
no . b @-@ 19 , my butt .
i told you guys no poker , all right ?
shut this down !
shut your mouth down , fruit .
oh , hey , unacceptable , and none of your business ,
and barely the whole truth .
all right , everyone go home .
excuse me , mister ?
what , pierce ?
what year is it ?
what ?
poker helps him remember .
veronica .
you are okay , kid .
go ahead and deal . let &apos;s go .
jesus , did you really die for our sins ?
that &apos;s dopey .
oh , uh , dope .
ooh , freudian slip ,
perhaps due to my feeling kind of dopey .
do the line , atheist .
jesus , did you really die for our sins ?
that &apos;s dope .
you think that &apos;s dope ?
check out these ... beatitudes .
blessed be the peacemakers , word to the meek ,
the kingdom of heaven is open all week ,
jesus and me were--
i have arrived !
i am watched , as i am watching .
i am audience and creation .
the earth shall know my power !
abed , what are you doing ?
oh , great ! you blew the take !
no , no , keep rolling .
this can all be part of it .
there are no takes .
there is no viewer .
the film is the story .
the story is us .
we are the film .
it &apos;s totally meta .
well , let &apos;s get back
to our non @-@ meta production , shall we ?
come on .
no , i want to watch this .
troy , there &apos;s no time .
then , we quit . right , britta ?
i don &apos;t even believe in god ,
but i love me some abed .
yeah .
wait , wait .
&quot; the story of the story is the story . &quot;
sure , that &apos;ll play in poughkeepsie .
i heard some theaters are gonna show it in reverse .
i heard it &apos;s the same movie backward and forward .
i heard the deleted scenes are the scenes
and the scenes are the deleted scenes .
i heard jesus died for our sins .
oh , hey , guys ,
the director &apos;s answering questions in the cafeteria ,
and it both is and isn &apos;t part of the movie !
get a table !
abed , are we all in the movie right now ?
we are all in a movie , even when there are no cameras .
when will the movie be released ?
when is life released ?
every minute of our lives is a world premiere ,
and my father has already bought the popcorn .
whoa !
excuse me , abed , but you aren &apos;t actually trying to say
that you &apos;re jesus , are you ?
i am who you say i am .
oh , man .
okay , yeah , ooh , it &apos;s meta now .
except here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m a devout christian , and you guys
are feeding into this poor boy &apos;s delusions .
so cool ! she &apos;s atual real life pharisee !
hey , bitch , why don &apos;t you go back to your temple ?
why don &apos;t you all stop confusing jesus
with an egotistical filmmaking lunatic ?
i forgive her .
so , how &apos;s your film going , abed ?
blasphemously .
it &apos;s not blasphemy to say that we are god , shirley .
first corinthians :
&quot; he who unites himself with the lord
is one with him in spirit . &quot;
did you just scripture me , muslim ?
jesus was jewish .
are you ever gonna let that go ?
hey . no religious talk .
somebody &apos;s late .
what is that in your pocket ?
jeff , britta , pierce is smoking cigars .
what &apos;s it to you , butt @-@ breath ?
look at your eyes .
have you been out all night with those hipsters ?
hipsters ?
that pack of old people that hang out in the cafeteria .
people call them hipsters
&apos;cause they all have hip replacements .
they do not .
leonard could probably kick your ass .
leonard ?
you &apos;re hanging out with leonard ?
you know i hate him .
so ? everybody hates him .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s cool .
you people don &apos;t get it .
well , pierce , i &apos;m not sure that i want to get it ,
and i think you ought to take a break
from these new friends of yours .
they &apos;ve got you all riled up .
that &apos;s what leonard said you &apos;d say .
well , leonard is not a part of this study group ,
so you apologize right now to--
what ? ah ! i &apos;m not your father !
i never said you were !
where are you going ?
out !
when did pierce become awesome ?
i am gonna shut you down , you know that ?
i do .
oh ! oh , i get it !
i &apos;m supposed to shut you down .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do it .
don &apos;t .
i won &apos;t .
good .
i am gonna shut you down .
good .
you should have seen his face .
he was terrified .
you &apos;re his worst nightmare now .
you &apos;re old and you don &apos;t give a damn .
booyah !
don &apos;t make eye contact , and we &apos;ll be fine .
mmm , here comes the boss !
the dean has got a date .
what a lovely couple .
please , give us a break , will you ?
i don &apos;t want to see you hipsters when i come back out here !
go ! run , run . we made them angry .
we &apos;ve made them angry .
hey , he left his keys .
ooh , who &apos;s up for a joyride ?
hell yeah .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
we could get into some serious trouble here .
oh , come on .
we get caught ,
we can just pretend we &apos;re disoriented ,
and he can give us a ride home .
where am i ? what year is it ?
but we &apos;ve all been drinking .
oh , grow a schmekel .
okay , everyone , this is the last scene .
i want to thank you all for contributing in your small way
to the greatest film ever made .
and on the seventh day , shirley shut down production .
abed , shirley has informed me
that you are using school equipment
on school property to make a religious film .
she has filed an official complaint ,
invoking the separation of church and state .
i pointed out the irony to her already .
don &apos;t give a crap . let &apos;s be ironic .
shut it down .
okay .
abed , are you making a religious film ?
all movies are religious to me .
nice . but is it a movie about jesus ?
is the matrix ? is robocop ?
is superman returns ?
all stories are about death and resurrection .
i &apos;ve got one . wrath of khan , hmm ?
that &apos;s a good one .
spock sacrifices himself for the crew and gets reborn .
how captivating was ricardo montalban in that ?
except in abed &apos;s film , the character &apos;s name isn &apos;t spock !
that &apos;s true . it &apos;s abed .
oh . i &apos;m getting creative goose bumps here .
i love charlie kaufman .
i need to run into editing for one second ,
but if you want , we can grab you a chair
and you can watch a take .
i would love that .
i &apos;ve never watched a take before .
this is exciting .
uh , you--
say what you will about abed ,
but the man cannot be killed .
i mean , it &apos;s almost like he &apos;s jesus .
i got it .
i don &apos;t think we should be driving .
i mean , we &apos;re all , you know , old and groggy .
god , stop worrying .
richard flew zeroes during the big one .
what do you mean , &quot; flew zeroes &quot; ?
he &apos;s not japanese .
well , what did you fly during the big one , rich ?
where am i ?
oh , come on . stop farting around .
seriously , i don &apos;t know where i am .
what year is it ?
how do i drive ?
let &apos;s bail .
wait a minute . what about richard ?
screw richard ! it &apos;s every man for himself !
richard , are you all right ?
well , am i richard ?
yes .
then i &apos;m fine .
but who were those people that ran away ?
our friends ?
that &apos;s a good question .
what is ?
there are no takes . there is no viewer .
the film is the story . the story is us .
we are the film .
so , what do you think ?
i need to take a walk .
dear god , my movie is the worst piece of crap
i have ever seen in my entire life .
how could i have been so blind ?
it &apos;s a self @-@ indulgent , adolescent mess .
i can barely sit through it .
and now , with all this hype ,
i &apos;ve got a real snakes on a plane brewing .
the critics are gonna crucify me .
my career will be over before it begins .
god , if you &apos;re out there , i know i don &apos;t deserve it ,
but i need your help .
please take this project away from me .
make it rain , send a meteor ,
anything . please ?
now ?
okay , i get it . this is what i deserve .
i &apos;ll finish it up .
hi , i &apos;m pierce hawthorne &apos;s emergency contact .
you &apos;re here to pick him up ?
no , no .
i &apos;m here to be removed as his emergency contact .
one second .
hey , i got a class !
where is everybody ?
is anyone coming to get leonard ?
no . nobody comes for him anymore .
his kids asked us to stop calling them .
why do you think he acts like that ?
so we &apos;re in prison , right ?
all right , bring him out .
over here , pierce . come on . book .
go wait in the car .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
go . wait . in . the . car .
you want me to change that or not ?
i guess not .
uh , but , um , could you do me a favor ?
could you add britta perry as a contact ?
p @-@ e @-@ r @-@ r @-@ y .
and would you give her a call a couple of times a week ?
she gets pretty worried about him .
and , uh , she works days , so make sure you call at night .
everyone thinks what you did was destined to happen ,
that it was proof that god was making my movie ,
a movie so good , it could never exist .
they think i &apos;m a genius , and they think you &apos;re a villain .
you heard me praying .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
oh , this is gonna be good !
abed sent me a new link ,
and that man knows his video virality .
so you &apos;re just gonna drop all pretense
of actually teaching us ?
yeah . here we go .
blessed be the peacemakers , word to the meek ,
the kingdom of heaven is open all week .
you finished my movie .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
you humble me .
you humble me too .
okay , open your books ,
because abed has broken the internet .
great .
so which one of us is gonna head home
and change ?
hilarious .
so you guys bought one of my outfits
and then staked out my apartment
every day until i wore it ?
that &apos;s not pathetic .
okay .
good job .
i guess i &apos;m heading home to change now .
oh , i hit traffic . did i miss it ?
