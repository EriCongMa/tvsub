第二十三季 第十一集
每天都有新惊喜
so what are we doing here ?
what , is it the thing where the family runs in and sits down ?
that &apos;s it ?
we flew you in and put you up for that ?
i , i think we &apos;re done here .
paul .
lisa simpson , your actions have brought devastation
upon this town ,
and all because of your selfish desire
to be accepted by others .
leave her alone .
that &apos;s my only talking daughter .
lethal inject her on the electric chair .
bart , it &apos;s okay to say that at home but not in court .
take it back .
withdrawn .
now , lisa , tell your side of the story , and use your big voice .
well , it all started a couple of months ago .
your honor , i &apos;d like to request
that everyone in the court picture in their minds
what the witness is describing .
i &apos;ll allow it , but no flights of fancy .
like all too many stories about my family ,
it began with somebody watching television .
well , mcbain , you certainly picked a bad time
to come out of retirement .
i hope you have a cobra plan .
you are suffering from a reptile dysfunction .
down in front .
damn it , why do kids have heads ?
homie , stop watching the movie in the other people &apos;s car .
oh , but i &apos;m invested in the characters .
you &apos;ll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall .
i make my own turnoffs .
and that , kids , is how you stick it
to the towne centre real estate investment trust .
no , no , no .
someone thinks we &apos;re leaving .
i &apos;ll wave them off .
no , no , no , no , let &apos;s see how long we can keep &apos; em waiting .
everyone act like we &apos;re buckling up to go home .
homie .
marge , if you were married to da vinci ,
you wouldn &apos;t tell him not to da vinch .
damn it , are you leaving or not ? !
leaving ?
why on earth would you think that ?
we totally wasted his time .
and ours .
this place is so great .
when the trolley hits you , it doesn &apos;t even hurt .
you try it , maggie .
ooh , condos .
lenny , do you live here ?
yeah , i just moved in .
i have a drippin &apos; dots for breakfast every morning ;
at lunch , i get a massage in front of strangers ;
and then i spend the afternoon browsing cell phone skins .
ever get tired of those dancing waters ?
the day i moved in .
so what are we all going to do together ?
actually , we just came to do some shopping as a family .
oh , no worries .
mr. mall can make his own excitement .
give me one doll from every time period ,
and set me up for a tea party in a private room .
lenny , you asked me to stop you from coming back in here .
let me help you .
you can help me by giving me ellis island emily .
hi , dear , i &apos;m your uncle lenny .
i &apos;m going to buy you an all @-@ new wardrobe ,
fix your teeth , send you to the best schools ,
and you &apos;re going to hate and resent me for it
&apos;cause you &apos;re an american now .
i was hanging on to these gift cards as investments ,
but then half the companies went out of business .
better sort those out .
礼品卡面值50元
do @-@ over .
unspool it into my mouth
till that card is at zero .
draw the curtain .
sir , as a complexion scientist ,
i must advise you against using any more .
this is the most powerful hydrator we sell .
less blathering , more slathering .
watch it !
yo , bart dude .
can i get a ride to the food court ?
hop on .
i kind of want to create my own thing .
do you sell any just plain sets ?
no . we do all the imagining for you .
well , i &apos;ll just buy one of these
and build something different .
you do and you &apos;d better build yourself a lawyer .
miss simpson , does the court really need to hear
everything that happened
in every store your family visited ?
trust me , i &apos;ve left a lot out
and cleaned up the swears .
anyway , i ran into some schoolmates
and thought they might be friendly .
that &apos;s what kids do , right , hang out at the mall together ?
but when i went over ...
hi , guys , what are you doing ?
duh , having feathers woven into our hair .
those girls are snotty and shallow .
tell them off .
can i join you ?
lisa , how can we put this ?
you &apos;re the reason no one wears silly bandz anymore .
wha ... ? they , they don &apos;t ?
what the ... ?
enough .
i don &apos;t trust this place .
where are the cashiers ?
yeah , the lightest , most desirable computer
in the world for the next three weeks : the mapple void .
i &apos;ll take it , provided you charge me
for services that google offers for free .
i already have .
sweet .
this computer is so great .
i &apos;m watching the latest sofia coppola movie
at 20x speed to make it seem like a normal movie .
i think it just froze .
oh , no , no , that bird just moved .
uh @-@ oh , a draggy backpack .
i have no friends .
sweetie , hey , why don &apos;t you make friends with my new computer ?
okay .
let me just finish downloading the complete works of shakespeare .
now who &apos;s the greatest writer of all time ?
i &apos;d have more friends if i knew what people liked ,
but i won &apos;t know what people like unless i &apos;m their friend .
it &apos;s a conundrum .
helpful hint : if you want friends ,
don &apos;t use words like &quot; conundrum . &quot;
co @-@ what @-@ drum ?
jimbo heard me say it .
i &apos;m dead .
it &apos;s easier to be friends with lots of people online
than one person in person .
what if i started an online meeting place ,
where all are equal and i am the undisputed center ?
how &apos;s this for a conundrum ?
it &apos;s not really a conundrum .
sit at my feet and i will elaborate .
so , to summarize , your honor ,
lisa simpson created this &quot; social network , &quot;
because she had no friends .
no , that is not true .
i ...
may i remind you you &apos;re under oath ?
all right already .
i had no friends .
with a attitude like that , i wouldn &apos;t be her friend .
life is too dang short .
so , since i had no friends ,
i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network .
did we become friends ?
no .
计算机的荣誉之家
as the ceo of springface ,
i want you all to have fun as you write source code
until you fall asleep at your consoles .
delightful .
here &apos;s my favorite computer game : angry nerds .
nelson , is there any way i could be your friend ?
the only way i would be your friend is
if i could click a box under your picture saying
&quot; accept friendship request from . &quot;
nelson , you &apos;ve just given us the template for our site .
i don &apos;t care .
if we don &apos;t move ,
his odds of getting us both are 374 to one .
bye .
now , to skip ahead ,
your diabolical plan was an instant success .
i never said it was diabolical .
withdrawn .
this social network quickly
unified the disparate children of springfield unified .
oh , i just got invited to make out with shauna .
see ?
that went out to 200 guys .
and seven girls .
santa &apos;s little helper &apos;s friends with snowball two ?
now i &apos;ve seen everything .
ha , all my friends have birthdays this year .
i just un @-@ friended skinner
doggone it .
i &apos;m less popular than the hornet &apos;s nest in the gym .
you said you were getting rid of that nest .
we trade the honey for chalk and yardsticks .
hornets make honey ?
better than wasp honey , not as good as bee .
is this how you talk on dates ?
i wish my dates were this interesting .
hit refresh .
在线人数
hit refresh .
i have a thousand friends .
and only eight of them are milhouse .
a thousand kids ?
if you could get each of them to send you a dollar ,
you &apos;d be a millionaire .
well , it &apos;s not just kids using springface ,
it &apos;s moms like me , marge .
wait a minute , grownups are on this ?
yeah , look .
we &apos;ve got to thank you , kiddo .
we &apos;ve gotten so much more action since we signed up
and used this picture of ourselves .
that &apos;s not you .
you can see our reflection in the sunglasses .
wow , i &apos;ve created something incredibly popular .
and i &apos;ve created something
that created something incredibly popular .
and i created an alcoholic hippo .
you never showed it to me .
a stupid alcoholic hippo .
i still want to see it .
there is no hippo .
then why did you say it ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re the hippo .
are you just saying that
&apos;cause you don &apos;t want me to see the hippo ?
i don &apos;t have a hippo !
and so , this so @-@ called &quot; springface &quot;
spread from the world of children to adults .
man , this web site makes talking drunk
to my wife so much safer .
i am sitting here ...
zero sheets to the wind ...
... counting the moments to closing time
when i can stumble home to you .
another round , moe .
uh @-@ oh , did i type that ?
delete ! delete !
hm , typing &quot; delete &quot; does not delete .
it is gratifying to see all of you bowing in prayer ,
the light of god shining on your faces .
uh @-@ oh , bernice hibbert keeps &quot; liking &quot; bumblebee man &apos;s posts .
that &apos;s how it starts .
why did i make this church a wi @-@ fi hotspot ?
if you can &apos;t beat &apos; em , join &apos; em .
let &apos;s see , which muppet am i ?
beaker ?
hm , i guess that &apos;s fair .
friend , friend ,
awaiting reply , friend ...
sherri ? terri ?
hopscotch ?
double dutch ?
ringolivio ?
anyone ?
oh , i have a thousand friends ,
and i feel more alone than ever .
i am trying to set a mood here .
so , to sum up ,
lisa &apos;s social network
turned into the biggest internet failure since ...
well , there &apos;ve been so many .
&quot; ask jeeves , &quot; anyone ?
and so springface became too big to control ,
just like the 60 @-@ foot baby in my self @-@ published novel ,
the 60 ft . baby .
order it online now ,
while you can still cheat the government on sales tax .
as i was saying ,
springface was used in ways i never expected .
thanks for springfacing me your head cleaver , bart.
check this out : i &apos;m hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses ,
so when kearney loots their ammo ,
he gets a face full of ass shrapnel .
damn , i got ass @-@ shrapped !
what the ... ? !
that idiot cut me off .
i &apos;m gonna run his plates ,
find out who he is ,
then change his springface profile picture to a shot of a monkey .
chuckle get that , marge ?
a monkey !
homer , watch the road .
right .
status update : homer ... is ... watching ... the ...
dislike ! dislike !
somebody call 911 !
i don &apos;t know how to use the phone on my phone .
hey , did you guys get my picture of the fire ?
yeah , i did . nice grab .
i didn &apos;t get it yet .
yeah , funny how that works .
lisa simpson , can you give us any reason
why the city should not force you to shut down your site ?
i know it &apos;s awful and insular
and caused 35 deaths , but i had friends .
four digits of friends !
i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell .
he friends everybody .
fine .
i &apos;ll shut down the site .
time to get a life .
we don &apos;t need your crummy web site .
we can make anything into guns .
lisa .
lisa !
want to play marco polo with us ?
we just realized you don &apos;t have to play in a pool .
you really want me ?
no .
we want your dad .
marco .
come on , lisa .
polo !
fish out of water .
虽然他没做什么
重要的是有多少人在春田推特上关注你
hey , winklevosses .
you &apos;re gonna lose yet again .
you should see the expression on your faces .
oh , wait , you can .
they &apos;re fat , they smoke ,
they started training a week ago .
why can &apos;t we pull away ?
because we can &apos;t stop concentrating
on that $ 65 million facebook settlement ,
which somehow wasn &apos;t enough for us .
even though we were rich in the first place .
so long , you big babies !
hope you like the taste of silver !
help us , larry summers !
come on , wonder twin !
pull !
and now , for a simpsons &quot; show &apos;s too short &quot; story .
once there was a young rascal named bart.
this lad was trouble from the very start .
when it came to mischief , he had a black thumb .
it didn &apos;t hurt that his daddy was dumb .
and when it came to best friends ,
it was milhouse who picked him .
sometimes the sidekick , sometimes the victim .
then one day at school engulfed in ennui ,
bart dreamed of wrapping the place in t.p.
so off to the discount store they did skulk .
with the evil intent of buying in bulk .
they went to the school and put up a ladder .
only to wait for milhouse &apos;s bladder .
all that evening they unfurled with delight .
and soon the school was covered in white .
the mischievous boys had done their best .
when an eagle approached , needing a nest .
they tried to escape with struggles and squirms .
but all they got was a diet of worms .
there they remained to this very day .
so now you know , pranks do not pay .
simpson !
