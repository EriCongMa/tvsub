for over a century , i have lived in secret .
until now . i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
elena ... she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
i want the invention .
i don &apos;t have it .
but damon does .
and you &apos;re gonna get it for me .
i &apos;m not gonna give the device to isobel .
so she can give it to john who &apos;s gonna turn around and kill me .
but it &apos;ll be useless . bonnie can take the spell off .
you took a risk with damon .
how did you know that he was going to give it to me ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s in love with you .
i couldn &apos;t do what she wanted me to do .
it wasn &apos;t right .
but when elena finds out ...
she &apos;s never going to forgive me .
this dress hurts .
suck it in , baby .
no , no , no , no .
this lineup is all wrong .
the marching band should be in front of the historical society .
matt , time to get on your float .
boys ,
i asked you to put the chairs on the founder &apos;s float .
ladies , time to get on your float .
look at you , all retro .
what are you doing here ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be here ?
bonnie deactivated the gilbert invention .
isobel &apos;s gone .
and it &apos;s founder &apos;s day .
i &apos;m here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl .
don &apos;t start with me , damon .
oh , you started it , stefan ,
with that whole &quot; i &apos;m insecure , leave elena alone &quot; speech .
i &apos;m just enjoying that .
as long as you heard it .
huh ? what ?
you have no sense of humor , stefan .
actually , i just have no sense of damon humor .
damon humor .
hey , look .
i get it . i get it .
i &apos;m the better , hotter , superior choice ,
and you &apos;re scared now that katherine &apos;s out of the picture
that i &apos;m gonna turn all my attention to elena .
but don &apos;t worry . elena is not katherine .
you &apos;re right . she &apos;s not .
anna .
look at you .
heh . i know , it &apos;s stupid , huh ?
i &apos;m part of the parade .
but how are you ?
i &apos;ve been ... been been so worried ,
and i feel awful .
why ?
you didn &apos;t kill my mother . your uncle did .
are you sure it was him ?
who else would have done it ?
he doesn &apos;t understand , anna . it &apos;s who he is .
he hates all vampires .
he &apos;s just doing what he thinks is right .
are you defending him ?
no . no way .
it &apos;s just ...
i do understand where he &apos;s coming from .
he &apos;s convinced all the tomb vampis
want revenge on this town ,
and he &apos;s just ...
he &apos;s trying to protect it .
they do want revenge .
or , at least , they did .
but that &apos;s why we separated from them .
my mom wasn &apos;t after revenge .
she just wanted her life back .
i have to get out of this town , jeremy .
you &apos;re leaving ?
but i &apos;ve been thinking . you could come with me .
i could turn you .
i mean , you said you wanted me to .
here .
it &apos;s my blood .
if you die with it in your system ,
you &apos;ll come back .
anna ...
i know you ,
what it &apos;s like for you ...
being alone , always feeling empty inside ,
no one to understand .
but when you &apos;re a vampire ,
you don &apos;t have to feel that way .
you can shut it off .
i can show you how .
i wanted to .
i did .
but i don &apos;t think i can .
i &apos;m sorry .
john ?
is ... is that even possible ?
well , there &apos;s no proof ,
but he dated isobel when she was a teenager ,
and he was the one who brought
her to your dad &apos;s office for the delivery .
my whole life , i &apos;ve never liked this man .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
i wanted to tell you before damon dropped it on you
in some typically inappropriate way .
no , i &apos;m happy that you told me . i just ...
i really hope that it &apos;s not true .
what am i supposed to do ? do i just ...
confront him and say , &quot; are you my biological father ? &quot;
i guess when you &apos;re ready .
i &apos;m never gonna be ready .
stefan , i have enough problems
with the family that i actually care about .
jeremy hates me , and why wouldn &apos;t he ?
my journal gave him every single reason to .
he &apos;s just hurt . he &apos;s confused .
he &apos;s never gonna forgive me for vicki ,
tor taking away his memory ,
for lying to him .
he &apos;s your brother . he &apos;ll forgive you .
just give him some time .
say cheese .
wait . hide your cast .
it &apos;s not era @-@ appropriate .
seriously ?
yes .
ok . all right .
i want one with bonnie now .
here , i can take it .
i &apos;ll be on the float .
i said i was sorry .
you made out with his mother , and then you beat him to a pulp .
you &apos;re gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry .
jeremy .
heh . i was wondering where you were .
you look great .
you guys did a really great job on the float .
go away , elena .
jeremy , come on , please .
i don &apos;t want it to be like this between us .
why don &apos;t you have damon erase my memory again ?
then i can go back to being your in @-@ the @-@ dark little brother .
jer , please .
just don &apos;t .
you can &apos;t fix this that easily .
something like this doesn &apos;t just get fixed .
let &apos;s give a big hand
to the mystic falls high school marching band .
and for a little local history ,
mr. saltzman &apos;s students have recreated
virginia &apos;s battle of willow creek .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome
our stunning miss mystic falls court
and their handsome escorts .
this is caroline forbes , miss mystic falls .
aren &apos;t they beautiful ?
what do you want ?
just watching the parade .
where are you going ?
away from you .
i want to say something to you .
just leave me alone .
thank you .
the device that emily spelled could have killed me .
i don &apos;t take what you did lightly , so ...
thank you .
i did it for elena .
i know that .
but i &apos;m still very grateful .
and ...
i owe you .
enjoy the parade .
let &apos;s cheer it for
the mystic falls high school football team .
let &apos;s show them our support , everybody .
this is the key .
once inserted , the device will be activated .
it will work only once for an estimated time of 5 minutes .
yes . how does it work ?
it &apos;s a high @-@ pitched frequency that humans can &apos;t hear .
any vampire within a 5 @-@ block radius
will be incapacitated , exposing them .
at that time , the sheriff &apos;s v5 deputies will inject them with vervain
and bring them here , where we &apos;ll finish them off .
and you &apos;re certain they &apos;re attacking tonight ?
i had a source . one of the vampires from the tomb ...
he confirmed the attack .
everybody listen up .
the plan stays the same .
we wait till the fireworks start .
until then , blend in . stay a part of the celebration .
they &apos;ll never see us coming .
they want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864,
which makes us their targets .
this area here is the stage .
this is where the founding families are gonna be .
any questions ?
we &apos;re taking an enormous risk .
we &apos;re talking about our families , john .
anna .
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s the only way to draw them out and kill them ...
all of them .
i like you better like this .
the period look , it ...
didn &apos;t suit you .
is that an insult ?
actually , elena , it is a compliment
of the highest order .
look , i know stefan is worried
about our friendship .
did he mention something to you , too ?
no . did he mention something to you ?
no . nothing worth repeating .
so , i think you should stop with the flirty little comments
and that eye thing that you do .
what eye thing ?
don &apos;t make me regret being your friend .
ok ?
i don &apos;t believe that we can &apos;t fix this .
i lied . i was wrong .
but you &apos;re my brother , jer , and i love you .
and i have to fix it .
so , just tell me . what can i do ?
you can go to hell , elena .
i have so many emotions , but i don &apos;t have any way to express them .
being a teenager is so hard .
you dick .
you do not talk to me like that .
i &apos;m not your sister .
and from now on , don &apos;t talk to your sister that way , either .
so , what , you &apos;re gonna kill me just &apos; cause i hurt elena &apos;s feelings ?
cut her some slack .
she erased my memories .
no , i did .
she was protecting you .
it wasn &apos;t her call to make .
let go of me before i cause a scene .
you &apos;ll be unconscious before you even got a word out .
let him go .
you all right ?
yeah .
what my brother is trying to say
is don &apos;t blame elena for this .
damon turned vicki .
i killed her .
she was a threat to you , and she was a threat to your sister .
i &apos;m sorry that it happened . i wish that it hadn &apos;t .
shouldn &apos;t have made me forget .
good cop , bad cop ... i like it .
what are you doing ? hmm ?
he was being a punk .
elena &apos;s relationship with her brother is none of your business .
you stay out of it .
oh , there &apos;s only one do @-@ gooder hero role available .
oh , my bad . i &apos;m sorry .
get over yourself .
we both know that you &apos;re not doing this for the right reasons .
see , there you go with that little jealousy act again .
uh , wh @-@ what are the right reasons , stefan ?
enlighten me . please .
well , see , damom , it &apos;s only real when it comes from your desire
to do the right thing for nothing in return .
right .
yeah . and i know that that is an entirely foreign concept to you
i completely understand how you wouldn &apos;t get it .
you want to use our town as bait ?
it &apos;s too dangerous . it &apos;s insane .
we &apos;ve gone over the plans with your deputies .
they &apos;re all on board .
you &apos;ve gone behind me ?
yeah , because we knew that &apos;s exactly how you &apos;d react .
our children are here .
liz , we need to do this .
we have no choice . this is the reason for the secret council .
our founding fathers created
the secret council for just this purpose .
i &apos;m the sheriff . it &apos;s my call .
and i say no .
richard , let me speak to the sheriff alone .
john , you &apos;re not thinking clearly .
i &apos;m not gonna change my mind about this .
you &apos;re still around ?
there &apos;s something you need to know .
the vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight .
how do you know this ?
i went to them .
they think i &apos;m with them , but i &apos;m not .
they want the founding families dead .
when is this supposed to happen ?
when the fireworks start .
john gilbert wants to use that invention on them .
wait . then we can &apos;t be here .
it doesn &apos;t work . it &apos;s been deactivated .
well , then a lot of people are gonna die .
where are they right now ?
they &apos;re already here , damon .
remember , we don &apos;t know which of them ingest vervain .
it &apos;s not about the feed .
it &apos;s about the kill .
you know what to do .
rick .
yeah .
you keep those nifty little vamp weapons n the car ?
yeah . why do you ask ?
because this square is crawling with tomb vampires .
i think we might need a stake or two .
got it .
uh , what are you doing ?
saving your life .
15 words or less ...
tomb vamps are here .
founding families are the target .
get her out of here . now .
wait . wait . where are you going ?
that &apos;s more than 15 words , stefan .
wait . jeremy &apos;s out here somewhere .
let &apos;s go find him . come on .
there was this time freshman year
when bonnie and i were in a fight .
and we swore that we would never talk again .
caroline , give it a rest .
thanks .
what are you doing here ? i told you to go home .
i decided not to .
if i tell you to do something , you do it .
get off me .
mayor . is everything ok ?
please , tyler , i need you to go home . now .
take your friends with you .
but why ? what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t explain .
all of you need to get home . now .
please .
yeah , ok .
here .
take my car .
it &apos;s out back .
come on . caroline , matt , go with him .
anna , what are you doing here ?
my uncle could see you ...
i don &apos;t care about that .
i needed to find you . come here .
for 150 years ,
mystic falls has been the kind of town
that everybody wants to call home ...
safe , prosperous , welcoming .
and we have the founders to thank for that .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;d like
to dedicate this evening &apos;s fireworks display
to their legacy .
get in position .
enjoy the show !
stay close to me .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
excuse me .
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
yes . as a matter of fact , i do .
stefan ?
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s happening ?
my head .
what ?
my head .
what &apos;s wrong ?
anna .
please make it stop .
what &apos;s happening ?
what the hell is that ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
that noise .
wait , what noise ?
tyler . tyler !
dude ! hey !
caroline ! the wheel !
tyler !
stefan .
i got this one . there &apos;s one over there .
take this . go . go . go !
i don &apos;t know what happened . he just dropped .
he &apos;s not the only one .
cops are grabbing everyone who &apos;s gone down ,
injecting them with vervain .
what ?
they &apos;re rounding up the vampires .
please help him.he just went down .
wickery
my head ! jeremy .
hey , i got one .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ? hey ! leave her alone !
what are you doing ? hey ! leave her alone !
anna ! leave her alone ! anna !
the device is done .
the only thing keeping them down is the vervain .
we don &apos;t have much time . let &apos;s finish this .
anna .
you can head up . i &apos;ll take it from here .
please . no .
are you ok ?
it &apos;s like needles
were piercing my skull , and then it just stopped .
i saw at least 5 vampires go down .
they were taking them to your family &apos;s old building .
it &apos;s the gilbert device . it has to be .
but how did he get it to work ?
bonnie unspelled it .
maybe she didn &apos;t .
she did . we saw her do it .
no , no , no . he &apos;s right . think about it .
we asked bonnie to deactivate a device
that could protect people against vampires .
so we could protect you .
and damon . vampires .
where is damon ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t seen him since this started .
can you get my brother ? take him home ?
of course .
let &apos;s go .
liz . are you ok ?
there &apos;s a key in ...
what is going on ?
there &apos;s a key in my belt . i need you to get it .
uhh . i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
something &apos;s happened to richard .
they took him .
who took him ?
your deputies . i ... i don &apos;t understand .
he &apos;s not a vampire .
let &apos;s go .
mayor .
is that you ?
what are you doing here ? !
i &apos;m a vampire .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
no , really .
the vervain didn &apos;t affect you .
you &apos;re not a vampire .
what the hell are you ?
mayor lockwood .
hey , are you ok ? your side took the biggest hit .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
no , they need
to check you out .
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
they &apos;re helping tyler .
pulse is steadying .
all right .
what the hell ?
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
his eyes .
what happened ?
dude , don &apos;t scare me like that .
hey , she needs some help over here .
caroline !
guys ! over here .
over there .
caroline , hey . god , what happened ?
caroline , wake up .
wait , wait , wait .
i can hear them .
the building &apos;s on fire .
what ?
building &apos;s on fire .
where &apos;s damon ?
with the rest of them ,
where he should be . it &apos;s over for damon .
you &apos;re crazy .
why ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m doing what should have been done 145 years ago ?
this is the right thing , elena .
go ahead . you won &apos;t make it out .
it &apos;ll save me the trouble of killing you myself .
you know the building well .
is there another entrance in ?
utility door . there &apos;s one around the side .
take one more step , and i &apos;ll alert those deputies
that they missed a vampire .
i &apos;m asking you not to .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
as my father , it should .
you know .
i wasn &apos;t sure .
but now i am .
hey ! you can &apos;t go in there .
the fire will take you out .
he &apos;s my brother , bonnie .
stefan !
elena ! you ... you can &apos;t go in there .
bonnie , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you .
bonnie , i &apos;ve got to get in there .
damon .
come on . hurry up . hurry up .
bonnie ...
bonnie , what is it ? are they gonna be ok ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
the fire &apos;s out .
the story is that the building &apos;s old wiring is what caused it .
did you see where damon went ?
no , he just kind of disappeared .
figures .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re ok .
i try so hard ...
to hate him .
i guess it &apos;s just pointless .
you care about him .
so do i.
but i love you , stefan .
i know that you &apos;re worried about that .
i just ... you know ,
i ... i know my brother .
but i love you , stefan .
i know the trouble he can cause .
i love you , stefan . you .
you have nothing to worry about .
ok ?
so jenna called .
jeremy &apos;s home .
i &apos;m just gonna run over to the school
to pick up my dress , my clothes , the rest of my stuff .
and then i &apos;ll check on him .
what are you doing here ?
anna &apos;s dead .
i figured that once they took her away .
i know you cared about her .
yeah , i did .
i saw her killed .
i was watching and all i could think about was ...
i wanted to help her .
but i couldn &apos;t .
why are you telling me all this ?
i took away your suffering once before .
i can do it again .
but it &apos;s your choice .
look ...
i know you think you took it away ,
but it &apos;s still there .
even if i can &apos;t remember why ,
i still feel empty .
alone .
and making me forget won &apos;t fix it .
it won &apos;t fix what &apos;s really wrong .
what i did to vicki
was wrong .
sorry for my part .
anna said that vampires don &apos;t have to feel pain ;
that they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity .
that &apos;s very true .
is it easier that way ?
is what easier ?
life .
life sucks either way , jeremy .
at least if you &apos;re a vampire ,
you don &apos;t have to feel bad about it if you don &apos;t want to .
is that what you did ?
i did it for ...
i did it for a very long time .
and life was a lot easier .
hey , man .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look , i don &apos;t even know what happened .
it &apos;s ok , man .
she &apos;ll be all right .
what &apos;s happening ? is she all right ?
oh , there was some internal bleeding .
we &apos;re taking her into surgery .
what else did they say ?
is she going to be ok ?
they &apos;re going to do everything they can .
tyler , have you talked to your mom ?
i left her a message telling her i was here .
you need to call her .
what is it ?
it &apos;s your dad .
hey . you , uh ,
you just missed elena .
i was looking for you , actually .
elena is my best friend .
and because she loves you ,
i couldn &apos;t let you or damon die in that fire .
i &apos;m very grateful , bonnie .
i hope you know that .
i do . but i hope you know that things have to change .
damon has to change .
we both want the same thing .
we both want to protect the people we care about .
the difference is , for you ,
damon is one of them .
you saw what i was able to do tonight .
i know who i am now .
and if damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood ,
i &apos;ll take him down .
even if i have to take you with him .
let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t come to that .
let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t .
what are you doing here ?
a failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing .
which was ...
it &apos;s not important . i &apos;ll take this from you .
thank you .
you know , i came in this town wanting to destroy it .
tonight i ...
found myself wanting to protect it .
how does that happen ?
i &apos;m not a hero , elena .
i don &apos;t do good .
it &apos;s not in me .
maybe it is .
no .
no , it &apos;s reserved for my brother ... and you and bonnie ,
even though she has every reason to hate me , still helped stefan save me .
why do you sound so surprised ?
because she did it for you .
which means that somewhere along the way ,
you decided that i was worth saving .
and i wanted to ...
thank you for that .
you &apos;re welcome .
it &apos;s late .
you should probably come inside .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you scared me .
sorry .
you know , i first met isobel when i was a teenager .
i fell in love with her instantly ,
although i &apos;m pretty sure she never loved me .
she was special .
and part of why i hate the vampires so much
is because of what she became .
how it ruined her .
and i never would have sent her to damon
had i known she wanted to turn .
it &apos;s my fault .
i &apos;m telling you this
because i hoped ... maybe you &apos;d understand .
thank you .
can i help ?
sure .
katherine ?
hello , john . good @-@ bye , john .
i looked everywhere .
yeah , someone definitely took my stuff .
i just gotta check on jeremy before i go to the hospital .
can you meet me there ?
ok . i love you , stefan .
jeremy ?
