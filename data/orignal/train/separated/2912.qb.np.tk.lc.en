because i &apos;m not .
we found your tests .
if you &apos;re not pregnant ..
it &apos;s because i am .

yes , i am with child .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything because it &apos;s your day .

so you told people i was pregnant ?
does this look like a conversation i want to remember ?
who &apos;s the father ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t say .

i can &apos;t say because he &apos;s famous .
oh , my god . who is it ?

monica , if you step away , we &apos;ll get chandler and the bridesmaids .
how about just the bridesmaids ?
i am the groom . i was told it was a big deal .

instead you told me monica was pregnant ?
you said she was . i didn &apos;t disagree with you .
sneaky .
smile , ladies !
by the way , james brolin ?
i know .
i could only think of two names : him and ed begley jr .

ed begley jr. is not gay .

ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you :
mr. and mrs. chandler bing .
before we go out there , i got a present .
i &apos;m not gonna put my hand in your pocket .
no . i &apos;ve been taking dancing lessons .
what ?
for the last six weeks . i wanted this to be a moment you &apos;d never forget .
that is so sweet .
so would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife ?
yes .
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s these new shoes , they &apos;re all slippery .
are you gonna be able to do this ?
not well .
well , the good news is , i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s looking at us .
so are you ready to talk about it ?
no .
now ?
no !
we &apos;ll talk about something else then .
thank you .
who &apos;s the father ?
honey , i haven &apos;t told him yet ..
so , until i do , i don &apos;t think i should tell anybody else .
that &apos;s fine . that &apos;s fair .
is it tag ?
phoebe !
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll stop .
is it ross ? it &apos;s ross , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s joey !
stop it . okay ?
i am not gonna tell you until i tell him .
at least we know it &apos;s a him .
oh , sweet lord .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i went down to the gift shop .
it was either this or a bathrobe . what &apos;s more important :
the way i &apos;m dressed , or being with you today ?
honey , i &apos;m not gonna even pretend i was listening . hey ! hey !
i &apos;m ross , i don &apos;t believe we met . i &apos;m monica &apos;s older brother .
hi , i &apos;m mona from her restaurant .
hello , mona from her restaurant .
mona . what a beautiful name .
you think so ? i always kind of hated it .
come on ! mona lisa .
mona ...
llegglachen .
the famous botanist .
oh , no , she &apos;s .. well , she &apos;s dead now , but ..
supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world .
really ?
see , i never knew about her .
linda llegglachen ..
so , what table are you at ?
me too .
good . now there &apos;ll be someone there who likes my name .
yes , there will .
guess what , molly gilbert . you &apos;ve just been bumped up to table one .
and if it &apos;s all right with you , i &apos;ll take your place at table six .
martin llegglachen .
that &apos;s better . now , just bend your arms a little bit . now look straight ahead .
this time i want you to really put your ass into it .
who &apos;s slippery now ?
isn &apos;t that just the best feeling ? rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe ?
chandler , darling , look , my date has finally arrived .
i &apos;d like you to meet dennis phillips . dennis , this is my son , chandler .
congratulations .
thank you .
dennis is a dear old friend ..
and a fantastic lover .
are my ears bleeding ?
don &apos;t mind chandler . he &apos;s always been shy .
oh , you &apos;re right .
bravo , dennis . thanks for pleasing my mother so .
i &apos;m so sorry i missed the ceremony . i was stuck at auditions .
yes , dennis is directing a new broadway show .
i don &apos;t believe we &apos;ve met . joey tribbiani .
dennis phillips .
i &apos;ve admired your work for years .
you &apos;ve done some really amazing stuff .
thank you .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna go get myself a drink .
i &apos;ll be back in a moment .
okay . you stop .
dennis phillips . that &apos;s great . how did you guys meet ?
well , it &apos;s a funny story .
funny , &quot; ha @-@ ha &quot; ? or funny :
thank you . if everyone will please take your seats , dinner will be served .
i thought you were at table six .
no . nine .
see , before , when you showed it to me , you held it that way ..
which was misleading .
hello .
will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips ?
well , they &apos;ve kind of locked themselves in one of the men &apos;s room stalls right now .
perhaps when they get out .
if i could get in a broadway show , then i would &apos;ve done it all .
film , television and theater .
the only thing left would be radio . but that &apos;s just for ugly people .
what size shoes do you wear ?
eleven , 11
my shoes give me a problem on the dance floor . can i borrow your boots ?
i don &apos;t really even know where i left those .
those aren &apos;t 11 .
okay , fine , i &apos;m a 7 !
i have surprisingly small feet . but the rest of me is good . i &apos;ll show you .
who am i kidding ? i belong in radio .
can you believe phoebe got pregnant ?
let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
this is so huge .
sure , but as big as your wedding ?
of course not . nothing is .
between me and you , in this day and age ..
how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant ?
sometimes you can do everything right . everyone wears what they &apos;re supposed to ..
and one of those little guys just gets through .
how ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe they have tools .
well , i talked to her , and she &apos;s definitely gonna have the baby .
she said she &apos;s gonna raise it on her own .
well , maybe that &apos;s really brave .
maybe .
i just hope she realizes how hard it &apos;s gonna be .
maybe she hasn &apos;t really thought it through that much .
well , there &apos;s a lot to think about .
how is she gonna handle this financially ? how is she gonna juggle work ?
does she realize she &apos;s not gonna have a date again for the next , like , 18 years ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m just thinking about phoebe . poor , knocked @-@ up phoebe .
champagne ?
oh , yes ! thank you very much .
that &apos;s actually how the french drink it .
well , i just got off the phone with my lover james brolin .
oh , really ?
apparently , he is married to some singer .
but he said he &apos;d leave her for me . and i said , &quot; james brolin , are you sure ? &quot;
james brolin said ..
rachel &apos;s the one who &apos;s pregnant ?
what ? !
why bother ?
how do you feel ?
i don &apos;t know how i feel .
this is all happening so fast . i have to make all these decisions that i don &apos;t wanna make .
someone just take this away from me !
calm down . maybe you &apos;re not pregnant .
what ? !
when i got pregnant with the triplets , i took that test , like , three times .
yes . maybe it &apos;s a false positive . are you sure you peed on the stick right ?
how many ways are there to do that ?
i &apos;m just saying , don &apos;t freak out until you &apos;re 100 percent sure .
all right , i &apos;ll take it again when i get home .
i can wait until then .
oh , this is such a good party . how late does it go till ?
you gotta take it now .
no , this your wedding .
you &apos;re not gonna be able to have fun until we know . do it as a present to me .
okay , thank you .
i &apos;ll run out and get you one .
you girls are so great .
wait a minute . who &apos;s the father ?
she won &apos;t tell us .
come on ! it &apos;s my wedding . that could be my present !
i just gave you peeing on a stick .
see , this is why you register .
it was the chair again . okay ? i &apos;m not doing it !
dad . can &apos;t you go back to your table ?
no . apparently little molly gilbert is enjoying her grown @-@ up salmon en croute .
look , i don &apos;t .. you know what ?
would you like to dance ?
sure .
great .
dr. geller .
i wasn &apos;t farting !
a little game from our table .
dr. geller , will you dance with me ?
maybe later . right now , i &apos;m about to dance with this lady .
unless this lady wouldn &apos;t mind letting you go first .
i &apos;d be happy to . you are very sweet .
yes , i am .
in fact , let &apos;s try my special way . you can dance on my feet .
sure .
yeah ? hop on .
is the pretty lady looking ? keep dancing .
and the world will never know .
did you talk to dennis about me yet ?
i told him how talented you were and all about days of our lives .
you don &apos;t tell a broadway guy that ! now he thinks i &apos;m just a soap actor .
but you &apos;re not just a soap actor .
you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet .
he has no idea what kind of range i have .
don &apos;t move .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s running on tiny little pegs .
thank you .
no , thank you , miranda .
melinda .
all right .
how cute was that ?
oh , were you watching ?
can i go next ?
of course you can . hop on .
okay , but i get to hop on after her .
i am so gonna score .
what ?
i like your bow .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast to monica and chandler ..
the greatest couple in the world , and my best friends .
when i first found out they were getting married , i was a little angry .
i was like , &quot; why , god ? why ? how can you take them away from me ! &quot;
but then i thought back over all our memories together . some happy memories .
and there were some sad memories .
i &apos;m sorry .
and some scared memories .
and then i realized i &apos;ll always be their friend .
their friend who can speak in many dialects ..
and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity .
to the happy couple .
thank you .
that was very nice , ashley .
can we do it again ?
no , no .
so , is it my turn now ?
i &apos;m next .
that &apos;s okay , you can dance with her first .
are you sure ?
so , what &apos;s your name ?
gert .
that &apos;s pretty .
what are you doing there , gert ?
dancing on your feet like the other girls did it .
okey
hop on , gert .
why aren &apos;t you moving your feet ?
i &apos;m trying .
faster . you &apos;re not going fast enough .
maybe i should stand on your feet !
so did you happen to catch my toast up there ?
oh , my god . that was for my benefit ?
there was a little something for everyone .
i know you &apos;re casting for this new show .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re right for this project .
you &apos;re wrong .
whatever it is , i can do it . if you didn &apos;t see it up there , just try me .
it &apos;s an all chinese cast . can you be chinese ?
well , i &apos;m not proud of this , but ..
oh , my god . please don &apos;t !
ready to get back to the dance floor ?
did it turn into sand ?
come on , i love this song . you &apos;ll be fine .
no . no , i won &apos;t .
do you know why i took all those lessons ?
i didn &apos;t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor ..
with some clumsy idiot .
oh , sweetie , you could never embarrass me .
okay , you could easily embarrass me . but it doesn &apos;t matter , all right ?
i married you .
no matter what you do , i &apos;m gonna come home with you , okay ?
so i &apos;m gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband . come on .
but i &apos;ll tell you , that &apos;s the last time i buy shoes at the slippery fun shoe store .
just try not to move your feet at all .
there you go .
i &apos;m gonna have you arrested .
why ?
you stole my moves !
oh , chandler , you &apos;re quite the dancer !
thanks , mrs. geller .
oh , come on , you can call me mom .
really ?
i will .
sorry , mom .
how much longer ?
30 seconds .
thirty seconds , okay ..

it &apos;s negative .
well , there you go .
that is .. that &apos;s great . that is really great , great news .
you know , because the whole ..
not being ready and , kind of , the financial aspects , all that ..
this is so just the way that this was supposed to be .
then , great .
god , this is so stupid .
how can i be upset over something i never had ?
it &apos;s negative ?
no , it &apos;s positive .
what ?
it &apos;s not negative , it &apos;s positive .
are you sure ?
yeah , i lied before .
now you know how you really feel about it .
that &apos;s a risky little game .

i &apos;m gonna have a baby .
i &apos;m gonna have a baby !
