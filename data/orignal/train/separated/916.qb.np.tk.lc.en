nothing feels more magical than first love .
as a kid , you fall so hard and feel so much ,
it makes the first breakup that much more painful .
it had been months since dana and i split ,
and i decided it was time to move on .
thankfully , my big bro was there to help .
dude , what are you doing ?
feathering my hair like famed lady killer robert lowe .
no . watch and learn .
now that &apos;s what the ladies like .
it looks super wet but somehow it &apos;s dry and crispy .
even though i decided against the flammable helmet head ,
i was starting to feel like i was back on my game .
and what do you know , girls were checking me out .
a lot ! like , too much .
almost as if they weren &apos;t even looking at me --
ah , damn it !
stupid handsome ben .
can you walk somewhere else ?
sure thing , pal .
finding a new dana was gonna be tough ,
so i turned to my sister &apos;s poster gallery
of beloved &apos; 80s heartthrobs for inspiration .
such kind eyes . is that the trick ?
and then reality hit me .
what are you doing to my donnie ? !
these bros get all the girls .
now that dana and i broke up ,
i &apos;ve got to learn their secrets .
well , for starters , they don &apos;t have wonky voices ,
and they don &apos;t cry at &quot; the muppet movie . &quot;
if &quot; rainbow connection &quot; doesn &apos;t move you to tears ,
then you &apos;re not alive .
what happened ?
it -- it &apos;s like i &apos;m totally invisible to girls .
at this rate , i &apos;ll never get another dana .
dude , getting girls is easy .
you don &apos;t know anything about girls .
all you need is a hook --
something that makes you stand out .
yeah ? and what &apos;s your hook ?
turtlenecks .
sexy and comfortable .
still upset about dana , huh ?
lucky for you , i actually know a girl who &apos;s super into you .
really ?
mom , adam &apos;s feeling unloved !
wait , what ?
is my baby sad ?
well , look out , &apos; cause the cuddle coyote is stalking you !
why ?
stay out of my room .
i &apos;m coming for snuggies .
it was march 23 , 1980 @-@ something
and barry was planning for his future
by watching the ambassador of the wealthy -- robin leach .
robin leach was about to explain why i need a wine butler .
too bad . you &apos;re supposed to be studying for the psat !
and i finished .
i did every practice exam in the whole book .
oh , is that right ? explain this .
the correct answers just happened to form
the van halen logo .
and a dog ?
a peace sign .
pac @-@ man .
i love that game .
and some hideous googly @-@ eyed monster .
well , that &apos;s actually you .
well , i &apos;m putting this on the fridge ,
but i &apos;m still enraged .
let &apos;s just nip this conversation in the butt .
tests just aren &apos;t for me .
when it came to college , my dad did what he never did --
get involved .
moron !
you &apos;re gonna throw your whole life away like a moron , moron ?
wait !
did you just actually abandon your chair
and tv to get involved ?
look , you &apos;re gonna prepare for that test .
your whole damn future depends on it .
don &apos;t worry about my future .
trust me , i have a million awesome options .
i don &apos;t want to hear your options .
nba superstar power forward ,
professional ninja , successful eskimo ,
a.k.a. success @-@ kimo ,
and as a fallback , billionaire entrepreneur .
spell &quot; entrepreneur . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; -- - get in the car !
hey , this isn &apos;t the zoo .
you &apos;re taking a psat prep course .
out !
hello , and what educational stretches
are we looking to strengthen today ?
actually , i won &apos;t waste your time .
i &apos;ll just wait here and make small talk
until my dad circles around the block
to make sure i didn &apos;t bail .
after that , i &apos;m out .
are you sure that --
he &apos;s taking a lap to check in on me ,
a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ and ...
suck it .
as barry was ditching the class ,
i was facing the sad reality
that i &apos;d never find a girl like dana .
poor kid .
h @-@ he &apos;s been a wreck since he broke up with dana .
i know . it breaks my heart to see him like this .
past two years , all he &apos;s cared about is a girl .
but now i &apos;ve got my snuggle muffin back .
yeah , you really sound torn up about it .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;ll be nice
to finally spend some time with him again .
&apos;cause the fact is ,
nothing heals a broken heart faster than mom time .
did you say faster or weirder ?
ooh ! it &apos;s on . it &apos;s on .
kiddo , come watch with us !
this is history in the making .
david copperfield is gonna walk
through the great wall of china .
long before david blaine ,
we had the original rock star magician ,
david copperfield .
his mind @-@ blowing tricks were truly event tv .
levitating over the grand canyon is one thing ,
but this is just plain crazy .
there is no magic in this world . love is dead .
but i &apos;ll watch &apos; cause i &apos;m so alone .
oh , no , he &apos;s flatlining !
go back , david !
it &apos;s not worth it !
oh , mr. and mrs. copperfield must be beside themselves !
you do know that walking through a solid wall
of ancient chinese rocks is humanly --
oh , balls !
oh , you gave us quite a scare , you handsome bastard .
so handsome .
in that moment , i was put under the spell .
miss heather thomas .
it wasn &apos;t just the trick that impressed me .
it was that copperfield oozed cool .
magic was the ultimate hook ,
and with it , the ladies would fall under my spell .
what the hell is this , dude ?
isn &apos;t it awesome ? magic &apos;s my big hook !
was juggling already taken , nerd ?
trust me , there &apos;s one thing i know about women --
they love magic .
watch and learn .
yo , lisa ! you like flowers ?
yeah .
wrong button .
give me a sec .
why won &apos;t you stiffen ?
stiffen , damn it !
wow , good trick .
you made the girl completely disappear .
um ... are you the kid from the paper ?
i -- oh , wow , yes . me him paper .
well , my mom wants to hire you
for my little brother &apos;s birthday party .
um , you any good ?
good ?
we &apos;re talking illusion , sleight of hand ,
real jedi mind @-@ trick stuff .
then this is the party you &apos;re looking for .
you understood my &quot; star wars &quot; reference ?
party &apos;s on saturday .
and you should probably get a new picture for your ad .
you &apos;re a lot cuter in person .
it was a miracle !
or was it magic ?
see that ?
all thanks to magic , i just found my new dana .
do you think it &apos;ll be a problem
you don &apos;t actually know magic ?
oh , 100 % .
but i was going to learn ,
which was something barry was still resisting .
dudes , where you been ?
i &apos;ve been waiting a freakin &apos; hour !
why are you sitting in that thing ?
&apos;cause i stole it from the food mart
so we could take turns smashing it into the dumpsters .
sorry , bro . psat study group ran late .
psat study group ? for what ?
um , to , like , get into college and get jobs and stuff .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re madman schwartz .
you &apos;re gonna be a successful wwf villain hated by millions .
naturally , but as a fallback ,
i &apos;ll probably be an ophthalmologist like my dad ,
eyeman schwartz .
what ? !
cogan , talk some sense into this lunatic .
actually , i &apos;m the one that gave him the idea .
i &apos;m thinking about doing premed .
that &apos;s not the dream .
you &apos;re gonna be a female body inspector .
turns out , that &apos;s not a real job ,
just a hilarious t @-@ shirt .
okay , naked rob , my rock .
please tell me you &apos;re still gonna be
a steel drummer on a clothing @-@ optional beach .
well , i was thinking about getting my degree in musical engineering .
it &apos;ll require clothes , but at some point ,
a boy &apos;s got to become a man .
what the hell happened to all our plans ?
you &apos;re making me feel like all this time in the parking lot
smashing stuff was a complete waste of time !
bar , all our plans were just big dreams .
college is real life .
real life is for sellouts .
i will never give up my dreams .
my dreams are what give me my dignity .
dignity , i say !
good day to you , gentlemen !
as barry was pushing himself towards a dim future ,
i was entering a magical world ...
with my mom .
i don &apos;t know , squishy .
all these fancy tricks , they &apos;re just so pricy .
can &apos;t i just get you something like this ?
i think these are aces .
come on . i need copperfield @-@ level stuff .
i get the appeal of davey c.
i do .
but this is too much .
it was clear if i wanted her to fund my act ,
i &apos;d have to do some acting of my own .
i just figured magic could be fun ...
for both of us .
what exactly are you saying ?
you know , something we could share together .
i mean , there &apos;s no dana .
might as well hang out with my next best lady .
okay , don &apos;t with me here .
are you talking about mom time ?
yeah , sure .
say it .
whatever .
say the words . say &quot; mom time . &quot;
do we have to call it that ?
yeah .
mom time .
so , can i get the good tricks ?
well , i guess every good magician
needs a beautiful assistant they can saw in half .
or a hands @-@ off producer who waits in the wings .
this is gonna be so much fun !
you can be the amazing adam , and i &apos;ll be the amazing beverly !
we can &apos;t both be amazing .
hey ! does somebody work here ?
we need all your best tricks for mom time !
oh . okay .
also , uh , somebody set the birds free .
oh , boy .
after getting the best tricks in the shop ,
i picked up magic really quick .
unfortunately , i also picked up
a focus @-@ stealing smother sidekick .
the amazing schmoopie , everybody .
no wires .
oh ! honey .
gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme .
just an ordinary bottle of ketchup
that i bought at the supermarket and not at the magic shop .
and for my next trick ,
i &apos;m gonna make a plate of cookies appear from scratch .
well , uh , what do you think ?
your act is ... actually decent .
yes !
and every second of it is ruined by your mom .
hey , mama , can we talk ?
we illusionists don &apos;t need to talk .
we just use esp .
you know , extra @-@ schmoopery @-@ perception .
good stuff .
you can &apos;t be my assistant for the party .
say what now ?
turns out doing a magic act with your mother is super weird .
well , it &apos;s no weirder than if we were tennis partners
or joined a dance competition together .
truth is , the reason why i did this is to impress a girl .
but you just broke up with a girl .
what about mom time ?
honestly , i kind of played that part of it up
so you &apos;d buy me fancy tricks .
i guess all we can do now is move on .
yeah , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m returning all your fancy tricks .
what ? no ! i looked at store policy .
once the magic is unleashed , there &apos;s no returns .
you think a return policy has ever stopped me ?
then go and return the magic .
i &apos;ll come up with my own
david copperfield grand illusion !
fine ! well , enjoy your mom time ...
without your mom .
yep , my mom didn &apos;t take being left behind well .
and neither did barry .
it &apos;s crazy .
i mean , my entire posse
is suddenly all about going to college ?
what &apos;s wrong with them ?
chill .
they &apos;re just studying a few vocab words .
i &apos;m sure your best friends will still end up nobody losers .
that &apos;s very nice of you to say , but they seem real serious .
has it ever occurred to you
that perhaps you should get serious , too ?
barry &apos;s right .
who says we have to , like , plan out our entire lives ?
we &apos;re just kids , man .
exactly .
the future &apos;s now .
can &apos;t just let some stupid test define who we are .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t even open up my test results
and see how i did .
that &apos;s how little i care .
wait . you took the sat ?
but you always said that test was a joke .
oh , it is . but you got to take it .
give me that !
oh , no ! 1,280 ? !
lainey , that &apos;s unreal !
i did it !
why is this happening to me ?
oh , sweetie , i swear this doesn &apos;t change anything .
so you &apos;re still gonna be a background dancer on &quot; club mtv &quot; ?
oh , hell no .
you beginning your bright future is a complete betrayal ,
but you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause i &apos;m still gonna be a rapping
basketball ninja rapping entrepreneur .
and i totally believe in you , sweetie .
but yeah , maybe you should study for the test .
traitor ! you beautiful , smart traitor !
while barry couldn &apos;t believe lainey &apos;s betrayal ,
i was ready to believe in the impossible .
hey , kiddo , how &apos;s the magic treating you ?
ah , pops , good . we have so much to discuss .
i pored over every magic special made by master copperfield ,
as he is the standard against which
all us magicians judge ourselves .
uh @-@ huh . maybe we should turn the light on .
after staying up all night ,
i finally figured out how he does it , all of it --
flying over canyons , making lady liberty vanish ,
walking through walls .
ooh , this sounds juicy .
what is it ? what &apos;s the secret ?
magic .
no , yeah , i get it .
a real magician can &apos;t reveal his tricks ,
but how does he do it ?
that &apos;s just it .
real actual magic .
yeah , i &apos;m not following you .
there &apos;s no way a human being could actually accomplish
what this man could do .
unless it &apos;s real .
still not following you .
follow this !
magic is real .
you should probably get some sleep .
no time !
i &apos;ve realized the key to legitimate sorcery
is to believe .
if you truly have the magic in your heart ,
you can walk through any wall .
i don &apos;t think you can .
i shall traverse through solid matter
and appear on the other side of this wall .
behold !
oh , my god !
oh , no !
magic isn &apos;t real !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell ya !
you &apos;re right . i can bounce back .
i just have to put together a new magic act
that &apos;ll entertain a bunch of kids .
easy .
peasy .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
you &apos;ll pull it off for sure .
you can &apos;t let him go through with this .
he &apos;ll make a fool of himself in front of new dana .
well , he should &apos;ve thought of that before he lied to me
about mom time and broke my heart .
the kid is boned , bevy .
he &apos;s literally walking into walls .
ow ! damn it !
how does the gorgeous warlock do it ? !
while my mom was realizing the effects of destroying my show ,
barry was about to put on a show of his own .
greetings , and thank you for coming .
you may have wondered why i gathered you all here today .
yes , i was wondering .
see , i was sitting here watching &quot; macgyver , &quot;
and you assembled these morons around me .
first i &apos;d like you all to know that you &apos;re all the dearest
and most important people in my life .
and everything about you disgusts me
&apos;cause you &apos;re all human garbage .
appreciate the honesty . can we go ?
no .
you may have given up your dreams
to become cogs in the machine .
but not me .
we discussed this .
you &apos;re studying and going to a good school .
look , i speak for all of the jtp ...
jtp .
... when i say that being a freelance ninja for hire
is a big reach .
i mean , you could study with us if you want .
never !
forget ninja .
i &apos;m getting real here .
talking about my most sensible dream .
billionaire entrepreneur !
you do realize that entrepreneurs
have actual business ideas and billionaires have billions ?
oh , i do and i will ,
as soon as i present the world
with any one of these awesome entrepreneurical ideas .
first up -- the reverse microwave .
makes things colder !
so , a refrigerator ?
next !
know about fingerless gloves ?
how about just fingers ?
i call it just fingers .
did you cut up my isotoners ?
next , the front pack .
that &apos;s just a backpack you &apos;re wearing wrong .
next !
a house for birds .
um , that kind of already exists .
not like this . mine &apos;s for the upscale bird .
okay , i &apos;m shutting it down .
everyone go home .
you know what else got shut down ?
sir isaac newton when he invented the apple .
that &apos;s enough !
you &apos;re studying for that test . end of story .
no ! i &apos;m not even gonna take the stupid psat
or the real one .
honey , we discussed this . everyone takes that test .
what &apos;s the point ?
we all know i &apos;m gonna blow it like i always do .
barry , you &apos;re not gonna --
no , i am !
all i have are dreams &apos; cause i suck at real life ,
and i &apos;m supposed to sit here and watch you leave me behind ?
have fun with your awesome dreams without me in them .
it was the morning of my big show ,
and i was hoping my grand illusion
would impress my new dana .
oh , there you are . perfect timing .
yep . so happy i didn &apos;t cancel at the last minute .
u @-@ unless you want me to .
you &apos;re funny .
and even though the amazing beverly
had taken away my best tricks ,
the amazing adam still had one more up his sleeve .
it &apos;s showtime .
oh , thanks .
welcome , joshua feldstein and friends .
i &apos;m the amazing adam .
witness the impossible as i levitate .
yes .
crap !
that is normal .
it &apos;s a part of the trick .
i mean , magic .
i just need to re @-@ levitate my foot .
magic !
my act was a complete bust ...
... but then something truly magical happened .
and that , ladies and gentlemen ,
is what we call classic misdirection !
and now , time for the real show .
mom ! you got my good tricks back .
no time to talk . knock &apos; em dead , love bug .
hey , ma .
you know , a real magician always needs an assistant .
are you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
that &apos;s the thing about our parents .
at the end of the day , they &apos;re at your side ...
he cut me in half , but i love him twice as much .
... whether you can admit you need them or not .
your dopey friends said i &apos;d find you here .
just gonna sit like this all day ?
more like the rest of my stupid life .
everyone &apos;s moving on . everybody but me .
look --
i know i said that the only thing i care about is college ,
but what i really care about is whether or not you &apos;re happy .
it &apos;s gonna be hard to be happy
when i &apos;m stuck in this town &apos; cause i blew the test .
that &apos;s not true , barry .
if you ask me , the way your brain works ,
it &apos;s like no one else &apos;s .
stop .
i &apos;m serious !
i &apos;ve never met anyone who thinks the way you do .
i did come up with just fingers .
trust me , i think you &apos;re gonna surprise everybody ,
and mostly yourself if you &apos;ll just try !
thanks , dad .
let &apos;s go home .
and even when you &apos;re at your lowest ,
they push you to be more than you could ever dream of .
check it out . front pack .
not bad , right ?
you look injured .
my spine hurts a little .
i know i kind of freaked out .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t want this to end .
good . &apos; cause no matter where i end up ,
we &apos;ll always be together .
yo , tasty ! study group starts in five .
study group ? i &apos;m impressed .
what can i say ? i &apos;m a torkulent guy .
that &apos;s not a word , sweetie .

yeah . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not .
i really miss dana .
i know .
we were so good together .
how will i ever find that again ?
trust me .
you will .
what makes you so sure ?
if there &apos;s one thing the amazing adam &apos;s taught me ,
there &apos;s plenty of magic in the world .
when you &apos;re growing up ,
you can &apos;t always avoid heartache .
here , let me help you with that .
but if you &apos;re lucky ,
a little mom time can help you through it .
and that &apos;s pure magic .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t resist .
now , here &apos;s our magic magician !
gregarious .
sociable .
sociable .
friendly .
wow , are you still studying ?

my brain will sponge up all the information ,

i guess i &apos;m just a character .
