第六季 第二十二集[本季终]
No. I actually...
No, it's not a good idea.
Medical marijuana?
Yes. Why are you laughing?
It's legal now.
Because, Jacob, there is a fine line
between legal and illegal in this business.
Why don't you just start a nursery?
I have a business partner
who thinks that this is the better way to go.
Let me study up on the regulations,
and I'll call you back. Jacob, go slow on this.
Daddy!
Okay, thanks.
All done.
Wow. Catering.
This must be serious.
Just, uh, trying to be respectful of your time.
So, what's new?
I've been asked to run for president.
Not the response I expected, but okay.
By whom?
The Illinois Democratic Committee.
Why?
Are you kidding?
No. I mean, the race is
already happening, isn't it? You're late.
Not to announce. I'm not running to win.
I'm running to be vice president.
The party analyzed the race and decided that the current
frontrunners wouldn't accept each other as vice president,
so that meant there's room for an outsider.
What do you think?
Oh, sorry. I have to get that.
Hello.
滑动拨号
Yikes.

Yeah, can I help you?
Let go of the window.
Get your hands off me, man. No, take your hands off!
You want a bullet in your head?
Let go of the window!
No, no! Wait a minute...
He's got his cell phone on.
I don't have any cash!
And it's recording. Check his pocket.
Alicia! Alicia, help me, help...
Hi. This is Jacob Rickter.
Please leave a message at the beep.
Alicia, we have to head out.
Sorry. A client.
Okay, listen,
I'm not running
unless you and the kids agree to it.
Peter, I reacted too fast.
Congratulations. I know this is what you've always wanted.
It is pretty amazing. Thank you.
Hello.
Nicole, hi. I'm Jacob's lawyer.
I was just talking to Jacob. Is he still there?
No, he went out to meet with Greg.
Want me to have him call?
Oh, uh, is Greg his partner?
Yes. Why?
Do you know where they were meeting?
No, I don't. What's wrong, Alicia?
Nothing. It's probably nothing,
but I need to get a hold of Jacob.
Can you try Greg for me?
Sure. Hold on.
Mrs. Florrick. Hi.
It's me.
Mr. Lester?
I thought I'd just drop by.
My wife says I'm not spontaneous enough, so...
Actually, Mr. Lester, I'm a bit busy.
Yes, me, too.
May I come in?
Actually, I'm in the midst, Mr. Lester.
Do you need the phone number for Mr. Bishop's new lawyers?
You know Mr. Bishop's in jail awaiting trial?
Yes, I did. But again, I'm not his...
Can I have a glass of water?
It's just so hot outside.
Sure.
So, um, how is your friend, uh, Kalinda?
How? I don't know.
Mr. Bishop is very interested in her whereabouts.
Do you happen to have any idea where that might be?
No.
Oh, you didn't need to bring me the whole bottle.
I always think these things are such a waste,
just ending up in a landfill somewhere.
I recycle.
So, Kalinda's gone from her apartment, her cell phone's off.
No one seems to know where she is.
And yet in court two days ago,
you said Kalinda talked to you about your case.
So that makes you the last person to talk to her.
So, did she happen to leave you anything, Alicia?
A note or anything?
No.
Really?
A good friend like you?
It would make things so much
less complicated for you if you helped me.
For you and your family.
Do you know who was just here, Mr. Lester?
Kalinda?
No.
My husband, the governor.
Maybe you've heard of him.
He was here with his two bodyguards.
Two more downstairs and two in his SUV.
You may have seen them when you arrived?
They gave me a panic button in the kitchen,
and when I went to get your water, I pushed it.
So if I were you, I would take
your little bottle of water and go.
And tell Mr. Bishop I no longer work for him.
Okay, I got hold of Greg.
Oh, Nicole, hold on one second.
I need to take this, Mr. Lester.
If you could take five steps back so I can close the door.
Next time you talk to Kalinda, tell her I need to speak to her.
Good-bye, Mr. Lester.
Sorry, Nicole. What did he say?
Well, he said that Jacob never showed up.
What's going on? What did you hear?
I-I don't know,
but it sounded like Jacob had turned on his phone
so I could hear him being accosted by... two men.
What two men?
I don't know. Look, it might not be anything.
He had money, Alicia, uh, for his business.
Let me call the police.
Why did he call you?
What?
Why you, Alicia? Why not me?
Nicole, hold on for a second.
What? Wait.
What are you doing?
I have an idea.
There's a chance he called me because he was being arrested.
I think what I heard was an arrest.
Okay, call me back, Alicia.
I will. Don't worry.
29th District Booking. How may I direct your call?
Yes. This is Alicia Florrick.
My client was arrested a half hour ago,
and I need you to check the arrest queue for his CB number.
Client's name?
Jacob Rickter.
Hold, please.
Cary, hi. Do you have a minute?
Yeah. Wait. Hold on, Alicia.
Completely ridiculous. You're being so obtuse...
What is it?
Do you have any way of getting in touch with Kalinda?
No. Why?
Charles Lester was here.
When?
A minute ago.
Are you all right?
Yes.
What did he want?
He wanted to talk to Kalinda, find out where she was.
Cary, do you have an opinion on this?
It's not about
opinions, Diane.
Of course it's about opinions.
It's about opinions, it's about beliefs.
No, no.
It's the smart move.
You're always talking about smart...
What?
David?
David, what?
Simone?
Yes.
You're the new paralegal?
Yes. Oh, did you need anything?
Oh, sure.
Did you know Louis Canning's wife works here?
What?
What?
He still hasn't called.
And Central Booking says he wasn't arrested.
Oh, my God. Alicia...
Do you have your cell phone?
Did Jacob set this up?
Yes. Why?
There's this app on both your iPhones if he set it up. Good.
Find a phone.
What's that?
It's the last location of Jacob's phone.
南霍曼大道
My client is here. Jacob Rickter.
May I see him, please?
Right, he was just signed in two hours ago. Hold on.
Hello, ma'am.
I was wrong. He's not here.
Uh... I'm sorry. What?
The man you asked about--
he's not here.
But you just said he was.
Yeah. Yes, uh, I made a mistake.
You... May I look at your database?
No. He's not here.
How-how can you make that kind of mistake?
I mean, he's either here or he's not.
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
It's against the law
to hold him without access to his lawyer,
and I'm his lawyer.
Mike, I need your help out here!
Please, ma'am.
What? My client has a constitutional guarantee...
Do you have an automobile near here, ma'am?
You can let go. I'm fine.
Okay, we're gonna need you to drive away, ma'am.
Or what?
Or you'll be interfering in police matters.
You have a nice day, ma'am.
Yeah, it's Homan Square.
Excuse me?
Homan Square. It houses the bomb squad and the undercover cops
and... the police sometimes hold suspects there, too.
Yeah, but they can't... they... they wouldn't
let me in to see my client.
Yeah, but your client's not under arrest yet.
So the police have taken him, but he wasn't arrested?
Yup.
Because if he was arrested, I would be allowed to see him?
Right.
Oh, my God, this is insane.
You need to file a habeas petition right away.
The police mostly take people to Homan Square
that nobody cares about, so you start caring...
they'll release him.
Got it. Wow.
Oh, Alicia. I've thought about it.
What?
You and me.
Uh, starting a firm.
Oh, right.
We-We should do it.
Oh, my God.
Sorry. I thought you were gonna say no. And I...
Wow, I've been apologizing a lot lately. I need to stop doing that.
That... This is great news. Partner.
Okay. So, we're off.
Right.
Our first client. Jacob Rickter.
Jacob Rickter.
We have a habeas matter, I believe,
but we also have the matter of lunch.
The people are willing to delay until after lunch, Your Honor.
Unfortunately, this is time-sensitive, Your Honor.
We have a client being held by police
and we need access to him.
He's not being held.
Okay, okay. Can this be argued in less than five minutes?
Yes, Your Honor.
No, Your Honor.
Well, let's live dangerously and try.
Take your hands off!
You want a bullet in your head?
Let go of the window!
No, no! Wait a minute...
He's got his cell phone on.
I don't have any cash!
And it's recording. Check his pocket.
Alicia! Alicia, help me, help me, plea...
That's an arrest, Your Honor.
I don't know what that it is, but there is no foundation
for any part of that.
Mr. Brody,
it's a simple matter, as habeas petitions go.
Why can't you produce Mr. Rickter?
Very simply, Your Honor, we don't have him.
As was explained to Mrs. Florrick on numerous occasions,
her client is not in the CB database.
We have not arrested him.
He's being held in Homan Square.
Do you know that for a fact, Counselor?
We have his wife's cell phone showing us that his cell is there.
No, it was just turned off there.
It's not determinative.
Anyway, when I hear that call,
it doesn't sound like the police.
It sounds like a person being accosted.
He's right, Counselors. Call the police
or bring me stronger evidence of an arrest.
Otherwise, I don't know what to do. Lunch.
I'm Diane Lockhart.
Yes. I know.
Uh, do you need something?
No, no.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
You're Simone...
Raushenbush.
Ah, that's your maiden name?
Yes.
Is that a problem?
No.
I just think we know your husband.
Yes, you do. Louis Canning.
I used my maiden name in the interview
because I wanted to get this job on my own.
Is that all right?
Yes.
Uh, just to be clear,
we're often in competition with your husband.
Oh, I know. I am completely discreet.
Completely. You can totally trust me.
Nice to meet you.
You as well.
Lockhart, Agos & Lee. Please hold.
Ms. Lockhart.
Hello, how are you?
Mr. Lester.
You know, it seems that every time
I come up here, this place has a new name.
Well, we like to keep you on your toes.
In fact, it's, uh,
actually Mr. Bishop's intention
to only pursue legitimate work from now on.
Cary, hello.
Mr. Lester.
Lemond Bishop
is thinking of bringing his business back here.
Really? I thought he was in jail.
He is, yes. Uh,
thus the disappointment
in his current representation.
So, uh, where's that great little investigator
you have around here?
Kalinda doesn't work here anymore.
Where does she work?
We don't know. She left.
Well, let me, uh,
leave you my number.
Certainly.
Oh, and if, uh, Kalinda gets in touch with you,
you can reach me at this number,
day or night. Talk to you soon.
He's after Kalinda?
Yes.

What's going on? Are we in trouble?
Are we moving?
No, your mom and I just wanted
to run something by you.
It's not over yet,
Nicole. We have a sympathetic judge
and we have new evidence.
I have to go. Uh, I'll talk to you.
Sorry. Court ran late.
Did you, uh, have the talk already?
No, we just started.
Started what?
Okay, so...
the Democratic Committee...
Sorry.
The Democratic Committee has asked me to run for president.
You're kidding.
That's great. When?
Uh, well, I'd have to start making trips to Iowa next week.
The White House, wow. I'll be one Metro stop away.
Actually, it's not to win.
The logic is, I would run to make myself
a viable candidate for vice president.
Cool. That's still cool.
Grace?
Well, would you run together?
What do you mean?
You and Mom--
would you go to Iowa together?
Well, I don't know if I'll have the time.
Well, maybe... maybe a few times, hopefully.
Look, nothing's been decided.
I'm not gonna run unless we all agree.
This is going to be a family consensus.
Are you still gonna pretend you're married?
We don't have to pretend-- we are married.
You're living in your apartment, Dad.
And Mom's here.
Well, that's because I have to be in Springfield.
Yes. We'd still have to pretend.
Peter.
Close the door, okay?
Are we gonna be angry with each other?
No.
Peter...
you already decided.
Don't put it on us.
Put what? I haven't decided.
Look...
Grace will approve your decision
because she knows you want to run,
and she doesn't want to stand in your way.
And then they'll rip us to shreds,
because that's what the press does.
They'll look into our lives,
our families, our children,
and Grace will blame herself.
It's not her decision.
You know it's not her decision.
It's yours and Eli's.
You don't think I can walk away from this?
I don't think you can walk away from this.
Then you don't know me.
Okay.
I don't approve.
If it's up to your family,
I don't want you to run for president.
Okay.
Officer, hello.
You know Jacob Rickter is in that building, sir.
Why don't you just leave me alone, please?
His family is going crazy.
They're worried he's dead or kidnapped.
I don't think you realize how bad this is.
Jacob Rickter is epileptic.
He's been 12 hours without his medication.
In another four hours he could be dead.
You're lying.
And if he dies,
Officer Tannerman, everybody in that building
has deniability except you.
You're the only one I've told.
And I will sue you for everything you have.
You're lying.
You have any doubts, call his doctor.
Go ahead, call him.
He'll tell you.
How long do you think we should give it?
Another hour.
Alicia, can I be up front with you?
Have you not been?
No, I have been, but, um...
this girl that I'm seeing is my ex-wife.
We're making another go at it.
That's great. Good.
Yeah, it is great. It is great.
I don't like failing at things.
And I-I feel like I failed at it, so...
No, it's fantastic.
So it's not gonna get in the way of us working together?
What? No, no. No.
Good.
Because I want it to work.
Hello.
You want to talk to me about my patient, Jacob Rickter?
Oh, nothing yet, sir. But I'm just getting started.
Nah, only if I need help.
Do you know how many frozen pizza choices there are?
It's like a nightmare of pizzas.
Yes, uh... yes, sir.
I'll call you, uh, when they make the next move.
Thanks.
You looking for me?
Hello, Kalinda.
I was wondering when you'd contact me.
Well, you can stop wondering.
One more thing off the list.
So...
maybe you can help me with a problem I'm having.
Oh, I was just thinking about recording.
An old lawyer's habit.
So... what's the problem?
Problem?
Do you know a good frozen pizza?
No.
My wife says Pizza in the Wall.
Now, I've never tried it.
Listen to me, Mr. Lester,
I'm limited for time, so, um...
Do you have a question?
Yes.
Did you betray Mr. Bishop?
No.
And yet you ran.
I didn't run.
You moved out of your apartment.
You canceled your cell plan.
In Mr. Bishop's line of work,
those are very suspicious acts.
I read the writing on the wall.
Really? What writing was that?
Dexter was blaming me
for Bishop's arrest.
Well, I will admit,
my suspicions fall between him and you.
But Dexter has the advantage because he's actually here,
talking to Mr. Bishop.
You're not.
Hey! Pizza in the wall it is.
I'll make a deal with you, Mr. Lester.
You leave my work and my friends alone,
and I will come and see Mr. Bishop.
And who do we define as your friends?
You know who.
Look, I will make my case to Mr. Bishop,
but you need to butt out of my life.
When could you meet with him?
Wednesday. 8:00.
In the visiting room.
Earlier would be better.
Wait, what about my phone?
Buy a new one.
All rise!
What's going on, Matan?
Have you got him or not?
This is all news to me, Your Honor.
I don't approve of Mrs. Florrick
and Mr. Polmar's little ploy.
It does seem the police were tricked
into calling this nonexistent doctor.
However, they admitted to having their client.
Yes, and I contacted the officers at Homan Square,
but they insist, at the time of the habeas hearing yesterday,
they did not have Mr. Rickter.
That is B.S., Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick, you're winning here.
Be gracious.
This is my ruling. I want the police
to open the Homan Square doors to Mr. Rickter's lawyers now.
Good. Our first win.
Well, don't count your chickens.
Mrs. Florrick. Oh.
Mr. Kingsley-Weaver. Did we have a meeting today?
Um, Finn, this is my ghostwriter.
Oh, really? Wow. That's, um...
impressive.
I just heard you were in court this afternoon,
and I thought it might help
with the writing of the memoir.
Oh, actually, today I'm just a bit busy.
Perfect. I'll just stay out of your way.
Look, we have to fire her!
We don't know if Canning put her here as a spy.
Come on. She's not a spy.
I talked to her. She used her maiden name.
Oh, because she's worried about nepotism?
Seriously?
Yes.
And she's doing good work.
Look, she goes home to Canning and talks, pillow talk.
She promised not to share confidential information.
And she might not even know she's sharing it.
I know Canning.
He'll use anything.
I agree. We have to let her go.
We just had a cyber-attack
on our e-mail system that almost destroyed us.
Can't keep dropping our guard.
Good.
I'll fire her.
No.
Two name partners against one, Diane.
No, I'll do it.
I don't...
We're just economizing.
Y... I'm... Please don't fire...
I can do more.
You know, I can work harder.
It's not that.
You were doing great, and we'll give you a good reference.
There are no other jobs out there.
Well, maybe with your husband.
I did this on my own.
This was me.
I know.
I'm so very sorry.
I have a court order for you...
I have a court order for you to allow me to see my client.
Yes, we received word from the court.
And good news, Mrs. Florrick,
he's already meeting with his lawyer.
Excuse me?
Mr. Rickter is already meeting with his lawyer.
I'm his lawyer.
Not according to Mr. Rickter.
He's already talking with his lawyer.
I want to see him now.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Florrick,
but he is in a meeting with his lawyer.
I know you're desperate for his business.
The judge is gonna crucify you.
Have a nice day.
Meet me in court.
They're screwing with us.
Okay.
Notice how calm I am.
Let me speak this clearly and simply, Mr. Brody.
I want Mr. Rickter here, in my court, today.
If he is not here in the next two hours,
I will hold you personally in contempt.
And I will begin assigning fines.
Are my words clear?
They are, Your Honor.
He will be here in two hours.
So this is a standard case for your new firm?
Well, he's only my second client,
so it's too early to tell.
Why are you doing this?
Is it about injustice?
He needed help.
It's like a puzzle.
How do you get the law to help someone?
But...
you care?
You care?
Do I care? Yes. Um...
What-what is that, a rough draft?
Yes. I like to give my notes some shape.
But it's not really a narrative yet.
May I see it?
Actually, let me get it in better shape.
Whose notes are those?
Oh, just... feedback.
Feedback from whom?
Eli?
I'm not really supposed to say anything.
It's my memoir, right?
I'll be right back.
You rang, Madam First Lady?
Sit down, Eli.
I would, but I-I don't like sitting on steps.
I always think dogs urinate there.
Whose idea was the memoir?
Whose idea? Mine.
And what was the point?
To introduce you to the public.
To rehabilitate me.
I wouldn't put it that way.
But sure, it's a good way to put
the state's attorney's race behind you.
"Too much ball busting.
Softer words needed.
Why the emphasis on work versus home?"
Where'd you get that?
"Rethink." Are these your edits?
Yes.
So, you're remaking me as...
a homemaker?
No.
But the ghostwriter wanted to drive it towards
courtroom and action, and I just wanted it...
a bit more balanced.
So, you want me to play the wife...
with the cookie recipes?
Alicia, no.
"Ask A. for possible recipes here."
Okay, that was a bad idea.
Don't patronize me, Eli.
I read your notes.
It's a good story.
It's a story with a lesson.
But it's not true.
What's "true"?!
Okay.
No to this.
No to being First Lady. No to everything.
Jacob, thank God. Are you okay?
I'm good.
But I should've taken your advice.
With?
About the business.
Going slow.
Why? What's wrong?
Mr. Rickter, finally!
There was a Godot-like quality to our experiences...
Your Honor, if I may interject?
Mr. Rickter has confessed
to an intent to acquire 25 marijuana plants.
What?!
A class-three felony
with a minimum sentence of two to five years.
He had no representation. We had no access to him.
He did not ask for a lawyer,
so no lawyer was provided.
He was held in Homan Square...
Yes. But now we're addressing
a different matter, Counselors.
I imagine you would move to throw out this confession.
Yes, Your Honor, definitely.
I will hear arguments on this tomorrow.
Mr. Rickter, you will stay in our custody until then.
Have a good evening.
He never asked for an attorney.
Yes, but did they Mirandize him?
Because the confession is illegal
if they never read him his Miranda rights.
Well, they'll just argue that he was never under arrest.
So we'll refute that.
Put Jacob on the stand?
Right. Good!
Okay, good.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Have a good night.
I thought you were gone.
I was.
Charles Lester is asking about you.
I don't think it's safe here.
It is for five minutes.
Tequila.
You sure?
Yeah.
For the road.
I left you a note, Alicia.
You didn't give it to Lester?
I didn't want to.
It's a confession.
I left it in case anyone came after me.
It gets you off the hook, Alicia.
You need to give him the note.
I'm serious, Alicia.
You need to give him the note.
A great thing happened when I lost the election.
I gave up.
Anger, jealousy... what people thought--
I just threw them overboard.
It's nice not to care.
It made me miss just sitting in a bar...
drinking...
with you.
One more?
Alicia, I, uh...
I don't really...
I'm not very good at talking.
I never have been, but...
I do need to say this.
My time with you
as your friend was,
was the best I ever had.
And... I'm sorry.
And I'm...
I'm really sorry that things got messed up.
I wish we had the chance to... do it over again.
I have to go.
I'll never see you again?
I don't think so.
That's too bad.
I, um...
Good-bye.
Damn you!
Damn you three!
Mr. Canning.
You've hurt the one person I love
more than anything on this planet.
Your wife was working here as...
She's sobbing at home!
She's inconsolable.
You know, I've never, in-in all our years of struggle,
I have never gone after any of your family members.
We have no family members.
It's always been business first, but no more.
And I-I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.
I'd watch your words, Mr. Canning.
I want to be methodical about this; I want to take my time.
Just know this-- I will pull you three apart
until there's nothing left.
What can he do?
Nothing.
He's a wounded beast, crying out.
Best just to turn away.
I was handcuffed in a small room.
With bars?
Yes.
Was there anyone else in this room?
Now and then, they'd bring someone in,
cuff him beside me and then take him out.
Were you fed?
Once.
A bologna sandwich.
Did anyone tell you
that you could have an attorney?
No.
Why did you confess?
Because they said they'd let me go.
Your Honor,
Homan Square has been called Chicago's "Black Site"
Come on.
Well, what else would you call it?
A place where citizens are taken without warrant,
without warning, without rights,
and then questioned until they confess.
Now, Your Honor, I am staggered
that we still have to stand here
and argue over the legality of this.
The confession should be thrown out, Your Honor.
It was coerced.
He was a danger to himself,
that's why we cuffed him.
It's police policy.
Why did you not tell him his rights?
Because he was not under arrest.
Thank you, Officer.
When the judge ordered you
to grant me access to Mr. Rickter,
did you deny it to me?
I'm embarrassed to say that I did.
I made a mistake.
I thought it was Mr. Rickter who had a lawyer,
but it was another person.
What was the name of this "other person"?
You know, I don't remember.
Really? How surprising.
The snark is uncalled for, Your Honor.
The simple truth, ma'am,
is that we did nothing wrong.
Your client confessed
while he was in our care
and not under arrest.
I'd be more upset about your client's crimes
than about our mistakes.
So we need someone on the inside
to substantiate Rickter's account.
Officer Tannerman?
Do you think he'll talk?
Our best bet.
You sounded good in court today.
Yeah? The speech?
I don't give many of those-- I was angry.
And look how effective that was.
Well, it looks good on you-- anger.
I got to go.
Right, I know.
Yeah, it's getting late.
9:00.
Well, if I stay, I'll just get sloppy, and then...
something or other,
and then I don't know what will happen.
Something bad?
Very bad.
Mrs. Florrick.
It's kismet.
I just was knocking on your door.
Really?
Do you have a minute?
Sure.
Do you want me to wait here?
No, come on in.
I hate to return to old subjects,
but, uh, Kalinda promised to meet with Mr. Bishop yesterday,
and she never showed up.
Do you know what happened?
No.
Well, has Kalinda been in touch with you?
Just one moment, Mr. Lester.
What is that?
It's Kalinda's letter to me.
Why did you do that?
I didn't want you to have it.
What did it say?
It said good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Lester.
Now, your fellow officer stated
that Mr. Rickter was a danger to himself and others.
Was that your observation, too?
Officer Tannerman?
I was not in a position to make any observation.
But you saw Mr. Rickter being brought in to Homan Square?
No, I did not.
You didn't?
But you told Mrs. Florrick
that you saw her client being brought in.
Yes, I made a mistake.
Oh, you made a mistake that you saw Mr. Rickter.
Oh, well...
Yes, I only heard over the radio
that they were bringing in a 10-26.
That's all.
10-26-- you're sure that was, that was Jacob Rickter?
Yes, that's all I know.
I didn't actually see them bring him in.
10-26.
10-2... what is a 10-26, Officer?
Chicago Police Code for detained arrestee.
And Jacob Rickter was that detained arrestee.
Objection. Counselor is putting words in the witness' mouth.
From their own words, Your Honor.
Because they believe that our client was already under arrest,
and therefore he should have been Mirandized
and offered the services of a lawyer.
This was a slip on the radio, Your Honor, that's all.
Officer Tannerman,
did you clearly hear Mr. Rickter referred to
by the 10-26 designation?
Yes, I did.
Then I have no choice
but throw out the confession of Mr. Rickter.
Yes!
Motion sustained, we are adjourned.
Good job, partner.
So this phone here, could you tell me something ab...?
Hello.
Ah, thank you, Kalinda.
Hate getting new phones.
So you didn't show up for your talk with Bishop.
Uh, he was disappointed.
I was planning to see him, but then I realized
Bishop's leaving the business.
He's giving it all to Dexter,
so what's the point in meeting him?
He has no power.
I don't think it's a good idea
to test Mr. Bishop's power.
Why not?
Because he has people like me working for him.
You know, uh, I downloaded a flash drive of data
from Bishop's computer,
and it had receipts and notes on your, uh, employment.
But I didn't see a reason
to give it to the state's attorney's office.
You could always give me a reason.
That's a bluff.
No.
What is it with all these tough-talking women?
You know a word you don't hear very much anymore?
Demure.
How about bringing that one back?
Sounds like you're stalling.
All right, okay.
I couldn't find you, I looked and looked,
but you were gone.
Now, don't make me a liar by coming back, okay?
Don't worry.
Wait.
Are you sure you wouldn't want to start up something together?
A business?
We could dominate.
No, uh...
I'm good.
Oh, good.
Hi.
I was just thinking about the other night.
Yeah, me, too.
And I was thinking that we can really make this work.
I was looking online at office spaces,
and if we don't want too much space, it's really pretty cheap.
Alicia.
That doesn't sound good.
I can't be doing this.
Doing what?
There's, um...
something...
between us.
And we push it,
and then we say we won't,
and then we push it again, and...
I can't live that way.
I can't.
We don't have to push it.
I know.
But it's not always "Do" Or "Don't."
I don't want to work alone.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
But... I have to go.
Bye.
Stupid...
Stupid.
Want a partner?
