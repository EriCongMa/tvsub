i cannot wait to see this .
it &apos;s generating oscar buzz .
i started that !
i thought i did !
i just talked to my agent ..
and the premiere is next week and you &apos;re all invited !
will we take a limo ?
sure !
i love taking limos when nobody died .
well , i won &apos;t be able to come .
for those who haven &apos;t checked their calendars , today &apos;s my due date .
you should come . maybe you &apos;ll have the baby in the limo .
that way for the first few moments of her life , she &apos;ll think we &apos;re really fancy .
i want to thank you guys for how great you &apos;ve been during this .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you . i loved these last 9 months .
i &apos;m looking forward to the next part ..
i am really gonna miss being pregnant .
that &apos;s right . still no baby .
what &apos;s the matter ? is the puffy , sweaty pregnant lady ..
disturbing your precious coffee time ?
come on , people , make some room .
sweetie , maybe you &apos;d be more comfortable here .
you .
like you haven &apos;t done enough .
i know you &apos;re miserable . i wish there was something i could do .
i wish i were a sea horse .
because with sea horses , it &apos;s the male . they carry the babies .
and then also , i &apos;d be far away in the sea .
god .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life .
i know . i remember toward the end ..
that &apos;s a great story . tell it while you &apos;re getting me some iced tea .
oh , god , get out ! get out , get out , get out !
let &apos;s .
the.one.where.rachel.is.late
hey , did you have the baby yet ?
do you want me to sit on you ? because i &apos;ll do it .
what are you doing here ?
they sent me home from work .
they said , &quot; start your maternity leave now . just rest . &quot;
you know what ? screw them !
if they don &apos;t want me there , i &apos;ll hang out with you guys .
or you could do volunteer work .
hello ?
joey , it &apos;s estelle .
i was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere .
you told me i could have six tickets .
i sold four on ebay .
you &apos;ll be sitting next to hotguy 372 .
so that &apos;s it ? i only get to bring one guest ?
yeah . what time you wanna pick me up ?
hello ?
you hear that ? i only get one extra ticket to my premiere .
so somehow i have to pick between you three and ross .
what about me ?
you said you didn &apos;t want to go .
i don &apos;t . but i would still like to be acknowledged .
because i &apos;m pregnant , i &apos;m invisible ?
definitely not invisible .
ross didn &apos;t care enough to be here , so he &apos;s out .
you snooze , you lose .
he &apos;s not snoozing . he &apos;s teaching .
well , then somebody &apos;s snoozing .
and , joey , not that this should affect you at all , but if you pick me ..
i was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here .
i haven &apos;t seen this dress .
star in a movie .
pick whoever you want . listen to your heart . what does it tell you ?
phoebe . phoebe . phoebe .
well ..
i think i want to take chandler .
phoebe , phoebe , phoebe .
you want to take me ?
yeah , i wish i could take everybody .
but chandler &apos;s always supported my career .
he &apos;s paid for acting classes , headshots and stuff .
this will be my way of paying you back .
so you &apos;re never actually going to pay me back ?
just because he paid for your headshots , you &apos;re gonna take him ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re comprehending just how slutty this dress is .
it &apos;s not just the stuff he paid for . it &apos;s everything , you know ?
he read lines with me . he went with me on auditions when i was nervous .
then he consoled me after i didn &apos;t get parts that i wanted .
you always believed in me , man , even when i didn &apos;t .
i always knew you were gonna make it . i &apos;m so proud of you .
thanks , that means a lot to me .
mon , maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress .
i &apos;m gonna go shave .
yeah , well , i &apos;m gonna go spit .
i have to pee .
if i don &apos;t come out , it &apos;s because i &apos;ve choked to death on the potpourri stink .
you hold her nose , i &apos;ll blow in her mouth and the kid &apos;ll just .. out of her .
she &apos;s a week late . she &apos;s got to have it today .
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s still gonna be a while .
care to make it interesting ?
i bet you she &apos;ll have it tomorrow .
you &apos;re on .
okay , how much ?
one hundred thousand dollars .
how about 50 bucks ?
i &apos;ll call zurich and move some money .
all right , whose turn is it to help me get up ?
no one &apos;s here .
oh , damn it !
this is exciting . so glamorous ! people taking our picture . how do i look ?
a little tall .
what ?
would you crouch down a bit so that i look taller ?
there you go .
it &apos;s just so glamorous .
oh , hey , mon ? rach is here .
and you &apos;re still pregnant .
i &apos;m sorry . i know how uncomfortable you are .
you know what ? you look great . yeah , like 50 bucks .
i have to go pee . apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy .
damn it . here &apos;s your 50 bucks .
that &apos;s interesting that you lost . now , i forget , do you like to lose ?
all right , stop it .
double or nothing she has it tomorrow .
fine .
until then , general grant , why don &apos;t you set up camp .. right there ?
rachel here ? we have an appointment .
in the bathroom .
rach , we gotta go .
in a minute !
people ask why we &apos;re not together . i just don &apos;t know what to tell them .
all right , let &apos;s go .
oh , wait a minute .
do i have to pee again ?
no , i &apos;m good .
do you want to go change first ?
the doctor &apos;s staying open late for us , but if you hurry ..
no , i &apos;m fine .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s inappropriate ?
what ?
good god , man . don &apos;t anger it .
ross , it is 100 degrees outside . for the first time in weeks , i am ..
fine . whatever you want . you &apos;re the mommy .
no ! don &apos;t call me &quot; mommy . &quot;
it &apos;s bad enough you call your own mother that .
i &apos;m actually with her on this one .
come on , ross . we &apos;re gonna be late .
either of you want to be ross ?
i thought i knew who the enemy was , but it was you .
okay , this is it . this is my big fight scene coming up .
i &apos;m fighting for every man in the 82nd ground division .
ross ? can i ask you something ?
when carol was pregnant with ben ..
were you this irritating ?
excuse me ?
nothing . you &apos;re just ..
you &apos;ve been a little short with me lately . i &apos;m not trying to irritate you .
well , then , you must have a natural talent for it .
the doctor will be in soon . why don &apos;t we not speak until then ?
okay .
seriously . breathe louder , ross . that &apos;s great .
we should ask the doctor if she even knows ..
how to deliver a baby that &apos;s half human , half pure evil !
hi , dr. long . how are you ?
you &apos;re nice to her .
she has the drugs .
we &apos;ll do a quick check .
ok
eight days late , huh ? you must be getting uncomfortable .
yeah , just a tad .
you &apos;re 80 % effaced . you &apos;re on your way . it still could last a while .
there are ways to help things along .
do them !
actually , they &apos;re things that you can do . home remedies .
in my experience , i &apos;ve found some are very effective .
well , we are ready to try anything .
there &apos;s an herbal tea you can drink .
you can take some castor oil . there &apos;s spicy foods .
we will do all of those .
taking a long walk .
good . done .
and there &apos;s the one that &apos;s proved most effective : sex .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me !
good job , joe ! well done ! top @-@ notch !
you liked it ? you really liked it ?
oh , yeah !
well , which part exactly ?
the whole thing ! here we go !
no , no , no . give me some specifics .
i loved the specifics . the specifics were the best part .
hey , what about the scene with the kangaroo ? did you like that part ?
i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic .
you fell asleep !
there was no kangaroo ! they didn &apos;t take any of my suggestions !
i can &apos;t believe you fell asleep .
i can &apos;t believe it either .
maybe it didn &apos;t happen .
maybe you fell asleep and dreamt the whole thing .
and this conversation we &apos;re having right now is part of that dream .
wake up , joe !
thanks for coming . see you later .
don &apos;t go . i &apos;m so sorry .
look , this guy fell asleep ! he fell asleep too ! be mad at him !
or call an ambulance !
what did the doctor say ? any news on when the baby will come ?
no . she gave us ideas on how to induce labor .
we tried them all .
we went for a walk , we tried tea , castor oil , spicy food . nothing worked .
there is one thing we didn &apos;t try .
but someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms .
if it &apos;s gonna help bring the baby here , today ..
i think you should do it .
it &apos;s sex .
do it !
monica .
it &apos;s been a really long time for you .
i mean , women have needs . do it . get yours .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that .
i think if the two of you had sex , the repercussions would be catastrophic .
all right , let &apos;s be practical .
if ross isn &apos;t willing , he &apos;s not the only guy you can have sex with .
you could borrow chandler . chandler is good .
okay , okay . yeah , i don &apos;t think i wanna do that .
you sure ? i &apos;m just saying ..
the baby &apos;s head isn &apos;t getting any smaller .
monica , what is the matter with you ?
i just want the baby to be born today .
why today ?
okay , fine .
i bet phoebe that you &apos;re gonna have the baby , and i don &apos;t want to lose .
what ? while she &apos;s been going through this hell , you &apos;ve been making money ?
you &apos;re betting on your friend staying in this misery ?
i &apos;ll take that bet .
what ?
i &apos;m miserable . i may as well make some money out of it .
can i get some of that action ?
i &apos;m betting against all of you ?
i really feel like tomorrow it &apos;s gonna happen .
okay .
sixty , 80,100 .
and 50 .
and two .
yeah , baby .
hey , sleeping beauty .
where have you been ? i want to talk to you . i still feel bad .
oh , no . were you upset ? did you lose sleep ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
the reason i came over is to settle things between us . you &apos;ve done a lot for me .
i wanted to pay you back with the premiere , but you missed it .
so how much do i owe you ?
what ?
i don &apos;t want to owe you anything .
you don &apos;t owe me .
i don &apos;t want your ..
we &apos;re doing this !
you got me my first headshots . how much ?
i don &apos;t know , $ 500 .
okay , $ 500 . what else ?
then there was the second set . the infamous &quot; booger &quot; headshots .
okay , so that &apos;s another $ 500 . that &apos;s 500 and 500 . that &apos;s ..
you want a calculator ?
please .
here .
all right , what else ?
well , there &apos;s acting classes , stage @-@ combat classes , tap classes ..
which we &apos;re still keeping under our hats .
that dialect coach who helped you with a southern accent .
which , after 20 hours of lessons , still came out jamaican .
what the hell are you talking about ? the south will rise again , man .
yes , money well @-@ spent .
okay , what else ? rent .
two , three years of rent , utilities , food ..
okay , so i &apos;m writing you a check for ..
so you fell asleep during my movie . big deal , right ?
how do you clear this thing ?
finish your enchilada .
ross , we &apos;ve tried all the spicy food . it &apos;s not working .
okay , here , have one of these peppers .
oh , god . so hot . oh , my god .
by the way , you don &apos;t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye .
i am feeling nothing .
speaking of hot , watching you do that ..
really makes me want to have sex with you .
stop it .
come on ! why are we wasting time ?
we know it &apos;s gonna work . it &apos;s doctor @-@ recommended .
i &apos;m sorry . but we have to have some boundaries . my god , i &apos;m dying .
we &apos;ve done it before . we &apos;ll do it again .
it &apos;ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy .
i &apos;m not gonna make love to you so you &apos;ll go into labor .
make love ? what are you , a girl ?
always a great way to get into a man &apos;s pants .
you &apos;ll be performing a service . think of me as a ketchup bottle .
sometimes , you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out .
i love when you talk dirty to me .
i know it . you &apos;re right . that &apos;s not sexy .
oh , i seem to have dropped my fork .
let me just bend over and get it .
oh , god !
okay , enough . this is not going to happen .
come on , ross . i &apos;m miserable here .
come on , you started this , now you finish it !
come on , wuss . make love to me .
you know what ?
what ?
forget it .
what now , ross , you &apos;re not gonna talk ?
how on earth will you ever annoy me ?
oh , wait a minute , i know .
you &apos;d think the jalapeno would clear up your sinuses , but no !
that &apos;s not enough .. what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting that baby out of you !
oh , god !
i know .
oh , no , no , no .
i think my water just broke .
i am good !
okay , i got the pillow . i got the bag .
you got the keys ?
i got the keys .
we &apos;re having a baby .
i didn &apos;t have time to read this part of the books , but do we have time .. ?
not so much .
okay , let &apos;s go .
200 .
thank you .
that &apos;s it . i don &apos;t care when the baby comes . no more betting .
okay .
hello ?
i guess we could bet one more time .
is rachel having the baby ?
how did you know that ?
joey ! chandler !
they &apos;re at the coffee house .
you know everything !
wait . i bet you the baby is over 7 pounds .
i bet you it has hair ! i bet you it &apos;s a girl .
