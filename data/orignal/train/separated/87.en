I understand there are some questions
about my opponent's hiring and promotion practices
over at the State's Attorney's office.
I don't intend to speak to that.
But I do think diversity is a fair...
"But I do think diversity..."
A little under the weather?
Oh, just a little.
You needed me?
Yes, how's it feel to be an equity partner?
Good.
The power surging through you?
Something's surging through me.
So the, um, Bishop defense.
I was looking over the billable hours.
They're coming in a bit high.
That's usually not a problem,
but Bishop is a top legacy client.
We don't want him to think we're padding him.
So, I need you to rein it in.
Um, that's Cary's team.
Do you want me to get him?
No. That's your team.
You're the equity partner in charge,
as of now.
Right, I will get right on that.
Just find out if the hours are being inflated.
And if they're not,
steer the group onto a more conservative path.
What's up?
Oh, I need to head out this afternoon.
I was hoping you could look over the civil proposal.
There's another cold.
You two need to stay away from me.
Um, do you need anything else, Diane?
No, thank you.
Hi.
I was thrilled to get your call.
This is a working lunch.
I know.
But I was thrilled.
Your wiretap has been thrown out, Mr. Perrotti.
Uh, Josh.
Your wiretap has been found inadmissible, Josh.
You have nothing on my client
so we ask the Department of Justice
to cease and desist from harassing Eli Gold.
I ordered for us.
I hope that wasn't presumptuous.
Well, I'm not that hungry.
You were saying?
I was? What was I...? Oh.
Here you are in Petra Moritz's column.
"Is Florrick strategist, Eli Gold, off the hook yet?
"Not according to a conversation
"overheard at Parrillan
between a certain unnamed source
and AUSA Josh Perrotti."
Well, they misspelled my name.
"I know personally Eli Gold was buying votes.
He's going down; He's going down hard"
So, Josh, are we on a witch hunt?
The problem is, Elsbeth,
you and I are a lot alike.
We're competitive.
Onion naan?
No, thank you.
And I know Eli is guilty.
So,
I found another way to prove the charge.
Conspiracy.
Really?
Well, conspiracy requires a coconspirator.
And who might that be?
This unnamed source at Parrillan?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
No, that's for me to know, too.
Discovery.
Then take me to court.
You want me to take you to court?
I can't wait for you to take me to court.
I love the shape of your lips.
You leave my lips out of it.
I can't. They're so pillowy.
Look...
all you have to do is go to prison once
on a false corruption charge,
and you're going to take it very, very seriously.
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
Miss Hayward, you have two minutes to respond.
I don't need two minutes to respond.
I just need two words: "Eli Gold."
Peter's own campaign manager
is accused of corruption...
Uh, he is no longer my campaign manager.
Eli Gold has resigned.
Yes, but you can understand
why I should take your intolerance
for corruption with a grain of salt.
Well, unlike Miss Hayward,
I like to get all the facts before I make a judgement.
But you said that Eli Gold is off of your campaign.
No, I said he resigned.
So you do accept corruption or you would've fired him.
What I don't accept are having my words
twisted into something
Uh, Peter.
Peter. Peter.
Which is not what I...
Let's take ten.
Peter.
Here's the thing:
You're tall.
And you're much taller than the actual Maddie.
So, when you go after her like that,
it looks like you're bullying.
Should I crouch?
No, she's the one down in the polls.
Make her look desperate.
Keep your words calm, noncombative.
Don't go aggressive.
You know, absorb the punches.
Like Obama, in his first debate.
No, this is different.
This is about the women's vote.
You go angry, you're going to remind women
of their first husbands.
Excuse me. Yeah.
I hope that was all right.
No, that's why you're here.
Don't let up on me, because she won't.
By the way, thanks for doing this.
Oh, my pleasure.
So, I hear the State's Attorney's office
is looking for a new outside firm
to represent it on its civil suits.
You heard about Brandelsky & Turner going bankrupt?
Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot.
I know we were allowed to pitch the first time around.
I hope we're allowed to pitch the second.
Well, unfortunately, it's not up to me.
I've put together a team of ASAs to interview.
But, you know what?
I'm going to... I'm going to tell them that you're interested.
Thank you. That'd be great.
Once more into the fray?
Oh, you're going down.
Oh, we'll see.
How're you going to do this?
Do what?
Find out who this coconspirator is?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Don't you have a plan?
I don't plan.
You're a crazy woman.
Reservation?
Hello.
I'm Mr. Joshua Perrotti's personal assistant,
and he came in here yesterday for lunch.
He was supposed to give his number
to his waitperson regarding a personal matter.
But he doesn't remember the name of his waitperson.
Um, is there-is there any way
you could find out who served him?
He was here for lunch?
12:30, 1:00 reservation.
Perrotti, Perrotti.
I don't see it.
Do you know who he was having lunch with?
May I take a peak?
Frank Landau of the DNC.
You turned on me?
What?
You went to the Feds?
What do you want, Eli?
They're using you to get to me.
Who said that?
You got yourself printed up in Petra Moritz
saying I paid for votes.
They're coming after me, Eli.
So you threw me to them?
My head and my career were on the chopping block.
You'd do the same.
What do they have, Frank, huh?
What did you give them?
You got to calm down, Eli.
They're coming after me.
You calm the hell down.
I don't know you.
Anything I did wrong was at your prompting, Frank.
I don't know you, and this encounter never happened.
I will find a way to bring you down.
I'm going into my office,
and I'm not listening to another word being said.
So all our attempts at bail have failed.
Lemond Bishop is still considered a flight risk.
We have three briefs ready for pretrial hearings.
Hello, Alicia.
Alicia's recently been named equity partner.
Let's give her a hand.
Thank you.
Okay, so, we're good to go on all three briefs.
Everyone should pull on
four or five more associates to get those ready...
Actually...
Yes?
2 申请变更审判地
Do we really need all three?
The jurisdictional brief,
it seems like...
Well, it seems the same as brief number two.
Well, last time we were together,
we all thought that was a good idea.
Yes, and I'm wondering now if it's a doubling of effort.
Well, let's vote again.
Who thinks we should pull back on the jurisdictional brief?
Just raise your hands.
Maybe it's not about dropping the brief.
Is there any way we could be more conservative
in our approach to it?
Sure.
Do you want to take charge of that?
Okay, sure.
He's playing keep-away.
We are not withholding.
Due course passed a long time ago.
We are following the law.
No, no, no, that is not...
That is right, we have complied with every request...
They clearly haven't complied with every request
or I wouldn't be...
Stop.
Let us stop, please.
Mr. Perrotti, this is not justice by ambush.
We must offer the defense discovery here.
Once we have it, Your Honor.
But any premature release may damage our case.
How would it damage your case?
Counselor, please.
By allowing the defense
to dissuade our witnesses from testifying.
Excuse me, when did we...
Mr. Perrotti,
do you have any reason for this charge?
We have, Your Honor.
We'd like to call Mr. Frank Landau to the stand.
And you were a witness to Eli Gold purchasing votes?
Yes.
And you conspired with him?
Yes.
And you had a pang of conscience and you came to me?
Yes.
Hmm, and what happened yesterday?
Eli Gold discovered that I was going to accuse him.
He showed up at my office.
He was violent and disruptive.
Did you fear he might hurt you?
Yes, he knocked my keys from my hand.
Oh, my God, he knocked away your keys?
Counselor, please.
Your Honor, the point is clear.
Defense can't be trusted with discovery,
not at such an early stage, anyway.
Okay, that was my mistake.
What does Landau have on you, Eli?
I don't know, there's nothing.
No scheme to buy votes?
No, and if he says there was, he is lying.
Well, they need some kind of corroboration to convict you.
So we need to know what he's going to say.
And how do we do that?
I don't know.
We have to think.
Yes?
What?
You just had a thought.
I think I did.
Hello.
The real estate office is two doors down.
Is this the Democratic headquarters?
Yeah.
And you're Frank Landau?
Yeah, why?
You've been served.
Oh, hell.
What for?
Defamation.
Are you kidding me?
I'm just the messenger.
Damn it, Eli.
So, I hear you want our business.
I want your business?
The State's Attorney's business, our civil suits?
Oh, yes, are you on the committee?
Don't sound so surprised.
That wasn't surprise, it was awe.
Here's our application-- please fill it out.
We're starting to hear pitches this afternoon.
Aw, poor boy, you have a cold.
Ah, getting over it.
And we'll be judged fairly?
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, we won a few cases against you.
Oh, yes, well, we'll just have to overcome
our bitterness at your one-case winning streak.
Alicia, good, there you are.
Do you have a minute?
I do.
Um, I need some help with the Eli Gold case.
Actually I don't think we can help you in federal court.
Yes-- oh, no, not that; this is in civil court.
Civil court-- how did this end up in civil court?
Well, it's in both courts, actually.
It's not as confusing as it sounds.
We're suing the-- ooh, I like those earrings.
Thanks. So...
We're suing the head of the Democratic Committee for defamation.
Why?
He said some nasty things about Eli in a gossip column.
Okay, I don't understand the connection.
You know how hard it is to win in defamation.
Yes, we don't want to win.
You don't?
No, we want the defense to ask for a dismissal.
Then we'll be able to put
Frank Landau on the stand in civil court
to find out what he intends to say
against Eli in federal court.
It's not as strange as it sounds.
Really?
You're funny.
So you'll help us?
You want me to playact a lawyer
in your sham defamation lawsuit?
Pretty much, yes.
This is not a sham, Your Honor.
We take the defamation of our client very seriously.
Their motive is so nakedly obvious,
Your Honor, it's almost comical.
There is nothing comical about the ruining of our client's...
We strenuously insist that this case be dismissed with prejudice.
I can hear perfectly.
Nobody needs to yell.
Counselor, I've read the petitions.
This is third-party defamation?
Exactly-- Mr. Landau didn't print this comment.
He didn't scream it from the rooftops.
Yes, because he didn't have to.
He was in a public place-- Parrillan--
and he should have known his comments could be easily overheard.
She's right, Counselor.
Third-party public declaration is still defamatory.
Are you arguing for a dismissal?
Yes, Your Honor,
we move for a dismissal with prejudice.
No.
Excuse me, sir, do you have business here?
I seem to now.
You don't want a dismissal.
Your Honor, the plaintiff asks
to present witnesses against this motion.
Okay, what's going on?
Mr. Perrotti is a Department of Justice lawyer...
...who wants to use this defamation suit
to fuel his prosecution of our client.
Wait a minute, just the opposite.
You're with the Department of Justice?
I am, Your Honor.
Good, well, then, shut up.
Present your witnesses, Counselor.
We call Mr. Frank Landau to the stand.
Damn it.
What?
Did you say the following, sir?
"I know personally Eli Gold was buying votes."
I did.
And you still insist this was not defamatory?
I do.
And why is that?
It's true.
Really?
And how do you know it's true?
Your Honor,
this testimony will seriously undermine
a current Department of Justice investigation.
We ask that it be delayed.
Mr. Perrotti...
AUSA Perrotti.
Yes.
You have no standing in this court,
and furthermore I don't like the Department of Justice,
so please sit down and stop interrupting.
Again, Mr. Landau, how do you know
this statement to be true?
I arranged the meeting for Eli to buy votes.
Any ideas?
And with who did you arrange this meeting?
You must answer, Mr. Landau.
The meeting was with Hugh Saxon.
And what is Mr. Saxon's job description?
He's CEO of Greengate Retirement Centers.
Are you crazy?
That wasn't to buy votes.
Mr. Gold, stop.
And you witnessed this meeting
between Mr. Saxon and Mr. Gold?
Yes.
Mr. Florrick's mother was to speak
at one of his convalescent homes.
And in what way were these votes bought?
Mr. Gold was worried
that he wouldn't get enough votes to make
a strong enough showing at the Democratic straw poll,
so Mr. Saxon promised to bus 600 senior citizens
to the straw poll
to pack the vote for Peter Florrick--
your husband.
Alicia, do you mind giving us a moment?
I do, actually.
This has nothing to do with Peter.
You packed the vote?
I did what everyone does, I...
Wait a minute.
No, Alicia,
you may be subject to subpoena in federal court.
No, I enjoy attorney-client privilege.
Only if you have no previous knowledge of this
as the wife of the candidate.
Peter doesn't know you packed the straw poll?
I didn't pack it.
It was a Democratic outreach to involve seniors in the process.
In trade for a discount
on Greengate's crisis management?
Not in trade.
Coincidentally, at the same time.
That's all.
You didn't rein in your hours, Alicia.
We're still working on it.
Well, there are more associates involved
in the Bishop case than before.
You need to assert your authority.
I've gone over the work, Diane, it's all necessary.
Part of asserting my authority is telling you that.
Well, here's another part.
Find a way to cut ten percent of their billable hours.
It's all right.
You over your cold?
Yes.
You?
Getting there.
Alicia, it's okay.
We're not gonna act on it.
Again.
Yes, again.
It was a mistake, it happened, but that's it.
We can't... avoid each other.
You're right.
I'll see you around.
See you.
Yes, I met with Eli Gold.
You're with his defense team?
I am.
The prosecution says that you met with Mr. Gold
for the purposes of voter fraud.
I have an agreement with the Department of Justice
which prevents me from going into these matters.
Yeah, is that regarding arranging transport
for seniors staying in your homes?
Again, I really can't say.
All right, then, let me just say this.
I think that the Department of Justice
is trying to scare you...
This, um, this picture,
this one here... is that taken from the straw poll?
Yes.
Do you have any more from that day?
We probably do.
Why?
Hey, do you want to have dinner tonight?
What?
Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Why?
What do you mean, why?
No, I mean, who with?
Oh, no, not the campaign, just us.
What?
A date?
No, not a date,
uh... just...
Okay, a date.
Okay.
Good.
You know that Jordan says that if Maddie attacks me
in tomorrow's debate, that I should back off
so that I don't look like a bully.
You think that's smart?
I think you should call Eli and ask him.
I haven't, uh, been talking to Eli.
I know.
I think you should call Eli.
We book over $55 million in yearly client fees
and we do this by providing individualized service.
The primary reason we're one of the few large firms
left standing is because we don't forget
it's all about the client.
Now, I was told ten minutes,
but I could go on for another 30.
You have any questions?
No, this is great.
Good presentation.
Thank you.
Actually I have a question.
Ms. Hellinger.
You represent the drug dealer Lemond Bishop, don't you?
I don't think we need to go into that.
Won't that prove difficult,
representing Chicago's top drug dealer
while at the same time representing us?
Obviously there's always a Chinese Wall
between the service I would supply for you and the service
others in our firm would supply for Mr. Bishop.
Thank you, very helpful.
That's it, a Chinese wall?
Well, if we had to make other adjustments, we'd be willing.
Okay, thank you.
Have you seen these photos before, Mr. Saxon?
Yes, I took them.
And could you tell this court
what event is documented in these photos?
Yes, the Democratic straw poll four months ago.
And you arranged transportation
for the seniors pictured here to be at this straw poll?
Yes.
Now, the prosecution,
in the form of the formidable Mr. Perrotti--
he has suggested that this was
an attempt to stack the deck in favor of Mr. Florrick
at this poll. Is that true?
No.
Uh, as you can see, the seniors involved voted
for all three of the candidates.
You're referring to their T-shirts?
The shirts represented which candidates they support?
Yes.
Only a third of the seniors voted for Mr. Florrick.
Objection-- we don't know how they voted.
We just know what color shirts they wore.
That is true as far as it goes.
Now, the prosecution... Josh Perrotti--
also has presented a witness.
This witness-- Mr. Landau--
claims that you had a deal:
that Mr. Gold discounted his services
in trade for this transport of seniors.
That is untrue.
Your Honor, Mr. Landau's testimony
swearing to this supposed conversation isn't enough.
He needs corroboration.
Mr. Saxon was that corroboration,
and as you can see,
Mr. Saxon insists that conversation never took place.
Yes, Mr. Perrotti,
we are prone to dismiss this suit.
Actually, Your Honor,
Mr. Saxon was not the only eyewitness.
Really, who else?
A witness I will make available tomorrow, Your Honor.
My father used to have dinner with him
every night-- well, not every night.
Mrs. Florrick?
Yes, hello. Do I know you?
No, you don't, but you look exactly like my grandmother.
Really?
Yes, and I'm sorry to say this, but you've been served.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
All right, well, hang in there.
No, I'll be fine.
We'll talk later.
Hey, I'm ready.
Let me have it.
Have what?
Your phone.
Are you feeling threatened?
No.
No, but I do know that there can only be one captain.
Eli will tell you the same thing.
The surest way to screw up a campaign
is to listen to two captains.
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
Then, give me your phone.
I trust you, but I like my phone.
Peter... you can't call Eli.
Okay.
Is this a courting, a stalking or a...
casual drop-by?
What am I missing?
What are you missing?
With the pitch.
You were a little north of hostile.
You're joking, right?
Was this just to show me up,
bring me into the pitch so you can cut me off at the knees
in front of Geneva Pine?
Yep, that's me.
Well, thanks a lot.
Are you really this dense?
I got the message.
Geneva Pine was against you.
She wasn't against me until you started asking your questions.
She was being polite.
That's why I was asking the hard questions.
She doesn't want Lockhart-Gardner
because you represent a drug dealer.
That's why I was asking--
I was giving you a chance.
But thanks for your understanding.
Hello, Jackie.
I don't think we should be talking, Mr. Gold.
Jackie, I need to know if you're gonna...
what you're gonna say.
I'm going to tell the truth, Mr. Gold.
Alicia, I could use your help.
Yes. I am on my way right now.
Mm-hmm. Bye.
Got a second?
No.
Got the revised billing statement on the Bishop case.
You cut my hours?
It's coming from the top.
Forgive me, but aren't you also a partner on this case?
Let's talk about this later, Cary.
Alicia, you cut my billables,
it screws me come promotion time,
and I prefer not to have the rug
yanked out from under me a second time.
Right now let's just focus on winning for Bishop.
Jacqueline Florrick.
You're the mother of current
Cook County State's Attorney Peter Florrick?
And future Illinois Governor
Peter Florrick, yes.
Mm. Mrs. Florrick,
on October 18, 2012,
did you give a speech in support of your son's campaign
to the residents of the Greengate retirement Center
in Northbrook?
Yes.
Was Eli Gold also present?
Yes.
He arranged for me to speak there.
I'm sure he wanted to ensure I stayed on point.
At the reception afterwards,
did you talk with Mr. Gold
and Greengate CEO Hugh Saxon?
Why, yes.
And what was discussed?
Arthritis.
I don't mean to be funny.
The facility was offering wonderful new therapy...
Was anything else discussed, Mrs. Florrick?
Well... Jewish stuff.
"Jewish stuff""
And-and what is "Jewish stuff"?
Mm, the Sabbath and-and a Seder.
A Seder is a dinner.
She's doing this to get back at me.
For what?
For everything.
Was anything of a political nature discussed?
Actually, much of a political nature was discussed,
but Mr. Gold doesn't like it when I discuss politics,
so often I just listen.
When you were listening, did you hear
Mr. Gold and Mr. Saxon agree on a deal?
I don't know if I would call it a deal.
They had an agreement.
Did Mr. Gold agree to cut his crisis-management fee
in return for Mr. Saxon transporting Greengate residents
to the Cook County straw poll
to vote for your son?
That sounds about right.
We need to poke a hole in what she heard.
We could impeach her as a witness.
How?
Well, Jackie had a stroke last year.
She's had problem with her memory and orientation.
That's right. Exactly!
She's easily confused?
Like a blind donkey.
But she does not like it being pointed out,
so you have to be very careful.
She also doesn't like me,
'cause I cut down on her speaking schedule.
And the Jewish stuff?
And the Jewish stuff.
Looks expensive.
It is.
You don't know wine.
You bought it 'cause you like the picture on the label.
Pretty mountain.
See the wagon?
It's very lovely.
Okay. I forgive you.
I didn't know I was apologizing.
You were...
in your own way.
By the way, you... you didn't get our business.
You were cut after the first round.
You, uh... you want your bottle back?
No. Keep it.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Hello.
You testified that
you gave a campaign speech
at the Greengate Retirement Center in Northbrook on October 18?
Yes.
What specifically did you talk about in this speech?
Objection. Relevance.
The alleged deal took place
after a speech by Mrs. Florrick.
It's all part of a whole, Your Honor.
Yes, but the fact that Mrs. Florrick
spoke about the retirement age hardly matters.
Objection, Your Honor.
If the counselor wants to get on the stand,
I'll swear him in.
Okay. You're both overruled.
You can answer, Mrs. Florrick.
I spoke on the retirement age
and other things.
Mrs. Florrick, you testified that after your speech
you participated in a conversation with
Eli Gold and Greengate CEO Hugh Saxon?
If you say so.
Yes...
You said this, during Mr. Perrotti's questioning.
Well, I-I go to so many of these events,
for Peter, and, uh, they-they all
tend to blur into each other.
Mrs. Florrick, are you saying
you don't remember this meeting?
I suffered a stroke several months ago,
and it's left me with, uh,
shall we say...
cognitive... issues.
Did you talk to her about this?
No.
Do you recall if Eli Gold was even at this event?
Objection. Asked and answered.
And the witness may have erred
in that earlier testimony.
Overruled.
Again, Mrs. Florrick, do you recall
if Mr. Gold was present when you spoke
at the Greengate Retirement Center?
Ms. Tascioni...
there are days when I can't even recall my own name.
Thank you. No more questions.
So, why'd you do that?
It's the truth, isn't it?
The issue on the table
is whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate
Mr. Gold arranged and agreed to a vote-bribery deal.
I was fully convinced there was,
until Mrs. Florrick's admission about her cognitive challenges.
Which I'm afraid, Mr. Perrotti,
leaves you with only Frank Landau's testimony,
and that is not enough to bring to the jury.
So we have no choice but to disqualify...
Your Honor, we wish to amend out complaint
and add a new coconspirator to the charge.
Objection!
I know Mr. Perrotti is highly competitive and aggressive
and wants to assert himself,
but you were about to dismiss.
Your Honor, you previously approved our extension
for the production of our discovery.
We submit that the extension is still in force.
We ask merely for the 24 hours.
Granted.
We need to talk about the Bishop case.
Oh. We'll have all the motions ready well before...
I already revised this bill. I cut the hours.
You cut your hours.
You were instructed to cut the associates' hours.
I thought we were trying to keep the bill down.
Does it make a difference where the hours come from?
A considerable one.
Clients like to see partner hours.
It reassures them.
A disproportionate number of associate hours
leaves them to wonder whether their case is still a priority.
The associates are the ones doing all the heavy lifting.
It doesn't seem right to penalize them.
They'll find other opportunities to make up the hours.
You're management now, Alicia.
You're not an associate-- stop pretending that you are.
Will the other associates grumble about you? Yes.
But if you pretend you're still their peer,
they will grumble all the more, and they will come to hate you.
This is not the Queen's Hamlet.
You cannot dress up as a peasant here.
So stop it.
It is galling to them,
and it is galling to me.
Did Saint Alicia sign off on the brief?
I didn't get a chance to show it to her.
She's in with Diane.
Any idea what they were talking about?
Probably other ways to shaft us.
She's been the golden girl since the day she got here.
Yeah, well, life lesson: be nicer to her,
so she doesn't cut our hours on the next case.
Hi. Everything good in here?
Yeah. Just plowing away on the Bishop case.
Good. Don't let up.
By the way, the issue with the bill has been resolved.
Alicia cut her own hours instead of yours.
But keep up the good work.
All right, we're live in 20 minutes.
Wrong side.
I believe your group is going to be watching from the other wing.
Thank you.
It's not going to work, you know.
What's that?
Jordan...
sent you over here to unsettle me before the debate.
It's not going to.
You know, they're always wondering
if men and women can really be friends.
But the real question is:
Can women?
I mean, there's no question that immigration is a complex issue.
But let me just say this--
we are Illinois, not Arizona.
Thank you, Mr. States Attorney.
Oh, I'm sorry. I think, according to your... pre-agreed rules,
I'm supposed to refer to you as Mr. Florrick.
That's all right, Petra.
I won't hold it against you.
Thank you.
And I'll let you call me... Petra.
Now, let's see. Ms. Hayward, do you have any response?
I do.
I am thrilled that the State's Attorney
has found the Latino vote.
Our state is only 16% Hispanic,
and yet of the nearly 10,000 inmates of Cook County Prison,
which you oversee, 36% are Hispanic.
She's really going after him.
Oh, he's doing fine.
Well, those statistics tell a very frightening story
if you live in Mr. Florrick's county
and your skin is not white.
How many of the lawyers
working under you are African-American, Mr. Florrick?
Less than five percent.
Yes, and that is a problem which we are addressing...
You were told about this lack of diversity
in a staff memo two years ago,
and you've done nothing.
Thank you. Ms. Hayward...
How did she know that?
From me. She's using it.
...the question we were addressing was immigration?
I thought we were encouraging a free range of topics here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everyone.
Mr. Florrick, would you like to respond to Miss Hayward
on the issue of preferential hiring?
No, thank you.
Come on, Peter.
We have just one more witness, Your Honor.
Good to hear, Counselor.
We call Josh Perrotti.
We object to this witness, Your Honor.
Strenuously.
The defamatory comments that Frank Landau made about my client--
they were made to AUSA Perrotti.
His testimony is more than relevant.
Your Honor, the always-creative Ms. Tascioni
is using this suit to obstruct my federal case.
Which is not my problem, Mr. Perrotti.
Here you're a private citizen
who's out of order in my court.
The witness sounds perfectly relevant to this case.
Mr. Perrotti, come get a view from the front.
Enunciate. I want to make sure he hears you.
Oh, he will.
I will fight for you.
That's what your vote means to me.
If you want someone who's polite and calm, vote for Peter,
but if you want a fighter, vote for me.
Thank you, Maddie.
Well, that brings us to our halfway point.
We'll take a short break now.
This is the Illinois Democratic gubernatorial debate.
And we'll be right back.
Oh, she's trying to bait you.
You stick with the plan, we'll be okay.
Hmm. How am I doing?
Mostly good.
That's all we need is mostly good.
Tell me the truth.
I don't know strategy, but you need to call Eli.
How much time do I have?
Hey, Peter?
Three minutes.
Peter? Peter, we need to talk.
Jordan, I actually have to ask you a question.
But isn't it true, Mr. Perrotti...?
You can call me Josh.
But isn't it true, Mr. Perrotti, that you failed
to objectively prove this vote-purchasing charge in federal court?
For the moment.
Time is irrelevant here, isn't it?
You either prove this...
How bad?
Oh, well, clearly, she's treating this debate
like it's a game changer.
Jordan wants me to stick to policy and not push back.
Ugh! You can't play rope-a-dope, Peter.
You bland out when you don't punch.
Back in two minutes, everyone.
And don't let her near you.
My guess is, she got the advice
that she should stand near you when you start bullying.
Don't let her.
Well, I can't have her chasing me around the stage.
Just be aware of the camera frame. There are three cameras.
Keep her from getting in the frame with you.
How do I do that?
Walk the outskirts of the arena,
closest to the bleachers.
The cameras can't get cross-angles.
Sure...
Okay?
Your three minutes are up?
Yeah.
I forgot how good you are at this.
Thank you.
I really miss having you run the show, Eli.
You can't prove the federal charges against Eli Gold...
I know.
Yeah, I... I miss you, too.
Okay. Good luck.
Yeah. You, too.
...can't prove it at this moment?
Correct.
And isn't it true that Frank Landau
was disqualified as a coconspirator?
Well, in the judge's opinion, yes,
but that doesn't make it any less true.
Really? How is that?
The federal court has decided...
No, it hasn't decided.
It has left the question open.
Until you bring in another coconspirator?
Yes.
And have you found another coconspirator?
Again, Your Honor, this testimony is being used
purely to shake me down.
That's awful.
Please answer.
Yes, I have found another coconspirator.
And who is that?
Mr. Perrotti. Josh?
I'm afraid you need to cough up the name,
or be held in contempt.
Who is the new coconspirator?
Diane Lockhart.
Simply put, Mr. Florrick has spent
the last dozen years being a politician.
I've spent them building and running a company.
Thank you, Maddie.
And thank you for staying within your time limit.
Mr. Florrick, do you have anything here?
Would you like to pass?
Mr. Florrick, you can
bank your time if you like.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Mr. Florrick?
Um, you know, you... you talk about creating jobs, ma'am,
but isn't it true that recently
you closed your company's semiconductor plant
in Schaumburg and shipped 1,200 jobs to Mexico?
We also opened a distributing center in Aurora,
creating 1,000 new jobs.
60% of which are part-time and don't see benefits.
I don't think that's exactly true.
Oh, what is true
62.5, to be exact.
Added to the 30% of your employees recently furloughed...
What's he doing?
He's trying to win.
They were furloughed because the economy was hit.
Now that the economy is coming back...
You'll try to union-bust them.
Excuse me.
Last month, in a conference call with Wall Street analysts,
didn't you say that within five years,
you would drive the unions from your plants?
I did not... That is not what I said.
That is not what I said. I said... I said,
union costs, union demands,
were increasing costs and making it difficult to be competitive.
Uh, so it's okay to cut your employees' wages
while you renovate your summer home on Lake Geneva?
Peter, I believe the audience member
asked a question about over-regulation, not... me.
Yes, but I believe we're encouraging a free range of topics here.
Diane Lockhart,
senior partner at Lockhart-Gardner.
Ms. Lockhart, this is a Lockhart-Gardner invoice
to Greengate Retirement Centers.
It includes a 25% discount for Eli Gold's
crisis management services.
Would you please read the handwritten initials at the bottom?
D.L.
You initialed this invoice?
Yes. Will Gardner or I sign off on every bill
before it is sent to a client.
Your Honor, Ms. Lockhart conspired with Eli Gold
to offer Greengate services at a discount.
She's the coconspirator.
Your Honor, that is a stretch.
Not at all.
There are two ways to show conspiracy--
the agreement of services received,
and the agreement of services offered.
This is for services offered.
We would agree. Ms. Lockhart,
did you approve Eli Gold's
25% discount to Greengate?
No.
You just testified you initialed this invoice.
Yes, but I didn't approve it.
I only signed off on it because
my supervisor instructed me to.
I'm sorry. Aren't you and Will Gardner the bosses?
When this invoice came due, our firm was in bankruptcy.
We were under the control of a court-appointed trustee,
Mr. Clarke Hayden. He was the one in charge.
He was eager to boost cash flow and
had us offer clients discounts for quicker payment.
If Ms. Lockhart did not approve that discount,
it rules her out as a coconspirator, Your Honor.
No, the charge still stands.
It will be amended to reflect Lockhart-Gardner
as the coconspirator...
Yes, but the trustee, Mr. Hayden,
was an employee of the creditors, not Lockhart-Gardner.
Isn't that right, Ms. Lockhart?
It is.
So, Mr. Perrotti, are you going to continue
to play musical coconspirators,
or are we done here?
Well done.
Thank you.
Do you like the ballet?
No.
Me, neither. Let's not go together.
Dinner?
No.
May I ask why?
No.
You did right by us on those hours.
Thank you.
Do I want to know the names I was called?
Let's just say,
some of your fairy tale favorites got some play.
Well, you might want to break 'em out again.
My notes are in the margins.
Don't worry about the preamble.
I thought we were set.
We were.
I'll need the revised brief tomorrow.
No later than 10:00.
Polling says that 56% of the viewers think
that I won the debate.
It's probably a couple of points higher.
They always under-sample younger voters.
No landlines.
You're still packing.
I'm still damaged goods.
Well, I want you back.
Kresteva will use this.
Ugh! Kresteva will use anything and everything.
You can't be sentimental, Peter.
You think that's sentimental?
How about this?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, are you gonna stay?
Because I don't see myself
getting to Springfield without you.
Or Washington?
Or Washington.
Okay, I'll stay.
Good. Now, unpack all that crap, and let's get to work.
