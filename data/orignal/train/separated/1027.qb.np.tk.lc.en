vincent adler --
he &apos;s looking for a sunken u @-@ boat off the new york coast .
i just want to say that if we &apos;re gonna continue working together ,
then we really should not ignore the other night .
look , it was -- - hot .
the chrysler building . painting it for your girlfriend ?
it calms the nerves .
my god .
you found it .
it &apos;s nazi plunder ...
from all over europe .
this has got to be worth billions of dollars .
get down !
you did this .
peter , those were masterpieces .
i would never burn them . you know that .
but you &apos;d steal them .
then prove it .
你会感谢我的
we &apos;ve got to hurry .
we &apos;re almost loaded .
it &apos;s the feds . let &apos;s get out of here .
get around the front of that plane .
team one , flank left .
team three , flank right . box him in !
we cannot let caffrey get airborne !
we &apos;re not gonna make it .
we don &apos;t have a choice , moz .
we have to make it .
what color are your eyes ?
blue .
are you a criminal consultant
for the federal bureau of investigation ?
yes .
okay .
for a baseline , i &apos;m gonna need you to tell a lie .
i &apos;ve never told a lie .
great . we &apos;ve got our baseline .
ask him about the warehouse .
shortly before his death ,
you confronted vincent adler outside of a warehouse .
what was in that warehouse ?
a u @-@ boat -- german ,
recently dredged off the coast of new york state .
and inside of that u @-@ boat ?
a collection of art plundered by the nazis .
what happened ?
the warehouse burst into flames .
did you steal the art ?
no .
do you know who did ?
no .
according to the readout , he &apos;s telling the truth .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the morning , peter .
you gonna keep me here all night ?
until i &apos;m satisfied .
next question .
you look exhausted .
everything okay ?
oh , just -- long night .
sara , peter may come to you
and ask some questions .
about what ?
he thinks the art didn &apos;t burn .
how &apos;s that possible ?
oh , he thinks you took it .
i was off @-@ anklet when it could have happened .
so you need an alibi .
what is it you &apos;re hoping i tell him ?
the truth .
about the other night .
you want me to tell him everything ?
&apos;cause that could get really very awkward .
skip the good parts .
yeah .
did you take it ?
no .
do you believe me ?
you &apos;re a damn good con man .
caffrey ...
if that art is out there ...
any idea who has it ?
her name is lolana .
she from any island in particular ?
whichever one your heart desires .
so , i guess this was from you ?
how ?
it wasn &apos;t easy .
the warehouse ?
i worked backwards
from the transmitter you wired into the limo .
security ?
i got around it with a localized e.m. burst .
and the art ?
adler had it loaded onto a truck .
the swap wasn &apos;t hard .
and the tnt we got off the sub
was unstable and easy to detonate .
a perfect cover .
you didn &apos;t tell me .
plausible deniability and all .
we finally got our white whale .
lolana , huh ?
in hawaiian , her name means &quot; to soar ... &quot;
which is exactly what we &apos;re gonna do in a very short time .
well , it &apos;s not that easy .
i just spent five hours in interrogation with peter .
he suspects something .
all the more reason for haste .
how long to get things ready ?
just a few days .
i can lull peter .
but we don &apos;t rush this .
we take our time . we do it right .
to our best and final score .
i passed you lie @-@ detector .
i &apos;ve seen you do that before .
are you saying i cheated ?
i &apos;ve seen you do that before .
all right , if you &apos;re not gonna talk to me ,
let &apos;s at least just keep it civil , okay ?
fine . how bout them mets ?
what &apos;s wrong ? hmm ?
what happened that turned you against me ?
i turned against you ?
peter , we &apos;re a team .
we did this .
this is our job .
let &apos;s not make a big deal out of it .
you &apos;re smiling .
i am .
tell me about gary rydell .
that &apos;s you .
yeah , it is .
regale me .
oh , it was an alias i used years ago .
rydell was a bit of a playboy
with an uncanny ability to wreck expensive cars .
of course . anything else ?
he was a world @-@ class fencer .
and ?
neal , i &apos;ve read the file .
and a smuggler .
a world @-@ class smuggler .
yeah , i get it .
you think i might activate my rydell alias
in order to sneak something out of the country ,
something like a stolen nazi treasure ?
crossed my mind .
i think this guy is looking for rydell .
i want to know why .
david lawrence .
you know him .
yeah . we met a few years ago .
he was selling pre @-@ columbian art ,
and i was--
buying .
yeah , buying .
lawrence was also suspected of
robbing $ 60 million from the federal reserve .
he fled the country on a commercial jet
before we could make the arrest .
we think he left the $ 60 mil behind .
well , safe assumption .
i mean , the baggage fees alone would &apos;ve cost a fortune .
two days ago ,
we traced an e @-@ mail he sent to a server here in new york .
lawrence wants you
to help him smuggle the cash out of the country .
you want me to strike up a deal with him
and lead you to the $ 60 million .
we &apos;ll let you know when we make contact .
uh , you really think he &apos;s gonna take this risk ?
if you were one step away
from pulling off the biggest score in your life ...
could you let it go ?
peter &apos;s not playing a hunch .
he knows something .
impossible .
he &apos;s breathing down my neck .
he &apos;s messing with your head . that &apos;s what suits do .
so , there &apos;s nothing from the heist
that could be tied back to me ?
moz .
you know that art studio
where you keep all the paintings you &apos;ve done ?
what about it ?
now it &apos;s just a studio .
you switched my art for the art on the sub ?
neal , you &apos;re talented , but van dyck has you beat .
i can &apos;t believe it .
look , they ran forensics tests on the burned warehouse .
they needed to find traces of paint and canvas .
do you know what this means ?
nothing could survive that fire .
nothing should have survived the fire .
thank you .
honey , you &apos;ve been staring at that all night .
he took it , el .
i know he took the art .
i &apos;m standing there ,
watching the warehouse go up in flames ,
and this floats down at my feet .
it &apos;s a piece of the same painting
that was in his apartment .
you &apos;re positive it &apos;s the same ?
how many paintings like this
could there be of the chrysler building ?
actually , you &apos;d be surprised . art deco started in paris ,
so there was a lot of european interest in the chrysler .
yeah , here .
it &apos;s been around , what , 80 years ?
here it is .
&quot; countless artists would interpret the chrysler &apos;s majesty
using a variety of styles and techniques . &quot;
it was built in 1931 .
could &apos;ve been on the sub .
or maybe neal painted it .
or maybe you &apos;ve been chasing him for so long ,
you don &apos;t know how to stop .
or maybe i know him better than anyone else .
if not him , then mozzie or alex .
neal &apos;s involved-- somehow .
well , there &apos;s a way you can find out .
have the forensics team test it .
if it &apos;s from the 1930s , then you know it &apos;s not his .
i can &apos;t involve the bureau-- not yet .
if i &apos;m right ...
and neal &apos;s behind this ...
he goes down .
and so do i.
i could have it tested .
you have a lab in the basement i don &apos;t know about ?
no , the dearmitt gallery .
they go through private labs to authenticate work .
it &apos;s been years since you worked there .
i keep in touch .
you could call in a favor ?
for you ?
anything .
we made contact with lawrence
through your rydell e @-@ mail account .
he wants to meet you at the gramercy fencing club
in a few hours .
why can &apos;t guys like you ever just grab a beer ?
imported or domestic ?
just meet with him , lead us back to the cash .
i &apos;m pulling your anklet .
as usual .
don &apos;t get cocky . we &apos;ll be listening .
and i &apos;ll be close .
thank you .
david .
good to see you again .
it is good to be seen , gary .
you know , i missed this place .
beauty here--
they encourage disguises .
who are you hiding from ?
you never can be too careful .
is that why i haven &apos;t seen you in the last six years ?
oh , i retired to the islands .
my friend , if you &apos;re retired ...
then why aren &apos;t we playing shuffleboard ?
i haven &apos;t heard of you in the last six years , either , gary .
how do i know you &apos;re still on your game ?
maybe i &apos;m that good .
or maybe you lost a step .
that was my tie .
come on . show me you &apos;re still as good as
the gary rydell i used to know .
well , i &apos;m still using a french grip ...
... still a fan of the depassement attaque .
let &apos;s get to the point-- you stole $ 60 million
but couldn &apos;t get it out of the country .
now you need me to move it for you .
tell me i &apos;m wrong .
nice attaque composé .
feint left , thrust right-- my signature .
i remember .
get me and the green out of the country ,
and you will earn 10 % .
20 % .
well , i &apos;m in no position to argue .
where &apos;s the cash ?
close .
set it up . i &apos;ll be in touch .
it is cruel and unusual punishment
for you to bring me back here like this .
yes , but i &apos;m finally smiling .
what &apos;s your plan for moving lawrence &apos;s money ?
i &apos;ll take it out by boat .
why a boat ?
one , we &apos;re talking about a large shipment
that &apos;s easier to move on the water than by air .
and , two , it &apos;s easier to pay off dock workers
than tsa employees .
sold .
diana , i want a team at the harbor .
you got it .
blue .
i &apos;ve driven you to dumpster dive ?
a souvenir of neal caffrey &apos;s imperfect moment ?
priceless .
you shouldn &apos;t have !
grandma insisted .
oh , you &apos;re both so thoughtful !
mozzie , you , of course ,
know june &apos;s beautiful granddaughter .
oh . hi , cindy .
grandma said the two of you
have been , uh , up to something in here .
oh , you know , idle hands and all .
and they brought us coffee !
oh , and cookies !
i &apos;ll be back for the tray .
no . no , no . don &apos;t trouble yourself .
yeah . we &apos;ll bring it down .
everything looks beautiful .
thanks again for everything .
thank you .
lovely girl .
i &apos;m gonna miss this place .
yeah , and the views .
yeah .
all right . peter &apos;s team is setting up a harbor sting .
oh , well , perfect .
so while the fbi is busy collaring lawrence by sea ,
we &apos;ll be making our escape par avion ...
by air .
i have procured our getaway vehicle .
voila . behold --
the 400 series twin otter .
is it big enough ?
think of it as a kardashian --
what it lacks in refinement ,
it makes up for in cargo space .
you &apos;re not sold .
no , the plane &apos;s great .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m worried about peter .
he &apos;s holding something , moz .
if he &apos;s got a card he hasn &apos;t played yet ,
we &apos;re not gonna get far .
okay . so , what &apos;s the best way
to find out what peter knows ?
hey , neal .
hey .
peter &apos;s not here .
i know .
i want to see you .
i was hoping we could talk .
come on in .
thank you .
you , um ... want some coffee ?
i never say no to good coffee .
huh . okay .
well , then , why don &apos;t i pour ,
and you tell me why you dropped by
knowing my husband &apos;s not here ?
i don &apos;t know .
he suddenly doesn &apos;t trust me .
i don &apos;t know how sudden it is .
i don &apos;t know -- breaking out of prison ,
stealing the music box , almost shooting fowler .
you want me to go on ?
not particularly , no .
look , he wants to trust you ,
but you have this -- i don &apos;t know -- habit
of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m impulsive but i have a good heart ?
maybe you can try and balance the two ?
you make a fair point .
and a great cup of coffee .
but i like a little bit of milk in mine .
yes .
tell me when .
when .
to the right things ...
for the right reasons .
picked up a copy on the way home .
and you &apos;re sure mrs. suit
was intentionally hiding it from you ?
yes .
you know , i guess a part of me always knew
when push comes to shove , she &apos;d choose peter .
well , he &apos;s her husband .
yeah , have they ever swapped ossobuco recipes ?
which apparently means nothing .
wait a minute .
this has to be it .
the chrysler building ?
yeah , peter was here the night before the fire .
this painting was on that easel . he commented on it .
you remember ?
did you put it on the sub ?
you know , in all honesty ,
i @-@ it wasn &apos;t one of your better works .
what if it didn &apos;t burn , moz ?
if he had it , you &apos;d be in cuffs already .
no . i know him . he &apos;d want to be sure .
so he gave it to the feds to run some tests
to see if the painting predated the sub
as opposed to , say , last week .
if the bureau ran the tests ,
he &apos;d have the results by now .
he doesn &apos;t want the fbi involved .
he doesn &apos;t want it on the record .
why not ?
to protect me .
or to protect himself .
maybe .
so , if he didn &apos;t give it to the fbi lab ,
who else could test it ?
elizabeth ?
elizabeth ?
yeah , she comes from an art background ,
and she knows about the painting .
i should keep an eye on her .
it &apos;s worth a shot , haversham .
beautiful day , gary .
yes , it is .
i was wondering if you &apos;d show .
i didn &apos;t come this far to back out now .
i wasn &apos;t ruling it out .
every day that money sits there , just out of reach .
comes a point where you finish the job or it finishes you .
you get caught , you lose everything .
already lost everything .
when i ran , i ran fast . didn &apos;t look back .
so ...
how &apos;s this gonna work ?
on your go , the ingenieur minard
will provide you and your cargo
a safe and discrete passage to the island of santo antao .
all the documentation you may need upon arrival
is in that envelope ,
i.d. , passport , everything .
getting in isn &apos;t my concern . it &apos;s getting out .
four steps .
step one , we move your money here by truck .
step two , my inside man at the gate ,
mr.ryan in customs ,
looks the other way ,
while we transport you and your cargo to the vessel .
step four , mr.ryan files faux routing papers .
anyone comes looking for you ,
they &apos;ll start their search in calais , france ,
4,000 miles from your actual location .
not bad . but you skipped step three .
step three is the reason you hired me .
handle your end . trust me to handle mine .
caffrey &apos;s pretty savvy at planning an escape .
yeah . until lawrence makes his move ,
he knows we &apos;ll keep his anklet off .
you &apos;re gonna let him walk around unmonitored ?
no .
you are to check in every two hours on the hour .
you go from home to the office , and that &apos;s it .
i know the drill .
you &apos;re not off anklet for good behavior .
after lawrence gets you to his money ,
take him to the harbor .
we &apos;ve been over this . anything else ?
yeah . what &apos;s step three ?
step three is you arrest him .
oh . good thing you didn &apos;t tell him .
i thought you might like that .
heard you talked to el .
look , peter , whatever you think i have done ,
you and me -- hey .
we &apos;re on the same team .
really ?
yes .
may i ?
yes . get out !
thank you .
talk to you in two hours .
and two hours after that .
that &apos;s what i like to hear .
hey , moz .
our hunch may be correct .
mrs. suit is chatting up her old boss
at the dearmitt gallery .
what &apos;d she say ?
&quot; oh , what a spring we &apos;re having . &quot;
oh , she &apos;s asking him about a lab test .
oh ! s @-@ she &apos;s giving him a scrap of burnt painting .
is it mine ?
oh , sweet elvis costello !
it &apos;s your chrysler painting !
it didn &apos;t burn .
flame is a fickle mistress .
we &apos;re gonna have to steal it .
no . no , no , no , no .
peter will suspect me .
let them run the tests . we &apos;ll swap it out .
risky but not impossible .
we need a swatch of canvas and some paints from the 1930s .
which we have in great supply .
all right . meet me at the warehouse . i &apos;m on my way .
where are you ?
i &apos;ve got a tail .
what ? !
have you started ?
of course i started ,
but without you here ,
i &apos;m not sure which colors to sample ,
so this whole thing might be an exercise in futility .
just pull the primaries . i can mix the rest .
i &apos;m not an idiot .
i scraped a titanium white from the rembrandt ,
a midnight blue from a vlaminck .
oh , you should get a monestial blue .
you know , i should get a monestial blue .
if you find one thick enough ,
feel free to let me know .
oh , that &apos;s right -- you &apos;re not here !
breathe , moz .
how are we doing on the canvas ? did you check the dali ?
evidently ...
our friend salvador liked to stretch time
but not canvases .
i &apos;ll find something .
i know you will .
practicing ?
yeah , i figured i should have a copy of the chrysler
lying around in case peter came looking for it .
you get everything ?
some canvas and a spectrum of prewar paint
that would pass any wood &apos;s light or i.r. spectroscopy ,
they want to throw at it .
the red is from a portrait of fernande olivier .
the last person to mix this paint was picasso .
we &apos;re taking from masters .
oh , picasso was a communist . he &apos;d be happy to share .
what &apos;s the plan for the gallery ?
ah ! the plan for the gallery .
i pried some information from
a loose @-@ lipped gallerista .
they &apos;re sending our swatch out to an authentication lab .
at 11 : 00 a.m. tomorrow morning .
the gallery opens at 10 : 30,
so we have 30 minutes to get inside ,
make the switch , then get out .
it &apos;s gonna be close . security ?
a standard schlagel on the door ,
with surveillance cameras .
we &apos;ll need a distraction while i pick it .
i can &apos;t buy you that much time by myself .
how about a kansas city mud slide ?
you gonna work the jackhammer ?
no .
let &apos;s run a phoebe cates .
who &apos;s the girl ?
i don &apos;t think june would mind if we used her granddaughter .
well , she &apos;s pretty enough .
will she do it without asking questions ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s up for a little excitement .
excellent !
oh -- now on to the bigger question .
how do you plan on losing your tail ,
outside evolution ?
i &apos;ll take a page from magritte .
ah , you got to be kidding me .
caffrey !
did i win ?
the contest -- &quot; wear a dark suit , fedora ,
come to 23rd and 10th .
best @-@ dressed wins 500 bucks . &quot;
you won !
okay , moz . you &apos;re up .
hey , i have a delivery for a thomas johnson .
you just missed him . tom took a job in boston .
his last day was monday .
oh , damn . can &apos;t blame him , though .
boston &apos;s a hell of a town .
something i can help you with ?
no , i &apos;m just admiring the view .
nice , huh ?
yeah .
look what i did . i got it all over me .
there is something very seriously wrong with me .
today of all days . would you mind holding this ?
oh . uh , sure .
and could you take this ?
o @-@ okay , but --
and i &apos;m gonna need you to hold this up for me .
oh . of course .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! miss ! you can &apos;t take your top off here .
look , i don &apos;t think you get it .
i can &apos;t be late today , okay ?
my boss will kill me if i &apos;m late .
c @-@ come on , man . let her change !
yeah . i guess it couldn &apos;t hurt .
uh , just be quick about it , okay ?
thanks , guys , really .
you have no idea what this means to me .
oh , or ... us .
which top do you like ?
this or this ?
uh , th @-@ the second one .
you guys are wonderful .
yeah , just a couple of working stiffs
doing what we can to help out a lady in distress .
almost there .
perfect . we are good to go .
great .
you are a lifesaver .
you too .
screw boston .
this is a hell of a town .
hey , peter .
you gave jones a nice runaround .
that was jones ? i thought that could &apos;ve been lawrence .
i didn &apos;t want to blow my cover .
why &apos;d you put jones on me ?
you really want me to answer that ? you at home ?
where else would i be ?
what are you doing ?
you know , arts and crafts -- the usual .
jones will be at your place in 20 minutes .
he &apos;s gonna stay on you . you &apos;re gonna let him .
no problem .
bye .
so , i &apos;m getting everything in place at the warehouse .
the plane is fueled and ready .
you know jones is outside , right ?
yeah . once i get lawrence and his money to the docks ,
i can slip him again .
by the time lawrence is being hauled downtown ,
we &apos;ll be sipping champagne at cruising altitude .
so , when &apos;s &quot; go &quot; time ?
lawrence &apos;s text came in two minutes ago .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
this is it !
we take our time . we do it right .
look , you know ,
everything good must one day come to an end .
just think --
we &apos;re never gonna see anything in this apartment again --
except you . you can come with me .
hey . what are you doing ?
this is our final curtain call ,
our big au revoir .
i should say something to june .
hey . you know the rules . no goodbyes .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna miss her , too .
i &apos;m gonna miss all of it .
come on .
i &apos;ll see you downstairs .
okay .
goodbye , caffrey .
lawrence made contact ?
i &apos;m on my way to the fencing club
to meet him now .
update me when you have the money .
jones will back your play if anything goes wrong .
i &apos;m heading to the harbor now .
all right .
everything in place ?
only thing left is the money .
the federal reserve job -- it was flawless .
probably the most secure vault in the world ,
and i walked out with $ 60 million .
it was prometheus ...
stealing fire from the gods .
prometheus got caught .
yes , he did .
yes , he did .
and the fbi closed in -- fast .
every account , p.o. box , storage locker ,
friends , relatives , apartments .
they were all over me .
i needed to get out fast , stash the money .
i thought i &apos;d be back in 48 hours to collect it ,
but the feds were there , waiting .
instead , i was on a plane headed south of the border .
every morning , i &apos;d check the news ,
waiting to hear the report --
&quot; $ 60 million found in gramercy fencing club . &quot;
it &apos;s here ?
there are five ducts to this room .
i diverted air to two of them .
there it is --
$ 60 million .
you know how many times i pictured this in my head ?
is this how you thought it &apos;d feel ?
no .
better .
what &apos;s going on ?
someone knows we &apos;re here .
agent jones .
fbi .
what are you doing here ?
talk , or i shoot .
you tailing my friend here ?
answer him .
were you following me ?
i don &apos;t know who you are .
i &apos;m on lawrence .
how many your friends you got out there ?
i followed a hunch .
i &apos;m by myself .
pack of wolves !
they probably know about the dock .
the whole thing is blown .
kill him . dump the body .
w @-@ w @-@ wait a second .
this guy is useless dead .
alive , he &apos;s leverage .
for what ?
you forgot step three .
attaque compose -- feint left , thrust right .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about a backup plan .
when it all goes to hell , this is why you hire me .
i &apos;ve got a plane .
now boarding --
freedom airlines , flight number one and only .
i &apos;m here with the client .
we &apos;re putting step three into effect .
step three ? neal , what are you talking about ?
the client and i are moving the cargo to the airstrip .
client ?
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re talking about lawrence .
that &apos;s right .
no . no , no , no .
don &apos;t do this to us .
make sure it &apos;s gassed up and good to go . all right ?
grab your suit and meet me there .
what ? no suits . no suits on the island !
neal --
no sign of caffrey and lawrence .
still no answer from jones .
this is taking way too long .
you better have a good reason for calling .
i &apos;m in the middle of something very important , mozzie .
yeah , you and me both , suit .
i &apos;m passing on a message from neal .
he &apos;s made a request for our presence ,
without the slightest regard
for the monumental inconvenience it causes us --
primarily , me .
van buren airstrip . 30 minutes .
moving out .
neal , we got to hurry .
i said , &quot; suit , &quot; not &quot; costume . &quot;
don &apos;t worry . the suit got the message .
load the fed up front .
jones ?
why aren &apos;t we flying ?
you sure you can fly this thing ?
get around the front of that plane .
team one , flank left .
team three , flank right . box him in !
we cannot let caffrey get airborne !
lolana , it wasn &apos;t supposed to be like this .
get us out of here .
we &apos;re not gonna make it .
we don &apos;t have a choice , moz .
we have to make it .
climb .
we need more speed .
climb now !
watch out !
fbi !
come out now with your hands up !
let me see your hands !
we &apos;re secure !
lawrence is on the plane !
you okay ?
i &apos;m good .
you all right , jones ?
yeah .
caffrey had my back .
your timing is far from impeccable , j. edgar .
sorry ... amelia .
luckily , i was here to save the day once again .
you &apos;re a hero , moz . i &apos;ll sew you a cape .
do that . i look good in aubergine .
thank you .
step three , huh ?
the part where you arrest him .
nice work .
thanks .
ah , the anklet .
