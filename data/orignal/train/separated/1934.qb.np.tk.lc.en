&quot; risk &quot;
nobody &apos;s memory is perfect or complete .
we jumble things up .
richard .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
we lose track of time .
richard !
we are in one place ...
you believe that your career is more important than mine .
it is ! ... - then another .
i gave it up for you .
i don &apos;t want it .
and it all feels like one long , inescapable moment .
i raised you to be an extraordinary human being .
so imagine my disappointment when i wake up after five years
and discover that you &apos;re no more than ordinary .
it &apos;s just like my mother used to say --
the carousel never stops turning .
you asked for a consult . this is my advice .
that &apos;s not the point .
i have to control the infection . surgery first .
she has an abscess of her brain ventricle .
if i don &apos;t operate , she will die of sepsis .
if it ruptures , she won &apos;t sur--
let &apos;s have one conversation here !
meredith , what do you need ?
pierce paged me .
yeah , i need a general consult on her chest .
what about webber ?
i paged dr. grey .
pierce , make your case .
i respect dr. shepherd &apos;s opinion ,
but i need to go in first to debride the infection
before it shuts down her heart ,
her lungs , all of her organs .
and she is my patient . i paged you for a consult .
i &apos;m sorry , but if the ventricle ruptures ,
it could be catastrophic .
i can &apos;t sit back and let that happen .
if you go in first , she will die on your table .
if you do , she could come out a brain @-@ dead patient .
owen , will you look at the scans ?
the abscess is up against the ventricle .
it could cause significant brain edema and severe meningitis .
so , basically , you &apos;re both racing the clock on this girl .
if the time hasn &apos;t run out already .
we &apos;ll know if her heart stops .
grey , what do you think ?
i agree with pierce .
i think we get to the neck and the mediastinum first .
look at the head c.t.
i did . i still think pierce is right .
no , no , no , let me show you .
i know how to read a brain scan , derek .
i learned from the best , remember ?
all right , enough . i know what we &apos;re gonna do .
let &apos;s go and talk to the patient .
i had had a root canal .
last week , and it &apos;s hurt for like a week .
but i figured , it &apos;s a root canal .
it &apos;s supposed to hurt , right ?
yeah , well , you should have told me .
anyway , she passed out at work yesterday ,
and she &apos;s run a fever ever since .
holly , you got an infection from the dental procedure
called descending necrotizing mediastinitis .
it spread quickly into your neck and down into your mediastinum ,
which is the space between your lungs that houses your heart .
and the fever is caused from the sepsis from the infection .
holly , in addition the sepsis , i found a lesion in your brain ,
and i think we should start there first .
are you telling me that my daughter needs brain surgery ?
yes , immediately . she needs chest debridement
as soon as possible .
what are you saying ?
here is what we &apos;re going to do .
you &apos;ve not responded to the i.v. antibiotics ,
so i would like to run a chest c.t. with contrast
to determine which infection is most urgent .
we will have a decision very soon , okay ?
edwards ?
hi .
what are you doing here ?
i am interested in fetal surgery ,
and dr. webber said that i could do some o.b. ultrasounds , so ...
so , you &apos;re doing my ultrasound ?
unless you don &apos;t want me to .
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine .
you got to learn ...
on me .
i mean , it &apos;s fine with me either way .
no , it &apos;s all good .
we don &apos;t want to know the sex , so i &apos;m not gonna look .
i will do all of the looking .
all right , so , there are the feet and the toes .
he &apos;s breech ,
sitting cross @-@ legged like a little buddha .
yeah , he does that .
oh , my god .
what ?
you said &quot; he . &quot;
no , i didn &apos;t .
yeah , you did .
you said &quot; he . &quot;
no .
you said &quot; he . &quot;
oh . oh , oh , god .
i just said i didn &apos;t want to know the sex !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . it was a rookie mistake .
how &apos;s it looking in h--
stephanie .
why ... ?
i &apos;m practicing .
okay . yeah .
yeah .
all right , just don &apos;t let her know the sex .
oh , no .
no , she says the baby &apos;s sitting like a little buddha ,
just like last time .
last time ?
hey , there , little ... thing , you .
all right , well , i got surgeries most of the day ,
so i &apos;m gonna miss our lunch . sorry .
torres might get one of our guys back up on his feet today ,
20周 23周
and i &apos;m gonna miss that , too .
but , yay , you guys . good luck .
all right .
and i just lied to my husband .
that &apos;s a great way to start parenthood -- lying .
awesome . thanks , edwards .
i &apos;m really sorry , but we &apos;re not done .
oh , we &apos;re done .
whoa , rick , you &apos;re pulling way ahead .
all right , you got to do better than that , jordan ,
if you want to beat rick &apos;s numbers .
oh , well , have we started ?
see , i thought this was still the warm @-@ up .
oh ! gloves are off .
you don &apos;t want a tie , right , guys ?
don &apos;t get his hopes up , dr. &quot; t. &quot; he can &apos;t touch my scores .
oh , bite me . i &apos;m getting up on that leg first .
you gonna take that ?
what was it you said my scores were earlier ?
&quot; phenomenal . &quot;
guys , you &apos;re doing fine .
you &apos;re both gonna get the leg eventually .
this is not a contest .
where &apos;s the fun in that , sir ?
yeah .
you &apos;re pitting these guys against each other ?
i just spent the morning refereeing the surgeons .
i don &apos;t need this . this is not a good idea .
they came up with this .
the one to master the virtual @-@ reality leg first
gets to try the real leg first .
it &apos;s just a little friendly competition .
i &apos;m just saying , don &apos;t push them .
hey , we are this close , owen .
we &apos;re gonna have someone walking today .
yes !
smoked you , schultz !
congrats , man .
see , that &apos;s the thing about soldiers , hunt .
i don &apos;t have to push them . they come wired that way .
all right , carter , you ready to take a walk ?
it &apos;s a pretty straightforward procedure .
i &apos;ll do the initial approach . robbins , you can do the cutting .
god , this is good .
did you ever try this -- banana clambake ?
i haven &apos;t , and certainly not before 8 : 00 a.m.
does it have actual clams ?
you &apos;re very perky today .
why not ? life is short . and at this point ,
i can eat whatever the hell i want for breakfast .
right , robbins ?
right . you &apos;ve earned it .
i just wish i could do that and stay as trim as you do .
shut up , graham .
i &apos;ll finish prep . see you in there .
god , that was worth it .
i &apos;m trying to get through every flavor they have
before i cash in .
please don &apos;t say that .
why ? why be so serious ?
because we &apos;re about to operate on a pregnant woman ,
and i have no idea if you &apos;re in any condition --
i told you -- - you told me nothing !
you told me you have a brain tumor .
i don &apos;t know anything else about you .
i don &apos;t know -- i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re married .
that &apos;s not the deal . you get access to my knowledge .
it doesn &apos;t give you access to my life .
i &apos;m talking about next of kin .
like if something should happen to you , who do i call ?
god , you are so annoying !
divorced , no kids .
marry the work , robbins . it &apos;s always there for you .
so , um -- so , no family ?
i have work and you and ... graham .
god , that &apos;s the saddest thing i &apos;ve ever said .
what kind of tumor is it ?
enough .
i need to know if this could
affect your motor skills or your cognition .
you don &apos;t need to know anything that i haven &apos;t --
i need to know if i &apos;m helping you treat patients
with a time bomb in your head !
robbins , i have a team of neurosurgeons
who are far more experienced than you are ,
so your input at this point
is nothing more than an invasion of my privacy .
stop .
drop it .
so it &apos;s inoperable .
who says ?
that &apos;s it . you &apos;re done . you can &apos;t focus .
you &apos;re off the surgery . graham can do it .
go do consults .
fine .
dr. shepherd , do you have a minute ?
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m deborah curzon . i was asked to come talk to you .
deborah , i &apos;m really sorry , but i don &apos;t have time .
dr. shepherd ...
i was asked by the president .
we didn &apos;t get a chance to meet when you were in washington .
i &apos;m the special assistant to the president of the united states .
he asked you to talk to me ?
about leadership of the brain mapping initiative .
we had that conversation .
oh , i remember .
you told him no .
confidentially , he doesn &apos;t love being told no .
he thought another conversation
was the least you could do for him .
those were the words of the president .
we couldn &apos;t have had this conversation through an e @-@ mail ?
i know you &apos;re busy . i can wait for you .
i &apos;ll be here .
you already started on her chest .
the sooner i see a head c.t. --
well , we got here first .
i will wait .
okay , easy . easy .
whoa . it &apos;s way harder than the simulator .
yeah . that &apos;s all right . that &apos;s all right .
you &apos;ll get it back . just concentrate .
yeah . how does it feel ?
it &apos;s amazing .
yeah ?
friggin &apos; hard .
if i had a dollar
for every time you said that about something ,
i &apos;d buy a whole robot leg factory .
suck it , schultz .
he &apos;s jealous .
you &apos;ll see , man .
you just wait .
i got it .
i got it .
let me go .
you got it .
don &apos;t fall , now .
schultz .
sweet !
can i do the stairs ?
that &apos;s enough for one day .
they don &apos;t think you can .
i got this .
no . no .
seriously , don &apos;t .
no !
jordan !
we &apos;re gonna need neuro now !
could be just a concussion , but it &apos;s acting like a bleed .
i &apos;ve already called c.t.
he &apos;s gonna be okay , right ?
sir , he &apos;s my best friend . he &apos;s got to make it .
we &apos;re gonna take care of him .
i &apos;ll meet you in the o.r. ?
no . stay with rick . you &apos;ve done enough .
is it my fault ?
did i push him too hard ?
can i get a 3 @-@ d vascular reconstruction , too ?
do you need that ?
we need the images that we need .
in your opinion .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be right back .
derek , why are you pushing back on this ?
pierce and i both agree ...
i &apos;m sorry , but i think you &apos;re wrong ,
and she called me for an opinion .
she called me for an opinion , as well .
of course she did .
she probably thought you could talk me down .
i need a 3 @-@ d pericardial reconstruction , please .
look at this .
no . look at that .
he doesn &apos;t even eat with me anymore .
grey is in my bed and my bathroom .
i used to eat with my boyfriend at that table .
am i being weird ?
so , i did an ultrasound on april kepner today .
okay , that &apos;s weirder , way weirder
&apos;cause it could have been your baby .
jo , don &apos;t talk .
i &apos;m really bad at these ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m wrong ,
but i think something &apos;s wrong with jackson and april &apos;s baby .
man , your husband can really dig in his heels .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have called me .
he &apos;s digging in his heels to piss me off .
or maybe it &apos;s a you thing .
stop it .
i &apos;m just saying , you got heels , too .
you dig . i &apos;ve seen it .
she agreed with me to piss him off ?
takes two to tango .
i agreed with you because you &apos;re right .
but you shouldn &apos;t have called me ,
not if you think i can sweet @-@ talk derek .
i called you because you &apos;re the best surgeon .
why would you say that ?
see ? it is a you thing .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
nothing .
i have a patient who got hurt , and hunt thinks it &apos;s my fault .
i &apos;m getting divorced again , and arizona thinks it &apos;s my fault .
and basically i destroy whatever i touch .
so , by &quot; nothing , &quot; you meant &quot; everything . &quot;
scans are ready .
you gonna pull a muscle .
what are you talking about ?
yuck . trying to pretend you &apos;re not staring at pierce .
your left eye is gonna pop out of your head .
i don &apos;t know what else to do .
i apologized , which she seemed to hear .
but the next move is hers .
at this point , i just have to sit here and wait for her to come to me .
oh , good idea .
just sit still and stare like a creep .
that &apos;ll get you nothing more than hardened arteries
and a restraining order .
what is that ?
and why on earth do you keep drinking it ?
it &apos;s a kale smoothie . it &apos;s healthy .
kale &apos;s a superfood .
it looks like bile .
doesn &apos;t taste much better .
i &apos;m just gonna stay out of pierce &apos;s way .
hey , uh , richard , do you have a moment ?
yeah , i might .
can i have you look at something ?
how &apos;s he look ?
c.t. showed a multifocal hemorrhage with some edema .
i &apos;ll know more once i &apos;m in there ,
but he &apos;s gonna need a full craniotomy .
all right . page me when you &apos;re out , okay ?
i feel like i owe you an explanation ...
about what you heard last week .
you don &apos;t need --
i had a pill problem .
i got clean .
two years ago , i relapsed ,
and for a brief time , i got into oxy ...
and then shooting oxy .
i lost someone .
um , that was rock bottom ,
and i have been clean ever since .
listen , derek told me everything i need , so you don &apos;t have ...
i work for you
and i respect you and i like you ,
so if it &apos;s all right ,
i don &apos;t care to hang my professional relationships
on derek shepherd &apos;s reputation .
i needed you to hear it from me .
i know it &apos;s a choice , keeping me on .
i know i &apos;m a risk .
we &apos;re all a risk .
we all have something .
i mean , i have my own version .
and it was different . it took a different toll .
it still does , and i push through every day .
and i &apos;m assuming you &apos;re doing the same thing ,
unless i see otherwise .
okay ?
okay .
look how the air is tracking through the fascial planes .
we &apos;ll have to debride the neck , too .
we should have been in there already .
you &apos;re scrubbing in with me , right ?
of course .
any word from your husband ?
no , but when he sees these , he &apos;ll come around .
pierce , is this your mediastinitis girl ?
that is a massive infection .
this is just in a week ?
yeah , that thing moves like a track star .
have you seen the repeat brain scans yet ?
any increase there ?
no , but it &apos;s already invading the pericardium .
yeah , but it &apos;s tricky , though .
we should wait until we talk to derek , see what they found .
sorry . &quot; we &quot; ?
wait . why are you here ?
derek asked me to have a look .
why ?
he wanted a second opinion .
of course -- any opinion but mine .
just do it .
i don &apos;t think i can .
it &apos;s bad , and i &apos;m not good at doing bad stuff .
will you do it ?
what am i doing ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
it &apos;s so bad .
then what am i doing here ? you know what ?
i don &apos;t want to know . whatever it is , you can do it .
just do it .
okay . okay . okay .
hi . um , this is dr. robbins .
um , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m amelia shepherd &apos;s fellow at grey @-@ sloan .
um , yeah .
i @-@ i &apos;m calling about a patient of dr. weaver &apos;s ...
nicole herman ?
yep . uh @-@ huh . no . i &apos;ll wait .
h-- she is ? oh , great , great .
um , well , dr. herman is requesting
that her neuro records be sent to dr. shepherd .
yeah , yeah , histories , scans , c.t.s.
you know what ? actually , could you just --
could you send it all ?
yeah . care of -- of robbins .
thank you . thank you so much .
oh , my --
oh , thanks for taking the time .
yeah , i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
then i &apos;ll cut to the chase .
i was told not to come back to d.c.
without a &quot; yes &quot; from you .
and i have a dog who &apos;s gonna starve ,
so i have to get back .
help me out .
what kind of dog do you have ?
springer spaniel .
damn it . that &apos;s a good dog .
deborah , i &apos;d like to help you out .
i would , but turning down this post
was the hardest decision i ever had to make .
and i made that choice for my family .
i know he will understand that .
yes .
he &apos;s just a hard man to say no to .
i know , but i did it ,
and i know it can be done .
good luck .
hi . um , did you get anything messengered
for , um , dr. shepherd -- a chart ?
it might have been addressed to dr. robbins .
mm . i don &apos;t -- - looking for this ?
yeah . yeah .
thanks .
is this our nicole herman ?
dr. herman ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s bad , right ?
it &apos;s spectacular ,
a big , bad mother of an astrocytoma .
see how it ignores anatomical borders ?
it &apos;s like a perfect butterfly .
look , it starts in the subfrontal
and extends practically into the hypothalamus .
that is a thing of beauty .
is she showing symptoms ?
no . no , but she &apos;s --
well , wait . what kind of symptoms would they be ?
oh , god .
with this , it could be almost anything
from dizziness , headaches ,
uh , vision loss , inappropriate sexual behavior ,
impulse @-@ control stuff , fatigue --
fatigue ?
uh ... she texted me earlier
to say that she needed to lie down for a while .
arizona , who else knows about this ?
people know about this , right ?
yeah , everybody who needs to know knows .
but she &apos;d prefer discretion , you know .
if you could just keep it to yourself ...
of course . i &apos;m a locked box .
thanks .
see you .
based on the information we have ,
we &apos;d like to take holly to surgery now
to get out as much of the chest infection as possible .
well , wait .
wasn &apos;t there talk about brain surgery ?
we feel we can &apos;t wait any longer .
my throat hurts .
can we get her some water ?
not before surgery .
mom , i just want to go home . please take me home .
well , whatever you think is best .
just tell us what to do . we &apos;ll listen .
dr. pierce &apos;s approach is the way to go .
let &apos;s take care of that chest infection ,
and then we &apos;ll do the brain surgery .
holly ?
holly ?
what &apos;s happening to her ?
step out of the way , please .
h @-@ holly ?
her airway &apos;s completely closed ,
and she &apos;s too swollen to intubate .
i need a crash cart and a crike tray now !
right away !
shepherd said he &apos;s in a coma .
yeah . early signs of herniation .
it &apos;s impossible to tell how deep the damage is ,
and there &apos;s no signs of him coming around .
i told you .
hey , i didn &apos;t push him .
i know you think i did ,
but they pushed each other .
you should have stopped them . - owen , they &apos;re --
you know these guys . there &apos;s ...
you don &apos;t know the first thing about them .
you don &apos;t know what risk means to them .
jordan is a 22 @-@ year @-@ old kid who &apos;s asked to defuse bombs
left in a supermarket filled with families .
that &apos;s risk to them .
these guys have to decide in an instant
whether the person they &apos;re about to shoot
is an insurgent with a pistol
or a school kid with a cellphone .
that &apos;s risk .
so , no , they don &apos;t see the danger
in stepping up on a stair .
you should have stopped him .
dr. herman ?
dr. herman --
robbins ... occupied .
sorry .
trach tube and dilator .
we got you . we got you .
what happened ?
we lost her airway , so pierce criked her .
this is what i was worried about .
this is why i &apos;m taking her to surgery .
pierce , i think derek &apos;s right .
what are you even doing here ?
pierce , the steroids you gave her
may have ruptured her abscess --
there &apos;s no evidence of that , and she is hypotensive .
pierce , with respect ,
i have been here longer than you .
you asked for my advice . you ignored it .
we &apos;re doing this . it &apos;s done .
you take over .
book an o.r.
as soon as she is stable , i am taking her up .
excuse me . - derek , you cannot just --
meredith , i am begging you .
this is not about you and me .
this is about this girl .
if we don &apos;t do this ,
her mother is gonna be bathing and feeding her
for the rest of her life .
i am sure of this .
and as sure as you are , i am , too .
you are pulling rank here .
meredith , listen .
and you don &apos;t have rank to pull .
from what i saw on the head c.t ....
i mean , can we all agree
that this is dr. pierce &apos;s patient here ?
she is the department head , and derek is not ,
so if there &apos;s any rank to pull , it &apos;s hers .
so , what would you like to do , dr. pierce ?
let &apos;s take her up .
how long has that been happening ?
none of your business .
how long ? was it sudden ? was it just today ?
eh , it &apos;s happened ... more than once .
you &apos;re jealous .
okay . it stops now . no more .
y @-@ you &apos;re taking advantage of her .
i beg your pardon .
she &apos;s the one in the power position here .
she suggested it . i &apos;m just scoring points .
oh , god , shut up .
dr. robbins ?
you could try . she &apos;s pretty open to ideas .
go away . go away , graham .
dr. robbins , i just need you to look at this ultrasound .
yeah . sure .
is it what i think it is ?
i mean , it &apos;s not , right ?
yeah , it could be , type ii or iii maybe .
oh , god .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i shouldn &apos;t say .
or maybe i should . i don &apos;t know .
tell me what to do .
this is april kepner &apos;s baby .
i haven &apos;t told her . i haven &apos;t told jackson .
i didn &apos;t know what to do . i just wanted us to be sure .
don &apos;t mention it to either of them .
i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll ask herman .
because maybe we &apos;re wrong .
i hope so .
so ...
... what happens now ?
well ...
listen , take some time .
and , uh ... we &apos;ll get you up as soon as you &apos;re ready .
i &apos;ll be ready when jordan &apos;s awake .
he &apos;s going first .
how long till he can walk ?
we &apos;re not sure when he &apos;ll wake up .
it could be days , months .
i &apos;m not just gonna give up on him .
oh , that &apos;s if we &apos;re lucky .
look , i know . i know how bad you feel .
i do .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that you should give up on
the possibility of walking yourself .
i &apos;m sure that jordan wouldn &apos;t want you to .
yeah ? you know what he wants ?
see , he &apos;s my best friend .
oh , no , no , no , i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
see , when i got shipped home to rehab ...
i was ready to give up .
i wanted to quit every day .
but jordan ...
he had this -- this stupid plastic football
that he &apos;d just throw at me every time i &apos;d complain ...
at my face , hard .
and every day , i got a little bit better
just so i could throw it back at him .
he saved my life .
he &apos;s gonna wake up .
and when he does , he &apos;s not gonna see that i s--
that i stole what &apos;s his ...
what he earned .
i am so sorry , but we just ... we don &apos;t know how ...
what are we to you , huh ? what are we ... trash ?
he broke , so you just throw him away ,
move on to the next one ?
screw that .
he &apos;s gonna wake up .
rick .
rick .
are you okay ?
uh i will be . i will be .
could -- could we just pretend
that everything between you and i is okay ,
just for a little bit ?
i could use that .
yeah .
i feel like everything is going wrong ,
and i have no idea what to do about it .
i feel ...
like every single thing i am doing is wrong .
you will figure it out .
you will .
you will , too .
thanks .
do you ... miss me ... at all ?
of course .
just ...
not enough .
this infection is a lot deeper than the c.t. showed .
how are you doing ?
okay .
it &apos;s really adhered to her ascending aorta .
be careful . i &apos;m coming across a lot of adhesions .
i think this would be a lot easier
without those two breathing down our necks .
welcome to my life .
the girl &apos;s brain could be herniating right now .
she thinks i &apos;ve been working against her .
and to be truthful ,
i have given her plenty of reason to believe that .
but that is not the case right here .
i swear it .
yeah , i know .
and i know how frustrating it can be
when someone chooses only to see you one way .
they &apos;re both so much like their mother .
you really screwed me here , with pierce ...
first the dinner , now this .
you know that , right ?
yeah . sorry about that .
she &apos;s bradying .
constrictive pericarditis .
i &apos;m gonna have to strip the entire pericardium .
grey ...
i &apos;m here .
dry laps and a 15 blade , please .
are they still watching ?
you can count on it .
hey , um , dr. edwards and i
would like you to look at an ultrasound .
have to be later .
got paged for an emergency &quot; c. &quot;
you &apos;ll assist .
uh , will you excuse us , please ?
uh , well , come find me later .
you spoke to graham ?
you spoke to graham ?
i was worried .
robbins , i don &apos;t know how many orgasms i have left in life ,
but it may be fewer than flavors of ice cream ,
so i can &apos;t spare any .
stop stealing my orgasms .
i didn &apos;t try --
and stop invading my privacy .
i was worried about you .
well , it &apos;s not your business to be worried .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m a doctor . it &apos;s my nature .
and -- and you &apos;re sick . and i want to help .
i want to keep you and our patients out of danger ,
and i just found you having a quickie with graham .
graham , okay , so --
and i have a hard time believing that that &apos;s not a symptom ,
and also , it &apos;s against -- it &apos;s against hospital rules .
robbins , when you have an expiration date of five months ,
it &apos;s amazing how many rules you don &apos;t give a damn about .
graham is a nominal surgeon , and he &apos;s a complete tool ,
but he &apos;s young , he &apos;s attractive , and he &apos;s very physically fit .
what you saw was not a symptom of a tumor .
it was a symptom of dying soon .
so i &apos;m gonna screw as many grahams as i can .
and i -- and i -- i totally support that .
c @-@ section . let &apos;s go .
you paged me 911 ?
is it a me thing ?
is what a you thing ?
god , can you keep something in your head for like two seconds ?
me and derek and this patient .
am i just digging in because it &apos;s him ?
911 for this ?
i was telling a mom
her 5 @-@ year @-@ old has a spinal malformation .
i need two minutes .
two minutes .
and promise me you won &apos;t crash in my bed tonight .
because we saved this patient from organ failure ,
but now she could wake up with brain damage .
what if you were right ?
what if he wasn &apos;t being a stubborn , pig @-@ faced jackass ?
what if it is me ?
take shepherd out of the equation .
if it was another doctor you were going up against ,
if it was , uh , me , or --
someone who was really good , like bailey ?
would you have made the same decision for your patient
if it wasn &apos;t him ?
thank you .
sure . and bite me .
i ended up taking a stand against pierce .
that doesn &apos;t sound like staying out of her way .
ah , i didn &apos;t know what i was getting myself into .
i thought it was just a consult .
shepherd screwed me again .
i don &apos;t care for the way that sounds .
where are you going ?
up . i got my wrist thingy on .
i &apos;ve got to get my billion steps a day .
i feel like i &apos;m making a bunch of steps in the wrong direction .
maybe i should apologize to pierce .
apologize ?
haven &apos;t you apologized enough already ?
you are a good man , a great surgeon .
you shouldn &apos;t be turning
yourself inside out for her or anybody else .
you deserve better .
and if she can &apos;t see that , she doesn &apos;t deserve you .
i &apos;m just afraid i &apos;ve undone the progress i &apos;ve already made .
okay . now i &apos;m bored ,
bored with kale smoothies and walking up stairs
and listening to you talk about pierce .
you sound like a broken record .
sorry .
kale rage talking . but i &apos;m not wrong .
do not follow me .
shepherd , you were looking for us ?
yes .
uh , jordan &apos;s awake .
he came around .
thank god . that &apos;s great .
wait . he is awake , but unresponsive .
there &apos;s no new or recurrent hemorrhage ,
but it &apos;s too soon to know how much function he &apos;ll regain
or if there will be deficits .
i &apos;m sorry .
does he have people , uh , besides his friend ?
his parents are in florida .
they &apos;re on their way .
hunt , can i talk to you outside ?
sure .
you have people , right ?
what do you mean ?
i just mean , um -- i mean , you &apos;re not trying to ...
it &apos;s hard to deal with all this stuff on your own .
but you have meredith and derek , so ...
yeah .
and meetings .
i &apos;m pushing through . that &apos;s what we do .
right .
do you ?
have people ?
i &apos;m --
that &apos;s ...
i &apos;m fine .
no , i know .
but you &apos;re right there ,
living in that little tin box on my brother &apos;s back lawn .
i mean , i keep saying i &apos;m gonna move out ,
but i &apos;m still up at the house ,
watching them glare at each other .
let me know if you , you know -- if you need people .
i &apos;m around .
thanks .
oh , and thanks for the update .
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i think i need to take a step back .
what do you mean ?
the program , the vets . i &apos;m --
you were right , owen . i @-@ i don &apos;t know these guys .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m trying to help them .
i &apos;m ruining their lives . - it -- it was an accident .
i know i was angry , but you can &apos;t just stop --
rick says he won &apos;t move forward until jordan &apos;s all right .
callie , that is -- - jordan might not be all right .
and i &apos;m not just gonna throw rick aside
and move on to someone else . i can &apos;t do that .
so you &apos;re gonna just stop &apos; cause things got hard ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re hurt ? that is not acceptable .
you push through it .
you &apos;re not gonna give up on the program or on rick .
get him back here .
owen , for what ?
get him back here , and -- - i &apos;m don &apos;t want to give him false hope .
then give him real hope .
okay . okay . i get it .
stop throwing the football at my face .
what ?
nothing . it -- it worked .
okay , claire , i need to do a neuro check .
i thought you said the surgery was successful .
we just have to make sure
there was no problem with the brain abscess .
she could have brain damage ?
he &apos;s just making sure .
can you follow this ?
can you give me a good squeeze ?
try and squeeze .
is she okay ?
dr. shepherd ?
from what i can see .
you know , actually , why don &apos;t we ask her ?
holly , how are you feeling ?
her second surgery for the brain abscess
will be tomorrow ,
but i don &apos;t foresee any problems .
thank you so much .
doctors .
nice work delivering the placenta .
your sutures need improvement , which is surprising .
now ?
yes , um , we need to show you an ultrasound .
um , i @-@ i don &apos;t trust myself ,
and robbins thinks we might be wrong .
robbins , a fetal surgeon who can &apos;t read an ultrasound
is like a chef who can &apos;t boil water .
just tell me what i &apos;m looking at .
what do you think it is ?
i &apos;m asking you .
i want to know what you think you know .
i &apos;m concerned that it &apos;s osteogenesis imperfecta .
define it , please .
a congenital birth defect
in which the child has fragile bones
that are easily broken and for no reason .
with the more fatal cases ,
sometimes you can see the fractures in utero .
i assume that we &apos;re wrong . i mean , it &apos;s so rare .
what makes you suspect it ?
size and mineralization of the head ,
no movement in the fetus , short femurs that haven &apos;t grown .
prognosis ?
that &apos;s ... what i &apos;m asking you .
well , it &apos;s very sad .
if it is , indeed , type ii and the infant survives birth ,
they don &apos;t usually live more than a couple of days or weeks .
robbins , someone you know ?
a friend .
i &apos;m very , very sorry .
there &apos;s got to be something we can do .
i mean , what -- what can i do ?
be there for her .
oh , uh , edwards !
i forgive you .
y @-@ you -- why ?
for spilling the beans about our little buddha boy .
it was an honest mistake , and i was a total jerk .
i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m honestly kind of glad to know .
i &apos;m gonna tell jackson tonight .
o @-@ okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh ... like i said , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s really okay .
you &apos;re really committing to this thing , aren &apos;t you ?
got to get my steps in .
dr. webber !
ooh , look who &apos;s coming around .
do not apologize .
you sided with shepherd today .
i did .
i want to know why .
pierce , it was a coin toss .
could have gone either way .
but , uh , i &apos;m glad it went yours .
i &apos;m not asking for an &quot; attaboy &quot; here . i --
you really didn &apos;t think
the lesions in her chest warranted immediate care ?
absolutely .
but it was a catch @-@ 22,
so i did a quick risk / benefit analysis ,
outcome measurements , oh , adverse effects .
it makes quite a quantitative list .
really ?
well , it &apos;s not infallible , obviously ,
but it &apos;s right most of the time .
may i see it ?
no . i -- i do it in my head .
all of -- all of that ?
well , uh , i had lots of years of practice .
i &apos;d be very interested
in going over that list with you if you have time .
um , you know , well , now &apos;s not a --
not a great time , but , uh --
but , you know , maybe i could catch up with you in the morning
or we could grab coffee .
i would appreciate that .
thank you .
can you hurry up ?
hang on . it &apos;s meredith .
she and shepherd are having a thing .
do you want to wait for her ?
we could give her a ride to our place ,
save her the trouble of coming over later .
you could tuck her in ,
leave a little mint on her pillow .
come on . she &apos;s not there that much .
she &apos;s always in our bed .
and -- and now arizona is in our shower .
i actually feel like i &apos;m part of a commune .
shut up .
look , i told you it &apos;s your house , too .
yeah , apparently , you say that to all the girls .
listen , that house was always open .
even when mer hated me , i could be there .
people went through their crap ,
they needed a place to be , they came there .
you should understand that more than anybody .
and as long as i &apos;m the ...
it stays open , all right ?
all right .
and ... come on .
you in my bed and meredith in my bed
are two really different things .
they better be .
what , you need me to prove it ?
where are you going ?
i think i need more convincing .
come on !
can i ?
go for it .
there you are . listen , i think --
i got your page . why are you down here ?
wait . what are you -- what are you doing ?
you told me to be discreet , so i set up in here .
nobody comes down here .
no . no . take them down .
why ?
give it back .
just give it all back .
if she finds me with these , she will kill me .
just -- you know what ? forget that i ever told you .
i thought you said that
everybody who needed to know knew .
yeah , and that &apos;s her and that &apos;s me ,
and she doesn &apos;t know that i know all of this , okay ?
she cannot find out that i stole these .
arizona --
i thought that she was dangerous and reckless ,
and it turns out that she &apos;s just --
she &apos;s just dying .
and she &apos;s alone and she &apos;s smart
and she &apos;s funny and horny and lonely ...
arizona , listen --
... and she deserves to die however she wants to .
and i know what to look for now , and i can watch her .
and -- and she deserves to die
with whatever dignity she can po--
arizona , shut up and listen to me !
i think i can remove this tumor .
i think i can save her life .
dr. herman ?
can i just ask you about these scans again ?
oh , yes .
good catch , by the way . sharp eye .
is there really nothing to help their baby ?
i mean , if anyone knows some way to help them , it &apos;s you .
edwards , i wish i could tell you there was ,
but it wouldn &apos;t serve you ... or them .
cases like this are usually hopeless .
this baby would have a very short , painful life .
i &apos;m sorry .
so cute , sitting like a little buddha .
what was that about ?
i can get the kids if you want to just go home .
did you remember zola &apos;s coat ? you forgot it yesterday .
i remembered the coat .
she can &apos;t keep going out in the cold
if she doesn &apos;t have a coat .
she has the coat .
yesterday you forgot it .
i remembered the damn coat . why don &apos;t you trust me ?
of course -- for god &apos;s sakes , meredith , of course i trust you .
why did you call richard today for a second opinion ?
if that had been any other surgeon --
dr. bailey -- would you have done it ?
it was a surgical consult .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a surgical consult or a coat .
you don &apos;t trust me ,
and all you want to do is fight me .
i don &apos;t want to fight with you ,
but i &apos;m not gonna compromise myself , meredith ,
just because you think i --
well , you &apos;ve already done that .
you &apos;ve already compromised yourself
and diminished yourself for me .
i feel that --
your pissiness and your resentment , derek .
you know why ? do you know why i resent you ?
because you &apos;ve never had my back on this ,
not since the day i told you i would stay .
i told you that you and the kids were more important .
you have been determined to prove me wrong ,
that this is the wrong choice .
i have proven it -- because you can &apos;t be happy here .
you diminish everyone around you .
i did this for you . i gave up everything for you .
there it is -- everything .
you gave up everything .
that was everything to you ?
where are you going ?
nobody &apos;s memory is perfect or complete .
we jumble things up .
we lose track of time .
derek , slow down .
no . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m not gonna do this anymore , this constant battling .
i &apos;m not battling ,
but i just am not gonna let you just
yes .
yes , you think i &apos;m some sort of tyrant
determined to keep you down .
you keep you down , and now i &apos;m paying for it .
and i don &apos;t know how to fix it .
you should have just gone to d.c.
is that what you want ?
because that door is wide open .
that &apos;s what you want !
meredith , they offered me the job again -- today .
i could take this job right now .
we are in one place ...
derek .
derek .
right . meredith .
... then another .
you should . take it .
deborah , it &apos;s dr. shepherd .
glad i could catch you .
it was great that you came by today .
please tell the president
i would be thrilled to accept the post .
yes , absolutely .
we can talk more then .
i look forward to it . i will see you soon .
good . go .
oh , i &apos;m going .
no . i mean it .
go now .
and it all feels like one long , inescapable moment .
go .
so , what does it mean ?
richard !
what do we take away ?
which pieces will haunt us ?
i was ... jealous .
so i ruined it .
hurt us ?
richard !
end us ?
inspire us ?
he &apos;s very dreamy . but he is not the sun .
you are .
it &apos;s just like my mother used to say --
the carousel never stops turning .
you can &apos;t get off .
