That's not gonna make her get here any faster.
Maybe not, but it'll prove my point.
Which is...?
Which is if she'd taken Boylston street like I said,
she would have been here 10 minutes ago.
She may not have the letter.
I went to see the department doctor a week ago.
I was fine then. I'm finer now.
It's just taking them too long to clear me for duty.
Okay, look, I know how badly
you really want to get back to work,
but I must admit that
it's been really nice having you here,
and I'm sad that you're leaving.
Me too.
So sad.
You know, you couldn't be happier
if I told you that I had magically turned
all the lettuce in the world into beer.
Make it happen. We'll find out.
You should consider buying some luggage.
Everybody thought I was homeless.
Bags don't show dirt.
I'll take that.
It's not in -- ma, is this everything?
Yeah.
Look, I understand you're disappointed,
but the doctor must think
that you need some more time to heal.
No, I need to go back to my own apartment
and my job so I can feel like a grown woman.
A grown woman who uses garbage bags for luggage.
But I see your point.
Lie down. I'll get you some snacks.
What am I supposed to do all day --
Lay here and dream about a world with no salad?
Oh, you could read magazines, and you could --
You could just let your mom take care of you.
Okay, but as my best friend and a doctor,
Will you do me one favor?
Anything.
Put me in a medically induced coma.
I'm going to the market.
Just one little coma.
Is it really too much to ask?
You'd have better luck asking me to give you OxyContin.
Well, can I have some of those, then?
Hell of a way to get my attention, Rick.
Well, thanks for coming, Vince.
As if I had a choice.
I've barely seen you since high school,
you tell me you're dying,
and I'm the only one you can trust with your final request.
Well, what can I say?
You won the last-request competition.
Who came in second?
Guy in cellblock "D."
So, listen, Vince, um...
I got six months left... tops.
I don't want to die with my son still thinking
that I set the fire
that killed his mother and his sister.
Hey, I'm a cop, not a hypnotist.
I did not set that fire.
Even if that's true, Rick,
you have exhausted all your appeals.
I don't care about the courts. Listen to me.
My son only knows me
as this selfish, lying, fall-down drunk.
That's not who I am anymore.
I'll call him.
See if he'd be willing to come by and say goodbye.
He won't. He doesn't want to hear from me.
After I got locked up,
I wrote him a letter a week -- sometimes two.
He never responded.
About three years ago,
The letters started coming back with no forwarding address.
Listen to me, Vince.
The only way my son will see me
is if he knows I did not set that fire,
which I did not.
I swear it.
Well, you seem like you've gotten your act together in here.
Sometimes, prison does that for people.
Write another letter.
I'll find Jason. I'll take it to him myself.
You were the smartest guy in the neighborhood,
and you've been a smart cop for a long time.
Vince, all I'm asking
is that you just take a look at my case.
Give it two or three hours,
and if you're not convinced, then just walk away.
Don't give it another thought.
I'll take a look.
But no promise about what happens after that.
Thank you.
She wanted to massage my feet.
Well, that's very nice.
Yes, when I was 3.
Now it's just a little weird.
You almost died. She's your mother.
She's just having some kind of a post-traumatic response.
Uh, come in.
Sorry to bother you on a saturday night.
What a surprise. Thank you.
Barolo 2009. What's the occasion?
Well, I've been looking over a case from a while back,
And I was hoping you'd be willing
to look at yesterday's science through today's lens.
How old is old?
Wow. 15 years.
Double homicide, arson.
Rick Sullivan. Mm.
Killed his wife and child.
Did you get your medical-release letter yet?
No.
Sorry.
Oh, vince, come on.
The department rules are clear --
No department business
until you've got a doctor's okay to return to duty.
It's a file that I'm reading at hom--
No, someone else's home.
Technically, it's department business.
You were in the drug unit 15 years ago.
This isn't even your case.
No. And I'm annoyed at myself
for saying yes I would do it.
But it's hard to tell a dying man to buzz off,
especially if you've known him for 50 years.
You're a very good man, Vince.
Yes. And a bit of a hard-ass
when it comes to some of your closest friends.
It's a day or two. You'll be fine.
I went through the files.
The D.A. had a pretty strong case against him.
Rick was a broke alcoholic,
and his wife had an insurance policy
worth 750,000 bucks.
The clincher... is the arson report.
They found acetone on his pants.
It's the same accelerant that was used to start the fire.
When we were kids,
Rick would give you the shirt off his back.
He took a lot of hits
protecting his sisters from his dad.
If the science says he did it, he did it.
All I promised him was a fair look.
Well, I guess we should get started.
And when I say "We," of course, I mean the two of you
because I'm not cleared for duty, so...
Good luck. Good night.
Sleep well.
I did not see that coming.
Thanks for coming in on Sunday.
No problem.
I just figure while Maura's looking at the forensics,
it wouldn't hurt to take another look at the shoe leather.
I was just sitting here for a minute.
Like we talked about --
better than leaving it empty all the time.
Well, the table was pretty packed anyway.
Yeah, where'd that come from?
I brought up the archives in case we needed them.
Did you know them well?
I never even met the wife.
Saw Rick and his daughter in a park a couple times.
A cute kid.
So I've been through the interviews with Rick.
Over five days, he never once changed his story.
He said he got drunk and blacked out like most nights,
came to coughing up smoke in the yard.
The son, Jason, was lucky that tree
was right outside his bedroom window.
I doubt it felt lucky at the time.
Yeah. Were you able to track him down?
He's married with a baby. They live in Dedham.
You gonna talk to him?
Not unless we find something.
The kid's been through enough.
If we don't get traction,
we're gonna do this for one day. That's it.
We're not looking to overturn a conviction here --
just looking for doubt.
Maura wants to talk to me.
Well, I'm all set here.
I'll let you know if I find anything.
All right, I was thinking about going over to Rudy's
and picking up your favorite pastrami sandwich.
Hello?
I mean, I usually mention Rudy's,
and you're at the front door with car keys in your teeth.
What are you doing, ma?
Just wondering what's grabbed your attention.
I was just reading this fascinating article --
"10 ways to please my man
and make him happy as a clam...with a candle."
Well, that's a new one.
It's fascinating stuff.
The candle or the clam?
I'm sorry. What -- you were saying something before?
I was gonna go to Rudy's and pick us up some sandwiches.
Oh, really? Yeah.
I -- that sounds great. I'd love that.
All right. I'll be back in a bit.
Thanks.
Least I could do. So?
So, I looked over everything.
The burn pattern and depth of charring indicate a fire
that burned unusually hot,
so I took another look at the victims' autopsies.
M.E. said they died of smoke inhalation.
Well, in 1999, that was the catchall term
used to describe inhalation-type death,
but five years ago, a study out of Johns Hopkins
demonstrated that some S.I. cases
are actually deaths from breathing superheated air.
How hot is superheated?
It instantly sears your airways,
causing death long before smoke and flame.
What does this mean for Rick?
The fire in the Sullivan home was too hot
to be caused by acetone alone.
The arson unit determined that acetone
was the only fire accelerant,
and the D.A.'s case hinged on that point.
They were wrong.
I thought you'd be more pleased.
Oh, I'm...
I guess I was pretty sure I'd be walking away from this.
Well, my findings
do not absolutely exclude Rick as a suspect.
No, but it's enough to make me glad
I didn't tell him I wouldn't help him.
Thanks.
I'm sure Rick would say thank you if he could.
Well, I'm glad, but I'm doing this for you.
I have confirmed these are the most up-to-date lists
on flash points and flame temperatures
for flammable chemicals.
Great. I'm ready to get started.
Well, thank you for doing this on the weekend.
I really do need your expertise
to run this fire-simulation program.
No problem. I'd much rather be here
than at home being mad at myself
for not going sightseeing.
Using the crime-scene photos,
I created a digital replica of the Sullivan house,
Focusing on the hallway.
This is the simulation for 100% acetone.
Exactly as I expected.
The flame temperature doesn't rise above 390 degrees,
and that's just not hot enough
to generate superheated smoke.
Any thoughts on what it could be?
Let's try ether.
Its flame temperature is high --
About 3,500 degrees.
That's too hot.
That would result in more charring
than what we saw in the crime-scene photos.
There are no hardwood floors in their house.
It's all carpet and linoleum.
Wait a minute.
It's not that the chemist didn't find the other accelerant.
It's that he misunderstood what it was.
I'm sorry...?
The answer that we need --
It was in this report all along.
About Korsak's case...
How about "Hello. How are you?"
Hello.
And about Korsak's case...
What do you know about it?
Frankie, there's no time for that. Listen.
Rick was a suspect
because he had two motives to kill his wife --
One, she was having an affair.
Two, she had a life-insurance policy.
Okay.
Well, motive was moved to the back burner
when they found acetone on his pants,
which means that no one confirmed
who Tanya's boyfriend was.
So he couldn't be eliminated as a suspect.
Wait. How do you know any of this?
You haven't been cleared -- - Just find the boyfriend.
Hey. Hot pastrami.
Oh, I could think of nothing else.
The original chemist tested 38 materials
inside the Sullivan home --
Drywall, door sills, fabric, foam, plastic --
Are you gonna list all the materials he tested?
Yes.
This is usually when Jane says, "Get to the point"
before she's overcome with an urge to strangle me
with her bare hands.
I miss her.
The chemist found, uh, substantial amounts of acetone,
as well as traces of other chemicals
that he discounted as burn-off.
Meaning the stuff left behind from everything that melted in the fire?
Yes. And one of those discounted chemicals
was toluene, a solvent.
But it would only have been present as a burn-off
if the Sullivans had hardwood floors.
Which they didn't.
Exactly.
So, the D.A. was wrong
about there being only one fire accelerant,
which is why we need to retest Rick's clothes
for the presence of toluene.
If you don't find any,
how does that prove Rick didn't set the fire?
The acetone and toluene
had to have been poured from a single container.
Otherwise, we would be seeing two burn patterns, not one.
So it would be impossible for Rick to get splattered
with one chemical and not the other?
And when we test his jeans, if there's no toluene...
We have forensic proof that Rick is innocent.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
How happy are you you didn't tell him to buzz off?
Homicide cases -- Tanya Sullivan and Becky Sullivan?
Right.
These aren't your cases, Vince.
They're not even open.
I know.
Just grab the files for me, will you?
Sure, just as soon as I get the okay
from the lead detective and the D.A.
Two signatures, easy-peasy.
That's BPD2410 and 2413.
What?
I need the files now.
Oh, no. Everything is time-stamped.
Once I get the forms...
You will.
...and then you'll get the files.
A guy is dying in prison.
We're all dying, Vince.
Oh, come on, Smitts.
Do the right thing here.
I am. I'm following the rules.
So forms and procedures and time stamps --
they're more important than justice?
Didn't say that.
Yes, you did.
Don't forget to wash it first.
But it says "Prewashed."
Really?
Hello?
Evidence lockup won't play ball and give us the jeans.
We need the evidence to get the D.A.'s permission.
But we need the D.A.'s permission to get the evidence.
Well, talk about a catch-22.
Smitts won't budge at all?
Oh, he doesn't know the meaning of the word.
I think he ate a rule book, and it got stuck in his colon.
That's not how digestion works.
I know, but you asked me to be more delicate when I say,
"That guy's got a rule book stuck up his..."
I got nothing.
Well, there's got to be someone
who can go over this guy's head.
Nobody's gonna put their ass on the line for a guy like Rick.
So, after all this,
it just comes down to a heartless bureaucracy?
Yeah, I-I guess. I guess it does.
Tanya Sullivan had a boyfriend?
Uh, I mean, uh, if -- if she had a boyfriend,
then that would be a new lead. Am I right?
"If Rick not guilty --"
That should say "Isn't guilty."
Uh, "The real arsonist had a motive."
The real arsonist had a motive.
You know what? Those are my good cloth napkins.
Can't you just write on a piece of paper
like a normal person?
You took files out of the box, didn't you?
What do you mean? What does he mean?
Not many.
I should be mad that you ignored department policy,
but sometimes your blatant disregard for the rules
works to my advantage. Tell me what you got.
Apology accepted.
Jane was right.
Tanya Sullivan got arrested a few weeks before the fire.
She was in an altercation in a bar,
but the charges were dropped.
I tracked down every witness in the report.
Anybody got a good memory?
Uh, one person remembered
Tanya was with a guy who went by "Sal."
Short for...?
Salvador Briglio.
He's 15 years older now,
But the description the witness gave still matches.
How'd you get him?
Uh, I just cross-referenced variations of the name "Sal"
with parking tickets issued near the bar
where Tanya got arrested.
So he's a regular?
Five to six nights a week.
And he ran his mouth off a lot, too.
One person overheard Sal warning Tanya
to sleep with one eye open.
He said he was gonna kill her and her loser husband.
How long before the fire was that?
Uh, a few weeks.
It was probably a breakup fight.
Tanya told him to get lost.
I'll bet he hated losing Tanya to a drunk like Rick.
Well, the year of the fire,
Sal worked at a full-service marina in Falmouth.
Guess which chemicals are used
in deck paint and boat maintenance.
Acetone and toluene.
Yep.
I think this could be our guy.
I was very impressed with your work yesterday.
Oh, I just hit some computer keys.
You did the hard part.
I'm sure thankful I don't wear that getup anymore.
Polyester chafes like you wouldn't believe.
Is it pure polyester? Not even a blend?
Pure.
Detective Rizzoli.
Great to have you back at work.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not back at work.
Oh. Well, you look fantastic anyway.
Thank you, Nina.
You look not like you at all.
Yeah. What's the vibe you're getting?
Like...stuffy, uptight, professional?
Wait a minute. That's -- that's my suit.
And what do you mean, "Stuffy"?
And that's my blouse.
Well, I didn't think you would mind.
I've never seen you wear this outfit.
Well, because it isn't an outfit.
That blouse is eveningwear, and the suit is for work,
which is why the skirt is knee-length.
Or, at least, it's supposed to be.
Okay, Jane, what's really going on here?
What do you mean?
Why are you dressed like a flight attendant?
First of all, I'm dressed like a librarian.
I'm wearing glasses on a chain, for god's sake.
Have you ever checked out a book?
Well, have you ever been on a plane?
Because that scarf you're wearing screams,
"In the event of a water landing,
your seat cushion can also be used as a floatation device."
That better?
Much.
Good. I got to be 100% librarian
if I'm gonna pull this off.
Pull what off?
What just happened?
I haven't heard the name Tanya Sullivan in years.
Were you romantically involved with her?
Sure. I was involved with a lot of women back then.
Tanya was arrested at a bar a few weeks before she died.
You know why?
Long time ago.
15 years. But a lot of people
still remember your fight with Tanya that night.
What was it he said, again?
"I'll kill you.
I'll kill you both -- you and that loser."
And my personal favorite,
"Sleep with one eye open, you bitch."
That's pretty vivid stuff, Sal.
I was a hothead.
I said a lot of stupid stuff. I didn't mean it.
Sounded pretty mad.
I treated Tanya like a queen.
Her husband treated her like garbage,
But she cuts me loose so she can work on her marriage.
Look where that got her.
Yeah, let's look at where that got her.
She burned to death in the middle of the night
with her 7-year-old daughter.
Did you know her kids were in the house?
Did you care?
I didn't know because I didn't do this.
I wasn't even there.
Yeah, where were you?
On a fishing boat with four other guys,
24/7 for a week.
Names and numbers.
You know, I don't even know
why you're bothering with this, man.
Excuse me?
Rick Sullivan set that fire,
and nobody who knew him has any doubt about that.
Sit tight, Sal.
Uh, thanks.
His alibi's airtight.
He was 40 miles offshore -- the Susan Marie.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
We got a guy sitting in jail
for a crime we don't think he committed.
Pretty far from okay.
Thanks.
D.A.'s at a fundraiser in Cambridge.
Why don't I talk to him,
and you try and wrangle the other signature we need
to get the jeans released?
Why don't you just test them now?
Oh, I know. Get it all out --
Rules, policy, blah, blah, blah.
No, no, no, no, no.
Right now, I'm just so grateful that you're so stubborn
you don't care about getting fired.
I could get fired?
Department rule 110, section 27 --
"Officers on medical leave."
You're learning a lot studying for that test.
This is -- this is just between us, right?
How did you get Smitts to give you the jeans?
What -- you didn't see the wall calendar
with all the sexy women chewing on their glasses?
Last month was the librarian.
No?
And you call yourselves detectives.
There is acetone on Rick's jeans.
We knew that from the original test.
However, there are no other chemical signatures
that can connect him to the fire --
specifically, toluene.
Well, if the acetone didn't get on Rick
from starting the fire, where did it come from?
I pulled up his medical records,
and the night of the fire,
Rick was taken to the emergency room
and treated for nausea and stomach pains.
From smoke inhalation.
I thought so, too, until I read the lab results.
Rick has a condition called alcoholic ketoacidosis.
Can you take maalox for that?
Not quite.
Heavy drinking caused his body
to produce an excess of acetone.
The only way for the body to rid itself of the acetone
is through urination. Paragraph two.
"The test sample contained a strong concentration
of acetone, uric acid, and ammonia."
Urine?
Correct.
So the acetone on his pants isn't from starting a fire.
I can't wait to see the look on the D.A.'s face
when I show him this -- that our proof
that Rick Sullivan didn't kill his family
is that he pissed his pants.
Jason Sullivan?
Sergeant Detective Korsak, Boston homicide.
Oh, my God. Did something happen to my wife? My son?
No, no, no, no. They're fine.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.
What's this about, then?
Your father.
I hope you've come to tell me that he's dead.
No.
There's new evidence that could exonerate him.
Is this new evidence
gonna bring back my mother and my sister?
Look, Jason, I know that's a terrible loss,
but it's not something I believe your father did.
Just leave me alone, Sergeant.
I know it's hard to take it in.
No, what's hard to take was having a father
who drank away his paycheck
and tried to kill his entire family.
You want me to believe he didn't do it?
You show me the guy who did.
Hey, ma.
Hi. How come you're dressed like a... flight attendant?
Librarian.
Playing dress-up -- it's kind of strange,
but, you know, when you're bored and have nothing else --
I went to headquarters, ma.
I had to help out Korsak.
You-- you really love your job, don't you?
When are you gonna get it?
I love what I do.
This came for you two days ago.
Is that from the department doctor?
Yeah.
You hid this from me?
I wasn't ready for you to go back.
Well, that's not your decision, ma.
I know, and I-I hate it.
I hate this whole thing.
I hate the fact that you have a job
where you can get hurt so easily.
I don't even know if I'm cleared, so...
I steamed it open.
No.
You can go back in two days.
Yes! Ma! Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, wonderful news.
That's just wonderful.
Oh, come on.
I'm ready.
Well, I'm not, Jane.
I fixed you up,
and now you're gonna go back out there,
and -- and I'm gonna stay here and worry.
Not tonight.
Okay?
Come on. Tonight, it's just --
it's just you and me, all right?
And -- and we'll -- we'll watch a movie,
and we'll sit here on the couch,
and you can massage my feet if you want to,
even though I hope you don't.
Come on. What do you want to watch?
I'm gonna go make some Grilled Cheese.
I love you, ma.
Well, you're only saying that
because you're getting your way.
Do you understand what I just said?
I might be able to convince the D.A.
to overturn the conviction.
Did you talk to Jason?
Yes.
What'd he say?
All right.
Don't get me wrong, Vince.
I'd love to get out of here.
It's just that the only jury I care about is my son.
If he still thinks I'm guilty, then I'm guilty.
But I appreciate it. Thank you.
You're a better man than I remember.
That was the D.A.
He'll reopen the case?
If we come up with more than 15-year-old jeans.
You come up with anything?
I talked to a lot of people who didn't like Rick.
Bartenders, owner of the liquor store,
a bunch of people he owed money to.
Any of them look good for the arson?
No, they're all regular people -- working stiffs.
None of them would have set fire to his house.
Still, Jane's right.
Somebody had to have a motive to kill Rick and his family.
I'll recanvass, talk to the neighbors.
Maybe time loosened up a few tongues.
Sorry, detective.
We didn't buy the house until after the fire.
Yeah, in fact, the fire was a blessing of sorts.
You know a woman and her daughter died in that fire?
That's not what my husband meant.
It's just that, well, we drove by the day after,
Just to check it out.
Yeah.
To see if there was potential to rebuild
and maybe make a better offer than the insurance company?
Yes, but when we got here,
we saw the sign in the window of the house next door.
Yeah, no realtor -- just a number.
In fact, the seller didn't even negotiate.
Just accepted our first offer over the phone.
The owner wanted to make a quick sale?
Yeah, I guess.
He never even showed up to the closing.
Remember that?
He just gave our lawyer a power of attorney.
Do you remember that guy's name?
Melvin Tuttle.
He's got a few felony assault and battery charges,
but mostly drug stuff --
for cooking and selling crystal meth.
Field interrogation/observation reports show
Melvin was associating with a local biker gang --
The devil's scorpions.
Sounds like a typical outlaw-biker drug operation.
The scorpions supply the chemicals.
And Melvin cooks the meth.
Still it doesn't explain
why Melvin sells his house
and takes off right after the fire...
Unless he was responsible for it in some way.
We'll never know.
Six weeks after the fire,
Melvin Tuttle was stabbed to death
in Jacksonville, Florida.
一男子在杰克逊维尔码头附近被刺身亡
Melvin Tuttle might have burned the house down,
but why would he?
I don't think he did.
I mean, come on. The guy takes off to Florida.
He's dead six weeks later?
I'm betting he ran because somebody was after him.
How long until Melvin's homicide file gets here?
Jacksonville's digging it out of cold cases.
Said they'd overnight it to us.
All right. Well, we can keep working while we wait.
Is it possible they were in business together?
I could recheck the forensics and see if I can identify
any meth by-products in the Sullivan house.
We need to nail down a connection
between Rick and Melvin Tuttle.
Yeah, and figure out
why someone wanted them both dead.
I'm gonna go back and work with Frankie and Nina.
I will see you tomorrow at BPD, detective.
See you tomorrow.
You got anything?
Uh, the drug unit has plenty on Melvin Tuttle.
Nothing on Rick Sullivan.
What about phone records and incident reports?
We're still checking.
There's nothing yet.
I didn't want to break the rules and show up early.
What have you two been doing?
We're looking at old drug-unit surveillance videos.
We've pulled the ones where Melvin was tagged.
We're looking for any sign that he and Rick knew each other.
Any luck?
Not so far.
Okay, let's -- let's look at the next one.
This is three days before the fire.
That's the 1310 -- headquarters for the scorpions.
They are not too happy with Melvin.
Wait, wait. Pause that.
Is that Rick's truck?
Nina, run a DMV check on Rick Sullivan.
DMV doesn't keep records that far back.
I'll check the Department of Revenue.
What?
Massachusetts charges a road tax
on all vehicles registered.
Enjoy that when you buy a car.
Well, Rick drove a red Chevy 1500.
Okay, that's a Ford.
Nina, pull up the exterior crime-scene photo from the fire.
Rick's red pickup truck in his driveway.
It's almost the same color as Melvin's.
They live right next door to each other,
and both own red pickup trucks.
So someone wanted Melvin Tuttle dead.
When they went to kill him, they burned down the wrong house.
Ma, today should be an easy day.
Yeah, you're just saying that for my sake.
No, no, I'm not, really.
We're waiting on a homicide file from Florida.
All I'm gonna do today is -- is paperwork. That's it.
You ready, ma?
I feel the same as I did on your first day of school --
Sending you out into a world
where I can't be there to take care of you.
And I was fine that day,
and I'll be fine today.
No, you came home missing a front tooth,
fighting with that Murphy boy.
Well, he started it.
Besides, that tooth was loose, anyway.
You could always take care of yourself, Jane.
Go ahead. Go and knock 'em dead.
I'm a homicide Detective, ma.
They're already dead.
Don't be a smartass.
All right.
That -- I can't move my arms. Let me go.
I know.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Janie.
Good to have you back...officially.
Yeah, we missed you.
I missed you guys.
Oh, it's good to be back.
Okay, um, did that file come in from Jacksonville?
Two motorcycles were seen leaving the area of the Tuttle murder.
Witness saw a gold stripe on the gas tank
and cowboy-style saddlebags on one.
No description of the other bike.
And I found this in the Organized Crime unit files.
What are the chances
that two motorcycles look just like that?
It depends.
Are we going to the Gold-stripe and Saddlebag store?
Henry "Blade" Vallenhurst.
Oh, he was president of the Devil's Scorpions.
I doubt burning down the wrong house
would stop him from killing Melvin.
Jacksonville Homicide said there were two motorcycles.
He had an accomplice.
So, the question is, who did he trust enough
to help him kill Melvin Tuttle?
Florida is coming for you, Blade...
...for the murder of Melvin Tuttle.
You're talking out your ass.
Well, my ass found two collect calls that you made
from a motel in Jacksonville
the same night that Melvin was murdered.
We sent your photo down to the locals.
One person identified you.
He even remembered your scorpion tattoo.
We know you didn't do it alone,
so further research turned over another collect call,
uh, from the same room, same date...from this guy.
Robert Kincade, fellow Scorpion.
He's doing 10 years in Walpole on a drug beat
because he turned down an offer to testify against you.
And he won't say anything now.
We thought the same thing.
However, we managed to convince him
what a solid case Florida had against him,
and it seems like your pal Kincade
can't really stomach the idea of 2,200 volts of electricity
popping his eyeballs out of his head.
So I made him an offer -- his life for yours.
Now, here's the thing.
I don't really care about Melvin or Kincade.
I care about the fire that killed Tanya and Becky Sullivan.
So you own up to what you did.
You confess to setting the Sullivan house on fire.
You're not following. Okay.
And as much as I hate it,
Florida can't execute you
if you're doing life here.
That damn red truck.
What were the odds?
Yeah, what were the odds?
You just have to walk me through what happened.
My father's innocent?
He's been telling the truth.
The D.A. filed a motion to overturn the verdict.
What does that mean?
That means in two days, your father will be a free man.
Okay.
Cheers.
So, is my mother boycotting my big send-off?
No, she actually went out dancing.
But she sends her love.
I'm sorry. Did you say she went dancing?
I did. She is.
Hold on.
Where? W-with who?
She didn't say.
You didn't ask?
Well, Angela is a grown woman.
Yes, but she can't be out clubbing
in the middle of the night.
It's 9:30.
Oh, Maura, don't hassle me with the details.
My mother is missing.
Okay.
I know that it's scary,
but Angela has to leave the nest and spread her wings.
That's good advice...
if we were talking about a cockatoo, which we are not.
My mother has dated two men her entire life,
both of whom I knew very well.
She doesn't know what men are like.
What if she leaves her drink unattended,
and somebody puts something in it?
I think we all know how that turns out, don't we?
I can't believe you would bring that up.
I can't believe you're not concerned about my mother.
Do I need to pull up your booking photo?
I think we both know that your mother is okay.
Yeah.
So you're just gonna wait up for her?
Well, I can't sleep now.
Well, I was going to give you a goodbye present
when you left tonight, but apparently...
You got me luggage.
They're made with three-ply durable plastic,
and they even have a ziplock and handles.
It's perfect.
I was gonna get you a stick
with a bandana on the end of it,
but then I thought that was too hobo-chic.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, should we order a pizza?
We might be waiting up for a while.
Well, you don't have to. I'm sure you're exhausted.
No, I-I doubt I could sleep either.
What time is it now?
9:36.
What time do we start calling hospitals?
Not until later -- after 10:00.
10:05.
Raising my mother's a lot harder than I thought.
