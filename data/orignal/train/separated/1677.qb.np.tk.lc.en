and now the kung pao chicken .
smooth .
and finally ,
my moo shu pork .
whoo @-@ hoo !
oh , there you have it , gentlemen .
our entire dinner unpacked by robot .
and it only took 28 minutes .
impressive , but we must be cautious .
why ?
today , it &apos;s a chinese food retrieval robot .
tomorrow , it travels back in time
and tries to kill sarah connor .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen , sheldon .
no one ever does .
that &apos;s why it happens .
hey . is the food here ?
ooh . what &apos;s that ?
that , dear lady ,
is the wolowitz programmable hand ,
designed for extravehicular repairs
on the international space station .
ah , cool .
ask me to pass the soy sauce .
oh , does that come up much on the space station ?
mostly with asian and jewish astronauts .
all right . pass the soy sauce .
coming up .
so how &apos;s work ?
oh , it &apos;s not bad .
kind of hungry .
yeah , we all are .
just wait .
you realize , penny , that the technology
that went into this arm will one day make
unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete .
really ?
they &apos;re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger ?
i thought you broke up with her .
why is she here ?
okay , here we go .
passing the soy sauce .
put out your hand .
that &apos;s amazing .
i wouldn &apos;t say amazing .
at best , it &apos;s a modest leap forward
from the basic technology that gave us country bear jamboree .
hey , sheldon ?
yes ?
peace ?
no , not peace .
hang on .
does nasa know you &apos;re using that thing as a napkin holder ?
you kidding ? they still think it &apos;s in a secure locker at jpl .
you stole it ?
borrowed .
the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it .
excuse me .
amy &apos;s at the dry cleaners ,
and she &apos;s made a very amusing pun .
&quot; i don &apos;t care for perchloroethylene ,
and i don &apos;t like glycol ether . &quot;
get it ?
she doesn &apos;t like glycol ether .
sounds like &quot; either . &quot;
&quot; l @-@ o @-@ l. &quot;
who &apos;s amy ?
his girlfriend .
sheldon has a girlfriend ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
how long has this been going on ?
four months .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
are you telling me , for the past four months
i have been asking you , &quot; what &apos;s new ? &quot;
and you never thought to go with ,
&quot; sheldon has a girlfriend &quot; ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
ah ... d @-@ d @-@ d @-@ d ...
how did they meet ?
raj and i entered sheldon &apos;s information on a dating site ,
and it spit out amy farrah fowler .
oh , my god ! sheldon and amy .
or , as we call them , &quot; shamy . &quot;
shamy .
i am so digging the shamy .
all right , everyone pay attention .
yes , i have a friend named amy farrah fowler .
yes , she is female .
yes , we communicate on a daily basis ,
but no , she is not my girlfriend .
okay , well , what do you communicate about ?
well , my work in physics , her work in neurobiology ,
and most recently , the possibility of our having a child together .
thank you .
wait a minute-- a child ?
you never see this girl .
you just e @-@ mail and text and twitter .
now you &apos;re considering having a baby ?
amy pointed out that between the two of us ,
our genetic material has the potential
of producing the first in a line
of intellectually superior , benign overlords
to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow .
i &apos;m guessing that future historians
will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill sheldon .
okay , i have a question .
yes , penny .
you don &apos;t even like people touching you .
how are you going to have sex ?
why on earth would we have sex ?
oh , honey , did your mom not have the talk with you ?
you know , when your private parts started growing ?
i &apos;m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce ,
which is messy , unsanitary ,
and based on living next to you for three years ,
involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity .
oh , god .
yes , exactly .
consequently , if amy and i choose
to bring new life into this world ,
it will be accomplished clinically ,
with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes .
which reminds me--
you have broad hips and a certain corn @-@ fed vigor .
is your womb available for rental ?
still digging the shamy ?
look , sheldon ,
before you race off to the fertility clinic ,
you might want to think about--
uh , gee , i don &apos;t know--
maybe actually spending some time with her .
you mean dating ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t date amy .
why not ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
okay , look , don &apos;t think of it as dating a girlfriend .
think of it as , uh ...
getting to know the future mother of your child .
i hadn &apos;t considered that .
i suppose she will have to have access to our progeny .
and you don &apos;t think i can achieve
the required intimacy via text messaging ?
probably not .
it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me .
penny .
penny . penny .
you do realize i stand on the other side of the door
waiting for you to finish knocking three times .
i know . i can see the shadow of your feet under the door .
yeah , my point is it &apos;s a waste of time .
if you &apos;re looking for an example
of a waste of time , i would refer you
to the conversation we &apos;re having right now .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ve decided to take your advice and have arranged
to go on a date with amy farrah fowler .
oh , that &apos;s great .
have fun .
wait .
you have to drive me .
what ?
you know i don &apos;t drive .
well , go ask leonard .
i did .
he said-- and i quote-- &quot; ask penny .
it was her cockamamy idea . &quot;
leonard said &quot; cockamamy &quot; ?
actually , i &apos;m paraphrasing .
having been raised in a christian household ,
i &apos;m uncomfortable with the language he used .
and to be honest ,
i &apos;m not entirely comfortable with &quot; cockamamy . &quot;
okay , fine . when &apos;s the date ?
now .
now ?
hurry . we &apos;re going to be late .
sheldon , did it ever occur to you
that i might have other plans ?
i &apos;m sorry .
do you have other plans ?
well , no , not per se , but ...
so this conversation is as pointless
as your door @-@ knocking soliloquy ?
let me get my ... cockamamy keys .
oh , god , that feels so good .
yeah , that &apos;s the spot .
oh , baby .
howard , dinner &apos;s ready !
i &apos;ll eat later .
i &apos;m busy !
oh , yeah .
just like a real hand .
thank you for driving me .
you &apos;re welcome .
i wish you weren &apos;t wearing flip @-@ flops .
it &apos;s dangerous to drive in flip @-@ flops .
sheldon .
sorry .
i just don &apos;t want to be yet another flip @-@ flop fatality .
can i ask you a question ?
given your community college education ,
i encourage you to ask me as many as possible .
yeah . well , my question is--
and i &apos;m pretty sure i know the answer--
is this your first date ?
that depends .
does square @-@ dancing with my sister
at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown
count as a date ?
no .
then , this is my first date .
okay . well , then , there &apos;s a couple of things
you should probably know .
i have a master &apos;s degree and two doctorates .
the things i should know , i do know .
my point is , i know more about dating than you ,
and if you were as smart as you think you are ,
you would listen to me .
if you know so much , how come i have a date tonight
and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it ?
fair point .
you know , there &apos;s something i &apos;ve always wondered about aquaman .
yeah ?
where does he poop ?
what ?
what would a toilet look like in atlantis ?
how would you flush it ?
and when you did flush it , where would the poop go ?
hold that thought .
hey , howard . what &apos;s going on ?
what ...
hold on . howard , howard , slow down .
the robot hand is stuck on your what ?
you &apos;re not going to believe this .
so , um , amy , sheldon tells me
you &apos;re a neuro ... something @-@ or @-@ other .
neurobiologist .
your &quot; check engine &quot; light is on .
yeah , it &apos;s okay .
but the light indicates ...
don &apos;t bother .
i &apos;ve wasted many an hour
tilting at that particular windmill .
uh , what is that scent you &apos;re wearing ?
it smells great .
dandruff shampoo .
i have dry scalp .
well , your hair looks very nice .
are you a homosexual ?
no , no , i &apos;m just giving you a compliment .
would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual .
guys , how &apos; bout some music ?
oh , no , i wouldn &apos;t care for that .
amy ?
no , thank you .
okay .
uncomfortable silence it is .
hey , sheldon , have you told amy
what it was like for you growing up in texas ?
no .
well , why don &apos;t you tell her ?
all right .
it was hell .
any follow up , amy ?
no .
i myself grew up in nebraska .
small town outside of omaha .
nice place , mostly family farms , a few meth labs .
i &apos;m sorry , how is this better than uncomfortable silence ?
i don &apos;t know . i was just trying something .
muggles .
you slipped and fell into a robot hand ?
yes .
penis first ?
yes . now , help me !
i &apos;d suggest a lubricant , but i have a feeling
you fell on some of that as well .
not funny , leonard .
really ? a robot hand &apos;s got a death grip on your junk , dude .
that &apos;s funny , ask anyone .
plea-- before my mother walks in , get this off me !
okay , let &apos;s see .
no , no ! don &apos;t touch .
the program is paused .
well , then let &apos;s un @-@ pause it .
no , no ! i loaded the wrong program .
the hand thinks it &apos;s holding a screwdriver in outer space .
if you continue the program , it &apos;s gonna start twisting .
a @-@ all right .
um , how about this .
when @-@ when winnie the pooh got his head stuck
in the honey tree , his friends all grabbed onto him
and pulled and pulled .
you do what you want ,
i &apos;m not touching another man &apos;s honey tree .
all right , uh , forget pulling .
how about we get an electric saw and cut it off ?
what ? ! no saws !
one circumcision was enough .
how about an acetylene torch ?
okay , i can &apos;t believe this needs to be said out loud .
no pulling , no saws , no torches .
well , then what do you want us to do ?
howard , i made cookies for you
and your little friends !
that &apos;s great , mom , thanks !
i &apos;ll bring them up with some hawaiian punch !
don &apos;t come up here !
why not ? ! are you ashamed of your mother ? !
yes , but that &apos;s not the point !
get me out of here .
you have any ideas , raj ?
right now , all i can think about is cookies and hawaiian punch .
hey , here &apos;s another possible topic of conversation .
this is a big night for sheldon .
right , sheldon ?
big night ?
the winter solstice is a big night .
it &apos;s over 14 hours
in southern california .
that &apos;s an amusing factoid .
thank you .
no , no .
my point is , uh , tonight is sheldon &apos;s first official date .
discuss .
is this true ?
apparently , a semi @-@ incestuous teens for jesus
fourth of july hoedown didn &apos;t count .
so , um , amy , what about you ?
do you date much ?
once a year .
it &apos;s a deal i made with my mother
in exchange for her silence on the matter ,
as well as the occasional use of her george foreman grill
that seals in the flavor without the fat .
how about you , penny ?
do you go on many dates ?
uh , yeah , i wouldn &apos;t say many .
a few .
what &apos;s ... ?
your characterization of approximately 171 different men as &quot; a few . &quot;
what ...
where did you get 171 men ?
simple extrapolation .
in the three years that i &apos;ve known you ,
you were single for two .
during that time , i saw 17 different suitors .
if we work backwards , correcting for observation bias
and postulate an initial dating age of 15
whoa , wait , wait , wait .
i did not start dating at 15 .
i &apos;m sorry . sixteen ?
fourteen .
my mistake .
now , assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present ,
that would bring the total up to 193 men .
plus or minus eight men .
remarkable .
did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men ?
no .
although that number would be fairly easy to calculate .
based on the number of awkward encounters i &apos;ve had
with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning ,
plus the number of times she &apos;s returned home wearing the same clothes
she wore the night before ...
okay , sheldon , i think you &apos;ve made your point .
so we multiply 193--
minus 21 men before the loss of virginity--
so 172 times 0.18 gives us ...
30.96 sexual partners .
let &apos;s round that up to 31 .
okay , sheldon , you are so wrong .
that is not even close to the real number .
i &apos;m gonna need a drink over here .
this is very interesting .
cultural perceptions are subjective .
penny , to your mind , are you a slut ?
no ! no !
no .
let &apos;s just all finish our dinners , okay ?
this is an interesting topic .
how many sexual encounters have you had ?
does volunteering for a scientific experiment
in which orgasm was achieved by electronically
stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count ?
i should think so .
then 128 .
okay , come on .
almost there .
don &apos;t tug .
no tugging .
next time , take your own advice .
excuse me , could you help us out ?
my , my , my .
what do we have here ?
i slipped and fell .
yeah , we get that a lot .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a robot arm .
where &apos;s the rest of the robot ?
i only built the arm .
&apos;cause that &apos;s all you needed , right ?
can you please just help me ? !
all right , all right .
hang on , stay calm .
i need an orderly with a wheelchair .
i got a robot hand grasping a man &apos;s penis out here .
you think you could be a little more discreet ?
i &apos;m sorry , we don &apos;t have a code for &quot; robot hand grasping a man &apos;s penis . &quot;
why is it hooked up to a computer ?
uh , it &apos;s what controls the arm .
but it &apos;s frozen .
did you try turning it off and back on again ?
no , you see , it &apos;s more complicated than that .
no , wait !
winnie the pooh is out of the honey tree .
now can we have cookies and hawaiian punch ?
you were right .
this was a very productive evening .
i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight .
i did not have sex with 31 guys .
i &apos;ll be happy to check the math , but numbers don &apos;t lie , penny .
in any event , now that amy and i have spent quality time together ,
i feel much more confident
proceeding to the next stage of our relationship .
and that is ?
using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus
to gift humanity with our progeny .
you &apos;re still on that ?
in these uncertain times , doesn &apos;t humanity deserve a gift ?
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna come at this in a whole new way .
sheldon , if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish ,
i &apos;m gonna tell your mother on you .
that &apos;s no threat .
my mother &apos;s always wanted a grandchild .
really ? your deeply religious born @-@ again christian mother
wants a test @-@ tube grandbaby born out of wedlock ?
curses .
if i &apos;d thought of that in the first place ,
i could &apos;ve saved myself this whole night .
well , it &apos;s not that late .
you could still go out and look for number 32 .
good night .
hey , howard , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve decided not to procreate .
yeah , yeah , great .
howard , uh , slow down .
