he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle
but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight
&quot; merry christmas to all and to all a good night . &quot;
wow ! that was great ! you really wrote that ?
uh @-@ huh
say goodbye , elves . i &apos;m off to tulsa .
i can &apos;t believe you won &apos;t be here for christmas .
you &apos;re really not coming back ?
we have this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year .
why can &apos;t those dumb tulsa people do the work ?
because those dumb people got everything dumped on them ..
by the arrogant jerks in the new york office .
i &apos;m caught between two worlds .
if i don &apos;t get it done , i &apos;ll be fired .
it &apos;s so unfair .
you don &apos;t even like your job .
so . who does ?
i like my job .
i love my job .
i can &apos;t wait to go back to work .
i can &apos;t get enough dinosaurs .
i &apos;m sorry i won &apos;t be here .
it &apos;s hard enough not seeing you during the week ..
but for christmas ..
if this is what you have to do , i understand .
thanks .
i &apos;ll see you new year &apos;s day .
you &apos;re not gonna be here new year &apos;s eve ?
did i not mention that ?
no .
and to all a good night !
the.one.with.christmas.in.tulsa
all right , everybody . i know it is christmas eve ..
and you &apos;d rather be with family , but there is no call for writing ..
&quot; screw you , mr. bing &quot; on the back of my chair .
by the way , you can all call me chandler .
hey .
hey . where you been ?
i was checking out that insurance company &apos;s christmas party on three .
it was really beautiful . they have decorations and this huge tree .
and i just thought , to hell with them , we have to work .
so i stole their ham .
hear that ? you may not be with your families ..
but at least it &apos;s gonna smell like ham in here .
my kid &apos;s in a play right now .
you know what ? i know what will cheer you up .
i had a talk with the boys in new york . i told them about all your hard work ..
and that a little christmas bonus may be in order .
&quot; a donation has been made in your name
to the new york city ballet . &quot;
well , that &apos;s like money in your pocket .
all right , you want me to say it ? this sucks .
being here sucks . this work sucks !
now it feels like christmas .
i &apos;m sorry .
at least you get to go home and be with your families tonight .
i have to go to an empty hotel room and lay down ..
on a very questionable bedspread .
then tomorrow , you get to have christmas in your own houses .
which , by the way , none of you have invited me to .
you can come to my house .
no , thanks .
it was a nice pep talk .
thanks .
i &apos;m actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker .
so if you were home right now , what would you be doing ?
typical christmassy stuff , you know . our holidays are pretty traditional .
so here &apos;s a very special holiday song ..
that i wrote for some very important people to me .
went to the store sat on santa &apos;s lap
asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap
said all you need is to write them a song
now you haven &apos;t heard it yet so don &apos;t try to sing along
no , don &apos;t sing along
monica , monica have a happy hannukah
saw santa claus
he said hello to ross
and please tell joey
christmas will be snowy
and rachel and chandler
happy holidays , everybody .
phoebe , look in the kitchen . i &apos;ll look in the back closet .
i can save you time , ladies . i &apos;m right here .
yeah . chandler , why don &apos;t you take a walk .
this doesn &apos;t concern you .
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica .
what ? that &apos;s terrible .
no , no . we do it every year .
well , that makes it not terrible .
no . yeah , we never find them . she &apos;s always bested us , that wily ..
minx .
we &apos;re gonna search here for an hour ..
and then we &apos;ll go to joey &apos;s and search . okay ?
no , not okay . you can &apos;t look for monica &apos;s presents .
no , we have to .
no , you don &apos;t have to .
and you can &apos;t , because i live here too .
well , then you should look with us .
why ?
aren &apos;t you worried about what to get monica for christmas ?
no , i have a great idea for a present for her .
that &apos;s it ? &quot; a great idea &quot; ?
that &apos;s not enough . what if she gets you a great present ..
two medium presents and lots of little presents ..
and you got her one great present ? that &apos;s gonna make her feel bad .
why would you do that to her ? why ? why ?
if i helped , we could find them faster !
right .
we have a live one !
it &apos;s a macy &apos;s bag !
who &apos;s it for ?
&quot; dear losers : do you really think i &apos;d hide presents under the couch ?
p.s. chandler , i knew they &apos;d break you . &quot;
rach , these are for you .
wiper blades . i don &apos;t even have a car .
no , but with this new @-@ car smell , you &apos;ll think you do .
okay , phoebe , your turn .
toilet seat covers !
is that what you were doing while i was getting gas ?
you guys .
and for ross , mr. sweet tooth .
you got me a cola drink ?
and .. a lemon @-@ lime !
well , this .. this is too much .
i feel like i should get you another sweater .
and last but not least ..
they &apos;re ribbed , for your pleasure .
well , hey , ben ?
what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ?
cool !
come on , ben .
years and years ago , there were these people called the maccabees !
merry christmas !
santa !
what are you doing here , santa ?
well , i &apos;m here to see my old buddy ben .

you sent me here to give ben some presents .
remember ?
what ?
ben , why don &apos;t you open some more presents .
santa , the armadillo and i will have a talk in the kitchen .
there &apos;s a sentence i never thought i &apos;d say .
what are you doing ?
you called and said you had trouble finding a santa costume ..
so i borrowed one from a guy at work .
thank you , but you gotta leave .
why ?
because ..
i &apos;m finally getting him excited about hanukkah .
and you &apos;re wrecking it .
but i didn &apos;t get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly .
i &apos;m sorry , chandler , but this is really important to me .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll give the suit back .
hey , you think you can keep it another night ?
santa ? really ?
yeah , is that okay ?
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?
no .
then it &apos;s okay !
you know what , everybody ?
go home . you should be with your families .
it &apos;s bad enough we &apos;re working new year &apos;s eve .

all right , look , go . go home , okay ? merry christmas .
merry christmas .
peace on earth .
bye .
good . godspeed , good people .
you &apos;re not gonna go ?
no . i couldn &apos;t leave you alone .

chandler bing .
hi , honey . we &apos;re all here .
we want to wish you a merry christmas .
merry christmas !
merry christmas !
merry christmas . i miss you guys .
so is it horrible ? is everybody working really hard ?
well , no , it &apos;s just me and wendy .
wendy ? that sounds like a girl &apos;s name .
it is . did i not tell you about her ?
about the time you told me about new year &apos;s eve .
where &apos;s everybody else ?
i sent them home .
you are such a good boss . is she pretty ?
answer faster . answer faster .
i don &apos;t know .
answer better . answer better .
i don &apos;t think of her that way . i mean , she &apos;s a colleague .
what does she do there ?
she &apos;s regional vice president .
she &apos;s just below me .
she did what ?
below me .
wait , is wendy the runner @-@ up miss oklahoma ?
what ? !
well , she didn &apos;t win .
all right , maybe i should let you ..
and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work .
second prettiest that year . of all the girls in oklahoma , she &apos;s probably ..
chandler , stop talking .
honey , there &apos;s really nothing to worry about .
okay .
i &apos;m serious .
okay .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas , you guys .
merry christmas .
the wife says hi .
fun conversation ?
well , she &apos;s just got this weird idea that ..
because you and i are alone something &apos;s gonna happen .
really ?
would that be so terrible ?
this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about ..
but you &apos;re getting ham on my only tie .
back off , missy !
missy ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not used to girls making passes at me .
wait a minute . am i sexy in oklahoma ?
you are to me .
no . no . no !
look , i &apos;m married .
so ? i &apos;m married .
i &apos;m happily married .
what &apos;s that like ?
right . so i &apos;m sorry , but ..
seriously ? happily married ?
so that phone call before , that was happy ?
well , look , it &apos;s not easy to spend this much time apart .
she &apos;s entitled to be a little paranoid .
or , in this case , right on the money .
you know , she &apos;s amazing and beautiful and smart .
and if she were here right now , she &apos;d kick your ass .
look , you &apos;re a really nice person , ham @-@ stealing and adultery aside .
but what i have with my wife is pretty great .
so nothing &apos;s ever gonna happen between us .
okay , let me ask you something .
if what you and your wife have is so great ..
then why are you spending christmas with me ?
you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight .
really ?
are you kidding ?
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in most rooms .
what &apos;s going on ? you and i just made out .
you and i are making out ?
well , not anymore .
but we don &apos;t do that .
i know . i just thought it would be fun .
how drunk are you ?
drunk enough that i wanna do this .
not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage .
that &apos;s a perfect amount .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
what ?
this doesn &apos;t feel weird .
i know .
you &apos;re a really good kisser .
well , i have kissed over four women .
you wanna get under the covers ? okay .
wow , you are really fast .
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .
we &apos;re gonna see each other naked .
yep .
you want to do it at the same time ?
count of three ?
one .
two .
three .
well , i think it &apos;s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .
we weren &apos;t that close anyway .
are you really gonna go out with that nurse @-@ man ?
well , you and i are just goofing around .
i thought , why not just goof around with him ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever looked up &quot; goofing around &quot; in the dictionary .
well , i have .
and the technical definition is two friends ..
who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex ..
and just want to spend more time together .
if you have this newfangled dictionary that gets you mad at me ..
then we have to , you know , get you my original dictionary .
i am so bad at this .
i think you &apos;re better than you think you are .
really ? okay . so if .. ?
know when to stop .
i sensed that i should stop .
so we &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
don &apos;t do the dance .
right .
i can &apos;t get married without something old , something new ..
something borrowed , something blue .
okay , okay .
here &apos;s something blue and new .
you are so efficient . i love you .
let &apos;s go .
no , no , wait !
we need something old .
okay . i have a condom in my wallet that i &apos;ve had since i was 12 .
that &apos;ll work !
i don &apos;t think so .
okay . now we just need something borrowed .
here , just take this .
that &apos;s stealing .
we &apos;ll bring it back . just put it under your dress .
okay , one thing at a time .
listen ..
i &apos;ve been thinking .
it &apos;s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .
i mean , you work .. you work really hard for that .
well ..
well , you work for that .
look , i &apos;ve thought about it too . and ..
i &apos;m sorry . i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
you do ?
yeah . i &apos;m putting my foot down .
yeah , look , when i proposed ..
i told you that i would do anything to make you happy .
and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy , then ..
then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
you are so sweet .
but wait . what about our .. ? what about the future and stuff ?
forget about the future and stuff . so we only have two kids .
you know , we &apos;ll pick our favorite , and that one will get to go to college .
you &apos;ve thought about that ?
yeah .
how many kids were we gonna have ?
four . a boy , twin girls ..
and another boy .
what else did you think about ?
well ..
stuff like where we &apos;d live , you know .
like a small place outside the city where our kids could ride bikes and stuff .
and we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar ..
and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .
we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t .. i don &apos;t want a big , fancy wedding .
sure you do .
no .
i want everything that you &apos;ve just said .
i want a marriage .
you sure ?
i love you so much .
i love you .
i love it !
really ? you &apos;re not gonna return it ?
well , not this second .
hey , look , you guys . it &apos;s snowing !
wow , it &apos;s so beautiful .
wow , it really is .
wendy &apos;s a fat @-@ girl name .
aren &apos;t we done with that ?
okay , fine . fine . let &apos;s talk about snow .
do you think it &apos;s snowing in tulsa where my husband &apos;s having sex on a copier ?
hey .
oh , my god .
look at that . that &apos;s a christmas miracle !
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to be with you .
i missed you so much .
hey , hey . who &apos;d you miss the most ?
monica .
gotcha .
i never want to leave you again .
i thought if you left , you &apos;d get fired .
turns out they can &apos;t fire me . because i quit .
what ?
what ? you .. ? you really quit your job ?
yeah . it was a stupid job , and i could not stand leaving you .
why should i be the only one who doesn &apos;t do what he really wants to do ?
well , what do you really wanna do ?
i have not thought this through .
oh , my god .
i know . i should &apos;ve talked to you first .
no , i think that this is what you wanna do . i think it &apos;s great !
thanks .
chandler , your being here is the best christmas present i could ever imagine .
now give me my real gift .
yeah .
thank you .
here , pass those around .
&quot; a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet . &quot;
how did you know ?
what ? are you kidding ? i can &apos;t return this .
it &apos;s time we started thinking about other people .
and besides , this gift still says , &quot; i love you guys . &quot;
mine says , &quot; to lillian myers . &quot;
i don &apos;t have a job .
actuary ? no .
bookkeeper ? no .
topless dancer ?
hey , you know what i just realized ? you are the sole wage earner .
you are the head of the household . i don &apos;t do anything . i &apos;m a kept man !
you are .
honey , here &apos;s 20 bucks .
