Kyle.
Where's Paige?
Everybody inside!
Hands up.
Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!
You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Have a seat.
So the Attorney General has announced
a first of its kind comprehensive review
of every serial criminal in federal prison.
Ok.
And he wants you to supervise and coordinate the team.
Congratulations.
Uh...Um, I've--eh--
I'm just gonna hyperventilate for a moment,
So if I could just have--
ok, well--well, when?
When--when does he need it?
It's ambitious. He says it's all gonna happen in a year
and you'd need to start immediately.
You'd have to leave the BAU.
No. Oh. I--
No, I came here for a reason.
I love what we do.
I don't want to leave.
But it's a great opportunity.
Why don't you take some time to think about it?
Don't go.
Garcia?
I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't--
I wasn't eavesdropping. Official business.
What is that?
Uh--oh, it's-- it's fresh off the wire.
There's a single murder, but they think that single murder
is super significant because the field office email
said "Urgent" like 3 times.
This is in Glenport Village.
What's in Glenport Village.
Uh, Glenport Village is a planned community of sex offenders.
I wrote the psychological questionnaire that Reverend Santos uses
to choose the residents.
Planned community of sex offenders? You're serious?
Glenport Village, Florida, houses a wide spectrum
of non-violent offenders,
crimes ranging from statutory rape
to public urination in front of children.
No rapists or murderers until now.
Well, I can tell you one thing.
Reverend Santos and his community are dedicated to reform.
It says here he went to jail at 18 for impregnating
his 15-year-old girlfriend.
Yes, but no offenses since and 40 years and two children later,
they're still happily married.
Am I reading this right? Families with kids live there?
The law requires sexual offenders to live certain distances
from bus stops, playgrounds, and schools,
But it says nothing about being their neighbors.
In most cities that's a legal oversight, but in this one,
it was part of the design plan
Look, here's some context. In 2009, Reverend Santos
was able to buy up a few homes in Barclay Bay using church funds.
Now, the real estate was already inexpensive in this area,
but when surrounding residents found out
that he planned to house sex offenders,
there was a mass exodus,
so eventually he was able to buy up the rest of the homes
and then rename the town.
Will he cooperate with us?
He's already sending us files on all the residents,
past and present.
This community is a fascinating experiment.
Typically when sex offenders
try to reintegrate into society,
they're rejected, they're isolated.
But this community, sick of the harassment,
decided to self-isolate.
Well, that experiment just backfired.
Yeah, in a massive way.
Two nights ago authorities found
the body of Paige Lincoln in her bathroom.
She was stabbed in the chest and the stomach.
Yeah, I'm just shocked
that the Reverend didn't call me immediately.
Well, they had a suspect right away--
her husband, Kyle Lincoln.
He was covered in her blood,
but his alibi checked out this morning,
and the blood was because he was trying to resuscitate her.
And now we have a two-day-old crime scene
and a town full of suspects.
Wheels up in 30.

It's all the way down the block.
What are you, scared?
No.
Yes, you are.
Maggie, wait!
"I swear, from the bottom of my heart,
I want to be healed, I want to be like other men,
not this outcast who nobody wants."
E.M. Forster.
The victim, Paige Lincoln, was a high school teacher
caught making out with a student.
She moved to Glenport Village shortly thereafter,
met her husband Kyle, who's an offender there,
and by all accounts, their marriage was stable.
She was found in a cheerleader outfit
that according to her Amazon purchases, she bought.
Must have been her husband's fantasy.
Well, according to her history, it could be hers.
I mean, is that why she was killed?
Maybe she was having an affair.
Well, if Paige was looking for guys who were into cheerleaders,
this town was a good place to start.
I know this preacher, ok? These aren't bad people.
Just because this happened here doesn't mean a resident did it.
We just need to keep all of our options open.
She's right. This isn't a prison or military base.
People move in and out freely.
What if this was a vendetta kill
committed by a victim of a Glenport Village resident?
Revenge is a good motivator.
Garcia's tracking outside threats.
When we land, Lewis and I will go talk to the reverend.
Dave, you go to the M.E.
Morgan, you and Reid go talk to Paige's husband.
Mr. Lincoln, we need to ask you some personal questions.
Are you sure that you're up to this?
Yeah, it's fine.
Just... Just get it over with.
The cheerleader costume.
We know Paige bought it.
Was that role play something that she was into, or...
No, I...
It was my thing.
Who else would have known that?
Nobody.
Look, why is this so important?
The man who killed Paige dressed her up before he took her life.
So either he has the same role playing preference you do...
or he's trying to frame you with it.
Do you see where we're going with this?
Sometimes I'd...
I'd want her to have it on when I got home.
I'd text her. Only it wasn't a text,
it was a...
Internet relay chat.
It's like a text, only--
IRC self-deletes when you close the window.
Exactly.
Why would you need so much privacy?
You haven't met the reverend, have you?
That's everyone, Tara.
All 1,922 citizens.
You'll find case histories, probationary reports,
hopefully everything you need.
Great. Thanks, Reverend.
I just wish we were meeting again under better circumstances.
Did anyone have any issues with the Lincoln family, Reverend?
No one has much trouble with anyone here.
Ever?
I took your ideas
and I instituted a couple of my own.
Ask the sheriff about how successful we've been.
Well, I'm surprised, but he's right.
20 years of police work,
this is the quietest beat I've ever had.
How have you accomplished that?
There's an application process?
It's intense.
And what happens once you get in?
The residents all sign contracts.
We're about transparency.
Reverend, we worked together for 6 years with no issues.
Why hide this?
Paul, it's not personal,
but we can self-police better than you.
What happened two nights ago was a tragedy,
but it's also the first violent crime in 6 years.
That's well below the national average, I believe.
Exactly what do residents agree to in these contracts?
It's a tracking chip.
It's surgically implanted.
And the reverend makes you wear it?
Hiding a contract from me is one thing, but a tracker?
That does seem extreme, Reverend.
Nobody's coerced.
If they don't like it, they can leave.
Can the chip be removed?
Yes, and if they try without my approval,
I'm notified.
But that's never happened.
Do you have one?
Don't need it.
My incident was decades ago.
Look, if a resident lives here without trouble for 5 years,
I take theirs out as well.
A contract. A tracker.
That's quite the secret playbook, Reverend.
Everything is done in the name our our protection.
How accurate is the gps on those trackers?
It's down to 3 feet.
That data's a good starting point.
We could begin with the whereabouts of every resident
in the community with a tracker.
Who was in the Lincoln house the night of the murder, Reverend?
I've been working on that since you landed.
C.O.D was exsanguination caused by
stab wounds to the abdomen and chest.
Hell of a lot of overkill.
This looks personal. Defensive wounds?
Across her palms and forearms.
Any hesitation marks?
None.
It's probably not his first time.
What about sexual assault?
No obvious signs.
If he's in CODIS,
he might not risk it.
The costume is covered in the victim's blood,
but there aren't any knife perforations in the fabric.
So he dressed her postmortem.
Yes.
This unsub needs a compliant victim
to proceed with his fantasy.
The problem is, a live one isn't.
All right, thanks, Lewis.
Randy Nelson, the Lincolns' neighbor.
He seems to be the only one in the house that day
with a tracker.
According to the reverend, he's here for flashing married women.
Paige fits that victimology.
The question is, would Randy dress her as a cheerleader?
Let's take him in and find out.
Here's some money. Bring back the change, all right?
Oh, Agent Hotchner. Danny, come here.
These are my kids. This is Riley.
Hi, Riley.
Hi.
And this is Danny.
Danny. How do you do?
Can we go now?
Yeah, sure.
Riley, straight home after you finish shopping,
All right, riley?
I know.
Sorry about that.
It hasn't been easy.
They, uh, they came here after my ex-wife passed
6 months ago.
You got kids?
One. A 10-year-old boy.
Oh, I'm in over my head.
We live 5 miles outside of Glenport Village,
but the place still informs every parental decision I make.
Sure.
Especially on a day like this.
This place sucks.
First we move into my dad's so late in the year
that I miss cheer tryouts,
then the AP chem is boring.
Southville is the worst.
I like it. I mean, I get to play soccer.
And dad's here.
God, you're so simple.
No, I get it. I mean, you miss your old neighborhood.
You have no idea.
No offense.
No, no, none taken.
So, I, um, I heard about this party tonight at Greg's.
I-I can get us in.
You can get us in?
Probably. I mean, I'll try.
Oh, it's not gonna matter 'cause my dad won't let me go.
Well, why not?
Look who the neighbors are.
You were friends with Paige?
I was, yes.
For how long?
Years. 3, maybe, yeah.
She was the only one in Glenport Village who was nice to me.
How come?
That's just how it is, even in a town like this.
Randy, come have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.
You're not under arrest.
Here's the thing, Randy.
The guy who did this,
he was into cheerleaders.
Well, I'm not.
Maybe the killer just wants us to believe that he is.
I don't know about any of this.
You were in Paige's house at 3 P.M. that afternoon.
You have a history with housewives.
But here's the strange thing.
Our analyst went through your internet history.
Not a single trace of porn,
of any kind.
The others use it as a safety valve,
a way to release pressure.
I manage fine without that.
Well, it's possible. Or maybe you're just better at hiding it.
No, you're wrong.
My life's an open book.
You're looking at it.
Randy, what I'm looking at is each of the women you flashed...
were mothers.
And each of them was in the company
of their grade-school-age son when you did it.
Now, that school bus drops off Tommy Gannon every afternoon.
He lives right next door to Paige,
and he's 8 years old.
That's why you go over for coffee, isn't it,
to watch him.
No. Absolutely not.
Randy, those women were never your targets.
Their children were.
And if the reverend finds out that you're a pedophile,
you can't live here anymore.
And that is why Paige was your only friend,
because you couldn't afford
to let anybody else know what you were into.
I tried to stop.
Please, I'm sorry.
Randy,
we have to tell the reverend and the sheriff about this.
No. No, please.
What do you two want for dinner tonight?
I don't know.
Danny?
Burgers!
No, gross, we had burgers twice this week.
Ah, well, maybe I'll do up them potatoes y'all like?
Dad.
What? Last summer you loved them.
No, it's fine.
I still like them.
Here you go.
Why don't we just order a pizza or something?
Danny, is that ok with you?
Yeah, fine.
You have homework tonight?
AP Chem.
Book report.
Hey, Matt!
Sheriff.
Hey, Riley, will you, uh,
will you look over Danny's work tonight?
Sure.
So, dad...
Um, there's this party tonight.
Everybody will be there. Can I go?
Where is it?
Not far.
But like in the total opposite direction
from Glenport Village.
Ok.
What?!
What?!
But you can't leave until I'm back from my rounds.
Someone needs to be here with Danny.
Yeah, ok.
And home by 10:30.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Yeah. You're the best dad ever.
You let her do anything she wants.
Hey, didn't I let you play video games
this morning before school?
Yeah.
So finish your homework. You can play more tonight, ok?
Ok.
See you later.
Bye, Victoria.
Bye, Vickie.
Here name's Victoria Taylor.
She was a senior at Cove High.
An honor student and cheerleader.
Sorry, my, uh, daughter went to a football game
at their school last week.
She was killed in uniform. No postmortem dressing.
Different victimology. Different M.O.
We got two killers here?
What if the unsub's showing his true colors?
Paige was the surrogate, Victoria his ideal.
One he probably spent weeks trying to find.
Location also narrows down our suspect pool.
How do you figure?
We're 10 miles from Glenport Village.
That eliminates anyone with a tracking device.
Sheriff, round up your men.
We're ready to deliver the profile.
Based on the age of everyone without a chip,
we are searching for a man in his late 30s to early 40s.
In addition to them, we're also looking at residents
from nearby communities.
Regardless of location, this unsub is experienced,
organized, and worst of all, he is patient.
He has practiced extreme self-control to sublimate his desires.
Frequent precursor crimes to this kind of fetishized murder
include peeping and petty larceny
of object like undergarments.
Now, this guy's probably fantasized and obsessed
over these murders for years.
Now that he's gotten a taste, he's gonna want to keep killing
and will take increased risks to do so.
As is evidenced by another murder on the heels of the first
and under the nose of police and federal investigators.
This guy gets off on the thrill as much as the killing.
125 residents have had their chips removed,
but remember, it's possible that the unsub is not from here.
Our analyst is searching for suspects outside of the community.
With your help we'll be
interviewing those residents without trackers.
Thank you.
I hear you have a big decision to make.
Yeah. One of the biggest of my life.
Once a year, on my birthday,
I go visit this killer in prison.
His idea, not mine, believe me.
He's the only one who knows where the bodies are buried.
He gives me a name,
and I give a family some peace and closure.
But every time I sit across from him,
treating him like a human being,
it takes something out of me.
You can do something I can't do.
I think that's why the brass tapped you for this project.
It takes something out of me, too.
The scary thing is,
sometimes I don't even notice it
till long after it's gone.
You know, this job ain't all milk and honey.
Some days you lose.
Some days you do things you don't want to do.
So ask yourself this--
Where can you do the most good
and still do yourself the least harm?
Then make your decision.
My whole life is here, man.
I got no reason to leave, except for my job.
You recently missed several days of work. Why was that?
Got doctors.
Back doctor, knee doctor, neck doctor.
poked and prodded all damn day.
And I got the paperwork and the needle marks to prove it.
So, where were you the last two nights?
I was at home.
Are those Blundstones?
Yes, they are.
Anybody to confirm your whereabouts?
My mom. Do you wear an E?
How about I boot you in the ass
and then you can tell me.
Those are copies of my receipts for the last week.
Restaurant, pharmacy.
Nothing exciting.
It's gone, isn't it?
What is?
Our home.
We can't stay.
And there's nowhere else we can build something like this.
Reverend, when we find the guy did this--
It doesn't matter.
You know, we had 16 protests here last year?
Parents come by, yell at us
and throw rocks through the windows.
But they don't know these men and women the way I do,
the way you do.
Nobody here did this, but they won't believe that.
Now our home is gone.
No. No, after this is all over, you can rebuild.
What if I was wrong about everything?
I mean, in building this, I made us easier targets?
Reverend,
without you, these people would have nowhere to go.
And if it hadn't been for me,
Paige would still be alive.
All the residents checked out, didn't they?
Every single one, with or without the tracking chip.
Ok. Where does that leave us?
You know, the reverend said something that got me thinking.
This town is the perfect forensic countermeasure.
The unsub would have known
we'd start investigating inside the circle,
And that's exactly what we did.
To take advantage of that,
this guy would have to be an outsider.
Yeah. Garcia, how are you doing investigating people
in the surrounding communities?
Well, it's still in its early stages.
The list is long and rather arduous.
It's no big shocker, there's a lot of people out there
who have vendettas against Glenport Village.
All right, there is one name that keeps cropping up.
Ira Stein. He lives right by Glenport Village.
He has been quite vocal about his dislike of the community.
He's been arrested twice for harassing residents.
I'll go talk to Ira. Thanks.
While you do, we need to take another look.
There's something or someone we missed.
Sheriff, can you give us a hand?
Of course. One second, Agent Lewis. Hey, guys.
Dad, can one of the deputies show me how to fire a gun?
We'll see, buddy. Come on.
What are we doing here?
'cause we're all spending the night in my office.
I call couch!
What? Why?
Dad, what about the party?
I'm sorry, Riley.
That is so unfair. You told me I could go.
Hey, Danny, why don't you, uh, get yourself some food
from the vending machine.
Sure.
Victoria Taylor-- you know her?
No. But I heard.
I need to make sure you two are safe.
So you're making me and Danny literally rot in a prison?
Come on, Riley. It's one night,
And I need you to watch over your brother.
Dad, this is insane.
Our house is a fortress.
I mean, there are more guns at home than there are here.
Besides, you know someone from perv ville did this.
No, I don't. Not necessarily.
All I know for sure is whoever this is
has gone outside Glenport Village.
Now, please, Riley, help me do my job, ok?
Just one night.
Fine.
Hey, Adam.
Hey, can you go out?
No. I'm at my dad's work.
Oh. Well, we, uh, we got invited to Greg's party.
We did?
My dad's got me on lockdown.
Can you sneak out?
Doubt it.
Doesn't matter. I don't have a car.
Oh, I'll pick you up.
You will?
Yeah, of course. Just meet me outside the station in 20.
Ok.
Hey, Danny.
Dad says you can't go.
I'll only be gone an hour. Two, max.
My silence isn't free.
How much?
Two weeks with your computer.
Rossi hit a dead end with Ira Stein,
but the the reverend said it himself--
the reason the crime rate is so low in Glenport village
is because the people there self-police.
So someone there had to have seen the unsub.
Wouldn't they come forward for the good of the community?
The residents are like us. They watch, they profile.
The thing is, they didn't realize they saw him.
Well, in that case, who's the most likely resident that did?
I have an idea.
Thanks for coming to get me.
I felt like the walls were closing in.
Yeah, no problem.
Wasn't that Greg's?
Yeah. Looks like there's no party.
Hmm. Maybe he got busted.
You know, uh, that's ok, 'cause,
you know, I was thinking that maybe...
Uh...You know, I should probably just get back to my dad's work.
No, that's ok, we're cool.
Damn it, Adam!
Look, just take me back to the station--now.
You know what? You can walk home.
Are you kidding me?
Get out.
Get out!
Where's your sister?
She left.
What, she left?!
She said she'd be back in an hour.
Two, max.
Riley's phone, leave a message.
Danny, don't you move, all right?
Hey, Riley.
Hey, Matt, is that you?
Yeah. What's going on?
Uh, Greg's party got broken up.
Oh, well, you know, there was an after party at Michelle's.
Um, heh, sorry you missed it.
Hey, you need a ride?
Uh...Yeah.
Uh, sorry, the seatbelt's broken.
Oh, no worries. We're not going far.
I never should have left the station.
My dad's gonna be mad.
Thanks for taking me back.
Oh, uh, actually, the station's that way.
Oh, I know.
Yeah, but it's the other way.
Matt?
No, you're wrong, I didn't see anybody.
Agent, I need your help.
Sure.
Randy, you were the last person to see Paige alive.
Yes.
Ok.
So take me through your day.
Tommy's bus dropped him off after school.
You watched him through Paige's window.
Then what happened?
I walked back home.
Ok. What did you do then?
Sometimes Tommy plays outside...
And I, uh, get a good look at him.
He doesn't have any friends.
It's not his fault.
Who'd let their child
come over for a playdate in Glenport village?
Tommy must be lonely.
Did he come outside that day?
No.
You would have been hyper-focused on looking for him,
so any movement would have caught your eye.
What did you see?
Just a car.
What kind of car?
I don't know. It's just a car.
Play it over in your mind slowly.
Is there anything about the car that stood out?
It was gray.
There, uh, there was a sign on the side of it.
Like a delivery car.
The sign read "Brain Gang."
It was one of those guys
that comes to your house to fix your computers.
Randy...
That could be our unsub.
Matt?
No, no, no, how did you find...
Ok, you keep it in a bag on a hanger in your closet.
Why are you doing this?
Searching for I.T. service reps who make house calls
in Glenport village. Give me more.
Set your search parameters at 35 to 40
and see who's working Glenport village.
Those are some bang-up parameters, Brain Brother.
Checking, checking, and...
Nothing.
Which ones overlap with Victoria's neighborhood?
Second verse same as the first. Sorry.
Maybe it's not one of those guys.
What if Randy was wrong?
The details down to the color
were highly specific.
I mean, it's possible our profile's wrong...
The age -- aren't I.T. reps usually younger?
Garcia, new age parameters. 18 to 25.
I am in your headspace.
And I like what I see. I have 4 gentlemen
that match those parameters.
There's Dave Ermini, Tyler Otte, Matt Franks, and --
Wait, hold on. Matt -- Matt Franks?
What is it?
He's my next-door neighbor.
He worked on my computer last week.
He's been in my house.
We profiled increased risk-taking behavior.
5 years ago in Georgia, Matt Franks was arrested
for stalking a girl in high school, a cheerleader.
Charges were dropped. She left town.
Two years after that, Franks was brought in for questioning
regarding the murder of another teen, also a cheerleader,
but detectives didn't have enough evidence on him.
Lewis, get Morgan and go.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on for a second.
What are we looking at here?
Tell me, father to father.
These agents are the best.
In case Matt and Riley aren't there,
I will stay behind here and coordinate.
Why am I doing this?
Same question the other girls asked.
There's no cure for me.
All right? And there's no cure for those guys
over in Glenport Village either.
The other girls?
With the first ones, I was so impatient.
I mean, the woman in Glenport was just...
too old,
And, um, Victoria --
Victoria did it all wrong.
But, um,
let's hope that you get it right.
I will.
I will.
Just...
Not here.
Let's go to the bedroom.
Here we are.
Yeah. We're gonna have fun tonight.
Yes, we are.
So, what's first?
Do your routine.
I need my pom poms.
Well, where are they?
They're just in the closet.
Stop. Why are your pom poms in your dad's closet?
Come on!
Come on!
Ohh...No!
No, no, no!
Lewis, we'll take the front, deputies take the back.
There's a side door. Hopefully he didn't see it.
Here's the keys.
There's also a combination lock. It's 22-10-13.
‭- No!
Sheriff, sheriff!
Back up. Let us do this.
You ruined everything.
Please! Please!
Matt Franks, FBI!
Matt, we're going to talk through this, ok?
Talk? Talk about what?
Whatever you like.
I'm trained to listen.
So, why don't we start with your parents.
My parents.
My parents?
Oh, get him off of me, please get him off of me!
Where's my dad?
He's right outside. Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm ok.
All right, come with me. Come with me.
I was surprised you took that shot.
Yeah, me, too.
It's your first time. You all right?
Yeah. Um...
Just, uh, just tired.
That's how it is.
Every time?
Lewis, he was gonna kill that little girl.
You did what you had to do.
Yeah, I know.
Tomorrow's a new day.
You are right about that.
Well, it's a good thing you're staying.
Well, you know, too.
Come on, now.
Sometimes the days are just rough.
That's what this job is.
And then sometimes you get to see that.
So what do you think?
Honestly, I don't know what to do.
I mean, I have to take this research project,
but I don't want to leave the BAU.
I actually think I'm a better interviewer
now that you've made me a better profiler.
Well, what if you could do both --
coordinate a team and consult with us?
You -- you'd do that?
Of course.
The director's already approved it.
Hey, I don't know what favors you called in, but --
It's not about favors.
It's about everything you've brought to your time here.
When you find good people, you don't want to lose them.
Thank you, sir.
