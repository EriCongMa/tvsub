They can't punish us.
It's not a punishment.
Really?
Being disinvited to your own prom?
You can still celebrate that night in a quiet,
more intimate way.
Veronica's offered to host a small gathering in the backyard barn.
Alison went to prom.
She's hoping to meet Charles.
Sara? I can't believe you'd leave your prom..
This is where I felt I should be. With you.
Our recipients are ultimately chosen by my employer.
Would that be Mr. Carissimi?
That guy was definitely hiding something.
Yeah, you think?
Okay, you couldn't pick that even if you tried.
Emily, this is Ali's phone.
Give her a little kiss.
'Is that you, Charles?'
I know who A is.
His name is Charles DiLaurentis and he's my brother.
Charles..
Oh, my God.
Please don't do this!
We may have a visual of the suspect on the roof.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you.
Look, just because we know who you are
it doesn't mean the game is over.
Hold your fire.
We have civvies up there!
I said stand down!
Don't do this to your sister.
You spent your whole life trying to get back to your family.
It's not too late.
You've been such a bitch to us, but we heard your story.
We understand.
No!
No answer.
Okay. Try again.
Come on!
Open the door!
You've reached the DiLaurent..
Nobody's home.
Ali could be on the roof. Did anybody check the roof?
Guys, we promised Toby that we would stay here
until he escorted us out, remember?
The guys are talking to Clark and Tanner.
She's got a lot of questions, for all of us.
Okay, well, how long do we have to stay here?
We could be out there looking for her.
Em, look, we have to believe that Charles isn't gonna hurt Alison.
She's his sister.
Charles drove his car through my house, Aria, okay?
I believe he'll hurt anybody who gets in his way.
Guys..
we're not alone in here.
Are you sure that you saw somebody?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Hey, Aria, there's no way out of here.
God, Mona, you scared the crap out of us.
I've been following Alison since yesterday morning.
I lost her when you guys jumped the cop.
You knew that Clark was a cop?
Aria, maybe you thought he was always happy to see you,
but I could never get past the bulge in his pants.
What is that?
I started snarfing Alison ever since she came back to town.
Yesterday, she started getting texts. From Charles.
I couldn't get a lock on where he was
so I coded a program to decrypt the signal source and..
What is it?
Mona.
I-it took a while, but..
Okay, Mona, just finish the sentence! Please.
What is it?
Charles has his own cellular network
and the servers are located at..
The Carissimi Group.
I knew it. Rhys is Charles.
Em, where are you going?
I'm going to get Ali.
I'm calling Tanner.
Fine, but I'm not waiting around to answer a million questions.
Let's go.
Oh, my God! Dad?
No!
Oh, my God. Dad.
Why are the cops here?
Wait, you don't think that's Ali's chopped-up body
in those bags, is it?
Hanna.
What?
Isn't that what we're all thinking?
No.
No.
What is in those bags?
And why are they moving them in the middle of the night?
Here comes the cavalry.
Let's go.
Try his birthday.
Do you seriously think we can outsmart A?
Uh, try Mrs. D.'s, 12-18.
Wait, you know Mrs. D.'s birthday?
I'm a self-taught eidetiker.
That's not a learned skill. It's a phenomenon.
Yeah, what is it?
Five days after he took me to the bunker
Charles gave me a red, white and blue cupcake.
But it wasn't Fourth of July.
I kept track of every day I was there.
And every year, he gave me a cupcake on September 7th.
已解锁
See? We are smarter than Charles.
It's just a stupid room.
Yeah, but A's not stupid.
Did we just walk inside A's brain?
Yeah, Hanna. I think we did.
I think he knows we're here.
Sara? You okay?
I'm gonna wait out here.
It's a little tight in there.
Sara!
What is that?
This is a live feed.
It's Alison.
Where is she?
Why would you kill them?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. It's Jason and Mr. D.
We're family.
Who is she talking to?
Oh, my God. Ali's with Charles.
Don't be so dramatic, Ali.
CeCe?
They're not dead... yet.
How could you do this to me?
I risked everything to help you.
You gave me a passport and a plane ticket.
I'd hardly call that everything.
It was all that I had.
If you keep making this about you, Ali
it's gonna be a long night and we don't have much time.
What is she planning?
*Lord help the mister*
*Who comes between me and my sister*
Does she think we came between her and Ali?
Is that what this has all been about?
Wait, so CeCe is Charles?
Sh-she is a she, right?
Wait, shouldn't the cops be here by now?
They're not coming.
How do you think CeCe escaped police custody?
Sara called Tanner directly, right?
What, wait, you think Tanner is working for CeCe?
Yeah, and I bet she told Sara that we're all just fine.
Tanner does wear nice shoes.
Guys, quiet.
They never understood how much I loved you.
From the moment mom brought you home..
I never left your side.
You were like my very own living doll.
And when my dolly was sad..
it made me sad too.
It's okay, Ali.
I'll go get mommy. Shh. Shh.
Mommy. Mommy.
Do you know what makes me feel better?
Come on, baby. I will help you.
Shh, Ali, it's okay.
What's wrong with you?
I love you, Charlie.
And I always will.
I love you more, mommy.
This wasn't the first time, Jess.
We're doing the right thing.
We can't risk him harming Jason or the baby.
I never meant to hurt you.
But that's all Dad needed to get rid of me.
But it was an accident.
He had to have known that.
Oh, I'm sure he did.
I don't understand.
For as long as I can remember..
I asked Mom to buy me dresses.
But he wouldn't let her
so I'd just play dress up in her closet.
She thought it was cute.
But Dad found out... and..
They can hear us. They just can't move.
You never visited me.
Not even once.
Thank God neither of us inherited the bastard's beady eyes.
That's what CeCe did to me.
My brain kept telling me to scream
but my-my body couldn't move.
Jason and Mr. D.
are living a nightmare they can't wake up from.
Oh, my God, Jason.
I feel sorry for Jason,
but I don't think I could ever feel bad for Mr. D.
Same.
Same.
Mom came to visit me as often as she could.
Aunt Carol came a couple of times.
But... for the next seven years at Radley..
I was almost completely alone.
That must have been awful.
You think?
When I turned twelve..
mom bought me this beautiful yellow dress for Christmas.
And after that, every time she would buy you clothes..
she would buy me the same outfit.
Almost like we were twins.
You're beautiful.
Absolutely stunning.
Thanks, Bethany.
Wish we could find a way out of here.
Leaving's easy, Charles.
It's staying gone that would be tough.
My mom always says that nothing's more believable
than a really good lie.
We just need to come up with a great story.
Something fabulous
and devastating at the same time.
Like..
we got lost in the woods
and we were raised by a pack of wolves.
Amateur.
Does it look like I could survive in the woods?
You're too pretty for that.
Our parents were crackheads.
They sold us for a fix.
Please don't make me talk about it anymore.
It's too painful.
Wow. You're good.
Oh, it's that goody two-shoes, Mrs. Cavanaugh.
She can't see me like this. You have to help me.
Of course.
Oh, my God!
Bethany, what did you do?
What did I do?
You pushed her... freak.
So, Bethany blamed you for Mrs. Cavanaugh's death?
No one believed the boy wearing the dress.
I had the most to lose,
so they thought I pushed her.
Even Mom?
She paid off Wilden
to make sure Marion's death
was ruled a suicide.
Oh, my God.
He let Toby think his mother killed herself.
All this time, he thought she chose to leave him.
That changed him.
Mrs. D. sacrificed Toby for Charles.
Now we know who taught A how to treat people like dolls.
Mr. D. Abandoned him
but Mrs. D. taught Charles how to be A.
After that..
the doctors gave me a new diagnosis.
Intermittent explosive disorder.
Why is that funny?
'Cause it was an accurate diagnosis...
for that crazy bitch, Bethany.
The next couple of years, they doped me up on tranqs
till I almost drowned in my own drool.
Literally.
I'm so sorry.
Wait. Now Ali's apologizing?
I mean, is she forgetting the hell that A put us through?
All of us, including her?
I think the quacks felt bad for almost killing me
so they let me out for a funeral.
Who died?
Charles.
We buried him at Aunt Carol's.
And then mom finally accepted me as her daughter...
and I thought I was gonna get to go home...
but she took me back to Radley... as Charlotte.
Wait, so Charles is CeCe
but CeCe is Charlotte?
'What is that?'
It's a motion sensor.
What is it?
It's Radley.
The rear west wing. It's on the second floor.
There's another one?
I thought Ali and CeCe were the only two Red Coats.
So who's that?
What is she doing with those trash cans?
That's not trash.
Oh, my God.
That's why she's telling us her story
that's how she's gonna end it.
CeCe's gonna blow up Radley.
I couldn't trust anyone after Bethany.
So I found a way to escape Radley... without ever leaving.
Mom.
Oh, I have some fantastic news.
They're letting me out?
Well, sort of.
Either I'm locked in here, or I'm not.
There's no sort of being a patient at Radley.
The board has granted you permission to attend classes at UPenn.
How did you do that? How..
You did it, Charlotte
by showing them how smart you are.
Now, now, don't cry.
I'm very proud of you.
I thought going to school would be fun
but I already knew most of what they were teaching.
One day, classes were cancelled...
Okay, I called in a bomb threat.
I knew it was a risk...
but I needed to see my family.
Would it kill you to smile?
What's it to you?
Rude much?
Sorry, I..
What?
Can we start again?
I'm Jason. Jason DiLaurentis.
Next, please.
Do you even go to school here?
No.
But I bet I'll be the prettiest girl in the yearbook.
You didn't tell me your name.
You're right. I didn't.
I'm CeCe.
CeCe Drake.
I know what you're gonna say.
It's screwed up that I dated my brother.
Did you guys...
Okay, that's just sick, Ali.
Like I said, it's my brother.
Why do you think he was so mad all the time?
He was so frustrated.
And who could blame him?
I mean, look at me.
'I can't believe mom was okay with this.'
Mom didn't know CeCe was Charlotte
until the day we left for Cape May.
How could you risk everything you've worked so hard for?
Mom, could you please? Jason and Ali are inside.
If they find out, he'll kill me.
So all this time, you've been
pretending to go to school
while you're running around Rosewood
with my children?
I'm your child too.
I just wanted to be with my family.
Jason asked your father if he could bring his girlfriend..
to the Cape, he's on his way home now to meet you.
What would happen if he found out about me?
Mom, what would happen if he found out about me?
He thinks you're dead.
You told him that grave was real?
All this time..
I thought you did that for me
but you did that for you.
You did that to protect you.
What?
You didn't just bury Charles
you buried your dirty secret.
I lied to him so that you could finally be you.
He never would have allowed it.
Okay, I know I'm bringing a lot...
Not now, Ali.
Mom! I didn't know you were home.
This is CeCe.
She was on the porch when I pulled up.
She's lovely, Jason.
You must be CeCe.
I'm Mr. DiLaurentis.
So nice to meet you.
But I can see you all are getting ready to leave so..
I'm gonna get out of your hair.
But I thought you were coming with us.
Really? Oh, my God.
This is gonna be the best summer ever.
I know you went through a lot that summer.
But we had a hell of a lot of fun too.
Ali..
Every time I remember something..
I have to look at it differently now.
We were so close.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was going to.
I swear.
But that bitch, Bethany, she ruined everything.
She found out mom was having an affair with her dad
and she lost it.
She stole my clothes, she knew I had out privileges
and she snuck out of Radley.
She was gonna hurt mom.
No!
What have you done? What have you done?
I swear, I thought it was Bethany.
I swear, I didn't know it was Ali, mom.
Oh, God.
You have to forgive me, mom.
Please, you gotta forgive me, mom.
She wouldn't look at me.
She wouldn't even look at me.
Mona, are you okay?
I killed Bethany.
I'd been sending Ali threats.
I didn't wanna hurt her. I just wanted to scare her.
But that night, so many people were mad at Alison.
She was all alone in her yard, and the shovel was right there.
It all happened so fast.
You hated Ali that much?
Enough to kill her?
When I hit her, all I could hear was Ali berating me.
Every awful thing she'd ever said to me all at once.
But if CeCe hit Ali..
Bethany had blond hair, and she was dressed just like Alison.
I killed an innocent person.
Bethany wasn't innocent.
Jason told Emily that he saw you that night
wearing my yellow top.
Maybe he saw... Bethany
or he-he saw you.
He didn't see me.
You found her on the highway, outside of Radley.
That's all anybody needs to know.
I was never in Rosewood tonight, ma'am.
And neither was your daughter.
They're never gonna let me out again.
Maybe that's for the best.
Maybe dad was right about me.
I'll understand if you...
never wanna see me again.
Let's just give it some time.
I thought it would take a long time..
for mom to forgive me.
It never occurred to me
that she never totally would.
Hey, you're supposed to be getting us out of here.
I am.
Ah! CeCe's the real Wolf of Wall Street.
She's never made a bad investment.
Oh, my God. He's legit.
CeCe hired Rhys as a decoy.
He didn't even know that he was a stooge.
No one found out I was in Rosewood that night.
But the doctors at Radley knew I flew the coop
so...they took away my out privileges
and I was alone again.
And then the craziest girl showed up.
She was awesome.
I'd sneak into her room every night for story time.
She was so..
drugged up that in the beginning
she thought I was you.
I did everything you asked me to.
I'm proud of you.
You are?
You're getting better.
Just keep taking your meds.
I will, Ali.
I promise.
Tell me more about the girls.
I need to know everything.
I was so bummed when they started
weaning Mona off her meds.
Hearing about what she did to those bitches
was, like, the only thing I looked forward to.
So Mona did know it was you?
I stopped visiting her before
she snapped out of her drug daze.
I could never trust Mona.
She was Hanna's legit friend
and she ran her over with a car.
Where's the loyalty in that?
I really am sorry.
I know.
Mona wasn't ready to end the game.
And she was like Houdini getting in and out of places.
So I made a deal with her.
If she helped me get out of Radley
I'd play the game with her.
It was like Bethany said, leaving wasn't hard.
But I needed Mona's help to stay gone.
And my first assignment
was making friends in Rosewood.
Take it from me,
you're always better off with a really good lie.
Is it just me or did that sound a lot like..
Alison.
Something wrong?
Oh. No. Sorry.
Wow. You just sound a lot like one of our friends.
I hope she's brilliant. What's her name?
Alison DiLaurentis.
You were friends of Ali's?
Me too. I'm CeCe.
I was doing my best Ali imitation ever.
You should have seen the look on those girls' faces.
Oh, it was worth a million bucks.
So why did you move back to Rosewood?
Listen, I hate to make tracks, but I'm already late
and my boss is high-strung and aggressively sober.
Come visit me at the new boutique across the street.
Oh, and if you ever feel like doing a little free shopping,
I'd be happy to turn the other away.
I-I think you're thinking of Hanna.
She's not here.
Okay, that's not just me, right?
That chick is freakishly like Ali.
Mona told me those bitches were happy
that you were gone.
And that, oh...
that really, really pissed me off.
I mean,
those girls were supposed to be your friends.
They got what they deserved.
I don't remember telling CeCe about you.
But somebody at Radley did start sending me
riddles and twisted rhymes.
And it got me really excited about playing the game again.
I kept seeing this blond in a Red Coat
uh, w-watching the girls and I...
First I thought I'd lost it.
I mean, I-I-I watched mom bury you.
I knew if you were alive...
you'd show up if the girls were in trouble.
They all thought you were flying the plane that night.
But I sent a decoy to distract them.
Ali?
Mona thinks she's about to see you.
She doesn't have a clue.
Sara Harvey was the other Red Coat?
When I needed her to be.
What?
No way. She's lying.
And that night, she was supposed to keep Mona busy...
while I trapped the girls.
Oh, it was the perfect plan.
Then Shana showed up
and all hell broke loose.
Did anyone see her?
See who?
Alison.
She pulled me out of there.
She pulled us all out.
No, you're hallucinating.
She was here. I swear it.
Ali's dead.
I saw her too.
So did I.
I knew I wasn't crazy.
You really were alive.
If you really cared about me...
why did you keep playing the game?
When your friends thought they killed Ali in New York
it was the perfect time to end it.
I left the country thinking it was over.
But the game...
it's like a drug.
And I was really good at playing it.
And it felt great to succeed at something.
You attacked me in my own living room.
You were gonna leave, and I couldn't lose you again.
I-I had to make it seem real
so you'd pay attention.
I'm not a bad person, Ali.
You almost froze Aria and Spencer to death.
Almost.
You drove a car through Emily's house!
Yeah, and I almost cut her in half too.
But is she hurt? No.
Is her mommy hurt? No.
I only got mad when you didn't listen.
You can't steal people from their families
and lock them up to play with them like they're your toys.
Yes, I can, and I did.
I know you won't believe me...
but I love all of my dolls.
That's why you're still alive.
I would never let anything
really bad happen to them.
It sucks to kill someone.
Even when they deserve it.
Are you talking about Wilden?
He found out you were alive.
Wilden was never gonna let you come back and tell your story.
Who is that?
You saw the body, right?
Tell me he can never hurt my sister again.
Wilden's dead.
Sorry, Emily... but not really.
Oh, my God!
Shut it off!
We all saw Sara when they brought her out of the Dollhouse.
Are we supposed to think that that was an act?
Em, CeCe's messing with you.
She knows we're watching. She's still playing us.
That's why Tanner is not here.
Sara never called the cops.
I have to get out of here.
Em, what are you doing?
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Get us the hell out of here.
There's no way to open this door.
Spence?
A always has an escape plan.
Hey, one of these is not like the others.
The lights, they aren't randomly blinking on that one.
It's a constant pattern.
Are you making yourself comfortable?
Getting you out of here.
Stand back.
Let's go. Come on.
Mona?
I have to know how the story ends.
Hanna. Be careful.
We will.
Before I saw you in New York,
I snuck home to say goodbye to mom.
And when I got there, she..
When I got there...she..
Mom. Mom!
Mom? Mommy.
Mom. Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy, n-n-no, no.
Mom. Mommy.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
No.
Come on, mommy, you can't leave me.
You can't leave me. You can't leave me. No.
Mom was the only person who ever really loved me.
Ali!
Ali!
Ali, where..
Get out of here!
All of you! Now!
I'm begging you...CeCe..
...please don't do this.
Damn it.
Don't even think about it.
She's headed to the roof!
Please help me.
I tried to keep you safe.
We may have a visual of the suspect on the roof.
No!
Charlotte, please don't do this!
Game over.
Wow, you bring enough flip-flops, Em?
It's Malibu.
Okay, well, you better not come back from Savannah
talking like a southerner. You hear?
Hey, you better not come back from Georgetown
talking like a politician.
Yeah.
I, uh, heard that Sara
got released from the hospital today.
What happened to Sara that night wasn't our fault.
I doubt that's how she sees it.
You guys...
I can't believe we're all actually leaving.
Well, saying goodbye is a lot harder
than I thought it would be.
"How lucky am I to have something
that makes saying goodbye so hard."
What brilliant scholar said that?
Winnie the Pooh.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah...I spent my whole life dreaming
about getting away from here.
But right now, this is the only place I wanna be.
Love you.
Love you too.
Love you.
Love you.
Spencer.
Bye, baby, Hanna-banana.
Bye.
Bye.
Have fun.
You too.
Thanks. Drive safe, guys.
Bye.
Bye.
He's coming for you.
We have to go.
Now, Alison.
We came back here for you, Ali.
So move it!
