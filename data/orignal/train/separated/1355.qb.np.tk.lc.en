my mom around ?
i &apos;m not sure . i haven &apos;t seen her this morning .
i feel like i haven &apos;t seen her in ages .
i know . she picked up some extra hours at the dirty robber .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m actually going to say this ,
but i miss her .
me too .
i know . let &apos;s make a plan to do something together tonight .
yeah , you know what , the bruins are in town all week .
so ?
well , so , i could get tickets for a hockey game .
i have a better idea .
how about jell @-@ o shots and arm wrestling ?
y-- you &apos;re being sarcastic .
come on . let &apos;s have a girls &apos; night .
she can go to a hockey game with frankie .
well , what do you want to do ? wine tasting and ... waxing ?
no .
no , why don &apos;t we just make dinner here ,
then watch a movie together ?
oh . okay , yeah . i like that .
but only as long as you &apos;re doing the cooking .
great .
as long as you &apos;re doing the dishes .
deal .
ooh ! we should watch &quot; iron man 3 . &quot;
i don &apos;t think ma &apos;s seen that one .
no .
no &quot; iron man &quot; whatever the number is .
why don &apos;t we just see something
with a little more emotional resonance ?
okay .
as long as there are no subtitles ,
i don &apos;t care how much resonance it has .
&quot; terms of endearment . &quot;
isn &apos;t that the one where the daughter dies
and the mother cries ?
yes .
no .
okay .
&quot; steel magnolias . &quot;
this is another dead daughter .
is there something that you &apos;re trying to tell me ?
&quot; mommie dearest . &quot;
hell , no !
why don &apos;t we let her decide ?
decide what ?
well , we wanted to do something tonight , the three of us .
yeah , we were thinking of having dinner ,
watching a movie together .
what kind of film would you like to see ?
i can &apos;t tonight .
are you working late again ?
no .
then what &apos;s the problem ?
i &apos;m taking a class at night -- a ... cooking class .
oh , what kind of cooking ?
french .
my favorite -- pot @-@ au @-@ feu , choucroute , steak frite .
i know . i love it .
you love it ?
you love french food ?
what other kind of french food do you love ?
well , i @-@ i like it all .
french onion soup and ...
french fries , french toast .
rizzoli .
isles .
okay .
i mean , when has my mother
ever said no to anything with us ?
that would be never .
exactly . something is off .
at least she &apos;s being more independent .
isn &apos;t that what you wanted ?
not when it interferes with my plans .
i love the body farm .
isn &apos;t this amazing ?
yeah , in a &quot; walking dead &quot; sort of way .
who thinks of something like this ?
well , bcu just wanted a natural setting
in order to study the decomposition
of the dead bodies .
i just wish it was here when i was in school .
why is she so chipper this morning ?
what , are you kidding ? this is like disneyland for her .
yeah . plenty of dead bodies to play with ,
and none of the long lines .
bcu in the middle of a garbage strike ?
no . two of the research bodies were buried under trash .
a student was moving the debris aside with a little backhoe
and accidentally dug up a third body ,
which doesn &apos;t seem to belong here .
what do you got ?
the cyclone fence around the property is in good shape ,
and there &apos;s a working padlock on the front gate .
it &apos;s not fort knox , but the place is secure .
what about security cameras ?
there are only three cameras ,
and they &apos;re all focused on aboveground corpses
to capture time @-@ lapse images of decomposition .
don &apos;t tell maura . she &apos;ll want to watch every minute .
all right , i &apos;ll need you to watch the tape from the cameras ,
see if they picked up anything that can help us out .
corpse cam .
can do .
okay . level of decomposition
indicates she &apos;s been in the ground for at least a month .
any idea what killed her ?
no obvious signs of trauma ,
so i can &apos;t determine a cause of death
until i complete a full autopsy .
somebody knew
this was the perfect place to dump a body .
i went over all this with the first cop .
well , we &apos;d like to hear it again .
besides myself , students , other faculty ,
groundskeepers , delivery people .
well , what about at night ? is there security after hours ?
no , but the grounds are locked up at 9 : 00 p.m.
by a grad student .
he &apos;s very reliable .
we &apos;ll need his name
and a list of all the other people
that have access to the property .
of course .
so , there &apos;s no chance
that this is one of your research corpses ?
no , no , it &apos;s definitely not mine .
how can you be so sure ?
i was brought here to implement systems
that ensure this facility runs flawlessly ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve done .
trust me , i @-@ i know how many bodies are here
and precisely where they &apos;re all placed .
and yet , we &apos;ve found an extra body .
which would lead some to believe the operation isn &apos;t flawless .
so , why don &apos;t you walk us through the process
of what happens when you receive a body ?
please .
our corpses all come from people
who have donated their body for scientific research .
when they arrive here , they &apos;re washed ,
fingerprinted , photographed , and tagged ,
and then each body is placed in or above the ground
and then carefully notated on this map .
i would suggest you do an inventory to make sure
there are no un @-@ notated bodies laying around .
we will .
so , uh , if there &apos;s nothing else ,
i need to get back to my students .
one more thing .
do you know when the trash was placed
on the two research bodies ?
34 days ago .
how long are you gonna be here ?
i &apos;m afraid that your presence
is interrupting my teaching schedule .
well , i suggest you get used to working around our presence
because we &apos;re gonna be here for a while .
from an academic perspective , dr. carlson
is a highly respected forensic anthropologist .
well , from a people &apos;s perspective , he &apos;s a dick .
did he give you anything ?
no , just that the research bodies
were buried and covered with trash 34 days ago .
okay , and our victim was in the ground
for at least a month .
mm , gives us approximately four days window
for ... our body to be dumped in the ground .
i spoke to frankie .
he doesn &apos;t know anything about a cooking class for ma .
why is that significant ?
well , she can &apos;t keep anything to herself ,
yet she doesn &apos;t tell any of us
that she &apos;s taking a cooking class ?
she &apos;s up to something .
okay . you &apos;re starting to sound
more like her mother than her daughter .
i &apos;m telling you ... just watch .
what do we know about her ?
well , she &apos;s still a jane doe .
i wasn &apos;t able to recover prints
due to the decomposition of the epidermis on her fingers .
so i sent out a tissue sample for dna analysis ,
but there &apos;s no way of knowing if she &apos;s even in the system .
is a tox screen even possible ?
only through hair . the lab already has a sample .
i believe she &apos;s in her mid 30s ,
based on the lack of osteoporosis
and the widening of the pelvis base .
also , she was wearing an old housecoat
and house slippers when she was buried .
that &apos;s an odd choice for someone in her 30s .
okay , uh , what about cause of death ?
well , there were abrasions in the tissue around the neck
and hemp fibers in the wound consistent with a rope .
but there were no fractures in the c1 or c2 vertebrae ,
which would be consistent with a violent hanging .
so you think she was strangled with a rope ?
if that were the case ,
we &apos;d expect to find the hyoid bone fractured , which it wasn &apos;t .
okay , well , what is the wound consistent with ?
suicide by hanging .
really ?
so she hung herself
and then drove her body over to the body farm
and then tucked herself in under some garbage .
i don &apos;t think that happened .
yeah , but why make this look like a suicide ?
maybe it was some sort of weird ritualistic killing .
i &apos;ll check vicap ,
see if there have been other staged suicides .
and we got to find another way to i.d. this body .
i &apos;m looking at all the reports
for women who have been missing for at least a month .
what about the list of everyone that had access to the body farm ?
professor carlson hasn &apos;t sent it over yet .
you know what , you go sit in his chair
and tell him you &apos;re not leaving until he gives you the list .
you got it .
i &apos;ll go wait in my chair for the list to show up .
i will wait here in my chair for the list to show up .
this is my chair , and i defend it to the death .
so , how was it ?
it is still the best in town .
ma , you know what , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and i think it &apos;s great
that you &apos;re taking a french cooking class .
yeah , it -- it -- i &apos;ve been really enjoying it .
yeah ?
well , what have you made in class so far ?
uh , what have i made in class so far ?
well , let &apos;s see .
i made a @-@ a really nice french dip .
yeah ?
how do you make a french dip ?
how do you make a fre-- well , you , um ...
you take the roast beef ...
you know , you have to put it in the oven , three--
do you remember when frankie broke your lamp ?
yeah , my favorite green lamp ?
mm @-@ hmm . and he kept denying it .
yeah , but i was onto him from the get @-@ go .
how ? how did you know he was lying about it ?
because every time i asked him what happened to that lamp ,
he would repeat the question to buy himself some time
to make up some kind of lame , phony excuse .
so , how do you make a french dip ?
ma , you always told me
that you don &apos;t have to take time to come up with an answer
if you &apos;re telling the truth ,
and that is a tip that i still use with my suspects today .
so , i don &apos;t believe
that you &apos;re taking a french cooking class .
i just can &apos;t figure out why you &apos;d lie to me about it .
okay , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not taking a french cooking class .
i &apos;m taking ice @-@ skating lessons .
what ? !
well , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t want to tell you .
because , ma , you &apos;re the world &apos;s worst athlete !
i am not !
what about when you took up golf ?
you sprained your wrist getting the bag out of the cart .
okay , that could have happened to anybody .
oh , yeah ?
you remember what happened when you took up tennis ?
and what about when you took up swimming at the &quot; y &quot; ?
you almost drowned .
well , that &apos;s because i got stuck on that safety line .
that line is there for your safety !
why can &apos;t you be supportive ?
why can &apos;t you take up bingo ?
i &apos;m going to do what i want to do .
you shouldn &apos;t be skating , mom .
ohh . you should not be skating .
rizzoli .
what ?
how is that even po--
fine . yes . fine . i &apos;m on my way . okay .
did you know that female athletes
are twice as likely to sustain concussions than male athletes ?
that means , given your athletic prowess ,
you &apos;re like a zillion times more likely
to end up with a traumatic brain injury .
when did you start reading maura &apos;s medical journals ?
it &apos;s not in some medical journal .
that &apos;s from a much higher source --
&quot; espn sportscenter . &quot;
oh , boy ! - you know what , ma , just --
please , no more ice skating .
okay ?
fine .
thank you .
i cannot believe this . how did this happen ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here to find out ,
but we &apos;re gonna need your help , professor .
well , i &apos;ll assist you in any way i can .
you &apos;re gonna love this .
so , my mother is not taking cooking classes .
she &apos;s taking ice @-@ skating lessons .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . she wouldn &apos;t say .
and then when i asked her about it , she got all weir--
what is this ?
a male victim in a deeper grave .
how long has he been here ?
at least a year .
it appears that he has a bullet hole in the back of the head ,
and since i can &apos;t see an exit wound ,
it seems likely that we &apos;ll recover a slug
in the decomposed brain matter .
male victim , gunshot wound to the back of the head --
execution ?
hit man ?
could be for him . less likely for her .
any connection between the victims ?
no way to know based on existing forensics .
you got to wonder if a serial killer or the mob
figured out this was the perfect place to dump a body in boston .
hey . you have an official cause of death ?
gunshot wound to the head .
our victim was killed by a 0.22 caliber bullet .
i sent it to ibis for analysis .
anything to identify this guy ?
not so far .
how about physical ? anything set him apart ?
his left tibia and fibula
were fractured below the knee years ago ,
but it &apos;s a common injury that alone won &apos;t help us .
how about his clothes ?
he wore a t @-@ shirt and jeans from american wear .
i researched the brand ,
and they &apos;ve only been in business since 2007
and they don &apos;t make housecoats .
so we still have nothing to connect our victims .
i didn &apos;t say that .
we found a long blond hair on his t @-@ shirt .
we think it came from our woman victim ?
we don &apos;t have to speculate .
dna testing confirms a match .
so , we know our woman had contact with our man
shortly before he was buried .
absolutely .
well , we know one thing for sure .
he didn &apos;t kill her .
maybe the woman was involved in the man &apos;s murder .
or maybe she was just a witness
and didn &apos;t think she was next .
did we get anything from the missing person report ?
there &apos;s none from the woman who &apos;s been missing for a month ,
but i had frankie and nina refine the search .
they &apos;re now looking for couples who went missing from the area
at least a year ago .
nice .
oh , hey , you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
we found a married couple reported missing
just over 12 months ago .
are they consistent with our victims ?
height and hair color .
and they disappeared right around the same time
we think our male victim was murdered .
if this is our couple , then what has the wife
been doing for the past 11 months ?
and who &apos;s she been doing it with ?
who filed the missing persons report ?
the wife &apos;s sister .
what &apos;s up with susie ?
ah , she said she needed to see us .
hey . that was fast .
it sounded important .
what do you got ?
well , i ran the bullet
we recovered from the victim &apos;s skull through ibis
and didn &apos;t get a hit .
you had us rush all the way down here for that ?
oh , no . that &apos;s not why i called you guys .
i went on a little road trip to maine ,
and i brought back ... traveling gifts .
that &apos;s for you .
thanks .
nice . oh , that is so you .
and this little fella is for you .
i was in this cute little lobster shack
on the wharf in kennebunkport ,
and i ordered the special ,
and the waiter pointed to the tank
and told me i had to pick my lobster .
and i just took one look at this guy , and look at him .
he looks just like you .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;s a lobster .
that could be your twin .
you are crazy .
look at his eyebrows . they look just like yours .
lobsters don &apos;t have eyebrows .
oh , my god ! it does look like you !
oh , give me a break .
and after i saw that face , i couldn &apos;t just leave him there
to be eaten by strangers .
then you keep him .
i can &apos;t .
guess what i named him .
what ?
trey .
frankie jr . jr . jr .
yes .
no .
yes !
you have to take him home .
he looks just like you , and he has your name .
bye .
i just couldn &apos;t believe that she would leave without saying goodbye ,
but the police told me they checked it out
and said my sister gave her notice at work .
they gave me her resignation letter .
i brought it .
thank you .
i guess she quit her job and they moved out of their apartment .
police told me there was no sign of foul play .
bet the police also told you that going missing was not a crime .
what else can you tell us about them ?
oh , i @-@ i brought pictures .
i thought you might like to see them .
they were free spirits .
my sister always talked about moving away , living off the grid .
i hope they just took off to follow their dreams .
what did her husband do for work ?
he was a handyman . he could work anywhere .
was there anything physically distinctive about them ?
scars , missing teeth , broken bones ?
no , not that i know of .
wait .
my brother @-@ in @-@ law broke his left leg just below the knee
in a bike accident a few years ago .
do you know what happened to them ?
i &apos;m sorry to tell you this ,
but we have discovered two bodies
that could possibly be your sister and your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
we could use your help , if you &apos;re up to it .
would you know their dentist ?
dental records would help us identify them .
we had the same dentist .
dental records match for james and bonnie leonard .
what is that ?
why is there a lobster in jane &apos;s desk ?
i &apos;m playing a little joke on her .
you &apos;re poking a beehive .
trust me . this is gonna be funny .
trust me . you &apos;re gonna get stung .
not this time .
why would this time be any different ?
they definitely look like free spirits .
just like her sister said .
nina just finished a complete background investigation on them .
anything interesting ?
nothing out of the ordinary .
no debt , no arrests , no criminal records .
what do the neighbors say about them ?
that they were a nice , ordinary couple who kept to themselves .
of course they were .
what about a love affair gone wrong ?
nothing we &apos;ve found is pointing to that .
in every picture ,
bonnie looks like the hippie her sister described ,
and yet we find her buried in
an old housecoat and slippers that no woman her age would wear .
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
well , let &apos;s think about what we know that does make sense .
someone had access to the body farm .
they buried our couple there
because they thought it was someplace nobody would look .
and they were almost right .
where are we with the list of people that had access to the place ?
the professor finally sent it over an hour ago .
nina &apos;s been running criminal records
on everyone who &apos;s been in and out of there .
good , because right now , that feels like our only lead .
oh , hey . you &apos;re home . i got pizza from mario &apos;s .
i &apos;m not hungry .
well , it &apos;s ... sausage and onion .
your favorite .
maybe later .
are you okay ?
i hurt my ankle .
how ? what did you do ?
oh , i &apos;m sure jane told you about my skating .
i don &apos;t know why she made such a big deal about it .
well , i think she was just ... worried about you .
what ? that i would hurt myself ?
can i take a look at your ankle ?
if you have to .
okay , hold on . i &apos;m just gonna move it a little .
does that hurt ?
well , it-- it looks like a sprain .
yeah , i &apos;ll be all right .
no , you need to stay off your feet as much as possible .
honey , do me a favor .
don &apos;t tell jane .
i don &apos;t need her barking at me again .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;s gonna notice you limping around ?
fine . tell her .
see , i was right . i knew she &apos;d get hurt .
i don &apos;t think the issue is really who &apos;s right and who &apos;s wrong .
i agree . the issue is skating .
it &apos;s something she shouldn &apos;t be doing at her age .
i think it &apos;s a little more complex than that .
complex how ?
well , the depth of your feelings
might indicate that there is a hot @-@ button issue here ,
maybe just below the surface .
meaning ... ?
maybe nothing .
never nothing with you .
what &apos;s up , chang ?
hey . we got the tox screen back for bonnie leonard .
and i have a feeling she wasn &apos;t clean .
our victim had low levels of the tranquilizer ketamine in her system .
special k.
this kind of low dose would allow the victim to function ,
but be easily controlled .
and would play into how she was killed .
it would also explain why the hanging
looked more like a suicide than a violent murder at first .
what kind of animal would do something like this ?
oh , hey , jane . we ...
get this .
some sick bastard shot the husband in the head ,
then abducted the wife --
jane .
what ?
i think we might have found your sick bastard .
we researched everyone .
students , professors , groundskeepers , vendors .
and we found a former grad student
who was responsible for locking up at night .
about a year ago , he was at the body farm late one night
doing some field research .
and then he runs into professor carlson ,
who was all dirty and agitated , right ?
carlson yells at the guy ,
tells him to get out , the place is closed .
right around the time the husband &apos;s body goes into the ground .
no wonder he didn &apos;t feel like being cooperative .
didn &apos;t want to go to jail .
it smells in here .
yeah . there is something fishy .
all right , well , i &apos;m not going back to the dead zone .
well , i &apos;ll have the professor brought in .
maybe he &apos;ll be more cooperative on our turf .
okay , it really smells in here .
it really smells in here .
all right . i &apos;m gonna go get some coffee .
does anybody want anything ?
no , thanks .
i &apos;m good . nothing for me .
no . no , i don &apos;t want any coffee .
all right . i &apos;ll be back later .
i don &apos;t recall being there that night .
maybe you want to think about it a little more carefully .
we have a witness that puts you at the body farm
one night right around the time
our first victim was buried there .
you can still help yourself if you &apos;ll just tell us the truth .
now , is there anything else you would like to say to us
about that night ?
i was there .
ah . doing what ?
i &apos;d been hired by the university to take over the body farm ,
clean up the operation , and i was making my rounds .
and i discovered fresh dirt
and what looked like a set of wheel marks
leading away from a burial site .
i thought someone had removed one of the research corpses ,
hauled the body off with the dolly .
i figured it was a ... college prank
or , you know , maybe some sort of fraternity hazing .
our witness said you were agitated and dirty .
well , of course i was agitated .
i @-@ i was brought here to make sure
things like this didn &apos;t happen .
that doesn &apos;t explain why you were covered with dirt .
i was looking around to see where the body had been taken from .
and you didn &apos;t explain any of this to the university ?
no . there &apos;s no reason to .
and i confirmed that all the bodies were present and accounted for ,
and i decided that what i &apos;d seen ... didn &apos;t matter .
okay .
so , what you &apos;re telling us
is that what actually happened that night
is someone else buried a murder victim
next to one of your research corpses .
yes .
it was buried so deep we never found it ...
until ... you people showed up with the ground @-@ penetrating radar .
where were you the first four days of last month ?
i &apos;m not sure . why ?
it &apos;s important .
uh , atlanta , at a conference .
is there anything else ?
not for now . you can go .
why did you ask him about the first four days of last month ?
because bonnie &apos;s body was buried
within four days of the garbage being spread around .
well played .
we need to check his alibi .
everything okay ?
she &apos;s the best detective in the building ,
and yet she couldn &apos;t figure out
why her desk smelled like captain ahab .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i had to pull the plug on the prank .
if i &apos;d left him there any longer , he would have died .
trey gonna wind up in a lobster pot ?
nope .
i brought him to my dentist &apos;s office .
he &apos;s got this big saltwater aquarium .
at least susie will be happy .
i can &apos;t believe it didn &apos;t work .
it would have been a great prank .
what ?
she knew the lobster was in her desk the whole time .
no way .
yeah .
oh , she &apos;s good .
maura , are you positive about the length of time bonnie was buried ?
well , uh , given the state of decomposition ,
ground temperature , weather conditions ,
i can say with certainty
that the body was in the ground for over 30 days . why ?
&apos;cause it looks our best suspect has an alibi .
i don &apos;t get it .
why kill her after holding her for 11 months ?
you know , there &apos;s a complex psychological element at play here .
the housecoat and slippers feel like part of a fantasy ,
probably related to domestic life .
i suspect that bonnie broke the fantasy .
she does something that upsets him ,
he snaps and hangs her .
it &apos;s clearly psychopathic behavior .
and since we can &apos;t find any similar cases in vicap ,
it &apos;s possible that this was his first attempt
to fulfill his twisted fantasy , and it went wrong .
he killed this woman five weeks ago .
which means that he is probably out there
looking for his next victim .
or he &apos;s already found her .
all right . thank you .
dr. carlson was at the conference the first four days of last month .
two other professors were with him the whole time .
so he was telling the truth ?
looks that way .
hey . we found two women who went missing last week
that match the physical profile of our first victim .
a waitress . an accountant .
we got to move . you take the waitress .
i &apos;ll take the accountant .
公共会计师事务所
why did you report sarah harrison missing ?
i shouldn &apos;t have . it was all a big mistake .
how &apos;s that ?
well , sarah didn &apos;t show up to work for two days ,
and when i called to check on her , her phone was disconnected .
so , she came back to work ?
no , but a day later ,
i got her letter of resignation in the mail .
do you still have that letter on file ?
i &apos;ll have to check .
yes , thank you .
i need you to pull bonnie leonard &apos;s
letter of resignation off my desk and read it to me .
yeah .
&quot; dear mr. phillips , i regret to inform you
that i am resigning from my position as office assistant
for healthful foods distribution effective immediately .
thank you for the support
and the amazing opportunities you &apos;ve provided me -- &quot;
&quot; during my tenure .
i have enjoyed my time with the company so much ,
but i &apos;ve decided to leave boston . &quot;
wait . how did you know that ?
because bonnie and sarah &apos;s letter
were both written by the same person .
our killer .
i &apos;d bet good money sarah &apos;s his new captive .
he must have figured out
that it &apos;s a lot easier to abduct a single woman
so you don &apos;t have to kill the husband first .
yeah . all right .
i want you to run a full background investigation on both women .
we need to know what they have in common
if we &apos;re gonna figure out who abducted them .
i &apos;m on my way .
you got it .
there &apos;s nothing that connects these women
except for the fact that they don &apos;t have criminal records .
okay . we got to keep digging .
well , they didn &apos;t live in the same part of town ,
don &apos;t work in the same industry ,
don &apos;t go to the same church or gym .
they don &apos;t shop at the same grocery store .
one &apos;s single , one &apos;s married .
one went to college , one didn &apos;t .
one owns her home , the other one lives in an apartment .
they couldn &apos;t be more different .
well , there &apos;s got to be something that these women have in common .
water .
the same guy delivered clear spring bottled water
to the office building and the body farm .
no , i checked dr. carlson &apos;s list .
it was a woman who delivered water to the body farm .
it is now , but i looked up her employment records ,
and it turns out she &apos;s only been working the route for about 11 months ,
so i checked with clear spring .
before her , it was a man , jeffery tyler .
he still with the company ?
no . he quit .
dr. carlson said he saw wheel marks leading from the grave .
just like the dollies they use to deliver bottled water would make .
i bet he kept a key to the padlock .
you got an address for this guy ?
318 carlyle avenue .
let &apos;s go .
clear .
clear .
clear .
the tidy home is not what i expected from a deranged psychopath .
well , you can &apos;t judge a book by its cover .
what do you got ?
family photos .
oh , now we know why the victim wore a housecoat .
yeah , it reminded him of dear old mom .
looks like you were right .
this is a first draft
of sarah harrison &apos;s resignation letter , typos and all .
that means he &apos;s already got her .
but where is he holding her ?
call nina . we need to know everything
that she can find on jeffery tyler and his family .
what do you say we tear this place apart ?
thought you &apos;d never ask .
all this crap and not one clue as to where he &apos;s holed up .
find something ?
beretta bobcat , .22 caliber .
i found it stuffed in a bag in the closet .
i &apos;ll bet it matches the bullet
that maura took out of the husband &apos;s head .
speaking of ... it &apos;s maura and nina .
hey . we &apos;re knee @-@ deep in nothing .
have you found anything on this guy ?
well , jeffery tyler has a long history of mental illness .
oh , who would have guessed that ?
he was hospitalized several times as a teenager for depression .
and his criminal record lists two arrests
for assault and battery of two women .
did you find any address other than this apartment ?
just his parents &apos; old address .
but they haven &apos;t been there for years .
his mother was murdered in 1978 .
hanged by his father .
apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the freak tree .
his dad did 36 years in prison
and died there last year .
and that could have been the triggering incident
for his abduction / murder spree .
i looked over the trial transcripts .
the father was consumed with controlling the mother .
she disobeyed him , he killed her .
all right . what about friends ,
relatives , any place that he could be holding these women ?
no living relatives .
the guy was a loner .
it seems he didn &apos;t play nice with others .
there &apos;s got to be something .
wait a minute . what about the family home ?
the deed says it &apos;s still owned by jeffery &apos;s mother and father .
we &apos;re gonna need that address .
i warned you not to go near that door .
i wasn &apos;t .
i go out for 10 minutes to get us a nice bottle of wine ,
and this is what you do ?
i &apos;m sorry .
where &apos;s my dinner ?
i &apos;ll get it .
when i say i want my dinner on the table ,
it damn well better be there !
i &apos;ll teach you to obey me !
police !
put the knife down !
you drop it or i &apos;ll cut her !
put it down ! put it down !
you won &apos;t be cutting anybody .
god !
get your hands behind your back .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all your fault !
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , ma .
i just wanted to tell you i got a movie for tonight .
i &apos;m going out .
i figured .
to the ice rink .
anything more you want to say about that ?
just that ...
i &apos;m sorry for giving you problems about skating .
it &apos;s not my place to tell you what you should do .
thank you for saying that .
you &apos;re welcome .
well , and thank you for caring about your mom .
&apos;cause you were right .
i shouldn &apos;t be skating at this age .
or at any age .
okay , watch it .
and , ma , there are a lot of things
that are wonderful about you .
athletics -- not one of them .
i don &apos;t even like being on the ice .
well , what are you doing it for ?
i met someone .
ma !
and he really likes hockey and skating ,
and i @-@ i ... i just wanted to be a part of his world .
i never got to do any of those things with your dad ,
and i want to do them now .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me this ?
i don &apos;t know .
probably wouldn &apos;t have made a difference anyway .
okay , what is that supposed to mean ?
we --
i don &apos;t know . i just -- i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and you know , i don &apos;t think that i was upset with you
because you were skating .
i think i was upset
because you were skating without me .
you want to go ice skating with me ?
yes !
i have since i was a little girl .
yeah , but , uh ...
there was never any time , was there ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay , ma .
it &apos;s okay .
well ... yeah , you got to go .
i love you .
i want you to be happy , jane .
i want you to be happy , too , ma .
i know .
don &apos;t stay out too late , young lady .
don &apos;t wait up !
hey . where have you been ?
the dirty robber .
ah . have you been drinking ?
no , i have been doing some mother / daughter bonding .
oh , i &apos;m sorry i missed it . i love bonding .
well , i &apos;m sure we will bond some more .
i did get us an action movie with emotional resonance .
&quot; thelma &amp; louise ! &quot;
but this isn &apos;t an action movie .
it &apos;s a chick flick .
uh , agree to disagree .
&quot; this film is a celebration
of two uniquely powerful women fulfilling their destiny
and bound together for eternity . &quot;
i &apos;d call that a chick flick .
what ? let me see that .
no .
&quot; this film is a celebration of two bad @-@ ass chicks
who drive their car over a cliff . &quot;
action flick .
fair enough .
but you know , we have something in common
with thelma and louise .
oh ? how so ?
well , we &apos;re both unique individuals ,
and yet we have found a common connection .
okay , yeah . i &apos;ll buy that .
like yin and yang .
yin and yang ?
which one am i ?
oh , well , you &apos;re yin , of course -- shady and cool .
no , i want to be yang .
nope . that &apos;s me . sunny and bright .
well , how come you always get to be the sunny one ?
because of attitude like that .
well , i was gonna tell you something about my mom
and taking your advice , but no .
now i &apos;m not going to
because my attitude is so dark and shady and childish .
jane ...
no .
please .
i didn &apos;t say childish .
your eyes did .
oh , come on !
mm , it &apos;s so good , too .
come on .
nope .
