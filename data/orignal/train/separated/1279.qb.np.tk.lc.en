emergency drill initiated .
bug @-@ out seal in 1 minute and 41 seconds .
air lock engaged ,
ventilation system operational .
all is well .
i wonder if the chard is locally sourced .
mm , you should ask . we don &apos;t want foreign chard .
it &apos;s from the gentleman .
oh , come on .
you know , french women don &apos;t obsess over having
the occasional glass of wine when they &apos;re pregnant .
french women don &apos;t shave their underarms .
good point .
i &apos;ll let him down easy .
she &apos;s a lesbian !
gay !
how very open @-@ minded of him .
she &apos;s also in her first trimester .
pregnant .
stop it !
hm . well @-@ played .
oh , that reminds me of something i &apos;ve been meaning to bring up .
baby &apos;s college fund .
it &apos;s never too early to start a 529 savings plan .
i mean , the tax benefits alone are worth the paperwork .
i &apos;m sorry . i kind of dozed off there for a second .
what were you saying ?
very funny .
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
is that really true about french women ?
i don &apos;t actually know . i &apos;ve never been with one .
peter baldwin , 35 , lived alone .
nothing out of the ordinary about the house except for this .
i &apos;ve always wanted one of these .
shaggy and scooby would be so proud .
after you , velma .
no , she &apos;s velma . i &apos;m daphne , obviously .
maura , back me up on this ?
i &apos;m going to examine the body .
velma .
what &apos;s in there ?
some kind of bunker .
custom @-@ built .
guy went in , didn &apos;t come out .
friend got worried and called the police .
took fire rescue two hours to cut through that door .
i was right .
i really didn &apos;t want to be right .
you called the police ?
scott hines , detective rizzoli .
i still can &apos;t believe it . like , i just talked to him .
w @-@ what can you tell us about this ?
it &apos;s a bug @-@ out shelter .
a bug @-@ out shelter .
we &apos;re survivalists .
as in doomsday , end times .
these shelters are meant to be totally self @-@ sustaining
in a worst @-@ case scenario .
well , how can you tell what the worst case scenario will be ?
well , it &apos;s a big topic of debate .
how so ?
well , i mean , the possibilities are endless .
you got f5 tornadoes , solar flares ,
black holes , nuclear fallout .
everybody &apos;s got different theories .
and what was peter &apos;s theory ?
airborne toxins -- sarin gas , agent 15 .
受 《 禁止化学武器公约 》 管制
h1n1 , h5n1 ...
yeah , i @-@ i think we got it .
rita , his wife ...
she died of drug @-@ resistant tuberculosis a few years ago .
that &apos;s when he got into all this stuff .
why was he in there yesterday ?
24 @-@ hour test run .
he did them every couple of months .
but when he didn &apos;t come out at the scheduled time ,
i got a bad feeling .
okay . thank you very much .
okay . if this is what surviving the apocalypse looks like ,
i &apos;d rather be a zombie .
the whole place is sealed completely from the inside .
that &apos;s a re @-@ breathing unit over there .
recycling his own air ?
some first @-@ class paranoia .
extreme , but it &apos;s not unfounded .
you know , the black plague killed one european in four
in the 14th century .
influenza killed nearly 20 million people
between 1918 and 1919 .
well , i don &apos;t think he died from the flu .
maura , could this have been a heart attack ?
well , he has signs of vasoconstriction ,
but his rigor is more advanced
than i &apos;d expect , given body temperature .
so no heart attack .
well , i &apos;m more inclined to say he had some sort of a seizure ,
perhaps from a potential loss of oxygen .
there &apos;s blown fuse in the ventilation unit .
that could cause a drop in oxygen .
co2 poisoning seems like a rookie mistake
for somebody who &apos;s obsessed with being able to breathe .
and carbon dioxide poisoning isn &apos;t sudden .
you know , he would have had time to change the fuse
or simply just open the door before he lost consciousness .
but this -- it feels sudden .
so ... murder ?
it &apos;s suspicious .
alone in a sealed room .
i &apos;m not going to say he was murdered .
it &apos;s suspicious .
we have a mystery .
if only we had the mystery machine .
really ? still with the scooby doo ?
zoinks !
better get that fuse to the lab .
you realize that every episode was exactly the same , right ?
a greedy millionaire dresses up as a ghost
to protect his property from a land grab .
it &apos;s a classic .
the title character is a talking dog .
who solves crimes .
agree to disagree .
and he was a great dane , by the way .
hey . i &apos;m all worried about frankie .
i think we have a problem .
and by &quot; we , &quot; you mean ... ?
twice this week , i offered to make him dinner .
he refused .
if i call him on his phone at night , he doesn &apos;t answer .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s ... sleeping , do you ?
if i ask him where he was , he gets all defensive .
i -- i mean , i think it &apos;s a girl .
oh , ma .
come on . the last time he kept a secret from me
was smoking cigarettes with the wrestling team
behind papa gino &apos;s , remember ?
you do realize you &apos;re talking about high school .
listen , can &apos;t you just find out something for me ?
okay .
but i -- i think you &apos;re being paranoid , okay ?
and i don &apos;t think frankie is smoking .
or wrestling .
i &apos;m not paranoid .
i &apos;m protective .
how you doing , frankie ?
fine .
good .
what &apos;ve we got ?
peter baldwin was a v.p. at an electronics firm .
talked to his co @-@ workers -- they liked him .
seemed like a normal guy .
yeah , except for the whole post @-@ apocalyptic survival thing .
what side of the door do you want to be on ?
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a popular motto among preppers .
oh , they seem nuts until the day the shit hits the fan ,
then we all come running to them for toilet paper .
you &apos;ve been doing research ?
or i &apos;m a prepper .
i &apos;m not a prepper .
but it &apos;s not some weird fringe group .
there &apos;s thousands of these bunkers all over the country .
whole websites devoted to designing them .
there are websites devoted to costumes for cats .
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re not crazy .
we &apos;re gonna go to csru , see if they found anything at the scene .
sign this birthday card . lisa in dispatch -- turning 40 .
mm . the dreaded &quot; f &quot; word .
okay .
40 ... is the new 30 .
no .
40 ... is just a number .
no.40 ...
kind of sucks .
happy birthday . love , jane .
oh , i was just gonna call you .
i &apos;ve got a surprise here .
i don &apos;t like surprises .
it &apos;s a good one .
do you want to talk about it ?
we are talking about it .
we are ?
maura , we don &apos;t have time for this . i need you to focus .
okay .
uh , would you like to hear the cause of death ?
yes , please .
halon gas .
what &apos;s that ?
in liquefied form , it &apos;s combined with other chemicals
to interrupt the chain reaction necessary for combustion .
a fire extinguisher .
in liquefied form .
in gas form , it &apos;s odorless , it leaves no residue ,
and in large concentrations , it &apos;s fatal to humans .
so he suffocated .
it would be like drowning in a room with no water .
could this have been a freak accident ?
like a fire @-@ safety @-@ system malfunction or something ?
you know , halon is a chlorofluorocarbon .
it &apos;s been phased out as a commercial fire suppressant .
i know of no natural sources of it .
if it was in that bunker ...
somebody pumped it in there .
he was probably dead before he could do anything about it .
well , mr. airborne toxins
was supposed to be in a completely sealed chamber .
i &apos;ll have susie take a mass spectrometer over to the bunker
and see if she can detect how the gas got in .
okay , uh ,
frankie &apos;s supposed to go over there and meet the builder .
i &apos;ll have him tell you when .
okay .
is there something else ?
what brought you down here ?
korsak &apos;s retiring .
what ? since when ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , what did he say ?
he didn &apos;t .
then how do you know ?
i saw the retirement package on his desk .
it never occurred to me that he &apos;s old enough to retire .
you need to talk to him and get the facts .
it &apos;s possible that you &apos;re drawing conclusions too early .
i can &apos;t imagine doing this without him ,
especially so soon after losing frost ...
look , all you know is that he is preparing for the future .
that doesn &apos;t mean that he is leaving today .
right .
you remember where you were when kennedy was shot ?
what ?
jfk .
there was a documentary on the other night .
you remember when he was shot ?
better than you do , i bet .
well , yeah , but , i mean ,
you couldn &apos;t have been that old , and ...
you must have been , like -- - old enough to know
l.b.j. was gonna send us to vietnam .
good news is peter &apos;s laptop is functional .
and the bad news ?
it &apos;s encrypted with pentagon @-@ level security .
can you get somebody to crack it ?
yeah . i @-@ i &apos;ll get somebody .
okay .
um ... have a look at this guy &apos;s bank records .
large cash withdrawals at regular intervals
over the last year .
just under 10 grand each time .
mm @-@ hmm . trying to dodge irs attention .
regulation &quot; d &quot; triggers are meant
to flag drug dealers , money launderers .
peter didn &apos;t fit those profiles .
i &apos;m telling you , these guys hate the government .
he wouldn &apos;t want the feds
looking into what he was doing with his money ,
even if it was legal .
he withdrew most of his life savings --
over 400 grand .
what would he need that kind of cash for ?
did he have any enemies ? was there somebody blackmailing him ?
neighbor saw a fistfight
between peter and somebody named noah
not long ago right on the front lawn .
what do guys like this have to fight over , duct tape ?
don &apos;t underestimate these guys , jane .
now , when i pulled his phone records ,
i found calls to and from a noah forsythe
until a month ago , then the calls stopped .
they didn &apos;t speak again .
let &apos;s pick him up ,
see what their beef was .
all right .
hey , i don &apos;t need to worry about you showing up to work
in a little tinfoil hat , right ?
you laugh , but there &apos;s evidence
that those hats are effective against --
do me a favor -- never finish that sentence .
maura and i are headed to the bug @-@ out .
all right , keep an eye out for little green men .
how many of these things have you built ?
oh , dozens .
you a survivalist , too ?
no , no .
the , uh , doomsday guys trust me .
i have a lot of workarounds for building codes ,
permit rules , boring stuff like that .
well , it must have been good business .
yeah , they were great guys ... especially peter .
it &apos;s a real shame .
i have to admit , at first ,
i thought they were all a little nuts .
well , i have to say ,
the more time i spend around pathogens ,
the more sense something like this makes to me .
well , i have a new model that blocks out microbes
down to the molecular level .
well , how do you do that ?
micron filters , mainly .
filters on that scale are a fortune .
how much do you charge for that model ?
actually , uh , what i &apos;m looking for here
is how someone could pump air into the ventilation system
once the unit is sealed .
that &apos;s impossible .
do you have an emergency valve that accessed an outside vent
in case the system failed ?
no , peter wouldn &apos;t have allowed that .
listen , bob , peter died from a gas
that shouldn &apos;t have been in here .
trying to figure out how that happened .
i built this thing according to peter &apos;s specs .
i &apos;m telling you -- the bunker was sealed .
dr. isles .
yes , susie ?
none of our equipment is working ,
and the spectroscope is on the fritz .
i can &apos;t even get a barometer reading .
well , did you check it before we left the lab ?
i thought i did .
all right , we &apos;re going to need to run some diagnostics
back at the lab .
do you have a card ?
let me know if you want to look at that new model .
you ever build one with a shoe closet ?
want some coffee ?
why , so you can have my fingerprints on file ?
there a reason i should have your prints ?
guys like you don &apos;t need a reason .
i want to ask you about peter baldwin .
what about him ?
word is you were close , and then you weren &apos;t .
what happened ?
we had a fight .
anything to do with all the money he paid you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
this is a record of large cash withdrawals
peter made from his bank accounts .
on the days of those withdrawals ,
we have his cellphone and your cellphone
going to the same locations at the same times , okay ?
you tracked my cellphone ?
you got a warrant for that ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what the jury &apos;s gonna focus on ?
oh , &quot; the jury &quot; ? so , you think i killed him .
you and peter were close .
after the falling out , you decided ,
why not use his secrets against him ?
what secrets ?
whatever he was paying you to keep quiet .
look , this is a gross misuse of taxpayer money --
spying on private citizens , tr--
well , i will care a lot more about your politics
when i don &apos;t like you for peter &apos;s murder .
gold , okay ?
he was buying gold from me .
you &apos;re a gold dealer ?
some preppers think that , when the banks fail ,
you can roll up your paper money and smoke it .
gold &apos;s the only sure thing .
where &apos;d you get it ?
estate sales mostly , internet auctions .
it &apos;s off @-@ book , but it &apos;s not illegal .
i had my differences with peter ,
but i still like green money , and he had a lot of it .
you didn &apos;t tell me what the fight was about .
i helped him build his bug @-@ out , and in return ,
he said i could crash there if d @-@ day ever came .
but then , he reneged
after i pooh @-@ poohed his stupid airborne @-@ toxic @-@ event theory .
the fight was about how the world will end ?
it &apos;s robots , obviously .
intelligent machines , networked data .
i &apos;m right about the robots , detective .
we &apos;re all just one keystroke away from anarchy .
i &apos;ll go back up my hard drive .
hi . the builder any help ?
none whatsoever .
have you checked for any indication
that peter brought the halon in with him ?
mm , how , like a delayed @-@ release bomb ?
possibly .
well , csru went through his duffel bag .
it was mostly guns and ammo .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m looking up korsak &apos;s service record
to see when he &apos;s eligible for retirement .
you &apos;re snooping .
this is not snooping .
then why are you using my computer ?
because i don &apos;t want him to catch me not snooping .
when i told you to get the facts ,
i did not mean to imply --
it &apos;s frankie .
i have to go . to be continued .
she &apos;s snooping .
what do you got ?
i broke the encryption code .
we think we have footage from right before peter died .
i &apos;m sorry , you broke the code ?
i called in a favor with a techie friend .
well , you owe that friend a six @-@ pack .
let me see it .
wait , wait , right there .
right there . go in .
see that box behind him ?
that wasn &apos;t in the bug @-@ out .
you &apos;re right .
what would the dimensions of 400 grand in gold bars be ?
one kilo is worth about 40 grand
and roughly the size of a smartphone .
so ... 400 grand would be about 10 smartphones ?
that &apos;s about what you could fit in that lockbox .
the wall safe was empty .
that &apos;s probably where he kept the gold
when he wasn &apos;t , you know , bugging out .
mm @-@ hmm , and during his practice run ,
he took it in there with him ,
along with his guns and his canned beans .
and somebody else took it out .
yeah , peter wasn &apos;t just killed . he was robbed .
somebody got in the bunker
that nobody was supposed to get into .
the door was sealed .
what &apos;s that saying ?
one door closes , another one opens ?
you think there was another door ?
yeah .
and peter was on the wrong side of it .
right .
there &apos;s got to be a way in .
we &apos;re missing something .
we could run ground @-@ penetrating radar over the property ,
map the subsurface .
a hidden entrance might show up .
yeah , frankie , will you set that up for tomorrow ?
uh ... now ?
yeah , now . why , you got a date ?
i have an appointment ... that i can &apos;t miss .
i &apos;ll do it .
thanks .
uh ... see you .
what &apos;s that about ?
who knows ?
people have all kinds of secrets , i find .
guess so .
is there something you &apos;d like to tell me ?
have a nice night ?
explain to me again
why i &apos;m not on my couch eating nachos .
well , this case has me thinking --
there is merit in planning for unforeseen circumstances .
you can &apos;t plan for unforeseen circumstances , maura ,
hence the term &quot; unforeseen . &quot;
well , i &apos;m talking about preparation ,
not psychic interventions .
of course you can &apos;t know what the future holds .
true , because i thought
my future held nachos , cheese , jalapeno , for example .
which is why we need to live in the moment ,
seize the day .
what did you do ?
nothing ... yet .
triumph bonneville t100.2008.
excellent condition and a very reasonable price .
is this what you do when you say you &apos;re having a working lunch ?
what is that ?
sidecar ... custom addition .
easy handling and , by all accounts ,
a very smooth ride .
are you starting a pedicab company ?
it &apos;s for you .
okay .
why ?
it &apos;s a great alternative @-@ travel option .
now , what if you go into labor
and traffic is ... is gridlocked ,
or we need to leave town in case of an emergency ?
you know , the triumph handles rough terrain and service roads .
we could even ride it on the sidewalk if we wanted .
are you using this pregnancy
to satisfy one of your impulse buys ?
no , i &apos;m ... i am planning for the unexpected .
and seizing an opportunity .
it won &apos;t be on the market long .
shall we take it for a test @-@ drive ?
it &apos;s korsak confirming the gpr tomorrow .
have you talked to him yet ?
i tried . it was not fruitful .
yes , but did you ask him openly and directly
about what you saw ?
could we please talk about something else ?
sure .
what color helmet do you want ?
i want nachos .
all right , thanks .
the guys say it &apos;ll take about a half @-@ hour to map the property .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were retiring ?
who said i &apos;m retiring ?
i saw the forms on your desk .
you went through my desk ?
no , they were in plain view .
oh , really ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
you got one foot out the door ,
and you don &apos;t think i deserve to know ?
i didn &apos;t realize it was all about you .
it &apos;s about trust , vince .
i told you about my pregnancy .
you wouldn &apos;t give me a heads @-@ up on this ?
has it occurred to you
what this reaction is why i didn &apos;t tell you ?
has it occurred to you
that this reaction is because you didn &apos;t tell me ?
did you pinpoint the problem ?
the problem is there is no problem .
something interfered with my equipment at the scene .
i tested everything ,
and everything &apos;s working fine now .
and the software ...
did you run an antivirus program ?
twice .
so , the problem is at the site itself .
this is a little out there ,
but an electromagnetic field would cause problems like this ,
though i didn &apos;t see anything to indicate that .
but that doesn &apos;t mean it wasn &apos;t there .
you &apos;re right .
hi , maura . what do you got ?
an electromagnetic hatch
that could be held in place undetectably
as long as the power source is intact .
okay , well , what am i looking for ?
redirect the radar team to inside the bug @-@ out .
tell them to look for a battery or a small generator .
i am on my way there with an emf meter .
okay .
change of plan .
i mean , you didn &apos;t think i had a right to know ?
i think i have a right to my privacy .
when did you become so secretive ?
when did you become so nosy ?
have you met my mother ?
you know it &apos;s &apos; cause you mean so much to me ...
that &apos;s why i got so upset .
oh , i know .
and i &apos;m sorry i called you nosy .
i &apos;m sorry i went through the stuff on your desk .
even though it was in plain view .
i &apos;m just trying to figure out where i &apos;m headed .
that &apos;s why i hired a life coach .
the packet was kiki &apos;s suggestion .
i &apos;ve seen so many guys wait so long to retire
they can &apos;t enjoy it when it comes .
kiki said filling out the forms
might help me figure out how i feel .
and did you ?
do i look like i &apos;ve figured out anything ?
well , if anyone has earned the right
to enjoy their retirement , it &apos;s you , vince .
i also applied to take the lieutenant &apos;s exam .
really ?
i &apos;m just ... considering my options .
well , i think you &apos;d make a great lieutenant ,
just like you make a great sergeant .
detectives ...
we got something .
there &apos;s a sewer tunnel under the bunker .
sounds like a good way to sneak in and out without being seen .
or not .
that &apos;s bob mcgrath , the builder .
it &apos;s a lot of bodies to find
in a place designed for survival .
bomb squad thinks he was planting a homemade c @-@ 4 bomb
but mis @-@ wired the timer .
trying the blow up the evidence of the hatch .
blew himself up instead .
okay , so , he gets himself hired to build the shelter .
then , he modifies the plan
and leaves himself a secret entrance
so he can sneak in and snake peter &apos;s gold .
but how did he know peter had
the gold in there with him in the first place ?
maybe peter told him .
maybe noah forsythe told him .
did you find the gold at bob &apos;s house ?
yeah , and that &apos;s not all .
insulin , antibiotics , diamonds , cartons of cigarettes .
so , peter wasn &apos;t his first victim .
he &apos;s been pulling this stunt on all his clients .
those that were worth his while
with stocks of commodities he thought could sell or trade .
classic marauder .
a what ?
marauders .
they &apos;re the opposite of survivalists .
instead of making their own plans ,
they &apos;re opportunists ,
roving around preying on other people .
sounds like a &quot; road warrior &quot; sequel .
technically , &quot; the road warrior &quot; was a sequel .
it makes sense , if you think about it .
what &apos;s easier --
building and stocking your own bug @-@ out shelter
or figuring out who the guys are that have them
and then raiding those ?
okay , but if all bob wanted to do was rob his clients --
i mean , he had a foolproof system .
why kill peter ?
bob was the only one who knew about the gold .
peter would have known it was him
as soon as it went missing .
or it could have been an accident .
bob was lousy at building bombs .
maybe he was no good with chemistry .
he thought he was gonna knock him out , wound up killing him .
either way , it just seems like a lot of trouble for a box of gold .
you would be a terrible marauder .
i would not .
are you kidding me ? you wouldn &apos;t last two weeks .
i &apos;m a survivor , thank you .
and if the chips were down ,
i would step over my own mother
to get to --
she &apos;s right behind me , isn &apos;t she ?
how do you do it ?
do you have the place bugged ?
i heard about the bomb . are you okay ?
are you --
are you feeling all right ?
break room , please .
what happened to your face ?
keep your voice down , all right ?
not everybody knows , you know ?
well , maybe they should
so they stop sending you into a very dangerous situation
that could get you killed .
it &apos;s kind of in the job description , ma .
god , jane .
take some time off , a vacation , a leave of absence .
for nine months ?
ma , i spoke to my doctor . i &apos;m fine .
okay ?
it &apos;s my job . i &apos;m not gonna quit .
well , i &apos;m a mother , and it &apos;s my job ,
and i &apos;m not gonna quit , either .
it &apos;s maura . i got to go .
look , if it makes you feel better ,
i think this case is wrapping up , okay ?
okay , fine .
great .
okay , just one last thing .
you find anything out about frankie ?
okay , this -- this nosy thing that you &apos;re doing ,
this is why frankie doesn &apos;t tell you stuff .
this is why i don &apos;t tell you stuff .
you don &apos;t tell me stuff
because you don &apos;t know what &apos;s good for you .
you &apos;ll soon see how i feel ,
and you &apos;ll know that i &apos;m right !
you need to give yourself a raise .
you were right about the electromagnets .
i &apos;ll bring it up with the commonwealth .
yeah , you and frankie must have spooked bob here
when you questioned him about the bunker .
he killed himself trying to cover his tracks .
i &apos;m not sure i agree .
his lungs are well @-@ aerated .
no smoke or particulate inhalation .
he was at the center of the explosion .
which means he might have been dead
when the bomb detonated .
look at this --
subdermal hematoma consistent with being struck
with a blunt object .
bob has a partner .
had .
so , bob and partner rob peter with this trap @-@ door scheme ,
but peter ends up dead .
frankie and i talked to bob .
bob gets nervous ,
mm @-@ hmm . tells the partner that we &apos;re on to him .
partner takes the opportunity
to destroy both the evidence and bob .
it really seemed like this case was over .
clearly , that &apos;s what he wanted us to think .
&quot; marauder &quot; is the french word meaning &quot; rascal . &quot;
all cultures have them .
really ?
pirates , bandits -- it &apos;s a practice as old as time .
you know , the united states had a nuclear @-@ fusion research project called marauder
which stood for &quot; magnetically accelerated ring
to achieve ultra @-@ high directed energy and radiation . &quot;
no shit .
yeah .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
sure .
what &apos;s up , chang ?
listen , ma &apos;s always gonna give any girl you &apos;re dating a hard time ,
but you can &apos;t hide this girl forever .
just bring her around . i &apos;ll run interference .
thanks , but ... that &apos;s not what i &apos;ve been doing at night .
what are you doing , then ?
computer engineering .
i &apos;ve been taking courses .
how ? w @-@ when ?
night classes -- programming , data systems , repairs .
wait a minute . the encrypted hard drive --
was that you ?
no , i &apos;m still a novice . that was bahar .
bahar .
this israeli kid in my class . he &apos;s 19 .
look , jane , they &apos;re not gonna put me in homicide
as long as you &apos;re still here .
but i could be a detective in bric .
i &apos;m just getting my ducks in a row
so i can make a push for it .
well , that &apos;s an ... incredibly ... sound plan for the future .
thank you .
but what -- what &apos;s with all the secrecy ?
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be any good at it .
frost was the best .
and i knew that you wouldn &apos;t cut me any slack
if i didn &apos;t have a handle on it .
you &apos;re doing great .
and -- and i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really proud of you .
and bahar .
thank you .
but , please , don &apos;t tell ma .
she &apos;ll just use me like i &apos;m her personal genius bar .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
mm . okay , um ...
i &apos;ll handle ma .
uh , i @-@ i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll just tell her you have a new girlfriend .
just make it believable .
i &apos;ll tell her she &apos;s a stripper .
great .
thanks .
so , bob and his partner
steal from bob &apos;s survivalist clients .
we know what bob &apos;s role was . he built the secret entrances .
but who is the partner ?
another survivalist , you think ?
would explain how they knew each other .
maybe the partner hired bob to build his shelter .
they get to talking about all bob &apos;s other clients ,
what easy targets they &apos;d be .
can we track down who has these bunkers ?
bob dodged a lot of permit regulations ,
so the bunkers were probably off the record .
what about theft reports
for any of the stolen goods over at bob &apos;s house ?
i checked the ncic . there wasn &apos;t much .
then again , you don &apos;t file a report
if you don &apos;t want people to know
what you &apos;ve been stockpiling in the first place .
no , we got to find the people he robbed ,
work backwards to connect them to the partner .
well , i have a few names .
there was a woman who
reported diamond theft who lives in the area .
let &apos;s talk to her .
what about clients from bob &apos;s firm ?
i got the list .
well , start running background checks , see if anybody sticks out .
do you know who took our diamonds ?
we were hoping to speak to your husband , too .
lewis would never set foot in a police station .
no offense .
you reported $ 20,000 worth of diamonds stolen .
six months ago . we haven &apos;t heard anything since .
do you recognize this man ?
no .
this isn &apos;t the guy who built your bug @-@ out ?
no . lewis built it himself .
how about this guy ?
i don &apos;t think so .
do you have a lead or not ?
because i really need to get home .
okay , wait , wait . one more question .
um , uh , why diamonds ?
it wasn &apos;t to make you a necklace , was it ?
not even a pair of earrings .
lewis said the diamonds were an investment .
first , he wanted to buy fuel .
i told him i &apos;m not spending my retirement money
on propane tanks .
who knew about the diamonds besides you and lewis ?
the gem dealer . he &apos;s based in brazil --
the guy who referred us to the dealer , my mom .
the guy who referred you -- you remember his name ?
oh , i have his card .
scott hines .
peter &apos;s friend . the one who called the cops .
yeah , no wonder he was so broken up about his poor friend .
police !
go , go , go !
clear !
don &apos;t say it .
looks like he bugged out .
his car &apos;s gone .
nobody &apos;s seen him for a day and a half .
if i &apos;m scott , where do i put my bug @-@ out shelter ?
the dirt sample we found in scott &apos;s garage
is not consistent with the soil on his property .
so he tracked it in his tire treads from somewhere else .
it would appear so .
though , not necessarily the same location
as the bug @-@ out shelter .
but i don &apos;t want to make any assumptions .
what &apos;d you find ?
a significant concentration of mountain spleenwort pollen .
excuse me ?
a little fern .
it originated in the appalachian region ,
and then it extended to western massachusetts .
frankie .
yeah ?
can you search county clerk database
anywhere west of springfield
to see if there &apos;s any property linked to scott ?
sure .
it &apos;s bug out .
bug out .
it &apos;s stupid no matter how you pronounce it .
got something .
looks like a couple acres in southwick .
uh , property deed for hubert hines ,
deceased as of 2008 .
i &apos;ll bet we know who inherited that land .
that would be a perfect place to build a cabin
for the end of the world .
bug ... out .
bug out .
bug ... out .
bug out .
we &apos;re in the right place .
i don &apos;t see the cabin .
there &apos;s not gonna be a cabin .
he wouldn &apos;t leave himself open to be spotted
by black helicopters or whatever else it is
he thinks is following him .
underground .
i &apos;m guessing this guy went down deep .
well , everybody &apos;s got to breathe .
does that tree stump look a little too perfect to you ?
how long does it --
there !
welcome to doomsday , buddy .
anarchist &apos;s wife came by .
which anarchist ? robot rebellion ?
no . diamonds are forever .
ah . how is she ?
came to thank us .
says her husband &apos;s gonna make her those earrings after all .
our work here is done .
am i the only one struck by the irony
of the people obsessed with survival
are picking each other off like flies ?
this is an isolated incident .
you &apos;re still defending them ?
i &apos;m just saying .
we could all be a little bit more prepared
in case of emergency ...
which is why --
... i put these together .
one for everybody .
korsak .
thanks .
jane .
go ahead . open them up .
okay .
better than dry leaves .
antibacterial ...
beef stew mre -- gross .
and there &apos;s a couple of personalized items
for both of you .
freeze @-@ dried ice cream . okay , now , this i can use .
likewise .
we are officially prepared for the end of the world .
y @-@ you &apos;re eating it now ?
you never know .
sidecar ... and a virgin sidecar .
mmm . what &apos;s in a virgin sidecar ?
basically lemon juice .
thank you .
say armageddon really happened .
not you too .
well , just as a thought experiment .
the end of the world is nigh .
what would we really need to survive ?
well , my list is a lot shorter than yours .
how do you know ?
because you would give up state secrets
if someone took away your memory @-@ foam pillow .
that is true . i would definitely need my pillow .
and a humidifier .
oh , and can you imagine facing down the end of the world
with bad cuticles ?
oh , i shudder to think .
mm , so , yes . a manicure kit .
of course .
come on . what would you stockpile ?
jerky .
lots and lots of jerky .
i give up .
but don &apos;t come crying to me when you get a hangnail .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said --
about planning for the baby &apos;s future .
oh ?
if something ever happens to me ,
you know , something serious ,
i would want you to have the baby .
i mean , would you be willing to do that ?
i would be honored .
you know , the sidecar is surprisingly cozy .
well , it &apos;s all yours .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i ... spilled my drink .
uh , yeah . i &apos;ll just get you another one .
oh , please don &apos;t .
bug out .
bug out .
bug ... out .
