7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12...
No peeking, Robby!
...13, 14...
Last game, everyone! We've got Robby's birthday cake soon!
This way, Wendy -- behind the pool house. - ...19, 20!
I've got a better spot.
Ready or not, here I come!
Wendy?
Wendy!
Come on, the game's over!
Wendy!
Wendy?
So, the secret to this is to go slow.
This ragu needs love, patience, and commitment.
I want to eat it. I don't want
to settle down and have kids with it.
Yeah, well, you should be so lucky
to find a man as good as my ragu.
Oh, this is nice.
It's a two-bedroom townhouse in Arlington.
Or would you rather be closer to D.C.?
You know, all the wonderful restaurants,
the Kennedy Center, the National Gallery...
Yeah, okay, where-- wherever,
just as long as I don't have to pretend to be a Redskins fan.
Taste.
Okay.
How is it?
That is good.
No!
That's bad.
It needs salt!
Okay.
Listen, you're gonna be 400 miles away.
Trust me, you're gonna want the taste of home cooking.
Okay.
Salt it.
Jane, you should really explore
all these different neighborhoods online.
I'm gonna add that to your checklist.
Oka-- I have a checklist?
Yes! I've started a little relocation journal for you.
Organization is vital for a successful move.
I said salt it, not brine it!
Oh. Oh, and you'll need to start a change-of-address list.
And maybe I should teach you to make the cannoli.
And, of course, you'll have to contact the DMV and the IRS.
Okay, enough!
I know you two are trying to help,
but I just cannot talk about this move anymore.
But I thought you were excited about the move.
I am.
At least, I want to be, but I just...
You know, when I think about being gone,
I think about not seeing you both every day.
I just -- You know, it's tough.
It sucks!
Wait, Ma, no.
Come on, don't do that.
It's just so far.
Wh-- Not you, too!
And I'm tried of crying.
Let's make cannoli, okay?
And let's make a list, okay? We love lists.
Come on, you guys.
If we start, we're never gonna stop. Okay?
So, ju--
Fine. I'll get the wine.
Want red or white?
Hey, did you get any feedback from that editor yet?
No, but I may not hear anything for several weeks.
Okay, you gave him three chapters to your mystery novel.
How long does this take?
Well, he's very busy.
I'm sure I'm not high on his priority list.
Well, you will be when he reads it.
Who can resist a stiletto to the temple?
Morning.
Detective.
Where are you going?
Ah, Korsak wanted me to canvass the neighborhood,
find out if anyone saw anything.
I think he knew the guy.
The victim?
Yeah.
He's not showing it, but he seems pretty upset.
Okay.
Victim was Walter Sokoloff --
retired carpenter, 77.
Neighbor saw him through the window and called it in.
Sokoloff.
Wasn't there a case file that you asked us to review
a couple years ago that has "Sokoloff" in it?
That's right. It was a young girl at a birthday party.
Blunt-force trauma, some DNA was recovered,
but no match in the database.
That was Wendy Sokoloff.
I was dating her older sister, Mary, when Wendy was murdered.
The victim is their father.
You sure you want to be here?
Well, yeah. It was a long time ago.
Um... any sign of forced entry?
No. Nothing seems to be missing, either.
Hey, look at this.
Looks like he was 20 years sober.
It also looks like he was old-school with his contacts.
Probably a number for Mary in there.
Okay, I'll make the call.
No, it should come from me.
Okay.
Matt, can you make sure to collect and bag
all the pillows in the house?
You got it, Dr. Isles.
You think he was smothered?
Yes.
There's evident cyanosis
and numerous petechial hemorrhages in the skin,
which is consistent with asphyxia.
And I'm seeing some fibers around the nose and mouth,
so we'll test that at the lab.
Killer attacks him in the chair, smothers him with a pillow.
There's a struggle.
We might be able to find DNA on his hands
or under his fingernails.
Looks like the killer finished the job right here on the floor.
You know, this doesn't look random.
It looks like he was targeted.
Hasn't this family suffered enough?
‭I checked the neighborhood.
Sokoloff was well-liked, no problems anyone knew about.
How's Sergeant Korsak doing?
Well, he says he's fine, but he seemed pretty shaken up.
How about you?
You still... okay with everything?
By "Everything," I assume you mean
our spontaneous decision to change our lives forever?
Yeah, that.
I feel more than okay.
I feel great. You?
Great.
I can't believe that we're actually getting married.
I know.
We have to tell everyone. No secrets this time.
Absolutely.
But... not right now.
Well, the proposal happened so quick,
I didn't have time to get you a ring.
Frankie, that's so sweet!
But we can't spend a lot.
We have to pay for the wedding and the honeymoon --
I-I promise not to spend a lot.
But...I want to do it right.
Fine.
You do that,
and I'll handle the honeymoon.
How are you gonna do that?
I don't know. I'll think of something.
I called Walter's daughter Mary. She's driving in.
Okay.
I found something interesting.
Walter volunteered for an organization
called the Victim Advocacy Group.
I know them.
Yeah, I interviewed a murder victim's family
who had a woman from that group with them.
She was a counselor or something?
Yeah.
Their volunteers help and advise victims' families
through the grief process.
They even offer guidance through the investigation and trial.
Sounds like Walter never really got over Wendy's death.
Maybe he figured out a way to channel that pain
into something good.
Well, let's look into all the cases he worked.
Maybe something will pop out.
All right.
All right, well, just let me know if you think of anything else.
Thank you very much.
Okay, well, that was Walter's sponsor.
He said he never heard of any problems or any threats.
How'd you do with the victims program?
I might have found something.
That's Vanessa Flores.
Her son was killed six years ago outside a bar in Roxbury.
The man who shot him was up for parole last week.
...why I urge you to deny parole.
So, Walter Sokoloff was her advocate?
He's been with the family since the time of the murder.
Here it is.
This is bullshit!
Nate said he's sorry! He's learned his lesson!
That's Wayne Fellows, the murderer's brother.
Yo, touch me again and I'll kick your ass.
You -- you think I won't?!
I'll kill you!
All right, well, let's bring Wayne Fellows in
and have a little talk.
Detective Rizzoli?
Hi.
Agent Davies.
That's the agent from Quantico? Mm-hmm.
Uh, this -- this is Nina Holiday.
This is Agent...Davies from Quantico.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure's all mine.
Is there, um, is there someplace we could talk?
Yeah.
Now a good time?
Yeah.
Privately.
Is something wrong? Is there a problem with the job?
No, no, there's no problem.
It's, um, I mean, it's -- it's related
but, um... but, you know, unrelated.
Not helping at all.
Yeah, um, see -- all right, the thing is, I, um,
I-I was just in town, and I thought,
um, do you have... time for dinner?
Like, a professional-colleagues dinner?
Just...dinner.
You know, a-a chance to talk about things.
What things?!
Important things.
‭It's nothing bad. I promise.
Come on. We had fun over drinks.
Right? I mean, didn't we?
We -- Yeah, we did.
'Cause I did.
I did, too.
Okay. I thought, "Let's go for 2 and 0."
All right.
Nothing fancy.
Beer and burgers it is.
Okay.
Okay.
Petechial hemorrhaging is present
in the mucosa of the lips and the interior of the mouth.
There's also evidence of pulmonary edema
due to suffocating.
Hi. Did you find anything?
Well, time of death is somewhere
6:00 and 9:00 yesterday evening.
The victim's hands were wiped clean,
but I did find trace underneath the fingernails.
DNA?
Uh, hopefully. It's being processed now.
So, there was also substantial bruising on the chest --
about the size and shape we'd expect
if the killer was on top,
using a knee to hold the victim down.
Okay. So you'll get back to me with the trace results?
Of course.
Everything okay?
It's silly.
I just heard from the editor.
And?
And he said that my chapters have potential,
that the science was fascinating,
the crime was complex.
Go, Maura!
Well, he also said that my characters felt flat
and that the setting didn't really come alive.
All right. So you spice it up a little bit.
I don't even know how to do that.
And what does he even mean? What am I supposed to do?
Add more more color and more smells?
Smell-- yes.
That -- that sounds like a perfect place to start.
I don't know that I should be
spending all of this time writing.
There are so many other things I could be doing.
Come on, Maura. You love writing.
Yeah, but maybe the truth is
that I'm not particularly good at it.
Why? Because you didn't hit it out of the park on your first try?
I'm wrong until I'm right on every murder we've got.
Okay, they're bringing in my suspect.
Jane.
Did you really like the chapters that you read?
Honestly. No sugarcoating.
Yes. I did.
But, you know, who cares what I think?
And who cares what that editor says?
I mean, if you don't believe in it, then who else will?
Believe.
Believe, Maura!
Believe!
Mary?
Vincent.
My goodness. I can't believe it's really you.
It's been too long.
I'm so sorry about your father.
I... I always liked him.
Daddy liked you, too.
And he never liked anyof my boyfriends.
I'm afraid I have to ask you some questions.
But there's no reason we have to do it there.
Do you still drink tea?
Come with me.
Nothing was the same after Wendy died.
It was like we didn't know how to be a family without her.
I remember.
You were so sweet those first couple of months.
Always coming around even when I told you not to.
I wanted to help.
But I was 18. I didn't know how.
I'm sure you remember how bad it got.
Dad was falling apart, drinking.
He couldn't hold a job.
Mom tried to be patient, but it was hard.
That's when Mom and I moved to Connecticut.
We found a 20-years-sober chip in his house.
We lost him for a long time,
but eventually, Dad cleaned up his act.
After he was sober,
he started volunteering with that victims group.
It became his whole life.
Did he mention anyone he was having a problem with?
Not to me.
He ever say anything about a Wayne Fellows?
We didn't really talk about his victim-advocate work.
He knew it upset me.
Dad never stopped thinking
about Wendy and what happened to her.
He never stopped looking for her killer.
But... I couldn't do that.
I couldn't keep dredging it up.
You did what you had to do to survive.
And now I have to do it all over again.
I don't even know a Walter Sokoloff.
You met him at your brother's parole hearing.
You threatened to kill him.
You mean the old man?
Is that what this is about?
What, he file a complaint or something?
Where were you yesterday between 6:00 and 9:00 P.M.?
Why?
Because that's when Walter Sokoloff was murdered.
Look, I said some things, but I-I didn't hurt him.
I was just pissed.
Yeah. We know that.
That's why you're sitting there.
You don't understand.
My brother Nathan's been up for parole twice,
and both times, the lady and the old man came.
She keeps saying all kinds of stuff about her son
so they won't let Nathan out.
He murdered her son.
It was a bar fight that got out of hand.
He hates himself for it. He really does.
Worrying about Nathan being in jail is just killing my mom.
She doesn't eat. She barely sleeps.
I don't know how much longer Ma's gonna last.
Must've made you really hate Walter Sokoloff --
him helping to keep your brother behind bars like that.
Wait -- you said 6:00 to 9:00?
I was at the Boathouse all night, watching the Sox.
Lots of people saw me.
Who'd they play?
Damn Yankees.
We kicked their asses, too.
Okay, I need some names.
So, you hadn't seen each other since you were teenagers?
Now she has grandchildren. It's crazy.
And were you two serious?
We thought we were.
But we lost touch when she and her mother moved away.
Well, it's so nice that you got to see her again.
But, what a sad reason for a reunion.
Her sister's murder was the first time
I'd ever been close to a crime.
It really got under my skin.
I think that's why I decided to be a cop.
Hey, Vince. I'm sorry for interrupting.
I just wanted to make sure that it was okay with you
if I switched up my work schedule.
Sure. What do you need?
I want to free up my afternoons so I could take care of T.J.
Well, you know, with Ron back in the picture
and Tommy and T.J. Coming back, your life sounds very full.
It's never been better.
Working at the Robber's not fulfilling enough?
I love my job.
I'm just not getting any younger.
I want to do the things that make me happy.
Yeah, Kiki said I should be doing the same thing.
Hey, you're the one that keeps bringing retirement up.
I just want what's best for you.
What's stopping you, Vince?
I don't know.
I just can't seem to pull the trigger.
Got to go. It's Jane.
Okay.
Sorry.
Bye, hon.
See ya.
Yeah, I think he wants me to be the one to push him to retire,
but I know it's got to be his decision.
Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.
Found at least 12 people
that said he was at the bar all night.
Let's hope Maura found something.
Please tell us you found some DNA,
and I'll... give you 100 bucks.
I did.
Well, I'm not gonna give you 100 bucks, but I'm really glad.
No take-backs.
We found the DNA in the trace under the victim's fingernails.
You get an ID?
No, but I did get a hit when I ran it through CODIS.
A hit with no name?
The DNA from our crime scene
matches the DNA from an unsolved homicide
that I logged into the system myself a few years ago --
the DNA found on Wendy's body in 1975.
The man who killed Walter Sokoloff
is the same man who killed his daughter 40 years ago.
The party was at the home of Carol and Oliver Davenport.
The Davenports were old money,
as were most of the other guests.
I thought Wendy was from your neighborhood.
She was.The Sokoloffs were from Dorchester.
Wendy was at Stanover Academy on a scholarship.
One of her classmates was Robby Davenport.
So she went to school with the rich kids.
Yeah.
Walter dropped her off at the party,
but he wasn't invited to stay.
The Davenports didn't associate
with people from our part of town.
Wendy was killed in the garden behind the shed --
blunt-force trauma to the head with a metal object.
A shovel was missing from the shed --
assumed to be the murder weapon.
The Sokoloffs told us that Wendy was wearing a locket
that was also missing.
Detectives believed that both the shovel
and the locket were taken by the gardener.
He was our prime suspect.
He died in 1986, so he's out.
And Maura confirmed that the DNA came from a Caucasian male.
The adult guests were sitting around the pool
while the kids played hide-and-seek.
They alibied each other.
Detectives also cleared two of the staff
that were working in the kitchen.
What about the kids?
Police interviewed them, but nobody saw anything.
Mostly, they got a lot of crying.
Let's run background checks on them as adults,
see if anything pops.
Got it.
Let's also look at these three again --
Oliver Davenport, his two oldest sons,
Garrett and William.
This the same Garrett Davenport
accused of raping that nurse a few years ago?
Yes, both of the older kids
were in and out of trouble their whole lives.
Well, Oliver told the police that both of his sons
were in the study with him at the time of the murder.
Basically, they're all each other's alibis.
Oliver's been protecting his kids all their lives.
Maybe he's still doing it.
But why kill her? There's no evidence of sexual assault.
Maybe Wendy saw something that she wasn't supposed to see.
Either way, we need to talk to them.
Well, I'll see what I can dig up on the family.
I'll keep looking into Walter's life --
try to figure out if he did anything
that brought Wendy's killer out of hiding after all these years.
Keep us updated.
This is everything from 1975.
I performed a review several years ago,
but I want to go over everything again.
Whatever new tests have been developed, let's use them.
Well, I can analyze the dirt and the hair
in the spectrophotometer.
And I can work up a virtual 3-D reconstruction of the wound.
The dress has deteriorated.
We'll be careful.
I just want to analyze any bodily fluids,
prints, blood -- whatever it can tell us.
If we can solve one of these murders,
we can solve both.
Hey, Ma.
Hey, honey. How are you? You want something to eat?
Ma, I can't stay.
Did you find Gram's earrings?
I did, and I forgot
what terrible taste your great-grandmother had.
Ooh. Wow. The stones are nice.
You sure you don't mind if I take them?
No, I don't mind.
They've been in my drawer for 20 years.
What are you gonna do with them?
Nothing.
Not for Nina?
Ma, please, just this once,
can you not ask any questions?
Okay, fine. Hey, I'm not one to pry.
I'm just saying that if somebody were to make a ring out of it,
the best place to go is Tony DePalma.
Bye, Ma.
Bye.
You're welcome!
菲利普斯和莱恩
Would you tell them we called -- again?
Secretary says, "Oliver Davenport isn't here.
And if you have any questions,
you should consider submitting them in writing."
God, lawyers suck.
You want to give it another hour?
What's that?
Oh, it's a journal I kept on the Wendy Sokoloff murder --
just articles, things I heard, my own suspicions.
You made this when you were a teenager?
Yeah.
I guess it was my first murder book, huh?
I never really believed the gardener did it,
but I couldn't find anyone else
who had a reason to kill her, either.
I was obsessed.
Persistence makes a great detective.
I learned that from you.
Well, you were born persistent.
Hey, how you feeling about that FBI job? You excited?
Yeah.
And then I'm completely terrified.
And then I'm confident
that it's the worst mistake I've ever made.
And then -- - Sounds exhausting.
It is.
It is.
You think it's the right move?
Eh. Don't ask me.
I find making big decisions harder the older I get.
What does your gut tell you?
I won't know unless I try.
I haven't known your instinct to be wrong very often.
That's not Oliver, but I think that's Robby Davenport.
Mr. Davenport?
Boston PD. Can we have a moment of your time?
Of course.
We've been trying to reach your father.
We haven't had much luck.
What about?
Murder investigation.
Is there a place we can talk?
Sure. Come in.
God, this cannot be happening again.
Do you have any idea how Wendy's death affected our family?
I imagine not nearly as much as it did the Sokoloffs.
I don't mean to be insensitive.
Mr. Sokoloff dying is horrible.
But Wendy was killed at our house, at my party.
Okay? It was devastating.
I had anxiety attacks for years afterwards.
Please understand we're not trying to be insensitive,
but it is important that we speak to your father.
Dad retired shortly after my mother passed.
We're actually in the process of selling the estate.
He doesn't really see anyone anymore.
Just a few questions.
Dad wouldn't know anything about Walter Sokoloff's death.
They barely knew each other, and that was decades ago.
Even so, we need to speak to him,
and we also need to speak to William and to Garrett.
My brothers?
What do they have to do with this?
They were at the birthday party, too.
We're just being thorough.
Unfortunately, my father and my brothers are unavailable.
When your father retired,
did it become your job to protect the Davenports?
My family has nothing to hide.
Well, we could get DNA samples from your father and your brothers
and then we could clear them all quickly.
If you've got a warrant, we're happy to comply.
I'm afraid I have an appointment.
My secretary will see you out.
I understand looking out for the family.
When did that include protecting murderers?
No, no, no, no.
You want to know the worst thing
about being undercover with a bunch of neo-Nazis?
I'm guessing it's hard to choose the worst.
It is. But the smell.
Honestly, it's like these guys never met a shower.
This probably isn't the most
romantic first-date conversation.
Yeah, so, how many times have you been shot?
Ugh. That was bad. Sorry.
Sorry. No, no, no. It's...
I know I -- I said "Beer and burgers,"
and this isn't beer and burgers.
No, no, no. No. It's delicious. Thank you -- really.
All right, look, um...
You're about to start a new job, all right?
A new city, your colleagues are people you've never met before.
It's not easy. I know.
I like you, Jane.
I really like you.
I knew that from the minute we met.
But...
But what?
What "But"? Why does everyone always have a "But"?
What? It's -- it's your wife?
Your girlfriend? Your boyfriend?
What? What "But"?
It's none of the above.
But the last thing I'd ever want to do is make you feel awkward,
start off on the wrong foot at work.
So I thought I'd come here,
tell you how I feel on your turf,
where there's no pressure.
And if you're not interested, I'll -- I'll back off,
and I promise we will forget this conversation ever happened.
Thank you.
You know, my priorities have always been family and work.
I know.
That's one of the many things I admire about you.
Well, that --  that means I don't really have a lot of time
for relationships.
I understand.
You know, um...
Maybe I could make time.
Five.
Sorry?
Been shot five times.
You've been shot five times?
Five times. How about you?
I've only been shot twice.
Twice is good. Twice is sexy.
No, one doesn't really count 'cause I shot myself.
I -- I shot myself on purpose. - What?
Yeah, well, it's -- it's a long story.
Jane! You ready?
I -- I'm Cameron.
I'm guessing you must be Maura.
Cameron.
Cameron...Davies?
Agent Davies?
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
What a pleasant surprise.
I hope you're... enjoying Boston.
Oh, yeah. Um...
Very much so.
Sorry, sorry.
Um, okay, I just need to get my stuff.
Well, don't hurry on my account.
Oh. Maybe I'll just hang this up for you.
Looks like it didn't quite make it all the way upstairs.
Um...can we, uh, take you to your hotel?
Yeah, that'd be -- that'd be great, if Maura doesn't mind.
Oh. No, not at all.
It'll give us a chance to get to know one another.
Yeah.
With your clotheson.
She's...
On a roll today. Okay.
You texted?
Is it gonna self-destruct?
Actually, it's working perfectly.
I modified our facial-recognition algorithm
to make a new program.
What's it doing?
Automatically registering for every sweepstakes in the nation
that gives away free trips.
You must really want to go on vacation.
You remember the missing locket that Wendy wore to the party?
Yeah.
These are new-item alerts.
Walter created tags for a silver opal locket
on eBay and other resale sites.
They alerted him every time
a locket of that description was listed for sale.
He was looking for his daughter's missing locket.
I looked through his financial records
and found evidence that he purchased at least 12.
The most recent was only two weeks ago.
We didn't find any in the house.
Maybe the killer took them.
I'll give Mary a call. Maybe she knows something about it.
Thanks.
Hope you win your vacation.
You failed to mention that Agent Davies was in town.
It was just dinner.
And dessert.
Actually, two desserts.
And breakfast.
He seems very nice.
Yeah, he is.
Is it something you think you might want to pursue in Washington?
Who knows what'll happen? But...
Yeah, I like him.
Well, good for you.
Um...large brew, no room, please.
Four pump, no water, soy chai with cinnamon and nutmeg.
Was there even any coffeeinthat?
Don't answer. Who cares?
Okay, last night, I was thinking about your book.
Oh. When did you have time?
And I think that you should just try something different.
Like what? - I don't know -- like, um...
like a change of scenery, you know?
Like, go to the library or --
Well. Thank you.
...write standing up or eating ice cream, you know?
Like, mix it up a little.
That's interesting.
Right?
‭If your pages need to "come alive,"
then, you know, go out and live a little.
Okay, I got to run.
We're gonna take another shot
at trying to talk to Oliver Davenport.
I got this.
Thank you.
And, hey, don't give up. Okay?
That's not the Dr. Isles I know.
See ya.
I'm sorry. Mr. Davenport isn't taking visitors.
Yeah, we just need a few minutes.
You can arrange an appointment through his office.
So what now?
We can't talk to the family.
We don't have enough for a warrant to get the Davenports' DNA.
We're not getting any further than they did back in '75.
That must be the service entrance that Korsak was talking about.
Looks like they're moving stuff out.
Yeah. You can't just walk in there.
I can if I'm invited.
You got a jacket?
How's this?
It's perfect.
You know what I just realized?
This might be one of the last cases that we work together.
Oh, no.
Come on. I could become part of some FBI task force.
I'll swoop in and make your life a living hell.
Oh, just like when we were kids.
Exactly.
Jane.
I wouldn't be a detective if it wasn't for you.
You know that, right?
You did that on your own, Frankie.
That was all you.
Be right back.
All right.
Everything must be handled with meticulous care.
They'll need more blankets.
Can you grab those and take them in?
These?
Yes, please.
Take them inside, all the way to the back.
The statues are in the salon.
Here you go, Mr. Davenport.
I'll get some water and be right back.
Mr. Davenport?
Hi. My name is Jane Rizzoli.
I'd like to...ask you a few questions.
Carol?
No, no, no. Uh, my name is Jane.
You're here.
Can I help you?
I'm Detective Rizzoli from Boston Police Department.
I was hoping to speak to Mr. Davenport,
but I see that's not really possible.
I'm afraid he's getting worse.
Carol?
I've missed you.
I missed you, too.
May I?
Of course.
It's okay.
It's okay.
‭It's okay.
I have to go, but I'm gonna come back, okay?
Okay?
Thanks.
Of course.
Maura processed Oliver Davenport's DNA.
It's a familial match to our killer's.
So our murderer was definitely one of the Davenports.
I just heard back from ICE.
Garrett's passport was scanned leaving the country the morning
after Walter was killed.
He may be running.
I'll start a warrant for Garrett and William's
phone numbers and credit cards.
That's Mary.
I asked her to look for the lockets that Walter bought.
Okay, um, Frankie, will you get in touch with Interpol,
have them keep tabs on Garrett.
Already on it.
But with the money these guys have,
they could be anywhere.
Don't worry. We'll find him.
She found a key to a safety-deposit box.
I'm meeting her at the bank.
No lockets?
No.
She told me earlier that none of the family
even knew where that locket came from.
They didn't give it to her?
No.
First time Walter saw it was
when he dropped Wendy off at the party.
She told him it was a gift.
From who?
She wouldn't say.
She jumped out of the car and ran off to
join the other kids before Walter got an answer.
Can you handle that warrant?
Yeah, sure. Go on.
Dr. Isles.
We're ready to begin the tests.
Kent, would you feel comfortable
managing the M.E.'s office for a few weeks if the need arose?
Of course.
Are you planning on going somewhere?
I'm not sure.
Let's see what this dress can tell us.
She sounds wonderful.
Oh, Kiki's the best.
I don't know how she ended up with me.
Oh, stop. I think she's a very lucky woman.
It's exciting, isn't it?
You and Kiki, me with my grandkids.
It's like a whole new chapter of our lives is just starting.
All the paperwork seems to be in order.
If I could just get your signature here...
Very good.
Box 1263.
Do you have the key?
Uh, yes.
Thank you.
I'll give you some privacy.
I told you.
He never stopped looking.
He tracked the ownership of the lockets back through years.
Hoping it would lead him to Wendy's murderer.
These look like purchase dates on the front.
What's wrong?
Nina said he bought a locket two weeks ago.
It's on the list, but it's not here.
That's why he was killed, wasn't it?
Daddy did it.
He finally found the right locket.
What's going on?
You're just in time.
Okay, let me guess-- You built a time machine,
and we're gonna go back to 1975 and solve the crime.
You know, Jane, it's your sarcasm I'm gonna miss most of all.
But actually, you're not far from wrong.
We're performing a vacuum metal deposition test on the dress.
The VMD technology's only been available in the past few years.
VMD has the potential to lift prints from surfaces
that were impossible to analyze at the time of the murder.
Like fabric.
Exactly.
Sorry.
Now, first, we will expose the dress to an aerosol of evaporated gold.
Real gold?
Yes.
Now, the secondary exposure is to evaporated zinc.
The zinc will attach itself to the gold anywhere that
there might be prints.
And then... nothing happens.
Wait for it.
It worked.
Those don't look like a man's prints.
No.
They look like a little boy's prints.
A kid did this to another kid?
Maura confirmed the prints match Robert Davenport's.
Good thing prints don't change as you age.
Not for Robert Davenport.
I told you he's not in today!
Where is he?
I don't know, but if he calls, I can tell--
This is a homicide investigation.
If I find out you withheld anything from us,
I swear to you I will make it my personal mission
to see you behind bars.
Security called and told Mr. Davenport
that you were coming up.
He went out back.
Where'd he go?
Uh, h-he told me to make sure
that the company helicopter was prepared for takeoff.
Where is that?
Jackson Airfield.
It's just a couple -- - We know where it is.
Notify the state police air wing to get a unit in the air now!
We're gonna lose him.
Shit!
There he is -- straight ahead!
Get us in the air!
Put it down!
Go! Go!
Boston Police.
Return to the ground and surrender your passenger.
Come on! Get us in the air!
I repeat -- surrender your passenger.
Put it down!
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.
Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you?
I'll take that as a "Yes."
Officer.
Looks like that persistence finally paid off.
You were right.
Yay! I was right!
I love being right!
What was I right about?
All of it --
not giving up on being a writer, mixing it up.
Good! So you're gonna finish writing the book?
I am. And I'm taking your advice.
I think a change of scenery is exactly what I need.
My editor wants the book to come alive,
and I know just how to do it.
I'm going to Paris for a month.
Paris?
Of course.
I mean, the whole book takes place in France.
So I'll soak up the atmosphere, live among the people.
I didn't actually mean a library...in France
when I suggested it.
But great! That sounds great.
I'm so excited.
Hi, Maura.
Hello.
I'm guessing you're canceling dinner.
Yeah. Just got called out to advise on a case.
I'm on a plane for Philly in an hour.
Yeah, the monkey suit kind of gave it away, so...
Sorry.
I can honestly tell you there's nothing
I'd rather be doing than having dinner with you.
Rain check?
Yeah.
Yeah, it'll be my treat -- in Washington.
It's a date.
Okay.
I'll, uh...
I'll...show you where to get
the best beer and burgers in town.
Okay.
Nice seeing you again.
Have a safe flight.
Thanks.
Bye.
That one might be a keeper.
I know! Unhhh! Okay.
Well, it appears my evening is free.
Dirty Robber?
Oui.
Ca a l'air fantastique.
C'est von b-- Blblblblblbl.
All right.
Oh, he's cute.
I know!
Here you go.
I may have to go back to my afternoon shift.
You people are exhausting.
But we're excellent tippers.
Do you need some help?
No, that's ok.
Janie will help me.
Why do I got to help?
You want me to send
you frozen ragu every week?
Yes, I do.
Yep, yes, ma'am.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was...I just--
I won.
What?
I won.
You won what?
Our honeymoon.
I entered a sweepstakes, and won a trip for two to Antigua.
Wait, you actually won a sweepstakes?
Can you believe it?
I mean, technically I did enter 5762 of them,
using a program I created,
but we won!
Well, I just picked up this.
Frankie. It's so beautiful.
So...
So we'll tell everybody now.
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.
Come on.
I'm very glad you're all here.
I want you to be the first to know.
I filed for my retirement today.
Congradulations!
Congradulations, Sergeant.
I hope you're ready for me to be around a lot more.
Oh, yes, I can't wait.
Later?
Later.
Well, cheers to Vince Korsak,
the greatest partner,
husband, boss, colleague,
friend a person could never ask for.
Cheers.
Tout est en train de changer.
Really? Is this how it's gonna be now?
"Everything is changing."
Well, that's true in every langue.
