welcome to the lost woods resort .
maybe you remember our friend ,
vivian darkbloom .
you check into the lost woods
because you don &apos;t want to be found .
what are you doing here ?
i was curious . he &apos;s the father of my son .
yeah , he deserves to know that .
i didn &apos;t kill alison , but jenna thinks i did .
that &apos;s it ?
i went back .
you &apos;re lying .
she was alive when i left .
meredith got the job .
the job at rosewood high .
well , aria , i forgot you &apos;re still a student here .
change of plan . i &apos;ll see you soon .
is it a bad time ?
what are you doing here ?
my doctors released me .
in the middle of the night ?
hanna , i need your help .
my parents are forcing me to go back to school ,
and i &apos;m so scared .
mona ...
everyone knows what i &apos;ve done ,
and i have no one in my corner .
if you &apos;re expecting me and my friends to forgive you ...
i don &apos;t expect them to , but , hanna , you &apos;re different .
wren said you were my guardian angel .
he said that you stood up for me .
you are not defenseless , mona .
you spent the last two years majoring in torture .
so you don &apos;t believe that a person can get better ?
hanna , i had a breakdown ,
but i &apos;ve turned a corner .
i &apos;m on new meds , everything &apos;s changed .
i &apos;m not proud of who i was .
just try to see me for who i am . now .
i do see you , mona . you &apos;re freaking me out .
hanna !
who &apos;s that ?
yeah , grandma ?
are you alone in there ? i heard voices .
uh , no , no . it &apos;s just me .
i &apos;m ... reading out loud . go back to sleep .
thank you .
he &apos;s here to install the new alarm . sorry , babe .
i didn &apos;t think they &apos;d get to the second floor
until after you left for school .
you &apos;re putting an alarm on my window ?
on every window . your mom wants the best system around .
there &apos;s an app where i can turn it on remote from my phone .
so how will i know when it &apos;s on ?
well , considering what &apos;s been happening in this town
for the past two years , think 24 / 7 .
did you eat ?
yeah , i &apos;ll grab something .
hilary reynolds called .
she &apos;s so angry , she can barely speak .
wait , garrett &apos;s mother ? why ? what did she want ?
she wants her son back .
but she can &apos;t have that .
so she &apos;s going after the rosewood police .
i told her i would be there
tomorrow night at the community meeting .
why would you go to that ?
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
she &apos;s right . they let an innocent man out of jail ,
and provided no protection for him .
i don &apos;t think of the word &quot; innocent &quot; when i think of garrett .
evidently , you &apos;re not alone .
looks like somebody else thought it was their right
to take justice into their own hands .
dad , alison &apos;s murder has never been solved .
you still think garrett did it ?
do you ?
i &apos;m gonna be late . are my sneakers downstairs ?
i &apos;m not so sure you &apos;ll go on that run .
your mom and i just aren &apos;t comfortable
with you being out after dark .
dad , i raised $ 274 in pledges .
i know .
you &apos;re welcome to have paige over ,
but you are not going out .
so this is the new world order ?
we &apos;re gonna have to face off with mona in school every day ?
she told hanna that she &apos;s better now . better at what ?
i &apos;ll tell you what . she sneaks in my house past midnight ,
i &apos;m sleeping with a crowbar under my pillow .
the only question is , do we ignore her ?
here &apos;s a hint . yes .
mona had serious insight into what happened to maya .
what if she could tell us why garrett was killed ?
so now you think mona &apos;s the keeper of more secrets ?
she certainly knows all of ours .
what if she has some kind of connection to the n.a.t. club ?
spencer , that club ended while she was still loser mona .
pre @-@ lasik and metal mouth .
if those pervs didn &apos;t even wanna peep in her window ,
why would they wanna hang out with her ?
maybe she was peeping at them .
look , two members of the n.a.t. club are dead .
okay , maybe the person who killed ali is still freaked out
that there &apos;s a tape floating around somewhere out there .
did you ...
did you ever ask your dad ?
ask him what ?
about what garrett said .
you know , about him meeting up with ali that night .
my dad and i are finally getting along .
i &apos;m not gonna slap him with some whacked @-@ out story
garret made up so he could clear his own name .
i hear you , but--
but what ?
spence , garrett lied about a lot .
why are we suddenly gonna believe anything he ever said ?
what &apos;s that ?
someone baked you some muffins and left &apos; em at the door .
who &apos;s &quot; m &quot; ?
mona .
mona ?
you don &apos;t have to eat these .
i &apos;ve got huevos rancheros ,
pork sausage , and hash browns .
please stop .
are you sick ?
i could be .
is this mona the same mona ...
yeah . she wants a fresh start .
are you ready to give it to her ?
it &apos;s complicated , grandma .
i hear you , honey .
when cousin heshy came back ,
no one wanted to touch him with a ten @-@ foot pole .
who &apos;s cousin heshy ?
alberta &apos;s youngest .
he was always a little off ,
but in high school , he jumped the tracks .
what &apos;d he do ?
one morning at breakfast , he served his mom and dad
two bowls of rusty nails with milk poured over &apos; em .
and when they refused to eat ,
he snatched up a fistful ,
and just squeezed until blood came out .
i &apos;m sorry . how are we related to this person ?
oh , no , my point is ,
they sent him away for about four months .
he &apos;s been fine ever since .
so you really think people can change ?
heshy did .
i mean , the thing is , what &apos;s done is done .
and when the rink gets icy ...
yeah , i &apos;m exhausted .
i can &apos;t deal . i &apos;m taking a sick day .
hanna , you go to school .
maybe you need to let this girl
have a chance to win you back .
you know ,
if i were her , i &apos;d fight to the death
to have you as my friend .
i &apos;m basically under house arrest .
长跑俱乐部筹款会
my mom &apos;s now using my dad to squeeze information outta me
about halloween , the lighthouse .
what have you told him ?
nothing .
if he knew half the crap we &apos;d been through ,
he &apos;d ship me off to guam .
thought you were playing mona &apos;s bodyguard .
okay , i said i &apos;d be around for her .
i &apos;m thinking maybe we all should be her friend .
i mean , if mona knows why garrett died ,
right after he told that story about aria &apos;s dad--
stop .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
we &apos;re not gonna talk about that .
no , go ahead .
talk about it . just do it when i &apos;m not here .
aria--
what &apos;s next ?
are we all gonna start wondering
if my dad was on the halloween train , too ?
what ?
you actually believe that my own dad would drug me ,
and then lock me in a box .
hello , aria .
what are you doing here ?
yeah , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
welcome to mona 2.0 .
aria , i &apos;m sorry . i wasn &apos;t trying--
don &apos;t worry about it .
none of us really believe your dad--
i know .
i overreacted .
the thing is , garrett did say it ,
and it &apos;s really freakin &apos; hard
when you can &apos;t look at your boyfriend , and now your own dad ,
without ...
without what ?
wait , what &apos;s with ezra ?
i still haven &apos;t told him about ...
his son .
yeah . you know that i plan on telling him
every time we &apos;re together ,
but i just bail .
where &apos;s mrs. grizzuti ?
uh , i &apos;m guessing she had her baby .
and now meredith &apos;s her replacement ?
please stick a fork in my neck .
the check and balance system was established
so that no branch could wield absolute power
over another branch .
why do we think this was so important to our founding fathers ?
aria .
what ?
look , guys , i don &apos;t know what mrs. grazzuti &apos;s take was ,
but while i &apos;m here , no phones in class .
i wasn &apos;t ... i wasn &apos;t on my phone .
yeah , you were .
tell you what . give it to me .
this way , you won &apos;t even be tempted .
it was important to our founding fathers
because they wanted to be sure that no one had absolute power .
aria .
can you stay for a few minutes , please ?
i guess since you travel in a pack ,
you can all stay .
just so we don &apos;t get off on the wrong foot ,
let &apos;s be clear .
i have a job to do ,
and if you ladies want to graduate ,
so do you .
look , i saw what you were texting .
you &apos;re in this class to discuss american history ,
not mine . got it ?
yeah .
thank you . have a nice day .
mona , wait . mona , i couldn &apos;t leave aria .
no , that &apos;s okay . i get it . it must be really tough for her .
mona , what is it ? is that a brain ?
close your door .
close your locker .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here . what are you doing ?
lucas , what did she say to you ? who did that ?
wait , wait . someone stole that from the bio lab ?
they have cow brains up there ?
i didn &apos;t even think--
that &apos;s because you got excused
from dissection based on vegetarian grounds .
guys , people are gonna think that we put that in her locker .
it wasn &apos;t vegetarian , it was humanitarian .
are you still hating on me ?
possibly .
guys , pay attention . people are gonna think that was us .
how ? when ?
we were all being held hostage by meredith .
it wasn &apos;t in her locker before first period .
so now we &apos;re depending on meredith to be our alibi ?
see you in jail .
i gotta say , mona &apos;s a lot stronger than me .
i would &apos;ve lost it .
i feel sorry for her .
yeah , me , too .
okay , are we done feeling sorry ?
because she &apos;s done a lot worse to us , guys .
a lot .
mona , you don &apos;t think we had anything
to do with that , do you ?
of course not .
why would you dump on me after i helped you ?
helped me ?
figure out who the creep was that killed your girlfriend .
but i know that there &apos;s still bad blood between us ,
and i know that i have to earn your trust ,
and prove that i &apos;m worthy .
but i will . you &apos;ll see .
i &apos;m better now .
sure you wanna do this ?
face it , caleb .
we were never under the radar .
did you hear about mona ?
yeah , i did . sorry i missed that .
something weird is going on .
do you think it &apos;s possible that mona did that to herself ?
it &apos;s possible , but something &apos;s definitely going on
between mona and lucas .
why is he limping ?
maybe she kicked him .
you &apos;ve gotta talk to him .
find out if he hurt that leg on halloween .
i &apos;m lost .
when aria was in that box ,
she stabbed someone who was trying to throw her off the train .
that was weeks ago .
and it was also a dirty old screwdriver .
maybe it didn &apos;t heal .
just ... please .
talk to him , okay ?
okay .
i couldn &apos;t pick up her call because my phone was turned off .
dad , i have classes .
i can &apos;t step out every ten minutes
just to report to mom that i &apos;m still alive .
no , not straight from school .
i have work .
i &apos;m supposed to give up my job now , too ?
what ? yes , yes . i &apos;ll come home right after work .
bye .
welcome to the lost woods resort .
it would &apos;ve been nice to have had more warning ,
but we knew she couldn &apos;t stay in that place forever .
do you still wanna run after school ?
yeah , sure .
i missed you .
how come i didn &apos;t hear from you last night ?
i fell asleep early . didn &apos;t get your message .
can i ask you something ?
promise that you won &apos;t get upset .
ask .
do you think that jenna transferred schools
because after garrett , she was afraid that she might be next ?
jason is the last member of the n.a.t. club left .
i know that she wasn &apos;t an official member ...
why do you obsess about this stuff ?
how can i not obsess about it ?
the cops still don &apos;t know who killed garrett .
they can &apos;t even find the gun he was shot with .
unbelievable .
look who she &apos;s cozying up to now .
spencer , leave it alone .
no , i can &apos;t .
he &apos;s basically hugging a hand grenade .
he was cleaning up mona &apos;s locker .
he looked right through me .
maybe it wasn &apos;t him .
it was him .
maybe creepy harold has a creepy twin .
why does he have mona &apos;s stuff ?
maybe he &apos;s returning it .
you &apos;ve worn this ?
yeah , in every marathon i &apos;ve ever run .
here . wear it .
it &apos;ll bring you luck .
no . i can &apos;t take that .
what if i lose it ?
i &apos;ll have to lose you .
that was a joke .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
nothing .
nothing . i &apos;m just ...
guess i &apos;m just deciding if i really want to do this thing .
no , no , no . you have to do this .
it &apos;s for a good cause , friends are counting on you ,
and i pledged half of last year &apos;s unemployment .
you &apos;ll be fine .
just ... change your shoes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . it just might be my mom .
she called in sick today ,
but i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s &apos; cause it was meredith &apos;s first day .
is it your mom ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna have to ... swing by her place
and do a little hand holding .
she &apos;s pretty bugged out .
she &apos;s lucky to have you , since i can &apos;t .
call me ?
i will .
oh , under ten ! beat it .
i think we earned some hot tub .
spence , you want me to fire it up ?
yeah . just give me a second .
hey , jason .
hey there , spencer .
what &apos;s going on with you and mona ?
did you go to her or did she come up to you ?
look , i know that her first day back wasn &apos;t exactly a bubble bath .
okay , but ... you should be careful .
what am i missing here ?
jason , she &apos;s dangerous .
ian and garrett are both dead .
jenna &apos;s awol .
i &apos;m starting to think that mona might have--
got it . i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
toby can hear this . he knows her resume .
she once tried to kill him by unscrewing a piece of scaffolding .
she cannot be trusted .
people around here used to say the same thing about me .
i like to give people the benefit of the doubt
before i cut them off .
good @-@ bye . thanks for the tip .
you sure you didn &apos;t tell her ?
why would i tell mona that ezra has a kid ?
i don &apos;t know . but i &apos;m telling you
if ezra would &apos;ve opened that door--
he didn &apos;t , all right , so just breathe .
what &apos;d you do with the basket ?
i trashed it . why ? do you want the jelly beans ?
aria &apos;s right , hanna . mona &apos;s up to something .
it &apos;s not a coincidence the first day she &apos;s back ,
harold &apos;s also there , and somehow doesn &apos;t recognize us .
i &apos;m not saying it wasn &apos;t weird .
i just think maybe he took the job
because he wanted to see her .
why would he want to see her ?
she spent a lot of time there .
maybe they were buddies .
the buddy @-@ moon &apos;s over .
we need to bust into creepy &apos;s closet
and see what else he saved for her .
did you talk to lucas ?
he &apos;s not feeling very chatty .
but i did find something else .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a transcript from the meeting the principal had
with mona and her parents last week .
how did you get this ?
there &apos;s perks to knowing the school &apos;s pass code .
what are we looking for ?
page two .
turns out mona &apos;s parents did not
want her to come back to rosewood high .
it was mona who begged to come back in .
wait . i thought she told you her parents were forcing her .
i &apos;m guessing she lied .
mona &apos;s back to take care of unfinished business .
i gotta go .
hey , feed me . i &apos;m starving .
did mona sign that card on the muffin basket with &quot; m &quot; or &quot; a &quot; ?
could we just take a second before we--
before we what ?
let her destroy our lives again ? no .
if ezra finds out that he has a kid through &quot; a &quot; --
don &apos;t give &quot; a &quot; all the power , aria .
tell fitz he has a son .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because that son has a mother , and she asked me not to .
yeah , and every day that goes by is another day
that kid goes without meeting his dad ,
and believe me ,
that kid might be dealing with it for a long time .
what are you thinking about ?
i &apos;m not .
what are you stewing about ?
why doesn &apos;t jason get it ?
he knows that mona &apos;s dangerous .
jason &apos;s a big boy . he can take care of himself .
yeah , but nobody &apos;s got his back .
i &apos;ve got my friends , i &apos;ve got you . he &apos;s completely alone .
what was that ? did you hear that ?
hello ?
hey , is someone out there ?
relax .
i wanna go inside .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this right now .
come in .
hi there .
i wasn &apos;t even sure anyone was home , it &apos;s so quiet .
mike went to wyatt &apos;s to study .
so ... how was school today ?
did you talk to meredith ?
i did .
i &apos;d completely forgotten that you were in that class .
i can &apos;t drop it . i need it to graduate .
why should you ?
sounds like you handled that situation like an adult .
thank you for that .
what did meredith tell you ?
well , she said that you and your friends
were cautiously welcoming .
that &apos;s the most that any new teacher can expect .
god knows , i have been there .
kids can be very cruel .
hey , dad .
did you like alison ?
what ?
like , what did you think of her as a person ?
i like all of your friends .
why do you ask that ?
i just know that mom had some issues with her .
she thought ali was entitled .
i think most of that just comes from
being at an awkward age .
you never spent any real time alone with her , though , did you ?
why would i have ?
you still really miss her , huh ?
yeah .
ever since i was little and all through junior high
i was considered , a loser .
i was humiliated , picked on , and tortured .
and as hard as all that misery and torture was ...
she sent this to you ?
yeah , and everyone else in cyber space .
it has 1,600 likes .
that child is more twisted than my toes .
she &apos;s trying way too hard .
you were the one who told me to give her a second chance .
that was before i saw her campaign .
right now , i think mona may be the best argument we got
against human cloning .
before you turn this off ,
or throw something at the screen ,
please just hear me out .
i &apos;ve been in radley for over seven months now .
and i wanna tell you about what i ...
lucas ?
hi . i know you &apos;re on your way out .
no , no . come in .
i don &apos;t wanna keep you .
seriously , just come in .
could you get this to caleb ?
i tried to find him , but i guess he &apos;s not living in the same spot .
what is this ?
it &apos;s the last of the money i owe him .
took me a while to get it .
do you want something to drink or anything ?
no , i &apos;m good .
what happened to your leg ?
oh , i had an accident skateboarding .
it &apos;s kind of hard to explain .
what happened between you and mona ?
nothing . nothing . i haven &apos;t spoken to her in months .
does mona have something on you , lucas ?
did you do something that you really regret ?
did someone stab you in that leg on halloween ?
we &apos;ll talk about this another time .
no , i need answers .
why is she suddenly back at school ? why is she coming back ?
hanna , yesterday wasn &apos;t her first day back .
she was sneaking out of there
way before she had the doctor &apos;s permission .
why ? where was she going ? what was she doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s the best that i can do .
okay . i get it .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
i know that you ultimately have to own up ,
own up to what you &apos;ve done ,
and what &apos;s been done to you ,
and then you have to learn to forgive yourself .
she shoots , she scores .
un @-@ freakin &apos; -believable .
by tuesday ,
that &apos;ll be playing in airports and doctor &apos;s offices .
we need more bottles .
i don &apos;t believe it .
what is she doing here ?
spence .
hey , spencer , how are you ?
i &apos;m good . how are you ?
she &apos;s such a piece of work .
yep . that &apos;s called greeting your converts .
can i ask you something ?
have you ever ...
thought about what your life would be like
if your dad had been around
when you were , like , six or seven ?
dumb question . i shouldn &apos;t have asked that .
no . no , it wasn &apos;t dumb .
yeah . when i was young , i ... i looked for him everywhere .
in the streets , in stores .
i even looked for him in my sleep .
but when i was about 13 , i just stopped .
why ?
i guess i was just tired of ...
using all that energy , ya know .
i just needed to focus on me .
and i &apos;m totally fine with the way things turned out .
really . but ...
i &apos;d be lying if i said there weren &apos;t days
that i wish i could replace the guy i made up in my head
with a real person .
if you look at your maps , you &apos;ll see four checkpoint stations .
the run will end in front of the school ,
where you &apos;ll pick up your medal
and a complimentary swag bag .
we will begin in three minutes .
excuse me . who &apos;s singing the national anthem ?
oh , we really didn &apos;t plan on--
i &apos;ll do that .
* oh , say can you see *
look , you guys . if we ditch the track right before checkpoint two ,
we can cut through the woods behind school .
how are we getting in ?
it &apos;s not locked . they &apos;re keeping the bathrooms open for people
that are working the finish line .
are you sure that emily can &apos;t meet us ?
yeah , unless she can escape fort fields .
why is your grandmother singing ?
because she can .
* wave *
* o &apos;er the land of the free *
i think mona was on the halloween train that night .
say that again .
* home of the *
* brave *
* on the shore , dimly seen ... *
i don &apos;t think this &apos;ll last too long .
you okay here by yourself ?
yeah . is there an app to let me crack open a window ?
don &apos;t need to . i &apos;ll adjust the thermostat downstairs .
okay , i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
emily ?
em , how did you get here ?
long story . just do me a favor .
don &apos;t call or text me until tomorrow .
this isn &apos;t working .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s a paper clip .
you have to use a bobby pin .
have i taught you nothing ?
the bag was right here , wasn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s the book he was writing in .
what does it say ?
looks like he was writing a long letter to mona ,
&apos;cause he thinks that this is her diary .
is it ? was this in the motel room ?
yeah , it was , but , you guys , this isn &apos;t mona &apos;s .
this is ali &apos;s .
is this the same one you saw in mona &apos;s lair ?
i &apos;m positive .
let me see this .
aria , is this about your dad ?
so you &apos;re department chair now .
you &apos;re a powerful man , mr. montgomery .
we &apos;re not having this conversation again .
fine . i &apos;d rather not talk .
that &apos;s gonna cost you
same amount works for me .
oh , does it ?
well , you &apos;re out of luck .
that person &apos;s not in my life anymore .
it ended months ago .
will that make it any easier for mrs. montgomery ?
i mean , it did happen .
it &apos;s time for you to go , alison .
if a student called the dean
and told him that meredith was flipping out
because one of her professors
wiped his feet on her after he--
you make that call , you &apos;ll be very sorry .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll just start with your wife .
maybe i &apos;ll call when i &apos;m alone .
i cannot give you that kind of money again .
ella will know it &apos;s missing .
you can take some time to figure it out .
i &apos;m leaving town to visit my nana .
i &apos;ll be back labor day weekend .
does that work for you ?
excellent . i &apos;ll see you then .
have a nice week , mr. montgomery .
aria .
don &apos;t .
emily , put this in your jacket .
maybe we should leave it here .
if he knows that it &apos;s missing ,
he &apos;ll think it was one of us .
us ? he doesn &apos;t even know who you are .
just take it .
give it to me .
what are you doing down here ?
um , all of the bathrooms upstairs were full ,
so we came down here ,
but we can use the ones on the second floor .
we &apos;re sorry . you guys , come on .
what have you got there ?
give it to me !
spencer ?
what &apos;s going on ? are you guys okay ?
yeah , we &apos;re fine .
we just had to get something i accidentally threw away .
长跑俱乐部筹款会
thank god you came down there .
how did you know we were there ?
i got to the finish line early ,
and then , i saw the three of you go in that back door .
it doesn &apos;t even matter . we &apos;re just so lucky you were here .
oh , my god !
mona !
get back !
mona !
no , i didn &apos;t get any messages ,
only my daughter &apos;s .
we accidentally switched phones .
that &apos;s right .
thanks for the update , sir . good night .
that was your principal .
it was that new teacher , miss sorenson ,
who got hurt by that stunt .
meredith ?
you call her by her first name ?
no , i just ... she &apos;s ...
never mind .
all right . maybe we should stop fighting
about why i won &apos;t let you out ,
and start talking about why you &apos;re not letting me in .
have i been gone that long ?
emmy , i know that i don &apos;t fully understand
everything that you &apos;ve been going through .
but i know what it &apos;s like to lose people .
and the only thing that gets me through that
is knowing that i &apos;m coming home to my family .
i don &apos;t wanna be your gate keeper , emmy .
i wanna be your dad .
ever since i was little , and all through junior high ...
i was considered a loser ...
baby .
i think you &apos;ve seen
enough of her for one day , don &apos;t you ?
how &apos;s meredith ?
i just took her home from the e.r.
doctors dressed her burn ,
gave her some painkillers , kept her calm .
i didn &apos;t think she should be home alone ,
so i invited her to stay over .
she &apos;s here ?
no .
no , she didn &apos;t see that as a very tempting offer ,
based on what happened earlier tonight .
what is it ?
it was put on meredith &apos;s clipboard ,
sending her over to the storage shed .
did one of your friends write that ?
my friends ?
i know what they &apos;re capable of .
what are you saying ?
does meredith think that we sent this to her ?
yeah , she sure does .
now that she &apos;s told me
the truth about what happened on that first day ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s such a crazy thought .
dad , we would never ...
did you and your friends do this to her ?
yes or no ?
no . no .
speak up now , aria , while you can .
these kind of secrets come back to haunt us .
what about yours ?
what does that mean ?
nothing . nothing .
will you close my door , please ?
hey .
heard i missed some fireworks at the finish line .
yeah .
but mona walked away without a scratch .
look , i won &apos;t say this again .
you don &apos;t have to . i hear you this time .
good night .
hey , aria , what &apos;s up ?
&quot; a &quot; set us up .
what ?
that &apos;s why meredith opened that shed .
&quot; a &quot; sent her over there , and made it look like we did .
does &quot; a &quot; go by the name of mona ?
is this her way of proving to us that she &apos;s worthy ?
hey , i gotta go .
wait , aria .
is it your dad ? do you wanna come over and stay at my place ?
he &apos;s never gonna let that happen .
i think this bandage will cover it .
