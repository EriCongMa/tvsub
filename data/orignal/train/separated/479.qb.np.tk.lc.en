maya . gave her a lift from the gas station .

oh , there &apos;s another storm coming .
who knows how long that &apos;ll take ?
oh , you poor thing . you &apos;re shivering .
you have to come inside .
we can &apos;t let her stay out here . she &apos;ll freeze to death .
how does a nice warm shower sound ?
it sounds amazing .
come on with me , sweetheart .
let me help you with this .
i &apos;ve got it .
i am crazy about sam . i like him , like him , like him ,
but i just--i wish he was more like out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box
take charge kind of guy .
ok , well , what do you mean by &quot; take charge &quot; ?
ok . valentine &apos;s day . i planned everything ,
from dinner to dessert ,
and by dessert , i mean me .
and i texted him to tell him about it and he wrote back ,
&quot; sounds great . &quot;
octopus emoticon .
i &apos;m not quite sure i know what that means ,
but i guess it &apos;s kind of sweet .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
not you , too .
ok , baby girl ,
did you tell him about this ?
did i tell him ...
i wanted him to take charge ?
not really .
not at all .
ok . let me let you in on a little secret .
guys , we don &apos;t do well with subtle clues . ok ?
you gotta be direct , straight up .
just tell him exactly what you want .
i learn something from you every day .
ok , what about you ? spill it .
what are you doing for valentine &apos;s day ?
i was thinking about a little candlelit dinner at le donkle &apos;s
overlooking the potomac .
ohh ... that is romantic .
look at us . we &apos;re all grown up . we &apos;re like ...
matt damon and ben affleck .
and savannah and sam .
oh , can sam be jennifer garner ?
jj ?
jj .
jj .
jj ! you &apos;re back .
and ready to get to work .
how you feeling ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t get me wrong , i love my boys to death ,
but i was starting to get a little stir crazy .
well , let &apos;s do this .
yes .
do you want some tea ?
welcome back .
you sure two weeks is enough time ?
oh , i &apos;m fine . and , yes ,
will made sure i got clearance from two doctors .
glad you &apos;re ok . we should get started .
yes , sir .
pittsburgh field office has reported two murders
in the past 48 hours .
both of them were strangled ,
then stripped down to their underwear
and then dumped off of a highway .
have we i.d. &apos; d the victims ?
no , not yet .
the guy has a lot of rage .
he &apos;s using some kind of ligature ,
maybe a strap ?
it looks like he &apos;s choking them intermittently ,
allowing them to breathe only when he permits it .
but the m.e. report says neither was sexually assaulted .
that &apos;s odd given the fact that 80 % of crimes against women
involve some sort of sexual component .
well , it &apos;s the choking that gets him off .
some form of erotic asphyxiation filtered through
a psychopath &apos;s need for power and control .
ok , what is this ? are they wrapped in shower curtains ?
strangely , yes . which is why i &apos;m checking
with a number of manufacturers
to see where these were distributed from .
the m.o. says sexual sadist ,
but the curtain reads as remorse .
sexual sadists don &apos;t feel remorse .
maybe it &apos;s his shame ?
or maybe he &apos;s impotent .
he doesn &apos;t rape because he can &apos;t .
and the embarrassment of not being able to perform
manifests in him wrapping up his victims .
he doesn &apos;t want to look at them after he kills them .
which points to either symbolic
or a literal emasculation .
we need to find out .
wheels up in 30 .
ok , your homework was to dig deep
and rediscover what sparks your passion .
how &apos;s that been going ?
fine , once he ...
finds the time .
oh , here we go .
i didn &apos;t say it was your fault , ok ?
i &apos;m just--this is what i &apos;m talking about .
look , you two have already tried separation ,
so the next step is divorce .
but since you &apos;re here ,
i &apos;m assuming you want to save this marriage .
so i &apos;ll ask again ,
how have the last couple of nights been ?
fine .
a start .
this is never going to work
unless you start expressing your feelings .
oh , right , right .
the process .
ok . for the next couple of days
i &apos;d like to increase your sessions .
the focus should be about getting back to the basics of being a couple .
i want you guys to be more spontaneous .
go out and enjoy a night on the town .
last night we did something kind of spur of the moment .
and what was that ?
we checked into a motel .
where &apos;s alan ?
sounds romantic .
there was a spark or two .
it was like our first time all over again .
i get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it .
now we &apos;re finally getting somewhere .
you gotta trust the process .
let &apos;s build on this .
any plans of doing it again ?
definitely .
absolutely .
author jennifer smith wrote ,
&quot; marriage is a mosaic you build with your spouse ,
millions of tiny moments that create your love story . &quot;
this guy &apos;s definitely mobile .
we might be looking at a long @-@ distance trucker .
garcia already checked into it .
she didn &apos;t find any major routes in or around the dump sites .
speaking of dump sites , our most recent victim
was found 50 miles from where she was last seen .
it looks like security cameras picked her up at a gas station
but never saw who she left with .
maybe that &apos;s where he found her .
it &apos;s the perfect hunting ground .
it fits the witness &apos; statements .
according to the cashier , the victim had been there
for several hours asking customers for a ride .
well , she lived locally .
she could have made it home in time .
instead , she waited .
she must have been headed some distance .
she could be from anywhere .
maybe that &apos;s why the unsub chose her .
he doesn &apos;t just pick victims of opportunity .
he targets women who won &apos;t be missed .
good news , crime @-@ fighters .
i tracked the shower curtains this creep
has been using to burrito his victims .
turns out they &apos;re commercial grade ,
sold in bulk to a bunch of economy motels ,
a list of which i just sent you .
it makes sense .
it &apos;s a secure secondary location .
either he doesn &apos;t want to draw attention to his home
or someone is living with him .
rossi , you and morgan go to the m.e.
jj and reid , go through garcia &apos;s list of motels .
blake and i will go to the field office
and cover victimology with agent west .
local police are canvassing restaurants and gas stations
urging female hitchhikers to be on high alert .
it won &apos;t completely deter the unsub ,
but hopefully it will limit his available victim pool .
where are we on identifying the victims ?
nothing yet . you guys can work in here .
thanks .
we should see if there are any unsolved murders
that match this unsub &apos;s m.o.
the transient nature of the victimology
suggests there may be bodies we haven &apos;t discovered yet .
i &apos;ll have my guys get right on it .
thank you .
these women were just looking for a ride .
they never saw the attack coming .
25 an hour , 2 @-@ hour minimum .
yeah , we &apos;d just like to ask you a couple questions .
we &apos;ve been canvassing several motels in the area .
it &apos;s possible a murder &apos;s been committed in one of the rooms .
i haven &apos;t seen or heard anything .
do you mind if we take a peek at your guest log
or surveillance footage ?
we don &apos;t have cameras .
we &apos;re a cash only , no questions asked type of establishment .
would you mind taking a look at these ?
do you recognize anyone ?
never seen them before .
this might sound strange , but are any of your rooms
missing a shower curtain ?
i noticed it wasn &apos;t there this morning .
the room was totally trashed .
did a real number on the toilet .
got someone coming out to take a look later on today .
did you try plunging it ?
do i look like a plumber ?
you mind if we take a look ?
knock yourself out .
come on , you gotta put your back into it , spence .
where &apos;s morgan when you need him ?
look at this .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
the unsub doesn &apos;t have sex with his victims .
then why did he need the condom ?
well , it takes impotence off the table .
he clearly had intercourse with someone
after he committed the murder .
so , he doesn &apos;t rape her .
he has sex with someone else in the room .
a lover ?
who &apos;s also his partner in crime .
we &apos;re looking for a team .
c.o.d. &apos; s pretty straightforward .
they died of asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation .
leather fibers in the cuts
makes me think he used some sort of belt .
there &apos;s no defensive wounds .
her larynx was completely crushed .
hey , rossi , take a look at her fingernails .
for a woman who lives on the streets , she appears well @-@ groomed .
yeah , it was the same with both victims .
i &apos;d say they bathed shortly before the attacks occurred .
between this and the shower curtain ,
cleanliness is important to them .
that could be part of their ruse .
they promise shelter and a warm shower .
which would be a perfect opportunity
to carry out a sexual assault , but they don &apos;t .
instead , they allow their victims to get partially dressed
in their underwear before they kill them .
why ?
because it &apos;s not about sex with the victims .
it &apos;s about sex with each other .
but if we &apos;re dealing with two men who are sadists ,
they would leave the woman naked to humiliate her .
a female partner might not .
so then we &apos;re looking at a male and a female
who are most likely in some sort of romantic relationship .
and they &apos;re using murder as their foreplay .
you married ?
actually divorced .
why ?
i just find it amusing we &apos;re paying you for advice
on something you failed .
well , there &apos;s a lesson in everything .
my marriage taught me patience and understanding ,
which i try to pass on to my clients .
is that what you tell yourself
when you go home to an empty bed at night ?
sorry i &apos;m late .
hey , sweetie .
oh , traffic was a nightmare .
no problem .
here &apos;s a question for you .
what &apos;s your favorite flower ?
uh ... pink roses .
and when was the last time he bought you some ?
oh , god , it &apos;s gotta be years ago .
when did i become the bad guy here ?
calm down .
no , she &apos;s clearly picking sides .
see , there &apos;s that temper again .
i &apos;m actually proposing that you take charge ,
starting with the pink roses .
think you can handle that ?
for years you &apos;ve been saying we don &apos;t dance enough .
come on .
if you were listening ,
you &apos;d know i was talking about the tango ,
not ballroom .
just tonight , for just one night ,
can we not do this ?
just give it a chance .
i knew you wanted to smile .
where did you learn how to do that ?
i &apos;m gonna show you .
i am a natural .
ohh , i love that cologne on you .
why can &apos;t it always be like this ?
i &apos;m starting to realize
that change doesn &apos;t have to be a bad thing .
are you serious ?
pretty . i &apos;m listening .
i &apos;m tired of following your script .
i want to take the lead tonight .
i &apos;ll pick a good one .
all right .
were you serious ?
sweetie ,
tonight , it &apos;s all about you , it &apos;s all about you .
* feel like makin &apos; love *
* i feel like makin &apos; love *
* i feel like makin &apos; love to you *
take a look at this .
you guys were right .
i was able to match their m.o. to 10 other strangulation murders .
we were only able to identify 4 .
they &apos;ve been at it since 1994 .
looks like they stopped in 2010
and remained dormant up until now .
something had to prevent them from killing .
maybe one was incarcerated .
i &apos;ll start pulling prison records ,
see if i can &apos;t get a match .
these two have been in a relationship
a lot longer than we thought .
but even if they broke up , to come back together
and resume killing after a 4 @-@ year hiatus is rare .
love is strange .
it &apos;ll make you do the craziest things .
guys ,
what if they &apos;re married ?
let me help you with your coat .
your wife mentioned you two
were looking to have a good time tonight .
ah , she did , did she ?
isn &apos;t he perfect , honey ?
hmm . sweetheart , like i said ,
tonight &apos;s all about you .
well , before we get started ,
you might want to clean up .
yeah , sure .
where &apos;s your husband ?
he stepped out for a sec .
i hope he doesn &apos;t mind us getting started without him .
actually , i do mind .
i told you i &apos;d pick a good one .
huh . this is a first for them .
aside from gender , the m.o. is the same .
something in their dynamic must have changed .
a male victim most likely caters
to the female unsub &apos;s desires .
they haven &apos;t displayed that behavior before .
up until now , it appears it &apos;s been the male picking the victims .
which typically indicates a dominant / submissive relationship .
it looks as though her psychopathology could be evolving .
ok , we need to look at this from a marriage perspective .
compromise is the key to any long @-@ term relationship &apos;s success .
what if this murder was their way of sharing responsibility ?
he let the woman choose the victim . that could be problematic .
now that she &apos;s been given control ,
she might not want to let it go .
dancing .
i &apos;m impressed .
how did all that romance make you feel ?
spoiled .
the roses .
the dancing .
he gave up a lot to make last night very special .
yeah , i guess i &apos;m starting to realize
that it can &apos;t always be about me .
compromise is important .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re starting to understand that .
i gotta say , you both are making great progress .
i think i speak for both of us when i say
we &apos;d love to make this part of our regular routine again .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a married couple ,
to whom we can attribute at least 13 deaths since 1994 .
he &apos;s a sexual sadist , and she &apos;s a scopophiliac ,
which is greek for &quot; love of looking , &quot;
meaning that she gets off on watching her husband kill .
like karla homolka and paul bernardo ,
who raped , tortured and killed at least 19 people ,
this couple &apos;s homicidal tendencies
most likely surfaced once they met .
it &apos;s possible
that the use of a shower curtain is a sign of remorse
on the part of the female unsub .
up until now , all the victims were females ,
so it &apos;s possible that the change in victimology
could be the husband &apos;s way of subjugating his own needs
for his wife &apos;s happiness .
but a sexual sadist doesn &apos;t typically subjugate .
we think he could have committed crimes on the side
that have gotten him arrested .
but wouldn &apos;t we have the bodies to prove that ?
yes . which is why we need to take another look
at all strangulations within the geographical profile
that occurred during the gap years .
without his female partner &apos;s influence ,
the male &apos;s independent m.o. should present differently .
learning the nature of how that differs
from their team dynamic
will be the key to driving a wedge between their partnership .
in the meantime , all transients are at risk .
now that the wife has gotten a taste of control ,
she &apos;ll crave that feeling again .
yeah !
and if the husband sublimated his needs with the last kill ,
his desire to fulfill his own will be what &apos;s driving him now .
thank you very much .
sweetheart !
i &apos;m home .
you &apos;re late .
ah . i had a few errands to run .
it took a little longer than expected .
you couldn &apos;t bother to call ?
no , i couldn &apos;t , because
it would have ruined the surprise .
all that overtime--
it finally paid off .
ok , turn around .
the minute i saw it ,
i knew you had to have it .
you like it ?
good .
well , that &apos;s what i was thinking , paul .
it was 2010 the last time this happened .
boy , he just came out of nowhere this time .
i mean , he was way behind ,
and somehow he was able to pull it right off .
he &apos;s the guy that can do this--
well , honey , i got a job .
but we &apos;re supposed to be going to the movies .
the movie starts in an hour .
i &apos;ll be back in 30 minutes .
please be on time . i don &apos;t want to miss the previews .
sweetie , we won &apos;t . i promise .
i have a 1989 strangulation victim
dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found ,
only she was raped and stabbed .
his comfort zone . could be our unsub .
well , i &apos;ve got two more , &apos; 01 and &apos; 03,
except these took place in clifford , delaware .
the m.o. &apos; s an exact match .
i got another one here from 2013,
scottsdale , maryland .
he was smart enough to cross state lines .
the crestview rapist was operating during that time .
the male unsub never went dormant .
only the female did .
so when this guy kills without his wife ,
his signature changes to stabbing
and sexual assault .
well , stabbing is indicative of rage ,
and it &apos;s most likely towards women .
and the sexual assault is his way
of establishing dominance over them .
maybe their marriage isn &apos;t as solid as we think .
clearly he has issues that he &apos;s working out
when the wife isn &apos;t around .
well , if she emasculates her husband at home ,
that could be the reason why she now needs
to have control over the murders .
hey , guys , we have a survivor .
hannah franklin , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old waitress
who was attacked on her way home from work back in 2008 .
how long is this gonna take ?
i &apos;m already late for work .
i know this is something you &apos;d like to forget .
you &apos;re damn right .
i still have nightmares .
that guy left me for dead .
why would i want to relive that night ?
because if you do , you can stop that night
from happening to someone else .
it &apos;s not my problem .
ok .
unless that next victim &apos;s your daughter .
because it will be someone &apos;s daughter , i promise you .
it was ... dark .
i was on my way home from work .
and i had just cut through a parking lot ...
it &apos;s ok .
take your time .
i was looking down at my phone .
and that &apos;s when he pulled me into the alley .
ok , look at me .
look at me .
i need you to tell me what the alley smelled like .
i don &apos;t know . all i can smell is his cologne .
ok , then focus on that
and let it guide you to the periphery .
oh , no ...
what do you see in the alley ?
uh , there &apos;s a dumpster .
ok , keep going . keep going .
no , i can &apos;t . he &apos;s-- he &apos;s on top of me .
hannah , you &apos;re in a safe place . ok ?
i &apos;m right here with you .
no--
what else do you see ?
there &apos;s a couple on the other side of the fence .
they &apos;re getting into their car .
i &apos;m trying to scream for help ,
but his hand is covering--
can you make out the type of car ?
no .
why not ?
there &apos;s something in the way .
what ?
the--the hook .
a hook ? what kind of hook ?
a fishing hook ? an ice hook ?
no , larger than that . it &apos;s attached to something big .
like a vehicle ?
there &apos;s a large metal arm .
it &apos;s a--wait , it &apos;s a tow truck .
ok , great .
can you make out any identifying marks ?
color ? license plate number ?
uh , tan , maybe white . i &apos;m not sure .
ok , now focus on him .
no ...
what is he wearing ?
some sort of work uniform .
it &apos;s greasy .
ok , now , hannah-- hannah , this is important .
does he have on a name patch ?
oh , god , it &apos;s about to happen !
the patch . look at the patch , ok ?
no ! no !
alan .
his name was alan .
ok .
thank you .
it &apos;s alan . leave a message . thanks .
hi , it &apos;s me again . where are you ?
i &apos;ve left you 3 messages .
ok , i &apos;m heading out the door .
bye .
judith anderson ! fbi !
show us your hands !
drop it !
tell me what &apos;s going on . somebody , please .
what &apos;s happening ?
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
she hasn &apos;t even said a word .
hasn &apos;t even asked where her husband is .
because she knows the answer .
she &apos;s hiding something .
dna results .
the condom found in the hotel room .
you &apos;re gonna want to take a look at that .
hi , judith . my name &apos;s alex .
can i get you anything to drink ?
i &apos;d like to make a phone call .
to who ?
your husband ?
you &apos;re coming up on your 20th anniversary .
congratulations .
that is a huge accomplishment .
we recovered a used condom with alan &apos;s dna in it .
nothing odd about that ,
except you &apos;ve had a hysterectomy .
so , why use condoms if you can &apos;t conceive ?
you seem to know a lot .
you tell me .
well , you just don &apos;t strike me as the unfaithful type .
i mean , alan , on the other hand , he &apos;s a different story .
you know nothing about my husband .
well , actually , i know a lot .
i know your husband tested positive
for an std back in 2010 .
you two were married in 1994,
which tells me he isn &apos;t as committed to your marriage as you think .
there was a point in time when both of us
were unfaithful in our marriage .
when i found out he had cheated--
you thought if you retaliated it would make you feel better .
my husband and i no longer keep secrets .
i &apos;ve know he &apos;s had an std for years .
the reason we use condoms , to answer your question ,
is because he insists on protecting me .
that &apos;s how much he loves me .
so she &apos;s aware of alan &apos;s indiscretions .
he contracted the std in 2010 .
that &apos;s around the same time they went dormant .
the first body was found in 1989 .
but judith and alan weren &apos;t married until &apos; 94 .
which means alan was doing this on his own
5 years before they met .
and once they were married ,
there was no conflict until he cheated on her .
that &apos;s probably when judith decided she no longer
wanted to participate in the murders .
she took away what he enjoyed doing most .
so she &apos;s probably not aware
that he continued to kill without her .

hi , it &apos;s me again . where are you ?
i &apos;ve left you 3 messages .
ok , i &apos;m heading out the door .
bye .
judith anderson ! fbi !
show us your hands !
drop it !
tell me what &apos;s going on . somebody , please .
what &apos;s happening ?
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be held against you
in a court of law .
i can &apos;t wait to see where this is headed .
when you discovered your husband was cheating ,
you took away the one thing
that mattered most to him .
his partner in crime .
now , how do you think he dealt with that ?
do you recognize any of these women ?
how many times are we gonna go through this ?
no , i do not .
and these are only a few of the victims
that he raped and murdered without you .
and which one do you think gave him the std ?
just take a look for yourself .
his dna is all over each of these women .
it &apos;s the killing without you that &apos;s most painful .
it &apos;s the cheating that you can &apos;t forgive .
you &apos;re married . where &apos;s your husband ?
at home .
hmm . and you &apos;re here .
what would happen if he were to slip up ?
how would you know ?
a wife knows .
which is why you know i &apos;m telling you the truth .
my husband and i aren &apos;t perfect .
look at these women . look at the way
he treated them .
we &apos;re rebuilding
step by step ,
he hates them
brick by brick .
because he hates you .
he loves me !
i want to talk to a lawyer .
i &apos;ve gotta hand it to her . judith &apos;s not budging .
she &apos;s committed to protecting her husband .
and their marriage .
&quot; we &apos;re rebuilding step by step &quot; ?
interesting choice of words .
oh , i &apos;ve heard those many times before .
marriage counseling .
that would explain how they were able
to move through alan &apos;s infidelity .
they were seeing a therapist .
maybe they still are .
green means go .
garcia , can you check and see
if judith and alan have a therapist ?
checking now ...
uh , ok . looks like they sought help
from a bunch of different people ,
but for the past couple of months , anyway ,
they &apos;ve been seeing a kathleen benedict
several times a week .
says here she specializes in something called insight therapy .
insight therapy is also known as psychodynamic therapy .
it helps patients rediscover what motivates them
in an effort to resolve old conflicts .
and if the conflict stems from their marriage ,
then helping judith and alan rediscover what motivates them
would reignite their compulsion to kill .
therapy was most likely judith &apos;s idea .
alan doesn &apos;t seem like the type
to take guidance from a woman .
maybe the emasculation we profiled didn &apos;t come from judith .
maybe it came from the therapist .
dr. benedict ! dr. benedict !
listen , sorry to call you at the last minute .
no , it &apos;s fine . uh , what &apos;s going on ?
your message sounded urgent .
oh . well , judith and i , we might be going away for a while ,
so i just wanted to have one more session ,
get a few things off my chest .
i &apos;m impressed .
i know how hard therapy has been for you .
this is definitely a step in the right direction .
yeah .
you do something different with your hair ?
no .
it looks nice .
here , let me get that for you .
is judith here yet ?
uh , no . she &apos;s not coming .
just you and me .
that was hotch . no sign of alan at the house .
he &apos;s probably aware that we have judith in custody .
if that &apos;s the case , he knows
it &apos;s only a matter of time before we get to him .
at this point , the guy &apos;s got nothing to lose ,
which makes him more dangerous than ever .
so where is everyone ?
oh , they all took off for the long weekend .
you didn &apos;t have any plans ?
figured i &apos;d use this time to catch up on work .
well , i guess it &apos;s just me and you , then , huh ?
excuse me . it &apos;s my personal line .
sure .
this is kathleen .
kathleen , my name is spencer reid .
i &apos;m a federal agent .
right now you need to stay calm and not react .
ok .
is alan anderson there with you ? answer yes or no .
yes , that &apos;s correct .
you need to understand that alan is a dangerous man
and he &apos;s wanted for several murders .
ok . i understand .
how can i help ?
do you think you can get away from there without alerting him ?
not at this time .
i &apos;m completely booked .
hello ?
do you think he knows ?
i think you should step on the gas .
that &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned in the 20 years i &apos;ve been married ,
is to listen to how a woman speaks on the phone .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you nervous ?
alan , you &apos;re not being rational right now .
we can talk about whatever &apos;s on your mind .
or i can just show you .
no ! aah !
somebody ...
somebody , please , please , somebody , please --
somebody , please !
you don &apos;t know how long i &apos;ve been waiting for this !
alan , don &apos;t do this --
shh ! shh ! try my process .
alan anderson , fbi !
don &apos;t !
it &apos;s ok . hey , you &apos;re ok .
we found alan .
where is he ? is he ok ?
he &apos;s fine , and so is dr. benedict ,
who he attempted to rape and kill .
judith , your husband is going away for a long time ,
but you don &apos;t have to .
if you cooperate , i will move to get your sentence reduced .
this is the last time i &apos;m going to say this .
i will never betray him
or my marriage again .
you might want to reconsider that .
he certainly betrays you every chance he gets .
this is gloria walters , and the necklace she &apos;s wearing
was given to her by her fiance .
she was raped and murdered last night by your husband ,
who we &apos;ve also identified as the crestview rapist .
can i see him ?
sweetheart .
you son of a bitch !
you &apos;re a liar . i hate you !
get him out .
i am so sorry .
i totally could have made that recipe without cilantro .
it &apos;s my fault . i should have disclosed my food allergies .
but i could have asked .
take a breath . the swelling &apos;s gone down .
now what are we gonna do for our first valentine &apos;s ?
whatever you want to do .
i don &apos;t want it to always be up to me .
i thought you liked planning things .
yeah . but if i &apos;m always the one planning things ,
then i &apos;m always the one planning things .
you &apos;re right .
so i &apos;m gonna make the executive decision
that we are spending our first valentine &apos;s day
at patty &apos;s .
patty &apos;s , the diner ?
yeah , patty &apos;s the diner .
they have the best milkshakes in town .
come on .
i like milkshakes .
you , come here .
come here .
you know , that &apos;s why i blame you .
what , me ?
yes . one more time turns into two more times ,
and now there &apos;s no way
we &apos;re getting a table on such short notice .
girl , look at you . can you blame me ?
but as long as i &apos;m with you ,
we can go anywhere you want .
oh , wait a minute .
hello . what are you doing here ?
oh , my god .
penelope ?
wow , it is so nice to finally meet you .
you , too .
hey , you must be sam .
sam i am .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
oh . not guilty . not guilty .
look at you guys . you &apos;re literally flawless .
you &apos;re the live @-@ action ken and barbie .
so where are you guys headed ?
uh , well , we actually had a change of plans .
same here .
is what &apos;s happening right now
what i think is happening right now ?
why , i believe so .
this is our first double date .

and after you , sir .
&quot; each relationship nurtures a strength or weakness within you . &quot;
