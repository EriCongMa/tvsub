第三季 第十一集
so , obviously , nick has told you about how i &apos;ve been volunteering
at the children &apos;s museum ,
and really hitting it off with the head curator , candace , right ?
in my way , i have .
i &apos;ve never heard that .
hasn &apos;t said a word . thank god .
come on .
guys , give me one second .
i gotta go play a round of &quot; car keys monty &quot;
with kevin @-@ 97 or he &apos;ll try to drive home .
so , anyway , about a month ago ,
candace calls me and tells me
there might be a full @-@ time fund @-@ raising position opening up
and i &apos;d be perfect for it .
there we go ,
look for the keys , look for the keys , look for the keys .
and she keeps pushing me for an answer ,
and i keep putting her off .
i say , &quot; thank you very much . i &apos;m very flattered ,
but i already have a job . me teacher . &quot;
that &apos;s a grammar joke . you get it .
look at the jukebox for a sec .
when i think of teachers , i think of two things : jessica day
and pornography where the characters are teachers .
well , of course i &apos;ve always wanted to be a teacher ,
but my school &apos;s a disaster .
justice brandeis believed that ...
ms. day ?
education &apos;s principal foster , everybody !
thank you so much .
ms. day , we have hit a construction hiccup
in our renovation , so ...
okay .
everybody &apos;s gonna have to be sharing
classroom space .
what ?
hey , do you have a freezer or should i flush these frogs ?
my check comes either way .
oh , come on . foster &apos;s sticking us with the math kids
that use letters instead of numbers ?
do you mean algebra ?
i guess .
anyway , it &apos;s gonna be a couple of crazy months , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry ? months ?
right . years if the bond issue fails .
which it might ,
since voters are trending anti @-@ future .
anti @-@ future ? who &apos;s anti @-@ future ?
i don &apos;t know . the amish ?
the dying ?
television industry , print media ,
record industry , railroad industry ,
karaoke machine owners . you got this ?
i &apos;m gonna go not smoke pot .
so my phone rings ...
oh , we telling phone stories ?
nice .
no , i &apos;m talking about work .
so your phone rings .
and it &apos;s candace officially offering me the job !
and i told her i &apos;d think about it !
wow , you not being a school teacher ?
well , you have found my flabbergast button ,
and guess what , you &apos;ve pressed it .
i &apos;m flabbergasted as hell , too .
look , i &apos;ve been a teacher my entire life ,
and i &apos;ve always wanted to be a teacher ,
but maybe i should be doing something else . i don &apos;t know .
how do you know when you &apos;re on the right path ?
it &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s crazy .
that wasn &apos;t a rhetorical question .
what i like to do is just take a drive up there pch maybe .
willy wonka once said ...
guys , candace is calling at 6 : 00 to find out my final answer !
what ?
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re in such a pickle .
but i &apos;m not sorry that i get to time something !
19 minutes , people !
all right .
just to be clear , 19 minutes until 6 : 00 .
i &apos;m not sure this is helping .
this brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation .
yeah , because you &apos;re being timed now .
this is a life @-@ changing decision , that &apos;s it .
you time a lot of stuff , coach .
46 seconds .
17 minutes till 6 : 00 . 17 minutes , jess .
coach , do you always wear a stopwatch ? like always ?
you familiar with rollergirl &apos;s relationship
to her skates in boogie nights ?
yes .
well , i &apos;m not ,
because i don &apos;t watch movies , i time them .
they &apos;re pornographers , but they &apos;re also a family .
1 : 45 : 30 official running time , my round ass !
jess , choosing a career path is never easy ,
but what i found ...
oh , my god .
shut up , dude !
come on .
she &apos;s looking for career advice .
your job could be done by a vending machine .
guys , don &apos;t be mean .
so nick doesn &apos;t have a traditional career . i mean ...
or is it the most traditional ?
maybe i &apos;m thinking about prostitution .
guys , as you all know , i am the expert
at changing career paths .
is this something we &apos;re now bragging about ?
no , schmidt , i &apos;m referring to my decision
to quit playing the game of basketball .
jess , i will tell you this , it was not easy .
it all began back ...
come on , winston . move it along .
okay , jess , fine ,
but don &apos;t blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies
of this crazy english muffin we call winston &apos;s life .
i was the ninth guy off the bench
for the eighth @-@ best team in latvia .
winnie the bish ! winnie the bish !
winnie the bish !
ha @-@ ha ! thanks for coming to watch me play , guys .
we didn &apos;t watch you play . we watched you sit .
which was still fun .
you know , any chance to get to latvia , right , guys ?
yeah , i haven &apos;t played all year .
they barely let me practice , but you know ,
like i always say , how about them lats ?
so that &apos;s when you decided to change course .
that makes sense . so my takeaway from that is ...
still building to the decision .
you are traded to kraslava city .
the outdoor league ?
man , they play on a hillside !
i give you surprise tip : uphill basket , better .
aha , and then you decided ...
i &apos;m going fast !
you never play basketball again .
don &apos;t touch it . stop it .
and that &apos;s when i decided
to stop playing the game of basketball .
jess , walk away the moment you stop loving it .
i mean , that &apos;s what i did .
that &apos;s the thing , you didn &apos;t walk away .
you decided nothing . that story contains zero decisions .
look , i decided to stop playing the game of basketball
when my doctor told me i had to stop .
okay , okay , all right , i ... it was my decision ...
... to start to play the game of basket ...
you were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born .
damn , do i even like basketball ?
i mean , goodness ,
have i ever made any decisions my whole life ?
are we all just living inside the mind of a giant ?
all right , good job , buddy . really good . thanks .
you know , if i may be so bold ...
oh , please . winston , have a seat .
i was literally about to give advice .
she already heard one cautionary tale tonight ,
she does not need to hear another .
what she needs to hear is my story .
a story of hard choices . a story of paths taken .
a story that i like to call , &quot; kablamo mcyeah , bro ! &quot;
ah , you stupid ...
the title has nothing to do with the story , but you need a hook .
it all began back ...
come on , schmidt !
what ? only one story
in the whole wide world can begin in a hospital ?
i volunteered a lot in college .
but i shone brightest as a candy striper .
sick people wanted me .
dying people wanted to be me .
i was the total candy @-@ striping package .
and yet i remained invisible
to the one whose gaze i desired the most .
invisible ?
you were like a 300 @-@ pound wall of peppermint bark .
her badge said &quot; rn &quot; for registered nurse ,
but as far as i was concerned , it said &quot; nilth , &quot;
&quot; nurse i &apos;d like to hug . &quot;
not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form .
where &apos;s a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that , huh ?
i don &apos;t volunteer .
i &apos;m a man .
i have a job in marketing .
obviously i was far too fat to work in marketing .
so i got a job any dumb slob could do .
relax , man , it &apos;s your first day .
for a jewish giant ,
i had a surprising knack for selling christmas trees .
not only did my wide center of gravity
make me freakishly strong ,
but i could also sell like the wind .
because i understood one fundamental truth .
when you &apos;re buying christmas trees ...
you &apos;re really buying sex .
have you always been short ?
i &apos;ve always been fat .
but who cares how god made you ?
don &apos;t let him put you in a skin box .
at the end of the day , i &apos;m just a fat guy
standing here in front of a short guy telling him
that i think we found his tree .
it wasn &apos;t long before i caught the attention of old man mccue ,
christmas tree king of syracuse ,
inventor of triple netting .
however ...
in the words of the late , great sir billy joel ...
billy joel is definitely alive .
and he &apos;s definitely not a knight .
&quot; the good , they do die young . &quot;
when you &apos;re on your deathbed ,
when your life has been lived ,
you &apos;re never gonna say ,
&quot; i wish i &apos;d spent more time with my family . &quot;
because money
and everything it buys ,
you can ...
take it
with you ...
interesting , money .
actually the museum job pays more than the teaching job .
wait , the m ...
then what the hell are we talking about here , you guys ?
done deal , case closed .
follow them ducats .
it &apos;s not always about the money , schmidt .
guys , look , it &apos;s almost 6 : 00 .
and candace is insanely punctual .
you know , one of the best
career choices of the future--
driveways .
you &apos;re welcome .
jess , the museum job pays more .
all right ...
the decision has been made for you .
no , no , no .
you do know the difference between more and less .
don &apos;t you ?
yes , schmidt .
all of my decisions &apos; have been made for me .
i &apos;m only in sports radio because
i played professional basketball .
i played professional basketball
because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby .
what if somebody gave baby winston a flower ?
then what would i be ?
beekeeper !
hummingbird farmer .
oh , does water shoot out of the flower ?
if so , you &apos;d be a hilarious comedian .
wait , guys , this is classic after @-@ 6 : 00 topics .
look , i ... there has to be more to this than money .
i really want to care about what i do .
don &apos;t you ever miss getting your hands dirty and selling ?
i &apos;ve moved up in the world .
i &apos;m not freezing and covered in sap .
i &apos;m making spreadsheets .
it &apos;s like old man mccue used to say-
the reward is in the destination .
it &apos;s not in the journey .
was he wise or was he senile ?
because he &apos;s mixed up a lot of really well @-@ known sayings .
jess , you &apos;re gonna want to listen to me .
anyone else here named after their career ?
people call you markety ?
not yet .
that &apos;s too bad &apos; cause that &apos;s awesome .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
hands up , ulvis !
ball screen , vlad , come on !
there we go , yes !
bishop , finger out of your nose , now !
ernie &apos;s a really good coach .
maybe we should call him coach .
we should probably call him ...
you do it first .
uh ... coach .
that &apos;s a great name ! high five !
yeah !
i think you see what i mean .
no , i do ... i really don &apos;t .
my point is
don &apos;t overthink it , jess .
the call &apos;s coming from inside the house .
what ?
be who you are .
and do what you do .
what if i don &apos;t know who i am ?
and you know , i &apos;m capable of doing
a lot of different things .
then you are on your own .
good stuff , coach .
jess , would it help to think
about your first day as a teacher ?
like , i think about the first time i ever poured a drink ...
boo , get off the stage !
aw , man .
nick !
dude , stop .
no , that &apos;s interesting .
the first day i ever taught .
portland country day .
five @-@ team pacific northwest squash champions .
go , rhododendrons !
now , if i was chalk , where would i be ?
if i were chalk , where would i be ?
slip up like that in front of the kids , day ,
and they &apos;ll eat you alive .
eddie pascucci kicked my ass because i &apos;m new .
well , guess what ?
i &apos;m new , too .
i got lost trying to find the upper dining garden .
oh , that &apos;s over by the hedge maze and the stables .
i haven &apos;t even met my horse yet .
come on , let &apos;s get you cleaned up .
all of these jackets have cash in the pockets .
it &apos;s like a $ 50,000 lost and found .
here , try this one .
yup .
you look great , clifton .
this doesn &apos;t fit !
eddie pascucci beats up the unstylish !
yeah , that &apos;s right .
we had an ethnic , gay bully .
he &apos;s gonna have to come through me first .
clifton collins really just needed
someone to believe in him .
so i started tutoring him in math ,
and he became the best math student in school .
so , let &apos;s look him up and see
how happy and successful and amazing he &apos;s doing .
yeah !
because i think that &apos;ll really fire you up .
all right , there &apos;s no trace of him .
what ?
i &apos;m really , i &apos;m really good at this .
just ... i &apos;m good at it , let me see .
you found him . he &apos;s right here .
no , i didn &apos;t .
here &apos;s clifton , wow .
it &apos;s not a ...
yeah , he &apos;s right there .
that &apos;s clifton . oh , yeah .
we &apos;re not the only ones looking for him .
so &apos;s the fbi .
what ?
yeah , he &apos;s a criminal .
no .
oh , my god .
clifton &quot; baby madoff &quot; collins ?
wanted for 53 ...
... counts of embezzlement .
sounds like the math took .
screw me .
like , i ...
maybe i wasn &apos;t even reaching the kids at all .
okay , you know what ?
miller up .
excuse me ?
that &apos;s just like &quot; fill &apos; er up , &quot; but with &quot; miller . &quot;
don &apos;t .
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to fill you up ,
no , that &apos;s gross .
with my stories .
oh , please don &apos;t .
that &apos;s disgusting .
what &apos;s disgusting about it ?
my first year of law school ,
i made an important discovery .
look left . look right .
next year , one of you will be gone .
what a cliche ? huh ?
明年 你们中就会有一人离开
oh , you wrote that down .
you &apos;ll be gone . i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m gonna be fine . i &apos;m gonna be right here .
take it easy , guy to my right .
i discovered that i hated
being around these people .
but second year , i made another discovery .
i hated being around myself .
so my third year ,
i wanted to find a place where i belonged .
where i could look to my left
or look to my right and like what i saw .
love you in that scarf .
why don &apos;t you wear scarves anymore ?
that place ?
perhaps you guessed it :
this very bar .
get out of town .
what a twist .
how long has that guy been there ?
kevin @-@ 97 ?
since 1997 , jess .
why else do you think we would call him ...
i don &apos;t know . move it along , miller .
true , i wasn &apos;t loving law school ,
but my grades were fine and i even signed up
for the california state bar .
and then , one day ...
red over @-@ served himself
and everything changed .
so you went behind the bar ,
quit law school , you became a bartender ...
there &apos;s more to it than that .
two minutes !
oh , my god . i honestly don &apos;t know what to do .
i have so little time .
cece !
have you ever questioned your entire career ?
duh , i &apos;m a 31 @-@ year @-@ old model .
my last job was for a phone sex ad ,
and i was the one calling .
tell me what to do .
and don &apos;t tell me to ask the guys , because i already tried that .
and also , don &apos;t tell me
to think about my first student , clifton .
okay , no , wait .
your first student was not clifton .
lady , she &apos;s still got one minute .
that was a butt dial from your mother .
she is up to no good .
cece , we &apos;re fast .
you got 53 seconds .
you okay ?
yes .
no .
i think i need glasses ,
unless crying makes your eyes not work .
i can &apos;t read this ,
but even when i can , i don &apos;t understand it .
crying makes your eyes work better .
after i finished sophie &apos;s choice ,
i could see in the dark for a week .
here &apos;s what i do when i lose mine .
ooh , this is interesting .
get in here .
we &apos;ll learn it together .
but everyone &apos;ll laugh at us .
they can drive it or milk it
as far as i &apos;m concerned .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
i heard my dad say it .
my dad just died .
well , if you want to come over and listen to mine say ,
&quot; they can drive it or milk it ... &quot;
you can .
he &apos;s also got one about the turds at city hall .
thanks .
i &apos;m cece .
jess .
i was your first student .
hey , candace .
um , yeah .
actually ...
i &apos;m not gonna take the job .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you sunday .
okay . bye .
all right ! yeah !
thanks , guys .
yes !
thanks , guys .
you did it .
good stuff .
hey . she did it .
you made the right call , jess . what &apos;s wrong ?
i think you &apos;re right .
i made the right decision .
look , i know it &apos;s hard ...
but the hard is what ...
makes it good .
um ... is that from
a league of their own ?
a league of their own .
yes , of course . all my quotes are from sports movies .
you guys don &apos;t know them and so they seem original .
a league of their own is not a sports movie .
a sport movie , first and foremost .
it &apos;s about sisterhood .
and the war .
yeah , absolutely .
it &apos;s about a baseball team grinding it up .
* this used to be my playground ...
coming right up .
his sister really worries about
his drinking , so what i do is i come in early
and i soak a teabag until the water turns brown
and looks like booze .
i call it tea @-@ water .
so ... tea .
i will take a big old glass of booze @-@ water .
got an antacid commercial tomorrow
and i &apos;m playing day @-@ old curry .
or you can bartend .
you can bartend till you &apos;re 90 years old .
why don &apos;t you fire this down to kevin @-@ 97 ?
oh , no .
we &apos;re gonna work on that .
good morning , everybody .
welcome to alge @-@ bio @-@ civics .
turn in your equations ,
and you will get a frog .
dissect carefully ,
because inside the frog
is the name of the city council member
who you will be e @-@ mailing
to restart construction .
ms. day ?
yes .
i thought this was gonna be a disaster .
but thanks to you ,
i can go upstairs to the big boys
and tell them they can always depend ...
on dr. alan foster .
yeah .
please take his job ,
i &apos;m begging you .
i &apos;d do it myself ,
but i &apos;d never pass the psych test .
so i figure ...
if foster can be a principal ,
then why can &apos;t i be a principal ?
that &apos;s great .
i don &apos;t see why not .
that &apos;s awesome .
thank you . then you could take me
to the principal &apos;s office and punish me for being tardy .
you know we &apos;re right here , right ?
just lift up my britches and ...
we &apos;ll talk about it later .
okay .
very nice .
we &apos;ll do it in my office .
after i fill up my juice box .
so , guys , just quit my job today .
whoa , big decision .
oh , man !
what ?
i just finally said to myself ,
&quot; it is time to make your own decisions . &quot;
right on .
yeah .
if it doesn &apos;t work out , i &apos;m sure they &apos;d
be happy to have you back .
they would ... they would not like to have me back .
i burned a lot of bridges today .
uh , stuff got weird . stuff got ... racial .
what ?
i used a lot of swearwords .
then i got sexual ...
well , sounds like you need a drink . on the house .
what can i get you ?
ooh ... let me get a , let me get a ...
we have everything . what would you like to drink ?
but you know , i &apos;ll make the decision .
let me get ...
double amaretto , extra cherries ! double amaretto ,
extra cherries ! that &apos;s what i was gonna say .
nice .
oh , dear .
oh , my goodness !
my first shift , you know ? i &apos;m still working on it .
she &apos;s getting better .
that was great .
that was awesome .
yeah . a natural .
sorry i didn &apos;t let you finish your story .
what &apos;s this ?
the end of my story .
no way !
you passed the bar exam ?
i wanted to prove to myself
that i dropped out of law school
because i wanted to be a bartender ,
not because i couldn &apos;t be a lawyer .
this also says &quot; spaghetti sandwich . &quot;
that &apos;s just &apos; cause
it &apos;s a great idea . when i have a great idea , i write it down .
the point is ...
is i want this .
you know , it makes me happy .
well , here .
now , can i get you a drink ?
sure .
sure .
cheers . to unemployment .
absolutely .
exactly .
i see you &apos;re looking at a douglas fir .
it &apos;s a beautiful tree .
we move a ton of these dougie firs . love them .
but ...
i feel like you &apos;re ready for the spruce lifestyle .
let &apos;s spruce this up .
let me put you in a spruce today .
what kind of ceilings you got at home ? vaulted ? cathedral ?
by the way , there &apos;s no wrong answer .
you look like a confident man , you know that ?
you deserve a confident tree ...
