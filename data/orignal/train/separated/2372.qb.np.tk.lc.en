mrs. lockwood .
leaving so soon ?
i &apos;ve gotten myself into a vampire situation .
hello !
daddy ?
where &apos;s stefan ?
he gave himself over to klaus .
you can embrace what you truly are .
a ripper .
stefan can be saved . i &apos;ll help you bring him back .
so is this your master plan ?
build an army of hybrid slaves ?
no not slaves . soldiers .
something &apos;s wrong . they &apos;re all dead .
i should be able to turn them .
i killed the doppelganger .
i did everything i was told !
you &apos;re interrupting my drink .
you miss me ?
katherine . where are you ?
lurking outside your window , pining away .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m homesick . what have i missed ?
well , stefan &apos;s still klaus &apos; little prisoner
and elena still thinks she can save him
and no one &apos;s thought about you since you left .
and what about you ?
i &apos;m sure now that you &apos;ve given up on your brother ,
you &apos;re plotting some sort of way of moving in on his girlfriend .
i didn &apos;t give up on him .
i just don &apos;t know where he is .
but you do .
are you trailing them ?
a hybrid who wants me dead
and his sidekick who &apos;s off the rails ?
i couldn &apos;t be further away .
which means you know exactly where they are .
all i know is that klaus pitched a fit
once his hybrids didn &apos;t work .
now he &apos;s looking for some answers .
how do you know that ?
spend 500 years running ,
and there will be a few people along the way
that are looking out for you .
is that what you &apos;re doing ?
looking out for my brother ?
maybe , maybe not .
i &apos;m conflicted .
where are they ?
welcome back to chicago , stefan .
what are we doing here ?
i know how much you loved it here .
bringing back memories of the good old ripper days .
blocked out most of them .
a lot of blood , a lot of partying .
the details are all a blur .
well , that is a crying shame .
the details are what makes it legend .
word was the ripper of monterrey got lonely ,
so he escaped to the city for comfort .
it was prohibition .
everything was off limits then ,
which made everything so much fun .
guess who my eyes have just spied , ladies ?
looking for a good time , mr. salvatore ?
save me a dance , gloria .
please , help yourself .
oh , i always do .
careful , mr. salvatore .
you &apos;re still wearing your date .
she &apos;s lovely .
who are you ?
chicago was magical .
yeah , well , i &apos;ll take your word for it .
like i said , i don &apos;t remember most of it .
ready to get down to business , then ?
why am i still with you ?
we had our fun , your hybrids failed .
i mean , don &apos;t you want to move on ?
we &apos;re going to see my favorite witch .
if anyone can help us with our hybrid problem ,
it &apos;s her .
rise and shine , sleepy head .
what are you doing ? !
get out !
you know you were dreaming about me .
explains the drool .
oh , my god .
6 : 00 a.m .. seriously ?
do you really have nothing better to do at 6 : 00 a.m. ?
fine , don &apos;t come with me to bring stefan home .
see ya .
wait . wait , wait , wait . what ?
what are you talking about ? where is he ?
windy city .
he &apos;s in chicago ?
well , how do you know ?
it came to me in a dream .
i was naked . you would have loved it .
start packing .
is he ok ?
well , let &apos;s just say he &apos;s not there to meet oprah .
put these in the &quot; yes &quot; pile .
daddy , are you there ?
why won &apos;t you talk to me ?
dad !
i &apos;m so sorry this happened to you .
dad ...
i need an answer .
how do you walk in the sunlight ?
just let me go .
sweetheart , please , just answer me .
then we &apos;ll get on with it .
is that all you want to know ?
that &apos;s all i want to know .
interesting .
no , dad , no ! what are you--
what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
your ancestors built this place .
people figured it was for unruly prisoners at the jailhouse ,
but ...
they had something else in mind .
vervain in the ventilation system
to keep their subject weak .
reinforced steel containment chair ,
and that .
what ?
what are you doing ?
dad ?
blood controls you , sweetheart .
this is how i &apos;m going to fix you .
what ?
i sure hope we find him , &apos; cause it would suck
if the last momento of stefan
was that crappy old necklace .
it &apos;s an antique , damon ,
like you .
read this .
paints a pretty little picture
of stefan &apos;s first experience in chicago .
it &apos;s stefan &apos;s diary .
i &apos;m not going to invade his private thoughts .
you need to be prepared for what you &apos;re about to see .
i &apos;ve seen stefan in his darkest periods .
i can handle it .
here &apos;s one . march 12th , 1922 .
&quot; i &apos;ve blacked out days .
i wake up in strangers &apos; blood ,
in places i don &apos;t recognize with women i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
ahh ! i &apos;m shocked !
stefan &apos;s not a virgin ?
eyes on the road , grandma .
fine .
back to my game .
看见弗罗里达牌照的车后谁先说谁就赢
tell me if you see a florida plate .
sorry to crash the fun , boys ,
but some of us actually came here to hear the music .
not you .
i am so sorry , sweetheart .
are we offending you ?
it would take a lot more than a baby face
like this to offend me .
you ever going to tell me your name ?
sure , when you earn it .
now do gloria a favor and stick a sock in it .
looks familiar , doesn &apos;t it ?
i can &apos;t believe this place is still here .
you got to be kidding me .
so a hybrid walks into a bar , says to the bartender ...
stop . you may be invincible ,
but that doesn &apos;t make you funny .
i remember you .
yeah .
you &apos;re gloria .
shouldn &apos;t you be ...
old and dead ?
now if i die , who &apos;s going to run this place , huh ?
gloria &apos;s a very powerful witch .
i can slow the aging down some .
herbs and spells , but don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;ll catch up to me one day .
stefan , why don &apos;t you go and fix us up
a little something from behind the bar .
yeah , sure thing .
you look ravishing , by the way .
don &apos;t .
i know why you &apos;re here .
a hybrid out to make more hybrids ?
that kind of news travels .
so what am i doing wrong ? i broke the curse .
obviously you did something wrong .
look , every spell has a loophole ,
but a curse that old ...
we &apos;d have to contact the witch who created it .
well , that would be the original witch .
she &apos;s very dead .
i know .
and for me to contact her , i &apos;ll need help .
bring me rebekah .
rebekah .
rebekah is a bit preoccupied .
she has what i need . bring her to me .
what is this ?
well , i told you , stefan .
chicago &apos;s a magical place .
but this is me .
with you .
caroline ! it &apos;s mom .
just coming up for air after a few all @-@ nighters at the station .
i thought we &apos;d have lunch
and you could remind me
i promised not to work so hard .
no ! please ! stop !
please stop !
please !
i don &apos;t hurt anyone , i swear .
daddy , swear .
i can handle the urges . i can !
if you could handle it , this wouldn &apos;t happen .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
by conditioning you to associate vampirism with pain ,
in time , the thought of human blood
will make you repress your vampire instincts completely .
that &apos;s impossible .
daddy , you can &apos;t change who i am .
yes , i can .
no .
you remember this feeling .
no ... no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
stefan could live anywhere in chicago
and he chose this ?
there used to be an all @-@ girls high school around the corner ,
but it shut down for attendance issues .
weird .
if you &apos;re trying to scare me into giving up and going back ,
it &apos;s not going to work .
here we are .
stefan &apos;s second personality home .
pretty obvious he hasn &apos;t been here .
tour is not over yet .
stefan hid his alcohol .
what a monster .
look harder .
it &apos;s a list of names .
these are all of his victims ?
still handling it ?
what were you doing in the 1920s ?
paving the way for women &apos;s liberation ?
i was around . chicago &apos;s a big city .
stefan was a cocky ripper douche .
but i could avoid him and still
indulge in a few daisy buchanans of my own .
where are you going ?
his old stomping ground .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no . you stay here and whip up an actual plan .
i &apos;ll come back when i find him .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense . why don &apos;t i remember you ?
you said it yourself , that time had a lot of dark holes .
no , if you knew me ,
then why haven &apos;t you said anything ?
i &apos;m a little busy right now . memory lane will have to wait .
what the hell is going on ?
answer me .
let &apos;s just say we didn &apos;t get off to a brilliant start .
to be honest , i hated you .
it &apos;s beautiful .
a witch gave it to me .
supposedly it &apos;s magical .
and is it ?
it brought me love , didn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s late , rebekah , we &apos;re leaving .
get off of me !
who is this guy ?
stefan , don &apos;t . he &apos;ll kill you .
he &apos;s a lot stronger than he looks .
so this is the famous stefan salvatore
i &apos;ve been hearing so much about .
you &apos;re right , he does have funny hair .
i &apos;m bored . i want to go .
then go without me , i &apos;m not your girlfriend .
no , you &apos;re my sister ,
which means ... you have to do as i say .
your sister .
so i knew another original vampire .
if you can &apos;t handle it , then don &apos;t ask .
i don &apos;t recognize her .
well , don &apos;t tell her that .
rebekah &apos;s temper is worse than mine .
time to wake up , little sister .
any day now , rebekah .
she &apos;s being dramatic .
look , why don &apos;t you just tell me
what the hell is going on ?
i mean , you obviously want me here
for a reason , right ?
well , you have many useful talents .
do i ?
in fact , i learned some of my favorite tricks from you .
so stefan , enlighten me what makes you
worthy of an original like my sister ?
she &apos;s pure vampire
and you &apos;re no more than a diluted bloodline .
don &apos;t listen to him , stefan . nik &apos;s an elitist .
hmm . and where &apos;s the rest of your family ?
well , let &apos;s see . um , i killed most of them .
oh ! but not all .
and you &apos;re ok with that ?
well , we all had the chance to choose a side .
i chose the right one , eventually .
where the hell &apos;s my wife ?
i don &apos;t know . i give up .
you think you &apos;re so tough ?
hiding in your bar , drinking your liquor ?
a telephone call to chicago p.d. might set you straight .
lila ? lila , please come here for a second .
oh , thank god .
come on , we &apos;re leaving .
oh , no , no , no , no . no .
you &apos;re sitting .
stefan , don &apos;t be mean .
what the hell are you doing ?
thank you so much , lila .
why don &apos;t you go and bandage that up .
i &apos;d like you to join me for a drink .
what kind of sick freaks are you ?
i said , drink !
i didn &apos;t catch your name .
go to hell .
do you want another sip ?
liam .
liam grant .
liam grant !
have another sip , liam .
finish it .
i was your number one fan .
why should i believe any of this ?
when she wakes up ,
tell her to meet us at gloria &apos;s bar .
then volunteer your carotid artery and let her feed
until you die .
where are you going ?
you think i &apos;m lying , stefan .
you and i knew each other .
you trusted me with one of your secrets
and now i &apos;m going to prove it to you .
how ?
we &apos;re going to your old apartment .
all right .
well , look what the wind blew in .
last i heard , you hated this place .
gloria .
damn !
if i knew you were going to age like this ,
i would have stuck around .
i always did like you better .
but i see your brother is still running in the wrong crowd .
you &apos;ve seen him ?
with klaus . bad combo .
you know where they went ?
they &apos;ll be back here later tonight .
they &apos;re out running a little errand for me .
gloria ...
don &apos;t be a tease .
what kind of errand ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you may be cute , but you &apos;re still a vampire .
april , 1922 .
lexi found me last night , dragged me off the train tracks .
thinks she can make me care again .
june , 1924--lexi &apos;s driving me crazy .
more animal blood , more misery .
1935--cravings are there , but it &apos;s easier .
lexi &apos;s on to her next project--
getting me to laugh .
what a charming little homestead .
do you feel that ?
is anybody here ?
it &apos;s been vacant for decades .
people must break in all the time .
why &apos;d you bring me here ?
your friend , liam grant , the one who drank
his wife &apos;s blood-- i never could figure out
why you wanted his name .
and then you told me your little secret .
it was all part of your special little ritual .
to write it down .
and relive the kill ...
over and over again .
you believe me now ?
look what i found .
1918 .
single malt .
my favorite .
let &apos;s go and find someone to pair it with .
finally ! i called you an hour ago .
make yourself presentable .
i know where stefan &apos;s going to be tonight .
i told you that i was practically discovered by klaus
and you &apos;re worried about what i &apos;m wearing ?
i had an hour to realize
what a bad idea it was to leave you here alone ,
process it , and move on .
are you ok ?
ok , good .
get dressed . you &apos;re all road @-@ tripy and gross .
so you know where he &apos;s going to be ?
yes , with klaus .
so i &apos;ll distract klaus and you deal with stefan .
ok . thank you .
but you &apos;re going to have about five minutes tops
before that hybrid freak rips my heart out .
so please , tell me you can do this .
i can do this .
where &apos;s rebekah ?
she &apos;ll be here .
i can &apos;t just conjure her on demand .
what &apos;s with you ?
i thought chicago was your playground .
so this is why you asked me to be your wingman ?
because you liked the way
that i tortured innocent people ?
well , that &apos;s certainly half of it .
what &apos;s the other half ?
the other half , stefan ,
is that you used to want to be my wingman .
they &apos;re jealous .
your family wants you
dead because they can never be what you are .
what ? an abomination ?
no . a king .
look at us .
two sad orphans .
my sister fancies you , you know .
but ...
i should warn you ,
rebekah doesn &apos;t do anything half @-@ speed ,
and that includes falling in love .
so just be careful .
she &apos;s totally mad .
i appreciate the advice .
and when the point comes where
she inevitably leaves you--
she can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s just who she is .
don &apos;t let your heart do anything stupid .
you know what , you &apos;re a good friend , nik .
i &apos;m glad i met you .
to friendship .
i want you to know ,
when carol lockwood called and told me about you ...
i sat down and cried .
dad , i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;ve learned to adapt .
i don &apos;t need to be fixed .
i can &apos;t be fixed .
i &apos;ve always taught you to try your best .
i need you to try your best now .
there , see ?
you &apos;re doing it .
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can . fight the urge .
daddy , i &apos;m starving .
i know you are , car . try .
why ? you know that this isn &apos;t going to work .
it has to work . it &apos;s the only option .
why are you trying to fix me ?
so i don &apos;t have to kill you !
daddy , i &apos;m sorry .
the sun &apos;s gone down .
we &apos;ll try again tomorrow .
hello , bill .
put the gun down , liz .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
that &apos;s our daughter in there .
she looks up to you . she loves you .
then she &apos;ll trust me to do the right thing .
let me do this , liz . not because she &apos;s a monster ,
but because we love her .
tyler .
you &apos;re not going in there .
go ahead .
tyler .
it &apos;s ok . we &apos;re going to get you out of here .
my ring . my ring .
ok .
so i &apos;m confused . if we were such great friends ,
why do i only know you as the hybrid dick
who sacrificed my girlfriend on an altar of fire ?
all good things must come to an end .
they &apos;re using wooden bullets . they know .
that means he &apos;s here .
who ?
who &apos;s here ?
rebekah ! come on , we &apos;ve got to go , sweetheart .
what the hell is going on ?
stefan !
go !
stefan .
i &apos;m sorry , but the fun has to end here .
what are you talking about ?
you must forget rebekah and me .
until i say otherwise , you never knew us , stefan .
thank you . i had forgotten
what it was like to have a brother .
you compelled me to forget .
it was time for rebekah and i to move on .
better to have a clean slate .
but why ?
you shouldn &apos;t have to cover your tracks ...
unless you &apos;re running from someone .
storytime &apos;s over .
i need another drink .
a real one .
what is wrong with you ? !
what is wrong with you ?
you kill andie one day , you save my life the next .
what are you good , bad ? pick one !
klaus almost saw elena today .
you have to get her out of chicago .
she &apos;s not going anywhere until she &apos;s got you
checked into vampire rehab and on the mend .
trust me . i &apos;ve tried .
she is the key to everything .
klaus can &apos;t know that she &apos;s alive .
what are you talking about ?
she was supposed to die in the sacrifice and she didn &apos;t .
now klaus can &apos;t create any new hybrids .
his witch is seconds away from figuring that out .
tell elena to go home and forget about me .
tell her yourself .
last call . drink &apos; em up .
i see they &apos;ve opened the doors to the riff raff now .
oh , honey , i &apos;ve been called worse .
you don &apos;t give up , do you ?
give me my brother back ...
you &apos;ll never have to see me again .
well , i am torn .
you see , i promised stefan i wouldn &apos;t let you die ,
but how many freebies did i really sign up for ?
and clearly you want to die ,
otherwise you wouldn &apos;t be here , so ...
what can i say ?
i &apos;m a thrill seeker .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
where else would i be ?
what do you want ?
damon won &apos;t be able to distract klaus for long .
come home .
how much clearer can i make it ?
i don &apos;t want to come home !
oh , dear , what was that ?
i &apos;m a little boozey ,
so you &apos;ll forgive me if i miss your heart the first few tries .
no , that &apos;s not it . hmm .
ohh . almost .
you want a partner in crime ?
forget stefan .
i &apos;m so much more fun .
you won &apos;t be any fun after you &apos;re dead .
really ?
not in my bar . you take it outside .
you don &apos;t have to negotiate your brother &apos;s freedom .
when i &apos;m done with him ,
he won &apos;t want to go back .
klaus is obsessed with siring these hybrids .
the second he knows you &apos;re alive ,
he &apos;ll figure out why it &apos;s not working .
look , i know you &apos;re trying to protect me ,
but i can &apos;t let you do it .
come with me , stefan , please .
and what do you expect if i do ? huh ?
it &apos;s never going to be the same , elena .
i know that .
i don &apos;t think you do .
i &apos;ve left bodies scattered from florida to tennessee .
innocent people . humans .
lexi found you like this before .
in the twenties , and she saved you .
and you know what i did after that ?
i spent 30 years trying to pull myself together .
to a vampire , that &apos;s nothing .
to you ? that &apos;s half your life .
i can &apos;t give up on you , stefan .
yes , you can . it &apos;s done .
that part of my life is done .
i don &apos;t want to see you .
i don &apos;t want to be with you .
i just want you to go .
you ok ?
just drive .
thank you .
honey , your dad ...
all our families ,
we have beliefs that have been passed on through generations .
and we were taught never to stray from them .
you did .
you taught me to look at things in a different way .
i just thought that he was the one who got me .
he did . he will again .
hey , mom ?
thanks for believing in me .
would now be a bad time
to give you crap about sneaking out on me ?
he hates me .
my dad hates me .
rebekah ...
it &apos;s your big brother .
come out , come out , wherever you are .
go to hell , nik !
hurry up , rebekah .
let &apos;s go .
he &apos;ll be here any second .
do you want to die ? we &apos;ve been found .
we need to move .
not without stefan .
stefan &apos;s not coming .
we have to disappear . he &apos;ll draw too much attention .
let him go .
what did you do ?
come on . we don &apos;t have time for one of your tantrums .
i don &apos;t want to run anymore , nik ! all we do is run .
i want to be with stefan .
fine .
then choose .
him or me .
that &apos;s what i thought .
get in the truck . let &apos;s go .
good @-@ bye , nik .
don &apos;t pout . you knew it wouldn &apos;t kill me .
yeah , but i was hoping it would hurt more .
i understand that you &apos;re upset with me , rebekah ...
so i &apos;m going to let that go .
just this once .
brought you a little peace offering .
you can come in .
stefan ?
now you remember .
rebekah .
stefan ...
hey , buddy , take a picture of my brother and me .
i remember you .
we were friends .
we are friends .
and now the reason you &apos;re here .
gloria tells me
you know how to contact the original witch .
the original witch .
what do you have that gloria needs ?
where &apos;s my necklace ?
what did you do with it ? i never take it off !
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t touch it .
we need to find it , nik .
now , i want it back !
tell me that &apos;s not what she needs ,
rebekah !
ok . you were right .
he was there .
i &apos;m always right .
let me guess-- it ended in tears and heartbreak .
where are you ?
why ?
do you want to come rub sunscreen on my back ?
i &apos;m thinking europe . italy , maybe .
or spain .
you were always a sucker for those lazy afternoons .
keep guessing , damon . bye @-@ bye .
hey , kid .
chicago p.d.
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
oh , i &apos;m not here for you .
have you seen these two ?
i &apos;ve never seen those people before in my life .
