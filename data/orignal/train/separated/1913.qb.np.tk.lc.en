&quot; sorry seems to be the hardest word &quot;
let &apos;s see . maybe ...
crap .
doctors never mean to screw up .
crap , crap , crap . crap !
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to call for--
no ! there &apos;s no time .
you make a bad call , and ...
the unthinkable happens .
can i help you ?
yeah , do you have any just , um , regular panty hose ?
we can &apos;t do that .
well , we have to . lap pads !
but we still haven &apos;t--
i don &apos;t care ! we &apos;re closing him up .
zero vicryl . zero vicryl now .
am i not being clear ? why do you look so confused ? why--
what about these ? they &apos;re popular . they shimmer .
no . no , no shimmer .
no footless tights
or freaky little toe sock thingies .
i just--i just want panty hose , basic nude .
i used to buy them at the grocery store .
they come--they come in a little plastic egg kind of panty hose !
that &apos;s--that &apos;s what i need !
is that really so hard to understand ? !
it &apos;s not like we do it on purpose .
it &apos;s not like we want to hurt anyone .
but sometimes we do .
sometimes we make mistakes .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
and when we blow it , we &apos;re sorry .
that was--that was inappropriate .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m under a lot of pressure right now ,
and i have a really big day tomorrow .
you know what ? that &apos;s fine .
these are--these are-- these are fine . these are great .
actually , i &apos;ll take all these .
i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna take &apos; em all .
really ?
yeah .
just , uh , ring me up .
even these , the ones with the rhinestones ?
even those . okay .
not that being sorry really matters .
not anymore .
no apology in the world matters now .
brain mapping is not an exact science yet .
but this array brings us one step closer .
dr. torres and i have had tremendous success so far ,
and because of that ,
we are moving from an animated hand
to a robotic one .
oh , she &apos;s on the stage .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . are you lost ?
sorry . i &apos;m looking for ... dr. torres ?
yes . hi .
great . you &apos;re being sued .
love what you &apos;re doing here , by the way .
robot hands . freaky !
who is that from ?
travis reed ?
uh @-@ huh .
as in the travis reed , the snowboarder ?
uh , he needs a new hip .
i told him he wants you .
wait . how do you even know him ?
i was a second @-@ year resident .
he was my first solo valve replacement .
yeah , and six months before he came out of nowhere
and won all those gold medals on the half @-@ pipe .
i believe my valve is what gives him his edge .
his heart is my &quot; mona lisa . &quot;
don &apos;t screw it up .
excuse me . where &apos;s the onesie decorating station ?
there isn &apos;t one .
there &apos;s a margarita decorating station , though .
what ?
limes .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what kind of baby shower ...
salt .
doesn &apos;t have a onesie decorating station ?
i mean , i had already figured out my design .
it was gonna be a star and a moon ,
and it was gonna say &quot; mcdreamy . &quot;
get it ? that &apos;s cute , right ?
excuse me .
is it time to open the gifts yet ? i need to sit down .
my feet are like sausages .
oh , come on , mer .
oh , look at her . she &apos;s all glowy and pregnant ,
with sausage feet .
let &apos;s have a baby .
what ?
wait . wait , what ? are you serious ?
we &apos;ve had such a hard year since the crash ,
and ... wouldn &apos;t it be nice
to have something new and happy to think about ?
yes . yes . but , um , i--
and , you know , i could carry-- i could carry this time .
and then that way , only one of our feet would be sausages .
arizona ...
so ... you want to ?
yes ! oh , my god , yes !
you seem happy .
oh , i am happy . i am really , really happy .
he is so much more attractive in person .
i got him to sign my board .
i got him to sign my bra .
yeah , sign my cast !
so are they .
cristina yang !
oh , you look better and better every time i see you .
dump your husband . run away with me .
oh , come on . don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
oh , we &apos;ve got a deal .
i &apos;m allowed to flirt with hot doctors
who &apos;ve had their hands inside my chest .
it &apos;s a very short list .
hey , i &apos;m travis .
hi .
you &apos;re the ortho god ?
callie torres . i prefer goddess .
right on .
ready to build me a new hip ?
he needs to be able to do this .
see ? right ... there .
can a new hip do that ?
more importantly , will he be doing it by december ?
he &apos;s got olympic qualifiers coming up .
you mentioned a crash last year ?
they said it gave me arthritis .
he can &apos;t win the gold with arthritis .
i want the peterson hip .
buddy of mine got this one .
he was back on the mountain in no time .
this is what i need .
okay .
even if i did agree that a hip replacement
is the right course of treatment ,
i @-@ i &apos;ve never even used , the , uh ,
peterson resurfacing hip joint .
i doubt you or your team want you to be my first .
she makes a good point .
i was yang &apos;s first valve replacement . that worked out .
i was the first guy to land a triple cork in competition .
now it &apos;s practically standard .
you &apos;re the first orthopedic surgeon to grow cartilage
out of nothing .
the reason we are who we are ,
is &apos; cause we &apos;re not scared of firsts .
i &apos;ll research the joint . i &apos;ll learn what i can .
i &apos;m not making any promises .
i &apos;m not worried .
you &apos;re gonna say &quot; yes . &quot;
for the hundredth time , no .
i am not admitting to negligence
when there was no negligence . i--
they &apos;re willing to call you a &quot; nonparty at fault . &quot;
jury payouts are always bigger than pretrial settlements .
if this goes south--
do you think it &apos;ll go south ?
there was a minor complication during surgery
because we thought the patient had developed
a pulmonary embolus .
postoperative infections are a common recognized risk .
everybody--
and that &apos;s when the jury &apos;s eyes will glaze over .
all they &apos;re gonna hear is a bunch of big words
they don &apos;t understand . and what they will see
is that you made a mistake , and your patient paid the price .
no , it wasn &apos;t a mistake ,
greg . i &apos;m not settling .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
then there are things to remember tomorrow--
let the jury see your face . you wear a suit .
dark not bright . skirt not pants .
minimal jewelry , heels ,
panty hose--
panty hose ?
professional but feminine .
you still have your wedding ring ?
yes .
wear it .
juries respond better to married women with families .
now there &apos;ll be water in front of your seat .
you drink it sparingly .
there are no bathroom breaks
till the judge calls for recess .
i don &apos;t own any panty hose .
i @-@ i @-@ i have to go shopping .
did you flush ?
i didn &apos;t @-@ i didn &apos;t hear you flush .
oh , and wash your hands ! it &apos;s almost time to go !
hey , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late . there was traffic .
no , no , it &apos;s fine . she &apos;s ready .
well , she was until she decided she had to wear
the purple dress instead of the heart dress .
and then she had to go potty
but she didn &apos;t want help going potty . sofia !
you should probably go check
and make sure she &apos;s okay in there .
what--are you okay ?
uh , i have no idea .
hey , listen , i know you &apos;re supposed to have sofia tonight ,
but if it &apos;d be easier for you to spend some time alone
or if you &apos;d rather not be alone then , you know ,
you just tell me , and whatever you need that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
okay , thanks .
what ?
nothing .
you put your ring back on .
they told me to .
anyway , good luck today .
thanks .
you ready ?
sure .
excuse me . no comment .
doctor , what happened ?
greg ? greg ? !
step aside .
good morning .
hey , what are you doing here ?
uh , a bunch of us are taking shifts .
we wanted you to have at least one person
in court with you the entire time .
i had to fight bailey for this first shift .
turns out she punches pretty hard for such a little person .
excuse us ! thank you .
dr. torres !
i can &apos;t even swallow . my mouth is so dry .
you can do this . i will be sitting right behind you .
we &apos;re up here .
callie ?
oh , damn it !
all rise !
would if i could .
crap .
this case is about a man that you probably already know--
at least by reputation , mr. travis reed .
i got here as soon as i could .
my nephrectomy went long . what &apos;d i miss ?
they &apos;re still on opening statements .
this guy &apos;s been going for a while .
he &apos;s doing that folksy charm thing ,
and the jury is eating it up .
now serving as a juror in a medical malpractice case isn &apos;t easy .
i don &apos;t know about y &apos;all , but i &apos;m no doctor .
hell , i barely made it through high school biology , so ...
but you are going to get a crash course education
in orthopedic medicine and postoperative infections .
and you &apos;re gonna hear words like &quot; pseudomonas &quot; and &quot; emboli . &quot;
don &apos;t let that intimidate you .
the only thing that matters is the evidence .
those things are part of the evidence .
what is he talking about ?
shh .
and the evidence in this case will focus on
a 16 @-@ day period last spring .
and during this time we will establish that dr. torres
agreed to perform a surgery she did not fully understand .
we will establish that dr. torres made a series
of faulty decisions , eventually costing mr. travis reed--
a thriving , healthy olympic athlete--
his legs .
and we will establish that all of this started
because of one careless mistake made in surgery .
implant &apos;s in place . everything looks good .
now i just need to irrigate--
his heart rate just jumped to the 150s .
having trouble ventilating .
increasing his oxygen to 100 % .
damn it . all right , could be a p.e.
we &apos;ve gotta get him off this table .
all right , let &apos;s start closing . irrigation , please .
wait , the sponge count is off .
we &apos;re missing one sponge .
are you kidding me ?
we can &apos;t close until we find it .
sats are continuing to drop . switching to manual ventilation .
all right , you know , it &apos;s gotta be on someone &apos;s shoe
or something . there &apos;s nothing in here .
you want me to call for a portable x @-@ ray ?
no , that &apos;ll take too long . he could go into shock .
b.p. &apos; s dropped to 70 over 40 .
oh , crap , crap , crap , crap , crap , crap .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to call for ...
no , there &apos;s no time .
all right , we &apos;re closing him up .
you can &apos;t do that !
well , you know , uh , we have to . lap pads .
we still haven &apos;t--
i don &apos;t care . we &apos;re closing him up .
zero vicryl .
zero vicryl now !
now !
hang on , hang on , hang on .
are you saying that dr. torres knew she left a sponge
in mr. reed &apos;s body ,
and she didn &apos;t care ?
no , of course she cared but ...
no , but still ,
she knowingly left behind a sponge .
the patient was running out of time . he would have--
hon , hon , it &apos;s a yes or no question . thank you .
did she knowingly leave a sponge ?
yes .
you know , i &apos;ve got a-- i &apos;ve got a boy in college . good kid .
and i went to visit him last month ,
and you would not believe the sponge i found in his sink .
i mean , there &apos;s no tellin &apos; what was going on--
objection . irrelevant .
sustained .
all right , let &apos;s fast @-@ forward
to the next time you saw mr. reed .
about two weeks later .
and how was he then ?
was he ... good ? happy ? recovering well ?
he had an infection .
hi , there .
travis , i hear you got quite the fever .
temp &apos;s 103 . i &apos;m just starting his workup .
he &apos;s burning up . he won &apos;t eat .
i had to force him to come in .
how are you feeling , travis ?
i &apos;ve seen worse .
dr. torres , you wanna take a listen to this ?
yeah .
is that a murmur ?
a small one . travis ,
i &apos;m just gonna take a look at your incision site , okay ?
oh , wow .
oh , wow ? what does &quot; oh , wow &quot; mean ?
whitney , i don &apos;t want you to worry .
the wound looks a little infected .
so we &apos;re just gonna go in and clean it all out , okay ?
yeah . okay .
okay , get him on vanc and clinda , stat .
call upstairs . i need an o.r. right now .
what about the murmur ?
could the infection have traveled to his heart ?
his vitals are stable .
so first , we &apos;ve got to clean out that joint , okay ?
we can &apos;t afford any delays .
okay . should i call yang ?
all right , if she &apos;s not available in the next five minutes ,
she waits until post @-@ op .
we &apos;ve got to get in there
and kill this infection before it spreads any further .
i am not turning an olympic athlete into a doorstop .
yeah , the infection &apos;s going through the fascia
down to the prosthesis .
get in here and irrigate before we move on .
looks like there &apos;s pus in the acetabulum .
oh , damn it !
no , there &apos;s no way to salvage the joint .
i &apos;m gonna have to remove the whole thing .
and just ... leave him with no hip ?
well , for now .
it &apos;s the only way to get this completely cleaned out .
osteotome and mallet ?
that sounds pretty nasty .
post @-@ op infections are very common . they happen all the time .
is that your professional opinion ?
it is .
i see .
and in your professional opinion ,
is it also common for a post @-@ op infection
to result in a double amputation ?
does that happen all the time , too ?
no , but , uh ...
no , uh , no further questions , your honor .
that &apos;s not fair ! you &apos;re not letting me finish .
that &apos;s enough , dr. wilson .
but i need to explain ...
another word out of turn , and i &apos;ll hold you in contempt .
tell me i packed a spare pair .
oh , thank god .
oh , hi . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;ll come back .
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m just , um , i have to sit in there and listen to that guy .
and i can &apos;t react
or that &apos;ll make me look unlikable or petty .
but how the hell am i not supposed to react ?
he &apos;s awful .
and he &apos;s making me sound awful .
i think i have something that will make you feel better .
so sofia drew this in the car this morning .
and she said that it &apos;s of a jellyfish and a rainbow mermaid .
i &apos;m not sure which one is which .
but you should have it .
and then when you feel like screaming ,
you can look at the jellyfish and then it will calm you down .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re here .
thanks .
thank you .
i should get back . oh , god .
um , callie ?
yes ?
are you sure that you wanna wear , um ,
rhinestone butterflies in court ?
i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s your choice .
it &apos;s a strange one .
but i suppose that lots of people like butterflies so ...
they &apos;re cute .
what ?
are you kidding me ?
no more ridiculous than vetoing every guy under 6 &apos; 3 . &quot;
we are not choosing our sperm donor based on his taste in music .
well ... oh , look . oh , this one &apos;s cute .
oh , that &apos;s a super cute baby .
he would make super cute babies .
yeah !
mm @-@ hmm .
okay , so . here ...
he &apos;s a college dropout .
pass .
pass .
okay , uh--ooh , i &apos;m empty .
now this one says he &apos;s a mathematician
with a graduate degree .
and ... he runs marathons .
oh , picture ?
okay , um ...
well , i still like the ivy league poet .
okay , let &apos;s ...
smart and crtive .
you think i &apos;ll like being pregnant ?
oh , yeah . it &apos;s the best .
oh , except for the nausea . oh , and the stretch marks .
and the peeing .
and the lack of sleep , the exhaustion .
oh , and then the ... the no booze .
no booze .
mnh @-@ mnh .
oh , i will miss you most of all .
arizona ?
you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re early . i thought--
i thought you said you weren &apos;t bringing her by till after dinner .
daddy .
mija .
you mentioned the trial like it was nothing .
it &apos;s never nothing .
you know how many times i &apos;ve been sued ?
my lawyer &apos;s on speed dial , for crying out loud .
he &apos;s very good . technically , his tactics are legal .
you really didn &apos;t have to come all this way .
of course i did . of course i did .
my baby &apos;s in trouble .
but first , where &apos;s my grandbaby ? mm @-@ hmm . come on , now .
abuelo needs a hug .
don &apos;t tell me she &apos;s already asleep .
no . n @-@ no . she &apos;s , um ...
she &apos;s--well , she &apos;s not here .
arizona &apos;s gonna bring her by in an hour .
oh , all right . well , i don &apos;t understand .
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
we split up . she cheated on me . it &apos;s been bad .
i really don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
when did this happen ?
a couple months ago .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i just , i didn &apos;t wanna get into it , dad .
i @-@ i fought so hard just to get you to accept us .
mom hasn &apos;t spoken to me since the wedding .
and i just ... appantly , i marry people who cheat on me .
it &apos;s pathetic .
i am pathetic .
no .
when that o &apos;malley kid cheated on you ,
i was ready to knock his teeth out .
now--now i won &apos;t hit a lady but , you know , i can make it happen .
i know people . just say the word , all right ?
no , dad . god , no .
all right .
look at me .
mija , look at me .
nothing about you is pathetic .
don &apos;t hate me !
i know i said i was gonna cook dinner tonight ,
but i &apos;ve still got a lot of work to catch up on .
so ... who wants pizza ?
hey , sweetie . where &apos;s mommy ?
callie ?
yeah . hi , i &apos;m home !
is everything okay ?
callie !
are you okay ? is ev @-@ everything all right ?
we &apos;re having a baby .
my boobs were hurting , and-- and then i thought ... maybe ?
but i &apos;m only a day late and i @-@ i didn &apos;t even think
that it would show up on a test so soon .
we &apos;re having a baby !
we &apos;re having a baby !
hi .
hi , sweet baby .
all right , gonna make this quick .
i know we are all busy .
callie , i thought you understood you can &apos;t be here .
i know .
i know it &apos;s a conflict of interest .
i just--i wanted to say something before you get started .
travis reed is suing both me and the hospital .
i have no intention of settling with him ,
but the hospital should .
as an owner and a member of the board ,
i know how hard it &apos;s been to get this place back on its feet .
and i don &apos;t want you to jeopardize that because of me .
what did our legal team say ?
um , yeah , they said that we should settle now , quickly and quietly .
what if we don &apos;t ?
well , this thing goes to trial
and there &apos;s a judgment against us ,
we could owe millions or we could settle this for much less .
if we go to trial , we risk bankruptcy all over again .
only if we lose . there &apos;s another side to this .
if callie isn &apos;t settling , maybe neither should we .
uh , no . i was there .
i saw firsthand what happened with this patient .
and he has a case . a good case .
we should settle .
and , frankly , callie should , too .
dr. yang , what is your relationship with travis reed ?
uh , travis first came to me six years ago
with a bicuspid aortic valve .
i replaced the valve ,
and have overseen his cardiac care ever since .
and it was you , i believe , who recommended him to dr. torres .
is that right ?
that &apos;s right .
why was that ?
because she was the best orthopedic surgeon i knew .
was ?
as in past tense ?
you don &apos;t believe she &apos;s the best anymore ?
there are vegetations all over his aortic valve .
why didn &apos;t you page me sooner ?
we just heard the murmur this morning .
this morning ?
look at this growth . you knew he was a heart patient .
this didn &apos;t concern you ?
of course it did . that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
so what do we do ?
the infection is eating away at his graft .
best case--i go in , clean it out , and repair it .
worst case--he needs a whole new valve .
dr. torres , you need to see this .
i was changing his compression socks and i saw this .
his leg &apos;s gray , cold . i can &apos;t find a pulse .
okay , where &apos;s whitney ?
i told her she had time to grab lunch before travis woke up .
all right , you need to go find her
and tell her that travis needs another surgery .
okay .
okay , i &apos;ve gotta go in and do an embolectomy on this leg--
unh @-@ unh , no . i gotta go in and fix his heart .
you can do that later . i need to do this now .
later ? it &apos;s already later .
he has lost blood flow !
he &apos;s clearly throwing emboli into his extremities .
and where do you think the emboli is coming from ?
his infected heart .
cristina--
hey , hey , hey !
i can hear you two from all the way the damn hallway .
will you tell callie to back off and let me do my job ?
yeah , tell cristina to back off and let me do mine .
if i don &apos;t try this embolectomy ,
he could lose his leg .
well , he can live without a leg .
he can &apos;t live without a functioning heart .
look , if you do the heart tomorrow ,
it gives him an extra day on antibiotics , all right ?
he &apos;ll be more stable , and the heart surgery will be less risky .
cristina , this is travis reed we &apos;re talking about .
let me try to save his leg .
dr. torres performed the embolectomy that afternoon .
against your wishes ?
we had a professional difference of opinion .
you know , in my office , if one of my co @-@ workers
was shouting at me so loudly that
you could hear him all the way down the hall ,
it would more than just a difference of opinion .
it would be grounds for a dismissal .
we are passionate about our work .
and in the end , i agreed with dr. torres ,
that the heart surgery could wait .
you agreed ?
yes .
are you sure you weren &apos;t bullied ?
objection .
yeah , i know .
the embolectomy could not have gone better .
i mean , his leg was already pinking up
by the time i saw him in recovery last night .
what &apos;s his temp ?
oh , he was febrile overnight but his white count &apos;s stable .
what &apos;s going on ?
travis ?
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
what the hell is wrong with my legs ? !
are we losing this case ?
it &apos;s ... too early to panic .
we haven &apos;t presented our side .
there she is .
richard ! well , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
that &apos;s what i told him , but he insisted on coming .
it &apos;s a miracle i made it here at all .
kepner &apos;s a terrible driver .
how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
you knew it was bad .
his legs were black . i knew it wasn &apos;t good .
they cut them off that night .
now did you have any indication that dr. torres
was even worried about something like amputation ?
i mean , did she ever mention that it might be even a risk ?
no .
but she was worried about it .
she was worried about what it would do to her reputation .
what is she talking about ?
now why would you say that ?
i @-@ i have no idea .
i heard her talking in the hallway .
she didn &apos;t know i could hear her .
what did she say ?
she said , &quot; i can &apos;t be the doctor
who turns an olympic athlete into a doorstop . &quot;
all right , quiet down !
quiet down , everyone !
quiet down !
do we knock ?
no , there &apos;s an open house on sunday .
we can come back then .
oh , oh ! there &apos;s a swing set !
oh , and a pool ! a pool !
callie there &apos;s a pool !
ooh ! yeah ?
yeah .
oh , i can just see us
playing with the girls in this yard ,
having a picnic , and swinging on the swings .
ohh . what makes you think we &apos;re having another girl ?
come on .
can you get off of that thing for five seconds
and look at this place ?
yeah , i know , hold on a second .
i &apos;m just , uh , i &apos;m following up on that clinical trial
in germany using peterson hip joints .
i &apos;m trying to get them to send me their data .
well , they &apos;re not gonna release anything until it &apos;s published .
eh . it &apos;s worth a shot .
there , sent .
all right , now you can show me the swing set .
okay .
you okay ? you all right ?
yeah . i got it .
i &apos;ve got it .
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth ?
i do .
hey , travis .
hey .
you know , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m thinking about snowboarding .
in fact , i picked up a board--
a burton blunt .
you familiar with that one ?
that &apos;s a good board .
there &apos;s better boards for beginners .
what size shoe are you ?
i &apos;m a 13 .
you might wanna look into an extra wide ,
so your toes don &apos;t hang over too much .
a little over hang &apos;s fine ,
but too much is gonna cause drag .
and drag &apos;s bad ?
well--
objection , your honor . where &apos;s this going ?
look , i &apos;m simple consulting an expert on snowboarding
about a snowboard .
i mean , who should i trust more ,
this guy or the kid who &apos;s helping me out at r.e.i. ?
get to the point , mr. hamilton .
travis , when you first met dr. torres ,
did you ask her about a certain kind of joint ?
the peterson joint .
i &apos;d heard it was good for athletes .
you know , quicker recovery , better range of motion .
so you were consulting an expert on joint replacement
about a joint .
yeah .
is it true that dr. torres had never actually done
an operation with this kind of joint before ?
it &apos;s true .
but you went ahead with it anyway .
she said she had done a lot of research .
she said she was confident .
so you trusted her to use her expertise to advise you ,
and to keep you safe .
when , in fact , what you got was a botched surgery ,
an infection , a revision surgery ,
a heart surgery ... and ...
i mean , look at you now .
just let me pull up the blanket .
why ? so you don &apos;t have to look at them ?
there &apos;s nothing there .
is it her ?
hey , travis .
tell her to go .
i don &apos;t wanna see her . i don &apos;t wanna talk to her .
um , i just brought you some information on support groups .
um , try to get him to go . and , oh , on the back ,
there &apos;s a name of an incredible prosthetist--
tell her to get out . i trusted her .
i trusted her completely , and ...
you know , i get that people live without legs
and it &apos;s not the end of the world , but ...
it &apos;s the end of my world .
i &apos;ve been snowboarding since i was 5 .
i used to steal cafeteria trays from school
and ride &apos; em down my parents &apos; driveway .
snow or no snow , i didn &apos;t care .
it was the thing i did for fun .
then it became my job and my world .
and now it &apos;s ... everything--
my family , my friends .
without it ...
i don &apos;t know who i am .
and now it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s just ...
gone .
and it &apos;s dr. torres &apos; fault .
you feel very strongly about that .
it &apos;s not just a feeling .
i know it . she told me .
what , she admitted that she was at fault ?
yes , she did .
the day she cut off my legs , she came into my room ,
she &apos;d been crying .
she told me she was sorry .
objection !
it is illegal to use a physician &apos;s apology
against them as evidence of guilt .
your honor , this isn &apos;t about the apology .
this is about everything else she said with the apology .
i &apos;ll allow it .
travis , i know this is gonna be painful ,
so you take your time .
what else did dr. torres say ?
she said if there was anyone to blame , it was her .
she said this never should &apos;ve happened .
she said if there was any way
she could change things , she would .
those were her exact words ?
yes , they were .
the prosecution rests .
yes , we had so much fun today . big hugs .
i love you . i love you .
mwah . i know !
okay , all right , honey . i &apos;ll see you soon .
hey , your dad &apos;s making me a little nervous .
yeah , you should probably go now .
definitely go now .
bye !
bye !
bye bye !
bye bye !
thank you for not saying anything to her .
if my grandbaby hadn &apos;t been standing right there ,
believe me , i would &apos;ve said plenty .
dad , don &apos;t start right now . i have to be in court soon .
i have to take the stand today , and i &apos;m just ...
your mother and i have been married 38 years .
you think it &apos;s been easy ?
no , don &apos;t .
you think we haven &apos;t had troubles ?
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t start comparing . don &apos;t .
what happened to her &quot; good man in a storm &quot; baloney ?
it &apos;s not right . she should be here
every day trying to fix it .
it &apos;s not like that .
oh , no ? the hell it isn &apos;t .
she hurt you . and now she &apos;s too much of a coward
to even-- to even face you .
now she &apos;s running away abandoning her family .
no , she &apos;s not running away , all right ? i kicked her out .
it was my choice to split up . it was mine .
all right , so just drop it , okay ?
you chose to break up your family ?
dad , not now .
did you even try to work things out ?
dad
i knew what i was doing .
i did extensive research on the peterson hip .
i even spoke with the team who invented it .
everyone agreed that travis was an ideal candidate .
and the surgery ? it went smoothly ?
the cut position and the femoral resurfacing were perfect .
what wasn &apos;t perfect ?
well , at the end of surgery , the patient desatted--
which means his oxygen level went down
and his heart was beating really fast ,
which is really dangerous .
we thought he might have a clot in his lungs ,
so it was vital we finish the surgery quickly .
and that &apos;s when you left the sponge .
yes .
and i would do it again .
well , the patient &apos;s life was at risk .
i @-@ i believe that the sponge wouldn &apos;t compromise the joint .
i made a call , and i was right .
it was the right call .
so leaving the sponge was deliberate .
not a mistake .
you weren &apos;t being careless or distracted .
make sure his b.p. and o @-@ 2 sats stay stable .
and bring me his post @-@ op x @-@ ray .
i wanna locate that sponge .
got it .
you missed our appointment . hmm ?
oh , damn it !
i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry . i-- my surgery went long ,
and i completely forgot . how &apos;d it go ?
i mean , i know the ultrasound &apos;s just a blob at this point ,
but still ...
did you get a picture of the blob ?
there &apos;s no picture .
and no heartbeat .
what ?
she did the ultrasound and she looked and she looked .
but there &apos;s no heartbeat .
we lost the baby ?
i remember the day very clearly .
i wasn &apos;t distracted .
sure , i had other things going on .
big things , actually .
but ... it &apos;s my job to prioritize my patient ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i did .
i wasn &apos;t focused on anything or ...
anyone other than my patient .
let &apos;s talk about this embolectomy .
dr. yang wanted to do the heart surgery first .
you wanted to work on travis &apos;s leg .
yes .
why ?
well , his foot was turning gray ,
which is an indication that the limb is starting to die .
and i wanted to restore blood flow .
once a limb turns black , there &apos;s nothing we can do .
according to dr. yang &apos;s testimony , she wanted to go first
because the infection had moved to travis &apos;s heart ,
throwing out emboli-- or clots-- all over his body .
and she knew that the heart would keep throwing out clots
until it was repaired . so--
do you cook ?
uh , a little .
okay , let &apos;s say you &apos;re cooking ,
and you start a grease fire in your kitchen .
and then it spreads to your curtains .
what do you do ?
do you put out the grease fire ?
or do you extinguish the curtains ?
which disaster do you tackle first ?
if i hadn &apos;t treated the emboli when i did ,
travis would &apos;ve lost his leg for sure .
i was just picking which disaster to tackle first .
i cannot believe you &apos;re picking this fight right now !
i &apos;m not trying to pick a fight .
i am trying to tell you how i feel .
okay , well , i feel like crap , too .
okay ? it wasn &apos;t just your kid .
i know . i know that .
look , we just--we &apos;ll just , look , we don &apos;t--
we don &apos;t have to try again right away , all right ?
we can wait a while before we try again .
no . we--
no , no . you &apos;re missing the point .
what point ?
i can &apos;t take another loss , callie .
i can &apos;t handle it !
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t think about this right now .
it &apos;s just--it &apos;s too hard . it &apos;s just too hard !
what--what are you saying ?
now you don &apos;t want another baby ?
answer me .
i don &apos;t know .
i have to go check on my patient .
tell her to get out !
travis--
i don &apos;t want her here . kick her out , whit , now !
god knows i can &apos;t do it by myself .
so get her the hell out of here !
what &apos;s wrong with you ? ! why aren &apos;t you doing anything ? !
okay , that &apos;s enough !
whitney , go to the family lounge and get a snack .
we need a minute , okay ?
don &apos;t you dare take this out on her .
you are hurt and angry
and you have every right to feel those things .
but whitney has nothing to do with that .
you--you wanna take your crap out on somebody ,
you take it out on me , all right ? i can handle it .
you--you need somebody to blame ? then blame me . go on .
yell all you want .
this never should &apos;ve happened to you .
and if there were any way ,
that i could magically change things ,
believe me , i would .
i wish there was something i could do .
i wish i could fix this .
i tried . i tried so hard .
i &apos;m so sorry , travis .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
yes , i apologized .
i understood what travis was feeling .
i went through the same thing with my wife .
she ... she lost her leg last year ,
and , um , it &apos;s changed us .
it &apos;s , uh , cost us in ways that i ...
i can &apos;t even begin to understand .
i wouldn &apos;t wish this experience on anyone .
and now it was happening to my patient .
of course i was sorry .
i still am .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m so , so sorry this happened to you , travis .
th @-@ that makes me human .
that does not make me negligent .
and if i can &apos;t feel for my patients without getting sued ,
then i guess i &apos;m just gonna keep on getting sued ,
because that &apos;s who i am .
i won &apos;t apologize for that .
dad , we &apos;re home .
we &apos;re back . oh , i guess he &apos;s still out in the park with the girls .
how long do you think it &apos;s gonna take
for the jury to come back ?
i don &apos;t know . could be days , sometimes weeks .
what &apos;s that ?
i think it &apos;s from a clinical trial on the peterson hip .
i thought i never heard back .
&quot; enclosed is the data you requested . &quot;
&quot; but please be advised ,
we &apos;ve currently put a stop to our trial .
there &apos;ve been five instances
of infection caused by the pseudomonas bacteria . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ve traced the source back to the peterson joint . &quot;
what &apos;s the postmark on that ?
three weeks before travis &apos; surgery .
i can &apos;t just sit on this . i have to tell them , right ?
i wouldn &apos;t . you didn &apos;t willfully ignore any data .
you didn &apos;t act irresponsibly or maliciously .
you worked off the information you had at the time .
and then an act of god happened .
the letter fell behind the bookcase .
it could &apos;ve just as easily gotten lost in the mail .
but it didn &apos;t .
accidents happens.it &apos;s the job .
this one happened in your living room , not in the o.r ..
i--you know , i @-@ i was distracted . i @-@ i wasn &apos;t paying attention .
i should &apos;ve followed up when i never heard back .
you feel bad because of what happened ,
and anybody would .
but that envelope is not a magic cure .
it &apos;s not going to grow his legs back .
but what it could do ? it could sway a jury .
it could make a jury think differently about you ,
and that could end your career--
not because you were negligent
and not because you did anything wrong ,
but because you feel bad ? because you feel guilty ?
let &apos;s not confuse emotion with fact .
and the fact is , you did nothing wrong .
yes , i did .
hey .
okay . thanks .
they &apos;ve reached a verdict .
we &apos;ve all done things we aren &apos;t proud of .
i understand that .
i know nobody &apos;s perfect .
but how do you live with it ?
how do you get up every morning and face the world ,
knowing you could &apos;ve done better ?
that you should &apos;ve done better ?
is being sorry enough ?
can an apology actually heal our wounds ?
ease our pain ?
can they undo the hurt that have caused ?
i really don &apos;t think so , dad .
i @-@ it &apos;s not enough . just because she says she &apos;s sorry ...
you &apos;re married . you took a vow .
you don &apos;t walk away from that .
if things get hard , you work harder .
i mean , you have a child together , for god &apos;s sake .
she cheated on me .
i cheated on your mother .
what ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . what ? !
a long time ago .
we--we--we were young . i was stupid .
but your mother found it in her heart to forgive me .
why ? why would she do that ?
why ?
because she believed we were stronger than one mistake .
and i thank god every day she did .
because otherwise , i wouldn &apos;t have you .
38 years .
we &apos;ve shared a life .
and it all started after that one mistake .
now things between you and arizona might not work out .
you know , you might not be able to fix it .
but how will you know if you never try ?
just a second !
oh , you &apos;re not bringing me extra pillows .
you did something impulsive ,
and , uh , you were thinking about yourself .
it seemed right at the time ,
and , uh ...
you made a mistake .
one mistake .
do we have to get into this now ?
i did something like that today .
oh . okay .
look , i have something to ask , and , uh ,
you should probably take some time to think about it .
i don &apos;t need an answer tonight , but i @-@ i would like to know ...
if you &apos;ll come home .
you should get dressed now
