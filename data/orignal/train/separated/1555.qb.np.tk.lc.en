so , how long are you guys gonna be here for ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s not really up to me .
you &apos;re not jealous , are you ?
of callie ? no .
i don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
&apos;cause of mariana ?
do you honestly think that she &apos;s gonna care ?
i know she is . she told me .
so that &apos;s it . we &apos;re just gonna do whatever mariana wants ?
i want everyone
write about guilt in their journals .
don &apos;t worry . no one &apos;s gonna read it .
it &apos;s just for you to get in the habit of writing every day .
she read my journal .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you wrote about liam ?
i have to write a story ,
and i need a name for the bad guy .
how about liam ?
whoa , leave yourself some room to breathe , sweetheart .
come on , i don &apos;t need to breathe .
yes , you do .
do you think the top is too ...
busty ?
boring ?
right ?
you should jewel it .
ah , si .
uh , does that cost more ?
un poco .
un poco .
por favor , mama ?
gosh , ok .
como ?
she &apos;s asking if your father &apos;s tie is going to match
with your dress for the father @-@ daughter dance .
ah , que bueno .
uh , so you can dance with a padrino or ...
a close friend de la familia .
she &apos;s dancing with her moms . right ?
hey ! sorry , i &apos;m late !
hi , sweetie .
so , oh my goodness , you look beautiful , sweetheart !
did you see her face when stef walked up in her uniform ?
hilarious .
i hate when people say &quot; bueno , &quot;
like you need their approval for something .
when you tell people that you have a mom and dad ,
they don &apos;t say , &quot; how wonderful . &quot;
who cares ?
i wish i had two moms throwing me a quinceanera .
my parents refuse and we &apos;re latino .
i mean , so are you , but you know what i mean .
yeah , totally .
i just want this to be like , the party that
everybody talks about for the whole rest of high school .
you know what you need ...
three hundred dollars ?
shh .
for a dress she &apos;s only going to wear once ?
we &apos;ll cut it short and she can wear it to prom .
we &apos;re spending a fortune on this party .
it &apos;s not just a party ,
and we already set this money aside .
yes , before we had two more mouths to feed .
love , i &apos;m just asking can we just rein it in , please ?
did you talk to her about the kelsey situation ?
yes , i did .
and how did that go ?
so , lexi and i were talking ...
can we get a bubble machine for the party ?
no .
sure .
sure .
yes .
第一季第四集

hey , can talya stay for dinner ?
ooh , lexi , too ?

hey callie , how was your day ?
uh , it was good .
uh , so callie , you know my friend kelsey ?
oh , the one who lied and said i sold her drugs ?
yeah , well she &apos;s in rehab .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
so , do you want to take her place in my court ?
i think that is a great idea , mariana .
um , what do you think , callie ?
uh , sure , i guess .
great .
we &apos;ll just have to hurry
and get your gown fitted before saturday .
i have to wear a gown ?
well , you don &apos;t have to do anything .
and we get to do a waltz .
it &apos;s going to be fun .
like eating glass .

brandon .
yeah , i mean , but ... you &apos;re my date .
well , duh .
hey , b ? hey .
yeah ?
everything ok with you and talya ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
i don &apos;t know , just ...
brandon , listen .
you know that , i &apos;m assuming that you know that ...
well , you know , foster siblings are not allowed to ...
hook up ? i don &apos;t know what you guys call it these days ?
there &apos;s nothing going on between callie and i.
callie and me .
yeah , ok .
it &apos;s just , when the twins got here you were nine .
right , and now i &apos;m a horny teenager .
yes .
mom , i have a girlfriend and i know the rules .
ok .
ok .
will you do me a favor and take these to your brother ?
tell him to please stop leaving his crap around the house .
crap is not a bad word .
it &apos;s not a nice word .
well , give me a word to say then .
how &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s fine .
yeah ?
she &apos;s taking a shuttle from the airport tomorrow .
well , that &apos;s good . that &apos;ll help us , right ?
yeah , what would help us is if she wasn &apos;t coming at all .
oh , my gosh .
i &apos;ll never understand why dana stresses you out so much .
she &apos;s nothing but lovely to me .
you &apos;re not her daughter .
speaking of daughters ,
i think ours might be feeling a little embarrassed .
about what ?
about dancing with us at her party .
did she say something to you ?
no .
well , stop projecting .
mariana &apos;s always been very proud of us , really .
she &apos;s fine .
should i have mariachi ?
that &apos;s traditional .
so is having a catholic mass and you &apos;re not doing that .
用面饼和葡萄酒表示耶稣的身体和血来祭祀天主
yeah , true .
what about the shoe ceremony ?
uh @-@ uh . no .
a doll thing ?
my mom &apos;s going to be here any minute .
i &apos;m going to go use the ladies &apos; room .
the ladies &apos; room ?
hey , so i know your moms
made you ask me to be in your party .
so , i can tell them i don &apos;t want to do it .
i don &apos;t know . whatever . if you don &apos;t want to .
no , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s if you don &apos;t want me to .
i don &apos;t mind .
you know , you don &apos;t have to .
no , i know i don &apos;t have to .
ok , well , it &apos;s up to you .
ok . well , then yeah .
but i don &apos;t know how to waltz .
well , neither do i.
a friend of our moms is teaching us .
cool .
cool .
i &apos;m in here .
hey !
you didn &apos;t lock the door ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i hate sneaking around like this .
but , it &apos;s kind of hot .
i mean it .
fine , let &apos;s tell her now .
not before her party .
after .
i shouldn &apos;t even be doing this .
yes , you should .
i have to go home .
i have to go home .
no , you do not .
go . go before mariana thinks i fell in .
i just wanted to say goodnight to you guys .
and jude , thank you so much
for helping out with dinner , you did a great job .
thanks .
night , mom .
hey you , jesus foster .
you &apos;re being a real sport about mariana &apos;s party , eh ?
you &apos;re a good brother .
it &apos;s ok . just as long as
i &apos;m the one who gets the car when we turn 16 .
yeah , that &apos;s going to happen .
yeah , what he said .
all right , goodnight you guys .
thanks for dinner .
yeah , of course .
what ?
nothing .
hey , where &apos;s callie ?
bathroom .
oh , those look fantastic , sweetheart . good job .
all right , goodnight , lovely .
mm . don &apos;t stay up late , ok ?
ok , goodnight , mom .
hey , listen , you know , mama said something to me ,
and i just wanted to check in with you .
you &apos;re not embarrassed to dance with us at your party , are you ?
that &apos;s a sad lunch ,
but i guess it beats prison food .
really ? that &apos;s your opening line ?
i was going to ask about your rap sheet ,
but i thought that was rude .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re supposed to laugh ,
and you realize that we &apos;re both outsiders who nobody gets .
and then you get my name tattooed on your neck ,
until it all goes terribly wrong ,
and you have to turn it into a snake
just biting your earlobe .
what do you want from me ?
what every guy wants .
stimulating conversation .
and sex . that &apos;s probably off the table , huh ?
look at that smile .
so , listen , some of us are hanging out at the beach
by the pier , saturday night , you should come .
i can &apos;t , i have a thing .
what kind of thing .
the kind that you &apos;d make fun of if i told you .
when your thing gets boring ...
you know where to find me .
don &apos;t be shy . place your right hand on your partner &apos;s waist .
and slightly around to the small of her back .
extend the left hand .
palm raised .
callie , rest your hand gently in his .
other hand , up on his shoulder like so .
a little closer .
good , hold that position .
in partner dancing , connection is key .
so , brandon and callie , look into each others eyes .
breathe .
connect . and you two .
and over here . right hand , on her waist .
left hand ...
everyone ? gram &apos;s here !
dana , you made it .
of course i made it .
good to see you .
oh , hello beautiful .
hi mom .
oh , your skin looks good .
you &apos;ve been moisturizing , but my god ,
you &apos;re pale . baby , you need some sun .
yeah , but she &apos;s gorgeous . look at her .
of course , she &apos;s gorgeous .
gram !
and there &apos;s my beautiful birthday girl .
oh , and my handsome birthday boy !
your grandfather &apos;s very sorry he couldn &apos;t be here ,
because he got stuck in paris at a conference .
i wish i was stuck in paris .
you play your cards right and i will take you one day .
where &apos;s my other dashing grandson ?
uh , practice .
well ... you must be callie .
and you must be jude .
yes , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s lovely to meet you both .
thanks .
everyone in this house calls me gram .
guess what , i &apos;ve got fabulous presents for your birthdays ...
gotta be out the door in 15 !
wow .
wow yourself .
mm , we should dress up for each other more often .
i know .
or you could check your email .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i just ...
everything &apos;s done , sweetheart . let it go .
i just want her party to be perfect .
she &apos;s going to be the center of attention .
for mariana , it don &apos;t get no better than that .
ok , you guys need another bathroom .
you look lovely , dana .
you really do , mom .
thank you . it &apos;s a miracle because no black woman
can tame the mane in 15 minutes .
luckily , you don &apos;t have that problem .
yeah , i don &apos;t exactly just wake up like this .
baby , that is a compliment .
ok , gift bags . enough .
it &apos;s good ... it &apos;s good like that .
well , you look handsome .
well , you too ... pretty , i mean .
oh , right , i think .
help me with the gift bags . bring &apos; em out to the car .
thanks .
uh , you need help ?
what ?
oh , uh ... no . i got it .
you look ... nice .
look at you , hottie .
well , i should take these to the car .
you look pretty .
you , too .
it really is nice for mariana to ask you to be in her court .
seeing as how , you know , this is a temporary situation .
well , you never know . i mean , they might decide to keep us .
maybe .
i mean , unless ...
what ?
they knew something .
something ?
like what happened with liam .
you make it a habit of reading other people &apos;s journals ?
just people i don &apos;t trust .
going to go help brandon .
what &apos;s going on ?
hey . you look nice .
oh , thank you . so do you .
that lena &apos;s one lucky lady , huh ?
ok .
so , listen ...
i wanted to give you this .
child support ? that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s for mariana . it &apos;s for the party .
look , i know this is costing you guys a fortune ,
and i asked around .
it &apos;s tradition for friends
and family to help out with these things .
it &apos;s very sweet , mike .
i ... i really do appreciate it , but we can &apos;t accept this .
i &apos;m not taking that .
if you don &apos;t take it , i &apos;m going to be deeply offended .
and you , of all people ,
should know you don &apos;t want me deeply offended .
well , thank you very much .
ok .
actually , mike , there is something that you could do for me .
um , i know it &apos;s last minute , but mariana has actually asked
if you would do the father @-@ daughter dance with her .
really ?
yeah .
seriously , me ?
yeah .
wow . yeah , of course . i &apos;d be honored .
ok .
i mean , you ok with that ?
yeah , well , apparently dancing with your two moms
is not exactly quince tradition , so ...
just roll with the punches .
what about lena ?
oh no , it &apos;s fine , really .
we want her to have the
party she wants and this is what she wants .
ok , well , she &apos;s lucky to have you two .
you &apos;re great moms .
that hurt to say , didn &apos;t it .
no , not at all . hey , look at you in your penguin suit .
huh ?
never mind .
if i &apos;m going to cut a rug with mariana ,
i &apos;m going to need a little liquid courage .
ok .
wait , mariana is dancing with mike ?
i thought she was dancing with you two .
it &apos;s fine , jesus .
will you please finish up this table for me ?
thanks , love .
ok .
you look like a princess .
i feel like i &apos;m going to throw up .
what if it &apos;s no fun ?
what if i trip and fall on my face ?
you won &apos;t , and it &apos;s going to be amazing .
what is that ?
your birthday present .
i wanted you to open it first .
help me open it .
oh , my god . did you do this all yourself ?
where did you get this picture ?
your moms .
i loved that dress !
she was new to our school
and she wore this princess dress every day for like a month .
i was obsessed with belle .
and one day she fell on the playground and ripped it .
and i burst into tears .
never mind the fact that her knee was all bloody .
it was humiliating . everybody laughed at me , except for lexi .
she helped me up and took me to the nurse &apos;s office .
you were my first friend .
and best friend .
thank you . i love you .
i love you .
can i interrupt ?
i &apos;m going to go get everybody together .
i &apos;ll see you out there .
me , too .
honey , you look beautiful .
thank you .
so , what &apos;s in the box ?
open it and see .
oh , my god , it &apos;s gorgeous .
every girl wears a tiara on her quinces .
oh god , it looks so expensive .
it was , don &apos;t tell mom .
thank you .
beautiful , beautiful .
she &apos;s my best friend .
so ?
so , i &apos;m not thinking about her feelings , i &apos;m being selfish .
what are you talking about right now ?
you &apos;re not being selfish . mariana &apos;s the selfish one .
my mom &apos;s just spending a bunch of money on this stupid party ,
she &apos;s not even dancing with them .
you know what else ? she &apos;s still in contact with our birth mom .
after i saved her ass .
we &apos;re not ending this .
don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
hi honey , did you find lexi ?
no .
you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
hey , have you seen lexi ?
no .
sorry , i was in the bathroom .
you &apos;re going to the bathroom a lot lately .
maybe you have a bladder infection .
mariana ?
here sweetie , on your left wrist .
ok , everybody , couple up .
the dj &apos;s going to announce the court ,
and then mariana and jesus , you &apos;ll make your grand entrance .
you all look wonderful , beautiful , handsome .
good luck . come on , talya .
ready ?
all right .
what are you doing ?
i think we should switch .
sam &apos;s too tall for lexi .
works for me .
ladies and gentlemen ,
welcome to mariana &apos;s quinceanera !
now , can i have everyone please rise
and give a warm welcome as you receive her court .
starting with lexi rivera and sam wilkins .
let &apos;s keep it going with callie jacob and brandon foster !
relax , this is your big moment .
and now , the moment we &apos;ve all been waiting for ,
ladies and gentlemen ,
mariana foster and her brother jesus foster .
but first we &apos;d like to kick things off
with the traditional padrino dance .
please welcome family friend , mike foster .
is mariana ok ?
she &apos;s fine .
hey , what was that about ? did i do something ?
you need to tell your girlfriend to chill .
why , what she &apos;d do ?
she thinks i have a thing for you .
what ... she said that ?
can you just tell her that she has nothing to worry about ?
please ?
very nice .
at this time , we &apos;d like to welcome
mariana &apos;s court to the dance floor
for the traditional viennese waltz .
all right , you &apos;re dancing with me . come on .
i know .
know what ?
about you and lexi .
dance .
we didn &apos;t want to tell you .
we didn &apos;t want to ruin your party .
well , you did .
ok , forget what i said about talya .
i &apos;m sorry .
you have nothing to be sorry about .
i don &apos;t get why it &apos;s such a big deal .
this doesn &apos;t change anything .
you could have any girl you wanted .
why &apos;d it have to be my best friend ?
can we have everyone back to the dance floor , please ?
what do you say , dana ? you want to get your groove on ?
why not .
come on .
oh , i don &apos;t know who should be more scared !
that &apos;s right .
oh no , do we have to ?
yes .
you guys are so great .
um , i &apos;m thirsty .
mariana .
i have nothing to say to you .
mariana , wait .
brandon .
brandon ? what is going on ?
don &apos;t play dumb with me .
callie told me what you did .
ok , i read her journal because ...
wait , wait . you read her journal ?
yes , and i &apos;m glad i did ...
i can &apos;t believe you .
there are things you that you don &apos;t ...
no . shut up !
just listen to ...
i can &apos;t do this anymore !
i &apos;m done .
please ...
fine , but ask her .
ask her about liam .
mariana .
can we talk ?
talk about what ?
how my best friend and brother lied to me ?
we didn &apos;t lie to you , we just didn &apos;t tell you .
same thing .
and you know what hurts the most ?
hearing all the awful things that jesus said about me .
and you didn &apos;t even defend me .
that &apos;s not what a best friend does .
yeah , i &apos;ll have another double . neat .
you got it .
hey , two white wines , please .
hope you &apos;re pacing yourself , mike .
it &apos;s a party , stef . have some fun .
this is a lovely party .
thanks .
i know money &apos;s been tough for you and stef ...
mom , we &apos;re fine .
i know you &apos;re fine ,
but with two more mouths to feed ,
this is a lot to spend on a birthday party .
well , it &apos;s not just a birthday party .
this is about mariana embracing her cultural heritage .
about being part of the latino community .
which , of course , she isn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just saying being that latina isn &apos;t
just about the color of her skin .
but being black is .
what ?
for you being black has always been about
the color of a person &apos;s skin .
that &apos;s not true .
yes , it is .
all i &apos;ve ever said is that dark skinned people ,
have a different experience than light skinned ones .
and by different , you mean more authentic .
i mean harder .
honey , dark skinned people face more discrimination .
that is just a fact of life .
so , maybe we are trying
to make up for what we couldn &apos;t give mariana .
but i understand how she feels .
do you now ?
you were raised by a black mother .
and by a white father .
and i never felt accepted by either community , mom .
well , i &apos;m so sorry if you had such a tough time
being a beautiful light skinned woman ...
oh , mom ...
but like it or not ,
the color of your skin has afforded you more
opportunities than anyone like me has ever had .
that is what you &apos;ve always assumed .
that being biracial has made my life easier .
because it has .
like it or not , you will never know what it is like
to be a black woman in america .
look at the bright side , now we can dance together .
i don &apos;t really feel like dancing .
i should go home . mariana doesn &apos;t want me here .
no , i want you here .
it &apos;s my birthday , too .
how did she find out ?
i don &apos;t know .
but look , she &apos;s not letting it ruin her party .
we shouldn &apos;t let it ruin ours .
what &apos;s that about ?
they have a thing for each other .
how do you know ?
i pay attention .
they &apos;re not going to keep us , you know .
what are you talking about ?
brandon .
ok , jude ? i &apos;m not stupid , ok ?
but sometimes you do stupid things .
excuse me . do you want to dance ?
go .
hey , i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
is one of those for me ?
is one going to be enough ?
there &apos;s not enough wine in this world .
this about your mom ?
she just told me
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be a black woman .
she &apos;s not right , you know that .
she &apos;s right about one thing ,
and that &apos;s why i wanted to have this party for mariana ,
and why i don &apos;t give a damn how much it costs ,
because i understand what that &apos;s like .
not knowing where you belong .
i felt like that my entire life .
you know where you belong .
i shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
this is mariana &apos;s party .
hey . hey . hey . listen to me .
this is her party but you can cry if you want to .
i love you .
can i have everyone &apos;s attention ?
can everyone please find their seat ?
and can i have stef and lena join us on the dance floor ?
mariana , your moms have something they &apos;d like to say to you .
ok , first of all , jesus , will you please come join your sister ?
ok , first we want to thank all of our friends and family
for coming to join us and celebrating this
very , very special birthday today . thank you .
our babies are 15 ! could you believe this ?
to our beloved jesus and mariana ,
you have brought so much joy and love to your moms ,
and to your brother brandon &apos;s life as well .
he begged us and begged us for a brother or a sister ,
and got both in one fell swoop .
um , we love you so very much ,
and since a picture is worth a thousand words ,
i &apos;m going to shut up and we &apos;re going to watch this .
so , go over there .
ok , and jesus ,
just so you don &apos;t think we forgot about you ...
happy birthday !
not in the house , young man .
thank you so much .
now , may i please have the rest of the family

honey , it &apos;s a beautiful party .
what happened to talya ?
she left .
are you ok ?
nope .
i broke up with talya .
because of me .
no , no , i ...
i mean , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what she thinks , but it &apos;s not .
i broke up with her because she &apos;s doing stupid things .
like reading your journal .
she told you .
she didn &apos;t tell me what it said .
i didn &apos;t want to hear it .
callie , i already know everything i need to know about you .
callie ? hey .
callie ? callie , wait .
hey ! brandon ?
you haven &apos;t said boo to your old man all night .
sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry .

i love you .
i love you , too .
i love you so much . look at you , hm ?
you &apos;re a man , now . you &apos;re all grown up .
i wish ...
what ?
i wish i could do it all over again .
dad .
ok , i know it &apos;s a party , so go have fun .
i &apos;m going to go home .
ah , i think i should drive you home .
i think you &apos;re right .
i am a police officer ,
and i have an example to set for
the fine people i protect and serve .
i &apos;m this way .
all right .
mariana ? some of your guests are starting to leave .
what &apos;s the matter ? aren &apos;t you having a good time ?
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
for being selfish .
honey , what are you talking about ?
this party .
it cost so much and you both worked so hard .
i didn &apos;t dance with you . i should &apos;ve danced with you .
i have the best moms in the world
and i should &apos;ve danced with you .
baby .
honey , it &apos;s ok .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what you need ?
a mama sandwich !
no !
yes ! mommy sandwich !
we love you .
i love you , too .
lexi , i &apos;m not letting you leave here
without dancing with me .
did i say it was formal ?
i just assumed .
you look dumb in that dress .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
do you want a beer ?
