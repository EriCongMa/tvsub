over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re doing this !
hell , yeah , we are !
this is crazy !
dude , you &apos;ll be fine . just keep running .
remember , you fall , don &apos;t try and get up .
curl into a fetal position , protect your head .
you do not want to be eye level with those horns .
they &apos;re singing for protection , asking the saints to keep us safe .
how cool is that ? all right , all right .
it &apos;s 2 minutes till 8 : 00 . lew here .
with clint and kev ,
getting set to test ourselves
against the mighty toros bravos of pamplona !
that we just found out run at 35 miles per hour .
kev thinks we should have gone to vegas .
but clint here wanted to celebrate his 40th
by cheating death itself .
come on , you love it !
this is it ! the bulls are loose !
if we get split up ,
let &apos;s regroup behind that cafe we had breakfast at ,
okay ? behind the cafe !
hell , yeah !
whoo ! what a rush !
ronaldo is the best player in the world right now .
i don &apos;t know . messi &apos;s a genius ,
and he &apos;s adorable .
athletes should not be described as adorable .
oh , well , i don &apos;t remember you being bothered
when somebody called you something similar
in the &quot; men of the fbi &quot; calendar .
that was for charity .
w @-@ wait a minute , when was this ?
that was last year . jack was mr. july .
no . - one word -- fireworks .
no .
duty calls .
let &apos;s get everyone up to speed , monty .
kaixo . okay , two days ago ,
clint smith , a lawyer from seattle ,
went missing in pamplona .
he had traveled to spain to take part in the running of the bulls
and disappeared shortly after his first bull run .
his friends , americans lew donovan
and kevin garcia reported him missing
when he failed to return after the race that morning .
then yesterday , clint smith &apos;s ears ,
and only his ears , were found severed
in vasconia plaza inside the old city .
why ears ?
could be symbolic .
maybe our unsub wants to be heard .
or maybe it &apos;s a scare tactic .
terrorist groups have been known to cut off ears , noses ,
and lips just to make a statement ,
you know , incite fear .
what about the rest of his body ?
it hasn &apos;t been found .
monty ran the m.o. through interpol and got a hit .
okay , this time last year ,
the ears of three australian citizens
were found scattered across pamplona .
all three had traveled to spain
to take part in the running of the bulls .
six months later , their partial remains
were found scattered outside of the city limits .
u.s. embassy wants us on the ground immediately .
is there any connection between the australian victims ?
none that local p.d. can tell .
they were taken every couple of days
in different locations and times ,
and their ears were left at three distinct landmarks .
didn &apos;t don quixote
have his ear cut off by a basque traveler ?
he was wounded after his battle
with the famous windmills of la mancha .
i saw the movie .
this says the ears were left at famous basque landmarks .
pamplona is part of the kingdom of navarre ,
land of the basques .
given the history , maybe our unsub
is trying to make a political statement ?
so , we need to determine whether these attacks are part
of a larger political agenda ,
or the work of a disturbed individual .
well , either way , if the pattern holds ,
the unsub will strike again , soon .
and with more americans in pamplona than ever before ,
it &apos;s our job to stop him before he does .
don &apos;t !
第一季第十二集
too much sanity may be madness ,
and the maddest of all ,
to see life as it is , and not as it should be .
miguel de cervantes .
there &apos;s something like a million people
that descend on pamplona during this week .
they run the bulls every day .
they have parades and bullfighting , fireworks .
hemingway described it as a &quot; furious energy . &quot;
an expression of the ephemeral .
life and the death and the fleeting moments in between .
benjamin esposito .
you must be agent garrett .
that &apos;s right .
welcome to pamplona .
thank you . this is my team .
agent seger . agent simmons .
and jarvis .
thanks for your cooperation .
i was the lead detective on the case last year ,
and i have been dreading this day ever since .
i knew a criminal this twisted would strike again .
they usually do , but if we can build a profile
in conjunction with the physical evidence ,
we have a good shot at catching him .
as you can imagine ,
an event like this is a huge boost
to the local economy .
because of this , my superiors
have asked to keep low profiles
so as not to cause any alarm .
por favor .
so , what can you tell us about
your initial investigation ?
well , the three sets of ears belonging
to the australian citizens
didn &apos;t leave us much to go on .
witnesses proved unreliable .
the case went cold .
this way .
and you found remains for each of the australians ?
yes . the bodies were dismembered
and found washed up in a ditch off the highway .
the ears of both the first australian victim
and american clint smith were dumped here
in the same spot in this courtyard , yeah ?
here , vasconia plaza .
that &apos;s home to an important basque memorial .
yes , basque nationalists
have a history of trying to co @-@ op the fiesta .
we have seen large @-@ scale demonstrations , intimidation ,
and on some occasions , violence .
much like the u.k. and the irish republican army ,
you &apos;ve been dealing with these issues for decades .
last year , there were whispers
that these attacks were part of a larger basque agenda ,
but no one is taking credit .
simmons , let &apos;s take advantage of
the extensive media coverage
and review the festival footage .
we need to find clint &apos;s last known location .
i &apos;ll talk to clint &apos;s friends , lew and kevin .
great . mae , take a look at the forensic evidence .
the ears . got it .
detective , we need to surveil
the two previous disposal sites .
it &apos;s likely the attacker or attackers will revisit .
we &apos;ve got officers monitoring the grounds .
i &apos;d like to view the memorial
where clint smith &apos;s ears were found .
i can take you there .
mijo ?
the ears were found right here .
were your men able to dust for prints ?
well , the festival brings a lot of additional foot traffic ,
so we &apos;ve had trouble pulling anything conclusive .
the day the ears were found ,
there was a lot of people everywhere .
the crowds were buying a sense of anonymity
that would allow the unsub to move around freely .
there was a riot in &apos; 78 that took place in this plaza .
a basque man was struck by the authorities ,
violence erupted .
they had to cancel the fiesta that year .
this memorial is a call for peace .
so , our killer knows his history .
maybe he feels his statements are falling on deaf ears .
if this is about politics ,
why attack turistas ?
maybe he blames them .
for what ?
distracting from the true meaning of san fermín .
at its heart , the festival
is a religious celebration , correct ?
yes . it is a way for us to honor and give thanks
to the patron son of pamplona , san fermin .
who found the ears ?
father consolmango . two days ago .
i am father consolmango .
father .
detective esposito said that you &apos;re the one
who found the remains .
yes .
a strange thing , this removal of the ears .
you have a pretty good view of the memorial .
what can you recall about the moments leading up
to your discovery ?
it was morning .
i went outside and spotted them in the --
in the plaza .
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious
in the last few days ?
i have heard of many bad deeds
done in these late days .
but i have not witnessed anything myself .
detective esposito and i are trying to stop a killer
and save the life of an innocent man .
if you know something ,
you &apos;d be serving the cause of justice .
i &apos;m sorry .
i cannot be of more help .
excuse me .
i have a mass to prepare for .
buenos días .
gracias .
he knows something he isn &apos;t saying .
the father made it clear . he didn &apos;t see anything .
he said he &apos;s heard of many bad deeds ,
maybe in confidence or via confession .
that is a sacred boundary .
i mean , how often do you think killers confess to their priests ?
if our unsub did confess ,
it would say something about him .
that he feels guilty ?
this is españa , a catholic country .
guilt is a way of life .
yes , but for a violent offender like this ,
it &apos;s a contradiction , one we need to understand .
father consolmango would never violate his oath ,
and he &apos;s under no obligation to do it ,
so we need to pursue other lines of inquiry .
the spanish should be ashamed of themselves , man .
all this talk of this festival honoring the bulls is bull .
these people are just concerned with how much money they &apos;re gonna make .
it &apos;s so commercialized .
get some &quot; b &quot; roll . i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
well , it looks like they were sliced cleanly , one cut .
lack of hesitancy speaks to our killer &apos;s resolve .
do you have the report on the ears that we found last year ?
we have the ears .
oh , great . can i take a look ?
based on the cut itself , i would venture to say
that these were done with a small , curved blade
like a hunting knife or a paring knife .
that is what we thought , as well .
let &apos;s see if these stick in the pattern .
so , how long have you been working here ?
i &apos;ve been producing a local television coverage
for almost a decade now .
i have to say that the running of the bulls has to be
one of the most photographed spectacles in the world .
it &apos;s a great advertisement for the city itself .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure espn rolls tape
on a guy getting gored almost every year .
san fermin is to spain
what mardi gras is to your new orleans .
a never @-@ ending party fueled by equal parts adrenaline
and sangria .
i pulled up some locations
based on the information you provided .
yeah , this looks like the spot .
can you blow it up ?
this is the san francis xavier cathedral and fountain .
stupid guiri should know better than to urinate on a church .
that &apos;s clint . freeze it there .
he &apos;s got a lot of nerve to do something like that .
can you get me a screen grab on that ?
yes , of course .
i think i may have something .
so , we know our australian victims have little in common
with each other , and even less in common with clint ?
so , it got me thinking ,
what if our victims were chosen not because of who they are ,
but because of something they did ?
maybe without even realizing it .
clint relieved himself in the fountain
of a very famous cathedral .
pretty easy to see how that could upset someone .
there &apos;s no shortage of bad behavior around here .
to the locals , it must be infuriating .
if clint was attacked because if he offended someone ,
maybe our previous victims caused offense , as well .
but would that make them the target
of basque nationalists ?
not likely .
plus , if this is the work of a political group ,
someone would have came forward , taken credit by now .
you &apos;re right . this isn &apos;t political .
these people are being punished .
victimology here is key .
simmons , see if you can get access
to the festival &apos;s video archives .
i &apos;ll have monty run the australian vics
through his fancy program .
if the act of offense is the unsub &apos;s trigger ,
do we think their transgressions would be the same as clint &apos;s ?
we need to look for patterns .
excuse me .
and we need to see if clint or any of the previous victims
have crossed paths with any of the same locals .
his friends couldn &apos;t give me any details ,
so it &apos;s worth a look .
yeah , i &apos;ll get monty up to speed .
with so little evidence ,
we need to reduce the potential victim pool .
yes , this is irt unit chief jack garrett .
i need you to connect me with the american ambassador
in madrid .
state department &apos;s not gonna be happy .
nor detective esposito ,
but we need to issue a travel alert
to all americans in the area .
charles , we have a situation .
detective esposito says that his men didn &apos;t see anything .
they responded to the screams
when a couple of tourists noticed the ears .
this way .
thank you .
now he &apos;s taken a second victim .
well , he sure knows how to blend in .
cops nearby , clergy .
he &apos;s taking a risk being here .
yeah , it speaks his compulsion .
okay , so unlike before ,
when our unsub displayed the australian &apos;s ears
just down the street near city hall ,
these were left right
in the inside of san fermin cathedral .
i got to say , dropping ears
at the doorstep of the patron saint
feels pretty darn symbolic .
no kidding , but is it an offering
or a form of defiance ?
the way that they &apos;re presented like this , out in the open ,
it makes me think it &apos;s the latter .
it &apos;s certainly a bold statement .
based on the angle of excision on the edges ,
i can say that our unsub definitely used the same knife .
so , according to our theory , do we think
this victim also defamed the church in some way ?
maybe he offended good old saint fermín himself ?
or maybe our unsub has appointed himself
the new patron saint of pamplona ,
and these are just a form of consecration ?
when i asked you to keep this quiet ,
issuing a travel warning to all visiting americans
was not exactly what i had in mind .
we have to get ahead of this guy .
it &apos;s imperative that we warn the public ,
and i &apos;d like to pay another visit
to father consolmango -- he knows something .
he wasn &apos;t forthcoming with us earlier .
father consolmango has been
a pillar of this community for over 30 years .
señor garrett , you must understand
the politics involved .
if i reach out to the archdiocese
with such a request , they will deny it .
they want nothing to do with our investigation .
we need to know what he knows .
i have already been reprimanded by my superiors
for bringing you to question him .
they gave me an ultimatum .
i have to make progress ,
or i am off the case , and you with me .
this is the last we speak of this .
detective . i &apos;d like to give you
our preliminary profile on the killer .
my team has made progress .
let &apos;s break down what we &apos;ve got so far .
so , we know because of the size and the age of the victims
that we &apos;re looking for a physically fit male
local to the greater pamplona area .
and in flaunting the ears inside the san fermín cathedral
it is a direct challenge to the church .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s -- anointing himself god .
the ultimate arbiter of life and death for his victims .
a pretty extreme form of narcissism .
yeah , which means he &apos;ll be outspoken
and very aggressive in his beliefs .
now , as far as why he has chosen to express his rage in this way ,
by cutting off the ears , it could be a scare tactic .
like the cartels in mexico .
the more extreme the mutilation ,
the more terrifying the message .
in this case , &quot; get off my lawn . &quot;
we found that with offenders like this ,
their anger is rooted in a past conflict or trauma .
although our research has yet to turn anything up .
you want to expand our parameters ?
i &apos;ll make a few calls , see if we can get access
to the records of the regional police ,
the ertzaintza &apos;s , as well as the national police .
good .
jack .
monty &apos;s got something for us .
you told me to look for patterns .
now , the thing about looking for patterns
is you start to see them everywhere ,
even in places you don &apos;t expect .
using facial recognition ,
i was ble to track two of our three australian victims so far .
our first australian victim
took a selfie while on the course .
festival organizers banned the use of cell phones .
a few years ago , a man did this and got himself gored .
our second australian victim
hit the bull with a rolled @-@ up newspaper .
what &apos;s the big deal ? he just reached out
and tried to tap the bull . isn &apos;t that what you do ?
the rolled @-@ up newspaper is supposed
to be unfurled to distract the bull
from striking you if you get too close .
swatting at the bull is dangerous .
distracting the animal by so much
as touching it could steer it off course .
separate it from the herd .
and bulls separated from the herd
are far more liable to attack .
in running , you &apos;re joining the herd
for its final moments of freedom .
it &apos;s a sacred thing .
so , each of our victims
dishonored the sanctity of the run .
not just that , the bulls themselves .
clint &apos;s goal was to run on the horns ,
but what do you want to bet
he also got a little too close and personal ?
well , let &apos;s see .
he tried to touch the bull .
this has nothing to do with religion .
this is about our victim &apos;s actions
toward the animals themselves .
they disrespected the bull .
do you think our unsub was on the course ?
or he could have been in the plaza .
photo booths post pictures of the day &apos;s run almost
frame by frame so people can find themselves .
according to these police reports ,
i got a guy who keeps popping up in the same places
as our australian vics , carlos villa .
carlos villa , animal rights activist .
he was arrested three years ago in madrid
for trespassing after he tried to sabotage a bullfight .
this guy has been arrested 13 times since 2007 .
all the charges were regarding animal cruelty ?
yes , there is currently a warrant out on him
for aggravated assault .
do we know if he &apos;s crossed paths with each of our victims ?
that &apos;s a good bet , indirectly if not directly .
and he arrived in pamplona the night
before clint went missing .
he &apos;s got an axe to grind regarding
the mistreatment of the bulls .
where is he now ?
according to his twitter feed ,
at a protest in the city square .
jack and mae are closer .
hey ! come on .
carlos , i am not hearing a lot of empathy
for the loss of life .
empathy ?
most of the people that come here don &apos;t even know
that the same bulls run through the street
in the morning are slaughtered that night !
over 7,000 bulls were killed in bullfights in spain last year .
all right , so why &apos;d you run ?
there &apos;s a warrant out on me for a trumped @-@ up charge .
it was a cosmetics testing facility
that routinely abused the animals in its care .
they didn &apos;t like when i took pictures .
but i never cut anyone &apos;s ears off before
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
you ever seen this man ?
no .
mr. villa , this is a murder investigation .
three men are dead and two are missing .
did you know that , on special occasions ,
matadors cut the ears and tails off their vanquished bulls
as trophies ?
you see , the matador and his assistant work together
to weaken the animal ,
and in a show of dominance , slice its ears off .
the bull dies .
coughing up its own blood , too debilitated to even move .
and in a final act of impudence ,
the matador hurls the animal &apos;s ears into the crowd
so they can be trampled on .
and it &apos;s man that deserves my sympathy ?
monty , tell us something good .
okay , i got the idea on the second set of ears .
they belong to tony downs ,
a 32 @-@ year @-@ old animal rights activist from chicago .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would one activist kill another activist ?
he didn &apos;t .
we just confirmed carlos &apos; alibi .
he was at the hospital
having his arm treated at the time clint disappeared .
he &apos;s not our guy .
hey . carlos &apos; alibi checks out .
these attacks aren &apos;t about sending a message
or making a statement .
they &apos;re about establishing dominance .
in keep the bodies and discarding
the victim &apos;s ears , our killer is emulating the matador .
in spain , bullfighting isn &apos;t a sport .
matadors , capes , costumes --
it &apos;s as much symbolic as it is theatrical .
it is performance art that ends in a ritual sacrifice .
a tragedy told in three acts .
just like our unsub .
three victims , three deaths , three disposal sites .
this isn &apos;t someone who sees man as inferior ,
but the bulls as superior .
detective , what &apos;s the significance of the three stages ?
in the first terico ,
called the third of lances , the matador observes the bull .
he tests him , revealing his character .
the second stage , called the third of flags ,
is when the matador &apos;s assistants ,
his cuadrilla , put their stakes in the animal to weaken him ,
but also to anger him .
and the final stage --
third of death .
exactly .
this is when the matador uses his puntilla
to slay the animal in a final demonstration of supremacy .
puntilla ?
it is a small , curved knife
that severs the bull &apos;s spinal cord .
that sounds like the weapon our unsub &apos;s
using to remove the ears .
so like our unsub ,
the matador stalks them , tortures them , and kills them .
you think we &apos;re looking for a torero ? a matador ?
or someone who thinks of themselves as one .
like a torero , someone who respects the animal as an equal ,
or the opponent .
let &apos;s cross @-@ reference former and current matadors
with criminal records that fit the profile .
the festival employees are almost completely accounted for ,
and we have confirmed the alibis
for all the matadors currently in pamplona .
jack ?
our unsub has a very narrow comfort zone ,
yet the crowds all but guarantee
he is not holding his victims here .
yeah , but he needs time to torture them ,
so he &apos;s holding them somewhere .
yeah , we know he &apos;s mobile .
and he &apos;s sophisticated ,
so he &apos;d know better than to hold two adult males at one time .
so , what is he doing with the bodies ?
let &apos;s say he &apos;s keeping the vics .
he &apos;d need a place that &apos;s secure and private .
probably outside of the city .
like a ranch ? a warehouse ?
there &apos;s less than a dozen ranches
that provide bulls to the festival , right ?
historically , yes .
but today , there must be more than 30 breeders
spread across the country .
there &apos;s no one that has more respect
or a more vested interest
in the well @-@ being of the bulls than the breeders .
or the people they employ .
perdón , señor .
sí .
robert tanida .
a third american citizen ,
robert tanida , has been reported missing .
third victim , just like the australians .
detective esposito , can you assist my agents
in finding out what the family knows ,
and quickly ?
yes .
if our unsub has his third and final victim ,
this is our last chance to catch him .
i &apos;m gonna follow up with something .
i &apos;ll be back soon .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
it &apos;s been two weeks since my last confession .
and are you here now to confess ?
no .
i believe you have information that can help my investigation .
i had a feeling you would return .
you are a dutiful agent , mr. garrett .
and a man of faith .
a catholic .
you would have me disobey canon law
and divulge information
i learned in this sacred space that we are now in ?
i understand the position i &apos;m putting you in .
you want me to defy my covenant with god ,
one that you believe in !
do you know who &apos;s responsible for these crimes ?
mr. garrett , please .
innocent men are dying . their killer might go free .
what you are asking of me is not possible !
this killer deserves to answer for his crimes here and now .
surely there is a moral imperative
that you can &apos;t ignore .
father , i mean no offense .
i can imagine the burden that you must feel .
see , i &apos;ve lived with my life as you have ,
serving a cause greater than myself ,
and i , too , took an oath .
clint smith .
tony downs .
robert tanida .
there &apos;s still time to save their lives .
we &apos;ll find another way .
thank you for your time .
&quot; god opposes the proud .
but shows favor to the humble . &quot;
do you know this proverb ?
peter is trying to remind us
that it is not our place to know all things .
it is a passage i return to often .
if only to humble myself before our father .
i pray that you catch this man .
and put him away .
peace be with you , mr. garrett .
and also with you , father .
let me guess . he wasn &apos;t forthcoming .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s a good man in an impossible situation .
what did he say ?
&quot; god opposes the proud , but shows favor to the humble . &quot;
proverbs .
it &apos;s also mentioned
in the book of peter to the shepherds
to be faithful servants to their flock ,
to watch over those entrusted to their care .
is the verse significant ?
maybe not in content , but context .
monty . i want you to do a search .
sure thing , what &apos;s going on ?
father consolmango said what he could ,
and what he gave me was 1 peter 5 : 5 .
could be an address .
part of a phone number .
date of birth .
okay , there are 360,000 people born every day .
in pamplona , i have thousands of boys born on may 5th ,
including lots and lots of pedros .
what about simon ?
peter was born simon , son of john .
before christ anointed him as one of his disciples .
ka @-@ ching , simon alonso ,
born may 5 , 1983,
西蒙 · 阿隆索
christened by father consolmango ,
the only son of xavi and delores alonso .
he ended up working at foto navarre ,
a photo booth in the old city a couple years back .
that &apos;s where they post the photos of the day &apos;s runs .
he could have seen each one of our victims from there .
address is on its way to you now .
help me !
three years ago ,
a global advocacy group headed
by american and australian animal rights activists
snuck onto the alonso &apos;s ranch
and freed their prized bulls .
now , in the resulting chaos , two people were gored to death ,
including one of the activists .
because of this , the family &apos;s bulls were slaughtered .
why are we just finding out about this now ?
the alonso breed is a very respected ,
ancient bloodline .
now , they &apos;re a prominent family ,
so they successfully lobbied to keep the incident quiet .
not to mention , the story was eclipsed
by a factory fire that killed 100 people the next day .
the destruction of the family &apos;s herd
could have been the cause of our unsub &apos;s stressor .
yeah , the loss of a family business .
their social standing could have sent our unsub into a tailspin .
excuse me , have you seen this man ?
no .
no .
no , no .
excuse me .
thank you .
jack !
where is he holding his victims ?
he says they &apos;re dead .
all the victims are dead .
every man fan out , cordon off this area .
treat this as an active crime scene .
he said he couldn &apos;t protect his family .
i don &apos;t know .
ramblings of a madman .
who we &apos;ll now put behind bars
thanks to you and your team .
my men will find out what he &apos;s done with the bodies .
gracias , agent garrett .
great work .
jack ? what is it ?
all the physical evidence says we got our guy ,
but something &apos;s bothering me .
we profiled this unsub as a matador --
dominant , statement @-@ driven .
the guy we just arrested isn &apos;t either .
he did lack the confidence
you &apos;d expect from such an offender .
but he expressed guilt . he confessed to the priest .
yeah , but we did say he &apos;d need a place
that was secluded to hold his victims while he tortured them ,
which that place definitely wasn &apos;t .
what if we &apos;re looking for a team ,
with dominant to our submissive ?
esposito , he said that matadors have assistants ,
people who work to weaken the bull before the final kill .
yeah , but we were correct about the profile .
we were right about the stressor , it led us to simon .
which means we &apos;re looking for someone with a shared trauma .
someone with significant influence over simon .
they say that bullfighting is a family business .
hey , monty ,
what happened to the rest of the alonso family ?
the alonsos are no longer in pamplona , a far as i can tell .
delores alonso passed away a year ago ,
but simon &apos;s father is completely off the grid ,
although someone is still paying the mortgage
on an abandoned property the family owns ,
the alonso bullfighting ring .
that &apos;s it , the father .
monty , get us everything you can
on the patriarch of the alonso family .
please ...
simon and his father were outcasts .
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if they developed a siege mentality .
keep your eyes open .
please , let me go .
wait , wait , wait .
stand back .
simmons .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s feeding his victims to the bulls .
got you now , huh ?
drop your weapon !
bulls were kings !
they lived ! they were gods !
you don &apos;t have to do this . this man is innocent .
foreign bastards .
my bulls defined san fermín !
my family no deserve this .
no !
we need to get an ambulance here immediately .
it &apos;s okay .
father .
you caught the man responsible ?
father , in my line of work ,
i see the worst humanity has to offer .
chaos and death ,
it can be hard to remember the good .
sometimes it &apos;s tough to have faith in people , in institutions .
in god .
you feel called to intervene in the face of injustice .
that in and of itself is an act of faith .
a good shepherd always looks out for his flock .
the book of &quot; amos &quot; tells us ,
&quot; let justice roll on like a river . &quot;
&quot; and righteousness like a never @-@ falling stream . &quot;
amen .
thank you , father .
