art teachers don &apos;t have a desk .
they just throw their purse anywhere .
voodoo spell , voodoo spell ,
seagull beak and bone of mel ,
purple heart and tear of chum ...
just had to be tear of chum .
send her home with aching tum !

where &apos;s mrs. trunch ?
i need to know the correct density of &quot; points &quot;
in my pointillism .
mm , sorry , but i don &apos;t think
we &apos;ll be seeing much of trunch today .
yep , i cast a voodoo spell on her .
i won &apos;t bore you with the dark details ,
but let &apos;s just say she &apos;s in no condition for teaching .

typical ralph nonsense .
bart simpson got a teacher pregnant !
you happy with your two @-@ timing boyfriend now ?
i admit , i did make a voodoo doll of mrs. trunch .
but i just asked for a stomachache , not a baby !
classic wish @-@ maker &apos;s mistake : vague language .
so i did make her pregnant ?
of course not . doesn &apos;t work that way .
just how do women get babies ?
i &apos;m not allowed to discuss that with fourth @-@ graders .
fifth grade , you get every dirty detail .
do you know how embarrassed i was
to get a call at my arraignment
for my behavior during the pub crawl
because of a voodoo curse
my son placed on his art teacher ?
i didn &apos;t mean to make her pregnant .
i just hate art so much .
oh , everyone does , son .
that &apos;s why they lock it up in museums
where no one will ever visit .
so , uh , your boy &apos;s got magic knock @-@ up powers , huh ?
hey , i created three kids ,
and no one &apos;s making a big deal of that .
not true ! whenever i compliment your virility ,
you act all weird .
and you are very virile .
uh , yeah . just talk about sports !
no problem .
wish i had that tom brady &apos;s libido .
oh , it &apos;s amazing how many cheerios maggie drops in the back seat .
here you go . put those in the trash ,
then you can help me unload the dishwasher .
oh ! a minute of fun , a lifetime of work .
i &apos;ve never heard of a pregnancy like this .
there he is .
jenny , this is crazy .
nothing &apos;s crazy at this point .
are you the boy that makes babies ?
i like to think i &apos;m the boy that makes families .
you see , jenny ? he &apos;s just a jerk kid .
it &apos;s just ...
we &apos;ve been trying so hard to start a family .
with all the money we &apos;ve spent on ivf ....
you have no idea !
hmm , maybe i can help .
but it &apos;ll cost you .
how much ?
five dollars .
plus one dollar haw @-@ haw insurance .

by the power of this place ,
make a baby with a face .
that &apos;s great , really .
really glad we &apos;re getting a baby with a face . thank you .
no haw @-@ haw ! it worked !
i &apos;m pregnant !

i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s a connection here .

i &apos;ll teach you to answer peoples &apos; prayers !
yeah , you know , i just don &apos;t think
we &apos;re going to get in to see him today .
what is your problem , boy ?
maybe when i &apos;ve got a dad who shows up in the morning
with no shirt on and rocks on his face ,
it sets , i don &apos;t know , a low bar ?
wow , i got to take that in .
while i do , have some bar nuts .
aren &apos;t those full of germs ?
eat the nuts ! they &apos;re your dinner !
you guys are coming with us .
not so fast !
nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers .
aw , thanks , moe , i ...
i must &apos;ve left my wallet at home .
all right , take them , take them !
fill their pockets with corn
and toss them to the pigs .
don &apos;t tell us our business !
huh ? fat tony ?
that &apos;s right ...
fat homer . hey !
i need your boy to make a baby .
do you really need the boy &apos;s help to make a baby ?
just do a little of the bunga @-@ bunga ,
and the hotsie @-@ totsie ,
and the bop @-@ bada- bop @-@ bada @-@ bop .
you sound like every doctor i &apos;ve ever been to .
but it &apos;s not for me .

the love of my life .
who has apple breath ?
you has apple breath .

who i have briefly &quot; borrowed , &quot;
is the winner of last year &apos;s springfield stakes--
rear admiral .
so work your magic , and breed me a champion .
look , fat tony ,
i don &apos;t know what you know about voodoo ,
but it only works on people .
horses ?
that &apos;s crazy talk !
you will breed me a champion by morning
or it will be the last sunrise you ever see .
don &apos;t over @-@ promise , boss .
it might be overcast .
how &apos;d you like a cast over your face ?
well , as long as there &apos;re breath holes .
you know , i &apos;m just saying .
okay , boy , if there ever was
a good time for you to find out
where babies come from
in the grossest way possible ,
with your life on the line ,
this is it .
one more thing :
it better be a boy .
anything else ?
it would be helpful if he could go undercover
with police horses and find out what they know .
hey , this is all your fault .
how is it my fault ?
i wouldn &apos;t be here if you were more of a role model .
pub crawls , naked frisbee golf ...
i just did that because it was a series of funny words .
well , it &apos;s your mediocre fathering
that put me on the path to hell !
maybe you &apos;re right , boy .
it &apos;s time i was a better father .
and i &apos;ll start by saving us .
i just need to facilitate
some horse intercourse .
come on , buddy .
just make a champion thoroughbred , and we &apos;re out of here .
