Cary asked me.
I know.
He's just on a call.
So, the IRA agreed to an Off and Compromise,
on your tax case.
The IRA?
The... the IRS.
You'll have to pay a penalty,
we can deal with all the specifics later,
but you have some un-cashed checks in your file.
You should take a look at those.
Thanks.
I'm not gay.
You asked whether I was gay?
Yes...
two years ago.
I know.
I wanted to answer.
I'm not gay, I'm...
...flexible.
Okay.
Flexible. Good.
And, uh...
Lana Delaney, this FBI agent,
that's... flexible?
Yeah. Sort of.
Because as your lawyer, I wouldn't...
you know what, it's your life. You do what you want.
What?
It's the Veriscene case. The judgment's in.
We find out tomorrow.
That's good.
I don't know. I've got a bad feeling about this one.
How's everyone this morning?
Well, Your Honor.
We seem to have a designated hitter here today.
Yes, Your Honor. My partner, Will Gardner,
couldn't be in court...
Oh, you don't have to cover for him. I know Will's suspended.
How's he doing?
Very well, thank you for asking.
Like a kid with five days until Christmas.
Well, tell him he's missed.
Shall we get started?
Plaintiff alleges that Veriscene,
a drug administered for the cure of acne
caused Mr. Goode irreversible sterility.
Accordingly, I am entering judgment for the plaintiff,
in the amount of $25 million in compensatory.
I acknowledge that this amount
is in excess of the $18 million requested by the plaintiff,
but I find the actions here particularly heinous.
Your Honor...
Yes, Mr. Canning?
You want to appeal?
Oh, I do. Uhvehemently.
As is your right.
Mr. Goode, no matter where this ends up, I want you to know,
justice was done here today.
Whoo-hoo! Yes!
Congratulations.
I am rarely speechless, but I am speechless.
Thank you. Thank you both.
It's not over yet.
They're going to drag this out in appeals, so...
I thought it was going against us.
Sometimes fate smiles.
Will, are you standing or sitting?
Which one do you want me to be?
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Do you know what this means?
That we can pay off our balloon payment.
And dodge the executioner for another quarter.
If you get a settlement.
Where's Canning at? He'll appeal.
For effect. $25 million should motivate him.
Peter, you okay?
We have a problem with the house.
We?
Uh, Jackie.
She paid ten percent in cash on the down payment.
Apparently, she was bidding against someone.
Me. She was bidding against me.
So I'm planning on going ahead with the purchase
and then flipping the house in a few months.
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think I could get more money for the house
if I did some work in the backyard.
Why are you telling me this, Peter?
Look, I don't want you to worry about these...
decisions.
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way,
but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood.
Okay. I won't.
So... we're making this work, right?
Oddly, yes, we are.
I heard Cary is back with you guys.
Yes, starts today.
He's a good guy.
Wish him luck.
So, we'll need you out here until we get an office cleared out,
if you're all right with that.
I am.
Good. It'll just be a few weeks.
Welcome back, Cary.
Yeah?
Um, is this F&E Construction?
Hello?
Who is this?
Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check
from F&E Construction.
Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check.
Who is this?
Um... is this F&E Construction?
Yes.
I don't recognize your voice.
I'm a lawyer representing...
someone...
uh, who has an un-cashed check from F&E Construction,
and she can't access her funds,
unless you reissue, so...
Who's the check make out to?
Cash.
Where are you calling from, lady?
Can you just reissue the check, sir?
Sure. Give me a check number.
You know what, um, I'll call you back with that information.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, Cary.
How are you doing?
Good.
You seem to be, too.
Oh, it's just from being liaison to Eli Gold.
As soon as he's back on the campaign trail,
I'll be out there with everyone else. Where are you?
I'm out there with everyone else.
Well, then you'll have company.
Canning. Oh, Cary.
Good to have you back.
Thank you.
The Veriscene case-- we're in the middle of negotiations.
Yeah, go for it. I know my way around.
We're not committing to an offer yet,
but if you have a number, we'll listen.
Mr. Canning, are you with us?
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just texting my lawyer.
It's funny, isn't it, lawyers having lawyers?
And my lawyer probably has a lawyer, too.
We should all be getting progressively smaller, like matryoshka dolls.
Yes. So are we negotiating, or what are we doing?
No, we're negotiating.
I-I think I have an offer for you.
A one-time offer.
Zero? Really?
you have five minutes to decide whether to take it.
I see. And if we don't,
you have a bomb or something?
Sort of.
Hi. We're all here. Where are you?
Just changing. I'll be right in.
The rashs back, Michael.
I know. I'm trying the ointment three times a day.
You have to stop eating so much spicy food.
Yes. No more Thai food for you.
Oh, please, it's just poop.
You shovel the stuff all day, buddy.
Oh, God.
Patti Nyholm.
Well, look at you.
And you.
Poster child for Motherhood Today.
You have no changing tables in the restroom, Will.
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
Yep, doing our part to suppress the birth rate.
So, I need some legal advice on my contract.
Oh, my God, wait.
You can't practice law anymore.
What was I thinking?
No, thank you.
I'll be right out, Michael.
This'll take a few minutes.
That must be reall hard on you, Will,
just sitting around watching all these lawyers
while you're, what, surfing the Web?
Clipping coupons?
What's up, Patti?
A lawsuit.
Really? Which one?
A new one. It'll be great being on opposite sides again,
dusting it up...
Oh, wait. Darn it.
You're not a lawyer anymore.
I keep forgetting.
So sorry I'm late.
Here's my lawyer now.
Ms. Nyholm, I believe you know everybody.
I think I do. Hello.
How are your negotiations going?
Well, I don't know,
I gave them five minutes to agree to my settlement offer,
and that time is up... now.
We're suing you.
On behalf of LOC Pharmaceuticals, makers of Veriscene and Elvatyl.
And their insurer, LifeState.
We joined forces to sue you for $50 million
for fraud and malicious prosecution.
Come on, this is harassment.
Is that you legal opinion, Will?
No, it's mine.
Your company doesn't like being sued,
try making products that don't kill and maim people.
Here's a better idea--
stop intentionally and wrongfully instituting legal proceedings
you know are without merit.
We were just awarded $25 million,
I'd call that merit.
No. I would call that judicial bbery.
Oops.
Is that a sensitive topic?
This case was built for a jury.
You requested a bench trial.
It's a million-dollar case,
and your basketball buddy awarded you $25 million.
I was cleared by a grand jury.
No.
You weren't indicted by a grand jury.
You gamed the system; I know you, Will.
You can't do that with me.
Or with me.
That's right. We're the dream team.
Jackie?
Mr. Gold?
Hi.
Peter said you were here.
Shouldn't you be in synague?
Uh... no.
How are you feeling?
Better.
Good.
Then I won't feel bad about saying this.
Your son is going to lose.
Without Alicia, he will lose the governorship.
Uh, I-I don't know...
She was on our side,Jackie.
Alicia was offering to help Peter, then you got involved.
How did I get involved?
This friggin' house!
My God, I've never heard
so much real estate talk in all my life.
If their separation goes wide, everything collapses.
Eli, what do you want?
I want you to apologize to her.
Your son will not win without Alicia,
and I will not manage this campain without her.
So say, "I'm sorry" even if you don't believe it.
I dreamt I died.
Everybody just did what they always did.
They didn't care.
Um, do you want me to get you a nurse or some.
Are you religious?
Am I, um... I...
I thought Jews believed in God.
Yes, we all do; Every one of us.
I don't want to die.
I'll get you a nurse.
I don't want to die.
It's a scare tactic.
Look at Ketter Sum Holdings.
They sued the lawyers bringing class actions
against their artificial knees in order to scare them off.
There might be more.
I think Patti is using this suit to fact-find.
For an appeal?
Yes.
Look who they're deposing.
Kalinda, me.
Patti doesn't have enough,
so she's using this suit t
o find out if we did anything wrong.
I wish I could agree, but if the law taught me anything,
it's that never, ever trust a man with a limp.
Look, if they want to find out more about our tactics,
we turn it back on them.
Right, every time they ask a question, ask for more detail.
What did you mean by that? Can you explain?
Good. Anything else?
Sorry.
Okay,
I will sit in with Will; who do we have for Kalinda?
Most of our litigators were in on this.
So, they're all subject to being called.
All but one.
Miss Sharma, have you ever misrepresented your occupation
in order to interview a witness?
Could you be me specific?
Sure.
Have you ever misrepresented your occupation
in order to interview a witness,
as you did with my wife
to get into my house?
Objection, what does that have to do with the Veriscene case?
Well, Miss Sharma claims
she's never broken the law in pursuit of a case.
I have firsthand knowledge of such law-breaking.
So, Miss Sharma, can you please answer the question?
Could you repeat the question?
Sure. Were you Kalinda Sharma's direct supervisor?
We don't have direct supervisors here.
Did you tell her to investigate on the Veriscene case?
In what way, "Investigate"?
Okay, Will.
I get it.
We can do this all day.
You obfuscate,
I pull the judge out of court,
he raps you on the knuckles for being unresponsive,
and all you've done is waste half a day.
I take exception to your suggestion
that we're wasting anything.
But remember,
I'm not the one with a balloon payment due on his office.
Was that the elephant in the room?
Hello.
You were gonna get back to me.
I... Who is this?
F&E Construction.
You wanted me to reissue check.
Yes, I did. I said I'd get back to you, though.
I know, but you didn't.
So I decided to call you.
Okay, um, let me get all my ducks in a row, sir,
and I'll get back to you.
Sir?
No, you won't.
Excuse me?
You won't call me back.
You have no intention of calling me back.
I said I would, and so I...
Actually, um
I think we're done here.
No, we're not.
Could you be more specific?
Did you introduce judges
to bookies at your Wednesday night basketball...
Objection, relevance.
Isn't Judge Wynter relevant?
The man who awarded you $25 million?
Isn't he one of the judges you introduce to bookies?
Objection.
And weren't you confronted
about this at the grand jury?
Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm,
you have reference proceedings
that resulted in a sealed transcript.
Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer
to his own testimony.
This question requires your knowledge
of the grand jury investigation.
No, it merely requires Mr. Gardner's knowledge
of the grand jury investigation.
All right, we're taking this to the judge.
Okay, okay, okay.
You are all new to me,
so my apologies if I need to be reminded of your names,
but Ms.
Lockhart.
You are arguing
the only way these questions could be asked
is if they were taken from sealed transcripts?
Yes, Your Honor,
someone is leaking them grand jury testimony,
and we would argue this line of questioning
should be stricken.
If I may interject, Your Honor,
we're merely asking questions
based on our own knowledge.
And if you can allow me an explanation,
the movements that you see,
uh, these random movements
they're the consequence of a neurological disorder
I suffer from called tardive dyskinesia.
And I just didn't want you to misinterpret any of movements.
Okay, I won't.
I've had this condition since childhood.
Are you going somewhere with this, Mr. Canning?
No, I just wanted to explain.
Okay, thanks.
I will allow these questions to proceed.
Your Honor.
But if you produce evidence these questions are based
on sealed grand jury evidence,
I will exclude all such testimony from this suit.
We need to get Kalinda to follow Patti and find out
who's leaking this grand jury testimony.
No.
We need to talk settlement.
Will, we're vulnerable.
No, we're not.
There's nothing there.
But what is there doesn't look good.
You played basketball with him,
you introduced him to a bookie, and he awarded us
seven million above our ask.
Here's what I suggest.
We offer to drop the Veriscene class action.
It's what they want, anyway.
Damn it.
I know, but it's the smart move.
We need get this behind us.
This balloon payment, our clients...
Patric Edelstein is making noise.
I mean, he's 20% of our quarter.
Everything's falling apart as we fight this.
Uh, do you want me...
No, it's all right, we've just been...
riding close to the edge this whole year.
It's not for anyone to know.
I understand.
Okay.
Let's make this go away.
They brought out the buffet.
This must be serious.
You drop the lawsuit,
and we drop the Veriscene class action.
That's our offer; take it or leave it.
Fruit?
Please.
No. But thank you.
Don't you want to take back to your client?
No.
We're not caving on the appeal.
We know.
You have no case. Not without some grand jury leak.
You don't understand.
This isn't about a case.
You-you want to tell them?
No, no.
You're much better at the nasty stuff.
We're not here to settle.
We're here to destroy you.
Our clients are tired of being sued by you.
Four class actions in two years?
They've taken it personally.
Look at you. Hi, boo-boo.
They've set aside a large sum of money to put you out of business.
That's why we're here, to make an example of you.
超级追捕队是一批警察精英 对二人穷追不舍
You've seen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
We're the Super-posse.
So, thank you for the offer,
but no.
We're getting paid a lot of money to make you go bankrupt.
Thank you for the fruit, though.
Hi. That's pretty.
Well, Kalinda, funny seeing you here.
Yeah, almost as funny as seeing you here,
with Ms. Nyholm, leaking grand jury testimony.
Mr. Wiley is legally sharing
his own testimony before the grand jury.
Really?
Yeah, the state's attorney
wasn't interested in pursuing the case against Will Gardner.
Ms. Nyholm is.
And our kids love playing together.
So it's all perfectly legal.
Hi.
Cary, we're having some trouble with Andrew Wiley,
an investigator from the state's attorney's office.
Yes, I know.
He's the one working with Nyholm and Canning.
I doubt that.
Wiley doesn't break the rules.
Unless he's using his own testimony.
Yep. So we need something from you.
Well, you know that I can't share what I know about the grand jury
because that would be unethical.
Yes, but you can use your knowledge in another way.
Thank you for coming.
It means so much to me.
I didn't come here to visit, Jackie.
I came to recommend that you retain a lawyer.
You... Why?
You took money from my children's trust
so that you could outbid me
on my family home.
I intend to sue you.
I'm sorry, Alicia.
This family's been through so much, and I...
I thought I knew best.
I'm so sorry.
Jackie, please.
What do you want?
I want you to accept my apology.
No, you don't.
I want to make things right.
It'll be good for Zach and Grace and... and Peter.
You want Peter to win.
That's what you want.
Eli was here, wasn't he?
I-I-I don't know.
I...
He...
He can't do it without you.
Here's what I want, Jackie.
You sign the house over to the kids,
you put it in their names, I won't sue.
You want me to accept your apology, show me you mean it.
Sign the house over to the kids.
Excuse me.
Watch your toes.
Everyone, please, indoor voices.
Your Honor, like you,
I look at life a little differently--
with a little more caution,
a little more quiet.
Why like me?
I'm sorry, I...
You said "Like me." What do you mean?
What we mean, Your Honor,
is that the defense's motion is a desperate ploy
to avoid responsibility.
Mr. Canning asked Ms. Sharma one question
that couldn't have been in Mr. Wiley's grand jury testimony,
Your Honor.
The $2,000 in cash Mr. Gardner gave to a judge--
money that was supposedly for UNICEF.
Was for UNICEF.
This was evidence that Mr.Wiley
personally witnessed, Your Honor.
Yes, but the question isn't whether he personally witnessed it or not.
Andrew, did you testify to it or did you witness it?
Wait a minute, you can't talk to our client.
Andrew, which one did you do?
Oh, my God.
Andrew, no, stop right there!
He's right, I just witnessed it.
Due to this admission, Your Honor,
all the evidence regarding Mr. Gardner's
bribing of a judge should be excluded.
Your Honor, I'd like to add another name to our witness list:
Alicia Florrick.
I have to witness prep you.
They're coming after you,
trying to get to Will bribing judges another way.
I know.
F&E Construction.
What is it?
Why?
I found a check in your file from Canada.
An un-cashed check from 2007.
Yeah. That-that shouldn't be there.
That should be in my personal file.
It's for $21,000.
That would go a long way to pay your tax bill.
I know. Do you have the check?
Thanks.
It's-it's complicated.
I called the number on it.
As part of your tax work,
I called employers for updated checks.
When?
When did I call? Tuesday.
Did you speak to anyone?
Yes.
Who?
I don't know.
He wouldn't give me his name.
He asked for the number on your check.
Did you give it?
No.
Thanks.
He called me back.
What's going on, Kalinda?
It's just something from an old thing.
"An old thing"?
Is it Lemond Bishop?
No. I'm gonna go and take care of it.
Kalinda.
Yeah?
Nothing.
I'll be back.
I'm-I'm gonna go take care of it.
That might be too big for you.
I've got some lighter ones around the corner.
No, this one's fine.
You sure?
You need anything else, let me know.
And it's not just the sink, the shower, too.
Okay, I'll call down, but we're probably on our own.
They go out of their way not to fix things
when they are converting the condos, so it forces you to buy.
Are you gonna?
Buy?
I don't know.
I like it here, but maybe there's better.
Dad wants you to buy the house.
He...
He told you
he wanted to sell it, didn't he?
Would you?
Buy the house? No.
Why not? You were going to.
I know, but everything's up in the air right now.
You got a raise.
Yes. But sometimes getting a raise means
that you cost more;
so when they're looking to downsize,
it's easier to fire you than someone cheaper.
And they're looking to downsize?
No, but we're just going through a bad spell.
You should move in.
We should all live in one house.
What?
Not like you guys are married.
Like a commune.
I've kind of grown to like you.
Yeah? Not Zach?
No, not Zach.
He's getting too big.
You shouldn't answer it.
It's probay work.
They can't fire you if they can't find you.
Very funny.
Hello?
Alicia Florrick?
Is it work?
No. Wrong number.
This is Kalinda. Please leave a message.
You ready for this?
I hope so.
Don't worry, it'll all be about me.
Just tell the truth.
Have you seen Kalinda?
No, why?
She's not in today.
She's probably just late.
You were second chair
on the Veriscene case, right, Mrs. Florrick?
Yes.
Did you have ex parte communication
with Judge Wynter during the trial?
No.
And you have no personal relationship with Judge Wynter?
That's correct.
But someone you know does?
You mean Will?
No.
I mean your husband.
Peter Florrick.
I-I have no idea.
You have no idea whether your husband
has a pernal relationship with Judge Wynter?
I mean, I know that he knows him,
but I don't know the extent of their relationship.
Did you know that your husband
met with Judge Wynter three times
in the week leading up to the Veriscene verdict?
No.
Really?
On the eve of Judge Wynter's decision
to award you $25 million,
your husband met with him three times,
and you had no idea?
That's correct.
Are we working off the assumption they did, in fact, meet?
How do we know this?
Because we're going to subpoena Peter Florrick.
You're going to subpoena the state's attorney?
We already have.
Hold the door, please.
Thanks.
No problem. 28th?
Yeah.
So, you seeing Alicia?
Am I seeing Alicia?
No, actually, I'm being deposed.
Oh. Really?
Although it occurred to me
I've never seen where Alicia works.
Does she know you're coming?
Not that it matters either way.
I don't know.
So you must be looking forward to getting back to the law?
I am.
I think convicts call it "Short time."
Really?
I never did.
Well, hi.
Hi.
Look who I found.
Yes. Welcome.
I thought I would come and meet you.
Which one?
You, Peter.
Thought you might want to see my office.
Hello, Eli.
I...
Hi.
H-llo, everyone.
Hi. I was just showing Peter my office.
He's here for a deposition.
Really?
Great.
Cary.
Hey, Cary.
Hello.
Mr. Florrick. How you doing?
Hey, how you guys doing?
So how's it going here?
At Lockhart-Gardner? It's good.
I mean, I loved the state's attorney's office,
but there's lot of smart people here, too.
One of our new associates.
Hey, Kalinda.
It's a surprise party for you.
I'm impressed.
What you have done in three years is amazing.
Thank you.
Okay.
I guess I should go meet my executioners.
Oh, Peter, you didn't have to do this.
You could've blown it off.
It's a stupid nuisance suit.
I wanted to get out and stretch my legs.
Hey. Come over tonight.
I'll have to work.
Just to see the house.
Stay for five minutes, tops.
I wish I could.
Peter?
Have you checked in on Jackie lately?
Have I? Yeah. Why?
I'm worried
She seems confused.
She's getting older.
Congratulations.
You made it.
You need money?
Just an advance on the work so far.
Why?
Kalinda, what's going on?
I have to go.
You have to... Why?
I thought you were liking it here.
I am liking it here.
Okay, then you would understand my confusion.
Look...
we're in a bit of trouble.
We're short on receivables.
Patric Edelstein is delaying his monthly,
and we have some long-term suits that haven't paid out yet.
I can get you some.
Not everything.
Okay.
This is good-bye?
Just a little bit.
You're gonna make me cry.
I don't know.
It feels like things are falling apart.
You'll build them up again, that's what you do.
And you met with Judge Wynter three times
before this last Thursday, the day of the verdict?
Yes.
Is that a lot for you?
Yeah.
In fact, before these three meetings,
you had only met him once...
in 2008
at a judges' lunch,
with 12 other judges.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
So why'd you meet with him?
Those three times?
I like him.
Did the subject of your wife's lawsuit
come up at these meetings?
No.
Really?
At the same time you were meeting with this judge,
your wife had a suit in front of him,
and the subject never came up?
That's correct.
This grand jury investigation
into Will Gardner's supposed bribing of three judges,
including Judge Wynter...
Objection.
We are not refering to the content of that investigation,
just to Mr. Florrick's supervision of it.
But just to correct you,
Ms. Scott-Car had supervision over it.
Yes, until you removed her.
I removed her because the grand jury had concluded.
But the state's attorney can bring charges again?
He can. I chose not to.
You also chose not to bring charges against the three judges
involved in this bribery scheme.
The supposed bribery scheme? Yes.
Why not?
I didn't want to.
I thought Ms. Scott-Carr had gone beyond her directive.
So when you met with Judge Wynter...
he owed you?
Did you not want to answer?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that was a question.
Didn't you ask Judge Wynter to decide
this verdict for your wife as a quid pro quo
for dropping his investigation?
No.
But isn't that a fair conclusion?
No.
And how is that?
Because my wife and I are separated.
Then I...
That is news to me.
Then what other reason could there be for these meetings?
His support for my campaign.
So I guess you could accuse me
of being corrupt for myself,
but not for my wife.
How's it going?
Good. You?
Good.
I have to head out. I just wanted to say good night.
That man who called me,
F&E Constructionon,
he called me at home,
and he said my name.
He said your name?
Yes.
Did you give your name?
No.
Kalinda, who is this man?
We said we would be up front with each other.
I know.
Is this man dangerous?
Yeah.
Well, who is he?
He's my husband.
Come on. You don't have anything.
The state's attorney just told you
there's no way he could have done this for his wife
because they're separated.
And he's done this with some considerable expense
to his own political career...
because it's now in the record that they've separated.
So, what do you have?
A passion to see this through.
We take back our offer to drop the class action.
You lost. Face it.
They're right.
We lost.
We should probably just head out. You think?
Here's the thing, though.
We were the distraction.
You were the distraction? What does that mean?
Have you checked on your top client, Patric Edelstein?
He's no longer your top client.
He's ours.
We just got the text.
He's been unhappy with Will's suspension,
and with your distraction with this lawsuit.
Sleight of hand. You were watching the right,
you should've been watching the left.
Mommy!
That's right, we're done here.
Mommy's coming home.
After you.
No, no, after you.
Please.
Mommy!
Hello!
Let's go. Come on.
Oops.
And it's too late to call him.
They planned on that, too.
So, tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
How you doing?
Me? I'm, uh...
Okay.
You?
Same.
That was weird.
With Peter today?
Yes, it was.
Do you think it was a mistake?
No.
Good night, Alicia.
Good night, Will.
Mom, my doorknob's still broken.
How about some wine?
No, I have to get back.
They didn't change much.
The house? Yeah.
They tried to flip it,
but they didn't put any work into it so nobody wanted it.
Thanks for today.
I think you stopped the suit.
I guess I just told the truth.
That's bigger than you think.
Dad, the pizza's ready.
Okay.
Pizza?
No, I have to get up early for work tomorrow.
Things are in flux.
When aren't things in flux?
Hey, come say good-bye to your mom.
She's leaving.
I love you both. I'll see you in a few days.
Stay, Mom.
No one will think it means anything.
Just...
have some pizza.
Then you can go.
You're getting big.
I love you.
