第七季 第三集
so what &apos;d you think ?
it was good .
that &apos;s it ?
&quot; good &quot; ?
i enjoyed it .
when you told me i was going to be &quot; losing my virginity , &quot;
i didn &apos;t think you meant showing me
raiders of the lost ark for the first time .
my apologies . i chose my words poorly .
i should have said you were about
to have your world rocked on my couch .
anyway , thank you for watching it .
it &apos;s one of my all @-@ time favorites .
it was very entertaining ...
despite the glaring story problem .
story problem ? !
you-- oh , amy ...
what a dewy @-@ eyed moon @-@ calf you are .
raiders of the lost ark is the love child
of steven spielberg and george lucas ,
two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation .
i &apos;ve watched it 36 times ,
except for the snake scene and the face @-@ melting scene ,
which i can only watch when it &apos;s still light out , but ...
i defy you to find a story problem .
here &apos;s my jaw ...
drop it .
all right .
indiana jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story .
if he weren &apos;t in the film ,
it would turn out exactly the same .
oh , i see your confusion . you don &apos;t understand .
indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip .
no , i do ,
and if he weren &apos;t in the movie ,
the nazis would have still found the ark ,
taken it to the island , opened it up and all died ...
just like they did .
let me close that for ya .
i thought you went to the comic book store on wednesdays .
yeah , but sheldon and amy were having date night
and they don &apos;t need me there to make it awkward .
they have each other for that .
so , how was school ?
oh , good . check it out .
the disappointing child by beverly hofstadter .
you bought my mom &apos;s book ?
yeah !
it &apos;s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class .
come on . not that book .
it @-@ it &apos;s got , like , every horrible story
from my childhood in it .
oh , cool . are there pictures ?
seriously , please find another book .
oh , come on . why ? how bad could it be ?
there @-@ there &apos;s chapters about potty training ,
and bed @-@ wetting and ...
masturbation .
basically , if something came out of me ,
she wrote about it !
you know what ? do whatever you want ,
just don &apos;t talk to me about it .
not even the chapter on the breast @-@ feeding crisis ?
it was not a crisis .
apparently , i favored the left one ,
she got a little lopsided .
oh , my god , you still go left !
which celebrity would you say i look like the most ?
halle berry .
why ?
stuart and i are putting dating profiles online ,
and it &apos;s one of the questions .
and thank you-- i &apos;d kill for that woman &apos;s bone structure .
why are you reading pride and prejudice ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
amy ruined raiders of the lost ark for me ,
so now i &apos;m trying to find
something beloved to her and ruin that .
because her life wasn &apos;t enough ?
wait ...
how can , how can anyone ruin raiders ?
it &apos;s perfect .
yeah , except for the fact that indiana jones
is completely irrelevant to the story . with or without him ,
the nazis find the ark , open it and die .
hey , wait a minute .
no , the nazis were digging in the wrong place .
the only reason they got the ark
was because indy found it first .
actually , they were only digging in the wrong place
because indy had the medallion .
without him , they would have had the medallion
and dug in the right place .
okay , i know you don &apos;t want to talk about it ,
but can i just ask you one question about your mom &apos;s book ?
no .
i just want to know
why a five @-@ year @-@ old boy puts on his mom &apos;s makeup
and wears balloon boobies .
they weren &apos;t boobies , they were muscles .
and the makeup was green .
i was pretending to be the hulk .
you were wearing her bra .
that was to keep my muscles from sagging !
can we please stop talking about this ? !
okay , okay .
but you know , as a student of psychology
who got a check @-@ plus on her first homework assignment ...
i think , sometimes , it &apos;s good to
open up about these things .
okay , fine .
do you want to know why i dressed like the hulk ?
because i was always mad at my mom
and i wanted to smash my way out of that house .
well , why were you so angry ?
gee , i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s because i was always the subject of her little experiments .
did you get to the chapter where she staged the easter egg hunt
with no eggs to see how long i &apos;d keep looking ?
the answer , by the way :
june .
sweetie , i &apos;m so sorry .
i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better .
i do , too , but there &apos;s not .
really ? are you sure about that ?
of course , who am i to argue with a check @-@ plus student ?
just warning you-- i &apos;m gonna go right .
don &apos;t make a big deal out of it .
is makeup really necessary ?
well , when someone looks at your dating profile ,
the first thing they see is your picture .
i just want to make sure you look fun
and full of life and not like a body
they just pulled out of the river .
all right , here we go , and ...
smile .
okay , uh @-@ uh , that one &apos;s in the bank .
how about this ?
turn away , and then turn back into it .
but when you do ,
imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet .
you got it .
okay , uh ,
let &apos;s try it again .
uh , but this time , pretend the girl you want to meet
doesn &apos;t want to hurt you .
i don &apos;t think i can give you that .
come on . one more time .
yeah , it &apos;s , it &apos;s a little blurry ,
but i think that works in your favor .
do you want a beer ?
sure .
hey , have you finished writing your profile yet ?
almost .
oh , what did you put
as the one @-@ word description of yourself ?
i put unobjectionable .
but now that i hear it out loud ,
it just seems like i &apos;m being cocky .
what did you put for your best feature ?
my parents &apos; money .
uh , what did you put for your best feature ?
i put not applicable .
come on , dude , you &apos;re being too hard on yourself .
you &apos;ve got a lot of good stuff going on .
really ? like what ?
well , okay , you &apos;re a , you &apos;re a talented artist ,
you own your own business .
neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman .
okay , well , can we imply
that you &apos;re well @-@ endowed ?
i do have one oddly long testicle .
okay , now you &apos;re talking like a winner !
whatcha doin &apos; ?
oh , it turns out amy &apos;s beloved pride and prejudice
is a flawless masterpiece .
he &apos;s got too much pride ,
she &apos;s got too much prejudice--
it just works .
so you &apos;re looking to ruin something for her
in the funny pages ?
amy has a fondness for the comic strip marmaduke .
故事的主角是一只顽皮的巨型犬大丹麦狗
and ... ?
and i think i &apos;ve got it .
consider :
a family possesses a dog that is so large
and poorly disciplined ,
he causes nothing but problems .
why do they keep him ? !
maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy
and didn &apos;t know how big he was gonna be .
of course .
you know , why couldn &apos;t she just like ziggy ?
yeah ?
that thing &apos;s riddled with plot holes .
sorry , buddy .
i think she &apos;s a fan of garfield as well .
oh , darn it , now so am i.
i &apos;ll see you later .
i gotta go watch a stupid football game with penny .
wait-- hang on .
you &apos;ve spent time with amy .
can you think of anything she &apos;s fond of
that has a bunch of flaws she hasn &apos;t noticed ?
i gotta go .
you ready to go ?
yep .
hey , and maybe this time
you don &apos;t try and talk sports with the guys .
some sports bar .
it &apos;s like they never even heard of quidditch .
do we really have to go ?
oh , come on . every time we &apos;re about
to hang out with my friends , you don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s like , &quot; it &apos;s too loud , &quot;
or &quot; the bathroom &apos;s too dirty , &quot;
or &quot; they put a chicken wing in my ear ... &quot; i mean ...
well , you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re right .
let &apos;s just go .
hey , what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing , i &apos;m fine .
all right , hang on .
is this still about your mom &apos;s book ?
no . not everything is about my mom .
&apos;cause if you &apos;re still upset about that ,
we don &apos;t have to go .
except this is totally about my mom .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i never should have read that book .
you know what ? you want to just get dinner
and watch the game here ?
that sounds nice .
okay .
or , you know , we could get take @-@ out
and watch the blu @-@ ray extended version
of the hobbit movie with commentary track .
on account of how sad i am about my mom .
leonard , you ready for lunch ?
one sec !
hey . sorry .
hi , penny .
hi .
all right , sweetie .
you hang in there today .
i &apos;ll try , but i might be sad again tonight .
okay .
sex at work ? !
leave it alone .
that &apos;s my girlfriend .
sorry .
who just had sex with me at work !
damn . how &apos;d you swing that ?
well , whenever i talk about how awful my mom was ,
penny will do anything to make me feel better .
seriously ?
look , i mean ...
i &apos;m not proud of it , but it does work .
i @-@ i got her to watch
a six @-@ part documentary on monty python .
对喜剧有十分重大的影响
even i was bored , i just wanted to see
if she &apos;d make it to the end .
you sound kind of proud of it .
i am ; i &apos;m really proud .
hello , sheldon .
is everything okay ?
yes .
why ?
well , the last time you made an unscheduled video @-@ chat ,
there was a curly fry in your regular fries
and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey .
april 13 ...
a dark night , indeed .
so what can i do for you ?
i &apos;m calling to invite you
to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening .
really ?
yes .
you were kind enough
to watch raiders of the lost ark with me .
so i &apos;d like to return the favor
by inviting you to watch an episode
of your favorite childhood television series ,
little house on the prairie .
that sounds lovely .
why are you rubbing your hands together ?
i &apos;m putting on lotion .
are you in or not ?
of course i &apos;m in .
excellent .
then i shall see you tomorrow .
good night , dr. fowler .
good night , dr. cooper .
good night , indeed .
what a rube .
why would i put on lotion when i have such soft hands ?
you were really quiet during dinner .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
i guess i was just thinking about my mom ,
and how sad my childhood was .
yeah , i bet it sucked .
i &apos;m gonna take a bath ; you do the dishes .
how about i take a bath with you
and see what happens .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen :
i &apos;m gonna take a bath ,
and you &apos;re gonna do the dishes .
that &apos;s it ?
no compassion ?
aw , poor howie .
we good ? i &apos;m gonna take a bath .
bernie ...
god , what is going on with you ?
i &apos;m sharing my pain .
and i &apos;m not buying it . try again .
i &apos;m learning to be a man in a culture
where it &apos;s increasingly difficult to know how ... ?
strike two .
i &apos;m copying leonard .
when he does this to penny ,
they have sex and watch monty python .
howard !
i know .
it was dumb ,
i shouldn &apos;t have done it .
and it &apos;s making me feel sad ...
so sad .
you know , why don &apos;t you take a bath ? i &apos;ll do the dishes .
three , two , one ...
that &apos;s it .
our dating profiles are live on the internet .
attention all shoppers :
my business is open for business !
that &apos;s right , ladies .
for all you know ,
i &apos;m confident and fun to be around .
oh , cool , it tells you
when someone &apos;s reading your profile .
&quot; jenny309 . &quot;
i hope that &apos;s not her weight .
if it is , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll take her .
good one .
ooh , i got one , too .
the ladies are coming to us .
oh , man , if i &apos;d started this years ago ,
i &apos;d be divorced two or three times by now .
what ... ? another one .
you know , it ... it &apos;s weird .
when they &apos;re reading your profile , does it ...
does it make you feel exposed ?
like they see you naked ?
well , they &apos;re not running away screaming , so , no .
i love little house .
it made me want to live on a farm so much
i tried to milk my cat .
that tangy bowl of cheerios
was not worth the stitches .
well , you sit back , relax
and enjoy a beloved childhood memory .
you see that cabin there ?
i read they were illegally squatting on indian land .
yeah .
personally , i think what we did
to the native americans was wrong ,
but this is your favorite show , not mine .
oh , look at little laura ingalls ,
eating that peanut butter sandwich .
peanut butter ? !
that &apos;s strange , since peanut butter
wasn &apos;t introduced until the early 1900s .
if i knew this show was about time travel ,
i would have watched it much sooner .
you &apos;re trying to get back at me
for what i said about raiders of the lost ark .
that &apos;s silly .
almost as silly as dr. baker having a telephone ,
since telephones only existed
in large cities at that time .
this is more like little house on the preposterous .
sheldon , we &apos;re in a relationship .
when you get angry , just tell me .
you don &apos;t need to seek revenge .
are you sure ?
every time my dad stayed out all night ,
my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco .
well , that &apos;s not how we &apos;re going to do it .
fine .
i &apos;m mad at you .
not only did you ruin raiders for me ,
you may have ruined the whole franchise .
except for the fourth one ,
which was bad before you got your mitts on it .
i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have said it .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
do you feel better ?
yes .
but not as good as i &apos;m going to when i tell you
that your precious garfield has no reason to hate mondays .
he &apos;s a cat . he doesn &apos;t have a job .
hey , i was just-- what is happening ?
oh , just a little treat .
i know you &apos;ve been feeling really bad
about your mom lately .
oh , oh , i have .
so bad .
and i wanted to make you feel better ,
so i planned something very special for you .
i can already feel it working .
hello , leonard .
mom ? !
i understand you have been whining about my parenting
in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend .
i ... uh ...
bernadette told me everything .
now you don &apos;t get the left or the right .
let &apos;s discuss why you continue to involve me
in your sex life .
oh , please , mommy .
no , mommy .
when you were six years old ,
you walked in on me and your father naked .
i was swatting his bottom
with your brand new ping pong paddle .
i didn &apos;t dream that ?
how did that make you feel ?
penny , come back !
i &apos;m sad for real now !
in the last two hours ,
162 women have read our profiles .
how many of them have sent us messages ?
combined ?
yes .
zero .
dude , this is ... this is brutal .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so rejected .
and i had a rescue dog
who ran back to the pound .
this is the worst .
if we &apos;re gonna get shot down ,
we might as well just go to a bar
and do it old school .
and make them look us in the eye .
yeah , anything is better than this .
hello .
not interested .
i was wrong . this is worse .
wait , wait-- if it wasn &apos;t for indiana jones ,
the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse !
that &apos;s true !
he collected and delivered the ark
to the proper authorities for filing .
like a hero !
yeah ! yes !
right !
although , technically ,
indy was supposed to take the ark
to a museum to be studied .
he couldn &apos;t even get that done .
