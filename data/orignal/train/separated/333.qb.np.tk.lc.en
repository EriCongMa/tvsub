got a marriage proposal in the diner .
where they gonna honeymoon-- a porta @-@ potty ?
that &apos;s the saddest thing i ever seen ,
and i was at a rolling stones concert last night .
the guy wants me to put this ring her pie .
&apos;cause you know what they say--
if you like it , then you gotta put a ring in it .
well , this is a first .
a guy left me a half a tuna sandwich as a tip .
which is still more than europeans leave .
there &apos;s a proposal at table 40,
and you have to do it .
i already delivered a baby in here today .
well , they &apos;ve obviously been dating a while ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s eating carbs in front of him .
caroline is so happy right now .
she still believes in all that love crap .
uh , she also believes table 14 is table 40 .
here &apos;s your pie .
i have a feeling this dessert is gonna be extra @-@ sweet .
it &apos;s an engagement ring !
he hid it in the pie !
yes ! yes , i &apos;ll marry you .
i know i said i was cool with waiting ,
but i wasn &apos;t cool with it !
yep . she messed up . this isn &apos;t yours .
um ... again . i &apos;m cool with waiting .
and for you two , pie on the house ,
and i &apos;m guessing a very tense cab ride home .
where &apos;s earl ? he isn &apos;t here yet ,
and i &apos;m worried .
wait--it &apos;s not a black holiday , is it ?
earl better not be dead , or i &apos;ll kill him .
we have a joint suicide pact .
we smoke a joint and then we kill ourselves .
he &apos;s probably just late . don &apos;t overreact .
that &apos;s exactly what janine at 911 said ten minutes ago
when i overreacted with her !
you called 911 ?
when i came home three hours late last night ,
you had already put all my stuff out on the street .
hi , everybody !
wait a minute-- where &apos;s earl ?
it &apos;s not as much fun walking in here
if he &apos;s not down there looking up at my boobs .
he &apos;s late .
late ?
oh ... i &apos;m sorry , max .
i know you two were close .
see ? that &apos;s the kind of sympathy i was looking for
from you and janine .
sophie , what &apos;s with those needles ?
oh , yeah--i &apos;m getting ready to shoot up .
sophie &apos;s starting her fertility shots today .
before long , we &apos;ll be parents .
look out , pta meetings ...
i &apos;ll bring the p. she &apos;ll bring the t &amp; a.
all right , come on , oleg . i &apos;m ready for my first shot .
come on , let &apos;s go to the ladies &apos; room
so you can poke me real good .
you &apos;re not poking her anywhere in here .
thanks to you , the handicap stall is a condom graveyard !
sophie , you know i &apos;m only afraid of two things--
needles and kenny rogers after the eyelift .
he did not know when to fold &apos; em .
someone else will have to give you your shots .
well , i guess i could do it .
roll up your sleeve .
okay , yeah .
i &apos;ll roll up my sleeve ...
and then pull down my spanx ,
&apos;cause you gotta put it where the sun don &apos;t shine , baby .
uh ... this is a little awkward , but sophie ,
i was unaware i &apos;d be injecting your badonkadonk .
okay , han .
take my hand ...
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s real good . all right , come on .
and i &apos;m gonna take you now
to show you your first lady butt .
now , there &apos;s a heart @-@ warming tableau
that norman rockwell somehow missed .
hello , ladies .
earl ! i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re alive .
you always go straight to dead , max .
but thanks for sending the paramedics .
i needed help finding my apple tv remote .
i was stuck on the phone with barry
from my old jazz band the early birds .
you may have read about us in &quot; never made it &quot; magazine .
caroline and i were on the cover last week .
he told me they are holding a anniversary show down at ruby &apos;s ,
and the early birds are invited to perform
on friday night .
earl !
one of my dreams is to hear you play live .
and the other one already happened--
breakfast all day at mcdonald &apos;s .
well , i hate to burst your mcmuffin , max ,
but that ain &apos;t gonna happen ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not invited to play .
ruby doesn &apos;t want me there .
ruby hates earl .
well , then max hates ruby .
oh ! what happened between you and ruby ?
was it a crazy love affair ?
we were hot .
oh ! an amour fou ?
no , it was a @-@ more i fooled around with her sister .
look ! earl and the early birds !
where &apos;d you get that ?
i went down the street to smart &amp; vinyl .
12.95 .
you spent 12.95 on earl &apos;s record ,
but you wouldn &apos;t lend me 25 cents for a latte yesterday ?
look , we gotta do something about earl .
he deserves to play at that jazz club .
i mean , he is the only one at this diner
who has a chance to make it .
i appreciate your enthusiasm , but of all of us here ,
you think the 80 @-@ year @-@ old has the brightest future ?
for as long as i &apos;ve known earl ,
all he talked about is how proud he was of that band .
and that ruby woman
is denying him the chance to play again ?
not on my watch .
if i own one .
which ... i do not .
we are going down to that club
and talk some sense into ruby ,
because earl would do the same for us if we had any talent .
i just have to ask--
you do think we &apos;re gonna get out of here one day .
oh , for sure !
in body bags .
wow , this place is the real deal !
all the jazz greats sang here .
look--ella fitzgerald , sarah vaughan , nina simone .
you know , there was a moment when i wanted to be--
was there ever a moment when you wanted to be quiet ?
scotch on the house , please .
normally , i don &apos;t drink in the afternoon ,
but it &apos;s still morning .
i &apos;ll have a lillet .
i hear it was billie holiday &apos;s poison .
you know , there was a moment when i was--
that moment &apos;s over .
sir , we &apos;re here to see ruby .
who wants to see ruby ?
she &apos;s coming in real hot , max .
maybe this isn &apos;t a good idea .
there &apos;s only one old woman who scares me ,
and his name is steven tyler .
i &apos;m ruby .
well ... if it isn &apos;t
&quot; miss doesn &apos;t invite people to stuff . &quot;
who &apos;s also known as miss very , very pretty .
i don &apos;t need someone to tell me that i &apos;m pretty .
that &apos;s what i told roy orbison
when he wrote &quot; pretty woman &quot; for me .
what do you little girls want ?
we &apos;re friends of earl .
of earl ?
you know , earl .
from the early birds .
you know , the guy who put this club on the map .
oh , that earl !
he &apos;s a bum !
girl , you better check yourself !
no one says anything bad about my earl .
your ear--well , i prefer not to go to jail
for murdering earl &apos;s girlfriend , but ...
it &apos;s not that strong a preference .
here , hold my hoops !
oh , no , no , no , no .
max isn &apos;t earl &apos;s girlfriend .
he &apos;s more like a father @-@ figure to her .
more like a great @-@ grandfather figure !
he &apos;s both ! hold my hoops !
everybody calm down , take a beat .
a jazzy beat , of course .
i only have two questions for you--
why is she so upset ?
and what the hell is a jazzy beat ?
i &apos;m upset
because i know earl helped build this club ,
and he wasn &apos;t invited to play your anniversary show .
that &apos;s right-- &apos; cause he &apos;s a bum !
hold my hoops again !
that no @-@ good , two @-@ timin &apos; musical genius
will never set foot in my club while i &apos;m alive .
here , hold my hoops
while i unstrap the pistol on my shoe .
ruby , come on , can &apos;t you just let him play ?
i mean , he &apos;s just a cashier at a diner now .
what &apos;d you just call him ?
earl is more than just a cashier .
that is his job , not what he is .
how dare you !
yeah , how dare she !
hold my hoops !
hold your hoops ! i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s not a cashier . he &apos;s a musical genius .
damn it .
i can &apos;t believe that earl would end up
in a dead @-@ end job as a cashier in a diner .
well , i mean , it doesn &apos;t have to be a dead @-@ end .
he could get out anytime--
him and the other people that work there .
all right , he can come .
but just make sure he shows up and he is sober .
that man only has two settings--
&quot; high off his ass &quot; or &quot; not in the room . &quot;
he &apos;ll be here .
okay , i don &apos;t know whose hoops are whose .
we got a real &quot; whose hoops &quot; over here .
isn &apos;t that exciting , earl ?
you &apos;re playing at the club !
i &apos;m gonna go ahead and call it a comeback .
and then i &apos;m gonna go find an outfit that i can take back .
so , earl , obviously , i &apos;ll be your date ,
and obviously , we &apos;ll pretend that we don &apos;t know caroline .
i can &apos;t believe that you girls went to see ruby
and came back with your hoops and hair .
but there &apos;s one problem :
i no longer own a saxophone .
how can you not own a saxophone ?
that &apos;s like me not owning muh jugs .
i sold it &apos; cause i needed the money .
i had just kicked heroin ,
and i was buying a lotta cocaine .
but thanks , girls . it would have been really nice .
aw , earl , that &apos;s too bad .
i was really excited to see the show .
i think when we went to ruby &apos;s , i caught the jazz bug .
in my day , when you caught the jazz bug , you had syphilis .
obviously , we have to get earl a saxophone
so he can play in the show .
max , if you put this much effort into our life ,
we &apos;d be off the cover of &quot; never made it &quot; magazine .
we can &apos;t afford a musical instrument .
trust me , if there &apos;s anything i know how to find ,
it &apos;s cheap sax .
so , earl , you &apos;re back in your old stomping grounds .
how &apos;s it feel ?
should bring back a lotta memories , huh ?
it sure should !
there &apos;s my girl !
she and i used to have a lot of great talks .
earl , you played with ella fitzgerald ?
it &apos;s possible .
or else i talked to that picture .
i did a lot of drugs .
whenever i think of ella , i just want to
♪ scooby @-@ doo @-@ bop @-@ bop , squiddly dop @-@ dop @-@ bah ♪
拟声吟唱是即兴唱出旋律和节奏
do that again ,
and i &apos;m gonna squiddly @-@ da @-@ bop you in the head .
i gotta admit , i &apos;m excited to play .
i got my mojo working
and my pacemaker on cruise control .
i appreciate all the trouble , girls .
just don &apos;t forget us when you make it big .
and we won &apos;t forget you when we make it big .
well , well , well .
earl with a couple of 18 @-@ year @-@ old white girls .
it &apos;s the &apos; 60s all over again .
if it was the &apos; 60s ,
you and i would be in the coat closet
gettin &apos; on the good foot doin &apos; the bad thing .
you look beautiful as ever , ruby .
well , earl ,
i must say , you look ...
wiser ? distinguished ?
mature like a fine wine .
i was gonna say less on heroin .
i haven &apos;t done smack in 30 years .
i even quit honey smacks
&apos;cause i thought it might tempt me .
ruby , just putting it out there--
if you need someone to warm up the crowd ,
i was in my high school &apos;s jazz choir .
i sang &quot; god bless the child . &quot;
well , god bless the children
that had to listen to that .
well , it &apos;s gonna be very interesting , earl .
i don &apos;t think i ever remember you playing sober .
you always said the junk gave you the funk .
i did ?
well , that was clever .
you know what wasn &apos;t clever ?
leaving your underpants on my sister &apos;s breakfast table .
anyway , break a leg .
or ... a heart .
you &apos;re good at that .
i was good at a lot of things with you , ruby .
girls , i just realized ...
i never played straight .
excuse me , ladies .
i have to freshen up in the men &apos;s room .
you don &apos;t think &quot; freshen up &quot; means ...
what i think we both think it means .
no . earl &apos;s been clean for 30 years .
plus , you don &apos;t just go into the bathroom of a jazz club
where you did heroin to find heroin .
i &apos;ll just go take a peek .
earl &apos;s still in the bathroom .
you know what &apos;s not in the bathroom ?
doors on the stalls .
damn it ! i forgot i invited people .
hey , girls , come on .
admit it-- everyone hates jazz , right ?
well , i love it .
see ? it &apos;s the worst !
i like going downtown .
i don &apos;t have to tell you that .
where &apos;s han ?
he &apos;s standing right under me , isn &apos;t me ?
ooh ! $ 15 a drink .
that &apos;s your whole night in secaucus !
han , i can &apos;t take shots and jazz
and your personality at the same time .
sophie , relax . it &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll buy you a drink first .
hold my syringe while i get my credit card .
who are you , my mom ?
oh , earl , how you doing ?
max , that &apos;s real sweet of you
to score some dope for me , but i &apos;m gonna pass .
no . these are sophie &apos;s fertility drugs .
all this &apos;ll give you is great breasts .
still no . if i had great breasts ,
i &apos;d never get out of bed .
good evening . my name is ruby .
and in case you forget that ,
it &apos;s written in neon all over the place .
you ready ?
yep . ready to leave .
what ?
you heard ruby .
i &apos;ve never played not high ,
and i &apos;m not about to try it now .
now , i know you &apos;re all here for the early birds tonight ,
so hang onto your hats and hide your sisters .
and help me welcome back to the stage
the early birds , featuring earl !
earl !
oh , a @-@ am i still here ?
in my mind , i was running so fast .
earl ... we &apos;re waiting for you .
he &apos;s acting like the stage
wants him to commit to a monogamous relationship .
you know what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about , right , ladies ?
yeah , jazz is funny !
boys , y &apos;all know the drill . vamp ! vamp , boys , vamp .
you gotta go up and buy us some time
so i can convince earl to get up there .
max , i don &apos;t know if i could do that .
should i go with &quot; god bless the child &quot;
or &quot; lady sings the blues &quot; ?
quit adding white things to you .
you &apos;re already the whitest person here .
just go .
hey , there , you crazy cats .
earl will be out in a hot second .
how y &apos;all doin &apos; ?
and @-@ a one , and @-@ a two , and @-@ a three ...
martinis over on this table !
you know when someone else says something stupid ,
but you &apos;re embarrassed ?
earl , i thought this would make you happy ,
but if you don &apos;t wanna play , we can just go .
then let &apos;s just go .
damn it , earl !
follow along , boys .
just keep it bright and breezy ,
and &quot; god bless the child . &quot;
is this a joke ?
i &apos;m gonna have to shoot up myself to get through this .
sometimes when the crickets start chirpin &apos; down south
late on a summer &apos;s night ...
seriously-- is this a joke ?
i just have to break into this song .
oh , lord .
somebody shoot me !
you know what , max , it turns out
i don &apos;t need junk to get up there .
i just needed caroline to start singing .
let &apos;s fly , birds .
a @-@ five , six , seven , eight .
thanks for warming them up , darling .
on , earl , i can stay and sing--
we good .
caroline channing , folks .
everybody , thank you all for coming out tonight .
okay , a @-@ one , two , three ...
that is one cool cashier .
he &apos;s still got it !
yes , he does .
all i know is if that white girl had started singin &apos; ,
you were gonna have to hold my hoops !
wow , earl &apos;s been napping pretty much this whole time .
it was a big night for him .
he got back on the horse
without getting back on the horse .
but i &apos;m pretty sure he got back on ruby .
i know he got back on her ,
&apos;cause i had to hold her hoops .
i hate to say this ,
but i &apos;m a little jealous of earl .
he got a chance to do what he &apos;s best at again .
i &apos;m beginning to think i may never get that chance .
aw , were you holding on to hope ?
stop . you have time . earl &apos;s 80 .
you &apos;re only , what , like 50 now ?
max , i really wanted to sing tonight .
fine .
earl , wake up .
damn it .
have i been living on the subway again ?
no . caroline needs you to play .
oh , i don &apos;t think i could sing on the subway .
&quot; god bless the child &quot; in a g.
caroline , you &apos;re not really gonna sing the blues .
i mean , that music &apos;s about suffering ,
the pain of losing everything .
how would a girl like you know about that ?
i lost $ 5 billion .
key of g , you said .
&apos;scuse me--
this girl &apos;s going to sing for you right now .
we don &apos;t want money , so don &apos;t throw a thing .
so everybody listen up .
not you , sir .
i know you &apos;re busy masturbating .
ready ?
