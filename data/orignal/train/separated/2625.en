Ah, good evening, father. You're looking sharp.
Mr. Valmont, the tally.
Moments away.
Gentlemen.
What are the standing totals?
Master Tyler King, $67,800,000.
All bids paid in full.
Master Francis King, $67,400,000
With one account pending for $1.8 million.
You haven't won yet.
I have, and you know it.
The contractual deadline has passed.
The last tally stands.
Mr. Cardini failed to wire funds for his lot.
I'm sorry.
Well, boys, get on with it.
Next time.
I'm sorry. I've got nothing right for you.
If something comes in --
I just need to go back in, okay? I don't care what it is.
I'll take anything.
You don't want to do that.
Sit down.
You got class.
You're the boyfriend. You're the hip, young executive.
That's where the top dollar is.
Anything else, for you, is a sinful waste.
But I don't care.
I don't care about top dollar.
I just need to go back under.
Bud, please. It's me. I can play anything.
Don't tell me that girl got to you.
If you need a palate-cleansing so bad,
I may have something.
How's your German?
I hope you're considering the apartment at the Audrey.
You must stop living like this.
By all means, come right in. Make yourself at home.
Madeline Pratt has been abducted.
What do you care? She almost got us both killed.
Foreplay.
My relationship with Madeline is...nuanced.
Confounding, yet captivating,
she's a singular woman,
And the world is far more interesting with her in it.
What's more, her abductors meet every requisite
that defines inclusion on the blacklist.
The Kings.
The Kings? Of what?
Not "King" as in "King and castle."
Earl King and his two sons, Tyler and Francis,
descendents of a senescent dynasty.
Their forefathers built a fortune
on the backs of British undesirables,
forcing them into decades of indentured servitude --
A tradition that has been passed from generation to generation
that still continues today.
So, what does this have to do with Madeline Pratt?
Madeline has made
a number of well-heeled enemies over the years,
many of whom would pay a handsome price for her head.
If merely saving a woman's life
isn't enough to warrant the bureau's interest,
consider what taking down
a dynasty like the King family would mean.
Every transaction
meticulously recorded for posterity
in the family ledger.
Sometimes, years pass between auctions.
They're never held in the same place twice.
The guest lists are constantly changing.
This is your chance to solve
a century and a half's worth of abductions and thefts
from the Davidoff-Morini Stradivarius
to the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg.
This phone belonged to a boy in the port of Lisbon,
where Madeline was abducted.
Pictures of the kidnapping.
Find the jackals who took Madeline
and they'll inevitably lead you to the Kings.
So, we're going after one blacklister to save another.
Tell me how that makes sense.
Earl King and his two sons, Tyler and Francis --
From available intel, they appear to be
an eccentric family of trust-fund billionaires.
According to Reddington,
they supplement their family fortune
with profits from their illegal auctions.
Six months ago,
22 pounds of yellowcake uranium seized by MI5
disappeared from their evidence vault in Leeds.
The painting --
stolen from the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam.
Reddington claims
both these items will fall under the gavel
at the Kings' next auction.
I think I might have something.
I isolated this image from the pics,
fan it against our known-tattoo database,
and got a hit.
Silvio Haratz, a Brazilian-born kidnapper
working the world's K&R hotspots.
If the auction's gonna be held on U.S. soil,
Haratz is headed here.
We're gonna need local intel.
The D.O.J. has an active file on Haratz,
but it's restricted access.
I can't open it without throwing up red flags
in the attorney general's office.
I may know someone who can help.
The rest of you, dig up anything you can on the Kings.
What do you have on Haratz?
Enough to haul him in, but not enough to make it stick.
That's all I can say. We're building a case.
I have a good friend,
C.E.O. of a med-tech company.
Got himself mixed up in a fraud scheme.
The grand jury convened,
and it's looking like there's going to be an indictment.
They'll seize his assets.
It would be nice if he had a chance
to shield a little something in a blind trust for his kids.
You want me to tip him off?
He's a good friend, close friend.
And I take care of my friends.
How's that clinical trial?
The one I got you into?
You look well.
Agent Keen.
Hello.
The suspect's name is Silvio Haratz.
He's using a safe house called the Palace.
We're on our way.
No. I know the Palace.
You people get within a mile of that place, he'll be made.
I'll handle it.
Forget it, Reddington.
We're not on your payroll, and you can't call us off.
We're on it.
How much do you want for her?
You can have her.
Sorry, Dembe.
Well-played, Madeline.
Payback for my little gambit last year, I presume.
Consider us even.
Raymond "Red" Reddington.
Lot number 11.
Beautiful.
Careful there, boys.
You don't want to bruise the merchandise.
We intercepted Dembe.
He informed us they used Pratt as bait,
faked the kidnapping
in order to bring Red into the Kings' custody.
King family auctions
are all about providing criminals with items of value.
What's more valuable than Reddington?
Where are we on potential auction locations?
The Kings have real-estate holdings all over the world.
You'd have to be invited to know where this thing is.
Let's not focus on the Kings.
Let's focus on the Kings' guests.
Try and match the items we know they have for sale
with the people who might be interested in buying them.
We'll put together a list.
Alert immigration and the TSA on major points of entry.
Identify and report only. Do not detain.
Your insistence on not speaking, sir,
is making a tedious exercise ever so much worse.
Over here, gentlemen.
Please.
Someone help me.
Raymond Reddington in the flesh.
You must be Tyler.
I hope you're not as short-sighted as your brother.
I could be one of your most valued customers.
As I recall, you're one of the few prospects
who rejected an invitation to our auction.
Nice try, though.
I haven't even begun to try.
There is one thing about your family
that's always intrigued me.
Statistically, 65% of inherited fortunes
are frittered away by the second generation.
90% by the third.
How is it that the Kings
have successfully defied that trend?
You must tell me your secret.
Winner takes all.
And the loser?
None of your business.
Really, I'm all for being thorough,
but at this point, you're just taking the nickel tour.
Alexi Koskov,
a Russian oligarch with an extensive collection
of stolen masterpieces.
The art crime division says
he's been trying to acquire the Van Gogh
since it disappeared in 2002.
Koskov's on the no-fly list. How can he get into the country?
He can't.
But his new acquisitions emissary,
Josephine Sullivan,
flew in from L.A. this morning.
She just checked in to the Vanguard.
Bring her in.
I presume you've been downstairs.
I have.
Reddington's a game changer.
You can't win.
I have no intention of quitting now.
Even if you win,
I only have a 16% chance of losing -- one in six.
We know you're working as a representative for Alexi Koskov
to authenticate and purchase a stolen painting
from an illegal auction.
As such, we can charge you as an accessory after the fact,
not only for the Van Gogh,
but for every crime the King family has committed
to acquire the rest of their stock,
including kidnapping and false imprisonment.
This is the bureau's file on you and your boss.
Koskov is untouchable.
But you're right here.
Her instructions were to introduce herself
to the concierge at the Harleston Read Hotel.
Owned by the King family trust.
Everyone there is on their payroll.
That's it?
She's supposed to ask for a room with a view of the Capitol.
Then what?
She'd get a room number.
After that, no idea.
She's never attended the auction.
Beyond the hotel and the password, we have nothing.
That's not necessarily true.
They're expecting an American named Josephine Sullivan.
We can give them that.
Undercover? Forget it.
I know you want him back, but there has to be another way.
If you can think of one, I'm all ears.
Okay. We do it.
But only as far as the hotel.
Go there. Get what you can.
I'll have a tac team standing by to hit the auction
as soon as you give us a location.
Keen.
It's me.
What the hell are you doing calling me?
Got a new assignment. I'm going away for a while.
What's her name?
It's not like that.
It's not -- - Me?
Yeah. I mean, no. I mean, it's --
It's, uh -- how you been?
What do you think?
I'm in a lot of trouble because of you.
So, what? That's it?
Berlin is out of commission, and you just...get another gig?
Going away for a long time, and I thought I'd...
I don't know. I just wanted to say...
I think the word you're looking for is goodbye.
Look, I got to go.
It seems like the only thing we have in common anymore
is pretending to be someone else.
Wait. You're going undercover?
For how long?
Just a few hours.
Just keep your ears open. Try not to talk too much.
Somebody asks you something,
like some little thing that you don't know,
and you think it's gonna trip you up, just sneeze.
Sneeze?
Yeah. They'll say "Gesundheit"
or "God bless you" or whatever,
and 10 out of 10 times,
they'll forget what they asked you.
I always thought you just had allergies.
Goodbye, Liz.
You'll need this for the elevator.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
She should have a tracker, coms at least.
She's going in blind.
She can handle it.
She's in.
I have a reservation.
Sullivan. Josephine Sullivan.
Of course, Ms. Sullivan.
We have you in a one-bedroom suite.
With a view.
Excuse me?
I requested a view of the Capitol.
That can be arranged.
1861. Last elevator on the left.
1861.
She's in elevator one. I repeat -- elevator one.
Phone, purse, jewelry.
She's going down.
I repeat -- she's going down.
Get a visual!
Welcome, Ms. Sullivan.
Thank you.
1861.
It wasn't a hotel room. It was a parking space.
Drink.
What is it?
Drink.
Good heavens, Earl.
You've never had any feeling in your heart,
but now it looks like
there isn't much going on below the waist.
I do all right.
The wheelchair is just a little memento
of our time together in Bolivia.
No hard feelings, I trust.
Just a few.
But this is only business, Red.
Besides, you warned me.
Pigs eat...
Hogs get slaughtered.
All you had to do was listen.
But that's always been your problem --
all that money clogging your ears.
I told you to come with me that night out on the altiplano.
I had millions invested.
I couldn't just walk away like you.
Poor choice of words given what those soldiers did to you.
I'd hate to see you play the hog yet again, Earl.
No, no, Red.
You taught me an invaluable lesson.
Dispassion
is the businessman's best friend.
One mustn't get emotionally involved in business.
You have to listen to the market.
You hear that?
That's the market
telling me you are in demand.
What kind of a commodity are you?
A wealth of secrets and information?
Or are you an impulse purchase
for a buyer to settle a score?
You scare people, Red.
How much would you pay
to be rid of your deepest fear?
I've always found fear to be my most valuable sense.
But then again, you Kings demonstrate
a propensity for having more dollars than sense.
Your son Tyler was telling me --
"Winner takes all," I believe he said.
I'm curious strictly from an estate-planning perspective.
What exactly does that mean?
Good evening, Ms. Sullivan.
Take what you want
from the family collection --
anything you need.
We want you to feel beautiful.
How thoughtful.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Vicarage.
I would like to thank you
for traveling many a weary mile
to join us on this very special evening.
As is customary,
you will have 30 minutes
to spend among the lots --
a taste to whet your appetite
and loosen your purse strings.
It begins.
Hello...
Vincent.
See something you like?
Little Vincent Peretti, Ms. Sullivan,
of the Peretti family.
Big Vince has turned state's evidence.
There are half a dozen Serbians and Sicilians
willing to pay dearly
for the leverage to insure his silence.
So, I understand you're here on behalf of Mr. Koskov.
Yes, I am.
It's rumored Van Gogh actually painted it at the beach,
and up close,
you can see the grains of sand bonded to the canvas.
Remarkable.
So, which Ivy League did you attend?
It's no secret Alexi fancies a certain breed.
Columbia, then Princeton.
Really? I'm a Princeton man.
The Dinky was such fun, wasn't it?
Bless you.
Oh, the Dinky.
No matter the time of day,
that damn train is always full
of hungover frat boys and co-eds
in the throes of morning-after regret.
Is that who I think it is?
Well, I can see that you are a woman of good taste.
Tyler, I believe the Sheikh has questions
about your guidance chips.
The Raymond Reddington.
Impossible.
You've changed your hair.
You know each other.
Unfortunately.
Perhaps you'd like to make a bid.
I've heard he's far more trouble than he's worth.
It's probably easier to let someone else buy him.
Let him be their problem.
I'm here for the Van Gogh.
He's probably out of my price range, anyway.
Not mine.
Yaabari.
How are the boys?
They still tell tales of the man in the hat
who burned down our compound.
I must say, you've come up in the world,
depending on how you look at it.
How did you manage to wrangle an invitation?
Who's backing you?
I'll see you after the auction.
Just give us the location.
I don't know anything. I'm a hotel employee.
I arrange transportation.
I was doing my job.
Your job is to shuttle people back and forth
to the King family auction.
That woman you sent off in the limo?
She's a federal agent who was investigating a crime
to which you are now an accessory.
If anything happens to her, you'll be facing felony charges.
I told you.
I don't know anything.
The indictment -- it's coming down tonight.
You and I never had this conversation.
Sir, uh, we may have a problem.
I was checking with D.O.C.
on Josephine's transfer to Hazelton.
They allowed her to make a call to her lawyer.
I gave an order.
If she gets word to her people, Keen's cover is blown.
Get D.O.C. On the line now!
Anybody to bid? Now $3 million. Who'll give me $3 million?
I've got $3 million here. Who will give me $4 million?
Give me $4 million? I got $4 million here.
For the bid now $4.25 million?
$4 million going once, going twice.
Sold for $4 million to the gentleman from Maldives.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
one of the most exciting items of the night,
a mainstay on the FBI's most wanted list,
this gentleman has been on the list
longer than any other criminal!
A former naval intelligence officer,
he possesses a wealth of classified information
and presides over one of the world's
most prosperous extralegal empires.
You may know him as the concierge of crime.
I present Raymond Reddington.
I will commence the bidding at $2 million.
Able to bid now $2 million. Who will give me $2 million?
I've got $2 million right here. Who will give me $2.5 million?
Able to bid now $2.5 million.
Thank you, ma'am. Able to bid now $3 million.
Well, that's unexpected, but welcome.
What is she doing?
She's supposed to be here for my Van Gogh.
Thank you, sir. Give me $5 million.
Able to bid now $5 million.
Thank you in the back. I got $5 million.
Give me $6 million.
Able to bid now $6 million. Thank you, sir.
Able to bid now $7 million? Able to bid now $7 million?
It's only money, folks. Able to bid now $7 million.
I'll take it, ma'am. Thank you.
Able to bid now $8 million.
Sir, Mr. Koskov called.
The woman who says she's his emissary --
Mr. Koskov said she's an impostor.
I knew it.
Able to bid now $9 million.
Bring her to me.
Yes, sir.
It's only money, folks.
Who will give me $9 million?
$9 million.
I beg your pardon?
$9 million.
I assume my money's good here.
$10 million!
Certainly as good as his. $15 million.
$16 million.
Come on.
I got to be worth as much
as that fake Xuande Ming vessel was.
$17 million.
$18 million!
Sorry, Santos,
but those cat's eye chrysoberyls are brown, not green.
An expensive forgery, but a forgery nonetheless.
$20 million!
Ignore that bid!
That hardly seems fair.
Get him off the stage now!
Does the gentlemen maintain his previous bid of $18 million?
You're leaving money on the table.
What kind of business are you running here, Earl?
$18 million going once, going twice,
sold for $18 million to the gentleman from Cameroon!
Give us the room.
Sir?
Now, Agent Ressler.
I don't think you quite understand the situation.
You're assuming that you're a material witness
in federal custody
and are entitled to certain rights.
And while these things are true,
what you don't know... is you don't know me.
My doctors recently detected a mass
within the left hemisphere of my brain --
an inoperable tumor.
Within a matter of weeks, it will kill me.
And this has clarified a number of priorities for me.
Among those priorities,
nothing is more important to me
than the safety of my colleagues.
I'm committed that no one under my command
dies during the remainder of my watch.
And I will do anything within my power
to honor that commitment.
And since I quite literally have nothing to lose...
I suggest you think long and hard
before answering my question.
Where is Elizabeth Keen?
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the Van Gogh. I paid a fortune for it.
All items are held till the end of the auction.
You need to --
Come on. I'm getting you out of here.
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay right here, okay?
Take me with you -- please!
We have to get these people out of here.
How do you open this thing?
Lizzy, you need to go.
Damn it! What's the code?
Listen to me.
I was brought in through a series of tunnels that way.
If you hurry, you'll be miles away
before they ever realize you're gone.
Take the boy and go.
You could be killed.
She's off the main floor. Split up.
Check every room.
Help me!
Lizzy, you did everything you could.
It's time to go.
Go.
Spread out!
We need to find that girl immediately.
Come on.
Okay, get in here. Get in here.
Where the hell's the Peretti boy?
I'm sure your friend with the glass jaw
will enlighten you when he comes to.
What's in this for you?
You wouldn't understand. You're not a King.
Funny.
Your father used to say that exact phrase
as if it somehow excused him from the use of logic.
What's in it for me?
Legacy and the King family fortune.
If this is just about the money, that would be so banal.
I bet your father would trade it all
for one more walk in the park with a good friend.
Tell me...
where are all your good friends now, huh?
If you think there's a soul in this world
loyal to anything but your pocketbook,
then you're the one
who's excused himself from the use of logic.
Your prize.
Let's find that kid!
Vincent, I need you to run through that door.
See it?
Go as far as you can, okay?
You're not coming with me? You can't go back!
Run. Go!
Go!
Yaabari, before you exact your vengeance, consider this --
I could easily provide you
with enough influence and firepower
to crown yourself king.
Isn't it time you stopped running through the forest
playing army with a bunch of kids?
A generous offer,
but I'm here for more than just my vengeance.
I knew it. Who's backing you?
A man in Johannesburg
has put a $40 million bounty on your head.
I plan to collect it.
Good luck.
A lot can happen between here and Johannesburg.
You will not be traveling to Johannesburg.
You are not listening.
I said the bounty is on your head.
We shouldn't be doing this
with that FBI agent loose on the property.
She is clearly working with Reddington.
Why else would she bid so high?
To apprehend him.
Who wants Reddington more than the FBI?
Either way, she'll be found, so stop making excuses.
You know I've got you beaten.
You're getting too emotionally invested.
You realize who you sound like.
Do you remember the first time I beat you at tennis?
That was a long time ago.
I had you at match point three times,
and all three times, I lost in an unforced error.
Then you opened your mouth about how father
would never entrust the estate to a loser.
I aced you on the next serve.
Right here.
Try not to take it personally.
Business is business.
In fact, Raymond, I've always been quite fond of you.
Can't tell you what a comfort that is to me.
Lizzy.
Lizzy.
The handcuff key's in his back pocket.
Okay.
Someone's gonna come back.
We got to get out of here.
This is a fiasco.
That impostor took the place of my invited guest,
she ignored the Van Gogh,
drove up the price for Reddington,
and stole the Peretti boy.
How is this any different from Dubai --
That smuggler from the Orient who had to be ejected?
Cost me $3 million at the deadline,
and I still beat you.
The contractual deadline has passed.
The last tally stands.
Master Francis is the winner.
Father, this is ridiculous. You must call this off.
You know as well as I do. There is no calling it off.
Get on with it.
If that hammer falls on an empty chamber,
you'll be dead before you hit the ground.
Put it down.
Earl.
Someone should have put you out of your misery generations ago.
Oh, my God. What are the odds?
I'll leave the three of you to your own misery.
Avoid the yard, be nice to your cell mate,
and whatever you do, don't eat the franks and beans.
Oh, and I don't need your lousy tux.
I want my clothes back.

Agent Keen says we recovered a ledger full of names
and dates from the King family estate.
Bills of sale are being traced back 200 years.
I'm glad something went well today.
What do you mean?
I'd been overseeing a fraud case
built against a med-tech C.E.O.
I got word this morning he fled.
It's like he knew the indictment was coming.
Nothing that should rain on your parade.
Congratulate your team for me.
You can never do that again.
You're welcome.
I'm serious.
You can...never do that again.
Promise me.
We took down dozens of wanted criminals,
recovered millions of dollars in stolen property,
and saved innocent lives.
I'm not talking about that.
You.
You're talking about you.
You are so damaged.
You can't accept help from anyone.
Has anyone ever helped you?
Is that why you are the way you are?
Because you don't feel deserving of it?
Is that why you can't be vulnerable for a second?
I risked my life for you because I care about you.
Deal with that.
And when someone does something nice,
you're supposed to say, "Thank you."
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But never do it again.
