what is the word for an adult who doesn &apos;t have dinosaur toys in their bedroom ?

i had a big meal on monday .
so that &apos;ll get me straight through the week .
i see what &apos;s going on here .
you do ? -yeah .
you don &apos;t like kathy .
you got me .
you &apos;ve been avoiding her ever since we started going out .
i made an effort to like janice .
now i think it &apos;s your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out with us . right ?
yeah , right .
good . and hey , my treat .
only because you &apos;re not eating , right ?
right .
sorry , grandma .
ross isn &apos;t here .

i &apos;ll see you at the party ?
beer &apos;s fear , man ! twenty @-@ four , seven !
i am so gonna marry that guy .
what ?
i think he &apos;s stealing from me .
why ?
because he &apos;s stealing from me !
hi , it &apos;s me and soup .
i just saw josh . he looked so yummy in your leather jacket .
i don &apos;t eat chicken , so it &apos;s just noodle soup .
there &apos;s no chicken in the broth , so it &apos;s really just noodle water .
thank you so much . -sure .
what are you doing ?
i need your germs . i want my cold back .
i miss my sexy voice .
sorry , phoebe .
it &apos;s okay .
how &apos;s the soup ?
check it out ! you can see that girl &apos;s underwear .
is she great , or what ?
what do you think ?
she &apos;s not really my type .
not your type ? she &apos;s gorgeous .
you know what it is ? the fishnet stockings .
whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings , it reminds me of ...
... my father in fishnet stockings .
understanding a little more of why you &apos;re single .
i have a friend you &apos;d like . she &apos;s really pretty . and then we could double date .
no , thanks .
i &apos;ve got some ugly friends , and they &apos;re all available too .
i &apos;m gonna grab a beer .
i &apos;ll be right back .
what was that ? -what ?
kathy &apos;s being really nice and you just walked away .
i thought we had a deal .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to like her .
if that &apos;s too damn difficult for you , then the least you could do is pretend .
i am pretending .
then do it better .
what do you say i go over there and tell her how much i like her ?
i can tell her how much i &apos;ve been thinking of her .
i haven &apos;t stopped thinking about her since we met .
i &apos;m so over the top , want @-@ to @-@ slit @-@ my @-@ own @-@ throat ...
... in love with her that for every minute ...
... i can &apos;t believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first !
that &apos;s pretty good .
but you might want to tone it down a little .
i still have a fever ? are you sure that thing &apos;s working right ?
well , we could take it the other way .
so amanda just dropped me off .
that &apos;s one of the things i love about her .
she &apos;s old enough to drive .
you &apos;re not going to mom and dad &apos;s tonight ?
no , sorry .
where &apos;s amanda ?
could you get me some cough drops ?
i &apos;m thinking you could bring her ... and you guys could go up to your old room
... and not make out .
cough drop , please ?
at least she &apos;s not going out with me to get into r @-@ rated movies .
why don &apos;t you just marry her ?
wait , you can &apos;t ! i forgot . she &apos;s not a lesbian .
amanda and i have a
you have nothing !
you &apos;re not even going out ! you &apos;re her babysitter .
you have a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s job !
that is so sad .
and what are you laughing at , miss my @-@ keg @-@ sucking @-@ boyfriend ... -is @-@ stealing @-@ from @-@ me ?
so he stole a couple bucks from me . big deal ! at least he got me something with it .
that &apos;s mine !
would you both please start acting like adults ?
and give me my cough drops !
