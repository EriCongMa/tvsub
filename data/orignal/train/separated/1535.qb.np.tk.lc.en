joe , you &apos;re going to see your first snow .
it &apos;s so exciting !
i can &apos;t wait to make a snow person !
&quot; person &quot; ?
we got to get him out of that hippie school .
i don &apos;t know , jay .
last report card , he got straight dolphins .
christmas in colombia was always hot and loud ,
people arguing , betrayal , schemes .
so i rented a mountain cabin for the whole family
to celebrate my first christmas as an american .
i want a white christmas ,
you know , like white people have .
hey , want to hit the pipe one more time
before we get on the road ?
um , yeah . couldn &apos;t hurt .
* silent night *
* holy night *
oh , my god , we are killing it !
last christmas , mitchell and i thought it would be fun
to sing a little christmas carol for the family .
unfortunately , it didn &apos;t go so well
because somebody had a little too much to drink .
stop doing that . i was nervous .
* &apos; tis the season to be jolly *
* don we now our gay apparel *
mitchell ?
the family has been mocking us relentlessly all year .
nicknames like screeches &amp; herb ,
五分钱是一支评价不佳的加拿大乐队
simon &amp; god @-@ awful , nickelback .
but we &apos;re gonna redeem ourselves this year .
we have been rehearsing our new number for months ,
and we will debut it at the cabin
as a special holiday &quot; screw you &quot; to the family .
hey , marty , listen ,
it &apos;s your hotel , but a walnut closet
is a place your guests want to hang their clothes .
a particleboard closet -- they want to hang themselves .
all this closet stuff is driving me nuts .
i want to get annoyed ,
but it &apos;s hard when i feel this comfortable .
oh , god , he &apos;s gonna talk about his new coat again .
it &apos;s like getting a big , warm hug from a mama sheep .
nothing feels like pure sheepskin .
the gal at the store said
i looked like kris kristofferson .
we don &apos;t know who that is .
i have so much lab homework
to get done during this break .
if it were up to me ,
christmas wouldn &apos;t even come this year .
any chance you could sound more like a cartoon villain ?
come on , alex , it &apos;s three solid days of winter fun .
we &apos;re gonna go sledding , skating ,
ice @-@ fishing , make snow angels .
who &apos;s with me ? ! snow , snow !
snow , snow , snow , snow , snow , snow , snow !
snow ?
no , that &apos;s a leaf .
it &apos;s hotter here than at home .
gloria , in your little daily e @-@ mails ,
you said it was gonna be cold .
that &apos;s what my phone said .
you &apos;re on celsius .
it &apos;s going to be hot , guys !
oh , is the furnace on ? !
phil , take off that jacket .
you &apos;re making me hot just looking at you .
saleslady said that would happen .
trust me , i &apos;m cool as cucumber .
something about the coat just knows what my body needs .
you &apos;re sweating like a heroin addict .
oh , hey , look , a piano .
maybe we can get a little song from the crapenters .
be cool .
andy &apos;s fiancee , beth , has to work ,
so gloria invited him for christmas ,
which is complicated
because we &apos;ve been having sex and nobody knows about it .
i mean , we know .
my family cannot find out about us .
i &apos;m certainly not gonna tell them .
i still have their respect .
andy , chop @-@ chop . joe &apos;s making his bathroom face .
all right , let &apos;s just go home .
i mean , it &apos;s hot . there &apos;s no wi @-@ fi .
alex , stop being the grinch .
if that is the worst problem , then merry christmas .
oh , thank god you made it !
i thought you &apos;d gotten into a horrible car accident !
wait a second .
you &apos;re not trip , tad , lois , darcy , and marlene .
no , we &apos;re other names .
who are you ?
fig wilson .
my family &apos;s been coming here for the holidays for years .
we rented this cabin from the wilsons .
they are in hawaii .
nobody told me that .
okay , well , bye @-@ bye .
how could they abandon me ?
uh , i &apos;m the most caring one in the family .
i warn them about cancer .
i buy their fat kids clothes in aspirational sizes .
i invite them all to my dogs &apos; funerals .
last one ran straight into traffic .
i can see that .
is it possible the invitation got lost ?
i mean ... you seem great .
well , i guess i &apos;ll just get my bags and walk down the hill .
hopefully , i &apos;ll get to the bus station before nightfall .
it &apos;s wolf season .
why don &apos;t you stay here with us ?
it &apos;s christmas .
first time i saw you ,
i thought you were gonna be a pain in the ass ,
but it turns out you &apos;re my favorite .
what do you think &apos;s in here ?
no one told you the legend of the forgotten boy ?
happened right here 100 years ago .
a boy was very bad ,
and his parents locked him in this secret room
and left him here forever .
they say at night , you can hear him
trying to scratch his way out .
we got her .
idiots .
that was you scratching , right ?
oh , sorry .
no , you go .
no , it &apos;s okay . after you .
here , i &apos;ll just ...
oh , why don &apos;t i go ...
what are you guys doing -- having a staring contest ?
i got winners !
later , though . come here .
andy ...
i &apos;ve got a very special present for you .
did this guy tell you he passed his real @-@ estate @-@ license test ?
i know . i helped him cram .
ah , she &apos;s really drilling me pretty hard .
cool . listen , when i first got into real estate ,
i worked at one of those big firms with the blazers .
i &apos;d rather not say their name ,
but it rhymed with &quot; century not very fun . &quot;
anyway , i saved this .
i &apos;d like for you to have it .
when you wear it , remember the values of our profession --
trust , honor , integrity , fidelity , and purity .
are you worthy of the blazer , andy ?
i want to be .
i didn &apos;t expect it to hit this hard .
me either .
who wants eggnog ?
i &apos;ll take some . i had a tough week at work .
what do you do ?
oh , my dad and i are in the closet business .
i &apos;m sorry , it almost sounded like you said , &quot; closet business . &quot;
i did -- residential and hospitality storage solutions .
yikes .
hey , specks , i &apos;m dying over there .
what are you reading ?
science stuff . i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll bore you .
i teach astrophysics at m.i.t.
wait a minute .
are you f.n. wilson ?
f @-@ n right , i am !
we just read your essay on how solar flares
will wipe out life on earth !
hopefully before closet lady corners me again .
everybody &apos;s here ,
so let &apos;s just casually
make our way over to the piano .
ooh , what are we drinking there , miss scarlet ?
relax . it &apos;s hot tea for my throat .
oh , we should have lily film us .
hey , lily , come here .
okay , so , daddy and i are about
to sing a christmas song , and --
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
no , it &apos;s not gonna be like last year
because we &apos;re prepared and we &apos;re singing &quot; silent night . &quot;
that &apos;s my favorite . can i sing with you ?
can i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
i feel so lucky celebrating
with the best damn family any man could hope for .
dad .
and fig .
hey , all !
gloria and i have been talking about this for a while .
what with joe getting older ,
i feel it &apos;s just the right time to start a new chapter ,
which is why i &apos;ve decided ... to retire .
oh , my .
what ? !
maybe &quot; retired &quot; is the wrong word --
more of a transition .
so , when people ask , &quot; where &apos;s jay pritchett ? &quot;
you tell them , &quot; he &apos;s transitioning . &quot;
oay , i heard it , too .
let &apos;s go back to retiring .
hey , we can finally rent that r.v.
and visit all of the major league ballparks .
you can probably go ahead and do that alone .
uh , anyway , i had to ask myself ,
&quot; who &apos;s the best person to lead the company ? &quot;
and the answer is obvious .
chuck feeny .
who ?
gutters and screen hot shot out of chicago .
with him in charge ,
we can all relax knowing that the company is in good hands .
claire gets a great new boss .
and you all get to spend more time with yours truly .
well , to this one &apos;s new boss .
claire , that &apos;s my gesturing hand .
i need it for work .
i work 60 @-@ hour weeks so chuck feeny can have
the corner office and the best table at closet con !
honey , you need to slow down .
this coat isn &apos;t quite broken in yet .
listen , you have every right to be mad .
everyone knows you deserve that job .
and to think of all the weekends i worked
and the -- the family vacations we &apos;ve put off ,
not to mention the stress and the insomnia and --
come here .
claire , life &apos;s like a mountain road ...
with a new adventure around every corner .
if that &apos;s the slogan for this stupid coat ,
i &apos;m gonna kill you !
shh ! get in here .
have you seen claire ?
no .
i told you this chuck feeny thing was a terrible idea !
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
there is no chuck feeny .
i made him up because of what happened to don mcsorley
when he turned his company over to his son .
son only took the job because he felt obligated .
one year later , business went bankrupt .
broke my heart to buy his entire inventory
8 cents on the dollar .
i &apos;m doing this for claire .
she &apos;d do anything to make me happy ,
and that &apos;s not why i want her to take the job .
if she wants it , she &apos;ll fight for it .
if not , i just gave her an easy out .
i can think of 10 better ways to do this .
relax . it &apos;s gonna be perfect .
she &apos;ll come to me , demand what &apos;s hers .
i &apos;ll tell her the truth , big hug , perfect christmas .
i &apos;m a genius .
you &apos;re a crazy person .
in my village , we will tie a tin can around your neck
to know when you &apos;re coming .
* silent night *
* holy night *
* all is calm *
* all is bright *
* &apos; round yon virgin mother and child *
okay , hey , hey , i have a fun idea !
why don &apos;t we give lily one of her presents right now ?
that is a fun idea , daddy .
then she can go play with a toy
rather than being with us boring , old adults .
how &apos;s that sound , lily ?
i feel like you &apos;re up to something , but i don &apos;t care .
i want a present . i &apos;ll take the bike @-@ shaped one .
nice wrapping job , by the way .
uh , wasn &apos;t that for joe ?
well , joe &apos;s getting a doll now .
gloria asked me to get some kindling .
why are you walking around wearing next to nothing ?
it &apos;s 26 celsius out there .
ah , i &apos;m not showing any skin
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to tempt you .
oh , well , your gold blazer took care of that .
you know you &apos;re into it .
i know . why ?
damn you and that eagle scout smile .
i want to take a swim in those big doe eyes .
this is happening .
getting wood , andy ?
what ? !
can you believe gloria wants a traditional fire ?
as if it isn &apos;t hot enough in here .
come on , bro .
hello , lily .
what are you wearing ?
mom made us put on our christmas sweaters ,
but look what we found .
it &apos;s a note .
&quot; i &apos;m hungry for the blood of a little girl . &quot;
&quot; signed , the forgotten boy . &quot;
this is terrifying .
it &apos;s getting real .
the scariest thing is that he spells like a 2 @-@ year @-@ old .
wait , what ?
dude .
christmas , huh ?
who the hell came up with this one ?
it was emperor constantine .
i love it !
it &apos;s not easy being the smartest person in the room .
my sister thinks quantum theory is a game show ,
and my brother once tried to take his pants off over his head .
gals like us , we see through all the family b.s ..
we call it like we see it .
so , if we &apos;re alone for christmas
and birthdays and weekends , it &apos;s their loss .
gals like us we don &apos;t need anyone .
i &apos;m not big on mysticism , but , clearly ,
this woman was my ghost of christmas future .
so , i decided to turn things around
and jump in on the holiday spirit .
jump aboard the fun train !
that was a train .
something smells good !
what ? what doesn &apos;t smell good ?
no , i @-@ i said it did .
i am confused ! what is it that you don &apos;t like ? !
i &apos;m just excited for dinner . i love you guys .
oh , don &apos;t be nasty . we &apos;re trying our best .
yes !
hey , look what i found -- a key to that secret room .
my entire family is here .
do you have any idea how dangerous that is ?
meet me in two minutes .
there she is .
haven &apos;t seen you since my big announcement .
what do you think ?
i think that i gave my all to this company
and that if you were gonna hand over the reins to somebody ,
it should be me and not some hump from chicago !
well , it just so happens --
i &apos;m not finished , dad !
thank you for saving me
from wasting the next 20 years of my life
talking about slats , rods , and hinges --
from becoming the most boring person
in the most boring industry on earth !
&quot; boring &quot; ? !
boring !
closets bring order to a chaotic world !
what happened ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
i raised a mean , ungrateful daughter ,
and i &apos;m glad i gave the business to chuck feeny !
there is no chuck feeny !
manny , luke , knock it off !
no one thinks it &apos;s funny !
are you talking to us ?
hey , as long as everybody &apos;s just sitting around , uh --
oh , they &apos;re gonna do another one !
thank you , santa claus !
that &apos;s hilarious .
hope you &apos;re having fun , &apos; cause that &apos;s about to end .
okay , stick to the scripted patter , sweetie .
and a one and a two .
* silent night *
oh , my god , what was that ?
oh , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
fine . it &apos;s no big deal .
so , mitchell , here we go again .
* silent night *
that is your daughter screaming !
lily , are you okay ? !
what &apos;s going on ? !
the forgotten boy -- i heard him ! he &apos;s in there !
of course he is .
all right , let &apos;s get him out , huh ?
we &apos;ll make sure that he doesn &apos;t bother -- - oh , god !
oh , god !
andy ?
take off the blazer .
we were just looking for dinner napkins .
where ? in her shirt ?
i have so many questions .
boys , lily , go play where snow would be .
so , is this a thing ?
is it the first time ?
no .
yes !
andy !
i @-@ i &apos;m sick of the lies .
we &apos;ve been having improper relations .
aren &apos;t you engaged ?
oh , suddenly , you &apos;re concerned about loyalty .
oh , you &apos;re talking to me . won &apos;t that bore you ?
apparently , i &apos;m boring !
listen , everyone ,
let &apos;s not let this ruin our beautiful holiday .
alex , nobody needs your sarcasm right now !
it &apos;s ugly , honey .
this is andy and haley &apos;s private business .
i think we should be focused on this special night .
this special silent night .
one and a two .
* silent night *
* hol-- *
guys , i have a surprise !
it &apos;s beth !
oh , my god .
this is one of my christmas surprises .
andy , you can spend christmas with your fiancé after all !
hi , bittle @-@ battle !
hey , pumpkin !
beth , you mind if i have a quick chitchat with your man ?
yeah , i &apos;ll give beth a tour of the house
while we get gloria up to speed .
don &apos;t you just love the holidays ?
full of wonder and magic and surprise and --
what ? !
sit .
mr. dunphy , i am s--
it &apos;s not your turn to talk .
that &apos;s my daughter , and you &apos;re engaged to someone else .
if this is a fling , it &apos;s over . you understand me ?
but if this is something real ,
you need to be honest with beth .
it &apos;s time to step up and be a man .
i understand .
let me tell you something .
life is like a mountain road
with a new adventure around every corner .
right ?
did you just think of that ?
i did .
seems tense .
your big sis is kind of a disaster , huh ?
fig , we are a lot alike , like you said .
and sometimes we can give off
a negative vibe without meaning to .
what &apos;s your point ?
well , i was thinking maybe we could make more of an effort
to be more positive and actually enjoy christmas .
as a goof ?
okay , all right , new plan .
we wait until the whole haley / andy thing blows over .
everyone gets a little liquored up .
other people .
and then , right before dessert , you sit down at the piano .
* silent night *
what the hell is that ?
* holy night *
* all is calm *
* all is bright *
* round yon virgin mother and child *
son of a bitch !
mother ...
* holy infant , so tender and mild *
* sleep in heavenly peace *
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m drinking .
* sleep in heavenly peace *
that &apos;s got to hurt !
hey , zucchini blossom !
hey , popcorn shrimp , listen .
something is going on , and ...
as painful as it may be , i think we should talk about it .
you could always see through me .
what now ?
yes , i met someone .
i &apos;ve been dating him for a few months behind your back .
and i &apos;m actually cheating on him , too .
you mean with me ?
no !
no .
popcorn shrimp .
well , slight change of plans .
i &apos;m gonna be going .
merry christmas , everyone .
bye , beth !
drive safe !
keep in touch !
i don &apos;t see us keeping in touch .
hey , you broke up with beth ?
she cheated on me . i can &apos;t believe it .
wait , you &apos;re upset ?
of course i &apos;m upset .
we dated for 10 years .
i just got stabbed in the back .
welcome to the club .
really ?
you were stabbed in the back ?
a daughter mocking her father &apos;s life .
closets aren &apos;t fascinating ? since when ?
want to talk about betrayal ?
how about when somebody steals a song
and takes it for themselveses ?
i had no idea that you guys were gonna sing that song .
i did . i heard them rehearsing .
i thought there was an animal stuck in the wall .
and to think we invited you into our home .
we should &apos;ve left you out in the warm .
i get that you &apos;re upset , but remember ,
i even liked you when you were fat .
they give out awards to people like me !
i gave up a three @-@ day trip to cabo
to close that best western deal .
that &apos;s right . you owe her 25 margaritas !
phil !
21 !
21 !
enough , enough , enough !
all i wanted was a white christmas ,
and instead , i &apos;m back in colombia --
the heat , the betrayal , people stealing songs !
this ends now !
andy , stop whining and be grateful that haley likes you !
she &apos;s a stone @-@ cold 10 , and you &apos;re a utah 7 !
jay , it &apos;s time for you and caire to kiss and make up !
why doesn &apos;t he kiss chuck feeny ? !
because there &apos;s no chuck feeny !
he made it up to test you !
and if she didn &apos;t care , she wouldn &apos;t be this upset !
there is no chuck feeny ?
it was a dumb idea ,
but i saw what happened to don mcsorley !
the crackerjack blinds guy .
you got his whole company for 8 cents on the dollar .
i bought his photocopier for 7 bucks .
i always hoped you &apos;d take over the company .
there &apos;s no one i trust more than you .
i just had to know that you really wanted it !
that i wanted to run a company that gives people a place
to store not only their jeans , but their dreams ?
yes !
here .
i got you a little early christmas present .
&quot; claire dunphy , c.e.o. &quot;
oh , you !
that &apos;s more like it !
who cares what the weather is ?
what is important is that we have each other !
snow !
good king wenceslas , there is snow !
i told you everything was going to work out .
it &apos;s a perfect christmas .
what are we looking at ?
snow !
our miracle for christmas .
that &apos;s not snow .
that &apos;s ashes from a forest fire .
if you &apos;re quiet , you can hear screaming .
phil , did you look in all the drawers ?
yep , and under the bed . got everything .
bye , gloria . thank you .
bye .
jay , don &apos;t forget joe &apos;s new doll .
mitch and cam -- always pushing their agenda .
bye @-@ bye , house !
we will miss you !
hello ?
hello ? !
i @-@ it &apos;s me -- luke !
i think i locked myself in here !
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m alone here .
