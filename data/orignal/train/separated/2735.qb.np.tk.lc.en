nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the american public .
the ancient egyptians
postulated seven souls .
the top soul and the first to leave at the moment of death
is ren : the secret name .
this corresponds to my director .
he directs the film of your life
from conception
to death .
&quot; the secret name &quot; is the title of your film .
when you die , that &apos;s where ren came in .
second soul and second one
off the sinking ship is sekem :
energy , power , light .
the director gives the orders ,
sekem presses the right buttons .
number three is khu : the guardian angel .
he , she or it is third man out .
number four is ba : the heart--
often treacherous .
number five is ka : the double .
the ka , which usually reaches adolescence
at the time of bodily death ,
is the only reliable guide through the land of the dead .
who &apos;s gonna live here ?
a family .
i &apos;ll have it finished by october .
i &apos;m worried , ade .
everybody &apos;s worried .
no . i am worried all the time .
number six is khaibit :
the shadow , memory ,
your whole past conditioning
from this and other lives .
number seven is sekhu :
the remains .
i &apos;m halfway to china . there &apos;s nothing here .
40 , 000 i had--
my share of the bohack &apos;s haul from the &apos; 70s .
did you wrap it right ? it gets moldy-- it could &apos;ve disintegrated .
wrap what ?
the money .
he knows i need that money for my fucking retrial !
who ?
you know who .
no , i don &apos;t know who . that &apos;s why i asked you .
malanga .
will you stop with that ?
pussy malanga &apos;s dead six years now .
i should dig him up already !
moles .
they chewing through your sprinklers too ?
40 , 000 i had--
my share of the bohack &apos;s haul from the &apos; 70s .
we &apos;ll look later . you &apos;re gonna be late for your doctor &apos;s . come on . hello ?
let me ask you something : ls your time more valuable than mine ?
where &apos;s the baby ?

the man is not competent , tony .

he &apos;s got legal bills up the ass .
he can sell this museum and move to green grove .
fuck assisted living , okay ?
remember what they did to ma ?
she was thriving there , tony .
he stays where he is , janice .
he &apos;s our uncle . it &apos;s the least we can do .
so the split , your friend in jersey
says it should be the same as the old business we do over there .
that &apos;s public works , this isn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll hold the line .
don &apos;t turn it into world war lll .
so day to day , how are you getting along with tony ?

oh , for the love of mike !
this is pine , sir-- utility grade .
i know what it is . i &apos;ve been building houses for years .
then you know that the code calls for doug fir grade ,
stamped for all floor joists , ceiling joists , lintels and rafters .

pudgie walsh retired , sir .
i &apos;m affirming the stop @-@ work order .
oh , come on !
ls there nothing else we can do ?
for god &apos;s sake !
you can schedule a further appeal . but if i were you ,
i &apos;d think about starting over with the proper lumber .
god , 15 times i asked you !
do you know what this does to my cost basis ,
to start over with this ?
it &apos;s bureaucratic bullshit !
ln my day , they &apos;d turn a blind eye .
i hired you to do a job !
hired ? i &apos;m not for hire .
you presented this like we were partners .
you don &apos;t listen to anybody , do you ?

sorry .
everything &apos;s so fucking morbid .
there &apos;s a man lying dead over there .
i &apos;m gonna go smoke .
hey , tony .
hey .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
for you . your taste .
the inheritance .
i didn &apos;t want to say nothing ,
with your aunt and all , but this is thoughtful .

fucking captain ,

no wonder the papers are calling this &quot; the year of the rat . &quot;
standup guys like that ,
they &apos;re a dying breed .
amen to that .
what can you do ?
anyway , let me go pay my respects .
all right , rusty .
you okay ?
i gotta get out of here .
he &apos;s thinking about it . what do you want me to tell you ?
how many years have we dreamt about this , to get out of this shit ?
every time someone we know gets arrested--
i know . will you stop ?
i &apos;m worried , gene . we &apos;ve already made the offer .
i &apos;m doing everything i can .
why are you fighting ?
we &apos;re not fighting , sweetie . we &apos;re talking .
how come you &apos;re not in bed , hmm ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i &apos;m saying is , he has to see this is a huge opportunity for us .
give the man time to process .
oh my god , this eel is delicious .
okay , spanish mackerel now .
can i get another sake , hon &apos; ?
listen , i got some stuff i gotta take care of .
you okay to drive yourself home ?
i don &apos;t have my car , tony .
oh , yeah . so take this one .
hey , mrs. s.
what is this ?
oh my god .
ls this the new porsche ?
cayenne turbo . i got the 4 . 5 @-@ liter v @-@ 8 .
wasn &apos;t sure about the color , so i took a shot .
tony , i love it . it &apos;s gorgeous !
i still wish you &apos;d talked to that guy at the building department ,
but oh my god ! what a car !
ho , joe college , where &apos;s your mother ?
she went to the outlet stores with aunt ro .
ls that the jacket we got you for christmas ?
i &apos;m lending it to matt .
hey , how was the interview for the internship ?
got moved to next week .
would you mind keeping me in the loop , though , since it was
my lawyer that set it up , huh ? - okay .
matt don &apos;t have his own clothes ?
he &apos;s borrowing it for a party .
oh , good . you &apos;ll never see it again .
you have such a low opinion of people .
let me tell you something , a. j.
i don &apos;t care how close you are ,
in the end , your friends are gonna let you down .
family . they &apos;re the only ones you can depend on .
he was vital , my uncle , alive .
for all his faults , he was sharp in his day .
but now ...
we stopped at a light yesterday ,
and i see this nanny , black girl , pushing a baby carriage .
coming the other way ,
there &apos;s another one
with this old lady in a wheelchair
staring off into space . - the circle of life .
the circle jerk of life . where &apos;s the dignity ?
lf you &apos;re lucky , in the end you can let go of your pride ,
let your loved ones care for you .
i &apos;d rather they hold a pillow over my face .
i find it interesting you would say that .
you tried to smother your mother with a pillow .
what ? - ln the hospital , after her stroke .
the fuck i did !
i grabbed a pillow , but it was ...
just to keep my hands occupied .
have you considered getting your uncle some live @-@ in help ?
we got a girl comes in days , she &apos;s from trinidad .
does he have the means for assisted living ?
did you just say to let your loved ones take care of you ?
lf it &apos;s feasible .
well , he &apos;s my uncle .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
what are we talking about ?
the fact that you still , after all this time ,
cannot accept you had a mother who didn &apos;t love you .
ln pitying your uncle ,
the man she conspired with ,
you &apos;re turning the blame for what she did
back on yourself again , after all this time .
what was your mother like ?
did she ever let you down , hurt your feelings ?
of course she did . she was controlling
and manipulative at times .
she also never tried to kill me .
i pushed her over the edge .
by placing her in a lovely retirement community .
it &apos;s a nursing home !
it &apos;s less hurtful to believe that they were right
to try and destroy you than to accept the fact
that she didn &apos;t value you .
hesh is a personal friend of mine ,
and the kid is his son @-@ in @-@ law .
now i know phil &apos;s got a lot on his plate , but come on .
i &apos;ll talk to john . i was taking my sister there saturday anyway .
how is ginny ? carmela says she &apos;s got her hands full .
the kid has the weight of the world on her .
ray @-@ bans .
classic , affordable .
i just put those on special .
you got something a little more current ?
like those .
armanis . flexible acetate frames ,
rimless lenses .
you know what ? i left my wallet in the car .
i &apos;ll catch you next time .
some people from the lrs came by .
they want to inventory the entire house .
maybe i should sell the car ,
at least get some liquidity out of it .
the maserati ?
can &apos;t say i disagree .
that breaks my fucking heart .
christopher moltisanti came over to the house asking about it .
he &apos;ll pay cash , he said .
there &apos;s something else , john ,
phil related .
the hairdo , he &apos;s in a beef with the jew .
what ? god damn it , what ?
the jew &apos;s son @-@ in @-@ law . it got physical .
your friend from jersey got involved , but he can &apos;t get phil to focus .
do i not have enough on my fucking mind ?
the guy from jersey asked me to tell you .
well , then call phil and have him fucking handle it !
don &apos;t yell at my brother , john . he &apos;s trying to do right by us .
the pictures from allegra &apos;s shower .
noon he said , right ?
passive @-@ aggressive bullshit .
i recognize that in people every time now .
there he is .
ho , finally .
i was starting to grow mushrooms out my ass .
there &apos;s an image .
so gerry filled me in on the way over .
this whole thing was a complete misunderstanding .
yeah , this eli kid , i had any idea he was with you ,
i would have never ... - he didn &apos;t tell you about hesh ?
i asked who he was . he high @-@ handed me . i thought he was a civilian .
still , to get dragged by a car ?
for the record , though , the car thing was a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
so what do we do here ?
what did we say ?
25 sounds right .
he &apos;s bleeding internally . pain , suffering--
so you tell me . 50 ?
yeah , fair enough .
could we segue now into something more pressing ?
the floor is yours , senator .
i spoke to john . the split on the office park is way out of whack .
same thing as the esplanade .
apples and bowling balls , tony . with fuel costs now--
like you &apos;re not passing that on to the drivers ?
65 @-@ 35 . all right .
why you always cave for this prick ?
i &apos;m not caving . it &apos;s a strategy .
johnny &apos;s in jail . you keep him happy ,
he &apos;ll keep a lid on phil .
tony b , phil &apos;s kid brother ,
the bad taste that left with phil--
there are 200 soldiers in his family .
i &apos;m not scared of them .
tony left ? - yeah .
i stopped by stewart &apos;s . i got a whole lunch set up .
did tony mention anything to you about what we talked about ?
about you moving to florida ?
did he say if he &apos;s leaning one way or the other ?
listen , there &apos;s something i need you to do .
i got a call from fritzie up in boston .
there &apos;s a guy named teddy spirodakis , owes some money .
you want me to collect ?
that ship sailed . final notice time .
really ?
you got a problem with that ?
no . i just gotta run it by vito . he &apos;s my captain .
believe me , vito will be down with it .
so this comes from tony ?
it &apos;s coming from me . i &apos;m not a fucking captain ?
all right , okay ?
how soon ?
asap .
like right away .
i &apos;ll call with the details . get it done .
i &apos;ll put in a good word to t. about the florida thing .
the rear deck , didn &apos;t they say that would be refinished ?
that &apos;s the old photo . it &apos;s been completely redone .
the wiring in the pool house ? tell them they can knock
two grand off the price or they can sell to someone else .
listen , you &apos;re responding to their counter .
you should ask for whatever you want .
okay , we &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
all right then , good night .
what do you think ?
that if we lose this house , i &apos;m gonna die .
ton &apos; , what do you want to do for dinner ?
i &apos;ll be right down !
well ...
hey .
your new insurance card .
oh , good .
any thoughts on dinner ?
whatever you like .
i know this is insane , but i can &apos;t stop thinking about nori &apos;s .
i was just there .
today ? with who ?
nobody .
you went there without me ?
yeah , i was hungry .
what ?
nothing .
come on , what ?
i don &apos;t know ,
i just thought that was our special place .
well , it is . well ?
i went there alone , carm .
i know that . you said .
it just felt nice to have something special , for us .
no kids around , without my parents ...
we can go if you want . no , no , don &apos;t be silly .
are you sure ?
how &apos;s the car ?
teddy , right ? yeah . hey !
carmela .
ginny , hi .
i tried calling , but i kept getting the machine .
ls everything all right ? truth is ,
sometimes i don &apos;t answer the phone . goddamn creditors .
i was in the neighborhood . i thought i might kidnap you for a spa date .
well , that &apos;s a nice surprise .
i thought maybe we &apos;d drive up there , maybe stop at occitane .
ls that new ?
oh , the car ? yes , yes .
porsche cayenne , like the pepper .
it &apos;s beautiful , carm .
five minutes
at no incline . then i switch to full uphill for my cardio .
i was telling tony he should come with me .
do him good .
it ain &apos;t just aesthetics , either .
god forbid he ever has a heart attack . yeah .
vito , you &apos;re in the handicapped spot .
that fucking guy is here again ?
the man &apos;s a former judge .
hey , listen to this .
&quot; lf your nose runs and your feet smell--
you &apos;re built upside down . &quot; funny .
hey , by the way , your florida thing ...
tony asked me to speak to you ...
that &apos;s a no @-@ go .
what ?
can &apos;t be accommodated .
you &apos;re part of the team .
but i just did that thing .
that &apos;s not my department .
well , can i talk to tony at least ?
i wouldn &apos;t bother him . he &apos;s out on the new boat .
does he think i &apos;m gonna talk about shit up here ,
with what i &apos;ve done , what i just did ?
it &apos;s not so silly when you think about it .
i &apos;m a top earner now .
it &apos;s not out of the realm of possibility
that i could be the boss of this family one day .
i mean , god forbid tony ever gets ...
cancer , coronary , something like that .
yeah .
hey , big brother .
listen , i know i was supposed to sit with uncle jun &apos; tonight ,
but tom just called from location .
apparently , some smoke effect went awry
and he inhaled noxious chemicals .
well , go . go .
the thing is , uncle jun &apos; doesn &apos;t want me to .
he &apos;s exceptionally agitated today and he &apos;s been nauseous .
well , did you call janice ? i mean , her or bobby should go .
i &apos;m all the way out here on a boat .
they can &apos;t do it .
what do you mean can &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know .
she didn &apos;t elaborate . it didn &apos;t seem like she wanted to .
aw , god damn it !
i &apos;m sorry , tony .
all right , all right , all right .
mother--
i swear to god , i &apos;m throwing all this shit right in the garbage !
it &apos;s my hobby , janice . why do you gotta belittle it ?

i told you last week , we have nica &apos;s preschool meeting .
she &apos;s 15 months old . - no one was more competitive
than your wife when it came to this stuff with a. j.
a lot of good it did .
this child-- constantly wanting the breast .
he doesn &apos;t want to be alone . he says he doesn &apos;t feel good .
the school , they need to meet both parents if it &apos;s an intact family .
so call the girl , the nurse .
miss trinidad ? right . every time i call ,
a different person answers .
i &apos;ll go , ton &apos; . i &apos;m on it .
fuck it ! you wanna get something done , you gotta do it yourself .
you were the one
who was opposed to assisted living .
you and i are gonna talk .
you didn &apos;t have to wear your fucking hat .
shit .
so how about you ? are you dating ?
with my hours at the body shop ?
ladies .
dessert was on me .
thank you , artie .
it &apos;s nice to see you two patch things up .
so silly .
i &apos;m not even sure what happened .
me and tony didn &apos;t speak for months . you pick up right where you left off .
did charmaine tell you ? we &apos;re getting back together .
no , she didn &apos;t mention it .
that &apos;s terrific !
we &apos;re both very happy .
jesus , will you hear me out at least ?
we buy here . livingston , north caldwell maybe .
right near tony . - oh .
better schools , new friends .
we got the money , baby . $ 2 million .
it &apos;s not the same , gene .
it could be better .
the summers down there-- we were ignoring the negatives .
it &apos;s fucking brutal with the bugs .
tony and silvio , all they understand is appearances .
we &apos;ll buy a new car . it &apos;ll raise my profile .
you watch , i &apos;ll make captain .
i found this
under our son &apos;s bed .
florida &apos;s any better ? it &apos;s the drug capital of the world .
look , for tony to--
tony , tony ! why don &apos;t you kill him ?
put a bullet in his fucking head .
i can &apos;t do that .
what , you think i don &apos;t know that you &apos;ve done it before ?
he &apos;s the boss , deanne .
the boss of what ? he &apos;s a piece of shit !
ls our life that bad ?
it &apos;s your money . your aunt &apos;s money .
it has nothing to do with him .
there &apos;s this wonderful jersey contemporary i want you to see with me .
it &apos;s cathedral ceilings .
you &apos;ll fall in love .
there &apos;s nothing i can say .
colonel dax ,
you &apos;re a disappointment to me .
you have spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality .
you really did want to save those men
and you were not angling for mireau &apos;s command .
you &apos;re an idealist and i pity you as i would the village idiot .
we &apos;re fighting a war , dax , a war that we &apos;ve got to win .
those men didn &apos;t fight , so they were shot .
hello .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s me .
what are you doing ?
i lost my uppers .
probably upstairs .
god fuck it all !
relax , will ya ? we &apos;ll find them .
the phone keeps ringing , and then they hang up .
it &apos;s probably salespeople .
i know who it is !
pussy malanga , i know .
we &apos;ll get j. edgar hoover right on it .
i &apos;ll tell you what , you go upstairs , you look for your teeth .
i &apos;m gonna fix you something to eat , okay ?
i had a banana in there .
all right , we &apos;ll find that too .
i got it . we buy a vacation place in florida , a condo . it &apos;s not the same .
i make another run at tony
six months , a year from now .
a year ?
you can go ahead even .
what ? and let me tell you , a year ,
two years from now
everything could be different . tony could be gone .
i , uh ... - go ahead .
his master &apos;s voice .
yeah ? now ? !
gene , this is agent sanseverino .
hello .
where &apos;ve you been , buddy ? haven &apos;t heard from you lately .
busy , you know . my kid has some problems .
that &apos;s rough .
the thing is , geno , you gotta keep in touch with me .
you have a chance to help in more important ways .
what do you mean ? - we lost a major asset this month .
the point is--
was ray curto a cooperator ?
the way things are shaping up , you &apos;re a designated hitter .
look , ron ,
we &apos;ve talked about florida , okay ?
gene , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
here among your friends is where you &apos;re useful .
i told you , you tell your bosses , i &apos;d come back for any trial .
florida &apos;s just one of those things you gotta let go .
okay . so , the feast of st. joe &apos;s , tony gave some rulings on the unions .

i thought about a boxster , but i don &apos;t know .
