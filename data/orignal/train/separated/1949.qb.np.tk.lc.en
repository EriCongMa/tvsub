each of you comes here today hopeful ...
i have five rules . memorize them .
can anybody name ...
so , you might be thinking ...
rule number five -- when i move , you move .
... i &apos;ve been here before .
trauma protocol ...
this is familiar . this is old hat .
maybe you &apos;re wondering why are we here ?
but i promise
you &apos;re about to find out that everything has changed .
what the hell are you doing ? !
you want to swing ? it feels good .
no , no , no , no .
we talked about this .
we mused about it . and then we went to bed .
i think it &apos;s a great idea . let &apos;s open up the space .
get a little light in here .
or bad -- it &apos;s a bad idea .
who wants open or sun ? bad sun . i hate sun .
i &apos;m used to living with someone who knows me ,
who knows not to change the channel during the commercials ,
someone who knows not to punch a hole in my living @-@ room wall .
you know , it &apos;s not that big of a hole .
we can probably just patch it right up .
i bet she tries to patch it up , instead of
trying to just imagine the possibility .
but , i mean , it is meredith &apos;s house .
i mean , it &apos;s my house . and i let her live there .
i should know better . why don &apos;t i learn ?
i take in strays because they &apos;re sad .
they &apos;re lonely and homeless .
the truth is strays
are flea @-@ ridden creatures who pee on your stuff .
am i a stray ?
i mean , she acts like i &apos;m some kind of animal ,
when who does the dishes ? me .
yep .
who makes sure the piles and piles of dirty laundry
are fluffed and folded ? me .
when she puts my clothes away ,
i can &apos;t find my own clothes in my own house .
i mean , they &apos;re probably just in your drawers .
it &apos;s a problem .
what &apos;s her problem ?
it &apos;s just ... she &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s just impossible .
just impossible .
you excited ?
about ... ?
april . she &apos;s coming in tonight , right ?
yeah .
i still think you should bow out
of this anatomy class you signed up to teach .
i mean , pawn it off on grey or someone else .
you &apos;re not gonna have time to teach a class
once you &apos;ve been appointed chief .
haven &apos;t been appointed yet .
um , do you know her ?
that &apos;s dr. tracy mcconnell .
chief cardio at hopkins , yale grad , yale meds .
sages award recipient .
she &apos;s catherine &apos;s candidate for chief .
dr. webber .
it is such an honor .
i have been wanting to meet you for years .
your work with islet cells , it &apos;s just absolutely inspiring .
well ... thank you . thank you .
oh , uh , all right , i &apos;m sorry . uh , this is dr. miran--
dr. -- yeah , miranda bailey , of course .
hello .
oh ! d--
uh , i &apos;m a @-@ afraid you may have gotten your times
a little wrong , dr. mcconnell .
our presentations to the board aren &apos;t until 4 : 00 p.m. today .
actually , i asked dr. webber if he wouldn &apos;t mind taking
some time this morning to show me around .
you know , give me a little tour .
yeah . i wasn &apos;t invited on any tour .
um , you know where everything is .
uh , don &apos;t you have some surgeries , doctor ?
nothing that can &apos;t be pushed .
great .
sounds fun .
that &apos;s one word for it .
so , what time &apos;s the thing tonight ?
what thing ?
for april . she comes back tonight , right ?
isn &apos;t -- aren &apos;t we doing a thing ?
big night , avery . when &apos;s kepner getting in ?
no idea .
then what time &apos;s the thing ?
there is no thing .
should we clear trauma one
to remove the giant bug from avery &apos;s ass ?
sheesh .
hey . i need advice .
okay .
i got tickets for this concert thing ,
and i &apos;m thinking about asking amelia ,
but she and i -- we don &apos;t really go to things together .
not that we couldn &apos;t ,
but should i , you know , ask her out ?
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re over @-@ thinking .
you &apos;re late .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i got stuck behind a train that just stopped forever .
i mean ...
i &apos;m sorry . you s-- you said a crash ?
... i finally turned around , but they shouldn &apos;t be allowed
to do that , right , just stop on the tracks ?
i really don &apos;t care , okay ? you missed rounds .
a pedestrian ?
it &apos;s irresponsible
t @-@ two pedestrians ?
is what it is , of the train .
two pedestrians were hit by a train ?
what ?
oh , my god .
and they &apos;re alive ?
yeah , uh ...
oh , my god . two girls were hit by a train on their way to school .
kids .
they &apos;re just kids .
jessica tanner , 15 years old .
moving train swiped her , then tossed her down the embankment .
gcs is 15 . pressure &apos;s 100 palp .
right side took all the brunt . one big bruise .
there &apos;s a shortcut to -- to school .
i @-@ i take it every day over ... the tracks .
she &apos;s tachy at 120 .
all right , i &apos;m gonna need a doppler
to check these extremities for pulses .
i @-@ i @-@ i tripped .
you know , my foot -- it got stuck in between the tracks .
try to stay calm , jess .
have you seen the other girl ? she ...
she just showed up out of nowhere .
she -- she tried to push me out of the way .
uh , uh , uh , somebody ? ! i &apos;m not sure what to do here !
help get the other patient inside .
go . torres .
take a look at this .
hey . it &apos;s gonna be all right , jess .
we &apos;re gonna take care of you -- both of you . okay ?
let &apos;s go . go .
hang two units of &quot; o &quot; neg , check the pelvic binder ,
and prep her for a rapid @-@ sequence intubation .
any word on her name ? her parents ?
uh , i don &apos;t think she had any i.d.
did you look ? did you check her bag ?
okay , where do you need me ?
she needs an ex lap .
one of her legs was ripped completely away from the other .
she has a wishbone injury .
the force of the train broke her pelvis
and split her insides apart .
i &apos;m gonna need to stabilize her pelvis and extremities ,
but not before you guys address her internal injuries .
pupillary reflexes are sluggish .
she &apos;s gonna need a head c.t.
to rule out a traumatic brain injury .
all right , you got a name for me yet ?
uh , no , but i found some textbooks .
sophomore , junior , maybe .
i &apos;m guessing she &apos;s about 16 years old .
okay , hang on , hang on . shh , quiet .
mom .
i want my mom .
grey , we &apos;re gonna need to intubate .
okay .
we don &apos;t have much time .
go ahead .
good . you &apos;re here .
she &apos;s got multiple complex injuries .
she needs to go to the o.r. for a washout .
hemothorax on her right side that needs to be drained .
jess .
have you seen her -- the other girl ?
i @-@ is she still alive ?
jess , can you tell me her name ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know her . so ...
you have the same hearts drawn on your arms .
i think you do know each other .
her name &apos;s aliyah .
and you two were out there together ?
yes .
your foot didn &apos;t get caught on the tracks , did it ?
honey , tell me what happened out there .
we just wanted to be together .
dead or alive .
and this is one of our
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art radiology suites .
we have just installed
new data @-@ processing systems with simultaneous --
simultaneous multi @-@ slice holographic imaging .
yeah .
i mean , that kind of imaging &apos;s the wave of the future .
wave of the future . i couldn &apos;t agree more .
do you mind if i take a look around ?
be my guest .
thank you .
is this the new s.e. 700 ?
yes , we just had it upgraded .
admit it . you like her .
mm , she &apos;s a solid candidate ,
certainly .
but so is bailey .
bailey knows you too well .
you all have been together too long .
she doesn &apos;t push you , richard .
but in a chief ,
you need a chief who knows how to push back .
are you implying she &apos;s soft ?
because miranda bailey is anything but soft .
i &apos;m saying that she &apos;s too comfortable here .
we need someone who will make us uncomfortable ,
someone that &apos;ll walk in here and push us to be the best .
we need someone who will surprise us .
and you know it .
instant access to case imaging
would really assist with patient care .
you &apos;re only 15 . you want to die ?
it &apos;s more complicated than that .
you were standing in front of a train .
we weren &apos;t suicidal . we just --
okay , jess , i &apos;m gonna tell you
something personal about myself , okay ?
okay .
i like men ... romantically , sometimes .
and i like women , too .
it &apos;s a big , big part of my life .
can i ask you something personal about yourself ?
do you like ... girls ?
do you ...
do you like aliyah ?
i love her .
what were you two doing out there ?
it &apos;s not that we wanted to die .
this was just ...
the only way that we could stay together ...
... you know , forever .
no . no , jess . there are so many other ways .
i ... killing yourself solves nothing .
it -- - my parents ...
they &apos;re sending me away ...
to a camp .
they come and get you in the middle of the night ,
and they take you to this place .
they change you .
they &apos;re gonna make me change my mind about aliyah .
no , they won &apos;t . there &apos;s no way .
those places don &apos;t work . they never work .
your parents are doing this ?
please . please , you can &apos;t call them .
please don &apos;t tell them that i ...
they &apos;re the whole reason why i &apos;m even here .
please . you can &apos;t call them .
aliyah &apos;s a good girl . she wouldn &apos;t miss school .
why would she be out on the train tracks ?
this doesn &apos;t make sense .
she suffered extensive injuries .
she needs surgery . i just need your consent .
well , she &apos;s o-- she &apos;s okay ? she &apos;s awake ? she can talk ?
no , she &apos;s unconscious .
she did ask for her mother .
her mother &apos;s dead .
if i could just have your consent for surgery ...
yes .
excuse me . excuse me . we &apos;re looking for our daughter .
jessica tanner . can you find us a doctor ?
i &apos;m a doctor .
i &apos;m one of your daughter &apos;s doctors , actually .
well , where is she ?
we want to see her immediately , please .
they said she was hit ... by a train ?
yes .
a train ?
i think our daughters might have
been out on the tracks together .
jess was with your daughter ?
yeah .
what &apos;s her name ?
aliyah . i &apos;m dakhir hamed .
you keep your damn daughter away from our little girl .
no one &apos;s taken a tab .
why hasn &apos;t anyone taken a tab ?
i don &apos;t know .
uh , what i do know is the labs came back on the wilbanks baby .
everything looks good there .
my flier &apos;s perfectly placed .
it &apos;s clear , aesthetically pleasing .
i mean , people have taken tabs from other fliers .
i &apos;m sorry . why do you need a roommate ? you have a house .
had a house . callie and i sold it .
now it turns out i need a little help in the rent department .
you &apos;d be surprised how many patients can &apos;t afford my fees .
i mean , what am i gonna do ?
gonna look parents in the eye and tell them
i can &apos;t treat their teeny , tiny , little sickly babies ?
do you need a place to live ?
me live with you ? god , no .
i @-@ i just -- uh , um , i already have a place .
take a tab anyway .
i mean , someone has to take a tab .
it &apos;ll make other people take tabs .
it &apos;s like putting money in your tip jar .
it just encourages tipping .
i just -- i &apos;m gonna go ...
check on things ... away from here .
clamp .
3 @-@ 0 prolene .
i could use a little breathing room here .
a little more .
i can &apos;t move any more ,
or i won &apos;t be able to zero the neuro monitor .
everything okay ?
she &apos;s just mad about the wall .
what wall ?
just stand and suction .
not talking to you .
we did talk about taking it down .
you talked about it .
i was drinking tequila .
okay , you said it was a good idea .
i should remember . i was the sober one .
well , i said i would think about it .
but the words that you said were ,
&quot; let &apos;s take the bitch down . &quot;
that was the tequila talking .
so , when you said this was my home , too ,
that i should think of it that way ,
that was the tequila talking , too ?
yeah , that sounds like something tequila would say .
can you suction over here , please ?
hey , is it a load @-@ bearing wall ?
&apos;cause if it is , it can actually bring the whole house down .
yeah , aliyah and i , we like to pass notes at school --
the kind that you fold a million different ways .
and i kept them -- every single one in a box under my bed
you know , so i could re @-@ read them when i had bad days .
bad days ?
sometimes kids at school ...
people suck , you know ,
like to tease us , throw things .
and the other day , i came home , and my mom was in my room .
she had found my box of notes .
and she burned them in the fireplace .
uh , jess &apos; parents want to see her
and speak to her surgical team .
they &apos;re here ?
tell them she &apos;s in pre @-@ op .
they will have to wait to see jess until after surgery .
you &apos;re making aliyah out to be some kind of terrible influence .
because she is . she took advantage of our daughter .
jess didn &apos;t know any better .
what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t know ?
they think they are in love , with each other .
they want to grow up and get married .
what ?
honey , the doctors .
uh , jess has sustained multiple fractures ,
including two in her left leg that need surgical intervention
immediately or she could lose use of her leg .
unfortunately , she also needs her belly explored
to evaluate the source of her internal bleeding .
there &apos;s also blood in her lungs , which required a chest tube .
luckily , it seems to be stable at the moment .
we &apos;re taking her up now .
we &apos;ll update you after the surgery .
bethany . please , let him --
shut up , steven ! shut your stupid mouth !
if you had kept your mouth shut ,
jess would be safe at camp right now .
but you had to give her the heads @-@ up , didn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s okay .
you had to tell her all about it .
torres , don &apos;t .
what are you doing , torres ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not sure you understand
what those places are like .
i know that you &apos;re trying to help your daughter ,
but that kind of camp is horrible .
it will not give her the kind of support that she needs .
i realize that you care about jess , but th--
care about her ? we love her .
she &apos;s our child . our child .
please , this doesn &apos;t concern you .
jess &apos; fear of that place
is why she stepped in front of a train to begin with .
no , we are not doing this .
she doesn &apos;t feel safe .
we are not doing this now !
you want to give parenting advice ?
talk to clueless over there .
you have no right to talk to me
about anything other than my child &apos;s medical care .
she &apos;s right to feel afraid . those places are harmful .
they will damage her mentally , emotionally .
they are tantamount to child abuse .
torres .
you are out of line .
you are here for one thing
and one thing only , and that is to attend
to my child &apos;s injuries , to help my daughter .
that &apos;s it .
so you can either shut up
and do the job that you are here to do , or i will get rid of you .
sweetie , please .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
like you said , to help your daughter .
that woman was bullying her own child .
and , you know , don &apos;t even get me started on the husband .
he is useless . useless .
poor kid &apos;s got no one in her corner .
what would make someone do that ?
i mean , why do people act like that ?
karev ?
why are you asking me ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re a bully .
his scar looks pretty nice .
i &apos;m just gonna apply a little more collagenase lotion here .
so , um ... what is your plan with april tonight ?
so , she &apos;s gonna come home from across the world
to what , a locked house ?
why do you think it is that everybody thinks
they have a right to a front @-@ row seat to my marriage ?
the show &apos;s closed . i &apos;m not selling tickets .
dr. avery ?
what ?
your gastro flap harvest is ready when you are .
that &apos;s great !
um , can you come dress this ?
you know if kepner wants a roommate ?
not if it &apos;s you .
okay , what aren &apos;t you telling me ? you know something .
why don &apos;t people want to live with me ?
i &apos;m being paged .
no , you &apos;re not . nobody &apos;s paging you .
what , are you telling me i &apos;m wrong ?
i watched you push people around for years .
you bullied interns . you bullied nurses .
hell , you bullied george .
don &apos;t go projecting all your stuff on me
just &apos; cause you got picked on as a kid .
oh , no . nobody picked on callie torres .
really ?
yeah , i wasn &apos;t an easy target .
i didn &apos;t look like the other girls . i didn &apos;t act like them .
i had to learn how to stand up to people like karev .
so i learned to fight . titanium screw , please ?
ah , tell you what , though , once you punch your first bully ,
the rest start to fall in line pretty quickly .
so you were both bullies ?
what ? no . mine was self @-@ defense .
people like you two used to call me &quot; li &apos;l maggot . &quot;
&apos;cause i was always younger than you and smaller ...
and smarter .
and my lisp ...
you guys had a field day with my lisp .
so i was &quot; li &apos;l maggot pierth . &quot;
that &apos;s kind of cute .
no , it wasn &apos;t cute .
not when i was begging not to be pantsed
in the middle of the quad .
i mean , really think about that .
my pants were literally pulled off of me
in front of other people .
or when i was screaming for help
after being locked in the janitor &apos;s closet
and left there until the cops found me the next morning .
you want to know why bullies bully --
it &apos;s &apos; cause they can .
maybe you got it worse at home ,
or maybe you &apos;re just bullying
to keep from getting bullied , but really ,
it &apos;s because people like me ,
like this girl on our table , are alone .
and ... small and vulnerable .
and pushing us around makes you feel better
about your sad , pathetic , little lives .
um , but not you guys , though .
you &apos;re cool ... now .
so , after we helped rebuild the hospital in haiti ,
i took a team down to houston
to help the relief shelters after the flooding .
outstanding .
um , so , why are you interested in moving to seattle ?
i @-@ i mean , it sounds like your hospital &apos;s doing great work .
oh , that wasn &apos;t through the hospital .
i fund most of those trips through my nonprofit .
oh . it &apos;s a bit of a passion project of mine .
oh , your nonprofit . well , now .
um , i started the hospital &apos;s free clinic .
um , we &apos;re open wednesdays and fridays .
she won &apos;t stop bleeding . damn it !
she &apos;s maxed out on pressors .
i &apos;m clamping the hilum .
it &apos;s not working .
debakey .
sorry , do you mind if i ... ?
come on , guys , she &apos;s crashing .
you don &apos;t think i know that ? somebody page cardio .
you &apos;re gonna want to open her up with a sternotomy .
i &apos;m sorry . who in the hell &apos;s that ?
right , sorry . hi . dr. tracy mcconnell .
chief of cardio at hopkins .
i &apos;m on a tour . now , about that sternotomy .
patient &apos;s chest is already open .
i don &apos;t want to make another major incision just a few inches away .
where is cardio ?
they &apos;re saying wexler and hall are out .
pierce is in surgery .
find out how long .
okay , i want to try twisting the hilum . towels .
you need to get control from a higher angle .
her pulmonary artery is lacerated ,
which means you have about 90 seconds
before she bleeds to death on that table .
i know that it seems redundant to make another large incision
in an already @-@ open chest ,
but if you do , in under a minute ,
you can have her sternum open and get a clear view
of the field from an entirely different angle .
if the choice is between giving her two chest scars
or letting her bleed to death ,
i bet she would choose the two scars .
grey ?
you &apos;re down to 60 seconds .
okay , i need a saw and a sternal retractor .
on it . prep her for a sternotomy .
right away .
got it . here &apos;s the bleeder .
okay , i &apos;ll need 4 @-@ 0 prolene and a pericardial patch , please .
got it .
that was a hell of a save , mcconnell .
it &apos;s not my save , sir . they did the hard work .
i just helped change their perspective a little .
well , i should probably get go ...
why don &apos;t people want to live with me ?
is it &apos; cause i have a kid or is it &apos; cause i &apos;m a boss ?
like people don &apos;t want to live with their boss ?
hey , did you hear , uh , dr. torres stabbed
a white supremacist in the face ?
or a @-@ a patient beat karev
and lost his finger or his eye or some--
shut up and speak ! what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
okay , have you ever been assigned
back @-@ to @-@ back overnight nicu shifts , edwards ?
and i &apos;m not talking for , like , a weekend .
i &apos;m talking for months of long , terrible , quiet nights
all alone in the nicu watching over 27 incubators
full of fragile , dying , little lives .
you know how hard that is ? do you have any idea ?
you are kind of a legend with the interns and residents .
go on .
you &apos;re one of the seattle grace five .
i survived a plane crash . uh , big deal .
and a car crash . and a shooting .
you might be immortal .
you mastered one of the most exclusive specialties
basically overnight , and then you took herman &apos;s job
and her eyesight .
okay , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s just --
you have screwed dozens of interns ,
and you got them all fired .
you speak really fast , like superhuman fast .
you have a weird name .
you know , that &apos;s not true . that &apos;s not true .
i only slept with one intern ,
and i have an awesome name .
i mean , what , man ? like , what ? what else ?
i mean , what -- do people have a problem
with the fact that i have one leg ?
i mean , do people actually go there and --
and talk crap about a one @-@ legged person ?
because that &apos;s just discrimination against amputees .
they say you have two legs ,
and you are only pretending that one is amputated .
for the parking space .
i ...
we good ?
hey . tell us something good .
mer says aliyah &apos;s hanging in there .
well , that &apos;s something .
also , jess might not be going to that camp .
i , uh ... i may have made some calls .
which one of you did it ?
you called child protective services on me ?
is this a joke ? is this some game to you people ?
if i want to send my child to a beautiful camp
run by a lovely pastor ...
... then i have every legal right to do so ,
and it is none of your business .
do you understand ? stay away from my little girl .
and stop filling her head
with your faithless , inappropriate nonsense .
you repulse me . you &apos;re disgusting !
oh , crap .
my heart was pounding , and there was a noise in my head
and then her face was just coming at me
and i was just like , &quot; aah ! &quot;
and then -- ouch ! ow ! ow !
my fist had a mind of its own .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t even know i was gonna punch her
until she was punched .
oh , my god ! i lost control . i am a monster .
i would have paid money . cash money . like 1,000 bucks .
worth every penny . it was beautiful .
okay , what happened ?
yeah , we want details .
and would someone page me , please ,
next time pierce hulks out ?
think it &apos;s funny ? it won &apos;t be when she loses her job .
i &apos;m gonna lose my job ?
you &apos;re not gonna lose your job . she attacked you .
kind of . right ?
okay , you weren &apos;t there . you don &apos;t know .
oh , the lady deserved it . she got bigot @-@ slapped .
you know she deserved it .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
there &apos;s a right and a wrong way for us to conduct ourselves .
mm , you know what ? grey has a point .
next time , leave the thumb outside the fist
when you clench .
that way , you avoid bone damage . see ?
okay , bitch lady &apos;s fine medically , no real injury ,
but she is seriously pissed and after your head .
see ?
oh , god .
is it true ? callie punched a homophobe ?
pierce punched a homophobe .
ooh , unexpected . high five .
no .
yes !
i have to go apologize to that horrible woman , don &apos;t i ?
what are you doing ?
scrubbing in on an open cholecystectomy .
yes , no , i can see that , but what are you doing ?
why are you scrubbing in for a three @-@ hour procedure
when you have a presentation to the board in 45 minutes ?
the patient is in terrible pain .
i have the ability to stop that pain ,
so i &apos;m going to do that .
so , what , you &apos;re just gonna not show up for the presentation ?
it doesn &apos;t matter if i do .
look , i just spent the day with tracy mcconnell .
she &apos;s chirpy and blonde with a perky , little ponytail .
and she &apos;s ...
fantastic , smart , talented .
i tried really hard to hate her , but i couldn &apos;t .
she &apos;s perfect . and webber &apos;s ready to marry her .
hell , i might marry her , too .
no offense . she &apos;s a catch .
and we &apos;d be lucky to have her .
hey , she may be the new idris .
now , i @-@ it &apos;s fine .
okay , being chief isn &apos;t the only thing that i ...
i mean , i &apos;ve got my son that i hardly see as it is . and you .
and i got this class that i got to start teaching .
so ... you know , i @-@ it doesn &apos;t matter .
i @-@ it &apos;s fine , really .
miranda , that &apos;s -- - no !
leave it alone .
okay ? just ... leave it .
oh , hey . uh , i @-@ is the room still available ?
did your friends put you up to this ? did you lose a bet ?
or ... do you have a thing for feet ? or -- or foot ?
what ? uh , no .
well , okay , hold on .
why would you want to live with me
instead of your intern buddies ?
i don &apos;t , uh , have any intern buddies .
they think i posed as an attending on purpose
and they made up all this stuff about me and it isn &apos;t even true .
nobody wants to talk to me , let alone live with me .
it &apos;s okay . thanks .
um , well , hold on . um , just so you know ,
two months up front . yeah ? okay .
well -- well , we can maybe -- we can make this work .
scrub out . i &apos;ll finish .
you can still make your presentation .
deluca , will you escort warren out of my surgery , please ?
okay .
oh , don &apos;t even think about it . you do not know me .
miranda , you are rolling over .
you are quitting in the middle of the race ,
and that is not okay .
would you let me quit ? would you let tuck quit ?
would you ?
what did you tell tuck
when he wanted to quit the french horn ?
he was a terrible french @-@ horn player , and still ,
what did you tell him ?
&quot; you made a commitment . &quot;
&quot; you made a commitment &quot; !
and now who is first chair ?
tuck is .
tuck is !
you don &apos;t quit . you don &apos;t roll over .
you don &apos;t let anybody take your chair !
miranda bailey , what chair are you ?
first chair .
yeah , i cannot hear you . w @-@ what chair ?
first chair .
first chair ?
first chair !
that &apos;s right !
jess &apos; injuries were extensive ,
but surgery went better than expected .
oh , thank god .
uh , bethany wanted me to ask ,
do you know when jess might be discharged ?
she &apos;s , i guess , arranging for the camp
to come pick jess up from here , and --
what ? what are you saying ?
there -- there were complications
during the surgery , and aliyah lost a lot of blood ,
and her blood pressure was very low for some time .
and we just won &apos;t know
if that caused damage unless she wakes up .
so , s @-@ she might not wake up ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying ?
i &apos;m sorry , is his daughter going to die ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i can &apos;t
discuss another patients &apos; personal information .
this can &apos;t be -- t @-@ this shouldn &apos;t be happening .
we wanted to give her a future .
we came to this country when she was 8 .
two years later , my wife died .
my family , they said ,
&quot; dakhir , you have no business raising your daughter alone . &quot;
maybe they were right .
what do i know about raising a girl ,
now a teenage girl , in america ?
all i know is it &apos;s hard .
aliyah doesn &apos;t confide in me .
why would she ?
in my community , we don &apos;t talk about things like this .
aliyah &apos;s mother would have known what to say .
she always knew .
we came here to give her a future .
and now ...
do you have a picture ?
excuse me ?
of your daughter ?
here &apos;s -- here &apos;s jess .
uh , you can &apos;t tell now with the tube in her mouth ,
but she has the best smile .
this is aliyah maybe a year ago now .
i took it at school after a game .
you know , i never realized ,
but i think that &apos;s your daughter with her .
they look really happy .
i don &apos;t believe we were introduced properly before .
i &apos;m steven .
dakhir .
your patient &apos;s been out of surgery a while .
did you wait to update the family
until my patient was out of surgery , too ?
because this hospital is worth more than that .
thank you .
thank you .
bailey should be here by now .
sorry to interrupt , but dr. bailey has a request .
i &apos;m sure dr. mcconnell gave you an excellent presentation .
scissor . watch that tissue .
she would be excellent for the job .
but that &apos;s not the point .
the point is mcconnell and i offer different things .
she is new and shiny .
and she likes a good challenge .
i know . i spent the whole day with her .
she jumps into new challenges all the time .
and that &apos;s what this place is to her --
her newest challenge ...
until she finds her next one .
and her next .
but that &apos;s not me .
see , i don &apos;t care if this place is the shiniest or the fanciest
or if it &apos;s a beat @-@ up hunk of junk .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;ll always be the ship
that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs .
this is not a stepping stone for me .
i believe in this hospital and what it can do .
and i want to push this bucket of bolts
to do the most impossible things you have ever seen .
and then i &apos;ll do more because this is my challenge .
there &apos;s a bleeder on the fossa .
yeah . clamp . use the argon beam .
avoid cbd .
slowly .
let me . good .
there .
this job was made for me . staples .
this job belongs to me . suction .
i &apos;ve earned first chair .
suture .
and every single one of you already knows it .
ready to close .
well , damn it .
dr. hudson to the o.r. 3 . dr. hudson to o.r. 3 .
is jess still at her post @-@ op x @-@ rays ?
yeah , dr. torres took her a bit ago .
you have some nerve coming here .
bethany .
mrs. tanner , i would like to apologize .
i was totally out of line before .
to think i trusted you to treat my daughter .
bethany .
i am suing you and everyone else we have met
in this godforsaken hospital .
bethany , shut up !
no one is suing ! no one is pressing charges !
the person who should be apologizing is you !
we almost lost our child today !
she almost died !
we are not sending jess away !
this stops now . do you hear me ? it stops now .
steven , what are you saying ?
this stops , or i am gone .
i will leave , and i will take jess with me ,
and you will never see her again .
i don &apos;t care ... if she &apos;s gay .
i care if she &apos;s loved . i care if she &apos;s happy .
and that is what you should care about !
what is wrong with you that you don &apos;t ? !
so , we were able to stop the bleeding , and she &apos;s stable .
so i thought you &apos;d like to see her because she is awake .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m here , aliyah .
you &apos;re okay
jessica is okay , too .
shh . d @-@ don &apos;t try to talk . it &apos;s okay .
i have something for you .
jessica asked if i could read this to you if --
when you wake up .
so ...
&quot; dear my beautiful aliyah ... &quot;
well , i like her already .
oh . sorry . you know , i , uh ...
i thought ...
why aren &apos;t you at home ?
because i thought you &apos;d be at home .
right , well , i just assumed that ...
it &apos;s fine . just , um ...
go and sleep there tonight . a real bed and all .
right . real bed . yeah . thanks .
i &apos;ve been flying all day . i &apos;m exhausted . dirty .
it &apos;s okay .
but we can talk tomorrow ?
i really want us to talk , jackson .
good night .
behold .
everything the light touches is yours .
stupid .
congratulations ... chief .
this looks amazing .
this is amazing .
now , i love you love feeding me .
i can &apos;t keep eating this like this every night .
i &apos;m gonna get fat .
what &apos;s wrong with being fat ? i used to be fat .
that &apos;s funny .
no , really .
i mean , not just roly @-@ poly . i mean big .
i mean , it didn &apos;t matter much till what --
i don &apos;t know -- 5th grade , maybe ? 6th ?
and then suddenly , everybody seemed to care .
i got picked on a bunch .
i mean , stupid stuff , you know ? names , pranks .
they shoved me in a locker once , and i got stuck .
i was -- well , i was the fat kid in class
and the screw @-@ up at home .
and it sucked . i mean , it was really hell .
so the summer after 8th grade ,
when i basically spent three straight months on my bike
riding everywhere , all day , every day ,
literally riding my ass off .
school started . nobody recognized me .
i toughened up . i mean , i had to , you know ?
want more rice ?
who does that ?
who carpools to work with somebody in the morning
and then leaves without them that night ?
i can &apos;t believe she -- she just left me .
i &apos;m happy to give you a ride . actually , i did want to --
i don &apos;t even want to go in there . i may lose it .
not even kidding . i may ...
what &apos;s happening ?
you . come here .
sorry .
sit . good .
i want you to stop
and take a closer look at the body in front of you .
i live here , too , and that means i get a say .
and i say you two need to figure your crap out .
there &apos;s nothing special about it .
it &apos;s just a body .
so , why are you here ? what &apos;s so different ?
what &apos;s changed ?
sorry about the wall .
i ...
jumped the gun .
i &apos;m sorry i said you had fleas .
meredith !
what ?
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know how to talk to you .
you are a lot ... sometimes .
i don &apos;t totally like you .
wow . okay .
but i don &apos;t have to because you &apos;re family .
i love you .
my answer is ... you .
the thing that has changed is you .
i want you to throw everything you think you know
about anatomy out the window ...
... and look at this cadaver
like you &apos;ve never seen a human body before .
now pick uo your scalpels .
place them below the xiphoid process .
press firmly .
no regrets . and let &apos;s begin .
