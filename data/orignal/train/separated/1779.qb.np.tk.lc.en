猫中之王 别扭大菜
oh , here &apos;s a fun postal fact .
the inside of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction ,
so if you broke my right thumb ,
that &apos;s the pasadena city police .
but if you broke my left thumb ,
that &apos;s the fbi .
if i &apos;m going to jail ,
i &apos;m killing him , not breaking his thumb .
yeah .
i got a letter from my meemaw .
smell this .
what is that ?
uh , roses , bengay and dr. scholl &apos;s foot powder .
yep . grandma by calvin klein .
you know , the last time i got a handwritten letter
was from someone who told me i park like a blind person .
that someone has a name .
uh , thank you .
oh , meemaw got a new set of teeth .
oh , but then she found her old ones .
oh , so , now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth .
fun .
like your comic @-@ con spock ears ,
and your around @-@ the @-@ house spock ears .
i park fine .
oh , my goodness , she &apos;s coming to visit !
oh , it &apos;ll be nice to finally meet her .
oh , you are going to love her .
she is the kindest , sweetest woman you &apos;ll ever meet .
yeah , unless you &apos;re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden .
in that case , you can expect
to have your head bashed in with a shovel .
that &apos;s not her . that &apos;s not her .
that &apos;s not her . that &apos;s not her .
that &apos;s not her .
that &apos;s not her . that &apos;s not her .
that &apos;s not her .
really ?
the old asian man is not your meemaw ?
and that &apos;s not helpful .
you know , i @-@ i got her an iphone for christmas .
i &apos;ll see where she is .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
most people her age don &apos;t embrace technology .
oh , no , she doesn &apos;t even know she has it .
no , i had my sister slip it in her bag
so that i can track her like a sea turtle .
same as when we lost you at the zoo .
uh , for the hundredth time ,
i smelled kettle corn and couldn &apos;t find the cart .
still doesn &apos;t explain
how you ended up on the freeway divider .
moon pie !
meemaw !
i &apos;m so happy to see you !
i &apos;m so happy to see you , too !
you got even smaller .
i love it !
uh , meemaw , this is leonard .
leonard , this is my meemaw .
hi . so nice to finally meet you .
let me take this for you , meemaw .
thank you .
no . oh , no . now you call her &quot; constance . &quot;
i call her &quot; meemaw . &quot;
you have your own meemaw .
it &apos;s not my fault she died when you were four .
is that nice to say to your friend ?
it isn &apos;t , meemaw .
sorry , leonard .
can you please live with us forever ?
that &apos;s ridiculous ! if you had a superpower ,
and spent your whole life being told to suppress it ,
when you finally decide to embrace that power ,
why hide in isolation ? !
i &apos;m sorry ,
and how much money did
your version of frozen make ? !
i &apos;m just saying ,
instead of &quot; let it go , &quot; she should really sing ,
&quot; look at me hiding in a freezer like a dove bar . &quot;
she built an ice castle , made a snow monster
and gave herself a complete makeover in one day .
you know what i saw you do today ?
eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil
and lie about it to your wife !
sorry for eavesdropping , but did you know
they actually had the song &quot; let it go &quot; in place
before they finalized the story ?
yeah , that &apos;s true .
in fact , they liked the song so much ,
they retooled the whole script around it .
which is probably why that movie sucks .
here we are talking about frozen ,
and yet , you got burned .
miss , i &apos;m so sorry .
how can you not like that movie ?
i just think it gets more credit than it deserves .
oh , that &apos;s what i said an hour ago .
wow . you &apos;ve been talking about frozen for an hour ?
you should &apos;ve seen us after the good dinosaur .
it was a classic western set in the post @-@ jurassic period ,
and it changed my life .
are you comfortable ?
very .
it &apos;s nice to rest
after 800 flights of stairs .
you were so cute , huffin &apos; and puffin &apos; .
there &apos;s amy .
i just know you &apos;re gonna hit it off .
you both have the same fashion sense .
hello ! come in , say hi to my meemaw .
hi . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
how was your trip ?
wonderful .
and the pilot did such a good job ,
i gave him a butterscotch .
that &apos;s great .
and look at you , sitting in sheldon &apos;s spot .
you know , i don &apos;t even get to sit there .
yeah .
and you never will .
ooh , hey , oh , ask her to do the tissue thing .
do it , ask her .
can i have a tissue ?
of course .
isn &apos;t that the best ? !
she &apos;s like grandma spider @-@ man .
he &apos;s been saying that since he was little .
i still don &apos;t know what it means .
oh , well , you two sit down and get to know each other .
i &apos;ll get your room ready .
oh , now don &apos;t you go looking through my suitcase for presents .
if i did , would i find any ?
maybe .
but you also might find my brassieres and bloomers .
that &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take !
well , this is so nice .
he &apos;s so excited to have you here and ...
okay , now let &apos;s you and me get something straight .
he may think that i came to bake him cookies ,
but the real reason is to size you up .
si @-@ size me up ?
sheldon &apos;s mother may be okay with you ,
but i &apos;m not so easy .
well , i @-@ i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like me once you get to know me .
oh , you better hope so .
a texas special cattle and calf car train set
with authentic horn and bell !
thank you , meemaw !
oh , you &apos;re welcome , moon pie .
amy , why don &apos;t you look excited ?
well , you get to watch me play with this !
oh , i see you &apos;re reading saga .
yeah , i hear it &apos;s pretty good .
it is , and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings
breastfeeding a baby right on the cover .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
you should .
he &apos;s really looked .
i &apos;m raj , by the way .
this is howard .
hi .
claire .
well , i &apos;ve never seen you here before , claire .
it &apos;s my first time .
i &apos;m looking for inspiration for this movie i &apos;m writing .
you &apos;re a screenwriter ?
well , screenwriter , slash bartender ,
slash , a month away from living in my car .
yeah , i get that .
i &apos;m a scientist ,
slash party planner ,
slash small @-@ dog enthusiast ,
slash ...
guy who probably should have stopped at &quot; scientist . &quot;
you &apos;re really a scientist ?
well , astrophysicist .
that &apos;s perfect .
do you think i could pick your brain for my movie some time ?
it &apos;s animated sci @-@ fi for kids .
sure . i love animated movies .
he does ,
and he has the lilo &amp; stitch collector plates to prove it .
excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life .
here &apos;s my number .
give me a call , we &apos;ll get together .
yeah , great .
see ya .
yeah , bye .
what are you doing ?
you have a girlfriend .
so ?
so ,
how do you think she &apos;d feel about you
helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay ?
i wouldn &apos;t say she &apos;s beautiful .
really ? you don &apos;t think she &apos;s attractive ?
i do . i just wouldn &apos;t tell my girlfriend .
constance , are you sure i can &apos;t pour you some wine ?
oh , no wine for me .
sheldon &apos;s bringing me my whiskey .
here you go , meemaw .
i made it just how you like--
a lot in a glass .
thank you , moon pie .
um , curious .
why do you call sheldon &quot; moon pie ? &quot;
&apos;cause he &apos;s so nummy @-@ nummy .
she could just eat him up .
and i call her &quot; meemaw , &quot;
because , well , just , well , look at her .
it &apos;s interesting that
leonard and penny know about his nickname
and you don &apos;t .
oh , well , you know ,
now @-@ now that i &apos;m hearing it , it does sound familiar .
how could it ?
i never told you , and you never bothered to ask .
well , now i know .
so , penny , i understand you have a new job .
yes .
i &apos;m a pharmaceutical sales rep .
it &apos;s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all .
a husband and a full @-@ time career .
i have a relationship and a full @-@ time career , too .
that doesn &apos;t bode well .
why not ? you @-@ you just said it &apos;s okay for her to work .
well , leonard doesn &apos;t need as much tending to as sheldon does .
and as moon pie explained ,
leonard &apos;s work is more of a hobby .
that &apos;s my best friend .
yeah .
look , i @-@ i get that you &apos;re protective of your grandson ,
but he &apos;s an adult now .
maybe i understand what he needs better than you do .
i appreciate your honesty , dear .
thank you .
and here &apos;s some more honesty :
i don &apos;t like you very much .
well , maybe i don &apos;t like you either .
no , no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no . y @-@ you have to like each other .
well , we have a 4 : 30 reservation at applebee &apos;s .
i think i should leave .
but why ?
other than you two fighting ,
we &apos;re having such a good time .
the minute you left the room , your precious meemaw
started giving me a really hard time .
i don &apos;t need this .
let her go .
and under no circumstance
will you give her that engagement ring .
what ring ?
maybe we should give them some privacy .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
you go ahead . i &apos;ll catch up with you .
you have an engagement ring ?
yes .
penny , did you know about this ?
all right , let &apos;s go .
when did you get an engagement ring ?
my mother gave it to me ,
and i had been thinking about giving it to you ,
but then we broke up .
well , thank goodness for that .
sheldon , will you please tell your grandmother
to stay out of this ?
oh , i don &apos;t think i could do that .
sheldon , tell this girl
that my ring will never be on her finger .
y ... i &apos;m gonna opt out of that one , too .
who said i even want to be engaged to him ?
and if i do , i @-@ i don &apos;t need your hand @-@ me @-@ downs !
all right , all right !
look , l @-@ let &apos;s all ...
let &apos;s remain calm
and analyze this situation .
now , i realize that you &apos;ve only known each other
for less than a day ,
but is it possible this crankiness is because
your cycles have synced ?
you leave the room
and let the grown @-@ ups talk .
now .
don &apos;t speak to him like he &apos;s a child .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna go next door and play with leonard .
okay , so you met this girl , you exchanged numbers ,
and you &apos;re gonna meet up with her .
just to help her with her screenplay .
oh . well , i guess that &apos;s not so bad .
you weren &apos;t there .
he was really flirting .
hey , it &apos;s not my fault if american women project
their fantasies on foreigners
with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes .
i &apos;m sure it was harmless .
people flirt . no big deal .
really ? so it &apos;s okay if i fl ...
not you . i own your ass .
the real question is , where are you with emily ?
uh , it &apos;s hard to say .
i think we &apos;re good , but things like this
make me wonder if emily &apos;s really the right person for me .
i mean , did you guys ever have doubts about each other ?
no . never .
absolutely .
what ?
howie , you forget how much of our early dates
involved you doing magic and me doing this .
fine .
i had reservations about you , too .
no , you didn &apos;t .
no , i didn &apos;t .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter now ,
&apos;cause i love how things worked out .
me , too .
and i think you &apos;re even more beautiful than this rose .
the last time i saw my grandma ,
the most exciting thing was watching
the ash of her cigarette get longer
and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding .
did it ?
yeah , right in there . she ate it and everything .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny . leonard and penny .
come in !
what happened ?
is amy gone ?
no . they asked me to leave
so they could speak privately .
yeah , i know . it was quite tense .
so here &apos;s the million dollar question :
uh , who wants to pop over there and get my trains ?
all right . i &apos;ve made up my mind .
i &apos;m gonna do the right thing , call this girl ,
and let her know that i &apos;m in a relationship .
okay , so far we &apos;ve heard ,
&quot; made up my mind , i &apos;m dumping emily . &quot;
&quot; made up my mind to date both of them
by pretending to be twin brothers . &quot;
and &quot; made up my mind ,
i &apos;ll ask for a threesome
and if they say no , play it off as a joke . &quot;
i &apos;m calling her .
and the threesome didn &apos;t deserve the belly laugh it got .
you &apos;re right .
it could totally happen .
hello ?
hi . hi . yeah , it &apos;s raj .
rajesh . we met at the comic book store .
hey , what &apos;s up ? figure out what time you &apos;re free ?
actually , that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling .
i , um ... i just ...
i need to let you know that i have a girlfriend .
okay . good for you .
well , no , no .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to mislead you
after you asked me out .
i didn &apos;t ask you out .
i just need help with my screenplay .
wait , are you saying that we didn &apos;t have a vibe ?
why do you care if we have a vibe ?
you have a girlfriend .
come on ! i just told you i had a girlfriend .
the least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe .
sure , we had a vibe .
i knew it . okay , we did have a vibe .
this is exciting .
what &apos;s my next move ?
you still have a girlfriend .
right . good catch .
anyway , so i &apos;m sorry to waste your time .
and , uh ... and good luck with your screenplay .
hang on .
we &apos;re both adults .
we can still get together without it meaning anything .
not me . ever since you admitted we had a vibe ,
i &apos;ve been planning our wedding .
look , it &apos;s just coffee .
i &apos;ll ask you some questions about science ,
and if you propose , i promise to say no .
okay . that hurts a little , but okay .
great . i &apos;ll text you .
bye .
all right .
so , uh , we &apos;re meeting for coffee like two adults .
everybody &apos;s happy . easy peasy .
are you gonna tell emily ?
yeah , of course .
we have no secrets .
when are you gonna tell emily ?
he lied about the cream cheese !
he ate the whole thing ! i saw him !
look , i know you think i &apos;m not right for sheldon ,
but trust me , i &apos;m his best shot .
you have no idea how much i put up with !
i know more than you think i do .
really ? you know what it &apos;s like to have date night ruined
because google changed their font ?
young lady ,
if you think i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like
to live with a stubborn , egotistical man ,
then you &apos;re wrong .
&apos;cause that was my husband .
really ?
there were days i wanted to fill his pockets with corn
and toss him in the pigpen .
well , if you understand ,
then why are you giving me such a hard time ?
because when you broke up with sheldon ,
it hurt him deeply ,
and i don &apos;t want to see that happen again .
hi . sorry .
sheldon would like to say something to you .
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
just get in here .
hello .
go ahead .
meemaw , look ,
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
i have to defend my girlfriend to you .
oh , sheldon , thank you .
oh , great , now you &apos;re gonna get emotional .
i always looked up to you and pop @-@ pop .
i @-@ i know what a challenging man he could be ,
but i saw you stand by him
and @-@ and make him into a better person .
i did .
yeah , well , that is exactly
what i &apos;ve been doing the last five years
with this little work in progress .
he never disappoints , does he ?
i think what sheldon means to say is
we &apos;ve both grown together .
isn &apos;t that right ?
say yes .
yes .
fine .
if you feel so strongly , i won &apos;t stand in your way .
thank you .
so if he wanted to give me that engagement ring ,
we would have your blessing ?
i suppose .
i just gave you my virginity , woman .
cool your jets .
yeah , see , if you just change the story
to the destruction of our galaxy ,
then a super massive black hole could work .
this is great .
thank you so much .
i just got to figure out a way for everyone
to die that isn &apos;t too scary for children .
and that &apos;s how mommy and daddy met .
hey , did you ever tell emily about us ?
i will !
