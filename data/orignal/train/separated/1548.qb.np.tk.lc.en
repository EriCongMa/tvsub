claire . there &apos;s a girl in luke &apos;s bed .
where &apos;s luke ?
with the girl !
should we just make a noise and scare her off ?
is it a girl or a possum ?
honey , there &apos;s no one there .
there was . i saw girl bumps and hair .
it was probably just his chewbacca doll .
it &apos;s not a doll . it &apos;s a plush action figure .
well , as long as he &apos;s sleeping with that thing ,
it &apos;s the only action he &apos;s gettin &apos; .
i &apos;m so relieved . i wasn &apos;t ready for that .
you thought you saw something that wasn &apos;t there .
it &apos;s dark , and we shared an entire bottle of wine .
it is dark .
i didn &apos;t see you do air quotes around &quot; shared . &quot;
all right . these contracts are good to go .
all that &apos;s left is the inspection .
already scheduled it .
andy , if i could bottle you up
and put you into a cologne , you know what i &apos;d call it ?
&quot; initiative . &quot;
the black @-@ and @-@ white commercial
would have models turning into panthers .
&quot; initiative -- a unisex fragrance from california . &quot;
i want to come back to this because it &apos;s fun ,
but i need your advice .
you remember my cousin back in utah ,
the real @-@ estate developer ?
yeah .
well , turns out his v.p. &apos; s leaving
to start his own company ,
and my cousin needs someone , like -- like , now .
that &apos;s a big opp--
what are you doing home ?
are you serious ? school &apos;s out . i &apos;m home for the summer .
you knew this .
must have slipped my mind . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re back .
that &apos;s it ?
sanjay &apos;s parents are throwing him
a three @-@ day &quot; welcome home &quot; party .
they even made him a suit out of marigolds .
this is a nice surprise , pumpkin .
was i too subtle with the way
i put it on the calendar , or ...
someone woke up in a good mood .
and there is only one reason
a teenage boy is ever like that .
yep , because it &apos;s family camp training day !
oh , i was gonna say ,
&quot; the harlem globetrotters must be in town . &quot;
luke and i are training for the big ... famcathlon .
you &apos;re , uh , carb @-@ loading .
good idea , buddy !
hungry dude .
hungry for family camp !
don &apos;t say &quot; no &quot; right away , but picture me with these .
sweetie , you &apos;re 8 years old . give your body time to develop .
these curls ! i want a perm !
take it from someone
who had a perm at your age -- you don &apos;t .
okay , what do you think of my airplane outfit ?
when i land in missouri , i want to blend right in .
with what ? a jug band ?
i got a job this summer
as an assistant defensive coordinator
for the missouri state football team .
go , bears ! i &apos;m going home .
and i have been crazy with work , which means
lily will be going back and forth between the two of us .
it has been a little tense
putting together a time @-@ share agreement , though .
i haven &apos;t been making it tense .
you &apos;re the one who treats our daughter
like she &apos;s a vacation property in aruba .
maybe you should be promoted to very defensive coordinator .
there you go .
okay , you typed up
how we &apos;re gonna share our daughter .
what is this -- some sort of custody agreement ?
i just drafted a document
that reflects what we discussed last night .
you have a tendency to forget about things you agreed to , cam .
okay , that &apos;s a bunch of hooey .
rich ! i forgot to bring up the towels . that proves nothing .
i wouldn &apos;t bother you , but i &apos;m late for court .
it &apos;s really very straightforward .
if it rains for more than three days in missouri ,
that borrows against my time .
conversely , if lily does go to gymnastics camp ,
i get an extra week .
it &apos;s too confusing .
wait -- you &apos;re a lawyer , right ?
can i actually have you take a peek at something for me ?
w @-@ what are you doing ?
i &apos;m lawyering up .
uh , yeah .
there &apos;s a lot of ambiguous language in this contract .
i wouldn &apos;t sign it .
nobody &apos;s asking him to .
you know , i never would have agreed to give up 4th of july ,
and now i &apos;m worried
he &apos;s trying to trick me out of biscuit bonanza .
b @-@ biscuit bonanza ?
it &apos;s what it sounds like .
it &apos;s a biscuit @-@ baking competition ,
and then you see who can throw theirs the furthest .
may i present exhibit &quot; a &quot; ?
that &apos;s fine , mitchell -- i don &apos;t care about 4th of july ,
as long as i get lily for biscuit bonanza .
biscuit bonanza ? !
yeah . it &apos;s what it sounds like . it &apos;s a biscuit @-@ baking --
okay , i have never hated the sound of my own voice more .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go pick up that costume .
what costume ? oh , my god , cam .
don &apos;t forget about pepper &apos;s brunch .
okay , stop it !
isn &apos;t it your first day back working with claire ?
i got to get this e @-@ mail out first
to a store that got my order wrong .
do i look like a guy
who would wear a shirt with pineapples all over it ?
kinda .
i want to use all caps to get across how angry i am ,
but it takes forever to press &quot; shift &quot; before each letter .
why don &apos;t you just put on the caps lock ?
you can do that ?
oh , jay .
just double @-@ click here .
didn &apos;t work .
well , that &apos;s because you didn &apos;t double @-@ click .
you just clicked twice .
the hell &apos;s the difference ?
double @-@ click . see ?
that &apos;s exactly what i did .
double ... click .
no , you &apos;re still just clicking twice .
listen to me -- &quot; double @-@ click . &quot;
not &quot; double ... click . &quot;
i &apos;m not an idiot .
double @-@ click !
you can &apos;t possibly think that &apos;s the same thing !
it &apos;s the exact same thing !
double @-@ click !
double @-@ click !
oh , what the ...
it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever used the f @-@ word .
ay , what &apos;s going on here ?
even for me , it &apos;s a little screamy !
i &apos;m going to work ! wh--
why did you get him so mad ?
i need him in a good mood .
i need to ask him to go with me next week
to ju√°rez to my cousin &apos;s wedding .
is that safe ?
of course not .
the invitation says &quot; short run to the reception . &quot;
what are the odds the valet slid the seat back
because of my weirdly short arms ?
shoot . i should take this .
then i ... should take this .
evan .
look , i know why you &apos;re calling ,
and no , i haven &apos;t changed my mind .
i still don &apos;t want the job .
so , you &apos;re turning down a chance
to move home for your dream job --
an actual career -- all because of a girl ?
this haley must be something special .
hello ?
i think i lost you .
hello ? evan ?
dropped call . i &apos;ll try him back .
i knew it !
thanks .
good to have you back , jay !
good to be back , buddy .
little trick of the trade --
when you don &apos;t know somebody &apos;s name , you call &apos; em &quot; buddy . &quot;
so , the old office , huh ?
i see you got the lamp over there now .
i tried it there once .
you &apos;ll see .
your office is gonna be ready this afternoon .
do you want to go pick up your new --
so , what are we working on ? quarterly reports ?
actually , no . this is a personnel file .
i have to fire neal today .
neal ? - yeah -- neal .
works in the warehouse , loves canada , heavyset fella .
oh , you mean &quot; big buddy . &quot;
we are losing more in shipping screw @-@ ups than he makes .
it &apos;s time .
you gonna do that now ?
oh . no .
um , actually , right now , i was going to make copies
of the agenda for this afternoon &apos;s staff meeting .
let me do it . how many do you need ?
uh , 12 double @-@ sided --
dad , are you sure ?
do you even know where the copy room is ?
claire . please . i built this place .
okay .
other way .
hi , jay .
not now , buddy !
that &quot; buddy &quot; stuff may have worked for my dad ,
but i wanted a more personal touch when i took over .
i wanted this to be a fun place to work ,
so i had an arcade dance game installed in the warehouse .
i figure you give them a little sugar ,
takes the edge off when you have to fire someone like ...
what is going on ?
dude , neal is tearing it up on this dance machine .
check out his score .
he &apos;s pretty quick on that thing .
oh , don &apos;t worry , claire .
he &apos;s never gonna beat your record .
you &apos;ve had that for months . no one &apos;s even come close .
oh , i &apos;m not worried about that .
okay . god . don &apos;t be defensive .
new high score !
i did it !
new high score !
uh , s @-@ sorry , claire .
yikes . i would not want to be the guy who just beat the boss .
i actually like my job .
hey , can i get a zip ?
i &apos;m gonna take it .
pepper &apos;s parties are as fun as they are confusing .
okay , stay with me on this one .
gender blender broadway brunch .
you dress as a broadway character of the opposite sex ,
and there &apos;s no solid food .
it &apos;s a perfect party
if you &apos;re a show queen with a broken jaw .
uh , excuse me .
sorry , mr. pritchett . your card has been declined .
oh , no , that &apos;s impossible .
no , i ran it , like , three times .
i think i &apos;m supposed to cut it .
oh , no , no ! don &apos;t cut it ! i have some cash in the car .
can you just unzip me ? i think it &apos;s stuck .
oh , it is stuck . you want me to cut it ?
no , no ! don &apos;t cut it !
god . you really want to cut something .
i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , damn it !
excuse me . how much for a picture ?
oh , i &apos;m actually not --
please . our daughter loves &quot; annie . &quot;
well , uh ...
actually , i @-@ i could use , like , $ 20 .
$ 20 ? wolverine was $ 10 .
look , i don &apos;t want to fight . i just -- i just need --
hey , man . what the hell ?
no , no , no !
it &apos;s not easy to get jay to do what i want ,
so sometimes i have to use my secret weapon .
but when i &apos;m too tired for that ,
i just play one of the movies that make him cry like a baby .
is this &quot; rudy &quot; ?
oh , i love this movie .
you do ?
jay , i got us tickets to the ballet ,
but i know that you &apos;re golfing on sunday .
whatever you want .
you know , rudy was small ,
but he had a big heart .
joe , what are all these cartoons ?
now all of mommy &apos;s movies are gone !
manny did it .
what am i supposed to do when i babysit this guy ?
make conversation ?
the kid has two stories .
look . i &apos;m a tree .
that &apos;s the good one .
mom , why aren &apos;t you calling me back ?
i &apos;m at your work . i need to talk .
uh , excuse me . have you seen claire ?
someone said she was down here .
uh , nope .
i couldn &apos;t fire neal .
it would look like i was only doing it
to get back at him for beating my record .
game over !
so i had no choice -- i had to beat neal &apos;s score .
hello ?
how do you work a copy machine ?
you can &apos;t be serious .
i need to make 12 double @-@ sided copies .
it &apos;s an impossible task .
can &apos;t you just ask someone for help ?
i made a big deal out of coming back here to work .
i &apos;d like to appear useful .
wait -- on the screen , there &apos;s an exclamation mark .
is that good ?
i don &apos;t think it means it &apos;s excited about what &apos;s happening .
did you put the original in the tray ?
tray ? you mean like a serving tray ?
yes , jay . i want you to put papers in a serving tray .
how have you remained alive ?
i found it !
yeah ! yeah !
great ! it &apos;s stuck !
that &apos;s okay . whatever you do , don &apos;t pull the --
hold on . i &apos;m pulling it .
no !
yes ! new high score ! finally !
are you hungry ?
what &apos;s wrong ? is it whitney houston &apos;s birthday again ?
no , honey , i &apos;m just sad about
being away from you for so long .
we still have six hours together .
let &apos;s have a special day !
oh , that would be fun .
we could take a bike ride or have a picnic .
i was thinking something a little more permanent .
okay . prepare to receive .
and remember , it &apos;s all about the strength of the nestle .
a tiny but noticeable red mark on his neck ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
someone &apos;s been practicing his orange grip .
pick up the pace !
this is where we make up
for your mom being so bad at hula @-@ hooping .
shoot !
i randomly found this in a bush under luke &apos;s window .
alex probably asked haley to borrow them ,
haley threw the pair ,
alex caught one ,
the other one flew out the window ,
phone call came , they forgot . girls .
what are you doing home ?
being crushed over and over by family members .
got your message .
i know you probably didn &apos;t mean &quot; come over right away , &quot;
but you know how paranoidy i can be , so ...
we should talk in my room .
o ... kay .
andy . hold on a sec .
i know we didn &apos;t get to finish our talk earlier ,
because of alex &apos;s surprise pop @-@ in .
listen .
if you &apos;re not taking that job in utah because of me ,
you &apos;re making a mistake .
i love you and me together , but it would break my heart
if i was the reason
you gave up this dream career opportunity ,
because , honestly ,
i don &apos;t know how much of a future there is here .
but ...
if our bond is as strong as we think it is ...
we &apos;ll work our way back to each other .
okay .
what he said .
hey , what &apos;s all the buzz about ?
somebody finally top neal &apos;s untoppable --
what happened ?
someone unplugged the dance machine .
so my high score &apos;s gone ?
don &apos;t you mean neal &apos;s high score ?
no ! i got an 805 , like , 20 minutes ago !
oh , come on !
y @-@ you can &apos;t think that i &apos;m really so upset
that i would actually --
damn , claire .
you didn &apos;t have to go all &quot; black swan &quot; on the guy .
are we really not believing this woman ?
she &apos;s never been anything but honest with us .
when i screw up , she lets me know it ,
but in a caring way .
same with you , bernard ... tom .
marie , you know it .
it &apos;s time we started appreciating this lady .
she may have gotten an 800 on the dance game ,
but if you ask me ,
she gets a 1,000 on the boss game .
okeydoke .
did you get the costumes ?
barely . my credit card was denied ,
and someone spent all the cash we had in the car .
uh , yeah . those are probably both on me . i @-@ i apologize .
let &apos;s maybe just forgive everything i &apos;ve done today .
&quot; everything &quot; ? what does that mean ?
it means this !
ohhh , my god !
i just wanted to give her a special treat before i left .
i thought we were gonna wait until she was older .
did i have to put that in writing , too ?
can i sue him ? i want to sue him .
you both have every right to be upset with me .
and maybe a few weeks away from me will do some good .
i &apos;m just gonna get a cab to the airport .
don &apos;t be crazy . we &apos;ll drive you .
no , i don &apos;t think i can handle a public emotional goodbye !
remember her ?
damn it !
dad ?
of course i have the agendas , claire .
i was just ... trying to prove a point .
i mean , what do you need those things for , anyway ?
agendas -- they &apos;re crutches . they &apos;re for the weak .
you think the founding fathers wrote down an agenda ?
well , isn &apos;t the declaration of inde--
a leader leads , not reads .
you go into that meeting with a bunch of agendas ,
you &apos;re asking for their approval .
&quot; like me ! like me ! like me ! &quot;
i say &quot; no &quot; !
how many times have i told you --
the first rule of being a good boss is
&quot; you don &apos;t need your employees to be your friends . &quot;
you need them to respect you !
thank you .
that is ... exactly what i needed to hear .
i &apos;m just doing my job .
yeah .
just trust your gut , kid .
double @-@ click ...
on ... yourself .
what smells so good ?
i &apos;m making my favorite lasagna
for my own &quot; welcome home &quot; dinner .
can i ask you a question ?
what ?
do you think it &apos;s possible
that your brother snuck a girl in here last night ?
i wouldn &apos;t be too surprised .
so you think he &apos;s -- t @-@ that they &apos;ve been --
oh , come on , dad . don &apos;t be so naive .
we were all 17 once .
it &apos;s not like we all --
i sat there like that for 20 minutes .
and then i got some more awful news .
i just got an e @-@ mail saying family camp was canceled --
not enough sign @-@ ups .
that &apos;s it ?
you don &apos;t care at all , do you ?
you &apos;re too busy running around with that girl from last night !
yeah ! that &apos;s right ! i know everything !
how could you , luke ?
to be honest , i don &apos;t know why i was so upset .
i knew i was supposed to be mad ,
but i couldn &apos;t figure out why ,
so i just started saying a bunch of stuff .
under my roof ? !
that was weird .
in a bed that i paid for ? !
what does that have to do with anything ?
with your grandfather watching ? !
what ?
but it wasn &apos;t half as crazy as what i really wanted to yell ,
which was &quot; just stop growing up ! &quot;
look , i &apos;m not sure everything i said here makes sense ,
but ... just be careful and respectful .
and you did break a big rule ,
so no car privileges for a month .
i don &apos;t need it anyway .
i just got dumped .
we sat there like that for 20 minutes .
how was your first day at work ?
it was a little rough ,
but i kind of stumbled into something .
aren &apos;t you going to ask him , mommy ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
nothing .
i was going to ask you to go to ju√°rez with me
next week for my cousin &apos;s wedding ,
but i know that you don &apos;t want to go , so i &apos;ll go alone .
you &apos;re really not gonna go ?
well , you heard her . she &apos;s fine going alone .
if that plane leaves the ground and you &apos;re not with her ,
you &apos;ll regret it .
maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow ,
but soon , and for the rest of your life .
what did you say ? is that &quot; casablanca &quot; ?
&quot; it doesn &apos;t take much to see &quot;
&quot; the problems of three little people &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . &quot;
&quot; someday , you &apos;ll understand that . &quot;
&quot; now , now . &quot;
here &apos;s looking at you , kid .
gloria ! about that wedding --
i &apos;m already booking the ticket !
okay , it &apos;s growing !
i &apos;m on hold with the credit @-@ card company .
we should probably try and figure out dinner .
i have no idea what we even have in the --
oh , my god . lily , look .
daddy made us all this food .
&quot; heat for 20 minutes . love me for the rest of time . &quot;
&quot; the sun will come out tamales . &quot;
oh , my god .
you think he forgot about my curlers
because he was too busy cooking ?
maybe . i don &apos;t kn--
oh , yes . hello ?
oka-- okay . well , thank you .
um , daddy bought a plane ticket
to surprise us on the 4th of july .
that &apos;s why my credit card was over the limit .
now i feel bad for yelling at him .
yeah , me too .
so , this is the end of the line .
no . no ! i told you !
you &apos;re gonna come visit , i &apos;ll come there --
no . i meant security .
so ... none of that messy stuff ,
because this is not goodbye goodbye .
yeah . we &apos;ll leave the drama to those two .
&quot; promise me you won &apos;t forget me , my darling . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll love you until this pantsuit comes back in style . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t regret a single minute i &apos;ve spent with you . &quot;
&quot; i think you &apos;re the first man i &apos;ve ever loved . &quot;
not a single minute .
you really are the first .
now , i had pigs and cows when i was growing up --
cam !
oh , my gosh ! what are you guys doing here ?
we spent the whole day thinking about ourselves ,
and then realized ...
you &apos;ve spent the whole day thinking about us , too .
so i brought you something to take to missouri .
i &apos;m coming with you , daddy !
oh , my gosh ! i get to keep her for the whole summer ?
yeah !
but won &apos;t you miss her ?
no . no .
because i &apos;m coming , too !
my good-- well , what about work ?
well , i figure i could work from there ,
and , you know , fly back when i need to .
think i could use a summer of smelling fresh biscuits --
and , apparently , throwing them .
well , look who thinks he &apos;s gonna qualify his first year .
we &apos;re gonna be missourians !
sometimes , you have one of those days
where you are surrounded by people
but you still feel pretty lonely .
all you want to do is go home to the comfort of your family .
but sometimes , even your family can &apos;t give you that comfort .
because it turns out they &apos;ve all had one of those days , too .
all you can do is wait for days like that to be over ...
so you can go to bed
and hope you wake up to a better tomorrow .
phil .
phil , i think i hear something in luke &apos;s room .
again ?
what ?
we know how much you love family camp .
but it was canceled ,
and i thought you were all kind of over it .
we may be over it , but we &apos;re not over us .
what do you think about family camp 2.0 ?
yeah , phil , come on . cab &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
don &apos;t you have some packing to do ?
why are we always waiting on you ?
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m packing for ,
but i love this !
all right . how good do these look ?
that &apos;s why they call them &quot; new york &apos;s finest . &quot;
yeah , who needs a campfire
when we &apos;ve got a metal box full of gray water ?
okay , everybody , picture .
uh , ma &apos;am ? would you mind ?
get in the back . get in the back . you &apos;re tall . okay . okay .
all right . and ...
and now we &apos;re down to three phones .
hey , boss . it &apos;s dad .
i know i just started back ,
but i &apos;m taking a couple of days off , if that &apos;s okay .
and if not , too bad . i &apos;m in ju√°rez !
hey , dad . it &apos;s mitch .
uh , i &apos;m in missouri with cam .
no , it &apos;s not a hostage situation .
anyway , uh , can you swing by our place and water our plants ?
oh , and don &apos;t forget about the ficus in the bedroom .
i know how much you love to go in there .
hey ! it &apos;s your big sis , ya big sis .
so , we all flew to new york this morning .
thank god dad came back to work . he can cover for me .
anyway . listen , i think i left the back door unlocked .
can you check ?
come to new york ! the pretzels are huge !
