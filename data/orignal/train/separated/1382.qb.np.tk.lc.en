hi , mom .
hi , baby .
i brought you a whole bunch of photos .
thank you !
yeah , anything to make this place
look a little more homey .
how you doing ?
me ? i &apos;m okay .
why ?
oh , just &apos; cause , you know ,
i mean , we had that conversation about my work ,
and , you know , we never ...
you never really brought it up again , so ...
neither did you .
well , that &apos;s because you acted like everything was fine ,
and , you know , i didn &apos;t want to --
well , that &apos;s what this mother does .
she acts like everything &apos;s okay ...
even if it &apos;s not .
i know that it bothers you , mom .
look ...
i wish i didn &apos;t say all of those things
i said the other day .
i @-@ i wish i had said them differently .
but , honestly , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s complicated .
i mean , i respect what you do .
but it &apos;s hard for me sometimes .
i get that , ma .
i do .
good morning .
hi .
hi . how are you ?
i was up late last night .
wait , don &apos;t tell me .
you attended a lecture on the life @-@ span of parasites
in open wounds .
no .
no , i was volunteering at hope &apos;s clinic again ,
and i want to thank you for encouraging me .
yeah , no problem . any time .
did you get korsak &apos;s call about the shooting ?
i did , and i told him that i would wait for you , so ...
well , we &apos;re off to the park .
‭ it &apos;s nothing dangerous .
i love you .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s so satisfying to really connect with the patients
that i &apos;m helping .
you know , and hope was so lovely .
you know , sharing her passion for her work
really brought us closer together .
you know , last night , she was telling me this story about --
i got a job offer .
what kind of job offer ?
a teaching offer .
um , a -- an instructor ...
at the fbi academy in quantico .
what do you think ?
wow . i ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . what do you think ?
i mean , it &apos;s a good job .
it &apos;s ... good money , excellent benefits .
you know , but i &apos;d have to leave my family ...
bpd , boston .
i think it &apos;s extraordinary .
just , i don &apos;t know if teaching is just the thing for me .
okay , so let &apos;s do the pros and cons .
okay .
no more calls in the middle of the night .
yeah , but there &apos;s not that much excitement
in a regular 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 .
all right , but you don &apos;t have to chase vicious criminals
into dangerous situations .
okay , well , that &apos;s just good exercise .
i &apos;m sure they have a gym .
okay , how about this ?
uh , no one will be shooting at you .
and that &apos;s a good thing ?
it is for your mother .
all right , well , just keep this between us
until i figure out what i &apos;m gonna do .
of course .
thanks .
beautiful morning in the park , sergeant .
not for this guy .
jogger found him , called it in earlier .
any witnesses ?
no , it was too early . nobody around .
that is some shotgun wound .
yeah , i &apos;ve got uniforms
searching the area for a murder weapon .
nothing yet .
well @-@ dressed guy alone in the park .
maybe it was a robbery .
still had his wallet and a rolex watch .
name is michael steele , 1818 deckard .
i sent frankie to the house .
i &apos;m gonna get nina to do a full background check .
maura , what do you got ?
well , the fatal shotgun round
appears to be a double @-@ ought buckshot .
spread pattern indicates that the shots
were fired from approximately 15 to 20 feet .
looks like there might have been someone in the bushes .
branches are all broken , and the ground &apos;s matted .
you think they were lying in wait ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s not a professional hit .
a pro wouldn &apos;t use a shotgun .
it &apos;s not a robbery . nothing &apos;s taken .
could be random .
i hate random .
oh . i hope you &apos;re having better luck than i did .
the victim had a very nice apartment near fenway ,
but it was clean .
everything was in its place .
however , i did ...
find this cellphone bill , which is weird ,
because there was no phone in the apartment
or with the body at the crime scene .
can you run this through the tracking system ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
well , what did you learn about the victim ?
uh , he &apos;s a 42 @-@ year @-@ old cpa with his own small firm .
specializes in forensic accounting .
he freelances with a variety of financial companies .
nothing out of the ordinary .
no money problems , no criminal record ,
no pending litigation .
well , someone didn &apos;t like him .
okay , nina ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
did i do something or ...
no .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with you . not really .
&quot; not really &quot; means it has everything to do with me .
my mother is in town .
oh , i thought you and your mother were close .
yeah , but i don &apos;t like the way she treats my boyfriends .
okay .
it &apos;ll be fine .
you don &apos;t know how she is .
how is she ?
we got a location on the cellphone .
nina says the victim &apos;s cellphone
is pinging off the tower due east of here .
call the number .
how the hell did his phone get so far away from his body ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe the murderer took it .
killed him for his cellphone ?
what &apos;s the world coming to ?
maybe he had something on the phone that the murderer wanted .
over here ! we got another body !
hey , call an ambulance ! this one &apos;s alive !
vince korsak . we need an ambulance at the park .
yeah .
we found another guy .
i &apos;ll check on him .
no , no , no . he &apos;s -- he &apos;s still alive .
the ambulance is on its way .
he had the phone , and he had this .
婚礼教堂
edward &apos;s the other guy ?
who &apos;s edward ?
my ex @-@ husband .
what can i tell you about edward dunn ?
i could think of a few things i &apos;d like to know .
all right .
he came from a wealthy family .
his father , phillip , runs a large investment firm --
dunn global holdings .
and edward &apos;s a civic leader , a philanthropist .
how long were the two of you married ?
well , we came to our senses ,
and we had the marriage annulled the next morning .
about the time the booze wore off .
we were young and foolish , not drunk .
this is a police station .
this is not &quot; the jerry springer show . &quot;
maura &apos;s marriage has nothing to do with our investigation ,
so let &apos;s focus on the facts , shall we ?
yeah .
so , what can you tell us about edward pertaining to our case ,
and not the marriage that we know nothing about ?
well , i haven &apos;t seen him in years .
you know , i read recently in the paper
that he took over the company
because his father died of a heart attack .
but that &apos;s about it .
okay . thank you , maura .
so ...
you &apos;ll let me know if his condition improves ?
of course .
okay .
what ? i &apos;m just curious .
can you work up a background of edward dunn , please ?
yeah .
so , what do you think mr. isles
was doing in the woods with a dead man &apos;s cellphone ?
i &apos;d certainly like to ask him .
what did the hospital say ?
he &apos;s stable . still in a coma , unable to speak .
joann ?
hi . how are you ?
hi .
good .
been busy . you know -- girl scouts , little league .
how &apos;s ron ?
dad &apos;s okay .
good . i &apos;m glad to hear that .
take care .
you too .
wait . angela .
i was sorry about what happened between you and my dad .
i never meant ...
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
we do what we have to do for our children .
i just never thought that what i said would break you guys up .
well , your dad &apos;s a wonderful man
with a family that he loves ,
and i just didn &apos;t want my stuff to , uh , come between you two .
i saw a picture of your little guy on facebook --
with the legos .
yeah .
yeah , so cute .
thank you .
take care .
you too .
i take it there were no surprises
regarding cause of death .
no.he died of massive hemorrhaging from a shotgun wound .
there was no other drugs or alcohol in his system .
all of the physiology was very unremarkable
and what we &apos;d expect to find in a healthy 42 @-@ year @-@ old man .
what about the clothes for edward dunn ?
there was some blood on his jacket
that matched the victim &apos;s .
oh , and we found some gunshot residue on edward &apos;s coat .
enough to make him the shooter ?
mm , it &apos;s hard to say .
but it doesn &apos;t rule him out as a shooter ?
no , it does not .
all right , well ...
we will broaden our search for the weapon .
maybe he tossed it when he was running from the scene .
he could have .
how &apos;s she doing ?
oh . i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s been very quiet .
all right .
our victim and edward have nothing in common .
but starting about a week ago ,
there &apos;s a series of calls between them
from their business phones .
why would a big investment fund
go to a small accounting firm with one accountant ?
they might not have .
our victim , michael steele ,
was a forensic accountant -- a whistle @-@ blower .
nina uncovered a string of complaints
that he made to the sec about several investment firms .
i bet that made him popular in financial circles .
did he file a complaint against edward &apos;s firm ?
no .
maybe he was about to .
dunn took over his father &apos;s firm six months ago .
what if he &apos;s suddenly got a whistle @-@ blower
breathing down his neck about financial improprieties ?
well , if edward killed the accountant , where &apos;s the shotgun ?
maybe edward took some muscle with him to pull the trigger ,
and that person got away with the gun .
what do we know about edward &apos;s father &apos;s death six months ago ?
heart attack .
he was rushed to bayview hospital
and then pronounced dead in the er .
autopsy ?
no . and the body was cremated .
a lot of people dying around maura &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
i just discovered something else about edward .
he &apos;s married .
yeah ?
okay . we &apos;ll need to talk to the wife .
i know where to find her .
i got some information about edward .
okay .
he &apos;s still married ...
to you .
yes , i understand that the annulment papers
were never filed .
what i don &apos;t understand is why .
okay , great . thanks .
for nothing .
sounds like that went well .
an old associate of my vegas divorce lawyer
looked into the situation ,
and it seems the lawyer had a massive stroke
before filing the annulment papers .
well , then it &apos;s official -- you are married
to the prime suspect in our murder investigation .
no , ed-- edward had nothing to do with this .
well , now , that &apos;s just got to be the wine talking ,
because you don &apos;t make definitive statements
about cases without proof .
well , since my husband is a suspect
in an ongoing murder investigation ,
then i must recuse myself ...
which means that i am free to guess , presume , and surmise ,
hypothesize , theorize , even speculate .
knock yourself out , girlie .
god !
edward ...
edward isn &apos;t capable of murder .
he is a good , honest man .
and i would expect nothing less of your husband , maura ,
but we need more than a character recommendation .
we need real proof .
well , i believe that the blood on edward &apos;s jacket
was transfer , not spatter .
okay , what about the gunshot residue ?
it &apos;s minimal .
i think it came from touching the victim ,
not firing a gun .
why would he take the victim &apos;s cellphone ?
to call 911 .
he didn &apos;t make the call .
because someone was shooting at him .
we don &apos;t have proof .
no .
no , but i found a small hole with a rounded edge
on the sleeve of edward &apos;s jacket ,
and it could easily be a piece of buckshot that nicked him .
you &apos;re guessing , maura .
i &apos;m just following my gut , like you do .
well , if you &apos;re right , there would be buckshot in the trees
in the same direction that edward was running .
well , that would be the proof that we both are looking for .
i &apos;ll send crsu back out there first thing tomorrow morning .
so , is there a reason that you didn &apos;t tell us about edward ?
it &apos;s just so far in the past .
and that makes it not important ?
no . no , it just ...
it makes it a really long story .
well , good thing we got two bottles of wine .
we met in college .
he was cute and fun , and , you know ,
we had a passionate relationship for a few months .
and then his mother didn &apos;t think i was good enough for him ,
and she wanted him to marry a debutante .
so elvis and priscilla ran off to vegas .
yeah , that was us being rebellious .
we had a wild weekend , got married ,
and woke up the next day
and realized that we had made a very big mistake .
why was it a mistake ?
because i wanted to go to med school and tilly --
wait , wait , wait . who &apos;s tilly ?
his mom .
she wasn &apos;t gonna allow edward to leave boston to go with me .
so it ended as fast as it started .
are you sure about that ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s still carrying a picture of you
around in his wallet .
yeah , i can &apos;t explain that .
but ending it was the right thing to do for me .
it &apos;s hard to make those life choices , but ...
it was the right thing to do .
are you talking about me and the fbi now ?
no .
good .
you know what i was thinking ?
i bet you &apos;re gonna get a 10 % employee discount
at the fbi gift shop .
okay , now , that is a reason to move to virginia .
i wonder what tilly &apos;s gonna say
when she finds out you &apos;re still married to her son .
oh . she &apos;s not gonna be happy .
that witch controls everything in that family .
witch ? !
wow . now you sound like the angry daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
must be the wine talking .
education ?
just high school and the police academy .
no . when my mom grills you ,
you need to sell yourself more .
what am i -- a used car ?
for the minute , yeah .
well , after graduating with honors
from saint dominic &apos;s high school ,
i ... felt the calling for public service ,
and i enrolled in the police academy .
graduated second in my class .
can you tell me a little bit about your work history ?
for the last three years , i &apos;ve been a homicide detective
with the boston police department .
my conviction rate is over 90 % ,
and someday i hope to be the chief of police .
you do ?
no .
i &apos;m just trying to sell myself .
what about your finances ?
well , i contribute regularly to my ira .
at 55 , i &apos;m gonna be eligible for my full pension
at 80 % of my salary .
health ?
excellent .
any mental illness in your family ?
have you met my mother ?
no , no , no jokes , frankie .
especially about mothers .
all right , no mother jokes .
maybe we should just forget it , act like we &apos;re not dating .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
was your son under any amount of stress ?
not that i was aware of .
well , i know he works for the company .
profits are up , and our customer base is expanding .
the company &apos;s on solid financial footing with edward now .
do you work for the company ?
no .
dunn global holdings has many of their clients
invested in my hedge fund ...
which happens to be at an all @-@ time high .
uh , was there any bad blood
between your husband and your son ?
i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re asking all these questions
about my family and our business .
just routine background information .
did you know michael steele ?
i saw on television that he was shot in the park .
do you know why your son would be associating with
an accountant and a whistle @-@ blower ?
is my son a suspect ?
he &apos;s a person of interest .
in a homicide ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
well , i shouldn &apos;t be surprised .
i saw that maura isles is involved in this investigation .
so this is a way for her
to get back at our family after all these years .
hello ?
oh , thank you , thank you .
yes , we will be right in .
edward &apos;s awake . the doctor is in there with him .
the worst is over now .
oh , i doubt that .
i would like to speak to him .
my son just came out of a coma .
i am not about to let you accuse him of murder .
crsu found buckshot in the trees .
fired in the same direction edward was running ?
well , someone was trying to shoot him .
probably with the same gun .
so michael and edward were both targets .
well , edward was just a little luckier than michael .
well , get the buckshot down to the crime lab .
maybe we can get fingerprints or dna off it if it was handloaded .
i already sent it to kent .
and call jane and let her know she was right . ‬
looks like edward &apos;s no longer a suspect . ‬
no , ma .
what do you think you &apos;re doing here ?
if you &apos;ve come to accuse him of murder ,
i am calling our lawyer .
i &apos;m here to tell you that edward is no longer a suspect .
we &apos;ve found evidence
that he was actually the target of the shooting .
what evidence ?
there was buckshot fired in the direction that he was running .
i don &apos;t give a damn what you found .
i want you to leave my son alone .
your son is now a witness in a homicide .
i don &apos;t need your permission to talk to him .
edward , we &apos;re all very sorry about what you &apos;ve been through .
can you remember anything
about the person that was shooting at you ?
i don &apos;t have anything to say to you .
you understand that you &apos;re no longer a suspect
and we could really use your help ?
i just told you -- i don &apos;t have anything to say to you .
can you leave my room ?
i just don &apos;t get it .
why wouldn &apos;t he tell me who &apos;s trying to kill him ?
‭ well , maybe he doesn &apos;t know . ‬
well , why wouldn &apos;t he just say that ?
i mean , clearly , he &apos;s covering for someone . ‬
well , it sounds like tilly pulled ranks
to protect the family and the firm .
okay , well , that doesn &apos;t make sense , either .
if somebody &apos;s trying to kill her son ,
why wouldn &apos;t she talk to me ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , can you talk to him ?
i &apos;m willing to try .
all right , and you need to convince him
that finding a killer is more important
than saving the family &apos;s reputation .
well , that &apos;s gonna be hard to do with tilly there .
yeah , i know . i got an idea .
aah ! still too hot .
the precise cooking time of this oven seems to elude me .
you start eating ramen in college ?
no .
this is not very popular with the old weegie .
it &apos;s not fried .
no , i discovered this delicious delicacy in the army .
food of the gods .
you need to get out more .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re missing , sergeant . ‬
well , while i &apos;m missing it , could you bring me up to speed
on the buckshot ?
ah , yes . ‬
we couldn &apos;t retrieve any dna or even a partial print
as it &apos;s a commonly used machine @-@ packed ammo .
i was afraid of that .
but i did discover trace amounts of rust
on many of the pellets .
lead doesn &apos;t rust .
no . ‬
i believe the pellets picked up the particles
from a rusty shotgun barrel .
so this got me thinking , &quot; in turn ,
what could the pellets have picked up from said barrel ? &quot;
a curious mind is a wondrous thing .
well , i decided to indulge my curiosity
with further metallurgy tests .
i discovered that the pellets picked up trace particles
of a hardened steel laminate
with a carbon point of .06 .
we need to check with the fbi firearms database .
i did . ‬
this specific steel laminate was used by one gunmaker --
bercotti , between 1911 and 1912 .
there are fewer than 40 of these rare shotguns
still in existence .
did you also find out who in boston might own one ?
ah . that &apos;s where i pass the baton . ‬
that &apos;s your job , sergeant .
i &apos;m happy to share if you like .
another time , maybe .
i have no intention of answering any more
of your questions , detective rizzoli ,
so if you have more questions , contact my lawyer .
i &apos;m so sorry for the disruption .
how are you feeling , honey ?
i &apos;m feeling better .
although i am dying for a cup of chicken soup .
well , then i will walk across the street to the deli
and get you some .
i was hoping you would say that .
thank you , mother .
long time no see .
i recall it being a mutual decision .
you look good .
so do you .
uh , you come all the way down here just to lie to me ?
absolutely not .
okay , so then let &apos;s just agree ‬
that i look okay under the circumstances .
speaking of which , what &apos;s going on , edward ?
nothing , really .
wrong place , wrong time .
you were carrying around our 20 @-@ year @-@ old wedding photo .
i found it in a box the other day .
reminded me of a carefree time .
now who &apos;s lying ?
i think you were carrying it around ‬
because you &apos;re in some kind of trouble
and you thought i was the one person in law enforcement
who you can trust .
you still know how i think .
you still think you can trust me ?
absolutely .
okay , then let me help you .
tell me what &apos;s going on .
my -- my mother &apos;s gonna be back soon .
you want to get out of here ?
after i took over the company ,
i found something in my father &apos;s private accounting ledgers
that i can &apos;t explain .
what did you find ?
my father was making payments to several clients
through an old company of his ,
but he was using funds from our family &apos;s holdings .
well , that &apos;s unethical and maybe illegal .
right , and not anything like my father .
is that why you hired michael steele ?
i thought that i needed a forensic accountant
to get to the bottom of it .
a couple of days ago , he calls me ,
and he says that he &apos;d found out what my father had done .
and so we agreed to get together to discuss it . ‬
why meet at the park ?
i wanted to keep my meeting a secret
until i knew what was going on .
but when i got to the location ...
michael had been shot .
i checked his pulse ,
and i grabbed his cellphone to call 911 .
then somebody shot at me .
i took off running .
did you get a look at the shooter ?
no . he was shooting from the bushes .
falling down that hill --
that &apos;s the last thing i remember before waking up here .
what about the accounting ledger
that you were supposed to go over ?
there was nothing around michael when i found him .
so whoever killed him might have taken the documents
and was waiting to shoot you .
who else knows about these documents ?
i found them on my father &apos;s computer ,
and then i destroyed the hard drive .
but he hid a second copy of the documents at his house .
well , we need to see those documents ,
figure out who &apos;s trying to kill him .
i &apos;m on my way there now .
well , we don &apos;t have a warrant , and , personally ,
i don &apos;t think we have enough evidence to get one .
well , any reason that his wife couldn &apos;t go over to the house
and get the documents and turn them over to the police ?
well , did you tell him you &apos;re still married ?
of course .
and he knows you &apos;re going to his house ? ‬
he gave me a key . he wants me to have the copies . ‬
ooh , i think we &apos;re starting
to see that wild and crazy maura isles again .
see you back at bpd .
ma .
nina &apos;s mom is here right now .
they &apos;re outside parking ,
and they &apos;re gonna be in here in a minute .
oh . mother &apos;s first meeting .
yeah . we &apos;re pretending we &apos;re not dating .
why are you doing that ?
long story .
bottom line ,
nina &apos;s not ready to introduce her mom to her boyfriend .
so why are you two bringing her here ?
she surprised us at work .
and nina introduced me as a coworker ,
and then her mom invited me to join them for lunch , so ...
do not lie to her mother .
i &apos;m not lying to her , i &apos;m just going along with nina &apos;s plan .
yeah , well , moms are smart .
don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna fool her .
we will if you play along .
no .
hi , angela .
hi , nina !
hey !
i want you to meet my mom -- catherine .
hello , catherine . pleasure to meet you .
nice to meet you .
nina was just telling me about you
and how you looked out for her here .
thank you .
well , you have a terrific daughter .
yes , i do . i &apos;m very proud of her .
we &apos;ve been through a lot together and ...
we can tell each other anything .
you know , the thing i admire most about her
is her honesty .
i &apos;m sure you feel the same way about your son .
okay , that &apos;s enough . i know what you &apos;re doing .
she knows we &apos;re dating .
i figured it out the moment i saw you two .
i told you . you know , these kids think we &apos;re stupid .
we ain &apos;t stupid .
but you know what ?
i &apos;m glad we got this little game out of the way .
that way , we can get to know each other better .
yeah .
you don &apos;t mind if i grab frankie for a little chat , do you ?
oh , no . please . take him .
excuse us , dear . this is gonna take a while .
let &apos;s go .
oh , please .
i &apos;ve been researching 1912 bercotti shotguns .
they &apos;re a real rare prize for gun collectors ,
&apos;cause they only made about 500 .
well , there can &apos;t be a lot of those around .
no . only 18 in the united states .
one was auctioned off in boston seven months ago .
guess who bought it .
i don &apos;t believe those belong to you .
i &apos;ll take them right now .
how did you know i was here ?
my son can &apos;t keep anything from me .
well , then you know that he asked me
to hold on to these documents .
and i have decided that it &apos;s best if i have them .
why do you want them ?
let &apos;s just say they &apos;re important to my family .
well , they &apos;re also important to whoever tried to kill your son .
and that person will not stop until they have them .
i just don &apos;t believe that these papers
are more important to you than your son &apos;s life .
i am trying to protect him .
so am i.
and i don &apos;t know what is going on here ,
but i don &apos;t think that edward had anything to do with it .
and i don &apos;t believe that you are a killer .
i can help you , but you &apos;re going to have to trust me .
that &apos;s detective rizzoli .
if i don &apos;t answer , she &apos;s gonna know that something is wrong .
i &apos;ll put it on speaker .
okay ?
okay .
jane , what &apos;s up ?
we traced the shotgun to noah brenner .
it looks like he &apos;s our shooter .
do you know why ?
no , not yet . ‬
but the answer has to be in those papers , ‬
so we need them for motive .
i will bring them back to bpd .
oh , we &apos;re gonna go pick up brenner ,
so we &apos;ll meet you back here .
okay .
now it all makes sense .
it was noah who told edward and me
not to talk to the police .
he was sure there was something in the documents
that would tarnish my husband &apos;s reputation
and destroy our business .
so he asked you to get the documents .
he said he would help me protect the firm .
it &apos;s obvious the only thing he was interested in protecting
was his own ass .
well , whatever &apos;s in these papers ,
he was willing to kill in order to keep secret .
will you help me figure out what that is ?
i &apos;ll try .
what &apos;s going on , angela ?
um , i &apos;m spying on frankie .
i mean with you and me .
uh , i -- i don &apos;t know what you mean .
joann said she ran into you in the park .
yeah , it was really nice to see her .
and she finally told me about the conversation
that you two had right after the shooting .
okay .
and you broke up with me because of what she said .
well , listen , joann was just doing what she thought was best .
i don &apos;t give a damn what joann thought .
well , don &apos;t be mad at her .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m mad at you .
look , joann has a right to feel any way she wants ,
they &apos;re her feelings , not mine .
okay .
and if my being with you ‬
meant that i was at slightly more risk
of getting shot at , then so be it .
it &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take .
i didn &apos;t know that .
so you broke up with me under false pretenses .
so i reject your breakup .
you do ?
yeah .
unless you can stand there and honestly tell me
that you don &apos;t love me the way i love you .
you love me ?
yes .
i do .
stop .
‭ any luck ? ‬
tilly and i figured out what was going on .
how did you get cruella de vil to help ?
i convinced her that we &apos;re on the same side .
what did you find out ?
well , after his father &apos;s death ,
edward couldn &apos;t figure out why his dad had written
large checks out of the family &apos;s account .
tilly recognized that all the checks
went to clients that phillip had put into noah &apos;s hedge fund .
why would he do that ?
tilly thinks there could be only one reason ,
that noah was running a ponzi scheme .
so phillip must have figured out what was going on .
and he was trying to pay back his clients with his own money .
but then noah found out that edward was looking into it ,
and he had to stop him .
and noah couldn &apos;t let people know what edward &apos;s dad
was doing and shine too much light on his fund . ‬
the only way to keep the ponzi scheme going
was keep those documents secret .
yeah , he killed a man to do it .
are you bringing noah in ?
we went to his office , he wasn &apos;t there .
we &apos;re gonna try his estate , and see if we can find him .
don &apos;t , he &apos;s right here .
maura ? maura ? ! are you all right ?
i &apos;m all right .
i &apos;m all right .
the documents are all -- all over the floor .
where are you ?
winchester road ,
just a couple of miles south of edward &apos;s estate .
we &apos;re close .
all right , sit tight . we &apos;ll be right there .
he &apos;s got a gun .
he &apos;s got a gun !
maura !
hang on ! ‬
stop right there !
i want those documents !
you shoot ...
you shoot me , and they go right over the edge with me .
you &apos;ll never have time to retrieve them
before the police get here .
you &apos;re right . we can make a deal .
a deal ?
yeah , a mutually beneficial arrangement
between two reasonable people .
what do you have in mind ?
you give me the documents , and i let you walk .
in order for an agreement like that to work ,
there has to be trust between the parties involved .
what do you need me to do ?
make me understand how a smart man
gets involved in a ponzi scheme .
what difference does it make ?
it will help me judge just how desperate you are .
why do you care ?
desperate people can &apos;t be trusted .
and we agreed that we need to trust each other .
people with my kind of money are never desperate .
we can buy our way out of anything .
until you meet someone as rich as you .
trust me , you &apos;re not as rich as me .
i was talking about edward and his father .
you have the last set of documents .
so my plan is simple --
i either buy you or i kill you .
there &apos;s no other way out for you .
or for you .
and there &apos;s no way i would ever make that kind of a deal .
it &apos;s over , noah .
you &apos;ve forced my hand .
at least i &apos;ll be able to run .
put the gun down . very slowly .
i don &apos;t want to shoot you , but i will .
oh , we wouldn &apos;t want to scratch this beauty .
where did you come from ?
well , those shotguns have hair triggers .
we parked around the corner ,
figured the element of surprise was important .
surprise .
you all right ?
i am now .
where &apos;s my mom ?
oh , she &apos;s downstairs , grabbing a cup of coffee .
she &apos;ll be right up .
why are you smiling ?
because we really hit it off .
how is that possible ?
oh , so did you go with the dark roast ?
‭ it &apos;s great with the hazelnut cream . i really love that . ‬
it is , yeah . yeah .
yeah , right ?
okay , what &apos;s going on here ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , dear .
you &apos;re both standing here like it was fun and games .
because we had a great time .
there is no way he could have stood up to your interrogation
and come out with that smile on his face .
i didn &apos;t interrogate him . we just had a lovely chat .
yeah , she &apos;s right . it was nice , yeah .
why didn &apos;t you ask him all the crazy @-@ ass questions
you asked all of my other boyfriends ? ‬
simple . i liked this one right off the bat .
now , i wasn &apos;t crazy about the relationship deception
you two pulled , but ...
i figured it was all your idea .
hey , how about we all go out to dinner , huh ?
that sounds good . nina ?
yeah , i &apos;d like that . frankie , would you get my coat ?
it &apos;s on my chair .
sure .
you know i love you , right ?
but if you screw up this relationship ,
i will come down on you like a pack of hungry wolves .
i was about to say the same thing to you , sweetheart .
we good ?
we &apos;re great .
great .
okay , so i &apos;m thinking vitello &apos;s .
i think that bump on your head has altered your thinking .
uh , no , i &apos;m serious . i think my mother actually likes you .
tolerates is a more accurate description .
all right . who would have thought
that we would end up here after all these years ?
life is unpredictable .
yeah . i &apos;ll say .
so are you ready to come inside ?
are we really gonna do this , maura ?
it &apos;s been a long time . i don &apos;t think we have a choice .
all right .
the happy couple !
oh , gosh ! look at this cake !
i know . ma went all out .
thank you .
oh , sure .
so what do we do now ?
well , we can &apos;t have cake
until you sign the divorce papers , and -- and i want cake .
yeah .
cake .
cake , cake , cake , cake , cake , cake !
sign &apos; em , maura . ladies first .
okay .
all right .
and by the powers not vested in me ,
i pronounce you happily divorced .
who knew a divorce party could be so much fun ?
let &apos;s never have one , okay ?
okay .
all right , you have to tell us all about maura &apos;s wild years .
come on .
did she ever tell you about the time she tried out
to be a professional female wrestler ?
you &apos;re kidding me .
wwf was in town .
it was her opportunity
to protest gender inequality
in popular culture .
i have to take notes .
no , seriously . she came up with a name .
maura the mauler . she had a costume .
what ? !
you &apos;re so right .
this is the best way to celebrate a divorce .
well ...
you know , i figure a divorce should be
as much fun as the wedding .
thank you for throwing the party .
yeah , sure .
it &apos;s not every day that your best friend gets divorced .
you &apos;ve decided to take the job ,
haven &apos;t you ?
yes , i have .
i think it &apos;s the right thing to do .
i &apos;m proud of you .
really ?
yeah , i know change is hard .
and it &apos;s scary to face the unknown ,
but we have more to do in our lives .
yeah .
thanks for supporting me .
that &apos;s what best friends do .
here &apos;s to change .
to change .
and maybe collared shirts .
no ! no , god , no !
that is never gonna happen --
not even at the bureau .
oh , but here &apos;s some good news .
uh , the employee discount at the fbi in the gift shop --
25 % off .
you know i can &apos;t resist a sale .
