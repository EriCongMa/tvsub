this is from all of us , troy .
when you &apos;re sailing around the world ,
you &apos;ll be going through a lot of countries .
so we got you a universal translator .
cool !
bueno .
bueno ?
cool .
thanks , guys .
i didn &apos;t know going @-@ away parties could be so much fun .
i should leave all the time .
let &apos;s not forget it &apos;s okay to be sad too .
britta , do you get kickbacks from big buzzkill ?
i &apos;m serious .
we know .
the truth is , a member of our family is leaving .
for a year , maybe more .
psychology has taught me the human mind has
a tendency to rechannel separation anxiety in the form
of frivolity and giddiness , and ...
i don &apos;t want us to waste our chance to acknowledge how much
we &apos;re gonna miss you .
attention , greendale .
oh , announcements !
announcements !
oh , i love these .
whoo ! announcements !
i &apos;m standing here with abed nadir ,
who has chosen to give his best friend , troy ,
the very special going @-@ away present of declaring
a school @-@ wide game of hot lava !
cool !
ooh , that sounds like fun !
wha ... no ! process your feelings .
hot lava is the sweet , classic children &apos;s game
in which you are not allowed
to touch the floor , or you &apos;re dead .
i think it &apos;s cute , and while i normally don &apos;t
condone climbing on furniture ,
troy and abed &apos;s friendship has been such
a special and magical part of greendale ,
we owe it to ourselves to honor it .
abed , anything to add ?
yes , take this seriously . stay on furniture .
no books , no bags . the dead can &apos;t talk .
no coming back as a lava monster .
yes !
hot lava !
come on , guys , this is classic avoidance .
i have to go talk to him .
oh , and because the non @-@ awesome
often need incentive to do awesome stuff ,
the final survivor will win my near @-@ mint condition
number one issue of space clone ,
valued by the comics authority at $ 50,000 .
wh ... i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry ?
the floor turns to lava in ten ...
nine , eight , seven ...
did you say $ 15,000 or $ 50,000 ?
six ...
oh , who am i kidding ?
help , lava !
five , four , three , two ...

professor duncan ?
you stay back , britta !
i &apos;m not afraid to push a girl into make @-@ believe lava .
in fact , it &apos;s been my primary strategy .
i &apos;m staying in the game , so i can talk to abed .
i &apos;m worried about him .
what i &apos;m worried about is money .
my self @-@ published novels aren &apos;t going to publish themselves .
don &apos;t regress to primal behavior
just because it &apos;s allowed .
曾邀demi lovato等女星进行封面拍摄
we &apos;re human beings , not the editors of teen vogue .
they &apos;re setting a terrible example for today &apos;s young women .
well , i &apos;m sorry , britta ,
but it &apos;s either you or me ...
and i &apos;m me .
no !
yes , yes , yes !
real nice , winger .
this is why the english never win any sports .
&apos;cause everyone else cheats !
britta , there you are .
sweet , sweet , portable chairs .
plastic gold . four @-@ legged diamonds .
you claiming this ?
lava joust ?
did you all hit your heads on each other &apos;s heads ?
let &apos;s get real , britta .
once the last of the chairs are gone ,
a sofa hopper like you won &apos;t last 20 minutes .
you want to join this alliance ,
or you want to join the lava ?
fine .
but i &apos;m not learning the new names for anything .
centipeding isn &apos;t the fastest form of travel ,
but if we find more chairs ,
we can do the inchworm , scootenanny ,
the reverse danny thomas .
do you think this game &apos;s gotten a little out of hand ?
eh , feels normal enough for a school
that &apos;s on 911 &apos;s blocked caller list .
and i like that abed wanted to send troy off in a cool way .
send him off or put off sending him ?
i think this imaginary lava
might symbolize abed &apos;s fear of change .
i think that diagnosis symbolizes
your lack of a psych degree .
mama mahogany , feast your feet
on that stack of sticks .
eh , too easy . could be a trap .
as if someone else is taking this game
as seriously as you .
let &apos;s keep this centipede rolling .
give me a chair .
ugh , so stupid .
come on .
locker boys !
winger , edison , and perry .
what a delicious ... combination .
what are we getting from this extra level of commitment ?
we &apos;re getting your chairs , your food ,
and the names of your same @-@ sex celebrity crushes .
everyone has one , don &apos;t lie .
then you &apos;re free to go ... into lava !
stand down or meet your doom , chang .
you &apos;re in no position to make threats , floor strider .
our truce ended when
you banished us from the pay phone bench .
you used that bench to upset the balance .
by the vapors of magmarath , we will restore it .
you have gods ?
locker boys !
earn your m &amp; ms !
troy and abed intimidation stance .
i guess that actually looked the way it did in my head .
hiya , kids .
i &apos;m criminology professor buzz hickey ,
and this ... this is just a little something i threw together .
jump !
centipede , centipede !
okay !
pull harder ! pull harder ! pull harder !
my same @-@ sex celebrity crush is nathan fillion !
nathan fillion !
jeff , annie ! get to shirley island .
we &apos;ll meet you there .
abed , save yourself !
abed , before troy &quot; dies in lava , &quot;
you can save yourself emotionally
by honestly experiencing the pain of him leaving greendale !
we can do this in three steps . britta , jump to that trash can .
troy , start inchworming .
what &apos;s the third step ?
the third step &apos;s survival . good luck , britta .
seriously ? troy !
sorry , britta , abed knows best .
but i &apos;ll always remember you as kind of slowing us down
and complaining a lot .
oh , my ... no !
they abandoned you ?
this game &apos;s doing bad things to people .
now me , i &apos;m just in it for the money .
my son &apos;s getting gay married .
the flowers alone , you have no idea .
i get it .
i lived in new york .
all right , miss perry , climb aboard .
it &apos;s fake killing time .
welcome to shirley island .
no furniture beyond this point .
leave your weapons at the door
and any spare doors at the entrance .
then came the now @-@ now times ...
when the floors were covered
with the burny touch .
you made it .
friends !
welcome to shirley island , where all your dreams come true ,
if you dream of standing on a table and pissing in a jar .
where &apos;s britta ?
she didn &apos;t make it .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
poor britta .
it &apos;s okay .
凡夫俗子 基督徒
her sacrifice got us this far ,
and now we can &apos;t lose .
why not ?
because now we &apos;re on shirley island ,
and according to legend ... so is the orb .
i &apos;m sure i have no idea what you &apos;re speaking of .
this is a place of peace .
and profit .
come again ?
you &apos;re not really playing , shirley .
you &apos;re a merchant , and more power to you .
but don &apos;t withhold power from others just to make money .
we want the orb .
abed .
listen , i &apos;m still a little raw from
what happened with britta back there .
i mean , fun is fun , but i don &apos;t want my last day here
to be a day where everyone hates me .
last day ?
citizens of shirley island !
what have you brought to my door ?
stay back !
my god , it &apos;s hickey .
and he &apos;s got chair walkers !
come out with your feet on the floor ,
and there will be no need for nudging or jostling .
i did not skip my son &apos;s birthday for second place !
i want to say something to you guys about mental health .
is that britta ? is she alive ?
why did you think she was dead ?
we kind of ... left her .
left her for dead ?
sounds bad when you put it that way .
can you put it a way that sounds good ?
you do realize this isn &apos;t just a pile of chairs , right ?
this is a crib ,
and you &apos;re curled up inside there , sucking your thumb ,
because you &apos;re too scared to say good @-@ bye .
well , it &apos;s time to grow up .
the adults are here , and we &apos;re gonna tear down your fort .
chair walkers , attack !
my name was vicki ! tell my story !
these are my only pants ! i can &apos;t get them dirty !
i &apos;m actually british !
leonard ! butter &apos; em up !
you got it !
cirque du so long , you high @-@ stepping acro @-@ bastards !
do you have any rolling chairs ?
behind the curtain .
abandon fort ! women and man @-@ children first !
hey , seat feet ! chair to dance ?
yes !
britta , i &apos;m your friend .
i can &apos;t hear dead people , annie .
i &apos;m in a world of imagination .
then imagine what the floor looks like .
i don &apos;t have to . i &apos;ll just imagine
where you &apos;re about to be !
that &apos;s the same as imagining the floor .
then you just admitted that &apos;s where you &apos;ll be .
knock , knock , britta .
i &apos;m not gonna say
&quot; who &apos;s there ? &quot; because someone on the floor is knocking .
well , that &apos;s lame . you have to say , &quot; who &apos;s there ? &quot;
floor !
what ?
that &apos;s who &apos;s there !
yeah !
but it &apos;s for you !
shirley , give us the orb , and we can save shirley island .
the orb can &apos;t save shirley island
because shirley island is the orb .
in a cool way like keyser soze
or a lame way like jewel of the nile ?
you tell buzz hickey that shirley bennett said ...
well , i don &apos;t want to waste your time .
just think of something cool and give me credit .
but the door i &apos;m knocking on is your home ,
so if i &apos;m the floor , it means you &apos;re dead .
if you &apos;re the floor , you &apos;re already dead .
just do it right ! knock , knock !
knock , knock !
who &apos;s there , bitch ? floor !
floor !
troy and abed in a bubble
hickey , you chicken .
he gutted us . retreat !
hello ?
hello ?
i &apos;m the only one left .
i won 50,000 bucks .
that &apos;s 50,000 lottery tickets !
you can &apos;t outrun your emotions !
i had a dream like this ,
but it was sexual .
i will force you two to grieve properly
even if it kills us all !
go away , britta !
sorry about our butts touching .
okay , we &apos;ll go into the vents .
they &apos;ll never find us there .
i say we take a stand here .
i mean , someone &apos;s got to win sometime .
not if we never kill each other .
then we can play forever .
right . wait .
abed , the floor can &apos;t be lava forever .
the game &apos;s got to end .
it &apos;s not a game for me , troy .
i &apos;m seeing real lava because you &apos;re leaving .
it &apos;s embarrassing , and i don &apos;t want to be crazy ,
but i am crazy , so ...
i made a game that made you and everyone else see what i see .
i don &apos;t want it to be there either , i swear .
i want you to be able to leave ,
but i don &apos;t think the lava goes away until you stop leaving .
so the only way i can help you is
by giving up my chance to be one person ?
you guys ready for closure ? - of your caskets ?
guys , stop , okay ? the lava &apos;s real to abed .
it &apos;s not a game to him .
oh , no .
you know what i think ?
i think he &apos;s used to getting his own way .
i think he &apos;s never met me .
abed !
abed .
unbelievable .
when this game is over , i &apos;m gonna shove you back .
abed , give me your other hand !
it &apos;s down to us .
you or britta will be the winner .
i &apos;m not leaving , okay ? just ... i promise .
just ... the floor &apos;s not lava now . just give me your hand .
i don &apos;t think the lava &apos;s here because you &apos;re leaving .
i think it &apos;s here because i won &apos;t let go .
sorry .
bye .
abed .
abed . abed !
abed !
abed ! abed !
abed .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s fake dead .
forever .
el esta muerto para siempre .
shut up .
callate .
what ?
que ?
stop !
para .
he &apos;s not really dead .
no , but he &apos;s really playing dead , and he &apos;s not gonna stop .
here . congratulations , you win .
you don &apos;t get it .
no one gets abed .
i got him a little .
this is my fault .
i don &apos;t deserve to fake live .
wait ! no .
i can fix it .
how ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
in real life , i don &apos;t know , but i can fake fix him .
i can clone him .
i &apos;ll clone him .
go on .
i just need his dna .
let &apos;s get his dna . don &apos;t touch the lava .
you might be onto something .
i &apos;m gonna find discarded technology
from this once great civilization
and start a cloning machine .
okay , i &apos;m placing this cellular regeneration
sequencer on the spot where he died .
here , don &apos;t forget this .
this is a laser guidance system that keeps
the regeneration sequence from , um ... jib @-@ jabbing .
jib @-@ jabbing ?
initiate regeneration sequence .
it worked .
we made a perfect clone of abed .
actually , britta &apos;s work was sloppy .
i &apos;m not an exact replication .
i have all of abed &apos;s abilities and memories ,
but i &apos;m missing his wild emotionality .
although i think i may be able to let troy go now .
i don &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t been completely honest .
i &apos;m really scared to go on my trip .
well , you don &apos;t have to go . your clone can .
right .
so you guys are all cloned up too , huh ?
yeah , believe in cloning .
well , guess that &apos;s my ride .
i &apos;m so excited for you .
you &apos;re gonna see the world
and experience new cultures .
i mean , technically all culture has been homogenized
by 50 years of american imperialism ,
but at least the candy bar wrappers will ...
god , there i go .
almost britta &apos;d our good @-@ bye , huh ?
i &apos;m the worst .
you &apos;re the best , and i love you .
i &apos;m better at sex than jeff , right ?
i &apos;ve yet to have anyone worse .
all i ever wanted in high school was for troy barnes
to notice me , and then i ended up living with you .
i &apos;m pretty lucky .
i &apos;m not .
i had a chance to be your friend in high school ,
but i was too busy trying to be cool .
i missed out on four more years of annie .
you are the coolest guy i know .
i hope i make you proud .
i &apos;ve never stepped foot outside of colorado .
you &apos;re becoming much cooler than me by doing this .
thanks for looking out for me .
thank you for putting up with the boring , old mom
in your college study group .
you made a furniture fortress .
you &apos;re the badass from our study group .
clone troy .
clone abed .
by the way , when i cloned you , i had to patch
some missing parts of your dna with genes from a homing pigeon .
you may notice side effects , like a compulsion to come back .
cool . clone hug ?
so you &apos;re really just gonna pilot this thing all on your own ?
well , pierce &apos;s will stated that someone would be
assigned to travel with me to verify that i don &apos;t cheat .
captain barnes .
we should probably set sail while the wind
is still in our favor , don &apos;t you think ?
engage .
* a gathering of angels *
* appeared above my head *
now , troy , i know it &apos;s gonna be difficult
for you to interact with me ...
no , no . that was the original troy .
i &apos;m his clone .
let &apos;s get the lead out , burton .
aye , aye , sir .
* they said , come sail away , come sail away *
* come sail away with me , that &apos;s ... *
* come sail away , come sail away *
* come sail away with me *
you know , starting a sea voyage from landlocked colorado
may not have been the best idea .
we &apos;ll drive to the river
and then take the river to the ocean .
actually , i never thought i &apos;d see you again .
i have a couple star trek questions , if you don &apos;t mind .
no , go ahead .
what time did you guys have to get up in the morning ?
does every writer write for one character ?
what &apos;s a best boy ? i saw it in the credits once .
why don &apos;t they call it planet trek ?
you never go to a star .
you ... not one episode .
