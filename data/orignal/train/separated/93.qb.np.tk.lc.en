did you know him ?
no , i thought you did .
have you noticed the older mom gets ,
the younger her friends become ?
where do you think she is anyway ?
my bet , she got us here a half hour early
so we wouldn &apos;t be a half hour late .
i hate it when she does that .
you &apos;re missing the point .
i love peter .
you don &apos;t love peter .
stop saying that .
he &apos;s changed , he &apos;s not the same .
oh , my god .
you are one of those oprah women .
i &apos;m gonna take you out back and give you a spanking .
he slept with prostitutes-- that doesn &apos;t change .
why do you and mom keep pushing me toward will ?
the same reason you just brought him up-- hmm ?
you &apos;re tempted .
it &apos;s not a good thing .
your body is telling you something .
oh , my god , stop it .
is that what you tell your students in advanced algebra ?
statistical modeling .
your body is telling you something ?
did you kiss him or did will kiss you ?
both .
mm , i love it when that happens .
it was a mistake .
what happened last time with him ?
why &apos;d you break it off ?
it didn &apos;t seem like it was a long @-@ term thing .
okay , do you see how insane that is ?
you were worried it wasn &apos;t gonna be
a long @-@ term thing so you cut it off before
it could be a long @-@ term thing .
uh @-@ oh , there &apos;s mom . owen ?
don &apos;t say a word .
there you are , you two .
hi , mom .
hi .
i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
mom .
everybody &apos;s in there-- what are you doing in here ?
we don &apos;t know anyone .
of course you don &apos;t-- that &apos;s why i have to introduce you .
so , how do you know him ?
the deceased .
oh , i don &apos;t-- i never met him .
no , no , it &apos;s charlene , the wife .
you know , she &apos;s malcolm &apos;s niece .
she &apos;s a sweet one and she &apos;s got a great haircut .
come on , you &apos;ll see .
she &apos;s got a great haircut .
ms. peterson , i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
thank you . and you &apos;re ... ?
owen , veronica &apos;s son .
he &apos;s the mathematician .
this is the lawyer , alicia .
i &apos;m so sorry , ms. peterson .
thank you for coming .
and thank you so much for offering to do this .
you &apos;re welcome .
we didn &apos;t know who to call .
eugene , this is the lawyer .
hi .
hello .
will you excuse me ? eugene works there , too .
and ... thank you so much again .
we &apos;re incredibly grateful for your help .
what &apos;s this about , mom ?
you &apos;re so generous with your time , alicia .
thank you so much , mrs. florrick .
it @-@ it was just such a surprise to be given a 48 @-@ hour deadline .
i &apos;m ... sorry .
uh , what are we ... ?
could you tell me what we &apos;re talking about ?
oh , uh , yes .
we &apos;re coders working for blowtorch ,
the software developer .
charlene , frank , myself ...
frank ?
the deceased ?
i &apos;m sorry , yes .
we &apos;ve had 18 @-@ hour shifts this week
to get done some new software ,
and frank was driving home for charlene &apos;s birthday
and he fell asleep at the wheel .
oh , my god , i &apos;m sorry .
thank you . so that &apos;s why this contract rankles so much .
it doesn &apos;t protect us on overtime or number of hours ,
and it says we also can &apos;t file suit .
i think they &apos;re worried about charlene suing ...
should they sign it or not-- that &apos;s what they want to know .
well ...
i can pull up some comparable contracts ,
but i really shouldn &apos;t be advising ...
whatever you can do .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s too bad nobody needs free math work .
okay .
let &apos;s try not to kill anyone in the transition .
looks like i have a meeting with a very severe @-@ looking pollster .
so i &apos;m gonna thank you , gentlemen ,
and say good @-@ bye .
hey , matt .
hello , sir . how are you ?
good , it &apos;s been a while .
how was d.c. ?
awful .
uh , will you let me know when my wife is free .
thank you . sit , sit , sit .
i want to thank you for looking over our polling .
you know , i get worried that , uh ,
our internals are being overly optimistic about our numbers ,
and i just don &apos;t want to get caught with my pants down .
you know what i mean ?
i do know .
okay , well , that was ...
that was a very freighted pause .
your internals are overly optimistic .
our pollsters have us leading kresteva by five points .
do you think that &apos;s wrong ?
yes .
where do you think we &apos;re at ?
down by two points .
i &apos;m losing ?
yes .
can somebody ... anybody ... get me eli .
i believe harbot welch oversampled the african american
and youth vote .
the vote is in two weeks and i &apos;m losing ?
yes , now if you could increase
kresteva &apos;s negatives with women ,
you &apos;d be very competitive .
i attack kresteva my own negatives go up .
yes .
but not your wife &apos;s .
i mean , you &apos;re not hurt
if your wife does the attacking for you .
no .
it &apos;s the only way ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t do that .
thank you . one , one minute .
eli , where are you ?
in alicia &apos;s office .
oh . honey , i &apos;m sorry .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good , how are you ?
peter ? are you okay ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m fine .
listen , would you have dinner with me tonight ?
sure , why ?
just a thank you for the charlie rose interview on thursday .
you don &apos;t have to thank me .
i know i don &apos;t have to thank you .
i want to thank you , so ...
how about it ?
8 : 00 downtown in my campaign bus .
okay , i &apos;ll see you then .
hi .
i like that rug .
my mom has one just like it .
thank you .
nancy crozier , what can i do for you ?
actually i &apos;m here to do something for you .
we &apos;re offering a two percent increase to the top 20 .
but that &apos;s it .
i ...
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
mr. jenlowe is within his rights to fire them .
he doesn &apos;t want to , but he runs a business .
we think two percent &apos;s very fair .
nancy , seriously , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
blowtorch .
we were told you were the lawyer consulting with the employees .
we just want them to sign their contracts .
good , i &apos;ll let them know .
and delaying &apos;s not gonna work . we &apos;re in earnest .
&quot; earnest . &quot; good , got it .
i like you , alicia .
i don &apos;t want to see you make a mistake .
i &apos;m not sure what mistake i might make ,
but i am glad you like me .
i don &apos;t like sarcasm .
it &apos;s cheap .
okay , thank you , nancy .
we will be in touch .
we don &apos;t do management labor .
this is not a hard and fast rule .
and if we did ,
it wouldn &apos;t be this piddly @-@ squeak coder stuff .
excuse me , alicia , this case you brought in ,
this blowtorch case ?
we received a cease and desist order from blowtorch .
now , you don &apos;t have to tell us when you take
in a new client-- you &apos;re a partner now--
but when it infringes on territory occupied by chumhum ...
okay , look , i &apos;m sorry this has become a thing .
they are not my new clients .
this is just a really simple favor for my mom .
for veronica ?
how &apos;s she doing ?
uh ... good .
good , tell her ... &quot; hi &quot; from me .
i will .
uh , all i &apos;m doing for these employees is
finding comps for their contract . that &apos;s all .
they think you &apos;re the lawyer .
i know , i know .
i will get this off my desk fast .
it &apos;s just management labor can be a bit tricky .
don &apos;t worry . this will be fast .
but the galling thing is the maternity leave .
there &apos;s none .
90 % of these other contracts have at least one month maternity .
so suggest a month ?
suggest two and they &apos;ll reduce it to one .
at the state &apos;s attorney office , i negotiated down from three .
anything else ?
o.t. for any work week exceeding 60 hours .
and some kind of criteria for performance @-@ based bonuses .
great . thanks , cary .
sure .
lorna , can you get me these in triplicate ?
do any of you get overtime
if your work week exceeds 60 hours ?
do you ?
no .
i just came from a meeting with cary and alicia
and they were arguing it was unfair not to .
as you can see from these other four contracts
from comparable work places with comparable salaries ...
charlene , you don &apos;t need to be here .
it &apos;s okay , i want to be .
mrs. peterson , we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
as you can see from these other four contracts ,
we need criteria for just @-@ cause termination .
yes , except none of those other contracts were for coders .
they cover contract workers , the same as blowtorch &apos;s coders .
eugene ? charlene ?
do you consider yourselves equivalent
to shop workers , pipe layers , and ...
janitorial service personnel ?
aren &apos;t you more like artists ? entrepreneurs ?
why don &apos;t we focus on contractual language ?
these lawyers want to talk in dollars and cents .
but that &apos;s not what your work is about .
it &apos;s about ... magic .
it &apos;s about genius .
then why don &apos;t you pay them like geniuses ?
&quot; them &quot; ? wh ... who exactly is &quot; them &quot; ?
20 blowtorch employees .
they &apos;ve signed on .
so again , if we could now turn to maternity leave ,
you &apos;ll see it as the third ...
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t think we need to go any further .
um , these are letters of dismissal .
blowtorch thanks you for your many years of dedicated service .
wait . excuse me .
and we wish you the best in future endeavors .
this is not the way to handle this .
yes , but it &apos;s the way we &apos;re choosing to handle it .
your desks have been cleared ,
and your belongings have been messengered home .
you are really amazing , you know that ?
i do know that .
we &apos;re looking for artists , not employees .
okay , wait , wait , wait . i &apos;ll sign it .
i &apos;ll sign the contract .
eugene , no .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too late .
we &apos;re worried that your attitude
will infect our other ... artists .
thank you .
it &apos;s gonna cost us votes .
now , we talk about this all the time , let &apos;s just put it to bed .
well , sounds like we &apos;re both having a bad day .
yeah . what &apos;s yours about ?
i just got 20 people fired . how about you ?
they want me to go negative on kresteva .
point out his sexism .
not when you &apos;re up by five points .
everything all right ?
yeah .
how &apos;s your pizza ?
it &apos;s our first date pizza .
and wine out of the bottle .
well , almost like our first date .
almost .
what &apos;s that , peter ?
that is a ring .
but i already have one .
in two weeks , i &apos;m gonna know whether i &apos;m in office or not .
either way , i have a week off .
i want you to come with me to hawaii and renew our vows .
peter .
just consider it .
i don &apos;t know .
why ?
because things are good right now ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;ll stay that way .
it doesn &apos;t mean they won &apos;t .
no .
they never do .
well , all i know is that ...
i love you .
say yes .
you &apos;re at @-@ will employees .
the company can terminate you
for any nondiscriminatory reason .
now , everyone , wait , wait . listen , listen .
there is a safe harbor here .
you can &apos;t be fired if you say you were trying to form a union .
working together in order to collectively bargain is considered pca :
&quot; protected concerted activity &quot; &quot;
you want us to form a union ?
we &apos;re not teamsters .
no , we want you to keep from being fired by saying
you were forming a union .
they can &apos;t fire you if you say that .
really ?
y @-@ yes .
we &apos;ll file a complaint with the nlrb ,
asking them to enjoin blowtorch from firing you .
then you just drag out the process of unionizing .
the whole point is to delay .
they &apos;ll eventually fire us .
no . delay and you &apos;ll get leverage .
it &apos;ll keep them from hiring replacement workers .
i think it &apos;s a good idea .
shake the trees at osha ,
eeoc
and ebsa .
what am i looking for ?
any complaints by blowtorch employees alleging
an unfair or unsafe workplace .
it &apos;ll make it easier to argue that they were unionizing .
organizing ? why should we do that ?
because we &apos;re underpaid and overworked .
and we &apos;ll be out of work if we rock the boat .
margie ?
hmm ?
i thought you were gonna get me lunch .
i @-@ i &apos;m on my way .
the way is this way , not that way .
hello , everyone ,
and thank you for joining us
at the chicago national labor relations board .
i &apos;m administrative law judge rodney jesko .
&quot; rodney &quot; is fine .
or even &quot; rod &quot; &quot;
rod , nancy crozier for the respondent , blowtorch .
and i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m very new to nlrb ,
so if you could just let me know
when it &apos;s my turn to say my piece ?
there &apos;s no need to apologize .
i &apos;m a new judge here myself . just promoted .
really ?
happened a few years later than i thought it would ,
but , uh ... that &apos;s politics .
your honor-- i mean , rod--
we have affidavits from 18 recently dismissed employees
attesting to protected concerted activity under the nlra .
wow . 18 ?
ms. crozier ?
i &apos;m sorry . &quot; nancy . &quot;
i tend to just blurt things out when i &apos;m amazed .
i do the same thing .
my friends are always trying to stop me .
rod , we ask that you enjoin blowtorch
from firing any employees until such time
as we can prepare a case for unionizing .
yes , but , rod , each day
that this labor dispute is dragged on
is a day that my client gets closer to bankruptcy .
how is a handful of terminated employees
trying to get their jobs back going
to mean her client &apos;s financial ruin ?
sorry , i thought these would be more polite proceedings .
uh , yes . so let &apos;s please try to watch our tone .
blowtorch &apos;s financial situation is very precarious
with resources diverted to protracted litigation .
all right , well , then i see no problem
with questioning these witnesses right now
about their organizing efforts .
your honor , we came here merely expecting
to lay the groundwork for our defense .
ah , but wasn &apos;t it oliver wendell holmes who said ,
&quot; speed is a thing that is ...
mightily ... to be wished &quot; ?
can we question your first witness ?
what am i supposed to say ? i can &apos;t lie .
we don &apos;t want you to lie .
we want you to tell the helpful truth .
les neukirk from the department of labor .
and you &apos;re looking for information
on blowtorch industries ?
yes . workplace complaints .
why don &apos;t you ask the employees you &apos;re representing ?
well , we don &apos;t represent all the employees .
oh . um ...
we have no outstanding complaints against blowtorch .
what about past complaints ?
just one in the last 18 months , recently withdrawn .
so , how long have you been at lockhart / gardner ?
me ? uh , a little over a month .
any workplace issues ?
no .
very happy , thank you .
because some people contact me as a cover
for other issues : pay , benefits .
no , good benefits , health care .
everything &apos;s good .
and you ?
happy as a clam .
oh .
well , thank you .
sometimes firms grow so fast ,
issues of wage and hour compliance get overlooked .
no one has to know that you talked to me .
you get health care ?
excuse me .
are you from the department of labor ?
yes .
do you need something ?
just some advice .
do you have someplace we can talk ?
frank &apos;s not even dead 24 hours ,
and we get hit with this contract .
people were outraged . it felt punitive .
and did you discuss collectively taking action
in response to these contract demands ?
sorry to interrupt , but objection .
calls for legal conclusion .
indeed it does . sustained .
did you collectively voice outrage to your boss ?
at that stage , no .
but you did
discuss getting together to have your views known
to someone in a supervisory capacity , right ?
not ...
i mean , in terms of ...
see , we were fired before we could formulate a specific plan .
but you had time to get in touch with me before
you were terminated , right ?
yes . we collectively got in touch with you
at frank peterson &apos;s funeral .
and what exactly did we discuss ?
how we could engage in
protected concerted activity to safeguard our rights .
i &apos;m sorry , but the witness is obviously
regurgitating terminology he &apos;s been fed by counsel .
i mean , objection .
sustained .
when we met at the funeral ,
did we discuss potentially starting a union
to address your contract concerns ?
potentially , yes .
we discussed the potentiality .
thank you . nothing further .
nancy , anything ?
yes . we have one rebuttal witness--
charlene peterson .
thanks for doing this , owen .
i know we &apos;ve never been very close .
well , like i said ,
statistical sampling isn &apos;t really my area of expertise .
i &apos;m just looking for an opinion from someone i &apos;m not paying .
the thing is it looks pretty good , but i can &apos;t ,
i can &apos;t really tell .
i have a speech in a few minutes .
oh . i &apos;ll let you go then .
no , no , no , go ahead , stay .
did you and alicia talk ?
did we talk ? yes .
about me ?
about , um , about personal things .
i &apos;ve asked alicia to recommit to our marriage .
i know you talk with her ,
i know that you and i have had our differences .
but i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m really intent on showing you
that i want to forget those differences .
peter ... this isn &apos;t a campaign .
this is life .
you think i &apos;m campaigning ?
yeah , i read somewhere that
the surest way for a politician
to get you to love him is to ask for something .
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be the opposite :
to give you something .
but , no , voters count themselves so cheap ,
you just have to ask me a favor .
i asked you here because i want things
to be better between us .
so i &apos;d put in a good word for you with alicia ?
yes .
i &apos;d better go .
and , uh , you gotta get to that speech .
she said if we wanted to keep our jobs ,
forming a union was the only way .
mrs. florrick said that ?
i &apos;m going to object on the grounds of attorney @-@ client privilege .
the client can waive that privilege .
i am representing 19 of her coworkers .
she &apos;s effectively waiving it on their behalf , too .
mm , interesting quandary .
how to split that baby ?
by not .
i think i shall side with more inclusiveness .
you may answer the question , ms. peterson .
yes . mrs. florrick said that .
and before mrs. florrick advised you to form a union ,
had you or any of your fellow coders
expressed any interest in doing so ?
we did not .
lorna , can you get me the department of labor on the phone ?
diane and will asked for you .
they ... now ?
yes .
could you close the door ?
we have an insurrection on our hands , alicia . because of you .
the assistants are asking for a raise .
they &apos;re inspired by this case that isn &apos;t a case .
we thought you were giving it up .
yes , the difficulty is
the employer threatened to fire them ,
so we felt obligated .
you broke it , you own it ?
unfortunately . we &apos;re at the nlrb right now .
they &apos;re not gonna get another cent .
these damned assistants .
they think we need them .
the assistants are asking
that we listen to their proposal .
how many assistants ?
eight . why ?
well , they need a third to get a vote on unionizing .
that &apos;s not enough .
they know .
you had a department of labor guy out who educated them .
well , then we need to talk to them .
we need to fire &apos; em before ...
david , alicia ,
you meet with the assistants before they organize .
hear their demands .
and then what ?
hear their demands .
we don &apos;t have the money for across @-@ the @-@ board raises .
we do if we don &apos;t take increases this quarter .
we do if you don &apos;t take any salary this year .
the difficulty , alicia , is
we can &apos;t afford the precedent .
nothing from the department of labor ?
no , no complaints .
charlene really testified against you ?
i think blowtorch has her back in their ranks .
what do you think , a payoff ?
probably . we need some way to prove it though .
i &apos;ll go talk to her coworkers .
cary , did you know that robyn
has health care ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
do you know how much she earns ?
um ... no , how much ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you feeling jealous ?
do you want to know why the widow is testifying for blowtorch ?
yes , i do .
then ask robyn &apos; cause she gets health care .
kalinda .
yeah .
the fourth years are starting our own firm .
we &apos;re taking five top clients with us .
who ?
i &apos;m not gonna say .
i want you to come with us .
sure .
exclusively .
no way .
they don &apos;t value you here .
we &apos;ll value you . you &apos;ll have your own office .
i don &apos;t want my own office .
you &apos;ll be paid more .
okay . then you come up with an offer ,
and i &apos;ll listen .
no .
you &apos;ll just use that to get up lockhart / gardner &apos;s offer .
we need three months to get our ducks in order .
okay , then come up with an offer
when you get your ... ducks .
oh , by the way , the man from the department of labor said
that somebody recently withdrew their complaint against blowtorch .
i would look there .
so you filed a complaint about the hazardous working conditions
at blowtorch immediately following your husband &apos;s death ?
yes .
but then you withdrew that complaint within 24 hours ?
yes .
ms. peterson , were you offered an inducement
by the company to withdraw that complaint ...
objection , rod .
i &apos;m sorry , but this young woman has just lost her husband ,
and this is clearly badgering .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
doesn &apos;t really sound like badgering to me , nancy .
you can answer the question .
they settled .
i was going to sue , but they settled .
rod , we believe
this proves our case .
does not .
actually , nancy , i &apos;m afraid it does .
i find that the coders at blowtorch were attempting to engage
in a protected , concerted activity prior to being fired .
i therefore order that they be reinstated .
but they still need to vote to form a union
in order to retain that protection .
otherwise , blowtorch has an absolute right to fire them .
yes , that is absolutely true .
only if the union is not certified before the court @-@ imposed deadline .
and that is absolutely true .
therefore we would ask for
an expedited deadline of 24 hours .
what ? ! she can &apos;t ask for 24 yours .
hold on , hold on , hold on . compromise .
compromise is the cornerstone of any ...
well , of any building .
so i have made a decision .
the workers are going to get their injunction ,
and the company &apos;s going to get their 24 @-@ hour deadline .
but , rod , 24 hours ...
24 hours is not ...
listen , alicia ,
if your clients were really organizing ,
they should be ready
and able to get this vote together in 24 hours .
jenny , i don &apos;t understand
how half this memo could be misspelled-
just run it through a spell @-@ check .
that &apos;s okay , jenny .
hi .
come in .
you taking over ?
couldn &apos;t do worse .
you already got a five percent raise , kalinda .
we &apos;re not talking about money again this year .
i &apos;m being pursued .
my god , that &apos;s awful .
did you talk to the police ?
and i &apos;m considering taking the offer .
yes , and every time you try this gambit ,
it &apos;s just a little less effective .
who &apos;s pursuing you ?
new firm .
which new firm .
robyn gets health care .
do you want health care ?
well , health care &apos;s equivalent to ...
$ 30,000 a year-- that puts her pretty close to my salary .
she told you her salary ?
no . i can guess .
she &apos;s been here five weeks , will .
i &apos;ve been here five years .
kalinda , health care requires exclusivity ,
and you want your freedom .
i want my value .
why is everybody talking about money all of a sudden ?
what happened to being a family ?
doing things because we &apos;re dedicated to each other .
look , you consider being exclusive to us ,
and i &apos;ll get you more money .
but otherwise , your freedom ...
costs you .
well , is that a yes ?
i &apos;m gonna check with the other firm ,
see if they give me a better offer .
yes , the imaginary firm .
if the vote were right now ,
how many coders are in favor of unionizing ?
i mean , i think our 29 are pretty solid .
and anti @-@ union ?
management probably has about the same number tied up .
so it &apos;s 29 @-@ 29 .
and the swing votes ?
uh , linda kennedy , eric needleman--
those could go either way .
we need them both .
what if we got one and they got one
and it was 30 @-@ 30 ...
you still lose . tie goes to management .
well , it &apos;s up to you ,
all of you , really , to put pressure on these two .
make your case for unionizing .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re taking the time to do this today .
we are all on the same team here .
do you realize that we get paid
ten percent less than staff at other chicago firms of our size ?
no , i wasn &apos;t aware of that .
but this isn &apos;t just about the money .
hello .
don &apos;t mind me . carry on .
um ... you were saying
that there are nonfinancial issues as well ?
yes . it would be nice if we were able to
go see our kids in their school plays or basketball games
without it affecting our performance evals .
alicia , make a note .
any parent whose kid &apos;s playing jean valjean gets the afternoon off .
come on , that &apos;s not ...
okay , we are not discussing solutions today .
this is just an introductory meeting
to lay out everyone &apos;s concerns .
yeah . let me lay out my concerns .
david , please ...
you lay out your top three concerns ,
and i &apos;ll lay out mine .
okay . number one , seven percent pay bump .
that still puts us below the other big firms .
and number two , we would like
to vest in a retirement plan in three years , not five .
never gonna happen .
well , can you at least hear us out ?
why don &apos;t you go to another firm to hear you out ?
are you kidding ? did you just threaten to ...
to fire margie ? yes , i did .
she &apos;s only been with me for 11 years .
you i barely recognize ,
so if you want to go first , or anybody else ,
step right up .
if you terminate margie , we &apos;ll all go on strike .
you can &apos;t go on strike . you &apos;re not unionized .
then we &apos;ll vote to form a union .
you can barely get my lunch order right-- how are you ..
okay , everybody please just calm down , calm down .
18 ? oh , my god ,
they &apos;re gonna draft you any day now .
how sad is that ? you can get drafted at 18,
but you can &apos;t drink till you &apos;re 21 .
i can buy cigarettes .
oh , that &apos;s progress .
and porn .
oh , good , a healthy conversation .
mom really hasn &apos;t gotten a handle on this whole gift thing .
hello , alicia .
mom seems happy .
well , she likes your kids .
for ten years i &apos;ve been
trying to get her to see them-- now all at once .
well , she doesn &apos;t like babies ; they get on her nerves .
how &apos;s peter ?
he &apos;s good . why ?
he ... met with me .
what ?
what does that mean ?
well , he ... met with me about polling .
peter called you up ,
to meet with you about polling ?
yeah . he &apos;s worried he &apos;s not doing well ,
but he can &apos;t go negative on kresteva &apos;s sexism
without hurting himself with women .
what ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i think i might be wrong about him .
he &apos;s sweet ... in his way .
especially now-- he &apos;s very vulnerable .
so , what are you two talking about ?
just these wonderful presents , mother . cock a doodle doo !
i think they &apos;re excellent for psychological role @-@ playing .
so , i &apos;m gonna give zach some wine .
okay with you ?
no .
oh , come on . i let you drink wine at 16 .
i know .
you know , in italy ,
where they give kids wine at any age ,
there &apos;s less public drunkenness than anywhere in the world .
you just made that up , mom .
no , i didn &apos;t . no , i didn &apos;t . look it up .
there &apos;s less public drunkenness in muslim countries
where alcohol is outlawed .
what &apos;s wrong , alicia ?
peter asked her to renew their vows .
can we please just have a conversation between the two of us
without you sharing it with the whole world ?
what , i &apos;m the whole world now ?
peter just wants to tie you down .
i know how he works .
no , see , i @-@ i think we &apos;ve judged him too harshly .
oh . since when ? what happened ?
don &apos;t look at me . i &apos;m just doing the dishes .
i talked to him , and i think he &apos;s grown a lot .
oh , you are so easily swayed .
no , i just , i want my sister to be happy .
and i don &apos;t want her to be happy ?
if you end up with peter ,
in two months he &apos;ll be back with the hookers .
all right , i &apos;m sorry , do you want us to stop ?
no . no , this is why i invite you over .
fine .
peter talks to you ; i &apos;ll talk to peter .
mom ... you talk to peter ,
and i &apos;ll never let you see the kids again .
this is my life .
understood ?
good .
i &apos;m not gonna talk to peter .
sabrina , has eugene kreskoff arrived ?
sabrina ?
eugene said they worked the swing votes ,
kennedy and needleman ,
for most of yesterday , but so did management .
does he have a sense of which way they &apos;re leaning ?
they &apos;re cautiously optimistic ,
but they wanted to make another run at them this morning .
we have a problem .
what ?
kennedy and needleman , our swing votes--
blowtorch just fired them .
they can &apos;t do that .
blowtorch knew linda kennedy and eric needleman
were the swing votes the employees needed to unionize .
and that &apos;s why they were fired .
no . they were fired for cause .
well , first of all ...
good morning , everyone .
good morning , rod .
the two employees that were terminated
called in sick , but as these videos show ,
they were not sick .
these are web chat videos showing needleman and kennedy
discussing wanting to stay away from work .
because they were sick of being intimidated for their votes !
it doesn &apos;t matter the reason . this is blue flu .
they faked an illness to get out of having to go to work ,
and the company is well within their rights to fire them .
not if the company found out by spying on them .
oh , she &apos;s right , nancy-- you can &apos;t spy on your employees .
yes . and if they were monitoring their facebook pages ,
then that would be spying , but this was just routine monitoring .
recording their private web chat ?
which were conducted on company laptops .
oh . these were company laptops .
that they had in their own homes ,
where they had a legitimate expectation of privacy .
i &apos;m sorry ... rod , but i am feeling
a little bit ganged up on here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , nancy .
uh , alicia , cary , could just one of you ...
argue ?
thank you .
the employee handbook is unambiguous , rod .
company @-@ issued equipment is subject to monitoring at all times .
yes . and if the company combed through
every e @-@ mail and web chat that it monitored ,
they &apos;d find other violations , too , but they haven &apos;t .
because this is just pretext .
blowtorch knew those two employees
were the swing votes in a union election .
which is why they stayed home .
that is not why they were fired .
okay . thank you . you &apos;ve given me ... a lot to digest .
and again ... i think what &apos;s best here
is compromise .
thank you .
rod ?
yes ?
what &apos;s the compromise ?
oh . uh , you get your election ,
and the company can fire their employees for cause .
what do we do now ?
we have a little less than three hours before the vote .
we need to pick someone off .
where are you going ?
to pick someone off .
can i talk to you ?
charlene , first let me start by
saying i regret what happened between us in court .
you have suffered a terrible traged ... please just hear me out .
i &apos;m not changing my vote .
do you realize how important this union could be ?
don &apos;t you dare play the &quot; your husband died for this &quot; card .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
could you ... just let me in for a minute ?
okay .
just give me a minute .
hello ?
alicia , hi .
as ms. peterson &apos;s lawyer , i must ask you to desist .
close the door .
if i agreed to exclusivity ,
what would you offer me ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you beat that amount ?
is that what you &apos;re being paid here ?
can you beat it ?
if not , there &apos;s no reason to talk .
i might be able to . i &apos;ll have to talk to my partners .
kalinda ...
i &apos;m not getting in a bidding war with lockhart / gardner .
good to know .
it was a client lunch scheduled
for my usual table at sabatino &apos;s ,
but margie forgot to make the reservation ,
and i had to eat at a table by the kitchen .
jenny &apos;s doing the same to me .
they &apos;re trying to show us how important they are .
are the clients getting wind yet ?
not yet .
they will . the staff is rebelling .
i &apos;m sure if we just make one or two substantive concessions ...
you mean , surrender .
they &apos;re not being unreasonable .
just because you came up short for the blowtorch workers ,
doesn &apos;t mean you can expiate your guilt here .
easy , david .
all right . they see us spending more on infrastructure ,
and they want more .
the problem is precedent .
we can &apos;t pay them all more at the same time .
that &apos;s why we should fire the ringleaders .
i &apos;ll cap margie , you get rid of what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ name ,
and i guarantee the rest of them
will think twice before they complain again .
first of all , that sets us up for years of lawsuits .
then let &apos; em sue . you &apos;re management now .
start acting like it .
okay , wait .
will , we need to split them up , don &apos;t we ?
let me think about it .
you rang ?
i did .
look , if i commit , what &apos;ll i get ?
you &apos;ll be exclusive to lockhart / gardner ?
if i agree , what are you gonna give me ?
what do you want ?
more than that .
is this from your imaginary new firm ?
yup . i need more , will .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re in the midst of a rebellion ,
so any talk of salary increases will have to wait .
who &apos;s rebelling ?
the assistants .
why ? who were you thinking ?
so , when can you get back to me with an amount ?
don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t do anything stupid , kalinda , like leaving us .
look , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be fine with robyn and the support staff .
they &apos;re all family .
was it your intention , ms. peterson ,
after receiving the $ 4 million in company stock ,
to continue working at blowtorch as a coder ?
i &apos;m sorry , rod . objection .
if alicia is intending to use ms. peterson &apos;s recent absence
during this time of grieving to argue
that she &apos;s no longer an employee ...
i &apos;m not arguing that at all .
oh . well , then , objection ...
uh , well , let &apos;s not say overruled .
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s delayed .
this is a copy of blowtorch corporate bylaws .
could you please turn to page 63,
and read paragraph two @-@ a , roman numeral iv ?
&quot; any employee or non @-@ employee owning a minimum of five percent
&quot; of the outstanding common shares of company stock
&quot; shall be entitled to a voting seat on the board of directors &quot;
and given that at the market &apos;s close today ,
blowtorch was worth a little less than $ 77 million ...
well , i &apos;m sure you can do the math .
i see . so , she &apos;s a director of the company ?
yes , rod , which means
she fits the nlrb definition of management ,
and therefore , cannot vote .
alicia , that &apos;s very clever .
thank you , rod .
you &apos;re welcome .
but she has not taken her seat on the board .
no , but the day she took the stock ,
she was no longer qualified as an employee
who could vote in a union election .
well , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true .
but it sounds true .
rod , may i suggest a compromise ?
no , that &apos;s okay . i already have one .
ms. peterson is no longer eligible to vote ,
and the election is to go forward without her .
kresteva is currently ahead of your husband with female voters .
do you think they see in peter
something they do not trust ?
i think it &apos;s because the press has been more interested in peter &apos;s
past failings as a family man , for which he has long since atoned ,
than they are in mike kresteva &apos;s present ones .
kresteva &apos;s present ones ?
that &apos;s an interesting idea .
i mean , what is it you mean specifically ?
running a political campaign is not a one @-@ man show .
for every candidate out there giving speeches and kissing babies ,
there &apos;s a spouse who &apos;s doing everything else .
if everything is perfect ,
it is still tremendously hard on that spouse .
and if it &apos;s not ...
if it &apos;s not , what ?
do you want to draw a comparison between
mike kresteva and your husband ?
mike kresteva is struggling with alcoholism .
it is a serious disease ...
did you talk to her ?
no , this is her .
... and one that he &apos;ll need tremendous support to battle .
but instead of prioritizing his family
and dealing with those issues ,
mr. kresteva has chosen
to throw himself into a political campaign .
if voters are asking themselves
which candidate is more , truly more committed ,
to women and families ,
it &apos;s my husband , peter florrick .
i know it now , and i &apos;ve always known it .
hard to believe she can say that with a straight face , isn &apos;t it ?
ms. loy .
please , call me veronica .
um , okay .
are you here to see david lee , or ... ?
no , i @-@ i just saw him , thank you .
actually , i was looking for you .
is there something i can help you with ... veronica ?
yes , as a matter of fact , there is .
do you love my daughter ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
because if you do ,
it &apos;s time to stop being polite about it .
you have a window , but it &apos;s closing .
that schmuck of a husband of hers wants to renew their vows .
and i know my daughter .
if she does that ,
you &apos;re never gonna pry her away from him .
so you got to move now .
it &apos;s very nice to see you again , ms. loy .
the vote is 29 @-@ 28 .
in favor of , um ... ?
oh . favor of unionizing .
thank you both , so much .
congratulations .
all right . all right , everyone . settle down there , have a seat .
with this election certified ,
this union becomes the authorized bargaining unit
for member coders at blowtorch .
let the contract negotiations begin .
i &apos;m sorry , rod . i don &apos;t think that blowtorch
will be able to participate in those negotiations .
you see , the company &apos;s been sold .
oh , my goodness . really ?
sold to whom ?
i think you know the buyer , actually . chumhum ?
they really wanted blowtorch for the intellectual property
and not the employees ,
so , it &apos;s a good thing they got it so cheap .
did you encourage all the union talk at blowtorch
in order to drive the price of the company down ?
what ?
you brought the case to us .
yes . but after i brought it ,
did you drive the price of the company down for chumhum ?
no .
so , it &apos;s just a coincidence that chumhum bought it ?
i don &apos;t know what it is , but we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
business just does what business does , alicia .
and we &apos;re w running late for a partners &apos; meeting .
good !
ah , the executive committee has arrived .
how is it going ?
i &apos;ve presented our plan to the partnership ,
and i think we &apos;ve come to a consensus
on how to handle the clerical rebellion of 2013 .
uh , before anyone gets fired ,
i &apos;d appreciate at least being able
to speak on behalf of the assistants ?
it &apos;s okay . we had another idea on how to handle this .
in addition to their responsibilities supporting you and david ,
lorna and margie have both been appointed staff coordinators .
and while i &apos;m sure we &apos;re both
gonna miss their very friendly faces around the firm ,
we &apos;re allowing them to telecommute three days a week .
you asked us to listen , so we listened .
and this is what they really wanted .
and the other employees ?
we &apos;ll get to them in time . baby steps .
you bought off the ringleaders .
we handled the problem
in a way that protected us and satisfied them .
it &apos;s what management does .
so , onto the next order of business .
this case based on a lead provided by ...
* so far it &apos;s not bad ... *
don &apos;t come on this bus unless you have good news for me .
i have good news .
i did some polling after the interview .
* the way that you feel ... *
suburban , exurban ...
across the board . kresteva &apos;s lead just got erased .
it &apos;s a dead heat .
it was your interview with charlie rose that did this .
* i &apos;d give up anything to get used to this *
you promise me
that you will never put me through the same thing again .
* i &apos;d give up anything to be home *
* i &apos;d give up anything to be home ... *
alicia ... i promise .
* and i &apos;ve done everything to get into this ... *
then , yes , i would love to renew our vows .
let &apos;s do it then .
