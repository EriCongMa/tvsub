"This is Why We Fight"
There is a procedure to treat epilepsy
that involves surgically severing the connection
between the left and right brain.
The goal is to block signals that cause seizures.
A packet?
We're gonna convince these people
to give us $175 million with a packet?
It's a nice packet.
Mer, Owen stopped calling.
If this doesn't work,
he'll never speak to me again.
Once we buy the hospital, the sneaking around stops.
And once Owen finds out what we did,
he's gonna be the happiest of all.
Derek is completely convin--
The problem is,
this also cuts off the brain's ability
to communicate with itself.
Hey.
Hi.
Good morning.
The left side has no idea what the right side is up to.
The patient may experience problems
with coordination...
memory, speech.
Okay, really?
It's been a week.
What the hell is going on?
You walk out, no warning,
and now the hospital's falling apart.
Yesterday a bunch of nurses walked.
We lost lab techs, support staff.
What?
I mean, if you wanted to screw the Pegasus deal, success,
High five.
But now people are saying that without a buyer,
the whole place could go belly-up in a month.
What are you trying to do?
We--
Cristina.
Fine. Whatever.
It's a drastic solution that's only considered
when all other options have failed,
because once a surgeon makes that cut,
there's no going back.
Shane, have you seen the Chief?
Yeah, he's right over...
I'm too young to be this tired.
At least we still have jobs.
Stop saying that. Hospitals don't just close.
Right?
Chief, the O.R.'s are overbooked.
Seven more nurses didn't show up for their shift today.
Too many surgeries, not enough staff.
Um, do me a favor.
go back up there and see what can be pushed.
Dr. Bailey, you look nice. New suit?
Old suit.
Been in the back of my closet since my last job interview,
somewhere around y2k.
You're going on interviews?
This place is a sinking ship.
This place is not sinking.
We're having some trouble, but we're gonna fix this.
Cahill's convinced Pegasus to come back to the table.
She's having that meeting right now,
and she's going to make this sale.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Whatever you say, cap'n.
Bailey, please.
They're reevaluating their offer
based on all of these walkouts.
We can't afford to lose another surgeon,
most of all you.
Me?
You're the heart of this hospital,
The spirit.
You set the tone that others can aspire to.
This place can't function without you.
Right, Brooks?
What?
Yes. Right.
Fine.
You better be right.
'Cause if this boat goes under
and I don't have a life jacket,
I'm coming looking for you,
fists swinging.
And I'm short, so my punches land low.
I think Dr. Webber's having a stroke.
You need to go.
Where?
Don't care. Just go. Go now.
She's pretty.
Mom.
How was breakfast?
Ah, informative.
If what Richard tells me is true,
it's time for you to come to Boston.
What have you done?
Okay, now just wait a second.
I've seen the kind of garbage
that goes on in a Pegasus hospital.
If your options are either working for them
or this hospital shutting down altogether--
Catherine,
Okay, this hospital is not shutting down.
In uncertain times,
men like Jackson and myself have to stand tall.
We can't pack up and flee at the first sign of trouble.
A man who does not bend to the winds of change
is a man that you can be proud of.
That's poetic.
I'm just sayin', let's slow down
and see how this all shakes out.
I don't think--
Mom, I agree with Dr. Webber,
with--with Richard.
I can't say that I like this at all.
You can push it a day.
It's a tumor surgery on a little kid.
Right, but is he "dying today" sick
or "can't play soccer but still hanging on" sick?
I'll see myself out.
You take Bobby Brinn in for his pre-op scans yet?
Oh, no, not yet.
What about Julie Chang's labs?
Just about to do that.
Are you pissed at me?
What?
I blew you off last night, and you're pissed at me.
I'm pissed because I have 85 million things to worry about
since Robbins walked out.
You hanging out with your boyfriend isn't one of 'em.
I shoulda gone to Hopkins when I had the chance.
I'll get those labs.
Okay, so this time, I'll do the peds and trauma stuff first.
And then I will go into the neuro.
Okay, can somebody else do the closing?
I-I was awful last time we practiced.
No, you were fine.
We really want to end on my flop sweats?
Derek, you do the closing.
I'm sorry. It should be just a few more minutes.
Can I get you any water or coffee?
No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Coffee.
And a bagel or something.
I'm starving.
This meeting was supposed to start half an hour ago.
Okay, he's a billionaire.
One of his minutes is worth 40 of ours.
I can't believe we got this meeting in the first place.
Yeah, nice job, Stan.
I really believe Julian Crest is our guy.
He made all his money in late-stage internet mobile.
Medical tech is the one area he doesn't have a foothold.
Your focus on applied research,
it's right up his alley.
Yeah, well, someone should buy him a watch.
Who are you calling?
Heather Brooks.
Mousy.
Wait. What are you doing?
What happened to not talking to anyone?
I left patients behind. She's keeping an eye on them.
I haven't said anything to her.
I'm giving her advice.
We're all set if you'll follow me.
Oh, okay.
Leave it.
I am not the heart of the hospital.
I'm a chump who didn't quit when she had the chance.
Now I'm stuck cleaning up the mess.
Brooks, you gonna answer that phone?
Sorry.
Oh, it's my mom.
She's going through a rough patch.
Less about your mom.
Right. Okay. Uh, Melissa Keyser, 28 years old.
She's a former patient of Dr. Grey's.
She's been on dialysis but has exhausted all viable veins
and is now septic.
Which means she's done. Ha.
Dr. Grey left me a hopeless patient.
Of course she did.
May as well have left me a pillow to smother her with.
Are you the doctor?
My mom won't wake up.
Dr. Granville to recovery.
You're lurking.
You blame me?
I did it. They're in.
The deal closes at 8:00 A.M. Tomorrow.
Seattle Grace Mercy West will officially
be a Pegasus Horizons Hospital.
I can't--that's-- really?
I told you I was good at this.
There are just a few things to iron out,
so I'll find you when we're done.
Okay, well, I have-- I have a surgery,
But I could--I could come in right--
No, go, go. Be a doctor. I'll find you.
Okay. Hey, Alana?
Thank you.
You are investing in an institution,
a reputation, a legacy.
But Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital
is worth more than its past.
Our plan is to build on that reputation,
to make Seattle Grace a place where medical innovation
is developed and delivered to the patients who need it.
That is our plan.
That is the future of Seattle Grace.
And we invite you to be a part of it.
Neat.
We'll, uh, let you know.
I thought you were taking us to Julian Crest,
not his day care center.
You don't just walk in
and talk to a guy like Julian Crest.
There are hoops to jump through.
Those junior execs like us,
they pass us up to his business development guys.
We impress them, then we see the man himself.
Oh. Will they do this before or after their naptime?
You were golden in there.
There's no way you don't make it to the next level.
I'm telling you, any second now
this phone is gonna ring.
Really, any second now.
Yes, I understand.
What are they saying?
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.
Understand? What do you understand?
Thank you. Thank you very much for your time.
You guys, you were kind of rude.
Well, what did they freaking say?
I'm sorry. You got the meting.
Yes.
Brooks.
Brooks,
what's the story?
I'm sorry, but I'm on Bailey's service today,
and she is not your biggest fan.
Okay.
Melissa Keyser's in septic shock.
Her last systolic was in the 70s,
But Bailey's not ready to throw in the towel yet.
Which is why I've been trying to reach you.
So I found this article on surgeons
crafting artificial arteries...
for patients with exhausted vessels.
Brooks, what are you doing in here with the lights off?
Gotta go, mom.
Bye.
Dr. Bailey, here is the work-up.
Maybe we really do need to look into that smothering pillow.
You know...
I actually think I read an article
about artificial arteries for patients
with exhausted vessels.
Really? Tell me more.
I don't remember more.
Well, then find me that article.
Angry Avery returns.
What?
Your face.
You get all mad and your eyebrows do that thing.
It's cute.
It's my mom.
She's been on me for years to come back to Boston
and take a leadership role in the Harper Avery foundation.
And now she is ringing that bell again--
that loud, very loud bell.
You're leaving?
No. I work here.
Did you prep Mrs. Preston
for the rhinoplasty?
That's been pushed.
Leah says Dr. Hunt's canceling all non-emergent surgeries.
I actually thought that's what angry Avery--
That's the fifth time this week.
I never thought I'd say this,
But maybe my mom has a point.
Okay, Bobby.
So here's the plan--
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna make a small incision
right about here.
Then I'm gonna take Phil
and I'm gonna stuff him in a bag.
And I'm gonna chop him into a tiny million little pieces.
And then I'm gonna yank him right outta there.
And adios, Phil.
Hear that, Phil?
You're going down.
Phil's his tumor.
He was 6 when we found out about the mass.
Bobby heard "Man,"
which, you know, kind of made it easier to talk about.
There's this evil little man inside of him.
Dr. Karev,
can I keep Phil's head?
When I'm done grinding up Phil,
there's not gonna be a head left to keep.
That's so gross.
Just admit it, Dr. Hunt.
My gut's a mess because you screwed up.
Adhesions are unfortunately a normal complication of this--
How can four surgeries in two years be normal?
You're supposed to be in there clearing out my scar tissue.
Instead you keep making more.
Sorry I'm late. I had to do... lots.
And now you're gonna let Tardy Marty
dig around in me, too?
Why do I keep coming back to this chop shop?
Because today we're trying something new,
something we only do with high-risk patients.
Which you certainly seem to be.
Pick up on that, did you?
Andy, this is going to work.
What happens if I get up and walk outta here right now?
The blockages caused by your scar tissue will stay blocked,
and then you die.
Well...
You could've led with that.
Uh, something I can do for you, Avery?
I don't know. Is there?
What?
I think you know something.
I know many things.
The kind of things to get a man talking
about winds of change
and standing firm,
even though it feels like the ground
is about to crumble out from under me?
A week ago, I came across Torres, Yang,
Robbins, Shepherd, and Grey
all having some kind of powwow.
When I asked them what they were up to,
they slammed the door in my face
like I was Diane Keaton at the end of "The godfather."
Hour later, they resigned.
That sound at all suspicious to you?
Sir, something tells me you used to watch
a lot of "Unsolved mysteries."
I solved three of 'em.
This would restore Seattle Grace Mercy West
as the region's leader in adult and pediatric trauma medicine.
Dr. Shepherd?
Yeah, we'll lead the way in neuroscience--
A dedicated research institute
for the advances of brain mapping,
with applications to the treatment of Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease--
May I stop you for a second?
We would love to see a little bit more
on the financials--
Income statements, profit projections,
cash flow...
your allocation of revenue--
perspective payment for MS-DRGs
versus capitation income?
We've got all that...
Yep. Right here. Got it.
Marketing, customer retention plans--
Is there a trend study here?
Yep. One second.
I'm just running it by Mr. Crest.
Mr. Crest apologizes,
but he's leaving this evening for Dubai.
Oh. Okay.
Dubai.
But... he can make 15 minutes for you this afternoon.
Great.
Thank you.
That's good.
Alana.
I didn't expect it to happen this quickly,
but I also didn't expect it to happen this way.
I know.
The board just needs to review their counteroffer and accept.
I called an emergency meeting in an hour.
I would like you to be there when I tell them.
Have you told Dr. Hunt yet?
That Pegasus is buying his hospital for parts,
liquidating its assets, laying off its staff?
I just haven't figured out how.
It isn't pretty, but we needed a deal.
And it's a deal.
Brooks? What's going on?
Is it Bailey?
Uh, it's my fault. It's my fault.
Everybody's gonna lose their jobs
'cause I had a stupid idea.
Oh, no, no, don't.
Nobody is gonna lose their jobs.
Everybody is. Brooks heard it straight from Cahill.
The hospital is liquidating.
The deal is closing tomorrow morning.
Does Owen know?
She didn't say.
All right, so Crest is our last meeting,
and it's our only chance.
In two hours.
Oh, no pressure or anything.
Okay.
Well, if we only get 15 minutes,
then we need to make the most of them, so--
Right.
Right, right. We can't just sit on our thumbs
and let 'em read Stan's boring crap.
No offense.
None taken. It's interesting to me.
We need to know all of this boring crap, too.
All right, so we need to be able to answer
every single question he could ask.
Okay, well, let's divide it up.
Stan, give us all the boring crap you have.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's true. Cahill said--
Brooks...
Okay. Y-you--you just can't say anything to anyone else.
Something like this, it's...
People panic. It's too...
It's too big.
I-I don't understand.
This morning, you called this place a sinking ship.
No, that's different.
I never--never thought it would actually sink.
You keep your mouth shut, you hear me?
They are stripping us for parts
like a busted ass truck.
What, and we're just supposed to believe that
because you got a kicky little haircut?
And also because it's true.
Ugh. I'm gonna be sick.
And I have a surgery.
I'm gonna be sick in my final surgery.
This is not how I wanted to go out.
Jackson might be going to Boston.
I mean, I don't know. Maybe I--
Stop right there.
I know this is really bad, but don't be that girl.
What girl?
That girl who follows her boyfriend across country
like a puppy dog.
I am not that girl.
They were just awarded millions of dollars.
I'd quit my job, too.
No, you wouldn't, and neither would they.
They're not that kind of people.
Oh, that's bull.
They're exactly that kind of people.
They're only out for themselves.
They're probably pooling their money together
for some private practice or something.
I don't buy it.
You want to start a restaurant, you don't use your own money.
And they have no reason to keep that a secret.
I should gone to freakin' Hopkins.
Yeah, that was a bad move.
What do you think's going on over there?
You guys, we cannot say anything.
News like this will just make people panic.
Yeah, no kidding.
I'm panicking.
Exactly, so don't say anything.
Don't say anything about what?
You heard.
Your intern.
Damn that girl. I...
could just grab her by the hair...
What's that?
Oh, I'm...
giving a patient an artificial artery
so that she can stay on dialysis.
Keep her alive long enough
to get the kidney she's been waiting on.
Sounds like fun.
Want to scrub in?
Might be our last chance.
One more for the road.
I thought I'd be chief of surgery someday.
You shouldn't spread that kind of rumor.
It's not a rumor.
I heard it from Brooks. She heard it from--
That is a textbook rumor.
And it's not true. Just ask Hunt. He'll tell you.
He'd never confirm something like that to an intern.
You ask him.
It's not my rumor.
Hey. We ready to roll?
As an academic medical center,
we are currently at 411 beds.
But once we're restored
to a level I trauma center, that number will raise to 500.
Right, increasing revenue streams
for both acute and long-term care.
Pause.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is in Chinese.
Literally in chinese.
Tell Simon I need these in English before I go back in there.
And have Alyse cancel my tee time at Canterwood.
Right away.
Sorry. Go.
Yeah, we're all very--
Did--did Sandy take my luggage already?
I need my charger thingy.
So we're passionate about patient care
and medical advancement.
We want to be the premier hospital in the U.S.
for both.
Your bags are at sea-tac already.
Should we bring them back?
No, that's silly.
Not you. You're great. Keep going.
All right, we would comprise the managing board,
and with you being the primary shareholder, you could--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Stop. Go back.
I thought you were looking for an outright buyer.
You want to run this?
We do.
But we all trained and worked there.
Yeah, we know the place better than anyone.
We've invested ourselves--
Yes. Invested yourselves. I love that.
You have totally done that.
The Shepherd method of viral glioblastoma treatment--
Dr. Grey, your name was on that, too, right?
It was.
You wrote the book on, uh,
scaffold-free cartilage fabrication.
First in your class at Smith, Berkeley, and Stanford.
And Tim Kenner at hopkins won't shut up about you.
Oh, well, um, clearly, you've done your homework.
Yeah, I did.
What I found is, there's not a manager in the bunch.
No administrative leadership experience.
You gotta have someone who can keep the lights on.
Dr. Shepherd was the chief of surgery.
Yeah, for about ten minutes.
Then you stepped down, own volition, no reason given.
What my gut tells me is, you didn't like it.
Surgeons like surgery.
I know when I find something I don't like doing,
I don't do it well.
They're ready for you.
Sorry. I have three meetings before I get on a plane.
Thank you all so much for coming to me with this.
I respect your passion.
I share it.
But I'm not feeling this.
Get someone on your team
with some real administrative experience,
and we can talk.
This is what I've been saying.
We have the experience.
Well, he doesn't think so. So we're--
Don't. Don't do that. Don't do that, okay?
There's still something we can do.
What can we do?
He wants experience. Let's get Richard.
What about the guy who's chief now?
Well, we can't tell Owen.
What the hell difference does it make now?
We need him.
All right, so if we get Richard and Owen, then what?
Do we get another meeting?
Crest is leaving for Dubai tonight.
Well, then we do it before he leaves.
Uh, okay. Well, we can't all march into the hospital.
Well, I'll go. I'll go get Richard.
Okay.
Brooks, if that's your mother on the line, so help me...
Dr. Webber, Dr. Grey is in the waiting area for you.
It's urgent.
Meredith Grey?
Um, Brooks, come over here and assist dr. Bailey, please.
Wait. You're not actually going.
I'm sorry, Bailey. Hurry.
What else?
What else can meredith grey possibly take from me today?
She gave us this fix.
What's that?
She gave us this fix.
She doesn't even work here anymore,
and she's still out there trying to help her patients.
Uh, what the hell are you doing sharing patient details
with someone who doesn't even work here?
She cares.
Oh, she cares?
Now don't you tell me about caring.
I'm the heart of this damn hospital!
All right, these adhesion barriers we're placing
should keep the tissue separate while it heals.
You said "Should " ,
but you told andy that they would for sure.
Right, with a guy like andy,
you tell him the best version of the story.
So what happens if it doesn't work? Ross.
Well, if it doesn't work, then we come back in six months
and we try again.
But we won't be here in six months.
Ross heard a stupid rumor
that the hospital is shutting down,
and now he's apparently having a breakdown.
All right, everyone, I shouldn't be telling you this.
It is still in the works,
but Pegasus is buying this hospital.
And nobody is going anywhere.
You're lying.
He wouldn't lie--
Yes, he would. He just told us that he would.
Only this isn't telling the best version of the story.
It's a flat-out lie.
What are you talking about?
Don't pretend like you don't know.
Pegasus is buying the hospital so they can liquidate it.
We're all losing our jobs.
Would you just tell him it's not true?
It is not. Who said that?
Cahill.
It's okay. Uh, I got this.
He lied then he walked away.
He didn't lie, Ross.
He didn't know.
Have fun in the bag, jerk face.
Morcellator, please.
That's gnarly.
Yeah, bobby would love this.
We could record the live feed.
He could rewatch the carnage. Share it with his friends.
Nah. He'd be expecting arms and eyeballs and crap.
Finding out the truth would break his freaky little heart...
About Santa Claus
and how people get sick and let you down,
and everything just falls apart.
Till then he can believe whatever the hell he wants.
Yeah, you're right.
I mean, I'm a grown-up
and I was still a little disappointed
we didn't find arms and eyes in there.
All right, here we go.
Oh, sick.
Well, that's a very interesting offer, sir.
But I wouldn't be comfortable with...
Really?
That's a--really?
I was able to do some rearranging
and get avery's rhinoplasty back on the board.
He's on the phone with the boston chief of plastic surgery.
Jo was right. You're that girl.
I know.
We're all about to lose our jobs,
and all I can think about is the fact
that I'm gonna have to stop sleeping with him.
I'm so gross.
Come on. The sex can't be that good.
Look at him.
Really?
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Every step you take
is a giant leap backward for womankind.
There goes the right to vote.
ROE vs. WADE.
Cut it out.
Besides, you're just as bad.
You were hung up on Karev for weeks.
Yeah, but you don't want to be like me.
You hate me.
Thanks.
And I don't hate you.
Yeah, you do.
What are you doing here?
I have to talk to you.
Oh, now you want to talk?
You're about a week late. I need to find cahill.
You have to listen.
Owen, is it true,
They're selling the hospital for scrap?
This is the deal you made?
This is the deal you made--
You, Shepherd, and all of you--
when you walked out on me, when you lied to me!
We're trying to buy the hospital.
So we've been looking for an outside investor,
trying to get the money together, but we've hit a wall.
I'm good for $3 million.
No, Richard. We don't want--
No, I just have to move some things around.
It'll be everything I have, but I am in.
No, we don't need your money. We need your experience.
We need you.
I mean, we'll take your money, too,
if it comes down to it, but--
How much do you need?
$175 million.
That's pretty good.
It's not really funny, is it?
No.
So we only walked out to stall the sale to Pegasus.
And it's not over.
We have an investor.
We just need you and Webber to get him on board,
now, before the Pegasus deal closes.
You couldn't tell me this?
Why couldn't you just tell me this?
I could've fought for you. I could've fought with you.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you. I wanted to.
But they said you signed nondisclosures.
And if anyone found out you were involved
in a competing bid,
They could sue you,
or if they were pissed enough, jail you.
Please trust me. I-I...
I was trying to protect you.
You don't need to protect me.
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?
The board.
If they think we can save this place,
it could buy you some time.
You can't take that chance.
Cristina, you need to trust me, too.
Boston then?
No. Not Boston.
My mom wouldn't want to win that way anyway.
But it's probably time
to start thinking about someplace else.
What about you? Where are you headed?
I... don't know yet.
Well, you never know.
We could end up somewhere near each other.
That wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Yeah. Sure.
Suction, please.
Hey, buddy.
They got him.
They kicked Phil's butt straight to the curb.
I wish you coulda seen the look on his face
when I pulled his eyeballs right out of his stupid head.
Oh, dude. It was so nasty.
There were brains and hair everywhere.
Don't forget the intestines.
How could I?
They got all tangled up in my tools
like spaghetti.
We had to take a break just to get rid of all the goo.
What else?
Excuse me.
You okay?
You faking?
Joke's on you.
There aren't gonna be that many more surgeries
for you to con out of me.
You're gonna be fine. There are other programs.
Not like this one.
Not with a teacher like you...
who shows me
cool tumor-in-a-bag surgeries
and thinks it's fun to talk to little kids
about guts and stuff.
You know, I, uh...
I barely saw you this week,
and it sucked.
I'll find another job. Whatever.
I, uh, but I don't want to never see you again.
I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm good.
Thank god Stephanie wasn't here to see this.
Section 15,
allocation of equipment, basically states that
all of Seattle Grace Mercy West medical devices,
radiology equipment, etcetera,
will be distributed between Pegasus' existing facilities
at their discretion-- Dr. Hunt.
You can't take this deal.
Dr. Hunt, can we step outside?
Dr. Hunt, I'm sorry.
It isn't what you want.
It isn't what any of us want, but it is the deal we have.
No, it isn't. I have another buyer.
I'm sorry. I told you. He's not available.
Rita, I'm right here.
Hey, guys.
This is the leadership you asked for--Richard Webber.
Pleasure.
Pleasure.
Richard was Seattle Grace's chief of surgery for 12 years.
Um, can we have a moment to talk to you?
I have to be on a plane in 20.
Can you guys ride with me?
That's fine, yeah.
I only have room for two of you.
Not fair.
So what do we do now?
We go pick them up.
It is a solid capital investor
with a team of surgeon consultants
led by Richard Webber,
Derek Shepherd, Dr. Torres, Robbins...
A group of disgruntled employees.
Grey, Yang, and myself.
Well, where are they, then?
They can formally present their offer to you tomorrow
if you hold off on this sale to Pegasus.
No, you can't do that.
You can't make Pegasus wait--
You all have a choice here.
You can either be responsible for consigning
this world-class hospital to the scrap heap...
There's no choice.
Or...
It's not a deal.
Or you can partner with the doctors
who made this place what it was
and see what it can be.
The Pegasus deal went away once.
If it goes away again, you have nothing--
No severance packages,
no paying off creditors.
You can't make payroll next week.
Nothing.
All we need is one day.
One day.
Do you see them?
There.
Do they look happy?
I can't tell.
Sad?
I can't tell.
I got them to wait.
The board is gonna wait for one more day.
You can make your pitch.
I did it.
We didn't.
Crest met with Richard, liked him,
liked all of us,
then he said no.
Said he just wasn't feeling it.
So it's over.
It's over.
Dr. Kepner?
Andy's awake.
He's got some questions,
and I couldn't track down Dr. Hunt.
Okay. I will be right there.
I just needed some air.
Can I ask you something?
You want to know how something like this could happen?
I don't know.
I guess I-I have to believe
that everything happens for a reason.
It's all part of some... plan,
and you're supposed to learn something.
You lose a patient
because you forget to check their airway,
you don't make that mistake again.
You--you fail your boards
'cause you're too busy sleeping with your best friend,
maybe you stop doing that.
The hospital you call home shuts down,
just when you're finally starting to feel...
like you've got your life together...
Actually, I was gonna ask for a letter of recommendation.
But I could probably ask someone else.
That might be best.
Go on home, Brooks. I'll take it from here.
If it's all the same, Dr. Bailey,
I'd prefer to stay.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with your face?
You're right.
You are the heart of the hospital.
I was, Brooks.
Was.
We're not buying a house.
Hmm. Well, we're not buying a hospital.
We could buy a house...
or build one.
We don't even know where we're gonna be in six months.
So we build it in Chicago or Miami,
or New York.
We have each other,
and we have a beautiful baby so...
we can go wherever we want.
Probably want to sell Mark's place, right?
Probab-probably.
We don't have to move yet, do we?
No.
Not yet.
Vermouth?
That'll have to do.
Oh, and now you're stealing my freakin' booze.
It's just vermouth.
Shut up.
You don't get to make stupid little jokes.
We had a good thing going, all of us.
And now people are losing their jobs,
and it's your fault.
We were trying to buy the stupid hospital.
We were trying to help,
and we screwed up.
I'm sorry.
40-year-old scotch. A patient gave it to me.
Now you're gonna sit down,
and you're gonna freakin' talk to me.
Oh, Derek, it's over. Enough. You have to stop.
Yeah, I know.
Ross asked me to write a letter of recommendation,
and I'm gonna do them for each of the interns.
Did you do one for Heather Brooks?
Who?
Mousy.
Oh, no. Not yet.
I will.
They were trying to buy the hospital themselves.
They... they just needed more money.
They couldn't get it in time.
Well, what are you gonna do now?
Well, I heard Boston's awfully nice.
That thought has crossed my mind a time or two.
I just didn't want to be pushy.
That hardly sounds like you.
I poured so much of my life into Seattle Grace.
Always seemed like a foregone conclusion
that I'd end my career there, and I just...
I'm not ready to retire yet.
I never thought it would be gone before I was.
How much money did they need?
What are you guys...
Folks!
You are right on time.
Come on.
Mom, come on. What is happening?
Have a seat. I'm about to tell you.
There's a reason surgeons are willing to roll the dice
on a risky, go-for-broke,
point-of-no-return surgery
with potentially devastating consequences.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Webber's brought to my attention the fact
that all of you have been looking for an investor
to partner with you in purchasing
Seattle Grace Mercy West hospital.
It is my pleasure to tell you
that the Harper Avery foundation would like very much
to take you up on that offer.
What?
We have only one condition. Only one.
Since the foundation will be putting up
The majority of the funds,
We would like a representative of our choosing
to sit on your board of directors.
My dears, we only have a couple of hours to make this bid.
Do you want to do this thing or not?
Yes. Of course.
Okay, yes. Yeah.
Sometimes...
it works.
Wait, you woke up me at the crack of dawn
to tell me you're coming to Seattle to be my boss?
That doesn't-- oh, no, no, sweetheart. You misunderstood.
The foundation is electing you as our representative.
We're the majority shareholder.
That means you are in charge.
Wait. What?
Now give your mama a kiss, Jackson.
She just bought you a hospital.
