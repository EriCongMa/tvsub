i &apos;ve been after sutter for three years now .
this guy &apos;s one slippery son of a bitch .
wait a second , william sutter ?
he came to me a week ago to take him on .
you cross one line that puts me in jeopardy ,
i &apos;m gonna pull the plug on this whole thing .
i need a large , expensive home in the hamptons .
why are you buying a vacation home ?
because i told tara messer
that i have a property out there ,
and i hired her to remodel it for me .
damn it , harvey , i &apos;m not colluding on this ,
and you &apos;re in here trying to get me
to bring an indictment against your own client .
because when you bring that indictment , i &apos;m gonna beat it ,
and if you don &apos;t bring it ,
and continue investigating my client , i &apos;m gonna sue you .
i think it &apos;s pretty goddamn funny
that you don &apos;t trust me , when you &apos;re the one
that won &apos;t even tell me what you &apos;re in here for .
okay . i &apos;ll do it .
excuse me ?
your pro bono .
bring me the file tomorrow morning .
it was a good fix , sean .
it was a good move , harvey .
want to get a drink ?
why don &apos;t we just have one here ?
why ? as of right now ,
you have no action pending against my client .
but as of tomorrow , i do ,
&apos;cause those indictments are coming down in the morning .
kevin , what did you do ?
i got in a fight with my wife .
i got drunk . i got into my car , and i almost killed someone .
i &apos;m missing 1,000 chances to hug my kids in the morning
and kiss my wife good night ,
all because i couldn &apos;t control myself .
what were you fighting with your wife about ?
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
harvey . what are you doing here ?
mike , sit down . i need to tell you something .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m working on getting you out of here .
yeah , i know you are .
i &apos;m not talking about what we &apos;re doing for cahill .
i &apos;m talking about something else .
harvey , we &apos;re in a room full of people .
you can &apos;t be talking about cahill .
if kevin finds out--
it doesn &apos;t matter if kevin finds out now .
he &apos;s done .
what do you mean , &quot; he &apos;s done ? &quot;
i mean rachel &apos;s dead ...
and kevin killed her .
what ?
it &apos;s true .
you son of a bitch .
you &apos;re lying to me .
goddamn it . he told you he did it .
bullshit .
he got drunk .
he got in a car .
he murdered the woman you love .
stop saying that .
and now you &apos;re going
to be stuck in here with him for the rest of your life .
stop it . kevin would never do that to me .
mike , wake up .
no .
mike .
no .
wake up . wake up .
no !
mike , wake up .
no , no , no , no , no .
mike , wake up .
hey , you okay ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
you sure ?
&apos;cause that was some dream you were having .
i &apos;m fine .
just going back to sleep .
harvey , good , there you are .
what &apos;s going on ?
sutter just called .
let me guess , the indictments came down ?
he wants you in his office an hour ago .
i &apos;ll tell him you &apos;re on your way .
no . tell him you couldn &apos;t reach me .
you want him to start sweating , but why ?
because when people start sweating ,
they start talking to their lawyer .
i &apos;ll tell ray to be on hold .
no , tell him to pull around .
but you just said you weren &apos;t going to sutter &apos;s .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m going somewhere else .
oh , look who it is , the man of the hour .
did you get my indictments ?
i sure as hell did .
now that the party &apos;s started ,
why don &apos;t you tell me what kevin miller knows ?
what are you talking about ?
you went after the guy
to try to get him to flip on sutter ,
so what &apos;d you think he was gonna give you ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you that .
why not ?
because i told you when i started this thing ,
i &apos;m not gonna collude .
we &apos;re not colluding .
it &apos;s called discovery .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what the hell kevin miller knows ?
he developed the trading programs
that sutter claims to use to get his superior returns .
then that program &apos;s got to be full of shit ,
because if it isn &apos;t--
then sutter &apos;s not inside trading ,
which he sure as shit is .
so you &apos;re looking to have kevin testify
that software is bullshit , and sutter knows it .
bingo .
then let me ask you this ,
what exactly did you put kevin away for ?
and why do you need to know that ?
because it might help us figure out
what his weak spot is .
we got him on vehicular assault while
driving under the influence .
are you kidding me ?
why didn &apos;t you think to tell us that ?
why would i ?
mike &apos;s parents were killed by a drunk driver .
and how the hell was i supposed to know that ?
i don &apos;t know . it would have been nice
to know what this asshole did ,
before we sent mike back into a cell with him .
hey , what happened to you this morning ?
what do you mean ?
you skipped breakfast .
i wasn &apos;t hungry .
that all it was ?
what are you talking about ?
come on , mike , you had a nightmare last night .
you &apos;ve been avoiding me all morning ,
and you &apos;re acting weird right now--what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
then why the hell were you in a cold sweat ,
muttering something about someone not finding out ,
and then calling out my name ?
all right , kevin , you want to know what &apos;s going on ?
i had a dream that you killed rachel in a car accident .
that &apos;s probably why i don &apos;t particularly
feel like hanging out with you this morning .
because of what you told me about your parents ,
mike , i &apos;m really sorry .
are you ?
what--what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i mean , last night you told me you almost killed someone .
are you sorry about that ?
you got to be kidding me .
you have a dream , and now you &apos;re questioning
if i feel bad about what i did that night ?
you still haven &apos;t answered whether or not you do .
you know what ? you need to be pissed off
at me to deal with your shit , you go right ahead .
but i feel horrible about what happened that night ,
and for your information ,
the guy that i hit is fully recovered right now ,
and i &apos;m still in here paying for this shit .
break out the champagne , louis .
that house in the hamptons is gonna be yours into 90 days .
they accepted my offer ?
that they did .
well , then i have something much better than champagne ...
wood .
i don &apos;t really see how that &apos;s better than champagne .
of course you don &apos;t .
because you don &apos;t know that i &apos;m having a replica
of my house made for tara ,
so she can see her designs come to life .
louis , that &apos;s actually really sweet .
i know .
now , all i need to do is pick the perfect wood .
i don &apos;t follow .
donna , the kind of wood you get
says everything you need to know
about what kind of man you are .
how hard or soft it is .
how much it bends when you &apos;re working it .
how firm it is compared--
i got the picture , louis .
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
making tara love my wood
is the first step toward making her love me .
okay , louis , calm down .
no .
i don &apos;t really want to calm down ,
because all i can think about my wood .
so tell me ,
exactly how many different kinds of wood
have you sampled in your day ?
all of them .
mahogany , chestnut , walnut , all the nuts .
ebony ?
don &apos;t even get me started on ebony .
when i see ebony ,
all i want to do is put my hands all over it .
oh , god .
i want to live in it .
i want to smack it and hit it , rub it down .
i just want to eat it .
what &apos;s so funny ?
nothing . um ...
i just think that a man needs to follow his heart
and choose the wood that just feels right .
feels right .
yeah .
that &apos;s it . donna ...
i need you to help me feel my wood .
oh , dear god .
god damn it , julie ,
call his office again ,
and this time tell him to find--
if you &apos;re talking about my office ,
there &apos;s no need .
i &apos;m right here .
what the hell took you so long ?
i was unavailable .
well , i just got indicted ,
so from now on you make yourself available .
i get it .
this all just got real for you ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me right now ,
how real is the rest of it ?
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , cahill claims
that you can &apos;t make the returns you do .
you say you can ,
and i want to know how you do it .
we use a proprietary trading algorithm .
developed by who ?
my son @-@ in @-@ law .
good , then we can give it to cahill ,
&apos;cause he just subpoenaed it .
no , we can &apos;t .
why the hell not ?
because the trades on which i make the most money
have nothing to do with that program .
are you kidding me ?
you &apos;re admitting to inside trading ?
i &apos;m not admitting to anything , except that sometimes
i trade with my gut .
well , i got news for you , william .
to a jury , that &apos;s gonna sound like you &apos;re full of shit .
okay , smart guy , pick up that journal .
give me a stock .
nasdaq , new york stock exchange , i don &apos;t give a shit .
just pick one .
all right , computech .
computech .
1.59 billion shares outstanding .
yesterday &apos;s close , 32 , flat .
today &apos;s opening , 33.1 / 4 .
p / e &apos;s at 17 .
earnings expected to grow at 2 % a year .
what it doesn &apos;t say in there ,
is that the earnings aren &apos;t gonna grow ,
because the ceo doesn &apos;t give a shit ,
which makes it a value trap dressed up like a princess ,
and i wouldn &apos;t touch it with a ten @-@ foot pole .
that &apos;s a pretty neat trick , william ,
but it isn &apos;t gonna stop this subpoena .
it &apos;s not a trick . it &apos;s what i do .
what you &apos;re gonna do , is stop that son of a bitch
from getting his hands on my program .
rachel , whatever it is , it &apos;s going to have to wait .
okay , but you told me to bring you everything
i have on the bailey case this morning .
great . leave it on my desk
and i &apos;ll get to it sometime this week .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , jessica ,
i was really hoping that we could go over it today .
i was hoping to be out the door by now .
look , i know that i said
this wouldn &apos;t take up too much of your time , but ...
rachel , i said i would do this , and i will ,
but you just have to be patient .
i understand .
it &apos;s just , leonard bailey &apos;s been patient for 12 years .
and i have sympathy for the man ,
but today &apos;s not the day .
don &apos;t bother with another menu . i &apos;ll just have a cobb salad .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m having lunch with a client
to discuss his investment business .
you don &apos;t represent my investment business .
which is exactly why we need to have lunch .
no , we don &apos;t need to have anything ,
&apos;cause the deal was harvey gets me cleared
of criminal charges ,
then you get the rest of my business .
i don &apos;t care what the deal was , william .
i care what the deal is .
because now that that indictment &apos;s come down ,
harvey is going to be spending all of his time on you .
that &apos;s not my problem .
i &apos;m making it your problem .
we get all of your business , or we handle none of it .
bullshit .
you quit , you lose billables you can &apos;t afford to lose .
we quit , and it looks like we realized
your case was a loser and wanted distance from it ,
which you can &apos;t afford .
you really want to start a business relationship this way ?
i don &apos;t give a shit how it starts , william .
i give a shit how it looks .
oh , that &apos;s why you did this here .
you want it to look like you already represent my firm .
well , look at that .
looks like i &apos;m worth hiring after all .
so are we actually going to talk business ,
or am i just gonna bill you for the pleasure of my company ?
mike , what can i do for you ?
you can tell me if you do straight @-@ up therapy or not .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
i didn &apos;t think i needed to ,
since we &apos;ve been doing straight @-@ up therapy
since you got here .
so , you want to tell me what you &apos;re here for ?
my parents were killed by a drunk driver when i was 11,
and yesterday i found out that
kevin almost killed someone drunk driving .
so i need you to help me act normal around him ,
so that i can get what i need , so i can get out of here .
oh , well , that &apos;s gonna be a problem .
because the goal of therapy
is not to act normal , it &apos;s to be normal .
yeah , well , i &apos;ll be normal when i &apos;m home
with the woman i love instead of dreaming
that the guy i &apos;m sharing a cell with killed her .
what ?
i had a dream last night
that i didn &apos;t have to inform on kevin anymore ,
because he killed rachel in an accident .
and i must have been talking about it in my sleep ,
because he asked me about it today ,
so i told him the accident part , and then we got in a fight .
fight about what ?
i asked him
if he even felt bad about the guy he hit .
so you turned it back on him ?
what is that even supposed to mean ?
it means that i think you picked a fight with kevin
because you didn &apos;t want to think about
why you had that dream .
i know why i had the dream .
it &apos;s because he almost killed someone
the same way my parents were killed .
no , you had the dream , because you don &apos;t want to deal
with what you &apos;re doing to your friend .
oh , this again .
yes , this again .
mike , why do you think part of the dream was finding out
that you didn &apos;t have to inform on him anymore ?
god damn it , i did not come here
to second guess my decision .
do you know what ? i don &apos;t care .
because i wouldn &apos;t be doing my job ,
if i didn &apos;t inform you that actions have consequences ,
and you seem to think that
the only consequence of what you &apos;re doing
is getting out of here early , but it &apos;s not .
i think you don &apos;t know shit about what i &apos;ve been through .
it &apos;s a mistake coming to you for help .
and this is the fifth bedroom ,
and i &apos;m completely open to you knocking down walls
or removing windows , by the way .
no , i love the windows .
they let in so much light .
i agree .
we should add a wall of glass . what do you think ?
i think the place is beautiful ,
and i appreciate you bringing these photos over ,
but when can we go see it in person ?
in person ?
yes , of course .
i need to see the space before i can start drafting anything .
i was just thinking we could work closer together
for the next 60 to 90 days before you started that .
that wouldn &apos;t be productive .
but i couldn &apos;t possibly make it out there
in less than seven to ten business days .
that &apos;s too bad .
i was gonna be out there the day after tomorrow .
i was thinking we could see the space ,
and then maybe go have lunch .
lunch ? together ?
well , i wasn &apos;t thinking of eating in separate restaurants .
ha ! of course you weren &apos;t .
day after tomorrow &apos;s perfect .
but i thought you couldn &apos;t--
i can , and i will ,
and i will meet you at my ancestral home ,
that i &apos;ve owned for quite some time , day after tomorrow .
your honor , i &apos;m simply requesting mr. sutter hand over--
something he has not right to .
i have every right to make sure
that your client is operating within the law .
and what exactly is your basis to say that he isn &apos;t ?
your honor , when you break the home run record ,
and someone says , &quot; your bat is corked , &quot;
you turn it over to show it &apos;s not .
except when that bat is the reason you hit all those homers ,
because the second he gets it ,
everyone in the world &apos;s gonna know what &apos;s in it .
and my client might as well go out of business right now .
that is a ridiculous supposition
without a shred of proof to back it up .
how &apos;s this for proof ?
your honor , six years ago ,
mr. cahill went on a fishing expedition just like this one .
that has nothing to do with this .
doesn &apos;t it ?
he subpoenaed a proprietary trading program
from kessler capital .
it proved no wrongdoing ,
and ten months later they were out of business .
that has nothing to do with my subpoena .
and i have an affidavit here from mr. kessler saying
it was directly because of your subpoena .
mr. cahill , is what he &apos;s saying true ?
did you go after kessler in the same manner ,
and did he go under ten months later ?
yes , but--
no buts ,
do you have any other evidence to present to the court ?
not at this time , your honor .
then your request is denied .
there you are .
what the hell are you doing in the executive kitchen ?
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ? i &apos;m being executive .
but you &apos;re not an executive .
until i made the executive decision that i was .
now , is there something i can help you with ?
yeah . i want you to forget that latte
and get me unfettered access to my new home ,
after thoroughly cleansing it
of any trace of its former occupants .
and why , exactly , do you need me to do that ?
because tara wants to see the house ,
and then have lunch with me the day after tomorrow .
louis , your offer was just accepted ,
and there &apos;s never been a one @-@ day escrow
in the history of escrows .
you don &apos;t think i know that ?
i just spent the last hour
arguing with five different escrow officers .
i get it .
you want me to get people to do things
they &apos;d never be willing to do ,
in a timeframe that makes it impossible for them to do it in .
exactly .
then make me a double latte
and get the hell out of my way ,
because i &apos;m about to executive decision
your sorry ass into that house .
what are you drinking ?
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old bottle of the finest single malt in the world .
then get me a glass .
not until i know what happened in court today .
well , let me put it this way .
the only thing that sean cahill &apos;s gonna be drinking tonight
is a shit @-@ out @-@ of @-@ luck daiquiri .
how &apos;d you get it done ?
i established a pattern of him
going fishing without enough bait .
then have a drink before you get back in there
and knock the bastard out before he can throw another punch .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying ,
i want you to get this entire action dismissed .
william , that &apos;s a terrible idea .
not to me , because he &apos;s got nothing .
i don &apos;t care .
what you &apos;re suggesting is a mistake .
you still haven &apos;t told me why .
because you only get one shot at dismissal ,
and now &apos;s not the time to take it .
well , i say it is . i &apos;m not suggesting it .
i &apos;m flat out telling you to do it .
i didn &apos;t get where i am by letting my clients bully me .
and i didn &apos;t get where i am
by allowing my employees to dictate terms ,
which i already did once today .
i &apos;m not gonna do it again .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means jessica pearson convinced me to give your firm
the rest of my business this afternoon .
so if you don &apos;t move to
have the charges against me dismissed ,
i &apos;ll have her do it for you .
harvey , i was just on my way out .
well , you can be on your way back in ,
because i just came from sutter &apos;s .
i take it he told you about our little conversation today .
if , by conversation , you mean going behind my back
and getting his investment business ,
then yeah , he told me .
i didn &apos;t go behind your back .
i saw an opportunity , and i took it .
well , now he &apos;s seeing an opportunity , and he &apos;s taking it .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s leveraging what you did
to get me to move for an immediate dismissal .
and , don &apos;t tell me , you think it &apos;s gonna work ?
i sure as hell do .
and the second it does ,
mike &apos;s chance at getting out goes with it ,
thanks to you .
hang on there , tiger .
you &apos;re not in this position because of something i did .
you &apos;re in it because of sutter ,
and he &apos;d be demanding you have this case dismissed
whether we have his other business or not .
that &apos;s not the point .
no , harvey , the point is ,
i have been out there busting my ass
trying to find us new business for days ,
and do you know what they keep asking ?
why don &apos;t we have sutter &apos;s investment business .
goddamn right . we needed it .
i got it , and now they &apos;re not asking anymore .
well , what &apos;s gonna happen when we lose this case ,
and his business goes away ?
what happens is , we &apos;re already built back up by then ,
so instead of blaming me
for the position sutter has put you in ,
i suggest you go ahead
and find yourself a way out of it .
rachel , what can i do for you ?
i was hoping you could do something for leonard bailey .
i drafted a motion to reopen his case ,
but i need a current member of the bar to file it .
and what happened to the person you said
was gonna take this on ?
she can &apos;t get to it till later this week ,
but i want to get on this as soon as possible .
rachel , i &apos;m sorry , but i told you before ,
i don &apos;t have the resources to work on this case now .
professor , this man has a wife who gave up on him
and children that he doesn &apos;t see .
his entire life is passing him by ,
and the only way for him to start getting it back
is to just have someone who cares enough about him
that they give him a half hour of their time .
let me see your motion .
this is well drafted .
thank you .
but i &apos;m afraid it won &apos;t work .
what are you talking--no--
look , there &apos;s no reason that he should have been convicted .
look at the evidence .
that &apos;s not the point , rachel .
i &apos;ve worked on dozens of these cases ,
and like it or not , the standard to reopen
is higher than what it says in the books .
you need something undeniable .
then what am i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to use your gumption to find that something ,
and get leonard bailey the justice he &apos;s been waiting for .
harvey , it &apos;s late .
whatever you &apos;re doing here
is gonna have to wait until morning .
it can &apos;t .
why &apos;s that ?
because sutter wants me to move for an immediate dismissal .
what ?
you leveraged me into bringing this indictment ,
and now you want to toss it ?
i don &apos;t want to toss it , but if i don &apos;t ,
he &apos;s gonna find someone else who will .
what are you doing here , harvey ?
nothing , i &apos;m just finishing my dinner .
the thing is , i don &apos;t like to litter ,
so why don &apos;t you do me a favor ?
if i forget this when i go ,
why don &apos;t you take it upstairs and throw it away ?
what &apos;s in the bag , harvey ?
a wrapper , couple napkins ,
and a few extra fries .
what the hell is in the bag , harvey ?
what you needed to keep this case going ,
and i stopped you from getting .
damn it , you said you were gonna defend him
to the best of your ability .
and i meant it .
but i also knew , if push came to shove ,
i &apos;d do what i had to to get mike out ,
and i made my peace with it .
yeah , well , i haven &apos;t .
yes , you have .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;ve been giving me this song and dance about not colluding ,
and it didn &apos;t matter what i said back to you ,
as long as it was something to let you believe we wouldn &apos;t .
because that song wasn &apos;t for me , it was for you .
for me ? bullshit .
i don &apos;t think so , sean ,
because you don &apos;t break a guy out of prison
just to advance your career .
look , this means something to you .
i don &apos;t need to know what it is ,
but it means something to me too ,
so let &apos;s just admit that we &apos;re in this together
and get this thing done .
take that garbage and throw it away .
now can i have champagne ?
you got the realtor to give you the key to the house .
not only that , i got him to agree to take the kellmans
to brunch tomorrow from 10 : 00 to 2 : 00
to celebrate their big sale .
well , that is great , donna ,
but i don &apos;t just need to get into the house .
i need tara to believe that it &apos;s my house , which means--
no lock box on the door ,
no for sale sign in the yard ,
and no personal belongings in the house ,
which is why we are gonna be there at 10 : 01
to stage the shit out of that place .
and these are coming with us .
you reframed pictures of bruno ?
in the style of the house .
and not just bruno ...
mikado .
that &apos;s perfect , donna .
i just thought showing tara your wood
wasn &apos;t the only way to show her what kind of man you are .
thank you , donna .
you &apos;re welcome , louis .
since when do we get a room
instead of having to use those damn phones ?
since i officially became part of your legal team .
my legal team ?
that &apos;s right .
the firm that i work for is taking your case .
after all this time .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but we still need to get the case reopened ,
and to do that we need to find something new .
so where do we get that ?
i was going through the state &apos;s case file ,
and i read your police report .
you said there was a woman with you that night
who can testify that you didn &apos;t kill that couple .
that &apos;s right , maria ,
but that &apos;s not new .
well , it &apos;s new as far as the court &apos;s concerned ,
because it was never admitted at trial .
well , let &apos;s admit it .
it &apos;s not that easy .
i need to understand why it was never admitted .
because the damn woman up and disappeared before my trial .
my lawyer didn &apos;t do a thing .
you had an alibi witness ,
and your public defender let her get away .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying .
maria could have told the jury that i didn &apos;t do it ,
instead no one told them .
two weeks later , i &apos;m in here ,
and i &apos;ve been here ever since .
is there anything else i need to know ?
then i need to find maria gomez .
look , man , please , i really don &apos;t want to talk .
good , &apos; cause i want you to listen .
when i was a kid , i thought we had it good .
and we did .
had a nice house , nice neighborhood .
except for one thing .
turns out my father ...
was a criminal .
one day he got caught . he went to prison .
my whole life fell apart .
how old were you ?
15 .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
i hated that man for doing what he did to me ,
so i did what messed up 15 @-@ year @-@ olds do .
started acting out .
acting out ?
brother , i was on my way to a place worse than this .
finally , my mom made me see someone ,
and he helped me realize that if i didn &apos;t change ,
i was gonna ruin my life .
so i straightened out and turned my life around .
and that &apos;s why you do what you do .
yeah .
why are you telling me this ?
because the way that man got through to me
was to open up about himself ,
and i realized that if i really want to help you ,
i got to do the same .
all right , i dragged this out as long as i can ,
but i &apos;m pretty much done drafting this motion .
so i &apos;ll need you to proof it--
harvey , before i do that ,
i think you should take a look at these .
what is it ?
cahill issued subpoenas
to deposition william sutter and kevin miller .
that sneaky son of a bitch .
why are you smiling ?
because last night i went to cahill
and tried to give him sutter &apos;s trading program .
you did what ?
it was the only way i could see
to stop the case from getting dismissed ,
but he wouldn &apos;t take it .
and this buys you time .
it does , if the judge waits to rule on our motion
until after cahill conducts these depositions .
harvey , even if that works ,
what if cahill doesn &apos;t get enough from the depositions
to keep the case alive ?
then mike &apos;s chance of getting out of prison is gone ,
which means cahill &apos;s not the only one
that needs to use this to try and get something .
i have to admit , ms. zane ,
when you said you were looking into the bailey case ,
my interest was piqued .
that was a long time ago .
well , you &apos;ve obviously come a long way
since your public defender days .
you don &apos;t exactly see the best of humanity at that job ,
which makes it one you can only do for so long .
but you didn &apos;t come here to be my therapist .
no , i came to talk about maria gomez .
what about her ?
i &apos;m curious as to how you can have
an alibi witness on a murder case ,
and your client ends up on death row .
because i didn &apos;t have an alibi witness .
i had a no @-@ show who vanished into thin air ,
and i didn &apos;t have the resources to find her .
and you didn &apos;t think to ask the police at trial
why they didn &apos;t follow up on leonard &apos;s alibi ?
i did think of it ,
and they would have said what they always say ,
&quot; every murderer claims to have an alibi , &quot;
and if i couldn &apos;t produce her , why should they ?
well , you could have at least asked for postponement ,
to have time to find her .
and i would have , except for one thing .
i wasn &apos;t sure a drug addict with a prior conviction
would have done leonard bailey much good .
that &apos;s about her character , not the facts of the case .
her character is a fact of the case ,
and when i pressed her as to what the two of them were doing
at the time of those murders ,
she admitted they were both on meth ,
and it wasn &apos;t the first time .
which , by the way , might have something to do with
why she never showed up at trial .
so you can try to reopen this case if you want , ms. zane ,
but i am telling you ,
you &apos;re wasting your time .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is , the clock &apos;s ticking .
sutter wants me to get the case dismissed .
what ? if that happens , i &apos;ll--
i know .
now , listen to me .
i bought us a little time ,
but i need you to do something .
okay .
what is it ?
sutter doesn &apos;t know this yet ,
but he and i are gonna be here tomorrow
to have a practice deposition with kevin .
so i need you to do the best
sean cahill you have to get them talking .
you want me in the room ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
didn &apos;t you hear me ? we &apos;re running out of time .
i heard you , but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
for me to be in the same room as kevin right now .
the drunk driving .
you knew ?
i just found out .
well , then you also know
it &apos;s probably not the best time for me to chum up to him .
i &apos;m not asking you to chum up to him .
i &apos;m asking you to piss him off .
what are you talking about ?
kevin knows something ,
and he &apos;s not talking .
so we could sit around here for the next two years
waiting for him to tell you , or we can light a fire
under his ass by reminding him
that sutter &apos;s out there ,
while he &apos;s in here .
now , are you with me or not ?
i &apos;m with you .
i take it you &apos;re here to give me the good news .
i &apos;m afraid not .
i thought i made myself clear .
if you don &apos;t make a motion to dismiss this--
i did file a motion to dismiss ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because cahill filed subpoenas
to depose you and your son @-@ in @-@ law first ,
and until those depositions happen ,
the court won &apos;t file on the motion .
goddamn it .
how the hell did he know to do that
when we &apos;re about to have the case thrown out ?
i don &apos;t know , but that &apos;s not what i came here to talk about ,
because we need to get you and kevin miller
in a room to prepare you for your deposition .
you want us to go to prison ?
i don &apos;t see any other choice ,
so you should call whoever it is you were gonna meet this morning
and tell them you can &apos;t make it ,
because you and i are going to danbury .
were you really serious about wanting to help me ?
why do i get the feeling that &apos;s not a simple question ?
because i want to know if you &apos;re willing to give me access
to certain records .
i &apos;m sorry , mike , i cannot give information on other inmates .
that &apos;s okay , because those aren &apos;t the records
i &apos;m looking for .
did you find maria ?
you know , i haven &apos;t even started looking for her yet ,
because you lied to me .
what ?
i didn &apos;t lie to you about shit .
well , you certainly didn &apos;t tell me that you and maria
were high the night of those murders .
who told you that ?
georgina casey .
you went to see my old lawyer ?
yes , i did .
and now you sitting over there looking at me like ,
&quot; you know , maybe he could have killed those people after all . &quot;
leonard , when i went into that meeting ,
i was on your side .
and you came out of it off it .
no , when i came out of it , i had questions .
okay , ask them . i got nothing to hide .
really ? because you hid something from me the last time .
that was different .
no , it &apos;s relevant .
no , it isn &apos;t .
you were high the night of the murders ,
and you lied to me about it .
because i &apos;m ashamed of how i used to be .
i was a high school dropout on my way nowhere ,
so , yeah , i looked for an escape
when i could afford one .
i &apos;m not saying i didn &apos;t make some mistakes
or maybe even commit a few crimes ,
but killing those kids was not one of them .
and that &apos;s the truth , but i guess it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because if you don &apos;t find maria ,
someday they &apos;re gonna walk me down that hall
and put me to death .
then i guess i better get back to finding her .
but , leonard , i &apos;m telling you ,
if you &apos;re not straight with me ,
this isn &apos;t gonna work .
then i won &apos;t ever leave anything out again .
this is ridiculous . this kid &apos;s no sean cahill .
this kid made sean cahill look like a fool
without even having a law degree .
just so you know , when you attack opposing counsel ,
it kind of makes you look afraid .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
okay , then why don &apos;t you tell me this ,
what &apos;s the best thing about having so much money ?
what ?
you heard me .
you got the penthouse in manhattan .
you got the villa in the south of france . you get two yachts--
so what ?
so what ?
so i wouldn &apos;t want to give all of that up .
would you , mr. miller ?
me ?
yeah , you .
i mean , you had use of all of these places too ,
until you threw it all away driving drunk , that is .
what ?
objection .
irrelevant .
i think it &apos;s very relevant .
for all i know , kevin could be somehow involved .
that &apos;s insane .
that &apos;s insane ?
you &apos;re the developer of the trading software .
and i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s on trial here .
then let &apos;s talk about the one who is .
how do you feel about the fact that your father @-@ in @-@ law
never came to visit you in prison ?
excuse me ?
you heard me .
he hasn &apos;t come to see you once . how does that make you feel ?
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
he could be lying on a beach in the french riviera ,
while you can barely see your wife and kids ,
and that doesn &apos;t matter to you ?
mr. miller &apos;s family has nothing to do with this investigation .
mr. miller &apos;s family is the subject of this investigation ,
and his father in law clearly doesn &apos;t give a shit--
i &apos;m grateful for everything kevin &apos;s done for me ,
and he knows it .
yeah , right .
i &apos;m sorry , what was that ?
are you disputing the fact that he &apos;s grateful to you ?
i &apos;m not answering that question .
this isn &apos;t getting us anywhere .
he &apos;s getting you ready for cahill .
i wouldn &apos;t have to get ready for cahill
if you did your goddamn job and got this case dismissed .
that &apos;s right , get someone else
to cover up your mess like you always do .
you got something you want to say to me ?
i got something i want to do to you .
you better remember who you &apos;re talking to .
i know exactly who i &apos;m talking to ,
the guy who doesn &apos;t give a shit
about anyone else other than himself .
that &apos;s enough .
that is enough .
this is your trial .
it &apos;s not mine , and i &apos;m done with this ,
and i &apos;m done with you !
guard .
son of a bitch .
i knew that kid would be a problem .
relax . that &apos;s the whole reason i wanted mike in here .
if kevin gets any funny ideas ,
mike &apos;s gonna calm him down and let us know .
you guys really get under each other &apos;s skin , don &apos;t you ?
you have no idea how many times
i thought about punching that bastard in his smug face .
i &apos;m guessing he &apos;s thought about punching you too .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
it means his daughter married a criminal .
he &apos;s got to live with that .
you know what ?
i &apos;ve had just about enough of you
giving me shit for what i did .
well , maybe i &apos;ll stop giving you shit
when your story starts adding up .
excuse me ?
you said you got three years for drunk driving ,
but you got no priors ,
and this guy made a full recovery .
99 times out of 100 , that means you &apos;re getting probation .
then i guess i had shitty representation .
bullshit .
money like yours doesn &apos;t buy shitty representation .
then i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
how about you start with telling me the goddamn truth ?
you want to know the truth ? i &apos;ll tell you ,
because i &apos;m sick of holding it in , man .
i got three years , because when they offered me a deal
to turn on him , i said no .
you had to turn them down . he didn &apos;t do it .
no , i had to turn them down ,
because he &apos;s not the only one involved .
what ?
you asked me why i was drinking that night .
it was because i found out the thing that i worked so hard on
to get that prick &apos;s approval was nothing but a lie .
your trading program .
yeah , my program .
turns out he wasn &apos;t using it at all .
he was just insider trading the whole time .
okay , so you got home , you told jill ,
and she didn &apos;t believe you .
no , mike .
she not only believed me , she ...
she already knew .
she was in on it .
yeah .
so i went out , and i got drunk .
and the next thing i knew ,
i had to choose between going to prison for three years ,
or the mother of my children going away for a whole lot more .
kevin , you got--
okay , i have removed
every possible trace of the kellmans &apos; existence
and replaced it with yours .
now all i have to do is fill the refrigerator with prune juice ,
and then i &apos;ve got to set up the--
okay , get out .
what ?
what do you mean get out ? i haven &apos;t set up the--
she &apos;s pulling up . she &apos;s here ,
and i don &apos;t want her to see us together
and get the wrong idea .
and exactly what idea is that ?
okay , don &apos;t you understand ?
no woman could compete with you ,
if she thought there was even a chance
of you and i being together .
really ?
no , she blows you away .
now , get the hell out , and use the service entrance .
tara , you &apos;re here .
oh , my god .
louis , this place is wonderful .
how long have you had it ?
had it for generations . great @-@ grandma litt ,
she used to make wool right over there by the fire .
the natural light is phenomenal .
phenomenal .
and there &apos;s a wildness to the landscape ,
an uninhibited energy .
wild . uninhibited .
it &apos;s perfect for us , louis .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
i don &apos;t just like it . i love it .
just like i love you .
oh , tara , i love you--
what ?
it .
your idea ... what you were talking about earlier .
which idea ?
what happened ?
louis , are you okay ?
what the hell is going on here ?
nothing &apos;s going on here .
what the hell are you doing in my house ?
your house ?
louis , who are these people ?
these people are the registered owners
of this property .
you mean the one you said had been
in your family for generations ?
that &apos;s a lie . we built this house ourselves ,
and until five minutes ago , we were gonna sell it to him .
tara , i can explain .
i don &apos;t need you to explain . i &apos;ve heard enough .
tara , wait . please .
tara , please wait .
you know , i &apos;ve heard about people like you .
you &apos;re trying to get free design work out of me ,
so you can decide whether or not you want to buy this house .
that has nothing to do with it .
really ? because , first ,
you tried to get me to work on this
without even seeing the space .
then you lured me out here under false pretenses .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what , exactly , is going on here ?
i lied to you about owning a house in the hamptons
so i could spend time with you .
what ? why--why would you do that ?
because you are perfect , and beautiful ,
and intelligent , and talented ,
and so far out of my league .
it was the only thing that i can come up with to find the time
i needed to make you fall for me .
you were willing to buy and remodel an entire house to do that ?
i was .
that &apos;s the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
really ?
yeah . yes , really .
tara , would you like to have dinner with me ?
i &apos;d love to , louis .
what are you working on ?
an engagement letter .
you got a new client .
i got us two new clients .
so that &apos;s what you had to do the other day .
well , something like that .
the one i got the other day led to the one i got today .
that &apos;s great .
yeah , what &apos;s on your mind ?
i know you said that you &apos;d give me
an hour of your time later this week ,
but i need that hour tonight .
rachel , it &apos;s been a long day .
can we talk about this in the morning ?
no , jessica , we can &apos;t .
leonard bailey &apos;s execution date &apos;s been set ,
and i don &apos;t know how to tell a man that he &apos;s going to die .
you know , i always knew
that jill and i were from two different worlds .
and she was a sutter , and i was just--
a guy who was good with numbers
and didn &apos;t have much else ?
figured it was only a matter of time
before she came to her senses ,
but she never did .
well , let me guess , william never accepted it .
no . so when he asked me to develop that algorithm ,
i thought , &quot; this is my chance . &quot;
and when i gave it to him , he acted so proud .
started calling me his genius son @-@ in @-@ law .
but i was really just the world &apos;s biggest sucker ,
because i let that son of a bitch get one over on me ,
and i &apos;ll regret it for the rest of my life .
what if you could get one over on him ?
what are you talking about ?
you said yourself , they offered you a deal .
i bet they &apos;d still take it .
no way . if i give them him ,
they go after her .
not if you get them to give jill immunity first .
no .
kevin , you have to--
it &apos;s too big a risk ,
and you &apos;re my father @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s lawyer .
you can &apos;t be saying this .
i am nobody &apos;s lawyer ,
i am your friend . and i am saying--
well , my answer &apos;s no , and i want your word , right now ,
that you won &apos;t tell anyone what i told you .
kevin , please , you &apos;re not--
mike , i &apos;m serious .
no one can ever know anything about what i told you .
you have my word .
did i ever tell you my mother was a teacher ?
first grade .
everybody always said she was the best teacher
their kid ever had .
she loved it .
she also always dreamed of seeing spain when she retired .
that was supposed to be six years ago ,
but then the state teacher &apos;s pension fund
decided to invest its money with william sutter
she died last year , still working .
and every year , i tried to pay for her trip ,
but she just wouldn &apos;t let me .
sean , why are you telling me this ?
because a judge decided to rule on your motion to dismiss after all .
which means we &apos;re out of time ,
and you didn &apos;t just come here to tell me about your mother .
no . i came here to ask for that trading program .
