how you doing today sir ?
very well , thanks .
thank you .
i hope you &apos;re not admiring your own work .
i wish i was . but i got a pretty good alibi .
i was working with you yesterday .
i &apos;ll be sure to back you up
when we talk to the lamson gallery .
the curator is waiting for us upstairs .
i love a good art heist .
solving a good art heist .
that &apos;s what i said .
let me see that .
lewis thayer &apos;s &quot; untitled # 2 . &quot;
it &apos;s worth $ 4 million .
you &apos;d think for that kind of money
he &apos;d have bothered to come up with a title .
it is one of his seminal pieces .
is it a fad or talent that drives up the price ?
both . neither .
don &apos;t try to understand the peculiarities
of the pop @-@ art market .
would you pay $ 4 million for that ?
&quot; pay &quot; ?
yeah . you &apos;re the wrong guy to ask .
miss jeffries , i &apos;m special agent burke .
this is neal caffrey .
how you doing ?
tell us what happened .
well , as you can see ,
the &quot; untitled # 2 &quot; was simply cut out of its frame .
how does someone pull a down @-@ and @-@ dirty slash and grab
from a major gallery ?
it &apos;s one of the few options left if you want to knock over
a high @-@ security --
i was talking to her .
mr. caffrey &apos;s right .
we have sensors in the frame ,
but nothing attached to the canvas .
cutting it out of the frame circumvents the alarms .
got it .
security cameras ?
the theft occurred during our daily security @-@ tape swap .
so we &apos;re not dealing with complete amateurs .
no . actually , it sounds like a pretty good plan .
what are the odds you &apos;ll be able to recover the painting ?
well , it would have made my job a lot easier
if you had kept it from the press .
we did .
somebody didn &apos;t .
anonymous tip .
do we think our thieves called it in ?
good chance . headlines attract black @-@ market buyers .
which means they want to move the painting quickly .
i can ask around .
good . run your street contacts .
diana , you &apos;ve got europe . check with interpol .
jones , you &apos;re on asia . check with the alat over there .
yep .
what ?
do you mind ? i need to check my street contacts .
calling mozzie ?
he &apos;s good at this kind of thing .
you sure he didn &apos;t do it ?
slash and grab .
frame &apos;s too high .
yeah .
hello ?
hey , moz , the lamson is missing a thayer .
i didn &apos;t steal it .
i know .
reward ?
sizable .
all right . i &apos;m on it .
what are you doing here ? i said meet me in an hour .
and you found a source in less than an hour .
that &apos;s pretty quick , moz .
i only deal with professionals .
and you asked about a reward , which you never ask about .
so i &apos;m starting to think you &apos;re talking to somebody else
and not telling me .
you &apos;re paranoid .
who &apos;s your fence , moz ?
i &apos;m friends with many people of unsavory character .
mm @-@ hmm . how long you been talking to her ?
i know not of who you speak .
sorry . meeting aborted . my sources spook easily .
they have to think i &apos;m a vault .
meeting aborted !
sounds like the meeting &apos;s still on .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this .
i saw a mockingbird in the park .
what color was the mockingbird ?
the bird died . let &apos;s go .
what are you doing here , alex ?
i &apos;ve never known you
to go skulking around after reward money .
well , after the plane blew up ,
a lot of people were asking questions .
i &apos;m trying to stay off the radar .
makes it hard to find work .
you came to mozzie , not to me ?
he &apos;s not tethered to the fbi .
two taps meant &quot; abort , &quot; by the way .
or you could have just yelled &quot; abort . &quot;
i found the missing thayer painting .
it was fenced in dubai .
thanks .
but you didn &apos;t come all this way just to say that .
what are you really doing here , alex ?
i needed to talk to mozzie .
alone .
what did i do ?
we &apos;ll talk .
we &apos;re not friends anymore ?
what &apos;s up , peter ?
got news about the painting . meet me in the office .
on my way .
got to go back to the office . we &apos;ll talk later .
what are we talking about ?
i &apos;ve got a big problem .
yeah .
great , great . overnight it .
i found the painting . how did you find it ? i found it .
where ?
it was fenced to a textile magnate in dubai .
a hotel heiress in budapest just turned hers in .
good news .
you found the painting overseas .
scotland yard has it .
it &apos;s also in dubai and budapest .
what ?
they &apos;re forgeries .
all of them ? how do you know ?
because customs clamps down when a theft occurs .
the risks of getting the original out are too high .
but if you make forgeries ahead of time and take them
out of the country before the heist , you &apos;re in the clear .
steal the thayer ,
leak the theft to the press , then sell the forgeries .
and the original never leaves the country .
you &apos;ve seen this scam before ?
i know someone who --
allegedly .
allegedly pulled it off before .
we have a copycat on our hands .
who are they copycatting ?
me .
so you confirmed these are all forgeries .
yes . all of them .
neal ?
neal ?
i don &apos;t think our forger went off a photograph .
i think they stood in front of the original
when they painted these .
how do you know that ?
thayer used the &quot; ben @-@ day dots &quot; method to show shading .
he spread paint across a paper stencil
and pushed it against the canvas with a brush .
the shadowing in these paintings is more deliberate .
it &apos;s minute , but these dots grow starker at the bottom .
the forger probably started these in afternoon light ,
when the color was slightly more red .
they also didn &apos;t realize they caught the painting
when the light was pouring directly down on it ,
causing a deeper contrast at the bottom .
there &apos;s no lighting overhead .
was this painting ever hanging below that skylight ?
yes . in late april . we had a pop @-@ art show .
we wanted to display the thayer prominently .
then we should check the registration log for april .
probably looking for a student --
talented but still experimenting with technique .
someone like justin magary from east side university .
he stopped by on the 21st of april at 1 : 45 .
that would be afternoon light .
what &apos;s that on your face ?
i haven &apos;t seen you this happy in a while .
you know , it &apos;s a beautiful day .
you &apos;re excited someone &apos;s copycatting you .
imitation , flattery -- you know what they say .
mm @-@ hmm . you ever been on a campus ?
not as a student .
and yet you have three mbas and two doctorates .
clearly something wrong with the system .
too bad you faked it .
they could have made copies of you
and filled up a frat house .
oh , are we bitter we weren &apos;t invited to the party ?
oh , it &apos;s just with my father &apos;s construction salary ,
i had to stick to the grindstone .
four years of advanced math on scholarship ,
then two years of accounting .
i still can &apos;t imagine you hunched over a desk
with a little visor , doing my taxes .
you &apos;re lucky the fbi hires mathletes .
i was not a mathlete .
i was an athlete who was good at math .
yeah . we fraternity guys call you &quot; nerds . &quot;
so , why &apos;d you forgo school and go to new york ?
sorry , but we &apos;re here to interrogate someone else .
see what you missed out on ?
i &apos;m reconsidering my position on college .
focus .
peter ...
justin magary ?
yes ?
we need to talk to you .
why ?
what do you know about lewis thayer &apos;s &quot; untitled # 2 &quot; ?
uh ... nothing .
i @-@ i mean , i know it , of course .
you ever painted one ?
it &apos;s a good question .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say anything .
we &apos;ve got you on a camera
sketching it at the lamson gallery in april .
that &apos;s legal , right ?
not when three of your copies are fenced as the real thing .
that turns them into forgeries ...
which is illegal .
i can vouch for that .
it &apos;s looking pretty bad for you , kid .
if you talk to me , i can help you .
a while ago , i answered an ad on the school &apos;s list server
for reproductions .
i get an e @-@ mail back commissioning seven copies
of &quot; untitled # 2 . &quot;
seven ?
did you wonder why somebody would want seven copies ?
you know how hard it is
to make money as an art student doing art ?
who hired you ?
i didn &apos;t meet them .
they dropped the materials off in my mailbox .
and once i &apos;d finished ,
they said to leave the paintings in the rec center
and that the money would be left in my box again .
i thought it was weird that they didn &apos;t want to meet ,
so i -- - so you stayed and watched the pick @-@ up ?
yeah . i wanted to make sure it was legit .
and she seemed normal , so i let it go .
all right , if you sat down with a sketch artist ,
do you think you could remember what she looked like ?
may i ?
yeah .
this is her .
my fault ? ! it &apos;s your fault !
this would never have happened if you kept a lower profile !
that &apos;s why i work in code .
anything i can do ?
i don &apos;t need your help .
she needs your help .
alex ?
someone &apos;s looking for her .
who ?
she thinks it has something to do with the music box .
why ? - well , she thinks --
just let her talk .
i don &apos;t know who , but they &apos;ve got a powerful reach ,
and they &apos;ve turned over a lot of stones .
all right , what can i do ?
krugerrands ?
i needed the money to disappear .
i hooked her up with someone who deals in krugerrands .
i &apos;ve been fencing some in increments .
who &apos;s the guy ?
russell smith . old friend from detroit .
some friend -- russell found out someone &apos;s looking for me ,
and now he &apos;s gonna sell me out .
i need you to shut him up .
short of killing him , i &apos;m open to ideas .
all right .
give me some time . i &apos;ll figure something out .
you know i won &apos;t let anything happen to you .
thanks .
she comes to you and not to me ?
far be it for me to act as therapist , but ...
maybe alex doesn &apos;t want to see you heartbroken over kate .
or maybe it &apos;s the tracking anklet .
sure , the anklet .
found our girl .
justin &apos;s got talent .
if ever we &apos;re short a sketch artist , i know who to call .
who is she ?
veronica naylon .
did she send the e @-@ mail ?
can &apos;t be sure .
the account &apos;s defunct , and the address was generic .
both the ad and e @-@ mail account were created
at the school computer lab , so anyone could have done it .
here &apos;s her work @-@ up .
junior , majoring in archaeology ,
mediocre grades , no priors .
how does an average 21 @-@ year @-@ old student
from the upper east side pull this off ?
you think she has accomplices ?
maybe this is where she met them .
she &apos;s an archaeology major ,
but she &apos;s currently acing a criminology class .
it &apos;s the one class she &apos;s pulling an &quot; a. &quot;
how appropriate .
oh , if you like that , you &apos;ll love this --
syllabus for the class .
oh .
he &apos;s gonna be impossible after this .
where &apos;s neal ?
oh , look at you .
you &apos;d think being copycatted
was like winning the crime oscar .
what ? i &apos;m not allowed to revel ?
all right , take me through your version of this scam .
how many players are involved ?
you &apos;d need a forger , a thief , and a couple fences .
not the kind of thing you &apos;d pull off by yourself ?
not unless you can be in multiple places at once .
i mean , it &apos;s a sophisticated job .
i doubt justin or our mystery girl thought of it themselves .
no ,
but they might have figured it out by studying you .
our mystery girl , veronica --
she &apos;s acing a criminology class .
here &apos;s the syllabus .
they spent a week on me ?
apparently you &apos;re one of the interesting criminals
of the 21st century .
&quot; a new breed of forger , technological virtuoso . &quot;
wow . &quot; with a classical artistic foundation . &quot;
they got it .
yeah , yeah . i read it .
oh , they covered the antioch manuscripts . did you see that ?
yeah , i know . relax . they only covered you for a week .
by the end of the year , they probably won &apos;t remember your name .
well , obviously , a few of them will .
you think she formed a crew in this class ?
people have been known to fall for a pretty face .
if veronica had help ,
i don &apos;t want to scare them away by my talking to her just yet .
well , i can talk to her .
now you &apos;re reading my mind .
anklet ?
i &apos;ll pull it for this one .
you ready to go back to school ?
i think i can handle that .
good .
&apos;cause i &apos;m a technological virtuoso .
okay .
with a classical artistic foundation .
okay , okay . read it to yourself .
quiet now .
did you guys see this syllabus ?
oh , we don &apos;t need to share .
i &apos;m in it . yep . go , team !
the koechert diamond pearl
was stolen by gerald blanchard in 1998 .
it took them a full two weeks
to realize that the jewel was missing
because blanchard replaced it
with a pretty darn good costume replica .
he circumvented the alarms ...
... at the viennese castle
by parachuting onto the roof , if you can believe it or not .
some people have called this the perfect crime .
i wouldn &apos;t say he was perfect .
and blanchard overshot his landing .
he , uh , slipped on the tiles
but saved himself by grabbing a railing
on the castle &apos;s roof .
so i &apos;d say he loses marks for style .
excuse me ...
i believe we have a celebrity in our midst .
this is mr. neal caffrey .
to what do we owe the honor , sir ?
i understand you study the best criminals .
i share that interest .
you -- you seem like a very capable teacher .
oh , please .
you know , you would be a far better t--
hey , why don &apos;t you --
could you come up here and answer some ques--
class , wouldn &apos;t you love
to have neal caffrey up here , teaching ?
come on .
we would love to have some of your expertise .
pleasure to have you .
pleasure to be here .
please ...
all right , well , we &apos;ll stick to the hypotheticals
and anything covered by the statute of limitations .
who &apos;s first ?
oh , wow . all right .
how about you ?
in theory , the carrier pigeons only delivered
the vault combination -- they didn &apos;t carry the manuscripts .
next question ?
when executing a heist , mr. caffrey ,
do you prefer boxers or briefs ?
i think some things are better left to the imagination .
there &apos;s not much written about your arrest .
how &apos;d you get caught ?
momentary lapse in concentration .
so the fbi had nothing to with it ?
oh , they &apos;d like to take credit for it ,
but essentially , i turned myself in .
recently , you were suspected in the la joya diamond heist --
suspected and then cleared .
i served my four years ,
and i decided i didn &apos;t want to go back .
been living like all you ever since then .
or trying to .
okay . let &apos;s thank mr. neal caffrey .
thank you .
remember , everybody ,
read chapters 12 through 15 of lovell for next week .
thank you so much , mr. caffrey . fascinating .
it &apos;s the least i could do .
you know , i thought
i should participate in my own copyright infringement .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s a little green
to rip off someone &apos;s con unless you improve it .
you and your kids could use a little tutoring .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
the thayer theft .
hey , don &apos;t get me wrong , man . i &apos;m flattered .
but , uh ... i &apos;d like to be cut in .
you know , i did lay the groundwork .
well , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint you ,
but i &apos;m a professor who teaches crime .
i don &apos;t go out there and commit them .
okay .
mr. caffrey ...
um , i get together with a group of students after class .
yeah , you got some bright kids in here .
yeah , there &apos;s a few of them .
we go to a bar called the globe , around the corner .
be thrilled if you would join us .
the globe ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll think about that .
i think you might find it interesting .
have a great day .
thank you . and thanks again .
thank you .
so the fbi had nothing to with it ?
oh , they &apos;d like to take credit for it ,
but essentially , i turned myself in .
think we &apos;ve heard enough .
suddenly i don &apos;t feel bad about telling you this .
you &apos;re not the only person they &apos;ve been copying .
what ?
seems those who can also teach .
we cross @-@ checked all of the crimes
on professor oswald &apos;s syllabi
since he started teaching 10 years ago .
we suspect he counterfeited a bank note last year ,
forged an emerson letter , and smuggled egyptian artifacts .
he copied tokley @-@ perry ?
well , felony by proxy -- you got to give him credit .
we also think that he might have stolen
matisse &apos;s &quot; view of saint @-@ tropez . &quot;
matisse ? that &apos;s a serious payday .
unfortunately , this is all speculation .
oswald is taking advantage of his students ,
and justin is going to go down for this
unless we can prove it wasn &apos;t him .
well , we have one card left .
we know about the thayer . oswald &apos;s hiding it somewhere .
he &apos;s not gonna give it up soon .
interpol found the fences who sold the forgeries abroad .
they know they &apos;re being watched . they &apos;re out of play .
so he &apos;ll need a local fence .
you have something in mind ?
maybe .
what &apos;s the fbi &apos;s policy for drinking on the job ?
good .
okay , show us something else .
bet you another $ 20
i can drink this shot without touching that hat .
you &apos;re on .
done .
you didn &apos;t drink it .
done .
that &apos;s not fair !
oh , i didn &apos;t say it was fair .
i said i could drink it without touching the hat .
i &apos;m only mildly impressed .
this is all small @-@ time .
you guys , uh ... you want something bigger ?
manny , i think i saw a $ 50 in your wallet . can i have it ?
why ?
you &apos;re paying with $ 100s , manny . i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll miss it .
just give him the $ 50 .
hey , where &apos;s my wallet ?
how did you do that ?
always make your lifts with two fingers .
that way your thumb doesn &apos;t bump up against the mark .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
and never , never think
you &apos;re the smartest guy in the room .
unless you &apos;re the smartest guy in the room .
oh , uh , you want to keep your place in that deck ?
keep the tip of your little finger in the brief .
i think i know what i &apos;m doing .
want to put some money on that ?
sure .
who &apos;s the mark ?
that &apos;s my $ 50 .
how about her ?
hi , i &apos;m eric .
alex . nice to meet you .
alex , pick a card .
this looks like fun .
so , put it back on top and cut it for me , would you ?
okay .
okay , now , the card i stop at is gonna be yours .
he doesn &apos;t think it will be .
he &apos;s wrong .
200 bucks says he &apos;s right .
no . i can &apos;t take your money .
why not ? you can &apos;t make bets with girls ?
and that &apos;s your card .
and , no , it &apos;s not .
well , that was supposed to be your card .
now , i guess he was right .
sorry .
i believe this is her card , eric .
she and caffrey played you .
she &apos;s his , uh , &quot; inside man , &quot; if you will .
nice catch .
look , we weren &apos;t gonna take your money .
yeah , right .
check your pocket .
i guess the lesson here is never con a con man .
i think we all know what the lesson is for today , don &apos;t we , eric ?
yeah . yeah , i guess i &apos;m not the smartest guy in the room .
congratulations . you humbled him .
that &apos;s not easy to do .
i &apos;m , uh , professor george oswald .
alex hunter .
hi .
what do you do besides card tricks ?
she &apos;s in the moving business .
well , nice to meet you .
if you want to join us for a drink ,
the next round is on eric .
nice to meet you .
be right there .
thank you for backing me up in there .
mozzie tells me to come to the bar because you have a plan
and now i &apos;m out 200 bucks and you &apos;re dropping my name .
do you trust me ?
no .
okay , i assume we &apos;re doing more
than baiting frat boys with bar tricks .
what &apos;s with the dead poets society in there ?
you know , it &apos;s my current case
and the solution to your problem .
russell wants to meet on sunday
to fence the rest of the krugerrands ,
but it &apos;s a setup .
he &apos;s gonna sell me out to whoever put the price on my head ,
and your plan is to bring the feds into it ?
i tell the fbi that
oswald and his kids are gonna steal the krugerrands .
they &apos;ll pull russell in and talk to him .
it will kill his reputation .
no one will be buying information off him
if they think he &apos;s in bed with the bureau .
you &apos;re crazy .
it &apos;ll work .
you &apos;re crazy .
are you in or are you out ?
i &apos;m in .
the kids do the legwork .
oswald fences the goods
and kicks them back a share of the profit .
if the kids get caught ...
oswald can sell them out .
yeah , he &apos;ll say he was teaching a class ,
and they took it too far .
he &apos;s more slippery than you are .
thank you .
do you think you can get him to reveal the painting ?
i don &apos;t know .
they spent the night talking about the next best heist .
which way are they leaning ?
everything from diamond heists to stealing boats .
but i think we can choose for them .
how so ?
i happen to know a petty crook
who &apos;s moving krugerrands on sunday .
gold krugerrands ? of course you do .
his name is russell smith .
bingo . racketeering , extortion , robbery .
and i don &apos;t like him .
we intercept russell with the krugerrands ,
send jones down the street with the coins ,
and i get the kids to steal them from him instead .
we can watch them , follow the case back to oswald .
tell me more about this guy . how do you know him ?
he &apos;s a friend of a friend .
mozzie ?
you can convince oswald and the kids to go after him ?
i can still be slippery .
i &apos;ll get them to convince me .
if jewels are the target ,
what are the challenges of extraction and export ?
how do we buy enough time
to get the jewels out of the country ?
it &apos;d be cool to pull a blanchard --
buy a replica the day before and replace it with the real thing .
we could tunnel .
i &apos;m not really big on shovels , manny .
would you excuse me ?
everything is all set , okay ? ! you can &apos;t back out now !
okay , look , keep your voice down , okay ?
he saw me , it &apos;s over .
you can &apos;t walk away . i already have a buyer .
then get someone else to make the grab ,
or tell your buyer to back off .
so i &apos;m out a ton of money
because you made a stupid mistake and got spotted ? !
yes .
thanks for nothing , caffrey !
what &apos;s she talking about ?
i think she &apos;talking about money .
that &apos;s good , that &apos;s good . now walk away .
can i slap you ?
i bet that hurt .
sorry about that .
that &apos;s a little awkward .
lovers &apos; quarrel ?
we have a history .
you know , we just -- we don &apos;t work well together .
sounded like a certain job went away .
i &apos;m reformed , remember ?
yes , of course .
all right , listen , um ... i have a class to teach .
so , why don &apos;t you keep brainstorming , and , uh ...
remember , in this theoretical discussion ,
there &apos;s no better teacher than this man here .
all right ? see you all later .
you know , you can tell us .
what &apos;s your history ? former girlfriend ?
something like that .
sounds like she has got a job for you ,
but you went and got spotted by the target .
you heard all that from over here ?
well , she can be a little loud .
no , look , guys , it &apos;s just a melon drop , okay ?
i &apos;d tell you , but you &apos;d say it was small @-@ time .
well , what &apos;s the take ?
krugerrands .
gold .
you &apos;re sure the kids will be there ?
yeah , they &apos;ll be here .
they think this is gonna be the easiest score they &apos;ve ever pulled .
oswald better show .
he will .
the kids get me the krugerrands , i drop them in the locker ,
and oswald delivers them to his fence .
just like that ?
just like that .
russell is headed your way .
our courier has arrived .
russell smith ?
fbi .
that &apos;s -- i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t do anything .
i need you to come with me .
krugerrands . where &apos;d you get these ?
they fell off a truck .
i want to talk to my lawyer .
of course . what honest man doesn &apos;t ?
you ready for this ?
born ready .
dude , watch where you &apos;re going !
i &apos;m sorry about that . here , let me help . hold on .
hey , get your hands off my stuff .
what &apos;s going on ?
do you know how much i paid for those groceries ?
here comes manny .
this guy runs into me , and now he &apos;s trying to pocket my stuff .
look , i &apos;m not trying to steal anything .
okay ? i &apos;m just trying to help you out here .
just hit and run me , then .
calm down . he &apos;s trying to help you .
just listen to the lady . handle it yourself , okay ?
how about that ? walk along !
yeah , jones deserves an oscar .
manny &apos;s approaching the drop .
smooth . i &apos;m glad he &apos;s on our side .
caffrey is headed toward the lockers .
how &apos;s it going ?
so far , so good . you &apos;re a convincing mark .
well , wait till they find out what i do for a living .
should we take the kids in ?
not yet . i don &apos;t want to spook oswald .
we wait .
you guys should invest in some of those little ,
christmas @-@ tree air fresheners .
you don &apos;t like the van . noted .
peter .
peter , can i talk to you ?
we took russell back to the bureau .
he didn &apos;t call his lawyer .
who &apos;d he call ?
play it .
neal .
neal . what ? i didn &apos;t do anything .
explain this . play it .
i &apos;m not working with the fbi !
they got me with the case . what was i supposed to do ?
tell &apos; em i can still get &apos; em alex hunter ,
but they got to post bail !
why is russell talking about alex hunter ?
do you know who he &apos;s talking to ?
went to a burner phone .
answer my question .
alex is in trouble .
alex is back ? damn it , neal .
i can &apos;t let my guard down for one day , can i ?
you used us to take russell out of play .
if you jeopardized this case ...
i didn &apos;t , peter .
diana ? it &apos;s 8 : 00 .
i don &apos;t think oswald &apos;s gonna show .
yeah , i guess he conned all of us .
check the locker .
why ?
check it .
the case isn &apos;t here .
damn it !
did we ever lose visual on the locker ?
no .
then how &apos;d he get the bag ? !
he was here the entire time .
so help me , if this was part of your plan --
it wasn &apos;t .
oswald improved my con .
then you better figure out how to catch him .
oh , why is he here ? i asked for alex .
understandably , my client does not trust the fbi .
she has asked her lawyer to preside in her absence .
got a nice little practice going ?
i do all right .
helps when you &apos;re friends with criminals .
thanks to you two , i got a pound of shrapnel in my ass
from today &apos;s misfire .
tell me why you really put us onto russell .
and it better be good .
someone &apos;s looking for alex .
russell said he could deliver her ,
and we took him out of play before he could .
who &apos;s looking for her ?
probably the same people who killed kate .
if oswald has the coins , he &apos;ll try and fence them eventually .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m counting on .
and you &apos;re gonna help make that happen .
we &apos;re gonna make oswald reveal
the krugerrands and the painting .
well ... how ?
those coins belonged to someone
who probably wants them back , right ?
tell me who .
uh ... russell may or -- or may not be
an old connection from detroit ...
... of the don corleone persuasion .
the detroit mob ?
yeah .
all right , i &apos;m gonna have to convince oswald
i &apos;m in with them .
what if he recognizes you ?
he won &apos;t .
unlike you , the bureau makes
sure that my picture doesn &apos;t get in the paper .
he knows you . you -- i don &apos;t trust .
so ...
impossible .
he studies crime for a living .
you &apos;d need an expert on the detroit mob to pull that o--
i just found my expert .
hello ?
can i help you ?
you took something of mine .
is that so ?
tell him you &apos;re the peacemaker .
that &apos;s an old detroit player . do it .
i &apos;m the peacemaker .
well , i don &apos;t recall starting any wars .
i &apos;m sure , uh ...
this is a misunderstanding .
you stole my krugerrands , and i want them back .
k @-@ k @-@ kru-- kru--
listen , i don &apos;t have time for jokes .
okay .
when it &apos;s a matter of our missing money ,
i never joke .
i never joke .
this picture tells a story , professor .
i don &apos;t see myself in that story .
no , but you see the case . and now you &apos;ve got it .
tell him you &apos;ll cut off his hands if he doesn &apos;t pay up .
what ?
it &apos;s the detroit mob ,
not the girl scouts .
i wouldn &apos;t want anything to happen to your hands , professor .
i said cut off his hands !
quiet , moz .
all right , listen , listen , if you &apos;re the peacemaker ,
i &apos;m sure we can find some common ground .
the krugerrands were worth $ 2 million .
i want $ 3 million for my trouble .
well , well , that &apos;s simply not possible .
make it possible .
deliver it tomorrow .
or i &apos;ll start with your thumbs .
or i &apos;ll start with your thumbs .
i can get you $ 200,000 .
$ 200,000 ?
10 % .
no , no , no , no . 30 % is the going rate .
$ 600,000 . fine .
okay . i need that wired today .
okay ?
no prob .
how much can i get for this ?
original thayer . nice .
i &apos;ll give you half a mil .
where does it say &quot; dumb schmuck &quot; on my face ?
the painting &apos;s been sliced . take it or leave it .
listen , it &apos;s cut at the frame line .
re @-@ stretched , you &apos;re not gonna lose even an inch of canvas .
you won &apos;t have any trouble finding an enthusiastic buyer
in macao or singapore ,
and i think ... you know that .
ah , professor &apos;s done his homework .
yes .
okay . $ 2 million .
wired today .
got it .
i &apos;ll need your account and routing number .
testing me , were you ?
there you go .
it &apos;s a pleasure doing business , george .
i wish i could say that --
fbi ! don &apos;t move ! hands on the table !
hands on the table !
george oswald , you &apos;re under arrest .
no .
no .
good to see you again , professor .
careful with his hands .
i want to see my lawyer .
come on , get moving .
thank you , miss hunter .
and i believe you &apos;ve been looking for this .
uh , per neal &apos;s suggestion ,
we &apos;ve booked you on a secure flight to italy .
and we made sure we publicly thanked russell
for his thoughtful and continued cooperation with the fbi .
neal said you were the best .
hello , everyone .
your professor , george oswald , will not be joining you today .
instead , i &apos;m here as a recruiter --
for the fbi .
hi , i &apos;m special agent peter burke .
and these are some of my colleagues .
they studied criminology just like you ,
and now they get to catch bad guys for a living .
fbi . you &apos;re under arrest .
guys , s @-@ stay calm .
professor oswald ! he made us do it !
good job , manny ! way to stay calm !
veronica , let me handle this .
no , listen to me . no , no , no , no , no .
listen , you don &apos;t understand . you don &apos;t understand .
if you think it &apos;s fun reading about these guys ,
wait until you experience the feeling of catching them .
wow .
for the record , i still maintain that i basically turned myself in .
the full weight of the fbi was bearing down on you .
i wear a badge .
he wears a tracking anklet .
applications are on the table .
you think we don &apos;t know how this works ? we know how this works !
manny !
shut your mouth !
i got this !
manny !
there &apos;s a lot of information
that we have for you .
manny , shut the hell up !
d.a. &apos; s dream . tripping over themselves to cut a deal .
they &apos;re young . we &apos;ll probably give it to &apos; em .
look at us .
saving america &apos;s youth from a life of crime .
ah , we &apos;re a regular after @-@ school special .
one second .
diana ...
boss , you have some time ? i have something to show you .
at first i thought one of the chips broken up .
but take a look .
narrow tunnel with a slight ridge .
there &apos;s something there .
leaving so soon ?
venice is calling .
mm . oh , y @-@ you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna actually keep that up here with me .
okay , sure .
you know , it &apos;s interesting .
they searched oswald &apos;s house
and found several of the things he was suspected of stealing --
jewelry , egyptian artifacts .
but there was a matisse ...
matisse ? mm . hmm .
it was rumored oswald had it , but it wasn &apos;t at his house .
that &apos;s shame . it &apos;d be worth a fortune .
yes , it would . it &apos;s about the size of your box there .
i &apos;ll keep an eye out .
i could use the reward money .
i &apos;m sure you could .
goodbye , neal .
alex .
be careful .
you too .
if someone &apos;s looking for me ...
they &apos;re coming after me , too .
that &apos;s the last piece of the music box .
i &apos;m giving up my obsession .
you &apos;re suggesting i give up mine ?
kate &apos;s gone .
the rest of us are still here .
goodbye , alex .
whatever this thing &apos;s hiding , it &apos;s not the music .
i think it &apos;s a keyhole .
a key to what ?
could we get it into x @-@ ray ?
not without alerting somebody .
i don &apos;t want to take a hammer to it just yet .
mm . it could self @-@ destruct .
wouldn &apos;t surprise me .
let &apos;s see if we can find that missing piece .
maybe our friend knows where it is .
