hey .
hey . so , what do you think ?
new haircut ? necklace ? dress ?
boots ? boots !
now , they &apos;re a little more than i usually spend on boots . or rent .
did you say you bought &quot; boots &quot; or &quot; boats &quot; ?
i know .
i &apos;ll miss being able to afford food .
i &apos;m sorry . they just looked so good .
the saleswoman was like :
&quot; these are too expensive for you . &quot;
she had a point .
hey .
hi . oh , my god .
oh , monica , those boots are amazing .
they &apos;re mine !
too bad we &apos;re gonna have to return them .
return them ? they &apos;re gonna hear you .
i &apos;m not returning them . i know they cost a lot , but i &apos;ll wear them all the time .
you &apos;ll see . besides , i love the compliments .
have you ever had something so beautiful , everyone wants it ?
i have you .
nice try . i &apos;m keeping the boots .
the.one.with.monicas.boots
that &apos;s right . i love you .
and i &apos;m gonna play with you all the time .
how can you let him talk to your crotch like that ?
he &apos;s talking to the baby .
oh ! okay .
okay , because when he said , &quot; l can &apos;t wait for your first words .. &quot;
i thought , &quot; there &apos;s a trick . &quot;
well , i gotta go , you guys . i &apos;ll see you later .
okay . bye .
bye .
hey , listen . can you do me a favor ? my sister knows you work at ralph lauren ..
forget it . no way . i am not sending more ralph lauren clothes to prison .
it is a waste .
no , not her .
my youngest sister , dina , is interested in fashion .
she wants to talk to someone successful to give her some advice .
i guess i could talk to my supervisors .
no , she wants to talk to you .
really ? oh , my god . i &apos;m successful .
okay , so would you meet with her ?
yes , i &apos;d love to . have her come by .
great , thanks . you &apos;ll love her . she &apos;s the smartest of all the tribbiani children .
yeah , you know the sats ?
yeah .
she took them .
doesn &apos;t ben go to smithfield day school ?
yeah . why ?
sting has a son that goes there too .
i know . he &apos;s in ben &apos;s class .
you knew and never said anything ? with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us ?
fine , no more dinosaur stuff . can i talk about fossils ?
&quot; sting &apos;s son , 7 years old . &quot; and there &apos;s a picture .
what are you reading , &quot; the kidnapper &apos;s guide to manhattan private schools &quot; ?
it &apos;s new york magazine . it &apos;s an article about the city &apos;s best schools .
so how well do you know sting ?
i actually haven &apos;t even met him .
yeah . that &apos;s too bad . i really wanna go to his concert friday , but it &apos;s sold out .
i know ! why don &apos;t you meet him and get tickets .
if you get two , i &apos;ll take you .
i &apos;m picking ben up tomorrow . maybe he &apos;ll be there .
there you go . you &apos;re so lucky . you might get to meet sting tomorrow .
that &apos;s why you have kids .
hey , guys .
hey .
hi , monica . hi , boots .
see , chandler ? i &apos;m getting a lot of use out of them already . they &apos;re very practical .
you can wear them with dresses , skirts , pants ..
you wear them with shorts on the corner and earn the money to pay for them .
wow , they &apos;re beautiful .
they hurt so much .
what ?
the guy who made these ..
hates feet and wants to see them die .
give them to me . i haven &apos;t felt my feet in years .
i can &apos;t . i told chandler i &apos;d wear them all the time . i can &apos;t just give them away .
then get your money back and return them .
i can &apos;t do that either .
the soles are scuffed up , and the insides are filled with my blood .
hey .
hey , i just picked up ben from school .
i don &apos;t think you did a very thorough job .
i dropped him off at carol &apos;s .
anyway , it turns out i &apos;m not gonna get those tickets , though .
oh , no . why not ?
it turns out ben and sting &apos;s son do not get along .
how come ?
apparently , sting &apos;s son made fun ..
of the fact that ben &apos;s moms are &quot; lesbenims . &quot;
wait . if they don &apos;t get along , smooth things over . make them be friends .
you can &apos;t force kids to be friends .
sure you can .
give them some blocks . put them in a playpen .
playpen ? ben &apos;s 7 .
your kid is 7 ?
he &apos;s really small .
please get the tickets .
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t do it .
yes , you can . sting says so himself .
what ?
rosssss can
look , i &apos;m sorry ..
rosssss can
phoebe ? ross can give me the tickets
ross can give me the tickets
here she is : future fashion superstar .
oh , joey , i &apos;m hardly ..
my little sister dina .
hi , dina . nice to meet you .
hi .
thanks so much for meeting with me . joey &apos;s told me so much about you .
this is so exciting for her .
ralph lauren smiled at her in the elevator .
you sure it was at you ?
because he likes it sometimes when the buttons light up .
well , i &apos;ll let you two &quot; fashists &quot; get down to business .
you , be good , learn a lot . and if she takes you to the freebie room , i need shirts ..
but none with that creepy logo with the guy riding the dog , holding the bone .
okay . all right , dina .
well , let &apos;s talk about the different areas of fashion ..
that you could get involved in .
let &apos;s see , there &apos;s design . but you may need a whole other degree for that .
sales is great . you get to travel .
i don &apos;t care about fashion .
i &apos;m pregnant . and i know you are too , so you gotta help me .
then there &apos;s marketing .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i just was yawning .
don &apos;t forget , my office party &apos;s tonight .
that &apos;s tonight ?
i forgot all about the &quot; secret santa &quot; gift .
do we like this ?
we don &apos;t really have to go to this thing , do we ?
i know that you don &apos;t like my office parties , but you can wear your new boots .
see ? every cloud has a supple leather lining .
i don &apos;t wanna wear the boots tonight .
why not ?
i &apos;m worried your bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money .
or your assistant will see them and want a raise .
do you think i work some kind of boot @-@ pricing company ?
i picked out this outfit i wanna wear , and the boots don &apos;t go with it .
you said those boots go with skirts , dresses and pants .
what are you planning on wearing , a chicken suit ?
fine . if you want me to , i &apos;ll wear the boots .
in fact , i &apos;ll go into my room right now and try the outfit on .
christmas party in my boots !
i can &apos;t go in there . i can &apos;t tell him .
it &apos;s gonna be okay . he has been incredibly supportive of me .
and if he gets a little upset , that &apos;s what the meatball sub is for .
thank you .
okay .
hey ! it &apos;s my fashion girls .
what &apos;s wrong ?
why don &apos;t you sit down .
dina has something that she wants to tell you .
what &apos;s going on ? is it mom ? is she sick ?
is it dad &apos;s heart ?
is that a sandwich ?
mom and dad are fine .
is that a sandwich ? !
joey , there &apos;s something that you should know . dina ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
what ?
now . give him the sandwich !
obviously , this is a mistake . you can &apos;t be pregnant .
because you have to have sex to get pregnant .
joe , i tried to wait until i was 25 , like you did .
what ? dina ..
i can &apos;t believe this . you &apos;re the good one . you went to college ! both years !
who did this to you ?
bobby corso . but he &apos;s a real nice guy . i like him a lot . he &apos;s real funny .
you got pregnant for &quot; funny &quot; ? dina , if he &apos;s funny , laugh !
i &apos;ll be back . stay here !
why ? where you going ?
i can &apos;t look at you right now .
i know .
oh , there you are , ben .
you &apos;re ben , right ?
aunt phoebe , what are you doing here ?
i heard you &apos;re having a problem with one of the boys .
so i thought i &apos;d come and sit you both down , have a little talk and make it all okay .
now , the boy &apos;s name is sting &apos;s son .
jack ? i hate him . he &apos;s a jerk .
sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside ..
but they have famous fathers .
i have to go . my friend doug is waiting for me over there .
wow , your friend doug looks a lot like billy joel .
is that who his father is ?
no . his dad &apos;s a dentist .
him , you &apos;re friends with .
excuse me , can i help you with something ?
yes . i &apos;m looking for jack &apos;s parents .
are you with one of the students ?
i &apos;m with ben .
are you one of ben &apos;s mothers ?
i am one of ben &apos;s mothers .
i &apos;m a lesbian .
it was difficult coming out to my parents .
well , hi . i &apos;m jenny boon . i &apos;m a new teacher here .
i &apos;ve only met your partner , carol .
that would make me susan .
right . are you looking for jack &apos;s parents to discuss his problems with ben ?
i think the parents should sit down together and have a conversation .
yeah , let &apos;s do that !
that sounds good .
we should sit down and talk . me , my lover , carol , and the stings .
how will i get in touch with them ?
their number &apos;s on the contact sheet .
could i get a copy of that ? carol threw it out . she lost ours .
she &apos;s such a scatterbrain . but , man , what a hot piece of ass .
you know , that party wasn &apos;t bad .
yeah . i didn &apos;t know there &apos;d be dancing .
that was a fun surprise .
i don &apos;t see a cab . maybe we should walk .
no , we can &apos;t walk .
no . hey , there &apos;s a cab .
that &apos;s a police car .
maybe we could commit a crime , have them pick us up .
it &apos;s 15 blocks to the subway . come on .
okay .
do you think we can get to the subway if we climb through that manhole ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t walk , okay ?
these boots were a huge mistake .
what ?
you were right . i never should have bought them . they &apos;re killing me , one toe at a time .
so they &apos;re really tight , huh ?
i just said you were right , sweetie .
isn &apos;t it clear i &apos;m delirious from the pain ?
so i was right . this is what it feels like to be right .
it &apos;s oddly unsettling .
how are we gonna we get home ? maybe a piggyback ride ?
i don &apos;t think me getting on your back is gonna improve matters .
wow , being right sure doesn &apos;t help with the funny .
hop on .
okay , wait .
let me just get my boots off first .
oh , god .
i know you &apos;re in pain right now , but i &apos;m a little turned @-@ on .
do you ever worry that you &apos;ll be walking and your baby will just slip out ?
what college was that , dina ?
oh , my god . bobby ?
hi , dina . good to see you .
joey , what are you doing ?
just what needs to be done .
dearly beloved , we &apos;re gathered here ..
this is crazy .
don &apos;t interrupt me when i &apos;m talking to god !
where were we ? do you take this man .. ?
no !
you &apos;ll take him .
no , i won &apos;t !
you don &apos;t get a say .
yes , i do .
i heard &quot; l do . &quot; we &apos;re halfway there . you .
all right , joey , that is enough !
as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is , this is not legal .
they don &apos;t have a marriage license or witnesses , and the groom only has one shoe .
yeah , he took the other one off and hit me with it .
what am i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to realize they are adults and that can make their own decisions .
no , they can &apos;t . they were stupid enough to get knocked up !
contraceptives are not always effective . right ?
yeah . we kind of didn &apos;t use any .
come on , kids , a little help here !
wow ! this place is incredible !
sting &apos;s pen ..
that he gave to phoebe .
come on , secret passageway .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m trudie . you must be ben &apos;s mum .
why else would i be here ?
why don &apos;t you sit down .
i gather jack and ben haven &apos;t been getting along lately .
i &apos;m sure there are two sides to this story .
but all i &apos;ve heard is that ben &apos;s a bit of a &quot; poo @-@ poo @-@ head . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , won &apos;t jack &apos;s father be joining us ?
no .
i see . you see , i think it would be better for the children ..
if all the parents were here . except for , you know , ben &apos;s birth mother and father .
well , i &apos;m sorry . jack &apos;s father &apos;s not available .
okay . well , then , could we reschedule for friday night , perhaps at 8 : 00 ?
no , i know that wouldn &apos;t work . my husband &apos;s in concert .
concert . yeah . that does put us in quite a pickle .
i &apos;m busy before and after the concert , and he &apos;s obviously busy during .
so i guess you and i should talk about jack and ben right now .
unless .. unless ..
okay , i would be willing to go to the concert ..
all the while thinking about the children .
are you here for tickets ?
thank you . four would be great .
i &apos;m not giving concert tickets to someone who &apos;d use their son like this .
then you &apos;re in luck . ben &apos;s not my son .
look , i &apos;ve just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm .
any minute now , the police will be here .
the police ? here ?
a reunion ?
okay , 10 blocks down . five to go .
oh , wait ! stop , stop !
oh , i &apos;m sorry . do you need a break ?
my boots in tan ! can you get a little closer so i see the price ?
i can see it from right here . it &apos;ll cost you one husband .
i &apos;m sorry . i can walk the rest of the way now . just give me my boots .
i don &apos;t have your boots .
i don &apos;t have them either . where are they ?
why don &apos;t you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay ?
okay . my god , we gotta go back and get them !
are you ever gonna wear the boots again ?
yes , i am . okay ? they &apos;re very practical .
i could wear them with pants or skirts ..
honey . honey .
okay , i &apos;ll never wear them again . i just didn &apos;t get a chance to say goodbye .
you know what ? you can say goodbye to the tan ones .
okay . all right .
okay .
bye , boots . wait ! half off !
just because they &apos;re not getting married doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a disaster .
maybe they have a plan .
oh , okay , let &apos;s hear their plan .
now , what &apos;s the future look like for dina and bobby ?
well ..
i really have high hopes for my band .
you were right . he is funny .
now , wait a minute .
i bet when you told people you wanted to be an actor , they laughed at you .
come on , bobby , tell us a little bit about your band .
well , it &apos;s just me and my pal rooster . the band &apos;s name is numbnuts .
really ?
if you &apos;re having a baby , you should be married .
even if it is to bobby . dude , that &apos;s not a compliment .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t be supportive .
so , what are you gonna do ?
have the baby and raise it by yourself ? without a husband ?
you can &apos;t be a single mother alone ! you &apos;re gonna ruin your life !
excuse me . am i ruining my life ?
no , it &apos;s different for you .
you &apos;re so strong . you &apos;re not some dumb kid who doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s doing .
excuse me ?
one pregnant woman at a time , please !
i just want you to be okay .
so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen ?
maybe .
yeah . so , what kind of music does numbnuts .. ?
oh , forget it ! i can &apos;t !
i am scared to death about this . but i think i can do it . i just need some help .
bobby &apos;s gonna be here the whole time .
you bet i am .
and to answer your earlier question , we &apos;re straight @-@ up gangster rap .
look , rachel &apos;s told me how much easier you &apos;ve made all this on her .
why can &apos;t you do that for me ?
because you &apos;re my baby sister !
and you &apos;re my big brother . you &apos;re my favorite guy in the whole world .
i &apos;m not even scared to tell mom and dad . i was scared of telling you .
i &apos;d be scared of them , but all right .
i can &apos;t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me .
i want him to have his uncle .
is my baby gonna have his uncle joey ?
of course he &apos;s gonna have his uncle joey .
we &apos;ll be all right . even if we &apos;re not married , this baby will be so loved .
and not just by us .
that &apos;s right .
by his uncle too .
and by you .
bobby , why don &apos;t we come over here and let them have a little moment , okay ?
come here .
no , seriously , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
guess what .
we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good . we know each other .
so ..
anyway , guess what .
oh , there &apos;s more ?
you &apos;re gonna love me so much . i got sting tickets !
oh , my god , i do love you ! how did you do it ?
well , let &apos;s just say :
ross can
where are the seats ?
middle balcony .
would you say that &apos;s more than 50 yards away ..
from sting , his wife or a member of his family ?
