oh , my god ! we have customers ?
what &apos;s going on ?
why are there so many hipsters here ?
are we selling stupid hats and telling them
they &apos;re more talented than they actually are ?
no , that &apos;s already a store . it &apos;s called &quot; fedorable . &quot;
you &apos;ve been working so hard to get us customers in ,
i wanted to contribute by finding a way
to get in the neighborhood hipsters .
so ... here &apos;s our new flyer .
you made up a new flyer without talking to me about it first ?
i renamed all the cupcakes after people from the &apos; 90s !
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
we &apos;ve got all your flavor flavs . &quot;
hipsters love &apos; 90s nostalgia more than they love
pretending not to love anything .
&quot; come in and lick a beavis .
eat a butt @-@ head . &quot;
the pistachio is now called the dennis rodman
because it &apos;s such a dumbass flavor .
cute .
wait , what &apos;s going on over there ?
why are all those cupcakes smashed ?
those are the nancy kerrigans .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s in good taste
to make fun of her personal tragedy .
i sold eight of them .
screw her , you &apos;re a genius !
ooh , ooh , can i name one ?
how &apos; bout we call the day @-@ olds the hugh hefners ?
that &apos;s not &apos; 90s .
he &apos;s in his 90s , and he &apos;s stale and hard .
can i get a jonathan taylor thomas to go
and two of the spice girls ?

any one but &quot; baby . &quot;
sure .
dude , you should come to the &apos; 90s trivia contest
every monday at the bar bar .
you could win , like , big money .
yeah , and then i could pay for the lobotomy i &apos;d need
to forget that i ever participated
in a hipster contest in a bar .
cute hat . you &apos;re very talented .
i &apos;m putting this flyer up in the window .
oh , look , there &apos;s a street performer trying to get people
to dance with his marionette outside our shop .
uh @-@ oh , not cool !
no hipster wants to krump with a puppet .
see , he just chased them away .
we &apos;ll just ask him to move , but we have to be nice .
nice ? nice ...
oh , yeah , that &apos;s the thing you are to the welfare lady
while your mom &apos;s in the bedroom hiding the new tv .
hi , how are you ? we own this cupcake--
shh ! not while he &apos;s dancing .
i &apos;m sorry , would you like me to wait ?
oh , this dude &apos;s a serial killer .
do you want me to ...
yup , total serial killer .
just a matter of time till we &apos;re hung on strings
in his basement .
and i probably just got puppet herpes .
well , i hope you enjoyed your kiss
with charming pierre .
now , if you wouldn &apos;t mind ...
oh , pierre &apos;s a prostitute ?
it &apos;s a little weird for him to do it out in the open ,
but if he can &apos;t afford a car , he can &apos;t afford a car .
oh , you &apos;re one of those @-@ a woman without wonder .
not true . in fact , i &apos;m wondering
how you manage to pay rent .
okay , could you two just move along ?
i have another show in five minutes .
that was a show ?
look , you can &apos;t do your little skits here .
she doesn &apos;t mean to be negative .
she &apos;s right . i was planning to be all positive
till your doll raped her leg .
pierre is not a doll , okay ?
he is a marionette . hand @-@ carved by me .
and i don &apos;t do &quot; skits , &quot; okay ?
i received a national endowment for my work .
what ? the government pays for stuff like this ,
and i can &apos;t get my back tooth fixed ?
well , i , for one , really appreciate
the art of puppetry .
i can tell you do , and ...
so can pierre .
you know , he doesn &apos;t just approach anybody .
i &apos;m caroline . this is max . and you are ?
my stage name is j. petto .
oh , so cute . geppetto , like pinocchio &apos;s father .
no , it &apos;s &quot; j , &quot; period , &quot; petto . &quot;
disney owns the rights to the name geppetto ,
so once again , the poor , starving artist gets screwed !
so sad . can you move ?
see , this is our cupcake shop ,
and you &apos;re blocking the entrance .
uh , this is a public space ,
and i know my rights .
showtime !
i was trying to be nice ,
but you are the rudest puppeteer i &apos;ve ever met .
and i &apos;m including shari lewis ,
who told my father to shove it on my fifth birthday !
let &apos;s go , max .
hey ... doll man .
you don &apos;t want to mess with us .
i make one call to the cops ,
they do a background check , and i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;d go
from &quot; j. petto &quot; to &quot; j. petto @-@ phile . &quot;
miss , i dropped my david hasselhoff .
well , it &apos;s not the first time he &apos;s been on the floor .
hey , you can &apos;t talk to me like that .
i studied puppetry in paris at the palais--
oh , my god , he slipped on david hasselhoff !
are you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just a little embarrassed .
oh , no , no . i landed on pierre !
pierre ?
here , have a seat .
would either of you like a coffee or a free cupcake ?
no , i &apos;m just gonna pack up and go . thank you .
come back anytime for a free cupcake .
but no need to bring your dolls .
they &apos;re not dolls ! i &apos;m a man !
it &apos;s crazy how many hipsters
came into our shop today from our new flyers .
we ran completely out of all
the butterfinger buttafuocos ,
the joeys , and even the mary jos ,
which i did not think would sell .
i reworked the smashed nancy kerrigans
and called it the mary jo .
girls , i &apos;m so happy for you .
you know , i remember when my business
first started to take off .
the first thing i did was to buy the little village
that i grew up in
and then burn it to the ground !
i was just so angry
they wouldn &apos;t let me be a cheerleader .
no , baby , that was the movie carrie .
you fell asleep watching it last night .
oh . yeah , i gotta stop watching movies late at night .
once , for a whole year ,
i thought i framed roger rabbit .
i &apos;m looking for the owners of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
oh , that &apos;s me . wow , word is really spreading .
how can i help you ?
you &apos;ve been served .
max , i just got served .
did he go after your bangs ? &apos; cause that &apos;s where i &apos;d start .
this is a lawsuit .
it says , &quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes is being sued
for injuries sustained in our shop by myron shales ,
a.k.a. &apos; j. petto . &apos; &quot;
max , it &apos;s the puppet guy .
he &apos;s suing us ?
we should be suing him for gross ...
i don &apos;t know what the legal words are
but just for being gross .
we can &apos;t afford to be sued .
we can &apos;t even afford the lawyer on those bus ads
who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other .
i hope everything was satisfactory .
can i get you ladies anything else ...
like a strong work ethic ?
han , it &apos;s not funny . we &apos;re being sued .
okay , let me see those .
i studied law in korea ,
but i never made it through graduation .
i realized it wasn &apos;t my passion ,
and i pulled out .
did they know it was in ?
let &apos;s see ...
yeah , you &apos;re being sued .
what law school did you go to , cal state @-@ the @-@ obvious ?
did you graduate magna come rarely ?
i told you , i pulled out .
but don &apos;t worry , accidents like this happen
in stores all the time .
that &apos;s why all businesses have insurance .
well , not all businesses .
how could you not have insurance ?
you need to get protection .
and i &apos;m not talking about condoms .
we &apos;re not idiots , han .
we had the insurance discussion .
i was like , &quot; max , we need insurance . &quot;
and she was like , &quot; do we have any money ? &quot;
and i was like , &quot; no . &quot; and she was like ,
&quot; what are the chances something will happen ? &quot;
and i was like , &quot; a million to one . &quot;
and she was like , &quot; i like those odds .
let &apos;s go get gummi bears . &quot; and i was like , &quot; okay .
but we &apos;ll talk about this at another time . &quot;
and here we are talking about it now .
remember , we have no choice .
we have to get him to drop this lawsuit .
okay , 3b , here . this is the puppet guy &apos;s apartment .
you say puppet guy , i say serial killer .
you say apartment , i say the brightest dot
on the &quot; megan &apos;s law &quot; website .
max , that is not charming . stay on message .
we &apos;re charming , we &apos;re sorry ...
we &apos;re drunk .
well , i am .
how else do you think i &apos;m gonna pull off charming ?
let &apos;s just get in and out of there .
that puppet creeped me out .
i don &apos;t want to have to see it again .
oh , i am not drunk enough for this .
i &apos;ve never been drunk enough for this .
is j. petto home ?
i &apos;m kind of surprised .
i did not think he &apos;d have a girlfriend .
hello .
well , i hope you enjoyed meeting yvette .
she plays the lute , you know .
oh , yes , she was very charming .
and small . she must make your penis look huge .
i &apos;m sorry ?
charming , max , charming .
hi , we just stopped by to bring you some cupcakes .
we feel so bad about what happened .
can we come in for a minute ?
um , well , i wasn &apos;t expecting company ,
but come in .
we &apos;re all just hangin &apos; out .
oh , oh , this isn &apos;t weird . this isn &apos;t weird at all .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re in a dead body car wash .
i had a nightmare that i had a nightmare like this once .
just so you know ,
i &apos;m not allowed to talk about the lawsuit .
well , i &apos;m not allowed to talk
about how i really feel right now .
speaking of the lawsuit , you seem well--
you know , physically @-@ which is great ,
because the suit said you had a shattered arm
and a broken hip .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m not suing you
for my shattered arm and hip .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s for pierre &apos;s .
i crushed his little body when i fell .
he must have thrown himself under my body
to protect my fall .
dexter , party of one .
i have to rotate his arm and hold it every 15 minutes
to get his full range of motion back .
that &apos;s what the sling &apos;s about . i know he &apos;s not alive .
do you ?
we &apos;re very sorry for his injury ,
but this is absurd .
you can &apos;t sue us because your puppet broke .
yes , i can . this puppet is my livelihood ,
and he &apos;s heavily insured .
great , the puppet has insurance , and we don &apos;t .
max !
what ?
you don &apos;t have insurance ?
you have a business but no insurance ?
look , we can &apos;t go to court . it would wreck us .
can we leave the lawyers out of this
and come up with a more creative solution ?
i mean , you &apos;re clearly creative .
look , you even made a skeleton king .
that &apos;s not a skeleton king .
that &apos;s pazuzu , prince of darkness .
let me just put this out there
because we should really move things along ,
and also , i &apos;m afraid .
how much is it gonna take to make this go away ?
do you want to take a second to consult
with one of your roommates ?
i think i saw a lawyer doll .
he is not a lawyer . he is a maitre d &apos; .
and a damn good one !
you women just don &apos;t get it .
this is why i broke up with
my toronto @-@ based girlfriend over skype .
right ?
$ 1,000 by monday .
but if she makes another comment about my intricate ,
hand @-@ carved marionettes being dolls ...
it goes up .
fine , $ 1,000 and no strings .
except for the ones on all
max , don &apos;t say it !
valley of the dolls , return to the valley of the dolls ,
chucky , bride of chucky , hello dolly , dollywood ,
and the dalai lama !
those are the things i was holding in .
oh , wait @-@ doll and oates !
now what ?
how are we gonna get 1,000 extra dollars by monday ?
wait , max , we can go to that bar
and exploit your special gifts .
if i have to strip , i have to strip .
not that kind of bar , the hipster trivia bar .
can &apos;t i just strip ? at least i &apos;d still have my dignity .
it &apos;s all here . $ 1,000 .
so that &apos;s it . no more lawsuit .
actually , that &apos;s not it .
as it turns out , we &apos;re gonna need 500 more .
for what ? did your dues for the serial killer &apos;s union
and the pedophile guild come up at the same time this year ?
pierre &apos;s in crisis !
but his psychiatrist could tell you more about that .
if there &apos;s a psychiatrist in this apartment
who hasn &apos;t locked him up , i don &apos;t trust his opinion .
i &apos;m dr. pangloss .
pierre broke more than his hip in your cupcake shop .
he broke his spirit .
he lost his dream !
he no longer wants to perform .
this is where he cuts us in half
and sews my top to your bottom .
on the plus side , we &apos;d look amazing .
yeah , well , you heard it .
pierre &apos;s ready to give up his art ,
and he needs a little more money .
forget it , puppet nuts . we don &apos;t have $ 500 .
we don &apos;t have 500 anything .
well , think about it .
that &apos;s my tea kettle . yvette !
uhh ! i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;m not so sure the hostility is quite working ,
so why don &apos;t you go wait in the hall ?
and i &apos;ll try to talk some sense into him alone .
you are the only person in the world
who would insist on being alone with this man ,
but okay .
please just listen . we are broke .
to get any more money , we &apos;d have to strip .
well , gigi and lana started off as strippers ,
and now they &apos;re in the folies bergere , so ...
you know , even for a middle @-@ aged puppeteer ,
you &apos;re a freak .
see you in court !
nothing . he &apos;s gonna sue us ,
and we have no other tricks up our sleeve .
well , maybe not my sleeve , but how about my coat ?
pierre ?
right there .
i &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re not open today .
i know you took him . give me back pierre !
we &apos;re not open .
we &apos;ve had a terrible tragedy .
well , not us , but a new friend of ours
had a gruesome accident , and we are just devastated .
you wouldn &apos;t be that cruel .
relax , i could never be that cruel .
but max could .
look who it is , pierre , your lover , j. petto !
he &apos;s not gay .
he had a girlfriend named lulu .
she was a--she was a courtesan in the court of a french king .
they broke up over a brief flirtation she had with yvette .
and i know they &apos;re not alive !
now , what do you say we stick to the original no @-@ strings deal ?
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t , max will show you
what &quot; no strings &quot; really means .
do it ! go ! bring it !
i can always re @-@ string him . i &apos;m a master of my craft .
yes , we thought you &apos;d say that .
so you leave us no choice . max ...
what ? i--
i &apos;m not changing my mind .
and i &apos;m coming back with the police .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t get the cops involved ...
now that your boy here is in a ...
compromising situation !
how dare you !
and she does not like the feel of a condom !
you two are sick !
hey , we don &apos;t judge .
we think whatever two consenting dolls ,
or maybe three consenting dolls do--
and it &apos;s gonna be bad
&apos;cause he &apos;s a grower , not a shower .
and once a few of these pics are posted online ,
there goes your children &apos;s party business .
now , call it quits , and you can delete these pics .
fine . yes . okay , you win . you win . you win .
oh , we &apos;re not falling for your word again .
if you want your doll back--
for the last time , he is not a doll !
bring us a notarized letter saying
you release max &apos;s homemade cupcakes
of all further legal action ,
and we &apos;ll give you back pierre , perfectly intact .
minus his virginity , of course .
but don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll still have yours .
okay , i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
ugh , 30 years in the cutthroat world of puppets ,
and i &apos;m undone by two crazy cupcake bitches !
did you hear that ? 30 years ?
30 years of following his dream , and he &apos;s still broke ?
is that gonna be us , max ?
is our dream just as stupid as puppets ?
sorry , pierre , i forgot you were here .
he &apos;s sound asleep .
three @-@ ways really take it out of you .
here , dress her . she has to get a cab .
she &apos;d rather sleep in her own bed .
and do you know why we &apos;re not gonna turn into him ?
because 30 years ago , when j. petto said ,
&quot; i &apos;m gonna be a puppeteer , &quot;
he didn &apos;t have a best friend to tell him ,
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t do that . it &apos;s a stupid idea . &quot;
and unlike him , you have me to tell you
when it &apos;s a stupid idea .
and i have you to tell me not to mace myself ,
no matter how bad i want to know how it feels .
so the cupcake shop isn &apos;t a stupid idea ?
no . and it &apos;s actually starting to take off .
&apos;cause no one embraces a stupid idea like a hipster .
but , max , we do need insurance .
but do we have the money ?
no .
what are the chances someone else is gonna fall ?
a million to one .
i like those odds .
you know , this is a really cute dress .
forget the dress .
look at his cute pants .
we really should give them to han .
