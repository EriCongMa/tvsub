i don &apos;t know anyone that has ever made
a long @-@ distance relationship work .
but i can &apos;t stand that i put you in this position ,
and the only way i can see out of this
is for you to go to stanford .
come after me , tanner .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re here for .
you actually care about her .
you think he didn &apos;t say some things in there
that got to me too ?
well , i &apos;m not bringing them up , because right now ,
we need to stick together .
sticking together means telling the truth .
i can &apos;t stand to see them come after you .
you think i can &apos;t take it !
look , you &apos;re not listening to me , okay ?
i can &apos;t take it !
if all you want to do is work with me ,
i can find a job somewhere else .
scottie , that &apos;s not all i want .
then say it .
i want you in my life .
i don &apos;t want her to go ,
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
i finished my list .
and ?
you &apos;re staying ?
just try and stop me .
this place has every harvard law student file ever .
do not touch any of the files in here .
mike ross ? he &apos;s not here .
what are you thinking about ?
you look beautiful .
thank you .
what are you thinking ?
that your furniture &apos;s really old .
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; antiquey . &quot;
that is not a word ,
and this sofa is ikea circa 1994 .
okay , i get it .
so you get up early just so you can do a thorough critiquing
of my furniture ?
actually , i got up early , so i could figure out
if there &apos;s anything around here that i could stand living with .
as--i &apos;m sorry--do you want to move in together ?
yeah , i mean , if the offer still stands .
are you kidding me ?
so is that a yes ?
oh , no , this is a yes .
i figured out what we can bring .
what ?
you .
panda , right here .
that &apos;s my favorite piece of art .
that is not art .
grammy gave that to me .
oh , i love it . panda can come .
and the chair .
that was grammy &apos;s favorite chair .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--
no , no , no , no , no , i &apos;m telling you , rachel ,
she used to sit in that chair every sunday
and drink her hot cup of hershey &apos;s cocoa
and tell me all about growing up
on the mean streets of philadelphia .
when you lie , try less details .
got it .
looking for me ?
no .
the woman i &apos;m looking for is a lot more in my bed .
what can i say ? my schedule stops for no man .
yes , but we &apos;ve got a little unfinished ...
business .
i wouldn &apos;t call last night &quot; unfinished . &quot;
and i wouldn &apos;t call it &quot; business . &quot;
i was talking about breakfast .
harvey specter makes breakfast ?
you never heard of the specter special ?
i think i just had the specter special .
oh , no , no , no , no .
the specter special is
let me guess .
it &apos;s two eggs , over easy ,
with a side of &quot; scottie ,
i want you in my life . &quot;
bacon .
and now i &apos;m reconsidering the &quot; in my life &quot; thing .
oh , no , i saw your face . you had your serious face on .
&quot; scottie , i want you in my life .
scottie ... i want you in my life . &quot;
you know what ? you don &apos;t deserve my bacon .
oh , that &apos;s fine , &apos; cause i have to go anyway .
where could you have to go ? you &apos;re unemployed .
well , actually a top @-@ tier law firm offered me a job last night ,
and i thought it might be best
if i negotiate the terms of my agreement
with the partner i &apos;m not sleeping with .
there &apos;s a slight problem with that plan .
you offered her a job before talking to me ?
i didn &apos;t offer her a job . i asked her if she wanted one .
i didn &apos;t want to waste your time , and for the record ,
we &apos;d be lucky to have her .
i know that .
but my question isn &apos;t why i should want her here ,
it &apos;s why you would want her here .
she &apos;s the best lawyer i know , after me .
and you .
are you sleeping with her ?
excuse me ?
you have history with this woman ,
so i just want to know
are you doing this because you feel sorry for her
or because you want to pay her back
or because you love her or what ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
it is my business .
it is literally my business .
i want a relationship with her .
well , i &apos;m happy for you .
i hope you two make a run at it .
thanks .
i &apos;ll pretend you meant that .
your track record isn &apos;t great .
you &apos;ve had three name partners in two years .
let &apos;s talk about your commitment issues .
i &apos;m not asking you to give my commitment issues a corner office .
you don &apos;t need to give her a corner office .
any regular office will do .
harvey , i get it .
she &apos;s a catch , for you and for this firm .
but what happens when you two break up ?
who says we &apos;re gonna break up ?
foreman versus heart med-- i want it .
&quot; good morning , harvey .
what can i do for you today ? &quot;
i &apos;m serious .
they &apos;re pushing for a settlement
because they know our client can afford it .
i know they are .
you haven &apos;t even looked at the file .
my name is on the door .
you think i don &apos;t know our cases ?
so why are we settling ?
because regardless of the merits of this case ,
it &apos;s not worth our time .
harvey , listen--
heart med &apos;s in @-@ house lawyer negotiated this
because the bad pr costs them more than the settlement .
we &apos;d have to get the thing dismissed to make it worth it ,
and that &apos;s not gonna happen .
the lawyer is nick rinaldi .
who the hell is nick rinaldi ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
i was 11 years old , a little boy , powerless .
i watched him boil my parents &apos; lives down to a few dollars .
yes .
i &apos;m not gonna let that piece of shit get a penny from us .
i said yes .
thanks , harvey .
you want to thank me ,
why don &apos;t you go beat the shit out of this guy ?
monday , 2 : 20 p.m.
this conundrum is burning a hole in my brain .
think .
logically .
i mean , sheila is professional and meticulous
and wonderfully anal ,
and if she says that nothing gets misplaced
in her inner sanctum , then i believe her ,
which leaves the national security option .
is mike ross cia ?
please .
there &apos;s a better chance that esther &apos;s in the kgb .
i mean , i can ask sheila ,
if i &apos;m no longer fond of my testicles , which--
wait a second , missing testicles , missing file .
it can &apos;t be missing if it doesn &apos;t exist .
holy shit .
what if mike ross never went to harvard at all ?
what if he just went to some crappy third @-@ tier law school ,
like fordham or arizona state ?
&quot; yeah , hey , bro .
&quot; yeah , no , i &apos;ll see you at the party .
&quot; i &apos;m not going to study for the bar .
&quot; damn straight , that &apos;s right , bros before hos .
oh , yeah , you know-- &quot; all right , that &apos;s enough .
he &apos;s been peeing directly into our pristine pool of eliteness .
he &apos;s been--oh , shoot , it &apos;s blinking out .
norma , really quickly ,
i need you to get a pack of rechargeable --
shit , it &apos;s out .
so i guess i &apos;m just talking to myself .
harvey convinced me , so let &apos;s get to it .
i want a relocation fee .
done .
and a 10 % increase on my signing bonus .
7 % .
you gave harvey 10 % .
do you think you &apos;re worth as much as harvey ?
i &apos;m less of a pain in the ass .
10 % it is .
now , no one ever opens with the big stuff ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re really after ?
you know what i &apos;m after .
the name of the firm is pearson specter .
it &apos;s changed too many times , and it &apos;s not going to change again .
never ?
i never say never .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m looking for .
of course .
after all , who knows where any of us will be in a few years ?
you , me , harvey .
i think we just changed the subject .
we did .
now it &apos;s time for me to tell you what i &apos;m really after .
you want to know how committed i am to harvey .
i want to know how committed you are to me .
how serious are you ?
about what ?
me .
we had this conversation .
we had this conversation
before it was going to cost me $ 500,000 .
jessica &apos;s making you pay the buy @-@ in up front ?
yep .
shit .
what did you say ?
well , i said i don &apos;t want to have to pay
a harvey @-@ specter @-@ girlfriend tax .
you &apos;re not exactly paying a tax .
you &apos;re just buying in early .
harvey , there &apos;s a reason that firms are designed to have
a six @-@ month trial period .
yeah , to see if it &apos;s going to work out .
exactly .
which you don &apos;t think it will .
i &apos;m saying that i need to know
what &quot; i want you in my life &quot; really means .
you know what it means .
it means i want to have a relationship .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m ready to give you a ring .
you think i &apos;m ready for a ring from you ?
then what are you ready for ?
i &apos;m ready for it not to cost me a $ 1 / 2 million
if it doesn &apos;t work out .
so if it doesn &apos;t , are you saying you &apos;re going to leave ?
would you want me to stay ?
i don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re gonna do to break us up .
harvey , i &apos;m not kidding . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m scared .
you know , i just got an offer
from latham &amp; watkins in chicago ,
and i don &apos;t want to take it , but ...
i need to know that you &apos;re serious about this .
scottie , i am .
yeah , but nobody &apos;s asking you to put up $ 1 / 2 million .
maybe we can make it
so nobody &apos;s asking you to do that either .
rinaldi .
you remember me ?
james and nina ross .
that &apos;s good .
finally know my parents &apos; names .
what you maybe don &apos;t know is that i &apos;m a lawyer ,
i work for pearson specter ,
and we &apos;re not going to be settling this foreman suit .
we had an agreement .
yeah , maybe , but instead ,
we &apos;re gonna be filing this .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re getting this case dismissed .
you know , i actually wanted to believe that whole sob story
about being reformed , but--
my client is a widow , not a drunk driver .
oh , so you don &apos;t actually bully the little guy anymore ,
you just try and capitalize on him .
do you even know the details of this case ,
or are you just coming after us because i &apos;m on the other side ?
no , i &apos;m coming after you
because you &apos;re a worthless ambulance chaser ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let you take my client &apos;s money .
this is the second time you &apos;ve come after me
from out of the blue .
i apologized to you once .
i will not apologize to you again .
you don &apos;t have to .
and we &apos;re not going to court ,
because i &apos;m gonna prove you &apos;re full of shit .
you ready for the deposition ?
yeah , of course i &apos;m ready .
your fly is unzipped .
no , it &apos;s not .
didn &apos;t even flinch .
that means you &apos;re ready .
then why are you still walking with me ?
cause i &apos;m coming to your deposition .
what ? whoa , whoa , hey , hey .
you said that i could take this case .
you told me i could kick this guy &apos;s ass .
it &apos;s my deposition , not yours .
i know .
you know ?
why are you babysitting me ?
i &apos;m not babysitting you .
i want to watch you kill this guy .
that &apos;s why i brought snacks .
you can &apos;t bring peanuts into my deposition .
why ?
it &apos;s unprofessional .
so is that tie , but i &apos;ve made my peace with it .
look , i don &apos;t give a shit
whether you made your peace with it or not .
you want in my room ?
you &apos;re not bringing peanuts .
you really are ready .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
harvey &apos;s interviews the day mike ross was hired .
but mike ross isn &apos;t on it .
where &apos;d you get this ?
doesn &apos;t matter where i got it . the fact is i did .
are you asking me why mike ross isn &apos;t on it ?
yeah , donna , that &apos;s precisely what i &apos;m asking .
how exactly did harvey find him ?
we didn &apos;t find him , he found us .
what are you talking about ?
mike hadn &apos;t signed up for the interview on time ,
so he pretended to be one of the other associates on the list .
he talked his way past me
and impressed the shit out of harvey ,
whose main requirement was somebody who had the balls
to do something like that in the first place .
okay .
what if he had the balls to do something
a lot bigger than that ?
what are you talking about ?
i think mike ross went to a subpar law school
and has been lying about it the whole time .
louis , listen to yourself .
you &apos;re talking about mike .
you &apos;re insane .
i &apos;m--
okay , i was in the harvard file room with sheila .
don &apos;t ask details .
and i noticed mike ross &apos; file was not there .
you specifically looked for his file ?
yes , and i looked for harvey &apos;s too ,
and his was there .
and by the way , he looked like a major douche .
so you looked at a grand total of two files
out of tens of thousands ,
and this is the conclusion you jump to ?
what is wrong with you ?
you don &apos;t know sheila .
she &apos;s like a surgeon , and the files are her patients .
she doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
you told her about this ?
hell no .
she told me not to touch any of those files ,
and she &apos;d kill me if she found out that i did .
i just asked her about it generally .
well , of course she &apos;s gonna say she never loses one ,
but i can tell you from personal experience ,
anything can happen to a file .
i don &apos;t know.- well , i do .
i know mike , and i know he &apos;s for real .
but if you still doubt it , there &apos;s an easy answer .
just call up harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript .
and what if it &apos;s not there ?
then i will apologize for calling you insane
and personally help you escort mike ross out of the building .
good @-@ bye .
in 2002 , you were sued for the malfunctioning
of an earlier model of the heart stent .
is that correct ?
yes , and we admitted wrongdoing .
the stent that was installed in your patient was a new model
developed through three years of extensive trials .
making it outside the scope , and frankly , not a good argument
for establishing pattern .
they saw a problem , and they fixed it .
how horrible , we should sue them .
we &apos;re not in court .
opening statements are made before a judge ,
or have you never been in court before ?
i just wanted to give you a taste ,
seeing as we &apos;re never actually gonna get there .
a dismissal is never gonna happen , son .
sorry for your loss , son .
what ?
i &apos;m saying , don &apos;t hope for a dismissal .
please direct your questions to our client .
that wasn &apos;t a question . it was a comment .
here &apos;s a question for you , mr. dimond .
what is this really worth to you ?
you may think you have a defense .
your lawyer certainly thinks you do .
but i just want to be clear about the facts .
what is this really worth to you ?
there &apos;s no question , this was a terrible accident .
but let &apos;s be clear about the facts .
his blood alcohol level is an issue here .
if you pursue this in court ,
there &apos;s no guarantee you &apos;ll receive anything .
think about the boy .
think about what he needs .
something is better than nothing .
stop stalling , mr. ross .
um , i--
he &apos;s not stalling .
and we &apos;re under no obligation
to disclose trials from an earlier model .
it &apos;s beyond the scope .
our expert will place that study within the scope .
if there isn &apos;t a trial ,
your expert won &apos;t have any scope to place it in .
and since you insist on asking questions
we &apos;re under no obligation to answer ,
this deposition is over .
what the hell happened in there ?
you said you wanted to watch , not hijack my case .
you said you were going to kick his ass ,
not drift into never @-@ never land .
i &apos;m handling it .
handling it ?
i could &apos;ve eaten that whole bag of peanuts
in the pause you took to answer that question .
you got thrown , and i bailed you out .
harvey , this is my case .
this is not your case . it &apos;s the client &apos;s case .
and after what happened in there ,
they &apos;re in a worse position than when we started .
look , i know i got thrown , but i can still recover .
maybe ,
but they &apos;re gonna call in a half an hour
wanting to take the deal ,
and when they do , i &apos;m gonna buy you one day ,
and then i &apos;m pulling the plug .
hey , do you have a minute ?
i &apos;m a little busy right now .
we have a problem .
scottie &apos;s not going to be a problem .
i thought it through--
louis might be onto mike .
he found out that mike doesn &apos;t have a file
in the harvard file room
and that he wasn &apos;t on your original interview list .
what did you tell him ?
well , i handled the list .
what about the other ?
what could i tell him ?
i mean , i told him if he was so curious ,
he could order a copy of mike &apos;s transcript .
then we don &apos;t have a problem .
well , don &apos;t you think maybe we should do something else ?
anything else is just going to make him more suspicious .
are you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
okay .
oh , wait a second .
where did you say louis was again ?
oh , he was in the harvard file room .
how was he in the harvard file room ?
he has a relationship with sheila sazs .
what ?
yeah , never mind . we &apos;re good .
oh , thank you ,
but i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t have time .
it &apos;s food . it &apos;s not going to stop you .
it &apos;s going to keep you going .
yeah , i don &apos;t need food .
i need to find something i can take
to this dismissal hearing tomorrow .
mike , it was a pretty decent settlement .
would it really be so bad to just take it ?
my dad was one of those guys
who liked to celebrate everything--
the half birthdays or first time
i struck someone out at little league .
and the last time i saw them ,
they were celebrating the anniversary of their first date .
they were so excited , all dressed up ,
and i was annoyed ,
because i didn &apos;t want to
spend the night at my grandmother &apos;s house .
so before they left ,
my dad came upstairs to say good @-@ bye ,
and i told him that celebrating a first date was stupid .
and he just looks at me like ,
&quot; michael , you have no idea
how important a first date can be . &quot;
theirs must have been a great one .
no , no , no , it was a total disaster .
he spilled wine all over her . he forgot his wallet .
and then , for some reason , this woman , you know--
this woman who he knew was just perfect--
agreed to a second date .
and a third .
and everything after that .
i wish i could have met them .
he tried to hug me good @-@ bye ...
but i didn &apos;t hug him back .
i didn &apos;t even go downstairs to say good @-@ bye to my mom .
and then they were gone .
and then the next morning , rinaldi shows up at our house ,
and he offers my grandmother
the equivalent of one year &apos;s rent .
rinaldi didn &apos;t kill my parents ,
but he did try to tell me what their lives were worth .
and i &apos;m sorry , but i know that my mom and dad were worth ...
a lot more than that .
forget the food .
give me half the files .
what about a hedge fund guy ? it &apos;s big money .
think bigger .
obama .
i &apos;m not going to land the president
as my first client .
fine , if you don &apos;t think you can .
you &apos;re not going to manipulate me into trying to land obama .
well , it better be somebody like that ,
or jessica won &apos;t give up on her early buy @-@ in bullshit .
what if i got myself a sports guy ?
the very fact that you call it &quot; a sports guy &quot;
means it &apos;s a no .
harvey , just because i don &apos;t know sports
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t know you .
what are you talking about ?
if i &apos;m going to change jessica &apos;s mind ,
i can &apos;t just land someone ,
i have to land someone you couldn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no one i couldn &apos;t land .
you think i don &apos;t know about beijing ?
that &apos;s his word against mine .
i guess we can clear that up right now ,
because look who just walked in .
you knew he was coming here tonight ?
you think i like argentinean food ?
i just need you to stop him for a second .
i get it .
you got the idea from working girl ,
when they crash the wedding to get to trask radio .
harvey , i &apos;m not a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
i don &apos;t get my ideas from movies .
michael .
harvey .
i have no interest in talking to you .
hi . dana scott .
i work with harvey , and i don &apos;t blame you .
i wouldn &apos;t want him to represent me either .
but he &apos;s not the only lawyer there .
let me guess .
you &apos;ve done your research on my record ,
and you &apos;re here to impress me .
that &apos;s what every other lawyer would do .
i didn &apos;t do that .
harvey , shut up .
i don &apos;t give a shit about how fast you used to swim .
i only care about how fast i can make you money .
how fast is that ?
why don &apos;t you sit down , and i &apos;ll tell you ?
all right .
okay .
harvey , you mind ?
actually , i--
great .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
good to see you , buddy .
so what really happened in beijing ?
let &apos;s get a drink first .
sounds good .
doctor , how routine is this procedure ?
sid foreman should have been dancing
at his daughter &apos;s wedding a week later .
instead , he went into heart failure .
dr. lombard , on december 7 , 2006,
did a patient die on your table
during a routine angioplasty ?
objection , your honor . relevance ?
it speaks to his qualifications as an expert witness , your honor .
i &apos;ll allow .
yes , a patient died .
and was a malpractice suit filed against you for physician error ?
that case was sealed .
i didn &apos;t ask you if it was sealed .
i asked if it was filed .
it was .
and settled ?
for almost nothing--
objection , your honor .
move to strike . the case is sealed .
the witness isn &apos;t allowed to testify
to the details of that settlement .
sustained .
have you practiced medicine since ?
yes , i &apos;ve been practicing .
i &apos;m sorry , what i meant to say is have you performed surgery ,
the job you spent seven years training to do ?
no .
what , loss of confidence ?
they wouldn &apos;t let you ?
objection . speculation .
i want an answer to my question .
i chose to do other things .
other things that don &apos;t involve the chance of you killing people ?
objection !
withdrawn .
what &apos;s your primary source of income ?
i work as an expert witness .
so you testify now to make a living ,
because you don &apos;t trust yourself to do the job
that you were trained to do ?
i can speak to the facts of this case--
yes , you can speak to them ,
but how are we supposed to trust your opinion about them
when you clearly don &apos;t trust yourself ?
you raised some doubts about my expert .
that isn &apos;t gonna get this case dismissed .
maybe not , but if that &apos;s the best expert you can come up with ,
then your client just got a taste of how this trial is gonna go .
my client is not gonna drop this case ,
and neither am i.
well , then you are forcing me to use this .
it &apos;s a picture of mr. foreman at his daughter &apos;s wedding .
it &apos;s a picture of mr. foreman drinking alcohol
at his daughter &apos;s wedding .
it &apos;s a toast . it was one sip .
one sip two hours before his stent supposedly malfunctioned .
alcohol was strictly forbidden following his surgery ,
which makes him liable for his own death .
this is a total twisting of the facts .
you can &apos;t prove this caused anything .
you can &apos;t prove it was only one sip ,
and it doesn &apos;t matter , because i submit this ,
it &apos;s contributory negligence , and your case is gone .
and you say i &apos;m a monster .
being a monster would be putting your client
on the stand and making her testify
that her husband &apos;s death was his own damn fault .
hi , donna .
hi , louis .
i &apos;m nothing if not a big man ,
and i am not ashamed to admit when i am wrong .
you got mike &apos;s transcript .
arrived this morning .
imagine that , mike ross went to harvard .
what a shocker .
you were right .
never should have doubted it .
you know , it &apos;s just hard to imagine a world
in which sheila made a mistake , though .
well , it &apos;s just good you can put this to bed
once and for all .
yeah , see , that &apos;s the thing .
if sheila &apos;s competence is that important to her ,
i need to tell her about this , so she can fix it .
you know what , louis ?
it occurred to me after we talked
that i &apos;m the only one who has the list of associates
that interviewed with harvey that day .
that can &apos;t be right ,
&apos;cause i got a copy off the general server .
you got a copy by bullying benjamin
into accessing my private files off my hard drive .
that doesn &apos;t sound like me .
louis .
okay , i did it , but that was only &apos; cause i was concerned .
so your concern gives you the right to invade my privacy ?
i ... what ? no , it was just a file .
how dare you ?
you pretend to be this gallant man .
you make a big show of how you would never cross into my area
without my permission .
i am gallant , and i would never dare .
you wouldn &apos;t dare , because you &apos;d have to do it to my face .
but you have no problem breaking my trust behind my back ,
and that not only pisses me off ,
but it makes me question ...
whether i want to have a relationship with you at all .
i &apos;m so sorry , donna .
no , louis , you know what ...
no , no , no , donna , i &apos;m sorry .
no , i can &apos;t .
no , no , no , no .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t even ...
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
no , shh ! don &apos;t speak .
i cannot even look at you right now .
and i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m gonna tell you this ,
but if you pissed me off that much ,
what do you think sheila &apos;s gonna do
when you tell her you violated her trust ?
you &apos;re right .
thank you , donna ,
for putting your anger on hold long enough to help me salvage
the single most important non @-@ feline relationship of my life .
someone &apos;s been a bad boy .
sheila .
you thought i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
i hoped you wouldn &apos;t .
if you wanted a pair of my underwear ,
you should have just asked .
oh , that , sheila .
god , what are you doing here ?
aren &apos;t you happy i &apos;m here ?
of course , absolutely .
you don &apos;t seem happy .
i &apos;m overjoyed .
i &apos;m just , you know ... i &apos;m just surprised .
but you &apos;re all nervous and sweaty .
come on , you know my sweat ducts get excited
when they see you .
good .
because your sweat ducts are going to be working overtime .
what ?
the chilton , room 305 , tonight .
you didn &apos;t have to come all the way over here
just to drop the case .
i came here to tell you you &apos;re doing the wrong thing .
i don &apos;t need a lecture from you on right and wrong .
you once asked me how i live with myself .
well , somewhere along the way , i realized i had a choice
not to be on the side that made me feel like shit .
you &apos;re on that side now .
yeah , i don &apos;t feel like shit .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re telling yourself you &apos;re doing your job .
and i &apos;m telling you that you &apos;re bullying someone
who deserves your sympathy .
you really want to play the bullying card ?
my grandmother lost her only son .
you used her grief against her .
this has nothing to do with that .
look , i know , you need me to be the villain ...
no , no , no , no , no .
you are the villain .
well , then congratulations , because you just became me .
what are you talking about ?
your father had two drinks on the night he was killed .
that was the reason i was able to get your grandmother to settle .
it &apos;s not every day i get off the elevator
and find someone in my firm that makes me look short .
so you &apos;ve seen our newest client ?
you mean scottie &apos;s newest client .
michael phelps may be her client ,
but we &apos;re gonna get speedo .
and why should that make me change my mind ?
because their fee is worth more than her buy @-@ in .
you still think this is about money .
i told this to scottie , and now i &apos;m going to tell it to you .
we &apos;ve had too much turnover .
we can &apos;t have any more .
jessica , i &apos;m telling you she &apos;s in .
then she shouldn &apos;t have any problem
putting her money where her mouth is .
it &apos;s not right .
harvey , it &apos;s time you and i had the talk .
i know where babies come from .
but do you know how couples stay together ?
what are you getting at ?
when daniel and i took over the firm ,
we had a heart @-@ to @-@ heart .
he had a philosophy that i agreed to live by .
daniel was a piece of shit .
doesn &apos;t mean his philosophy was .
i &apos;m listening .
he told me , for a partnership to work ,
there has to be trust between number one and number two .
you don &apos;t have to agree with me ,
but you have to trust that i listen to you ,
that my decisions are reasoned ,
and that i am doing what i think is right .
jessica--
you can &apos;t have two presidents , harvey .
now i chose to trust you when you said
you didn &apos;t want to be managing partner .
was that true or not ?
it was .
then i need you to accept this .
what if i had an idea
where maybe we can both get what we want ?
i &apos;m listening .
that &apos;s never happened to me before .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it isn &apos;t .
black hawk down .
first of all ,
that &apos;s an amazing movie , and you should be proud
that you are associated with it .
and second of all , i think i know what the problem is .
you do ?
it &apos;s about what happened in the file room .
listen , sheila , i can &apos;t tell you
how that &apos;s been weighing on my mind .
no , i get it .
now that we &apos;ve declared our love ,
you think of me as a good girl .
and you need me to be bad .
what ?
it happens all the time .
we &apos;re in a relationship now , and you think that changes
the nature of our sexual relationship .
but i am here to assure you ...
i can be bad .
okay , that &apos;s not actually what--
liar .
take it easy .
i am being serious right now .
you think i &apos;m not being serious ?
i &apos;m deadly serious .
say it again .
well , what do you know ?
the dark knight rises .
she went for it .
she did ?
one catch .
what ?
you have to sign an ironclad noncompete .
you can &apos;t represent any pearson specter clients
if you leave .
including phelps ?
including phelps .
how is that any different than paying in early ?
it &apos;s $ 1 / 2 million different .
harvey .
scottie , this is the best we &apos;re gonna do .
phelps brings in the money .
but if you leave and take him away ,
what good does that do jessica ?
jessica or you ?
are you kidding ? are you questioning me ?
you &apos;ve been known to manipulate situations before .
if it were up to me , i &apos;d waive your whole buy @-@ in .
now i know you &apos;re full of shit .
you &apos;re right , i am .
so get your check ready , &apos; cause in six months , you &apos;re paying it .
are we really doing this ?
sign it . give it to jessica .
tomorrow we &apos;ll celebrate with dinner at my place .
where did you get this ?
rinaldi .
mike , i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but your father wasn &apos;t legally drunk .
yeah , but he wasn &apos;t sober either .
and how do i know those two drinks aren &apos;t
the split second that he needed not to ...
you don &apos;t know that this had
anything to do with the accident .
rachel , do you have any idea how many times i have wished
that they hadn &apos;t gone out that night
or that they had taken a different route home
or any one of a thousand other things ,
but the one thing--the one thing that i never wished
is that my father hadn &apos;t been drinking
the night that he got killed by a drunk--
i know he wasn &apos;t perfect .
but he was .
he was perfect to me , and ...
i don &apos;t want to have to wonder
if this is all his fault .
mike .
he is just trying to get to you .
well , he &apos;s got to me .
i mean , how am i any different than him , rachel ?
because it &apos;s a bullshit claim .
i don &apos;t know .
i know i &apos;m gonna win .
but i don &apos;t know .
here you are .
been looking all over for you .
why ?
i just wanted to apologize once again
for crossing the threshold of your electronic area .
it &apos;s okay , louis .
no , no , i breached your mainframe .
no excuse .
why is your face so red ?
it &apos;s because you gave me the greatest advice in the world .
what are you talking about ?
let &apos;s just say that i &apos;m never gonna tell sheila what i did
in that file room that night , ever .
apology accepted .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i need to put some peas on my face .
your move didn &apos;t work . i didn &apos;t go into a tailspin .
i wasn &apos;t trying to send you into a tailspin .
i was just trying to get you to understand .
well , i do understand .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna sell my client out .
then why are we here ?
you want to sue someone , you should sue these people .
they &apos;re the ones that make the medicine
that stent was coated with .
and you know that medicine has something to do with this case ?
i know there &apos;s as much evidence against them
as there is against my client .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re pointing me there ,
because they &apos;re not your client .
you know , nothing &apos;s gonna bring mr. foreman back .
just like there &apos;s nothing
that &apos;s gonna bring my parents back .
this is the best way i can see to get your client compensation .
if you think you &apos;re doing the right thing , you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m trying to help ,
but i &apos;m not gonna sell my client out .
it &apos;s a half measure .
all right , then here &apos;s the other half .
i pointed out your achilles &apos; heel
when i found that photo , and i found it on facebook .
do your client a favor , and have them take it down
before you file that suit .
so you &apos;re gonna fly back to london , get your life in order ,
and move back in two weeks .
tickets are booked .
here &apos;s to your new partnership .
i just have one question .
why did jessica specifically make me agree to something
that &apos;s a standard part of your contracts ?
you checked up on me .
i didn &apos;t check up on you . i &apos;m thorough .
what &apos;s the difference ?
god damn it , harvey , don &apos;t change the subject .
what did you do ?
i fronted your buy @-@ in .
i knew it . you bought me .
i didn &apos;t buy you , i bought us time .
that is a lawyer &apos;s response , and it &apos;s bullshit .
how could you do that ?
scottie , you &apos;re acting like i killed someone .
i didn &apos;t .
you paid so that i could sleep with you
and be here at the same time !
do you know what that makes me ?
lucky ?
that &apos;s not funny .
i didn &apos;t mean it to be .
i paid because i want you to stay .
i did it as a romantic gesture .
yeah , well , pretty woman may have been a romantic movie ,
but julia roberts was still a hooker .
now you come up with a movie reference ?
harvey , can you imagine how that makes me feel
to find that out ?
well , what do you want me to say , huh ?
i &apos;m not perfect at this ,
and you don &apos;t have to believe that was romantic ,
but it would be nice if you believed that i thought it was .
harvey , it would have been romantic
if you had begged me to stay when jessica wouldn &apos;t budge ,
but this , this is not romantic .
this is manipulative .
you were about to take a job somewhere else .
that &apos;s what makes it manipulative !
are you telling me you &apos;ve never been manipulative with me ?
not since i &apos;ve been back .
i had to learn the hard way ,
and i &apos;m afraid that you haven &apos;t learned that at all .
so you &apos;re saying i &apos;m an asshole ?
yes , that is what i &apos;m saying , that you are an asshole ,
but what i &apos;m really saying
is that we need to start being honest with each other .
about everything ?
everything .
you know that paper you had to redo ,
because professor gunn said he never got it ?
he never got it .
son of a bitch .
how was i supposed to know
you didn &apos;t save it to your hard drive ?
because i told you that .
you know i don &apos;t listen when you say things .
you are an asshole .
this is good .
honesty is good .
i told rebecca carlin you were gay .
she slept with me anyway .
once .
yeah .
why did she only sleep with me once ?
because i also told her that you had crabs .
that &apos;s not cool .
this is good .
it is .
i am in this , scottie .
okay .
so am i.
well , let &apos;s see what you got , michael james ross .
magna cum laude .
so mr . smarty pants couldn &apos;t even manage summa cum laude ?
yeah , well , so what if i couldn &apos;t either ?
what ? no law review ?
well , either you weren &apos;t asked , or you didn &apos;t serve .
either way , i win .
&quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a. &quot;
b @-@ plus in international law ?
oh , come on , i aced that class with my eyes closed .
&quot; a &quot; in contracts . that &apos;s legit .
a @-@ minus in estate planning ?
remind me to not die intestate with mike ross around .
tape measure , as requested .
you look really excited .
long day .
i know .
is there any chance we can punt this ,
maybe go grab some dinner ?
we could , or we could accept that moving in together
sometimes means we have to just shake off our crappy days
and deal with things like furniture negotiations .
yeah , that doesn &apos;t sound
like anything i want to accept at all .
too bad .
this is your life now .
rachel , look , i &apos;m trying ...
you said that your dad liked to celebrate the little things ,
and i thought maybe we should start doing that too .
you mean like furniture negotiations ?
i mean our first date .
so does that mean i &apos;m not gonna be able to eat anything ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t like anything on the menu that night .
that wasn &apos;t our first date .
our first date was in the law library .
sushi .
sushi .
that was my first case .
i know .
oh , you were so green .
harvey came in and told us to stop playing footsie .
oh , i remember that .
i wanted to do a lot more than play footsie with you .
i know .
i caught you staring at me five times .
oh , so i guess you didn &apos;t catch all the other times then .
i did , just trying to let you off the hook .
rachel ...
this is perfect .
not yet .
now it is .
so where &apos;s the chair ?
no .
you wanted to see me ?
professor gerard &apos;s legal ethics class--you take it ?
of course , everyone had to take it .
what &apos;d you get ?
killed it . i got an a @-@ minus .
out of curiosity ,
did you ever hear of anybody ever getting an a @-@ plus ?
what ? no .
he &apos;s famous for never giving higher than an &quot; a. &quot;
he doesn &apos;t believe in it .
thank you , simon . that &apos;ll be all .
