johnny you explain the other thing i want to talk about
sure tony we &apos;ve discovered you bought property

that property &apos;s hot because of the esplanade

if the soprano family &apos;s gonna benefit from a thing

i &apos;ve been your doctor for 30 years you still hate the thermometer
tony furio &apos;s here !
thank you for bringing those strufoli i love those
here &apos;s a few long @-@ term bonds that i find attractive
wouldn &apos;t it be great if the person you trust most was your broker ?
let &apos;s look at your allocations at schwab we give advice
that &apos;s not driven by commission
call 1 @-@ 800 @-@ 7 @-@ schwab to set up a consultation
to check the health of your portfolio
and lay off the junk bonds
i got pictures of my new house
let me see
welcome back we &apos;re here today with our guests dr del redclay
who &apos;s a professor of anthropology at rutgers university ...
and spokesman for the anti @-@ columbus protest
my god
and also mr phillip l di notti ...
it &apos;s lovely
... a coalition of italian @-@ american anti @-@ defamation organizations
okay
this thing gets on my nerves
don &apos;t get me started
well let &apos;s start with the idea of a parade for a genocidal colonial general
a national holiday no less
such festivities are deeply offensive to us
these are pretty broad charges
all i know
is italian americans are extremely proud of christopher columbus ...
admiral of the ocean seas and a great italian
you know very well of the compromised position we put forth
now if you people wanna make it an italian pride parade ...
we have no problem with that
western history says columbus discovered america
the same america that put your people in bondage for three centuries
but every culture has had to bear the pain ...
in the making of what i think we can all agree
is a startling economic miracle
we cured polio
i have to agree with phil
the right to vote
exactly
take my grandparents two simple people from sicily ...
who braved the perilous middle passage ...
middle passage ? that &apos;s the term for the slave trade
montel the italian people in this country also have suffered discrimination
earth to phil
we &apos;re talking 300 years of slavery here
enough
you okay tony ? you look a little muscia @-@ moosh
uncle jun &apos;s trial starts today
first soprano family trial in 16 years
we should go
the guys are gonna be at the other place
thank you for the cookies
and congratulations on that house
and i like the kitchen
take a strufoli
be seated
next case on the calendar ...
united states of america versus corrado john soprano et al
any applications before i bring in the jury ?
no your honor bring the jury
telephone charges on your last bill ?
cost me $ 40 every time you pick up the phone
i can &apos;t ...
$ 2.380 last month alone
i &apos;m going to give you some preliminary instructions ...
and explain the process by which we will try this case
the first order of business ...
looking out at this audience of proud strong beautiful women ...
how far we have come in this american journey
look how we &apos;ve both preserved the tradition of our ancestors ...
and managed to become new italian @-@ american women
such flair we have added to our image
and yet america still sees us ...
as pizza makers and mama leones
it is your job ladies to spread the word
our grandmothers may have been dressed in black ...
but we &apos;re in moschino and armani
for those who say italian americans eat smelly cheese
and sip cold wine ...
tell them we &apos;re from the land of aromatic asiago
and supple barolo
if they say &quot; spaghetti and meatballs ... &quot;
you tell them &quot; orecchiette with broccoli rabe &quot;
if they say &quot; john gotti &quot;
you tell them &quot; rudolph giuliani &quot;
a princeton study showed that 74 percent ...
of americans associated italian americans with organized crime
why would they do this ?
because of the way the media depict us
again it is our job to make sure people know ...
the other side of italian @-@ american culture
the educated wage @-@ earning law @-@ abiding side
because isn &apos;t that who we truly are ?
thank you
thank you professor murphy ...
or should i call you professor longo @-@ murphy ?
longo as you don &apos;t call me late for dinner
small point : didn &apos;t i read about
a more recent study at fairleigh dickinson that found the opposite was true ?
that the great majority of americans recognize these are fictional portrayals ?
we &apos;re still looking at the sample selection criteria used in that study
well thanks for an excellent talk
and thank you all for attending today
don &apos;t miss professor murphy &apos;s new book :
strega &apos; the sorceress as imago figure in italian literature
and stick around for coffee and dessert
courtesy of cocuzzo &apos;s pastry shop
i &apos;ll say it that was totally uncalled for
father intintola &apos;s forgetting his friends
it was outrageous i &apos;m shocked
everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion
really though how dare he ? after all you &apos;ve done for this parish
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna cut him a new one
father i don &apos;t know what to say i &apos;m so upset
why what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
carmela is one of your biggest supporters and friends
how dare you let her suffer humiliation and embarrassment ...
at the hands of an outsider ?
what do you mean ?
you know exactly what i mean
unfortunately because of her husband &apos;s high profile in the waste industry ...
she &apos;s the one who bears the brunt of insults
but there were many of us who were equally offended
i am sorry
this is an open forum
you did hear me bring up that new study
if that &apos;s your idea of a good luncheon speaker ...
i suggest you think about who really keeps ...
this parish alive year after year
the size of your cities pain the eyes of the red man
a man in your cities is numb to the stench ...
go back to your reservation !
mussolini was hitler &apos;s bitch !
go back !
in the words of chief seattle &apos;
&quot; for the last red man shall have perished ...
&quot; and the memory of my tribe ...
&quot; shall have become a myth among the white men ... &quot;
take your tom @-@ toms and get out of here ! you son of a bitch !
... &quot; these shores these woods
the highway will swarm with the invisible dead of our people !
the white man will never be alone ! &quot;
this is newark baby we don &apos;t play that shit !
and that better not be columbus !
take it down
he &apos;s going to burn ...
the way our ancestors did !

nobody wants to touch it
we just want a peaceful parade like always

it &apos;s the first amendment and it &apos;s native americans
very sensitive stuff
my hands are tied on this one
sorry
yeah fine -i will be attending the parade as always
you got my support there
i wish that i could ...
the last time that you dated a friend and colleague ...
of your brother &apos;s he left you flat
disappeared into the witness protection program
i know
now another man ...
who works with your brother ...
unable to meet your basic needs for love and respect ...
involved with another woman
which brings me back to my childhood
and my mother
and my father
now we &apos;re talking
where i had no love and no support
and where i was shamed and ridiculed for being artistic
in your relationship with these men ...
you have replaced your father with your brother ...
as a figure of authority that you need to prove something to
you set up these scenarios with these men ...
similar to your father and your brother seeking your brother ...
i e ... your father &apos;s acceptance
the hell with them
i know
the work is to make new choices ...
that have nothing to do with old patterns
i want to sandy i do
god give me the strength
she will
your star @-@ ledger interview conflicts with eye on new jersey
del redclay right ? i knew it

i &apos;m henry caruso pleased to meet you
now this lovely lady ...
maggie donner i &apos;m del &apos;s ta
yes i can see that
well i might as well get to the point
i represent a group of concerned citizens who are ...
very upset about this protest you &apos;re spearheading
no puns intended
who do you represent ?
italians
here in new jersey
good people
family people
and they &apos;ve asked me to tell you that ...
it &apos;s not in your best interest to go through with this
if you &apos;ve come here to intimidate me you don &apos;t know much about indian resolve
should i call security ?
you remember this guy ?
iron eyes cody he was an actor
son of paleface sitting bull
your fucking poster boy
part cherokee part cree
he wasn &apos;t even a fucking indian
second generation sicilian
from louisiana named espera decorti
i think you better leave now
the guy &apos;s a total fucking phony
a total fugace
even jay silverheels knew it
but he kept it quiet
we &apos;re not gonna
you keep up your bullshit
we &apos;re gonna go wide with this thing
knock yourself out
jesus christ is this true ?
this is a fucking disaster !
chill out you didn &apos;t know about this ?
it &apos;s been on access hollywood e ! ...
this is a major pr boner
it &apos;s been researched cody was definitely
native american total environmentalist
are you sure about this ?
look i &apos;m one @-@ eighth italian myself
you are ? you never told me that
my great @-@ great something or other was a pony soldier
well actually he was a violinist attached to the seventh cavalry
that is just one person &apos;s opinion anthony
what football again ?
he &apos;s not gonna get hurt he &apos;s a tough kid
jesus
we &apos;re having a discussion about christopher columbus
&quot; they would make fine servants
&quot; with 50 men we could subgate them ... &quot;
subjugate
... &quot; and make them do whatever we want &quot;
that doesn &apos;t sound like a slave trader to you ?
george washington had slaves
the father of our country
well what &apos;s your point ?
his history teacher mr cushman is teaching your son ...
that if columbus was alive today
he &apos;d go on trial for crimes against humanity like milosevic in you know europe
your teacher said that ? it &apos;s not just my teacher it &apos;s the truth
it &apos;s in my history book
so you finally read a book and it &apos;s bullshit
you had to walk in columbus &apos; shoes to see what he went through
people thought the world was flat for crying out loud
then he lands on an island with a bunch
of naked savages on it that took a lot of guts
you remember when we went to florida the heat and those bugs ?
like it took guts to murder people and put them in chains
he was a victim of his time
who cares ? it &apos;s what he did
he discovered america is what he did
he was a brave italian explorer
and in this house christopher columbus is a hero end of story
i should &apos;ve known
i should &apos;ve known you needed me
i should &apos;ve been with you
i should &apos;ve been in your place
my love
my sweet love
how he loved her
you know what i heard one time ?
sil was on the phone he was talking with somebody ...
about how bobby was the only one of them who doesn &apos;t have a cumare
they were laughing at him
who was he talking to on the phone ?
i don &apos;t know
i &apos;ll go first this time i &apos;ll bring my eggplant parm over to bobby &apos;s

some indians were deliberately given blankets tainted with smallpox
died like flies
no shit ?
yeah shit
yeah ? you wanna talk about terrorism ? look who started it
amen to that my friend
that &apos;s right
christopher columbus was no better than adolf hitler
back up hitler ?
yeah i &apos;m not the only one who thinks so
that indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness ?
they had him on t v ... and he called columbus hitler
&apos;cause it &apos;s true man
you &apos;re talking out of your ass
columbus and hitler ? you &apos;re trivializing the holocaust
frankly reuben if you got that kind of covert anti @-@ semitism ...

from the darkness and toward the light

janice ... -sandy he &apos;s different believe me
but back to ralph

speak the truth jan ...
but with the compassion and respect that you &apos;re famous for and say goodbye ...
for his sake as well as yours
