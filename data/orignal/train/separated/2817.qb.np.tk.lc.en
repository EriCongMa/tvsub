whose idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates ?
some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box .
oh , my god ! they took my idea !
that was you ?
okay , there you go .
rachel , i made you cocoa .
oh , that &apos;s so ....
oh , my god ! are you guys okay ?
oh , my .
the one with a chick and a duck
you know , with that goatee , you kind of look like satan .
so that &apos;s why the priest threw holy water on me .
you have to cheer up .
you should come out with ross and me .
anything is better than sitting here crying all day about kate .
i was crying because nobody believed quincy &apos;s theory .
i &apos;m gonna be on tv !
no way !
they &apos;re putting together a panel to talk about the fossils in peru .
the discovery channel &apos;s filming it !
oh , my god ! who &apos;s gonna watch that ?
thanks . you ready to go ?
i saw a girl with that vest .
thanks .
most of us think of chocolate and baskets as traditional easter gifts .
some people insist on giving live chicks as presents .
unfortunately , most of these guys won &apos;t live to see the 4th of july .
as a result of improper care , they will be dead .
you guys got any of those baby chicks ?
i was watching this commercial on tv , and , man , those things are cute !
pete , you &apos;re back ! hey , check this out !
skates !
you &apos;re sturdier than chandler . he crumbled like a piece of paper .
how was your trip ?
what &apos;d you bring me ?
hotel toiletries from japan !
these are gonna go in my permanent collection .
you know what that says in english ? made in texas .
want some coffee ?
that &apos;d be great .
regular or decaf ?
whichever &apos;s closest .
ask me what i did today .
what did you do today ?
i bought a restaurant and i &apos;d like you to be the chef .
can you believe he offered me a restaurant ?
what a jerk . you want me to kick his ass ?
it &apos;s been my dream since i got my first easy @-@ bake oven ...
... and opened easy @-@ monica &apos;s bakery .
i would kill for this job . i can totally do this job ...
... and god knows , i &apos;ve paid my dues .
but pete &apos;s doing this because he has a crush on me .
and you &apos;re still not attracted to him at all ?
how could i accept a restaurant from him ? i can &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t accept a necklace from stu vincent in the 7th grade .
but , mon , that was totally different . he was your health teacher .
what , honey ?
my side hurts from when you crashed into me .
oh , god , i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , god !
hey , you guys . guess what ?
got a job on a riverboat ?
i didn &apos;t wear this suit for a year , because you hated it .
you &apos;re not my girlfriend anymore , so ....
i see . this suit is making a point .
now that you &apos;re on your own , you &apos;re free to look as stupid as you &apos;d like .
you like it , right ?
i like it even more on you than i did on colonel sanders .
ross , i &apos;m kidding . come here .
what were you gonna tell us ?
was it how you invented the cotton gin ?
okay , goodbye .
was that a little harsh ?
are you kidding ?
remember when you used to wear that gray sweat suit .
and l used to call you the hindenberg .
no . my mistake
so after you put the suggestion in the box ...
... how long did it take for it to happen ?
about three months .
so i guess that &apos;s about two weeks before the topless thing kicks in .
i got you something . open it ! open it !
it &apos;s a chicken .
it &apos;s cute , huh ?
you guys ? do you know anything about chicks ?
fowl ? no .
women ? no .
they are a huge responsibility .
especially at this age . they require constant care .
they need just the right food and lots and lots of love .
well , no problem there .
easy , lenny .
so , i mean , have you thought about it ?
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
not &quot; the thing . &quot; i hate &quot; the thing . &quot;
what &apos;s &quot; the thing &quot; ?
i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m sorry . i wish i could ...
... but you have these feelings for me .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about ?
if that &apos;s the problem , we &apos;ve got no problem .
i was gonna tell you over dinner , but i met somebody else , on my trip .
her name &apos;s ann . she &apos;s a journalist . we met on the plane .
she wanted to finish off my peanuts .
i thought she said something else . we had a big laugh .
i got tired of waiting .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m so happy for you .
now i can work for you !
i guess you can .
oh , my god ! this is incredible !
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna roll right into that office and quit !
all right !
could you give me a little push ?
good luck !
i &apos;m quitting !
i &apos;m okay ! i &apos;m all right !
that &apos;s exciting . you went to japan , made up a woman .
what ?
i &apos;m just saying , this &quot; woman , &quot; i mean , she &apos;s fictitious , no ?
why would you say that ?
you &apos;re still into monica .
you said there &apos;s somebody else so she &apos;d work with you .
if you spend time together , maybe something might happen .
you &apos;re good . you &apos;re good .
no , i &apos;m fairly intuitive . and psychic .
it &apos;s a substantial gift .
can you promise me that you won &apos;t tell her ?
absolutely . i promise . tell her what ?
thanks a lot .
no , i &apos;m serious . i &apos;m intuitive , but my memory sucks .
okay , but this is the last time .
with a chick @-@ chick here and a chick @-@ chick there
here a chick , there a chick everywhere a chick @-@ chick
chicken ....
how &apos;s she doing ?
she ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a she ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t tell . whatever it was went back in too quickly .
i gotta change . i &apos;m meeting some of the cast for drinks .
excuse me ?
what ?
i stayed home while you were at rehearsal ...
... so somebody could be here with our chick .
who was up from 2 : 00 this morning until 5 : 00 ...
... trying to get her back to sleep ?
you don &apos;t think i get up when you get up ?
oh , here it comes .
yes ! here it comes ! i &apos;m stuck here all day !
and then you come in and spend two seconds with us ...
... and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends ?
well , i don &apos;t think so , mister !
i need to relax , okay ? i was working all day .
and you don &apos;t think taking care of our chick is work ?
that &apos;s not what i said . i just meant
i know what you meant !
did you notice that ever since we got this chick ...
... we &apos;ve been fighting a lot more than we used to ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe we weren &apos;t ready to have a chick .
l sure want one someday though .
l know. l know .
i &apos;ll take her back tomorrow .
we &apos;ll get our $ 3 back ?
l can &apos;t believe you still have that .
we &apos;re taking her back .
no , that ridiculous thing on your face .
thank you .
all right ?
i have that tv thing in two hours , and i need your help .
what do you think ? this blue suit or this brown one ?
the brown one brings out your eyes .
but your butt looks great in the blue one .
really ?
that aspirin dance really works .
ls that still ... ?
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not !
yes , i am .
look , i &apos;m fine . watch . look at that .
you &apos;ve got to go to a doctor , okay ?
i have to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss &apos;s house .
there &apos;s people there that i have to meet .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a great impression . &quot; hi , i &apos;m rachel .
it &apos;s nice to meet you . &quot;
come on , you probably have a broken rib .
i &apos;ll go to the hospital tomorrow . it &apos;ll still be broken then .
but you know , i could use a hand getting ready .
either help me , or go .
fine . i &apos;ll go .
but before you go , could you help me first ?
sure . i &apos;ll help you .
good ! do you guys know how to get a chick out of a vcr ?
you know what ? i cannot do this with my left hand .
would you please help me with this too ?
let &apos;s use this brush .
this stuff ?
careful .
light .
just sweep it across the lid . just sweep it .
sorry !
that &apos;s just poking me in the eye .
i &apos;m sorry . close ....
just sweep it .
i &apos;m sweeping .
sweep , sweep ....
now make it even , because we don &apos;t ....
i don &apos;t want it to be too much . i want it to be subtle .
you don &apos;t wear enough of this .
since when do you think i don &apos;t wear enough of this ?
close your eye . you &apos;re gonna like this better ....
close , close .
blow it .
because i think this will make you a little more sophisticated .
sophisticated like a hooker ?
guess what i &apos;m doing tonight .
what ?
i &apos;m checking out the restaurant with pete .
monica , i am so excited for you !
i have to tell you something .
what ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier to tell me something that you could tell me ?
well , sure , in a perfect world .
but no . i promised i wouldn &apos;t tell , and i swore to all my gods .
does it have to do with ross and rachel ?
does it have to do with joey ?
does it have to do with chandler and that sock he keeps by his bed ?
no , but let &apos;s come back to that later .
there you go ! good enough for your party ?
sure .
sure . i &apos;ll just sit next to the transsexual from purchasing .
all right , i gotta go , so good luck at the party .
could you just stay and help me get dressed ?
sure .
great . okay , just turn around .
what ?
i don &apos;t want you to see me naked .
i &apos;ve seen you naked a million times . i ate hot fudge off you naked .
i sucked that mini @-@ marshmallow out of your bellybutton .
yeah , but that was different . we were going out then .
now it &apos;s weird .
rach , you know , i can see you naked anytime i want .
what ?
all i have to do is close my eyes . see ?
ross , stop that !
come on ! don &apos;t think of me like that anymore .
sorry . nothing you can do about it .
it &apos;s one of my rights as the ex @-@ boyfriend .
stop it ! cut it out ! cut it out !
i &apos;m sorry . it will never happen
wait a minute ! wait , wait ....
now there are 100 of you , and i &apos;m the king !
would you grow up ? it &apos;s no big deal .
all right . fine .
see what you did ? i &apos;m gonna be doing it by myself now .
oh , my god . all right , look , look ....
easy . easy . you have to go to the hospital , okay ?
i do . i really do .
i &apos;ll get your coat , then i &apos;ll put you in a cab .
you &apos;re not gonna come with me ?
of course i am .
i just have to make a call .
thank you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t go to the hospital looking like this .
does it involve travel ?
does it involve clogs ?
clogs or claws ?
clogs .
claws ?
so it doesn &apos;t involve ross or rachel or chandler or joey .
what about pete ? no
what is it ?
what about pete ?
i don &apos;t know !
i feel like i &apos;m talking to lassie .
phoebe , would you just tell me ?
i can &apos;t !
i gotta go .
but you &apos;re so close !
something to do with pete &apos;s company ?
go ! you &apos;ll never get it !
i know .
see , yes . that &apos;s yasmine bleeth .
she &apos;s a completely different kind of chick .
i love you both .
but in very different ways .
what are you doing ? you were gonna take her back .
i did . but the store wouldn &apos;t take her back .
then i took her to the shelter . you know what i found out ?
if they can &apos;t find a home for her , they kill her !
i won &apos;t let that happen to little jasmine .
good , good , because i was kind of having second thoughts too .
and it &apos;s not just chicks . it &apos;s all kinds of other animals .
that &apos;s horrible . you did the right thing .
thanks . i &apos;m glad you see it that way .
funny story !
i don &apos;t believe this !
look at this refrigerator ! it &apos;s gigantic !
i could live in this thing ! i &apos;d be cold , but i &apos;m always cold !
oh , my god ! look at these spider burners ! i love spider burners !
so you like it ?
it is so perfect ! thank you so much .
you &apos;re welcome .
did you just smell my hair ?
no ! no way ! what ?
oh , god .
what ?
you still have feelings for me .
i &apos;m just excited about the restaurant , that &apos;s all .
i love you . is that so bad ?
no , it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s not bad at all .
it &apos;s really nice .
the only one who stands to get hurt is me , and i &apos;m okay with that .
you may be okay with getting hurt ...
... but i am not okay with being the one who hurts you .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t take this job .
what ?
we probably shouldn &apos;t see each other anymore .
i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , if that &apos;s really what you want , okay .
i &apos;m sorry things
shut up for a second and let me just see something .
you &apos;d tell me the truth ?
rach , you can &apos;t look fat in an x @-@ ray .
now you stay out here and you think about what you did !
that &apos;s a duck !
that &apos;s a bad duck !
how &apos;d the thing go tonight , ross ?
what thing ? what thing ?
nothing . there was this thing at the museum . come on .
easy .
now , when you come back , i hope you remember that that chick is not a toy !
what &quot; thing &quot; ? what is this &quot; thing &quot; ?
i was kind of supposed to be on tv tonight for the discovery channel .
oh , my god !
ross , why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
i knew that if i told you , you &apos;d make me go ...
... and i knew you needed someone to be with you tonight . come on .
i cannot believe you .
what ?
that is the sweetest thing .
you should get some sleep .
sorry i spoiled your evening .
as long as you &apos;re okay .
so i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
see you .
what did you do ?
what you doing ?
having a swim .
what about the chick ?
chicks don &apos;t swim .
are you sure ?
i don &apos;t know .
should we try ?
sure .
see , i told you . they don &apos;t swim .
well , give him a minute .
