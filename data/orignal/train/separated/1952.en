The human brain.
This is the reason I asked Dr. Grey
If I could fill in for her this morning.
Nature makes a beautiful machine.
don't you think?
You might be surprised,
but anatomy classes can be uncomfortable for surgeons.
Ready to take it apart?
We're trained to put bodies back together.
We prefer our tissue warm, alive.
See how easily the blade slices through?
Comes apart like warm butter.
This big ball of jelly
is the essential element that makes you...
...You.
H-here's a fun fact.
If left to decompose, the brain actually liquifies.
usually when a surgeon is staring at dead tissue...
â€­- Look out!
Was it something I said?
means that something is very, very wrong.
oh, god.
oh, god, please, please.
Please, please, please.
Oh, no, no.
No!
Whoa.
Hey.
Oh, we had sex?
We had sex. Yeah, we had so much sex.
Yeah, we did. And it was great.
I don't mean to rush out, but, uh --
There are people in this house, and, um,
We had sex and you're an intern...
Yeah.
...So you -- you have to get out.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Stop. You -- there might be people out there.
There might be kids.
You have kids?
My sister has kids. My sister could see you.
I mean, I don't hear anyone.
I think we're okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah. We're fine.
Well. Good morning.
Hey.
Good morning.
You said you were drunk.
Can I at least ask if you used a condom?
Shut...Up.
Look, there is a jumbo box of condoms under the bathroom sink.
I share. They are for everyone.
Jumbo? Seriously?
I was being optimistic.
Wait.
That was you making all that noise last night?
I thought that was Amelia.
Well, you aren't shy. And you have a filthy mouth.
Okay, can we not talk about this?
Please. I am begging you.
So, the intern was good in bed.
Intern? What intern? Maggie, what intern?
Alex can hear us.
Alex doesn't care about this. Do you care, alex?
Do I care about any of this conversation? No.
Did he visit ladytown?
Because I find if they don't
Go down to ladytown the first time,
There should be no next time.
She's right about that.
No more talking!
If either of you says another word,
I will jump out of this car while it is moving.
And ladytown is just as bad as ladyplace.
Geez. So sensitive.
Just trying to be nice.
Take an interest. God.
Hey, what time do you want me at your house tonight?
Why are you coming to my house tonight?
You're having a dinner party.
Oh, the dinner party. No, that's not tonight.
No, that's weeks away. It's on the --
Dinner party's on the 14th, Alex.
Today is the 14th.
You people need adult supervision.
I don't think I'm gonna go to this dinner thing tonight.
I think I'm gonna work.
Jo, they don't hate you.
They don't like me.
They're your friends. They're my bosses.
It's like I'm on call all the time.
They -- they treat me like a resident,
not like a person, not like your girlfriend.
'cause they only ever see you here
'cause you never go to their parties.
Go to the party. I want them to know you.
It'll be fun, I promise.
Fun like a barium enema.
What?
Your boyfriend little posse controls this place.
Jo, you have an invite to the inner circle.
You go to that party, you make friends
with the chiefs of neuro, cardio, and general,
you would be unstoppable.
Every surgery in this hospital would be yours.
that -- that dinner...
I'd kill for an invite.
You're a little bit scary right now.
Edwards, my dear.
Let's roll.
Maybe I'll get an invite after all.
First neuro, then the world.
He didn't mean it, right?
I mean, you don't just
toss the word "Divorce" Out there like that.
It was just the heat of the moment, right?
Maybe he was just mad, or --
I'm the one who's mad.
"Divorce"? No. I refuse to accept it. Refuse.
Do you think he's going to that thing tonight?
oh, god. Probably.
Are you going? Please tell me you're going.
I don't know. I mean, Callie's gonna be there.
Since when's that been an issue? - It's not. It's just --
I don't want to make her new girlfriend feel uncomfortable.
You know, intimidated by me. Mm.
I mean, if she's even bringing her.
I don't know if she's bringing her. Do you?
Well, she's right over there.
Do you want me to ask her if she's bringing her girlfriend?
Yes, please.
You ask about Jackson, I'll ask about Penny.
10-4.
Oh, hey, um, about that thing tonight,
I'm not so sure any of them cook.
Should I bring food just in case so none of us starve?
You know, i think it's gonna be fine.
Um, do you know if --
Do you know if Jackson's coming tonight?
Uh, no idea.
Are you bringing Penny?
I hadn't --
Uh, I didn't know if you'd be okay with that.
And, uh -- yeah, I didn't want it to be awkward
or uncomfortable for her, you know. M--
Okay? Me?
Oh, I'm fine.
Are you kidding?
No, bring her. Totally.
Bring her, 'cause, i mean, I want to meet her.
I mean, I think that we all want to meet her.
Yeah. I mean, not just me.
Mostly me 'cause I --
I know that I would really love to meet her.
Yeah.
I mean...
I will see if she's available.
Cool, cool.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
See? I can do this.
I can do this. I'm excited.
It's cool, I'm cool.
Yeah, cool people don't say they're cool.
Rachel Bishop, 32,
Post-op day one following decompressive craniotomy.
isn't able to respond verbally,
But is arousable and following motor commands.
Excellent.
She is the perfect candidate for early ambulation.
You want to get her on her feet?
She just had surgery yesterday.
That's exactly the point.
Uh, new studies are showing
that if we get neuro patients up and moving
as soon as possible after surgery, they recover faster.
They have a greater return to function.
But the protocol is that we --
That is the great thing about being head of the department.
I decide what is and is not protocol.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh...Call Rachel's mother and suggest she not come in today.
It is gonna be a little rough.
Uh, Dr. Shepherd, sorry,
But Dr. Hunt said to round up all available interns.
Why? What's going on?
We're about to get hit with a silver flood.
I need fiber-optic intubation on standby for each bed.
What do we got?
Silver flood.
Okay, I need vitamin K, warm fluids,
blankets, and bair huggers.
Uh, what's a silver flood?
A silver flood is a fracture feast.
I need slings, splints, and pelvic binders,
As many as you can get your hands on.
Silver flood?
Silver flood.
Oh, and page every on-call x-ray tech.
Haven't seen one of these since Mercy West.
This will be fun.
Yes, but what is it exactly?
A silver flood is no regular day in the pit.
Patients might be agitated, angry, possibly even violent.
Use soothing tones, but do not speak too softly.
Do not administer unnecessary fluids.
If you see bruising, think bleeding.
No narcotics, no benzos.
Any questions?
Uh, y-yes, what is a silver flood?
I spent good money on that damn cruise,
and the shuttle bus crashed before we even reached the port.
Damn driver was fiddling with his phone the entire damn way.
So, he was -- he was texting?
Not on your life.
The way he was staring at that thing,
It had to be porno.
All right, call the O.R.,
tell them they need to have it ready for me yesterday.
Go!
Oh, silver flood.
Well, what did you think it was?
Why do you need a code word for a bunch of old people?
What? We're not old people.
We're senior citizens.
Disrespectful. Calling people old.
Who do you think you are?
I'm not old.
You don't know old.
You are rude.
That's why. Have fun with that.
I want to speak to your supervisor.
Thiazide for the blood pressure, metformin for my diabetes.
I also take another pill for my arthritis.
Great, so -- - I'm not done.
Also some kind of cholesterol pill and a baby aspirin.
That's it.
Eddie, are you sure you're not forgetting
some of the medications you might've been on,
Like, say for, I don't know, uh,
erectile dysfunction?
Do I look like the kind of guy
who needs to pop a pill to pop a woody?
Well, you know, I just got to ask.
'cause if -- if you were
on one of those meds and you didn't tell us,
then that could have a very bad reaction
based on any medications we might give you.
You could have a drop in blood pressure,
You could have a stroke, you could have a heart attack.
You need proof?
Watch this.
No! No, no, no!
That's okay.
That's -- please don't do that.
Mrs. Margraff, we are going to take you up to C.T.
And have you checked out, okay?
I'm not a Mrs., dear.
The gentleman and I are just shacking up.
H-how's my girl?
I'm fine, Abe.
Settle down.
Check his left hip.
He took a spill in February, hasn't been the same since.
Hasn't slowed him down, though.
Wait, look. D-don't bother with me.
Just make sure Gabby's all right.
These girls know what they're doing.
I-I-I'm just banged up is all.
Okay, so tell the nurses to monitor him
and keep him hydrated.
Abe, we are going to take Gabby up
and get her checked out, okay?
Okay. I-I'll be right here, Gabs, okay?
Will -- will you -- will you bring her back here?
Absolutely.
Take a nap, you old bastard!
Rachel, we just need to get you to the edge of the bed.
We get there, we can stop,
And I know it hurts, but you got to keep your eyes open.
Brody, hold her lines steady. Watch her I.V.
Come on. Just a little further.
Maybe we should stop?
Not yet.
We don't stop until we get her to the edge of the bed
or reach her point of intolerance.
Point of intolerance? How will we know?
Uh, i think that's pretty clear.
Okay. We're gonna let you relax now.
You did very, very well.
Let's get her cleaned up.
Stop.
I got it.
I'm gonna need you to take the lead
on Rachel bishop's next session.
Me?
Yeah, I have a full board, there's a silver flood,
and if we miss a session, we have to stop the treatment.
Well, would that really be so bad?
Do you have something you need to say?
I...
Don't think I'm comfortable with this course of treatment.
I see.
We are obviously pushing her way past
what she can handle right now, and I just feel --
Edwards.
This protocol is extremely difficult.
It feels traumatic.
But you have to look at it like surgery.
Surgery is traumatic.
It is so, so hard on the human body.
But in most cases, it is a patient's best chance to live,
to be normal again, to heal.
This is Rachel's chance to heal.
While she vomits.
Find me when you're done.
Portable x-ray tech to E.R.
Portable x-ray tech to e.R.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
Oh. It's Dr. Sweetheart. But what can I do for you?
Well, my lady friend, Gabby Margraff,
they said they were taking her for a P.T.
or something or -- or a p.P.?
A C.T.?
That's the ticket.
Oh, boy. You know, I haven't seen her since, but I-I --
and I-I-I-I-I don't want to be a bother,
but nobody's said anything.
Okay, well, hold on. Let me see.
Oh, yeah. Okay, so according to this, she's still in C.T.
Okay.
Oh, okay, good, good.
Great. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Y-you got jell-o here, right?
We do. Indeed.
Diaphragmatic contour is abnormal on the left.
It could be a rupture.
Any abdominal strain
and she could pop her guts right into her left lung.
I think there might be a splenic hematoma also,
but I won't know until I get in there.
Any way you can do it without a scar?
We'll do the best we can, Gabby, okay? You just sit tight.
Are you okay?
What's the matter?
Um, no, I'm having flashbacks.
Um...Sex flashbacks.
Hey, Wilson, would you step outside, please?
Okay, you were saying about the sex?
Meredith.
There was so much sex.
Hot, hot sex.
Everything hurts.
My back, my hip, the top of my head.
I feel like I'm 80.
Oh, my god. He's an intern.
Who does that?
Who screws the interns? What kind of person does that?
The father of my children.
Oh, Meredith.
Okay, I didn't mean -- you know I didn't mean -- I'm very sorry.
It's fine. Just relax.
You think you're the first person
to have inappropriate work sex?
We all do it all over the hospital.
I mean, we even did it in here once.
You know, i haven't thought about it.
Sex.
I haven't thought about it at all since...
That last morning --
The morning of the day he died.
I'm a widow.
Meredith, I'm so sorry.
We don't have to talk about this.
I'm -- I can't believe I even opened my stupid mouth.
Do you want me to get Alex or something?
I'm so sorry.
No, no.
It's -- it's -- I'm a widow.
I mean, like in the books and the movies.
You don't think that that happens, but it does.
It's just -- I'm closed for business.
Vagina city's a ghost town.
Orgasm train doesn't roll through here anymore.
That part of my life is over.
You know, eventually, you'll -- when you're ready --
No. I don't want to.
It's fine.
I'm okay. I'm good.
So, tell me about the hot, hot sex with the hot intern
and how he did you sideways
because I am widow Grey, dead inside.
Honey, no.
That is the saddest story I've ever heard.
Gabby.
Honey, you're breaking my heart.
The orgasm train should never stop running.
I've had an orgasm every day since I was 15.
Well, when I was 15, I was scrapbooking with my mom.
We had nine different kinds of glitter.
Now, see, that is hot to me.
Orgasms are wonderful.
I had two this morning before we got on the bus.
How long has he been down?
10 minutes.
I ran through the acls v-fib protocol twice.
Okay, charge to 200.
What happened?
He was having chest pains, so I gave him some nitro.
His B.P. bottomed out all at once.
I'm worried he was on E.D. Meds. We asked him.
Well, was he? Clear!
What happened?
He insisted he wasn't.
We asked him several times. We told him what could happen.
Clear!
He probably lied.
Why would he do that when we told him?
People can be stubborn,
even when it's the worst thing for them.
We told him.
Time of death 12:19.
What do...
What do we do now?
You notify the morgue.
That's it?
That's it.
Excuse me. Can you help me?
They said my father was in the accident.
Can you tell me where I can find him?
What's his name?
Edward Squire. Eddie.
He only answers to Eddie.
Uh...Okay.
I...I should, uh -- you know, I'm gonna --
Let's find someone who can talk to you --
What? Why?
Is he hurt?
He, um...I'm really sorry, but I don't think I should be --
Just tell me.
He h-had a heart attack.
Is he -- is he all right? Can you take me to him?
I-I can't. I can't.
What do you mean you can't? Just tell me where he is.
Your father's -- he...
He passed away.
What?
We think he lied about the medication he was taking.
What are you talking about? He's dead?
My father is dead?
Please just come with me.
And we can find someone who can -- - Don't you touch me!
Sir, sir.
He said my father was dead, and he won't tell me where he is!
I am so sorry.
He said my dad was a liar.
Sir, come sit down.
I'm gonna tell you everything that happened
and I will take you to your dad, okay?
Okay. Please, please.
Get him a chair and bring him some water.
Right.
Thank you. That was --
What did you do? What did you say to him?
Dr. Hunt, I -- - What the hell did you say?!
I thought the point of a singles cruise
was to meet other singles.
Exactly.
Where do you think I met Gabby?
Five years ago almost to the day.
Really?
Absotively.
i didn't even want to go.
But my sister wouldn't get off my back.
"Go out, meet people.
Don't just sit at home in that chair."
Mm-hmm. It's a nice chair?
The best.
Oh, you press a button and your feet go up.
And there's a -- there's a warmer in the seat.
And -- and -- and a little cubby for the remote.
Sounds like a dream.
Now I'm living a new dream.
I got the chair. I got the girl.
Here, but let me show you something.
Oh, Abe, this is all too sudden.
I barely know you. I just met you.
â€­You know, you're a wise ass.
But I -- but I like that.
It's beautiful.
Gabby's beautiful.
I was gonna propose on the boat.
On the third night,
there's this big dance in the main dining room.
Huge ice sculptures and a dance band and everything.
That's where I first saw her.
The dress she was wearing.
I got so dizzy, i-I just had to sit down.
I closed my eyes for a second, and when I opened them --
Oh, gosh dang it.
Abe, I'm so sorry. Duty calls.
Oh, you kidding? Go.
You got more important things to do
than to listen to my stories.
I am getting the rest of that story.
I will be back A.S.A.P.
Bring another jell-o with you.
Oh, okay. Um, wait, hold on.
Raspberry or lime?
Surprise me.
Okay.
Okay, Gabby, we're going to put you under now, okay?
I need to tell Abe.
Abe is downstairs.
We're gonna tell him everything that's going on.
No, I need to tell him.
He'll crap his pants if he thinks I'm in trouble.
I can grab an intern to --
Bless his heart, he may actually crap his pants.
He's 90.
Okay, the sats are down to 87.
Gabby, I'm gonna need you to take some deep breaths.
Let's get her under right now.
Wilson, go down and find someone to tell Abe
that Gabby's in surgery and she is just fine.
I was gonna scrub in.
Wilson, we have enough hands here.
Go cover the pit.
You'll see him when you wake up.
Listen, Rachel, I know this is hard,
but this is how you're gonna heal.
Okay?
Here we go.
All right, let's try for a step, Rachel.
Can you give me a step?
One step.
You give me a step, you get in that chair, we can stop.
Step, the chair, we stop.
It's okay.
Come on. We got you.
You can do it. It's okay.
Come on. Step, chair, stop.
It's okay.
I got you.
Step, chair, stop.
That's enough. That's enough for now.
Put her down.
Dr. Edwards?
That's okay. That's good, Rachel.
That's really good.
Let's get you back to bed. Let's get her in bed.
We haven't reached her point of intolerance.
Dr. Shep--
I said we're done.
Okay.
Legs.
You did so good.
You did really good.
Really good, okay?
Want to go grab some food with me?
I have no appetite.
Shepherd's making me torture a patient
who just had brain surgery.
Because she likes you.
Got a funny way of showing it.
At least she let's you torture a patient.
Grey and Pierce just threw me out of the O.R.
They hate me.
You know, I need to be more like you.
You make the system your bitch.
If I could get an attending to look at me
the way that Shepherd looks at you...
Okay, Rachel, Dr. Edwards said
that we just need to get you into this chair,
so that's what we're gonna do.
All right.
Okay. Ready?
Wilson?
A word, please?
I'll be back.
Dr. Shepherd,
I was just about to get Rachel on her feet.
Where the hell is Edwards?
There were 40 passengers on the bus.
Eight of them died en route.
We've lost six in the E.R. already,
and many more are in surgery
or in critical care in the I.C.U.
All of these peoples' families
are on their way to this hospital right now.
When they get here,
you will be responsible for informing them
that their loved ones have died.
â€­What?
Why us?
Because after what I've seen today,
you clearly need the practice.
Now, there are four steps to this.
Location, language, body language, and leave.
We think of them as the four l's.
The first "L" -- location.
Bring them to a quiet, comfortable place
where they won't be disturbed.
Looking for the family of Nestor Rodriguez.
Family of Emma Pritchett?
June Napali?
That's me.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Just a minute.
Okay, here, let me --
Get your damn hands off me. I can do it.
Next, language.
We used all our capabilities.
Don't sugarcoat it.
Don't leave anything open to interpretation.
Unfortunately, we were unable to resuscitate him.
And despite our best efforts...
You have to use the word "Died."
Franklin is no longer with us.
Grandpa left? Where'd he go?
What?
Can we go there?
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
That's not what I --
Are you going to take us there now?
Third, body language.
Often a comforting touch can help.
A hand on the arm or on the shoulder...
...If it feels appropriate.
Grandpa's in heaven now, sweetie, with your turtle.
Why are you still here?
And finally, leave as soon as you're able.
You've done what you came to do, so excuse yourself.
Get out.
You know what?
We're just gonna do this here.
Abraham.
Hey, who was monitoring this man?
I checked him five minutes ago.
He was fine.
Oh, Abe.
I cannot fathom what possessed you
to abandon your pa-- my patient.
Dr. Shepherd -- - Why are you talking?
No one is talking to you.
You, speak.
I did not abandon her. Dr. Wilson is an excellent --
I didn't choose Wil-- I chose you.
I gave you specific instructions.
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry. I couldn't put Rachel through that.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Edwards, why?
There has to be a good reason why,
because you are too smart for this.
So, tell me.
Look...
When I was a kid,
I was in a clinical trial for sickle cell anemia.
What?
I was 5.
They held me down, the nurses and the doctors,
sticking me with needles and taking my bone marrow.
You can't imagine the pain.
And my mom would be saying over and over,
"Honey, it's for your own good. It's for your own good."
I screamed and I kicked and I fought,
and so sometimes they would strap me to the table,
which they were right to do.
For my own good.
I was 5.
I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do,
for something that was inside of me.
And I'm not gonna do that to somebody else.
I'm sorry.
I can't. I won't.
Hey, Hunt,I need to find a patient -- Gabby Margraff.
Oh, she's in surgery with Grey and Pierce.
What do you need?
I need to tell her
her boyfriend's dead.
He coded in the hallway.
Well, how did he --
I mean, he's 90.
Could've been a stroke or an M.I.
He just fell asleep and --
Robbins, I'm sorry.
We'll take care of it, okay?
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh, god.
What happened?
Nothing.
Nothing. I'm fine.
What happened?
I don't know. I don't even know why I'm crying.
He wasn't -- he wasn't even my patient.
He wasn't even a-a baby.
He was 90.
Who was 90?
Abe.
He was...In love.
He met the love of his life when he was 85,
and he was gonna propose to her.
But he died.
I'm sorry.
God, I felt like I could talk to him forever.
He made me feel like --
You know, I-I never really believed
that I'd find love again.
Not anything real or true.
I thought that I had it and I screwed it up,
And that was over.
Then he was madly in love at 85,
and that is proof that there is --
There is more love out there.
Callie might've found hers and I can find mine,
even if it's in 60 years.
I don't want to find a new soul mate
when I'm 90!
I met mine already and he wants a divorce.
Aww, sweetie.
This is about me.
This isn't about you.
Sorry.
What the hell was that?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for you to get thrown under the bus like that.
I don't care about that.
How could you make up a story like that?
What?
Working the system is one thing.
You want to tell a little lie to get your labs run faster, great.
I-I'm on board.
But that, what you did in there,
The violin you played for Dr. Shepherd, you can't do that.
You can't manipulate someone like that.
You crossed a line.
Don't you even have a conscience?
Well, it worked, so maybe I'm better off without one.
I owe you an apology.
I...You were helping out a friend.
I overreacted.
Don't worry about it.
If I'd known about Edwards,
I would've approached the whole thing differently.
We're --
We're having this thing at the house tonight.
You two should come.
There's gonna be food, booze.
She could probably use it.
Dr. Shepherd.
Yeah?
Stephanie's a liar.
She was never sick.
She made the whole thing up.
Check the drains for blood every two hours
and page me when she's awake.
Okay.
I'm gonna go let Abe know.
Oh, okay. Oh, my god. He's here.
What? Who?
He's here.
He's here, and he's hot. Oh, my god. Help me.
Save me. Help.
Dr. Pierce?
What does he want?
What do you want?
Is that your patient, Gabby Margraff?
Why?
Why?
I'm supposed to notify her that her husband's died.
They -- they were not married.
They were just shacking up.
Okay, but he --
He put her down as next of kin on his forms, so --
W-why are you -- you are an intern.
Give me that.
Yeah, she's not your patient.
This isn't your job. Who sent you up here?
Dr. Hunt ordered me. It's a teaching thing.
I know the four l's.
You know what?
Stop talking. Four l's?
She's not even your patient. Don't touch her!
Don't go near her! I'll deal with Hunt!
Geez, what's her problem?
It's not like I want to be doing this.
Her problem is that there are rules
and...boundaries.
And some people think that you can just ignore all those rules,
that you can cross those boundaries,
that just because protocol is broken once in a whi--
No, no, no.
Once!
Once.
That the rules go out the window, but they don't, okay?
Her problem is that hot people should know
tThat just because a person does something that is reckless
and likes it
does not mean that they are going to
keep doing that thing, okay?
Her problem is that maybe she is tired of
scrapbooking and glitter,
but she does not know who she is anymore,
and everyone needs to just give her the space to figure it out
and stop asking her questions
and talking about jumbo condoms.
That...
is Meredith's problem.
Understand?
Yeah, I think that -- - Okay, good.
Great.
Dr. Shepherd, I promise you --
I've heard enough.
Dr. Shepherd.
Grey tell you that I subbed in for her class this morning?
And I think I did the neuro department proud.
Dr. Webber, as residency directory,
You should know...
...Dr. Edwards abandoned a patient this afternoon,
and when questioned about it, she lied to my face.
A truly offensive lie about being sick as a kid,
and I bought it.
I...
I believed you.
She told me -- - Dr. Shepherd.
What do you want me to do here?
She doesn't believe me on her own.
When she applied to this program,
I got a call from Keith Wagner at Saint Jude's.
That sickle cell trial was a milestone in his career.
Wanted to tell me how proud he was of her
and how lucky we'd be to have her.
Hers was one of the few success stories
to come out of that trial.
I don't understand why Wilson told me you lied.
Because Wilson doesn't know.
because I don't talk about it anymore,
because I'm not a patient anymore.
I am a surgeon.
And when I do talk about it, I only tell people I can trust.
Why didn't she just --
Why didn't she just tell me to confirm the story with you?
Why did she let me -- god.
How many hours?
How many days?
How many surgeries have you spent with Edwards?
She's been your right hand.
So why was it so easy to question her integrity
based on the word of a doctor you hardly knew?
God.
Okay.
Keep him in N.P.O.
Hunt.
What the hell is going on?
Sorry?
I have an intern who says
you sent him upstairs to tell my patient --
I did. I'm giving them a crash course in breaking bad news.
They need it.
Oh, a crash course.
Is that how this goes? No, it's not how this goes.
That is not how this works.
Grey, this is a teaching hospital.
We teach from experience.
Now, I've given them the four l's --
The four l's are not enough.
These interns, they need a lot more.
Of course they need more. That's why they have to do it.
They have to...
experience it.
They have to live it.
And to learn it, they have to be up close and personal with it.
When you walk into a room
to tell someone that their loved one has died,
it's more than just a list of bullet points you've memorized.
Yours is the face they will remember
for the rest of their life.
They were fine before they met you.
They picked up their children from school,
they made dinner, and they got a call.
The police showed up at their door and brought them here
with those children to this room
so that you can give them the worst news of their entire life.
You are changing this person's life forever.
You are responsible for this moment.
For the instant that person
goes from wife to widow is you.
All you. Nobody but you.
So, this person isn't an inconvenience.
They are not a box on a list to be checked off.
You are a part of their life now.
Your words, your face.
So take that seriously
and recognize the importance of your role.
And respect the fact that that person's pain
is the biggest thing in the room.
You got it?
It's not closed forever, right?
The orgasm train will chug into the station again.
It just...
I'm just not wondering what's out there.
Not feeling like I'm missing anything.
I've had that great, amazing love.
And that part's behind me now,
and I have the kids and you guys and surgery, and...
...I'm happy.
And I never thought I would be again and I am.
And that's all I need.
So, you just need to watch those lines just like before.
Good, good.
Okay.
There you go.
There you go.
Okay.
I know this sucks.
But we're gonna get you in that chair, okay?
Okay.
Go on. Keep hitting me.
Keep hitting me. We're almost there.
Keep hitting me. Focus on that.
Focus on that.
You don't stop now until we get you into this chair.
Come on. You're almost there, Rachel.
Come on.
Keep going.
I know. You're almost there.
You're almost there.
Come on.
Come on, Rachel. Just one step.
There you go.
Okay. Good. Good.
Good job, Rachel. You did good.
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
You did it.
I need to step out for just a moment.
You did good.
You did it. Good job.
That was excellent.
You saw?
I did.
Very, very well done.
Thank you
I'm sorry... that I didn't believe you.
I should have.
Thank you.
Wait, aren't you supposed to be throwing a party right now?
Crap.
Deluca.
Hey, look, I'm -- I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to cross boundaries or not do my job,
and I clearly pissed you off and Dr. Grey.
So I'm sorry, and if it's about last night, I'm --
Okay.
Actually, I was -- I was coming to apologize to you.
That yelling was not about today.
It was about last night.
Yeah, I knew that.
Right, well, um...
Last night is not going to happen again.
It was very nice.
Was better than nice.
But...I don't do this.
Hey, look, I don't -- I don't do this, either, okay?
I don't. But at the bar, you were just so --
You were so-- also.
And, uh...You're -- you're very...
Thank you. Uh, so are you.
So, uh, it was -- it was a slip.
Right. I get it.
And, uh, you know what? I agree.
Okay, it -- it never happened.
Deleted.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There are some things in life that simply can't be avoided.
No matter how uncomfortable they make us,
and there can be rewards in
stepping outside of your comfort zone.
Even when the thought of it makes us want to puke.
No,, those are for the guests.
Yeah, we came early to eat the best part.
Hey, where's Maggie?
She was supposed to be here with the ice
and people are already showing up.
Maggie got held up at work. She said she's on her way.
The dryer finished a little bit early,
but the tablecloth's still damp.
It's fine. Just put it on the table.
It's fine.
Okay.
Even when we want nothing more
than to run screaming for the hills.
oh, is that Jackson?
No, it's Callie.
Oh, god.
I didn't know her new girlfriend was a redhead.
Oh, no. I-I need more liquor. I'm not ready.
I'll get it.
That's why people like to say
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Welcome.
Hi, Meredith. This is Penny.
The call to not get a head C.T. Was a bad call.
I'm so sorry.
It was my job to save him and I failed.
Honey, this is Meredith.
But I brought some wine.
But sometimes...
I'm so sorry.
...Those people don't know what the hell they're talking about.
