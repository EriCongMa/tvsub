of all the indignities of middle school ,
nothing was worse than the soul @-@ crushing humiliation
of being forced to swim in gym class ...
all right , swimmers , let &apos;s have some fun !
... the sickening smell of chlorine , the thick , humid air ,
having to be shirtless in front of your class
while you were at your most gawky and awkward .
and it was worse for the girls .
they would have to parade in front of us
at the most self @-@ conscious time in their lives .
please don &apos;t look at me . please don &apos;t look at me . please don &apos;t look at me !
yep , you dreaded it all year
until , at last , it was unavoidable .
or ... was it ?
goldfarb . no suit , again , i see .
what is it this time ?
i have a contagious butt rash .
i hated swimming so much ,
i would try pretty much anything to get out of it .
swimming is against my religion .
i &apos;m allergic to water .
i have an irritable bowel .
i got one heck of a fungus downstairs .
yep , i had beaten the system .
adam is failing gym class .
or so i thought .
i &apos;d say the failing is yours , but continue .
your son comes in every day with a new excuse
for why he can &apos;t swim .
if my schmoops says he can &apos;t swim ,
then he must have a legitimate reason ,
and i fully support him .
so , you can vouch for your son &apos;s claim
that he can &apos;t get into the pool
because he &apos;s a c.i.a. operative wearing a wire ?
that &apos;s classified .
i think i can shed some light on what &apos;s going on here .
wow . please do .
your boy is self @-@ conscious because of his wig .
he doesn &apos;t wear a wig .
well , i &apos;m stumped .
but you better figure something out ,
because an &quot; f &quot; in gym means adam will never
get to be a physical educator later in life .
oh , no .
he &apos;ll also have to repeat the 8th grade .
oh , no !
yeah , probably should &apos;ve led with that .
it was october 14 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and erica was doing what she did every day --
hanging with the cool kids .
this one &apos;s shiny , and this one &apos;s thermal .
this one &apos;s flannel .
this one &apos;s denim .
ooh , that &apos;s super @-@ rare .
oh ... my god .
we are smart , ambitious women ,
and we &apos;re talking about scrunchies .
is this really the best that we can do in our lives ?
ooh , wait . i &apos;ve got something .
no . it &apos;s also about scrunchies .
but lately she had been finding hanging with the cool kids
a little less fulfilling .
luckily , her search for meaning came to an end
when she saw one iconic video --
&quot; we are the world , &quot; an epic song for charity
that brought together all america &apos;s biggest music legends .
and for erica , it was about to give her shallow life meaning .
look -- kenny rogers and kenny loggins !
that &apos;s the two best kennys in one room -- unheard of .
you &apos;re right . if they can make a difference , so can i.
this changes everything .
attention , everyone .
after some careful reflection ,
i am devoting myself to changing the world .
good for you , sweetheart .
that &apos;s very selfless and admirable .
yeah , that &apos;s great . poser .
excuse me ?
oh , i was just agreeing with pops .
poser .
you take it back right now .
poser !
i am not a poser .
p @-@ p @-@ p @-@ poser , poser , p @-@ p @-@ poser .
stop it .
stop .
poser .
shut up !
back then , &quot; poser &quot; was the worst name you could call someone .
it meant you were a fake , a phony ,
or wearing the t @-@ shirt of a band you knew nothing about .
poser .
i am not a poser .
social awareness is super @-@ important to me .
i even got principal ball to start
a social awareness club at school .
aw . it &apos;s just like when we saw that &quot; we are the earth &quot; song .
you got inspired by music ?
i am not a poser , okay ?
you &apos;re the one who pretends to be a rapper
and a ka @-@ ra @-@ te master .
i don &apos;t pretend anything .
at my core , i &apos;m a break @-@ dancing samurai ninja
who spits mad rhymes and dunks mad jams .
that &apos;s just a smorgasbord of absurd things
mashed together in one ridiculous human .
you want to know what &apos;s ridiculous ?
that you think people would actually care about
your dumb social awareness club ,
especially one started by a poser .
you &apos; re a poser !
copied my insult -- ergo , you &apos;re a poser !
logic ! barry wins !
you did not ! erica wins !
no , he won . you copied him .
it was weak , sweetheart .
have a slice of pizza and be happy .
while barry was tearing down erica &apos;s idea ,
my mom was about to try to build me up .
why don &apos;t we try to get the chief
in a good mood for a change ?
nell carter looks like she gives great hugs .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
no !
guess who just had a meeting with coach mellor .
apparently , adam is failing .
i don &apos;t get it . you used to love to swim .
but i figured it out .
really ?
yeah . it &apos;s your bathing suit .
you &apos;re growing fast ,
and it &apos;s pinching your little coin purse .
that &apos;s why i got you these jams --
nice roomy swim trunks for all your bits and berries .
go on . model them for mama .
i don &apos;t want to model the jams .
come on . they &apos;re jams .
i know they &apos;re jams .
well , then show us how handsome you look in your new jams .
i don &apos;t want the jams .
come on . they &apos;re jams .
he doesn &apos;t want the damn jams ! leave the boy alone already !
well , someone has to address the issue with his little marbles .
nobody wants their mom talking about their yam bag .
my god ! the problem isn &apos;t the swimsuit .
it &apos;s just -- i hate taking off my shirt .
why ?
i &apos;m ashamed of my body . okay ?
you &apos;re ashamed ?
of this beautiful wall of deliciousness ?
those words make it so much worse .
i &apos;m never swimming again .
even if george lucas invited me to a pool party
in the swamps of dagobah , i &apos;d still say no .
i mean , i &apos;d go and check it out .
how many chances do you have to meet yoda ?
but i would not go into the pool .
my mom hoped she could save me .
meanwhile , my sister was saving the world .
what &apos;s all this about ?
it &apos;s the first meeting of the social awareness club .
erica &apos;s dumb thing ?
but it &apos;s packed -- and with cool kids .
how &apos;s this possible ?
and that &apos;s when i decided that i had to change the world .
wait , she &apos;s getting interviewed by the william penn mirror ?
come on -- don &apos;t get all jealous
&apos;cause your sister &apos;s making news .
and me eating 32 fish sticks in the cafeteria isn &apos;t ?
this is classic media bias !
please tell me the paper is writing an article about
how you &apos;re the biggest poser in school .
no , because i &apos;m not a poser .
but i did tell them that you were one , poser .
easy on the p @-@ word , huh ?
what is this , a disco ?
i really love my community and want to give back ,
but erica won &apos;t let me .
please ! he &apos;s joining so that he can ruin my club from the inside .
you know , i think the mirror might be interested to know
that a social awareness club discriminates .
what are you writing ?
we don &apos;t discriminate .
barry is welcome , of course .
you can quote me on that .
okay , moving on to our first fundraiser --
i was thinking that a song could inspire people ,
kind of like &quot; we are the world . &quot;
i think that we focus on one issue
that &apos;s super @-@ important today -- helping the people of africa .
question .
what ? !
why do you get to pick the issue ?
because it &apos;s the most important one .
to you , but what about the rainforest
or raising awareness for the ozone
or why air jordans are so expensive ?
air jordans ? that &apos;s not even a cause .
you know , i think the mirror might be interested to know
a social awareness club is run by a dictator .
no , just put barry &apos;s ideas in your song , erica .
say , does anyone else have an issue to be made aware of ?
perhaps my wonderful girlfriend has a few .
now that i think of it ,
there are , like , way too many nuclear weapons .
ooh ! that &apos;s a good one . put it down .
yeah , but nuclear energy
is cleaner than burning fossil fuels .
that &apos;s true . so write &quot; yes , nukes . &quot;
but i just wrote down &quot; no nukes . &quot;
who else has a cause ? don &apos;t be shy .
save the wales , bro . gotta do it .
except the killer wales .
they &apos;re bad , &apos; cause they &apos;re killers .
so , i guess save some wales ?
that makes no sense .
write it down ! come on ! shout it out !
there are no bad ideas .
poverty !
scrunchies !
our town needs a bennigan &apos;s !
spay and neuter. politics . acid rain .
as erica was beginning to realize she had a problem ,
my mom was trying to solve mine .
what &apos;s shakin &apos; , bacon ?
you up for a little chat about -- oh , i don &apos;t know --
&quot; star wars , &quot; robots , your body , video games ?
please , just go away .
okay , not until you look at yourself in the mirror .
come on .
drink it all in .
now say &quot; i have a beautiful body . &quot;
yeah , not gonna happen .
oh , it will .
look in the mirror and tell that beautiful body
just how beautiful it is .
you need to leave .
say it .
no !
say &quot; i have a beautiful body . &quot;
never !
let me show you how it &apos;s done .
i like my eyes &apos; cause they sparkle .
i like my shoulders &apos; cause they look good with or without pads .
i like my tummy &apos; cause it &apos;s where i baked you .
make it stop !
wait ! my little angel &apos;s a 10 !
you are a 10 !
you &apos;re a 10 !
after that debacle , i needed a laugh , so i turned to
the funniest movie about a dancing gopher ever made --
&quot; caddyshack . &quot;
but instead of cracking me up , it gave me an idea .
i couldn &apos;t be expected to swim
if the pool was suddenly shut down .
those poor schmucks think someone had an accident ,
but it &apos;s just a candy bar !
this movie is a hoot !
things are just getting good . where you going , kiddo ?
i suddenly got a craving for a baby ruth .
at 6 : 49 this morning , our faithful janitor
discovered a foreign object in the pool .
initially , we thought the object was ...
organic in nature ,
so we followed school protocol and drained the facilities .
upon closer inspection , we determined
that the floater in question was , in fact , a candy bar .
laugh it up , chuckleheads ,
but caddy shacking a pool is a serious offense .
i said no press !
damn it .
now this is gonna be all over the mirror .
my plan had worked .
the question was , how long could i get away with it ?
don &apos;t want a nuclear winter
that &apos;s why we need a nuclear freeze
i know that &apos;s confusing --
god . what the hell rhymes with &quot; freeze &quot; ?
did someone say &quot; barry &quot; ?
get out !
because of you , i have to write a ridiculous song
about every issue in the world .
chill , girl .
big tasty &apos;s got the answer to all your problems .
merch .
go away !
just hear me out .
songs are cute , but if you want to start making real cheddar ,
merch is where it &apos;s at .
why are you still here ?
did you know the rolling stones make 93 % of their money
on t @-@ shirts ?
and the other 22 % ?
stickers !
merch , baby ! merch !
i &apos;m not doing a thing you say .
bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup .
reserve your judgment until you see the back .
are you kidding me ? !
your merch is all about getting you sneakers .
exactly !
you see , at first , i thought you were just some dumb poser ,
but then i realized your dumb poser crap
can help get me my air jordans .
that &apos;s it ! i don &apos;t care what the principal says .
you &apos;re out of my club .
you can &apos;t do that !
i just did .
the mirror &apos;s gonna have a field day with you , poser .
call me &quot; poser &quot; all you want . i don &apos;t care anymore .
in fact , you are worse than a poser .
all you are is a joke .
oh , we &apos;ll see who the joke is
once i start my own rival social awareness club
to raise money for barity .
barity ? that &apos;s not a thing .
it &apos;s a barry charity -- a barity .
and it will crush your charity .
wha--
stop !
barry !
stop it !
all right , listen up .
i figured keeping you here hours after class
would flush out our prankster .
alvin , our janitor , gave me that pun .
if the culprit doesn &apos;t come forward by next class ,
you will all be punished !
but know this -- i will find you .
my time was running out ,
so my only option was to create confusion .
whoever did this , stop being a putz and just admit it .
honestly , dude , we were all kind of thinking it was you .
guys , it can &apos;t be me . that would be too obvious .
it &apos;s always the last person that you suspect .
don &apos;t nod at me .
everyone knows dave kim &apos;s allergic to nuts .
and how do you just happen to know that candy bar had nuts ?
they all have nuts !
not milky way . that &apos;s nougat .
nougat is nuts !
you &apos;re making that up .
the primary ingredients in nougat are
sugar , nuts , and egg whites .
like a criminal mastermind , i had created confusion ,
and it was glorious .
but erica was about to create confusion of a different kind .
hey , lainey .
yeah , erica ?
when did the earth die ?
today .
unless you open your eyes and your wallets .
uno , dos , tres ...
cuatro .
listen up , america , let &apos;s get socially aware
stop thinkin &apos; about yourself
your clothes , your grades , your hair
stop the nukes and pollution
acid rain is not our friend
save the whales , the ozone
and we &apos;d love to get a bennigan &apos;s
we &apos;ll fix the world
yes , every problem
there &apos;s way too many on this list
but we will solve them
we want a two @-@ day school week
and lando calrissian for president
and relax the school &apos;s policy on nudity
and i want a date with erica
geoff , stop changing the words .
no , acid rain , yes , recycling
but no more death penalty
unless the guy really deserves it
then zap him , i &apos;d agree
or her
&apos;cause we &apos;re for equal rights , as well @-@ el @-@ el @-@ ellllll
we &apos;ll fix the world
yes , every problem
no matter how dumb they are
yes , we will solve them
guys . guys , they &apos;re leaving .
wai-- what ? wait , stop ! we have 10 more verses !
doughnuts !
charitable doughnuts for sale !
what the --
don &apos;t be shy . all doughnuts go to barity .
what the hell is this ?
victory . my friend terrance , he works at the wawa .
he gave me all the day @-@ old doughnuts they were gonna trash .
you people are eating garbage pastries .
why don &apos;t you write a song about it , bob dylan ?
one glazed , please .
this isn &apos;t a charity . it &apos;s exchanging money for goods .
it &apos;s a business .
you &apos;re just jealous , &apos; cause i &apos;m changing the world
one doughnut at a time .
fine . i give up .
so you admit it .
you &apos;re the poser , not me .
i just wanted to do something important ,
but i guess you were right .
no one cares , and no matter how hard i try ,
i &apos;ll never make a difference .
two days !
it &apos;s been two long , swimless days ,
and our prankster still hasn &apos;t admitted
to caddyshacking the pool .
until our culprit comes forward ,
you will all run laps every day , all period long .
mirsky .
so , you &apos;re saying we run laps instead of swimming ?
that &apos;s right .
nice !
wait , hold on . stop , stop , stop .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;d rather run laps indefinitely
than get in the pool ?
yeah .
that &apos;s good .
well , in that case ...
swimming for the rest of the year !
we can &apos;t just swim all year . what about basketball ?
it &apos;ll be water basketball .
dodgeball ?
pool dodgeball .
crab soccer ?
you &apos;ll be on rafts .
for the love of god ,
whoever did this , just admit it .
okay , fine . i know who did it .
the other day after class , adam ...
... made us realize it was dave kim .
what ? !
i didn &apos;t see that coming .
dave kim , my office .
it &apos;s a setup ! it couldn &apos;t have been me !
nougat is nuts .
the primary ingredient is nuts .
maybe we &apos;re being a little hasty .
you can &apos;t protect him now , goldfarb .
he made his choice .
not so funny now , are you , candyman ?
&quot; caddyshame &quot; ?
dave kim is guilty ?
i cannot believe this .
everybody knows dave kim is allergic to nuts ,
and nougat is nuts .
no , this has adam written all over it .
we &apos;ve watched that movie a million times .
no ! adam wouldn &apos;t do that .
i solved his problems by forcing him to love his body .
nobody wants to hear that sort of thing from their mother .
well , if that &apos;s true ,
then i suppose he needs to hear it from his father .
or his grandfather .
i &apos;m not saying that weird stuff to the boy .
we keep it loose .
murray , you need to do this !
now go up there and tell him he has a beautiful body
before he believes he doesn &apos;t .
and so my dad set off to tell me i had a beautiful body .
hey . uh ... how you doing ?
why are you in my room ?
just came by to say &quot; hi &quot; and
what ?
to tell you yougotabeautifulbody .
what ?
you know , thatyougotabeautifulbody .
see , y @-@ y @-@ you keep trailing off , specifically at the end .
you got a beautiful body .
this body of yours -- beautiful !
don &apos;t ever tell me that again !
deal .
but ...
let &apos;s be truthful .
you don &apos;t have a beautiful body .
thanks .
you &apos;re in middle school .
your body -- it &apos;s stinky and greasy
and it &apos;s growing too fast .
and when you talk , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s like a ...
a broken kazoo .
those days were horrible .
i @-@ i @-@ i remember them . i really do .
since when have you had a shred of insecurity about your body ?
you &apos;ll go anywhere in your tighty @-@ whities .
that &apos;s now .
when i was your age , i hated my body .
the good news is , i grew up ,
and life beat me down so hard
that i eventually stopped caring .
and someday , life will crap on you so hard
that you &apos;ll stop caring , too !
that &apos;s ... oddly comforting .
trust me .
eventually , you &apos;ll realize
it doesn &apos;t matter what other people think .
thanks to my dad , i knew i had to take a stand .
all right , everybody , settle in .
gonna watch this jokester do laps for the next hour .
anything you &apos;d like to say
before you begin your aquatic odyssey ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
it was time to be a man
and take responsibility for what i &apos;d done .
wait .
i did it . i caddy shacked the pool .
innocent !
look , this wasn &apos;t some prank .
i did it because i hate swimming .
we all do .
we dread having to wear our swimsuits in front of each other
because we feel super @-@ weird about our super @-@ weird bodies .
so if it &apos;s a crime to be self @-@ conscious ,
then i guess i &apos;m guilty .
but just ask yourself --
isn &apos;t that punishment enough ?
no .
a month &apos;s detention .
balls .
as for the rest of you ...
is he right ?
yeah .
all right , look .
i know not everyone is in peak physical condition ,
like coach .
a lot of you got baby fat .
some of you are gangly , spaghetti @-@ armed monsters .
others just look like a sack of paste .
but if this is how you feel , then i am willing
to make even the worst of you a little more comfortable .
that &apos;s the crazy thing about growing up --
help comes when you least expect it ...
from the people you expect the least from .
what &apos;s this ?
consider it a baritable donation
to your social whatever club .
but this is your air jordan money .
why would you give this to me ?
look , maybe you are a poser , but so am i.
don &apos;t tell anyone , but i can &apos;t dunk on charles barkley .
i &apos;m not in the yakuza .
and even though it looks like it ,
my body &apos;s not as cut as ll cool j &apos;s .
well , your secret &apos;s safe with me .
so , we &apos;re both posers , and so are all our friends .
i guess we &apos;re all just trying to figure it out .
but the one thing i do know --
you will definitely make a difference .
thanks , barry . thank you .
when we &apos;re young ,
we &apos;re all just trying to figure out who we are .
donate to make a change , people .
if it &apos;s an issue you care about , it &apos;s on this shirt .
and sometimes other people see our potential before we do .
poopie . you like the jams .
i thought maybe i &apos;d wear them to swim class .
and even though it &apos;s scary to not know where you &apos;re going ,
with people who love you , you know you &apos;ll be okay .
i made him feel beautiful .
you sure did , bev .
at times , you &apos;ll struggle to be comfortable in your own skin ,
but if you look around ,
you &apos;ll find you &apos;re in pretty great company .
crazy awesome news --
my barity is back in full effect .
dear god .
how do you keep making these t @-@ shirts so fast ?
mom &apos;s got iron @-@ on decals of all our faces .
check mine out .
no , take it off !
focus !
i wanted to let you know i took a page out of your book ,
wrote a dope song to raise money for a good cause .
kick it , jtp .
poverty , pollution , the world ain &apos;t fair
what this planet needs is clean water and air
jordans !
stop , stop , stop !
that was amazing , and you definitely need to do it
in front of the whole school .
yes . philanthropy , barry wins !
