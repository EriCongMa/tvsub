max , thanks for agreeing to get in the spirit
and do holiday cupcakes .

christmas is like herpes .
no matter what you do ,
it &apos;s gonna flare up once a year .
oh , you made feliz navidad cupcake .
i &apos;m muy proud of you .
and i think we &apos;re going to make muy mucho moolah
when manuel comes manana .
you &apos;re the only person i know
who seems whiter speaking spanish .
feliz navidad for our spanish speaking friends .
and for kids raised like me , feliz &quot; he &apos;s @-@ not @-@ your @-@ dad . &quot;
and then , &quot; joy to the world &quot; for the normals ,
and for the hipsters , &quot; joint to the world . &quot;
for the kids , &quot; frosty the snowman . &quot;
and for you , &quot; frosty with no man . &quot;

冬日天寒地冻与冻伤就是他造成的

a phrase i heard from both my ex @-@ wives .
wow , you have more christmas cards
than oscar pistorius had excuses .
13年枪杀女友案上庭时借口很多
what can i say , max ? i spread a lot of goodwill .
it &apos;s also where i get all of my shirts .
here you go . have a nice holiday .
my two kids love this time of year .
and next christmas , there will be three .
it &apos;s a boy .
my husband was so happy when i called him in afghanistan .
man , this time of year people are easier
than a fat girl in a tube top .
oh , great . we can use this money
to order more of our cupcake t @-@ shirts .
no , we are using that to buy people christmas gifts .
i was really looking forward to giving someone something
that wouldn &apos;t require the follow @-@ up penicillin shot .
we need more shirts . these are really selling .
the guy at table four said it &apos;s the perfect gift
for a girl you &apos;re not in love with , just strictly banging .
he bought three .
i happen to know for a fact
that everyone here &apos;s getting us stuff .
han came in with a small package today
and also he was carrying a gift bag .
we &apos;ll find some money for the gifts .
people aren &apos;t expecting anything big .
happy holidays .
people just got the nothing big they were expecting .
gather , please . i have a very special gift
for all my diner employees .
health insurance ?
come on , it &apos;s christmastime , not crazy time .
it &apos;s art . it &apos;s a one of a kind silk screen .
i did it by hand .
i figured that &apos;s how you always have to do it .
han , it &apos;s the diner . this is amazing .
open the door . i put something behind it
that reminds me of each of you .
mine has sophie .
mine has a saxophone .
mine has a cupcake .
mine has a chainsaw .
hey , everybody !
holiday shopping tip :
fill a starbucks cup with vodka .
also good for waitressing .
sophie , were you christmas shopping ?
oh , you know i was !
power strips !
oh good . you got surge protectors .
wow , that &apos;s the first time protection &apos;s
ever been used in your apartment .
well , my christmas village needs 75,000 watts .
and that &apos;s just to work my candy cane helicopter .
sophie &apos;s been so busy with the polish society decorating contest .
we haven &apos;t had sex in days .
well , i got to beat my nemesis , felka bobenski .
she wins every year .
she &apos;s like the modern family of christmas decorations
you know who &apos;s having a blue christmas this year ?
my balls .
i love this city at the holidays .
yeah , the urine &apos;s all frozen
so you can &apos;t really smell it .
manhattan is the best place to buy quality christmas gifts .
we have 40 bucks .
now , where are those duffel bags
full of stolen electronics sold for half the price
by nairobi refugees ?
well , we better find them soon
or i &apos;m going to give up and go to radio shack
like everyone else who goes to radio shack .
oh my god , max .
my childhood bank .
you had a childhood bank ?
i didn &apos;t even have a childhood .
come on , let &apos;s go . i stop in every few months
to get caught on the security cameras ,
so people will think i &apos;m still in the mix .
trying to get caught on security cameras ?
whoa , we are different .
yeah , we &apos;ll just go in and while we &apos;re in here ,
well , i don &apos;t know , ask for a business loan .
we are not getting a business loan !
you tricked me into coming to the city .
at least knock me out and put me in the trunk like a person .
okay , i hear you . no loan .
but can we at least go in there
so i can get a hit off some vault fumes
and a complimentary christmas cocoa ?
yeah , i want one too .
it &apos;s so cold out here
my bra is suing my nipples for assault .
i &apos;d say we ask for $ 15,000 .
so close i almost smelled a 100 .
what is with you ?
if i wanted you to keep lying to me ,
i &apos;d date you .
max , we need more capital
so we can buy our shirts in bulk ,
and then , if we work even harder ,
we can double our profit .
okay , we won &apos;t pass even the credit check .
according to my social security number ,
i died in a boat explosion years ago .
this is the time to apply .
bankers have more guilt at christmastime
because of it &apos;s a wonderful life .
主角是善良热心助人的储蓄贷款公司负责人
and also &apos; cause they &apos;re jewish .
i &apos;m the one with the business degree ,
and you have to trust me on this .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re the business genius . what do i know ?
let &apos;s go get that loan .
thank you !
yeah , i should have known that was too good to be true .
max , come on .
the bank &apos;s there . our shirt &apos;s in here .
let &apos;s just go in , show them , and apply for that loan .
please !
no .
please !
no .
please !
no .
and that right there was a little something
called &quot; us asking for a bank loan . &quot;
now let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m not leaving here until you tell me
what the underlying issue is .
i &apos;m not in love with you anymore .
max , be serious .
this whole t @-@ shirt was your idea .
what &apos;s the real problem ?
that &apos;s the problem .
those shirts were my idea
and nothing that comes from me is worth $ 15,000 .
aside from that baby i sold on e @-@ baby .
max , i know these t @-@ shirts are a money @-@ maker .
oh , i have a money @-@ maker and that &apos;s not it .
i can prove it .
look , this is rodney ,
my childhood over @-@ priced clothing store .
if i had known we were going on the childhood tour today ,
i would have worn more comfortable shoes
and stayed home .
see the shirt on the mannequin ?
at least $ 200 .
and there &apos;s no reason we can &apos;t sell ours for just as much .
i &apos;ll show you . follow me .
oh , okay , i will . but not on instagram ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re out of control .
this place is fancy
and i &apos;ve been to the new port authority in newark .
与纽约州三大机场之一的纽瓦克自由国际机场
just trust me , okay ?
you need to jump on those wang pumps
or like ben affleck , they will be &quot; gone , girl . &quot;
字面上也有 &quot; 卖完啦 姑娘 &quot; 的意思

i &apos;ve been clean since fire island 2010 .
每年都有同性恋活动
and 2012 .

because it &apos;s hard for me
to just be near you and not be high .
yeah , you get it , girl .
actually , we wanted to see if you &apos;d be interested
in selling one of our fabulous graphic t @-@ shirts .
oh , n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n--
all sorts of &quot; no , &quot; okay ?
as much as i love a fez , a caftan , and a teenage boy ,
this isn &apos;t morocco .
that &apos;s a really long and boring version of &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s like you just did &quot; no ! the one woman show . &quot;
here &apos;s our t @-@ shirt--
look .
i &apos;ll tell you two what i said to a young marc jacobs .
stop offering , i &apos;m off the junk .

what are you ? american psycho ?
主角白天是华尔街娇子 晚上是连环杀人魔
as soon as someone says &quot; no &quot; to you ,
you start dismembering women .
i can &apos;t get her shirt off .
tell her she can spend the night
and you &apos;ll buy her a waffle in the morning .
okay , hand me our shirt .
i think this is gonna be big for us .

barry is coming .
i &apos;m guessing mostly with strangers .
seriously ?
seriously ?

people will think i have a personality .
barry , put this with my other stuff .

300 .
forget the sober story . that guy is high .
i &apos;ll take ten .
they &apos;ll make great hanukkah gifts
for my friends who don &apos;t hate their arms .
all our shirts just got bought by a rich dead lady .
i &apos;ll need 30 more by friday .
yes , i &apos;m still holding .
i need to place a rush t @-@ shirt order .
no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t put me on hold again .
i &apos;ve been through seven rounds of
grandma got run over by a reindeer .
and she just got run over again .
now that we have all this crazy gay t @-@ shirt money ,
i think we should up the prices on these gifts .
so we agree , we &apos;re getting earl a car .
sophie is getting the country house with the lake she &apos;s always wanted .
max , rodney is selling our shirts for 300,
but we only get 25 of that .
and you can &apos;t buy a house for $ 750 .
it &apos;s not detroit .
房产市场崩溃 价格一落千丈
yes , hi , hi , hi . finally a person .
i need 50 t @-@ shirts by friday .
but your business card says you guarantee next @-@ day delivery .
oh , you can &apos;t &quot; guarantee &quot; that guarantee ?
okay , now oleg .
what do you get a man who has nothing ,
but shows you everything ?
what do you mean &quot; is there anything else you can help me with ? &quot;
when did you help me at all ?
and i &apos;m beginning to think if grandma works for you ,
she didn &apos;t get run over by that reindeer ,
she threw herself under a sleigh .
so , sophie &apos;s getting a snapple .
like last year .
max , we can &apos;t give up . we can do them ourselves .
we just need someone else to do them .
come on , let &apos;s go .
there are customers who have been here
since robin thicke was relevant .
wait a minute , han . you silk @-@ screened all those beautiful cards .
you have an artistic side .
yeah , but no backside .
and a front side that shouldn &apos;t be allowed outside .
why is this taking so long ?
you did all those christmas cards .
aren &apos;t small creatures supposed to be fast ?
truth be told , those were supposed to be ready last year .
but , what was the rush ?
you two weren &apos;t going anywhere .
han , just a simple &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no . &quot;
no judgment .
have you had sex with this machine ?
the only thing worse than you two working for me
is me working for you .
you haven &apos;t even given me water .
water is for closers .
by &quot; closers , &quot; i mean people who actually make clothes .
who &apos;s that ?
han , did you call child protective service on us ?
&apos;cause those bruises could be from anyone .
han , you &apos;ve only made one shirt in two hours .
and it &apos;s a masterpiece . do you want one citizen kane
or 30 here comes the booms ?
guys , i need your help .
sophie &apos;s right behind me and needs some cheering up .
i haven &apos;t seen her this depressed
since she woke up mid @-@ coitus last night .
hi .
hi . hi , girls .
merry christmas .
quick question :
if i were to turn on that oven and close all the windows ,
would i die ?
nope .
otherwise i wouldn &apos;t be standing here
next to kim jong @-@ only @-@ done @-@ one .
sophie , what &apos;s the problem ?
tell han while he gets back to work .
and han , pick up the pace
or i &apos;m going to start the pinching again .
i &apos;m gonna lose the christmas decorating contest .
oh , i have nothing to live for .
oh , caroline , this is probably how you feel every day .
sophie &apos;s competition made a live @-@ action
north pole workshop in front of her house .
well , all i got upstairs is a light @-@ up nativity
and $ 25,000 worth of target christmas decorations .
she blew five fuses last night .
i never thought i &apos;d be jealous of a fuse .
sophie , we really can &apos;t get into this now .
we are way behind with these t @-@ shirts .
and these t @-@ shirts are a once in a lifetime chance
for us to go to a new place with our business .
oh yeah , i hear you , girls .
i mean , what am i doing here
sitting worrying about some silly contest ?
it &apos;s christmas .
come on everybody .
we should all be helping the girls .
really ? that would be so amazing .
sure ! and you wouldn &apos;t even have to pay me back
by letting me use your barn and your horse tomorrow night
for a live nativity scene , which you would all have to be in .
or something like that .
i think we just had a seasonal shake @-@ down .
han &apos;s doing the last one . we &apos;re gonna make it .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re in such a good mood with that beard .
last week when you found those two chin hairs ,
you weren &apos;t so chipper .
i &apos;m just so happy i have new clothes .
okay , final shirt .
then i get you two out of my angel hair .
han , you know , if it weren &apos;t for you ,
we would have never gotten this done .
you really are a little angel .
yeah , you are . but i &apos;m still surprised
you weren &apos;t cast as the baby .
oh , i was asked , but i declined .
i spent ten year getting out of diapers .
i &apos;m not getting back in .
han , for your christmas gift ,
i &apos;ll pretend i never heard that .
places everybody .
the judges are coming . i &apos;m ready .
joseph &apos;s ready . cabbage patch christ is ready .
come on !
what &apos;s with the cleavage ?
i know .
she &apos;s like the not @-@ so @-@ virgin mary .
angel , shepherd , lady with the beard ,
come on , get in the stable .
stable ?
the way we look it should be an &quot; unstable . &quot;
everybody ready ? i &apos;m going to open the barn door .
yeah , i think your barn door &apos;s already a little open .
okay now , who am i again ?
voltron ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie . one of the wise men
might have smoked some &quot; myrrh @-@ ijuana . &quot;
献上黄金 乳香 没药作为礼物
that was a very nice christmas gift , max .
thanks , earl . by the way , sophie ,
the barn and us dressed like idiots ?
that &apos;s your christmas gift .
oh , and hey , bang oleg later .
oleg , that &apos;s your gift .
how did you know ?
before they come in , let &apos;s just take a moment to look around
and really let in the true spirit of christmas .
i don &apos;t remember writing you a monologue .
shut up !
get your ass over by the horse .
come on , han . hit the music .
all right , everybody ,
look holy .
best i can do is my underwear .
oh , crap !
oh , that &apos;s right , felka .
i &apos;m the freakin &apos; mother of god .
we won !
i &apos;m so happy we won .
we won ! we won !
okay , show &apos;s over .
dump the kid , i &apos;ll be upstairs .
max , take care of cabbage patch christ .
here , han . you got a buddy your own size .
thank you so much , barry .
and remember , i want 50 more shirts
after the first of the year when i &apos;m back from rehab .
&apos;cause ladies , i am planning a very white christmas .
max , this is amazing !
do you know what just happened in there ?
yeah , i stole some dope @-@ ass fingerless gloves .
we &apos;re in business with them now .
you have to bring those back .
i got them for you .
okay .
this is like a christmas miracle .
our shirts are being sold in
the most exclusive bitchy boutique in manhattan
and they want more , lots more .
hey , let &apos;s go into your childhood bank .
i need to take an adult pee .
okay , but this isn &apos;t home , so remember ,
put the seat down when you &apos;re done .
and while we &apos;re in there , we can apply for that loan .
no , no , no , no , no . we can &apos;t .
now i &apos;m afraid .
come on , what &apos;s the real issue here ?
we just had this amazing success .
and it looks like things are going our way ,
and if we go in there , it could all be ruined .
you know what would ruin our lives even more ?
if we don &apos;t get that loan and have to spend hours
with han standing under us trying to finish those shirts .
well , that &apos;s a real &quot; nightmare before christmas . &quot;
let &apos;s go .
good , cause i &apos;m starting to pee a little .
he gave us a loan !
is everyone who works on the street high ?
i can &apos;t believe it . it didn &apos;t go bad .
i &apos;m getting everything i want .
walk on the outside of the sidewalk .
i &apos;m gonna get hit by a bus .
i mean , how could he give us a loan ?
i didn &apos;t even have to flash my boobs .
then why did you do it ?
i don &apos;t know . they were making it rain .
i felt obliged .
max , do you have a dollar ?
i don &apos;t know . do you have change for 10,000 ?
yeah , here . for what ?
for those less fortunate
anne hathaway &apos;s here ?
oh , my god . look ! look !
whoa , no way ! no way !
max , i have chills .
well , it is snowing and there &apos;s no fingers on those gloves .
i love these .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t get you anything .
i &apos;m just not a thief .
what do you mean you didn &apos;t get me anything ?
you got me everything . look .
