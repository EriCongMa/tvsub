mr. bishop ?
so i don &apos;t you making the same mistake as the government , thinking that ,
because of the color of my skin , i sell drugs .
why shouldn &apos;t the courts be kept honest about bishop ?
everybody deserves representation .
does that stop suddenly when it comes to ...
a criminal organization whose sole purpose is to sell drugs ?
blake calamar .
in baltimore , he was working two jobs .
when he wasn &apos;t protecting bond &amp; associates interest ,
he was out protecting ms @-@ 13,
baltimore &apos;s biggest meth gang .
bond played us against each other .
i don &apos;t like being played .
so i suggest we do the same to bond .
counselor ?
thank you , your honor .
mr. rubio , what is your job ?
i &apos;m a guard at the northeast illinois correctional center .
and what is this ?
an outdoor cell on the yard .
we use it when an inmate acts up in the prison yard .
and did anyone act up on september 14th of last year ?
yes , sir .
some inmates got in a fight ,
so i placed one in the cage .
and was it this inmate ?
yes , sir .
jay winston .
then i turned away to handle the others ,
and when i came back , he was ...
winston was stabbed .
and this is how you found him ?
yes , sir . dead .
with this weapon ?
yes , sir .
a shiv found inside the cage .
and who did this shiv belong to ?
him .
you &apos;re referring to joey church , inmate # 321120 ?
yes , sir .
nothing further .
mr. rubio ,
were you aware of any previous conflicts
between my client , joey , and the victim ?
no .
winston had just been transferred in the week before .
and how long did my client have left on his 18 month sentence ?
two weeks .
do you find many convicts with two weeks left
on their sentence performing acts like this one ?
objection .
sustained .
to clarify , mr. rubio ,
you didn &apos;t see the stabbing occur ?
no . unfortunately , i did not .
and how did you determine that this shiv was my client &apos;s ?
well , they found his dna on it .
but it was fashioned from his toothbrush , correct ?
yeah .
so that would explain the dna .
objection .
outside mr. rubio &apos;s expertise .
i think it &apos;s just common sense , don &apos;t you ?
the defendant &apos;s toothbrush would have his dna on it .
overruled .
mr. rubio , do inmates ever steal personal items from one another ?
all the time .
so it &apos;s possible that another inmate stole my client &apos;s toothbrush ?
sure , possible .
nothing further .
your honor , at this time , we would like to be heard
on precluding the prosecution &apos;s next witness .
your honor , the defense had ample time to argue during pretrial .
yes , but new information has come to our attention .
come on . i &apos;m always amazed
at how convenient this new information is .
counselors .
shall we take this lovely little debating society into my chambers ?
they &apos;re coming after bought testimony .
no . they &apos;d play that in court .
it &apos;s the lie detector .
they dinged us on lack of motive .
we need our eyewitness .
i know .
uh @-@ oh .
whenever i see that bitch , i know we &apos;re in trouble .
their eyewitness denied seeing anything , your honor .
yes , initially , because he didn &apos;t want to be seen as a stool pigeon .
we offered no deal .
mr. ellis changed his mind of his own free will .
after the police conducted a lie detector test .
a lie detector test he willingly agreed to .
which caused him to change his mind
and claim he saw this stabbing .
right . because he was caught lying by the lie detector .
carob chips , anyone ?
i &apos;m good .
um ... the bottom line , your honor ,
is we don &apos;t intend to reference the lie detector in court .
we only intend to use mr. ellis &apos; testimony .
your honor , this is a sworn affidavit from iderdex .
it &apos;s a manufacturer that services all cook county lie detectors .
they claim , during the week in question ,
the lie detector was out of service .
clearly , this was a case of the police conducting an x detector .
that is guesswork .
an x detector ? educate me .
it &apos;s when the police attach the suspect to a fake lie detector ,
such as an xbox or a xerox machine ,
making him think that he &apos;s been caught lying .
your honor , even if what mrs. florrick alleges is true ,
i would cite people v. lee .
the police have lee way to misrepresent during an interrogation .
i know your boss thinks i &apos;m pro @-@ defense .
excuse me ?
your boss-- mr. childs .
i know he thinks because i pal around
with bill ayers and the like that i &apos;m pro @-@ defense .
well , i don &apos;t believe that , your honor .
the only problem is when i try to be pro @-@ prosecution ,
the police pull a stunt like this .
people v. lee is not absolute , counselor .
this was an extrinsic misrepresentation
and therefore your eyewitness is excluded .
thank the police , not me .
good job .
i didn &apos;t see that one coming .
ah , i have to keep you on your toes .
so , anything new on blake ?
you just got my only eyewitness kicked
and you want my help ?
yeah .
we &apos;re talking a ten percent cut across all departments .
it &apos;s not our choice .
if you haven &apos;t noticed ,
cook county is going through a budget crisis .
so , everybody keep an eye on the o.t.
and unload any dead wood .
we &apos;ve got a dispo dump at the end of the month .
so separate the chaff .
what about investigator time ?
we just got beaten in court
because the defense was one step ahead of us .
we &apos;re all doing more with less .
some of us aren &apos;t .
if you &apos;re referring to the bishop investigation , drugs are drugs .
so we just let a case from lockhart / gardner slip through the cracks ?
if any case slips through the cracks ,
the problem isn &apos;t the budget , the problem is the a.s.a.
get creative .
use what you know .
okay , moving on .
here &apos;s what i know .
no , we already questioned him .
he had nothing to offer .
he &apos;s got a parole hearing in a week .
yep . he might be more open to questioning .
getting creative .
cary .
don &apos;t say anything about the hair .
what &apos;s going on ?
i hate to lose .
and i hate to lose to someone who &apos;s outspending me two to one .
you &apos;re on that prison knifing , aren &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s just a pro bono for them .
they got kalinda on it .
let me look into that .
diane lockhart approached me .
about ?
a job .
and ?
i don &apos;t want to go .
but you &apos;ve got student loans .
yes , i do .
i put you on these lockhart &amp; gardner cases
because you know them .
so , show me you know them .
go ahead , read it .
it says because i have a white husband ,
i &apos;m not really black .
it says my kids are half @-@ breeds .
it says they should be embarrassed to go to school .
look at it .
it &apos;s not us .
it &apos;s being distributed in african @-@ american neighborhoods .
church parking lots .
makes no sense for me to go there .
let me read it to you . &quot; is she really .. &quot; &quot;
come on , wendy .
we &apos;re all adults .
we all could have gone into aluminum siding
but we didn &apos;t-- we chose politics .
i haven &apos;t gone there with either of you .
well , congratulations .
and i &apos;m telling you i didn &apos;t do it .
now tell me why you &apos;re really here .
i want a two @-@ way race .
i do , too .
peter &apos;s desperate .
he &apos;s almost out of cash .
people are dangerous when they &apos;re desperate .
let &apos;s talk about it .
there &apos;s certain things i can &apos;t do .
but i can ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i was in the prison yard ,
but i didn &apos;t see the attack .
i already said all this .
yeah , we noticed your parole hearing was in a week .
we thought that might jog your memory .
look ,
honestly , i didn &apos;t see it happen .
but ... church told me he did it .
he told you ?
yeah .
i couldn &apos;t believe it .
take a chance like that
with two weeks left on your sentence ?
why didn &apos;t you tell the investigator before ?
he didn &apos;t ask .
so why did church do it ?
did @-@ did he say ?
because of what winston called him .
and what was that ?
the &quot; n &quot; word .
so we have our motive .
what ?
i love to see how uncomfortable
it makes you white folk .
what ?
am i not supposed to say the &quot; n &quot; word anymore ?
no , it makes me feel
all warm and post @-@ racial fuzzy .
you know we have a problem now .
we have a motive ,
but it &apos;s sympathetic .
how do you figure ?
there &apos;s four african- americans on the jury .
church just killed someone who called him the &quot; n &quot; word .
so how is it going to go over with them ?
ms. scott @-@ carr .
mrs. florrick .
i agree .
it &apos;s appalling .
my daughter brought it home from school .
she was crying .
i held her for an hour .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m really very sorry ,
but i think you need to speak to my husband .
because you &apos;re just the wife ?
no . because the campaign is the campaign .
do you believe there are certain things so ...
appalling ,
they &apos;re no longer the campaign ?
yes .
but i also think you are in a three @-@ way race ,
and it &apos;s unclear who did this .
we &apos;re both mothers first , aren &apos;t we ?
professional women concerned about the world , yes ,
but always our children come before everything .
i would do anything for my daughters
to see them not hurt , to see them not crying .
you &apos;re the same ?
yes .
it alleges that your son got his girlfriend pregnant ,
and that your husband paid for their abortion .
i &apos;m sure you join me in finding this appalling , too .
and i &apos;m sure there &apos;s no truth to it ,
as there was none to this .
i think president obama tagged this part
of the campaign as the silly season .
it &apos;s an unfortunate characterization ,
&apos;cause i find nothing silly about this .
next time you want to come to my office ,
you make an appointment .
as one mother to another ,
if you have any sway there ,
tell your campaign
to stop this silliness .
and i will make sure your children
don &apos;t come home crying .
good @-@ bye .
to a better future .
do you know how patronizing this is ?
i do , but is it true ?
so you think a white jury wouldn &apos;t judge fairly
because the motive ...
that &apos;s different .
there &apos;s no white equivalent to the &quot; n &quot; word .
maybe there should be .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
so , you don &apos;t think we &apos;ll risk
jury nullification with this motive ?
i think we can &apos;t generalize .
i think people do things for a lot of reasons ,
and i think a generalization is being made here
based on ...
o.j.
based on a false generalization
of african @-@ american overreaction to a slur .
this crime happened in prison .
this wasn &apos;t a white wine garden party , this was prison .
and i think we can argue , pretty convincingly ,
that the &quot; n &quot; word is tossed off with some frequency there .
then let &apos;s go with the &quot; n &quot; word .
it explains why church would stab someone
two weeks before release .
geneva , you do the questioning .
with relish .
and one more thing .
mr. agos had brought it to my attention
that a defense investigator &apos;s had much success against us .
so i am stepping up our investigation into kalinda sharma .
we believe the police have leaked to her ,
judges have leaked to her ,
and even some of our own .
i want you to keep track of all contact .
we are going to do our utmost
to keep this a level battlefield , okay ?
good job , cary .
&quot; good job , cary . &quot;
you know how long i &apos;ve worked with him , and not a word ?
good job , geneva .
yup , it helps to have a penis .
the defense attorney is alicia florrick .
she &apos;s smart .
she &apos;ll make you like her .
she &apos;ll ask if you &apos;ve been offered anything
in exchange for your testimony .
you need to be able to truthfully say no .
so i &apos;m going to tell you
exactly what we can &apos;t offer you .
we can &apos;t put in a good word
at your next parole hearing .
we can &apos;t trade you anything .
not now .
then she &apos;s gonna ask you , what did i tell you next ?
and i need you to remember something .
what ?
just give me a minute .
you going to get out ?
you need something ?
yeah . why are you following me ?
you ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not following you .
blake calamar .
you here for lockhart / gardner or ms @-@ 13 ?
oh , you are working with some old information there , buddy .
okay , well , i got some advice for you , buddy .
don &apos;t follow me .
i &apos;m just standing where i &apos;m standing .
i can make things difficult for you for both your jobs .
oh , you don &apos;t want to do that .
actually , i do want to do that .
i just don &apos;t know if i need to .
you don &apos;t carry a gun , college boy .
i don &apos;t need to .
and you &apos;re a hell of a long way from baltimore .
go for it . it &apos;s not mine .
hello ?
oh , hi , ms. lockhart .
how are you today ?
oh , no . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m good .
no , it &apos;s a great time .
what can i do for you ?
what was that about ?
it &apos;s , uh , posturing .
lockhart / gardner &apos;s second investigator .
they have two investigators on a pro bono ?
we need help .
so in your opinion , mr. howell , there was a motive ?
well , yeah .
he called him the &quot; n &quot; word , so , sure .
no further questions .
mr. howell , you &apos;re in prison for check kiting ?
yes .
and i really regret it .
i got behind in my bills , and you know ,
young , stupid mistake .
did mr. agos prep you with that answer ?
oh , sure .
and ...
what did he ask you to say ?
well , let me see if i can remember .
he said to tell you that i &apos;d been offered nothing
in exchange for my testimony , and that ...
and when he ... ?
objection .
your honor , mrs. florrick didn &apos;t allow the witness to answer fully .
is that true , mr. howell ?
oh , yeah . it &apos;s a long answer .
continue .
well , then mr. agos said you &apos;d ask me
an open @-@ ended question which would allow me
to talk for a while about my answer .
speaking from my heart , i &apos;ve been offered nothing in trade for being here .
my reasons are of a personal nature .
i found god in prison ,
and i &apos;m remaking myself in his image .
it &apos;s allowed me to look back on my life
and realize where i &apos;ve strayed from the path .
i heard .
the race card .
yes . they have their motive .
the jury ate it up .
and i walked right into a trap .
never ask an open @-@ ended question .
okay , okay , let me talk to blake .
why ?
he may have something .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s okay . you don &apos;t have to .
what do you mean ? i &apos;m the lead attorney .
why wouldn &apos;t i have to ?
when you two decide on the strategy , tell me .
so what i &apos;m saying is we are not made of money .
mrs. florrick . hello .
xerox room ?
uh , anyway , we need to make
big moves with little gestures .
mrs. florrick , this is a surprise .
stay there .
i want to talk to you .
no . it &apos;s childs .
this flyer was designed
to undercut wendy &apos;s african @-@ american base .
that &apos;s not in childs &apos; interests .
it is in ours . peter &apos;s .
childs is looking toward the endgame ;
votes are votes .
he wants african @-@ americans to sit on their hands .
we have supporters ...
who are willing to do what we want .
as does childs . as does wendy .
and you &apos;re in contact with them ? with ours ?
some , but i don &apos;t control them .
where did you get this ?
wendy .
she visited my office .
have you talked to peter ?
not yet .
i will take care of this .
do .
um , these would be helpful to me .
that help we need , we &apos;ll find it here .
we find a five @-@ year @-@ old investigator ?
or a six @-@ year @-@ old .
andrew !
no , no , no .
yeah !
the clarion call of duty .
the innocence project was a million years ago .
it was two years ago , and you were the best one there .
yeah , well , i &apos;m super dad now , see ?
nina &apos;s ipo goes public next month .
i don &apos;t need the sofa change cook county offers .
then do it for the fun . come on .
you &apos;re not a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad .
honey , go over there and play , baby .
daddy needs to brush off these nice people .
bryan stone-- used to be an airline executive
until his wife started a line of purses .
rodrigo thorton just retired from the second circuit .
his wife invented a computer app
that just made its first million .
i &apos;m in good company .
you &apos;re being bred like the matrix .
yeah , well , let &apos; em .
i &apos;m tired of bringing home the bacon .
come on . we &apos;ve got good dental .
come on in .
you &apos;ve seen this ? what blake found ?
i have now .
you think we should use it ?
i think i was told to defer to the partners ,
so that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
and if you weren &apos;t deferring ?
i would ask if it were true .
we &apos;re running into difficulties with the original strategy .
yes , but if the new strategy isn &apos;t true ,
it &apos;ll be easy to undercut .
what do you think ?
i think we don &apos;t have much choice .
so you have no memory
of mr. winston calling you the &quot; n &quot; word ?
no . i mean , i &apos;m not saying he didn &apos;t ,
but , hey , if inmates killed based on that ,
there &apos;d be nobody left in prison .
did anything unusual happen the day before
mr. winston was killed ?
yeah .
a man visited me in prison .
what man ?
i don &apos;t know . he was about mid @-@ 30s ,
white , five @-@ ten .
he was wearing a baseball cap .
this man ?
objection , your honor !
this is surveillance video from the northeast illinois
correctional center on july tenth .
i &apos;ll allow .
and you had never seen this man before ?
never .
who &apos;s that in the photo he &apos;s showing you ?
my daughter , evie .
she &apos;s ten months old .
oh , hell .
and why did this man show you a photo of our daughter ?
he said he &apos;d kill her
if i didn &apos;t do something about jay winston .
mr. church ,
did you kill jay winston ?
yes .
and why did you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i never hurted nobody before ever , but ...
he had a photo of my little girl .
he ...
it was taken from inside my house .
he said he &apos;d kill my whole family .
it &apos;s not true .
okay , tell us .
tell you what , that it &apos;s not true ?
it &apos;s not true .
all of it ?
yeah , all of it .
dad , they say things
about your campaign all the time .
i know .
and becca , is she your ...
is she your girlfriend ?
no .
she was .
not anymore .
you know , it &apos;s just that
we never really talked about it , zach .
dad , please . it &apos;s okay .
well , you need to protect yourself .
mom .
zach and i talked last year
when you were ... away .
i found condoms in his backpack .
not mine .
it &apos;s a friend &apos;s .
and i kept them .
and we were to talk if he ever needed them .
i know it &apos;s hard for you to talk to us .
but we &apos;re here .
we &apos;re always here for you .
okay .
hey , dad ,
is it getting out ?
no .
we &apos;re going to stop it .
thanks .
well , that was a farce .
why ? you don &apos;t believe him ?
would you have told your parents ?
we didn &apos;t tell my parents .
christmas vacation--
we were supposed to sleep in separate rooms .
yeah , but we were a heck of a lot older than zach .
and kids are growing up a heck of a lot faster .
you could have told me about the condoms , you know .
yeah , i could have .
i want to share the bedroom again .
my parents slept in separate bedrooms for 20 years .
i don &apos;t want my parents &apos; marriage .
i don &apos;t either .
because i &apos;m not just a dad .
i &apos;m not just a man on your arm .
and i &apos;m not just your roommate .
i know .
so ?
i need to think .
so who is he ?
he had to sign in .
we had to sign in .
he did sign in--
under an assumed name .
fake license .
how is that possible ? it ...
it isn &apos;t .
somebody made a mistake .
rita ?
who ? who signed him in ?
no . the baby carrots .
just tell her the baby carrots are a train .
yeah .
who signed him in ?
that &apos;s where this gets interesting .
i don &apos;t remember much about him .
i guess he used a fake i.d. , huh ?
yeah . so it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s kind of odd .
how many guards are there here ?
285 . 63 per shift .
and yet , in the matter of one week i &apos;ve dealt with you twice .
i don &apos;t understand .
i think what he means ... oh , sorry .
it &apos;s probably just ... it &apos;s nap time .
hold on , rita .
i think what he means is ,
not only were you turned the wrong way during the murder ,
you &apos;re also the guard who let the mystery baseball man in .
go ahead , rita .
so ?
just interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
i find it so .
this is not looking good .
i know we don &apos;t consult .
i know we don &apos;t coordinate .
but if we had a safe word ,
i would be screaming it right now .
you want me to stop whipping you ?
wendy scott @-@ carr .
the flyers involving her white husband .
i don &apos;t know if they &apos;re us ,
but if they are , stop .
you want to know if they &apos;re us ?
no , but if they are , i need them to stop .
that would be consulting .
yes . which i &apos;m not doing .
okay , here &apos;s the problem .
do you want to know the problem ?
i can &apos;t stop ,
because they &apos;re not us .
i don &apos;t believe you .
that &apos;s your prerogative .
i do know who they are , though .
who ?
your pac .
you took the money .
they &apos;re insuring their investment .
you can tell them to stop ,
but you &apos;re going to have to find some new money .
so we tell them to stop with the racist flyers ,
they take away the money and our campaign is out of business .
yep , that &apos;s about it .
but who said a conscience is cheap ?
what &apos;s this ?
prison guard &apos;s work history .
look at his job two years ago .
leacrest stables .
lemond bishop .
he owns them .
but i don &apos;t get it .
why would lemond bishop want winston dead ?
here , halfway down the page .
transfer notice .
winston was to be transferred to a courthouse holding cell
for a week .
for questioning ?
it doesn &apos;t say .
spilling to the feds .
let &apos;s say winston has dirt on lemond bishop .
daddy .
now , if i were ... hello .
if i were lemond bishop ,
then i would want to get rid of him , wouldn &apos;t i ?
so we have to prove church wasn &apos;t just a pawn .
he was part of it .
no , we just have to go out just for a few minutes
to do a little research , don &apos;t we ?
and then we &apos;ll be back .
oh , really ?
oh , mr. gold .
becca . thank you , ladies .
see ya .
bye .
bye .
you seem ... upset .
how is it that i can manage aldermen and judges
and yet i still seem to have
this ridiculous little mean girl thorn in my shoe .
maybe you &apos;re secretly in love .
here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m not going to ask ,
&apos;cause i know you &apos;ll only lie ,
and that &apos;s okay .
it actually makes things easier .
what things ?
when you &apos;re asked , you did not sleep with zach .
you did not hook up with him .
you did not have an abortion .
you don &apos;t have to think . just say yes .
yes .
and what if i did ?
what if you did what ?
slept with zach , and had an abortion ?
then we &apos;d have to discuss what was provable .
lake drive health center .
i was there on may 18th .
oops .
does that make your job harder ?
listen ...
no , mr. gold , i &apos;m tired of listening .
have zach phone me .
i like zach .
i don &apos;t want to make his life harder .
i want to make it easier .
may 18th .
working back , you weren &apos;t showing ,
so that means a march , april conception .
that &apos;s when you were sleeping with mr. hock--
you &apos;re after @-@ school college prep tutor .
yes . appalling , isn &apos;t it ?
i investigate my opponents .
too bad you don &apos;t have the resources to do the same .
so ...
whenever anyone asks whether you slept with zach ,
what do you say ?
it &apos;s very easy .
i know , given your history ,
it &apos;s probably a new word for you ,
but you say no .
let &apos;s try it .
no .
good .
always lovely , becca .
what &apos;s up ?
just saying hello .
kalinda , why don &apos;t ...
i want to talk to you , but i &apos;m going to head out .
you &apos;re being investigated .
what ?
childs .
you &apos;re doing too well .
it won &apos;t be much of an investigation ,
&apos;cause i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
a lot of people leak to you .
yeah , friends .
yeah . well , they &apos;re going to be scarce .
does that mean you as well ?
what are you guys doing with bishop ?
i thought will and diane backed away from him .
yeah , they did .
the church defense ?
it &apos;s not some little pro bono , is it ?
you don &apos;t put two investigators on a pro bono .
i , um , i don &apos;t know .
you know what i think ?
i think you guys are auditioning for bishop .
bishop ?
yep .
i thought we were out of the drug kingpin business .
he lost his previous representation ,
and my guess is , it &apos;s too lucrative .
do you ever feel like we &apos;re on the wrong side ?
all the time .
maybe it &apos;s not bad .
there are 44 equity partners .
we need 23 to vote bond out .
he has 22 certain votes .
no , 28 .
how do you figure ?
his people ...
plus the people in litigation we pissed off .
24 maybe . and they may not be so certain
if they knew that bond was making a deal
with a drug kingpin .
or they may be more certain .
it &apos;s a new economy .
that &apos;s what the joey church defense was about , right ?
we represent church to gain favor with bishop .
yep , we successfully defend a bishop lieutenant ,
he swings business our way .
it &apos;s a smart move . brings in a fast influx .
so we need to start lining up votes now .
we can &apos;t be seen together so much .
he &apos;ll get suspicious .
yep . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
it &apos;s money , hand over fist ! what were you thinking ? !
you can do better . do it !
don &apos;t worry .
internecine warfare creates healthy competition .
hey , i know it from my business .
show me results and i &apos;m happy .
okay , andrew , we &apos;re freezing our asses off out here .
hey ! hey @-@ hey @-@ hey @-@ hey !
all right , all right , sorry .
what did you find ?
joey church .
good respectable dad .
good respectable meth habit .
no apparent connection to mr. bishop .
never worked for him . never bought from him .
they move in completely different circles .
i &apos;m not seeing much good here .
hey ! hey , slow down !
oh , you &apos;re gonna stop ?
listen , we got kids in this neighborhood , okay ?
so if you &apos;re gonna drive ...
shove it !
ever hear of northbrook youth soccer ?
are you talking to us ?
northbrook , kids soccer league ?
okay , i haven &apos;t heard of it , but i imagine it exists .
tree frogs . it &apos;s youth soccer .
it &apos;s 2006 .
wasn &apos;t a very good year for them .
five losses , three wins .
look who the coach is .
that &apos;s joey church .
see , here &apos;s the thing-- hey , brian .
i got a vehicle behind on tickets .
it &apos;s a gray lexus , 2009 .
plate is 9 @-@ texas- howard @-@ 2304 .
no , he needs a wheel lock .
yeah , right . thanks .
i never want you as an enemy , man .
so i &apos;m looking at this photo , it occurs to me ;
the sponsor ...
fast &amp; elegant dry cleaners .
bishop .
yep .
it &apos;s one of his legit businesses .
before church got into trouble , he was coaching his son &apos;s team ,
and he solicited bishop for sponsorship .
so we can show they knew each other .
are you sure ?
as far as we can tell , yes .
church was in league with bishop .
we could turn him .
get him to testify against bishop .
or get him to turn on a lieutenant .
work up the pyramid .
just so we &apos;re clear .
we &apos;ve built a very strong case against church .
yes , but church is a small fish .
bishop is the whopper .
a whopper you spent the last five years trying to land .
and now we have new life .
by decimating our case ?
no , by turning the case .
you &apos;ve already turned a half dozen cases ,
and where are you ?
okay , let us discuss it .
sir , you have the dispo dump coming up .
we can nail church . you can &apos;t nail bishop .
give me a minute .
you , too . just one minute .
i need you to talk to the investigators about kalinda .
why ?
they just need some confirmation about a few things .
we &apos;ve been slipped some anonymous information about her .
what information ?
she &apos;s been lying under oath ,
testifying under an assumed name .
well , i don &apos;t know anything about that .
but you can offer a background .
yeah , all right .
good . i &apos;ve been working on some budgetary maneuvers right now .
i should know very quickly if i can improve your position .
i just wanted to drop by and say ...
what ?
there was no abortion .
not with zach .
how do you know ?
she was with somebody else .
i am so sorry about all this in your life .
thank you .
eli , thank you .
and we had nothing to do with the wendy flyer .
it was our pac .
and we don &apos;t have any control over them .
so is wendy still putting out the zach flyer ?
if our pac goes forward ,
then wendy does , too ?
no .
peter told the pac to get lost .
he ... ?
when ?
tonight .
so that means ... ?
we &apos;re bankrupt .
he &apos;s here on a grand jury subpoena .
different case .
does he know anything ?
no .
yeah , more later .
you want something ?
nope , but you might .
i always want something .
joey church .
okay , i &apos;m listening .
and who is that , mr bishop ?
that man there in the baseball cap ?
yes , sir .
that &apos;s one of my associates from california , mr. harden .
again , objection , your honor .
you will have a chance to cross @-@ examine , ms. florrick ,
and the jury will have chance to judge the verisity of mr bishop .
i can &apos;t wait .
and that photo your associate is carrying ,
that is mr. church &apos;s daughter ?
yes .
and why is he doing that ?
i sent him there .
mr. church was worried about
whether his family was being taken care of while he was in prison .
i wanted my associate to assure him they were .
and when you say &quot; taken care of &quot; ?
oh , my god , i &apos;m sorry .
no , not &quot; taken care of . &quot;
supported .
so there was no threat to mr. church
like the defense is claiming ?
no , not at all .
we were merely calming his fears
about his family &apos;s security and health .
and so there was no pressure on mr. church
to commit a crime that he already admitted ?
that &apos;s correct .
thank you .
do you have anything else , counselor ?
no , ma &apos;am . i think that &apos;ll be enough .
what the hell did you do ?
got a conviction for first degree murder .
you sandbagged me .
your case was on the docket for years .
i cleared mine in a week .
by overstepping your authority .
we were gonna use church to get to bishop .
good luck .
i don &apos;t want you to go anywhere .
well , i don &apos;t want to go anywhere .
i &apos;d like to make you an offer .
i &apos;d like that .
hey , kalinda ?
so , canada , huh ?
excuse me ?
i was such an idiot .
i was looking on the west coast .
don &apos;t ask me why .
i &apos;m sorry . what is it you want ?
leela tahiri .
um , she died in a toronto house fire ,
like , eight years ago . the body was never found .
seems she was in some trouble with the cops .
i &apos;m still trying to work out the details .
so that &apos;s me ?
that &apos;s my surmise .
am i wrong ?
i think you need to find that out for yourself .
how are you ?
good .
i love you .
