第一季 第七集
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
amanda !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died ,
he left a road map for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
lydia &apos;s in a coma .
frank was trying to kill her , victoria .
whose idea was it to make the video ?
tell me i &apos;m alone in this ,
and i won &apos;t bother you again .
i &apos;m seeing daniel . i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
get off me !
i think we &apos;re all being set up .
as hamlet said to ophelia ,
&quot; god has given you one face ,
and you make yourself another . &quot;
the battle between these two halves of identity ...
who we are and who we pretend to be , is unwinnable .
conrad , could you please take victoria &apos;s hand
in this next shot ?
and , victoria , can you please show us the ring ?
beautiful . thank you .
so if you had to sum up your quarter century of marriage ,
what exactly would you say is your secret ?
what keeps you two together ?
love and respect .
if you keep that in mind ,
it &apos;s impossible not to go through 25 years
without experiencing certain things
that bond you and make you stronger .
what &apos;s the one thing that has bonded you two forever ?
i would say the birth of our son daniel .
oh , and charlotte , of course .
and you &apos;ll be very happy to hear that my editor
has promised me the front page of the life &amp; leisure section ,
above the fold .
the 25th year in the marriage
of the hamptons &apos; most perfect couple .
ashley .
would you mind giving ms. andetson
a tour of the garden before brunch ?
of course .
i &apos;ll be along in just a minute .
thank you .
the hamptons &apos; most perfect couple .
i don &apos;t know how much more of this i can stomach .
the timing is ... less than ideal ,
but the best thing we can do is go about our lives
as though nothing &apos;s happened .
something has happened .
lydia was almost killed ,
and we don &apos;t know where frank is or what he &apos;s up to .
what we do know is that frank cashed his severance check .
hopefully , that means that &apos;s the last we &apos;ve heard of him .
and what about lydia ?
well , i stationed a guard at her bedside .
and when she wakes up ,
we &apos;ll be the first to know .
may i see some identification ?
it &apos;s okay , big ed .
she &apos;s just a former friend .
oh , you can take five ,
just don &apos;t go too far .
you hired a bodyguard ?
you would , too , if frank had almost blown your kneecaps off .
but as peculiar as it may sound ,
i happen to like my life .
oh , and so did my father ,
until the graysons stole it .
where &apos;s your loyalty to him ?
perhaps i could step back
into more of a consulting role .
fine .
i need you to hack into the hospital &apos;s computer files .
lydia &apos;s out of critical condition ,
but she &apos;s still comatose .
i couldn &apos;t help myself .
good .
that buys us some time to get back on track .
and what horrible fate do you have in store for young daniel ?
daniel &apos;s not a target .
you know that .
you know how much easier your life would be
if you just dropped all this
and went to go live happily ever after with jack ?
unless ...
of course ...
you &apos;re actually falling for daniel ?
you &apos;re just a consultant , remember ?
so which parent spoils you the most ?
easy . my dad .
that &apos;s an understatement .
and what about your brother ?
is there any sibling rivalry there ?
my brother gets away with murder .
notice his absence this morning ?
mm . he really should &apos;ve been here by now .
i can &apos;t imagine what &apos;s keeping him .
daniel &apos;s been doing some charity work
down at the docks in montauk .
tyler barrol , daniel &apos;s harvard friend .
melissa andetson . with the &quot; times . &quot;
tyler &apos;s been staying with us for the summer .
in fact , he &apos;s practically a member of the family .
you should really come
to the anniversary dinner tomorrow night .
of course .
so you &apos;re going to be having an intimate dinner
rather than one of your legendary soirees ?
oh , well , it &apos;s become kind of a tradition on its own ,
just close friends and family .
not to overstep , but may i bring ashley as my date ?
oh , tyler , i &apos;m sure the graysons
already have enough people .
mm . it &apos;s a lovely idea .
great .
then i &apos;ll bring a date , too .
last i heard , you and adam had broken up .
let &apos;s keep it to tradition .
hey , bud .
well , look what the cat dragged in .
your mother is ready to kill you .
she &apos;s not alone , by the way .
i know . i know . i got this stupid interview ,
which i ...
hold on .
why are you mad at me ?
you honestly don &apos;t remember ?
oh , my god .
did i do that ?
you slammed my head into a wall , danny .
are you serious ?
t @-@ ty , i @-@ i don &apos;t remember a thing from last night .
what--what happened ?
well , apparently , i can &apos;t mention emily &apos;s name
without you going ballistic on me .
what about me ?
nothing . nothing . rough night .
so i heard .
is that why you &apos;ve been ignoring my calls ?
i &apos;m sorry . the night kind of got away from me ,
and i ended up crashing at work .
could we get a little privacy , tyler ?
yeah , of course .
ah , perfect timing .
hey , mom . how &apos;s rio ?
i &apos;m sorry .
the &quot; times &quot; is doing a profile of my mom and dad ,
and i gotta sit down with the reporter .
hey , why don &apos;t you join me ?
i hate these things .
no more than i do .
i &apos;ve never trusted reporters . they can ...
twist your words to sell any story they want .
call you when it &apos;s over .
if it &apos;s okay , i &apos;d rather you not mention me .
yeah . no problem .
you looking for this ?
this is some serious firepower , ms. thorne .
seems unnecessary .
well , that depends on what i &apos;m up against .
you work for the graysons , don &apos;t you ?
no , not anymore .
lost my job ...
due to some strange events .
there &apos;s been a lot of that going around
since you came to town--
you and your pal nolan ross .
you should leave before i call the police .
go ahead .
though i suspect
that you don &apos;t want &apos; em nosing around , do you ?
two years at allenwood juvenile detention ,
conviction for assault with a deadly weapon .
those files were sealed .
at great expense , no doubt .
i was just a kid .
i &apos;m not that girl anymore .
well , you know what ?
you can clean yourself up ,
but zebras don &apos;t change their stripes .
how much do you want ?
yeah , it &apos;s always about money with you people , isn &apos;t it ?
at first , i thought victoria was just paranoid about you ,
but not anymore .
there &apos;s more to your story , little lady .
and i &apos;m gonna find out what it is .
warden , i have amanda clarke on the line .
amanda .
i was hoping never to have to take this call .
i was hoping i &apos;d never have to make it .
but i have a feeling i &apos;m gonna need your help ...
again .
and funnily enough , i &apos;m actually enjoying it .
bartending ? really ?
yeah , it &apos;s been really humbling .
the family that owns the stowaway
have poured their hearts and souls into the business .
i &apos;ve got nothing but respect for them .
you know , daniel , i was rereading the interview
that we did last summer .
you were quite the party boy then .
ugh . you know , people change .
i &apos;ve changed ,
and just in time .
in time for what ?
i ...
what &apos;s her name ?
uh , i &apos;m sorry .
she values her privacy , and i respect that , so--
oh , come on .
just a hint ?
is it serious ?
hopefully .
now if there &apos;s nothing else ?
always a pleasure .
thank you .
did you get everything you need ?
actually , he was a little cagey .
ooh . don &apos;t tell me he gave you
the whole &quot; emily &apos;s a very private person &quot; thing .
actually , he didn &apos;t mention any names at all .
emily who ?
off the record ?
i &apos;ll never eat oysters again .
hey , sorry . that &apos;s how we do it on the docks .
trying to single @-@ handedly restart the economy ?
ah , i find shopping therapeutic .
my parents are making me come
to their stupid anniversary dinner tonight , so ...
i figured the least they could do is treat me to a new dress .
besides ,
you &apos;ll need something to wear .
to your parents &apos; anniversary dinner ?
please don &apos;t say no .
to you ? no way .
but ...
i can dress myself .
even better .
why , exactly , do you need a bodyguard ?
uh , two words , my friend--
net worth .
can i ask you a question ?
friends don &apos;t have to ask if they can ask , so ask .
well , the friends i keep wouldn &apos;t have pushed me
towards a girl that they knew was unavailable .
why &apos;d you do that ?
i never believed that emily was serious about grayson .
jack , i still don &apos;t .
well , maybe you guys aren &apos;t as tight as you think .
no , you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re like ... thick .
you and i are tight .
not anymore .
i think it &apos;s about time
you found another place to hang out .
hello .
hi .
are you emily thorne ?
who are you ?
melissa andetson with the &quot; times . &quot;
i &apos;m doing a story on your neighbor , the graysons ,
and i understand you &apos;re dating their son .
did he tell you that ?
no , but it &apos;s my job to dig a little .
you know , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m really not interested
in participating .
oh , come on .
my sources tell me that you &apos;re secretly anxious
to let the whole world know that daniel grayson &apos;s yours .
tyler ?
well , a good reporter never reveals her sources .
what can i say ? you got me .
please , sit down .
thank you .
your friend is a bit of a miracle .
i &apos;ve seen people fall 10 feet and not make it .
what &apos;s the prognosis ?
well , her vitals are strong
and her fractures are healing nicely .
if the swelling continues to recede ,
she could regain consciousness at anytime .
anything to expect when she does ?
oh , i &apos;d hate to speculate .
how is she ?
get a guard , quickly .
victoria , it &apos;s me .
forgive me if i don &apos;t find that
all that reassuring .
well , you stopped taking my calls .
i &apos;m going upstate for a few days .
if i were you , i &apos;d go a lot farther than that .
he &apos;s right in here .
escort this man out of the building .
if he returns , call the police .
sir .
won &apos;t be necessary .
i &apos;m gonna redeem myself with you , victoria .
or i &apos;m gonna die trying .
all right .
the moment i laid eyes on her ,
i knew emily thorne didn &apos;t belong in here .
you don &apos;t think that
stabbing her foster father with a pair of scissors
justified incarceration ?
the man was convicted of aggravated child battery
long after emily &apos;s release ,
so it was self @-@ defense .
if that &apos;s true , i &apos;d like to cross @-@ check my intel
with your records .
then get a court order .
in the meantime ,
how would you like a tour of the new library ?
it &apos;s built entirely
on emily &apos;s donations .
sure .
we took good care of emily back in the day .
now she &apos;s returning the favor . you &apos;ll see .
hey , jack .
the stowaway &apos;s in the &quot; times . &quot;
what ?
yeah .
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m serious .
it &apos;s this crazy article about the graysons .
well , okay , listen to this .
uh , &quot; in an effort to become a more well @-@ rounded person
&quot; and experience the life of the other half ,
&quot; daniel grayson has even taken a job tending bar
at local tavern the stowaway . &quot;
what else does it say ?
it &apos;s garbage .
hey , i forgot to tell you , i &apos;m taking the night off .
oh , are you ?
thanks , brother .
how was your swim ?
rough . this one &apos;s part dolphin .
what you got there ?
oh , a little gift for you two ,
hot off the presses .
wait . i thought you weren &apos;t doing the interview .
yeah , well , the reporter showed up at my house ,
so i didn &apos;t have much choice .
well , how did she even know about you ?
apparently , somebody told her
that i was anxious to participate .
wait . ty , is this true ?
i wanted to do something nice for you .
things have been bumpy with emily and me ,
and i thought it would be a good peace offering .
sure you did .
excuse me .
danny , come on .
i didn &apos;t mean any harm .
it &apos;s getting harder and harder to believe .
if you can &apos;t start respecting what i got going on with emily ,
then maybe you shouldn &apos;t be here .
did you get rid of him ?
for now , but this never should &apos;ve happened .
what &apos;s the first thing i taught you ?
never underestimate your enemy .
and never let your guard down .
this one seems determined .
won &apos;t happen again .
thanks , ms. stiles .
so how do you like your article ?
&quot; with a strength to
withstand the passage of time
and a sparkling polish that won &apos;t quit ,
silver is the perfect fit
for the graysons &apos; own brand of marital bliss . &quot;
i &apos;d be happier if this couple bore any resemblance to us .
i just hope our children have better luck .
i thought you didn &apos;t believe in luck .
i don &apos;t believe in good luck .
i &apos;m sure lydia would agree
if she were able .
oh , speaking of , i find it curious
you took it upon yourself to pay her hospital bills .
why the 180 ?
well , it &apos;s easy to blame lydia
for what &apos;s happened between us .
the truth is , we &apos;re not all that different .
when i met you 25 years ago ,
you were married ,
and i was lonely and insecure , just like lydia .
that &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t recall you ever
being either of those things .
and for the record ,
i really never have loved any woman
the way i &apos;ve loved you .
just my luck .
i thought you might come here .
stop following me , frank .
you stop giving me a reason to .
the feds are coming for david tomorrow night .
what &apos;s done is done .
now you made your decision , victoria .
the sooner you start living with it , the better .
what , no bodyguard ?
i &apos;m right here , ma &apos;am .
we came over to do a ...
security check on your place .
ed found at least seven points of entry
for potential intruders .
you really should let him install a security system .
we also do panic rooms .
i don &apos;t panic .
ed , would you give us a minute ?
i need to speak to the young lady .
what happened to flying under the radar , princess ?
tyler sicced that reporter on me .
i had to spin it to my advantage .
you were so effusive about daniel ,
even i swooned .
jack , on the other hand ,
not so much .
now he &apos;s taking it out on me .
okay , you know what ?
i don &apos;t have time to deal with your problems , nolan .
i have too many of my own .
what ?
shark in the water a little too close to shore ?
not frank .
tyler .
he is doing everything he can to come between daniel and me .
i need you
to find something for me to use
to discredit him with the graysons .
my first solo takedown ?
i &apos;m on it .
all right , two mojitos , one cosmo ,
one sugar @-@ free margarita .
enjoy .
jack .
could i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
unless you &apos;re planning on ordering a shaved ice appletini .
i &apos;ve noticed ,
the clientele &apos;s shifted a bit
since the last time i was here .
yeah , yeah .
thanks , again , daniel grayson .
not that i &apos;m complaining .
business has been good .
well , i wanted to bring you this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s an old mariner &apos;s compass .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
well , i wanted to , to say thank you
for fixing the swing .
and about the other night ...
can we pretend that didn &apos;t happen ?
i &apos;m still pretty embarrassed about that .
don &apos;t be .
friends ?
friends .
i &apos;ll see you later .
thank you .
thanks again for inviting me to be your date tonight .
finally , i get to be on the guest list
instead of checking it at the door .
of course . you earned it .
i &apos;ve earned a new pair of shoes , too ,
don &apos;t you think ?
go . i &apos;ll wait out here .
well , well .
don &apos;t you two make a cute couple ?
you should probably get outta here .
my girl can &apos;t stand you .
well , if ashley doesn &apos;t want to see me ,
she should take out a restraining order .
you have some experience with that , right ?
what are you talking about ?
oh , right .
the restraining order was against you .
my mistake .
perhaps ...
leslie montgomery
could shed some light on the matter .
what do you want , nolan ?
i &apos;ll explain it to you tonight .
my place ,
7 @-@ ish .
yeah , well , uh , i won &apos;t be there .
you will and you &apos;ll be prompt .
i can be a very impatient person .
hello , emily thorne .
our wedding invitation . how nice .
i tracked down the printer who did the original
and had one made for you .
with daniel &apos;s help , of course .
ah , don &apos;t look at me . this was all emily .
how extraordinarily crafty of you .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
well , as long as we &apos;re giving gifts ,
happy anniversary , mrs. g.
i &apos;m declan .
charlotte invited me .
oh , she did , did she ?
ah , rose . how lovely .
charlotte .
mom , you remember declan .
he &apos;s my plus one .
well , i &apos;ll just have mrs. johnson
set another place at the table .
you didn &apos;t tell her i was coming ?
must have slipped her mind .
tyler &apos;s not here . declan can have his seat .
oh , he &apos;s just running a bit late .
well , we &apos;ll just hold the first course for him , then .
let &apos;s start without him . he can catch up .
yeah , you wouldn &apos;t want your food to get cold , mrs. grayson .
i &apos;m sure you slaved in the kitchen all day .
you &apos;re funny .
scotch okay ?
just tell me what the hell you want .
direct .
i like that in my negotiations .
well , upon some research ,
i noticed that all your bills last summer
were paid by one leslie montgomery ,
kept @-@ boy style .
i get it . older women can be so hot .
then i discovered that
leslie had filed a restraining order against you .
seems you made leslie , uh ...
a very nervous man .
tell me ,
what &apos;s a gay hustler doing posing as a harvard student ?
gay ? eh .
a hustler ?
maybe .
ambiguous sexual identity .
i get it .
i &apos;m about a ...
3 on the kinsey scale myself .
still doesn &apos;t explain what you &apos;re up to .
although , it &apos;s no surprise you ended up best buds with daniel grayson .
okay .
a couple of years ago , my family lost everything .
the barrols went from the penthouse to the street
overnight .
i was forced to drop out of school ,
and now i &apos;m here ,
edging my way into an entry @-@ level job
with conrad grayson .
and i imagine your chances for landing that job
would take a nosedive if conrad knew about your past .
all right , nolan .
you got me .
but tell me ...
who gets you ?
excuse me ?
well , you--you &apos;d think
there &apos;d be people crawling all over you .
but here you are ,
all alone .
now then , i can &apos;t have you sharing all this .
you did say this was a negotiation , so ...
let &apos;s make a deal .
still no answer from tylr . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll just see myself out .
oh , ashley , don &apos;t be silly . please .
that doesn &apos;t sound like the tyler i know .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s an explanation .
always .
the &quot; times &quot; piece on your marriage
was really inspiring .
what you two have is
truly worth the attention .
i thought it was chock @-@ full of embellishments .
surely what they wrote about you and daniel
was equally overblown .
oh , i couldn &apos;t bring myself to read that part about us .
that &apos;s funny . neither could my brother .
emily &apos;s trying to get over a case of publicity shyness .
well , when she &apos;s ready , she can take my spot .
after all this ,
i &apos;ll be happy if i never see my name in print again .
i &apos;ll believe that when i see it . or rather , when i don &apos;t see it .
how about a toast ?
to the hamptons &apos; very own william and kate .
oh . we &apos;re not exactly royalty .
no kidding .
the duke of cambridge wouldn &apos;t be caught dead
working at a dive bar .
it &apos;s not a dive bar , sir .
declan &apos;s right , mr. grayson .
the stowaway is more of a local treasure .
oh , i didn &apos;t know you frequented such places , emily .
oh , yeah .
in fact , she was there this afternoon .
she even gave him a present .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
i was thanking him for fixing the porch swing .
it was nothing .
yeah , it wasn &apos;t nothing to him .
you don &apos;t know what it took for jack
to put himself out there for you on the 4th .
you let him think he had a shot ,
but he never did ,
because in your mind ,
he will never be good enough for you people .
now i know the feeling .
sorry , charlotte .
excuse me .
daniel .
i think i &apos;ll try tyler again . excuse me .
congratulations , mom ,
and happy anniversary .
it &apos;s $ 50 for the lap dance .
hands to yourself , or i use the cuffs .
or not .
actually , um ,
i just want to talk .
ah , you &apos;re one of those .
it &apos;s your money .
what do you want to talk about ?
i want to talk about amanda clarke for starters .
great . another reporter .
do i look like a reporter ?
you look like a cop .
so do you .
okay , you caught me .
&quot; time &quot; magazine &apos;s daughter of the devil , in the flesh .
and if this is your going rate for talking ,
i &apos;ll tell you anything you want to hear .
i want to hear the truth .
your name &apos;s not really amanda clarke , is it ?
it &apos;s emily thorne .
one minute you &apos;re gushing about me to the &quot; times , &quot;
the next you &apos;re having a romantic night
under the fireworks with jack ?
it wasn &apos;t like that , daniel .
well , it sure sounds like that .
and why wouldn &apos;t you tell me
you went to see him again today ?
because i didn &apos;t think it mattered .
jack and i are just friends . you know that .
a while ago , i promised you ,
i &apos;d be honest with you no matter what .
i thought we both did .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just scared .
scared ?
scared of what ?
i &apos;m falling in love with you .
i need to take a walk .
we &apos;re drowning in lies , all of us .
not even our children can escape
the wreckage from this arrangement .
arrangement ?
what do you-- you mean our marriage ?
this isn &apos;t a marriage .
and i &apos;m not sure it ever was .
clearly not for you , ever .
i remember the way you used to look at david clarke .
you have never , not once , looked at me like that--
not before and certainly not after .
you have never given me reason to !
well , perhaps i should count myself as lucky .
i mean , look what happened to him .
get out !
with pleasure .
excuse me . yeah , excuse me .
yeah , yeah .
i can &apos;t stand these people .
dinner didn &apos;t go as planned ?
well , that depends on whose plan , you know .
look , i &apos;m clearly not an expert ,
but i do know that you can &apos;t be certain
how someone feels about you
until they tell you themselves .
you should talk to her .
well , i can &apos;t go back there .
looks like you won &apos;t have to .
so here &apos;s the way that i see it--
the girl passing herself off as emily thorne ,
needed a new identity .
and who better than her orphan cell mate ,
straight outta juvie ?
i &apos;m sure she gave you
what seemed like a lot of money at the time ,
but money runs out ,
and then you end up in a place like this .
am i close ?
something like that .
so here &apos;s what i don &apos;t understand--
why keep the name ?
why prolong the charade ?
when i became amanda , i became somebody .
you &apos;re not the first one to come in
looking for amanda clarke .
though most of them were perverts .
when was the last time you had contact with her ?
years .
i &apos;ve tried to find her at least a dozen times .
where is she ?
who &apos;s daniel grayson ?
heir to multibillion @-@ dollar fortune
and my employer &apos;s son .
does anyone else know you found me ?
not yet .
my shift &apos;s over in an hour .
meet me in the parking lot ?
i thought maybe you could use this .
enjoy this fleeting moment , daniel .
it &apos;ll be the only time i &apos;ll admit
your tending bar isn &apos;t a complete waste .
not exactly the anniversary dinner
we had planned .
well , things didn &apos;t go exactly as planned
for either of us , did they ?
true .
things with emily haven &apos;t been easy .
i just ... i can &apos;t stop thinking about her , mom .
why don &apos;t you like her ?
i just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
allowing yourself to fall for someone
comes at the risk of a painful price .
i guess it &apos;s true what they say .
you can &apos;t really choose who you fall in love with .
i love you , mom .
i love you , too , baby .
david clarke knew exactly what he was doing .
on numerous occasions ,
he told me he was working on something big .
and th @-@ that he wanted me to run away with him .
no .
david clarke has to be completely dead to you ,
or the jury will see right through you .
victoria ...
we &apos;re gonna lose everything--
this house , daniel ...
i mean , everything .
david clarke threatened my life .
if i didn &apos;t do what he wanted ,
he swore he would hurt my family as well .
i did what i had to do to protect them .
i only wish i could &apos;ve done the same
for the people who died in that plane .
hello .
victoria , i &apos;m so glad you answered .
where are you , frank ?
i &apos;m on my way back to you .
your suspicions were right all along .
emily thorne is not who she claims to--
frank ?
frank , are you there ?
frank ?
frank ?
frank ?
one bloody rose ? pathetic .
it was just a dinner .
not to me .
ever since i &apos;ve got here ,
all i &apos;ve wanted is to be a player in the scenes ,
not lurking behind them .
so the ...
whole loyal employee thing is just an act ?
my loyalties lie with ashley .
i have to make a name for myself .
i don &apos;t get to sit on my ass
and watch my inheritance grow
like every other spoiled 20 @-@ something around here ,
yourself included .
ash , you &apos;ve got me all wrong .
my father &apos;s company is bankrupt ,
and my family &apos;s been dealing with massive debt .
i &apos;m their only hope of rebuilding .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me that ?
because i was afraid you &apos;d tell them .
well , you see how these people are .
they smell blood in the water , and you &apos;re as good as dead .
that still doesn &apos;t explain why you stood me up .
i went to conrad &apos;s office in the city tonight ,
and i made copies of his confidential database .
this time next year ,
he won &apos;t make a single decision without consulting me .
i &apos;ll be indispensible .
ambitious .
we &apos;re more alike than i thought .
tell me the truth ,
you invited me tonight just to piss off your mother .
okay . part of me did , yeah .
but the only reason tonight was bearable
was because you were sitting next to me .
is that so ?
you &apos;re just gonna have to accept that i like you .
you &apos;re funny and you &apos;re cute
and you voice your opinion .
well , that &apos;s not gonna change .
good .
you &apos;re probably the first person under that roof
to ever be completely honest .
i thought it was hot .
oh , yeah ?
tyler never showed up for dinner .
i &apos;m impressed .
how &apos;d you do it ?
well , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
i took a page from the angel of revenge herself ,
dug up some dirt ,
used it for leverage .
what &apos;s the dirt ?
suffice it to say ,
our boy is a bit of a con man .
what he doesn &apos;t know is , you can &apos;t con a con .
emily ?
whatever you &apos;re doing , keep it up .
oh ... i plan to .
sleep tight .
remember how we met ?
how could i forget ?
i spilled a drink all over your jacket .
yes , you did .
i never had that jacket cleaned .
yeah , i , uh ...
i hung it in my closet to remind me
that unpredictable moments can change your life
if you &apos;re ready for them .
i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m falling in love with you , too .
just as there are two sides to every story ,
there are two sides to every person .
one that we reveal to the world ,
and another we keep hidden inside .
a duality governed
by the balance of light and darkness .
conrad .
within each of us is the capacity
for both good and evil .
but those who are able to blur the moral dividing line
hold the true power .
oh , god . it &apos;s really you .
amanda clarke ?
the way they &apos;ve been talking about you ,
i expected someone ...
bigger .
not afraid of me ?
you should be .
you obviously know who i am .
who are you ?
emily .
emily what ?
emily thorne .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
some guy named frank figured out we switched names .
where is he ?
don &apos;t worry . i took care of him .
this is his phone .
victoria grayson keeps calling .
you &apos;ve reached frank . leave a message .
frank , it &apos;s victoria .
you officially have me worried .
please call me back as soon as you get this .
what do you mean emily thorne is not
