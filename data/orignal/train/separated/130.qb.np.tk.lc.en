总监 夕橙橙
第七季 第十集
brian ...
it &apos;s cary .
thanks for pulling an all @-@ nighter .
um , ethan carver &apos;s coming in an hour earlier today ,
so we should meet up at 6 : 00 a.m. sharp .
cedric , i just left a message for brian .
i &apos;m not sure if you guys went home to take a shower
or crashed on the 27th floor ,
but i got donuts up here on the 28th .
where the hell is my defendant ?
your honor ...
oh , how i love to hear those two words .
but , mrs. florrick , if the next word out of your mouth
isn &apos;t &quot; right here &quot; or &quot; dead , &quot;
then i will be very upset .
he &apos;s in surgery .
is that the 21st @-@ century equivalent of &quot; my dog ate my homework &quot; ?
no , he &apos;s literally in surgery .
really ?
that &apos;s one of those words that doesn &apos;t often mean &quot; literally . &quot;
for example , i am literally thunderstruck .
was he in an accident ?
no , sir . he &apos;s performing the operation .
ah , all is becoming clear to me now .
your client is a surgeon and he has scheduled surgery
on the day he &apos;s supposed to be in court with me .
no , your honor , the surgery went long .
dr. portnow is one of the best cardiac surgeons in the country .
and on trial for criminal conspiracy .
and he is in the middle
of operating on a four @-@ month @-@ old baby ...
a jury &apos;s been empanelled .
yes .
and my client has had this baby on the table with her chest open
for the past five hours .
your honor , this is obscene . it &apos;s staged .
this surgery was intended to go long
so you would wonder how a doctor could do such villainous things .
that is not true , matan .
that &apos;s exactly ...
the surgery went two hours longer ...
wait ! wait !
mrs. florrick , your client
had an appearance time of 10 : 00 a.m.
now , i don &apos;t know if this was staged or not ,
but i will treat your client like he was any other .
i am issuing a warrant for dr. portnow .
your honor , this is ...
sheriff , please arrest dr. portnow
as soon as he puts down his scalpel .
... have any warning ?
have to figure out what the damage is .
did anybody have any warning ?
... have to use my cell phone ?
just a minute . please . cary .
who is it ? who left ?
the devil &apos;s spawn .
seriously , david .
what , you &apos;re worried about offending them ?
cary , could you join us here ?
yes , can we talk about the idiots you hired ?
hey , i didn &apos;t hire them by myself .
well , i was only convinced because you were saying ... - i won &apos;t take the blame ...
stop it ! that &apos;s enough !
is there anybody left , cary ?
from dipple &apos;s team ?
no .
typical ivy league morons .
let &apos; em in the door , they foment a rebellion .
all young associates are snakes .
and you wonder why they walked out .
you &apos;re not seriously blaming us ?
they just wanted good work .
which we gave them .
grudgingly .
and only because they were willing
to bust their asses on a highly technical case .
hold on . you got dipple &apos;s man .
how long can i say to get this filed ?
just a few hours . i put together the strategy .
the associates just ground out the filing and the exhibits .
good .
wait .
when you and alicia stole our clients ...
we didn &apos;t steal your clients .
... didn &apos;t you purge ongoing work product from our computers ?
i &apos;ll check .
listen .
we have hundreds of pages of scientific explanations and diagrams ...
i &apos;ll check .
&quot; aamof . &quot; what is that ?
&quot; as a matter of fact . &quot;
mr. carver , how are you ?
you know what i hate about acronyms ?
they make you do all the work .
it &apos;s not an acronym .
an acronym has to form another word .
like nato .
really ?
we &apos;re arguing even before we say hello ?
i said hello .
mr. dipple is impressed you &apos;re willing to take this on .
go out on a limb-- that &apos;s where the fruit is .
so i can tell mr. dipple we &apos;re set to file ?
um ... just give me one minute .
they wiped them clean .
everything , all of their work product .
we need to talk , cary .
i &apos;m not falling on my sword
for hiring people that everybody wanted ...
that &apos;s not what this is about .
you turned it into a generational fight ...
it is a generational fight .
... which blinded you to the fact that they played you .
they played you , cary .
no . no , you know what i see ?
i see you , david , howard and a half @-@ dozen other partners
froze the associates out .
that &apos;s a complete misrepresentation . and no matter why this happened ,
you need to make it right , cary .
now .
the thought of you in here with no view depresses me .
this is an l.a. artist , jose ramirez .
it &apos;s a little big .
i wanted you to be swallowed up in it .
oh , that won &apos;t be a problem .
so how are we ?
are we good ?
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s weird to be dating a billionaire .
not a billionaire .
$ 185 million .
you going to see ruth ?
yeah .
she wants to talk about alicia .
yes .
tell her i handled it .
i need your help , ms. paige .
with the campaign ?
yes , in a way .
alicia florrick has an investigator in her law firm .
jason crouse ?
are you worried something untoward &apos;s going on
between the two of them ?
how did you know ?
well , eli said there wasn &apos;t .
yes , eli has a way of not wanting to face facts--
at least not with alicia .
are they having an affair ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but ...
well , what can i do ?
hello .
hello . is this jason crouse ?
it might be . who &apos;s this ?
courtney paige , mr. crouse .
i &apos;m looking for an investigator , and you come highly recommended .
well , that &apos;s good news .
from who ?
someone i &apos;d rather not name .
are you available ?
that depends .
how does $ 50,000 sound ?
for two months &apos; work .
good morning .
how &apos;d you find us ?
where &apos;s the brief ?
don &apos;t you want to know why we left ?
no .
i want the brief .
it &apos;s nothing personal .
we like you .
we just ... don &apos;t want to be like you .
i don &apos;t give a damn .
give me back the brief .
there is no brief . we never started it .
you erased the files .
i could file a criminal suit for spoliation .
come on , cary .
you know we &apos;re too smart for that .
that &apos;s why you hired us , right ?
brian made sure we didn &apos;t look
at anything in dipple &apos;s files .
pretty much put up our chinese wall .
you avoided conflicting yourselves out , so ... so what ?
so you could start your own firm ?
no . you told us how hard that was .
we &apos;re going to canning .
canning represents dipple &apos;s opponent .
he wants us .
god ...
you are the devil &apos;s spawn .
be humble .
apologize for missing the start of the trial .
tell the judge you recognize the authority of this court ,
that this will never happen again .
well , well .
who do we have here ?
your honor , dr. portnow is present .
i &apos;d like to apologize , your honor .
i was in surgery ...
i can see that .
the scrubs are a really nice touch .
that was not our choice , your honor .
he was arrested and ...
okay , sir .
your bail has been revoked .
your honor !
no , the three of you chose theatrics over my valuable time .
i don &apos;t care who you are , sir , or what your reputation is .
far as i &apos;m concerned , you &apos;re a defendant ,
charged with conspiring to kidnap , sedate and rape a woman .
and to make sure dr. portnow isn &apos;t too busy
or distracted to make his court dates ,
he &apos;ll be placed in the care of
the cook county department of corrections .
just until we get this rescheduled .
whenever that may be .
your honor ,
i have patients lined up-- a newborn with
hypoplastic left heart syndrome .
sheriffs !
your honor , a moment of your time , please ?
no , mrs. florrick , another time .
actually , sir , i think now is a good time .
i &apos;m sure you know as well as i , ma &apos;am , this is an ex parte conversation .
yes , but i don &apos;t think you would want the court to be aware
that you are using personal bias
to penalize my client .
really ?
what personal bias ?
bias against me .
your client is accused of conspiring to rape
the mother of one of his patients .
i &apos;m not sure how our relationship figures into this .
what ?
i &apos;m waiting .
you were bribed , sir .
excuse me ?
the fbi targeted you for a bribe .
yeah .
they targeted me .
that means nothing .
i didn &apos;t take it .
because eli gold warned you .
get out of here .
your honor , all i &apos;m asking for is fairness .
i said get out of here , ma &apos;am .
now .
i said now !
警告
it &apos;s the splash page for brutalmercy.com.
it &apos;s an online meeting place for people with dark sexual fetishes--
rape , torture , sexual humiliation .
and was the defendant active on this site ?
he was .
over the course of eight months , he logged in 182 times .
and was he just a lurker ...
i just want the jury to see me touch you
so you don &apos;t look like a threat .
now nod .
... commented on other people &apos;s posts , but then , on june 23,
he posted a photo of a woman
we i.d. &apos; d as lucy van gaal .
can you read the message
he attached to the first of these photos ?
&quot; can &apos;t get this one off my mind .
tasty target . ksr anyone &quot;
and do you know what &quot; ksr &quot; means ?
i do .
it &apos;s used on the site for &quot; kidnap , sedate , rape . &quot;
did anyone respond to dr. portnow ?
yes , another user , ortolan246 .
he wrote he was &quot; up for the ksr , &quot;
and then they set up a private chat .
and how specific were they ?
extremely .
they worked out how the defendant was going to kidnap ms. van gaal ,
what he would use to sedate her ,
what the two of them wanted to do to her sexually .
your honor , i &apos;d like to enter 211
of the defendant &apos;s posts as evidence .
objection . the sheer volume is prejudicial .
they &apos;re directly relevant to proving the first element
of the conspiracy : the defendant &apos;s
agreement with ortolan to do something illegal .
if you &apos;d rather , mrs. florrick ,
we can read into the record ,
and i &apos;ll rule on them one by one .
so , for a number of months ,
you tracked the defendant &apos;s plan to kidnap ,
sedate and rape lucy van gaal .
but how did you decide when to arrest him ?
we waited until the night before he was going to abduct her .
he had just been online , finalizing the plan
with ortolan .
can you tell us
what they agreed to ?
ortolan said he was
gonna call in sick to the bank he worked at
in tampa and then drive overnight to chicago .
while the defendant kidnapped ms. van gaal ,
ortolan was responsible for arranging a place
where they could take her and rape her undisturbed .
and did you find any real @-@ world evidence
consistent with that plan ?
in the trunk of the defendant &apos;s car--
rubber tubing , syringes , propofol ,
which matched exactly what he described in his posts .
there has to be an easier way .
the easier way walked out the door this morning .
oh , come on , this is fun .
first case i ever worked on was a patent .
for what , the wheel ?
they went over to canning .
you &apos;re kidding .
did you get back their work product ?
they sandbagged us .
they never did a thing .
we &apos;re dead in the water .
no .
we have to pull this together .
what , in three and a half hours ?
how much time do you think we need ?
a week to find new associates .
another week to figure out what the hell this is .
i need to come clean with carver .
i could call the judge .
you know nico terzzi ?
yeah .
can ask him for some breathing room
on this filing deadline .
and i &apos;ll go get us some help .
detective , do you remember how dr. portnow
said he had selected ms. van gaal ?
yes , he said she was a passenger
on a recent flight he &apos;d piloted .
was that true ?
what do you mean ?
were dr. portnow
and ms. van gaal on a flight together ?
i don &apos;t believe so .
you don &apos;t believe so ? didn &apos;t you check it ?
i did .
so don &apos;t you know it not to be true ?
i do .
so it was all just a fantasy , right ?
that part was .
well , what about his plan ?
you called the tubing , the syringes and propofol evidence ,
but aren &apos;t those reasonable things for a surgeon to have ?
i found it unusual he had them in the trunk of his car .
even though dr. portnow
explained how medical device company reps
often give him samples
and he just tosses them in his car ?
he did say that , yes .
so dr. portnow created a fantasy
where he was a pilot ,
which he &apos;s not ,
and lucy van gaal was a passenger , which she wasn &apos;t .
and he talked about using tools that turned out to be
leftover medical supplies ...
objection , judge .
detective rodriguez is supposed to be testifying ,
not mrs. florrick .
sustained .
detective , dr. portnow wrote some
upsetting things online .
but he never kidnapped or sedated
or raped anyone , did he ?
no , but that &apos;s because we stopped him before he could .
thank you so much , detective . we appreciate you testifying .
how &apos;s it going ?
skeptical jury ,
skeevy client-- harder than it should be
with someone who &apos;s not guilty .
all right , what can i do to help ?
check out the dark fetish web site .
find out if anyone on there has ever committed an actual crime .
congratulations , there &apos;s a lot of weird porn in your future .
i may have to raise my rate .
i didn &apos;t realize you were such a prude .
i &apos;ve been offered $ 200 an hour .
diane wants you that bad ?
no .
courtney paige .
she wants to hire you ?
someplace out of town .
san jose .
yep . that &apos;s eli &apos;s doing .
he &apos;s worried about us .
the offer was for two months .
i can &apos;t beat $ 200 .
i know .
we want to offer you the job .
you do ?
um , look , we made a mistake not hiring you
the first time around , but , uh ,
i thought we worked
well together on chumhum .
and that &apos;s why you want me back ?
because we worked well together ?
yes , of course .
i want the same salary the other associates were getting ,
and 250 protected pro bono hours .
dr. portnow was my hero .
bella &apos;s had three open heart surgeries ,
and dr. portnow was there every step of the way .
so when did you first become aware of your role
in the defendant &apos;s rape fantasies ?
after he was arrested ,
detective rodriguez showed me the things he posted on that web site .
could you please read this ?
objection . your honor ,
these posts are already in evidence .
ms. van gaal &apos;s interpretation of the posts
is necessary to establish their relationship .
he &apos;s reaching .
i disagree . overruled .
we &apos;re ready .
i know where that bitch lives ,
and she worships me , so this won &apos;t be hard .
just need to get her alone .
once i stick her with the sedative ,
it &apos;s seconds till she twilights ,
then i &apos;ll take her limp body ...
i can &apos;t read this .
that post is from october 23 .
the next day , october 24,
did the defendant call you ?
he said he was checking up on bella .
but when you told him you were home alone ,
that bella was out at a play date ,
did he ask if he could come by anyway ?
he said he &apos;d be in the neighborhood .
and if he hadn &apos;t been arrested and had stopped by ,
you wouldn &apos;t have hesitated to let him in , would you ?
in all the times you were with dr. portnow ,
did he ever say or do anything inappropriate ?
no , never .
you always found him to be a good physician
and a caring person ?
i thought so , but ...
lucy , october 24 wasn &apos;t the first time
dr. portnow called to check up on bella , was it ?
no .
do you remember his calls to you
on june 13 , july 11and july 25 ?
not specifically ,
but bella had a surgery during the summer .
are you aware that dr. portnow posted on the fetish web site
that he went to your house on those days ?
no .
so he may have had fantasies about you ,
but he never acted on any of them , did he ?
i guess not .
i don &apos;t know if i want to win this one .
why , cause you think he did it ?
i mean , intended to do it ?
i don &apos;t know .
but when you fantasize about something that much ,
i don &apos;t think it makes a difference .
yet there are 50 children alive today because of him .
yeah , and if we lose , there will be hundreds more
who won &apos;t live because he &apos;ll be in prison .
it &apos;s odd .
that someone can be so good ,
yet think things so bad .
it &apos;s people .
they &apos;re all scum .
damaged much ?
no , observant .
don &apos;t expect anything of anybody
and you &apos;ll never be disappointed .
that &apos;s a sad way to live .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
you and i are just sitting here , having a pleasant drink .
but i don &apos;t expect anything of you ,
and you don &apos;t expect anything of me .
still , i &apos;m not gonna kill you .
not yet , anyway .
bourbon neat , please .
good time on the fetish site ?
ha @-@ ha . talked to a buddy in cybercrimes ,
said they &apos;ve never had a case of someone on the brutal mercy site
actually committing a crime .
good . that helps .
but ?
but he is familiar with the case
because cpd is working it alongside the s.a. &apos; s office .
they have tracked down ortolan246 .
the banker who shared portnow &apos;s fantasy .
yeah , actually , he &apos;s a registered sex offender in milwaukee ,
and he is testifying for the prosecution .
damn .
alicia , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
listen , i don &apos;t want to leave you in the lurch ,
but i &apos;m on a plane tomorrow .
i can delay a week
if you want me to finish this out .
no , you shouldn &apos;t .
okay .
good luck .
how long will you be gone ?
couple months .
i ...
i understand if i don &apos;t have a job when i come back .
will you call me ?
um ... when you get back .
sure .
you ever spent any time in northern california ?
enough .
too much fleece , too many ironic beards .
good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , alicia .
oh , monica , there you are .
appendix to the federal rules .
i flagged form 18 .
i still need the conforming examples ...
not until you get me on the phone
with the egghead from chicago polytech .
i tracked down professor kennedy &apos;s secretary .
she is waking him .
monica , is form 18 ... ?
it &apos;s a template for simplified pleading .
we don &apos;t need more than that .
hey . if you want to grab a quick nap ...
when this is over .
i ... didn &apos;t want to eat this .
we &apos;re not gonna make this filing deadline , are we ?
no .
where are you going ?
we need more bodies .
manny hofstadter ,
aka ortolan246 .
are you a convicted sex offender , mr. hofstadter ?
you could say that .
and what is your occupation ?
trucker , long @-@ haul .
that &apos;s an isolating life , isn &apos;t it ?
i guess you could also say that .
so when you &apos;re driving and you stop for the night ,
what do you do ?
ah , hang out in the back of my rig , read some .
mostly go online .
do you visit a lot of fetish sites ?
used to .
then i really got into brutal mercy .
which is where you connected with the defendant .
yeah , thealgea .
yeah , that &apos;s his screen name .
the greek spirits of pain and suffering .
i liked that .
you also liked his plan to ksr lucy van gaal .
i did . i still do .
it wasn &apos;t just a fantasy for you ?
i was all set to go through with it .
so was thealgea .
objection !
speculation !
whoa , whoa , whoa . one at a time .
speculation , your honor .
sustained . the jury will disregard the comment about
what the defendant did or did not intend to do .
does it change your opinion
to know thealgea wasn &apos;t a pilot ?
nah , we all use fake online personas .
feeds the fantasy .
so what made you think this time was more than just fantasy ?
i could tell thealgea really knew lucy ,
and the plan he had , uh , it wasn &apos;t just made @-@ up kink .
it was too real .
and i wanted in .
your sex offender status ,
is that the result of any violent or nonconsensual crime ?
nah , i got popped a few times with lot lizards .
you solicited prostitutes ?
like he said ,
road &apos;s a lonely place .
and in exchange for your testimony today ,
your most recent solicitation charge was dropped , wasn &apos;t it ?
oh , yeah .
before today , before you walked into this room ,
you &apos;d never even seen dr. portnow before , had you ?
never .
did you have a phone number for him ? or an e @-@ mail ?
he didn &apos;t give them to me .
so even though you had no way of connecting in the real world ,
you still thought you two were going through with this plan ?
we were gonna use the site .
he was supposed to put up a post
that had the word &quot; hooked &quot; in it when he grabbed up lucy .
but did you actually arrange a place ?
yeah .
that &apos;s odd .
your company driving records show you were out of state this whole time .
objection , your honor .
not in evidence .
that &apos;s right .
i think lucca wants to put it into evidence .
yes , your honor . here &apos;s his cargo manifest .
so how were you planning to participate
all the way from santa fe , new mexico ;
bakersfield , california ; and santa cruz ?
i could get back .
really ? 2,965 miles , a drive that would take four days .
if he &apos;d have written me ,
i would &apos;ve driven back .
yes , and your cargo of fresh fruit and vegetables--
i guess you &apos;d just drop those beside the road .
yeah , if he had written me .
all right .
sure .
stick with that .
objection .
sustained .
jason .
how are you ?
good . heading out .
northern california , here i come .
you &apos;re relocating ?
for a while .
hey , if you see alicia ,
tell her i left something for her .
sure . where ?
she &apos;ll know .
eli .
hi .
oh , hey , courtney .
what &apos;s up ?
what are you doing ?
nothing , nothing .
just waiting for your call .
do you have time to see me tonight ?
well , i didn &apos;t until you asked .
how does 8 : 15 sound ?
that &apos;s very specific .
well , i &apos;m a specific kind of girl .
okay , i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 16 .
i &apos;m demonstrating my independence by being late .
see you then .
bye .
eli .
alicia , hi . how are you ?
what do you need ?
i &apos;ve come to talk to you about something slightly sensitive .
jackie and howard .
尽快与之交谈
is everything all right ?
what ?
yeah , what do you need ?
peter thinks she should have a prenup .
who ?
jackie ... and howard .
eli , i don &apos;t give a single damn .
why are you in my life , eli ?
why am i ... ?
yes , why are you telling my investigator to go move to silicon valley ?
why are ... ?
i didn &apos;t .
why are you letting your paranoia rule my business ?
alicia , wait .
no , seriously .
eli , i have been very fluid
with the lines between your needs and mine , but we &apos;re done .
alicia , i haven &apos;t done anything .
he &apos;s going to work for courtney paige .
i can &apos;t find a good investigator in the same price range ,
and i probably won &apos;t be able to afford him when he gets back .
and what business is it of yours
what i &apos;m doing with my private life ?
alicia ...
my life is my life , and i want you
to back the hell up !
i wasn &apos;t sleeping with jason .
but even if i was , that &apos;s my business .
it wasn &apos;t me .
i don &apos;t know how he came to courtney &apos;s attention , but ...
actually , i do know how he came to courtney &apos;s attention .
eli , leave .
it was ruth , not me .
leave , eli . i have a client .
alicia , i swear .
i don &apos;t care .
now , i have work to do .
work that will be twice as hard
because i don &apos;t have an investigator .
now leave .
so is it final ?
is what final ?
did you sign the contracts with canning ?
not yet . brian &apos;s pushing to get us a ten percent bonus
if we crack 2,500 hours .
it &apos;s all over but the shouting .
well , if it &apos;s not over over , then i have a pitch .
we &apos;re willing to offer you 20 % billables bonus
if you come back .
you serious ?
yes .
you &apos;re desperate .
maybe .
but i &apos;m willing to beat
whatever canning is offering you salary @-@ wise .
it &apos;s not just about the money , cary . we told you .
it &apos;s the lack of upward mobility , the culture .
and if we change that .
you tried already .
didn &apos;t work .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t have the leverage .
now , with the threat of dipple walking ,
i do .
can &apos;t just have idle promises .
instead of eight years to partner ,
we &apos;ll guarantee you five .
full equity .
and you pick your cases ,
no mandatory rotations .
we need it in writing .
yes , but you have to commit right now
and get back to work immediately ;
the only way this works is
we get on the dipple case right now .
how do we know you &apos;re serious about this ?
got $ 80,000 in signing bonuses to back it up .
thank you for testifying for your husband .
i know how difficult this must be ,
having to confront all of this .
things are only difficult if you don &apos;t understand them .
you understand your husband ?
he &apos;s highly compartmentalized .
most extraordinarily successful people are .
that &apos;s true .
my husband &apos;s online activities provide a safe space
where he can explore and exhaust his darker thoughts
so they don &apos;t spill over into the rest of his life .
they &apos;re a necessary release .
i know you &apos;re a therapist ...
i &apos;m a clinical psychiatrist .
right .
but we &apos;re calling you as a wife .
we want you to explain why you trust your husband ,
why the jury should , too .
because he &apos;s superlative at what he does .
he supports my professional goals
and respects my personal boundaries ,
and i extend the same courtesies to him .
okay .
but ...
we &apos;re worried , to a jury ,
this analysis could come off a bit ...
cold .
you want me to be less clinical ?
how you would be at home with your husband .
this is how i am with my husband .
she &apos;s a disaster .
what do we do ?
we need someone to explain these fantasies .
put the good doctor on the stand ?
okay , that was , uh ...
amazing .
really ?
i turned off mine .
yeah .
okay , 20 minutes .
we should get room service .
you should .
you have to go back to work ?
yeah .
you haven &apos;t got another hour ?
no .
that was fun .
yeah , it ... was .
wh ... what are we referring to ?
tonight ?
i have to get back home .
to the bay area ?
yeah .
when will you be back ?
in a while .
what &apos;s a while ?
a year ?
so that &apos;s it .
what do you mean ?
this .
between us .
oh ... eli .
no , no , no , no , no .
i know that voice .
i &apos;ve used that voice .
this was fun .
yeah .
it was fun .
like a carnival ride .
i like you .
and i like you .
so ruth got you to buy off jason crouse ?
what ?
alicia &apos;s investigator .
well , yeah .
he &apos;s coming out to work for a little while .
isn &apos;t that what you wanted , too ?
look , i &apos;m in the heat of a political campaign ,
and normally all i &apos;d be thinking about
is tracking polls and spot media ,
but right now i don &apos;t give a damn about any of it .
i don &apos;t know what this is , but i like it .
i think you &apos;re perfect .
for me .
so please don &apos;t go .
or go ... or go , but come back .
soon .
eli .
the way you feel about campaigns ,
that &apos;s the way i feel about my business .
and right now ,
that &apos;s my focus , business .
you understand that , right ?
i loved every moment of our being together .
know that .
those posts on brutal mercy-- did you write them ?
every word .
why ?
i &apos;ve asked myself that a lot ,
and the simple answer is ...
they made me feel good .
good ?
how ?
not like a good person , believe me ,
but , uh ... excited ,
and , other times ...
relaxed .
oh , it &apos;s hard to say this out loud .
but it wasn &apos;t hard to share these thoughts
with ortolan246 ?
no .
i didn &apos;t know who he was .
or where he was .
well , then , why make plans with him ?
they weren &apos;t real plans .
but they were so ... specific .
that made them seem more real .
i know how that sounds , but i needed the release .
the stress of what i do , the stakes of my job ,
can be unbearable .
but i can &apos;t just walk away .
too many people depend on me .
and the site--
it became a way for me to decompress .
and i knew it was okay because lucy was safe .
i knew i couldn &apos;t hurt her .
that &apos;s not who i am .
your honor , we ask that you lay out not just
the statutory elements of conspiracy ,
but that you give examples from specific cases ...
this is a smoke screen , your honor .
the defense wants to confuse the jury with a lot of case law .
it &apos;s the jury instructions , your honor .
i &apos;m not sure where else you instruct the jury .
they have their instructions .
the illinois pattern jury instructions .
it &apos;s a simple matter of intent .
what did dr. portnow intend to do ?
no , what constitutes a fantasy ?
if we can be convicted for our fantasies ,
we &apos;re at the start of a slippery slope .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
intent is almost always an issue in criminal cases .
whether you intend to kill
is the difference between murder and manslaughter .
thoughts matter . but to be criminal ,
thoughts have to be coupled with actions ,
and the jury needs to be clear on that .
okay . i &apos;ve decided .
the jury will be instructed on
all the statutory elements of conspiracy .
your honor ...
no . the jury needs it .
and i will hear on what legal precedents to mention .
it &apos;s weird to be back here so soon .
i &apos;m sure it is , but we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
so what do you need from us ?
our strategy on the dipple claim
is to prove infringement of core technique
and block any novel process argument .
what ?
actually , come to think of it , we don &apos;t want your help .
you &apos;re all fired .
excuse me ?
yes . diane , what do you think about that ?
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t think we need them .
what was that about ?
you just brought us here to embarrass us ?
no , you just heard about our side of the case .
now you &apos;re conflicted out of working for canning
on his side .
you can &apos;t do that .
we just did .
thank you for your service .
you can go now .
and the signing bonuses ?
they &apos;re real .
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll look too good for you
when i spread the word of how easy it was to blow you
out of a multimillion @-@ dollar claim for 80 grand .
jobs may be hard to come by .
go to hell .
oh , yes . thank you .
not that i needed it , but you just gave me cause to fire you .
gentlemen .
buh @-@ bye .
god , that was fun .
they were out less than 15 minutes .
is that a good or bad thing ?
it means the jury was swayed powerfully ,
but i have no idea if it was by the judge &apos;s instructions .
madam foreperson , do we have a verdict ?
we do , your honor .
in the matter of people vs. portnow ,
on the charge of conspiracy to commit kidnapping ...
... we find the defendant
guilty .
we find the defendant guilty .
how can i be going to jail for something that i didn &apos;t do ,
that was ... it was never gonna happen ?
we &apos;ll appeal .
that could take years .
your honor , we &apos;d like to calendar a sentencing hearing .
and , prior to sentencing ,
we ask that dr. portnow continue to be held without bail .
you &apos;re jumping the gun , matan .
ladies and gentlemen , this is the point where
i normally thank you for your service .
but i &apos;m not going to do that today .
you took an oath to render an impartial verdict ,
based on the law and the evidence .
each and every one of you violated that oath .
judge !
save it , matan .
as a matter of law ,
i find there was insufficient evidence
to support a conviction here ,
so i am vacating the jury &apos;s verdict
and entering a judgment of acquittal .
come .
mrs. florrick .
how else can i help you ?
what you did up there--
your honor ,
we earned that , right ?
that wasn &apos;t about
what i said in here earlier ?
because i didn &apos;t ...
mrs. florrick .
why don &apos;t you just say &quot; thank you &quot; ?
i have work to do . you can go .
eli , i wanted to say good @-@ bye to you .
i had a great time , and i &apos;ll miss you .
i hope you know ...
eli , i wanted to say good @-@ bye to you .
i had a great time , and i &apos;ll miss you .
i hope ...
i know .
i &apos;m packing for iowa now .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
eli , can we do this ...
i had no idea they were sending jason out of town .
okay .
and i know have been too involved
in your private matters .
okay , eli .
you &apos;re forgiven .
i have to go pack .
good night .
you seem more upset than i do .
i started to care about someone .
courtney paige ?
i don &apos;t care about a lot of people .
too much work .
i mean , too much work to make it ... work .
but i thought , this isn &apos;t so bad .
with her .
i could get used to this ?
then do .
be happy , eli .
i wanted to .
she went away .
where ?
california .
well , for how long ?
a year .
she had ...
work .
i &apos;m sorry , eli .
you &apos;re nice to me .
no . just listening .
i &apos;m sorry jason was sent away .
eli .
he &apos;s my investigator , that &apos;s all .
i know .
yeah , i know .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m telling you this , alicia ,
but i think you should be happy . call jason .
i &apos;m okay , eli .
i don &apos;t want to be in the way .
you &apos;re not . he was my investigator .
don &apos;t let the campaign get in your way .
okay , eli .
i &apos;m ... fine .
six years ago , you got a message from will gardner ,
a voice mail , and i erased it .
you were about to go onstage
and stand beside peter for his s.a. run ,
and i didn &apos;t want to hurt that .
i listened to the voice mail .
will said he loved you
and would give up everything to be with you .
and i erased it .
i never let you hear it .
and i &apos;ve been sick about it ever since .
and i don &apos;t want to stand
in the way of your happiness again .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m sorry .
get out .
