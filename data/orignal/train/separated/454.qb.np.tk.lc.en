the lesson
亚利桑那州 温斯洛
every time i wake up ...
i &apos;m disappointed ...
i didn &apos;t die .
the crappy food ,
the bedsores ...
it &apos;s bad enough being stuck with coma boy
drooling all day ,
but every time i see your face ,
i feel sorry for the woman who &apos;s gotta look at it .
mr. james , that &apos;s enough .
you probably go home , all alone ,
with a sleazy magazine and cheap chinese ,
crying yourself to sleep on your saggy couch .
you know what ?
all i have to do is turn up the morphine and you &apos;ll be dead .
you kill me ,
and i &apos;ll haunt you till the day you die .
when you wake up , you &apos;ll see my face .
when you go to work , you &apos;ll see my face .
and every time you kiss that $ 3.00 whore you call a wife ,
you &apos;ll see my face laughing at you .
laughing at you ,
as she lays there pretending to enjoy it ,
when we all know she &apos;d rather be with the postman .
am i right ? i &apos;m right , aren &apos;t i ?
aren &apos;t i ?
oh , you &apos;re right .
daddy ! daddy !
sir--you &apos;ve been in a coma , sir .
just relax . just relax .
just relax .
sir .
this is your lucky day .
she &apos;s screaming .
i &apos;m worried someone &apos;s gonna hear her .
i &apos;ll handle it .
are you sure we should keep her ?
she &apos;s perfect .
don &apos;t you agree , mr. conrad ?
what chapter are you on ?
the part where she &apos;s at the coal mines .
say what you will about his writing , maeve ,
it &apos;s fascinating the way he weaves characters into situations , right ?
yeah , i mean , i &apos;m not sure what i think of it .
it &apos;s slightly obtuse .
yeah , he tends to be that way .
i probably should have warned you .
he &apos;s not really anything like sir arthur conan doyle .
still my favorite .
guess what .
what ?
i think the stalker &apos;s gone .
the emails have stopped .
really ? since when ?
two weeks ago .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i wanted to make sure .
what about the phone calls ?
no , i haven &apos;t gotten any .
no more heavy breathing on the machine ,
no more hang @-@ ups .
you know , oftentimes when a stalker &apos;s advances are completely ignored ,
their erotomanic fantasies will be diverted
to a more receptive target .
i went to the store yesterday .
i even sat in the cafe and had coffee without my disguise on .
something deep inside my gut tells me he &apos;s gone .
i think it &apos;s over , spencer .
well , our instincts exist for a reason .
they &apos;re definitely a response to specific ...
i want to meet you .
... environmental stimuli .
did you hear me , spence ?
yeah , i--i-- no , i heard you .
well , what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s time .
let &apos;s get started .
uh ... sorry i &apos;m late , guys . i had an appointment .
yeah . ok .
3 days ago , bruce phillips was found dead
with his blond hair dyed black .
he had been put in a box and left on a busy street .
a custom @-@ made box .
maybe our unsub was a carpenter .
he stuffed him in there practically folding him in half .
he had also been hung and restrained
and that &apos;s where the plot thickens like bad soup .
yesterday , justin marks and connie foster , who were dating ,
they went missing two miles away from the first abduction site .
a couple ? he &apos;s escalating .
yes . this morning justin &apos;s body was found .
he had been hung .
he had been stuffed in a box left in an alley .
officers say his brown hair had been dyed black .
connie &apos;s still missing .
so he probably still has her .
why would he reject justin overnight
but keep the first male victim for two days ?
something about him didn &apos;t work out .
look at his neck .
he was hung multiple times .
the question is , what does he do with connie ?
he could make her watch him abuse the men
or have asphyxiative sex with them .
a brunette male and a woman are crucial to this guys fantasy .
well , he &apos;s kept connie .
maybe she &apos;s the object of his desire .
well , our first order of business is finding her
and then making sure he doesn &apos;t do this again .
wheels up in 30 .
please , please , just tell me where justin is .
please , tell me what you did with him .
please , just tell me that he &apos;s ok , please .
please .
i can &apos;t do that .
just like this ...
there , like that .
there .
there .
say cheese .
cheeeeese ...
william shakespeare once wrote ,
&quot; love looks not with the eyes ,
but with the mind . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s go over victimology .
both male victims had their hair dyed black ,
and the woman is a brunette .
the guys are similar . same ages , same builds .
they were also abducted outside their homes ,
which were all in the same area .
so they were probably being stalked .
was connie with her boyfriend when she was abducted ?
it looks that way .
her purse was found on the ground outside of his house .
so this involves some kind of ruse .
it &apos;s difficult to lure most people
from the security of their own homes .
well , some people let their guard down .
yeah , but stalking victims vary their routes home .
they enter and exit through different doors ,
they wear disguises .
they don &apos;t talk to anyone in their driveway .
they hardly talk to anyone at all .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re terrorized .
ok , so maybe they were followed , reid .
i mean , bottom line is the unsub escalated .
the first male was abducted alone ,
the second was with his girlfriend .
well , what do we know about her ?
connie was in her 30s , baked cakes for a living ,
she never had a run @-@ in with the law .
assuming he kept her , what &apos;s the reason ?
she &apos;s a necessity . somehow she fits into his fantasy .
and so far , that need may be what &apos;s keeping her alive .
so what we know is that we have an unsub
with a fantasy or a deep desire
that requires the man to look a specific way .
since he rejected justin so quickly ,
he &apos;s probably looking for a replacement as we speak .
did you get it ?
yeah , i got everything . nails , wire .
we still need a crank .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
tomorrow will be here before we know it .
yeah , but we can &apos;t just choose anybody .
it has to be the right guy .
someone with black hair ,
same size , and nothing less than perfect .
gin rummy .
help !
help !
please help !
help , please !
oh , my god .
please !
oh , my god .
you &apos;ve gotta help !
please , please , you gotta help .
what happened ?
do you have a phone ?
yes . come in .
this is a pretty open disposal site .
the unsub wasn &apos;t trying to hide his victim .
detective martin , is this how he was found ?
the crime scene &apos;s exactly how we found him .
the coroner &apos;s office was pretty backed up
due to a bus crash ,
so csi just finished working the scene .
look at the box .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s on display .
how considerate .
ok , so this was taken the day he was abducted .
his hair was longer then .
and he painted his nails red .
he didn &apos;t do that to the first guy .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
he &apos;s trying to emasculate them .
it &apos;s all part of the unsub &apos;s fantasy .
please , somebody help me .
what are you doing ?
please ...
please just let me go .
how can i let you go ? we haven &apos;t even started .
what did i do to you ? please ...
please let ...
let me help you .
you know , you really should get some rest .
you have bags under your eyes .
did you kill justin ?
it wasn &apos;t right .
the next one will be better .
do you want me to set up ?
yes . yes , please , set up .
now ...
i have to take your clothes off .
no , please ... no .
no , please , get away from me .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but it &apos;s the only way i can work .
no ... no ...
no !
no !
no !
hotch , our latest abductee
looks just like our last two victims .
his house is in the hunting zone ?
smack in the middle .
roommate came home and saw blood on the window .
wallet and keys are still here , too .
what about hair color ?
naturally black .
he might not be a surrogate .
he might be the actual object of our unsub &apos;s focus .
hotch , you might be right .
you know what , let me call you right back .
i think i got something .
good , thanks .
it &apos;s a little light , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s not blood .
i &apos;ve been getting lame gsws , a few bus crash victims ,
but hanging ? this is fun .
think it was sexual ?
not in the traditional sense .
well , look .
there are numerous ligature marks on the neck ,
indicating he was hung multiple times .
the ones without abrasions
were probably made by something soft , like fabric .
any idea how long it went on for ?
based on the different varying coloration of the bruising ,
i &apos;d say about 12 hours .
this ligature mark with the abrasion is the final one .
there &apos;s an inverted &quot; v &quot; in the back .
he was hung with a leather strap or belt ,
which is what killed him .
oh , we also found ketamine in his system .
well , ketamine acts quickly .
so he must have used a ruse to get close to our victim .
the bones were perfectly disjointed .
could have dislocated from the fall after hanging
or when he shoved him in the box .
well , actually , the bones were dislocated antemortem .
goody . overtime .
can you check to see if the bones were dislocated in the same way ?
yep .
same way .
this guy &apos;s sicker than my last girlfriend .
the question is , why is he doing this ?
medieval torturing techniques have a long , dense history .
skinning someone alive was commonplace .
placing someone &apos;s hand in boiling water
happened almost daily in the church .
please , just tell me what you want .
this is what i want .
focus on the floor .
from the way these joints were disarticulated ,
it appears as though we &apos;re dealing with either drawing and quartering
or the rack .
no !
the rack was the most prevalent way
to disarticulate the human body .
yes ! that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s it !
if our unsub &apos;s using it , he &apos;s beyond maniacal ,
he &apos;s a sadist .
garcia at your service .
can you find anyone in the area
that might sell or rent medieval torture equipment ?
besides a friend of mine in knitting group ?
try s &amp; m suppliers .
we &apos;re looking for a stretching rack .
spanking the keys as we speak .
don &apos;t worry , they like it .
ok , i have cross @-@ checked stretching equipment with s &amp; m equipment
and i found something that stretches something ,
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the something we &apos;re looking for .
maybe he made his own .
that would be pretty elaborate .
i &apos;m gonna keep looking . i &apos;ll get back to you soon .
thanks .
i just went to the latest abductee &apos;s home .
not only did our unsub use fake blood as some kind of ruse ,
but the front porch security cameras were also disconnected
right before the abduction .
so he cased the site .
it &apos;s residential streets , a lot of people coming and going .
that &apos;s high @-@ risk behavior .
maybe the unsub didn &apos;t care .
he needed him and it was worth the risk .
why are they doing this to us ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re ready .
ok . i hope it works this time .
eenie , meanie , miney , mo .
catch a tiger by the toe .
if he hollers , let him go .
eee , meanie ,
miney ...
mo .
no .
i pick ...
y ... o ... u .
the box is wrapped this time .
what is this , a gift ?
his natural hair color is black and still he kills him .
and , look , no neck wounds .
then how did he die ?
maybe he bled out .
or he fell from something .
look at his hands .
he bored holes through the hands that ripped ,
and then he moved them to the wrist .
reid , check the feet .
stigmata ?
hanging and then crucifixion .
so this has to do with religious beliefs .
maybe he &apos;s found a new way to torture them ?
and still he &apos;s keeping connie .
something about her is working .
hotch , look .
these are the exact same jeans that victim number two was wearing .
look at the trim .
bonner brothers . is that a local store ?
about 5 miles .
half thrift store , half yuppie mart .
i &apos;ll have jj and morgan check it out after we give the profile .
due to the sophisticated nature of the crimes ,
we believe that we &apos;re looking for a male unsub who &apos;s at least 30,
who &apos;s torturing his victims .
we think that &apos;s he &apos;s trying to perfect a delusion
at which he &apos;s failed 3 times .
as with most fantasy based crimes ,
the reality never lives up to the perfection of what the unsub envisions .
this fantasy involves the torture and stretching of his victims ,
including men that have had their hair dyed black by the unsub .
before he kills them ,
our unsub fixes their hair and paints their nails .
he &apos;s now escalated to crucifying his latest victim ,
driving holes into his hands and feet .
historically ,
crucifixion is a sentence reserved for serious crimes .
which makes up believe that somewhere in the unsub &apos;s past ,
he feels his victims have wronged him ,
so now he &apos;s performing some sort of inquisition .
this time , you &apos;re going to do it correctly ,
so that he will learn his lesson .
what lesson ?
you know what i &apos;m talking about !
i don &apos;t .
yes , you do !
whether he &apos;s getting his victims to repent
or adhere to certain religious beliefs ,
he is hanging them
as though they were victims of religious tribunals of the 1100s .
but something in his fantasy is not working ,
because he keeps discarding the men .
he kills them and then ritualistically
places them in a box with tissue paper .
which is odd ,
as his initial behavior dehumanizes them .
that means he values those victims more when they &apos;re dead .
so far we believe he has spared the one woman
that he still has in captivity .
she &apos;s either witnessing these horrors
or being forced to participate in them .
crucifixion is sadistic , and watching it
is the ultimate torture .
consequently , we believe
that the killings will continue to escalate
as the unsub strives to achieve his perfection .
thank you .
adam ?
adam ?
they &apos;re ruining it .
they &apos;re ruining it .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i understand .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
what ? what is it ?
you &apos;re ruining it .
instead of taking command like an adult ,
you &apos;re sitting in here crying like a baby !
are you a baby ?
how can you say that ?
do you want him to die again ?
no !
then pull yourself together .
you &apos;re running out of time .
you need to find a father and a son .
i &apos;m ready when you are .
hi . may i help you ?
yeah . we &apos;re looking for these clothes .
we &apos;re out of these .
i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
what &apos;s your name ?
tucker . tucker white .
how may i help you ?
there &apos;s a victim in a case that we &apos;re investigating
who was wearing a shirt and a pair of jeans from here .
you mind if we show you a picture ?
sure . whatever you need .
do you know this man ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
would you happen to have a record of who bought this stuff ?
if he used a credit card , maybe .
but if he used cash , probably not .
but i can look for you .
we &apos;d appreciate that .
right .
this is all very spencer reid .
yeah , it sure is .
well , at least his style is consistent .
yeah , what &apos;s going on with him , anyway ?
oh , i think pretty boy has got a girlfriend .
you do ?
well , why hasn &apos;t he told us ?
i respect his privacy .
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
but i &apos;m not about to play twenty questions
with someone i &apos;m not sleeping with .
what the--
what the hell ?
is this guy serious ?
this is agent jennifer jareau .
i need to put an apb out on a brown chrysler station wagon
driven by a tucker white
going east on dover street .
there you are .
how &apos;s the geographical profiling going ?
and why are you doing it in here ?
it &apos;s going good . i &apos;m just having trouble concentrating out there ,
is all , so i came in here .
so what &apos;s with you today ?
is this about ...
phone booth girl ?
she wants to meet .
wait . you guys have never met ?
aren &apos;t you curious what she looks like ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter what she looks like .
i mean , she &apos;s already the most beautiful girl in the world to me .
it &apos;s just--what if she doesn &apos;t like me ?
why wouldn &apos;t she like you ?
because i &apos;m weird .
i slouch , my hair &apos;s too long ,
my tie &apos;s perpetually crooked .
your hair &apos;s fine .
really ? thanks .
my mom thinks it &apos;s too long .
so does my aunt ethel .
well , you &apos;re not dating them .
i just--i--i just wouldn &apos;t want to ruin something so special
over something so trivial as looks .
i think you &apos;re excited but afraid .
seeing her will only make the relationship better .
trust me .
when does she want to meet ?
right when we get back .
do it .
don &apos;t psych yourself out .
we &apos;ll see .
sir , i have a mom and dad .
they &apos;re looking for me .
hold still , steph .
this is gonna be great .
my name is connie .
what are you doing ?
this is the only way that i can make it stick .
what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s perfect .
i know . i know .
hold still .
almost done .
tucker ?
this is a surprise .
hey , adam .
um ... the fbi came by today .
the fbi ? what for ?
remember those clothes i sold you last month ?
some guy who was wearing them , he ended up dead .
are you serious ?
he was killed , as in murdered , adam .
have you hurt someone ?
no .
no . there must be some misunderstanding .
you bought all 8 sets , adam .
look , ever since your car accident ...
you &apos;ve been acting kind of funny .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
look , why don &apos;t you come in and have some tea .
you need to take the edge off .
i &apos;m serious , adam .
everything is gonna be ok .
promise .
right . i &apos;ll get a warrant over there as soon as possible .
the owner of the vintage shop bolted from the store .
well , i &apos;ve got something strange , too .
the m.e. just called .
not only were there ligature marks on victim 3 &apos;s arms ,
but his jaw was dislocated as well .
his jaw ?
why would you hang someone ,
dislocate their joints and their jaw ,
and then crucify them ?
i can see your wheels turning . don &apos;t hold back .
maybe he &apos;s dislocating their body parts
so he can manipulate them himself .
for what purpose ?
think about it for a second .
if you add the dislocation , the holes in the hands ,
the strange clothing , and the odd makeup ,
i know this sounds crazy , but what if our unsub
is turning his victims into human marionettes ?
the greeks translated &quot; puppets &quot; as &quot; neurospasta , &quot;
which literally means string @-@ pulling .
and throughout time they &apos;ve been used as a method
to tell kings a story
so the subjects didn &apos;t have to speak directly to him .
it was a way to hear the truth .
it seems like this unsub &apos;s doing something similar ,
using his puppets to tell his story .
he can &apos;t be controlling them by hand .
no , he probably built some sort of contraption .
and he &apos;s trying to lift his victims .
that could explain why they discarded the men .
they were too heavy .
what do you see ?
well , i &apos;m checking the licenses of our victims ,
and each one weighed less than the previous one .
you know , if he &apos;s making human marionettes ,
that also explains why he &apos;s stuffing his victims into boxes .
it &apos;s like a sick toy chest .
so he is dehumanizing them ,
but he &apos;s just not killing them .
he &apos;s turning them into his playthings .
a father and son were just abducted from a parking lot at gunpoint .
a witness saw a man force them into a car .
dave , you and blake go check it out .
i &apos;ll have garcia start looking for theater owners
and puppeteers in the area .
ok .
let &apos;s do it again .
should we break their jaws ?
no .
i need to hear them .
please , adam , let us down .
no . you guys have to do it right this time .
you have to save them .
from what ?
from the robber .
i told you .
and ...
again .
ok , there are 5 puppeteers / marionetters in the area .
any of them recently released from prison ?
no . they &apos;re working kids &apos; parties and at hospitals .
what about someone who had a traumatic incident with a brunette girl ?
that &apos;s kind of specific .
hold on , let me patch in morgan and jj .
hey , we &apos;re at the clothing store .
we got the names of 5 people
who left numerous messages for tucker this week .
give them to me .
all right , we got sam holby ,
terrence crammer ,
vincent lang ,
matt parker , and a jill olger .
and no , and i &apos;m cross @-@ checking
those with hotch &apos;s list of puppeteers .
and no .
so i &apos;ve got 8 more names ,
some written on pads in the back ,
others are frequent customers .
penelope , we need you to trace the phone lines here , too ,
see if this guy tucker called the unsub today .
give me your money . give it now .
that &apos;s your cue .
what &apos;s my cue ?
you &apos;re supposed to say ...
&quot; i don &apos;t have any money , &quot;
after he says ,
&quot; give it to me now . &quot;
say it again , mr. conrad .
give me your money . give it now .
i don &apos;t have any money .
you &apos;re lying . i saw you with it .
dad , just give him the money .
i won &apos;t .
mitch , mitch , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re supposed to save my father .
my name is not mitch , and i &apos;m not gonna say these lines .
now ...
if you don &apos;t save him ,
then he is gonna die .
is that what you want ?
people , it &apos;s going to be a full house .
so , push through it .
we just came from the parking lot where the father and son were abducted .
it looks like the unsub might be on the surveillance camera .
witness said there was a blue van .
garcia .
yes , sir .
were there any incidents
involving a father and son in the puppeteers &apos; histories
that you found ?
father and son . ok . no , it &apos;s coming up empty .
what about 20 or 30 years ago ?
well , there was a pretty famous puppeteer in the late fifties
named alex rain .
he died in a robbery .
his son witnessed it .
what was the son &apos;s name ?
adam rain . mom died 10 years ago .
cross @-@ check adam &apos;s name with
the names of the patrons in the clothing store .
oh , i got a big old hit .
ok , mr. rain called tucker , the owner ,
40 times in the last month .
and check this . his father was most well @-@ known
for a pair of puppets named mitch and steph .
the male one had dark black hair , the female was a redhead .
you have an address ?
last known was a building on pine street ,
used to be his father &apos;s theater .
come on , dave .
and guess what he drives .
a blue van . call us back in the car .
two minutes until curtain .
you ready ?
it &apos;s gonna be right this time .
let &apos;s hope so .
break a leg .
ladies and gentlemen ,
truth is what the storyteller brings you .
he holds up a mirror to your soul
and reflects back the truth of what happened ,
or in this case , what should have happened .
and so without further ado ,
the rain theater proudly continues that great tradition
in this very special matinee performance
of &quot; the robbery . &quot;
a family tale
of love ...
and redemption .
somebody ...
help us .
when you pull at the strings of adam the puppeteer ,
he unravels faster than a two @-@ cent romance novel .
he worked at a glue factory most of his adult life .
he was in a car accident that put him in a coma for over a year .
he woke up 3 months ago . straight away , the nurse says
he starts acting really childish , asking for his father ,
who died over 50 years ago .
the head injury must have been the trigger
and he woke up with the delusion that he was a boy again .
like a peter pan syndrome .
and if there was damage to the prefrontal cortex ,
he might lack rational thought and empathy .
so he &apos;s a psychopath who thinks he &apos;s a kid again
and wants to avenge his father &apos;s death .
if the robbery that killed the father happened in the theater ...
he &apos;s reenacting that moment .
give me your money . give it now .
i don &apos;t have any money .
you &apos;re lying . i saw you with it .
dad , just give him the money .
i won &apos;t .
i won &apos;t .
dad , just give him the money .
i won &apos;t .
come on , do something !
do something !
please , mitch , steph !
come on , do something !
do something !
come on , do something .
do something .
adam rain , this is the fbi !
i need to see your hands .
what--what are you doing ?
somebody call security .
you can &apos;t ruin this .
adam , put down the gun .
we &apos;re in the middle of a performance .
this is not a performance .
yes , it is a performance
and this is not how it ends !
we need to get these people to a hospital .
after they save my father
from the robber .
what robber , adam ?
from him !
he did it !
we have to stop him !
mr. rain , it &apos;s only a puppet .
there &apos;s no one there .
when you were young ,
your dad loved you so much ,
he never told you that the puppets weren &apos;t real .
that &apos;s not true .
it is .
and that &apos;s why steph and mitch couldn &apos;t save him that day .
they only moved when he made them .
you &apos;re lying .
adam , don &apos;t do to these people
what the robber did to your father .
you can save them .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
well , i think after this long , hard week we just had ,
we should all head over to rossi &apos;s
and pop open some old , expensive wine .
that &apos;s a plan .
could we maybe play some games , too ?
oh , what kind of games ?
you tell me , sweet cheeks .
hotch , we &apos;re heading to rossi &apos;s . you in ?
uh , jack &apos;s got a sleepover this weekend ,
so i was gonna go to new york and see beth .
hubba hubba .
wait a second . where &apos;s reid ?
he said he had something important to do .
spencer has a girlfriend .
阿瑟 · 柯南 · 道尔
hi .
um , spencer reid for two .
you are the first to arrive .
would you like to be seated ?
yes , i &apos;d like that .
hello .
maeve , it &apos;s me . listen , don &apos;t come to the restaurant .
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m outside .
go home .
spencer , if you don &apos;t want to meet me , you can just say it .
no , that &apos;s not it . look , i think your stalker &apos;s here .
what ?
please just go .
ok .
hey , dick .
good to see you .
