There is a town in Maine...
I'd like a room.
Welcome to storybrooke.
Where every storybook character you've ever known...
Is trapped between two worlds...
An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
And now they don't remember who they are.
Victims of a powerful curse...
Everything you love, everything all of you love,
will be taken from you.
Only one knows the truth,
and only one can break her spell.
It's your destiny.
You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
You enjoy your stay.
Do not despair, my dear. You will attend that ball.
Who are you?
I'm your fairy godmother,
and I'm here to change your life, Cinderella.
But... My stepmother told me that I couldn't go.
She forbade me to leave.
Your stepmother doesn't have this.
This wand has the power to take you to your ball,
to your prince, and to...
What?
What did you do?
Now, now.
I got what I wanted.
There's no need to be frightened.
No need? You just killed my fairy godmother.
She was trying to help me.
Was she?
Do you know what this is?
Pure magic.
Pure evil.
Trust me. I've done you a favor.
All magic comes with a price.
Go on back to your life and thank your lucky stars
you've still got something to go back to.
My life...
It's wretched.
Then change it.
You can't handle this.
Wait. Please wait.
I can handle it.
Please. I will do anything
to get out of here. Anything.
Anything?
Do you know how to use that wand, Mr...
Rumplestiltskin.
And, yes, of course I do.
Then help me.
Well, if I do,
and you can indeed shoulder the, uh...
consequences,
then you'll owe me a favor.
Name it. What do you want?
Something precious.
But I have nothing.
Oh, but you will.
With this wish
will come riches more than you know.
I care nothing for riches. I'll give you anything you want.
Just get me out of here.
Now we're talking.
Well, how does it work?
Fear not.
My needs are small,
and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line.
Do we have a deal?
Yes. Yes. Thank you.
There.
Glass?
Every story needs a memorable detail.
Let's see how they fit, shall we?
Now have a good time, but be sure to watch the clock.
Are you sure we can be out in the open?
Enough sneaking around.
If your mom has a problem with me
walking you to a school bus,
I am more than happy to have that chat.
You're brave.
You'll need that for Operation Cobra.
Speaking of, do you think we need code names?
Isn't "Cobra" our code name?
That's the mission. I mean us.
I need something to call you.
Well, you can just call me "Emma" for now.
Okay, well, then I'll see you later, Emma.
What's with the siren?
It's so hard to get your attention.
All right, well, you got it. Are you arresting me again?
I'm thanking you...
For your help finding that coma patient.
We all owe you a debt of gratitude.
Well, what do I get--
a commendation? Key to the city?
How about a job? I could use a deputy.
Thank you, but I have a job.
As a bail bonds person,
there's not much of that going on here.
I don't see a lot of sheriffing going on around here, either.
Well, here's your chance to see it up close.
There's dental.
Why don't you think about it and stay a while?
Thank you.
How was your walk with Henry?
That's right. I know everything...
But relax. I don't mind.
You don't?
No,
because you no longer worry me, Ms. Swan.
You see, I did a little digging into who you are,
and what I found out was quite soothing.
It all comes down to the number seven.
Seven?
It's the number of addresses you've had in the last decade.
Your longest stint anywhere was two years.
Really, what did you enjoy
so much about Tallahassee?
If you were wonding, I did find a place here in town.
I know, with Ms. Blanchard.
How long is your lease?
Oh, wait. You don't have one.
You see my point?
In order for something to grow, Ms. Swan, it needs roots,
and you don't have any.
People don't change.
They only fool themselve into believing they can.
You don't know me.
No, I think I do.
All I ask is,
as you carry on your transient life,
you think of Henry and what's best for him,
perhaps consider a clean break,
it's gonna happen anyway.
Enjoy your cocoa.
Ohh. Really?
Do you have a laundry I can use?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
You okay?
The sheets, they're...uh...they're pink.
You tried bleach?
Last night I felt contractions,
the doctor said that the baby can come any day now.
So... that's great.
It's just that, um,
when the--when the baby comes...
No one thinks that I can do this.
No one thinks I can do anything.
Maybe they're right.
Screw them.
What?
Screw them. How old are you?
19.
I was 18.
When you-- when you had a kid?
Yeah. I know what it's like.
Everyone loves to tell you
what you can and can't do,
especially with a kid, but ultimately,
whatever you're considering doing... or giving up...
The choice is yours.
It's not exactly what you might think it is.
It never is.
People are gonna tell you who you are your whole life.
You just gotta punch back and say,
"No, this is who I am."
You want people to look at you differently? Make them.
You want to change things,
you're gonna have to go out there and change them yourself,
because there are no fairy godmothers in this world.
Ashley.
What are you doing?
Changing my life.
I know you think otherwise,
but I don't enjoy these Saturday city council meetings.
Sometimes they're just unavoidable.
Now... you know the rules?
Yes on homework, no on tv, and stay inside.
Good boy.
Under no circumstance do you leave this house.
You mean don't see my mom.
She's not your mother.
She's just a woman passing through.
Now do as I say, or there will be consequences.
I'll be back at 5:00 sharp.
I'm so glad my stuff is here.
Oh, thanks.
So that's all your stuff?
What do you mean?
Is the rest in storage?
No, this is all of it.
I'm... not sentimental.
Well, it must make things easier when you have to move.
Ms. Blanchard, is Ms. Swan here?
Hi. My name is Mr. Gold.
We met briefly on your arrival.
I remember.
Good. I have a proposition for you, Ms. Swan.
I, uh, I need your help. I'm looking for someone.
Really? Um...
You know what? I'm gonna go jump i-in the bath.
I have a photo.
Her name is, uh, Ashley Boyd,
and she's taken something quite valuable of mine.
So why don't you just call the police?
Because, uh...
She's a confused young woman.
She's pregnant, alone, and scared.
I don't want to ruin this young girl's life,
but I just want my property returned.
And what is it?
Well, one of the advantages of you not being the police
is discretion.
Let's just say it's a precious object and leave it at that.
When did you see her last?
Last night. That's-- that's how I got this.
It's so unlike her.
She was quite wound up,
rambling on and on about changing her life.
I have no idea what got into her.
Ms. Swan, please just help me find her.
My only other choice is the police,
and I don't think anyone wants to see
that baby born in jail, now do they?
No, of course not.
So you'll help me then?
I will help her.
Grand.
Hey, Emma, I was thinking we--
Hey, Henry. How are you?
Okay.
Good.
Give my regards to your mother,
and, um, good luck, Ms. Swan.
Do you know who that is?
Yeah, of course I do.
Who? 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out.
Oh, I meant in reality.
Is that... all you brought?
Henry, what are you doing here?
My mom's gone till 5:00. I thought we could hang out.
Aw, kid, I wish I could, but there's something I gotta do.
Please let me help.
No, no. It could be dangerous.
The pregnant maid is dangerous?
She assaulted Mr. Gold.
Cool.
This isn't a game. She's desperate.
How do you know?
Because I know.
Well, then let's find her.
Oh, no, no, no. There is no "Let's."
You cannot come with me.
Then I'll look for her myself.
Then I'll find you, and I'll bring you back.
Then you wouldn't be helping the maid.
I am just trying to be responsible here.
And I'm just trying to spend time with you.
Oh, that is really not fair.
So the maid-- what's her story?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Every year when I was growing up,
I used to watch these fireworks from afar.
And I knew what they meant.
Something special was happening at the palace...
Now they're for me,
for our wedding.
I'm so happy you could come.
Son.
Thank you, Father.
My dear Ella,
we are thrilled to have you join our family,
and I hope our family will soon be growing.
My darling.
Congratulations, Ella. You two are gonna be very happy.
Why, thank you, James.
Ella, dear.
Oh! Sorry.
This is truly a night for celebration.
Do you realize what an inspiration you are to everyone?
All I did was get married.
All you did was show that anyone can change her life.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you, too.
You. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to make sure you were happy
with your end of the bargain--
You know,
true love, riches, happy endings.
Did you get everything you desired?
Yes. Yes, I did. Now what do you want?
What's your price? My jewels? The ring?
No, no, dear. Keep your baubles.
What I want is something you don't yet possess,
but something I know is... coming...
Your firstborn.
What are you doing?
I thought you were hunting.
I was, but the weather wasn't agreeing,
so we came back early.
Are we going somewhere?
You're going somewhere.
Something's happened.
What?
I'm pregnant.
Ella, that's wonderful.
Why are you upset? This is what we wanted.
There's something else.
When we met that night at the ball...
It wasn't my fairy godmother who sent me.
It was rumplestiltskin.
I made a deal with him for this life.
I was stupid.
I didn't understand the price of magic,
so I promised him something.
What did you promise him?
He tricked me.
I thought that he'd want our gold or jewels.
What was it?
Our baby?
I'm so sorry,
and now I'm gonna lose it all--
My life and... you.
No.
I don't care what that imp said.
Magic may have brought us together,
but it didn't create this love.
But I made a deal.
I can't break that. He's too powerful.
Then the answer is simple.
We make another deal.
So this boyfriend of hers--
You don't think he was involved in her disappearance?
Uh, that would mean he was involved with her at all,
which he isn't.
He left her in the lurch right after they found out
they were expecting.
Hasn't spoken to her since. Like I said, he's a--
Hey, hey, hey! Billy, be careful.
You almost shattered my wolf thing, Billy.
It's good luck.
I'm sorry, Ruby, but, look, it's fine.
Um, Ruby, what about her family?
Oh, um, she's got a stepmom and two stepsisters
that she doesn't talk to.
Wait. A stepmom, stepsisters, and she's a maid?
Henry, not now.
Look, I don't know what you've heard, but it's wrong.
Everyone thinks she's not ready to have this kid,
but she's trying-- taking night classes,
trying to better herself,
trying to get her life together.
Can you understand that?
I think so.
Then maybe you should just stay out of it.
She's been through enough already.
I've been through it, too, Ruby, and I can help her.
Then try her ex.
Where can I find him?
He lives with his dad.
Can I help you?
Sean Herman?
Yeah. Who are you?
I'm Emma Swan. I'm...
I'm looking for Ashley Boyd.
She's in trouble.
I just thought maybe she came to see you.
My son doesn't have anything to do with that girl anymore,
so whatever trouble she's in, I am sorry for,
but there's nothing we can do to help you.
You're the reason he broke up with her.
Absolutely. I'm not gonna let my son
throw away his entire life over a mistake.
So you just told him to leave her?
Well, what are they going to do, raise the child
in the backseat of a car?
Some people only have the backseat of a car.
Well, they're to be pitied.
I'm not letting that happen to my son.
Dad, maybe we should help her look.
It's a waste, Sean.
Sean, if you want to come, come.
Stop letting other people make decisions for you.
If Ashley runs away with this baby,
she's gonna be in some serious trouble.
She's running away with the baby?
Yes.
Sean, inside.
Now.
Look, believe me...
If I knew where she was, I would tell you.
I went to a lot of trouble to get her that deal.
Deal? What are you talking about?
You don't know? Ashley agreed to give up the child,
and she's being paid very well to do so.
She sold the baby?
Oh, you make it sound so crass.
I found someone who's going to find that child
a good and proper home.
And who are you to judge
whether Ashley is capable of providing that?
Look at her. She's a teenager,
and she's never shown any evidence of being responsible.
How could she possibly know how to be a mother?
Maybe she's changing her life.
Everybody says that. Now, look, I found someone
who's going to pay Ashley extremely well,
someone who's going to see to it that everybody's happy.
Mr. Gold.
Well, isn't that why you were hired,
to bring him the baby?
You can't make her double-cross Gold.
No one's ever broken a deal with him.
Happy to be the first.
If Ashley wants to have this baby, she should have it.
Anyone who wants to be a mother should damn well
be allowed to be one.
Why didn't you tell me she sold the baby?
Because I didn't think it was important.
Really, considering that's why she's running away?
Look, Ashley's my friend.
I don't like the idea of people judging her.
Ruby, where's your car?
You didn't send me to Sean to find her.
You sent me there to give her a head start.
Look, I'm only trying to help her.
Yeah, so am I.
Ashley's in more trouble than you know, Ruby.
Where is she? Don't make her deal with Gold without me.
I can't talk in front of him. He's the mayor's kid.
Hey, I'm on your side.
Henry... I need to find this woman,
and in order to do that, I need you to go home, okay?
So please listen to me, seriously.
She's not gonna tell me anything if you're around.
Okay.
Thank you.
She left town. Said she was gonna try Boston.
Thought she could disappear there.
How long ago did she leave?
About a half an hour.
What'd she tell you?
Henry, what the hell?
I am going to Boston. You can't come with me.
You can't go to Boston.
She can't leave.
Bad things happen to anyone that does.
I don't have time to argue with you over the curse.
I've got to get you home.
We have to stop her before she gets hurt.
We're wasting time.
If you drop me off, you'll never catch up to her.
Henry...
Then Mr. Gold will call the police,
and he'll have her sent to jail.
Buckle up.
Ashley, what did you get yourself into?
Why are we down here?
We need a place to keep him.
Rumplestiltskin is the most dangerous man
in all the realms.
He needs his own special prison,
so we converted the mines to hold him.
But how will we get him here?
He's eluded all forever.
His strength is also his weakness--his deals.
He can't resist making them, and we already know
who he wants to deal with next--you.
We've sent word with one of Snow's bluebirds.
He's accepted a meeting with you.
You're going to tell him that doc heard something
with his stethoscope-- two heartbeats.
You're going to tell him it's twins.
And if he wants both, which he will,
you propose a new deal.
Grumpy.
A quill? I-I don't understand.
The blue fairy casts a spell on it.
Whoever signs with this will be frozen,
their magic made impotent.
All you must do is to get him to sign the contract.
Ella, this man is a scourge.
You are doing the entire land a service.
Should we even use magic?
Isn't that what's causing these problems to begin with?
What if this magic also has a price?
Then I will pay it.
I will do whatever is needed
to save you and our child.
Let's go.
I hope you like it.
A lot of dwarf blood went into it.
You sure this will work?
Once he's in there, he'll never get out.
You'll be safe.
We can do this, Ella.
Okay.
Let's get him.
I told you.
It's her car.
Ashley?
My baby.
It's coming.
Is the baby really coming?
Oh, yeah. Don't worry. The hospital isn't that far.
No. No, no, no. Take me to boston.
I can't go back there. Oh, no.
We don't have four hours. Trust me. I know.
No, I can't go back there. Please.
He's gonna take my baby.
I won't let that happen.
But do you know what you're asking for if you keep this child?
Are you really ready?
Yeah.
Are you sure? Because I wasn't.
You weren't?
Nope. If you want to give this kid its best chance,
it's gonna be with someone who's ready.
So know what that means.
Your whole life is gonna change, and once you decide
that it's yours, this running away can't happen.
You have to grow up, and you can't ever leave.
Understand?
Yes.
I want my baby.
Well, well, well.
You're starting to show.
A little bird told me you wanted to speak.
Yes.
I'd like to alter the bargain.
That's not what I do.
But I think you'll want to.
I'm having twins.
Is that so?
Let's have a look.
And you would, what, give up both?
Why is that? I wonder.
My husband--he's...
He's having a hard time. Our kingdom is poor.
We're losing money. Our crops are dying.
We can't support ourselves or our people.
And you would trade your other child for...
Comfort?
I can always have more children,
but I can't make crops grow where the soil is dead.
In exchange for our other child,
you will see to it that our land is once again fertile.
I think it's more than fair.
Yes!
Yes, yes.
It is, if what you're saying is true.
It is, and all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.
What a lovely quill!
Wherever did you get it?
It's from our castle.
You know, the only way to stop me is through magic.
I'm not trying to stop you.
Of course you're not, because as we all know,
all magic comes with a price,
and if you were to use it to, say...imprison me,
then your debt to me would only grow,
and we wouldn't want that now, would we?
Just sign the contract, please.
Are you sure you're happy with this new arrangement?
Then so it shall be.
Thomas!
No one breaks deals with me, deary.
No one.
No matter where you are, no matter what land you find yourself in...
I assure you, I will have your baby.
You know, Emma, you're different.
What's that?
You're the only one who can do it.
Break the curse?
Yes, I know. You keep telling me that.
No. Leave.
You're the only one who can leave Storybrooke.
You left and came and found me in Boston.
But I came back. I'm 10.
I had no choice, but if anyone else tried to go,
bad things would happen.
Anyone except... me?
You're the savior. You can do whatever you want.
You can go.
Ms. Swan, the baby is a healthy 6-pound girl,
and the mother is doing fine.
What lovely news. Excellent work, Ms. Swan.
Thank you for bringing me my merchandise.
Did we really win?
Yes. I told you we would.
I was so afraid.
I was so afraid that we'd fail, that...
I'd have to go back to that life, that...
That terrible life. I was...
I was afraid that I would lose you
and that nothing would have changed.
As long as I'm alive, you will never go back to that life.
Now... How is our little Alexandra?
Alexandra?
Did I not mention that I picked out a name?
A name? That's more like a prison sentence.
Well, I like it.
Men. You really know nothing of ch--
Ella, what is it?
Oh, it's--it's the baby.
Something's wrong.
No, no. It can't be. It's too soon.
It must be the stress, the excitement.
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Sit. Sit.
I'll go get you water.
Okay.
Thomas, it's okay!
It's passed.
Thomas?
Thomas?
Thomas?!
What did you do?
Ella, what's wrong?
Your highness, what happened?
What did you do to my Thomas?
I haven't done anything.
In case you haven't noticed, I've been otherwise engaged.
Something's happened to him. You know! Tell me!
I have no idea, deary,
but I did warn you.
All magic comes at a price.
It looks like someone has just paid.
Don't listen to him. We'll find Thomas.
No, you won't.
Until that debt is paid, until that baby is mine,
you're never gonna see him again,
in this world or the next, Cinderella.
I will have that baby!
Well, well.
Must be my lucky day.
Care for a cup, Ms. Swan?
A baby? That's your merchandise?
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, because at the time, you didn't need to know.
Really? Or you thought I wouldn't take the job?
On the contrary,
I thought it would be more effective if you found out yourself.
After seeing Ashley's hard life,
I thought it would make sense... to you.
I mean, if anyone could understand the reasons
behind giving up a baby, I assumed it would be you.
You're not getting that kid.
Actually, we have an agreement,
and my agreements are always honored.
If not, I'm going to have to involve the police,
and that baby is going to end up in the system,
and that would be a pity.
You didn't enjoy your time in the system, did you, Emma?
That's not gonna happen.
I like your confidence.
Charming, but all I have to do is press charges.
She did, after all, break into my shop.
Let me guess. To steal a contract.
Who knows what she was after?
You know, no jury in the world will put a woman in jail
whose only reason for breaking and entering was to keep her child.
I'm willing to roll the dice that contract doesn't stand up.
Are you?
Not to mention what might come out about you in the process.
Somehow I suspect there is more to you than a simple pawnbroker.
You really want to start that fight?
I like you, Ms. Swan. You're not afraid of me,
and that's either cocky or presumptuous.
Either way, I'd rather have you on my side.
So she can keep the baby?
Not just yet.
There's still the matter of my agreement with Ms. Boyd.
Tear it up.
That's not what I do.
You see, contracts, deals--
Well, they're the very foundation of all civilized existence,
so I put it to you now.
If you want Ashley to have that baby,
are you willing to make a deal with me?
What do you want?
Oh, I don't know just yet.
You'll owe me a favor.
Deal.
What's her name?
Alexandra.
That's pretty.
Thank you for getting me here.
Mr. Gold was outside.
I took care of it. She's yours.
She is?
But what did you do?
Made a deal with him.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kid, it's almost 5:00.
We gotta get you home.
I have to go.
Henry's expecting me home at 5:00...
But I'll see you again...
At the next council meeting.
Oh, and don't forget,
you left your socks under the bed.
"Pumpkin." My code name.
I was thinking, in honor of Cinderella--
Pumpkin.
You got a better one in mind?
Yep.
Well?
I'm not sure you're ready yet.
Henry!
About what you said at the hospital
about me being able to leave...
Yeah?
See you tomorrow.
Henry?
Henry?
What did I tell you?
Do not...
leave your shoes lying around on the stairs.
Someone could get hurt.
Is that her?
Sean.
I am so sorry. I never should have left you.
You're back?
Yeah, I'm back.
Here. I got her a present.
I don't know if they're gonna fit.
They're perfect.
Hello?
Graham, it's Emma.
I was thinking...
Maybe some roots wouldn't be so bad.
That deputy job still open?
Absolutely.
Then I'm in.
Regina gonna be okay with this?
I don't care. It's my department.
I'll see you Monday morning.
