第二十二集
no !
i will find you !
i wonder if you &apos;ll be quite so incorruptible
after your precious snow is gone .
i do hope you like apples .
it &apos;s poison . you may not believe in the curse ,
but i believe in you .
henry ?
i will find you , snow .
i will always find you .
it &apos;ll be hard to do that without your head .
get up . the queen is looking forward to your execution .
get up ! on your feet .
shoot him .
who the hell are you ?
a friend .
i don &apos;t know you .
but i know snow white .
is she okay ?
the queen was traveling to meet her .
her fate is in a precarious place .
we must hurry . follow me . i can get you out .
i &apos;ll try and stall the queen .
the rest is up to you .
your weapon and some provisions .
good luck .
you &apos;re not coming with me ?
i cannot .
i gave up my heart so that the queen would spare snow &apos;s .
don &apos;t let my sacrifice be in vain . find her .
henry , can you hear me ?
come on , henry .
wake up , please . come on , henry .
come on . you can do it .
ma &apos;am , let me take you to--
no ! i am not going anywhere !
there &apos;s no pupil response .
what happened ? did he fall , hit his head ?
he ate this . i think it &apos;s poisoned .
his airway &apos;s clear .
did he vomit ? any convulsion or disorientation ?
he took a bite of this , and then he just collapsed ,
so run the test for arsenic or bleach or drano
or whatever could &apos;ve done this to him !
the boy is showing no symptoms that would suggest neurotoxins ,
so whatever &apos;s going on , this is not the culprit !
well , what else could it be ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to find out .
he &apos;s gonna be okay , though , right ?
right now we just need to stabilize him ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s slipping away .
is there anything else that you can remember ,
any little detail ?
i already told you everything . do something !
look , i understand you &apos;re frustrated , ms. swan .
i do , but i need something to treat ,
and right now there is no explanation .
it &apos;s like ...
like magic .
every story in this book actually happened .
good @-@ bye , emma .
you should know more than anyone ,
because you &apos;re in this book .
find us .
where &apos;s my son ?
you did this .
no .
you did this !
what the hell are you doing ? !
stop this ! my son--
is sick because of you !
that apple turnover you gave me--he ate it !
what ?
it was meant for you !
it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ? !
all of it .
yes .
i was leaving town .
why couldn &apos;t you just leave things alone ?
because as long as you &apos;re alive , henry will never be mine !
he &apos;ll never be anyone &apos;s unless you fix this .
you wake him up !
i can &apos;t !
don &apos;t you have magic ?
that was the last of it .
it was supposed to put you to sleep !
what &apos;s it gonna do to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
magic here is unpredictable .
so ...
so he could ...
yes .
so what do we do ?
we need help .
there &apos;s one other person in this town who knows about this ...
knows about magic .
mr. gold .
actually , he goes by &quot; rumplestiltskin . &quot;
where is he ?
the prisoner !
escaped .
a palace full of guards ,
and you let him escape ?
i did my best .
you failed , and do you know what happens
to people who fail me , huntsman ?
i &apos;ll find him . you needn &apos;t worry .
leave him to me .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
he &apos;s mine .
lost , are we ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just here to help .
well , no need . i &apos;ll be fine .
no , i don &apos;t think so . this is the infinite forest .
there &apos;s no way out .
well , except ... my way .
i want nothing from you .
not even this ?
my mother &apos;s ring . it was just ...
how did you get it ? !
the same way i get everything i want--
magic , the same magic that allows me to do ...
this .
this ring is now enchanted .
the closer you get to snow white ,
the brighter it will glow .
interested ?
give it to me .
ah ! it &apos;s not something for nothing , dearie .
time to make a deal .
no ! no more deals !
over here .
persistent .
had enough ?
never .
looking for this ?
so brave .
so gallant .
so pointless .
bravery won &apos;t get you out of this forest , dearie .
magic will . trust me .
this is a deal you want to make ,
because we both want the same thing .
what &apos;s that ?
why , you and your true love to be together , of course .
david .
i was wrong ...
about you , about me , about ...
everything .
i didn &apos;t believe in you ,
and i wish i had a good reason why ...
but it &apos;s like i keep making these wrong decisions ,
and i don &apos;t understand why they keep happening .
you know , ever since i woke up from that coma ,
my life hasn &apos;t made a lick of sense ,
except for you ,
and what i &apos;m feeling ...
it &apos;s love , mary margaret .
david , why are you here ?
because kathryn put a down payment on an apartment in boston .
she &apos;s not gonna use it , but i am .
unless you give me a reason to stay .
david .
i can &apos;t .
behold .
the most powerful magic of all ...
true love .
ah ! careful .
this is all i have left of it .
what do you know of true love ?
well , not so much as you , perhaps ,
but not so little as you might think .
you ? you loved someone ?
it was a brief flicker of light amidst an ocean of darkness .
what happened ?
she died .
that &apos;s the thing about true love , dearie .
it can slip through your fingers .
it &apos;s the most powerful magic in the world ,
the only magic powerful enough to break any curse .
it must be protected at all costs .
i don &apos;t understand .
what exactly is it you want me to do ?
i want you to help me protect it
by putting it in a safe place for me .
and where is that ?
inside the belly of a beast , of course .
why hide it ?
let &apos;s just say , i &apos;m saving it for a rainy day .
do my eyes deceive me ,
or is that the look of a believer ?
we need your help .
indeed you do .
it seems quite the tragic ailment has befallen our young friend .
i told you , magic comes with a price .
henry shouldn &apos;t have to pay it .
no , you should , but alas , we are where we are .
can you help us ?
of course .
true love , ms. swan--
the only magic powerful enough to transcend realms
and break any curse .
luckily for you , i happen to have bottled some .
you did ?
oh , yes .
from strands of your parents &apos; hair ,
i made the most powerful potion in all the realm ,
so powerful that when i created the dark curse ,
i placed a single drop on the parchment ,
just a little safety valve .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m the savior .
that &apos;s why i can break the curse .
now you &apos;re getting it .
i don &apos;t care about breaking the curse .
all i care about is saving henry .
which is why it &apos;s your lucky day .
i didn &apos;t use all the potion .
i saved some for a rainy day .
well , it &apos;s storming like a bitch . where is it ?
where it is isn &apos;t the problem .
getting it is what should worry you .
enough riddles . what do we do ?
you do nothing . it has to be ms. swan .
he &apos;s my son . it should be me .
all due respect ,
but it &apos;s her son , and it has to be her .
she &apos;s the product of the magic .
she must be the one to find it .
i can do it .
don &apos;t trust him .
what choice do we have ?
that &apos;s right , dearie . what choice do you have ?
where is this magic ?
tell me , your majesty ,
is our friend still in the basement ?
oh , you twisted little imp .
you hid it with her ?
oh , no , not with her .
in her .
i knew you couldn &apos;t resist bringing her over .
who is &quot; her &quot; ?
someone you should be prepared for .
where you &apos;re going , you &apos;re going to need this .
what is that ?
your father &apos;s sword .
henry ...
you were right about the curse .
i should have believed you .
i &apos;m sorry .
for when you wake up .
say what you gotta say . you got ten minutes .
you know where to meet ?
yeah . don &apos;t be late .
i &apos;m sorry .
pity , isn &apos;t it ?
there &apos;s nothing harder
than not knowing whether you &apos;ll ever see your child again .
jefferson , now is not a good time .
for you .
well , for me , it &apos;s the perfect time .
i &apos;m here to collect .
where-- where is she--my daughter ?
emma was supposed to eat that apple ,
and she didn &apos;t . as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
that makes our deal null and void .
i did what you asked ,
and you &apos;re gonna screw me over again ?
look at it however you want , jefferson .
the fact is , i &apos;m done with you .
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m not done with you .
what are you going to do ?
kill me ?
i know you want to , but i also know you can &apos;t .
do you ?
yes .
you don &apos;t have it in you .
now if you excuse me ...
i have to save my son .
august ?
please open up .
i know you &apos;re in there . open the door .
i can &apos;t .
no .
what &apos;s happening to you ?
you can see it now .
you believe .
yeah . i do , but ...
h @-@ how do i stop this ?
break the curse .
i &apos;ll try . i promise , but i gotta save henry first ,
and i need your help .
no , you don &apos;t .
yeah , i do . this is all too much .
i @-@ i just ...
talked to the evil queen and rumplestiltskin
about a quest to find magic .
i can &apos;t do it , august .
i can &apos;t . no normal person can .
luckily for us ,
you &apos;re not normal .
you can save henry .
you can save all of ...
august ?
what is this place ?
would you like a tour , or shall we just get to it ?
lead the way .
get in .
after you .
it &apos;s a 2 @-@ man job . the elevator &apos;s hand @-@ operated .
i have to stay up here and lower you down .
and i am just supposed to trust you ?
i don &apos;t think you have much choice in the matter , ms. swan .
this battle i &apos;m supposed to fight--
who is it ? what is down there ?
an old friend .
then why don &apos;t you go talk to them ?
because her punishment here was different than everyone else &apos;s .
i trapped her ...
in a different form .
she doesn &apos;t wanna hear from me .
you have to trust me on that .
okay . i will go down there .
but let &apos;s be clear about something ...
&quot; your majesty . &quot;
the only reason you &apos;re not dead
is because i need your help to save henry .
if he dies ...
so do you .
well , then let &apos;s get on with it .
now this is what you &apos;re going to have to do .
where is it ?
where is the beast that reigns over this castle ?
that would be me .
but &quot; beast &quot; is so harsh .
i prefer &quot; maleficent . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna need a smaller egg .
such a shame . so handsome .
show yourself , witch .
come on !
what the hell with this .
&quot; and , yes , she was beyond hope ,
beyond saving .
this was her end .
when prince charming saw his beloved snow white
in her glass coffin ,
he knew all that was left was to say good @-@ bye .
he had to give her one last kiss ,
and when he did ,
true love proved more powerful than any curse .
a pulse of pure love shuddered out and engulfed the land ,
waking up snow white and bringing light to the darkness . &quot;
henry ...
when i gave you this book , it was because i knew ...
i know life doesn &apos;t always have a happy end .
but i thought ...
what is it ?
dr. whale ? !
dr. whale , what is that ? !
what--what-- what &apos;s wrong ?
nurse , get her out of here now !
what is it , please ?
what is it ?
his heart rate &apos;s falling .

there &apos;s a sick boy . he took a bad turn .
how tragic . is there any hope for a ...
recovery ?
doubtful .
come with me .
who are you ?
why are you doing this ?
my name is jefferson ,
and i need your help to do something that i can &apos;t .
there &apos;s a man . his name is mr. gold .

all you have to do is tell him where you &apos;ve been
and that regina locked you up .
wait a minute . what ?
it &apos;s very important .
mr. gold &apos;s gonna protect you ,
but you have to tell him regina locked you up .
he &apos;s gonna know what to do .

impressive , dearie .
very impressive , indeed .
come warm yourself .
i have done what you &apos;ve asked .

of course . you &apos;re in a bit of a rush .
how rude of me .
with this ...
prince charming ...
you will find her .
thank you .
something &apos;s missing .
now you &apos;re ready for your big moment .
why do you want us together ?
what do you get out of it ?
i &apos;m a fan of true love , dearie ,
and , more importantly , what it creates .
really ?
you &apos;re too late .
no . no !
at least let me say good @-@ bye .
you found me .
did you ever doubt i would ?
how did you do it ?
with this .
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s ring . it ...
led me back to you .
and now ...
i never want it off your finger .
will you marry me ?
what do you think ?
what is it ?
there &apos;s the little matter of your father and my stepmother .
ah . that .
i &apos;m open to suggestions .
here &apos;s one .

like we shall do everything--
together .
regina ! what the hell was that ? !
regina !
ms. swan ?

mr. gold . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve come to check on you .
i &apos;m glad i did . regina abandoned you
and sabotaged the elevator .
what ? i &apos;m coming up .
no . there &apos;s-- there &apos;s no time for this .
you can &apos;t possibly scale the wall and carry that .
yeah ? well , i can try .
no , you can &apos;t . just toss it up .
your boy &apos;s gonna be fine .
i promise .
we &apos;re running out of time . toss it up .

mr. gold ?
gold !
regina .
uhh ! he tricked you !
how could you give him that ?
where is he ?

gold .
he manipulated all of this .
come on . he can &apos;t be that far .
it &apos;s the hospital .
we did everything we could .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re too late .
um , excuse me ? are you mr. gold ?
yes , i am , but i &apos;m afraid the shop &apos;s closed--
i was , uh , i was told to--to find you
and tell you that
regina locked me up .
does--does that mean anything to you ?
you &apos;re real .
you &apos;re alive .
she did this to you ?
i was told you &apos;d protect me .
oh , yes .
yes , i &apos;ll protect you .
um , i &apos;m sorry . do--do i know you ?
no .
but you will .
no .
no .
i love you , henry .
i love you , too .
you saved me .
you did it .
henry ...
what &apos;s going on ?
no .
the curse .
i think you broke it .
that was true love &apos;s kiss .
no . no .
if i were you , your majesty ,
i &apos;d find a place to hide .
henry ...
no matter what you think ,
no matter what anyone tells you ,
i do love you .
snow !
charming .
you found me .
did you ever doubt i would ?
wait .
no , no , we &apos;re very close .
rumplestiltskin , wait .

i @-@ i love you .
yes .
yes .
and i love you , too .
but , hey ...
there &apos;ll be time for that .
there &apos;ll be time for everything .
but first ...
there &apos;s something i must do .
what is this ?
this is a very special place , belle .
the waters that run below
are said to have the power to return that which one has lost .
henry , what &apos;s going on here ?
if the curse is broken , why didn &apos;t they go back ?
i ... i don &apos;t know .
are you okay ?
what is that ?
something bad .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re in a land without magic power ,
and i &apos;m bringing it .
magic ... is coming .
why ?
why ?
because magic ...
is power .
