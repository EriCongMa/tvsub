hello !
hello ? !
is somebody there ?
who is that ?
what are you doing ?
run !
run !
go !
it &apos;s done . i @-@ i &apos;ve already canceled the deal .
but you loved that condo .
yeah , but i can &apos;t risk my new neighbors getting hurt
if this whack job decides
he wants to burn down my place again .
okay , so you &apos;re just going to stay at frankie &apos;s indefinitely ?
okay . what if you can have an entire townhouse to yourself ,
no neighbors ?
well , then i would be rich .
and i wouldn &apos;t be a detective .
my friend rick sullivan --
he &apos;s a medieval @-@ studies professor at bcu --
yawn .
he &apos;s leaving on sabbatical ,
and he offered to let you sublet his home while he is away .
and it &apos;s a block from me .
that means it &apos;s a block away from ma , too .
wha -- okay , did you tell him that my apartment burned down ?
i did , and it turns out that the townhouse is owned by bcu ,
so it &apos;s insured , and he &apos;s willing to take the risk .
hey , ma .
i wasn &apos;t snooping , i swear .
i don &apos;t believe it for one second .
she was totally snooping . why ? what ?
no , no , i needed to go into vince &apos;s desk
to get the inventory from last month .
and , um ...
i found ... this .
no .
did you open it ?
of course not .
liar !
maybe .
okay , let &apos;s see .
vince is gonna propose to kiki !
the sergeant has excellent taste .
no !
it &apos;s bad luck .
what bad lu-- i &apos;ve never heard of that before .
yeah , i &apos;m not aware of that superstition , either .
yeah , it &apos;s bad luck . you have to let your mother try it on first .
sneaky , ma .
i like that .
rizzoli .
isles .
give it to me .
okay , here .
try it on . here .
okay , it &apos;s tight .
yeah , maybe it really is bad luck .
that is exactly how superstitions get started .
okay , yeah , i &apos;m on my way .
think kiki will say yes ?
i hope so .
i mean , she and korsak seem to make an excellent match .
yeah .
you don &apos;t think so ?
no , i @-@ i think they &apos;re great together .
he seems very happy .
i actually heard him giggle yesterday .
you &apos;re worried if he gets married , things will change .
things will change .
he &apos;ll be married , and he &apos;ll be happy ,
and then he &apos;ll leave the force .
you don &apos;t know that .
watch .
at least you have me .
yeah , but you don &apos;t carry a gun .
no , but i am fantastic with a scalpel .
very true .
just ...
i can &apos;t imagine doing this without him , you know ?
he &apos;s always been there for me .
don &apos;t say anything about the ring , okay ?
just let him bring it up in his own time .
play it cool .
right .
cool .
hello , maura .
i don &apos;t know anything .
about ... the case .
i don &apos;t know anything about the case .
what can you tell me ?
i --
victim is female , late 20s , no i.d.
building is abandoned .
homeless people sometimes camp out here .
one of them found her hidden back here .
looks like the body has been moved .
somebody could have been tied up here .
gag or blindfold , maybe .
maura , do you see any abrasions on the wrists ?
no . no , i , uh ...
don &apos;t see any rope burns or abrasions on the skin .
maura , we can have kent here in 15 minutes .
you don &apos;t have to be here .
i &apos;m fine .
if somebody was tied up ,
it &apos;s unlikely that it was our victim .
well , maybe she was the abductor and not the abductee .
based on decomposition and the bloating of the intestines ,
i &apos;d estimate the time of death to be at least five days ago .
so sometime over the weekend .
i see at least two stab wounds
and what appear to be several defensive injuries .
we &apos;ll look under the fingernails for dna .
work boot ?
man &apos;s size 11 .
so what happened ? guy with size 11 boots is tied up ,
manages to get away , stabs his abductor a couple of times ?
maybe somebody else was tied up here .
hey . you guys need to see this .
looks like it was used
as some sort of improvised torture chamber .
uh , there &apos;s a lot of blood . no more bodies .
we search the whole building ?
yeah . it &apos;s clear .
but we found this over in the corner .
it &apos;s a digital encryption key ,
like they have at banks .
we &apos;ll see if nina can track down the owner .
this place gives me the creeps .
these are pretty solid walls .
somebody could scream in here for hours ,
nobody &apos;d ever hear them .
so , our victim has a criminal record .
daniella gibbs .
what &apos;d she get picked up for ?
uh , mostly misdemeanors .
couple of drunk and disorderlies ,
and a minor possession charge .
all in atlanta .
anything local ?
no .
and i &apos;m not finding a boston address
or records of employment in the state , either .
okay . uh , let &apos;s call atlanta p.d. ,
see if they have anything more on her .
i &apos;ll give them a call .
hey , thanks .
did you hear from that computer genius you talked to at m.i.t. ?
he analyzed all the data
from the hacks on jane &apos;s bank accounts .
did you give him the videotape of the arson , too ?
i gave him everything .
he thinks he discovered the hacker &apos;s signature ,
a piece of code embedded in all his hacks
so he can take credit for them .
identifying that hacker might be the only way
that we find out who &apos;s behind all this .
i sent the code signature to the fbi
so they can run it against their hacker database .
they might be able to give us something to go on .
mm , keep me informed .
keep you informed of what ?
this is no longer an urgent kidnapping .
this is a plain , old @-@ fashioned police investigation ,
in which you are the victim .
sweet !
old @-@ fashioned investigations are my speciality .
you can &apos;t investigate your own case .
if you do , any decent defense attorney
will get whatever we find thrown out .
you need to trust us to do our job .
on a different note , i do have something
on that encryption key found at the murder scene .
it &apos;s a digital account authenticator .
the serial number for this one
is registered to an assistant manager
at first cambridge bank , perry shaw .
any criminal record ?
clean as a whistle .
and i just called --
he &apos;s at work today , so he wasn &apos;t another victim .
we should go talk to him .
yes , we should .
after you .
you find anything on that hacker , i want to know about it .
i &apos;m just looking out for the investigation .
i &apos;m not keeping secrets from you .
you &apos;re keeping a few secrets .
nope . i &apos;m an open book .
yeah ?
okay .
how do you , uh , propose that we approach this guy ?
you just want to ... engage him directly ?
whatever you think &apos;s best .
i @-@ i &apos;m not married to the idea .
okay . sounds good .
i just ... i &apos;ll see you then .
excuse me , mr. shaw ?
yes ?
boston p.d.
uh , we have something that you seem to have lost .
oh , my authenticator .
thank god . that was gonna be such a hassle to ...
wait , why do you -- why do you have it ?
where did you lose it ?
i &apos;m not sure , exactly .
i noticed it was missing on monday morning .
it was found in an abandoned building over on 2nd street .
that makes sense . that was kind of a crazy night .
mr. shaw , why were you in that building ?
the club ? like everyone else ?
the fear club .
you buy a ticket , they scare the hell out of you .
saturday night &apos;s was really intense .
are you telling us that this whole thing is a game ?
more like a personal theater event , uh ...
totally terrifying .
i screamed my ass off . it &apos;s fantastic .
so , just , can i have my authenticator back ?
no , you can &apos;t .
it &apos;s evidence in an ongoing investigation .
a murder investigation .
somebody got killed ? for real ?
yeah .
it &apos;s fantastic , right ?
what &apos;s up ?
well , the test results came back
on the &quot; blood &quot; we found from the scene .
it &apos;s actually a mix of cornstarch ,
red food coloring , and chocolate syrup .
hollywood blood .
basic recipe .
yeah , that matches what the banker &apos;s been telling us .
he said it was some kind of performance art ,
like a haunted house on steroids .
well , people love to be scared .
all that adrenaline and dopamine --
the fight @-@ or @-@ flight response can be very intoxicating .
yeah , if i want to get intoxicated ,
i &apos;m gonna have a beer .
there &apos;s enough horrible things out there .
i don &apos;t need to pay for the fake stuff .
has nina had any success on tracking down the hacker ?
i don &apos;t know . korsak &apos;s trying to keep me out of it .
well , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s doing what he thinks is best for the case .
so what am i supposed to do ? just sit around and wait
until whoever &apos;s behind this makes his next move ?
he &apos;ll make a mistake , and you &apos;ll be there to catch him .
i won &apos;t , if korsak won &apos;t let me in on the investigation .
i --
what about tattoo lady ?
unfortunately , there was no foreign dna
on her skin or under her fingernails .
the two stab wounds were made with a double @-@ edged blade ,
though the murder weapon was rather dull .
and the blows were delivered with a great deal of force .
so , a man ?
or a very strong woman .
i also found trace amounts of a chemical compound on the wounds ,
which i sent off to be tested .
any drugs or alcohol ?
none , though the liver did show advanced deterioration
consistent with excessive alcohol use .
one other thing .
we recovered dna from the strip of cloth found at the scene ,
and we ran it through the system .
no hits , but we were able to confirm
that it came from a female , but not daniella gibbs .
so we know at least two people were in the room
when she was murdered --
woman with the blindfold ,
a man who left a bloody boot print .
and we don &apos;t have an i.d. for either one of them .
no . i &apos;ve never seen her before .
she was there the same night you were .
if you say so , but i didn &apos;t see her .
i didn &apos;t see anyone because of the hood .
the hood ?
i had a hood over my head almost the entire time .
i was chained to the wall , could barely move ,
couldn &apos;t see anything .
this woman was yelling how she was gonna cut me in half .
had this buzz saw she kept bringing closer and ...
closer ...
i actually peed my pants .
sounds like money well spent .
how many people were there with you ?
no one . everyone goes in alone .
that &apos;s what makes it feel so real .
i mean , it &apos;s 100 bucks , but definitely worth it .
how do you contact this fear club ?
through their website .
but you got to have a password .
so , you ask for an invitation , see if they respond .
and what happens if they do ?
the night of the event , they send you an address
and an entrance time and a code word .
it &apos;s always someplace different .
and you have no idea who runs it ?
i told you , no . i swear , it &apos;s all anonymous .
then we &apos;re gonna need the website and the password .
yeah , we did a raffle in little league .
got a bunch of money for bats and mitts and things .
cool .
it was fun .
well , here .
i &apos;ll take 10 tickets .
really ? thanks . that &apos;s so nice .
it &apos;s for a good cause .
yeah . if we raise enough ,
the st. barnabus after @-@ school program can get a new playground .
that &apos;s so great .
did you say st. barnabus ?
um , thanks again . bye .
what a sweet girl .
um , did you find anything about the hacker ?
i did .
i was just on my way up to see sergeant korsak .
and ?
i know you think you want to know what &apos;s going on ,
but you don &apos;t .
because it might jeopardize the investigation .
and that &apos;s the last thing you actually want , right ?
fine .
here .
as a consolation , why don &apos;t you take these ?
maybe you &apos;ll win the grand @-@ prize trip to hawaii .
st. barnabus closed a year ago .
you &apos;ve been conned .
i think i may have something .
based on what the m.i.t. expert gave me ,
the fbi got a hit off their database .
what &apos;d they find ?
they discovered that same code signature
in several other hacks .
the oldest was three years ago ,
an online harassment case over in somerville .
did they identify the hacker ?
no . but i tracked down the victim ,
megan christenson .
she works at a café downtown .
i thought it might be worth talking to her .
why don &apos;t you interview her ?
oh , i haven &apos;t actually done field work since chicago .
you went out with jane recently .
only to back her up , not on my own .
she said you did great .
i know you originally took the assignment in bric
because you wanted to stay off the streets .
and because i like the work .
you &apos;re very good at it .
but i also get the feeling you &apos;re hiding in there .
my boyfriend got shot back in chicago .
he was killed on my beat .
was there anything you could have done ?
no .
then how about giving yourself a break ?
you &apos;re smart . you have great instincts .
i &apos;m not suggesting that we change your assignment , but ...
it might be time to exorcise a few of those demons .
yeah .
i got this .
thanks , sergeant .
you &apos;re welcome .
and , holiday ...
yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry .
hey . did you find anything on the owners ?
not yet .
the website &apos;s run by a dummy corp .
i subpoenaed the records , but it may take a few days .
well , keep pushing , &apos; cause we need the names
of everybody that was there that night .
well , the password that perry shaw gave us worked .
so i registered for an invite .
did you find anything online about this fear club ?
uh , not much . they fly under the radar .
but it was mentioned in a few blog posts ,
and it sounded pretty awesome .
do you mean &quot; awesome &quot; as in &quot; awe @-@ inspiringly stupid &quot; ?
come on .
you used to love horror movies .
oh , yeah . remember when we snuck into that revival
of &quot; night of the living dead , &quot; huh ?
i never heard you scream so loud .
shut up . you screamed so much louder than i did .
yeah . it was great .
uh , this is kind of like that .
scream a little , freak out , then go back to your normal life .
yes , but daniella didn &apos;t get to go back to her life .
maybe one of the guys that works there
got carried away with his role , took it too far .
maybe .
we won &apos;t know until we find the woman in the blindfold .
yeah .
it &apos;s kind of strange
that no one &apos;s reported daniella missing .
it &apos;s been almost a week .
i tracked down the guy that owns that building .
he lives in new york , says he &apos;s trying
to get the property rezoned so he can build condos .
did he rent it out to the fear club ?
no .
he thinks they must have broken in .
he has a security patrol that drives by occasionally ,
but they didn &apos;t notice anything .
oh . we got an invite .
click if you dare .
please .
god , i hate these guys already .
hate it .
hate that shit !
hate it !
that was pretty good .
according to the banker , you have only 30 minutes
to get to the fear club location after they contact you .
they use metal detectors , so you can &apos;t take your gun .
i &apos;ll be close by .
no problem .
and we need to catch at least one person
in the act so they don &apos;t all pretend to be guests .
toys from the drug @-@ unit guys .
we &apos;ve got a two @-@ way radio ,
plastic earbud that is completely undetectable .
cool .
as soon as you identify someone in charge , we &apos;ll come in .
detectives . i got the lab results back
on the chemical residue i found in the stab wounds .
it &apos;s polylactic acid .
acid ?
not the kind that burns .
it &apos;s a thermoplastic used in a variety of products--
surgical implants , disposable forks and knives , drinking straws .
i doubt she was stabbed with a straw .
no , but that means the murder weapon is made out of plastic .
like a prop .
yeah , like something an actor would use .
maybe it &apos;ll be zombies . that &apos;d be cool .
you &apos;re going undercover . you &apos;re not going on vacation .
yeah . i sure hope it &apos;s not spiders .
spiders ?
why would you say that ?
well , uh , people find spiders scary , that &apos;s all .
i wouldn &apos;t be at all surprised if it was spiders--
a big , ol &apos; web with hundreds of &apos; em .
it &apos;s not gonna be spiders .
you never know .
no spiders !
okay .
frankie , you &apos;re looking a little pale .
would you like me to check your blood pressure ,
make sure everything &apos;s okay ?
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine , maura .
that &apos;s hilarious .
spiders .
i don &apos;t like to talk about it .
i understand .
but i could really use your help .
there &apos;s nothing the police can do anyway .
at least , that &apos;s what they told me when it happened .
i &apos;m sure they did their best .
but maybe i can do more .
my accounts were hijacked .
my e @-@ mail , all my texts .
every stupid thing i &apos;d ever written was made public .
it was so embarrassing .
we all write things in private
we wouldn &apos;t want other people to read .
some of my friends never talked to me again .
and it didn &apos;t stop for months .
every time i got a new account , it got hijacked .
do you have any idea who was doing it ?
i told the cops .
but they said they couldn &apos;t find any proof .
who did you think it was ?
this weird guy in my public health class .
he kept asking me out , but i didn &apos;t want to go .
i finally told him to just leave me alone .
he got so pissed .
and then like a week later , all my e @-@ mails got released .
remember his name ?
riley .
riley keating .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna find riley ,
and i &apos;m going to have a talk with him .
hi , professor sullivan . this is jane rizzoli .
thank you for returning my call .
um , i would love to see the townhouse tonight ,
and 7 : 00 should be fine .
i &apos;ll be there , unless i hear differently from you .
seriously ? excuse me .
where did that little girl go ?
she just left .
she &apos;s raising money to help blind kids .
if you hurry , you might catch her ,
but i wouldn &apos;t count on winning that paris trip .
i &apos;m feeling pretty good about my chances .
this is the address .
backup &apos;s in position behind the building in case anybody bolts .
okay . i &apos;m going in .
code word .
disembowelment .
i heard that .
was it spiders ?
you the guy that runs this thing ?
&apos;cause we got some questions .
aw , man , no . not dani .
what was the nature of your relationship with ms. gibbs ?
she worked with me .
and ... we were kind of friends , too , i guess .
uh , you don &apos;t seem very sure .
well , i @-@ i liked dani , but she was tough .
she -- she &apos;d been through some hard times .
she was killed at your event . how could you not notice ?
i guess because she was downstairs with the kidnap / torture crew ,
and i was up on the roof murdering those nuns .
sure . makes perfect sense .
when she didn &apos;t show up at the end of the night ,
i looked through all the rooms where she &apos;d been working .
they all looked empty . i just figured she took off .
you didn &apos;t think to report her missing ?
honestly , we all thought that she probably went off on a bender .
she was a heavy drinker ?
used to be .
she &apos;d been sober about a year now ,
but she had fallen off the wagon before .
what exactly was her role that night ?
she was , uh , one of the sadistic kidnappers .
she would make these terrifying threats ,
and then the buzz saw was really loud .
so once people were good and scared ,
she would just leave them alone for a while --
you know , really build up the fear .
sounds like you &apos;ve got it down to a science .
more of an art .
were there any men playing kidnappers that night ?
two . oh , but they &apos;re just
acting students from the community college .
t @-@ they wouldn &apos;t hurt dani .
well , we &apos;ll need to talk to them .
and all of the participants from that night ,
especially the woman
who was blindfolded in that room with dani .
sure . uh , except i don &apos;t have the names of any of the guests ,
o @-@ only e @-@ mail addresses .
you -- you can have it all .
anything if it &apos;ll help you figure out who did this .
i have the perfect proposal idea .
oh , sorry . am i interrupting you ?
no . no , not at all .
um , there &apos;s coffee .
thank you .
so , i think vince should propose to kiki on a gondola
with italian music and romance in the air .
that &apos;s how i want to be proposed to !
where did frank propose to you ?
in the parking lot at sal falucci &apos;s bar .
okay , wait , wait , wait .
he was wearing his best suit .
oh , that &apos;s good .
well , i think gondolas are lovely .
but i am not sure that we can decide how korsak proposes .
yeah .
so , uh , catching up on some reading ?
yeah . some very interesting articles .
how are you doing ?
are you sleeping any better ?
mostly .
uh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine .
you went through hell . nobody expects you to be fine .
please don &apos;t say anything to jane .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want her worrying about me .
like you could ever stop her ?
but i , uh -- i understand .
you know how much i care about you , maura ?
i do .
so , how about you talk to me ?
we talked to all the actors
who were there the night of the murder --
mostly college students , none with any criminal record .
&quot; i &apos;m not a murderer , i just play one on the weekends &quot; ?
we &apos;ll keep digging , but nothing &apos;s jumping out .
there was one guy that worked in the basement with dani ,
but he &apos;s a size 9 shoe .
so , that &apos;s not our guy .
nobody knew of any problems she was having .
no ex @-@ boyfriends , no threats .
maybe dani wasn &apos;t the target .
maybe she was caught in the middle .
i may have something .
i ran all those e @-@ mail addresses you got from the fear club .
i focused on all the entrance times
that matched up to when dani gibbs disappeared .
okay , what &apos;d you find ?
one of the addresses was connected
to a restraining order that was issued two months ago .
assailant or victim ?
victim .
her name &apos;s karen hughes .
she &apos;s the director of a local preschool .
she filed against a former employee , gus brooks .
and what do we know about him ?
brooks has two priors for assault ,
both back in philadelphia .
got an address ?
last known is back in philly .
but this is the preschool that karen hughes runs .
okay . i &apos;ll grab frankie , and we &apos;ll go talk to her .
we should talk to philadelphia p.d. ,
have them do a drive @-@ by , see if he &apos;s still there .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
okay , thanks .
i think i found the hacker .
his name &apos;s riley keating , and he &apos;s here in boston .
you know where ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll send some uniforms to pick him up .
we &apos;re investigating a homicide .
a woman died that night .
oh , my god .
it was real ?
is there a place where we could talk ?
i had never done anything like that before .
honestly , my life here is pretty boring most of the time .
you would think with all these kids running around ,
it &apos;d be anything but boring .
i &apos;ve always loved that rush of adrenaline --
you know , roller coasters , zip @-@ lining .
i thought the fear club would be like that .
that poor woman . she saved my life .
can you tell us anything about the man that stabbed her ?
he wore a mask , like a scarecrow kind of thing .
do you know how tall he was , skin color , anything ?
uh , i only saw him from across the room , and it was dark .
uh , he was taller than her , though .
uh , two months ago ,
you filed a restraining order against a gus brooks ?
yes . uh , he worked here for a few months ,
doing maintenance and taking care of the grounds .
but i discovered that he lied on his application .
what &apos;d he lie about ?
his name , for starters . i mean , we knew him as jerry --
which i found out later was actually his brother &apos;s name .
he used that and his brother &apos;s social security number
to get the job .
when i learned that , i fired him immediately .
and he didn &apos;t take that well ?
he showed up here a few times ,
insisting he &apos;d been doing a good job .
he &apos;d yell from the street , frightening the children .
has he been around lately ?
no .
after i filed the restraining order , we never saw him again .
uh , he lives in philadelphia now .
how do you know that ?
he entered a residential treatment facility
for anger management .
he sent me these letters apologizing for his behavior .
he says it &apos;s part of the program .
the postmark says philadelphia .
this one was sent a week ago .
uh , if it &apos;s all right with you ,
we &apos;d like to put you into protective custody .
well , i run the school . i @-@ i can &apos;t just leave .
how about we leave an officer in a squad car right out front ?
good job tracking him down , holiday .
thanks .
it felt good being out again .
hate to be the kind of guy that says , &quot; i told you so , &quot; but ...
but you told me so .
and you were right .
you know , i almost left the force once ,
right after my second divorce .
yeah ?
yeah , i was so busy with the job ,
i didn &apos;t notice that my wife and i had drifted apart .
when she left , i blamed myself .
i couldn &apos;t shake the guilt , for months .
then i finally realized i can &apos;t change the past .
got to find a way to move forward .
it &apos;s not easy , though .
no .
but it gets a little better every day .
can &apos;t ask for more than that .
i suppose not .
is that him ?
that &apos;s him .
riley keating ? boston p.d.
where are you going ?
this party &apos;s just getting started .
hi . you talk to philly p.d. yet ?
yeah . they talked to gus brooks at his apartment .
he swears he hasn &apos;t been back to boston
since karen hughes filed the restraining order .
he have an alibi ?
not a good one -- home alone , watching tv .
but i also called the treatment center
where he &apos;s been doing his anger @-@ management program .
i &apos;m not sure he &apos;s our guy .
let me guess --
model patient , making remarkable progress ?
uh , he &apos;s been showing up three times a week
to his court @-@ mandated sessions .
uh , counselor confirmed he &apos;s been doing great .
still , it &apos;s only a six @-@ hour drive from philly to boston .
but if he &apos;s living there , how would he even know
that karen was going to the fear club that night ?
i don &apos;t know .
we still need to talk to him . can you get an address ?
yeah .
thanks .
i have no idea what you guys are talking about .
you set up the website that contained this video .
these people burned down a detective &apos;s home .
i hope they were insured .
you also hacked into detective rizzoli &apos;s bank account .
no , i didn &apos;t .
and i don &apos;t even know this detective ratatouille .
rizzoli .
you found the hacker .
nina and korsak brought him in .
he &apos;s not giving us anything , though .
no connection to joe harris ?
no connection to your kidnapping at all .
no connection to me . no connection to framingham prison .
he &apos;s too young to be the person behind all this .
i agree . joe harris was a
psychiatrist used to working with convicts .
when i heard him on the phone , he was talking to someone
he had a personal and trusting relationship with .
i don &apos;t believe he would have used that tone with this kid .
yeah , so that means this guy is just a keyboard for hire .
get comfortable . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
you guys got nothing on me .
and i could probably actually sue you
for , like , false &quot; arrest @-@ ment , &quot; or something like that .
we may not be able to prove you
hacked detective rizzoli yet ,
but we didn &apos;t arrest you for that .
three years ago , you hacked into the accounts
of a young woman named megan christenson ,
which is illegal .
you weren &apos;t as good then as you are now .
you left traces ,
which we tracked back to your personal accounts .
that was no big deal .
it was to megan .
and to the state of massachusetts ,
who shall be happy to give you 2.1 / 2 years
in the state penitentiary .
lucky for you , megan and i have a pretty good relationship .
she &apos;s agreed not to press charges
as long as you cooperate .
i don &apos;t really know that much .
tell us what you do know .
we &apos;ll find whoever &apos;s behind this .
i called him . i @-@ i saw the townhouse last night .
you did ? are you gonna take it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just -- i @-@ i &apos;m unsure about ...
jane .
uh , something weird just popped up in the fear club e @-@ mails .
what ?
i @-@ i found a second invitation
that was sent to karen hughes &apos;s office computer ,
but it was sent to a different e @-@ mail address .
well , who else has access to her computer ?
i called her . she said no one .
so somebody else at the school got an invitation ?
i saw one of those 3 @-@ d printers in the classroom .
the plastic that you found in the wound --
could that come from a 3 @-@ d printer ?
definitely . uh , the polylactic acid is biodegradable .
wait . you think that the killer printed the murder weapon ?
it would get through a metal detector .
and that would explain why the blade was dull .
3 @-@ d printers can &apos;t re @-@ create the honed edge of a knife .
we got to talk to karen .
uh , do we still have a uniform outside the school ?
yeah .
okay , call him and -- and tell him to find her .
stick with her until we get to her .
bye , maura .
maura !
kiki .
what a nice surprise .
surprise , yes .
uh , vince and i are gonna get something to eat .
can you join ?
oh , i really can &apos;t talk to you .
i mean i really can &apos;t talk .
i can &apos;t talk to anyone about anything .
just busy . busy , busy , busy girl .
well , that &apos;s too bad . maybe some other time .
yeah , love to .
bye !
okay . bye . yeah .
officer ellis . is everything okay ?
yes , ma &apos;am . just a precaution .
okay if i come in ?
i imagine that &apos;s detective rizzoli .
she needed to talk to you .
hello ?
hi , karen . it &apos;s jane rizzoli .
is everything all right , detective ?
i &apos;m not sure .
um , i @-@ if you could just sit tight until we get there --
karen ?
go , go .
he &apos;s alive .
anything ?
no . you ?
no , nothing .
frankie , get down !
thanks .
okay . it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s over .
okay ?
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
so , gus brooks was using a plastic key
that he made on the 3 @-@ d printer
to break into the school after he was fired .
looking for a way to get his revenge .
fear club was the perfect opportunity .
and then daniella gibbs got in the way
and saved karen &apos;s life .
hey , jane , uh , you were right .
there is something i &apos;ve been keeping from you .
what ? that you &apos;re gonna ask kiki to marry you ?
how did you know that ?
i &apos;m a detective . i know things .
uh , it -- it &apos;s fine . i get it .
it &apos;s your life . it &apos;s --
no , no , no . i wanted to tell you . i just ...
i thought talking about my marriage proposal
was insensitive .
why ?
why ? all the stuff that was going on --
maura &apos;s kidnapping , the attacks on you .
what -- so , you &apos;re worried about being happy ?
how are we supposed
to get through the shitty moments in life
if we don &apos;t have the happy ones to balance them out ?
so you &apos;re okay with it ?
yeah .
i &apos;m more than okay with it . i &apos;m thrilled .
okay ?
where you going ?
i got one more case to solve today .
yeah , it &apos;s for a really good cause .
mm . all right , well , i &apos;ll take 100 .
100 ? really ?
the orphans are gonna be so excited .
so excited .
you know , i think the only kid benefiting from this is you .
don &apos;t lie . i &apos;m a cop .
i just wanted a puppy .
a puppy ?
my mom said no , so i decided to raise the money myself .
well , honey , if your mom said no ,
then you can &apos;t have a puppy .
but it &apos;s not fair .
okay , well ,
maybe if you spent more time convincing your mom
and less time swindling people ,
you might get what you want .
you really think so ?
i think it &apos;s worth a try .
because this is over .
t @-@ there &apos;s my mom .
you &apos;re cynthia &apos;s kid ?
here , i &apos;ll make you a deal .
i &apos;ll give all the money i raised to the boys and girls club ,
and you don &apos;t tell my mom .
i &apos;ll make you a deal . you give me all the money you made ,
i &apos;ll give it to the boys and girls club ,
and i may not tell your mom .
deal . thanks .
do you really think
i can talk my mom into getting me a puppy ?
i think you can do anything you set your mind to .
you know , she reminds me of you when you were that age .
a thief ? !
cop , thief -- it could have gone either way .
just saying .
smart kid .
come on , vince . who doesn &apos;t love a gondola ?
ma , she could get seasick . you never know .
does she ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
you know what you should do ? you should propose to her
at fenway park when the sox are playing , you know ?
and -- and they put it
on the big jumbotron on the big screen ?
you want him to propose over a hot dog and beer ?
perfect , isn &apos;t it ?
a proposal deserves champagne and a string quartet .
i always thought getting engaged in a hot @-@ air balloon
sounded like fun .
or maybe you could just ask her .
longfellow bridge -- very romantic . yeah .
there &apos;s always the top of the hub .
unbelievable views .
what about a flash mob ? i love those .
oh ! you know what he should do ?
he should write her a song .
you should write her a -- where &apos;d he go ?
ye --
yes , of course ! yes !
i love you .
i love you , too .
she said yes !
oh , how sweet !
i love new beginnings .
i -- oh , speaking of , i took the townhouse .
you did ?
wait . you &apos;re moving out ?
yeah . first thing on monday .
drinks are on me .
here &apos;s to the future mr. and mrs. vince korsak .
congratulations ! congratulations !
