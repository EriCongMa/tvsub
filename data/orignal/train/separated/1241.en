Why are you here?
Police asked me to stay.
I'm talking about the funeral.
If Charlotte was as horrible as you told the judge she was,
why did you go? Did you lie in court?
Was it all an act, so you could walk out like a victim?
Do you have feelings for--
I don't even know if he feels the same way.
I think that you should find out.
You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.
I know you're lost right now.
I know you're, you're filled with anger
and you're full of despair--
What the hell are you talking about?
Charlotte. I know that you did this to protect me.
What the hell was Ezra doing there?
What's wrong? Who's that from?
It's from Detective Calderon.
They just confirmed that the tape was erased.
He needs to own up to what he did?
You're asking me to confess to a murder.
Where did you go that night after you left Aria?
Get out!
We're gonna leave.
But you two better figure this out.

我会让你开口的
艾瑞亚
You guys, I'm so sorry.
I was up late last night prepping for town hall meeting.
I turned my phone off.
我会让你开口的
Who the hell sent that?
我会让你开口的
Someone who has our new number.
Like Ali?
We all know I am at the top of her suspect list.
Maybe that's why Sara's hanging around.
She might not be able to cut around me
but she can still type a text.
So I'm guessing everything she told the judge
about Charlotte was a lie.
Maybe she came back here to mourn the death of her mentor
not her tormentor.
So we're-we're definitely saying that Sara's the stalker?
I'm telling you guys that bitch wasn't stockholmed.
'Well, the only thing we know for sure is that'
she has spent two years helping Charlotte torture us.
That's plenty of time to perfect the art of cyber stalking.
Or it could just be some techie at the phone company
with too much time on his hands.
God, I miss New York.
I am addicted to Blue Bottle Coffee.
One cup and you feel like you can handle anything
your boss throws at you.
Staplers, her phone--
You boss literally throws things at you?
Wait. What are you doing?
I lied to Lorenzo yesterday and he knows it.
I don't have any time to play games.
Like the techie's really gonna respond.
汉娜
Okay, the techie's typing.
"Yes."
So you're with Dr. Rollins?
Ah, sounds peaceful there.
Okay, well, give us a call if you need anything.
Bye.
So Alison's at the Rollins' family farm in Eastern Pennsylvania.
They're on a dairy tour right now.
If Ali's really tasting amish cheese
do you think she could be the cyber stalker?
If is a really big two letter word, Hanna.
Whoever this person is they think that we know
who killed Charlotte and they're sending us these texts
because they want us to rat that person out.
Okay, but we do know who killed her.
Don't we?
Ezra said he didn't do it.
Maybe that's what you heard, Aria,
but the rest of us heard
Ezra kick us out of his apartment.
Guys.
And every member of this police department is taking this case
not just seriously but personally.
Without going into detail that can harm the investigation
I can tell you that we are narrowing down
our list of suspects.
We're confident we know what the murder weapon was
and we will find it.
The person who killed Charlotte Dilaurentis
will be brought to justice.
Aria.
Oh, what's my dad doing here?
Looks like he got a room.
I didn't know he was seeing anyone.
Yeah, it's because they're doing it at the Radley.
It's a 9 iron.
You could kill somebody with that.
Do we really think that's a murder weapon?
Does Ezra play golf?
Hey, guys, enjoy!
Sabrina, hey!
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's Aria, right?
Yes. Hey!
Umm, uh, look, so I've been helping Ezra
out with his new book and I'm little worried.
He hasn't been answering any of my calls.
Ezra's out of town.
Are you sure?
I saw him leave, so yeah!
Do you know where he went?
When he gets like this, I've learned it's best not to ask.
Like this?
There is dark and brooding.
And then there's dark and depressed.
I would check that box for Ezra.
Look, he disappears a lot. He's usually back in few days.
Look, he-he didn't tell me he was going out of town
but I know that he finished the next chapter of his book
and I'm supposed to proofread the pages
before I e-mail them to my boss.
So...Could you just let me into the loft?
Please. Mate, my job is on the line here.
I hear you, Aria.
But if I let you into my boss' apartment
my job's gonna be on the line.
Sorry.
Thanks for making the coffee this morning.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to run to a breakfast meeting
and then...All of this.
You didn't sneak out because of--
No! God, no!
Last night was perfect.
Did you know that 89% of all young voters
when recently surveyed said that the recent economic slump
has forced them to put their life plans on hold?
Gil, what's up?
This was updated this morning.
候选人菲利普
It's everything you'd wanna know about
the Phillips' family and then some.
I will eat, live and breathe this. Thank you, Gil.
Wow. That is a thick file.
Yeah!
Okay, Candidate Phillips.
She gave the commencement speech at Wesleyan
before earning her JD at Georgetown.
Her favorite ice cream is actually sorbet
and she often binges on candy corn
while on the campaign trail.
Oh, candy corn?
That's a serious sugar addiction.
Yeah!
伊冯·菲利普
And here is the recon on her family.
I mean, we have to assume that they know as much about us
as we know about them.
I know it's a little awkward considering.
Yeah, you said Yvonne was nice, right?
Yeah, yeah, we've only hung out a couple of times
But...She seems okay.
Cool, umm, if I didn't think this town was small when I left
it certainly is now.
Hey, umm, I was, uh, thinking about taking a drive
to see Toby.
Yeah, I'm cool with that.
So since we, uh..
I.. Should I get my own place?
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
Look, I just need you to promise me one thing.
Okay.
I will always get the first cup of coffee in the morning.
Spencer
I promise I will not come between you
and your relationship with caffeine.
Thank you.
Wow! It's so short. You look hot.
Where are you?
I'm at the airport.
Babe, you're leaving early.
Mm-hmm. Is that a problem?
Never.
I'm gonna rent a car.
You got any preference?
Oh, you don't need one.
Lucas is letting us use his jag. Comes with a loft.
You wanna pick me up then?
In Philly?
I'm taking the company plane. We can land in Brookhaven.
I'll see you on the runway.
Company plane? That's fancy.
Umm, it's literally a private jet.
It's so nice.
Flying private makes the first class feel like coach.
It totally ruins you.
That's a high class problem to have.
Okay, so he's charming, handsome and he adores you.
I'm not seeing a downside.
Yeah, me neither.
What?
So how come you've been engaged for almost a year
but you haven't set a wedding date?
Well, I think I'm finally ready to do that.
I told Spencer it was okay if she and Caleb got together.
Wait, what? Back up.
Yeah, she likes him like that.
And does he like her like that?
She's Spencer. What's not to like?
You're really okay with that?
You know what?
Ever since I've been back here, all I've done is spin and twirl.
And with Jordan, I don't spin and I don't twirl.
He keeps me grounded and I really like how that feels.
So when's the wedding?
Well, I've been honest with him about everything in my life
but the other night, I lied to him
about sneaking out of the room to erase that tape.
Sorry that we asked you to do that.
I'm gonna tell my mom what happened and then..
...I'll tell Jordan and if he still wants to marry me
then I'm ready.
艾瑞亚
It's Aria.
Thanks.
So you're really doing this all by yourself?
Yvonne's been helping.
Please, I've banged my thumb more times than I've hit the nails.
Hey, Caleb.
Hey, how are you?
I'm with you, by the way.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, I can jack a mainframe
with a screwdriver, but you give me power tools
I am the dumbest guy in the room.
When my eyes see a power saw
my mind sees a finger with no hands.
Yeah, and a chainsaw takes me straight to no arms.
How about a wood chipper?
Fargo!
Fargo!
And I see mulch.
That's because you don't watch TV
or go to the movies with me.
That's not entirely true.
We stream.
Yes.
It's embarrassing, but we've been binging on "The Tonight Show."
Why is it embarrassing?
Fallon is hilarious.
What?
Yeah, you explain it.
If I'm late for this prep meeting my mom's gonna kill me.
I'll see you tomorrow at the town hall.
Yeah, I've heard you've joined the Hastings' campaign.
Yep.
What? You're-you're, you're working for Veronica.
I found out this morning.
Yeah, she is kind of a tough lady to say no to.
Well, I look forward to finally meeting Spencer.
Bye! Bye!
Wow, when I'm falling for a girl, I, uh
usually cook her a meal.
You are building her a house.
So how about you? You, uh..
you cooking for anyone?
Does that have to do with Hanna?
You're still holding on to that?
Uh, actually I connected with someone
a few years ago.
The timing wasn't right and it was just..
It-it felt really complicated.
It still is pretty complicated.
That's why I'm here.
For someone who's a straight shooter
you're really talking in circles.
It's Spencer.
We-we've just been spending a lot of time together
as-as friends and..
Look, if-if you're not okay with this, just say the word.
How does she feel about it?
I think the same.
Well, if it's what you both want, then it's not complicated.
Well, I guess we'll see how it goes.
You wanna put me to work?
I mean, I-I suck at power tools
but I can probably pound a few nails.
No, I gotta go. I'm meeting Yvonne's parents for lunch.
So I should probably go change.
Okay, well, thanks for the beer.
Okay.
Anytime.
I called his landline, I called his cell phone
I even called his little brother.
It's not like Ezra to just walk out on me like this.
But Sabrina said it kind of is like him now.
Aria, where's your off switch? You're gonna blow a circuit.
No. This is just level two. Do you wanna see level three?
Man, I miss yoga class. I miss Liam. I miss Boston.
I miss sanity, Emily.
Okay, Ujjayi Breath, Aria. Just breathe.
Better now?
No.
I need you to keep Sabrina busy
while I get the key to Ezra's.
Aria, I like her. I don't wanna lie to Sabrina.
Okay, fine, so just go, go buy her a cup of coffee.
You just said that you like her, so it shouldn't be that hard
to make a friendly conversation. There's no lying in that.
Okay, then we're deceiving her.
Emily, I'm sorry. I really am.
But I need to see if that 9 iron is missing from Ezra's clubs.
Aria, I'm trying to get my life together, okay?
I wanna do the right thing, not move two steps back.
I understand that, but if Ezra killed Charlotte...
Breaking and entering, it's a crime.
We're not stealing anything.
Okay, fine.
But what do we do if Ezra did kill Charlotte?
Do we text a photo of him to our new cyber bully Sara Harvey?
No, but at least we'll know what we're up against.
候选人菲利普
伊冯·菲利普
九月二十五出生
Hey, honey. I didn't know you were coming.
I was just headed out to the hotel to meet with Spencer.
This town hall is turning out to be
quite a nice little event for us.
I erased the security footage from the hotel
the night Charlotte was murdered.
Oh, Hanna.
We had nothing to do with what happened to her
but... now it looks like we could have.
Okay, so you don't have a TV,
you don't have a cell phone and you don't have a computer?
Not even a Facebook account.
Sorry, but Twitter is the new Facebook
and now Snapchat's the new Twitter
but Periscope might be the new Snapchat.
This is why I stay unplugged.
Umm, so what prompted your social media blackout?
When I got sick, I realized that someday I will disappear.
But while I'm still here, I want people to see me
the actual me, not the me on some web page.
So does that work? Do people see the real you?
Well, you're here having coffee with me.
You didn't text, you didn't send an e-mail.
Sabrina, I have to tell you something.
You make a perfect Cappuccino.
Do you wanna live dangerously and have one more?
I'll step out on the ledge with you.
Hanna, why couldn't you have just left it alone?
I screwed up.
I know that. But I did it for Aria.
You're not in high school anymore.
You don't owe them anything.
But they're still my friends.
And what's the big deal? No evidence, no crime, right?
The security company we use backs up all of our tapes
to a hard drive that they store at some place called the Farm.
If the police get a hold of that drive
they'll see that Aria left the hotel
and they'll know that you're the one who erased the footage.
Can we go to the Farm? Can we get it before they do?
No, Hanna. We can't.
Ezra?
Five, six, seven..
Hey, Gil.
Hey.
Look, uh, Ashley's running late
but we can still walk through the event.
So you and Yvonne are gonna be sitting here.
We're expecting a decent turnout
so we're gonna get some extra chairs.
The event's gonna have an informal feel.
Hopefully sparking, uh, audience participation.
Possibly a lively impromptu debate between you and Yvonne.
I'm sorry. A debate?
Only if it comes naturally.
Now you might get a question on Lafeyette.
It's okay. Answer naturally.
Just do not pretend to know something that you don't know.
That's how you wind up a viral video. Okay?
Spencer?
Yeah. It's great.
Great. Excuse me.
Uh, no, no, no. No, no. Chair goes over there.
Ezra, hi, it's Stephanie from Habitat.
I'm back in the states. Let's grab a coffee.
Ezra.
Dad?
I have to talk to you about...
well, about what you think you saw that night.
This was amazing, but I'm...I'm usually not terrified,
But these planes were so much smaller--
Em, Em, can I borrow you?
Yeah, I'm just in the middle of a conversation right.
It's urgent.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Just need to talk to my friend, that's all.
Uh, so rain check on the rest of your Haiti adventure?
Yeah, sorry about all this.
I used to mellow out with weed. Just saying.
Thanks.
Okay, so what'd you find?
Em, I-I think my dad might have had something
To do with Charlotte's murder.
I'm sorry, Jordan.
More about lying to you than erasing that tape.
I totally get it if you don't wanna marry me.
You actually think I'd let something like this
come between us?
Yes, you screwed up, but...
you're protecting a friend.
And that is one of the many things I love about you.
You're the most loyal person I've ever met.
That's why I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Blow.
Uh, do you seriously want a wife
that you might have to visit behind six inches of glass?
You're not Hannibal, Hanna.
People screw up, that's why lawyers have jobs.
We can get ahead of this.
But you're gonna have to be honest about everything
from now on, okay?
Okay. I'm gonna call my dad.
I'm sure he has some connections in Philly.
Do you really have to tell pappy?
Hanna, my family loves you. It's gonna be okay.
Hey, dad, it's me.'
Yeah, good. Umm, uh, I've got a quick favor to ask.
I got another text too.
What'd yours say?
Why are you whispering?
Because Jordan's here.
Well, did you tell him about it?
Because I really wanna tell Caleb.
Because he's Caleb or...because you guys are...
You know what, Hanna.
Look, if you're really not okay with this--
Wow, that was fast.
It's never gonna happen again, okay?
I swear it.
You know what, that was just a knee-jerk reaction.
It's fine, Spencer, really.
I told Jordan I erased the tape.
But I'm afraid to tell him about that text.
I mean, this person threatened to blow us up.
My-my brain is telling me to be honest, but...
my PTSD is telling me to shut the hell up.
Let me get Caleb on this.
Maybe he can shut this down
And then you can tell Jordan everything.
Okay. Do it, Spencer.
There's something that you need to see.
Caleb's making progress.
He says that the signal's bouncing
through several proxy servers
But he's been able to spoof the IP address
and backtrace it to an encrypted connection.
What does that mean?
I'm not entirely sure.
But he does think that he's zeroing in
on the location of the source.
Okay, let's say it's coming from the Radley,
can he narrow it down to the room?
He doesn't really have to
I mean, if we're right about Sara
She's the only person who's staying at the Radley
who spent two years in Charlotte's school for stalkers.
Umm, can you just call me back after you talk to Aria's dad?
Yeah.
Hi. Congratulations on the engagement.
Oh, my gosh, it's so good to see you..
Spencer, hi. I'm Yvonne.
Oh, sorry, we're a family of huggers.
And Toby's told me so much about you.
Yeah, you're an impressive woman yourself.
Top of your class, double major at Smith. Wow.
So they gave you a packet on me too?
Yeah. Sorry, I had to read that.
Well, me too.
DC must be missing its brightest young lobbyist.
You know as well as I do that a campaign is won or lost
in the last three weeks, so..
...I'm not gonna get another vacation day
for the next three years of my life, but I thought
it was important for me to be here for my mom.
Yeah, I've heard you're not a fan of Rosewood.
I, uh, I told Yvonne that
I was Green Acres and you were Park Avenue.
后者的女主角也有个厉害的姐姐
Green Acres?
He's just kidding. We watch a lot of retro TV.
Oh, god, I'm getting a ticket. Sorry.
Oh, yeah, fine.
So you saw the ring earlier?
Yeah, I mean, I-I wasn't trying to be
a crazy ex-girlfriend stalker.
I just, I was there.
It's a small town. We're gonna run into each other.
So you didn't propose?
Officer Toby, can you help me out with this?
Nice meeting you, Spencer.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
He's not here.
But his car's parked right outside.
Hello.
Dad...I need to talk to you.
It's not a good time, Aria. I'm in a meeting.
This can't wait.
I'm sorry, I-I really have to go.
I'll call you later. I love you.
He hung up on me.
I think she knows.
Something's really wrong.
Where are you going with this?
You went to see her?
Yes, Byron. I did.
Why on earth would you go see her?
I...enough, okay? Please.
She kidnapped and tortured our daughter.
I went to visit her today to hear Charlotte's story.
After I asked you not to go.
She did terrible things, Byron. Terrible.
And I wanted to know why. I needed to know why.
Okay. Why did she do it?
They put her in that horrible place when she was just a child.
And they never came back to get her.
I mean, can you even imagine?
I don't want to imagine, okay? I don't need to know why.
I just need to know that she's gonna stay locked away
and never hurt Aria again.
Charlotte's doctors say she's improving.
That she's rebalancing after all the years of neglect.
Wait. Are you saying that they may let her out?
That's a decision for the court.
Well, I'm not interested in the court.
Charlotte Dilaurentis will walk the streets of Rosewood
over my dead body.
I'm calling him back.
Wait.
Where does your Dad keep his golf clubs?
In his car.
Wait, I-I used to keep an extra set of keys somewhere.
Em?
I forgot to put this back.
The good news is you didn't kill Charlotte.
But you faked an alibi and you tampered with evidence
in a murder investigation.
Those are serious offenses.
I'm screwed, aren't I?
Only if they can prove you did it.
But I did do it.
I'm the only person you're gonna tell that to.
I'm very good at my job, Hanna, but I can't protect you
unless you tell me everything you know.
There can't be any surprises when they're questioning us.
Hanna, that's it, right?
You've told us everything?
Yeah. You know everything I know.
You and Yvonne going camping?
She's got a lot on her plate right now.
Like you.
Oh, so you're pulling a Toby.
Spence, we're not an us anymore.
You don't get to weigh in on my life.
I just thought that we found a way to be friends.
Honestly..
it was a lot easier being your friend
when you lived in D.C.
Toby, you know that I can't go anywhere right now, okay?
The cops are asking us a hundred questions and..
I am really helping my mom with this campaign.
I get it, Spence.
Why is it so easy to fall back into old habits?
They're hard to give up.
That's what makes them habits.
I'm sorry, Toby.
Don't apologize. Nobody did anything wrong.
Well, are you at least gonna stay for tomorrow's event?
I'm sure Yvonne's counting on you.
I'll be there.
You got right about this intersection
Why was it so easy to track down that signal?
And also why build a firewall if it's so easy to break down?
I was just hoping you were gonna tell me
all these texts were coming from the Radley.
Hmm, so we could break into Sara's room
and kick her ass together?
You know what they say.
The couple that kicks ass together..
That was an attempt at a non-sarcastic joke.
Didn't, didn't really make it.
I actually, I wanted to ask you something.
Already?
Why did you delete that text about Toby?
You saw it?
Spencer, I'm a professional. It's kind of what I do.
I don't know, I just..
this was new and I didn't want it to get complicated.
I just wanted things to stay new and easy.
Okay.
I get that.
hey, Emily.
I didn't wanna think that's what happened..
No, no, no. I...
we were just trying to help Ezra.
You and his ex-girlfriend Aria?
But it's not what it looks like.
There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.
You don't have to do that. We won't--
And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.
I did. I do--
Life is short, Emily.
Save your lies for someone who has time to hear them.
Sabrina, you don't have to do that.
Remember to use as few words as possible
when answering his questions.
Yes, no and I don't recall.
That's all that needs to be said.
He's gonna know I'm lying.
It doesn't matter if he can't prove it.
It's okay, you're not in this alone.
Hanna, you're free to go. At least for now.
Wait. Why? What happened?
The security company lost the Radley backup drive.
They lost it?
You didn't do that, did you?
No.
Let's get out of here.
No lock.
而是隐藏在光天化日之下
It's happening again... isn't it?
Four, five, six, seven, eight, ni..
All my friends turn out for national elections
but most of us don't even know
when our local elections are held.
Or really who our local representatives are.
Until my mom got involved in the campaign, I didn't.
Is young voter turnout low because we don't care to ask?
Or is it because we're confused and we're skeptical?
A lot of politicians came to power
on the backs of rich donors.
They like it when you're confused and cynical.
Yvonne's right.
For them, the less you know, the less you care.
So they get to make a lot of the big decisions for you.
But we do have access to information
and we wanna help you find it.
We're on opposite sides of this campaign
but on this issue, we stand together.
If you don't vote, you don't have a voice.
Are you okay with opening this up to questions?
Absolutely, Spencer.
If you guys have any questions
we'd be really happy to answer them.
Yeah?
Hanna, your mom just got into the elevator.
It's a go?
We need to find out if Ezra's hiding out with my dad.
She's logged out. I don't know her password.
Not really my department.
Hanna can't figure out her mom's password.
Umm, okay, what was the name of your first pet?
Guppy.
You named a guppy Guppy?
I was two.
Uh, try your birthday.
I'm in.
Okay, I'll call you if she comes back down.
Hey, Caleb.
Yeah?
I'm really glad about Spencer.
I mean, that she told you about the texts.
Yeah, me too.
Whoever it is, they were expecting us.
They meaning Sara?
You saw her that night at Radley.
Sara wasn't just wearing that red coat, she was rocking it.
The more I think about it, the more I think
that everything she told that judge was a lie.
Sara wasn't forced to play the game. She wanted to.
Maybe you're right, but there's someone else
who's seeking justice for Charlotte.
Are you absolutely sure that Alison's out of town?
I'm not absolutely sure about anything anymore.
Aria, guys don't always have full sets of golf clubs.
Maybe your dad never had a 9 iron.
And that just happens to be the club this not A has?
I was trying to be a calming influence, Emily.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Neither your dad or Ezra are staying here.
Wait, what about Sara?
She put a do not disturb sign on her door two days ago
and she instructed the staff
to not go in her room when she's gone.
What is she doing in there?
I'll take building a lair for 300 alex.
Be inspired to create the future you imagine by voting.
What it really comes down to you guys is this.
Nothing's ever gonna change
unless you make your voice heard.
Thank you so much for joining us.
That was fun.
That really was fun.
Oh, excuse me one second.
Yeah.
I like her.
She's one of a kind.
I'll stay out of your way, okay? I promise.
You were right yesterday.
Leaving would have been a mistake.
Look, I know it's hard for all of us being back here.
We've to force ourselves to remember
that we're not the people that we once we were.
But-but it's temporary, right?
I mean, you are eventually going back to DC.
Yeah, they want me back the second the election's over.
How did I do?
Guys?
We were so busy looking at the murder weapon
that we didn't notice--
The carpet.
You know, my mom spent weeks trying to match
the uniforms to those colors.
So the person who sent this is staying at the Radley.
Just like Sara Harvey.
It's my dad.
Answer it.
Answer it.
Dad?
Hey, Aria.
I know that you're with your friends right now
but I need to see you alone.
