hey , all y &apos;all . what &apos;s going down ?
my opinion of you .
what &apos;s with the fake glasses ?
as an actual glasses wearer , this is offensive .
it &apos;s like non @-@ disabled people who park in handicapped spaces .
i was in and out in three minutes , young lady ,
and it was your stye medication i was picking up .
that &apos;s a lot of bracelets there , buddy .
just ignore them . they &apos;re being sheep .
if i &apos;d listened to what other people said ,
i &apos;d never have rocked my &apos; 90s frosted tips .
we &apos;ve got pictures .
no , we don &apos;t .
you &apos;re an original , son .
when they made you , they broke the mold .
what &apos;s good , l.d. ?
yo , will .
luke , um , there &apos;s no easy way to ask this .
are you in a boy band ?
so , we &apos;re gonna go hang at the pier .
you in ?
sounds cool , but i don &apos;t know if i can .
that &apos;s right . we got a big day planned .
he &apos;s coming to work with the old man .
sorry .
next time .
deuces .
deuces .
word to your mothers .
seriously , david . tell your mom i say hi .
there she is -- our little genius .
look at my conscientious little girl
getting ready to leave for college a whole day early .
i &apos;m leaving today .
what ?
no .
no , no . no , no . we have a plan .
i @-@ i was gonna make your favorite meal for dinner ,
and then we were gonna fight because of separation anxiety ,
and then tomorrow morning ,
we would make up before you leave for good .
i just -- -oh ! no , no ,
guys , this is exactly why i didn &apos;t tell you !
but i can &apos;t take you . i have a showing .
i was gonna burn a cd of goodbye songs for the ride .
i have never felt better about a decision .
look , i &apos;m only 30 minutes away ,
and i &apos;ll be back in a couple of weeks .
i already asked haley to take me .
well , i better get going .
you may each hug me for five seconds .
i want you to know that you &apos;ll always be my little girl .
goodbye , nor--
time &apos;s up . mom .
i am so proud of you ,
and i know you &apos;re gonna achieve great things in this world ,
and i just read about this new nail polish that changes colors
if you dip it in a drink that has a roofie --
next .
i &apos;m good .
all right , cool .
well , i will text you guys when i get there .
i &apos;m taking his five seconds .
it &apos;s a tragedy -- no other way to put it .
such a beautiful day , too .
we just have to accept that lily has a soccer game
and we all have to be there .
you were supposed to make an excuse .
i &apos;m sorry !
i ran into cam at the market .
he asked if we could go . i panicked .
i shot myself in the foot .
oh , yeah , you shot yourself on your foot ,
you put your foot in your mouth ,
you put the shoe in the wrong foot .
what is with you americans and the foot ?
i hate that painting , by the way .
i &apos;m having the last cronut . i &apos;m so depressed .
i &apos;m sorry , kid . i think andy ate it .
so the game starts at 2 : 00 , right ?
jay ate the last cronut .
no one likes a tattletale , kid .
thank you , baby , for being so honest .
so we should leave in about an hour .
what is this &quot; we &quot; ?
i have to go and register joe for the winter camp .
mommy &apos;s going to buy shoes .
i did not raise a rat !
nobody gets out of this .
world &apos;s worst sport , world &apos;s worst players of it .
22 girls in a cluster
zig @-@ zagging across a field like a busted roomba .
except the only thing it sucks up is two hours of my life .
behold , the unsellable house .
two years on the market ,
it &apos;s crushed the soul of every real @-@ estate agent in town .
todd and terry taylor , the spouses selling houses --
they &apos;re no longer either .
i used to love going to work with my dad
to his grocery store , frank &apos;s food town .
i got to watch him crack up the deli team
by pretending to lose a finger ,
or he &apos;d pull out an orange from the pyramid
and somehow , it wouldn &apos;t fall .
i don &apos;t care what the sign out front said --
savings wasn &apos;t king . my dad was .
you know , with alex leaving ,
you and i are gonna get to spend a lot more time together .
wait .
what the whatsit ?
those are duck eggs .
cool . so --
remember how you and i used to talk about raising ducklings
and building them a little bird circus ?
kind of .
how long do you think we &apos;re gonna be here today ?
i like where you &apos;re going with this --
make it a time challenge .
i think i can get her done
in under five hours .
that &apos;ll leave us time to get to the trampoline park .
oh , and surprise .
we &apos;re going to the trampoline park .
boing !
his life will be rem--
no .
so , busy time at the house lately .
fun busy .
i &apos;ve taken on some work
helping people with estates and wills .
it &apos;s sadder than i thought it would be .
fun sad .
no , no , don &apos;t shoot !
bang , bang , bang , bang !
oh , no !
i &apos;m dying ! i &apos;m dying !
meantime , i &apos;m running a side business we started
doing short @-@ term rentals on our unit upstairs .
we call ourselves the artful lodgers .
mitchell , by any chance
when you were filling out the new rental agreement ,
did you forget to mark no pets , or , specifically , dogs ?
sorry , sorry , ooh !
you remember the donaldsons ?
this is a vanderkoff .
you know , s @-@ some couples might feel the strain
and take it out on one another .
but not the artful lodgers .
this morning was tough .
there , there .
and whenever you &apos;re ready , there and there .
girls . no , no , no .
not a good time , not a good time .
wasn &apos;t daddy supposed to be driving you to our game ?
daddy &apos;s been a little bit busy himself dealing with linens
that no guest has ever called scratchy before .
is there a way to make the room not so cold ?
do you know what it &apos;s like to wake up
next to your husband one morning and he &apos;s cold as ice ?
yes .
yeah , i &apos;ll work on that while you eat breakfast .
did you make the french toast ?
yes , it &apos;s right on the counter .
that &apos;s french toast .
what &apos;s happening ?
i wanted regular toast for the french people .
surely there was a better way to describe that .
he &apos;s allergic to eggs , mitchell .
wh-- okay , w @-@ why did you eat that ?
why -- why did he eat that ?
okay , maybe we should finish this up another time .
and just so you know
i do -- i do work on referrals .
here is a room you &apos;re going to love --
your very own man ca--closet .
man closet .
who loves , uh , basements ?
that &apos;s a rhetorical question .
have i got a basement for you .
watch your step coming down .
because it &apos;s a finished basement ,
you can actually count the square --
i don &apos;t think this house is kid @-@ friendly .
well , you said it yourself
when we were taking the towrope up the driveway .
this -- this house looks like a weird spaceship .
kids love spaceships .
don &apos;t they , luke ?
yeah .
i remember one day , i was around luke &apos;s age ,
and i wasn &apos;t all that happy to be at food town ,
but my dad knew exactly what to do .
he gets on the p.a.
and he says , &quot; attention , shoppers , &quot;
and then he hands the mike to me .
i was like , &quot; what ? &quot;
&quot; red wing peanut butter -- $ 1.69 for two . &quot;
he lost a lot of money on that sale ,
but it &apos;s a rush i &apos;ll never forget .
it &apos;s like being on a submarine , right ?
you guys , uh , fans of tom clancy ?
you know what ? luke &apos;ll finish the tour .
it &apos;s the office .
it &apos;s not ringing .
this is your moment .
hello ?
follow me , i guess .
how did we get on the second floor ?
isn &apos;t it great ?
there &apos;s an imperceptible rise .
so you guys can either reverse course
or take turns sliding down the fireman &apos;s pole .
luke &apos;ll show you .
h @-@ hang on .
but because you wouldn &apos;t let mom and dad cry over you ,
that emotion is gonna build up
and explode all over luke and me .
i &apos;m sorry . i just couldn &apos;t want .
do you know how long i &apos;ve been dreaming about this day ?
leaving your family ?
don &apos;t turn it into an insult .
i &apos;m just really ready for this .
i &apos;m finally surrounded by smart , curious people .
okay .
so , i &apos;m gonna go .
hi ! you must be alex .
i &apos;m your roomie . i &apos;m maisie .
my dad says it &apos;s short for amazing , but it &apos;s not .
wait , i @-@ i picked a different -- - roommate , i know .
she got sick -- well , she had a panic attack .
i can sympathize . i usually get one right before my cycle .
anyways , they denied her visa and she &apos;s still in norway .
&quot; help ! there &apos;s norway out . &quot;
how old are you ?
i &apos;m 15 , but i &apos;ve seen four r @-@ rated movies already .
i &apos;m so excited you &apos;re here .
where should i put my medicines ?
yeah , so you are good to go . i &apos;m fine .
oh , not quite yet .
so , maisie , do you speak any languages ?
si , oui , da , ja , and of course i also speak wookiee .
ahh ! that is gonna be so much fun !
yay !
they &apos;ve been here 2 days and they &apos;ve used 18 towels ,
yet the soap is untouched .
what are they -- sloughing each other clean like elephants ?
mitchell . great , you &apos;re here .
coach chuck had a death in the family .
thank you so much for remembering about the referrals .
i don &apos;t have a card on me right now , but --
no . he can &apos;t come ,
and since you &apos;re the assistant coach ,
you &apos;re in charge .
okay .
think you &apos;re gonna be okay with that ?
assistant coach , coach . what &apos;s the big diff ?
well , as an actual coach , um , diff .
come on , today &apos;s about being out in the fresh air ,
forgetting about our problems at home ,
spending some quality time with the family .
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
where is my family ?
you don &apos;t think they &apos;re standing us up , do you ?
you know , when i saw jay at the grocery store
and asked him if they were coming ,
he took a sample meatball and chewed it for a full minute
before he said yes , so ...
you all are still here .
how often do you break in here ?
does that explain the white wine ?
we fired a cleaning lady .
listen , i thought you guys
would already be at lily &apos;s soccer game ,
and things have been pretty emotional at my house this morning .
i just wanted a couple hours by the pool .
claire must have left the ice bucket by the jacuzzi , too .
i will write the cleaning lady a letter .
how &apos;d you get out of lily &apos;s game ?
i lied and said that alex was leaving for school today ,
which turned out to be true , so i &apos;m off the hook .
you guys let me know what i miss .
could you get that ?
yello ?
claire ?
what are you doing there ? we &apos;ve been waiting --
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i don &apos;t believe this .
they want more towels . what are they , midwives ?
here .
just ignore it .
how many phones does he have ?
pick up . anybody . i --
you know , i could get more phones .
he &apos;s never gonna stop .
mitchell , hi . hey , can &apos;t talk .
i &apos;m just leaving my house right now with alex .
i know you &apos;re at dad &apos;s house .
yeah , okay . um , look .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything . dad got in an accident .
he &apos;s fine . nothing to worry about ,
but i got to go . bye .
that was pathetic .
let me show you how it &apos;s done .
hello , mitchell .
so i hear my dad had a little accident ?
yes , of course , well , the accident that your father had
is that actually he shot himself
in the foot .
trust me . he believed me .
you &apos;re not listening to any phone ringings right now ,
are you ?
so , this is turning into
a whole group thing by the pool .
our pool .
you guys , i just got a text from cam .
give me that .
&quot; gosh , i sure do hope jay &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s unbelievable something like that could have happened . &quot;
you &apos;re welcome .
fantastic .
it &apos;s perfect .
we &apos;re all good .
well , you guys , you might want to listen again ,
only this time , i &apos;ll be cam .
&quot; gosh , i sure do hope jay is all right . &quot;
it &apos;s unbelievable something like this could happen . &quot;
we &apos;re screwed .
okay , they &apos;re coming ,
but can you believe they were gonna bail ?
keep your -- keep your eyes down . eyes down .
have we missed a single one of their kids &apos; events ?
and it &apos;s not like we don &apos;t have a million things going on right now .
follow through !
yeah , like when we had to sit through that
sanitized fifth @-@ grade production of &quot; rent &quot;
即使在艾滋病的阴影下 仍在努力求生存
where they all got head colds ?
keep your leg straight . keep your leg straight for me .
cam , can you not do that ?
what ?
well , it &apos;s just that , you know , i &apos;m kind of coach , so --
it just seems weird that this is the time
that you &apos;re trying to help me .
okay , and in what way am i not helpful ?
okay , well , when i &apos;m with a bereaved client , say ,
and you decide that that &apos;s the perfect moment
for a scenery @-@ chewing death scene .
unlike the tremendous help you &apos;ve been to me
running the artful lodger .
you couldn &apos;t even register the domain name .
i never liked that name , anyways .
and there it is .
i see what this is .
what ?
jealousy .
yeah ! yeah .
&apos;cause your football team can &apos;t seem to win ,
but here i am 4 @-@ 0 .
okay , please . yeah .
this is little girls &apos; soccer .
it &apos;s not even a real sport .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave .
oh , no , i was just --
let &apos;s not do this the hard way .
it &apos;s the worst of everything .
we have to go to the damn game .
and they &apos;re never gonna believe any of our excuses
in the future , even if they &apos;re real .
unless ...
why do you do that ?
why do you say &quot; unless &quot; and then pause ?
just finish the thought .
unless jay really gets shot in the foot .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this , once again ,
in only seven years of marriage ,
but please put the gun down .
don &apos;t be a baby .
it &apos;s a pellet gun .
it &apos;s just going to be a little nick on the side ,
and then we go to the game .
they &apos;re gonna see that it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re gonna feel horrible because they didn &apos;t believe us ,
and then we don &apos;t have to go to anything for a whole year .
i have to say , it makes sense .
no , it doesn &apos;t !
why don &apos;t i just bandage my foot up and limp on in there ?
no , no , no , no , no .
it has to be real because if they catch us faking it ,
it &apos;s going to be worse .
please don &apos;t point the gun at me .
okay , all right , all right . you heard my dad .
put the gun away .
we just -- we &apos;ll have to think of something else .
what to do ?
shoot , shoot , shoot .
okay , i &apos;ll put the gun away .
no !
no ! you did that on purpose !
i wasn &apos;t even looking !
i turned my back on you . i &apos;m so sorry !
watch the sippy cup .
i hope you &apos;re a heavy metal fan
because all the heavy metals
are going right here above your trophy .
cool . maisie .
so , i heard they &apos;re giving out mailbox keys downstairs ,
and i was thinking maybe you could pick up both of ours ?
sure thing , friend !
what a day -- i &apos;ve got a mailbox and a friend !
you sure do .
could you try not to enjoy this so much ?
this is me trying .
this ends now .
what are you doing ?
what do you think i &apos;m doing ? i &apos;m getting rid of her .
i &apos;m calling my advisor and getting a new roommate .
no .
give that back .
need i remind you i am a yellow belt ?
i can &apos;t keep track of all your ugly belts ,
but i don &apos;t think you should change roommates .
listen , as much as you &apos;re my go @-@ to girl on college advice ,
i really -- - oh , my god .
would you just shut up for a second ?
here &apos;s the thing --
i had a similar experience with a roommate .
she was this annoying little know @-@ it @-@ all
who totally got on my nerves .
yeah , i get it .
oh , shh !
i spent a long time trying to get rid of her
until i realized that that little girl ,
in her own way , put me on a pedestal .
it felt great .
you just landed in a world of superstars ,
and i know you &apos;d never admit it ,
but you &apos;re scared .
it &apos;s not the worst thing to have your own personal cheerleader .
i miss mine already .
well , i guess my five seconds is up .
you don &apos;t often see a 5 / 8 bathroom ,
but they &apos;re highly sought after .
the deal &apos;s in the bag , kid .
i &apos;m just gonna wrap it up , and then we bounce .
and then we bounce .
trampoline park .
how are you not high @-@ boinging me right now ?
i was thinking of maybe
meeting up with my crew at the pier .
sure thing . after we tramp .
fine .
after a while , i stopped hanging out with my dad at the store .
i got busy with cheer practice ,
and i guess pyramids of oranges don &apos;t seem so great
after you &apos;ve built pyramids out of man .
i don &apos;t know if it bothered him that i stopped coming around ,
but if it did , he never let it show .
all right . let &apos;s do this .
actually , i think i , uh --
i twisted my ankle
jumping out of the way in that room full of murphy beds .
i probably shouldn &apos;t get on a trampoline .
you should go hang out with your friends .
really ?
yeah .
might be faster if they come get you , though .
i should do one more sweep of the house .
i think i lost the blanstons .
thanks , dad .
deuces .
let &apos;s go , girls !
pass and move !
the players should never be standing still !
the best defense is good offense .
well , now , that can &apos;t be true .
halftime !
okay , good -- good half !
all right , we &apos;re down by three , but that &apos;s okay .
look . look who finally showed up .
not easily .
as you can see , i have a severely injured foot .
where is cam ?
he -- he got banished by the ref .
how did that happen ? be specific .
who cares ?
the important thing is i did , in fact , shoot myself in the --
save it . don &apos;t add insult to fake injury .
fake .
yeah .
seriously ?
say hello to his little toe .
oh , my god . you really
shot myself in the foot .
yeah , it was so scary .
and the blood .
there was so much blood .
but you guys -- you still showed up anyway .
of course !
without a doubt .
mommy shot jay .
i &apos;m sorry , what ? i thought you said --
yeah , mommy shot jay . aunt claire said , &quot; shoot him . &quot;
dad .
you would rather take a bullet than support your granddaughter ?
this was really gloria &apos;s idea .
i &apos;m surrounded by rats .
mitchell , listen to me .
i know &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; barely covers it ,
but it &apos;s very difficult for me to come here today
and watch little girls playing soccer
on the same day that my little girl left for college .
well , me too .
i mean , watching my little grandbaby go off --
don &apos;t jump on my thing .
sorry to interrupt .
so , the parents and nannies voted ,
and we &apos;re going to relieve you of your command .
but i &apos;m the coach , so --
i &apos;m the coach now .
glad you got here in time to see that .
it &apos;s not funny , claire .
cam . where are you ?
in the parking lot with binoculars .
what , when did --
when did you buy an army jacket ?
not him , to the left .
oh , hi .
so you let debbie take your whistle ?
well , yeah , i can &apos;t blame her . i &apos;m a terrible coach .
i mean , i &apos;m sorry i @-@ i pushed you away .
no , no , no . you hush up .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s sorry .
you know what ? i &apos;ve been trying to pretend like
the pressure hasn &apos;t gotten to me , but it has .
oh , my god . me too .
i , i always thought we were that couple
that could rise above tough times , you know ?
i just -- i don &apos;t want to feel like there &apos;s distance between us .
what ? sorry , you &apos;re -- say that again .
you &apos;re breaking up .
i didn &apos;t hear you .
what ? huh ?
what ? t @-@ there you are .
second half , girls .
oh , god . okay . intermission &apos;s over . i got to --
okay , listen up , bub . you go get your team back .
we need this . you &apos;re gonna get us a win today .
how ?
just go get your whistle back .
look at me .
we got this .
okay , so we &apos;re down by three , but - - - hi !
so , i got this from here , so --
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what i was born to do .
i am a coach , damn it .
god . i &apos;m so sorry .
that came off so much easier when you did it .
as our history with costume parties has taught us --
we shine brightest when we work as a team .
yeah .
okay , have the forwards form a triangle , spread the defense .
okay , forwards , form a triangle .
spread the defense .
by late in the half , we had tied the score .
proving once again , the best offense is a good defense .
that &apos;s like saying the best hat is a shoe .
okay , with 10 seconds left , lily was open on the wing .
now have her pass to lily .
pass to lily !
she passed to lily .
i can see .
what ? ! yes ! yes ! yes !
that was me . i did that .
that was him ! he did that .
it does feel different without her here .
yep .
pretty quiet without luke here , too .
did he say what time he &apos;s coming home ?
soon , i &apos;m sure . oh , he left you something .
&quot; thanks for letting me see that crazy house today .
feel like building one ourselves tomorrow ? &quot;
what ?
he went back for the duck eggs .
we found these eggs out in front of the house .
yeah , honey . i @-@ i @-@ i got it . i got it .
i know the two of you well enough .
i can connect the dots .
but you just really helped me out .
who are you --
again , mom ?
alex , i know you said not to call
unless it was very important , but this is .
i need to know everything you can tell me about baby ducks .
it stings !
this is so not sexy .
okay , so we all agree .
everybody gets a free pass once a year to miss a kid event .
ooh , i heard luke might be forming a boy band ,
so i want to get out in front of that .
great ! that means you &apos;ll be available
for my one @-@ man quick @-@ change version
of &quot; seven brides for seven brothers . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna change my vote .
yeah , put me down for missing that , too .
no , but you don &apos;t understand .
i @-@ i play all the brides and all the brothers .
make it three .
but you &apos;ll come , right , jay ?
