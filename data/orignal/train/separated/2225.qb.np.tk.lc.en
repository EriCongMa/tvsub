the author !
we know him , emma .
because of him , we were put on the path
to causing maleficent to lose her child .
she &apos;s alive .
in this world .
hello , sis .
zelena .
where &apos;s robin ? what have you done with him ?
one phone call from me ,
and your beloved dies at the hands of your sister .
what do you want from me ?
you are gonna write new happy endings .
you have made me a monster ,
but i won &apos;t let you do the same to emma .
heel .
that &apos;s far enough .
now be a good girl and come back home .
i won &apos;t .
you can &apos;t make me .
as a matter of fact , i can .
and now that your father &apos;s gone ,
we &apos;re going to make a few changes around the house , cruella .
this is where you &apos;ll be sleeping from now on .
so you &apos;re just going to drop me off here ?
like one of your dogs ?
this room must be your world now ,
until someday , you learn to do as i say .
we need to talk .
good thing i had my brakes serviced , darling .
i do hate getting blood on the car .
there &apos;s still time for that .
tell me about lily .
sorry . who ?
my daughter lily .
you told me she didn &apos;t survive the trip to this world .
you lied .
perhaps i did . um , but there &apos;s an explanation , of course .
you see , um ...
i &apos;m a really terrible person ,
and i left her in the woods to die .
you did what ?
oh , don &apos;t be so flabbergasted .
you know i &apos;m not mother material .
ursula and i took that dragon egg she was in .
oh , the magic helped us stay young , you know .
wonderful thing .
but the little brat -- - my daughter .
yes . well ...
you should know
your death is going to last for days .
oh , i was so hoping you &apos;d do that .
people always underestimate a girl in diamonds and furs ,
don &apos;t they ?
i mean , no one guessed what i was really after .
not gold . certainly not you .
but now that the author is here ,
today is the day that i get mine .
now be a good girl , lie down , and take a nap .
you have to remember something else about the author ,
some way to find him . now think .
we told you everything we know .
are we sure about that ?
because secrets just keep coming out .
okay . you &apos;re clearly still upset .
yes , i am still upset .
you were the ones who taught me there is always a right way .
a heroic way .
and what you did to maleficent &apos;s child ...
it was our only option
to make sure you grew up ... good .
i &apos;m sorry , but if it were me , no matter what ,
i would not harm a defenseless person .
and that right there --
that goodness is exactly why we did what we did .
it was worth it .
regina , where have you been ?
in the middle of a very bad day .
i &apos;ll tell you the whole story later ,
after i rescue robin hood .
robin hood ? what the hell are you talking about ?
i called that number you gave me ,
but marian answered the phone , and i discovered ...
she &apos;s not really marian at all .
so who is she ?
zelena .
the wicked witch ?
i don &apos;t know how it &apos;s possible , but my sister
has been masquerading as her this entire time .
and she &apos;s in league with gold .
robin &apos;s in danger , so i &apos;m going to new york to find him
and stop her .
and what about gold ?
if they &apos;re working together ,
he &apos;s not just gonna let you waltz off and spoil his plans .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about gold .
i know exactly how to handle him .
regina , i didn &apos;t , uh , didn &apos;t hear you come in .
your ex @-@ husband has done quite a number on me , belle .
i &apos;m , uh ... sorry to hear that .
and now he wants me to work with him .
uh , well , i &apos;m sure that would be a mistake .
i know it is .
how can i help ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
well , this is certainly homey .
antlers are a nice touch .
makes me feel like hemingway .
or maybe thoreau .
name &apos;s isaac , by the way .
do you always talk this much ?
only when i &apos;m nervous .
and you still have my quill .
yeah . well , for now , let &apos;s call it ...
my quill .
you know , it &apos;s worthless without its ink .
oh , i &apos;m aware ,
and i plan to obtain some very soon .
yeah . and just how are you gonna do that ?
simple .
now you &apos;re here ,
i &apos;m gonna turn the savior dark .
what will that accomplish ?
once her heart has been blackened ,
everything i need shall fall into place .
you &apos;ll see soon enough ,
when my associates return .
your associates seem to have a taste for fur .
and perfume .
can &apos;t wait to meet them .
surely you must know them from your stories .
know of them , sure ,
but an author rarely gets -- - be quiet .
don &apos;t say another word .
something &apos;s just come up .
you stay here till i return .
until you return ? but who &apos;s gonna ...
protect me ?
rumplestiltskin .
rumple -- - hello , belle .
hello .
this is a curious place to meet .
do you , uh , do you remember what you told me here
the night of our vows ?
how i chased all the darkness out of you ?
belle , look , i &apos;m sorry for everything .
no .
no apologies today .
for once in my life , i just want the truth .
why are you here , rumple ?
are you -- are you trying to win me back ?
it &apos;s a bit more complicated than that .
rumple .
it seems that centuries of dark deeds
do take their toll .
and all that &apos;s left of it ...
is this .
and pretty soon ,
that will be gone , too .
will you die ?
in a manner of speaking , yes .
i will lose any ability to love .
and that goodness that you once saw inside of me ...
well , that &apos;ll be gone forever .
there &apos;s only one man who can reverse this process ,
and that &apos;s the author .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here in storybrooke .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , of course .
but i ...
i @-@ i do understand .
you do ?
sometimes i worry ...
i worry i threw out the chipped teacup too soon .
you know what the problem is , though ?
will is just such a better kisser than you are .
w @-@ what ?
you &apos;re pathetic .
watching you come groveling back to me ,
it &apos;s like a dog begging for scraps .
why are you saying that ?
this isn &apos;t like you , belle .
but it is so like me .
regina .
now forget all this and run along home .
you have no idea
just how much i &apos;m gonna make you suffer for this .
oh , you &apos;re not gonna do a thing ,
unless you wanna see what happens
when i take this heart and squeeze .
come on .
we both know you don &apos;t have it in you .
don &apos;t i ?
all right , all right .
i believe you .
good .
so i &apos;m headed to new york now .
and if you breathe one word of this to zelena ,
you won &apos;t be the only one who loses a heart .
don &apos;t bother studying the greats , darling .
you &apos;ll never be one of them .
hello , isaac .
never thought you &apos;d see me again , did you ?
i was certainly hoping not to .
then why don &apos;t you make this easy
and give me back what you took ?
can &apos;t do it . sorry .
with one whistle ,
i can send a hundred snarling dogs after you .
you could ,
but you and i both know that even with all your magic ,
you don &apos;t have enough power to hurt me .
i do hate it when you &apos;re right , darling .
though i do like this new shade of confidence .
it &apos;s so ... masculine .
are you sure you can &apos;t help a girl out ?
for old time &apos;s sake ?
not a chance .
well , then you will pay for what you did
when you made me what i am .
you know , idle threats don &apos;t make for good drama .
but i do see one interesting story developing here .
really ? and what &apos;s that ?
rumplestiltskin .
has no idea that we know each other .
which means that ...
you lied to him .
so from one old friend to another ,
you should probably be gone before he gets back .
oh , you always did know how to infuriate a girl , didn &apos;t you ?
well , enjoy the upper hand
while it &apos;s still on your wrist ,
because i think you &apos;ll find ...
there &apos;s more than one way to skin an author .
and now a brand @-@ new song
straight from london &apos;s legendary murray &apos;s club ,
the toast of beak street .
cruella !
where did you get this ?
plug that back in . you simply have to hear this song .
you stole it , didn &apos;t you ? last time i let you out ?
well , that &apos;s because i &apos;m bored out of my mind !
i @-@ i &apos;ve read every book in here a hundred times .
and i wouldn &apos;t have to steal
if you &apos;d just let me leave this house just once .
out of the question .
stay here .
and be quiet .
can i help you ?
i certainly hope so . i &apos;m a newspaper writer .
i travel all over , collecting interesting personal stories .
none of those here , i &apos;m afraid . good night .
don &apos;t be modest .
i heard you &apos;re the best dog trainer in london .
you &apos;ve been hired by princes and kings .
all i &apos;m asking for is two minutes .
so tell me about this talent you have .
i &apos;ve heard the way you control your dogs ,
it &apos;s almost like magic .
no magic , i &apos;m afraid .
just hard work and routine .
well , that &apos;s dull .
to be honest ,
i &apos;m looking for stories with a bit more pizzazz .
a great story always needs just a sprinkle of magic ,
you know ?
something unexpected .
quite the portraits you &apos;ve got there .
relatives ?
husbands . i think it &apos;s time to go .
three husbands ?
now that &apos;s out of ordinary . tell me more .
are you a widow or a divorc茅e ?
you &apos;ve never been married , have you ?
give that back . and , no .
of course you haven &apos;t . if you &apos;d been married ,
you wouldn &apos;t ask those questions so callously .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? can i have it ...
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;ve never even been in love .
that is not your business .
what ...
maybe you should write your own story for once ,
instead of leeching off other people &apos;s pain .
nice to meet you , too , lady .
i heard the whole thing .
are you really after a great story ?
yes . who are you ?
i &apos;m a girl with a great story .
all right . i &apos;m all ears .
i &apos;m sorry . if you want to hear it ,
you &apos;re gonna have to get me out of here first .
hey , pongo .
what are you doing here ?
you shouldn &apos;t be out here by yourself .
pongo !
pongo ! pongo !
okay .
come here , boy .
what &apos;s wrong ? calm down .
don &apos;t blame the dog , darling . he &apos;s simply following orders ,
and i told him to fetch .
what do you want ?
i want you to be a good boy and get in the car .
this is amazing . how did you do that ?
i have my methods .
and this key ?
i mean , my mother never lets it out of her sight .
do you wanna keep asking questions
or do you wanna get out of here ?
i know a nice quiet spot we can talk .
well , i &apos;d prefer somewhere loud .
loud ? why ?
i live in an attic ,
and my mother never allows me visitors or music or fun .
i mean , she even ripped my favorite trumpet flowers
out of the garden because she doesn &apos;t like the smell .
all right , i get the picture .
wherever you wanna go ,
i can take you .
that is your car ?
all four wheels .
this is just how i always imagined it .
the music and the dances and ... gin .
you &apos;ll get used to the taste .
now from what i &apos;ve seen so far ,
yours has all the makings of a classic cinderella story .
so tell me , why did she lock you up ?
self @-@ preservation .
mummy dear is afraid if i get out ,
i &apos;ll tell everyone her dirty little secret .
what secret ?
everyone believes that my father died of a heart attack ,
but i know the truth -- mother poisoned him .
how do you know for sure ?
any doubts i had were put to rest
when husbands two and three were found belly @-@ up .
a cinderella tale with a black widow twist .
now this is a great story .
oh , i love this song !
come on .
put your silly pen down and come and dance with me .
oh , no , no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i write stories .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t dance in them .
no .
come on .
your mother might be a murderess ,
but she &apos;s right about one thing .
i spend too much time recording life
and not enough time living it .
well , then tonight ,
let &apos;s live !
you sure going to new york is a good idea ?
you don &apos;t know what zelena has planned .
what if you &apos;re walking into a trap ?
robin &apos;s in trouble . i have no choice .
you don &apos;t have to go alone .
don &apos;t worry about me .
you have your hands full with the author .
i can handle one wicked sister .
things are different in new york .
without your magic , y ...
listen .
if you won &apos;t take me with you , i want you to take this .
i hope you don &apos;t have to use it , but ...
i want you to stay safe .
thank you .
so you &apos;re not ... angry with me
for keeping your parents &apos; secret ?
it &apos;s between me and them . you were just trying to help .
it &apos;s henry .
video message ?
must be a thing now . i got one , too .
mom , mom , cruella has me .
if you ever wanna see me again ,
you have to do what she says .
hello , darlings !
as you can see , i have your dreadful son .
if you prefer him to remain in tact ,
you &apos;ll do exactly as i say ...
kill the author .
then , ah , bring me his broken little body ,
or ...
your boy will meet a very unhappy ending .
finally .
the joy of getting lost in a good book just isn &apos;t the same .
not after it happens to you literally .
stop talking .
we haven &apos;t much time ,
now that you and cruella have been reunited at last .
cruella ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t even -- - enough .
you both lied to me about your past ,
and now those lies are coming to the surface .
i &apos;m sorry .
please don &apos;t hurt me . i @-@ i didn &apos;t think it was ...
relevant .
oh , it &apos;s not only relevant ,
it is essential to my plans .
cruella is so desperate to see you dead ,
she just kidnapped the savior &apos;s son .
how do you know that ?
well , you have your tools .
i have mine .
i watched as cruella gave the savior
a rather morbid choice --
either you die ...
or her son dies .
now hang on .
you said you need me to get the savior to go dark .
this is how you plan to do it ? by having her kill me ? !
relax .
if you died , uh ,
the mantle of &quot; the author &quot; simply passes on ,
perhaps to someone less willing to help me .
no , no . i need you alive .
then why work with cruella , if she wants me dead ?
a person obsessed with vengeance
is easy to manipulate .
she thought i believed her happy ending
was reconciling with her mother .
but i knew she was after something else --
your death .
now i wanna know why .
i wanna precisely what you wrote about her ,
the exact words .
you wanna know ?
here .
read it for yourself .
i &apos;m better on the page , anyway .
i wish , i wish this would never end .
well , thank you .
this was a night i shan &apos;t forget .
i @-@ i @-@ i can make it even more memorable .
there &apos;s something i wanna show you .
a pen ?
it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s the most important thing i have . it &apos;s ...
special .
see , there &apos;s something about me i haven &apos;t told you .
well , whatever it is , don &apos;t worry .
i mean , i &apos;ve told you all my secrets .
you can tell me anything .
okay .
the truth is , i don &apos;t go across the country
collecting stories for the paper .
the places i go ...
they &apos;re a lot farther apart .
i @-@ i travel across realms .
realms of storytelling .
what ?
this place right here is one of them .
it -- it exists out of time .
tell me , what year is it ?
who bothers with such trivial things ?
exactly . we &apos;re not in a time .
we &apos;re in a realm of story .
there are many -- some beautiful ,
some horrific , and some just plain magical .
i think you &apos;ve had too much gin .
i know how it sounds ,
but that &apos;s not even the craziest part .
this pen and ink are enchanted with magic .
they &apos;re so powerful , i can do more than just write people &apos;s stories .
i can change them .
are you really serious ?
i can prove it .
look .
that &apos;s impossible .
that &apos;s some kind of trick .
is it ?
how about a pair of diamond earrings to match ?
that pen and ink really are magic .
careful . they have to be used together .
there &apos;s no telling what would happen if that ink spilled .
and you can write anything ?
yes .
don &apos;t you see ?
i can use it to whisk us away
to someplace where your mother
and her dogs can never find us .
we can be together .
if only it were that simple .
it can be .
what if i gave you magic ,
so no matter where you were , you &apos;d be safe ?
you &apos;d do that for me ?
watch me .
i think i ...
i think i can feel it working .
let &apos;s leave now .
we can get in my car and just drive .
we won &apos;t stop until we &apos;re far , far away .
no . i have to face my mother first .
she needs to know that she no longer has power over me .
i can take you .
no . i ...
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s something i have to do alone .
and because of you , i can .
meet you at the hotel ?
and promise me you won &apos;t run off with any other lucky girl .
i promise .
here .
take my car to be sure .
it &apos;s yours now .
until then .
i recognize that trailhead marker .
cruella is holding henry
a couple of miles south of the toll bridge .
so what now ?
time to get our hands dirty
and do whatever it takes to get him back .
you &apos;re not actually considering cruella &apos;s demand
to kill the author ?
of course not .
even if we could find him ,
it wouldn &apos;t be half the fun of killing cruella .
let &apos;s see how she likes being made into outerwear .
regina !
what ?
it &apos;s emma &apos;s heart we &apos;re trying to protect , not mine .
if we go in guns blazing , we risk hurting henry .
we have to find another way .
i &apos;ve headed many rescue missions .
it would be helpful to know the terrain more .
and where the author is . if he &apos;s enemies with cruella ,
maybe he knows the best way to defeat her .
oh , we may be able to help with that .
we went back to the convent
and found a flask that we gave him .
he dropped it when he escaped .
a locator spell might work on it .
sounds like a perfect job for you two .
i &apos;ll take regina and hook , and we &apos;ll scope out
the area where cruella &apos;s holed up with henry .
emma , i know you &apos;re still angry ,
but avoiding us is not going to help .
i &apos;m not avoiding you .
with henry &apos;s life on the line ,
i need to be around people i trust ,
and right now , that &apos;s not you .
you &apos;re acting like a petulant child .
your parents did a bad thing .
they apologized . now get over it .
forgive me if i don &apos;t take advice from the woman
who held a grudge for half her life
because a 10 @-@ year @-@ old spilled a secret .
swan , if you won &apos;t listen to regina ,
perhaps you &apos;ll listen to me .
you were able to forgive both of us
all because you found it in your heart to see past it .
the difference is that you never held yourself
as some paragon of virtue .
neither of you did .
you were honest about who you were .
my parents weren &apos;t . they said they were heroes .
even heroes make mistakes , love .
you know , not long ago , your mother gave me some advice .
she said
i needed to believe i could still earn forgiveness ,
that i had a chance at grace .
i didn &apos;t realize it then ,
but she was talking about herself .
emma , she &apos;s been trying to make up
for what she did for a long time .
if you two understand them so well , you forgive them .
i ... can &apos;t .
more important things to worry about right now ,
like saving henry .
blasted birds .
i &apos;ll show you what angry looks like .
pongo , sic !
cruella !
you .
where is she ? where is my daughter ?
i don &apos;t have to tell you anything .
the dogs can smell her on you .
where &apos;s she gone ? why were you with her ? !
i was following your advice ,
living life instead of just writing about it .
and now , thanks to cruella ,
i won &apos;t ever be going back .
you foolish boy .
stay .
you should &apos;ve gotten far away from her when you had the chance .
why ?
so your secret would remain buried ?
yes , cruella told me the truth
about her father and the others ,
that you murdered them .
she really did a number on you , didn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d think a newspaper man would know a tall tale
when he heard one ,
because i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
don &apos;t you understand ? it was cruella .
you expect me to believe that that angel i danced with tonight
is a killer ?
i didn &apos;t want to believe it either .
she was always a troubled little girl .
her father and i had hopes she &apos;d grow out of it .
until one night , he was having his tea in the parlor
when i heard a thump .
i raced in to find him dead on the floor
from a heart attack .
cruella , the poor dear , was there ,
paralyzed with shock .
after the doctor left , my first thoughts went to her ,
what effect seeing her father die
would have on an already disturbed mind .
so i went up to try and comfort her .
i expected to find her crying , but she wasn &apos;t .
instead , i @-@ i saw a hint of a smile on her face .
i thought i was imagining things ,
but then i saw the trumpet flowers on the bedside table .
her favorite flowers .
the ones you ripped out because you hated the smell .
i ripped them out because they were poisonous .
she poisoned him .
you &apos;re lying .
if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
you would &apos;ve gone to the authorities .
how could i ?
she was my daughter , and i blamed myself .
i thought if i kept her close that i could somehow fix her .
but there &apos;s no fixing her .
she poisoned the next two husbands as well .
get out of here ...
before i call the police .
you don &apos;t have to believe me .
just stay away from cruella .
she takes the things you care about and she destroys them .
it &apos;s just a bucket of fiction , that &apos;s all .
cruella ?
hello , mother . i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
dogs !
oh , that &apos;s not going to work anymore .
what did you do to them ?
i simply taught them a new command --
kill .
help me ! please !
help me ! help !
it &apos;s henry . quick , it &apos;s coming from over there .
no , it &apos;s this way .
has cannon fire damaged your hearing ?
it clearly came from over there .
no ! no ! help me , please !
split up . go !
somebody !
henry ? !
help me ! please !
no .
help me , please !
henry ? !
somebody ! help me !
magic .
help me !
please , somebody --
pongo ...
who says you can &apos;t teach an old dog new tricks ?
you shouldn &apos;t have run .
henry !
mom !
let him go !
i &apos;m afraid not .
come any closer , and he dies .
cruella ?
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
where &apos;s your mother ?
cruella !
well , thanks to you , she &apos;s dead , darling .
oh , you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face
when her beloved dogs turned on her .
it &apos;s a memory i shall truly cherish .
no .
no .
oh , you needn &apos;t fear the dogs anymore .
they &apos;re with mother now .
how could you do this ?
i thought you cared about me .
well , that was the idea , darling .
you were ... what is the phrase ?
a means to an end .
why ?
that &apos;s the question on everybody &apos;s mind , isn &apos;t it ?
i wish i had an answer .
some people struggle not to be drawn into the darkness .
ever since i was a little girl , i &apos;ve said ,
&quot; why not splash in and ... &quot; &quot; and have fun ? &quot;
drop that , you horrid little scribbler !
you can &apos;t get it done in real life ,
so you scratch it out like a rat scrabbling in filth !
why can &apos;t i pull the trigger ? what did you do ? !
i learned a lesson from you .
take what a person loves ... and destroy it .
you fool .
you damned insane fool !
i &apos;m not done !
i &apos;m not done at all !
don &apos;t come any closer !
stay back !
we &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
we just want some information .
i want some guarantees ,
because if i tell you everything ,
you just might kill the messenger .
you &apos;re safe . trust us .
trust you ?
i &apos;ve seen what you &apos;ll do to protect your daughter .
you said you wouldn &apos;t h--
what have you done with emma ?
nothing .
i was just trying to protect the world from cruella .
i had no idea that gold would use her like this .
even i couldn &apos;t see the end to the story .
what are you talking about ?
how does the story end ?
with the savior ...
turning dark .
what is that ?
something i wrote .
the truth .
&quot; cruella de vil can no longer
take away the life of another . &quot;
do you see now ?
henry &apos;s in no danger .
cruella can &apos;t kill anyone .
she &apos;s defenseless .
emma doesn &apos;t know ,
which means gold wants her to ...
we have to stop this .
one small dead author . that &apos;s all i asked .
simple revenge , and you failed utterly .
put the gun down , cruella .
mom .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , henry .
i &apos;ll do it , savior .
believe me , i will .
cruella .
put your hands down , savior .
we both know you &apos;re bluffing .
that &apos;s my son .
and you &apos;re a hero ,
and heroes don &apos;t kill .
henry ?
mom .
no , no .
emma ?
