the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
how long has it been since you had a drop of human blood ?
since the night i threatened to drive elena
off the wickery bridge .
look at the images on the wall behind elena .
a white oak tree
300 years after we fled back to the old world .
that tree could kill us .
brian walters , the medical examiner .
he &apos;s not a vampire .
this was a murder .
why don &apos;t you just ask ric
if his dirty little doctor
had access to the weapons .
you think i killed my ex @-@ boyfriend ?
dad .
you weren &apos;t supposed to see that .
will you get home all right , mr. salvatore ?
i could send for one of the police vehicles .
a little winter chill never hurt anyone , sheriff forbes .
i &apos;m less concerned about the cold front ,
more for your safety .
one councilman &apos;s murder
doesn &apos;t make an epidemic , gerald .
good night .
night .
the mystery &apos;s not gonna get solved
any faster with you yelling at me , carol .
we have 2 council murders
and an attempted murder on our hands .
if you have a suspect ,
it is your duty to keep me in the loop .
no , it &apos;s my duty to make sure
i don &apos;t accuse an innocent person of being a serial killer .
just tell me who it is , liz .
i didn &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re arresting him ?
for what this nut job dr. fell says ?
no , i &apos;m detaining him .
the cell is for his own good . you were shot .
dr. fell used vampire blood to heal you .
dr. fell is the one who shot me .
because you came at her with a knife .
yeah , with a knife i had found hidden in her things .
are we gonna ignore the part
where he &apos;s one of the killer &apos;s victims ?
i mean , the guy was practically stabbed to death .
well , dr. fell suggested his wounds
could have been self @-@ inflicted .
my god , you think i stabbed myself ?
look , i think i don &apos;t know what to think .
i &apos;ve got nothing
except murder weapons from your stash
and a respected member of a founding family
pointing a very long finger .
she is setting me up .
i &apos;m being framed here .
well , that may be so ,
but i don &apos;t have any proof of that .
well , then we &apos;ll find some .
no , just stay out of this , damon .
you getting involved is only gonna make matters worse .
listen , liz-
don &apos;t make me put you in that cell with him .
what are we running , a marathon ?
if you can &apos;t keep up ...
elena , you can &apos;t outrun your problems .
although it looks like you &apos;re gonna try .
i talked to bonnie !
what did she say ?
they &apos;re at her mom &apos;s house .
abby &apos;s gonna complete the transition .
she decided to become a vampire ?
yeah .
caroline &apos;s gonna help her through it ,
teach her control and stuff .
did bonnie say ...
is there anything i can do ?
she knows it &apos;s not your fault , elena .
she &apos;s just ...
upset .
damon turned her mom into a vampire to save my life .
it &apos;s absolutely my fault .
you &apos;re gonna make me run more , aren &apos;t you ?
who is it ?
sheriff forbes . everything ok ?
he what ?
were you just with--
ric &apos;s fine .
sheriff wants me to stay out of it .
but you &apos;re not going to ,
are you ?
seems just as good a plan as any .
your friend &apos;s in jail for murder .
you have to do something .
well , i guess i could rip out
dr. false accusation &apos;s throat or maybe her tongue .
you know , i could chew it up in little , tiny pieces
and feed it to the squirrels .
stop it , damon .
guess me staying out of it
suddenly sounds like a good idea , doesn &apos;t it ?
i saved your life last night .
you &apos;re welcome .
you know , you could show a little compassion about bonnie .
i know . you &apos;re right .
her and her mom must be really hurting right now .
should i send lasagna ?
ok , now you &apos;re just being mean .
i &apos;m mean . you hate me .
the earth is back on its axis .
you know what ? if you keep pushing people away ,
you &apos;re gonna end up alone .
&quot; dear diary ,
the chipmunk asked me my name today .
i told him it was joe .
that lie will haunt me forever . &quot;
what do you want ?
i was hoping we could hang .
you know , a little brother bonding .
i mean , i know we don &apos;t actually
&quot; hang out . &quot;
we team up .
we join forces ,
activate our wonder twin powers .
what are you doing ?
digging up clues .
most of the originals are gone ,
but we have a whodunit in town .
hey , do you remember when we came back for zachariah &apos;s funeral ?
vaguely . why ?
&apos;cause if memory serves ,
he wasn &apos;t the first founders council member killed that year
or even that month .
your point being ?
i &apos;m trying to remember what year it was .
1912 .
so much for vaguely .
1912 .
or as i like to call it ,
last time mystic falls had a serial killer on its hands .
it feels so strange to be home again after so long away .
i thought i would never return ,
certainly not for a funeral .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss , mr. salvatore .
i &apos;m told you &apos;re a distant cousin of zachariah .
his nephew , actually .
miss ...
lockwood .
mariana lockwood .
and this is my friend samantha gilbert .
as in jonathan gilbert .
my late grandfather .
did you know him ?
crossed paths .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t n &apos;an to be--
inappropriate .
but no one seems to be willing
to discuss the details of zachariah &apos;s death .
he was murdered ,
and he wasn &apos;t the first .
samantha , don &apos;t be a gossip .
why not ? he should know .
he &apos;s a founding family like us .
be careful , mr. salvatore .
it &apos;s not a good time to be a founder in this town .
have you been eating the relatives again ?
damon .
it &apos;s bee a long time , brother .
it &apos;s been almost 50 years .
surprised you came .
and miss the funeral of--
what do you call him ?
uncle zachariah ?
i see you &apos;re still mad at me .
why would i be mad at you , stefan ?
you made me become a vampire ,
and now i walk the world alone drinking other people &apos;s blood .
any chance you took it all out on our nephew zachariah ?
if i &apos;m not mistaken ,
you were the one who killed our family members .
may our father rest in peace .
i &apos;m not like that anymore , damon .
well , congratulations , stefan .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;d like to live out my eternal existence
as far away from you as possible .
damon , wait .
let &apos;s grab a drink ,
catch up .
i &apos;ve missed you , brother .
sure .
why not ?
what do you say , brother ?
you wanna go get drunk ?
ah . i get it .
i get it .
you &apos;re bored .
your best friend &apos;s in jail ,
and you don &apos;t have anything better to do with yourself .
well , there &apos;s that .
and ...
i was hoping you could help me solve a murder .
thank you for meeting with me , mayor .
i figured as head of the preservation society ,
you &apos;d be a good person to ask
about the oldest trees in this community .
a long line of lockwood women used to keep those records
back before any of them had actual jobs .
i &apos;ve been to the founders archive ,
but i can &apos;t seem to find any record of the tree i &apos;m looking for .
it probably got cut down .
big odl trees built half this town in the 1900s .
ho . she @-@ devil , 9 o &apos;clock .
do you happen to know who kept
the milling ledgers during that period ?
back then , all the logging mills were owned by the salvatores .
so what does the medical examiner ,
bill forbes , and alaric saltzman have in common ?
come on . knock it off .
you know , quitting blood cold turkey after a ripper binge ,
probably not the best approach .
every time you play that all @-@ or @-@ nothing game ,
you eventually leave a trail of bodies ,
so i &apos;m thinking now &apos;s a good time
to pay our old friend moderation a visit .
they were all on the founders council , damon .
that &apos;s what they have in common .
but why them , huh ?
brian walters and alaric weren &apos;t from founding families .
i mean , hey ,
if you gotta slaughter council members , go a @-@ list .
at least in 1912 , they killed a salvatore .
which salvatore would that be ?
you &apos;ll have to agree , sheriff ,
there &apos;s no motive here .
look , both the medical examiner
and my ex @-@ husband got into altercations
with meredith fell before their deaths .
now , she said you were a witness to her fight with brian walters .
so what are you saying , that i was defending her honor ?
i barely knew her then .
she said she also told you bill threatened
to report her to the medical board for giving him vampire blood .
no , she didn &apos;t .
a 2 a.m. call on the night he was killed ?
i pulled your records .
you spoke with her for over an hour .
ok . i , uh ...
yes , i ...
i remember calling her , but i--
i was drinking , and i--
i don &apos;t remember the conversation .
well , do you have an alibi for the night brian walters was killed ?
i was there the night of the bridge fundraiser , ok ,
until midnight . you saw me there .
time of death was between 1 : 00 and 3 a.m.
well , then , i--
i must have been home sleeping , i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;m sure of it .
so zachariah salvatore was your nephew ?
well , our father knocked up one of the maids during the civil war .
she had a son .
but as far as everyone else knew , stefan and i were dead .
family name had to go somewhere .
and , uh , your family owned the logging mills back then .
you &apos;re full of a lot of questions .
i &apos;m just researching the town history .
i grew up here , after all .
you know , you don &apos;t have to disguise your true motives . blondie bex .
if you want more sex , just ask for it .
not enough liquor in the world .
on , come on . it was too good for you to be this hostile .
you &apos;ll have to excuse my little brother .
he &apos;s jonesing for some o @-@ positive .
i &apos;m not jonesing .
so they ever catch the killer ?
nope .
wrote it all off on vampires .
maybe it was a vampire .
yeah .
yeah , maybe it was a vampire , damon .
don &apos;t think for a second you didn &apos;t cross my mind , too , brother .
but these murders weren &apos;t your style , were they ?
plus there were no other vampires circulating then .
well , there was one other vampire .
remember sage ?
oh , right .
sage .
speaking of great sex .
maybe you &apos;ve had enough .
ladies and gentlemen ...
hit a man when he &apos;s down .
sell your horse . come one and all
to see the san francisco world fair middleweight champion ...
... greatest foe down .
get ready , ladies and gentlemen , for an evening--
who &apos;s next ?
$ 100 to any man who can beat me .
i can teach you how to survive without human blood , you know .
you do not get to lecture me on how to live my life ,
not anymore .
what &apos;s your name ?
not interested .
well , mr. not interested ,
you seem to me like a gambling man .
i &apos;m afraid you have me all wrong .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
i knew a sage once .
trashy little thing .
you really think it was sage
who was killing all those founders back then ?
town questioned every grown man in mystic falls .
probably never occurred to them that a woman could have done it .
i &apos;m due in surgery .
whatever case you &apos;re gonna make against alaric ,
make it quick .
i don &apos;t have to make a case .
he didn &apos;t do anything .
how do you know ?
sure you live with him , he takes care of you ,
but do you really know anything about him ?
i know enough .
let me tell you what i know .
he was arrested for fighting 4 times before the age of 21 .
when he was at duke , his future wife isobel
filed a restraining order against him twice .
although then she married him ,
so i guess that says more about her .
ok , you &apos;re making all of this up .
am i ?
how would you know ?
you took pity on a borderline alcoholic vampire hunter ,
and you never even thought to look any deeper .
how could you do this to him ?
he didn &apos;t kill anyone , and you know it .
you date vampires , elena .
it shouldn &apos;t come as a shock
to learn that your guardian is a murderer .
so , uh , tell me more about your old relatives .
i heard they tore down half the woods to make this town .
easy there , lushy pants .
it &apos;s been a hoot and a half , but it &apos;s boys night ,
and you weren &apos;t invited .
wow . nice job .
i &apos;ll add breaking and entering to the list of life favors you owe me .
ok , look , i don &apos;t know how much longer
meredith &apos;s gonna be in surgery ,
so let &apos;s see what we can find .
don &apos;t you think the police already combed through this place ?
she handed over everything she had .
yeah , i &apos;m looking for the evidence that she didn &apos;t hand over .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s her we should be investigating ?
i know him , matt .
he &apos;s innocent .
and i know that meredith &apos;s a fell ,
founding family ,
which means ...
skeleton in the closet ...
just like a true founder .
brian walters , bill forbes .
alaric saltzman .
so ...
let &apos;s just say sage was killing everyone in 1912 .
who the hell is doing it now ?
it &apos;s not that psycho , dr. fell .
she &apos;s a woman .
there &apos;s no way she could stab 3 grown men .
that &apos;s a bit sexist .
a woman could easily kill a man
with the right motivation .
you just , uh , don &apos;t give up , do you ?
why are you so grumpy ?
he &apos;s on a master cleanse ,
trying to be a better man and all .
yeah , you were a lot more fun in the twenties .
you &apos;ll rile him up .
he &apos;s testy when he &apos;s being self @-@ righteous .
i &apos;m not being self @-@ righteous , damon .
i &apos;m just not interested
in slaughtering innocent human beings anymore .
oh , ok . fair enough .
my mistake .
you used to be self @-@ righteous .
&quot; dear diary , damon has lost his way .
though i have pulled my own life together ,
he continues to waste his . &quot;
&quot; his bitterness consumes him .
he is nothing but blackness and bile . &quot;
oof . judgey .
oh , this is fun .
you know , if i &apos;m being honest .
you don &apos;t seem like much fun either , damon .
i wasn &apos;t . woman i was in love with was stuck in a tomb .
she wasn &apos;t getting out for 100 years .
i wasn &apos;t having any fun at all .
how sad .
you &apos;re doing it all wrong .
bad vampire .
i was hungry .
now i &apos;m not hungry .
my quality of form is ...
purely subjective .
a woman isn &apos;t just for food .
she &apos;s for pleasure .
i do not need a woman for pleasure .
i am spoken for .
we are all spoken for
in some way .
but what is being a vampire
if not relishing in the pleasure of it ?
come along . let me show you .
hit him !
look at the women .
they &apos;re beautiful , aren &apos;t they ?
not them . they &apos;re too hungry for attention .
you want the ones who button themselves up .
watch them . they can &apos;t tear their eyes away .
those are the women who secretly crave seduction .
they &apos;ll put up a good fight ,
but the game is in winning them over ,
making them beg for it .
what if they don &apos;t ?
you &apos;re a vampire .
you take it .
her .
that sounded like sage , all right .
how did you know her ?
she was obsessed with my brother finn over 900 years ago .
what ? creepy , suicidal guy ?
you &apos;re doing it again .
all right , you know what ?
i need to , uh ...
i got to get out of here .
sure .
first admit you &apos;re jonesing .
damon , i &apos;m not gonna--
admit it .
ok , fine . i &apos;m freaking out .
i &apos;m ready to eat the entire wait staff .
why do you need to hear me say it ?
because i &apos;m feeling a little self @-@ righteous , too .
she &apos;s got everything on him--
medical records ,
old court documents .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s an old gilbert journal .
why is one of your old family journals in her closet ?
didn &apos;t you say the medical examiner &apos;s
time of death was between 1 and 3 a.m. ?
yeah . why ?
because the county coroner &apos;s office says that &apos;s wrong .
oh , my god .
i think--
what were you thinking ?
i know that we had no right .
no right ? you broke the law .
but we found something that clears alaric .
it gives him an alibi in the brian walters murder .
you mean this ?
what is that ?
a letter from the county coroner &apos;s office
correcting the error in the time of death of brian walters .
meredith fell received it today .
she brought it to me several hours ago ,
full of apologies for accusing an innocent man .
why would she have a copy hidden in her closet ?
i can &apos;t ask those questions , matt ,
because of the very fact that you broke into her home to find it .
do you know how much i &apos;m already protecting both of you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
just get out of my office and go home ,
please .
alaric &apos;ll be released as soon as the letter is authenticated .
go .
so he doesn &apos;t want to drink human blood ?
ah , he has an eternally guilty conscience .
funny . when i knew him in the twenties ,
he didn &apos;t have any conscience at all .
it &apos;s one of the things i liked most about him .
he can &apos;t possibly think he can survive without feeding .
oh , on the contrary .
he &apos;s determined to live his life pursuing one extreme or the other .
he &apos;s a stubborn one , my brother .
think i &apos;m gonna need some help with this one .
what can i do ?
hello .
this may seem very forward ,
but you &apos;re just so pretty .
thank you .
and please don &apos;t scream .
you &apos;re about to have a very , very bad night .
stop . stop it .
sorry , brother .
it &apos;s dinnertime .
have a bite .
what are you doing ?
tough love , stefan .
you &apos;re not gonna survive this cold @-@ turkey thing . you never do .
it &apos;s time to get that monkey off your back .
no .
feed ...
or i &apos;ll let rebekah have her way with her .
you know she &apos;ll kill her .
oh , i will .
then her blood &apos;ll be on your hands .
or you can just have a little drink ,
save her life . come on , stefan .
you were the one that said you didn &apos;t want
any more innocent life slaughtered .
save her .
go on . have a bite .
i snatched . you eat . i erase .
hell , i &apos;ll even heal her for you when it &apos;s over .
why are you doing this ?
you know what blood does to me .
cause you let it control you .
you always have .
i &apos;m just here to help you learn how to fight it .
this is rubbish .
that &apos;s it , stefan .
i got it from here . go ahead
night &apos;s just getting started .
scram . no one likes a lurker .
you &apos;re a real ass , you know .
so i &apos;m told .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
come on . you &apos;re gonna bleed her dry .
you &apos;re gonna drain her . come on .
i said that &apos;s enough .
hey , you wanna fight hunger ,
or you wanna fight me ?
i got you .
that &apos;s a good girl .
what are you doing ?
stefan .
elena .
what are you two doing ?
relax , elena .
just a little experiment .
there &apos;s no need to make this more dramatic than it needs to be .
elena , let &apos;s just go .
elena !
so ...
that &apos;s gonna take a little time .
stefan . wait . hey .
stefan , wait .
just say it .
i just don &apos;t get it , your thing with them .
i know it doesn &apos;t make sense .
but at the beginning ,
after my parents died ,
there was something about being with stefan ,
that just ...
felt safe .
safe ?
elena , he &apos;s a vampire .
i know , believe me .
just saying it out loud sounds crazy , but ...
it &apos;s like i knew that he would never stop loving me ,
like he would never ...
what ?
die .
like he would never die .
like your parents did .
and damon ?
damon just sort of snuck up on me .
he got under my skin ,
and no matter what i do , i just--
i can &apos;t shake him .
once you fall in love with someone ,
i don &apos;t know if--
i don &apos;t know if you can ever shake &apos; em .
i &apos;m sorry .
is--is this weird ?
talking about them with you ?
no .
not really .
i got you something .
the journal ?
it &apos;s your family &apos;s . you should have it .
meredith and that idiot deputy were too busy questioning you
to give a damn about me .
sometimes it pays
to be the only normal one
in a town of vampires .
practically invisible .
are you ok ?
yeah . yeah . i &apos;m all right .
they let ric go .
sheriff forbes said she &apos;s out of suspects again ,
but ric is in the clear .
i know it may not seem like it , but ...
you did really well tonight .
i mean , before you know it ,
you &apos;re gonna be the king of moderation .
elena will understand .
doesn &apos;t really matter what elena thinks .
uh @-@ uh . none of that .
no more no humanity stefan .
there &apos;s a road called recovery ,
and we are on it .
why do you even care , huh ?
the whole brother @-@ bonding thing ,
getting elena to hate you .
why you feel guilty , because you kissed her ?
is that it , damon ?
because you can stop . go back to hating me .
it was a lot easier .
can you for one minute actually believe
that i &apos;m trying to help you ?
i don &apos;t need your help .
don &apos;t need my--
are you kidding me ?
do you remember what happened last time you said that ?
what are you talking about ?
1912 , stefan ,
the last time i convinced you to drink human blood .
go ahead , stefan .
pick one .
they &apos;re people , damon .
yes , they are people , stefan ,
people with blood pumping through their veins ,
waiting to be opened up and sucked dry .
you &apos;ve just forgotten how good it feels .
so had i , but sage ,
she reminded me ...
it &apos;s worth it .
it &apos;s all worth it .
not him , stefan .
not him ...
her .
she &apos;s the one .
i don &apos;t do that anymore .
but you can , stefan .
we can .
let the past be the past .
have a drink with me , brother .
i knew you still had it in you .
don &apos;t be greedy .
stefan . stefan .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m sorry .
stefan , stop .
stefan , stop .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
stefan , stop .
what did you do to me ? !
stefan .
what did you do to me ?
you just need to learn when to stop .
i can help you .
i don &apos;t need your help .
the founders &apos; council killer had nothing on you .
by decade &apos;s end ,
they were calling you the ripper of monterey .
i let you walk away .
i watched you go over the edge ,
and i didn &apos;t do anything to stop you .
you couldn &apos;t have .
sure , i could have .
but i just didn &apos;t want to .
but i want to now .
whenever you go too far ,
i will be there to pull you back ,
every second , every day
till you don &apos;t need me .
why ?
&apos;cause right now ...
you &apos;re all i got .
hey , i was gonna make some coffee .
i &apos;m good .
gonna head to bed in a few .
hey , listen , elena .
the , uh-- the sheriff told me about everything you did today , and ...
while i appreciate it ,
i don &apos;t want you getting in trouble because of me , ok ?
if not for you , for who ?
well , still , i--
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s supposed to look after you ,
even if i suck at it .
ok , well ,
how &apos; bout we just agree to take care of each other , then ?
deal .
what are you reading there ?
old family journal .
any juicy family secrets ?
it &apos;s hard to tell .
i mean , at first , i thought it was jonathan gilbert &apos;s journal ,
but it ended up being his granddaughter &apos;s ,
who apparently went just as crazy as he did ,
so great genes , huh ?
well , at least you have something to look forward to .
good night , ric .
night .
so i , uh--i dug into the old family archives from the early 1900s .
so now you want to be helpful .
want me to go back to being mad at you ?
what &apos;d you find ?
well , nothing from 1912 .
they never did arrest anyone for the founders &apos; murders ,
but they did get a confession 10 years later .
they did ? who ?
jonathan gilbert &apos;s granddaughter samantha .
they assumed she was crazy , locked her up in an insane asylum .
then what ?
trail ends there .
i mean , she was a founder .
you know they like to look out for their own .
samantha gilbert .
that is very weird .
why ?
because i &apos;m pretty sure i had already killed her .
i know what this looks like .
yeah ? well , i sure as hell don &apos;t .
you shoot me , you have me thrown in jail ,
and then you have me freed .
i did it for you , ric .
i forged the coroner &apos;s note to clear your name .
oh . you know what ? people are right .
you are psycho .
now that you &apos;ve been cleared ,
they &apos;ll look somewhere else .
they won &apos;t look your way again .
please , you have no reason ,
but i need you to trust me anyway .
if you let me in , i can explain .
i don &apos;t feel like myself .
i am losing time ...
as though i am going mad .
so you think samantha gilbert &apos;s
still alive , running around mystic falls ,
killing founders ?
it &apos;s not possible .
if she became a vampire , we &apos;d know about it , right ?
well , then she must have
had a ring that brought her back to life .
i mean , she was a--a gilbert , right ?
those rings are passed on through generations .
yeah , but even if she had a ring ,
she wouldn &apos;t be alive today .
doesn &apos;t protect her from old age .
jonathan gilbert only made two of those rings .
jeremy has one of them , and the other is ...
alaric &apos;s .
like the sheriff said ,
the victims were killed with your weapons .
why the stake ? he &apos;s not a vampire .
i know . this was a murder .
oh , my god . dad .
someone drove this stake through his heart .
it &apos;s one of ours .
yeah , but i was attacked .
with your own knife ,
a wound that could have been self @-@ inflicted .
it &apos;s impossible .
i would know if i were killing people .
would you ? have you had any blackouts ,
instances of lost time ?
y @-@ you &apos;re insane .
no , but i think you might be .
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death , ric .
