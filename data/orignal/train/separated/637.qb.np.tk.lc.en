my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this ,
and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
word is that conrad grayson
is writing his memoirs .
i would love to talk more about it .
what do you want ?
conrad grayson sent me .
if you want any future with your son ,
you leave now .
you can &apos;t deny that we &apos;ve made a good team .
i &apos;m declaring my independence .
you can &apos;t do this alone .
get the hell out of my house .
daniel wants his ex @-@ girlfriend to make our wedding cake .
do you suspect something &apos;s amiss ?
i think that you may be the one for daniel .
perhaps we could work together towards a common goal .
looks like they &apos;re about to rekindle their past .
then i have to make sure they have no future .
secrecy causes even the simplest truth
to seem wondrous , mysterious .
it has the power to fuel passion
and seduce you into becoming someone you &apos;re not .
we should get going soon .
you did tell your parents i was coming , right ?
or that i exist ?
i thought we &apos;d surprise them .
but what if your mother hates me ?
she won &apos;t .
and even if she does , i &apos;ll protect you .
but no matter how we try to guard our secrets ,
to keep them close ...
they all come out eventually .
i was hoping to get in there with you .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m--i &apos;m running late .
you &apos;ve been going in earlier and earlier all week .
maybe we could get lunch today .
find a secluded spot on the dock , have a picnic ...
yeah . i , uh ...
i can &apos;t today . i got too much to do .
i promise ... i &apos;ll make it up to you tomorrow .
i would hope so .
our bridal shower is tomorrow .
right .
i still don &apos;t get why my mother insisted it be co @-@ ed .
oh , everyone knows your mother prefers the company of men .
i &apos;m just happy you &apos;ll be there to protect me from her .
yeah .
that will be perfect , rohan .
i &apos;m on pins and needles .
that means i &apos;m excited to see you .
yes , perfect .
call me when you land . bye @-@ bye .
would you just , uh , dry @-@ clean the silks , please ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
well , i see you &apos;re still taking advantage of our amenities .
who was on the phone ?
oh , just a little surprise i &apos;m planning for the shower .
well , since you &apos;ve suddenly gotten into the spirit of things ,
maybe you wanna make the welcome toast ?
i lost my phone .
which relates how ?
well , i had the speech for emily saved on there ,
and i don &apos;t have time to recompose it .
probably for the best
since i didn &apos;t inherit your talent for faking sincerity .
it &apos;s called being polite .
and perhaps we wouldn &apos;t have to be
if sara had responded to my appeal .
i haven &apos;t heard from her all week .
maybe because she &apos;s too busy sneaking around with daniel .
i noticed her texting with him this morning ,
so whatever carrot you dangled , it seems to be working .
she won &apos;t stop digging .
margaux &apos;s determined to write this expos ?
she &apos;s convinced it &apos;ll help &quot; voulez &apos;s &quot; sales .
yeah , but what exactly did she discover ?
nothing yet , but she &apos;s researching articles
on grayson global , conrad ,
the acquision of nolcorp , you .
did she happen to see that i made , uh ,
&quot; people &apos;s &quot; sexiest men alive list ,
right behind joel mchale ?
so what if margaux manages to sniff out some truth ?
you know , maybe it &apos;s time that a little gets out there .
not when it involves conrad .
all i &apos;m asking is that if she contacts you ,
don &apos;t give her any leads .
all right .
what are you doing ?
roommate @-@ proofing .
aiden mathis is moving in .
are you kidding me ?
he &apos;s a decent guy .
who caused me to send my son away .
well , maybe that &apos;s not a bad thing .
you don &apos;t have to worry about carl &apos;s safety till the wedding &apos;s over ,
and when it is , they &apos;ll leave ,
and you won &apos;t ever have to see aiden again .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s leaving with emily ?
i didn &apos;t even know they were together .
ems .
didn &apos;t hear you sneak in .
just brought a few things for aiden .
thanks again for helping us out .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that that was your plan ?
you knew i was leaving .
with the guy who tried to strong @-@ arm me out of town ?
you conveniently left that part out .
you gave me a deadline to end this .
you don &apos;t get to pass judgment about what i do when it &apos;s done .
you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t .
hey . leaving so soon ?
i have a few more things to check off my list .
saw it first .
now because i &apos;m a gentleman , i &apos;ll hand it over .
a gentleman or a stalker ?
your text said you &apos;d be here ,
buying ingredients for my wedding cake .
that wasn &apos;t an invite ?
no ?
all right , i &apos;ll go .
no . don &apos;t , don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
i know emily wanted lemon ,
but , uh , i was just toying with a strawberry layer .
but you know your fiancee better than i do .
you think she &apos;ll put up a fight ?
sara ...
what am i doing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just , uh ...
this isn &apos;t like me , danny .
my father ditched my mom for another woman .
i do not want to do that to emily .
i haven &apos;t been able to get you out of my head
since the fourth of july .
yeah , well ... you need to .
we both do .
do we ?
i mean that , honestly .
if we could just talk about all
talk about it ? you &apos;re getting married--
you &apos;re getting married in two weeks , danny .
you should be talking to your fiancé .
you &apos;re right .
i know . i know .
i just can &apos;t ...
help but wonder why you &apos;ve come into my life when you did .
well , uh ...
it was good to see you .
keep the change .
thank you .
danny ! wait .
i &apos;ll be here sunday ...
in case you &apos;re free .
okay .
see you .
hello , sara .
i should &apos;ve ...
gotten the hint when danny blew me off this morning .
i came to surprise him for lunch .
when i saw him pulling out of his parking lot ,
i followed him here .
how long has it been going on ?
this isn &apos;t what it looks like , emily .
really ? so it &apos;s just a coincidence that you ...
ran into each other here ,
just like at the bakery and--
no , emily ,
you have misunderstood this whole situation .
have i really ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
i guess it &apos;s just the stress of the wedding .
and god , victoria--
she constantly t @-@ treats me like i &apos;m not good enough .
oh , she does that to everyone .
not you .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re the kind of girl a mother loves .
that &apos;s why i feel so threatened by you .
thanks .
i am not perfect . okay ?
but you have to believe me .
i am not a home wrecker .
god , i &apos;m sorry for breaking down on you .
it &apos;s okay .
do me a favor-- don &apos;t tell daniel .
i &apos;m embarrassed enough as it is .
you shouldn &apos;t be .
thank you .
we want that to be here .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah , that should work .
mr. grayson .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d get to read pages so soon .
sadly , you don &apos;t .
in fact , you &apos;ll have to wait until the book hits the shelves .
since our preliminary discussion ,
i was offered a more lucrative deal
from another publishing company .
you used my generosity to start a bidding war .
oh , no . no , no . i just ...
created my own marketplace .
it &apos;s a lesson every young entrepreneur should learn ,
as referenced in my prologue .
don &apos;t forget to preorder .
how you must miss the grandeur of your last office .
oh , what we lack in space ,
we also lack in illegal activity .
you &apos;re not still going forward with margaux ?
i told you , she &apos;s been investigating last year &apos;s events
and what happened in &apos; 93 .
i took your advice and i moved on .
these are for you .
since you &apos;ve always fancied yourself a writer ,
i thought maybe you could help me brainstorm a title .
sure , but not today . i can &apos;t . i &apos;m swamped .
oh .
and yet , you still found time to shop for organic berries .
did you pick them yourself ?
i stopped by the farmers &apos; market .
all my years on this earth ,
there is only one thing that &apos;s taken me to places
i &apos;d otherwise avoid .
i was meeting a friend .
a &quot; friend &quot; ?
or an ex ?
your mother mentioned
that you hired sara to make your wedding cake .
i thought that an odd choice .
i &apos;m just trying to help get her back on her feet , okay ?
i owe her that much after what we put her through .
wow . how noble of you .
and i think you are ready .
ready for what ?
for a grayson rite of passage .
why don &apos;t you come with me into the city ?
that family is hiding something .
i &apos;ve been collecting names of grayson global employees .
one of them will be willing to share their account .
i know you &apos;re afraid of what daniel might do , but just ...
talk to nolan .
i mean , if there &apos;s a story to tell , he &apos;ll tell it .
and if not , there &apos;s no need to waste any more time on it .
yeah , i &apos;ll try him tomorrow at the shower .
thanks for letting me vent .
oh . of course .
but i need to go back to work .
yeah . i &apos;ll walk you out .
see you later .
and to think , you owe me for that .
i am a miraculous matchmaker .
if only i could matchmake myself .
you &apos;ll find someone .
i can &apos;t even find my phone .
figured i &apos;d just buy a new one .
so that &apos;s my exciting life . what &apos;s new with you ?
not much . but , um ...
i wanted to ask you ,
what do you know about aiden mathis ?
are you in trouble ? because all i know about him
is that &apos;s what he handled for my parents .
he dealt with the messes they didn &apos;t want to .
why do you ask ?
nolan brought him up . i was just curious .
is everything okay ?
主题 想念这些吗 夏洛特
yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
rule number 17-- no fish for breakfast .
18--no killing on the premises .
well , to be disregarded if , uh , my life is in danger .
i &apos;ll bear that in mind .
ah . most importantly , 19--
always give a heads up call before coming home .
i am on the rebound ,
so , bitch , don &apos;t kill my vibe .
hmm . as you can see ,
some people never follow the &quot; call first &quot; rule .
welcome back .
i am pleased to report that the maldives ...
eagerly awaits our arrival .
so ... twisted , isn &apos;t it ?
planning a wedding with one guy ,
and honeymoon with another ?
there won &apos;t be a honeymoon
if we don &apos;t get the final details in place .
我要和你谈谈
i assume that you &apos;re not referring to
your garter and daniel &apos;s boutonniere .
primarily , tying victoria to the murder weapon .
since you &apos;ve been exiled from grayson manor--
i could probably help .
no , i don &apos;t want your fingerprints on any of this .
look , i can handle this . that &apos;s why i &apos;m back here .
um , just keep an eye on victoria .
and considering she hasn &apos;t contacted me ,
she must believe she &apos;s got another way
of thwarting you and daniel .
then we &apos;ll let her believe that .
right in here .
sara . how lovely to see you .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t return any of your calls .
oh , for good reason .
i hear you &apos;ve been very busy with daniel .
oh , please tell me i can scrap these wedding plans .
i can &apos;t speak for danny , but , uh ...
as for me ...
i &apos;m not gonna help you break up their engagement .
sara , regret will haunt you if you let daniel go .
well , i &apos;d rather deal with that
than the shame of breaking up a marriage .
there is no shame when it comes to daniel &apos;s best interests .
but who &apos;s to say it is ?
emily &apos;s sweet , sincere , and exactly what danny needs .
she loves him just as much as you do , if not more .
i don &apos;t know what lies that girl sold you ,
but she cares about nothing but money and status .
sara , i can prove it to you . please ?
please give me a chance .
for daniel &apos;s sake , please .
well , if we &apos;ve owned this place for decades ,
why is this the first i &apos;m hearing of it ?
you haven &apos;t yet earned your spot in the club .
soon you &apos;ll be married ,
and your dues will be paid .
how the hell did you keep this from mom
when we were in the red ?
because the deed is solely in my name ,
given to me by my father , whose father gave it to him .
no mrs. grayson has ever known about it .
you see , contrary to what they say ,
the secret to staying happily married is secrecy .
i &apos;m not keeping things from emily , dad .
so i guess she knows about
your little trip to the farmers &apos; market .
look , daniel , even titans need a safe harbor from the storms--
professional or personal .
and you can trust anderson here
to keep the nature of your escapades close to his vest .
i don &apos;t want to cheat on my wife .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of , daniel .
look , i &apos;m gonna put this to you as my father put it to me
when he first brought me here-- do not marry your mistress .
emily is your perfect match .
so if you get bored , you know , switch paramours , not wives .
for one thing , it &apos;s far more cost @-@ effective .
i mean , not that affairs are cheap .
i spent a pretty penny on a minx from the rainbow room ,
one ... too many of my secretaries ,
and let &apos;s not forget lydia ...
may she rest in peace .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;ve reached the day
where i give you the keys to this place .
what if i don &apos;t want &apos; em ?
well , then i applaud your idealism
and say you stand by your morals for as long as you can .
but if you find yourself slipping ,
just know that this is a place where you can fall ...
without regret .
daniel and i said
we weren &apos;t gonna exchange gifts at the shower ,
but this morning i found this in the closet .
can you just estimate its value
so i can match the sentiment ?
mm ... 5k ? 7 tops .
slightly modest for a grayson wedding gift , no ?
well , at least it proves that he &apos;s back on track ,
now that sara &apos;s out of the equation .
how can you be so sure ?
i checked his phone .
she hasn &apos;t returned any of his texts
since my little breakdown yesterday .
god , wish i could cry on a dime .
it would help sell my performance at your wedding .
oh . for daniel--
white gold , self @-@ winding , 7k . done .
what about this one ?
the logan seafarer .
press a button , it sends out an emergency transmission .
you could be lost in the bermuda triangle ,
and help would come in 30 minutes or less .
that seems a little bit excessive .
i meant for you .
considering what you &apos;re trying to pull off
at this wedding ,
having a plan &quot; b &quot; couldn &apos;t hurt .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not here for you .
whoever you &apos;re here for , you &apos;re not welcome--
not after your last visit .
jack , i was just trying to protect your family .
i lost my father at a young age
and my sister not long after ,
so i know the pain of being ripped apart
from your own flesh and blood .
it was never my intention to separate you from your son .
okay . well , let &apos;s just hope you &apos;ve done a better job
of thinking things through when it comes to emily .
are you trying to vet me , jack ?
seems you &apos;ve gone to great lengths to protect her mission .
but what about her ?
it &apos;s endearing what you &apos;re doing ,
but you &apos;ve no right .
i know the two of you had
what could only be described as puppy love ,
but that &apos;s the past , and it &apos;s forgotten .
i &apos;m the future .
you trying to convince me or yourself ?
oh , i do hope we have your support going forward , jack ,
because i don &apos;t deal with complications as well as emily .
thanks for meeting me .
i have no one else to turn to .
i find that hard to believe , as you barely know me .
and i can &apos;t imagine i got jack &apos;s recommendation .
i know what you did for my parents ,
and i need you to do the same for me .
well , what are we talking about exactly ?
when i went to europe , i met this guy .
a photographer .
things happened , and he took some ...
artistic shots of me .
nude .
i was in an awful headspace .
some creep stole my phone , found the photos ,
and now he &apos;s blackmailing me .
you do know i don &apos;t work for your parents anymore , right ?
good . this can &apos;t get back to them .
or anyone else , for that matter .
okay . well , how did he contact you ?
by e @-@ mail .
he wants 40 grand .
can you make it go away ?
look , i &apos;m--i &apos;m already late to my brother &apos;s shower , so--
no . um , give me your ... computer .
i &apos;ll , um ... establish contact . i &apos;ll take it from there .
how much is it gonna cost me ?
no , don &apos;t sweat it .
first one &apos;s free .
i &apos;m surprised you got my mother a hostess present .
you playing nice ?
not for her .
i thought ... i thought we said no gifts .
well , now i feel like a jackass .
i @-@ i left yours at home .
oh , you can give it to me later .
oh , welcome , darlings .
i hope that everything pleases you .
no expense was spared
to meet all of your expectations , emily ,
and all of your desires , daniel .
in fact ,
i hired ms. munello to handle today &apos;s festivities .
after all ,
it isn &apos;t the worst idea to get a taste of what &apos;s to come .
it took some time for my brother
to find someone who &apos;d put up with him .
and i get that . he can be annoying .
but he &apos;s still my best friend .
so , emily , be good to him ,
or you &apos;ll have me to deal with .
to daniel and emily .
to daniel and emily .
i see you drank to that .
refills ?
i &apos;ll get us all one .
that was lovely , charlotte . thank you .
i meant every word .
ms. grayson ? someone phoned for you .
excuse me .
well , now who &apos;s the stalker ?
well , at least i have a legitimate excuse .
do you ? when i saw you yesterday ,
you didn &apos;t mention you &apos;d be working the party .
well , uh , it was a last @-@ minute offer ,
and , well , i couldn &apos;t afford to say no .
well , just so long as you &apos;re working for my mother
not with her ?
why would you say that ?
because she seems abnormally giddy today ,
and that usually means she &apos;s up to something .
i should get back to work .
it &apos;s not like we can &apos;t talk to each other , sara .
we &apos;re not doing anything wrong .
it &apos;s the fact that we want to .
hello again , sara .
em , can you believe these little things ?
they &apos;re like cakes for elves .
wow . sara really can do it all , can &apos;t she ?
thanks to you , i know our wedding &apos;s gonna be perfect .
gather around , everyone .
we &apos;re going to play a little game .
conrad , daniel , come here .
since when does my mother play games ?
i know you were expecting somebody far prettier ,
but charlotte sends her regrets .
i take it you brought the phone ?
look , man , my deal &apos;s with the girl .
well , i &apos;m her representative . you can give it to me .
not until i see the money , i &apos;m not .
okay , $ 40,000 , right ?
you see , i &apos;m not sure that that &apos;s very fair .
oh ? well , see , uh , tmz , they &apos;re--
they &apos;re willing to pay almost as much .
you know , they pay top dollar for celeb nudie photographs .
yeah , but what &apos;s the price for a girl &apos;s innocence ?
that slut is anything but innocent .
you know that &apos;s someone &apos;s little girl .
that &apos;s someone &apos;s sister .
whatever your thing is , i don &apos;t--
hey , hey , hey ! break it up ! break it up ! take it easy !
remember what i said about complications , jack ?
don &apos;t be one .
jack , leave him alone .
while i &apos;m not the type
to partake in wedding shower games ,
my wife insisted .
and as my son will soon learn ,
your wife not only dictates
the games you play and the rules ,
but somehow she always wins .
and today , she has conjured up
her own modest version of &quot; this is your life . &quot;
and we invite you
to take a trip with daniel down memory lane .
now as many of you know , i &apos;m writing my memoirs--
ah , how &apos;s that for a shameless plug ?
and in doing so ,
i &apos;ve been recalling danny &apos;s many nicknames .
he was &quot; graystroke &quot; at harvard ,
&quot; boone &quot; at summer camp ,
and in high school , his lacrosse team dubbed him ...
&quot; ankle breaker , &quot; &apos;
cause he broke mine during j.v. playoffs .
james dennis .
how you doing ?
good to see you .
well done .
conrad screwed me over .
a feeling you must be all too familiar with .
seems all your hardships began
after grayson global &apos;s acquisition of nolcorp .
my problems started long before that , kitten .
and as much as i would love to scapegoat conrad for them ,
it &apos;s not my style .
but take it from someone who was the inside--
there &apos;s nothing about grayson global
that &apos;s worth writing in a bathroom stall ,
let alone in a book .
end of story .
too bad .
it seems it &apos;s time i moved on .
smart girl .
emily , come join me , will you ?
ah . well , it breaks my heart
that emily has so few friends and family ,
especially since moments like these
should be shared by loved ones .
finding someone to participate today was no easy feat ,
but ... i did stumble upon a very old acquaintance .
he &apos;s very handsome ,
a bit of a silver fox ,
and extremely wealthy .
surely you haven &apos;t forgotten that .
after all ...
he was your husband .
what ?
kya haal chaal hai , emily ?
rohan .
i can &apos;t believe it .
what are you doing , victoria ?
never do you write or call .
i see now why .
how busy you must be with this young one .
how i missed you so .
this is a joke , right ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
it was a marriage of convenience .
oh . i hadn &apos;t realized that .
it wasn &apos;t my most honest moment , but ...
i did it to help rohan .
oh ? with what ?
true love .
i was being in danger of deportation ,
and i had just fallen for someone .
i helped rohan obtain his green card
so that he could stay with his partner benny . hi !
you told me on the phone
that the marriage was a disaster and left you penniless .
you said that ?
well , my english sometimes up and down .
it was ro who almost bled me dry
in the brief time that we were together .
he &apos;s never been good with money .
he still isn &apos;t .
but enough of me .
to emily , who helped me find love .
how happy i am that she has found hers .
i am on the pins and needles for you and daniel .
it means &quot; excited , &quot; yes ?
victoria , what a thoughtful gift .
i must find a way to repay you .
daniel , i should &apos;ve told you .
just by the time we were engaged , i ...
i felt awkward bringing it up .
i should &apos;ve known that your mother would try to use it against me .
well , yeah , that &apos;s what she does .
you took it in stride , though .
well , i guess i &apos;m getting used to it .
i &apos;d love for you to meet rohan .
yes .
so now you &apos;ve seen her ability to spin the truth .
hers or yours ?
i should never have come here .
i was naive ... or hopeful .
yeah , maybe you &apos;re right that
emily and danny won &apos;t work out .
but it won &apos;t be her fault .
you cannot be fooled by that girl .
you think you &apos;re protecting your son ...
but your psycho obsession &apos;s only hurting him .
let him go .
i &apos;m gonna do the same .
good @-@ bye , victoria .
you were schooled in revenge , too ?
when i first went to japan , rohan was training with takeda .
he &apos;s since completed his mission .
oh . well , how did yours end ?
is the person who wronged you in jail ?
dead ?
worse ?
we &apos;re taught once our goal &apos;s complete ,
not to mention it again .
don &apos;t brag after a shag .
got it .
though the whole green card thing ,
i assume that was part of today &apos;s act .
no , no .
emily actually did that for me .
thanks to her , i found happiness after revenge .
i hope she &apos;ll find the same .
so you were married ,
but you weren &apos;t a gold digger ?
no , no . rohan made his fortune long before we met .
not by digging gold , but mining rubies .
ooh , i almost forgot ...
you bought the seafarer .
i was hoping you could set it in something more suitable for a bride .
a ruby , perhaps ?
red is her favorite color .
it &apos;ll be my wedding present to you .
benny &apos;s waiting .
thank you . bye .
when you confessed to bizzy preston about your marriage ,
you knew that victoria would take the bait ,
and spend the next two weeks chasing her tail .
and anyone who was there today
can testify to how desperate victoria was
to destroy my engagement .
the evidence does keep piling up .
this is gonna be one hell of a wedding .
i wasn &apos;t sure you got my text .
danny . um ...
i only came to say that i won &apos;t be making your wedding cake .
and ... good @-@ bye .
what ?
is this--is this because i accused you of working with my mother ?
if--if so , i &apos;m sorry .
no , no . please don &apos;t be . you weren &apos;t wrong .
okay , for the past two weeks ,
she &apos;s been trying to snake charm me
into coming between you and emily .
and--and i couldn &apos;t do that .
especially after what i saw today .
oh , well , after what i saw ,
i don &apos;t think i can go through with this wedding .
and it took until today to realize
that emily and my mother are the same person .
and i do not wanna marry my mother .
can i show you something ?
remember this ?
i gave it to you that summer .
i never told you , but ...
after the accident , i thought i &apos;d lost you .
i spent that night pacing the hospital halls ,
by the time the doctors came by to tell me that you were stable ,
the diamond had cut into my palm from clenching it so tightly .
i mean , i didn &apos;t even realize the e.m.t.s had given it to me .
you held onto it all this time .
i never ...
thought you &apos;d allow me the chance to return it .
we can &apos;t undo our past , danny .
i know .
i just don &apos;t wanna forget it , either .
can i ?
i &apos;m not asking you to commit to anything .
i just can &apos;t commit to emily ,
not when i feel this way about you .
i won &apos;t risk losing you again .
mm . no . no , no , no .
no , we can &apos;t do this .
okay ? not until you &apos;ve spoken to her .
we won &apos;t . we won &apos;t .
i just don &apos;t wanna say good night .
someone had the daft idea of sending these here after the shower .
and i thought that you might want to take these home .
so you could get an early start on your thank @-@ yous .
it seems you could &apos;ve had your staff bring them down toy house .
oh yes ,
but there &apos;s one gift i wouldn &apos;t trust anyone to deliver .
but you &apos;ve already given me the greatest gift , victoria .
it was lovely to see rohan again .
emily ...
had i known that you were keeping such a secret from daniel .
that what you were banking on , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
you &apos;ve always known that i doubted your devotion to my son .
and i &apos;ve never questioned his until now .
what &apos;s this ?
you see , for years ,
the grayson men have had a little pied a terre near the met .
and they &apos;ve passed it down from generation to generation ,
one after another have strutted around ,
thinking their wives were clueless about their liaisons .
but we &apos;ve always known if we wished to .
and we &apos;ve passed that little card
to each new future mrs. grayson .
as a sort of wedding gift .
well , i appreciate the gesture , victoria ,
but daniel and i are nothing like you and conrad .
we &apos;re more alike than you think .
go on .
see for yourself .
hello again , mrs. grayson .
it seems your son and his lady friend
have settled in for the night .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
anderson , can we get some more ice , please ?
right away , mr. grayson .
no .
that &apos;ll be all .
you alone ?
yeah . daniel &apos;s in the city .
good , &apos; cause i wanna talk to you . it &apos;s about your sister .
okay .
some guy stole her phone .
he was apparently blackmailing her with it .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s fine ,
because your boyfriend beat the hell out of him in my bar .
aiden did ?
brutally .
and i can see from your reaction that he hasn &apos;t told you .
now you told me it &apos;s none of my business
what happens when this is all over .
but how well do you know aiden ?
i thought this was about my sister .
where did you meet him ?
we trained together .
we &apos;re a lot alike . he lost his family , too .
so i heard .
what do you want , jack ?
i wanna know that you know what you &apos;re doing .
of course i do .
would you even tell me if you didn &apos;t ?
you were always secretive .
even when we were kids , and you &apos;d see a shooting star ,
you &apos;d never tell me what you wished for .
i realize now it &apos;s not because you didn &apos;t think
it was gonna come true . it &apos;s because ...
you &apos;re afraid .
of what ?
of letting people in .
you know , maybe i was a lot smarter then ,
because had i not told you the truth , who i really am ,
maybe you wouldn &apos;t hate me right now .
i could never hate you .
and not for lack of trying .
it &apos;s just , after seeing aiden today , i ...
i think you deserve more than you &apos;re getting .
you don &apos;t even know him .
and to be honest , you don &apos;t know me .
not anymore .
you &apos;re right .
you wanna know what i used to wish for ?
that nothing would ever change .
you didn &apos;t call first .
what if i had had company ?
well , looks like you already got rid of them .
or you didn &apos;t .
should i be concerned ?
turns out i didn &apos;t need to be inside grayson manor
to play my part .
i borrowed charlotte &apos;s laptop ,
got her i.p. address , wi @-@ fi code ,
mummy &apos;s credit card details .
now you tell me . but ... that &apos;s everything we need
to set up victoria as the buyer of the murder weapon .
i , uh , assume emily knows you took advantage of her baby sis ?
i merely took advantage of an opportunity
whilst helping charlotte .
there was no need to pester emily with the details .
look , this isn &apos;t gonna be a thing , is it ?
you giving me guilt about
how i need to openly communicate with my girlfriend ?
no . i just--
good ,
because there &apos;s something i need you to do ,
and it &apos;s incredibly important .
this stays between you and me .
&quot; the choices we make &quot; ?
daniel , uh , chose it .
simple but profound ,
considering the lesson i &apos;ve been trying to pass down to him .
and what is that exactly ?
discretion ...
is essential in all facets life .
you know , i may have single @-@ handedly saved
daniel &apos;s relationship with emily .
i think that you might have some rewrites to do
once he calls off this wedding .
are you still in denial
about how your transparent shower stunt backfired ?
oh , come on . i know you were rooting for the other woman .
not surprising , considering you were one .
mm . thank god those days are over .
hmm . do you remember that terribly obvious bachelor pad you took me to ?
oh , i ...
i got rid of that place years ago .
i &apos;m all yours now , darlin &apos; .
pity .
we need to talk .
me first .
but you already gave me a watch .
well , this wasn &apos;t planned .
but before you open it ,
i have something to confess to you , daniel .
i followed you .
i saw you and sara at the farmers &apos; market yesterday .
after you left ,
i confronted her .
and i broke down on that poor girl .
you know i trust you . i just ...
couldn &apos;t get a hold of my emotions .
it was so unlike me that
i realized something else must be going on .
so i went to the doctor .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m great .
as it turns out ...
we &apos;re pregnant .
look .
hey . sorry i missed you earlier .
you want to , uh , you wanna come by tonight ?
i can &apos;t . i have a last minute meeting in the city .
that sounds mysterious .
it is .
someone contacted me , claiming to know enough about conrad
to fill a book of their own .
probably some lunatic looking for cash .
after my disappointing chat
with nolan ross today ,
my fervor for the story is dying .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
well , not if it means more time for nightcaps with you .
good night , jack .
good night .
ah , you made it .
thanks for meeting with me , ms. davis .
it &apos;s lydia .
and believe me , the pleasure is all mine .
