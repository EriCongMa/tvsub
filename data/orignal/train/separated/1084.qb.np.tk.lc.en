pink panthers , the most dangerous gang of thieves in the world .
neal plans to infiltrate the gang .
they promised you freedom before .
what makes you think this time they &apos;ll deliver ?
who says that &apos;s all i &apos;m after ?
how long you been working for interpol ?
how did you know i was working for them ?
they insert chips under the skin of their informants like dogs .
it &apos;s hard enough putting the bad guys in prison
without the good guys letting them out .
luc renaud .
i will do whatever is necessary to bring down the panthers .
ah , look at this ,
one big happy family .
this can either be a joint f.b.i and interpol case
or just f.b.i.
your choice .
the panthers , neal , they don &apos;t stop looking for rats until they &apos;re dead .
until then , guess who they go after .
people closest to you .
you &apos;ve told them about my extensive contributions ,
haven &apos;t you ?
you know how much i appreciate it .
not enough to mention me to your new friends .
the panthers aren &apos;t my friends .
they &apos;re going after cash .
and not just any cash .
each shipment contains as much as $ 500 million .
woodford .
there &apos;s a small problem .
seems there &apos;s a mole in the operation .
a mole ?
that &apos;s a serious problem .
it &apos;s a catastrophic one .
he could bring down this operation
cost me the rest of my life in prison .
why tell me ?
you are the only one i &apos;m sure isn &apos;t the mole .
i discovered a listening device in one of my hideouts
before you joined us .
it &apos;s the reason i &apos;ve kept the plan close to my vest .
i came here to ask a favor .
anything .
dig up the mole .
anything but that .
the only thing worse than a mole is a rat .
i &apos;ve never been one . i never will be .
that just might be a better answer than &quot; yes . &quot;
now i know there &apos;s someone i can trust completely .
i &apos;ll find the traitor myself .
what if you can &apos;t ?
i &apos;ll put the plan to bed ,
go underground for a while .
what ? you &apos;d just walk away ?
nothing &apos;s worth spending the rest of one &apos;s life incarcerated .
not even 1 / 2 billion in cash .
1 / 2 billion .
what are you planning to hit , the federal reserve ?
what &apos;s all that ?
research .
background checks .
eyewitness testimonies .
looks serious .
extremely .
i &apos;ve narrowed it down to these five .
why are they all in white coats ?
they &apos;re obstetricians .
from what i &apos;ve uncovered , the finest in new york .
you should be safe with any of them .
honey , you do know that i already have an ob @-@ gyn , right ?
you do ?
is he any one of them ?
she &apos;s right here .
i did a background check on her ?
ten years ago .
i did .
yeah .
you need to stop worrying .
my pregnancy is not a case .
what if i gave the baby a tiny little anklet ?
neal &apos;s is very comforting .
no ?
no .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna get to see a sonogram .
yeah .
we &apos;re gonna meet our baby .
i can &apos;t wait .
what if the doctor sees something ?
then we know it &apos;s a boy .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
i know it &apos;s not what you meant .
honey , listen , our baby is fine .
we &apos;ve waited so long for this .
can &apos;t you just enjoy it ?
i &apos;m loving every minute .
good .
so i &apos;ve dodged the mole hunt for now .
that &apos;s why the panthers were laying low .
it had nothing to do with san francisco .
but if woodford doesn &apos;t get his moles ,
the operation &apos;s finished .
mole , singular . not a labor .
half and half ?
thought you switched to soy .
i switched back .
a labor ?
a group of more than one mole .
theo likes gardening shows .
woodford is looking for one , and he has two .
i like my odds .
we give him keller .
oh , hang a snitch suit on him .
won &apos;t keller talk to save his own neck ?
not if luc pulls him first .
if i get keller pulled , you promote it that keller ran
because woodford was closing in .
then who do you say keller was working for ?
i &apos;ll keep it a mystery ,
but woodford will know the threat &apos;s removed .
until then , i impress him
with my knowledge of the algorithm .
tell him what we taught you .
maybe he &apos;ll fill in the blanks .
that san francisco flight reveal anything new ?
not really .
woodford say anything ?
got to meet him now .
better take this to go .
see you .
great .
think he knows about the cash ?
if he does , why isn &apos;t he telling us ?
1 / 2 billion &apos;s enough to lead anyone into temptation .
especially caffrey .
especially off anklet .
i ran a wall street scam last year
manipulating algorithms ,
so when i printed out the exodus file ...
you knew what it was .
and what it does .
it randomly picks airports and airlines ,
among other things .
and those other things are ?
for one , after everything &apos;s selected ,
there &apos;s only a 12 @-@ hour window until the money arrives .
no time to travel or prepare ,
so you must be waiting for the money to be playing at an airport near you .
you are everything that keller says you are .
let &apos;s be clear .
keller and i were competitors ,
adversaries for the most part ,
and not what you &apos;d call friendly now .
i find friendships within gangs dangerous .
so is hitting an airport .
it &apos;s ambitious under any circumstances .
with only hours to plan , it &apos;s next to impossible .
the panthers have never shied away from difficulty .
so you have a way in and a way out ?
follow me .
any idea how a bug got into one of woodford &apos;s hideouts ?
does &quot; how &quot; matter ?
what is important is that it was found .
come on , luc .
we &apos;re working together .
let &apos;s at least try to be honest with each other .
you planted that bug ,
but not for woodford .
you were spying on your spy .
if that is true , can you blame me ?
yes , i can .
when neal &apos;s undercover , i have to trust him .
his life and the operation depends on it .
and how many times has that proven to be a mistake ?
this time , the mistake is yours .
woodford knows there &apos;s a mole ,
and right now , we have to give him one .
very nice of you to offer yours .
i wasn &apos;t offering mine .
no , we need to pull keller .
but with this , i know where he is at all times .
you can no longer say the same for caffrey .
keller can turn off his rfid chip anytime he wants .
only if he is being scanned .
and if it stays off for more than 15 minutes ,
he knows i will move in .
so you know where he is but not what he &apos;s up to .
i can count on neal to do the right thing .
you screwed yourself .
thanks to your bug , woodford trusts neal
and no one else .
now , the good news is , you still have an inside man .
neal will work for us .
we &apos;re partners in this .
what &apos;s mine is yours .
if we take down the panthers ,
keller will get his deal ,
and you will share in the credit .
perhaps it &apos;s time for keller to go .
pull keller today before woodford
gets cold feet and pulls up stakes .
let &apos;s take down the panthers , luc .
you and me , together .
peter .
yeah .
hey , i was just about to tell you ,
i took care of the problem .
luc agreed to pull keller .
now keller is the least of our worries .
they got guns .
i &apos;ll go back with bells on .
i &apos;m safe behind bars .
fleecing guards .
and , oh , man , the beautiful privileges
they smuggle in to pay off their debts .
not the reaction i was expecting .
yeah , what do you want ?
look , you guys take down the panthers ,
i still get my deal , right ?
i &apos;m out in , what , a week or two ?
it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
seriously , anything i can do to help .
there &apos;s one thing .
what ?
technically , i &apos;m still your prisoner ,
and you &apos;re my keeper , right ?
and you and i were never partners ,
but your success , luc , is my success .
it goes south for you , it goes south for me .
and caffrey ?
he has a way of making everything go south
for everyone but him .
how much firepower ?
just shy of nuclear .
this can &apos;t happen at an airport .
we &apos;re gonna have to bring down the panthers now .
no other choice .
for what ?
conspiracy ?
the entire case would hinge on the testimony
of two criminal informants .
i don &apos;t care .
we shut it down now ,
whether we have enough on the panthers or not .
too many lives are at risk .
what if i can convince woodford i have a better way ?
do you ?
guns were never a major part of their previous jobs .
find out why .
then convince him the old ways were better .
you want the outcome of this case
to rest on caffrey &apos;s slippery shoulders ?
you &apos;re always manipulating , matthew .
yeah , well , not this time .
i already told you , i want you to succeed .
your win is my win , man .
any new plan passes through me
before woodford hears it .
why wouldn &apos;t it ? we &apos;re partners .
yeah , the partner routine may have worked with luc ,
but you and i ?
let &apos;s just say good anklets make for good partners .
okay .
but i got to say ...
yeah ?
this has been more fun
than a prison sentence has any right to be .
hey , i don &apos;t want any surprises .
i don &apos;t want to be left in the dark .
full illumination .
and if there are any guns involved--
the operation gets shut down . don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve got this handled .
you sure ?
your separation anxiety has spiraled into control anxiety .
big @-@ time .
you better get used to it .
why ?
you &apos;re gonna be a father .
hey , partner .
be careful out there .
always .
come .
admire ingenuity in its most rudimentary form .
disco inferno ?
despite being a mere toddler during the whole craze ,
i regret never wearing a &quot; disco sucks &quot; t @-@ shirt .
it had its time and place , moz .
well , for the past 35 hours ,
my time has been spent consumed by this .
behold the randomizer .
for our little algorithm .
yeah . watch closely .
the red lights-- international airports .
green ones-- international carriers .
and the white just to give it the full christmas effect ?
the white lights represent variables
that your genius friends
at the f.b.i failed to identify ,
variables which i believe , due to their sheer number ,
represent airport warehouses .
warehouses ?
where they store the cash when it arrives .
well , not that i &apos;m complaining ,
but why warehouses and not vaults ?
vaults come after the federal reserve
come to pick up the cash from the warehouse .
wait a second . airports .
cash from overseas .
the federal reserve .
moz ...
whispered about
whenever thieves gather to tell lies to each other .
denied by all governments .
the one thing that draws a blank on google .
the score of scores .
the exchange .
unmarked and untraceable yankee tourist dollars ,
gathered and lovingly swaddled by central banks
all over the world ...
before being flown back to the u.s. for redistribution .
but the only thing is ,
no one knows where
or when or who
until the algorithm has its way with a computer .
chicago o &apos;hare .
aviana airways .
warehouse nine .
i love the light show , moz ,
but we already knew what the algorithm did
and why woodford is waiting
until the money comes to him .
woodford has it , but he can &apos;t control it .
we can .
you can bring the mountain to muhammad ?
yes . i &apos;ve adjusted the algorithm .
let &apos;s route some money to jfk international ...
via oceanic airways ,
flight 1097 .
you are a truly talented man .
talent hits a target no one else can hit .
genius hits a target no one else can see .
all right , this should convince woodford
that we have enough time to come up with a better plan .
oh , so you need me to explain it to him ,
demonstrate how it all works ?
whoa , patience .
look , woodford is on a mole hunt .
why risk it now ?
for you .
so i can watch your back .
moz .
you know , this hasn &apos;t always been about you protecting me .
i know .
you need me there .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
the minute i see an opening .
until then , i need to tell peter what you &apos;ve done here .
this is amazing .
thank you .
the minute i see an opening , okay ?
our inside man has outside business .
who is she ?
f.b.i case . can &apos;t discuss .
cannot discuss or do not know ?
neal and i are still working on other investigations .
you won &apos;t admit the truth because then i would be right .
no , it &apos;s not about being right .
it &apos;s about bringing down the panthers .
do you trust caffrey ?
i do .
that will be your undoing , not mine .
i &apos;m sending keller back in .
you &apos;ll destroy this operation .
no , you will destroy it
if you do not pull your c.i.
i will not pull neal .
i no longer see ourselves as collaborators , agent burke .
do what you have to do , and i will do the same .
jones .
you know where this is ?
no , but i can find out .
call me when you do .
i &apos;m feeling the need for a surprise inspection .
where &apos;s neal ?
oh , he went to talk to you .
i haven &apos;t seen him for hours .
and you were in your office ?
until i came here .
that &apos;s weird .
in the purloin world , the pink panthers are royalty .
no one better , before or since .
that &apos;s why i risked my life to join .
and almost lost it .
that diamond mart heist in barcelona ,
you walked in as rug merchants and walked out with what ?
30 million ?
only 14 , i &apos;m afraid , after fencing .
still , 14 million without an alarm going off ,
without a shot fired .
why use guns on this job ?
elegant heists take weeks ,
sometimes a year , to prepare .
due to the algorithm ,
we will have , at best , a couple of hours .
guns are the only option .
what if i can give you days ?
what if i can make the algorithm
do what we want it to do ?
if only that were possible .
control the algorithm , control the heist .
i can override the system .
we pick the airports .
we choose the flights .
we tell them where to deliver our cash .
it can &apos;t be done .
have i let you down yet ?
quite the opposite .
for years , you guys have inspired me .
you made me strive to be a better thief .
let me prove myself to you .
allow me to help you come up with a new plan .
without guns ?
guns only if it fails ,
but it won &apos;t fail .
you can really control the algorithm .
yeah . i &apos;ll show you .
well , that would be brilliant .
the means should always justify the end .
all right .
let &apos;s create a work of art .
and be the talk of thieves around the globe .
peter is covering for him .
told you .
i want you back in right away .
i never left .
what about this mole situation ?
he wants a mole , give him one .
consider it done .
you two have been spending an awful lot of time together .
i fear bonding .
me and the suit ? no .
never . ever .
i want answers .
to any particular question ?
you &apos;re holding something back .
you &apos;re not ?
when you ask questions ,
you &apos;re avoiding answers .
oh , and what did you just do ?
okay .
i &apos;ll show you mine .
you show me yours .
this is gonna require much more liquor .
you first .
i know what woodford is going after .
half ...
a billion in cash .
guess we &apos;re keeping the same secret . there .
everything out in the open .
we &apos;re not done yet .
where were you this morning ?
you really miss that anklet , don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re answering questions with a question again .
he was helping me ...
yes .
with this .
mozzie has created a randomizer .
more importantly , a way to control it .
and now , thanks to moz , we can move the money
to wherever and whenever we want ,
which is why woodford is letting me return
the panthers to their glory years .
a new plan with no guns ?
and in the spirit of full illumination ,
we &apos;d like you to help us design it .
we &apos;ll make it good for woodford .
you make it better for the f.b.i.
you want me to help you plan a new heist ?
our best and final .
so you up for it , suit ?
it won &apos;t work .
then think of something better .
i pitched a better idea two hours ago .
suitcases ?
yeah , all we have to do is get the money to the baggage claim .
two problems -- getting the gang on the tarmac ,
and getting a truckload of cash off .
problems or opportunities ?
he &apos;d be a terrible con .
problems .
there are too many people in baggage claim .
it &apos;s not a safe place to do a takedown .
the entire airport has the same problem .
we need to get the money off campus , then the takedown .
not without attracting security .
cars and trucks will be searched .
this is harder than i thought .
underground .
not bad .
how ?
sewer system .
it &apos;s not exactly elegant .
abandoned subway tunnels .
they don &apos;t run as far as j.f.k ..
yeah .
utility channels don &apos;t have enough elbow room
for men and money .
tubes .
tubes ?
pneumatic tubes .
remember the old bank drive @-@ through ?
put your check in the canister ,
gets sucked in the tube over to the bank .
yeah , and then they send a lollipop back .
the new york postal service
put the first one in operation in 1897 .
by the 1920s , there were vast networks
linking post offices around the city .
yeah , miles of them still exist underground .
they &apos;ve been waiting for us right under j.f.k ..
when it was idlewild ,
all airmail landed there .
hauled to warehouse 17,
where it was loaded into canisters .
when , seconds later , through the tubes ,
it landed in a sorting center right outside the airport .
please tell me the building still exists .
according to internet maps , it does .
it &apos;s the perfect way to get the money
out of the airport without being seen .
peter , you &apos;ve missed your true calling .
oh , there &apos;s still time .
now , the building &apos;s in an industrial area ,
so it &apos;ll be easy for the tac team to isolate .
we can set up a four @-@ block safety perimeter .
when woodford and his gang collect the money , we move in .
perfect .
except for one thing .
if the tubes do exist , they still need
the air compressors that powered them .
and what are the odds they still work after 60 years ?
only one way to find out .
all right , according to the schematics ,
the tubes and the air compressor should be behind the south wall .
oh , i &apos;m under strict doctor &apos;s orders
to avoid all manual labor .
i &apos;m hernia @-@ prone .
you &apos;re the one who insisted on coming .
that &apos;s when i thought all the other panthers
would be here .
i &apos;m not bringing the panthers here
until i know the equipment still exists .
sledgehammers are abhorrent to a man of my finesse .
these hands have never known a blister .
you might want to get in touch with your inner macho .
i never thought i &apos;d quote ronald reagan , but ,
&quot; mr. gorbachev , let &apos;s tear down that wall . &quot;
building and safety . emergency inspection .
for the building or for us ?
and straighten the calves .
90 @-@ degree angle .
swami , we &apos;re on the clock .
okay , yoginis , continue .
if anyone needs any further instruction ,
i &apos;ll be right over here .
they will not need your help .
um , an enlightened instructor is not threatened
by a superior one .
namaste .
go face the wall .
go . take your tools .
look , we &apos;re sorry to disturb you like this .
we suspect there may be asbestos .
asbestos ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
hopefully , it &apos;s just a false alarm .
we &apos;ll check it out and get back to you , okay ?
excuse me .
girls . ladies .
everyone , come on up here .
gonna break it right here .
you ready ?
okay , go ahead .
all right . all right .
well ?
it &apos;s there . all of it .
all right , bad news .
we found asbestos .
this property is off @-@ limits until further notice .
we apologize for any inconvenience .
namaste .
namaste .
it &apos;s time to call in the panthers .
oh , so let me guess .
this is my cue to disappear .
for now , moz .
for now .
okay .
if we get the compressor up and running ,
you and i need to start discussing the next step of the plan .
pneumatic tubes .
brilliant . who knew they even existed ?
i picked the brain of an associate .
the same guy who helped me on the stamp job .
you discussed our plan with someone outside the gang ?
i gave him a hypothetical .
besides , i trust him with my life .
you &apos;ve definitely trusted him with it now .
you sure about all these guys ?
i vetted them myself .
questioned them about the mole .
they &apos;re clear .
i noticed keller isn &apos;t here .
that &apos;s right .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s the mole , do you ?
should i ?
keller &apos;s not a man of stealth or subtlety .
he &apos;s no more a mole than i am .
you need something ?
i want to talk to you inside .
what &apos;s going on ?
you mind telling us what we &apos;re doing here ?
i &apos;m implementing the new plan .
nothing &apos;s wrong with the old plan .
except death .
guns mean body bags for them and us .
i &apos;m willing to die for the gang , but i &apos;d prefer not to .
might be you had other reasons for changing the plan .
like making it better for the people who placed the mole .
you think i &apos;m the mole ?
a man named boothe was set to join us .
he &apos;s vanished , replaced by you .
he failed his audition . i didn &apos;t .
and look at you . already top of the class .
if i were a mole ,
wouldn &apos;t i try to stay in the background ?
maybe keep a lower profile ?
or the opposite .
okay , so i placed a bug in a secret hideout
before i was a member .
i &apos;m even better than i think i am .
do any of you come with that kind of warranty ?
don &apos;t turn this around on us .
who has more to gain ?
multiple police forces were closing in on all of you .
you fled to the u.s. , never to go home again .
now interpol comes calling with immunity and deep cover ?
that &apos;s tempting for all of you but not for me .
i am home .
all of us here are loyal and trusted by woodford .
yeah , including me .
maybe .
the plan requires we get
that air compressor up and running .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s in charge as long as we get that done .
mike , you &apos;re the best alarm guy in the business .
you think you can get power into that room again ?
sergio , is there an engine you can &apos;t fix ?
so far , undefeated .
i like that .
what about your friend keller ?
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know , but if he is the mole ,
he &apos;s not here , so i don &apos;t care .
what &apos;s important is that motor .
these tubes are linked to the airport .
they carry the cash , so we won &apos;t have to .
anybody searches us , we &apos;re clean .
we walk right out
and straight to where the money is waiting for us .
here .
all that cash through tubes ?
it won &apos;t work .
well , we always have your plan to fall back on .
firepower will be our last resort .
sergio , you ready to meet your next opponent ?
i &apos;ve only seen the likes of her in museums .
mike , get me some power in here , would you ?
i &apos;ll check the cables ,
make sure they &apos;re not cut or worn through .
i &apos;ve never seen you eat junk food at work before .
antsy .
pre @-@ sonogram jitters ?
is it normal ?
i put mine off for weeks .
you think you &apos;re worried now , wait till you see the heartbeat .
it gets worse ?
it gets real .
being a parent , worry is a constant companion for life .
no , but it &apos;s a wonderful worry
because you love someone that much .
hey , i found it .
a shipping container yard near the docks .
it &apos;s a match .
excellent . let &apos;s check it out .
neal was spotted there this morning .
doing what ?
well , that &apos;s the $ 1 / 2 @-@ billion question .
neal .
hey , woodford sent his best men to help me
at the yoga studio .
keller isn &apos;t one of them .
woodford must suspect him .
you need to find him now .
if he &apos;s in trouble , you &apos;re in trouble .
he &apos;d have no problem saving his own life at my expense .
caffrey , you &apos;re needed inside .
call me when you can .
all right , luc needs to find keller right now .
damn . voice mail .
i &apos;ll find luc .
track his phone .
tell him we need keller here .
i &apos;m on it .
no lookouts .
no security .
if this is a trap ,
i deserve to step in it .
no trap .
a gesture of loyalty .
when one of my men is incommunicado ,
i tend to worry .
i was working .
solving your mole problem .
i know who it is .
and i know where he is right now .
beautiful .
we got good pressure too .
enough to suck stacks of cash through these tubes ?
think so .
what was that ?
our golden ticket .
stuck for 60 years .
yes , sir .
right .
i &apos;ll have us all there immediately .
woodford said to drop everything .
emergency meeting .
caffrey met the woman here .
gave her an envelope .
suspicious , but that goes for everything caffrey does .
by the time luc got out of his car ,
neal had vanished .
yeah , again , nothing new .
neal never goes anywhere without a purpose .
why here ?
what &apos;s he up to , jones ?
these containers aren &apos;t a bad place
to stash $ 1 / 2 billion in cash .
no , none of them are registered to him , of course .
maybe that &apos;s why he met the woman here .
she rented it out for him .
possible .
let &apos;s start with those over there ,
see if we can narrow it down .
hey , don &apos;t you have that baby thing to do ?
i can handle this .
yeah , our first sonogram .
i still don &apos;t have to meet el for an hour .
you know , i &apos;m excited for you .
i &apos;m pretty excited myself .
yeah .
you want to be a dad ?
oh , i can &apos;t wait .
but in terms of choosing wives , i &apos;m being extra picky .
i want my kids to have the kind of mom i had .
she was a teacher , right ?
yeah , high school math .
pure love with a side of strict .
you know , my life has been guided
by the fear of my mother &apos;s disapproval .
same here .
you know , i feel for your kids .
you and el are a hard act to follow .
well , we &apos;ll have to set a poor example .
take the pressure off .
diana , did you find luc ?
i tracked him to a restaurant
that i swear actually has greasy spoons .
no sign of him .
well , a locater doesn &apos;t lie .
his phone has got to be around there somewhere .
try calling luc &apos;s phone .
diana , what &apos;s wrong ?
diana ?
he &apos;s dead .
his body &apos;s in the dumpster .
what ?
luc &apos;s been killed .
i got to find neal .
what happened , caff ?
gq kick you off the cover ?
sergio got the compressor started .
the tubes still work .
we &apos;re set to go .
there &apos;s more important things to attend to .
i &apos;ve got a mole to exterminate .
thanks to keller , we &apos;re about to find out who that is .
he &apos;s here , standing amongst us ,
and this device is gonna point him out .
very unexpected .
wait , you can &apos;t think it &apos;s me .
woodford , this is crazy .
and yet , this little device says otherwise .
can we make it happen within the next 48 hours ?
there &apos;s still a lot of work to do .
get it done .
you missing something , keller ?
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
you can find it in aubrey &apos;s pocket .
you just got someone killed .
yeah , a wanted killer ,
and i saved the whole operation in the process .
how did woodford gets luc &apos;s tracker ?
ask woodford .
luc is dead ?
i can &apos;t see him just handing it over .
you gave him up .
does it matter ?
not gonna cry over a dead cop .
besides , i like your plan .
it &apos;s gonna make us all rich .
what plan ?
when peter finds out about luc ,
interpol is the first call he &apos;s gonna make .
a united nations of cops will sweep down on manhattan .
then burke is gonna have to convince them to hold back
for the good of the mission .
otherwise , luc-- he died for nothing .
oh , you &apos;ve got this all figured out , huh ?
i &apos;m just trying to do the right thing .
forensics find anything in the dumpster or luc &apos;s body ?
nothing . no fingerprints , no signs of dna .
nothing to link him to woodford ?
so luc was killed someplace else and dumped there .
we don &apos;t even have enough for an arrest warrant .
let alone a conviction .
what about the man he just killed ?
there were five eyewitnesses .
yeah , subpoena us .
four will swear they didn &apos;t see anything ,
and i &apos;ll be facedown in a garbage barge
bound for south carolina .
wow , that &apos;s where new york &apos;s garbage goes ?
one of several places .
i don &apos;t want my body ending up at any of them .
i just got off the phone with deputy director pillar .
he convinced interpol that the only way
to get justice for luc is to go through with the plan .
take the panthers down for the heist .
get someone to finger woodford for a sweeter deal .
and keller ?
he &apos;s mine now .
we &apos;ve got less than 72 hours .
bring up the map .
honey , i &apos;m so sorry . i--
sit .
i know someone died today .
i know it was a law enforcement officer ,
and it &apos;s horrible .
it is , but--
but you didn &apos;t even call .
you didn &apos;t even give me a chance to reschedule the appointment .
our child &apos;s first sonogram , peter .
i just got so wrapped up--
in the case .
the peter burke tunnel vision .
let me make this clear .
i am not going to raise our child
as a married single mother .
no . never .
and he &apos;s gonna be the first priority in this family .
he will . he--
w @-@ wait , he ?
it &apos;s a boy ?
and he &apos;s perfect .
oh , god , el .
it &apos;s a boy .
yeah .
i really need to kiss you right now .
so i &apos;ve already hacked you into their network .
okay .
okay ?
you type in this code first . that overrides their system .
then these numbers , they manipulate the algorithm .
these numbers ?
yeah .
that &apos;s all i have to do ?
yeah .
the arrival time is 3 : 45 p.m. thursday ,
jfk , oceanic flight 1097 .
money should be loaded into warehouse 17
an hour after that .
you &apos;re positive about this ?
neal , this is a precision instrument .
you &apos;re amazing , moz .
i mean , none of this would be possible without you .
and ?
and ?
and now that the panthers are down a mole ,
it &apos;s the perfect time ...
no , no .
woodford just killed his most trusted man .
keller could have stuck that chip on you .
or you .
neal , since we &apos;ve met ,
we &apos;ve always been watching out for each other , so why not now ?
you have to trust me , moz .
i always have , but lately--
no , trust doesn &apos;t have a time limit .
you &apos;ve been lying to me .
holding back information , which is worse .
i have my reasons .
what is this ?
why are you not telling me ?
are you helping the f.b.i , or are you taking the money ?
just be patient for a little longer , okay ?
this is all going down now .
you said you had a bigger plan .
where the hell do i fit in ?
glad you stopped by .
el &apos;s in bed by 7 : 00 now .
gets a little quiet around here .
so how angry was she ?
oh , not as angry as i was at myself .
never again .
the panthers are down a man .
does that affect the plan ?
it could .
we need to replace him with someone we trust .
you have someone in mind ?
let &apos;s get to work , gentlemen .
first , we have a problem to solve .
didn &apos;t i already solve it ?
we already know how long it &apos;s going to take
braxnet security to respond to the alarm .
i &apos;ve calculated how many men we need to load the money
into the tubes in that amount of time .
&apos;cause now we &apos;re a man short .
yeah .
well , on the other hand ,
it &apos;s one less share to load .
i don &apos;t leave money on the table .
i assume you have a solution .
i do .
look who we have here .
you know him ?
our paths have crossed .
more times than i care to remember .
consider the stamp job his audition .
and he &apos;s the mastermind who came up with the tubes .
i &apos;ll decide who auditions , mr. caffrey .
now who the hell are you ?
