gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i want to help you stay on as gossip girl .
i want to protect your identity and help you keep the site .
you &apos;re actually her . you &apos;re gossip girl .
please , whatever you do ,
just don &apos;t tell anyone .
you saved chuck &apos;s life , and you did that because ...
i &apos;m chuck &apos;s mother .
what &apos;d you find out ?
that the first record of our diana payne
was three years ago .
before that , it &apos;s like she didn &apos;t even exist .
so if diana payne &apos;s not her real name ,
how do we ever find out her story ?
if you wanted to see my underwear ,
all you had to do was ask .
i told chuck he doesn &apos;t have my heart anymore .
i realized it belongs to someone else .
elizabeth fisher e @-@ mailed me that picture a few minutes ago .
take a look at the date in the corner .
it &apos;s right before you were born .
take a look at this photo again .
you see the tattoo on the guy &apos;s arm ? check it out .
it &apos;s not who &apos;s my mom . it &apos;s who &apos;s my dad .
nate , i think jack bass is my father .
you know you love me .
they say in life
there are two sides to every story .
but on the upper east , we always have three .
there &apos;s his , hers ...
but the most important
is always mine .
come in .
oh , dorota . you didn &apos;t have to bring me breakfast .
miss serena , you must taste test
my new kreplach .
these bad boys take warsaw faster than red army .
oh , thank you , but do you mind
just setting it down over there for a minute ?
i have to finish what i &apos;m typing .
miss serena , all you do all day is type , type , type .
you take laptop with you everywhere .
it not healthy .
well , after last week &apos;s family meltdown ,
this laptop is the only thing keeping me sane .
writing is my new outlet . you should be happy for me .
if you say so .
but vanya say same thing about &quot; warcraft , &quot;
and then d.s.l. bill come ...
yes , of course everything &apos;s set for tonight .
there is nothing to worry about .
i hope that &apos;s not overconfidence
i hear in your voice .
i don &apos;t need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is .
if anyone finds out ...
jack , they won &apos;t .
chuck and everybody else thinks i &apos;m his bloody mother .
they &apos;re off the scent completely .
what time are your guests arriving ?
um , 9 , i believe .
you know what ? let me just double @-@ check that .
and our cargo ?
hang on .
you know , give me a second ?
i &apos;m gonna have to ring you back .
hey , i was just thinking about you .
were you ? what a coincidence .
yeah , i had fun the other night .
i &apos;m just sorry we didn &apos;t get to have that drink after .
after you rifled through my things and stole my day planner ?
your what ?
come off it , nate .
where is my book ?
diana , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
maybe you left it at work .
maybe your assistant has it ,
but i don &apos;t .
you know what , nate ? i nearly believe you .
but if i can &apos;t find it , i &apos;m coming to see you next .
was that diana ?
yeah , looking for her book .
i played it clueless .
good , because if she &apos;s going to continue to lie to us
and pretend to be my real mother ,
i see no reason why we shouldn &apos;t return the favor .
well , i think i bought us another day or two ,
but not much more . any progress cracking the code ?
none whatsoever . it &apos;s all a jumble of numbers and letters .
do you even know what you &apos;re looking for ?
some link to jack .
his secretary still hasn &apos;t heard from him ?
not in over a month .
she thinks he found love in phuket .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s here .
and if he &apos;s my father like i think he is ,
the only way to get the truth is to find him .
yeah , well , unless you wanna watch &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; again ,
i think we &apos;re gonna need to hire a professional--
you know , someone from the military
or even a serial killer .
it takes a special level of crazy
to go that far to hide your secrets .
i &apos;ll be back in a bit .
any luck ?
nope . serena must &apos;ve changed
&quot; gossip girl &quot; &apos; s username and password
after georgina sent her the laptop .
well , i &apos;m just glad you finally believe me about
serena acting as gossip girl .
and i apologize again for ever having doubted you .
and for calling me a fame @-@ whoring social climber ?
yeah , that , too .
you hungry ?
care to discuss passwords over pancakes ?
mm . how often do you shave ?
what ? i &apos;m just asking .
come on , let me help . i &apos;m very good .
everyone said my waldorfo stole
constance / st. jude &apos;s &quot; sweeney todd &quot; in sixth grade .
uh , i &apos;m already late to meet alessandra in brooklyn .
she &apos;s dying to come over to the loft
&apos;cause i know she wants to read my first chapter .
it &apos;s not done ?
it &apos;s basically done .
what is dan humphrey &apos;s definition of &quot; basically &quot; ?
page 2 .
i &apos;m blocked , all right ? it happens .
all i need is a fiery bolt of inspiration .
that makes two of us .
you know , after my theatrics at the young lions club ,
it &apos;s time to quit my moping and get back in touch
with what it truly means to be the blair waldorf .
that &apos;s right .
o.g.b.-- original gangsta blair .
exactly . i need to find that blair again ,
and what better place to look for her than at the met ,
surrounded by some of my favorite paintings ?
well , you better not meet any princess this time .
you don &apos;t need to worry .
believe me , i &apos;m done with fairy tales .
it &apos;s time to be real again .
lunch later ? we can
compare notes on soul searching .
done . we &apos;re very lucky , you know ?
most couples don &apos;t give each other the freedom we do .
but you and i , we can
spend our days as we please .
and you know why ?
you trust me . i trust you .
i think i just quoted ray j.
i don &apos;t know who that is , but sure .
now be gone .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
i mean , we can &apos;t let serena stay gossip girl .
ah , trust me , i know .
it &apos;s not good for anybody , especially serena .
we just need to figure out how to get her to see that herself .
or we could out her to perez right now .
其博客网站以名人的八卦新闻为主
lola , i know you &apos;re angry ,
but serena &apos;s your sister .
well , technically half . it &apos;s time to take her down .
i bet the real gossip girl would help us .
yeah , well , she &apos;s no picnic either .
i mean , i agree we have to deal with the serena problem .
i &apos;m just not sure now is the best time to do it .
you know , chuck &apos;s searching for the truth about his real father ,
and i &apos;m trying to dig up some dirt on his fake mother diana
so i can force her out of &quot; the spectator . &quot;
well , serena and diana are allies ,
so maybe two birds , one stone .
yeah , well , i guess i could ask the real gossip girl
to help me with serena .
i do still have her number she texted me from .
okay , and i can pay a little visit to serena
and get her to help you out with diana .
oh . there you are . rufus let me in . i hope you don &apos;t mind .
so ... where &apos;s the manuscript ?
i &apos;ll admit , i might have peeked in your office .
well , you know what ? it &apos;s still coming along , but , um ...
dan . i know , you &apos;re blocked .
that &apos;s why i wanted to talk .
look , when artists fall in love ,
their work invariably suffers .
you just need to refocus yourself creatively .
y @-@ yeah , yeah ,
that &apos;s exactly what i was telling blair this morning .
well , luckily for you , i already have the perfect solution .
that &apos;s great . what is it ?
i don &apos;t want to ruin the surprise .
just meet my friend lucia for lunch at the atlantic grill .
let fate take care of the rest .
no , i can &apos;t do lunch . i already made plans with blair .
you &apos;ll wanna cancel them for this .
i promise .
okay .
chuck . i don &apos;t have time for any of your nonsense .
i have a very busy day planned .
blair , listen to me , please . i have this book .
it &apos;s written in code , and i desperately need to crack it .
i remembered how good you are at things like this .
or at least you ... were .
maybe that was the old you .
you know what , bass ? today is your lucky day .
what are you doing here ? i thought i made myself clear .
you know , serena , i don &apos;t know why you hate me so much
when all i &apos;ve ever done is protect you and your secret .
but if that &apos;s the way you &apos;re gonna treat me , then forget it .
wait .
if it &apos;s important , i @-@ i do wanna hear .
you can &apos;t trust diana . i just found out that
she &apos;s working with the real gossip girl to take you down .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;d do something like that , but ...
i do .
diana told me herself that she and gossip girl have a history ,
so gossip girl is probably
using one of the secrets of diana &apos;s past
to blackmail her again .
well , what are you gonna do about it ?
well , if those two are working together ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
you &apos;re gonna think this is crazy , but ...
what if you could find out diana &apos;s secret first ?
how ?
well , nate stole diana &apos;s day planner , and , uh ,
it &apos;s all in code so no one knows what it says .
but why go to that much trouble ?
it seems to me if you break the code ,
you have diana &apos;s secret .
you know , i @-@ i did see diana writing in her planner once ,
and there was a little book next to it .
maybe that other book is the key to the code .
oh , my god . can you get it ?
well , if i do , will--will you help me figure out her secret ?
yes , absolutely .
okay , i &apos;ll head over to diana &apos;s office ,
and i &apos;ll let you know what i find .
他们确实拿了你的本子
你知道该怎么做
be careful , lola .
when you double @-@ cross a double agent ,
there &apos;s always double trouble .
no , it &apos;s not on diana &apos;s desk or in her filing drawer .
ooh . a big ben paperweight .
well , keep looking .
the key to the code has to be somewhere at &quot; the spectator . &quot;
nate said he didn &apos;t see it at her hotel .
i &apos;m doing my best . i &apos;ll call you soon as i leave here , okay ? bye .
bravo , serena .
you &apos;re a better actor than you know .
and to invent a decoder book ? sheer genius .
oh , i have my moments .
i wouldn &apos;t worry too much about nate , though .
your book is clearly useless to him without the key .
all the same , i won &apos;t feel completely reassured
until i get it back .
would you mind fetching it for me ?
don &apos;t you mean stealing it back from my friends ?
that &apos;s going out on quite a limb . what &apos;s in it for me ?
only gossip girl &apos;s cell phone number .
how do you have that ?
i have friends in high places .
think about it , serena .
if you can use this number to track down the real gossip girl ,
i bet you can blackmail her into letting you keep the site .
she &apos;ll quit before she &apos;ll ever risk being exposed ,
and you can stay gossip girl forever .
but how do i know that &apos;s the real number ?
you don &apos;t ,
but you &apos;ll find out when you get me my book back .
apologies . i just needed a few minutes to get into character .
if you wanna think like diana payne ,
you have to become diana payne .
cheers . thanks a lot .
you &apos;re adorable . &quot; spectator . &quot;
regardless of whether we find jack ,
i can &apos;t tell you how glad i am at this moment
that diana isn &apos;t really my mother .
hand me the book .
well ... it &apos;s not classic caesar .
i can tell that just from looking at it .
what is that ?
this is my cipher slide . don &apos;t you have one ?
there was a brief period in the third grade
where i suspected my mother was reading my diary ,
and measures had to be taken .
but this is a vigenere code .
it &apos;s not unbreakable , but it can take a long time ,
especially without software .
we don &apos;t have a long time .
maybe she used something simpler for dates and times .
let me look at the calendar .
look . there .
what ?
on the first saturday of every month at 9 : 00 p.m. ,
there &apos;s an appointment made up of ...
14 or 15 letters .
and they &apos;re each different , but ...
you crack those , you can get the rest .
and look--
this month &apos;s appointment is tonight .
nate was dating diana during some of those saturdays .
well , maybe we can jog his weed @-@ addled mind
into remembering something .
it &apos;s worth a shot . let &apos;s go .
hi . uh , lucia ?
you must be dan . ciao .
it is such a thrill to meet you ?
i am a huge &quot; inside &quot; fan .
i ordered a giant box of copies for our office in rome .
oh , that was you ?
yes . please sit .
so you are adorable ?
thank you .
so since alessandra promised not to spoil the surprise ,
i would like to tell you why i &apos;ve asked you here today .
i would like to cordially invite you to join
this summer &apos;s group of artists in residence
at the italian arts and letters institute in rome .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
梅勒 : 美国作家 记者
is it the arts and letters institute ,
like where--where roth and--and mailer went ?
and don &apos;t forget sontag , delillo ,
ondaatje .
i ,
i don &apos;t know what to say . i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m honored .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i need this right now .
well , perfecto . then it &apos;s settled .
you &apos;ll spend the entire summer at the villa ,
eating , drinking , living , and creating .
the retreat is--is all summer ?
yes , of course .
is there a problem ?
no . well , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t think so .
i need to talk to my girlfriend about this ,
&apos;cause we haven &apos;t discussed our summer plans yet ,
and we probably should decide them together , so--
well , i leave for rome first thing tomorrow ,
so i will need your answer by tonight .
you do realize that there are a lot of young writers
who would jump at this opportunity , daniel .
of course .
okay . so ...
mangiamo .
okay , this is the first time andrew tyler found
any record of a &quot; diana payne &quot; in l.a.
oh , the deed to her house ,
which she bought from ... &quot; simon callow . &quot;
sorry to barge in . i just felt so bad that i struck out .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it . it &apos;s not your fault .
yeah . we &apos;re not really having any luck here , either .
well , i was thinking ,
maybe since i &apos;m the one that saw diana transcribing ,
if i see the day planner again , that may jog my memory .
too bad chuck has it .
looks like we might have a lead ,
thanks to blair &apos;s powers of observation .
but unfortunately , the entire clue trail
hangs by the flimsiest of threads--
nate &apos;s long @-@ term memory .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
hello ?
did you find your inspiration ?
yes . but the only problem is , it &apos;s in rome .
blair , i just got invited
to the institute of arts and letters&apos;
summer artists retreat .
oh , my gosh . that &apos;s incredible !
but what could possibly be the problem ,
besides rome in august ?
well , for starters , i would be gone all summer .
so , you know , being a 21st century boyfriend ,
i thought we should discuss it first .
that &apos;s sweet , but i would never stand in the way
of an opportunity like that . you have to take it .
wait . are you on your phone at the museum ?
oh . no , actually , i &apos;m at the empire .
waldorf , we need you .
just a sec !
oh , is that chuck ?
yes . he asked for my help with a scheme .
you don &apos;t mind , do you ?
scheming is classic blair ,
and i &apos;m getting my groove back just like i wanted .
no , of course . it &apos;s just i-- you know , i i @-@ mean ,
with chuck ?
and serena and nate
and serena light . don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not worried . why would i be worried ?
so--so are you--are you sure i should say &quot; yes &quot; ?
remember what we said this morning ?
we &apos;re good with each other .
we help each other grow , we don &apos;t hold each other back .
i &apos;ll see you later .
yeah , great .
nathaniel , you must remember something diana was doing
that was unusual on those saturdays .
besides you , of course .
guys , i &apos;m looking !
gym . gym . bangs trimmed . gym .
oh , ha ha ha .
look , diana and i barely spent any time outside of the office .
we just never went on any real dates .
and we just were working and ... you know--
o @-@ okay . i think that &apos;s my excuse to leave .
i promise i &apos;ll keep searching
till i find the little black key to diana &apos;s book .
nate , we have tried this the easy way .
oh , my god . the book is gone .
serena !
let &apos;s make sure i &apos;ve got this straight .
blair wants you to go to rome ?
she couldn &apos;t have been happier for me .
and that &apos;s a bad thing why ?
of course i want her to be happy for me ,
just not that happy . i mean , you know ,
she d--she didn &apos;t have to think about it for a second .
dan .
you didn &apos;t hear her--or chuck .
it was--it was like she wanted me to leave
so she could just spend all summer with him .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not the case . she loves you .
i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
you two haven &apos;t ...
i mean , we &apos;re not in high school anymore .
it takes--it takes time , you know .
to feel or to admit ?
that &apos;s not--that &apos;s not the point . this morning ,
it felt like we were-- we were in such a good place .
and i &apos;m sure you will be again
the moment you sit down and actually talk to her .
and you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
i just need to talk to her in person .
are you sure that right now is the best time ?
i mean , when she &apos;s in the middle of ...
s. , i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d go behind our backs like this .
and why are you protecting diana ?
diana told me if i got her book back , then she would
give me gossip girl &apos;s real phone number .
i finally have a chance to see who she really is .
and that &apos;s more important to me
than helping nate kick diana out of &quot; the spectator . &quot;
more important than me finding my father ?
what ?
diana lied to me . she &apos;s not my mother .
and i think she &apos;s covering for my father--
well , my real father jack .
oh , chuck , i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t know .
this book is the only chance i have of tracking jack down .
well , what can i do ?
be with us , not against us .
you have me , 100 % .
great .
let &apos;s get rid of this bitch once and for all .
she &apos;s late . we should call .
well , maybe diana just missed her appointment .
or lola couldn &apos;t bribe the girl she knows at the spa .
you guys should just trust me and stop dithering .
i sent in a seasoned professional .
我到了
she &apos;s in .
i can &apos;t tell you how much my shoulders need this .
treatment about to begin .
just ...
relax .
first ,
i do exfoliation
with japanese sea salt body scrub .
excellent choice .
then wild mint foot rub .
i still don &apos;t know
how you &apos;re gonna massage the code out of her .
watch and learn , archibald .
mmm ! it &apos;s been so long since my last massage .
i know .
why you miss last appointment ?
what ? i didn &apos;t .
my boss want to charge you .
spa have very strict cancellation policy .
but i didn &apos;t book a session .
unless my assistant did . what day was it ?
first saturday last month .
i wasn &apos;t even in the country that weekend .
not that it &apos;s any business of yours ,
but i was actually in europe .
england ?
italy ?
france ?
portugal !
what do we know about portugal ?
they speak portuguese ?
they play pretty good football .
they don &apos;t .
hey , who was that tutor you had in , like , the sixth grade ?
mariana costa .
she was from lisbon .
i spent our lessons trying to get under her saia .
needless to say , i succeeded .
what if all these letters
are just different international phone numbers ?
the code for that night was &quot; k @-@ l @-@ l . &quot;
which is &quot; 5 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 &quot; on the keypad ,
and we all know from watching movies that &apos;s fake .
and you run a newspaper ?
if she had been using a numeric key ,
it could be decoded as &quot; 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 1 , &quot;
then &quot; 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 1 . &quot;
that &apos;s the country code for portugal .
some childhood memories never fade .
b. , did you just do it ?
got it .
thanks , dorota .
now we do complimentary body wrap .
i didn &apos;t order one .
you need . trust . i go get seaweed .
okay , now if i &apos;m right--
and we all know i am--
then this is tonight &apos;s number .
yeah , but who does it call ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
how can i help you ?
yes , i &apos;m interested in the event tonight .
yes , how many ?
three .
three it is . will i need to send a car ?
no , the address will be fine .
the vardin house in briarcliff manor .
see you at 9 : 00 .
does anybody have any idea
what we &apos;re about to get ourselves into ?
not a clue , but hopefully , jack will be there .
yeah , and maybe someone that can tell us
who diana payne really is .
i &apos;m gonna get arthur to pull the car around .
wait . what about diana &apos;s book ?
this is my only chance to find out who gossip girl really is .
i already made a copy .
well , i don &apos;t know why
you &apos;re suddenly so interested in that sad little shut @-@ in ,
but here you go . we don &apos;t need it anymore .
thank you .
晚上不用等我了
hey , follow that limo .
thank you .
oh ! serena , you are a lifesaver !
how did you do it ?
i just asked .
well , i &apos;m indebted to you . oh , wait . no , i &apos;m not ,
because i &apos;ve got something you want--
gossip girl &apos;s real phone number .
use it wisely .
thank you .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m late for a meeting . bye .
here . let me .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
gps &apos;ing gossip girl . how else are we gonna find her ?
what do you mean &quot; we &quot; ?
look , i &apos;m the only person who knows why
you really want gossip girl &apos;s phone number .
even if you think you can figure out who she is ,
you can find a way to keep her site forever .
and why would you help me ?
well , you ever heard the expression
&quot; the devil you know &quot; ?
oh , look . gossip girl &apos;s on the move .
and , uh , my van is just around the corner .
okay , fine , let &apos;s go .
who doesn &apos;t love a road trip ?
我们出发了
just watch your blind spot , kiddies ,
or you &apos;ll wind up blindsided .
excuse me .
whoa . this is not what i was expecting at all .
nate , this is a sex club ?
it &apos;s more of a roving brothel .
my father--well , bart-- belonged .
ah , that &apos;s how you knew the lockbox code .
jack &apos;s here . we just have to find him .
how can you be sure ?
it &apos;s the perfect place
for a degenerate like him to hide in .
it &apos;s also the kind of event he wouldn &apos;t miss for the world .
wouldn &apos;t blame him .
but what on earth does this have to do with diana ?
find out and you &apos;ll have her out of &quot; the spectator &quot; by sunrise .
hi . i &apos;m josephine .
you look like you need a friend .
he has a friend .
then why don &apos;t i show you the bedrooms ?
both of you ?
yeah , let &apos;s-- let &apos;s look around .
hey , what are you guys doing here ?
and why are you dressed as waitresses ?
uh , the bouncer at the door
asked if we were &quot; india &apos;s girls . &quot;
so we just went with it , and then he pointed us
to the dressing room and told us to change .
but full disclosure--
we actually gps &apos;ed gossip girl &apos;s phone ,
and it led us here .
wait . india &apos;s girls ? who &apos;s--who &apos;s india ?
i don &apos;t know . the madame ?
but i bet if we find india ,
we find out how diana fits into all of this .
or we just find gossip girl
and make her tell us diana &apos;s secret .
maybe this place is how they know each other .
wait , wait , wait , there she is .
all right , let &apos;s split up .
we &apos;ll look for india . serena ,
you go find gossip girl . and stay away from diana if you can .
if she even knows that we &apos;re here ...
ugh . this isn &apos;t my first rodeo . thank you .
no , but it &apos;s mine , and it &apos;s awesome .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought you &apos;d love that last room ,
especially the canopy bed .
you look like the type that likes a royal theme .
not anymore .
perhaps we should extend our search to beyond just bedrooms .
uh , yes . any dark , small space will do .
closet , attic , the wine cellar .
we might not have time to see the whole house .
the whole house ? we &apos;d love to .
every room , even the occupied ones .
she likes to watch .
meter &apos;s running , kid .
you getting out or we heading back ?
just--just , uh , just give me a minute , all right ?
yeah .
hey . just checking in .
you and blair talk yet ?
no . no , but we &apos;re about to .
dan , it &apos;s been hours . where are you ?
honestly , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t really know .
but , uh , i went to go talk to her at the empire ,
and then i saw her and chuck leaving together in his limo .
so , um ...
i may have followed them .
may have ?
yeah , listen , something &apos;s going on , dad .
i mean , she--she &apos;s--she &apos;s with chuck inside a huge mansion .
i &apos;m worried about her .
dan , the only person i &apos;m worried about right now is you .
so whatever blair is doing with or without chuck ,
you have to trust her .
if you storm in there and confront her ,
she &apos;ll know for sure you don &apos;t .
let blair have her evening ,
and wait for her to tell you about it .
i &apos;m sure she will if you give her a chance .
hey , man , i think one of your girls slipped something in my drink .
relax , kid , it &apos;s a party .
things happen .
well , i wanna talk to india . where is she ?
upstairs , not seeing visitors .
i understand , but i told you not to worry about nate and lola .
i can handle them .
the important thing is that everything else run smoothly .
i &apos;m gonna call you back .
get me head of security .
well , the dumbwaiter has potential ,
but it might be too cramped .
one of us would have to stand .
b.
what are you doing here ?
looking for gossip girl . it &apos;s a long story .
wait , did you find jack ?
not yet .
okay , well , be careful because diana &apos;s downstairs ,
so if she sees you and chuck ...
i &apos;ll deal with diana . and good luck .
you two go on without me .
i &apos;ll make sure diana doesn &apos;t find out you &apos;re here .
out . everyone out .
what ? wait .
someone tipped the cops off . they &apos;re on their way .
no . no .
let &apos;s go ! party &apos;s over !
police are on their way . time to go .
jack .
hello , chuck .
hello , india .
diana , are you ...
oh , my god .
no .
no , it can &apos;t be .
chuck , i &apos;d love to chat ,
but i &apos;m late for something very important .
you &apos;re not going anywhere until i get some answers .
unfortunately , it &apos;s fairly time @-@ sensitive ,
so if you could please get out of the way ...
diana payne isn &apos;t my mother .
sure she is .
admit it .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been behind the lies all these years .
why do you have to be so melodramatic about everything ?
tell , the truth , jack , for once in your life . it &apos;s time .
that &apos;s your arm around elizabeth .
that photo &apos;s 20 years old . and it could be anyone .
it &apos;s your tattoo . don &apos;t try and tell me otherwise .
you were sleeping with elizabeth , weren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ve slept with so many elizabeths over the years .
i mean , she could be one .
are you my father ? answer me .
you sure you really want to know ?
you ! let &apos;s go .
just a minute .
i said , let &apos;s go .
get him outta here .
what just happened ?
did you tell him ?
tell him what ?
what you &apos;re really hiding here .
give us a moment .
listen , nate ,
whatever you and your sidekick may think you know--
oh , give it up , diana .
india . whatever your name is . it &apos;s over .
and unless you want the whole world to know
you run a high @-@ class prostitution ring ,
you &apos;re gonna walk away from &quot; the spectator &quot; forever .
you &apos;ve disappeared before . it &apos;s time to do it again .
ooh , i &apos;m really scared ,
especially as you don &apos;t have a shred of proof
that i run this joint .
who says i &apos;m not just another customer , like you ?
would you care to look
at a video of you checking out the girls ?
i &apos;m sure &quot; the new york times &quot; would .
i could spitzer you so fast your head would spin .
i think i &apos;ll take my chances with the cops
when they get here .
what cops ?
you don &apos;t really think they &apos;re coming here , do you ?
i was the on who ordered everyone out .
fine . we &apos;ll just have to get gossip girl to do it .
hey , i got your text .
what is this place ?
i have no idea . i &apos;ve never been here before in my life .
it &apos;s diana &apos;s office , and this is her club ,
and we need gossip girl to break the story .
i already knew . don &apos;t worry . but i promise
i won &apos;t tell a soul if you help me out right now , please .
i don &apos;t have my laptop .
it &apos;s in my bag , which is in the dressing room .
but i can try to send a blast from my phone .
hmm , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s weird . it says i &apos;m locked out .
mm . let me try signing in again .
well , while you wait ,
i think i &apos;ll just go off and attend to business .
she seems to be having technical difficulties .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong ,
but i can get my computer right now .
whatever you saw ,
or you think you saw , you can &apos;t tell chuck .
of course i &apos;m going to tell him .
he has a right to know .
and there &apos;s nothing you can do
that will make me change my mind .
this isn &apos;t about me .
do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out ?
you need to go .
you &apos;ve already complicated things enough by being here .
this whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch .
you better hope it still does .
my computer &apos;s gone .
gossip girl . she took it .
what ? how do you know that ?
because we set you up .
after we got the address for tonight ,
i gave it to gossip girl .
and i made sure you followed her cell phone all the way here .
you changed the password on her site ,
so she needed the actual laptop .
i &apos;m just sorry for nate that she grabbed it
before you could send that post about diana .
how could you do this to me ?
do what to you , serena ?
stop you from anonymously attacking innocent people
like me and your friends ?
no , but that &apos;s not true .
the old gossip girl hurt people , but i &apos;m different .
no , you &apos;re not , serena .
just look at what &apos;s happened to you .
you &apos;ve cut yourself off
from everything and everyone that you care about .
it &apos;s not right .
neither is tricking me .
yeah , well , go ahead and blame me ,
but i did this to help you , not to hurt you .
either way , it &apos;s over . the real gossip girl &apos;s back .
for now , but i have her number .
the number you have reached
is disconnected .
nate &apos;s not answering .
probably already left with lola .
have you seen serena ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;m sorry .
you look like you just found out jack bass is your father .
chuck , can we just go , please ?
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
there &apos;s no room for secrets , nor should there be .
whatever it is , you can tell me , blair .
it &apos;s just us here , you and me .
i think ...
once everyone is gone
and it &apos;s quiet ...
you need to go back into that house .
have arthur take you back to the city .
pronto .
lucia ? hi , it &apos;s dan humphrey .
ah , dan . great to hear from you . have you decided ?
i have .
my girlfriend wants me to go ...
ah , fantastic !
i knew a writer such as yourself could not pass
on an opportunity like this .
but , um , i &apos;m saying no .
what ? why ?
well , i can work anywhere ,
but i don &apos;t think my relationship can .
and--and right now
both of those things are very important to me .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , i cannot tell you how sorry i am
that you won &apos;t be joining .
maybe next year .
ciao , daniel .
shouldn &apos;t the boat be here by now ?
i &apos;m sure they just got delayed .
they &apos;ll be here soon .
by the way , the fake raid was a great diversion .
once i saw chuck was here ,
i knew i had to get him out as quickly as possible .
well , it worked .
yeah . when we &apos;re done here tonight ,
we need to discuss a renegotiation of my fee .
it just doubled .
mm . that &apos;s a lot of cash .
silence is expensive . you know that .
hmm . once the boat gets here and safely departs ,
you &apos;ll be taken care of . don &apos;t worry .
is &quot; gossip girl &quot; back up yet ?
not yet .
but as soon as she is ,
i &apos;m going to need her help to tell the world
that diana is our generation &apos;s heidi fleiss .
oh , well , i wouldn &apos;t hold my breath if i were you .
serena said gossip girl &apos;s always known the truth about diana .
so if she &apos;s never run it ,
it &apos;s probably &apos; cause she &apos;d rather lord it over here .
oh , that &apos;s great .
so now the only way to get diana out of &quot; the spectator &quot; is to
run the story on the front page of my own newspaper ?
wait .
why not do that ?
you &apos;re joking , right ?
no , i &apos;m not . i mean ...
at least i think i &apos;m not . what &apos;s the downside ?
you have to at least think about it .
okay .
as long as you stay here and think about it with me .
miss serena .
you scare me half to death .
oh . sorry .
why you eat berries in dark ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i just forgot to eat dinner tonight .
where is your computer ? i @-@ i go get it .
no , that laptop belonged to someone else ,
and she took it back , so ...
then we go to best buy , get a new one .
you feel better , in control again .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s possible anymore .
gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite
spotted--blair waldorf
headed back to brooklyn .
haven &apos;t we paid the toll enough for that relationship ?
i was just , uh , just about given up on you .
how was your day of scheming ?
you &apos;re upset with me , aren &apos;t you ?
no , of course not . i &apos;m not upset with you .
i &apos;m upset with the woman from the institute .
she , uh , apparently found somebody that they wanted more .
oh , no . how is that possible ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but it means you &apos;re stuck with me all summer .
well , i &apos;m sorry to hear that ,
but i &apos;m not that sorry .
i &apos;m starving . why don &apos;t we go grab a bite at kellogg &apos;s ?
and i &apos;ll tell you all about my night
and the crazy brothel we ended up at .
a brothel ? you ended up at a brothel ?
i &apos;ll tell you all about it over dinner .
i love you . you know that , right ?
i do now .
come on . let &apos;s go .
of course ,
everybody knows that on the upper east side ,
nothing lasts forever .
and when one door closes ...
another one always opens .
the only question is ,
who &apos;s waiting behind it ?
dad .
