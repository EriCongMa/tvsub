So, Dad's gonna pick you up after the party
and take you to hockey.
He's got your equipment in the car, so...
Michael.
Michael, are you listening?
Yes. Hockey.
Dad has the equipment.
Two slices of pizza.
That's the limit.
Okay. Can I go?
Yes.
Okay.
"Lord of the Flies."
Punch?
Excuse me?
Would you like some punch?
Strawberry, I think.
James. I'm Baxter's uncle.
Oh. Sorry.
Karen.
Crazy, right?
All that energy.
They're like puppies.
With laundry.
Right.
Would you like a slice of cake?
I'm actually late
to pick up my other puppy from piano, so...
But thank you for the punch, though.
Sure.
Karen?
Karen?
Can you hear me?
Where am I?
What happened?
You were drugged.
Phenobarbital.
What are you feeling, Karen?
Can you tell me?
My head...hurts.
How did I get here?
Am I gonna be okay?
No, Karen.
You are not going to be okay at all.
Who are you?
Where am I?
Wait. W-w-what's happening to me?
Where am I?
Quite a chart here, Karen.
Quite a chart, indeed.
Where am I?!
We are going to start
by collapsing your left lung.
No!
Now, there's going to be a sharp pain...
No.
Followed by an involuntary cough
causing a shortness of breath.
Please, please.
I don't even know --
Once the lung fills with blood...
No.
We're going to move along the collarbone --
More specifically the medial end of the left clavicle.
It will cause severe pain.
No.
Well...
Let's get started.
No.
911. What's your emergency?
I've done it again.
Sir?
Sir?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
第一季 第十一集
You know there's a, uh, surveillance van
parked outside all night?
Everyone at the post office is under mandatory surveillance
till they identify the leak.
You make it sound like they're here to protect us.
They are.
So, I applied for a job in Lincoln.
Before you throw that coffee cup at me,
just hear me out.
Okay? There are great schools.
There is low crime.
There's an FBI field office.
I just want to be a normal, boring couple --
No hidden cameras, no fake passports,
no surveillance vans outside.
So do I.
But not in Nebraska.
Well, they asked me to fly out for an interview.
Hang on. You're leaving?
Well, the interview's tomorrow,
so I'm flying out this afternoon.
We need to talk about us, but --
好心的撒玛利亚人
My God.
What is it?
You're positive it's him?
Same surgical precision, same call to 911.
This is the guy.
Mobile psych can handle it.
I rode lead on this case.
That's why they're requesting a liaison.
Our only job right now is finding Raymond Reddington.
This case is important to me.
It's personal.
If it's personal to me, it's personal to Reddington.
He may reach out, try to help...
Make this his case.
OPR is ready.
In the last three weeks,
have you had contact with Reddington?
No.
Tell me this, Agent Keen --
is your husband cleared
to know the location of this black site?
No.
And yet you brought him here.
As part of an investigation.
What investigation?
You can look into that.
All the information is here.
Are you refusing to answer?
Yes.
What happened in that box with Reddington?
He saved my life and then threatened to kill me.
What he said while doing that is none of your business.
According to the report from your therapist,
you feel guilty about what happened during the raid.
Of course I do. I shot a man.
I thought what I said in therapy was confidential.
You shot a terrorist.
Why would you feel guilty about that?
Because he's human.
I'll ask again.
Let's just assume I'm your mole.
Do you really believe a little chitchat here
is gonna get you anywhere?
You're suggesting --
Controlled fear, hypothermia, sleep deprivation.
Do the words "Advanced Interrogation"
not mean anything to you?
Where were you when the site was taken?
I was on my way here.
I was late.
She's a suspect, Harold. They all are.
Yes. And we're turning their lives inside out.
Every bank loan, ATM withdrawal --
Putting Keen on the street is a mistake.
Keen is our best shot at drawing him out.
O.D.N.I. wants to know how a U.S. black site
less than 5 miles from Capitol Hill was compromised.
We have problems, Harold.
You can't even account for all the victims.
Security cameras knocked out --
You lost a body.
How is that even possible?
We don't know.
We think Reddington had something to do with it.
Tell me, our guy --
what do you got on the victims?
Seven so far.
All different ages, incomes.
He always acted unpredictably.
We could never figure out his trigger,
only that he's trying to make a statement.
What kind of a statement?
He never kills his victims.
He always calls 911,
allows first responders a chance to save their lives.
That's why the papers call him
The Good Samaritan.
What's happened?
Are you sure it's my wife?
That's what we need you to confirm for us, sir.
I'm sorry.
What's your boy's name?
Michael.
Why don't you take Mr. Brodine inside here?
And I'll hang out with Michael. If that's okay with you.
Yeah.
How are you doing?
My name's Don.
My dad in trouble?
I don't know.
He steal a car?
No.
Did he rob a bank?
He's a bookie.
What happened to your leg?
Oh, I tripped playing soccer.
I broke my collarbone.
Ooh! Bet that hurt.
When's my dad coming back?
Arrange transport of her ashes personally.
I want it done properly.
♬And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder♬
♬one of the four beasts saying, 'come and see.'♬
♬And I saw, and behold a white horse.♬
♬There's a man goin' 'round takin' names♬
♬And he decides who to free and who to blame♬
♬Everybody won't be treated all the same♬
♬There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down♬
♬When the man comes around♬
♬The hairs on your arms will stand up♬
The hell are you looking at?
I want you to tell me about your friend --
♬At the terror in each sip and each sup♬
The man with the apple.
♬Will you partake of that last offered cup?♬
I don't know. We never met before the job.
♬Or disappear into the potter's ground♬
I swear. I didn't even know his name.
How did you communicate?
By the phones. Everything was anonymous.
Nobody knew anybody.
♬When the man comes around.♬
We all had jobs.
♬Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers♬
♬100 million angels singin'♬
♬Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum♬
Tell me about these jobs.
I've never worked with any of these people before.
I was told to be on standby for a 48-hour window.
♬Voices callin', voices cryin'♬
They said I had under four minutes...
...to pull a chip from your neck.
♬Some are born, and some are dyin'♬
Who told you you had four minutes?
The people who paid me.
♬It's alpha and omega's kingdom come♬
How were you paid?
Cash, at a drop.
Where?
♬And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree♬
It was always a different place, different locations.
They picked me up in an ambulance.
♬It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks♬
I didn't even know where we were going.
♬Till armageddon, no shalam, no shalom♬
So, you had no knowledge
of either the location or a target?
♬Then the father hen will call his chickens home♬
No. I'm surprised it was you.
♬The wise man will bow down before the throne♬
I was just hired to supply the injections
and monitor your vital signs.
How were you paid?
♬And at his feet, they'll cast their golden crowns♬
In cash at the site.
What denomination were the bills?
He paid in $5s and $10s.
♬When the man comes around♬
Nothing larger than a $20.
♬Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still♬
I've told you everything, I promise.
I know you have.
♬Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still♬
You have such a pretty face.
And a paramedic.
♬Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still♬
What a shame.
♬Listen to the words long written down♬
♬When the man comes around♬
♬And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts.♬
♬And I looked, and behold a pale horse,♬
and his name that sat on him was death,♬
♬and hell followed with him.♬
Hello?
Lizzy.
Where are you?
I read about that poor woman they found in Albany.
Sounded awfully familiar.
The Good Samaritan.
Are you back on the case, I hope?
They're going to find you.
This one's important to you, isn't he?
Why? What on earth happened?
I only ask on the chance that I may be able to help.
One of the earliest victims --
she died in my arms.
There was nothing I could do to stop it.
You missed something, didn't you?
Serial killers escalate.
This one doesn't.
The victims and methods vary.
I could never see the pattern...
The profile.
Still can't.
I don't know about serial killers,
but I do know about torture,
and there is no one-size-fits-all.
If you really want to hurt someone,
you need to tailor your attack specifically to that person.
Perhaps the killer's methods, the injuries he inflicts
tell you less about him and more about his victims.
I got to go.
Wait.
I think I've got something.
You've spoken with Reddington.
Yes. He called.
He called when? Did you tell Cooper?
Not yet. We talked about the case.
We're all under suspicion here.
He called, and you didn't report it?
I will, but something he said about the case --
We've been focused on the killer.
We should be focused on the victims.
The most recent victim's son, Michael,
broke his collarbone.
Yeah. He told me at the morgue.
I looked through his medical records.
He broke a lot more than that --
broken ribs, collapsed lung,
blunt trauma to the liver and kidneys.
The boy was abused.
These are the autopsy X-rays
of the most recent victim.
Every fracture, every injury the son had,
the killer gave to the mother.
We should bring the boy in.
Malik.
Alone.
You've been officially cleared.
That took long enough.
We still have some doubts about the others.
We've been monitoring a variety of offshore accounts
linked to Garrick's team.
Contact the banks.
Subpoena them if necessary.
I want to know whose name is on what account
and where that money came from.
I'm counting on your discretion.
I think you should know
Reddington reached out to Agent Keen.
And said what exactly?
She won't say.
Hello, Fyodor.
Okay! Cool out!
I can make this right! Just talk to me!
Oh, yes, Fyodor.
We're gonna talk, all right.
Honestly, I don't understand you, Fyodor.
With all the business you do,
and you're still funneling the money
through your nightclubs, paying contracts in 5s and 10s
'cause you're too cheap to pay the commission
for clean cash.
Anyway, I get sidetracked.
I've come for your banker.
Who is the banker?
I can't...
The first time I ever smoked a cigar
was with Marnie Petersen in fifth grade.
Funny, little, bat-faced girl.
I adored her.
Red...
The bank.
Please.
How about I make this as simple as possible?
There are five bankers on the east coast
who were capable of financing a mission like Garrick's.
I run money through four of them.
Which one?
Okay! Oh, okay!
The money was wired from Gestalten Landesbank,
the New York office.
We have a man there.
I swear that's all I know!
Thank you.
Okay. So -- so that's it? We're finished?
Yes, we're finished.
Oh, my God.
The suspense is killing me.
I don't like to talk about that.
I know, Mike. I know.
We really need to, okay?
You're not in trouble.
I promise.
So, you broke your arm and your wrist?
I fell...off my bike.
And last year, you broke your collarbone
and, uh, broke your ankle?
They were accidents.
That's all I'm supposed to say.
Who told you to say that?
It's okay, Michael.
Tell him what you told me.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.
My mom.
Michael's mother was abusing him for years,
and now she ends up dead.
The same injuries she inflicted on Michael.
Normally, the father would be the prime suspect,
but that doesn't fit.
I mean, even if he wanted to hurt her
for abusing their son,
what about the other victims?
Unless...
it's the same motive.
Our unsub's somebody who targets the abusers.
Like a vigilante killer.
Let's run background checks.
We need to know what other victims
have loved ones with identical injuries.
Beautiful. See, mother?
Some things do remain the same.
I have to go to work now.
Yes, I know.
I don't want to leave you either.
But I promise I'll be home soon.
Mrs. Wilkinson, you have had quite a year.
Three trips to the E.R. in the past 10 months.
Detached retina, concussion,
fractured jaw, and now a broken wrist.
You can see all that?
In your file.
I'm a total space cadet.
I guess I should try to be more careful.
I guess so.
Henry.
What the hell are you...
My wife will be down here any minute.
Great. I'd love to meet the wife.
Mr. Reddington, we have a dinner engagement.
Don't you think it's best you and I
make an appointment for another time?
There's been a nasty bit of business --
blood spilled, lives lost...
a modicum of torture.
Words don't fully describe.
I know who's responsible.
I know who carried it out.
Mr. Reddington, I have no idea --
I've tied up all the loose ends but one.
To finish the job,
I'll need all your wire and transfer records
pertaining to the operation.
Mr. Reddington, I have no --
Please, Henry. Stop.
You were the bank.
Henry...
You were the bank.
This puts me in a real...situation.
Listen. I'll do anything I can to help.
I'll need time to --
You'll hear from me tomorrow.
You need to see this.
One of the offshore accounts was used to launder money
from Gestalten Landesbank into this dummy account in Manhattan.
Louis Coogan.
That's our mole?
Well, that's his alias. Turn the page.
Bring him in.
Clear!
Clear.
He's not here.
Find him now.
Hello, Aram.
What -- what is this?
Where am I?
You're going to do something for me.
Account numbers, routing information.
You're going to steal $5 million from that account
and place it into one of mine.
I expect the transaction to be untraceable.
What?
I can't.
Aram...
This is a Colt .45.1911.
I can strip and reassemble this weapon
in well under two minutes.
Mr. Reddington, please.
Once I have it reassembled, I'm gonna reload the mag,
and if at that time, your task remains incomplete,
I'm gonna empty that mag into your head.
That's really messed up.
Don't look so stricken.
The first shot will kill you.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I did it. It's done. Look.
It's untraceable, like you asked.
How? Explain.
I used a Ripple Exchange to have the fiat currency
converted to e-cash and then into bitcoin.
I ran the whole transaction through a randomized
cryptographic extension at the protocol level,
then through a two-tiered secure laundry service
I know I can trust.
No one's gonna catch you.
I promise.
A souvenir.
You're innocent.
I am?
I mean...I am.
Wait. Of what?
The team that broke into the black site
was paid through Gestalten Landesbank.
My contact there traced a $250,000 payment
to a covert account belonging to Louis Coogan.
Louis who?
It's an alias, for you.
Someone is attempting to implicate you as a mole
by creating a money trail that leads directly to you.
You're obviously far too clever
to have accepted payment that was so easily traceable.
You're not gonna kill me.
No.
I'm going to find somebody else,
and I'm going to kill them.
I never want to hurt her.
I just...
There's this anger that takes over.
It's like I'm someone else, you know?
And we all know that powerless feeling,
but it's our addiction to power and control
that leads to domestic violence.
I'd like to share something.
First time here.
My name is Victor.
Hello, Victor.
I was a victim.
My mother.
She called it tough love.
It was abuse.
I refused to see her for nearly 10 years,
till I realized avoiding her
and pretending those things never happened...
Took a long time.
But I figured out a way to reconcile with her.
It has been hard on both of us,
but we've worked out a process.
Call it a home remedy...
...that has allowed us to move forward.
And now... we're closer than we've ever been.
What you said in group really meant a lot to me.
I understand.
I'm, uh, George, by the way.
I know.
Henry?
I'm so glad you're home. We have company.
You never told me you're rowed crew for Dartmouth.
Don't worry, Henry.
I haven't told her all our war stories.
Well, a few.
You have a lovely wife.
We've been getting to know each other.
Come here, you old such and such.
I know what you've done.
I invited Bernard to stay for dinner.
I have a stroganoff on the burner.
I hope you don't mind if I stay.
I do love stroganoff.
Let me wash up.
You're fun.
He's here.
No! Here in my house.
Wait.
I'm gonna call the police.
Just get somebody here.
Get a car here as soon as you can.
Would you like rice or noodles, Bernard?
Whichever is faster.
I believe the police are on their way.
I gave you what you asked for.
No, Henry.
You gave me the bank transfers pointing to a patsy.
What's he talking about?
Janice, shh.
You should never have come here into my home.
They're on their way.
Nearly everyone has been accounted for, except one.
Who else got paid?
Red, please.
They will kill me if I say a word about any of --
God!
What on earth?!
Who else got paid?
Henry!
You monster! What have you done?!
Please, Janice. Stop with the yelling.
It's just a flesh wound.
He shot you!
The next bullet goes in your stomach
if you don't start talking.
I want a name.
I have to call an ambulance.
Janice, if you don't stop,
He needs a doctor!
I'm gonna put you in the closet.
Red, please.
I need to call Dr. Wright.
He will come to the house!
No doctor --
What are you doing?! Stop it!
Aah! No!
Henry, give me the name.
Let me out of here!
Janice... if you don't stop your yammering,
I'm gonna have to shoot through this door,
which will be a shame,
because I won't have any idea what I'm shooting at.
Give me a name, Henry,
or I'm gonna drag you out, throw you in the trunk,
fly you to Papua New Guinea,
and have your head stuck on a pole.
Newton Phillips.
Janice, my sincerest apologies.
I'll take a rain check on the stroganoff.
It smells delicious.
A saw is an important piece of equipment
in this winter activity.
Mother, we have another guest.
Neal. What is ice fishing?
Correct.
Fishing for $800.
I know what you're thinking.
Don't worry.
We'll be done in time for supper.
Mother...
...this is George Wilkinson.
George is married to a lovely woman
by the name of Melissa.
George, this is my mother, Louise.
Every one of the Good Samaritan's victims
had a family member with identical injuries --
fractured skulls, broken bones, torn retinas.
All of them either the victim's spouse or child.
All of them classic signs of physical abuse.
You think your serial killer
only targets people who hurt others?
How else do you explain this?
Every one of these family members was at a different hospital,
different insurance, different doctors.
There's nothing that ties them together.
Yes, there is.
Nurse Karl Hoffman.
He was on call every time one of the family members
was brought into the E.R.
He's a locum tenens.
He fills in for short-staffed hospitals,
like a substitute teacher.
We're getting warrants for his home address
and the last hospital he reported to.
Good. Get moving.
Hoffman's not here.
He wrapped up his shift at 4:00.
What did you find on your end?
Nothing at his residence either.
I already pulled the medical records
of all the patients he saw on his last shift.
You think he's already identified his next victim?
I sure as hell hope not.
Okay. So, you wanted a list
of all the patients Hoffman saw today?
Yeah, specifically ones who came in with broken bones.
Right.
Well, there's only one patient that fit that description --
Melissa Wilkinson.
She had a fractured wrist.
I think she came in with her husband.
Okay.
April 9, 2011.
Torn retina, left eye.
How did you do that, George? Hmm?
Blow to the head?
Accidental push down the stairs?
See, I like to replicate the experience as best I can.
Oh, well. No matter.
I have plenty of tools
that will achieve the same effect.
See, George, I suffered my share of pain...
...as a child
Courtesy of the one person in this world
who was supposed to protect me.
I found it...
inconceivable
that a person could hurt someone
who they claim to love --
and not just hurt,
but torture...
repeatedly.
But then, one day,
I realized she wasn't experiencing pain.
It was the opposite.
She was actually experiencing pleasure.
See, George...
I believe that the only way that an abuser
can truly understand the experience of the victim
is to have that experience themselves.
And that's what you're doing here today, George.
And that's what mother is here today for, too --
so she never forgets
what I experienced all those years.
And now you will never forget
what your wife experienced all those years.
Is George in some kind of trouble?
Melissa, I need to ask you a difficult question.
Has your husband been abusing you?
No.
Of course not.
I'm aware of your visit to the E.R.
You've been interviewed by a caseworker in the past.
We've had some problems.
Every marriage does.
But he's getting help.
He's been going to group classes at the church twice a week.
In fact, he went today.
He was here for the meeting.
Did he seem to be in any kind of distress?
Not that I could tell.
Was he with anyone?
No. He always comes alone.
Actually, come to think of it, though,
he was chatting with a new member after the session.
New member?
Is this the man he was with?
Yeah. He introduced himself to the group,
told us his story.
Told us about his mother, the abuse.
Thank you.
He's taking back control
in the place where it was taken away from him --
His childhood home.
Okay. Let's see.
What's next?
A concussion.
Do you know what a concussion technically is, George?
It is a blow
with significant enough blunt force
that it literally causes the brain
to rattle around inside of your skull.
This won't do,
'cause there was also a vertical laceration
along with the concussion.
What did you do, George?
What did you throw at her?
A bottle!
A bottle of beer!
What's that, George?
A bottle of beer!
A bottle of beer!
Of course it was.
Keep an eye on him, mother.
I need to run to the kitchen.
I'm afraid we've run out of time, mother.
We're going to have to expedite the procedure.
Step away from him!
Why should I?
Do you have any idea what this man has done?
This man is a monster!
That may be, but killing him
isn't gonna solve anything.
Tell that to his wife.
We don't have the luxury of your simple morality.
Talk to me when you've been a victim.
Drop the hammer!
One more body isn't gonna make a difference.
I think it will...
especially if it's the right body.
Agent Keen.
Mrs. Wilkinson, I'm gonna need to speak with your husband alone for a moment.
Of course.
Actually, wait.
Metro P.D. is looking into charges against you,
but without Melissa's cooperation,
I don't know what will stick.
What I do know is this --
if you ever touch her again...
if you so much as look at her sideways,
I will find you.
And I will do to you myself
what I probably should have let Karl Hoffman
do to you in that garage.
Do you understand?
He surrendered himself in the parking lot.
He's unarmed.
Before I call OPR, let's hear it.
It's from Mr. Reddington.
It's evidence.
Reddington reached out to you?
Well, yes. He...
Uh, yes.
Uh, we had a chat -- at gunpoint, actually.
Long story long, he identified the leak.
Who the hell is Newton Phillips?
♬What would you do?♬
♬If it all came back to you?♬
♬Each crest of each wave♬
♬Bright as lightning♬
♬What would you say♬
Newton.
♬If you had to leave today?♬
♬Leave everything behind♬
♬Even though, for once, you're shining.♬
So...
it's finished?
♬Standing on higher ground♬
If you had come to me, I could have helped you.
♬When you hear the sounds, you realize it's just the wind?♬
We could have avoided all of this.
♬And you notice it matters♬
♬Who and what you let under your skin?♬
But now we can't.
♬If put to the test♬
♬Would you step back from the line of fire?♬
They threatened my family.
Of course they did.
Newton, I'll take care of your family...
♬Hold everything back,all emotion set aside it♬
whatever they need.
My wife...
She has no idea.
♬Convince yourself♬
If you could make it look like an accident, for her.
♬Someone else hide from the world♬
♬Your lack of confidence,what you choose to believe in♬
Look out at the water.
♬takes you much too far♬
Just look out at the water.
♬takes you much too far♬
♬No one else around you♬
♬No one to understand you♬
♬No one to hear your calls♬
♬Look through all your dark corners♬
♬When you're backed up against the wall?♬
♬Step back from the line of fire♬
The assassination attempt failed.
Our asset survived.- What asset?
You still haven't given us a name.
What I can confirm is that the person responsible
for the breach of security has been eliminated.
And who was that?
In accordance with NSPD --
Cut the crap, Diane.
The senate subcommittee briefing is in under an hour,
and I am not walking into congress without the name of that mole.
Well, that's too bad, because I'm not giving it to you.
To do so would compromise the identity of our asset.
What I can tell you is that this particular threat
to our national security died with him.
Based on what?
Your word? Scout's honor?
For all we know, your asset is the threat to national security,
and the effort to eliminate him was the work of a patriot.
I can assure you it wasn't.
And I can assure you that your assurances
make you sound incredibly naive.
Thank you for coming back.
I don't want to fight, Tom. Let's just talk.
Tom's at the airport.
What the hell are you doing here?
How did things go with your case?
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.
Does this mean you're back?
I don't know.
My house is clean.
But yours...
is not.
