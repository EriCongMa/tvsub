so i go into the bathroom with tom ,
and we both , you know ... take &apos; em out .
and i say , &quot; size more ? try size less . &quot;
i wanna go to rehab and compare penises with famous people .
all i could done , kiddo .
well , uh , pierce , we &apos;re very glad to have you back .
i &apos;m assuming . you ?
so ... what should we do now ?
well , i don &apos;t wanna be that guy ,
but i guess we should start studying anthropology .
okay .
okay . um ...
chapter four .
hello !
oh , thank god !
yes !
oh , my god .
thank you .
what is it , dean ?
oh , haha . i have exciting news .
vice president joe biden
has been visiting community colleges across the country
as part of his &quot; biden time talkin &apos; &apos; bout teachin &apos; &quot; tour .
mm , folksy , yet progressive .
he does walk that line .
anyway , his tour is taking him to this neck of the woods ,
in 5 : 00 p.m. today , he is stopping by greendale !
eat that , city college and wash it down
with a nice tall glass of suck it .
the vice president is coming .
that explains the people i &apos;ve noticed
covertly surveilling the campus this week .
must be secret service .
oh , abed , will your reality ever come out on blu @-@ ray
so we can enjoy it ?
we &apos;ve been made .
only problem : mr. biden is supposed to be meeting
with the dean ...
and the head of our student government ,
which in its current form doesn &apos;t exist .
so we have seven hours to elect a student president .
ah , what am i gonna wear ?
i mean , i could borrow my sister &apos;s uncle sam outfit .
it &apos;s tailored for ladies
but what else can i do on such short notice ?
well , you can not dress up like uncle sam .
or admit you don &apos;t have a sister .
we &apos;re electing a student president .
i wanna run !
i have so many ideas for improving the school .
improving greendale takes more than ideas , annie .
it takes time , gasoline , matches .
mm , nice .
well , news flash , jeff . some of us care about more
than just fixing our hair and sculpting our abs .
wow . you got me pegged .
democracy . what a ruse .
there &apos;s no such thing as a system in which
the masses hold any--
everyone wants you to shut up .
and yet i won &apos;t . case in point .
第二季 第十七集
we tend to take democracy for granted in america .
but the fact is men have fought and died
for the sacred right we exercise today .
so anyone who wants to be president ,
line up by the ice cream machine .
your applause will determine who gets into the primaries .
and yes , this is a ladies uncle sam outfit .
it &apos;s my sister &apos;s . it was last @-@ minute .
i had no choice .
i wonder if that &apos;s the same sister that tweets me
to ask if i think her brother &apos;s cute .
jeff , what happened to
that pile of campaign fliers i gave you ?
i hung &apos; em all up .
real nice .
is it too much to ask you to pitch in ?
i &apos;m sorry , annie . i &apos;m not the worker bee type .
i &apos;m more of a silverback gorilla with the claws a lion ,
the teeth of a shark , and the quiet dignity of a tortoise .
all right . first up is this fella .
let &apos;s go . come on .
all right , tell everybody your name .
garrett .
okay , garrett .
and why do you want to be president ?
i wanted ice cream , so i got in line--
okay , okay . he wanted ice cream .
so what do we say , gang ?
does he make it to the next round ?
by applause .
oh ! we &apos;ve got our first nominee .
all right , the bar has been set .
all right , stand to the side . stand to the side .
you know what ?
at least worker bees can set aside their egos
and join together to support a larger cause .
oh , right , because politics are all about larger causes .
face it , annie .
politics are all about ego ,
popularity , and parlor tricks .
don &apos;t kid a lawyer .
well , if i see one , i won &apos;t .
oh , it &apos;s a girl ! look at this .
she &apos;s got a yellow shirt and a hat .
who are you , sweetie ?
uh , vicki .
who &apos;s up for some vicki , huh ?
abed nadir , i &apos;m special agent robin vohlers .
this is special agent keenlan
of the united states secret service .
will you submit to a search of your personal belongings ?
sure .
if i may ask , how did you notice
the campus was being observed ?
i guess i noticed because i &apos;m used to being the only observer .
well , we &apos;re not used to being noticed .
that sounds a little sad .
he &apos;s clean .
although i could issue a warning
for this bootleg of the last airbender .
where were you a week ago ?
you can keep it .
well , another one makes the cut .
congratulations , leonard .
oh , yes , wonderful .
next up , annie edison .
my name is annie edison .
and if elected , i promise to make greendale
the signature community college of the entire western
3 / 4 of the greendale area .
annie !
oh , whoa ! looks like you &apos;re in the running , annie .
looks like it is hard not to be . next up--
i &apos;m sorry . hey , i got the heat , i gotta go .
i believe that humankind need not be governed .
i don &apos;t care .
well , it &apos;s good to know there &apos;s a floor on this thing .
thank you , miss perry .
oh , annie , i &apos;m so proud of you .
people love you .
i believe this campus is a good place ,
filled with good people who just need someone
to protect their interests .
jeff winger !
my name is jeff . i &apos;m no politician .
i &apos;m just a fella .
i think that beer should be cold
and boots should be dusty .
i think 9 / 11 was bad .
and freedom , well ,
i think that &apos;s just a little bit better .
the countdown has begun .
and fight tonight , one student will be president
while the rest will simply be .
for greendale campus tv , i &apos;m abed nadir .
i &apos;m troy &quot; butt soup &quot; barnes .
what ? that &apos;s my name .
as we head into the first round of the debates ,
there are eight candidates in the lead .

girl--you know , you gotta ask yourself right now , abed .
what &apos;s up with politics ?
yeah , yeah .
you &apos;re precisely right , troy .
you know , i hear they &apos;re getting ready to start ,
so we &apos;ll turn it over to coverage of the debates .
who &apos;s that ?
special agent vohlers . united states secret service .
do you just constantly have your own little side adventures ?
yep .
me too .
jeff , knock it off .
you &apos;re not running sincerely .
you &apos;re not even interested in student government .
i know , and yet , the people love me .
it &apos;s almost as if politics were a huge joke .
okay , look .
i &apos;m sorry i asked you to hang my fliers ,
but i suggest you drop out right now ,
because not only will i beat you ,
i will make you cry .
oh , i feel a slight ego
blowing in from the east .
you &apos;re gonna feel my foot blowing in from the south .
bring it on , ponce de leon .
i &apos;m gonna , greg muldunna .

hey , vicki .
vicki , look at me . psst !
i &apos;m going to crush you .
pierce !
stop that !
i &apos;m gonna eat your brains , vicki .
i &apos;m gonna slurp &apos; em right out of that melon
you call a head .
a reminder to all candidates :
your microphones are currently on .
well , they better be , &apos; cause i &apos;m on fire up here .
you freak people out , you know that ?
you look weird ...
because of your overbite .
okay , let &apos;s just get started .
welcome to the greendale community college
presidential debate .
candidates , if elected ,
what will you do ?
oh , annie ?
i &apos;m running on a platform of school improvement .
if i &apos;m elected , the black mold
will be removed from the east stairwell .
the assailant known only as
&quot; the asscrack bandit &quot; will be brought to justice .
and i will balance the school &apos;s budget
by eliminating administrative redundancies .
okay . i &apos;m in the room .
thank you , miss edison .
mr. winger ?
well , that &apos;s an important question .
and it &apos;s important to students like jeremy ,
who told me today that he is majoring in astronomy
and is supporting two children .
it &apos;s an important question to maria ,
who &apos;s a beautiful latina born in nicaragua ,
working in the cafeteria .
what will i do , dean ?
well , these people don &apos;t want me to say what i &apos;ll do .
they want me to do what i &apos;ll say .
they love it when you shuffle the words around .
magnitude ?
pop ! pop !
oh , no !
same question .
same answer .
pop ! pop !
mind if i ask you a few questions , mr. nadir ?
okay .
was there a specific reason you had to repeat the first grade ?
well , from what i &apos;m told ,
i didn &apos;t know how to use scissors ,
i sat in the middle of the seesaw ,
and i always found the distinction
between duck and goose to be very arbitrary .
couldn &apos;t you just pick the sixth kid every time ?
that &apos;s what i ...
would have done .
i went with four .
geez , get a room , you two .
pierce hawthorne , your platform ?
my platform will be one high enough
to push vicki off to her death .
vicki !
it looks like vicki is out of the race .
oh , well , then i am too .
i was only here to get back at her
for not lending me a pencil .
okay . wow .
uh , well ...
can we get back on track here ?
i just want to get the black mold
out of the east stairwell .
i just want to clean up greendale .
are you saying greendale is dirty ?
oh , boo .
boo .
well ...
of course it &apos;s dirty .
everyone knows that .
i don &apos;t , annie .
i think it &apos;s clean .
i think it &apos;s the cleanest school
in the entire country .
you know it is .
looks like jeff winger &apos;s really got this thing in the bag .
sure does , troy .
say what you will about this or that ,
but people just like the guy .
read my lips ...
no matter what you &apos;re told ...
we have to clean the mold .
no matter what you &apos;re told ...
we have to clean the mold !
that &apos;s right , people !
no matter what you &apos;re told ...
we have to clean the mold .
come on .
yeah !
well , this is interesting .
annie edison has reduced her platform
to one issue and turned that issue into a sound bite .
and it rhymes and people love it .
this election &apos;s become a real horse race .
according to our polls , the campus is almost
evenly divided .
now keep in mind the margin of error
on this thing is about 98 % .
could be higher .
we don &apos;t even know how to do margins of error .
we talked to two people at a vending machine .
well , i &apos;m being told we &apos;re taking a quick break ,
but stay tuned .
they have to stay tuned .
it &apos;s closed circuit television .
don &apos;t know what that means .
and we &apos;re out .
can i get an apple juice , please ?
freshly squeezed this time or so help me god , maurice .
abed , those guys in the suits
are trashing your dorm room real bad , bro .
what are you doing ?
random spot check , mr. nadir .
stay out of our way .
nothing suspicious .
glenn , bring the car around .
what are you looking for , robin ?
fertilizer , car battery , pvc piping ,
anything suspicious .
because you think i &apos;m suspicious ?
or because you wish i was suspicious ,
so that you would have an excuse to see more of me .
this was a random spot check .
do you like me ?
that &apos;s not really relevant .
that &apos;s close enough .
are you sure ?
you smell like nice soap .
i have to go .
i &apos;m sorry you weren &apos;t a more obvious
potential threat to the country .
people are pretty excited about this black mold issue .
we &apos;ll see .
for my closing statement , i &apos;m thinking
about smashing a watermelon with a hammer .
jeff , if i admit politics are stupid ,
will you stop making them stupid ?
you &apos;re gonna split the vote and starburns
is gonna end up president .
i &apos;m the only one up here who &apos;s trying to get something done .
and you deserve to be allowed to do it ?
you &apos;re entitled to be president ?
the gloves are coming off . you understand me ?
i have an audio @-@ visual presentation .
wow . i &apos;m shaking .
you should be . you should be .
all right , let us resume .
star @-@ burns , we haven &apos;t heard from you
on this black mold issue .
yeah , i actually withdraw my candidacy .
i fear a political career will shine
a negative light on my drug dealing .
thank you .
dean , before this election stops being about the issues ,
i have a question for my opponents .
what &apos;s your favorite color ?
mine &apos;s a three @-@ way tie .
red , white , and blue .
magnitude , a response ?
i think you know , dean .
pop ! pop !
oh , i set him up .
i have an audio @-@ visual presentation , dean .
oh , well , that sounds interesting .
what &apos;s your presentation , annie ?
my presentation is a copy of jeff winger &apos;s
1997 audition tape for mtv &apos;s the real world .
what ? what ?
let &apos;s just roll it . thanks .
hey , i &apos;m jeff winger and i &apos;d love
to be on mtv &apos;s real world : seattle .
so check this out .
well i guess it would be nice
if i could be on mtv
so please please take a look at me
for the real world
oh i &apos;m gonna apply twice
where the hell did you get that ?
folks , who do you want shaking joe biden &apos;s hand at 5 p.m. ?
me or ...
shut up ! i was , like , 19 .
we &apos;ve all been 19 , jeff , and none of us did this .
none of us .
to that sea town yeah
pop ! pop !
i hate you !
i hate this school !
and i hope you all get black mold poisoning !
oh , jeffrey , no !
i hate you ! i hate you ! i hate you !
oh , jeffrey , no .
you &apos;ve got to have jeff jeff jeff
are you in here ?
yeah , to be alone .
i &apos;ve already established the men &apos;s room doesn &apos;t work .
you have an apartment .
there are people in the parking lot
singing that song .
i went too far .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know it would be that bad .
you knew .
you didn &apos;t care .
but don &apos;t apologize .
i got what i deserved .
i am a gross , jaded adult
with control issues that couldn &apos;t let
a young , bright , idealistic kid
run for president .
wait , isn &apos;t there a final round of debates ?
yeah . i--
you guys !
you &apos;re missing it !
troy , i &apos;m out .
me too .
i withdrew my candidacy .
nobody that treats a friend the way that i did
is fit to represent the student body .
uh , yeah , i know you &apos;re both out .
i &apos;m saying you &apos;re missing it .
it &apos;s the political showdown of the century .
come on .
pop ! pop !
pop ! pop !
pop ! pop !
pop ! pop !
you should have stayed in the running .
you &apos;re the only real candidate .
no , i was just another jerk
trying to win a contest .
you were right the whole time .
i just couldn &apos;t admit it until i saw you
running away crying .
yay .
i care what you think about me , you know ?
yeah , well , i care what you think about me .
that &apos;s why this happened .
okay , well ...
resolved , then .
resolved .
when we seek to destroy others ,
we often hurt our self .
because it is the self that wants to be destroyed .
pierce , you &apos;re not usually so poignant .
well , vicki finally lent me her pencil .
oh , my god ! pierce !
go to the health center !
yeah .
well , we &apos;ve finally reached the end of election road .
arguments have been made , pops have been popped .
hearts have been stirred , perhaps broken .
the only thing that remains is to tally the vote
in this matchup between the youthful ,
charismatic magnitude ,
and the leonard &quot; the human raisin &quot; rodriguez .
two men fighting for the same piece of earth .
one recently born . one soon to die .
a competition reflecting the pointlessness of life .
pull up , abed . you &apos;re in a nosedive .
i &apos;m being told now that dean pelton
is prepared to announce a winner .
we take you now live to across the room .
okay . here we go .
thank you , sergio .
with 11 votes cast--
11 ? come on , people .
the landslide winner of the student election
with seven votes is ...
south park .
okay . you know what ?
i seem to recall this is why we abolished
student government in the first place .
this is exactly what happened ten years ago .
hey , how hard is it to get rid of black mold ?
what do we need , buckets and sponges ?
i don &apos;t actually know .
we &apos;ll look it up .
m &apos;lady .
well , there you have it .
in a shocking write @-@ in upset ,
the comedy central cartoon series south park
has been elected president of the greendale student body .
not that shocking to me . i voted for it .
for real ?
mm @-@ hmm .
me too . aww .
we can never stop being friends .
as the confetti gets swept away
and we begin gearing up for next year &apos;s election ,
for gctv , i &apos;m abed nadir saying ,
&quot; did you know you could make napalm
out of common dish soap and cat food ? &quot;
what ?
why would you say that ?
vohlers .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
we &apos;re gonna have to move on to city college .
apparently there &apos;s an elevated threat level at greendale .
but don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll check it out ... personally .
whatever .
i had a dream i was the regular president .
you &apos;ve done so much for our city .
kickpuncher , is there anything that we can give you ?
don &apos;t call me kickpuncher .
call me ... david .
this was fun .
maybe you can observe me having dinner
next time you &apos;re in town .
honk twice for &quot; yes , &quot; once for &quot; no . &quot;
