yeah , i &apos;m just walking in now .
hang on . i got to turn this thing off .
disarmed .
not ready to arm .
yeah , i know . it talks .
man , i &apos;m telling you , this new place is state of the art .
yeah , i just got the last box out of storage ,
so as of tonight , we are officially moved in .
dude , relax , okay ?
we &apos;re better than fine .
we &apos;re growing faster than
90 % of the tech start @-@ ups in the country .
yo , i got to go .
don &apos;t worry so much , okay ?
we worked hard to get here .
let &apos;s at least try to enjoy it .
♬ the killing season , it &apos;s beginning ♬
♬ i feel your hands around my throat ♬
i agree .
it &apos;s so important to enjoy your work .
♬ you either lose or come up winning ♬
♬ now , paint it , mary , paint it black ♬
♬ tonight , they hang jerry ♬
♬ tonight , they hang jack ♬
♬ when this killing season &apos;s over ♬
♬ i &apos;ll never say your name again ♬
say &quot; cheese . &quot;
we &apos;re out of time .
he &apos;s going into hypervolemic shock .
what do we know ?
white male , approximately 30 years old .
two gunshot wounds . one to the left upper extremity .
may have hit the brachial artery .
what the hell did he do ?
genius dug one of the bullets out himself .
tom ?
tom ?
you know this guy ?
not really .
friend of a friend .
yeah , well , your friend &apos;s friend
is in a lot of trouble .
paramedic who brought him in notified the police .
they &apos;re sending detectives to question him .
it &apos;s gonna be a short conversation if we don &apos;t hurry .
his pulse is dropping .
where is he ? do you know ?
he &apos;s not answering his cell .
i &apos;m gonna take a shot in the dark
and assume you mean tom .
did you hurt him ?
why would you think that ?
&apos;cause the last time i spoke to him ,
he told me we &apos;d be free .
of you .
i am not your tom problem , lizzy .
tom is your tom problem .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll turn up soon enough .
why are we at an art exhibit ?
because roberta smith at the times said it was worth a look .
and it seemed like a fitting spot
to introduce our next adventure .
you &apos;re looking at a crime @-@ scene photo .
it appeared online a few hours ago ,
along with a breaking @-@ news bulletin
about the murder of randy brenner
at his new home in richmond .
the local police are flummoxed .
it obviously wasn &apos;t your typical home invasion
or burglary gone wrong .
it wasn &apos;t a crime of passion .
it is , in fact , to one somewhat disturbed individual ,
quite literally a work of art .
those who know of his existence call him drexel .
considers himself a performance artist .
and like most performance artists ,
his work is a form of social commentary .
most performance artists
don &apos;t kill people in service of their work .
last winter , he murdered the owner
of one of the largest c.a.f.o.s in europe .
c.a.f.o. ?
a controlled animal feeding operation .
hung the owner up on a hook like the cattle they butcher .
a little heavy @-@ handed .
drexel does not employ subtlety to get his point across .
his work shows up in unexpected locations ...
sometimes only for a few hours .
this man has fans ?
people support him ?
yes .
a small @-@ but @-@ rabid following .
death as entertainment .
drexel makes them feel part of something --
an underground protest movement .
and how do you know drexel killed randy brenner ?
because he &apos;s advertising it .
下一件杰作正在创作中
according to reddington , this photo started circulating
two hours before randy brenner &apos;s body was discovered .
which means the killer probably took the photo .
so how did reddington get his hands on it ?
it was published online in an underground zine
called rigby .
apparently they post about all things underground .
someone using the handle &quot; rimona &quot;
wrote an article promoting drexel &apos;s next show .
&quot; coming soon !
the next masterpiece is already under way . &quot;
so randy brenner &apos;s murder
was one component in some kind of art exhibit ?
and this drexel -- nobody has any idea who he is ?
well , there are rumors online --
an art professor , a political journalist .
some think he &apos;s an urban myth .
reddington &apos;s looking for rimona .
apparently she &apos;s gonna have an exclusive interview
with drexel in next week &apos;s edition .
fine .
in the meantime , get out to the crime scene
before that body is removed .
something up ?
tom didn &apos;t show up for dinner last night ,
and he &apos;s not picking up his cell .
probably just a misunderstanding . he &apos;ll turn up .
that &apos;s what reddington says .
look ...
i know your decision to give up your child for adoption
probably wasn &apos;t an easy one .
but given everything you and tom have been through ,
i get it .
and i want you to know i &apos;m here if you need anything .
did you tell cooper about the adoption ?
you told me to cancel the baby shower .
i told everyone .
samar , why would you ...
are you upset ?
no , i just hadn &apos;t decided how i was gonna tell the others .
you feel guilty .
you shouldn &apos;t .
society has every woman feeling like her primary role
is to have a child .
it &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t want children .
i want a career .
men can have both ,
but for women , it &apos;s like having two full @-@ time jobs .
liz , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry that i overstepped .
i wasn &apos;t thinking .
but there &apos;s no shame in your decision .
detective quinn .
donald ressler .
thanks for holding down the fort .
you want to walk me through it ?
been stewing in his own juices for a while .
would have had the body removed a while ago
if you hadn &apos;t called .
who found him ?
guy &apos;s name &apos;s adelson -- joseph p.
business partner in some kind of start @-@ up .
said they had plans to work from here this morning .
m.e. ?
best guess on cause ?
someone snapped our vic &apos;s neck like a chicken
last night around 10 : 00 p.m. , give or take .
that phone .
it was there when they found the body ?
as far as i know , no one touched it .
what the hell is that ?
you got a line on the killer , don &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s why you guys are here . you know who did this .
something like that .
very good , agent whoever you are .
smile for the camera .
look , i &apos;m just saying , in the end , women want babies .
a lot of women give up their children for adoption .
almost always under extraordinary circumstances ,
which i completely understand .
is that a fact ?
it &apos;s how women are wired .
keen &apos;s gonna keep that kid .
sorry for the wait .
jon adelson .
thanks for seeing us so quickly .
we know you &apos;ve had quite the morning .
randy and i weren &apos;t just partners .
we were best friends since college .
what-- whatever i can do .
we understand that you spoke with randy last night .
yes .
can you tell us what you talked about ?
work .
we started this company a year ago , and --
you guys are a financial @-@ services company ?
we provide our customers with one networked portal
for all trading , financial news and commentary .
research .
competitive field .
guess you guys built a better mousetrap , huh ?
we &apos;d like to think so .
the house randy bought was expensive .
business must be good .
what exactly are you looking for ?
i mean , i spoke with one of the local detectives ,
and he seemed to think
that randy was killed by a burglar or ...
with all due respect to the local police ,
we &apos;re not operating under that theory .
because ?
take your pick .
the scuff marks on the hardwood floor indicate a struggle ,
which means that after the murder ,
randy was placed on that couch .
not your average burglar move .
someone wanted us to find him like that ,
just like someone wanted us to speak with you .
now you lost me .
the killer staged the scene .
brenner &apos;s phone was placed in his hands .
the killer knew that we &apos;d trace his last call .
he wanted us to have this conversation .
do you have any idea why that might be , mr. adelson ?
what do you think he hoped we &apos;d discover ?
okay , look , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you think happened here .
you want our books , our clients , be my guest .
randy was like a brother to me .
you get that ?
clearly , he &apos;s hiding something ,
but i don &apos;t think he has any idea who killed brenner .
seemed a little nervous .
maybe he thinks he &apos;s next .
aram . - okay , the computer you sent me from randy brenner --
the webcam is definitely the source of the rigby photo .
so drexel accessed the webcam remotely .
correct .
i just analyzed the hard drive and found a rat .
a rat ?
remote access trojan .
it takes over a system , accesses the webcam .
but the thing is , this is not your average rodent .
from what i can tell , it uses artificial intelligence
to modify its payload , which is rare .
like , super @-@ rare .
in fact , i &apos;ve seen this exact a.i. automation before -- once .
as part of a classified security briefing by the nsa .
so , how did a performance artist
get his hands on classified nsa technology ?
you know what ? call the security directorate .
tell them we need to set up a meeting now .
いらっしゃいませ
unfortunately , we don &apos;t open for another hour .
right . which is why we &apos;re here now .
we &apos;ve come for the fugu kimo .
fugu kimo ?
blowfish liver .
contains a poison 1,200 times deadlier than cyanide --
so lethal , a single fish can kill 30 grown men .
people eat this ?
not legally , no .
but as with most dangerous endeavors ,
there are those who feel compelled .
tetrodotoxin first creates a tingling in the lips ,
then the hands .
if you &apos;re lucky and your chef is meticulous ,
you can survive with a story and an adrenaline rush .
but if you &apos;re not , the poison can kill you in minutes .
this way , please .
what you are asking for , this is against the law to prepare .
ah , chef hanzo .
and yet i hear you prepare it so brilliantly .
who told you this ?
my associate and i read about it .
you were featured in an online publication called rigby .
a marvelous story .
relax , hanzo @-@ san .
we &apos;re not here to cause trouble .
we just want a little information .
i &apos;m trying to get in touch with the woman who interviewed you .
rimona .
perhaps you can find us a phone number .
tom , is that you ?
liz , listen to me . you need to ...
nik ?
it &apos;s --
liz , listen to me .
it &apos;s about tom .
paramedics brought him in here a few hours ago .
he &apos;s been shot .
shot ? !
is he okay ?
where is he ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
he won &apos;t be out for another couple of hours .
but you need to know ...
the police are here .
and one of them told a nurse
he was here to question a robbery suspect .
you still there ?
please tell me he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s alive ,
but i can &apos;t honestly promise you he &apos;s gonna make it .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s a simple question .
is the program an nsa exploit or not ?
hey , look , technically i &apos;m not authorized
to comment on any program -- - cut the crap .
that program was found on a home computer .
now it &apos;s connected to a homicide .
so i suggest you start commenting .
yeah .
it &apos;s ours .
and it &apos;s highly classified .
it &apos;s a mega rodent , a rat on steroids .
it -- it lets us take remote control of any system on a network .
including stealth access to webcams ?
desktops , laptops , security feeds ,
hell , even baby monitors networked to wi @-@ fi .
it &apos;s a premium @-@ grade spy tool .
if it &apos;s out there in the wild ,
we have a national security issue .
what ? what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i think it &apos;s about to be someone &apos;s last day .
where are you going ? - i just -- i got to hit the head .
aaron mulgrew .
going somewhere ?
it &apos;s a miracle he survived the surgery .
most of us didn &apos;t think he &apos;d make it .
will he ?
it &apos;s too early to say .
we &apos;ll know more when he &apos;s conscious .
like i said , he lost a lot of blood --
you &apos;re ...
i didn &apos;t know .
and tom &apos;s ...
obviously .
it &apos;s just ...
when i saw you last , it didn &apos;t seem like you were together .
it &apos;s complicated .
the detectives left a number .
we &apos;re supposed to let them know when he &apos;s awake .
robbery ? that &apos;s all you heard ?
all i know is , it sounded serious .
you really have no idea what he was doing ?
nope . no idea .
all i know is that he had the delusion
that we could be a family ...
that we could get away from ...
reddington .
and you think that &apos;s impossible ?
you have no idea what it &apos;s like ...
to feel like you &apos;re trapped ...
to feel like your life isn &apos;t your own anymore .
you can &apos;t prove i leaked that program .
i got to say , aaron ,
you had a much better chance of us believing that
before you ran like a scared little girl .
fbi and nsa techs are tearing apart every system you own .
we have teams at your house , your office ,
your storage locker .
what are they gonna find at your storage locker , aaron ?
all right , if i talk ...
we talk to the u.s. attorney .
maybe he skips the treason charge ,
sticks with espionage act violations .
see , there &apos;s a bigger picture here , aaron .
that program you leaked --
it was found on a home computer at a murder scene .
okay , i don &apos;t know anything about a murder , but ...
maybe i did upload the program .
to where ?
i built a site for it . i posted the raw code .
but these things they make us develop , they are dangerous .
do you know what that &apos;s like ?
creating something , knowing that when you &apos;re done ,
it &apos;s gonna be used to victimize innocent people ?
so , what ?
what , this was like a political statement ?
i just don &apos;t think that the government or anybody
can be trusted with that kind of power .
so i leaked it .
and it never occurred to you that criminals might use it ?
or this country &apos;s enemies ?
yeah , it occurred to me .
that &apos;s why i modified the code
to include a phone @-@ home component .
whenever the program gets used ,
it makes contact with my server
so i can track who &apos;s downloaded it .
we &apos;re going to need that data .
well , if you raided my storage locker ,
then you already have it .
as far as you go , pops .
whatever you &apos;re looking for , this ain &apos;t it .
pops .
you know , i always liked that name .
louis armstrong was called &quot; pops . &quot;
willie stargell , the legendary pittsburgh pirate .
my lord , that man could smack a fastball .
there was pops foster , pops fernandez ...
all right , let &apos;s go , pop .
oh , my .
and then there are different pops entirely .
like the pops you hear when your shoulder &apos;s being dislocated .
i need you to hop on that radio of yours
and let whoever &apos;s in charge know that i &apos;m outside .
raymond reddington .
i mean , you &apos;re actually him .
indeed .
can , uh , i ask how you found us ?
i read rimona &apos;s piece on torafugu kimo .
chef hanzo and i just became friends .
he said i could reach her here .
mr. reddington , with only the greatest respect ,
i &apos;m sure you can appreciate the people who write for rigby
prefer to keep their identities private .
it &apos;s not her identity i &apos;m interested in .
it &apos;s the subject of her next profile --
drexel .
look ...
it &apos;s bad business for a journalist to burn a source ,
but maybe i can make up for the indiscretion .
what do you have in mind ?
an interview .
with you .
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
first , i need to speak with rimona .
where are we ?
cyber techs recovered the laptop
mulgrew used to upload the mega rodent to the web .
and this is the phone @-@ home log that mulgrew created .
the i.p. address of everyone who &apos;s ever used the program
is on that list .
which means one of those is probably drexel .
how many addresses are we talking about ?
too many .
it will take weeks to process .
if reddington &apos;s right ,
drexel &apos;s not gonna wait for us to catch up .
what about adelson , the business partner ?
anything out of line ?
t.b.d.
we just got all of his company &apos;s financial records .
let &apos;s get on it .
if we don &apos;t find drexel soon ,
we &apos;re gonna have another body on our hands .
what about agent keen ?
i haven &apos;t seen her since this morning .
she just left word -- on her way to see reddington .
he &apos;s in the hospital !
he was shot !
not on the street . let &apos;s get in a car .
he was involved in some kind of robbery ,
and now the police want to question him !
lower your voice , lizzy .
no .
i am not your lizzy ...
to control , to be told what to do .
don &apos;t you get it ?
the only reason tom did what he did
is because he had to do something desperate to get away from this .
you made yourself clear this morning , elizabeth .
you can blame me if you like .
damn right , i blame you .
if he dies ...
if he dies ,
it &apos;s because he put himself in exactly the wrong place
at exactly the wrong time .
he did this , not me .
and that robbery the police want to ask him about --
diamonds .
he was part of a team
that stole tens of millions of dollars &apos; worth of diamonds .
a team i hear included his ex @-@ girlfriend gina zanetakos .
he &apos;s reckless , dangerous .
he &apos;s not worthy of being your husband ,
and he sure as hell is not worthy of raising that child .
there &apos;s nothing here . it &apos;s a start @-@ up .
they have clients , but it &apos;s nothing earth @-@ shattering .
not enough to explain how brenner could afford that house .
he was into something --
something that drexel intended to expose in his next exhibit .
but nothing in these books is going to tell us what that is .
maybe we can ask drexel himself .
dembe just called .
reddington has reason to believe he &apos;s operating out of new york city .
i &apos;m on it .
okay , here we go .
of the 1,000 @-@ plus downloads of the nsa program ,
13 are from the new york metropolitan area .
five trace back to apartments leased by women .
it &apos;s unlikely , given the way that brenner &apos;s neck was snapped .
looks like four are public places --
three librabies and one internet café .
and these last three
were downloaded in the last few hours --
after brenner was murdered .
leaving ...
2890 central avenue , brooklyn .
contact the new york field office .
get up there as soon as possible .
bring him in .
all clear .
set up outside . be ready in case he comes back .
this is our guy .
ressler .
what the hell is this ?
tom , you &apos;re okay .
you &apos;re in the i.c.u.
don &apos;t try to talk .
you need to save your strength so i can kill you .
i didn &apos;t know if i was ever gonna see you again .
either of you .
i &apos;m sorry .
ma &apos;am ? detective savino , metro p.d.
i &apos;m gonna need you to step out of the room , please .
he &apos;s barely conscious .
you don &apos;t need to do this right now .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
is he under arrest ?
tom , don &apos;t say anything !
he &apos;s invoking his right to counsel .
okay , here &apos;s what i could find .
the space was leased six months ago
to a reginald turner , age 44 .
paid all six months in advance
and gave one character reference --
a high @-@ school art @-@ history teacher in virginia ,
who he listed as a former colleague .
we should be able to run with that .
already running .
that &apos;s him .
&quot; reggie turner ,
local teacher opens first solo gallery show . &quot;
当地教师首次举办个展
drexel &apos;s real name is reginald turner .
so he is an artist .
at least he was .
from what i can tell , he only had one show ,
a pop @-@ up gallery in the east village ,
and the reviews were not kind .
navabi .
it looks like drexel has been watching these guys for a while .
we &apos;ve got two , three dozen photos here ,
half of randy brenner ,
half of jon adelson , the partner .
i think it &apos;s time we go at adelson and rattle his cage .
what do you need from us ?
aram , there &apos;s a laptop here .
we &apos;re gonna need you to get remote access , see what you can find .
no problem .
i know just the mega rodent for the job .
ah , the fair rimona .
reddington .
how did you get in here ?
how did you even find me ?
i know you suggested to your editor
that we meet later in the week ,
but i &apos;m afraid our business couldn &apos;t wait .
our business ?
you mean your business .
&apos;cause my work doesn &apos;t involve burning sources .
your source is a serial killer .
look ...
drexel obviously wants to remain anonymous .
as a reporter , i have to honor that ,
regardless of what he &apos;s suspected of .
as a reporter .
amazing times , these , don &apos;t you think ?
when any tom , dick , or sally
with a laptop and internet access
can declare herself a journalist .
i mean , you don &apos;t even use a last name .
i would be thrilled to write a profile on you
when all this is done , but i &apos;m not gonna help you find drexel .
oh , but i think you will , rachel .
that is your name , isn &apos;t it ?
rachel hobbs .
daughter of randall hobbs ,
the patio @-@ furniture king of costa mesa , california .
i admire your respect for anonymity , rachel ,
but your principles are a luxury i can no longer afford .
so i &apos;ll give you a choice --
you can protect his anonymity or yours .
i didn &apos;t kill randy .
we believe you .
then why are you here ?
well , you may not know who killed brenner ,
but you definitely know why .
and whatever he was into ,
whatever the two of you were into --
this is crazy .
look , we can help you ...
before whoever came after randy comes after you .
we &apos;re done .
you want to talk to me again , i want a lawyer .
aram , i can &apos;t talk .
we &apos;re right in the middle of--
interviewing adelson .
i know . i am watching you right now .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m looking at drexel &apos;s laptop .
randy brenner &apos;s computer isn &apos;t the only one he ratted .
he &apos;s running another video feed from adelson &apos;s office .
look to your right . there must be a webcam .
on his desktop , yeah .
he &apos;s recording everything ,
and not to the system -- to some remote location .
i don &apos;t know where . here , let me try something .
two more feeds just popped up .
okay , you guys should get back here .
i &apos;m here .
my voice is not to be recorded .
of course . i can take notes .
begin walking -- now .
straight ahead , toward the exit .
keep walking .
keep walking .
the staircase on your left -- take it .
do it now .
dembe .
we get a call --
a crew hit reinder @-@ de groot .
next thing we know ,
a guy matching the description of one of the perps
stumbles in here all shot up , won &apos;t say why .
that &apos;s just a coincidence .
we got the head of corporate security coming over now .
name &apos;s klerken .
ring a bell ?
he &apos;s gonna walk in here and identify you .
case open , case closed .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
no , it isn &apos;t .
it is .
everything will be okay .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive the security precautions .
as you know , my work is , uh , inflammatory .
i rely on the support
of the enlightened patrons who value my efforts ...
one of whom was kind enough
to make this space available for our interview .
it &apos;s fine . really .
so , did ...
did you have a question ?
you seem ...
uncomfortable .
uh , no .
i -- sorry .
yes . of course i have questions .
honestly , i &apos;m familiar with your work ,
and it &apos;s not every day that
i find myself alone in a basement
with a man who , um ...
kills .
yes .
understandable .
but i assure you , you have nothing to fear .
unless ...
that is , you &apos;re hiding something .
raymond reddington .
i saw him .
you brought him here .
no , i ...
does he know about me ?
what i &apos;ve done ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
does ... he ... know ?
where the hell is keen ?
no word from her . or reddington .
sir , you &apos;re gonna want to take a look at this .
this is a continuous feed being run live
from adelson &apos;s office .
drexel wasn &apos;t just ratting randy brenner .
he was recording footage from multiple cameras .
recording to where ?
we &apos;re still not sure .
from how many sources ?
so far , i &apos;ve only seen four .
one was from randy brenner &apos;s house .
the second , adelson &apos;s office .
and these are the other two .
who is that ?
we don &apos;t know yet ,
but that &apos;s probably $ 100 grand ,
and that is definitely a semiautomatic .
drexel figured out what these guys are up to .
can you trace the feed ?
working on it .
no ! wait ! no , please !
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
you &apos;re hurting me !
get her out of here .
okay , mr. klerken .
when we go inside , i &apos;m gonna ask you only two questions --
one , do you recognize anyone ?
when you answer yes , my next question
will be &quot; from where do you recognize him ? &quot;
if it &apos;s him , i &apos;ll know right away .
i spent a good amount of time
with the scum who stole from us .
sir , do you recognize anyone ?
well ...
i damn well better .
i &apos;m the one who trained him .
you want to say that again ?
he &apos;s not your guy .
tom , thank god you &apos;re okay .
tom ?
tom keen .
he &apos;s one of ours .
followed after the crew that hit us .
risked his life in the process .
if that &apos;s true , you want to tell me why you never said anything ?
i can answer .
my men are under strict instructions
not to speak to anybody but me ,
even the authorities .
i hope i &apos;ve been of help .
east garage , this is altmeir . i think we have a problem .
breach !
stay right in the chair for me , please .
you can &apos;t --
what the hell is this place ?
you know , i &apos;ve often considered my love of art ,
and i realized it &apos;s not just the art --
it &apos;s the artist .
i like art a lot ,
but i love artists .
i love the stories behind their work ...
the characters .
lopping off ears ...
rankling the establishment with paintings of soup cans ...
often boldly revealing themselves
to our keen observation and insight , our scrutiny .
what a marvelous thing , the courage to create .
though i must say ,
nothing about your work strikes me as courageous .
it seems self @-@ indulgent , petulant .
like a tantrum from a child
who &apos;s just realized that the world
can be a dark and unfair place .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not interested in your opinions of my work .
an artist &apos;s job is to speak .
and this latest manifesto ?
beginning with the murder of randy brenner .
what is it that you feel so compelled to say ?
you have no idea what he was doing , do you ?
we call it a rat farm .
a what ?
rat -- remote access trojan .
we know what a rat is .
we also know that you downloaded the nsa program
that aaron mulgrew put online .
so , why call it a farm ?
because it &apos;s a business .
we collect ratted systems , grow them ,
maintain them , and ultimately sell them .
you were right -- as a start @-@ up , headwind was nothing special .
randy and i were struggling
until we got lucky and he found that program .
you saw a golden opportunity .
gold ?
what you are looking at
is worth a hell of a lot more than gold in today &apos;s market .
this is what people want -- access .
you want to spy on a sorority girl ?
maybe you want to know what your local politician
likes to do at home .
trade secrets of a fortune 500 company .
we commandeer their systems ,
then stream the feed like a broadcasting network .
cops , nannies , teachers .
people pay to access the feeds ?
we offer a range of pricing options .
single fee , package of five ,
or unlimited streaming for those who prefer to browse .
look , i lied to protect this place ,
but i swear i told the truth about randy .
i didn &apos;t kill him , and i don &apos;t know who did .
all those people ...
stars of a show they don &apos;t even know exists .
an enemy of mine contacted you .
okay . hang on .
a work was commissioned .
that was a job .
i need to know how to find your benefactor --
now .
i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ it was all done anonymously .
i got meticulous instructions
for what to paint and where to send it .
an address .
you can answer me ,
or i can turn that wall behind you into a jackson pollock .
you think it was reddington ?
it had to be .
he got to klerken .
he intimidated him , or he paid him off . i don &apos;t know .
my question is , why ?
this was his chance to get rid of me .
when i confronted him ,
i didn &apos;t know what you were being accused of .
i just said you were part of some sort of robbery .
he already knew .
he told me about the diamonds .
how ?
because i told him .
i don &apos;t understand . you told him ?
since when do you talk to reddington ?
i do more than talk to him , liz .
i work for him .
i have ever since the day he was shot .
i &apos;m part of his mobile surgical unit now .
you warned me not to take his money .
i should have listened .
nik , i had no idea .
three nights ago , i was standing in an abandoned garage ,
pulling a 9mm slug from the liver
of a 32 @-@ year @-@ old weapons dealer from kuala lumpur .
so when you say he makes you feel trapped ,
like your life isn &apos;t your own anymore ,
i know how that feels .
why did you do it ?
you don &apos;t want me to be with tom , but you saved him .
people say youth is wasted on the young .
i disagree .
i believe wisdom is wasted on the old .
all you can do is part with it , but very few will take it .
least of all , the people closest to you .
they want no part of it .
no matter how often i warn you about tom ,
you seem intent on discovering those perils for yourself .
thank you .
i know ...
i say things that unsettle you
about the dangers that lie ahead .
i know i anger you with things i say about tom .
but if i &apos;ve ever given you the impression
that you won &apos;t survive this ,
that you and your child aren &apos;t going to have the simple life
that i know you long for , i &apos;m sorry .
because you are going to have that , lizzy .
♬ all of the time , i see you ♬
so , now we know what brenner and adelson were up to .
but what about drexel ?
♬ or do i see you at all ? ♬
all the footage he &apos;s been gathering --
we still haven &apos;t figured out where it &apos;s being recorded
or what he planned to do with it .
♬ i wanted so much to need it ♬
♬ but i couldn &apos;t feel it at all ♬
♬ given the hand that feeds you ♬
♬ do you feel hungry at all ♬
tell us a little about elizabeth .
i remember the first time she brought up adoption .
she was so nervous .
she tried to cook dinner , which was a complete disaster .
i think it was around my third bite of cold spaghetti ,
she just started to cry .
and i don &apos;t know . i think she was afraid of disappointing me .
but she told me she wanted to adopt .
you know , with so many children in need of a loving family ,
as she put it .
in that moment , i just ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever loved her more .
she &apos;s gonna be a great mom .
i mean , she really is .
♬ trouble again ♬
♬ troubled by time ♬
♬ trouble again ♬
♬ oh , your troubling mind ♬
i &apos;m sorry .
for what i did .
oh , it was stupid .
yeah .
and i almost lost you because of it .
and the idea of that ...
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
that i would never see you again ...
i know . wait .
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
oh , my god .
i felt it .
right there .
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
i want to keep the baby .
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
♬ you &apos;re wearing me down ♬
our baby .
where &apos;s rostova ?
who ? i don &apos;t know who --
nine days ago , a painting was commissioned .
it was sent to this address ,
shipped to you -- mr. paul allond .
yes . i ...
i &apos;m a dealer .
a private art broker .
i received a call . no name was given .
she said a piece had been acquired and was nearly finished .
she asked that it be sent to me .
for pickup .
yes .
but not by her . by you .
i assume you &apos;re the one she spoke of .
reddington .
she said you would come .
you can send it back .
