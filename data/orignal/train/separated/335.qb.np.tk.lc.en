max , i feel like this woman on tinder
is lying about her age .
if she &apos;s 78 , i &apos;m 25 .
i &apos;d say she &apos;s 80 , but that rack is 40 .
well , maybe i can squeeze her in tonight ,
but i already got eight dates .
with my arthritis it &apos;s impossible to swipe left .
girls , you &apos;re going to have to close up tonight .
i &apos;m pretty sure i have a date with earl .
han , your only friend that isn &apos;t imaginary is here .
he &apos;s dropping my vip passes to game con.
ned &apos;s demo @-@ ing the brand new video game he created ,
and i &apos;ll be there
hanging out in the cosplayer &apos;s lair .
is that where you don &apos;t get laired ?
thank god i didn &apos;t tell you it was sponsored by virgin .
i don &apos;t get video games .
in my day , if you wanted to enter another reality
you just took acid and went to the aquarium .
game con has awesome swag bags .
this year they &apos;re handing out ipads ,
and last year i got the microsoft surface .
you are a micro @-@ soft surface .
have fun at lollapa @-@ loser .
i would never go to lame con.
i &apos;ve got to go to game con !
so we can make fun of han some more ?
because video games really seem to be my put @-@ down sweet spot .
caroline , it &apos;s about time you knew .
i &apos;m really into video games .
i &apos;ve known since i was ten .
max , are you coming out to me as a game woman ?
there was this arcade
at the pizza place my mom used to leave me at .
ms. pac @-@ man taught me how to swallow pills .
all right , well , if we &apos;re confessing things ,
i really want a free ipad , so i guess
you &apos;ll have to be nice to that nerd ,
even if he is a customer .
all right , we got this .
suck it up .
i &apos;m not sucking anything .
hey , everybody !
well , i guess it &apos;s true what they say .
you can &apos;t hire my manicurist
to put an addition on your apartment , yeah .
oh , you &apos;re renovating .
that explains the banging and power drills i hear .
most of that was us .
we got some new sex toys .
it &apos;s like santa &apos;s dirty workshop up there .
see , we &apos;re splitting the boudoir in half
so the baby can have its own bedroom .
its own bedroom ?
so the baby that you &apos;re not even pregnant with yet
is doing better than old caroline ?
no , ming wa wants me to give up my walk @-@ in closet .
i mean , that &apos;s where my purses and half my hair live .
so purses and hair are doing better than old caroline too ?
uh , earwax is doing better than old caroline .
come on , caroline .
let &apos;s shake these asses and get them passes .
do you think i should shave my back
for tomorrow for game con ?
my mom does .
here are your fries .
ned , have you been working out ?
you know my name ?
max , take your hand away .
you &apos;ll kill him .
is there any way you can get me into game con tomorrow ?
oh ! this is rich .
the hot girls need something from the nerds
like in science class or any marriage in l.a.
i don &apos;t have any more tickets ...
or now a will to live .
so ... this is awkward .
well , puberty &apos;s a challenging time , han .
i did it !
i got us in .
max , again , i feel like the homeless shelter
would be a step down for us .
to game con.
i got us jobs as booth babes !
i &apos;d rather go to the shelter .
what are booth babes ?
we just have to wear these dresses ,
look hot , and hand out some flyers .
like a sexy jehovah &apos;s witness .
wearing that ?
where &apos;s the top ?
that is the top .
okay , where &apos;s the bottom ?
you &apos;re looking at it .
where &apos;s the middle ?
that &apos;s it .
and the rest ?
oh , right .
slutty boots !
are we really gonna show our vaginas for a gift bag ?
yes , what else are they for ?
you heard han .
we could get a tv , xboxes , your precious ipad .
at the very least , bottled water .
it &apos;s just so degrading to parade around in short skirts
and be fake nice to nerds and ...
oh , my god , that &apos;s what we do at the diner .
hey , girls .
we had to fire our contractor .
yeah , it &apos;s just taking too long .
it &apos;s like having sex with a guy on prozac .
been there .
and i &apos;m still waiting .
so we hired my cousin .
she and i have become close since we stopped dating .
i mean , we were going to stay at a hotel ,
but why do that when we can stay with friends ?
friends ? what friends ?
not you , caroline . max .
i can &apos;t believe what i &apos;m wearing .
this dress sets women back further than hbo &apos;s &quot; ballers . &quot;
well , i think it &apos;s nice to be paid to put on clothes for once .
&quot; ant thrax &quot; ?
you &apos;ll have to get it .
i can &apos;t bend over any further
or everyone will see my playstation .
did a very slow earthquake just hit this booth ?
hi . is this , like , a real dance ,
or should i go get help ?
they &apos;re not having seizures .
i think we &apos;re supposed to dance like that .
max ? caroline ?
even though you just saw us doing that ,
we are still so much cooler than you .
yes , but the gap &apos;s getting smaller .
how did you two get in here ?
a continuing series of bad decisions .
you wouldn &apos;t help us ,
so we decided to be booth babes .
the most recent in the continuing series of those bad decisions .
max , caroline , i &apos;d like you to meet my gamer crew .
basically , my han @-@ tourage .
you were right , this thing was sponsored by virgin .
if you guys are here ,
who &apos;s watching your grandmother &apos;s basements ?
and this is my plus @-@ one , eunice .
aka super nintend @-@ ho .
we never met till today .
isn &apos;t he the cutest ?
he saved me from a burning village ,
and then he asked me to marry him .
actually , my avatar asked
her avatar to get married ...
in the game .
congratulations .
that &apos;s not sad .
i &apos;m gonna go get my pixel pie a drink .
it &apos;s the least i can do for the man
who pulled me from a roaring inferno .
hurry back !
i should have let her burn !
are you kidding ?
she &apos;s your type :
willing .
but i can &apos;t be tied down .
between this vip pass
and my suite at the holiday inn express ,
i could be the don juan of game con.
she &apos;s coming !
oh , where &apos;s han solo going ?
uh ... the pokemon booth started a flash mob
and they needed a pikachu .
death bitch !
i knew you seemed familiar .
you look like that new character , death bitch .
your booth is right over there .
it &apos;s the most popular video game here ...
after &quot; girlfriend simulator . &quot;
oh , my god , max .
look .
han &apos;s gamer friend nerd is carrying you away .
and i do not like where he has his hand .
ned , stop !
yeah .
at least buy me drink first .
i &apos;m just gonna put this down .
ned , this is your game ?
you turned max into some kind of boobarella .
i &apos;m sorry , you weren &apos;t supposed to see this yet .
i was going to invite you to the official release party .
if this guy &apos;s having a release party ,
it &apos;s probably into an old sock .
by the way , i &apos;m taking this .
i need someone to cover my shift at the diner tomorrow .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll need to work at the diner
after you &apos;re compensated for ned stealing your likeness .
my mom said it was fine .
i can get money for this ?
because i &apos;m pretty sure
&quot; grand theft auto &quot; is based on how i got to new york .
how you doing ?
tony shapiro , rock n &apos; roll games .
recently divorced .
tony , i don &apos;t think you bargained for
a wharton @-@ educated booth babe ...
and neither did i.
but your designer stole my friend &apos;s likeness
without her consent ,
so we &apos;re entitled to a percentage of the profits .
this illustration is not so similar that it would hold up
in a court of law .
oh , my god , death bitch .
that &apos;s not her .
the hell it &apos;s not .
look at her , dude .
one , two .
look , it &apos;s clear you guys don &apos;t have the money for a lawyer .
that &apos;s true . keep talking .
but i get you want a payday ,
so i will pay your friend to play amorta
and take pictures with the fans at our photo booth tomorrow .
you &apos;re in luck .
the model we hired died of an overdose .
at least she died doing what i love .
tony , we may look like we &apos;ve settled in life ,
but we aren &apos;t gonna settle here .
we stand to make millions if we take you to court .
no , you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s true , keep talking .
what do you want ?
throw in a free ipad
and i &apos;ll deliver her on @-@ time and clean .
you &apos;ll get me here on time .
um ... what &apos;s happening here ?
is this the foreplay or the cleanup ?
sophie &apos;s using a pedegg on my feet .
and it tickles .
yeah , you know , if you go just one day
without shaving calluses ,
you &apos;ve already lost the war .
yeah , well , i &apos;m sorry for the mess .
uh , i had to bring down some basic necessities .
yeah , like ... like plates and cups and toilet paper .
wait , is that a tv and an xbox in my apartment ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;ve been waiting for this day my whole life ,
and now that it &apos;s here i &apos;m shy .
yeah , this is how we watch tv .
we get hulu , netflix , youtube ...
youspank ...
spankbank ...
pornonthecob .
can i pop in this sweet demo game i got today ?
it &apos;s a hyper @-@ sexualized , violent version of me
who kills everyone who gets in my way .
it &apos;s a biopic , really .
stick it in and i &apos;ll watch you play .
gosh , if i had a nickel every time oleg said that ...
you &apos;d be able to afford a hotel room ?
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna go in the other room ,
anywhere but here ...
which now smells like patchouli and pierogis .
oh , we have a sex swing now .
welcome to asrieth , amorta .
you must kill anything that moves .
go .
this chick is my spirit animal .
all she &apos;s doing is drinking from a flask
and punching people in the face .
max , she &apos;s just like you .
yak girl , come !
i need you !
what &apos;s that silly animal thing ?
yak girl .
i think she &apos;s my sidekick .
that thing looks just like caroline .
it does !
it looks like caroline !
why did i hear my name ?
why am i seeing a horse thing that has my face ?
please , caroline , it &apos;s not a horse thing with your face .
it &apos;s a yak thing with your face .
that &apos;s the sound you make
when you have to do side work at the diner .
yak girl , come !
hey , look .
max , you &apos;re riding her .
oh , no , no way .
i &apos;m calling that tony jerk right now .
so what ?
she just lets death bitch ride her ?
that &apos;s all yak girl does ?
no , she poops when you hit this button .
ah , caroline can &apos;t stop pooping !
just like that one time at the diner .
tony , this is caroline channing ,
aka yak girl .
i am taking you to court .
that &apos;s true . keep talking .
that &apos;s your big offer ?
that i dress like that and take pictures with nerds ?
well , let me just say to you , sir ,
i will need an ipad , as well .
somebody better go out and get that toilet paper .
how long till death bitch ?
i have to go take my medication .
what are you taking ? you got any extra ?
right this way .
this is so exciting .
this will be fun .
i haven &apos;t been paid to be a bitch
since i worked at the dmv .
ooh , a green screen .
look , i &apos;m on another planet .
finally got that vacation .
hey , yak girl , come on out . time is money !
you okay in there ?
this is what it must be like for kim kardashian to enter a room .
all right , it &apos;s pretty simple .
one picture .
and don &apos;t worry if you get a boner .
we &apos;ll crop it out .
could i be any more humiliated ?
i just want a photo with her .
not you .
i guess you could .
fine , i &apos;m probably due for a poop , anyway .
i &apos;m okay !
can you chop my head off ?
it &apos;ll be the best head you &apos;ll ever get .
all right , get out of here . i killed you .
hold on .
death bitch , say your catchphrase .
remember : even in death ,
you &apos;re my bitch .
i &apos;m really liking this identity .
it &apos;s better than the other 17 i &apos;ve had .
nobody wants to take a photo with me .
i mean , baby got yak , right , max ?
will you just let me enjoy this ?
this is a dream come true for me .
i &apos;m at a game convention .
i &apos;m the star of a video game .
i can kill without consequences .
i &apos;m pretty much peaking right now .
yeah , well , i have hooves .
can i just be upset for one minute ?
max , hide me .
looks like you &apos;re doing a pretty good job of that yourself .
seriously , help .
get back here , han solo !
you promised we &apos;d build our lives together .
we shared that hot pocket &quot; lady in the tramp &quot; style .
两人咬住同个食物两端 慢慢往中间吃去
uh , miss ?
there &apos;s gotta be better people out there .
have you tried literally anyone else ?
i convinced my sister to sign me out for this weekend ,
so you are not gonna stop me from seeing my han .
back off , amorta !
uh , han , you &apos;re on your own .
i can &apos;t ruin this costume .
i &apos;m gonna need it the next time i have to get out of jury duty .
oh , no , i &apos;m a goner .
she &apos;s gonna eat me alive .
you should have seen her go to town on that hot pocket .
out of the way , han . i &apos;ll show you all
i can do more than just poop .
uh , yak girl ?
your heinie quarters are showing .
got it .
this is gonna make the girl i &apos;m catfishing real jealous .
hey , earl .
hey , caroline . hey , max .
hey , max .
hi , max . hey .
look at that .
i have the exact same antlers .
that &apos;s not me .
you can tell by how fast she &apos;s moving .
know what &apos;s not moving fast ?
our construction .
yeah , we had to fire oleg &apos;s cousin .
turns out the sexual tension was still there .
her body ... not so much .
yeah , so it &apos;s gonna take at least another week .
a week ?
there goes the &quot; no sex while max and caroline are awake &quot; rule .
that wasn &apos;t sex you were having in front of us ?
max , caroline ,
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;ll ever repay you
for getting eunice off my back .
i do .
sophie and oleg are staying at your place for a week .
i was thinking an extra baked potato with your shift meal .
yeah , han , um ...
how much bouncing can your bed take ?
you &apos;re killing me , max .
yep , even in death ,
you &apos;re my bitch .
