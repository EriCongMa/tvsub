long before online dating ,
single people bared their souls on videotape ,
and this is what it actually looked like .
hi . i &apos;m maurice .
i &apos;m an executive by day and a wild man by night .
i &apos;m not afraid to get sand on my tuxedo
if you &apos;re not afraid to let the wind
mess your hair up a little bit when i take the top down .
and video dating had finally hit the suburbs of philly .
excuse me , ladies .
how would you like to meet the man of your dreams ?
you &apos;re really old .
ouch .
but , no , i &apos;m talking about
the romantic wave of the future --
video dating .
it &apos;s a real business .
using our advanced vhs technology
and a one @-@ time fee of $ 399,
followed by lifetime monthly fees of only $ 19.99,
anyone can now find love .
so , which of you lonely hearts is looking for mr. right ?
well , i &apos;m not , but
i am not a sad @-@ sack loser .
i choose to be alone , and it &apos;s the best .
it is the best , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s too bad because for a limited time ,
anyone that joins the vd community
gets a free tote bag for just $ 12.99 .
i am not carrying around a bag that says , &quot; i heart vd . &quot;
my god .
wait , i have the perfect customer for you -- my dad .
he &apos;s totally ready to get back out there .
hell , no !
why would i ever do video dating ?
i &apos;m living the dream .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the afternoon , and you &apos;re still in your robe .
so ? a robe is just a long jacket made of towel .
lots of people wear these .
not to other people &apos;s homes .
in this house , we keep it loose .
dad , it &apos;s been four years since mom left .
isn &apos;t it time you got set up with someone ?
set up ? did somebody say &quot; set up &quot; ?
who am i setting up ?
no , stop . we don &apos;t need your help .
bill &apos;s gonna do video dating .
video dating ?
i will find you love .
sorry , but , uh , your way of matchmaking
is a thing of the past .
please . i am literally responsible
for setting up over 200 couples ,
which means i &apos;m personally responsible
for over 62,000 babies .
yeah , that &apos;s not real math .
bill , would you rather put your heart
in the hands of a proven love champion
or risk everything
with someone whose romantic record is a little spotty ?
honestly , i &apos;d rather not do either .
hey , my record is not spotty .
and i &apos;m , like , the best ever at love .
yeah , not so much .
and when you think about it , you &apos;ve only had one boyfriend ,
and that was two years ago .
right , dante . what a character .
his name wasn &apos;t dante .
he had that small hand .
who are you thinking of ? and i &apos;m alone by choice .
ha ! please .
you only liked geoff after he wanted nothing to do with you .
oh , yeah ?
well , i &apos;ll show you friggin &apos; jerkuses
how friggin &apos; great i am at friggin &apos; love
when your dad &apos;s walking down the friggin &apos; aisle .
see , you don &apos;t even know that men don &apos;t walk down the aisle !
gah ! bill , get out of your bath clothes !
i &apos;m finding you love again .
okay .
oh ! my bad !
i &apos;ll get -- ohh , my back !
don &apos;t worry , pal . i gotcha .
no , no , bruce lee style . hyah !
beverly , i &apos;m gonna need a warm towel .
oh , it &apos;s traveling ! it &apos;s moving south ! aah !
good luck , schmoops .
get the small boy . have the small boy stand on me .
it was september 28 , 1980 @-@ something ,
the day of the career aptitude test .
done ! now all i got to do is sit back
and let this test decide my entire future .
got any predictions ?
it &apos;ll either make me an nfl punter ,
motorcycle detective , or land pirate .
bookkeeper ? ! i don &apos;t want to be a librarian !
bookkeeper &apos;s not a librarian , you moron .
it &apos;s more like an accountant .
why didn &apos;t i get an awesome job like boat owner
or rap mogul or neighborhood oracle ?
what the hell &apos;s an oracle ?
a guy who sees the future .
i can see your future .
you &apos;re mowing lawns for the city .
never ! i will be a rich neighborhood oracle ,
and nothing you say can stop me .
couldn &apos;t predict that , could you ?
as barry was having trouble seeing the future ,
erica was trying to find bill his future wife .
trust me , mr. lewis , your romantic future starts now .
and to my doubters , you can go on down to sears
and buy a vacuum so you can suck it .
yes , bill , there &apos;s no better place to find love
than next to lady foot locker .
put her there , bill . john calabasas , love doctor .
no medical degree .
i &apos;m legally required to say that now .
bill , i want to show you something .
this is a videotape of one of our biggest success stories ,
and this could be you .
why , hello , there . the name &apos;s big al .
and like a fine wine ,
i just keep getting better with age .
my god . that &apos;s why he &apos;s been out every night this month .
so let &apos;s have some fun .
and that &apos;s how love is made .
i don &apos;t know , erica . maybe your mom &apos;s right about all this .
your friend makes a good point about me being right , erica .
yeah , normally , i just go with the flow ,
but i &apos;m starting to take sides here , too .
everyone stop talking . trust me , mr. lewis .
i know love and romance . it &apos;s my jam .
so let &apos;s just give it a shot .
and three , two , one , get some !
hi . this is bill lewis of bill lewis flooring and tile .
i &apos;m looking for a nice , clean lady
to spend my days with .
it used to be my wife .
oh , no .
man , she was pretty . smelled nice .
tight , little body from all the jane fonda .
son of a bitch , billy boy ! you had it all !
no .
ouch .
daddy ?
one day she just walked out on me .
all she left behind was this single leg warmer .
i wear it on my arm to keep her close .
not good .
hard to watch .
dang it , i miss you so much , pookie !
so , so much !
also , you must be stacked .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
okay , cut . great . i think we got it .
i don &apos;t think you did .
as erica &apos;s matchmaking was stalling out ,
barry &apos;s career planning was just revving up .
corporate leader ? !
i know , right ?
evy told me what bubbles to fill in ,
and now i &apos;m gonna be a ceo .
she says i &apos;m a natural leader .
sit up straight .
yes , my love .
this is bull crap !
there &apos;s no practical job that will ever meet
barry &apos;s three criteria for career awesomeness .
one -- a position of unchallenged authority .
you &apos;re stretching all wrong , matt raymer .
i want you to drop into a lunge right here .
that &apos;s the quad . work the quad .
that is the engine room of the body .
two -- no desk or formal pants .
this is where games are won or lost .
there you go . what are you looking at me for ?
and three -- it requires athletic skill
and physical intimidation .
you call that a chest pass , luke schmidt ?
run laps till you see god .
shake a leg .
in that moment ,
my brother finally knew what his future would hold --
kickballs , tube socks , and a shiny whistle .
coach , i want to be your athletic apprentice
so that one day i can take your place
when you climb that big rope into the sky .
ah , i see . goofing on old coach , huh ?
well , we &apos;ll see who &apos;s laughing after you do 3,000 squat thrusts .
no , i &apos;m serious .
i want to teach gym , sir .
my god . it &apos;s finally happening .
i &apos;m gonna be a mentor .
are you crying ?
my eyes are just celebrating .
here . take this .
training begins now !
damn it , i broke it !
why do i have such powerful lungs ?
no , it &apos;s a training whistle .
you &apos;ll get the tiny , little ball that makes it work
when you &apos;re ready .
when will that be ?
coach will know .
now let the physical education education begin .
first up , drink this mix of celery and cod .
glug hard , boy . glug hard .
while barry hit a home run with his new career ,
erica was striking out at matchmaking .
swing and a miss . bill struck out .
not one response to his video .
how is that possible ?
honestly , i &apos;ve never seen such a negative reaction ,
and a lot of my clients are just me in different costumes .
there has to be someone for bill .
this thing guarantees a match .
no , it says it &quot; gurantees a match . &quot;
and that &apos;s not a real word ,
so it &apos;s not a legally binding contract .
don &apos;t make me leave empty @-@ handed .
please , i need to find someone .
erica ?
oh , hi , guys . what you doing ?
geoff put some charm jewelry on layaway .
what are you doing ?
are you video @-@ dating ?
what ? no , no , no .
i &apos;m only here to help set up my best friend &apos;s dad .
i know when i say that out loud ,
it doesn &apos;t sound great or real , but it &apos;s both .
well , best of luck with whatever this is .
gross .
young love .
look , i need to find bill someone .
it &apos;s how i &apos;m gonna prove that i &apos;m good at this .
with the tape bill made ? not a chance .
well , then i &apos;ll make a better one .
and i &apos;ve got just the person to help .
nerd , i need you to make an awesome video for lainey &apos;s dad .
holy balls ! my first professional paid gig !
i &apos;m not paying you .
still a professional gig , though .
it &apos;s really not .
i see it now .
we open on a time portal
as mr. lewis &apos; cold , naked body spills to the earth .
he rises from the smoke like a love terminator .
yeah , no nudity or time travel .
just make mr. lewis look cool -- you know , macho .
we &apos;re making a picture ! an adam f. goldberg joint .
what &apos;s with the &quot; f &quot; ?
there &apos;s another adam goldberg at school .
he &apos;s super @-@ sensitive .
i don &apos;t want to cause any marketplace confusion .
don &apos;t worry about it . no one cares about either of you .
but i wasn &apos;t the only one landing a gig
in my chosen profession .
that looks broke . let me fix that .
hey , i was practicing my tooting skills .
coach said the whistle is the foundation from which the gymnasium arts were built .
you &apos;re just gonna sit here and let him do this .
it was nice and quiet . he said it was for school .
it is !
i &apos;ve finally decided on a career path .
i &apos;m gonna be a p.e. teacher .
oh , my .
dad , you &apos;re right . it &apos;s time i find my place in society .
and what could impact society more than me teaching youth
how to do light exercise and parachute games ?
i fully support you 100 % .
seriously ? ! dude !
i thought you were gonna stomp on this dream like all the others .
nah , it &apos;s too good .
it is .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna go grab some shut @-@ eye .
it &apos;s 6 : 30 .
i &apos;m waking up at dawn .
me and coach are going on a 12 @-@ mile jog ,
then we &apos;re powering down a classic english breakfast .
why ?
he likes to start each morning
with 5,000 to 6,000 calories --
bangers and mash , kippers , kidneys ,
boiled and fried potatoes , black and white pudding ,
three kinds of meats .
his mom &apos;s british .
seems like a lot .
she &apos;s a handful , but i like her .
anyway , off to bed .
i don &apos;t understand , mur .
are you actually okay with your son being a gym coach ?
just like everything else ,
the kid will move on to the next stupid dream of his .
and what if he doesn &apos;t ?
believe me , he ain &apos;t getting up
at 5 : 00 in the morning to move his body .
we &apos;re golden .
dig deep . imagine a jaguar &apos;s chasing you .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m miserable , but happier than i &apos;ve ever been .
it was the day of the big premiere ... of a dating video .
but , hey , it was still a premiere .
before i begin , i have a few words to say .
webster &apos;s dictionary defines &quot; masterpiece &quot; as --
press &quot; play . &quot;
okay , without further ado ,
i present to you bill lewis , as requested , a real macho man .
hi . i &apos;m bill lewis .
and i like to dance , get sweaty , and have some fun .
i &apos;m ship shape and ready for love .
hey , let &apos;s build a relationship .
you have the right to fall in love
with bill lewis of bill lewis tile and flooring .
hey , what are you doing ?
destroying this and starting over .
but i gave you exactly what you asked for -- macho .
your dad was a shirtless cowboy ,
a sweaty cop , a leather @-@ clad biker .
oh , i see it now .
erica , it &apos;s time to hand me the reins .
this is the job for the yentadex .
what the hell is that ?
every yenta has a rolodex
filled with perfect matches for everyone they know .
so buckle up , bill .
you &apos;re about to go on the ride of your life .
no , there will be no buckling . i &apos;m handling this .
okay , i appreciate everyone &apos;s help ,
but i &apos;m shutting this down .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m not over my wife .
we all get one true love , and she was mine .
there is no way you only get one soul mate in life
because he &apos;s in love with someone else ,
and then i &apos;m gonna be alone forever ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let that happen to you , bill !
wow . she &apos;s a passionate young lady .
got most of her facts wrong ,
but her heart &apos;s in the right place .
hey , guys , i really need your help .
each of you grab a leg and push .
i ate nine bananas ,
but i &apos;m still cramping up something nasty .
damn it , you ate all my bananas ?
i &apos;m in real athletic pain !
sit , al .
nobody is touching those legs in those tiny shorts .
these are official coaching bottoms .
sure , they cinch up the bathing @-@ suit area ,
but coach says i &apos;ll eventually reach
a healthy level of crotchular numbness .
for the love of god , take &apos; em off !
you &apos;ll never have kids .
gym teachers don &apos;t have kids .
their kids are the students they teach .
all right , enough with this gym crap .
sit down . &quot; clash of the titans &quot; is on .
they &apos;ve got oracles . you love oracles .
eh , seers and wizards
don &apos;t fit into my new , healthy lifestyle .
i &apos;m gonna go blend up a power shake .
so much fiber .
the body really is an amazing organ .
one point , two points , three points .
four points , barry .
what imaginary game is he playing ?
there &apos;s no way to know .
i mean , of all his farkakte dreams ,
this is the one he &apos;s going with .
this is a nightmare .
do something !
i will !
thanks for sitting down with me , rick .
anything for my protege &apos;s old man .
in a way , it &apos;s like we &apos;re married .
yeah , that &apos;s gonna make this easier .
uh , thing is , barry &apos;s not gonna be a gym teacher .
what &apos;s that now ?
i think that woody allen said it best .
&quot; those that can &apos;t do , teach .
and those that can &apos;t teach , teach gym . &quot;
how dare you .
you call that a woody allen impression ?
this is a woody allen impression .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m doing .
you got to stammer like -- like this .
use your hands more .
forget woody !
here &apos;s the deal --
no more physical education education !
seems to me you &apos;re implying
that being a gym coach isn &apos;t good enough .
no , i think what you do is amazing .
just not for my son .
you &apos;ve seen your life . you get it .
well , he may be your son , but he &apos;s my gym son .
that &apos;s not a thing .
oh , it is .
there &apos;s no such thing .
there &apos;s no greater bond in the world
than between a coach and his boy protege .
i think except for the bond
between a dad and his actual boy .
well , may the best father win .
well , that &apos;s me . i &apos;m his father .
and i &apos;m his coach @-@ father .
we &apos;re done here .
and so began the war over barry &apos;s future .
meanwhile , my sister was so shaken by bill &apos;s words
that she turned her matchmaking skills on herself .
hi . i &apos;m erica . i &apos;m not desperate or anything .
i just want to make sure
that i don &apos;t miss my one chance to have a happy life with geoff .
can i start over ?
webster defines &quot; love &quot; as -- nope .
geoff , geoff , geoff , geoff , geoff . okay .
i think i got it out of my system ,
so let &apos;s geoff this one more time .
i mean , look at this photo of evy .
are you freaking kidding me ?
he &apos;s gonna be an eye doctor
because he &apos;s gonna follow in his dad &apos;s footsteps .
it &apos;s a safe career ,
but we would have had a beautiful home .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t be crying .
this is bad .
i don &apos;t know who this geoff guy is ,
but i think he may have dodged a bullet .
all right , ladies and actual ladies ,
it &apos;s time to pick captains for today &apos;s game ,
which would be ...
it &apos;s your class , coach . your call .
not today .
i want you to take this little cork ball
and jam it into your whistle , coach .
physical education education just got real .
you mean i &apos;m ready ?
damn right you &apos;re ready . this is your class now .
today their fate is in your hands .
name your game .
anything ? even crab soccer ?
you can crab any sport you like , son .
he who holds the whistle makes the laws .
you heard coach tasty . crab formation now !
that day , barry invented crab hockey .
as a gym coach , he was a natural .
show me some hustle !
second place is the first place of losers .
&quot; winning &quot; spelled backwards is &quot; gninniw . &quot;
it &apos;s never okay to put butter on a doughnut !
champions are losers who forgot to give up !
sweat is the body &apos;s tears crying away the weakness !
it doesn &apos;t fit !
this game doesn &apos;t make any sense !
some things aren &apos;t meant to be crabbed !
then run laps , atkins ! now !
how &apos;d it feel , son ?
i &apos;ll never forget this moment , coach , as long as i live .
hey , bar , look what i got for you at spencer &apos;s gifts .
is that a crystal ball ?
just like the real professional oracles use .
that &apos;s what you want to be when you grow up , isn &apos;t it ?
it is ! see you around , coach .
what just happened ?
well , coach , i &apos;ll put it in terms you can understand .
you lost .
but i gave him a whistle ball .
and i gave him a better ball .
don &apos;t sweat it . you &apos;ll find another gym son .
no , for once , someone really looked up to me --
what i do , who i am .
and you took it away with a trip to the toy store .
i hope you feel good about yourself .
it hurts when you put your tongue to it .
convinced she was facing a loveless life alone ,
my sister was desperate to find out her future .
very desperate .
hey , um , gonna be honest here .
i &apos;m struggling real bad ,
and i heard that dad bought you a crystal ball .
i &apos;ve been expecting you , my lost child .
to be clear , i know this is ridiculous and not real .
i just need to hear something encouraging .
i &apos;ve been expecting you , my lost child .
stop talking like that
and tell me i &apos;ll have a boyfriend one day .
i &apos;ve been expecting you , my lost child .
i hate you .
then take my hand ,
and let &apos;s journey into tomorrow and beyond .
come on , mur .
are you sure this is better than gym coach ?
from way downtown ! bang !
i got a hole in my heart .
is everything okay in here ?
what do you care , dream crusher ?
about the other day ... i feel bad .
i shouldn &apos;t have said that what you do isn &apos;t good enough .
what do you feel bad for ? just telling the truth .
look , if barry wants to have a career like yours ,
i won &apos;t stand in the way .
what about his new life as a boy @-@ witch ?
that &apos;s not gonna last .
hey , you were the only one
who made him take his future seriously .
yeah , well , i guess that &apos;s what a halfway decent coach does .
more than a coach -- gym dad .
damn you , goldbergs .
you always know how to hit me in my biggest muscle --
my heart .
although my -- my biceps are nuts , huh ?
it wasn &apos;t up to my dad to decide barry &apos;s future .
but erica was hoping my mom knew hers .
you swore you &apos;d never look in my yentadex .
you were right .
i &apos;m , like , really bad at love .
trust me . you &apos;re not .
i just wish i didn &apos;t blow it with geoff .
it really hurts , you know ?
it just -- it hurts .
i know , schmoops .
but you &apos;ll find the right guy when the timing is right .
i just know it .
that day , my sister realized there were no easy answers
when it comes to who you &apos;re supposed to be with .
even though my mom knew otherwise .
truth is when you &apos;re a kid , the future is always uncertain .
that &apos;s game . hit the showers .
there &apos;s no crystal ball that can give you the answer .
hey , coach . i , uh ...
i thought you might want this back .
no , keep it .
maybe you need a hand putting away those hockey sticks ?
eh , you run along . i got this .
but with the right people in your corner supporting you ,
you &apos;ll always come out a winner in the end .
mr. lewis ?
hello !
the sun &apos;s out .
where &apos;s your day robe and your overall bummer vibe ?
well , i guess all this dating talk got me thinking
maybe i am ready to give love another shot .
well , unfortunately , mom &apos;s not here ,
and she hides her yentadex .
but perhaps i can help . come , my child .
i see a beautiful , bubbly blonde .
she loves shorts and the beach .
oh , yeah , i like where this is going .
and she has a friend .
there &apos;s two girls ?
yes , three is company .
hot damn . when do i get to meet &apos; em ?
all you got to do is knock on their door .
i do ?
they &apos;ve been waiting for you .
it &apos;s &quot; three &apos;s company , &quot; bill . it &apos;s a popular tv show .
he forgets what he watches , and he thinks it &apos;s the future .
all right ! forget that !
let me clear my mind and start over .
i see you and a woman .
one of you is the boss . but who is the boss ?
i actually saw that coming .
