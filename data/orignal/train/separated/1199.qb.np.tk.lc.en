we &apos;re worried about you .
why ?
have you been taking pills to stay awake ?
the shadow in the picture is you ?
why didn &apos;t you tell us before ?
there was always a part of me
that wondered if that was my fault .
you &apos;re just getting out of a relationship .
i &apos;m completely out , it &apos;s done .
i wish you could have told me what was really going on ,
instead of me finding out this way .
this is for you .
my job is especially hard when you realize
that you &apos;ve turned innocent people into collateral damage .
alison is running out of money
and shaun is the only one who knows how to reach her .
you knew alison .
i was writing a book about her .
that &apos;s what i was to you ? i was research ?
i swear , i will burn this .
no , i want to know what was worth destroying everything
we had for .
did you actually read any of this book ?
a few pages .
bits and pieces .
ezra knew who i was before we met .
he knew who all of us were .
and he knew alison too .
so he admitted to being in a relationship with her ?
yeah , a brief one .
then he must be board shorts .
well , ezra didn &apos;t try to kill alison .
his whole book is trying to piece together who did it .
how is he gonna do that
when the police can &apos;t even figure it out ?
i don &apos;t know .
he has a theory though .
and ? what is it ?
he thinks that one of us did it .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
well , now we know it &apos;s a work of fiction .
which one of us is he trying to pin it on ?
i didn &apos;t get that far .
you didn &apos;t think to ask ?
why ?
we know that that &apos;s not true .
just because he wrote a book doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
you know , he could be using it as a way to place the blame on
one of us and keep suspicion off of him .
no , he doesn &apos;t need to do that .
he knows that ali &apos;s alive .
but he didn &apos;t know that when he started writing the book .
guys , listen , ezra &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
he &apos;s a writer who found a great opportunity
to make a name for himself and he used me .
he used us .
so wait , what are we saying ,
that all of that stuff in that room in ravenswood ,
that was just research for his book ?
he &apos;s been working on it for years .
well , we &apos;ve seen the surveillance equipment ,
so we know he &apos;s been watching us .
he &apos;s probably just hoping that we &apos;d lead him to alison ,
so he could finally get his big ending .
if he &apos;s been watching us , then he has to know about &quot; a. &quot;
i mean , how could he sit back all this time
and not do anything to help you ?
it &apos;s simple .
he never really loved me .
you all right down there ?
i &apos;m a bit jet @-@ lagged .
i just got back from europe .
so do you go to hollis ?
just graduated .
i &apos;m gonna start my first teaching job .
i love this song .
b @-@ 26 .
what &apos;s your major ?
well , i &apos;m leaning toward english .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m teaching .
and i write , too .
but and so far it &apos;s mostly personal , just for me .
maybe you &apos;d let me read something of yours ?
yeah , you &apos;d really want to ?
yeah .
you &apos;re smart . you &apos;ve traveled .
you have great taste in music .
i &apos;d like to know more about you .
morning , honey .
you want some coffee ?
yeah .
black please .
somebody going on a trip ?
yeah . your mother and i spoke with dr. griggs this morning .
and he thinks it would be best that we get you some help
before the situation gets worse .
what kind of help ?
he recommended a rehab facility in philly .
rehab ?
i don &apos;t need to go to rehab .
sweetie , i know that you called his office
impersonating me to renew your prescription .
i just needed help getting through a couple of tests .
we &apos;ve heard that before , spencer .
look , i admit that i lost control .
okay , but it &apos;s not like last time .
i &apos;ve only been taking the pills for a few weeks .
and how were you even getting them without a prescription ?
just different people at school .
it &apos;s not that hard .
please , i &apos;m still applying to colleges .
i can &apos;t have radley and rehab on my record .
all i &apos;m asking is that you give me one chance
to get off them on my own .
please .
but ...
okay .
we &apos;ll give you the chance .
on the condition that you take the withdrawal medication
under our supervision .
i promise .
and you come home immediately after school every day .
i will .
thank you .
this is it , spencer .
next time there won &apos;t be a discussion .
i understand .
hey , you .
nice suit .
do you have a job interview after school or something ?
not exactly .
look , i &apos;ve been meaning to call you and apologize .
it &apos;s just that i feel bad for
you know , what happened .
i should have never kissed you that day .
don &apos;t sweat it .
look , it &apos;s not that i didn &apos;t enjoy it .
it &apos;s just i wasn &apos;t in a place to start something--
hanna , it &apos;s fine .
okay , i get it .
i just-- i don &apos;t really have time to talk right now .
why ? where are you going ?
court .
court ?
what did you do ?
nothing .
it &apos;s my dad .
remember the thing with wilden ?
well , he was blackmailing my dad for a reason
and now the cops are coming down on him for it .
this is all my fault .
i made you choose my family over yours .
you didn &apos;t make me do anything .
it was my decision .
and if i had to do it again , i &apos;d make the same one .
i got to go .
how are you feeling ?
nauseous , achy , tired .
other than that , fantastic .
can i do anything ?
no , thank you for asking .
are you sure ?
yeah . please .
let &apos;s talk about anything other than me .
shana called me this morning .
from georgia ?
did she say why she left ?
all she said was she needed me to drop
ali &apos;s money off to a p.o. box in wallingford
before 6 p.m. today .
wallingford ?
that &apos;s over an hour away .
yeah .
i don &apos;t think that you should go .
why not ?
one minute she &apos;s here and in the next she &apos;s not
and then she &apos;s calling out of the blue
for an urgent money drop .
we know ali needs the money , spence .
what &apos;s going on ?
we thought you were taking the day off .
need to speak to ezra face @-@ to @-@ face .
well , wait , aria .
i don &apos;t know where the truth begins and where the lies end .
hey , listen .
we don &apos;t think you can get answers , okay ?
and you certainly deserve them .
but confronting him at school is not the best idea .
where is ezra ?
do you mean mr. fitz ?
yeah . i need to speak with him .
do you know where he is ?
mr. fitz took time off for a family emergency .
is there something i can help you with ?
oh , family emergency ?
right .
god , he &apos;s a liar and a coward .
aria , wait .
i &apos;m fine .
aria , slow down .
i said i &apos;m fine , hanna .
okay , let me take you home .
i come bearing gifts .
cronuts .
what &apos;s that ?
haven &apos;t you heard ?
it &apos;s all the rage , it &apos;s a part croissant ,
part doughnut .
it &apos;s all trans fat .
that &apos;s disgusting .
can i please come in ?
i &apos;m sorry that i ruined last night .
last night isn &apos;t what i &apos;m upset about .
it &apos;s not something that i &apos;m proud of , toby .
how can i help you , if i don &apos;t even know you &apos;re in trouble ?
i get it , okay .
and i would be feeling the same way
but you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i &apos;ve got it all under control .
you look like crap .
yeah , i feel like it , too .
promise me , you will call me
if you get the urge to take pills again .
i &apos;m done with that .
and thank you for my necklace .
hey , stranger .
i was starting to think
i wasn &apos;t going to see you again until graduation .
i know , right ?
we &apos;re in high school ,
we shouldn &apos;t be this scheduled .
what are you doing after school ?
i don &apos;t have practice today .
i have a few errands i &apos;ve to run ,
and then i &apos;ve got to go and visit aria .
she &apos;s having a family crisis .
yeah , i heard she flipped out in fitz &apos;s class today .
yeah , yeah , she &apos;s been under a lot of stress at home ,
but she &apos;ll be okay .
so can you slot me in ?
yeah , my parents are going out tonight ,
so why don &apos;t i call you after aria &apos;s
and we make dinner ?
great .
do you always carry that much cash around ?
it &apos;s a late birthday present from my grandma .
i need to deposit it .
it &apos;s on the list .
what is she , a stripper ?
why give you that much in cash ?
she doesn &apos;t trust banks .
her whole life savings has been stuck into coffee cans
and cookie jars .
listen , i have to hand in my yearbook form
before sixth period .
but i will see you tonight .
yeah .
open up , ezra .
ezra ?
ezra ?
i &apos;m safe for the moment ,
thanks to you .
but you can &apos;t tell anyone you helped me .
promise me you won &apos;t .
okay , i still don &apos;t know who i can trust .
i know this isn &apos;t what she expected to hear
but mr. hobbs is complicit in the crime .
so he gave wilden a little money
for throwing business his way .
he didn &apos;t hurt anyone .
it &apos;s not a small thing , hanna .
look , he did it a few times and then tried to stop ,
but wilden wouldn &apos;t let him .
that &apos;s his version of the story .
when a cop wants to make your life miserable ,
there &apos;s not much you can do .
just ask my mom .
yeah , i shouldn &apos;t be talking to you about this case .
but you &apos;re testifying today .
right .
because i &apos;m the one that connected the money
in wilden &apos;s safe deposit box to travis &apos;s dad .
i need to get to court .
okay , i &apos;m not saying he isn &apos;t in the wrong .
but wilden was a corrupt cop and a bully .
that has to count for something .
don &apos;t you agree ?
my job is to state the facts , hanna ,
not my opinion .
today aria told me she caught her dad
having an affair with a student last year .
alison knew about the affair , too .
aria and her friends blinded jenna in a prank gone wrong .
alison was the instigator .
possible motive for her murder :
someone seeking revenge .
but who ? a boyfriend ?
toby ?
what &apos;s that ?
a gift .
guess it &apos;s better than a needle in the arm .
don &apos;t give &quot; a &quot; any ideas .
i &apos;ll take these and throw them away .
no , i better .
i want to toss it far from this place .
you still up for operation money drop later ?
i can &apos;t let ali down again .
hey . have you talked to aria ?
i texted her a while ago , but i haven &apos;t heard back .
why ?
i went to her house at lunch and she is not there
and she &apos;s not answering her cell phone .
i think i have an idea where she might be .
what the hell happened in here ?
oh , my god . aria .
hey , are you okay ?
every secret i told him about ali
and about me and about you guys ,
he wrote it down , it was all for his book .
aria , if it were me , i would &apos;ve burned this
whole place down .
come on , we &apos;re gonna get you out of here , okay ?
come on .
come on .
wait , you guys .
this is some of the stuff
from ezra &apos;s apartment in ravenswood .
shouldn &apos;t we take it with us ?
spencer , not now .
it &apos;s nothing we haven &apos;t seen before .
can you grab aria &apos;s bag ?
yeah .
spencer , come on .
what are you doing here ?
i just came to see how the sentencing went .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
look , i told you this isn &apos;t your fault , hanna .
i know i didn &apos;t have to .
i wanted to .
so how &apos;d it go ?
actually , much better than we hoped .
really ? yeah .
that cop holbrook , spoke up for my dad .
said he was a decent guy ,
pointed out that he had no priors .
he even reminded the judge
that wilden didn &apos;t have the cleanest past .
wow . so did they drop the charges ?
no , but instead of jail time , they gave him probation ,
community service .
god , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m really happy for you and your dad .
oh , this is him .
we &apos;re going to go celebrate .
can we talk more tomorrow ?
yes , yes , go , celebrate .
thank you .
for what ?
just thanks .
绝对保密
pope private eye .
leave a message , we &apos;ll find you .
depositing the money in your bank account , huh ?
paige .
what are you doing here ?
you followed me ?
i know you were lying about
your grandma and her coffee cans .
what is &quot; a &quot; making you do now ?
this has nothing to do with &quot; a. &quot;
then who &apos;s the money for ?
i wish i could tell you , okay , but i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t or won &apos;t ?
can we not talk about this here ?
i told you i &apos;m going through something .
you &apos;ve been going through something for weeks now .
there &apos;s a lot of money in that envelope , emily .
what don &apos;t you want me to know ?
what is a.d. incorporated ?
give it back , paige .
not until you answer my question .
i told you , i can &apos;t .
well , i can &apos;t let &quot; a &quot; continue to control you like this .
if you won &apos;t tell me what a.d. incorporated is ,
maybe the police will .
no , you can &apos;t take that to the police , paige .
why not ?
because somebody needs that money .
who ?
last chance , emily , i &apos;m serious .
wait .
the money is for ali .
she &apos;s alive .
are you feeling any better ?
worse , actually .
the more i think about it , the stupider i feel .
there had to have been signs .
how did i miss them ?
aria , no one thought he &apos;d be capable of doing what he did .
he fooled all of us .
yeah , but you &apos;re not the one who was sleeping with him .
and if it weren &apos;t for me ,
he wouldn &apos;t know things about you guys .
personal things that i trusted him to keep between us .
aria , he wasn &apos;t just getting information from you .
do you think that &apos;s how he found out ali was alive ?
the grunwald tape ?
yeah , well , it makes sense .
i just-- i don &apos;t even know
how he would have gotten the tape
in the first place .
have you eaten today ?
do you want to get some food ?
no .
we can order in .
you can go pick up food , hannah .
i &apos;ll be fine to be by myself for 10 minutes .
are you sure ?
okay , but
no more torching ezra until i get back .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve known all this time .
you never said anything .
i wanted to tell you , but she begged us not to .
if alison &apos;s not dead , who &apos;s in her grave ?
we don &apos;t know .
does her family know she &apos;s alive ?
the only people that know are the four of us ,
shana and &quot; a. &quot;
emily , if &quot; a &quot; knows that ali &apos;s alive
and &quot; a &quot; is the one she &apos;s been running from ,
then you &apos;re putting yourself in danger
by communicating with her .
maybe .
okay , but she needs us .
ali used and abused you guys .
why would you want to help her ?
she regrets how she treated us .
of course she &apos;s gonna say that .
she manipulates people to get what she wants .
she &apos;s not like that anymore .
she has faked her death for the past 2 years .
she &apos;s definitely still like that .
she &apos;s a sick person .
you need to let her family deal with this .
well , we can &apos;t tell her family .
then i will .
if you do , if you expose her to the world ,
then you &apos;re basically handing her to &quot; a. &quot;
okay , the person she &apos;s been hiding from
for the past 2 years .
and if i don &apos;t , you continue to be a target .
if anything happens to ali ,
i &apos;d never forgive myself ...
or you .
fine .
i won &apos;t say anything .
but you need to do one thing for me .
what &apos;s that ?
cut off communication with alison .
no secret meetings ,
no dropping off packages ,
no interaction of any kind .
you can &apos;t be serious .
it &apos;s the only way i know you &apos;ll be safe .
where are you up to in such a rush ?
oh , just picking something up for a friend in need .
you know , it &apos;s nice
that you care about your friends so much .
it &apos;s a great quality .
don &apos;t lose it .
you know , i was gonna stop by your office tomorrow .
i was surprised to hear that you spoke up for mr. hobbs .
well , that was the right thing to do .
still . i mean , not a lot of people
would put themselves out there like that .
it &apos;s a great quality .
don &apos;t lose it .
seriously . thank you .
hanna .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t know why i just did that .
i &apos;m sorry , i got to go .
cece told me she stopped by the dilaurentis house
to talk to alison the night she went missing .
when cece arrived , she witnessed a fight .
hey !
hey ! this conversation isn &apos;t over .
it is over , spencer .
and so are we .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
damn it , ali . i said , stop !
you &apos;re way out of your league , spencer .
am i ?
are you sure about that ?
why don &apos;t you put that thing down before you hurt yourself ?
cece didn &apos;t tell anyone what she saw ,
because mrs. dilaurentis paid her not to .
mrs. dilaurentis also witnessed the fight .
hey .
get some rest ?
no , i was not resting .
i was just thinking about the night
that ali went missing .
spencer , you &apos;re supposed to be trying to relax .
yeah , i can only remember pieces of the night
because i was taking the pills back then
and the first thing i remember
i was in here with ali and we were fighting
and the next thing i know is that i &apos;m out by the barn ,
telling the girls that she &apos;s missing
and i thought i heard her scream .
why can &apos;t you just stop dredging up the past
and focus on getting yourself better ?
is this the private investigator
you hired to follow melissa ?
were you in my desk ?
i told you to stay out of my office , spencer .
dad , did you hire him to follow melissa or me ?
do you think
that i had something to do with ali &apos;s murder ?
what i think is that you &apos;re having a tough time
with your withdrawal .
and maybe we should just call the doctor .
please don &apos;t do that .
please don &apos;t make me feel any crazier than i already do .
hi , toby .
hey , mr. hastings .
everything okay ?
yeah .
yeah , you know , i think spencer &apos;s just been
cooped up a little too long .
why don &apos;t you guys go take a walk or something ?
i don &apos;t want to take a walk , dad .
i want to know the truth .
just be you ,
could be back in about an hour it will be great .
and i &apos;ll have dinner ready .
yeah , let &apos;s go for a walk and get some fresh air .
okay .
okay what ?
i &apos;ll stay away from her .
you mean it ?
but i have to drop off that envelope .
ali &apos;s depending on it and i gave her my word .
and then you &apos;re done ?
yes .
i &apos;m doing this for you , emily .
because i love you so much .
galassi agency .
hi .
hi , my name is victoria blackwell .
i work at rosewood high school ,
where ezra fitz works .
oh , hi .
you &apos;re in pennsylvania , right ?
yeah , yeah , i am .
actually we just found out about his book
and we wanted to throw him a little surprise party .
do you know if there &apos;s a publication date
set for that yet ?
no . but he &apos;s actually here now discussing it with anna .
so if you call back tomorrow ,
i should have more information then .
toby .
is spencer here ?
what ?
i thought she was with you .
she was .
she asked me to go into the brew and get some coffees
and when i turned around she was gone .
spencer ?
i need to talk to you .
is everything all right ?
do you think that i hurt ali ?
what ?
do you and my father
have some kind of agreement to keep it quiet ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t lie to me .
please .
please , okay , i can &apos;t take any more lies .
you don &apos;t look well , spencer .
i &apos;m calling your parents .
please , it &apos;s a simple question , okay ?
did you or did you not
see me standing with the shovel that night ?
and if you did see me hurt ali ,
then why didn &apos;t you just call the cops ?
you &apos;re hurting me .
i want you to leave ...
now .
aria ?
where are you going ?
ezra &apos;s moving forward with the book .
what ?
he &apos;s meeting with his agent in new york right now
discussing a release date .
release date ? can you just stop ?
i cannot believe that i actually believed
he was going to destroy the book to save our relationship .
now i know that everything he says
or has ever said is a lie .
it &apos;s a big fat lie .
why are you going to principal hackett &apos;s house ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m telling him everything about me and ezra .
what do you mean , you &apos;re telling him everything ?
i &apos;m not going to be the only one
that suffers from this , hanna .
aria , if you tell principal hackett
about your relationship ,
ezra is not just gonna suffer , he &apos;s going to go to jail .
are you taking his side ?
no , of course not .
look , i &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t do this .
i just-- i want you to be clear about
what will happen if you do .
oh , i &apos;m clear .
aria , look , if this gets out , it &apos;s gonna hurt you , too .
it &apos;ll be in the papers all over town .
yeah . do you think i really give a crap about that ?
look , this is gonna affect your family too .
are you sure you want to do this ?
you did the right thing .
maybe i did . maybe i didn &apos;t .
so i &apos;ll meet you back at your place ?
no , i really want to be by myself right now .
aria , i &apos;m not gonna leave you alone .
hanna , you are not listening to me .
i don &apos;t want your company , okay ?
look , i know what you &apos;re going through .
i &apos;ve been through this myself .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
i don &apos;t want to talk to anyone .
i want to be left alone . is that too much to ask ?
okay .
you beat me back .
are you still up for cooking
or do you want to go out instead ?
i &apos;m not really that hungry .
it &apos;s getting kind of late .
i should probably check up on aria .
all right .
well , i &apos;ll just see you tomorrow i guess .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
are we okay ?
i don &apos;t like being given ultimatums , paige .
neither do i.
good night .
you need help , spencer .
hey , mike let me in .
are you going somewhere ?
yep .
where ?
no idea .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t know ?
you &apos;re just gonna keep driving until you figure it out ?
that &apos;s the plan .
i got to get out of here .
hey , let &apos;s talk about this .
i don &apos;t want to talk .
then i &apos;ll come with you .
i don &apos;t want that either .
then what do you want ?
i want for you to get out of my way , emily .
