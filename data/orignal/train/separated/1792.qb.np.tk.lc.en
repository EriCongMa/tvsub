all right , so , shh !
tyra banks is about to kick
someone off america &apos;s next top model .
excuse me , penny , but we &apos;re ...

with her head in the lap of ...
oh , what a coincidence . it &apos;s the future mrs. wolowitz .
yeah , and they can all move in with you and your mother .
the current mrs. wolowitz .
is &quot; qochbe &apos; &quot; spelled with a ( gargling ) or a ( guttural grunt ) ?
why is that mrs. wolowitz crying ?
that &apos;s anais .
none of the other girls in the house like her .
house ? what house ?
they all live in a house together .
a house , where ?
i don &apos;t know . somewhere in l.a.
wait a minute .
you &apos;re telling me that i &apos;m within driving distance
of a house filled with aspiring supermodels ?
yeah , i guess .
and they live together and shower together and ...
have naked pillow fights ?
hey , wh @-@ where are you going ?
to pay my cable bill .
all right , pencils down !
i have &quot; lokh , &quot; &quot; makh , &quot; and &quot; cherrrkh . &quot;
anybody got those ?
did i miss anything ?
did they kick giselle off ?
not yet , but her underwater photo shoot
was an embarrassment .
sadly , mrs. giselle wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine .
lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bug @-@ eyed .
sheldon , the food &apos;s here .
ooh , there &apos;s the house .
freeze frame , freeze frame .
what are you doing ?
marking the star positions and physical landmarks
so we can find the house of the supermodels .
why ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
every week , they kick out a beautiful girl ,
making her feel unwanted and without self @-@ esteem .
a.k.a. the future mrs. howard wolowitz .
is my hamburger medium well ?
yes .
dill slices , not sweet ?
yes .
individual relish packets ?
yes .
onion rings ?
yes .
extra breading ?
i asked .
what did they say ?
no .
did you protest ?
yes .
vociferously ?
no .
well , then what took you so long ?
just eat .
hey , guys , what &apos;d i miss ? what &apos;d i miss ?
giselle &apos;s hanging by a thread .
oh , good , i hate her .
then you &apos;re not invited to our wedding .
here you go .
thank you .
oh , do we have to suffer through this
transparently manipulative pseudo @-@ reality again ?
yes .
you and i have a standing tv schedule ,
which is the result of extensive debate and compromise .
any alterations except for breaking news
have to be pre @-@ approved at the weekly roommate meeting .
put it on the agenda .
but you have to make a motion to put it on agenda .
oh , i &apos;ll make a motion , but you &apos;re not going to like it .
fine . mock parliamentary procedure .
at least put it on mute .
oh , giselle &apos;s not getting kicked off .
it &apos;s totally going to be summer .
what ?
sheldon &apos;s onion ring . just put it back !
it &apos;s one onion ring .
just put it back before he comes !
no , no , no !
no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s where it was .
okay , here he comes . deny , deny , people .
wall of silence .
who touched my ...
penny ! penny did it .
why would you do that ?
i don &apos;t know . i was hungry ?
what &apos;s the big deal ?
the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate .
all right . look , i didn &apos;t know , i &apos;m sorry .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but that is your second strike .
what ?
you have two strikes .
three strikes and you &apos;re out .
it &apos;s a sports metaphor .
a sports metaphor ?
yes , baseball .
all right , yeah . i @-@ i &apos;ll play along .
what was my first strike ?
march 18th .
you violated my rule about forwarding email humor .
i did ?
the photo of the cat who wants to &quot; has cheezeburger &quot; ?
oh , come on . everybody loves &quot; lol cats . &quot;
they &apos;re cute and they can &apos;t spell &apos; cause they &apos;re cats .
i trusted you with my email address ,
and you betrayed that trust by sending me internet banality :
strike one .
touching my food : strike two .
don &apos;t worry . they only stay on your record for a year .
you can get them removed early , but you have to take his class .
come on , i touched one onion ring .
yeah , and then you put it back ,
compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings .
oh , honey , the buses don &apos;t go where you live , do they ?
look , penny , i wish i could be more lenient with you ,
but since you &apos;ve become a permanent member of our social group ,
i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else .
congratulations . you &apos;re officially one of us .
one of us , one of us .
well , what a thrill .
you &apos;re sitting in my spot .
oh , jeez , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
leonard , she &apos;s in my spot .
yeah , yeah . uh , see , here &apos;s the thing .
after you leave , i still have to live with him .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m taking a stand .
metaphorically .
all right , that &apos;s it . strike three .
ooh , strike three .
i &apos;m banished ?
what the hell kind of crap is that ?
listen , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll talk to him .
yeah , you do that .
just so i know , would you be open to taking his class ?
you can do it online !
so based on our triangulation ,
we &apos;ve narrowed down the location of the top model house
to three square miles in the hollywood hills .
or possibly durham , noh carolina .
when we find it , you want to go with us ?
to do what ?
party with the pretty girls , dude !
are you insane ?
you &apos;re not going to party with them .
you &apos;re not even going to get anywhere near that place .
that &apos;s what they said to neil armstrong about the moon .
no one said anything of the kind to neil armstrong .
the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure
to put a man on the moon .
well , my fellow americans , before this year is out ,
we will put a wolowitz on one of america &apos;s top models .
and a large number of people will believe it never happened .
okay , let me guess .
a quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose @-@ intolerant leonard .
thank you .
shrimp caesar salad with no almonds
for the highly allergic kosher @-@ only @-@ on @-@ the @-@ high @-@ holidays howard .
and for our suddenly &quot; back on the hindu wagon &quot; raj ,
the meatlover &apos;s pizza , no meat .
coming right up .
wait . excuse me .
you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger ,
barbecue sauce , bacon and cheese on the side .
oh , i didn &apos;t tell you ?
you &apos;re banished from the cheesecake factory .
why ?
well , you have three strikes .
one : coming in . two : sitting down .
and three : i don &apos;t like your attitude .
you can &apos;t do that .
not only is it a violation of california state law ,
it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy .
yeah , no , there &apos;s a new policy :
no shoes , no shirt , no sheldon .
i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena .
penny , can i talk to you for a minute ?
well , here &apos;s the thing .
um , i talked to sheldon
and he feels terrible
and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line .
really ? well , that &apos;s great .
yeah , so just apologize to him , okay ?
what ? i &apos;m not going to apologize to that nutcase .
oh , come on . it &apos;s easy .
he &apos;ll even tell you what to say .
leard , don &apos;t you get it ?
if you guys keep going along with his insanity ,
you &apos;re just encouraging him .
we &apos;re not encouraging .
it &apos;s more like ... knuckling under .
look , i like hanging out with you guys ,
but i &apos;m not going to apologize for something i didn &apos;t do .
well , actually , technically , you did do it .
that &apos;s strike one , leonard .
there you go : quesadilla .
salad .
there &apos;s your pizza .
and thanks to sheldon &apos;s heated discussion
with my manager
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger ,
barbecue sauce , bacon and cheese on the side .
thank you .
go ahead . eat it .
i dare you
that &apos;s it . there &apos;s the house .
i foundamerica &apos;s top models !
are you sure ?
look , on the roof .
anais and giselle are sunbathing .
european @-@ style .
you can recognize people on google earth ?
of course not .
i got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over .
norad ? you &apos;re using military aircraft ?
it was already targeted to poke around
a nuclear reactor in siberia .
i took it an hour out of its way , tops .
okay , where is he ?
sheldon ? i just dropped him off at the comic book store . why ?
here . try and go online .
problem with the wifi ? just try .
greetings , hamburger toucher .
you are probably wondering
why you cannot im with your little friends
about how much you &quot; heart &quot; various things .
this recorded message is alerting you
that i am putting an end
to your parasitic piggybacking upon our wifi .
if you want to remedy the situation ,
you can contact the phone company ,
set up your own wifi and pay for it , or you may apologize to me .
well ?
i reiterate : knuckle under .
no , no , no , no , no . it is on .
i am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt .
oh , penny , you don &apos;t want to get into it
with sheldon .
the guy is one lab accident away
from being a supervillain .
i don &apos;t care . i was in junior rodeo .
i can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds .
no need to neuter the nerd .
i can get you back online .
there , see ? problem solved .
voil ?
sheldon : hello , puny insects .
as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will ,
everyone is awarded one additional strike .
thanks a lot , howard .
what are you complaining about ?
i &apos;m the one who has to take the class again .
hello .
time to do your laundry , huh ?
it &apos;s saturday night .
saturday is laundry night .
i know .
every saturday at 8 : 15 .
easy to anticipate .
what are you implying ?
i &apos;m implying that you &apos;re a creature of habit .
and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry
on saturday at 8 : 15,
you might find it ...
unpleasant .
knuckle under ? my ass .
oh , no , are all the machines taken ?
what are you gonna do ?
no problem .
i &apos;ll just do my laundry another night .
another night ?
well , i guess you can try ,
but deep inside your heart ,
you &apos;ll know that laundry night is always saturday night .
woman , you are playing with forces beyond your ken .
yeah , well , your ken can kiss my barbie .
sheldon . sheldon !
sheldon .
yes ?
where are my clothes ?
your clothes ? yes , i left them in the washers
and when i went down to get them , they were gone .
really ?
despite the sign that says &quot; do not leave laundry unattended &quot; ?
sheldon , where are my clothes ?
you know , i do recall seeing some female undergarments .
where was that ?
oh , yes ...
earlier this evening ,
i happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye .
do those look familiar ?
how the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire ?
when you understand the laws of physics , penny ,
anything is possible .
and may i add : mwuh @-@ ha @-@ ha .
get them down .
apologize . never .
well , then may i suggest you get a very long stick
and play panty pinata .
look , wait , sheldon , this has gotten out of hand , okay ?
i &apos;ve done some stupid things .
you &apos;ve done some stupid things .
how about we just call it even and move on with our lives ?
i &apos;ve done no stupid things .
look , you &apos;ve got to meet me halfway here .
i am meeting you halfway .
i &apos;m willing to concede that you &apos;ve done stupid things .
hey , you guys are talking again . good .
what happened ?
leonard , remember when i said it was on ?
well , now it &apos;s junior rodeo on .
oh , not junior rodeo .
what did you do ?
i had no choice , leonard .
she ruined laundry night .
mwuh @-@ ha @-@ ha .
telephone wires can &apos;t electrocute you , can they ?
no . look , this has to stop .
oh , no , no , no . it is just beginning .
all right , i really didn &apos;t want to do this , but ...
here .
what &apos;s this ?
sheldon &apos;s kryptonite .
oh , my god .
he can never know that i gave that to you .
look , i said i wanted to hurt him , but ...
but this ?
it &apos;ll shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives .
oh , pause it . that &apos;s it . confirmed .
we now have the address of the top model house .
god bless you , google street view registered trademark .
okay , for the record ,
what you &apos;re doing is really creepy .
you know what ? if it &apos;s &quot; creepy &quot;
to use the internet , military satellites , and robot aircraft
to find a house full of gorgeous young models
so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly ,
then fine , i &apos;m &quot; creepy . &quot;
hello .
oh , hi . yeah , hold on a second . i &apos;ll get him .
sheldon , it &apos;s for you .
who is it ? your mother .
oh , good .
hi , mom . how are you ?
but , mom ...
she keeps sitting in my spot .
and @-@ and she touched my food .
okay , yes , i took her clothes , but she started it ...
no , that &apos;s not fair .
why should i have to apologize ?
yeah , i really don &apos;t think this is the kind of thing
jesus concerns himself with .
no , you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t really know what jesus thinks about .
all right , good @-@ bye .
did you tell on me ?
are you kidding me ?
i already have two strikes .
penny . penny .
penny .
i am very , very sorry for what i have done .
here &apos;s your laundry .
i rescind your strikes
and you are no longer banished .
can i sit wherever i want ?
never mind , never mind .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s not important .
sheldon , this was big of you .
thank you . i really appreciate it .
thank you .
good night , sheldon .
penny ...
yes ?
well played .
thank you .
just remember : with great power comes great responsibility .
understood .
can i help you
yes , we here to fix the cable .
i think we have satellite .
that &apos;s what i meant .
oh . okay , come on in .
she &apos;s taller than all the women in my family combined .
what do we do now ?
