this is the best trauma unit in the tri @-@ state .
l &apos;m up on all the ratings .

tony , it &apos;s dr. rubin .
mr. moltisanti suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest . . .
. . .due to internal bleeding . he was resuscitated .
the bleeding was brought under control . he &apos;s in stable condition .
what was the duration of the arrest ?
about a minute .
he still intubated ?
they &apos;re removing the ventilator now .
what the fuck you two talking about ?
the worst is over . but he was clinically dead for about a minute .
doctor , can l go see him ?
no , he &apos;ll be in post @-@ op for about five hours .
then he &apos;s asked to speak with mr. gualtieri .
me ?
he asked for you and mr. soprano .
christopher .
hey .
l &apos;m sorry , t.
for what ?
l know you &apos;re mad at me .
what are you talking about ? l &apos;m not mad at you . nobody is .
l &apos;m going to hell , t.
you &apos;re not going anywhere but home .
l crossed over to the other side .
you what ?
l saw the tunnel . . .
. . .and a white light .
l saw my father in hell .
get the fuck outta here .
the bouncer said that l &apos;d be there too when my time comes .
what bouncer ?
the emerald piper .
that &apos;s our hell .
lt &apos;s an lrish bar where it &apos;s st. patrick &apos;s day every day forever .
mikey palmice and brendan filone were there too .
they were friends .
those two guys hated each other .
you gotta relax . you just need some rest .
they &apos;re friends now .
they were playing dice with two roman soldiers and a bunch of lrish guys .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
and the lrish , they were winning every roll .
and then mikey gave me a message for both of you .
a message .
yeah , he said :
&quot; tell tony and paulie , 3 : 00 . &quot;
three o &apos;clock ?
this fucking morphine drip. l don &apos;t think it &apos;s working .
l don &apos;t feel a fucking thing .
you gotta be careful with that .
that was all he said ?
who ?
mikey . three o &apos;clock ?
what was he wearing ?
come on , let &apos;s go . he needs his rest .
he had on a gangster suit .
pinstripe .
old @-@ fashioned style .
that was a dream .
forget about it . okay ?
l &apos;m gonna take you home soon .
do they know this kid likes his chemistry set too much ?
he &apos;s in pain . what the fuck else they gonna do ?
what time was mikey hit ?
how the fuck do l know ? you were there .
lt was in the morning , right ? eleven , ten ?
all right , so l cheat. l used to cheat .
l &apos;m not getting spayed . end of subject .
you brought up the vasectomy . now you don &apos;t want to talk .
you asked me what was going on .
l saw on the news about a gangland shooting .
ls that your nephew christopher that you &apos;ve spoken of before ?
the papers said he was in critical condition .
lt &apos;ll be fine .
have they found the person that shot him yet ?
no . have you ?
l &apos;m not trying to pry into that part of your life .
l know our deal .
but l &apos;ve heard you say before that you love this young man .
christopher was . . .
. . .clinically dead . . .
. . .for about a minute .
he thinks he had one of those near @-@ death experiences .
says he visited hell . . .
. . .and they told him he &apos;d be back permanent .
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
lt &apos;s bullshit. lt was a dream combined with the morphine .
he thinks he &apos;s going to hell . he &apos;s all fucked up over it .
do you think he &apos;ll go to hell ?
he &apos;s not the type that deserves hell .
who do you think does ?
the worst people .
the twisted and demented psychos who kill people for pleasure .
cannibals , degenerate molesters , torturers and killers of babies .
the hitlers , the pol pots . they &apos;re the evil fucks that deserve to die .
not my nephew .
what about you ?
what ?
hell ?
you been listening to me ?
no . for the same reasons .
we &apos;re soldiers , you know . soldiers don &apos;t go to hell .
lt &apos;s war . soldiers , they kill other soldiers .
we &apos;re in a situation . . .
. . .where everybody involved knows the stakes .
and if you &apos;re gonna accept those stakes . . .
. . .you gotta do certain things .
lt &apos;s business . we &apos;re soldiers .
we follow codes .
orders .
so does that justify everything that you do ?
excuse me . when america opened the floodgates . . .
. . .and let all us ltalians in , what do you think they did it for ?
because they were trying to save us from poverty ?
lt was because they needed us .
they needed us to build their cities and subways and to make them richer .
the carnegies and rockefellers needed worker bees . there we were .
but some of us didn &apos;t want to lose who we were .
we wanted to preserve the important things :
honor and family and loyalty .
some of us wanted a piece of the action .
now we weren &apos;t educated like the americans . . .
. . .but we had the balls to take what we wanted .
and those other fucks , those other , the j.p. morgans . . .
. . .they were crooks and killers too .
but that was the business , right ? the american way .
that might all be true .
but what do poor ltalian immigrants have to do with you . . .
. . .and what happens every morning you step out of bed ?
what the fuck is all this ?
l &apos;m just asking a question .
oh , so you &apos;re taking a stand here now . you pick here to make a stand ?
after all this , telling me nothing &apos;s my fault because of poor parenting . . .
. . .you pick now to be betsy @-@ fucking @-@ ross ?
my nephew &apos;s in the fucking hospital . he might not get out .
what ? three o &apos;clock again ?
quiet .
my wind chimes ?
sorry , hon .
just don &apos;t wake up my kids , paulie .
motherfucker .
baby . . .
. . .you gotta relax your thoughts .
whatever christopher saw . . .
. . .you can &apos;t take it personal .
christopher &apos;s a troubled kid .
who knows what &apos;s in his heart ?
come .
you &apos;re right. l need to relax with this .
let me help you .
that is so weird .
what the fuck you saying ?
three o &apos;clock ?
kenny and l were supposed to be married at 1 : 00 . . .
. . .in the fontainebleau room at the roman gardens .
mikey and jo @-@ jo had the bella vista room booked for 3 : 00 .
the bella vista room is smaller with no windows .
a week before the wedding , mikey saw the bella vista room and flipped out .
he almost killed the events manager .
so mikey and jo @-@ jo got the fontainebleau . . .
. . .and kenny and me wound up with the bella vista room .
at 3 : 00 .
fuck .
just trying to tidy up the place . go back to sleep .
tidying up ?
how you doing ?
l &apos;m doing .
l &apos;ll tell you . . .
. . .l &apos;m still baffled by this 3 : 00 thing , though .
l wish l had more for you , but that &apos;s all he said .
let me ask you a question .
yeah ?
that bouncer that sent you back , did he have horns on his head ?
no
he was just some big lrish goon in old @-@ fashioned clothes .
did anybody there have horns ?
or buds for horns ? those goat bumps ?
paulie , it was fucking hell , okay ?
my father said he loses every hand of cards he plays .
and every midnight , they whack him . . .
. . .the same way he was whacked in life , and it &apos;s painful .
night after night . does that sound like fucking heaven to you ?
was it hot ?
yeah .
l don &apos;t know . what the fuck ?
heat &apos;s the first thing you &apos;d notice . hell is hot .
that &apos;s never been disputed by anybody .
you didn &apos;t go to hell . you went to purgatory , my friend .
l forgot all about purgatory .
purgatory .
a little detour on the way to paradise .
how long you think we stay there ?
now that &apos;s different for everybody .
you add up all your mortal sins and multiply that number by 50 .
then you add up all your venial sins and multiply that by 25 .
you add them together , that &apos;s your sentence .
l figure l have to do about 6000 years before l get accepted into heaven .
and 6000 years is nothing in eternity terms .
l can do that standing on my head .
lt &apos;s like a couple of days here .
was l insensitive ?
and , perhaps , did l do it deliberately ?
do l hate him ?
how often are you taking the ativan ?
almost every night .
and when else ?
sunday afternoon l took one .
there &apos;s another thing. l--
l &apos;ve been drinking .
alone .
l &apos;m glad you &apos;re telling me .
part of it is that l &apos;m afraid .
l &apos;ve told him my son is at bard .
why did you agree to continue working with him ?
we &apos;ve discussed this , elliot .
l took him back because l felt it was . . .
. . .a professional and ethical responsibility to do so .
jennifer , l &apos;m not challenging your ability or professionalism . . .
. . .or even your ethics .
then what are you challenging ?
what you hope to achieve with this man .
what do you hope to achieve with me ?
no , that &apos;s a facile analogy .
l &apos;m living in a moral never never land with this patient .
not wanting to judge but to treat .
but now l &apos;ve judged .
l took a position , goddamn it , and l &apos;m scared .
l feel for you .
you &apos;re late .
that go on my record ?
lt &apos;s common courtesy. l got a life too .
yeah , lucky you .
so , what do you got ?
l think he knows .
knows what ?
or suspects .
what are you talking about ?
he looks at me different . glances .
&quot; glances &quot; ?
we had sandwiches brought in .
four with meats , one eggplant and the other with tomato and mozzarella .
that &apos;s six . there were only five of us .
tony said he ordered the eggplant , but l did . he ordered the tomato .
maybe he forgot .
he never forgets .
what &apos;s your point ?
he let me eat the eggplant . he took the tomato .
but there was a moment .
a glance .
yeah , a fucking glance !
this is simple. l &apos;m gonna help you out .
keep in mind that you &apos;re the one who &apos;s different .
you &apos;re seeing differently . you got a new attitude .
l know the man . he &apos;s the one who &apos;s different with me .
odds don &apos;t favor it . either way , it doesn &apos;t matter .
yeah , to you .
l wasn &apos;t the one selling heroin .
l wasn &apos;t the one pinched for it .
so , what do l do ?
what do you do ?
you do everything you can do .
do what you do to a girl that you want to fuck . make him love you .
l &apos;ll be back first thing in the morning .
what do you want for breakfast ?
you don &apos;t wake up till lunch , mom .
tomorrow l &apos;ll get up early .
how about the peppers and eggs and bread ?
that sounds great , ma .
okay .
do you need more time alone , jo ?
no. l &apos;m ready .
bye , ma .
lf you want to sleep , it &apos;s okay. l brought a book .
no , l just got up 1.0 minutes ago .
and the painkillers aren &apos;t helping ?
no , they &apos;re pretty fucking good .
l want to tell you something , christopher .
the other night , when your heart stopped . . .
. . .l walked down the hall to a room and l prayed to jesus to spare you .
and that if he would spare you , l asked that he grant you vision .
sight .
so that you can see the way to christ clearly .
yeah , so ?
and he did spare you .
and you saw , christopher .
you saw something .
something that none of us have ever seen .
so , what did he say to you ?
who ?
jesus .
l didn &apos;t see jesus .
tony said you saw jesus and he took you to see your father in heaven .
then he said it wasn &apos;t your time .
l was in hell .
you what ?
my father was in hell and they said that &apos;s where l &apos;d go when it &apos;s my time .
maybe it was purgatory , but l don &apos;t know .
then you have to look at this experience as a chance to repent .
to change your heart .
to start to walk in the light of the lord . you were blessed by this .
you were blessed with a second chance .
l don &apos;t know , carmela .
well , l do know .
and l am gonna pray like l did the other night .
and l &apos;m gonna pray every day from now on .
lt is not too late for you , christopher .
lf you pray .
will you pray ?
okay , you just have to follow me .
ln the name of the father . . .
. . .the son . . .
. . .and the holy spirit .
how was he ?
fine .
same .
so any news ?
no .
so , what , we &apos;re not talking now ?
l said what l had to say , tony .
lf you can &apos;t be honest with me , have the balls to be honest with yourself .
l got balls . and as long as l do , they will remain intact .
you don &apos;t have faith in me , it &apos;s up to you .
you gotta prove it to yourself first . yourself and god .
you &apos;re only religious when it suits you .
what is that supposed to mean ?
come here .
what &apos;s it mean ?
the pope don &apos;t like trojans yet you want me cut. lsn &apos;t that hypocritical ?
look , l &apos;m thinking of my family first . that &apos;s all .
what &apos;s down here is god &apos;s creation. lsn &apos;t it a sin to undo his work ?
you should know . you made a living of it .
you &apos;re un @-@ fucking @-@ believable , you know that ?
look what l made that living for .
you had dinner an hour ago . what the fuck are you doing to yourself ! ?
leave him alone .

and l &apos;m going home to sleep. l don &apos;t need to keep everyone up .
come on . let &apos;s go to sleep .
come talk to me .
how much can you believe in dreams ?
wait . wrong .
christopher did not have a dream .
a dream , l &apos;d make my peace .
he was dead .
science said he was dead . science .
you need to talk to someone who deals with this professionally .
what kind of thing ?
he &apos;s in new york , paulie .
ln nyack .
his name &apos;s cullen , a psychic .
get the fuck outta here .
he &apos;s famous for contacting dead relatives for people .
he contacted my dead friend . remember ronnie with the arm ?
he knew about the fingers at the elbow , and l didn &apos;t tell him .
he said , &quot; johnny is here . &quot; l told him l didn &apos;t know any johnnies .
but then he said , &quot; well , one arm is shorter than the other .
does that mean anything to you ? &quot;
ronnie. lt was ronnie .
jesus . a fucking creep show .
you got nothing to lose except the nightmares .

my father .
l understand now . you &apos;re gregory . this is your son .

because l got this image of daniel in the lion &apos;s den .
he says you found his body .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s sorry . he knows how traumatic that was .
he couldn &apos;t take the pain anymore .
gregory , l &apos;m sorry . could you repeat that ?
he wants you to know . . .
. . .that he was there with you and that you should move on .
yes , go ahead .
what &apos;s the problem ?

satanic black magic . sick shit .
l &apos;m asking you to leave , sir .
fucking queers !
when l made my appointment l gave the name ted hughes .
did you call him from your house ?
l &apos;m not a moron , t.
l knew this might be a scam . . .
. . .so l called him from a pathmark .
there &apos;s no denying it .
l &apos;m dragging a bunch of fucking ghouls around with me .
and mikey &apos;s their fucking ringleader .
paulie , think about it .
you whacked a lot of heavy hitters .
you think they &apos;d join together and follow that prick ?
how can you just sit there ?
he warned you about 3 : 00 too .
l don &apos;t believe any of this. lt doesn &apos;t mean a fucking thing to me .
t , l was ready to write the whole thing off . . .
. . .until this psychic mentioned little sonny pagano .
but that ? l don &apos;t know .
l did this guy over 30 years ago . how the fuck did he know that ?
did you ask the fucking ghostbuster where matt bevilaqua is ?
we &apos;re breaking our ass trying to find him . . .
. . .and you &apos;re up there fucking around in nyack .
he deals only with the dead .
you eat steak ?

ln lndia , you &apos;d go to hell for that .
l &apos;m not in lndia . what do l give a fuck ?
that &apos;s what l &apos;m saying . none of this shit means a goddamn thing .
l &apos;m not hungry .
you mind if l eat in here ?
l &apos;m sorry for talking to you the way l did .
lt &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
l was wrong .
l hope you know l didn &apos;t mean it .
l said it because all the anger and the frustration . . .
. . .of the last few days had built up inside me and exploded .
there &apos;s no excuse for that .
l gotta learn to control my emotions around the people l love .
l think you &apos;re the same way. l think . . .
. . .your feelings , you keep inside .
and you and me , we react without thinking .
so l get mad at you , you know ? l see myself in you .
l couldn &apos;t ask for a better son , aj .
and l mean that .

twenty @-@ three years of donations . . .
. . .and this guy sees this hanging over me ?
you shouldn &apos;t have seen a psychic. lt &apos;s divination , the devil . . .
. . .and completely unsanctioned by the church .
psychics are heretics and thieves who practice witchcraft .
there &apos;s no validity to anything he told you .
your problem &apos;s a spiritual matter .
maybe .
but irregardless , l should &apos;ve had immunity to all of this shit .
l should have been covered by my donations .
when the organ needed a reed job , who was there ?
when the priests and altar boys needed new whites , who picked up the tab ?
you should &apos;ve come to me first . this wouldn &apos;t have happened .
but don &apos;t worry , paul. l &apos;m here. l can help you .
lt &apos;s too late . you been slacking off on me .
you left me unprotected. l &apos;m cutting you off for good .
you ain &apos;t never gonna see another dime from me .
a rich man and a poor man got the same anniversary .
