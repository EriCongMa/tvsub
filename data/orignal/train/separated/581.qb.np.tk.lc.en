by the end of world war ii , president roosevelt &apos;s body
had finally succumbed to the polio
that afflicted him his entire life .
which brings me to the yalta conference .
who can tell me three key points brought up there ?
annie .
the demilitarization of germany--
i &apos;m sorry .
annie kim .
the demilitarization of germany ,
the establishment of poland &apos;s borders
and the formation of the united nations .
sidenote : the results of yalta
would later set the stage for the cold war .
oh , boy , spoiler alert .
somebody just won a ride in the wheelchair .
i &apos;m proud of you for deciding on a major , britta .
i &apos;d like to thank the lord in my prayers about you ,
but you &apos;re still dressing like a streetwalker .
yep , i &apos;m getting serious .
i got a backpack , i got a new notebook .
oh , i got one of those see @-@ through yellow pens
so i can do that thing where you color in the words .
highlight ?
probably the backpack .
free the damascus three .
oh , thanks . oh , whoa .
i know this girl .
we used to protest together all the time
and now she &apos;s locked up in syria .
oh , that &apos;s terrible .
yes , it &apos;s terrible .
she &apos;s imprisoned by an oppressive regime
halfway around the world and i &apos;m , what ?
in college ?
where are my values ?
man , she &apos;s got a facebook group ?
my first cop flashlight .
can &apos;t wait to get some brains on this bad boy .
are you safe , ma &apos;am ? everything okay ?
is this guy bothering you ?
who the hell do you think you are ?
the badge says to serve and protect !
no , it doesn &apos;t .
&quot; how &apos;s my smile ? &quot; oh , man .
what the hell am i in charge of ?
see this garbage can ?
students coming out of the library bump into it .
you can serve and protect them from a nasty boo @-@ boo .
what do i do if i see a crime ?
what a security guard does--
call a cop .
where &apos;d you even get these ?
come on , let me keep them .
no .
please ? i swear they &apos;re just for sex !
and this ragtag group of cutups
is my study group .
gang , this is annie kim from my poli @-@ sci class .
we just figured out we had the same g.p.a. in high school .
well , mine was higher if you consider my school &apos;s ranking .
well , it sounds like you had a lighter course load , so .
well , i was in a lot of clubs .
i founded 17 of them .
well , i was actually thinking about founding a model u.n.
here at greendale . any interest ?
i &apos;ll probably be busy ,
and you probably need to study ,
so see you in class .
okay , goodbye .
wow , annie .
how progressive of you to have a multicultural evil twin .
an asian annie .
obama &apos;s america .
her name is annie kim ,
and she &apos;s not evil .
she &apos;s my friend .
didn &apos;t look like it .
yeah , you seemed pretty competitive with her .
you be careful , annie . they are ruthless .
what ?
what ? not asians .
women .
i &apos;m not competing with he .
i find her adorable .
she &apos;s like a younger me .
you mean the younger you that took so much adderall
she tried to straighten the lines on our high school
football field during a game ?
ooh , be caful annie .
you don &apos;t want this little girl
to suck you back to the dark side .
hey , guys , what &apos;re you trying to do here ?
this is our annie .
that little twerp is a can of annie lite .
she couldn &apos;t hold a candle to the real thing
in any category of anything .
aw , well , i wasn &apos;t fishing for that .
you &apos;re the best , kiddo .
you know what else was the best ?
the rainforests .
too bad the fascist oligarchies are raping them
to make hamburgers . look it up .
looks like someone woke up on the regular side of the bed .
britta &apos;s just having a rough time
because her friend &apos;s in prison .
i went to her facebook page .
it says she was tear @-@ gassed and possibly beaten .
i haven &apos;t been tear @-@ gassed in so long .
well , you &apos;re on a new path now .
oh , goody , a new path .
is it lined with credit cards and flat screen tvs ?
does it go by an ikea ?
maybe i don &apos;t want a new path !
or any path .
maybe my path is a war path
that leads to the terrordome , n @-@ words !
okay , maybe i went too far .
maybe i don &apos;t want to offend my african @-@ american friends ,
but the larger point is ,
maybe i &apos;m not done raging against the machine .
raging against the what ?
that sounds dangerous .
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll be bad at it .
keep clear of the can .
sir , step around the can .
mind the can , student .
you just got yourself a warning .
i piss warnings , pig .
and that &apos;s how we do that .
i got my eye on you , missy .
顾问老师 : 克里格斯教授
you okay , kiddo ?
yeah , yeah . you know what &apos;s funny ?
this is so silly .
remember little annie kim from poli @-@ sci ?
boy , she just ... took my model u.n. idea
and just ...
she is quite the little go @-@ getter .
wait , what ?
she stole your idea ?
sneak attack .
that &apos;s just like--
not women , asians .
well , the real important thing is that there is a model u.n.
it doesn &apos;t really matter who starts it .
it just means her name goes on some charter
and she gets to put it on her resume .
and lead the greendale team to the national model u.n. ,
and meet kofi annan , boutros boutros ghali ,
and will.i.am.
boutros boutros ghali ?
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m gonna find this little brat &apos;s off @-@ switch .
jeff !
he &apos;s just being protective .
i &apos;ll stop him .
i am so excited that we finally have
a model u.n. here at greendale .
i am really , really , really ,
really , really , really into model u.n.s.
they used to call me model u.n. guy back in college .
well , that &apos;s not-- don &apos;t research that .
the important thing here is that i am really--
pardon me , professor cligoris .
cligoris ?
either pronunciation is fine ? are you here for the model u.n. ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that the entire idea
to have a model u.n. was hers .
really ? so you &apos;re clark m. eichelburger .
so i &apos;ve had your photo around my neck since i was in high school .
i &apos;m talking about the greendale model u.n.
my annie gave this other annie the idea
and the diabolical little b--usybody
stabbed her in the back .
it &apos;s childish .
honestly i &apos;m just happy there is a model u.n.
annie , is this true ?
i recall other annie mentioned the concept ,
but she certainly didn &apos;t take the initiative
to find a faculty advisor .
i didn &apos;t know that all you had to do was call dibs .
i &apos;m not calling dibs .
because i &apos;m not a petty
competitive child that steals ideas .
i simply refuse to acknowledge the authority
of your criminal model u.n.
so don &apos;t recognize it .
it still exists .
oh , then annie &apos;ll just start her own model u.n.
yeah , for grown @-@ ups .
well , i still don &apos;t recognize it .
well , it exists , baby !
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t understand your relationship here .
is he your father or your lover ?
there can only be one model u.n.
that officially represents this school
so let &apos;s take our foot off the crazy pedal
for just a moment here .
there &apos;s only one rational way to settle this .
a head @-@ to @-@ head model u.n. battle royale ,
the rules to which i would have to spend the evening devising .
we &apos;ll have the competition tomorrow
in the cafeteria at 7 : 00 p.m.
may the most united nations win .
fair enough .
totally fair .
i &apos;ll see you in the fair papers , other annie .
oh , and you were asking what our relationship is ?
we &apos;re friends .
yeah .
good friends .
grown @-@ up friends .
yeah .
so .
we &apos;re friendly .
so , the key win this thing is
when in doubt , agree with annie .
that &apos;s sweet , jeff .
but everyone should just have fun .
then again , what &apos;s more fun than winning ?
pierce .
i &apos;m offended you would single me out .
did you read up on your country &apos;s info @-@ packet ?
yes .
somalia has 1,900 miles of coastline ,
a government that knows its place ,
and all the guns and wives you can afford to buy .
why have i never heard of this paradise before ?
i studied up on my country .
is it okay if we do accents , sugar ?
troy , georgia the country , not the state .
that &apos;s right . capital city tbilisi ,
and former member of the soviet union .
and we kindly request y &apos;all mind your ps and qs .
welcome to the world &apos;s first ever model u.n. off .
you will each be scored on your u.n. &apos; s ability
to pass resolutions , follow procedure , and maintain order .
the end goal , of course , total world peace .
any questions ?
does two u.n.s mean there are two earths ?
uh , yeah . sure , two earths .
parallel earths in different galaxies
or identical earths in parallel dimensions ?
the latter one .
well , what does that say about free will ?
abed ! professor--
right , yeah , let &apos;s begin .
ready , set ,
peace .
crisis alert .
a civil war has broken out in ethiopia .
rebel forces have seized the grain supply ,
creating a humanitarian disaster .
okay , cool heads , everyone .
america proposes a u.n. peacekeeping force of
10,000 troops .
uruguay agrees .
ooh , uh , china , too .
georgia--the country-- is much obliged .
there &apos;s gonna be refugees . who can take refugees ?
the great country of somalia .
this gem , this shangri @-@ la
graciously invites the ethiopian refugees
to enjoy safe lodging and cool ocean breezes
on its sand @-@ swept beaches .
okay , we &apos;re rolling .
switzerland proposes a peace summit .
good idea , switzerland .
and maybe at the peace summit we can discuss the possibility
of opening a portal to earth ii .
can we put a pin in that , switzerland ?
earth ii is out there , can &apos;t ignore it forever .
well , china has money . does anybody want some ?
yes ! the united states proposes using china &apos;s money
to fund agricultural programs
to support ethiopia &apos;s sustainable farms .
which should promote economic development and security .
all in favor ?
it &apos;s unanimous .
good resolving , blue u.n.
you really covered all the bases .
we have a unanimous decision as well .
then after one round , we are tied .
looks like both u.ns are experts at fostering unity .
crap .
damn it .
crisis alert . russia ...
this is what the united nations
is doing to your freedom .
i &apos;m your freedom ! and i &apos;m in a cage .
with the world !
because of them !
i thought i &apos;d find you here .
what are you gonna do , lock me up ?
just give me a reason .
i &apos;ll give you a reason !
that &apos;s it , you &apos;re coming with me .
he &apos;s pulling my cage .
i &apos;m being pulled in my cage for no reason !
is anybody seeing this ?
is the world seeing this ? are we facebooking this ?

massive--

the tropical paradise of somalia graciously yields .
china will pay .
gooder than grits .
switzerland is very concerned about earth ii .
uruguay agrees .
uruguay sounds like &quot; you &apos;re a gay . &quot;
backyard barbecue !
uruguay kindly requests that
somalia stop pronouncing it &quot; you &apos;re a gay . &quot;
hereditary monarchy !
resolved .
graft and corruption .
resolved .
crisis alert !
resolved .
looking good , blue u.n.
getting very close to world peace .
that &apos;s my girl . you are kicking ass .
all right , guys ,
this is the home stretch . all we gotta do is focus .
oh ! damn , pierce .
ooh , that wasn &apos;t me .
i don &apos;t smell anything-- whup , i just got it .
oh , it &apos;s in my mouth .
guys , come on , focus .
like adults .
we &apos;re gonna lose a point if we don &apos;t get through this .
get through it ? it &apos;s almost a solid .
crisis alert .
a genocidal dictator in laos--
yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll get to that .
okay , so , looking at turkey , what can you do ?
so let me get this straight .
you &apos;re bringing her in here
for &quot; making a mess . &quot;
i did more than make a mess .
i turned your whole system inside out .
and i shut her down .
young lady , you spilled paint on a globe .
you &apos;re as much a criminal as this idiot is a cop .
none whatsoever .
okay , but , um , she &apos;s going to do something illegal .
aren &apos;t you ?
is that true ? do you , britta perry ,
have any intentions of breaking any laws ever ?
i @-@ i-
oh , my god .
no , it &apos;s not that simple .
i have a life now .
i have a major and--
get out please .
i have highlighters .
get out !
okay , i know you &apos;ve got a lot on your mind right now .
but somebody broke that thing
that comes down from the parking booth .
you know the thing that comes down ,
keeps the ... cars from coming in .
the thing . it &apos;s like a gate , but it &apos;s just a stick .
comes down , from a hinge .
keeps the cars out .
goes up and down 90 degrees .
the arm ?
ooh , point goes to red team .
how is this still happening ?
i can &apos;t remember what regular air smells like .
do something or we &apos;re gonna lose .
guys , this is important to annie .
so whoever actually died a few months ago , &apos; fess up
so we can put a stake through your heart .
jeff !
annie , i think the real lesson here is
that a model u.n. , much like the real u.n. ,
quickly falls apart when faced with actual--
i think the lesson here is that i need to win this !
i want to win !
and you !
you suck ! you &apos;re a stupid , ugly poopface !
i &apos;m better than you !
annie , stop .
you &apos;re acting like a little schoolgirl
and not in a hot way .
okay .
uh , that made me sound creepy .
but--but here &apos;s the thing .
don &apos;t look at me .
if embarrassment were bountiful zinc deposits ,
i &apos;d be zambia .
there &apos;s nothing to be zambia about , annie .
this is all my fault .
i pushed you into competing with other annie .
are you kidding me ?
i practically ran to you with that flier .
i wanted to destroy her .
all because i can &apos;t handle the thought
of anyone getting more gold stars than me .
i &apos;m such a child .
you &apos;re not .
listen , when you really hate someone
the way you hate annie kim ,
or when you feel the way i feel about you ,
the easy loophole through the creepiness and danger
is to treat them like a child .
&quot; a chip off the old block , you &apos;re the best , kiddo . &quot;
it &apos;s a crutch .
it &apos;s a way for me to tell you how important you are
from a distance .
but now you &apos;re becoming this ...
mature , self @-@ possessed , intelligent young woman ,
and i can &apos;t keep patting you on the head
or talking down to you .
but i like how close we are .
i don &apos;t want to grow up if it means losing what we have .
well , tough , annie .
you have to grow up
because the world needs more women like you .
can &apos;t keep doing this forever , kiddo .
can &apos;t we ?
nope . i can &apos;t , no .
nope , that &apos;s gross .
that feels gross .
well , i better go check on the group .
if they haven &apos;t left already .
i &apos;ll follow you .
from a respectable distance .
guys ?
i &apos;m sorry i put you through that .
and i know it doesn &apos;t make up for what happened ,
but would it help if i said
i farted ?
annie , no .
i can &apos;t let you fall on that sword because ...
i farted .
no , i farted .
i farted .
guys , i wasn &apos;t doing the spartacus thing .
i farted .
no , seriously , i--
we all farted .
oh , you guys !
annie ... i &apos;m farting now .
wait , why are you still here ?
abed may have figured out a way we can still win .
really ? how ?
it &apos;s simple , really . first we ...
abed , what did i tell you ?
you can &apos;t just mumble nonsense .
no one &apos;s cutting away .
okay , fine , here &apos;s my actual plan .
what is that ?
it &apos;s from britta .
she &apos;s promising to disrupt the model ... u.n.
she says she &apos;s gonna cause a disruption that ,
while not completely illegal , should be a real concern
to campus ... security !
oh , no .
maybe we should call the real cops .
you know , back in the &apos; 80s ,
i had this real piece of work protestor ,
used to always give me trouble .
you know what happened to her ?
she incited a riot at the w.t.o.
got choked until she passed out .
by some real cop with a real billyclub .
sometimes i wonder , you know ?
well , what are you waiting for ?
go show that hippie how the world really works .
aren &apos;t you forgetting something ?
all in favor ?
could you morons say aye any slower ? come on .
greetings , people of earth ii .
what is this ?
we represent the united nations from earth i.
using our switzerland &apos;s hadron collider
and resources from every nation ,
the people of our planet have constructed
a trans @-@ dimensional gateway here .
they can &apos;t do this .
the science works out .
yes .
we come to you with an offer .
we have achieved world peace , tying our score with yours .
but we are willing to concede our victory
if you agree conceding yours ,
forming one gigantic united united nations .
we did it .
you &apos;re a fool .
your ultimatum is itself a technical act of aggression .
if we simply refuse to recognize your authority ,
we still remain ahead and you lose .
but you win a simple game .
the larger symbolic victory will be ours .
we refuse .
i &apos;ll take the real victory .
a logical , effective , common sense move , annie kim .
one which flies in the very face of the united nations itself ,
a fundamentally symbolic organization
founded on the principles of high @-@ minded rhetoric
and empty gestures .
blue u.n. wins .
what the hell are you doing ?
nothing .
and you can &apos;t do anything to stop me .
did someone say &quot; can &apos;t do anything &quot; ?
i knew you &apos;d come .
you &apos;re so busted .
i told you to stop playing operation on me !
i &apos;m not your damn board game !
