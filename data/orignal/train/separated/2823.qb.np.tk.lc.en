&quot; chip &quot; is chip matthews .

why &apos;s he calling you ?
because i ran into him at the bank . he is still so cute .

i know !
chip ? hi , it &apos;s monica .
okey , okey ...
okey ...
okey , goodbye
oh , my god ! we just had the best conversation !
i was just leaving .

i &apos;ve got a report to read .
it &apos;s eight pages . i hope i don &apos;t fall asleep .
why ? did you write it ?
look at that !
chip matthews called . i wonder what he wants .
well , actually ....
i bet he sensed that i was ready to have sex with another guy .
why don &apos;t you give him a call ?
okey
are you sure you want to hear this ?
i &apos;m sure .
chip ! hi , it &apos;s rachel .
rachel greene .
you left me a message ?
yes , you did . my roommate wrote it down .
monica geller ?
oh , that &apos;s right !
he called to ask out monica .
that &apos;s got to be embarrassing .
dumb drunken bitch
thank you !
here &apos;s a question .
where &apos;d you get the &quot; finest oak east of the mississippi &quot; ?
first tell us where you got the prettiest lace in the land .
it &apos;s your ad .
looks good ?
&quot; stunning entertainment center , fine
fine ltalian craftsmanship . &quot;
you &apos;re selling the entertainment center ?
why ? i love it .
you want it ? -no .
no
gepetto ?
five thousand dollars ?
are you insane ?
the ad alone cost $ 300 .
i &apos;m changing it to $ 50 or your best offer .
what kind of profit is that ? and you call yourself an accountant ?
no ...
what do you do ?
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t know .
i actually don &apos;t know .
oh , my god , no ! shoo , kitty !
there &apos;s a kitty in my guitar case .
everyone &apos;s gonna want one .
come on , you !
crazy !
oh , my god !
what ?
nothing .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just ...
i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother .
the mom you met in montauk ?
she was a cat ?
that makes the fact that she owns beach @-@ front property all the more impressive .
no . she was a human lady .
this is the spirit of my mom , lilly . the one that killed herself .
have you been taking your grandmother &apos;s glaucoma medicine again ?
no , dr. skeptismo .
i &apos;m sure . first of all , there &apos;s the feeling .
and for another , she went into my guitar case ...
... which is lined with orange felt .
my mother &apos;s favorite fish was orange roughy .
cats like fish .
you had me with orange felt .
hi , mommy !
i haven &apos;t seen this smile in 17 years .
phoebe &apos;s mom &apos;s got a huge pair of
let it go !
when were you going to tell me that you &apos;re dating chip ?
now ?
can i go out with him ?
no . i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d want to after what he did to me .
that thing at the prom ?
i couldn &apos;t find him for hours ! he was having sex with amy welsh !
that was in high school . how can it still bother you ?
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right , moni @-@ cow .
okay , i hear you .
why do you have to go out with chip ?
we went to different schools .
we went to the same school .
you went to one where you were popular .
you rode on chip &apos;s motorcycle and wore his letterman jacket .
i went to one where i wore a band uniform that was specially made .
they had that specially made ?
it was a home ec project .
oh , my god ! they said it was for the mascot .
back then i thought that i &apos;d never get to go out with a chip matthews .
now he &apos;s called me up and asked me out .
the fat girl inside me really wants to go . i owe her this .
i never let her eat .
you go out with him .
really ?
if possible , could you leave him and have sex with another guy ?
i &apos;ll try .
any luck getting rid of the entertainment center ?
there were a couple calls , but they won &apos;t work out .
joey has a very careful screening process .
not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails .
stop it !
she keeps trying to get away . just like when she was alive .
how long is your mom going to be with us ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i guess until she gets used to the fact that there &apos;s ...
... a new mom .
now she &apos;s worried that she &apos;ll be replaced .
that &apos;s not going to happen , is it ?
i have to go make a call .
why not use this phone ?
i &apos;m returning a call from a certain mom at the .
i just spelled the wrong word .
anyway , i don &apos;t want to do it in front of someone with a tail .
hey , you swore you would never tell .
so am i crazy , or does phoebe &apos;s mom remind anyone else of a cat ?
ross , don &apos;t start .
you actually believe there &apos;s a woman inside that cat ?
i believe it .
no , you don &apos;t .
yes , i do .
no , you
you know what ?
you won &apos;t suck me into this .
sure i will . because you always have to be right .
i do not always have okay , okay .
jurassic park could happen .
and you know what ? actually , i do think kirk was smarter than spock .
you were kidding about the kirk @-@ spock @-@ thing , though , right ?
that &apos;s pretty nice .
&quot; pretty nice &quot; ?
pardon my roommate . he wanted to marry this .
we don &apos;t have $ 50 . but would you trade for it ?
we got a canoe .
i don &apos;t think we need a canoe .
you got to take it .
just take the entertainment center .
then when you get home , throw the canoe away .
we &apos;re not throwing it away . i built it .
good for you !
you won &apos;t believe what i found on a telephone pole .
look familiar ?
apparently phoebe &apos;s mother also goes by the name &quot; julio . &quot;
wait a minute . this is not the same cat . this cat &apos;s only this big .
a little girl &apos;s looking for this cat . know what that means ?
yeah ! $ 200 reward split five ways !
do we have to tell her ?
yes , we do .
but it &apos;s made her so happy .
little girl misses her cat .
crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat .
i have to go have dinner with my son .
can i trust that when you see phoebe , you will tell her ?
yeah
thank you .
i hate when ross is right .
he is right , isn &apos;t he ?
this might be one time when he &apos;s wrong .
you think ?
oh , no . he &apos;s right .
about your mom .
how &apos;s that going ?
so great . we took a nap together today .
mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred .
that &apos;s so sweet .
i &apos;m gonna get some coffee .
what &apos;d you say , joe ? i &apos;ll be right there .
i just feel so ....
all right !
i &apos;m coming already !
not yet , not yet , not yet !
hello , chip .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m great !
got a great job . i have wonderful friends .
though i &apos;m not seeing anyone now , i &apos;ve never felt better about myself .
so , monica ready yet ?
she &apos;ll be out in a second .
so , chip , how &apos;s amy welsh ?
amy welsh ? i haven &apos;t seen her since
so , monica about ready ?
wow , you look great .
thanks .
well , you guys have fun .
catch you later.-bye , chip .
are you sure you &apos;re okay about this ?
actually ... okay , great .
this is the unit for you .
sturdy construction , tons of storage .
some big enough to fit a grown man .
what ?
yeah , i got in there myself once .
my roommate bet me $ 5 i couldn &apos;t .
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in .
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin .
no , you can &apos;t fit in there . it &apos;s not deep enough .
oh , yeah ?
if i can &apos;t ...
... i &apos;ll knock $ 5 off the price .
all right , you have yourself a deal .
see ? i told you .
sometimes i come in here just to get away from it .
hey , a nickel !
here we are .
you still have the chipper !
the what ?
that &apos;s what we called your motorcycle in high school .
a motorcycle &apos;s a chopper .
and you &apos;re chip .
never mind .
i think it &apos;s cute .
a lipper from chipper .
are you still in touch with anyone ?
there &apos;s rachel ...
... and that &apos;s it . how about you ?
i still hang with simens and zana . i see spindler , levine , kelly .
i run into goldie ...
... stick , brown , sulkov , mcguire ...
... j.t. , beardsley .
is that all ?
after high school , you kind of lose touch .
i ran into richard dorfman .
how is he ? -me and simens gave him a wedgie .
isn &apos;t he an architect ?
they still wear underwear .
oh , my god !
what ?
are you all right ?
what happened ?
oh , man , he promised he wouldn &apos;t take the chairs !
how were you locked in ? where the hell is all of our stuff ?
this guy came by to look at the unit ...
... and he said it won &apos;t fit a grown man .
so you got in voluntarily ?
i was trying to make a sale !
if i ever run into him , you know what i &apos;ll do ?
bend over ?
and then zana just let one rip !
not that i don &apos;t enjoy talking about high school ...
... because i do .
maybe we can talk about something else .
i don &apos;t know where you work .
you know where i work .
i do ?
the movie theater . you used to come in all the time .
still at the multiplex ?
like i &apos;d give up that job !
free popcorn and candy anytime i want ?
i can get you posters .
thanks , i &apos;m set .
oh , you know who came in the other night ? peters .
told me he just went out with leslie maskin . got to third base .
do you still live with your parents ?
yeah , but i can stay out as late as i want .
you know , with all of our stuff gone , the unit doesn &apos;t seem that big .
why couldn &apos;t he have been a kidnapper .
they really got you guys . your tv , the chairs .
your microwave , the stereo .
man , he took the five of spades !
no , here it is .
oh , my god ! what happened ?
joey was born , and then 28 years later , i was robbed !
so how was your date ?
well , i always wanted to go out with chip in high school .
tonight , i actually went out with chip in high school .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
not only did i get to go out with chip ...
... i got to dump chip .
that &apos;s so great !
i know .
what did the insurance company say ?
they said , &quot; you don &apos;t have insurance . stop calling us . &quot;
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
okay , fine .
pheebs
listen ...
... this cat belongs to a little girl .
there are flyers all over the place .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
we can take her back with you if you want .
but , you know , she chose to find me .
i have to respect her decision , right ?
that &apos;s a good call .
that &apos;s right .
enough is enough .
i &apos;m sorry you feel guilty about spending time with your new mom .
but this isn &apos;t your old mom .
this is a cat .
julio the cat .
not mom ! cat .
ross , how many parents have you lost ?
none .
then you don &apos;t know how it feels when one of them comes back .
i believe this is my mother .
even if i &apos;m wrong , who cares ?
just be a friend , okay ? be supportive .
i &apos;m sorry.okay.
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you could say ... you &apos;re sorry to her mom .
i think she would like that .
come here . here , come here .
mrs. buffay ?
sorry about what i said .
it was insensitive of me to say ...
... that you were just a cat ...
... when , clearly , you are also ...
... the reincarnated spirit ...
... of my friend &apos;s mother .
thank you .
we both forgive you .
what will you do about the little girl ?
listen .
mom , i hope you know you still mean a lot to me .
you &apos;re welcome to come back anytime .
pheebs
if she &apos;d come back as a couch , we &apos;d really appreciate it .
come on . i &apos;ll take you home .
i &apos;ll go with you .
me too .
i got an extra futon .
dude , you don &apos;t have to brag . we got nothing here .
