damon &apos;s gone !
i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was a monster .
that &apos;s my girlfriend ivy .
somebody killed her last night right in front of me ,
killing enzo won &apos;t bring her back .
i kill him , i can leave this place ,
and i can start over again .
i have my own way i like them to die .
vampires can &apos;t get into mystic falls .
they can lurk around the borders .
sarah , the girl you attacked and you compelled ...
no !
she knows what i am .
my mom lived in mystic falls for years
before she had me .
where the hell are we ?
1994 .
my own hell . we &apos;re never getting out .
there &apos;s someone else here .
incendia .
we &apos;re on the same team .
do you always try and kill your teammates ?
the important thing is that you have your magic back .
because your magic is the key to getting the hell out of here .
and of course , i broke into the oval office
and took a picture of myself at the window looking all j.f.k. ,
but then i was like , &quot; wait . how am i gonna get
these photos developed ? &quot;
oh , my god ! just answer the damn question .
how are we gonna get out of this twilight zone ?
i got a question for you first .
why do you think we &apos;re stuck on a repeating loop of may 10 , 1994,
doomed to relive a solar eclipse forever and ever and ever ?
how the hell should i know ?
well , i heard you tell bonnie this place was your own personal hell .
i &apos;m kind of curious why .
i found everything you asked for--
can opener , shower drain , grinding wheel , jam ,
pocket knife , volume &quot; o &quot; of the encyclopedia ,
a nail , and a black marker .
now what ?
can &apos;t show you with my hands taped .
bonnie .
thank you .
ok . fine .
how &apos;s this pile of crap gonna get us out of here ?
i &apos;ll explain as soon as you tell me what you did on
may 10 , 1994 ?
what difference does it make ?
put it this way . bonnie &apos;s magic is one part of the equation .
my as yet undisclosed knowledge is the other ,
which means you would be hitching a ride home for free .
i just want to know if you deserve to come along .
or i could just torture you until you say something useful .
if you torture me , i &apos;ll get mad ,
and then i won &apos;t want to help you .
what kind of person needs to have that explained to them ?
play nice .
stop trying to impress the new guy .
why don &apos;t you just tell him your story ?
maybe because i don &apos;t want to talk
about the worst thing i ever did , bonnie .
now i &apos;m listening .
ready for some bad news ?
i barely seen you in 50 years , stefan .
you could invite a brother in .
give me one good reason why .
check your answering machine .
i &apos;m trying to turn over a new leaf .
oh , i heard your message .
i also heard you sent lexi some flowers
17 years after you left her to burn to death on a rooftop .
that &apos;s a little late , but i see you &apos;re trying to make amends .
i just want to know why .
well , i can tell you this , stefan .
i &apos;m tired of tearing up new york city .
maybe it &apos;s the partying , maybe it &apos;s my conscience .
i believe that would require one .
and then i had this moment of clarity ,
and i said , &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be great if i just woke up in my own bed
and could have a fresh start ? &quot;
you must be damon .
damon , this is , uh , zach salvatore .
he owns the house now . he knows the family history ,
and i told him if you got out of line
i &apos;d take care of you myself .
why are you always expecting the worst out of me , stefan ?
oh , i don &apos;t .
otherwise , i wouldn &apos;t allow this .
come on in , damon .
thanks .
you ready to start over ?
hell , yeah .
hey . any sign of our runaway girl ?
nope . caroline and i combed the border
of mystic falls 3 times already .
no sign of sarah .
she &apos;s not any of the roads ,
which means she &apos;s probably in mystic falls .
this is bad , stefan .
her compulsion went away as soon as she crossed the border .
she knows that caroline and i are vampires .
listen . i got to go .
i &apos;ll , uh , talk to you later .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
um , i &apos;m going home .
savannah &apos;s not your home , stefan .
it &apos;s an escape , a hiding place .
this is your home .
no . this was my home , but i can no longer enter its borders .
therefore , i have a new home .
so you &apos;re just gonna throw in the towel
and go back to your fake new life ?
look . my fake new life ended
when enzo decided to kill my not @-@ so @-@ fake girlfriend ivy ,
so i am going to go home , pack up ,
and start over again .
by pretending like your life here never existed .
you &apos;d be surprised how easy it is to forget the past , elena .
i &apos;m not buying it .
you lost your brother .
there &apos;s no way that you &apos;re fine .
you do not have to worry about me .
it &apos;s not like i haven &apos;t done this before .
i have a system .
show me .
prove to me that your system works .
if i believe that you actually are happy ,
then i &apos;ll let you go ,
but if i don &apos;t buy it , which i probably won &apos;t ,
i will keep harassing you until you come home ,
and i &apos;m talking about , like , enzo @-@ sized harassment .
deal ?
sure .
and what about our runaway girl sarah ?
well , we can &apos;t step foot in mystic falls ,
so now it &apos;s up to matt and jeremy .
attaboy . get her all out .
is he seriously still wasted ?
yeah . little punk showed up on my doorstep last night
at 4 : 00 in the morning drunk .
i thought you two were looking for sarah together .
i did my part . she is definitely
not hiding in the salvatore liquor cabinet .
listen . what about your vampire @-@ hating neighborhood watch guy ?
if sarah goes to him for help , that &apos;s a problem .
i &apos;m on my way to tripp &apos;s office now .
i think i can get him to trust me and tell me what he knows .
be safe .
alaric .
who do we have here ?
this is jeremy-- jeremy gilbert .
he is a little ...
underage ?
yeah .
yeah . i can see that .
i was hoping you could give him one of those
rapid rehydration hangover cure type things .
oh , yeah . you mean , the ones we reserve
for professional athletes and starving children
in third @-@ world countries .
yeah . i think we &apos;ll start with a full workup--
physical , blood , toxicology .
yeah . why don &apos;t you throw in an std screening while you &apos;re at it ?
really ?
yeah .
down the hall to the right .
do i want to know ?
it &apos;s just another day in the life
of an occult studies professor .
well , if that entails supervising drunk morons ,
then you and i have a lot more in common than i thought .
i know , and i &apos;m sorry karen .
jay was a good kid .
i promise . you &apos;ll be the first one to know .
ok .
tripp , are you ok ?
no .
no . i just told jay &apos;s parents that i was the one who found their son
dead in the woods last night .
i heard .
do you know what happened ?
you tell me .
he went to the party with you .
i don &apos;t know .
he was drunk . i offered to give him a ride home ,
and he said he &apos;d walk .
i should have driven him home .
ok .
i &apos;m gonna give the sheriff my statement
and try to make sense of what happened to jay .
wait . maybe i should go with you .
i might have been the last person to see jay alive .
ok . donovan . let &apos;s take a ride .
i need to be entertained while i work .
hell story , please .
remind me not to kill him .
maybe telling him your story will take your mind off of it .
whose side are you on ?
the side where get to go home to the people we love .
fine .
in may 1994 , i was living here .
i &apos;d come home to walk the straight and narrow .
can i have a sip of that ?
i &apos;m starving .
sure .
it &apos;s good , right ?
oh , yeah . i can &apos;t remember if that squirrel was roadkill
or one i caught in the rat trap .
better hope it was roadkill , though ,
because the rat trap was full of rat droppings .
swish your tongue around .
does it feel like hair , or is it more of a grainy pellet ?
how &apos;s it going zach ?
what &apos;s up with all the grocery trips ?
one of the boarders is craving blueberry pancakes .
you know , maybe i should run the salvatore boarding house .
take over for zach ,
get in good with gail .
she &apos;s on vervain .
so is zach ,
which means hands off .
perfect . our savior &apos;s insane and narcoleptic .
no , no , no . i &apos;m awake .
let me guess-- you killed the pregnant woman .
shut up , kai . you weren &apos;t listening .
i was listening in my sleep .
you were hanging out with your distant nephew zach ,
who you called uncle zach
because that &apos;s not confusing .
plus pregnant lady gail ,
who had a big bull &apos;s @-@ eye on her chest .
got it .
tell me you didn &apos;t kill a pregnant woman .
oh , that &apos;s totally what happened .
why else would today be his personal hell ?
oh , here we go .
the only reason that you &apos;re alive right now
is because i thought you could get us out of here
and you could help us ,
but you don &apos;t have any answers .
you &apos;re just a man @-@ child with jam on your fingers !
ok .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using a mystical relic .
it &apos;s called an ascendant ,
and it looks like this , damon .
the last time we had it
was in the pacific northwest .
oregon .
we ?
it belonged to my family .
so here &apos;s a little blood to get you started .
now all we need is a locator spell
to pinpoint its whereabouts .
think you can find our ticket out here , bon bon ?
hell , yeah .
she &apos;s cute .
was cute .
i &apos;m sorry .
me , too , but what &apos;s done is done .
so after taxes and social security
and health insurance , i &apos;m left with $ 206.03
to spend for the week .
you want to get drunk ?
stefan , health insurance ?
yeah . the point is to start over ,
pretend to be as human as possible .
oh , ok . so no vampire privileges ,
no baggage , nothing from our old lives whatsoever , huh ?
what &apos;s this ?
you got me there .
see , damon isn &apos;t around to call it a granny mobile , so ...
yeah . your brother really did love to torture people with nicknames
and just plain torture people .
that &apos;s one way to put it .
so your system for moving on requires
both burning bridges and a dead @-@ end job .
we haven &apos;t even gotten to the fun part .
paying utilities ?
no . deciding who you want to be for the next 30 years .
do you want to be an astronaut ,
you want to be an olympic athlete ,
you want to skip med school , boom , you &apos;re a doctor .
go ahead . challenge me .
i &apos;ll show you how it &apos;s done .
all right . let &apos;s see what you got .
ok .
quite a boozer that kid . put him on a saline drip .
he &apos;s lucky i didn &apos;t pump his stomach .
yeah . you know , he &apos;s had a rough couple of months .
did you bring him in here to put a band @-@ aid on it
and make some more excuses ?
no . i actually came here for some advice
from a professional .
well , a kick in the ass might help .
jeremy , too .
look . if he &apos;s anything like his sister ,
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s nothing i don &apos;t treat every single night on campus
or didn &apos;t do myself when i was a student .
ok .
what about you ?
former party animal ?
oh , yeah , yeah . i used to get kicked out
of the library all the time , you know ,
because it was closing .
right . head in the wiccan bible ?
ok . one more piece of professional advice .
when a successful , sexy ,
only moderately insecure doctor is flirting with you ,
give her your undivided attention .
caroline &apos;s laying low at the dorm ,
no sign of sarah yet ,
which means she &apos;s either hiding out
or she &apos;s planning her nightly news exclusive to out me .
well , if she does out you ,
then you start your life over somewhere else
free of all the , uh , supernatural drama .
right .
so you ready to see the system in action ?
ready .
all right .
hand over your ring .
what ?
your ring . yeah .
ok .
elena williams ...
stefan cooper , what are you doing ?
we &apos;ve known each other for a very long time now ,
and you &apos;ve always been my best friend .
i have always loved you ,
and i want to spend the rest of my life with you .
will you ...
wait !
you &apos;re not just proposing to me because i &apos;m pregnant , are you ?
no . no .
i @-@ i am proposing to you because you are my rock , ok ?
you have stood by my side
through the multiple rehabs , the jail time ,
the bull fighting injury .
i mean , you have brought me back from the edge ,
and , sweetheart , this baby
is the best thing that ever happened to us .
will you marry me ?
yes !
aw . you &apos;re crazy .
see that ? new identities , new lives .
it &apos;s easy .
thank you all so much . thank you .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ,
sequitas sanguinem .
it doesn &apos;t feel right .
maybe i need a bigger map .
maybe you &apos;re just out of practice and you suck at magic now .
ignore him , bonnie .
pretend he &apos;s a white noise machine .
that &apos;s how i used to tune out my siblings .
i grew with a ton of little sisters and brothers
and all of them constantly yammering ,
but it , uh , taught me how to focus .
easy there , big brother .
she doesn &apos;t know you .
at least buy her a drink .
can i call you liz ?
sure ?
your daughter is so adorable .
yeah . caroline &apos;s high maintenance ,
but she &apos;s worth it .
i am so getting rid of that photo .
stefan , come take a picture of zach and me .
sure .
thanks , stefan .
and now back to my cravings .
hey . um , what happened to your wrist ?
i don &apos;t know .
so how does thing help us watch the eclipse ?
you put it in between you
and the thing that &apos;s too hot to look at .
ahh ! it works !
my husband would get a kick out of you .
we should invite you over to dinner sometime .
damon , what &apos;d you do to gail ?
is everything ok ?
looks like the jig is up .
hey . look at me .
go home . forget you ever met us .
how the hell did you feed on gail ?
she &apos;s on vervain .
in her coffee .
i swapped it out last week ,
same for zach .
these people are my friends .
zach is family . they trust me .
and they &apos;ll trust us both .
look . i &apos;m only feeding inside the house , right ?
snatch , eat , erase .
it &apos;s all completely functional , stefan .
i told you it &apos;s a new start .
... nas ex viras , sequitas sanguinem .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ,
sequitas sanguinem .
the blood &apos;s moving towards virginia .
that can &apos;t be right .
uh @-@ uh . the spell &apos;s working .
it &apos;s showing me mystic falls .
it feels so ...
close .
it &apos;s right ...
here .
very good .
that &apos;s the ascendant ?
the one and only .
thanks for the mind games , jackass .
it was just another little test
to make sure bonnie &apos;s magic
was precise enough for the spell .
i do believe you &apos;re ready .
pack your bags .
we &apos;re going home .
so here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get , damon .
why &apos;d you insinuate yourself back into my life
and then cheat and lie and break all the rules ?
well , i lied because i knew you &apos;d be mad .
believe it or not , i like being here , stefan .
you &apos;ll get your daylight ring back
when you decide to behave .
now answer my question .
why &apos;d you come back here ?
because i missed my brother .
i wanted to have a connection to my humanity , stefan ,
i wanted to feel something again ,
and when i decided to come back home ,
it all came rushing back just like i hoped it would .
oh , congrats . now what ?
come on , man . let &apos;s just hit the road , you and me .
i &apos;ll let you drive my car ,
i &apos;ll get you off this vegan diet ,
teach you how to feed again .
it &apos;ll be great , stef .
what do you say ?
come on ! trust me .
yeah . i can imagine a road trip with you .
yeah .
i can imagine you feeding on innocent people
and leaving a trail of bodies behind .
i can imagine you making me drink human blood
and laughing at me while i suffer .
way to be an optimist , stefan .
i &apos;m just looking at the facts , damon .
1912 , you convinced me to drink human blood again ,
which is why i became a ripper .
1942 , you almost pushed me off the rails again
because you were so damn needy .
1977 , you left my best friend to die
after i sent her to come help you ,
and now i &apos;m finally happy ,
i have a new life , i &apos;m doing well ,
and , uh , you just can &apos;t handle that , can you , damon ?
i &apos;m not trying to screw up your dumb new life .
you don &apos;t have to try , damon .
all you have to do is exist
because no matter what i do or where i go ,
you will be with me forever ,
trying to destroy every single thing that i built .
i don &apos;t know why i thought this time would be any different .
i wanted it to be different ,
but you just keep failing .
guess that &apos;s a no on the road trip , huh ?
that &apos;s a no on the road trip .
so according to caroline ,
sarah &apos;s still m.i.a. ,
and now enzo &apos;s missing .
probably out killing someone else &apos;s girlfriend .
uh , uh . pregnant , remember ?
dumbest lie i &apos;ve ever told .
can i just take that one back ?
no , but you &apos;ll have to reinvent yourself in 30 years .
if you don &apos;t , people will start asking
why you &apos;re not getting any older .
but when i first met you ,
you said you &apos;d been away from mystic falls for 15 years .
what made you come back ahead of schedule ?
you said it yourself .
i met you .
since 1864 , i have been a carpenter ,
an ambulance driver , a migrant worker ,
high @-@ school student .
so then why auto mechanic for 200 bucks a week ?
no reason .
yeah . it must be hard ,
all that change without a constant in your life .
we haven &apos;t talked about your brother .
a little weird to hear you refer to damon as just my brother .
what else would i call him ?
i don &apos;t even know anymore .
anymore ? what does that mean ?
you know what ? it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s not important .
things change , right ?
to change .
who cares what people think , right ?
to change .
you &apos;re wandering around like a crazy man , why ?
i &apos;m&apos;oking for the exact right spot .
we need to find where the power of the eclipse is focused .
you know , you could &apos;ve just shown us the ascendant to begin with .
yeah , but i wanted to feel your hand on my chest .
there &apos;s something not right about him .
you &apos;re just not used to guys hitting on you .
you know , i can &apos;t wait to get out of here
and talk to somebody else .
can we just have a few lasting seconds of peace
while this idiot uses that thing to get the stars to align ?
hey . what &apos;s up with the nature walk ?
i used the ascendant to figure out
where we need to be standing during the eclipse .
great . let &apos;s do some magic , get the hell out of here .
oregon .
what ?
i &apos;ve read this paper , like , a thousand times .
there &apos;s something in it about oregon .
what about it ?
you know , kai said he had all those brothers and sisters ?
&quot; family massacred in portland &quot; ?
the only one missing was the oldest boy ,
a 22 @-@ year @-@ old named malachai .
who names a kid malachai ?
it &apos;s like they expected me to be evil .
all these kids were murdered .
hello ? not everyone died .
i had a soft spot for one of my sisters .
otherwise , i would have cut her lungs out
and not just her spleen .
what ?
you can survive without a spleen .
something tells me you &apos;re not speaking hypothetically .
well , look , these two , i , uh ,
hung off a stairwell railing .
then i put a hunting knife in her abdomen ,
and him i drowned in the pool .
he kept fighting me .
i was like ,
&quot; i saved you for last , you ungrateful little ... &quot;
anyway , that was that .
you just killed your whole family ?
coven to be precise .
oh , you know , a family of witches .
you &apos;ve been making her jump through hoops , and you &apos;re a witch ?
sort of yeah . no powers obviously .
oh , and of course , gemini coven did not take it too well
when they heard what i did in portland .
that &apos;s why they banished me here .
this place is a prison .
they created it for you .
yep ! this isn &apos;t your hell , damon .
it &apos;s mine .
you call this a fair fight ?
you &apos;re basically an original vampire .
you &apos;ve killed an original before .
now get your head in the game ,
and maybe you &apos;ll keep it out of the bottle .
happy ?
i am trying to help you pull yourself together , jeremy .
now what is your problem ?
my problem
is that everyone thinks that i shouldn &apos;t have one .
i have the right to be messed up right now .
bonnie is dead .
she knew it was gonna happen ,
and she said good @-@ bye over the phone
just so you ...
keep going . so what ?
so i could come back to life , right ?
you , elena , stefan , tyler , enzo .
she saved everybody but herself .
listen , jeremy . you want to talk about resentment , huh ?
is that it ?
my wife ran away because she would rather be a vampire
than be married to me .
come to find out , it was damon who turned her ,
and then she died ,
and then jenna-- she died ,
and then i died ,
and then the guy who killed my wife died ,
and i actually kind of miss him ,
and now i can &apos;t even talk to a girl
without fantasizing about tearing into her neck ?
i mean , jeremy , i have resentment for years , years !
i get it , ok ,
but i find a way to keep going
because that &apos;s what we do .
we find a way to keep going !
ok ?
right .
so if we were to run into each other in some random town in 30 years ,
do we pretend like we &apos;re strangers ?
elena , i &apos;m avoiding mystic falls , not you .
we can talk , we can visit ,
and if you ever need a car repair ,
i will give you the parts at cost .
bye , stefan .
bye .
hey , man .
noticed you weren &apos;t celebrating my engagement .
how come ?
hard to be happy for the guy who put my brother in the hospital .
oh . right , right , right . ok .
hey . remind me . which guy was it--
broken nose or fractured arm ?
i was kind of drunk .
i &apos;m still waiting for the congrats on my engagement .
&quot; i &apos;m really happy for you . &quot;
yeah .
that all you got ?
come on , man . hit me . come on .
you frigging enjoying this ?
you sick freak !
go home , clean up ,
and forget this ever happened .
what the hell are you doing ?
we &apos;re not letting kai out of here , ok ?
he just said he &apos;s a serial killer .
i don &apos;t care . i want to get out of here .
how can you not care ?
maybe because of all the horrible things you &apos;ve done ?
maybe because killing a bunch of kids is not a big deal
to someone who &apos;s murdered a pregnant woman ?
am i wrong ?
did you leave the door open ?
no . why ?
this eclipse party blows .
i didn &apos;t see the sun at all when i made it across the yard .
you forget how much stronger we are when we drink human blood .
zach .
damon , please don &apos;t hurt her .
i want my ring back , stefan .
attaboy .
i &apos;m never gonna be rid of you , am i ?
no . no , you &apos;re not
because in 1912
i showed you who you were , stefan .
in 1942 , i gave you your freedom ,
and in 1977 , i almost killed your best friend
because it should have been you there to help me , stefan .
you owe me ,
and it &apos;ll take you an eternity
to pay me back .
no !
an eternity of misery , brother ,
just like i promised .
poor nephew uncle zach .
stefan compelled uncle zach to forget
about the girlfriend and the baby ,
but he couldn &apos;t cover up all those murders .
the founders &apos; council was restarted ,
and stefan took off , left mystic falls for about 15 years .
we both did ,
and then when i saw uncle zach again ,
i couldn &apos;t look at him without remembering
that i had ruined everything ,
so it was a nice relief when i got to kill him .
ok . can we go back now ?
oh , come on , bonnie .
you want to go home to your friends ,
i want to go back and give the rest
of the gemini coven an excruciating death . win @-@ win .
look . i know this guy &apos;s not a model citizen , ok , bonnie ,
but i got to get back ,
not just for elena but for my brother .
i &apos;m sorry , damon .
sorry doesn &apos;t work for me .
hey . we might be having a bit of a disagreement ,
but don &apos;t ever lay a hand on her .
kind of a nonissue now .
missed today &apos;s eclipse .
rain check for tomorrow .
no .
so you and the sheriff don &apos;t seem to get along .
oh . liz and my wife were high @-@ school rivals ,
some issue about who was captain of the field hockey team .
you &apos;re married ?
i was .
yeah . kris died in a car accident .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , that &apos;s why i left mystic falls .
too many memories .
so what &apos;d you tell the sheriff about jay ?
oh , just what i saw .
uh , tons of blood .
probably a mountain lion .
just another animal attack , huh ?
you sound doubtful .
this is gonna sound weird ,
but last night , jay told me that he was
tracking a vampire .
i mean , that &apos;s crazy , right ?
i &apos;m gonna show you something .
i thought you agreed to leave .
i forgot my jacket , stefan .
what happened with that guy ?
i told you i have a system .
letting somebody kick your ass so that you can feel ?
you are the last person who should be lecturing
me on coping mechanisms .
you &apos;re not alone in your grief , stefan .
i lost bonnie when you lost damon ,
but i fought through it .
yeah ? all by yourself ?
yes .
and it was hard .
i know that you &apos;re pushing me away because i never liked damon--
believe me , that &apos;s not what it is .
and i know that he &apos;s your brother . i get it ,
but why inflict so much pain on yourself
for such a hateful person ?
i mean , he doesn &apos;t deserve your grief .
i mean , there &apos;s got to be another way that you can move on .
i &apos;m sorry that i can &apos;t just forget him like you , elena .
no one &apos;s forgetting him .
you are .
you erased him .
what are you talking about ?
you had alaric compel you to forget
every good thing that damon ever did .
you made him a monster in your own mind
because you couldn &apos;t handle the grief of losing him .
i don &apos;t believe anything that you &apos;re saying .
why would i do that ?
because you were in love with him ,
and he was in love with you ,
and when damon died , a part of you died , too .
wow . oh , god . what ? no , no .
stefan , how could i possibly love damon ?
believe me , i asked myself that for a very long time ,
and then eventually , i saw it .
damon inspired you ,
he pushed you to own the darkest parts of yourself ,
and when you died , he was the only one
that could make you feel alive again ,
and you made him feel human .
you love damon for the same reasons that i love damon
because in spite of every single thing that he did
we couldn &apos;t live without him ,
and now you don &apos;t have to , but i do ,
so i &apos;m gonna do it my way .
you can do it yours .
what is this place ?
a secret .
a secret i only share with people i trust .
you remember the gas leak in town over the summer ?
well , i came back to make sure my grandmother was ok .
first time i &apos;ve been back in years .
when i crossed the town border ...
something changed .
memories came flooding back .
i realized that my wife
didn &apos;t die in a car accident .
she was murdered ,
drained of her blood right in front of me ,
and the killer made me believe
i was responsible .
i had to find out what kind of monster could do all that .
vampires--
they are real ,
and one murdered my wife ,
but this is the one
who murdered jay ,
and i &apos;m gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies ,
starting with the one who bit your friend sarah .
sarah ?
you try anything ,
and i call 911 and out your vampire sister to the world .
hey . just take it easy . what do you want ?
answers . i found this when i was tossing the house last night .
that &apos;s my mom ,
and the reason i know this is
because i &apos;ve had this since i was a baby .
my mom was a jane doe .
her body was still warm when they dumped it
at the hospital 6 months pregnant .
the nurses thought i was doa , too ,
but one doctor did an emergency c @-@ section ,
and i survived .
i lived 3 months in an incubator .
they didn &apos;t know who my dad was ,
and neither did i ,
but then i found this .
your dad is zach salvatore .
how could you obliterate an entire chapter of my life ?
look , elena . as much as i like to think that i am full of wisdom ,
i think it &apos;s time we stop pretending
that i actually know what &apos;s best , ok ?
look . i &apos;ve got my own issues to sort out right now ,
and i think this will explain it much better than i can .
&quot; dear me , if you &apos;re reading this ,
&quot; then somebody spilled the beans
&quot; about your selective memory loss .
&quot; my money &apos;s on caroline .
&quot; yes , you loved damon .
&quot; you loved him with a passion that consumed you ,
&quot; and then when damon died ,
&quot; the void he filled was too deep , too dark .
&quot; facing an eternity without your soul mate ,
&quot; you went off the deep end .
&quot; you turned into someone that you weren &apos;t ,
&quot; a monster .
&quot; alaric can restore your lost memories .
&quot; all you have to do is ask ,
&quot; but i hope that you don &apos;t .
&quot; i tried it the other way .
&quot; i didn &apos;t see an end to the pain .
&quot; i want you to rediscover yourself
&quot; in the absence of the one who defined you .
&quot; if you feel any hope for the future at all ,
&quot; then you &apos;re already better off .
&quot; you &apos;ve been given a chance to start over .
&quot; i want you to take it .
i want you to be happy . &quot;
so what do you want me to do ?
can you hold on to that ,
keep it safe in case i ever need to read it again ?
shame eating ?
thinking about that pregnant lady .
she had a thing for pancakes .
that &apos;s what you remember ?
you remember it , don &apos;t you ?
you make pancakes every day .
because i &apos;m bored .
no . because you &apos;re punishing yourself .
you called this place your hell .
that means you feel remorse .
that &apos;s what makes you different than kai .
it means there &apos;s hope for you .
look . we can still get out of here , bonnie .
we can just steal that ascendant contraption ,
find out what kai knows . we &apos;ll ditch him .
he doesn &apos;t have any powers anyway .
actually , it &apos;s not that simple .
you got to stop doing that . it &apos;s creepy .
here &apos;s the thing . i have a peculiar effect on magic .
i can &apos;t generate it myself ,
but i can consume it from others temporarily .
family called me an abomination .
that hurt my feelings .
ok . we get it . ugh .
you can see why my coven and i didn &apos;t get along .
i smell an ultimatum .
if i consume all of bonnie &apos;s magic ,
i am just gonna end up killing her ,
but if we work together ,
we can all go home as friends ,
or i can devour her magic ,
kill you both and go home alone .
what &apos;s it gonna be ?
hello ?
ivy .
stefan , i don &apos;t feel so good .
your friend enzo made me drink his blood ,
and now i &apos;m just so thirsty .
