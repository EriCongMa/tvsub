hello . officer lori weston here to see the governor .
thank you , officer weston .
the governor will be with you shortly .
thanks .
i have , uh , clearly been here for a while .
you want the sports section ? i already read it .
yeah . sure .
thank you .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett , by the way .
hi . lori weston .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
commander mcgarrett .
officer weston .
the governor will see you now .
together ?
yes . follow me .
come in . come in . have a seat .
all right .
commander , have you met
officer weston from homeland security ?
yes , we , uh ... we just met .
yes , sir .
sir , does this have anything to do
with victor hesse &apos;s murder ?
no . i called you here for a different reason .
have a seat .
commander , i thought you and i had an understanding .
when i told you there was going to be accountability ,
i wasn &apos;t saying it just to hear myself speak .
um , i &apos;m ... i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you mean , sir .
you let a dangerous felon go last week in hopes
that he would lead you to wo fat .
you thought you could slip that one by me , didn &apos;t you ?
with all due respect , sir , the objective
is to catch wo fat , not the little fish under him .
with all due respect , commander ,
you broke my trust .
and there &apos;s going to be
consequences for that , as i said there would be .
what kind of consequences ?
officer weston .
sir .
i &apos;m sure you thought ,
coming here , you were going to be appointed
my new public safety liaison ,
but actually , i have a different position in mind for you .
wait a minute .
sir , if this has something to do ...
that &apos;s right .
officer weston , welcome to five @-@ o.
sir , we &apos;re not really recruiting new people right now .
no offense .
none taken .
commander , you &apos;re going to find officer weston to be
an incredible asset to you and your team .
she spent six years
with homeland security as a profiler .
sir , i actually really do appreciate ...
if this is about
you thinking of me ...
replacing officer kalakaua ...
for this position ...
wait . wait , wait , wait .
i &apos;m not looking to be a babysitter .
time @-@ out ! time @-@ out !
babysitter ?
time @-@ out .
this is not about officer kalakaua ,
and i &apos;m not asking you to babysit .
i &apos;m asking you to be a part of a team
that is vital to this state &apos;s safety .
and frankly , i am not asking ; i &apos;m telling .
i need to take this .
then you should take it .
excuse me .
mcgarrett .
yeah , go ahead .
yeah . i &apos;ll be right there .
okay , there &apos;s been a kidnapping , so , uh , i have to go .
then get on it .
sir , i really don &apos;t ...
what are you still doing here ?
you &apos;ve got a case .
go .
yes , sir .
i know neither of us expected this ,
but let &apos;s just try and make the best of it .
you ever work a kidnapping case before ?
i started my career with the fbi .
that &apos;s not what i asked .
i was in profiling .
you &apos;re avoiding the question .
five cases .
and how many of those cases ended successfully ?
three .
i &apos;ll drive .
i &apos;ll follow you .
wow . look at you .
you clean up nice , babe .
you got all dressed up for the new governor ?
win you any points ?
not exactly .
danny williams , this is officer lori weston ...
our new partner .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet ... our new what ?
partner .
governor denning assigned me
to your five @-@ o task force .
to do what ?
uh , assist you in any way i can .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m pretty sure the word you used earlier was &quot; babysit . &quot;
you &apos;re going to babysit us .
oh , okay , i &apos;m @-@ i ... i apol ... i ...
i apologize . he , uh ... he lost his manners
somewhere between the womb and kindergarten .
you will fit right in . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
come on , gq . duke &apos;s over here .
vic &apos;s name is jen hassley ,
15 years old .
abductor drove off in a red sedan .
her mother got a partial plate .
we got a maile alert out ?
just hit the wire a few minutes ago .
run that .
teenage girls are usually kidnapped for one of two reasons :
ransom or a sex crime .
where are the parents ?
over there .
any strange phone calls ?
anything at all out of the ordinary last couple weeks ?
no .
in over half of all kidnapping cases ,
the abductor is usually a relative or an acquaintance
of the victim .
is there anybody you can think of
that would have reason to want to take jen ?
no .
all right . i &apos;m going to send some of our people
to your house-- they &apos;re going to set up
phone taps in preparation for a ransom call .
okay ?
officer weston is going to accompany you home .
she &apos;s going to supervise the whole thing , all right ?
got something .
oh , my god .
i found this outside the changing tent .
does it belong to jen ?
jen was born with a heart condition .
she has to take this medication twice a day .
if she doesn &apos;t get this within 24 hours ,
she could ...
she could die .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
hey .
good . you &apos;re here .
what do you got ?
hpd reports all registered sex offenders within five miles
of the abduction site have been accounted for .
they &apos;re expanding the search now .
okay .
uh , what about jen &apos;s personal life ? anything ?
i scanned jen &apos;s cell records and social network profile .
everything &apos;s clean-- no suspicious messages ,
no strange calls , nothing to indicate
a potential threat .
all right , see , this is strange .
all right , she &apos;s got nothing personal
on her home page , right ?
it &apos;s all generic publicity stuff .
i mean , kids use these sites to vent ,
all right , share secrets , talk trash to each other .
it &apos;s like jen doesn &apos;t want anyone
to know who she really is .
okay , well ,
maybe she had a secret profile somewhere .
keep looking .
get jen &apos;s laptop , okay ?
mine it and see if you can find anything that she was trying
to keep away from her parents .
got it .
hey , just got off the phone with hpd .
maile alert lines are ringing off the hook .
i &apos;m going to have to head back to the station to coordinate a grid search .
keep us posted , all right ?
yeah .
hey . so what do we know about the new hire ?
she &apos;s cute .
she &apos;s very cute .
she &apos;s attractive .
she used to work for homeland security .
that could come in handy .
yeah , if she lasts .
what ? why wouldn &apos;t she last ?
we , let &apos;s see what she looks like
when she gets done with sergeant slaughter &apos;s boot camp .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
let &apos;s just try
and not get the new girl blown up , kidnapped , shot
on her first day , that &apos;s all .
can we do that , steven ?
i can &apos;t guarantee that .
hands on your head .
turn around slowly .
do you hear me ?
i &apos;m not gonna ask again .
you seem to have a lot of people who really , uh ,
cared about you .
that &apos;s nice .
who the hell are you ?
you might want to sit down .
danny was right .
jen was hiding something .
she has a second social network profile .
i managed to extract
all of the deleted e @-@ mails and private chats
and i found a bunch of exchanges with a guy named brant cunningham .
what do we know about him ?
not much .
but everything about it screams predator .
the account is brand @-@ new ,
the only e @-@ mails he sent were to jen , and that profile picture
is a stock shot of a male model
i identified through facial recognition .
all right , when was the last time they exchanged e @-@ mails ?
last week . he asked for her address .
said he wanted to send her something .
guys , i &apos;m not seeing anything from a brant cunningham here .
and the parents don &apos;t remember jen getting
anything from that name , either .
okay , it &apos;s got to be there .
well , it &apos;s not in her fan mail ,
which means she &apos;s hiding it .
wait , this is a girl who &apos;s deleting her private e @-@ mails
from this guy , right ?
yeah . most likely she didn &apos;t want her parents to find it .
huh . which rules out the sock drawer and under the mattress .
check for loose floorboards .
no .
the room &apos;s carpeted .
this is a good kid .
according to her mom , she &apos;s perfect .
she does what she &apos;s told , keeps her room clean .
i mean , she &apos;s about to go on a 32 @-@ mile race
and still remembers to make her bed in the morning .
clearly , appearances are important to her .
along with her accomplishments .
i found something .
what do you got ?
guys , the hassleys aren &apos;t jen &apos;s parents .
&quot; this is your birth mother ,
and she would like to meet you . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more , meet me behind the changing tent
after your race on saturday . &quot;
jen has always known she was adopted .
we &apos;ve been very open with her about it .
jen &apos;s real mother died in childbirth .
it was in the adoption records .
jen knows that .
i just can &apos;t believe
she arranged to meet this person
and didn &apos;t say anything about it .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;d lie to us .
yeah , well , my guess is
jen &apos;s abductor found out she was adopted ,
fabricated information about her birth mother
and used that into luring her to meet up him .
okay , so it had to be someone who knew she was adopted .
well , she talked about it
in her interview for aloha life magazine .
i mean , thousands of people could know .
i &apos;m gonna go take this letter to the crime lab ,
see if i can get a print off of it .
all right , hold on , hold on .
let kaye take the letter .
lori , i need you to
stay with the family , okay ?
okay .
and , lori ...
yeah ?
nice work .
thanks .
and nice work to you , too . that &apos;s good .
what ?
&quot; i want you to stay with the family . &quot;
i mean , you &apos;re keeping this woman at arm &apos;s distance .
is it because she &apos;s the governor &apos;s hire
or is it something else ? just curious .
hey , maile alert paid off .
found our abductor &apos;s car .
kam highway , southern edge of wheeler .
all right , let &apos;s go .
nobody .
it &apos;s empty . check the trunk .
i got blood .
and jen &apos;s jacket .
what do you got , max ?
the amount of blood i found on the jacket and in the trunk
is quite troubling .
approximately six to seven pints .
the odds of anyone surviving after that
much blood loss is quite low .
okay , but you &apos;re saying ,
i mean , it &apos;s possible she could still be alive , right ?
how old is the girl you &apos;re looking for ?
she &apos;s , uh , 15 . about 90 pounds . about .
if this is her blood , i find it highly doubtful
that she could have survived .
listen to me , max .
i need you to run this , okay ?
because i can &apos;t talk to the parents
until i know what we have , you understand ?
i &apos;m on it .
suspect &apos;s vin number :
17q4378019539572 .
got it .
running it now .
here we go .
your car is registered to a matt porter .
4810 loho street in kailua .
matthew porter ! five @-@ o !
clear .
all clear here .
no porter , no jen .
but you guys should see this .
that &apos;s jen right there .
who are these other women ?
victims .
or potential victims .
take a look at these .
sam baker , todd kilgore , charles tetchy .
he &apos;s got , like , 30 of these .
this guy &apos;s been at it awhile .
yep . and he knows how to disappear .
message two .
hi , julie , it &apos;s beth .
yeah .
i &apos;ve got a ticket to the show ...
that &apos;s great . okay , thank you .
that was the tsa ; they have an alert out
on all the names that porter &apos;s been using .
all right , we check plane tickets ?
yes , we did .
there &apos;s nothing been purchased under these names .
okay , good . so porter might still be on the island .
right . unless he got off using an alias we don &apos;t know about .
we &apos;re running out of time
to get jen her medication .
come on !
what do we got ? something , something .
i &apos;m working as fast as i can .
you putting pressure on an already stressful situation
is not gonna make me work any faster .
i can &apos;t even verify that matt porter
is his real name .
okay , whoa , whoa .
look , i don &apos;t know what his real name is , either ,
but i do know that one of his aliases , todd kilgore , is wanted
for questioning in a 2009 kidnapping case in nebraska .
okay , good , good , good .
so jen isn &apos;t his first victim .
or his last .
what do you got ?
julie nells .
i managed to get into her voice mail and found a message that
porter left for her yesterday . he asked her to meet him .
tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 a.m. , wailana coffee house .
all right .
hey , you &apos;re supposed to be at the hassleys &apos; .
what &apos;s up ? you all right ?
yeah , yeah . you got a second ?
yeah , sure .
good work .
how are the hassleys doing ?
they &apos;re a mess .
i mean , they &apos;re waiting on a ransom call
that you and i both know isn &apos;t coming .
what are you talking about ?
look , i get that you don &apos;t want me here .
it &apos;s your team , i wasn &apos;t your choice .
but sidelining me is just a waste of your resources .
okay , first of all , i put my resources where i need them .
i needed somebody on the phone .
come on .
i looked into the hassleys &apos; financials .
they don &apos;t make any money .
jen hasn &apos;t signed any endorsement deals .
her kidnapping was never about ransom , and you know that .
you just wanted me out of your hair .
fine .
fine ?
yeah .
fine .
i sidelined you .
well , at least you &apos;re man enough to admit it .
lori , we met this morning .
you expect me to trust you the way i trust these people out here ?
i &apos;ve been in the field with these people ,
they &apos;ve had my back , i trust them with my life .
the hassleys are trusting me with jen &apos;s life ,
and i promised them i &apos;d bring
their daughter home .
okay , well , there &apos;s your first mistake
right there .
excuse me ?
we don &apos;t make promises like that around here .
oh , really ? well , i do .
those two kidnapping cases that went south--
did you make the same promise to those families ?
yeah . i did . and i don &apos;t regret it .
sometimes you make all the right moves and it just isn &apos;t enough .
you know , the hassleys are no different .
i intend to keep my promise to them .
hey , wait .
tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 a.m. , wailana coffee house .
meet me there , okay ?
wait a minute .
so you &apos;re saying he was in your house ?
yeah .
this is captain fryer , the head of internal affairs ?
what did he want ?
he , uh , he asked me a lot of questions
about the asset forfeiture locker
and the money that they said i stole .
i don &apos;t understand . you answered all those questions already .
yeah , well , he wanted to see my face .
see if i was a good liar .
there &apos;s something else , isn &apos;t there ?
ia &apos;s ruling on my case tomorrow .
here , come here .
it &apos;s gonna be fine , okay ?
they got nothing .
porter &apos;s late .
yeah . he &apos;ll show .
thank you .
don &apos;t you just hate that ?
hate what ?
the top off .
you know , you get just the right mix going--
coffee , cream , sugar-- all working in perfect harmony .
then , when you &apos;re not looking , waitress comes , tops you off .
ruins a perfectly good cup of coffee .
that &apos;s why i switche to tea ; they don &apos;t mess with that .
what ?
i &apos;m just saying .
told you .
when you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
you know , i expected
somebody who graduated top of his bud / s class
would take his coffee black , but mm @-@ mm .
did you pull my file ?
mm @-@ hmm . last night .
which is when i assume you pulled mine .
you graduated with honors from penn state ,
but you switched from bio to criminal justice
in your sophomore year .
mm @-@ hmm .
what happened , you couldn &apos;t hack the sciences ?
uh @-@ huh , something like that .
yeah , phys ed was more my style .
phys ed ?
you care to elaborate on that ?
maybe when i know you better .
okay .
okay .
hey , any sign of porter out there ?
no .
how &apos;s the date going , buddy ?
chin ?
you didn &apos;t answer danny &apos;s question .
i will take that as no sign of porter .
i think she &apos;s done waiting .
let me see if i can stall her .
hey , you &apos;re julie nells , right ?
i &apos;m lo ... julie , wait !
she &apos;s running , she &apos;s running .
move , move .
julie !
whoa , whoa , come here , come here .
get away from me , i &apos;m not going back !
julie , it &apos;s okay , we &apos;re not here to hurt you .
where &apos;s matt ?
what did you do to matt ?
listen to me , hey , hey , we &apos;re five @-@ o.
look , okay ,
we just want to talk to you .
what do you want from me ?
we &apos;re just looking for matt porter .
why ?
because we think he might be trying to hurt you , that &apos;s all .
matt ?
he wouldn &apos;t hurt me .
he saved my life .
matt porter rescued me from a cult in northern california .
what do you mean &quot; rescued &quot; ?
that &apos;s what he does .
he &apos;s an extractor .
two years ago
i joined this religious movement near mount shasta .
when things changed , i tried to leave , but they wouldn &apos;t let me
and they &apos;ve been after me ever since ,
so i called matt .
he was supposed to meet me this morning
to help me disappear for good .
so why did you run from us ?
matt said they might send some people after me .
i &apos;m scared .
i won &apos;t go back there .
okay , okay .
when was the last time you spoke to matt ?
two days ago .
okay , how did you contact him ?
matt &apos;s got a private number
he only gives out to people he &apos;s helping .
okay , we &apos;re going to need that number , okay ?
thanks .
excuse us .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i mean , jen wasn &apos;t in a cult .
she didn &apos;t need to be saved .
why would porter kidnap her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just got
off the phone with max and he ran tests
on the blood we found in the trunk of porter &apos;s car .
it &apos;s not jen &apos;s .
oh , that &apos;s great news .
okay , so she could be alive .
well , that &apos;s the good news .
the bad news is that the blood
we found in the trunk was a match
to a john doe gunshot victim hpd found this morning .
max ran some dna and got that hit .
that &apos;s matt porter .
so where &apos;s jen hassley ?
according to max , matt porter was killed
and placed in the trunk of his car somewhere
between 8 : 00 p.m. and 11 : 00 p.m. on saturday
and more than likely
dumped along the kamehameha highway shortly thereafter .
okay , well , porter &apos;s not our guy .
jen was abducted on a sunday morning .
guys , i just got a strange hit on an alias
that porter was using .
which one ?
james westerfield ... it says here
in jen &apos;s adoption records that he was the one
who delivered jen to the hassleys 15 years ago .
okay , wait a minute .
if porter was an extractor back then ,
maybe jen &apos;s biological parents were actually in a cult .
what if her parents found out where she was
and they just wanted her back ?
this could be how they found her .
she &apos;s been in the press a lot lately .
maybe somebody put two and two together .
all right , we need to find out
which cult porter extracted her from
because that &apos;s where jen is right now .
we &apos;re ready for you .
i think i found something that may help narrow down
where jen was extracted from .
okay . she was born with a heart valve condition
that required emergency surgery .
those symptoms would have presented hours after she was born .
now , a lot of cults don &apos;t allow their members to see doctors
or take modern medicine .
so if jen was born into a cult ,
her only chance of survival
would actually be getting extracted .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking ,
so i ... i ran a search on the list of known cults
that prohibit medical treatment .
that is the preliminary list .
i &apos;m cross @-@ referencing it right now with porter &apos;s files
to see if we can narrow it down even further .
that &apos;s excellent work , that &apos;s great .
um , anything else ?
that &apos;s all i got , boss .
hey , hold up a sec .
is there , is there anything else you want to ,
you want to talk to me about ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , you seem distracted .
i want you to know that if something is going on ,
you can come to me .
i didn &apos;t want to bother you in the middle of a case ,
but ...
i received a phone call yesterday from langley .
my old boss at the cia said he picked up on some chatter
he thought i should know about .
what are you talking about ?
my fiance might be alive .
how accurate is this intel ?
they can &apos;t say , but i can &apos;t stop thinking about it .
okay , uh , when are you leaving ?
i was hoping as soon as we found jen .
if there &apos;s any chance he might be alive ,
steve , i need to be there .
yes , you do , and if there &apos;s anything that we can do ,
you , uh , you come to us , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna want to hear this .
matt , it &apos;s rhea .
i know you said it wasn &apos;t safe to contact you ,
but i need your help .
i think my father knows what happened .
jen &apos;s in danger .
i need you to make sure he doesn &apos;t get to her .
so i ran that private number the girl from the diner gave us .
turns out it has a voice mail account .
this was the only thing on it .
do we know who rhea is ?
she could be the birth mother .
i &apos;m running the name
and cross @-@ referencing with everyone in jen &apos;s life .
do we know where the call originated ?
came from an unlisted number on lanai
a couple of days ago .
wait , uh , there &apos;s a commune on lanai that &apos;s been red @-@ flagged
by several government agencies .
they &apos;re the only ones on that island .
that &apos;s got to be where jen is .
about 20 years ago they bought an old plantation
at the end of the kaena trail .
who runs it ?
haole by the name of steven carver .
this steven carver ?
yep , that &apos;s our island &apos;s jim jones .
nice .
how many people drinking his punch ?
carver started with about two families .
now he &apos;s got about 50 people on that property ,
mostly militia types , isolationists living off the grid ,
thinking modern @-@ day society and all its trappings
is the work of the devil .
this island is not only their home ,
it &apos;s their garden of eden .
they &apos;ll do anything to protect it .
i assume they &apos;re armed .
i wouldn &apos;t bet against it ,
but i know someone who &apos;s been on the other side of those walls
who might be able to give you a better picture .
yeah , i &apos;ve been in there .
it &apos;s barely living .
carver &apos;s got them thinking it &apos;s paradise .
do you know if one of his followers is a woman named rhea ?
yeah , she &apos;s carver &apos;s daughter .
okay , please , if you can , when was the last time you saw her ?
oh , a couple days ago .
she came in to use the phone .
okay , uh , is this her ?
yeah , it &apos;s an old one , but that &apos;s rhea .
okay , so carver &apos;s been the one exchanging the e @-@ mails with jen .
he wasn &apos;t lying ; this is her birth mother .
that makes carver jen &apos;s grandfather .
does carver have weapons up there ?
he has rifles , uses &apos; em to hunt .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need you to draw me a map of that compound .
sure , absolutely .
uh , can i help you ?
he one of them ?
yeah .
danny .
okay , he made us .
wait , whoa .
listen , he &apos;s gonna go back to the compound ,
tell carver we &apos;re here , carver &apos;s going to run .
what &apos;s the fastest way up there ?
there &apos;s only one road in .
unless ...
unless what ?
this is the only way in-- on an animal ?
we couldn &apos;t have got an atv
or a golf cart or something like ... ?
did you say atv ?
i did .
they wouldn &apos;t hear an atv from a mile away , would they , danny ?
but you know what ? your whining is probably louder than an atv .
whining ?
yeah , you &apos;re whining .
how long have you two been married ?
that &apos;s it , that &apos;s it right there .
what are you doing ?
i told you to keep away from here .
she &apos;s , she &apos;s not well .
that &apos;s none of your business .
it is my business-- she &apos;s my daughter .
and she &apos;s my granddaughter and you told me she was dead .
you threw her away like trash .
go on , go to your room .
i &apos;ll deal with you later .
here . uh , drink this . there &apos;s herbs in here .
it &apos;s good for your heart .
i don &apos;t want your tea .
i just want to go home . please .
this is your home .
i know this is hard for you to understand ,
but this is my fault .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t raise your mother right .

those people ...
are the ones that have been poisoning you .
now , i can make you better .
you have to trust me .
just drink your tea .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
all right .
according to this , carver &apos;s cabin
is right in the middle of the compound , okay ?
if jen is here , that &apos;s where he &apos;s gonna be holding her .
wait , i think that &apos;s her .
come on , we got to move .
down on your knees . now .
face down , face down . hands behind your back .
it &apos;s okay . jen , we &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
we &apos;re the police . we &apos;re five @-@ o.
get them inside . come on .
it &apos;s okay .
where &apos;s jen ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t know ?
my father found out you were coming , and he took her .
we got company .
down ! get down .
please .
can we try not to kill everybody in the compound , okay ?
one of these hippies might know where jen is , all right ?
fine .
one , two , three !
what did i just say ? hah !
go , go , go , go !
stay down .
lori . down !
drop it .
where &apos;s jen ?
where did carver take her ?
don &apos;t make me ask you again .
he has a plane .
where ?
where is the plane ?
two miles west of here .
but you &apos;ll never catch him .
get out of the plane . show me your hands .
show me your hands right now !
get out of the plane .
i just ...
get out of the plane .
on your knees . on your knees .
leave her alone !
that &apos;s my granddaughter .
jen .
jen , you hear me ?
everything &apos;s gonna be okay , all right ?
we &apos;re gonna get you back to your parents .
okay ?
i knew as soon as jen was born
that something was wrong .
she needed medical treatment .
with real doctors .
but my father would never allow it .
he said , &quot; medicine makes us weak .
we have to empower our bodies to fight . &quot;
but her little body-- it just ...
it just didn &apos;t have anything to fight with .
i @-@ i knew we were losing her .
so that &apos;s why you gave her away ?
the only way to save her life
was to let her go .
so i faked her death .
but a few weeks ago ,
my father was in town and saw a magazine article
about this amazing girl with a heart condition ...
... and he just knew it was jen .
so you called porter .
i tried to warn him that my father was coming .
and he said he &apos;d take care of it . and ...
now he &apos;s dead because of me .
no .
you were looking after jen .
you did what any mother would do to protect their child .
she &apos;s not my child .
the hassleys raised her .
and i &apos;m just thankful for everything they &apos;ve done .
rhea , there &apos;s someone who &apos;d like to meet you .
oh , you &apos;re leaving ?
kid &apos;s got a plane to catch in an hour .
yeah , so i guess this is good @-@ bye .
for now .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , cuz , how &apos;d it go ?
sir , you can &apos;t go in there .
we need to talk .
we have nothing to talk about , lieutenant kelly .
you &apos;re about to kill the career of a good cop
just because you think she did something wrong .
i know ... she did something wrong .
apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the family tree .
this isn &apos;t about me .
you &apos;re right . it isn &apos;t .
the governor wants to make it very clear
that there &apos;s a zero @-@ tolerance policy
with regard to crime and corruption .
he &apos;s tasked me with cleaning up this department ,
which is exactly what i am going to do .
starting with your cousin .
after a lengthy investigation by the internal affairs department ,
officer kono kalakaua has been stripped of her badge
and is no longer a member of five @-@ o
or the honolulu police department .
her case has been handed over to the prosecuting attorney ,
who is officially moving forward with charges .
i &apos;ll take your questions now .
