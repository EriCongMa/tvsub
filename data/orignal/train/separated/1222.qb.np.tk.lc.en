we all saw where he was standing ,
by the coolers where they keep the blood .
our blood .
we still don &apos;t know why he was visiting ali in jail
or why he fought with mona .
my dad doesn &apos;t think that i &apos;m college material .
he thinks kate is .
who is kate ?
my stupid , perfect step @-@ sister .
kate .
you know , training a horse , it &apos;s an art .
taking all the fight out of it until it truly is broken .
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna feel when i &apos;m through with you .
welcome to the family .
the winner gets $ 20,000 scholarship .
we &apos;re gonna have to pay for my tuition somehow .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re married , talia .
cyrus ?
back away from them !
now !
霍里斯大学故意毁坏公物事件
you told me that you were hired to paint a mural for hollis .
i did not say &quot; hired . &quot; i was careful about that .
well , do you know what else you didn &apos;t say ?
vandalism .
although we did not find a body ,
the amount of blood in the house
would indicate that the victim &apos;s wounds are fatal .
mona vanderwaal was murdered .
&quot; thanks for donating to my get @-@ into @-@ jail fund .
谢谢你们为我的坐牢资金做贡献 a
a. &quot;
what ? you find something ?
yeah . my brother &apos;s got jock itch .
ew . wish i didn &apos;t know that .
what &apos;s with all this new gym equipment ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s obsessed .
it &apos;s nice .
how much did he pay for this ?
hanna ? we &apos;re not shopping here .
okay , it &apos;s just a question .
i mean , i want to know
why mike &apos;s all of a sudden training to become a ninja .
maybe because he &apos;s running errands
for a blonde spider in cellblock h.
okay , guys , just stop .
this feels wrong .
no , what &apos;s wrong is mike stealing our stem cells
and handing them over to ali &apos;s &quot; a &quot; -team .
hanna , we don &apos;t know
what was in that envelope he gave cyrus .
it could &apos;ve been cash .
right .
so maybe he &apos;s hiding our dna in here
until he gets further instructions .
has anybody checked that mini @-@ fridge yet ?
what about the gym bag ?
no , i got it .
if your brother did send that bloody &quot; a &quot; text ,
then we should be doing more than turning his room inside out .
we should be setting fire to--
guys .
did you find that in here ?
it was under a really disgusting gym sock .
wait .
he just bought this last friday .
who is it for ?
and when did your brother acquire taste ?
why does mike have that ?
maybe he ordered it for mona and it just got in .
maybe it &apos;s a mother &apos;s day gift .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s telling his mom
&quot; i &apos;m with you . &quot;
these aren &apos;t just beads . it &apos;s a message , in morse code .
i &apos;ve seen these advertised online .
the beads , they spell out words .
&quot; i &apos;m with you ? &quot; with who ?
that necklace is probably for alison .
that &apos;s who mike &apos;s with .
oh , please .
if my customers knew it was lard ,
they &apos;d shove me in the oven .
it &apos;s your mom .
i &apos;ll email it . okay .
bye .
didn &apos;t she want to talk to me ?
no .
she just called about that leftover cobbler
you brought home last week .
what ?
isn &apos;t it nice that we have something in common besides you ?
do you think she knows about ...
us ? not from me .
we are moving slowly , emily .
and i am perfectly fine with you
and me staying just between you and me .
and your husband .
that &apos;s right .
do you just wake up this beautiful ?
mike .
we &apos;re not actually open yet .
well , the door is open .
can i get some coffee to go ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna need two .
okay .
do you want to bring a pastry or something ?
no , they &apos;re both for me .
it was a long night .
oh , really ?
what were you up to ?
i &apos;ve already got one big sister .
not looking for another .
i know your mom loves the idea of shipping you off to hogwarts ,
but what about you ?
are you freaked out about living overseas ?
no .
why ? should i be ?
no , you &apos;ll be fine .
i , on the other hand ,
needed a horse pill just to get across the ocean .
my advice is , don &apos;t take it &apos; til the wheels are off the runway .
why ? what happened ?
faulty equipment .
we had to get off the plane .
i was fast asleep ,
i got wheeled around on a luggage cart
by a bank teller from parma , ohio .
you slept the whole time ?
i have no memory .
zip . i mean i &apos;m told i ate a fish taco in my sleep .
how &apos;s it going ?
good . you remember jonny ?
what are you doing here at hollis ?
my dad just asked me to pick up some class schedules for jenna .
what are you doing here ?
uh , jonny has an old friend
who has an oxford connection and he just--
it doesn &apos;t matter .
but how &apos;ve you been ?
is tanner still making you work 24 / 7 ?
pretty much .
well , if you &apos;re free tonight--
i &apos;m not . but i &apos;ll call you later .
sure . okay .
uh , it was to nice see you again .
same here .
what was that ?
it &apos;s an expression . in italian .
and completely pretentious .
the necklace said &quot; i am with you . &quot;
why are you so sure it &apos;s for ali ?
who else ?
mike has been to her jail cell more than once .
and he &apos;s meeting up with her sketchy friends ,
leaving candy grams in the woods .
and he just took out a huge withdrawal
from &quot; a &apos;s &quot; bank account last week .
so he &apos;s using alison &apos;s money to buy gifts for alison ?
classy .
do you want me to say something to aria &apos;s brother ?
no ! no , god , no .
why aren &apos;t you answering it ? is that aria ?
no .
i &apos;ll just call her later .
&quot; her &quot; ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m gonna go through with this .
this coach is pricey and if it &apos;s going to cost me money
just to be in this thing--
whoa , whoa , slow down .
speak english .
i enrolled in a beauty pageant .
miss teen , county @-@ wide .
the winner gets $ 20,000 prize .
i could use that towards my tuition .
okay , stop .
there has to be a better way to bankroll college
than parading around in a bikini
and being judged like a heifer at a 4 @-@ h fair .
caleb , this is not about big hair and twirling a baton .
i have to have this money so i can get out of this town .
okay , let me help you .
you know , we &apos;ll call my mom in santa barbara .
the guy that she &apos;s married to , he &apos;s loaded .
we &apos;ll ask them for a loan .
after my dad basically slammed the door in my face ?
no way . i am not asking anyone for anymore help .
fine .
but have you really thought this through ?
that pageant world is squeaky @-@ clean ,
and last week you were modeling a hazmat suit
and pushing around a barrel with a liquefied friend in it .
i already talked myself into this .
i don &apos;t need any other reason to back out .
i &apos;m going to do this . i have to .
listen , if that was awkward ,
you could &apos;ve just introduced me as the guy who lives in the barn .
i wasn &apos;t introducing you . toby knows you .
yeah , well , i think he &apos;d rather know me as the guy who lives in the barn .
okay , well , this has nothing to do with you , jonny .
i mean a lot of stuff &apos;s been going on and toby &apos;s just removed himself ,
not just from me ,
but from everybody .
jonny ?
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s wrong ?
isn &apos;t that ...
our vandalism ?
why did they call it &quot; the trial of the century &quot; ?
because clarence darrow was--
no , there &apos;s no clarence darrow .
that was scopes . different decade .
um , &quot; trial of the century , &quot; stanford white case .
first time a psychiatric defense was ever successful .
harry thaw shot stanford white because he ...
oh , um , because he was jealous
of his relationship with evelyn biscuit .
nesbit .
nesbit . yeah , that &apos;s what i said .
oh , thanks .
do you want to take a break ?
i know your head &apos;s not in this game right now .
and if you &apos;re worried about your brother ...
i &apos;m worried about a lot actually .
you know what ?
there is something that you can help me with .
so , my brother goes down to this gym on east elm .
could you follow him there ?
just go in and see if he &apos;s meeting someone ?
i mean i &apos;d go myself , but if he saw me there--
got it . i &apos;m on it .
were you in my room ?
what ?
you were in my room .
why the hell were you in my room ?
mike !
calm down .
i @-@ i was just doing laundry .
i don &apos;t keep underwear in my desk , aria .
i &apos;m gonna go outside and make a call .
you have no right to be going through my things .
what are you worried about me finding , mike ?
none of your damn business !
and , i swear , if you touch any of my things again ,
you will live to regret it !
compelling , aren &apos;t they ?
is this a joke ? this is my work .
your work ?
really ?
yeah . mine , too .
i helped-- i-- this was all one piece .
not when i received them .
received them ? from who ?
you can &apos;t just stick these in fancy frames
and then sell them without my permission .
i &apos;m sorry , who brought these here ?
somebody from hollis saved them from being
hauled off in a garbage truck .
so technically , they &apos;re mine .
until someone buys them .
i have a list of questions here from last year &apos;s pageant .
let &apos;s try a few .
how would you reverse the extinction
of today &apos;s endangered species ?
what is your opinion of our country &apos;s current foreign policy ?
hanna , these pageants aren &apos;t just about being pretty anymore .
pretty isn &apos;t the point .
judges don &apos;t give out crowns to living lollipops .
you need to have an opinion about the world we live in .
i do .
good .
let &apos;s talk about the talent portion .
have you given that any thought ?
what do you do well ?
lots of things .
as in ?
hanna , look , if you really want this ,
you &apos;ve got to feel it on a cellular level .
there are girls that have been training for this
since they could flush the toilet themselves .
i dance .
that &apos;s your talent ?
yeah , i dance .
晚点跟你解释 汉娜
excuse me ?
i &apos;m looking for talia .
is she in the kitchen ?
no . you just missed her .
she had to leave early for a catering gig in philly .
oh , right . i forgot .
i &apos;ll call the landlord .
can i tell her who stopped by ?
sorry . of course .
i &apos;m eric , talia &apos;s husband .
you must be emily .
of course .
right . um , talia talks about you all the time .
she does ?
yeah .
you must be something special
if you can get her to take a bike ride .
i can &apos;t get her to stop working long enough
to walk to the mailbox .
yeah , well , it was just an easy ride .
single lane . we hardly got of the bikes .
emily ?
i know what &apos;s going on with you and talia .
you don &apos;t have to feel weird .
sorry , i @-@ i @-@ i do .
i didn &apos;t know about you until--
it &apos;s okay . i understand .
really ? &apos; cause i &apos;m still--
look , talia and i have been together a long time .
and if she needs to experiment , have a one @-@ time thing ,
i can live with that , &apos; cause i love her .
and i expect to be doing that way longer than anyone else .
come on in . hanna &apos;s still in the shower .
can i get you some breakfast ?
no , i &apos;m okay , thanks .
i can &apos;t dance on a full stomach .
well , i didn &apos;t know you could dance at all .
hanna says you &apos;ve been taking lessons since you were four .
three , i stopped when i was in seventh grade .
my mother was hoping for a ballerina instead of a jock .
emily , do you think she knows what she &apos;s getting herself into ?
i &apos;m having disturbing flashbacks
to that campaign for homecoming queen .
that was different .
this pageant isn &apos;t about proving something to herself ,
it &apos;s only about winning tuition money .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean ...
it &apos;s okay . it is what it is .
i didn &apos;t expect to be in this position .
miss marin , can i ask you something ?
sure .
do you think it &apos;s okay to date a person
if some part of you knows it &apos;s not gonna last forever ?
i mean , if it &apos;s amazing in the moment ,
but ultimately , you think it &apos;s probably doomed ?
are you asking me about me or are you asking me about you ?
neither .
i &apos;m just curious .
emily , people get hurt
and disappointed in relationships every day .
but no one should jump into one with that intention .
so wait .
and he put it inside the tree ? what was it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i started to climb up , but then i heard something
and i thought he was coming back , so i took off .
i could go back .
no .
it &apos;s okay . you did the right thing .
your instincts were right .
he &apos;s definitely up to something .
it &apos;s in the woods behind mona &apos;s house .
i know which tree it is , i could show you .
if you could just describe it , i &apos;ve got it from here .
you shouldn &apos;t go alone . seriously .
i don &apos;t think you should be alone in the house with him either .
i won &apos;t be . my dad gets back later .
i &apos;m fine , really .
are you sure ?
&apos;cause you know i &apos;m here if you need me .
where &apos;s your toolbox ?
why ? did something break ?
no . i just need your toolbox .
really ? there &apos;s nothing in there
that &apos;s gonna help you pick a lock on a gallery door .
no , but i can take it off its hinges .
look , before you plan on stealing back your own work ,
why don &apos;t you let me talk to my mom ?
you must have legal recourse .
is she into representing vandals ?
besides , judges don &apos;t like me .
what do you mean ?
i mean , i &apos;ve been screwed over
by enough authority figures in my life
to know not to start trusting them now .
well , amen to that .
don &apos;t get that look in your eye .
you &apos;re not driving my getaway car .
if you &apos;re aiming for oxford , you need to be buttoned @-@ down ,
not badlands .
okay , look , i know that i said
i needed to be on the straight and narrow ,
but this is different .
you &apos;re being exploited .
if he even sells one of those paintings ...
he already has .
what ?
i checked online .
which one ?
corner rabbit .
i painted that !
where is your toolbox ?
that &apos;s where you applaud .
i &apos;m holding two cheese steaks .
i don &apos;t have enough hands .
well , seriously , what did you think ?
it was good .
&quot; good ? &quot;
good is not good enough .
hanna , relax .
we still have time to make it great .
yeah , 2 hours .
my coach is coming over here to check on my progress .
she &apos;s your coach .
she &apos;s coming by to support you .
have you met nan zabriskie ?
she makes you feel like the girl in fat camp
who got caught eating her toothpaste .
what ?
it was minty .
did you forget the mustard ?
no . it &apos;s on there .
caleb , what &apos;s going on ?
somebody else signed up to be in this pageant .
what do you mean ?
who ?
no freaking way .
what ? who is it ?
kate randall has this room reserved tomorrow at 7 p.m.
kate randall ?
as in your stepsister kate randall ?
no , this has to be someone else .
really ?
that goes to the same high school as her ?
you know , it wasn &apos;t enough that she stole my father
and my college money ,
now she wants to go after my crown , too .
hanna , wait . where are you going ?
you cannot just go and punch her out .
i am going to the bathroom to pee .
and when i get back ,
we are going to rehearse until it &apos;s perfect .
i am not gonna let her take this away from me .
can i help ?
i think this dead bolt may require
more than what i brought .
i got it .
how many times you gonna borrow when i &apos;m out there ?
you &apos;re new at this , aren &apos;t you ?
how is she doing ?
she &apos;s doing good .
i &apos;m not convinced .
is she having a hard time keeping up with emily ?
no , no , no , she &apos;s keeping up .
it &apos;s who she &apos;s competing against , that &apos;s the problem .
that &apos;s it .
come .
last one . come on , come on .
toby ?
what are you doing ?
is this your van ?
yep , that &apos;s my painting in the seat .
jonny !
i &apos;ve got the rest in the back .
he was just taking back what was his .
would you step back , please ?
what are you doing ? he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
if you want to question somebody
you should be questioning the creep who runs the gallery .
open this up for me .
toby-- no .
leave it alone , okay ? what are you even doing here ?
i &apos;m doing my job . responding to a call .
the question is , what are you doing here ?
she didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you can let her go .
that &apos;s not your call to make .
you need to come down to the station with me .
please turn around and put your hands behind your back .
toby , stop it !
spencer , it &apos;s okay . i got this .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
he &apos;s only doing this because he &apos;s mad at me .
no , i &apos;m doing this because a business was burglarized
and there are stolen goods in the vehicle .
wait . you cannot arrest him !
what are you doing ?
have you even heard a word that i &apos;ve been saying ?
will you please just stop being a cop for a minute ?
toby !
just walk away , spencer .
no , i won &apos;t . will you please just talk to me ?
i can &apos;t do this here .
okay , when do you want to talk about this ?
you &apos;re still on tanner &apos;s radar .
she wants to take advantage of my relationship with you .
this isn &apos;t about tanner .
it is .
don &apos;t give her ammunition . just walk away .
walk away !
that was revealing .
hanna ...
the girls who take this crown home
all have one thing in common .
they have allure .
mystery .
you , however , need to learn
to keep a secret in this age of over @-@ sharing .
i have lots of secrets .
well , anger isn &apos;t one of them .
look , i know that i messed up on that one move , but--
it &apos;s not about the one move .
it &apos;s ... the whole package ,
everything you &apos;re putting out there .
you &apos;re not pageant material .
it was , um-- it &apos;s my fault .
i pick the song .
it doesn &apos;t show what hanna can really do .
oh , i think i &apos;ve seen more than enough
of what hann can really do .
i &apos;m sorry , this isn &apos;t going to work for me .
you know , that was a really lousy thing for you to say .
i &apos;m doing her a favor , dear .
taking her money would be criminal .
she &apos;d only crash and burn in a much more humiliating
and public setting .
she doesn &apos;t have what it takes to go the distance .
you , however , do .
i only came here to help a friend .
that &apos;s very generous of you .
you know , hanna needs to win this .
she might need it , but she doesn &apos;t want it .
there &apos;s a big difference .
hanna !
hanna , wait !
emily ?
what are you doing here ?
h ... how did you know that i was--
your mom told me .
i got your message from earlier
and you sounded weird .
what happened at the brew yesterday ?
did ezra find out about us ?
no .
i met eric .
you told him i was an experiment ,
a one @-@ time thing .
i didn &apos;t know where this was going .
it &apos;s going nowhere .
i &apos;m not into girls because it &apos;s trendy .
i don &apos;t think of you that way .
this relationship now has three people in it , talia .
and you &apos;ve been lying to every one of them .
look , i need to go , okay ?
i have a friend who needs me right now .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
never mind what i &apos;m doing here .
why is this here ?
mike , why are you stashing my blood in the woods ?
it &apos;s not yours .
really ?
whose is it ? is it spencer &apos;s ?
is it hanna &apos;s ?
mona &apos;s .
now give it to me .
didn &apos;t you hear me calling you in front of the school ?
hanna , that woman is not a coach .
she &apos;s a gorgon .
i don &apos;t care how many beauty pageants she &apos;s won ,
she &apos;s an ugly person .
hey , girls . i didn &apos;t hear you come in .
hanna , i spoke to your father .
he doesn &apos;t know anything about the pageant
or how kate could have signed up for that room .
she &apos;s not even in pennsylvania this weekend .
what ?
doesn &apos;t matter anyway .
thinking i could do this was asinine .
says who ?
my coach .
who would rather be your coach .
i &apos;m gonna go take my shower .
did you stick around long enough
to hear what happened after she said that ?
i told her off , hanna .
she had no right--
who &apos;s that from ?
oh , my god .
did &quot; a &quot; put kate &apos;s name on the sign @-@ up sheet ?
&quot; a &quot; is sitting in jail , emily .
mike did this .
and alison &apos;s gonna use whoever she can
to keep us here forever .
and guess what ?
it worked .
i &apos;m not doing that pageant .
well , i am .
for you .
i know how much you need that money ,
and i swear , i will win that prize for you .
emily , stop .
&quot; a &quot; is just gonna come after you , too .
&quot; a &quot; can come after me any day of the week , anywhere .
that &apos;s not going to stop me from helping someone i love .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
did my mom come down to the station ?
she did .
and posted my bail .
okay . okay , you &apos;ll pay her back .
i already have .
she took it out of the security deposit for the lease
which expired about 20 minutes ago .
she &apos;s not kicking you out .
i believe the words she used were &quot; effective now . &quot;
is there room for interpretation ?
do you guys have any packing tape ?
it &apos;s that scumbag from the gallery
who should be punished , not you .
if toby had made just one call .
i don &apos;t think officer toby was in a calling mood .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i ...
i can &apos;t believe that he just acted like such a--
such a what ?
an over zealous cop ?
over zealous boyfriend ?
where are you gonna go ?
who knows ?
maybe i &apos;ll live in my car for a while .
i &apos;ve got some cool art to hang on the walls .
wait .
take this , too .
dad .
dad , are you here ?
dad !
stay away from me !
do you hear me ?
aria , listen to me .
no , i swear to god i &apos;ll call the police .
just listen , okay !
i can explain .
do you want to know what happened to mona or not ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i didn &apos;t hurt her .
a few nights before thanksgiving ,
i went to mona &apos;s house and i ...
i surprised her .
when did he get the axe ?
i can &apos;t keep up with you , lesli .
i swear we &apos;re gonna need the entire weekend
just to catch up .
oh , come on , lesli , just try .
please .
mona ?
lesli , i have to call you back .
what is all that ?
what is this ?
what the hell is going on ?
don &apos;t touch that , okay ?
just leave it alone and i &apos;ll explain .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve been offered a chance to make things right
for your sister and her friends .
mona , what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about exposing &quot; a &quot;
and finally bringing that person down .
is that your blood ?
yes .
and soon it &apos;s going to be smeared all over this house .
and alison dilaurentis is gonna look responsible
for killing me .
because &quot; a &quot; wants to see her locked up .
why would you want to be involved in all this ?
because &quot; a &quot; came up with this plan , mike ,
and it &apos;s brilliant .
wait , wait , wait .
stop .
you &apos;ve been talking to &quot; a &quot; ?
not directly .
but i will eventually .
i have to earn it .
and to do that , i have to commit to this 100 % .
that means i go away .
and when i find out who &quot; a &quot; is , i come back .
alison gets out of jail
and your sister and her friends are finally safe .
and i &apos;m everyone &apos;s hero .
what do you mean &quot; go away &quot; ?
for how long ?
you have to look at the big picture , mike .
it &apos;s only temporary .
mike ,
if what you &apos;re telling me is true--
it is .
i swear .
we fought about this for days and she convinced me
that she had it all under control ,
that she would be safe .
i don &apos;t believe that anymore .
is this why you &apos;ve been visiting alison in jail ?
you told her mona &apos;s plan ?
mona and i were supposed to meet a bunch of times .
but she &apos;s never shown up .
i only went there to find out
if she knew anything about &quot; a. &quot;
because you think that &quot; a &quot; double @-@ crossed mona and killed her .
but why are you so sure that alison isn &apos;t &quot; a &quot; ?
she can &apos;t be .
alison wasn &apos;t even here when it happened .
cyrus told me that &quot; a &quot; had him
get alison out of town that day .
mike , why do you have mona &apos;s blood ?
she gave it to me ...
as a promise that she would be coming back .
i wasn &apos;t hiding it in that tree because i hurt her .
i was hiding it because i didn &apos;t want you to find it
and ask questions .
that was all i had left of her .
so that necklace was for mona ?
mike was holding onto any grain of hope ,
but not anymore .
he realizes she &apos;s really dead .
i guess your brother didn &apos;t realize
how vicious &quot; a &quot; can be .
i can &apos;t believe your brother knows about &quot; a &quot; at all .
if mona told mike , she must &apos;ve really trusted him .
more than i did .
so what now ?
do we tell alison ?
how can we ?
we &apos;ve destroyed a lot of evidence
that could &apos;ve proved that she was innocent .
and basically made a barricade
so the police had to throw her behind bars .
well , are we gonna say anything before her trial ?
we have to .
we accused her of being &quot; a. &quot;
to her face .
