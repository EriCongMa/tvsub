troy and abed back from summer .
wait a minute . something &apos;s changed .
oh , there &apos;s 12 additional thumb tacks on that board .
they &apos;re driving me crazy .
no , i meant this . trying out the hipster look .
it &apos;s cool , but also not .
hey , guys , have a good summer ?
take them off .
happy first day of school .
good morning . i brought brownies .
congratulations , it &apos;s me .
huh , i see we &apos;ve all reinvented ourselves over the summer .
a little late to the hipster party much ?
a little much on the much much ?
we should get to class ? where &apos;s pierce ?
hey @-@ o !
sorry , i &apos;m late .
damn mexican cleaning woman did a cha @-@ cha on my glasses ,
so i got to wear this old pair .
abed . abed .
abed .
yup .
did you go to your happy place ?
yeah .
did you envision a babbling brook like i described ?
i started out with a babbling brook ,
but then i layered in elements from our world .
i &apos;m sure fans of the babbling brook will complain ,
but i thought that was limiting .
well , it &apos;s best to keep it simple .
it was a babbling brook .
okay .
here &apos;s the deal , jessica biel .
the first day of senior year is emotional for everyone ,
so i hereby therapize you to go to your happy place
whenever you feel stressed .
i found my lucky notebook .
found my lucky charm .
abed , you ready for our last first day of school ?
are you ready , buddy ?
i just need a minute .
* this is my show *
* it &apos;s about me *
* and all my friends on abed tv *
* my happy place , nothing but fun *
* nothing but laughs and smiles and then we rerun *
* for those times when life &apos;s too hard to face *
* i &apos;ll find some happy in my happy place *
abed &apos;s happy community college show is
filmed before a live audience inside of my head .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re finally getting into this class .
i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s a class called
&quot; the history of ice cream . &quot;
seniors !
there they are .
seniors !
oh , speaking of seniors ,
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m going to do senioritis this year .
you know , just hangin &apos; out and blowin &apos; off classes ,
pullin &apos; pranks , not sayin &apos; my &quot; g &quot; s .
ooh , i &apos;ll pull some pranks with you .
okay . or jeff or whoever . you know ,
whoever &apos;s around . whatever .
so , abed , after class , we &apos;re still doing our
first @-@ day @-@ of @-@ school tradition , right ?
you know it .
we like to make wishes in the fountain .
fellas , i hate to tell you , wishes aren &apos;t real .
if you want something bad , you have to work for it .
or use a spell .
all of our wishes come true .
last year , troy wished
we got bin laden and the dorito taco .
yeah , but obama got credit for both .
could you wish for jeff to be on time for once ?
no . no wasting wishes on impossibilities .
we have to make this year count ,
especially since it &apos;s the last one .
oh , no , is all this for &quot; the history of ice cream &quot; ?
they overbooked it , so it &apos;s first come , first serve now .
oh , just like real ice cream .
guys , over here !
oh , jeffery .
jeff , i can &apos;t believe that you came early .
don &apos;t you read gary &apos;s twitter feed ?
he posted a crisis alert about it .
i came early to save seats .
oh , you know what , girls ,
i gave you the old flyer .
&quot; instagram for besties &quot; is in room 44 .
showing up early , helping others , sending girls away ?
could this be a whole new jeff winger ?
don &apos;t ruin it by approving it .
oh , so that &apos;s progressed .
i mean , it &apos;s progressed ,
but it hasn &apos;t progressed @-@ progressed . it &apos;s progressive .
good luck , troy .
you can &apos;t just walk in here !
i &apos;ve been pissing in jars for an hour .
trying to keep this seat .
all right , all right .
all right . simmer dean .
this can &apos;t be good . he &apos;s dressed as himself .
greendale &apos;s registration system has been hacked .
that &apos;s right . someone hacked into the supply closet
and counterfeited these
&quot; history of ice cream &quot; admission cards .
whoever did this is very good .
there is only one fair way to solve this . so ...
follow me to ...
the hunger deans !
thank you . thank you .
there are 35 tests of strength and agility .
the winner of each one of these contests
will be awarded a red rubber ball .
no ball , no ice cream .
and these are impossible to counterfeit
because each one has been marked by my distinct bite print .
guys , we need to take this class .
it &apos;s the only history credit this semester .
whatevs . we &apos;ll take it next semes .
ter . semester .
but i need it now .
okay , i took some extra classes online ,
and i &apos;m one history credit away from graduating .
jeff , you &apos;re graduating early ?
well , graduating after 30 can &apos;t be characterized as early .
when were you gonna tell us , jeff ?
i was working on a speech .
and , believe me , it tied in a lot of things .
there was a lot of resolutions and epiphanies .
and it would have gone down a lot better
after we had taken the ice cream class together .
so that &apos;s why you were holding our seats ?
for your own selfish reasons ?
no , i want us to take the class together .
i just want it to be the last class we take together .
i probably should have phrased that differently .
fine . win your red ball .
what do i care ? i &apos;ve got a senior prank to pull .
shirley .
mm @-@ hmm .
so , abed , ready to make some wishes ?
make chocolate hot dogs a reality ?
actually , why don &apos;t you go with britta ?
i think i &apos;ll just hang out here and watch .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . f @-@ i @-@ n @-@ e or f @-@ y @-@ n @-@ e ?
we made one of &apos; em a code for &quot; not fine . &quot;
oh . f @-@ y @-@ n @-@ e .
okay , he &apos;s fine . let &apos;s go .
see you around , old jeff .
no .
no , new jeff . new jeff does not just look out for himself .
new jeff is gonna win seven red balls
because he is not gonna take that class
unless you guys are with me .
look , we &apos;re gonna have to leave this place sometime .
like an ice cream cone melting in the sun ,
our time here can &apos;t last forever .
that was part of the speech i was writing !
hey , guys . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , just making plans for the future .
can &apos;t stay at greendale forever .
hey , is mine different than yours ?
look out below .
coming in for a land @-@ dean .
amelia earhart ?
close . i am america &apos;s sexiest aviator ,
catch me if you can / 《 逍遥法外 》
leo dicaprio .
and , just as his character lost his mind ,
so have i lost your student records .
what ? i can &apos;t believe it .
yeah , amelia earhart would have been faster .
as you know , our student records are stored
on a microsoft paint file ,
which i was assured was future @-@ proof .
meanwhile , our extended warranty is not being honored by
the restaurant that used to be circuit city .
but i think the fairest way to handle this
is to have everyone repeat the last three years .
you can &apos;t be serious .
in @-@ dean , i am .
i &apos;m gonna be here forever .
forever . forever . forever .
i &apos;m gonna stay in here forever .
gentlemen , and ladies .
my first red ball
is way up high .
to touch my ball ,
first touch the sky .
go !
give it up , leonard .
i &apos;m gonna eat your ice cream , winger .
agh ! you ? you &apos;re pre @-@ med !
i want ice cream .
yeah , well , i want to graduate with dignity .
not cool !
jeff &apos;s really going after that ball .
there &apos;s got to be a joke in there somewhere .
that &apos;s my first ball .
new jeff !
give me a minute . give me a minute .
no .
you know , if we &apos;re doing the first three years over again ,
i could change majors .
i &apos;ve always been curious about forensics .
hey , did you know you could major in antics ?
i checked . you need a tomfoolery pre @-@ req ,
but they waive it for women .
this is lunacy .
we are not gonna start over as freshmen .
hey , there &apos;s a freshman mixer tonight .
are you guys freshmen ?
we can be .
this prank is amazing .
he &apos;s gonna come in here later and
have the creepy feeling someone was in here .
we should go before we get caught .
well , aren &apos;t we gonna do something now that we &apos;re here ?
do something ?
all right .
a prank on a prank .
let &apos;s move everything on his desk
over an inch except his stapler .
then he &apos;ll think we moved his stapler .
oh , my god , there &apos;s so many levels to this .
how about we fill his car with popcorn ?
that sounds messy .
that sounds messy !
okay , keys . keys .
okay , i &apos;m the dean .
i come into my office ,
turn on the light .
&quot; oh , my , did my stapler grow legs and move ? &quot;
then come over here for coffee .
i would hide my keys in ...
heels .
oh , you got skills .
look who got his ball .
not my ball .
your ball .
i just wanted you guys to see it .
new jeff .
jeffrey , is that blood on your shirt ?
oh , no , it &apos;s cool . it &apos;s leonard &apos;s .
two balls !
this is gonna be so good when i finally get it .
it &apos;s a little weird doing this without abed .
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
i &apos;ll put my @-@ my britta twist on it .
i got skills . i got skills .
sorry .
let &apos;s get this started .
we always do the first one together .
one , two , three .
i wish for a great school year .
i wish for 1,000 wishes .
great school year ?
the first wish is always for 1,000 wishes .
but we have all these coins .
yeah , but the coins aren &apos;t the wishes .
oh , i didn &apos;t know that .
i wish for britta to have 499 of my remaining wishes .
thank you .
i wish to end all wars .
that &apos;s another rule .
no wishes containing the word &quot; all . &quot;
guaranteed ironic consequences .
i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s gonna miss wars .
star wars , thumb wars ,
wow , storage wars !
fine .
you can &apos;t get in the fountain .
i &apos;m taking that penny back .
i already told you ,
the pennies aren &apos;t wishes .
you can &apos;t flip a wish .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
your rules are ridiculous .
they &apos;re abed &apos;s rules .
and they &apos;re awesome , and they always work .
well , abed &apos;s not here , so ...
unwish !
you can &apos;t do that .
i just did .
unwish !
no ! rewish .
un @-@ unwish .
give me it ! unwish !
no !
no !
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
what--you &apos;re helping me !
you &apos;re helping . i like it .
unwish ! unwish !
oh , god !
why does this feel good ?
stupid , selfish jeff coming here ,
ruining our senior year .
ah , great ! my &quot; g &quot; s are back .
yes , it &apos;s crummy that jeff is leaving early ,
but we &apos;re all graduating eventually .
but why the rush ?
what , so jeff can run off and be a gross lawyer again ?
troy and abed start drinking coffee ?
i become a boring hospital administrator ?
who wants to do that ?
you do . right ?
yay , hospital administration !
can &apos;t wait to be buried alive
under a pile of paperwork and bed pans ,
just trying to summon the courage to ask out dr. patel ,
and the gorgeous indian neurosurgeon
who doesn &apos;t even know i exist .
this isn &apos;t a conversation , is it ?
the sad , slow march toward death begins .
senioritis !
ready , set ...
third ball .
fourth ball .
well , well , well .
looks like someone wants to be a hero .
a big man . a huge , throbbing , sweaty ...
dean , i just want to get my history credit
and get out of here .
and i just need to know how bad you want it .
the next competition will be particularly difficult
for some of you because ...
it requires complete emotional commitment .
the tango .
i will be the judge .
there can only be one winner ,
so choose your partners wisely .
come on , winger .
it &apos;s water under the bridge , right ?
partners ?
sorry .
my dance card &apos;s full .
for my partner in the tango competition ,
i choose ...
the dean .
the fountain works .
all these balls .
i &apos;m so close , i can taste it .
pierce , only you could turn a freshman mixer into a disaster .
i was this close to getting those two girls .
jeff , look how close you &apos;re holding your fingers together .
that &apos;s your penis .
guys , great news .
after just one forensics class ,
i found a way to retrieve our student records .
it turns out there &apos;s a backup .
and it &apos;s in this safe .
i have a theory , dean .
do tell .
i don &apos;t think you want me to graduate .
don &apos;t be absurd , jeffrey .
i want success for all greendale students .
oh , really ? then answer me this .
what happened to the other history class ?
what other history class ?
the second history class , the one that actually taught history ,
that disappeared from the schedule after i took summer classes .
you &apos;re telling yourself a fantasy .
who really made those counterfeited ice cream tickets ?
who &apos;s so good that they got your handwriting
with its hearts and flourishes ?
oh , god , you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t let you go , jeffrey .
you weren &apos;t supposed to compete .
you were supposed to walk away with the rest of the study group .
you can &apos;t not get rid of me that easily .
oh , god , why &apos;d i make it feats of strength and grace ?
it &apos;s as if i wanted you to win .
but that can &apos;t be true .
smile .
best friends .
so let &apos;s hug it out . okay .
here . one more ball to go .
but it &apos;s another dance contest ,
so i think i got it .
what &apos;s wrong with abed ?
no , no , no , no , don &apos;t open the safe .
we &apos;re redoing our first three years .
that &apos;s what i want .
it &apos;s okay , abed .
here &apos;s a trick i use when i feel overwhelmed .
just imagine a happy place
and then go there .
* greendale babies *
* we &apos;re happy and we &apos;re free *
* greendale babies *
* fun for you and me *
* greendale baby forever *
greendale babies will be right back
forever !
pierce , what did you do to abed ?
gay balls !
nailed it .
don &apos;t ask .
don &apos;t tell .
poor abed . is he in his imagination emporium ?
dreamatorium . no , this seems like something new .
abed was having some anxiety about all the changes this year ,
so i may have told him to
go to a happy place in his mind .
you told him to go somewhere in his mind ?
do you realize who you told that to ?
the last competition to win a red ball
begins in one minute .
honestly , jeff , you can go .
no one will think you &apos;re selfish .
this looks bad .
i wish i hadn &apos;t broken abed .
there is one thing we could try .
oh , okay .
hey , let &apos;s play pretend .
yeah , we could be cowboys .
we could be spacemen .
that &apos;s right , baby pierce . we can play forever .
it &apos;s not working .
what &apos;s not working ?
okay , contestants , final competition begins right now .
god , i hate new jeff .
hey , guys , i have something to say .
yay ! like always !
i was just outside babyville .
there &apos;s nothing outside babyville .
you know what , there is !
and it was scary ,
because change is always scary .
but then i thought of you guys ,
and i wasn &apos;t so scared .
abed , when you brought this group together ,
you changed our lives ,
but then we changed each other .
and we &apos;re gonna keep changing in unexpected ways .
and we &apos;re still gonna be friends ,
even if we don &apos;t all become professors at greendale
or open a restaurant together
or move into the same apartment building after pierce dies .
even if we go somewhere ,
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
that was a killer speech , jeff .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
i literally just walked up .
i know . i made the speech for you .
it hit all the right notes .
i was trying to hang on to this moment
because i was so afraid of the future ,
but then i realized all of this was once the future .
and it was completely different from what i &apos;d known before .
and it was happening so fast .
but in the end , or in the now , i guess ,
it turned out great .
and just like ice cream ,
we &apos;ve melted together and made a new--
i just had to run the scenario to figure it out .
sorry i missed the fountain .
it &apos;s okay .
britta introduced a new rule--
no rules .
cool . we can discuss it .
when they were incepting ,
i got their balls .
well , now that we &apos;re out of &quot; history of ice cream , &quot;
i can finally take &quot; advanced claims denial . &quot;
you should take &quot; forensics . &quot;
can somebody tell me what the hell we just did ?
jeffrey .
jeffrey , wait .
dean , what are you--
you smell like the floor of a movie theater .
yeah , but not for the usual reasons .
i have had the worst day .
our dance photo didn &apos;t come out ,
someone moved my stapler ,
and , worst of all , i hurt you .
but you &apos;ll be happy to know
that we &apos;ll be offering another history class ,
because i care about you .
and not because i found out if we don &apos;t offer a real
history class we &apos;ll lose , like , $ 40,000 in grant money .
thank you , dean .
by the way , you didn &apos;t have to come all this way
to tell me that .
oh , no , it wasn &apos;t a problem .
it &apos;s on my way .
please tell me you &apos;re breaking into that condo .
no , i bought it .
now we &apos;ll be like almost roomies .
oh , good , you got wine . i &apos;ve got friends with benefits .
no subtext .
i don &apos;t know why i was so worried about change .
this year &apos;s gonna be great .
i &apos;ll be right over .
are you sure this is gonna work ?
guaranteed to work . it &apos;s an antic .
ahh ! not so fast , you two .
get ready to run .
in these heels ?
where &apos;d you girls get those dresses ?
they &apos;re fabulous .
they &apos;re charming .
not so fast , mister .
excuse you ?
excuse me . thank you , sir .
not for you .
hello , it &apos;s britta .
okay , i know a man when i see one .
