We've wanted this for so long,
a life without "A,"
and Ali back.
People are preparing for Ali's return
and it's not with flowers and Welcome Home banners.
I'm going back to school.
And if we just stick together, everything is going to be fine.
There was still a girl in that grave.
Someone killed her.
And Jessica was going to say that it was you.
I'm really worried that my dad tried to stop her.
You think that your dad--
Yeah.
And so does my mom.
I mean, she practically admitted it.
I can't stop thinking about Shana's family.
Every time I close my eyes,
all I can see is her grandmother.
You're just going to have to find a way to forgive yourself.
Can't tell if this is Mars or a satellite.
Do you have the coordinates?
It says we're supposed to be dressed
appropriately for the presentation.
Like, business conservative? I'd rather wear vomit.
Okay, but we have to find the planet
so that we can study it.
Hanna?
Look, there's no rule that says
you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.
Well, it's not written down but it's understood.
We're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali
and everyone will think what they've always thought.
Which is what?
That we're her puppets.
But you're not.
So who cares what they think?
People know who you are, Hanna.
They do?
'Cause lately I don't.
Are you still having nightmares about Shana?
I see her everywhere. Everywhere.
It's like she's haunting me for what I did to her.
Look, all right, all right.
This isn't about Shana.
This is you doing this to yourself.
Okay?
I wish I could fix this for you.
And I know it's silly but...
I keep waiting for that "A" message.
You know, that text that's gonna come in
with a picture of me standing over Shana's dead body.
That picture doesn't exist.
You don't have to live in fear of your cell phone anymore.
No? Tell that to my right eye.
It still twitches every time I get a text.
What's she doing out this late?
I don't know.
Since she's been back she's practically lived in her bedroom.
Alison?
Is this a date?
No.
No.
Ali, what are you doing? Who was that?
Oh, my dad forgot my enrollment forms on his desk.
And he's stuck at home on a call,
so his flunky dropped me off.
I guess school is the kind of thing
that my mom handled.
I haven't had a chance to say how sorry I am
about your mom.
Do you want me to talk to your dad?
Good luck finding him.
He's avoiding me like the plague.
Does Alison know?
What you think he did to her mom?
It's not the kind of information
that I want to arm her with
until I know for sure that he did it.
So if action is character, then who is Alison now?
Been reading Fitzgerald?
I've been re-reading Fitzgerald.
I already know Alison's story
but I find it hard to picture her as a victim.
She seems really genuine when she says
that what she's been through changed her.
And I want to believe her.
But you don't.
How can I believe a story that I haven't been told?
I mean, if the truth is in the details,
we still don't know what happened to her.
Spencer, we wouldn't be us
if we didn't believe in second chances.
But it's okay to close the door
on someone if they're toxic.
It's Jenna.
I didn't know you two were talking again.
We're not.
I haven't talk to her since she moved to New York.
Hello.
I'll be right there.
What's going on?
Shana is dead.
She could hardly get out the words,
but Jenna said she was murdered.
I'm sorry, Spence.
Okay, nobody likes lying to Toby.
But if he finds out what happened in New York...
just tell him the truth.
If you're lying to protect me, you don't need to.
It's your decision, Spencer. It's not hers.
Alison, you don't have to stand watch.
Spencer said that Toby was taking her home.
Jenna's not coming here.
He said she sounded broken.
She's still full-on blind, right?
Maybe she came back
'cause she wants to be close to her family.
Hey, no offense, but if she's sad
she could cry in New York.
Let's face it,
we blinded Jenna, we killed her girlfriend.
She's back to punish us for it.
Said with absolutely no tact but you're right.
I had no idea that Jenna was living in New York.
Which means that Shana was lying
when she said that Jenna didn't know that she was after us.
She came home to finish what Shana started.
And I still don't have time for a hobby.
What?
The new normal was supposed to be a carefree senior year.
"A's" dead and we're still plotting
our zone defense in the dark.
You guys have put up with so much to help me.
And I've made a lot of enemies.
But it's not going to be us against them tomorrow.
Just like I'm working to earn back your trust,
I'm going to try and make amends with everyone I hurt.
Does that include Jenna?
I've been through a lot worse.
You can do this.
Maybe she's not coming.
Oh, she's coming.
We should have picked her up.
Why didn't we pick her up?
Her dad wanted to drop her off.
Guys, I don't think she's coming,
I think she's here.
You guys coming this weekend?
Yeah, I'm planning on it.
Once a bitch, always a bitch.
Hey, Ali, remember me?
Do they love her or do they hate her?
I can't tell.
Wait, Ali knows Cindy and Mindy?
Hey, Cindy. Hey, Mindy.
She used to call them "Gayrons."
Gayrons?
Yeah, like gay morons.
So that's the Queen Of Mean?
I can't watch this.
You're leaving?
Ready?
Thanks for waiting for me.
Ali, do you know where your first class is?
I'm supposed to go to the guidance counselor's office.
But I can't remember where it is.
I've got chem lab.
It's close. I can walk with you.
Thanks, Em.
Well, I hope you have a good first day back.
Yeah.
Call us if you need us.
We'll meet up for lunch, okay?
Thanks.
For everything.
I can't believe she's actually back in school.
As abnormal as this is, it kind of feels normal.
Baby steps.
Spencer Hastings,
please report to the office.
Spencer Hastings,
please report to the principal's office.
Mom?
Honey, I'm sorry to have to do this at school.
What's going on?
We have to go home and pack.
What for?
I'm leaving your father...
and you're coming with me.
Let's do something that nobody else in this school is doing today,
talk about somebody other than Alison.
Gladly.
So my girlfriend is coming into town from Philly tonight.
I'm having a party so she can meet all my friends.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
What's she like?
See for yourself.
The party starts at 7.
Can I bring Travis?
Of course.
Great. See you later.
Is Melissa coming with us?
You need a jacket.
And that gray sweater that you love,
let's bring that.
Mom!
Look, I will answer all of your questions
when we get to the hotel.
But right now I need you to stay focused on
helping me get us out of here.
Mom, I need you to be honest with me.
I will help you but I need to understand
what we're running from.
We're not running.
You pulled me out of school
so that we could be gone before Dad gets home.
Does he even know that we're leaving?
Damn it, Spencer. When you latch onto things...
I just want to know the truth!
Your father did take me to a spa.
But I never checked in.
I was working with a private investigator.
Then the night that Jessica was killed,
your dad and Melissa told me that they went to a diner in Ridgeville.
That was a lie.
You think that both of them...
I thought your father and I had an understanding.
We always agreed that, no matter what,
we would never involve you and Melissa in all of the...
All of the what?
Mom?
I want you to know that I'll take care of you.
We'll take care of each other.
Spence, call us back.
We're getting worried.
I haven't seen Ali since first period.
Maybe they skipped.
No, Ali sent a text.
She's in guidance counselor hell.
With everything going on with Spencer's family,
I don't like not knowing where she is.
I was thinking about going to Jenna's after school.
I can swing by Spencer's.
Okay, back up. Why would you be going to Jenna's?
Because I believe what Toby told Spencer.
And if Jenna's broken because of what I did...
I don't know, maybe there's something
I can do to help.
What could you do to help?
Yeah, last night you thought
she was staring blind daggers at you.
Both of you, back off, okay?
I'm just saying, if she's not looking for us
or smelling for us, then
Look, Hanna, I really hope that you find a hobby.
And I hope you have a carefree senior year, Em.
But I've got to find a way to live
with what I did in New York.
Okay, Aria...
I can be sorry for her loss.
All right? That's what I can do.
The glee club's sponsoring Frozsing-a-long tonight.
导致其发挥失常
I think I'm more of an Adele Dazeem than Idina Menzel.
It's free pizza on a school night.
You sure that doesn't trump 20 Questions with your mom?
Is it okay if I hum?
I'll see you at 7?
Yeah.
I'm surprised you came to practice.
I heard you went home early.
I wasn't feeling well. But it passed.
Are you sure you didn't leave because of Alison?
I know she's your friend, but even being
in the same room with her makes me feel sick.
Well, if you're staying out of school to try and avoid her,
then she still has power over you.
Then she still has power over me...
because I can't stand to be in the same room with her.
I hate seeing you so upset.
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
You're one of the bravest people I know,
and I'm not going to let you forget that.
Jenna?
Jenna?
Who's there?
Is someone there?
Do you want me to leave?
It's okay if you stay.
Paige?
It's up to you, Emily.
Thanks for getting us together, Em.
Paige and I are both lucky to have you as a friend.
That's the only thing we have in common.
Paige...
I am ashamed of the way I treated you.
I put people down to...
feel better about myself.
You are a terrible person, Alison.
And I hated you for it.
I didn't care if you were dead.
I was happy you were gone.
I'm sorry.
For what you did to me or for yourself?
For all of it.
I can't believe you can think about homework tonight.
And that you would trust me to give you your assignments.
You were actually the first person
that I thought of when she said that she was leaving him.
'Cause I remembered how hard it was for you
when your dad left.
I can't believe he'd risk everything to kill Mrs. D.
The police were asking questions about
the girl that was in Ali's grave...
and he was just trying to protect me.
He thought Mrs. D. Was gonna set me up to take the fall for it.
Travis is downstairs.
Spencer, I saw your mom at The Bradbury yesterday.
Is everything okay at home?
Yeah, we're just having plumbing issues.
Ohh. Well, tell Veronica we're here to help
if you need anything.
Thanks, Mrs. Marin.
Spence, you could have told her the truth.
Not about the murder part,
but about your parents splitting up.
She would never judge that.
I'm not really even sure why I lied.
I know that we've never really been
like a warm and fuzzy family,
but I always thought that my parents were gonna stay together.
We're here for you, Spence.
I promise.
You want to order some food?
Uh, I already have plans.
It's a school thing.
Can I tag along?
I invited Paige.
So...
Yeah, I get it.
So I'm sure this sounds lame, but do you care
if I stay for a little bit?
My dad's working late, and I just...
I don't want to go home to an empty house.
Yeah.
My mom's in the den if you need anything.
Em?
When I was talking to Paige
I realized that I owe you an apology, too.
I always made you think that your feelings for me
were totally one-sided.
That wasn't true.
Those kisses weren't just for practice.
I don't know what you want me to say.
You don't have to say anything.
Why are you telling me this now?
I just thought you should know.
Caleb?
What are you doing here?
Hey, blondie, come hang out with us.
Could you keep it down, Biff?
This is a coffee shop, not the locker room.
You looking for a fight, man?
No, no. He's just a little bit irritable.
He hasn't had his coffee yet.
Caleb, when did you get back?
Two coffees for Hanna.
And...why haven't you called me?
Hanna.
Better get your coffees.
Caleb, where are you?
Why aren't you answering my calls? Are you mad at me?
Can you just call me back so I can find you?
You dropped your phone.
Thank you.
God, this punch is so tasty.
It's best consumed rapidly and repeatedly.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So, Lucas,
where is your girlfriend?
I...don't see her right now.
Are you sure that she's even real?
Oh, she's real, all right.
Lucas, you're doing it with her!
Hanna. Shh!
Okay, now that is consumed best rapidly and repeatedly.
Whoa, you okay?
Hey, cowboy, where have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.
You're the one that's been on your phone all night, Hanna.
Lset me rub that bald head of yours.
Okay, come on.
I think you've had enough.
Actually, you don't know what I think.
You don't even know the half of it.
Come on, come on.
Oh, there we go.
Did I just say that you don't even know the half of it?
Here you go.
Bridget Woo just told me she saw Jenna tonight.
She's probably drunk.
Jenna or Bridget?
Bridget.
Bridget.
She also told me Shana's dead.
Who are these people?
Jenna's a blind girl who used to go to our school.
Her and Shana were dating, right?
I don't know what they were.
You don't like her?
Alison and Jenna hated each other.
My friends and I didn't realize we had been
drafted into their war before it was too late.
Too late for what?
Three minutes till show time, folks.
Find your seats and your duet partners.
So are you Anna or Elsa?
I'm humming.
I knew it was you in my room today.
You scared me.
What were you doing in my house?
Do you want to--
Do you want to come inside? I can make some tea.
What I would like is an answer.
I heard about Shana.
So I was just coming to see if you were okay.
Why would you care if I'm okay?
Look, with Ali back, it's just--
It's bringing up a lot of stuff for everyone, and...
we all feel really terrible about our part in the accident.
I was--
Placating your guilt?
Jenna...
Look, I might be the last person on earth
that you want to talk to right now.
But for two years, we felt that Alison was dead.
So I know how it feels to lose someone.
Right.
But you still have your friends.
I don't have anybody left.
Right, but I guess that is nobody's fault
but my own.
Are you sure you don't want to come in for that tea?
I didn't really know Shana that well,
but if you...
if you wanted to come in and talk
and tell me about her...
I think that would help.
Thank you, Aria.
Yeah.
求救 我在教堂
You don't scare me, Mona.
You're not as good of a liar as you used to be.
I know you were all in New York
the night Shana was murdered.
And I can prove it.
What do you want, Mona?
What I've always wanted--
and that's for you to leave town.
I don't care where you go or how you get there.
I want you gone.
I'm not a threat to you.
You may have convinced Hanna and the others
that you changed.
And maybe you are trying to be a decent person,
but that won't last for long.
People do change.
When someone shows me who they are,
I believe them.
I don't need to be taught a lesson more than once.
You're suddenly the victim of what, Mona?
My bullying?
What do you call what you did to those girls?
You almost killed Hanna.
No one feels worse about that than I do.
But I'm all better now. Even the doctors say so.
I don't believe you.
If you could prove that we were in New York,
you would have done it already.
I'm back and I'm staying, so get used to it.
No one wants you here.
You're wrong, Mona.
Just like before, everyone wants to be my friend.
And that's what you're afraid of.
All I had to do was say "I'm sorry" to Cindy and Mindy
and they were practically begging me
to sit at their lunch table.
You're scared because you know that
it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once,
and you know I can do it again.
We don't have to do this.
Leave me alone.
你还好吗
Hey, Han, we're all at Ali's.
You might be asleep, but just call us when you get this.
I don't think it was a coincidence
that all of you were busy tonight.
Did you see who was driving?
It couldn't have been Mona.
She got into that church way too fast.
She had help.
Sounds like an ambush.
You're shaking.
Hey, here.
Well, what did you do when she slapped you?
I just stared at her.
Look, I think you're right.
If Mona had any proof that we were in New York,
she would have used it by now.
She was just trying to scare you.
Well, she succeeded.
I would be madder than a skunk at Travis
if he weren't as baffled by your behavior as I am.
When you sober up we're having a serious talk about consequences.
And yours won't just be a hangover.
Okay, mother.
But if you don't stop spinning the room, I'm going to throw up.
Thanks for not being mad at me.
Oh, I'm mad at you, Hanna.
But I know you won't remember,
so we'll talk about it tomorrow.
Okay, mother.
Why would you do this to yourself?
Caleb's back.
Ali's really missing her mom tonight.
Okay. I will.
She's okay with me staying over.
She said to give you a big hug.
You probably don't remember
what I told you when I pulled you out of that barn.
I remember every word...
but I don't know what's real and what I made up.
You said you missed me the most.
You were the hardest one to leave behind.
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I-- I know that there's no more "A,"
but you should seriously still lock your door.
You stopped by Paula's?
Yeah, it's key lime.
Why pie?
Why not pie?
Jenna's all alone now.
She's all alone, and she's blaming herself.
I just wanted to tell her that she should blame me.
You should both be blaming Shana.
She was the one that was holding the gun, remember?
Ali, she always thought that Jenna was manipulating Shana,
but I think that Jenna actually loved her.
Look, Aria, you have to stop beating yourself up for this.
I don't know how I'm going to get past it.
Do you see this?
This is what she did to me.
I'm lucky to be alive, and so are you.
Just like she told you, remember?
Shana wasn't playing a game.
I'm so sorry.
I don't ever want to hear you say
you're sorry again.
Ali? Are you asleep?
Does that hurt?
I can handle it.
If you feel as bad as you look--
Not so loud.
So how does Mona know that we were in New York?
She's Mona.
But how did she send that "New York minute" text
to your burner phone the night we got back into town?
The other day I learned
how to make my own satellite on the Web.
What are you going to do with a satellite?
The point is that you can learn to do anything on the Web.
Using a Bluetooth sniper rifle,
the hacker can receive signals
from a thousand yards away.
You can be blue-snarfed in seconds,
and the entire contents of your phone will be
wirelessly uploaded.
So Mona blue-snarfed us?
What's going on?
Some people really did hope that you changed.
We're not afraid of you, Mona.
Afraid of me?
What lies has she told you?
Alison attacked me last night.
And when she started saying things
like she could make me disappear,
I turned my phone to video.
You're scared
because you know it's not gonna take me long
to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once
and you know I can do it again.
It's...
That is the last time I underestimate that bitch.
How are you going to try and spin this one, Ali?
I mean, we know you're a great liar,
so I'm sure this is going to be a good one.
Everything I told you last night was true.
She slapped me first. I swear it.
I didn't tell you that I slapped her back
because I felt terrible about it.
"Loser Mona"? Really?
Are we back to that again?
I know how it looks.
But you know what she's capable of.
I mean, she set me up.
Come on, guys.
Mona's found a lot of ways to trick us
into believing things were real when they're not.
I mean, Spence, you landed in Radley
because of one of those elaborate stunts she pulled.
Maybe Mona deserved it.
But you went out of your way to lie to us.
Again.
Nice car.
It used to be mine.
They don't want things to go back to the way they were.
They remember how Alison treated them.
Like they were her dolls.
Good.
Then maybe we can really get rid of her.
So what does a world without "A" Look like?
Well, it turns out the Hastings don't need "A"
to make a mess of things.
We can do that all on our own.
Are you mad at me for waiting so long to tell you?
Spence, get over here.
All I want you to know is that you're never alone.
Not even for a second.
I thought I'd find you here.
Why haven't you returned my calls?
Travis is a nice guy.
I didn't come back to screw that up.
So why did you come back?
Did you change your hair because Alison's back?
Probably.
Em, I know I screwed up.
Em, will you look at me please?
Why wouldn't you just tell us the truth?
It's so much easier than lying.
I didn't tell you everything because I was afraid
that I was gonna lose you.
Please.
That's not going to fix this.
There is breaking news tonight
in the investigation of the Jane Doe
who was buried in Alison DiLaurentis's grave.
We expect the Rosewood Police Department
to make a statement regarding the identity
of the murdered girl.
Did Miranda find her family?
I don't know.
The night you left Ravenswood was the last time I saw her.
You have to come with me.
We gotta go.
Caleb, come on.
...the Rosewood police chief
will be making a statement any moment now,
Guys, it's starting.
announcing the identity of the body
found in the Delaurentis backyard 2 years ago.
This mystery has continued to haunt Rosewood
as the murder has never been solved.
And this announcement is
right on the heels of the more recent murder
of Alison's mother Jessica DeLaurentis.
And not only that, the police department
is under a lot of pressure right now
as these are not the only murders...
Are they together now?
Have you been drinking again?
I had one sip of beer.
Oh, here he comes, we're going live.
We take you now to the Rosewood police chief.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I've called this press conference
because we received confirmation tonight
that the name of the victim that was buried alive
on the Dilaurentis property
was Bethany Young.
She was a 17-year-old patient at the Radley Institution
and was believed
to have run away from the hospital on the night
that Alison Dilaurentis was allegedly kidnapped.
Did they just say "Allegedly"?
The victim's parents have been notified
and the family is requesting at this time
that you respect their privacy and allow them
to grieve over the loss of their loved one.
There will be no comments and no questions--
Oh, my God!
What the hell was that?!
Are you okay?
Guys, what just happened?
Oh, my God.
My God.
Toby...
...your house.
Was there anyone in there?
Toby, stay here! Please!
That's the last box.
Welcome home.
All units in the vicinity,
please respond to an explosion at 47 Serenity Lane.
Ambulances and paramedics are en route.
