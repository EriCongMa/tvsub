maura , that was an amazing farewell meal .
well , i had help from the guest of honor .
he &apos;s a remarkable sous @-@ chef .
didn &apos;t even know what that was till this afternoon .
tommy , the vegetables were delicious .
ma , he sliced a celery stalk .
i cut up the broccoli , too .
okay , so , when do we get to see
this fabulous apartment of yours ?
soon as i have the money to get the lights turned on .
well , i told you i &apos;d be happy to cosign .
no .
no .
no .
but if you need help moving in ...
actually , i moved in today .
a buddy of mine helped me .
look at him . my baby &apos;s leaving the nest again .
and this time , he &apos;s on the straight and narrow .
your baby &apos;s 32 .
stop it .
you &apos;re back .
yeah .
we really didn &apos;t get a chance to talk .
i &apos;m gonna miss our chess games .
me too .
anyway , a token of my appreciation .
this is a 1994 chateau de gordes .
it &apos;s very rare .
yeah ...
like you .
i should finish these dishes .
yeah . okay .
well , good night .
wait , tommy .
no , i got to go anyway .
um , enjoy the wine .
you &apos;ve been so great to me .
tommy ...
everybody on the ground ! facedown ! now !
you trip the silent , i blow his head off ! get up !
if i don &apos;t see cash from that vault
in 30 seconds , you die .
move it !
get up ! get up !
empty the cash in the drawers . you two , don &apos;t move !
come on !
fill it .
give me the bag .
get on the ground . don &apos;t move .
come on . come on , come on !
let &apos;s get out of here .
go !
go ! go ! go !
what do we got ?
dead bank manager .
three employees witnessed the robbery and the shooting .
fbi &apos;s inside talking to them .
what are you doing out here ?
the fbi has a pretty high opinion of itself
and a pretty low one of local law enforcement .
they let maura and korsak in .
to process the body .
well , come on . the action &apos;s inside .
no . i &apos;ll wait out here .
it &apos;s good .
you were here when it started ?
yeah .
excuse me . i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli ,
boston homicide .
can you direct me to the agent in charge ?
you &apos;re looking at her .
special agent anna farrell .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m used to it .
a girl running the task force ?
gee , it never happens to me .
jane .
i &apos;ve allowed your superior and the medical examiner in
while we interview the witnesses .
okay . well , it may be your bank robbery ,
but it &apos;s our murder .
you can never have too many detectives .
actually , you can .
a neighboring p.d. managed to bungle
a similar investigation two weeks ago .
yeah , i heard about cambridge .
it &apos;s always amateur hour when campus police are involved .
boston &apos;s the real deal . okay ?
so , you think it &apos;s the same crew that did the cambridge robbery .
appears to be .
they made off with 30 grand in that robbery .
today &apos;s take was almost $ 100,000 .
why &apos;s the window shattered ?
they went out that way .
door in cambridge had a sensor .
it triggered a time @-@ delayed transmitter hidden in the money .
what was the time delay on the dye pack ?
10 seconds .
we figure it went off in the getaway vehicle .
they &apos;re smarter this time ...
and more lethal .
witnesses say he didn &apos;t resist .
didn &apos;t try to set off an alarm .
so why &apos;d they shoot him ?
who is he ?
paul lanford , 34 .
suffered what appears to be
a single gunshot wound to the chest .
oh . that &apos;s a shame .
what ?
quite a bit of intra @-@ abdominal fat .
it &apos;s belly fat
you know , it &apos;s linked to high cholesterol ,
high insulin levels .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s worried
about his cholesterol level , maura .
i found a witness who got the first three digits
of the van &apos;s license - 82e .
i &apos;ll put out a bolo .
i already did .
detective frost , this is ...
i should go check in with my team .
what was that ?
stared at her like she was a perp .
you think he stared ?
casual fixation with no attention to detail ?
i think he scrutinized - close , attentive examination .
a tad hostile for our friend barry .
i think they &apos;ve met before .
couldn &apos;t have been on the job .
otherwise , i would have met her , too .
maybe it was when he was in uniform .
it seemed personal .
did you get the sense that they &apos;d slept together ?
i &apos;m not very good at figuring out
who &apos;s sleeping with whom .
stick with what you &apos;re good at .
what does his body tell you ?
the track of the projectile is through the right lung ,
into the heart ...
and through the left lung .
and there it is at the fifth intercostal .
oh . it &apos;s a .40 caliber .
the bank robber shot him at point @-@ blank range .
he was cooperating . why would he do that ?
perhaps your suspect has
a smaller amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
it results in poor impulse control .
not everyone with a small brain shoots people .
you sound like my mom making excuses for tommy .
&quot; his dyslexia made him do it . &quot;
have you heard from him ?
who - tommy ? no .
just wondering if he got turned on .
the lights .
got his lights turned on .
b.p.d. unit found the getaway van .
oh , that &apos;s great !
no , it &apos;s not .
the fbi is sitting on it .
why are they running surveillance ?
this is bullshit .
i want that thing processed . come on .
feds .
always make it that much harder for us to do our jobs .
she dumped your ass , didn &apos;t she ?
when and where ?
oh , about three years ago at the corner
of &quot; none of your business &quot; and &quot; don &apos;t ask . &quot;
oh .
agent farrell .
detective rizzoli .
detective frost .
we &apos;re running a surveillance operation .
why are you here ?
you really think they &apos;re coming back
to ride around in a van they used in a bank robbery ?
the plates on the van
were stolen from a mall last night .
we &apos;ve been sitting on it for an hour .
it &apos;s been dumped .
and we need to get our people from the crime lab
in that van .
no . we &apos;re sitting tight .
great .
well , you sit tight and watch that empty van
while our killers are out there
robbing banks and shooting people .
okay , what happened between you two ?
he , uh , wouldn &apos;t put the toilet seat down .
okay .
can i take a look ?
sure .
thank you .
frost !
wait ! what are you doing ! ?
frost !
police !
95.6 .
liver temp indicates he &apos;s been dead about two hours .
csru says the van &apos;s been wiped down pretty clean .
no prints on the wheel or doors .
okay . let &apos;s get latent prints out here ,
see what they can find .
perhaps this will help .
a hair .
do you see a root ball ?
yes .
i &apos;ll have it run through codis .
blood spatter indicates he was shot inside this van .
this is strange @-@ looking blood .
do you see why i will only commit to
a reddish @-@ brown stain ?
this is not blood .
well , what is it , then , dr. smarty pants ?
paint .
yeah .
see ? i see flecks of avocado green ,
tiffany blue ...
enough , picasso .
okay . so , this van was used for
commercial painting at some point .
agent farrell , look .
you see the red spray on the roof ?
they tried to wipe it off .
yeah . that &apos;s from the dye pack .
must be from the cambridge robbery .
i &apos;m gonna run this van number .
well , if we &apos;re lucky ,
it &apos;ll be registered to the dead guy .
do you recognize him ?
he was on our list of suspects .
john polk , 31 .
convicted of bank robbery --
released last spring after serving 10 years .
that &apos;s ricky dunn , his partner in that robbery --
also recently paroled .
huh . i &apos;m thinking they reunited .
frost , bring up the bank surveillance footage .
how tall was john polk ?
6 &apos; 2 . &quot;
and what about ricky dunn ?
5 &apos; 7 . &quot;
got it .
freeze it .
well , that looks about right , don &apos;t you think ?
john polk , our 6 &apos; 2 &quot; dead guy , is the shooter .
ricky dunn is his 5 &apos; 7 &quot; accomplice .
what do you know about dunn ?
we checked with his parole officer .
he hasn &apos;t reported in for the last two weeks .
so , when you told us he was &quot; on your list , &quot;
he was really your prime suspect .
do we need to speak privately , detective frost ?
no , i &apos;m good .
well , that &apos;s quite a history .
ricky dunn is prone to violence .
history of drug use , gambling .
but not john polk .
he came from a middle @-@ class home .
no drug use , no violence .
till he robbed a bank with dunn .
but this time , polk kills the bank manager . why ?
got nervous .
accidentally pulled the trigger .
yeah , maybe .
frost , can you slow it down ?
so , polk turns to go ,
but then he turns back .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s making a decision .
yeah .
to kill him .
frost , try a search with both names --
john polk and paul lanford .
you think they knew each other ?
mm @-@ hmm .
if they did , this is an inside job .
yeah . look .
robber and bank manager played
on the same all @-@ star hockey team .
maybe paul lanford got the job at the bank
to set the whole thing up .
detective frost , can you check lanford &apos;s
credit report ? i &apos;m already doing it .
you think polk double @-@ crossed lanford ?
maybe .
he was already splitting the money with his partner , dunn ,
plus the getaway driver .
okay .
so , maxed out on his cards .
behind on all his payments .
serious debt .
lanford need to rob his own bank .
this will be awkward , then .
paul lanford &apos;s widow is in the conference room .
be right there .
i &apos;m going .
frost , you coming ?
i &apos;ll sit this one out .
mrs. lanford ?
we &apos;re sorry for your loss .
if it &apos;s all right with you ,
we &apos;d like to ask you some questions about your husband .
okay .
can you tell us how long paul worked at the bank ?
just a few months .
he &apos;d been unemployed for a year .
things were finally looking up .
do you know this man ?
john polk .
no .
why ?
your husband did .
they played hockey together .
i &apos;m confused . this was years ago .
but both were in the bank when it was robbed this morning ,
and now both are dead .
my husband was at his job .
what are you saying ?
we have reason to believe
that he may have been involved in the robbery .
he was killed by the robbers .
we &apos;ve looked into your financial records .
paul would never do anything illegal .
you were having some serious troubles .
please understand
that we just need to explore all the possibilities .
i understand .
but i don &apos;t understand her .
let &apos;s get these out of here .
tactful warmth isn &apos;t my strong suit .
you &apos;re amazing .
oh . well , i &apos;ve just been at it a long time .
a lots of families , a lot of grief .
i don &apos;t think paul lanford had anything to do with it . you ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i hope i didn &apos;t screw that up .
go easy on yourself , all right ?
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;ll get there .
you okay ? that doesn &apos;t look good .
just something i have to handle right away .
all right .
let me know if something develops in the case .
sure thing .
john polk &apos;s parents are on a cruise .
found a brother - david .
we &apos;re gonna have to do a notification .
okay . i &apos;ll go with you .
i like her .
so did frost - a lot .
look what i found .
they were engaged ?
no wonder he &apos;s so grumpy .
man with a lot of secrets .
come on .
let &apos;s go tell john polk &apos;s brother the bad news .
* the wheels on the bus go &apos; round and &apos; round *
* &apos; round and &apos; round *
* &apos; round and &apos; round *
hang on , kids .
can i help you ?
yeah . hi . we &apos;re looking for a david polk .
that &apos;s me .
could we speak to you in private , please ?
i &apos;ll watch phoebe .
phoebe ,
honey , i want you to go with miss sophie .
play with timmy so daddy can talk , okay ?
i &apos;m sergeant korsak . this is detective rizzoli .
are you able to reach your parents ?
no . they &apos;re traveling . what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s about your brother , john .
what &apos;d he do this time ?
he &apos;s a suspect in a bank robbery that occurred this morning .
he just got out of prison .
if you &apos;re looking for him ,
i don &apos;t know where he is .
we &apos;re sorry to tell you ...
your brother john was shot and killed .
what ?
oh , my god .
who shot him ?
we think it was connected to the bank robbery .
do you know this man --
paul lanford ?
yeah .
i helped coach the hockey team my brother
and paul played on .
i couldn &apos;t play &apos; cause my achilles tendon snapped .
paul was a manager at the bank .
&quot; was &quot; ?
he was killed during the robbery .
did my brother do that ?
do you know this man ?
yeah .
ricky dunn .
i warned my brother to stay away from ricky .
10 years of hard time they did .
i told john , &quot; stay away from all your ex @-@ con buddies . &quot;
do you know any of the names of those ex @-@ cons ?
we believe there was a third person involved in the robbery .
no .
my brother and i lived in two totally different worlds .
daddy .
i &apos;m sorry . my daughter needs me .
i &apos;ll try to find my parents .
thank you .
red particulate .
residue from the exploded dye pack .
it &apos;s still moist , which is curious
since the first bank robbery was two weeks ago .
dr. isles , i &apos;d like you
to take a look at the latent @-@ print findings .
on the van ? you got a hit ?
three , actually .
you should have the report .
john polk &apos;s prints were on the gas cap .
ricky dunn &apos;s were on the interior ceiling .
we found a third partial print on the rear @-@ view mirror .
presumably the van &apos;s driver ?
yes .
it &apos;s not here .
i have the only hard copy .
this can &apos;t be right .
it &apos;s tommy .
this matter is under investigation
by a federal grand jury .
by virtue of title 18 , rule 6e ,
neither you nor any member of your team
is to disseminate any information
about said individual as it relates to this case
under penalty of prosecution .
okay . there has to be some other explanation .
none of this is to be shared with anyone in boston p.d.
that includes the suspect &apos;s sister ,
detective jane rizzoli .
sign here .
prison tats
we notified his brother at a &quot; mommy and me &quot; class .
can &apos;t believe they &apos;re from the same family .
birth order is a significant factor .
the oldest child is typically highly motivated , like you ,
while the youngest -- - robs banks ?
i was gonna say , uh , they tend to be coddled .
pick interests diametrically opposite
to their older siblings .
tend to be ... risk @-@ takers .
oh , i see you &apos;ve read the rizzoli family study .
have you heard from tommy yet ?
no .
and that &apos;s the second time you &apos;ve asked me .
look who &apos;s coddling .
are you okay ? you &apos;re acting weird .
mmm . stomachache .
you don &apos;t have stomachaches .
you have
gastro @-@ stomach @-@ opolitis aches .
from what ?
gastralgia ... from stress .
so stop staring at whatever &apos;s under that microscope .
it &apos;s the hair i found in john polk &apos;s coveralls .
we got a dna match in codis .
it belongs to ricky dunn .
well , that &apos;s no surprise .
we know that john polk and ricky dunn
liked robbing banks together .
the crime lab also found a trace compound on it --
zinc stearate .
which is ?
it &apos;s a chief ingredient in fanning powder .
fanning powder ? wh--
they use that on decks of cards .
to decrease friction , yes .
yeah , the fbi profile on dunn
said he was prone to gambling .
and he &apos;s got his share of 100,000 bucks to launder .
hang on a second . hey , frost .
i want to know about every
underground gambling operation in boston --
dice , cards , whatever .
okay . thanks .
i got to go .
how bad is this stomachache ?
bad .
i &apos;m gonna finish up here and go home .
all right . i &apos;ll call you later .
maura .
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
what are you doing here ?
look , maura ...
sometimes i do stupid , crazy things .
i feel -- i feel terrible .
i &apos;m really sorry .
tommy , you are in serious trouble .
what , did you tell jane ? does she know ?
i can &apos;t discuss this with you . i --
fbi ! get your hands up !
get your hands up !
tommy ! stop ! you &apos;re hurting him !
get off me ! i didn &apos;t do anything .
let him go !
let &apos;s go .
get off me ! i didn &apos;t do anything !
wait ! tommy !
i didn &apos;t do anything !
tommy !
all right .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s hit him quick .
dunn &apos;s got a history of violence .
get those hands up !
it &apos;s dunn !
i got him . i got him ! i got him !
let me see your hands .
i &apos;m not going back to prison .
drop your weapon , dunn .
is that ricky dunn ?
yeah .
he &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s two .
just leaves the getaway driver .
we just took him into custody .
his prints were discovered in the van by the latent team .
really ?
who is he ?
another ex @-@ con --
tommy rizzoli .
does jane know ?
damn it !
you didn &apos;t tell her ? !
maura ...
second @-@ degree mid @-@ dermal burns from the exploding dye pack .
yeah , that &apos;s what you do -- you hide behind science .
you knew the fbi was about to arrest tommy .
check your messages .
i called you the second that i could .
you should have called me before he was arrested .
look , title 18 forbids me from
i don &apos;t give a damn about title 18 !
there are ways to tell me without telling me .
really ?
well , the justice department could have indicted me
for the mere act of disclosing my knowledge
of their intent to arrest tommy .
that is 10 years in a federal prison ,
plus the loss of my medical license .
you didn &apos;t trust me enough to protect you .
and you didn &apos;t protect me .
jane ...
and what is this ?
farrell tells me that you were with him when he was arrested .
i can &apos;t wait to hear the explanation for that .
oh , no . i &apos;m sorry . i forgot .
you can &apos;t talk to me .
he found me in the parking lot .
he wanted to apologize .
oh , yeah ? &quot; hi , maura .
i &apos;m sorry i was the getaway driver in a bank robbery .
sorry somebody got gunned down . &quot;
i think he wanted to apologize for trying to kiss me .
what , did tommy make you sign a title 18 , too ?
we were embarrassed , okay ?
i thought it &apos;d be better if we just forgot about it .
jane , farrell got to cavanaugh .
i &apos;m sorry . he made me and korsak the lead on the two homicides .
okay .
you see that , maura ?
that &apos;s what friends do .
they tell you .
excuse me .
i have to go check on something .
uh , i &apos;m off the case , frost .
my brother is a suspect .
this is all farrell . you know what ? she doesn &apos;t even --
what the hell went down between you two ?
she married the job instead of me .
this is her fault .
she &apos;s just doing her job .
so was maura .
what , did farrell make you sign a title 18 , too ?
no . she made dr. isles , didn &apos;t she ?
i &apos;m going to talk to david polk .
jane , you can &apos;t .
i &apos;m not going as a cop .
i &apos;m going as tommy &apos;s sister .
thanks for seeing me , mr. polk .
no . please , call me david .
sorry about the mess .
phoebe &apos;s with her mom today .
we &apos;re , uh ... separated .
i &apos;m a really bad housekeeper .
it &apos;s fine .
please don &apos;t worry about it .
i was just wondering if you would look at a picture
and -- and ... tell me if you recognize this person .
yeah .
that &apos;s one of john &apos;s ex @-@ con buddies .
he &apos;s my brother .
was he part of the robbery crew ?
it &apos;s looking that way .
the fbi thinks
that he was possibly the getaway driver .
i &apos;m sorry .
does it help that i know exactly how you feel ?
i just never thought i &apos;d be on this side of this , you know .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
at least you can still ask your brother why .
i need to talk to you .
give us a minute .
i told you you couldn &apos;t see him .
let me talk to him , please .
all i can give you is two minutes .
thanks .
jane . thank god .
why ?
how could you be a part of this ?
that bank manager is dead .
john polk is dead , too .
god , tommy ...
jane , are you crying ? don &apos;t cry .
i &apos;m not crying .
i didn &apos;t do this !
your fingerprints are all over the rear @-@ view mirror ...
in the getaway van .
john let me use his van to move .
john was my friend .
that &apos;s why my prints were there .
then what about ricky dunn ?
he &apos;s john polk &apos;s partner .
they used to rob banks together .
did you know him , too ?
not all of us ex @-@ cons know each other .
tell me where you were yesterday morning .
i was in my new place , sleeping .
it &apos;s a crap alibi , but it &apos;s the truth .
and why did you borrow a van
from a convicted bank robber ?
john served his time .
he was starting a house @-@ painting business .
he was working his ass off to turn his life around .
he asked me to work a job with him --
a house @-@ painting job .
jane , i told them all this .
they don &apos;t believe me .
but i thought you would .
time &apos;s up .
all right , all right !
tommy , look at me .
did you do this ?
no .
then i won &apos;t let you go back to prison .
i promise .
he said john polk was painting a house
during the time of the robbery .
we found paint in polk &apos;s van .
if john polk was still alive ,
i &apos;d be charging him with bank robbery and felony murder ,
just like your brother .
what if he &apos;s telling the truth ?
that &apos;s for a jury to decide .
i &apos;m sorry .
too bad you can &apos;t live in your microscopic world .
makes more sense than the macro world right now .
yeah .
my brother &apos;s facing a life sentence .
the faint red that you noted in the van
is disperse red 9 aerosol .
it was the dye pack .
so , the same paint you found under polk &apos;s nails .
uh , no . that is an oil @-@ based paint .
a house paint ?
yes .
i found the same paint particulates in his nostrils .
the moisture levels indicate that he &apos;d been painting
within the last 24 hours .
so tommy was telling the truth .
john was painting yesterday morning .
if he was doing that , he couldn &apos;t possibly be robbing a bank .
unlike electrons ,
human beings can &apos;t be in two places at once .
physical laws of quantum mechanics .
i kind of love that you know that .
you do ? so , you don &apos;t hate me ?
no . i still hate you .
okay .
i &apos;ll work on hating you , too .
wait a minute .
the only one that we know for sure who robbed that bank
was ricky dunn .
what if tommy and john had nothing to do with it ?
my stomachache would go away .
yeah , me too . wh--
can you isolate the manufacturer of that red paint
and find out where it was being used ?
if we prove that john was painting ,
then at least a piece of tommy &apos;s story is true .
there are 285 shades of red .
multiply 285 by the names
that paint companies assign to the shades -- really .
yes .
good .
and i &apos;ll do my gumshoe thing .
there &apos;s only like , you know , 3,000 streets in boston .
i kind of love that you can do that .
then i hate you a little bit less .
i think we still have two bank robbers out there .
i got to go .
jane ...
do you know how long you &apos;re going to hate me for ?
it &apos;s too soon to tell .
they got tommy &apos;s fingerprints .
and he &apos;s a convicted felon .
tommy &apos;s fingerprints are in the van
because he was moving his stuff .
and he called john
because he needed to borrow that van .
20 calls ?
they &apos;re friends .
plus , john was trying to find tommy some work .
don &apos;t put on mom &apos;s rose @-@ colored glasses , jane .
please .
just hear me out , all right ?
what if ricky dunn borrowed john &apos;s van , too ?
but not to move -- to rob a bank .
okay . we know the robbery went bad .
paul lanford gets killed .
yeah , and paul was john &apos;s old friend from hockey .
you know , john hears about the robbery ,
hears about paul &apos;s murder .
maybe he confronts ricky .
ricky panics , kills john , frames him .
leaves the body with the mask in the getaway vehicle .
how does any of this prove that tommy didn &apos;t do it ?
it doesn &apos;t .
it &apos;s colonial red .
you i.d. &apos; d the paint on john polk &apos;s body ?
yes . it &apos;s very expensive .
used primarily on doors and trim
in historic home renovations .
okay .
there are only three neighborhoods
with colonial houses still standing .
what do you need us to do ?
patrol &apos;s got no houses
getting painted red in the north end .
nothing in haymarket either .
keep units going up and down every block of boston .
b.r.i.c. rizzoli .
okay . hang on a second . i &apos;m gonna put you on speaker .
it &apos;s frankie . he says he &apos;s got something .
okay . go ahead .
we found the house . it &apos;s in dorchester .
give me the address .
1772 mayfair drive .
got a foreman who will testify that john polk was here painting
during the time of the robbery .
thank you , frankie .
you were right . john didn &apos;t do it .
yeah , but now we got to prove tommy didn &apos;t either .
but first we got to find two bank robbers
who are still out there .
can you play the bank @-@ robbery tape again ?
it gets me every time --
he shoots an innocent man ,
but he walks away like he &apos;s got all the time in the world .
i still say it looks like they knew each other .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense
now that we know that that &apos;s not john polk .
can you rewind it and slow it down ?
why ? what are you seeing ?
a physical reason for his deliberate pace .
there .
i don &apos;t see anything .
wait .
that &apos;s it .
watch lanford &apos;s eyes .
he looks down ... at polk &apos;s ankle .
achilles tendon , actually .
it ruptured and atrophied when it healed .
that &apos;s what causes his slight limp . you see it ?
yeah . lanford saw it , too .
polk must have felt lanford watching him
and realized that lanford recognized him from his limp .
john polk and david polk were the same size , same build .
it &apos;s david polk , the good brother .
the one who stopped playing hockey
when his achilles tendon snapped .
thanks .
david polk dropped phoebe off 20 minutes ago and took off .
she said he did the same thing two days ago .
the day of the bank robbery . mm @-@ hmm .
and i think i know who the driver is --
carl parker . the other dad we saw ?
apparently , he left with polk - both times .
hey , pull up david polk and carl parker &apos;s credit reports .
david polk declared bankruptcy last year .
he &apos;s divorced .
oh , man .
both polk and carl parker lost their houses .
first bank they hit foreclosed on carl parker &apos;s house .
and the second one turned down polk for a small business loan .
look at the bank that took polk &apos;s home .
copley square bank .
call farrell . get fbi over there .
emergency dispatch to copley square bank .
oh , crap . it &apos;s already on .
come on .
he shot a hostage ?
he demanded a helicopter . he didn &apos;t get it .
how many hostages ?
half a dozen .
there &apos;s a second suspect .
sniper hit him ?
yes .
were we right ? is it carl parker ?
matches his description .
the one who shot the hostage is probably david polk .
damn it .
all right . let me talk to them .
no .
that hostage is bleeding out .
unless you &apos;ve got a helicopter getting them , i &apos;m going in .
jane , don &apos;t even think about it .
forget it .
we need a go on that shot .
this is special agent anna farrell . take the shot .
you don &apos;t have a shot . he &apos;s got a human shield .
jane , don &apos;t !
what the hell is she doing ? !
tell your snipers to stand down !
stand down , stand down .
stand down . all teams , hold fire .
i &apos;m unarmed . it &apos;s all right .
okay . my name is detective jane rizzoli .
i @-@ i am unarmed .
i just want to talk .
stay back !
okay , okay .
this woman needs medical treatment .
all right ?
please . you can take me instead of her , okay ?
look . please don &apos;t let her die .
stay back .
david ...
... don &apos;t let her die .
bringing the hostage out now .
it &apos;s okay .
i know why you &apos;re doing this , okay ?
you lost your jobs .
you lost your homes , your pride .
my wife left me .
i was just a name on a spreadsheet to this bank .
so you looked up your brother &apos;s old partner , ricky dunn ,
&apos;cause you knew john wouldn &apos;t help you .
shut up !
and you borrowed his van .
but john discovered what you did , so you shot him .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
he was my brother .
and he wouldn &apos;t have talked .
so it was carl .
he was gonna turn us in .
this was your idea .
you &apos;re the one who got me into this .
i think you got yourself into this .
yeah , well , we &apos;re gonna get out .
the only thing that is protecting you two right now
is me .
i &apos;m standing between you and a sniper &apos;s bullet .
i &apos;m your only chance . come on .
you guys still got something to live for .
no , i don &apos;t . not anymore .
yes , you do .
think of phoebe .
all right ? and timmy .
come on , come on .
they ...
they don &apos;t want to see you die .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you &apos;ve done .
come on , give me the gun .
come on .
come on , david .
give me the gun .
come on .
come on .
no !
get on the floor !
stay put . don &apos;t move .
i swear to god , tommy .
if you were involved in this ,
i was gonna kill you myself .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s all we need --
another rizzoli charged with murder .
thank you so much , jane .
you &apos;re welcome .
next time you need help moving , just call me , okay ?
all charges have been dropped .
i spoke with your parole officer .
he &apos;s waiving your violations .
thank you .
thank you .
come on .
we &apos;ll drive you home .
ma , stop .
you gonna put the job ahead of her ?
she did .
i heard that you wouldn &apos;t put the toilet seat down .
she told you that ?
yeah .
she said that was the only thing she didn &apos;t like about you .
i &apos;m having grilled cheese .
oh , it goes with anything . it &apos;s a 1994 chateau de gordes .
again ? i &apos;m so sick of that .
it &apos;s sheer perfection .
i &apos;ve only had it once .
listen , i don &apos;t want
to stand in the way of a great romance , okay ?
what do you mean ?
you and tommy .
i mean , clearly , opposites attract .
it &apos;s an evolutionary strategy
to ensure healthy reproduction .
okay . why do you got to go straight to breeding ?
all right ? with my brother ?
look , i like tommy .
a lot .
but i love you .
and i hate it when you hate me .
so i don &apos;t want to do anything
to compromise our friendship .
good , &apos; cause i hate it when i have to hate you .
sip it slowly .
how much was this ?
$ 625 .
did you just spit out a &apos; 94 chateau --
de blah @-@ blah ? yes .
my god , some smart shopper tommy is .
he wasted a month &apos;s rent
on a bottle of rancid vinegar and old garlic .
no , no .
it just needs to breathe
and release its tannins .
really ?
ew . you might be right .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna pour it back in the bottle
so tommy can take it back .
they &apos;re not gonna take it back .
