that show of force ,
was that all about humiliating dad ?
your honour , the police pulled over some kid
and found a baggie with cocaine residue .
they also found a gun loaded
with hollow @-@ point bullets on the floor .
in order to beat the rap ,
this 16 @-@ year @-@ old punk claims
he saw my client drop that weapon .
and mind you , not yesterday ,
but over two years ago ,
using it in the meantime
to shoot at cans and impress his friends .
i gotta tell you , phil , you look fantastic .
as in science fiction ?

tone , with these hassles , you should make it up our way here .
you know , maybe that &apos;s not such a bad idea .
mr federal attorney .
what can i do for you ?
you had to have your cheap headline .
are you not aware we &apos;ve been building a rlco case
against tony soprano for five fucking years ?
then you blow this popcorn fart .
are you gonna relax ?
it &apos;s just all this little stuff ,
like my phone has one little bar up here .
what if the broker calls ?
caravan for my house is on tuesday , and the gas is still off .
mine works .
hello .
essex county dropped the charges .
i told you it was a piece @-@ of @-@ shit case .
two years old , no decent prints .
santa claus could have dropped that gun in the snow .
they dropped the charges . well , i &apos;d say i owe you one ,
but i &apos;m sure it &apos;s more than one .
neil , thanks again .
thank god . i didn &apos;t want it hanging over your birthday .
can we forget already that it &apos;s my birthday ?
you say that and then you get upset if nobody makes a fuss .
there you are .
i was starting to get worried .
traffic was horrible .
i &apos;ve had to pee since glens falls .
well , go .
hey , sis .
national lampoon &apos;s vacation .
i gotta admit it ,
every time , once you &apos;re up here ,
it &apos;s pretty great .

he has enough lawn maintenance
since somebody let the gardener go .
the house wasn &apos;t enough ?
i &apos;m joking .
you know how grateful we are .
beer , tone ?
absolutely .
800 rounds per .
he chromed out the inner carrier .
it &apos;s got the panther fluted barrel .
is this how you bagged that deer ?
i wouldn &apos;t use this on a deer .
it &apos;s unsportsmanlike .
like the poor prick &apos;s got a chance against a 30 @-@ 06 .
last two seasons ,
i &apos;ve been using a bow and arrow exclusively .
get the fuck out of here .
it levels the playing field .
the ar @-@ 1.0 , that &apos;s my birthday present to you .
thanks , bobby .
don &apos;t say shit to carmela .
we almost got a summer place .
down the shore , remember , tony ?
any more stuffed mushrooms ?
my pop bought this place cos it was close to canada .
he had ties in montreal . you know , tone .
his father , my grandpop ,
come into the country through montreal , illegally .
he wasn &apos;t ellis lsland , your grandfather ?
nah , got mixed up in some shenanigans on the other side ,
anti @-@ government or something .
had a police record .
they oughta build a wall now , though .
i &apos;m telling you . -amen .
when are the kids back ?
sophia the 7th and robert the end of the month .
that &apos;s nice .
i &apos;m very lucky to be back
with my family after all these years .
look at you and me , tony .
who would have thought we &apos;d have this kind of relationship ?
the credit goes to you .
you really changed .
so i had to change ?
it &apos;s a compliment .
you were fine .
you &apos;re different since
that stuff last year ,
the shooting .
i &apos;m sure carm would agree .
i would .
look , the fish are jumping .
i &apos;m different how ? how am i different ?
story you heard .
the pool .
oh , my god , please .
what ?
you don &apos;t wanna know .
pradeep , our pharmacist ,
was at a pool party .
all the kids were playing in the water .
the adults were all around , having drinks , barbecuing .
somehow even with all these people around ,
this three @-@ year @-@ old child managed to fall into the pool .
nobody even noticed till they found him
floating face down in the water .
brain @-@ dead .
poor kid &apos;s in one of those padded wheelchairs now .
i can &apos;t get that story out of my mind .
i don &apos;t know why .
happy birthday .
it &apos;s supposed to rain ,
so make sure that all the cellar windows are closed .
ok .
check the one by dad &apos;s wine rack .
ok .
easy , big fella .
that jacuzzi &apos;s bitchin &apos; .
who &apos;s that ?
fran the waitress . we &apos;re really busy down here .
you &apos;re at work ?
yes , i &apos;m at the pizzeria .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
bye .
the jacuzzi and the tub &apos;s fantastic .
there &apos;s everybody .
don &apos;t let us forget to wash the sheets , ok ?
tony seem to hit the hooch a little at lunch today ?
i think he &apos;s feeling his age .
what do you think it &apos;s like for me ?
when we were kids ,
he &apos;d do whatever i said .
he ate one of tippy &apos;s milk bones because i told him it was a cookie .
my therapist sandy ,
she said my ma was a splitter .
she &apos;d pit us three against each other ,
to toughen us up , i guess .
i couldn &apos;t help hearing you with aj .
god , you gotta walk on eggshells with these kids today , huh ?
we &apos;re almost through that phase , thank god .
you &apos;re good with them .
really ? i wish he &apos;d go back to college .
he sleeps most nights at blanca &apos;s .
speaking of kids and ma ,
sandy said something interesting ,
that when we were babies ,
everything was fine ,
but ma couldn &apos;t stand that as her babies got older , they separated from her .
when they started to talk and express ideas ,
that &apos;s when the trouble started .
it wasn &apos;t that she didn &apos;t love us .
you &apos;ve been a solid performer for some time now .
plus , you &apos;re my brother @-@ in @-@ law .
you get older , you think about things .
you &apos;re a young man . we both are .
world &apos;s still in front of us .
bulls . my estimate historically ,
80 % of the time it ends up in the can like johnny sack
or on the embalming table at cozarelli &apos;s .
don &apos;t even say it .
no risk , no reward .
i mean , yeah , our line of work , it &apos;s always out there .
you probably don &apos;t hear it when it happens ?
ask your friend in there on the wall .
listen to us . morbid fucks .
come to think of it , you never popped your cherry in that regard , right ?
no .
yet your old man was the fucking terminator .
i come close .
i done other shit , but no .
it &apos;s a big fat pain in the balls .
especially now with dna evidence .
my pop never wanted it for me .
he said there were times with the worry
that he wished he could have stayed in the shop ,
just cut hair .
to be honest , i &apos;d rather he fucking shot me than cut my hair .
there &apos;s somebody i &apos;ve been bringing along to insulate myself
from the stuff that could bring down a boss ,
and take care of carmela too , in case ...
god forbid .
now , maybe
between me and this person
there &apos;s diverging agendas .
sorry to hear it .
it happens .
thing is , the newark facilities manager ,
he &apos;s gonna fix it so we do all the
window replacements in the projects .
i was thinking maybe you should work that .
i &apos;m honoured to be considered .
then we &apos;ll see what happens after that , long term .
time for presents .
and grappa ?
i told you i didn &apos;t want presents , just ...
just a few kind words .
that was my father &apos;s line every year .
i get the joke , believe me .
soprano home movies .
i had the super 8s from when we were kids transferred .
oh , cool .
it &apos;s really very thoughtful .
thank you .
look at these . -look at this .

what are you doing ? it goes in the bank .
we play the free parking rule .
what ?
money from community chest and chance goes in the middle .
whoever lands on free parking gets it .
you show me that in the rules .
it isn &apos;t in the rules but a lot of people do it .
it adds a new level of excitement .
i don &apos;t agree with that .
when we were growing up this is how we played .
the parker brothers took time to think this all out .
i think we should respect that .
fuck the parker brothers . just play the game .
out of grappa . how about some rémy ?
9 , 1.0 , 1.1 ... -yay !

how about the time that mom and dad were coming back from the copa ?
that &apos;s enough , janice .
and ma &apos;s hair ...
that never even happened . and anyway , it &apos;s not for public consumption .
oh , my god , what ?
they &apos;re driving back from manhattan
with uncle junior and his goomah .

rosemary . and ... anyway ,
my father &apos;s driving and
she &apos;s ragging on his ass . you know how she &apos;d get .
he &apos;d been drinking , i guess .
and he takes out his gun .
oh , my god .

i can &apos;t believe you never told me that story .
yeah , what &apos;s the big deal ?

you beat me fair and square .
come on , let &apos;s just ...
well , i hope you &apos;re proud of yourself .
how &apos;s your shoulder ?
great .
we should have it looked at .
i &apos;m packed . i would like to go .
you were right . you told me to ease up on the drinking .
you should have insisted .
so now it &apos;s my fault ?
go wash your face so we can leave .
i hope you &apos;re hungry . i made a frittata .
and ramos fizzes .
well , thank you , but we think it &apos;d be better if we left .
not because of last night ?
it &apos;s for the best .
come on , we &apos;re family .
jesus , these things happen .
i think we &apos;d all be more comfortable .
we had a little too much to drink , .
but no harm done . the whole thing &apos;s already forgotten .
besides , tone , we have that thing later . the canucks .
it &apos;s a sin to waste food .
well , i don &apos;t know .
here . hair of the dog .
a suicide car bomber
kills two us soldiers west of baghdad .

i &apos;ve seen that sitting in the chair thing .

that couple from verona never came back to take a second look at the house .
that couple from verona never came back to take a second look at the house .
meadow &apos;s staying in this weekend to study .
paediatricians aren &apos;t the highest @-@ paid doctors .
that &apos;s radiologists .
but still , what a wonderful thing to be .
if that fucking throw rug hadn &apos;t been there ,
it would have been bobby on his back , not me .
what ?
i would have kicked his ass .
jesus christ , do you think i care ?
you don &apos;t , huh ?
you were there ,
that night in the crowd in the parking lot at pizza world ,
when i took dominic tedesco .
i didn &apos;t know your name
but i remember our eyes met , and you were blown away .
i was in fucking high school .
i should be turned on by you beating up your brother @-@ in @-@ law
at your 47th birthday ?
how old is bobby ? 42 , 43 ?
those four years don &apos;t make a difference ?
you had it coming .
you get away with murder because you &apos;re his boss .
really ?
how about the fact he wouldn &apos;t live in that mansion
if it wasn &apos;t for me ?
i had to sacrifice my entire friendship with johnny sack
to get him and janice that house .
funny how everybody forgets that .
they are grateful , tony . jesus !
you and your sister are emotionally blocked .
i &apos;m old , carm .
and my body has suffered a trauma
that it will probably never fully recover from ,
so why don &apos;t we just face the facts ?
yeah ?
hey , t , it &apos;s me .
just wanted to wish you a belated happy birthday .
we had a scare last summer .
guy down the road was fishing , thought he caught a snakehead .
thankfully it was only a bowfin .
what &apos;s a snakehead ?
this ugly fish ...
tell you something , bobby .
we had this little tussle a year ago
before my injury ...
this again ?
tone , i think everyone here knows
you were at a disadvantage .
i don &apos;t want to take nothing away from you ,
but ...
a sucker punch is a sucker punch .
so it wasn &apos;t fair and square ?
make up your mind .
i think we both know what &apos;s what .
but forget about it . i have .
come on , bobby , let &apos;s go .
where are you two going ?
play some golf with some people .
right .
why don &apos;t you hit a few into the lake ?
bobby , come on .
you ok ?
could turn the air on .
i &apos;m good .
just i should have taken a leak before we left .
honey , look at you go !
mercedes , you didn &apos;t say you were taking her in the lake .
i &apos;m watching her .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me when you
take her in the lake .
i &apos;m here too .
i don &apos;t want nica going in
the lake without my knowing .
come on , you &apos;ve been in there long enough .
did you hear me ? i &apos;m talking to you .
no !
what did you say ?
nica , come over here .
no .
don &apos;t tell me no .
don &apos;t you ever tell me no .
mad .
you &apos;re not mad .
you have no right to feel mad .
i &apos;ll give you something to be mad about .
take her to the house
and put her to bed now .
she &apos;s never spoken to me like that .
probably needs that nap .
that fucking bobby jr ,
he &apos;s going through his adolescence .
he &apos;s nothing but lip and attitude .
she &apos;s imitating .
she &apos;s got that pitch @-@ perfect ear .
i &apos;m a little hyper today .
maybe it &apos;s these oestrogen pills .
if you &apos;re as hung over as i am ...
that was some story you told , though .
my dad and the gun ?
that alone was worth the price of admission .
he was nabolidan &apos; to his core , boy .
i had this boyfriend once ...
one night he hit me .
boy , oh , boy , i blew my lid .
i completely exploded .
i &apos;m more like my dad .
than who ?
tony , for example .
so what are you saying ? he &apos;s more like your mother ?
no . listen ,
he &apos;s got that temper too .
in the end he went his separate way .
who ?
my boyfriend .
i &apos;m not proud of it , though .
sounds like he deserved it .
my mother , though ,
she could lay out in the weeds for days , years ,
waiting to strike .
when you got something in that head
of yours , you give yourself away .
what are you saying about my husband ?
what did i say ?
i don &apos;t know what goes on in your house ,
but for your information , tony has never raised his hand to his children .
nothing goes on in my house .
or to me .
fine .
you know what , i take that back .
once he slapped aj
and he felt horrible about it for days .
bobby took advantage of him last night when tony had
had too much to drink .
there is no excuse for the way bobby blindsided him .
tony is not a vindictive man .
what did i say ?
you had a pretty good success with the lipitor , right ?
well , at this moment we could also sell to you fosamax .
medication
for ostéoporose , you know , for the women , their bones .
now , one month &apos;s supply of fosamax ,
four pilules ... pills ,
sells for $ 70 us from the pharmacy .
we sell four pills to you for $ 10 us .
are they counterfeit ?
no .
they &apos;re true . they &apos;re from assurance maladie ,
but expirées , like , old .
change the date , nobody knows .
how much fosamax can you get ?
20,000 pills every three months .
could we get you to lower your price ?
you already make a big profit .
that &apos;s a good deal .
we &apos;ll give you the first pills in one week , monday .
what ?
i cannot come the week next
because my sister ,
she has problems in the court .
she got a good lawyer ?
makes all the difference .
her old husband , he wants to take their child to winnipeg
because he &apos;s some drummer over there .
can you believe this ? she never see her son .
separate a child from his mother ?
i mean , what kind of person does this ?
i would give anything to be , you know , débarrass ? of this shit .
to have him gone from her life .
that &apos;s tough talk , bon ami .
i &apos;m really serious .
i tell you what ,
you knock your price down to 35 grande
and we &apos;ll see what we can do about making your sister &apos;s problem
go away .
and i &apos;m not talking about a lawyer .
now , who does this ?
you pay to some drug addict ?
no , somebody reliable .
we got to talk .
you &apos;ll take care of this , right ?
sure .
no bow and arrows , now .
nice , huh ?
how was the game ?
you know , he held his own , but ...
must have been the new clubs .
do you want to eat something ?
no , i figure we should hit the road ,
beat the traffic .
ok .
you let him win . smart .
drive carefully .
here . thanks again for my present .
wait till you see the shots of aunt gemma from the &apos; 60s .
you forget what a beauty she was before the steroids .
bobby , you &apos;re a wonderful host .
our pleasure .
when nica wakes up from her nap , give her a belly smooch from us .
ok . bye .
he broke your balls about the fight , didn &apos;t he ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
bobby ? where are you going ?
it &apos;s business , jan.
now ?
yeah .
when are you coming back ?
i &apos;m not sure . a couple of days .
the salernos are coming tomorrow .
stop fucking nagging me .
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
yeah ?
some news about this gun charge .
it &apos;s not going away .
you said they dropped it .
essex county did , but now looks like the feds took it over .
fuck .
what happened to &quot; it &apos;s a piece @-@ of @-@ shit case &quot; ?
it is . unwinnable .
but fold it into a rlco , it adds a predicate .
good news is if they had what they needed
we &apos;d be having this conversation through glass .
i gotta go .
bobby , finally ! hey , bobby .
