you put the giblets in a pan ?
yes , chef .
thanks , a boy named sous ... chef .
i don &apos;t get it , but i trust you .
all right , philip ,
tuck the wing tips under the body of the bird
and place in a roasting pan .
as you wish , my crumpet .
i am cooking thanksgiving dinner this year .
huge step for claire to trust me with this .
but i have help -- this new app .
it &apos;s , uh , international super chef nigella lawson .
i can even program my name ,
so it &apos;s like she &apos;s right here
guiding my every move with that sultry british voice .
i listened to her meringue instructions
in the car last week .
there was so much
whipping and beating i had to pull over .
how &apos;s it going in here ?
great .
you just take advantage of your first thanksgiving
not sweating over a hot stove
and having to sit down to dinner
all gross and grumpy and exhausted .
yeah , this year , you can finally be in a good mood .
well , i was until this little riff .
mom and jay sent a thanksgiving greeting from mexico .
i didn &apos;t even know mexico had thanksgiving .
i know . i said the same thing .
god , we &apos;re really gonna miss alex .
i still don &apos;t get why you passed up a free trip .
because they &apos;re meeting 23 colombians
who call my mom &quot; la tranquila &quot; -- the quiet one .
hola , familia !
happy thanksgiving !
happy birthday tomorrow , luke !
yeah , luke , we didn &apos;t forget about you .
we got you a great present here in mexico .
see you when we get back .
bye ! bye @-@ bye !
see you soon !
and cut .
well , i think we sold that .
the colombians &apos; trip got canceled
because a mudslide took out the runway at the local airport .
that thing &apos;s made of dirt .
are we sure it didn &apos;t just rain ?
so we never left ,
and we could have gone to phil and claire &apos;s , but ...
we decided to enjoy our own quiet ,
stress @-@ free holiday dinner at home with no one the wiser .
we &apos;re having a little steak @-@ cation ,
only with turkey instead of the steak .
stay @-@ cation .
what did i say ?
&quot; steak @-@ cation . &quot;
it &apos;s stay @-@ cation .
oh , so , this is how you want to start
the quiet , stress @-@ free dinner , with an english lesson ?
they call her &quot; la tranquila . &quot;
we really need to remember to return this backpack to lily .
oh , and , honey ,
don &apos;t forget mitchell hates raisins .
so when you &apos;re making the stuffing , you can &apos;t put any --
i know how hard it is for you to hand over the reins ,
but you have got to trust me .
i do trust you .
it &apos;s just easy to forget the little things .
i &apos;m not going to forget anything .
now go .
you two need to run to the grocery store .
i forgot green beans , yams , and cranberry sauce .
what &apos;s in the crib ?
what crib ? you &apos;re a crib .
shouldn &apos;t you be studying ?
well , i &apos;m done with my midterms .
i finished my college essay .
and i was just about to go on a bike ride .
why are you acting so guilty ?
you &apos;re guilty .
how did i ever get to be a champion debater ?
it is a backup turkey .
i bought it in case your father &apos;s doesn &apos;t work out ,
which i hope it does .
but if it doesn &apos;t ,
this could save him a lot of embarrassment .
please don &apos;t tell him .
he would die if he thought i didn &apos;t trust him .
interesting .
i mean , i &apos;m going off to college soon .
all of a sudden ,
you &apos;re keeping something warm in my old crib .
here you go , sweetie . you &apos;ll like this better .
oh , my gosh . you got to be kidding me .
not this again .
what ? she said her eggs were watery ,
so i made her a waffle .
please don &apos;t make a thing out of it .
i &apos;ve seen you send food back .
remember that time in miami ?
okay , first of all , this isn &apos;t a restaurant .
secondly , my bisque had a tooth in it .
it was a shell .
there was a filling in it .
ugh , i don &apos;t feel like waffles .
can you make me cereal ?
sure .
absolutely not .
absolutely not , lily .
you are gonna finish that waffle ,
or you &apos;re not gonna have breakfast .
can i at least eat it in front of the tv ?
yes .
no .
thanks , daddy .
mean daddy .
okay , okay .
you give in to her every whim , and i &apos;m mean daddy .
that &apos;s not true .
isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s this ?
this is how she sees us .
i &apos;m a screaming demon ,
and you &apos;re just a @-@ smilin &apos; and a @-@ bakin &apos; .
and , incidentally ,
do we really think this is refrigerator @-@ worthy ?
she put it up yesterday after you made her clean her room .
and after you made her brownies .
she is gonna turn into a willful , fat little girl
unless you start getting tough with her ,
because right now you &apos;re her pal ,
and i &apos;m just the pitchfork @-@ wielding she @-@ devil .
it lined up , didn &apos;t it ?
yeah , we really got lucky with you holding that fork .
long story short .
if you pour it , it &apos;s cranberry sauce .
but i &apos;m sorry , if you slice it ,
it &apos;s cranberry jelly .
i &apos;m literally driving as fast as this car can go .
is that a sock in your sleeve ?
i did laundry at your house this morning ,
and you have no dryer sheets .
i like staying with you ,
but it &apos;s basically camping .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry !
i didn &apos;t feel anything .
i mean , of -- of course i felt something ,
and you do have them -- i mean --
why didn &apos;t you honk ? !
wouldn &apos;t that have just made it worse ?
now , philip ,
rub the breasts and thighs with olive oil .
i &apos;m a little new at this , but okay .
before stuffing the bird ,
you may want to remove your jewelry .
you mean take off my wedding ring ?
you bad , bad girl .
who are you talking to ?
i was -- nothing . who ?
i &apos;m not gonna throw away 20 years of --
is the salad burning ?
here &apos;s everything ,
including your cranberry so @-@ called sauce .
that was fast .
i was driving 70 miles an hour .
now , philip , cover the breast and legs
with a buttered cheesecloth .
that thing &apos;s a little creepy .
you &apos;re a little creepy .
i don &apos;t love being the person
who hides in her garage with her secret crib turkey ,
but it &apos;s not always fun being the backstop .
you &apos;re telling me .
until you get home from work every day ,
my main job is keeping luke alive .
i actually caught him on the treadmill with scissors .
do you ever feel jealous of them ?
you do , too ?
oh , yeah , all the time .
please , while you and i are busy being responsible ,
thing one and thing two are off having so much fun .
ple-- &quot; billion @-@ dollar ideas &quot; ?
the real head scratcher &quot; t.m. &quot;
now , that -- that is a classic .
look at this .
isn &apos;t that the old t @-@ shirt cannon that dad modified for luke
to take on his paper route ?
yeah , it &apos;s a fun idea , huh ?
you know , there &apos;s no reason you and i can &apos;t relax a little
and have as much fun as they do .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s be more like those idiots .
yeah . con @-@ garage @-@ ulations .
nailed it .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
um , n @-@ nothing . nothing .
we -- it &apos;s not what it looks like .
really ?
no .
&apos;cause what it looks like
is me taking over the cooking duties
has allowed my girls here
to let down their hair and have fun for a change .
looks like you even dug out the old news @-@ zooka .
oh , no !
oh , my god ! again ? !
i @-@ it was an accident !
once is an accident , perv .
honey , come on . it &apos;s time to go .
i &apos;m ready .
oh , no , sweetie ,
we bought you that pretty new thanksgiving dress .
but i want to wear this .
she wants to wear that , cameron .
thoughts ?
well , lily , uh , we &apos;re all dressed up .
you don &apos;t want to be disrespectful , do you ?
i should be able to wear what i want .
okay , well , sweetie , listen ,
i &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t leave until you put that dress on .
okay .
you see ?
as much as you want me to yell ,
i have a more effective method .
when you say to a child ,
&quot; i will treat you with dignity and respect , &quot;
that child will , in turn , say to you --
i left the tag on . this is going back monday .
oh , and right in the middle of getting up
on such a high , high horse .
okay , lily .
you said put it on .
well , it &apos;s on . let &apos;s go .
we cannot let her run the show like this .
okay , trust me , i have another plan .
really ? because right now ,
our child &apos;s walking around like a vietnamese annie hall .
mitchell , i will make it clear that she is not the boss .
okay , well , no , no , we can &apos;t go out now .
okay , where did she learn that annoying habit ?
claire &apos;s been picking her up from meditation mondays .
the little bird &apos;s coming along nicely .
hey , this could be our new thanksgiving tradition .
what , hiding from our own family ?
hey , if the indians hid a little bit more ,
they might still have this country .
no , just taking a break from each other .
god knows i couldn &apos;t love them more ,
but the kennedys didn &apos;t get together as much as this family .
so you don &apos;t feel guilty ?
for what ?
not sharing this 30 @-@ year @-@ old scotch with phil ?
he mixes it with 7up , gloria .
it &apos;s a hate crime .
let &apos;s hope the power isn &apos;t out here , too .
it looks fine . the porch light &apos;s on .
turkey coming through !
they moved the damn dinner here .
thank you for cracking the code .
pop the turkey in the oven , luke .
lost a little cooking time , but if we crank it to 550,
dinner should be on the table as scheduled .
yes , chef .
so , how &apos;s it going in here ?
minor little speed bump , but we &apos;re back on track .
you just relax .
honey , i trust you completely .
you &apos;ve got your sweaty little helper ,
and mama has hers .
thanks .
so , how long until you sneak home
and get the backup turkey ?
have a little faith .
you &apos;re really trusting dad to do this ?
in me .
it &apos;s in lily &apos;s backpack in the trunk of the car .
this is crazy .
let &apos;s just go downstairs and tell them that we &apos;re here .
are you kidding ?
we sent them a video from mexico .
we lied to their faces .
you think we can just go downstairs
and throw money at this and make it go away ?
i &apos;m asking you . do you think that would work ?
i left my purse down there , and manny knows
that i would never leave town without it .
my wallet and keys are on the bar .
and the cigar i was just smoking .
oh , maybe you &apos;re right .
come on , everybody ! outside for picture time !
i knew in my heart you couldn &apos;t be right .
i &apos;m gonna grab a scotch .
anyone know where jay keeps the 7up ?
okay .
phil , stay calm .
yes , the trip over here killed the casserole .
the biscuits are hard .
the gravy has a skin on it like a sharecropper &apos;s neck .
are your onions in hot water , philip ?
yes , i would say they are !
chef , she &apos;s just trying to help .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s not over .
we can still put a very nice meal ...
i left the centerpiece in the trunk .
it &apos;s gonna get all wilted .
where you going ?
everything okay in there ?
peachy .
i left the centerpiece in the trunk .
where are you going ?
i was gonna go get some ice .
well , that &apos;s okay . i can go get it for you .
great . i can get your centerpiece .
i &apos;ll leave your ice right there on that table .
which is where i will leave your centerpiece .
okay , then .
oh , no , no , no , no , no !
so , i want to apologize for flipping out before .
of course you &apos;re not a perv .
come here .
no , it &apos;s okay .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
come here .
it &apos;s okay .
what is that ?
oh , nothing .
no .
for a second , it looked like ...
oh , my god !
you have my underwear ? !
no . okay , well , yes ,
but it &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
uh , they were in my pants .
what is wrong with you ? !
i know you have a crush on me ,
but this is , like , deep freak !
no , i used to have a crush on you ,
but not anymore .
this is all just bad luck .
just take your panties and go .
re @-@ creating the quaint part of the pilgrim story
where they trade underwear for corn ?
oh , my god .
this is not that terrible .
true . we have drinks .
joe &apos;s playing with his &quot; h. &quot;
everybody &apos;s happy .
sí .
and why are we going into my dad &apos;s bedroom ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
lily thinks she can wear whatever she wants ,
so what if we --
no , no , i am not putting on
one of my dad &apos;s hideous leisure suits .
that is not the plan . relax .
do you remember last year when we picked her up
from that family dinner at claire &apos;s ?
we were dressed as cagney and lacey
for pepper &apos;s &apos; 80s ladies party , and she flipped out .
you &apos;re not putting on one of gloria &apos;s dresses .
if you would simply just let me finish ,
that is not the plan .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re both putting on dresses .
no , i am not doing this .
mitchell , it won &apos;t have any impact if i do it by myself .
i promise if it doesn &apos;t work , we &apos;ll do it your way .
you know , the only part of this i like
is getting to see this closet .
mitchell , focus on the goal .
you know she only dresses the way
she does to get attention .
maybe it was cute a few years ago ,
but she &apos;s just getting too old for this .
you know what she needs is a good spank on the bottom .
no , that &apos;s your father &apos;s way .
you told them about that ?
i &apos;m telling you , if i had this closet ,
i never would have come out .
well , you can come back later .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
if those mean girls have something to say to me ,
they should say it to my face .
one problem at a time .
you heard them . they &apos;re coming back .
we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
and go where ?
we &apos;ll sneak down the back stairs .
we &apos;ll run around to the front porch
and pretend we cut our trip short to be with everybody .
now , you grab your coat , get the diaper bag .
i &apos;ll grab a couple of suitcases , and i &apos;ll meet you there .
hey , sweetie , what are you reading ?
what are you wearing ?
well , i think it &apos;s dolce &amp; gabbana .
she asked &quot; what , &quot; not &quot; who . &quot;
do you see red carpet ?
oh , well , we &apos;re just wearing dresses
over our boy clothes , like you .
oh , no , i forgot .
us wearing dresses upsets you , doesn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it does .
i don &apos;t want to make her uncomfortable ,
but we should be able to wear whatever we want .
what to do , what to do ?
i just can &apos;t believe i slipped into one of gloria &apos;s dresses .
relax . it &apos;s a maternity poncho .
okay , we tell them we took the noon flight out ,
and , uh -- where &apos;s joe ?
i thought you were bringing him !
i &apos;m lugging two suitcases .
empty suitcases !
how are we gonna walk in there without ... ?
the little turkey !
i don &apos;t like you calling him that .
no , no , the little turkey i was cooking for us .
it &apos;s still in the oven .
okay .
i &apos;ll say i have to put joe down for a nap ,
and you get rid of the turkey .
i &apos;m just saying you get very mad because i forgot joe ,
but when it comes to turkey --
i don &apos;t have time for thess .
no , if it really bothers lily ,
then we should change , cam ,
and then maybe lily will also consider --
hola , family !
we came back early because we miss you .
we saw the cars .
what , did you move the party here ?
yes ! hello !
so , hey , d @-@ dad , listen ,
the reason that we &apos;re wearing these dresses ...
do what you got to do .
i got to get this little guy up to bed
because that plane ride really knocked him out .
oh , my god !
he &apos;s fine . see ? not crying .
that &apos;s not necessarily a good thing .
and i &apos;m gonna take the luggage to the laundry
because mexico is very dirty .
dad and gloria seem really okay
with us wearing dresses .
yeah , like we do it every day ?
well , if it &apos;s okay with grandpa , it &apos;s okay with me .
the cranberry sauce is okay ,
and the gravy is out of the woods .
and , thanks to you ,
those baby carrots are gonna pull through .
well , they &apos;re fighters .
and now , phillip , for the last time ,
lightly brush the thighs .
i &apos;m gonna miss this randy little redcoat .
but it &apos;s time to cross the finish line .
no !
what ? !
cranking up the heat must have dried it up and shrunk it !
it &apos;s tiny !
how am i supposed to feed 11 people with this pigeon ? !
hey , dad , how &apos;s it coming ?
great !
just some last @-@ minute touches , and we &apos;re good to go .
great .
panic in turkey town .
the backup turkey &apos;s in lily &apos;s book bag .
bring it to me . i &apos;ll do the rest .
i &apos;ve never felt so alive .
hey , so , i want to try and apologize again .
it &apos;s okay . it was , it was all my fault .
no , no , it was an accident .
we &apos;re good .
thanks .
and just to wrap things up once and for all ,
some things were said in the heat of the moment
that weren &apos;t really meant .
i know you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a perv .
yes , that . that .
and , and also , that thing about
you not having a crush on me anymore .
i @-@ i promise i don &apos;t .
oh , manny , come on .
we &apos;re really trying to wrap things up .
i swear . i barely even look at you anymore .
well , when did that happen ?
was it when i lightened my hair ?
it washes me out , right ?
do other people feel this way ?
haley ,
you are a beautiful woman who will break many hearts
before you &apos;re done , mine among them .
you meant &quot; hug , &quot; didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m , i &apos;m sorry .
we need a smaller platter or something
that makes this look normal @-@ sized !
how do you feel about a coaster ?
fill it in with this sandwich turkey .
it &apos;s past its sell @-@ by date ,
but i always think that &apos;s more of a suggestion , anyway .
i &apos;m gonna get them all loaded up on bread .
and now , philip ,
what to do with all the leftovers .
what happened to the sweet girl i downloaded ?
so , did you have it out with our daughter ?
well , you know , it &apos;s a holiday , and i ...
fine ! i will handle this .
i will be the permanent bad guy in this family
cause you &apos;re so afraid of our daughter not liking you .
but just so you know ,
i had one parent growing up who wanted to be my friend
and another one who didn &apos;t care about that .
guess which one is still in my life .
delicious homemade bread ?
that looks like just regular white bread .
you two seem drunk . this will soak up the booze .
am i ?
oh , alex . wait .
lily .
alex brought your backpack in for you .
so why don &apos;t you go ahead and take it out to our car ?
maybe later .
no , lily !
it &apos;s okay . i will take it now .
alex , put the backpack down !
mom !
lily , you are not in charge of what you wear ,
of breakfast , or anything .
now , put that backpack on and march it out to the car !
it &apos;s too heavy .
well , that &apos;s tough
because i &apos;m not carrying it for you anymore !
i like this new guy , huh ?
see ? i told you it was too heavy .
my gosh , what in the world is in this ? !
no !
claire , why is there a fully cooked turkey
in the backpack we left at your house ?
yes , claire , why is there ?
could it be you made a backup
because you never trusted me with the dinner at all ?
well , i thought there was a chance that --
what , that i &apos;d screw everything up ?
you know what ? i have half a mind
to pack up the beautiful meal i made --
dinner is served !
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t understand .
does everybody get one ?
i was just going to sub in my turkey
if you got in trouble , which , i mean ...
well , now you touched it ,
so you , alex , and haley will share that one .
dark meat for your dark , untrusting soul .
phil !
you know , this was a brand @-@ new backpack ,
and now it &apos;s got turkey juice all up in it !
okay , back it up , old yeller .
okay , could we just stop ?
this is thanksgiving , for god &apos;s sake .
and not to mention that tomorrow is luke &apos;s birthday .
hey , this is the suitcase with my present , right ?
you had it in the video .
no !
what the hell ? !
congratulations , luke !
you &apos;re finally a man !
in my country , when you turn 16,
you get your turkey .
wait , you made the video
before you decided to come back early .
were you gonna keep the turkey in there for four days ?
it &apos;s a tradition .
how did you get that thing through customs ?
it is called customs .
they ... respect customs .
wait a minute .
i know this bird .
i &apos;ve been oiling these breasts all day .
this is my turkey !
done to perfection !
eat it , claire !
wait , so , how did dad &apos;s turkey
get in their suitcase ?
and where did that small turkey come from ?
and how did you know to come here ?
dinner was supposed to be at claire &apos;s .
all right , all right .
it &apos;s like &quot; the caine mutiny &quot; in here !
our vacation got canceled at the last minute .
we decided not to say anything
because we wanted a break .
a br-- a break from what ? !
from thanksgiving craziness .
from -- from stress , from yelling ,
from these two parading around in dresses .
that was a one @-@ time thing .
okay , we don &apos;t wear dresses at home .
now , look , i get that thanksgiving
is a big day for families
who never see each other ,
but this group is together non @-@ stop .
look , why don &apos;t you take the suitcase turkey home with you ?
you take the backpack turkey .
we &apos;ll order a pizza , and we &apos;ll all call it a night .
fine . that sounds great .
all right . okay , fine .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
i know i seem like the last person to say this ,
but we can &apos;t just skip thanksgiving !
time is going by so fast .
it seemed like only yesterday that manny was hot for me ,
and he &apos;s not anymore .
and someday , alex may have a boyfriend
who wants her to spend it with his family .
okay , we probably got a little window there .
but my point is that i love my crazy family ,
and i want to spend this holiday with them .
if you want a break , we can skip christmas .
fine . settled .
okay .
skip christmas .
okay. cool .
i already had plans to spend christmas
in cabo with my friends .
i &apos;ve got to get out of here .
why did we eat all three turkeys ?
i hope that thanksgiving &apos;s on a friday next year ,
so that i can sleep through the entire weekend .
mom , can you take this one ? i &apos;m exhausted .
wow , you really must be .
phil , give it up .
honey , you can dance all you want ,
but you &apos;re not fooling anyone .
continue to whip vigorously , philip ,
until your meringue stiffens .
that &apos;s hilarious . i don &apos;t --
are the cheeks turning nice and pink ?
what &apos;s the problem ?
now plunge into cold water .
i was just about to suggest the same thing .
