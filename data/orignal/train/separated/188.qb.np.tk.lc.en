it was so much easier
when it was just about where we sat on the met steps .
it &apos;s time for a new challenge ,
for both of us .
my father turned his first profit by the time he was 22 .
i hope to do it by the time i &apos;m 21 .
and how can you be so sure ?
because you believe in me .
you were the one that needed to kiss her again
to realize for yourself that your feelings for her are real .
vanessa , i love you .
oh that &apos;s not really the reaction i was hoping for .
it &apos;s not easy being queen .
sounds like kind of a yawn .
yes compared to being an international drug dealer .
a little bit of danger is what makes life worth living .
two years ago at the masquerade ball
i tried to tell you i loved you .
you loved me ?
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
tripp is divorcing maureen .
we &apos;re going away together .
it is a huge mistake .
i love tripp and i &apos;d do anything to make him happy .
where &apos;d you get that ?
the more relevant question is what your stepfather will say
when he finds out that your mother is a cheating whore .
you left her alone in a wrecked car ? !
you stay the hell away from her .
you &apos;re becoming a man in a way that your father never was .
lily ?
charles .
his beloved wife died giving birth to me .
&quot; it was the best of times .
it was the worst of times . &quot;
seems dickens knew something about life on the upper east side
where the only thing you can count on
is that time changes everything .
word has it . s gave up politics
to focus on issues closer to her heart .
i can &apos;t believe nate &apos;s finally coming home tomorrow .
i feel the same way about dorota &apos;s return .
i never should have agreed
to let her spend the holidays with vanya .
did i tell you that he texts me
every night before he goes to sleep ?
it &apos;s so sweet .
sexting is not sweet .
it &apos;s off @-@ limits until you &apos;re in a relationship .
you haven &apos;t even been on a date .
well you &apos;ll be happy to know he asked me to go to a dinner
for the french ambassador tomorrow night .
oh well chastity belts go very well with formal wear .
i &apos;m serious s. i &apos;m all for you trying this thing with nate
but if you want it to become real
then you &apos;re going to have to take it slow .
okay i @-@ i promise i will . i have to go .
damien dalgaard !
oh my gosh !
how are ya ?
good . i thought you were gonna become a belgian prince
or something after boarding school .
my father took the ambassador post .
you look even more fantastic than you did in school .
oh that was not a very good time for me .
that &apos;s not true .
i seem to remember some fun spanish classes .
really ? more like me crying over conjugations
while you got straight a &apos;s and won all the athletic awards .
you had the mr. perfect thing down .
well i &apos;m late to meet a friend .
so uh i &apos;d love to catch up some more .
yeah great . text me your number .
okay .
good to see you .
yeah you too .
hey are you going to the french ambassador dinner tomorrow night ?
i am .
then i &apos;ll see you there .
see you there .
you know how torturous it is
for me to find shiny things that aren &apos;t intended for me .
it &apos;s just a worthless trinket
some woman left by my father &apos;s grave .
and you aren &apos;t even the least bit curious
about someone who wears your father around her neck ?
one of his concubines had his name tattooed on her ass .
i have more important things to do than search
for another member of the female bart bass fan club .
like helping me achieve
the college experience i so greatly deserve ?
i assume you &apos;re referring to my lunch
to discuss parisian hotel possibilities
with henri duris .
who my research also tells me is
the rumored president of table elitaire .
just imagining my life as a member
of the most exclusive secret society makes me tingle .
well while i find that incredibly arousing
you know i can &apos;t promise anything but an introduction .
all i need to know is
that the most persuasive and powerful man i &apos;ve ever met
is on my side .
so how was your mom &apos;s ?
i &apos;m sure your dad called every day .
well he v @-@ chatted for present opening .
you didn &apos;t want to go to telluride with him huh ?
i can &apos;t say i blame you .
those lincoln hawk guys can be kind of annoying .
well he was so excited when it came up .
i couldn &apos;t stand for him to miss out .
hi .
welcome home .
damien hi .
hey .
lily you remember damien right ?
oh yes . yes . hello .
mrs. humphrey how are you ?
and uh this is for you .
thank you . mm .
um thank you lily for helping me unpack
but i think i &apos;m good now .
um jenny ?
um a word please ?
so your father and i haven &apos;t really discussed
you having boys alone in your room .
maybe just keep the door open ?
lily if we wanted to have sex we &apos;d just go to a hotel .
and seriously it &apos;s not like that with us .
oh then what is it like ?
i mean he seems happy to see you .
um i &apos;ll open the door if anything changes .
oh and you wouldn &apos;t happen to know
when your father was coming back 。
larissa accidentally lost the itinerary .
i think he said today
but just call him and ask .
so cookies . let me guess .
i have a puzzle that needs solving .
i know how much you humphreys like games .
it &apos;s my work all right .
do you remember who you sold this one to ?
the picture &apos;s right there-- bart bass .
do you know who he bought it for ?
mr. bass kept the recipients of his purchases private .
but a woman did bring this one
to repair the hinge about a month ago .
the woman--
early 40s , brown hair , brown eyes ?
look i would be very grateful
if you could share any other information you may have .
i &apos;m sorry . client confidentiality .
my father was the original client .
please this is all i have left of him .
elizabeth fisher .
she paid in cash .
but she had it delivered .
thank you .
with enough time
we all find what we &apos;re looking for ...
even if it was there all along .
nate !
what are you doing here ?
hey . oh my gosh .
you weren &apos;t supposed to be here until tomorrow .
i know . my grandfather got sick of watching me text you
so he had the plane bring me home early .
well remind me to send him a gift .
well i should go .
i left the driver downstairs waiting with the bags
so i could surprise you
but tomorrow though right ?
yes our first official date .
i &apos;ve been thinking a @-@ and i really think
that we should try to take this slow .
yeah . yeah i was thinking the same thing .
okay .
and when time slows
and suddenly every moment counts
all you want is for this time to last forever .
hey .
what ? i &apos;m not that late .
oh no . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry man .
i was just hoping you were vanessa .
oh you invited vanessa here too ?
no not exactly . but she does spend a lot of time here .
i take it that means you still haven &apos;t talked to her .
or gotten a text or seen her .
it &apos;s my fault . i moved too fast you know ?
i read like , five self @-@ help blogs
about how to turn friends into lovers .
yes they use that word . i was a little down at my mom &apos;s place .
well hey man i &apos;m sorry .
you know they say that you should take things more slowly
with a friend than you do with someone you just met .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll send you the link . you might want to read it
before you start this thing with serena .
hey .
oh .
looks like my advice went the way of the clog .
what are you talking about ?
the clog ?
an ugly wooden shoe
that tried to make a statement then disappeared--
just like your resolve to take things slow with nate .
i &apos;m just gonna go with it . you know whatever happens happens .
all right , we all knowing serena what &apos;ll probably happen is
she &apos;ll get swept up in the romance of things
and she &apos;s not gonna want to talk about any of that stuff ever .
really .
nah look it &apos;s cool .
i &apos;ve known serena since i was a little kid .
and we &apos;ve already ... you know years ago .
i know . trust me .
now that i &apos;m with chuck i can see that nate and i
were only perfect on paper . but ...
you and nate can finally be more than just an affair to remember .
which is why we didn &apos;t want to wait for it to start .
and why you don &apos;t want to scare him off .
listen the point is i &apos;ve dated serena for over a year .
and if you want to be able to make things work
you &apos;re gonna have to be able to come up for air
which is really not her favorite thing to do .
you are the one thing nate has always wanted
and could never have . it &apos;s like a diet .
after years of starvation
you can &apos;t just let him gorge on sundaes .
he &apos;ll panic and decide he hates ice cream .
except i &apos;m not ice cream
and nate and i don &apos;t need to play games .
everyone needs to play games .
look you &apos;ve already failed to come out of the gate
with any restraint or control . now all you can do is
introduce some competition make him work for it .
blair that &apos;s the worst advice i &apos;ve ever heard .
mm @-@ hmm . just wait till he starts passing on dessert .
so the ambassador &apos;s daughter &apos;s gonna be at this dinner ?
yeah but her father &apos;s got her under 24 @-@ hour surveillance
which means her guards will be on her at all times .
well i can meet her in the ladies &apos; room .
i bet they don &apos;t follow her in there .
or we could switch handbags .
you--you need to understand . this is a state dinner .
which means there &apos;s security everywhere .
all bags will be searched .
the problem is not getting the package to violette
it &apos;s getting the package in in the first place .
i could wear it .
i can make this . only in mine the paillettes won &apos;t be empty .
you put the pills ...
in the jacket ?
yeah i wear it to the dinner
check it and then violette and i switch coat check tags .
i take her coat ...
and she &apos;ll leave with yours .
it &apos;s not bad .
not bad ?
come on . it &apos;s brilliant !
lily ?
oh hello daniel .
hey . what--what you doing in brooklyn ?
um i was hoping your father would be here .
he was supposed to be back this morning .
i can &apos;t imagine he &apos;d come here before going to see you .
well i just figured
since he hadn &apos;t seen you over the holidays ...
you know how sentimental he is .
yeah . dad ?
well you know what ?
maybe he decided to stay and ski another day .
uh yeah i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what happened .
well i should go . if you see him
tell him i stopped by .
okay .
vronsky where are you ?
anna karenina texted you an hour ago .
she wants to celebrate .
look i &apos;m sorry but anna will have to wait .
i &apos;m about to walk into a meeting .
with monsieur duris ?
are you bringing him here to surprise me ?
as it turns out i wasn &apos;t able to attend the lunch .
are you in the hospital ?
since i know that you &apos;re alive
there could be no other possible reason
you would sacrifice my entire future .
look i &apos;ll get you your introduction okay ?
monsieur duris will be attending
the dinner for the french ambassador tomorrow night .
oh thank god
you practically gave me a heart attack .
why didn &apos;t you mention this earlier ?
i just assumed you &apos;d rather not cross paths with carla bruni .
well in times of crisis ,
sacrifices must be made .
why did you miss lunch ?
i &apos;m trying to meet someone whose schedule is
even more unpredictable than mine .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
i &apos;ve been waiting here for four hours .
has elizabeth fisher still not returned ?
she did return mr. bass .
then why did she not get my message
that i was waiting for her in the bar ?
she did .
she checked out of the hotel immediately afterwards .
whoa ! hey blair .
it &apos;s anna karenina . you never read it . don &apos;t worry about it .
i never do .
come on boy .
rufus .
what are you doing standing out here ?
making a decision .
how are you doing ? did you end up going away ?
i just got back this morning .
and are you back for good ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m deciding .
i came over to talk to lily
but now i &apos;m not sure .
i want to give her a chance to explain .
but still there &apos;s a part of me that doesn &apos;t want to know .
cup of coffee ?
it &apos;s freezing out here .
coffee actually sounds really good .
okay . thank you .
thank you .
hey . i was just about to call you .
well now you don &apos;t have to .
or we don &apos;t have to talk at all .
look i um
i was just thinking that maybe it might make sense
if i go to that dinner tomorrow night alone .
i don &apos;t understand . did i do something wrong ?
no . no not at all . i just ...
you know we said we didn &apos;t want to rush into things .
yeah , but that was before we saw each other .
i know . i know .
but i &apos;m just trying to stick to the plan here .
okay so the plan went from having sex
on eleanor waldorf &apos;s floor to not seeing each other ?
just because we lost track for a minute there
doesn &apos;t mean we should just forget about it .
i mean we already saw each other today .
we can wait a couple more days right ?
you &apos;re right nate .
uh the last thing i would want to do is rush into something .
no . serena , come on .
hello ?
hey damien .
serena .
don &apos;t tell me you need help with your spanish homework .
no , french this time .
please tell me you don &apos;t have a date to the ambassador &apos;s dinner .
are you asking me if i want to go with you ?
of course i do .
great . i &apos;m staying at the waldorfs&apos;
so i &apos;ll text you the address . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
heure hora laat--
no matter what language you say it in
looks like s. just started the clock on a ticking time bomb .
i thought you &apos;d be at school by now .
i thought you lived in the upper east side with your wife .
dan .
lily came by yesterday looking for you .
uh what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
lily and i had a fight . it &apos;s complicated .
israeli @-@ palestinian complicated by the looks of it .
is this--is this why you shipped jenny and me
off to mom &apos;s for christmas ?
this was your mother &apos;s year .
and it wasn &apos;t one of those &quot; parent trap &quot; situations
that you and jenny could swoop in on .
lily and i need time to figure this out .
and um and you &apos;re doing that
by not telling her where you are ?
it &apos;s not the best strategy
but until i actually talk to her
at least i can hold out hope that i &apos;m wrong about what happened .
so you &apos;re not talking to her
because you don &apos;t want to hear what you think she might tell you ?
you know i &apos;m not willing to explain myself , dan .
all right .
fine . fine . you can make your own damn waffles .
come on dan .
listen you &apos;re--you &apos;re the one who &apos;s always saying
to be honest and talk about things
so i really hope you &apos;re not gonna let your marriage die
because you &apos;re scared to take your own advice .
all the girls are gonna want to wear pharmaceuticals .
it &apos;s perfect .
i &apos;m impressed .
thanks . i &apos;m really excited about tonight .
yeah . yeah .
me too .
unfortunately we &apos;re gonna have to do our little dinner some other time .
what ? i ... thought we were doing this together .
it &apos;s my plan .
yeah .
i know . and--and i thank you .
it &apos;s just that uh anyone can check the jacket .
i &apos;m going with someone else--
serena actually .
we &apos;re old friends from boarding school .
serena &apos;s with nate now .
i don &apos;t know about that .
she &apos;s the one who called and asked me so ...
well you know she &apos;s changed since boarding school
and uh there &apos;s--there &apos;s no way she &apos;s gonna go to a state dinner
wearing a jacket filled with pills .
i probably won &apos;t tell her about that then .
well then maybe i will .
see if you were to do that
then i would have to tell her
how you know obviously .
so ...
anyway
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll still get your cut .
伊丽莎白 · 菲舍刚刚入住阿尔贡金旅馆
what &apos;s going on ?
why aren &apos;t you dressed ?
look blair i &apos;m sorry .
but i won &apos;t be able to join you for daer ce soir .
abandoning me in a fur hat is one thing
but you can &apos;t do this . you already missed the lunch .
you know my dreams are dead
without a proper introduction to monsieur duris .
look i left word with his people
that you &apos;d be there okay ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find a way to make an impression .
this is about her , isn &apos;t it ?
the floozy from your father &apos;s grave
you said you had no interest in finding .
it appears i may have spoken too quickly in that regard .
first you lie to me about looking for her ,
and now you &apos;re going to sacrifice
my la table elitaire
to go and look for some random woman
you obviously read the file ,
so you know she &apos;s not random .
she knew my mother &apos;s favorite flowers ,
she had a picture of my father in her jewelry
and she knew me .
and clearly has no interest in being found by you .
you &apos;ve been looking for weeks , and nothing .
one dinner with me won &apos;t make a difference .
i know you may find this hard to comprehend ,
but some things are more important
than your social @-@ climbing agenda .
his name &apos;s damien .
oh , hey , jenny .
he &apos;s the son of the belgian ambassador ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure they hooked up at boarding school .
i &apos;m guessing serena didn &apos;t tell you
she was coming with him , huh ? no . no , she didn &apos;t .
why are you here ?
i figured you &apos;ve come to my rescue enough times .
let me help you for once .
hi . may i take your coat ?
you came with him ? you came with her ?
i think you &apos;re at the wrong place . prom is down the street .
oh , that &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll just let you get back to your euro @-@ fawning .
jenny , um ...
what are you doing here ? just finishing what i started .
serena , i love your jacket . it &apos;s so beautiful .
yeah , actually , let me help you with that .
no , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m gonna keep it on .
it &apos;s so pretty , and it was a gift from you .
so sweet of you . come on .
so much for diplomacy .
let the international games begin .
mesdames et messieurs ,
l &apos;ambassadeur de france et sa fille violette .
serena . and ... not nate .
hi . i &apos;m blair .
damien . a pleasure .
um , the , uh , french ambassador &apos;s daughter &apos;s
an old friend of mine . i &apos;m gonna let you guys ... mm .
excuse me .
i see you took my advice .
it &apos;s good to keep nate on his toes .
and nice choice of competition .
thank you .
your idea &apos;s completely juvenile , but it seems to be working .
i &apos;m jenny . nice to meet you . thank you so much .
i still can &apos;t believe he came with jenny , though .
if i know jenny , she came with him .
but trust me . this is exactly what you wanted .
games will be played , sexual innuendo ensues .
and in the end , nate will be right where you wanted him .
my problems are not nearly so easily resolved .
even monsieur duris &apos; entourage
is perfection in bone structure and styling .
while without a formal introduction ,
i have no choice but to stalk him .
blair , you know you don &apos;t need chuck .
anyone who meets you can see you &apos;re an elitist snob
who &apos;s perfect to run a secret society .
bonne chance .
ah ! merci .
on a un petit soucis , mais je t &apos;assure
j &apos;appellerai le flic
pour cette garce qui le porte .
uh , hi . i &apos;m jenny .
french people really are rude .
she &apos;s usually a much happier customer .
yeah . looks like the plan &apos;s off the rails thanks to serena , huh ?
from what i recall from boarding school ,
it wasn &apos;t terribly difficult to get serena out of her clothes .
that jacket is not leaving this party
on serena van der woodsen .
serena , i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here with that guy .
i mean , if you &apos;re trying to make me jealous ,
there &apos;s no reason to . i want to be here with you . i invited you .
but then you uninvited me .
but you &apos;re right . taking it slow was the right decision .
hi . damien .
nate archibald .
serena , let me introduce you to some people .
thanks for keeping my date company .
so what &apos;s the deal with nate ,
the guy who seemed like he wanted to cut my head off ?
is he an ex @-@ boyfriend or something ?
oh , possibly a new one . honestly , that &apos;s the reason
i asked you to bring me here tonight . i &apos;m sorry .
no , don &apos;t be . the old make @-@ him @-@ jealous-
by @-@ bringing @-@ the @-@ titled @-@ european ploy .
yep .
well , i &apos;m flattered you thought i was worthy of the task .
well , thank you for understanding .
if you really want to make him jealous , though ,
i suggest we commit fully , you know ?
let me take off this jacket .
no , damien . i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i can &apos;t do this .
this was a huge mistake already . i ...
no , no , no . we can make it better .
no strings attached .
damien , i @-@ i don &apos;t like you like that .
i mean it .
hey .
are you serious ? what happened to the serena that i wanted
throughout boarding school ?
i &apos;ve changed , and it &apos;s a good thing .
serena .
i &apos;m sorry . that--that wasn &apos;t ...
monsieur duris ?
c &apos;est vous n &apos;est @-@ ce pas ?
i &apos;m sorry . have we been introduced ?
i &apos;m blair waldorf . perhaps you &apos;ve heard of me ?
i submitted a charter application for n.y.u.
can you just hold on one minute ?
don &apos;t go anywhere . i &apos;ll be right back .
chuck .
there you are .
i knew you &apos;d see the error of your ways .
monsieur duris just stepped out for his cigarette break ,
which gives us two and a half minutes , maybe four ,
if it &apos;s a gauloise .
i came to apologize .
ugh . what happened ?
don &apos;t tell me that awful whore did something terrible to you .
i think that whore may be my mother .
there you are .
serena &apos;s about to leave . you need to stop her .
you know what , jenny ? this just isn &apos;t fun for me anymore .
i should have never listened to dan .
okay , i don &apos;t know what dan said ,
but why would you take romantic advice
from a guy who has a cabbage patch doll ?
i don &apos;t know . all you need to know is i blew my chance .
the masquerade ball was two years ago .
don &apos;t let serena get away again .
you know your mother died during childbirth .
what if she didn &apos;t ?
what if it was just another of my father &apos;s many lies ?
look ,
it makes sense that when you finally let your father go ,
your mother would reappear .
she &apos;s not a ghost , blair .
don &apos;t you think i know how crazy this sounds ?
it &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t tell you or anyone .
i &apos;m aware that one of bart &apos;s old girlfriends
may have known my name ,
and maybe even look like old pictures of my mother .
but my father only had one of these made with an &quot; e &quot; on it .
this woman had it .
whoever she is ,
it just seems like ...
she &apos;ll make losing your mom hurt all over again .
do you really think
anything could be more painful
than killing my own mother
and having my father hate me for it my whole life ?
if there is any chance
this isn &apos;t what happened , i have to know .
i don &apos;t want to keep you
from your business with monsieur duris .
i just had to let you know .
nothing ...
is more important than being with you for this .
sometimes despite the risk ,
the only thing to do is seize the moment ...
or whatever else you can grab .
i really always hope that blair is wrong about these things ,
but if the only reason you want to be with me is
because i &apos;m with someone else , then you can forget it .
no , i want to be here with you .
i just got scared that if we moved too fast
things weren &apos;t gonna work out , and
i really don &apos;t want that to happen .
okay , because i &apos;ve waited ...
i &apos;ve waited a really long time for this .
me , too .
you &apos;ve applied the pressure ?
we need to talk .
rufus , finally .
i @-@ i @-@ i must have called you a hundred times .
i told you i &apos;d call you back when i was ready .
well , i guess i just didn &apos;t expect it to take quite so long .
well , i guess you should have thought about that before you ...
spent the night in a hotel room with your ex @-@ husband .
well , i &apos;m here now .
so why don &apos;t you tell me exactly what happened ?
lil , i &apos;m not interested in any more lies .
we should probably go .
mnh @-@ mnh . let &apos;s finish what we started .
not having any fun ?
no . no , but you go ahead and have yours .
please ... gloat .
you &apos;ve earned it .
well , you &apos;re always telling me that this is a business
and not my social life ,
but yet you &apos;re the one who screwed up a major deal
because you wanted to fulfill
a high school dream of a night with serena van der woodsen .
irony duly noted .
maybe next time you won &apos;t be so quick to dismiss me .
i don &apos;t know if there will be a next time .
word of this botched job will get around to my other clients .
and i owe violette more money
than i could possibly steal back from my father ,
so i think it &apos;s time for me to head back to the continent .
hey , damien .
what is that jacket doing on the floor ?
it belongs to the ambassador &apos;s daughter .
she &apos;ll be furious .
hang it up and make absolutely sure
that violette gets it when she leaves .
looks like you can cancel that transatlantic ticket .
i guess so .
elizabeth ?
i &apos;m sorry . have we met ?
you ran away from me at my father &apos;s grave .
i &apos;m charles bass .
oh , of course .
i apologize for my sudden departure .
it was a very emotional day for me .
you must have known my father very well .
i &apos;m not sure what gives you that impression .
your father and i simply shared
a few memorable months many years ago .
i was actually visiting my mother &apos;s grave ,
and i just stopped to pay my respects .
at that time of the night ?
on the anniversary of my father &apos;s death ?
i saw you had his favorite flowers .
and you knew who i was .
i &apos;m sorry . i ... i read that bart had a son ,
and you look just like your father .
most people say i more closely resemble my mother .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
i never had the pleasure of meeting her .
well , maybe ...
you can tell me why
you had her locket .
your father gave it to me .
the &quot; e &quot; is for &quot; elizabeth . &quot;
i loved to believe it was a special gift .
i &apos;m fairly certain he gave it
to all his girlfriends at the time .
you &apos;re welcome to keep it , if you &apos;d like .
i &apos;m sure it means a great deal more to you than it does to me .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t help you find
whatever it is you &apos;re looking for .
blair , i &apos;m sorry to waste your time .
you should have stayed with monsieur duris .
i wouldn &apos;t want to be anywhere else .
i &apos;m just going to visit the ladies &apos; room .
then we &apos;ll leave .
i &apos;ll bring the car around .
elizabeth .
i already told your friend everything i know .
and he may have bought it .
but i originated that innocent , doe @-@ eyed stare .
i usually employ it when i know more than i &apos;m willing to let on .
chuck ...
spent his entire life
believing that he killed his mother .
if you know anything ...
that could take away even a second of that pain ,
it would be cruel not to share it .
otherwise ,
leaving town means never having to say you &apos;re sorry .
could there be a secret even b. can &apos;t crack ?
only time will tell .
look , i was exhausted .
i was scared . i thought my mother was going to die .
he &apos;s a doctor . he knew people that could help her .
i had to seek him out .
i already knew about cece being sick
and i know that she got better .
and i &apos;m not gonna sit here for another hour
while you talk around this thing .
what do you want me to tell you ?
tell me that you weren &apos;t with him
while i was home taking care of our kids .
tell me that you didn &apos;t sleep with your ex @-@ husband .
i didn &apos;t sleep with him .
i did kiss him ,
but that &apos;s all .
well , it must have been one hell of a kiss
for you to build all these lies around it .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i promise . it d--it didn &apos;t mean anything .
we were engaged .
it means something to me .
where are you going ?
i need time to figure this out ,
away from you .
oh , rufus , please , would you come back home so we can ...
so we can work this out .
hey . hey , vanessa . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s me .
i haven &apos;t heard from you in a while ,
so i &apos;m--i &apos;m guessing that means you don &apos;t want to hear from me .
um , but , uh ,
well , anyway , things around here aren &apos;t--
aren &apos;t so great right now .
you know , with my--my dad and lily ...
so i ... i don &apos;t know .
if you get a minute , i @-@ i could use a friend .
i think we &apos;re pushing our luck at this point .
yeah .
we should go now .
will you grab my jacket and dress , please ?
hey , i don &apos;t see it .
it &apos;s not here .
it &apos;s a perfect fit .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re sticking around for a while .
me , too . here .
no .
this wasn &apos;t a date .
if you want one , you &apos;ll have to ask .
with enough time , eventually we all see
what was right in front of us ...
thank you . don &apos;t mind us .
oh , great service .
hey , that--that girl &apos;s got my coat .
this was probably the best first date ever .
promise me no more slow .
well , what if it &apos;s the good kind of slow ?
and realize no matter how long it took ,
it was worth the wait .
are you all right ?
i spent 18 years
accepting the fact my mother was dead .
i was misguided ... to let one of my father &apos;s girlfriends
allow me to question that ,
to hope things may be different .
your real mother would never turn her back
on a chance to know you .
i don &apos;t have a real mother , blair .
i never will .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re alone .
i love you , chuck ,
and i &apos;ll always be your family .
but for some , that time never comes .
instead of healing old wounds ...
the wait just opens new ones ...
time after time .
