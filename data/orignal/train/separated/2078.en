Kono!
You need to leave. Now.
Adam...
The guys who work for your brother are gonna want payback.
I'm going with you.
Follow your heart.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
Found a stream.
It's packed with trout.
It's a good thing, too, 'cause we're gonna be here a while.
I didn't know you fish.
Yeah, in the... "Man Versus Nature" category of activities,
I'd say fishing ranks as my top two or three.
Oh. You're lucky.
My father never let us fish.
He said it was for peasants.
Huh. Well, then I'm just gonna have to teach you.
Till then...
I catch 'em, you clean 'em.
Deal.
But you're doing the dishes.
Nice try.
Let me get cleaned up.
All right.
Hello?
Kono, it's Chin.
Listen to me very carefully. There's been a security breach.
Your location has been compromised.
By who?
The NLM.
We believe they sold your location to the Yakuza.
You and Adam need to get out of there right now.
Chin...
Just do it, Kono! Go!
Who was that?
We need to leave. Now.
What?
Don't pack, don't take anything, let's just go.
What's going on?
You alright?
Yeah. You?
Yeah. Let's go.
Where are we going?
Hell if I know.
Michael Maki?
Welcome to Oahu, Mr. Smith.
Let me help you with that.
Good flight?
Not bad.
You here for business or pleasure?
Little of both.
Well, let's get you to your hotel,
so you can kick off those boots and hit the beach.
Car's right over here.
Dispatch said you asked for me by name.
Have I met you before?
I don't think I have...
'cause I would remember a guy like you.
Play ball!
Strike!
第六局
Straight down the middle. Here we go.
Batting ninth for the Honolulu Shrimps,
number seven, Grace Williams.
Okay, baby, come on. Only the good ones. Let's go.
Okay, let's go, let's go!
What do you say, number seven?
What do you say, baby? Come on!
Come on, Grace!
Batter up there, baby. Come on.
Here we go, Sam.
Straight down the middle. Here we go.
Strike!
Good cut, baby, good cut. Hey, Grace.
Look at me. Hands up,
elbow up, sit down on that back foot, okay?
Sit down a little bit, all right?
No, no, no.
Grace, Grace, listen to me.
Bring your hands up a couple of inches,
drop your elbow, okay?
All right, here we go, Grace!
Strike two!
Nice!
You, come here, please. Time-out, please.
Grace.
Okay, listen.
Um, we, uh, we love Uncle Steve very much, right?
Okay, good.
But he doesn't know anything about baseball.
So I want you to stop listening to him,
and I want you to listen to me only.
You understand?
You gonna keep talking or we gonna play some ball?
All right, baby, come on. Let's go. Swing away.
Come on. Let's go. Swing away.
Throw the heat, Sam. She can't hit what she can't see.
Here we go.
Strike three!
There we go.
You're out!
Come on.
Sorry, sistah.
Hey, what are you talking about?!
In where... Hey.
How was that a strike?
In what world was that a strike?
Sorry, I call 'em like I see 'em, brah.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, good. How about this?
How about that?
You see that?
That's me kicking dirt on your shoe.
Do you see that?
All right, guys, remember we were talking about sportsmanship?
This right here, that's not it.
Huh? How about that?
You... out of here!
Okay.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Um, Kame...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.
I saw it, okay?
This is peewee baseball; you can't eject somebody.
You... out of here, too!
Two of you, out of here!
Hey, coach, your phone's ringing.
Thanks, Johnny.
McGarrett.
C.O.D. appears to be two close-contact gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
We get an I.D.?
Uh, he doesn't appear to have any identification on him.
We know how long he was in the water?
Well, based on the condition of his skin,
I say no more than a few hours.
Okay, my guess: he was dumped from a boat,
weighted down with something heavy
until the rope slipped off.
Look at these linear abrasions on his wrists.
They suggest that the victim was tied up and unable to defend himself
while he sustained these facial injuries.
So whoever did this tortured him and beat him before they killed him.
Max, let's get the prints to the lab.
See if we can work out who this guy is
and why it went down the way it did.
Commander.
Yeah?
Okay, thanks.
You good?
Ready?
Let's go.
What are you looking at? What?
What do you mean, "What?"
You don't think I saw that little handoff between you and Max?
What is it?
Read it.
I'm gonna read it.
You, uh... you had Max run your DNA against Wo Fat?
That's right.
Why on earth would you do something like that?
Why... I would do something like that,
because I suspected that we might be half brothers.
You and Wo Fat?
It's the only explanation I could come up with, okay?
Wo Fat-- he's a sociopath,
he's a terrorist, he had my father killed,
yet my mother is protecting him.
She's been protecting him the whole time.
Why would she do that?
I can't figure it out.
But, uh, just so I'm clear, you-you say he's a psychopath,
he's-he's a sociopath,
so you just automatically assume you two are brothers.
Makes sense to me.
I got nothing else. I...
Give me something else.
Well, this clearly states that he is not your brother.
So maybe your mother's just trying to protect you.
From what?
Well, uh, the way I see it,
this thing between you and Wo Fat, it ends two... two ways.
One of which, you are dead.
Uh, so maybe your mother, by visiting him in prison,
she's trying to make peace.
Maybe end the blood feud before someone else gets hurt.
No. No.
Not my mother. Come on, you know Doris.
She's up to something.
She's up to something.
I just wish to hell I knew what it was.
Okay, try it now.
Come on.
Yeah!
All right.
Okay.
Is there anything you can't do?
Cook and clean.
All right, we're in trouble then,
'cause that makes two of us.
Oh, no.
All right, let's get out of here.
You got a little, uh... something.
Okay, so where to?
Hangchow.
About a hundred miles.
You think we'll be safer in the city?
I don't know.
But it's got the closest airport.
So we're getting out of China?
We're not.
You are.
Kono...
you saw what happened back there.
My brother's army will keep coming after us
until we're dead.
So we fight them off like we did back...
No, Kono.
There's no way to win this.
I'm not leaving you.
I didn't come this far to walk away...
You're not listening to me.
You stay with me, we're both dead.
It's just a matter of time.
They'll find us sooner than later.
So we find them first.
What are you saying?
We hit them before they hit us.
Hard.
So they don't get up.
I never liked playing defense.
You're crazy, you know that?
Whoa!
Wow.
Look at this-- reunited.
How's it feel, baby? It feel good?
Yeah, I.T. just installed her.
64-bit core processor.
Next gen ultra HD adjustable display.
Floatware, voice command.
Wow.
That's great-- you two should get a room.
You guys don't want to give her a spin?
No. Look, hey, if, uh, it doesn't heat up a pizza,
I got no use for it.
Chin, did we get the I.D. on the vic from the lab?
Yeah, actually it just came in.
Guy's name is Michael Maki.
As you can see, he's got a rap sheet.
Mostly drug offenses.
Parole puts him as a driver
for Pacific Isles Limousine.
I reached out to the manager there, who told me that Maki
confirmed an airport pick-up a few hours ago.
Now, the client gave his name as John Smith.
And he requested Maki to be his driver by name.
Why would he do that?
That's a very good question
considering the limo company says
that Smith is a first-time customer.
Now, Maki never checked in, so the manager says
that he tried to locate him using the limo's GPS,
but it was disabled once they left the airport.
Okay, well, uh, John Smith.
We know our suspect is very creative.
Yeah, but he gets the job done.
I mean, two shots
to the back of the head,
close range, on a parolee
with a history of drug trafficking.
Body dump to cover up the crime.
I mean, this looks like a hit to me.
Yeah, I'll pull the surveillance footage
from the airport,
both inside and out, along with the flight manifests
for arrivals around the time of Maki's pick up.
Let's see if we can't find this Mr. Smith.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Billy Harrington. What are you doing here, man?
How you doing?
It's been a long time.
Yeah, man, last time I saw you
you were reassigned to some classified op?
Yeah, it was a hot extraction out of North Korea.
Right, that... I'm sorry about that.
No, no problem, don't worry about it.
Look, I'm-I'm sorry that I, uh, dropped by like this,
but I just needed to talk to you and thought it was better
if I did it in person.
Yeah, of course.
Come on in.
What can I do for you, man?
Well, I don't know if you heard, but I cut away from the navy.
Congratulations.
What are you doing for work?
Uh, actually that's why I'm here.
I'm starting a private security firm.
All right.
And I wanted you to hear it from me first
that I offered Catherine
a job running my intel department.
Sounds like a great opportunity
if she was ready to leave the navy.
She didn't tell you, did she?
Uh, no, she didn't.
Me and my big mouth.
Did she take the job?
Actually no, she turned it down.
She say why?
No, but if I had to read between the lines,
I think that she's worried that working with me might affect
her relationship with you.
Come on, man, look.
I know you guys had a thing...
Then you know it's over.
And you know me, we served together,
I would never do anything to get between the two of you.
Come on, Steve.
The only reason I'm here is because Catherine is
hands down the best person for the job.
I know that, look.
She'd be an incredible asset to any team.
Let me talk to her.
All right.
Come check this out.
Are we good?
We're good. Thank you.
I'll walk you out.
So, this is footage
from the arrivals terminal.
Check out the cowboy.
Now we lose him for a minute here.
Then we pick him up outside.
Here.
Chin, freeze that.
Run facial rec.
雷·哈珀
Our killer's a cop.
This happened in '92.
Ray Harper was a rookie
cashing his first paycheck as a ranger.
Hell of a way to start to a career.
Oh, it gets better.
Harper ended up becoming one of the most decorated officers
in the history of the Ranger Division.
Okay, tell me this.
Why would a hero
travel all the way to Hawaii
just to murder a limo driver?
Maybe our victim
is part of a case that Harper was working.
I thought that, too,
but then I spoke to his commander.
Harper was injured in a shoot-out a little while ago.
He was riding a desk for six months.
He's supposed to be on vacation.
Nothing says R and R
like whacking somebody out, right?
Yeah, flagged him with Homeland Security.
Neither Harper nor his alias has shown up
in any passenger manifests leaving the island.
Okay, uh, Harper comes here to kill Maki.
He's already done that. What's he still doing here?
Maybe he's not finished.
Now is that any way to welcome a man into your home?
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm just, uh, looking for a guy and a girl.
I'm told you know where I can find them.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.
Michael Maki says you do.
Who?
Okay.
You want to play that game?
What the hell do you want, man?
I prefer chunky, but this'll do.
Everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
I heard Billy stopped by.
Billy did stop by.
About that... Yeah, listen.
The only reason I didn't say anything to you
about leaving the navy was because I wasn't sure.
And-and that was a decision that I had to make on my own.
On your own or with Billy?
Okay, no, listen.
My C.O. told him that I was thinking
about resigning my commission.
I haven't even submitted my letter yet.
So you're actually serious about this.
I've spent half my life in the navy, Steve.
It's like I need to start thinking about what's next.
All right, so why would you, uh,
why would you turn down the job with Billy?
Not right for me.
Catherine,
it's tailor-made for you-- recon and surveillance,
risk assessment, protection services?
Please.
Why would you say no?
Because I'm really happy right now.
I mean, things are good between us.
And I don't want a job--
even if it's the perfect job--
to get in the way of that.
Steve?
HPD just found Maki's limo
parked outside a house in Waipahu.
Excuse me.
Okay, tell HPD to secure the perimeter.
No exits, no entries.
We're on the way.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna miss seeing you in those cammies.
I got to go.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Look what arrived.
Beautiful, huh?
Looks nice.
What are you doing?
Let's go.
That sounds good.
You're not gonna let me drive my new car?
You're a real jerk, you know that?
You're grinding the thing.
I'm not grinding the thing.
What are you talking about?
This thing is an animal. Let me tell you about...
Zero to 60 in under five.
Under five, okay? Mm-hmm.
Corners like it's stuck to the road.
It's a dream. I love this car.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I am. I am.
Good.
Are you enjoying yourself as much as you enjoyed
having that conversation with your girlfriend's ex-boyfriend?
What are you talking about? Billy's...
Billy's opening a private security firm, okay?
He heard Catherine was leaving the navy.
He wants to offer her a job.
Came to me out of respect
to make sure it was okay.
Aha!
Okay, well, uh, I'm gonna just take a stab here.
Did he tell you that, uh, offering her the job
has nothing to do with their past relationship,
all due respect to you,
and that she-she's the only person for the position?
Yes, that's actually exactly what he said.
Ha, that's funny.
Did he also say that you should convince her to take the job?
Which, by the way is a terrible idea.
Wait-wait, stop, stop.
Okay.
Billy's a solid guy.
"Guy" being the operative word here.
The guy who is gonna be working
long, hard hours with your beautiful,
intelligent, sexy, attractive girlfriend.
Danny, Billy and I served together.
We saw action together.
He's all about integrity and character.
That is exactly why it is a terrible idea.
That doesn't make any sense.
You see, that is why you will never see it coming, pal.
You are complacent, okay?
You need to fortify your position.
At all times, at all times,
you need to protect your queen like, uh, chess.
No, not like in chess, Danny.
In chess, the Queen is a fighting piece,
and you use her to protect the King.
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay.
It was a metaphor.
It was a metaphor for you losing
the best thing that ever happened to you.
There's nothing to worry about.
Catherine, she turned the job down.
Good. Her decision?
Yeah, I told her to take the job.
Very good. Her decision.
Makes you look like the confident, understanding, boyfriend.
Everything is good.
All right.
She's gonna need a job, Danny.
We'll get her a job!
You know, there's got to be
a testosterone-free workplace somewhere on this island.
I mean, we'll get her a job at a convent, nice women's charity,
sell donuts, I don't know. Something.
The point is, it is good
that she did not take that job, trust me.
Trust me. As a friend, I know these things.
Duke.
No one's been in or out since we got here.
That's Maki's limo.
We know who owns this place?
It's a rental.
Name on the lease is Tom Akuna.
He has priors for drugs and assault with a firearm.
No known association with our suspect Harper.
Okay, let's go.
Clear.
I'm clear.
Clear.
I got fresh blood.
All right, well, if Harper killed Akuna,
then where is the body?
I got at least 75K here.
Ah, so he wasn't obviously after the money.
All right, Harper left the limo here,
which means he's gotta be driving Akuna's car, right?
Chin, find out what that is,
get an APB out.
We find that car, we find our killer.
You're dead! You hear me?
You son of a bitch! You're a dead man!
You don't know who you're dealing with.
You were born here, right?
What's it to you?
I was making small talk.
It took me ten hours and two planes to get here.
Not a whole hell of a lot to do
sitting in a tin can at 30,000 feet.
Of course, there's movies,
but for my money, they haven't made a good one since Godfather.
Godfather?
Arguably, Part II was a better movie,
but that's just a matter of taste.
What the hell are you doing?!
You ever read those in-flight magazines, Tom?
You know, the ones they stick behind the seat with the vomit bags?
Most people don't pay much mind.
They're too busy listening
to music or watching the aforementioned crap
that passes for entertainment.
Me? Call me old-fashioned,
but I'm a reader.
I'll read anything you put in front of me.
And those in-flight magazines, they're good reading.
For instance, there was this one story
about the rat population on this island.
Seems that those nasty little rodents just ruined
the sugarcane crop.
Then about a hundred years ago some genius decided
to import Indian mongoose from Jamaica
to exterminate those rats.
Now, on the surface, that seemed like a hell of a good plan,
cause the mongoose is a natural predator of the rat,
but what our well-intentioned friend didn't understand was
that this particular species of rat is nocturnal.
Which means they're active at night.
Whereas the mongoose is diurnal.
Yeah, yeah, I had to look that one up, too.
It means they're a daytime creature.
So, as you can imagine, those rats to this very day
are running around these fields all night long.
And you know what they like even more than sugarcane?
I'll give you one guess.
Hey, you can't do this to me.
You hear me?!
Seems to me it's already done.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna hit the road.
When it comes to rats, I'm a little squeamish.
Hey, you can't do this to me! You hear me?!
Okay, all right.
Those two you're looking for, I know where they are.
Where is she?!
Start talking,
or so help me God, I'll put a bullet in your face.
Hey! Five-O! Drop the gun.
Drop the gun right now.
Come back later.
It's over, Ray.
Put down the gun. Come on.
I'm about to question this young man
on a very pressing matter.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing that.
I'm about to shoot you in the back of the head
if you don't put that gun down, Ray.
I'm guessing you gentlemen are packing nines,
which means you have plenty of firepower.
The question is, how fast are you on the trigger?
Me, I got a simple six-shot Colt,
but I'm quick and I'm one hell of a shot.
Chances are, we tangle,
one of you is going down.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Put the gun down.
You're making a big mistake.
You know, Michael Maki's body
washing up on that beach like that?
That was shoddy work, Ray.
It was very disappointing
for a man who is supposed to know
how to cover his tracks.
I mean, you disabled the GPS in the limo,
but you missed
the tracking system on Akuna's car.
What's the matter with you, Ray?
You might as well have sent us an invite
to the kid's hotel room.
Tell me, were you gonna kill that kid
like you killed Maki?
I didn't kill Maki.
And I suppose you didn't kill Akuna either.
That's right.
Then why don't you tell me where he is then?
All right, Carl, maybe, uh,
maybe you could help me out with something.
I got, uh, I got seven unsolved robberies
the last 24 hours, all over town.
Our suspect is a white male,
black ski mask,
uh, silver gun.
Total take, about six grand in small bills.
What, uh, what can you tell me?
Okay, explain something to me.
Why is it that a kid
with no record till today
would travel 4,000 miles to Oahu
to, uh... commit a bunch
of silly-ass stickups?
What, they don't have convenience stores in San Antonio?
It's-it's not what you think.
Okay, well, then enlighten me, please.
And start by telling me how you know Ray Harper,
and why would he put a gun in your face?
No?
Who's that?
Hmm? Nobody?
Who is it?
See, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say that you-you care a lot about this girl, okay,
cause the smile on your face right here is a lot different
than the look you got on your face right now.
I know something is going on,
and know that it's a lot bigger
than these goofy little stickups, okay?
So tell me what it is,
and I will help you, I promise.
Okay, so my guy's not saying anything,
but he's got a friend.
I'm thinking we can get to her,
we could maybe get some answers.
Who is she?
Who is she, Ray?
It's the same girl, Ray. Who is she?
Is this your daughter?
Is she your daughter?
Her name is Amanda, and she's not just my daughter.
She's my life.
Okay, well, do Amanda a favor
and trust us on this, okay?
You need to tell us. Where is she?
Is she in trouble?
I don't know.
Couldn't find her.
That kid you stopped me from questioning knows where she is.
Carl, you have five seconds, okay?
Five seconds to tell me where Amanda is
or I'm gonna let her father come in here
and ask you himself, and I promise you,
he's not gonna be as polite as me, okay?
Look, I-I-I don't know where she is. I swear.
This whole thing just got way out of hand.
What whole thing?
I got involved with some guys
that I went to school with back in San Antonio.
They offered me two grand, a limo and a couple plane tickets.
All I had to do was take a bag of cash
out to some of their friends in North Shore.
And they told me
to bring a girl because it would be less suspicious.
Amanda, she didn't know anything about any of this.
Okay, how much cash?
$75,000.
Did you make the delivery?
No, no. We got robbed on the way.
Some guy in a ski mask jacked us at a stoplight.
Okay, well, either they are the luckiest thieves on planet Earth
or you were set up.
That kid wasn't even on my radar.
Amanda doesn't talk to me about boys.
What about Amanda's mother?
She took off when Amanda was three.
I've been raising her on my own ever since.
About two weeks ago, Amanda started begging me
to let her go on a trip to Hawaii
with a girlfriend's family.
She's a good kid, she's never been in trouble.
I had no reason not to trust her.
I told her to call me when she got settled.
She never did.
She wouldn't go 24 hours without calling me.
It's just not the way she was raised.
I tried her phone,
but every time I called, it went straight to voice mail,
so I did some digging.
Found out she didn't go with her girlfriend,
she went with this Jacobson kid.
And I followed his trail.
Okay, so that's how you found Michael Maki.
With a little Texas charm,
he told me he picked the kids up.
They were supposed to drop off a bag of money
when they got robbed.
Then he drove 'em to his middleman Akuna's house
to figure out what to do.
Well, so who killed Maki?
I don't know.
When I left him, he was hurting,
but very much alive.
Well, what about Akuna?
I cut him loose once he pointed me towards Jacobson.
This guy Akuna
sent me to... to meet his boss.
He told me if I told his boss everything,
he sh-should understand.
Let me guess: he didn't understand.
No.
Why would you not come to us in the beginning, Ray?
No offense,
but I don't know you.
Which means I don't trust you.
When I looked into this,
I realized Amanda could be in some trouble
with some real players.
I wouldn't put her life in your hands or anyone else's.
Ballistics came back on the bullets
Max pulled from Maki's skull.
They're not a match to Ray's Colt.
All right, so Ray's telling the truth.
Okay, uh, the kid messed up.
The guys that he was supposed to deliver the money to,
they have Amanda.
If they don't get the money in 48 hours,
they are going to kill her.
What are you doing?
Let's go find your daughter.
Don't move. Don't move!
Turn the water off.
You set those kids up.
Maki told you about the money drop,
you two figured it'd be an easy score.
Who killed Maki?
The guys that we work for.
That's a smart move, ripping off your bosses.
Right, they know it was an inside job.
They don't know we took their cash.
Maki's dead
because they found out he talked to a cop.
Which makes you their next victim.
You guys have to take me with you, yeah?
You want my protection?
Why don't you tell me where Amanda is?
She's not with Carl. Where is she?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
So according to Akuna,
Amanda's probably being held
in one of the upstairs bedrooms in this house.
距离嫌犯住处一英里
Okay, look.
It's really simple.
You're gonna go in there-- look at me--
give 'em the money,
get Amanda back, get the hell out of there.
Make sense?
I'm gonna need a "Yes" Or "No""
Uh, I think so.
That'll do.
All right, Carl.
It's go time, buddy. Saddle up.
"Saddle up"? Really?
Thought it was appropriate.
Relax, Carl. You can do this.
Okay? Everything's going to be fine.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just here for Amanda.
I... I have the money. It's all right here.
Whoa. Hey, wait!
Wait... wait, hey,
what are you doing? Hey, you-you said if I...
if I brought you the money...
I have all the money, it's right here.
Now, where's... where's Amanda?
Change of plans.
What... what do you mean,
change of plans? Where's Amanda?
I got a better deal.
I sold her.
Hey! No, no, please!
I did what you asked!
Where's my daughter?
Hey, stupid.
Amanda?
Daddy!
Amanda! Hold on, baby!
Daddy!
Amanda.
Daddy, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

Danno, what do you want me to do?
What I want you to do? I want you to go have fun.
Do whatever feels right, all right? Okay.
Keep your eye on the ball and have fun.
Listen to your dad, all right?
Wow, thank you.
All right, come on.
All right, Shrimps, let's go!
Come on, number seven, what do you say? What do you say?
What do you say? Go, number seven.
Have fun up there, let's go.

Little outside, monkey.
Good swing, a little outside.
Let's go, keep your eye on the ball.
Shrimp dogs!
It's all right, hang in there.
Here we go, Grace!
Come on!
All right, wait for the pitch now,

Take the job.
Steve, I'm not...
No, no, listen to me, Catherine.
We're good.
Nothing's gonna change that.
Strike two!
Good job, monkey.
Good swing.
Just have fun up there, babe, okay?

There's no kissing in baseball, Steve.
Sorry!
What do you mean, time out?
Love.
Let's play ball!
All right, all right, here we go, Grace.
Come on, monkey, be a batter up there,
be a batter up there.
Wait for the pitch, now,
wait for the pitch, you got this.
All right.
Now, monkey, run! Go, go, go!
Go, monkey, run!
Go, go, go!
Gracie!
