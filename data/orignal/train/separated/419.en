I believe humanity was born from conflict.
Maybe that's why in all of us lives a dark side.
Some of us choose to embrace it.
Some have no choice.
The rest of us fight it.
And in the end,
It's as natural as the air we breathe.
At some point,
All of us are forced to face the truth.
Ourselves.
For me that day has come.
My god!
You look so beautiful.
No, no, no, don't cry.
Your mascara will bleed.
Look at you. So perfect.
My hands...
I--I can't feel my hands.
Please, cut me loose.
She has that something special
so few have these days, don't you think?
What do you want from me?
What you desire most.
I saw it the moment I set eyes on you.
Saw what?
Fame.
You will never look more beautiful than this moment right now.
I was 18 when I faced a man who chose to embrace his dark side,
And by doing so, he took my humanity.
Every day since I have put on a mask
to hide what now suffocates me...
the truth.
And nothing speaks louder than the truth.
Out of the shadows,
A taxi pulls into the alleyway.
She moves into the light,
Radiant, captivating.
Out of the shadows, Robert sees her.
Never has she looked more beautiful than this moment right now.
There's a sadness to her.
For a moment, I didn't think you'd come.
I had to.
What is it?
What if...
What if all we have
is all we were meant to be?
No! no. No.
It's had. Past tense. Had.
Not have. Try it again.
I can't. Not like this.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Otherwise you'll relieve the audience.
Fight back the tears and they'll cry for you.
Untie my hands. Let me move.
I'll get it. I swear.
Hold the moment and you hold the audience.
What if all we had
Was all we were meant to be?
My love, oh, my love,
To my grave I will carry you in my heart.
Oh, wait, please!
Please, let me try it one more time!
This is all you were ever meant to be.
No, I can do it. I promise.
You'll never grow old.
No, well, wait, wait. Just give me one more chance.
You should leave now.
I can do it! Oh, god.
Please, no, let me do it one more time, please.
Oh, god, I don't want to die! No, no--
Melissa Crane?
Get out.
Alison Gardner?
Get out before I call the police.
I called them. And they'll be here,
But not before I'm done.
Done?
Done with what?
Nine girls you raped and you butchered.
You took from them what you took from me.
But I survived.
You should have killed me, Gardner.
Detective Croft?
I've seen a lot over the years,
But nothing like this.
Like what?
I didn't notice it at first,
But then when I saw it, I knew I had to call you.
Look at her face, Prentiss.
Yep.
I guess you guys have seen it all.
Thought I had.
What do you make of it?
Nothing good.
All right, listen, I need wide-angle shots of her body, torso,
Close-ups of her face and her mouth.
Whoever did this has a mind I don't want to understand.
That's a luxury we can't afford.
Kelly Landis went missing 3 days ago.
2 days ago, the Georgetown "monitor" received this.
So whoever took this, took Kelly.
And wanted the world to know it.
Is that you?
Where was she found?
Uh, she was found in Georgetown, in an alley,
Late last night.
I sent Morgan and Prentiss.
Only one victim?
It's what he did to her that concerns me.
Morgan sent these, also late last night.
He and Prentiss are waiting in the district.
The body seems posed.
Left arm raised...
Oh...that's a first. I see your concern.
What?
A photo wasn't all he took.
Reid, what?
Her lips have been removed.
Oh, my god.
Maybe a trophy.
Maybe he ate them?
Ok, now I have that memory
burned in my mind for the rest of my life.
You asked.
The photo he sent to the "Monitor"
And the way her body's posed and the mutilation,
It must be a representation of someone.
At least by sending a photo,
the media's opened a line of communication.
Now that he's got the media's attention,
we can expect more of these.
Now for this late-breaking news.
Kelly Landis was found dumped in an alley late last night.
And I've been informed her body was mutilated by the killer.
The FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit
Has been called in to investigate.
This is Taylor Conwright, WVDC News.
"Fame will go by, and so long I've had you, fame.
国会山
"If it goes by. I've always known it was fickle,
"so at least it's something I experienced,
but that's not where I live."
Marilyn Monroe.
33 years. 2 days left to retire.
Not once did I have my name in print.
Now it's alongside a 22-year-old girl
left butchered in an alley.
Who found her?
Homeless guy.
We need to compile a list of Kelly's direct relatives,
friends, co-workers, boyfriends, everyone.
When we got the photo,
I expected a ransom, not a body.
This isn't about money. It's about that.
Attention.
By sending in the photo,
the unsub's handiwork becomes the center of attention.
It wasn't sent. It was walked into the "monitor" building.
No one saw a thing.
From here on out, nobody talks to the press.
The last thing we need is the media naming her killer.
It'll have an emotional effect on her killer,
But positive or negative, neither one will help.
You know, you guys usually work serial murders.
All we have is Kelly.
What you have is unique,
In fact. It's a first for all of us.
Kelly represents someone specific
to the unsub.
Love and hate
in equal measure.
What the hell does cutting her lips off represent?
It's a fetish, an obsession linked either
to a profoundly deep love or possibly disgust of lips.
As Morgan pointed out,
Emotions that are in direct conflict with one another.
It's his signature.
And not one that's on any database.
I love to sit and watch people go by.
You can tell a lot by the way someone walks.
The way they hold their head.
Take that lady over there...
The blonde with the ponytail,
In the gray dress. You see her?
That one?
No, no, no. Don't point. That's rude.
That is not a walk.
She's keeping her head down
And avoiding eye contact. You know why?
No.
Everyone's in her way.
She's either late for something or...
mad at the world.
Mad at the world.
That's why I've always told you, Rhett,
Never have children.
I'm going to go buy some flowers.
You see that, how she glides,
You can't take your eyes off her?
How do you walk?
I can show you.
I'd like that.
The office for the Georgetown "monitor" is here on M Street.
Kelly's body was found in Rykers Alley here.
3 blocks west is where he hand-delivered Kelly's photo.
And 10 blocks farther east
are offices of practically every major media outlet.
Why choose the "monitor"?
He reads it or it's his comfort zone.
You think he lives in Georgetown?
Until we find signs of sexual assault,
we can't be sure it's a he.
It says that Kelly lives in Alexandria
but she works on the hill. Is that correct?
She didn't have a chance. It was her first day as a senate page.
What time was she supposed to report for work?
9 a.m. Neighbors saw her leave in the morning.
She didn't have a car.
She used the bus or the metro,
no one saw her.
Can we see a copy of the autopsy report?
Happening downstairs as we speak.
And we'd like to see a list of everyone
you've interviewed so far.
It's on my desk. I'll get it.
Kelly's body was dumped in the district.
It's likely that she was abducted and killed here, too.
Then he's local.
And MPD's done a comprehensive neighborhood canvass.
They have.
They've probably already interviewed the unsub.
That's a great walk.
Really quite wonderful.
My mother says,
when you're a movie star,
you have to have a walk.
'cause when you're on a screen 15 feet high,
you better have a good walk.
And when you win that Oscar,
you gotta walk across that red carpet like you own it.
Stunning.
You think so?
No, I think you're an ugly little girl
who has nothing to give to the world.
Mommy!
If she was offered food or water,
she didn't accept it.
Her stomach's empty, and she's dehydrated.
Not that she could have accepted anything.
She was restrained.
Dr. Hecht, did you find any signs of sexual abuse?
No.
Cause of death?
Suffocation.
But not manual strangulation.
Was the mutilation post- or antemortem?
Post.
Never get used to that.
There's something in her throat.
9 a.m. is a busy time of day to be abducting someone.
If she didn't know who took her, that's high-risk.
Well, maybe agent Hotchner and the whiz kid are wrong.
Maybe she was brought into the district by somebody she knew.
No one's going to bring a victim into D.C.
unless their base of operations is here.
This is definitely his comfort zone.
Ok, so day one, Kelly's abducted.
Day 2, the media gets a photo of her.
Day 3, her body's found here posed.
This all feels orchestrated.
Well, if you orchestrated all of this,
wouldn't you want to see it?
Why else leave a body here?
I'll get one of my men to film the crowd.
Morgan, isn't this crime scene sealed off?
There's someone in here.
The air must have dislodged it,
Otherwise I'd have seen it.
Thanks.
A page from a book?
I don't know. It's old paper.
The blood and the saliva has sort of smudged the words.
There's a lot of text.
It appears... to be in old courier.
You know what?
It's typed, not printed.
"nothing moves in the street.
"a cool breeze and gentle rain
"do little to silence Robert's beating heart."
From the time Kelly was found,
how long had she been dead?
Lividity indicates half an hour.
Georgetown's where he kept her captive.
Trihalomethane was found in her hair.
Chloroform?
Who uses chloroform nowadays?
You know, chloroform, the glamour shots--
It all feels like a throwback to another century.
Where were you last night?
Jail.
There was a homeless man here,
6 feet tall, beard, late 40s.
Impossible.
No, there was definitely somebody right here last night.
This place is my place.
This alley's my home.
Ain't nobody down here but me.
Do we have a problem here?
The homeless guy who found Kelly's body, where is he?
He was right here.
He flagged down a patrol car and he brought them back here.
You mind if I take a look?
Do I have a choice?
Did you write that on the wall?
Son of a bitch wrote on my walls!
No, no, hey, hey! don't touch that, please, sir.
Sir, that is evidence that we need.
Come here.
Please.
"Robert hangs in the shadows,
"just as his life now hangs in the balance.
But life without love is no life at all."
We would be awesome together.
Aren't we already?
Like us, they are perfectly matched,
but the are not found on any database.
On what, then?
On that piece of paper found shoved down kelly's throat.
The same words?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Derek, what is it? You're doing that silence.
It means you're onto something.
I'll call you back.
Hotch was right.
You have interviewed the unsub.
How do you know that?
Because the writing on the wall is the same
as what was stuffed down Kelly's throat.
The homeless man who found Kelly's body
wasn't homeless.
Excuse me?
He was wearing a disguise.
Read to me, Rhett.
You know I love it when you read to me.
I'm tired.
I'm so tired.
Rhett,
Come upstairs and read to me.
Scene 43.
You know how I love the way you play it.
Oh, I can't sleep when you don't read to me.
Baby, I need you.
Coming, Mom.
Just a minute.
Just a minute, I'm nearly done.
Get up here now!
Rhett?
Rhett.
"Agents of the BAU investigate the Hill Ripper."
Why are they saying these things?
You're so much like your father was.
Really?
Tell me. Please.
You're weak.
What?
You're weak just like he was.
I did this.
Not you! Not my father!
A few bad words from the press and look at you.
"Why are they saying all these things about me?"
He was gutless and he was pathetic,
But at least your father knew how to walk like a man!
He gave you nothing.
I've given you my life!
And I am reminded of that every day.
Oh, please! Don't say that!
Do you have any idea what you have cost me?
What I could have been?!
She looks so much like me.
But she's not you, mom.
Look at her.
Look at her, Mom!
Is that the work of a weak man?
In a matter of hours, she'll be more famous than you ever were.
I can't match the words, sir,
But if they're from a film, it's got to be the 1950s.
Are you sure?
Well, the picture that he sent of Kelly to the "monitor,"
Kelly's makeup, ok,
The foundation is like a pearl color.
And over it is this green powder.
That powder gives it a whiter look.
Her eyebrows are plucked.
Her cheeks are that flushed rose hue that is totally that era.
But what really seals it is the dark eyeliner.
She has bedroom eyes.
That was Marilyn Monroe's trademark.
Well, if Kelly's supposed to represent Monroe,
then the text we found may be from one of Monroe's movies.
Yeah, I know, it's not much, but...
No, no, no, it helps the profile.
Sir...
Garcia, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
when I asked about your play.
I certainly didn't mean to.
Oh, oh, I know. I just, um...
Really, I gotta ask you that you don't
share that with anyone, please.
Of course.
Oh, and one other thing.
I was thinking, Kelly was missing for 3 days,
And most stories-- plays and films--
I know, have a 3-act structure.
Not unlike your play.
You know, I saw the original production in New York.
Well, we sort of adapted it.
Good.
Thanks.
Penny Hanley, 19. She lives in Arlington,
Works in an art gallery.
Yesterday she didn't make it to work or back home.
She caught the metro to Union Station.
Her father dropped her off.
Her purse was found a few blocks away on a side street.
It's most likely where she was abducted.
Kelly was taken for 3 days.
If he's holding to pattern, Penny's already on day 2.
Today the Georgetown "monitor"
Will receive a photo.
Whatever happens, we cannot allow another photograph
Like Kelly's to be published.
We need to get ahead of the media.
They've already named him "the Hill Ripper."
I want undercover units to lock that building down.
And if you see him, let him walk in.
Do not apprehend him before.
We're looking for a white male in his mid to late 40s,
Approximately 6 feet tall, slim build.
We think he's a local and a loner,
And he's most likely unemployed.
He's moving his victims around the city unseen,
So we know he has a vehicle.
It's probably an older model, but well maintained.
What does he think this is?
A page from what we believe is a script
Was found inserted in kelly's throat.
Somehow in the unsub's mind,
Kelly seems to have failed expectations.
Although there were no sexual interactions
Ante or postmortem,
The removal of the lips is in itself a sexual act.
A behavior which tells us we're dealing
with a borderline personality.
Based on the obvious theatricality of the case,
We think he worked in or around the arts.
3 days may represent a 3-act play, of which Kelly was the star.
Kelly was killed 3 days after she was abducted.
That means Penny may only have a day left.
Look up.
Oops. I missed one.
Oh, yeah.
Wowza.
You want to see?
I just want to go home.
Trust me.
I've had a lot of practice.
You look great.
What do you think?
You like it?
She didn't have it.
I thought she did, but she didn't.
You have it in spades, my dear.
I don't want to be famous.
We all want to be famous.
This building has 3 exits--
North, south, and west.
You're here to target a woman,
But you don't want to attract attention.
Well, standing in the middle
Gawking at passing women, would certainly attract attention.
Like you're doing now.
What's that?
Just like that, I.Q. Of 187 is slashed to 60.
But sitting and reading the paper
Would give him an excuse to watch
Without being noticed.
Far enough away not to attract attention
But close enough to make sure she's the right one.
You know, she works 15 blocks east of here.
Her father said she walked through this train station every day.
If he were sitting here,
He's on camera.
How many cameras cover the area?
3, but only 2 are operable-- cameras 8 and 7.
Can you go back to yesterday around 4 p.M.?
Ok, camera 7. There she is.
Can you bring up camera 8?
Can you enlarge it and keep it rolling, please?
See the girl walking in front of the man?
Well, he's seen Penny. Look.
Can you go back to the exact moment that he sat down?
Freeze it right there.
From the moment that he left the station,
He sat there for over 3 hours.
We profiled he has his own vehicle.
It was the only way he could abduct Penny off the street.
3 hours exceeds any parking meter.
Get all this footage to garcia.
This is where her purse was found.
This has to be where he grabbed her.
High-risk but possible.
Chloroform's old-school, but it's quick.
They got the guy on tape stalking Penny.
They have an I.D. On him?
Not yet. Hotch seems to think
that he may have some type of parking permit.
This entire street is parking permit only.
Well, maybe he has some kind of work permit.
A guy like this can't hold down a job.
A resident permit would give him all the time he needed.
Permits go by zone.
Then we need to shut this area down.
This is where he lives.
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
I want to get this scene on its feet.
To do that, you'll need these.
My toes are pushing at the end.
I need some that will fit.
I can do this barefoot.
It'll be quieter. You don't want to wake your mother, do you?
Good thinking.
Some of the lines are missing.
We'll remember them, won't we?
Every...last...word.
Your lips are so beautiful.
What's the scene mean to you?
Love.
Such extraordinary love.
For a moment, I didn't think you'd come.
I had to.
Tonight begins the rest of our lives.
What is it?
I can't do this.
Of course you can.
I've got the tickets.
The train is coming.
We're going to make it.
I'm not so sure.
What is it, my sweet?
What's the matter?
Everything's going to be all right.
What if what we had was all we were meant to be?
My love,
Oh, my love,
To the grave I will carry you in my heart.
Help me!
Somebody help me, please!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
You broke my nose! god!
Help me! Somebody help me!
No! No --
You sick son of a bitch!
No!
You were right.
Your toes were too long.
We closed off this entire area.
Cops are all over it.
They're going door to door
where it's a 5-block-radius with over 2,000 homes.
Unless they get lucky, that could take days.
Undercover units have staked out
the Georgetown "monitor" building.
Garcia, anything on the footage?
Lab is analyzing it frame by frame,
but it was pretty clear
he doesn't know those cameras are on him.
Permits?
Cross-checking with the profile,
we've got male, late 40s,
truck, van, or suv.
That brings it down to 600 potentials.
Garcia, what zone covers Rykers Alley --
M street and Charlotte street?
Two zones.
No, that doesn't help.
Well, come on, I'm the high priestess of all things digital,
but I'm not a god.
What permit covers all zones?
Only one. Disabled.
This guy isn't disabled.
Maybe he knows someone who is.
A kid on a BMX dropped this off
at the "monitor" a half hour ago.
Said a bum gave him 20 bucks.
Well, at least it didn't make the news.
It buys us some time, right?
Until he finds another way to contact the media.
We'll do it for him.
Garcia, I need you here as soon as possible.
Sure. What for?
We need him to break cover, get out in the open.
Call a press conference
with every major media outlet present.
Oh, I am not the one you want in front of that camera.
Yes, you are. Detective, we need every available unit.
Hey. You're gonna be fine.
No, I will not be fine. I will suck.
I will suck. And what happens then?
Penelope. Penelope, stop it.
We just gotta buy some time to get ahead of this guy.
He'll be watching, you mean?
I'm gonna be right by your side.
Now get your butt over here.
Oh, my god.
Every great movie star has a walk.
That's something you'll never have.
Sir, I've thought about this
and I've decided it's a bad idea.
All you have to do is stay calm.
Don't let the room control you.
How am I supposed to do that?
Keep your answers short and to the point.
Don't comment on the Kelly Landis case.
Keep the focus on Penny.
No, sir, I don't think you understand.
I have a phobia about
having a video camera even pointed at me.
I get all nervous and I start to panic
and I forget what I'm gonna say
and my hands get all sweaty
and then my hands start to shake.
My hands are shaking right now.
I cannot do things I am not good at,
and I am not good at being in a room full of strange people.
That's why I stay in a room 6 by 9 feet.
I feel safe there.
Garcia, what about the Tolgate Theater?
Tolgate Theater?
What's that?
It's a small repertory theater in Dean Street
where they do a lot of -- - Reid, we know what it is.
That is not the same thing.
Garcia -- - I--
I can't even look at you right now.
I am mad. I asked you not to say anything.
We need him to see a face and a look that he recognizes.
Well, he likes blondes, and I'm red now.
We can change that.
Toward the end, Morgan's gonna hand you a note.
Take a moment, let the group settle...
and when you have everyone's attention,
read it out.
You're gonna be fine.
You'll be great, Red.
Hey. This isn't about the unsub.
It's about the girls. For him,
it's all about making Penny famous.
Then aren't we helping him realize his dream?
Come on.
We get this right, we end that dream.
The press is calling him the Hill Ripper.
They're gonna want to
sensationalize this story even further.
Now, they're gonna ask you how long he kept Kelly.
They're gonna ask you how she died.
Did he stab her? Did he torture her?
Did he rape her?
How many others has he killed?
Garcia, you have to make it about Penny.
You let whoever has her know
that the entire world is watching,
and then you make Penny the star.
All we gotta do is get this guy to move.
You can do this, baby girl.
Give me your bag.
Ok.
Penny Hanley went missing 2 days ago.
We have received over 3,000 calls.
Her family is obviously deeply worried
and is looking forward to her prompt and safe return.
Isn't Penny Hanley yet another victim of the Hill Ripper?
Right now, all we know is that Penny is missing.
Who sent that photo in
just like the Kelly Landis case?
We'd like to take this opportunity
to reach out to the public.
Penny was last seen here,
leaving Union Station.
You mean she was taken by the Hill Ripper.
Rumors are that Kelly Landis was found
with her lips cut off.
We are not prepared to discuss the details of Kelly's case.
Isn't the mutilation, if fact, what you call a signature?
Penny Hanley's name has captured the attention
of not only the nation, but also the entire world.
This photo is the most recent image...
You hear that? The whole world knows who you are.
We believe it was taken and sent by the person...
I'm so thirsty. I need water.
She never got that kind of attention.
They love you.
Penny Hanley.
The whole world knows your name.
I want to say something. I want to say
something to the sick son of a bitch that has my daughter.
Mr. Hanley, we all want to find your daughter,
Daddy.
But you really need to calm down.
Let daddy talk. Come on, daddy,
I want to hear what you have to say about this little girl.
Mr. Hanley, don't do this.
You know, I say something, she dies,
I plead for her life, she dies.
I don't have any money, my wife passed away 2 years ago.
She is all I have, and if this sick bastard gets away with this--
Just let me say something.
Taylor Conwright, WCDC news.
Prentiss and Reid are moving north down M street.
What would you like to say to the man who has your daughter?
She's losing the room. Morgan's gotta do this now.
If the Hill Ripper is watching, what would you tell him?
I hope this works.
The M.E. Said .
Kelly was killed only a half an hour before she was dumped.
That means he must have killed her in his car.
My little girl right now is in your hands.
That's right. That's right.
She is in my hands.
And what did you do? Nothing.
Maybe she's already with god.
Either way, your life will be in my hands.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just received this...
He's going to find you.
Shh! shh!
...that the general public reduce their movements
around m street, Georgetown, for the next few hours.
Do you have a lead in the Hill Ripper case?
Agent Garcia, do you have a lead in the Ripper case?
No, we don't. We have an address.
Rhett, what have you done to us now?
Why can't you get anything right?
I got this, mom. I got this. Just don't answer the door, ok?
Rhett, please don't leave me.
I can't be in this house alone.
I hate the dark. You know I hate the dark.
I love you, mom. Just go upstairs and turn out the lights
And do not answer the door.
If he's moving, he's moving now.
Slow down. There, in the alley.
Reid, where are you?
We're headed south down Jackson Street.
There's hardly anything moving.
Except cop cars. We've seen 5 in the last 10 minutes.
Hotch, if he's out here, he's got nowhere to go.
Life without love...
Is no life at all.
Back up.
Aah! No!
There's somebody in there.
No!
FBI!
Call an ambulance. Penny.
Penny, it's ok. You're gonna be all right.
Prentiss, Reid, unsub is headed south.
He just passed you.
There's an ambulance on its way.
Penny, your dad's going to meet us at the hospital.
He got away, but you hit him.
We found traces of blood down the alley.
K-9 units are on the way.
We'll get him, though. I promise.
Agent Hotchner.
Yes?
Please don't leave me.
Go ahead. We've got this.
Thank you.
This car has a disabled permit.
Registered to who?
May Walden. The unsub is Rhett Walden, her son.
Yeah, guys, we have an address. 1503 Hope street.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
The photo--it's exactly the same as Kelly and Penny.
When was it taken?
1956. It's a set photo from a movie called
"Reflection of Desire."
May was 19 when this was taken.
She's got to be over 70 by now.
Yeah. M street, Rykers alley,
They were all locations on this film.
It was the only movie she ever made, and...
She was 4 months pregnant when this picture was taken.
Which ended her career.
And the father?
Co-star.
Derek, do you think she made her son do all of this?
Penelope, I think she made her son do a lot more than this.
Rhett Walden, this is the police!
We know you're in there.
Come out with your hands up.
You hear that, mommy?
They're calling for us.
I told you this day would come.
You didn't believe it.
But here it is.
Are you ready?
I'm ready, my sweet love.
This is the police.
We know you are in there.
Come out with your hands up.
He's coming out.
What if all we had
is all we were meant to be?
My love,
Oh, my love...
to my grave I will carry you in my heart.
Get down on the ground!
Need a medic!
Rossi.
Her lips.
They're Kelly's.
Here.
Oh, what a gentleman.
Excuse me, missy, but when did you
plan on telling me?
Oh, I wasn't gonna tell you.
We all have things for ourselves.
You know, you have property, I have the theater.
Can you at least tell me what it's about?
Mm-hmm. It's about a woman who's attacked by a serial killer.
But she catches him and she knocks him out,
And she keeps him for days.
Garcia, of all the plays in the world,
You choose something like that?
I get to vent.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How does it end?
If I told you that, it wouldn't be a surprise,
Would it?
I believe humanity was born from conflict.
Maybe that's why in all of us lives a dark side.
Some of us embrace it.
Some have no choice.
The rest of us fight it.
In the end,
It's as natural as the air we breathe.
At some point,
We're forced to face the truth.
