&quot; slippers for the stubborn . &quot;
mules .
morning .
good morning . coffee ?
yeah , i &apos;d love some ,
but we have a dead girl in kenmore square .
we do ? oh .
my phone must have been off .
hi , jack .
morning , jane .
he knows he can come out here , right ?
well , he can &apos;t , actually , until he finds his pants .
i &apos;ve looked everywhere .
nice .
and on a school night , no less .
ladies .
maura , is thursday still good to bring allie by ?
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
great .
see you , jane .
good -- good luck with your pants .
don &apos;t you think that was a little terse ?
i &apos;m sorry .
men in kimonos make me uncomfortable .
&quot; kimono . &quot;
it &apos;s a generic word , like &quot; clothing . &quot;
there &apos;s no plural .
and it &apos;s suitable for both men and women .
you know , in japan , wearing a kimono is called kitsuke .
in america , we call it &quot; walk of shame . &quot;
do us all a favor . buy the man some jammies . come on .
wait . who &apos;s allie ?
jack &apos;s daughter .
her seventh @-@ grade class is doing a career study project ,
and she wants to shadow me for extra credit .
that &apos;s pretty grown up for a seventh grader .
what do you mean by &quot; grown up &quot; ?
boring .
well , do you doubt my abilities to make forensics fun ?
did you hear that sentence that just came out of your face ?
well , if conversation lags , i &apos;ll vamp .
i &apos;ll talk about things that interested me at that age .
such as ?
my favorite books .
or , you know , when i was her age ,
i did a science project on the antimicrobial properties
of common foods .
garlic gets the most press ,
but the cruciferous family is not to be underestimated .
so , your plan &quot; b &quot; is &quot; anne of green gables &quot;
or broccoli .
good luck with that .
danielle mitchell .
let me guess . 20 @-@ something ?
how do you know ?
is there a law that requires people to decorate
their first apartments with the same five posters ?
10 bucks there &apos;s a &quot; breakfast at tiffany &apos;s &quot; poster
on the wall in her bedroom .
oh , you cannot know that .
want to bet ?
taste is an individual &apos;s preference
based on their specific cultural experience .
it is impossible to predict .
no , no , no , wait .
marilyn monroe , white dress , on the subway grate .
20 bucks .
deal .
yes ! pay up , baby .
maybe after .
all right , but don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna forget .
what do we know ?
no forced entry .
doesn &apos;t look like she was robbed .
the neighbors didn &apos;t hear anything last night .
anybody know what time she came home ?
guy across the hall works a night shift ,
said she got in late ,
couldn &apos;t tell if she was with anybody , though .
rigor shows time of death around midnight ,
and lividity indicates she was moved into this position .
well , the bag does suggest asphyxia ,
but i &apos;ll need to confirm it with the lab .
it &apos;s a pretty tidy crime scene ,
especially for somebody who &apos;s been strangled .
well , csru couldn &apos;t pull a print off anything .
it would take time to wipe the surfaces clean .
killer wasn &apos;t in a hurry ,
like they knew nobody was coming home .
look how she &apos;s laid out and how deliberate it is .
like they knew what they were doing .
makes me think it &apos;s because they &apos;ve done it before .
you owe me 20 bucks , dr. isles .
it is on my desk .
but just for the record ,
i do want to say that i think you are underestimating
the merit of danielle &apos;s posters .
what ?
you mean you &apos;re gonna get like a bob marley mosaic in y-- no .
&quot; keep calm and buy shoes . &quot;
ooh , that &apos;s good . i haven &apos;t heard that one .
well , i &apos;m not talking about taste .
i &apos;m talking about the evolutionary basis for cultural trends .
there is no evolutionary basis
for beer hats and foam fingers .
imitation is a survival strategy .
you know , the viceroy butterfly imitates the appearance
of the less @-@ palatable monarch ,
thereby deterring predators and ensuring survival .
for butterflies .
my point is that being unoriginal can have its advantages .
not for danielle .
petechial hemorrhaging confirms
that the cause of death was asphyxiation .
yeah , that &apos;s what we were saying was the m.o.
in our ncic search .
anything so far ?
eh , a few strangulations ,
a few girls in danielle &apos;s demographic ,
but nothing that can prove that this was a repeat killing .
i need a special detail
that can link her to the other victims .
jasmine hess .
okay .
yeah , &quot; hess , jasmine . &quot;
found dead in plymouth county about six months ago .
she was strangled , laid out on her bed .
oh , no , no , her case is unique .
the m.e. --
found a cork ...
in her throat .
well , it looks like there &apos;s something
to your theory of imitation after all .
imitation ? what makes you think it &apos;s not the same person ?
because the guy that did this murder is already in jail .
this side is the plymouth county case ,
and this side is danielle .
two girls killed the same way by two different people .
assuming they got the right guy in the first case ,
this is either a coincidence or a copycat .
tell me about our girl .
well , she worked as a waitress in the back bay .
her credit card records are all pretty normal .
largest expense is a hotel reservation
for next month in hawaii .
probably would have been a nice vacation .
do we know who she was going with ?
still working on it .
other than that , no serious debt , no weird activity .
what about the plymouth county victim ?
we find any connection between them ?
well , they &apos;re about the same age ,
but they didn &apos;t appear to know each other ,
no shared interests , no mutual friends ,
no connections at all .
except they both wound up strangled
with a cork in their throat .
ah , except that .
in the trial records ,
the original killer had dated the victim .
now , he said the cork was his way to shut her up
after she tried to dump him , as in &quot; put a cork in it . &quot;
subtle .
maybe danielle had a boyfriend
who used the cork killing as inspiration ?
possibly , but nobody in her building saw her with anyone .
well , let &apos;s talk to her friends and co @-@ workers .
if there was a guy in her life , somebody knew about him .
already on it .
there is a connection between these girls .
we just have to find it .
so sad .
we were supposed to work a shift together tonight .
what can you tell me about danni ?
she was sweet ...
fun .
we worked every weekend together .
we used to hang out after closing all the time .
you used to ?
before the package entered the picture .
what &apos;s &quot; the package &quot; ?
we think he was her boyfriend .
she stopped hanging out ,
was always on her phone during breaks ,
except out in the alley instead of in the back
where the rest of us took calls .
it was like some big secret .
when did that start ?
a couple of months ago .
all she ever said about him was &quot; he &apos;s the total package . &quot;
we teased her a lot about that .
and she never even told you his name ?
no . i just thought he was into something illegal or married .
do you think she was with him the other night ?
i really don &apos;t know .
but if he did do this , i really hope you catch him .
oh , man .
i never got the appeal of rhinestones on phones .
nothing wrong with a little bling .
come on . it looks like hello kitty threw up on my little pony .
you were saying ?
is that your ... ?
well , in --
you know , in -- that bling is -- is quite tasteful .
you know , in -- in this context ,
i find that i am , uh , pro @-@ bling .
you &apos;re pro @-@ bling ?
bring on the bling .
i could do your phone .
would you ?
if your victim was taking calls out in the alley ,
they were either to her mom or the cable company .
there are no mystery numbers that point to a boyfriend .
what about her hard drive ?
i cross @-@ referenced the pictures on her phone and computer
with the friends in her social @-@ media network .
she &apos;s got a lot of friends ,
but no one that looks like our mystery man .
she was a lot less active online the last six months ,
fewer posts .
if she did have a new boyfriend --
she didn &apos;t want anybody to know about it .
come on , danni . where are you hiding this guy ?
there are a few password @-@ protected files
on her hard drive that i haven &apos;t cracked yet .
any guesses ?
did she have a pet cat or something ?
people do that -- pet names ?
pets , their own birthdays , and the ever @-@ popular &quot; password . &quot;
you &apos;re kidding .
nope .
but i &apos;ve tried all of those .
try &quot; package . &quot;
newspaper clippings .
every one is on the plymouth county murder trial .
why the sudden fascination with a creepy murder trial ?
she did password @-@ protect the file
with her boyfriend &apos;s nickname .
and the co @-@ worker said they met a few months ago .
that &apos;s when the trial started .
her boyfriend &apos;s gonna get her wrapped up in this trial
and he &apos;s gonna kill her the same way ?
if that was his plan ,
it would explain why he wanted her
to keep their relationship secret .
it &apos;s a weird plan .
murderers are weird .
is it possible the prosecution got the wrong guy
and danni was involved with the real killer ?
vince ! what a surprise .
i &apos;m meeting angela for lunch .
would you like to join us ?
oh , thanks . i was just leaving , actually .
are you sure ?
what do you think of this place ?
how do you mean ?
just in general .
what would you say about it if someone asked your opinion ?
too many sprouts .
hi , vince .
we need to talk .
oh , jane .
i didn &apos;t know you were joining us .
i &apos;m here under protest .
she &apos;s here to back me up .
you have a problem ,
and , fortunately , i can help you .
i might have accidentally told her
that you are meeting jack &apos;s daughter tomorrow .
why is that a problem ?
it isn &apos;t , as long as she likes you .
you have to impress her .
okay , so , what do you suggest ?
practice talking about things that interest young girls .
i can do that .
i can !
okay , try me .
what are your thoughts about &quot; pretty little liars &quot; ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s good to lie whether
you &apos;re pretty or little .
do you know who , uh , lady antebellum is ?
is that a person ?
how about lady gaga ?
i am more familiar with &quot; lady and the tramp . &quot;
okay , this is worse than i thought .
look , i took these from my nail salon .
get busy .
how is anyone supposed to retain this ?
well , pretend that they &apos;re all dead if you have to .
but if you want to hit it off with allie ,
don &apos;t stop until you know
the difference between j. lo , cee lo , and l @-@ m @-@ f @-@ a @-@ o .
what ?
anything ?
i &apos;ve combed through every website
danni clicked on in the last year .
nothing unusual .
the only chat room she was in was in a discussion
about making meringue .
it &apos;s a delicate process .
so , unless the boyfriend was a pastry chef ,
we have no idea how she met him .
or how he factored into
the plymouth county case .
no leads from her parents ?
no . they said she was chronically single .
and we have no other suspects ,
so this boyfriend is our guy ,
whoever he is .
i think i got something .
we think there &apos;s a connection between the boyfriend and the case , right ?
what we don &apos;t know is ,
did the boyfriend spark her interest ...
or was she interested in the case
and that &apos;s what led her to the boyfriend ?
yeah . either way ,
i figure somebody who collected
every article about the case
might have actually gone down to the courthouse
and watched the trial herself .
so you pulled security footage .
for the whole trial . look .
she &apos;s there every day .
she comes out at recess ...
sends out some texts , and goes back inside .
she &apos;s always alone .
nina , who is she texting ?
it &apos;s got to be the boyfriend .
no record of texts matching the time stamps on this footage .
&apos;cause that &apos;s not her phone .
the pink bedazzled -- that &apos;s right here .
this is just a plain black phone .
burner , maybe ?
yeah , that &apos;s why we have no records --
she had a separate phone for him .
we -- we got to see what number she &apos;s texting .
okay , a reverse lookup should give us a name .
that can &apos;t be right .
her boyfriend is the plymouth county prosecutor .
start from the beginning , slowly .
our dead girl ...
danni .
danni , who was killed in the same way
as the plymouth county victim ,
also happens to be the girlfriend of the guy
who prosecuted the plymouth county case .
okay .
prosecutor is paul wescourt .
conviction put him on the map .
he &apos;s been a rising star in the d.a. &apos; s office ever since .
he is also very married .
okay .
you -- you keep saying &quot; okay , &quot; and , to me , it seems ...
like the opposite of &quot; okay . &quot;
well , i &apos;m gonna ask a question that i don &apos;t really want to ask .
do we suspect him ?
well , we can &apos;t rule him out , not until we talk to him .
i need to caution you against
jumping to conclusions too early .
okay .
i &apos;m trying to protect
our relationship with the neighboring prosecutor &apos;s office .
paul wescourt has a sterling reputation
and is , by all accounts , a good guy .
a good guy who cheats on his wife .
we &apos;re investigating a homicide here .
we &apos;re not blowing up people &apos;s lives .
i know going easy on a suspect
for political reasons is not your style .
that &apos;s one way to put it .
hence my concern .
about your ability to control your face .
i ...
i have excellent face control .
even with lying , cheating husbands .
oh , yeah .
you &apos;re like buddha on the lotus .
shut up .
traitor .
cool ringtone .
are you talking ?
i @-@ i thought i recognized that ringtone .
is that katy perry ?
no .
i can see why she thought that , though .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of like &quot; roar , &quot; right ?
goodbye to the tiger ?
that &apos;s not how it goes .
oh , it isn &apos;t ?
forget it .
two cupcakes , please .
oh , girls , before you leave , i --
well , i &apos;m doing some field research ,
and i was wondering if you could tell me
how i could have made a better impression on you .
what do you mean ?
well , you know , just some tips , like ,
was i too pushy or too forced ?
too close .
and needy .
great feedback .
thank you .
oh , my gosh .
thank you . hey , detectives .
paul wescourt .
mr. wescourt . vince korsak .
pleasure .
and you must be detective rizzoli .
yeah . thanks for coming down so quickly .
not at all .
the grand jury will still be there in the morning .
what can i do for you ?
please sit down .
we need to talk to you about danielle mitchell . it &apos;s --
it &apos;s not good news , i &apos;m afraid .
well , i @-@ is she okay ?
she was found yesterday in her apartment .
she was strangled to death .
no . no , not danni .
no , there &apos;s go-- got to be a mistake .
i &apos;m sorry .
we need to ask you about the nature --
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
well ...
i @-@ i guess you know that d @-@ danni and i were ...
romantically involved .
when did it start ?
uh ... a few months ago .
listen , y @-@ you &apos;re --
you &apos;re gonna find evidence at the autopsy
if you haven &apos;t already .
we were together -- what was it ? --
t @-@ two nights ago .
yeah , w @-@ w @-@ we were together .
would you be willing to submit a dna sample
so we can confirm that ?
of course .
can you tell us what time you left her apartment ?
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t in her apartment .
look , we realize this is difficult for you , politically .
but the more truthful you can be with us now ,
the better this whole thing will go .
i &apos;ve never been there .
she -- she had neighbors with -- with cameras .
we w @-@ were careful .
burner phone ?
yeah , and -- and meetings were all pre @-@ arranged ,
and , um , we used to meet at a hotel
just around the corner from where she lived .
she would walk home afterward .
what time did she leave the hotel ?
already 11 : 00 .
yeah , i @-@ i spent the night there .
i @-@ i went home in the morning .
we &apos;re gonna need the name of that hotel .
there &apos;s no easy way to ask this ,
but could you ... leave my wife out of it ?
sh @-@ she didn &apos;t know about danni .
she would be devastated .
well , that seems more on you than on us .
yeah , you &apos;re right . but i &apos;m a public figure .
and ... she doesn &apos;t deserve this . please .
we &apos;ll keep it quiet for now .
thank you .
i @-@ i @-@ i could use a minute .
of course .
well , he copped to the affair right away .
i &apos;ll give him that .
he might be a cheater , but he doesn &apos;t seem like a killer .
you say that &apos; cause you want it to be true .
well , if he did kill our girl ,
it &apos;ll be a mess for our department ,
the prosecutor &apos;s office , in the press .
so , yes , i want him to be as innocent as he claims to be .
i want to check his alibi .
you &apos;re telling me you don &apos;t have
a reservation list or a guest log ?
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have one .
i &apos;m saying that some of our guests
prefer not to be in it , and we honor that .
what about credit @-@ card records ?
we take credit cards , but , again ,
some of our guests prefer --
pay cash . yeah . security cameras ?
they don &apos;t record .
right .
do you recognize him ?
no .
would you tell me if you did ?
look , my --
my clients are very private people .
my whole business depends on my discretion .
what you call discretion
i call obstruction of a criminal investigation .
now , i need to know if this guy stayed here two nights ago .
security logs license plates of guests
parked in the garage overnight .
it &apos;s the best i can do .
better than nothing .
looks like wescourt &apos;s car was at the hotel
the night of the murder .
well , that &apos;s a good alibi , right ?
for his car . why do people cheat ?
i mean , i @-@ is there some sort of evolutionary reason ?
well , there is research that links infidelity
to a variant in dopamine receptor d4 .
some call it the thrill @-@ seeking gene .
so , cheating is genetic ?
the variant is genetic ,
but the behavior can be modulated
by the individual , though not in this case , apparently .
the semen was a match to the dna swab
that paul wescourt submitted .
which we expected .
there &apos;s more .
because the surfaces were wiped ,
csru had to take extra @-@ thorough measures at the scene ,
and they pulled the drain stopper out of the shower .
gross .
but worth it .
they recovered hair , which i did a dna profile on .
some of it was danni &apos;s .
some of it was wescourt &apos;s .
so , paul wescourt &apos;s hair is in a shower drain
of an apartment that he claims to have never been in .
and the dna test is conclusive .
well , why would he lie about this ?
he told us the truth about the affair .
maybe he thought he &apos;d covered all of his tracks .
and if he is lying ,
that brings everything he &apos;s said into question .
how can we even know if their relationship was consensual ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to prove forensically .
not to mention the previous case .
i mean , this guy could have done both murders
and put away an innocent man .
well , it is possible that the hair was carried in
on danni &apos;s body and wound up
in the drain when she showered .
it seems unlikely .
that &apos;s what i said ,
which is why i sent csru back to the scene .
and this time , they got a print .
want to guess whose it is ?
so , his mistress is dead ,
his prints are at the scene ,
and his alibi is paper @-@ thin .
did he think he would just lie to our faces
and get away with it ?
let &apos;s go ask him , shall we ?
yes , let &apos;s .
detectives . what a surprise .
i thought we agreed to discretion .
i thought you agreed to tell us the truth .
can we , uh , talk somewhere else ?
we found your dna at the crime scene .
would you like to come with us ?
should we do the whole perp @-@ walk thing ?
hello .
mrs. wescourt , hello .
i &apos;m detective rizzoli .
this is sergeant korsak .
boston homicide .
sorry to barge in on you like this .
oh , it &apos;s no problem . would you like some coffee ?
no , thank you .
we just need paul to come with us .
why ? what happened ?
it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s a mistake .
would you like for us to
talk to your wife about the details of the case ?
carol , please go in the other room while i sort this out .
no . somebody tell me what &apos;s going on this instant .
your husband is under arrest .
for homicide ?
paul .
listen to me .
do not speak to anyone
until you get marty ackerman on the phone .
do you understand ?
marty ? you want me to call our lawyer ?
but you say only guilty people get lawyers .
carol , please , i &apos;m innocent .
this is a mistake . i &apos;ll make bail .
i &apos;ll be back by tonight . please , carol .
paul wescourt ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of danielle mitchell .
oh , my ...
dr. isles ?
my friends call me maura .
come on in , allie .
can i get you anything ?
never autopsy on an empty stomach , i always say .
what do you mean by that ?
i mean ...
this office is great .
i love tribal art ...
especially ritual masks of west africa .
you do ?
the idea that when you put one on ,
you conceptually lose your human identity
and become the spirit represented by the mask --
i mean , it &apos;s the definition of cool .
you do not know how relieved i am to hear you say that .
um , why ?
oh , uh , well , i was --
i was a little nervous that maybe
we wouldn &apos;t have anything in common
and you wouldn &apos;t enjoy hanging out with me .
you were worried about that ?
i tried on a few masks of my own , in fact .
oh , please . but ,
you know , even though i should know better .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s always best just to be yourself .
my mom says that .
i agree with her .
easier said than done sometimes .
tell me about it .
it &apos;s really hard , trying to fit in .
that &apos;s part of the reason that i spend my day with dead people .
nice .
b.p.d. got a call about an altercation
involving one of our suspects .
do you know what happened ?
nope .
but if he &apos;s being held here ,
technically , he &apos;s our suspect .
ooh , isn &apos;t he helpful ?
you got visitors , counselor .
you okay , mr. wescourt ?
yeah .
this man works in the d.a. &apos; s office .
he might as well have had a target on his back .
it &apos;s all right .
why wasn &apos;t he put in protective custody in the first place ?
guess the way we see it , you kill your girlfriend ,
you don &apos;t get special treatment .
i &apos;m sorry about this .
oh , it &apos;s the least of my problems .
my lawyer has been calling carol nonstop .
she ...
she won &apos;t bail me out . she won &apos;t talk to me .
she &apos;s probably pretty confused .
and the phones in my office go right to voicemail .
my staff have jumped ship .
i &apos;m alone .
apparently , my only friends are you two .
put me in here .
oh , hey , you put yourself in here when you lied to us .
i didn &apos;t kill her . i was set up .
by who ? how ?
i don &apos;t know !
all i know is that i loved danni .
and whoever did this to her
is out there while i &apos;m in here .
look who made bail .
guess the word is out . it &apos;s a zoo out there .
ah , the press is calling him the &quot; cutthroat lawyer , &quot;
which is factually inaccurate .
catchy , though .
i @-@ i think we &apos;re gonna need to put up a barricade .
better do it quick .
yeah .
nice job on the bruises .
a lady in processing took pity on me
and loaned me some concealer .
well , i hope it holds up .
you got a lot of press out there .
poor carol .
you should have thought about that before .
let me ask you something .
are you as convinced of my guilt as i am of my innocence ?
it &apos;s not about my certainty .
it &apos;s about evidence , and it &apos;s about facts ,
like the fact that you lied
about being in danni &apos;s apartment .
i know how it looks .
but i also know that i am innocent .
get back !
mr.wescourt !
there he is !
did you kill her ?
can you tell us where you were that night ?
was she your girlfriend ?
can we get a statement ? we just want to ask ...
all right , come on .
you can go through the morgue loading docks .
are you sure ?
yes . come on .
all right , what was danni &apos;s favorite color ?
sage .
sage ?
she liked to look at the pottery barn catalog .
there &apos;s a lot of sage in there .
what was her favorite food ?
samosas .
least @-@ favorite food ?
shrimp . okay ?
sorry .
it wasn &apos;t a fling .
i loved her .
well , then , why not just leave your wife ?
i was trying to do the right thing for everyone .
oh , i @-@ i know how that sounds .
i just couldn &apos;t figure out an easy way to end things .
maybe there is no easy way .
maybe love always ends with someone getting hurt .
god , i hope not .
me , too . for your sake , anyway .
you still here ?
he really loved her , vince .
wouldn &apos;t be the first man to kill someone he loved .
and we don &apos;t have motive .
he &apos;s a married man with a high @-@ profile job .
motive was probably what it always is --
he wanted out , she threatened to expose him .
but she never even spoke his name to her friends .
and she encrypted files with articles about his case .
she wasn &apos;t trying to expose him .
she was protecting him .
and look .
he &apos;s got a trip to hawaii for a legal conference next month .
three days at the hyatt .
mm @-@ hmm , but the plane ticket is for a week .
where &apos;s he staying the rest of the time ?
check out her credit @-@ card records .
so that &apos;s who she was going on vacation with .
but why book a romantic getaway
with a mistress you &apos;re planning to kill ?
to make it look like you &apos;re not planning to kill her .
okay , say that &apos;s true .
why kill her this way ,
i mean , in the exact manner
of a case he just tried and won ?
i mean , if he wanted to get rid of her that badly ,
just shoot her or push her off a cliff or something .
well , maybe he &apos;s a sociopath who wanted to get caught .
it just doesn &apos;t feel right .
he lied about being in the apartment .
his alibi is full of holes .
his prints were at the crime scene .
it &apos;s a lot of evidence .
it &apos;s just ... too perfect .
i know what the evidence says .
i know what my gut says .
what &apos;s that ?
reasonable doubt .
this is the area between danni &apos;s apartment and the hotel .
it &apos;s like a mile .
9 / 10 of a mile , to be exact .
take about 12 minutes to walk .
so he easily could have parked in the lot ,
walked to danni &apos;s apartment , killed her ,
and headed back to the hotel to stay overnight .
nobody wants your gut to be right more than i do ,
but no matter how many times we go over it ,
he still looks guilty .
all right , well , what about the hair ?
can csru tell us exactly how much they found ?
we can &apos;t say exactly how much washed away before we got to it ,
but that it was there at all ...
he still looks guilty .
there &apos;s also the fingerprint .
that &apos;s where you got the print ?
it was on the underside of the handle ,
which is why they missed it in the first sweep ,
but it &apos;s a complete print .
also an exact match .
can you blow that up ?
we need to get back in that apartment .
guess who , according to a reliable source ,
is the definition of cool ?
did you give allie lipstick ?
what ?
her mother said something about her coming home with makeup on .
well , allie mentioned that a lot of girls in school
have started wearing makeup .
which her mother doesn &apos;t allow .
she mentioned that , and , um ,
i said that i agree with that rule .
but she is feeling the pressure just to fit in .
so you gave her lipstick .
lip gloss . just a little .
and i suggested that she try it on
as a way to broach the subject with you .
but if i &apos;ve overstepped my boundaries --
what was that for ?
for a week , i &apos;ve known something was bugging her ,
and she wouldn &apos;t talk to me .
it has been killing me , not knowing what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s hard to talk about .
i remember being the odd man out .
mm , i don &apos;t believe that .
well , believe it .
i was -- i think the technical term is &quot; weird . &quot;
i kind of like weird .
you &apos;re not wearing the lip gloss you gave my daughter , are you ?
no .
&apos;cause that would be a different kind of weird .
yeah .
i kind of ruined it .
just a little bit .
okay . okay , go .
reverse @-@ thread nuts are always tricky .
if you turn the wrench the wrong direction ,
you can crack the porcelain .
sometimes i forget you &apos;re a plumber &apos;s daughter .
you know , i never thought i &apos;d say this , but ...
thank you , pop .
this handle does not belong with that toilet .
they &apos;re two different brands .
maybe the landlord replaced it .
yeah , but the newer handles
are usually plastic or stainless steel .
this one &apos;s brass . look .
hmm . nice .
a little too nice for a landlord to spend money on .
what if that handle was somewhere else
when paul wescourt touched it ?
wouldn &apos;t take more than a wrench
for someone to relocate it here .
the print was planted .
i &apos;ll talk to the super ,
verify he didn &apos;t replace this handle .
if you &apos;re right --
i am . and so was paul wescourt .
he was set up .
we have new evidence in your husband &apos;s favor .
can you tell us where he is ?
you don &apos;t know ?
i assumed that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
the police are out looking for him right now .
what do you mean , the police ?
how can you not know ? this is all your fault !
slow down . tell us what happened .
i haven &apos;t seen him since you arrested him .
he just keeps leaving voicemail messages .
he &apos;s out of his mind .
all right , all right .
what is he saying in the messages ?
he &apos;s saying that -- that i --
that i don &apos;t deserve this , that he -- that he failed me .
i @-@ i called the police after this one .
this is the last time you &apos;ll hear from me .
you &apos;ll be better off if i put an end to this .
h @-@ he &apos;s gonna kill himself .
not if we can find him first .
maura ,
the suicides that come through your office --
can you figure out how and where they occur ?
most of them .
okay , can you use that information to figure out
a place where someone like wescourt might try it ?
well , it &apos;s not a straightforward formula .
was he on medications ?
did he have a history of depression ?
the woman he loves is dead . his marriage is over .
his career is ruined .
i think it &apos;s pretty safe to say the guy &apos;s depressed .
okay , i amplified the ambient noises
from the messages he left .
so far , i &apos;ve got what i think is a jet engine .
i &apos;m not gonna drag you through the humiliation of a trial .
it &apos;s time i put an end to this .
he &apos;s by an airport .
i @-@ i wish i could be a better man .
you deserve that .
that sounds like gunfire to me .
gunfire and jet engines .
i just want you to know how sorry i am .
what is that ?
this is all my fault . this is what i deserve .
what is that ?
could be car tires on steel grating , maybe a bridge .
there &apos;s a firing range on moon island .
the narrows bridge leads straight to it .
and it &apos;s adjacent to the flight path at logan .
remote bridge -- it &apos;s a perfect spot for a suicide .
you &apos;re not going alone .
well , korsak and frankie are at the courthouse .
then it &apos;s you and me .
that &apos;s his car .
maura , stay here . i don &apos;t want to spook him .
jane -- - no , i know this guy well enough to know
he &apos;s not bluffing .
be careful .
paul ?
paul ?
listen to me , okay ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
no , just -- just listen .
i know you were set up . and we can prove it .
so ?
please w -- wait . wait . wait .
okay , listen .
i @-@ i know that we said that there &apos;s no easy way
to end things , but y--
you can &apos;t do this , okay ? you can &apos;t quit like this .
i ruined my marriage .
danni &apos;s gone .
my life &apos;s over .
no . no , it isn &apos;t . okay , j--
just ... hang on a second , okay ?
let me come down there .
oh , jane , don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll stay over here , all right ?
we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll just talk from here .
okay ?
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not moving any f -- any further , all right ?
i know that you think that your life is over ,
and -- and -- and maybe i can &apos;t change your mind on that ,
but just -- please , for one second --
please , will you just think about danielle ?
danni .
i know you didn &apos;t kill her .
okay ? i --
i @-@ i think you loved her more than anything .
and i think that &apos;s why you --
you were so conflicted about what to do .
and that &apos;s why you cannot let whoever did this to her
get away with it , okay ?
come on .
paul , you said it yourself -- her killer is still out there .
look , i ...
i ca -- i can &apos;t bring danni back .
okay ? and -- and --
i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t give you any more nights
flipping through catalogues and -- and -- and indian food .
but -- but i can bring her killer to justice .
i can do that .
okay ? please -- please h @-@ help me do that .
doesn &apos;t she deserve that ?
come on .
no !
jane !
jane !
jane !
jane !
jane !
