toodle @-@ fucking @-@ oo
hey , no speeding . this is a party zone !
come on ! we can do it !
hey , janet jackson .
hi , mr. soprano !
where &apos;s meadow ?
l give up. ln the house ?
tony .
billy , thanks for calling .
as soon as l found out it was your mom &apos;s place .
o.d. friend says special k and ecstasy .
you fucking kidding me ?
your kid &apos;s all right .
she &apos;s a little drunk .
32.1 , repeat , you &apos;re breaking up .
529 , are you in pursuit of vehicle on 75 north ?
ln your grandmother &apos;s house .
lt wasn &apos;t my fault .
lf l had a quarter every time l heard that . . .
. . .l &apos;d have a private jet on 24 @-@ hour standby .
get in the car .
ln your grandmother &apos;s house .
now he &apos;s repeating himself .
just lucky l knew that cop . so he cut me a favor .
let me guess , he owes you money ?
what did she do ?
go upstairs .
no , l want to see the fight .
get your little ass up those stairs !
meadow !
we can talk about it in the morning .
get down here !
let her go to bed .
l want her to answer for herself ! she &apos;s drunk ! was she driving ?
l could &apos;ve taken ecstasy but l didn &apos;t !
don &apos;t puke on the floor !
you still up ? go to bed !
she &apos;s on ecstasy and you yell at me ?
get up there !
what did she say for herself ?
the usual shit . &quot; wasn &apos;t my fault . &quot;
there was designer drugs there , tony .
so , what did you say ?
l don &apos;t know. l yelled . what the fuck else am l gonna do ?
you sure you &apos;re gonna be all right , uncle rich ?
l want to walk .
see if l run into any of the old crowd .
thanks , doll .
motherfucker .
there has to be consequences .
what kind of parents would we be if we let her get away with this ?
typical ?
plenty of parents still crack the whip .
yeah , that &apos;s what they tell you .
l cannot wait until she goes off to college .
oh , right , so you can get empty nest syndrome . . .
. . .and go on wellbutrin like your sister .
as a parent today , you are over a barrel no matter what you do .
you take the car , you &apos;re a chauffeur .
ground her , you stay in and be a prison guard .
throw her out , social services returns her . . .
. . .and we face a judge . she &apos;s not 1.8 yet .
that &apos;s your solution ?
all l &apos;m saying , with the laws today , you can &apos;t restrain your kid physically .
she could sue you for child abuse .
there has to be consequences .
and there will be .
l hear you , okay ?
let &apos;s not overplay our hand. lf she knows we &apos;re powerless , we &apos;re fucked .
hey .
that guy wants to talk to you .
jesus . mother of christ ! richie .
so when did you get out ? how come nobody told me ?
that &apos;s funny . paulie walnuts told me he ran into you this morning .
honest to fucking god , nobody said a word .
just shut the fuck up .
you know , l did a lot of meditation in the can on this .
on what ?
you can &apos;t believe how crazy things . . . .
you ever meditate ?
me ? meditate ?
are you crazy ?
not as crazy as l used to be .
but still crazy enough to take an eye out .
what &apos;s going on here , rich ?
ten years . and not even a pleasant &quot; go fuck yourself &quot; from you l get .
you know , l always asked how you were doing .
hold on there . you .
how could you let my dear friend sit here with an empty cup ?
l &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
take it easy , kid .
bring this gentleman a veal @-@ parm sandwich .
and hurry the fuck up about it .
the other two stores doing as good as this ?
come on , you know , it &apos;s a grind .
that doesn &apos;t answer my question .
rich , l know you &apos;re a made guy , so l lose either way .
but l always respected you and your brother , jackie .
l &apos;m no victim here .
l &apos;m not some greaseball storeowner. l &apos;m sorry , richie .
l will not be shaken down .
this sucking up to tony soprano has done wonders for you .
l go away for a while. l come back , you &apos;re a tough guy .
don &apos;t do this .
do what ?
take what &apos;s owed to me ?
what &apos;s owed to you ?
l put you in action , beansie .
you got a bad memory , beansie .
veal parmigiana sandwich .
fuck you .
l &apos;ll be back every saturday , partner .
l don &apos;t fucking believe this .
l &apos;m being shaken down , for what ? tell me , what did l do ?
this is not right .
l &apos;m not gonna fucking lay down .
l &apos;ll step up .
won &apos;t lay down , huh ? you don &apos;t want to lay dawn ? you piece of shit !
all right , let &apos;s get her down here .
l guess .
where is the bride of frankenstein ?
she &apos;s still sleeping .
yeah , right . go wake her up .
l wake her up ?
l want to get this shit out of the way before l go out .
you guys are making too much of this .
l don &apos;t think we &apos;re making enough .
she was drunk .
her choice . there &apos;s a zuni saying :
&quot; for every 20 wrongs a child does , ignore 1.9 . &quot;
there &apos;s an old ltalian saying : &quot; you fuck up once , you lose two teeth . &quot;
that &apos;s what all this is about . ego and control .
l beg your pardon ?
no , don &apos;t try to make sense with her .
no , l want to understand this . go ahead , tell me .
you want to hold on to control over a young woman . . .
. . .whose entire biological determinism . . .
. . .is to achieve independent thought and behavior .
she &apos;s exercised her independence . . .
. . .but you want to penalize her because you don &apos;t like her choices .
go get a fucking permanent .
l &apos;m trying to watch tv !
well .
good morning. l &apos;m sorry , is it afternoon ?
mom , please .
please what ?
you &apos;d better have some answers .
yeah . that &apos;s right !
fine . you &apos;re punished .
for what ? l didn &apos;t do anything !
you did nothing ?
lt wasn &apos;t my fault !
lt &apos;s never your fault , meadow .
lt was gonna be me , hunter and the macaluso twins .
then steve shows up with adam and people from boonton !
so steve &apos;s just trying doorknobs till he hits the jackpot ?
no , hunter tells him .
now with the hunter .
and she &apos;s at home , blaming it on you. lt &apos;s an old game .
you try studying day and night to get into college .
we work hard . we deserved a night !
take it easy .
take it easy .
l &apos;m sorry you &apos;re under a lot of pressure. lt &apos;s still no excuse .
so who was this ecstasy guy ?
l just told you . adam .
l don &apos;t know him . he came with steve .
the steve l know ? the school kid you &apos;re always with ?
he &apos;s a flake . why do you think l stopped hanging with him ?
that &apos;s news to me you don &apos;t hang out with steve .
lt &apos;s painful to talk about , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna get punished .
look , you guys , l know what l did was not okay .
l &apos;ve been thinking about it a lot and really not feeling good about myself .
you should take away my discover card .
you better believe it !
that &apos;s right !
for two weeks .
three !
how do l buy gas ?
your allowance .
l spent my allowance . and l already owe mom .
the pashmina .
we can wait on that .

hey , fuck you .

jesus christ , how you doing ?
your brother , jackie , was like a fucking god .
a great leader . and l heard a lot about you .
yeah , well , l heard a lot about you .
that &apos;s why l &apos;m here .
what do you mean ?
out of respect for our friend here , l &apos;m gonna talk nice .
l ever hear you raise your hands to my niece again . . .
. . .next time you won &apos;t see my face .
you understand ?
who told you l put my hand on her ?
ls this kid getting jerky with me ?
look , kid , l shouldn &apos;t have to explain myself .
l &apos;m from the old school .
you want to raise your hands , give her your last name .
then it &apos;s not my business .
until then , keep your hands in your pockets .
we understand each other ?
now get out of here .
l want to talk to tony .
go ahead .
he &apos;s a good kid .
capable .
look , ton , this is the thing .
l want to get my shy business back .
l keep getting calls from jackie &apos;s customers--
where the fuck are you going ?
l &apos;ll talk to you later , richie .
what just happened ?
no more business talk with him directly .
you fucking with me ?
you can talk to him .
but not now .
and never here .
can you believe we drank a whole bottle of wine ?
thank god !
cheers .
cheers .
we &apos;re out of here .
okay .
richie broke a chair over his head .
you shitting me ?
hit him with a coffeepot too . broke his cheekbone .
prick. l talked to him yesterday . he &apos;s all sweetness and lights .
already this shit &apos;s getting old .
yo , bright eyes .
where you going ?
this isn &apos;t the bing , huh ?
fuck did l say ?
hey , how have you been ?
can &apos;t complain .
you look good .
where did your friends go ?
tell them to come back , join us .
no , they &apos;re leaving .
first time here . excellent veal .
we making small talk now ?
nice to see you .
yeah , you too .
toodle @-@ oo .
bye @-@ bye .
not a bad ass .
she had nice pipe @-@ fitter lips . no disrespect .
hey , what do l give a fuck ? l hardly know her .
you mean , you would take the lips over the tits ?
trust me , my boy . there &apos;s two things l &apos;m good at :
lt &apos;s pulling dents and spotting good blowjobs .
and that sweetie had world @-@ class blowjob lips .
am l right , skipper ? good or no ?
what the fuck do l know ? lt was a long time ago .
all right , she was good . all right ?
good ?
or great ?
why you busting my balls ? lt was a long time ago .
hey , l remember every blowjob l ever got .
you remember your first blowjob ?
yeah , of course .
how long did it take for the guy to come ?
l said , &quot; you remember your first blowjob ? &quot;
&quot; yeah . &quot; &quot; how long did it take for the guy to come ? &quot;
&quot; toodle @-@ fucking @-@ oo &quot; ?
what the fuck was that ?
l couldn &apos;t sleep from the embarrassment .
what was so wrong ? lt &apos;s an accepted form of goodbye .
that &apos;s not the way l talk with patients .
lt wasn &apos;t me. lt was someone else .
lt was jennifer .
for whatever reason , at that moment ,
you felt safer showing him jennifer .
what did you see at that table that made you want to hide &quot; doctor &quot; ?
who were you hiding from ?
l saw a patient that l never wanted to see again .
that &apos;s who l was hiding from . a patient .
when you say &quot; see &quot; . . .
. . .do you mean professionally or just plain &quot; see &quot; ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
there &apos;s a big difference .
lf it was just a matter of just plain old &quot; see &quot; . . .
. . .the cordial doctor would &apos;ve said , &quot; good night . &quot;
but , because he &apos;s someone you didn &apos;t want to see professionally . . .
. . .you abandoned the doctor fa鏰de and adopted the jennifer posture .
hence , &quot; toodle @-@ oo . &quot;
you &apos;re almost there , elliot , but not quite .
young girls are not accountable for their behavior .
l think &quot; toodle @-@ oo &quot; was the action of a ditsy young girl .
and l regressed into the girl thing to escape responsibility . . .
. . .for abandoning a patient .
he asked me for help .
look , l need you as a colleague to tell me that l did the right thing .
you gotta ask yourself why you became a psychiatrist .
lf it was to help people stop smoking or biting nails . . .
. . .then so be it . there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
another patient committed suicide because l was treating this man .
because l had to go on the lam .
treating patients from a motel room isn &apos;t optimum . . .
. . .but you were there for her , in phone contact .
lt would have been the same if you &apos;d been on vacation .
did you say &quot; lam &quot; ?
and lifting up into cobra .
and now rising up into downward facing dog .
coming back down into cobra .
and relaxing into child &apos;s pose .
richie .
janice . you know , l thought that was you .
&quot; parvati . &quot;
l changed my name to parvati in &apos; 78 .
l thought you lived in california now .
seattle , actually , last couple years .
so , how long you been . . . ?
out of jail ?
one week . that &apos;s where l picked up this yoga shit .
lt &apos;s working . you seem very supple .
l &apos;m doing a lot of stretching .
so you back now ?
my mom &apos;s at st. erasmus . a stroke .
sorry to hear that . tony didn &apos;t say anything about it .
guess we &apos;re all getting a little old .
only if that &apos;s our choice .
drag me all the way out here--
l walk through the food court , this kid spills fried rice on me .
take it easy . keep your voice down . let &apos;s talk .
yeah , let &apos;s . how would you feel ?
your crew evaporates , then you walk away from me like l got a disease .
l don &apos;t talk business . don &apos;t take it personal .
l &apos;m a government target .
why do you think we &apos;re meeting in a fucking mall ?
lt feels disrespectful . you know , that &apos;s all l &apos;m saying .
l &apos;m the guy who saved you from the hit parade .
when ? when did you ever step in for me ?
you forget ?
you and my brother stuck up feech lamanna &apos;s card game ?
feech was a made man .
lf it wasn &apos;t for me , you would &apos;ve got a vicious beating , to say the least .
you know l love you .
you &apos;re like my big brother . you &apos;ll be taken care of .
what was yours before you left will be yours again .
you just gotta give us some time .
jeez , anthony , you &apos;d do that for me ?
hey , fuck you .
what &apos;s mine is not yours to give me .
hey , prick , you reached out to me .
l said what l wanted to say .
well , we got a problem , kid ?
l &apos;m trying to get you to slow down .
things are different now . you gotta be extra , extra careful .
when do you know me not to be careful ?
when ?
you been out of the can 1.0 minutes , you shake down beansie for a piece .
do me a favor , back off . he &apos;s a good earner .
yeah , for you .
that &apos;s none of your fucking cazzi .
those joints are a cash business . they come in handy .
he &apos;s a sneaky cocksucker .
whatever , back off .
you taking the side of a civilian over me ?
christ , l &apos;m asking you to do me a favor .
do it if you want to. lf you don &apos;t , go fuck yourself .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
how &apos;s your sister ?
there &apos;s no need for that talk .
what ?
my sister .
janice . how &apos;s she doing ?
oh , l thought you were baiting me . you know . . . .
&quot; how &apos;s your sister ? &quot; &quot; fuck your mother . &quot;
see what she did ?
who ?
meadow .
that house is fucked !
thought you didn &apos;t swear .
what are you talking about ?
l &apos;m outraged . no , l am beyond outraged .
talk about disgrace ? disrespect for other people &apos;s property ?
lt &apos;s like a freaking shooting gallery .
lt smells of urine , there &apos;s puke all over the hardwood floors--
sounds like your place in venice .
she &apos;s been punished .
three weeks without a card .
oh , madonna , that &apos;s some heavy shit there !
janice . . . .
lf that was my child--
you got a lot of fucking balls , you know that ?
don &apos;t talk to me like that .
let &apos;s clear the air here .
you &apos;re a vishnu @-@ come @-@ lately , playing concerned .
who the fuck are you kidding ?
you &apos;re here to pick the frigging bones .
there &apos;s a lot l could say right now that l am not gonna say .
a lot of balls .
temper tantrums .
he hasn &apos;t changed one iota since we lived in newark . not one !
you &apos;re passing judgment on him , janice . on us as parents .
how we discipline our children is none of anybody &apos;s business .
you let that girl walk all over you , you &apos;ll regret it .
mother of god , janice ! are all of you sopranos the same ?
l ask you nicely to stay out of it , you pretend not to hear .
maybe you &apos;ll hear this .
mind your fucking business . keep your mouth shut when it comes to my kids !
maybe l &apos;ve stayed here too long .
the fall in the shower didn &apos;t affect your pre @-@ existing heart condition .
but you already knew that .
lt never hurts to be sure .
fucking bum hip .
what next does the man upstairs have in store for me ?
you &apos;re lucky it was a sprain .
the thing is , doc , l &apos;ve been feeling these , like , little fibrillations .
psychosomatic . you got out of jail on a medical .
lt &apos;s the mind @-@ body connection . your body &apos;s just pitching in to help .
hey !
there &apos;s my boy !
l was afraid you didn &apos;t get the message .
put a shirt on , l &apos;m getting a chubby .
doc , this is one of my dearest friends .
richie , this is the best heart man in the world , doug schreck .
mr. soprano oversold me. l &apos;m only the best in the western world .
fucking ball @-@ breaker .
doc , do me a favor ?
me and richie . . . .
yeah , no problem .
he &apos;s good . lets me use his doctor- patient privilege to meet people here .
fucking house arrest .
federal marshals so far up my ass , l can taste brylcreem .
jesus , you look good . how you feeling ?
better than some , not as bad as others .
l gotta meet tony at a mall , you here . what the fuck is happening ?
like the man said , &quot; may you live in interesting times . &quot;
you met with tony ?
lt &apos;s more like a fucking audience with the pope .
what are you gonna do ?
whatever you tell me .
you and your brother were always good boys .
you tell me this is the way it is , then so be it .
you tell me otherwise . . .
. . .l &apos;m yours , junior .
whatever , whoever .
you just say it .
once again , a big welcome home to our guest of honor .
richie was surprised by the changes in 1.0 years .
new jersey has a hockey team .
lt &apos;s interesting , meadowlands is the only nhl arena . . .
. . .where the penalty box is maximum @-@ security .
maximum @-@ security penalty box .
help me .
what the fuck ?
l was talking to paulie walnuts . . .
. . .who thought that richie had been in bosnia . . .
. . .where there &apos;s also a large muslim population .
that &apos;s it . out of here .
enough .
and now for all you youngsters with visions of tit @-@ fucking in your head . . .
. . .here are the bing girls ! come on !
hey .
welcome home .
wait till you open it. lt &apos;s all ones .

asshole !
janice ?
l &apos;m sorry , is the music too loud ?
oh , no , it &apos;s fine .
l just wanted to apologize . you know , about earlier .
no , l should be apologizing to you .
l was out of line .
you &apos;re right .
l never raised a child .
l was robbed of that when eugene took him back to montreal .
l &apos;m petitioning the state department . . .
. . .but they have me on their enemy radicals list , so . . . .
when was the last time you saw harpo ?
he changed his name to hal .
l &apos;m sorry , carm , can we not talk about him ?
look , l just want you to know that l was way out of line .
well , l &apos;m sorry too . really , l just feel terrible .
you know , you &apos;re family .
and family means a lot .
l just don &apos;t feel right about you leaving here .
l don &apos;t know .
l don &apos;t think tony wants me here .
where will you go ? the house is in no condition to move into , especially now .
l &apos;ll be all right .
no , l &apos;m sorry. l really can &apos;t let you leave .
really , l want you to stay .
okay .

richie , no ! richie , no !
jesus !

put it in , l &apos;ll pour the milk .
what did your parents say about saturday ?
the usual . nothing . they &apos;re afraid l &apos;ll go bulimic again .
mine just &quot; blah , blah , blah . &quot;
purge and they won &apos;t say anything .
when will they realize we &apos;re adults , responsible for ourselves ?
so we had a party at your grandmother &apos;s .
would they prefer we go to limelight ? hello !
lt &apos;s because they have no life . they focus on bullshit .
so , what did yours do ?
they took my discover card for three weeks .
that &apos;s nothing .
l know , it was my idea .
dicks .
so hypocritical too .
when you think how my dad makes a living .
oh , jeez ! what is this ?
why don &apos;t you ring for the nurse ?
never you mind !
that &apos;s their job .
l don &apos;t need them .
my daughter came all the way from seattle .
oh , jesus !
hello ?
she rang for you .
l did not .
mrs. soprano .
who are you ?
richie .
richie aprile .
but l thought you were dead .
no , hon , that was my brother , jackie .
oh , l &apos;m sorry .
how did he die , the poor baby ?
he had cancer .
me too .
shut that curtain , will ya ?
you know , l was in a private room .
my johnny would roll over in his grave if he saw this .
oh , they wheel people in and out , in and out . oh , go on !
so isn &apos;t parvati supposed to be here ?
l don &apos;t know who that is .
your daughter , parvati . janice .
oh , yeah , please . don &apos;t start with that name business .
she did it to shame me .
you &apos;ll have to have your tea without lemon .
richie .
you see the beautiful flowers he brought me ?
yeah , see ? your father has friends with class .
not like some people .
ma , he &apos;s not one of dad &apos;s friends . he &apos;s my friend .
you mean , he &apos;s your boyfriend ?
remember ? you used to yell at me . . .
. . .for beeping my horn when l came to pick up janice .
pimps beep !
you know , someday somebody &apos;s gonna wash out your mouth with soap , hon .
oh , yeah , who ? you ?
oh , l wish the lord would take me .
the man &apos;s come to visit you .
take it easy !
ls that how you talk to your mother ?
you lay the same trip on everybody who comes .
don &apos;t you have any shame ?
shame ?
oh , l got plenty of shame .
believe me .
you don &apos;t want to hear what l &apos;m ashamed of .
go ahead , ma . shoot your best shot .
never you mind .
just remember what we talked about last week .
ma , l &apos;m gonna go to the cafeteria for some coffee .
are you coming back ?
yes .
l bet you &apos;re very good to your mother .
she &apos;ll be better when l get her home .
does that mean you &apos;re sticking around ?
lf l don &apos;t , who &apos;ll take care of her ?
what about tony ?
long story . you haven &apos;t heard what happened ?
tony blames everyone else . . .
. . .for anything bad in life , including ma .
tony ? no .
trust me . nothing &apos;s ever his fault .
so , what &apos;s with the flowers , mr. candy stripe ?
l couldn &apos;t visit her empty @-@ handed .
oh .
you weren &apos;t at yoga .
l &apos;m very busy with my mother .
too busy for dinner ?
we weren &apos;t good together 20 years ago .
why do you think it &apos;s any different now ?
let &apos;s get to the point .
after getting to where l am , it &apos;d be ridiculous to decompensate now .
l am so not that person anymore .
lt works both ways .
you know , l don &apos;t think l &apos;d be interested in the same jan l knew .
so , what , you &apos;ve grown ?
well , you tell me .
did you ever think you &apos;d see richie aprile doing . . .
. . .downward facing dog ?
can she put more gook shit in here ?
lt &apos;s not that much .
soy milk , tofu , l hate all that shit !
yeah , me too .
shut up , you said you liked soy milk .
l lied . she was taking me to the video store .
l &apos;m happy aunt parvati &apos;s staying .
the one who thinks you &apos;re spoiled ?
lt wasn &apos;t my fault . how many fucking times l gotta say it ?
hey !
whoa !
don &apos;t look like you &apos;re gonna cry . you made your bed .
