i &apos;m very proud to welcome you
to the marriage of lena elizabeth adams
to stefanie marie foster .
she &apos;s gonna be devastated
when she finds out we aren &apos;t coming back .
i &apos;m not going to be selfish anymore , ok ? i promise .
what are you doing here ?
i need a ride .
good morning , mrs. adams foster .
good morning , mrs. adams foster .
no hyphen , right ? we agreed , yes ?

but how much do i love that we all have the same last names now .
mm @-@ hmm . i love it , i love it , i love it ...

your mom must be making breakfast .
oh , i love her in this moment right now ...
i love her very much .
does that mean we have to join them ?

do we have to ? please say no .
the only thing you have to do ...
yeah ?
is kiss me .
morning breath , that &apos;s not going to happen .
i don &apos;t care .
come here , woman .
i love it when you call me &quot; woman . &quot;
well , i thought it was just the most beautiful wedding i &apos;ve ever seen .
you know , stef &apos;s dad and i got married in las vegas ,
in one of those awful theme chapels .
good morning , darling . sit down and eat .
wow , you &apos;ve been busy , grandma .
well , you know , they don &apos;t tell you when you do a diy wedding
that you &apos;re gonna have to un @-@ diy it yourself .
i mean , look at all this stuff .
where &apos;s callie ?
she has guitar lessons sunday morning .
wow , ma ! did you even sleep last night ?
sleep is so over @-@ rated .
i wanted to make sure that
we got everything done before i fly out tonight .
you know , i mean , i don &apos;t want to leave you with any of this .
thank you .
that is so sweet .
i &apos;m loading up the glasses and the dishes now ,
i already got the tables in the suv .
you loaded the tables ?
well , jesus helped me .
you did ? good boy .
that &apos;s great ...
that &apos;s all i &apos;m doing .
it &apos;s lexi &apos;s last day before she leaves ,
and i &apos;m spending it with her .
um , no .
lexi &apos;s coming over and we &apos;re working on our english project .
and we &apos;re totally behind because every time she comes over here ,
she ends up hanging out with you .
but that &apos;s not due for like a month .
yeah , and lexi &apos;s going to be gone for a while .
we &apos;re not saving it until the last minute ,
we &apos;re supposed work on it all semester .
where &apos;s she going ?
to honduras to see her family .
wait , how &apos;s that going to work ?
their dad has a way , i guess .
when is she supposed to be back ?
um , two weeks .
the way you said it ...
i thought she was moving away forever .
god , no . i think i &apos;d die .
hey , ma . thank you so much for everything you &apos;ve done .
i can &apos;t believe you loaded the tables in the suv ...
because , unfortunately ...
hey !
why are all the tables in your suv ?
i thought i was supposed to pick &apos; em up and return them ?
i &apos;m sorry , my fault .
it &apos;s fine , but the glasses and the dishes ...
and the chairs .
and the chairs ... they have to go back after the glasses .
we could do the glasses first
but it makes more sense geographically
if we start with the chairs
and work our way around the loop ending with the glasses .
a word of advice to the newly married , we say yes .
it &apos;s so much easier .
you never do , so shut up .
all right , well we got tables to unload and reload ...
that means everybody . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
i just got dressed .
guys , i &apos;m so sorry , sorry .
mom , it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
i was just trying to help .
yes , and you were a very big help and we appreciate it.thank you
listen , i didn &apos;t want to say
anything yesterday &apos; cause the wedding and all , but ...
adoption ? really ?
i mean , i think jude and callie are great kids , i really do ,
but they &apos;ve only been here a little while ,
you don &apos;t really know what they have been through
and you &apos;ve got three other kids you need to take care of .
have you thought this through ?
yes , mom .
yep .
wyatt ...
i &apos;m not letting you in until you tell me what &apos;s going on .
come on , wyatt .
no .
i don &apos;t think i want to be harboring
a known fugitive unless i know why .
fine . can i please get in ?
i &apos;m not moving .
things just weren &apos;t working out , ok ?
i was probably gonna get sent to another foster home and i just ...
i can &apos;t do it anymore .
i want ... i need to be
in charge of my own life for once , you know ?
what do you mean , things weren &apos;t working out ?
you seemed pretty happy .
yeah ? yeah .
sure , i was .
it &apos;s just ...
did you do something ? or something ?
well , it &apos;s nothing illegal , no .
no , no , i mean like , like something bad .
maybe .
so , i didn &apos;t get to talk to callie last night ,
and i know that yesterday was kind of ...
weird , what happened and everything ,
and i just , you know ,
wanted to make sure you &apos;re cool .
no , you don &apos;t .
you just wanna know if i &apos;m gonna tell .
what ? no , that &apos;s ...
so , what ?
you think you &apos;re gonna be with my sister now ?
you can &apos;t be together . they won &apos;t adopt us .
well , we ...
we &apos;ll figure something out , you know .
we &apos;ll talk about it when she gets back from her guitar lesson .
you &apos;re no better than liam .
hey ! i &apos;m not liam .
i &apos;m nothing like liam .
i love callie .

you two can see yourselves out , can &apos;t you ?
they &apos;re gonna kill you .
they are not . shh ! come here and check this out .
they &apos;re going to love it and i know they are ,
because i love this bed so much ...
i love this bed like ...
like sleeping beauty loves her prince .
as a matter of fact ,
if sleeping beauty had had this bed ,
i don &apos;t think she would &apos;ve
even wanted that prince to wake her up .
back home in tampa i have this boyfriend ,
and , well , he &apos;s kind of a nimrod ,
but i &apos;m not gonna break up with him , you know why ?
because i love his bed .
here , check it out .
you can raise the feet up
or you can raise the head up if you wanna read .
yeah , there you go . you &apos;re doing it . all right .
ok , whoa ! hey cowboy ! ahh !
give me that .
whoops .
jack your own side up there , buddy .
that &apos;s better . yeah .
wouldn &apos;t it be better to
get rid of the nimrod and buy yourself a bed ?
you don &apos;t pull any punches , do you ?
you &apos;re just like my daughter .
ok , here we go . there he goes .
look , i &apos;m a taco .
look , i &apos;m a corpse .
can i have some time with my girlfriend now ?
no , we have to get this done , jesus .
leave us alone .
can &apos;t you take a break ?
what part of no don &apos;t you understand ?
lexi , come on .
um , i can use a few minutes .
ok , fine . we &apos;ll finish this later .
wait , mariana &apos;s right . we should probably keep working ,
but i &apos;ll come find you later ?
go on , it &apos;s fine .
girl , it &apos;s obviously not fine .
what &apos;s up ?
look , i &apos;m totally cool
with you dating jesus , really , it &apos;s just ...
every time you come over here ,
you always end up hanging out with him and , i don &apos;t know .
and i don &apos;t pay any attention to you . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;ll understand once you fall in love .
it &apos;s just what happens .
ok . so , i don &apos;t understand
because i &apos;ve never had a boyfriend before ?
you know what ? i could use a break .
i &apos;m going to get a soda . do you want one ?
演唱者 barrett strong
so , you actually believe that all that &apos;s real ?
that hole in the ground is where an alien spaceship went in ?
no , totally fake .
ok , but you think aliens are real .
one hundred percent .
no , i don &apos;t get it . you just admitted that all this is fake .
that &apos;s how you know it is real .
the government is going through
such lengths to make everything seem fake
to throw us off .
can we have two , please ?
right . i see , so ...
so , the fakeness itself is what makes it real ?
totally .
you &apos;re weird .
it &apos;s the best way to be .
do you believe in ghosts ?
mm @-@ hm .
and time travel ?
yeah , 100 percent .
ok , then why haven &apos;t the people
in the future made themselves known here today ?
because it &apos;s dangerous . they would mess with the future .
haven &apos;t you seen a movie , like , ever ?
all right , when you &apos;re a time traveler
you have to stay invisible ,
you have to disappear so that you don &apos;t wreak havoc on history .
you &apos;d be a really good time traveler .
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
i wreak havoc wherever i go .
well , if you could travel anywhere in time , where would you go ?
five years in the future .
five years ? that &apos;s it ?
yeah . i &apos;d be 21 , living on my own .
jude would be almost 18 .
we wouldn &apos;t have to worry about
foster families and cps and stuff .
what about jude ?
he &apos;s better off without me .
jude , what are you doing ? we &apos;re trying to work here .
everything ok ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
she ran away .
so no one konws anything .
ok , that &apos;s great .
when was the last time anyone saw her ? mariana ?
when we went to bed last night .
when i woke up this morning she was gone ,
but i figured she &apos;d already left for her guitar lesson .
i don &apos;t believe this .
we just told her we wanted to adopt her ,
is that what this is about ? did we freak her out ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
we &apos;re going to have to call her probation officer .
what if she comes back ?
maybe she just needed a day to herself .
with every single item she owns ? lena , come on .
won &apos;t calling her po just make things worse for her ?
she makes things worse for herself , lena .
and you know as well as i do that we have to follow procedure ...
yes , i know , you &apos;re right. you &apos;re right . go ahead .
hey , you ok ?
is callie going to go back to juvie ?
i don &apos;t know , honey .
i don &apos;t know , but i promise you that everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
i need to get in the bathroom ...

thank you .
of course , we will .
yes .

mom , i really don &apos;t need an &quot; i told you so &quot; talk right now .
hey , i did not come in here with a &quot; my god ... &quot;
that &apos;s good .
i just , i just wanted to say ,
you know , no matter what happens with callie ,
i certainly hope that ,
well , i hope you keep jude .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s a really , really special kid .
yeah ...
... he &apos;s amazing and so is his sister .
i just don &apos;t understand . i don &apos;t understand ...
i don &apos;t understand , mom .
shh ...
my love ...
teenagers are just ,
they &apos;re just as confusing as all get out , you know .
boy , raising you was like reading hieroglyphics blindfolded .
what ?
that &apos;s it .
i told your dad , &quot; i &apos;m shipping her off to nana . &quot;
you have a flight to catch , mom .
i can stay if you want , you know .
it &apos;s fine , mom . it &apos;s fine .
we &apos;ll be fine . we have plenty of help .
what happened to our bed , mom ?
happy wedding !
we loved our old bed , mom .
wait a minute ... wait a minute !
this one goes up and down .
so ...
are you gonna call them ?
stef and lena , i mean .
don &apos;t you think you should ...
no , i can &apos;t just ruin things for jude .
besides , i just finally did probation .
so , what &apos;s your plan ?
you coming all the way to indy with me ?
maybe .
would that be so bad ?
i &apos;m not sure how my grandparents are going to feel about
me just bringing someone to live with us .
right . yeah . sure ...
no , i just thought ...
i could come with you to indiana ,
and i could find a job ,
get my ged , find a place to live ...
i mean , how hard can it be ?
people way dumber than us do it every day .
i know your mom &apos;s not around anymore , but what about your dad ?
could you maybe stay with him ?
in prison ?
besides , even if he wasn &apos;t in prison , he doesn &apos;t want us .
how do you know that ?
i used to write to him .
he stopped writing a long time ago .
i just don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re so sure he just abandoned you .
it &apos;s like you automatically assume that
everybody gives up on you .
maybe he &apos;s ... maybe he &apos;s looking for you .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to make a bed on the floor .
you can sleep in the bed with me , fool .
you sure ?
yeah .
演唱者 vance joy

callie ?
callie ?
callie ?
callie !
callie !
i didn &apos;t know about it till she showed up at my house .
she was definitely going somewhere ,
and i figured she was better off with me
than on the streets alone .
like she is now ?
why ? w--why would she even leave to begin with ?
she said things weren &apos;t working out .
how she &apos;s probably getting sent to another foster home .
what ? what could she possibly mean by that ?
we just told her we wanted to adopt her .
stay here . gentlemen , please ...
hey , bud ... i know you &apos;re worried . i get it .
but ... they found her , right ?
so you &apos;re going to school today
and when you get home , she &apos;ll be here before you know it .
eat up .
i &apos;m not eating eggs anymore .
why not ?
chickens are treated really badly . like , awful .
like a thousand of them crammed in a shoebox or something .
well , i think these are cage @-@ free .
more for me .
would it be ok if i had cereal ?
yeah , sure . uh , cereal , cereal ...
ok . b , you should eat something .
dad , no ham .
why not ?
i mean , it &apos;s fine for me ,
but mariana won &apos;t eat it because of the pigs ,
and jude doesn &apos;t like it .
jesus , you like ham ?
ham &apos;s good .
i &apos;m going to need two sandwiches ,
otherwise i &apos;m starving to death .

i mean , it &apos;s kinda fattening .
but that &apos;s cool .

so , um ...
do you think she &apos;s back together with wyatt ?
i mean , do you think they &apos;re a couple again ?
did she say anything to you ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m pretty sure they broke up a month ago .
and she didn &apos;t say anything to you ?
i just , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t get how she could just ...
take off .
i know .
i was kind of starting to feel like i had a sister .

thanks .
hey , you got any change ?
do you ?
mariana . you got a sec ?
so , you &apos;re gonna need a new partner for your gatsby project .
i was thinking you could ask abby
since she doesn &apos;t have a partner ...
but i &apos;m doing it with lexi .
um , i don &apos;t think ... lexi &apos;s not coming back to school .
they &apos;re moving . she didn &apos;t tell you ?
you forgot to put down your phone number .
yeah , i kinda don &apos;t have one right now .
well , how am i supposed to get in touch with you ?
why , i just figured i could stop back in .
and lismore street ? where &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the other side of town .
oh . ok .
i &apos;ll just need to see an id .
you didn &apos;t fill any of this out .
i don &apos;t have an id .
you can &apos;t get a job without an id ,
and i &apos;ve lived here my entire life ,
i &apos;ve never heard of lismore street .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t get a place to live without a job ,
you can &apos;t get a job without a place to live .
uh , sweetheart ...
i have a daughter and
if she were out on the streets on her own ...
i &apos;d want someone to tell her to go home .
thanks .
just say it .
say what ?
what you &apos;re thinking .
how do you know what i &apos;m thinking ?
&apos;cause i know you .
well , if you know me , i shouldn &apos;t have to say it .
so just drop it .
but you want to . you want to say , &quot; i told you so , &quot;
&quot; i was right . &quot;
&quot; i should &apos;ve called the police as soon as wyatt called us ,
but i let you talk me out of it ,
and if we had done what i wanted to do ,
then callie would be safe right now . &quot;
yes , that &apos;s exactly what i want to say , because it &apos;s true .
i know that you think i am impulsive sometimes .
i know you think i rush into things without thinking about ...
like ana &apos;s house .
yes , like ana &apos;s house .
yeah , but sometimes i am right .
obviously , sometimes you are right .
obviously .
are we just gonna keep driving around in circles ?
shouldn &apos;t we stop , maybe get a map , make a plan ...
there &apos;s not a mark on a map that
says &quot; callie is here , &quot; ok ? so , this is the plan .
all right ? this is the plan . we drive , we look for her .
this is the plan . this is all i &apos;ve got .
you know what else i was right about ?
should &apos;ve returned the damn glass first before the place closed !
you &apos;re just going to leave them there ? we have to pay for those !
yes , we &apos;re just going to leave them there .
feel better ?
no .
what &apos;s going on ?
mariana did this for us .
a going away present . to both of you .
she &apos;s only going away for a couple weeks .
演唱者 madi diaz
we &apos;re not coming back .
what ... what ?
hold on . hold on . what do you mean ?
they told me this morning .
i was gonna call you guys , but i was afraid
i wouldn &apos;t be able to get on the plane if i saw you .
why are they doing this ?
well , my dad &apos;s job ...
figured out he wasn &apos;t here legally and they fired him .
and i guess that was the final straw , you know ?
i think they &apos;re just ...
tired of being afraid all the time .
oh , my god .
this sucks .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
and i &apos;m gonna figure out a way to come back .
like , maybe for college or something .
i can get a student visa .
but i don &apos;t want you to wait for me or anything , ok ?
lexi ...
no , no .
i &apos;m serious .
don &apos;t say anything you don &apos;t mean , ok ?
well , i mean this : i love you .
if i have to wait a while till i &apos;m gonna be with you again ...
well , then that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna wait for you .
of course . don &apos;t worry about it .
stef , it &apos;s fine .
all right . yeah . bye .
what &apos;s going on , dad ?
is she still with wyatt ? did they find her ?
she took off again .
you know who i am , lena ,
and i know that it &apos;s frustrating as hell for you sometimes .
same here .
we &apos;re so different it &apos;s baffling to me sometimes .
but i think that &apos;s why we work , you know ?
we balance each other out .
usually , at least one of us is right .
well , the sad thing is this time i think we were both wrong .
i think we were both wrong about callie .
ever since we found out she was gone ,
i &apos;ve been racking my brain trying to figure out
why the hell would callie leave .
and for a minute there , i thought ...
she was with wyatt and she must still be into him .
then she took off on her own .
and i realized that ,
no , she didn &apos;t run away with wyatt .
she ran away from me .
i kissed her and ...
she ran away .
i completely screwed this up .
i &apos;m really , really sorry .
she didn &apos;t leave because of you .
she left because of me .
i told her that she was selfish
and that she ruined everything for me .
so she left .
it &apos;s not your fault , jude .
ok ? it &apos;s not your fault .
