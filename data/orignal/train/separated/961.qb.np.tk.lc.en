&lt; i &gt; lynette made excuses . &lt; / i &gt;
the restaurant closed a half hour ago .
we &apos;re doing inventory .
&lt; i &gt; carlos made a friend ... &lt; / i &gt;
nothing better than family .
&lt; i &gt; and edie made a pass ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; victor popped the question ... &lt; / i &gt;
will you marry me ?
&lt; i &gt; susan let mike down ... &lt; / i &gt;
i love you .
you love him a little bit more .
&lt; i &gt; and ian ... &lt; / i &gt;
good @-@ bye , susan .
&lt; i &gt; ... let susan go . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it can happen to anyone . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; an old woman &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; hears suspicious footsteps as she walks down the street . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a businessman sees a reflection in his car window . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a shop owner feels a blade press against his back . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and , in that instant , an ordinary person &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; is transformed into a victim . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and a world that seemed so safe &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; is suddenly filled with danger . &lt; / i &gt;
so this little ear @-@ shaped pasta is called ...
orecchiette . and the cubes of bacon are pancetta .
thank god for italian .
you can charge way more for orecchiette with pancetta ,
than you &apos;d ever get for bacon and little ears .
thank you .
this is nice .
doesn &apos;t need more garlic ?
no , i mean ... everything .
the food , the wine ... you .
i swear , there are times this is all
that gets me through my day .
knowing , at the end of it , i get to steal this little half hour
where i &apos;m not a mom or a wife
or a pizza slave .
i &apos;m just a tired lady
with a nice man who cooks for her .
well , it &apos;s the highlight of my day , too .
sorry , guys . we &apos;re closed .
yeah , we know . put your cell phones on the table .
oh , crap .
get in there ! don &apos;t make any noise !
oh , my god .
oh , my god . they locked us in here ,
and it &apos;s 42 degrees .
we &apos;re gonna freeze to death .
listen , don &apos;t panic .
i &apos;m sure when you don &apos;t come home .
tom will come looking for you .
no , he won &apos;t , he takes a pain pill at ten .
he &apos;s probably already asleep . jeez .
how are we gonna make it through the night in here ?
&lt; i &gt; yes , in the moment it takes to bolt a freezer door , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ordinary people can become victims . &lt; / i &gt;
better ?
&lt; i &gt; and a world that seemed so safe ... &lt; / i &gt;
yeah , that helps .
&lt; i &gt; ... is suddenly filled with danger . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; at the exact same moment &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; his wife was being locked in a freezer , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; tom scavo was having a nightmare &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; about monsters trying to destroy his home . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but it wasn &apos;t until he woke up the next morning &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that his real nightmare began . &lt; / i &gt;
you awake ?
yeah .
did you sleep at all ?
a little . thanks for not letting me freeze last night .
you kidding me , you &apos;re the one who kept me warm .
you don &apos;t have a fever , do you ?
no , that &apos;s just me .
tom &apos;s always kicking the covers off the bed .
he calls me his little blonde furnace .
he &apos;s a lucky guy .
lynette !
tom ! in here !
oh , thank god !
we were robbed !
i don &apos;t care about that . are you ok ? were you hurt ?
no , i &apos;m fine . no , no , i &apos;m just cold .
i was so worried about you ,
if you knew the places that my mind has been .
i &apos;m sorry . i would have called ,
but they took our cell phones
before they locked us in .
us ?
i can &apos;t believe one dress could cost so much .
i want to look fabulous when victor is elected mayor .
isn &apos;t it bad luck to buy a dress for a victory party
before the election ?
vern , focus !
it &apos;s never bad luck when i look fabulous .
oh , hi . don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m here now .
your meter just expired .
you might want to put another quarter in .
oh , no . i &apos;m just gonna say bye to my friend , then i &apos;m gone .
this whole thing is crazy . i go on one gay cruise ,
and find you engaged to a politician .
oh , vern , i can &apos;t wait for you to meet him .
he &apos;s everything i &apos;ve ever wanted in a man .
sensitive and kind ...
and buys you $ 3,000 dresses .
buys me $ 3,000 dresses !
he &apos;s totally fine with you being high maintenance nightmare .
oh , my god , that &apos;s the best part .
he lets me be me .
all right , i gotta get going . see you later .
what are you doing ? i told you i was leaving . stop writing !
but you weren &apos;t leaving . you were flapping your gums .
give me a break ! i was standing there .
you could &apos;ve said something .
i told you to put a quarter in .
spoiled bitch .
you can &apos;t talk to me like that !
forty dollars ? ! think i &apos;m going to pay that ?
no , i &apos;m guessing it &apos;d be
the sap that bought you the $ 3,000 dress .
hey , carlos ! wait !
look , there &apos;s some crazy rumor going around
that mike moved .
it &apos;s true . he went on a little trip , then he &apos;s heading back east .
oh , my god . where is he now ?
look , i know that i &apos;ve put mike through the wringer .
that &apos;s why i have to talk to him , to make it right .
he &apos;s not answering his cell phone .
he turned it off .
said he wanted to clear his head .
carlos , tell me where to find him !
i &apos;m sorry , susan .
you know what they say , &quot; bros before hos . &quot;
&quot; they &quot; say it , i don &apos;t .
come on . just for my peace of mind.i have to know he &apos;s ok .
i don &apos;t know ...
what am i gonna do ?
go hunt him down ? i have a daughter .
i have responsibilities .
ok .
he hiked to the hot springs at pinewood valley state forest .
ok , julie , i &apos;m out of here . here &apos;s 40 bucks on the counter .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
yes , if i don &apos;t find mike before he &apos;s off that mountain ,
i won &apos;t see him again .
ok , what you &apos;re doing is nauseatingly romantic ,
but how do you know he wants to see you ?
after the &quot; i choose ian &quot; thing ?
that &apos;s why i have to go .
i have to make amends
and heal his broken heart .
ok , what if his devastation has turned to anger ,
and he &apos;s burning pictures of you in his fire ?
well , what else can i do ?
i love him . i have to go .
then go .
strike three ! you &apos;re out of there !
again ? how are you beating me ?
you got someone in there greasing the ball for you ?
hey , come on , travers , you can take him !
go for the soft underbelly !
soft ? what are you talking about ? i &apos;m all muscle .
travers , feel that bicep .
mom &apos;s is harder .
oh , well thank you , sweetheart .
fine , i can take a hint . i need a little exercise .
so how about we go to the batting cages and hit a few ?
cool !
wait , whoa , whoa , whoa .
we &apos;re going to the movies .
how about batting cages on saturday ?
sounds great .
yeah , we &apos;ll get to find out who hits the ball harder .
you or mom .
you are so going down . come here .
hey , who the hell is that ?
hello , edie .
uh , travers .
it &apos;s your dad .
kenya was amazing .
and being part of doctors without borders was rewarding .
but i can &apos;t do it again . not with the time commitment .
i &apos;m gonna have to wait until this little guy &apos;s in college .
so when are you taking travers home ?
not till tomorrow .
i &apos;m speaking at a conference in hilldale this afternoon .
and if you &apos;re hungry , i &apos;m buying you breakfast .
that &apos;d be great !
all right .
i &apos;ll help you get dressed .
you know , um , if you want to take a couple days and chill ,
edie and i would be happy to keep looking after travers .
oh , thanks , but we should probably get back home .
right .
the thing is ,
we made plans to take him to the batting cage on saturday .
oh , sorry .
well , maybe you can take him the next time he visits .
yeah .
and when do you think that &apos;ll be ?
i don &apos;t know . um , i &apos;ll have to check my schedule .
i don &apos;t mean to sound pushy . it &apos;s just , the three of us ,
we &apos;ve been having a lot of fun together .
well , look at the bright side ,
you &apos;ll have a lot more time alone with edie .
yeah , that is good .
officer , i cued it up to the clearest shot of the guy .
thank god .
you made me spring for that surveillance camera .
i wanted to spend money on a pinball machine .
son of a bitch !
i think these are the same guys
that hit the couple of diners in mount vernon .
you mind if i rewind ?
no .
i wanna see the exact time they came in .
oh , whoops . overshot it a little .
i was doing receipts
and rick surprised me with this great idea for the menu .
what are they called ?
orecchiette . it means little ...
i know what it means .
and he makes them with pancetta and garlic and olive oil .
it &apos;s really , really good .
it &apos;s gonna be our special tonight .
the door was unlocked ?
you need to be more careful .
the two of you were just asking for trouble .
yeah , i guess we were .
quiet , quiet ! they &apos;re about to announce .
valley ridge is too close to call .
however , we &apos;re now producting a winner in fairview .
it &apos;s victor lang by ten percent .
speech ! speech ! speech !
thanks , i couldn &apos;t have done it without any of you .
i &apos;d especially like to thank my beautiful fiance , gabrielle .
i will as soon as the feeling returns to my lower back .
sir , the mayor &apos;s on the phone .
sounds like he wants to concede .
gabrielle ! congratulations !
thank you .
your husband runs a great campaign .
we &apos;re so excited for victor .
what a day , huh ?
well , it is ending a lot better than it started .
what happened ?
this morning i got in a fight with a parking cop over a ticket .
the guy was a total jerk .
your days of dealing with that crap are over .
what do you mean ?
mayor johnson &apos;s wife , sydney ...
she &apos;s been collecting parking tickets
like bubble gum cards for years .
just gives &apos; em to her husband . they disappear .
keep talking .
honey , you are no longer one of the little people .
forget jury duty , speeding tickets ...
you rule this town now .
well , he conceded . i &apos;m the mayor .
you ready to be the mayor &apos;s wife ?
am i ever .
knock , knock .
hey . where &apos;s travers ?
his dad &apos;s helping him pack .
god , i &apos;m gonna miss that little guy .
it &apos;s been so much fun .
yeah . it was .
aw , you &apos;re gonna miss him , too , aren &apos;t you ?
i know what would cheer us up .
a weekend getaway , just the two of us . how &apos;s that sound ?
actually , i &apos;m busy this weekend .
oh , really ? i thought we had plans to go to the batting cage .
oh , yeah , but that was gonna take a couple hours .
i &apos;m swamped with work .
since when ?
you spend every day hanging out with me and travers .
exactly , i &apos;ve been putting off work
so that i could be there to help you with him .
now it &apos;s time to buckle down .
so what does that mean for you and me ?
we &apos;re still gonna see each other .
look , i was thinking ,
for your birthday we would go to that new oyster bar .
my birthday &apos;s two weeks from now .
yeah . it &apos;ll be my treat .
great . looking forward to it for the next 14 days .
hey , don &apos;t let travers leave without saying good @-@ bye to me .
i wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
i know how much he means to you .
hi , there .
can i get a map to the hot springs ?
i &apos;m gonna hike up there .
no problem . you got gear ?
yep .
that &apos;s not gear .
why not ?
it &apos;s tiny , ma &apos;am . and pink .
well , it &apos;s my daughter &apos;s . the whole junior class has them .
does the junior class have compasses , too ?
trail shoes ? tents ?
why would i need a tent ?
it &apos;s a two day hike to reach the springs .
two days ?
can &apos;t i just drive part of the way and hike from there ?
that &apos;s not really how nature works , ma &apos;am .
there are trails , not roads .
well , maybe i am a little unprepared ,
but it &apos;ll be fine . i work out .
i have quads of steel .
i &apos;m sorry , i just can &apos;t let you go up there ...
can &apos;t ? there &apos;s no &quot; can &apos;t &quot; in love !
there &apos;s a man on that mountain
that i intend to spend rest of my life with .
nothing is gonna keep me from him !
not fate , not destiny and definitely not you !
to finish my thought , ma &apos;am .
i can &apos;t let you go up there alone . you &apos;ll need a guide .
cool . how do i get one of those ?
toni , i got a hiker for ya !
this is toni . and those are quads of steel .
thanks for suggesting we do this .
i &apos;ve always wanted to try this place .
you &apos;ve been working for me over a month ,
and i figured it was time we got acquainted .
so much i don &apos;t know about you .
i &apos;ll be happy to fill in the blanks .
what would you like to know ?
well , for starters ...
are you sleeping with my wife ?
what ? no , tom , of course not .
so you &apos;re just hoping to sleep with her ?
if this is about the video ,
i swear , i was just trying out a new recipe ...
don &apos;t give me the recipe line . i am not an idiot .
the truth is ,
lynette and i have been going through sort of a rough patch .
yeah , she told me about that .
and then you came along and wham , it &apos;s the perfect storm .
you &apos;re young , good looking , sensitive .
way more fun than five screaming kids
and a cranky , invalid husband .
tom , seriously , nothing has happened .
and nothing is going to . because you are gonna quit .
quit ? no , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
you want me gone , fire me .
oh , you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
have lynette fight for you ,
while i &apos;m the jealous jerk who can &apos;t trust his wife .
no , you have to quit .
i &apos;m staying as long as lynette wants me there .
and , make no mistake , she wants me there .
buddy , you &apos;re not thinking this thing through .
because lynette will never leave her family .
so the best that , i mean the very best
you can hope for is to catch her at a weak moment ,
and leave a wound in her marriage
that will take years to heal .
but it will heal .
because i will stand by her and i will love her
just as hard as she hates herself for what she did .
you still feel like sticking around ?
can i get you some more bread ?
no , i think i &apos;ve had just about enough .
i mean ,
the doctor said that mike might never come out of the coma .
then when he did , he didn &apos;t even remember me .
do you need to rest a second ? you sound winded .
no , i &apos;m invigorated .
this fresh mountain air is ...
a little help ?
so , anyway , the whole situation with mike ,
it just seemed hopeless .
that &apos;s when i decided to take a chance with ian .
ian is the british guy whose heart you crushed ?
yeah . what was i supposed to do ,
wait forever for mike ?
no , seriously , i was asking .
what would you have done ?
i would have waited for him .
well , clearly you were not paying attention .
i did go back to mike the second he woke up ,
and he had totally forgotten me !
but none of that matters anymore , because ...
bug .
you know , the bugs can &apos;t get in
if you keep your mouth shut .
travers ?
i have someone who wants to meet you .
a puppy !
yeah , you wanna hold him ?
he &apos;s awesome ! are you gonna keep him ?
no , he &apos;s not mine . he &apos;s yours .
no way !
oh , way !
i just rescued him from the pound .
so what are you gonna call him ?
fenway . like fenway park .
that is so cute .
everybody back home is gonna be so jealous .
but , mom , i can &apos;t take him home .
dad &apos;s allergic .
that &apos;s right . shoot .
i &apos;m gonna have to take poor little fenway back to the pound .
no ! why can &apos;t i keep him here ?
well , you don &apos;t visit here very often .
and i can &apos;t take care of a dog all by myself .
well , i don &apos;t know what else to do .
why can &apos;t i just visit you more ?
hey , that &apos;s a thought . and carlos would love it , too .
of course , i don &apos;t know
how your father will feel about joint custody .
i &apos;ll talk to him . i &apos;ll tell him i want it .
really ? well , that would be great .
but you better make sure that
he knows that it was all your idea , ok ?
we &apos;re three hours from the hot springs .
so if we get an early start tomorrow ,
we should be there by lunch .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a face mask . it &apos;s lavender and honey . you want some ?
honey , huh ?
you &apos;re in the middle of the woods
getting ready to smear your face with bear food ?
well , i wanted to look nice for mike .
lord knows i don &apos;t want to hear you talk about this anymore ,
but ...
what exactly do you think is gonna happen
with you and this guy ?
well , i &apos;m going to apologize
and then i &apos;m gonna tell him that i made a huge mistake .
no , no , no . after that .
say he accepts your apology , you get back together ,
and then what happens ?
you know , after the novelty wears off .
well , then we &apos;ll just be happy .
ok . i know it &apos;s dark , but i can see you .
look , after hearing your whole history with mike ,
it doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure out the problem .
what is it ?
you .
you don &apos;t want to be happy . you &apos;re a drama junkie .
when there is no drama , you create it .
you sleep with your ex @-@ husband ,
you cheat on a coma victim ,
and now you &apos;re hiking up a mountain
after a guy who has no idea you &apos;re coming !
who knows ? maybe this guy will take you back .
but once the dust settles , you &apos;ll kick up some more ,
because you don &apos;t know how to just be happy .
you don &apos;t even know me . how dare you talk to me like that .
oh , so dramatic . i &apos;m gonna turn in now .
all right , sunshine , let &apos;s get moving .
你把我的装备带下山去 苏珊
what are you looking at ?
my city . it &apos;s like i &apos;m seeing it for the first time .
it looks different
now that i &apos;m first lady of fairview .
you didn &apos;t just call yourself &quot; first lady of fairview . &quot;
well , well , well . who do we have here ?
wouldn &apos;t you love to rub his nose in your new power ?
vern , you &apos;re just awful .
and as it happens , so am i.
gabby , come on . i was just joking .
hey , lady , that &apos;s a hydrant . you can &apos;t park there .
really ? because i just did .
you again .
gabby ...
just stand back and enjoy the carnage .
thank you . now , what you &apos;re about to see may astound you .
you know , i could give you another ticket for littering .
you could try , but you might not want to .
see , i &apos;m engaged to victor lang .
ring a bell ? the mayor ? your new boss ?
i don &apos;t follow politics .
let me know when the carnage begins
so i can shield my eyes .
listen , buddy ! you &apos;re not getting it !
you answer to me now !
i could have you fired !
you can &apos;t do nothing !
i can do whatever i want !
in fact , my first official act of business
as mayoress of fairview ...
is to declare today &quot; free parking day ! &quot;
hey , knock that off . hey !
free parking !
give me that !
give me that
ow ! you &apos;re hurting me !
oh , you know what that sound is , fat boy ?
the sound of your career circling the bowl .
yeah , you are gonna find out what happens
when you screw with the first lady of fairview .
ok , north . i need north .
moss grows on the north side of trees , so ...
what ?
damn it . stupid mossy trees .
dad !
hey , buddy !
how &apos;re you doing ?
good . can i ask you a question ?
sure . you can ask me anything .
how would you feel about joint custody ?
you bought him a puppy ?
no , i bought myself a puppy .
how was i to know that he &apos;d get so attached ?
don &apos;t lie to me , edie .
you were trying to manipulate him .
what , would it be so terrible to have joint custody ?
in case you forgot , i am his mother .
two weeks out of the year . and that &apos;s the way you wanted it !
well , i &apos;ve changed my mind .
oh , damn it , edie ! we had an agreement !
it wasn &apos;t official .
and there isn &apos;t a judge in this world
that would keep a mother from her child .
hey , travers . what &apos;s going on ?
mom and dad are fighting .
you wanna go watch tv at my house ?
ok .
i &apos;ll see you there in a sec , buddy .
if you haul me into court ,
so help me , i will destroy you .
you threaten me again and i will go for full custody ,
you son of a bitch .
so what is going on ?
edie has lost her mind .
for eight years ,
she &apos;s been happy to see him two weeks a year .
now , out of the blue , she &apos;s gotta have joint custody .
really ?
yeah ! how &apos;s that supposed to work ?
we live four hours away .
what &apos;s gonna do , go to two different schools ?
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , man . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , thanks .
you know , i just don &apos;t get it .
edie &apos;s been perfectly happy with our arrangement .
what the hell &apos;s gotten into her ?
well , thanks .
good night .
come again .
there . hey . i made you an espresso .
great .
you ok ?
you &apos;ve been so quiet all night .
i had lunch with tom today .
that &apos;s funny . he didn &apos;t mention it .
he asked if i was sleeping with you .
what ?
i am so sorry . oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
that paranoid idiot ! you know , i knew it .
i knew when we were watching the surveillance tapes .
he would completely misinterpret it .
did he ?
did he what ?
did he misinterpret it ?
or did he just see what is obvious ,
that you and i can &apos;t admit ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
there &apos;s nothing to admit .
lynette , how long are we going to kid ourselves ?
i have feelings for you .
i know you feel something for me .
stop ! don &apos;t say it ! you cannot say these things !
we both know , it &apos;s true . we &apos;ve been flirting since we met .
yes , flirting . that &apos;s it !
it &apos;s what married people do ,
because we know there &apos;s a line you don &apos;t cross .
and maybe i &apos;ve gotten close to that line .
maybe i &apos;ve enjoyed getting close to that line ,
but i have never once crossed it .
look , i know i don &apos;t have much to offer ...
and i have nothing to offer . i am taken !
great , great . now ... now what , you &apos;re mad at me ?
yeah , i &apos;m mad !
i am mad because i loved our nights together !
it made me feel sexy and happy
and god , how i needed that .
and now it &apos;s over .
you ruined it !
you can &apos;t work here anymore .
you &apos;re gonna fire me ?
oh , jeez . what choice do i have ?
lynette , lynette , please ...
don &apos;t touch me .
you have to go now , please . go .
you have to go now . go on . go .
her name is susan mayer . she &apos;s never hiked before .
now , this is the last place i saw her ,
but honestly , she could be anywhere .
just checking back in . name &apos;s delfino .
delfino . great , you &apos;re all set .
you sure she &apos;s lost ?
of course i &apos;m sure !
she &apos;s a dippy brunette from the suburbs !
she didn &apos;t bring a compass , she brought makeup .
wait , is she the one looking for the guy at the hot springs ?
yep , that &apos;s her .
now let &apos;s go find her before she falls off a cliff .
the woman is a total klutz !
yeah , i hear you . all right , we &apos;ll split up .
i &apos;ll take the north of the river here . you look down in here .
excuse me .
this klutz , could you tell me her name ?
hey , mike , um ...
listen , i know your cell phone &apos;s off , but ...
i wanted you to know that
i followed you up to the hot springs and ...
... now i &apos;m lost .
you know , on the off chance that
i get devoured by a mountain lion ...
i just wanted you to know that i love you .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
and i don &apos;t want any more drama .
and if you take me back ,
i promise there won &apos;t be .
unless i get eaten by a lion .
that &apos;ll be dramatic ,
but it won &apos;t be my fault .
anyway , um ...
i hope it &apos;s not too late ,
but if it is , i just ...
i just want you to know that i &apos;m so , so ...
... sorry .
here she is , sir .
no charges , no press , it never happened .
hi , honey .
you look handsome in a tux .
jerome , give us the room , please .
all right , look , i know you &apos;re mad .
but wait till you hear what that jerk did to me .
gabby , shut up .
are you familiar with the quote ,
&quot; for the one to whom much has been entrusted , &quot;
&quot; even more will be demanded ? &quot;
um ... doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
it &apos;s from the bible ...
that explains it .
this is not a joke !
i have been elected mayor .
certain things are expected of me !
one in particular is that
my future wife not assault city employees !
he was mean ! he deserved ...
i don &apos;t care !
your behavior reflects on me .
i can &apos;t do my job if you &apos;re constantly humiliating me .
constantly ? aside from today , give me one example .
ok , how about jumping into my arms
like a ten @-@ year @-@ old at the election party ?
i was just joking around , being me .
i thought you liked that .
i do , in private .
in public , you have to act like a grown @-@ up .
ok . i &apos;m sorry i disappointed you .
it won &apos;t happen again .
i had better get dressed .
i don &apos;t want to be late to the victory party .

that &apos;s what i was trying to tell you .
the meter man grabbed my arm and twisted it .

it &apos;s not as bad as it looks .
still , he shouldn &apos;t have done that .
you &apos;re home early .
it was kind of dead tonight . hi . oh , sorry .
by the way , we are gonna need to find a new chef .
rick gave notice .

he got a better offer from some place across town .
that &apos;s too bad .

i missed you , too .
hey , edie .
well , hello , stranger .
come on in .
so what &apos;s up ?
nothing much .
i hear you &apos;re going for joint custody of travers .
yep . i hired a lawyer , and he is a real shark .
you &apos;re not messing around , huh ?
i think it &apos;s important that travers has his mother in his life .
of course , he &apos;ll probably want to spend more time
with his video game buddy .
yeah . you know , but i just keep thinking ...
what &apos;s it gonna be like for him ?
you know , the traveling back and forth
he &apos;s a kid . he &apos;ll adjust .
two schools , two sets of friends .
it &apos;s not going to be easy .
why are you being so negative ?
i thought you &apos;d be excited about this .
i know you did .
i just want you to ask yourself .
is this all really in the best interest of travers ?
kids need stability .
what about what i need ?
i know that you miss him .
i know that you &apos;re worried about being lonely ,
but i am going to be here for you .
yeah , once every two weeks .
no , i &apos;m really going to be here for you .
and i &apos;m gonna make you happy .
don &apos;t say that if you don &apos;t mean it , carlos .
i do .
all right . i &apos;ii , um ...
i &apos;ll call off the lawyer .
you know , i really am gonna miss him .
yeah . me , too .
ladies and gentlemen ,
please join me and welcome the next mayor of fairview ,
victor lang !

i think so .
&lt; i &gt; anyone can end up a victim ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... injured by the actions of others . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but whether the damage is inflicted by a cunning ex @-@ wife ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... or a blow delivered by the object of our affection ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... the time comes when we must pick ourselves up &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and continue on ourjourney . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and if we can &apos;t , then all we can pray for ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... is rescue . &lt; / i &gt;
mike . i twisted my ankle .
good .
because now i get to do this .
