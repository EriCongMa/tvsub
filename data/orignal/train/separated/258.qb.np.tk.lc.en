and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
i need your passion for social upheaval
to help me write the book about the upper east side .
that &apos;s what i want .
are you sure that i &apos;m the one person you wanna be with ?
you have always been the one .
daniel humphrey has just released the latest installment
of his serial--a chapter on our very own serena .
why would you write this now ?
you were supposed to be different .
i used to be .
got me nowhere .
so now i &apos;m the same .
what i want isn &apos;t in brooklyn . i have a plan .
i have this whole time .
i wrote two versions of the serena chapter ,
and that &apos;s-- that &apos;s the nice one .
i prefer the nasty one you published .
i know i &apos;ve hurt you ,
but i &apos;ve never stopped loving you .
well , excuse me if i don &apos;t fall for that ,
or you , ever again .
when i first met you ,
you had the perfect story to get new york &apos;s attention .
what , gossip girl &apos;s identity ?
i promised her i &apos;d stop looking
after she helped find serena .
she set you up to protect herself .
what do you have to lose
by going through your research one more time ?
so ... lily &apos;s still with bart ?
yes .
the only thing that matters is that you finally know the truth .
i do , and i &apos;m sorry .
what on earth do you have to be sorry for ?
it won &apos;t be much longer , i promise .
i have a plan .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
bart is not stupid enough to leave any evidence .
stop your witch hunt
and leave new york for moscow tonight .
what are you doing ?
i couldn &apos;t live with myself if anything happened to you .
don &apos;t get on the plane .
i made a deal . those were my father &apos;s terms .
the coast guard is investigating the area
where the plane went off the radar
after sending a mayday signal .
i hope that wasn &apos;t the one chuck was on .
he just tried to have his own son killed .
who do you think they &apos;re gonna believe ,
the man of the year
or some sad ,
pathetic ,
little boy ? !
no !
chuck .
give me your hand !
you know i &apos;m all talk .
i would never really hurt you .
everything you say is a lie !
charles , this isn &apos;t who you are .
please , son !
come on .
we have to get out of here .
2012纽约地产界风云人物
guys , there &apos;s a situation .
what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s a body .
a body ? whose ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
okay , thanks .
do what you need to do .
don &apos;t tell anyone you talked to me .
arthur &apos;s stuck out front .
they &apos;re stopping all the cars from the event .
give me the phone .
why don &apos;t you let me help you ?
i know a lot of people here .
if you can just give me a name ...
you ask a lot of questions .
maybe you should give me your name .
i have to take this .
here &apos;s a lovely young woman
who will tell everything that she knows ...
which is nothing .
are you arthur ?
在这之前要等一个人回到我身边
excuse me , would you tell the pilot
i &apos;m gonna need another moment , please ? thank you .
when you &apos;re ready .
you dug up a lot of good dirt .
we just have to sift through it again .
you know the history . i &apos;m a fresh set of eyes .
the answer to &quot; who is gossip girl ? &quot;
is right on this table .
wait . what ? ivy says i need to turn on the tv .
we &apos;re told a man has been found dead outside an event
where the manhattan real estate community was gathering
to honor their man of the year , bartholomew bass .
the name of the deceased is being withheld ...
until family members can be notified .
sorry .
hello ?
yes , this is mrs. bass .
what ? !
you &apos;ve reached william . please leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s me .
so you know how as long as bart bass was around ,
it wasn &apos;t safe to come to the city ?
well , it &apos;s safe now .
call me .
shockwaves ran through this crowd moments ago
as the news spread
that the deceased was none other than bart bass himself ,
the man they had gathered to honor .
good night .
this comes on the heels
of a series of bizarre events earlier tonight .
first , a false report that a bass industries jet
had been downed .
then bass &apos;son charles caused a disturbance ,
requiring him to be removed by security .
yes , this is chuck bass &apos; limo , but he &apos;s not with me .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t heard from him since i dropped him off .
mr. bass often finds his own way home from these things .
all clear .
all right .
chuck bass is considered a person of interest
in this case , as he &apos;s wanted for questioning ,
although we have no information on his whereabouts .
now being a person of interest
does not necessarily mean he &apos;s a suspect at this point .
what it means is that
police feel he &apos;ll have information on this case .
by the time i got to the party , chuck was already gone .
i didn &apos;t even see him .
so you , missed the outburst
where he accused his father of trying to kill him ?
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
do you ?
she &apos;s not talking to you . she &apos;s a minor .
anyone want some coffee ?
look , chuck likes drama . okay ? he was probably wasted .
i &apos;m sure it was just nothing , the usual father and son stuff .
and what do you know about his relationship
with , bair waldorf ?
blair &apos;s relationship to chuck is none of your business .
besides , it &apos;s very complicated , with many ups and downs .
would take long time to explain .
look , chuck bass is missing .
if your daughter &apos;s with him , she could be in a lot of trouble .
what kind of trouble ?
aiding and abetting . maybe worse .
aiding and abetting what ?
you don &apos;t really think that chuck had something to do
with what happened to bart ?
you mind if i check her bed , see if it was slept in ?
yes , i mind .
you &apos;re not searching anything here without a warrant .
in fact , i think this conversation is over .
i understand you , recently went to jail yourself ,
mr. archibald .
hate to see ya back there .
so i &apos;m sorry , but nobody &apos;s gonna be saying another word
without a lawyer present--
a lawyer who isn &apos;t me .
this is outrageous .
i mean , it &apos;s not like blair and chuck killed the man .
no . what ?
no .
who is it ?
room service .
i have terrible news .
bart &apos;s dead .
what are you doing here ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard , but ,
a lot of people are looking for ya .
blair , you can come on out . uncle jack &apos;s here to help .
you &apos;re , you &apos;re still in manhattan ,
and you &apos;re here .
i spent all night reading and rereading ,
and then i realized i can &apos;t leave
until i know if what you wrote is true .
it is , every single word of it .
do you understand how i feel now ?
no .
no , actually , i &apos;m more confused than ever .
which one is the real you--
the one that wrote this chapter or the one in &quot; vanity fair &quot; ?
and &quot; both &quot; is not an acceptable answer .
you know , yeah , i still had a tracking device on your limo
from back in the day when i hated you ,
and i thought it was a little odd when your limo driver made
a midnight trip to a romantic inn in windham .
anyway ...
you kill him or not ?
&apos;cause if you didn &apos;t , running sure makes it look like you did .
chuck did nothing wrong .
that &apos;s not entirely true .
i didn &apos;t help him .
who shoved who first ? who got hit ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know .
it was self @-@ defense .
bart tried to kill you on that plane .
i saved myself , then i fought back .
i @-@ i don &apos;t feel guilty , but ...
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not .
anyways , bart made it clear
he owns captain donnelley .
can you help us get out of here ?
a @-@ a nice deserted island with no extradition treaties ?
we don &apos;t need money . we can live off the land .
as much as i &apos;d love to see
you spearfishing in a coconut bikini ,
i ...
had another thought .
were there security cameras on that roof ?
bart turned them off .
because he was going to kill you .
who saw you up there ?
him and blair .
and i won &apos;t say a word .
even if they torture me , i won &apos;t speak .
i , uh , had a different kind of torture in mind .
marriage .
spousal privilege means
that a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband .
not like this , blair .
why not ?
we &apos;re in love , and ...
one way or another , we both achieved our goals .
and every trembling bone
in my tired and scared body wants to marry you .
it &apos;s twisted but it &apos;s , uh , very you .
jack is right .
chuck and blair hold hands ?
chuck and blair go to the movies ?
you said you never wanted us to be boring .
well , we definitely aren &apos;t that now .
i was a stupid child when i said those things .
life with you
could never be boring .
blair cornelia waldorf ,
will you marry me ?
yes .
yes , i will .
oh ! william , hello .
lily , i am so sorry .
my deepest condolences for bart &apos;s passing .
yes . i &apos;m still trying to process the news .
it &apos;s all very shocking and upsetting .
well , without rufus and your mother in your life ,
i thought you could use the support .
you know , the police are looking for chuck ,
the press is on your heels ,
and you &apos;ve got a funeral to plan .
oh , god . a funeral .
well ...
the good news is ,
we can do the same thing we did the last time bart died .
honestly , i would be grateful to have you by my side .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna get through this day alone .
well , let &apos;s start by getting you upstairs
and getting you some of that tea you love so much .
okay , you need to explain everything , from the beginning--
the very , very beginning .
yeah . uh ...
all right , well ...
i &apos;d been going to school with you guys for a while ,
but that night was the first night
that i &apos;d been to one of your parties .
of course , i soon realized
that i &apos;d been invited by accident .
hey , matt .
no , n--you know , my name &apos;s actually--
good game against trinity last week , huh ?
game ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not who you think i am .
watch it .
but i didn &apos;t care if i wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
once i got inside , i wasn &apos;t leaving
because that &apos;s when i saw you .
i &apos;d seen you before at school , on the steps of the met ,
but i &apos;d never seen you like this .
what are you doing , standing there all by yourself ?
don &apos;t you ever go to parties ?
i , um , yeah . sure , yeah . i--yeah , i went to ...
uh , birthdays as a kid . well , my own .
i , um , i have a cousin who &apos;s jewish ,
and her bat mitzvah was rockin &apos; .
ah . oh . you were joking .
yeah , i was .
no , so--i mean , i was ...
yeah , i was , too . i was joking .
no , i wasn &apos;t . i was-- her bat mitzvah was ...
it sucked . it was hello kitty @-@ themed .
i love hello kitty .
so do i.
i was joking again .
you probably should get out more .
well , you see what happens when i do ?
and this is so bad ?
o.m.g !
kati just puked on her prada !
is is taking pictures with her cell phone .
we have to go wish her happy barfday !
that &apos;s amazing .
i wish i remembered any of that , but i don &apos;t--
probably because i had too much champagne .
or because you thought i was a lacrosse player named matt .
no , i didn &apos;t realize that .
no , but that &apos;s good news . it &apos;s great news .
yeah , just have the papers sent over . thanks .
was that about the search warrant ?
it was about &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i mean , now that bart &apos;s dead , my name &apos;s the only one on the loan .
if i can pay off what i owe , it &apos;ll be all mine .
that &apos;s amazing .
and if we can figure out this &quot; gossip girl &quot; expose ,
you &apos;ll have the perfect story to make it happen .
yeah . i just wish i felt like celebrating .
i &apos;m sure chuck &apos;s not calling
&apos;cause he doesn &apos;t want to get me in trouble ,
but i really need to know he &apos;s okay .
if he &apos;s with blair , he &apos;s okay .
she won &apos;t let anything bad happen to him .
okay . hold on one second , okay ?
of course we have to get married in a courthouse .
maybe we should get out of here .
relax . we &apos;re just two crazy kids dying to tie the knot .
if anyone recognizes you ,
then that knot will become a noose around your neck .
i got the license .
backdated , of course ,
lest someone suspects your union was motivated
by something other than your tender feelings .
the justice of the peace is waiting for you .
okay .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s do this .
blair , you don &apos;t have to .
i want to .
i know this isn &apos;t your dream wedding .
last night &apos;s dress , no flowers ,
the cake from the doughnut shop down the street .
i already had my princess wedding .
there were enough peonies to last a lifetime .
maybe you don &apos;t need flowers ,
but your mother , cyrus , serena ...
you should be surrounded by the people you love .
you love me .
i love the both of you .
it is just not worth the risk of bringing everyone here .
look , you might be okay with it ,
but i &apos;m not sure i wanna start the rest of our lives this way .
chuck .
don &apos;t worry , daphne .
i &apos;m heading over to dan &apos;s right now .
i know you need the final chapter today .
hey . you georgina sparks ?
depends on who &apos;s asking . you kgb ?
jxb . jack xavier bass .
chuck &apos;s uncle jack .
don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve had the pleasure .
blair says when it comes to a scheme ,
your skills are second to none .
she doesn &apos;t exaggerate .
then what are you waitin &apos; on , sparks ?
let &apos;s see if the woman lives up to the name .
oh ! thank you for letting me lean on you today .
i would simply be lost .
william !
ivy , right ?
i would hope , on a day like today ,
you would be able to give me some measure of peace .
oh , if there is one thing you &apos;re not getting today , it &apos;s peace .
and now that william &apos;s here , we can tell you together .
you know , they say success is nothing
without someone to share it with .
i have no idea what game this young woman is playing .
i don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve even seen you since , um , ...
uh , cece &apos;s wake .
what ?
we &apos;ve been working together for months .
he &apos;s in love with me .
i have william &apos;s texts on my phone .
my children know how to make it look like
someone sent them a text message when they haven &apos;t ,
so i &apos;m sure you know the same tricks .
he ... he helped transfer cece &apos;s money to me .
you can ask lola .
well , lola &apos;s out of the country doing a film in budapest ,
so unfortunately , she &apos;s , uh , not available .
i &apos;m gonna go get the doorman .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting exactly what i wanted--to be with lily ,
the love of my life , the mother of my children .
and i thank you ...
i truly thank you
for the role you played in making that possible .
i &apos;ll tell everyone .
i &apos;ll tell the media .
the media ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you &apos;re a lifetime movie called
&quot; nobody gives a damn : the ivy dickens story . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what you have to complain about .
you got lola &apos;s money .
now go back to florida ,
run along and be the queen of the swamp people .
you &apos;re the devil !
all right , miss .
don &apos;t make me have to call the police .
i loved you , william , with all my heart ! i did !
ivy and serena &apos;s daddy doctor ?
didn &apos;t see that one coming .
oh . what do you two want ?
you .
look , don &apos;t be mad .
i came back because i wanna understand .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not mad . i just ...
okay , have you ever wanted something so badly ,
but you just know you &apos;re not gonna get it ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
i ... i forgot who i &apos;m talking to . of course you haven &apos;t .
but that--that was--that was ... my whole life .
and the moment you walked away from me ,
i knew there was no way i could ever
pull you out of your world and into mine .
but i couldn &apos;t give up .
wait . the school trip to
the &quot; intrepid &quot; museum ?
yeah . i overheard two girls talking about you
in your white dress , getting wet ,
and , um ...
one girl thought that you would be laughingstock .
you know , and that--and that everyone would be ...
talking about you .
but then her friend said ,
&quot; that &apos;s the point .
you &apos;re no one until you &apos;re talked about . &quot;
so you came home , and you told all of this to jenny ,
and that was the beginning of gossip girl ?
so you &apos;ve had the power to reveal her identity this entire time ?
come . we have a mission .
&quot; we &quot; ? &quot; we &quot; who ?
what--what mission ?
do you two seriously not have any idea why i &apos;m here ?
what have you been doing for the last 12 hours ?
在犯罪现场
so obviously , gossip girl &apos;s known you all since ninth grade ,
but it &apos;s doubtful that someone older
would &apos;ve cared about a bunch of freshmen ,
so she &apos;s the same age . or younger .
that &apos;s what we always figured .
but you went to different colleges after graduation .
she couldn &apos;t have followed all of you .
by that time , it didn &apos;t matter .
she &apos;d already built up her network of sources .
i mean , she could &apos;ve been anywhere in the world .
like at sarah lawrence ,
where eric van der woodsen goes ?
or maybe london , where jenny humphrey lives ?
i thought of that .
eric maybe , but gossip girl was pretty brutal on jenny .
i mean , no one would do that to themselves .
are you kidding ? battling blair , the fashion line--
even you had a crush on her .
little j. was my idol in seventh grade .
but i get your point .
is there anyone gossip girl ever went easy on ?
someone she cared about ? that could be a clue .
the only selfless thing she ever did
was shut down after chuck and blair &apos;s accident .
although , she did lead dan and blair to juliet
after serena was drugged . that was the right thing to do .
and wasn &apos;t there a lot of stuff that she knew but didn &apos;t post
until serena went to war with her at graduation ?
maybe gossip girl was really our guardian angel .
spotted-- chuck bass back in manhattan .
we hear he &apos;s on his way to turn himself in .
who &apos;s up for a little stakeout at the big house ?
well , so much for that theory .
yeah .
jack ?
come on . let &apos;s go .
take your time . i mean , whatever . come on , let &apos;s go !
did you just see what i saw ?
what are the chances that serena , dan , nate , and georgina sparks
all decided to check out the warhol exhibit together ?
zero . come on , ally .
hey , mom !
chuck !
sorry i couldn &apos;t call .
you really scared us , man .
oh ! i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re safe .
you know , just a little confused as to why we &apos;re all here .
are you saying good @-@ bye before you turn yourself in ?
why does everyone look like they &apos;re here for a funeral ?
when you &apos;re here for a wedding .
a woman like blair deserves to be married with style ,
surrounded by friends and family .
no bass man would let himself be stopped
by a little thing like a tristate apb .
hey , enough with the small talk .
we all have a job to do .
blair and chuck , stay out of sight .
then we meet at the bethesda fountain
and get married .
miss eleanor , go--go get the dress ! a @-@ and--and the rings !
the rings ! you ! you ! rings !
and--and , uh , mr ...
chuck and blair are getting married ? !
this is the biggest &quot; gossip girl &quot; story ever .
oh , my gosh !
you look amazing !
b , the dress is perfection !
well , a lifelong relationship with elie saab
does have its perks .
my mother did well .
hey , have you seen dan ? i &apos;m a little nervous .
the last time he was in charge of flowers ,
we ended up with damien dalgaard &apos;s purple tulip .
well , speaking of , is dan here as your date ?
i mean , after he published his hate piece ,
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re even talking to him at all .
yeah , he had his reasons . i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m still trying to figure it out .
and come on , it &apos;s not like chuck didn &apos;t
do his fair share of terrible things to you .
ancient history !
and besides , chuck is one of us , whereas dan ,
despite his years of trying , never will be .
what does &quot; one of us &quot; even mean after all this time ?
he &apos;s friends with our friends .
we--we both dated him . his father married my mother .
his--his new apartment is in my building .
s , we all hoped that humble humphrey would overcome
his brooklyn roots to join a higher social strata .
i mean , after all , it &apos;s the american dream .
but let &apos;s face it . in his case , the dream has died .
just give him one more chance . you don &apos;t know the whole story .
i know what i need to know , and that is ,
serena van der woodsen will never end up
with a powerless striver .
where are you going ? the fountain is that way .
yeah , i might be a little late for that .
there &apos;s something i gotta take care of first .
something ? like what ? if this is about the final chapter ,
you better not be giving it to &quot; vanity fair &quot;
before i &apos;ve read it .
i &apos;m not giving it to &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
what ? wait ! where are you going ? !
stop it ! oh !
should i even ask what happened on that rooftop ?
the less you know , the better .
ah . then for once ,
i guess it &apos;s a good thing that i &apos;m out of the loop .
chuck ! hey !
sorry to interrupt your last fling , but i got the rings .
the choice was between byzantine cross and egyptian snake .
i assume , like attracted like , and you went with the snake ?
you know me well , nephew .
nate .
this is for you .
it &apos;s my final chapter .
you mean my final chapter ,
and it &apos;s not for you .
wait . this is about gossip girl .
that &apos;s yours to publish in &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i know you gave up your search to help serena .
now you have all your answers .
dan , this is incredible .
i have to find sage .
i mean , she can run this down to the office .
thanks , man .
i mean , this could change my life .
mine , too , hopefully .
i should &apos;ve known better than to back a horse from d.u.m.b.o.
all right , don &apos;t let anyone stop you or ask any questions .
just go straight to my computer and start typing .
post paragraph by paragraph if you need to .
got it .
what is taking gossip girl so long ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if gossip girl doesn &apos;t care about out tip ,
i bet the police will .
thea ! the police ?
what ? chuck &apos;s a fugitive from the law .
if it &apos;s not on &quot; g.g. , &quot; at least it &apos;ll be on the news .
hi , i have information on the location of chuck bass .
to quote siddhartha ,
we are not going in circles . we are going upward .
the path is a spiral .
we have already climbed many ste--
cyrus , i think that is enough .
perhaps we could skip to the &quot; i do &quot; part .
where &apos;s the rings ?
do you , chuck ,
take blair to be your lawfully wedded wife ?
three words . eight letters .
blair , do you take chuck to be your lawfully wedded husband ?
one word . three letters . yes !
then by the power invested in me by the great state of new york ,
i now pronounce you man and wife !
you may kiss the bride !
chuck bass !
chuck bass ? you need to come with us .
you , too , ms. waldorf .
i &apos;m with you .
me , too .
and me .
right on cue , gossip girl .
it &apos;s not gossip girl .
it &apos;s &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i &apos;m shocked .
i thought it was dorota .
what ?
seriously ?
no
way .
oh , you have got to be kidding me .
that little bitch !
hey , upper east siders .
gossip girl here ,
and i have the biggest news ever .
&quot; serena ! you &apos;re back from boarding school . &quot;
&quot; yeah . hi , blair . so i gotta go- &quot; &quot;
come on , bell . can you just try a little harder ?
i &apos;m sorry . if i &apos;m being really honest , rachel ,
i don &apos;t think you can pull off high school anymore .
thanks a lot .
sorry .
oh , come on ! you are always on that thing .
this audition &apos;s really important to me .
plus , the book is a best @-@ seller
and it has a built @-@ in movie audience .
dan humphrey is a really good writer .
o.m.g.
you are not going to believe who gossip girl is .
wait . gossip girl is real ?
the upper east side was like
something from fitzgerald or thackeray--
teenagers acting like adults ,
adults acting like teenagers ,
guarding secrets , spreading gossip ,
all with the trappings of truly opulent wealth .
and membership in this community was so elite ,
you couldn &apos;t even buy your way in .
it was a birthright--
a birthright i didn &apos;t have .
耶鲁 恰克 · 拜斯
and my greatest achievements would never earn me .
all i had to compare to this world
was what i &apos;d read in books .
but that gave me the idea .
if i wasn &apos;t born into this world ,
maybe i could write myself into it .
i &apos;d overheard enough conversations
to be able to mimic the language
of the constance girls ,
but every writer needs his muse .
and it wasn &apos;t until that photo of serena in the white dress
that i knew i had something strong enough
to actually create a legend .
and launch a web site .
within weeks , i was getting dozens of e @-@ mails
with stories about upper east siders ,
so i posted them anonymously .
and then i got more .
oh , my god .
before long , it was a monster .
everyone was sending tips .
i am so glad gossip girl finally got her balls back .
and when serena came back from boarding school ,
i wrote my first post about me .
lonely boy ,
the outsider , the underdog .
i might &apos;ve been a joke , but ...
at least people were talking about me .
this is a hell of a thing you pulled off , kid .
i &apos;m in awe .
i hacked it and stole it from him .
that makes me way more awesome .
no , you stole it after i shut it down .
and when you started it back up , i just stole it again .
i should &apos;ve known it was you
on the surveillance tape diana sent me .
you were the only one who wasn &apos;t there with us that night .
and you &apos;re the only one who owns a hoodie .
the one i felt stupid about was graduation ,
when i asked gossip girl to meet me , and then dan showed up .
son .
dad .
i figured you &apos;d be here waiting for chuck and blair .
we need to talk .
i should drink .
me , too .
uh , vodka on the rocks .
big glass , not too many rocks .
three olives .
dan , i cannot believe
you are the one responsible for all of this poison .
the damage you &apos;ve done to your friends , to your family ,
to your own sister !
jenny wanted to get on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
she &apos;s known it was me for years .
if there &apos;s ever anything she really didn &apos;t want posted ,
all she had to do was ask .
you told the whole world about her losing her virginity !
no , no , no . no , she sent that tip in herself .
she wanted to get out of new york ,
but she didn &apos;t feel like
she had the strength to leave on her own .
so she knew if blair found out the truth ,
she wouldn &apos;t have a choice .
her leaving town
was the best thing that ever happened to jenny .
yeah . i mean , look , dad ,
i &apos;ve screwed up , and plenty of times .
but i &apos;ve always tried to do the right thing ,
like you taught me .
tell me everything .
dan was as hard on himself as he was any of us .
and he wouldn &apos;t have had anything to post
if everyone hadn &apos;t been sending in tips .
i never sent in one tip .
saint nate .
come on , what was the worst thing
gossip girl ever wrote about you ?
if anyone should be mad ...
it--it should be me ... or me and blair .
we &apos;re here !
you &apos;re free !
so everything &apos;s okay ?
well , cyrus is finishing up at the police station .
but we refused to talk .
and since there &apos;s no actual evidence
that chuck was even on that roof .
and no witness .
except his wife .
they had to no choice but to let us go .
bart &apos;s death will be ruled as an accident .
thank you .
no , this is actually for her .
miss blair , i @-@ i so worried about you and , uh , mr. chuck ,
and brain exploding from lonely boy news .
i need vodka .
we all need lots of vodka , dorota .
and champagne .
my mother and lily are at citarella right now getting food .
we &apos;re gonna have a wedding reception .
and don &apos;t even think that you will be invited , humphrey .
we read while we were waiting .
you have a lot of explaining to do .
what do you wanna know , blair ?
what do you look so amused for ?
uh , it &apos;s just that i felt the same way
until i realized that i &apos;m fine with it .
fine ?
he stopped posting after our accident .
he shut down the site .
i mean , we always knew it was one of us , right ?
i always thought it was dorota !
you know , i actually thought it was eric for a little bit ,
and then i thought it was you , rufus .
my dad ? come on .
hey ! it could &apos;ve been me . i always thought it was nate .
did anyone think it could be me ?
my money was on the blonde broad in london .
why do you all think that this is funny ?
gossip girl ruined our lives !
is your life really ruined , blair ?
if you think about it ,
we &apos;re all on track to do exactly what we wanted to do .
but he schemed and lied and spread horrible stories .
blair , i think you &apos;re just mad because dan was the one
who was pulling the strings all along .
this whole time , i had more power than you .
but what he did with that power was write a love letter--
not just to me but to all of us .
it made me realize i don &apos;t want to run away ,
that--that you guys are my family , and i belong here .
and so does dan .
well , i guess that means it &apos;s all over now ,
that we can all grow up and move on .
yeah .
gossip girl &apos;s dead .
good to see you again .
mr. archibald , what do you say to speculation that you &apos;ll be
announcing your bid for the mayor &apos;s race any day now ?
i say new york is the greatest city in the world .
who wouldn &apos;t wanna be mayor ?
you &apos;d be the youngest mayor ever in the history of the city .
only if i win . and i haven &apos;t even said if i &apos;m running .
the polls already have you out in front .
i promise i &apos;ll answer any questions you have tomorrow ,
but right now there &apos;s somewhere i have to be .
thank you , mr. henry .
you very good boy , help tidy up for party .
look who &apos;s here !
daddy !
there is my grandson ! henry !
come here , boy ! come here ! come here ! come here !
come on ! ah !
how are you ?
the place looks great .
it was all blair . thank you .
no . no , i told you that tuesday is not soon enough .
i need the samples in the showroom by monday .
okay , i have to go . i have guests .
xiexie . zaijian .
do you have any idea how many times i &apos;d wondered
if we &apos;d ever make it to this day ?
and now ... here we are .
no doubt thanks to your wonderful parenting .
mm ! oh , my ...
i know . i know .
last @-@ minute inspiration .
how is she ?
oh , great . not nervous at all . i am . i need a drink .
hey . sorry i &apos;m late . hey , looking good .
you may be rid of dan humphrey ,
but you &apos;ll never be rid of me .
there will always be someone on the outside ,
wanting to get in .
who am i now ?
that &apos;s one secret i &apos;ll never tell .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
