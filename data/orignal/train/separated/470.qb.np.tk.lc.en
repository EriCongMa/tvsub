the return
just you two tonight ?
i promised the birthday girl we &apos;d celebrate
with a slice of pie no matter what time my shift ended .
oh , don &apos;t tell me , let me guess .
you &apos;re ... 16 .
no , silly , i &apos;m 7 .
oh . well , i tell you what .
why don &apos;t you do the honors
and you pick the place to sit .
over there .
good choice .
i personally think these are the best seats in the house .
now , who wants some pie ?
you know what flavor you want ?
what shall we get ?
tell you what .
why don &apos;t i give you a minute to decide
and i &apos;ll come back and take your order .
great , thanks .
by the way , chocolate cream pie &apos;s the best .
ok .
sorry for the wait .
we &apos;re light on staff tonight .
that &apos;s the number 4--scrambled eggs , hashbrowns ,
sausage , and bacon ,
and this is on the house .
let me know if you need anything else , hon .
good evening , officer .
hey , leah .
oh , i need to run to the back
to get more cream and sugar .
the only sugar i want is you .
i told you , i don &apos;t date married men .
what if i told you my wife just moved out ?
then i &apos;d tell you to lose the wedding band
and then i &apos;ll consider .
how we doin &apos; over here , hon ?
is everything all right ?
can i get you something else ?
ok . uh ...
i &apos;ll just leave this here ,
and whenever you &apos;re ready--
oh , my god !
baby .
babe ?
what are you doing ? why are you still up ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry if i woke you up .
the hospital just called . a 6 @-@ car pileup on the east end .
oh , lusty would probably need a walk in a few hours ,
do you mind taking him out ?
i already filled his bowls , so he should be good for now .
uh , eggs and juice in the fridge ,
so feel free to help yourself .
i made a fresh pot of coffee .
make sure you unplug it when you &apos;re done .
don &apos;t forget to lock up when you leave .
good morning to you , too .
30分钟后开会
this is a joke , right ?
and everybody else is practically done
with their knitting projects ,
even ethel , who &apos;s like pushing 90 .
and this bathing suit was supposed to be done in july
and i keep having to rework it . but i got this part , see .
yeah , it &apos;s fine . it looks nice .
you &apos;re not really looking at my project .
you always look at my projects , derek . what &apos;s wrong ?
ah , baby girl , i &apos;m sorry . i mean , i don &apos;t know--
me and savannah , we had like this amazing night .
then cut to 4 hours later ,
she &apos;s throwing me an air kiss and rushing out the door to work ,
and i &apos;m stuck at 2 : 00 in the morning walking her little pug .
ohh ... you got morganed .
morganed ? what ? what are you talking about ?
you are on call 24 / 7 , and when a case comes in ,
you drop whatever and whoever you are doing
and you haul ass back to work .
well , i guess i never thought about it like that .
and now you &apos;re having what oprah calls an aha moment .
think about it . if you would have gotten that call ,
you would have done the exact same thing to her .
because your job comes first and so does hers .
and that is why you two work .
oh my gosh .
she is you in heels .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m always right .
also , you &apos;re secretly in love with me .
door ?
forgive me .
my queen .
don &apos;t let it happen again .
a few hours ago ,
a lone gunman shot and killed 3 people
inside a downtown chicago diner .
then , he was taken down by a plainclothes off @-@ duty officer
who happened to be in the restaurant
at the same time of the shooting .
well , it sounds like they got their guy .
why are they requesting our help ?
because an atm from across the street
captured this image of the shooter getting out of
a late @-@ model sedan just moments before the shooting
and here &apos;s a shot of his driver who then sped off .
chicago p.d. i.d. &apos; d the shooter
as 16 @-@ year @-@ old gavin rossler
after getting a composite match
from the national center for missing and exploited children .
according to the database ,
gavin &apos;s been missing for nearly 4 years .
in looks like back in 2009
when the mother filed the police report
she insisted gavin had been abducted .
mom was not the most credible source .
she was in and out of rehab facilities
for drug and alcohol abuse ,
died 6 months ago of an apparent drug overdose .
it says here gavin had run away from home several times
but always returned within 24 hours .
which could by why local p.d. initially categorized him
as a runaway rather than missing .
so where &apos;s this kid been all this time ,
and where did he meet his partner in crime ?
garcia , have you been able to i.d. the driver ?
negative . i &apos;m running the image
through facial recognition software right now , though .
we can &apos;t rule out the possibility that the driver
is the person responsible for gavin &apos;s disappearance .
if that &apos;s the case , chances are
he &apos;s out looking for his next victim .
how does a 12 @-@ year @-@ old runaway turn into a cold @-@ blooded killer ?
wheels up in 30 .
i &apos;m standing here with sylvia hoover ,
who was at the diner with her 7 @-@ year @-@ old daughter
at the time of the shooting .
sylvia , can you tell us in your own words what happened ?
i was sitting at the counter with my daughter
when i heard a woman screaming ,
and that &apos;s when i turned around and saw the gun .
and i don &apos;t know , this kid just stood up and started shooting .
alfred hitchcock said ,
&quot; there is no terror in the bang ,
only in the anticipation of it . &quot;
leah rollins was the first victim .
she was working her regular overnight shift at the diner .
the second victim was kyle workman .
he worked at a local convenience store .
and the third was violet hartford . she was a schoolteacher .
it seems like other than late @-@ night cravings ,
there was no connection
between the victims and gavin .
it looks as though he was born into a high @-@ risk lifestyle .
dad &apos;s been incarcerated since gavin was 4 .
on two separate occasions
he was removed from his mother &apos;s custody
and placed in foster care .
well , despite all that , he managed to get good grades .
so 4 years ago--
why did he choose that day to leave ?
well , that &apos;s if he left by choice .
well , the mom &apos;s boyfriend moved in a couple weeks prior .
maybe he and gavin were bumping heads .
i mean , things might have even gotten physical
between the two of them .
yeah , at one point mom admitted that she and prince charming
had been out on a binge for a couple of days .
which means gavin would have been left home alone
to fend for himself .
and i &apos;m sure that wasn &apos;t the first time .
maybe he just had enough .
this kid &apos;s from garfield park .
that &apos;s prime gang territory .
if he was left unsupervised from sunup to sundown ,
chances are he fell in with the wrong crowd .
chicago has one of the largest gang populations ,
over 100,000 active members .
last year 61 % of all homicides were found to be gang related .
well , it makes sense . i mean , the kid runs away from home
and finds himself out on the street .
then some knucklehead gangbangers come along ,
recruit him , and promise him protection .
next thing you know , he &apos;s got the &quot; family &quot; that he never had .
garcia , we need a list of active gangs
operating in the area .
copy that .
we need to hit the ground running .
if this is some sort of mass gang initiation ,
it could be the first of a series of attacks .
detective mark reyes , chicago p.d.
thank you both for coming out .
i thought there , uh ,
i thought there weren &apos;t any cameras .
those are phony .
cheaper than installing the real thing .
in this neighborhood , you gotta put something
to deter would @-@ be robbers .
according to witnesses ,
the gunman ...
sat right over there .
then without warning ,
he just stood up and started firing .
gavin had no criminal record ,
enters cool and collected and orders a meal .
normally it takes time and practice
to build up to something like this .
rarely does anything these punks do make sense .
which makes me wonder why gavin chose this diner
for his first offense .
i mean , there &apos;s a police station just a few blocks away .
not to mention , aren &apos;t gang initiations
known for inciting violence against rival gangs ?
true . and typically , these guys like to leave their marks .
there weren &apos;t any tags claiming responsibility .
gangbangers are driven by money and power .
gavin didn &apos;t seem to be driven by either .
what do you mean ?
well , if it really had been about money ,
gavin would have entered the diner
and immediately gone to the register .
and if it had been about power ,
he probably would have walked around ,
flashed his gun to maximize terror .
so if it wasn &apos;t gang related ,
what was it ?
that &apos;s a good question .
single gunshot wound to the chest .
he died before paramedics arrived .
still trying to determine what caused these burns on his temple .
have you gotten back the toxicology results ?
he was clean .
no drugs or alcohol .
excuse me .
was this everything ?
that &apos;s all he came with .
well , how many kids you know these days
that don &apos;t carry a phone on them ?
the first thing a runaway does is pick up a disposable .
most of the time we get street kids ,
they &apos;ll be somewhat malnourished
or have some type of correlating health issues .
he didn &apos;t show any signs of either .
it seems like whoever this kid was with
at least made sure he was fed properly .
there &apos;s multiple spiral fractures on both arms .
when i took the x @-@ rays , it was evident
that his fractures hadn &apos;t healed properly .
typically you only see that in cases of abuse
with toddlers and young children ,
not someone gavin &apos;s age .
well , whoever did this had to have literally
twisted his arms until they broke .
were you able to determine if these injuries occurred
before or after he was reported missing ?
i &apos;d say somewhere as early as 6 months ago .
that rules out the mom and boyfriend .
if they didn &apos;t cause them , who did ?
look , i don &apos;t know what good this is gonna do .
now , i wrote everything up in my report .
well , uh , sometimes our subconscious picks up details
our conscious minds aren &apos;t aware of .
can you close your eyes for me ?
ok .
now , i need you to take me back to the diner .
can you see gavin ?
sitting on the other side of the diner .
leah stopped to check on him .
did you hear anything they said to each other ?
they were sitting too far away .
as soon as she put the check down ,
that &apos;s when i heard the first shot .
all hell broke loose .
ok , now , i need you to focus on gavin
and stay with him .
the guy at the table , he tried to run .
the kid got him in the chest .
where did he fire his next shot ?
this woman , she was sitting at the counter .
she was just looking for a way out .
is that when you took your shot ?
i was next .
i &apos;ll never forget the look in that kid &apos;s eyes .
it was like he was ready to die .
they say the worst part about being a cop
is watching these people die in front of you .
they were right .
a .9 beretta semiautomatic
with government markings .
military .
these days you can buy almost anything off the streets .
which is why i have my guys running serial numbers .
hopefully we can come up with some type of match .
even if they come back with a match ,
chances are this weapon &apos;s
made its way through a number of pawn shops .
then that &apos;s where we &apos;ll start .
the most important thing to find out now
is where gavin got his hands on that .
go ahead , mama .
i pulled this video footage from across the street from the diner .
i managed to get a partial plate off the car .
i &apos;m running it now .
garcia , can you pause it ?
rewind it a moment just after gavin steps out of the car .
you see that ? the driver didn &apos;t wait around
for him to enter the diner before he drove off .
well , maybe he sensed something was up .
why not wait to make sure everything went as planned ?
i mean , what if something went wrong
and the mission had to be aborted ?
how would the driver let him know inside ?
he couldn &apos;t even if he wanted to .
gavin didn &apos;t have a phone on him .
maybe that &apos;s why the driver drove off .
he knew that gavin wasn &apos;t planning on leaving the diner alive .
this was a suicide mission .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with you ? !
you could &apos;ve killed somebody !
get out of the vehicle right now !
get the hell out of the car !
do you hear me ?
get out of the car !
i know that look .
the wheels are turning .
i &apos;ve seen this before .
muzzle @-@ flash burns .
we &apos;d occasionally see this on pows in vietnam .
so someone held a gun to his head and repeatedly fired blanks .
that &apos;s incredibly risky ,
especially considering the margin of error
when you &apos;re holding the barrel of a gun
to someone &apos;s temporal bone .
the discharge alone can cause the skull to shatter .
which means not only did this person
want to put the fear of god into gavin ,
but he knew exactly how to do it without killing him .
this poor kid was tortured .
or trained .
what if whoever did this wanted to make sure
if he got caught he &apos;d never talk ?
keep these people back .
if this punk isn &apos;t gonna move on his own , i &apos;ll do it myself .
get back in your car !
sir , come on , let &apos;s go .
get me a tow truck at the intersection of ashland and division .
i have a burgundy toyota ,
illinois plate number
4 @-@ victor @-@ bravo @-@ hotel @-@ sierra @-@ 2 .
what have you got , garcia ?
i was finally able to clean up that grainy mess .
here is our mystery driver .
he can &apos;t be much older than gavin .
they &apos;re dressed exactly the same .
which is why i ran the image through
advanced facial age regression software
and then i cross @-@ referenced it with the statewide database .
our driver is 17 @-@ year @-@ old trevor madison
from arlington heights .
another missing kid ?
yeah . this is where it goes from wack to super wack
with a side of awful .
trevor went missing less than 24 hours after gavin .
and nobody made the connection ?
no . the other cases were in different jurisdictions ,
so there hasn &apos;t been any physical evidence
linking the cases until now .
these kids aren &apos;t runaways . they were abducted .
we got a hit from the apb .
trevor filled up at a gas station
off the interstate a half hour ago .
sounds like someone &apos;s thinking about skipping town .
it &apos;s been hours since the shooting .
he could have made it across state lines by now .
but he stuck around . why ?
one of my officers has just radioed for a tow truck .
the kid has barricaded himself inside the car .
he &apos;s at the intersection ...
evacuate the area .
evacuate the area .
dude , what &apos;s going on ?
all units on site at ashland and division ,
evacuate immediately .
repeat--evacuate immediately .
you guys , back up !
suspect may be armed with ...
back up--
the media &apos;s already running with the story .
they &apos;re calling it an act of terrorism .
we &apos;ll release a statement as soon as we confirm
the source of the explosion .
clayburn says the phones are ringing off the hook .
got every precinct in town looking for answers .
you should reach out to neighboring jurisdictions ,
let them know we &apos;ll update them as soon as we learn more .
these guys have everybody on edge .
nobody feels safe when a cop gets killed .
well , until we catch them , we should all be on high alert .
the explosive used was highly sophisticated .
it was designed specifically for maximum damage .
that &apos;s why he stopped to get gas .
the more fuel , the bigger the boom .
how &apos;d these kids get involved in domestic terrorism ?
whoever abducted gavin and trevor
spent years programming them as soldiers .
when the time was right , they were released
to carry out their captors &apos; mission .
it &apos;s more than likely that these two weren &apos;t the only ones .
it &apos;s possible we &apos;re dealing with a terrorist organization
with one man at the center .
we &apos;re basing our profile on his motivation .
we believe these children were abducted
by a preferential offender who targets prepubescent boys .
our unsub is likely a male in his 40s
with some military or law enforcement training .
we think he has a secluded location
that provides enough privacy
to hold his victims captive for several years .
in that time he breaks these kids down
and rebuilds them to be hardened soldiers .
we believe they &apos;re suffering
from an extreme case of stockholm syndrome .
much like patty hearst ,
who came to view the sla as her new family
and the rest of the world as adversaries .
we believe he &apos;s attempting
to instill this same feeling within his army .
he likely uses military torture techniques
to get his victims to see his enemies as their own .
he puts them through a rigorous
and punishing military training regimen
in order to prepare them
mentally and physically for his war .
once this happens , the physical threats stop
and the reprogramming begins .
and now that he has their trust ,
he maintains this connection by bolstering them
with love and affection .
his connection to them is important .
it ensures once they &apos;re released ,
they will not deviate from their orders .
his ultimate target has yet to be determined ,
but it could be as broad as american citizens .
these attacks have been well orchestrated , methodical ,
and extremely violent in order to maximize destruction and panic .
which is why we need to get ahead of him
in order to prevent more bloodshed .
but in order to do that ,
we need to identify the source of his rage .
who sent you ?
i said ...
who the hell sent you ?
how did i do this time ?
guys , i think i know
why the unsub targeted gavin and trevor .
garcia , are you still there ?
i have now connected 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 missing kids to this unsub .
walk with me through the darkness if you will .
brandon rutherford and vincent gamble--
they disappeared within 24 hours of each other
6 months before gavin and trevor did ,
and then their bodies were found two weeks later .
it &apos;s possible they were his first victims .
but he killed them , so it may not be the same unsub .
the m.e. reports for both brandon and vincent were consistent
with the type of torture gavin suffered ,
but theirs was much more severe .
these two probably rebelled against the unsub &apos;s programming ,
so he got rid of them .
uh , yeah , that brings us to steven walker and daniel morrison .
they were 12 years old
when the were abducted , again , within 24 hours of each other ,
and this happened two years after gavin and trevor disappeared .
steven walker &apos;s body was found a year ago
in a wooded area just outside the city ,
and his injuries were consistent with the other boys &apos; .
all of these kids were high @-@ risk targets .
gavin and trevor ,
they lived in gang territory .
brandon and vincent were street kids .
steven and daniel both came from single @-@ parent homes .
his ruse could be as simple as showing them attention ,
something they may not have received at home .
there &apos;s something known as the magical age , between 9 and 12,
when a child &apos;s psyche is more malleable .
that could be why the unsub changed his victimology .
like the child soldiers being recruited by the rebels in sudan ,
they lack the physical and emotional maturity to resist their captors .
he realized that the younger that he went ,
the easier they would be to control .
brandon was taken at 15 .
maybe he was too old to respond to the unsub &apos;s conditioning .
and daniel was 12 when he was abducted .
so there &apos;s a possibility he &apos;s still alive .
he &apos;d be 15 now .
he &apos;s likely proven himself a good and cooperative soldier .
that submission may have earned him a degree of freedom .
what are you thinking ?
even though he &apos;s a soldier , he &apos;s still a teenager .
so maybe the best way to reach him is through the media .
it &apos;s possible daniel has access to a television ,
maybe even the internet .
once these boys are programmed ,
they &apos;re probably hard to break .
right now it &apos;s all we have .
i don &apos;t know if i can do this .
look at all of them .
i &apos;ve heard those reporters .
they &apos;re wrong . danny is the victim here .
all these boys are .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
if there is any chance that my baby is still alive ...
which is why we need your help in getting through to him .
right now daniel is probably unaware of
how much you love and miss him .
i need you to remind him that you are his family . ok ?
they &apos;re ready .
thank you .
there she is ! ms. morrison !
have you heard from daniel ?
you saw daniel ?
can you tell us anything ?
my name is lauren morrison .
i &apos;m not very good at this .
but i , uh , would like to get a message to my son daniel .
i &apos;m ... so sorry that i wasn &apos;t there to protect you
when you needed me the most .
if you &apos;re out there ...
if you &apos;re listening to this ...
please , danny , i just want you to come home .
i just want you to come home .
that was lauren morrison , whose missing son daniel
is possibly connected to this recent wave of violence .
residents are still being advised to remain vigilant
while a citywide manhunt is in progress .
for further information ,
dial 1 @-@ 800 @-@ 555 @-@ 0199 .
that &apos;s 1 @-@ 8--
hello ?
hello ?
daniel ? baby , is that you ?
danny ?
garcia ?
give me a second .
he &apos;s calling from a disposable cell-- i got it !
i &apos;m sending you the location now .
i got him . northeast corner .
hands where i can see them !
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
danny ... focus on me .
hey . just look at me .
i know you &apos;ve been given your orders .
but i want you to think about your mother for a second .
all she wants is for her son to come home .
daniel , she &apos;s been waiting on you for a long time .
just do this for her .
don &apos;t make her suffer any longer .
give me the bag .
on your knees .
let &apos;s go . up .
my name is derek morgan . i &apos;m with the fbi .
look , i know you &apos;ve been through a lot
these past couple of years ,
but i need you to understand
that everything that man told you is a lie .
my name is daniel james morrison .
i &apos;m a soldier . 53699 .
listen to me , kid .
i need your help to find the person
who is responsible for all of this .
my name is daniel james morrison .
no more innocent people should die
i &apos;m a soldier . 53699 .
because of this man &apos;s cause .
my name is daniel james morrison .
i &apos;m a soldier .
53699 !
it &apos;s all part of the training .
name , rank , and serial number .
i don &apos;t know , most serial numbers have at least 9 digits .
he keeps repeating the same 5,
which means it has some sort of special meaning to the unsub .
maybe it &apos;s a military code of some sort ?
garcia already checked .
came up empty .
he chose today for his attack .
and the only person who knows why isn &apos;t talking .
maybe jj will have more luck .
i know this can &apos;t be easy for you ,
but i need you to keep in mind
that daniel isn &apos;t the same kid .
ok ?
you look so different .
your hair ...
those big blue eyes .
i miss you so much .
god , i wish your grandmother were here to see you .
she passed away a few months ago .
your room &apos;s still the same .
i didn &apos;t change a thing .
i know how you hate for me to touch your stuff .
max is doing good .
he &apos;s gotten older .
i know he misses the walks you used to take him on .
oh , baby ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
if--if i &apos;d have just ...
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t want to overwhelm you .
um , i &apos;m gonna be outside with agent jareau .
with 12 confirmed deaths ,
police have finally been able to make an arrest
in connection with the recent string of deadly attacks .
sources close to the investigation believe
daniel morrison
is linked to not only last night &apos;s shooting massacre
at a popular local diner ,
but also the car explosion
that rocked the downtown area earlier this morning .
the questions on everyone &apos;s mind :
how could children be at the center of such tragedy ?
and where do they go from here ?
we &apos;re going to be speaking to child psychologist marty walton--
all right , let &apos;s look at victimology again .
first attack , the diner . victims across the board .
second attack , car bombing .
same goal--take out as many victims as possible .
third attack , attempted mass shooting ,
but on a much bigger scale .
god knows how many people he would have killed .
what if it &apos;s not about the attack itself
but what happened leading up to them ?
officer clayburn entered that diner
just minutes before the shooting .
but the explosive was detonated
just moments after the traffic cop radioed for help .
and as soon as daniel saw reyes ...
his whole demeanor changed .
they &apos;re targeting chicago p.d.
they forced our hand .
now , we &apos;re gonna have to teach them a lesson they &apos;ll never forget .
how did gavin know
that there would be a cop in the diner at that exact moment ?
chicago has over 13,000 police officers .
that &apos;s roughly 60 per square mile .
there are two precincts within a 4 @-@ block radius of the diner .
my guess is it was only a matter of time before a cop walked in .
and if it was his mission ,
he was probably prepared to wait all night if he had to .
it wasn &apos;t a coincidence
the attack happened shortly after the night shift ended .
they learned the routines , planned ahead .
well , that brings us back to square one .
the list of people that have problems
with law enforcement is a long one .
we &apos;re looking at everyone from organized crime to ex @-@ cons .
if it was an ex @-@ con , the target would likely be more specific ,
like the arresting officer .
guys , i think the 5 @-@ digit number daniel &apos;s reciting
is a police badge number .
garcia .
talk to me .
run 53699 against a list of chicago p.d.
running it as fast as bytes will carry .
53699 ... i got a hit !
53699 is the badge number to a former officer wayne gulino .
everything we &apos;ve worked for all these years ,
it &apos;s come to this moment .
make me proud .
gulino was an air force sergeant .
he served two tours in iraq .
when he came home he joined the chicago p.d.
7 years ago today , he and his partner george scotman
had their badges stripped
for brutally coercing confessions out of suspects .
a fellow rookie officer filed a report .
that led to an internal affairs investigation .
and that rookie cop who blew the whistle
was none other than one detective mark reyes .
all right , garcia ,
send us everything you &apos;ve got on gulino and the partner .
gulino was defined by his badge ,
and when he felt wronged by his own kind ,
the love turned to hate .
blake , go talk to reyes , see what you can find out .
the rest of us will go to gulino &apos;s residence .
detective , can i speak with you for a moment ?
sure .
any new leads ?
i need you to tell me everything you know
about officer wayne gulino .
it says here that gulino &apos;s partner
scotman died 4 years ago of cancer .
brandon and vincent were abducted 4 weeks after scotman died .
his death had to be the trigger .
and today marks the seventh anniversary
of when gulino was let go from the force .
hey , has anyone seen peterson ?
yeah , i think he &apos;s down in evidence .
ok , so he chose today to launch his attacks ,
make his big statement against the police force .
and by now he knows that we have daniel ,
so it &apos;s only a matter of time before we find him .
i &apos;m looking for detective mark reyes .
attention , eyes up . we got a code 10 .
i &apos;m detective reyes .
officer gulino has a message for you .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
shoot me and this whole place goes up .
everybody holster your weapons .
holster your weapons .
my name &apos;s jennifer . what &apos;s your name ?
my name is stephanie lawford .
i &apos;m a soldier . 53699 .
i understand you have your orders ,
but can we talk just a moment ?
it &apos;s time for you
to hear the words of a true american hero .
hero ?
officer wayne gulino .
what kind of hero sends children to fight his battles ?
this is directed at my former brothers @-@ in @-@ arms ,
the chicago police department ,
who betrayed me , and in doing so ,
betrayed the very honor code you all swore to uphold ....
a hero isn &apos;t someone who
abuses their power and hurts innocent people .
because of your reprehensible actions , my late partner ,
the brave officer george scotman died ...
you &apos;re just his patsy . you mean nothing to him .
sweetie ,
as an unsung hero ,
you &apos;re just a number .
without the honor he deserved .
i can assure you , our legacy will live on forever .
this isn &apos;t a legacy . gulino is a coward .
everything we worked for
in our careers had led me to this moment .
now that you &apos;ve had a taste of our righteous vengeance ,
be warned , this is just the beginning .
suspect down !
bomb still active !
call the bomb squad !
stay back . stay back .
all right , thanks , garcia .
apparently stephanie had been missing for a little over 6 years .
she &apos;s been with him the longest .
maybe he thought having a maternal figure
would help condition the boys faster .
that was hotch .
they searched both locations for gulino . he &apos;s gone .
stephanie was just a distraction to buy him some time .
well , this isn &apos;t over yet .
he said it himself -- this is only the beginning .
well , if he continues in military fashion ,
he &apos;ll withdraw from the failed mission and regroup .
the question is , where &apos;s his foxhole ?
&quot; my late partner , the brave officer george scotman ,
died as an unsung hero . &quot;
this is as much about his partner as it is about gulino .
yeah , baby girl , send us the last known address
for gulino &apos;s partner , officer scotman .
don &apos;t move .
put your hands where i can see them .
put &apos; em up .
are you all right ?
yeah .
come on .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
if you can &apos;t afford an attorney ,
one will be provided to you by the court .
do you understand these rights that i &apos;ve just read you ?
come here .
there you go .
what &apos;s your name ?
my name is cameron patterson .
i &apos;m a soldier .
53699 .
is that what he told you to say ?
cameron , you don &apos;t have to say that ever again . ok ?
we &apos;re gonna take you to your mom and dad .
&quot; the greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse . &quot;
edmund burke .
i know , mom .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right ,
the least i could have done is call .
it -- it won &apos;t happen again , i swear .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s open .
what &apos;s going on ?
hey . we &apos;ve only been dating a few months ,
so i know i didn &apos;t miss an anniversary .
i just wanted to do something special for you .
how did you know i was going to be home ?
sit .
penelope sent me a text when you guys left chicago .
oh , she did ?
and you did all of this for me ?
yes .
and ...
i made you ...
this .
which is why takeout will be here in 20 minutes .
i hope you like indian .
anything is better than whatever that is .
i know . it &apos;s kind of bad .
how was your day ? did you save some lives ?
we both did .
yeah , we did .
so , um ...
