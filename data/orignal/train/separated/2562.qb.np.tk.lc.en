hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
lose the shovel .
keep your hands where i can see them .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re going to be so pretty .

i had the photo enhanced .
it &apos;s a rough extrapolation of features
since the face was almost entirely blown out .
i ran it through every fbi database
from facial recognition , mug shots , surveillance feeds --
or i could just buy this boat , and we could disappear .

do you know how many images are in the ngi database ?
51 million .
if we go away , none of that matters .
51 million , and not a single one of her .
reddington knows who she is .
i know who she is .
that girl -- that &apos;s me .
and the woman -- i believe that may be my mother .
that mean reddington &apos;s your dad ?
no .
my father died when i was 4 , in a fire .
reddington was there .
i think she may have been , too .
why don &apos;t you just ask him ?
if reddington wanted me to know the truth ,
he would have told me by now .
he wants to keep me from knowing ,
and he will bully anyone who might help me into silence .
well , that &apos;s his tell -- the silence .
berlin had me keep tabs on him , or try to .
the mere mention of his name
was like i &apos;d asked for their first born .
he thinks the fear protects him ,
but the fear he instills --
silence can &apos;t hide it .
you can see it in their eyes .
whenever i did ,
i knew reddington had been there .
what ?
that stamp .
the ... ring -- i &apos;ve seen it before .
where ?
berlin .
he wore a ring with that exact hallmark .
it &apos;s a russian inspection stamp .
you know people who worked with berlin .
you could reach out .
my apologies , leonard . i intended to be earlier .
you had a bullet removed from your chest five days ago .
it &apos;s a wonder you &apos;re here at all .
i &apos;ve configured an optical character recognition program
to create hard copies of the data of the fulcrum .
that data &apos;s over 25 years old . much of it must be obsolete .
most of the key delegations are run by the same players .
the director believes there are too many players on the board .
he thinks a bipolar world is inherently more stable .
whatever they &apos;re planning to accomplish ,
it won &apos;t commence until 2017 .
well , he &apos;s advancing the timeline .
and with hobbs gone , i &apos;ve lost my man on the inside .
we need to find kenneth jasper .
he &apos;s one of the director &apos;s closest allies .
he &apos;ll know what they &apos;re planning .
i threatened to kill him when he betrayed roger hobbes .
more specifically , i threatened to cut out his tongue
and deliver it to the director personally .
he won &apos;t be easy to find .
but he &apos;s the best play .
swanky digs .
seeing as how you recently paid a visit
to my apartment in bethesda ,
you know i have a fondness for the old and somewhat decrepit .
dembe asked me to go to get the interface for the fulcrum .
he needed you to get the fulcrum .
he wanted you to discover secrets .
did you discover any secrets , lizzy ?
what &apos;s that ?
please , help yourself .
identification documents for lien mah .
fake birth certificate . fake passport .
death certificate .
proof of embalming .
everything necessary to convince the u.s. state department
that lien mah was a chinese national
who died while visiting the united states
and to arrange for her body &apos;s return to her homeland .
who would ship a fictitious chinese corpse to china ?
a rather clever smuggler , i imagine .
so , if lien mah is fake ,
then whose body are they shipping overseas ?
&quot; marjorie lin , 24 , was laid to rest monday afternoon .
not 10 hours later , her body was stolen
in a brazen midnight grave robbery . &quot;
you think the smuggler is using marjorie lin &apos;s body ?
compare the photo on lien mah &apos;s false passport
to the photo of marjorie lin in the paper .
same woman .
but why this case ? what &apos;s your angle ?
this smuggler also has business with the cabal .
the cabal ?
the taiwan festival bombing in 2011 .
32 dead , 9 injured .
the i.e.d. that took out the convoy
headed to the chinese consulate in jakarta last year --
another 17 dead .
both were engineered by the cabal .
and this same smuggler was used to transport
those explosives to their final destinations .
you want to target one of their assets ?
i went to the director ,
showed him the fulcrum , restored the détente .
the détente is over , lizzy .
what you know about the fulcrum --
what the director now knows you know --
by saving me , you revealed yourself
to be a potent enemy ,
a target they will try to discredit or destroy .
the smuggler . we need to find the smuggler .
so , we obtained a list from state
of all the foreign nationals who died on u.s. soil
and were repatriated back to their home countries .
of these , seven in particular stood out .
how so ?
their passports were forged
using fictitious names just like the documentation
that mr. reddington provided on marjorie lin .
and who were these women , really ?
marjorie lin , a.k.a. lien mah ,
wasn &apos;t the only body that was stolen .
we were able to match the seven forged photographs
with seven grave robberies
in which the bodies were asian females under 35 --
chinese , to be specific .
and all of them were shipped back to various cities in china .
do we know who received the shipments on the other end ?
i contacted the chinese authorities .
they &apos;re launching an investigation .
i doubt they &apos;ll come up with much .
i mean , given the elaborately forged paper trails ,
my bet is these funeral parlors don &apos;t even exist .
based on this guy &apos;s track record ,
there &apos;s a good chance he was moving explosives
in those caskets .
and we &apos;ll find out .
as soon as our suspect files the paperwork
authorizing the transportation of lien mah back to china ,
we &apos;ll know the flight number ,
and we can go seize the casket and see for ourselves .
that &apos;s enough for today .
just one more lap , raymond .
this is an important part of your therapy .
you should have let me die , dembe .
nobody told me about this aimless walking .
jasper &apos;s gone .
how gone ?
canceled all meetings and fled in his gulfstream four days ago .
bogus flight plan . no record of any visas issued .
not as much as a passport swiped .
dembe , call alex and barton .
book them a flight to key west .
jasper &apos;s yacht is docked at the admiral &apos;s club marina --
a banetti romanza .
arrevderci bella .
barton can pass for jasper from a distance .
go aboard , take her out a mile or two ,
blow her up .
dembe will make it appear to be a death by misadventure .
tip off frasier at the journal
and brenda short at holford capital .
stock in jasper &apos;s conglomerate , century view media ,
will start hemorrhaging as soon as news
of his tragic disappearance goes viral .
within hours , he &apos;ll have to hold a press conference
to stem the bleeding .
and then we &apos;ll have his location ,
or at least a starting point .
and if he decides to ride it out ?
he has two viciously rapacious ex @-@ wives ,
a brazilian bull shark of a mistress ,
and a thoroughbred ranch south of ocala
that &apos;s a bottomless money pit .
he &apos;ll turn up .
if you &apos;re gonna keep stopping by like this ,
perhaps we should consider getting you an office .
i &apos;m getting sworn in tomorrow , harold .
i &apos;m aware . big day .
you &apos;re damn right .
and i &apos;ve been getting calls from
the times , from the post .
there were witnesses .
people think it was reddington who was shot .
people know it was him .
we can deal with rumors .
what &apos;s harder to deal with is proof ,
and there isn &apos;t any .
the press believes a fugitive from the fbi &apos;s most want list
was here in d.c.
and it looks like i don &apos;t know anything about it .
it gives the impression
i &apos;m more focused on transitioning into the job
than doing the job .
i want this handled .
how do you suggest i do that ?
there &apos;s a reporter at the post .
his name is josh mandell .
i want you to leak him something ,
anything .
a redacted operational report to reven wright --
just enough to convey that my office and the fbi
are all over the reddington case .
you &apos;re asking me to fabricate and then leak
a classified document .
yes .
it &apos;s public relations , harold .
lien mah &apos;s body was just delivered to dulles .
the casket &apos;s scheduled to be on flight 241 to beijing .
contact airport authority . stop that flight .
make sure the casket doesn &apos;t make it to the cargo hold .
get an e.o.d. team to meet us on site .
i just heard from reddington . uh , he wants to meet .
about what ?
he won &apos;t say . he &apos;s still worried about leaks .
i &apos;ll have to catch up with you later .
our preliminary x @-@ rays didn &apos;t reveal
any explosive material
or objects with a density
common to c @-@ 4 or other incendiary plastics .
we won &apos;t know what we got for sure till we get inside .
to be safe , we &apos;re gonna let the robot crack it .
that &apos;s definitely marjorie lin .
interior looks clear .
that &apos;s not possible .
our intel says that something &apos;s being smuggled
out of the country in that casket .
what if what we &apos;re looking for isn &apos;t in the casket ?
what if he &apos;s brazen enough
to hide the contraband in the body itself ?
we &apos;re not gonna open that body .
no one here wants to put this woman through
anything more than she &apos;s already endured ,
but i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re going to have to insist .
you know ,
when i was a , uh -- when i was a kid ,
i wanted to race motorcycles , and my mom said ,
&quot; no , jeffrey . go into medicine .
it &apos;s safe . &quot;
thanks a lot , mom .
all right . here we go . helmet on .
okay , yeah .
okay .
okay . definitely should not have had tuna for lunch .
wish me luck .
okay .
here we go . nice and easy .
nice ... and easy .
all right .
okay , i &apos;m gonna open her up by
cutting along the path of the previous incision .
here we go .
i &apos;m in .
all of the internal organs appear normal , post @-@ embalmment .
nothing here appears to be out of the ordinary .
she &apos;s clean . in fact , she &apos;s immaculate .
this is one of the most impeccably preserved bodies
i have ever seen .
we &apos;re clear .
did the same thing last month .
it &apos;s probably why you don &apos;t recognize me .
konstantin .
berlin , man , he &apos;s tough .
i had to get away for a while ,
go to germany , figure a few things out .
i come here for the peace and quiet .
sure . sorry .
gosh , you know , i just thought maybe you could help me .
he said to piss off , pal .
just take a minute .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
i think you do .
why don &apos;t you take another look ?
we got a problem .
let him go !
you okay ?
yeah .
i believe he was asking for a name .
i can &apos;t . i swore on my life i wouldn &apos;t .
you sore to whom ?
son of a bitch .
who &apos;s bill kershaw ?
where is it ? i know it &apos;s here .
that &apos;s how you knew i was here ,
how you knew i saw the picture .
it &apos;s why you threated people .
the important thing is for our stockholders to understad
that i am alive and well .
and we understand
that you &apos;ve lined up a series of interviews
so that you can reassure ...
call hollenbeck in boston .
i want a surveillance team outside that station
when jasper leaves .
i suppose we should find out from dr. renovitch
if i &apos;m cleared to fly .
where are you ? where are you ? where are you ?
raymond .
... want to be reassured that company is stable .
hello , mr. kershaw .
i saw your name on the mailbox .
i know you &apos;re listening . you know how i know ?
because this
is where you keep all of your secrets .
and you don &apos;t want anyone finding those out , do you ?
well , unless you answer my questions ,
i &apos;m gonna find every last one .
let me have your phone .
you &apos;ve made your point , agent keen .
it &apos;s time we discuss the photograph .
the girl is you .
and the woman is your mother .
what was her name ?
i knew her as katarina rostova .
one of her many names .
she was a kgb agent .
the girl ...
the night of the fire , they called her --
masha .
you were born in moscow .
your parents -- uh , father and --
they were both in foreign intelligence .
you said she died of weakness and shame .
yeah .
you were there that night . i need to know what happened .
you want to know .
there &apos;s a difference .
dr. orchard told me someone blocked my memory of that night .
was it you ?
yes .
why ?
i &apos;m not going to tell you .
you have a picture of my mother in your weird , little apartment .
why ?
were you in love with her ?
is that why my father died ?
you killed him because you were in love with my mother ?
tell me what happened . please .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you what happened , lizzy .
then i &apos;ll find out for myself .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
tom connolly
wants me to leak intel to the press .
what kind of intel ?
classified .
i should have said no ,
but i get the distinct impression
that my position in this clinical trial
is contingent on doing him favors .
so , do them .
i mean , don &apos;t people leak information all the time ?
you hear what i said ?
he &apos;s leveraging my health , my life .
harold , you &apos;re a decent man
the man i fell in love with ,
and now you &apos;re asked to do something indecent .
but if you are telling me that your life depends on
whether tom connolly gets what he wants ,
you know my opinion .
i do .
and you know mine .
reddington said that the smugglers facilitated
several terrorist incidents in the past .
he had to have been transporting something in that casket .
well , it wasn &apos;t drugs or explosives .
maybe it was the stolen bodies themselves .
guys , come here . check this out .
the photo on the left was taken by the coroner
who pronounced marjorie lin dead five days ago .
the one on the right was taken at the airport yesterday .
notice anything ?
their teeth are different .
bingo .
when she died , marjorie lin didn &apos;t have veneers .
her teeth were fixed postmortem ?
that is not easy to pull off , given the time frame .
process normally takes weeks .
ms. lin &apos;s body was only taken two days ago .
according to danover labs ,
the order was delivered to a dr. henry mcglasson .
now , i dug a little deeper into this guy
and contacted the medical board .
they did have an address -- 3230 kettering drive .
how &apos;d it go with reddington ? did he have any insights ?
no . but i did .
my face is out there .
i &apos;ve done five interviews in the last four hours .
the reporting has been corrected .
it &apos;ll just take time for the share price to recover .
the front desk called . the radio people are here .
put theelan on it .
tell him to flog his boy from the s.e.c. and get it done !
we &apos;ll be wheels up again in two hours .
i &apos;ll do the video uplink in the air .
hello , kenneth !
regrettably , your interview has been canceled ,
but don &apos;t fret .
i &apos;m quite certain my questions will be much more provocative .
fbi . hands where i can see them .
you &apos;re standing in front of a ghost bride .
come again . a what ?
it &apos;s an outlawed folk custom .
a chinese form of ancestor worship .
when a family member dies , the surviving relatives
are obligated to tend to that person &apos;s needs in the afterlife .
and if they die unmarried ,
they &apos;ll find themselves alone on the other side .
and unhappy spirits tend to come back
and haunt their living relatives .
well , what are the paper dolls for ?
the ceremony .
the family crafts a doll for the deceased groom , as well .
after which , the female &apos;s remains
are buried alongside the deceased male .
believe it or not , even with all the women in china ,
young , attractive , unmarried female corpses are rare ,
which would explain why our suspect
was exporting bodies from the u.s.
i &apos;m sorry , but this guy digs up bodies in america ,
and then he sends them back to china to be re @-@ buried ?
mail @-@ order corpse brides .
selected based on age , lineage , education , attractiveness .
and that explains the veneers .
this one was clearly crafted to resemble marjorie lin .
same general features , but it begs the question --
who &apos;s this one ?
they &apos;re gonna steal another body .
agent navabi , i imagine you &apos;re knee @-@ deep
in pilfered corpses at the moment ,
but right now i require a woman
with your particular experience and training .
what ?
there must be over $ 100,000 in this case .
heads up , kenneth .
i &apos;m afraid i mean quite literay .
i &apos;m gonna need you to keep your head up for this next part .
it &apos;s bad news , old boy . i know .
a few days ago , i offered to crown you king ,
and now here you sit .
well , the road not taken .
this is agent navabi .
she was trained by mossad
in enhanced interrogation techniques .
i thought you two should have a little visit .
why don &apos;t we get started ?
i analyzed the money you found in the ceiling tile
and found a couple of anomalies .
turns out the cash is worth a lot more
than the 100 grand the bills represent .
how is that even possible ?
all the serial numbers start with a888,
and none of them include the number 4 .
in , uh , cantonese and most regional chinese dialects ,
the word for &quot; four &quot; sounds like the chinese word for &quot; death . &quot;
so , fours are unlucky .
what does that have to do with the bills ?
it is statistically impossible to have this many bills
and not have any fours ,
unless , of course , the bills were printed specifically
without any fours .
so you &apos;re saying that they &apos;re counterfeit .
i &apos;m saying they &apos;re prosperity notes ,
worth about 5 bucks to every dollar .
and there &apos;s only one place you can buy an entire batch of currency
with this sort of customized detail .
whoever paid the suspect
bought the prosperity notes from the u.s. treasury .
if we can trace who bought the bills ,
we might be able to i.d. the next client .
i already contacted the treasury .
the buyer was one mr. chaoxiang han .
uh , kenda .
uh , i looked into this guy , and -- thanks so much --
and we found this article published last february .
&quot; mr. and mrs. chaoxiang han
mourned the loss of only son jin ,
the heir apparent to the han tech empire ,
worth billions . &quot;
says he committed suicide after he was left at the altar
by his fiancee , an bai ,
after which she emigrated to d.c. to live with her father .
he works at the embassy .
she &apos;s currently attending georgetown .
an bai is the next victim .
uh , wait , but isn &apos;t she supposed to already be dead ?
isn &apos;t that how this works ?
uh , the parents must blame her for jin &apos;s suicide .
they &apos;re determined to make an bai his bride ,
if not in life , then in death .
you two head to an bai &apos;s .
get me the security office at georgetown .
oh , my goodness .
remember that fantastic film
from the &apos; 70s -- &quot; marathon man &quot; ?
oh , my god , what a film .
laurence olivier as the ex @-@ nazi
super @-@ bad guy / dentist .
and dustin hoffman as --
uh , i think he was a graduate student , wasn &apos;t he ?
anyway , that interrogation scene --
oh , my gosh .
olivier drilling into hoffman &apos;s teeth
right down into the nerve .
oh , god , i can just feel it !
the screaming and writhing , the sound of the drill .
and of course , hoffman delirious with pain ,
saying anything , true or not ,
just to stop the excruciating nightmare .
&quot; is it safe ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s safe . &quot;
&quot; is it safe ? &quot; &quot; no , no , it &apos;s not safe ! &quot;
you know , he &apos;d say anything .
and then that , uh , uh , guy comes in -- what &apos;s his name ?
the -- with the great teeth and that hair --
anyway , nothing much comes of it .
hoffman doesn &apos;t know anything , but what a scene .
unfortunately , nothing quite so dramatic today .
we &apos;re gonna be a little more businesslike .
that novocaine agent navabi just gave you
should be starting to kick in right about now .
so , here &apos;s our plan .
you &apos;re gonna tell us what sort of mass @-@ casualty event
or events the director is planning .
either you answer our questions ,
or we &apos;re gonna yank out all your teeth today .
i told you . i don &apos;t know .
the director never spoke of his plans with me .
i &apos;m not in the loop on operational details .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i offered you an opportunity
to elevate your position within the cabal , kenneth .
you declined and instead remained loyal to the director .
i assumed you had greater aspirations ,
but you don &apos;t , do you , kenneth ?
you rejected my offer because , as it turns out ,
you &apos;re quite satisfied with your station .
that &apos;s how i know you &apos;re one of the primary decision makers .
clearly , you are very much in the loop .
you don &apos;t understand my loyalty , do you ?
because you have nothing in your life
worth staying loyal to .
william devane !
it was william devane
with those marvelous teeth and that great hair !
ohh , i love william devane .
anyway , that said ,
dentistry makes me a little queasy ,
so i &apos;ll leave you and my lovely associate
to the business at hand .
look at me .
sir , we don &apos;t have much time .
we need to move quickly before he comes back .
i have orders from the director to get you out of here .
stay behind me and keep quiet .
stop !
get in the car . go .
i &apos;ve scrambled the local p.d. to an bai &apos;s house .
they should get there before you do .
were you able to reach her ?
no answer on her cell .
i &apos;m gonna try her on her home line now .
for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
corinthians .
where are we going ?
i have orders to take you to the director .
i was aware we had someone on the inside ,
but i just didn &apos;t know who .
well , i &apos;m not on the inside anymore .
i just blew my cover to save you .
it took me nine months to get reddington
and that damn task force to trust me .
look , the director won &apos;t take any chances .
if he thinks i &apos;ve divulged any information in their plans ,
i am done .
i need you to make it clear that i didn &apos;t break .
i wasn &apos;t there the entire time .
i don &apos;t know what you said before reddington brought me in .
nothing . that &apos;s why reddington brought you in .
he knows the director is advancing the timeline .
he knows that the plan is to trigger a series of events
that will bring us to the brink of another world war .
i didn &apos;t tell him that . it was leonard caul .
reddington has the fulcrum ,
which means he has a blueprint outlining
our entire infrastructure .
if you leaked operational details , we &apos;re done .
i didn &apos;t . i don &apos;t even have those details .
i know we &apos;re targeting a defense installation ,
but i don &apos;t know which one .
i &apos;m serious !
the director won &apos;t finalize his choice until next week .
then you have nothing to worry about .
why are we ... ?
where are you taking me ? this isn &apos;t ...
in corinthians ,
satan wasn &apos;t transformed into an angel of light .
he was disguised as one .
don &apos;t look so glum , kenneth .
you just spent 10 minutes being ridden hard by agent navab .
i &apos;d die for five .
hello ?
ms. bai ?
my name is aram mojtabai , and i &apos;m an agent with the fbi .
we have reason to believe you &apos;re in danger .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ll explain , but first ,
i need you to find a secure room in your house .
make sure all the doors and windows are locked .
the police are on their way ,
and i &apos;m gonna stay on the line until they arrive .
ms. bai . hello ?
ms. bai ? hello ? hello , are you still there ?
ms. bai ?
53 to dispatch . we &apos;re here at the location .
doesn &apos;t seem to be anyone home .
hang on .
hands ! show me hands !
step out of the car .
you don &apos;t have any idea what you &apos;ve done , do you ?
you &apos;re the one charged with a dozen felonies , mr. zhang .
you &apos;re the one who almost took a woman &apos;s life today .
and how many lives did you take ?
this tradition in chinese culture
that you think is just some ghost story
with no basis in the real world .
but this -- this is the real world .
you were in a fire ?
my older brother died when he was only 27 .
i &apos;m sorry .
my brother -- he was unmarried .
and in the years to follow ,
he haunted my family from the grave .
my father worked for the same factory for 32 years .
they closed down four months after my brother &apos;s death .
and the bad luck that followed was ...
our home was destroyed by a catastrophic fire .
my mother and father did not survive .
i sat with my mother in the hospital the day she passed .
saw the fear in her eyes .
she said , &quot; you know why this happened .
it will never stop until you appease your brother . &quot;
so that night ,
i stole the body of a young woman from our village ,
buried her alongside my brother .
a wife for him , a husband for her in the next life .
and from that day on , the bad luck was gone .
just like my brother haunted me ,
jin han haunts his parents now .
because of you , he &apos;s not appeased .
and now he will bring bad luck
to those who have denied his happiness in the next life .
that includes you and your fellow agents .
we know you don &apos;t work exclusively
as an independent operator .
your skill as an international smuggler
has made you quite valuable .
valuable ? to who ?
to an organization some call the cabal .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
you may not know the name ,
but you know who hired you to procure the weapon
used in the taiwanese festival bombing .
or the convoy hit in jakarta .
i &apos;m listening .
there &apos;s going to be an attack on u.s. soil next week .
you were contracted to bring an item into the country ,
something we believe will be instrumental in that attack .
we need to know what it is and when it &apos;s coming .
you &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;re not wrong . we know you were contracted .
not about that .
i was called to arrange a delivery .
but not for an item .
it was an agent -- the one they call karakurt .
karakurt ? who is that ?
and he &apos;s not arriving next week .
he &apos;s already here .
you see , agent keen ,
your bad luck is already beginning .
i need a minute .
i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m not leaking classified data , not for you , not for anybody .
you &apos;re out ? out of what ?
whatever the hell kind of game it is you and i are playing .
you know i &apos;m ill .
i came to you for help , as a friend .
and i thought that you offered that help as a friend .
i did .
enough games , tom .
you used it to leverage me ,
to hold it over my head as a way to guarantee my assistance
whenever you decide you need it .
you think i pulled strings trying to save your life
for my own personal benefit ?
look me in the eye and tell me i &apos;m wrong .
oh , i &apos;ll do better than that , harold .
i &apos;ll look you in the eye and tell you you &apos;re not even close .
the situation is much , much worse than you think .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i helped you to get close , to get leverage , but not for me .
buddy , come on . we &apos;re done with the games .
i &apos;m sure a smart guy like you
can guess who &apos;s calling my plays .
the cabal .
a quaint term that no one actually involved
would ever use .
why me ?
if you ...
guys are as powerful as i &apos;m told ,
what the hell do you need me for ?
all in good time , harold .
what matters now is that you realize one key thing ...
that you understand it and internalize it
with every fiber of your being .
and that is ?
we own you .
you perjured yourself to protect agent keen .
you broke federal law
by disclosing the timeline of a pending indictment .
if that weren &apos;t enough ,
a classified document was leaked today to the post .
i told you i won &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re not understanding me , harold .
it &apos;s already done .
it seems your wife doesn &apos;t share your ethical principles .
you wouldn &apos;t do it ,
so charlene made the hard decision for you .
that &apos;s how much she loves you .
god knows my wife wouldn &apos;t commit any felonies for my behalf .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re thinking up all of the moves you have left .
careful .
the people i speak for won &apos;t hesitate to hurt you
or her if they need to .
so , what now ?
like i said , all will soon be revealed .
come on .
i think they &apos;re , uh , almost ready to start .
a package arrived for you . it was flagged by security .
i think you need to see it for yourself .
i had a little chat with jasper today .
turns out he wasn &apos;t very good at holding his tongue ,
so i thought i &apos;d give you a shot at it .
&quot; i , thomas p. connolly , solemnly swear ... &quot;
i , thomas p. connolly , do solemnly swear ...
... that i will support and defend the constitution
of the united states of america . &quot;
... constitution of the united states of america .
you &apos;ve reached elizabeth keen .
please leave your message at the tone .
come in .
you want to talk about it ?
