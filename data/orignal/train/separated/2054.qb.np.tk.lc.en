pursuant to section 28 @-@ b of the bylaws ,
i am placing harvey specter on immediate unpaid suspension .
that vote &apos;s not gonna go well for you .
you need to do something to humble yourself .
what is this ?
portfolio of business i want you to take
to pearson specter for me .
i &apos;m not doing it .
am i mistaken , or did we not have this discussion ?
don &apos;t call me again .
daniel hardman &apos;s office .
i need to speak to him right now .
he sent two packages . either move forward
on one of them or he &apos;ll move forward on the other .
rachel , you have to handle this meeting by yourself .
what ?
she knows that i didn &apos;t go to law school .
i &apos;m calling the da &apos;s office right now
if you don &apos;t tell me what the hell &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re engaged .
so it is him .
please , i am begging you .
it &apos;s done .
she bought it ?
she did .
you think i should stop being a lawyer ?
i &apos;m saying if you really love her , you won &apos;t marry her .
what are you doing ?
just looking at how beautiful you are .
i already said yes , so you don &apos;t have to--
what got into you this morning ?
sometimes i just think about how we got to be here together .
then i wonder if i deserve you .
and then i wish that we could just stay here in this bed
for the rest of my life .
so do i.
does--does this have anything to do
with the close call we had ?
it does .
i just don &apos;t think i ever thanked you enough for ...
having my back .
don &apos;t you know by now that i will always have your back ?
i do .
harvey , no matter how this goes , we don &apos;t show weakness ,
we don &apos;t show division , and we don &apos;t take it out on louis .
well , that &apos;s gonna be tough , because we wouldn &apos;t even be here
if it wasn &apos;t for that conniving son of a bitch .
harvey , louis came to me last night ,
said he was gonna flip his vote .
so forgive him or not , don &apos;t antagonize him .
there &apos;s still a chance you could get out of this .
good morning , everyone .
harvey , before we vote , would you like to say something ?
i would .
as far as the official purpose of this vote ,
i &apos;m not gonna insult any of you by lying to you .
i hit louis , and i apologized to him in private ,
but what i haven &apos;t done is apologize to all of you .
my compensation has always been important to me .
not for the money , but for what it says
about my place in the firm .
but this isn &apos;t a firm . it &apos;s a partnership .
and my partners are more important to me than money .
so , starting today , i &apos;m reducing my compensation
to the median amount ,
with the rest going to all my partners to share .
and i &apos;m doing this regardless of how you vote today .
thank you for listening .
louis , would you like to present an opposing view ?
let &apos;s just get this over with .
okay . we &apos;ll do this by secret ballot .
the final vote
is eight for suspension , eight against ,
which means the motion will not carry .
therefore , harvey will not be suspended .
now , if no one has anything else ,
i would like to get back to business .
actually , i would like to propose
a new piece of business .
daniel hardman just signed a billion @-@ dollar client ...
what ?
and in exchange for sharing that client with us ,
he &apos;d like to return to the firm on a trial basis .
there is no way daniel hardman is setting foot in this office .
of course you &apos;d think that , because that would mean
more money for the rest of us .
are you kidding me ? i just showed everyone here
i don &apos;t care about money .
you just showed us that you &apos;ll do anything
to get out of a suspension , including bribing the partners .
well , you may have fooled half of us ,
but the other half didn &apos;t buy it .
that &apos;s enough . daniel hardman will not return
to this firm under any circumstance .
and of course you back harvey .
this is not about harvey . this is about my firm .
it &apos;s always about harvey and it &apos;s clear to everyone here ,
whatever he does is fine with you ,
from hitting another partner
to turning down millions for this firm .
you two @-@ faced piece of shit .
why don &apos;t we let the partners decide ?
i don &apos;t have to let the partners decide ,
because this is my decision ,
and my decision is , this god damn meeting is adjourned !
how the hell did you get up here ?
carl downstairs and i go back .
well , you can take carl back where you came from .
because you need an appointment to be here .
i have something i need to deliver to harvey .
then i suggest you leave it with his secretary , gretchen .
&quot; his secretary , gretchen . &quot; now , there &apos;s three words
i never thought i &apos;d hear you say .
ooh . how long has it been
since harvey dumped you onto louis &apos;s desk ?
how long has it been since i slapped you in the face ?
because that is all i can think about right now .
promises , promises .
if you &apos;re here to take back your old office , daniel ,
don &apos;t break out the measuring tape just yet ,
because your plan to worm your way in just failed .
so you can walk your ass out the same way you walked in .
louis , it &apos;s so fascinating seeing you and harvey
united like this after all you must have been through .
what are you talking about ?
her .
i see you finally got the better of him on something .
i didn &apos;t get the better of him on anything .
there &apos;s no daylight between us .
now get the hell out of here .
and do it quick before i have to call security
to tell them i &apos;m beating the shit out of you .
no need .
since you &apos;re not interested in what i have to say ,
i &apos;ll go see jessica .
and just between us chickens ,
there &apos;s a chasm of daylight between you two .
hey , how &apos;s pearson specter &apos;s newest partner ?
are you talking about me or daniel hardman ?
news travels fast .
it does when it &apos;s news about a lying sack of shit .
mike , i would hope that a partner with his eye
on the future would be more forgiving .
you mean a partner that owes you .
you &apos;re not here about daniel . you &apos;re here about me .
you &apos;re goddamn right i am .
you promoted me just to get harvey to trust you
so you could set him up .
no i didn &apos;t .
bullshit .
no , bullshit is a gifted lawyer being held down
by partners to whom he &apos;s pledged his loyalty .
which brings me back to what i just said a minute ago .
you think you bought my loyalty .
mike , you can pick whatever side you want ,
but when the dust settles ,
and harvey and jessica are gone ,
there &apos;ll be a place for you here because i respect you .
let me tell you something , jack .
when the dust settles ,
you &apos;re gonna be the one begging for a place ,
and i &apos;m gonna be the one recommending they throw you out .
you really should try one of those standing desks .
it &apos;s better on the back for a woman of your age .
this is a standing desk for a man of your height .
nice to see you , jessica .
no , it isn &apos;t .
and the last time i saw you ,
i told you to stay the hell away from my firm .
and a good lawyer puts aside their feelings
when there &apos;s money on the table .
oh , cut the shit , daniel . second you get your foot
in the door , you &apos;ll start hatching a plan
to put me on the street .
you &apos;re right .
but thanks to you , the partners will put you
on the street anyway .
what the hell are you talking about ?
the client i was willing to share with you
is looking to make numerous acquisitions ,
and those acquisitions would have been new clients for you too .
instead , we &apos;re going to start targeting your clients
as acquisitions , and everyone we close
leaves you and comes right over to me .
and now all the partners will know why it &apos;s happening .
and your puppet , jack soloff , tells the partners ,
&quot; if we let you back , the bleeding stops . &quot;
which is why i &apos;m here .
to thank you .
it would be so much less delightful
if you had just said yes right away .
well the least you could do is tell me your first target .
i &apos;ll give you a hint .
it &apos;s one that &apos;s gonna hit you right where it hurts .
i can &apos;t believe that in a couple of months
we &apos;ll be back here for your wedding .
i know , it &apos;s amazing . i can &apos;t believe
how much we have left to do .
mmm , speaking of which .
what &apos;s this ?
your wedding announcement for &quot; the times . &quot;
i know that you &apos;re busy , so i took the liberty
of writing it up .
wedding announcement ?
yes .
um , mom , i don &apos;t think that--
i left a couple of things blank .
i wasn &apos;t sure where mike went for undergrad .
was it cornell or columbia ?
oh , and was he on the harvard law review ?
and they &apos;re gonna want a picture of the two of you .
i was thinking maybe the central park boathouse ?
we &apos;re not doing an announcement .
what ?
mike and i , we &apos;re not interested in this .
i don &apos;t understand .
when you read your cousin nicole &apos;s announcement ,
you didn &apos;t have a problem with it .
&apos;cause something like this is right for nicole .
it &apos;s not right for me .
you mean it &apos;s not right for mike ?
oh , come on , mom . what are you talking about ?
two years ago , you wouldn &apos;t have had a problem
with something like this .
well , it &apos;s not two years ago ,
and this is how we both feel .
so i &apos;m just asking you to respect my wishes
because we have so much more to go over , okay ?
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s cutie pie cosmetics .
joan &apos;s ready to retire .
no one gives a shit about joan walsh &apos;s business .
it &apos;s nader communications .
why , because they &apos;re you &apos;re client ?
no , because they were jack &apos;s client
and now they &apos;re my client .
so this is all about you ?
louis , calm down .
no , this is all about you .
you know what ? you &apos;re the one who gave hardman the opening he needed .
did you hear what i just said ?
excuse me ?
yeah , you heard me . this wouldn &apos;t be happening
if you didn &apos;t try to suspend me .
after you punched me in the face .
if you really want to know who &apos;s at fault here ,
why don &apos;t you take a look in the mirror ?
that &apos;s enough .
this is exactly what hardman wants .
he &apos;s trying to get us to turn on each other .
well , the fight is out there , not in here ,
and we have to figure out who hardman &apos;s target is .
where the hell are you going ?
you &apos;re right , the fight is out there ,
but jack soloff &apos;s in here .
you think it &apos;s a good idea to let him go after jack ?
what &apos;s he gonna do ? make him less on our side ?
you &apos;re right .
there &apos;s more important things to do here anyway .
yeah , and number one on the list
is if you think that hardman &apos;s really going after nader communications ,
then we need to get over there and warn them .
it &apos;s not nader , it &apos;s mckernon motors .
it can &apos;t be mckernon . they &apos;re too small .
not since we did that battery deal .
and i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
&quot; avery mckernon &apos;s estate still owns
too much of the stock , &quot;
but not anymore .
who bought it ?
it doesn &apos;t matter who bought it .
it matters who the attorney of record is .
let me guess , daniel hardman .
exactly .
goddamn it .
harvey , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to see dominic barone .
well , then i &apos;m going with you .
no , you &apos;re not .
they &apos;re my oldest client ,
and this is something i have to do .
harvey , this is a client that you gave to me and louis .
yeah , and you were smart enough
to figure out they were the target .
now i need you to use that brain
to start figuring out how we &apos;re gonna get out of this .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna look dominic barone in the eye
and tell him i &apos;m the reason this is happening .
jack , i need to talk to you .
you can save your breath , louis .
i know what you &apos;re here to say .
you &apos;re here to tell me not to go against
your precious harvey and jessica .
no , i &apos;m here to tell you that you have no idea
who you &apos;re in bed with .
well , i appreciate your concern for my well @-@ being ,
but i can handle myself .
no you can &apos;t .
what difference does it make , louis ?
it &apos;s too late .
it &apos;s not too late .
you think if i suddenly abandon daniel ,
jessica &apos;s just gonna welcome me back with open arms ?
yes , you don &apos;t know how forgiving she can be .
i trust her . the only thing she &apos;s going
to forgive me with is a knife in the back .
jack , listen to me .
daniel hardman treated me like a son .
he promoted me to senior partner ,
used me to take over the firm .
after he lost power , he turns around
and slaps me with a sexual harassment claim .
i know . monica eaton .
but what you don &apos;t know is that it was bullshit .
he betrayed me .
humiliated me .
and after i finally confronted him about it ,
he tells me ...
that i got what i always wanted .
so , jack , believe me , if you think this man
cares about you , he doesn &apos;t .
i know what kind of man he is , louis .
then why are you siding with him ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
he promised to do something jessica never would .
put my name on the wall .
what if she would ?
you &apos;re not in reality .
jack , she did it for me .
even if i wanted to go with you , i couldn &apos;t .
he &apos;s got something on you , doesn &apos;t he ?
this conversation is over .
harvey , what the hell ?
i just got notification of a tender offer .
they &apos;re coming after my company .
i know , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
so they sent the big guns to fight
because it &apos;s a hostile takeover ?
i &apos;m not here because it &apos;s a hostile takeover .
i &apos;m here because this whole thing is my fault .
what do you mean your fault ?
the reason you &apos;re in the crosshairs is because
daniel hardman has a vendetta against me .
you &apos;re telling me we just closed a deal
that ensures this company &apos;s future
and you put it in jeopardy because you pissed off
your former partner ?
yes , that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
god damn it .
well what do you want me to do , dominic ?
i want you to stop being an asshole to people .
it &apos;s too late for that .
but it may not be too late for this .
drop us as your attorneys .
what ?
as long as you &apos;re connected to us ,
there &apos;s gonna be a target on your back .
you let us go , there &apos;s a chance it goes away .
harvey .
if i was just gonna cut you loose because someone hates you ,
i wouldn &apos;t have hired you in the fist place ,
because we both know
i used to hate you .
thanks , dominic .
so what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
but i &apos;ll tell you this :
they want a war , they got a war .
hey , rach , do you have that neilson brief for louis from last month ?
no , i don &apos;t .
are you sure ? because he keeps telling me that you have it .
and i keep telling him i don &apos;t
and i have more important things to do
than sit around and answer the same question every other day .
and i have better things to do with my time
than to be spoken to that way .
i &apos;m sorry .
rachel , what &apos;s going on ?
i just had lunch with my mom
to talk about our wedding , and she wants to put
an announcement in &quot; the new york times . &quot;
oh , my god .
did you tell her that she can &apos;t do that ?
yeah . i made up some story about it being snobby ,
but donna , that &apos;s just the tip of the iceberg .
what are you talking about ?
this is her proposed guest list .
it is 300 people and it includes
the attorney general and the dean of harvard law .
what am i gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna tell her that you don &apos;t want
a big wedding and that &apos;s that .
and if i do that , she &apos;s gonna know that something &apos;s not right .
rachel , this is the type of argument
that every mother has with every daughter
about her wedding .
she &apos;s never gonna think that mike &apos;s a fraud .
how &apos;d dominic take it ?
he took it fine .
good , &apos; cause i have a plan .
let &apos;s hear it .
we go to the last place they &apos;d ever expect
and we offer to merge .
where ?
fletcher engines .
are you crazy ?
we go to fletcher , they &apos;re gonna kick dominic out ,
jack gains power .
might as well have let mckernon get bought out in the first place .
then the only other option that &apos;s even remotely possible
is we take them private .
that actually might work .
come to think of it , why the hell didn &apos;t you
just say that to me in the first place ?
because i knew you &apos;d shit on whatever my first idea was
and that you &apos;d be open to the backup .
you &apos;re telling me you set up a straw man idea
to manipulate me into liking your real idea ?
yep .
how long you been doing that ?
peabody versus danthorpe .
son of a bitch .
all right , smart guy .
now where are we gonna get the money for the equity ?
i &apos;ll tell you where . sidwell and gianopolous .
is that another straw man idea ?
because you &apos;ll never get the two of them
to go in on a deal together . they hate each other .
oh , those two hating each other is exactly
what i &apos;m counting on .
hey , mom .
oh , rachel !
you &apos;re just in time .
the caterer dropped off some samples .
i was just about to try them , but it &apos;ll be much more fun
if we do this together .
okay , mom , but before you pour that .
i don &apos;t think that the crostini travels very well .
mom , please .
i know that you have given this a lot of thought ,
but i need to talk to you about the size of the wedding .
it &apos;s way too big .
i have given this a lot of thought ,
and 30 people at a wedding
isn &apos;t going to get a chef like this .
right , but i &apos;m not having a wedding based on the chef ,
and i &apos;m not here to talk about the menu .
i &apos;m here to talk about the guest list .
rachel , did i ever tell you what your father did
three weeks before we got married ?
bought two tickets to bermuda and said we &apos;re eloping .
and he did that because he didn &apos;t want
to deal with my mother .
but you know what stopped me ?
i knew that i would regret doing that to my mom
for the rest of my life .
but i told you this isn &apos;t about mike ,
and it isn &apos;t about eloping .
this is just about me not wanting to get married
in front of hundreds of people that i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s going on here , rachel ?
i &apos;m telling you what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;re just not hearing me .
i don &apos;t want this big of a wedding .
i &apos;m hearing you , but i know my own daughter ,
and there is something that you &apos;re not telling me .
okay , mom .
yes , there is something that i &apos;m not telling you ,
and that &apos;s because it &apos;s really hard for me to say it .
you keep thinking that this is about mike .
well , it &apos;s not .
this is about you not accepting that it &apos;s
my wedding and it &apos;s not yours .
rachel .
and if you can &apos;t figure out a way to accept that ,
then i think maybe we will have to elope .
jessica , can i talk to you for a second ?
can it wait till tomorrow ?
no .
i think we should consider promoting
jack soloff to name partner .
are you crazy ?
jessica , we are under attack .
and you &apos;re asking me to reward our enemy .
no , i &apos;m asking you to bring our enemy &apos;s right hand
over to our side .
louis , it &apos;s late . i &apos;m going home .
jessica , you have to listen to me , please .
hardman &apos;s got something on him .
has what on him ?
i don &apos;t know , but until two months ago ,
the only thing we knew about jack soloff
is that he bills more hours than anyone but me .
so , what , you think he just woke up one day
and became mastermind of a palace coup ?
the question isn &apos;t who &apos;s in charge between those two ,
it &apos;s whether jack is a volunteer
or a conscription .
i &apos;m telling you , i talked to him .
he &apos;s doing all this staring down the barrel of a gun .
then putting jack &apos;s name on the door
only gives daniel more power .
what are you saying ?
if hardman has something on him ,
then we need to have it on him too .
so instead of telling me that we should promote him ,
why don &apos;t you get to work on that ?
i thought i made it clear last time we talked
i &apos;m not interested in whatever you &apos;re selling .
well , you &apos;re gonna be interested in this .
there is no deal you &apos;re gonna put in front of my face
that &apos;s gonna make me want to get in business with you .
you &apos;re not doing it to get in business with me .
you &apos;re doing it to keep me
from getting into business with tony gianopolous .
&apos;cause , right now , harvey is over there
pitching him the same deal .
and you think i give a shit what deals harvey specter does ?
i think you give a shit what deals jonathan sidwell does .
and you &apos;re here to pit us against each other
just to jack up the price .
damn right i am .
then you can walk your ass out that door right now .
because i guarantee you
that &apos;s what sidwell &apos;s telling harvey .
and what harvey &apos;s telling him is that one of you
is gonna be on cnbc tomorrow announcing their new deal ...
and the other one &apos;s going to be left with nothing
but his dick in his hand ,
so , it &apos;s up to you .
but whoever calls first is gonna have it
over the other one for the rest of their life .
clock &apos;s ticking , tony .
i get a text , he beats you to the punch .
i walk out that door .
so , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
you &apos;re a son of a bitch .
i like that .
i &apos;m in .
i &apos;m in .
no , no , listen . i don &apos;t care when they need it .
i get 15 minutes a day to eat my breakfast
and i didn &apos;t get it this morning .
okay ? i just reheated my egg mcmuffin
and i &apos;m going to eat it in peace .
hello , beautiful .
finally , it &apos;s just you and me .
barnaby , right ?
actually , it &apos;s benjamin , and i &apos;m kind of on--
oh , i don &apos;t care what you &apos;re on .
i need everything you have on jack soloff .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
it means that i need a detailed account
of all the cases he &apos;s worked on since he started here .
well , that &apos;s really more of a file room issue , so--
hey , benson , if i wanted to go to the file room ,
i &apos;d go to god damn file room ,
but i don &apos;t because i also want all billing records ,
phone records , personal e @-@ mails--
whoa , personal e @-@ mails ?
yes . if he scheduled a prostate exam ,
i want to know about it .
isn &apos;t that just part of the annual checkup ?
what are you , c. everett coop ? just get it done .
and the next time i ask you to do something ,
do it without asking any stupid questions ,
you got it ?
you know , mike ross always brings me food .
what ?
i &apos;m just saying , whenever michael needs a favor ,
he brings me something .
you know , like , a warm bag of bacon
or french fries .
this isn &apos;t a favor . this is your god damn job .
so get me what i ask for pronto
or the next time i &apos;ll stop by and bring you a warm bag of shit .
and now i don &apos;t even want my egg mcmuffin .
hey , donna , do you have a second ?
of course .
rachel , what &apos;s wrong ?
i talked to my mom last night .
and i take it it didn &apos;t go well .
no , it went horribly , and i threatened to elope .
rachel , it &apos;s okay .
look , we talked about this .
if she &apos;s thinking that you &apos;re being difficult ,
then she &apos;s not thinking something else is going on .
no , no , but she could tell that i &apos;m hiding something
and i had to sit there and lie to her and ...
and tell her that it was her fault .
rachel , she &apos;s not going to know about mike .
you don &apos;t get it .
i &apos;m thinking about telling my mom the truth .
rachel , that is a bad idea .
your mom can get over some spat
about the size of your wedding ,
but she &apos;s not going to get over this .
all i know is , my mom loves me no matter what .
i understand that , but rachel ,
if you do this ,
you &apos;re going to be burdening your mother
with a secret that she has to keep
from your father for the rest of her life .
how did you two get in here ?
you showed us you can get to us .
now you know we can get to you .
then you must be here to hand me the keys
to mckernon motors .
actually , we &apos;re here to inform you
that mckernon motors is going private .
that &apos;s all well and good , but there &apos;s the matter
of my tender offer , which is up to the shareholders
and my 20 % is voting to take it .
good for you .
we &apos;re pretty sure the other 80 %
is gonna want to take our offer , seeing as it is
ten dollars per share higher than yours .
bullshit .
where &apos;d you get that kind of money ?
we got it at the united bank of take your ass back to jersey .
so , you can keep coming after us all you want , daniel ,
but they &apos;re all going to end up just like this .
then i &apos;m going to raise my offer .
ten dollars a share , because if you two think
you can beat me , you can &apos;t .
told you .
told him what ?
that was your ceiling .
he thought it was 15 a share more .
i thought you had bigger balls .
either way , we just wanted to find out
what it was so we could come over the top
and crush you .
because our real offer is 20 more per share
and we don &apos;t care who your investor is ,
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re paying more than that
just to fund your grudge .
see you around , daniel .
by the way , mike pissed in your bonsai .
yeah , that &apos;s right . two times .
by the way , nice usual suspects reference
back there .
really , you caught that ?
yeah , i caught it . what do you think i am ?
nothing , i just didn &apos;t think you &apos;d get it .
it was so subtle .
trust me , not so subtle .
well , if it was so ham @-@ fisted , why didn &apos;t you just
chime in back there ?
because i was there to stick it to hardman ,
not clown around with some quote @-@ fest .
that &apos;s the difference between you and me .
i can do both at the same time .
really ? see , at your age ,
i &apos;m surprised that you can even make it through a meeting
that long without having to pee .
okay , why do you always have to go straight to the prostate ?
it &apos;s so distasteful .
oh , right . and you telling hardman
that i &apos;d peed in his bonsai was just pure class .
i didn &apos;t say you peed in his bonsai .
i said you pissed in it . what are you , five ?
and by the way , you &apos;re the one who told him
you did it twice .
because you started it .
i had to lean in . it &apos;s called committing .
then how about you commit to buying the next round
for a change ?
i &apos;d love to , but i can &apos;t .
i got to go meet rachel at her mom &apos;s .
talk about some wedding stuff .
i &apos;d love to join you ,
but i &apos;d rather have a prostate exam .
there you go .
see ? you &apos;re leaning in .
i &apos;m proud of you .
excuse me , ma &apos;am , could you make sure
to cut him off when he starts mumbling about
how they don &apos;t make shows like
welcome back cotter anymore ?
what are you doing here , daniel ?
just wondering what color to paint the walls .
i &apos;ve never been partial to red .
instead of commenting on my wall color ,
why don &apos;t you go back to your office ?
lick your wounds .
what wounds ? i &apos;m about to win .
you have a funny definition of win .
since we just blew your best offer out of the water .
here &apos;s a copy of my new offer .
it &apos;ll be in &quot; the journal &quot; tomorrow .
there &apos;s no way the deal holds up under this price .
and once your client figures that out ,
your offer falls through .
well , then lucky for me , my client &apos;s japanese
and the dollar just took a dive against the yen .
so my deal will hold up and then some .
you know , i don &apos;t give a shit where your client &apos;s from .
i don &apos;t lose to you .
yes you do .
because after this deal , there &apos;ll be another one
and another one and another one ,
because you took my firm from me and i &apos;m going to take it
right back from you .
get the hell out of my office , daniel ,
before i do something you &apos;ll regret .
speaking of walls ,
how does it feel to have them closing in on you ?
son of a bitch !
louis , is something wrong ?
see this ?
it contains everything on god &apos;s green earth
there is to know about jack edward soloff
from his pirate beard to his stupid pen
that he carries around like linus &apos;s blanket .
and ... ?
and there &apos;s no dirt on him !
there &apos;s not one case he crossed a line on .
there &apos;s no debts . nothing .
louis .
did you hear me ? is soloff did something
and hardman &apos;s a part of it , it is buried so deep ,
we &apos;ll never even see the top of it ,
let alone get to the bottom of it .
louis , i &apos;m about to tell you something i never
thought i would .
what ?
the night that harvey and mike put it together
about daniel and cm ,
they got stoned first .
what ?
they thought you and daniel had them and they were screwed
and they figured , &quot; what the hell ? &quot;
so they bought some marijuana and they got high .
are you suggesting we take the pot ?
worked for them .
well , it &apos;s not gonna work for me .
louis--
donna , look at me .
do i look like someone who needs to be hungry
and paranoid ?
relax .
it was just a suggestion .
well it was a stupid god damn suggestion ,
and if that &apos;s all you have , just walk you ass out of here .
louis , what is going on ? why are you so angry at me ?
i &apos;m not angry at you .
i &apos;m angry at myself .
louis .
after the vote , harvey told me it was my fault
and you want to know what ? he &apos;s right .
harvey says a lot of things .
you told me too .
what ?
this whole thing started because i told jack
that he could bring up harvey &apos;s compensation
for a vote , and you told me not to .
well , then maybe it &apos;s my fault too .
because this whole thing really started when you tried
to make things right with harvey for
me coming to work for you .
donna , are you saying that you regret coming to me ?
no , louis . i &apos;m saying maybe
i had a hand in this too .
what do we do now ?
we keep looking together .
and if we can &apos;t find anything , then we tell jessica the truth .
laura , hi , how are you ?
where &apos;s rachel , i thought for sure
she &apos;d beat me here .
uh , rachel &apos;s not coming .
i told her i wasn &apos;t feeling well
because i wanted to talk to you alone .
is something wrong ?
yes , there is .
rachel told me today that
she wants to scale back the wedding
and that you two are in sync on this .
sounds like you don &apos;t believe her .
found it hard enough to believe that she wouldn &apos;t
want to put an announcement in &quot; the times , &quot;
but that my little girl , who always dreamed
of getting married at the plaza hotel
now only wants a handful of people there ?
i &apos;m sorry , michael .
i just don &apos;t buy it .
this is coming from you , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re right .
it is .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
i don &apos;t have a family .
i don &apos;t have a lot of people that i can invite ,
and i asked her if we could please
keep the entire wedding low @-@ key .
and she said that she would do that for me .
and i understand that .
i think it &apos;s incredibly sweet of her
to be willing to do that for you .
but ...
if you could find it in your heart
to let my little girl have the wedding
that she &apos;s always wanted , i am telling you ,
she &apos;ll remember it for the rest of her life .
again ?
you know , i &apos;d really prefer it if i gave you a key
so i wouldn &apos;t have to wonder how you keep getting in .
and i &apos;d really prefer it if you checked your cell phone
every once in a while so that i wouldn &apos;t
have to keep doing this .
i have a cell phone ?
you do
and if you &apos;d check it , you &apos;d know that daniel hardman
topped our bid by 20 % .
that &apos;s impossible .
no , it isn &apos;t .
because the dollar took a dive against the yen
and it turns out his client is japanese .
god damn it , we are not losing
to that son of a bitch .
why the hell did you think i &apos;m here ?
we need to go back to gianopolous and get more money .
jessica , he &apos;s not going to pay that much .
no one in his right mind would .
then go to somebody who &apos;s not in his right mind ,
because that lying bastard isn &apos;t going to stop
until his name is back up on the wall .
wait a second , the dollar took a dive
against the yen two weeks ago .
which means there &apos;s something else going on here .
oh , i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .
hardman &apos;s been playing with us this whole time .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i need to go see a guy about a thing .
where were you ?
i was with your mom .
what ?
didn &apos;t you get the message ? she had to postpone .
she didn &apos;t postpone , rachel . she blindsided me .
what are you talking about ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were fighting with her ?
because mothers and daughters fight about weddings
all the time .
but you weren &apos;t fighting about the wedding .
you were fighting about my secret .
and what does that have to do with anything ?
because she doesn &apos;t even know it .
because i &apos;m trying to protect you .
i understand that , but you have to share
these things with me .
why ?
&apos;cause instead of protecting me ,
you hung me out to dry .
and how exactly did i do that ?
by making it seem like i &apos;m the one
that &apos;s taking away your dream wedding .
you are the one taking away my dream wedding .
rachel .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s a lot ,
and she wanted to make this announcement
in &quot; the new york times &quot; and had this huge guest list
and the dean of harvard law and i just--
i don &apos;t want you to get caught .
you don &apos;t want me to get caught
or you don &apos;t want to marry me ?
what ?
i went to see claire .
i know she knows .
and i want to know if that made you
have second thoughts about us .
you went to see claire ? why ...
why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
because she told me that if i really loved you ,
i wouldn &apos;t marry you .
and i was afraid to tell you that
because i thought maybe you feel the same way .
well , it , um ,
it sounds like you &apos;re the one who &apos;s having second thoughts .
no .
no , i &apos;m not having second thoughts ,
but i do hate the idea that i am somehow dragging
you into something that is gonna ruin your life .
you are not dragging me into anything
and you &apos;re not ruining my life , mike .
i don &apos;t care about the plaza or who comes or--
i don &apos;t care about any of it .
the only thing that matters to me is that
the man that i &apos;m marrying is you .
and if you take that away from me ,
i don &apos;t--
rachel , rachel , listen , look at me , look at me .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
okay ? we &apos;re getting married .
and it could be as small as possible
with just our close friends , okay ?
okay ?
okay .
i need to talk to you .
what is it , louis ?
i couldn &apos;t find what hardman has on jack .
that doesn &apos;t sound like something you needed
to be waiting by the elevators to tell me .
i &apos;ve been thinking . what if we tell him
we &apos;ll only make him name partner if he takes a public stand
against daniel first ? that way , even if he tries
to go against it later , it won &apos;t work .
did you speak to him about this ?
i have .
and ?
he said he &apos;ll be on board .
and jessica ,
i believe him .
then tell him to come see me at the end of the day .
turns out i &apos;m getting married .
yeah , i know .
i was telling my future mother @-@ in @-@ law
about how i didn &apos;t have any friends or any family
when i realized ,
whatever happened between you and me ...
you &apos;re the closest thing to family that i have .
so what do you say we get together ?
you wanted to see me ?
i did .
i , uh ... i just want to say ,
based on what louis said that you &apos;re prepared to do--
louis has no idea what i &apos;m prepared to do
because the only thing i &apos;m prepared to do
is give you a chance to come to jesus .
and you &apos;re looking at her .
come to jesus about what ?
stop tap dancing , jack .
what the hell does daniel hardman have on you ?
you can ask me that question a million times .
i &apos;m never even going to acknowledge its premise .
and you just did .
and if it &apos;s that bad , and daniel knows it
and i don &apos;t ,
then i only have one choice .
so , what i &apos;m prepared to do now is this .
resign tonight and i &apos;ll waive your non @-@ compete .
what ?
oh , you didn &apos;t actually think
i was going to make you a name partner , did you ?
here &apos;s my counter .
you resign , and i waive your non @-@ compete .
you want me gone , call for a vote .
you want me gone , you do the same thing
because i &apos;m a partner as much as you
and you &apos;re the one on the ropes .
i &apos;m not on shit ,
because we know what &apos;s going on with daniel &apos;s investor
and harvey &apos;s about to put a stop to it right now .
if you really knew what was going on
between daniel and his investor ,
you &apos;d know it &apos;s never gonna happen .
then i guess we &apos;ll just have to see what we see .....
harvey specter . what a nice surprise .
wanna play a little pool ?
we go for 10,000 a game in here .
you &apos;re playing a lot more expensive game than that ,
funding daniel hardman to be your frontman .
and you &apos;re welcome to go ahead and prove that ,
but he &apos;s got full power of attorney
until i get out of here in two years .
yeah , i don &apos;t care how many years you have left .
it &apos;s about to feel like the rest of your life ,
because this is where you &apos;re gonna spend it .
bullshit .
only the bureau of prisons can approve a transfer .
i know , but the thing is , i went to see sean cahill today .
turns out he wants you to testify in a trial .
so , you can call the bureau of prisons
all you want .
by the time your lawyers get you out ,
you &apos;re never gonna be the same again .
i get it .
you want me to stop backing hardman .
and you go back to working on your break
and i don &apos;t have to see your face again .
you &apos;re living in a dream world , pal ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s never gonna happen .
well then here &apos;s my advice .
when you get to rikers , drink bleach .
it &apos;ll get you sent to the infirmary .
it &apos;s much safer there .
oh , i don &apos;t need to go to the infirmary
&apos;cause i got something that &apos;s gonna keep me
as safe as a baby in his mother &apos;s arms .
money .
you take that chance , charles ,
but if there &apos;s one guy
who doesn &apos;t give a shit about your money ,
he &apos;s gonna get you , and nobody &apos;s gonna stop him .
here &apos;s the thing , harvey .
nobody doesn &apos;t give a shit about money .
besides , in a week , i &apos;ll be right back here
picking off your clients one by one .
you want to stop me , step down .
what ?
you resign ,
his money goes away .
i knew it .
you care about the people there ,
just like you cared about your little brother way back when .
no way .
no deal .
now , before you give me an answer--
you came here tonight because you know
you &apos;re gonna lose anyway .
so why not save whatever poor sap it is
while you still can ?
why should i believe you would even live up
to your end of the bargain ?
because i don &apos;t give a shit about your war
with daniel hardman .
and i sure as hell don &apos;t give a shit
about your firm .
all i want to do is see you get down
on your knees and say , &quot; i quit . &quot;
trevor .
hey , mike .
thanks for coming .
yeah , hey ,
i &apos;m glad you called .
yeah , me too .
listen , uh , about the last time ,
i said some things--
ah , we both said some things .
but i did some things . and i &apos;m sorry .
well , uh , i have a way you can make it up to me .
come to my wedding .
it means a lot to me that you want me there ,
but i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ?
look , i &apos;m married now ,
and i promised my wife that that part of my life
is behind me .
what does that have to do with you coming to my wedding ?
she didn &apos;t even want me to meet you here .
don &apos;t you get it ?
you &apos;re breaking the law
every day .
you &apos;re judging me ?
no .
i &apos;m not judging you .
nothing would make me happier than to raise a glass
to your new life ,
but i can &apos;t .
and you shouldn &apos;t either .
oh , so now i shouldn &apos;t get married ?
no , i &apos;m saying you should quit .
oh , okay .
well , thank you for the advice , trevor .
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to do that .
michael , the longer you go ,
the less the money matters .
the food doesn &apos;t taste as good .
the car isn &apos;t fast enough .
the view isn &apos;t high enough .
and finally you realize
that you would trade it all in
for one night of going to bed
where you don &apos;t have to worry ,
&quot; when are they gonna come for me ? &quot;
you almost got caught , didn &apos;t you ?
no , i didn &apos;t . i just couldn &apos;t take it any more .
so finally i went to talk to someone .
who ?
you know who .
i gotta go .
take care , micheal .
