i hate this .
every year , every year it &apos;s like this .
finally squeeze into a train to union square ,
couldn &apos;t fall down if you &apos;re shot .
come on . it &apos;s impossible to catch a cab .
peter , peter ...
ah , thank you .
yes , enjoy your day .
it &apos;s fashion week , peter .
embrace it .
here we go . excellent .
good . alright . oh no .
yes , alright .
let me help you here .
squeeze .
we &apos;re suppose to be interviewing our witness right now .
peter , alright . relax .
that &apos;s not gonna do it .
we &apos;re after an israeli counterfeiter
goes by the name of ghovat .
we &apos;re going after &quot; the ghost &quot; ?
we &apos;re going after &quot; the ghost . &quot;
what do you know about him ?
this guy is nefarious . he counterfeit treasury bonds , dollars .
he &apos;s rumors to be
the first guy to crack the microprinting on the euro .
well , now we can add murder to that list .
are you sure he called himself ghovat ?
yes .
okay .
what happened ?
i was at the party .
why were you there ?
many modals were invited .
it happened as i was leaving .
when i went for my coat .
i was in the backroom when the two men came in .
they were arguing .
they didn &apos;t see you ?
i made sure to keep out of sight ,
in the closet ...
they started to shouting at each other .
then suddenly everything went
very quiet .
the man who called himself ghovat , i heard him leaving .
when i walk out that &apos;s when i saw the other man .
he was on the floor , already dead .
okay .
our men are gonna stay with you from now .
but if you need anything , day or night , you feel free to call me .
if you heard this man again , do you think you could identify him ?
i will never forget his voice as long as i live .
have you ided the dead guy ?
fraud national out of turkey . known as associate of ghovat .
fallen out of our business .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
by working theory , this has something to do with fashion week .
well , assuming our &quot; ghost &quot; has something to sell ,
fashion week is a great cover .
he &apos;s got his all these buyers in new york this week ,
with no bells going off .
unfortunately , we &apos;ve got 30,000 buyers .
we &apos;ve also got someone who can identify his voice .
are you gonna share ?
you &apos;re gonna think i &apos;m crazy .
that &apos;s never stoped you before .
we throw a party .
is this your birthday ?
no
you are crazy .
look , okay . look at this .
monte carlo , cannes , ibiza , rio ...
this guy likes to have a good time .
we put women , booze , fashion all together in once .
and what do we do ? send him an evite ?
he replies &quot; ghost &quot; plus one ?
no , we bring him to us .
we have tara there in the room listening .
she can id him .
don &apos;t dance in the office .
a party ?
the witness is confident she can identify him by his voice .
how do you know he &apos;ll show up ?
we fill up with beautiful women .
i was addressing my case , agent .
looking at his m.o. , he has a thing for modals .
yeah ? well , me too .
hey jones , do you like modals ?
love &apos; em .
jones likes &apos; em too . is there a plan in here somewhere ?
call me when one shows up .
look
caffrey , ghovat ,
these guys are cut from the same cloth .
neal &apos;s convinced that our &quot; ghost &quot; will show up .
i say we trust his instincts on this one .
we &apos;ve never been this close to ghovat .
i &apos;ll authorize five grand for this party .
you know , fifteen will be better .
we &apos;ll make five work .
yes , and we get elizabeth to help us .
my wife ?

yeah .
wow , drop the watch , convict . we &apos;re not on a shopping &apos;s break .
no , it wasn &apos;t for me , it &apos;s for you .
oh , thank you , but there &apos;s nothing wrong with my old watch .
honey , actually that looks great on you .
well , a little out of my price range .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with enjoying the good things in life , peter .
then why do they always seem to end up in here ?
okay , so we &apos;ve got the alcoho and the food covered ,
now we just need the venue .
don &apos;t worry , i got that covered .
it &apos;s a loft .
ceased in the dea bust .
1,500 square feet . service elevator
it &apos;s perfect .
is that a chalk outline ?
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ve cleaned that up by now .
it has everything you need .
year , if five drunk frat buddies show up .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be lining up super models ?
64 and counting .
oh , neal caffrey throws a party ,
and 64 super models show up .
sorry , my mistake , 65 , actually .
these two are twins .
is that another one of your super models ?
no , it &apos;s just a friend .
he &apos;s got a place we can use .
you think your friend &apos;s place is better than mine ?
okay , it &apos;s better than mine .
yeah , okay
it &apos;s a lot better than mine .
honey , i am really impressive of this place .
i mean i can have a state dinner up here . how did you pull it off ?
he has a source .
but good luck trying to pry it out of him .
sounds like fun , i &apos;ll work on him later .
she &apos;ll work on you later .
hey guys , i got twenty minutes to get fiber optics in play .
i want a camera in every single entrance and exit ,
starting with that one right there .
let &apos;s go .
hello .
you &apos;re definitely in the right place .
you &apos;re also a little early
and you must be neal caffrey .
i am .
would you mind waiting inside for a little bit ?
actually , i think i &apos;am exactly where i &apos;m supposed to be .
then let me escort you downstairs at leaset .
no , i gotta say ,
i expected a little more .
i mean , you are charming enough , but ...
who invited you again ?
the agency .
i thought you were a model .
and i thought you were supposed to be one of the smart ones .
neal , this is agent lauren cruz
i just had her transfered here over .
she is gonna be keeping an eye on you tonight .
so where do you keep your gun ?
damn , caffrey knows how to throw a party .
hey , agent burke .
what ?
is that miss march ?
jones , pull it all together .
sports illustrated , not play boy .
doing okay ?
come on , i &apos;m with the most beautiful girl here ,
i want to see her smile .
neal . straight ahead , red shirt , dark jacket ,
seems pretty jumpy for a guy to be at a party filled with models .
so , let &apos;s mingle .
excuse me .
hi , i saw you looking around , can i help you find someone ?
i know almost everybody here .
except for you ... mr ...
dmitri
dimitri
write down that name -- &quot; dmitri . &quot;
i &apos;m just ... admiring the view .
year , beautiful crowd , right ?
quite stunning .
excuse me .
yes .
no dice , peter . not our voice .
all right
wait . he &apos;s speaking hebrew .
what &apos;s he saying ?
he &apos;s saying &quot; i &apos;m waiting where are you &quot;
ghovat is here . he &apos;s watching him . ghovat &apos;s here .
peter , he &apos;s here , he &apos;s watching dmitri right now .
i got it .
back me up , i need you to flirt .
what ?
you &apos;re charming enough , right ?
that guy right there .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
you just look very familiar .
sorry .
do i know you from somewhere ?
we need to leave .
go .
how are you ? have you met ... ?
no .
hello .
you know , my friend here , isabella ,
was noticing how fantastic your suit is .
we have to leave , unfortunately , but it was lovely to see you .
have a good night .
i &apos;m a model .
where do you work ?
actually , you know what , i think you &apos;re right .
i think i don &apos;t know you . i &apos;m sorry .
there he is .
i got it , i got it .
move in , repeat , move in , now now now !
get off me !
this is madness !
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not him .
peter , we got the wrong guy !
you &apos;re not getting this thing off me ?
i &apos;m working on it .
you &apos;re lucky .
they have you on the 2 @-@ mile tether .
that &apos;s a lot in new york .
remember jimmy dimako ?
the feds had his anklet set at 22 feet .
he had to take a shower with one foot out of the tub .
it &apos;s not true .
ok , may be 30 feet .
but you have it better .
2 @-@ miles isn &apos;t enough , moz .
i need to find kate .
man with the ring was with kate in california .
you tell me what he wants from her ?
cause he didn &apos;t find what he was looking for in santiago .
how do you know what he was looking for ?
because i told kate i kept everything ,
the money , the bonds , the arts , all of it in santiago .
well , clearly that &apos;s not the truth ,
because you told me
it was all hidden in portland , isn &apos;t it ?
isn &apos;t it ?
there is nothing hidden in either place , is there ?
it &apos;s a test .
you told her santiago , you told me portland .
then whichever rock gets over turned , you know who betrayed you .
look , i just needed to know what i already knew .
what ? that you can trust me ?
moz ...
that i &apos;m the one
who &apos;s been there through all of it ?
but kate-- kate is the one who kicked over your rock
kate didn &apos;t betray me , he forced her to .
then why didn &apos;t kate try to warn you
when she came to say goodbye to you that day in prision ?
i think she might have ,
but i was too stupid to see it .
here .
&quot; weep for me , my love . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll miss you more &quot; what is this
it &apos;s just an old love letter ,
it doesn &apos;t mean anything , okay ? but ...
the fbi was closing into us .
we started taking precautions .
we started passing codes .
that could be cracked by anyone
who &apos;s ever seen the back of mad magazine .
okay , you ask me why i don &apos;t tell you certain things
it &apos;s that attitude right there .
i &apos;m trying to be supportive
look , this was an early attempt .
okay , we got more sophisticated as the feds closed in
so you think when kate came to say goodbye
to you at prision , she left you a code ?
look , i need to see the security tape .
your friend at the fbi has access .
he &apos;s seen it
oh , yeah , he &apos;s not just gonna hand it over .
you could ... ask .
so , our ghost finally has a name .
it &apos;s idil hazeva .
let &apos;s stick with &quot; ghovat &quot; for now .
do we know anything more about him ?
not much , no criminal record .
name &apos;s not coming up on any of our
international watch lists .
we can &apos;t find him register anywhere in town .
anything about the girl ?
she is a model . we &apos;re looking at her .
what about dimitri ?
andrei dmitri ,
uzbekistan national , linked to a handful of enterprises ,
uh , arms trading money laundering , prescription @-@ drug fraud .
exactly the kind of guy you &apos;d expect to show up at fashion week .
yeah
does he still think he got away clean ?
un , yeah . he slipped out the northwest exit .
jones is sitting on him .
tell jones to keep his distance . i don &apos;t want him getting tagged .
let &apos;s see where this guy leads us .
good work
thanks .
we &apos;ll reconvenein an hour .
nice report .
thanks
you know , you pull off the whole fbi thing , too .
yeah , no one looks good in fbi slacks .
oh , don &apos;t sell yourself short .
better .
you sure i wasn &apos;t a little too direct and ...
yeah , but i like where you &apos;re going with it .
where we headed for lunch ?
oh , uh , i &apos;m gonna have to take a pass .
elizabeth wants to meet me in the park .
picnic . that &apos;s romantic .
yeah , should i be worried ?
did you do something wrong ?
probably .
show no fear .
maybe she &apos;s just gotten used to spending time with you .
you think ?
i &apos;m not the better person to ask .
hey peter , before you go ...
i need a favour
yeah ?
the last time kate visited mein prison ,
before she disappeared ,
you saw that security tape ?
yeah .
i &apos;d like to see it .
you think that &apos;s a good idea ?
it &apos;s the last time i saw her .
i just want some closure
help me wrap up this case ,
see what can i do about this tape .
this is nice .
right ?
this is really nice .
yeah , it &apos;great .
honey , relax . you are not in trouble .
oh , thank god
why do you think i asked you to have lunch ?
i don &apos;t know . that was what scared me .
okay , hold on .
i got you something .
you did ?
wow , it &apos;s a nice box
i noticed you were kind of looking at
the really nice watch at the warehouse .
it &apos;s not as nice , but it &apos;s close .
it &apos;s perfect .
okay , try it on .
that &apos;s a different kind of ...
yeah , just ...
different kind of latch , there .
yeah , you go ... there .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s ....
this is burke .
all right , i will be there at , uh ...
i &apos;ll be there in five minutes .
all right .
look at that , it works .
it works .
look good on you .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re moving me now .
what , protective custody ?
no one &apos;s threatening you .
they &apos;re not taking any chances .
came here to get an agent , make contacts , not this .
yeah . it &apos;s gonna be okay . all right ?
if anybody can catch ghovat ,
it &apos;s him .
really ?
he is the best .
come here . i just got word from jones .
woo . new watch .
mm , yeah , gift from elizabeth . thank you very much .
no sundial to clutter it up . very nice .
what &apos;s jones got ?
dmitri is at a fashion show .
lucky him .
and guess who &apos;s with him .
who ?
remember that model that was with ghovat last night ?
however you got us in here ,
i don &apos;t want to know .
that &apos;s our dmitry .
guy always looks like he &apos;s waiting for something to happen .
maybe he &apos;s waiting for ghovat .
he lost his phone last night .
if that was his onlyconnection to him ...
figuring the only way back in is through the girl .
i &apos;ll buy that .
want to go check it out ?
no , i can &apos;t . i start flashing my bedge , they &apos;ll scatter like rats .
you trust me ?
nope .
do you trust me talk to dmitry ?
what are you thinking ?
stand there and look menacing .
what ?
stand there and look menacing .
no , peter -- &quot; menacing &quot; -- you look like your kid just struck out .
what ? this is menacing .
no , it &apos;s not .
what are you talking ? it is menacing .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s menacing !
that &apos;s not it .
okay , that &apos;s it , right there . now cross your arms .
what are you doing ?
i wanna let him know you &apos;re packing .
yeah .
now say , &quot; i &apos;ll be back . &quot;
no .
dmitry , right ?
i never got your name .
no , you didn &apos;t .
what are you doing here ?
same thing as you are .
just waiting for a chance to talk to our beautiful friend .
you enjoyed the party ?
a little too much excitement for my taste .
well , you know what they say ?
&quot; it &apos;s not a party till the police break it up . &quot;
yeah , your little event may have attracted the wrong element .
as a matter of fact , my phone was stolen .
that can make it tough to contact people .
but there are always ways to get in touch with someone .
all right , let &apos;s cut the act .
we both know why we &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t know who you are , but you are way out of your league .
this game takes way more than money .
you &apos;re not the only buyer interested in what ghovat is selling .
i &apos;m the only one that matters .
you and your friend should take a walk .
he &apos;s definitely here to buy .
that girl could lead to wherever ghovat is staying .
i &apos;ll have jones keep tailing them .
hey , man , for the record , you &apos;re much scarier than other guy .
much .
looks like your boy dmitry is setting into a hotel on madison .
think he &apos;s staying there ?
well , he ain &apos;t bringing any luggage with him .
lock it down . put somebody on every exit . i &apos;m on my way .
gotcha .
anything ?
no .
he &apos;s been in there for .. two hours .
anybody in or out ?
no , and i got two agents on every exit .
this is burke .
got a report of two men arguing on the 50th floor .
dmitry is on the 50th floor .
jones , get that room .
damn it .
sex games gone wrong ?
no . could just be a message .
maybe he was trying to shut him up .
yeah , but we don &apos;t even know ghovat was here .
no , our &quot; ghost &quot; was here .
look , the knife wound matches the blade width and angle of
penetration on our foreign national killed by ghovat .
it &apos;s him .
do we know how ghovat got out of the building ?
yeah . found a service elevator down the hall .
wasn &apos;t on the reconstruction blueprints .
which is exactly why he picked this place .
yeah , this guy is good .
why a dress ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not off @-@ the @-@ rack .
there &apos;s no tag , which means it &apos;s couture .
we deal with a lot of knock offs .
ask me what i know about a prada bag sometime .
oh , look at this .
there &apos;s a slit here .
it &apos;s about the size of a electronic security strip .
a lot of the designers are building them into the clothes .
so , basically , it &apos;s a miniature flash drive ?
yeah , in theory , you could piggy back up to 4 gigs on one .
well , that &apos;s enough space
to smuggle all kinds of information worth killing for .
lauren , uh ...
gimme a photobook of all the designers who have showed this year .
let &apos;s find out who made this dress .
i don &apos;t know who this ghovat is .
you don &apos;t know his name ? hmm ?
not even by a rumor ?
my world is fashion .
we both know that we &apos;re not talking about fashion .
i have a show this evening . i must be prepared for it .
that &apos;s on hold .
you have no reason for any of this .
actually , i do .
can you explain
why one of your designs showed up at my murder scene ?
you are the police . you tell me .
whatever you did resulted in the death of two people .
and if i didn &apos;t do it ,
my son will be dead also .
all right , what happened ?
a few hours before my team and i are to leave tel aviv ,
my wife calls , tells me that they have my son .
ghovat kidnapped your child ?
and then i was told to clear my shop
and wait for instructions .
and then he showed up ,
told me i have to smuggle something into the states for him .
what was that something ?
all that i know is that it was in the dress .
that &apos;s it .
after we cleared u.s.customs ,
i heard from my wife that my son is returned to us .
alright look , two people were dead
because whatever you helped bring in the country .
is there anything you can tell me about it ?
well ,
i can show you the real dress .
that &apos;s it .
i always make two dresses .
i didn &apos;t tell him he took the wrong one
that makes sense .
dmitri shows up to get the dress from ghovat
and finds out it &apos;s a fake .
he struggled , ghovat manages to make it out alive .
so why kill him and bring all that heat ?
he &apos;s trying to salvage the deal
but can &apos;t if dmitri is running around
telling everybody the technology is no good .
what do you think is on this thing ?
could be launch codes , covert i.d.
formula for new coke , who knows ?
but our technology guys
will have an answer for us by tomorrow morning .
i don &apos;t know .
something that valuable
there &apos;s no way ghovat &apos;s gonna pack it up and go home .
i &apos;ve got a thought .
let &apos;s take our thread and go fishing .
how could you be so stupid ?
ghovat , please , you have to believe me .
i didn &apos;t know what you wanted me to do .
you , you didn &apos;t want me to know .
where &apos;s the dress now ?
it &apos;s gone . i sold it .
you sold the dress ?
my dress ?
someone made an offer ahead of the show .
he bought it for his fiancee .
how much did he pay ?
fifty thousand dollars
who did you sell it to ?
how long will we have to keep this up ?
just long enough to get noticed .
you &apos;re doing great tara .
i &apos;ll be doing better once this is over .
that dress really does look fantastic on you .
if only i could wear it on a runway .
there &apos;s nothing to say you won &apos;t someday .
can i get you a drink ?
new watch ?
yeah .
excuse me , sir ? this just arrived for you .
hello ?
i recognize you from the party .
who is this ?
i saw you steal dmitri &apos;s phone .
yeah , i was trying to eliminate the competition .
guess it worked .
so you know what you have ?
i know exactly what i got .
you paid fifty thousand for the dress .
i &apos;ll give you five million .
aw , my fiancee loves it so much , how about we make it ten ?
do you know who you &apos;re talking to ?
this is steve , right ?
i tried to be nice .
i tried to give you a choice .
nothing on the phone .
it &apos;s a burner .
you can pick up one of these at any corner deli .
prints ?
it &apos;s clean .
agent burke
what &apos;s up ?
we had two plain clothes taking tara home .
somebody got to them about a half @-@ hour ago .
got to them how ?
blasted the car to hell .
fortunately , our guys were wearing vests .
what about tara ?
they grabbed her , got away clean .
i have your girl .
what &apos;s the dress worth to you now ?
so , now what ?
you want the girl , i want the dress .
trade ?
where and when ?
i &apos;m not interested in meeting with you .
then who ?
agent peter burke .
why him ?
because it &apos;s really the fbi that holds the dress .
is he there now ?
it &apos;s for you .
this is burke .
sure you heard everything earlier .
you want me to make the exchange .
that &apos;s right .
i won &apos;t waste my time telling you to come alone .
just make sure to bring the real dress .
if it &apos;s not , are you gonna make me eat it ?
that &apos;s funny .
keep this phone on you .
you &apos;ll meet me at the central park bench
tomorrow afternoon at 4 : 00 p.m.
plenty of time for you to get your men into position .
you have to let me go to the exchange .
it &apos;s my fault tara is in trouble .
i &apos;m the one who paraded her around town in that dress .
the best thing you can do is
help me figure out what ghovat &apos;s game plan is .
he knows we &apos;re gonna have the place staked out .
he knows you &apos;re running a playbook .
right , so i &apos;m gonna toss the old one , come up with a new one .
no . no , you don &apos;t . that &apos;s the point .
see , he &apos;s counting on the fbi to have a plan .
so i do nothing ?
go with him .
like you would ?
if he expects you to have a plan ,
don &apos;t have one .
oh , that &apos;s the worst idea ever .
prepare all you can . just know it &apos;s all gonna change .
what would you do ?
go home and have dinner with my wife .
you meet this guy in central park
and you give him the dress and he gives you the girl ?
that &apos;s about the size of it .
i &apos;m really glad you got into the white collar crime division
where nothing exciting happens .
it &apos;s ... pretty dull stuff .
yeah .
um , i got you another present .
honey , not another one .
i @-@ i &apos;m enjoying my first one . don &apos;t ...
it &apos;s my old watch .
but i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i love my new one .
come on , honey , it &apos;sit &apos;s big , it &apos;s clunky ,
it moves around your wrist , and
i mean , it &apos;s beautiful , but ... it &apos;s not you .
take this .
i need you to be agent peter burke tomorrow .
and this --this is you .
besides , um , when all this is over with ,
i need you home at 6 : 00 right on the dot .
thank you .
and ghovat wants the dress
because it &apos;s been tagged with a security device .
we cracked the thread this morning .
it &apos;s holding the holographic code of the latest european currency seal .
we &apos;re using a counterfeit code .
we &apos;re hoping he won &apos;t be able to tell the difference .
but if he does , this could go south fast .
we &apos;re putting this girl &apos;s life at risk .
we could put the entire monetary system of europe at risk .
guess who wins .
i &apos;ll be running point .
we &apos;ve have eyes in the air , plain clothes on the ground .
cruz , jones , you &apos;re with me .
burke , you know what you got to do .
caffrey , put your hand down .
put it down !
i &apos;m just wondering where i &apos;ll be .
on a coffee run . you &apos;re not even supposed to be here .
any questions ?
then let &apos;s get into position .
are we good to go ?
we are good .
okay , people , let &apos;s do this .
can i come in ?
get in here !
close the door .
you &apos;re right on time .
i like to be punctual .
well , that &apos;s one thing we have in common .
i don &apos;t see you .
of course you don &apos;t .
he &apos;s signaling us .
555 @-@ 3147 .
he &apos;s giving us ghovat &apos;s incoming phone number . get me a trace .
yep , i &apos;m on it .
good , peter .
how do i know you have the girl ?
i want to hear her voice .
agent burke ?
tara , are you okay ?
bethesda fountain . that &apos;s 300 yards .
you &apos;ve got one minute .
if i see any of your agents or unmarked vehicles move ,
the girl &apos;s dead .
your time starts ... now .
everyone stay where you are ! stay down !
everybody hold their positions .
we still got him on gps , right ?
yeah .
just stay down ! stay down ! stay there !
standing down .
go get the dress .
if you &apos;ll notice , agent burke ,
i &apos;ve added a little fashion accessory of my own
to our model friend here .
the belt is lined with plastique .
i dial a number here ... and she goes &quot; boom .
