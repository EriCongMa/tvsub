put the knife down now .
he &apos;s not in yet .

you &apos;ve been walking past hotch &apos;s office for an hour .
emily &apos;s picking him up .
hotch told me he was cleared to drive .
he is .
she wants to do it .
what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s only had a month off rossi .
technically 34 days .
and you think that &apos;s long enough ?
you don &apos;t ? tell him .
no thanks . i like my job .
you like him more .
what if he &apos;s got ptsd ?
he was evaluated .
come on rossi we wrote those questions .
hotch knows exactly how to answer them .
so what are you gonna do
pick apart everything he does ?
how long should he be gone ? a year ? 2 ?
every day that foyet is out there hotch loses
and you know that .
you know what that makes hotch ?
distracted .
motivated .
derek .
he &apos;s coming back because he has to .
he needs to know we &apos;ve got his back .
he knows that .
then we don &apos;t let him forget it .
thanks .
does it hurt ?
it really only hurts when i think about it
which is pretty much all the time .
no no no .
get away you .
these are for hotch .
i get shot in the leg and i don &apos;t get any cookies .
you know he &apos;s gonna hate the attention .
it &apos;s cookies not cake .
he &apos;s probably gonna pretend like nothing happened anyway .
well it doesn &apos;t mean we have to .
i think maybe we should .
i don &apos;t roll that way .
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ?
the entire time i &apos;ve known hotch
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen him blink .
i know .
it &apos;s weird .
classic alpha male behavior .
do you think he stared down foyet ?
maybe . if it would save his life .
do you think he stared the whole time like with each stab ?
i have no idea .
is he ok ?
i wouldn &apos;t be but ...
i &apos;m a blinker .
spence there you are .
grab your go bag .
what &apos;s going on ?
turn on the news .
which one ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
just after 8 : 00 this morning
40 @-@ year @-@ old darrin call
a lifelong resident of louisville
assaulted customers at the pharmacy
on the corner of main and truxton avenues .
eyewitnesses saw him walking east on main street
minutes after the attack .
he has not been seen since then .
we &apos;re going to louisville .
he was wearing a blue shirt jeans
and a light @-@ gray jacket .
within the hour the governor has called in all sources
for a manhunt .
despite these statewide efforts
the suspect has eluded law enforcement .
the body count is rising . 3 are confirmed dead--
including an armed bank guard
whose gun was used in the attack .
another 2 remain in critical condition .
the assailant is still out there .
we are going back to eric jennings
who &apos;s been talking to residents of louisville--
hey .
hey .
what do we know about this case in kentucky ?
uh there &apos;s no connection between call and his victims .
louisville p.d. &apos; s covered the city
but there hasn &apos;t been any sign of him
since he left the pharmacy .
you check his house family ?
locals are on it .
start with his most recent history .
find the stressor .
uh don &apos;t move .
ready ?
are you ?
so our point person in louisville
is lieutenant kevin mitchell .
good morning .
good to see you .
you too .
you look well sir. thank you .
how long do you have that ?
i &apos;m not really sure. welcome back .
thank you .
any other attacks ?
um no not yet .
call &apos;s proven hard to track .
he &apos;s never had a driver &apos;s license
so he &apos;s most likely still on foot .
or public transportation .
he &apos;s not gonna take the bus .
his face is everywhere .
has anyone found a stressor ?
he just lost his job .
he &apos;s worked at a factory since 1990 .
made appliances since forever and not a single promotion .
that &apos;s a long time to be bitter .
or he doesn &apos;t care .
not if he &apos;s got a family to feed .
actually he &apos;s of the hermit variety .
as far as i can tell he &apos;s got no one .
no wife no kids no parents .
nothing to live for .
so why hasn &apos;t he killed himself yet ?
sprees usually end in suicide .
if he &apos;s got nothing to live for why hasn &apos;t he ended it ?
&apos;cause he isn &apos;t finished yet .
we know he has displaced anger .
he took it out on the first victim .
well the stock boy represents someone. we need to know who .
is he military ?
negative .
well he &apos;s lashing out for a reason .
this guy &apos;s got anger endless targets and a gun
and he &apos;s just getting started .
emily dickinson wrote
&quot; one need not be a chamber to be haunted .
&quot; one need not be a house .
the brain has corridors surpassing material place . &quot;
all right .
we &apos;ve got checkpoints at the state line
on both i @-@ 64 and i @-@ 65
and within a 20 @-@ mile radius of downtown .
we think he &apos;s still on foot .
it &apos;s been just under 3 hours with an average walking speed
of 2.5 miles per hour which rounds up
to an approximate 8 @-@ mile radius .
now we &apos;ve concentrated here .
first responders started a hard @-@ target search
of businesses and residences within that 8 miles .
you &apos;re gonna join &apos; em. you know what he looks like .
go find him .
we dug up all we could on darrin call .
even went to his apartment. didn &apos;t find much .
we &apos;ve got agents over there now .
don &apos;t worry we &apos;ll fill it in .
what &apos;s your strategy ?
we try to figure out where he &apos;s headed next .
huh. you got a crystal ball ?
most spree killers are outwardly aggressive .
we &apos;ve studied call &apos;s behavior and he &apos;s defensive .
first victim--stock boy .
boy there &apos;s nothing defensive about that .
actually there is .
call doesn &apos;t react until he &apos;s touched .
and that &apos;s what set him off ?
happens every time .
contact then stab
contact stab .
so you &apos;re saying he didn &apos;t mean to hurt these people .
he didn &apos;t go in there with a weapon .
well now he &apos;s got 2 .
i just put his face all over the news .
people are gonna stop him themselves .
how soon can we have a press conference ?
the camera crews are out front .
great. let me call hotch .
who &apos;s that ?
our supervisor. he &apos;s at the crime scene already .
what is it about this kid ?
that &apos;s what we need to figure out .
call &apos;s apartment is 5 minutes from the pharmacy
but there &apos;s no sign
that he came here to wash off that blood .
how &apos;s he still on the street looking like that ?
maybe he &apos;s not .
garcia said he &apos;s got nobody. where would he go ?
call gets up he makes his bed .
we &apos;re sure he wasn &apos;t military ?
it looks like one neat aspect .
maybe he was hospitalized . i &apos;ll call garcia .
then he &apos;s probably got the same routine every day .
except today .
he finished his cereal walked to the pharmacy
and killed 3 people .
why ?
mr. call was always so quiet .
he &apos;s been coming here for years .
had he ever had a run @-@ in with the stock boy ?
john was new here . i waved him over .
i didn &apos;t know what else to do. no one else was helping .
he didn &apos;t turn violent until you gave him his prescription ?
well it wasn &apos;t his .
you handed him a bag .
it was somebody else &apos;s .
i just wanted him to calm down .
jj &apos;s press conference is in 5 minutes .
hotch we might have something else here .
why didn &apos;t you give him his own medication ?
well he didn &apos;t have any refills left .
for what ?
uh alprazolam .
but uh he used to be on thiothixene .
he was on an antipsychotic ?
well that &apos;s why i wanted him to calm down .
you said he used to be. how long has he been off of them ?
at least a month .
and when were you gonna tell us this ?
he &apos;s armed he &apos;s delusional .
who &apos;s his doctor ?
i don &apos;t remember. my computer .
great .
i &apos;m sorry .
great .
excuse us .
hotch .
call jj and tell her about the meds .
this is not her fault .
morgan he &apos;s in a psychotic break. it changes everything .
you want to talk about this ?
no ! i want to find him . garcia
he &apos;s been off his antipsychotic for a month .
what else did you miss ?
i &apos;m sorry sir . i didn &apos;t get his medical records yet so--
well find them. find everything .
yes ...
sir .
excuse me .
i &apos;m in a session !
i need the pills .
darrin what &apos;s wrong ?
what happened ?
he had a--a knife .
who ?
it &apos;s just like in the nightmares. he--
he &apos;s doing it again .
he can &apos;t hurt you .
we talked about this .
you want to remember .
it &apos;s why you &apos;re off the pills .
you said i would get better .
you are .
does it look like i &apos;m better ? !
darrin . darrin .
i gotta ... make it stop .
make it stop !
just make it--make it ... darrin ...
calm down . that &apos;s it . just look here .
just breathe .
take a breath .
he was unarmed . he didn &apos;t mean to hurt anyone .
all he wanted was his medication
but he didn &apos;t get it .
he needs help .
who &apos;s call &apos;s doctor ?
state appointed psychiatrist charles cipolla .
hotch and morgan are on their way .
where &apos;s his office ?
camden and third .
cipolla &apos;s not picking up .
gps says were 5 minutes away .
ok rossi we &apos;re 5 out .
tell mitchell to meet us there .
darrin ? uhh ! uhh !
darrin ?
uhh ! no !
no ! get it out ! darrin .
no !
darrin !
get it out !
no get it out !
can &apos;t get it--
i can &apos;t get it out !
i can &apos;t--gotta--
i gotta get it out !
darrin darrin here. here .
darrin ! darrin here .
take my shirt. just take it .
there you go that &apos;s good .
no ! don &apos;t touch him !
no ! oh my god !
no ! darrin no ! oh my god !
all right get out of here and check the perimeter. do it now .
we &apos;re too late .
hotch !
he cleaned up changed his clothes
could have dyed his hair for all i know .
call &apos;s suffering from a psychotic break .
he &apos;s not dodging us on purpose .
oh come on .
trust me .
if he was psychotic
why would his doctor take him off the drugs ?
call has no history of violent behavior .
cipolla couldn &apos;t predict that would happen .
look at this place .
yeah it &apos;s a mess .
no it &apos;s more than that .
call was looking for something .
yeah the drugs .
doctor doesn &apos;t keep the drugs here .
scrip pad is still on his desk .
my guess is he came here for help .
his file &apos;s missing .
yeah baby girl what &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s hotch ? he &apos;s not answering .
he &apos;s outside. he &apos;s all right .
are you sure ?
yeah. what &apos;s up ?
a mystery .
come on not today garcia .
i know. here &apos;s the deal .
when i missed the antipsychotics--
listen to me. that was not your fault .
you are ever my champion sugar
but i believe it was .
anyway when i did that i went back to the beginning
for call except there is no beginning .
wait a minute .
rossi .
say that again .
what are you talking about ?
darrin call didn &apos;t exist like from 1969 to 1975 .
there &apos;s no birth certificate no social security
no identity nothing until he was 6 years old .
was he abandoned ?
my least 3 favorite words strung together--
i don &apos;t know .
my guess is neither does he .
i should have seen the blinking on the video .
well it could have been a nervous tic .
but it wasn &apos;t. it &apos;s a classic sign
of long @-@ term antipsychotic use and i missed it .
we all did .
well regardless those men died .
garcia &apos;s got something .
may 1.1975 a 6 @-@ year @-@ old darrin call
was found roaming in the middle of nowhere and was picked up
and was in state care for the first few months .
did he tell the cops what happened ?
no. because he didn &apos;t talk
not for over a year. and once he started talking
he only knew his life as darrin call .
that &apos;s awful .
so is this. little darrin was never claimed .
maybe he wasn &apos;t from the area .
there wasn &apos;t a thriving missing children &apos;s network in 1975 .
call is wearing cipolla &apos;s clothing .
you think he &apos;s lucid ?
no mostly likely he &apos;s just freaked out .
either way we should update the public .
you should be there too .
what is this ?
call &apos;s timeline .
he left louisville ?
3 times .
always came back to the same 10 @-@ block radius .
why ?
victims are often drawn to the scene of their first trauma .
part of him wanted to escape
the other part probably struggled to find answers .
was he hospitalized ?
uh 1985 for 2 years .
yeah. and again in &apos; 95 for a few months
both at the state facility in fayette county .
you know he doesn &apos;t drive .
you think he &apos;d walk all the way out there ?
he &apos;s desperate. he &apos;ll find a way .
well then i &apos;ll tell the sheriff in fayette .
when did he start the prescriptions garcia ?
in 1977 and it looks like he tried them all .
i &apos;ve got a list .
alphabetically alprazolam
clonazepam diazepam--
just send it .
yes sir .
his doctor weaned him off the prescription for a reason .
now that &apos;s a big risk so the reward must have been greater .
he needs the truth .
he took his file .
he &apos;s got some answers .
and a head start .
well we need to catch up .
records from child services
has him extremely physically abused .
no signs of sexual assault .
that &apos;s a miracle .
either way the trauma was debilitating .
was he running from an abusive home or an abduction ?
wouldn &apos;t there be a paper trail if it were a kidnapping ?
garcia look for unsolved missing children &apos;s cases from the 1970s .
now there was a case
in hollow creek. kids were dead though .
found them in pieces .
when was this ?
&apos;75 .
nobody talks about it &apos; cause they never found the guy .
you think call walked away from that ?
it &apos;s possible .
garcia send me everything .
done .
can you find the case file ?
i &apos;ll do what i can .
you &apos;re it !
come on .
wait up !
is there a suspect list ?
it &apos;s in here somewhere .
he was known as the hollow creek killer .
3 bodies were found some never identified .
oh god he used lime to dispose--
there &apos;s a survivor .
call ?
no a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy named tommy phillips .
parents said he &apos;d been missing for 2 weeks
came back a different kid .
of course he did .
let &apos;s see. the family left louisville
after tommy told police where to find the bodies .
he also said the suspect was a white man in his 30s
and drove a red pickup truck .
we need to find tommy .
he &apos;d be 46 now .
his parents probably changed his name
and got as far away as possible .
garcia can find him .
don &apos;t get your hopes up .
garcia everything you can find
on a tommy phillips .
the victims had cuts .
the stock boy &apos;s blade
is what set him off in the pharmacy .
if this is what call &apos;s been running from
it &apos;s no wonder he &apos;s blocked it out .
since he &apos;s clean now there &apos;s no medication
to block his memories and he wants answers .
where would he go ?
to what he knows .
he doesn &apos;t know anything .
that &apos;s the problem .
he &apos;s beginning to . 1975 sterner orphanage .
it &apos;s where he became darrin call .
yes ?
there was a nice man here mr. cureton .
i need to see him .
i &apos;m sorry he retired years ago .
well where did he go ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m sorry .
you gotta know !
he didn &apos;t just leave .
i &apos;m sorry sir but i told you he &apos;s not here .
come on kids homework !
come on .
come on .
would you please leave ? the children are coming in. please .
come on . come on . straight to the books .
right to it . straight to the back and we &apos;ll sit down .
he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s here .
who ?
what are you talking about ?
nobody &apos;s here .
he &apos;s here .
i just--
oh careful ryan .
come on you can make it !
come on ! come on come on !
tommy tommy
we gotta go .
no wait--
stop it !
stop it ! stop it !
stop it !
come on tommy .
somebody help !
we gotta run !
somebody !
thank you .
he called the boy tommy .
is that what set him off ?
she thought it was his reflection .
whoever hurt him years ago
might have been the same age he is now .
he might have seen the similarity .
what about the boy ?
his real name is ryan .
she said he &apos;s quiet and submissive .
is morgan getting anything
out of the other witness ?
not yet .
a minivan was stolen one block from here .
call &apos;s never driven in his life .
you think he &apos;s still not running from us ?
which way ?
eastbound . i got roadblocks set up everywhere .
he &apos;s not getting out of this county .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
he &apos;s outnumbered .
you think he &apos;s gonna just disappear ?
i think he took the boy for a reason .
i don &apos;t care why he took him .
you should .
call &apos;s memory is no longer suppressed .
he &apos;s reinventing his past
and unless we understand how
we &apos;re not gonna find either of them .
well i &apos;m not gonna just sit around and speculate .
then don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t think we should chase him either ?
we need to get ahead of call .
there &apos;s a kid missing .
they don &apos;t need the extra manpower .
since when ?
if we &apos;d studied foyet &apos;s initial crimes
we would have known that a survivor didn &apos;t make sense .
what does he have to do with this ?
all we had to do was stop and look at foyet &apos;s history
and we didn &apos;t
and we lost two couples and a bus full of people .
and i &apos;m not making that mistake again .
they &apos;re gonna find us .
where ? you saw &apos; em ? where ?
who ?
where did you seem &apos; em ?
who ?
where did you see &apos; em ? ! where ? !
please just let me go .
i &apos;m sorry tommy .
just--
we just gotta-- we gotta--
just--ohh--we gotta--
we gotta hurry tommy
&apos;cause he &apos;s gonna get us and we just--
we just gotta--uhh--
so what do we know ?
there were only 4 suspects in the hollow creek case
and they &apos;re all dead .
the kids were taken in 1973 &apos; 74 and &apos; 75 .
and all on the way home from school .
different school districts .
he waited for them to be alone .
that takes patience .
he must have had time off in the afternoons .
he lived or worked near the schools .
that &apos;s a lot of doors to knock on .
you think call &apos;s going back there ?
i think there &apos;s a good chance .
i &apos;ll tell mitchell .
where &apos;s the secondary location ?
he needed seclusion to do what he did .
go ahead garcia . you &apos;re on speaker .
i found tommy . he goes by james thomas anderson now .
is he local ?
one county over . address and bio are coming ... now .
thanks garcia .
what does darrin call have to do with me ?
we think he survived the hollow creek murders .
nobody survived that .
you did .
there was another boy .
he was 6 .
no that &apos;s not true .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;m telling you i was alone .
just like now ?
excuse me ?
have you ever been married ?
any relationships ? any family ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
or are you afraid you &apos;ll abandon them too ?
or was it because of your alcoholism ?
i would never leave a kid .
did he cry too much ?
was he too slow ? what was it ?
how could you leave a 6 @-@ year @-@ old all alone ?
i was only 12 years old .
he &apos;s been taking medications to deal with the trauma
that suppressed his memories .
that kind of amnesia is a psychological defense .
he &apos;s gonna wish he never remembered .
we know what you told the police .
we need to know about the boy .
he never talked .
hey ! hey kid .
hey kid .
is the old man passed out yet ?
can you reach those ?
good. good. good .
good .
ok. bring &apos; em. please .
bring &apos; em here .
go ahead you can do it .
right there. good .
ok .
come on. come on !
come here .
grab the shovel .
hey come here !
quit struggling !
come here .
get out of there .
come on .
come on !
come on you can make it !
come on you can make it !
come on !
come on !
aah ! go tommy ! run !
go tommy ! run !
go tommy ! run !
i &apos;d never heard his voice before .
he told you to go .
he was a kid .
so were you .
call wasn &apos;t in the back with you .
no he was in the cab .
he gave you water .
got the keys .
why wasn &apos;t he locked up ?
maybe call wasn &apos;t a victim .
call &apos;s reflection .
oh god .
his father was the hollow creek killer .
his own kid ?
no wonder he was never claimed .
how did the father explain his son just disappeared ?
could have said he ran away .
the mother would have reported him missing .
maybe he said the boy died .
she &apos;d want a funeral .
what if there wasn &apos;t one ?
morgan call garcia .
ask her to check death records
from 1969 to 1975 .
for who ?
for the mother .
go tommy ! run !
go tommy run !
you think you can get away ? !
is that what you think ? !
you stupid little bastard .
have you narrowed it down ?
oh 6 years is a long time .
i need more parameters .
she lived within that 8 @-@ mile radius .
she was married. she was most likely in her twenties .
he was probably her only kid .
the husband drove a red truck .
ok. this could be one .
here we go doris jarvis. died in childbirth .
and let me guess-- she had a boy .
yeah .
baby girl i &apos;m gonna put you on speaker .
guys .
ok so doris jarvis
was married to bill jarvis .
he owned a machine shop just outside the city .
that could be the secondary location .
it closed in 1980 .
he hasn &apos;t done anything since .
i guess he laid low .
he had a red pickup
until 1976 when he bought a black one .
i know that because that &apos;s what he was driving
when he was arrested for duis .
he was locked up from &apos; 77 to &apos; 80
and i &apos;m sending his picture now .
and that could certainly be darrin call &apos;s father .
where &apos;s jarvis now ?
in the same house . 1457 hitchens avenue .
let &apos;s go .
... that &apos;s gonna do it .
there &apos;s no energy shortage here .
his third shot of the 1975 season .
we &apos;d like to remind you--
you &apos;re late .
of the game of the day .
patterson still walking around the mound .
we &apos;re not quite sure what is happening .
he &apos;s behind the count now
three balls one strike
with a man on first and second
here in the bottom of the eighth .
i knew you &apos;d come home .
lieutenant .
the kid &apos;s in there. we &apos;ve got this .
tactical teams are covering the exits .
call needs a distraction .
he &apos;s focused on the old man .
for now. but we &apos;re gonna have to figure out
the safest way to get that kid out .
i &apos;ve got a team in the back
and one on the way .
we &apos;re going to infiltrate .
you do that and someone else dies .
either call or a child murderer--
flip a coin .
it doesn &apos;t have to end like that .
we get a confession out of jarvis and he goes away
and call gets his answers .
no one else has to die .
hotch .
hotch .
hotch !
what the hell is he doing ? !
let him go .
rossi i &apos;m not letting him go in there solo .
we have to trust him .
we can do this together .
get out !
my name &apos;s aron .
this is between us and him .
i know .
then you leave us alone .
i know what he did to those boys .
i know about hollow creek and the cage .
and tommy .
you know about tommy ?
come on you can make it !
come on ! come on !
we &apos;re gonna get him back for everything that he done tommy .
every single thing .
let him go . tommy doesn &apos;t need to see this .
he should die .
he should . but if you kill him
you have nothing and i thought you wanted some answers .
what &apos;s he doing ?
stalling .
he &apos;s got nothing to lose .
go ahead darrin ask him .
why did you do that to those kids ?
what kids ?
no !
the ones that we buried. why ? !
you &apos;re confused .
no ! unh !
jarvis why didn &apos;t you move ?
this is my home .
you sure it &apos;s not the view ?
darrin come here .
come take a look at this .
he sits on the porch every day and watches those kids .
he can &apos;t help himself .
you got the shot ?
negative .
damn it .
what &apos;s he doing ?
bringing the boy out .
let &apos;s get hotch out of there .
that &apos;s his call .
we--we drove around in that truck .
you made your own son
sit in front so the other boys would feel safe ?
you--you kept them in cages .
i burnt their clothes .
and when you finished you &apos;d bury them
and you made him help .
and--
get up . pretend you &apos;re a man .
you like little boys don &apos;t you ?
but they can &apos;t be too small
&apos;cause that would be wrong .
what was it about them ? they make you feel strong
make you feel like a man ?
you shut up .

darrin .
we &apos;re surrounded here .
the police are gonna storm in here any minute .
they will not shoot you if you are unarmed .
you need to put the gun down now .

tommy ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
what for ?
for running away .
we both ran .
yeah but i left you behind .
he could have killed you .
he didn &apos;t .
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t afraid of him anymore .
you &apos;ve changed everything tommy .
you &apos;re the one that i waited for .
you &apos;re the one that saved me .
&quot; there is no witness so dreadful
&quot; no accuser so terrible
as the conscience that dwells in the heart of every man . &quot;
polybius .
i know what you want to talk about .
2 months ago we wouldn &apos;t be breaking down hotch &apos;s decisions .
there &apos;d be no doubt .
2 months ago he had everything to live for rossi .
now his family &apos;s just been taken away .
how is he supposed to think about anything else ?
how long is he gonna let foyet win ? hmm ?
i mean come on by the time we catch this guy
hotch could be more scarred on the inside than he is the outside .
hotch took a risk .
but we saved that boy .
he put his life at risk in there
in ways that we are never supposed to and you know it .
i &apos;m not about to stand by and watch this man kill himself .
and you won &apos;t .
rossi ...
if hotch is gone
foyet &apos;s got no one else to torture . hotch wins .
but if hotch lives but doesn &apos;t get to watch his son grow up
hotch loses .
you didn &apos;t have to walk me up here you know .
i know .
so you think call &apos;s gonna be ok ?
i don &apos;t know .
he got his answers .
he killed the man who haunted him .
and what else is there ?
the years of torture .
think he &apos;ll get over that ?
how could he ?
but at least he doesn &apos;t have to feel like he &apos;s alone anymore .
he doesn &apos;t have anyone .
he has tommy .
he &apos;s not alone .
get some sleep .
