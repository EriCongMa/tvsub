i am cutting you and your campaign off from my money .
natalie waters . i &apos;m new here .
there are still plenty of secrets out there .
everyone has them .
and sooner or later , i may even learn yours .
oh , i suspect it will be sooner .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been a death in the family .
i heard you got a medal from the mayor today .
and i left it , along with my badge and my gun ,
on the chief &apos;s desk .
why ?
turns out being a cop just wasn &apos;t the right thing for me .
i killed an fbi agent -- a bad one , but still --
and we lied about it .
i asked for evidence on emily .
they &apos;re in on this thing together .
use this to take them both out .
well , this is unexpected .
yeah , to me , too .
so ...
i should go .
and i should be playing first base for the yankees .
well , i guess some things just aren &apos;t meant to happen .
besides , i mean , where do you have to be
that &apos;s better than here ?
that &apos;s a fair point .
it &apos;s just my life hasn &apos;t
exactly allowed me to just ... be .
i truly can &apos;t imagine .
the past few years ,
everything i &apos;ve done ...
all i &apos;ve lost ...
and now ...
we don &apos;t have to do this .
do what ?
talk about our past .
then how am i gonna i learn all of your deep , dark secrets ?
oh , i @-@ i can assure you ,
my life &apos;s not nearly that interesting .
at least it wasn &apos;t ... until now .
and i don &apos;t mean to be the guy
that says there &apos;s something else
we could do besides talk ...
there &apos;s definitely something else
we could do besides talk .
ooh ! it &apos;s stunning .
margaux ...
thank you for coming .
my pleasure .
but it seems i &apos;m without my checkbook .
no ! oh , no , no , no .
it &apos;s not like that .
due to some sad news ,
my financial circumstance is about to change .
i received a phone call from an estate attorney ,
and he informed me that daniel &apos;s grandfather ,
edward grayson , had passed away .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , he was a good man .
the reading of the will is later today .
that must be quite the inheritance .
edward and i always had a special bond .
and even when conrad and i divorced ,
edward reached out to assure me
that i still had a place in his heart
and in his will .
he was always the practical one .
what better way to pay tribute to mr. grayson &apos;s memory
than to use the inheritance
for a place his great @-@ grandchild could enjoy ?
well , the real tribute
will be to use the money to help daniel &apos;s foundation .
what would you think if i were to turn one of the bedrooms
into a nursery for you and the baby ?
you &apos;re too kind , victoria .
oh , i could say the same of you
for having followed my advice .
i saw you at the ross reception ,
and from what i inferred ,
you dropped your vendetta against emily
in your pursuit to clear daniel &apos;s name .
you needn &apos;t worry about anything
other than picking out a crib .
you quit so fast you didn &apos;t have time to clean out your locker ?
i had an event to get to .
look , i knew you were having a hard time , but ...
i had no idea how bad it was .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault .
still , i &apos;ll miss riding with you .
i think we made a good team , there .
it &apos;s nothing personal , ben .
will i see you around ?
yeah .
seems like we have some of the same friends now .
guess that &apos;s it .
so , what &apos;s jack porter doing next ?
something i should &apos;ve done a long time ago .
emily was seen leaving ben hunter &apos;s place this morning .
see what you can dig up on him .
why am i still spinning my wheels on this ?
i gave you video of jack porter
admitting that he killed an fbi agent .
lest you forget , this is about destroying emily &apos;s reputation
the same way she did daniel &apos;s .
and know this -- nothing will go to waste .
that video will be the first domino
in exposing who she really is .
sorry to interrupt .
here are the quarterly reports you asked for .
merci , simone .
thanks to the video ,
by tomorrow morning , the world will have
a very different opinion of emily thorne .
buongiorno , mio marito !
are we italian now ?
well , we will be in about eight shakes of a turkey leg .
mm , more or less .
because what is the wedding of the century
without an equally extravagant honeymoon ?
italy , huh ?
mm , whereabout ?
wherever the espresso &apos;s hot and the men are hotter .
well , i hear florence is nice this time of year .
great ! so pack a bag ...
or just a credit card .
my jet &apos;s getting fueled up as we speak ,
so we &apos;ll be good to go within the hour .
arrivederci !
you know how you said you &apos;d pay me
for any useful information ?
yeah .
margaux has video footage
that she plans to use against emily .
footage of what ?
i &apos;m not sure , but she &apos;s releasing it tomorrow .
all right , simone , you have to get this for me .
i &apos;ll try , but margaux &apos;s being very protective about it .
i can &apos;t lose my job over this .
well , i &apos;ll get you a new one ,
even if that means i have to start a magazine .
do whatever it takes .
il tuo culo sembra buono in quei pantalones .
that means , &quot; your butt looks good in those pants . &quot;
what ?
um , something came up .
i can &apos;t leave right now .
well , how much time do you need -- two , three hours ?
oh , probably a little more than that .
why don &apos;t you go without me ?
it &apos;s our honeymoon !
well ... i &apos;ll catch up with you in a day or so ,
and , uh , in the meantime ,
you can taste @-@ test your way to the best gelateria .
of course .
gelato . yay .
who the hell are ralph and alice ?
edward grayson &apos;s corgis .
i &apos;m sorry . what is that word ?
you &apos;re getting his dogs .
it says here they &apos;re being flown in
from scottsdale next week -- first class .
that &apos;s it ?
there has to be some mistake .
oh , wait , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re also getting their burberry dog beds .
i just need your signature
here , here , and initial here .
what about the inheritance ?
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. grayson .
the remainder of edward grayson &apos;s estate
is being left to his wife .
his wife ?
she died 20 years ago .
so sorry i &apos;m late .
you &apos;re edward &apos;s wife ? that was your secret ?
you &apos;ve got to admit , it &apos;s a good one .
well , the last time i spoke with him ,
he wasn &apos;t dating , nor was he revising his will .
what kind of scam is this ?
this is no scam .
teddy and i were married four months ago ,
so your conversation was not a recent one .
your husband dies a week ago ,
and the first thing you do
is hop on a plane to the hamptons ,
and rather than telling me
that my father @-@ in @-@ law passed away ,
you spend two days concealing your true identity .
and for what ?
to go party @-@ hopping ,
or to embarrass me in front of my friends ?
i &apos;ll give you ladies some privacy .
oh , we don &apos;t need privacy . we need a judge .
this will is fraudulent .
i came to the hamptons early
to see what kind of a person you are ,
to meet you in a circumstance
where you &apos;re not predisposed to hate me .
and maybe i would &apos;ve shown you some kindness .
but to see you rake your friends over the coals ?
you are just as vicious as teddy made you out to be .
edward adored me .
and he always promised to look after my family .
as a matter of fact ,
he reviewed his will with me ,
and i know full well what was coming to me
and to my son , daniel .
well , all i know
is that shortly after conrad &apos;s arrest ,
teddy &apos;s illness took a turn ,
and when he tried to reach out to you ,
you were nowhere to be found .
so when the going got tough , you jumped ship .
i did no such thing .
but you know what was curious ?
after my son passed away ,
i left multiple messages for edward .
now , are you the reason why he never called me back ?
i thought it best to keep his spirits up ,
because you had done enough damage .
what you did to his heart ...
not even this nurse could help .
you were his nurse ?
oh , well , this couldn &apos;t be more transparent .
you took advantage of an ailing man
who was clearly wasn &apos;t in his right mind .
any judge will see that .
teddy was clear @-@ minded to the end ,
and he thought the very worst of you ,
which is why he left you two incontinent dogs
and me everything else .
not losing any sleep
over what the rest of the world thinks about me .
i killed an fbi agent .
is there more ?
that was all simone could retrieve before almost getting caught .
now she &apos;s worried margaux &apos;s on to her , so ...
it &apos;s up to us .
i should &apos;ve known margaux was too smart to play dumb .
god , if this gets out ...
it &apos;s gonna destroy jack .
how much time do we have ?
she &apos;s releasing it tomorrow .
well , then , we &apos;d better get hacking .
if your computer system &apos;s been compromised ,
it &apos;s likely to be a cyber attack .
we &apos;ll send over a task force .
the computer in question is air @-@ gapped ,
which means it &apos;s untouched by the internet
and therefore unhackable .
someone broke in to the server room
to get at it at 10 : 37 .
you know the exact moment ?
i receive an alert
anytime the computer is turned on .
by the time i got to it , the server room was empty .
do you have any idea what they were after ?
not sure .
it &apos;s possible i arrived before they could finish the job .
well , we have your visitors &apos; log
and your security footage ,
so we &apos;ll start there .
in the meantime , do you know anyone
who could be targeting you ?
i am the ceo
of an international media conglomerate , agent lin .
that makes me ...
everybody &apos;s target .
but a midday break @-@ in ?
good money &apos;s on an inside job .
find the sea glass !
hey , jack !
nice suit .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
ah , it &apos;s just ... old friend of mine ...
he wants me to join his firm .
i &apos;m supposed to meet him and talk about it .
nice . that sounds like a good opportunity .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna go .
stepping back into that world , i just , uh , i don &apos;t feel
like it &apos;s what i &apos;m supposed to do .
not that i know what i should be doing .
you &apos;re rebuilding a relationship with your daughter .
that &apos;s no small thing .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t really feel like a full @-@ time job .
look , no one knows what the future holds ,
but if you &apos;re an optimist ,
that ... just means anything is possible .
last time that i knew what i should be doing with my life
was the summer that i bought the beach house --
just fixing it up a little bit at a time .
yeah .
i know what you mean , yeah .
f @-@ for me it was the , uh ...
it was the boat .
i was gonna sail to haiti .
that was ... three years ago .
what stopped you ?
my dad died .
and then i , uh ,
i had to stick around and take care of my little brother .
and your daughter showed up .
you two used to love scouring the beach for sea glass .
yeah .
we would lay them all out
and see which ones were worth keeping .
you guys ... you were inseparable .
that never really changed , did it ?
that looks like a pretty good one .
yeah .
yeah , it sure does .
come in .
emily ?
jack , hi .
we need to talk .
i know .
wait , you ... you do ?
and i don &apos;t know the extent
of the footage that margaux has ,
but we will figure it out .
what are you talking about ?
nolan didn &apos;t call you ?
i was about to .
now you get to tell him .
tell me what ?
what -- what &apos;s going on ?
margaux has a video of us talking about kate .
you admit to killing her ,
and we both cop to covering it up .
and so , what , she &apos;s gonna release it ?
she &apos;s gonna try .
have you seen the video ?
just a clip of it . i &apos;ll pull it up .
i killed an fbi agent -- a bad one ...
damn it !
if this thing gets released , my life is over .
are you sure you can &apos;t get
into lemarchal &apos;s computer system ?
this specific computer is unhackable ,
but margaux &apos;s security system is not .
wait , you guys are breaking in ?
tonight .
the only way to get the file is to steal the computer .
no , it &apos;s not .
last night , margaux and i had
our first real conversation since we split .
it was almost like we were friends .
i will talk to her .
no , you could make things worse .
i don &apos;t want her tipped off .
and i don &apos;t want the truth coming out .
it &apos;s my ass on the line .
i killed an fbi agent -- me !
i can &apos;t leave anything to chance .
now , if that means confronting margaux head @-@ on , so be it .
all right , you have to trust me .
not this time .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
yeah , you &apos;d better ,
because margaux cannot know we &apos;re coming .
and how is my favorite unreal housewife ?
well , i was hoping you would have caught
a ride out of town on mama &apos;s broom .
and miss the moment you come to your senses ?
and which senses would those be ,
the ones where i decide to finance
your anemic political campaign ?
anything for your friend , mrs. ross ?
oh , no , dear , he won &apos;t be staying .
&quot; mrs. ross &quot; ?
now , come on . you won .
you got your money .
must you sit here and make a mockery out of marriage ?
look , nolan and i have more affection for each other
than most couples i know .
well , then , pray tell -- where is he ?
he had some work to do .
the man does not have a job ,
except for making sure this place keeps you well @-@ hydrated .
day after your reception , here you sit alone .
your marriage is a sham . everybody knows it .
well , at least i &apos;m creating a life for myself ,
which is a whole lot more than i can say for you .
your campaign is sinking ,
and , well golly , that is just all you have .
silly girl .
you should know better than to doubt me .
i always find a way to come out on top .
what about stickley furniture ?
do you know of any local collectors ?
you lost me at &quot; stickley . &quot;
so that would be a &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s an antique dealer ...
a few miles down the road .
you &apos;re david clarke .
yeah , i am .
natalie waters .
a person who obviously watches the news .
ah . nice to meet you .
you , uh , in the market for mission furniture ?
actually , i &apos;m just trying to find a good home for a couple of chairs ,
and a set of antique spoons ,
and more golf clubs than you can possibly imagine ,
among other things .
i recently lost someone ,
and this is my inheritance .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
thank you .
it &apos;s , um ... it &apos;s been overwhelming .
i &apos;m just trying to place these items
with people who will appreciate them
as much as he did .
so , uh if you know anyone
who has a thing for , uh ...
russian nesting dolls ...
oh , wow , yeah .
doesn &apos;t everyone ?
what &apos;s your plan for that ketch ?
the boat ?
to give it to the nice man i met at the bar ...
if he promises to take care of it .
well , you shouldn &apos;t give it away .
you should ask the nice man
for fair market value .
okay .
how about you buy me a drink ... and it &apos;s yours ?
i don &apos;t understand .
wills are contested all the time .
okay .
i could take this on
and chalk up a bunch of billable hours ,
but based on your current financial situation .
that woman is a criminal .
she duped a dying man out of millions ,
my millions .
i &apos;m sorry , victoria .
i &apos;m not sure if you can even afford this hour .
my apologies .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
no one ever means that .
lyman ellis ,
future congressman , current lawyer ,
and the man who will take on your case .
do i know you ?
you know my sister , louise .
now , i saw you , at her reception ,
raise more money in one hour
than i &apos;ve seen at any political fundraiser .
you &apos;re scrappy .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. ellis ,
but the answer is no .
and i haven &apos;t even asked you a question yet .
like i said , scrappy .
now , what would you say if i told you
i could get you your money ,
all of it ?
i would insist that you first tell me
why i should believe you .
well , i understand how it feels
to be screwed out of an inheritance .
and like you ,
i &apos;m willing to do whatever it takes .
so wouldn &apos;t it be prudent for us to pool our energies
to make sure you get back what is rightfully yours ?
i need a lawyer , not an opportunist .
well , it &apos;s a good thing for you that i &apos;m both .
well , what &apos;s in it for you ?
20 % , based on what i accidentally overheard ,
that should be more than enough
to fund my campaign through election day .
mrs. grayson , if i lose ,
20 % of nothing is nothing .
you could not ask for a better proposition .
prove to me your worth .
if you find something useful ,
i &apos;ll consider it .
thanks for meeting me .
we need to talk .
i can &apos;t believe how big carl is .
i &apos;m glad you brought him along .
well , i didn &apos;t have much of a choice .
daycare closed early ,
so daddy day in the park .
what did you want to talk about ?
well , it &apos;s gonna ... sound stupid ,
but after we talked yesterday , i--
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about how we broke up
and how i said some things that weren &apos;t fair ,
and ... i just ,
i thought that i should call .
to be honest , i did some things that weren &apos;t fair .
well , i just want you to know
that going forward ...
i &apos;m here for you ,
single parent to single parent .
i appreciate that .
i can &apos;t quite fathom
how much my life will change--
not just emotionally , but practically .
when was the last time
you were able to do something spontaneous ?
okay .
i , um -- the other night ,
i got out of bed and made myself
a grilled cheese sandwich .
no planning . i just did it .
oh , so you &apos;re saying
i should savor the theater this evening ?
well , i &apos;d never tell you what to do ,
but i will say ...
what is the theater again ?
some pep talk .
look , it &apos;s just that , you know ,
y @-@ your priorities change .
you get a new perspective .
you know , now every decision that i make ,
i think , &quot; how is this gonna affect carl ? &quot; you know .
what , what kind of example am i setting ?
yeah , it is a lot to consider .
hey , buddy !
hey !
no , give it to her . nice !
you &apos;re giving that to me ?
thank you .
it &apos;s a limited edition .
you don &apos;t actually have to wear it .
the things a parent does for their child .
you &apos;ll know soon enough .
ready to prove your worth ?
natalie waters began working
for edward grayson six months ago
as his private nurse ,
while she was still married .
a few weeks in , she got a quickie divorce ,
followed by an even quicker marriage to mr. grayson .
and ... ?
that &apos;s a matter of public record .
where &apos;s the dirt ?
it seems that nurse waters is anything but .
she had her credentials stripped
after she was fired from a hospital
for swindling a patient out of money .
so that goes to a pattern of behavior ,
which is why i have already
filed the paperwork to contest the will .
well , that sounds more like a lawyer talking .
a lawyer ?
my lawyer .
hey , i thought you &apos;d be halfway to italy by now .
i &apos;ve seen italy .
i wanted to see it with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just--
yeah , something came up . i know .
look ,
i realize you did me this huge favor ,
for which i &apos;m eternally grateful ,
but i wouldn &apos;t have married you
if i didn &apos;t like you .
and , yes , i got control of my money , but ...
i also got a friend in the process .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;ll have my lawyer
draft divorce papers and set you free .
oh , louise .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s not that at all .
i @-@ i love spending time with you ,
and italy sounds perfect .
but ...
there &apos;s that &quot; but &quot; again--
and not the &quot; looks good in those pants &quot; kind .
okay , today ...
something important came up .
and the thing is ...
emily and i ...
you &apos;re sleeping together ?
no , no , no .
no . um ... emily and i ...
oh , god . how do i explain this ?
we &apos;re sort of like superheroes .
but i thought we were the wonder twins .
you &apos;re serious .
w @-@ well ... only in the sense that we do , uh ,
well , good things for people who deserve it ,
and ... bad things to those who don &apos;t .
and what are you on today ,
a mission of mercy or malice ?
how does ... &quot; merciful malice &quot; suit you ?
like la perla .
maybe i can help .
emily !
training for a mud run ?
i &apos;d tell you , but i &apos;d have to kill you .
and i &apos;d like to keep you around ...
for your witty repartee .
oh , well , now the pressure &apos;s on .
let me ask you something .
did you see jack today ?
yeah .
did you get the sense that he knows about us ?
not that there &apos;s an &quot; us , &quot; per se , but ...
it didn &apos;t come up . why ?
i @-@ i @-@ i saw him at the station house this morning .
he made a comment about us traveling in the same circles .
well , maybe i &apos;m reading too much into it .
so , you got plans tonight ?
um , yeah , actually .
i &apos;d ask what , but i wouldn &apos;t want you
to have to kill me in front of all these people .
how &apos;d it go with jack ?
he &apos;s a good man
who unfortunately is friends with the wrong person .
but he tried to play me ,
just like you played nolan .
you &apos;re better at it .
so we &apos;re still moving forward , then ?
call the fbi .
i want them to be there to spoil all of her fun .
tonight , emily thorne will finally get what she deserves .
i &apos;m in position .
and mission em @-@ possible is a go .
all right , i &apos;m deactivating the alarm on the northeast corner .
ems ?
ems ?
i &apos;m good .
all right . you &apos;re making my palms sweat .
you &apos;re clear .
i &apos;m going in .
and north hallway &apos;s clear .
stop right there !
oh , my goodness .
this isn &apos;t soul cycle .
louise ? !
you know her ?
gosh darn it , i could have sworn
jack said the gym was on the eighth floor .
jack sent you here ?
or was it eighth avenue ?
you know , i am so terrible with directions .
i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt .
um , ma &apos;am ?
yes ?
agent westgate here is gonna need to ask you
a few questions before you go .
oh . my pleasure .
this way , ma &apos;am .
okay , so , a few questions , and then what ?
well , if there &apos;s nothing suspicious ,
then she &apos;s free to go -- standard operating procedure .
she &apos;s going to lie .
that woman is working with them !
who &apos;s &quot; them &quot; ?
i &apos;ll show you .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to , ms. lemarchal ,
but this is clearly a waste of agency resources .
good night , ma &apos;am .
are you sure you want to part with your husband &apos;s cuban cigars ?
knowing yours would enjoy them
is all that matters .
it &apos;s what teddy would &apos;ve wanted .
well , then ... to teddy .
to teddy .
excuse me , are you the natalie waters
with the stickley chairs ?
i am .
consider yourself served .
what is it ?
teddy &apos;s will is being contested .
does this mean i &apos;m not getting the cigars ?
you didn &apos;t think i was going to allow you
to dupe my father @-@ in @-@ law and lie to his heir , did you ?
i loved him .
what exactly did you love most ,
the fact that he was worth millions ,
or that he was on death &apos;s doorstep ?
i think it was both .
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t i ?
i &apos;ve known women like you .
in fact , i &apos;ve been accused of being a woman like you .
so you don &apos;t fool me for a second .
when i started working for teddy ,
my life was falling apart .
i was in a horrible marriage .
well , sure . you were poor .
and every day ,
when i arrived to work , teddy , despite his illness ,
showed me more kindness than anyone ever has .
i know it may be difficult for small @-@ minded people to comprehend ,
but we fell in love .
so , while our marriage may have been brief ,
our love , nevertheless , was real .
and if giving you his entire estate
would bring him back , i would .
well , why don &apos;t you try ?
you never know .
teddy saved my life ,
and i would do anything for him .
and that includes protecting his fortune
from the likes of you .
trying to get me on a b &amp; e ?
was that the best you could do ?
should &apos;ve brought your fbi pals up here ,
because i both broke and entered .
nice try , though .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
a word of advice ...
if you &apos;re gonna keep coming at me ,
you &apos;re gonna have to be a hell of a lot smarter .
you think you &apos;re invincible .
not invincible .
just ... better .
i will find your weak spot .
let me save you the trouble .
i don &apos;t have one .
oh , and , uh , by the way ...
nice bracelet .
oh , no !
hey , natalie ?
what do you think ?
hi . i think i owe you an apology .
it appears i gave you the first boat ever made .
well , 15 years , uh ,
sitting in a harbor will do that .
but i wanted a project , so no apology necessary .
well , then , you &apos;re welcome .
have a good night .
is it true ... that you &apos;re a grayson ?
knowing your history ,
it didn &apos;t seem like a good thing to lead with .
you may have thought i had an ulterior motive .
should i be worried there &apos;s a crack in the hull ?
full disclosure ...
the only reason i would sink this ship
is if victoria grayson were on it .
i &apos;m sorry .
you guys aren &apos;t still ...
no , no , we &apos;ve moved on .
okay .
w-- besides , i would never let
all your hard work to honor teddy go to waste .
well , if you call listening to the cubs game
and drinking beer working , then ...
considering how they &apos;ve been playing lately ,
it does feel like a job ,
so i guess it qualifies .
well , they &apos;re down eight in the second , so ...
wait , do you want to join ?
what &apos;s misery without a little company , right ?
so this little doohickey
erased margaux &apos;s entire computer ?
worked like a charm .
uh , now let &apos;s put that away before you do the same to mine .
well , thank you for trusting me .
i don &apos;t .
seriously .
let &apos;s put that away .
you know , i know i didn &apos;t do much , but ...
it was nice to feel included .
i am so sorry i didn &apos;t see it sooner .
see what ?
how much we &apos;re alike .
i mean , i s @-@ spent most of my life as an outsider ,
and it it felt awful .
but then emily showed up
and trusted me to be her partner ,
and ... my life changed .
so , while our wedding was strategic ...
i did promise to be there for you .
i &apos;m so sorry that i wasn &apos;t .
perdonami ?
yes .
you served natalie the papers ?
well , isn &apos;t that why you had them drawn up ?
you completely jumped the gun .
now her public declaration &apos;s all over tmi .
she &apos;s become the anti @-@ anna nicole .
i helped you .
how , by not giving me
sufficient time to build my case ?
by getting her to declare her love
publicly and on the record .
we now have a narrative to ruin .
how ? did you see her ?
she was ... emotional and sincere .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ve just gone through so much lately , and ...
i @-@ i wanted to find some way to help .
it &apos;s okay , victoria .
don &apos;t beat yourself up about it .
emotion and sincerity can be faked . please .
point made .
natalie &apos;s sob story
now exists for us to dismantle piece by piece .
even if that means fabricating information ?
talking like a lawyer ...
but thinking like a politician .
i truly am the best of both worlds .
and in my short time here ,
i can see that honesty does not get you very far ,
so who am i to break with tradition ?
hear , hear .
miss lemarchal .
is everything okay ?
you tell me .
that &apos;s april .
are you looking for my ex @-@ wife ?
no .
no , i found her .
you know where she is ?
which makes one of us .
and if you don &apos;t do as i ask ,
i could let another person know where she is --
someone who wants to find her
for a completely different reason .
what do you want ?
it worked .
you &apos;re in the clear .
thanks .
thank you .
we all did our part .
i know about you and ben .
and ?
and you have to know ...
that there &apos;s someone out there who &apos;s a better fit for you .
i realize that my timing is terrible .
i get that . but ...
after aiden ...
i know what it means to lose someone ,
and i was --i was trying to give you space .
so you &apos;re doing this now
because you think i &apos;ve moved on with ben ?
jack -- - i &apos;m doing this now
because i can &apos;t watch you be with anyone else ,
because for once ,
we are both in a place to maybe start a relationship ,
and after everything that we &apos;ve been through ,
and at a time when i don &apos;t know what the future holds ,
i have one certainty in my life , emily ... one .
and that is how i feel about you .
it &apos;s always been you ...
from the moment sammy ran up to you that day .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
things between us , jack , they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re messy .
life is messy .
but ... you find a way .
you have done and sacrificed so much for me .
you know how much i care about you .
but ...
but what ?
i can &apos;t , jack .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not gonna wait around .
