gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you shouldn &apos;t have sent that video in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i didn &apos;t do it .
if you didn &apos;t do it and i didn &apos;t ,
then who did ?
of course i love you , chuck . i &apos;ve always loved you .
humphrey , you bastard .
you and your family will quite literally pay the consequences .
or did you forget about the dowry ?
if she defaults on the marriage , the dowry can be reinstated .
you do not have to go with him .
it &apos;s just a year . it &apos;s not that long , right ?
this is estee , a.k.a. my royal minder ,
but i &apos;ve just been calling her &quot; creeper &quot; for short .
i do have feelings for dan . i &apos;m sorry .
this isn &apos;t gonna be easy for me ,
but at least you &apos;re being honest .
i don &apos;t want to get in the way of you and dan .
i think we need to get her to the hospital .
please stay with me .
you &apos;re the only person i feel safe with .
i won &apos;t leave you . i promise .
oh ! mother ?
charlie , what are you doing here ?
she &apos;s been with ms. rhodes for months .
she &apos;s been such a solace to her .
mom ?
why did you introduce this girl as your daughter ?
who is she ?
ivy dickens .
your mom hired me to be you .
you hid an entire family from me for money ?
i don &apos;t really wanna be alone . can i stay with you ?
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
you need to go in and say your good @-@ byes .
they say we should carry our secrets to the grave .
but on the upper east side ,
secrets are the one thing you can never bury .
even when we think we know everything about the ones we love ,
there &apos;s always a skeleton in their walk @-@ in closet .
thank you for seeing me on such short notice .
mrs. humphrey , in my business , there &apos;s rarely advance warning .
oh , of course . i just wanted to make sure
all of mother &apos;s funeral arrangements were perfect .
she was very particular , liked things a certain way .
um , would it be possible for us to work with our own florist ?
oh . i &apos;m ... sorry .
i thought you knew .
your mother provided very detailed instructions .
in fact , if you return home right about now ,
i think you &apos;ll discover the wake is already underway .
well , i can hear my mother laughing from beyond the grave .
i &apos;m sure she just didn &apos;t want to bother you
with making all the arrangements .
or she just didn &apos;t trust your taste level .
i &apos;m the other daughter , carol .
crashing as usual .
well , since you &apos;re here , you might want to know
that it seems mother took care of everything in advance .
i &apos;d tell you to invite your daughter--
the real one , not the fake one--
but she &apos;s not speaking to you .
well , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i apparently have a wake to host .
aren &apos;t you gonna be late for work ?
or you pulling a &quot; vanilla sky &quot;
and hiding your hideous disfigurement
from your global publishing empire ?
what ? i thought you found
my lacrosse injury sexy . no ?
besides , i figured we could spend the day together
and catch up .
no . no .
don &apos;t give me that &quot; let &apos;s talk about our feelings &quot; face .
what ? this is normal face . okay ?
no , i &apos;m worried about you . in the past 72 hours ,
you found out that you have this entire secret family .
yeah , and my mom hired an actress i know to play me .
i &apos;m aware .
then why haven &apos;t you said a word about it ?
i may not have known about the van der woodsens
for the last 19 years ,
but they sure knew about me .
and they didn &apos;t care ,
so that pretty much tells me everything i need to know
about your fancy friends from the upper east side .
now buy a girl some breakfast ?
all right . two minutes .
get dressed . i &apos;ll make coffee .
hey . how you holding up ?
well , the past few days have been tough on everyone .
but i @-@ i have a question .
are you with lola ?
she hasn &apos;t been answering any of my calls or texts .
ahh . yeah . she &apos;s ...
not really that interested in being a rhodes right now .
well , trust me , i know what it &apos;s like
to want distance from your family more than anyone .
but i thought maybe with cece &apos;s death , she &apos;d make an exception .
well , i &apos;m not so sure .
the entire van der woodsen clan on a good day
can be pretty overwhelming .
well , i have an idea . maybe ... you know , maybe she can
just dip her toes in the water with just me ?
i &apos;m at my mom &apos;s right now . no one else is here .
they &apos;ll be at the funeral home for a while .
maybe the three of us can meet up .
i mean , i &apos;ll ask her . i just can &apos;t promise you anything .
thank you , nate .
coffee ?
top drawer .
it relaxes me to watch anita durst .
i did not need to know that .
what &apos;s got you in such a good mood ?
i recently found out
who actually sent &quot; gossip girl &quot;
the now @-@ infamous video of me and blair
at the royal wedding-- that hump , humphrey .
what , dan ?
he was only too happy to let serena and me take the fall
so he could worm his way into blair &apos;s broken heart .
unfortunately for him , when she finds out the truth ,
his chances with her will be destroyed ,
and she will be mine again .
i don &apos;t know , chuck . are you sure
you want to start world war waldorf right now ?
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
&apos;cause you and i both know
that nothing can actually happen between dan and blair
for at least a year .
so ... a lot can change in 12 months .
take the high road .
grab your coat . i &apos;m kidnapping you
and taking you to a bona fide humphrey brunch .
ah . bien sur . merci . nous parlerons demain .
so for those of us who took italian ,
what was that all about ?
that was cyrus and another attorney at his firm .
they think they may have found a loophole in my prenup .
are you serious ?
yes . apparently , since we signed it in monaco
but got married in the u.s.--
you can contest it .
oh , we can try .
cyrus thinks the grimaldis may have to grant me
an amicable annulment ,
meaning that they &apos;d waive my dowry ...
and you wouldn &apos;t have to wait the year for ...
anything .
when will cyrus know for sure ?
well , he &apos;s supposed to talk
to the grimaldis &apos; royal attorney in an hour ,
so rain check on that waffle ? i should wait here ...
hopefully for the last time .
no .
delete . delete .
what are you doing ?
trying to help .
no , you &apos;re not .
if you were , you wouldn &apos;t let me slave in front of this computer
all day as &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
well , i thought you said knowing everyone &apos;s secrets
as &quot; gossip girl &quot; was your dream come true .
it was , until i realized how much work it is .
i mean , look at me . i &apos;m exhausted and aggravated .
i have no social life to speak of .
i feel like a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom .
oh , honey , don &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s true . i mean , all my life i &apos;ve been the one
that they write stories about , and now i &apos;m just
another anonymous shut @-@ in with an online shopping addiction .
tell me , what can i do ?
well ...
since you asked ,
georgina sparks needs a recharge ,
so i &apos;ve decided to take a mental health day ,
and i &apos;ve found the perfect event to crash--
cece rhodes &apos; secret wake .
what about &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
the site can &apos;t go down all day .
it won &apos;t .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m leaving you in charge .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s not rocket science .
you just take the tips that people send in
and post them if they &apos;re worthy .
are you sure this is such a good idea ?
aw , what &apos;s a van der woodsen family event
if i &apos;m not there to ruin it ?
besides , i already promised a new friend
i &apos;d be her plus one .
thank you for coming with me .
i know i was invited , but , uh ,
i don &apos;t think i could face them all alone .
i understand . when everybody at a party hates you ,
who better to bring than someone they hate even more ?
what are you doing down here ?
i thought there was a family breakfast this morning .
oh , there &apos;s a lot more than that going on upstairs .
i just came down to warn my mom .
you &apos;ll see for yourself .
is blair &apos;s houseboy up there ?
you mean dan ?
is that why you came by--
to get intell on him and blair , torture him a little ?
maybe just a little .
well , he &apos;s not here . at least , not yet .
but , here &apos;s some intel for you .
blair just texted me
that cyrus may have found a loophole in her prenup ,
so she may be released sooner than any of us thought .
and right into dan &apos;s waiting arms .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
主题 : 丹 · 汉弗瑞
so what do you wanna do for breakfast ?
oh , i was thinking untitled at the whitney--
danny meyer &apos;s new place ?
oh , you &apos;re trying to score a cool point , aren &apos;t you ?
and since we &apos;ll be on madison anyway ...
oh , here it comes .
well , we &apos;ll be walking right by serena &apos;s mom &apos;s ,
which serena will be at by herself , i might add .
nate , what part of wanting nothing to do
with the van der woodsens don &apos;t you understand ?
look , i know how you feel about them ,
but not everything from the upper east side
is automatically bad .
okay . name one thing that isn &apos;t .
me . come on .
serena &apos;s one of my best friends , okay ?
you haven &apos;t even given her one shot . what &apos;s the harm ?
all right , but if we stop by ,
you have to promise me
that you &apos;re never gonna play me like this again , okay ?
i promise .
mom , you knew grandma always did like to do things her own way .
i know . i &apos;m just not entirely sure i &apos;m in the mood
for the &quot; mayflower &quot; mausoleum in mother &apos;s honor
that obviously awaits us upstairs .
oh , my god .
it was all here when i got home .
there &apos;s whiskey and stew ...
and mother .
and those are our mourners &apos; chairs
where we will sit and mourn
because this is an irish wake .
looks like this wake might end up being the wake @-@ up call
you so desperately need .
copy ...
paste ...
post .
oh , no .
oh , crap .
i just can &apos;t believe that this was mother &apos;s idea .
and who are these people ? i don &apos;t recognize a soul .
well , i guess cece wanted us to celebrate her life
and not mourn her death , so she didn &apos;t invite
any of her stodgy socialites , just the ...
the help .
that--that--that was her butcher from east hampton ,
and her driver .
and the fireman that saved her life
the night she left the candle burning .
hi .
you . what are you doing here ?
i was invited by your mother herself .
i promised her i &apos;d come .
i just came to pay my respects . i won &apos;t bother anybody .
this is all carol &apos;s fault .
yeah , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s hiding here somewhere .
you can &apos;t let carol get to you like this .
the executor of the estate is supposed to be coming ,
whoever that is .
my money is on elias the gardener .
and i &apos;m sure everything will be explained
once they read the will .
well , whoever it is , they &apos;d better get here soon ,
because i &apos;m not responsible for what i might do .
so serena &apos;s here alone , huh ?
i swear i had no idea what we were walking into .
so this is an epic fail .
yeah , let &apos;s just go , before someone sees us .
lola . may i have a word ?
of course this is happening . what is it , mother ?
do you mind telling me what you &apos;re doing here ?
oh , yeah , well , let &apos;s see .
um , this morning , while i was in the shower at nate &apos;s ,
serena , the cousin i just found out about ,
tricked me into coming to the wake of the grandmother
that i never knew existed at the house of the family
that you hid from me for my entire life .
does that sum it up for you enough ?
i know you blame me for everything ,
but i only lied to you because
we &apos;re not safe around these people .
they &apos;re materialistic monsters .
oh , says the woman who looted her own daughter &apos;s trust fund .
that money was for you .
you cannot believe a word these people say .
mom , the only person here who &apos;s ever lied to me is you .
hey . i know this place is crazy , but i &apos;m really glad you came .
i was just about to call you .
i know . i screwed up .
yes , you did . who knows if anyone
will send in another tip ever ?
luckily for you , i &apos;m in the eye of the hurricane .
so i can watch your mess play out ,
and if this is my last day as gossip girl
thanks to you ,
i &apos;m going out with a bang .
dan , i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
hey , dennis .
georgina , i would ask you
what you &apos;re doing here
if i cared , which i don &apos;t , so ...
i was just wondering if you had the chance
to check &quot; gossip girl &quot; recently .
no . why ?
i know i promised i &apos;d never publicly reveal
that little video secret of yours ,
but unfortunately , i left philip in charge .
so ... lesson learned . okay . bye .
oh , &quot; g.g.--it &apos;s time you told everyone
dan humphrey sent in that video on blair &apos;s wedding day . &quot;
philip is rich , not bright .
i &apos;m sorry , but keep reading .
oh , my god . this was-- this was sent in by ...
how dare you ?
of all your many , many attempts at sabotage ,
this is by far the most pathetic .
are you so worried that i &apos;ll find happiness without you
that you feel the need to spread baseless lies
at the wake of my best friend &apos;s grandmother ?
while you may be correct about my motives ,
the blast is anything but a lie .
you know serena and i didn &apos;t send the video ,
and it certainly wasn &apos;t louis , so who &apos;s left ?
i &apos;m not playing this game .
why don &apos;t you tell that to your boyfriend over there ?
or even better , ask him the truth .
blair , please wait .
i have nothing to say to you .
i am so sorry i lied .
you didn &apos;t just lie , humphrey .
you let me blame my best friend and my ex
for something they didn &apos;t do .
you embarrassed me
in front of 400 guests at my own wedding .
you made me the target of tabloids and t.s.a. agents .
not to mention , you helped lock the bars of my gilded cage .
am i forgetting anything ?
i should have told you the truth right away ,
but i swear , i never meant to hurt you .
then what other reason could you have had to send in that video ?
i spent every day leading up to the wedding
listening to you say you had to marry louis
even though you didn &apos;t love him .
i couldn &apos;t stand to see you so unhappy .
i only thought it would stop the wedding .
i never thought you would leave it with me .
and us fighting like this is exactly what
that bass @-@ face wanted .
but since cyrus thinks everything will work out
with the annulment ...
what can i do ? is there anything ?
just say the word , and i will--
just shut up , humphrey .
i forgive you ... for now .
estee ?
did you follow me ? i thought we weren &apos;t meeting till 4 : 00 .
yes , after cyrus tried to trick the royal attorney
into voiding your prenup .
i know everything .
uh ... follow me .
looks like blair &apos;s annulment just got annulled .
shame . you were so close , too .
let me assure you ,
your stepfather &apos;s plan will never work .
you slimy little limey .
i do not respond well to threats ,
and neither does cyrus rose .
he fought in &apos; nam .
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
his plan might not work , but mine can .
we can help each other , you and i.
go on .
you don &apos;t want louis . that &apos;s clear . but i do .
the prince and i ... we &apos;re very close .
we grew up together , but my station
always prevented me from being a suitable choice
for her serene highness , at least--
until i came along .
precisely .
you &apos;re a public relations disaster .
出身普通家庭 婚后曾被拍到与富商的不雅照
next to your sarah ferguson &apos;s swan dive ,
i &apos;m kate bloody middleton .
so you think the grimaldis will welcome
louis &apos; loyal @-@ and @-@ loving social secretary
as a replacement ?
i know louis would .
sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s fine . oddly enough , i just want him to be happy .
then this is worth a shot , isn &apos;t it ?
you have nothing to lose .
make the call .
so that &apos;s the tour . thank you for coming by ,
or at least letting me trick you into coming by .
i assure you , nate had no idea .
well , actually , he said we were going to a museum ,
so he wasn &apos;t that far off .
look , i know what your mom thinks about us ,
you know , how all we care about is money--
and the things you can buy .
but that couldn &apos;t be further from the truth .
family is what &apos;s most important to us ,
and to prove that to you , i have two people
who are gonna be so excited to see you .
and don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t notice
her georg jensen service here , either .
tell laryssa to count the silver right away .
i really appreciate everything you &apos;re trying to do ,
but , um ... i &apos;m just not part of this world .
and i don &apos;t really think i wanna be , either ,
so just tell nate i had to go .
oh , lola .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you here .
why ?
even if i don &apos;t wanna be here ,
i have more of a reason than you do .
look , i know this sounds ridiculous ,
but the van der woodsens are the closest thing i have
to an actual family .
even though they hate me .
yeah , i have the opposite problem .
maybe my mother really was trying to protect me .
by stealing all your money ?
ladies ...
on the upper east side , money is never the real story .
it &apos;s usually just the &quot; x &quot; that marks the spot
for what &apos;s buried beneath it .
if i were you two , i &apos;d start digging .
what do you mean ?
i know it &apos;s hard for you , but stop and think .
money doesn &apos;t explain
why you hide your daughter for 18 years ,
unless she was being paid to do so ,
and judging by her hair and her clothes ,
i &apos;d say that isn &apos;t so .
you think there &apos;s something else going on ?
how do i find out ?
well , nobody here is going to tell you .
you have to find someone from the outside ,
somebody who isn &apos;t afraid of them .
somebody like ...
dad .
looks like there &apos;s a doctor in the house
who &apos;s about to get a taste of his own medicine .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
it would have meant so much to grandma .
i wouldn &apos;t miss this for the world .
i &apos;m just sorry that eric couldn &apos;t make it back from zaire .
i think they call that the democratic republic of congo now .
they do , but trust me , it &apos;s not .
charlie , good to see you again .
oh , you &apos;re a little late to the party , doctor .
that isn &apos;t your niece , but this is .
sorry ?
what are you even doing here ?
come on . let &apos;s go say hi to mom .
daddy v @-@ d @-@ dubs has known the rhodes sisters since high school .
i bet he has a secret or two he &apos;d be willing to share
if you ask nicely .
hey , serena said you left , but here you are with ivy .
hi , nate .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here , but we should probably leave
since lola and i were just walking out--
no , i &apos;m gonna stay , and so is she .
we &apos;re gonna get to the bottom of why my mom
really kept me away all these years , so , um ,
if you don &apos;t mind ...
oui .
naturellement .
well ?
he agreed . i need to be on the next plane back .
i &apos;m to be amongst the royal court tomorrow
when the prince breaks the news in a press conference
about how it became clear you were only ever after his title .
but , uh--
okay . okay . what else ?
then the royal family &apos;s publicist
will start to build me up ,
the woman who has watched from the wings for decades .
okay , enough about you . more about me .
her serene highness and the prince
are only willing to annul the marriage
if you agree to a gag order on all matters
regarding the dissolution .
they can be the only ones to speak about it publicly .
do you understand what that means ?
well , i &apos;ll do whatever they say ,
as long as it gets me out of this marriage .
a press blackout is a small price to pay
to get my life back .
that includes no more blind items
on &quot; page six &quot; or posts on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
princess sophie was very clear
if you don &apos;t adhere to the deal ,
they &apos;ll make you pay .
do whatever you want in your private life .
just keep it private .
good luck .
i &apos;m glad we can both get what we want .
and please assure the royals when you see them
that they won &apos;t hear a peep from me .
beer me .
perhaps you &apos;d prefer something a little stronger .
it &apos;s green .
what are you so relaxed about ?
we both know that gossip girl &apos;s latest hiccup
makes you look even worse in blair &apos;s eyes .
maybe today , but at least she knows
dan isn &apos;t the good guy he pretends to be .
in time , that &apos;ll sink in .
she &apos;s not getting out of
this royal mess anytime soon .
oh , but she just did .
that royal minder lady brokered the deal herself .
although the hint of a new scandal
could probably derail it if you act fast enough .
blair will come to her senses .
what if she doesn &apos;t ?
what if you spend the rest of your days
wondering why you didn &apos;t try and stop her
from falling into the flannelled arms
of that pretentious poseur ?
anywho , something to think about .
what do you have in mind ?
remember when i showed you this ?
how can i trust
gossip girl wouldn &apos;t
leave my fingerprints on another blast ?
you can &apos;t , which is why
we use her latest screwup
to our advantage and leave somebody else &apos;s instead .
oh , look . dan &apos;s phone .
it must have fallen out of
his coat and into my purse .
i &apos;m sorry , carol , but i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
to let me search your bag .
laryssa saw you pocket--
lily , this is beneath even you .
i see some things never change--
the maid accusing my ex sister @-@ in @-@ law of stealing .
william , what a lovely surprise .
hello , dear .
doesn &apos;t dad look great ?
and how are you , carol ?
under surveillance .
lily has been shadowing me all afternoon .
that &apos;s because i knew you &apos;d try to steal something ,
and apparently you did .
do you see what i have to deal with ,
while my own mother lies right here ?
all right , carol , i &apos;ve had enough .
i want you out of my apartment this minute .
technically , it &apos;s cece &apos;s apartment .
what are you talking about ?
this is our home .
only because your mother bought it for us .
remember ? for tax purposes , of course .
but now it &apos;s part of the estate .
william , thank you again for coming .
and i would appreciate it if you would leave the settling
of mother &apos;s affairs to the executor of her estate .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m doing .
i am her executor .
and i brought her will .
ladies , i know this must come as a shock ,
but as you well know , your mother and i
had a long and enduring friendship .
it &apos;s just , of all the people for cece to pick ,
i find it curious that she chooses
the father of lily &apos;s children .
well , she couldn &apos;t very well have asked
the father of yours .
there aren &apos;t enough d.n.a.
tests in dade c = ounty to find him .
i think i &apos;ll let you two blow off some steam .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
hi again . i &apos;m lola , carol &apos;s daughter .
the real one .
what can i do for you ?
well , i just recently found out
that i &apos;m a part of this family ,
and i was wondering why i was never allowed to know .
so i thought , you know , you &apos;ve known my mom longer
than anyone aside from lily--
excuse me .
mom , do you mind ?
yes , actually , i do .
you &apos;ll let me know when you need me ,
won &apos;t you , william ?
miss blair , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but , ms. estee jedi @-@ mind @-@ tricked me
into telling her you at wake .
too many secrets lately .
i @-@ i feel like
&quot; tinker tailor soldier spy . &quot;
oh , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m glad estee found me .
everything &apos;s gonna work out perfectly now .
that &apos;s not what mr. cyrus say .
he &apos;s been trying to call you for last hour .
why you no answer phone ?
i put it on silent . i &apos;m at a wake .
and you can tell cyrus he doesn &apos;t need to worry .
i took care of the annulment myself .
then why grimaldis just call him and ask for all the money now ?
well , they agreed to waive the dowry
as long as i completely stayed out of the press .
maybe princess sophie read &quot; gossip girl &quot; again , then .
&quot; please post a.s.a.p. dan . &quot;
&quot; i , celia catherine rhodes ,
of montecito , california ,
being of sound mind and body ,
do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament .
first , i leave my two andalusian thoroughbreds ,
rickey and reggie rhodes , to the valley ranch stables .
second , i leave my faberge egg collection-- &quot;
hey , dad , wait a second .
sorry . i just--i don &apos;t want her here for this .
is she bothering you ?
she &apos;s a con artist , william .
and not a very good one .
nevertheless , your mother invited her to be here ,
so ... i would like everybody to respect cece &apos;s wishes , ok ?
please .
now if there are no more interruptions ...
i think you dropped something .
what ...
are you insane ? blair &apos;s gonna think
i actually sent this picture in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
that was the point .
we had a deal , georgina . you promised to protect me
if i didn &apos;t tell anyone you were gossip girl .
i sold you out , so start talking .
look , i had fun being gossip girl ,
but i &apos;m kind of over it .
i &apos;m just glad that the final blast was my masterpiece .
i &apos;m sorry if it ruins your life .
it &apos;s not just mine . it &apos;s blair &apos;s , the waldorfs &apos; .
oh . i know . what a mess .
it &apos;s like i just took down the entire upper east side .
oh . here comes the bull &apos;s @-@ eye .
you brooklyn benedict arnold , i can &apos;t believe you .
被华盛顿判处死刑
it was georgina .
she &apos;s gossip girl .
oh , you will really say anything , won &apos;t you ?
oh , no , that part &apos;s true .
well , half ture . i hacked into g.g. &apos; s website
a few months ago when she obviously skipped town
and none of you noticed , and honestly , guys ,
the experience has been wonderful ,
but it &apos;s just as well it &apos;s over now .
okay , could you--could you tell her the important part ?
i didn &apos;t do this .
how does it feel to be set up and lose the person you love
for something you didn &apos;t do ?
estee ! please .
there must be a way to still salvage our deal
with the grimaldis .
there might be ... if there ever was a deal .
i &apos;m sorry ?
oh ? the deal thing ? estee made it all up
with my help , of course .
we knew once chuck heard you were free again ,
he &apos;d do something foolish .
of course , even i didn &apos;t think it would happen this fast .
anyway , i must get back to monaco .
i have a prince to console . cheers .
standing ovation ? why , thank you .
oh , my god .
i was just bitch @-@ slapped by bridget jones .
you don &apos;t realize what you &apos;ve done .
yes , i do . i &apos;ve brought to light the real villain ,
and let me give you a hint . it &apos;s not me .
you bankrupted the waldorf family .
that &apos;s what paying this dowry is gonna do to them .
it was that much ?
no . you left me no choice .
it would be one thing losing blair
because she doesn &apos;t wanna be with me ,
but i only lost her because of something you did .
were you ever really my friend ,
or was it all just an act
so you could keep me in check until you got what you wanted ?
chuck , that is not how any of it happened , and you know it .
you framed me ,
and in my book , that makes you the bad guy , not me .
what &apos;s going on ?
ever since the accident ,
dan has been trying to keep us apart
so you can have you all to himself .
be honest for once in your life .
tell her the truth . she deserves that .
he &apos;s absolutely right .
i &apos;m sorry .
11--i leave my collection of early british watercolors
to my youngest daughter , lily . &quot;
i &apos;m sensing a pattern here .
oh , frankly , carol , i &apos;m surprised it took you
this long to realize what mother really thought of you .
oh , come on , mom . we &apos;re almost done here .
no , she knew that she was a greedy , spoiled--
excuse me , lily .
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s been married five times .
ladies ...
most of which was for money .
excuse me--
well , at least i didn &apos;t try
and embezzle my own daughter &apos;s trust fund
so i could go shopping at lululemon .
okay . the truth is , the only reason
mother left you those trinkets ...
as for the rest of my estate ,
all remaining property , artwork , antiques ..
stocks and bonds , bullion ...
is because you pretended
to love her and she pretended to love you .
at least we had an honest relationship .
contents of my safety deposit boxes and assorted holdings ...
william , i can &apos;t hear a thing .
i leave ... to you .
y @-@ you mean charlotte rhodes , my daughter .
this is not the real charlie rhodes . lola is .
no , i &apos;m afraid not , carol . it says--
it says so right here .
ivy dickens .
you are never gonna get away with this .
let &apos;s call the police .
oh , please .
wait . look , i never asked cece for anything .
oh , no , instead you poisoned her against her entire family
and manipulated her into giving you everything .
that &apos;s not true .
your grandmother just wanted someone to talk to .
oh , please . you don &apos;t think we can see through all your lies ?
you were a terrible actress when we first met ,
and you still are .
mom--
i swear on my life
all i ever did was help take care of her .
i mean , i even tried to tell you that she was sick .
oh , but conveniently failed .
look , will you please shut up ?
forget about the money .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
you each still have your trusts .
mine was liquidated years ago .
how do we know ivy didn &apos;t try to hasten our mother &apos;s death ?
are you people crazy ? look , i loved her .
that &apos;s my cue . i think i &apos;ve heard enough .
this ...
you can think whatever you want about me .
but i never lied to cece .
prove it .
well , didn &apos;t you hear the will ?
she didn &apos;t call me &quot; charlie rhodes . &quot;
she called me &quot; ivy dickens . &quot;
your mother knew all of my secrets ,
and she knew all of yours , too .
maybe that &apos;s why she left me everything .
ever since the accident , i &apos;ve been blaming myself ,
blaming louis , but it was humphrey behind it all .
it &apos;s not that simple .
yes , it is ,
and now that we know the truth ,
there is nothing in our way .
humphrey &apos;s not the reason we &apos;re not together ,
and neither is the dowry .
is this about saving my life again ?
because we &apos;re past that . you said you wanted to wait
until your marriage was over . now it &apos;s over .
chuck , i don &apos;t blame you .
and as crazy as this all has gotten ,
i know why you did everything .
because i love you .
and i love you .
i always will .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m in love with you .
at least not right now ,
not the way you need me to be ,
not the way you deserve .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have to go .
look , i know how that must have seemed up there ,
but ivy dickens is a thief .
she already stole your identity
and your money , and now she &apos;s about to rob the rest of us .
your family needs you right now .
you &apos;re not my family ,
and honestly , after listening to everybody upstairs ,
the only person i feel sorry for is ivy .
she &apos;s a criminal .
because your family made her into one .
serena , all you people do is lie to each other
and fight about money , so what &apos;s the difference , really ?
you know , it was my own fault for sticking around today .
i was dumb enough to think
that there might be some answers here for me .
at least now i know i was wrong .
care to join me , for old times &apos; sake ?
oh , cut the crap , william .
you need to fix this .
cece &apos;s wish are cece &apos;s wishes .
i don &apos;t care what she wanted .
today was supposed to be my payday , and you know that .
i understand you &apos;re upset .
no , you don &apos;t understand a thing .
if you can &apos;t find a way to make this right ,
i &apos;m gonna be forced to resort to other ways to get my money .
like getting a real job ?
i &apos;ve always hesitated going after lola &apos;s father
for child support he owes me , oh , almost 20 years .
good luck with that .
do you even know who he is ?
i &apos;m looking right at him .
sorry i never told you ,
but not as sorry as you &apos;re gonna be
when lily finds out what we were doing while you were married ,
unless , of course , you have another idea ?
this just is my lucky day .
spotted--dr . van der woodsen white as a sheet .
looks like the rules of this rhodes
just changed before his very eyes .
how &apos;d you get past the doorman ?
wait . i don &apos;t even wanna know .
look , i know no one believes a word i say ,
but i really didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
you were just collateral damage .
well , if it had been anyone else but me ,
i might believe you , but we both know
you &apos;ve always wanted to settle the score between us .
you have to understand .
when i decided to stop being gossip girl ,
i knew that anyone who knew or found out
would have it out for me .
so i realized i &apos;d better start collecting favors
to use as protection down the line .
running that picture of you kissing dan
was my golden ticket to use with chuck down the road .
i &apos;d love one from you , too .
are you using again ?
why would i ever make myself indebted to you ?
because i have a way that your family
doesn &apos;t have to pay the grimaldis a thing ,
and you get your divorce in the process .
even you can &apos;t pull that rabbit out of your hat .
i was gossip girl for two months .
you have no idea the dirt i have on people .
i &apos;ve been so good for so long ,
it &apos;s time for me to be bad .
i can help you .
let me solve all your problems .
fine .
anything to be done with this .
do what you can , and if you succeed ,
then i &apos;ll enjoy whatever horror you concoct .
believe me , i won &apos;t let you down ,
and you won &apos;t let me down , either , when i come back .
charles .
lily , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
oh . tough day , as they say .
for you , too ?
oh , no , i wouldn &apos;t dream of adding to your burden .
oh , come on . you never have .
it would be a good distraction .
what &apos;s wrong ?
blair . she walked away from me today ,
and not like she has done in the past .
it was different .
i feel like she &apos;s changing .
i know i didn &apos;t die in the car accident ,
but sometimes it feels like i did .
don &apos;t say that . you survived , and it was a miracle .
thanks to saint waldorf .
you mean thanks to saint jack .
the doctors didn &apos;t tell you ?
oh , it &apos;s all such a blur now . um ...
when you were in surgery , there was a complication ,
and they needed a family member for a blood transfusion ,
and i gave the doctors jack &apos;s number .
jack ?
yes .
you haven &apos;t lived until you &apos;ve tried
caramel mousse and chocolate .
are you just gonna ply me
with sweets until i cheer up ?
because i think i &apos;ll probably go into sugar shock
before that happens .
i am so sorry . i mean , truly .
no , don &apos;t be . you &apos;re about the only good thing
in my life right now .
sorry . hello ?
lola . it &apos;s william van der woodsen .
sorry to bother you .
i just felt badly we weren &apos;t able to finish our conversation ,
so i asked serena for your phone number .
oh , no . you know , today was a lot for everybody ,
ao ... no apology necessary .
well , i &apos;m at the empire if you need to reach me , okay ?
okay . great . yeah . i &apos;ll call you then , i guess .
bye .
so after all that ,
you &apos;re really just giving up &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
well , with chuck and blair beholden to me ,
i &apos;m more powerful than ever .
it &apos;s time to pass the &quot; gossip girl &quot; baton .
let someone else see if they can outshine me ,
or at the very least , die trying .
now be a doll and send this for me .
my flight to monaco is in two hours ,
and be very careful with this .
there &apos;s stuff on this laptop that &apos;ll blow people &apos;s minds .
bring back pictures .
don &apos;t you worry .
bye .
finally , some peace and quiet .
i &apos;m sorry .
am i interrupting something ?
yes , you are . it &apos;s been a long day for everyone .
i think it &apos;d be best if you left .
i was just gonna say the same thing ...
but to the two of you .
what are you talking about ?
this is my apartment now .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
you think we &apos;re just gonna let you leave here ?
this all just needs to get sorted out .
naturally .
but you &apos;ll have to do it from someplace else .
oh , and where are we supposed to go ?
it &apos;s not like we have another apartment in the city . it &apos;s--
yes , we do , lil .
come on .
i &apos;ll just get my things .
oh , miss . serena . i tidy up later .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it was beautiful wake for ms. cece .
good @-@ byes never easy .
yeah , i know , but that &apos;s all i seem to say these days--
to my grandma , to jobs , to boys , to everything .
i &apos;m just sick of good @-@ byes .
something new arrive soon .
it always does .
i hope so .
i &apos;m ready for it , whatever it is .
attention , upper east siders .
after everything that happened today ,
i &apos;ve decided i need a little break
to catch my breath .
i &apos;m sure you do , too .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be back .
i always am .
well , if you came here
to tell me what a horrible person i am ,
then you &apos;re too late . i already know .
that &apos;s not why i came .
you got back together with chuck ?
no .
are you ... moving to a desert island
where there are no men at all ,
and you &apos;ll be living the rest of your life
in peaceful solitude ?
no .
i told chuck he doesn &apos;t have my heart anymore .
i realized it belongs to someone else .
uh , so , dan , are you gonna invite me in or what ?
what ?
you just said my name .
dan ?
yeah . you just said it again .
dan .
say it again .
dan .
dan .
and when i return , i bet it &apos;ll be a whole new world .
