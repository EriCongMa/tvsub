第七季 第十二集
this is nice , that we all get to eat together .
absolutely .
can we maybe put the phones down
and have an actual human conversation ?
we can ,
but thanks to steve jobs ,
we don &apos;t have to .
guys , guys ,
you &apos;re never gonna believe this .
what happened ?
i just got a part on a tv show !
congratulations !
what ? that &apos;s great !
guys !
oh , yeah !
yay , penny !
what &apos;s the show ?
um , nc ... ii ...
or , you know , ncstd ... i don &apos;t know ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the one with the letters and i &apos;m gonna be on it !
that &apos;s amazing .
yeah .
what &apos;s your part ?
um , i play a customer in a diner
and i flirt with mark harmon .
ooh , mark harmon ,
he &apos;s a dreamboat .
so i @-@ it &apos;s just flirting ?
well , yeah . why ?
uh , no reason .
i just think it &apos;s sexier when things are
left to the imagination .
he &apos;s wrong .
so i @-@ i read a study that says a man with a dog
is three times more likely to get a woman &apos;s phone number .
is it true even when the man lets his dog
lick peanut butter off his tongue ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
if you &apos;re really desperate to meet women
and like having food eaten out of your mouth ,
i could set you up with my mom .
why is that funny ?
that &apos;s just unhygienic .
it &apos;s a joke .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe that a joke
is a brief oral narrative
with a climactic humorous twist .
for example , uh , wolowitz &apos;s mother is so fat
that she decided to go on a diet ...
or exercise , or both .
see ?
the twist is that people don &apos;t usually change .
well , they don &apos;t .
hey , guys , don &apos;t forget ,
my episode &apos;s on tv tomorrow night .
we &apos;ll be there .
can we bring anything ?
oh , that &apos;s so sweet of you ,
but i was gonna steal food from here .
you know ... my treat .
wait , if howard &apos;s mother is coming ,
then you should also steal marbles .
because she &apos;s obese ,
and hippos are obese ,
and in the popular board game &quot; hungry hungry hippos , &quot;
they eat marbles .
maybe i need to dumb these down for you .
leonard , do you think i &apos;m funny ?
no .
do you ?
i think i &apos;m hysterical .
i take it back .
that was funny .
the philosopher henri bergson says
it &apos;s funny when a human being behaves like an object .
i bet that bit killed at the chuckle hut .
oh , he didn &apos;t perform stand @-@ up comedy ,
he was a philosopher .
you know , i think we &apos;re zeroing in on your problem .
perhaps i &apos;ll spend some time
developing a unified theory of comedy ,
which will allow me to elicit laughter
from anyone at any time .
unless they &apos;re german ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s a tough crowd .
are you set on people laughing with you ?
&apos;cause if you &apos;re cool with at you ...
i don &apos;t get it .
raj , when you said you were gonna bring a date
to watch penny &apos;s thing tonight ,
i didn &apos;t think you meant stuart .
really ?
i never for a second
thought it &apos;d be anything else .
i almost met someone last night , but i blew it .
i was walking cinnamon
and this girl introduced herself ,
but she was so cute i panicked
and said , &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be easier
if instead of talking we could just sniff each other &apos;s butts ? &quot;
well , stuart &apos;s cute in his own way .
when i was a baby ,
my mother called me her little possum .
are possums cute ?
not at all .
if you &apos;re so intimidated
by talking to attractive girls ,
maybe you should practice by talking to regular people .
you mean like fatties and uggos ?
or maybe just stop talking .
i &apos;m serious .
go to the mall , talk to anybody , practice--
that way , when you eventually do talk to a cute girl ,
it won &apos;t be so scary .
or just keep dating the possum .
parsa doesn &apos;t have those kind of resources .
no , and that &apos;s why he had erin pace rewire it ...
i &apos;m so proud of you .
we haven &apos;t even gotten to my scene yet .
i know ,
but you &apos;re going to be a tv star
and you haven &apos;t left me yet . that takes guts .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;m very uncomfortable with all this .
why ?
i &apos;ve never seen this show before
and now i &apos;m starting with episode 246 ?
it &apos;s unnatural .
just think of the first 245 as the prequel .
all right .
okay , shh . guys , guys , this is it .
i guess it &apos;s you and me , kid .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to make peace .
we &apos;re good .
good .
really ? because ...
are you kidding me ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
well ... the diner scene .
where &apos;s my diner scene ?
well , don &apos;t ask me .
until i see the prequel , i &apos;m lost .
no , there was supposed to be a big scene with me and mark harmon ,
but i @-@ it &apos;s ... gone .
what happened ?
they must &apos;ve cut it .
oh , penny ...
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
that stinks .
i &apos;m sure you were great .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i mean , i ...
i thought i did a ... a really good job , i ...
excuse me .
i &apos;ve been studying how to make people laugh .
they say that comedy
is tragedy plus time .
let &apos;s tickle some ribs .
no , dad ,
i don &apos;t think they cut me out of the show
because i was too pretty .
no , i don &apos;t need you to come out
and kick mark harmon &apos;s ass .
daddy , i gotta go .
i love you . bye .
how you doing ?
ugh , this is such a disaster .
my parents had all my relatives over .
they got one of those six @-@ foot sandwiches ,
and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and ...
... now he &apos;s missing
and the sandwich is missing , and ...
they &apos;re probably in mexico by now .
so humiliating .
you still got the part .
that &apos;s a huge accomplishment .
yeah , but this was supposed to be my break , okay ?
people were gonna see me in this show
and it was gonna lead to bigger things .
more auditions , more parts ...
now none of that &apos;s gonna happen .
honey , you only had , like , three lines .
that wasn &apos;t gonna happen anyway .
unbelievable .
come on ...
no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
then what did you mean ?
i don &apos;t ...
look , you know , words don &apos;t always have to mean things .
i think you meant that you don &apos;t believe in me .
nope .
i might not know what i @-@ i meant ,
but i know that i didn &apos;t mean that .
not this guy . oh , no way .
i want you , right now ,
to give me your 100 % honest opinion .
right .
do you think i have what it takes
to really make it as an actress ?
yes .
so you think i &apos;ll be on tv
and in movies and win awards .
honestly ?
yes , honestly .
i don &apos;t .
how could you say that ?
i don &apos;t know ...
i got all confused when you said &quot; honestly . &quot;
look , do i think that you are talented
and that you are beautiful ?
of course i do .
but isn &apos;t los angeles full of actresses
who are just as talented , just as beautiful ?
all right , look ... we &apos;ll come back to that .
no , please . don &apos;t stop , go on .
tell me how i &apos;m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life .
that is not what i said .
look , i think you &apos;re really good .
i truly do .
but this is an incredibly hard thing that you &apos;re shooting for .
i mean , the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor
are like a million to one .
wow , thank you .
should &apos;ve let sheldon come .
this is interesting .
apparently , a key component in some forms of humor
is the element of surprise .
well , that makes sense .
the prefrontal cortex is responsible for
planning and anticipation ,
and patients with brain lesions on their ...
brain lesions !
sheldon , you scared me .
that wasn &apos;t funny .
or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex .
okay , the notion that you can read a few books
and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd .
i mean , humor is
a complex neurological ...
okay , that &apos;s pretty good .
excellent .
how about her ?
no !
no pretty girls !
the point is to talk to regular people
and work our way up to pretty girls .
fine .
how about that old lady with the walker ?
that depends .
on any level , do you think she &apos;s hot ?
we &apos;ll find somebody else .
kumquat ?
i guess .
ointment ?
sure .
now , would you say ointment
is more , equal to , or less funny than kumquat ?
i don &apos;t think i want to go out with you anymore .
will you please stop joking around ?
i &apos;m trying to figure this out .
sheldon , how many words are you gonna go through ?
all of them .
you didn &apos;t get your part cut .
all right , baby , here &apos;s the deal .
and you didn &apos;t get your part cut .
yep , bunch of old guys rocking out in a band ,
all with erectile dysfunction ,
you didn &apos;t get your part cut !
can we talk ?
we can , but the part of penny might get cut .
that was really crappy of me .
what you &apos;re trying to do is hard ,
but people do make it ,
and i really do believe you could be one of them .
thank you .
and ...
to show you how much i believe in you ,
i kind of got you an audition .
are you serious ? for what ?
the new star wars movie .
what ? !
how did you manage that ? !
there &apos;s this thing online , you put yourself on tape
and just send it in-- anyone can do it .
come on leonard , this is just a pr stunt .
so ? even if it is , you have a huge advantage
because you &apos;re an actual actress .
most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds .
wolowitz sent his in two days ago .
really , let it go .
look , maybe it is a long shot ,
but sometimes long shots happen .
luke skywalker was only given one chance
to destroy the death star .
he had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port
that was only two meters wide ,
but with the help of the force , he ...
wow , i can feel you hating me right now .
how about that lady in the sweat suit , speed @-@ walking ?
yeah , she seems friendly and easy to ...
never mind , she &apos;s gone .
yeah , maybe talking to people is too hard .
we could go over to that department store ,
practice on the mannequins .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re dressed very stylishly .
they &apos;re probably stuck @-@ up .
this is ridiculous .
the next person that walks by ,
no matter who it is , they &apos;re the one .
we &apos;re gonna die here .
hello .
hey .
where &apos;s sheldon ?
he &apos;s home trying to use science
to determine the basis of humor .
that &apos;s interesting .
it &apos;s exhausting .
do you have any idea how hard it is
to laugh at a knock @-@ knock joke that starts with ,
&quot; knock @-@ knock @-@ knock , amy ,
knock @-@ knock @-@ knock , amy , knock @-@ knock @-@ knock , amy &quot; ?
if you want him to stop ,
sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh .
fake a laugh ?
do you ever do that with me ?
no , of course not .
well , i &apos;d be able to tell anyway .
i don &apos;t think you would .
please , i &apos;ve made plenty of girls laugh ,
sometimes just by asking them out .
yeah ? well , i fake my orgasms .
yes , how much for a hundred long @-@ stemmed red roses ?
really ?
how much for three ?
yeah , i &apos;ll call you back .
look , i know you were just trying to help
with your star wars thing .
i didn &apos;t mean to call it idiotic .
well , i don &apos;t think you called it idiotic .
sorry , i meant to .
anyway , um , i was just upset with myself .
i wasn &apos;t mad at you .
i just feel like everything is falling apart .
come on . it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay ! look at me , okay ? !
i took a temp job as a waitress forever ago ,
and i &apos;m still doing it .
i can &apos;t quit , because guess what ?
i can &apos;t do anything else .
and i finally get my big break ,
and it goes away !
i &apos;m such a mess .
no , you &apos;re not .
really ? !
&apos;cause this morning at starbucks ,
a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg !
and it wasn &apos;t the only one in there .
okay , listen to me , this is just a minor setback .
no , it &apos;s not , okay ? !
i &apos;ve been out here for , like , ten years !
i &apos;ve nothing to show for it !
well , you have me .
you &apos;re right .
i do have you .
let &apos;s get married .
what ?
leonard hofstadter ...
will you marry me ?
did you seriously just say , &quot; um &quot; ? !
look , you know i love you ,
but @-@ but you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re drunk and sad and feeling lost ...
okay , so @-@ so you don &apos;t want to marry me ? !
that is not what i said .
no , forget it ! i take it back ! offer &apos;s off the table !
who &apos;s in the mood to laugh ? !
really not a good time .
but i used science to construct the perfect joke .
i &apos;m gonna go .
penny , don &apos;t .
no , no , i just need to be alone .
so , a sandwich , a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar .
where are you going ?
to my room .
should i follow you ?
no .
leonard , wait .
what ?
i forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous .
how about those guys on that bench over there ?
they look pathetic .
i bet we could talk to them .
that &apos;s a mirror .
oh , yeah .
hey , fellas , mall &apos;s closing .
sorry .
yeah . good night .
uh , excuse me .
yeah ?
uh , do @-@ do you like being a mall security guard ?
it &apos;s all right .
okay , nice talking to you .
smooth ... !
can &apos;t sleep ?
no .
would you like to talk about it ?
penny proposed , and i didn &apos;t say yes .
why not ?
that &apos;s a good question .
does that mean the relationship is over ?
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you ask her ?
because i &apos;m afraid to know the answer .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re not gonna make some dumb joke
or some inappropriate comment ?
no .
you &apos;re my friend , and ...
i &apos;m sorry .
did you just put a &quot; kick me &quot; sign on my back ?
no .
that wouldn &apos;t be funny at all .
star wars audition , take one ...
starring howard joel wolowitz ,
real @-@ life astronaut .
vader is here ...
now ... on this moon .
i felt his presence .
he &apos;s come for me .
he can feel when i &apos;m near ...
how many times do i have to tell you
to replace the toilet paper when it &apos;s empty ? !
i &apos;m in the middle of something !
so am i !
