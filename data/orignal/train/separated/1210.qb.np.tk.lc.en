eddie lamb gave this to ezra .
it &apos;s a drawing of my mother .
he left it anonymously .
eddie wants ezra to know
that there &apos;s something to look into at radley .
thief .
thief .
the reason zack kept calling last night ,
he wanted to know your reaction .
he proposed ?
cheers .
hanna , right ?
it &apos;s sydney , emily &apos;s friend .
you on your way out ?
no , i just had dinner over at em &apos;s .
do you want to sit for a minute ?
i guess i probably could sober up a little bit .
you don &apos;t have to worry about shana , she &apos;s dead .
i killed her .
what did i miss ?
did you just get the text that came in ? it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; new york , new york , it &apos;s hell of a town .
ali &apos;s keeping secrets .
maybe that &apos;s because of hanna &apos;s big mouth . &quot;
* what child is this , *
* who laid to rest on mary &apos;s lap , is sleeping *
* whom angels greet with anthem sweet *
* while shepherds watch are keeping *
* this , this is ... *
so you hadn &apos;t spoken to shana
since before the abduction ?
i hadn &apos;t spoken to anyone during--
no , i get it .
not until you broke free .
i &apos;m just trying to understand why shana ,
who thought you were deceased ,
chose to move up to this area and live with her aunt .
i can &apos;t answer that .
well , neither can shana ,
who really is deceased .
so you will have to bear with me
while i wrap my brain around the coincidence .
did you ever try to contact shana ?
i thought this was going to be about my mother .
am i the only one who thinks that this freak
went after her because i got away from him ?
the police have many theories .
why would tanner do this in here ?
to make a point . we &apos;re next .
maybe the cops saw ali sneaking out of her house last night , too .
you didn &apos;t tell ali about spencer &apos;s tapes , did you ?
of course not .
some of us know how to keep our mouths shut .
hey , what was that about ?
shana . it was all about shana .
does tanner know we weren &apos;t in philly that night ?
i can &apos;t tell .
but she clearly doesn &apos;t believe my story .
she &apos;s trying to trip me up .
okay , well , i got to go call ezra .
no , aria , wait .
for what ?
so she can go ambush him
while he &apos;s having a medical check @-@ up in new york ?
he needs to know what was broadcast in the brew .
what &apos;s wrong ?
when did this happen ?
did you have your bag with you all morning ?
yeah .
what &apos;re you looking at ?
i don &apos;t get it .
somebody &apos;s circled all the &quot; a &apos;s . &quot;
what ? is there something else ?
&quot; glad to hear you singing .
last time you were all choked up . &quot;
it &apos;s not an outrageous theory .
mona may have recruited half the school to torture alison .
it &apos;s not just alison .
we &apos;re all hearing from &quot; a &quot; again .
we still have no idea who was in the brew
with hanna and sydney .
maybe sydney can tell us .
are you collecting that for recycling ?
hanna ,
what is going on with you ?
what are you talking about ?
yesterday your blouse was on inside out
and today your locker smells like oktoberfest .
what are you , the hall monitor ?
no , we &apos;re your friends .
and we &apos;re a little bit concerned .
you know what , this can isn &apos;t even mine .
caleb probably put it in my bag .
don &apos;t . i already have one friend throwing me shade .
have you apologized to her ?
aria doesn &apos;t want to hear it .
i left her a message .
yeah , we heard it .
and it sounded like you were underwater
and caleb was laughing in the background .
he was watching a guy eat his own beard on youtube .
classy . you may need to say it again .
yeah , and apologize to alison .
hanna , you almost outed her in front of my mom .
okay , we were there to support her story ,
not throw peanuts at the stage .
let &apos;s just finish this at lunch .
i have other plans .
ali got grilled by tanner .
&quot; a &quot; must have tipped her off about new york .
has eddie called yet ?
we need to figure out what &apos;s up with those drawings .
i &apos;ve got to get them back to big rhonda
before she notices they &apos;re missing .
ezra , just call me as soon as you can , okay ?
hey , what are you-- what are you doing here ?
i was just dropping off some invitations .
what are you doing outside ?
i just had to leave a message for dad .
i think i left a book in his car .
you were out the door so fast this morning .
i thought maybe we could have breakfast together .
yeah , i just figured
you guys were a little jet @-@ lagged .
so look , i know we &apos;ve asked you to say
a little something saturday night .
oh , mom , no .
i don &apos;t have to . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s your engagement party .
no , honey , no , i want you to . it &apos;s just--
i was wondering if i could introduce you
as my maid of honor .
oh , my god , of course !
yes , of course .
i &apos;m so glad you said that .
so i booked us an appointment today
this afternoon at the bridal shop . so--
wait . today ?
no-- no , i can &apos;t today . i &apos;m at radley .
well , can another volunteer cover your shift ?
cause it &apos;s just a little tricky to get these appointments ,
&apos;cause they book a suite and they do a tea service--
sounds like fun , mom ,
but i &apos;m gonna run ahead to class .
can we figure this out later ?
sure .
sydney .
hey , were you watching practice ?
no , i got hung up in language lab .
damn . i beat my freestyle record , thanks to you .
actually , i wanted to thank you ,
helping hanna sober up last night .
i mean , i heard she was totally out of it .
she didn &apos;t seem that bad .
really ?
she &apos;s like amish when it comes to booze .
two sips and she &apos;s blotto .
making stuff up , telling people
her grandfather invented the paper clip .
did he ?
hanna &apos;s ? no .
but she called me from home
and started rambling about us going back to new york .
i mean , we &apos;ve never even been to new york together .
did she invite you , too ?
i don &apos;t think she ever mentioned new york .
are you seriously not gonna tell me
the real reason you came in here ?
did they not make the offer ?
what offer ?
assistant coach . the team took a vote .
oh , my god .
either you &apos;re an amazing liar
or i am a total idiot .
please say you &apos;re thrilled .
um ... i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i have so much stuff going on ...
oh . okay .
sorry .
i thought you &apos;d want this , my bad .
hello ?
caleb ?
oh , hey , baby .
i thought we were meeting for lunch .
what time is it ?
uh , half past i &apos;m hungry .
uh , sorry , i must have overslept .
let me just throw some clothes on .
no , no worries . i &apos;ll just see you later .
hydrate .
thanks .
look , i &apos;m really sorry about the other night
at emily &apos;s dinner .
that was so not cool .
um , we &apos;re all stressed .
but if there &apos;s something else
and you &apos;re really upset with me ...
no , we &apos;re good .
so my dad &apos;s going to westport for a few days
and he wants me to go with him .
is &quot; a &quot; gonna let that happen ?
never .
but i obviously can &apos;t stay home alone , so .
can i crash at your house ?
um , i -- i &apos;d have to talk to my mom .
she has a lot going on right now .
but i &apos;ll talk to her .
it just gets more twisted .
if bethany was the one who pushed your mom off the roof
and mrs. dilaurentis covered for it ,
then i don &apos;t understand why she would
draw these pictures of mrs. dilaurentis getting
skewered by a demon .
and why would she turn on her ?
and did &quot; a &quot; play any part in it ?
because right now the only common denominator
between bethany and mrs. d is &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m sorry .
i know that you wanted to put radley behind you .
i can &apos;t put this behind me until it &apos;s over .
and it &apos;s not .
but it might be soon .
once i &apos;m asking questions from the inside .
from the inside of what ?
did both your parents move out ?
no , my mom &apos;s just not sitting down for meals .
she &apos;s barely even eating .
your parents are gonna work through this , spencer .
they &apos;ve got a lot of history together .
that &apos;s what &apos;s splitting them up .
what did you mean by the &quot; inside &quot; ?
the police department .
i enrolled at the harrisburg police academy .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you wouldn &apos;t do that .
why would you do that without telling me ?
probably because i anticipated this warm
and encouraging response .
toby , you can &apos;t just become a policeman .
why not ? i thought the uniform was a turn @-@ on .
no , it &apos;s not . is this why you cut your hair ?
well , you know , since the uniform didn &apos;t work .
people do not just up and join a police academy .
they do , when they &apos;re tired of watching people
they love feel unprotected .
oh , my god .
what -- look , the cops in this town
are either bungling or corrupt .
wouldn &apos;t it be refreshing to have someone inside
that building who actually cares ?
somebody who &apos;ll have access to all those police records ?
and somebody who doesn &apos;t think my house blew up
because of a gas leak ?
so now who &apos;s gonna cook this dinner
i was invited over for ?
you or me ?
can i help you ?
um , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m looking for eddie lamb .
he works here .
i was just helping out with art therapy .
i know why you &apos;re here . but eddie &apos;s not .
yesterday was his last day .
he didn &apos;t mention that .
did he get another job ?
i have no idea .
did he leave a forwarding number ?
anyway to contact him ?
are you here to finger @-@ paint or speed @-@ date the orderlies ?
i suggest you stick to the day room .
you looked for something ?
i--
i couldn &apos;t find you
and i just wanted to take another peek at your sketchbook
and then just put it right back .
one of the nurses ...
they said that you stashed it under your bed .
i &apos;m sorry , rhonda . really .
i -- i never meant to invade your space .
but i &apos;m gonna go back to the day room now .
they &apos;re probably looking for me .
i can forget i saw you here .
okay .
but it might cost you something .
like what ?
there were so many days i thought i wouldn &apos;t make it .
but then i thought of my family
and that &apos;s what got me through it .
picturing my house , my family .
hey , sweetie .
oh . hey , han .
alison is going to stay with us for a few days
until her dad gets back .
ali , why don &apos;t you go upstairs and try to get some rest , okay ?
hanna and i can finish making dinner .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
you should take a nice hot bath .
here , you can use these .
it &apos;ll help you relax .
thank you , mrs. marin .
you &apos;re welcome .
hanna , can you wash your hands and help ?
we &apos;re having stir fry .
that was so upsetting .
that girl has no support system at all .
you know i used to think ali was too tough for her own good .
but , thank god .
thank god she is .
otherwise i don &apos;t think she &apos;d have survived .
after dinner , could you please
make up the day bed with clean sheets ?
i &apos;m actually not gonna stay for dinner .
i promised caleb that i &apos;d help him study
for his exit exams .
okay , well , could you at least show alison
where the guest towels are ?
fine .
and by the way , i &apos;ve asked to use those bath salts ,
like a million times .
do you want a cup with that ?
maybe some crushed ice .
why you so into that sketchbook ?
was she a friend of yours ?
bethany ?
no , i-- i never met her .
but her body was buried in my friend &apos;s backyard .
so i think everyone &apos;s just a little curious about
who she was , why she ran away .
everybody thinks about running away from here .
a lot of folks had it a whole lot worse than she did .
how do you mean ?
i never had nobody signing me out ,
taking me to the circus .
wait . who signed bethany out ?
that rich lady with the big beige purse .
she gave bethany a whole lot more than a bag of chips .
wait . what rich lady ?
was her name mrs. dilaurentis ?
something like that .
what kind of gifts was she giving her ?
did she ever give her any clothes ?
a yellow top , maybe ? it was layered and--
i don &apos;t remember anything about a top .
but i sure as hell remember custard .
she gave her a pie ?
a horse .
she took her out to those stables by lewisburg
and let bethany adopt her own damn pony .
do you know why mrs. dilaurentis
would have been giving her all these gifts ?
rhonda , that rich lady was murdered recently .
and her body was found in the backyard next door
to where bethany &apos;s was buried .
and there &apos;s a really good chance
that the same exact person did this to both of them .
now do you have any idea at all who this person might be ?
what &apos;s going on in here ?
where did you get that ?
is this your idea of &quot; occupational therapy &quot; ?
giving a diabetic soda pop ?
get out of here . now .
i can &apos;t even stand to look at her
and now she &apos;s in my pajamas , drooling on my pillow .
please tell me you brought food in that bag .
i thought i was supplying beverages .
hey , do you want to go on a trip together ?
you mean , further than your cabin ?
yeah , someplace far .
you &apos;re not the only one who needs to change it up .
how do you feel about , um , japan ?
mm @-@ mm . i can &apos;t .
the only sushi i do is california rolls .
myanmar ?
okay , if i can &apos;t spell it or pronounce it ,
i can &apos;t go there .
hey , did you bring anything to cut this with ?
i was just gonna wait till we got back to my place .
do you want to stop and get sodas ?
i need a sandwich . i &apos;m starving .
you know , i &apos;ll be right back . do you want anything ?
hanna . can i help you ?
or are you just cooling off your face ?
i want a tuna melt .
sorry , i closed it up early tonight
to get ready for tomorrow .
aria &apos;s mom just left .
right .
do you want it to @-@ go ?
sydney ?
what &apos;s going on ?
your mom said i could interrupt .
this was delivered to my house and ...
well , i &apos;m not really sure what to do with it now .
you ordered this for me ?
guess i should have waited before i pulled the trigger .
you won &apos;t take no for an answer , will you ?
maybe &apos; cause our training sessions aren &apos;t happening anymore .
i just wanted to know you &apos;d still be in the bleachers .
it kind of sucks when you &apos;re the new kid on the team
and no one &apos;s cheering you on .
my boyfriend used to , but now he &apos;s in college .
what about your parents ?
my mom &apos;s not into it .
and my dad &apos;s always traveling .
he &apos;s opening these frozen yogurt shops .
they &apos;re all over the place .
you probably saw one when you were in new york .
they &apos;re called--
wait .
when was i in new york ?
didn &apos;t you say you and your friends were ...
no , that was hanna and you said that
she never mentioned--
my brain is mush , too much time underwater .
hey , you want mustard ?
yes , please .
looks really nice in here .
glad you approve .
&quot; quincinera . &quot;
&quot; quin @-@ ci @-@ nera . &quot;
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
i do .
just a heads up . i can smell you from here .
what &apos;s that ? rum ?
whiskey .
whiskey ? jeez .
the rough stuff .
bad girl , huh ?
always had a thing for the bad girls .
you know , this is the part where i &apos;m supposed
to lecture you about drinking ,
but i &apos;m willing to keep this between us .
i can keep a secret . can you ?
did aria make the flowers ?
yeah . they &apos;re great , right ?
all yours .
thank you .
oh , no , no , please .
it &apos;s on me .
thanks .
i &apos;ll never get back in that room .
did they fire you ?
no , i didn &apos;t kill her .
i just gave her a frigging root beer .
how was i supposed to know she needed sugar @-@ free ?
what &apos;s the name of the stables ?
i don &apos;t know , but we can figure that out .
how many stables are near lewisburg ?
aria , it &apos;s called &quot; horse country &quot; for a reason .
i got to go .
i completely forgot .
where were you ?
i went through a lot of trouble to change that appointment time
and then you just blew it off .
what is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i-- i just have a lot on my mind .
really ?
or is this some form of passive resistance ?
what ? i don &apos;t even know--
because if something has changed since i first told you ,
if you don &apos;t want me to get married again ,
i need you to be open about it , instead of acting out .
no , that &apos;s not it at all .
mom , i &apos;m really happy for you . i just--
i don &apos;t know , honestly , i just forgot .
okay , i will try and change the time .
but if you miss it--
i won &apos;t .
i promise .
i think you should take me home .
it &apos;s getting late and i don &apos;t want my mom to worry .
hanna , i can &apos;t drive right now .
i can call you a cab or something .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . it &apos;s just , my skirt .
it &apos;s too short .
no . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s perfect .
can you call them in like a half an hour ?
i have to go .
is everything okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m just drunk and i &apos;m tired .
and i want to go to sleep .
sure . i &apos;ll find out .
she wanted to know why hanna was absent .
what &apos;d you say ?
i said , i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s the truth .
maybe she &apos;s just trying to avoid aria .
avoiding is not returning a call .
chasing down your morning muffin with malt liquor ,
that &apos;s something else .
if she won &apos;t listen to us ,
someone needs to talk to caleb .
aria found out the name of the stables .
well , let &apos;s go after school .
what exactly are we looking for ?
we always thought that mrs. d
was protecting whoever hit ali out of love .
what if it was out of fear ?
what if this person had something on her ?
so now we &apos;re thinking that bethany hit ali ?
where have you been ?
i fell asleep in caleb &apos;s car .
where is everybody ?
did class start yet ?
no , it &apos;s over .
what &apos;s in your hair ?
it &apos;s a krispie treat . can you get it out please ?
hanna ,
why are you napping at 10 a.m. ?
because i couldn &apos;t sleep , okay ?
i have a new roommate named alison .
and there &apos;s other stuff , too .
ow ! emily don &apos;t pull so hard .
well , it &apos;s glued to your scalp .
what other stuff ?
hanna , what other stuff ?
if &quot; a &quot; is targeting you--
it &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
okay . i had a really weird moment with your boss last night .
my boss ?
zack ?
yeah .
i went to the brew to get a sandwich
and he just got a little bit too friendly . okay ?
what are you talking about ?
he put his hand on my back , emily ,
and it was there for way too long .
are you sure that you &apos;re not reading into this ?
no .
i mean , were you buzzed ?
you know what , forget i said anything .
hanna , wait .
no ! the only reason i told you
was because part of me wants to say something to aria .
but if you two don &apos;t believe me--
that &apos;s not what we said .
it &apos;s just that if you misinterpreted this at all ,
you don &apos;t want to be putting it out there
two days before this guy &apos;s engagement party .
and once it &apos;s said , you can &apos;t take it back .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
see you guys later .
hey , hanna .
no , i have to go to the bathroom .
hanna , are you in there ?
the school just called me .
alison ?
is everything okay ? where &apos;s hanna ?
caleb picked her up .
why aren &apos;t you at school ?
what happened ?
i heard someone last night ...
outside the window , trying to get in .
i couldn &apos;t go to sleep .
i just kept hearing things .
and when i got up to go to school this morning ...
i couldn &apos;t move .
alison ...
did you sleep in there last night ?
okay , i &apos;ll call the school .
you try to get some rest , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna take the day off .
are you declan ?
hi . the lady inside said you were the one
to talk to for lessons .
i don &apos;t work with beginners .
well , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ve had 8 years of english .
i teach western .
we ... we just heard that this place was really great .
our neighbor used to ride up here .
jessica dilaurentis ?
she might not have been up here for a while .
but there was this horse , custard ?
you here on some kind of dare ?
what ?
you look like the only horse
you &apos;ve ever been around was stuffed and in your crib .
if you &apos;re that spooked around zarro--
she &apos;s not spooked .
just shy .
okay .
come on , zarro . come on .
what are you ? mute ?
so hanna &apos;s having dinner with caleb again .
not really sure what &apos;s going on with her .
but i thought the two of us could go out
and grab a bite to eat .
i &apos;m okay staying here .
honey , you &apos;ve been inside all day .
i think we need to go out .
okay .
declan ?
sorry , we &apos;re still here . just curious .
do you ever let people adopt your horses ?
we &apos;ve done it a few times .
special cases .
that lady you &apos;re talking about ,
is she the one who came up here with that strange girl ?
the one who wanted to ride in her slippers ?
bethany ?
i don &apos;t remember names .
but after the bucket incident ,
i don &apos;t think they ever came back .
what--
what happened with the bucket ?
the lady wanted the girl to call her aunt jessie .
girl has a meltdown , throws a bucket at her .
i knew they weren &apos;t related .
there was something else going on .
was it always just the two of them
or was there ever a third person ?
maybe another blonde girl
who called mrs. dilaurentis &quot; mom &quot; ?
a lot of people come through here .
i don &apos;t take attendance .
you guys might want to head out
before that storm kicks in .
the roads up here , they turn into soup .
thanks .
why would you ask if alison had come up here ?
she told us she never met bethany .
yeah , she told us a lot of things .
where are you going with this ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just thought it would be worth it to float the question .
it &apos;s gonna start pouring . let &apos;s go .
no , i just need to take a look around here first .
spencer , where are you going ?
hey . sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
saw you out here , thought we could talk .
i was actually just about to leave .
what &apos;s your rush ? finish your meal .
i just wasn &apos;t sure what your takeaway was of yesterday .
yeah , sorry i was sort of off .
right .
i wasn &apos;t sure if you were feeling
the same vibe as me , but ...
i kind of think you are .
keep me up .
there &apos;s two of us .
yes , and can we just have a quieter table ,
maybe in the corner or something ?
all right . thank you . bye .
hanna ?
is that you , honey ?
hanna ?
alison ?
i &apos;ll be down in a minute .
you know , actually i &apos;m not that hungry .
give me your phone .
911 . what is your emergency ?
anything distinctive about it ? the shadow ?
mrs. marin ?
it was a man .
a man &apos;s shadow .
feel certain that &apos;s what it was , alison ?
yes .
why do you feel certain it was a man &apos;s shadow ?
because it was big .
loud .
loud ?
his weight made the floorboards creak .
i thought you weren &apos;t aware of the intruder
until you came downstairs .
by that time he would have been in the kitchen .
are there floorboards in the kitchen or is it tile ?
floorboards . why are you questioning her like this ?
this is just standard police procedure .
really ? to treat the victim like a criminal ?
i &apos;m just gathering as much detailed information as i can .
hasn &apos;t this girl been through enough ?
there &apos;s a predator out there and you have done nothing ,
nothing to make anyone feel any safer !
mrs. marin ...
i &apos;m not talking to you as a concerned citizen .
i &apos;m a mother ,
whose daughter is also affected by this situation .
you need to catch this psycho before--
before he strikes again .
do you need a towel ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
look , i know that me and you
aren &apos;t on the best terms right now ,
but i had to come over and i don &apos;t know
how else to say this , so i guess i &apos;ll just say it but--
zack hit on me .
what ?
at first i thought that he was joking ,
but then he got into my car and ...
wait .
what-- what are you saying ?
he wanted to hook up with me .
you kissed him ?
no .
no , i didn &apos;t .
but he was the one who ...
this is so messed up .
aria , i know . that &apos;s why i wanted to tell you .
no . you .
you are the problem , hanna .
you &apos;re always the problem .
what ?
the rest of us are getting ulcers
trying not to say the wrong thing ,
and you &apos;re getting hammered in front of emily &apos;s mom
and blabbing to a stranger .
i told you i was sorry .
no , you didn &apos;t tell me that . &quot; a &quot; did .
you couldn &apos;t even remember what you said .
we were just shouting out guesses
trying to jog your memory .
it &apos;s like playing charades with drunky .
sounds like murder .
that &apos;s not true .
what &apos;d you do , hanna ?
did you invite him into your car ?
why would i do that ?
were you trashed ?
no .
if you want to spiral out of control
and self @-@ destruct , by all means go right ahead .
but i sure as hell am not going to let you
take my mom down , too .
they &apos;re not gonna list every visitor that &apos;s ever come .
you don &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m looking for alison &apos;s handwriting .
did you find something ?
why was this hanging here ?
what do you mean ?
what &apos;s it doing ?
this is my sister &apos;s .
look at the initials .
m.h. oh , my god . how did you--
i recognized the riding crest .
it &apos;s where we used to take lessons .
what is it doing here ?
why is he so freaked out ?
it &apos;s the thunder .
let &apos;s go .
no , not yet .
spencer , for god &apos;s sake ,

toby .
i got your message .

what happened to your eye ?
something &apos;s just stuck in it
and i &apos;m trying to get it out .

it smells like ...
manure ?
yeah , what is that ?
it &apos;s manure .
emily and i went over to the stables
where mrs. dilaurentis used to take bethany .
did you find something ?
bethany apparently didn &apos;t like to be bribed .
and my sister &apos;s riding helmet was there .
wait , what ?
melissa &apos;s been up there , too ?
possibly , unless &quot; a &quot; knew that we were going out there
and then just planted it .
what happened to your eye , spence ?
we got locked in this stall
and the horse next to us just went psychotic
and we got really close to being kicked to death .
so did &quot; a &quot; take credit for this yet ?
toby .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m so tired of feeling like this .
feeling like what ?
powerless .
that &apos;s what i wanted to call and tell you .
what , that you &apos;re lucky you didn &apos;t get trampled ?
no . to tell you that i &apos;m sorry .
what are you talking about ?
if you becoming a cop is going to put an end to this ,
then i say , go .
study hard ,
graduate early .
because coming back to this house
with my parents split up and ...
melissa being a part of this , it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s getting so much worse .
why can &apos;t i get this ?
sweetheart , there &apos;s a limited amount of tissue paper around here .
are you shaming me ?
you have no shame .
no shame--
oh , man , look at yours .
master at work .
is your son great at this , too ?
no , which is why he &apos;s hiding upstairs .
okay , i &apos;m gonna take a break .
movie time ?
no , i-- i think i &apos;m just gonna go to bed .
really ? but you said this morning you wanted
to watch that one .
that &apos;s why we got it .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
you know what ?
let &apos;s watch it . i &apos;ll rally .
i &apos;m not leaving another voicemail .
who are you trying to call ?
aria . she won &apos;t call me back .
have you heard from aria ?
no , i just got off the phone with hanna though .
what &apos;s with the cop car in your driveway ?
he brought me here so i could get my dad &apos;s numbers in westport .
and i told him i need to pack up a few more things .
how &apos;s hanna &apos;s mom ?
she &apos;s a basket case .
i mean , is this how it &apos;s going to be from now on ?
our parents are going to be physically attacked , too ?
this is not the same &quot; a &quot; who got their jollies
breaking into our lockers and leaving nasty notes .
this &quot; a &quot; is ...
noel kahn .
what did you say ?
i asked noel to break into hanna &apos;s house tonight .
that &apos;s who was in the kitchen . it was noel .
i needed someone who mattered .
someone like hanna &apos;s mom to stop questioning
what happened to me .
why would you do that ?
well , it worked , didn &apos;t it ?
