we need to open it .
i can &apos;t look .
mona &apos;s body might actually be in there .
nervous about something ?
mona vanderwaal retained me to handle her affairs
in the event of her demise .
i was instructed to wait 30 days after her death ,
then deliver this to you personally .
you might need to get a doctor to look at this .
spencer , i have to tell you the truth
before it &apos;s too late .
you must be spencer . i &apos;m colin .
wren and melissa &apos;s flatmate .
welcome to london .
why are you so sure that alison isn &apos;t &quot; a &quot; ?
cyrus told me that &quot; a &quot; had him get alison out of town that day .
cyrus , what happened ?
carjack ?
it &apos;s varjak .
cyrus wasn &apos;t trying to tell us what happened .
he was trying to tell us who did it .
you know i &apos;m gonna have to tell my lawyers about mike ?
ali , please don &apos;t do that .
his testimony might be the only thing that can save me .
veronica reviewed your case and agrees with me .
it &apos;s not a good idea for you to take the stand .
how is telling the truth not a good idea ?
because you don &apos;t have anyone to back up your story .
i told you ,
cyrus petrillo asked me to meet him at the time of the murder .
he set me up .
you also told the police he kidnapped you .
and if you admit that lie ,
no jury will believe anything else you say .
there &apos;s someone else ...
that can testify that i was set up .
who ?
does this person know for a fact
where you were at the time of the murder ?
no , but he--
well , then no matter how compelling their testimony is ,
they won &apos;t be able to corroborate your story .
so what , i &apos;m just supposed to sit here
and pray that you can poke holes in the prosecution &apos;s theory ?
there is another option .
the d.a. is offering a plea bargain .
what does that mean ?
it means that if you plead guilty
and you take responsibility for your actions--
wait . they want me to admit to killing mona ?
yes .
and they want you to name the person that helped you do it .
well , that &apos;s insane .
if you do both , they &apos;ll give you 15 years .
you could be out in 10 with good behavior .
that &apos;s never gonna happen .
alison , this is a big decision .
you need to talk it over with your father .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about , because i did not kill mona .
i &apos;m not advocating you take this ,
i just need you to understand
that the evidence against you is substantial .
if we go to trial ,
the chances of you getting acquitted are not good .
and if you &apos;re found guilty ,
the prosecution will be seeking life without parole .
the police are already building a case
against the person they believe helped you .
who &apos;s that ?
hanna marin .
what &apos;s going on ?
i thought you weren &apos;t leaving till thursday ?
no , i &apos;m sticking with my original plan .
i &apos;m going back today .
i barely even got a chance to see you .
besides , didn &apos;t mom change your flight last night ?
yeah , i &apos;m changing it back .
spencer ,
mom went out of her way to track down her friend
who works at st. andrews .
it wasn &apos;t easy getting you that interview .
i don &apos;t want to go on another interview .
yesterday was embarrassing enough .
it &apos;s not like you to run away .
the spencer i know would stay and nail it
just to prove a point .
okay , i &apos;m not running away .
this just isn &apos;t a good time for me to be here .
why ?
because there &apos;s a lot going on with my friends and ...
toby .
what &apos;s going on with toby ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re not really talking right now .
he became a cop to try to protect me .
and now his job is ruining our relationship .
sounds like being here is what you need .
sometimes relationships run their course .
but you can &apos;t see it until you have a little distance .
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not just about toby .
you know what the best part about living here has been for me ?
getting a fresh start .
away from all the rosewood drama .
yeah , that must be nice .
this could be your future , too .
don &apos;t miss out on the opportunity .
hanna says alison doesn &apos;t know anyone named varjak .
and you believe that ?
why would she lie ? her life is on the line .
yeah , so is mike &apos;s .
we need to talk to cyrus .
if varjak paid him to set up ali ,
then varjak knows who &quot; a &quot; is--
well , i called the hospital this morning .
and the nurse said cyrus had a setback .
he &apos;s in the icu .
maybe mike should tell the cops what he knows .
then he winds up in jail with ali .
better than in the icu with cyrus .
well , i &apos;m not letting either of those things happen to my brother .
maybe ezra can help us .
but he did do a lot of research for his book .
maybe he came across that name at some point .
so i take melissa convince she to stay .
yeah , well , she can be very persuasive .
well , st. andrews is a wicked school .
you &apos;ll love it .
and kate found her prince there .
so who knows , maybe you will , too .
well , a girl can dream .
so listen , i have an extra ticket to the theater tonight .
my mate dropped out this morning .
care to go with me ?
oh , i would love to ,
but i should probably stay in and prep for my interview .
oh , yeah , yeah , no , of course .
it &apos;s just that melissa mentioned you liked shakespeare , so ...
i don &apos;t like shakespeare .
i love shakespeare .
they &apos;re doing hamlet at the rsc .
seriously ?
oh , my gosh , seeing a play at the royal shakespeare company
is on my bucket list .
i didn &apos;t know 18 @-@ year @-@ olds had bucket lists .
is that an american thing ?
no , it &apos;s a hastings thing .
i &apos;ve had mine since i was six .
and hamlet is my favorite .
well , then . it must be fate .
okay .
yeah , i can prep for my interview tomorrow .
but i would like to pay for my ticket .
that &apos;s not necessary .
but if you &apos;d really like to thank me ,
you can buy me a pint after .
we &apos;ll leave at seven .
i wanted you to hear this from me ,
but if anyone asks , this conversation didn &apos;t happen .
okay .
is hanna in school ?
no . she &apos;s up in her room .
she has study hall first period .
alison &apos;s been offered a plea bargain .
part of the deal is to name her accomplice .
i spoke to a friend of mine in the d.a. &apos; s office .
they think it &apos;s hanna .
hanna ? !
no , never in a million years would she hurt mona .
i &apos;m not saying that she did .
but the police have evidence .
what evidence ?
i don &apos;t know all of it .
but i heard that tanner found what she thought
were the remains of a body in a barrel of acid .
the barrel was in a storage unit .
and tanner saw hanna outside the unit that same day .
yesterday , tests were confirmed
that there were bone fragments in the acid .
they were too small to get any dna ,
but tanner believes it &apos;s mona &apos;s .
that &apos;s horrible ...
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a reasonable explanation
for why hanna was there .
one that has nothing to do with mona or alison .
hanna doesn &apos;t even speak to alison .
hanna visited alison in jail , twice .
look , i know this isn &apos;t easy to hear ,
but you have to prepare yourself in case alison takes the plea .
i can certainly recommend an excellent defense attorney .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening to me .
alison &apos;s not gonna take the plea .
she &apos;s innocent , and she knows mona planned this scheme .
well , it &apos;s not gonna be easy to prove .
look , even if she does take the plea ,
she won &apos;t name you as her helper .
she wouldn &apos;t sink that low .
well , i want to believe that ,
but we all know that ali looks out for herself first .
and i &apos;m the easy target !
i &apos;ll go to the jail and talk to her .
no , i &apos;ll go .
maybe if she sees me , it &apos;ll make it harder
for her to ruin my life .
hanna , you can &apos;t go .
you &apos;ll just be giving tanner more ammo .
what &apos;d jason say ?
well , her dad &apos;s with her right now ,
but she &apos;s not taking any other visitors .
why would she do that ?
because she doesn &apos;t wanna face us .
you guys , jason said that her lawyer got her so rattled
about the trial ...
she &apos;s considering taking the plea .
i &apos;m gonna call spencer .
no , if you tell her about the plea ,
she &apos;ll either bomb her interview ,
or she &apos;ll skip it and come home .
do you seriously want to be responsible for her
not getting into st. andrews ?
no , but she &apos;ll kill us
if we don &apos;t tell her what &apos;s going on .
i know , but , let &apos;s just hold off
until we know something more .
fine .
but we should go talk to ezra .
if he has any information on varjak ,
we need to know .
yeah , but i-- i can &apos;t right now .
i have a history test in a few minutes ,
and if i don &apos;t get my grade in ,
i might lose my spot at savannah .
&quot; good luck on your test . hope your ankle &apos;s better .
dinner tonight ? &quot;
andrew .
yeah , andrew campbell .
is there something going on between you two ?
he &apos;s helping me study .
yeah . besides that .
no .
so then why is he asking you to dinner ?
and why are you blushing ?
fine . we kissed .
you happy ?
you kissed him ?
em , do not look at me like that .
what ? he helped me with my ankle last night .
he was comforting me .
and i just kinda got caught up in the moment .
what about ezra ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with us .
and i can &apos;t think about that right now .
so you go talk to him .
and i &apos;ll meet up with you after the test .
okay .
tanner saw both of us there .
after she takes me down , she can go after you , too ,
and it &apos;ll be my fault--
hanna , calm down .
l @-@ look , as far as we know ,
all tanner has on you is her suspicion .
if she had enough evidence to arrest you ,
she would &apos;ve done it already .
wait , so you &apos;re saying if ali doesn &apos;t take the plea ,
this whole nightmare can go away ?
we have to find out
what other evidence the police have on you .
how ?
by talking to toby .
but we &apos;ve already been down that road with toby .
he &apos;s not gonna tell us anything .
i &apos;m not giving him a choice this time .
you need to come home with me .
i never came across the name varjak in any of my research .
are you sure alison didn &apos;t know him ?
hanna found that holly varjaks passport in her attic .
yeah , ali said all that stuff was planted .
everything the lawyer gave us was a set @-@ up .
by mona ?
we don &apos;t know .
i mean , it could &apos;ve been mona or &quot; a. &quot;
are you sure you &apos;ve never seen his name
in any of your research ?
can you please go back and take a look ?
emily , i would remember that name .
no , i know , it &apos;s just , i promised hanna i &apos;d help her .
and finding varjak is our only hope .
we have nothing else to go on .
i mean ali and hanna could be convicted .
and i could be next . or aria .
mona &apos;s lawyer , do you remember his name ?
um , yeah , james neilan . why ?
mona was working for &quot; a &quot; at the time .
and i bet neilan was in on it .
i--i packed so fast ,
i &apos;m either gonna look like i &apos;m going to my interview
or running a 10k .
neither will do for a night out on the town .
here .
how &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s great .
thank you .
isn &apos;t that what sisters are supposed to do ?
share clothes and makeup tips .
i don &apos;t know . we never did .
it &apos;s my fault .
i never should &apos;ve held on to that secret for so long .
why did you ?
at first i was protecting you .
then i was protecting myself .
how do you get over something like that ?
you don &apos;t .
i think about it every day .
i don &apos;t know if i could &apos;ve done it ,
if the roles were reversed .
you never know what you &apos;re capable of
until you &apos;re in the situation .
doing something wrong can seem like the right thing
when you &apos;re trying to help someone you love .
well , i &apos;m hoping we can start over .
yeah .
i &apos;d like that .
okay .
but if it &apos;s gonna work , there can be no more lies between us .
sounds refreshing .
okay , now , before you consider franchising ,
i suggest you open a second location in this area .
that way , you can oversee it .
build up the brand .
makes sense to do that first .
and if that location &apos;s successful ,
franchising would be the next step .
do you have specific questions about how we structure our deals ?
no , actually , i have a few questions about mona vanderwaal .
she was a client of yours , correct ?
why are you asking ?
what i &apos;m wondering is why she hired you to deliver
a package in the event of her death .
you &apos;re not an estate lawyer .
what is this meeting really about ?
did she hire you ?
or did someone pay you to lie and say that she did ?
we &apos;re done here .
an innocent girl is accused of murder .
and i think the person who really hired you killed mona .
and if you just tell me who that is ,
you will save someone &apos;s life .
i suggest you leave before i call security .
mr. neilan , you can tell me or you can tell the police .
hey , sorry , i got here as fast as i could .
ezra &apos;s just in there talking to neilan .
y @-@ you okay ?
yeah ! yeah .
i just haven &apos;t seen ezra in a while .
i just don &apos;t want things to be weird .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be fine .
um , so what did he tell you ?
he wouldn &apos;t tell me anything .
guys , look .
he &apos;s sure in a rush .
hey , are you guys coming or not ?
you &apos;re not going anywhere unl i get some answers .
i already told you ,
i had nothing to do with mona &apos;s murder .
and i said i believe you .
but you &apos;re not making it easy for me .
why won &apos;t you tell me what you were doing at that storage unit ?
because once you know , you can &apos;t un @-@ know .
this isn &apos;t a debate .
you don &apos;t have a choice . you need to tell me now .
hanna !
okay , i--i went there to move everything out of the unit .
i thought mona &apos;s bloody clothes would be there ,
maybe her body .
i thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death .
i didn &apos;t .
but someone put my name on the storage unit &apos;s lease .
and they rented it the day before mona was murdered .
who would do that ?
alison ?
no .
someone is framing her .
and now that same person is trying to frame me .
thank you .
that was my first time buying beer legally .
this country does have its perks .
to hamlet .
to revenge .
what &apos;d you think ?
i thought that the sets were really impressive .
the sets .
right .
so critical to any star shakespearean production .
the lighting was really good .
another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences .
you didn &apos;t like it .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i really wanted to , though . i did .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m such a purist
when it comes to shakespeare ,
that seeing it set in present @-@ day london--
wasn &apos;t your cup of tea .
no . i mean , it was bad enough
that we had to see hamlet in jeans and a t @-@ shirt .
but did he really have to have a cell phone ?
and whose genius idea was it
to have claudius send hamlet a text ?
that would be the director &apos;s .
who happens to be my brother .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
very much so .
no , i thought it was total rubbish , too .
but i &apos;m clearly much more polite than you are .
yeah .
there was one thing that got me thinking .
what if hamlet had made it to england safely ?
do you think he could &apos;ve started over ?
you know , left all that ... darkness behind
and created a new life for himself ?
well , i don &apos;t know about hamlet .
but i believe you can .
you wanna play a game ?
i put our names down on the list while you were getting the pints .
oh , looks like we &apos;re next .
nice .
caleb and i were gonna move the barrel out of the bin ,
but before we could do it ,
tanner and toby showed up .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about this
before you and caleb went there ?
i didn &apos;t want to drag you into my mess .
hanna , i &apos;m your mother .
it &apos;s my job to protect you .
i &apos;m sorry .
you understand how serious this is , right ?
yes .
do you have any idea who is doing this to you ?
i thought it was alison . but it &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t know who it is .
bullseye !
oh , that means i won .
loser buys next round .
ooh , actually , that was just shy of a bullseye .
but good effort .
what ?
melissa did mention you were competitive .
so i guess we have that in common , too .
what else did she mention ?
she said you were bright , driven , loved literature ,
the theater , everything in the arts , really .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah . yeah , go on .
did you really have those hamlet tickets ?
or did you buy them this morning ?
no , no , i had them .
but if i had known
what a lover of shakespeare you were ...
i would &apos;ve gotten them for you .
you &apos;re up .
he &apos;s going in .
who lives here really want to keep people out .
who &apos;s andrew ?
guys , we gotta go .
why are you guys behind me ?
okay , uh , just stay right there .
i &apos;m gonna try to find another way onto the property .
oh , looks like this fence goes around the whole place .
look , why don &apos;t i just take a look around ?
no , emily , we &apos;re not letting you go in there by yourself .
i &apos;ll be fine .
emily , you have no idea who &apos;s in those woods or that house .
by the time that you guys find a way to get in here ,
neilan could be gone .
he came here for a reason . don &apos;t we want to know what it is ?
okay , come on .
hello ?
yeah , i &apos;m going in now .
what &apos;s the combination ?
he &apos;s been helping me study .
andrew .
that &apos;s why he was so excited to hear i did so well on the test .
well , it &apos;s good to hear that he &apos;s supporting you .
well , i got to keep my grades up ,
if i want to keep my spot at scad .
emily mentioned that . congratulations .
thank you .
i was surprised you didn &apos;t tell me yourself .
ezra , i meant to . it &apos;s just been a crazy week .
it &apos;s good to hear you &apos;re not avoiding me .
no . why would i be ?
you know what ? it &apos;s probably best if we split up .
we &apos;ll just cover more territory that way .
call me if you find a way in .
hi , alison .
rebecca .
are you okay ?
if i agree to what you mentioned earlier ,
can you promise me
that they &apos;ll move me to somewhere safer than this ?
the one time i don &apos;t carry an umbrella with me .
the forecast didn &apos;t say rain .
this is london . we have clouds perpetually hovering over us .
right , how about a drink to warm up ?
i make a brilliant hot toddy .
um , i should probably just stick with water ,
and call it a night .
i &apos;m still kind of jet @-@ lagged .
right , i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll let you get some sleep .
colin , i had a really great time tonight .
thank you .
so did i.
actually , it was the best night i &apos;ve had in a long time .
yeah . me , too .
it &apos;s a shame you &apos;re leaving so soon .
london won &apos;t be the same without you .
and the guard said that my lawyer was here .
i just assumed that it was rebecca .
is it true ?
you &apos;re taking the deal ?
well , if the d.a. gives me what i want .
i don &apos;t understand .
yesterday you were so adamant about wanting to tell the truth .
things change .
look ...
i can &apos;t imagine how horrible it must be for you , in here ,
but taking the plea is not the answer .
rebecca says that a jury won &apos;t believe me
if i take the stand .
and that i have too much evidence agnst me .
if i go to trial , i will lose .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
would you be willing to take that risk ?
i admit , you have a difficult case .
and i understand why you &apos;re tempted to take the plea .
but if hanna is innocent ,
and you name her as your accomplice ,
you &apos;ll have to live with that
terrible lie for the rest of your life .
托尼披萨屋
is your mom here ?
no , she &apos;s in town meeting with a lawyer .
why ?
caleb , what &apos;s wrong ?
i just got off the phone with toby .
and ?
did he tell you what evidence they have against me ?
no . he didn &apos;t .
but he wanted me to know that a judge
just issued a warrant for your arrest .
alison took the plea .
i guess so .
how could she do this to me ?
she must &apos;ve panicked .
i &apos;ve got to get out of here .
where are you gonna go ?
i don &apos;t know.anywhere but here .
no , hanna , you cannot run , okay ?
they &apos;ll find you . and it will only make things worse .
how can it g worse ?
i &apos;m going to be arrested for something i didn &apos;t do .
and there &apos;s no way out .
yes . yes , there is .
you can tell tanner about &quot; a. &quot;
i can &apos;t do that .
that is who &apos;s doing this to you .
not alison .
&quot; a &quot; will retaliate .
&quot; a &quot; already has . over and over again .
it &apos;s time to put a stop to it .
this isn &apos;t a decision i can make on my own , okay ?
this affects aria , spencer , and emily just as much as me .
okay , well , you don &apos;t have time to discuss it with them .
caleb , if i tell tanner ,
everything unravels .
all of our secrets , all the lies we &apos;ve told .
the time we were in new york , shana , aria .
okay , well , your friends will understand .
and if they don &apos;t ?
i &apos;ll be screwing them ,
just like alison screwed me .
hanna , the cops are probably already on their way here .
look , i understand that doing this will change everything .
for you , for us , for everybody .
but i don &apos;t see what choice you have .
you can do this .
what if tanner doesn &apos;t believe me ?
you have all of those threats from &quot; a &quot; on your phone .
she &apos;s gonna believe you .
ready ?
yeah .
what do you need to talk to lt. tanner about ?
someone &apos;s framing me and alison dilaurentis
for mona vanderwaal &apos;s murder .
and i can prove it .
what &apos;s your name ?
hanna marin .
hold on . i &apos;ll be right back .
远程遥控
wait , what just happened ? what &apos;s happening ?
somebody hacked into your phone .
they &apos;re wiping it clean .
what ?
tanner will see you .
just you .
i circled the entire property .
there is no way over that security fence .
okay , i &apos;m calling emily .
just not picking up .
emi .
god , you scared the crap out of us !
why weren &apos;t you answering your phone ?
that &apos;s varjak &apos;s house .
wait , so neilan is varjak ?
no , but he &apos;s working for him .
oh , my god .
what ?
hanna &apos;s been arrested .
what do you mean arrested ?
where &apos;s hanna now ?
you guys have to show tanner all of the pictures
and texts on your phones .
if you do , she &apos;ll have no choice but to believe hanna .
we should wait for spencer to get back tomorrow morning .
&quot; let &apos;s all start with a clean slate . - a &quot;
guys , all the texts &quot; a &quot; sent me are gone .
mine , too .
so we have nothing to help hanna .
uh , there is something .
i found this receipt at varjak &apos;s house .
it doesn &apos;t just have his name on it .
it also has his phone number .
so , either varjak is &quot; a. &quot;
or varjak is working for &quot; a. &quot;
this could help hanna .
hanna &apos;s lawyer will do his best to get her out on bail .
but it might not be possible .
they can &apos;t keep her locked up just because alison said
she &apos;s her accomplice .
that &apos;s not why hanna was arrested .
alison hasn &apos;t taken the plea yet .
then why ?
tanner found the clothes mona was wearing the day she died .
and hanna &apos;s blood was on them .
hey , where are you going ?
home .
why ?
hanna was arrested .
arrested ? for what ?
they think she had something to do with mona &apos;s murder .
but she didn &apos;t .
have you talked to mom ?
no , i--i don &apos;t want to wake her .
i &apos;m just gonna call from the airport .
hey , uh , look , spencer ,
i understand that you &apos;re upset ,
and i get that you want to help hanna ,
but i think it &apos;s better that you stay here .
i can &apos;t stay here . i have to be there for her .
what can you do ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
look , i want to reschedule the interview .
what &apos;s mom &apos;s friend &apos;s number ?
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
mom said that you were coordinating the details .
not exactly .
okay , so who is ?
the interview isn &apos;t completely set up .
completely ?
mom--
mom doesn &apos;t have a friend at st. andrews .
but wren &apos;s been calling everyone he knows .
and he &apos;s trying his best to get you in there .
wait a minute .
i &apos;m sorry . let me get this straight .
you and mom pretended that i had an interview ?
mom found out that alison was offered a plea bargain .
part of the deal was to name her accomplice .
we were afraid she might name you .
so you lied to keep me here ?
to keep you safe .
melissa , we just had a conversation about this !
we agreed that we wouldn &apos;t have any more lies between us !
i was trying to protect you !
okay , well , the last time you did that ,
somebody got killed !
yeah , i &apos;ll be right down .
thank you .
it &apos;s my cab .
i was trying to help .
you &apos;re not .
thanks for meeting me here .
yeah , of course .
i , uh , i brought you a muffin . i can &apos;t promise it &apos;s any good .
&apos;cause i &apos;m trying out this new chef .
um , so did you figure out when you &apos;ll be able to see hanna ?
not for a few days .
she still has to be fully processed first .
yeah .
and i couldn &apos;t sleep at all last night .
just thinking about how scared she must be ,
all alone in there .
hanna &apos;s really strong .
i think she &apos;s gonna be okay
till her mom gets her out on bail .
if she gets her out .
look , ezra , uh ...
yesterday you had asked me
if i &apos;d been avoiding you--
look , we don &apos;t have to talk about this now .
i need to .
seeing you made me realize that .
the truth is , i have been .
because i know that ,
once i say what i &apos;m about to say ,
i know that there &apos;s no taking it back .
you were right .
i--i did miss out on a lot of high school
because of our relationship .
and although i don &apos;t regret any of it ,
i think that when i go away to college , i should be single .
yeah , that &apos;s the right choice , aria .
but if we &apos;re going to end it , i think we should do it now .
the past few weeks have been so difficult ,
not knowing where we stood .
and it &apos;s gonna get so much harder if we &apos;re just
counting down the days till you go .
yeah .
it &apos;s just ...
i cannot imagine my life without you .
oh , i know .
you don &apos;t have to .
i want you in mine , too .
we &apos;ll figure something out .
open the gate !
clear !
good news .
the d.a. is willing to let you serve your sentence
in a minimum @-@ security prison in pennsylvania .
i spoke to your father this morning .
he feels it &apos;s your decision to make .
that &apos;s the deal .
take your time . read it over .
if you have any questions , i &apos;ll be right here .
after you &apos;ve signed it , we &apos;ll schedule an appointment
for this afternoon , so you can meet with the d.a.
and tell him the name of your accomplice .
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
i &apos;m not taking the plea .
