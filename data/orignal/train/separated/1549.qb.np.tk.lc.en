do we really have to leave ?
yeah , can &apos;t we just stay a couple more days ?
i know -- it &apos;s killing me .
tomorrow &apos;s open @-@ mic night at the apollo .
look , we &apos;ll all come back . i love it here , too .
compared to new yorkers , i &apos;m laid @-@ back .
now , come on .
get upstairs and pack , or else you might miss your flight .
after a great week in new york ,
i had to get to raleigh for the carolina closet caucus .
phil and i have always wanted
to drive across the country together ,
so we thought we &apos;d make a road trip of it .
bye ! bye , guys !
bye ! bye ! bye !
we &apos;ll miss you !
okay , here &apos;s the deal -- we &apos;re staying another night .
what ?
you heard mom and dad . they said no .
well , we &apos;ll still get home before them . they &apos;ll never know .
oh , come on . andy and i just broke up .
i &apos;m not ready to go back and face life .
come on , how would we even pay for the hotel ?
we can use luke &apos;s carnival settlement money .
no way ! i earned that .
i &apos;m the one who fell off that ride .
we were the ones who really suffered .
we couldn &apos;t turn on lights or make loud noises
until your head got small again .
we can &apos;t use that money . it &apos;s for college .
okay , okay , let &apos;s spend it .
oh , look -- that sushi restaurant we never made it to .
oh , yeah . we tried .
they just never had a table for five .
we had a lot of fun , though , didn &apos;t we ?
yes , we did .
yeah .
never got to get on
one of those horse @-@ drawn carriages through the park .
alex &apos;s allergies .
didn &apos;t know you could be allergic to carriage leather .
still , just so much good family time .
family time .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
you could blow off the convention .
we could stay here for a romantic few days
but never tell the kids because we just made them go home ?
yes !
that is the first time you &apos;ve ever answered that question right .
not today !
oh ! cam , it is so beautiful outside .
you got to --
ohhhh ... right .
we decided to spend the summer in missouri .
but we arrived to find cam &apos;s grandma on her deathbed .
right where we left her at thanksgiving .
hey , um , i wish you &apos;d be a little more mindful
of my family situation .
i &apos;m sorry -- i didn &apos;t realize the vigil
had drifted out to the common areas .
cam , come on .
she &apos;s 95 years old and plugged into a wall .
maybe it &apos;s time to , you know ...
what ? what are you saying , mitchell ?
that we should pull the plug ?
lord o &apos; mercy .
have you even taken your turn sitting with gram ?
no , she doesn &apos;t want me there . she hates me .
this again .
cam , she refers to me as &quot; the sissy . &quot;
you heard that wrong .
she &apos;s hard to understand because of the dentures she inherited .
you know they were made from the keys of a child &apos;s piano .
what do you even say to someone in a coma ?
well , mama &apos;s reading her poetry .
lily &apos;s reciting scripture .
pam and i are gonna sing a song we wrote when we were younger ,
&quot; sweet home ala @-@ gramma . &quot;
okay , yeah , t @-@ teach me that .
oh , i &apos;m sorry -- is she your ala @-@ gramma ?
oh , fine . i &apos;ll think of something .
* onward -- *
sorry .
this collar itches .
stop it . you all look so handsome .
we look like the three amigos .
we were in juarez
for my sweet 19 @-@ year @-@ old cousin marisol &apos;s third wedding .
it was so beautiful .
thank god that they finished that tunnel in time
for her father to make it .
ay , jay , stop with the phone . you &apos;re missing everything .
hang on -- i &apos;m trying to lock up some sausages
for father &apos;s day this weekend .
you wait till the last minute , you wind up eating
chicken and apple , like some damn hippie .
double click !
la diabla . manny , come dance with me .
son of a bitch , that &apos;s good !
hola , jay .
oh , hey ... sonia .
i see gloria &apos;s avoiding me .
she &apos;s still mad because i forwarded her that mass e @-@ mail .
could be that , or it could be the last time you saw her ,
you tried to steal me and kill her .
so , how is my sister ?
fantastic . great .
&apos;course , with joe and also her hot @-@ sauce business ,
she got a lot on her plate .
hey , have you tried one of these mexican cookies ?
they just call them cookies .
i &apos;ll speak with gloria later .
i have to drop this at the gift table .
great .
my seat is cold , and the flowers wilted .
i see that my sister has been here .
will you get over that ?
she couldn &apos;t have been nicer . we talked about joe .
i told her how well your hot @-@ sauce business was going .
by the way , have you tried one of these cookies ?
why did you tell her about the sauce ?
everybody , get your things .
we have to leave juarez right now !
what ? ! it took me 45 minutes to get into this outfit !
you know how crazy sonia can be .
she &apos;s gonna be so jealous now that she knows
that i am a very successful businesswoman .
aren &apos;t you 400 bucks in the hole on that thing ?
you don &apos;t think this looks bad --
us walking out before dinner ?
joe has a fever , and he -- he &apos;s sweating very much .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m gonna reverse what i said .
central park dog rentals -- million @-@ dollar idea .
yeah , and maybe it &apos;s just the high of being on vacation ,
but is there a bird more majestic than the american pigeon ?
get dressed . we &apos;re going out for walk @-@ around breakfast pizza .
oh ! shoot . forgot my room key .
oh ! i &apos;ve got to get a picture of this paneling for my dad .
aromatic cedar flakeboard -- game a @-@ changed .
i love my sexy little closet nerd .
oh , honey .
i &apos;m gonna take a quick tub .
we should check in with the kids from &quot; the road . &quot;
oh , right , right .
we should also maybe get some ice for drinks .
let &apos;s wait for him in the lobby . i need coffee anyway .
the people next door kept me up all night with their sex noises .
i caught the end of that .
he sounded like a scared ghost .
oh , my god . it &apos;s mom .
uh , well , stay calm .
uh , we &apos;re home , we flew in last night .
oh . come on . she &apos;s gonna want to talk to luke .
hi , mom .
hi , sweetie .
i &apos;m coming to you from west virginia .
what are you girls doing today ?
oh , you know , me and alex just out shopping .
who are you talking to ?
dad . who are you talking to ?
mom .
mom .
the girls .
luke .
hold on .
i told them we were in west virginia .
what did you say ?
kentucky .
mom thinks we &apos;re shopping .
i told dad i was making us breakfast .
when have you ever made us breakfast ? !
okay , girls , um , i got to go .
us too . drive safely .
bye .
hey , buddy , i should get going .
there &apos;s a cop walking towards us .
i guess it looks weird with us parked right here
on the state border with me up here in kentucky
and your mom in the back seat over in west virginia .
got it .
i should probably finish packing up the breakfast
i &apos;m bringing to the girls at the shopping mall where they &apos;re shopping .
okay . see ya , pal .
see ya .
that &apos;s how you do that .
done .
* sweet home ala @-@ gramma *
* eyes and hair of gorgeous blue *
i &apos;m gonna come back .
no , no , no . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re up here .
we can finish later .
yeah , yeah .
she likes it when you stroke her hair and rub her feet .
and , mitchell , make sure her tongue stays moist .
how would i -- ugh .
hey , grams .
how &apos;s -- how &apos;s the coma ?
oh , my god . oh , my god !
a @-@ are you trying to say something ?
grams . ow , that hurts . let -- let go .
grams , l @-@ let go .
let go , grams . let go , grams !
what the hell are you telling her ?
what happened ? !
i just walked in ,
and mitchell was telling her to let go , and she did !
oh , let go -- let go of my hair .
somebody call the race track ! get the doctor !
nice turnout . sure is .
grams would hate all these people on her property .
she sure would .
hi .
oh , my god . i can feel your family staring daggers at me .
can &apos;t believe they think i killed grams .
like i &apos;d really be telling her to let go of life .
well , you can see how they &apos;d wonder
after you put your suitcase in her room .
it sounds like you &apos;re taking their side .
you can &apos;t blame them for questioning your story
about a comatose arthritic woman pulling your hair .
not a story . a thing that happened .
fine .
fine .
and you didn &apos;t help your case
by accidentally erasing her &quot; matlocks . &quot;
oh , my god ! just drop it !
no , not -- not the ... no . i -- i ...
okay , so , when do you guys think you &apos;re gonna be back ?
definitely by father &apos;s day .
oh , okay . well , we miss you guys .
but at least it &apos;s still only three more days .
was it a little risky ?
not as long as the master did the talking .
aww . love you both . bye .
we miss you guys .
got to run outside and paint the mailbox .
all you had to do was say goodbye .
now we have to paint the mailbox when we get home .
sorry .
it just popped into my head
when i saw the statue of liberty holding that paintbrush .
you know , what she used to paint freedom in america .
yeah .
the key to a good lie is keep it simple .
well , why don &apos;t i stop talking
about how good it is here and just bring you some ?
okay . bye @-@ bye .
we need to pick up a wheel of arizona spicy sheep cheese .
couldn &apos;t you just say goodbye ? !
claire , the sign says &quot; no loud noises . &quot;
you &apos;ll scare david blaine .
so , he just sits in jello for four days ?
i don &apos;t get how that &apos;s magic .
you wouldn &apos;t .
i wish dad was here .
he &apos;d love this .
well , he isn &apos;t , and neither are we .
remember how luke used to call it &quot; jeh @-@ woh &quot; ?
i hate that i can &apos;t share this with him .
magic isn &apos;t about secrets and tricking people .
phil ! get it together .
like your boyfriend , david blaine ,
we &apos;re taking how we did this to the grave .
i just feel bad that he &apos;s missing out .
this is our thing .
hey !
you will never tell him about this ,
or we will finish what that unlicensed carnival started , okay ?
the morning we were set to fly back for father &apos;s day ,
a storm in the midwest canceled our flight .
let &apos;s just get to the airport , and we will find a flight .
taxi !
damn it ! it &apos;s already taken !
okay , so i think i got us on a flight through denver .
do you mind the middle seat ?
if it &apos;ll help .
this can &apos;t all be carnival @-@ related .
taxi !
taxi !
ay , jay , i was going to cook the sausage .
hey , i don &apos;t mind .
he &apos;s taking over because we screwed up
the last few father &apos;s days .
don &apos;t be silly . i got this .
when i think of the last few father &apos;s days ,
i quake with rage .
hey , maybe put a little thought into it .
maybe we don &apos;t order the pizza .
and if we do ,
maybe we get enough crazy bread for everybody .
i &apos;m sorry , but who made father &apos;s day
the dirty stepchild of holidays ? !
we don &apos;t even have a song .
daddy ?
what ?
got you a present .
that &apos;s my boy !
let &apos;s see . what do we got in here ?
hey . an ice bucket .
i saw manny take shampoos from the hotel .
so i took some things , too .
then some bigger things .
i like stealing .
it makes my heart go fast .
and what &apos;s in the ice bucket ?
a hair dryer . thanks , buddy .
who &apos;s here so early ?
sonia , what are you doing here ?
you left juarez so fast , i didn &apos;t get to say goodbye .
we &apos;re sisters . we shouldn &apos;t fight .
i miss you .
okay , got it .
gloria !
sonia . i &apos;m sorry . come in .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
no , you came from so far away .
come on in . stay awhile .
thank you , jay .
the mexican cookies .
i never thought i &apos;d see those again .
let me help you with those .
hey , aunt sonia .
hola , manny .
i have some luggage in the car . come help me .
okay .
help your aunt . go ahead .
why did you let her in ?
you have to talk to her .
i really think she &apos;s here to apologize .
you don &apos;t know her like i do .
ohh ! wait !
what are you doing ? !
great , jay . now she kidnapped manny .
why are you so calm ?
shouldn &apos;t we follow them or call the police ?
no , it &apos;s just a kidnapping . it &apos;s normal in my family .
ransom call .
mom , i &apos;m really scare--
she wants my hot @-@ sauce business in exchange for manny .
good ! then she owes us 400 bucks .
we get the kid back .
no deal .
i &apos;ll handle it .
my sister , my problem .
my holiday !
oh ! that &apos;s the kids pulling up right now .
just act normal .
i was born normal .
not really . they said i came out with bangs .
hey . now all we have to do is stick the landing .
don &apos;t blow it by acting weird .
oh ! i missed you !
buddy !
oh , how was the drive ? !
oh , it was great .
yeah .
yeah ?
we would have been here a lot earlier ,
but there was a ton of traffic on ...
a @-@ america .
what do you say we go find grandpa , huh ?
yes .
here we go . let &apos;s go .
so , uh , good week ?
same .
oh , my god . they &apos;re talking .
are they ?
all right , you chatterboxes .
let &apos;s get this party started , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s almost 4 : 00 .
1 : 00 .
that was great .
really ?
no . but that &apos;s how you lie .
go splash some water on your face .
hey , guys .
hi ! how are you ?
hi . where are cam and lily ?
uh , they &apos;re still at the farm .
i got banished .
sounds like you &apos;re ramping up to a story ,
but i got some stuff going on , so ...
okay . good to be home .
okay , so cam &apos;s grandmother , the one who called me a sissy ,
she died .
and i -- i was alone with her when it happened ,
and the family thinks that i nudged it along .
cam &apos;s grandma died ?
oh , my god .
you still do that thing where you smile
whenever you talk about death .
it &apos;s just a coping mechanism . it &apos;s gonna pass .
you &apos;ve been doing it since i was 10 years old
and we buried my hamster in the backyard .
his name was whiskers .
can you be a human being for one second ?
so , cam totally took his family &apos;s side
when they all turned against me .
well , that &apos;s just a reflex .
you always take your family &apos;s side .
oh , come on . where is that written ?
remember when you first brought cam home
and i privately said to you ,
&quot; you might want to move on from this one , &quot;
and dad said , &quot; i thought you liked men &quot; ?
and then when cam thought
he was picking up on us not liking him ,
you told cam he was crazy .
i guess i did do that , huh ?
god , you and dad are mean .
aww . says the murderer .
gloria , we can &apos;t sit around doing nothing . call sonia .
tell her to bring manny and the cookies to a neutral place ,
and we &apos;ll make the exchange .
why would i make an exchange ? we have all the leverage .
she has your son .
what is she gonna do ? raise manny ?
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s going to be fine .
there &apos;s got to be a better way .
my parents will be worried sick .
why does she want your sauce business , anyway ?
well , maybe she has a reason to think
that it should be partly hers .
my late aunt
gave that hot @-@ sauce recipe to both of us .
not just gloria .
sonia didn &apos;t care about the recipe .
she was very lazy .
i said , &quot; maybe i &apos;ll go to america and sell the sauce .
try to make something of myself . &quot;
so i gently talked her out of it .
she told me my idea was stupid --
just like all my ideas .
and then i changed my mind , and i did her dream .
what is she so mad about ?
i &apos;m sorry to involve you in this feud .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m actually starting to see your side of this .
thank you .
as long as this isn &apos;t that thing
where the person gets kidnapped and then --
why am only now noticing how beautiful you are ?
ay , dios mio .
surprise !
happy father &apos;s day !
wait -- you guys flew in ?
yeah , i just wanted us to all be together today .
in spite of your thoughtlessness and insensitivity .
okay , those mean the same thing , but okay .
look , i just want you to know
i understand why you took your family &apos;s side .
and i am sorry i put you in that position .
oh , i appreciate that , mitchell .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
can i get our gifts out of the car ?
grams left us all something in her will --
even you .
she left me something ! aww .
even though you &apos;re stubborn and pigheaded .
okay , again -- oh ...
manny &apos;s here .
i had to bring him back .
he was driving me crazy with his googly eyes .
my eyes are but lifeless orbs compared to --
yeah , go get me a beer .
how dare you take my son .
how dare you take my business model .
guys , we have a party going on .
let &apos;s take it over here .
now , gloria , you have admitted yourself
that you have a history of stealing things from this one here .
oh , here we go .
sonia &apos;s perfect ,
and gloria can &apos;t do anything right !
you sound just like my father !
hold on .
are you saying that all this
is about some weird competition over your father ?
this is why you sabotage my whole life ?
because papa loved me more ?
don &apos;t love that .
oh , my god . i guess so .
i can &apos;t believe it .
you are jealous of me .
just in that one area .
but i shouldn &apos;t treat you badly because papa choose you .
it must have been hard for a little girl .
when you lose a love like that at such a young age ,
you spend the rest of your life trying to replace it .
okay .
listen , if you want the hot @-@ sauce business ,
take it -- it &apos;s yours .
no , no . your jealousy is all i need .
i want to give you something that is very precious to me .
not manny .
it &apos;s something that i should have given you a long time ago
that is gonna keep you close to papa forever .
oh ! lily , we were gonna open grams &apos; gifts together !
i couldn &apos;t wait . grams left you a watch .
oh ! the note says ,
&quot; your grandpa tore it right off of
a dead kraut &apos;s wrist . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s so sweet !
and i got these .
&quot; enjoy all my old lipstick ,
you big sissy . &quot;
why did she call me a sissy ?
i -- she doesn &apos;t --
oh ! we &apos;re opening grams &apos; gifts , huh ?
this must be yours .
okay .
let -- you know , we can do this later .
you opened yours .
okay .
&quot; when cam first brought you here ,
i thought i &apos;d never get used to you .
i was raised to hate your kind .
but seeing how happy you make my grandson ,
i ... couldn &apos;t help but come to care for you . &quot;
cam . i was wrong about her .
yes . you were .
now , let &apos;s put this someplace safe .
no , no , wait . there &apos;s more . there &apos;s more .
&quot; who else but you
should inherit my beloved oriental fan ?
i hope it don &apos;t make you homesick . &quot;
she said i was gonna get that fan .
well , you know , she did get very stupid near the end .
okay , well , gift time seems to be over .
okay , cam . this is lily &apos;s gift , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
oh ! so you &apos;re the big sissy !
here .
her lipsticks !
oh . i suppose you &apos;re gonna read into this , too .
wow , those sausages smell fantastic !
you all right , dad ?
yeah , i guess i could say a few words .
i appreciate you guys honoring me on this great holiday .
but i &apos;m not the only dad here .
you three lucked out a little bit in that department , right ?
we sure did .
best job i ever had .
raising two dynamite ladies
and the ... best buddy a guy could ever ask for .
oh , what is with this ?
no crazy bread this year ?
yeah !
we stayed in new york for five more days .
and i saw david blaine in jello ,
and i &apos;ve been dying to tell you , but they wouldn &apos;t let me !
you &apos;re a disgrace .
oh , my god ! your mother and i --
are furious ! furious !
you were in new york this whole time ,
and you didn &apos;t say anything --
now , i don &apos;t know what can of worms this is ,
but i know this is my day ,
and i want you to calm down .
is that a phone in your pocket ?
that &apos;s my phone .
i &apos;ve been looking for this since yesterday .
i steal now .
phil , did you text me ?
oh , yeah , um , claire asked me to send you a picture
of the closet in our new york hotel .
oh , my god ! is this you naked ? !
what ?
why ?
honey , will you send my dad a picture of that closet
before i forget ?
oh ! no .
hey . what &apos;s all the --
o ... kay . no , thanks .
i already have confusing feelings for one relative .
all ... right . can this just be done now ?
how did you even --
wait a minute . it is raining in the background .
but it didn &apos;t rain while we were all there .
it only rained in new york yesterday .
oh , my god ! you stayed in new york without us !
we &apos;re liars !
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , it &apos;s my fault . i -- i kept the lie going .
okay , are we really glossing over the fact
that i figured something out ?
i &apos;ll tell you what else we &apos;re glossing over --
how bad you all are at father &apos;s day .
i &apos;ve got one son who &apos;s a kleptomaniac ,
the other who &apos;s in love with his own aunt --
creepy even by your standards --
and a daughter who i was forced to see naked
as the day she was born .
come on , cam . kiss me like the sissy i am !
right on cue .
oh , god .
happy father &apos;s day to me .
icing on the cake -- i just found out
my own wife has major daddy issues .
makes me wonder if that &apos;s the whole reason she &apos;s with me .
dad , come on .
we may have ruined your day , yes ,
but now you &apos;re just spiraling .
i mean , every relationship has its issues ,
and gloria adores you !
take the win .
you think ?
papa was so handsome .
yes !
yes . yes . yes !
all right !
you each have a sausage on your plate
i selected based on your individual personality and temperament .
is this blood sausage ? because mine &apos;s pink .
oh , my mine &apos;s pink , t--
oh . very funny , dad .
now take a bite of bread ,
a sip of water to cleanse the palate .
mine smells spicy .
show of hands . who heard me say &quot; smell your sausage &quot; ?
the box said these pigs were massaged daily ,
then killed from behind to
keep the panic hormone from tainting the meat .
they were murdered from behind ?
the three things i want you to pay attention to
are bouquet , texture , and finish .
you may begin .
can i have some ketchup ?
we are done here .
