i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m being nosy .
are you eli gold ?
um , eli gold ?
yes .
i knew it .
i saw you sitting there .
i thought to myself ,
&quot; that &apos;s eli gold , the campaign manager . &quot;
i didn &apos;t want to say anything in case i was wrong .
how &apos;s the campaign going ?
good .
well , i am gonna vote for your guy .
i sure will .
thank you .
nice meeting you .
you used to have wooster @-@ graff industries as a client , didn &apos;t you ?
back when you were a crisis manager ?
last year sometime ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . am i being nosy again ?
what do you need , mr ... ?
laguardia .
david is good , though .
i work for the justice department
when i &apos;m not practicing the accordion , so i was just ...
oh , you gotta go ?
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i just wanted to talk to you about a few things . maybe ...
get me leshoure from wooster @-@ graff industries .
greg leshoure on two .
tell him i &apos;ll call him back .
nora , i need your phone .
it &apos;s my mom .
call her back !
mom , i have to call you back .
come on !
diane lockhart .
this is a simple case .
on that , i agree with my respected colleague
for the prosecution .
nine months ago ,
a young woman named brandi colavito
attended alt @-@ o @-@ rama ,
three @-@ day music festival here in chicago .
while there , she was murdered .
the killer then took the body
50 miles south to her hometown ,
in minooka , in grundy county ,
and dumped her .
now asa hellinger has seen fit to charge my client ,
troy mallick ,
a respected executive with a spotless record .
this despite the fact that he had no motive
and there were better suspects in minooka .
so let &apos;s look at the evidence .
her name was brandi colavito .
she lived here in minooka ,
went to minooka community high , graduated ,
and moved away to chicago where she was murdered
after a rock concert .
you will hear evidence that my client ,
gary kuharski , killed her .
he didn &apos;t .
you will hear evidence that he was obsessed with brandi ,
that he stalked her after she broke up with him .
he wasn &apos;t .
you will hear evidence
that he followed her to the chicago concert .
that is untrue .
but what asa hellinger won &apos;t tell you
is that brandi had an ex @-@ boyfriend ,
a young man living in her hometown ,
who became obsessed with her , who stalked her .
now , you might ask the prosecutor ,
why this is being prosecuted here at all ?
the murder didn &apos;t take place in minooka .
it took place in chicago .
yes , the body was transported here ,
but this is big @-@ city business .
not our business .
i &apos;ll tell you why gary &apos;s being prosecuted here .
because cook county didn &apos;t think
there was enough evidence to charge him .
objection , your honor .
yes , ms. hoff , let &apos;s not theorize
on why someone did or did not do something .
and another thing ms. hellinger won &apos;t tell you ,
not only is my client innocent ,
but there is someone in another county ...
objection , your honor !
... being tried for this exact same crime !
someone from minooka ...
your honor , this is outrageous !
yes , outrage is thick in the air . approach .
i &apos;m not sure what the problem is here , your honor .
you gave mr. gardner specific and explicit instructions
which i followed . which i followed to a t.
not to bring up ...
mr. gardner ,
i know you like playing the bad boy .
do it on your own time , not on mine .
your honor , you warned me not to bring up
the name of the man being tried in minooka .
and i have not , even though this is
a gross miscarriage of justice .
has there ever been a mere miscarriage of justice ?
why is it always a gross one ?
you were warned not to bring up
the other trial at all , mr. gardner .
they &apos;re mentioning our trial there , your honor .
yes , and if the judge in minooka wants
to allow that , that &apos;s his prerogative .
he wants a mistrial , your honor .
mr. gardner has delayed this court date for months ,
hoping the other trial would result in a guilty verdict .
i would have to agree .
you &apos;re not getting a mistrial , mr. gardner ,
and i will hold you in contempt and fine you $ 10,000 .
and your next offense ?
you will find yourself in a jail cell .
and if this minooka trial results in a guilty verdict ,
your honor ?
if another person is found guilty of this murder ,
yes , then you may present that evidence to the jury ,
but not before .
do you understand ?
i do , your honor .
all right , then step back .
and , mr. gardner , behave .
how are you enjoying the big leagues ?
is that what this is ?
seemed pretty bush league to me .
mr. state &apos;s attorney ?
i &apos;m alicia florrick--
i left a message with your office .
yes , and the answer is no .
the answer ? i haven &apos;t even asked the question yet .
you want to help me , right ?
if i get a guilty verdict for him ,
your guy in chicago goes free .
well , that &apos;s the hope .
i don &apos;t like defense attorneys , ma &apos;am .
i don &apos;t trust them .
mr. state &apos;s attorney ,
we have access to the cook county medical examiner &apos;s files .
we have an outside forensic analysis ...
good day , ma &apos;am .
hi . he doesn &apos;t want our help .
he will .
kalinda is getting a soil sample tonight .
do a search on a type of soil called clay loam .
oh . um , i &apos;ll write up a brief on it .
how &apos;s troy doing ?
not good . deer in the headlights .
i wish you were here to hand @-@ hold him .
oh , you &apos;re not bad at that yourself .
thanks , but i &apos;m not so sure .
drive safe .
okay .
alicia said to say hi . you all right ?
my parents think the jury doesn &apos;t like me .
one thing i know is you can &apos;t read a jury .
you can &apos;t let &apos; em get into your head .
you just gotta play it cool
and let them know that you &apos;re innocent .
i was approached today by a doj agent
named david laguardia .
approached ?
in what way approached ?
an off @-@ the @-@ record drop @-@ by over lunch .
what did he say ?
he mentioned wooster @-@ graff industries .
i managed the bad publicity
around their ipo last year .
but i left before he said anything more .
good . did something happen at wooster @-@ graff
that i should know about ?
completely aboveboard . completely legal .
then they &apos;re just fishing .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
he gave you this ?
no .
where did you get this ?
i can &apos;t say .
i had the floor checked .
it &apos;s empty . a bankruptcy .
when was this ?
i don &apos;t know . a year ago , maybe .
i moved that painting a bit .
do you want me to go to justice ?
i am in the middle of a campaign , diane .
the rumor of an investigation is often worse than a result .
i need you , if you don &apos;t mind , to keep this confidential .
of course .
no , i mean , from the candidate .
you mean , don &apos;t put alicia on it ?
or will .
can i use the computer , mom ?
for homework ?
yes .
in a minute . i &apos;m almost done .
don &apos;t worry , mom , i got it .
mom ?
uh , yeah , good . okay .
tom szabo .
i work as evidence technician for grundy county .
and you collected evidence at two sites , mr. szabo :
locally , where the body was found ,
and also at the murder site .
yes , i received permission
from cook county to observe their collection there .
and what did you find that was identical at both sites ?
a shoe impression .
this one ?
yes , the one on the right is from the murder scene ,
and the one on the left is from the body site .
and did you find a match for this shoe impression ?
yes , sir . in mr. kuharski &apos;s closet .
they were size 11 saturn running shoes .
thank you , sir . nothing further .
mr. szabo ,
you say you compared the shoe impression
to my client &apos;s sneakers ,
but did you also compare it to troy mallick &apos;s sneakers ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
you &apos;ve already ruled this parallel chicago trial
relevant , your honor .
if the shoe impression matches the chicago defendant ,
that &apos;s highly relevant .
yep , alma , that &apos;s right .
sorry , lee , i will overrule .
i did not compare the impression .
but the illinois crime lab did .
mr. szabo , can you read what it says in their determination ?
&quot; based upon a comparison
of the shoe impressions with the size 11 footwear
worn by troy mallick ,
we determine a match . &quot;
so , you think the shoe impression matches my client &apos;s shoes ,
but the chicago team thinks
it matches troy mallick &apos;s shoes .
which one do you suppose it is ?
objection !
thank you . nothing further .
you &apos;re losing . you need that .
mr. szabo , as a forensic evidence technician ,
did you perform an analysis of the soil
from mr. kuharski &apos;s sneakers ?
yes , but unfortunately ,
i didn &apos;t have a sample
from the murder site to compare it to .
because the lab in chicago failed to release one to you ?
that &apos;s right . there was a bit of a jurisdictional dispute .
i understand .
prosecution exhibit d , your honor .
this is an analysis of the soil from the murder site .
objection . this is not on the prosecution &apos;s exhibit list .
we &apos;ve just become aware of it .
because mr. tripke was handed it
by someone in the gallery .
yes , i think i recognize our illustrious guest .
we &apos;ve had dealings before , haven &apos;t we , ms ... ?
mrs. florrick .
ah , yes .
and you &apos;re providing evidence to our state &apos;s attorney ?
a soil analysis from the crime scene .
there &apos;s nothing prohibiting that .
that is certainly true .
unorthodox , but not prohibited .
i &apos;ll allow , subject to verification .
thank you , your honor .
so , mr. szabo , this analysis shows
that the soil from alt @-@ o @-@ rama , from the murder site ,
was called drummer silt clay loam .
yes , according to this analysis .
and that &apos;s a very unique soil type .
it is .
and could you tell me
what type of soil was found in the tread
of the defendant &apos;s shoe ?
drummer silt clay loam .
and didn &apos;t the defendant say he was never at the concert ?
objection . beyond the scope .
withdrawn .
anything else you have , i &apos;m open .
i &apos;m done with the desktop
if you need the hard line .
the wi @-@ fi &apos;s working now . thanks .
what did i do ?
nothing .
the dent was already there .
zach , i &apos;m ...
what dent ?
the dent on the car .
it was already there .
someone must have opened their door and hit it .
okay . um , that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i @-@ i was just , um ,
wondering how you are .
good .
good .
and nisa ?
you &apos;re still dating ?
yeah .
how old is she now ?
nisa ? 15 .
i thought you liked nisa .
no , i do .
um , i &apos;m just wondering ...
do we need to have a conversation ?
about ?
sex .
uh , mom , no .
no , i &apos;m fine , really .
well , we agreed that if there was ever anything
you needed to talk about ...
yeah , and there &apos;s not . really , i &apos;m good .
and we already did talk about that .
i ... i did a search on my computer ,
and when i typed in the question ,
it said that the previous search
was for types of condoms .
and you thought it was me
that searched for types of condoms ?
well , i mean , you use the hard line .
so does grace .
grace ?
yeah .
and she &apos;s seeing connor now .
she &apos;s seeing him ?
yes , and i would never hunt on your computer .
and if i did , i know how to scrub a search cache clean .
okay , thanks .
let &apos;s not rub your sophistication in my face , please .
mrs. florrick ?
nick saverese is waiting for you in the conference room .
do you know why ?
no . he didn &apos;t seem happy .
i don &apos;t want cary on my case .
you don &apos;t want cary ? why ?
i want you or one of the other partners .
well , i &apos;m working on something full @-@ time at the moment .
is there a specific problem ?
yeah , he accused me of running drugs .
he ...
how did he do that ?
well , he came to my lot and he said , as my lawyer
and as a friend of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
he knew what i was doing ,
using the cars we towed to move drugs .
would you give me a minute ?
mr. saverese , i talked to the partners
and we must apologize ,
but we can &apos;t represent you anymore .
really ? why ?
it &apos;s not to our benefit .
okay .
you know , the last time it weren &apos;t to your benefit ,
the partners took me back .
they sent me an apology with a gift basket .
yes , but that was when you had a $ 25 million governmental bid .
you lost that some time ago ,
and it doesn &apos;t look like you &apos;re getting it back .
you didn &apos;t talk to the partners .
you talked to cary .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. saverese , we have to let you go .
i know you &apos;re the wife of the state &apos;s attorney .
you don &apos;t want to say anything to anyone
about this drug charge .
ever .
attorney client privilege and all that .
here &apos;s the thing , mr. saverese ,
attorney client privilege is voided
if i &apos;m threatened .
so let me ask you this ,
and i suggest you take a moment before answering .
are you threatening me ?
you decide .
brandt claussen , ols security .
we are first and we are fast .
and on the night in question ,
were you working security for alt @-@ o @-@ rama ?
i was .
and you tell us ...
no , strike that .
did you see the defendant
with the victim , brandi colavito ?
yes . i saw them fighting ,
yelling at each other .
and afterwards ?
well , he basically followed her into the woods ,
where the concertgoers camp and i
and i heard her screaming .
you heard brandi screaming . what was she screaming ?
objection , hearsay .
res gestae exception , your honor .
overruled . you may answer .
&quot; get away from me . stop it . &quot;
and then it just suddenly stopped , her screaming .
so then i basically ran into the woods
to see what happened ,
and i couldn &apos;t find her at first .
but then i found the bloody clothing .
no sign of troy ?
no . i guess i got there too late .
he must have taken the body .
objection , your honor . speculation .
sustained . mr. gardner , i &apos;ve concluded my questioning .
thank you , asa hellinger .
so , mr. claussen ,
you heard brandi screaming , &quot; get away from me . stop it . &quot;
and how far away were you at this time , approximately .
from the screaming ?
i guess about 80 yards .
and you heard it clearly ?
yes . it was awful .
and what are these ?
earplugs .
and you &apos;re provided these by the stadium
because of the loud music to keep you from going deaf ?
yes .
were you wearing them that night ?
was that a yes ?
yes .
could you put them in ? i &apos;d like to try something .
objection , your honor .
must we have the dramatics ?
well , the witness has sworn to hearing the screaming .
i just want to see if he could .
a little drama never hurt anyone , ms. hellinger .
please put them in .
now i &apos;m gonna ask my associate to step out into the hall .
that &apos;s not exactly 80 yards .
it &apos;s probably 30 .
can you just tell us what you hear , mr. claussen .
i &apos;m sorry . just tell us what you hear .
i &apos;m not being murdered !
i &apos;m just screaming in the hallway !
cute .
thanks . offer a plea bargain .
why ?
i hear it &apos;s going very well in minooka .
they find their guy guilty ,
your case evaporates .
yes , and if their guy confessed ,
my case would evaporate , too , but it &apos;s not gonna happen .
matan .
i think i need your help .
hey , i thought you were heading up to minooka .
i am .
i &apos;m late .
what &apos;s wrong ?
should i be afraid of your husband ?
no .
why ?
he was here .
when ?
this morning .
i told him we were no longer representing him .
he didn &apos;t take it very well .
he &apos;s worried that
cary and i might tell someone that he &apos;s moving drugs .
did i do the right thing ?
telling him we no longer represent him ?
and i &apos;m not in danger ?
no .
you won &apos;t be .
good .
captain tim resnick ,
chief of investigations at the minooka police department .
and did you have any official contact with mr. kuharski
prior to arresting him for murder ?
yes , three months ago ,
i was called to the scene of a domestic dispute .
mr. kuharski had beaten brandi around the face and neck .
did you arrest him at that time ?
we did .
but he posted bail ,
and brandi declined to press charges .
and was this the last time
you found the two in such a situation ?
no , brandi eventually obtained a restraining order against him .
thank you , detective .
your witness .
they &apos;re getting help from cook county--
that man is an asa .
alma , you have something there ?
uh , yes , your honor . we do .
detective resnick ,
when did you first turn to my client as a suspect ?
when did i ?
probably after i saw the murder scene evidence
from the chicago police .
hmm , not before ?
you didn &apos;t have any foregone conclusions before ?
no , always keep an open mind .
odd , because i have here the notes
from a detective collier of the chicago police .
objection , your honor .
that is not on the exhibit list .
yes , we just became aware of it .
yeah , we seem to have a very odd situation here .
a chicago defense attorney helping our prosecutor
and a ... i &apos;m sorry .
would you like to introduce yourself , sir ?
matan brody , your honor ,
cook county asa .
just call me murph .
a chicago defense attorney helping our prosecutor .
a chicago prosecutor helping our defense .
i thought i &apos;d seen it all .
your objection is overruled , lee .
please proceed , ms. hoff .
i &apos;m aglow with anticipation .
as i was saying ,
i have the chicago detective &apos;s notes here .
perhaps you could read from the highlighted portion .
&quot; received a call from detective resnick in minooka . &quot;
strongly believes killer is ex @-@ boyfriend . &quot;
yeah .
sounds like prejudging to me .
objection , your honor .
sustained .
what ?
matan is here , helping the defense .
you &apos;re kidding .
having some trouble out there in minooka ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
i wonder what the taxpayers would say
about you helping the defense
in another county get a murderer off .
probably the same thing your creditors would say about
you sending the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s wife .
whoever loses buys the other drinks .
you &apos;re gonna lose .
no music today , mr. gold ?
mr. laguardia ,
i have asked my client not to answer your questions .
please talk to me only .
certainly . what do you need , ms. lockhart ?
why is the public integrity division looking into my client ?
who says we &apos;re looking into anything ?
well , if you &apos;re not , then consider this a polite request .
don &apos;t approach or surveil my client again .
any further such efforts would be considered harassment .
i only approached your client once--
that hardly warrants , uh ...
ms. lockhart , uh ...
you &apos;re showing ...
this is a photo i have no previous knowledge of .
if what you showed me is indeed doj work product ,
whoever gave you that photo broke the law .
good to know , now , what are you after ?
you know my division investigates campaign finance violations .
yes , which has nothing to do with mr. gold &apos;s crisis management .
except some of mr. gold &apos;s biggest clients have recently
become donors to his wife &apos;s campaign .
you &apos;re kidding me .
eli ...
there is nothing illegal about clients exercising
their first amendment rights .
as long as it &apos;s at arm &apos;s length , yes .
but a quid pro quo in which mr. gold
offers savings to crisis management client
in trade for contribution to a political campaign ,
that is illegal .
discount for donations .
and that is what you &apos;re accusing ?
no ... that is what we are investigating .
your honor , we ask that the following evidence be admitted .
cook county crime scene photos of the car trunk
belonging to troy mallick .
got something from your cook county friend here , have you ?
yes , your honor .
it is lovely how prosecutors , defense attorneys
are all working together here .
it gives one hope .
we also ask that the accompanying evidentiary report
of fabric trace evidence be admitted .
objection , your honor .
this evidence is subject to
fruit of the poisonous tree exclusion .
someone illuminate me here-- what is this evidence ?
that &apos;s right . take your time .
your honor , this is evidence collected from the car trunk
of the chicago defendant troy mallick .
the man with whom the victim attended the concert .
now as you can see ,
trace evidence from the victim &apos;s clothing
was found in his car trunk ,
suggesting the chicago defendant transported the victim ...
no , it does not suggest that .
the chicago defendant explained this evidence .
he carried a grocery bag ...
sleeping !
sleeping bag in his trunk .
and the fabric transferred from the bag .
well , if the prosecution believes that ,
then let them argue it in court .
your honor ,
the chicago police searched the trunk without a warrant ,
that is why this evidence was barred from court .
yeah , no , chicago court , not minooka court .
but the same rules apply .
no ! fruit of the poisonous tree argument applies
to due process of the chicago defendant .
she &apos;s using that as exculpatory evidence
for a totally different defendant .
yes , but due to the constitutional exclusion ,
this evidence was never subject
to the same stringent analysis as the defendant in chicago ...
thank you . thank @-@ thank you .
one and all .
what we have here is a battle of the proxies ,
and unfortunately , ms. florrick , mr. tripke ,
the fruit of the poisonous tree grows in chicago .
its limbs do not extend here .
we will allow this evidence .
what else you got ?
i &apos;ll get back to you .
use the one in the living room !
it &apos;s me .
oh , mom . hey , sorry .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
why does everyone think something &apos;s wrong
when i come to their room .
everyone ?
who &apos;s everyone ?
my children-- my various children throughout chicago .
are you all right , mom ?
too many hours in court .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
and how &apos;s connor ?
connor ?
he &apos;s good , i guess . why ?
tell me about him .
about connor ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know-- i already did .
no ...
i only know that you ...
go to the same school
and that his girlfriend was the one who did that ...
not his girlfriend-- they broke up .
okay , um ...
tell me about him .
okay . uh , well , he &apos;s nice .
um , he wants to live in thailand .
there &apos;s this one city in thailand
where , um , they have a festival once a year
and basically everyone throws water at each other .
so , it &apos;s like this massive citywide water fight .
and @-@ and he wants to do that after school ?
well , just for a year .
ah . and then he &apos;ll go to college .
so , you two have gotten close ?
just as friends .
and he &apos;s a christian , too ?
no .
but you are ?
you &apos;re still a christian ?
you don &apos;t have to say &quot; a christian &quot;
you can just say &quot; christian . &quot;
and , yeah . why ?
you used the hard line on my desktop computer ?
yeah .
someone did a search there .
trying to find out about ... something .
what ?
condoms .
oh , my god , mom !
i didn &apos;t know ... i didn &apos;t know if it was you .
oh , no !
and if it was , it is not a problem .
but i think maybe we should talk about it .
you really think i &apos;d use your computer
to find out about condoms ?
i didn &apos;t know . we haven &apos;t had a talk .
because i don &apos;t want to .
well , maybe we need to have it now .
no , mom . no , thanks , really .
i really don &apos;t want to .
you okay ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re being a good girl ?
i &apos;m being a good girl .
okay , good .
i &apos;m here if you need to talk .
brock dalyndro-- d @-@ a @-@ l @-@ y @-@ n @-@ d @-@ r @-@ o.
and did you attend the alt @-@ o @-@ rama concert last may ?
yeah . all three days-- it was killer .
could you please tell us what you saw ?
i was coming back to the campsite ,
sabbath had just finished their set , and my head was ringing .
and , uh , i saw a guy coming out with a blanket over his shoulder ,
putting it into the trunk of a car .
how far away were you from this man ?
maybe ten , 15 feet .
so , close enough to see there was something in the blanket ?
objection , leading .
sustained .
why did you notice this blanket ?
well , i saw what looked like a body in it .
from the way he was carrying it .
objection , speculation .
sustained .
do you recognize that man you saw in this room today , brock ?
yeah ... him .
the witness is pointing to the defendant ,
troy mallick . nothing further .
try getting out of that one .
mr. dalyndro , had you been drinking the night of the concert ?
i had a few beers , i guess .
a few-- how many is that ?
maybe seven or eight ?
okay , you done any drugs ?
i might &apos;ve smoked a little pot , but ...
but it wasn &apos;t mine though .
uh @-@ huh . uh @-@ huh , so you smoked pot ,
you drank seven or eight beers ,
it was dark out , crowded , noisy ...
yeah , but i know what i saw .
you saw a man carrying a blanket ?
yeah . with a mountain on it .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
the blanket , it ...
it had this mountain peak on it .
i see . that seems to be a new detail .
you never mentioned that to the police .
well , i never thought of it till now .
uh @-@ huh . and what else might you think of in another week &apos;s time ?
objection .
sustained .
now , let &apos;s turn to your identification of this mysterious man .
your honor , may we approach the bench ?
excuse me , ms. hellinger , i &apos;m in the midst of questioning .
your honor ?
please approach .
your honor , it gives me no delight in saying this ,
but i believe the defense is prepared to contravene your ruling .
what ?
mr. gardner intends to show
this witness a photo of a man wearing an identical shirt
to trick him into iding him as the killer ,
then reveal it &apos;s , in fact , the accused in minooka .
what ?
how do you know this , asa hellinger ?
yes , how do you know this ?
i don &apos;t , your honor ,
but i &apos;ve caught on to mr. gardner &apos;s tricks .
this is just outrageous .
i believe that that photo there on the defense table
is , in fact , the minooka defendant .
let &apos;s see it , mr. gardner .
your honor ...
let &apos;s see it .
let &apos;s see it .
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
yes , it &apos;s that photo ,
but the real galling thing here
is that the jury will never be allowed to know
that minooka killer could be easily confused for my client .
yes , thank you .
that &apos;s ten more thousand dollars in contempt fines ,
mr. gardner , now , step back .
what does it feel like to be so predictable ?
tell nick i &apos;ll be at work .
it &apos;s time to end this .
i learned my second piece , mr. gold , &quot; danny boy &quot; &quot;
congratulations .
the accordion .
at first , i thought ,
who plays the accordion , but then i kind of liked it .
it &apos;s unusual . mm .
the fed who plays the accordion .
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve looked into wooster @-@ graff industries donations
to vanessa gold .
i &apos;m sorry , do you want to talk more about accordions ?
no , done .
we &apos;ve looked into the donations
to vanessa gold &apos;s campaign ,
and we feel confident that eli has done nothing wrong .
well , that &apos;s great . phew .
but given that mr. gold &apos;s campaigns are highly visible ,
we want to know how we can satisfy the justice department &apos;s
insatiable appetite for information .
a proffer .
as to what ?
indiscretions by the candidate .
i &apos;m not gonna turn on my ex @-@ wife .
no . peter florrick .
you &apos;re accusing mr. gold
of soliciting illegal donations for peter florrick ?
no . but we would be willing to drop any charges against mr. gold
in trade for a proffer on mr. florrick .
go to hell .
i would advise you
to talk things over with your lawyer , mr. gold .
i &apos;d imagine she &apos;d urge patience .
after he cools down , have him give me a call .
go to hell .
he &apos;s lying .
making up details-- a mountain on a blanket .
i don &apos;t think he was lying .
troy &apos;s company is called watercleanse .
it &apos;s a home @-@ filtering water company .
and that
is their logo .
i &apos;m not sure what ...
turn it upside down .
there &apos;s your mountain .
it was on a blanket , not a ...
our client is guilty .
we don &apos;t know that .
you &apos;re right , we don &apos;t .
and either way , we have a duty to
zealously represent our clients .
what about the defendant in minooka ?
what about him ?
i &apos;ve been helping the prosecution convict an innocent man .
no , you &apos;ve been supplying the prosecution with
true information to help them win a case .
yes . against an innocent man .
so what do i do ?
out there in minooka ?
do i continue to help them convict a man i know is innocent
in order to represent my client who i know is not ?
we have to zealously represent the interests of our client .
it &apos;s our job .
we can hate it ,
but it &apos;s our job .
and that &apos;s why your office
never considered my client a suspect ?
yes .
there was too much real evidence
to support our suspect in chicago .
the trace evidence from the victim &apos;s dress ...
yes . it &apos;s true we couldn &apos;t present it in court ...
anything else ?
... but it was a damning picture .
go for tillman .
nothing further , your honor .
mr. brody , you are quite confident
that your defendant in chicago
is the person responsible for this crime .
yes , sir .
and were you equally confident
with the ryan tillman murder case ?
that wasn &apos;t my fault .
yes .
but were you equally confident ?
objection , your honor , relevance .
what is this case ?
a murder that mr. brody prosecuted
that sent a man to prison for ...
ten years .
he was recently exonerated .
no , alma , i will allow .
it goes to credibility .
were you equally confident
prosecuting mr. tillman ?
sex
okay .
you have another problem .
just one ?
that was the employer of the defendant in minooka .
it &apos;s a landscaping company ,
and it uses the same soil treatment
as the concert campground .
yeah .
so ... the soil on gary kuharski &apos;s shoes
was probably from his work site .
so i gave the prosecution inaccurate evidence .
and i can &apos;t tell them , can i ?
well ...
it &apos;ll become public record .
and then the state &apos;s attorney could use it against our client .
yep .
so i have to keep my mouth shut ,
while an innocent man may go to jail .
it &apos;s one of those dilemmas that doesn &apos;t come up in law school .
no . no , we can &apos;t win without downstate anymore .
we need to hit maddie right in her base of su ...
yeah ?
um , mr. gold , you better come out here .
you &apos;re gonna want to seize the hard drives ,
all the cell phones .
someone &apos;s got to get started on those files over there .
hi , mr. gold . so good to see you again .
what the hell are you doing ?
we are raiding your office .
you &apos;re gonna want to wrap up that call right now .
over there . yep .
shut it down , shut it down .
you can keep your coffee . yeah , print .
hang it up . hang it up right now .
you , too , bud .
hey , mom ?
mm . hey , i am running late .
i was thinking about what happened with your computer ,
so i ran a cache search .
um , sometimes if you haven &apos;t cleared your cache ,
you can tell when a certain search was run .
well , i can pretty much say i &apos;ve never cleaned my cache .
it was thanksgiving night .
12 p.m. that &apos;s when the search was run .
well , we were all here then .
yeah , we were , but ...
here , look at this .
two minutes before ,
the browser logged into that e @-@ mail page .
which means ... ?
that &apos;s grandma &apos;s e @-@ mail page .
my mom &apos;s ?
no . jackie &apos;s .
i ...
uh , so you &apos;re saying she ...
zach ?
yeah ?
we never speak of this again .
i &apos;m good with that .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
i understand you have reached a verdict .
yes , we have , your honor .
very well .
would you read the verdict , please , mr. foreman ?
in the matter of the people
of the state of illinois v. gary l. kuharski ,
on the charge of first degree murder ,
we the jury find the defendant ...
... guilty .
... guilty .
you heading out ?
well , i was thinking about it .
i think i owe you .
okay .
you were good .
thank you .
you were , too .
it &apos;s tough to get them off when they &apos;re guilty .
let &apos;s agree to disagree .
either way , tough break for the guy in minooka .
our case is over .
our guy got convicted .
meaning ... ?
our duty &apos;s discharged .
so if we have anything that could help that guy on his appeal ...
we can use it .
okay .
to the next one .
i can &apos;t wait .
you know , the next time you want to get my attention ,
just give me a call .
there won &apos;t be a next time .
why &apos;s that ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re leaving .
am i ?
where am i goin &apos; ?
i just made a call to the police
about your tow truck operation smuggling drugs .
that &apos;s a shame .
cops are already at the yard , nick .
it &apos;s too late .
there &apos;s nothing here for you anymore .
so your best bet ...
is to cross the border here .
and here &apos;s a key ...
to a locker at the point edward bus station .
i placed half my $ 20,000 there .
i want you to take it ,
and go .
you know there &apos;s nothing left between us , nick .
nothing .
so why don &apos;t you get the hell out of here ?
i don &apos;t think you did call the cops .
that &apos;s not your style .
so ...
what &apos;s your plan b ?
kalinda , i &apos;m just wondering where you are . give me a call .
what did i miss ?
oh . not much . where were you ?
out .
you look relieved .
i &apos;m .
he &apos;s gone .
and you &apos;re safe ?
yeah . you are , too .
good .
what if he comes back ?
he &apos;s not coming back .
you sure ?
yes .
