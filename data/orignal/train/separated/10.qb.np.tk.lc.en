well , i was just talking to--
sorry , clarke , i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m at lockhart / gardner and i can &apos;t--
hello .
i was here about the joint client agreement
and diane lockhart just asked me when we were coming in
to discuss the merger .
&quot; merger &quot; ?
yes . are we merging with lockhart / gardner ?
um , uh ... i think this is something coming from alicia .
they want our clients , cary .
they don &apos;t want us .
if we merge , they will squeeze us out .
we &apos;re the small fish . they &apos;re the big .
i know . let me talk to alicia .
you--
go ahead .
i don &apos;t want to be the one saying this ;
and you must understand ,
i &apos;m speaking purely about the bottom line--
we have to make decisions without alicia .
yes . clearly , she is having ...
some difficulties .
you are a co @-@ managing partner .
in her absence , it &apos;s within your rights .
did they add questions to your last test ?
what ?
your last lie detector test ,
did they add any other questions ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess .
they always do . why ?
like what questions ?
uh , nothing . they just usually keep it to the same 20 questions .
but they added one ? what was it ?
&quot; did you take any confidential materials home ? &quot;
yeah , they &apos;re worried about the next snowden .
shut up , j.
no . he &apos;s right .
someone in this office
has been leaking information to the press .
how do they know that ?
ip addresses or something .
that &apos;s why they &apos;ve doubled up on the lie detector tests .
are you worried ?
no .
no . it &apos;s just more crap .
you know what you got to do ?
what ?
* you gotta fight *
* for your right *
* to ma ... sturbate . *
hello .
i have another legal problem .
finn ?
yeah .
yeah . they told me you were at home .
i am . i &apos;m heading out now .
they &apos;ve taken my computer .
who has ?
i don &apos;t know .
i returned from court and i &apos;m staring at a computer
that looks like mine ,
but they &apos;ve stuck the post @-@ it notes in the wrong places .
well , what was on it ?
everything .
anything that can hurt you ?
i don &apos;t think so , but ...
... it does have my notes for the jeffrey grant prosecution .
okay . let me talk to the state &apos;s attorney .
i &apos;d rather do it .
no . you need a lawyer .
don &apos;t be your own lawyer .
you know , they did ask me a new question .
what ?
on the lie detector test ,
they asked me a new question .
what ?
did i know any co @-@ worker
who took confidential materials home ?
and what &apos;d you say ?
well , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
was that wrong ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry . i was under the impression
alicia was the named partner .
yes , and there &apos;s an agos to her florrick .
who &apos;s that ?
cary . talking about the merger .
but why wasn &apos;t i brought into the loop ?
he sounds different .
yeah , i know .
alicia doesn &apos;t control this firm .
it &apos;s both of ours .
then consider it , cary .
a merger would benefit both of us .
no . it would benefit you .
you &apos;re overextended .
we are both overextended .
no . we &apos;re a start @-@ up .
our natural state is to be overextended .
you are mismanaged .
yeah . he &apos;s kicking ass .
now , all i &apos;m saying is ,
we need three @-@ year guarantee of untouched chumhum revenues .
we &apos;ll give you one year .
diane ...
i &apos;m not negotiating . i &apos;m stating .
um ... i have to go .
uh , talk to alicia .
i mean , see what she wants .
well , alicia &apos;s out sick
and i &apos;m making the decisions in the meantime .
good to know .
so , are we merging or what ?
we need to do something .
i &apos;ve been in the new york office .
we need more chicago support .
actually , i &apos;ve had a change of heart .
i think we should hold off on any merger talk .
really ?
florrick / agos not coming together ?
i think we should take some time
before we make such a big decision .
i would tend to agree .
well , when you argued so passionately about a merger ,
diane , i made a couple of calls
and discovered a possible suitor .
don &apos;t you want to know who ?
hello . i &apos;m louis canning .
i know some of you , and some of you i want to get to know .
diane .
first things first ,
uh , these movements that you see
are from a neurological disorder i suffer from ,
called tardive dyskinesia .
well , we don &apos;t discriminate here .
if people vote against our merger ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be for other reasons
than your disorder .
i want to say how much ...
i respected will gardner .
in fact , i &apos;m a bit overwhelmed just sitting this far--
sorry .
this far from his office .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s smiling down on us and saying ,
&quot; don &apos;t make any dumb decisions . &quot;
dear god . are you really thinking of
putting the fox in charge ?
diane , just because he has a condition--
he bankrupted us . remember ?
we went to bankruptcy court because of him ?
diane , i know we &apos;ve been on opposite sides
with other cases , but ...
i &apos;m sincere when i say i need what you have .
and you need what i have .
what do you have ?
infrastructure in new york and l.a.
don &apos;t reveal all your crime scene photos at once ,
or the jury will become immune .
&quot; the truth must dazzle gradually ,
else every man be blind &quot;
mrs. florrick .
come on in .
then deliberately hand the photos to the jury .
you want them to touch them ,
feel responsible for them ...
in order to encourage your defendant
to accept a plea bargain ...
great . go forth ,
and do likewise .
double homicide on 51st .
so ...
am i a disappointment to your husband ?
what ?
no .
just , um ...
having trouble getting him on the phone .
well , he &apos;s ...
busy .
are you okay ?
yes . may i sit down ?
yeah , of course . would you like some water ?
no .
why did you take finn polmar &apos;s computer ?
did i take finn polmar &apos;s computer ?
finn polmar &apos;s computer was taken
and he works for you .
well , there &apos;s a disciplinary panel
established by my predecessor , your husband .
the internal standards unit . it is investigating finn &apos;s case .
if we &apos;re talking about the jeffrey grant prosecution ,
we already ...
no .
all finn &apos;s cases .
sondra ?
do you have my other shirts ? i spilled juice on it .
he &apos;s just sitting at your desk .
he won &apos;t talk to me .
who ?
this is cary agos . you can tell him .
hey . what do you need ?
hello .
i need a lawyer .
you work for the nsa ?
i &apos;m an independent contractor .
for the nsa ?
yes .
and ... that &apos;s all you can tell us ?
i think i &apos;m in trouble .
i need legal advice .
what kind of trouble ?
i took home a flash drive from work , um ...
and i uploaded something to my home computer .
okay . what was on it ?
a valentine , for my sister &apos;s kids .
i drew it up at work ,
but there were some ... confidential things
on the flash drive , too , and they &apos;re asking questions about it .
&quot; they &apos;re &quot; ?
my system admin .
we get weekly lie detector tests .
they &apos;re ... they &apos;re asking if anything confidential went home .
alicia , hello .
the nsa is no joke .
you can &apos;t talk on the phone , or e @-@ mail or text about me
or anything to do with me .
we use burners ,
and we change them up every three days .
no , you can &apos;t use any phones .
i &apos;m serious .
why ? are they listening to us ?
no .
then what are you worried about ?
every call you make ,
every text , every e @-@ mail any of us makes ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s sucked up and stored by the nsa
until it serves some later purpose .
there are word searches that could pop my name
or my circumstances up to the top .
okay . give us a day to discuss strategy .
actually , we need to discuss this .
no , we don &apos;t .
why can &apos;t you tell them
you took the flash drive home accidentally ?
everyone is worried about the next snowden .
they won &apos;t believe me .
i don &apos;t want to disappear one night .
okay .
come by tomorrow , this time .
what happened to discussing cases ?
we &apos;ve had to make decisions while you were out .
we can &apos;t take on any cases involving the u.s. government .
we did at lockhart / gardner .
yes , and when we &apos;re as big as lockhart / gardner ...
you don &apos;t need to get involved .
alicia florrick .
alicia , how are you ?
mr. canning ?
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m just calling to check in .
well , is there something you need ?
well , come to think of it , yes .
i @-@ i need my client back .
your client ?
which one is your client ?
chumhum .
wh @-@ what &apos;s this about , mr. canning ?
oh , that &apos;s right , you haven &apos;t heard .
uh , my firm is merging with lockhart / gardner .
we &apos;re lockhart / gardner / canning , now .
we decided to keep will &apos;s name .
it was a nice gesture , don &apos;t you think ?
oh , wait a minute .
sorry , i ...
lost my pen , i ...
almost got it .
almost .
no . i can &apos;t , i &apos;m sorry . would you mind ?
sure .
thanks .
i &apos;m just getting used to my new surroundings .
you got it ?
no .
ah , my hero .
thank you .
you needed something ?
is that will &apos;s ?
why don &apos;t i come back later ?
wait .
look , i know he &apos;s your friend
and i know you hate that i &apos;m here .
but i &apos;m gonna have to go over will &apos;s last 20 cases ,
and i need everything you got .
no , no , no . the real information .
the state of all investigations ,
total result in costs , bad facts , good facts .
i need everything you got .
kalinda , i &apos;m your boss now . i need your help , please .
great , last 20 cases going back to july .
i need everything that he sent out
to new york or l.a.
okay .
i know it &apos;s your instinct to run back to diane ,
and tell her everything i just asked for .
and my guess is it wouldn &apos;t make a damn bit of difference
if i told you it was confidential , so it &apos;s not .
but you &apos;re gonna have to learn to trust me real quick .
i &apos;m the new will .
you &apos;re not the new will .
so , we discussed it , and we have a plan .
you need to be a whistleblower .
i ... ? - you &apos;re not protected if you took home
the flash drive accidentally .
but you are protected if you took
the flash drive home due to wrongdoing .
well , what &quot; wrongdoing &quot; ?
well , that &apos;s the question .
have you seen any wrongdoing ?
no , seriously .
we have something worked out for you .
but you have to do exactly what we say .
okay . first you go back to work .
and you act like it &apos;s a normal day .
there &apos;s a new one .
russian car crash video ?
yeah .
cows ?
no , men with machetes .
i &apos;ve seen it .
not this one .
it goes on like that for a mile !
i love russians .
you all set ?
and then when they tell you to take the lie detector test ,
you go and you answer honestly .
about everything ?
yes .
is your first name jeff ?
yes .
did you pick the number four ?
yes .
have you ever removed confidential materials from the workplace ?
yes .
are you currently in illinois ?
yes .
and then you lay the groundwork for your defense .
what ?
do you know what froines is doing ?
huh ?
froines , our system admin ?
do you know what he &apos;s doing ?
probably nothing .
no , he &apos;s checking up on his ex @-@ wife .
he &apos;s digging her calls out of the bit bucket .
so ?
i just think it &apos;s wrong .
yeah , okay .
you know it &apos;s wrong ?
they won &apos;t think it &apos;s wrongdoing .
that &apos;s why you go to the office of the general counsel .
yes ?
and this is what you say ...
i work as an independent contractor for the nsa ,
and i want to report wrongdoing within the company .
i &apos;m sorry ?
before i go further ,
this report must remain confidential ,
and there can be no repercussions for me .
that &apos;s true .
on multiple occasions , i have observed my supervisor
monitoring his ex @-@ wife &apos;s calls and e @-@ mails .
and then it will no longer
be about your suspicious removal of the flash drive .
you removed it because you &apos;re a whistleblower .
that protects you .
and that &apos;s it ?
yep .
you go back to your workstation and you relax .
that &apos;s odd .
cary argos just mentioned the nsa .
in what context ?
i can &apos;t tell , he &apos;s in the background .
background of what ?
clarke hayden had his phone on speaker .
cary was passing by , talking to someone
and he said something about the nsa .
maybe they &apos;re suing us again .
shut up , j.
let me hear it .
you have to look for a way
to hand off non @-@ billable tasks .
look , it &apos;s the nsa .
that &apos;s the value prop ...
what ? i couldn &apos;t hear anything . turn it up .
... have to look for a way to hand off
non @-@ billable tasks .
look , it &apos;s the nsa .
that &apos;s value proposition of support staff .
that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
he just read something online or something .
jeff ?
do you have a minute ?
sure .
you said mr. froines was using surveillance facilities
to follow his ex @-@ wife ?
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re accusing me of what ?
well , thank you for meeting me .
no problem .
i don &apos;t want to be the enemy .
you &apos;re not the enemy .
good .
you &apos;re the devil .
that &apos;s why you need me .
how can you be an angel if you don &apos;t let me be the devil ?
that makes no sense .
your partner will cut some corners .
and i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not criticizing him , because
he was only doing the dirty work that you didn &apos;t want to do .
he was the one ...
uh , mr. canning ?
you &apos;re in his office , you &apos;re taking his cases .
what more do you want ?
i want your respect .
another martini .
i &apos;m not the same man i was ,
diane , i &apos;ve changed .
good for you .
you &apos;re fighting me .
it &apos;s not gonna work if you &apos;re fighting me .
said the rapist to his prey .
that &apos;s incredibly offensive .
mr. canning , you really want my respect ?
then stop playing games .
stop treating me like i &apos;m one of your marks .
just talk .
use words to communicate your needs and desires .
i want a home .
i &apos;ve been drifting , and ...
i need a place to call my own .
this is that place .
okay .
come on in . we &apos;re ready .
finn has exercised his right
to have his lawyer in the session .
and you &apos;re welcome , mrs. florrick .
i didn &apos;t realize the state &apos;s attorney
was part of the unit .
i appointed him .
good to see you , jimmy .
finn .
uh , mr. polmar and i have taken the liberty
to explain in depth any questions that you might have
about his prosecutions with the cooke county
state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
this is a summary of the evidence
and how much he worked with mr. castro on each defense .
prosecution .
prosecutions .
thank you .
and does this cover the detention order ?
excuse me ?
finn &apos;s detention orders in these cases .
we were told this was about the four prosecutions .
three prosecutions .
yes .
right . three .
this was not about jeffrey grant .
yes , but it &apos;s about the detentions in his cases .
what does this inscription here mean ?
&quot; genden . &quot;
you know what it means .
i know it usually means &quot; general detention . &quot;
transferring a defendant into the general population
with other criminals .
to encourage a defendant to accept a plea bargain .
that is standard operating procedure .
will gardner was shot and killed
by jeffrey grant .
jeffrey grant grabbed the gun because he was being
intimidated and harassed in general pop .
you put him there , finn .
he &apos;s right . i did it , i ...
i did it , i transferred him to general population .
that &apos;s why he killed will .
clarke ?
i need you to take a case for me .
which one ? finn polmar .
why ?
i &apos;m not in a position to defend him anymore .
uh , would you excuse me ?
mr. dellinger ?
i &apos;ve been suspended .
you have ? you can &apos;t be .
the system admin was in the meeting
and accused me of spying on him .
they can &apos;t be doing that .
they did .
they lowered my security status to a red badge .
and you can &apos;t be saying &quot; nsa &quot; anywhere .
it was picked up on his speaker phone .
we &apos;ve been very careful about it .
they &apos;ve assigned me a new office .
i count styrofoam cups all day !
i need to get my job back !
okay .
we &apos;ll file a discrimination suit against the nsa .
i think it &apos;s best to handle this as a common workplace issue .
how did you know that ?
how did i know what ?
how did you know that someone picked up nsa
from clarke &apos;s speakerphone ?
no , i said &quot; it could be picked up on his speakerphone . &quot;
no , you said , &quot; it was . &quot;
then i made a mistake .
hello . it &apos;s alicia .
mom ?
i need to tell you who &apos;s in our conference room right now .
what ? you can &apos;t ...
you &apos;re listening to us , aren &apos;t you ?
tell me , or i swear to god , i will say your name .
guess who &apos;s here needing a lawyer .
mom , are you all right ?
okay , okay . yes , we are .
we &apos;re listening . just hang up .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , grace .
tell us everything ... now .
he can &apos;t break confidentiality ,
or he &apos;ll be in real ... or he &apos;ll be in real trouble .
wait a minute . wait ! why us ?
it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s not personal .
of course it &apos;s personal .
there was a fisa warrant ...
but why ? what did we do ?
no , it &apos;s not what you did .
you @-@ you had a client , danny marla .
oh , dear god ! are you freaking kidding me ? !
the translator at lockhart / gardner ?
he is not a terrorist .
well , he &apos;s a terrorist sympathizer ,
and you &apos;re the wife of the governor ...
so why are you listening ?
but wait a minute .
you &apos;re listening to peter ?
it &apos;s a three @-@ hop warrant .
we &apos;re not intentionally ...
a three @-@ hop ? so it &apos;s not just us .
it &apos;s anyone we talk to and anyone they talk to ?
no .
then what ? !
it &apos;s anyone you talk to .
it &apos;s three hops from you .
get everybody off their phones !
hey , no phones . get people off their computers !
don &apos;t hit send .
use this ... and pen and paper .
hello ?
alicia , i just wanted to ...
eli , i was just on my way to your office .
oh , that &apos;s okay . this will only take a second .
no , i &apos;m on my way . i &apos;ll see you in a minute .
alicia , i was hoping to get those files
for mr. polmar &apos;s case .
no , i decided to stay on it .
can you ask robyn to get whatever she can
from the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office &apos;s correspondence ?
state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
okay , sounds good .
alicia , you didn &apos;t have to .
it was just a quick call .
you can &apos;t use your phones anymore .
what ?
you can &apos;t call me on the phone anymore .
why ?
let &apos;s go into your office .
hello .
hi .
alicia was just saying we @-@ we can &apos;t call her .
the nsa is listening to us .
how do you know this ?
i can &apos;t say , but i believe the information is good .
when did they start listening ?
before you were elected .
we discussed the ballot box investigation .
eli , if you &apos;re gonna discuss this ,
i should go . i don &apos;t want to be subpoenaed .
thank you , alicia .
do you believe it ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a lot of paranoia going around these days .
who &apos;s our newest intern ?
why ?
adam , the guy with the beard .
adam ?
would you mind if i borrow your cell phone ?
senator , peter florrick .
peter !
how are you ?
state or federal ?
federal .
i &apos;m good .
senator , the reason i &apos;m calling ,
it &apos;s about this nsa surveillance .
yeah , that bastard snowden .
the public doesn &apos;t get why it &apos;s necessary .
ah , yeah , well , i think i &apos;m with the public on this one
because i &apos;ve heard a rumor
that i &apos;ve been targeted by the nsa .
what ?
yeah . my wife and her law firm also .
no , they don &apos;t go after governors .
there &apos;s too much downside .
well , listen , bill ,
i know you &apos;re with the senate intelligence committee ,
and could you just check around for me ?
sure , i &apos;ll look into it .
great . thanks .
you think he &apos;ll tell the truth ?
no .
okay .
is there something i should know about you and alicia ?
no .
you &apos;re monosyllabic these days .
yeah .
and in the three years as his supervisor ,
have you ever given mr. dellinger a negative work evaluation ?
yes , this week .
and before that ?
no .
and was this negative evaluation this week
after he reported wrongdoing to
nsa general counsel roger garber ?
objection , your honor .
you don &apos;t have to object .
think of this more as a workplace mediation
than a court of law .
okay . i ...
disagree with the counselor &apos;s question .
an answer would violate the state secrets act .
i am not asking for any details regarding nsa programs .
my question addresses the personal retaliation
and subsequent demotion
my client suffered under mr. froines .
it concerns the content of an official meeting
between mr. froines and myself ,
which is protected by the state secrets act .
i can see how that meeting should be protected .
sustained . or , please don &apos;t ask that question .
um , mr. froines , have you ever asked my client
to monitor a specific target ?
again , state secrets , your honor .
about nsa surveillance .
okay , next question .
mr. froines ,
have you ever assigned my client to a task ?
any task ?
yes .
and was one of these tasks to monitor
the personal communications of karen froines , your ex @-@ wife ?
that is definitely state secrets , your honor .
oh , my god , is this how it &apos;s gonna be the whole entire time ?
the defense is trying an end @-@ run around state secrets .
that &apos;s enough . thank you .
find a more fruitful path , counselor .
what is your background ?
my background ? irish . why ?
anything else ?
mr. agos , anything else ?
one moment , your honor .
what are you thinking ?
let me try something .
clarke hayden , your honor .
if the nsa refuses to be forthcoming
about my client &apos;s wrongful demotion ,
we will be forced to file
a civil rights claim in federal court .
on what grounds ?
this was an act of discrimination
against a man from a protected class .
what ?
mr. dellinger , what nationality are you ?
irish , dutch and , uh , cherokee .
oh , come on . how much cherokee ?
this nation has anti @-@ discrimination laws in place
to protect citizens like my client ,
a proud descendant of the cherokee nation of ... oklahoma .
this is absurd .
that claim is an obvious pretext that
mr. dellinger will surely lose .
maybe so , but even pretextual cases
become a part of the record .
you know , the public record .
the record open to the public .
your honor , we ask for a recess .
granted .
alicia florrick .
ms. florrick , my goodness ,
you sound different .
i expect to get your secretary .
oh , no , it &apos;s just me , mr. canning , at your command .
well , i &apos;ll command , then .
uh , i was surprised to learn
that you &apos;re being sued for $ 6 million .
uh , a malpractice suit from when you worked here .
going through the files , are you ?
you &apos;d be surprised what you can find there .
i &apos;d like to make a peace offering .
lockhart / gardner &amp; canning are willing to assume
a portion of that $ 6 million liability .
in exchange for ?
lessening your firm &apos;s chumhum burden .
our burden ?
i hate to say it ,
but chumhum needs
the resources of a national firm like lg &amp; c.
mr. canning ...
what do you think of al @-@ qaeda ?
what do i think of al @-@ qaeda ?
yes .
they &apos;re a terrorist organization . why ?
i just wanted to know what louis canning thought .
hey , uh , i just got five alerts on one call .
who is it ?
someone new .
louis canning talking to alicia .
what do i think of nsa ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve always been kind of a libertarian .
强调个人主义 理性的利己主义 彻底自由放任的资本主义
ah , ayn rand and all that ?
she &apos;s an underappreciated writer . so , no , i ...
well , thank you for calling me back , senator .
no problem , peter .
i got to keep my golfing buddy happy .
tell me i &apos;m not being tapped and i &apos;ll be happy .
hey , look , i have a direct line to the offices in illinois ,
and i talked to all the people out there ,
and they say you &apos;re in the clear .
oh , good , i &apos;m relieved .
i was a little , uh , i was a little worried there .
hey , the new normal makes us all nervous . but you &apos;re good ,
and so is your wife .
well , thank you again .
mm @-@ hmm . listen , um ...
about that westgate construction site
that we were talking about on the eighth hole ,
there are a few things i wanted to settle .
a few ... uh , what ? listen , peter , i ...
the westgate construction site .
remember , we agreed to delay discussion on compensation ?
i thought we should talk about that now .
no , no , no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think ...
look , i &apos;m coming out there in a few weeks .
why don &apos;t we discuss it then , okay ?
no , no , no , i think now &apos;s a better time for me .
i think we agreed to an equal split ,
unless you &apos;ve changed your mind .
uh , peter , that was just between you and me .
and it is between you and me ...
now ... on the phone .
no , i mean , it is ...
how is the westgate district doing for you ?
peter , stop .
for me , it &apos;s ...
you &apos;ve made your point .
no , my point is i want them to stop
listening to me and my office .
i want them to stop listening to my wife &apos;s law office .
for the next five months ,
i &apos;m going to call my wife &apos;s office
twice a week to discuss the westgate construction site .
so if you don &apos;t want to be in the papers ,
i would strongly suggest that you use
your considerable influence with the nsa
to take us off any lists that we are on .
do you understand me ?
bill , do you understand me ?
it &apos;s this guy froines . chuck froines
out of the illinois office .
he &apos;s the one driving this .
get me his contact info .
it won &apos;t make a difference calling him .
let me deal with that . just get me his contact info .
i am not worthy .
i am not worthy .
your honor , my client &apos;s home was raided last night
due to the filing of a doj crimes report ...
a raid that proved fruitful , your honor .
we recovered a classified document in his desk drawer .
that wasn &apos;t classified . that was a meeting schedule .
your honor , i can &apos;t be sure ,
since i have not been given a copy of this evidence ...
implicit in the word &quot; classified &quot;
is the idea it can &apos;t be distributed .
but it is our understanding the document in question
is a meeting schedule .
that &apos;s all . it was not classified
when it was given to mr. dellinger or when he took it home .
the nsa retroactively classified it
because the raid failed to produce the evidence
they were hoping to find .
on the contrary , your honor , the raid produced
this classified document .
it wasn &apos;t classified until 12 hours ago .
this is the exact definition of ex post facto law .
your honor , i would like to call our client
to testify to the innocuous contents
of this document .
objection .
or ... whatever .
i disagree .
the classified information procedures act
prevents a criminal defendant from disclosing classified information .
then i would ask your honor to review the contents
of the document in camera .
actually , your honor ,
you don &apos;t have the necessary security clearance
to view the document .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you and mr. hayden and mr. agos
must apply for clearance
and be vetted , if we are to go forward .
i can &apos;t look at it ?
i &apos;m sorry , sir , but you cannot .
it &apos;s a list of meetings and times , your honor .
okay , then . i will apply for security clearance ,
as i assume you will as well ,
mr. hayden , mr. agos .
we will , your honor .
and when it is granted ,
we may proceed .
kalinda , can you come here for a sec ?
have a seat .
can i ask you a question ?
do you like working here ?
i do .
because i was looking at your employment record ,
and i noticed you chose not to sign the contract .
you just like being a free agent ?
don &apos;t like to be tied down ?
yeah .
but you &apos;ve been here a long time ,
so clearly you @-@ you @-@ you like it .
you must be happy ,
i mean ... certainly we pay you enough .
i am happy .
if i were unhappy , then ... i wouldn &apos;t be here .
well , there &apos;s a coincidence ,
because if i was unhappy ,
you wouldn &apos;t be here .
you can &apos;t work for diane and work for the firm .
well , diane &apos;s a managing partner .
yes , but if you work for her exclusively ,
then feed her information that i discuss with you ,
then let her pay you ...
then we &apos;ll sue you
for return of employee compensation .
hey , try me if you think i won &apos;t .
diane doesn &apos;t have the votes .
i have the votes .
you think i &apos;d be here if i didn &apos;t ?
what do you want , louis ?
i want to know what diane wants you to do .
pretend to be close to you .
find out whether you &apos;re pushing her out .
tell her i &apos;m not .
you , uh ... seem happier .
i had a good night &apos;s sleep .
mrs. florrick .
now that you &apos;ve arrived , we can begin .
i assume you &apos;ve had sufficient time
to consult with mr. polmar ?
yes , thank you .
and i have a few questions for you , mr. castro .
for me ?
yes .
by all means .
mr. castro ,
did you ever use the term &quot; genden &quot; yourself
in any text or memo to staff ?
&quot; genden &quot; meaning &quot; general detention &quot; ?
yes .
no .
it &apos;s not part of the culture of my office .
so it &apos;s not a term or practice
you yourself use ?
that &apos;s correct .
is this a cross @-@ examination of the state &apos;s attorney ?
it &apos;s okay . happy to answer .
i took the liberty of having some slides loaded .
mr. castro ,
you sent my client a text
on march 16 of this year that says ,
&quot; is jeffery grant g.d. ? &quot;
yes , i can see .
can you tell the panel
what you meant by this text ?
perhaps you overlooked the fact that you have used the term .
no . &quot; g.d. &quot; is not the term .
i see .
so what did you mean by g.d. ?
is the prosecutor sufficiently prepared
to take the defendant down to first degree ?
&quot; going down &quot; &quot;
i see . thank you for the correction .
no problem .
so in this text ,
you write , on april 6,
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to g.d. on batiste .
what fun ! &quot;
you were saying ,
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to go down on batiste .
what fun &quot; ?
no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
what i meant was i can &apos;t wait to take him down .
by going down on him ?
no . that &apos;s not ...
you @-@ you &apos;re misinterpreting my words .
sir , you used &quot; g.d. &quot; to mean &quot; general detention , &quot;
as everyone in this room well knows .
and to act as though finn polmar &apos;s behavior
is any different from your own
is simple hypocrisy .
no .
you are trying to scapegoat here ,
and that is ...
excuse me .
placing defendants
in general population
was a tactic used by the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
to soften up defendants for a plea bargain .
you know this , matan .
you used it .
so it is the height of scapegoating
to blame finn polmar for this .
and it is almost criminal
to blame him for jeffrey grant &apos;s actions .
he did what any prosecutor in this room would do .
and you know this .
well , you woke up .
didn &apos;t you ?
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s time to kick some ass .
we know what you &apos;re up to , mr. canning .
we wanted to thank you .
will was anxious to expand .
he was aggressive , and the firm purchases
that he didn &apos;t tell us about . left us vulnerable .
yeah , i bet that was , uh , quite a surprise .
how did you manage to undo the deals ?
well , the firms that will bought
both represent the third and sixth
largest pharmaceutical companies in the country .
luckily for us , i represent the largest .
so the clients conflict .
yeah . faced with the prospect of firing their biggest clients ,
uh , they were both surprisingly amenable
to reconsidering the purchases .
and the sports firm in l.a. ?
well , there &apos;s no conflict there .
i don &apos;t represent anybody in sports law . do you ?
no .
well , you do now .
it seemed like a good idea to keep them .
it &apos;s a growing field .
well , it meant a lot to will .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to help .
you know , you two are overthinking this .
this hidden agenda that you keep looking for , th ...
there isn &apos;t one .
your track record is a ...
thing that &apos;s hard to ...
get past .
that was before .
it was the old days .
i &apos;m your partner now .
i may be a scumbag , but ...
hey , i &apos;m your scumbag .
froines .
no , you have the wrong number .
yeah . how &apos;d you get this ?
no , i don &apos;t have a car for sale .
froines .
excuse me , where &apos;d you get this number ?
no , i don &apos;t have a car ...
there &apos;s been some mistake .
is your first name charles ?
yes .
are you in illinois ?
yes .
are you now a member of any group that advocates
the violent overthrow of the united states government ?
no .
have you ever been contacted by any group
that advocates the violent overthrow
of the united states government ?
no .
administrative leave ? why ? what did i do ?
probably nothing .
it &apos;s just administrative .
is this about these calls ?
what calls ?
five calls asking about a car .
i don &apos;t know anything about them .
well ... let &apos;s talk about what you do know .
nothing .
i &apos;m being pranked , that &apos;s all .
okay .
let &apos;s take the calls one at a time .
who is ... bilal al @-@ dawoodi ?
got some good news for you , mr. dellinger .
the government &apos;s dropping their case against you .
you can go back to work .
i left you a message on your cell , too .
call me back on either one .
you know , i knew it wasn &apos;t dell .
no way .
what ?
he &apos;s not coming back .
how do you know ?
shut up , j.
hans told me .

i thought hans was the leaker .
what ? where did you get that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i heard he went to reykjavik .

iceland has the hottest women of anywhere .

dearborn , michigan , 31,

than to be spying on a governor and his family , but you know ...
