sheila amanda sazs
will you marry me ?
yes , i &apos;ll marry you .
and when we have kids , world , watch out .
louis , i don &apos;t want kids .
sheila , i &apos;m gonna be a father .
mike ross is not coming back to this firm .
you heard louis . he already gave him the job .
i want to know why the hell you came back .
what matters is that i &apos;m staying
because this is where i belong .
this makes it look like forstman &apos;s payment never
went to any offshore accounts
and that you never took a piece of it .
no , that &apos;s forgery .
which is less of a crime than what you did .
i had no choice !
bullshit , you had no choice !
you could &apos;ve said no at any goddamn point along the way .
one thing is for sure .
when all this is over , i &apos;m gonna fire the shit out of you .
i wouldn &apos;t be back here if it wasn &apos;t for louis .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
dear harvey and jessica ,
i put all of you in jeopardy for my own personal gain .
effective immediately ,
i , louis litt ,
am resigning from pearson specter .
please take care of my home .
one , two .
give me a second , gimme a sec .
you &apos;re not dressed for it .
maybe we can get you some trunks , go a few rounds .
i think i &apos;ve already gone a few rounds .
i need your help .
anything . what can i do for you ?
clients . i need clients .
louis , the by @-@ laws say that--
come on , harvey . you think i don &apos;t know what they say ?
i wrote the by @-@ laws .
yeah , and who &apos;d you write &apos; em for , huh ?
jessica , and she &apos;s not gonna make an exception for you .
well , maybe she &apos;ll make one for you ?
she &apos;s not going to .
harvey , do you think i want to be here ?
i tried to get interviews at six different firms
and every one of them said the same thing :
it &apos;s a bloodbath out there .
which means if i can &apos;t bring business with me ,
i might as well move to siberia
because i &apos;m never gonna find a job in this city .
louis ...
harvey .
i &apos;m not askin &apos; for the moon .
just three companies that i brought to the firm myself
when they were nothing .
let me talk to jessica .
thank you .
harvey , you don &apos;t look busy .
would you like to attend the international securities
law symposium ?
that depends .
is it in vegas , miami , or rio ?
poughkeepsie .
send paul porter .
what can i do for you ?
i just saw louis .
no . he &apos;s not getting any clients .
he just wants three .
letting them go won &apos;t break us .
no , it won &apos;t , but it will open the floodgates for
every partner that ever thought of leaving
and taking their clients .
he &apos;s not every partner
and he &apos;s worked his fingers to the bone for both of us ,
and he &apos;s asking for a crumb .
and i give him that crumb , and next thing you know ,
all the cookies in the cabinet are gone .
you don &apos;t know that .
i do know that instead of talking about
giving louis &apos; clients away ,
you should be working on keeping your own .
jessica , i &apos;ll find a way to keep versalife ,
but that has nothing to do with louis .
we owe the man something .
and i &apos;m giving him something .
my phone rings and he gets a glowing recommendation
instead of me saying that he left after committing a felony .
no one &apos;s gonna call if he can &apos;t get in the door .
that &apos;s on him , not on me .
are you sure we should be doing this ?
you really want those vultures
in bankruptcy picking through his stuff ?
it just doesn &apos;t feel okay going through his things .
rachel , you haven &apos;t heard from him . i haven &apos;t heard from him .
if we don &apos;t pack up his stuff , who will ?
i guess you guys had the same idea i did .
yeah .
he didn &apos;t take that either ?
no .
i just cleaned it .
it was smudged and i didn &apos;t want to give it back to him dirty .
he must have been in such a hurry .
he was in a hurry &apos; cause he was ashamed .
i want to just get this over with .
jessica , what ...
am i doing here ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that i know you know the truth
about louis &apos; resignation .
i don &apos;t know--
yes , you do , and i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t like it .
you &apos;re right .
i didn &apos;t .
because i don &apos;t think that he deserves to be fired .
that &apos;s funny , because i think you both deserve to be fired .
what do you ...
you knew what he did ,
and you said nothing .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
to fire me .
no . i &apos;m here to give you a second chance .
those don &apos;t look like my case files .
they &apos;re not , but i didn &apos;t come empty @-@ handed .
i got you somethin &apos; .
a job ?
general counsel at procter &amp; gamble .
procter &amp; gamble ? what is that , a joke ?
they &apos;re in cincinnati ,
which is like , american for &quot; siberia . &quot;
it &apos;s american for &quot; number 31 on the fortune 500 , &quot;
and it &apos;s a chance to make a fresh start .
whose idea was this chance ?
her majesty ?
oh , yeah , i bet she loved that .
ship me off and never see me again .
louis , it was my idea , and you should take it .
well , would you take it ?
no way on earth .
you know why ?
because this is rome ,
you &apos;re a gladiator , and so am i.
then be a gladiator .
take this job and fight your way back here .
i don &apos;t have to go to cincinnati to fight my way back here .
i can goddamn fight jessica .
you &apos;re here to pick up your things ?
i &apos;m here to pick the three clients that are mine .
those clients , like everyone this firm represents ,
belong to me , and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
oh yes there is , &apos; cause pursuant to the by @-@ laws ,
you &apos;re required to inform clients of any attorney &apos;s departure .
if you fail to do so prior to me giving you formal notice ,
they &apos;re up for grabs .
well , you wrote the by @-@ laws .
i &apos;ll take your word that &apos;s what they say .
oh , i see . you don &apos;t think i can take &apos; em from you , huh ?
well , i &apos;m the one who brought them in
and answered their call at 4 : 00 in the morning ,
when all you did was take your cut .
is that all i did ?
yes , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna win them ,
because i deserve them .
and that &apos;s what it always is with you , louis , isn &apos;t it ?
what you deserve .
you &apos;re goddamn right it is ,
and you have some nerve tellin &apos; me no
after all i &apos;ve done for you .
what you &apos;ve done is break the law ,
and i &apos;m still willing to give you a good recommendation .
i don &apos;t need your bullshit recommendation .
i need clients , and if you &apos;re not gonna give &apos; em to me ,
you better strap in ,
because i &apos;m gonna take &apos; em .
louis .
you haven &apos;t returned any of my phone calls .
i don &apos;t like contact during transitional periods .
but you didn &apos;t even say goodbye .
what is there to say , katrina ?
well ...
when you &apos;re ready ,
i would love to take you out for dinner .
we can &apos;t do that . you &apos;re on the other side now .
what are you talking about ?
i gave jessica notice .
i &apos;m going after three clients .
louis--
no @-@ no @-@ no .
we &apos;re gonna go do battle ,
and i do not want to put you in the position
to fraternize with the enemy .
you &apos;re not the enemy , louis .
jessica had me contact all of your old clients in person .
she what ?
you can &apos;t approach them . it &apos;s over .
i have to get going .
louis !
i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t want to do it .
don &apos;t be .
if it had to be somebody , i &apos;m glad it was you .
i &apos;m in the middle of a merger .
what &apos;s so important that i had to come down
to your shitty office ?
this used to be your shitty office .
and after that , it belonged to six other people ,
five of whom are now gone .
what &apos;s your point ?
that things can change in the blink of an eye .
louis .
yes , louis .
took all of ten seconds to scrape his name off the wall .
how long do you think it &apos;s gonna take jessica to scrape off mine ?
what are you lookin &apos; for , mike ?
harvey , jessica sees me as a huge problem .
the solution is just to get rid of me .
i don &apos;t want that to happen ,
so i need to solve an even bigger problem .
and you want me to give you a bigger problem .
i just got back . i need you to give me
the biggest problem you &apos;ve got .
fine .
sterling pharmaceuticals is merging with pfizer .
come on , smart guy . you want to solve the problem ?
you better be able to identify it .
there is no problem . they merge .
they only make up 26 % of the market .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not over the limit for 10b @-@ 6 .
but ?
shit .
versalife puts us over the limit .
we have to drop them .
unless we figure out a way around 10b @-@ 6 .
like i told jessica i would .
you told her that ?
harvey , no one has ever been able to do that .
listen to me . you want to make a splash ?
part the red sea .
oh , no .
&quot; oh , no , &quot; what ?
you have that look on your face
like you want me to have some emotional conversation
i don &apos;t feel like having .
you know what , harvey ?
i just came in here to see if you needed anything .
i don &apos;t .
okay , fine .
listen , i know that this whole thing with louis
is upsetting you .
no . what &apos;s upsetting me , is you saying
you &apos;re here to see if i need anything
when you really want to talk about louis .
i &apos;m worried about him . he &apos;s in a really bad place .
you think i don &apos;t know that ? that &apos;s why i tried to help him .
i got him a job on a silver platter
and he threw it in my face .
and he shouldn &apos;t have done that .
yeah . then why are you here ?
because i still think we can help .
donna--
harvey .
you did a good thing by getting him that job .
it was the right instinct , but it was the wrong city .
yeah , i can &apos;t get him anything in new york .
i &apos;m not talking about new york .
then what the hell are you talking about ?
nice grouping .
how &apos;d you know i &apos;d be here ?
because you go mudding when you &apos;re happy ,
and you come here when you &apos;re looking to blow off steam .
well , i am blowing off steam , donna ,
and i &apos;m not finished ,
so unless you can handle a pistol ,
do me a favor please and just leave me alone .
uh , how do you ...
connecticut junior pistol championship finalist .
three years in a row .
what years ?
ask me that again and i will use this on you .
is there anything that you can &apos;t do ?
no , there isn &apos;t .
including talking harvey into getting you another job .
so where is it this time ?
cincinnati ? minneapolis ?
anchorage , alaska ?
boston .
sheila .
yes , sheila .
you got harvey to do this for me ?
i got him to give you his word he will do it ,
but after you turned down cincinnati ,
he &apos;s not gonna make the call unless you say you &apos;re on board .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t ?
donna , sheila values strength .
she &apos;s gonna see this as me coming to her
at a time of weakness .
louis ,
you go to boston with the sole purpose of being with her ,
she &apos;s gonna see that as a sign of love .
tell him to make the call .
okay , kyle , i think the question you have to ask is ,
&quot; where do i see myself in ten years , &quot;
and unfortunately , the answer is ,
&quot; not as a harvard graduate . &quot;
idiot .
louis , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to take you back .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand , the way we lef--
i don &apos;t care how we left it .
not a day has gone by that i haven &apos;t thought of you ,
and i can &apos;t hold it back anymore .
sheila , i love you ,
and i want us to be together .
louis , this is wonderful , but it &apos;s--it &apos;s--
it &apos;s just a lot to take in .
to believe that you &apos;re really ready to commit .
well , how &apos;s this for ready ?
i &apos;m taking a job in boston .
what ?
i quit pearson specter .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t believe it .
you did all that for me ?
yes .
well , i--
well , what ?
i got a job in boston for you .
louis , did you make that decision
before or after you quit your old job ?
what difference does it make ?
it makes a huge difference .
you don &apos;t call for six months , and then ...
one day you wake up , quit your job ,
and suddenly i &apos;m supposed to fill the hole in your life ?
no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no , it &apos;s not like that .
okay , then what is it ?
i mean , do you know
how hard it was for me to not call you ?
i was tryin &apos; to move on .
then why didn &apos;t you move on ?
because i realized that i don &apos;t need new york .
i need you .
louis , geography was the least of our problems .
no , i know .
and--and i want you to know that i &apos;ve come around on that .
you don &apos;t &quot; come around &quot; on children .
i don &apos;t want them , and i &apos;m not going to change my mind .
you don &apos;t have to , because i &apos;ve changed mine .
okay , and i believe that you believe that , it &apos;s--
well , then if you b--
i &apos;m just sensing that you don &apos;t know where i &apos;m--
louis , when i asked if you &apos;d quit first ,
i was asking because if--
if i believed that you were really ready
to give up children ,
i would run into your arms and never let go ,
but if you &apos;re doing this because you &apos;re down and out--
but that &apos;s just it .
do you understand that i was going to change
my entire work schedule weeks ago for you ?
before all this .
you were going to .
but you didn &apos;t .
sheila , please .
you have to understand where i &apos;m--
it was good to see you , louis .
please go .
i see frustration .
you see me getting my ass kicked
by ftc rule 10b @-@ 6 .
and ?
harvey needs an update and i don &apos;t have shit .
and if you were harvey and he was jessica ,
you &apos;d say you &apos;re all over it .
i can make that happen .
i &apos;m all over it .
good .
donna , send a bottle of johnnie walker blue
to jonathan palmer ,
and get him tickets to the next sox game ,
and then find out when his wife &apos;s birthday is ,
his kid &apos;s birthday , his dog &apos;s birthday .
how am i supposed to--
i don &apos;t care how you do it .
figure it the hell out .
harvey , this is a thank you to him .
why are you so mad at me ?
it &apos;s not a thank you , it &apos;s an apology
for you talking me into getting him to give louis a job .
what did he--
he didn &apos;t show up to the interview ,
and what &apos;s happening with our versalife problem ?
i &apos;m all over it .
yeah , &quot; all over it &quot; means you don &apos;t have dick .
next time i see you , have something .
jonathan palmer &apos;s in boston .
harvey got louis a job there
because of sheila , didn &apos;t he ?
yes .
donna , if he didn &apos;t show up for the interview ,
it means it didn &apos;t work with sheila .
shit .
he &apos;s gonna be devastated .
you bring him his box of stuff yet ?
no , but i &apos;m going to right now .
let me do it .
listen to me .
harvey &apos;s pissed at you because you don &apos;t have anything
and louis needs me .
donna , i am here because that man
put my well @-@ being before his own .
he gave up going after sheila for me .
for all i know , that &apos;s why it didn &apos;t work out for him up there ,
and it &apos;s ...
the least i can do , is comfort him when he &apos;s down .
go .
come in , come in .
what are you doin &apos; here ?
stuff has been sitting on your desk for days .
i wanted you to have it .
okay . i &apos;ll need it for my new office .
you got a job ?
not yet , but i will .
order of the coif .
yeah , look who graduated magna cum laude .
summa , actually , for all the good it &apos;ll do me .
i know there &apos;s got to be a story behind this key . yeah ?
from one of your first cases or ...
mike , do me a favor , please .
just stop it , will you ?
stop what ?
stop asking questions that you already know the answers to
just to stay here longer .
louis , i &apos;m not--
you &apos;re not what ?
examining me ? yes , you are .
you &apos;re just making small talk while you look around the room
to see if there are any sharp objects in the vicinity .
that is not why i came here .
well , it wasn &apos;t to deliver a box of my shit .
look , when i was drowning , you threw me a lifeline , okay ?
okay , well , that &apos;s nice of you to say ,
and i appreciate you bringing over my things ,
but they &apos;re not exactly a lifeline .
i heard about boston .
what &apos;d you hear ?
that harvey got you a job and you didn &apos;t even show up .
well , why would i when the love of my life
rips out my heart and then stomps on it ?
louis , i &apos;m just trying to help .
well , you can &apos;t !
i don &apos;t have sheila .
i don &apos;t have a job .
and right now i &apos;d just prefer to be alone .
no .
well , i don &apos;t care what he says .
15 % of bullshit is still bullshit .
dick .
what can i do for you , mike ?
i can see you &apos;re busy , sir , so i &apos;ll just jump right to it and--
hold it right there .
if this is your asking me for rachel &apos;s hand in marriage ,
you know , you &apos;re goin &apos; about it the wrong way .
sir , i think if i were gonna do that ,
i &apos;d have the foresight to ask your wife
how to approach you first .
good answer .
i &apos;m actually here about louis litt .
yeah , i heard he resigned .
he did , and he &apos;s looking for a job .
a fellow like that should have his pick .
well , the partnership agreement
prohibits him from taking clients .
ooh , shit . yeah .
ah , jessica doesn &apos;t play around , does she ?
she took his firstborn too ?
look , i know it &apos;s bad out there , but--
bad ? it &apos;s the apocalypse .
and i &apos;m not runnin &apos; a soup kitchen .
if a partner can &apos;t bring me clients ...
what &apos;s that ?
these are louis &apos; billables for the last 15 years .
this guy ever sleep ?
and he doesn &apos;t just bill .
he trains the associates , he publishes .
he will give his life to you .
and you want me to do this
because you &apos;re with my daughter ?
i want you to do this because i &apos;ve never asked you for a thing ,
and the first time i am ,
it &apos;s a favor for someone else .
that &apos;s the kind of man that your daughter is with .
so it &apos;s because you &apos;re with my daughter ?
you &apos;re gonna see it how you &apos;re gonna see it ,
but the real question is :
what are you gonna do about louis litt ?
i &apos;ll meet with him .
but there &apos;s no guarantee .
well , that &apos;s all i can ask .
you tell my daughter to give her old man a call sometime .
yes , sir .
you look happy .
i am happy , because today i did a good thing .
you &apos;re going to let me paint the bedroom robin &apos;s egg blue ?
i said i did a good thing .
i didn &apos;t say i did a ridiculous thing .
i got louis a job interview in new york .
what ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that &apos;s amazing !
yeah .
oh , i love you .
i &apos;m gonna fix you a drink to celebrate .
well , you should fix one for yourself too ,
because i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
what do you mean ?
i mean the interview &apos;s with your dad .
what ?
i went to your dad for louis .
what ?
it &apos;s really sweet .
but ...
let &apos;s just say
there &apos;s a reason that i didn &apos;t go to my dad
to pay for law school .
i thought you said
it was because you wanted to do it yourself .
it is , but other people don &apos;t have a problem
going to their parents
because they don &apos;t have to wait for the other shoe to drop .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s not gonna give something for nothing .
so you mean after this ,
he &apos;s gonna want something from me ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but he &apos;s gonna want something from someone .
if it gets louis a fresh start , i really don &apos;t care .
oh man .
really ?
yeah .
you got to be kiddin &apos; me .
no .
you went there too ?
every tuesday for the last five years .
oh . wednesday .
chicken parm day .
more like christmas to me .
oh , i believe it .
oh , louis .
this has been a pleasure ,
but it &apos;s time that we got down to the crux of the matter .
you want to know why i resigned .
well , i did call jessica ,
and she gave you a glowing recommendation ,
and we both know that &apos;s bullshit .
you want to know the truth .
did i say anything about the truth ?
i &apos;m just makin &apos; sure you know i know that it &apos;s bullshit .
but my truth is , i don &apos;t care why you left .
all i care about is what you &apos;re gonna take .
what ?
you take one client ,
i don &apos;t give a shit how big it is ,
and i &apos;ll make you a senior partner on the spot .
wait a second . mike ross said
that i was not required to bring business .
this isn &apos;t about business .
this is about balls .
i don &apos;t need another grinder ,
i need a lawyer who can kick a door in ,
and the door in question is pearson specter &apos;s .
you want to see if i can break my partnership agreement ?
you &apos;re damn right i do ,
because if you can &apos;t do that ,
then what the hell good are you ?
you &apos;re no different than jessica .
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
well , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
sylvia will validate you on the way out .
yeah , well ,
robert , this is new york . i take a cab .
see , that &apos;s my way of saying &quot; get the hell out . &quot;
well , how long is a little while ?
do you have any--
louis !
excuse me .
katrina , what are you doing here ?
you know what i &apos;m doing here .
this isn &apos;t your client anymore .
you &apos;re prohibited from contacting them .
i @-@ i &apos;m not here to see--
neubacher capital ?
yes , you are .
just like you &apos;re going to go see carver tech
and blackthorne simons .
how do you know that ?
because they called me .
what are they saying ?
doesn &apos;t matter what they &apos;re saying .
it &apos;s plain as day you &apos;re trying to poach them .
does jessica know ?
not yet .
but if you keep doing this , she &apos;s gonna find out .
yeah , well , let her sue me ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t have any other choice .
what are you talking about ?
robert zane offered me senior partner
if i can break the partnership agreement .
that is a major law firm in new york .
i &apos;m not gonna get a better chance than that .
louis--
look , tell jessica if you have to .
i don &apos;t want to get you in trouble , okay ?
but i just lost my job .
and i just lost the woman i love for the second time ,
all in one week .
now i have this chance to turn my life around ...
with this one client .
i &apos;m gonna take it .
louis .
you want one client , i &apos;ll give you one client .
what ? wait , no--
when you agreed to take me on ,
i swore that i would be loyal to you ,
and if i &apos;m not loyal now , then i never was .
katrina , if you do this and jessica figures it out ,
she will fire you ,
and i cannot live with that .
that won &apos;t matter if you get the job
and you take me with you .
give me the goddamn name .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you something ,
and i don &apos;t want you to overreact .
from the look on your face , i &apos;m not makin &apos; any promises .
i just got an email from louis .
he &apos;s going after versalife .
get me ray .
what are you gonna do ?
get me ray !
harvey , it was just a notification email .
you don &apos;t even know where he is !
yes , i do .
what are you talking about ?
that notification is required by the bylaws .
he &apos;s doing it at the last second .
i guarantee you he &apos;s walking in versalife &apos;s door right now .
hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
not doing , did .
i just signed versalife .
you have no right .
please , i have every right .
because when i quit ,
jessica only notified my clients ,
not yours , because she didn &apos;t think
i had enough balls to go after you head @-@ on .
that wasn &apos;t her , that was me ,
because i didn &apos;t think you would stoop this low .
oh , too bad . you exposed your flank , now you &apos;re too late .
yeah , and you can see the fear in my eyes .
excuse me .
i told you , you &apos;re too late .
to tell them an unemployed clown
just sold them a pile of bullshit ?
you mean the bullshit that you have to drop them as a client ?
the pfizer merger .
ftc rule 10b @-@ 6 .
they were not pleased that you kept them in the dark .
you are a son of a bitch .
who &apos;s the clown now ?
you &apos;re a son of a bitch .
i &apos;m only taking one client
that you &apos;re gonna have to drop anyway .
the least you could do is be a gentleman about it .
a gentleman ? i got you two jobs !
two jobs in siberia !
out of pity .
i got you those jobs out of compassion ,
just like when i fought for jessica
to not fire you in the first place .
but when i take versalife back ,
it &apos;s gonna be without any feeling for you at all .
what happened ?
i lost them , but i &apos;m gonna get &apos; em back .
what i want to know is how the hell did louis find out
that we had to drop them ?
i don &apos;t know .
people know shit .
people don &apos;t know shit .
people get told shit .
jessica , i know i wanted to throw him a bone ,
but i did not tell him .
i wasn &apos;t talkin &apos; about you .
i was talking about mike ross .
bullshit , mike didn &apos;t tell--
tell me you didn &apos;t have him working on versalife .
that doesn &apos;t mean--
i knew it .
he was working on versalife .
he owes louis for bringing him back here .
that is motive and opportunity .
you just want him gone by any means necessary .
oh , i think i have been more than clear about that .
yeah , well , try another theory ,
because mike would never do this .
oh , there are a lot of things
you never thought mike ross would do .
sell out an old man &apos;s company .
get in bed with a billionaire .
cut his boss out of a deal .
jessica--
people change , harvey .
and to top it all off ,
louis is taking versalife to robert zane .
mike ross &apos; future father @-@ in @-@ law .
why don &apos;t you think about that ?
mike , i need to know what you have on versalife .
it was me .
what was you ?
louis going after them is my fault .
what did you--
i went to robert zane
and i asked him to give louis a job .
that &apos;s it ?
you didn &apos;t tell him about versalife ?
of course not , wh-- you think i would do that ?
never mind what i think .
you went to one of our biggest competitors
and put &apos; em together with a desperate louis .
i did it because louis was desperate , all right ?
i went to see him the other day to bring him his stuff ,
it was just--
the other day ?
you &apos;re telling me when you were supposed to be helping us
keep our client ,
you were busy giving them to louis on a silver platter ?
i was , but i also figured out how to get them back .
why didn &apos;t you tell me then ?
&apos;cause i was trying to think
of a better option .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with this option ?
it involves going to walter gillis .
well , look who decided to drop by .
the man who lost me my company
and his partner who tore it to shreds .
walter , i understand how you must feel .
so , why are you here ?
because we have a proposition for you .
does it involve an apology ?
it is an apology .
you want me to buy versalife ?
we want you to buy a division of versalife .
the division that makes that drug .
they &apos;ve been working on anti @-@ addiction meds for years .
look at the results . this one works .
but it &apos;s a money @-@ loser and it &apos;s gonna take years .
they don &apos;t have the capital , the patience ,
or the will .
but you do .
and let me guess , you two are here out of the goodness
of your hearts .
you want the truth ?
he &apos;d be here whether this was for his own good or not .
for me , i &apos;m here because it gets me out of a jam .
so you can stick it to us if you want to ,
but if you do that ...
you &apos;re gonna miss the chance to save a lot of other people
just like phillip .
don &apos;t ever talk to me about phillip again .
walter--
no .
this is how all this started , with you using my son .
no , i &apos;m the one who used your son .
i used him to get control of your company ,
but everything mike did from the second he met you
was to save your company ,
because when it comes to caring about people ,
he &apos;s twice the man that i am ,
and by the way , he never gave up on you ,
and he never sold you out .
bullshit .
you &apos;re right , it is .
mike , no .
the truth is , is that i gave you my word .
i told you i would never sell you out
and then i got into bed with someone that i never should have trusted
and i lost you your company .
yes , you did .
and that company was your family .
it gave you purpose , but you still have money ,
and this is a purpose .
walter , if you don &apos;t want to do this , i get it .
but i need you to understand that the only reason
i even thought to come to you in the first place
is that i &apos;m gonna regret what i did to you
for the rest of my life .
can i come in ?
of course .
i hope you &apos;re not furious with me .
i &apos;m not mad .
you &apos;re not ?
no .
well , good .
i wanted to ... thank you
for setting up that meeting with robert zane .
i just hope you understand that if i had a choice ,
i never would have gone after versalife ,
but i had no choice .
louis , we took them back .
what ?
but you had to drop them .
not anymore .
we convinced them to sell their trial drug division .
of course . you drop a drain on their earnings ,
stock price goes right through the roof .
and their market share falls below the threshold .
but who the hell would buy it ?
walter gillis .
of course , walter gillis .
louis , listen--
mike .
you won .
you &apos;re a brilliant lawyer .
you are a brilliant lawyer .
yeah , i &apos;m a brilliant lawyer who &apos;s never gonna work again .
hey , stop .
that is not true .
look--look--look at everything that you have .
a harvard law diploma , summa cum laude ,
order of the coif .
those are the credentials of a supreme court justice .
nah , that and 2 bucks will get me a seat on the subway ,
but thank you for having the decency
to tell me in person .
louis , come on .
let me--let me--
let me stick around for a while .
we &apos;ll have--we &apos;ll have a couple of drinks .
you--you can tell me the story about that key .
mike , i know what you &apos;re tryin &apos; to do .
now &apos;s not the time .
please go .
come in .
you &apos;re not louis litt .
no , i &apos;m not . but if you &apos;re expecting him to show up ,
it &apos;s gonna be a long wait .
you here to take his spot ?
i &apos;ll give you senior partner right now .
i &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re not getting versalife .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t know who that is .
it &apos;s the company you tried to poach from me .
you seem upset .
i &apos;m not upset .
i just wanted to remind you you once told me
i was a piece of shit for using your daughter against you ,
but now you turn around and use louis against me ?
no , that &apos;s not the same .
it is to me .
i may fight with him , but he &apos;s still my family .
then why did he leave ?
that &apos;s between me and louis .
i wanted versalife ,
but it &apos;s not worth gloating over .
so why are you really here , harvey ?
i &apos;m here to ask you to take louis anyway .
and why would i do that ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re a smart man .
if you do it , i &apos;ll owe you one .
i don &apos;t need you owin &apos; me one .
why don &apos;t you take the night to think about it ?
&apos;cause if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned ,
you can never have too many favors in the bank .
you wanted to see me ?
i heard about versalife .
good work .
it wasn &apos;t you .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
you know i thought it was you .
harvey didn &apos;t tell me ,
but i didn &apos;t just fall off the turnip truck .
no , you didn &apos;t .
what ?
every damn time i think there &apos;s no upside to having you ,
you do some shit to make me think
it &apos;s actually nice to have you around .
so , we &apos;re good ?
we &apos;re good after you bill a few more hours tonight .
well , that &apos;s gonna have to wait until later ,
because i am definitely going out to celebrate .
you &apos;ve earned it .
jessica .
she did what harvey would have done for you .
jessica .
katrina .
is this about the--
i can either fire you ...
or you can resign .
the choice is yours .
you know ?
i know .
then why are you being so nice about it ?
because letting you go is enough .
and you also don &apos;t want to antagonize me ,
since i &apos;ll be working for robert zane .
you haven &apos;t heard ?
we got versalife back .
louis won &apos;t be going to zane ,
and neither will you .
i wish you luck .
you &apos;ll have my letter of resignation on your desk
in the morning .
what took you so long ?
what are you , the bathroom monitor ?
well , if i were , i &apos;d say you &apos;d gone three times in an hour .
yes , and this is our third drink .
you know they have medicine for that , right ?
you saying i &apos;m old ?
yes , but i &apos;m also saying
i know you haven &apos;t been goin &apos; to the bathroom .
all right , you want the truth ?
i &apos;ve been calling donna .
oh my god , that is so great .
you guys finally decided to take the plunge .
i wanted to know if robert zane called me back .
called you back about what ?
i asked him to hire louis anyway .
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m not .
i even told him if he did i &apos;d owe him one .
what ?
oh , i &apos;m just tryin &apos; to figure out at what point
in the last week you decided to become a pussy .
oh , so doing something nice for someone makes you a pussy ?
i didn &apos;t say that exactly .
yes , you did .
let &apos;s just go through some of the nice things
you &apos;ve done for people .
okay , you know what , harvey ?
guilty as charged .
i am nice , and if that makes me a pussy ,
then so be it .
then it &apos;s settled : you &apos;re a nice pussy .
miss , can i get a cosmo here for my friend ?
go ahead , order another drink .
just be careful , &apos; cause you &apos;re gonna
be in the bathroom in another five minutes .
you going back to the prostate again ?
what , like you &apos;ve never repeated jokes before ?
i have no idea what--
what i &apos;m talking about ?
let &apos;s see uh , &quot; you see ,
that &apos;s funny , because blah @-@ blah @-@ blah , &quot;
or &quot; by blah @-@ blah @-@ blah , i mean blah @-@ blah @-@ blah . &quot;
okay , i get it .
oh , i &apos;m just getting started .
i could do this all night .
hey , you know what ?
now i have to go to the bathroom .
go for it . take your time , no rush .
if it hurts , call someone .
louis , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m waiting for harvey .
harvey &apos;s not here .
then you &apos;ll have to do .
look , louis ,
i know you &apos;ve been through a lot ,
but harvey &apos;s gonna--
i don &apos;t give a shit what harvey &apos;s gonna do .
okay , you &apos;re scaring me .
you know what an oscar looks like ?
what ?
academy award . bald guy .
i mean , of course we all know what it looks like ,
but especially you , you &apos;re an actress .
it &apos;s the highest honor in your field .
i mean , of course you don &apos;t need to be told what it is .
what are you talking about ?
the highest academic honor in harvard law
is the order of the coif .
you don &apos;t get a trophy .
you get three things .
you get a parchment to hang on your wall ,
a medal to wear at graduation ,
and this .
now , this key doesn &apos;t say &quot; order of the coif . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t say anything .
it &apos;s just a symbol .
what does that have to do with harvey ?
it doesn &apos;t . it has to do with mike .
you know what , louis ? it &apos;s been a long day , can--
it &apos;s about to get longer .
see , mike asked me about this .
and i thought he was--
i thought he was trying to get my mind off of my problems ,
but then he did it again .
and it got me to thinking :
mike graduated magna cum laude .
he &apos;s in order of the coif .
but he didn &apos;t recognize this .
so he forgot a stupid key .
mike ross doesn &apos;t forget anything .
see , the reason he didn &apos;t recognize this
was because he never got one , because ...
he didn &apos;t go to harvard .
louis , we &apos;ve been down this road before .
mike is in the harvard database .
but he &apos;s not in the yearbook ,
and according to his credit report ,
his address during his law school years was in new york .
he even paid rent the first of the month in person .
well , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s an--
sit down !
last year , you told me not to tell sheila about mike &apos;s file .
you acted like you cared about me .
you didn &apos;t give a shit about me .
you cared about you !
and harvey !
no .
and mike !
no .
and jessica !
louis , that &apos;s not true !
well , let &apos;s call sheila right now .
i know all of the numbers by heart .
i mean , she may not be interested in me anymore ,
but she will definitely be interested in a fraud claiming
that he went to harvard .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ?
you &apos;ve been lying to me since the day mike ross arrived .
i knew harvey and jessica never really accepted me ,
but i thought you were different .
i thought you were my friend .
i am your friend , louis .
no , you &apos;re not .
and don &apos;t you ever say that to me again .
where are you going ?
to see your friend jessica .
louis knows .
louis .
i know you &apos;re a stickler for the rules ,
so i figured i &apos;d just come by to return my i.d.
you want an explanation .
i want to see you perp walked through the bullpen
with your pretty little jacket draped over your handcuffs .
but until then , yeah , i &apos;ll take an explanation .
when i found out the truth about mike ross ,
it had already been done .
by harvey ?
right after he made senior partner over me ?
that &apos;s when he hired the fraud ?
that &apos;s the correct timeline , right ?
yes .
so instead of turning him in ,
you cover it up .
louis--
and the one time that i do something ...
you don &apos;t cover it up at all .
you throw me to the wolves .
i saved you from the wolves .
then i ask you for the smallest gesture ,
just to allow my career to continue with dignity ,
and you couldn &apos;t muster the tiniest shred of compassion .
what do you want me to say ?
i want you to tell me you &apos;re a liar !
and a hypocrite !
i want you to say you &apos;re sorry .
i am a liar .
and i am a hypocrite .
but i will not say i &apos;m sorry ,
because i did what i did to protect this firm .
well , looks like the captain &apos;s about to go down with her ship .
bullshit .
you want something .
oh , i told you . i want to see you in--
in handcuffs ?
if that were true ,
the police would be here instead of you .
no , you wanted to see me squirm
before asking me for what you really want .
i &apos;m not gonna give you the satisfaction .
so you might as well spit it out .
you asked me what i wanted once before and i told you .
and then you tole me i couldn &apos;t have it .
but now i can .
