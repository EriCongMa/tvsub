we are just now getting word of a story
联调局头号通缉犯在香港抓捕归案
developing out of hong kong .
sources say authorities there have apprehended
legendary criminal raymond reddington .
雷蒙德 · 雷丁顿
he &apos;s been on the fbi &apos;s most wanted list
longer than any other fugitive ,
but tonight , sources are confirming
reddington was arrested in hong kong just hours ago .
韩国 群山市
reddington was once a rising star at the pentagon .
sources say he was being groomed for admiral when ,
雷丁顿潜逃24年
on christmas eve , 1990 , while on his way home ...
... to visit his wife and daughter , reddington vanished .
four years later , reddington resurfaced
and was charged with treason in absentia
for selling top @-@ secret american intelligence to foreign states .
from this point forward , you don &apos;t exist .
that &apos;s a load off .
just hours ago ,
the u.s. state department confirmed reddington
has been remanded into u.s. custody ,
but officials will not comment on his current location .
白令海某处
reddington &apos;s off the radar .
what do you mean ?
we don &apos;t know where reddington is ?
cia &apos;s not saying .
why not ? reddington &apos;s our asset .
only 41 people in the u.s. government know that .
i &apos;ve talked to all of them . nobody knows where he is .
he &apos;s been on the run for 25 years .
his arrest was bound to happen .
no , reddington moves too fluidly to get caught up in something
as obvious as a public assassination in hong kong .
no , he wanted this to happen .
what if he didn &apos;t ?
why would mr. reddington want to get captured ?
his arrest happened overseas .
we have to assume he wanted proximity to something .
well , if he &apos;s grabbed ,
it &apos;s either by the cia ground branch or j.s.o.c.
you think it &apos;s an intelligence apparatus that &apos;s holding him ?
scrub our sources at langley , and do it fast .
once they drop him in whatever hole he &apos;s headed for ...
he &apos;s not coming back .
202 @-@ 555 @-@ 0151 .
you speak when you &apos;re spoken to .
202 @-@ 555 @-@ 0151 .
call the number .
ask for a houseman .
call the number .
$ 50,000 will be transferred into the account of your choice .
$ 50,000 .
all i want is two minutes with your warden .
all right . we found him .
we got him .
cia analyst at langley confirmed they &apos;re holding reddington
at an off @-@ book lockdown called the factory .
that &apos;s bad news . that &apos;s really bad news .
that place is real ?
the factory ?
wait , what &apos;s the factory ?
it &apos;s a level @-@ 10 detention facility
specifically designed to process detainees
who &apos;ve been trained to withstand interrogation and torture .
assets are brought in , information is squeezed out --
data , intel , anything that may be of value .
this place is a slaughterhouse for spies .
they reduce them to ones and zeroes .
what &apos;s left is a husk that either rots away behind bars
or is executed outright .
we &apos;ve got to get him out of there .
you think the cia &apos;s gonna let us talk to him ,
just walk right in there ? no .
he &apos;s our asset .
no , they &apos;re gonna keep him all to themselves .
if he went to this factory on purpose ,
i suspect it was to make contact with somebody
he couldn &apos;t get to on the outside .
reddington gave up 25 years of freedom to see this guy .
i want to know who he is
and what intel he &apos;s got that &apos;s so damned important .
master sergeant desmond says you offered him a bribe .
care to explain ?
within 12 hours , inmate luther todd braxton
will break out of his cell .
when he does , he will steal a classified intelligence packet
that contains secrets vital to your national security .
the means for his escape and his team are already in place .
this story feels like a desperate last gasp
from a dying man .
could be .
regardless , if you don &apos;t move quickly ,
the prison will be overrun
and the dozens of innocent men and women
who operate this facility will be subdued and executed ,
beginning with you .
luther braxton is in solitary .
not for long .
he &apos;s not cooperating .
take him back to his cell . we go again in two hours .

agent cooper , kat goodson .
as you know , the director has brought me here
to liaison with your task force .
of course . we &apos;ve met -- the correspondents &apos; dinner .
you were the scotch -- neat .
please , tell us what you know .
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
the clandestine service is aware of the arrangement
your task force has with reddington .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re running point through your office .
well , then perhaps the director should &apos;ve notified me
before sending reddington to the factory .
the section chief sent a cable from the warden .
said that raymond reddington claims that a detainee ,
one luther braxton , poses a national security threat ,
and we &apos;re hoping that you can tell us something
about their connection .
i don &apos;t know .
who &apos;s luther braxton ?
braxton is a thief .
interpol &apos;s been hunting him for years .
he plans his heists to occur in the midst of chaos .
he is organized , meticulous , and he is bloody .
he stole $ 282 million from baghdad
in the middle of operation shock and awe ,
abducted a cia asset out of iran
during the &apos; 09 election protests .
later , he sold his secrets to beijing .
the cia announced his death two months ago .
we say that about a lot of the inmates at the factory .
truth is braxton &apos;s being interrogated for secrets
he stole from the chinese , from the iranians , us .
well , my money &apos;s on the fact that these two
have a history together .
reddington , braxton -- they &apos;re planning something .
whatever it is , you &apos;re going to find out .
oh , we don &apos;t have authorization .
you do now . get to reddington .
find out what he &apos;s up to .
hey , braxton , chow !
we have a code oscar , block &quot; b , &quot; dorm six !
activate critical response !
we need an emergency response team in block &quot; b &quot; now !
get away from the door ! fire one !
hands -- hands up ! get on the ground !
tell me what you know .
i tried . it &apos;s too late .
you &apos;ve lost your facility .
no , you tell me i &apos;m gonna have an escape before it happens .
now you &apos;re getting evac &apos;d out ?
why the hell am i getting evac &apos;d out ?
orders from up top .
bureau &apos;s been cleared to send a team , incoming now .
radio that chopper . tell them to turn around .
why ?
we got a problem .
what &apos;s happening here ?
e.r.f. failed .
radio the chopper .
they &apos;re sending in the riot squad .
get him to the evac team !
radio the chopper !
back up , back up !
inmate number 2532 , xavier chavez .
i know this name .
he was a court @-@ martialed special operator out of fort carson .
we got kun phan , a.k.a. &quot; cambodian carl . &quot;
did 10 years in u.s.p. florence
for hacking u.s. missile defense agency .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m counting three , five , maybe more guys
who &apos;ve all been processed into this facility
within the last three months .
got a munitions expert , special forces .
i &apos;m counting eight guys here--
khalid sankar , yemeni medic ;
jonah rodriguez , ex @-@ marine ;
and cyrus choy --
he &apos;s a red pole enforcer out of taiwan .
he &apos;s got an entire team in place .
what the hell is he doing ?
go !
let &apos;s go !
sir ?
nest command to a.c.r. , block &quot; b &quot; has been breached !
we need tactical reinforcement to the nest !
sir , we just lost video !
camera two is down !
got to turn you back !
we &apos;re in a full @-@ facility lockdown !
we &apos;ve had a breach !
detainee has taken --
easy !
desmond to deck command ,
prisoner for transport , come back .
that $ 50,000 is still on the table , desmond .
it &apos;s yours for the taking .
all you got to do is help me to help you stay alive .
you sure about this ?
do it .
eagle , eagle , this is major .
we have a breach alert . please authenticate .
eagle , eagle , this is major .
we have a breach alert . please authenticate .
the eagle &apos;s dead .
identify yourself .
i &apos;m the man who just took over your gulag ,
and you &apos;re a desk jockey that &apos;s gonna put me in touch
with somebody who matters -- clear ?
samar ?
ressler , i can &apos;t put any weight on my foot .
horrible , isn &apos;t it -- this room --
this is where all the prisoners come to die .
after you break their minds .
they &apos;re led here like cattle for you to slaughter .
when they put down your rebellion , pal ,
you &apos;re gonna take my place up here , i swear .
get on your feet ! get your feet !
get on your feet ! get on your feet !
stay ! get on your feet !
sir ! uh , sir , we have a situation .
uh , we &apos;ve lost contact with agent keen .
what about ressler ? navabi ?
uh , nothing since after they touched down .
i reached out to lanley . the entire facility is dark .
we &apos;ve got braxton .
the cia &apos;s patching him through .
this is agent rosenberg . he &apos;s our hostage negotiator .
tread lightly , agent rosenberg .
those are my people inside there .
understood , and they &apos;re gonna be fine .
we &apos;re gonna take our time , hear what he has to say ,
and get everyone out alive . you ready ?
mr. braxton , this is agent phillip rosenberg .
the director of ncs has instructed me
to open a dialogue with you .
we &apos;re not having a dialogue .
i &apos;m here to listen , but first ,
i just need to talk to the warden .
i just need to make sure that he &apos;s okay
and can confirm the hostages are okay .
no , you are a water boy ,
a bureaucrat with a stack of cue cards .
just need to talk to the warden .
of course you do -- protocol .
i have him right here .
this is warden mills .
mr. mills , everyone &apos;s okay ?
some casualties , but all accounted for .
that &apos;s terrific . glad to hear your voice .
see that , mr. braxton ?
i just wanted to talk to the warden .
mr. mills ?
warden ?
mr. mills ?
i &apos;m done talking to you , mr. rosenberg .
i want to speak to somebody with real authority .
this is harold cooper , assistant director for the fbi .
hello , harold cooper .
i &apos;m pretty sure you see how this works .
i get what i need , or somebody dies .
from here on forward ...
i am the warden .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i came to help get you out .
you came out of curiosity .
or maybe i actually care about what happens to you .
your government is being robbed .
from here ? how ?
what &apos;s he after ?
the fulcrum .
i don &apos;t know what that is . the fulcrum -- what is that ?
it &apos;s a blackmail file -- proof of the existence
of an extraordinarily powerful clandestine organization .
if their activities were made public ,
some of the most powerful and influential men
would go to prison or be executed .
and it &apos;s here , this fulcrum ?
no , the fulcrum isn &apos;t here ,
but i believe information critical to finding it is ,
and that &apos;s what braxton wants .
i &apos;m here to stop it .
i can help you .
no , you need to leave .
ressler and samar have been taken hostage .
they shouldn &apos;t even be here .
you never should &apos;ve come here .
why didn &apos;t you come to us ?
what aren &apos;t you telling me ? why don &apos;t you want me here ?
i &apos;ll get to ressler and samar as soon as i can ,
but you need to get back on that chopper .
not without ressler and samar or you .
now , how are we gonna stop braxton ?
he has an entire team .
well , sadly , there isn &apos;t a prison on earth
where i don &apos;t know a few guys .
if braxton wants to access the secrets they beat out of us ,
he &apos;s gonna need to get into the server ,
which is only accessible from the nest .
how about during a lockdown ?
this facility &apos;s like a submarine .
it &apos;s compartmentalized .
it can only be shut down by sections .
the security protocols render the entire server room
completely inaccessible .
how the hell do you know that ? i didn &apos;t know that .
khan has broken out of seven prisons .
this will be eight .
this server room -- where is it ?
northwest quadrant , basement .
we can &apos;t get you inside , but the german -- he has an idea .
who is she ?
who is this girl ?
she &apos;s with me .
your idea ?
the boiler room .
it &apos;s located next to the server room .
if you could get there , you could reprogram it to overload .
the pressure would cause an explosion .
that would blow up the server room ?
if you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;ll take out the server room .
if you &apos;re unlucky , the whole prison craters .
you said , &quot; if you could get there . &quot;
yes , the only way into the boiler room undetected
is through a single air duct ...
that &apos;s less than 24 inches square .
looks like i &apos;m the tunnel rat .
all right .
khan will guide you to the boiler room .
gernert and i will be waiting for you to let us in ,
then you &apos;ll reprogram the system .
good .
what about me ? what &apos;s my job ?
you don &apos;t have a job .
you &apos;re here because of what your cartel did
to felix moralez and my people in reynosa .
okay . shall we go to work ?
braxton , you need to see this .
i &apos;m sorry . the warden can &apos;t get to the phone right now .
may i please take a message ?
nothing ?
not a &quot; hello , how are you ? &quot;
say something , luther .
reddington .
that &apos;s me .
you &apos;re locked out , red .
i have complete control over this hellhole .
i &apos;m confident you &apos;ve got a plan
for every imaginable scenario ,
but it &apos;s the scenarios you can &apos;t imagine
that bite you in the ass , luther ,
like me , here .
do you think this is something that snuck up on me ?
after belgrade ?
belgrade .
boy , things got nasty in belgrade , didn &apos;t they ?
it &apos;s funny -- up until then , i was aimless ,
just an ordinary thief , but after belgrade ,
i became known as the man who bested the great ray reddington .
you didn &apos;t best me , luther .
you butchered and clawed your way into my pockets ,
and innocent people died in the process .
you &apos;re such a snob , red .
always considered yourself above the fray
with your handmade suits and your fancy wine ,
your private jets .
do you even drive ?
you got everybody convinced you &apos;re so hard , red ,
but i know better .
you &apos;re soft .
you &apos;re not getting the fulcrum .
and how you gonna stop me , red ?
bore me to death with beethoven ?
put me to sleep quoting nietzsche ?
come on .
we both know that in order to stop me ,
you got to have balls .
you got to run the gauntlet .
and after belgrade , well ...
... that &apos;s just not gonna happen .
so , tell me -- how are you gonna stop me , red ?
a wise man can learn more from a foolish question
than a fool can learn from a wise answer .
was that nietzsche ?
no .
bruce lee .
this man has an abdominal wound .
he &apos;s going to die .
let him down .
damn it , let him down !
okay , harold , let &apos;s test your reflexes .
this entire facility has been put into lockdown
meaning that all existing codes that ran this prison
have been invalidated .
we &apos;re aware of that .
good , then you must also be aware that one single code
has been generated by the mainframe --
a master code giving the c.i.a. and any rescue units all access .
i want it .
understood .
i can get my people working on that right away .
okay .
your reflexes , harold ...
shabby .
mine , however ...
lightning quick .
you just cost an innocent woman her life ,
which means we &apos;ll just have to go get ourselves another one .
let me set the scene for you ,
just like them old radio dramas
your granny used to listen to .
i &apos;m standing in front of a tall , fit ...
very attractive persian girl by the name of ...
samar navabi .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with her .
anyway , miss navabi has a noose around her neck ...
her very long , lovely neck ,
which is about to get a lot longer
unless you give me the code .
i &apos;ll give you 10 minutes .
we &apos;re gonna give the code , right ?
sir , i &apos;m sorry , but you have to give the code .
it &apos;s a black site . nobody will know we &apos;re negotiating .
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
we &apos;re gonna give the code !
i am not allowing that maniac to lynch one of my agents .
you can &apos;t give him the code .
you know the protocol .
the minute that the negotiator got here ,
he gave me all the relevant details on the factory ,
including the master code .
why wouldn &apos;t i give it to him ?
braxton doesn &apos;t want the code to break out of prison .
he wants it to break into our network .
what network ?
the factory isn &apos;t just a black site .
it &apos;s a level @-@ six intelligence node .
it communicates directly with langley ,
the pentagon , the white house sit room .
the intel being squeezed out of these targets ,
our highest @-@ level targets , is mission @-@ critical .
we needed our interrogators and our operatives in the field
working together in real time , so we removed any latency
between the time we received a lead
and our ability to act on it .
you put an access point
to the country &apos;s most sensitive data in a prison ...
with the country &apos;s most dangerous enemies ?
yes .
which is why i am asking you -- do not release that code .
sir , braxton &apos;s back online .
cooper .
the code .
if i give it to you , what assurance do i have
that no hostages will be harmed ?
none .
the code .
you hear that sound , harold ?
that &apos;s the sound of agent navabi &apos;s neck being broken .
please . stop .
the code !
dallas , foxtrot , one , charlie , three , seven , two .
now let --
braxton ?
braxton , respond !
we &apos;re ready here .
good . get to the server room .
i &apos;ll radio you once the system &apos;s back online .
where are we ?
i have attacked this from every angle .
once braxton reboots the servers on his end ,
he &apos;ll have full access to the intelligence network .
how do we lock him out ?
we can &apos;t , not without flipping the switch
on the entire network ,
and braxton knows we won &apos;t do that .
what would that entail ?
our d.o.d. satellites shutting down ...
a temporary loss of real @-@ time field communications .
so , centcom would go dark .
and assuming we could even get authorization to do that ,
it would take hours to shut it down .
hey , once you make that last turn ,
it &apos;s gonna be about 10 more feet .
gonna see a vent there going down .
yeah , i think i see it . i &apos;m here .
follow that , and you &apos;re in .
braxton , we &apos;re in .
dallas , foxtrot , one , charlie , three , seven , two .
you all right ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
uh @-@ huh .
have you ever heard of bruno ashmanskis ?
the most skilled cat burglar
i &apos;ve ever had the pleasure of working with .
bruno mostly did jobs on commission ,
but he always wanted to do something for himself ,
something special , so he got it into his head
that he was gonna break into the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge
to steal an imperial vase
from the qing dynasty worth millions --
the single biggest trophy of his career .
what happened ?
i never heard from him again .
i &apos;d always assumed he &apos;d succeeded ,
that he was sipping some umbrella @-@ clad cocktail
on a beach in tahiti ,
until five years later
during a remodel of the fitzwilliam ,
they removed a wall .
there was poor bruno ,
what was left of him , anyway ...
stuck inside a heating duct , still clutching that vase .
i prefer to think of old bruno on that beach in tahiti .
we have a problem .
what ?
our asset is tracking the extent of the breach .
it appears that braxton &apos;s team
has penetrated your country &apos;s network .
do we have confirmation on what it is they &apos;re looking for ?
yes , we do . the fulcrum .
so reddington does not have it .
i never believed he did , actually ,
and his efforts to stop braxton only confirmed my suspicions .
what &apos;s our collateral exposure ?
honestly ? none .
we are mirroring braxton &apos;s search algorithms ,
and if the fulcrum comes into play , we will find it .
so , mr. braxton is a liability ?
oh , yes , and mr. reddington may no longer be a threat .
we haven &apos;t touched him
for fear that he &apos;d use the fulcrum as a ...
well , to expose us , but he &apos;s bluffing .
you can &apos;t be sure of that .
alan fitch did not think so .
whether he is or not , it &apos;s a moot point .
he needs to be eliminated .
this prison of yours , the factory ,
i understand the american public is unaware of its existence .
perhaps they would not notice if it were to ...
disappear .
how much longer ?
we &apos;ve had a setback .
gernert is working on alternatives .
i &apos;m telling you ... there are no other options .
this model has redundant computerized safeguards .
if i attempt to over @-@ pressurize the boiler tank ,
those safeguards kick in automatically .
there &apos;s nothing you can do to override it ?
it would have to be done manually .
that means someone standing here ,
resetting those pressure @-@ relief valves every 90 seconds ,
while someone else mans the temperature controls
until this pressure cooker hits 700 psi . ,
and that is not gonna be me .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
yeah , i am .
because whoever stays here to do this manually
is gonna be blown into a million pieces .
or just one .
wait . you shoot him , they &apos;ll hear .
they &apos;ll be here within 60 seconds , and then what ?
we can do this , you and i.
after the pressure reaches 700,
how long do we have until it explodes ?
anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds ,
but there &apos;s no way to know for sure .
you &apos;re better off walking away now .
look , red , you know that after delhi ,
i &apos;d do anything for you , but the truth is ,
you &apos;d be lucky to get off this rig ,
and whatever your plan is , i &apos;m not a part of it .
i &apos;ve helped you . i &apos;ve done my piece .
way i see it , we &apos;re even for delhi .
we can do this .
if we don &apos;t stop this ,
the death toll isn &apos;t going to be in the dozens ,
it &apos;s gonna be in the thousands ,
and the world is gonna look quite different ...
with braxton in control of all our servers .
every operative , every analyst ,
every case officer in his pocket .
and mr. cooper has given him the keys to our kingdom .
we have to make sure he never has the chance to use them .
we have federal agents on site .
buy me more time .
let me activate an extraction team .
no .
no , just order the strike .
yes , sir .
i &apos;ll have planes in the air within the hour .
the target will be destroyed .
sir , you got to see this .
i just got confirmation that two f @-@ 22s
were scrambled out of wright @-@ patterson .
they seem to headed toward the factory .
e.t.a. to target ?
24 minutes .
get kat goodson ... now .
braxton , accessing information now .
one .
two .
three .
650 psi .
a few more , and the boiler blows .
so , when are you gonna tell me the truth ?
what truth ?
about why you came here --
the blackmail file , the fulcrum .
i can &apos;t allow braxton to get it .
why ? what difference does it make to you
if he gets it and exposes this ...
cabal ?
the group believes i have it .
it &apos;s one of the reasons i &apos;m still alive .
so , if braxton gets it ,
they &apos;ll know you don &apos;t have it ,
and they &apos;ll kill you -- is that it ?
what &apos;s the number ?
680 .
so that &apos;s what this is about -- this whole thing ?
protecting yourself ?
it may be hard for you to imagine ,
but i once had a relatively normal life --
bills to pay , playdates ,
family , some friends , people to care about .
lost all that .
lost how ?
in mexico , there are these fish
that have colonized the freshwater caves
along sierra del abra .
they were lost .
they found themselves living in complete darkness .
but they didn &apos;t die .
instead , they thrived .
they adapted .
they lost their pigmentation , their sight ,
eventually even their eyes .
with survival , they became ... hideous .
i &apos;ve rarely thought about what i once ... was .
but i wonder ...
if a ray of light were to make it into the cave ,
would i be able to see it ?
or feel it ?
would i ... gravitate to its warmth ?
and if i did , would i become ...
... less hideous ?
i didn &apos;t want you to come here , follow me here .
because the truth is if i don &apos;t stop braxton ,
what he &apos;ll discover
is that he can &apos;t get the fulcrum without you .
what does that mean , &quot; without me &quot; ?
get out of here !
what the hell is that ?
we &apos;re offline .
get down to the server room , see what &apos;s going on .
red ?
reddington ? !
breathe !
oh , my god .
red , breathe .
breathe , you son of a bitch !
down here -- the boiler room !
take her to braxton .
paper @-@ dog , we are 10 @-@ zero minutes from primary target .
requesting authorization to arm and engage .
you can &apos;t let this happen .
don &apos;t put this on me . you gave up that code .
you have three federal agents
and at least 40 innocent hostages in that facility .
inmates included , over a hundred lives will be lost .
i don &apos;t agree with this course of action ,
but i understand it .
we &apos;re doing damage control
because you couldn &apos;t make the tough call .
we don &apos;t even know what braxton &apos;s after .
what the hell is so important in that database
that someone wants to kill all those people
on the chance that he might get it ?
if you think i &apos;m just gonna roll with this , you &apos;re wrong .
what are you gonna do ? go to the post ? the times ?
this whole operation is deep black . it doesn &apos;t exist .
every trace will be incinerated
the moment reddington &apos;s a confirmed kill .
you know what happens to whistle @-@ blowers --
kooks , paranoid freaks .
you &apos;ll be a keynote speaker
in their next woo @-@ woo convention ,
and your people will be just as dead .
reddington , get up .
you got to get up ! red !
where is she ?
where is she ?
who the hell are you ?
the server &apos;s gone .
she blew it up .
carl is dead and so are the others .
get beck and wolcott on it .
you don &apos;t understand . the prisoners are loose .
and if they find out we have a chopper en route ,
we &apos;re gonna have a real problem . we need to go now .
where &apos;s reddington ?
he &apos;s dead .
i count at least a dozen cells destroyed .
we &apos;ve got inmates in the southeast quad .
you seem like a decent guy , desmond .
you should do something else for a living .
i just told you the animals are loose .
you can &apos;t get to the nest without going through them .
they &apos;re gonna kill you out there ! what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna get her back .
i &apos;m talking to you !
i &apos;m gonna need that shotgun .
it &apos;s over . the server &apos;s destroyed .
sir , we got reports of gunfire in the north hall .
now i can &apos;t raise anyone on the comms .
reddington .
head him off .
get the chopper . let youself handle the hostages .
paper @-@ dog , e.t.a. two minutes .
making final approach to target .
all this , luther , and you don &apos;t even know
what the hell you &apos;re looking for .
i know what it &apos;s worth .
it &apos;s not what you think .
it &apos;s not a golden ticket . it &apos;s a target on your back .
i know all the stories , red .
i know where it was 20 years ago ,
and i know when it disappeared .
i know about the house , the fire , the girl .
sir , i just got word .
the missiles have been launched .
impact in 30 seconds .
no wonder you came for her .
she was there that night , wasn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s the one ?
shoot him .
shoot him !
