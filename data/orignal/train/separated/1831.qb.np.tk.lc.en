i have an 18 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
i &apos;m having a baby , and , um ,
i don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
dr.bailey , have you seen the chief ?
there &apos;s something wrong with his emergency chole patient .
you may have accidentally clipped the common bile duct .
that &apos;s one of the most serious mistakes a general surgeon can make .
have you told anyone what you saw ?
have you told derek ? um ...
no .
i have loved you forever .
i &apos;m in love with christina .
we assume the really serious changes in our lives
happen slowly ...
over time .
but it &apos;s not true .
the big stuff happens in an instant .
you &apos;re up early .
yeah , i want to , uh , get some stuff done
so that i can meet the chief this afternoon .
he &apos;s gonna show me another old surgery tape .
again ? every night this week .
i thought last night was the last time .
he got held up . he couldn &apos;t make it .
yeah , i went by his office on my way out .
he was sound asleep on his couch .
which is why he couldn &apos;t make it .
i think maybe he just doesn &apos;t sleep well at home
with adele gone .
i need something from you .
well ... that , too .
i need you to give sloan an ultrasound today .
it &apos;s been almost three weeks .
can &apos;t someone from o.b. do it ?
yeah . but ...
she likes you .
all the sloans do .
hey , do we have any more-- oh ! ew !
whoa . sloan !
becoming an adult ,
becoming a parent , becoming a doctor--
one minute you &apos;re not , and the next ...
sloan .
you are .
sorry about that .
whatever . there &apos;s no more cereal .
why are you sorry ?
she &apos;s the one who didn &apos;t knock before she came in .
i &apos;ll get some cereal this afternoon .
how about some juice ?
uh , lexie &apos;s gonna give you an ultrasound today .
why don &apos;t you pick up some breakfast at the hospital ?
it &apos;s gonna be more .
you need some for lunch , too ?
yeah , yeah .
i &apos;m gonna shower .
oh , can you hold on a minute ?
i &apos;m probably gonna have to hurl this .
sloan sloan monopolizing your bathroom again ?
yeah . yours ?
owen &apos;s mine .
oh , god .
they &apos;re in there .
yeah , you should knock first .
i &apos;m late . okay ? my hair is dirty .
and he just gave her 80 bucks for a muffin and a sandwich .
that &apos;s quite a sandwich .
she &apos;s just gonna end up spending it
on a pair of jeans that show off her butt crack ,
and then she &apos;s gonna ask me for half of my pasta salad .
you sound like my mother .
um , knock much ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , there &apos;s no more hot water .
ask any doctor , and they can point
to the one moment they became physician .
it usually isn &apos;t med school graduation day .
yang ... you &apos;re going solo today .
uh , been there .
cardio solo .
whatever it is ...
valve replacement .
nobody forgets it .
uh , porcine or ...
mechanical .
so i can try out the subannular stitches .
well , i didn &apos;t teach it to you so you could crochet .
okay , thank you .
oh , my god .
what ? what ?
uh ... altman &apos;s letting her go solo on a valve .
wow . uh , you feel ready ?
she &apos;s ready . she just needs to breathe .
i am breathing .
i am a living , breathing cardiothoracic surgeon
as of right now .
i have to go prep .
sometimes you don &apos;t even know anything &apos;s changed .
you think you &apos;re still you
and your life is still your life ,
but you wake up day and look around ,
and you don &apos;t recognize anything ...
not anything at all .
一瞬
hey , do you have any cash ?
i lost the headset to my phone .
how about you hold the phone up to your ear ?
you were the one that was bitching at me last night
for being on the phone so late .
maybe if i had a headset ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to talk so loud .
maybe if you had your own apartment ,
you could talk whenever you want ,
but we &apos;re all making compromises .
okay , here &apos;s the head .
it looks like alien .
well , it &apos;s gonna be a very cute alien .
a boy alien or girl ?
dude , does it have a thing or not ?
no , i &apos;m not looking at the sex .
um , i don &apos;t ...
you ... i--i &apos;m new at this . i &apos;m--i &apos;m not very good .
so , um , why don &apos;t we go upstairs to--
there &apos;s a better machine upstairs .
uh , maybe we &apos;ll have someone else take a look .
adamson , you &apos;re with me .
meredith , you &apos;re with bailey . karev , you &apos;re with torres .
tom kates is in this ambulance .
the quarterback ?
yeah .
if you see photographers , call security .
tell your interns no autographs , no pictures .
i see anyone pull out a camera phone ,
it &apos;s going in the toilet .
so there are three of us on one patient ?
oh , come on . he &apos;s a high @-@ profile patient .
he gets a lot of attention .
i thought we agreed to stop meeting like this ?
hey , what can i say , man ? i missed your smiling face .
good to see you .
head trauma ,
but g.c.s. 15 since regaining consciousness .
he got high / lowed by a couple of their linebackers .
dropped like a rock .
okay , get x @-@ ray in here for a trauma series .
tenderness in the upper left quadrant .
i &apos;m gonna need a c.t.
got it . oh , there &apos;s pain and crepitance in the knee .
uh , get an x @-@ ray of the left knee with the trauma series .
yeah .
i saw that hit . that was a bad hit .
i @-@ i knew it the minute i saw it .
i knew before you even hit the ground ,
that was bad .
hey , hi , sweetheart .
oh , and that &apos;s my boy .
oh , he &apos;s very cute .
dr. shepherd
he &apos;s gonna be fine . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
now i can &apos;t have you in here with the baby , okay ?
okay , um , littlest high @-@ five in the world .
hey , we &apos;ll come and find you
the second we know what &apos;s going on .
i love you , babe .
don &apos;t give him too much morphine .
it makes him goofy .
won &apos;t , i won &apos;t .
how great is that kid , huh ?
he &apos;s pretty great .
did you tell sloan to move out ?
no . not that it &apos;s a bad idea , but ...
you &apos;re making her feel like crap .
she said you wouldn &apos;t even be
alone in a room with her .
no , that--that &apos;s not--
then why do i have to chaperone the ultrasound ?
because there &apos;s something wrong with the baby .
see right there on the left thigh .
yeah . on his other ankle , too .
wait . it &apos;s a boy ?
i hadn &apos;t gotten that far .
oh ! oh , sorry . congratulations .
uh , there &apos;s a lot of swelling on the right foot .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s very constricted .
what the hell aer you talking about ?
well , the baby &apos;s got strands
of amniotic tissue wrapped around his legs .
they &apos;re called amniotic bands .
there &apos;s a danger of them compromising one of his limbs .
so what ? one of his legs is gonna , like , fall off ?
that &apos;s the worst @-@ case scenario .
he &apos;s gonna have stumps ?
we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re dealing with yet .
whatever it is , we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
i can &apos;t have a stumpy baby . can &apos;t you fix it ?
um , i don &apos;t know . you know ,
i have an idea .
how about we don &apos;t answer any patient questions
with the phrase , &quot; um , i don &apos;t know &quot; ?
we &apos;re gonna fix it . uh , let &apos;s , uh , get a fetal m.r.i.
you know , i &apos;m not sure that i would recommend ...
i wasn &apos;t talking to you . you &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll be right back .
get me addison montgomery .
i adore you .
i was in the middle of breakfast .
uh , she had an m.r.i. right &apos;s worse than the left ...
i just need to say it once .
go ahead .
grandpa . grandpa , grandpa , grandpa .
oh , okay . that was four times .
is it out of your system ?
i don &apos;t know .
look at that . he thinks he &apos;s got an opening behind martin ,
and then-- ooh ! ouch .
back that up again .
okay , i would never ask for an autograph ,
but if he signed a consent form
and there was a copy laying around
torres .
what ? big fan .
what ?
oh , hey !
look who &apos;s here .
hi . did you get lost on the freeway ?
good to see you .
good to see you .
sloan &apos;s got a little something going on with the baby .
oh , is she okay ?
we &apos;ll figure it out .
i &apos;m gonna go see if they &apos;re ready .
okay .
you know how long i &apos;ve been waiting for that ?
what , you pull out his blood with leeches ?
uh , she &apos;s perkier than usual .
well , divorce will do that to you .
ah , sad .
no , she &apos;ll move on and be happy .
yeah . she just needs somebody to move on to .
well , that can &apos;t be so hard .
hey , wait . what about you ? can &apos;t you find her someone ?
that guy from oncology ,
the cute one , isn &apos;t he still here ?
this is not my area .
he used to play basketball with him .
dave
torres should do it . they &apos;re friends .
oh , she thinks i &apos;m loopy.- you are loopy .
okay , come on . it &apos;s bailey . she &apos;s lonely .
i ...
he needs a transfusion .
that splenic lac is bleeding more than i thought .
all right . we &apos;ll take a look at the c.t.s
and come up with a , uh , game plan .
all set .
ah . okay . i &apos;m coming with you .
you know dave from oncology ?
single .
you wouldn &apos;t be starting a conversation about my personal life , would you ?
bad idea ? he &apos;s handsome .
bad idea .
okay . i tried .
hi , ruthie . this is dr. yang .
she &apos;ll be performing your surgery today .
she is the best of the best . you &apos;re gonna like her .
oh , good . i am so glad to meet you .
hi .
um , i have a couple things i want to discuss . oh .
is that--can i ...
of course , of course .
um , i have allergies . mm @-@ hmm .
i @-@ i know they write them in the chart ,
but i find that if you don &apos;t tell everyone ,
you know , it kind of gets lost in the shuffle .
yeah .
aspirin , ibuprofen , bananas , zucchini ,
all forms of squash .
and pumpkin is a squash , right ?
mm @-@ hmm . people forget that . latex , dust mites .
y-- uh , i asked the nurse with the red hair
for a new pillow ,
and , um ... i would also love to get a new nurse .
because i think the redhair just brought back
the old pillow with a new case , and it &apos;s ,
you know ... it &apos;s making me sneezy .
and i &apos;m supposed to get a mechanical valve . mm @-@ hmm .
but i &apos;ve been thinking about the clicking noise
they say the mechanical valve makes ...
i mean , that--that would be irritating , right ?
don &apos;t you think that might just make you nuts ?
i &apos;m sorry , but , uh , a different valve
is a whole different procedure .
yes , but i @-@ i think the pig is a better idea--the pig valve .
you know , it &apos;s organic , right ? and they say they &apos;re very clean .
you know , all that business about ,
&quot; oh , you &apos;re such a pig , &quot; right ? that &apos;s just bad marketing .
oh , and this , uh , blanket .. this has a smell .
yeah , it does . it does smell .
like , a @-@ a--i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not clean . it &apos;s like a--
a chemical of some kind , it &apos;s chaffing .
can you see my rash ?
as the legs continue to grow ,
the bands will cut off his circulation .
if we wait , we risk severe damage to the left leg ,
possible loss of the right entirely .
but if we operate--22 weeks , it &apos;s--it &apos;s still risky .
but if you don &apos;t operate , you &apos;re not gonna kill the baby .
we can rehabilitate the remaining part of his leg
after he &apos;s born , and we can fit him with a prosthesis .
it &apos;s entirely possible that he &apos;ll walk .
oh , my god .
honey , we &apos;ve got options here .
if we operate , dr.montgomery can remove the bands ,
he &apos;ll be just fine .
or we can wait a few weeks till he &apos;s bigger and stronger ,
and we know the surgery is less risky .
well , which one of you did he sleep with ?
oh , not me .
you told her ?
she &apos;s my kid . we were bonding .
that is not how you bond with children .
i &apos;m still getting the hang of it .
so you &apos;re sure that he didn &apos;t , like , knock you up
and leave you with a child
to raise on your own or something ?
you &apos;re not just , like , really pissed
and you &apos;re trying to get revenge ?
no . no .
it--it was a long time ago , okay ?
the fact is , mark--
your father-- is--is a good guy ,
and i think you &apos;re a good kid , and i &apos;m gonna do
everything i can to help you with your baby .
okay , well , let &apos;s just get these things off his legs right now .
i &apos;ll book an o.r.
stupid quarterback only has a concussion .
tragic .
i know .
i &apos;m on his ortho stuff .
there &apos;s bound to be a surgery in there .
you want to share ?
why would i do that ?
&apos;cause you like me .
not that much .
oh , sure you do . come on .
let me scrub in ,
and i will take you out for drinks afterwards
and , you know ...
really ?
okay .
what ?
let me take you out for drinks and , you know ?
what &apos;s &quot; you know &quot; ?
whatever .
it &apos;s sex .
charlie , get over it .
you &apos;re trading sex for surgery that &apos;s prostitution .
is that the part i &apos;m supposed to get over ?
are you calling me a whore ?
explain what &quot; you know &quot; means .
i &apos;m messing with him . karev knows it , and i know it .
he &apos;s gonna want to collect .
charlie ... go find something else to worry about .
dr. bailey ...
this is , uh , dr. stanton from radiology .
rob , miranda .
rob was looking over tom &apos;s c.t. ,
and i thought he should talk to you .
oh , okay .
rob &apos;s new here , so i thought you might give him
a tour of the hospital while you discuss the c.t.
excuse me .
what are you doing ?
you spent christmas with me and meredith .
that can &apos;t be what you want .
true , but i do have a patient
that i have to do a follow @-@ up on right now .
so i don &apos;t have time to take anybody
i can do that .
follow @-@ up &apos;s easy . i can do that .
have fun . take care .
okay , have a good tour .
you want to show me the scan ?
um , how about we , uh , look at it over lunch ?
i &apos;m in the middle of a divorce .
people call me the nazi ,
and it &apos;s not because of my ice blue eyes .
i spend 12 hours a day carving people up , and i like it .
i have a child , and i have no room for casual anything .
i &apos;m angry all of the time and deeply confused
because a lot of people in my life have let me down recently .
one of them was me .
it &apos;s devastating , but not completely ,
because it turns out i like sleeping crosswise in the bed
and not having to shave my legs .
my 3 year old used to be potty trained ,
and now he isn &apos;t
because his father no longer lives with us
and his world no longer makes sense ,
and the only thing he thinks he can control is his bladder .
so he urinates
in a lot of places you wish he wouldn &apos;t urinate .
you want lunch or you want to show me the scan ?
mr. morris . dr. shepherd .
i &apos;ll be filling in for dr . bailey today .
so you &apos;re here for a follow @-@ up ?
uh , yeah , yeah .
i had my gall bladder out a couple months ago .
months ? and you &apos;re still getting follow @-@ ups ?
i am , once a week .
once a week ?
yeah . dr. bailey says she just wants to make sure
i &apos;m in tip @-@ top shape .
dr. webber did your surgery ?
yeah . chief of surgery .
fancy , huh ?
yeah . mm @-@ hmm .
you guys are the best .
people say a lot of crap about health care ,
but they &apos;ve never been here .
you take care of people .
we certainly do . yeah .
mm . dr. bailey wll worried
&apos;cause i turned yellow after my first surgery .
mm @-@ hmm . oh , see ?
here .
but it went away .
i &apos;m fine now . you want to look at my scar
or wait till after i pee in the cup ?
oh , dr . altman , uh , the patient is no longer interested
he mechanical valve .
well , i couldn &apos;t give you a total unadulterated dream case .
people would talk .
uh , i just spent hours prepping for the mechanical .
a @-@ a pig valve is a whole different surgery .
two for the price of one .
just think about how much you &apos;re learning .
you want me to get someone else ?
no .
it &apos;s a concussion . it &apos;s no worse than you &apos;ve seen before .
nothing we need to go in and fix .
initially we thought
the injury to your spleen would resolve itself ,
but it &apos;s bleeding too much . dr. bailey needs to go in
and remove it as soon as possible .
the surgery is gonna have you out for a couple of weeks ,
but you &apos;ll be back in the game for next season .
tom ? you all right ?
oh , i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t breathe .
let &apos;s get some oxygen .
get a crash cart . tom ?
let &apos;s get some oxygen , all right ?
i can &apos;t breathe .
let &apos;s get an e.k.g. just in case .
tom , have you ever had a panic attack before ?
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just , uh ...
it &apos;s nothing .
there &apos;s daddy .
hey , how &apos;s my guy ? he &apos;s fine .
how &apos;s my guy ?
well , he was , um--
the , um , brain &apos;s okay .
but they gotta cut my belly open .
i can &apos;t play till next season .
honey ...
don &apos;t worry .
next season will be here before you know it .
what &apos;s the deal with you and reed ?
nothing .
you &apos;re not trading her surgery for sex , are you ?
give me a break ,
because if you are , it &apos;s gross .
look , if i sleep with her , it &apos;s &apos; cause i want to .
you gonna look me in the eye
and tell me derek never threw a craniotomy your way
after the two of you spent an hour in the on @-@ call room ?
please .
i know it may not feel like it ,
but you are still married ,
and izzie is coming-- you know what ?
i &apos;m done worrying about izzie
&apos;cause she sure as hell ain &apos;t worried about me .
this is the old alex--
sleeping with some random person
because you &apos;re angry and hurt .
that &apos;s what you always did .
and then we grew up and got married .
yeah , well , it turns out your stupid post @-@ it
is ten times the marriage my church wedding ever got me .
i &apos;m moving on .
hey , tom kates is having panic attacks ?
yeah . i don &apos;t know why . he &apos;s not talking .
i took care of your , uh , chole patient . it &apos;s all good .
uh , thanks .
yeah , he &apos;s getting some high @-@ class care .
six visits with a surgeon ?
a nurse practitioner could do this .
no , i like to do , uh , aftercare myself .
he wasn &apos;t even your patient . he was the chief &apos;s .
there was an error .
he &apos;s fine .
so why all the--
i have a thing for him , okay ?
sheldon morris ?
he caught my eye .
sheldon has a quality that i &apos;m ... drawn to .
i ... i can &apos;t put my finger on what it is exactly .
sure . sure .
want to keep his picture ?
do you know what my sister had for lunch today ?
pork chops . i watched her eat .
i didn &apos;t feel any kinship ... with the pig .
i think the pig valve , you know , may be the wrong choice .
uh , you feel more kinship with cows ?
i don &apos;t know .
mrs. carlin , um ,
we &apos;ve prepared the porcine valve replacement .
uh , a bovine replacement is a whole different surgery ,
like the mechanical valve was a whole different surgery .
do you think it &apos;s possible that i could see the valves--
right , the pig and the cow ? cause maybe then i could--
i could recognize one as more familiar .
well , we don &apos;t do that .
we don &apos;t march the parts around the hospital .
maybe we should call this off .
can i do that ?
if you &apos;re not comfortable , we can postpone it .
uh , no , no , no , no . i mean , i @-@ i can get the valves ...
and i &apos;ll bring them here .
oh ! okay ?
you &apos;re so wonderful .
you really are . you &apos;re ...
okay . great .
great .
she &apos;s so wonderful .
she is .
oh !
richard ... tom kates needs a splenectomy .
any chance i can get you to do the procedure ?
oh , well , i &apos;ve , uh , asked bailey to take over my service .
you know , with-- with the merger and all .
it &apos;s a high @-@ profile patient .
i thought you could make an exception .
sure .
you must have extras lying around .
we don &apos;t .
what , you--you never drop one ?
open up the box and see
that the pig has a cholesterol problem ?
let me check in the back .
okay .
she thinks maybe one of them will speak to her .
it &apos;s ringing .
i mean , i am prepping
for three different surgeries in one day .
chasing animal parts all over the hospital .
teddy thinks it &apos;s hysterical , but this may actually kill me .
maybe one of them will speak to her .
there are pros and cons for each .
at the end of the day ,
it &apos;s a gut thing--pig or cow ?
it &apos;s not a gut thing .
it &apos;s a decision based on fact and reason .
hey ! where are my parts ?
izzie , it &apos;s me .
um , i know you want space , but you can &apos;t have space .
because alex might be moving on .
come back and work in the clinic ,
cause you &apos;re throwing your career away .
cristina .
she got fired from surgery , not all medicine .
ignore her . just call me back . okay , bye .
there . that wasn &apos;t so difficult , was it ?
okay . got the first band .
let &apos;s move down so i can take a look at the second .
like that ?
good .
why can &apos;t i grab his leg ?
problem ?
no , it &apos;s just one of the bands is holding the leg in place
making it a little difficult to get around .
can you move the ultrasound up here ?
oh , come on .
what &apos;s the matter ?
her uterine arteries are engorged .
but the only way in is in between them .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need another trocar .
you want to hold this ?
are you sure you have enough room ?
those arteries are huge .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna be very , very careful . scalpel .
what happens if you nick them ?
dr. grey ?
she could bleed out . they both could .
i don &apos;t like it . it &apos;s too dangerous .
mark , i have assessed the risk factors .
i &apos;m 95 % confident i can get around the arteries .
i &apos;m choosing to continue my surgery .
and i don &apos;t like the other 5 % .
you hit any one of those .
she bleeds out right on this table .
look , you &apos;re nervous . i get that .
i &apos;m a surgeon , and i &apos;m looking at
a time bomb in a uterus .
shut it down . now , addison .
let &apos;s close her up .
you good to go ?
yeah . what , are you babysitting ?
cause i &apos;m new at this .
where &apos;s the chief ?
i don &apos;t know . check his office .
he said he was gonna do the surgery .
and then he told me he didn &apos;t have time
and asked me if i would do it ,
which i was planning on doing in the first place , so i said yes .
uh , he said something about a budget meeting .
i think he &apos;s pretty swamped .
if he &apos;s got time to watch old surgical films with you ,
he &apos;s not swamped .
what the hell is going on ?
the chole patient , your boyfriend ?
that was the chief &apos;s mistake .
and he hasn &apos;t touched a patient since then .
he &apos;s been busy with the merger .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard that story before .
what is going on ?
it is not my job to get involved in his personal life .
just like it &apos;s not your job to get involved in mine .
10 @-@ blade .
i made a judgment call . you didn &apos;t like it .
i &apos;m sorry .
you threw me on a plane in the middle of my morning coffee
because you wanted my judgment .
it was risky .
that is not your call to make in my o.r.
you acted like a father .
why do you think we don &apos;t let parents in the room
during an operation ?
i &apos;m not her father , addison .
biologically , yes , but ... i just met the kid .
i &apos;m helping out .
you reacted like a parent .
now i don &apos;t know when , i don &apos;t know how .
but at some point , you became a dad to that little urchin .
because you just lost it in my o.r ..
and mark sloan never loses it in the o.r.
not ever .
yes , it was risky ,
and , yes , most surgeons would &apos;ve jumped ship
at the sight of the engorged arteries .
but i am not most surgeons , and neither are you .
look , we can try this again ...
with you in the waiting room .
it &apos;s too risky . she &apos;s just a kid .
well , uh , have morrison
monitor the bands as the baby grows .
it might be okay .
i gotta go . patients at home .
congratulations .
you &apos;re a parent .
neither one is speaking to me .
oh , for god sake .
are they speaking to you ?
they aren &apos;t .
ruthie , if i put your own valve in front of you ,
it wouldn &apos;t speak to you either .
i have a cousin . his wife is a cardiologist .
i should call her .
no , no , no , okay ? no .
no more calls . this is about you and your heart .
and you need to use your instinct and make a decision .
right now-- pig or cow ?
but i ...
pig or cow ?
pig or cow ? don &apos;t think . just ... pig or cow ? go .
now ! now !
pig . no . cow .
pig ! pig ! pig . pig .
pig .
the procedure went well .
you &apos;re gonna be back on your feet in no time .
great .
great .
you &apos;re scared to play .
you thought you were done .
and when i said you &apos;d be back in the game next season ,
you panicked .
um ... i used to be able to block out the fear .
but ever since des was born ,
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m on that field , and my heart starts racing ,
and i can &apos;t catch my breath .
you know , i look at guys who played their whole careers .
they &apos;re hit so many times , they can barely remember
their own names .
and i &apos;m scared he &apos;s gonna grow up without a dad .
i &apos;m scared all the time .
it &apos;s a natural reaction . you &apos;re a father .
why don &apos;t you retire ?
oh , come on . two years into a pro career ?
i mean , i can &apos;t .
i mean , i know i &apos;m not a soldier in iraq
or--or a rocket scientist
or any kind of real hero .
i know i &apos;m just some big , dumb jock .
but i &apos;m a big , dumb jock the entire city ... roots for .
kids , guys on the street ...
i can &apos;t let them down .
this is the trade off .
i get hit .
mm . some guys can &apos;t even feed their families , you know ?
and some guys are soldiers in iraq ,
and they get shot at .
so--so i &apos;m not complaining .
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m scared of the hits .
i want to be able to remember who my kid is .
okay , no more bubbles .
okay , pressures are good . let &apos;s come off .
decannulating .
i told torres she had to let you scrub in if she was cutting .
cool .
book an on @-@ call room .
what ... what happened to drinks first ?
ah , it &apos;s kind of a waste of time , right ?
cut to the chase .
hey , reed .
do you know izzie stevens ?
grey .
yes . i met her before she got fired .
you know she &apos;s alex &apos;s wife .
and she &apos;s not here right now , but they &apos;re still married .
meredith , shut up .
no . some people think you &apos;re divorced ,
and you &apos;re not .
uh , you know , how about you just shut up
long enough to watch your friend tank her valve ?
how ... what ?
she &apos;s tachycardic .
suction .
take this . laps . i need more laps .
someone get me a sponge stick , please .
i &apos;m having difficulty locating the bleeder .
dr. altman ?
keep looking .
b.p. &apos; s dropping .
well , how come altman &apos;s not doing anything ?
suction . more suction .
yeah , knee looks like crap .
but that &apos;s been true for a long time .
he should be able to play through the pain .
what if he can &apos;t ?
what about a knee replacement , right now ?
he needs to stop .
how about we make it so it &apos;s not his idea ?
systolic &apos;s down to 80 .
i could suture directly or clamp .
i don &apos;t know which one to do .
i don &apos;t know either .
well , my guess is , is if you came and looked at it ,
you &apos;d have a better idea .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s true ,
but i &apos;m not the one operating .
this is a lot of blood .
she &apos;s crashing !
you &apos;re overthinking it .
dr. yang
look at the aorta . what does it tell you ?
that i have two options , and i don &apos;t know which one to do .
this is crazy . why isn &apos;t she helping her ?
how &apos;s it going ?
yang &apos;s killing her patient ,
and altman &apos;s reading &quot; the atlantic monthly . &quot;
if i suture , it might not hold ,
if i clamp , uh , it--it could rupture .
her b.p. &apos; s tanking .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m teaching , and she &apos;s learning .
she needs help . she may be too proud to say it ,
but how about we don &apos;t let this patient die
and give her a hand anyhow ?
she asked . she &apos;s not that proud . and i said no .
this patient is not going to die .
she is going to save the patient .
pig or cow ?
you are sitting on your hands - because you are angry with me .
get over yourself .
if that patient ...
dr. hunt , you are blowing my concentration .
now get out of my or .
pig or cow ? pig or cow ? pig or cow ? pig or cow ?
pig . clamp . 3 @-@ 0 wood pledget .
dr. torres and i think your knee needs replacing .
well , that &apos;s been true since college .
there &apos;s just too much degeneration .
the joint is completely shot .
you need a unicondylar repair ,
or you may lose the ability to walk .
but a knee replacement
will take me out of the game forever .
exactly .
okay , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s coming up .
look , right there .
look at that .
that &apos;s the minute we knew your mother was different .
oh , and that other hand holding the retractor ? that &apos;s garber .
he was the chief of surgery back then .
no one could believe it .
she walked in that room a resident
and walked out a legend .
derek was worried when you didn &apos;t show up
for the , uh , tom kates surgery .
yeah , derek worries .
that makes him a good guy . oh , look , look , look , look , look .
if dr. montgomery had hit it during the procedure ...
it &apos;s dangerous .
well , what about that band that &apos;s squeezing his thigh ?
he &apos;s not even gonna have a knee ?
sloan , you could have died .
well , i can &apos;t have a gimpy kid .
honey , i know i haven &apos;t been your father for long ,
but if you say &quot; gimp &quot; one more time , i &apos;m gonna smack you .
you don &apos;t get it .
he needs legs . okay ?
he doesn &apos;t have a dad , and he &apos;s got a stupid , slutty mom .
don &apos;t you see ?
i &apos;ve already hurt him enough by giving him me as a mother .
he needs feet .
sloan--
look , i don &apos;t know how to take care of any baby , okay ?
i can &apos;t have one that &apos;s hurt . i just can &apos;t handle it .
my mom doesn &apos;t even talk to me .
i &apos;m doing this alone .
please .
listen ...
you &apos;re not stupid .
and you &apos;re not slutty .
the sloans ...
are a ... passionate people .
you dragged yourself across the country
so that you could get help taking care of this baby .
that &apos;s not being stupid .
that &apos;s being a mom .
i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to you or the baby .
go to l.a.
addison said 95 % . that &apos;s not that bad .
let her do the surgery .
looks like we &apos;re going to l.a.
you &apos;re not gonna do this alone .
stay .
after the baby &apos;s born , live with me and lexie .
raise the baby with us .
i don &apos;t know anything about being a dad .
you don &apos;t know anything about being a mom .
maybe we could ...
figure it all out together .
really ?
yeah .
okay .
drill , please .
are you sure there &apos;s nothing i can do to help ?
uh , no .
so i &apos;m not gonna get to do anything in this surgery .
not worth what you paid for it ?
shut up .
you guys are all worked up about how
none of you get to operate anymore . but you know what ?
at some point , you &apos;ll log enough hours with a scalpel .
at some point , you &apos;ll be surgeons .
and one day ...
you &apos;ll look up and realize ,
&quot; wow , there &apos;s more in the world than cutting . &quot;
tom kates &apos; career is ending .
that is what &apos;s happening in this room .
so could you for one second
think about something other than yourselves ?
bone saw .
god . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m taking out
the best quarterback seattle &apos;s ever seen .
you &apos;re not .
he was out of the game a long time ago .
i would have stepped in .
i would not have let that patient get hurt .
i know that .
she needs to be pushed . she &apos;s like a racehorse .
you need to push her , otherwise she &apos;s gonna lose her mind .
i know , teddy .
so nothing else was going on in that room ?
owen ...
you ready to pay up ?
oh , that was the lamest assist in history .
it &apos;s hardly worth ...
oh , no . a deal &apos;s a deal .
look , okay , there might have been a little misunderstanding
about what &quot; you know &quot; means .
i @-@ i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t trade surgery for sex .
if you want sex ...
ask for it .
if you want surgery ,
go kiss an attending &apos;s ass , not mine .
hey , this is illegal and immoral and ...
and you two should be ashamed of yourselves .
charlie , go to hell .
how am i the bad guy here ?
i should &apos;ve asked you first ,
but i was so excited .
and i was so sure it was the right thing .
and you know why ? &apos; cause of you .
since you , i know , for the first time in my life ,
what the right thing is .
i am happy for you . i really am .
something happened today .
you became a dad , a real one .
and sloan , against all odds , became a mom .
but i didn &apos;t .
i was barely ready to move in with you ,
never mind your daughter and--and--and grandbaby .
i @-@ i just ... i don &apos;t want this .
you wanted to give your liver to your dad .
this is what you do for family , right ?
i understand why you &apos;re doing it .
i just don &apos;t understand why i &apos;m doing it .
well , i think you &apos;re doing it for me .
don &apos;t make me out to be the selfish one .
you don &apos;t get to unilaterally decide
to let a teenager and her infant move into our house .
well , we &apos;ll get a bigger place . she needs us .
lexie ...
i thought i missed this .
this is a chance for me .
don &apos;t make me choose between you and her .
why ?
&apos;cause you &apos;ll choose her ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll choose her .
i think our relationship just ended .
something &apos;s going on with the chief ,
and i can &apos;t figure it out .
i think he &apos;s scared to operate .
is that possible ?
you don &apos;t know or you &apos;re not gonna tell me ?
did you see that ? oh , i &apos;m holding the heart ,
i @-@ i feel it almost starting to fibrillate in my hand--
i mean , piss @-@ poor aortic tissue , i mean , possibly irreparable--
and then--bam .
sutures hold and it comes back .
please . i know . i don &apos;t want to see the face .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t want to hear what you have to say .
i @-@ i was fine . i was on fire . i know that .
i was learning . i felt alive for the first time
in i don &apos;t know how long , owen .
i was--it was like i had air in my lungs--
she &apos;s leaving ... seattle .
it &apos;s just not gonna work for her .
when i lost my nerve , the chief helped me .
it &apos;s ... nothing .
if it &apos;s nothing , find a way to look me in the eye .
what are you doing in here ?
moving in .
no . no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sick of living in that damn trailer .
go live in izzie &apos;s old room .
you go . she &apos;s your wife .
i thought you were shacking up with what &apos;s his face .
i &apos;m not .
the post @-@ it didn &apos;t say anything about lying
because i didn &apos;t think it needed it .
i &apos;m not lying .
you don &apos;t need to know every thought in my head .
i have relationships that don &apos;t involve--
meredith , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m too young to be a grandmother .
i &apos;m still supposed to be working like a dog
and--and--and then come home and do stupid things ,
like bungee jumping and jell @-@ o shots .
i don &apos;t even know
what people my own age do anymore .
i know something stupid you can do .
you never forget the moment you become a doctor .
i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i keep telling myself there &apos;s no problem ,
but if there &apos;s no problem , then why can &apos;t i just say it ?
a switch flips ...
suddenly you &apos;re not playing dress up anymore .
you own the white coat .
dr. altman , wait . wait .
what do you want ? i @-@ i--more money ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ll talk to the chief .
no , i--no--
you know , they can set up a new cardio unit with a--
with a research lab or-- or
you can work with vets .
it isn &apos;t about that .
wait . wait . no one--no one has ever believed in me like this .
you believe in me more than i do ,
and i need that . i ... i &apos;m gonna die here without that .
cristina , it &apos;s so complicated .
i can &apos;t--
you know , it &apos;s okay . just--fine .
tell me what you want , and i will make it happen .
i want owen .
fine ! done ! take him .
what you may not notice
is the moment that being a doctor ...
changes you .
