my father dissolves our marriage
in favor of more promising opportunity .
is there nothing left between us ?
memories only .
the arena is burned to fucking ground .
with many romans among the ashes !
can he be healed ?
this man is beyond what would warrant life .
his name is oenomaus and he is more than common man .
a hundred more bodies pulled from the arena .
this was found in the wreckage .
the gods have punished me by striking down my father .
it is not enough .
gaius ?
the only reason you have not joined your father
is the child that grows within you .
house slaves will never be gladiators .
we need fighting men .
perhaps it is time to revisit plans towards neapolis .
and its slaver ships from foreign wars .
you would attack the port ?
第七集
i do not care for the fucking rain .
nor disturbance at unreasonable hour .
i would have you quickly removed from such concerns .
and well compensated for allowing eyes
upon your latest offerings ,
in advance of auction ...
you must have pressing need ,
to venture out on such a night .
i fear the rising sun would dash hopes of it being met .
short of time , long of coin .
what form of slave narrows your purpose ?
i have a desire towards fighting men .
ah , gladiators !
i &apos;ve supplied rome with many of its &apos; finest champions .
sadly with the arena in capua gone ,
there &apos;s less interest in these men of such talents .
fortunate for my cause then .
come .
let us see how you can further aid it .
forgive the stench .
savages east of the rhine tend to favor their own shit .
i intended to have them scraped
and oiled before auction ,
but i feared that would do little to improve
their natural odor .
and how do you find the women ?
as unpleasant as their men .
i would not recommend lustful hand placed upon ...
keys , quickly .
release them .
you not from our lands .
yet i was once bound in chains by the romans , as you were .
a grievance i would see them pay dearly for .
he says they are with us .
a fortunate thing .
that we liberate a ship filled with your people .
the gods favor us .
no longer will we have to listen
to those fucking gauls again .
geht bruder .
good mercato spoke highly of you .
a grave misfortune that his tongue
has forevebeen silenced .
his passing cause for my presence before you .
passing ?
too gentle a word for how he was ushered from this life .
blood and brains staining the pulvinus
as he thought to flee spartacus &apos; wrath .
a thing that threatens to consume many innocent lives .
we had thought you were mangled corpse ,
the sundered beams of the arena your tomb .
the events of the day caused me absent proper mind .
it has since returned .
and you to our streets .
mercato my purpose , as i said .
there is the matter of coin ,
for services tended upon the sands .
you were secured to execute those shits
that follow spartacus .
i do not recall any falling to your sword .
it would have been happened
had spartacus not appeared .
and coin would have materialized the same .
yet the past cannot be altered .
i am without coin , magistrate .
i would not have returned otherwise .
for your years of pleasing the crowd in the arena .
now follow once noble monument ,
and collapse from sight .
magistrate ? apologies ,
my rudis was lost when the arena fell .
without it ...
you press beyond reason !
i &apos;ll winds has blown capua
from once steady course .
take further matter to praetor glaber .
perhaps you can entice coin from him as well ,
if caught upon proper mood .
... and misfortune .
we have all suffered loss of those closest to us .
even a senator of our great republic ,
a man my wife called father ,
has been ripped from this world
by spartacus and his mongrel hordes .
and now beloved seppius
has fallen to this festering disease of rebellion .
murdered by his own slaves ,
who even now spirited themselves away
to join spartacus against us .
we must be ever vigilant in these dark times .
we must bring to light even dimmest shadow
of betrayal if it is revealed to us .
from this day forward ,
any slave who dares to whisper the name spartacus
shall be put to death .
even those
owned by a praetor of rome .
seize her .
dominus !
i did nothing !
dominus !
do not speak against him .
listen how she begs !
pleading with the very tongue
that only yesterday had praise for spartacus upon it !
praise for the slaves that murdered seppius !
praise most fortunate to be overheard by loyal wife .
domina ...
it is true .
i hear her speak it .
would that she had more than one life to take .
let this serve as warning to any slave
who would conspire against us .
apologies --
none deserved .
it was a foolish attempt .
you seek to part head from shoulders .
there are blows that kill with less effort .
then i shall learn them .
he is never from her side .
spartacus wanted him towards neapolis ,
but he would not leave her .
though perhaps it &apos;s best to keep him and agron parted .
naevia is blessed to be loved so deeply .
as are you , by spartacus .
crixus !
i taught you never to lower guard .
now see naevia to same instruction .
oenomaus .
i thought you for the afterlife .
as i you .
yet we did not escaped deep wounds .
a thing to be visited upon the romans a thousand fold .
now that oenomaus stands with us once again .
he was a fool to be gone so long from your side .
such things are of the past .
let us turn thought towards future .
and what joys it may hold .
you &apos;ve done the impossible .
our ranks swell .
we will need more weapons .
a concern that must be addressed .
i sense a deeper one .
these are all fucking agron &apos;s people .
our forces have doubled in a single day .
with people who are no stranger to battle and blood .
and who will they follow ?
i detected a hint of movement in your hips this time .
a subtle thrust
as i bore down .
you begin to enjoy my cock inside of you ?
i would have answer .
yes .
yes ...
what ?
yes , dominus .
has a man ever heard so sweet a sound ?
your voice ...
your touch ...
the warmth of your thighs ....
is it a wonder quintus fell beneath your spell ?
lavishing you with affection and gifts .
you call me dominus now , in his place .
it is only just that i present you with something in return .
how did you come by such bounty ?
they were freely given .
by the dead who no longer have need for them .
when this chest is full ,
it &apos;s worth shall see ashur to even greater heights .
yet
for one such as you ...
something purchased with coin ...
i know how fond quintus was of the color .
i would have you wear it .
so that i may look up to you upon the balcony ...
and know that you are mine ...
heart has been deeply wounded .
if there is anything to offer as balm ,
you need but voice it .
you take command of his men ?
i do .
would that he had given them freely in life .
spartacus would be a distant memory .
and my brother yet by my side .
if only it had been so .
my father would yet grace this world .
and my slave would have had no cause to be crucified .
your brother &apos;s men arrive .
come .
let us review them ,
and bind them to cause with oath of loyalty .
fall to attention !
hold tongue ...
and give attention !
who stands forth as your voice ?
octavius tarsus .
i stand for them .
your benefactor has been ripped from this world by the villain spartacus .
towards his end ,
i conscript you and your men
into the army of gaius claudius glaber .
recite the sacramentum , and commit loyalty .
i , octavius tarsus ,
swear by jupiter optimus maximus ,
that i shall uphold and defend the republic .
i swear to have her enemies as my enemies
and her friends as my friends .
you &apos;ve taken to your old color .
i fear it no longer suits me .
... her honor in all my thoughts , words , and actions .
i pledge my body and life to the republic and to its army
under the leadership of praetor gaius claudius glaber .
will they be enough ?
added to my own troops , yes .
they will be enough to bring spartacus to justice .
i do not seek justice .
i seek vengeance .
the man who took the life of my brother must die the same .
in blood and slaughter .
by jupiter optimus maximus , i so swear .
by jupiter optimus maximus , we so swear .
set camp outside these walls .
salvius will see you to orders .
and the death of spartacus .
gratitude for your kindness .
know that i have treasured it .
perhaps it would be best if you made home here .
beneath our roof .
i leave in the morning for my uncle &apos;s villa in pompeii .
i would not have you upon the road
while the threat of spartacus still remains .
i will send word to your uncle ,
if you find solace in the thought .
your presence offers great comfort .
i am blessed to find myself among you .
come .
let us make arrangements .
was it so recent that i thought him weak ?
i now gaze into his eyes and tremble
at what lurks behind them .
do not work yourself into an unfortunate state .
your child --
is the only reason i yet live .
nothing i do pleases him .
he tortures me for what i have done .
thessala crucified .
seppia invited into our house .
the way he looks at her ...
i would see myself over cliff ,
if this is all fate now holds .
my heart would follow to the rocks below .
i cannot live like this .
nor i.
the last of our meat .
i forgot how much my kin devour upon a sitting .
much seems to have slipped mind of late .
you sent me to scout neapolis
and report on opportunity .
their ship provided it .
were there any others that may have afforded the same ?
two .
one from damascus .
the other gaullia .
news i would have cared to know .
men from damascus are of low quality
and even lower trust .
and gaullia ?
i would not have these ranks filled with gauls .
crixus -- - is an honorable man .
i will take your brothers to hunt when day breaks ,
to replenish supply .
and gauge how we might come together .
tell those who are able to speak in common tongue .
so all among us may know their thoughts .
they will prove great asset .
i give you my word .
cunt .
nothing &apos;s free .
i heard you were dead .
carried to the afterlife with all the others
that fell beneath the arena .
i yet breathe .
my purse however has suffered fatal blow .
i have no coin to pry open thighs .
they may yet widen , of their own accord .
a miracle lacking profit .
for you and your master .
do you recall what it was like to have one ?
before you gained your freedom ?
no man is ever truly free .
except for spartacus .
and those who follow him .
did you see him when he attacked the arena ?
what form of man was he ?
you speak of dangerous things .
i &apos;m not the only one .
there &apos;s talk among many of us
towards joining his cause .
there is no cause ...
only the leading of innocent fools to their death .
you have no coin then ?
a few denarii for passage away from this fucking city .
strike spartacus from your thoughts ,
and come with me ...
the mighty gannicus .
it is joyous occasion ,
to find you yet alive .
with ripe offering perched upon lap .
apologies .
it is unforgivable to come between man and cunt ,
yet i must have words with my brother .
an enticing creature .
of course you never lacked the attention of fine women .
if you seek words , break them and be done .
the years have not seen you to better manners .
nor you to better company .
i would advise caution .
these men are the hand of
praetor gaius claudius glaber .
and what are you ?
his cock or his ass ?
i am his will .
bound by duty to restore order .
by nailing little girls to the cross ?
any slaves who whispers of spartacus and his rebellion ...
shall find place beside her .
i have no interest in whispers .
nor the will of your praetor .
bold words .
from a slave .
you mistake me .
i am a free man .
yes , i was there upon the sands
when you became a god of the arena !
it was a sight never to be forgotten !
gannicus , besting twenty gladiators
in the primus of the opening day !
and his reward ?
the rudis !
a wooden sword carved with the legend of his victories !
proof of freedom , demanded by adoring crowd !
show them .
i am sure they would be eager
to lay eyes upon such rare marval .
no ?
you do not have it upon you ?
you know i do not .
as i know the praetor will be most pleased
with the presence of your company ...
i find it surprising that you are still of this world .
more so that you did not think it wise
to present yourself at sooner convenience .
apologies .
gannicus has always been a man of few words .
yet he favor the magistrate with whole sentences , i &apos;m told .
i sought only to conclude business .
you aim too low .
spartacus brings the arena down upon you ,
and yet here you stand .
a phoenix risen from its ashes .
the gods have truly blessed him .
as they now bless me ,
with his presence .
i was moved by the reaction of the crowd ,
when you stepped upon the sands .
the swell of their voices , heralding your name .
filling the air with hope .
even tarnished by blood and calamity ,
such a thing yet can hold value ...
your rudis .
and its price ?
a simple oath .
edging yourself to my command .
lucretia was also once thought victim of spartacus .
yet now stands a powerful symbol ,
used to calm spreading concern .
i would add you as such .
a former slave of the house of batiatus ,
now sworn to bring errant brothers to justice .
it appears you already have one of those .
ashur &apos;s talents are of the shadows .
i would present you in glorious light
at the front of my troops .
to the roar of the crowd once again .
and if i no longer crave for such a clamor ?
you &apos;re a free man .
your fate is your own .
i will send for you again in a few days .
and expect reasonable decision to accompany you .
praetor .
forgive me , praetor ,
but gannicus cannot be trusted .
the same once said of you .
yet here you stand .
see one of your men to follow .
if gannicus attempts to leave capua ,
crucify him .
is there no other way ?
you were right about gaius .
the man he was no longer peers from behind his eyes .
he will not bewayed by words or gentle touch .
only blood can set us free now .
lucretia ...
it will hurt but for a moment .
lift your dress .
neapolis ?
a slaver ship was set upon .
it carried prisoners captured east of the rhine .
warriors .
to aid spartacus &apos; cause .
an obvious conclusion .
dispatch men to neapolis .
question anyone who may have seen
where they were headed after liberation .
praetor .
gaius ...
fetch the medicus .
quickly !
ilithyia !
what has happened to her ?
it is a sign from the gods .
one carried by the child yet to breath life .
and its meaning ?
your heir will die if it remains in a city
cursed with blood and fear .
i will have her carried to rome as soon as she &apos;s able .
with trusted guard to watch over her at all times , until my return .
i shall accompany her and tend to her needs .
apologies , praetor .
lucretia &apos;s a dear friend to your wife ,
yet offers greater comfort to capua .
i fear the people will fall to despair ,
absent her divine presence .
wise counsel .
have your presence known tomorrow in the market .
ease mind of our city ,
and continue to assure them the gods favor my efforts .
we have been training those freed of bond .
yet none among us ever held title of doctore .
i have no knowledge of soldiers and war .
i know only the ways of a gladiator .
i can think of no fiercer army , so instructed .
open their eyes as man can do giving a course .
as you have opened mine .
i hunt with agron and his people ,
to better gauge them .
i will lend aid when i return .
i fear you hunt alone .
agron left with the others before light broke .
agron .
you hunt without me ,
when you knew my intention .
they woke before the sun ,
and were eager to take advantage of freedom .
we hunt .
catch meat .
and roman drink !
i did not know these forests were stocked with such .
where did you come by this ?
a wagon along the road --
you attacked the road so close to our position ?
absent proper weapons ?
no one see .
all dead .
glad i risked my life for this lot .
they see us to prope force .
they see us to nothing but discovery .
let the romans come .
i &apos;m tired of hiding like frightened bbits .
we are not ready for a direct assault .
something even a child could see .
this child helped save you from the arena .
and fills our numbers with warriors .
the pup has found himself nothing but a pack of wild dogs .
ones that will never follow a fucking gaul .
apologies for leaving without you .
i question that boy &apos;s sincerity .
let us break meal with our new brothers .
and attempt to settle this .
may the gods bless you ...
may the gods bless you ...
may the gods bless you ...
may the gods bless you ...
there &apos;s talk among many of us
towards joining his cause .
you knew her ?
a foolish girl .
who spoke too loudly of things she should not have .
the city is filled with ears
straining for whispers of betrayal .
it is filled with eyes as well ...
attempt to leave the city ,
and share a cross beside your friend .
i am not your slave .
and i will not bow to your threats .
nor would i see you .
the oracle of fucking riddles .
come to plain words .
i saw something in your eyes ,
when you stood before glaber .
i saw something beyond a man weighing decision .
the gods bless you with gift to see into my thoughts now , do they ?
more like her will die .
the guilty . the innocent .
there will stand no difference
when caught between glaber &apos;s wrath and spartacus &apos; vengeance .
and what would you have me do ?
take up offer
and turn on those that i once called brother ?
no .
i would have you end the life of gaius claudius glaber .
he is desperate to claim spartacus &apos; life .
so consumed , that he now stands more threat than the thracian himself .
and what difference would it make ?
rome would only send another to take his place .
spartacus blames glaber for part in his wife &apos;s death .
remove him from the world ,
and the scales of blood will be balanced .
spartacus will drift from rome .
no more lives will be lost . on either side .
glaber &apos;s own wife ,
this very night leaves for rome .
taking with her half his personal guard to see her safely from the city .
i could distract any that remain posted to the villa entry ,
giving opportunity for a single man
to take glabe &apos;s life while he sleeps .
and spartacus to receive the blame .
you have lost mind .
the whole world has slipped from reason .
i seek only to restore it .
rid yourself of ashur &apos;s man .
when moon stands highest i will see path cleared .
choose to set upon it .
or see legions fall to pointless suffering .
your people , they lift spirit .
not all are so moved .
perhaps they &apos;ll kill each other ,
and give proper cause for celebration .
you are an impossible man .
something thing you &apos;ve always known .
and chose to ignore .
to better see the man beneath his faults ... ?
sing with me , my dark brother !
share my woman .
i know not your words .
lugo will teach !
oenomaus finds himself assaulted .
they are a boisterous people .
sometimes wine and foolishness are needed .
to forge stronger bond .
sing with me !
now is not the time for such things .
is it ever ?
no .
i will try and wrest a drink from lugo for us to share .
and in the act , aid oenomaus in escape .
i tried to convince him to let you come .
he would not be moved .
it is a thing of no matter .
what you have done for me ...
would that we were never parted .
you shall find me again to your arms .
sooner than expected .
i sway gannicus to forever remove gaius from concern .
when it is done i will raise clamor ,
and see gannicus follow to the afterlife .
ilithyia .
it &apos;s time .
gaius --
you shall be missed .
wine .
we share .
gratitude , but crixus awaits .
the gaul , yes .
i see his eyes .
at me .
no love .
he needs time .
and drink .
i &apos;ll tell him .
tell him his eyes i not like .
your eyes better ...
let me pass .
crixus .
sedullus .
sedullus .
calm yourselves !
spartacus !
enough !
is this what you are ?
animals ,
demanding slaughter ?
we give you freedom .
and you repay it with blood and dishonor .
if you can not stand among us as trusted brother
if you can not follow my orders
take leave now .
or join sedullus in death .
i follow spartacus .
and call no man my kin that does not stand so .
the man that kills sedullus
is great warrior .
and lugo follow .
praetor , pressing concer .
gannicus has made his decision .
