i love this job .
tom &apos;s career took off .
and you gave me the confidence to jump at it .
i could kill you right now , or i could do this .
felicia made peace with paul ...
and don &apos;t you worry about paul .
or so he thought .
i &apos;ll make him pay for what he did to you .
look , i &apos;m your landlord . i have a right to come in .
but it was susan who gave him hope .
i remember a guy that used to live on this street .
he had a laugh you could hear three houses away .
i &apos;m not that man anymore .
i think you can be .
who do you want in your life--
me or bree ? choose .
and gaby made a decision .
can i stay with you for a while ?
of course .
girls , come on . go on in .
bree van de kamp had occasionally found her home
invaded by household pests .
and her manner of dealing with them was ruthless .
she smashed them .
she poisoned them .
she executed them .
but when it came to the latest pests
who had invaded bree &apos;s home ...
extermination was not an option .
girls ! there &apos;s mud on your shoes !
mud on your shoes !
girls ! we are guests here !
what have i said about wiping your feet ?
sorry .
no , no , no , no , no ! no , no , no !
just--uh , uh , never mind .
it hasn &apos;t rained in three weeks .
where did they find mud ?
honey , they don &apos;t find mud . mud finds them .
so , um , speaking of the fun we &apos;ve been having ,
how long do you think it &apos;ll be before you and carlos make up
and you can all ... go back home ?
eh , a few days .
he &apos;ll be sitting alone in that house ,
realizing how big it is , how quiet it is ...
how clean it is .
then he &apos;ll show up here with that hangdog look on his face ,
begging us to come back .
mom ! celia hit me !
then hit her back !
gaby , don &apos;t tell her to do that .
i &apos;d rather they settle it . otherwise ,
i have to go in there .
that &apos;s what a mother does . come on .
girls , if you stop fighting ,
then i &apos;ll let you have some fresh baked ... cookies ? !
there were two dozen cookies on that plate .
yeah , you can &apos;t leave food out .
they &apos;re like bears . you gotta tie it up in a tree .
uh , gaby , while you &apos;re here , this might be a good time
to teach them a little ... discipline .
discipline ? what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s not like the plate &apos;s broken .
oh , boy .
yes , bree van ve kamp had finally met two pests
she couldn &apos;t smash , poison , or shoot .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need a garbage bag .
unless it was an antique . then i need glue .
that &apos;s not to say she wasn &apos;t sorely tempted .
good deeds aren &apos;t always done for the purest of reasons .
we may be trying to impress .
we may be acting out of guilt .
we may be expecting something in return .
but occasionally ,
a good deed comes straight from the heart .
wow . what &apos;s this ?
your lunch . i got ham , ham and cheese ,
and that one &apos;s ham and gravel . i dropped it .
susan , you don &apos;t have to keep doing this .
i want to . you &apos;re my new project , mister .
your project ?
yes . paul young ,
phase two-- where we figure out what you are doing with your life ,
set some new goals .
now ... you tried destroying the neighborhood .
that didn &apos;t work out . what &apos;s next ?
i don &apos;t know what i wanna do .
i &apos;ve made such a mess of everything so far .
no , no . phase two is about the future , not the past .
so from now on , we are only looking forward .
oh , my god ! look behind you !
hello , susan .
oh . hey , felicia .
&quot; hey , felicia &quot; ? !
you knew she was in your house ?
i @-@ i thought you were in prison .
oh , i &apos;ve been out for weeks . what nice sandwiches .
are you cooking for paul now ?
yeah , for paul ...
the guy that you cut off your fingers to frame .
it &apos;s all right , susan .
felicia and i have reached an understanding .
we can hardly keep squabbling ,
now that we &apos;re going to be neighbors again .
wait . you &apos;re living here ?
right across the street .
i just came by to pick up some of beth &apos;s things .
although i think you should keep that pretty oil painting .
she made for you .
hang on . you--you knew beth ?
you didn &apos;t tell her .
the topic doesn &apos;t exactly introduce itself .
beth was felicia &apos;s daughter .
what ?
so you &apos;re beth &apos;s ...
and you knew ...
and you &apos;re living ...
i need to sit down .
we &apos;re gonna get a lot of this .
so felicia tillman was beth &apos;s mother ?
&quot; snip @-@ snip &quot; tillman ? you sure ?
yep .
and people say the suburbs are boring ?
great . now we &apos;ve got another nut job living on the street .
actually ...
paul is not so bad .
yeah , what were you doing over there ?
bringing him food . uh , checking up on him .
making sure he &apos;s okay .
why ?
&apos;cause i feel bad for him .
the poor guy has had two wives kill themselves .
and here i was concentrating all my pity on the dead people .
susan , be careful .
yeah , we understand beth gave you a kidney ,
but you don &apos;t owe paul anything .
i know i don &apos;t .
but that kidney gave me a second chance in life ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
i feel that paul deserves the same thing .
to us , our decorating firm ,
and our latest triumph ,
the delaney bathroom .
today , subway tile and a low @-@ flow toilet .
tomorrow , not walking in on mr. delaney
on the low @-@ flow toilet .
you bought this at a drugstore , didn &apos;t you ?
come on . &quot; dan perrignon . &quot; it &apos;s cute .
a little tip-- when picking champagne ,
wordplay usually isn &apos;t a selling point .
hey . you &apos;re home early .
no , just forgot some files .
head straight back to the office .
ooh ! dan perrignon ! what are you guys celebrating ?
renee and i finished a design job today .
yeah . we actually cleared $ 293 .
well , $ 290 after this champagne .
hey , we &apos;re a small company .
why is the glass always half empty with you ?
hey , i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t think of this sooner .
i just got my budget .
there &apos;s some money in there to redecorate my office .
how about you guys do it ?
uh , well , we &apos;re a little busy .
it &apos;s 20 grand .
busy thanking you .
you &apos;d let us do that ? you &apos;re amazing !
that would be huge for our company .
look , i know this new job &apos;s put a bit of a strain on us .
this might be a good way to sneak in
a little extra time together .
so you think you can do something for 20 grand ?
this may be the dog shampoo talking ,
but for 20 grand ,
we will decorate your office ...
and whack an employee of your choosing .
hey , roomie !
hello ... roomie .
those are beautiful .
they &apos;re for you from the girls .
they felt terrible about breaking your mirror .
oh . you mean my serving dish .
oh , you haven &apos;t been upstairs yet .
gaby !
but look how beautiful .
i &apos;m going to church .
weren &apos;t you just there ?
i need to do some more praying . apparently , it &apos;s not working .
if you &apos;re looking for the owner , that &apos;s me .
are you aware that you &apos;re blocking my driveway ?
yeah . are you aware
that you illegally entered my vehicle ?
well , i needed to get your attention .
doesn &apos;t make it legal .
oh , don &apos;t try to make this my fault .
blocking my driveway is illegal .
yes , but breaking into my car is criminal .
really ? let &apos;s call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
i &apos;d love to get a policeman &apos;s opinion on that .
you just did .
oh , my . you are a policeman .
detective chuck vance , fairview p.d.
your neighbor mrs. tillman &apos;s a parolee .
i was paying a routine call . but now it appears
that she &apos;s not the only dangerous woman on the street .
look , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what laws i may have broken , but--
unlawful trespass , tampering with a police vehicle ,
malicious mischief ...
okay , okay . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just so frazzled today .
a friend of mine is staying with me ,
and her two girls are absolute monsters .
in fact , i don &apos;t suppose i could borrow your gun ?
to shoot the children ?
i was joking .
so was i.
i &apos;m sorry i blocked your car .
uh , well , um ...
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry that , um , i got into yours .
i &apos;ll tell that to the judge .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll get off with community service .
wait .
what ?
still joking .
i &apos;m gonna get you ! you come back here !
no ! no ! no !
gaby ?
oh . right . girls ! no running !
is that all you &apos;re gonna do ?
of course not . next time i &apos;ll trip one of them .
or perhaps you could try taking a firmer hand .
oh , please . i &apos;ve tried everything .
i even bought them a puppy
just so i could threaten to kill it .
they asked if they could watch .
well , i can &apos;t take it anymore .
would you mind if i talked to them ?
perhaps hearing it from somebody else
would make the difference .
what are you saying , bree ?
you think you &apos;re a better mother than me ?
well , not to cast aspersions on tripping
and killing puppies ,
but there are other approaches .
okay , mother superior .
you think you can get those girls to behave ?
be my guest .
oh , and if the little one charges , move .
it &apos;s like someone dropping a sack of flour
off the empire state building .
girls , i need to talk to you .
not now . we &apos;re playing death match .
we do not fight in this house
with pillows made of hand @-@ dyed silk .
now i am gonna count to three . one ...
two ...
do you know what happens after three ?
four ?
put the pillows down .
now , i am sure you &apos;ve heard the expression ,
&quot; my house , my rules . &quot;
no .
well , there is an expression-- &quot; my house , my rules . &quot;
and as long as you are staying here with me ,
you will behave properly . you will mind your manners ,
you will do your chores . you will listen when spoken to .
and-- where are they going ?
hmm ? i wasn &apos;t paying attention . what were you telling &apos; em ?
girls , get back here !
don &apos;t smirk . the key to discipline is consistency .
and i will not give up .
neither will they , bree .
neither will they .
wow , if i knew tom was working with so many handsome rich men ,
i would have worn a lower top .
lower ? i think you would call that a belt .
will you look at this ? he &apos;s kept us waiting 45 minutes .
good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up .
ah . if he keeps us waiting any longer ,
i know two legs that won &apos;t be going up .
sorry about the wait .
i just got off the phone with london .
closed a deal worth $ 10 million . phyllis ?
okay , ladies , i have 15 minutes ,
and they are all yours .
that is all we need .
the overall look we &apos;re going for is very warm and inviting .
we &apos;re thinking soft wood , an overstuffed linen sofa .
that sounds great , but i already know what i want .
ripped that out of a magazine .
this is donald trump &apos;s office .
isn &apos;t it cool ?
i @-@ i love that desk-- black marble and chrome .
a @-@ and look at that samurai sword and those dragon lamps .
i &apos;m sorry . are you planning to take over the world
with your death ray ?
i think this is impressive .
but ... it &apos;s not you .
you &apos;d need a telephone book
to sit behind that desk .
lynette , if this is what our client wants ...
thank you , renee .
you know , when doug played for the yankees ,
&quot; the donald &quot; invited us on his yacht all the time .
i &apos;ll just call his assistant and find out where they got the desk .
&quot; the donald . &quot;
you &apos;re wondering if you can pull off &quot; the tom , &quot; aren &apos;t you ?
no .
good , because the idea of you in an office like this--
is totally workable .
why don &apos;t we get some pieces in here over the weekend ?
and you can take a look on monday .
now that is the attitude i like--can @-@ do .
i have a meeting . great work , everyone . mm .
see phyllis on the way out . she &apos;ll validate your parking .
wow , that was easy . i know a place that has
these fabulous chrome and steel pieces .
we &apos;re not doing that .
why not ?
because that &apos;s not tom .
he &apos;s definitely a soft wood kind of guy .
okay , lesson one-- tom is the client .
if he wants a big shot office , he gets it . ugh !
and lesson two-- no man wants to be referred to
as &quot; soft wood . &quot;
felicia . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry to drop by without calling .
is this a bad time ?
yeah , it is . uh , i &apos;m in the middle of cooking dinner .
of course .
i @-@ i just ...
i was missing beth so much , and ...
then i remembered that part of her was still alive somewhere .
could you spare a few minutes
for a woman who lost her only child ?
sure . come in .
smells good .
oh , it &apos;s for paul . chicken pot pie .
right . you said you were cooking for him .
that &apos;s so thoughtful .
well , just trying to be a good friend .
i hope that we can be friends , too .
you do ?
you and me ? friends ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
what i did to paul was horrible ,
but thank god , he &apos;s forgiven me ,
and now i just want things back to normal .
i even got this glove so people wouldn &apos;t be put off by me .
what , you--you mean the finger thing ?
oh , people hardly notice it . but the glove is good .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i ... get these migraines .
could i trouble you for some aspirin ?
sure . hang on .
this smells wonderful .
i wouldn &apos;t begin to know how to make a pot pie .
well , the crust is store @-@ bought .
but don &apos;t tell paul , okay ?
don &apos;t you worry .
i know how to keep a secret .
&quot; with repeated small doses of the toxin ,
death is both slow and agonizing . &quot;
what did i tell you , dear ? it &apos;s so much better than a bullet .
&quot; initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting .
these are followed by metabolic acidosis
and cardiovascular dysfunction . &quot;
he &apos;ll think it &apos;s his heart .
as if he had one .
&quot; and finally , acute renal failure and ...
death . &quot;
and you know the best part ?
i couldn &apos;t get near paul &apos;s food if it weren &apos;t for you ...
or at least that last little piece of you
that &apos;s still alive in susan .
it just goes to show ...
you may be gone ...
but we &apos;re still one heck of a team .
susan , how &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t get it . he just keeps getting worse and worse .
i think i &apos;m gonna have to start bringing him breakfast , too .
you &apos;re a good friend .
daddy ! i missed you so much !
oh , i missed you , too . ho @-@ ho @-@ ho !
why don &apos;t you guys go wash up for dinner ? go on .
so tomorrow after school , they come back to me , right ?
right .
carlos , how did we get here ?
we &apos;re talking like a divorced couple .
what do you want me to say ?
just tell me how long this is gonna go on .
how long are you gonna be friends with bree ?
carlos--
&apos;cause that is how long it &apos;s gonna go on .
what are you doing ?
giving my plant a drink .
why do you hate mommy so much ?
i don &apos;t hate mommy . i just ...
i &apos;m mad at something bree did .
what did she do ?
well ... it &apos;s kind of a grown @-@ up thing , honey .
you guys say that about everything
you don &apos;t wanna talk about .
you &apos;re right .
sit .
you know grandma died .
but you never heard the story of how it happened .
hey , have you seen our bank statement ?
i &apos;m in the middle of a quiz .
well , i think you might like this a lot better than ...
&quot; are you having enough orgasms ? &quot;
oh ! i just had one .
we actually have money !
we paid all of our bills , and we have money left over .
well , the insurance is covering your surgery 100 % ,
and add that to the money you won playing poker--by the way ,
don &apos;t do that again--and we &apos;re finally out of the hole .
in fact , we can afford to move back into our old house .
oh , that would be great .
but we can &apos;t until paul &apos;s ready to leave .
well , he might be ready a little sooner
if his new best buddy asked him .
mike ... i &apos;m not gonna do that to paul .
think of what he &apos;s been through . he &apos;s a wreck .
well , maybe moving out of a house
filled with memories of beth would be good for him .
am i supposed to believe
that you are suddenly interested in paul &apos;s well @-@ being ?
look , i don &apos;t like the guy . i never will .
but as long as you &apos;re taking him under your wing ,
why can &apos;t we get something out of it ?
so ...
now do you understand why i &apos;m so upset ?
i know it &apos;s a complicated story . you have any questions ?
no , daddy .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go grab my wallet , and we are gonna go get pizza .
celia , come here .
you know what daddy just told me ?
bree killed grandma .
hello , girls .
did you have a nice time at your father &apos;s last night ?
well , now that you &apos;re back at my house ,
i &apos;d like to try once again to discuss my rules .
that be okay ?
yes , mrs. van de kamp .
oh , hello , gaby .
what is this ?
juanita &apos;s helping me make dinner . good job .
now after you &apos;re done washing the brussels sprouts ,
you can help me set the table .
yes , mrs. van de kamp .
brussels sprouts ?
you do know the girls are eating here tonight ?
yes . don &apos;t they like brussels sprouts ?
sure ... as projectiles .
well , they &apos;ll eat them tonight , or no cupcakes .
you actually left those out in plain sight ?
have you learned nothing ?
you could lose the sideboard .
oh , they won &apos;t touch them , not till i tell them they can .
thank you for straightening up , celia .
now would you please help your sister in the kitchen ?
okay . what the hell did you do to them ?
oh , i simply sat them down and explained
what i expected of them while they &apos;re staying here .
oh , cut the crap , van de kamp .
did you give &apos; em drugs ? threaten &apos; em ?
children don &apos;t respond to threats .
they respond to structure provided with a firm hand .
so you hit them .
if you stick to my system ,
by the time you take these girls back to carlos ,
they &apos;ll be perfectly behaved . you &apos;re welcome .
hey , sweetie .
you can relax . she went upstairs .
no , i have to get this done .
do you want a cupcake ?
mrs. van de kamp says those are for after dinner .
well , mrs. van de kamp isn &apos;t here .
i &apos;m not saying i love this more than you and celia ,
but if the three of you fell in a pool ,
and i could only save two ,
one of you would finally get her own room .
here . sneak this upstairs . eat it later .
no , thanks . i &apos;ll have an apple .
what did she do to you ? ! how did she break you ? !
okay , those go right in front of the desk .
yes , ma &apos;am .
and watch the ... yeah . thank you .
uh , what &apos;s going on ? i told the movers to be here at 11 : 00 .
yeah . i made a teensy change .
and this is not the furniture i ordered .
again , teensy change .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t believe you did this behind my back .
we &apos;re supposed to be a team .
i almost bought you
a coffee this morning without you even asking .
but you didn &apos;t .
yeah , and i felt bad about it ...
till now .
i &apos;ve got two dragon lamps in my car .
what the hell am i supposed to do with those ?
i &apos;m sorry , but trust me ,
i &apos;m saving us time .
how ? tom said what he wants .
tom said what he thinks he wants .
i know what he really wants .
and you have to admit ,
looks pretty good , doesn &apos;t it ? all comfy and cozy ...
yeah , lynette , you did a great job
ignoring what he asked for .
all that &apos;s missing is an antique jar
for tom to put his testicles in .
juanita , what is it ?
get away ! get away !
you &apos;re just having a nightmare !
honest , everything is okay !
they won &apos;t come out .
not even for you ?
nope . that &apos;s how scared you got them .
i swear , i didn &apos;t do anything .
i went in to check on them ,
and they got hysterical .
carlos , it &apos;s me . where are you ?
the girls won &apos;t come out for anyone except their daddy .
it &apos;s about time !
okay , carlos ... who the hell are you ?
detective vance , fairview p.d.
we got a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call from 2 girls
who say that their mom &apos;s crazy friend is trying to kill them .
what ?
hello again .
i guess you found someone to loan you that gun .
okay .
i spoke with the girls . they &apos;re pretty sure
that mrs. van de kamp here was trying to murder them .
well , that &apos;s preposterous .
why would they say such a thing ?
well , that &apos;s not all they said .
gaby ? what &apos;s with the panicked pho calls ?
it &apos;s nothing .
the girls got all freaked out and called the police .
freaked out about what ?
are you the father ?
yeah . carlos solis .
detective vance .
mr. solis , did you tell your daughter that
mrs. van de kamp killed your mother ?
did you tell her that , sir ?
i think i know what this is .
me and the girls were talking about my mother &apos;s death ,
and i said being apart from their mom
felt almost as bad ,
and i said that i blamed bree for that .
they must have gotten confused .
yeah , well , don &apos;t be mad at them .
it &apos;s hard on kids when their parents are apart .
it &apos;s actually kind of funny if you think about it .
i mean , not &quot; funny &quot; funny , but sad ... funny .
daddy !
hey , girls ...
so sorry to have dragged you out here in the middle of the night .
no problem . i hope everything ... you know , works out .
let me walk you to your car .
let &apos;s go pack your stuff . i &apos;m taking you home .
i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t kill someone .
i &apos;d have felt pretty dumb
for not arresting you when i had the chance .
uh , tell me something . when someone calls 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1,
don &apos;t they usually just send a patrolman ?
i was at dispatch when the call came through .
when i heard the address , i said , &quot; i &apos;ll take it . &quot;
i wanted to see you again .
really ?
about what ?
your neighbor , mrs. tillman . here &apos;s my card .
if you see anything suspicious , i want you to call me .
okay .
or even if you don &apos;t .
what is it about you ?
i never have a clue what you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m a detective . i find clues . i don &apos;t give them .
good night , citizen .
good night , detective .
they are almost done packing .
i can &apos;t believe you told them .
juanita wanted to know why we were fighting .
i told her the truth .
great . so now they think mommy walked out on daddy
to live with the lady
that killed grandma ?
well , that is kind of what you did . and i never said
that bree killed their grandma . i said that she helped
the person who did kill her get away with it .
yes . she was protecting her child ,
which is exactly what we &apos;d do if it was our kid in trouble .
families stick together .
then why are you living here ?
why did you pick bree over me ?
carlos , thank you
for not saying anything in front of that policeman .
you think i did this for you ?
well , i just assumed--
that was for andrew .
he was a kid when all this happened .
you weren &apos;t .
okay , lay off her , carlos . she &apos;s apologized again and again .
well , i don &apos;t forgive her ,
and as long as you &apos;re taking her side , i don &apos;t forgive you , either .
we &apos;re ready , daddy .
let &apos;s go home .
i &apos;m sorry . i just keep waiting for this to blow over .
we have to face it , gaby .
this is never gonna blow over .
so what am i gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna go home to your husband .
i feel guilty enough about carlos losing his mother .
i will not be responsible for him losing his wife .
that means you and me ...
yeah .
i know .
i &apos;ll call you , okay ?
please ...
don &apos;t .
these look delicious . nicely done .
well , i had help .
i just stirred the batter .
a very important job ,
so you get to try the first one .
no .
i don &apos;t want to spoil my dinner .
please ? i want to know
that they taste good , and i &apos;m allergic to nuts .
well , i ... i guess that makes me the ... guinea pig .
best i &apos;ve ever tasted .
but ... not good enough to finish ?
they &apos;re terrible , aren &apos;t they ?
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna toss these and start again .
no . you can &apos;t . i ...
i just didn &apos;t want to break my diet ...
but who can resist with these ?
they &apos;re really good ?
like nothing i have ever eaten .
i &apos;m gonna get you some milk to wash that down .
no , i can &apos;t stay .
i , uh ...
need to go buy a new handbag .
what &apos;s wrong with that one ?
my keys ...
you &apos;re not still mad at me , are you ?
no . i &apos;m good .
because i think
we &apos;re gonna see a happy client walk out of his new office .
any second now .
you two ...
i love it !
you do ?
love it !
you do ! hey ...
well , you live with someone for 25 years ,
you might know a thing or two about a thing or two .
come on .
but ... that &apos;s not ...
where we told them to put the desk .
you &apos;re right , lynette .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;s perfect right here .
i mean , look at this ! the only way
it could be more intimidating is if flames shot out of it .
is there any way that we could ...
nah ! forget it .
and what is it about leather that just says ,
&quot; i own your ass . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m out of order ? no , you &apos;re out of order .
get out !
so you really like this ?
i love it . you know , i was a little worried about
how this was gonna work out , but you came through .
i mean , you captured it . it &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s amazing--
the rug that we haven &apos;t put down yet . let &apos;s get to that showroom ,
lynette , before some other hotshot takes it .
thanks again .
how could you do that ?
do what ? make our customer happy ?
oh , he &apos;s kidding himself .
that testosterone trap is not tom .
maybe it &apos;s not the tom who &apos;s been pitching in
with carpool the past few years ,
but the tom who &apos;s running this company ?
yeah , it is , and you need to accept that .
you &apos;re not gonna accept that .
no .
you cannot be serious .
what are you talking about ?
this . this whole master of the universe playroom .
i @-@ i thought you liked it .
i ... hate it .
then why did you do it this way ?
i didn &apos;t ! i had a whole other office in here !
then renee came and changed it .
then good for renee .
at least one of you gets me .
tom ...
this office is not who you are .
you &apos;re a great , down @-@ to @-@ earth guy ,
not some jerk that has to show people how powerful he is .
i am powerful ...
and i do need to show it .
i am surrounded by gunslinger kids who &apos;d steal this job
in a heartbeat if they weren &apos;t a little scared of me .
i have a role to play ,
and i play it damn well ,
and i &apos;m sorry if that threatens you .
it doesn &apos;t threaten me .
i just don &apos;t want to lose the guy i married .
oh , you mean tom the screwup ?
the one who couldn &apos;t make a &quot; go &quot; of the pizza parlor ?
the one you could always put your arm around at the end of the day ,
and say , &quot; it &apos;s okay , honey . i &apos;ll get us through &quot; ?
don &apos;t make it sound like i &apos;m not glad you &apos;re succeeding ,
&apos;cause i am .
you say that . you say that all the time ,
but i am waiting for a sign to see that you actually mean it .
and i thought this office was that sign .
i mean , i walked in here and i thought ,
&quot; how great is this ? she gets it .
she &apos;s happy . she &apos;s proud of me . &quot;
my mistake .
ed nicks . you in ?
yes .
w @-@ we can &apos;t end the conversation like this .
i have to take this call .
hey , eddie , how are ya ?
what , are you kidding ?
the chance to kick your ass at golf and take your money ?
you don &apos;t have to ask me twice .
tuesday works .
yeah , i &apos;ll let you hit from the ladies &apos; tees .
no good , huh ?
no , i &apos;m just not very hungry these days .
are you okay ?
a little dizzy .
sit . i &apos;ll clean up .
oh , um , you took down beth &apos;s painting ?
yeah . some days it &apos;s nice to be reminded of her ,
but others ...
it &apos;s too many memories .
hey , um ... did you ever think living in this house
might be one of the reasons you feel so bad ?
maybe you could use a change of scenery ?
you mean leave fairview ?
no , no , no , just this house .
i couldn &apos;t do that to you . where you gonna find another tenant ?
well , that &apos;s the great part . mike and i have been saving up ,
and now we &apos;re ready to move back in .
i &apos;m an idiot .
what ?
very impressive , susan .
i actually thought you gave a damn about me .
what are you talking about ? of course i do .
bringing me food , checking in on me--
it was a masterful performance .
must have been hard being patient , though--
not show your hand too soon .
you don &apos;t give a crap about me .
it &apos;s this house you wanted .
no , paul , that &apos;s not true .
i swear , mike suggested it , and--
mike . of course he &apos;s in on it .
i bet you had a hell of a time planning out the whole thing .
i knew nobody on this street cared about me ,
but for you to pretend you did just to get something out of me ,
that makes you the worst one of all !
paul , please . oh ! aah !
leave me alone ! and this time , i mean it .
people do good deeds for many reasons ,
but sometimes good deeds have bad consequences .
correcting a colleague &apos;s mistake could breed resentment .
opening one &apos;s home to a friend
can damage that friendship .
trying to bring a spouse closer
might push her further away .
that &apos;s why
there &apos;s an old expression about helping people--
no good deed ...
