central perk is proud to present miss phoebe buffay .
thanks .
i &apos;d iike to start with a song about a man i recently met ...
... who &apos;s come to be very important to me .
you don &apos; t have to be awake to be my man
long as you have brain waves i &apos;ll be there to hold your hand
though we just met the other day
there &apos; s something i have got to say
thank you very much . i &apos; m gonna take a short break .
that was phoebe buffay , everybody .
what the hell was that ?
phoebe just started
i was talking to joey . aii right , there , mother @-@ kisser ?
&quot; mother @-@ kisser . &quot;
i &apos;ii shut up .
i know you &apos; re still mad at me ...
... but there were two people there that night .
there were two sets of iips .
i expect this from her .
she &apos;s always been a freudian nightmare .
then why don &apos;t you say something ?
because it &apos;s complicated . it &apos;s complex .
you kissed my mom .
we &apos; re rehearsing a greek play .
that &apos;s funny . are we done now ?
you mean you &apos; re not gonna tell her how you feel ?
just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom ...
... doesn &apos;t mean you know her . you can &apos;t talk to her .
okay . &quot; you can &apos;t &quot; ? or you can &apos;t ?
okay , that &apos;s my finger .
okay , that &apos;s my knee .
still doing the play .
what did you do with him ?
you &apos;re awake .
look at you .
how do you feel ?
a iittle woozy , but basically okay .
gosh , you iook good .
i feel good .
who are you ?
sorry .
i &apos;m phoebe .
i &apos; m monica . i &apos;ve been caring for you .
we both have .
the etch a sketch is from you ?
actually , me .
i got you the foot massager .
i shaved you .
i read to you .
i sang .
well , thanks .
oh , my pleasure .
you &apos; re welcome .
so i guess i &apos;ii see you around .
what ? that &apos;s it ?
&quot; see you around &quot; ?
what do you want me to say ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe ...
... &quot; that was nice . &quot;
&quot; it meant something to me . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ii call you . &quot;
okay . i &apos;ii call you .
i don &apos;t think you mean that .
this is so typical .
you know , we give and we give ...
... and we give .
and we just get nothing back .
and then one day , you wake up , and it &apos;s , &quot; see you around . &quot;
let &apos;s go , phoebe .
you know what ? we thought you were different .
but i guess it was just the coma .
the car &apos;s waiting . i just wanted to drop off my book for your friends .
autographed . and give you a goodbye kiss .
here &apos;s the kiss , here &apos;s the goodbye ....
anything you want from lisbon ?
just knowing you &apos; re there is enough .
aii right . well , be good . i iove you .
you kissed my best ross .
or something to that effect .
look , it was stupid .
really stupid .
really stupid .
i don &apos;t even know how it happened .
i &apos; m sorry , honey . i promise it will never happen again .
really , really stupid .
really , really stupid .
are we okay now ?
yeah .
no .
the forbidden iove of a man and his door .
he told her off . and not just about the kiss .
you &apos;re kidding ?
he said , &quot; when are you gonna start being a mom ? &quot;
then she said :
&quot; the question is , when are you gonna realize i have a bomb ? &quot;
are you sure she didn &apos;t say :
&quot; when are you gonna grow up and realize i am your mom ? &quot;
that makes more sense .
you think ?
what &apos;s going on now ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve been standing here spelling it out for you .
i don &apos;t hear anything . wait .
what do you see ?
it &apos;s hard to tell . they &apos;re tiny and upside down .
wait , wait , wait .
they &apos;re walking away . they &apos;re walking away .
no , they &apos; re not . they &apos; re coming right at us . run !
are you okay , kiddo ?
yeah , i &apos; m okay .
aii right . you be good .
drive safe .
mrs. bing .
mr. geller .
you mean that ?
yeah , why not ?
so i told her .
how did it go ?
awful . awful .
couldn &apos;t have gone worse .
well , how do you feel ?
pretty good .
i told her .
well , see ?
so maybe it wasn &apos;t such a bad idea , me kissing your mom , huh ?
but we don &apos;t have to go down that road .
this is just the first chapter ...
... and i want your absolute honest opinion . okay ?
and on page two , he &apos;s not reaching for her &quot; heaving beasts . &quot;
she could have heaving beasts .
right , but in this case she doesn &apos;t .
what &apos;s a &quot; niffle &quot; ?
you can usually find them on the heaving beasts .
okay , so i &apos; m not a great typist .
did you get to the part about his &quot; huge , throbbing pens &quot; ?
you don &apos;t wanna be around when he starts writing with those .
that &apos;s it . give them back .
