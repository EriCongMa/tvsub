none of that . not while you &apos;re under my roof !
what ?
just because i know about you doesn &apos;t mean i like looking at it .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be at an audition ?
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not a middle @-@ aged black woman .
i &apos;m also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition .
if i pretend to not know about you ... then you pretend there &apos;s nothing to know .
okay
sorry .
i can hear that !
rachel &apos;s at work .
i can still hear you !
the one with the yeti
hi
what &apos;s that ?
my mom sent me an heirloom that belonged to my grandmother .
can you believe it ?
a year ago i had no family , and now i have heirlooms !
the only heirloom i ever got was a feather boa .
got if from my dad . he got it from his dad .
how did i ever get born ?
oh , god !
soft .
is this mink ?
why would my mother send me a fur ?
doesn &apos;t she know me but at all ?
i have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make .
just filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody ... for 12 cents an hour .
that didn &apos;t happen , i made that up .
hey
ross , you can &apos;t put up flyers in here .
how come ? everybody else does .
you can &apos;t .
what is that ?
i &apos;m getting rid of some things .
this is all of your things .
yes , it is .
it &apos;s good . emily thinks we should get all new stuff .
stuff that &apos;s just ours . together . brand new .
so it &apos;s a get @-@ rid @-@ of @-@ anything- rachel @-@ ever @-@ touched sale .
touched , used , sat on , slept on ....
i &apos;ll take it all .
you &apos;re okay with that ?
if i can just do what emily wants ... and get her to new york , it will be fine .
isn &apos;t that a little extreme ?
after what i did , can you blame her ?
you got off easy .
when my friend silvie &apos;s husband said another name in bed ... she cursed him and turned his thingy green .
i guess i &apos;m lucky emily is not magic .
oh , she is.we all are .
what is he doing ?
emily thinks ross &apos; furniture has got rachel cooties ?
calm down , joey .
everything &apos;s getting all messed up !
emily won &apos;t let ross see rachel .
we won &apos;t stop seeing rachel.hence , ross stops seeing us .
i hate this . everything &apos;s changing .
we &apos;re losing ross . joey said &quot; hence . &quot;
i &apos;m not happy about this either ,
but if ross says he &apos;s happy ...
... then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves .
are you cool with that ?
no
but , you know , i &apos;m an actor .
i &apos;ll act cool .
probably be some of the hardest acting i &apos;ve ever done .
maybe i &apos;ll play it with a mustache .
storage rooms give me the creeps .
please hurry up , honey .
if you want little round waffles , wait till i find the iron .
i want the little round waffles .
here it is !
right underneath the can of bug bomb .
is the best place to put something that cooks food underneath poison ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll have toast .
fog him ! fog him !
i don &apos;t know what to do about this coat .
i &apos;ll take it .
that might work .
what do you think ?
you &apos;re on in five , ms. minnelli .
no , it &apos;s just a bit sudden .
it &apos;s great , okay ? i am totally onboard .
i love you too . all right , bye .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing . no , actually ... great news !
i just spoke with emily ... and looks like i &apos;m moving to a new apartment .
why ?
her thought is , and i agree ...
... fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ?
her cousin has a place to sublet .
it &apos;s got a view of the river and columbia on the other .
that &apos;s way uptown ! that &apos;s three trains away ...
... which is great !
i love to ride that rail .
you &apos;re okay with this ?
it &apos;s kind of far from work ...
... but i &apos;ll get so much done on the commute .
i &apos;ve been given the gift of time .
that &apos;s so funny . last christmas i got the gift of space .
we should get them together and make a continuum .
now he &apos;s moving ?
man , what is emily doing to him ?
he &apos;s not even here !
you guys !
we were in the storage area , and we saw this creepy man .
it was this crazy @-@ eyed , hairy beast @-@ man .
it was like a big foot or a yeti or something .
he came at us , so rachel used a bug bomb on him .
i pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass .
like , dark hair , bushy beard ?
yeah , you fogged danny .
please ! we did not fog danny .
who &apos;s danny ?
danny just moved in .
he just got back from a four @-@ month trek in the andes . nice fella .
he &apos;s nice . you know , you always ... stick up for the people we fog .
yep.-hi
you might not remember us , but we &apos;re the girls that fogged you .
we &apos;re really sorry we fogged you .
okay
just so you know , we didn &apos;t mean to fog you .
we thought you were like a yeti or something .
okay
yes ?
sorry to bother you ,
but we can &apos;t accept your acceptance of our apology .
it doesn &apos;t really seem like you mean it .
yes
okay
that guy is so rude !
really ! what is with that guy ?
you &apos;d forgive me if i fogged you .
you did , a little bit .
oh , my god , honey . i &apos;m so sorry .
i totally forgive you .
really ? -yes
hey ! -hey
you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium ?
crematorium chris ? sure .
he said he would cremate my fur coat for free ...
... if i bring in the next person i know who dies .
oh , my god ! oh , my god . look at these pelts !
don &apos;t get too attached . she &apos;s having it cremated .
what ?
phoebe , honey
you &apos;re quirky , and i get a big kick out of it . we all do .
but if you destroy a coat like this ... that is like a crime against nature .
not nature . fashion !
this is fashion ?
so to you , death is fashion ?
that &apos;s funny .
here &apos;s phoebe sporting cutting @-@ edge hairy carcass
from , you know , the steel traps of wintry russia .
you really think this looks good ?
because i do !
i miss you too . i can &apos;t wait to see you .
i love you . bye .
what is in here , rocks ?
no , it &apos;s my collection of fossil samples .
so , rocks .
i &apos;ll miss this apartment .
you know , ben took his first steps right over there .
remember when i ran into this and it knocked me out ?
i love this place .
to tell the truth , i wish i didn &apos;t have to move .
are you saying that you &apos;re not entirely happy about this ?
if emily gave me a choice ... you do have a choice !
why are you listening to her ? are you crazy ?
what ?
it &apos;s not right what emily wants you to do .
she &apos;s totally
stop pinching me !
you guys said to keep my mouth shut if ross was happy , right ?
he just told me that he &apos;s not entirely happy .
what &apos;s going on ?
we all hate emily !
no ,
ross , we do not hate emily .
we just think that you &apos;re having to sacrifice ... a whole lot to make her happy .
yes
we just think that maybe she &apos;s being a little unreasonable .
yes , unreasonable .
unreasonable ?
how about we have this conversation when one of you marries ?
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work .
it &apos;s compromise . do you always like it ? no .
do you do it ? yes .
because it &apos;s not all laughing , happy , candy in the sky ... coffee at central perk .
it &apos;s real life , okay ?
it &apos;s what grownups do .
i think he &apos;s right .
you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much .
i feel so guilty about ross .
i know .
i kind of feel like it &apos;s my fault .
kind of ?
if you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened .
i &apos;m keeping so many things to myself , something was bound to slip out !
i think it &apos;s very brave what you said .
i can &apos;t sit here anymore . i have to walk places .
what &apos;s with the coat ? how about the animal rights thing ?
i &apos;ve been reading up ,
and for your information ... minks aren &apos;t very nice .
so they deserve to be killed ?
well , they are real bad .
okay , i admit it . i love this coat , okay ?
it &apos;s the best thing i ever had wrapped around me , including phil huntley .
remember phil huntley ? he was fine .
hi
so you like the short hair better ?
what ?
yeti ? danny ?
i had to cut my hair to get rid of ... the fogger smell .
listen , i &apos;m so sorry . i would have never fogged you ...
... if you hadn &apos;t looked so ....
absolutely .
some people are just into appearances .
what ?
it &apos;s cool .
no , that is not cool.you don &apos;t even know me .
you got the shopping bags and the saks catalog .
from that , you &apos;ve got me all figured out ?
well , you don &apos;t .
you know , i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here .
do you ?
you know , if kids like to play with capri pants .
okay
stop saying that . i hate that !
okay
fine , i judged you .
i made a snap judgment.but you did it too ,
and you &apos;re worse .
you &apos;re sticking to your judgment .
you can &apos;t even open your mind to see you might be wrong.what does that say about you ?
that pizza place across the street any good ?
what ? -i &apos;m hungry . you want some pizza ?
you can keep yelling .
okay
okay
stop saying that . i hate that .
ross
are you still mad ?
good ! we have an &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; song .
you know what ? i &apos;m not in the mood .
look , ross.i feel really bad .
you &apos;re going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk .
we are so sorry .
you &apos;re stepping on the song .
we were way out of line , all right ? we totally support you .
whatever you decide , whatever you do .
now you &apos;re just taking lines out of the song .
this is hard enough , okay ?
i really need you guys right now .
yes , exactly ! and that &apos;s why ....
why don &apos;t you come over tonight , and i &apos;ll make your favorite dinner .
okay
thanks , you guys .
are you wearing fur ?
let &apos;s get some perspective , people.it &apos;s not like i &apos;m wearing a seeing @-@ eye dog coat !
you know , i think i kind of understand why i lost it today .
you do , huh ?
you see ... i &apos;m an actor , right ?
so i got to keep my emotions right at the surface .
i got a lot of balls in the air , you know ?
it &apos;s tough . guys like me , you wander around , you &apos;re alone .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not sure .
hi
look at you ! where have you been ?
i went to have pizza.with danny .
how did that happen ?
that yeti is one smooth talker .
yetis are smooth @-@ talkers . that &apos;s why you never see any pictures of them .
&quot; come here , baby . give me the camera . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re not full . dinner &apos;s almost ready .
i think i &apos;ll probably just hang out in my room .
why ?
come on , you guys !
if emily knew i was having dinner with you ,
she &apos;d flip out.you know it
it &apos;s okay . i really don &apos;t mind .
wait , wait . you know what ? just stay .
please .
it would mean a lot for me if you stay .
ross , i just ... -please , just have dinner with us !
okay joey , settle down.all right . i &apos;m sorry .
you see , rach , i &apos;m an actor .
hey , look ! ugly naked guy &apos;s back .
we haven &apos;t seen him in so long .
oh , god ! i really missed that fat bastard .
this is so weird .
i realized this may be the last time we hang out together .
it &apos;s almost as if he knew .
i &apos;ll get it .
hello
hi , emily .
you tracked him down . hold on .
hey
yeah , we &apos;re just having dinner .
sure , hold on.she wants to say hi .
hi , emily !
hello , everyone .
so who am i saying hello to ?
well , i don &apos;t know about who &apos;s here ... but i can tell you for damn sure who &apos;s not here , and that &apos;s rachel !
i should hope not .
ross knows better than that by now .
you know what ? rachel is here .
she &apos;s there ?
oh , yeah , there she is !
she &apos;s here .
take me off speakerphone .
hi
how could you do this to me ?
i made my feelings about rachel perfectly clear .
i &apos;m just having dinner with my friends , okay ?
you can &apos;t keep away from her .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
hello ? hello ? -who is this ?
it &apos;s ross . what are you doing ?
sorry , dude , i had to make a call .
joey .
joey , they don &apos;t have two lines , they have two phones .
gotcha .
i &apos;m sorry . emily , listen . i have never cheated on you .
i &apos;m moving for you .
i &apos;m cutting friends out of my life for you .
please , get on the plane and come to new york , okay ?
you &apos;re the only one i want to be with .
i &apos;ll feel better when i &apos;m there .
i can know where you are all the time .
you can &apos;t know where i am all the time .
this marriage will never work if you don &apos;t trust me .
you &apos;re right .
can you trust me ?
no
i think it &apos;s going okay .
looks like he &apos;s smiling .
how can you tell ? you can only see his back .
you can totally tell !
here , look , watch me .
smile.frown. smile.frown.
smile .
i guess that &apos;s it .
why ? what happened ?
my marriage is over.what ?
oh , sweetie
look at you , you &apos;re shivering .
here .
honey , is there anything we can do ?
you can help me get my furniture back from gunther .
stop tormenting me !
this is mink , okay ? they &apos;re mean ,
and they hate squirrels .
most of these probably wanted to be coats .
fine . no , i get it .
here .
you take it .
