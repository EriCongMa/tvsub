if she hadn &apos;t given you back that ring ,
you &apos;d be married to her right now .
possibly .
put your arm around me .
nice work .
it was easy .
well , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ll be back for it on monday .
as soon as the banks open , i &apos;ll have the cash .
here you go .
is this some kind of a joke ?
i @-@ i brought in a ring .
not according to the ticket .
somebody broke into our garage ?
did they get into the house ? is anything else missing ?
looking for someone ?
no . i thought that you were the only one living here .
i am .
melissa
is this a suicide note or a confession ?
it &apos;s both .
emily ... how do you have this ?
i sent it to her .
i took a picture with my phone before we called the cops .
it &apos;s weird-- why would ian kill himself
just as he was about to skip town with melissa ?
maybe he realized he was gonna get caught .
he couldn &apos;t hide forever ,
even with melissa and wren &apos;s help .
he was probably desperate .
look , who cares why ian did it ?
the important thing is , ali &apos;s killer is dead
and we &apos;re no longer people of interest .
why am i not feeling relieved right now ?
oh , em , come on .
for months , we &apos;ve been about as welcome
in this town as a cold sore ,
and plus , now people know that we &apos;ve been telling the truth .
and ian is out of our lives for good .
yeah ... but &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t .
can we please just slay one dragon at a time ?
what are you doing here ?
i just came to return
some evidence we took from the field hockey office .
hey , um , look , i just wanted to say
that i &apos;m sorry you all had to be the ones who found him .
melissa &apos;s the one who found him .
i &apos;m sorry . then again , could have been worse .
what do you mean ?
bodies decay . he &apos;d been dead at least a week .
give my best to your family .
yeah .
a week ? !
no , that &apos;s impossible . he was texting melissa .
no , he wasn &apos;t . i &apos;m betting it was &quot; a. &quot;
why would &quot; a &quot; pretend to be ian
and then lead us there to his body ?
does it matter ?
the guy was scum , and now he &apos;s dead scum .
who cares if &quot; a &quot; found him first ?
what does &quot; a &quot; want ?
you know what i want ?
i want to enjoy my life again ...
before &quot; a &quot; finds another way to ruin it .
are you coming ?
no , you guys go ahead .
em , what is it ?
we now know &quot; a &quot; is involved .
doesn &apos;t that make you nervous ?
yeah ...
but not as much as ian did .
could we just please take a break from looking over our shoulder ?
绝命书是不是看起来很眼熟 -a
well , thanks for calling , jeff
i really appreciate it .
oh , we &apos;re hanging in there .
yeah . okay , i will . bye .
are you gonna answer that ?
reporters have been calling all day .
listen , you bottom- feeding vultures ,
stop sucking the life out of my family .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , grandma .
let-- let me give her to you .
hi , ma .
yeah , i know . it &apos;s crazy here .
let me call you back , okay ?
did you reach somebody ?
it wasn &apos;t easy .
finally got ahold of his aunt .
she wants nothing to do with us .
meaning what , exactly ?
meaning she doesn &apos;t want to give him a funeral .
so what now ?
we &apos;re responsible for burying him ?
let &apos;s just-- let &apos;s talk about this later .
no , no , veronica . we can &apos;t put this off .
what options do we have ?
we can turn him over to the county !
i @-@ i think ... we need to give him a funeral .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
sweetie , no one expects us to give him a funeral .
we &apos;ll regret it if we don &apos;t .
please .
i think she needs this .
let us think about it , okay ?
do you want ice ?
sure .
uh ... we don &apos;t have any ? are you hungry ?
do you have any food ?
no .
that &apos;s ... on the list too ,
after ice .
my mom &apos;s been too busy to shop .
so , why are you here , anyway ?
well , i heard what happened , and i just ...
wanted to see how you were holding up .
you don &apos;t have to check in on me anymore , okay ?
one fake date does not a relationship make .
wait . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s been a stressful couple of days .
have you ever seen one ?
a dead body , i mean .
yeah .
hanna ?
yeah , i &apos;m in here .
why didn &apos;t you answer your phone ?
it &apos;s off . i &apos;m charging it .
i left messages .
&apos;bout what ?
that &apos;s not the point .
when i call , i need to be able
to reach you , always .
okay .
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
did something happen with dad ?
is it work ?
this whole ... past year ...
whenever you have left the house ,
there &apos;s a part of me that &apos;s been terrified
that you might never come back .
every time you walk out that door ,
i memorize the color of your top ,
whether you &apos;re wearing jeans or a skirt ,
what kind of shoes you have on ,
just in case i ever have to--
no , mom , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t go there .
we don &apos;t have to worry about this anymore .
it &apos;s over .
we can breathe again .
yeah .
i never understood what people meant
when they said they had an out @-@ of @-@ body experience ,
but after i heard melissa scream ...
it was like everything was in slow motion .
look , it &apos;s ... going to take a long time
for that night to go away .
i think the hardest part is ...
hey , &quot; z , &quot; i wanted ...
sorry . i didn &apos;t realize .
hey , jackie , this is aria ,
a former student of mine .
i think we &apos;ve met , actually .
aren &apos;t you professor montgomery &apos;s daughter ?
yeah , um , we met at my parents &apos; place , i think .
i @-@ i was just on the way to my dad &apos;s office
when i ran into ... mr. fitz .
she &apos;s not your student anymore .
i think you can let the girl call you by your first name .
i just stopped by &apos; cause
the psych department moved their conference to friday .
we don &apos;t have to take over your lecture hall after all .
nice seeing you again , aria .
mmm , you too !
&quot; z &quot; ?
all my college friends call me that .
yeah , well , from ages 2 to 7,
my family used to call me &quot; pookie bear , &quot;
but ... all good things must come to an end .
aria .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just ...
frustrating , you know ?
the whole point of you working here was so that
you wouldn &apos;t have to introduce me as your former student .
you didn &apos;t have to offer up that stuff about your dad .
you basically demoted me to a pit stop .
okay , whatever .
clearly , we both need to find some way
to warm people up to the idea of us as a couple .
how about i start introducing you as pookie bear ?
mmm ! no .
how &apos; bout you just start introducing me as a friend ?
okay .
sounds like a plan .
hey . someone tried to deliver a package to my house .
it &apos;s probably for my mom , but she &apos;s out of town .
i was wondering if i could sign for it .
do you have any i.d. ?
sure .
do i know you ?
uh , no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think so .
did you go to rosewood high ?
uh , n @-@ no .
um ... excuse me . i &apos;ve got to make a delivery .
look , somebody paid me to drop off this bag
and pick up a package .
he found me online . my name is logan reed .
i made you some tea .
oh , thanks .
wren called ,
to see how you and melissa were .
that was nice of him .
it &apos;s a good thing your father didn &apos;t answer . he would have hung up .
he &apos;s not as forgiving as i am .
i thought your teachers
gave you extensions on all of your homework .
oh , they did . but ...
exams are still next week .
you work so hard .
you always have .
we made the arrangements for the funeral .
there will be no frills ,
no flowers , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , no tears .
your father and i were very
moved by your desire to do this for your sister .
i just think she needs some kind of ceremony .
you were right .
we did need to do this .
i called the girls to see
if they would come to the funeral to support you .
it &apos;s the least i can do .
i &apos;m the one that separated you .
mom , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not okay that i didn &apos;t believe you ,
and it &apos;s not okay that i ...
that i allowed a monster in my house .
but i promise i will never do it again .
will you give me another chance ?
of course .
i love you so much , honey .
mike .
what were you thinking ?
hey ! mike !
he broke into your house ?
never got in , actually . caught him at the window .
the house was dark .
i &apos;m guessing he thought no one was home .
i &apos;m really sorry .
he &apos;s-- he &apos;s never done anything like this before .
thank you for not calling the police .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i really don &apos;t know what to tell you .
look , if ...
if i tell my parents , they are gonna flip out .
but if i don &apos;t , then he &apos;s--
no , don &apos;t . he knows he &apos;s been busted .
why-- why didn &apos;t you ? call the police ?
i &apos;ve seen enough cops in my house
for one year .
right .
anyway ... thanks .
thanks again .
yeah .
bye .
look , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m really sorry
that you got caught in a full @-@ on chick flick yesterday .
no worries .
my mom usually try and save eat , pray , love moments
for when we &apos;re alone .
hey , don &apos;t apologize , okay ? you &apos;re lucky .
the only thing my foster mom cares about
is cashing the checks .
i thought you were living at lucas &apos;s .
i am .
then why is your foster mom still getting money for you ?
i mean , you don &apos;t even live with her .
that &apos;s the deal .
as long as i show up for that visit
from child services , janet leaves me alone .
no , caleb , why do you have to settle for that ?
i &apos;m sure there are so many other amazing people--
yeah , i &apos;m sure that there are ,
but i could end up with a lot worse .
it &apos;s a short jump from eat , pray , love
to drink , snap , slap .
ian didn &apos;t commit suicide .
that entire suicide letter is made up of &quot; a &quot; texts .
what ?
how do you know that ?
when i read it again ,
a couple of words stuck out to me .
on a hunch , i checked my old text messages .
come here .
&quot; i killed alison .
&quot; i lost my temper because she knew too much .
there &apos;s only so much you can bury .
it won &apos;t be that easy ,
but i know how to get rid of the pain .
i can &apos;t run from the law .
come and find me . ian . &quot;
so these are the parts from the texts .
there are only five people that know about these texts--
us and &quot; a. &quot;
it means that &quot; a &quot; wrote that suicide note .
how did you figure this out ?
please . i &apos;ve been watching
wheel of fortune with my mom since i was 3 .
if &quot; a &quot; wrote this , that means that ian
never actually confessed
to killing ali in writing .
it gets worse .
logan reed , the guy who dropped off the money for ian
the night of the sting ?
well , i know where he works .
we need more answers .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
look , i don &apos;t know anything , okay ?
would you chill ?
i &apos;m not trying to get you in trouble .
i just want to ask you a few questions .
i saw a posting online .
someone was offering cash to make a same @-@ day delivery ,
so i @-@ i answered it .
so ian paid you in cash .
who ? what guy who killed himself ?
no , i @-@ i never even met him .
i never even spoke to him . a woman hired me .
what woman ? what did she look like ?
i never met her either .
when i spoke to her on the phone ,
she told me where to go and what to say .
so , how did she pay you ?
we used a p.o. box .
can you describe her voice
or tell me how old you think this woman was ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know how to describe voices ,
but i think i &apos;d recognize it if i heard it again .
thanks so much for your concern .
i will be sure to have all these forms back to you by tomorrow .
what happened to giving me a head &apos;s up ?
do you know how stupid it makes me look
when i can &apos;t answer questions about you ?
here &apos;s a crib sheet . i like kung @-@ fu flicks ,
my favorite color is blue ,
and i once went four days without a meal .
cute . don &apos;t let it happen again .
it is a serious pain in the ass
for me to come all the way down here just to drop these off .
mike , why are you avoiding me ?
i &apos;m not avoiding you .
every time i try to talk to you , you run the other way .
it was stupid . i was bored , okay ?
okay , let me get this straight .
you decide to commit a felony
because they take wrestling off tuesday nights ?
sure . let &apos;s go with that .
oh , mike , come on , i &apos;m trying to help you .
why did you break into the house ?
what were you looking for ?
i didn &apos;t take anything , okay ?
if it &apos;s such a big deal ,
i &apos;ll put emily &apos;s junky camping gear back .
let &apos;s just drop it .
wait .
you were the one that broke into emily &apos;s garage ?
did you break into spencer &apos;s house
and body @-@ check me too ?
that wasn &apos;t on purpose .
i felt bad .
i could tell .
you running away into the night was especially touching .
i panicked , okay ?
so what ?
what , you have something against my friends ?
couldn &apos;t you have just broken into some stranger &apos;s house ?
i have .
i promise you , i won &apos;t do it again .
just please , don &apos;t tell .
unless you want mom and dad to start fighting again .
hey , can i talk to you for a minute ?
i know a lot has happened between us ,
and i realize that if i expect you
to be honest with me ,
then i need to be honest with you .
i was angry when you chose ian over me ,
and so that &apos;s why , when i--
sweetie , will you do me a favor
and set the dining room table ?
i &apos;m gonna go set the table .
so , mom , i need your opinion .
absolutely not .
what ? i haven &apos;t even asked you yet .
hanna , it &apos;s a funeral ,
not a nicki minaj concert .
so what ? i can &apos;t dance on his grave ?
can i at least throw confetti ?
hanna , we are there to support the hastings .
it &apos;s hard enough burying someone everyone hates .
you don &apos;t need to call attention to it .
is that how grandpa &apos;s funeral was ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
didn &apos;t go to my father &apos;s funeral .
did anyone go ?
i assume whatever live @-@ in girlfriend he had at the time .
well , then , how do you even know he had a funeral ?
because it took me forever to pay it off .
had to spread it out over four credit cards .
do you ever regret it ?
not going ?
no .
i left town by the time i was 17,
and if i could have , i would have left sooner .
so what stopped you ?
freedom costs , hanna .
can &apos;t put everything on a credit card .
who &apos;s ringing it this time ?
thanks for being here .
how &apos;s your family doing ?
what are the cops doing here ?
um ... my parents wanted them here
in case any uninvited guests showed up .
i thought my no @-@ party @-@ crashers policy
was strict .
i think spencer means
&quot; angry mob with torches &quot; type guests .
i should probably get back to my family .
thanks .
spencer , wait .
it turns out ian wasn &apos;t the one who hired logan .
i can &apos;t talk about this now , emily .
look , i know this isn &apos;t the best place ,
but you haven &apos;t called me back .
because i don &apos;t want to talk about it , period .
i just can &apos;t do this anymore , okay ?
look , maybe dr. sullivan was right .
maybe we are obsessed , and maybe that &apos;s what &quot; a &quot; wants ,
for us to stay obsessed .
did you ever think about that ?
keeping us suspended in time--
the years are passing us by ,
and we &apos;re still rereading old suicide notes
and hunting down delivery boys for clues .
don &apos;t you want to know the truth ?
don &apos;t we owe that to alison ?
it &apos;s not gonna bring her back .
nothing we ever do is gonna bring her back ,
and i need to focus on
keeping the people that are still here .
ezra . i didn &apos;t know you were coming to this .
uh ... i didn &apos;t plan on it .
hey .
but after speaking with aria ,
i realized how important it is
to ... um ...
show my support for all the students by coming--
not only for spencer , but for all the students
affected by the tragedies of this past year .
i &apos;m sure the kids really appreciate it .
come on , sit with us .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure .
i know this is gonna sound weird , but ...
i didn &apos;t know who else to talk to at this point .
what &apos;s on your mind , emily ?
it wasn &apos;t ian who hired logan reed ,
the guy who delivered the money in the woods .
he never met ian . he was hired by a woman .
and ... how do you know this ?
he works at that delivery service on van owen .
i spoke to him .
well , that &apos;s definitely strange ,
but we &apos;re just about to bury the killer .
what are you ... asking me to do here ?
i ... i don &apos;t know .
if it &apos;ll make you sleep better ,
i &apos;ll try to find out who that woman is .
you did the right thing , telling me .
okay .
thank you .
you waiting for fitz ?
uh ... just waiting for my parents .
who &apos;s he waiting for ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he came here for the same reason we did .
to spit on ian &apos;s grave ?
to get closure .
well ... i still think he &apos;s creepy .
even if he wasn &apos;t hiding ian ,
the guy &apos;s a freak , and he always has been .
i &apos;m gonna go .
tell your parents i said goodbye .
okay . bye .
aria .
can i talk to you ?
yeah . should i round up the rest of the student body
so you can just address us as a group ?
look , i really did come here to see you ,
to take the next step , but it just wasn &apos;t right .
well , do you know when the exact right place and time is ?
because we keep talking about slowly moving forward
and dipping our toes in the pool .
aria , telling your parents is not toe @-@ dipping ,
it &apos;s a cannonball .
i know .
ohh . this would be so much easier
if i could just blame it all on you .
thanks .
you know what i mean .
i know that this isn &apos;t anybody &apos;s fault .
that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that i @-@ i really needed a hug from you today .
not ... later at your apartment
or tomorrow at hollis ,
but here , right now .
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll call you , later .
excuse me . hello ?
janet .
yeah ?
hi . i &apos;m hanna . i &apos;m a friend of caleb &apos;s .
that &apos;s nice , hon . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m in a hurry .
this won &apos;t take long .
i just want to let you know
that i know about your deal with caleb .
deal ?
you know what i &apos;m talking about ,
and it &apos;s gonna have to stop .
do you see that lady over there ?
that &apos;s my mom .
she &apos;s also a senior partner at the firm of
汉娜随口编的名字都离不开品牌
dolce &amp; gabbana and leibowitz ,
so i suggest that you give caleb his money
and continue to give him his money until he turns 18,
or i &apos;ll have to unleash erin brockovich on you
and haul your butt into court .
hey .
hi .
thanks again for ... helping my brother out .
why are you so willing to give my brother a free pass ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause
ali used to threaten to turn me in all the time .
did she ever ?
ali was too smart for that .
even as a kid .
she was fearless .
she needed to be .
i was always jealous of that .
of her .
i guess that &apos;s why
my parents can &apos;t even look at me anymore--
they know they lost the wrong kid .
don &apos;t say that .
look ...
maybe you coming here today was a mistake .
just the opposite , actually .
you don &apos;t know how good it feels
to know it wasn &apos;t me .
i don &apos;t remember a thing
from the night ali died .
i blacked out and woke up the next morning
with a wicked hangover and ...
and this .
who gave you this ?
what-- what does this mean ?
i don &apos;t know , but ... it almost destroyed me .
you thought that you killed her ?
like i said , i was jealous ,
and when i got loaded , i got angry .
but ...
ian &apos;s confession has changed everything .
he did it , not me .
hey , i &apos;m going out . do you need anything ?
it &apos;s a girl .
it is ?
yeah .
congratulations .
i &apos;m sorry i chose ian over you .
i just ... couldn &apos;t believe that he would ever ...
do that to someone .
finding out he wasn &apos;t who i thought he was ,
it &apos;s like ... losing him twice .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no .
i deserve it .
i &apos;ve lied so much
to you , to the cops , to mom and dad .
god , i thought i was protecting an innocent man .
we all make mistakes . i @-@ i have too .
a couple of days ago , i found your r--
wait , spencer . let me get this out while i have the courage .
there &apos;s something that you don &apos;t know , and--
why do you have ian &apos;s phone ?
i don &apos;t know .
wait a minute .
you-- you sent me those texts ?
what ? no !
i know he &apos;s been dead over a week !
i know he didn &apos;t send me those messages !
no , melissa , i didn &apos;t !
you pretended to be ian ? how could you do that to me ?
i swear to you , i didn &apos;t !
you must really hate me !
i will never forgive you for this !
honey , you &apos;re starting to scare me .
you &apos;ve washed clothes that haven &apos;t even been worn yet .
i can &apos;t help it . everything just feels dirty .
come on , let &apos;s go downstairs and have a glass of wine .
or scotch .
absinthe ?
he was a coach at our children &apos;s school .
i used to say hi to him in the teachers &apos; lounge .
you couldn &apos;t have known what he &apos;d done .
none of us did .
he really seemed like a nice guy .
i guess we see what we want to see .
i &apos;m going out , grab food with my friends .
can you stop washing my sweats ?
i smell like a candle .
i &apos;ll take that glass of absinthe now .
count it if you like .
that &apos;s okay . i believe you .
good . then i guess i won &apos;t be seeing you again .
i guess not .
hey , jenna , it &apos;s me .
yeah , don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s taken care of .
mom !
mom !
hi . what &apos;s up ?
i know the funeral was today .
i just wanted to come check on you ...
and to give you this .
when rappers brag about showering their ladies with ice ,
they mean something else .
i also got ... this :
soup dumplings and walnut shrimp .
that was sweet .
before you get carried away ,
it &apos;s gonna need to be reheated .
i probably should have sprung for two bags .
look , caleb , you really didn &apos;t have to do this .
how much do i owe you ?
nothing . i &apos;m good .
weirdest thing :
janet showed up out of nowhere
and gave me an envelope filled with cash .
really ?
yeah .
wow . that &apos;s crazy .
i know . but i guess i shouldn &apos;t look a gift horse in the mouth .
yeah , especially when horse @-@ face is giving you money !
well , i should probably go .
goonies is on tv tonight .
promised lucas i &apos;d watch it with him .
oh . all right , well , that sounds fun .
you must not have heard me .
i said we &apos;re watching goonies tonight .
what was that for ?
dolce , gabbana &amp; leibowitz ?
wait .
okay , if we get caught , we are in so much trouble !
oh , please .
like we &apos;re the first teenagers to sneak in a graveyard ?
it &apos;s like chapter one of every stephen king book .
guys ! not helping .
okay , i think we &apos;re close .
wait . stop .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not going any further
until you tell me why we &apos;re here .
i told you , i think &quot; a &quot; set us up .
and i do too .
emily &apos;s right . this isn &apos;t over .
i thought i &apos;d feel differently once we buried ian ,
but i don &apos;t ,
and it &apos;s because &quot; a &quot; is still alive and calling the shots .
but what does that mean ?
i think &quot; a &quot; took the body
and made it look like a suicide .
why would &quot; a &quot; do that ?
so that the confession in the suicide note
makes ali &apos;s murder look like an open @-@ and @-@ shut case .
but that would mean that &quot; a &quot; was helping us .
this whole time , we &apos;ve been trying to convince the police that ian killed ali .
exactly .
and why would &quot; a &quot; help us
when we know that &quot; a &quot; ultimately wants to hurt us ?
ugh ! i &apos;m confused , and i &apos;m stepping on something mushy .
what spence means is , how do we know for sure
that ian is ali &apos;s killer ?
what do you mean ? the &quot; kissing rock &quot; video .
and-- and the missing tree .
&quot; a &quot; gave us those things .
&quot; a &quot; is the one who handed us ali &apos;s killer on a silver platter .
and whatever &quot; a &quot; gives , the bitch takes back .
guys , look .
i know you want to kiss me .
come closer .
where &apos;s it coming from ?
oh , my god !
she was still alive !
thanks for meeting me .
i definitely think the projector &apos;s over here .
i don &apos;t know . had to be closer .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t further away ?
wasn &apos;t it on the ground ?
