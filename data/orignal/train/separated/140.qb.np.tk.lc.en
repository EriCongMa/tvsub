第七季 第二十集
and what do you want ?
you .
you &apos;re not getting divorced because of me ?
no .
no .
because ...
that would be a bad idea .
why ?
because i don &apos;t know what we are yet .
well , i don &apos;t either ,
but i &apos;m through delaying anything .
i &apos;ve looked back at my life , and every time
i didn &apos;t say something i meant
or waited for a better moment ...
i @-@ i should go anyway .
no , you &apos;re staying .
and they can just wait until i &apos;m done .
there is no better moment .
that &apos;s the one thing-- the only thing i &apos;ve discovered .
everything comes to an end .
there &apos;s no better moment than now .
mom , i need your help with the flowers .
alicia , we will talk .
okay .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s just a-- it &apos;s a little present .
really , it ...
it &apos;s nothing .
no , no , it ...
i &apos;m sorry , it ...
... really is nothing .
it &apos;s a deed to some land on mars .
they &apos;re selling it online ,
so you own 500 acres in the valles marineris .
seriously , mom , i can &apos;t get them all in .
it was meant to be a joke .
i &apos;m sorry . here .
mom !
i will call you .
wow , that is a lot of flowers .
hey , jason . hi .
do you want me to help you bring these in ?
oh , no , thanks , i think we &apos;re sending them back .
mom , the florist sent us funeral flowers .
they got our order mixed up with somebody else .
okay , uh ...
good luck . have a great party .
thanks , bye .
mom , they said that they knocked , but nobody answered ,
so they just left them here .
i think they knew they were the wrong ones .
mom ?
oh , my gosh , those are funeral flowers .
what are we gonna do ?
i told them that it was for grandma and howard &apos;s ...
what &apos;s it called ?
a ketubah signing .
it &apos;s like a wedding contract .
right , i think i called it a wedding reception .
well , we have an hour .
i have to get myself changed , get the food out , decorate .
let &apos;s get these inside and then you call the florist .
you don &apos;t think we could pass them off as celebratory , can we ?
like white for spring ?
it would be funny if we try .
i don &apos;t think funny &apos;s what we &apos;re going for .
exactly the man i wanted to see .
i thought i was meeting with mike .
you were . things have changed .
ignore me , this is dad &apos;s thing .
yeah , put your earbuds in .
‭ this is going to trial .
i know .
the governor doesn &apos;t want you to work on his case .
and part of our strategy is built on a speedy trial .
uh , peter needs to get back to work
and he can &apos;t do that with this ...
cloud ?
yes , yes , with this cloud hanging over him , so ...
i need your help .
you know i &apos;m not the best person to do this .
yes , i do ,
and that is why i need you .
i want you to prove that peter is guilty .
why ?
we &apos;re being offered a plea bargain by the ausa .
it makes no sense .
three years in prison ?
the evidence doesn &apos;t support it .
get the discovery .
i did , and i &apos;m not getting a straight answer
from peter &apos;s investigators--
they &apos;re being far too deferential--
so i need you to be tough .
show me why he &apos;s guilty .
hey , food &apos;s here . what &apos;s that ?
uh , nothing .
any luck with the flowers ?
no , they said that it &apos;s our fault .
that we &apos;ve ordered the bereavement array .
i said that there &apos;s a funeral somewhere that &apos;s getting flowers
that say , &quot; congratulations , howard and jackie . &quot;
you look really pretty .
why , thank you . so do you .
thank you .
let me see that . what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s a deed to land on mars .
why do you have a deed to land on mars ?
i have no idea .
it was a gift .
what , from a 13 @-@ year @-@ old ?
or 12 . maybe he was 12 years old .
&quot; the florrick homestead . &quot;
pretty weird gift , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , who gave it to you ?
someone from work .
i mean , 500 acres .
that &apos;s a lot of acres .
you &apos;re right .
it could &apos;ve been 50 acres .
you could ranch there .
i could raise a family .
hello ? mom ?
aw . thank you .
for what ?
for coming home for this .
and for wearing a tie .
it was a long weekend .
how &apos;s grandma doing ?
she &apos;s happy .
good .
grace .
we have funeral flowers .
we do . why ?
well , we thought we &apos;d go a different way .
okay , the guests are coming in ten minutes .
let &apos;s try and pull this together .
so , i have a surprise for you , mom .
oh , is it a deed to land on mars ?
what ?
nothing . your sister &apos;s in a funny mood .
what &apos;s the surprise ?
i can &apos;t tell you yet .
you &apos;re flunking out .
no .
you were snoring .
do we have a meeting ?
‭ nope . just dropped by .
here .
it &apos;s a donut .
i have another five hours of work tonight , jason .
whatever you want ,
can we do this another time ?
governor florrick .
you ?
they must be paying you well .
did he do it ?
you mean did he tank my prosecution
in order to satisfy one of his donors ?
sure , let &apos;s start with that . you tell me .
i had a strong case .
richard locke shoots his girlfriend patty
when she comes home one night .
two bullets in the chest .
look at the crime scene photos .
poor woman bled out .
how was the scene ?
untouched .
locke said he didn &apos;t do it ,
but he was covered in blood .
who ran the case ?
a detective from the 32nd .
uh ... crowell .
rick crowell ?
i know him .
yeah , he &apos;s not a cowboy .
so it was a slam @-@ dunk case .
till peter got involved .
see , he was the new state &apos;s attorney .
came in and started micromanaging
right from the start .
&quot; are you sure about the witnesses ? &quot;
&quot; was he properly mirandized ? &quot;
&quot; what about the blood ? &quot; &quot; are you sure ? &quot;
and were you sure ?
this shouldn &apos;t have been a mistrial .
richard locke should be in prison right now .
it was premeditated .
but you know what he is doing right now ?
he got married a month ago .
tough thing being rich .
yup , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s all broken up on the inside .
thanks .
go back to sleep .
promise me one thing .
what ?
don &apos;t get the governor off .
grace , that &apos;s the florist .
can you get that ?
we &apos;re here .
grace , my dear .
grandma &apos;s here ten minutes early !
well , traffic was so good .
and you never can tell if it &apos;s going to rain .
can i get a hit of that ?
how are you , mom ?
i &apos;m hunky @-@ dory .
you seem frazzled .
thanks . it &apos;s a good thing .
it &apos;s more real .
okay . to real .
just want to check my makeup .
grandma , they made a mistake . don &apos;t worry .
oh , my god , they are just beautiful .
you like them ?
why are we hiding them in the bedroom ?
sorry we &apos;re early , the traffic was light .
oh , you must be zach .
mom ?
grandma likes the flowers .
she &apos;s pulling them out into the living room .
i thought we had another ten minutes .
oh , hello .
you &apos;re grace , right ?
i &apos;m hannah mccreary .
is your brother ... ?
mom , i want you to meet my girlfriend , hannah .
i &apos;m so glad to meet you .
i loved that you stood by your husband .
a lot of people my age think it &apos;s a throwback
to an old kind of domesticity ,
but i think it &apos;s a harbinger of a new feminism .
like huma abedin , you know ?
women should do what they want ,
even if what they want is to stand by their man .
hannah &apos;s a proctor in my dorm .
really ?
i know i &apos;m older ,
but zach is older in maturity than he looks .
and sometimes compatibility is more a function
of intellectual reach than physical years , don &apos;t you think ?
you look relaxed .
upside of choosing unemployment .
what do you need ?
do you know jason crouse ?
i do . my old work .
he dropped by .
that &apos;s why i called .
he &apos;s investigating for peter florrick ,
the richard locke mistrial .
makes sense .
they &apos;re looking for a scapegoat .
that &apos;s what he said ?
no , that &apos;s what i know .
they &apos;re looking for someone to point a finger at .
well , it &apos;s not me .
are you sure ?
we were the prosecutors .
we dealt with the evidence .
we didn &apos;t tank it .
yeah , in my experience ,
whenever there &apos;s a battle between truth and power ,
truth loses .
so , how long have they been dating ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t even know that they were dating ; she &apos;s like 23 .
alicia , what are you doing in the kitchen ?
get some catering help .
mom ?
what are you doing here ?
jackie invited me .
and i drove her . mom can &apos;t drive anymore .
no , i chose not to .
where &apos;s the wine ?
wait , jackie invited you ?
why ? you guys hate each other .
oh , alicia , sometimes you &apos;re so innocent about women .
pour one for me , too .
she invited me
so she could lord it over me about her new husband .
i mean , this is how sick in the head your mother @-@ in @-@ law is .
she actually thought i &apos;d be jealous of howard .
hey , darling . ooh .
so , i heard you got into college .
yeah .
who &apos;s gonna be the smart one now , huh ?
and , alicia , empty nest--
that is coming up quickly for you , isn &apos;t it ?
alicia , do you think you have enough wine ?
have you seen them out there ?
they &apos;re all senior citizens .
we &apos;re gonna be the only ones drinking .
no , zach drinks , too , now .
what ? zach ? how old is zach ?
i thought he was just out of high school .
that &apos;s okay , children should learn to drink young .
italian kids drink right out of the crib , look at them .
sis , is there anything i should know ?
hey , thanks for doing this for mom .
can we talk for a minute ?
sure .
eli , how are you ?
marissa , you look beautiful .
thank you . i &apos;m dad &apos;s plus @-@ one .
thought i &apos;d class him up .
there was a misunderstanding .
so i talked to chris broccoli ,
and he had a suggestion .
neil ?
yeah , the divorce lawyer .
he suggested we do a one @-@ lawyer divorce
since it &apos;s amicable .
we don &apos;t have to use him if you want to agree on someone else .
one @-@ one @-@ one minute . thank you .
what do you think ?
i think that &apos;s ... smart .
good .
because i don &apos;t want to fight with you .
i know .
i don &apos;t want to either .
so zach brought a girlfriend here .
hannah .
really ?
she &apos;s 23 years old , she graduates this year .
should we be worried ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a college romance , they don &apos;t last long .
we were a college romance .
and look at us .
one second .
could you give us a moment ?
so ...
we &apos;re divorcing , then ?
we are .
do you feel sad ?
i do .
i guess it &apos;s just ...
... that &apos;s what happens .
yeah .
mom , i think you &apos;d better get out here !
what ?
l &apos;chaim !
to another marriage in the family .
congrats to zach and hannah .
alicia , why is he getting married ?
i don &apos;t know , mom ,
why don &apos;t you ask him ?
he &apos;d just say &quot; love . &quot;
you were like that when you were in college .
have you talked to her , the girlfriend ?
not much .
grace says she &apos;s 23 . he &apos;s 19 .
yes , and dad was eight years older than you .
no , he wasn &apos;t .
besides , it was
a totally different thing-- he was a man .
oh , my god .
where are you going ?
to talk to my son .
hi , kurt , diane , thank you for coming .
hi , it &apos;s so nice of you to do this .
well , howard is family now .
he is .
can we talk later ?
sure .
you &apos;re in an odd mood .
he &apos;s dropping out of school .
not forever , all right ?
i &apos;ll probably go back in a year or two .
you know it cost us $ 60,000
to put you in that school ?
and you &apos;ll save that money next year .
why ? why are you dropping out , zach ?
hannah got a job in france .
a good job as a translator .
he &apos;s moving to france .
and what are you going to do in france ?
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;ve been thinking about writing .
zach .
zach , come on . look at your mom .
it &apos;s insane .
i mean , who &apos;s gonna pay for this ?
hannah , she has a good job .
you &apos;re gonna let her pay for you ?
why not ? we &apos;re not as held up on the gender thing .
alicia ?
yeah ?
do you want to join us ?
sorry .
zach , face it .
this is the stupidest thing
i &apos;ve heard you say in a while .
thanks , mom .
and there have been some pretty stupid things .
all right , let &apos;s not go ...
you &apos;re gonna move to france with hannah
so you can be a househusband and write what ?
what are you gonna write , zach ?
a memoir .
i &apos;m in a memoir class .
okay , you know what ?
i love her , all right ?
and i &apos;m getting married and we &apos;re moving to france .
all right , wait a minute .
zach , we &apos;re your parents and we love you ,
but we want you to think about this .
well , we have one kid left .
i guess we shouldn &apos;t laugh at him .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i think you have to handle this ; i &apos;ve been drinking .
you &apos;re a good dad , you know ?
are you being funny ?
no , you are .
yeah , and look how well it turned out .
okay .
i &apos;ll talk to zach .
oh , and say what ?
&quot; je ne sais pas &quot; ?
go ahead , take it .
no .
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m away from my phone at the moment ,
so please leave a message .
‭ hey , alicia , it &apos;s me , i ...
i &apos;ve called you a couple times .
i know you &apos;re partying it up ,
but could you call me , please ?
um ... so ...
jason crouse .
detective rick crowell .
how &apos;s it going ?
overworked and underpaid .
i know the feeling .
so you were the first responder
at the richard locke crime scene .
i was .
bad case .
did you think that peter florrick micromanaged it ?
no .
best state &apos;s attorney we &apos;ve had in 20 years
and a hell of a governor .
and that has nothing to do with the fact
that you work private security for his campaign ?
no .
best state &apos;s attorney we &apos;ve had in 20 years
and a hell of a governor .
okay .
and , yes , it was odd he came to the crime scene ,
but i read nothing into that .
it &apos;s probably just irrelevant
that he wanted to double @-@ check all the blood collection .
thanks , rick .
i need a lawyer .
you had a whole suite of them . why me ?
i don &apos;t work there anymore .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
i &apos;m not .
and now you want to sue .
no , this is about the governor .
let &apos;s talk .
i &apos;m so glad that you find my life funny , mom .
i &apos;m not laughing now , zach .
i &apos;m asking a favor .
i &apos;m in love , mom .
you should be talking to hannah right now , not me .
try to figure out why i &apos;m in love with her .
i see you and dad rolling your eyes about her ,
she &apos;s not up to your standards , she ...
zach , let &apos;s make this simple , okay ?
your dad is on trial .
mom , don &apos;t guilt me with that .
zach , he &apos;s in trouble .
he could go to prison for three years .
just ...
don &apos;t move to france until it &apos;s over .
that &apos;s all i ask , okay ?
it &apos;s what you do for family .
this lab took a lot of flack over the richard locke case .
cost me a promotion .
i understand , ma &apos;am .
the blood spatter found at the crime scene ,
it was ...
processed correctly .
as was all the evidence , by me personally .
then i don &apos;t understand the problem .
there is no problem .
he just told me not to use it , that &apos;s all .
florrick ?
yes , florrick , the governor .
look , you want to spin this
to make it look like we screwed up ,
but he &apos;s the one who insisted
that the blood evidence was mishandled .
that would &apos;ve put locke away for 30 years ,
but florrick vetoed it .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . ask him .
but first ...
i &apos;d check the evidence log .
something &apos;s missing .
nice party .
so ...
jason called .
he said you weren &apos;t returning his calls .
i &apos;m throwing a party .
he thought it was more than that .
i told him i wanted to be with him .
all the time .
okay .
what did he say ?
he gave me a deed to mars .
i don &apos;t understand , is that a metaphor ?
he gave me a gift of a deed he bought online .
a deed to 500 acres ... on mars .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing anymore
or why i thought that i loved him .
it was a joke .
i &apos;m sure it was a joke .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know who he is .
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know anything about him .
then find out about him .
i think you &apos;re in his head .
he didn &apos;t sound like himself .
at least return his calls .
yeah , your mother wanted to drop out of college .
she wanted to go to india for a year .
seriously ?
ah , well , it was a different time .
no , she didn &apos;t .
mom , you &apos;re making that up .
i &apos;m not making it up .
you &apos;re not privy to every conversation
between mother and daughter , you know .
oh , there you are , veronica .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
drinking , i see .
yes .
it &apos;s the one way i have of dealing with that jealousy
over you having a husband , while i have none .
mom ...
oh , it &apos;s okay , owen .
some people deal with loneliness in different ways .
yes , that &apos;s me .
lonely .
and worrying about peter and alicia getting a divorce .
what ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , you didn &apos;t know ?
yes , your son and my daughter are getting a divorce .
they are not .
oh , yes , they are .
david lee told me , he &apos;s very upset that they didn &apos;t hire him .
mom , maybe now &apos;s not the right time .
grace , no , i @-@ i could be wrong .
you never know .
what does david lee say about this ? he can &apos;t agree to it .
he makes the same money .
and it &apos;s branding .
he understands branding .
an all @-@ female partnership ?
yes , congratulations .
congratulations .
you &apos;re getting a divorce ?
grandma says you &apos;re getting a divorce .
she heard it from david lee .
would you excuse me , diane ?
can we just talk here ?
why is everything always secrets in this family ?
zach , please .
eli .
where &apos;s peter ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m thinking of going to law school , what do you think ?
great . can @-@ can we talk later ?
it says &quot; well @-@ regulated militia . &quot;
actually , i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
oh , actually , i &apos;d like to talk to zach and grace alone .
no , anything you say to me , you can say to her .
no , thank you , though .
how long ago did you decide ?
a month ago .
and you &apos;re just now telling us ?
we weren &apos;t telling anyone .
we &apos;re not &quot; anyone , &quot; mom .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
we just wanted to get through dad &apos;s trial .
is this about jason ?
wait , who &apos;s jason ?
her investigator .
you have an investigator ?
well , her firm does .
so , this is about him ?
it isn &apos;t .
but ?
but what ?
it just sounded like you &apos;re going to say something else .
no , just ...
you &apos;re sleeping with him .
that is none of your business .
just like hannah &apos;s none of your business .
that &apos;s different .
how is it different ?
we think you &apos;re making a mistake .
you mean as opposed to you sleeping with your investigator ?
okay , this has nothing to do with you .
i &apos;m the parent here .
okay , you know what the difference is ?
i &apos;m getting married and you &apos;re getting divorced ,
and i &apos;m the one who &apos;s making the mistake ?
mom ?
actually , i didn &apos;t know that you would be out here .
i &apos;m here for eli , he asked me not to call .
oh , uh , i &apos;ll go get him .
wait .
i want to talk to you , too .
i @-@ i called you earlier .
yes , we &apos;ll talk .
i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll get eli .
first the groom signs the ketubah .
franklin delano roosevelt .
and the bride .
and the two witnesses .
mr. gold .
and ms. gold .
my two jewish friends .
how nice .
thank you , thank you .
bravo .
that was fast .
it wasn &apos;t hard ; nobody &apos;s hiding anything .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
peter micromanaged the case .
he went to the crime scene .
he did ? why ?
nobody knew .
he questioned all the evidence ,
he even vetoed some .
maybe it was bad evidence .
it was blood spatter from the apartment .
it showed that locke &apos;s story was a lie .
peter told the lab tech not to use it .
there &apos;s more .
the bullets that killed locke &apos;s girlfriend ?
they went missing from the crime lab .
peter was the last person to sign in .
okay , let me talk to him .
stay on it .
eli ?
could you ...
could you get alicia for me ?
i need to tell her something .
she &apos;s hosting .
i know , it &apos;ll just take a second .
this thing says i &apos;m supposed to give the bride
a couple of pieces of silver ,
just don &apos;t count on it .
hello .
mr. canning , what do you want ?
to play on the same team .
you know how we always do better when we fight the same fights .
and what fight are we talking about ?
well , i &apos;m representing cary agos in the peter florrick case ,
and i understand you represent eli gold .
and , um , you want to join forces ?
the more peter &apos;s old allies appear in lockstep against him ,
the more it keeps a spotlight on him .
it deflects culpability from our guys .
i call it &quot; the coalition of the innocent . &quot;
this isn &apos;t a good idea .
okay .
then let &apos;s go .
i can &apos;t .
i just want to talk .
tomorrow .
no .
tonight .
thank you .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t handle that well earlier ,
and then i came back here and it was awkward ,
and i know that if you have two awkward moments in a row ,
that it can be trouble clawing it back .
what are we clawing back ?
that thing that i gave you ...
the mars property ?
yeah .
see , i didn &apos;t know that i was coming here
and we were gonna have a serious conversation .
it was ...
it was in my pocket , and it was just supposed to be this ...
this fun thing .
i like space , i like stuff about space .
i get it .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;d better get back .
no , please wait .
i don &apos;t like spending more than a year in any one place ,
i like to be able to drop everything at a moment &apos;s notice
and just go .
then go , no one &apos;s stopping you .
you are .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
okay .
i think we need to clarify what we &apos;re saying here .
i want you , too .
you do ?
i do ,
but i am trying to explain to you that i can &apos;t be ...
stuck .
and i would make you feel stuck ?
no .
no , you just have this whole life here .
you have beautiful kids , a beautiful place ,
and a business .
and you want me to give that up ?
no .
no , i am just ... i &apos;m bringing up a problem .
i &apos;m not saying that there &apos;s a solution .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna repeat to you what i think i heard .
you want to go somewhere else and you want me to go with you ,
but not now , but at some point
when you get itchy about staying in one place ?
okay , i ...
i need to think on this .
so , do you know anyone here ?
a few .
so why law school ?
i thought you &apos;d be happy .
i don &apos;t know .
feels like a trick .
the law is exciting .
things move fast .
uh , no , they don &apos;t .
most of the law is just boring ...
paperwork and meetings .
hello ?
how rude .
answering your cell at a dinner party ?
oh , hi . um , yeah , i &apos;m standing right next to him . why ?
who is it ?
mike tascioni .
tom is sick .
why &apos;s he calling you ?
and why &apos;s he calling you about his dog ?
we &apos;ve grown close .
he couldn &apos;t get a hold of you .
what number is he trying ? = shh !
oh , no , that @-@ that &apos;s terrible .
uh ... okay , hold on .
tom had a nervous reaction to medication .
and he can &apos;t argue in court .
what ?
mike , what ?
you can &apos;t just ...
you &apos;re leaving us in the lurch ?
i don &apos;t care how sick your dog ...
he hung up on me .
eli , can i borrow you ?
i @-@ i &apos;m kind of in the middle of an emergency right now , diane .
listen , can cary agos hurt you
with this richard locke business ?
i just lost peter &apos;s trial lawyer .
i need your help .
see ? things do move fast .
why did you veto the blood spatter ?
what ?
the blood spatter at the richard locke crime scene .
it pointed to his guilt and you told the lab tech not to use it .
did you hire a new investigator ?
or is this from jason crouse ?
answer the question , peter .
why did you veto the blood spatter ?
the blood spatter was compromised
by the lab tech who collected it .
i was there , i saw it .
so , all of a sudden you decide to show up at a crime scene ?
what the hell were you thinking ?
listen , eli , this case was going to be scrutinized .
it was going to be our o.j. ,
so i went down there to get ahead of it .
except this lab tech walked right through the blood .
so i vetoed it .
because allowing it would &apos;ve lost us the trial .
and the bullets ?
you were the last person to sign for them .
yeah , like i said , this blood spatter was a royal screwup .
so i went down to look into this lab tech ,
and lo and behold ,
she had a whole string of similar screwups
going back two years .
so i hired someone else to check the ballistics .
who ?
kurt mcveigh .
god , i like watching you .
eat .
shoot .
just stand .
good thing i like being watched .
let &apos;s go home .
ten more minutes .
i don &apos;t want to be rude .
uh , jason , i need to talk to you .
it &apos;s important .
i did what i had to do .
i killed people that needed killing .
i know .
i know , not ...
not you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i told him to call ahead .
excuse me ?
i told zach he should call ahead ,
but he wanted to surprise you .
you hate me , don &apos;t you ?
no .
we are in love .
i know .
we &apos;re just worried that things are moving too fast .
how long have you known each other ?
a year .
do you really think that &apos;s ...
long enough to make the biggest commitment of your life ?
how long did you know each other before you got married ?
three years .
and now you &apos;re divorcing .
yes .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m concerned .
i don &apos;t want zach , or you ,
to go through what i am .
but that &apos;s the thing ,
we won &apos;t .
well , you don &apos;t know that .
no , i mean we won &apos;t go through all the ... mess .
it &apos;s just marriage .
my parents divorced ,
but they still see each other , they still love each other .
but they see other people , too .
marriage should work for us ,
not us for marriage .
if zach doesn &apos;t like france , he can leave me .
come back home , go to school .
if he meets someone else he loves more , then ...
why should i trap him ?
marriage should be fun , it shouldn &apos;t be this ...
weight ,
this death knell .
if it isn &apos;t permanent , then why get married at all ?
taxes .
forgive me , father ,
for i have sinned .
i have hurt so many people .
peter can explain everything .
i &apos;m sure he can .
he vetoed the blood splatter
because the lab tech botched the evidence collection .
turns out she has a history of sloppy mistakes .
why &apos;d he sign in at the lab ?
he was checking up on the tech .
and the missing bullets ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to ask , jason ,
are your feelings for alicia getting in the way of this ?
if you think so , feel free to fire me .
you know , you &apos;re right .
thank you .
you can send me your bill .
you must have one hell of a union .
excuse me ?
botched hair evidence in a 2011 rape trial ,
misidentified bite marks in a 2010 aggravated assault ,
and yet you still have a job .
what do you want , mr. crouse ?
i didn &apos;t do my homework before ,
but you have quite a history of sloppy mistakes
costing peter florrick convictions .
and you didn &apos;t tell me that you walked through the blood
at the richard locke crime scene .
there were at least a dozen cops in that apartment .
there was no room to maneuver ,
but i didn &apos;t lose those bullets .
did the ausa interview you ?
i &apos;m not talking anymore .
why are you setting florrick up ?
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
no , you are lying .
and you say that up on the stand ,
you will be charged with perjury .
are you threatening me ?
no .
i am just stating the facts , ma &apos;am .
next time you talk to the ausa ,
i &apos;d share that little fact .
mr. canning .
long time , no hear .
yes .
i miss you , alicia .
how &apos;s everything going for you ?
good , thank you .
and you ?
well , maybe you can help me .
i &apos;m representing cary agos ,
and i need to know if peter &apos;s gonna be loyal
to his former deputy ,
keep him out of this little legal mess or @-@ or not .
i have no idea , but i will pass on the message .
maybe i should be asking if he &apos;s gonna keep you out of it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;ve had a lot of interaction
with lloyd garber over the years .
you wrote him thank @-@ you notes for fund @-@ raisers .
okay .
and ?
you waived your spousal privilege
during the grand jury hearings ,
and , uh , if the prosecutor asks you
to testify about peter &apos;s relationship with lloyd garber ,
he could easily turn it around on you .
good @-@ bye , mr. canning .
which is why you need
to think about giving peter up .
and there &apos;s the last joke .
where are you , huh ?
where ?
okay , this is it . good night .
i didn &apos;t get to talk to you all evening .
tell me why i should be a lawyer in three words or less .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re smart .
okay , i &apos;ll take that .
we have to talk .
i know .
no , we really have to talk .
i know .
this is in case we die tomorrow .
okay , let &apos;s not die tomorrow .
see you at work .
firm of the amazons .
i like that .
thanks for everything .
you &apos;re welcome .
maybe one day you can teach me how to be happy .
not sure i can teach you anything .
i &apos;ve been drinking .
i can see that .
oh , you &apos;re such a good daughter .
i love you .
i love you , too .
and i &apos;m glad you &apos;re leaving him
and going with the hunk .
okay , mom . thanks .
i just want you to be happy .

where &apos;s owen ?
oh , i &apos;m here .
mm , i want you both to be happy .
you &apos;ll get her home safe ?
of course .
i love you .
i love you , too .
and i love you both .
it &apos;s the only good thing about me .
i love you both .
alicia .
thank you , it was beautiful .
jackie , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re happy .
but i won &apos;t be seeing you again .
why not ?
you &apos;re divorcing my son .
and i just wanted you to know ,
we &apos;re more alike than not .
good night and thank you .
this was , by far , the best ketubah signing
i &apos;ve ever been to .
good night , howard .
good night .
we &apos;re leaving , mom .
i know .
text me .
be good , please .
i will .
i don &apos;t want to die !
god !
mother !
no , you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m sorry !
that &apos;s not a plea bargain .
no , look , even if i were guilty ,
i &apos;d fight that , okay ?
did i miss zach ?
yeah , he left .
he said he &apos;d call you tomorrow .
is he going ?
to france ?
yeah .
yeah .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
no . don &apos;t .
it &apos;s his mistake , let him make it .
i &apos;m sorry .

i &apos;ll be out of your hair in a second .
don &apos;t worry .
