i &apos;m telling you , man .
they have the best .
they have the best pancakes on the island , hands down .
these pancakes are the bomb .
you know what it is ?
there ain &apos;t even a close second .
it &apos;s a combination of maple and this haupia ,
this coconut syrup they have .
that combo is crazy .
yeah .
you know what danny does ?
boysenberry .
‭ it &apos;s disgusting , right ?
‭ see ? it &apos;s so wrong .
can &apos;t have no fruit on top of pancakes .
the only fruit i &apos;m putting on top of my pancakes is coconut .
well , coconut &apos;s not a fruit . it &apos;s a drupe .
it &apos;s a what ?
a drupe . it &apos;s any fruit with an outer skin ,
pulpy middle and , uh , you know , seed inside of it .
i just remembered .
what &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t care .
&apos;cause i &apos;m eating pancakes , i &apos;m not writing a dissertation .
nice . you &apos;re welcome . i love that .
hey , speaking of old detective sunshine .
yeah ?
what &apos;d he go to vegas for ?
well , danny is actually , uh ,
chaperoning grace &apos;s cheerleading team to a competition .
you gonna make me choke on my food .
you mean to tell me
danny williams is down in vegas
with a bunch of 13 @-@ year @-@ old beliebers ?
oh , man , i wish i could go down there and see that .
well , you know what , i tried .
i checked grace &apos;s instagram ,
but she &apos;s got all her dad &apos;s buddies blocked .
so i couldn &apos;t see any pictures .
well , what the hell you think we got a crime lab for ?
you should get a techie right on that .
otherwise , williams is gonna skate from this scot @-@ free .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna call eric after breakfast .
that &apos;s right .
the minute i walk out of here ,
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m gonna call the kid .
that &apos;s a good idea .
one more thing .
not that it &apos;ll ever come up ,
but if my wife asks , you don &apos;t tell her i had this stuff .
you tell her that i had the diet plate .
that &apos;s the turkey burger with no bun
and a scoop of cottage cheese .
why would your wife ask me that question ?
why the hell would the red sox sell babe ruth for $ 5,000 ?
i don &apos;t know !
don &apos;t ask me to explain marriage to you .
i just need to know you got my back .
uh , yeah , of course . okay .
of course i got your back .
here you go .
thank you , thank you very much .
you &apos;re welcome .
i got you , man .
what just happened ?
did steve mcgarrett just pick up a check ?
that &apos;s correct .
what , you win the powerball or something ?
you feeling okay ?
yeah .
‭ i &apos;m gonna call an ambulance .
you don &apos;t look too good .
oh , that &apos;s not necessary .
you are forgetting something , though .
what ?
you owe me 20 bucks .
for what ?
the bulls @-@ clippers game , last week .
and frankly , lou ,
i got to say i &apos;m a little disappointed
that i have to ask for it .
see , i &apos;m sitting here thinking you just my man ,
so you &apos;re gonna buy me breakfast .
that &apos;s all right . no , that &apos;s okay .
hey , let me see that . i am paying for breakfast .
thank you . with my money .
no , correction , correction .
this was your money .
i won it in a bet .
now it &apos;s my money .
you are welcome .
see how that works ?
yeah .
thanks , chef .
cheapskate .
good morning , ona .
good morning , commander .
you look beautiful this morning .
you &apos;ve been saying the same line to me for six years .
and i meant it every time .
i thought you navy boys were all action .
you just talk a good game .
excuse me , ona .
what about your change ?
it was weird , man .
he went outside , talked to this guy ,
then just disappeared .
you try his cell phone ?
yes , it &apos;s going straight to voicemail .
he &apos;s not responding to texts , either .
all right , what about renee ?
tried her , too . twice .
no answer .
yeah , i &apos;m sure everything is fine .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not . you didn &apos;t see what i saw , okay ?
that conversation that lou was having ,
it was pretty heated .
all right , well , what about the other guy ?
you recognize him ?
no , i never seen him before ,
but i could tell lou definitely knew him .
hey , chin , hold on a second .
i got kono .
go , kono . you got me and chin . go ahead .
i just pinged grover &apos;s cell .
looks like he &apos;s at home .
if he &apos;s at home ,
then why isn &apos;t he picking up his phone ?
chin , meet me there .
lou ?
renee ?
welcome back to sunrise .
you know , so many people are talking about those huge waves
that are coming in to the north shore .
lou ?
steve ?
up here .
tell me the front door wasn &apos;t open when you got here .
what do we got ?
dust void .
it &apos;s the shape of a suitcase .
found the same thing in will &apos;s room .
this family strike you as the type
to have go @-@ bags under their beds ?
bring your phones !
come on , give me your phone .
they &apos;re going off the grid .
but why ? what could &apos;ve happened ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m thinking whatever that guy told lou
outside the coffee shop , spooked him enough to run .
and they were ready for it .
go straight to the truck . don &apos;t stop .
anything ?
still no word .
yeah , we checked with the kids &apos; schools .
both of them were no @-@ shows this morning .
okay , well , the gps in the family car has been disabled ,
so they &apos;re definitely in the wind .
what about the , uh , mystery man outside the coffee shop ?
nothing on the traffic cams ,
but check out lou &apos;s phone records .
okay , so the last entry
is an incoming text 7 : 52 a.m.
okay , that &apos;s exactly when we left the wailana .
just two words .
&quot; it &apos;s time . &quot; that &apos;s it .
that make any sense to you ?
no . who sent the text ?
it &apos;s registered to frank zagar .
philadelphia area code .
philly ?
run it through ncic , see what we get .
it says he &apos;s fbi .
that &apos;s the guy .
that &apos;s the guy that was outside the wailana .
what would a fed want with lou ?
maybe he &apos;s in trouble .
well , if he is , why wouldn &apos;t he call us ?
where we gonna go ?
we just have to get off the island .
that &apos;s all .
what if they find us ?
nobody is gonna find us .
we &apos;re just doing this to be safe .
mom ?
sweetheart , you heard your father .
this is just a precaution .
then why do we have to leave the island ?
why can &apos;t we just move to another town ?
because if they find us , they &apos;re gonna kill us .
would you stop it ?
will , that &apos;s not true .
your father would never let anything happen to us .
that &apos;s right .
nobody &apos;s hurting anybody in this car , okay ?
i can promise you that .
all right , listen , family . i know this is difficult .
but we have to remember
that we knew that this day might come .
the most important thing right now
is that we all stick together .
and stop scaring your sister .
what does the fbi want with lou grover ?
special agent zagar &apos;s working on his relocation .
what are you talking about , relocation ?
he &apos;s relocating my guy ?
why would he be doing that ?
your guy was a high @-@ value asset in an important
undercover case that went down back in &apos; 89 .
agent zagar was his handler .
so all this is blowback for that op ,
and now lou &apos;s on the run ?
we believe so .
all right , i need to speak with agent zagar .
commander , you know the protocol .
this is a dark extraction .
grover &apos;s been compromised .
you &apos;re just gonna have to trust
that agent zagar has the situation under control now .
i &apos;m sorry , but there &apos;s nothing more i can do .
yeah , right .
thanks for taking our call .
does he really expect us to sit back and do nothing
while lou and his family run for their lives ?
well , if the fbi can &apos;t help us ,
i know somebody who can .
how you doing , honey ? you all right ?
i will be .
once we get to where we &apos;re going .
i knew what i signed up for when i married you .
renee , i know you did , but the kids ...
the kids never had a choice .
no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t put all this on your shoulders .
it isn &apos;t your fault .
you &apos;re a good wife .
i love you .
i know .
i love you , too .
all right , you gotta get back in the truck .
i don &apos;t want the camera to see your face .
how &apos;s your family holding up ?
well , frank ...
they &apos;re having their lives uprooted
for the second time in less than three years .
i don &apos;t know . what do you think ?
lou , we &apos;re going to make this transition
as smooth as possible .
we &apos;re gonna do everything we possibly can to insure their safety .
you got my word on that .
thanks .
&quot; sean darius . &quot;
looks like that was lou &apos;s deep cover alias .
multiple arrests for criminal assault ,
manslaughter , armed robbery ...
bureau put together a pretty impressive rap sheet .
yep . it had to be impressive ,
so he &apos;d be attractive to these guys .
this is the philly black mafia .
according to joe white &apos;s contact ,
these guys were a street gang
who controlled vice , drugs , even some cops .
the fbi put together a task force ,
went in , dismantled them from the inside out
using undercovers .
okay , but how does a chicago cop
end up in an fbi op in philly ?
well , the bureau pulled lou
fresh out of the academy in chicago .
actually , it &apos;s a perfect choice .
no one would know lou in philly .
right .
and once the op was over ,
lou went back to chicago and resumed his life .
why didn &apos;t he tell us ?
well , probably too worried about retribution .
in the back of his mind ,
he had to know that was possible .
that &apos;s why he kept his bags packed .
right .
so the question now is , &quot; who caught up to him ? &quot;
all right , well ...
this is an organizational chart of the command structure ,
which ultimately consisted of these 12 guys .
now , most of these guys are either dead or still in prison .
but these two ...
these two had the most to lose .
now , that is aaron barnes and his son , aaron jr .
when the old man went away ,
it was the philly equivalent of taking down john gotti .
well , it says here that barnes sr. died in prison ,
but his son was released last year .
correct .
okay , so junior gets out of prison
looking for revenge .
it takes him a little while ,
but eventually he tracks lou down .
okay , but how ? how ?
if we didn &apos;t know about this , who did ?
oh , man .
what ?
frank , i just picked up a unit .
what do you want me to do ?
pull over .
i thought we weren &apos;t stopping for anybody .
just pull over .
stay put . let me handle it .
copy .
oh , lou , honey ...
baby , relax .
it &apos;s just hpd .
doesn &apos;t mean a thing , renee .
barnes can get to anybody .
nobody talks but me .
how you doin &apos; , officer ?
captain grover , are you okay ?
yes , sir . why ? what &apos;s the problem ?
five @-@ 0 has an alert out for you .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
will you please step out of the vehicle ?
that &apos;s not happening , officer .
go . i &apos;ll meet you at the extraction point .
over to the car , now . hands on the hood .
you said we were going to the airport .
we are going to the airport , little mama ,
we &apos;re just taking off from moloka &apos;i .
okay , and flying to where ?
we &apos;re going to utah .
we &apos;re going to provo , utah .
seriously ? utah ?
it &apos;s not forever , honey . just take it down .
it &apos;s okay .
dad ...
yes , son ?
when this is all over , we can come back to hawaii , right ?
dad , i &apos;m starting shortstop this year .
you really don &apos;t get it , do you ?
we &apos;re never coming back .
don &apos;t say that to your brother .
you don &apos;t even know that ...
did i say that ?
you didn &apos;t have to !
stop ! stop it ! that &apos;s enough .
look ...
this family has been through tough times before
and we know how to deal with it .
and the way we do that
is just what your father said :
by sticking together .
look at me .
look at ... will , baby ,
look at me .
will ...
we are going to love and support each other
no matter where we live , what school we go to
and what position we play on the baseball team , baby .
come on , now .
the only team that matters right now is this team .
right here .
in this car .
you understand me ?
good .
okay . all right .
what &apos;d you do ?
bought us some time .
not much .
thanks , buddy .
let &apos;s go .
come on .
will , help your mother with her back .
okay .
yeah , get me my bag ?
all right .
thank you .
come on , little mama , let &apos;s go .
watch your step .
oh , thank you .
i got it .
go on inside , little mama .
guys , an hpd officer
spotted grover on the 83 .
he pulled him over ,
he gets jumped by a guy resembling agent zagar ,
who then cuffs him to the cage in the backseat of the patrol car ,
leaves him there .
why would grover and zagar evade hpd ?
if anything , they could help him out .
well , i would do exactly the same thing .
in a situation like this , you never know who you can trust .
what about barnes ?
we got any leads on him yet ?
no , not yet . but we think we may have found out
how grover was compromised .
take a look at this .
we ran the phone records of everyone
with known ties to aaron barnes jr . ,
including his attorney , benjamin rusk .
now check out this phone call .
collect , from marion , illinois .
there &apos;s a federal prison there .
yes , and within 24 hours , rusk shows up for a visit .
okay , who &apos;d he see ?
well , that &apos;s the point .
rusk doesn &apos;t have a client in marion .
he had a sit @-@ down with clay maxwell .
clay maxwell gave up grover .
i had the prison send over the visitor logs .
rusk met with maxwell for 20 minutes
and then he got on a flight right back to philly .
and the next day , philly pd surveillance unit
confirmed that rusk met with barnes jr .
so this whole thing ,
this whole thing is about payback .
son of a bitch .
clay turns on grover
because grover had him arrested in chicago .
&quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
my father used to tell me that
when things got tough .
you know what it means ?
that someday things will get better .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
listen ... i grew up in north philly .
i @-@ it &apos;s kind of a rough part of town .
there were gangs , fights after school almost every day .
my @-@ my father ...
uh , he drove a truck .
you know ? so he wasn &apos;t always around to protect me .
but he gave me this , and he said ,
&quot; when you &apos;re alone , this &apos;ll make you feel safe &quot; &quot;
and ...
he was right .
i was thinking maybe you could hold onto this for me .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
this private charter left philly nine hours ago .
there was no passenger manifest
and the pilot won &apos;t respond to atc .
barnes could be on that plane .
based on descent rate and glide path ,
it &apos;s heading for a private airstrip
on the north shore ,
used primarily for agricultural planes-- you know , crop dusters .
how long until they &apos;re wheels down ?
based on current airspeed , it could be less than an hour .
come down slowly ! hands where we can see &apos; em !
got him ?
yeah .
it &apos;s empty . go and check the cargo hold .
stay here .
where is everybody ?
where are all your passengers ?
they paid me to fly here empty .
no passengers , no payload .
‭ who ? who paid you ?
a man named barnes . he arranged the charter .
cargo hold &apos;s empty .
there &apos;s no one aboard the plane .
this was the decoy .
then where the hell &apos;s barnes ?
so , these are agents kheel and strauss .
they &apos;re on loan from the honolulu field office .
this is captain lou grover . it &apos;s his family .
renee , samantha , will .
gentlemen . thank you so much .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i appreciate
what you &apos;re doing for me and my family .
thank you .
all right , guys .
watch your step , but we got to move .
airstrip &apos;s on the other side of the island .
okay , come on , let &apos;s go . give me your bag .
oh , thank you , baby .
all right , kids , let &apos;s go .
lou ?
baby ?
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
you kids buckled up back there ?
yeah .
of course .
good , hang onto something .
lou , honey , what are you doing ?
honolulu field office , my ass .
those two guys look like they &apos;ve been living underground .
there &apos;s not a tan line on either one of them .
oh , my god ! we &apos;re gonna die !
girl , please , i told you .
didn &apos;t i tell you
that nothing &apos;s happening to anybody here in this car ?
dad ! dad , tree ! tree !
what ? ! what ? no !
you ... do you think zagar knows ?
does he know ?
baby , he &apos;s in on it .
what ?
go ! go ! go ! go ! go !
thank you .
duke , where are they ?
over there .
that dozer operator was leveling the area when he found them .
head shots . they were executed .
are we 100 % on these i.d. &apos; s ?
yeah , we ran a fingerprint scan .
they both came out fbi
out of the honolulu office .
agents kheel and strauss .
so you &apos;re telling me that
agent zagar and the fbi &apos;s relocating grover and his family ,
and now two agents show up murdered ?
you think barnes is taking out zagar &apos;s detail ?
i don &apos;t know .
chin ?
steve , i &apos;m looking at another private plane
that departed from pittsburgh about two hours
after our pilot left philly .
it &apos;s the same situation .
they &apos;ve cut off all radio communication .
where &apos;s it heading ?
looks like moloka &apos;i .
they &apos;re on track to land there in about ten minutes .
if barnes is on that plane and he &apos;s heading for moloka &apos;i ,
we got to assume that &apos;s where agent zagar
is taking grover and his family .
daddy , they &apos;re behind us !
i see &apos; em , little mama .
everybody , hold tight !
get ahead of it . cut &apos; em off .
lou !
five @-@ 0 !
we &apos;re gonna need a chopper !

copy .
let &apos;s go .
tree !
daddy !
what &apos;s the matter ?
put your head down.kids , get low--
everybody get down and stay down !
let &apos;s go !
steve , a plane just landed
on a private strip near ha &apos;upu bay .
i &apos;m trying to get a satellite reposition ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time .
all right .
looks like we &apos;re gonna do this the old @-@ fashioned way .
lou !
whew . yeah ...
you okay ? baby ?

yeah .
that &apos;s it , everybody . end of the line .
car &apos;s no good .

tire tracks .
watch your step .

it &apos;s all clear .
over there .
i got the plane .
no sign of barnes .
they can &apos;t have gotten too far .
yeah .
you &apos;re late .
he made us .
no , no .
he didn &apos;t make us .
he made you .
if you lose him , it &apos;s your damn problem .
i paid you a lot of money to deliver this guy .
i &apos;ll get him , mr. barnes .
this is a temporary situation .
grover &apos;s just one man dragging
his wife and kids through the jungle .
he won &apos;t get far .
you better be right .
let &apos;s split up .
come with me .
i got a building on the left , steve .
i see a smokestack .
looks like an old sugar mill .
two suvs in the front .
got to be barnes .
hold on , i &apos;m gonna peel off
so they don &apos;t see us .
stay on me . come on , keep moving .
come on , kids , i know you &apos;re tired ...
i know you &apos;re tired , but you got to keep moving .
come on , short stuff , let &apos;s go .

sit down , you can rest for a little bit , all right ?
but don &apos;t get comfortable ,
because we &apos;re gonna be moving again soon .
not you .
what ?
listen .
what ?
there &apos;s no way in the world we &apos;re gonna be able
to outrun zagar and his men .
well , what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna have to do something
that they &apos;re not gonna expect us to do , okay ?
renee , i need you to stay here with the kids .
no , no ... - look , renee , this is life and death .
hold that pistol like you know how to hold it .
now , you know how to use that thing , right ?
you remember .

center mass .
