should we all expect christmas gifts that are stolen from your office ?
you shouldn &apos;t .
speaking of christmas ....
since monica and i are starting a new business and have no money ...
... this year we could do secret santa
and each only buy one gift.and there &apos;s the added mystery of who gets who .
who gets whom .
i don &apos;t know why i do that .
but it is correct .
hey , what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s all of your names.let &apos;s pick .
hey , what &apos;s going ?
no , joey , stay .
we &apos;re picking names for secret santa .

i &apos;m going to take a nap . turkey makes me sleepy .
we haven &apos;t eaten yet .
i know , but all that work you &apos;re doing to get it ready and ....
did you pick rachel for your secret santa ? i &apos;ll trade for her .
i picked her . thank god , you want her !
why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?
she exchanges every gift she gets.it &apos;s impossible to get her something she likes .
come on , let &apos;s trade !
i got her that backpack and she loved it .
i remember she cried when that big dog ran off with
there was no big dog .
this sucks ! i already got her a briefcase with &quot; r.g. &quot; put on it .
her initials .
okay , i &apos;m really bad at initials .
you got your shopping done early .
yeah , well , my camel cash was about to expire .
maybe you can give it to somebody else .
like ross geller !
you know what ? it &apos;s a girlie briefcase .
who cares ! he works in a museum .
the big game &apos;s about to start !
you don &apos;t have to do that
ross and joey aren &apos;t here . you can watch the parade if you want.thanks.
what is wrong with this freezer ?
what happened ?
lce just got in my eye !
people are trying to sleep in here !
monica got ice in her eye and it hurts !
open it up . let me see .
i can &apos;t . it really kills .
maybe you should put some ice on it .
lt looks bad .
we should take you to a doctor .
no , my eye doctor is richard !
i can &apos;t go to him when i don &apos;t have a boyfriend .
he &apos;s really picky about his patients .
you &apos;ve got to go . what &apos;s his office number ?
like i remember his office number !
speed dial seven .
i &apos;m calling on behalf of monica geller &apos;s eye .
is richard burke in today ?
he &apos;s not in . will she see the on @-@ call doctor ?
yes .
she &apos;s very excited about that !
okay , we &apos;ll be right in .
okay , so who &apos;s gonna take her in ?
i &apos;ll go , you can watch your parade .
it &apos;s so cool . till monica gets back , i &apos;m head chef .
and i get to make all the decisions .
she told you to follow the recipe exactly .
get out of my kitchen .
i think i &apos;m making some progress with joey .
when i walked in , he went to his bedroom ... but he only slammed the door once .
yeah , he gave me the finger while doing it .
i &apos;ve got to call my mom and ask her a left @-@ handed cooking question .
i &apos;m gonna be in there.while i &apos;m gone ....
chandler , you &apos;re in charge .
i picked monica for secret santa ,
but i &apos;m getting her something for hanukkah.you want to switch ?
i was trying to trade ... for you .
really ? that &apos;s so nice . what are you getting me ?
i don &apos;t know , r.g. i was thinking something girlie for your office .
maybe phoebe will switch with me .
then you &apos;ll get stuck with rachel , and she exchanges every gift .
no , i got her lots of stuff she never took back .
like ?
like that gold necklace i got her last year .
when did she wear it last ?
she wore it all christmas day and then ....
big dog ?
what are you doing ?
sending back this stuff chandler bought .
even the tv ?
no , i &apos;ll put that in my room .
listen , joey . i know what he did was wrong .
but can &apos;t you hear him out ?
back when you and rachel were together ,
if chandler had kissed her , would you hear him out ?
that &apos;s a good point .
how long you going to punish him ? five years .
you &apos;ve sentenced him ? don &apos;t do the crime if you can &apos;t do the time .
the guy &apos;s your best friend.was my best friend .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re pushing for him .
with him out of the way as my best friend , there &apos;s a spot open .
who , me ?
yeah .
i &apos;m honored . you know what i &apos;m going to do as your best friend ?
i &apos;m going to get you to talk to chandler .
all right .
but if you weren &apos;t my best friend ....
oh , my god . is it really that bad ?
i walk in the room , and he won &apos;t talk to me .
he just mumbles something in ltalian .
and i know he only knows the bad words .
i &apos;m so , so sorry . i feel responsible .
it &apos;s not your fault .
gunther , have you seen chandler ?
i thought you were chandler .
but one of you is over there .
hey , joe .
i &apos;ll be right with you . thanks , wendy .
oh , my god ! how cute is the on @-@ call doctor ?
so cute that i &apos;m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye .
you have the best luck with eye doctors .
i know .
dr. burke will see you now .
oh no @-@ no @-@ no , not dr. burke . dr. burke is out of town . the @-@ the on @-@ call doctor will see me now .
dr. richard burke is out.dr. timothy burke , his son , will see you now .
ready ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry . that
where you going ?
my folks &apos; .
when you coming back ?
i don &apos;t know . i might stay there while i look for an apartment .
what ?
yeah , you know at first i thought we could talk about this y &apos;know , work it out ,
seeing you two together , i don &apos;t think i ...
what do you want me to say ? should i stop seeing her ?
it &apos;s not about her . okay ?
but seeing you together reminds me of what you did .
i won &apos;t live with someone who doesn &apos;t know what it is to be a friend .
so , i &apos;ll see ya .
i know what it is to be a friend . i screwed up .
yeah , you did .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m leaving .
if you &apos;re not going to stay for me , then at least stay for them .
they had a very difficult year . what with the robbery and all .
and that chick used to be very cute .
when that guy was robbing us ... and i was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours ...
... do you know what i was doing in there all the time ? i was thinking about how i let you down .
if i knew what kind of friend you &apos;d be , i wouldn &apos;t have worried .
see you around !
wait one second ! there has to be something that i can do .
if we still had that unit .... i &apos;d get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down .
what ?
we got a box .
i remember the last time i saw you.it was the morning i left for college .
you were standing outside the dairy queen .
just probably waiting for it to open .
you look great now .
you look great too .
you &apos;re an excellent patient .
how does it look ?
you have a scratch on your cornea . you have to wear a patch .
like a pirate ?
if that helps you .
how long have you been working with your dad ?
come on , one of us had to mention him .
i moved back here a couple months ago .
big family dinner tonight ?
no way !
i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriend &apos;s .
but we broke up .
she wasn &apos;t ready for a serious commitment .
so you made her walk the plank , aye , matey ?
you &apos;re not wearing the patch yet .
i know .
he &apos;s coming here for thanksgiving ?
i know . it &apos;s sick .
why is it sick ?
it &apos;s richard &apos;s son !
it &apos;s like inviting a greek tragedy over for dinner .
if it were greek , i &apos;d be blind in both eyes .
i like him because he &apos;s handsome and he &apos;s nice and smart and handsome .
phoebe , you understand , don &apos;t you ?
i could see where i &apos;d be your best shot , but no .
sorry , honey . i think it &apos;s twisted .
what &apos;s twisted ?
me going out with richard &apos;s son .
it sounds like a really bad idea to me .
ls he okay in there ?
he &apos;s fine !
if things work out between you and richard &apos;s son .... you can tell your kids ...
... that you slept with their grandfather .
judge all you want to .
married a lesbian , left a man at the altar , loved a gay ice dancer
... threw a girl &apos;s wooden leg in the fire , live in a box !
what exactly is the point of the box ?
the meaning of the box is threefold .
one , it gives me the time to think about what i did .
two , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey .
and three ... it hurts .
and if he stays in the box you guys will be friends again ?
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s a start .
remember that necklace i gave you last year ? can i see it ?
why ? i just want to check something .
okay .
now we &apos;ll see .
air hole ! air hole !
here it is . i love it . i wear it all the time .
the necklace i got you was gold . this is silver .
well , maybe ... it changed .
oh , my god ! you actually exchanged it .
isn &apos;t it better to exchange it for something i enjoy ... and can use a lot ?
what did you get ? credit .
i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it .
hi , tim .
thank you . come meet my friends .
phoebe .
and joey .
my brother , ross .
and rachel .
that &apos;s chandler.how do you do ?
what &apos;s ?
well , he &apos;s ....
he &apos;s doing some thinking .
what happened ?
you kissed my girlfriend !
i like those sunglasses .
&quot; like them &quot; like them ? or &quot; i &apos;d like to get store credit &quot; like them ?
this turkey is ready .
where can i wash up ? let me show you .
the towels are hanging next to the sink .
and you can use the fancy soap .
thank you .
fancy soap ? i thought we were saving that for the pope .
see . he &apos;s nice , right ?
do you want a relationship where you can actually say :
&quot; that &apos;s not how your dad used to do it &quot; ?
everything looks great . where should i sit ? saved you a seat .
sick , sick , sick , sick .
i &apos;ll get it .
got you !
that doesn &apos;t sound like thinking to me .
sorry !
you shouldn &apos;t be talking at all .
you &apos;ve got too much thinking to do to be talking and joking .
okay , you got it !
ross , pass me the yams ?
joey &apos;s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them .
will you stop ! what &apos;s the matter with you ?
we &apos;ve got company .
nothing &apos;s the matter with me .
i &apos;m not completely devoid of sentiment . i have feelings .
okay , fine .
you can &apos;t see , but i &apos;m breaking the tension by mooning you guys .
all right , look !
if this is a big joke to you , forget about it .
this means something to me .
if it doesn &apos;t mean anything to you , then get out of there.otherwise , you &apos;re just an idiot in a box .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
this means a lot to me.i want to be friends again .
i swear i won &apos;t say another word tonight .
so you &apos;ll take this seriously ?
absolutely !
that sounds like another word to me .
are you going to take this seriously ?
okay !
don &apos;t say that i have no sentiment .
this is a movie stub from our first date .
this eggshell is from the first time you made me breakfast in bed .
this is from the museum , the first time we ...
... were together .
maybe i exchange gifts sometimes , but i keep the things that matter .
i don &apos;t know what to say . i &apos;m sorry .
though you &apos;re not supposed to take these .
it &apos;s , like , a million years old .
we actually have people looking for that .
mind if i smoke ?
care if i die ?
no , i &apos;m just kidding , i &apos;m just kidding . go ahead , smoke .
this always happens.here , let me .
thank you .
you have very beautiful ... eye .
my friends think this is weird.even the one in the box ?
it &apos;s not weird , is it ?
i thought it would be . i almost canceled , but it really isn &apos;t .
i know . me and your dad , that &apos;s totally separate .
i totally agree .
we &apos;re two people who find each other ... very attractive.right ?
what ?
nothing , nothing .
no , really . was that not okay ? no , that was good .
that was a good kiss .
lt reminded you of
don &apos;t say it !
lt did , didn &apos;t it ?
yes !
i know !
god , i am sorry . i am so sorry .
it &apos;s okay . it wouldn &apos;t be thanksgiving without a little emotional scarring .
you know what &apos;s even worse ? my friends were right .
you know what &apos;s worst for me is you remind me of a younger version of my mom .
i want you to know how sorry i am
it &apos;s okay .
chandler &apos;s the one i &apos;m mad at .
well , i &apos;m still sorry .
ls he here ?
ln the box .
he can &apos;t talk right now .
why not ? what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s trying to show joey how much he means to him .
by being in a box ?
joey had reasons .
they were threefold .
you not being able to talk might make this easier .
listen ....
i don &apos;t want to be someone who comes between two best friends .
i can &apos;t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.and i don &apos;t want to be the cause of that .
i don &apos;t think we can see each other anymore .
i &apos;m going to my mom &apos;s in chicago.i &apos;m going to stay there for a while .
i think this could have been something really amazing .
but , you know , this is probably for the best .
you know ?
i &apos;m going to miss you .
goodbye , chandler .
open the box !
what ? he can still catch her . get out of there ! get out of there !
we &apos;re going to be fine . get out !
you did some real good thinking in there .
i mean , this is ....
you could still catch her !
and merry christmas from your secret santa !
all right , who got chandler ? because i need to trade .
he sees her !
he &apos;s catching up to her .
she sees him !
they &apos;re hugging !
he &apos;s taking her purse .
that &apos;s not them.i &apos;ll go call the police .
there they are !
all right , get a room .
