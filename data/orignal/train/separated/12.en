第五季 第二十一集
Paisley Group already leads the other Fortune 500 companies
in the global and industry trend toward consumer use of green products,
while providing competitive advantages
in efficacy and safety.
Now, this doesn't mean...
Not now. Not ever.
Ah... sounds like our protestor friends agree with us.
Now is not the time for brunch.
All right. In short,
the merger of our two great companies
will ensure our competitive edge.
But more important,
for the pension funds you manage;
it'll mean a greater return on your investments.
Now... are there any questions?
Yeah. Mr. Paisley.
How much domestic workforce
would you anticipate shedding as a result of this merger?
You sound like one of the protestors out there.
Regrettably, it could be as much as 20 percent stateside.
We're gonna hope to hold to that line.
What about the wrongful termination suit
by your former CFO?
Well, I'm not stupid.
I'll leave that to my lawyer.
Yes. We're confident that this suit has no merit...
He's claiming he was fired because he was gay.
Yes. He's claiming that.
Kyle Musset was fired for cause.
He was attempting to sell trade secrets to a competitor...
If the suit drags on...
it could hang over the stock price.
Well, we're in negotiations now and we're confident
that this suit will set...
Down with corporate imperialism!
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be fun?
Mr. Canning, hello.
Alicia's just a few minutes behind you.
So, this is what a start-up looks like.
Yep. 35 employees. Seven partners.
$21 million in yearly billing.
Another $5 million and you'll be able to
afford doors for your conference room.
It's a design choice.
Yeah, the design choice
that lets other people listen in on your meetings.
Lindsay, can you get my sweater from m...?
Oh. Mr. Canning.
We ready to put this to bed?
Yeah. I'm ready for court, uh...
I think we just honor our trial date tomorrow.
My goodness, what happened to you?
Or is that, uh, another design choice?
Excuse me.
It was a mishap.
We, uh, considered your client's latest demands...
and, um, our top offering is $150,000.
We'll take our chances in court.
Good. That was quick.
Good to see you.
He was fired because he was gay.
How's that gonna go over with your fund managers?
Like extortion. You're lucky to get $150,000.
$200,000.
No. $140,000.
You have changed.
Yes. I have.
I liked the old Alicia better.
The $200,000 Alicia?
All right, fine. I'll talk to my client,
you talk to your... corporate overlord and then, uh...
in the meantime, get that cleaned up,
cause, it's gonna leave a stain.
Yeah. Thanks.
Finn. What's up?
Hey. Alicia, I'm sorry, am I early?
For?
Eli.
We have a meeting about the governor's announcement.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.
You okay?
Oh, yeah. Someone hit me with a pie.
It's a long story.
Good news. Great news.
Where can we talk? How about your desk?
I got an early copy.
Comes out tonight and it couldn't be more perfect.
Eli, what is it?
Oh, Alicia, maybe you shouldn't look.
It's the report on the Jeffrey Grant shooting.
No, I'm fine, Eli. What's it say?
Well, it clears Finn of any wrongdoing...
What happened to your...
Pie. What's it say, Eli?
It clears Finn of any responsibility
for the shooting and lays the blame firmly
at the feet of the state's attorney.
That's good.
It's great. How'd you get pie on you?
So, Peter will reference it in his public endorsement?
Yes. Now here's the thing--
this is the most dangerous time for you.
Because Castro will try to strike back.
He'll try and undercut this report by exposing something on you.
Well, that's good, there is nothing on me.
Your sister's overdose,
your wife's miscarriage.
What's wrong with my wife's miscarriage?
You divorced her after the miscarriage...
Eli.
Why don't we do this another time?
I didn't divorce her.
Oh, come on, you don't understand.
This is not about the facts.
It's what the facts can be made to look like.
What do you need, Eli?
Castro is gonna try and get in touch with you
with whatever he has-- a photo, a Xerox,
something from your past. Bring it to me.
Whatever it is, it'll make you angry,
but bring it to me. Okay?
Okay.
Good.
I'm gonna go.
I still can't get used to this place.
You need more walls.
Well, he's a barrel of laughs.
Yes, he takes his job very seriously.
And there's no one better at it.
Look, I-I'd advise against court.
I just... - ...has happened 14 separate times.
And that should prove causation.
Who's that in with Diane?
Some lady.
She doesn't like men.
No, I mean who are the people?
The people. In there?
Yes.
I don't know.
What do I call you? Is it, uh,
crippled or handicapped or... What's that other word?
What do you call me?
Yeah.
Uh, how about Louis?
No, when I'm talking to other people,
what do I call you?
Challenged.
Hmm? Isn't that the word-- challenged?
Do you like that?
Yes.
...we'll serve Kael Pepper... - Diane.
Do you... do you need me?
No.
Mr. Canning.
Hello, I'm Rayna Hecht.
Well, Ms. Hecht, from Hecht & Tascioni?
You run a tight little shop over there.
Thank you, we try.
So, what do we got going?
Class action. Kael Pepper.
Oh, that was... That was terrible.
Uh, I didn't know we signed it.
Uh, Rayna asked us to be co-counsel.
My Goodness. Good luck.
Terrible thing.
All those children.
Is there something wrong?
Office politics.
Oh, I know that tune.
So, I know it will be difficult talking about the illnesses,
but the stories that you've told us,
you'll have to repeat.
Kalinda.
Something is going on in that little head of his.
Could you find out?
Canning?
Yes. He came in here,
heard about the Kael Pepper class action,
and then rushed off.
I'll find out.
Good things come to those who wait? Well, I guess...
$140,000.
I don't know why we have to pay him a cent-- he's a thief.
Because we have a court date set for tomorrow
if we don't settle this. Mr. Paisley,
the merger's worth $3.7 billion.
$140,000 is nothing.
It's a lot of money.
To me, yeah.
To you, it's what you made while you were sitting here.
I like that sweater.
Thanks.
Send me your cleaning bill.
Agree to pay $140,000 and I'll pay the cleaning bill.
Mr. Paisley, we're ready for you.
You know what I like about you, Alicia?
I have no idea.
You don't take this stuff too seriously.
You and me together on the barricades, huh?
Hold off the hordes.
$140,000?
Pay 'em off.
Don't even want to think about it again.
It's called "Merger insanity."
The new wave of big ticket deals sweeping the biotech industry.
And the newest merger has an old, respected name at the helm.
James Paisley.
Hi there.
We'll be joined by Mr. Paisley shortly...
Geez, Kalinda, don't startle me like that.
Do you have a minute?
For you, all the time in the world.
What's wrong with the Kael Pepper class action?
I don't know. Is there something wrong
with the Kael Pepper class action?
Louis.
Now, this relationship here--the one between us--
is only gonna work if we're gonna be up front with each other.
Diane has asked me to find out
why you have a problem with her class action.
Now, I could investigate...
As you did with my health issues.
Or...
we could be adults.
Just ask questions and talk.
I'm in the process of signing Kael Pepper labs.
Now, we can't represent both the company
and the people who are suing the company.
True.
So I have to figure out a way to...
Just... wait. Just a sec. ...Mr. James Paisley.
I understand there was a bit of drama
at your presentation to the top pension fund managers.
Oh, you mean the pie incident.
Wait, turn it up.
Someone from the protest infiltrated your meeting
and hit you with a pie.
Not even a very tasty pie, I might add.
And was this to protest the fact that this merger
would be sending jobs overseas.
Honestly, Steven, I don't know what it's about.
I don't know what these people want.
I'm standing in my board room,
people downstairs handcuffing themselves to the receptionist's desk,
honking horns, not letting us out of the building.
I felt like, uh...
Anne Frank, hiding from the Nazis.
No, no.
Well, that's a bit extreme, isn't it?
Not really. I feel this country's turned on its head.
曾就「世界新闻报」电话窃听事件发表大胆言论
Tom Perkins may have put it inelegantly,
but he wasn't that far wrong.
Don't say it. Don't say it.
Go for it, go for it, say it.
The one percent is the new hunted minority in this country.
Not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany.
Goal!
Don't call him now, he'll just know you're on the run
and he'll up the price.
We have to risk it.
As soon as he sees this, he's gonna want to go to court.
It doesn't change the facts.
It taints the jury pool.
I wonder how long I should make her wait.
Hi. He saw the interview.
Kalinda?
Yeah, he watched the whole interview. Hang on.
That was really crappy.
I know.
Hey, Alicia,
Uh, we're gonna take our chances in court.
Your case is weak.
Yeah, we both know it's not about the case anymore.
It's about jury selection and,
uh, it's gonna be over before you can say, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury."
We'll go up to $200,000.
Nope, it's now $3 million.
Then we'll see you in court.
That's my line.
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice, Peter.
Jim.
So.
What can I do for you?
It's about the state's attorney race and Finn Polmar.
Well, I figured as much.
Are you referring to the attorney general's report?
Apparently the worst-kept secret in Illinois.
I did approve the charges.
I thought they were justified.
But I certainly never put a gun in Jeffrey Grant's hand.
I think the voters will see that.
Well, great. Great.
Okay, so, it was good talking to you.
It's Finn Polmar
coming out of your wife's apartment building.
That's really pathetic, Jim.
I didn't take the picture, Peter.
It's from a surveillance camera.
Yeah, well, I think you'll see that I was there, also.
Two months ago.
My wife was representing Finn...
against you, I believe.
This is from two weeks ago.
I'm not gonna use it, Peter,
but it will come out.
Finn will be asked about it.
Your wife will be asked about it.
You'll be asked about it.
How do you think it will look
that you endorsed your wife's lover?
I know it's hard...
Seriously?
That's your...?
Well, it was good talking to you.
Have a good day, Jim.
So, how are we with the endorsement?
Want me to polish it?
No.
But you're fine with it?
Who told us about him?
Who told us about Finn?
Yes.
I did.
So you convinced Finn to run?
No. I think Alicia did.
Why?
Let's wait on the endorsement.
W-Why?
I just don't want to make a big thing of it.
Uh, Peter, just so you know,
you have already endorsed him.
You just haven't appeared with him.
Yeah, I know. But let's hold off on it, okay?
We got a problem.
I know.
Kael Pepper and my class action.
We can only represent one of 'em.
Yes. The one that was signed first. Kalinda.
The class action...
Geez, you-you pop out of nowhere.
The class action was signed yesterday at 3:00.
You signed Kael Pepper at 5:00.
No, I signed him at 2:00. I submitted it at 5:00.
Kael Pepper only approached you because of our suit.
They want this to be a conflict of interest.
No, they approached us because we're good lawyers,
and they bring $8 million in yearly business.
Their facility polluted the ground water.
They poisoned those kids.
That's debatable.
No, it isn't.
Diane, if you represent only the innocent,
you'll go quickly out of business.
I got to get to court.
Tell Kael Pepper thank you,
but no thank you.
You know, let's bring it
to the executive committee.
You pitch, I'll pitch, and we'll let the firm decide.
I got to go. Boo.
Are you Jewish?
Am I Jewish? Yeah. Why?
I need you to sit second chair.
On what?
Do you care?
The voir dire process is a very important one,
because it enables the court
and the lawyers to determine whether or not
each of you would be appropriate jurors
for this particular case.
Canning's right.
This trial is over in voir dire.
You had in your employment contract
that we only need a majority to prevail,
so, we just need seven.
Whoever gets the first seven jurors
has the upper hand in negotiations.
This isn't about going to trial.
This is about getting seven jurors.
It could be the difference between
a $200,000 settlement and $8.5 million.
What do I do?
Look wise, and...
every time I touch my nose, you whisper in my ear.
Very well, then. Let's begin.
Ms. Economus, in your capacity as a human resources manager,
do you have access to what other people make?
I mean, salary?
Yes, I do.
And does it rankle you sometimes
how much more executives get paid than other employees?
The CEO of your company, for example.
How much more does that person make
than the average, say, claims adjuster?
I mean, 500 times?
Your Honor, objection.
Your Honor, I believe Mr. Canning is trying
to prejudice our jury against our client
by using out-of-court statements.
Yes, Mr. Canning, I saw the news coverage
of Mr. Paisley's comments, and I am inclined to agree.
Your Honor, I'm merely trying to determine
whether this juror can fairly judge a man
who makes thousands of times what she...
Oh, so you're worried about jurors being fair to our client?
Okay. I'm ruling
that any out-of-court statements having to do with class
or economic differences are irrelevant.
Now step back.
Ms. Economus, how much of a reader are you?
Much of a reader?
Well, I guess as much as anybody else.
Though I read a lot in college.
Have you ever read Diary of Anne Frank?
Your Honor! Objection!
Mr. Canning, I warned you
not to continue with the irrelevant questions.
With irrelevant economic questions, Your Honor.
This was not...
You sure?
Yes, uh, Your Honor, we'd like to amend our suit
to include claim of religious discrimination.
On what grounds?
Mrs. Florrick, that's my job.
My client, Mr. Musset,
has Jewish ancestry on his father's side.
And Mr. Paisley's insensitive remarks last night
about Anne Frank and her
tragic ordeal serves to illustrate the anti-Semitism.
No, I don't believe this. Your Honor?
No, no.
Religious discrimination is a recognized cause of action.
You may think it's a facade,
and I may agree with you,
but that's what a trial is for.
Very well, Mr. Canning.
You can ask your questions after lunch.
Nice work, Howard.
You need to talk to Paisley.
I'm not going to apologize.
They're using it to get the jury they want.
Yes, but I told the truth.
That being surrounded by protestors was like Anne Frank?
I was being hyperbolic.
Then apologize for that.
No. Alicia, you're trying
to get me to apologize for the Nazi reference
so people will think I'm apologizing for the whole thing.
Mr. Paisley, you said that
the one percent were like Jews in Germany.
No. I said Tom Perkins made a good point.
You know who called me this morning?
Neil Gross from Chumhum.
Said, "Thank you.
"It's about time somebody told the truth."
Mr. Paisley, can I have you meet someone?
It'll only take a minute.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Mr. Fishbein, you can come on in.
Where is this putz?
Mr. Paisley, I would like you to meet Mr. Fishbein.
So, you think you have it the same
as the Jews of Nazi Germany?
I'm gonna let you two talk for a minute.
Hey, Finn. What's up?
Hey. I was, uh, just wondering if you knew
why they were delaying the announcement.
No. Are we delaying the announcement?
My office just got a call from Eli.
Did something change?
I don't... I don't know.
Did you call Eli?
Yes. He's not returning my calls.
Okay, let me see what I can find out.
No, I think it's just a temporary delay.
You think?
Yes. We're trying to schedule it for another day.
What's going on, Eli?
Peter won't sign off on the speech.
He asked me who brought Finn to his attention-- you or me.
I did.
I know. Look, let me call you back if I find out more, okay?
Peter?
Oh. Sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, it's fine.
It's fine. Come on in.
Eli, do you know Lauren?
She's one of our interns.
I haven't had the pleasure.
I get your coffee every morning, Mr. Gold.
Lauren has started a blog. "Ex...
Journalism Major"?
"Journalism Major in Exile."
Ah. Anyway, she was hoping
to get an interview with me.
Just a human interest piece. You know,
like, what makes you tick, all that.
Yeah. I like it.
So, let's put it on the schedule.
Mm. Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
Governor Florrick.
Governor Florrick.
Thank you.
Oh, by the way,
don't worry.
It's not too red.
What's not too red?
Her lipstick.
You can go, you stay.
What's your name?
Lauren.
Take a step back.
What?
Take one step back.
You are now 50 feet from the governor's office.
Don't ever cross this line again.
You are not to talk to the governor.
You're not to look at the governor.
If the governor talks to you,
you will smile, nod, and say you're needed in polling
on the third floor.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You asked him if your lipstick was red enough.
Just for future reference, that's wrong.
He complimented me on it.
Lauren,
do you want your job?
50 feet.
This line. Get it?
Yes.
Good.
I just want to express my sincere regret
for my unfortunate choice of words yesterday.
Good job. How'd you do it?
Mr. Fishbein, the Holocaust survivor.
...obviously comparing myself,
or anyone to Anne Frank was extreme and ill-considered,
and I want to apologize to anyone
who may have been offended by my insensitivity...
Yup, Alicia got to him.
What?
I understand you've come on tonight
after meeting with a Holocaust survivor.
Yes, and I will say that it was an enlightening experience.
But he understood that these were the words
of a self-educated man who was struggling for a metaphor.
That's all.
Good, good.
He also understood my frustration with the protestors.
No.
You mean, the backlash against the one percent.
Is that what I am?
I always thought I was a guy just trying to make a living.
Stop talking!
And your "Frustration," As you put it, is with those who don't?
Look, a man has to pull his weight.
This is America,
and there's a reason for this being the greatest country in the world.
We reward winners.
This is not Italy or Greece.
We do not reward the lazy.
Oh, dear God. Someone just throw a blanket over him.
Do we have any Greeks or Italians on the jury?
So, what do you think of Tom Perkins'
suggestion that voting rights should be tied to tax brackets?
Well, I probably shouldn't say this...
Oh, say it, say it.
...but I think there's some merit to it.
Well, we just lost juror number four...
and juror number two...
and possibly two others. Want me to talk to Paisley this time?
No, I will.
Don't babysit me, Eli.
Don't... - I am an adult.
If I want Lauren to avoid my office,
I will tell her myself.
Are we talking about that intern?
Yes, we're talking about that intern.
I will handle my own life.
I don't need you to be making decisions for me.
Peter,
you are a politician with a reputation.
You can either put that
behind you or... - I will not be...
I will not be contained in a bubble.
I have to be with people; that's who I am.
Okay, if this were a normal conversation,
I would now make fun of you for saying that
"Lauren the intern" is people.
'Cause I can find you
people in the supermarket or the Shop 'n Save.
But this doesn't seem to be a normal conversation,
so what the hell's going on?
Nothing's going on.
I'm just tired of being cooped up.
So plan your vacation with Alicia.
No.
Oh, come on, Peter, you deserve it.
Let me call her.
No. No.
Please.
Why not?
Well, Alicia and I...
Peter... Peter...
It's okay.
Alicia.
Do you have time to talk for a minute?
No, I-I'm coming over.
Mom, do we really have to do this right now?
Come on, it'll only take five minutes.
Come on, your grandma wants a picture of you.
I'll get it.
Oh, it's probably Eli.
Great. More people to come make fun of me.
Hey. Mom's in here.
You look great.
All right, that's enough.
No, no, no. I need a picture. Over here.
Come over here.
What's up, Eli?
Nothing much.
Just need a few minutes.
Zach. Grace.
Hi.
You sound so formal.
No. I'm just... - Be happy.
Be happy.
watching a family...
...be a family.
Okay, Okay.
Wait up, wait up.
Want some?
Uh, n-no.
So, what do we need to discuss away from the kids?
Peter and you.
Okay.
Shoot.
What's going on with Peter and you?
Why?
Because I get the sense that there's something going on.
Did Peter say something?
No. Peter specifically did not say something.
Then why are you asking?
Because I care.
What? I do care.
Even if only on the most cynical level,
but I want Peter to stay in office.
Then ask Peter.
Is this about Will dying?
This is about everything.
I'm just tired, Eli.
I'm just done.
You're getting a divorce?
No.
Then what?
We're staying together, but that's it.
Whatever Peter does...
I don't want the kids to find out.
Oh, my... God.
I can't believe... this is crazy.
I have to go hem a robe.
It was good seeing you, Eli.
Alicia, you're hurting-- that's all.
I've been watching you over the last year with Peter.
You love him.
And if you don't, he loves you.
Not buying what you're selling, Nate.
Well, fine. Just make it fast.
You need me?
What's he offering you?
Who?
Canning. To vote his way against my class action.
Nothing. We share a philosophy, that's all.
Money trumps everything?
Well, it is why we're in business, isn't it?
Fine. Two words: Rayna Hecht.
The rainmaker?
She brought me this class action.
It's important to her.
Important enough to bring her here?
She told me she's finding life with Tascioni a bit, uh...
too constricting.
And you can deliver?
I'm giving my final presentation
to the executive committee in two days.
Rayna will present as well.
Well, if it's true, I'm all yours.
Your Honor,
we have no objections to seating Mr. Rizzardi--
he seems like he'd make a great juror.
Your Honor, we'd like to exercise
one of our peremptory challenges.
For what? Why? What's wrong with him?
Nothing's wrong with him.
That's why we're exercising our peremptory challenge.
It's because he's Italian, isn't it?
It is our right...
That's enough!
Mr. Rizzardi, you're excused.
He's still up by two jurors.
Unless we can disqualify one.
Your Honor,
may we approach again?
Faster the better. Come on.
Your Honor, my apologies, but I believe that
one of Mr. Canning's... I mean,
one of the jurors that's already been seated may have been biased
by my client's most recent comments.
Your Honor, this is outrageous.
We've already agreed on each one of these jurors.
Outrageous, we say.
Yes, Your Honor,
but if a statement has been made
in the press that would render
one of them incapable of being fair and unbiased,
well, it's like Mr. Canning said:
we all want a fair jury.
So, Ms. Economus, you heard my client
Mr. Paisley's latest comments?
No.
I mean, I didn't hear them directly--
a girlfriend of mine
mentioned something about it.
I see. So,
as a Greek person, how did you feel
about his comments about Greece as a country?
This is ridiculous.
I'm from Skokie.
Yes, but your heritage is Greek, isn't it?
Well, sure. Both sides.
So, uh, you must have been offended
when Mr. Paisley said that if America starts rewarding losers
instead of winners,
we'll end up like Greece.
Uh, y-you know, now that you mention it, yeah,
it was very offensive.
You have an agreement?
You and Alicia?
You talked with my wife?
I did. That's why the intern?
Eli, I don't pry into your life.
I don't have a life; your life is my life.
Then let me live.
So no divorce?
And you and Alicia can do whatever you want
as long as no one knows?
Is that what she told you?
Just so you know, Peter, I have worked before
with politicians who have made arrangements
to keep their extramarital activities from becoming public.
It doesn't work; it will always come out.
Doesn't matter who-- an intern,
a donor, your biggest fan...
they all want to talk.
They'll promise not to,
but they will... talk.
Yeah.
And sometimes things come out when they don't talk.
Where'd this come from?
What was that, Peter?
Let's not discuss it.
We've got work to do.
Ah, Alicia.
Do you have some Greeks and Italians for me to meet?
You're going to issue a statement
saying that you're giving a million dollars to charity,
and that you do not believe voting should be
tied with a person's tax bracket.
What if I don't believe that?
You think I should have less of a vote than you?
Well, I don't know; how much do you make?
Mr. Paisley, I know you.
I know you like to think of yourself as blunt and direct.
But this isn't just blunt.
No, you don't know me.
You think this is hubris.
I built a business from nothing.
In '99, I lost it in the tech bust.
And I built it up again.
From nothing.
You're not poor now, Mr. Paisley.
Neither are you.
I've seen your bills.
You may choose to disguise it
in all these earthy surroundings, but...
you are the one percent.
Did you know my company is developing
a gene that will prolong a person's life?
We are....
the one percent.
Then what are you worried about?
You're winning.
You have a lot of things, Mr. Paisley--
why do you feel so cornered?
Because there are more people who want than people who have.
Read Ayn Rand.
Oh, dear God.
Have you read her books? They're awful.
Well, they weren't meant to be Moby-Dick,
they were meant to make you think.
A guy bombs a building, the rich go out on strike--
I-it's a 12-year-old's view of the world.
It's like basing your philosophy on the books of John Grisham.
You should reread them.
Mr. Paisley,
you've always told me that you are a bottom-line kind of guy.
I am.
So here's the bottom line. We're losing jury members.
And the fund managers are getting nervous.
If it continues,
they may not support this merger.
And what's worse, you're in a media death spiral.
No matter what you say, you will never get a fair interpretation.
You have to put out a statement.
Another apology.
No. A statement.
We'll hire a PR firm,
using a focus group to find the right words.
As long as I don't have to answer questions again.
You won't.
And as long as you do it for me.
I'll be right back.
We're seeing a lot of each other, Eli.
Are you sleeping with Finn Polmar?
Ask me another question.
I don't have any other questions.
Then go to hell.
There is a photo of Finn leaving your apartment.
Where?
Outside your apartment.
No. Where's the photo?
Peter had it.
Now, I have some worries here.
Peter, you, Finn.
The politics of all three.
Castro.
Yeah.
This is the reply we were waiting for.
The state's attorney did not send it to Finn.
He sent it to Peter.
I did not sleep with Finn.
He came to my apartment the morning of his appearance
before the Integrity Panel
so we could get our strategy lined up, that's all.
I am sorry for asking.
That's okay.
We seem to share everything these days.
Don't.
I have to.
Odd choice.
Hello? Yes.
Yes, that's great.
10:00 a.m. is fine.
Okay. Thank you.
Tell Ms. Hecht we're looking forward to it.
Sorry.
I can turn it off now.
You're meeting with Rayna Hecht?
Kalinda, we're not doing this anymore.
Hello. You've reached the voice mail for Rayna Hecht.
Please leave a message.
Rayna. Uh, Diane Lockhart.
I was expecting you here at, uh, noon, and it's now 1:30.
I hope nothing's wrong.
Please call me.
What time was her meeting with Florrick-Agos?
10:00 a.m.
Thank you, Kalinda.
She's not coming, is she?
I don't know.
Is she still in play?
Diane?
I understand.
Let's get this over with.
It's not what you think.
You talked to Alicia?
I did, and it is not what you think.
And what do I think?
That Alicia's sleeping with Finn. She's not.
She represented him during Castro's witch hunt,
and on the day of his hearing,
she was running late, because she was...
Mourning... Will.
exhausted.
So Finn went over there to meet with her. That's all.
Okay.
Thanks.
Peter...
No, no, no. Really, thanks. I get it.
Okay, and how many of you like option number two?
And we have a winner.
Have you ever focus-grouped an apology before?
No. A marriage proposal once.
Oh, you're kidding me.
He was a comic book writer.
He was terrible with women. It was David Lee's idea.
They liked number two.
Oh, great, the one he didn't like.
He doesn't get to vote.
And, uh, two people
suggested "Backed into a corner" instead of pushed.
No. "Pushed" is better.
"Backed" is to passive.
Okay, what's the final version?
"Anyone who knows me knows I've have a tendency
"to bristle when pushed into a corner.
I end up saying things that I not only regret..."
But truly do not believe.
My comments were thoughtless,
and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
More to the point-- and I want to be clear--
it's no one's fault if they are poor.
And you feel that was a sincere apology, Mrs. Florrick?
Yes, I do. I believe that Mr. Paisley's feelings were summed up
by the words he spoke today.
Words that he has lived by his entire life.
Not by the few sentences he spoke two days ago.
Well, you're a paid flack. Don't you have to say that?
I'm his lawyer, Steve.
Donald. I'm the other one.
My apologies, Donald.
In my own experience, Mr. Paisley is a sincere man
who spoke today from his heart.
But let's be honest.
The poor aren't the only ones he's disparaged.
Isn't he being sued for firing someone who's gay?
That is not true, Don.
Actually, this is Don. Don Keats.
Steven is the black guy to my right.
Um... my apologies.
I don't have a monitor here.
Why don't I just stop using names?
Sure. That's easiest for you.
There wasn't a monitor in the room!
I couldn't see them!
You don't have to convince me.
Yeah, but they're making me out to look like a racist.
Hello.
Oh, boy.
Mr. Paisley?
I think you should be working up an apology, Alicia.
Thank you, Ms. Bouchard.
Your Honor, we're fine with this juror.
Ms. Bouchard, you are empanelled.
And that, amazingly,
completes our selection process.
We'll take a short recess.
Thank you.
Okay, she puts us over the top seven to five.
Uh, I don't think so.
Well, I'm afraid by my count, that makes us deadlocked.
Six-six.
What do you propose, Mr. Canning?
$5 million.
I think Mr. Paisley will find it cheap in the long run.
Hey, have you seen the news?
Oh, God, what now?
No, no, no, it's good.
The state attorney general's office today
expanded its pharmaceutical investigation
to include Kael Pepper Laboratories,
a multinational company that's been accused
of price gouging patients in the distribution
of their AIDS medication Reyacept.
What-what am I supposed to see?
Just watch.
No comment, no comment.
Thank you.
Oh, that's good.
Very clever, but it's not gonna work.
What won't?
Juror number seven.
You think because he's gay
he'll hate that I represent a firm that was accused
of price gouging AIDS medication,
but you forget he occupied Wall Street for six straight weeks.
He slept in a cardboard box on the sidewalk,
and that's what he cares about.
He's gay.
Hmm, I didn't know that.
That's not the juror you should worry about, Mr. Canning.
It's juror number five,
Joanne Honig.
You don't remember?
Her son died last year.
Aids.
It's a tragedy.
$2 million.
$500,000.
$1 million and it's a drop in the bucket.
And besides, none of us knows for sure
what any of these jurors are gonna do anyway, do we?
It's a deal, Mr. Canning, but stick to it this time.
Diane,
I'm sorry.
I don't think it's gonna work out.
I don't understand.
I have concerns.
What concerns?
Just things I'm hearing.
Such as?
Such as...
that you're having trouble putting Will's death behind you.
That you're stepping away from the day-to-day management of the firm.
You're losing clients.
None of that is true.
Lyle Pollard?
I withdrew from that case to avoid suborning perjury.
You would've done the same,
and where are you hearing all of this?
I'd rather not say.
Was it Florrick-Agos?
Is that where you're going?
I don't know where I'm going yet.
I'm sorry.
I wish it could've worked out, Diane.
I'd like you to keep the class action.
You don't understand.
I've lost the class action.
Without you, I didn't have the votes.
What votes?
It doesn't matter now.
If you would like, I will, uh,
help you find new counsel.
Diane...
I am sorry.
Why'd you do it?
Diane.
Why did I... what are we talking about?
You want to make a play for Rayna Hecht,
by all means, have a meeting and make your pitch,
but to denigrate me,
to spread lies about my dedication to my firm!
Diane!
We had a meeting scheduled with Rayna.
I mean, she was here, but the meeting never happened.
She left.
She left?
Yes.
She got a call from Canning, and then she left.
I just assumed that she made up her mind to go with you.
Canning poisoned the well
at his own firm.
So you're being marginalized
by the partnership at Lockhart/Gardner?
Well, I know what that's like.
Diane,
if there's anything we can do...
Alicia, this is not our fight.
Cary...
No.
He's right.
You're right.
It's my fight.
Not now, Eli.
Do you need anything else, sir?
