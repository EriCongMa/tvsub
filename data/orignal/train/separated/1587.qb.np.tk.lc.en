we can &apos;t do this .
but i &apos;m not getting adopted .
i have to think about this . i have to ...
is it because of lou ? is lou why you can &apos;t be with me ?
no , you &apos;re the reason why i can &apos;t be with you , callie .
i &apos;m done . we &apos;re done .
let &apos;s start our own dance team .
hey , kaitlyn . i quit .
i really like you . what do i have to do to prove it to you ?
what is with that towel ?
oh , my god !
ana and i , we &apos;re working the program together .
i pray i can do better for this baby
than i did for my twins .
this is my worst nightmare .
dirt in your food . bugs in your tent .
you &apos;re sweating the whole time .
and then it gets dark , and you &apos;re like ,
&quot; oh , where are the lights ? &quot;
but guess what , there are no lights . why ?
because you &apos;re camping .
i &apos;ve never been .
i had fun on my seventh @-@ grade trip . mostly .
and , to make matters worse ,
i should be here this weekend ... auditioning dancers .
why are we whispering ?
hayley &apos;s here .
saying &quot; goodbye &quot; to jesus .
wait . what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m mad at you .
it &apos;s just one weekend .
the one weekend my mom &apos;s out of town .
i had big plans . naked plans .
what am i supposed to do ?
you could say you &apos;re sick .
my moms would never let me stay home alone .
i &apos;m staying home alone .
seriously , your moms are so ...
hey , mrs. adams foster !
hey , hayley .
want to explain to me why your door is closed ?
i don &apos;t know . it must have been blown shut .
mm . must have been all the hot air in here .
i should ... i should go .
so soon ?
i &apos;ll lead you out .
ok .
ok , troops , we &apos;re leaving in ten minutes !
let &apos;s go ! chop @-@ chop @-@ chop !
hey . so , i was thinking ,
what if we make the kids leave their phones at home ?
do you want a mutiny ?
no , i want them to actually experience
something without tweeting or twerking about it .
twerking ? do you know what twerking is ?
yeah , some kind of social media thing .
this is twerking .
really ? i like that . do that more often .
honey , i know you want
this weekend to be a big bonding experience ,
but the kids are addicted to their phones .
fine . great .
then we &apos;ll take the tv with us and video games . it &apos;ll be awesome .
or we can just let them wean themselves off .
and once we get out into nature ,
with hopefully very bad reception ,
i bet you they &apos;ll put them down .
oh , yeah ?
well , i will take that bet . and when they don &apos;t ,
i don &apos;t want it to fall on me to crack the whip .
you can &apos;t be &quot; nice mom &quot; all the time .
i &apos;m not &quot; nice mom . &quot;
yes , you are .
why do you think they always confide in you ?
they don &apos;t . they ... they come to you .
yeah , when they want a push .
when they want a hug , they choose you .
i &apos;m not mad about it , that &apos;s just the way it is .
sorry .
no problem .
uh , we ... we were just saying goodbye .
yeah .
two whole days . how will i ever survive ?
uh , well , stef asked me to put this stuff in lena &apos;s car .
oh , we &apos;re taking two cars now ?
yeah . mariana has a lot of stuff , so ...
right . shocker .
uh , do you need help ?
i &apos;ll just ... no , i &apos;m good .
ok . all right .
what ?
you &apos;re bright red .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m just not a pda guy .
hm ... you &apos;re hilarious .
i &apos;m ...
what ?
why don &apos;t we talk ?
about what ?
i don &apos;t know .
how &apos;s ... how &apos;s wrestling going ?
it &apos;s fine .
and ... and hayley ? how are things with her ?
she &apos;s whatever .
you never said what you thought of alateen .
did you find it helpful or ... ?
ana &apos;s pregnant .
so you &apos;re approximately 17 weeks along ?
um , i think so . uh , yeah .
your amniotic fluid looks good .
the baby &apos;s ... 11 centimeters .
that &apos;s about four and a half inches .
so small .
everything looks perfect .
i &apos;m just gonna take some pictures .
would you like to know the sex ?
sure .
you &apos;re having a girl .
a girl .
congratulations .
wow . she has your eyes .
actually , those are her feet .
have you told anyone else ?
no . just you .
you should not have gone to that aa meeting without permission .
i know .
there are gonna have to be ... some consequences .
do you have to tell mom ?
yes . of course i &apos;m gonna tell mom .
and actually , i think it might be nice if you told her yourself .
i can &apos;t tell her .
you told me .
yeah , because you don &apos;t get so mad .
that is not true . i just don &apos;t ...
... show my madness as madly .
but i get mad . i am ... i am mad !
can &apos;t you ... ? come ...
no !
and when you do tell her ,
just don &apos;t mention that you ... that you told me .
why ?
because ...
it &apos;ll make her feel good .
that ana &apos;s pregnant ?
no . that you came to her first .
oh , and she won &apos;t get so mad . i get it .
that &apos;s a good strategy .
what are you doing in there ?
oh . you &apos;re not gonna need that .
why not ?
we &apos;re glamping .
um , won &apos;t we be cold , though ?
i brought double @-@ down comforters and a curling iron
and blow dryer that plug into the car . so we &apos;re set .
for what ?
i ... don &apos;t understand the question .
don &apos;t you think we &apos;re a little far from the kids ?
not too far we can &apos;t keep an eye on them .
but just far enough that they don &apos;t have to hear us .
oh . hear us ? doing what ?
i don &apos;t know , twerking ?
is that what you did ? having a fit . i don &apos;t ...
hey , we &apos;re out in the wilderness , right ? aren &apos;t we ?
we get a little wild ourselves ? little ...
dog ...
what are you guys doing ?
oh , nothing . nothing . what &apos;s up ?
uh , can we go in the water ?
you gotten the firewood ?
yep .
you have ?
yep .
all right , fine .
just be careful where you walk with bare feet .
and remember , &quot; leaves of three , leave them be ! &quot;
go ! get out of here !
maybe we &apos;re not far enough .
exactly .
dude , get out !
oh ! i &apos;m sorry ! i didn &apos;t know you were ...
what &apos;s that on your ... ?
it that real ?
no , it &apos;s just a marker .
ok , yeah , it is real .
but moms don &apos;t know , and if you tell anyone , i will kill you .
ok .
i mean it , don &apos;t go tattling .
i won &apos;t . but , um ... how &apos;re you gonna go swimming ?
you &apos;re gonna hang ten on the pond ?
mom , some of us don &apos;t want to get skin cancer , right ?
yeah , but there is something called sunscreen , you know .
did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens
that show up in people &apos;s livers ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
the best way to protect yourself
from the sun &apos;s damaging rays is to cover up .
ok , i stand corrected .
you &apos;re welcome .
mom . can i talk to you about something ?
uh , well ...
hey , uh , maybe just stay in the shallow end , ok ?
why ? i know how to swim .
not in a lake .
there could be a sudden drop @-@ off .
and it &apos;s dark and you can &apos;t see the bottom . it &apos;s not like a pool .
i can &apos;t keep an eye on you every second , all right ?
so just don &apos;t take any chances .
you comin &apos; in , or what ?
uh , nah , i ...
it &apos;s actually pretty cold .
oh , come on !
hey , i don &apos;t blame you .
i was watching this special on the nature channel .
two words : lake monsters .
ana &apos;s pregnant ?
according to jesus ,
that &apos;s the announcement she made at the aa meeting .
which he did not have permission to go to .
i hope you told him there &apos;ll be consequences .
which i will be doling out .
what are we gonna tell mariana ?
i don &apos;t think we tell her anything .
not until we know for sure .
not gonna take it well .
who do you think the father is ?
who knows ?
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s ... i mean ...
... it &apos;s not mike ?
right , he couldn &apos;t possibly be that stupid .
hey , so , um ...
sorry about ... walking in on , or out , on , uh ,
on you and lou earlier .
oh , it &apos;s fine , don &apos;t worry about it . no big deal .
it wasn &apos;t weird for you ?
no .
was it weird for you ?
no . not at all .
i just don &apos;t want it to be weird for you .
well , it &apos;s not .
cool .
so , um ...
it &apos;s gettin &apos; chilly . i think i &apos;m gonna go in .
yeah , me too .

well , i , uh , i think you taught
us all a little something about patience today .
and we &apos;re all gonna try a bite of this , right , kids ?
thank god we brought burgers .
i thought you didn &apos;t eat meat .
hey , we are out here in the
middle of nowhere , fighting for our lives .
i &apos;m in survival mode .
did you put bug spray on , jude ?
no .
come on , you know mosquitoes love you .
&apos;cause you &apos;re so sweet .
watch us get malaria .
come here , i &apos;ll spray you down .
arms out . shut your eyes .
what if hayley comes looking for me ? moms &apos;ll freak .
relax . she &apos;s not gonna do that .
you don &apos;t know hayley .
i &apos;m surprised she already hasn &apos;t turned up .
i gotta get to her before she does . cover for me .
what ?
i &apos;ve gotta go to the bathroom . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , you know the drill .
it &apos;s almost dark out . two at a time , please .
i know where the bathroom is , mom .
i don &apos;t know why we need that rule out here .
because we &apos;re in the woods , jesus . and we have to be careful .
of what ?
well , of bears , for one thing .
which reminds me , we gotta be careful about scraps out here . ok ?
we can &apos;t leave anything out that might draw them over .
um , i &apos;m sorry . did you just say bears ?
well , yeah , honey . this is bear country .
i think the campground website
said something about a sighting just last week .
so keep that in mind .
* she &apos;ll be comin &apos; round the mountain when she comes . *
* yes , she will ! *
* she &apos;ll be comin &apos; round the mountain when she comes . *
* yes , she will ! *
* she &apos;ll be comin &apos; round the mountain , *
* she &apos;ll be * comin &apos; round the mountain *
* she &apos;ll be comin &apos; round the mountain when she comes . *
* yes , she will ! *
she better not .
now , the key ...
... to architecting the perfect s &apos;more is squishability .
if you can &apos;t squish it , don &apos;t dish it . got it ?
got it .
* hi , babe ! *
* we &apos;ll all be shouting hallelujah when she comes . *
* hallelujah ! *
* we &apos;ll all be shoutin &apos; hallelujah when she comes . *
just don &apos;t get too close to the fire . i mean , do you want me ...
i said i got it .
ok .
* we &apos;ll all be shoutin &apos; hallelujah when she comes . *
* hallelujah ! *
good !
ok , brandon , your turn .
your turn !
uh , ok . any requests ?
play that song you wrote for lou .
what song ?
you know , the one you guys played at the party .
what party would this be ?
uh ... oh , just a friend &apos;s .
i think she means &quot; outlaws . &quot; you should play it .
i didn &apos;t write that for lou .
it &apos;s what it looked like on stage . you guys were totally vibing .
ok , is that like twerking ? is that the same as twerking ?
what ?
so is something going on between you and lou ?
yeah , they &apos;re totally dating , duh .
well , isn &apos;t that interesting ?
i wonder why you didn &apos;t mention that during your pitch
for going away on tour this summer .
yes , i wonder .
that certainly adds another matter to consider .
you know , there &apos;s nothing
we can do on tour that we can &apos;t do at home .
but can we just talk about this later , maybe ?
i think maybe we should talk about
putting cameras in the garage . what do you think ?
i think you should stop talking and start playing .
more s &apos;mores ?
i &apos;ll have one . hand me a skewer .
we should turn in .
we &apos;re gonna be up with the sun . right ?
it &apos;s early . it &apos;s really early .
right ?
hey , i &apos;m trying to get them to let me go on tour . ok ?
so i can &apos;t be caught doing something stupid .
what if i get lost or get eaten by a bear or something ?
i &apos;m more worried about you getting eaten by hayley .
you gotta cut that girl loose , man .
she &apos;s out there all alone , waiting for me .
why don &apos;t you just tell moms ?
they already don &apos;t like her .
ok , well , i &apos;m not sneaking out
with you so you can tell hayley you can &apos;t sneak out .
sorry , man , you &apos;re on your own .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
do you need me to go with you ?
no .
we &apos;re supposed to go in twos .
don &apos;t be such a boy scout .
good night . don &apos;t let the mosquitoes bite .
you know what ? i think i &apos;m gonna go
and check for trash one last time .
we already did that .
i know , i know . it &apos;s just to be safe .
just to be safe . ok ? i &apos;ll be back in two seconds .
sorry , i was trying not to wake you .
it &apos;s fine . ah . what time is it ?
oh , it &apos;s late .
i should get going .
why don &apos;t you spend the night ?
in fact , i &apos;ve been thinking ...
why don &apos;t you just move in ?
brandon , wake up .
hey , brandon .
what ?
jesus isn &apos;t back .
how long has he been gone ?
over an hour .
is that a watch ?
yeah . people still wear them , you know .
idiot .
not you .
what if he &apos;s lost ?
he &apos;s not lost .
what if he is ?
all right , i &apos;ll go look for him .
where did he go ? and don &apos;t say the bathroom .
hayley surprised him . she &apos;s at another campsite .
but you can &apos;t tell . ok ?
ok .
should i come with you ?
no , no . stay here . i &apos;ll be back .
moms ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s wrong , baby ?
well , he &apos;s not in the men &apos;s room .
women &apos;s either .
they knew to go to the bathroom in pairs .
i &apos;m starting to get worried .
jude said they &apos;ve been gone for hours .
they &apos;re just lost .
someone &apos;s coming . who &apos;s there ?
mrs. adams fosters ? what are you doing here ?
hayley ?
what are you doing here ?
why didn &apos;t you just come back ?
she wasn &apos;t at her campsite . i had to go look for her .
she &apos;s probably lost .
well , now so are we .
i think i remember seeing that star . maybe we &apos;re that way .
oh , thanks a lot , magellan .
who &apos;s magellan ?
seriously ? he navigated by the ...
this explains a lot .
what was that ?
how should i know ?
don &apos;t shine your light on it .
why not ?
what if it &apos;s a bear ?
oh , it &apos;s much worse than a bear .
hayley ? what are you doing here ?
is it morning already ?
i &apos;m sorry , honey .
i know this trip isn &apos;t turning out the way you planned .
really ? whatever gave you that idea ?
i didn &apos;t know she was coming .
i was gonna text her and tell her not to come ,
but then somebody took away my phone .
so this is our fault ?
well ...
i told him to tell you guys .
thank you .
for what it &apos;s worth .
for what it &apos;s worth , why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not a narc .
like some people .
hey . jude did the right thing .
you guys could have been in danger out there .
and brandon , the lack of judgment on your part
is not making a very strong case for going on tour .
so what are you guys gonna do about hayley ?
until we get in touch with her mom ,
not gonna let her go home alone .
so for now , we &apos;re stuck with her .
good morning .
sorry i ruined your family trip .
hard to ruin something that already kinda sucked .
my mom went away with her new boyfriend this weekend ,
and i just didn &apos;t wanna be home alone .
your parents really got divorced ?
yeah .
i miss you on the team .
really ?
and kaitlyn is like a bitch times a billion since you left .
she &apos;s so freaked out by your new team .
yeah , our team of two .
you guys already have the best dancers at school .
well , there &apos;s two we don &apos;t have .
what you guys did was pretty awesome .
putting kaitlyn in her place .
nobody else had the guts to do it .
i should &apos;ve walked , too .
well , why don &apos;t you ?
i , uh , heard about your little adventure last night .
so , um , is lou hiding around here somewhere too ?
like , uh , in a tree or something ?
very funny .
how &apos;s the fire goin &apos; ?
you mean my punishment ?
moms put me in charge of breakfast .
but i can &apos;t get any of this stupid kindling to catch .
here , won &apos;t this help ?
wait , no , don &apos;t ... jeez , callie !
what ? !
of course you &apos;d throw gasoline on a fire .
i &apos;m sorry ?
jude .
jude , what are you doing ?
going swimming .
ok , well , don &apos;t go out too far .
jude ?
jude , look . i don &apos;t have a suit on .
just wait a second and i &apos;ll go with you .
jude , what are you doing ?
i can swim , callie !
i don &apos;t need you to watch me !
and i &apos;m not afraid of the water because it &apos;s dark .
i &apos;m not a baby !
i know that .
then stop treating me like one ! i &apos;m 13 !
and everyone keeps treating me like a kid , because you do .
you know what ? just get out of my way and leave me alone !
for your information , i didn &apos;t tell them about hayley .
i told them that you were lost , which you were !
but next time , you can just get eaten by bears , for all i care .
never seen jude go off like that before .
well , you know , we can be explosive like that .
i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
no , it &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve caused a lot of drama , i guess , for you .
i &apos;ve caused my share , you know , too .
i don &apos;t want it to be weird .
it &apos;s not weird .
it was weird .
on the porch , yesterday .
it would &apos;ve been weird if it was mariana .
really ? that weird ?
what do you want me to say ? i ...
just be honest , brandon .
ok .
it was hard for me when you were with wyatt .
being together .
you know , being affectionate .
or not , when ... i was around .
and i just don &apos;t want to rub it your face .
did i rub wyatt in your face ?
no , but i ...
i was in the position you &apos;re in right now .
and it didn &apos;t feel great .
well ...
what ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i should
thank you for not wanting to hurt me , but ...
... you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m feeling .
i &apos;m not , like , pining after you . you have a girlfriend .
and i &apos;m happy for you .
so you just do your thing , i &apos;ll do mine .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t want to feel like i &apos;m holding you back .
ok .
and you can talk to me about lou .
what ? you mean , like right now ?
well , it &apos;s not like there &apos;s much else to do out here ,
you know , without our phones .
talk .
ok , uh ...
what do you want to know ?
how &apos;s it going between you two ?
it &apos;s fine . good , i guess .
what do you like about her ?
uh ... i don &apos;t know .
really , you have no idea what you like about her ?
she &apos;s smart , and talented .
and pretty .
yes . pretty .
sexy ?
yes .
good kisser ? it looked like it yest ...
ok , you &apos;re making it weird .
this is weird .
was wyatt a good kisser ?
ok , ok . yes .
i should probably talk to jude .
yeah , me too .
or we ... we could just take him swimming .
robots are people too .
free all robots .
see , it &apos;s cool , right ?
we were thinking of , like , a dystopian future @-@ type theme .
and i read somewhere that robots are , like , the new vampires .
so it &apos;s super current .
i read that too .
tia is going to flip when she hears you switched teams .
it sucked having to pretend to be enemies .
i mean , you &apos;re not only my friend , but my boyfriend &apos;s sister .
and with everything you &apos;ve been going through .
what all have i been going through ?
jesus told me about your birth mom being pregnant .
and that brandon &apos;s dad might be the father .
and i just want you to know that i &apos;m here for you .
you didn &apos;t tell me ana &apos;s pregnant !
mom told me not to !
what &apos;s going on ?
is mike the father of ana &apos;s baby ?
who told you that ?
hayley . i had to hear it from his girlfriend !
you told me you didn &apos;t tell anyone else .
so everyone knows ?
wait a minute . when did jesus tell you this ?
i ...
when did you tell mama ?
she told me not to tell you i told her first .
well , as long as jesus is sharing everybody &apos;s secrets ,
did he tell you the one about his tattoo ?
what ? !
oh , my god . that is huge ! when did you get that ?
at the mexican street festival .
you got this at a street festival ?
do you have any idea how lucky you are ?
it could have gotten infected !
you could &apos;ve gotten hepatitis ...
they didn &apos;t card you ?
the guy just took my money . that &apos;s it .
ok , who ? because this is a crime , jesus . it &apos;s a crime . who ?
mom , it &apos;s not like i got his card or anything .
you don &apos;t even know his name ? !
honey .
that &apos;s great . please don &apos;t &quot; honey &quot; me .
and please stop making me feel like
i have to be the disciplinarian &quot; dad &quot; in this family .
that is awfully heteronormative thinking .
this is the time and place to have that conversation .
so are we done , or ... ?
no ! we are not !
why would you do this ? !
&apos;cause i wanted to show hayley how much i liked her .
honey , that is what jewelry is for !
where is hayley , anyway ? hayley !
mom , she &apos;s probably hiding . i should go look for her .
if i &apos;m allowed .
yes . you may go .
but we are far from done talking about this .
that &apos;s rich .
i discipline them just as much as you do .
oh , yeah ? how about asking one of them to lie ?
listen , i am sorry . i should not have done that .
ok .
i just didn &apos;t want you to feel bad
that he came to me first .
you didn &apos;t want me to be right .
you know why they come to you , lena ?
because i &apos;m the nice mom .
no , because you &apos;re easy mom .
just because i don &apos;t fly off the handle ?
you don &apos;t wanna be the bad guy .
i don &apos;t fly off the handle !
why does anybody have to be the bad guy .
someone has to lay down the law ! that &apos;s why .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t come to you .
because you don &apos;t parent them ,
you police them !
oh , that &apos;s not fair !
i &apos;m not saying all the time .
i am just saying that sometimes ,
sometimes your anger can be intimid ...
ok , maybe not ...
your intensity can be a little intimidating .
so they &apos;re scared of me ?
they love you .
but i intimidate them ?
you are a powerful , passionate woman .
you intimidate me sometimes .
oh , please , come on .
it &apos;s true . and it &apos;s one of the things that i love about you .
how strong you are .
and maybe i am softer than i should be , at times .
i don &apos;t like conflict . you know that about me .
but if we want the kids to talk to us ,
they have to feel heard .
you make them feel safe in so many ways ,
so many ways i never could ,
but they have to feel safe to talk to you too .
well , somebody has to talk to mariana .
and i &apos;m sure that she wants you .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t play the martyr .
they want both of us .
your parents must hate me .
they &apos;re not your biggest fans right now .
thanks to mariana .
i never should &apos;ve come .
i should &apos;ve never gotten your name tattooed on me .
i didn &apos;t even want to .
well , i didn &apos;t make you .
i know . that &apos;s the problem .
i do things that i don &apos;t wanna do when i &apos;m with you .
what are ... what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i ... i think we should break up .
fine .
if that &apos;s what you want .
and you can tell your sister
and her stupid dance team to go to hell .
i bet you really love camping now . huh ?
can we go home ?
what , and leave paradise ? come on .
don &apos;t cry . honey , don &apos;t cry .
i know it sucks being blindsided .
it &apos;s just always something with ana .
and i feel like if i never started talking to her ,
then none of this would &apos;ve happened .
no , that &apos;s not true .
now we can &apos;t get rid of her .
and , what , is , like , mike gonna marry her ?
i highly doubt that .
he &apos;s just trying to help her get sober .
yeah , but what if she starts doing drugs again ?
she can &apos;t take care of a baby , mom . even with mike &apos;s help .
thank you for letting me stay .
of course . fresh squeezed and full of folic acid .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i thought about what you said last night .
ok .
and i know you have the best intentions , but ...
... i can &apos;t move in here with you .
why not ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re not this baby &apos;s father .
so ?
and we &apos;re not ...
we &apos;re friends .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m offering .
is friendship . and a hand .
look , raising a kid is hard on your own .
brandon &apos;s got three parents and sometimes that &apos;s not enough .
it &apos;s just until the baby &apos;s born .
and then you can get your own place and a full @-@ time job .
no strings attached , of any kind .
ok , on three . you ready ?
ready .
one , two , three !
that was awesome ! i want to do it again !
yeah ! after me !
you should totally try the rope swing !
ah ! maybe next time .
look at that .
fun , the good old @-@ fashioned way .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
where &apos;s hayley ?
she left .
don &apos;t worry , her mom &apos;ll be home when she gets back .
we also broke up .
what ?
well , did she say anything about my dance team ?
yeah , she said something about somewhere you could shove it .
hey ! hey , can we please just get along .
great . now she knows our secret dystopian robot theme .
hey , come in ! family swim !
oh , no , no , no .
this suit is dry @-@ clean only .
wait , no ! no !
yes !
here we go !
nice !
all right , who &apos;s next ?
no ! no pushing moms .
she &apos;s right .
only moms get to push moms .
are you ok ?
no !
don &apos;t you laugh ! guess who &apos;s going in next ?
no ! no ! no !
who wins ? me ! i win !
watch out !
sorry , mom .
