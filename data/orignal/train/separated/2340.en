For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now. I know the risk,
but I have to know her.
I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
Why are you here?
I missed my little brother.
He told me about your ex, Katherine.
She broke your heart.
That was a long time ago.
Why do I look like her?
Our love for Katherine, it wasn't real.
Katherine never compelled me.
It's real for me.
Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
Technically I'm a witch.
That noise.
Wait, what noise?
Tyler!
What the hell?!
We need some help over here!
Caroline!
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
What is it?
It's your dad.
He's dead.
You decided that I was worth saving,
and I wanted to thank you...
For that.
Anna!
Here. It's my blood.
If you die with it in your system,
you'll come back.
Anna's dead. I saw her killed.
I know you cared about her.
Yeah, I did.
You scared me.
Sorry.
Is Jenna home?
She had to meet the fire chief about the building.
She doesn't know the truth.
They've covered it up.
Yeah, I know. How's Jeremy?
Holed up in his room.
I looked everywhere.
What do you think, someone stole it?
Yeah. Someone definitely took my stuff.
Can I help?
Sure.
Do you want me to pick you up?
I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
You bet.
Ok.
I love you, Stefan.
I love you, too.
Katherine!?
Hello, John. Goodbye, John.
Jeremy?
You up?
911, what's your emergency?
Hi, I need an ambulance to 2104 Medford street.
Behind you!
What?
Behind you!
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Please, Jeremy, wake up!
He's ok.
What happened?
He said that Anna gave him her blood,
and then he took these pills.
And now, I mean, he looks fine.
But then again so do you.
So I just-- I don't know.
Come here, look at me.
No, I'm fine, ok? I feel exactly the same.
Should I call a paramedic up here? What should I do?
No.
He's fine.
So you mean I'm not a vampire?
Damn it.
Don't say that.
Jeremy--Jeremy, why would you want that?
Did you hear about Anna, what happened to her tonight?
She's dead.
Jeremy, Jeremy, come here, sit down.
I am very sorry about Anna.
But it's very important that you listen to me right now.
With every passing moment,
Anna's blood is leaving your system.
If you tried to kill yourself right now,
you could really die.
Hey! Do you understand me?
Stefan...
Yeah. I understand.
Good.
What about the pills that he took?
He didn't take enough to die.
So Anna's blood actually healed him of that.
Ms. Gilbert.
I'll be right there.
You need to be at the hospital.
But...
No, no, I'll stay here with Jeremy.
No, I don't need a baby-sitter.
Yes, you do.
How's Caroline?
She's not good, Bon.
What happened?
We were driving and Tyler heard this noise.
And he got--he got like this migraine or something.
And he lost control of the car.
And I thought that Caroline was fine,
And then--and then she wasn't, so...
Liz.
I came as soon as I got the message.
Is she ok?
She's in surgery. It's...
They're doing everything they can.
I need your help, Damon.
Sure. Anything, Liz.
Mayor Lockwood is dead.
They thought he was a vampire.
They put him in the basement.
Mayor Lockwood was a vampire?
No, no, no. A mistake was made.
They said he dropped like the others
when John's device went off, but he...
He couldn't have been a vampire!
I've known the man my whole life.
And now Carol Lockwood is going to want answers,
And all I can think about right now is Caroline.
And--and, um...
It's ok. Hey.
It's ok.
Bonnie.
How's Caroline?
She's weakened.
They don't know if she's going to make it.
What?
Is there something that you can do?
Like a spell or something?
She doesn't know how.
Do you?
No. I don't.
No, you don't. Because it took
Emily years to learn a spell like that.
Oh, well, I can take down a vampire.
That spell was easy to learn.
I can give Caroline some blood.
No. No way.
No, no, no, just enough to heal her.
She'll be safe in the hospital,
and it'll be out of her system in a day.
She'll be better, Elena.
It's too risky.
I can't agree to that.
Do it.
This is Caroline.
Ok? We can't let her die.
Do it.
If I do this, you and me, call a truce.
No. But you'll do it anyway.
For Elena.
Uh--all right, I know this is probably
the last thing you want to do right now,
but we should talk about what happened tonight.
Yeah, one of the tomb vampires
got into the house and almost killed John!
What? What--when?
What are you talking about, after I left?
You were there?
Come on, Elena,
You know I was.
When were you at the house?
Really?
Earlier.
On the porch. We were talking,
All cathartic, feelings exposed.
Come on, we kissed, Elena.
Ok...I don't have time for this, Damon.
Hey. If you want to forget it happened, fine.
But I can't.
Elena! I came as soon as I got your message.
How is John?
Where have you been?
At the fire department.
I had to fill out a report.
I told you earlier.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
No, Jenna, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Mmm, you gotta be kidding me.
How's Caroline?
Not good.
Just what I needed.
Katherine.
At least I fooled one of you.
Feel better?
Stefan?
Elena.
What happened?
Katherine happened.
Did she say what she wanted?
No.
Woman certainly knows how to make an entrance.
She said she fooled one of us at least.
What does that-- what does that mean?
She pretended to be Elena, too,
when I showed up earlier tonight.
I told Jeremy.
I can't lie to him anymore.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.
I thought that with all the tomb vampires gone,
things would be better.
I know.
We all did.
Katherine was in this house.
that means that she's been invited in.
What are we going to do?
Move.
Very helpful. Thank you.
Katherine wants you dead,
there's zero you can do about it,
you would be dead. But you're not.
So clearly she has other plans.
Right, and we need to find out what those other plans are
and not provoke her in the process.
What happened tonight
when you thought she was Elena?
To risk another... frown line
encroaching on a very crowded forehead...
We...kissed.
And you thought it was me?
What do you mean, you kissed?
Well, you know,
When two lips pucker, and they--
Don't be obvious, Stefan.
Stefan, wait, he kissed Katherine.
Not me.
I wouldn't do that.
We don't have time for this, guys.
Later.
Jonh must know something.
There has to be a reason why Katherine tried to kill him.
She's Katherine.
She loves to play games, and you're fooling yourself
if you think you're going to find out what she's up to
before she wants you to know.
No, actually, Elena's right.
Jonh could know something through Isabelle.
Your mother, she was in touch with Katherine,
so maybe we can go to the hospital.
And talk.
I've got a better idea.
What's that?
I'm just going to ignore the bitch.
See ya.
Is that smart?
If Katherine thinks she's being ignored,
It'll lure her out. She'll make a move.
Yeah? Then what?
Stake her, rip her head off.
Something poetic.
We'll see.
You been here all night?
Yeah, with the sheriff.
And no one else?
Stefan's brother Damon stopped by late last night.
How is Caroline today?
See for yourself.
"Jersey Shore" is on.
Ooh, careful!
I'm still a little sore.
I'm sorry.
It's ok.
But they say I'm healing really quick now.
Isn't he cute?
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy you're ok.
Well, I love you guys!
We love you.
I want to know exactly who's responsible for killing my husband.
I'm looking into it.
You have to be straight with me.
Is there any reason Richard was affected by the vampire device?
What are you implying? That he was one of them?!
No, no, no one's implying that.
Your deputy screwed up, plain and simple.
Which makes you responsible.
Carol--
Your husband is the one
who helped Jonh Gilbert execute his idiot plan in the first place!
Liz--
Someone got my husband killed.
We're all on edge here.
You suffered a great loss.
The whole town has.
We have to stick together.
Ok, trust each other.
We'll get through this.
So the black sheep returns.
Tyler?
Yeah.
What happened to you?
In my mind, you're 12 years old.
Well, that's 2 years older
than the last time you saw me, uncle Mason.
Good to see you again.
It's good to see you, too.
Come inside.
Ready for this?
John?
I'm Elena, I'm not-- I'm not Katherine.
We know she did this to you.
We need to know why.
Where is she?
You tell us.
I don't know.
You're a little too weak to play tough guy.
Why don't you just sit back,
answer a few questions.
Please.
Tell us why she's here.
What does she want?
She'll try again.
We can't help you if you don't
Confide in us.
In you?
In your daughter, then.
My daughter should have driven a stake through your heart by now.
I haven't spoke with katherine directly.
She never trusted me.
So either kill me, or get out.
Because I can't stand the sight of you with my daughter.
You see the problem with such hatred?
It's gonna get you killed.
You may be ok with dying, but I have a better plan for you.
You now have my blood in your system.
All I have to do is kill you.
Now take my advice--
Leave town. Elena doesn't want you here.
You have about 24 hours before the blood leaves your system.
That's enough time to disappear.
Or so help me god, I will turn you into a vampire
and I will watch you hate yourself more than you already do.
Clock starts now.
Who's the guy with Carol?
That's mayor's younger brother, Mason Lockwood.
Is he on the council?
Like John Gilbert was when he rolled in?
He's nothing like John.
For one, he's not an ass.
He's not a believer, either.
He wants nothing to do with the council.
He's too preoccupied finding the perfect wave.
Hmm. Thanks.
See ya.
Hey, Elena.
Thanks for coming.
Come on in.
Hey. I just have to swing by home
and pick up Jenna and Jeremy so we can go to the lockwoods.
How did you leave it in there with John?
I, uh...
I asked him to leave town.
Asked?
You threatened him.
Yeah, I threatened him.
Good.
I want him gone, Stefan.
I know that I shouldn't feel that way,
but I don't want someone like that in my life.
Or Jeremy's life.
I know, I know.
So what now?
Now...
I need to go find Damon.
Please, Stefan, don't fight with him.
No, Elena, he tried to kiss you. I'm not ok with that.
That's not the problem.
Katherine is.
She's already messing with both of your heads,
and Damon's not stable when it comes to her.
Last thing we need is to make things worse.
Did you know the Gilbert device
affected Tyler Lockwood?
I know it took the mayor down.
Don't you want to know why?
Yes, Bonnie, I would love to know why
a non-vampire
was tortured by the vampire torture device
that you let John Gilbert use against us.
Speaking of your guilt, how's Caroline?
She's much better.
You're welcome.
No, you're welcome.
How am I welcome?
You'll live to see another day.
No good deed goes unpunished with you, does it?
Doesn't undo the bad.
I know what you are, Damon. You might have Elena
And the sheriff and everybody else fooled, but not me.
Hmm. One wrong move,
and I'm gonna take you out.
Now you need to stop with the witch's brew.
You're starting to believe your own press.
I'm sorry.
You were saying?
Oh, god.
Damon drives me crazy.
He's walking around like he's some kind of hero
for healing Caroline, when it's his fault
all this happened in the first place.
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
What Damon's done is just awful.
Ok.
Better. Hateful Damon moment over.
Thanks.
I gotta find Tyler and pay my respects.
I'll be back.
Ok.
Hello?
Elena, where are you?
Bonnie, I know.
I'm late. I'm getting in the car now.
I'll be there in five.
We haven't officially met.
I'm Katherine.
I know who you are.
Of course you do.
You're the best friend, right?
I've been putting all the pieces of Elena's life together.
Isabelle told me it was a bit of a puzzle.
I do know who Jenna and Jeremy are.
And I've met that delicious ex-boyfriend Matt,
who's sweet on Caroline,
and then there's you,
The vampire hating Bennett witch.
Did I do good?
I've been around a long time, Bonnie.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Nice.
Katherine.
Stefan.
Leave her alone.
Ok.
What are you doing here?
After the way you treated me last night,
I thought that a public place would be less violent.
Taking this a little far, don't you think?
Elena could walk in at any moment.
Mmm, but that's part of the fun, Stefan.
Damon's here, somewhere.
I've been avoiding him.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Matt.
I, uh, I heard that Caroline was doing much better.
Her recovery was practically miraculous.
You must be so relieved.
I am.
Thanks, Elena.
His eyes are so blue.
You need to leave now.
You're hurting my feelings, Stefan.
Damon was much happier to see me.
Then again, he thought I was your girlfriend.
So. Katherine, I'm not doing this with you.
Ok, how about we don't have a couple's fight
in front of all your friends.
Walk with me?
Just tell me what you're doing here.
Maybe I missed you.
Is that an acceptable reason?
What game are you playing?
Why, you want to play with me?
I don't know.
How can I play if I don't know the rules?
No rules, Stefan.
Don't you remember?
No rules.
Looks like the whole town has turned out.
Yeah, well, he is--
He was the mayor.
Why don't they save it for the funeral?
It's what people do.
The Lockwoods were here for us when we went through this.
It'll be quick.
We'll drop off the food and pay our respects and go.
In and out? Sounds like a plan.
You guys go ahead.
I'll, um, I'll be right there, ok?
Hey. How are you doing?
Great, Elena. Walkin' on sunshine.
Thanks for asking.
Damon...
Elena...
We should be able to talk about this.
Damon, we're close enough now.
I really want to know how you're doing.
I kissed you, I thought you kissed me back.
Doppelganger hijinks ensued.
How do you think I'm doing?
I think that you're hurt.
Hmm. Oh, I don't get hurt, Elena.
No, you don't admit that you get hurt.
You get angry and cover it up,
and then you do something stupid.
You're scared.
You think Katherine's going to send me
off the deep end, don't you?
I don't need to hurt for that.
You know, why--
Why is it such a surprise
that I would kiss you?
That's not a surprise.
I'm surprised that you thought I would kiss you back.
Now I'm hurt.
Elena!
Bonnie, what happened?
Oh, hey, sorry. I was just looking for the, uh--
The bathroom's down the hall.
Hey, look, I'm--
I'm sorry about your dad.
Today's been a big day of sorrys
from people who really don't give a crap.
I remember when my dad died,
I had a house full of strangers
telling me what a great guy he was.
Anyway, I know how hard all this is.
Difference is, in your case, it was true.
My dad was a dick.
Yeah, yeah, he was.
I found this in his desk.
He won't mind, he's dead.
Yeah, you know what, sure.
Why not.
Hey, what's going on in here, Tyler?
Nothing. Nothing.
You got somewhere else to be?
The Lockwoods have a lot more land than they used to.
The possessions of all the tomb vampires
built them quite a fortune.
Yeah, why did you want them dead, hmm?
You're the one who turned most of them.
There's nothing more annoying
than a vengeful vampire, Stefan.
Just ask John Gilbert.
You haven't changed at all, have you?
But you have.
You're stronger.
Meaner. It's sexy.
Don't flirt with me, Katherine.
I'm not Damon.
I haven't spent 145 years obsessed with you.
Yeah.
Based on your choice of women,
I'd say otherwise.
Though I'll admit,
It does bother me that you've fallen in love with somebody else.
I was never in love with you, Katherine.
You compelled me.
So none of my feelings were real.
Believe what you want, Stefan.
But I know the truth.
And deep down, so do you.
The truth? Mm-hmm.
Well, the truth is, you're the same
lying, selfish,
manipulative bitch that you've always been.
So whatever it is that you're doing here,
why don't you just get on with it and leave town.
Because if you don't,
I will hunt you down and I will rip your heart out.
You want to know why I'm here, Stefan?
I came back for you.
Well, the problem, Katherine...
is that I hate you.
You hate me, huh?
That sounds like the beginning of a love story,
Stefan, not the end of one.
Are you gonna be ok?
Yeah. It'll heal.
That's not what I meant.
I was trying to figure her out.
I was playing along, I let her get to me.
We tried to track her,
but she's gone. Ooh, cover up, fabio.
We got a crazy ex on the loose.
Better watch out,
looks like Katherine's trying to steal your guy.
That's not what's happening.
Isn't it? I mean, it's only fair, since I...
went after your girl.
I'm gonna go check on Jenna and Jeremy.
Let me know when you guys are done.
So what's it going to be, huh?
Fight to the death.
Go ahead, take your threats, stake your claim.
I'm not going to fight you.
Why?! I'd fight me.
Katherine's going to try to play us against each other.
You do know that, right?
Brother, don't you worry.
Our bond is unbreakable!
We need to stay united against her.
So, yes, as much as I would like to kill you,
I'm not going to fight you.
I kissed Elena.
Because you feel something for her.
Because you actually care.
And I'm not going to let Katherine
come in here and destroy that part of you
that has finally, after all of this time,
willing to feel something.
She'll try to break you.
She'll try to break us.
And how we respond to that will define us.
It's our choice.
So, no. I'm not going to fight you.
Jeremy.
What are you doing here?
I'm packing.
Leaving.
So you figured you'd kill all your evil vampires,
and then you'd leave town?
Not all, but enough. For now.
Can you tell Elena I said good-bye?
Why don't you tell her yourself?
You know, Jeremy, I was taught to hate them.
The vampires.
It's what I know. It's what your father knew.
My father would have seen things differently.
No, he may have done things differently,
but there's no other way to see it.
That ring on your finger, the one that's supposed to protect you,
that was my father's, right?
Yeah.
Then why didn't it protect him? Why is he still dead?
What happened to your parents wasn't supernatural.
It was an accident.
There's nothing that can save us from that.
I wonder what he'd think of all this,
of me.
He'd think that you're still young.
You're still finding yourself.
But you are a Gilbert,
and you've been exposed to this town's darkest secret,
and with that comes responsibility.
I don't believe in that family legacy stuff.
Sooner or later, you'll have to.
Tyler!
What are you doing?
I hate him.
Oh, don't say that!
Let go of me!
Get off me! Hey!
Tyler! Hey, hey!
I said get off me!
Tyler!
Get off me!
Look at me. Look at me.
Calm down.
Settle down.
Very brave of you to come here.
I wanted to say good-bye.
Leaving so soon?
I know where I'm not wanted.
Don't pout.
It's not attractive on a woman your age.
What, no good-bye kiss?
Why don't I kill you instead?
What are you doing here?
Nostalgia, curiosity, et. cetera.
I'm better at the enigmatic one-liners, Katherine.
What are you up to?
Trust me, Damon. When I'm up to something,
You'll know it.
Come on. Kiss me.
Or kill me.
Which will it be, Damon?
We both know that you're only capable of one.
My sweet, innocent Damon.
That's more like it.
Wait.
Brief pause.
I have a question.
Answer it, and it's back to fireworks
and rocket's red glare.
Answer it right, and...
I'll forget the last 145 years I've spent missing you.
I'll forget...
How much I loved you. I'll forget everything
and we can start over.
This can be our defining moment.
Because we have time.
That's the beauty of eternity.
I just need the truth, just once.
Stop.
I already know your question.
And its answer.
The truth is...
I've never loved you.
It was always Stefan.
You scared me.
Just doing my part in the neighborhood watch.
Thanks.
For, um,
Looking out for us. For me.
That's me, your trusty bodyguard.
Calm in a crisis.
Have you been drinking?
And you're upset.
That's not a good combination.
No, I'm not upset.
Upset is an emotion specific to those who care.
Come on, Damon. That's a lie.
You care.
You're surprised that I thought you would kiss me back?
You can't imagine that I'd believe that you'd want to?
Damon...
That what we've been doing here
Means something?
You're the liar, elena.
There is something going on between the two of us,
And you know it. And you're lying to me,
And you're lying to Stefan, and most of all,
You're lying to yourself.
I can prove it.
No...
Damon, don't!
What's wrong with you?!
Lie about this.
Stop it.
You're better than this, come on.
That's where you're wrong.
No, no, no, Damon!
I care about you. Listen to me, I care about you.
I do, but... I love Stefan.
It's always going to be stefan.
Elena, what's going on here?
Nothing, Jeremy. It's OK. Just--
Just go back to bed.
No, it's not OK, Elena.
He wants to be a vampire.
No, Damon, stop it!
You want to shut out the pain?
It's the easiest thing in the world.
The part of you that cares, it just goes away!
All you have to do is flip the switch and snap!
Damon! No!
Your mom's out.
I think she popped a couple pharmaceuticals.
I didn't mean to freak her out.
I don't know why I get like this.
It's the curse of being a Lockwood.
So how did you get the chill gene?
I didn't.
I've just learned how to manage it.
I don't want to be like this anymore.
None of us do.
That's why it's a curse, Tyler.
He saw the ring, that's why he did it. He knew.
He didn't see the ring.
It's Katherine.
She got under his skin.
She undid everything that was good about him.
There is nothing good about him.
Stefan, not anymore.
He's decided what he wants.
He doesn't want to feel, he wants to be hated.
It's just easier that way.
He got his wish.
I hate him, Stefan.
I know.
Is he ok? Stefan, is he ok?
He's ok.
Shh. You're OK.
He killed me. Damon killed me.
Shh, it's ok.
Oh, god.
Elena?
Hi, Caroline.
What are you doing here?
My name is Katherine.
I was hoping you could
give the Salvatore brothers a message for me.
What are you talking about?
What message?
Game on.
