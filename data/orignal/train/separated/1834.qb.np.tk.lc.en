the surgical scalpel
is made of sterilized , carbonized
stainless steel .
this is a vast improvement over the first scalpel ,
which was pretty much a sharp stick .
medicine is constantly reinventing itself .
that means surgeons have to
keep reinventing themselves , too .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re doing this .
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
we don &apos;t do valentine &apos;s day .
there &apos;s more to life than the hospital .
no , there isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s romantic .
no , it isn &apos;t .
there &apos;s constant pressure to adapt to changes .
ambulance !
it can be a painful process .
eyes front , ladies .
but without it ...
okay , that seemed big .
if it &apos;s big , they &apos;ll page us .
it &apos;s big .
yes !
you &apos;ll find yourself moving backwards
instead of forwards .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
grandinetti &apos;s roof collapsed .
we &apos;ll be getting more than a dozen .
all scheduled procedures are pushed .
ugh . on valentine &apos;s day ?
god , grandinetti &apos;s must have been packed .
well , tonight &apos;s out . i told you this would happen .
well , that &apos;s why we went to dinner at 4 : 00
and exchanged gifts . look .
just special . original . magical .
squeals of joy .
wow . scrooge .
scrooge is christmas . that &apos;s a holiday .
dr. bailey . our hemicolectomy &apos;s pushed .
that &apos;s a shame . i was--i was really looking forward to that .
well , maybe we could make up for it .
dinner tomorrow ?
no .
um ... just ...
i &apos;m ... busy .
i have surgeries most nights .
i always have surgery .
right . well , um , maybe see you in the o.r. , then .
oh , my god . she likes him .
ooh , you like him ? oh , my god .
you should totally go out with him .
you have to say yes .
oh , no . it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day . you have to .
okay , see , that-- this right here ,
what &apos;s happening , the giggling ...
the girl talk , the omgs--okay , it has to stop .
i am busy .
hey , torres .
do you know anything about putting together cribs ?
you bought a crib ?
well , sloan &apos;s coming home tonight ,
and i got it put together , but it wobbles .
and it can &apos;t wobble .
now will you take a look at it ?
you &apos;re like a sweet , nerdy dad now .
i don &apos;t even recognize you .
well ... who &apos;s the blonde ?
i don &apos;t know .
i may be a dad , but i am a single dad .
excuse me .
okay . now--now i recognize you .
it must , uh , suck to work on valentine &apos;s day .
i don &apos;t believe we &apos;ve met .
aah ! what &apos;d you do to your hair ? !
i changed it . i @-@ i colored it .
i just ...
wait . you thought i was someone else .
you didn &apos;t know it was me and you were hitting on me ?
no , no .
i pretty much thought you were , you know , just some blonde .
you are pathetic and hypocritical
and slutty .
and you are no blonde .
you can &apos;t pull that off .
blondes are either badass or fun .
and you &apos;re ... you &apos;re a brunette .
damn .
shut up !
quit staring . i &apos;m probably gonna change it back anyway .
no , i @-@ i get it .
you get dumped by your boyfriend ,
and you go for the extreme makeover .
chicks always do that .
i didn &apos;t get dumped . okay ?
and i did not do this for mark . i just ...
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day , and i wanted to change something .
and--and i could change--
i @-@ i wanted to do something for me , okay ?
this was for me .
how is that different than what i just said ?
i &apos;m changing it back .
restaurant roof collapse .
yeah , so far--a penetrating abdominal injury ,
a sucking chest wound and a massive head wound .
also , there &apos;s an open fracture on the way .
do you want me--
dr . shepherd .
oh , you &apos;re still here ?
if you &apos;re here , i &apos;m here .
there &apos;s an osha investigator waiting in the lobby ,
and there &apos;s also two tv crews who are asking for a statement .
i told &apos; em to wait for you .
they &apos;re setting up outside .
we cleared the o.r. board ,

evaluate and page me if it &apos;s surgical . oh ! oh !
sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , let me see the chart .
looks like a pretty bad break .
you &apos;re gonna have to have that reset .
i wonder if there &apos;s any chance
you could put me in a bed next to that lady ?
yeah , sorry . it doesn &apos;t work like that .
of course . forgive me .
i &apos;ve been a head waiter for 25 years .
i know how it works .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
it &apos;s a depressed skull fracture with a subdural hematoma .
all right ? let &apos;s book an o.r.
chief .
yeah .
i need you to reassign some anesthesiologists .
you &apos;re being cupid for bailey .
i don &apos;t do that . i did that once , and she yelled at me .
i &apos;ll be cupid . you just be the chief . sign .
i am not cupid .
dr. shepherd , the reporters are waiting for a statement .
i have a surgery .
well , actually , dr . nelson said
he could take your skull fracture .
you &apos;ve got the trustee &apos;s breakfast in the morning ,
and when the trustees turn on the 11 : 00 news ,
it &apos;s your face they &apos;ll want to see .
watch it ! coming through !
i got the arm .

情人节惨案
can she have some water , please ?
i &apos;m afraid she can &apos;t .
my emile , stop .
my husband and i have been going to
grandinetti &apos;s for 15 years ,
every friday night .
and sometimes tuesdays .
emile always takes very good care of us .
but now it &apos;s time to look after yourself .
i just thought you &apos;d want someone with you
until you found out that mr . banks was okay .
thank you .
my patient &apos;s stalking your patient .
he &apos;s being a good waiter ,
and apparently , we &apos;re his busboys .
dude gave me 50 bucks to put him next to her .
he &apos;s got the hots for her .
her husband is in surgery . she &apos;s married .
you &apos;re just saying that &apos; cause you think you &apos;re married .
his 50 bucks says he makes a move .
you in or out ?
i &apos;m in , and i am married .
mrs. shepherd ?
huh ?
i &apos;m not mrs. shepherd .
you &apos;re not ?
i &apos;m dr . grey .
right . right .
um , chief shepherd wanted me to ask you about
the trustee &apos;s breakfast in the morning .
you shepherd &apos;s flunky now ? is that why he hired you back ?
i &apos;m on his service this week , and during this transition ,
he needed a little more help on the administrative side .
i &apos;m not his flunky .
so , uh , will you be going with him to the breakfast
or meeting him there ?
i , um , am not sure i &apos;m going .
what ? no .
you have to &apos; cause you &apos;re his wife .
sloan ?
when did you get in ? does mark know you &apos;re here ?
um , no . my flight got in a little bit early ,
and i just took a cab over . i didn &apos;t to bug him or anything .
somebody said that you guys have a free clinic ?
do you know where that is ?
is everything okay ?
oh , yeah . i just want someone to check me out ...
after the surgery and everything .
maybe give me an ultrasound or something ?
yeah , the clinic closed an hour ago .
come on . i have a second .
i &apos;ll take a peek for you .
okey , i need another 4x4 .
okay , dress him . i &apos;m gonna take another look at the arm .
this wound &apos;s completely macerated and contaminated .
why wasn &apos;t this guy brought in first ?
he was lying in dirty dishwater for a while
before they found him .
they forgot i was back there .
no , i &apos;m--
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not too big on talking to people , and ...
nobody talks to me much back there .
they just , you know , bring me the dishes .
i lost my arm .
i don &apos;t want to have one arm .
i don &apos;t want to be a freak .
i @-@ i don &apos;t like people staring at me .
we &apos;re gonna do everything that we can .
please .
okay , frankie , i &apos;ll take you up to surgery now .
we &apos;re gonna try and reattach the arm , okay ?
we have an o.r. i &apos;ll prep him , work on the stump .
you debride the arm , tag the vessels ,
and get it up to me as soon as you can , okay ?
okay .
wow . trauma room barbie .
okay , irrigation here and suction , please . so ...
here you go .
grandinetti &apos;s is gone-- a seattle institution .
hmm . dr. warren , you ever been there ?
couple times . good scampi .
place is so romantic-- perfectly lit , intimate ,
those cozy little booths , you know , in back .
a 3 @-@ 0 silk tie , please .
it &apos;s a little too intense for a first date , though .
bailey , where would you go on a first date ?
isn &apos;t there a dying child somewhere ?
no . i had some time ,
and i wanted to observe one of ... one of these .
baby looks perfect .
awesome .
um , can i , like , get that in writing ?
oh , even better .
here is a souvenir .
oh , um ... well , don &apos;t you have some kind of ,
like , official form
or hospital document that you can give me ?
why do you need an official form ?
oh , well , that &apos;s none of your business .
if you want your official form , it is , sloan .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s for the adoption attorney , okay ?
they need , like , a clean bill of health from me or something .
there &apos;s this great couple in san francisco ,
and they have these two big dogs , and--
an adoption attorney ?
yeah . i mean , i &apos;m not ready to be a mom .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m just not ready yet .
have you told mark ?
no . and ... you &apos;re my doctor , right ?
i mean , don &apos;t you guys have some kind of rule
that says you can &apos;t say anything ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna tell him , and neither are you .
do you think she needs an extra blanket ?
she gets chilled easily .
she must be one hell of a tipper .
sorry ?
well , i can see why she comes in every week .
i bet you take better care of her than her own husband .
when she first started coming in , before they met ,
we had a little game .
she would try anything we served .
she was adventurous ...
fearless .
when she &apos;d gone through the menu ,
i challenged the chefs to come up with something new .
it became ...
she became ... my favorite part of the week .
then one night , she came in with him .
she felt like this was a safe place for a first date .
that ring on her finger ?
the night he proposed to her ...
i placed it in the cream brule for her to find .
i watched her say yes from the kitchen window .
and they never stopped coming in .
but now he orders for her--
same thing every time .
for 15 years ,
i &apos;ve watched their conversations grow shorter and shorter ,
until now all they do is eat .
she has no children .
if he dies , she &apos;ll be ...
she &apos;ll be all alone .
she &apos;s so afraid . i @-@ i can see .
and all i want to do is take her hand in mine
and tell her she &apos;ll be all right .
she &apos;ll never have to be alone ...
if she doesn &apos;t want to be .
you &apos;ll let me know
when you have good news about mr . banks , yes ?
yeah . right . of course .
you can &apos;t leave without telling him .
yes , i can . i can do whatever i
sloan .
crap .
when did you get here ?
i mean , i thought you were gonna call first .
look .
oh , my god .
would you look at that ?
that &apos;s the sloan nose .
can you--can you see it ?
can you see it ?
it &apos;s my dad &apos;s . he has my dad &apos;s nose .
that &apos;s the sloan nose .
damn it . will you wait for me ?
i want to-- i want to take you home .
i got a surprise for you . oh , could i see this again ?
the sloan nose .
you win .
he &apos;s been staring at her from his kitchen for 15 years .
he &apos;s not gonna tell her now .
he just did . she was awake the whole time .
she heard everything . she has to say something .
well , she &apos;s not . he-- her husband &apos;s in surgery .
so ? they &apos;re clearly miserable .
i mean , did you hear the whole cream brule thing ?
50 bucks says she tells him she loves him , too .
you &apos;re on .
hi .
i &apos;ve got your keys .
what ?
dr. shepherd told me you might not make it home
before the breakfast , so i should just ask you
what you need from your closet , and i &apos;ll go grab it for you .
you are not going in my closet .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be a surgeon ?
he really needs you by his side at that breakfast .
i am a surgeon .
you tell the chief that i will be in surgery .
uh , so--so i &apos;ll just pick something out for you .
so ... yang &apos;s with hunt ,
grey &apos;s with shepherd ,
torres is with robbins ,
and you were with sloan until he dumped you ?
it &apos;s a wonder you guys got any work done .
he didn &apos;t dump me .
he forgot about me .
he decided that we were going to start a family
and didn &apos;t ask me .
he forgot i was even there .
he--he just ... left me lying in dirty dishwater .
what ?
nothing .
i &apos;m pretty .
what ?
in my family , i &apos;m the pretty one .
you know , uh , my eyes and ... my smile and my body .
i mean , you should see me without a shirt on .
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s kind of ridiculous .
but my family is smart , driven ,
crazy overachievers , you know ?
and they look like they &apos;re smart .
they don &apos;t look like me , which had its perks ,
except that my family treated me like i &apos;m pretty .
they expected nothing from me ... ever .
they never pushed me , never thought to .
so i had to push myself ...
hard .
i didn &apos;t even tell &apos; em i was taking the mcat &apos;s
till after i had aced &apos; em .
my point is that you can &apos;t just change your hair .
okay , you want to be unforgettable ?
you want to not be mousy ?
you can &apos;t just change your hair .
you have to actually change .
i &apos;m just saying .
okay , i &apos;m removing the glass ...
very ... slowly .
okay , take this . bovie .
nice work , dr. bailey .
dr. warren , can you believe that dr. bailey
almost left general surgery for peds surgery ?
did you know that ?
i did not .
yeah . no , she almost said no to general surgery .
but then she thought about it ,
and she changed her mind .
she wasn &apos;t afraid to rethink her decision .
she just needed to be asked again .
i see .
clearly .
do you have my report thing ?
no .
he took you in , he &apos;s given you money ,
he flew you to l.a. he deserves to know .
so if you &apos;re not gonna tell him , i will .
you paged me ? what &apos;s going on ?
you paged him ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
mark , she &apos;s--
i &apos;m giving the baby up for adoption .
i &apos;m not a mom . i &apos;m not ready .
and i want him to have good parents
and a good home .
no , don &apos;t . don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t give this baby away .
they &apos;ll love him .
they &apos;ll love him more than i will .
give him to me .
i &apos;ll take him . i &apos;ll adopt him .
i understand . i understand .
you &apos;re not ready , but i am .
and i know i @-@ i don &apos;t have the best track record ,
and i--and i should &apos;ve been there for you , and i wasn &apos;t .
but i will be there for this baby . please .
i want him to have a family . and , i mean ,
you &apos;ve been really nice to me the past couple of months ,
but you &apos;re not a family . you &apos;re just a guy .
sloan , please .
i &apos;ll help .
uh ...
i &apos;m right across the hall .
and we &apos;re a family , sort of .
and ... we &apos;re doctors ...
and we &apos;re best friends ,
and ... and we &apos;re good people .
yeah , we &apos;ll ...
we &apos;ll take care of the baby , together .
we &apos;ll love him .
really well .
just think about it .
go home . we &apos;ll talk about it .
can we talk about it ?
yes . yes , we can .
we can talk about it .
ooh , thank god . where &apos;d you get those ?
patient room . guy &apos;s in a coma .
he &apos;s not gonna miss &apos; em .
anything happen ?
he &apos;s still asleep ,
but she wants to say something .
oh ! oh , my god . i &apos;m starving .
ew . these are all half @-@ eaten .
now you can see what they are .
what are we doing ?
her boring husband &apos;s in surgery .
this dude &apos;s been in love with her for 15 years .
but she just found out ,
so we &apos;re waiting to see if she says something .
or if her husband croaks .
but it &apos;s okay if he does ,
because they &apos;re miserable .
i mean , is this what marriage turns into ,
running out of things to say
and changing who you are ?
probably .
yeah .
well , i didn &apos;t marry derek to be the chief &apos;s arm candy .
i &apos;m a surgeon .
yeah , you married him for the great surgeries .
i didn &apos;t do that either .
right .
you should &apos;ve .
ooh . shh . she &apos;s gonna say something .
she &apos;s gonna wake him up .
oh . what did she say ?
she can &apos;t breathe . get a crash cart .
she &apos;s got a big air leak in her chest tube .
what &apos;s happening ?
let &apos;s keep her on 100 % o @-@ 2 and get a bronchoscopy .
grey , see if an o.r. is available just in case .
okay . she &apos;s having trouble breathing .
we &apos;ll let you know more as soon as we do .
we saved the arm . we saved it .
we &apos;re ready .
it &apos;s gonna have to be an amputation .
what ?
there &apos;s too much devascularized tissue , too much contamination .
or we can push antibiotics and let the stump heal ,
but by that time
the arm will be dead .
page me when he &apos;s awake . i &apos;ll tell him .
they--they can &apos;t just leave it behind .
we could move it somewhere else , attach it to a healthy zone .
don &apos;t tell me , mouse .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just saying ...
temporary ectopic replantation !
well , you have--you have to keep the arm alive
until the stump heals .
yes , but in cases involving the elbow
it &apos;s extreme . he &apos;ll lose range of motion ,
grip failure
he &apos;ll keep his arm .
he deserves extreme measures .
if the arm is still viable ,
you can &apos;t just let it die .
has that ever been proved above the elbow ?
i don &apos;t know , but it could be done .
you could implant onto the epigastric
they can vena commitante .
give you a few days for the stump to heal .
i &apos;ve never done one .
neither have i.
so ? after today , you can &apos;t say that anymore .
okay , come on . i told him that we would do everything we could .
do everything that we can .
i &apos;ll call shepherd and let him know .
grey , avery , get ready to scrub in .
we &apos;re gonna be a while .
okay , that ?
not mousy .
you going into surgery now ?
there &apos;s this , uh , breakfast .
i know . i know about the breakfast
because there &apos;s some resident that i don &apos;t know
rooting through my closet right now .
sorry . she &apos;s a little overeager .
i @-@ i have a surgery ,
and i can &apos;t really give up a surgery .
no , i wouldn &apos;t want you to .
i mean , just to smile
and stand at a podium for the suits ?
it &apos;s ...
no , you shouldn &apos;t come .
i--you know , my patient , she &apos;s somebody &apos;s wife , too ,
and i &apos;m her doctor , and ...
okay ?
okay .
okay .
hey .
hey . i &apos;ve got a tracheobronchial tear .
transitory ectopic implantation .
wow . nice .
i rented a house . it &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s right on the water-- a little cottage .
and there are deer-- like &quot; bambi &quot; deer--
and--and singing birds .
it &apos;s incredible .
i @-@ i found this little secret coffee place
down the street from here , and , uh ...
and , oh , i @-@ i was thinking of getting a puppy .
but , you know , i--you have to be home with a puppy ,
and i--and i &apos;m-- and i &apos;m always here .
so i @-@ i went down to the pound &apos; cause i @-@ i ...
i wanted to get it out of my system ,
you know , the puppy love .
and i @-@ i held all of these incredibly sweet dogs ,
and ... you would &apos;ve been really ... really proud of me , owen .
i didn &apos;t take one home .
i went out and got a fish instead .
let me see . what else ?
oh , i got a bikini wax .
yeah , i got a bikini-- an actual wax .
you know , i haven &apos;t had one of those since--
you remember when i tried to wax myself
what--what is your point ?
you were my best friend !
my best friend who i could tell everything to .
and now you won &apos;t even look at me .
yeah , &apos; cause you said you love me .
you said you loved me , too , and then ...
and then you chose yang .
you chose her , too . you chose her , too .
i feel like i &apos;m cheating on her .
when i talk to you , i feel like i &apos;m cheating on her .
so i &apos;m sorry .
and i miss my best friend , too .
don &apos;t you have something else to do ?
this is the closest i &apos;ve been to inside an o.r. in a week .
last week , i would &apos;ve been paged in to help .
now i &apos;m paged about ...
fund @-@ raising brunches .
i &apos;m adopting sloan &apos;s baby .
it &apos;s the right thing to do . i think i can .
mm @-@ hmm . i certainly want to .
callie said she &apos;d help .
i &apos;m having a baby .
congratulations .
i &apos;m happy for you .
i &apos;m happy for you , too , chief .
it &apos;s what you always wanted , right ?
yep .
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve always wanted .
how is he , dr. bailey ?
looks like you &apos;re nearly done ,
and it &apos;s just in time for dinner
and maybe even some dancing .
if the patient looks good .
he &apos;ll be just fine .
he won &apos;t be dancing anytime soon .
but when the time comes
and he wants to go out dancing ,
he will be perfectly capable of
making that determination himself ,
without any help from anyone .
and i don &apos;t need any help here .
so if you are through helping me , you can go .
well , i just thought that
now .
she &apos;s nice ...
chatty
stop talking .
to be fair , i never said a word about dancing .
although
shh . what is all this bleeding ?
ah .
splenic artery &apos;s torn .
oh , he &apos;s gonna lose this spleen . okay , lap pads .
where &apos;s my patient ?
no idea . he must have left .
i need help in here !
ah . there you are .
i brought your wife &apos;s clothes for the breakfast ,
and i made note cards for your speech for this morning .
good . go home .
you &apos;re here , i &apos;m here .
honestly , i &apos;m happy to help with this stuff .
you are ? you want to be an executive assistant ?
you should want to do surgery .
that &apos;s all i want to do .
i &apos;m not sure i can .
i ... look , i &apos;m grateful that you hired me back .
it &apos;s just been easier to help out with this stuff .
it &apos;s easier coming back as that
rather than coming back as the doctor
who made a mistake and killed someone ...
killed someone &apos;s mom .
and i &apos;m not sure i can be that person .
so if you &apos;re not sure that you need me ,
then maybe i shouldn &apos;t be here .
dr. shepherd , i have a patient with an epidural bleed .
come with me .
you couldn &apos;t do it ?
actually , we could .
but , um , you need to prepare yourself .
we needed to take some extraordinary measures .
your arm needed a blood supply to keep it alive
until we could reattach it ,
so we had to relocate it to where we could get one .
is that my arm ? !
what did you do ? why would you do this to me ?
what did you do to me ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s only temporary .
okay , it--it-- just for a few days .
frankie , this is what you wanted .
you--you wanted your arm .
in the right place !
i said i didn &apos;t want to be a freak .
you should have left me like i was !
oh , come on .
did you even tell him you &apos;re leaving ?
look , i @-@ i just wanted a place to stay and some money .
i mean , i didn &apos;t know he was gonna care this much .
he bought a crib .
well , he &apos;s a good man ,
and he &apos;ll be very good to your baby .
you--you could know the baby
if mark raised him .
you could come back and visit and ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to know where to come back to .
i mean , if i give him to you guys ,
it &apos;s still my baby ,
and i need him to be somebody else &apos;s .
i mean , my dad got
a clean break from me ...
and look at him now .
don &apos;t i deserve that ?
prenatal vitamins are not a joke . take them .
and do not skip any doctor &apos;s appointments .
and ... if you ...
get into any trouble
or you have a problem with anything ...
call us .
just ... take care of yourself .
thanks .
mrs. banks .
how &apos;s my husband ?
there &apos;s been some complications ,
but dr. bailey is working very hard .
and i &apos;ll let you know more as soon as i do .
i @-@ is emile still here ?
emile is in surgery .
there &apos;s been some bleeding in his brain .
oh , my god .
oh , god .
he never said a word ...
for 15 years .
did you know ?
why do you think i kept going back there ?
but then i met bob ,
and ... emile never ...
i made a choice .
but you kept going back .
i did ...
because bob liked it ...
and i loved bob .
it became our place .
and , yes , he orders for me ,
because he knows what i like .
and it may seem like we have nothing left to talk about ,
but ... sometimes it &apos;s nice not to have to talk .
15 years ago ...
i made a choice .
and i keep making it every day .
that &apos;s what marriage is .
there &apos;s a lot of damage to this pancreas .
i can &apos;t get this bleeding under control .
okay , more suction , more .
the middle meningeal artery is completely severed .
what did i miss ?
i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve been literally watching this guy all night .
how could i have missed
you didn &apos;t miss anything . the first c.t. was negative .
there were no neurological symptoms .
it &apos;s the kind of bleed you never
know about until it &apos;s too late .
is it too late ?
i don &apos;t know yet . bipolars .
b.p. &apos; s 80 over 60 and falling .
push another atropine . damn it .
come on .
damn it . come on .
stay with me now . come on . stay with me .
come on . stay with me .
stay with me . come on . come on .
the dude waited on tables
watched his life happen without him .
he &apos;s probably better off .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t just--
i can &apos;t just watch people die .
i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have come back .
i ... i ...
listen ...
i made a mistake last year .
i almost walked away .
if you don &apos;t feel the losses ...
if they don &apos;t hurt you
and humble you ...
that &apos;s when you know you &apos;re not cut out for this kind of work .
you can be a good surgeon , kepner .
it &apos;s why i brought you back .
congratulations . you know , i thought we &apos;d lost him ,
but you managed to-- i can &apos;t talk to you .
right . um ...
look , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you and i might get to--
i can &apos;t talk to you . you make me nervous .
i ... forget what i ...
and i ... say things i don &apos;t want to say .
and i can &apos;t j-- i just go stupid .
i ...
i like you . that &apos;s all . there .
all right .
and so if you want to go to dinner , fine .
i will show up and try to talk .
how &apos;s tomorrow night ?
fine . i might have surgery .
well , i @-@ i might join you .
you can tell your patient her husband &apos;s gonna be okay .
what about emile ?
shepherd said there was no way to know it was detectable
until it was too late .
here .
i think this means you win .
i know . i don &apos;t want it .
well , i don &apos;t want it either . you would &apos;ve won anyway .
you think ?
of course . that &apos;s her husband .
grey . you ready to scrub in ?
i have a valve replacement .
you know , i ...
yang is still here . can she do it ?
we have to keep reinventing ourselves ...
almost every minute ...
because the world can change in an instant ...
hello , mrs. banks .
how &apos;s emile doing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
we did everything we could ,
but the bleeding in his brain was too severe .
i &apos;m very sorry .
thank you .
and there &apos;s no time for looking back .
all those people out there ,
they just want to stare at me .
they do . the doctors want to see you .
they want to ask you questions
because you &apos;re very rare ...
and special .
and there might be press ,
and there &apos;s a personal injury lawyer
floating around somewhere that thinks
that restaurant might owe you a lot of money .
how much money ?
sometimes change is good , right ?
oh .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i wanted to , before you got home .
and you don &apos;t have to do what you offered to do .
i &apos;m not gonna hold you to that . mark--
but thank you so much for offering .
and , uh ...
it could be kinda great , right ?
sometimes the changes are forced on us ...
what are you doing ?
sit down .
sometimes they happen by accident ...
oh , get used to it . i &apos;m keeping it .
you should . you &apos;re moving on .
i mean , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean that was a bad thing .
it &apos;s what you should do .
i hate valentine &apos;s day .
me , too .
and we make the most of them .
hey , owen .
hey . hi . uh , d @-@ do you have a minute ?
oh , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll wait in the car .
no , no , stay . it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s fine if you stay .
i said that i @-@ i love you ,
and it &apos;s out there , and i know that i can &apos;t unring the bell .
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m unringing the bell . i @-@ i take it back.-
i &apos;m gonna go .
no , no , stay .
i miss my friend , owen .
more than anything , i miss ... my friend .
the rest i can deal with . i can deal with it . it &apos;s ...
i have a job that i love
and an amazing student to teach ,
and i &apos;ve got a-- i &apos;ve got a cottage with deer
and a fish and various waxed body parts .
i &apos;m gonna be fine .
you and i are gonna be friends .
and you &apos;re doing a valve replacement with me in ten .
really ?
go prep 22 @-@ 19 .
okay .
we have to constantly
come up with new ways to fix ourselves .
you can &apos;t unring the bell .
i know .
but i &apos;m gonna try like hell .
so we change .
we adapt .
good to see you , chief .
good to see you , too .
hey . you didn &apos;t have to come .
i know i didn &apos;t . i chose to .
shall we go in ?
yes .
we create new versions of ourselves .
mrs. shepherd ? !
i know .
mrs. shepherd ? !
i know .
i don &apos;t do brunches ,
i don &apos;t miss surgeries , and i don &apos;t do valentine &apos;s day .
we just need to be sure
that this one is an improvement over the last .
you &apos;re gonna have to make this up to me with a lot of sex .
