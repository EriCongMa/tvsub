neal , you &apos;ll be running forever .
this is a way to set things right .
we &apos;re going home .
we &apos;re going home .
first day back . how you feeling ?
i &apos;m feeling pretty good .
i can tell . the limp &apos;s about gone .
there &apos;s still some tension ,
but it &apos;s nothing i can &apos;t walk off .
picked the right town for it .
casual stroll is the perfect excuse
to get reacquainted with new york ,
speak the city &apos;s language again .
what &apos;d the city say there ?
&quot; welcome home . &quot;
when do you sit down with hughes ?
the second we get in .
i don &apos;t like this .
don &apos;t start .
i go back to work ,
and you &apos;re placed under review and reassigned ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s only temporary .
i &apos;m the one who ran .
and i &apos;m the one who went after you
when i was explicitly told not to .
i don &apos;t know where they &apos;re sending me .
it could be organized crime , vice , vcu .
may not be that bad .
and you &apos;re fine with that ?
well , the timing could be better , i &apos;ll admit .
i &apos;m sorry . was there a better time for this to happen ?
no , but i was planning on reopening a case ,
and i don &apos;t want anything slipping through the cracks .
maybe i can look into it .
it &apos;s complicated , and it &apos;s out of my hands .
take the day off .
no , no . come on . come on . keep walking .
your new assignment .
you &apos;re sending me to the cave ?
it &apos;s the evidence warehouse ,
and it &apos;s the best i could do .
justice won &apos;t allow you to work active cases
until they sort it out .
what about neal ?
your team will handle him .
my caseload ?
jones and berrigan are on it .
&apos;cause you know this week --
yeah , yeah . i know how important it is to you .
look , another thing --
some of the top brass may be looking for an excuse
to shut you out .
don &apos;t give them one .
everybody wants you back here as soon as possible .
so , you know , work the cave .
keep your head down .
got it ?
i got it .
evidence . how bad can it be ?
you must be burke .
you must be agent patterson .
you can call me peter .
you &apos;re late .
yeah , i just got the assignment .
let &apos;s skip the small talk and get to work .
in addition to keeping this place running ,
now i &apos;ve got to babysit you
and file daily reports for your review board .
is that really necessary ?
your orders may have been open for interpretation
back at white collar , but not here , so get used to it .
okay .
you punch in . you punch out .
you arrive a minute late , you leave a minute early ,
you answer to me -- no excuses .
also , if i give you a deadline ,
you make damn sure you meet it .
one infraction , it goes in my report .
i understand .
this is my assignment ?
fresh batch of hot cellphones .
i need you to catalogue them by sim card .
no problem .
good .
bring in the rest of them !
yes , sir !
your deadline &apos;s friday morning .
welcome to the cave , burke .
am i interrupting anything ?
neal . what are you doing here ?
jones and diana gave me a lunch break .
i figured you could use one , too .
i &apos;d love one , but i @-@ i got to finish this .
all right .
how &apos;s it , uh ... how &apos;s it going for you ?
great . i &apos;ve only got 2,000 more to go .
you &apos;re sure you don &apos;t want a break ?
yeah , i do want a break .
you know , i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d have to say this out loud ,
but no convicted felons in my evidence locker .
you leave , caffrey .
just bringing him some take @-@ out , sir .
well , then i suggest you take it outside .
where ?
the picnic area .
sounds nice .
the sun is shining . fresh air . barbed wire .
it all kind of reminds me of ...
don &apos;t say it . ... - the yard .
this is not a prison yard .
you can &apos;t get french take @-@ out in a prison .
i got duck confit once .
wasn &apos;t take @-@ out , though .
it was fresh @-@ poached , actually .
i &apos;m not in prison , neal . i &apos;m reassigned .
and i &apos;m not making any waves .
that &apos;s the fastest way out of here .
which reminds me --
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
before i gave my statement at your commutation ,
you promised you &apos;d tell me everything .
when i said that , i thought i was gonna be a free man .
yeah , but you said it .
so start talking .
you already know about my dad .
yeah , he was a cop .
he was a corrupt cop .
ellen was his partner .
yeah . she also arrested him .
what &apos;d she arrest him for ?
i don &apos;t know everything , all right ?
burke !
someone spilled two full cases of seized ink cartridges .
i need you to get inside and clean it up .
you said i get an hour for lunch .
well , you were a half @-@ hour late this morning .
this is how you make it up .
to be continued . sunshine needs me .
good luck with that one . charmer .
hey , guys .
what is it , caffrey ?
this morning peter mentioned
that he &apos;d planned to reopen one of his old investigations .
i &apos;d like to see it .
we already gave you two assignments .
oh , yeah . your credit fraud . it &apos;s account takeover .
guy &apos;s changing the victims &apos; mailing addresses over the phone ,
then requesting replacement cards .
and the other one ?
bankruptcy fraud .
primary suspect &apos;s concealing assets
through a checking account in his second cousin &apos;s name .
look , it &apos;s my fault peter &apos;s been reassigned .
i know that .
the least i can do is try to help solve something
that matters to him .
you sure you want in on this ?
yeah , let &apos;s see the file .
okay .
light .
okay .
one more .
wow . that &apos;s , uh -- that &apos;s one case ?
yep . still unsolved .
for how long ?
20 years .
guess i got some catching up to do .
the bureau &apos;s been after this mystery thief for two decades .
are you up to speed ?
all right , his first heist was a securities vault in bushwick .
got $ 3 million in cash -- one @-@ man job .
five years later ,
he targeted a region financial bank in the bronx .
hit it for $ 5.6 million .
another five years goes by ,
he robs a brink &apos;s truck in transit
and makes off with $ 4 million in bearer bonds .
and we have no suspects .
we know two things , though .
first , he surfaces every five years ,
almost to the day .
if he sticks to this pattern ,
it means he &apos;s gonna pop up sometime this week .
that explains why peter was so concerned .
we got a small window
before this guy disappears for five more years .
five years .
he &apos;s waiting for the statute of limitations to pass .
he knows if he ever gets caught ,
he can only be charged with one crime .
no compounded sentences .
what &apos;s the second thing we know ?
at each scene , there was a specific tobacco residue .
no print , no fibers , nothing except trace amounts of this .
turkish harmony -- high @-@ end stuff .
peter made the connection .
he was assigned a bank robbery 10 years ago ,
found the tobacco .
he searched records for hits on the brand afterwards .
it &apos;s how he found the patterns in the previous heists .
after some research ,
he began to think it was all an inside job .
says here peter went undercover at the bank
for a few weeks after it was robbed .
yeah . cover i.d. -- peter morris .
he find anything ?
well , he &apos;s the expert . you should ask him .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
home . my shift &apos;s over .
clock says you have a minute to go .
really ? &apos; cause according to my watch --
you &apos;d be leaving early .
which would have to go into my daily report
for your review board .
now you can go .
have a good night .
exciting day ?
well , it &apos;s a thrilling tale
of a man &apos;s battle with carpal tunnel syndrome .
i hate to take you away from that ,
but i need your expertise .
you have a new case ?
one of peter morris &apos; , actually .
oh , that was a tricky cover .
i posed as the branch manager &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law .
made it look like a favor hire .
and i gave myself a little rap sheet .
oh , smart move .
you let your wayward history slip out during conversation ,
maybe you find someone like @-@ minded .
yeah , didn &apos;t get any takers or find any suspects .
it &apos;s pretty thin .
runway @-@ model thin .
but we may be able to get her a sandwich .
you have a lead ?
yes .
we ran a search on the national database
for turkish harmony .
you actually got a hit .
two days ago , a water delivery truck was stolen in jersey .
when the locals did their sweep
for the usual dna and fiber samples ,
they also picked up a few flakes
of the tobacco from the floor .
a water delivery truck ?
i know , it &apos;s strange , right ?
yeah .
any thoughts ?
yeah . check out the truck .
but that &apos;s hard to do when it &apos;s in jersey .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m in evidence ,
and you &apos;ve got a radius again .
yeah , right . we can &apos;t go to the truck .
so , diana made a few phone calls for us .
had the truck delivered to us .
you &apos;re in evidence now .
there &apos;s no harm in taking a look , is there ?
come on .
according to the report ,
the truck was hauled in directly after it was found .
meaning the last person to drive it
was the same person who stole it .
all right , we get inside , maybe we can deduce
the physical characteristics of the suspect --
height at least .
yeah , we get that , we can cross @-@ reference it against
the list of bank employees from your undercover stint .
yeah . one problem -- the truck was hot @-@ wired .
we don &apos;t have access to keys .
since when do i need keys ?
you don &apos;t .
all right , just keep that wedged right there .
not too hard .
be careful . this is still evidence .
a little more room .
yep .
got it .
what &apos;s the story ?
i &apos;m 6 &apos; 2 , &quot; and this seat
is way too close to the steering wheel .
so , i &apos;m guessing that our suspect is well under 6 &apos; .
maybe 5 &apos; 9 , &quot; 5 &apos; 10 &quot; at the most .
what do you have ?
well , according to the report ,
there were three water bottles missing .
yeah . he delivered them somewhere .
well , maybe .
i &apos;m more interested in how they were moved .
there we go . use the hand truck .
which he would have had to bring back
to the truck himself ...
and tie up .
left over right .
left over right . our suspect is left @-@ handed .
yep .
okay .
we &apos;re on the lookout for a 5 &apos; 9 &quot; lefty
who enjoys the occasional smoke .
it &apos;s a start .
i do not know how much longer i can work in evidence .
just cataloging phones and boxing up evidence
and filing endless paperwork .
do they know how many criminals you &apos;ve taken off the street ?
i think it &apos;s the one i left on the street that &apos;s the problem .
give me a second .
speak of the devil .
neal , it &apos;s late .
sure . come on in .
we got him .
what ?
oh , hey , elizabeth .
hey . enough chit @-@ chat .
who is it ?
all right .
dmv records show that seven of
your old bank &quot; co @-@ workers &quot; are between 5 &apos; 10 &quot; and 6 &apos; ,
but only one is a lefty .
how do you know ? dmv doesn &apos;t ask .
the signature .
when left @-@ handed people sign their name ,
their palms often smudge the ink .
david cook .
after 10 years , i have a suspect .
yeah .
and now we have less than a week
to figure out where he &apos;s gonna strike next .
do you recognize him ?
david cook was a bank teller i met while undercover .
i didn &apos;t like him .
any particular reason ?
he was a mets fan .
me being a die @-@ hard yankee fan ,
we went at it a few times .
type &quot; a &quot; kind of guy ?
yeah .
what does he want with a water delivery truck ?
the bureau will figure it out .
no , no , no , no . we have come this close
because of you , peter .
yeah , and if you need any advice , i &apos;m always around .
great . i want some advice .
how do we catch cook ?
competition , like i said .
he never delegated any of his work at the bank ,
like he had to do it himself .
oh , a control freak .
he never mentioned family .
probably avoids emotional connections .
that makes it tough to get to him .
cook did have routines .
he hit the gym every day , was always on time to work ,
and he always took his lunch at the same deli .
creature of habit .
yeah .
so find his latest habits .
ask hughes to get &apos; round @-@ the @-@ clock eyes on him .
we &apos;re gonna catch this guy .
keep me posted .
you know where you can find me .
all right !
good news .
hughes approved your idea for surveillance on cook .
we already got eyes on him .
he &apos;s got a weekly squash game at the soho health club .
i didn &apos;t peg him for a squash guy .
well , you haven &apos;t seen him in 10 years .
apparently he traded his love of the mets
for a more upscale sport .
i like the guy even less now .
nobody trades up from baseball .
is that a private call , burke ?
i @-@ it &apos;ll be done in a second .
second &apos;s up !
the only phone i want to see in your hand
is the one you &apos;re filing away . you got it ?
i got to go .
i &apos;ll keep you posted .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
oh ... nothing . that &apos;s the problem .
then what are you waiting for ?
go out there .
well , nice as that sounds ,
i &apos;m on very strict orders now .
yes , you &apos;re off @-@ duty , but you still have a badge .
well , technically , yes .
what rule would you be breaking ?
none of them yet , but this case -- i got to --
honey , i know how important this is for you .
so go be a part of it .
i want to .
i know . so see it through .
you &apos;re an fbi agent , peter burke .
go get your job back .
okay , we &apos;re live .
cook should be inside any minute now .
who are you texting ?
peter . i &apos;m keeping him posted .
thanks for the update .
what are you doing here ?
was out for a walk and saw a suspicious van .
wanted to know if there was
any illegal activity going on inside .
just a convict and an fbi agent watching tv .
get in here .
anything decent on the tube ?
we &apos;re wired into the health club &apos;s closed @-@ circuit cameras .
only blind spots are the locker rooms .
that &apos;s him .
oh , you catch that ?
he &apos;s being protective of that bag .
curious what &apos;s inside ?
i &apos;d be lying if i said no .
how about we find out ?
wouldn &apos;t it be nice if cook ran into his old friend peter morris ?
no .
what ? you were busted for larceny .
we &apos;re about to bust him for larceny .
you two have a lot to talk about .
what would i even say to him ?
you can ask him if he &apos;s stolen
any water delivery trucks lately .
good . subtle .
or ... &quot; how about a game ? &quot;
it &apos;s been a while since i played squash .
well , i hear it &apos;s like riding a bike .
from who ?
i &apos;m sure that someone ... said that once .
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;d need some workout gear .
shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
this shirt &apos;s kind of itchy .
it was all the pro shop had .
next time i spend 90 bucks for a pair of sweats ,
i &apos;d better get a free tv with them .
come on , this place is nice .
in fact , i &apos;m thinking of joining .
you get plenty of exercise .
it has its benefits .
yeah . so does flight from prosecution .
good cardio .
bring it ! yeah !
he &apos;s not messing around .
no , i told you -- cook &apos;s competitive .
good . use that to keep him busy .
when you catch up , ask him how &apos;s he &apos;s doing .
whatever he says ,
casually imply you &apos;re doing a little better .
if he &apos;s making money , you &apos;re making a little more .
if he drives a beemer , you drive a ferrari .
you want me to challenge him .
yeah , he &apos;ll try to one @-@ up you .
he won &apos;t be able to help himself .
you &apos;ll be on that court in no time .
then what ?
try not to lose too fast . good luck .
i &apos;m telling you -- you got to work on your backhand , man .
you &apos;re quick , but , uh ... ground strokes , baby .
better luck next time , friend .
dave ? dave cook ?
peter morris . we worked together .
region financial . been a while .
yeah . yeah . how you been ?
great . yourself ?
great . actually , beyond great .
i didn &apos;t know you played .
yeah , when i can get a game .
i &apos;ve still got the court .
terrific .
been a while since i left the bank .
what have you been doing since ?
i was gonna ask you the same .
started my own little business --
import / export trade .
profitable .
funny . i started my own business , too .
small financial firm .
financial firm ?
last time i saw you , you were mopping floors !
hard to get hired when you got a record .
that &apos;s some initiative .
you could say i took some time out , educated myself .
i tell you what , since we &apos;re both doing so well ,
how about a little friendly wager ?
okay .
winner takes a grand from the loser ?
a grand ?
that a problem ?
no , no . but let &apos;s make it 2 .
2 ?
not 3 ?
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s make it an even 5 .
you &apos;re on .
all right .
hidden camera ?
water @-@ cooler talk .
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
come on . move .
my shoulder &apos;s acting up .
i &apos;ve got an ice pack in the locker room .
is that your rotator cuff ?
eh , yeah . i pulled it before . it &apos;s not a problem .
you should be careful , much more careful !
where &apos;s your locker ?
it &apos;s just around here . come on .
you sure you don &apos;t want me to get someone
to take a look at that shoulder ?
what &apos;d i tell you ? it &apos;s not a problem .
shame we didn &apos;t get to finish .
yeah . yeah , it is .
you know , i &apos;m always up for round 2 .
that was barely a round 1 .
can &apos;t find that pack ?
it &apos;s probably in my bag .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
i just remembered --
you &apos;re supposed to use heat on an injury like that , not ice .
yeah , i read it somewhere . heat . heat .
well , i don &apos;t have a heat pack .
yeah , well , that &apos;s fine .
they &apos;ve got them in the pro shop .
you can get one on the way out .
heat .
hey ! you &apos;ve got green dots in your locker .
can i borrow one ? i &apos;m always out .
keep it .
thanks .
as a reminder that we have some unfinished business .
i &apos;m around for a rematch anytime you want .
yeah , you better be good for it .
oh , believe me , once i start something ,
i always like to see it through .
what was so fascinating
you had to force me into a game of hot potato ?
cook has a live feed running on his pda .
micro camera with a hidden transmitter .
guess where it &apos;s hidden .
inside water @-@ cooler .
that explains the stolen truck .
he used it to impersonate a delivery man
and plant the camera somewhere .
yeah , that &apos;s smart .
the live feed allows him to study his marks in real time .
what did you see ?
a diamond shop . i didn &apos;t get the name .
but i got a close @-@ enough look to sketch out the floor plan .
i &apos;m gonna go back to the office and draw one up .
peter and i will start narrowing targets from his place .
you can coordinate with me from the office .
six diamond stores in manhattan
are supplied by ram &apos;s water delivery .
cook could hit one of these any second now .
then he disappears again .
neal , did you e @-@ mail the sketch ?
yeah . sent .
making any progress ?
we &apos;re getting somewhere . thanks , honey .
ah , don &apos;t tell me that .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
jones , what &apos;s up ?
okay . keep searching .
cook just ducked surveillance .
team one lost him in the subway about 15 minutes ago ,
but they said it looked like he was trying to go dark .
he &apos;s pulling the job .
this is happening tonight .
all right , we need to figure this out now .
you guys have that list ?
yeah , i got it .
all right , well , we can cross off toback &apos;s .
christie and i went ring shopping there ,
and this isn &apos;t what it looked like .
plus , their security system is top @-@ notch .
you scoped out their security ?
ring shopping &apos;s not really my thing .
all right , you can also cross off davis ,
smith brothers , and solitaire and sons .
i &apos;d recognize the interiors .
because you cased them out ?
ring shopping &apos;s not really my thing .
all right , that leaves us with two --
midtown jewelry appraisers and crowder diamonds .
that &apos;s crowder diamonds .
i took a client to midtown jewelers last month .
they have two long cases of merchandise .
no vault in sight . definitely not like that .
honey , i have to --
you got to go . good luck .
i &apos;ll let the teams know the target .
hopefully we can intercept .
yeah , we &apos;re on our way .
you ride separate . i &apos;ll follow .
i &apos;m just an observer .
just give me a call if anything turns up , okay ?
what happened ?
place was hit 20 minutes ago .
no sign of cook ?
preliminary forensics shows a clean crime scene , so far .
and it &apos;ll stay that way .
all right . stay here .
keep me posted .
peter .
i can &apos;t be here .
i shouldn &apos;t have come in the first place .
yes !
it &apos;s all in the strategy , my friends .
i &apos;m gonna sit this round out ,
let someone else win some tugriks .
back so soon ?
well , no man is an island .
海明威 《 战地钟声 》 的主题
and you &apos;re clean @-@ shaven .
you have retired from retirement .
i can come and go as i please .
plus , as the man behind many a curtain ,
i found myself ...
lacking a reliable ... front .
so you &apos;re saying i &apos;m your front man ?
good partnerships are hard to find .
who are your friends ?
just some fellow travelers on this journey we call life .
yeah , they like my ice wines .
well , they are from colder climes .
what &apos;s the game ?
no idea , but i &apos;m very good at it .
deal me in .
the treasure ?
it &apos;s safe . how &apos;s the suit ?
i take it he returned from our balmy tropics
to much harsher weather ?
he &apos;s been relegated to the bureau &apos;s storage warehouse .
endless cages filled with contraband ?
it &apos;s not as nice as it sounds .
he &apos;s stuck itemizing cargo crates of stolen cellphones .
it &apos;s my fault he &apos;s in this spot .
i need to get him out of it .
solving this latest case will help .
what &apos;s involved ?
stolen diamonds .
we had a suspect , but he &apos;s gone underground .
has he liquidated yet ?
by the time the fbi finds his fence ,
those gems will be long gone .
well , who needs the fuzz when you have me ?
it &apos;s good to have you back .
neal . what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s about cook .
figured .
i &apos;m going over all the evidence ,
trying to find something we might have overlooked .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
i &apos;ve got an idea that will help you catch him .
you mean help the bureau catch him .
no . it has to be you and you alone .
it &apos;s the only way my plan works .
this is not my assignment anymore .
i can &apos;t disobey orders .
well , that &apos;s the best part . you don &apos;t have to .
look , peter , we can wait another five years to catch this guy ,
or we can take him down tomorrow .
it &apos;s your call .
what &apos;s the plan ?
this is cook &apos;s fence -- rina oaks .
i was able to track her down using a reliable street contact .
do i know any of these &quot; reliable street contacts &quot; ?
you &apos;d probably prefer not to .
i &apos;m sure .
cook is a competitive guy .
what if we give him a little competition
that puts him directly in our sights ?
i &apos;m listening .
your cover as peter morris is perfect .
he already thinks you &apos;re a convicted criminal .
what if you , uh , discovered
one of his contacts in the underworld ?
someone like rina ?
if we can convince cook
you found out about his fence and are making a better offer ...
we draw him out .
exactly .
he barges in when i &apos;m making the deal .
we have people in place to bring them both down .
the bureau gets a double win ,
and you &apos;re back in their good graces .
it &apos;s a nice idea .
but i have to report to evidence at 9 : 00 a.m. tomorrow .
good thing i made your appointment with rina for 8 : 00 .
all right . we &apos;d need real stones
to convince rina that i am a legitimate competition .
i didn &apos;t steal them . courtesy of june .
the canary is worth half a million .
the royal blue is worth another half million .
and the pink &apos;s worth $ 700,000 .
wow . i had no idea june --
yeah , she does okay .
so these two make up an additional 1.2 .
but cook has now over $ 4 million .
well , these should make you more appealing than cook .
they won &apos;t cut glass .
knock @-@ offs ?
the second rina sees them , she &apos;s gonna know they &apos;re fake .
she won &apos;t get to them .
all you have to do is buy enough time
to make sure cook crosses town and arrives at the shop .
meanwhile , you &apos;ll make sure rina only studies
the diamonds that are true .
how ?
pick one of those up . any one .
now turn it over .
how did you do that ?
from the minute you walked in here ,
i &apos;ve been subtly steering your mind
to focus on that royal blue diamond .
no , come on . tell me how you did this .
no , no . one thing at a time .
are you in ?
i &apos;m in .
what i &apos;m proposing is a three @-@ part plan .
so let &apos;s start with part one .
the first thing we have to do is draw cook out .
and that starts the minute you walk through rina &apos;s door .
peter morris .
yes , i got your message .
rina won &apos;t trust you at first .
she &apos;s gonna ask you for a reference ,
so you tell her you want to call a mutual friend .
david cook . he can vouch for me .
rina . we don &apos;t meet until tomorrow .
who ?
peter morris . says he knows you ?
what the hell is he doing there ?
making me an offer .
no , no , no , no , no .
no , you know what ? you stay away from him .
you keep him away from my money !
you mean my money .
i thought we had a deal ?
i hear what you &apos;re saying .
no , i don &apos;t think that you do .
morris is a liar and a known thief .
you don &apos;t trust him !
glass houses , mr. cook .
you understand i only have so much cash on @-@ hand .
code for , &quot; make me a better offer . &quot;
cook won &apos;t be happy to hear my name .
well , that &apos;s the whole point .
he &apos;ll think you &apos;re competing . it &apos;ll push his buttons .
and rina is smart enough
to know a good competition when she sees it .
hang on . i &apos;m on my way to you .
now we &apos;ll move on to phase two --
keeping rina around until cook arrives .
we &apos;ll buy our time making rina appraise the gems --
the right gems .
this is where you tell me
how you got me to pick the blue stone .
better . this is where i teach you how to do it yourself .
i began pushing you toward the blue diamond
by wearing a blue tie ,
which you &apos;ll also be wearing .
then i started making subtle gestures --
adjusting my tie , smoothing it out ,
drawing your attention to the color .
i can do that .
next i fiddle with my handkerchief , also blue .
impressive . and how did you come by these ?
that &apos;s not up for discussion . shall we get started ?
clever tactic .
but once she &apos;s done looking at the blue diamond--
you &apos;ll guide her toward the canary using a simulated trigger .
when i was describing our gems ,
did you notice how i pointed out the royal blue ?
you gave it a thumbs up .
right , i was indicating that this is a good item--
something you want .
satisfied ?
with this one ?
that leaves you with a five or six @-@ carat clear ,
the canary , or the pink .
getting her to choose the third diamond
will be the trickiest .
while she &apos;s appraising the canary ,
you &apos;ll start using muted word @-@ play .
when you and i were talking ,
i said a lot of words that rhyme with blue .
1.2 .
blue . true .
so , while you &apos;re steering her toward the last real diamond ,
you &apos;ll start saying anything that rhymes with ...
pink .
what do you think ?
so far , so good .
glad we &apos;re in sync .
when this deal &apos;s done ...
... we should go out , celebrate ...
get a drink .
i have a busy day ahead .
next time .
at this point , enough time has passed
for cook to make his grand entrance .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
finishing our game .
i don &apos;t know how you did it--
how you found out what i was up to ,
but i &apos;m gonna burn you for it , morris .
seems a little late now .
all the players are accounted for ,
which brings us to phase three ...
the arrest .
the arrest .
cook &apos;s inside the store .
all right , can we move in ?
once we have a visual on the diamonds .
i knew that financial @-@ firm crap was a fairy tale .
maybe so , but like i said ,
once i start something ,
i like to see it through .
this is the endgame .
how much is he offering ?
looks to be about 28 karats for $ 4 million .
i &apos;ll counter @-@ offer .
i &apos;ll give you 31 karats ...
but for $ 3.8 million .
i got eyes on the diamonds !
that &apos;s our go signal .
welcome back to white collar , agent burke .
hey , don &apos;t you have someplace else to be ?
you know what ?
this victory doesn &apos;t belong to me after all .
i told you those were the real deal .
fbi !
don &apos;t move !
david cook , you &apos;re under arrest
for the possession of stolen property .
thank you . secure the evidence .
where &apos;s peter ?
good question .
you &apos;re two minutes late .
i had to take care of something .
you were supposed to be taking care of my cellphones .
i know .
you gave me a deadline for this morning .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m impressed that you finished them last night .
it &apos;s good work .
thanks .
so maybe i don &apos;t have to mention you being late
in my report to your review board .
this time .
that &apos;s good .
so , cook told me you slipped out just before we arrived .
yeah .
you want to tell me why you didn &apos;t stick around ?
i had a job to do .
this was your win , peter .
yeah , this case has been nagging at me for 10 years .
i got something better than a win .
what &apos;s that ?
closure .
well , you should have gotten your job back , too .
can &apos;t have it both ways .
yeah , at least you still got your yard for now .
yeah , we call it a picnic area .
my mistake .
you know , you never did finish that story .
what story ?
the one about your dad , about ellen .
who was she to you ?
when my dad went away , my mom just checked out .
i mean , she was around but she wasn &apos;t ... around .
so , ellen looked after me .
well , how could she look after you if she was in witn--
you grew up in witness protection .
i was 3 when the marshals took us away .
what did your dad do ?
he admitted that he was a murderer .
do you know who he--
no . no one ever told me .
where &apos;d you go ?
the marshals took us to st. louis .
it was my mom and ellen and i ,
and they changed my name to danny brooks .
my mom told me my dad died a hero .
i grew up envying this man that i never even knew .
i wanted to follow in his footsteps .
in a way , i guess i did .
no , you didn &apos;t . you &apos;re not a killer .
no . no , but i &apos;m a criminal .
when i was 18 , ellen told me the truth .
she told me my real name was neal .
your mother &apos;s maiden name was caffrey .
well , i couldn &apos;t take his name .
not after i knew .
so that &apos;s when neal caffrey was born .
after she told me everything ,
i ran and i never looked back .
but now i want to know . i want to know who he was .
i want to know ...
i want to know if he did it .
ellen &apos;s here now .
go find out .
neal , if i tell you this ,
it may open doors
that i honestly believe are best kept closed .
you arrested him . what happened ?
one night i got a call from a fellow officer .
he said james had asked for an &quot; off the books &quot; meeting .
he wanted backup .
then what ?
by the time i got there , the officer was dead .
we found a gun with his prints on it .
he killed a cop ?
he said he was innocent .
did you believe him ?
james was many things ,
but i thought there were lines he wouldn &apos;t cross .
i investigated .
i was onto something big .
but then he confessed .
did he do it ?
it was a long time ago .
ellen , i need to understand who he was .
you said there were lines my father would never cross ,
but he did .
i need to know who i am .
