I can't. I can't. I can't.
Turn it off.
She's ruthless without her humanity, Damon.
When Silas was buried by the witch Qetsiyah,
she left him with the cure.
She knew that he wanted to die,
be reunited with his one true love.
Bonnie is the one that can drop the veil
between this side and the other side.
You will open the floodgates
for every supernatural being that has ever died.
Silas, show me your real face.
Now, why would I do that
when I can look like whomever I want you to see.
So what are we gonna do?
Lock her up, make her life a living hell.
You boys want to play games?
Let's see who breaks first.
Elena, you're here.
Hey, I got valedictorian.
You can help me write my speech.
Pass.
Oh, come on.
We're graduating this year. This is it.
We're gonna have to soak up every second before--
Wait. Something is not right.
I don't want to be here.
What is wrong with you?
Don't you want to be with your friends,
graduation parties, caps, gowns?
You know the drill.
What is this?
We're not really here, are we?
We're in my head.
Relax.
I just want to show you all the things
you've been missing out on since you took
the giant leap over the cuckoo's nest.
Last thing I remember--
Let me guess. Prom-- beautiful dress,
gorgeous hair,
you trying to murder Bonnie.
It's a good thing I was there to take care of you.
You starved me, you and Stefan.
Yeah. Well, we had to keep you weak
so I could bring you here.
See, the way I figure it is, if I can make you nostalgic,
then you're already halfway to getting your humanity back.
It's not gonna work, Damon.
Well, there are other ways to provoke an emotional response.
You still have her locked in the safe?
You've been in her head for an hour.
What, still nothing?
How you doing in there?
Come on.
Is the old you ready to come out and play?
Go to hell.
Ok.
Back you go.
We can do this the nice way,
or we can do it the other way,
But either way, we're not stopping
until you turn your humanity switch back on.
So I'm gonna let you think about that,
and I'm gonna come back for you in a couple hours
or a couple years
because all we have is time.
Where is she? I want to see her.
We're not letting anyone see her.
That's the whole point.
Isolation leads to misery, leads to emotion.
She's been here for days. She hasn't improved at all?
Look. She doesn't want to, Caroline,
not yet, all right?
She's devastated. She lost her brother.
She attacked her friends.
She killed an innocent woman.
You said that you knew how to help her.
I did say that. We are.
How, by torturing her?
It's not torture. It's an intervention.
The only chance we have with her
is to provoke her, to trigger something--
fear, anger, self-pity, anything.
Let me talk to her
before any more interventioning.
If she's weak, she can't hurt me.
Please just let me try.
Good luck.
I brought you something.
It doesn't have any vervain in it, I swear.
I just figured a little blood
might help you think straight.
For the record, I don't agree with what they're doing.
I mean, I agree that you need to turn your humanity back on,
but I don't think that making you suffer is the way to do it.
That's not who you are.
What makes you such an expert on who I am?
Because we've been friends forever.
I tried to kill you, Caroline.
I'm not exactly bff material anymore.
You should move on.
I am not going to give up on you.
This annoying, clingy thing that you're doing,
did it ever occur to you
maybe that's why both your boyfriends skipped town?
I mean, I know that Tyler said
he was running for his life.
Maybe he was running from you.
And Klaus... I mean,
let's just say it.
Nobody likes a tease.
Hey, I'm not judging.
Might be nice to have a bad boy ruffle those perfect feathers.
You're in pain. You're lashing out.
I get it, but you can't stay this way forever.
We're about to graduate and start new lives,
and you deserve--
Are you seriously talking about high-school graduation?
Caroline, do you realize
how pathetic you're gonna look
in that cap and gown pretending to be human
while your mom fake-smiles
and just counts down the minutes until you leave town
so that you can stop being a reminder
that her daughter is a repulsive,
blood-sucking, control freak monster?
It's really too bad
Stefan stopped me before I put you out of your misery,
but, hey, here's to second chances.
Elena?
Do whatever you have to do.
I'm gonna be upstairs.
I was wondering if you were gonna say hello or keep ignoring me.
I was working.
I see you compelled the bartenders again.
I'm celebrating.
My brothers and I have parted company.
Elijah and Nik have run off to New Orleans
chasing god knows what, and I am finally free.
Yeah. I heard about that.
Did you hear that I lost the cure to Silas?
I was this close
to the life that I always wanted,
and then, poof, gone in a heartbeat.
I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted it.
Please. I know you were planning on stealing it for Elena.
I never had a chance, did I?
I meant what I said,
but if you want to feel sorry for yourself, go ahead.
Why don't you stay and have a drink?
I can't.
I've got to go meet Caroline.
Are they still keeping Elena trapped in the Salvatore mansion?
I happen to like her just the way she is.
It's tragic that they're trying so desperately
to fix something that isn't broken.
Elena was my friend
long before she was your mean-girl sidekick.
So if you're upset that you lost the cure
and your brothers ditched you,
why are you still in Mystic Falls?
Some of us don't have the option of leaving.
Some of us are broke
and failing all of our classes and stuck here.
So why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town?
I would.
Bonnie, where have you been?
I left you, like, 90 million messages.
Studying French.
We still have final exams, remember?
Oh, don't remind me. Look.
This whole thing with Elena,
it's about to get brutal,
and I know that she's not your favorite person right now,
but I could really use you over here.
For what, moral support or so you can check up on me?
Moral support and maybe just a tiny check-in
to make sure that Silas isn't playing
any more pesky little mind games with you.
I'm fine, ok?
Silas doesn't control me anymore.
And I think I'll pass on the invite.
Elena tried to kill me.
I'm not quite ready to forgive and forget.
I'm gonna call you later, ok?
I got to go.
Lying, scheming,
and a secret rendezvous with moi?
Not very Bonnie Bennett-y,
especially when Elena needs her favorite witch.
This has nothing to do with them.
This is between you and me.
All right. Well, luckily for you,
I've got some spare time on my hands.
You said you have an offer that I can't refuse.
Well, by all means.
What do you have in mind?
Good. You're awake.
We thought you could use a little sunshine.
Looking for this?
Aw. You know the rules.
Bad girls don't get nice jewelry.
You took my ring.
I'm devastated.
And bored.
Can I go back to solitary now?
No. I kind of like you in the hot seat.
Whenever you're ready, brother.
Am I supposed to be scared?
You will be.
And when you are, focus on that fear.
It's the key to getting your humanity back.
You're not gonna burn me.
You don't think so?
No.
And even if you do manage to get my emotions back,
I'll remember all this.
And I'll hate both of you for it.
Worth the risk.
That feels better, huh?
How about a little gratitude
or any human emotion whatsoever?
And we can stop this.
I didn't quite catch that.
I said, I'm gonna kill you.
Bingo. See? There's a little rage.
I should have figured that'd be the first emotion that came out of you.
I tend to pull that out of people.
Elena, look at me.
We don't want to do this, ok?
You can stop this right now.
It's your choice.
Kind of funny, actually,
you being the one to pull back the curtain.
I bet part of you enjoys it
since, you know, I dumped you and all.
That was downright vindictive.
See? I think now we're breaking through
that tough candy shell
and getting into the ooey-gooey
rich center of your humanity.
This is good. I think we should shine some light on the subject.
Let me guess...
This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me.
Look, I know what you're going through.
After all you've done,
you're afraid to face the guilt you'll feel
if you turned your emotions back on.
The only way we can help you
is to make the alternative hurt even worse.
Oh, we have to keep talking.
If we don't keep talking,
then I won't be able to stop myself from listening in.
And I can't stand to hear Elena in pain.
What do you want to talk about?
I don't know. Anything.
I ordered you a cap and gown.
You did?
I just figured that you'd forget,
so I ordered yours when I ordered mine.
And I got one for Elena, too.
It's gonna work.
We're gonna get Elena back.
What the hell is she doing here?
I don't mean to interfere.
It's just I happen to know all they keep in this house
is blood and booze.
So I brought a peace offering.
Burgers?
Thanks.
Yeah, we can't really entertain right now,
but thanks for stopping by.
I think I might stay.
Matt mentioned that he was failing classes
and needed a study buddy.
You're failing?
Well, why didn't you ask me to help you study?
Well, I didn't exactly ask her.
Well, what classes are you failing?
I'm not failing.
I'm just really, really behind.
History and Italian and math.
Matt!
This year's been a little distracting.
We could both help.
"All hands on deck."
That's the motto around here, right?
We don't have a motto.
Look, if you need to study,
we're gonna study.
I'm gonna go home,
and I'm gonna get my flash cards and my study guides
and some energy bars.
This is gonna be good.
You dated that?
She likes projects.
Who's there?
Oh, my god.
Hello, Caroline.
Let me get this straight.
You want me to hand over Silas' tombstone?
What makes you think I even have it?
I know you took it from the island.
You're a scavenger. You'd never leave it behind.
So you're working for Silas now, huh?
Running errands for the big, bad immortal.
I didn't switch sides.
In two days, there'll be a full moon.
Silas wants me to harness its power to drop the veil
between our side and the other side.
He wants to take the cure, and then he wants to die.
I said I'd help him, and I've been hiding from him ever since,
buying time.
Time for what?
You don't need to worry about it.
You just need to bring me the tombstone.
It's a hunk of rock.
What do you even want with it?
The less you know, the better.
Silas is psychic.
He can get into people's heads, read their minds,
make them see things that aren't really there.
I'm taking a big enough risk just talking to you.
Ok. Then how do I know that you're not him?
You don't. But I'm not.
And what makes you so sure that I'm not him?
Because he can't get into my head anymore.
Because I am the only one who can see his true face.
What's in it for me?
Bring me the tombstone.
Help me stop Silas from unleashing hell on earth.
Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
You're gonna thank me for this.
After you turn it back on,
you'll realize life with no emotions blew.
You know what else blew?
Being sired to you.
Going every day believing that I was in love with you.
I remember every horrible moment of it.
And you...
So scared that it wasn't real.
Guess what. It wasn't.
You were right.
So go ahead. Keep trying to get the old me back.
Who knows? Maybe Stefan and I will give it another go.
I am the girl that you love.
You wouldn't do anything to actually hurt me.
You just proved that.
So what do I really have to be afraid of?
So that went well.
Every other vampire turns it on, no problem.
You kill. You feed.
You do all the awful things that a vampire does.
And then when you're done, you turn it back on.
Why is she being so stubborn?
Because she has nothing to come back to.
Her home's gone. Her family's gone.
She alienated her friends.
She destroyed her relationships.
No. She wants to come back.
Scaring the hell out of her should have worked.
She's smart. She knows we're not gonna hurt her.
All right. So we get somebody else,
somebody who really will hurt her.
Who?
Katherine?
Think about it.
She's the reason Jeremy's dead, right?
So if anybody's gonna provoke an emotion, it's her.
So we call her and then what?
Beg her to help us out of the kindness of her own heart?
You kidding me?
Katherine was just abandoned by Elijah.
She has nothing. She has no one.
We invite her into our house
to come torture Elena.
There's no way she's gonna turn that down.
Everyone said that you were gone for good.
That's true.
But I never meant to go without saying good-bye.
You don't owe me an explanation.
You're moving on. By all means, go.
That's just it, isn't it?
I never had any intention of moving on.
The truth is, I've tried to stop thinking about you.
And I can't.
Come to New Orleans.
What are you afraid of?
You!
I'm afraid of you.
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say
you're afraid of yourself,
your darkest desires?
Elena was right, wasn't she?
Deep down, you long to have your perfect feathers ruffled.
How do you know what Elena said to me in that cell?
Then again... There's so much to be afraid of, isn't there,
like what I'll do to you if your friend Bonnie
doesn't come out of hiding.
Where is she?
Silas.
Where is she?!
She's not at home. She's not anywhere.
Bonnie is playing games with me.
And I don't like it.
Tell her I'm looking for her.
Tell her to come out of the shadows.
Tell her that this...
is only the beginning.
What time will Caroline return from the train station?
That's handy.
Sort of a cheat, though, isn't it?
Not everyone's had a thousand years
to learn everything about everything.
I'm not sure how good I am at learning Italian.
I was fluent in the 12th century,
But languages have a way of evolving.
So can you help or not?
Of course I can.
Don't be cranky. I was just teasing.
I'm sorry. I just don't want to get left behind
when all my friends go to college
and I'm the only repeat senior.
The only reason that you are failing is
because you're preoccupied with training doomed hunters
and dealing with Elena's drama.
You need better friends,
like me.
I could compel you good grades,
get a scholarship.
I don't want to do that.
Why not? Everyone needs an advantage in life.
I could be yours.
When you convinced me to save April Young's life at the prom,
I realized that I could be a better person.
And I'm grateful for that.
So let me give you some advice.
Take advantage of what I'm offering you.
Make something of yourself.
For the record,
anyone who leaves you behind is a fool.
I wouldn't.
What a beautiful sentiment.
Seriously?
You can't knock?
Sorry. I didn't realize we were standing on formalities.
What the hell are you doing here?
You didn't get the memo?
I'm here to talk some sense into poor emotionless Elena.
Are you out of your mind?
You got a better idea, prom king?
Unless you want me to lock you up in there with her,
I suggest you shut up and let the adults handle this.
Well, it looks like the lunatics have taken over the asylum.
Where are you going?
I'm calling Caroline.
There's no way we're letting that psycho in there with Elena.
Caroline!
Where have you been?
Matt!
We have to get out of here.
No, Caroline. Caroline, wait. It's ok.
No, it's not ok.
Silas is out there.
And he made me think that he was klaus...
What are you talking about? What's Silas want with you?
He's trying to get to Bonnie.
Do you know where Bonnie is?
If I knew where she was, i wouldn't bother with you.
Now, get me Bonnie, or I'm going to kill someone.
Maybe I'll start with your mother.
No one in the house can help you.
Find Bonnie or I'll kill the person you love the most.
I know. I promised I wouldn't work too late.
Mom, I need you to get home
and lock all the doors right now.
Don't let anyone inside,
not even me because I have a key, so I can let myself in.
Do you understand?
What's going on?
Just do it, ok? I'm on my way.
Oh, honey, you look awful.
What the hell are you doing here?
Your boyfriends invited me.
They want to know if you still have a heart.
There it is.
Your bodyguards won't let me kill you,
but I can rip your throat out.
So I don't have to listen to you whine.
But first, satisfy my curiosity.
What did you tell Elijah back in Willoughby?
That's why you're here.
He dumped you, didn't he?
Now you're just looking for a scapegoat.
Tell me what you said to turn him against me
or I will feed you your own eyeballs.
I didn't have to say anything.
Look at you.
A self-obsessed egomaniac
on the run for 5 centuries.
What good would you be to anyone?
You're the definition of damaged goods.
No wonder Elijah left you.
Yeah, I've done some pretty horrible things to survive.
But unlike you, poor, delicate Elena,
I don't turn it off.
I deal with it.
You wouldn't last a week as a vampire
without everyone fawning over you.
But I'd love to see you try.
All that pain and torture of her took quite a thirst.
It couldn't have anything to do
with the fact that Elena called you out on your
recent boy trouble, could it?
Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.
Did you ever think Elena would have been better off
if she'd never met you?
You're trying to get a rise out of me?
Because my emotions are fine.
I love Elena. I despise you.
Mm, so romantic.
So doomed to fail.
You know, as soon as she goes back to her old self,
she'll go straight to Stefan.
That's the tragedy of you.
You never get the girl.
She's gone.
What?
Elena's not in her cell. I'm gonna check the grounds.
Find out what she did.
Did I forget to lock her in?
Let's just say i've lost interest in Elena's recovery.
I'd rather watch her tear through an orphanage.
Imagine trying to come back from a spiral like that.
Elena's gone? What happened?
Donovan, you're coming with me.
Why should he?
Because Elena's hungry and missing.
For once, his life might actually have a purpose.
Bonnie, why aren't you answering?
Silas isn't going to just give up.
You're the only one that can stop him. Call me.
Caroline, what's going on?
Mom, don't come any closer. Stop.
What's wrong?
I don't know how to tell if it's really you.
What if this is another trick?
Well, he can get in my head.
And he would have known that I called you.
OK, Caroline. It's me.
It's your mother.
I don't know what's happening,
But everything's going to be OK.
All right?
You just need to talk to me.
Hi. How's it going?
Oh, good.
Please help me.
Matt.
Thank God you found me.
Elena, stop. I know you don't want to do this.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
The thing about vampires is that we need to feed.
No, but you're more than that.
You're my friend. You're my oldest friend.
You're the girl that I've loved longer than I can remember.
Whatever wall you want to put up,
I know that still means something to you.
Deep down...
it probably does mean something...
but I am really hungry.
Bonnie hasn't called back yet.
I just don't understand why she hasn't called.
Caroline?
There you are.
What's going on?
Are you all right?
I've been calling you for hours.
Sorry. I came as soon as I got the message.
Caroline, let me in.
Let me help.
How do I know it's you?
Silas keeps getting in my head, attacking me.
He says he wants to know where you are.
He threatened my mother.
Caroline?
Mom, just stay there.
Caroline, that is not your mother.
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
Did you really think you could hide from me,
Bonnie?
I'm here now. What did you do to her mother?
She's right where you left her.
Mom?
Mom!
I thought you and I were on the same side.
The full moon isn't for two more days.
I've been gathering my strength,
preparing myself.
You're the only one who can do this spell.
So I can't hurt you.
But I can hurt the people you love.
You do understand that, right?
I understand. I will do your spell.
I will drop the veil. And I will help you die.
I promise.
Just don't hurt my friends.
Come on. Please. Please, please, please.
Mom...
Your promise is binding, Bonnie.
If you break it, you have to answer to me.
I won't break it.
Then you should leave this house right now.
And the next time I come looking for you,
I expect you to be waiting.
Come on!
Open--open your eyes, mom.
You need my blood in your system. Come on.
Mom.
Please, mom. Please...
Mom...
Mom?
Oh, come on. I barely drained an artery.
Come on. Get up. I'm hungry.
And my head's fuzzy. I can't think straight.
I need more.
Elena, stop.
But you're so good.
You're cut off.
Let go of me.
Stop it.
Enough.
You are acting like a little spoiled brat.
You know that?
You think that we can't punish you.
Maybe not.
But I can sure punish him.
Elena.
Seriously? You think this is...
Shut up.
I'm done playing nice.
Turn your emotions back on right now, Elena,
or so help me, god,
I will give you something to be sad about.
I will kill him right here in front of you.
Damon.
Don't "Damon" me.
If she doesn't love anyone, fine.
Prove it.
And if I'm wrong, what difference does it make?
One less bus boy.
Elena...
You're bluffing.
How about now?
You feel anything now?
You angry I just turned your buddy into road kill?
Or are you sad
that the guy that everybody loves is just a bag of bones?
Remember when he was a little kid, huh?
Warm heart, big, goofy smile,
His whole life ahead of him.
I guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this.
Oh, god, Matt.
You feeling that weight lifting off your chest?
That's joy.
Because your friend isn't dead.
That's emotion, Elena.
That's humanity.
You're gonna be ok.
No.
Look at me.
No. No. No. It's not ok.
Elena.
Whate I done?
No, no.
What did I do? I almost killed him.
Matt. I almost-- and then Bonnie
and Caroline. I just--no, no.
I mean, the woman, the waitress. I actually killed that waitress.
No! I killed...
that waitress.
Elena.
Look at me. Look at me.
I know this stage, ok?
The emotions are overwhelming you.
You just have to focus on one thing, ok?
No, I can't. I can't.
You just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong.
It's in there.
Just latch on to it.
Channel everything you're feeling
into that one emotion.
Find the thing inside of you that makes you want to live.
Elena, let it in.
Let it in.
That's good.
That's it.
That's it.
Just breathe it in. Blow everything else out.
That's good.
That's good.
You ok?
No.
I'm not ok.
But I'll get better.
Come on.
Ok, this will work.
Mom?
Open your eyes. Come on.
Wake up. You have to wake up.
You have to see me graduate.
I swear I'll get...
I swear I'll get you out of this town
and find you a nice man.
Mom!
I've never actually seen that ring in action before.
Does it hurt?
You mean getting my neck snapped
or coming back from the dead?
Because they both hurt like hell.
Did it work?
Well, it looks like Elena's emotional floodgates
have been burst wide open.
So she'll be back to her dull,
sympathetic self in no time.
Here.
That was a brave thing to do.
She saved me from drowning at the bottom of that river.
I'm just doing what I can to pay her back.
There aren't enough apologies in the world
for the part that I played in this.
Running you off the bridge,
Elena becoming a vampire to save you.
If you don't want me to cheat you into college, fine.
We'll do it the hard way.
But, Matt...
I will spend every day until graduation
trying to find a way to pay you back.
I'm perfectly aware
that tombstone isn't just a hunk of rock.
No kidding.
And it got me thinking,
all big spells require a source of power,
A recurring element like a full moon, a comet.
But that tombstone is filled with the blood of your ancient relative
Katsooyay or whatever.
Qetsiyah.
She was powerful enough to create the other side.
So maybe if you have her blood,
you don't need a full moon to drop the veil.
Maybe you can do it whenever you want.
The thing I can't figure out is
Why do you want to drop the veil at all?
I have my reasons.
And again, I ask,
What's in it for me?
You'll get the one thing you want most in this world--
freedom, survival.
Never having to run from anyone again.
Once I've dropped the veil,
I can speak to Qetsiyah.
She created the spell
that made Silas truly immortal,
invulnerable to any weapon.
You'd like that for yourself,
wouldn't you?
I can give it to you.
Bonnie Bennett, we have a deal.
There you go.
How you feeling?
The pain's still there.
The grief... and shame.
I get it now.
Shutting it off, it's a cheat.
I mean, you put up this wall
and shut out everything that makes you who you are.
Nothing affects you, nothing matters.
But things do matter--
Things that have happened cannot be undone.
And now I know there's something I need to do about that.
Elena, what you need to do is rest,
take it easy for a couple of days.
Maybe even a couple of years. Here.
I--I'm done resting. I have to get ready.
There's so much that I have to do.
What are you talking about?
Think about it. It's so obvious.
Go back far enough, there's one person who brought us to this...
Who ruined our lives...
And look at you two.
Everything that's happened to you, she did that.
She brought Klaus to Mystic Falls,
she turned Caroline into a vampire.
She killed my brother.
It all comes down to her--Katherine.
OK, Stefan said to focus on one thing, so I did.
I focused on hate.
And I hate her so much.
Well, I don't think that's what he meant.
Elena, Katherine's not worth your time.
Even if you spend 10 minutes of your life hating her, she wins.
