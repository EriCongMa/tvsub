i gotta have the whole story flow .
i &apos;m starting with the dialogue .
&quot; i manuged to get the drop on him &quot; ?

i have never seen you apply yourself like this .
i love movies . you know that .
that smell in blockbuster ...
... that candy and carpet smell , i get high off it .
gonna let all this love and knowledge go to waste ?
my cousin gregory &apos;s girlfriend , amy , who works for tarantino , said :
&quot; mob stories are always hot . &quot; i can make my mark .
with these indictments , shouldn &apos;t you put the script away for a while ...
... and get rid of evidence ?
travel light . free bird .
you stole this computer , plus the one you just gave melissa .
i &apos;m writing .
turn on channel 6 .
turn on channel 6 .
new jersey attorney general , james ricci , stated at a fundraiser ...
... that a grand jury has been impaneled to investigate ...
... possible mob activities in the garden state with indictments to follow .
with us is syndicated columnist and author of mafia :
america &apos;s longest @-@ running soap opera , jeffrey wernick .
welcome .
pleasure to be here .
for years , the fbi has been telling us that the mafia is all but dead .
let me interject .
while it is true that the mob is getting a standing eight @-@ count ...
... i wouldn &apos;t call the fight . the government knows this best .
murder , truck hijacking and money laundering are expected inquiries .
do we know names of those who &apos;ll be indicted ?
the indictments are sealed , but with the recent death ...
... of acting di meo family boss , jackie aprile ...
... my sources tell me that corrado &quot; junior &quot; soprano ...
... was made new boss after the death of aprile .
the sopranos have long , historic ties to the new york families .
what about possible murder charges ?
they will undoubtedly be focused on the as yet unsolved ...
... execution @-@ style slaying of soprano family associate , brendan filone .
was it part of a power struggle ?
interesting .
no one would have ranked him as associate !
-a loyal soldier , and he winds up dead ....
soldier ?
brendan filone ? associate ? soldier ? fuck you !
jesus !
did you see it from the beginning ? did they mention my name ?
stop the fucking chitchat , all right ? i gotta go .
nobody makes guinso gravy like you , nana .
you know , i &apos;m up at bard waiting for my care package .
i don &apos;t like that word , jason .
what , guinso ?
the word is offensive !
she &apos;s right , jason .
sorry , nana . what &apos;s it mean ?
it &apos;s from guinea .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a derogation .
i have a patient . you wouldn &apos;t say guinea to him .
italian male seeing a shrink . let me guess : mother issues .
why wouldn &apos;t you ?
just wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;d be scared ? is he in the mafia ?
no , i shouldn &apos;t have mentioned it ! can we change the subject ?
no way . mom , is he in the mob , or what ?
he &apos;s not a mobster , is he ?
nobody knows better than you , richard . i can &apos;t discuss my patients .
i just hope he &apos;s not one of those crumbs on the news .
just refer him to another doctor . you can do that , couldn &apos;t you ?
grate the cheese , dad .
sure she can .
that might be what you would do , richard .
now i remember why we got divorced .
why refer him to another doctor ? he &apos;s my patient .
you can &apos;t treat sociopaths .
you shouldn &apos;t help scum with bed @-@ wetting .
you have no idea who this man is , and yet you call him scum .
people like him are the reason italian @-@ americans have a bad image .
i agree .
ask any american to describe an italian @-@ american in this country ...
... invariably he &apos;s gonna reference the godfather , goodfellas ...
good movies .
... and the rest will mention pizza .
good movies to eat pizza by .
stop it , jason ! i never said he was in the mafia .
we &apos;ll never see an italian president .
and that &apos;s my patient &apos;s fault ?
i realize that you &apos;re involved in the anti @-@ defamation lobby .
so go after hollywood if you feel you must . but leave my patient alone .
it &apos;s a synergy .
news items and the portrayal of italian @-@ americans as gangsters !
wasn &apos;t the italian anti @-@ def deal started by joe colombo ? a mobster ?
italians against discrimination did a study .
in its height , the mafia in the u.s. had less than 5000 members .
and yet , that tiny , insignificant fraction ...
... casts such a dark shadow over 20 million hard @-@ working americans .
at this point in our cultural history , mob movies are classic american cinema .
like westerns .
i have to agree there , rich .
you never saw the scotch @-@ irish pissing and moaning ...
... about being portrayed as rustlers and gunslingers .
that &apos;s absurd !
see what you started with your gravy , nana ?
to we , the 20 million .
salute !
salute !
cent &apos;anni .
salute .
what ?
come here . we &apos;re exterminating .
i &apos;m busy now .
get some sfogliatelle for the guys .
yeah .
twenty @-@ nine .
here you go , big guy .
hey , gino . what can i get you ?
get me some--
number 34 , right here !
he just went out to get gas in his car .
i go out , fuck your sister ,
come back saturday , i go to the front ?
i said he could .
poppin &apos; fresh , i &apos;m in no mood !
i &apos;m next , now get a fucking pastry box .
gino , what can i get you ?
dougie , let him go first .
he don &apos;t make the rules here !
all right , two neapolitan loaves--
you touch a single crust , you &apos;ll wish you took that job at mcdonalds !
fuck you !
okay , take a walk .
what about my bread ?
you come back in 10 minutes .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
come on .
get up , i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
what is it ? do i look like a pussy to you ?
no .
seriously , be honest , i won &apos;t get mad .
so why give me a hard time and talk to me like i &apos;m nothing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
get a pastry box .
move it !
that &apos;s better .
now fill it with cannoli , sfogliatelle and napoleons .
move .
good .
give me the box . come on .
next time you see my face , show some respect .
i will .
you motherfucker !
you shot my foot !
it happens .
you fucking asshole !
if i &apos;m getting an invitation to the dance , i wish the feds would hurry up .
you heard what the news said .
the way things are working , it &apos;s junior &apos;s party .
that was a far @-@ thinking plan you had there , tone .
i called you last christmas .
fuck this !
the sfogliatelle ! what &apos;s wrong with you ?
what are you doing ? you brought up in a barn , or what ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
this is no time to go on the rag . not with the indictment coming down .
take georgie , go in the bathroom , sweep for bugs .
come on .
well , i hope they &apos;ll be all right .
who ?
the guys .
what about me ?
they didn &apos;t even mention your name on tv .
amazing , huh ? that news guy , he said the words &quot; brendan filone ... &quot;
... the hairs on the back of my neck , they fucking stood up .
i knew the guy .
they made him look like john @-@ fucking @-@ gotti .
i brought him around here .
tony wouldn &apos;t have never known him if it wasn &apos;t for me .
i had no idea .
who is it ? i &apos;m sleeping .
carmela .
oh , come on in .
i just said that in case you were ...
... that snooty @-@ assed mrs. ryan down the hall .
she is so shanty irish , and with all her airs .
come on , i &apos;m taking you to brunch .
what ?
get dressed .
what &apos;s wrong ? tell me .
why does something have to be wrong ?
meadow ? she eats like a bird .
everything is fine , ma , relax ! nothing is wrong .
you come here unannounced . i shouldn &apos;t wonder if something &apos;s wrong ?
jeez , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s a nice day , i thought i would take you out .
i don &apos;t want to go out !
is it anthony ? those indictments ?
his father could take it in stride , but he can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t believe you .
ma , will you get dressed ?
we just went to a wedding !
that was a big to @-@ do .
this way we get to spend some quality time .
the manor will stop serving brunch any minute .
did he cheat on you again ?
i try to do something nice . i come here to take you out .
you think i have some other agenda that i have to talk to you about ?
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
i &apos;ll .... i &apos;ll throw something on .
buckle your seat belt , ma .
i can &apos;t find it ! where is it ?
it &apos;s not definite . i just thought i &apos;d tell you .
in case i don &apos;t show up for an appointment .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re planning a vacation , but you &apos;re not sure when ?
right .
i may never go .
let &apos;s put it this way :
there &apos;s a strong possibility that it could happen .
does this have anything to do with what &apos;s been on the news lately ?
if you suddenly stop coming to your appointments ...
... i will assume that you are on vacation ?
and i should wait to be contacted ?
that would be a good assumption .
who is it ?
paulie . open the door .
i thought we were stepping out .
i got two broads in the car .
you said ade went to stay at her mother &apos;s .
no wonder . the place looks like a fucking sty .
what &apos;s wrong ?
talk to me . this ain &apos;t like you , kid .
i ran into billy cracciolo .
the meter maid ? what about him ?
told me the cops in nutley are looking for a guy .
blew off a kid &apos;s toe for no good reason in russo &apos;s bakery .
drove a lexus ?
does tony know about this ?
what &apos;s going on , chrissy ?
been working my ass off on this script . you know how many pages i got ?
nineteen .
that a lot or a little ?
books say a movie &apos;s supposed to be about 120 pages .
i thought the computer would do a lot of it .
you &apos;re being frank about the business--
i would never do that . it &apos;s only &quot; suggested by . &quot;
that writer , with the bullfights ? blew his own fucking head off .
i bought a scriptwriting program .
my advice ? put that thing down a while .
we get our joints copped .
tomorrow , the words will come blowing out your ass .
you ever feel like nothing good would ever happen ?
yeah . and nothing did . so what ?
i &apos;m alive , i &apos;m surviving .
that &apos;s it . i don &apos;t want to just survive .
it says in movie @-@ writing books that every character has an arc , understand ?
everybody starts out somewheres , and then they do something ...
... it changes their life . that &apos;s their arc .
where &apos;s my arc ?
all right , take richard kimble , right ?
no , that &apos;s no good . his arc is run , run , jump off the dam ....
keanu reeves , devil &apos;s advocate .
al . -right .
keanu &apos;s a lawyer , gets all turned on by money , power and the devil .
then his wife says , &quot; you &apos;re not the man i married , &quot; leaves him .
you see the arc ?
he starts down here , he ends up here .
where &apos;s my arc , paulie ?
kid ...
... richard kimble , the devil &apos;s whatever , those are all make @-@ believe .
i got no arc either .
i was born , grew up , spent a few years in the army , a few more in the can .
and here i am . a half a wiseguy . so what ?
i got no identity .
even brendan filone &apos;s got an identity . he &apos;s dead .
i killed that fucking emil kolar , and nothing .
i don &apos;t even move up a notch .
all i got is nightmares .
that polish , czech , whatever he is ...
... is haunting me in my dreams every night .
that happens . the more of them you do , the better you &apos;ll sleep .
i had one prick for months in my dreams .
i feel like he &apos;s trying to tell me we fucked up the night we buried him .
we didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m in danger .
can i ask a question ?
why would he tell you you &apos;re in danger ...
... considering you put a moonroof in his head ?
what did we do wrong that night ?
the gun was hot , so the slugs couldn &apos;t be traced to me .
you know who had an ark ? noah .
is that him ?
that would be some coincidence ...
... if it wasn &apos;t , wouldn &apos;t it ?
holy shit ! look .
what ?
he was clean @-@ shaven . he &apos;s got a beard now .
you know what ? i read that . that happens .
i always thought it was bullshit .
look at his fingernails !
they &apos;re like a woman &apos;s .
i &apos;m gonna fucking puke .
help me lift him and take him to pine barrens before they build a condo here .
georgie !
i don &apos;t know about selling this property .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i sure could use an infusion ...
... if we &apos;re supporting jase after he graduates .
it &apos;s funny how even during our marriage , we saw things differently .
i never saw this place as an investment .
i always thought that we &apos;d build a house .
so are we gonna sell , or what ?
for jason .
i don &apos;t want to hear that you took one of your colleens on a cruise .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean , &quot; colleens &quot; ?
we all know you &apos;re a sucker for those irish girls .
every italian boy bows down to the freckles .
i married you !
yeah , i was a mother figure .
don &apos;t bust my balls with freud @-@ by @-@ numbers .
don &apos;t bust my balls ? richard , your calabrese is showing .
are you implying by all this i &apos;m ashamed to be an italian @-@ american ?
with all the poverty , starvation , ethnic cleansing ...
... and horrible shit in this world ...
... you devote your energy to protecting the dignity of connie francis !
you &apos;re worked up about my patient ...
... a man who has no bearing on who or where you are in this world .
call him a patient . the man &apos;s a criminal , jennifer .
and after a while , you &apos;re gonna get beyond psychotherapy ...
... with its cheesy moral relativism .
finally , you &apos;re gonna get to good and evil . and he &apos;s evil .
sorry i &apos;m late . the alarm--
what is wrong with you ?
i ain &apos;t been feeling good .
i wipe my ass with your feelings .
thanks .
drive the fucking car !
we &apos;re under a microscope . i hear you shot some kid ...
... because he made you wait !
fucking paulie !
don &apos;t blame paulie !
nutley pd &apos;s got a description and a make on the car !
why don &apos;t you leave a urine sample ?
if i could--
shut up !
georgie comes in with vomit all over . i ask , &quot; what the fuck ? &quot;
he said you &apos;re digging up some body !
i was worried--
shut up !
you want to get caught .
i want to ?
yeah . i seen it before . that &apos;s fucking cowboy @-@ itis .
you want to be a bad guy ?
i was worried that i didn &apos;t--
shut up !
can i try and explain here ?
i don &apos;t know , tony .
it &apos;s like the regular @-@ ness of life is too fucking hard for me .
i don &apos;t know .
look at you .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re sleeping all the time .
it &apos;s the only thing i still enjoy .
you know what i think ?
maybe i have cancer .
remember how jackie got ?
cancer ?
something fucking horrible is going on inside my body .
does this word &quot; cancer &quot; pop into your mind a lot ...
... a little bit , what ?
well , i &apos;m just thinking , maybe you &apos;re ...
... depressed .
me ?
i &apos;m no fucking mental midget .
right .
watch the--
what ?
filter .
oh , fuck !
maybe you got ...
... a serotonin problem , or whatever the fuck they call it .
you know about that shit ?
i saw it last night on a program .
what , take fucking prozac ? not this skinny guinea .
let me ask a question .
you ever think about ...
... you know ....
fuck no !
good .
bunch of losers blowing their skulls all over the bathroom ?
it &apos;s fucking pathetic .
did you hear the doorbell ?
i &apos;m in the middle of a game .
you &apos;ll be in the middle of the street , you don &apos;t wise up .
anthony soprano ?
why are you in my yard ?
the gate was open .
i &apos;m agent harris , this is agent driscol . may we come in ?
if i say no ?
if we were local , we wouldn &apos;t knock .
what &apos;s your point ?
we have a search warrant . we know you have children .
our other team &apos;s out front .
we don &apos;t traumatize kids by kicking in doors .
so why don &apos;t you take a minute and tell them you have visitors .
any quarters , you can keep .
you trying to bribe me ?
tell me what you &apos;re looking for , i can save you time .
any incriminating evidence would be nice .
dad !
i have an english paper !
you gotta be shitting me .
i better have all my programs when it comes back .
anthony !
what the hell are they doing in my kitchen ?
what are you doing ?
forgot your lunch , just ask .
i &apos;m very sorry .
how much would you say that bowl cost ?
i &apos;m not cleaning that up .
grasso , clean that .
grasso , ti faccio un culo cosi .
your ass !
tony , take it easy . grasso , take it easy .
we &apos;ll be gone in a few minutes .
let &apos;s wait in the living room .
clean up the bowl .
come on .
i know they &apos;re doing their job , but i &apos;m pissed .
harris wasn &apos;t so bad .
he was the biggest sneak out of all of them . it &apos;s part of his act .
that guy broke the bowl on purpose .
he was just a klutz .
what was his last name ?
rizzo , razzo , what ?
grasso .
grasso . you think it &apos;s a coincidence they sent him ?
if he wasn &apos;t italian , he &apos;d be at the office sweeping up . jerk .
bet they frisk him before he goes home .
why ?
why ?
because he has a vowel at the end of his name : grasso .
does he think he &apos;ll make it to the top by arresting his own people ?
pass the moo shu .
he &apos;ll see . he &apos;ll learn .
we have a vowel .
and you be proud of it !
you &apos;d think there was no michelangelo , the way they treat people .
an italian invented the telephone .
alexander graham bell was italian ?
you see ? you see what-- ?
antonio meucci invented it , and he got robbed !
everybody knows that !
who invented the mafia ?
what ?
la cosa nostra . who invented that ?
who cares ?
wasn &apos;t it salvatore lucania , known as charlie &quot; lucky &quot; luciano ...
... who organized the five families : lucchese , gambino , bonanno , profaci .
is there something you want to say to me ?
i just like history , like you , dad .
can you shut the fuck up about it ?
a.j. , did you know john cabot was italian ?
whoa .
like he knows who that is .
the famous discoverer of canada .
the bank of america .
one of the biggest banks in the world , started by an italian .
the first american saint was italian . mother cabrini .
is it true the chinese invented spaghetti ?
now think . why would people who eat with sticks ...
... invent something you need a fork to eat ?
here &apos;s more i bet you don &apos;t know .
more italians fought for the u.s. in wwii than any other ethnic group .
they won &apos;t tell you about sacco and vanzetti .
the anti @-@ christs that got the electric chair ?
anarchists .
isn &apos;t it anti @-@ christs ?
they were innocent and got the chair because they were italian .
how are there two anti @-@ christs and only one christ ?
so ?
and of course , francis albert .
will i see you next week ?
if you know something i don &apos;t .
you understand , i have to charge you for the missed session .
what do you mean ?
we agreed on that on our first meeting .
but i just explained my situation .
i understand , but it &apos;s important that we respect the agreement .
what if i got hit by a car ?
but you weren &apos;t .
i know , but what if ?
but you weren &apos;t .
i know that , but what if ?
you weren &apos;t .

i don &apos;t understand that , and i don &apos;t appreciate being made to feel afraid .
i don &apos;t appreciate feeling like i pour my heart out to a call girl !
is that how you see me ?
not until now .
but it &apos;s obvious you don &apos;t give a shit about my situation .
otherwise , you wouldn &apos;t shake me down .
it &apos;ll show as paid on your next bill .
fine .
stick it up your ass .
and how about dr. goldman here ?
he was gonna be a tree surgeon , but he fainted at the sight of sap !
sap , ladies and gentlemen .

movie night , right ? last week they showed the polish version of rashomon .
everybody remembers the rape exactly the same !
what &apos;s the matter with you , corrado ?
headaches , that &apos;s all . not the kind you take aspirin for .

... and a woman from france will pull light bulbs from her husband &apos;s throat .
this woman can relate .
we may have a bad apple .
does tony know about this ?
what will you do ?
there &apos;s not much to do . we sit back and wait .
don &apos;t let tony know you know . he &apos;s under enough pressure .
yeah .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s telling his psychiatrist it &apos;s all his mother &apos;s fault .
what , a psychiatrist ?
yeah , a psychiatrist .
he &apos;s been seeing one for a while now .
god only knows what he says .
tony ?

jason , are you concerned that your mother is treating this patient x ?
i don &apos;t care .
as a colleague , jen , i suggest you drop the patient .
after her last encounter ...
... she finally acknowledged ...
... that she saw the different side of him , the subhuman .
i take it you were frightened .
frightened , revolted .
at last , appropriate emotions .
oh , for chrissake , richard . you too , sam .
when did we become afraid to get our hands dirty ?
it &apos;s what she gets paid for .
jason , how would you like to see your mother ... ?
never mind , i &apos;m not gonna paint any graphic images .
see ? he always does that .
what ?
follow that up , jase . dad does what ?
his issue is that i should distance myself from this man ...
... on the grounds of the stigma that he brings us .
i say refer this patient to a therapist ...
... that specializes in mafia depression .
this isn &apos;t funny .
no , of course not .
jen has a real honest to goodness personal and professional dilemma .
you know , on my mother &apos;s side , we have a few dark sheep .
