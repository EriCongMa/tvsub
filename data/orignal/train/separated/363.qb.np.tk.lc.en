mom ! open the door , please .
mom , open the door !
please don &apos;t , mom ! please don &apos;t !
please don &apos;t . please !
open the door ! please !
please don &apos;t , mom !
mom ? open the door .
mom !
open it !
mom , please .
mom ...
come on .
come on , bobby !
let &apos;s go .
let me stay with you .
oh , don &apos;t cry , sweetheart .
come on , please ?
i don &apos;t want to do this again .
i know , and i &apos;m so , so , so sorry .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
it &apos;s ok .
go on .
what are you doing here ?
thank you .
i am really sorry . i had to take that .
it &apos;s ok .
fruit plate , huh ?
whatever happened to the usual bacon and eggs ,
extra grease on the side ?
well , i &apos;ve changed .
ok , the cantaloupe is for your benefit .
when we were married ,
you were always warning me about clogged arteries .
and you would always say to me ...
nobody lives forever .
so how &apos;s san francisco ?
well , you know .
fog , cable cars , the usual .
you know , i &apos;m really glad you called me .
it would be nice if we saw each other
more than once every 3 or 4 years .
maybe we can .
so , give me the updates .
anybody serious in your life ?
well , there are all those serial killers . they &apos;re pretty serious .
i meant in your personal life .
no , there isn &apos;t .
how about you ?
you know , david ...
i &apos;ve been wanting--
damn it , i--
you gotta go .
i know .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s comforting to know
that some things never change .
look , how much longer are you gonna be in town ?
about a week or so , probably .
why don &apos;t you come over to my place for dinner
before you head back ?
i still make a monster cioppino .
i would like that very much .
great .
ciao .
ciao .
hey , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
i got hung up with something .
what do we got ?
a child abduction in st. louis .
yeah . bobby smith , 9 years old ,
vanished 48 hours ago from a residential area ,
where his mother , marlene smith ,
claims to have dropped him off .
48 hours and we &apos;re just learning about it now ?
yeah . that &apos;s &apos; cause mom didn &apos;t know her son was gone .
she assumed that he was with the grandmother
and just left him there .
so , she &apos;s not exactly on the short list for mother of the year .
what about the father ?
uh , he was convicted of
embezzling from his workplace 2 years ago .
currently cooling his heels in state prison .
if it &apos;s a stranger abduction , the first 24 hours are critical .
this kid &apos;s already been missing twice that long .
which is why we shouldn &apos;t waste any more time . let &apos;s go .
i brought you something to eat , bobby .
gotta go to work now .
when can i see my mom ?
i already told you .
we &apos;ll talk about your mom later .
no ! don &apos;t go !
&quot; from childhood &apos;s hour i have not been as others were ,
i have not seen as others saw . &quot;
edgar allan poe .
st. louis .
oh , probably a couple days .
i &apos;ll let you know .
can &apos;t wait .
bye .
what ?
nothing . just somebody &apos;s got a lot of extra pep
in their step this morning , that &apos;s all .
probably doubled up on his vitamins .
oh , he doubled up on something .
garcia , what have you got on the mother ?
oh , i have so much on the mother ,
and try as i might , none of it is good .
marlene smith has a history of erratic behavior ,
seriously clinically depressed ,
two suicide attempts in the last 5 years .
was she being treated for her depression ?
oh , my gosh , yes .
like more pill @-@ popping than elvis . yes .
depression is one of the few things
that can overwhelm the maternal instinct .
what about the grandmother ?
i don &apos;t have anything on her yet ,
but don &apos;t reach for your remote .
i &apos;ll be ba @-@ a @-@ ck .
two suicide attempts .
why hasn &apos;t child services intervened ?
probably talked her way out of it .
most social service organizations
are overworked and underfunded . things slip through the cracks .
if this boy &apos;s mother tried to commit suicide
and he &apos;s from a chronically unhappy household .
maybe this wasn &apos;t an abduction at all .
what if boy simply ran away ?
when 9 @-@ year @-@ olds run away ,
they &apos;re usually home for supper .
jj , you and i will talk to the mother .
morgan and reid , go to the boy &apos;s house .
prentiss , you and dave assess the site
where the mother claims to have dropped him off .
detective woods . glad to have you here .
this is agent jareau .
agent .
how &apos;s the mother doing ?
she &apos;s a wreck .
can &apos;t get much from her till she calms down .
i think you should talk to her alone .
ok .
i &apos;ll leave you to it .
i &apos;ll watch from here .
mrs. smith ?
i &apos;m agent jareau .
jennifer .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
did you hear any more about my bobby ?
no , ma &apos;am .
but our entire team is here
and we &apos;re the best at what we do .
we &apos;re gonna need your help , ok ?
ok .
i have a boy of my own .
he &apos;s almost 3 .
i can &apos;t even imagine what you are going through .
he &apos;s so little .
i know .
can you tell me what happened
the morning you dropped him off ?
i was having one of my bad days .
and what does one of your bad days look like ?
i wanted to hurt myself .
i can &apos;t control it .
is that why you took him to his grandmother ?
yeah . see , i have to protect him .
and you had done this in the past ?
yeah .
i just had to get him out of the house .
you know ? i just had to get him out of the house .
it &apos;s all i kept thinking about was just get him out .
get him out !
cheerful .
depression is a vicious cycle .
it frequently manifests itself in the degradation
of one &apos;s personal living environment ,
which in turn fuels the depression ,
which then worsens the living environment .
all right , i &apos;ll take a look around in here .
why don &apos;t you check out the kitchen ?
ah , the kitchen .
is that a problem ?
frankly , i &apos;m not too anxious to see
the perishable food version of this room .
so when i was feeling better ,
i went to my mother &apos;s to pick him up ,
and ... that &apos;s when they told me he wasn &apos;t there .
you didn &apos;t call ahead before you dropped him off ?
yeah . she didn &apos;t answer .
she didn &apos;t have an answering machine ?
yeah , she has , but there wasn &apos;t time for that .
please help me understand , mrs. smith .
it takes 10 seconds to leave a message .
look , these bad days you have i understand .
there--there must be times when--
look !
bobby saw me do this before .
twice .
i had to get him out of the house .
don &apos;t you understand ?
ok .
four pair of shoes .
why exactly is that relevant ?
come on , reid , how many women you know
only have 4 pairs of shoes in their closet ?
my experience in and around women &apos;s closets
isn &apos;t exactly extensive enough to really formulate an opinion .
the answer is none . you can take my word for it .
she even set up a separate area so he could do his homework .
mom has serious financial issues ,
denies herself even the smallest luxury ,
and yet ...
splurges to take her son to an expensive theme park
and then buys a pricey picture frame
so he can remember the experience .
hey , buddy .
after work i stopped and got you something .
120 colors .
the biggest box they had .
i want to go home now .
i need to ask you something , bobby .
your mother , she isn &apos;t happy a lot .
would you like it if her pain could stop ?
&apos;cause i can make that happen .
do you want me to help your mom ?
that &apos;s good , bobby .
that means you &apos;re strong ,
like me .
you made the right decision .
wait , where are you going ?
to help your mom .
why don &apos;t you draw a picture while i &apos;m gone .
mother &apos;s not a suspect anymore ?
based on our assessment , we need to reprioritize .
the concern for her son was genuine .
her tone of voice , body language .
she didn &apos;t once ask if she was in trouble ,
under arrest , where &apos;s my lawyer ? none of that .
home environment points the same direction .
the money &apos;s tight , but mom did whatever she could
to create a nice world for her son .
whatever cash she had she spent on him .
only 4 pairs of shoes in her closet .
and she taught her son to be self @-@ sufficient .
the kitchen was scaled down to a 9 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s level
so he could microwave his own meals ,
get food and utensils from the pantry .
he even had his own little
key ring so he could come and go as he pleased .
how &apos;d it go .
it took a while ,
but grandma &apos;s alibi checked out .
she was with two lady friends in seneca ,
other side of the state .
acquaintances , relatives , teachers .
so far they &apos;ve all checked out .
this is starting to look more and more like a stranger abduction .
yeah , except the area bobby disappeared from
has a decent amount of foot traffic .
if he &apos;d put up a struggle ,
chances are someone would have noticed .
my guess is bobby knew his abductor
or trusted him .
the trip to grandma &apos;s house was a spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment decision .
the unsub must have been staking out
the mother &apos;s house , saw them leaving , and followed .
self @-@ sufficient kids learn to trust their own judgment .
how did the unsub get into bobby &apos;s life ?
and what &apos;s he trying to accomplish ?
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
mrs. smith ?
i know where your son is .
what ?
where ?
i can take you to him .
there &apos;s something strange about the body .
she was slaughtered by someone completely out of control ,
yet on her wrists there are precise wounds
on top of where she already cut herself , only deeper .
like he was trying to replicate
her suicide attempts but then lost control .
maybe this was never about the kid at all , but about the mother .
make her suffer for a few
days by taking the child , then kill her ?
it means he knew her personal history .
i &apos;ll call garcia .
hey , baby girl , whatever you &apos;re doing , drop it .
oh , yes , and with pleasure .
let me tell you something , sweetheart .
this is a lamborghini you are talking to . you have to drive me .
you can &apos;t just leave me parked in the garage
collecting dust or i will wilt .
please forgive my neglect .
i need you to rev up that
fine @-@ tuned italian engine of yours , then .
revving .
our unsub had personal details about marlene smith ,
so i need you to figure out
who might have been in her house recently .
cable guy , plumber , people like that .
yeah , i always wonder about plumbers .
you know they peek in your medicine cabinet . you just know it .
maybe try a phone repairman or a babysitter .
check computers in the house .
maybe she used of of those
techie fix @-@ it type dweebs who makes house calls .
hey , watch it . language .
you know i &apos;m just playing with you ,
but come on , put a rush on it . clock &apos;s ticking , ok ?
rush is the only speed a lamborghini has .
proud techie dweeb over and out . beep beep ya .
agent hotchner .
we had another child abduction .
a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy taken from a park about a half an hour ago .
just a couple miles from here .
morgan and reid , head over there .
i was sitting on the bench ,
and he was playing right there .
i looked away for two seconds .
were you by yourself ?
you told the police you live in mckinley heights .
that &apos;s almost an hour away .
you drove your son all the way out here to play ?
i was doing things .
shopping .
why are they looking here ?
my son isn &apos;t here .
mrs. tanner , please don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but exactly what drug are you addicted to ?
you &apos;re displaying symptoms of withdrawal .
are you crazy ?
ma &apos;am , we saw two deals going down on the other side of the park
when we arrived . you were here to buy , weren &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s what had you distracted .
i can &apos;t believe that you actually think i would--
your child is missing , ms. tanner .
every minute , every half @-@ minute counts .
you need to tell us the truth and you need to tell us now .
this will be your bed up here , timmy .
bunk beds are cool . this &apos;ll be the boys only room .
look , i got you some new pajamas .
i want my mommy !
i want my mommy !
fine !
i want my mommy !
you want to be a baby ?
you sit there and cry like a baby for your mommy !
i want my mommy .
mommy !
yeah , hotch , the mother &apos;s addicted to oxy .
she was out here to buy .
all right , let &apos;s put her in protective custody .
so we got one mom suicidal and the other one addicted to drugs .
at least we got a pattern developing .
and if the unsub holds to pattern ,
he &apos;s gonna circle back and try to kill her .
i want my mommy !
i shouldn &apos;t have gotten mad in there like that with timmy .
let me out !
that was wrong .
but he &apos;s got a mommy like yours .
weak .
help ! mommy !
when can i go home ?
this is your home now .
you &apos;ll be safe and happy here .
i want my mommy !
where is my mom ?
i took your mom to a place where she &apos;ll be happier .
that &apos;s what you said you wanted .
no .
do you think wolves are bad ?
people say they are , but they &apos;re not .
they kill other animals for a reason--
to get rid of the sick and the weak .
let me out !
thin the herd .
i want my mommy !
so the herd can be stronger .
it &apos;s the way of nature .
and they--they even kill other wolves sometimes ,
when they &apos;re weak or sick .
but the nice thing is ,
wolves always take care of any cubs
who don &apos;t have moms or dads .
let me out !
help !
when i was bringing timothy over ,
i asked him the same thing i asked you .
did he want me to make things better with his mommy ?
and he said yes .
as little as he is ,
he said yes .
i want my mommy !
it &apos;s an instinct .
he knows .
here &apos;s a snack for you guys .
i just gotta go out
for a little while .
we &apos;re looking for a male unsub
in his mid to late 20s ,
physically fit enough to subdue marlene smith
and carry out a vicious and sustained attack .
we believe he sees himself as a rescuer ,
taking children away from unfit parents .
he may very well have abandonment issues from his own childhood .
the impulsive nature of committing the murder out in the open
suggests that he &apos;s inexperienced .
the violence on marlene smith went from precision to frenzy ,
which points to someone with classic psychopathic traits ,
quick to rage and quick to recover .
he also appears to have insider knowledge
of the families in these cases ,
so we need to look for someone who is privy
to what went on behind those closed doors .
emergency personnel were called to the smith house
after both suicide attempts and once to the tanner house
after the mother overdosed on prescription drugs .
that means first responders ,
child service workers , ambulance personnel .
both missing children
apparently went without struggle or protest .
that makes us think that they had prior contact
with the person we &apos;re looking for .
or they inherently trust who he is by virtue of his job ,
the uniform he wears-- doctor , mailman , policeman .
so far the violence has been directed to the offending parent ,
but we don &apos;t know what the unsub &apos;s end game is .
we have written up a media release
on precautions the public needs to take .
and we &apos;ve taken the second mother into protective custody ,
mommy !
thus depriving him of his target .
this will increase his volatility .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s critical we find these kids .
if they are alive , he may turn his violence
against the children themselves .
i want my mommy !
i want to go home !
i want my mommy !
i want my mommy !
don &apos;t hurt him !
thank god you found him .
we got lucky .
whoever took him let him go .
is he ok ?
your son was checked out by a pediatrician .
there was no sexual or physical abuse .
i can &apos;t believe my wife let this happen .
i need a drink .
did you see another little boy there ?
his name was bobby .
is he ok ?
good .
were you in a dark place or did it have windows ?
it was a house .
ok .
so when he took you ,
did you drive in the car for a long time
or a short time ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you tell us what the man looked like ?
i don &apos;t know .
timothy .
when this man came to the park to get you ,
were you afraid ?
no .
why not ?
he said he would come ,
on the phone .
the phone . you talked to him on the telephone ?
he &apos;s a superhero .
can you show us ?
911 operator . please state your emergency .
911 operator . state your emergency .
you &apos;ve gotta send somebody .
he tried to attack me .
who did ?
my mom &apos;s boyfriend .
what &apos;s your name ?
shannon .
shannon barton .
how old are you ?
13 . please ,
please send somebody .
he &apos;s drunk and my mom won &apos;t do anything about it .
are you still at 788.4th avenue , apartment c ?
yes . hurry .
help is on the way , shannon .
garcia , any progress with the 911 dispatcher ?
i &apos;m going as fast as i can , which is super fast .
there are literally hundreds in the great st . louis area .
can you help me narrow this down ?
refine your search to males between 25 and 30 years of age .
and our unsub probably has abandonment issues ,
so look for backgrounds that reflect that .
a history of foster care
or someone who was farmed out to other relatives
by his own parents .
can you trace individual 911 dispatchers
based on calls they would have received ?
ok , look , let me make this clear .
there are a quarter of a billion 911 calls anually ,
that &apos;s like 10 calls every second of every day .
and non @-@ emergent calls are disposed of quickly .
well , this operator would
have been on duty when both calls came in
from the smith and tanner families .
and he would have been
off duty at the times of the two abductions
and marlene smith &apos;s murder .
oh , my god . this brings needle
in a haystack to a whole other dimension ,
but i will go to that dimension
and i will cross @-@ reference and i will call you back .
a mother who wants to kill herself .
what does that say to a child ?
that you &apos;re not worth sticking around for ?
a 911 operator
would be why the kids trusted him .
the unsub must have gone back to the house
to do some sort of follow @-@ up on his own
and they remembered his face .
rossi ?
did you hear me ?
oh . sorry .
uh ... morgan and i were joking around on the jet ,
but something is definitely up .
is there anything you want to share ?
it &apos;s nothing that ...
i had breakfast with carolyn the other morning .
carolyn .
oh ! is that wife number 4 or 5 ?
look , let &apos;s get our facts straight .
i only had 3 wives .
i mean , that &apos;s within the realm of reasonable .
ok . i &apos;m sorry .
which one was carolyn ?
numero uno .
use your words , emily .
uh ... there &apos;s always something about the first ,
in anything .
i don &apos;t know , i might be way off here ,
but i think she &apos;s putting some feelers out
to see if that old spark is still there .
is it ?
i &apos;m having her over to my house for dinner when i get back .
i &apos;m crazy , right ?
we don &apos;t always get second chances in life , rossi .
i say take the plunge ,
see where it goes .
come with me , sir .
don &apos;t take him , don &apos;t take him . he didn &apos;t do anything .
he said he didn &apos;t do anything .
she--she makes stuff up . shannon , tell them you made a mistake .
uh , i &apos;ll take my own car .
come on , let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t touch me .
why did you call the police ?
he said he didn &apos;t do anything .
he came into my bedroom and grabbed me .
honey , he was in there for another reason .
he has me . why--
i hate you !
shannon .
talk to me , mama .
first off , you are on restriction from my inner lamborghini .
garcia--
i mean it . this high @-@ performance engine
may purr like a puma on the prowl ,
but this time , derek , you have seriously overheated my engines
and i will require some cool @-@ down laps upon your return ,
if you know what i mean by that .
baby girl , you &apos;re on speaker .
i knew that .
i &apos;m calling to tell you , sir ,
there are 11.911 dispatchers
in the greater st . louis area that were on duty
when the calls were placed
but not working during the murder and abduction .
of those 11 , there &apos;s one that fits your profile--
george kelling , age 27 , 1181 clay street ,
apartment 8 . sending his picture right now .
do you know where he is now ?
he was scheduled to work today . his supervisor said
he showed up for his shift , but then he left early .
can you get the log of all the calls he took tonight ?
yeah , of course . but there are a lot .
skip to the last one .
last one is a domestic disturbance
at 788.4th avenue , number c.
attempted sexual assault of a young girl .
kelling dispatched the police and then he took off .
let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t walk away from me when i &apos;m talking to you .
you &apos;re not my boss . you know what ?
just go be with your boyfriend .
the police said you had to come to the station ,
so go get your stuff so we can go . now !
what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to do some follow @-@ up , make sure everything &apos;s ok .
everything &apos;s fine . we just need to be left alone right now .
everything &apos;s not fine , mrs . barton .
mom !
oh , my god .
clear !
it &apos;s clear .
the door &apos;s open and the lights are on .
the unsub beat us here . what have you got ?
nothing . the place is empty .
if the unsub &apos;s keeping the kids ,
he &apos;s holding them someplace else .
you need to get away .
i know you .
you &apos;re the kid on the news that was kidnapped .
who hurt you ?
who is he ? what does he want ?
i know this is a lot to absorb right now .
where &apos;s my mom ?
i &apos;m helping you .
you called for help .
the police already came . they took him away .
shannon , the problem isn &apos;t the boyfriend .
there &apos;ll be another boyfriend after him
and another after that .
the problem is your mother .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , you said to check backgrounds .
at 10 years of age , george kelling entered the foster care system
and i don &apos;t know why .
his father abandoned the family when he was a baby .
i can &apos;t figure out what happened to mom yet .
all right , we need the address
of the foster family he was placed with .
yeah , yeah , i know . he bounced around a lot .
give me a second . i &apos;ll call you back .
ok .
ok , what i don &apos;t understand
is why would he keep bobby but release timothy ?
if he wants to get rid of the parent , why not kill them first
and then take the child . it &apos;s so much riskier to wait .
unless the children are a crucial part of his killing ritual .
how ?
he needs something from them before he can murder the parents .
what could they possibly give him ?
their approval .
that &apos;s what he wants her to say .
my daughter will never tell him to get rid of me .
never .
we fight sometimes , but we love each other .
she &apos;s my whole world . she means so much to me .
he &apos;ll hurt her if she doesn &apos;t ,
because that means she &apos;s weak , too .
deja vu all over again .
so , get this .
george kelling &apos;s mom committed suicide
when he was 10 . she jumped off a bridge .
before that , the attempted to kill herself multiple times ,
cutting her wrists . this sounds really familiar , huh ?
did you find the foster home address ?
those records are still sealed .
i got my crowbar out , i &apos;m working on it .
you &apos;re crazy .
i &apos;m going to tell you something
i &apos;ve never told anyone before , shannon .
nobody .
my mother ,
she was troubled , too .
she either stayed in bed crying
or she went on long walks .
i never knew where she went on those walks .
then one day i decided to follow her .
she didn &apos;t know i was there .
at first it just ... seemed like she was wandering .
but then i saw where she was going .
it was a bridge .
she climbed up onto the ledge
and sat there looking down .
it seemed like she was there for hours .
my mother , she wanted to die .
but it was like--
was like she couldn &apos;t make herself do it .
and then it happened .
she was gone .
for that moment ,
i don &apos;t think i ever saw her more content .
it was like a kind of peacefulness .
finally ,
she was free .
as bad as it seemed ,
my mother was right to kill herself .
from one moment to the next ...
her pain ended ...
and my life changed .
now ...
now it &apos;s your moment , shannon .
the foster family lived on a farm
10 miles northwest of the city on parkhill road .
the rest of the team is gonna meet us there .
hurry .
no , no . i didn &apos;t mean it !
don &apos;t hurt him . don &apos;t hurt him !
let go of me !
stop ! it was me !
let me out !
why are you doing this ? what did we do ?
shut up !
just shut up !
so what happened to the foster parents ?
the father died years ago .
the mother just died last month--heart attack .
that must have been the trigger .
the last person who rescued
the unsub was gone . he assumed the mantle .
and now he suddenly has a house to take these kids to .
wait . garcia said the mother jumped off of a bridge , right ?
yeah . why ? what are you thinking ?
suicidology is an imperfect science ,
but it &apos;s uncommon for women to kill themselves so violently .
for lack of a better word ,
they tend to choose more feminine ways to die .
men shoot themselves , jump off of buildings onto pavement .
women are less messy .
they take pills and drown themselves .
and now it &apos;s your turn to do the right thing .
i know you will .
this is about making a decision , shannon .
your mother has caused nothing but pain .
one word from you now and this will all end .
i love my mom .
that &apos;s crap .
what ?
if you loved me ,
you never would have called 911 .
we &apos;re here now because of you .
because you were jealous . jealous that i had a man in my life .
he was gonna rape me .
according to you .
he came into my room ,
he grabbed my blouse
and pushed me onto the bed .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have been dressing like that
in the first place .
it was like you were telling him
that you wanted him to do something .
why are you saying these things ?
you want to know the truth ?
i told gary he could have you .
he was gonna leave me .
you didn &apos;t tell him that .
you couldn &apos;t .
reid and jj and i will take the front .
the rest of you take the perimeter .
it &apos;s time to end this , shannon .
do you agree ?
i think she &apos;s made her decision .
fbi . put the gun down .
drop the gun . do it .
you have to let me finish .
nobody else can do it . nobody &apos;s strong enough .
like you were strong with your mother ?
don &apos;t talk about her .
she was weak . she killed herself and left me alone .
i don &apos;t think so .
because she tried to kill herself before ,
nobody would question it .
