you got your name on the wall .
now i want the respect that comes with it .
meaning ?
i want one of harvey &apos;s clients .
my clients are my clients .
and you don &apos;t get out of my office
in the next three seconds ,
something &apos;s gonna happen between you and me ,
and i guarantee it won &apos;t end with you
keeping all of your teeth .
avery mckernon was the first client
i ever brought into the firm .
they win , like me .
they know trevor isn &apos;t in the class ,
so they know he couldn &apos;t have been the one to steal the test .
i &apos;m not going to expel your friend .
oh , thank you , sir .
there &apos;s just one thing .
i &apos;m gonna call harvard .
believe me when i tell you ,
you &apos;re never going there .
remember this ?
no , you don &apos;t ,
because you can &apos;t remember something you never knew .
you can &apos;t fire me .
why would i fire you when i can break you ?
you see , i &apos;m going to bury you under a mountain of shit so big
you &apos;re going to be begging me to take it off .
first of all , give me that manhattan
and go get yourself a drink a man would order .
come back here in 15 minutes ,
and if i still remember who you are , i &apos;ll be shocked .
okay , so why are we really here ?
i mean , you didn &apos;t just bring me
out to talk about khaleesi .
i did . paul porter says i look like her translator .
he &apos;s a throner ?
though he says i &apos;m a less @-@ attractive version of her translator .
okay , you &apos;re just trying to get me to say
that you &apos;re hotter than her .
am i ?
you &apos;re way hotter .
but she has that accent .
fair point .
you know , look , the reason that i brought you here
is to tell you that i know that you told louis
that i got katrina a job .
look , i -- - relax , i &apos;m not mad at you .
but i do remember you being the person
who told me not to force things
that weren &apos;t meant to be .
rachel ,
just because a person gives advice
doesn &apos;t mean that they have to follow that same advice .
that &apos;s one of the core principles outlined in &quot; the book of donna . &quot;
seriously , though , i didn &apos;t mean to tell louis .
it just came out . i &apos;m sorry .
like i said , it &apos;s fine .
he actually ended up asking if we could be friends again .
and ?
and i told him that things would never be the same between us
unless he forgave mike .
and what did he say ?
he said he couldn &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s easy . the jumper over ehlo .
wrong , the switch @-@ hand layup over perkins and green .
i &apos;m surprised at you , harvey .
the ehlo jumper was a game @-@ winner .
the layup was a statement .
&quot; i can do whatever i want . i own this league . &quot;
are you talking about jordan or yourself now ?
is there a difference ?
a big difference ,
which brings me to why i &apos;m here .
you can &apos;t do whatever you want , harvey .
you want me to make things right with louis .
he made things right between jeff and me .
so i &apos;m supposed to kiss his ass forever because of that ?
no , you &apos;re supposed to make peace .
jessica , i &apos;m willing to make peace ,
but that &apos;s never gonna happen .
why not ?
because louis is never gonna forgive mike .
then figure out a way to make him forgive mike .
donna , how many times have i told you
i want you out front ?
i &apos;m the only associate with a secretary .
it would be nice if people could see my secretary .
well , then maybe your next secretary can figure out
where to put this without coming into your office .
you &apos;re kidding ?
not kidding .
you didn &apos;t forge this ?
i am a lot of things , but i am not a monster .
i would do that to neither michael nor you .
oh , so he &apos;s michael now ?
well , i &apos;m donna to him .
he &apos;s michael to me , which is what i told his airness
when he called .
wait a second . you &apos;re not kidding .
he signed with me ?
well , technically , he signed with me .
holy shit , donna . we have to celebrate tonight .
oh , i &apos;m gonna celebrate .
you , on the other hand , are having drinks with louis .
what ? we &apos;ve been over this .
whenever louis asks to have drinks with me ,
the answer &apos;s always no .
listen to the words that i &apos;m saying .
you are getting drinks with louis tonight .
fairchild &apos;s retiring ?
fairchild &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s almost as good as the jordan news .
not to fairchild .
who gives a shit about fairchild ?
the real tragedy is i have to get drinks with louis .
which is why i got you a secluded restaurant
with a table in the back where no one will see you .
and you &apos;ll call a half an hour in
and say there &apos;s an emergency .
already in place , and if i can &apos;t get through ,
then i &apos;ll just have the waiter
spill drinks all over louis .
you could have that done ?
oh , please .
i could have louis held captive
in a tibetan monastery if i wanted to .
yeah , i don &apos;t think you have that--
now get the hell out of your office .
i got work to do .
excuse me . can you tell me where
jim o &apos;donnell &apos;s office is ?
that depends . what do you know about immigration law ?
what , are we talking visas ,
or are you trying to process a labor certification ?
you know about immigration law ?
doesn &apos;t everybody ?
okay , tough guy ,
what do you think about my strategy on this ?
i think it &apos;s a winner .
why is that ?
because everyone knows gonzalez versus state of maryland
was a kick @-@ ass precedent , but your case is better .
it was a kick @-@ ass precedent ,
but i &apos;m not sure that my case is better .
oh , it is .
well , what about viteri versus--
trust me , it &apos;s better .
viteri needed magic dust and a sympathetic judge to win .
have we met ?
nope .
but i &apos;m mike , by the way .
claire .
are you sure ? because you look very familiar .
oh , that &apos;s probably because i &apos;ve been delivering packages
to your office for the last two months .
but you haven &apos;t given me the time of day ,
because you didn &apos;t think i was smart enough for you .
it &apos;s 9 : 15 .
wait . that worked ?
it &apos;s working so far , but i &apos;m gonna need to know
your full story if it &apos;s gonna keep working .
well , i &apos;ll tell you the full story
once you give me your phone number .
i &apos;ll give you my number when i know the full story .
how about this ? i &apos;ll tell you everything you want to know
at dinner tomorrow night .
in that case ,
i &apos;ll show you where jim o &apos;donnell &apos;s office is .
jim o &apos;donnell &apos;s office ?
where do you think i just came from ?
i need you do something for me .
okay , what is it ?
never mind what it is .
unless you want to go back to whatever you were doing
before i hired you , you &apos;ll be here at 9 : 00 a.m.
this is the address for your car club .
oh , yeah , your memory .
i &apos;d remember this even if i had your memory .
it was right before our first case together .
you &apos;re right , mckernon motors .
so this time be on time and put your seat belt on ,
because we &apos;re about to take a trip down memory lane .
morning , sunshine .
what are you -- - i think you call it a prunie .
congratulations ,
donna told you my favorite breakfast drink ,
but what does that have to do with the price of tea in antarctica ?
donna also told me that you were pissed ,
because you found out i gave you a client
i didn &apos;t want in the first place .
and you think this is gonna make up for that ?
no , but i think giving you 50 % of mckernon motors will .
what &apos;s the catch ?
the catch is , you and i are about to take a road trip
to their corporate headquarters right now .
you serious ?
i don &apos;t joke about mckernon motors ,
and you know that as well as i do .
to fairchild .
to fairchild . god rest his soul .
screw his soul .
you know how they say &quot; heaven just got another angel &quot; ?
they ain &apos;t saying it now .
why do you keep checking your phone ?
no reason . i just--
please , i &apos;m not an idiot .
we &apos;ve been here 28 minutes , and in 2 minutes ,
donna &apos;s gonna call with some preplanned emergency .
louis , that &apos;s not ...
look
why do you think i used fairchild &apos;s retirement
to get you to have drinks with me ?
because you knew i thought it would never happen ?
because he doesn &apos;t have an heir apparent .
louis , if you &apos;re thinking what i think you &apos;re thinking--
hardman &apos;s not gonna make one of us senior partner .
i &apos;m not talking about one of us .
i &apos;m talking about both of us convincing hardman
that two kick @-@ ass junior partners are worth
as much as one new senior partner .
louis , that is the best idea
you &apos;ve had since i &apos;ve known you .
yeah ?
here &apos;s another one .
when did you come up with this one ?
when you were in the bathroom wasting
7 minutes of our half hour .
don &apos;t you have to get that ?
no , i don &apos;t .
let &apos;s drink to this .
asshole .
that was donna , wasn &apos;t it ?
trevor , this is so stupid .
it &apos;s not stupid , dickhead .
i want you to see it for the first time
from the middle of the room .
it &apos;s your apartment , assface ,
and don &apos;t even think about giving me a wet willie .
you suck the fun out of everything .
go ahead . open your eyes , dickfoot .
&quot; dickfoot &quot; ?
i was gonna use &quot; assface . &quot;
it &apos;s all i could think of .
how do you even manage in the world ?
are you just gonna stand there with your your eyes closed
and mock my &quot; dickfoot &quot; ?
i &apos;m definitely not gonna open them to see your dickfoot .
that &apos;s a good point . i wouldn &apos;t do that either .
go ahead . open your eyes .
holy shit .
i thought you were getting a studio .
yeah , i was going to , but then i realized
we can &apos;t both live in a studio .
what ?
welcome to casa evans and ross .
trevor , i can &apos;t afford half this rent .
that &apos;s the best part .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m gonna pay for your whole first year .
no , you &apos;re not . i can &apos;t let you do that .
michael , i start my new job on tuesday .
on top of that , i have my friends and family business on the side .
that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna take charity from you .
look , are you gonna make me say it ?
it &apos;s not charity .
i graduated , and you didn &apos;t ,
because you took the fall for something i did .
i owe you .
okay , i &apos;ll think about it .
all right , in the meantime , think about this .
no , i can &apos;t .
i got a date tonight .
all right .
wow , clubfoot , mustache , all of the above ?
first dickfoot and then clubfoot ?
are words with &quot; foot &quot; all you &apos;ve got now ?
all right , smart guy ,
describe her with one of your sat words .
bigfoot .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
for the record , she &apos;s really hot .
let me get this straight .
instead of promoting an existing partner ,
you want me to make both of you junior partners .
well , not make us . we &apos;ve earned it .
earned partnership status ?
that &apos;s a pretty bold statement
coming from two fifth @-@ years .
not just any fifth @-@ years .
we &apos;re the best fifth @-@ years this firm has ever seen ,
and you know it .
may i inquire whose idea this was ?
it was both of ours .
it was louis &apos; .
that &apos;s generous of you
to give him credit .
it was generous of him to come to me with the idea .
the truth is , i wasn &apos;t gonna make anyone partner .
but i do like admire your gumption .
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m willing to do .
i will advance one of you
if you prove to me which one it should be .
no , see , that &apos;s the whole point .
we came in as a package deal .
you came in with a proposal .
i &apos;m giving you a counter , and it &apos;s take it or leave it .
what sort of proof are we talking about ?
let &apos;s just say mckernon motors is in play ,
and landing them could go a long way to making your case .
no way . we &apos;re not gonna ..
all right , daniel .
you want mckernon ?
i &apos;ll get you mckernon .
we &apos;re going to mckernon motors , not your senior prom .
why can &apos;t we just take the car service ?
because we &apos;re going to an engine manufacturer .
we need to show up with a bad @-@ ass car .
how about this little bad boy right here ?
that &apos;s no good .
why the hell not ?
because it &apos;s not just the two of us .
what do you mean ?
you son of a bitch .
you said you and i are going up there .
you lied to me .
because if i didn &apos;t , you would have never agreed to come .
there is no way i &apos;m going .
yes , you are .
i don &apos;t care if i have to tie you to the roof .
by the time we get to mckernon ,
you and mike are gonna work your shit out .
i can &apos;t believe you did that .
the plan was to present a united front .
and we did , and he didn &apos;t go for it .
then you stab me in the back ?
i didn &apos;t stab you in the back . i took what he gave us .
he didn &apos;t give us anything , harvey .
he pitted us against each other .
louis , we &apos;ve been pitted against each other
since day one .
what are you talking about ?
how many of the 50 associates we started with
do you think are gonna make partner ?
i don &apos;t give a shit about the other associates .
we toasted to making partner together .
i don &apos;t make the rules , louis . hardman does .
and as much as we say he &apos;s an asshole ,
i respect him for at least telling us the deal out loud .
you want something out loud ?
i &apos;m gonna give you something out loud .
no way on earth am i gonna let you land mckernon motors .
hey , what the hell ?
what the hell what ?
this isn &apos;t a joyride , louis .
you don &apos;t want to talk , you &apos;re gonna sit in silence
until you &apos;re ready to talk .
well , you can make me sit in silence all you want ,
but you can &apos;t make me work it out with him .
then what can , louis ?
excuse me ?
you worked it out with donna and rachel .
you lied to malone for jessica .
what &apos;s it gonna take to work it out with me ?
well , i forgave those people , because they were victims
infected with the disease known as mike ross .
now i &apos;m stuck in a car with patient zero .
okay , outbreak , patient zero is the first person
actually infected with the disease ,
not the disease itself , and for your information ,
i &apos;m stuck in the same car as you .
at least you don &apos;t have to look at
the back of your own stupid ,
fat , balding head .
what &apos;s so goddamn funny ?
you two are finally talking .
i think you earned a little music .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah .
all you have to do is pick one of two characters .
and whichever character i don &apos;t pick
is removed from film history forever ?
it &apos;s like they never existed .
it &apos;s a piece of cake .
okay , han solo or indiana jones ?
i &apos;m out .
what &apos;s the problem ?
you just said it was gonna be a piece of cake .
the problem is , you just picked the two greatest characters
of all time , so ...
you &apos;re right about that . i &apos;m sorry .
let me start with something easier for you .
all right .
butch or sundance ?
mm , check , please .
yeah , we &apos;re done .
no .
this is really nice .
yeah , i &apos;m having a really good time too .
so when do i get to hear the answer to what you do
besides being a bike messenger ?
who says i do anything ?
look , mike , there &apos;s nothing wrong
with being a bike messenger , but i &apos;m serious about my life .
i &apos;m not going to law school just to cash out .
i really want to help people .
bike messengers don &apos;t help people ?
no , not in the way that a man i want to be
in a relationship with does .
well , then today is your lucky day .
i knew it . where do you go ?
mm @-@ mm , you first . where do you go ?
nyu .
columbia .
i win .
i win .
good morning , jessica .
hi , daniel .
i still haven &apos;t received--
this year &apos;s budget ?
i was just on my way to give it to you .
and i thought maybe you hadn &apos;t gotten around to it
because you were too busy pitting harvey against louis .
you disapprove .
i don &apos;t mind a little healthy competition .
but i do mind the empty promise of partnership .
what makes you so sure there &apos;s no reward at the end ?
the last time we discussed this ,
you said harvey wasn &apos;t ready .
and you said louis wasn &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m giving them both the chance to prove it .
so partnership is on the table .
partnership was already on the table .
what makes you so sure it &apos;s gonna be harvey ?
because harvey will do whatever it takes to win .
if doing whatever it takes is the criteria ,
my money is on louis .
what are you talking about ?
i think we should continue this conversation in my office .
hi , i &apos;ve got a delivery for a zoltan freastmeisterson .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s no one in this office with that name .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re mistaken .
really ?
yeah .
because i &apos;m willing to bet that there &apos;s no one on this planet
with that name .
okay , fine , but if you could just point me towards
kumquat mcgillicuddy &apos;s office ,
i &apos;ll be on my way ,
because i certainly did not bike down here
with two fictitious deliveries just to tell you
what a great time i had last night .
good , because i have a lot of work to do .
so , if you could please just hop on that little bike of yours--
claire ?
yeah .
when you &apos;re finished flirting with quicksilver here ,
you might want to get down to ins .
hector suarez just got taken in .
shit . his visa &apos;s expired .
they &apos;re gonna send him back to the dominican republic .
wait . maybe i can help .
no offense , i don &apos;t see how you can--
no , no , no , nathan , he &apos;s not just a bike messenger .
he &apos;s in law school .
really ?
where are you in law school ?
columbia .
and he happens to know visas better than either one of us .
well , i really can &apos;t pay you , so ...
no , i don &apos;t need any money .
i just want to help .
all right , columbia , be my guest .
got a hearing tuesday morning , 9 : 00 a.m.
mike , that is amazing . thank you .
oh , no , don &apos;t thank me yet . i haven &apos;t even done any--
um , this might not be relevant , but i actually saved
kumquat mcgillicuddy &apos;s life this morning , so ...
i &apos;m gonna go do some work .
thank you .
mr. mckernon , harvey specter .
mr. specter , would you mind telling me why i have
two different pearson hardman lawyers
on my schedule today ?
i don &apos;t know , but after this ,
you won &apos;t need to meet the other one .
you &apos;re cocky .
i &apos;m right .
you &apos;re also traveling a little light .
where &apos;s your powerpoint presentation ?
i don &apos;t need a powerpoint presentation .
why is that ?
because every lawyer in the city has tried to dazzle you ,
and you &apos;re still looking for a date to the big dance ,
because they don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for .
what exactly am i looking for ?
loyalty .
you &apos;re right .
i built this company from the ground up ,
and everybody that started with me is still here .
and i know why .
you don &apos;t downsize in the bad times .
they stick with you in the good times .
and no other lawyer has figured that out .
not a single one .
well , i &apos;m the one , avery ,
which is why i know you don &apos;t want me dumping you
for a bigger client down the line .
how do i know you won &apos;t do that ?
because that &apos;s not the way i work .
well , it &apos;s a hell of a nice sentiment .
but how do i know you &apos;re not full of shit ?
i &apos;m glad you asked ,
because here &apos;s my powerpoint presentation .
okay ...
i have a hearing tomorrow against fletcher engines .
you win that , you &apos;re my lawyer .
ok , just don &apos;t change lanes ,
don &apos;t change lanes .
don &apos;t do this . great . okay , you know what ?
this is ridiculous . you drive like a savage animal .
louis , be a man and suck it up .
suck it up ? i &apos;m sitting in the death seat .
fine . i &apos;ll pull over , and you can sit in the back with mike .
hey , i &apos;m not sitting in the back with a fraud ,
and before you even think it , you &apos;re not putting him up here
and sticking me back there .
then what do you want , louis ?
because there is no way in hell
i &apos;m letting you behind the wheel of this car .
it &apos;s crystal goddamn clear .
you and i sit in the back , and he chauffeurs the both of us .
whoa , no . even if harvey would agree to that ,
which i doubt--
shut the hell up .
you &apos;re not talking . you don &apos;t get to refuse .
i &apos;m not refusing , louis . i don &apos;t know how to drive .
holy shit .
you wanted to see me ?
uh , yes .
i heard you did well with avery mckernon .
well , then you heard wrong ,
because i killed it with avery mckernon .
congratulations , harvey .
thank you , daniel .
you &apos;re welcome .
unfortunately , we can &apos;t represent mckernon motors after all .
why not ?
well , it turns out fletcher engines wants to sign with us .
because they found out i &apos;m about to land mckernon .
yes ,
and they &apos;re three times the size of mckernon motors .
well , i don &apos;t care how big they are .
i &apos;m not dropping my client .
yes , you are .
this was your plan all along .
of course it was . that &apos;s how the world works .
i don &apos;t give a shit how the world works .
i gave my word to avery mckernon .
watch yourself , harvey .
i haven &apos;t gotten where i am by watching myself , daniel .
and i don &apos;t appreciate being used as a stalking horse .
well , you may not appreciate it , but let me remind you ,
you work for me .
and i &apos;m giving you the chance to show me you understand that .
let me remind you you said partnership was on the table .
i &apos;m gonna hold you to that , and so will jessica .
hey , fart taster .
i thought you were coming over .
what , nothing ? it &apos;s a classic .
i &apos;m implying your job is to literally taste--
hey , trevor , i &apos;m in the middle of something ,
so i &apos;ll come over later , okay ?
in the middle of what ?
that girl i told you about ,
she interns at a legal clinic ,
and i am helping her with a case .
dickfoot gave you homework ?
okay , first of all , from now on , her name is claire .
and second of all , this is important , so ...
dude , what the hell are you talking about ?
i might have told her that i &apos;m in law school .
holy shit .
you will do anything to get laid .
i am not trying to get laid .
i really like this girl ,
and i have zero chance with her
if all i am is a bike messenger .
yeah , well , you &apos;re definitely gonna have no chance
if she finds out that you lied to her .
trevor , i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
you don &apos;t really want to talk about anything anymore .
it &apos;s about the apartment , isn &apos;t it ?
yes it &apos;s about the apartment .
okay , you want the truth ?
i haven &apos;t given you an answer because of grammy .
you think i didn &apos;t know that ?
then you know she &apos;s never forgiven you
for what happened in college ,
and she is never , ever going to let me live with you .
then explain to her that this is my way
of making up for what i did in college .
that is never gonna work .
you know what , michael ?
if you &apos;re gonna do all of this for some girl you just met ,
maybe it &apos;s time you stood up to grammy for me .
how &apos;d it go against fletcher engines ?
you cut them off at the knees or put them in the ground ?
they put me in the ground ,
and on top of that , it was in front of avery mckernon .
you lost in court ?
i didn &apos;t just lose . i looked like a fool .
harvey , what happened ?
the general counsel for fletcher engines
knew every move i was gonna make before i even made it .
how could he--
because hardman must have tipped him off .
you really think he would do that ?
i wouldn &apos;t have yesterday , but i sure as hell do today .
then you have to go to jessica .
and say what ?
hardman &apos;s managing partner . she &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t have any proof , and i never will .
well , then what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know , but i have less than 14 hours
to dig through 1,000 pages of patent law .
if only there was somebody in the office who was an expert
on patent law .
donna , i am not going to louis .
he &apos;ll never help me .
well , that &apos;s too bad , because if you can &apos;t figure out
how to patch things up with louis ,
then you don &apos;t deserve avery mckernon
or that partnership .
what &apos;s all this ?
uh , a grandson can &apos;t order in and set a table
for his grandmother ?
a grandson can do whatever he wants .
but the answer to your question is no .
you haven &apos;t even heard what it is yet .
i know what it is , because i &apos;ve been waiting for it
since that kid graduated ,
and you are not gonna live with him .
that boy is the reason you got kicked out of school .
you &apos;re the one that told me to tell the dean the truth .
that was before i knew it would cost you graduating .
and he &apos;s trying to make it up to me .
he &apos;s gonna pay for my whole first year &apos;s rent .
that will not make up for putting your whole life
into a tailspin .
it &apos;s a head start .
no , it &apos;s not a head start !
that boy is gonna drag you back down with him !
grammy , i &apos;m never gonna let that happen !
god damn it ! i forbid it !
i &apos;m sorry , michael . i lost my temper .
but i know what he does to you ,
and i know he &apos;ll always be the same .
has it occurred to you that maybe i &apos;m not the same ?
what &apos;s changed ?
i met someone .
and i &apos;m gonna figure out a way to finish school , and ...
and then i &apos;m gonna go to law school .
good .
then do it from here
what &apos;s on your mind , mike ?
you look lost in thought .
i was just thinking about my grandmother .
we took a train trip to d.c. once .
we played i spy .
that &apos;s a nice story , mike , but we are not playing i spy .
i &apos;ll play . it &apos;ll remind me of dominating esther on our trips
to see our smelly aunt frida .
all right , if it will get you and mike talking , sure .
i spy a fraud
who probably never even knew his grandmother .
all right , god damn it , you got a problem with me ,
take it up with me ,
but don &apos;t ever talk about my grandmother again .
oh , i forgot ,
the poor orphan from new york city
who i should feel sorry for because he never learned to drive .
i &apos;m telling you , watch yourself .
why ? because i hurt your feelings ?
louis !
i don &apos;t care .
for all i know , you &apos;re probably not even an orphan .
louis !
it sure as hell wouldn &apos;t be the first time a con man
tried to make that claim .
that &apos;s enough .
no , it isn &apos;t .
yes , it is . pull the car over right now .
i &apos;m gonna beat the shit out of him .
hey , you got a minute ?
oh , wait . let me turn my back ,
so i can give you the right angle to---
you were right . we should have stuck together .
i get it-- you need my help ,
because you got your ass wiped in court this morning .
you &apos;re right . i did get my ass kicked this morning ,
but it wasn &apos;t a fair fight .
what are you talking about ?
hardman accessed my computer
and fed the other side my game plan .
okay , i &apos;m still waiting for the part
where i &apos;m supposed to give a shit .
hardman did it because i refused to dump mckernon
for fletcher after i gave him my word .
and why should i help you
when you couldn &apos;t live up to your word to me ?
i did live up to my word .
we went to daniel--
oh , bullshit .
no , it &apos;s not bullshit .
i welcomed your idea with open arms ,
and by the way , when he asked whose idea it was ,
i gave you the credit .
you see , harvey , that &apos;s the part you will never understand .
i didn &apos;t want the credit .
i wanted us to be a team .
then let &apos;s be a team right now .
but you don &apos;t want to be a team .
you want me to help you get mckernon
so you can make partner .
i want you to help me so i can keep my word to avery mckernon .
and when i become partner ,
i &apos;ll keep my word to you .
what the hell word is that ?
that someday what you wrote on that napkin
goes up on the goddamn wall .
you seem to have done a lot of work here , mike .
oh , it &apos;s no big deal .
it is a big deal .
mike found a loophole in the immigration act of 1975,
and it &apos;s gonna blow you away .
i don &apos;t know about that ,
but it may help hector suarez stay in the country .
that &apos;s great .
and you &apos;re more than welcome to stay and watch .
unfortunately , claire ,
i need you to run back to the office .
marshall called in sick .
i need someone to handle the walk @-@ ins , so ...
okay .
call me . tell me how it goes .
yeah .
what the hell are you doing ? that &apos;s--
gonna keep hector suarez in the country ?
yeah .
yeah , nothing &apos;s gonna keep him in the country .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m gonna buy him some time
so he can get his affairs in order ,
and then i &apos;m gonna give his children a chance to stay .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
are you jealous of me and claire or ...
hey , look , i &apos;m not jealous , and i was waiting
for her to leave to save you the embarrassment .
the embarrassment of what ?
that &apos;s good work .
i &apos;m not talking about the work .
i &apos;m talking about your &quot; bike messenger by day ,
law student by night &quot; bullshit .
all right , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
what are you gonna tell me next ?
your roommate is a stripper who &apos;s in medical school ?
tell me right now--i call columbia ,
your story holds up .
that &apos;s what i thought .
forget who i am , and take a look at that folder .
this is a man &apos;s life .
don &apos;t touch me .
if you know what &apos;s good for you ,
you &apos;ll stay the hell away from claire .
daniel ...
did you know that some of these species
can live up to 200 years ?
fascinating .
did you know fletcher engines is picking up the pieces ?
i guess congratulations are in order .
i not here for a pat on the back .
i &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re making me partner .
partner ?
i never said signing mckernon was the key to making partner .
yes , you--
all i said was landing them could go a long way
toward making your case .
bullshit .
you said partnership was on the table .
and i said i was gonna hold you to it .
and i &apos;m going to right now .
you don &apos;t hold me to anything .
but i did say partnership was on the table ,
and it is ...
just not for you .
what are you talking about ?
well , i can &apos;t very well make you partner
after i just told louis i &apos;m making him partner .
what ?
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
this isn &apos;t about bringing in business .
this is about figuring out who would do whatever it takes .
i did whatever it took .
you didn &apos;t do a thing .
you had the chance to triple our business ,
and all you had to do was take a knee .
you mean bend a knee .
yes , that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
but you &apos;re an arrogant little boy
who would rather win than get in line .
well , what the hell did louis do to get in line ?
he did whatever it took .
please get away from me .
claire , wait .
nathan told me everything .
just let me explain , okay ?
no , explain what-- that you &apos;re a sociopath ?
i &apos;m not a sociopath .
i &apos;m the same guy that you hit it off with .
no , you &apos;re not . you lied to me .
yes , i am , and i didn &apos;t mean to lie to you , okay ?
i was gonna tell you the truth .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
because you said you wanted to be with a guy
who was doing something good with his life ,
and i wasn &apos;t .
so what , now you &apos;re here to tell me that all of a sudden ,
you want to dedicate your life to helping people
or some other lie like that ?
it &apos;s not a lie , and what i did would have helped hector suarez .
yeah , but you only did it--
claire , please , you have to believe me .
after i met you , i decided to get my shit together .
i am trying to get my shit together .
okay , mike , you know what i hate more
than guys who don &apos;t have their shit together ?
it &apos;s guys who lie about getting their shit together .
claire .
louis , fill up the tank . i &apos;ll be back .
well ?
well , what ?
you heard what he said . fill up the tank .
yeah , i did hear what he said .
he said , &quot; louis , fill up the tank . &quot;
well , where i come from , it &apos;s people who didn &apos;t go to college
who fill up gas tanks .
yeah , and where i come from ,
if you take another step towards me--
oh , what , the tough kid from the city is gonna beat my ass ?
louis , i &apos;m telling you right now ...
you ruined my life . you ruined my firm .
louis !
you son of a bitch .
wait . harvey--
tell me right now you weren &apos;t the one
that gave fletcher engines my game plan .
hardman told me he wasn &apos;t gonna make you partner anyway .
and once he offered it to me , all i had to do was--
sell me out .
how is what i did any different than you going after
mckernon motors in the first place ?
if you don &apos;t understand that on your own , you never will .
so , from now on , you stay on your side of the yard .
i &apos;ll stay on mine .
no , harvey , listen to me .
you told me you would fight to get our names on the wall
once you got on the other side .
i can do the same for you .
did you hear what i just said ?
i don &apos;t want you doing shit for me .
oh , so it would be okay if you were the one
who got there first ?
it would have been okay if you got there first
fair and square ,
because then i would have believed you
when you said you wanted to be a team .
i do want to be a team , harvey .
that &apos;s why i helped you after .
no , you don &apos;t !
you don &apos;t want to be a team .
you just want to have it both ways ,
because you &apos;re a disloyal rat .
you always have been , and you always will ,
no matter what it says on your door .
well , like you said , we &apos;ve been pitted against each other
since day one .
you asked how many of the 50 associates we started with
would make partner .
well , you know what ? i don &apos;t give a shit about the other 49,
because i &apos;m the one who did .
i &apos;m the one who did .
and now get the hell out of my face ,
because i have work to do .
you know he did that on purpose , right ?
did what on purpose ?
he asked you to fill the tank because he knew what you &apos;d do .
knew what i would do ?
what about what you would do ?
he knew that too .
louis ...
you never even said you were sorry .
i am sorry , louis .
i &apos;m sorry that i lied to you .
i &apos;m not a con man , louis .
every single other thing i ever told you was true .
want to know something that
i &apos;ve never even admitted to myself ?
i never learned to drive for the same reason
i never went to law school .
both my parents were killed in a car accident .
and ever since then , i &apos;ve never been able to--
get behind the wheel .
and then harvey gave me a license , and i took it .
you were 11 years old .
i mean , you must have felt so alone .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t believe i was an orphan .
i looked it up .
i had to once i found out that you never went to law school .
you mean once you found out that i &apos;m a fraud .
you &apos;re not a fraud , mike .
you just never went to law school .
okay , frazier , you get a grape .
ali , i got you a fruit punch .
you two work your shit out ?
i &apos;ll take that as a yes . let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
i should never have lied to her .
oh , screw her , man .
if she doesn &apos;t like you for who you are ,
she doesn &apos;t deserve you .
it &apos;s not claire &apos;s fault . it &apos;s mine .
i know you were into her and everything ,
but trust me ,
there are plenty of other fish in the sea .
you don &apos;t know that .
for all you know , i &apos;m never gonna meet
another girl like her again .
michael--
trevor , if i &apos;m gonna have to listen
to whatever you &apos;re about to say ,
i &apos;m gonna need a joint first .
come on , i thought you were trying to turn your life around .
i &apos;ll turn my life around tomorrow .
but tonight i &apos;m a bike messenger , so ...
dude--
trevor .
all right .
fine .
and i know grammy doesn &apos;t want you living here ,
but you can crash here tonight if you want .
donna .
something wrong ?
why would something be wrong ?
because i don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve ever been in my office before .
no , nothing &apos;s wrong .
and i know it &apos;s not my place ,
but i &apos;m here to tell you that i think you &apos;re making a mistake .
is this about me not giving people off for columbus day ?
you know this isn &apos;t about that .
harvey laid it on the line with daniel ,
and you didn &apos;t have his back .
donna , i &apos;ve had harvey &apos;s back since the day i met him .
for your information ,
when i found out what daniel was up to ,
i had him guarantee partnership was on the table .
and then you let him give it to the wrong man .
that is on harvey , not on me .
what are you talking about ?
daniel was worried that harvey couldn &apos;t
put the firm &apos;s best interests ahead of his own ,
and harvey proved him right .
or maybe you &apos;re just telling yourself that
because you don &apos;t want to stand up to daniel hardman .
donna , there &apos;s a reason why you are where you are
and i am where i am ,
and that is because one of us sees the bigger picture .
you knew about fletcher engines ?
what i know is that harvey &apos;s time will come .
and if this little incident gets him to think about other people
for a change , then i &apos;ll take it .
you &apos;re up early .
i &apos;m up early , because i couldn &apos;t sleep .
where we you all night ?
you know where i was .
i was staying at my new apartment .
i thought we &apos;d settled this .
you settled it . i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m telling you , that kid--
grammy , for as long as i can remember ,
you &apos;ve been calling him &quot; that kid &quot;
or &quot; that boy &quot; or worse .
his name is trevor .
and he &apos;s my best friend .
look , i &apos;m gonna do this thing with or without your blessing ,
but ...
it sure would be nice to have it .
okay , michael .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you and pretend i approve ,
but ...
you &apos;re a grown man , and i respect your decision .
i love you , grammy .
i love you too .
thank you .
i believe that &apos;s all i need to know .
thank you for your time , ms. pearson .
i will wait to hear from you .
oh , one more thing--
does your father know you came to me for a job ?
i @-@ i--
did you really think i didn &apos;t know
you were robert zane &apos;s daughter ?
is that why you &apos;re interviewing me ?
because if it is ,
i would like to remove myself from consideration .
if you don &apos;t want to work for your father ,
that &apos;s your business .
i &apos;m hiring you because i like what i see .
hiring me ?
you start monday , if that &apos;s not too much trouble .
i will be the first one in .
aren &apos;t you gonna ask me why i don &apos;t want to work with my father ?
i know why .
i have a dad just like yours .
he has his own law firm ?
he &apos;s a surgeon .
but it &apos;s the same damn thing .
how are we on time ?
we &apos;re perfect .
but i &apos;m not going in there . you two are .
what are you talking about ?
i said i was giving you 50 % of mckernon .
i didn &apos;t say i was keeping the other 50 % .
oh , so you finally realized they need an upgrade
in representation .
easy , frazier .
you &apos;d still be out cold at that gas station
if i hadn &apos;t saved your ass .
okay , i would have gotten out ... eventually .
not from where i was standing .
i &apos;m slippery .
i told you-- i wrestled in high school .
i checked on that . he did .
see ?
oh , and now you &apos;re fighting for him ?
okay , i guess my job here is done .
wait , where are you going ?
i &apos;m taking the car , back to the city .
what the hell we suppose to do ?
ray is wating on the other side of the parking , isn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;ll drive you two back when you &apos;re done
wait , you know , i have a better idea .
how about you take ray , we take the car ,
and i &apos;ll teach mike how to drive on the way home .
you &apos;d actually do that ?
yeah , i would .
no way .
you don &apos;t trust me ?
i don &apos;t trust you as far as i can throw you ,
you &apos;re a god damn fraud .
that &apos;s what i said .
harvey , seriously , i promise ...
okay , i know you will .
louis , you make one dent in the car ,
mike &apos;s back on the street , your name &apos;s off the door .
you think he &apos;s serious about what he said ?
come on .
just a little nervous ,
cause i feel like i drank the power drink ,
has a lot soda in it ,
actrually , it &apos;s a dirty hot dog ,
okay .
the doctor says it raise my blood pressure .
i would let you to give the talk .
