Let me see it.
You understand how this works?
Yeah, I'm being released into the custody of the FBI
under your supervision.
This is a temporary situation.
Help me catch the dutchman, we can make it permanent.
The Spanish Victory Bond.
This is the only surviving copy.
Except it's a forgery.
I know who the Dutchman is.
Curtis Hagen.
You are a particular kind of bastard!
FBI, you're under arrest.
Neal.
Ellen.
You and your father.
My mom told me he was dead.
But you told me the truth.
He was a dirty cop,
and he's not dead.
You grew up in witness protection.
I was 3 when the marshals took us away.
What happened?
They found a gun with his prints on it.
He killed a cop?
He confessed.
All the information I've found on the others since James' arrest.
Your dad told me
that our department is filled with dirty cops.
And he's right about one thing:
there are dirty cops.
Senator Terrence Pratt.
He's got to be one of the dirty cops Ellen was investigating.
He's the one.
We found the evidence box.
After all these years.
That box belongs to Senator Pratt.
Where is it?
Where's what?
The evidence!
Pratt!
Put down the gun.
He's dead.
Don't move.
Peter, you have the right to remain silent.
Neal, Peter's gun killed Pratt.
There's gunshot residue on Peter's hands.
It doesn't look good.
What did you do, dad?
It was self defense.
You're gonna testify, and you're gonna clear Peter's name.
I can't do it.
The irony of this is not lost on me.
This is my fault.
My father is--
You can't take responsibility for what James did.
He has completely disappeared.
Without his confession--
I know.
There was gunshot residue on my hands,
my prints on the gun,
and no eye witnesses.
I would've arrested me.
Justice will prevail.
Let's damn well hope so.
I have some news to cheer you up.
Federal prosecutor is dropping charges?
No, not that good.
Diana's pregnant.
But how?
She decided to do it on her own.
She's actually pretty far along.
There's so much I might miss.
Hi, hon.
Hi, hon.
I hate for you to see me like this.
What I see is a man who's gonna come back even stronger.
You're gonna beat this, Peter Burke.
You're gonna come home to me.
I will.
I promise.
Neal, it's been six weeks.
I don't think I can take another day,
much less years.
The indictment hearing starts tomorrow.
I know.
But that only decides if he goes to trial.
If he's indicted,
even if he's found innocent,
he can never serve as an FBI agent again.
I don't care about his career.
All I care about is getting him out of there.
I understand that, but--
You care.
That's right. Of course.
Because his job is what's keeping you
from joining him in prison.
I'm sorry, Neal. It was wrong.
No, it's okay.
Peter cares.
And I can't be responsible for taking away his badge.
That's why I want to clear him before the indictment.
Get him home to you as soon as possible.
Do we have any options?
We do, but they mostly involve you two
living under new identities in Alaska.
Anything less nuclear?
Not yet.
Well I've always wanted to drive a snowmobile to work, so.
Do whatever you have to do, okay?
Okay.
I did it!
Unless you found a way to get Peter out of jail,
I don't want to hear about it.
It's a step in that direction.
I cracked your anklet.
What?
This fine piece of technology
took nine months
and most of your wine cabinet,
but because of this,
the FBI will no longer know where you are.
You spent almost a year working on this?
It was supposed to be a surprise.
And for us to take a road trip to the Jersey Shore.
But a prison break is second best.
Moz, this is great.
But how are we going to convince Peter to break out of prison?
Who says we have to convince him?
What, are you going to carry him out?
I don't have the upper-body strength, sadly.
But we could douse him with devil's breath.
We are not dousing him with anything.
Did you tell anyone we were trying to help Peter?
And admit to assisting a suit?
My reputation would never recover.
Why?
Because I didn't either.
"I can help Burke. Opera house. 5:00 P.M.
Come alone."
He's with me.
Curtis Hagen.
Been a long time.
That it has.
And you never sent me a thank you card.
It's because of me you're free to walk around Manhattan.
That thing around your ankle.
It's because I caught you.
Nevertheless.
I was unable to negotiate the same deal.
So you settled for a work release program.
I thought murderers were a high security risk.
I was never arrested for murder.
Only forgery.
It appears that
there's a demand for world-renowned restorers.
I can work for $10 a day,
even if it does require an armed escort.
Are they guarding you,
or guarding for you?
Bit of both, Caffrey.
You know how it goes.
Little bribery goes a long way.
Not long enough to let you go.
Sadly, no.
As you well know.
Otherwise you would've secured Peter Burke's release.
What's your offer?
Pal up with him in prison?
Protect him?
That's not particularly big picture now, is it?
I know how to make Peter Burke a free man.
This is a waste of my time.
If there were a way to free Peter, I would have found it.
You have a federal prosecutor breathing rather heavily
down Peter Burke's neck, do you not?
We do.
What if I told you I was the reason
he was so very determined
to take Peter Burke down?
If you had that kind of pull
I'd ask why you didn't use him to get yourself out.
Would that I could.
Sadly he became a federal prosecutor
after I was incarcerated.
I believe my patience has paid off in other ways though.
What do you want?
I want you to do me a favor.
I need money, soon.
You can afford to bribe guards.
I'm in need of a much bigger sum.
Already have a target.
Simple little smash and grab.
I'd do it myself, but...
If you can pull this off,
we have a deal.
There's one more thing.
There always is.
Federal prosecutor's gonna need a good reason to step away.
Not lose face.
You want me to provide that reason?
Your old man's confession should do quite nicely.
If I could find my father, Peter would already be free.
Indeed.
But from one forger to another,
we both know there are many ways to create another man's words.
You want me to forge my father's confession?
Make it good.
I'll take care of the rest.
So the Dutchman appears out of nowhere offering gifts,
and I'm not suspicious?
You're not alone.
But what other choice do we have?
Like I said, we can--
That doesn't involve a sky hook.
Moz, this is the only option we've found
that doesn't have Peter on the run.
I can make a believable facsimile of James's voice,
there is one catch.
You need as close a voice match as possible.
Like father, like son.
There are familial overlaps of cadence and voice
that will be very helpful.
In spite of everything, he's still my father.
If I record this,
he'll be a fugitive for the rest of his life.
Neal, James did that all by himself.
You're offering redemption that he doesn't deserve.
Do you have any recording of him?
I'll need it for voice matching.
Yeah.
He left me a voicemail right before the con
at the Empire State Building.
It's the only thing I have.
Hey, I'm running a little late,
but I'll be there.
I promise.
See you soon, son.
See you soon, son.
How'd that sound?
Uncomfortably tragic.
I should leave you alone.
No, no. Moz, it's good to have you here.
Come on.
Peter Burke
has been accused of first degree murder,
in the death of senator Terrence Pratt.
We are here today to decide
whether to indict him on these charges.
I'd like to testify on my own behalf.
Mr. Burke--
I want to speak to my history as an agent,
and to my character.
Nothing you say will change my decision.
Sit down.
Because,
as I was about to say,
new evidence has come to light.
My name is James Bennett.
I almost let an innocent man take the fall for me,
But I can't let that happen.
I shot and killed senator Terrence Pratt...
the man who ruined my life,
using Peter Burke's gun.
Peter tried to convince me to stay and face justice.
Instead, I ran.
The only thing he is guilty of
was trusting I would do the right thing.
Unfortunately, this is as close to the right thing
as I can manage.
I hope it's enough.
We analyzed the recording this morning.
It's been authenticated as the voice of James Bennett.
With this evidence in hand,
I see no other option than to drop all charges.
Mr. Burke,
You are free to go.
Good to see you, Peter.
Mark, thanks.
Good to see you, Peter.
Thanks.
Good to have you back in the office, Peter.
Good to be here, Clinton.
Thanks.
If you didn't come back,
I had dibs on this office.
Your feet are on my desk.
Welcome back, Agent Burke.
How'd you do it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't believe for a second James Bennett made that call.
Not without his son convincing him.
I don't know how you found your father,
or how you got him to leave that message, but...
thank you.
I can't admit to an FBI agent
that I consorted with a fugitive.
Come on.
Hello?
I do so apologize for interrupting the homecoming.
How rude of me.
But you're on my clock now.
Oh, you're right.
You fulfilled your end of the bargain.
Now it's my turn.
I missed that squeak.
Bruce, come on in. Yeah.
Come on in.
Thought I saw you earlier.
Didn't want to interrupt a moment.
That was one nice moment.
Well, FBI section chiefs
have a tendency to stick out in a crowd.
I'm afraid to ask you what you're doing in New York and...
and what's in there, but I'm gonna.
It's your future, Peter.
Right, have a seat.
Washington?
I don't--I don't understand.
You've attracted the attention of some very important people,
and they see potential in you.
Bruce, I just got out of prison.
You took down a corrupt senator.
That alone is a huge accomplishment.
But add your track record to that...
And now they want me in D.C.?
Not right away.
This is a good office.
It's a nice space.
But the one next door has a much nicer view,
and it's vacant.
The ASAC's office?
They want me to run white collar division?
Consider it a stepping stone to D.C.
I'm flattered. I--
This is all sudden.
I know.
Think about it.
yeah.
Talk to El.
Yeah.
I'll be around.
Thanks, Bruce.
Hey, boss.
Diana.
Look at you. I--
How long have I been away?
Not that long.
I kept it quiet as long as I could.
Oh, I hope nobody gave you a hard time.
No, everyone's been great.
I just wanted to stay in the field as long as possible.
But eventually, no amount of loose blouse
was gonna hide this little guy.
Little guy?
Yeah, it's a boy.
Uh, you know, I--
I don't mean to be indelicate, but--
It's not Neal's.
No, I wasn't going--
I'm kidding.
Oh, you--
No, I went to a clinic.
His father is a world-class chef with one hell of an IQ.
Good, and his mother is the best damn agent
I ever worked with.
It's a good combo.
So you gonna take that ASAC job?
You heard.
No, I guessed.
That office has been empty for a while
and you would fill it nicely.
I don't know.
It's a big change.
You know, I was scared about
whether I'd be able to balance a career and a baby.
But once I decided, I knew I could do it.
Now I'm excited to do it.
Change can be good, Peter.
Tinted varnish treatment?
You disapprove.
I prefer watercolors for restoration.
It allows any alterations to be reversible.
Something to be said for irreversible decisions,
don't you think?
I'm here, aren't I?
Target.
There's a vault on the eighth floor of the Reinhart building.
What's inside it?
Coins.
Minted from Welsh gold.
Three times the value of normal gold.
And the only worthwhile thing about the Welsh.
Get your money a different way.
No.
This is what I want.
I've a debt of my own and this is the required form of payment.
In two days.
Why so fast?
Because that's when I need it.
Look, I've worked under your rather urgent deadline.
Are you telling me you can't get this done under mine?
Magnetic field, motion detectors,
dual-control combination lock.
We're gonna go through all of this for pocket change?
$2 million dollars in gold coins
isn't exactly pocket change.
This building is a fortress, Neal.
Fortresses have fallen all throughout history.
All it took was someone finding the weak spot.
Well, with all that security,
we better find a way in that
doesn't involve marching through the front door.
Maybe we don't go through the front door.
What if we pull a back draft?
I've put my inner firebug to bed.
Best not to awaken him.
Well, there are other ways to bring the fire department to us.
Well, even if we could,
this is not the kind of building that clears easily.
But the building next door is.
They share a wall.
So we get the fire department to clear that,
we break in and then disappear inside the crowd.
This could work.
You said you cracked the anklet, right?
Yeah.
Okay, this device...
is synced to your anklet.
I flip the switch,
and that's it.
The tracker says you're standing right where you are.
I am standing where I am.
Yeah, right now you are.
But this captures the signal and loops it back to the FBI.
So you can walk away.
And it shows me staying right here?
Exactly.
The only catch is that you and your anklet
have to come back here to turn it off.
Otherwise, your signal can jump locations suddenly.
They'll know it was hacked.
Nice work, Moz.
Come in.
Got a minute?
Well, always for you, suit.
Welcome back, I think.
What?
You.
Barging in here.
Trying to figure out if we're up to something.
It's nice.
Are you up to something?
See?
Like old times.
Can I get you a beer?
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.
I've been offered to run the White Collar division.
I'm gonna take it.
With everything that happened, I just feel that...
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
And there's a chance that it could lead to more.
In washington.
Washington?
Wow, it's--
Congratulations, Peter.
Yeah, thanks.
I've made sure that your deal stays in place.
Never would have doubted you.
I'm proud of you, you know.
I'm sure you were tempted to break me out,
to find a loophole or con someone into getting me free.
But you didn't.
It says a lot.
Justice prevails.
That it did.
I know what you're thinking and no.
You can't use this to preach conspiracy theories.
Of course.
I will however speak conspiracy truths.
Even with the anklet showing me at home
this can't in any way point back to us.
Promise me, Moz.
Very well.
Nothing conspiratorial of any kind.
How depressing.
Perfect! Use that.
Hey, is that a guy up there?
I'm gonna jump!
Excuse me.
We have an emergency situation here.
If everyone could please evacuate the building
in an orderly manner.
Let's go.
Appreciate your cooperation.
Shouldn't be too long.
Thank you so much.
Don't move another step!
Okay.
I'm only here to talk, that's all.
You have my word.
Why are you doing this?
That's a good question.
One I asked myself lately.
Have you lost somebody?
Or your job?
Is this about the government?
About all the secrets that they're keeping from us?
Of course not!
That would be crazy.
I get a lot of jumpers.
Spout off a lot of stuff that sounds crazy,
and then you think about it a little bit and
it makes you wonder.
If they're really crazy or not.
I'm just saying that if you have anything
that you want to say to me,
I'm here to listen.
This one guy told me
that the Vatican had evidence of alien life.
How far-fetched.
The world's most secretive organization
keeping alien technology for their own gain.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
What about the Kennedy assassinations?
I can't take this anymore!
I'm gonna jump!
I thought we were having a conversation.
Relax, man.
Conspiracy theories are not real.
Okay.
Okay, buddy.
I believe you.
I misread you,
and I'm sorry.
So why are you here?
Oh, why do you think?
Because somebody hurt you.
Let's go with that.
Okay, bye.
Okay, hold on.
You're gonna have to be held in psychiatric custody.
72-hour hold for your own protection.
All right, I'll take him down to the sergeant on duty.
All right, don't take your eyes off of him.
I won't.
Come on, quicker, quicker, quicker.
I need to take the tanks.
It's time to load up the equipment.
Yeah, I'll take care of them, all right?
Come on, you know the rules.
The lieutenant's watching.
Look--
Thank you.
This is heavy.
Did I miss something?
Why'd you just give away our gold?
They would've seen my face.
I'll grab the coins once the lieutenant's back is turned.
I think his back is now turned.
So out of the frying pan, into the firehouse.
I didn't have a choice.
Well the good news is that the tanks
look just like all the other ones.
The one with the gold in it will be a little heavier.
It'll pass a cursory examination, but not much else.
Even with this uniform, if I step foot in there,
they'll know I'm not one of them.
So the direct approach is out.
Yep.
Hey, we can wait until the fire truck takes another call.
If the tanks weren't used, they'll still be on the truck.
Yeah, I can grab them...
while they're dealing with their emergency.
That'll have to be the plan.
Peter's calling me in.
All right, I'll set up camp outside the station.
As soon as I can get away, I'll meet you.
We've got a case.
We?
Aren't you ASAC now?
Paper work goes through next week.
Today, I'm a field agent with a bad guy to catch.
One last case.
What is it?
Please don't say mortgage fraud.
Gold coins.
$1.8 million worth of them.
Stolen from a private vault.
Sounds like a good one to end on, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Feels about right.
Lucky for us,
lots of people recorded today's jumper.
Unluckily, we still haven't been able to get a clear shot of him.
We're pretty sure, however,
that he was a distraction for this.
Our thieves broke into a travel agency
in order to burrow into the building next door.
That way they evaded the security system of the building
and got away with the gold.
It's a back draft.
A back draft?
Set a jumper, call the fire department,
they'll clear out the building
and you can steal whatever you want
while they watch the show.
Well, whoever he was,
he slipped away before anyone could properly I.D. him.
And he was high up enough
that no one in the crowd could get a clear picture of him.
He's just the distraction.
It's the guy who grabbed the loot that you need to catch.
I agree, but we don't have eyes on him yet either.
How would you go in?
I'd go into the travel agency posing as a vacationer.
Go out with everyone to watch the jumper,
then double back.
Once I grabbed the coins, I'd change clothes
and blend in with the crowd.
What about the equipment to get through the vault?
He could dress as a businessman,
carry it in a briefcase.
Pause the video.
What are you thinking?
What if the thief had the equipment with him
the entire time?
Go back about seven seconds.
There.
Why carry a pair of compressed air tanks
if there isn't a fire?
He could fit an acetylene torch in one
and stash the gold in the other.
Comb through the footage.
Let's see if we can put a face on this guy.
Jones, find out which fire department responded.
You think this was an inside job?
I'm leaning towards an impersonator,
but either way, the firehouse, that's our best lead.
Are you en route to the firehouse?
I'm about to be.
Unfortunately, so is Peter.
That's an odd choice of strategy.
He's investigating the coin heist
and he's already traced it to the firehouse.
Well, the suit is more than welcome to check it out.
But the fire truck we need will be elsewhere.
What did you do, Moz?
Oh, relax.
My inner firebug is well under control.
All right, good work.
We found our firehouse. You coming?
Sure.
Great.
Are we stealing this?
Oh, they called it a promotion for the ASAC job.
Should have held out for a private jet.
One promotion at a time.
Oh, you gonna slide down the pole?
No!
But you're tempted.
Yeah.
All right, I'll be in in a minute.
All right.
How'd it go?
Empty-handedly.
They must have unloaded the tanks at the station.
You need to stall the suit.
The suit is currently in the station.
Then he's about to hit the jackpot.
All right, head this way. I'll see what I can do.
She's a beaut, isn't she?
Peter Burke, FBI.
This is my consultant, Neal Caffrey.
It's Gannon.
Your office told me you'd be coming.
First off, my guys are legit.
Oh, I'm sure they are.
We believe the man we're looking for
was impersonating a member of your company.
So what do you have on him?
Not much.
He's roughly 6-feet tall.
Solid build.
Well, that really narrows the field.
Where are your men?
Out on a call.
Just me and the kid.
Hey, probie.
Forget the boots,
guys are gonna be hungry when they get back.
Fire up those burners.
I'm curious about some of your equipment.
Your compressed air tanks in particular.
Tanks are upstairs.
But without a warrant and all that,
you know, I got to cover my--
Legal bases. I understand.
Well, is there anyone Peter could call?
Sure, we could phone my supervisor.
That'd be great.
Grease fire?
Probie, you've got to be kidding me.
No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.
It's his first fire. Let's see how he handles it.
Moz, I got them.
Come to the back of the building.
Second floor window.
Okay, throw me the tank.
The tanks won't fit out the window.
Well, tossing handfuls of coins at me
isn't gonna do us much good.
Hold on a second.
That's what I get for hiring my sister's kid.
Sorry.
Jackpot.
Well, hopefully for your second fire
you won't start it yourself.
Sorry about your jacket.
We'll have to figure out a way to replace it.
No, no, no. That's all right.
My--my wife's been trying to get rid of it for years.
She'll be happy.
Right, Neal?
Neal?
Hey, I found these.
You're late.
Fire's out.
What happened to your jacket?
You're breathing it.
Let's look at these tanks.
Marc Chagall was smuggled out of Nazi occupied France
with a forged visa provided by this country
and brought to New York.
An innocent man was set free by illegal means, I get it.
This is the address and unit number of a secure drop site.
The key's inside as well.
What's the gold for, Hagen?
Why's that matter to you?
Because I can tell when I've stepped into a trap.
You lied about having a debt to pay.
I think the gold was used to bribe the federal prosecutor
on Peter's case.
Well, if that's true, that would be very kind of me.
You gave me a target with only one approach
in the time provided-- through the travel agency.
You figured out what I want yet?
Me.
Where were the cameras hidden?
Well, one was up in the corner.
But I really feel this one best captures the moment.
Love the fireman's uniform.
It adds a little color to the blackmail.
What do you want?
My appeal's coming up.
You're gonna help set me free.
So on top of your new, yet-to-be-determined FBI handler
you now have a criminal handler to deal with?
Look, we both knew what I was getting into.
And it's worth it to get Peter back.
If Hagen has a federal prosecutor in his pocket,
why does he need you?
All the prosecutor can do is force the case back to appeal.
We have to make sure the appeal goes through.
I've defended worse people in court.
He's not looking for a lawyer, Moz.
There's evidence at the FBI.
Bonds that Hagen forged back when Peter and I caught him.
He wants us to destroy them.
Out of the firehouse and back into the frying pan.
What you looking at?
Neal Caffrey standing still.
Mm. That happens?
Happened four straight hours yesterday.
Right smack dab in the middle of the room.
Well, maybe he was meditating.
Or changing a very-hard-to-reach light bulb.
That's some light bulb.
My question is whether Neal was ever there to begin with.
He could go off anklet without you knowing?
Isn't that impossible?
Impossible is what Neal Caffrey specializes in.
He knew I was facing jail,
and that if I was found guilty,
he'd be heading back as well.
I'd imagine
he focused a lot of time at cracking that anklet.
Yeah, but if he succeeded and you got out anyways...
He suddenly has a
get-away-from-handler free card.
Where is this all coming from?
We found the air tanks that had the coins
at the fire station
empty.
There was a moment when Neal was alone with them.
It didn't feel right.
You think Neal had something to do with the coin heist?
I don't know.
Neal doesn't steal without a reason.
And I can't think of a single reason why he would do this.
It keeps nagging at me.
Okay. You're doing it again.
You're getting emotionally invested.
This is the reason you landed yourself in jail.
You're right.
It's time for a change.
Come in.
What time is it?
You been working a while?
Ah, you know how it is when you're painting.
You get into a zone.
Can't say I do.
My job is all about perspective.
Being able to look at a situation
and evaluate all the angles.
I realize I can't do that anymore.
What are you talking about?
Jones and Diana,
everyone in the White Collar offices,
we're all family and...
you're a part of that family.
You're also a criminal.
I forget that a lot.
And until you've served out your sentence,
that's exactly what you are.
I've made mistakes because I let emotions cloud my judgment,
and I can't let my next handler make those same mistakes.
You're choosing someone from outside the office
to be my new handler.
Someone with the right perspective.
Someone who will see you as you are.
A criminal.
This is in your best interest.
Could have sworn the other day
you told me how proud of me you were.
I am. I--
I am.
Neal.
I can't risk you going back.
I don't like this any more than you do.
But it's the way it has to be.
Do I want to know what's in the box?
Got a new anklet in.
Any particular reason?
Felt it was time for an upgrade.
This is an all-new one with a new chip set.
Looks the same on the outside.
I think there's a metaphor there somewhere.
You know, it's scary.
What's that?
Feel strange when it's not on.
Like I'm missing something.
That's how used to I've gotten.
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye, Peter.
