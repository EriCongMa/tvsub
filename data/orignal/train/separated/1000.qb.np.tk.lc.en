lynette fought to save her marriage .
i could see it in his eyes . tom still loves me .
carlos decided to change careers .
maybe counseling .
in one week , a counselor does more good
than i &apos;ve done in my entire life .
good news ...
we &apos;re getting married . oh !
came with bad news .
in the middle of his proposal ,
the cops come by to ask about some dead body
they found at the construction site .
so tell me more .
i told &apos; em that i didn &apos;t know anything about it ,
and the police don &apos;t seem like they &apos;re gonna pose a problem .
but it became a problem for bree ...
we &apos;re just making small talk waiting for her lawyer .
small talk &apos;s over .
so she got the perfect lawyer .
let &apos;s go . you don &apos;t need his permission .
you wanna talk to her , you talk to me first .
when it came to her divorce ,
lynette scavo was determined to make things go smoothly .
so when tom was late to pick up the kids ,
she waited patiently .
when he got something in the mail , she held on to it .
and when he left behind something important ,
she brought it to him .
yes , after years of fighting had led her nowhere ,
lynette decided to take the high road .
lynette ?
oh ! hey , gregg .
hey . coming by to see the new offices ?
i bet i could get the c.e.o. to give you a private tour .
wait a second . i am the c.e.o. i know i could .
no , thanks .
i &apos;m just dropping something off that tom forgot at home .
my ex wouldn &apos;t bring anything by for me unless it was ticking .
so ... how &apos;s everything going with your separation ?
i &apos;m guessing you know the answer to that , having been there .
yeah , it &apos;s been two years since my divorce , and it still sucks .
you know , it might not be my place to say it ,
but i think tom &apos;s nuts for letting you go .
that &apos;s very sweet .
so are you seeing anyone ?
that &apos;s ... a little nosey .
sorry . i @-@ i &apos;m just saying , if you ever wanted
to have a drink and vent with somebody who gets it ,
i would gladly be that person .
okay .
sweet again , but i think that might be a little weird
with you being tom &apos;s boss .
yeah , i get that .
i just wouldn &apos;t forgive myself if i didn &apos;t ask .
but never worry if you &apos;re gonna be okay , lynette .
you will . you are the exact kind of woman
that most men out there are looking for .
well , thanks . i @-@ i always liked this picture of us .
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , hey , i &apos;m off on friday ,
so we can leave early for the cabin .
uh , bad news . uh , i checked the weather up there .
it looks like rain for this weekend .
so ? i wasn &apos;t seeing us spending a lot of time outdoors .
i think we have a little ...
&quot; horizontal &quot; to catch up on .
it &apos;s kind of been a while , hasn &apos;t it ?
well , i guess , with , uh , work and everything .
a cabin , the rain ...
a bed .
it &apos;s gonna be a good weekend .
yes , lynette had tried hard
to take the high road in her divorce ...
hey , gregg .
that drink-- i &apos;d actually enjoy that .
but sometimes , the low road was easier to find .
carlos solis was used to sitting in a position of power ,
whether it was behind the wheel of a powerful car ...
at the head of a power lunch ...
or at the helm of a powerful company .
but now that carlos solis had started a new career ,
he suddenly found himself in a much humbler place .
so ... what do you think of my new office ?
okay , i &apos;ll admit it &apos;s a little bit on the bare bones side--
are you kidding ?
all you need is some yellow tape
and a noose hanging from the ceiling ,
and you &apos;ll be ready to entertain .
i like it , daddy .
thank you , baby .
aw , that &apos;s so sweet .
you &apos;re lying to spare your daddy &apos;s feelings .
seriously , honey , there &apos;s a guy down at the department store
who dresses all the windows . maybe he could spruce it up .
&quot; spruce it up &quot; ?
gaby , we can barely keep the lights on here .
our budget is tiny , and every cent goes towards
helping addicts , finding them jobs , housing ...
okay , okay . save it for the pamphlet .
all i &apos;m saying is , if i was an addict ,
rooms like this are why i shoot up in the first place .
okay , behave . listen to your daddy .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! i can &apos;t take the girls to school .
you always take them .
i have to go to work early today .
well , i &apos;m at work right now .
carlos , how much do you make in an hour ?
$ 12 .
i just made $ 12 listening to you tell me you make $ 12 .
gaby , come on . this job is very important to me .
i &apos;m doing very meaningful work . you should be proud of that .
well , when we can pay our mortgage in &quot; meaningful , &quot;
i will be .
hey , buddy . how was school ?
okay . i &apos;m starving . can i have some cookies ?
sure .
didn &apos;t you like the turkey sandwich i made you ?
not really .
i tried to trade it to john gurry
for a book about worms ,
but he backed out &apos; cause you used too much mayo .
sorry . didn &apos;t realize the worm kid was such a gourmet .
what &apos;s this ?
nothing .
wait . your school &apos;s having a soapbox derby .
yeah .
well , that sounds like so much fun .
it &apos;s for dads and sons .
yes ... but it doesn &apos;t say moms can &apos;t do it , too .
that &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t have to do it .
besides , it &apos;s in three days .
oh . that &apos;s really soon .
i guess we should get started .
oh , come on .
i don &apos;t want you to miss out on all the fun .
mom , you can &apos;t make a car .
what makes you say that ?
&apos;cause you can &apos;t even make a turkey sandwich .
well , thank goodness i have the most talented partner .
now come on . we &apos;re wasting time .
let &apos;s get hammering .
seriously ? you &apos;re telling me
you &apos;re against the death penalty ?
i &apos;ve just seen too many cases
where the wrong person gets convicted .
not my clients , of course .
well , i just think our society &apos;s gotten too soft .
we need a powerful deterrent to stop these killers .
you do realize you &apos;re not on trial
for a parking ticket , right ?
kidding . hey , i &apos;m just-- just trying to lighten the mood .
tomorrow &apos;s gonna be fine . it &apos;s just a pre @-@ trial hearing .
yes , which brings me one step closer to the real thing .
so what exactly ... will we be doing at this hearing ?
you will sit there and look classy and innocent .
i will try to get as much of their case tossed as i can .
and your success rate at this sort of thing is ?
impressive .
i once defended a woman who ran a brothel .
at the pre @-@ trial , i got the whole thing reduced
to operating a business without a fire door .
that &apos;s terrible .
what ? what , me being a great lawyer ?
no , defending a prostitute . call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but i find that line of work rather distasteful .
so--so if she ran a cigarette company ,
or manufactured handguns , she &apos;s a @-@ ok ,
but--but selling men a little ring @-@ a @-@ ding
makes her a pariah .
okay , first of all , &quot; ring @-@ a @-@ ding &quot; ?
second , sex , isn &apos;t a commodity . it &apos;s ... sacred .
yeah , i &apos;ll say , and for this woman ,
sacred cost 400 bucks a pop .
can we please stop talking about it ? it &apos;s tawdry .
and that little crack about manufacturing handguns ?
i hope that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re anti @-@ gun .
i &apos;ve sued the n.r.a. three times .
it is my dream to one day take those sons of bitches down .
well , when it comes to my guns , you &apos;re gonna have to pry them
out of my cold , dead hands .
&quot; guns &quot; ? plural ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what , is that so you can , uh , coordinate your firearms
with your shoes ?
you and i are never gonna agree on anything , are we ?
this salad kind of sucks .
i agree .
not with the language , but with the observation .
i have never met anyone
who can pull off a cape like you , mrs. duncan .
and this is our last one ,
so i &apos;m not letting you leave here without it .
uh @-@ oh . another stray from the land of elastic waistbands .
avert your eyes . i &apos;ll get rid of her .
hello , dear .
you must have taken a wrong turn .
sensible shoes are one floor down .
oh , actually , i &apos;m looking for a personal shopper .
i need help .
okay . um ...
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , champagne . oh--
oh , no , no . this is just for high @-@ end customers .
and me . my husband &apos;s an alcoholic .
so i can only drink at work .
i &apos;m looking to freshen up my wardrobe .
i haven &apos;t bought new clothes in quite some time .
i understand . fixed income ?
no . my rich husband was a stingy son of a bitch ,
and now he &apos;s toes up . i am ready to spend .
who was your husband ?
william hammond .
as in the hammond theater ?
mm @-@ hmm .
and the hammond hospital ?
yep .
and the hammond library ?
so you &apos;ve heard of him .
are you kidding ?
i &apos;ve been to shows in that theater ,
i &apos;ve given birth in that hospital ,
and i went into that library once for directions .
oh . well , sit down
while i pull you some clothes .
oh . there you go .
well , thank you .
oh , honey . look at that cape .
that looks interesting .
give me that . you look like batman .
there you go .
and for the reception , i was thinking of a jazz band .
wouldn &apos;t that be cool ?
eh , i like jazz . uh , but if you &apos;re interested
in a little , uh , traditional australian music ,
i know this guy who plays a badass didgeridoo .
jazz it is .
okay , we &apos;ve done enough .
let me clean this up , and then we can go upstairs
for a preview of our wedding night .
oh , now you &apos;re talking . i &apos;ll grab some wine .
i know this might surprise you ,
but i actually have a few moves saved up
for my first night as mrs. ben faulkner .
uh ... it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t believe it .
i just ... can &apos;t imagine ... what &apos;s left .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s just some , uh , some business stuff
that i need to take .
no , it &apos;s a subpoena .
you &apos;re on the witness list for bree &apos;s trial ? why ?
uh , beats me . i @-@ i th @-@ think they made a mistake .
kind of a coincidence , though .
well ... the cops questioning you
about that body they found on site
and then bree getting arrested for killing the guy ?
ben , don &apos;t lie to me .
i can handle anything you tell me ,
just as long as it &apos;s the truth .
um ... okay .
listen , renee , let &apos;s just drop this , okay ?
no . i &apos;m about to become your wife .
you wanna keep a secret
about touching another boy &apos;s didgeridoo at summer camp , fine .
but not about a murder .
holy crap .
i &apos;m right .
tell me what &apos;s going on , or i &apos;m walking out of this house .
you &apos;re gonna need to let me think about it .
i don &apos;t believe this .
my , uh , my first husband kept secrets from me ,
and it ended our marriage .
i &apos;m not going down this road again .
gaby , why is there an old lady
sitting at our dining room table ?
do you have any idea who that is ?
i think my generic reference to her as &quot; old lady &quot;
kinda says i don &apos;t .
she &apos;s doris hammond ,
as in hammond investments .
ring any bells ?
bill hammond &apos;s widow ?
guy made a killing in private equity .
why is she here ?
she &apos;s my best customer down at cumberly &apos;s ,
i think mostly &apos; cause she sees me as her friend .
oh . so you thought you &apos;d exploit that--
invite a lonely widow to dinner ,
pretend she &apos;s your friend ,
just to make money off of her .
exactly .
gaby , can &apos;t i just take my plate upstairs ?
i &apos;m exhausted .
you &apos;re exhausted ?
i had to watch a 20 minute iphone video
of her cat taking a nap in a laundry basket
just to sell her a coat .
now get out there , lose your top button ,
and look pretty .
doris , i can &apos;t get over how lovely that jacket looks on you .
isn &apos;t it lovely , carlos ?
yeah , it &apos;s great .
oh , i almost had a heart attack when i saw the price .
i guess i just have to get comfortable
with the idea of spending money .
that &apos;s right , and tomorrow when the new fall line comes in ,
we &apos;re gonna get you real comfortable .
so , carlos ...
what is it you do ?
i ... work for a nonprofit that helps recovering addicts .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
was carlos talking about his charity ?
good thing we weren &apos;t operating heavy machinery ,
huh , doris ?
you &apos;ll have to excuse my wife .
not the biggest fan of what i do .
oh , that &apos;s silly .
philanthropy is very important .
my bill gave generously to many worthy causes .
okay , if we &apos;re gonna keep talking about charity ,
i &apos;ll make coffee . we &apos;re gonna need it .
boy , bill left quite a legacy .
have you ever thought about carrying that on ?
oh , i &apos;d love to , but i wouldn &apos;t know where to begin .
maybe i could help .
so my ex &apos;s lawyer says , &quot; we believe it &apos;s fair
for mr. limon to pay an additional $ 1 million . &quot;
and i said--and this is how my mouth
always gets me in trouble--
&quot; so that comes out to what ,
about $ 1 a pound &quot; ?
oh , man . and the judge ...
not amused , which is why i wound up paying
an additional $ 2 million .
ohh . tom and i are going to try to do this without lawyers .
what does that mean , &quot; huh &quot; ?
we &apos;ve known each other 25 years .
we have kids together .
and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s all great , but there is another person involved .
jane .
and trust me , she is gonna be in his ear the whole time
about the settlement .
by the way , i do not get the attraction there .
well , let &apos;s save that topic for another night .
we can do hours on that one .
another night ?
so this is going pretty good .
yeah . it &apos;s been great .
well , okay , we should do it again .
how about saturday night ?
this saturday &apos;s bad .
tom needs me to switch weekends
because he &apos;s going away with ... jane .
well ... it &apos;d be kind of a shame
if some last @-@ minute stuff came up at work ,
and he wasn &apos;t able to go .
yeah .
i guess that would mean
he wouldn &apos;t have to switch weekends ,
and that would free you up for saturday .
did i get that calculus right ?
are you saying in order to get a date with me ,
you &apos;d mess with tom ?
don &apos;t think of it so much as messing with tom .
think of it more as messing with ...
jane .
jane .
oh , my god . it &apos;s staying together .
how long is this race ?
three minutes .
three minutes !
this can totally stay together for three minutes .
can i go now ?
i was gonna have you help me put on the wheels .
no , thanks . juanita found a dead squirrel ,
so i kinda wanna check it out .
well , of course .
gotta see the dead squirrel .
only touch it with a stick !
no fingers !
blown off for a dead squirrel ?
boy , does that bring back memories .
new hobby ?
oh , m.j. and i are building this soapbox thingy car
for the school &apos;s big race .
you should get tom to help .
he did it with all our boys .
it &apos;s how they learned to swear .
oh . that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll figure it out .
i am telling you , he loves this stuff .
i &apos;m gonna give him a call .
oh , thanks , but i really think it &apos;s better if i do it myself .
but tom can just ...
tom is not ... gonna be around all the time .
i &apos;m sorry . i mean , you know what i mean .
i do . since tom and i split ,
i know how hard it is to be both mom and dad ,
but i also know it &apos;s okay to ask for help .
no . i can do this . i have to .
and you know what ? i think it &apos;s gonna turn out great .
do you always move your lips when you read ?
do you always comment on everything
that bugs you about me ?
i haven &apos;t said a word about your tie .
okay , we &apos;re here for discovery compliance , and trial setting .
ms. stone , mr. weston , you &apos;ve exchanged witness lists ?
the people have no objection to mr. weston &apos;s list .
mr. weston , any objections ?
that depends .
who are the gentlemen from number 16 to 28 ?
i &apos;ve never heard these names before .
your client has .
they &apos;re men she met at a bar , brought home , and had sex with .
this is ridiculous .
your honor , the defense will argue that there &apos;s
no suggestion of a relationship
between ms. van de kamp and mr. sanchez ,
that she never even met him .
because she hadn &apos;t .
some of these men will testify
that she was so intoxicated during their time together ,
that she didn &apos;t remember anything about the liaison .
suggesting that she could have slept with mr. sanchez .
so under ms. stone &apos;s &quot; forgetful slut &quot; theory ,
you can connect my client to any man in fairview .
well , not every man in fairview ended up
with the defendant &apos;s fingerprint on his shirt ,
but mr. sanchez did .
your honor , the idea that my client
would conduct herself in-- in that manner is absurd .
she is a paragon of virtue in the community ,
a champion of conservative values ...
short recess , your honor ?
bree ...
bree , is this true ? did you sleep with ramon sanchez ?
no .
but the other men ?
how the hell could you not tell me this ?
oh , all right , okay . this ...
this is okay as long as we can stay in front of it .
um ... i need to know exactly who you slept with and when--
are you kidding me ? no .
bree , if i &apos;m going to defend you ,
i need to know the truth .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t talk about this with you .
gaby ?
doris , you won &apos;t believe what just got off the plane .
the most beautifully embroidered chinese silk ,
and if you listen to it carefully ,
you can hear little children asking , &quot; when &apos;s dinner ? &quot;
oh , i &apos;m gonna have to stop you right there .
okay , a little insensitive . my bad .
no , i @-@ i &apos;ve had a change of heart ,
and i can &apos;t buy anything more from you .
in fact , i need to return these .
what ? you can &apos;t . i work on commission .
i @-@ i mean , you love these clothes .
did you know that one of these scarves
could buy a month of vocational training
for a homeless addict ?
no , but that sounds awfully familiar .
it was in the pamphlet that carlos slipped me last night .
he did what now ?
and we talked on the phone this morning ,
and he reminded me of what my husband used to say--
that &quot; those who do well must also do good . &quot;
that sounds like carlos .
he &apos;s a very special guy .
hold on to him .
well , now that you mention it ,
i can &apos;t wait to get my hands on him .
do you have any idea how much commission
i stood to make from this lady ?
gaby .
doris was my golden goose . i was fattening her up ,
and then you went and stole all her eggs ,
and--and , well , i don &apos;t know where this metaphor is going ,
but i am mad at you , mister .
gaby .
no , stop &quot; gaby &quot; -ing me . i will not be &quot; gaby &quot; -ed .
look , where doris puts her money is her decision .
tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 , she &apos;s putting it here .
okay . you don &apos;t have to be so smug
just &apos; cause you &apos;re &quot; doing charity . &quot;
no quotation marks . i &apos;m actually doing charity ,
helping people get their lives together .
and i &apos;m helping people put their wardrobes together .
potato , potahto .
i got to run to a meeting .
now ? we &apos;re in the middle of an argument .
yeah , but it &apos;s no fun to argue when only one side
is morally defensible .
but you know what it is fun ?
a little victory dance .
okay , it took me all night ,
and i scraped off two of my knuckles ,
and i drank so much green tea
that one of my eyes won &apos;t stop twitching ,
but ... it &apos;s ... finished .
okay . before you say anything ,
i designed the flame decals myself ,
so if you don &apos;t like them , they &apos;re totally removable .
but personally , i like them . i think they &apos;re awesome .
and there &apos;s a basket on the back for sundries or snacks
or thumb tacks to throw under the competition &apos;s tires .
but why would you need to cheat with a car like this , right ?
are you gonna say something ?
oh , i get it .
you hate the basket . guess what .
basket gone .
oh , come on . i &apos;ve been doing this for two days straight .
you gotta give me something .
i ... love it .
you do ?
hee hee ! i mean , of course you do .
but seriously , if you have any thoughts or tweaks , tell me .
&apos;cause we still have a day before the race .
no , no , it &apos;s perfect .
oh , i &apos;m so relieved .
you wanna take it for a spin ?
yeah , but ... i &apos;m kind of thirsty .
can you get me something to drink ?
of course . two frosty non @-@ caffeinated root beers
coming right up .
oh , my god ! what did you do ?
i didn &apos;t see it coming . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , not you ! my son ! you can go .
m.j. , did you wreck the car on purpose ?
no . it just rolled down the driveway .
it &apos;s a flat driveway .
okay , i did it .
why ?
i hate that car .
well , then we &apos;ll change it .
we &apos;ll make it whatever you want to .
i don &apos;t wanna do it . i don &apos;t wanna be the weirdo .
honey , did someone call you a weirdo ?
they don &apos;t have to . they &apos;re always staring at me
and treating me different &apos; cause i don &apos;t have a dad .
oh , honey .
and if i go to the father @-@ son derby ,
and i &apos;m the only kid with his mom ,
it &apos;s gonna be even worse .
i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea .
what can i do to make it better ?
nothing . i just want dad .
how was soccer ?
awesome . i think we &apos;re gonna
kick san marino &apos;s ass on saturday .
nice . you want me to make you something to eat ?
thanks . i &apos;m gonna get changed .
it &apos;s cute how her generation thinks that sport is interesting .
oh , and , um , i will bring her to the game saturday .
looks like we won &apos;t need to switch weekends .
i thought you and jane were going away .
can &apos;t . i got to work .
gregg wants me to rework the strategic plan
the international guys did , so ...
huh . well , that sucks .
never liked that guy .
then why &apos;d you go out with him ?
i mean , he said you guys had drinks the other night ?
it was nothing . we just , you know ...
hung out for a bit .
you do realize that that could be awkward for me .
huh . that &apos;s weird .
what ?
i have an &quot; isn &apos;t that ironic &quot; app
that usually buzzes when people say stuff like that .
i &apos;m serious , lynette . that &apos;s where i work .
it was just drinks with a guy i know ,
who happens to be your boss .
i promise not to do anything embarrassing
like ... kissing in the office .
okay . you know what ? you wanna see gregg ?
it &apos;s fine with me .
how about if instead of eating this sandwich ,
i just wanted to eat chocolate ?
hey . how about ... &quot; no &quot; ?
but what if i told you something about dad and jane
that would make you very happy ?
then could i ?
why , you little finagler .
how do i know your information is even worth
the fine belgian chocolates that i have hidden in the pantry ?
oh , it is .
oh . it would be wrong to teach you that this kind of blackmail works .
besides , i can see
you &apos;re just bursting to tell me anyway .
when dad told jane he had to work this weekend ,
she kind of lost it .
really ? the chocolate that i am in no way trading
for this information has almonds in it .
she was all , &quot; we never have time together &quot;
and &quot; you still haven &apos;t filed the divorce papers . &quot;
is that true ? he hasn &apos;t ?
the envelope is still sitting on a shelf in the kitchen .
put the sandwich down ,
or you won &apos;t have any room left for chocolate .
well , look who strolled in from the outback .
where the hell have you been ?
sorry . i really needed to sort through some stuff .
stuff ? you mean what hors d &apos;oeuvres
we &apos;ll be serving at the wedding ,
or are you referring to the dead body ?
hey , if you plan on staying , you &apos;d better start talking .
i am impossibly in love with you , renee .
and there &apos;s nothing i want more than to come clean .
but if i tell you what &apos;s going on ,
you could get dragged into this ,
and then you &apos;re at risk , too .
you have to trust me .
your ex kept secrets to hurt you .
i &apos;m keeping them to protect you .
okay .
really ? that was easy .
well , while you were on your walkabout ,
i remembered something .
spousal privilege .
which is ?
it &apos;s a crazy law we have here .
you don &apos;t have to testify against your husband .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
we say &quot; i do , &quot; we walk back up the aisle ,
the second we &apos;re outside that church ,
you tell me everything .
and if i don &apos;t ?
well , then i guess you won &apos;t be seeing
those wedding night moves i told you about .
and trust me ...
my secret is way better than yours .
so you are alive .
you &apos;re just not answering your phone .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
can &apos;t imagine what you must think of me
after hearing all that .
bree , listen , i don &apos;t judge people .
i defend them .
and if i &apos;m gonna defend you , i need to know everything .
sexual history from your first husband
down to the last guy on the d.a. &apos; s witness list .
how about i go in the kitchen and say it ,
and you just ... listen from out here ?
no dice . i need you to say it to my face .
why ?
because you &apos;re gonna be sitting at the defendant &apos;s table
while one guy after another takes the stand
and goes into as much graphic detail
as the prosecutor wants him to ,
and the whole time the jury is gonna be looking at your face .
oh , dear god .
and if the look on your face is guilt ,
they &apos;re gonna think you &apos;re guilty .
so i need you to own this part of your life ,
and that starts with you telling me everything .
okay .
i hoped it wouldn &apos;t come to this , but , uh ,
maybe it would be helpful if i told you
my sexual secrets first .
no , it most certainly would not be helpful .
besides , men aren &apos;t embarrassed
about their conquests .
i am gonna start talking now .
first time i had sex ...
i was 24 .
i was in law school .
she was a classmate and rather experienced .
it didn &apos;t go very well ,
or for that matter , last very long .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s hilarious .
in fact , every christmas ,
i get a card from her
that says , &quot; still laughing . &quot;
so you had an awkward first experience .
who didn &apos;t ?
you want worse ? i @-@ i can do worse .
okay .
i don &apos;t know how to say this . um ...
i am ... quite oversized down there .
since when is a man being well endowed
considered humiliating ?
i &apos;m talking about my prostate--
my enlarged prostate .
best part-- your doctor tells you
it only happens to older men .
that &apos;s the reason you have to pee 30 times a day .
so now you know i &apos;m pushing 50 , borderline incontinent ,
and women are scared of my junk .
is that humiliating enough for you ?
yes , i think it is .
glad to hear it .
i have to tell you now , don &apos;t i ?
i was in a dark place ...
lonely ...
and in pain , i started ...
drinking ... again .
so the kicker to the story is ,
the new international plan that tom came up with is--
is pretty awesome .
he may not have good taste in women ,
but he is damn smart about finance .
tom is really smart ...
in that one area .
poor jane .
you &apos;re really enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
a little , tiny bit .
you should .
i wish i had a way of getting back
at crystal when we were breaking up .
must feel good .
jane was pretty pissed , huh ?
oh , apparently .
so even though that makes me a terrible person ,
thank you for that .
anytime . i mean that .
anytime .
so ...
if i asked you to have tom work a few nights this week ,
you &apos;d do it ?
if i could help you piss off your ex
and spend more time with you , i see no downside in that .
you just say the word .
really ?
late nights , weekends .
maybe even a few out @-@ of @-@ town trips ?
you tell me what you want ,
i &apos;ll make it happen .
must be why women fall for powerful men .
and then the prosecutor suggested
i was probably so drunk , that i forgot the whole thing .
well , hang on . didn &apos;t your hotshot lawyer
get all up in her face with the &quot; objections &quot;
and the &quot; sidebars &quot;
and the &quot; you can &apos;t handle the truth ! &quot; ?
trip was amazing ,
but she still said it was admissible .
my entire sordid past is admissible .
so just because you slept with a few guys
means you slept with alejandro ?
more than a few .
sorry . carry on .
you know what the worst thing was ?
the look on trip &apos;s face . he was so disappointed in me .
wait . that was the worst thing ?
worse than the whole sharing @-@ a @-@ cell @-@ for @-@ 20 @-@ years- with @-@ a @-@ big @-@ gal @-@ named @-@ vern thing ?
well , i &apos;m not going to prison .
i mean , trip says we &apos;re gonna win ,
and i believe in him .
i just thank god that even after all of this ,
he still believes in me .
okay , i &apos;m gonna say it .
bree , you have a crush on your lawyer .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
you do sound a teensy bit smitten .
i am not smitten . i @-@ i happen to admire his legal skills , and--
his dreamy blue eyes ?
they &apos;re not blue . they &apos;re green , flecked with hints of brown .
okay , maybe i find him attractive ,
but do you really think i would put myself at risk
by dating my own attorney ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
you put us all at risk when you dated chuck .
look , having a crush is nothing to be ashamed of .
he &apos;s rescuing you , and it &apos;s in our d.n.a.
to fall for guys who rescue us .
but in this case , it &apos;s just not safe for you to act on it .
i guess you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re on trial for murder , bree .
you got to keep a clear head .
and so does he .
doris , i just want you to know how grateful we are .
your donation is gonna help so many recovering addicts
get back on their feet .
oh , stop . i should be thanking you
for letting me be a part of all this .
and please forgive the appearance of my office .
every penny that we get goes directly to those in need ,
so there &apos;s not a lot left over for ...
nice ... things .
those in need , huh ?
this is not my stuff !
i had a simple wooden desk , an old coffee table .
oh .
and a baby grand .
well , that must come in handy
while you &apos;re all singing &quot; kumbaya &quot;
during your clean needle exchange .
doris , please .
this is not what we &apos;re about here .
find yourself another old lady to fleece .
honey , i need to show you something in the garage .
did you fix the car ?
no . juanita used the wood to build a coffin for the squirrel ,
but i do have a little surprise for you .
oh , hey , perfect timing , m.j.
we could really use another pair of hands .
what are they doing here ?
well , i know i told you that i could do this myself ,
but i got to thinking that every race car driver
has a pit crew , and this is yours .
we &apos;re here to help you .
and not just about car stuff , you know ?
anytime you need something , give us a call .
so what do you think of this design ? hey ?
it ... kind of looks like a corvette .
kind of ? it &apos;s an exact rendering .
look at the shading on the wheel well .
calm down . you traced it out of a magazine .
can you guys really build this ?
um , well ... not without your help .
so what do you think about color ?
red or blue ?
mom ? what do you think ?
i think , uh ... this is kind of a guy thing ,
and i should let you guys get to work .
my dad loved corvettes .
we know .
he always said if he ever won the lottery ,
first thing he &apos;d do is buy a corvette stingray convertible .
come on in .
whoa . you look like a million bucks .
aw . and trust me , i know what a million bucks looks like .
what a lovely compliment ...
for one of us .
so , uh , gallo is the best restaurant in town ,
and after tonight , you will know why .
well , can &apos;t wait .
let &apos;s go .
but first ... i have a gift for you .
a nail .
how thoughtful ...
and ... imaginary .
a nail in the coffin of tom &apos;s happiness .
the end of tom and jane .
completely baffled .
every time this week i told him i needed him late ,
tom would go in his office ,
and i &apos;d hear him on the phone in a big fight with jane .
you shouldn &apos;t be telling me this .
but ... yay !
so how do you think the persnickety ms. carlson
will handle the news of tom &apos;s transfer ?
his what ?
the international plan needs a point man ,
so i &apos;m sending tom to mumbai for a year .
m @-@ mumbai like ... india mumbai ?
which means you and i will have fairview
all to ourselves .
we got to go .
lynette ?
car . huh ?
i can &apos;t believe you did that to my office .
i had a butler lined up ,
but he booked a commercial at the last minute .
so i guess i &apos;ll call doris now and make an appointment
for shopping tomorrow .
yeah , i don &apos;t think she &apos;ll be answering either of our calls .
she thinks we &apos;re both nuts , so thanks a lot , gaby .
you started it . you &apos;re the one who stole her from me
in the first place .
yeah , for something that matters .
oh , enough with the carlos of nazareth act .
this wasn &apos;t about helping people .
this was about you smelling money
and going after it .
the money was for the center . those people need it .
the center ? please . you were doing it to win .
and you know why ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re a shark , carlos .
you always have been , and you always will be .
it &apos;s your nature .
honey .
it &apos;s okay . i am , too .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re good together .
look , i may not like that you stole doris from me ,
but i do like that you &apos;re the type of guy who can .
it &apos;s sexy .
but ...
that &apos;s not who i want to be anymore .
well , who do you want to be ?
somebody different .
well , i hate to tell you this , babe ,
but the best you can hope to be
is just a different kind of shark .
yes , it isn &apos;t easy giving up power ...
admitting that we might need help
from friends and neighbors ...
deciding that a loved one ...
might know what &apos;s best for us .
giving up our better judgment
for a slightly darker agenda .
but for some ,
the hardest kind of power to give up ...
is the power to control their own desires .
hello . you wanted to see me ?
did you , uh , have some new thoughts on the case ?
lots , but why don &apos;t we discuss them over dinner ?
dinner . um , can &apos;t we talk here ?
no , i &apos;ve been cooped up all day ,
and i know this great , little italian place .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
oh , come on . i &apos;m a much better lawyer
after a plate of spaghetti carbonara .
so ? what do you say ?
i say ...
