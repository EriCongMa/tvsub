&quot; the bed &apos;s too big without you &quot;
they found this guy in maine
who had been living completely alone in the woods
for 30 years .
they called him the last true hermit .
30 years without the warmth of human touch .
without conversation .
the hermit felt more lonely when he was out in the world ...
alex ! alex !
than he ever felt in the woods by himself .
surrounded by people but drowning in solitude ...
that kind of loneliness
can swallow you whole .
hey ! i texted you .
yeah , i saw that . i was busy .
well , cristina would &apos;ve responded .
that &apos;s not how it works .
not if she was doing what i was doing .
you pause . that &apos;s the rule .
what ?
if the text is urgent ,
cristina would say to owen , &quot; pause , &quot;
and i would say to derek , &quot; pause , &quot;
then we &apos;d text each other back .
in the middle of sex ?
if the the text is urgent .
the fact you are checking a text while you &apos;re doing it
is already sad .
we had a special ringtone .
hey , you want a special ringtone ?
no . wait , this pause thing ...
like , your legs are in the air
and you &apos;re screaming and ...
pause .
no , i don &apos;t pause . jo doesn &apos;t pause .
she fast @-@ forwards and she rewinds ,
but she doesn &apos;t pause .
okay , that &apos;s gross .
do you wanna scrub in on my i.v.c. sarcoma ?
is it a kid ?
no .
then no . why ?
because i want some company .
get a resident .
i have a resident . i want a grownup .
bye .
cristina would &apos;ve scrubbed in . you &apos;re no good at this .
bailey !
you wanna scrub in on my i.v.c. sarcoma ?
well , you don &apos;t need me for that . don &apos;t you have a resident ?
residents are boring . all they wanna do is learn .
come on . it &apos;s gonna be good .
it &apos;s all over the liver , hepatic vein .
it &apos;s gonna be bloody and gross .
does look like fun .
page me when you &apos;re ready . see you in the o.r.
adrian nelson , 51 . presents with abdominal pain .
scans show a leiomyosarcoma
behind the liver , including the i.v.c.
what &apos;s the surgical plan ?
laparotomy to isolate the vessel ,
resect the tumor , and then replace with a graft .
it &apos;s a pretty straightforward procedure , adrian .
i don &apos;t foresee any problem .
could i ask you to ...
i @-@ it &apos;s silly . never mind .
what is it ?
she wants you to -- to swear on the book .
&quot; the odyssey . &quot;
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s the first book i ever sold adrian .
the day we met .
michael &apos;s a rare book vendor .
our hands touched when i was ringing her up ...
and it was ... it was such a high .
it was electric .
we were both too shy to ask for a date .
so i wrote my number on a bookmark .
i saw it as soon as i got home , and then i called .
we &apos;ve been together ever since .
this book , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s our wedding ring .
could you swear on the book , dr. grey ,
that you &apos;ll do your best ?
it would mean so much .
dr. wilson , too .
sure .
i swear .
so dr. wilson will prep you , and i &apos;ll see you up there .
they &apos;re adorable .
they &apos;re weirdos .
okay , you &apos;re gonna feel a little bit of pressure .
and this will tell us conclusively
if the osteogenesis imperfecta is type ii or iii ?
yes
yeah . it &apos;s probably type iii though , right ?
i mean , so far there &apos;s been no indication of fetal distress .
well , we &apos;ll know soon enough .
it &apos;ll be okay . o.i. type iii , it &apos;s hard , sure ,
when there &apos;s surgeries and challenges , but we &apos;re surgeons .
we can ... we can handle challenges , right ?
i mean , we &apos;ll --
we &apos;ll still be able to give our baby a wonderful life .
right ?
many type iii babies live very , very happy lives .
shouldn &apos;t dr. herman be doing this ?
mm , it &apos;s very routine procedure .
dr. herman is the big gun .
we only fire the big gun when we need the big gun .
i &apos;m the little gun , so ...
let the little gun work .
thank you so much . i know that took up a lot of your time .
i just wanna get all of the views
with the thinnest cross sections i can get .
and i find that adorable .
you really think you can pull off your plan , huh ?
i &apos;ve got all your past medical records .
once i get a firm grasp
on the roads your other surgeons took to get to &quot; no , &quot;
i can cut away a clear path to &quot; yes . &quot;
by the time i &apos;m done with your tumor ,
i &apos;m gonna be able to tell you
what street this bastard grew up on
and where it lost its virginity .
well , you certainly are confident .
thank you .
or delusional .
one of the two .
it &apos;s hard to tell . they look similar .
so i think we need to talk about what we &apos;ll decide
if it turns out the baby &apos;s type iii .
i already told you , he won &apos;t be .
yeah , i know that &apos;s what you believe . so do i , obviously .
but if he is type ii , then it &apos;s so terrible ...
i know .
and fatal ...
usually .
all right ? and before that , it &apos;s even worse .
i @-@ i know all of this . i just -- i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
but we should talk about it . we need to talk about it .
w @-@ why ? why can &apos;t we just wait until tomorrow ?
because we should have a plan . what do you mean ?
okay , well , uh , what do you wanna do ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . i think we should decide .
no , no . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m asking what you want .
i want for us to figure this out together .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i think that you already know what you would wanna do .
so ...
what ?
just -- yeah , just say it out loud .
don &apos;t ...
right now . well , what do you wanna do ?
if our baby is type ii , i ...
i think we should terminate .
and i don &apos;t care whether our baby is type ii or type iii .
either way , i wanna keep him .
wh - -april .
i told you i didn &apos;t wanna talk about this .
look at all these adhesions .
no way to see &apos; em coming .
sneaky little bastards won &apos;t show up on the scan .
and there &apos;s more of them posteriorly , too .
i need some more exposure .
you &apos;re thinking of extending the incision ?
i have to . i can &apos;t see what &apos;s up in there .
this tumor just keeps coming .
and all the landmarks are obscured .
i &apos;m lost in here . it &apos;s like going blind .
hey , uh , would you bring those scans closer , please ?
yes , doctor .
see , the tumor should be in the suprahepatic i.v.c. only .
that can &apos;t be right .
it doesn &apos;t show any further local invasion .
show me the coronal view ?
what &apos;s the tumor doing all the way over there ?
that &apos;s what i want to know .
how old are these scans ?
they &apos;re only two weeks old .
and they &apos;re completely outdated .
i mean , this thing is growing too fast .
nothing is where it &apos;s supposed to be .
tumor has extended to the i.v.c. tributaries .
yeah , these scans are useless .
i can &apos;t see what i &apos;m doing .
oh , god . it &apos;s also spreading through the diaphragm . suction .
i can &apos;t even see where ...
neither can i.
don &apos;t touch that . it &apos;s tearing .
well , the tumor &apos;s extended all the way up between the lungs .
someone page cardio !
it &apos;s all the way up into the pericardium .
get the suction out . don &apos;t touch it . don &apos;t do anything .
page -- page cardio 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
we gotta get out . everybody out . hands off .
what are we doing ? what &apos;s going on ?
can someone say something ? what are we doing ?
it &apos;s spread from her major blood vessels to her liver ,
diaphragm , pericardium , and maybe even her heart .
how can one tumor grow this big this fast ?
it is everywhere .
it &apos;s a monster .
so what do we do ?
i have no idea .
michael , i &apos;m afraid adrian &apos;s tumor
has grown considerably
and it &apos;s now reaching around her heart .
so dr. pierce is here .
her -- her h @-@ heart ?
it &apos;s entangled through the vein that stretches up
from her liver to her heart .
and it &apos;s growing more rapidly than anticipated .
so we need to take her for more m.r.i.s
so we can see how extensive the tumor &apos;s growth is .
now there &apos;s all of you .
three doctors .
three is a lot .
look , um , odysseus didn &apos;t return to ithaca all by himself .
he needed a lot of help , right , from the phaeacians ?
well , we &apos;re the phaeacians .
you want all the phaeacians you can get .
we are going to figure this tumor out .
so light .
and it &apos;s last year &apos;s model .
we &apos;re weeks away from unveiling one that will weigh 30 % less .
mm . wow . very impressive .
your project is impressive .
robotic limbs for injured vets ?
sexy as hell .
and we at cybersystems are dying to climb into bed with you .
well , that &apos;s very flattering .
mm @-@ hmm . good . i want it to be .
i &apos;ll leave you this folder
so you can go over the materials .
i &apos;ll be in seattle another day ,
so please , call me if you need ... anything .
thank you . thank you for coming in .
so ... what do you think ?
i think you should definitely go for it .
really ?
&apos;cause i was not that impressed with these transducers .
what ? no .
no , those -- those things are crap .
i &apos;m talking about her .
her vibes ? you didn &apos;t feel her vibes ?
major vibage for major hunt .
you read that totally wrong .
oh , please .
&quot; your project &apos;s sexy as hell .
ooh , ooh , let &apos;s climb into bed . &quot;
i was actually uncomfortable .
stop it !
there you are . where have you been ?
i was performing a c.v.s. on april kepner .
we &apos;re just waiting for the results .
god , i hate waiting .
in peds , it is -- it &apos;s much easier .
you know , the parents are right there .
and -- and you talk to them ,
and then their kid is right there ,
so they can hold them close
and hope for the best .
the cat &apos;s on the roof .
with this , there &apos;s no kid to hold .
the problem feels so theoretical .
you know , there &apos;s no cat , there &apos;s no roof .
there &apos;s just two scared parents feeling totally helpless .
and you &apos;ve had the results rushed ?
yeah . i should get them in , like , 24 hours .
well , then there &apos;s nothing more to do about it today ,
which is good .
i have been working miracles .
i have found us the most incredible surgeries ,
all for the next few weeks .
look , a t.t.t.s. in a 19 @-@ weeker .
a 21 @-@ week t.r.a.p. sequence that needs an r.f.a.
a unilateral pulmonary agenesis .
and that is just the beginning .
the beginning of what ?
your crash course .
i have hunted down the most screwed up ,
medically compromised fetuses that i could find ,
and i &apos;m bringing them all here to this hospital
for you to learn and us to save .
and you &apos;ll get to fix them all ?
we will .
start reading .
you can thank me later .
... and then -- and this sounds crazy ,
i know , so don &apos;t even --
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll build in a distribution
of a radioactive seed during surgery ,
keeping dr. herman &apos;s tumor bed free of recurring cells .
i thought you were gonna use a laser .
i am . i already did . we &apos;re way past that .
try and keep up .
uh , i &apos;m sorry , shepherd , but this is a great opportunity
for them to learn .
i know . it &apos;s fine .
the laser is for ablating cells off the optic nerve --
it &apos;s a massive butterfly glioma .
well , it &apos;s not just massive . i mean ...
it &apos;s magnificent .
no , no , no .
i @-@ i mean that , won &apos;t a laser take months ?
a @-@ again , uh , before that , i &apos;ll be using
the ultrasonic surgical aspirator
to mush and flush the cells ,
then the sexy laser and the -- yeah .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just lost .
um , you were just talking about laser ablation .
so is that confined to the optic chiasm
or will that extend -- - guys , step back .
look at the whole big , beautiful , shapely thing .
every part of this tumor &apos;s body will respond differently .
you will need a multitude of approaches .
you will have to be gentle with one part
and rough with the other .
that is the only way she will respond .
get it ?
i don &apos;t see tumors the way she does .
didn &apos;t five surgeons say
any one of these approaches
would likely kill the patient ?
six .
but none of them tried it all at the same time .
it should work .
maybe we should start over again from the beginning .
okay .
i will begin with a , uh , bifrontal approach .
i @-@ is that the right atrium ? i can &apos;t tell .
everything looks like mush .
well , look at this angle right here .
is that invading the right atrium ?
i think that &apos;s a motion artifact .
crap .
adrian &apos;s back in her room .
stable for now . how we doing here ?
has the cyclops revealed himself ?
the cyclops ?
well , the patient &apos;s a fan of &quot; the odyssey , &quot;
so i &apos;m calling the tumor the cyclops
&apos;cause it &apos;s a big , ugly monster .
and i feel like i &apos;m working with one eye
because i can see it , but i can &apos;t get a sense
of the whole thing .
every view is incomplete .
okay , what if we get a new set of scans , with contrast ,
this time with 3 @-@ d reconstruction ?
well , the woman &apos;s lying open in her bed .
we don &apos;t have time for a lot of trial and error .
i just wanna reach in and grab it .
well , we could go in with these ,
but , yeah , i can &apos;t see .
if i could just hold it in my hand
so that i could see it ...
holy crap .
what ?
she &apos;s having an idea .
i already had it last year , and it &apos;s brilliant .
we are going to print it .
the whole tumor .
i tried it with the portal veins ,
but it &apos;s not working .
but with this , we don &apos;t need it to function .
she &apos;s got a functioning tumor .
we just need to be able to see it
so we know how to kill it .
know your enemy .
is this gonna work ?
it &apos;ll work .
ooh , 2 % left to upload .
this is how we beat this thing .
this is how we get visualization .
we are going to have a tangible , anatomically correct
3 @-@ d model of this exact tumor ,
and correlate to the adjacent organs --
done ! loaded !
in 10 hours .
the longest documented surviving type ii case
that i could find lived for all of 18 months .
in an i.c.u. his entire life ,
hooked up to a feeding tubes and a ventilator .
that &apos;s not a life .
that &apos;s not a life i want for my son .
i -- of c-- neither do i. i ...
okay . so then how can you --
because we don &apos;t know what will happen .
we don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s type ii .
okay , but what if he is ?
any amount of time that he survives ...
any amount of time that he lives will be --
will be with us ,
in our arms ...
yes .
knowing that he &apos;s loved and wanted .
and his bones can break if you touch him .
his bones can break if we &apos;re changing his diaper .
we &apos;re doctors . we can handle it .
if -- if anyone can handle it , we can .
i &apos;m not saying we can &apos;t handle it .
i &apos;m asking if we should .
yeah , we &apos;re doctors .
maybe we are better equipped to make an educated decision here .
and maybe we were given this baby for a reason .
april .
you called your mom .
yeah . people need their mom in a crisis .
no , not everybody does .
i came as soon as i got your call , sweetie .
it &apos;s okay . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m here .
are you working today ?
no .
then let &apos;s get out of here .
you could use a change of scenery .
that &apos;s actually a really good idea .
we should take the day ,
go somewhere nice , maybe drive to the ocean .
let &apos;s go to church .
you &apos;ll find comfort there .
yeah , go ahead .
let &apos;s go pray .
she is doing fine .
those chairs will kill your back .
you should go home and get some rest .
i @-@ i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i can &apos;t go home alone when she &apos;s like this .
thought i &apos;d just stay and read .
okay . that &apos;s fine .
but i can &apos;t read either .
can &apos;t concentrate .
it &apos;s odd . i @-@ i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve never had that problem .
i think it &apos;s because ...
i don &apos;t know where she is .
i @-@ i always know where she is .
well , she &apos;s right here .
it &apos;s just as if she &apos;s asleep in the bed next to you .
not really .
because she might not wake up .
i feel like ...
like she &apos;s sailed away
and i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s coming back .
that &apos;s the feeling , you know ?
michael , we are working very hard to solve this .
i know .
i know . i just ...
i just want her to come back .
i do , too .
this h.l.h.s. case seems impossible .
mother &apos;s pregnant for the third time ,
and each baby was stillborn .
well , this one will be , too .
22q11 deletion ?
she should adopt .
now this one , however --
tracheal balloon occlusion for c.d.h. ?
card that puppy .
how do you do this without --
i mean , these stories are awful .
they &apos;re patients , robbins .
the more you find , the more you learn ,
the more we save .
it &apos;s as simple as that .
your work is making these three categories --
possible , impossible , maybe .
any other approach is a waste of our time .
holy crap .
it &apos;s fate !
look ! it &apos;s your sexy tech rep !
your sexy tech rep !
she -- she &apos;s not my sexy anything .
not yet , but she could be .
i came out tonight with you to -- to unwind ,
not to ...
and she &apos;s a -- she &apos;s a tech rep .
that &apos;s a conflict of interest .
not if we don &apos;t buy her transducers .
they &apos;re junk , anyway .
come on ! you gotta get back in the saddle .
and she &apos;s got a nice saddle .
oh , yeah .
what ? whoa . whoa . what are you doing ?
okay , so listen ,
i &apos;m not , uh , really great at this kind of thing ,
so i &apos;m just gonna blurt it out .
i think that you were interested
in more than just our program today .
oh , you picked up on that ?
i was right ! ha ha ha !
i knew it ! okay . so this should be easy .
owen is a little bit shy , but he &apos;s a great guy .
and , uh ... the feeling &apos;s mutual .
so ...
so what do you say ?
i would say that there &apos;s something about him
that doesn &apos;t quite ... feel like he &apos;s my type .
what ? ! no ! he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s very attractive . he &apos;s nice . he &apos;s funny .
people like funny , right ?
i mean , come on . give him a chance .
what about him isn &apos;t your type ?
he has a penis .
ohh .
oh .
wait . no . you were ...
you -- you were flirty .
i was ,
but not with him .
oh .
um ...
wow .
i am wildly saddened by my , uh , intense ...
lack of game right now .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t see that coming .
i -- there was a time when i would &apos;ve been all ,
&quot; that &apos;s right . i know it &apos;s me . &quot;
but right now , i &apos;m just like , uh ,
&quot; uh ... &quot;
&apos;cause , uh , you looking at me like that ...
you are gorgeous , by the way . uh ...
do people just tell you that all the time ?
because you are gorgeous .
i &apos;m not .
am i ?
no .
am i ?
no . wait . no , no . wait , wait . stop . stop , stop , stop , stop .
not into women ?
no , no , no . i am , totally .
women . men . people , really .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m just not really shopping right now .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m divorced .
and it &apos;s ... was recent and painful
and brutal .
brutal , actually .
well , if you wanna forget for just a little while ,
i fly out tomorrow .
doesn &apos;t have to be anything more than one night .
i would love ...
i would love to love that . i &apos;m just not ready .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
w--
hi , guys .
hey .
you &apos;re here late .
well , we &apos;re on a timeline .
i , uh , was taking a look at dr. wall &apos;s notes ,
and i found some contradictory information .
he was the second opinion ?
wall is where ?
case western .
uh , he was third .
mm . he &apos;s radiation .
right . just getting my dates straight .
what are all these ?
cases . fetuses .
each card represents a fetus
that i &apos;m gonna teach robbins how to fix .
that i ... estimate we can get to in the time i have .
and those ?
uh , these ?
no . these are the ones that i could save ,
uh , if i had time .
you should just think of them as babies who will die
if it turns out that you &apos;re full of crap
and can &apos;t take out my tumor .
ah . no pressure .
oh , no . pressure .
we &apos;re -- we &apos;re on a timeline here , right ?
try being me .
okay .
dr. meadows , labor and delivery .
dr. meadows , labor and delivery .
oh , good ! you &apos;re home !
just in time for dinner .
smells good .
how was church ?
the choir was there ,
practicing for their service tomorrow night .
really beautiful . we should all go to it .
ah , i don &apos;t think
we &apos;ll know what we &apos;ll be up for tomorrow , karen .
because of the test results ?
april told me about the test , and i told her
there &apos;s really no point in even getting those results .
excuse me ?
god gives what he wants to give .
no test is going to change that .
and april &apos;s already so upset , so stressed .
it &apos;s not good for the baby .
just focus on loving that sweet little baby .
that &apos;s all that matters .
no , that &apos;s definitely not all that matters .
i know . it &apos;s hard to understand sometimes
how his plan will unfold .
yeah , but i &apos;m not worried about his plan , am i ?
i &apos;m worried about our plan .
he never gives us more than we can handle .
getting the results ,
being informed about our baby &apos;s condition --
that &apos;s how we handle it .
i called our pastor at home .
april spoke to him at length . he was very helpful .
april .
me . let me help you .
whatever happens , we will shoulder the burden
when it is placed upon us .
we will .
you and i. we &apos;ll shoulder the burden .
she &apos;s just trying to help .
is she , though ? really ? is she helping ?
don &apos;t snap at her .
don &apos;t talk to her in that tone .
what tone ?
i &apos;m not talking using a tone . i &apos;m trying to understand .
you &apos;re trying to talk my little girl
into doing something she knows in her heart and soul
she does not want to do .
i &apos;m not trying to talk her into anything .
i &apos;m supporting her in trying to make the best choice possible
for our baby , for her , for our family .
this is between april and her god .
okay .
and if you think she is going to agree
to abort her child ...
our child !
you are -- - get that straight . it &apos;s our child .
stop it ! stop it ! stop it ! stop it !
none of this is helping !
you are not helping , neither of you .
i am standing here ,
listening to you tell me that god only gives me one choice ,
and you telling me that i should forgo god &apos;s choice .
and the truth is , i don &apos;t know anything
expect that i am scared and sad and i &apos;m alone .
you &apos;re both just standing there ,
yelling at each other and talking at me ,
but i am alone , and it is terrifying !
and the louder you get , the more terrified i become ,
so i just need you both to just shut up !
can you ... can you do that ?
can you please -- can you please both just shut up ?
what are you guys still doing here ?
we &apos;re solving a tumor by 3 @-@ d printing it .
yeah .
what are you still doing here ?
also solving a tumor .
maybe you should 3 @-@ d print your tumor .
visibility is not my problem .
i can see my tumor in all its problematic glory ,
and it &apos;s giving me the middle finger
in front of richard webber and a bunch of residents .
where are the kids ?
upstairs .
daycare . nightcare . whatever care .
it &apos;s open 24 hours .
you know that &apos;s only for surgeons on call , right ?
bailey , don &apos;t judge me . derek lives in d.c.
no , i &apos;m saying if they ask you ,
make up something about being on call .
when i had my genome lab , i was on call twice a week .
you all realize that printing this thing
is gonna take , like , five more hours ?
7 @-@ ish .
7 hours and 20 minutes .
7 and a half .
i &apos;m just saying you could go home , sleep , and then come back .
someone has to stay in case the printer crashes .
plus , i don &apos;t mind . i like the sound .
it &apos;s kinda soothing .
it feels weird to sleep alone .
i &apos;m not used to it . i don &apos;t know why .
he used to go away all the time ,
but this time , he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s gone ,
and i know he &apos;s gone .
and the bed feels lonely .
it &apos;s like i don &apos;t know how to sleep alone .
you don &apos;t .
i mean , before three months ago , any time i called your house
or came over or skyped or whatever ,
cristina was there .
there &apos;s no way you ever slept alone . i mean , you had derek .
and if you didn &apos;t have derek , you had cristina .
i &apos;m guessing if it came down to it ,
you were , like , the middle spoon in the middle of
a very weird spooning situation .
i &apos;ve never met a less alone person
than you used ...
used to be .
i have to learn to sleep alone .
ben snores .
and he sometimes talks in his sleep .
and he &apos;s hot .
like ... a furnace .
like flames shootin &apos; out of him .
he &apos;s lucky i love him .
and he &apos;s a resident and hardly home at night .
or he &apos;d be dead .
? i will be your ...
i miss sleeping with a man in my bed .
you know , facing away from each other ,
barely touching expect for just the arm thrown over your waist .
when i &apos;d wake up at night ,
terrified of ...
me ,
i liked knowing he was there
and i wasn &apos;t by myself .
i cannot sleep with someone lying next to me .
literally cannot .
my one serious guy ? dean .
dean just loved to spoon and snuggle ,
and i would just ... lie there ,
staring up silently ,
counting the seconds until he would fall asleep
and i could sneak off to sleep on the sofa .
and then i &apos;d sneak back into bed
before he woke up in the morning .
yeah , people think that &apos;s a cute story . it &apos;s not a cute story .
that sofa was hard as a rock . i was exhausted .
dean is a really sweet guy .
he &apos;s tall and kind .
civil rights lawyer .
he &apos;s funny .
so when he proposed , i explained to him
about the sleeping .
i said , &quot; you know ,
maybe you could sleep in a room down the hall . &quot;
i wanted to sleep alone .
and what happened ?
well , he is now married
to someone who loves to spoon and snuggle .
and i sleep like a baby every night .
i might be too good at being alone .
? let the light back in
maybe i could ... print a derek .
just for sleeping .
? let the light back in
hey , move your butt .
hello again , cyclops .
it is crazy cool amazing .
it could not be more amazing .
okay , hit me . what &apos;s next ?
i think we can divide the diaphragm
to resect the pericardial component of the tumor .
but carefully .
we &apos;ll need to dissect 2 to 3 centimeters
proximal to the i.v.c. first to control flow .
yep , and then we can clamp
and create the veno @-@ venous bypass flap .
you sure you don &apos;t wanna do a sternotomy ?
now you have something to say ? where were you yesterday ?
you should &apos;ve showed me this .
karev , what &apos;s your point ?
well ... i would do mcginn &apos;s technique
to access the chest with less invasiveness
to avoid diaphragmatic hernia postradiation .
he &apos;s got a point . back to the beginning .
okay , so feel this right here .
okay , that &apos;s ... what ?
like , 5 centimeters superior to the renal vein ?
okay , but stop .
close your eyes
and just feel .
okay .
because all we have to go on is muscle memory .
um , it &apos;s ... 2 fingerbreadths
from the confluence of the hepatic veins .
and then we anastomose the bifurcated graft .
bailey ?
write that up .
you &apos;re their board bitch .
you &apos;re jealous , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
a little .
wilson !
oh , yeah . uh , on it .
okay , my finger is in the foramen of winslow .
bailey , can you feel me ?
yeah , i &apos;m right behind you .
i can feel the edge of the lesser omentum .
i think that gives me enough space
to control the porta hepatis .
yes . yes . i can palpate a good window .
good . that works .
no .
all right , what next ?
there is no next .
the wound @-@ v.a.c. has frank blood .
she &apos;s bleeding . we have to get her up to the o.r.
you need an extra set of hands ?
yes . wilson &apos;s .
take that white board .
bring it up where everyone can see it .
we haven &apos;t even gotten to
the retroperitoneal dissection yet .
we will when we get up there . we &apos;ll figure it out as we go .
you are coming with me .
i &apos;m into the retrohepatic area . more suction .
okay , then you &apos;re on to step two .
step two -- access the pericardial i.v.c.
bailey , a little more retraction ?
okay , i &apos;m at the pericardium .
well , it branches 2 centimeters in either direction ,
so you &apos;re close .
damn it . adhesions here , too .
there &apos;s too much blood . suction !
i need to do a partial resection of the liver ,
but i just can &apos;t see to do it .
same problem up here .
can i get some more suction , please ?
should we control the hepatic veins
and resect part of the liver ?
i &apos;m trying . i think that &apos;s the only way .
but without visibility , i might hit a major vessel .
pierce ?
i can &apos;t see the field .
yeah , i can &apos;t see anything .
crap . they &apos;re drowning .
i &apos;m not sure the model &apos;s gonna help them .
it &apos;s not telling them any more than the scans did .
and they still can &apos;t see enough to --
the model is how they &apos;ll see ,
without adhesions and bleeding in the way .
how the pieces relate to her anatomy .
it &apos;s the big picture .
oh , my god .
i get it .
you &apos;re welcome .
how &apos;s it coming ?
you know , by millimeters .
your notebook @-@ wielding minions got bored
and ditched me for another tumor .
well , i thought you might need this .
are you keeping tabs on me ?
is that what &apos;s happening ?
no . why would you say that ?
because you might be worried about me ,
and that i ...
have decided i can do something that cannot be done
just so that i can prove that i am okay
and that i deserve to be here .
that i &apos;m overreaching .
should i be keeping tabs on you ?
i mean , you saw the look on those residents &apos; faces yesterday .
they think that i am certifiable .
and ... why shouldn &apos;t they ?
why should i think that i can do this ?
why shouldn &apos;t i think that i &apos;m gonna kill this woman
and all those little babies with her ?
you are not doing that . no .
nobody thinks that this can work .
no one understands it .
you were talking way over those residents &apos; heads .
and you think so fast it made my eyes spin .
but you have a plan .
and just because you &apos;re the only one that can see the endgame
doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re wrong .
it just means it &apos;s lonely .
and scary .
you &apos;d be a fool if you weren &apos;t scared .
i &apos;m @-@ a leave you be .
ugh . don &apos;t . then i &apos;ll be alone with this thing .
what you were talking about yesterday ...
the whole big , beautiful body ?
um , i think i get it .
think .
so you do the fluoroscein first .
tell me why .
so you can keep an eye on the pituitary stalk
even though you &apos;re nowhere near it .
because ?
because ...
you want to appreciate the whole thing at once .
right ?
yes .
thank you .
you can go now .
oh , there . got it . just ligated the hepatic veins .
what &apos;s next ?
okay , you just controlled the lower end of the tumor ,
so ...
that &apos;s as far as you got . that &apos;s the last step .
okay , so next we ...
dissect around the diaphragm .
finish my dissection retroperitoneally .
uh , that &apos;s ... two ways to go .
her heart can &apos;t handle all the clamping .
whatever we do , we have to do it now .
you mean cut blind ?
no . wait . jo , bring the cyclops over here .
on it .
bring it over here ,
hold it up , turn it slowly .
okay , so we &apos;re gonna anastomose the graft to the lower end .
and then i &apos;ll start from the upper end , yes .
okay .
find me .
i am at the diaphragm .
6 @-@ o prolene and graft stat .
i &apos;m on top of the right hepatic vein .
this is where we cut , right here .
that &apos;s my finger .
oh . okay .
no , it &apos;s , uh ...
got it .
here . it extends 10cm off where the veins meet .
right ? this is it . this is it right here .
this is where we cut right here .
how much do you trust that thing ?
i &apos;ll let you know in a second . metz .
no excess bleeding .
not any more than before .
your dissection was flawless .
then she &apos;s comin &apos; out .
okay , cyclops , show me that ugly face .
ugh ! so gross and so freaking cool !
oh ! got some bleeders !
beautiful bleeders , right where we can see them .
she was ... really pretty .
the ... woman .
at the bar .
with the nice transducers .
ugh . i &apos;m not ready .
you gotta start sometime .
owen ...
the last woman that i kissed in that bar ,
i ended up marrying .
well , maybe just take the next one home then .
right ?
shut up .
hey , you &apos;re not ready either .
you know , i can &apos;t even imagine it .
it &apos;s sex .
sure , you know ,
i &apos;ve gone out and had one @-@ night stands before .
but ...
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t ...
something real ?
i pulled that icicle out of her chest .
hell , i @-@ i bathed her when she couldn &apos;t bathe herself .
i can &apos;t imagine belonging to anyone like that again .
have we used up all our happy ?
you ever afraid of that , that this is all there is now ?
it &apos;s like i had a certain amount of happy
that was supposed to last my whole life ,
and i &apos;ve used it all up .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
god , i hope not .
the last true hermit was found
and dragged out of hiding and into the world .
most might find his existence sad ,
but the hermit knew something we didn &apos;t .
pause !
no !
oh ! steph &apos;s rocking neuro with girl shepherd .
she got assigned her crazy tumor ! yeah !
who taught you &quot; pause &quot; ?
oh , um , grey told me about it when we were scrubbing out .
great rule . now ...
unpause .
he knew that when it comes down to it ,
even when you &apos;re with someone ...
or in the noisy rush of people ...
it &apos;s just you .
the one you can count on ...
and lean on ...
and depend on .
it has to be you .
is something wrong ?
no .
just ... what are you doing ?
nothing .
nothing . you ?
i &apos;m just lying in bed with my tumor .
aw ! you brought it home .
can i see it ?
and once you figure that out ...
that &apos;s when being alone ...
well ...
it &apos;s no 3 @-@ d husband , but it &apos;s something .
it &apos;ll do for now .
oh , my god . i have to ...
becomes a choice .
um , it &apos;ll be a minute .
okay .
what ?
this is a big guns conversation , isn &apos;t it ?
april , jackson ,
we have your test results .
my baby &apos;s bones are breaking
inside of my belly ?
he &apos;s in pain .
i am so sorry .
what are those other forms ?
these are , um
for the death certificate .
show up
for april .
i &apos;ll just pray for a miracle .
