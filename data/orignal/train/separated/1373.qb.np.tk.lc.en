cheers .
yeah . hear , hear .
nina .
nina ? nina , talk to me .
just stay put , maura .
no , it &apos;s superficial .
the emt &apos;s on the way . let &apos;s make sure .
kent needs my help .
what are we looking at ?
i got this .
no , i &apos;m fine .
it appears to be a through and through
with entry just below the clavicle .
now if the bullet shattered the clavicle , then obviously --
any movement will sever the subclavian artery .
okay , you apply pressure .
i will immobilize her arm in case she regains consciousness .
damn it ! come on .
clear .
‭ clear .
no way .
you go up that ladder , you &apos;re a sitting duck .
if she &apos;s waiting for you behind one of those windows ,
she &apos;s gonna shoot before you ever see her .
what are we supposed to do , let her go ?
no , you &apos;re supposed to not get yourself killed
while we &apos;re chasing her .
come on , jane .
yeah , this is detective frank rizzoli .
i need a 6 @-@ block lockdown ,
door @-@ to @-@ door and rooftop search centering on ridgeway lane ,
between durham and cambridge .
she okay ?
she &apos;s stabilized .
she &apos;s gonna need surgery .
did you find that shooter ?
no .
jane , maura suffered a --
suffered a what ?
ma .
are you okay ?
yeah , i think so .
startled . you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
frankie ?
he &apos;s fine .
go check maura .
yeah , okay .
kent said that you -- you suffered something.what happened ?
i cut my head .
okay , the end of that sentence was not
&quot; maura suffered a cut on the head . &quot;
what happened ?
possible concussion .
i got a possible concussion and i cut my head .
what about the shooter ?
we lost her on the fire escape .
so you got a good look at her ?
no , but it was alice sands .
how do you know ?
because she burnt down my apartment
and she kidnapped maura . what , it &apos;s somebody else ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m trying to build a case .
well , how could it -- - i @-@ i think you could both
benefit from some tactical breathing .
1 , 2 , 3 -- - okay , you need to go to the hospital .
i &apos;m gonna get a uniform to take you there , all right ?
no , no , no , i &apos;m going to the hospital .
i &apos;m gonna check on nina ,
and i will call you if there are any updates . okay ?
okay .
how big a perimeter did you set up ?
six blocks .
look , why don &apos;t you stay here and take care of kiki , okay ?
i &apos;ll call you when i get the investigation moving .
you got a glove ?
thanks .
all right , this is a crime scene .
nobody touches this unless dr. isles says so .
any word from the hospital ?
yeah , nina &apos;s out of surgery . she &apos;s doing fine .
oh , she was lucky .
how so ?
you were the target . if sands had been aiming at her ...
yeah , i &apos;m still here .
you see all the reporters at the front door ?
yeah , i saw &apos; em .
they didn &apos;t see me , though . i took the back entrance .
&quot; wedding bells ring . shooter flees . bpd fails . &quot;
your poetry sucks .
it &apos;s the headlines of one of their stories .
w-- okay , we haven &apos;t failed . we just haven &apos;t succeeded yet .
how many apartments are there left to search ?
not many .
all right , thanks .
well , the driver of the truck was interviewed .
he received an electronic dispatch from ingersoll , ontario ,
telling him to drive the truck from canada
and leave it where we found it .
and he didn &apos;t think that was strange ?
yeah , but he said he &apos;s paid for driving ,
not thinking .
did he actually say that ?
yep .
you ruling him out ?
well , he &apos;s got no criminal record .
the mounties searched his house and his bank records
and didn &apos;t find anything indicating involvement in a drug ring .
and after he dropped off the truck , he went bowling .
so he &apos;s too boring to be involved .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
so how did she get away from us ?
she still might be in one of those apartments .
yeah , but you know she isn &apos;t gonna sit still .
i hate to be the bearer of bad news ,
but i didn &apos;t find anything in the shooter &apos;s truck .
no fingerprints except for the driver &apos;s .
no unusual fibers .
police academy made alice sands a good criminal .
i sent the tape from the box she traveled in to mit .
i &apos;m wondering if trace amounts of dna ...
from her breath might have stuck to the adhesive .
okay .
so they &apos;re ... going to ...
what ?
call an ambulance .
they &apos;re gonna call an amb--
maura !
maura .
i &apos;m fine .
is she fine ?
if you don &apos;t tell her , i &apos;ll have to , and she won &apos;t believe me .
so please , you &apos;d be doing me a favor .
my preliminary examination indicates a concussion .
but it &apos;s unusual for someone to lose consciousness
that long after the injury , so i &apos;m giving her a cat scan .
we &apos;ll re @-@ evaluate after we get those results .
and we &apos;re going to the cat scan now ?
i have an appointment . later .
and ... we can wait because she &apos;s fine ?
well , she needs to rest ,
which means limited physical and mental activity .
code blue , or 3 . code blue , or 3 .
so none of you can answer a direct question ?
what she just said was perfectly clear .
okay . i &apos;m taking you home . thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
i wanna go back to the office .
no .
my cat scan is not scheduled till tomorrow ,
so i &apos;m not just gonna sit around and wait .
i wanna help find alice sands .
and anyway , i &apos;d rather be at bpd where you can keep an eye on me .
if you don &apos;t take it easy , i &apos;m gonna have you arrested .
on what charges ?
failure to listen to me .
clinical stubborn-- i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll think of something .
here &apos;s what we got .
we know alice sands is the sole shareholder
of new brunswick woodworks .
and now we &apos;ve tied new brunswick
to several other companies that are doing cross @-@ border business .
what took so long ?
well , nina was in the middle of working on it
when she went to the wedding .
did we get the info to the canadian drug authorities ?
yeah . and the dea . we &apos;re tightening the noose .
on her businesses . we &apos;re nowhere on finding her .
did they finish the search ?
all six blocks , every room , every rooftop . didn &apos;t find her .
nobody saw her .
she &apos;s not in any of the video we pulled .
she &apos;s vanished .
well , it pisses me off .
i &apos;ll be back in five .
all right .
hi . i @-@ i didn &apos;t wanna come upstairs .
i didn &apos;t know what i &apos;d be getting in the middle of .
how &apos;s mimi ?
she was drunk enough that some of the chaos eluded her .
i &apos;m glad everyone &apos;s okay ... or will be okay .
me , too .
well , at least they &apos;ll remember it .
i @-@ i know . i know you need to go . i just ...
i wanted to see you .
thanks . i &apos;ll call you later .
‭ okay .
there you are .
easy . easy . lie down .
there &apos;s been a lot of poking and prodding and stitching up .
all i remember is the rice .
it wasn &apos;t my rice , i promise .
how you feel ?
like my bruises have bruises .
is everyone else okay ?
yeah . everyone &apos;s okay .
well , the non @-@ cop guests are a little freaked out , but ...
nicole ?
probably wishes i hadn &apos;t invited her .
did we catch alice sands ?
not yet .
what are you working on ?
alice is hiding somewhere .
i &apos;m trying to figure out where and if anyone &apos;s helping her .
okay . what do you know so far ?
all right , so ...
i got a banker and a lawyer who signed off on documents ...
where are you going ?
to that drawer to get a red pen .
i did walk in here under my own power .
yeah , well , that wouldn &apos;t have been my choice ,
and now you &apos;re under my care , so ...
there .
you are not my doctor .
no , i am not your doctor ,
but i am someone who could call detective rizzoli
and tell her you &apos;re not looking very well ,
which would rain down a heap of hellish goodwill upon your head .
can you get that printout for me ?
yep .
why are you printing out an evidence inventory ?
well , i couldn &apos;t find pictures of the alley
from the night of the shooting ,
so i thought i might look through the log
and see if somebody might have mislabeled the files .
but the alley wasn &apos;t part of the crime scene .
i mean , the police locked it down to do a quick search , but ...
we didn &apos;t send a crime scene unit there .
alice is smart .
maybe she just made it seem like
she disappeared into that building .
we need to get a csru team there immediately .
i &apos;m on it .
i got nothing .
then you &apos;re way ahead of me .
people don &apos;t just disappear . they leave trails .
forensic trails , paper trails .
she &apos;s good . yeah , well , she &apos;s not better than us .
not forever , no . but this time , looks like she got away .
we just have to hope she didn &apos;t run too far .
i &apos;m just being honest .
you read maura &apos;s psych profile .
she &apos;s not gonna quit until she &apos;s beat me .
profiles are just educated guesses .
as hard as it is to believe , maura could be wrong .
she &apos;s not wrong .
alice went to canada to try and fool us .
she snuck back to try and surprise us .
this is all part of her plan , and it failed .
so now she &apos;s gotta figure out her next move .
she &apos;s not gonna run ...
because i &apos;m not gonna let her .
detective rizzoli !
all right , as you know ,
our bpd analyst , nina holiday , was shot yesterday .
we do have a suspect . it &apos;s a woman named alice sands .
she &apos;s a convicted drug dealer .
she &apos;s also a police academy dropout .
i have nothing further to add at this time ,
except it &apos;s clear that
she wasn &apos;t good enough to be a part of bpd .
so it &apos;s just a matter of time
before we find her and bring her to justice .
thank you .
so ... stubborn !
you are the best cop i know ,
but sometimes you do the stupidest things !
well , we all have our gifts .
well , why not just put a target on your chest
and walk down the street ? !
i had to draw her out .
you undermined the chain of command
and put yourself in a position to get suspended or fired !
well , that &apos;s better than letting her get away !
oh , you make it so hard for me to defend you !
vince , i don &apos;t want you to get in trouble .
oh , well , it &apos;s a little late for that .
i can &apos;t ...
we can &apos;t let her hurt anybody else .
what ? !
nina and i found something .
nina &apos;s back ?
not exactly .
a @-@ anyway , joe harris , the prison shrink ,
was on the payroll of a consulting firm
that we &apos;ve tied to alice &apos;s companies .
we need to talk to every employee
of that consulting firm .
i &apos;ll take care of that .
you gotta go downtown .
‭ i do ?
yeah . the chief wants to talk to you .
keep me posted , please .
i will ... if i &apos;m allowed to !
how do you do it ?
do what ?
well ...
i tried to make vince feel better ,
but i clearly made him feel worse .
and now i feel bad .
yeah . can &apos;t make them feel better .
i &apos;ve learned after all these years ...
well , i just keep my mouth shut and listen .
well ... it &apos;s not particularly comforting .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;ll get the hang of it .
yeah .
how &apos;s ron doing ?
well , he was , uh , calm doctor guy at the scene
until his daughter called .
she &apos;d seen him on the news .
that couldn &apos;t have been good .
probably not .
i mean , it &apos;s one thing for me to deal with it ,
maybe an okay choice for him .
but how far can it trickle down
until the effects of this job aren &apos;t okay ?
so how &apos;s the honeymoon going ?
what are you doing ?
hoping i didn &apos;t miss something .
this ? not &quot; taking it easy . &quot;
well , i &apos;ve never done so little work at the office .
so you feel better ?
yes .
lying .
i feel good enough to help .
it &apos;d be nice if you found something ,
help everybody forget how mad they are at me .
the impromptu press conference ?
the chief of police seems to think that i &apos;m not camera @-@ friendly .
or just friendly . i don &apos;t know .
you are plenty friendly .
thank you .
most of the time .
okay .
so mit &apos;s test on the packing tape was inconclusive .
i &apos;ve run every analysis i can think of ,
and all the materials in the van turned up nothing .
i don &apos;t have a single bit of physical evidence
to identify alice sands , or anyone else .
so we can &apos;t prove that she &apos;s connected with the shooting ?
no .
so even if we find her , we can &apos;t arrest her .
no . but i did send a csru team back to examine
every step of her escape route , especially the alleyway .
all we need is a hair , a cell , a drop of blood .
we &apos;ll find something .
i like your optimism .
joe harris had financial problems .
he was a month or two from filing for bankruptcy
when alice arrived at the prison .
she saved his ass . yeah .
did he know the contract and the money came from alice ?
unclear .
he did . she &apos;s like a spider , luring people into her web .
she saves him , makes him think that she loves him .
eventually , he loves her back . he &apos;ll do anything for her .
burn down my apartment . kidnap maura .
die .
if alice is so charismatic ,
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t remember her from the academy .
i think she was too busy hating me to try to be friends .
a lot of people feel that way .
hey , maura .
csru finished their investigation of the alley .
okay . what &apos;d they find ?
nothing .
alice &apos;s dna isn &apos;t on the fire escape ladder .
there &apos;s no smudged fingerprints , like she wiped it down .
and more importantly ,
there &apos;s no disturbance in any of the dusty surfaces
on the higher rungs .
so she didn &apos;t go up the ladder .
no . our theory of how alice got away is wrong .
maybe she didn &apos;t make it this far .
we didn &apos;t see her on the street .
i mean , there &apos;s no place else she could &apos;ve gone .
we searched all these buildings .
then we missed her .
what if she didn &apos;t go up ?
she went down .
find anything ?
no . we went into the sewer about a hundred yards
and eventually lost the footprints .
and then the tunnels split off into three different directions ,
so should could be anywhere .
you smell bad .
don &apos;t go there .
from where she climbed in ,
she could be anywhere in the city .
it &apos;s the perfect way to move drugs around .
no wonder she was never caught .
you smell less than fresh .
what ?
you were gonna say something .
maybe .
what did the department of works say ?
well , apparently , hundreds of people live in the tunnels .
rousting them is not a budgetary priority ,
but sometimes when they &apos;re doing construction ,
the police clear &apos; em out .
you have a twinkle in your eye .
a couple days ago , a guy ran when he should have listened .
cops saw him dumping white powder down the runoff .
they couldn &apos;t recover it ,
so they couldn &apos;t arrest him for possession , but ...
do we know where he is ?
i have someone bringing him in right now .
yes !
sorry . we &apos;re not open .
joann .
angela .
how you doing ?
well , i guess not bad . you know , considering .
yeah . my dad said you were very brave .
yeah , well , ron &apos;s a little biased .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
no . actually , i , uh , i gotta go pick up the kids .
so ...
how are you doing ?
i ...
i know this is , uh , really hard .
yeah . well , that &apos;s an understatement .
yes .
my daughter was sitting with me
when i saw him on tv .
her brother found her in her room this morning , crying .
he -- he made her a police car out of legos and said ,
&quot; i &apos;ll keep grandpa safe . &quot;
he &apos;s 5 , angela .
he &apos;s not supposed to be thinking about things like that .
no , he &apos;s not . i &apos;m so sorry , joann .
i mean , my dad could &apos;ve been shot .
he -- or -- or -- or worse . my god .
i know .
i don &apos;t know why i came here . i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know w--
what i expect you to say . i just ...
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
you &apos;ve got work to do .
three strikes you &apos;re out , isaac .
look , i get loyalty , okay ?
but alice sands isn &apos;t gonna bake you cookies
while you rot upstate for 40 years .
she can &apos;t help you . we can help you ...
if you give us information that helps us find her .
i don &apos;t know where she is .
tell us how alice is using the tunnels .
we can get you gentle time . we can get you less time .
you won &apos;t do squat , and you know it .
fine . we tried nice .
now let &apos;s try naked . get your clothes off .
what ?
what ?
isaac weston , you are under arrest
for being an accessory after the fact
in the shooting of a bpd employee .
i &apos;ll get you a jumpsuit . you give me your clothes .
now .
she also isn &apos;t gonna bake you cookies .
i really don &apos;t need to be pushed to the door .
nobody does . that means you &apos;re leaving at the right time .
really ? it &apos;s embarrassing .
nothing i can do .
can i do this ?
all yours .
just got more embarrassing .
oh , come on . i &apos;d let you push me out of the hospital .
shouldn &apos;t you be at work ?
well , technically , helping a colleague is a work function .
besides , i don &apos;t have anything pressing going on right now .
i don &apos;t believe you .
are all patients this ornery ?
the food makes them angry .
well , we &apos;ll stop for a burger .
where &apos;s kent ?
oh . the test on the drug runner &apos;s clothes
are still in process .
no , i &apos;m not asking you . you &apos;re supposed to be taking it easy .
i am taking it easy .
yeah ?
where are we on the tests on the clothes ?
uh , in process . hey .
hey .
the bell was his idea .
so you &apos;re just sitting here .
the furthest i &apos;ve gone is the ladies &apos; room .
that &apos;s very unstubborn of you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you still have a headache ?
i &apos;m drinking chinese skullcap tea .
can you just ... answer a direct question ?
i &apos;m dealing with it .
all right .
please call me if you need anything .
of course .
okay .
still in process .
after you get the results from the ...
from ... the ...
the mass spectrometer ?
yes .
yeah , um , make sure to check the calibration .
yeah , of course . will do .
mass spectrometer .
mass spectrometer .
mass spectrometer .
she gives us food , clothes .
i don &apos;t have anything bad to say about her .
that &apos;s because you don &apos;t know her very well .
she &apos;s dangerous ,
and we need to find her before she hurts somebody else .
says you .
why don &apos;t we let the courts
decide whether she &apos;s a saint or a sinner ?
we just wanna know how to find her .
i don &apos;t know .
when was the last time you saw her ?
it &apos;s been a while .
the officers that found you two in the tunnels
said you were pretty well set up .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want us to be bothering you all the time .
don &apos;t you guys have better things to do ?
we do .
detective rizzoli ?
yeah .
alice says &quot; hello . &quot;
you tell alice to go to hell .
jane .
i assume you &apos;re familiar with the machine .
yes . i was on the advisory committee
when they did the revisions for the exposure standards .
i meant you know that you just lay down
and hold your breath when i ask you to .
of course . that , too .
it won &apos;t take long .
climb on up .
okay . well , thank you for getting me in early .
when the chief of staff says this is a priority ,
i assume it &apos;s a priority .
hey . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m just confirming the results .
they should be on dr. isles &apos; desk in about 10 minutes .
i called her . she didn &apos;t answer .
that &apos;s just information , right ? that &apos;s not a question ?
where is she ?
uh , she said she had an appointment .
when did she leave ?
about an hour and a half ago .
where did she go ?
i don &apos;t know .
why not ?
to be fair , i didn &apos;t think it was any of my business .
she suffered a head injury yesterday .
everything she does is your business .
now that we got that clear ...
jane .
shit .
hey ! what a nice surprise .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting some life @-@ saving procedure .
just finished rounds .
the , uh , med students were all thoroughly confused .
i think we helped everyone by stopping .
not ready to smile yet ?
sorry .
it was funny .
so what &apos;s going on ?
um , i wanna talk to you .
uh , i &apos;m free in 20 minutes . you wanna go to the cafeteria ?
i ...
i can &apos;t wait .
okay .
dr. williams , call intensive care .
dr. williams , intensive care .
the shooting , it &apos;s , uh ,
brought a lot of things into perspective for me .
i get that .
i have to break up with you .
what ?
i have to focus on my children and making sure they &apos;re okay .
so do you . and ...
i know this comes as a surprise ...
but it &apos;s the right thing to do .
no . no , it isn &apos;t . i ...
you &apos;re in shock , angela . you ...
i &apos;ve made up my mind .
just ...
i got shot at yesterday .
i know .
yeah , your friend &apos;s wedding .
yes .
all i &apos;m asking is that you take some time to let all this ...
sink in so that we can talk about things .
i &apos;m sorry , ron , but i &apos;ve made up my mind .
i need to write up my reports .
shouldn &apos;t you be recuperating somewhere ?
i &apos;m fine .
yeah , i &apos;ve been shot . it feels shitty , not fine .
thank you for saying that .
it was hurting just to sit up straight and breathe .
then what are you doing here ?
i just ...
i remember how i felt after my fiancé was shot .
powerless , scared .
i don &apos;t wanna feel like that again .
so you wanna find the person who shot you ?
more than anything .
you promise to go home when the pain gets too much ?
promise .
let &apos;s get started .
this is what we know .
yeah , do you need anything ?
a snack ? water ? anything like that ?
no , thank you , and you don &apos;t need to be getting me snacks .
ah . right . yeah .
it &apos;s just that detective rizzoli thinks
i &apos;m not taking my caregiving responsibilities seriously enough .
ah . well , she worries .
well , she &apos;s right .
when i ran away from being a doctor ,
i think i ran a little bit too far .
i guess i could be a bit more ... empathetic .
couldn &apos;t we all ?
you &apos;re very empathetic .
people have used a lot of words to describe me .
i &apos;m not sure that was ever one of them .
yeah , well , they don &apos;t know you , do they ?
but i do sometimes wonder
what kind of a doctor i would have been .
i mean , to live people .
a great one . brilliant even , if somewhat overdressed .
anyway , is that why you rang me ?
no . no , i have , um , i &apos;ve been thinking
that you have been here a while now ,
a lot longer than we originally planned .
yeah , well , god bless wilkins for needing a new kidney .
so i think you need more responsibilities .
perhaps a raise to go along with it .
so we can talk about it in the days to come .
uh , i mean , it &apos;s not like i haven &apos;t thought about it .
i &apos;ve got all these ideas and ...
okay . so shall we have lunch on monday ?
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i mean , i get it . she &apos;s angry . she &apos;s frustrated .
but it &apos;s not enough that nina got shot ?
the note was a location for a meeting . clearly a setup .
no rational person -- certainly no cop --
is gonna fall into a trap like that .
but why not just take the note and walk away ?
why fan the fire ?
i don &apos;t know why it bothers me so much .
i guess ...
i know i &apos;m going to retire .
someday . not too far in the future .
and jane &apos;s gonna work another 10 or 15 years at least .
what if her next partner isn &apos;t as ...
you love her .
yes . i ...
yes .
but i can only control the things i control , right ?
yeah .
right now i @-@ i have to do my job .
i just have to do my job and help jane find alice sands .
thank you .
‭ aren &apos;t i lucky to
have married the smartest woman in the world ?
yes .
later .
okay , her note said for me to meet her here ,
which means i can be ambushed from here , here , or here .
also gives alice an escape route through this tunnel ,
that access door , this steam vent .
she picked this area . it &apos;s because she &apos;s familiar with it .
maybe , but the drug runner was picked up near columbia road .
that &apos;s nowhere near here .
and she &apos;s too smart to draw all of bpd
into the part of the tunnels
that she &apos;s using for her organization .
you think she really expects you to meet her ?
no .
no , i think that she needs to regroup ,
and she &apos;s hoping that we waste some time playing out this thread .
so we ignore the note
and start looking for her around columbia road .
focus on sections of the system
that were built in the early 20th century .
where have you been ?
i had an appointment .
i will tell you about it later ,
because the mass spectrometer indicates
that the clothes you brought me from the drug runner
were dusted with clay , shale , iron --
all by @-@ products of the soft mud process ,
which is how bricks were made before steam machinery .
nina , how are you feeling ?
better , mostly . you ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m doing fine .
i &apos;m just fine .
below quincy street ,
there &apos;s a sealed off underground pumping station .
it was built in 1894,
then decommissioned after the great depression ,
when the federal government financed
a wpa @-@ related sewer rebuild .
so let &apos;s set a trap .
okay , you take this door here .
and i &apos;ll take the door at the end of the tunnel .
all right . everybody should be
in position at the other doors ,
if all has gone according to planned .
give two minutes till target time .
okay . see you inside .
careful .
careful &apos;s my middle name .
i know your middle name . i wish it was &quot; careful . &quot;
i &apos;m impressed , jane .
i didn &apos;t really think you &apos;d go where i tell you to ,
but i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d find me , either .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
so modest . that &apos;s how i remember you .
yeah , i doubt that &apos;s how you remember me .
i &apos;m just trying to be polite , jane .
the academy was a long time ago , alice .
you seem too smart to be still upset
about somebody who beat you in a rope climb .
you don &apos;t remember anything about me .
you just crammed a lifetime of crazy and disappointment
onto our shared history .
if you &apos;d been able to handle
just a little bit of competition ,
you &apos;d probably be the chief of police right now .
looking for your backup ?
there &apos;s only one way in .
we sealed the other doors .
you &apos;re alone .
put the gun down , alice . enough people have been hurt .
shoot the others .
no !
get on the ground ! all of you , get on the ground now !
get your hands behind your head !
hands behind your head now !
don &apos;t move .
we searched for three hours .
above ground , below ground . nothing .
‭ well , now you &apos;ve flushed her out .
and tomorrow , you &apos;ll figure out where she &apos;s gone .
i would love to continue today , but i just ...
the mind works better with rest .
yes .
i like your new place . it &apos;s homey .
thank you .
here you go .
i can &apos;t . i have to wait at least a few more days .
it &apos;s not bad enough that you have a concussion .
but alice took away alcohol as well ?
so where were you this afternoon ?
at the hospital .
and what &apos;d you find out ?
what makes you think i had to find out anything ?
because when you have something important to say ,
you always exhale a lot louder than when you don &apos;t .
i always thought it was a relaxation technique .
do i really do that ?
oh . i do do that .
you also have a tendency to change the subject
and ask a lot of questions when it &apos;s really bad news .
oh , everybody does that , don &apos;t they ?
like that .
i had some internal bleeding
to my temporal lobe from the fall ,
and it &apos;s caused some cognitive impairment .
so what are they gonna do ?
there &apos;s no reason to do anything .
you know , and the bleeding has stopped . i &apos;m fine .
the brain -- it &apos;s funny .
in two days , it might be like nothing ever happened .
but right now ?
i &apos;m forgetting things .
small things . words .
like &quot; mass spectrometer . &quot;
though obviously i remember it now
because i did a memory palace technique ealier today .
where i put the mass spectrometer in a different room .
maura .
that really helped ... helped me .
i &apos;m not gonna worry about the things i can &apos;t control .
i &apos;m gonna do what my doctor tells me to do
and i &apos;m going to let my friends help me
if i have a few small problems .
of course .
we &apos;ll get through it .
i know .
blessed virgin mary , mother of my god ,
intercede for me
that i may obtain the grace to make a good confession .
all your blessed archangels , angels and saints of god ,
pray for me .
amen .
in the name of father , the son and the holy spirit . amen .
forgive me father , for i have sinned .
it &apos;s been ... really long time since my last confession .
i &apos;m not really sure what i should say .
there are ... a lot of reasons
that i should come here .
i &apos;m sure
none of them are why i &apos;m here today .
what have you come to confess jane ?
what have you done ?
someone &apos;s after me .
they &apos;re hurting my friends ,
my family .
it &apos;s not what i &apos;ve done .
it &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
