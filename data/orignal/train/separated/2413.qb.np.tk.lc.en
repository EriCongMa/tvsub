he &apos;s dead .
no , no ! i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t .
we all want the cure . where is it ?
i know someone has it .
katherine .
the doppelganger ?
she had someone on the inside .
hayley , what did you do ?
where did katherine find her ?
new orleans .
i can help you . turn it off .
her humanity , damon .
that was all she had left .
humanity means nothing
when you don &apos;t have anyone to care about , stefan .
every inch of this house--
it &apos;s filled with memories of the people that have died .
we &apos;re gonna lose her , damon .
she needs time . it &apos;s only been a couple of days .
her humanity is off .
she &apos;s basically numb to everything that makes her who she is .
she &apos;s a vampire .
the off switch is one of the biggest perks .
when being undead gets you down , voila .
vampire prozac .
she burned down her family home
with her brother &apos;s dead body still inside .
saves us the trouble of having to do it ourselves .
i call that a win .
worst @-@ case scenario ,
i &apos;ll invoke the sire bond
and tell her to turn it back on .
no . her brother just died .
you force all that grief on her at once ,
it &apos;s gonna overwhelm her .
we need to give her a reason to want to turn it on .
fine . we &apos;ll show her a good time .
i know it &apos;s controversial , stefan ,
but people actually like to have fun .
you really think that &apos;s gonna work ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
are you all right ?
was there an accident ? where are you hurt ? are you in pain ?
i don &apos;t feel anything .
i have a blanket in my car .
try not to move . i &apos;ll call for help .
what are you doing ?
that &apos;s enough .
i said that &apos;s enough .
we agreed no killing .
this is the first person i &apos;ve seen in days
whose body isn &apos;t laced with vervain , and i &apos;m hungry .
you leave a trail of bodies ,
people are gonna start asking questions .
i don &apos;t care .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re making me say this .
show a little restraint .
i thought this was supposed to be fun .
have a care , mate .
that &apos;s no way to treat a lady .
you came .
well , you did say it was urgent .
oh , don &apos;t worry about him , love .
he &apos;ll never make it through tomorrow night .
what if there are more ?
you were foolish enough to make a deal with katerina petrova .
she used you to find the cure ,
and now you &apos;re nothing but a loose end .
you &apos;ll be lucky if she lets you live .
you said you would protect me .
and i will ,
just as soon as you tell me everything you know about katerina .
so that &apos;s the plan ?
you &apos;re gonna take her back to school ?
well , the fun route didn &apos;t exactly pay off , did it ?
i don &apos;t know . we got a free meal out of it .
look . do you think i want to go to school and play chaperone ?
you can &apos;t go because you &apos;re not a student .
besides , you &apos;ve got to go look for katherine .
i mean , elena needs this cure now more than ever .
not that anyone asked me ,
but i think taking her back to school is a great idea .
why are you here ?
blame it on your fancy water filters .
your house has the only vervain @-@ free showers in town .
oh , yeah . the mayor put vervain in the water supply .
so many people to kill .
yeah , and my mom says it &apos;s about to get worse ,
so she could use a little help .
fine . i &apos;ll go after the psychotic doppelganger .
stefan , you gonna go talk to the sheriff ?
blondie , take her to school .
sounds like fun .
what ? it &apos;s nothing you guys haven &apos;t seen before .
and as for the &quot; going to school &quot; idea ...
i &apos;ve got nothing better to do .
elena , it would make me very happy
if you were in school today
and studied hard--
you know , get involved in whatever activities ,
and please , for me , no matter what ,
don &apos;t eat anyone .
ok ?
杰里米 · 吉尔伯特
tyler . it &apos;s me checking in .
things are just getting back to normal here ,
sort of .
elena &apos;s not quite there ,
but we &apos;re working on it .
look , i know that you can &apos;t call me back ,
but i keep thinking if i just leave these messages
that when you do come home it &apos;ll be like you never left .
or that &apos;s the hope .
i &apos;d better go .
i love you , tyler .
have you seen bonnie ?
yeah . i called her last night . she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s just a little drained from , you know , everything .
can &apos;t really blame her .
yeah .
i have an idea .
can you get me my old spot back on the cheerleading squad ?
i mean , technically , yeah .
i &apos;m captain , but i thought you hated cheerleading .
i did , and now i think it would be really fun
to jump around and toss people up in the air .
it &apos;s not like the routines are that hard .
i ... think that would make damon really happy .
ah , what an unpleasant surprise .
so i just came up with a list
called things you suck at .
number one : finding katherine , ever .
number two : covering up your secret phone conversations
to that little backstabber hayley .
yeah , so where is she ,
and what does she know about katherine ?
i should help you ?
after you lot killed my brother
and imprisoned me in the gilbert living room ?
you might want to prioritize , klaus .
you have much bigger problems .
katherine has the cure .
my guess is she &apos;s gonna want to cram it down your throat .
you help me find katherine ,
i &apos;ll get the cure , i &apos;ll give it to elena ,
everybody wins .
just let me question hayley about katherine .
can &apos;t help you , mate .
hayley &apos;s all mine .
although i did have a run @-@ in
with a vampire who may know where katerina is .
too bad for you i bit halfway through his bloody neck .
he probably won &apos;t have much time for chit @-@ chat .
the entire supply of blood from the hospital ,
all the reserves , gone , just vanished .
i don &apos;t understand . are you accusing us ?
no , i &apos;m not accusing you ,
but this town is at a tipping point .
any more unexplained house fires ,
and things are gonna boil over .
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s been a rough week .
miranda gilbert was one of my best friends in high school .
to see what &apos;s happened to her family--
it &apos;s just ...
look , liz ...
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help ,
i promise i will .
good . you need to .
whoever stole that blood
put a lot of lives in danger
and risks exposing all of you ,
my daughter included .
so who can you think of who wants blood that bad ,
who would be so careless ?
the uniform still fits .
you look fantastic .
we are totally gonna kick grove hill &apos;s ass .
yeah . should be fun .
my god . you guys , i left my makeup back on the bus .
the competition &apos;s bigger than last year .
i &apos;m gonna go stretch .
i like your ribbon .
thanks .
i want it .
yeah , but i &apos;m using it , so go get your own .
where were you ? we &apos;re going on any minute .
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
what &apos;s with the ribbon ?
that &apos;s not even our colors .
are you out of your mind ?
what is your problem ?
feeding on the competition ?
hello . did you not hear what damon told you ?
i did , but who cares ? i &apos;ll do whatever i want .
everything all right ?
yeah , as soon as the queen backs off ,
everything will be fine .
remember how damon sired her to behave ?
it didn &apos;t really work .
what do you mean , she fed ?
i specifically told her , no feeding .
the sire bond should make her listen .
right . that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
the sire bond isn &apos;t working .
that &apos;s impossible .
think about it .
elena &apos;s sire bond stems from her feelings for you , right ?
with her humanity off , she has no feelings .
all i wanted was to break that damn bond .
you &apos;re telling me now this whole time
all she had to do was turn it off ?
what happens if she turns it back on ?
i don &apos;t know , but more importantly ,
where are you right now ?
i &apos;m at a truck stop in the boonies
looking for a dead vampire
that might lead to katherine and the cure .
look , just grab her and get her home .
i &apos;ll be there when i can .
you .
i thought you were still vacationing on numbskull island .
well , i was looking for answers ,
and all i found was your professor shane , dead ,
and with him , anything anyone knows about the cure .
guess you won &apos;t turn into a real girl after all .
i &apos;ll get the cure .
i just need katherine , and i &apos;m betting you can help me find her .
why would i help you ?
because i was smart enough to bring a pinch of my brother &apos;s blood .
how else would you interrogate
a vampire who &apos;s practically dead from a wolf bite ?
fine . follow me .
i might know where to look .
so you &apos;re rested ,
you &apos;re fed .
tell me about katerina .
most men get their power kick from torture and intimidation .
with you , it &apos;s drinks and fine dining .
well , in your case , i favor hospitality over unpleasantness ,
but i have been known to change my mind on a whim .
where is katerina ?
you seriously think i know ?
you tipped her off as to what we were up to
and set her on a course to find the cure .
in return , she sent her lackey to snuff you out .
tell me ,
what did katerina promise you ?
i was in new orleans
trying to find information about my real parents .
katherine found me and told me she could help .
an orphan ?
well , that does explain your charming bravado .
abandonment issues will do it every time .
sounds like you would know .
i &apos;m the only one that can protect you .
i &apos;m happy to do so , provided you cooperate .
hey , we need to talk .
so talk . you can help me stretch .
ok .
did you feed on that cheerleader ?
maybe .
i see .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know anything
about the hospital &apos;s missing blood supply , would you ?
trust me . i &apos;m sick of blood bags .
i prefer something a little warmer .
look , elena , i know what you &apos;re going through .
i was having the time of my life when i first turned , too .
i didn &apos;t start ripping people &apos;s heads off until 1912 .
the next thing i know , i was killing an entire village .
am i supposed to be scared of becoming you ?
yeah , you are ,
because i know how deep down you can fall ,
and i know how difficult it is to climb back out .
come on .
you &apos;re better than this .
i don &apos;t know . maybe this is the better version of me .
up next , mystic falls &apos; very own lady timberwolves .
no way . you are not cheering .
let &apos;s see you try and stop me .
ladies and gentlemen ,
give it up for your very own lady timberwolves .
ready !
l @-@ o @-@ l , o @-@ m @-@ g
you &apos;re looking at mystic falls varsity !
b @-@ e @-@ a @-@ t , beat those caps .
b @-@ e @-@ a @-@ t , beat those caps .
b @-@ e @-@ a @-@ t , beat those caps !
nice move .
what do you do for an encore ?
i &apos;m pretty sure it doesn &apos;t involve another condescending lecture .
no . i was impressed .
getting yourself on the cheerleading squad .
plenty of vervain @-@ free victims bused in for the competition .
you played us all really well .
it wasn &apos;t that hard .
you want me to be ok so badly
that you hear whatever i want you to .
right . well , you know , the problem with the gymnasium is ,
too many witnesses .
you got to go somewhere a little more private for some real fun .
oh , yeah ? where ?
i know this little dive bar off the beaten path .
come on .
you &apos;re bluffing .
you &apos;re forgetting that i had my switch flipped in this town too .
i know where to take someone to have a good time .
but first , a little vervain .
just to take the edge off .
why exactly would you think
a sick vampire would check into a hospital ?
see that little bright thing in the sky ?
it &apos;s called the sun .
he needs to avoid that .
plus the hospital is open 24 / 7 .
not to mention he &apos;s hungry and delusional .
impressive . you &apos;re like sherlock holmes with brain damage .
stefan said the mystic falls hospital
had its entire blood bank raided too .
it looks like our vampire gets around .
no . the guy &apos;s dying of a werewolf bite .
he wouldn &apos;t have time to steal from both hospitals .
this is someone else .
who ?
that &apos;s another problem .
but on the plus side , if our guy did by chance come here ,
he &apos;s got nothing , which means he &apos;s nearby and he &apos;s hungry .
this better not be a wild goose chase .
i want to find katherine as much as you do .
really ? why ?
i heard your little chat with stefan .
i know elena has broken the sire bond .
so why would you want to find the cure ?
you &apos;d just cure her back to loving your brother .
i think you &apos;re best off leaving it for me .
hate that .
too much .
i don &apos;t get that .
i don &apos;t care .
hmm . this one .
it doesn &apos;t make me want to puke .
why &apos;d you paint it ?
painting is a metaphor for control .
every choice is mine ...
the canvas , the color .
as a child , i had neither a sense of the world
nor my place in it , but art taught me
that one &apos;s vision can be achieved with sheer force of will .
the same is true of life .
provided one refuses to let anything stand in one &apos;s way .
so this is your thing ...
show a girl a few mediocre paintings ,
whine about your childhood ,
and i swoon and spill all my dirty secrets ?
i felt i had many charms ,
but , uh , regardless , i &apos;m enjoying myself .
and you do whatever you enjoy .
up to and including hunting my friend tyler for the next century .
oh , surely not the next century .
only until i kill him .
you talk a good game ,
but the truth is you let him go .
my guess ? you know if you kill him
caroline will hate you forever .
if i simply killed tyler
my revenge would be over in a moment .
sentencing him to a lifetime of paranoia and fear--
that &apos;s tyler &apos;s true punishment .
but come now .
you never really thought there was a future for you two , did you ?
i don &apos;t know .
he might have left caroline for me
if i &apos;d used the cure to kill you .
you know , if tyler has even half your resolve
he may actually make it through the year .
it doesn &apos;t take resolve .
it takes allies
a network of people willing to do anything for you ,
including chase down loose ends to their death .
that &apos;s how katherine escaped you all this time .
perhaps you know the names of katerina &apos;s special little helpers .
maybe i know one or two .
maybe i &apos;ll even tell you .
what &apos;d you do to me ?
brought you home before you can cause any more trouble .
so you &apos;re grounding me
because i dropped caroline on her thick head .
no , because you fed on someone ... in public .
so ? i was hungry .
you &apos;re really gonna keep stripping in front of me ?
it &apos;s real mature .
i &apos;m done cheering , so i &apos;m gonna change .
sure . when in doubt manipulate people with sex .
you know , that &apos;s the same trick katherine used to pull .
don &apos;t compare me to katherine .
she &apos;s been running so long
she &apos;s afraid of her own shadow .
i am not afraid of anything .
i &apos;ve shut it all off--all of it ,
including my feelings for you .
but don &apos;t get me wrong .
i mean , i see you standing there
and you look good .
i remember our sex , and it was good sex .
i just don &apos;t feel anything about it anymore .
though you clearly do .
why do you care what i do and who i kill ?
because it &apos;s my fault that you &apos;re like this .
i brought this into your life .
look , i &apos;ve killed hundreds of people
and i have to live with that ,
but i &apos;m not gonna live with the people that you kill
or what that &apos;ll do to you .
who are you texting ?
look at you . your whole world revolves around me .
maybe you &apos;re the one that needs to turn it all off .
what is that ?
so that &apos;s what all this texting was about ?
you invited all these people over here .
you were trying to keep me from throwing the party
so ... i brought the party here .
great .
that &apos;s great .
i got here as soon as i could . this is insane .
yeah . it won &apos;t last .
they &apos;ll either drink all the booze and get bored ,
or damon will come home and kill everyone .
we can &apos;t compel them to leave .
the locals are all on vervain from the town water supply .
yeah .
so , what do we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
enjoy the party
keep elena from butchering grove hill &apos;s cheerleading squad .
great . and where is she ?
where do you think ?
i almost forgot what that was like .
what ? elena smiling ?
no . fun .
i mean , look at her .
yes , this is all very bad ,
but doesn &apos;t she make you just want to let go ?
well , unfortunately i have this little problem
when i , uh , party too hard .
i end up killing people .
well , your sober coach is giving you the green light .
i mean , come on . you are at a kegger full of hot girls ,
and you &apos;re single , and you &apos;re , well , you .
so , what am i supposed to do ?
just grab some girl , throw her over my shoulder ,
take her out onto the dance floor ?
just take your own advice .
have fun , you know ?
we deserve a little bit of fun .
ok .
whoa ! i didn &apos;t mean me !
well , nobody could ever mistake you for subtle .
you have to take pride in your work .
it &apos;s ok . come here .
now you &apos;re gonna walk very slowly to your car .
off you go .
you know , i just don &apos;t see how this increases our odds any .
i &apos;ve been on the other side of a wolf bite .
first you get really sick .
then you get really hungry .
since the sun &apos;s gone down ,
i &apos;m imagining he &apos;s gonna be looking for his last supper .
i just laid out a 3 @-@ course , 115 @-@ pound meal for him .
damon ?
will ?
hey , buddy .
i think there &apos;s something wrong with me .
i need help .
yeah . it &apos;s ok .
i know what to do .
what the bloody hell are you doing ?
too far gone .
put him out of his misery .
my sister informs me that your vampire assailant is dead ,
so you &apos;re safe and free to go .
or stay .
i could be persuaded to stay ,
enjoy some of the good life .
and maybe i could drum up a few more of katherine &apos;s secrets
and you could do something for me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , love .
you &apos;ll never convince me to let tyler go free .
well , then , i guess i &apos;ll never get my chance with tyler
any more than you &apos;ll get a shot with caroline .
do you want to know why i like that painting ?
well , perhaps it was because it allowed you
to see into my deep , wounded soul .
i saw how twisted it really is .
and maybe i can relate .
so what &apos;s it gonna be ?
going ...
or staying ?
you like to be in control , you told me .
look who finally joined the party .
yeah . why ? are you jealous or something ?
no . that would imply emotions .
and we &apos;ve already established those are useless .
come on , elena . just dance with us .
no . you guys look good together .
by all means , care , just take him out for a spin .
he could use it .
elena .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
just some underage drinking and drug use .
where &apos;s stefan ?
he &apos;s actually busy flirting with your daughter .
but i think he &apos;s a good rebound for her
because of the whole tyler thing .
i &apos;m shutting this down right now .
liz , please . why don &apos;t you just stay and have a drink ?
elena , take your hand off me .
either you have a drink , or i will .
mom !
i &apos;m fine .
caroline , calm down .
calm down ? i &apos;m gonna wring her skinny little neck !
elena !
where the hell is she ?
right where she wants to be .
this is completely calculated .
she drew all those people to the house ,
waited for an opportunity to distract us ,
and now she &apos;s free .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s doing this .
i mean , she hurt my mom , stefan .
all right , listen .
you search the woods . i &apos;ll check the road .
if you see her , don &apos;t hesitate .
just snap her neck , all right ?
yeah .
ok .
thank you .
will you please just take a hint and leave me alone ?
what are you hiding ?
i know you knew that vampire .
i know a lot of dead people .
you killed him to prevent me from finding katherine
to keep me from getting the cure .
do you really want the cure ?
i mean really ?
look . let me give you a little bit of advice .
see these girls ?
they look happy now .
in 5 years ,
they &apos;re gonna settle for a mediocre starter husband
and a mind @-@ numbing career ,
and about that time , they &apos;re gonna realize
something you &apos;re never gonna have to learn .
and what would that be ?
life sucks when you &apos;re ordinary .
and what makes you exactly not like them ?
you &apos;re a vampire .
you take that cure , become human ,
well , you &apos;re no one , nothing .
trust me . losing this cure
is the best damn thing that ever happened to you .
elena !
don &apos;t make me fight you , elena !
i &apos;m stronger than you , and i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
who &apos;s gonna get hurt ?
not bad . not technically good ,
but then again , alaric didn &apos;t train you .
you were probably too busy butting into people &apos;s business !
oh , just stop !
god . this isn &apos;t you , and you know it !
you hurt my mom , elena .
how far are you gonna take this ?
are you trying to make me feel bad for hurting your mom ?
don &apos;t you get it ? i don &apos;t care .
i mean , maybe you should try to turn it all off .
who knows ?
you might stop whining about how tyler left you .
an added bonus :
you won &apos;t have to feel guilty
about all the dirty thoughts you have about klaus .
shut up .
make me .
you fight like a girl .
let go of me !
i admit , under any other circumstances ,
this would be a major turn @-@ on .
get her out of here .
hey , tyler . it &apos;s me .
you &apos;ll never believe the crazy day i &apos;ve had .
look , i know that you said you wouldn &apos;t ,
but i really wish that you would answer .
it would be great to talk to you .
you all right ?
besides the fact that my best friend tried to kill me ?
look , it &apos;s not her . you have to remember that .
with her emotions off , she &apos;s the worst version of herself .
so how do we get her back ?
or what if we can &apos;t ?
why would she choose to turn her emotions back on ?
she &apos;s an orphan . she just lost her brother .
her life sucks , stefan .
so why would she come back to us ?
even when i was at my worst ,
elena didn &apos;t give up on me .
so we can &apos;t give up on her .
deal ?
how much longer am i supposed to sit here ?
well , i &apos;m not big on goal @-@ setting ,
but let &apos;s just imagine a time
when you don &apos;t want to kill your best friend .
are you judging me ?
how many times have you tried to kill stefan ?
what is that ?
one of life &apos;s many mysteries .
elena , look--
don &apos;t .
every time someone starts with &quot; elena , &quot;
i get some stupid lecture .
everyone just needs to stop telling me
that i need to feel .
i do feel , damon . i feel amazing .
you don &apos;t want to be like this .
then how should i be ?
should i go back to being the scared little girl
who couldn &apos;t admit what she wants ?
is that how you &apos;d prefer me to go back to being , or--
look .
for the longest time , you wanted to be with me ,
but you were scared that i &apos;d find out how awful you are .
but it doesn &apos;t matter anymore
because i don &apos;t care .
be honest .
you like me better like this .
matt ?
care .
matt , why can &apos;t i get inside ?
come in .
matt , what &apos;s going on ?
tyler sent me this package in the mail .
this is for you .
dear care ,
i miss you more than i can put into words .
but i know as long as klaus is alive ,
i can &apos;t come home .
he won &apos;t stop trying to kill me ,
and you won &apos;t stop trying to protect me ,
which means the only way to make sure you &apos;re safe
is for me to go and never come back .
i left matt the deed to the house .
it will protect you in ways i can &apos;t anymore .
i will always love you .
he &apos;s not coming back .
sorry .
running away , little wolf ?
what ?
that mark . i &apos;ve seen it before .
yeah . it &apos;s a birthmark .
people have those .
in my considerable lifetime ,
i &apos;ve only seen that mark on a handful of others ,
all from the same bloodline ,
a werewolf clan that once thrived
throughout much of what we now call louisiana .
don &apos;t lie to me--
not about this .
i wouldn &apos;t dare .
matters of family are sacred .
tell me .
sheriff forbes . everything ok ?
no , we have a big problem .
where the hell are you ?
out for a drive . i need some space .
it &apos;s not me . it &apos;s you .
well , we got a little problem .
you said blood was stolen from grove hill &apos;s hospital .
the sheriff said there &apos;s been reports
of 6 other blood bank thefts
all within 30 miles of mystic falls .
somebody &apos;s stockpiling blood .
it wasn &apos;t elena , and it &apos;s not us .
ok , so ...
i think silas followed us back from that island .
he hasn &apos;t fed in 2,000 years ,
so he would need to gorge on blood .
it explains the thefts .
you know , i &apos;m really not in the mood
to scooby doo our way through the case of the stolen blood supply .
so why don &apos;t you hold the fort down until i get back ,
and i &apos;ll be in touch , brother .
he &apos;s gonna hate you for that .
yeah , well , emotions are overrated .
so where are we going ?
a place every newbie vampire
should go at least once in their life--
new york .
