i got her !
no , no , no . no , emily .
stay with me . come on , stay with me .
where &apos;s my medic ? !
she never made it off the table .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to say good @-@ bye .
penelope , you gotta stop staring at her .
i can &apos;t help it .
you know everyone &apos;s feeling it and nobody wants to talk about it .
it &apos;s too soon , aaron .
doesn &apos;t strauss usually run these assessments ?
there was no way that was gonna happen .
internalizing does make it worse .
i &apos;ll talk , but i don &apos;t want to talk about her being gone .
it &apos;s like if we can &apos;t keep each other safe ,
then why are we even doing any of this ?
if i had just gotten there 60 seconds earlier ,
emily might still be with us .
derek , you know that you did everything you could .
so where does that leave me ?
angry .
you know , we , um , we come in here
and we talk to you .
where do you go ?
dude , when she &apos;s trapped in the ceiling
and those cuts just appear .
dude . classic horror .
cheesy special effects , but , damn , you were scared .
nice .
unnecessary . there &apos;s too much blood and gore and eew .
garcia , it &apos;s a slasher film .
how do you do a slasher film without violence ?
you imply it .
baby , the movie is called &quot; slice 6 . &quot;
what were you expecting ?
a refreshing beverage with a twist of comedy .
i &apos;m gonna have nightmares for a week .
with everything that we do and see on a daily basis ,
that got to you ?
listen , newb , you may be all sigourney weaver ass @-@ kicking tough ,
which is awesome ,
but the mystical mavens of innocence like myself
jump at things that go bump in the night .
why are you worried ? i &apos;m sure that morgan will protect you .
as long as he &apos;s not jumping out of his chair
like a prepubescent schoolgirl .
the only reason i jumped is &apos; cause you guys woke me up .
how coulyou sleep during that ?
easy . you drag me out after a 12 @-@ hour workday-- for what ?
you telling me that girl didn &apos;t know that the unsub
was waiting for her upstairs ? come on , now .
villain .
what ?
in movies , unsubs are called villains .
my bad .
you want to know why horror movies are so successful ?
why is that , genius ?
they prey on our instinctual need to survive .
in tribal days , a woman &apos;s scream would signal danger
and the men would return from hunting to protect their pack .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s always the women and not the men
who fall victim to the bogeyman .
count on you , reid , to break a movie down to science .
my favorite thing about horror movies
is the suspense factor .
ah , the ticking clock .
the helpless victim walks through the dark ...
shadows reaching out to get her .
a sudden noise draws her attention .
is someone there , or is it just in her head ?
still , it &apos;s totally unrealistic .
no one should be walking
through a dark alley by themselves at night .
hello .
no one should be walking through a dark alley
without a derek morgan by their side .
but the best part of a horror movie--
you never know when the end is gonna come .
damn it .
michelle ?
i wasn &apos;t expecting you back till the morning .
aah ! no ! aah ! aah !
no ! no !
go away !
no ! no !
what we didn &apos;t see coming
is the slicer &apos;s brother was in the closet .
frightening .
his betrayal consumed him and he sent his brother
to his own private hell .
speaking of horror ...
what &apos;s strauss doing here ?
whatever it is , i cast my vote on &quot; not good . &quot;
i was expecting the grief assessments yesterday .
i left them on your desk last night .
oh , well , good .
the next step , your team will be observed in the field .
this really isn &apos;t the time for another evaluation .
when is a good time ?
you &apos;ve decided this without reading the assessments ?
is there something that i should know ?
no , it &apos;s just that everyone grieves differently
and this team is no exception .
all right , fine . i will look at your findings ,
but just know that there will be another review .
when do you leave for san diego ?
as soon as we present the case .
good .
let &apos;s get started .
ok .
monica shanley , natalie wallace , amber lasko .
3 college students killed in their off @-@ campus apartments
in the last 5 days .
two were going to san diego coastal university ,
one was going to san diego tech .
well , the unsub definitely has a type . they could all be related .
yeah , what he said . they &apos;re all in their early 20s ,
brunette , majoring in education
and / or child development .
is there any indication that they knew one another ?
as it stands right now , i &apos;m coming up empty .
their apartments were spread throughout the city , so ...
no fingerprints at the crime scene . the unsub uses gloves .
he &apos;s organized .
forced entry at all the apartments .
back door , patio door , living room window .
the homes were wrecked . clear evidence of a struggle .
he &apos;s creating a scene .
he wants to inflict fear not only in his victim
but in whomever finds the body .
could be a message to the local p.d.
&quot; look what i can do . &quot;
he &apos;s killed 3 women in under a week .
in all likelihood , he &apos;s hunting for his fourth victim now .
san diego p.d. wants us on the scene as soon as possible .
stephen king wrote ,
&quot; sometimes human places create inhuman monsters . &quot;
our unsub has a type and a temper .
amber was getting ready for her bath .
it would have been an easy
target for a sexual assault , but none came .
that &apos;s highly unusual behavior for this kind of unsub .
you know , extreme violence in physical aggression
is in its nature sexual .
that &apos;s true , but as a substitution for the sex act .
this guy could be impotent .
he can &apos;t perform , so that &apos;s why he goes all out for the kill .
if he &apos;s targeting female college students ,
we need to make sure that campus officials
are informed if they haven &apos;t been already .
we also can &apos;t rule out other students and faculty .
you know , san diego &apos;s essentially one big college town ,
with an enrollment at sdcu
of approximately 65,000 students .
san diego county has 9 universities--
5 private , 4 public .
we add 7 more if we &apos;re including trade schools .
each girl lived off @-@ campus
and was attacked in their apartment .
that &apos;s pretty high @-@ risk .
less risky if he &apos;s stalking them in advance ,
running layouts and routines .
between classes and part @-@ time jobs ,
they &apos;d be home sporadically at best .
which tells us they &apos;re not victims of opportunity .
he targets them , then stalks them
to know where they live and when they &apos;re gonna be alone .
morgan , you and reid go to the last victim &apos;s apartment .
seaver , interview the roommate .
dave and i will go to the medical examiner &apos;s .
well , there &apos;s no secure parking .
i rode a bike when i was in college .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you weren &apos;t old enough to drive , einstein .
i could drive . it &apos;s just the government
wouldn &apos;t issue me a license until i was 14 .
a lot of places for the unsub to hide out here .
yeah , he could have easily grabbed her
when she passed through here .
yet she made it all the way to her apartment .
where she should feel safe , but then he took that from her .
all of the women have defensive
wounds on the arms . they put up a fight .
the number of stab wounds increases with each victim , yes ?
yes . on monica shanley , the wounds show hesitation .
and the fatal blow is directly to the heart .
did the strike indicate
any medical knowledge on the part of the unsub ?
truthfully , i think he got lucky .
he hadn &apos;t built his confidence yet .
yeah , but by the time he gets to his third kill ,
he knows what he &apos;s doing .
more direct cuts .
she died from massive blood loss .
he &apos;s improving quickly .
he made the struggle last longer because he wanted her to suffer .
so now he &apos;s starting to enjoy it .
i &apos;m agent derek morgan .
this is dr. spencer reid .
detective bryce harding .
amber &apos;s roommate michelle told us she was out of town
visiting family when the attack occurred .
the unsub must have known that .
that &apos;s why he made his move last night .
he jimmied the lock on the window .
i guess he needed the privacy to complete the torture .
well , most sadists like to kill on their own turf .
this guy didn &apos;t risk taking her to a secondary location .
maybe something happened which makes
the location of the kill significant . look .
that &apos;s something new . he &apos;s smearing blood on the walls ,
exhibiting more control and rage
over his victims , taking pleasure in the kill .
what &apos;s with the specific physical type ?
it looks like he &apos;s taking his anger out
on women who represent someone he knows .
yeah , like edmund kemper .
he most likely can &apos;t confront his true target yet ,
so he &apos;s going after women who look like her
until he can build up the confidence to complete his endgame .
sorry about that . what can i get you ?
i should have been there to help her .
amber and i were friends since the third grade .
always inseparable .
she got into san diego coastal first .
i was so pissed .
i didn &apos;t talk to her for a week .
and then 2 days later my acceptance letter came in the mail .
it &apos;s ok , michelle .
it &apos;s not that i wasn &apos;t happy for her ,
i just wanted to go , too .
i know . it &apos;s a completely normal reaction .
but i need you to think ,
had any new people come into her life recently ?
not that i know of .
i had to twist her arm to get her out .
so she wasn &apos;t into the college scene .
she could party with the best of them .
she just worked her ass off .
academically or for money ?
money . if it wasn &apos;t dog @-@ walking at 10 bucks an hour ,
it was house @-@ sitting or proofreading . she kept busy .
so she took on a lot of odd jobs .
she wasn &apos;t a rich kid from orange county .
do you know where she heard about the part @-@ time work ?
everywhere .
coffeehouses , craigslist , the student center .
you name it .
thank you .
the first victim monica shanley &apos;s bff
reported that they were talking on the phone and hung up
just before monica stepped inside her apartment .
what does that get us ?
well , some neighbors heard loud screaming
coming from monica &apos;s apartment at 11 : 12 p.m.
15 they called 911 .
26 cops arrived .
he &apos;s able to strike , kill , and get out in less than 14 minutes ?
how &apos;d it go ?
according to her roommate ,
amber worked odd jobs to make ends meet .
could be where she made contact with the unsub .
garcia , get us a list of jobs
that amber worked the last few months ,
and look for personal checks she might
have deposited as under @-@ the @-@ table payments .
copy that .
the unsub stalks his victims .
he knows their routine .
he could attack them anytime they &apos;re alone , even in their cars .
but he chooses to attack them in their homes .
and waits for them to bolt the doors before he strikes .
he wants them to feel safe before he takes that away from them .
it &apos;s about making them feel powerless
in their own personal space .
so it &apos;s physical and psychological torture .
if he keeps to his accelerated timetable ,
he &apos;ll strike tonight .
hello , guy .
you ok ?
is that you making all that noise ? hm ?
you &apos;re so adorable .
you want to pose for the camera ?
everything &apos;s untouched , as requested .
vic &apos;s name is laurie burgin , student at san diego tech .
she was babysitting .
we profiled that he gets off by striking
inside the victims &apos; homes .
why did he kill her here ?
that &apos;s a big change in m.o.
maybe laurie had a roommate , so the unsub figured
he &apos;d have more time on the job .
did he hurt the child ?
kid was crying in the crib when the family got home .
i &apos;ll talk to them . you two go on in .
mr. and mrs. jenkins , i &apos;m david rossi with the fbi .
do you mind if i ask you a few questions ?
of course . whatever you need .
now , was laurie a family friend ?
no .
we &apos;re new to the area .
we haven &apos;t had time to make friends yet .
and how did you meet her ?
online . craigslist .
i told him not to do it .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
we both work . i looked into nanny services ,
but the start @-@ up costs were ridiculous .
how many people did you interview ?
i lost count .
she seemed like the right fit .
she was a college student , didn &apos;t party too much .
she was a hard worker .
and little julian loved her .
did she talk about any boyfriends
or say anything that may have raised an alarm ?
not that i can think of .
she was single . she had a boyfriend back in tennessee ,
but they broke up .
and how long ago was that ?
a month , i think .
i &apos;m not sure .
thank you .
with an infant in the room ,
laurie would have been at her most vulnerable .
look at this .
he felt compelled to organize the supplies .
look .
do you think the unsub fed the kid ?
then he stabs laurie , so the kid probably started crying .
maybe he gave the kid the bottle in order to keep him quiet .
what kind of an unsub stops murdering to care for an infant ?
one who identifies with the child .
we might be looking for someone
with a deep @-@ rooted abandonment issue .
or maybe the baby crying interfered with his enjoyment
of watching the babysitter bleed out ?
well , either way , caring for the child
would be psychological torture for laurie .
reid .
look at that .
she &apos;s got several missed calls and a few text messages
from social networking sites .
&quot; what &apos;s with the photo ? halloween isn &apos;t for months . &quot;
speak , boy wonder , behold my might .
garcia , the latest victim laurie burgin
was writing something on the internet last night .
can you figure out what it was ?
yeah . i was just tweeting myself . uno momento .
oh , god .
reid .
she managed to take a picture of the unsub before she died .
can &apos;t really make it out .
i can tell you more . laurie &apos;s account was active
2 hours after that photo was posted .
well , there &apos;s no record of her calling 911 .
he must have uploaded the image himself .
and continued posting status updates after she died .
&quot; feeling faint at heart . &quot;
&quot; all alone and too scared to cry . &quot;
all right , this isn &apos;t good .
he &apos;s mocking his victims now .
he sat here tweeting while laurie bled to death .
all right , baby girl , listen .
i need you to go through laurie &apos;s accounts .
see who was following her and see who was messaging back .
on it .
all right , let &apos;s get out of here ,
let &apos;s get back to hotch . we got a photo and we got a profile .
thank you , garcia .
we &apos;re looking for a white male in his early 20s .
and because he &apos;s stalking his victims ,
we believe that he either works out of his house
or a part @-@ time job .
this unsub strikes in the home rather than outside
where he could more easily abduct his victims .
now , this tells us that his social skills are most likely lacking
and he may not have the confidence to talk to women .
his confidence with killing , however , is growing .
he &apos;s gone from hesitant strikes in the victim &apos;s home
to painting the walls with blood .
our unsub is developing a taste for the kill .
and his victims share similar features and backgrounds .
and we believe that they represent someone
whom the unsub thinks has wronged him
and he &apos;s taking out his rage on them .
because the unsub shows signs of one neat aspect
and started killing suddenly and effectively with no break ,
we believe he was recently incarcerated or institutionalized .
look at men who got out a month or so ago .
their records will show a history of violence ,
anger toward women and or symbols of authority .
we need to warn all young women to be hypervigilant ,
especially in their online acquaintances ,
but also with service workers ,
maintenance staff , and deliverymen .
are we telling college girls
not to let people in uniforms into their homes ?
no , but tell them to double @-@ check i.d.s ,
call dispatch before they let anybody inside .
how do we avoid inciting panic ?
panic is inevitable , but we still need to keep everyone informed .
uniformed officers are posting warnings across campuses .
now , since the jenkins family found laurie online ,
we believe the unsub may be using similar methods--
profiles , job postings ,
anything that gives a little too much information
that the unsub could use to hunt his victims .
and time &apos;s not on our side .
we think that he &apos;s already got his next victim in his sights .
the account tracks back to an email address
he created yesterday morning ,
i.p. address leads to a public terminal .
that &apos;s where the trail ends .
what about at the jenkins house ?
he was tweeting with her prior to the assault .
the unsub hacked into the jenkins &apos; wi @-@ fi network .
pretty smart for a guy who &apos;s been locked up .
yeah , he has gotten good at covering his tracks .
how are you doing on a list of criminal records and releases ?
oh , right , that . ok .
i searched local college students , which is a lot ,
and i &apos;m a masochist , so i
went ahead and included military personnel
because san diego has a big naval and marine presence .
combine those two pools
and he &apos;s swimming in criminal infractions .
all right , filter out sexual assault and lewd behavior .
filtering at the speed of tech , sir .
and what about background financials on the victims ?
is there any evidence of jobs being performed under the table ?
actually , in all cases there were personal checks
deposited from several accounts , most under $ 100 .
all right , send a list of account holders , and , seaver ,
when you get them , start making phone calls .
what am i looking for ?
any victims who might have worked as babysitters .
yes , ma &apos;am .
how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;ve delivered the profile
and the locals are canvassing the area .
any leads ?
did you call for a field update ?
no .
i &apos;ve been reviewing your grief assessments ,
and they &apos;re incomplete .
how &apos;s that ?
yours isn &apos;t there .
my orders were to assess the team .
you don &apos;t think the mental state
of your team &apos;s leader is relevant ?
you need to talk to someone , too .
is that an order ?
if that &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll do it , yes .
ma &apos;am , with all due respect , we &apos;ve got 4 women dead
and we &apos;ll probably have another one by the morning .
find me when you get back .
she &apos;s relentless .
tell me about it .
can i help with anything ?
no , i &apos;m good . thanks .
all those dead girls look just like you , sweetheart .
you don &apos;t think i realize that ?
that last girl , i could be her sister .
what was that ?
kill . kill . kill !
ok , that is so not funny .
aw , come on , relax .
you set the alarm , right ?
um ... yeah , let &apos;s just see .
alarm ...
is ...
set .
kid &apos;s asleep .
come over ?
i can &apos;t . i got a paper due in the morning .
i &apos;ll write it for you .
really ?
yeah , just get over .
wait .
what &apos;s wrong , lily ?
what is it ?
something just triggered the alarm .
can you stay on the phone ?
yeah , ok .
lily . lily ?
oh , my god !
lily !
what &apos;s wrong , lily ?
sorry , um--
the ellisons are back . i gotta go .
sorry . we just came in from the garage .
no , sorry . i &apos;m just a little on edge .
we should have called first .
you &apos;re home early .
well , someone was bored .
says the man who snored and attracted the attention
of everyone around us .
how &apos;s the little one ?
still the best baby ever .
i put him to bed i think half an hour ago .
can you be here tomorrow morning at 8 : 00 instead of 9 : 00 ?
my meeting got moved up . yeah , sure .
do you want to just stay ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
thanks .
see you tomorrow ?
yep . bright and early .
did he get another babysitter ?
not just her .
who &apos;s that ?
amy ellison . she and her son are the sole survivors .
the housekeeper found them locked in the nursery .
they were locked in there all night ?
he broke the handle off the door .
i &apos;ll meet you guys inside .
mrs. ellison , we &apos;ll take him now and check his vitals .
i &apos;ll bring him right back to you .
hello , amy . my name &apos;s derek morgan . i &apos;m with the fbi .
i understand you &apos;ve been through a great ordeal .
i &apos;d just like to ask you a few questions if that &apos;s all right .
ok .
did you happen to see the man who came in your home ?
only for a couple seconds .
he was wearing a mask .
he rushed right at jake .
i--i couldn &apos;t--
it &apos;s ok .
take your time .
i ran to jake , but there was so much blood .
he grabbed lily and held the knife to her throat .
he locked me in the nursery with the baby .
did you hear anything while you were locked inside ?
screaming .
jake suffered multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen .
the sitter lily got the brunt of it .
this is the second time he struck inside someone else &apos;s home .
he &apos;s telling us something .
he &apos;s narrowing in on his ideal victimology .
babysitting somehow fits
into the scenario he &apos;s trying to recreate .
you know what ? he changed his m.o. as well .
he violated lily with a knife .
he hasn &apos;t shown aggressive sexual behavior up till now .
what &apos;s different ?
this is more personal .
she could be the one he &apos;s been after all along .
i don &apos;t know . this guy &apos;s meticulous .
he plans everything out .
then why didn &apos;t he know the ellisons were returning ?
i think he did . i mean , the unsub was watching the house .
he knew that they came home , but he just didn &apos;t care . he adapted .
he went after the biggest threat first .
he eliminated jake in order to gain control over lily and amy .
there are two initial points of attack ,
one in the hallway outside the nursery
and the other one here .
yet , both bodies ended up together .
look at the way they &apos;re posed ,
directly looking at each other .
he wanted them to watch each other die .
i think it &apos;s more than that .
this change in behavior could be the piece that we &apos;re missing .
this guy knew the ellisons were home , but he struck anyway .
he could have taken out the entire family ,
but he chose to spare the mother and the child . why ?
with the jenkins , the unsub actually fed the baby .
here , he spared the mother and locked her in a room with her son .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s protecting the children .
the addition of jake ellison
caused the unsub to change his methodology .
for the first time he posed the bodies ,
and he &apos;s also sexually violated one of the victims .
ok , we have a father posed to look at a dying babysitter
and a mother and child protected upstairs .
that &apos;s a pretty clear message .
garcia , search for local women who died in their early 30s .
and they &apos;re survived by a husband and at least one son .
go back 10 @-@ 15 years .
cross that with new marriage licenses
filed by surviving husbands .
the unsub &apos;s always been troubled , garcia ,
so look for youthful offenders
who would have fit into the sociopathic triad .
ok , i &apos;ve got 30 matches ,
which points to a disturbing social phenomenon
and does not help us narrow this down .
ok , so cross @-@ reference that
with your list of newly @-@ released inmates and mental patients .
ok , i &apos;ve got a few .
what about ... here &apos;s one .
greg phinney , chula vista .
he was put into juvie when he was 13 for ...
threatening his stepmom with a knife .
what do we know about the stepmother ?
kate jones , aka the second mrs . phinney .
married greg &apos;s father a year after greg &apos;s mother
was killed in a car accident .
greg was 11 at the time .
mr. phinney died 4 weeks ago .
is there any evidence that kate worked in the phinney home
before the mother &apos;s death ?
oh , the plot solidifies .
kate cited additional income as caregiver
on her tax returns when she was a college student .
payments trace back to the phinneys .
kate filed numerous reports against greg for violent behavior ,
experimentation on animals .
greg &apos;s father finally put the kibosh on things when he was 17,
had him institutionalized . greg was released 2 weeks ago .
just before the killings started .
garcia , where &apos;s greg phinney now ?
yeah , that &apos;s a good question .
oh , dear--
hello , kate .
greg phinney , fbi . open the door !
he &apos;s not in here . the bedroom &apos;s clear .
baby girl , can you tell me why greg phinney &apos;s laptop
has an employee login screen ?
well , lover , i have been doing some digging .
did you know that he &apos;s been working
part @-@ time as a data entry clerk
at the &quot; san diego register &quot; ?
if he was in an institution , where did he get time to find a job ?
uh , he didn &apos;t even have to look .
this job is part of his work @-@ release program .
and 20 hours of internet privileges will go a long way .
that &apos;s how he finds his victims . he browses the classifieds .
did he have access to the customers &apos; personal information ?
oh , honey , he entered it .
that must be kate phinney .
well , he &apos;s obviously built up the confidence to confront her .
garcia .
reading your mind . calling the others .
stop , please !
do you feel that ?
of course i do .
not the pain .
do you feel your heart starting to beat a little faster ?
it &apos;s not your mind panicking .
it &apos;s your body . it &apos;s fighting to adapt .
what , am i one of your animals now ?
no .
i didn &apos;t want them to suffer .
no--no , no !
greg &apos;s not at home , so he &apos;s probably already at kate &apos;s house .
kate &apos;s the object of his hostility .
he &apos;s gonna take his time .
let &apos;s light him up . i &apos;m sure he knows we &apos;re coming .
they &apos;re coming for you .
they &apos;re gonna be too late .
dave , take some uniforms and find the back door .
i &apos;m gonna try to get inside and talk to him .
you think that &apos;s gonna work ?
i don &apos;t think kate gets out of this any other way .
your father , he wouldn &apos;t want this .
you have no right to talk about him .
he was my husband , greg .
he was my dad .
you told him to lock me up .
no .
you made me do it .
no , i didn &apos;t . you did .
you--you--what you did to our puppy .
what you did to the neighbor &apos;s cat .
i mean , he knew what you were .
shut up !
you ruined everything .
no .
i took care of you .
we wanted the best for you .
sending me away ?
what , so i wasn &apos;t your problem anymore ?
what ? !
greg phinney , this is agent aaron hotchner .
i need to talk to you about your demands
so you can let kate go .
i don &apos;t have any demands .
i ju--i want-- i want her to pay for what she &apos;s done .
what has she done ?
she took my dad .
she &apos;s a whore , and she ruined us .
greg , i think this is more about your dad than it is about kate .
no . no , no . she-- she got me locked up .
your dad put you away .
don &apos;t turn this on him .
greg , i need to ask you a very important question .
do you want to live ?
what do you mean ?
i think you do . and if so , you need to let me in the house .
otherwise i can &apos;t guarantee that you &apos;re gonna walk out of there .
uh , you can come to the door .
seaver , i want you to come in with me . leave your firearm here .
be compassionate and sympathetic to him .
let him tell you how kate betrayed him
and how much you understand his devastation .
i never said that you could bring in anyone else .
i know , but i thought if we talked inside
we could work this out ourselves .
are you some kind of a negotiator ?
no guns .
no guns .
ok .
close the door .
all right .
stand over there .
you need to put the gun down .
we need to get out of here .
is that gonna happen ?
as long as you &apos;ve got a gun ,
if one of the agents outside has a clear shot ,
he &apos;ll take it .
i don &apos;t have line of sight .
we &apos;re ready to move when you do .
tell me what you want , greg .
you know , i don &apos;t want to get locked up again .
don &apos;t you really want kate to apologize
for making your dad forget your mom ?
no , i didn &apos;t do that , though .
unless the next words out of your mouth are &quot; i &apos;m sorry , &quot;
i don &apos;t want to hear anything else from you .
i understand , greg .
i do .
she took care of you .
you trusted her .
and then she betrayed you as soon as your mother was gone .
it must have crushed you when kate married your dad .
how did it make you feel , greg ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you felt betrayed , didn &apos;t you , greg ?
ask her the question , greg .
go ahead .
ask her .
why not me ?
why not me ?
answer him , kate .
b @-@ b @-@ because
you were just a ...
a boy .
but i loved you .
i loved you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
but i loved you , kate !
don &apos;t kill me , greg , please !
bring in backup .
come on , let &apos;s go !
agent seaver .
what you said in there ,
is it true ?
did he really do all this because of me ?
no .
i had to be aggressive towards you
in order to gain greg &apos;s trust .
none of this is your fault .
then why ?
greg was always a troubled child .
losing his mother and then his father
made him even more unstable .
sometimes we do everything right and we still lose .
greg was a sociopath and there &apos;s nothing you could have done
to change that .
thank you .
good work , agent .
thanks .
nice job , kid .
thank you .
&quot; every journey into the past
&quot; is complicated by delusions ,
false memories , false namings of real events . &quot;
adrienne rich .
you wanted to see me ?
good job in san diego .
thank you .
despite a challenging year ,
your team seems to be functioning surprisingly well .
but ?
no .
i agree with your assessment
and so does the director .
why , uh , why the interest in the well @-@ being of my team ?
the director has some concerns .
what kind of concerns ?
there &apos;s a chance that i might need your help ,
and i want you to be in a position to assist .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m just dealing with a few things right now .
what is it ?
i might have to be away for a few months .
i &apos;m not asking you to step away from your duties ,
but i might need you to supervise some departments .
whatever you need . of course .
i &apos;ll be available by phone .
would you ...
do you want to talk about it ?
so you can assess me ?
