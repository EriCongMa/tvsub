oh , good job .
oh , yes , such a beautiful day .
let &apos;s go have brunch somewhere outside
where i can wear my new sunglasses , huh ?
ew , gross ! what happened to you ?
i don &apos;t feel good .
i &apos;m hot .
now i &apos;m cold .
oh , no .
and we have that concert tonight .
i know , but , honey ,
that &apos;s the furthest thing from my mind , okay ?
why me ? !
we had amazing seats for lady gaga ,
and he gets sick .
i &apos;d been looking forward to that concert for months .
it &apos;s the one gay cliche i allow myself .
no more fighting !
no more fighting for the rest of your lives ,
you are not allowed to yell at each other .
but you &apos;re allowed to yell at us ?
yes , alex , i am ,
because i feed you and i clothe you
and i pay the mortgage .
pretty sure old dad deserves a shout @-@ out right about now .
phil !
sorry .
should &apos;ve taken the temperature of the room first .
what &apos;s up ?
luke and manny barged into our room
while we were changing , the little pervs !
can i just say , in europe this would be no big deal .
yeah . you can see me in my underwear whenever you want .
here , i &apos;ll make it even .
no , hey , luke , luke , luke !
mom !
luke , keep your pants on , okay ? !
and , girls , stop getting so hysterical over everything !
come on ! now , grow up a little !
i need things to start changing around here ,
or i will change things , okay ?
there will be no more tv and no internet
and no whatever else i can think of .
may i have a word with you , phil ?
i &apos;d rather not .
what was that ?
nothing .
phil , you sold me out behind my back .
no ! it &apos;s just that sometimes you can get a little intense ,
and i feel like i need to swoop in
to let the kids know they &apos;re still loved .
i could kick you .
honey , these are just the parts that we &apos;re playing .
am i wrong , or has it been working ?
i feel like it &apos;s been working .
i &apos;m tired of being the bad cop .
you need to discipline them sometime
and let me swoop in with all the love .
shouldn &apos;t we just stick with the stuff we &apos;re good at ?
oh , my god ! this bathroom is disgusting !
the girls told me they would clean it days ago .
i can &apos;t yell at them about it one more time , phil .
you handle it .
i would , but i promised luke and manny
i &apos;d take them go @-@ karting for their good report cards .
what was good about luke &apos;s report card ?
he didn &apos;t lose it .
let me take them .
yes , let me take them . you stay here .
hound the girls about cleaning up this mess ,
and i will take luke to do something fun .
but ...
i want to go go @-@ karting .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
this is happening .
boys !
hey , guys , guess who &apos;s taking you go @-@ karting today .
me .
why ?
are we in trouble ?
no ! you &apos;re not in trouble .
today &apos;s just all about having fun !
and you know what ? go @-@ karting &apos;s just the beginning .
what else are we doing ?
whatever you want .
i want to bring dad .
well , tough . you can &apos;t .
he &apos;s doing something else .
goodbye . we will be back in a few hours .
oh , whoa ! where you guys going ?
i am taking alex to the movies ,
and then i &apos;m going to the mall .
how fun ! that sounds like fun , doesn &apos;t it , phil ?
i &apos;m not much of a shopper , but it would depend on --
clean bathroom .
girls ...
how about you clean your bathroom before you go , huh ?
it &apos;d really help your mom out .
oh , no . it &apos;s not about what mom wants .
you mom is cool ,
very cool with whatever .
it &apos;s about what dad wants .
dad wants to go go @-@ karting .
i would really like it if you would clean your bathroom .
but my movie !
why do we have to do it now ?
because claire says so .
because i say so .
and because i &apos;m your dad .
and i &apos;m older than you ,
and i call the shots around here .
right ?
yes , you do .
this is so unfair !
come on , guys , let &apos;s go have some fun !
ow ! you &apos;re hurting me .
oh , you &apos;re fine !
have fun , guys .
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
so ...
how does this usually start ?
good morning , mr. pritchett .
how you doing , sport ?
i didn &apos;t know who that was . i never do .
at least once a month ,
i find a total stranger sitting in my kitchen .
gloria collects every kind of stray
looking for work , money , you name it .
she &apos;s got a big heart .
it &apos;s the one thing i &apos;d like to change about her .
hey , a dog . that &apos;s new .
that was mr. pritchett .
oh , jay , there you are . come .
i want to introduce you to guillermo .
just met him . really hit it off .
honey , keep it under a hundred bucks ,
you don &apos;t even have to tell me .
i &apos;m going golfing .
no .
he &apos;s a very nice man that works at the grocery store
and needs a little bit of business advice .
oh , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
i thought he was just some nut
who lived behind the dry cleaner &apos;s .
oh , that &apos;s the guy we bought corrective shoes for last month .
jay , he knows how successful you are ,
and all he wants is an hour of your t-- half @-@ hour .
10 minutes . i promise him !
honey , i love you ,
but why do you drag me into these things ?
you &apos;ve got to learn to say no to people .
fine . ask me if you can go golfing now .
other people .
all i want is , when i go to bed at night ,
to be laying next to a man that is generous and giving .
and that man doesn &apos;t necessarily need to be you .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
okay . guillermo !
do you want me to move the waste basket closer to you ?
oh , no . it &apos;s fine where it is .
really ?
&apos;cause the bed kind of looks like a rose parade float .
thank you for taking care of me .
well , what else would i be doing ?
um , seeing lady gaga , that &apos;s what .
so , uh , cam , you know , i hate to bring this up ,
but what are we gonna do about that concert ?
what do you mean ?
well , you know , we were both looking forward to going .
you were looking forward to going .
i was really looking forward to going .
and i just -- i @-@ i hate to see those tickets go to waste .
i know , i know .
but what are our options ?
we could both go to the concert .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
uh , well , we could sell the tickets online .
but there &apos;s that craigslist killer .
oh , what to do ? what to do ?
what to do ? what to do ? what to do ?
other options , other options .
mitchell , are you hinting
that you want to go to that concert without me ?
no ! no ! not in a million years !
but that &apos;s very sweet of you to offer .
i didn &apos;t offer.- oh , really ?
&apos;cause that just seems like something that you would say
&quot; you go , i &apos;ll be fine .
you spent all the money on the tickets ,
and i &apos;m just gonna lie in bed anyways . &quot;
that &apos;s classic cam .
i &apos;m just so weak .
okay , good .
you know what ? it &apos;s settled .
we &apos;re just gonna put this whole
&quot; you insisting i go to the concert without you &quot;
thing behind us .
you know what ?
what ?
can i get one of my little pudding cups ?
yes , you can . yes .
you eat the pudding ,
and i &apos;ll eat the tickets .
thanks for your dining , mr.pritchett.
but after you hearing my presentation ,
you will be thanking me .
well , you &apos;ve got confidence . i admire that .
he admires that , guillermo .
you &apos;re doing great . keep going .
are you aware that last year ,
americans spent $ 40 billion on dog training ?
well , that &apos;s not true .
i was surprised as you are .
no , you were surprised because it &apos;s not true .
shh ! go on , guillermo .
what is this multibillion @-@ dollar industry missing ?
multibillion dollars .
i have devised a revolutionary way to communicate --
listen , i hate to interrupt your big pitch ,
but your dog is chewing my pillow .
this is fantastic .
it &apos;s not fantastic for my pillow .
it &apos;s a perfect opportunity for me to demonstrate
the good doggie bad doggie training system .
we &apos;re in !
wait , slow down .
what are we gonna do about the pillow situation ?
watch , and be amazed .
stella here is being a bad doggie .
stella , let go . bad dog , bad dog .
bad dog . and what does a bad dog get ?
a bad @-@ doggie treat .
wait a minute .
you give her a treat for doing something bad ?
ah , a bad @-@ doggie treat .
when she is good , she gets the good @-@ doggie treat .
brilliant ! we &apos;re going to be rich !
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
what is the difference between a bad @-@ doggie treat
and the good @-@ doggie treat ?
bacon . the bad @-@ doggie treat is very bland .
but she seems like she likes it .
wait till you see the good @-@ doggie treat .
stella , sit .
now a good @-@ doggie treat .
okay , uh , she &apos;s still full from the bad @-@ doggie treat .
but there you have it --
the good doggie bad doggie training system .
welcome to the ground floor .
actually , she &apos;s peeing on the ground floor .
quick , quick , give her a bad @-@ doggie treat !
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me . is this a bad time ?
no , i &apos;m just in the car .
okay , i &apos;m having a moral dilemma .
we have tickets for lady gaga tonight , but cam &apos;s sick .
i &apos;ll take them .
wait , you don &apos;t even like concerts .
yes , i do . i &apos;m fun now .
claire , they said we have to be at least 13
to ride the fast ones .
they &apos;re 13 . it &apos;s fine .
this is very confusing .
at movie theaters , she says i &apos;m 11 .
can we get back to me ?
what ?
does it make me a horrible person
that i kind of want to go without him ?
well , how sick is he ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s sick .
you know , they &apos;re not gonna make a lifetime movie about him .
well , what &apos;s he like when you &apos;re sick ?
cam , i think i can walk to the kitchen .
he &apos;s okay .
you should go .
you know what i learned today ?
you can &apos;t wait around
for somebody to give you something you want .
sometimes you just have to take it .
oh , i &apos;m gonna feel so guilty , though .
you &apos;ll resent him if you stay .
so , how about this -- you stay home
and take care of him -- soup , foot rubs ,
you blow his nose .
ew .
he &apos;s so lucky to have you .
and then tonight , right before the concert , you say ,
&quot; cam , i love you , but i really want to go . &quot;
he &apos;ll say fine .
you drop lily off at our house , and it &apos;s great .
drivers , start your engines .
i &apos;m putting you on speaker .
what are you doing ?
making my kids love me !
drivers , ready . three , two , one !
you &apos;re going down , delgado !
like this !
we &apos;re finished cleaning the bathroom .
we &apos;re leaving .
see ? that didn &apos;t take too long .
thank you , girls .
now , go and have a good time , all right ?
bye .
see ? you don &apos;t need all the conflict .
note to claire -- if you want intense family drama ,
rent &quot; spy kids . &quot;
they save their parents &apos; lives .
you think they would &apos;ve done that
if they got yelled at all the time ?
sweet and sour chicken !
girls !
get back h-- got to fix that step .
girls !
did he just yell ?
drive !
i &apos;m trying !
you girls get back here right now !
pretend you don &apos;t hear him .
i know you can hear me !
oh , my god , he &apos;s heading straight for the car !
oh , my god ! aah !
stop this car !
we &apos;re sorry , dad !
we couldn &apos;t hear you !
no more lies !
you poked the bear , girls !
you poked him !
in closing , the only real question is ,
after you invest in good doggie bad doggie ,
how will we spend all our money ?
in handbags !
no , vacation !
i know ! a home gym !
all right , guillermo , your ambition is infectious .
clearly my wife needs to be inoculated .
but i &apos;m gonna be blunt .
ay , no , no , you &apos;re not going to
yes , i am .
now , you wanted my honest business advice , right ?
very much .
here it is .
your idea is not good .
no , what jay means is that when --
no , what i mean is it stinks .
now , that &apos;s nothing against you .
you &apos;ve got charm ,
you &apos;ve got ambition , and that &apos;s great .
what you need is a better idea .
but i don &apos;t have a better idea .
any idea would be a better idea .
your honesty is refreshing .
gracias .
ay , you made him cry .
he &apos;s not crying .
you &apos;re not crying , are you ?
no .
a little .
it &apos;s just five years of my life are for nothing .
five ? five years ?
ay , guillermo , i &apos;m sorry .
why don &apos;t you stay for lunch ?
and -- and we can all brainstorm your next idea .
really ? thank you , gloria .
i go put stella in the car .
i don &apos;t want her ruining any more of your beautiful things .
gracias .
bad dog .
why were you so tough with him ?
he &apos;s very sensitive .
did you think that was a good idea ?
of course not !
but i &apos;m nice , and i put on the sugar jacket .
sugar coating is not gonna help him .
he needed to hear what i said to him ,
even if it hurt a little bit .
he &apos;s gonna thank me one day .
ay ! guillermo ! now i have to apologize .
accepted .
not to you !
what are you gonna get , luke ?
i want a cheeseburger .
yeah !
and i can &apos;t decide between french fries or onion rings .
get them both !
how about you , manny ?
um , do you have a skinless grilled chicken breast ?
what , are you going to the ball , cinderella ?
live a little .
i know claire was trying to be fun ,
but that crossed the line .
anything else ? who wants a milkshake ?
milkshake ? milkshake ? three milkshakes .
i didn &apos;t really want a milkshake .
but after what she said to manny ,
i didn &apos;t want to risk it .
mom , i don &apos;t feel good .
did you finish your milkshake ?
i think that was the problem .
look who &apos;s a doctor now .
maybe it was the pie .
oh , he &apos;s fine . hey .
hey , who likes roller coasters ?
i need a bag .
no . no , you &apos;re not gonna be sick , luke .
we &apos;re having fun .
okay .
no , i really need a bag .
take the lid off the cup .
i &apos;m starving .
me too . say something .
um , dad ? we haven &apos;t had lunch yet .
neither have half the kids in africa .
stop yapping and get back to work .
why is he taping our laptops shut ?
because he &apos;s out of his mind .
i &apos;m not out of my mind !
you took advantage , and you lost your computer privileges .
oh , come on , dad . we said we &apos;re sorry .
plus i can &apos;t get the stupid drain unclogged , anyway .
stick that hanger down there .
ew , no !
well , it &apos;s either that or we cut off all your hair ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what caused the problem -- thoughts ?
good , because after you finish this room ,
you &apos;re gonna clean my bathroom , too ,
and you know how gross i can be .
dad ! no !
oh , my gosh .
oh , my gosh !
ew ! gross !
all right .
aah ! settle down . it &apos;s hair .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m not cut out for this .
i spent all day nursing cam .
ohh . hey , could you do the right one now ?
you mean the one we started with ? sure .
i made soup . i made tea .
finally , it was the moment of truth .
cam , you know , i was thinking that ...
cam , you can say no ,
but i was thinking about maybe going to that concert .
thank you . you &apos;re the best . i love you .
hey , you &apos;re back . what happened with your friend ?
he &apos;s fine . you were right .
he did appreciate your honesty .
how about that ?
he &apos;s gonna make big changes to his life .
good .
he &apos;s going back to school .
that means he has to go back to live with his sister ,
so that means that he had to get rid of the dog .
but he &apos;s so much more realistic now .
see that ? mm .
and there &apos;s a lesson in there for you , too ,
&apos;cause sometimes things go better when you just say no .
no , no , no . what did you do ?
ay ! he was going to take her to the pound .
but that &apos;s his business .
ay , but look at her little face !
no .
you don &apos;t even want a dog .
i know . i have a problem .
oh , crap , that &apos;s manny .
if he sees the dog , it &apos;s all over .
i go lock the door .
oh , and that &apos;s the solution ?
manny sleeps in the backyard till the dog dies of old age ?
hey , guys . i &apos;m home .
boy , i think claire &apos;s working through some stuff , because --
oh , my gosh !
you got me a dog because of my perfect report card ?
gloria ?
sorry , papi , no .
the dog lives somewhere else ,
which is where she &apos;s going right now .
text me the address .
okay .
can i at least take a moment with her to tell her goodbye ?
tell her goodbye ? you just met her .
i &apos;m so sorry .
luke , honey , come back . i said i was sorry .
i &apos;m 12 . i need limits !
what happened ?
oh , i made them drive too fast
and eat like vikings ,
and then luke threw up all over the car .
i got to go clean that up .
no , you don &apos;t . girls !
grab your buckets and meet me by the car !
they don &apos;t have to do that .
they do if i say so .
i &apos;m sorry .
i swear i just told you to grab your buckets !
we haven &apos;t eaten all day .
we &apos;re hungry .
well , you won &apos;t be in a minute .
honey , you haven &apos;t fed them all day ?
they &apos;re monsters , claire --
deceitful , manipulative monsters --
and they need to be broken .
he &apos;s crazy !
you know what ? ! mom &apos;s the crazy one !
she ran over my hand .
we were having fun !
girls , go to the kitchen .
get something to eat .
phil , honey , this isn &apos;t working .
listen to me , you are not a good bad cop ,
and i am a very bad good cop .
we need things to go back to the way they were .
yeah .
yeah .
i feel really shaky .
i don &apos;t like being you .
nobody does .
going somewhere ?
cam ! you &apos;re up .
didn &apos;t count on that , did you ?
are you dropping lily off at your sister &apos;s ,
or is she taking my ticket ?
okay , first of all , how are you standing ?
you drank enough of that cough syrup
to put down a grizzly .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s grisly .
that is your behavior .
well , it &apos;s just a good thing i &apos;m finding out now ,
instead of when i &apos;m old and sick and really need you .
better start saving for some sort of home @-@ healthcare plan ,
&apos;cause i &apos;d hate for my broken hip and subsequent pneumonia
to interfere with your evening plans .
okay , cam , no , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right .
i have no defense . i am terrible .
and the thing is , i knew i was terrible ,
and i was going anyway .
i think maybe i tried to justify it
by saying we &apos;re two different people .
and you &apos;re more of a caregiver ,
and i have ... other strengths .
and that &apos;s what makes us such a good couple , you know ?
but ... no , no .
it &apos;s a cop @-@ out .
and i &apos;ve been very selfish ,
and i need to do better , and i will .
i swear on lily &apos;s ...
... diaper bag .
ah , no place to go but up , huh ?
don &apos;t look at me like that .
we all got problems .
this ain &apos;t gonna work , sweetie .
that look ain &apos;t gonna work on me . come on .
come on . let &apos;s go .
i know it &apos;s old @-@ fashioned , but i like a strong man ,
a man that can say no when i can &apos;t .
not a word .
but instead , i have jay .
i &apos;m strong . but look at this face .
maybe we are the way we are
because of the people we &apos;re with .
or maybe we just pick the people we need .
however it works , when you find each other ,
you should never let go .
do you two need some time alone ?
i must &apos;ve dozed off .
yeah , you were out for quite a while .
what have you been up to ?
i &apos;ve just been sitting here , watching you .
well i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
okay .
thanks for staying home with me .
well , you know ,
in sickness and in health , right ?
you &apos;re still blinking , sweetie .
oh , no . oh , gosh .
well , this is-- this is funny .
i &apos;m gonna tell you the funny thing
