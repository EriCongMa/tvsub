all right , it &apos;s a new day . that stuff about rachel ?
you don &apos;t feel that now . it was crazy . you &apos;re fine . you &apos;re better than fine .
you are , as your friend tony would say , &quot; great ! &quot;
everything &apos;s normal . she &apos;s just your friend , rachel .
your friend , rachel . your friend . rachel .
hi , sweetie .
hey , it &apos;s your girlfriend , rachel !
the.one.where.chandler.takes.a.bath
are you .. ? are you high ?
i just had the most amazing bath .
really ? i don &apos;t like baths .
you like them with me .
honey , it &apos;s not the bath i enjoy . it &apos;s the wet , naked lady .
baths are so relaxing .
really ? what do you do ?
you just sit in there , stewing in your own filth .
how dirty do you think i am ?
if you had some candles and bubbles and music ,
you would love it .
it would take all of your stress away .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 on a wednesday and i &apos;m watching road rules .
how stressed do you think i am ?
hey , chandler . you got a minute ? i really need to talk to you .
oh , yeah . is this a cold @-@ pizza talk or a leftover @-@ meat loaf talk ?
well , neither .
oh , my god , what &apos;s up ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just ..
lately , i &apos;ve been feeling ..
okay , here &apos;s what it is .
you know what ? i feel a lot better . thanks .
no . come back here and talk to me , mon frere .
who ?
just come back .
okay .
you and monica , friends for a long time .
and sure , there are rules . but then you went to london .
but that &apos;s different . there are rules there too , you know what i mean ?
do you ?
it was different for you guys . you were both in the same place , right ?
in london ?
yeah .
yes , when monica and i were in london , we were both in london .
you know what . this is a bad idea . forget all about it .
and listen , do me a favor , this conversation between you and me .
if that .
how do i keep losing at tic @-@ tac @-@ toe ?
oh , no , no , honey . my circle always stays in the middle .
oh , ross , don &apos;t forget we have that doctor &apos;s appointment tomorrow .
to find out the sex of the baby ?
no . we don &apos;t wanna know .
all we care about is that it &apos;s happy and healthy .
yep , happy and healthy . and cute .
and smart . with an aptitude for science .
popular .
are you two talking about the same baby ?
hey , have you thought of names ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;ve come up with a bunch .
really ? me too .
me too .
really ?
if it &apos;s a girl , phoebe . and if it &apos;s a boy , pheebo .
maybe . but it wouldn &apos;t hurt to have a backup , you know ?
rach , what were you thinking ?
okay .
i was thinking if it &apos;s a girl ..
how about sandrene ? it &apos;s french .
that &apos;s a really pretty name for an industrial solvent .
okay , fine . what do you have ?
it &apos;s for a boy .
i know it &apos;s a little out there , but ..
darwin .
oh , my god . our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard .
yeah , by sandrene .
you &apos;re saying that because i said no to your name .
i &apos;m really , really not .
how about you each get five vetoes ?
that sounds fair .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll need it . check this out .
if it &apos;s a girl , rain .
veto .
why ?
rain ? &quot; hi , my name is rain .
i have my own kiln , and my dress is made out of wheat . &quot;
i know her !
i bought a homemade soap from her at a dead show !
okay . how about for a guy , thatcher ?
why do you hate our child ?
fine , you go .
okay . james .
but only if it &apos;s a girl .
veto .
i like ruth . what about ruth ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . are we having an 89 @-@ year @-@ old ?
how about dayton ?
veto . stewart .
veto . sawyer .
veto . helen .
veto .
is it me , or is veto starting to sound really good ?
boy , do i have a surprise for you .
sex on the balcony ?
no . but someone &apos;s not gonna get over that idea .
what is it ?
i drew you a bath .
i don &apos;t like baths . could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony ?
please . will you just try it for me . i used all my best stuff .
i lit candles , i put on music . i used bath salts , plus bubble bath .
and got you this little plastic navy ship ! so it &apos;s a boy bath .
this does butch it up a bit .
i swear , if you try it , you will love it .
if i do this , can we at least discuss sex on the balcony ?
absolutely .
but i know how that discussion &apos;s gonna go .
all right , this isn &apos;t so bad . i like the flowery smell .
which is okay , because i &apos;ve got my boat .
i can actually feel my tension just melting away .
i could fall asleep in here .
i could drown in here .
drowning .
so ?
oh , my god .
i told you you were a bath person . hey , maybe i can give you a facial .
i &apos;m gonna need a bigger boat .
i don &apos;t think you had an open mind about the name ruth .
i mean , come on , little ruthie geller ? how cute is that ?
oh , my god , i can practically hear the mahjong tiles .
okay . all your tests look fine . are you interested in knowing the sex of the baby ?
no , we &apos;re not .
but you have it right there in that file ?
you could tell us whether it &apos;s a boy or a girl ?
dayton or sandrene ? phoebe or pheebo ?
that &apos;s right . but if you don &apos;t wanna know ..
no , we wanna wait . right ?
right . right .
oh , i &apos;ll be right back .
i know it &apos;s really not my place ..
but please don &apos;t name your child pheebo .
so which of these babies do you think is the ugliest ?
what ? rach , come on , that &apos;s terrible .
they &apos;re babies . they &apos;re all beautiful .
third one from the left ?
yeah . why is it staring at me ?
i think it knows i &apos;m talking about it . don &apos;t you .. ? you &apos;re looking !
i didn &apos;t !
i saw you !
fine , i did , but i didn &apos;t see anything .
shame on you ! ugly baby judges you !
okay . but listen to me , i didn &apos;t ..
don &apos;t tell me ! i don &apos;t wanna know !
i couldn &apos;t even if i wanted to , because i don &apos;t know !
i swear i didn &apos;t see anything ! i don &apos;t want to know . it was just a momentary lapse .
momentary lapse ? don &apos;t you have any self @-@ control ?
okay . a couple months late on the lecture , ross .
hello ?
i &apos;m in the bathroom . can you come in here ? i think there &apos;s something wrong .
you know what ? i think i &apos;ll wait out here .
i &apos;m in the bathtub .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i drew my own bath , but i did it wrong .
the water &apos;s tepid , the salt didn &apos;t dissolve and is now lodged places .
and the scents i used don &apos;t compliment each other . eucalyptus and chamomile ?
what ?
bath salts .
they &apos;re starting to effervesce .
it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s interesting .
okay . let &apos;s talk about something else .
yeah . sure . so , what was going on with you today ?
i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey .
he was talking about rules and right and wrong .
i had the same conversation .
you did ? what was he talking about ?
he hasn &apos;t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth .
that was a long night .
all right , let &apos;s break this down . what exactly did he say to you ?
he was talking about rules and looking at people differently .
he didn &apos;t say that to me .
what &apos;d he tell you ?
he was asking questions about you , me and london .
and the glue that holds this all together , the rules .
okay . so you , me and london .
looking at people differently .
maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .
but what &apos;d he mean by &quot; rules &quot; ?
wait . he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in .
because he was looking at her differently .
and phoebe is his friend .
so he thinks that would be breaking the rules .
my god , he wants to do it with phoebe in london !
you guys ?
just a minute !
that &apos;s mrs. tribbiani .
you don &apos;t say anything .
why would i say anything ?
that two of our friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives ?
they would have me to thank . then we could all start having babies !
i &apos;m not gonna let you say anything .
you just stay here .
oh , god !
hey , monica , i brought back your iron .
oh , you had that ? i thought i lost it . i got a new one a month ago .
oh , just as well . i broke this one .
what ?
nothing .
i really shouldn &apos;t say . i &apos;m really not supposed to .
fine .
it &apos;s a humdinger .
well , then it &apos;s really too bad that you can &apos;t tell me .
somebody likes you !
is it chandler ?
no !
then tell him to stop staring .
it &apos;s joey .
really ? joey ? you don &apos;t say .
is it something you &apos;d be interested in ?
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
you know , i mean , on the one hand , &quot; mother , may i ? &quot;
but , you know , on the other hand ..
no . no , i can &apos;t . we &apos;re friends .
oh , no . i don &apos;t wanna risk what we have .
i guess that makes sense . you think you &apos;re gonna talk to him ?
sure . i mean , it &apos;s joey . i don &apos;t want him to get hurt .
well , i must say , i am on fire ! first chandler , now joey .
not chandler . just joey .
sure .
you know what ? i &apos;ve been thinking about it . i &apos;m coming around on the name ruth .
i think i would actually consider naming our child that .
rach , i can &apos;t tell you how much that means to me .
wait a minute .
wait a minute . you hated the name ruth . why would you change your mind ?
unless you know we &apos;re never gonna have to use it .
you did see . you know it &apos;s a boy !
i didn &apos;t see anything . i actually changed my mind about the name .
i don &apos;t think so . you &apos;re giving me ruth ..
so you get to name him when it &apos;s a boy .
that &apos;s when you &apos;ll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .
i would .. sequoia !
veto .
fine .
unless ..
you anticipated that i would figure all this out ..
and you know that it actually is a girl .
and you really do want her to be named ruth .
well , i &apos;m not falling for that ! okay ? ruth is off the table !
but , ross , you want the name ruth .
not like this !
what &apos;s up ?
joey , i know .
what ?
i know .
what ?
i know about your feelings .
oh , my god , you do ?
i &apos;m sorry . things worked out for chandler and monica , but that &apos;s rare .
i know . and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys .
i mean , it &apos;s rachel , for god &apos;s sakes .
for god &apos;s sakes , it &apos;s rachel !
i know ! she &apos;s not only my friend , she &apos;s my pregnant friend .
she &apos;s my pregnant friend who &apos;s ross &apos; ex !
yeah , that &apos;s rachel .
beat me over the head with it .
what am i gonna do ? i keep trying to get rid of these feelings .
i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i don &apos;t like about her .
you wanna hear it ?
yeah .
&quot; she made me switch to light mayo . &quot; that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s all i got !
you know what ? tastes the same and my pants fit better .
joey , i think you &apos;re getting upset for nothing . this is probably just a crush .
you think ?
absolutely . you get this rush of feelings , but then it goes away .
yeah , just a crush . that &apos;s all this is . it &apos;s a crush !
i &apos;m joey . i don &apos;t get deep feelings .
there you go . crushes happen all the time .
i know i &apos;ve had them for all you guys . except for ross and chandler .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had them for us .
not really .
throw me a bone here .
so i called the doctor .
now we both know the sex of the baby .
what ?
that &apos;s right . the student has become the master .
ross , i swear . i don &apos;t know .
oh , come on , you know it &apos;s a girl .
a what ?
you really didn &apos;t know ?
we &apos;re having a girl ?
no .
that &apos;s what you said .
no .
you said girl .
yes . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m not ! we &apos;re having a girl !
sometimes i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s with you , but still , we &apos;re having a girl !
i know ! you know what ? i &apos;m putting ruth back on the table .
yes , we &apos;ll have ourselves a little baby ruth .
permission to veto .
yes , please .
do i smell essential oils ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna take a bath . i was just gonna get a magazine .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
leaving my troubles behind ?
i know that you &apos;re new at this , but this is unacceptable bath decorum .
it &apos;s so hard to care when you &apos;re this relaxed .
okay , fine . you can have the bath , but i am taking your boat .
now you &apos;re just a girl in a tub .
hi , bubbles . manly .
i thought i would drop by and let you know how it went .
you told her ?
she pulled it out of me ! she &apos;s like a conversational wizard !
how did it go ?
you were wrong . he doesn &apos;t like me .
how would you like it if i sent you to lee majors &apos; house ..
and i told you he liked you and you went there ..
and you found out that he didn &apos;t like you . how would you feel ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d care .
really ? lee majors is hot .
hello ?
we &apos;re in the bathroom !
why ?
because it &apos;s a relaxing and enjoyable time !
what are you guys doing in here ?
oh , my god .
a friend he &apos;s looking at differently , but it &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s rachel !
you like rachel ?
it &apos;s no big deal . phoebe and i talked . it &apos;s a crush . it &apos;ll go away .
dude , you gotta rearrange your bubbles .
mazel tov .
ross and i were looking for you .
what are we all doing in here ? oh , my .
honey , cover it up with the boat .
it &apos;s not an aircraft carrier .
hello ?
we &apos;re all in here , and we &apos;d love for you to join us !
well , hey ! what &apos;s going on ? oh , cool boat . oh , no .
did you tell them ?
no . i was waiting for you .
tell us what ?
we &apos;re having a girl .
oh , wow ! really ?
i &apos;ll get you later .
all right . it &apos;s a new day . and it &apos;s just a crush .
that &apos;s all . just a little crush .
all that worrying i was doing ? that was crazy .
like my friend the bird here would say , &quot; it was cuckoo ! &quot;
everything &apos;s gonna be fine . it &apos;s just a crush .
hi , sweetie .
i love you .
it &apos;s nice to do this together , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah . and what you &apos;re doing feels so good .
i &apos;m not touching you .
you &apos;re not ?
it &apos;s the salts .
oh , sweet lord , new realms of pleasure .
