welcome to the williamsburg diner .
your lifespan just decreased by one meal .
would you like to order now
or after that galaxy is destroyed ?
oh , dude , i can hold up one finger , too ,
and trust me ; it won &apos;t be that one .
booth one is all yours .
if i wanted to deal with a guy
who won &apos;t even acknowledge my existence ,
i &apos;d track down my father .
makeup needs to complement the personality .
sorry , i wasn &apos;t listening .
mr. eye queen &apos;s about to show me how to pluck my eyebrows .
finally .
i &apos;ve been telling you for a year you need to get plucked .
pick up . fried egg over easy .
correction : make that over hard .
max , that &apos;s earl &apos;s order .
can you ?
you know , i could just check out
and phone in this job , too ,
but i promised myself
i &apos;d never grow up to be my gynecologist .
earl , i know you remember a time
where people still made eye contact
and get the fact that i was totally dissing them .
it &apos;s a damn shame , max .
thank you , earl .
the mets are down in the bottom of the sixth .
now you have one ?
earl , three months ago ,
you thought t @-@ mobile was a rapper .
max , i want to talk to you .
well , why not ?
everyone else is listening to something tiny
and made in asia .
i just heard the funniest joke .
a guy is driving a car up a hill
and he sees a pig in the road .
wait . oh yes , i forgot .
it &apos;s raining .
it &apos;s raining , and there is a pig .
i &apos;m listening .
and then the pig is in the car--
no , the pig is in the road ,
and--i &apos;ll be right back .
thank you . come again .
hey , what do you want to do after work tonight ?
maybe we could go to that trendy new ice cream place
that only sells juice .
nah , i &apos;m too tired .
i &apos;ve been on my feet since 2003 .
hi , can i get a red velvet--
oh , my god , max black ?
oh , my god , becky white ?
holy crap . how long has it been ?
let &apos;s see . when was i on &quot; intervention &quot; ?
访问其家庭成员 让他们说服主角同意接受帮助
well , your hair &apos;s grown back on the right side ,
so i &apos;d say five years .
hi , i &apos;m caroline .
i &apos;d wait for max to introduce me ,
but she usually tells people
i &apos;m taylor swift &apos;s slow cousin randi .
nice to meet you .
max , i did not think you would still be alive .
i owe you $ 10 .
becky &apos;s an actress .
i just saw her in &quot; law and order . &quot;
she owned &quot; deli worker who barely knew the victim . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;ve done three &quot; law and orders . &quot;
pretty easy work .
they usually find me in a trunk .
how do you two know each other ?
max and i waited tables together .
well , mostly stood around and got drunk ,
but they paid us .
nice shop .
looks like you guys have a business together too .
too ?
you two too ?
we invented an uber just for women .
boober .
it would &apos;ve been awesome ,
except we didn &apos;t have an app ... or a car .
hey , forget about this cupcake .
i just got paid .
how about drinks on me ?
and by drinks , i mean one pbr each .
i guess i could do drinks .
do you mind closing up ? thanks .
i &apos;ll meet you out front .
awesome .
nice meeting you , brandi .
it &apos;s randi !
hey , earl , what &apos;s shaking ?
max , i &apos;m pushing 80 .
the easier question is , &quot; what isn &apos;t shaking ? &quot;
max , where were you last night ?
i had to watch &quot; carson daly &quot; alone and say ,
目前已1600多集
&quot; this show &apos;s still on ? &quot; to no one .
i crashed on becky &apos;s couch ,
of which-- you &apos;re not gonna believe this--
she is the first owner .
so did you guys have fun last night ,
or was it weird because you &apos;ve grown apart ?
let &apos;s just say we &apos;re gonna be in not one ,
but two wedding albums .
becky can dance her some hora .
fun .
that &apos;s so fun that you had fun .
uh , what &apos;s happening here ?
i guess i just thought we were ...
forget it .
oh , no , please .
it &apos;s like watching a bird fly into a window in slow motion .
well , you know , i thought we were exclusive ,
for lack of a better word .
what , like monogamous ?
you thought we were in a monogamous friendship ?
i &apos;m not even monogamous with the people i &apos;m monogamous with .
what is the big deal ?
you had friends before we were friends .
bunch of rich bitches .
you guys talking about that show , &quot; friends &quot; ?
people always say , &quot; why was there no black friend ? &quot;
because no reasonable black man
would hang out with those people .
he &apos;s been waiting to get that off his chest
since the mid- &apos; 90s .
you know what i just realized ?
i &apos;ve never tried to make friends as a not @-@ rich person .
you made friends with me .
against my will , but still .
guess what i &apos;m doing ?
motivating me to look at resumes on monster.com ?
i &apos;m gonna make a friend right now .
there &apos;s a girl in my section with clean @-@ ish looking hair .
speaking of hair , pick up .
cobb salad .
max , how &apos;s this for my friend @-@ making smile ?
do you have more teeth than me ?
here &apos;s you salad . dressing on the side .
i &apos;m sort of a &quot; dos &quot; gal myself .
okay .
thanks .
maybe we should , i don &apos;t know , grab a couple salads sometime .
the yelp review specifically said
i would be ignored by the waitstaff .
there &apos;s hair in your salad .
excuse me .
the water &apos;s supposed to be that color .
no , no .
i just think it &apos;s cool how brave you were
to put yourself out there like that .
i haven &apos;t been called cool since i had a black card
and owned 3 / 4 of an island .
i &apos;m rachel . this is kathy .
i &apos;m caroline ,
and you have no idea how brave i am .
you should see where i shower .
she should come to our party .
she just moved to williamsburg ,
and we &apos;re having a party tomorrow .
you should come .
oh , you know what ?
i &apos;m busy tomorrow night because i &apos;m going to your party !
i &apos;ve seen people with podcasts less desperate for approval .
max , i had the most amazing night .
me too . becky just left .
she has to get up early tomorrow .
not to brag , but she &apos;s playing a dead hooker
on &quot; blue bloods . &quot;
oh , so she came here for research .
anyways , my new friends rachel and kathy
and everybody there were so warm and positive .
it was so refreshing to be around people
who were super driven and focused .
and we had such interesting conversations .
honestly , after talking to them ,
i felt like anything is possible .
oh , you guys did molly ?
now i &apos;m jealous .
these people don &apos;t need drugs to be happy .
oh , so it &apos;s a cult .
how did you get cult from that ?
you think the only way i can make friends
is by joining a cult ?
no .
you could also always have gum .
in fact , they &apos;re so nice ,
they invited you to come for the weekend .
fresh country air .
no thanks .
gorgeous views .
not for me .
free food and booze .
i could be in a cult for the weekend .
this place is amazing .
i know . fancy .
and that was the first bus i &apos;ve been on
where i didn &apos;t see an under @-@ the @-@ blanket handy .
i &apos;m topher . from the bus .
you were throwing sunflower seeds in my hair .
this is lady marmalade .
people named topher shouldn &apos;t be allowed
to name other living things .
please don &apos;t make fun of her .
she has seasonal depression .
we both do .
hey , caroline , i &apos;m so glad you could come .
and you must be ...
starving .
just give me the tray .
this is max .
thank you so much for inviting us .
yeah , the last invitation we got was to audition for porn .
less of an invitation ;
more of a shout from a convertible .
&quot; you girls want to do porn ? &quot;
well , elaine will be out in a minute ,
so in the meantime , just be your awesome self .
isn &apos;t she great ?
so see ? it &apos;s nice here .
and you thought it was a cult .
i also thought peanuts never touched the eggs at the diner ,
but then that lady died .
welcome , everyone .
hi , elaine .
there are only two rules in this house :
love one another
and don &apos;t talk to the neighbors .
i hate them .
i &apos;m so glad you all could make it .
oh , except jerry .
he &apos;s getting lasik .
he should &apos;ve listened . i told him to eat more kale .
kale is good for the eyes .
okay .
now make yourselves at home .
you mean don &apos;t pay our rent
and hide every time we hear someone in the hall ?
elaine , this is caroline ,
our new friend .
hello , caroline .
i &apos;ve heard so many wonderful things .
and you are ?
looking for some dipping sauces .
i &apos;m max .
a lady who knows what she wants . i like that .
my ex @-@ husband knew what he wanted :
to be a woman .
and now he is .
i miss her .
and all my shoes .
i hear you , sister .
but seriously , something like a honey mustard
or really anything in the dijon world .
whoo , she &apos;s a tough nut .
my favorite kind .
except for cashews .
max , elaine is amazing .
look around .
this is my new social circle .
this is the saddest circle i &apos;ve seen
since my mom peed on the floor at wal @-@ mart .
can you just admit it &apos;s not a cult ?
everyone gather &apos; round .
let &apos;s have some mutual eye contact .
that &apos;s nice . that &apos;s just being a person .
look to the person next to you ,
and open the door to them with your eyes .
bitch , that door is locked .
nicely done .
all right , everyone .
i &apos;d like us to recite our mantra .
my best is my best , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m blessed .
my best is my best ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m blessed .
don &apos;t mumble , connie .
my best is my best ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m blessed .
okay , it &apos;s a cult .
little bit .
my best is my best ...
all right , everyone .
let the sound of the bowls wash over you ,
cleansing you from head to toe
and everywhere in @-@ between .
these bowls got their work cut out for them .
everyone , close your eyes and quiet the mind ,
and receive the healing vibrations .
sound bathe us , eugene .
when you feel called to join the bowls ,
begin with a soft ...
i usually begin with a soft hummer .
how are we gonna get out of this ?
let &apos;s just call it what it is :
a cult .
i &apos;m not going anywhere
until i see what &apos;s in those bowls .
i &apos;m hoping for fettuccini .
i hope it &apos;s not fettuccini
because i really don &apos;t like cream @-@ based sauces .
do you mind ?
this is important for lady marmalade .
she has fibromyalgia .
fibromyalgia and seasonal depression ?
you really won the dog lottery .
all right , everyone .
you may gently bring your energy
back into the room
whenever you feel ready .
we got to get out of here .
what are we gonna do ? we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
you know what would save the day right now ?
boober .
caroline .
did anything come up for you during the sound bath ?
a little bit of the chicken satay , but all good .
max , how are you ?
were you touched at all ?
in high school , i was touched by an angel .
well , technically , his name was ...
angel .
i know this probably all seems like a lot of hooey ,
but i assure you you &apos;ll wake up feeling refreshed .
and eugene makes a hell of a pancake breakfast .
he uses ricotta .
we &apos;re staying .
i mean , ricotta ? we gotta .
i guess so .
it &apos;ll be like staying at a b and b
run by a lame ron hubbard .
goodnight , everyone .
rachel has your room assignments .
caroline , you &apos;re sharing a room with me .
yay .
max , you &apos;re sharing a room with topher and lady marmalade .
can i ever get a good roommate ?
and do not fear .
before the night is over , each of you will have a chance
to make love with me .
and the rest of the satay just came up .
before the sunrise , our moons will unite .
well , i &apos;m guessing her moon &apos;s not waxed .
caroline .
caroline .
caroline , where are you ?
caroline ?
i thought you were gonna be elaine ...
and i &apos;m not drunk enough for that !
by the way , the piglet &apos;s popping the snout out .
oh , i thought you were gonna be elaine .
and i thought i was gonna be dead at 14,
but you can &apos;t always get what you want .
max !
max , oh , my god . are you okay ?
please tell me elaine didn &apos;t get to you .
i could never live with myself .
or you .
i &apos;m sorry it took me so long to climax .
i know i was almost there for quite some time .
max , caroline , what are you doing out here ?
we were just anxiously awaiting
intercourse with you .
really ?
&apos;cause unless that bag &apos;s full of marital aids ,
it looks like you &apos;re trying to sneak out .
look , elaine ,
this is all a lot , and no offense ,
but you can &apos;t be the first person
i have sex with this year .
i understand that you &apos;re both feeling a little overwhelmed ,
but before you go , why don &apos;t we discuss this as a group
in a healing way ?
all right , eugene , stay where you are .
you need some rest .
maybe a little protein .
so you know what ? we &apos;re just gonna go .
you can tell that guy at the door
he can just step aside so we can ,
you know , start running .
caroline , you are free to go at any time .
so we can go right now ?
no .
caroline , why don &apos;t you sit here , and rachel ,
bring max over by the gong .
siri , remind me to patent a gong bong .
also remind me to get a phone with siri .
now , i know some of you have not yet laid with me tonight ...
but it &apos;s come to my attention
that we have an n.n. in our midst .
what ?
who ?
quick q on the n.n.
do either of those ns stand for nachos ?
n.n. stands for negative nelly .
negative nancy was already trademarked
by another group run by my ex @-@ husband , nancy .
caroline , do you have any idea who this n.n. could be ?
i believe it &apos;s &quot; whom &quot; and no , i don &apos;t .
caroline , are you where you want to be in life ?
oh , god , no .
and would you say there &apos;s someone holding you back ?
well , i do feel like
hearing about amy schumer every day
makes me feel a little &quot; less than . &quot;
caroline , is there someone in this room
who you brought with brown hair
whose negative nelly @-@ ness
is blocking you in ways you don &apos;t even realize ?
wait a minute .
i &apos;m starting to think this is about me .
just having spent a few short hours with max
and recording all your conversations ...
it &apos;s pretty clear
that she is undermining your path to success
with her wisecracks and wordplay .
look .
max might seem negative , because she is ,
but you would be , too , if you were her .
she &apos;s been neglected , rejected ,
knocked down , and spat on .
some of that was consensual .
see ? that was positive .
so you will give up all these potential connections
just for her ?
caroline , i used to live in jersey city ,
and now i live in a better part of new jersey .
elaine , i thought i needed to make new friends ,
and that &apos;s how i wound up here ,
but turns out all i needed was max .
i &apos;ll take my chances with her .
huge mistake .
huge .
well , then you &apos;re free to go .
just need to settle up your bill .
this weekend is only free for friends .
rachel .
i ate $ 700 worth of shrimp ?
that seems about right .
we can &apos;t pay that .
is there a ship we can scrub ?
or a gay celebrity we can marry ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll settle up with elaine .
do you accept nature &apos;s credit card ?
get out .
i can &apos;t believe the only way i can make a friend
is to join a cult .
well , you made friends with me , and i &apos;m not in a cult ...
anymore .
max , are you and i gonna be like you and becky someday ?
not unless one of us gets really , really ,
i mean , so much cooler .
i &apos;m serious .
am i gonna be just some waitress you used to know ?
&apos;cause that would kill me .
i don &apos;t think of you that way at all .
i mean as a waitress .
look , yes , becky and i worked together ,
and yes , we had kind of a business dream , too ,
but you and i have so much more than that .
you and i are about to die in the woods .
look .
we are getting in that car
even if this guy has a hook for a hand .
wazzup ?
hey , girls .
i never thought i &apos;d be happy to see oleg
on a dark road at night .
sophie , what are you guys doing here ?
oh , well , max texted me her location .
said if i didn &apos;t hear back from her ,
you &apos;d been abducted by the cult and to come rescue you .
i was in a cult once .
it &apos;s called avon .
so you were so certain i couldn &apos;t make a normal friend
you had an escape plan ?
hey , sometimes my negativity pays off .
sometimes it gets me in mall jail .
