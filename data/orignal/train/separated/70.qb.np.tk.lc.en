and that &apos;s just the beginning .
at herald equity ,
we &apos;ve seen a 31 % rise in biotechnology .
and a 52 % rise in holographic imaging .
thank you , stock holders ,
for helping herald equity look to the future .
now let &apos;s give a big hand to
the board of directors of herald equity .
this isn &apos;t about morals . it &apos;s about money .
he &apos;ll try to make it about your backstory .
he needs to go there
because he can &apos;t stand on his record as a ceo .
the bastard .
but you stay calm . keep your voice low .
he gets you to raise your voice , or lose your cool , he wins .
and if he asks me about killing my wife ?
well , there &apos;s no &quot; if . &quot; he will ask you .
that &apos;s his only play .
i was asking my legal consultant .
mrs. florrick ?
say you didn &apos;t . it &apos;s the truth , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
thank you .
you &apos;re trying to take back the company that was stolen from you .
this is about the 30 % decline
in stock price since gerald drescher took over .
and the vote is going my way ?
we swung brynford mutual your way this morning .
36,000 shares .
good .
and your firm will have a five percent stake , mrs. florrick .
that must look good for you , making so much money .
yes , it does . happy days .
you know , others may find your cynicism bracing , mrs. florrick .
i find it charming .
okay , here we go . first line ?
i believe in stem cells . that is our future .
good !
boos ? really ?
how gauche .
ladies and gentlemen ...
he &apos;s weird with you .
yep .
... my company has been mismanaged .
it has seen its value drop by 30 % ...
yeah , what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re being evicted .
we &apos;re not being evicted . here ...
that &apos;s what he said , he said 90 days .
don &apos;t dramatize it . he said it &apos;s a condo conversion .
wait , wait , what &apos;s s going ?
mr. pedrono from the eighth floor ,
he &apos;s here to inspect the apartment ,
and tell us to get out in 90 days .
this is going on now ?
i can talk to her if she wants .
do you want to talk to him ?
yeah , put him on .
alicia , come on .
mrs. florrick ,
i didn &apos;t want you to get the wrong impression .
this is good news .
um , what &apos;s good news , mr. pedrono ?
we &apos;re giving all the tenants a chance to own and not rent .
i told your husband about it a year ago .
you told peter ?
oh , yes .
we &apos;ve had this in the works for a while .
your lease is up in 90 days ,
and we &apos;re giving you a chance to purchase .
um , so we &apos;re being threatened with eviction ?
no , you &apos;re being given the chance
of first refusal to purchase
as is your right as a current tenant .
okay , let &apos;s talk later today , mr. pedrono .
but for the moment , please delay your inspection , okay ?
if that &apos;s what you &apos;d like .
but please get back to me soon-- we need to know your plans .
you &apos;ll be the first person i &apos;ll call .
multitasking ?
like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
so , where are we on speakers ?
um , drescher &apos;s side has five at microphones .
yes , peter , when you get this message , call me back . thanks .
there is something else ,
i just happened to overhear drescher &apos;s lawyer on her cell .
just happened ?
more or less .
she was celebrating because they just moved some late shares
to drescher &apos;s column .
wishful thinking ?
sounded real .
sounded like she has enough to beat sweeney .
36,800 shares .
which mutual fund is in play ?
i don &apos;t know . i thought everyone was firmed up .
caitlin , hi . are you in the war room ?
yes .
is diane there ?
no , she went out about an hour ago .
who do we have with 36,800 shares ?
uh , let me check . uh , it &apos;s alicia .
which of the mutual funds has 36,800 votes ?
we &apos;re checking . it doesn &apos;t sound familiar .
it doesn &apos;t , does it ? is will there ?
yes , in his office .
well , this used to be his case ,
so see if that number rings a bell .
okay , he &apos;s in with somebody .
well , interrupt him .
we have ten minutes till the vote .
you &apos;re suspended for six months , will .
this is serious business .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not .
but i &apos;m more than a lawyer . i run a business here .
which is why the disciplinary board is
allowing you to be here , in your office ,
but that &apos;s all .
then tell me the rules ..
if you want there to be no crossover ,
then tell me what i can &apos;t ... i &apos;m sorry , mr. gardner ,
alicia said she needs an answer right now .
what &apos;s wrong ?
she &apos;s at the proxy fight .
they &apos;re worried 36,800 shares have switched sides
and they don &apos;t know which ones .
okay , here we go , lionel .
does my suspension prevent me from answering that question ?
well , does the question have to do with
the legal side of lockhart / gardner , or the business side ?
mr. sweeney is a client we represent
both criminally and financially .
but at the moment , we &apos;ve been asked to consult on his proxy fight .
legally consult ?
and financially .
caitlin .
we &apos;re nearing a vote .
i know ,
mr. gardner is trying to figuring out whether he can answer
and if caitlin rephrases the question
as a business @-@ only question ?
such as ?
how many proxy votes , absent any ...
will , you can &apos;t give her the question .
she has to ask the question .
you &apos;re kidding .
to advise a subordinate on a legal question
is to offer legal advice .
okay , then we just sit here .
how about mr. gold ?
yes .
part of our firm is mr. gold &apos;s crisis management .
can she ask me a question as to that ?
sure , go ahead . take your time .
she can ask questions regarding the crisis management ,
but she has to formulate the questions .
hold on .
mr. gold is concerned his client will lose
the proxy fight due to the loss of 36,800 votes .
do you have any idea who they might belong to ?
tenley mutual .
diane &apos;s leaving there now . try her cell and you might get her .
no , thank you . we &apos;ll be in touch .
hello , caitlin .
uh , yes , i had to switch off during the meeting .
no , we &apos;re leaving now .
hold on a minute .
mr. tenle .
did you just lie to me ?
i &apos;m stronger for it .
i &apos;m tougher for it .
and i &apos;m ready to retake the reigns
of the company i created .
he said he told you a year ago .
he &apos;s lying . i never met a mr. pedrono .
you know what he &apos;s doing , don &apos;t you ?
establishing a timeline .
that &apos;s right .
he needs to give fair warning
before he can enforce an eviction .
would you sign an affidavit to that effect ?
i will . but you should think about doing it .
buying .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
you like it .
the kids like it .
it &apos;s a lot of debt to take on .
i thought you were making the really big bucks over there .
yeah , that &apos;s me .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to you later , peter .
oh , uh , hey , it &apos;s eli . we have a problem .
when don &apos;t we have a problem , eli ?
were you just on with alicia ?
was i ? yeah , why ?
you just sounded ... good together .
i was standing right next to her .
eli , stop scheming .
now , what &apos;s hurting my chances to being governor today ?
a blog called the &quot; cook county @-@ ienne . &quot;
it says the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office is a hotbed
of workplace sex , and that you approve of it .
and when is a blog ever wrong ?
peter , it is specific .
it says that two asas had sex on your office couch three nights ago .
eli , we can &apos;t listen to every stupid piece of gossip .
yes , but we can be responding
to every piece that involves you and sex .
we are vulnerable on sex issues , peter ,
for reasons i hope i don &apos;t have to spell out .
you swore you would run a clean office . this is dirty .
so , we can get him back on our side ?
they &apos;ll swing the 36,800 shares to sweeney
if he guarantees them another seat on the board .
oh , that shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
and one more thing .
no more drama .
that &apos;s why drescher convinced them to peel away .
sweeney is too high maintenance .
you &apos;re asking me to guarantee no more drama from mr. sweeney ?
can you guarantee he won &apos;t kill anyone in the next five minutes ?
well , i think that shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
okay , well , tenley will call in his vote , and he &apos;s in our camp .
how &apos;s sweeney doing ?
first of all , thank you for that question .
or should i thank your boss , mr. drescher ,
for the question he asked you to ask ?
he &apos;s very good at this . if i had stock , i might even vote for him .
good . and good job , alicia .
i know how hard this sweeney business is on you .
oh , i &apos;m fine . but thank you .
in fact , diane , um ,
can we talk sometime about things ?
well , that sounds ominous .
oh , no , i just , i mean , salary .
i hate discussing this , but i thought being on the partner track ...
well , we &apos;ll talk about it .
let &apos;s just get sweeney in as ceo ,
and then we can talk about a raise .
okay ?
okay . thanks diane .
hi , i &apos;m isobel swift .
i work here as a contractor in executive event planning .
do you recognize me , mr. sweeney ?
um , no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
uh @-@ oh . uh @-@ oh ? why uh @-@ oh ?
drama .
the woman you sexually harassed when you hired me ,
and who you threatened to fire when i wouldn &apos;t sleep with you .
and the women who intends to sue you
and herald equity for sexual harassment .
young woman ,
you know for a fact that &apos;s not true .
then how do you explain this ?
meet your son , mr. sweeney .
the ninth floor , north @-@ facing .
that &apos;s some of our best views .
i understand , mr. pedrono . how much are we talking ?
for your four bedroom ?
it &apos;s three bedroom and a bonus .
your three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half bedroom , it &apos;s $ 1.2 million .
but remember , you can get great financing .
and that &apos;s everything in ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , i know when these tenant @-@ conversions go condo ,
they sometimes have add @-@ ons .
well , you &apos;ll have to purchase the parking space .
and there will be a monthly charge for the association fees .
and that &apos;ll run me ... ?
$ 35,000 for the parking ,
and 2,000 a month for the association .
thank you . i &apos;ll get back to you .
we lost the proxy vote ,
but we &apos;ve applied for an immediate injunction
against the vote results . unfortunately ...
there seems to be a narrative of unfortunately &apos;s .
yes . unfortunately , we are up against a deadline .
mr. sweeney lost the proxy fight ,
so , the law requires he liquidate
his shares in 72 hours .
so we have 72 hours to win an injunction ?
yes .
and we must prove two things in court .
one , isobel swift &apos;s accusations are a lie .
that the paternity is a lie ?
no , the sexual harassment is a lie .
and the only proof of harassment is paternity ,
so i &apos;m applying for an immediate paternity test .
go ahead , caitlin .
and second , we have to prove this accusation
was intended to throw the proxy vote .
if drescher is behind isobel &apos;s lies ,
then mr. sweeney will get a re @-@ vote
and drescher will be precluded from running .
so you need to prove a connection
between isobel and drescher ?
yes . i am going to court today .
actually , you &apos;re going to court today , aren &apos;t you , alicia ?
yes , caitlin and i.
good . and everybody knows the rules
regarding will &apos;s suspension .
you can &apos;t talk to me about specific legal cases .
but you can confer with me on issues dealing with eli &apos;s business .
when in doubt , talk to me about
what can be discussed with will and what cannot .
so what does mr. sweeney say about this woman ?
he didn &apos;t touch her . he hired her . but that &apos;s all .
and we believe him ?
well , the timing of isobel &apos;s accusations seem suspicious .
so , guardedly , yes .
good , so let &apos;s get moving .
thank you .
you &apos;re on it , right ?
finding a connection between drescher and isobel ?
yep .
alicia .
yeah ?
watch out for that one .
i know , but i &apos;m tired of being paranoid .
she &apos;s just hungry .
like a piranha .
she &apos;s hiding something .
it &apos;s not about having sex on my couch .
it &apos;s about perception .
i want you to talk to your asas .
informally .
four days ago , who had sex in this office ?
cary will coordinate .
the rules are very clear , people .
no fraternization between coworkers .
i &apos;m not gonna let this office devolve into a frat house .
not gonna happen .
ironic , huh ?
what &apos;s that ?
you , investigating fraternization in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
when your relationship with asa dana lodge
might be interpreted as such .
do you have something you want to say , geneva ?
just said it .
will i admit to the odd sexual dalliance now and then ?
course .
i &apos;m human .
i like sex .
don &apos;t you , your honor ?
mr. sweeney , you enjoy being inappropriate ,
saying things intended to shock .
you &apos;ll find that doesn &apos;t work here .
i am not charmed .
my apologies , your honor .
i will be more circumspect .
mr. sweeney , you did not have sex
with isobel swift , did you ?
no . she &apos;s not to my taste . much too obvious .
objection , your honor .
sustained .
but you did hire her ?
of course .
i needed someone at herald equity
to entertain associates when they were in town .
a sort of fredo , but prettier .
what happened when mr. drescher replaced you as ceo ?
well , when i went to prison ,
i cleaned house to make room for his appointments .
i thought that was the gentlemanly thing to do .
you fired isobel ?
yes , as part of my housecleaning .
and isobel was rehired by mr. drescher ?
uh , your honor , i &apos;m not sure why mrs. florrick rewards the men
in her narrative with a formal honorific ,
but women are demoted to their christian names .
well , clearly , it &apos;s because i want to influence the judge somehow ...
are you suggesting that i &apos;m trying to influence the judge ?
thank you .
given that there was no objection ,
please continue , mr. sweeney .
thank you , your honor .
yes , mr. drescher rehired her .
i imagine he was impressed by ms. swift &apos;s tremendous work
in soft @-@ core movies .
objection , your honor . relevance .
there &apos;s no jury , ms. adler .
this is an emergency injunction .
i know ms. swift worked in soft @-@ core movies
before she changed careers .
overruled .
i myself was impressed by her
tremendous skills in this area ,
especially with one particular film ,
where she ...
but of course ,
i was surprised that gerald kept her on .
gerald is , of course ,
mr. drescher over there .
that &apos;s why i think she &apos;s accusing me .
because she &apos;s angry with me ...
objection .
i &apos;ll withdraw that .
save everybody time .
two dinner receipts , one belonging to gerald drescher .
he &apos;s the ceo of herald equity .
and the other belonging to isobel swift , his employee .
both for exactly the same amount , down to the penny .
meaning ?
they both had dinner together ,
split the bill in half and then expense @-@ accounted it .
and you want to know ... ?
how close they were .
did they leave together ?
are they ...
sleeping with each other ?
well , waitresses do have the best gossip .
well , i &apos;ve seen them together .
they did seem pretty close .
but she &apos;s a ceo slut .
she &apos;s always hanging on the ceos .
like that other guy .
what other guy ?
the one accused of murder .
colin sweeney ?
yeah .
she was here with him , before he went to jail .
and you observed them together ?
well , if by &quot; together &quot; you mean , did i observe them
slip into the men &apos;s room for about 20 minutes
and come out half undressed ?
yes .
all right . there was oral sex .
but it was before i hired her .
there wasn &apos;t sexual harassment .
you perjured yourself , mr. sweeney .
how do you figure ?
you said you never had sex , ever .
there was no real sex . there was oral sex .
you didn &apos;t ask me about oral sex .
oh , my god .
so there was no vaginal sex , is that right ?
yeah .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
she performed oral sex on five occasions .
nothing special .
i found her businesslike and ...
okay .
what are you thinking ?
the paternity test .
it &apos;ll come back negative .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s as if i &apos;m telling the truth .
say a client perjured himself .
just any client ?
yes .
because if this were a specific client ,
i could not legally answer .
any client .
and you discover , after putting him on the stand , he perjured himself .
without knowing it , you suborned perjury ?
then you can &apos;t question him further , pursuant to
the code of professional responsibility ,
not without knowingly suborning more perjury .
right .
but now the opposing attorney
intends to put another witness on the stand to contradict him .
with the truth ?
or another lie , i don &apos;t know .
can i use this perjured testimony , now in the record ,
to question this opposing witness ?
you must represent the interests of your client .
you were not aware of the perjury when it happened .
to not use that perjured testimony
would be to poorly represent your client .
so , yes , you can use it .
as if it were the truth ?
no , as if it &apos;s in the record as the testimony of your client .
that &apos;s what i thought .
the law is an odd thing .
it is indeed .
of course you &apos;re getting legal advice from a suspended lawyer .
the only problem :
if the opposing attorney wants to
put your client back on the stand ,
your hands are tied .
i can &apos;t elicit further testimony that i know is perjured ?
yes .
that &apos;ll make it one hard redirect .
so you were working that night ,
but you didn &apos;t go into peter &apos;s office ?
no . we were working the 65th street burglaries .
and you didn &apos;t go onto the executive floor ?
no .
see , here &apos;s the problem .
the log shows you accessed this floor on three occasions .
just tell me .
jeremy .
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
but you had sex in peter &apos;s office ?
if i say &quot; yes , &quot; w- what will happen ?
peter just wants to make sure it won &apos;t happen again .
nothing in my permanent record ?
that &apos;s right .
we got bigger fish to fry .
just tell me what happened .
and so mr. sweeney always met you in hotel rooms ?
to have sex , yes .
and that was on how many occasions ?
eight occasions .
before he wento to jail .
while you were working at herald equity .
and then the last time ,
when you resisted him , you were fired ?
yes .
thank you , ms. swift .
so , isobel ...
mr. sweeney insists you never had sex .
isn &apos;t it a fact that you &apos;re lying to us today ?
no .
he testified on his whereabouts
on all the nights you claimed to have had sex .
isn &apos;t it a fact ?
he &apos;s lying .
and yet this is your only argument in response ?
&quot; he &apos;s lying . &quot;
yes .
he sexually harassed me .
ms. swift , my client took this stand ,
and he swore to tell the truth .
he swore he didn &apos;t touch you .
he testified in great detail on all the ...
on all the nights you claim he was having sex with you
that he was somewhere else .
how is this not a classic he @-@ said / she @-@ said ?
because it &apos;s not .
because ... i &apos;m telling the truth .
and that &apos;s all you have to say ?
that is why we should believe you ?
nothing further .
you &apos;re excused .
your honor , we &apos;d like to recall
mr. sweeney to the stand .
we strongly object , your honor .
mr. sweeney has already testified .
this is not a full trial .
we are merely asking for an emergency injunction .
yes , and counselor adler
is merely requesting a simple recall of your witness .
i see no reason to deny her .
we will adjourn until tomorrow .
and the square footage ?
oh , it &apos;s not what you have now , but you can put up a wall
and split that bedroom into two for the kids .
oh , any bigger kitchens ?
told you not to prejudge it .
you &apos;re prejudging it .
this is really the best i can do ?
in your budget range ,
near the private school ,
in a good neighborhood , yes .
but more will come on the market this summer .
you know what &apos;s funny ?
what ?
i have the perfect place for you .
you do ? where ?
a house .
in fact , you &apos;ve seen it .
when ? oh , the last time we looked ?
no , before that .
your house .
my ... ?
the people who bought your old house in highland park ,
they &apos;re upside- down on it and very , very motivated .
no .
that &apos;s what i thought .
it &apos;s a little out of your range , anyway .
uh , and weird .
i mean , it would be weird .
you had 15 happy years there .
why would it be weird ?
because it- it would .
maybe we &apos;re all like salmon ,
just trying to swim upstream to get back to our homes again .
oh , there &apos;s your cell phone , again .
diane , hi .
yes .
they recalled sweeney to the stand ,
and the judge overruled my objection .
so i think we ...
yes , caitlin already filled me in .
i think her idea is right .
her idea ?
prepping sweeney .
you need to question him again on redirect .
and the only way to avoid further perjury
is to prep him for it .
it &apos;s a tight ethical line he has to walk .
yes , it is .
good luck with it .
have caitlin keep me posted .
she has good instincts for a first @-@ year , don &apos;t you think ?
i do .
so , as long as it &apos;s my word against hers , i &apos;m fine , right ?
your word is the problem here .
the other lawyer will ask you
about things that actually happened .
and this time , you have to tell the truth .
of course .
we can &apos;t advise you , for example ,
to dispute ms. swift &apos;s uncorroborated statements
if you know them to be true ,
or attack ms. swift &apos;s credibility any chance you get .
yes , i appreciate your not advising me to do those things .
i &apos;ll also be asking questions on redirect , mr. sweeney ,
and you need to answer me truthfully . do you understand ?
that is the only way i can question you .
scout &apos;s honor , mrs. florrick .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to get my beauty rest before court .
telling the truth is so ... tiring .
this will be good for a laugh .
caitlin .
can i talk to you ?
uh , yes .
we haven &apos;t had much of a chance to talk .
i know .
and i want you to take what
i &apos;m about to say as constructive advice from a mentor .
okay .
don &apos;t ever undercut your mentor again .
under ... what do you mean ?
your strategy
was to prep sweeney to avoid further perjury ?
oh , my god . diane cornered me coming back from court .
she just wanted to know where we were ,
and i was just updating her .
i don &apos;t want any explanations .
i just want you to be proud
of the way you conduct yourself here .
being an associate in a law firm , people judge you .
the point is ,
all you want to be judged on is your work .
your work .
i understand .
good .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
yes , these are receipts from the evanston tavern .
i went there often with ms. swift in 2008 .
for what purpose ?
to discuss events she was planning .
given that she was an events planner .
so these were business meetings ?
held 20 miles from your office .
because you couldn &apos;t find a single restaurant
in chicago that had a table .
not one that can make an authentic coq au vin , no .
mr. sweeney , isn &apos;t it true
that you and ms. swift repaired to the bathroom
at the evanston tavern to engage in oral sex ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
isn &apos;t it relevant whether mr. sweeney and ms. swift
engaged in oral sex ?
overruled .
mr. sweeney , please answer the question .
did i engage in oral sex with ms. swift ?
no .
mr. sweeney , you realize you are under oath ?
your honor .
that &apos;ll do , ms. adler .
nothing further , your honor .
just to confirm , mr. sweeney ,
prior to ms. swift &apos;s allegations ,
no one had ever accused you of
having a sexual relationship with an employee ?
that is correct .
and at the time , no one ever accused you of having a sexual relationship
with ms. swift ?
and that is correct .
good .
and i want to be clear here .
not only did i never have oral sex with that woman ,
or any sex , but i was suffering ...
from a skin condition at the time .
i couldn &apos;t have had oral sex .
mrs. florrick ?
do you have anything further ?
your honor , uh ...
pursuant to the code of professional responsibility ,
i have no further questions at this time .
their excuses ?
no excuses .
just abject apologies .
levitas is the head of the financial crimes unit ,
and cooper &apos;s a second year who works under him .
so his direct supervisor ?
yes . but ...
but what ?
disciplining two gay men
for having gay sex is gonna look bad .
well , i &apos;m not disciplining them for their sexual orientation ,
or the type of sex they &apos;re having .
i &apos;m disciplining them for having sex in this office .
i &apos;m just saying .
there are rules , cary .
and one of them is zero tolerance
for sexual liaisons in the workplace .
especially ,
if you &apos;re in a supervisory position .
i found the connection between drescher and isobel .
he made payments to her anonymously ,
from a shell company in the caymans .
fantastic . tell diane i &apos;m on my way .
that idiot ! that bastard !
sweeney ? what &apos;d he do now ?
he fathered a son .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
paternity test came back . positive .
it &apos;s sweeney &apos;s kid .
for the last time , i did not sleep with that woman .
well , unfortunately , the court does not recognize the
doctrine of immaculate conception .
okay , look .
taking you and your word , which we have no reason to ,
how could this happen ?
no idea .
we never had vaginal sex .
i had a client who lost a paternity suit a few years back .
he claimed there was only oral sex .
turns out , his girlfriend had a turkey baster .
and so it devolves :
from hopes , ideals , dreams ,
the glory of the law , to a turkey baster .
immediately after isobel fellated you ,
what happened ?
she repaired to the bathroom , right ?
purse in hand .
she closed the door .
emerges a few minutes later ,
rosy bloom on her cheeks .
oh , dear lord .
mazel tov , mr. sweeney .
you &apos;re the proud father of 18 years of child support .
can we make a fraud argument ?
contraceptive fraud ?
yes .
well , it &apos;d offset the child support .
but isobel will claim mr. sweeney &apos;s sperma was a gift .
she could do with it as she pleased .
to get the re @-@ vote ,
first we had to show fraud on isobel &apos;s part .
if we can demonstrate
mr. drescher &apos;s knowledge of contraceptive fraud ,
the court will order a new election ,
and he &apos;ll be precluded from running .
okay , i &apos;ll revise the injunction ...
what the hell did you do to caitlin ?
what did i ...
she &apos;s resigning . she &apos;s quitting the firm .
why ?
you never wanted to hire her to begin with .
and i see the way you treat her .
the jealousy . the mean girl act .
you were supposed to mentor her , not haze her .
david , i have no idea what ...
you don &apos;t make enemies . that &apos;s what you don &apos;t do .
peter fired jeremy .
i know .
zero tolerance is zero tolerance .
that &apos;s right .
unless you &apos;re white .
he fires wendy scott @-@ carr .
he fires jeremy .
he demotes dana .
he promotes you over matan .
he promotes you over me .
three asas who had double or triple
your experience and seniority ,
and the only difference was the color of our skin .
go tell him .
if you believe that , go tell him .
what , that his bias is showing ?
no , that dana and i were fraternizing .
that &apos;s what you want to say .
zero tolerance , right ?
go .
no .
why not ?
because i don &apos;t do that .
you want him to know , you tell him .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s a bad economy for ideals .
so we &apos;re moving ?
well , i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing .
but we have to move , right ?
we have to do something .
i &apos;m looking at our options .
what ?
your realtor friend came by , and dropped this off .
it &apos;s not ...
she was just saying it was on the market .
do you see they still have the old swing there ?
you broke your leg on that swing .
that swing almost killed you .
i know , just i remember dad pushing me on it .
they painted it , see .
i like the old color better .
we don &apos;t have the money .
i wish we did , kids , but it &apos;s a lot .
alicia , caitlin has given notice .
yes , i &apos;ve heard .
i &apos;m surprised .
i &apos;ll stay as long as you need to finish my work .
but why , caitlin ?
i ... i thought you were liking it here .
i am ...
so much .
i just ...
i got the results back two weeks ago .
i &apos;m pregnant .
i &apos;m getting married .
i ...
yes .
congratulations .
it &apos;s wonderful news .
i explained how supportive the firm can be
in situations like these .
we have a generous maternity leave package .
and child care . and several telecommuting options .
and i really am grateful .
really , i am . i just , um ...
i just , uh , i want to be ...
what ?
a mom .
thank you .
well ...
yes ?
you should talk to her .
i will .
mr. sweeney &apos;s sperm was not a gift .
your honor , even assuming this turkey baster fiction is true ,
the sperm at issue was donated without expectation of return .
ergo , a gift .
mr. lee , you &apos;re arguing contraceptive fraud .
your position is mr. sweeney &apos;s
property has been ... misappropriated ?
your honor , does this even merit a response ?
the concept here is that if
the property were not put to its proper use ...
wait a minute . if we agree to call it &quot; property , &quot; your honor ,
then it was abandoned property .
and whoever claims abandoned property
has the right to put it to any use .
okay , enough .
i &apos;m intrigued enough to allow plaintiff to argue contraceptive fraud .
disgusted , but intrigued .
thank you , your honor .
with the caveat ...
... that i have heard no evidence to substantiate such a claim .
and the burden of proof remains with mr. sweeney .
then we would like to recall a witness to the stand .
these invoices reflect payments mr. drescher made to you .
how do you explain them ?
compensation .
gerald recognizes the value of a good employee .
but compensation from his shell company ?
i didn &apos;t know where it came from . i just accepted it .
and there was no quid pro quo ?
no ... ?
no trade @-@ off ?
no expectations mr. drescher
would receive something in return ?
no .
just to clarify , isobel--
ms. swift-- your testimony
is that your child is the result of consensual sex
between you and our client ?
yes , of course .
in february of 2008 , did you take a class
about artificial insemination at the kenwood learning center ?
do you need a moment , ms . swift ?
no .
i just needed to remember .
yes , i did take such a class .
and did you ask the teacher of that class
how long sperm could survive in a turkey baster ?
your honor , objection . hearsay .
actually , the question is properly phrased .
if ms. d &apos;arcy went further
and asked for the teacher &apos;s response ,
that would be hearsay ,
so you may answer the question .
i don &apos;t remember what i asked .
i might have ; i might not have .
nothing further , your honor .
ms. swift ,
for the record ,
you never had any quid pro quo with ,
or trade @-@ offs , with mr. drescher ?
no , i never did .
thank you .
so if ...
and i wasn &apos;t going to say this ,
but since i &apos;m being called a liar ,
i never asked anybody about a turkey baster .
never .
counselor ,
anything further ?
actually , your honor ,
pursuant to the code of professional responsibility ,
i have no further questions .
you did great today , caitlin .
really great .
you don &apos;t have to be nice .
i &apos;m fine .
those are ... ?
invitations .
to the wedding .
sorry , yesterday i must &apos;ve seemed crazy ,
hiding them from you .
i was just embarrassed .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry if i came down on you hard before .
i think i may have misinterpreted a few things .
office politics around here can tend to make people paranoid .
you didn &apos;t come down hard , alicia .
you were great .
you &apos;re a good lawyer , caitlin .
you &apos;re smart and clever ,
and you handled today &apos;s questioning like a pro .
you can &apos;t give this up .
if you give this up for someone--
even someone important to you--
there &apos;s a chance you &apos;ll regret it .
i &apos;m not giving it up for my fiancé .
i &apos;m giving it up for myself .
i like the law , but i love my fiancé .
but you don &apos;t need to choose .
there &apos;s no reason why you can &apos;t work ,
be a wife and a mother .
but i want to choose .
maybe it &apos;s different for my generation , but ...
i don &apos;t have to prove anything .
or if i have to , i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m in love .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry i wasn &apos;t a great mentor , caitlin .
you were a great mentor .
thank you .
this is daddy &apos;s law firm , stanton .
oh , and these are daddy &apos;s lawyers .
mr. sweeney ,
this is ... unexpected .
yes , well , isobel and i have reached
a sensible accommodation , haven &apos;t we ?
we have .
an affidavit pursuant to which my beloved acknowledges
she was impregnated by , shall we say , unconventional means .
and further acknowledges mr. drescher &apos;s involvement .
remarkable .
yes , i &apos;m always happy to swap legal fees
for a $ 20 million stake in a public company .
um , so , uh ,
the two of you are now ... ?
raising a child .
ain &apos;t it grand ?
uh , mr. sweeney ?
oh , i &apos;ll be right there .
get the elevator , stanton .
i &apos;m happy if you two
have reached an amicable arrangement .
but ... are you sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
what , being a dad ?
oh , sure .
how hard could it be ?
i &apos;ll call if i need any child @-@ rearing advice .
come on , stanton .
daddy knows a wonderful place ...
oh . we can do this later .
i &apos;ve looked over the department records .
actually ...
sir , per your request that i notify you of all violations
of the anti @-@ fraternization policy ,
and in the spirit of full disclosure ...
you don &apos;t need to offer me any more names , okay ?
actually , i do .
i dated dana lodge .
how recent was this ?
we ended it a few weeks ago .
was this before we demoted her or after ?
after .
not good .
i want to be clear that we did not have sex in your office .
well , i &apos;m relieved to hear that .
bottom line , i thought it was wrong for me to be pointing fingers
if i wasn &apos;t going to point one at myself .
well , i appreciate your coming forward .
it &apos;s brave .
and it shows character .
thank you .
so let &apos;s just leave it at that .
at ... ?
what @-@ what @-@ what do you mean ?
cary , i don &apos;t condone what you did ,
but i know you .
and i know your heart is in the right place .
so .... let &apos;s just leave it at that .
i &apos;m sorry ,
sir , you said the rules have to apply to everybody .
they do .
but not to me ?
does anyone else know about you and dana ?
yeah .
i think i need to resign .
absolutely not .
then i think i need to be placed on temporary leave .
there has to be some consequence ,
or i &apos;m going to lose respect around here ,
and so are you .
let me ...
let me think about it , okay ?
thank you .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s much to get .
she &apos;s not very conflicted .
i &apos;m not sure the glass ceiling was broken for this .
actually , it probably was .
she &apos;ll be back in 15 years .
like you .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
you wanted to discuss salary ?
i did .
i do .
well , let me gather with will , and see what we can do .
it might not be everything you want .
i understand .
four bedrooms , four baths ,
