gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
vanessa said if i helped rufus ,
it &apos;d help me get you .
he &apos;s under the impression you tried to sabotage me ,
and you happen to make a perfect villain .
my goal was to destroy chuck .
my uncle is my worst enemy .
chuck tried to cover up the truth about my mother .
this one is from 8 : 00 p.m. the night of the fire .
what &apos;s on it ?
bart having an argument with a woman--
avery thorpe .
my father and avery thorpe were having an affair .
i &apos;ll explain it all in person .
i look forward to meeting with you , too , jack .
don &apos;t think i don &apos;t know it was you that sent princess sophie
that scrapbook from &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
without the royal court &apos;s approval ,
it means even more .
will you marry me ?
you &apos;ll never marry anyone else . you &apos;re mine .
i said it &apos;s over .
no !
mom , i have some news . i &apos;m engaged .
good morning , sleepyheads .
looks like &quot; dream until your dreams come true &quot;
wasn &apos;t such a good idea after all .
so i thought i &apos;d bring some luxury across the river .
brooklyn needs it .
it &apos;s all bars , bakeries , and babies .
no hotel in sight .
charles place . you up to attend the ribbon cutting ?
no , thanks .
still pissed i lied to raina about my father .
yeah , well , it was a big lie ... even for you .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m stepping out from under his dark shadow
and away from the bass name .
whatever you wanna call yourself or your hotel ,
you &apos;re still the same person .
and with everything going on ,
i still need my best friend by my side .
i saw what you did to blair .
going to stay with raina for a while .
if you walk out , don &apos;t be here when i get back .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m already gone .
really ? you &apos;re trying me again ?
does that seem like it &apos;s gonna work ?
you answered .
you &apos;re right . my bad .
wait . i know you don &apos;t like me , but can you at least
acknowledge that everything i told you was true ?
your point ?
you didn &apos;t need to have your cousin
make me look like a crazy , jealous bitch to dan .
oh , you don &apos;t need any help with that .
she said i manipulated her to ruin rufus &apos; business dinner .
you &apos;re telling me that innocent cousin charlie
came up with that by herself ?
i &apos;m saying you probably did
whatever she said you did .
if charlie &apos;s fighting back , good for her .
she &apos;s learning .
good @-@ bye , vanessa .
mmm . green .
yellow !
that &apos;s 0 @-@ for @-@ 4 . okay , let &apos;s try sour patch kids .
i thought we were gonna have breakfast .
this is breakfast . when i was little ,
sour patch kids were pretty much my best friends--
them and books .
books . oh , me , too . what was , uh , what was your favorite ?
i could try to be cool
and make something up , but if i were honest ...
&quot; flowers in the attic . &quot;
my copy literally fell apart .
really ? what was it that you loved most , uh , exactly ?
was it the gripping tale of teen incest or just the general
fine quality of the prose ?
oh , my god .
i totally should have lied and said fitzgerald .
i can tell he influences your writing ,
um , especially that story in &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
um ... was that about serena ?
uh , yeah , yeah , that was back when i was on the outside ,
not getting my own personal invitation
to the constance st. jude &apos;s black tie alumni fund @-@ raiser .
yeah , it &apos;s , uh ...
i wasn &apos;t gonna go , &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t exactly
the most popular kid in high school ,
so why relive that , right ? but then i thought , you know ,
maybe--maybe if you came with me , it &apos;d be fun .
yes ! are you kidding ? yes !
um ... blair is having
this little engagement toast beforehand ,
and she invited me .
i figured i @-@ i should go , so you want to meet me there ?
i &apos;d love to .
so ... here comes the future princess .
now ... what does that make us , i wonder .
well , as of now , nothing .
in choosing me , louis gave up his succession rights .
well , fortunately , we are here to throw you
an engagement party , so maybe we can fix that .
well , while this looks delicious ,
i thought we agreed on a champagne toast .
oh , of course . this ...
is the vitaminwater design competition
with the c.f.d.a.
me and joe zee and the vena cava girls--
we are the judges , and we will be picking
the final t @-@ shirt from a young designer
to complete the collection .
we can be launching someone &apos;s career .
well , let &apos;s keep our attention on my future , shall we ?
i really want the princess to understand
that louis can have me and his rightful title .
not to worry . i happen to be an expert mediator .
serena , did lily get those dresses that i sent over ?
you know , the maxi ones from last year &apos;s collection ?
i &apos;m on my way to spend the day with her , so i &apos;ll ask .
and be back in time for the engagement party , i hope ?
or not .
i &apos;d actually like to be engaged when it &apos;s over .
blair , i &apos;m sorry i sent those blasts to louis &apos; mother ,
but everything worked out great ,
so can we just enjoy it and move on , please ?
like much else in your life , that apology was underwhelming .
good to see you , eleanor .
you must be jack .
thank you for getting here so quickly .
it was nothing . your father and i go way back ,
which won &apos;t stop me
from inviting you to have is little chat
someplace more comfortable-- your hotel room .
i see the bass family resemblance .
so ...
what &apos;s this about that old building my brother burned down ?
i just found out my mother was in it .
i didn &apos;t even know she was dead until recently .
but now that i do , i want the revenge my dad never got .
chuck has proof that my mother &apos;s death wasn &apos;t an accident .
he &apos;s been covering it up ever since he found out .
while i ... love making my nephew suffer ,
what , besides entertainment , is in it for me ?
the reins of bass industries .
you know all the right things to say , don &apos;t you ?
what the hl ?
nate , i &apos;m sure you know jack .
yes , unfortunately , i do ,
but why do you ?
i &apos;ll be in touch to discuss details .
should &apos;ve known you &apos;d still be ding
on my nephew &apos;s leftovers .
you brought in jack bass ?
is that panic &apos;s art ? that looks great .
yeah . hey , um , your mom called ,
and , uh , she was concerned that you were due
for a refill on your medication and didn &apos;t get it .
shoot . i was so excited
about going to the fund @-@ raiser tonight with dan
that i forgot to pick it up on my way home . i &apos;ll go right now .
i already did .
uh , your mom told me that last time things went well ,
you stopped taking them .
and then they went from well to hell .
trust me , i never want that to happen again .
okay , neither do we .
you have nothing to worry about ,
unlike me who has no idea what i &apos;m gonna wear tonight .
new york is always so gray , even in the spring .
and the angles everywhere-- they are so harsh .
i &apos;ll be happy to be back in monaco .
the &quot; glenn ligon : america &quot; exhibit at the whitney
is definitely worth the trip .
there &apos;s nothing gray or angular there ,
except the building .
i think i &apos;ve had my fill
of your city &apos;s ugliness for this trip .
mother , please .
i &apos;m sorry for the way chuck behaved with the royal court .
he &apos;s out of my life for good ,
and you can rest assured that my family and friends
are nothing like him ... most of the time .
i suppose . i will see for myself this evening at your party .
and i was also thinking that we could go
to my alma mater &apos;s fund @-@ raiser tonight afterwards .
didn &apos;t one of caroline &apos;s bastard children
go to that school ? or was it albert ?
blair , do you know ?
uh ... i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i just remembered
that i have to get my dress for tonight altered .
i lost weight in the whirlwind romance ,
so , um , would you mind if i take a rain check for tea ?
of course . we &apos;ll see you tonight .
okay .
she &apos;s lying .
about losing weight ?
i had her followed .
if you are going to give up the throne for this girl ,
the least she can do is give up her bad habits for you .
the first place she went after you asked her to marry you ?
to see chuck bass .
let &apos;s hope the only thing b. has in common
with marie antoinette is impeccable taste ,
or she just might lose her head
before she gets her crown .
i can &apos;t believe how amazing these parties look .
oh , that &apos;s the constance st . jude &apos;s fund @-@ raiser .
it &apos;s a shame we &apos;re missing it this year
since my mom can &apos;t go .
actually ... um ... dan invited me .
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s great .
are you sure ? you said that you weren &apos;t seeing him ,
and i can call right now and cancel if you want .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
dan and i are barely even talking .
um ... i &apos;ve never been to a black tie affair before .
if only i had something to wear .
your mom &apos;s been super generous ,
but i can &apos;t put a dress like that on her black card .
wait . what about your trust fund ?
you &apos;re over 18 . why haven &apos;t you gotten it yet ?
maybe grandma and my mom &apos;s issues
are worse than we thought .
no , i bet that that &apos;s not it .
my mom and cece have basically gone &quot; celebrity rehab &quot;
on one another , and she &apos;s never held it against me and eric .
let me call and find out .
you &apos;re like my fairy godcousin .
i &apos;ll let you get started .
yeah .
well , look who finally came to her senses .
concierge at the empire said that you were here .
louis and i are still very much engaged .
then why are you here with me ?
i &apos;m risking my well @-@ being
to tell you your uncle jack is in town .
i saw him myself this afternoon .
make sense . you &apos;re building your way to hurt me .
i just came to warn you so you could prepare
for whatever it is jack is planning .
and how will i ever prepare for what you &apos;re planning ?
i should go .
can &apos;t be late for my engagement party .
already so royal ,
sensitive to the suffering of her subjects .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve been going through since that night .
chuck ...
just be careful .
and all this time , i thought you hated bart
because of his sunny personality .
i see you &apos;ve spoken with my daughter .
and apparently you haven &apos;t .
no . she &apos;s holding on to some anger
about this whole situation .
can &apos;t say i blame her .
doesn &apos;t mean i wanna do business with her .
which is why you called me .
what raina &apos;s proposing suits me fine .
it &apos;s just , your daughter &apos;s history with chuck ,
nate archibald crashing our meeting ,
looking like he just ran away from home--
the whole thing feels messy , juvenile .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
what did you have in mind ?
my nephew is at the edge of a cliff again .
nothing turns him upside down like losing blair waldorf .
all he needs is a push ,
and i &apos;ll have the men in lab coats waiting to catch him
when he falls .
let me know what i can do .
you can start by paying for drinks
during which we &apos;ll discuss what else you &apos;ll be paying for .
yeah , you know , there &apos;s one more thing .
i believe there &apos;s a box
chuck is protecting in his suite .
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s where bart kept mementos ,
letters from my wife .
it would mean the world to me
if i could have those things for myself .
i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re well compensated .
i &apos;ll make sure you get a key .
looks like someone got their trust fund .
thank you for vouching for me .
i got a loan from the bank of cece
until my official checkbooks arrive .
i &apos;ve also fallen in love with nina ricci ,
or whoever designs her dresses .
ooh , let me see .
oh , shoot . it &apos;s my mom . i better get this .
i &apos;ll show you later ?
of course .
hi , mom . i just got the most amazing dress
for this fund @-@ raiser at st. jude &apos;s tonight with dan .
uh , with my trust fund .
no , don &apos;t be mad .
everything &apos;s perfect .
i promise . nothing &apos;s wrong .
no , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what the doctor had in mind
when he said , &quot; use as directed . &quot;
how can you have an engagement party without the prince ?
oh , right . he &apos;s not one anymore .
i invited you to attend , not to speak .
here , try the &apos; 91 .
did you know that princess sophie
is an avid ornithologist , just like me ?
i cannot concentrate on vintage
with you droning on about insects .
my dear ...
ornithology is the study of birds , not insects .
i &apos;m cyrus rose , blair &apos;s stepfather ,
and this is my wife eleanor .
princes sophie ,
welcome to our tasteful and appropriate home .
thank you .
now i &apos;m a hugger . hope you don &apos;t mind .
oh ! princess sophie , i apologize for not greeting you properly .
o est louis ?
he said he would meet me here .
this is good work .
i figure two weeks . excuse me .
your highness , you &apos;ll forgive me if i &apos;m too busy to bow .
i don &apos;t appreciate the sarcasm ,
or , for that matter , anything else about you .
then we &apos;re equal .
except i &apos;m not pursuing your fiancee .
i know blair came here to see you .
maybe your fiancee is pursuing me .
i highly doubt that ,
after you humiliated her in front of the royal court .
so why don &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
shouldn &apos;t you be asking blair that ?
i want the truth .
if you can &apos;t trust blair to tell you the truth ,
you &apos;ve got bigger problems than me .
all i &apos;ll say is get used to it .
blair is nothing without her secrets .
w if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a real foe to fight .
what did you do to your hand ?
it will heal with time , unlike you ,
who &apos;s facing a lifetime doubting blair .
hey . what are you still doing here ?
uh , bringing mom dinner .
she &apos;s in a bidding war for a vintage birkin on ebay
and can &apos;t leave the computer .
but don &apos;t you have blair &apos;s engagement toast ?
i know you both have your issues .
i can &apos;t force blair to want me there .
but come on . it &apos;s blair .
she might have trouble saying it most of the time ,
but she loves you as much as she loves anybody .
of course she wants you there .
hey , sorry to barge in ,
but i &apos;m thinking about going to blair &apos;s party after all .
i just wanted to check that there &apos;s a dress in my closet .
no problem . ugh , this is terrible .
i can &apos;t even decide how to wear my hair .
do your feet hurt after wearing heels all night ?
and does dan dance ?
do you prefer lipstick or lip gloss ?
okay , breathe .
lipstick lasts longer , but gloss is more fun .
dan does love to dance ,
but he &apos;s terrible at it ,
so no laughing ,
and your feet won &apos;t hurt as long as you have
just the right amount of champagne .
other than that , just be yourself .
that &apos;s what i did at cotillion ,
and dan and i had the most magical night ever .
and your hair looks great down .
i @-@ i can &apos;t reach louis , and i &apos;ve barely had any time to bond with
princess sophie thanks to cyrus &apos; kibitzing .
she looks like she &apos;s enjoying the conversation .
your stepfather is wonderful , blair .
yes , i loved him at first sight .
no , you didn &apos;t .
his knowledge of birds is magnifique .
perhaps i judge you too harshly after the consulate affair .
cyrus has told me of your job at &quot; w &quot;
and your straight &quot; a &quot; average ,
all while dedicating yourself to avian welfare .
you would never let a duck go hungry .
and you do make louis very happy .
you and louis may make your first formal appearance
as an engaged couple this evening , if you like ,
at constance / st. jude .
your first royal appearance .
i have ways of swaying the court .
there are certain dalliances
that they would rather not have exposed .
it feels like we &apos;re family already .
but what is this ?
it &apos;s true what they say about diamonds .
they cut not only glass but porcelain as well .
did you hear the good news ?
i did .
let us all raise a glass
to the newly reinstated prince
and princess @-@ to @-@ be .
may your lives be as full of love
as the skies are of birds .
we need to talk .
your attempt to destroy me will have to wait .
i have a meeting .
oh , i &apos;m not doing anything ...
except getting you the help you need .
little unsteady , are we ? it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s understandable you &apos;d succumb to substance abuse
after all you &apos;ve been through--
a mother who scammed you for profit ,
a stepmother who cut you out of your own company ,
and , of course , the love of your life
leaving you for a monarchy
smaller than manhattan .
you &apos;re forgetting my uncle
that made me choose between my legacy and the love of my life .
ah , yes . blair did jump at the chance
to sleep with me again , didn &apos;t she ?
hey ! hey ! hey ! what the hell &apos;s going on ? get ahold of yourself .
look who rode in on his high horse
to tell me i told you so .
i &apos;m coming to make sure you &apos;re okay .
i don &apos;t need your pity ! get out of the way or get hurt !
first blair , now me ?
you do need some help .
which is why i &apos;ve brought it .
you can &apos;t be serious .
after everything you &apos;ve done , i &apos;d have to be insane
to not want to beat the crap out of you .
yeah , well , they have experts who &apos;ll decide that .
now you either go with these gentlemen ,
or i &apos;ll call the cops and file a civil suit against you .
sorry , man . you should go .
it &apos;s the only way .
nathaniel , you &apos;re making a grave mistake .
don &apos;t touch the suit !
whoa , whoa , whoa . sedate him if necessary now .
oh , and i guess you won &apos;t be needing this .
and remember , it only works if you work it .
we hear one bass is hitting bottom .
nicely played .
feel free to take whatever you want .
including precious works of art .
looks like the hotel
isn &apos;t the only charles that needs rehab .
hey . what &apos;d i miss ?
oh , cyrus charmed the princess
into returning louis to the throne .
but he &apos;s upstairs waiting to talk ,
and he didn &apos;t seem happy .
so i should probably go .
b. , i know you don &apos;t believe me ,
but no matter how much we fight ,
all i &apos;ve ever wanted for you is true love .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry that it took me so long to realize that .
you--you deserve this .
it &apos;s not as if i haven &apos;t done my share of subversion .
penelope would &apos;ve gotten far too much satisfaction
out of being the maid of honor .
spotted-- a lush headed for lockdown .
let &apos;s hope this bass can survive on dry land .
you okay ?
i know i shouldn &apos;t care , but i &apos;m worried about him .
not tonight . go be a princess .
rehab is probably the safest place for chuck
and your engagement .
hey , you came .
so did you .
i mean , that &apos;s--that &apos;s all right , right ? we &apos;re good ?
yeah . i mean , blair &apos;s getting engaged ,
and--and you &apos;re taking charlie to her first black tie event .
so ... seems everyone &apos;s moving on .
thank you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry it took me so long .
but now we can finally celebrate you getting back
your rightful place in your family and the country .
blair , i know you saw chuck .
well , i ...
i wanted him to hear about our engagement from me .
twice ?
and i had to warn him that his evil uncle was in town .
all of which sounds very noble ,
so why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you-- you know we have a history ,
so i was worried that ...
you &apos;d think it meant more than it did .
i saw him before i came here .
if he told you something happened , he &apos;s lying .
he &apos;s just trying to get you to leave me .
i saw his hand .
it &apos;s not the ring that cut your face .
blair , how can you lie
to protect someone who hurt you ?
since i &apos;m not seeing him again ,
there &apos;s no reason to earrass him .
i think you &apos;re the one who &apos;s embarrassed .
you have your own dark side .
i understand if you want to end it .
it &apos;s very unbecoming of a princess .
i want you , blair .
but the only way it will work is
if you show me all of the parts of yourself ,
even the ones you &apos;re ashamed of .
maybe if we don &apos;t talk about them ,
they &apos;ll just go away ?
i hope you &apos;ll join me at this party
to make your formal debut .
if you &apos;re not ready to share your life-- all of it--
don &apos;t show up .
i &apos;ll leave with my mother tonight .
hey , i &apos;m worried about charlie . she should be here by now .
forget i asked .
take your coat ?
that &apos;s my dress .
gentlemen .
what the hell is going on ?
divine intervention ... if you consider satan divine .
you did get in one good punch .
it was a long time coming .
he was the one who reached out to me to help .
you see , as much as i love to screw with my nephew ,
your using me to do it just didn &apos;t sit right .
so on that tape you just put in your jacket pocket ...
i mean , i knew you didn &apos;t just want to read
your cheating wife &apos;s love letters .
all that was in that box was evidence against my father .
even if he went to the authorities ,
the implications are limited on a dead man .
so we played follow the leader .
unless you &apos;re into arson porn ,
there &apos;s obviously something else of interest on that tape .
bart murdered my wife .
i can take my story to the press .
first , you &apos;ll stay for the viewing .
the time code is after my father left the building .
you &apos;re the one who locked the doors .
my father didn &apos;t set the fire that killed your wife .
you did .
hey , you look great .
you want to , uh , you wanna grab a drink before we go ?
ahem . you should have asked me
if you wanted to wear my cotillion dress .
i mean , you can borrow anything you want ,
but you do need to say something .
this isn &apos;t your dress .
i got this at nina ricci , remember ?
you do have a lot of dresses , serena .
pamela dennis made it especially for me .
i think i would know ,
and so should you , since you were my date .
uh , i bought this myself . i wouldn &apos;t steal from you .
oh , okay , then let &apos;s see the label .
well , it &apos;s ... in your mom &apos;s garbage .
it was jabbing me in the back .
i mean , i think i still have the red mark if you wanna see that .
no , no , whoa , whoa . stop , stop , stop . come on .
there are a million gold dresses .
yeah , but there &apos;s only one with a pamela dennis label cut out .
take it off .
this is obviously a misunderstanding .
why are you defending her ?
you are not leaving here in that .
if you didn &apos;t want me to go to the party with dan ,
you didn &apos;t have to humiliate me .
okay , charlie , this has nothing to do with dan .
good . then you won &apos;t mind
if we leave together ... now .
you know , i was trying to take it slow with charlie
because i value our friendship so much , but ...
can we just call the cops ?
i &apos;m hungry , and all you seem to have are olives and hallucinogenic mushrooms .
you have to believe me . it was an accident .
bart and i were partners .
i had proof that he was planning the fire ,
so when i found out he was sleeping with avery ,
it was the perfect setup .
i was trying to keep my family together .
by killing the mother of your child ?
i swear to you , i thought it was bart in that building .
i knew no matter what i said , he would never let avery go .
it sounds crazy , but ... i still loved her .
and she loved you ?
i read the letter she wrote to my father ending things .
that letter was for me .
bart called and said we needed to talk ,
that i should meet him at the building .
that was when i decided that he wouldn &apos;t be leaving .
that &apos;s what avery and my father were arguing about on the tape ?
she wanted to tell you in person she loved him .
unless we &apos;re close to the end of this sob story ,
i &apos;m gonna order room service , okay ?
your father and i made an agreement .
i would keep the proof
of his involvement in the fire a secret .
i would give him the company , the insurance money ,
and go back to chicago .
and he would say that he was responsible for the accident .
he always felt guilty about avery being there .
i can &apos;t choose my entree with hallmark hall of fame
playing in the background . i &apos;m calling the cops .
please .
i &apos;ll pay .
i &apos;ll give you thorpe enterprises ,
anything you want .
but i can &apos;t let raina find out what i did .
i &apos;ll give you the same deal he did .
oh , hey , girls ,
can we at least get my plane fare home out of this ?
get out of new york and never come back .
thank you .
if raina ever found out , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do .
blintz ?
no , thank you . i &apos;ve lost my appetite .
well , how is that possible ?
you &apos;re returning to your alma mater
as the princess bride @-@ to @-@ be .
you and louis are practically giddy about each other .
not when he finds out who i really am .
you mean a brilliant and beautiful and ...
remarkably @-@ strong- for @-@ her @-@ stature young woman ?
you may not be aware of this ,
but it &apos;s not all light and bright in here .
there are some places devoid of even a hint of sparkle .
louis will love those , too , one would hope .
chuck was the only one who ever did ,
but he couldn &apos;t see the rest .
louis says he wants it all ,
but , ugh , what kind of a princess schemes
and plays sex games
and dreams herself into old hollywood movies ?
well , uh , pretending as your stepfather
that i didn &apos;t hear the sex games part ,
the truth is ...
the only way that you &apos;re gonna know
if louis is the one
is to tell him everything .
but what if he doesn &apos;t love me after i do ?
take it from someone
who is head over heels for a waldorf woman ...
even everything is not enough .
you &apos;re late .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . something came up .
it was really important , but not that late . what &apos;s wrong ?
jack bass called . he &apos;s backing out of the whole plan ,
says he just used me for the free flight .
well , that &apos;s jack for you .
i told you he couldn &apos;t be trusted .
really ? we &apos;re talking about my payback for my mother &apos;s death ,
and you &apos;re &quot; i told you so &quot; -ing me ?
raina , punishing chuck &apos;s not gonna bring your mom back .
chuck knew bart murdered my mother , and he sat there
and watched me get my hopes up about that waitress ,
and he tried to ruin my relationship with my father .
he should pay for that .
okay , i know you &apos;re upset , but you have to
trust me on this . chuck didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
first jack , now you ?
what the hell &apos;s going on , nate ?
i just think you &apos;ve been through enough pain
without digging up more .
i am not stopping until chuck feels as bad as i do .
chuck &apos;s father didn &apos;t kill your mother .
yours did .
you gotta take that ?
um ... no .
they say love is the best medicine--
that is , unless you don &apos;t take it .
your dad was a nasty son of a bitch ,
but i never thought for a second he &apos;d actually gone o.j.
well , thank you for using your evil powers for good this time .
ah , it was selfish , really .
i didn &apos;t want anyone else playing with my punching bag .
dysfunction is best kept in the family . it &apos;s true .
plus what would i want with a company
someone else owns half of , or a building in brooklyn ?
now if you still had blair , things might be different .
on that note , i &apos;m going to cut this reunion short
and try to find her before the nice guy actually wins .
i &apos;m counting on you not to defile the bass name
and lose her to a family of titled circus performers .
i know what you did , dad .
honey , what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re the reason my mother is dead .
did , uh , chuck bass tell you that ?
he &apos;s lying .
he &apos;s trying to cover his own guilt .
why don &apos;t i come and take you to dinner ,
and , uh , we can talk about it ?
don &apos;t come near me .
the only one lying is you , my whole life .
raina , please .
you &apos;re as dead to me as my mother is .
thanks for coming .
i couldn &apos;t resist finding out
what you think we have in common ,
but unless it includes an apology i &apos;m not staying .
you accused me of getting charlie to turn dan against you .
well , she just did the same thing to me .
you think blair &apos;s behind it ?
i mean , dan &apos;s a good kisser , but that good ?
it &apos;s waldorf @-@ level scheming ,
but blair &apos;s in love with her prince . this was all charlie .
hey , serena and ... vanessa ? i &apos;m not even gonna ask
what the two of you are doing together ,
but have either of you seen charlie ?
thank you .
i don &apos;t know why being back here
makes me feel like i &apos;m on the outside again . oh .
oh , you know why ? &apos; cause you &apos;re the only one talking to me .
what &apos;s up , kati , is ? nice to see you girls back together again ,
still dressing alike .
do you hear something ?
no , nothing .
come on . you must have had some fun in high school .
mm , not in actual school , no .
so you never did anything crazy
like blow up a toilet or spray paint lockers
or ... try to get some behind the bleachers ?
no , i was pretty much the anti @-@ crazy .
we &apos;re gonna have to fix that .
you know , i was in here once after a swimming pool incident .
it was not the good kind of crazy .
well ... that kind is better .
you shouldn &apos;t leave high school without doing it on a desk .
you call me serena .
what ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait , wait a second .
i think maybe this is not a great idea .
queller is not known for her sense of humor , and , um ...
why don &apos;t you get dressed ?
and i &apos;ll meet you outside .
oh , have you seen a prince ?
yes , i am engaged to him ,
and you should be green with envy ...
but i don &apos;t have time to make you wallow in it
because i have to take this call . hello ?
what ?
of course .
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
serena &apos;s cousin . thank god .
uh , i just got a call that chuck needs me .
when louis arrives , will you tell him that i was here and that i &apos;ll be back ?
whatever you do , don &apos;t let him leave .
a dream is just a dream , or is it ?
so when you say charlie went off her medication ,
you don &apos;t mean because the doctors told her to ?
no , her mother said it happened once before
last time she was happy . ended pretty badly .
a place where fantasy and reality collide .
chuck bass . what a disappointment .
i was rooting for you .
have you seen the real blair ?
don &apos;t you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ? you lost her to the prince .
not yet , i haven &apos;t .
i told you he wouldn &apos;t let her get away .
everything you ever wanted seems possible .
oh ! excuse me , sir . someone called me from the building
and--and told me that chuck bass was up here .
he was threatening to jump and asking for me .
i &apos;m blair waldorf .
until you realize
the nightmare &apos;s just beginning .
