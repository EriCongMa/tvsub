here you go .
you got everything out of your cell ?
yeah , yeah .
hey , you finally made bail . huh , kid ?
yeah . thought i &apos;d never get out of this hell hole .
here , fill out and sign your inventory and property receipt ,
then you can change your clothes
in the bathroom down the hall on the left .
hey . don &apos;t let me see you in here again .
you won &apos;t .
all right .
&quot; your own personal sleep coach &quot; ?
why does jane need a sleep coach ,
and what &apos;s a &quot; zq &quot; ?
oh , this machine measures r.e.m. --
rapid eye movement .
see , you just wear this while you sleep ,
and it calculates your sleep cycles .
she &apos;ll never get married . send it back .
okay .
then what am i gonna get her for her birthday ?
oprah says you should give to charity .
that &apos;s a good idea .
yeah , but it &apos;s not much of a gift
unless you give jane the tax deduction .
so , i &apos;m gonna go to the party store .
we &apos;re gonna have a surprise party .
and i am gonna celebrate even if jane doesn &apos;t like it .
good luck with that . you know she hates surprises .
hi . come in .
um , i &apos;m sorry . uh , what are you doing down here ?
oh , i &apos;m assisting frankie with his anxiety .
sweetheart , why are you anxious ?
is it because you put on a little weight ?
what ?
no ! ma -- i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t put on any weight .
it &apos;s muscle , so ...
if you say so .
can you go ?
i @-@ i &apos;m having my detectives exam today ,
and dr . isles is giving me some relaxation tips .
good luck , honey .
i &apos;m gonna fail .
no , you &apos;re not .
i have been reading the mayo clinic research
on treating anxiety through hypnosis .
sit down .
okay .
now , close your eyes .
you two should at least close the blinds .
that &apos;s a very good idea .
it &apos;s not what you think .
i know . i just bumped into ma .
you better kill on that exam today , little brother .
there &apos;s nothing like a little more pressure .
come on .
there &apos;s been a stabbing at the brimmer street jail .
victim probably won &apos;t survive his wounds . let &apos;s go .
no , that &apos;s okay . i didn &apos;t want to be a detective anyway .
then why is he taking the exam ?
that &apos;s sarcasm .
using irony to convey contempt ?
are you trying to drive me crazy ?
no !
well , what did i say ?
boston homicide . we &apos;ve been called in by the warden .
yeah , i know . warden price will be here in a second .
take off your shoes and your jacket .
give me your bags .
warden price , you have visitors ?
we need to get into the infirmary and talk to the victim .
you need to go through full security , detective .
this is bullshit .
they &apos;re very thorough here .
reminds me of when i flew to tel aviv .
price used to be a big @-@ time defense attorney .
before he used his juice to get this job ...
... korsak and i went up against him in a few murder trials .
we beat him every time . he hates us .
she needs a pat @-@ down .
oh , come on . she &apos;s the chief medical examiner .
turn around .
spread your legs .
well , i couldn &apos;t possibly hide anything -- up there !
surrender your weapon .
i know the drill .
you making this personal only wastes precious time .
this isn &apos;t personal , detective .
warden price .
okay .
stabbing victim was just pronounced .
great -- thanks for hurrying
so we could talk to him before he died .
you knew him ?
yeah . his name &apos;s graham randall . he was only 22 .
i just processed him . he made bail this morning .
poor kid .
and how long was he here ?
three weeks .
on what charge ?
94c @-@ 34 .
possession of class &quot; b &quot; cocaine . that &apos;s a misdemeanor .
he was being held here until he made the $ 5,000 bail .
looks like it cost him his life .
this is about three liters of blood .
well , i &apos;m surprised he made it to the infirmary .
only because he was young and healthy .
all right . so , no camera in here ?
we don &apos;t have them in the release areas .
well , you might want to re @-@ think that .
i &apos;ll need graham &apos;s records .
once i see the appropriate subpoena .
you &apos;re really gonna make it harder for us
to find this kid &apos;s killer ?
because whether you like it or not ,
you &apos;re on our side now , counselor .
you seem a little hysterical .
did you really just say --
did he really just say that ?
jane , why don &apos;t we go take a look at the body ?
it &apos;s a good thing my gun is locked up . god !
when did you start patting down police officers , price ?
it &apos;s standard for mid @-@ level @-@ security jails .
yeah , in kabul .
korsak , will you come with me to view the body ?
frost , can you start working on getting subpoenas ?
price being a dick ?
yes .
he called me &quot; hysterical . &quot;
i &apos;m surprised his balls aren &apos;t in his throat right now .
no kidding .
he bled out .
two stab wounds to each of his kidneys .
it &apos;s an excruciating way to die .
yeah , but quick . all you need is a shiv .
they practically teach it in here .
any idea what the shiv was made of ?
no . looks more like puncture wounds .
the edges are surprisingly clean .
something very sharp .
like jane .
what the hell ?
do your hands hurt , jane ?
no . it &apos;s like it never happened .
well , as long as you &apos;re here , come closer .
i have so much to tell you , jane ...
and so little time .
what &apos;s he doing here in the jail infirmary ?
he killed nine people , price !
he &apos;s supposed to be in a maximum @-@ security unit !
he &apos;s receiving treatment for cancer
at boston general &apos;s oncology unit .
you &apos;re moving him back and forth ? !
even prisoners are entitled to medical care , detective .
you know he escaped before -- by faking appendicitis !
you think i &apos;m faking cancer ?
do you want to see what i &apos;m reading ?
i love murder mysteries . don &apos;t you ?
oh , shut up !
i want to see his medical records .
jane is right --
he went to medical school . he could be faking .
not without his permission .
you &apos;re gonna sign a form that lets us
look at your medical records , you piece of crap .
now , jane ...
you know that &apos;s too private ,
even between us .
come closer .
oh , son of a bitch .
don &apos;t you want to hear something very interesting ?
something very , very bad that i did ?
you wouldn &apos;t want me to die before i told you ,
now , would you , jane ?
don &apos;t get sucked in , jane .
nobody knows , jane -- nobody knows ,
but i &apos;ll tell you .
and the good doctor can hear , too .
but the fat cop -- get him out of here .
korsak ...
... wait for me outside .
please .
tape this .
talk .
you have my attention for 30 seconds .
do you remember where you were in the fall of &apos; 05 ?
no .
the leaves were beautiful .
even the weeping willows turned yellow that year .
you said that you did something very bad .
did you murder someone in the fall of &apos; 05 ?
i love the feel of velvet .
virgin white velvet .
a young eagle lost its family of four .
did you know that eagles don &apos;t drink water ?
i &apos;ll bet you did , dr. isles .
did you come through the westgate ?
it is possible that the cancer
has metastasized into his brain .
you don &apos;t think he knows what he &apos;s talking about ?
i don &apos;t know , maura .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re dying .
it &apos;s something very bad that i did , jane .
so do one good thing with your life --
and if you &apos;re gonna confess to something ,
do it straight up so i can bring a family some peace .
i &apos;m not looking for peace . mnh @-@ mnh .
and i &apos;m bored talking with you .
are you okay ?
why , because i saw my own personal boogeyman today ?
no .
god -- i &apos;m gonna have nightmares for months !
really ?
do you think you might need your own personal sleep coach ?
what ?
it &apos;s a good thing they didn &apos;t search us
on the way out .
maura , what are you doing ?
you stole a vial of hoyt &apos;s blood ?
well ... technically , sort of .
gosh , i guess is stealing .
if he files charges , i &apos;ll be your character witness .
i don &apos;t want to get arrested !
you &apos;re not gonna get arrested .
take it to the crime lab .
i only need enough to do a staining ,
just to see if cancer cells are present .
great . &quot; scientific inquiry . &quot; not stealing . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes , i &apos;m positive .
and e @-@ mail me the video you took with the phone , okay ?
okay .
jane !
yeah !
got graham &apos;s bureau of probation records .
all of his personal belongings , too .
price can &apos;t say no to a subpoena .
and we recovered three shivs from separate cells .
nice , let &apos;s take them to maura --
see if one of them is the murder weapon .
okay , why is there a tort law book in his things ?
he was in for three weeks .
how &apos;d he plan to be a jailhouse lawyer ?
well , he worked in the library . maybe he read everything else .
did you find anything in his file ?
college graduate . no priors .
he ran a red light ,
got caught with a couple grams of cocaine .
so who &apos;d he piss off in jail ?
maura , did you find a shiv to match his wounds ?
well ...
this is a sharpened prison toothbrush .
notice the knitted handle .
mm . there &apos;s a new take on an old favorite .
was that the murder weapon ?
no .
this one appears to have been made
with a straightened chain @-@ link fence .
hmm . was that it ?
no .
this is a ballpoint pen embedded with a disposable razor .
was that the murder weapon ?
definitely not .
okay , what &apos;s with the show @-@ and @-@ tell ?
i just think it &apos;s so interesting , don &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s a little like &quot; project runway . &quot;
you know , they -- they move into the jail ,
they get the same items ,
but they all fashion different homemade shivs .
really ?
well , i think it &apos;s interesting .
you weren &apos;t even gonna tell me ?
about what ?
about hoyt !
shh !
i don &apos;t want ma to hear -- she &apos;ll flip out .
hi , there , you two !
hey , ma .
someone &apos;s gonna tell her . it &apos;s all over headquarters .
we &apos;ll give her something bigger to think about
so she doesn &apos;t have time to gossip .
like what ?
like ...
i know she &apos;s throwing me a surprise party .
no , she &apos;s not .
tell her i want a &quot; my pretty pony &quot; party .
&quot; my pretty pony &quot; ?
so , you &apos;re turning 9 again ?
they &apos;ve been discontinued .
she &apos;ll drive all over town looking for pony party supplies .
okay .
no , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! i forgot . i &apos;m sorry .
how &apos;d you do on the exam ?
terrible . i bombed .
no , you didn &apos;t . all right ?
everybody thinks they bombed .
i thougit bombed .
yeah , well , did .
i &apos;m gonna be on patrol for the rest of my life .
no , you &apos;re not . come on .
hey , what &apos;s the matter with you two ?
you look like you lost your favorite pair of mittens .
mittens ? really ? ma .
how about a cream cheese and jelly sandwich ?
that &apos;ll make you feel better .
no .
no , thanks , ma .
come on . hey --
whoa . don &apos;t have to take it out on her .
she told me i looked fat .
i said you put on muscle weight !
no , she didn &apos;t .
you do look kind of chunky .
shut up .
ow ! nice muscles .
do you remember where you were in the fall of &apos; 05 ?
he says something about eagles like right ... here .
a young eagle lost its family of four .
did you know that eagles don &apos;t drink water ?
why eagles ?
why are you doing that now ?
yeah , that &apos;s a good question .
i just got off the phone with warden price .
sean , you know he &apos;s posturing because he &apos;s gonna run for office .
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s an asshole . but he had a good point .
rizzoli , you &apos;re supposed to be solving an inmate &apos;s murder ,
not listening to some crackpot serial killer --
with all due respect for what you went through .
i &apos;m sorry . i have been working the case .
yeah ? which case ?
graham randall &apos;s mother is here .
how about you tell me who killed
that kid , rizzoli . hmm ?
korsak ...
... can you take this with frost ?
maura just found something in the body .
sure .
i couldn &apos;t get the bail money together .
$ 5,000 was just too much for me to raise .
but graham said he was okay .
when did you last talk to him ?
he called me yesterday .
graham said an angel would be coming by with his bail .
an &quot; angel &quot; paid your son &apos;s bail ? who ?
he said he was a lawyer .
he showed up at my door
about an hour after graham called
with an envelope full of money .
that strike you as odd -- a stranger just showing up ,
giving you that much cash ?
i didn &apos;t care where it came from .
i just knew my prayers had been answered .
i could get my son out of jail .
do you know why graham ...
had a law book with him ?
he was going back to boston college .
he had been accepted to the law school .
and i thought everything was finally gonna be okay .
i may have found a bowel obstruction .
hold your breath . this will smell .
come on , maura --
i don &apos;t need to see -- or smell -- this .
oh , my god .
what ?
he swallowed something .
what is it ? dope ?
let &apos;s see .
no . teeth .
what the hell ?
from different people .
these two are both number 8s ,
adult incisors , and the other two are number 29s ,
pre @-@ molar bicuspids .
they &apos;re primary teeth , jane .
you mean from children ?
yeah .
they were all removed perimortem .
before they died .
graham randall was a mule ,
smuggling out a balloon full of human teeth --
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i &apos;ll do dna testing on each one .
okay , they could hear that on the fourth floor .
well , i turned up the audio
so that i could hear hoyt &apos;s
blood results when they came in .
a hot @-@ air balloon ride ?
well , it &apos;s a rather unfortunate coincidence
that i just found a balloon full of teeth today ,
but this is completely different .
i had zero interest in a balloon ride before the teeth .
well , then , what am i gonna get you for your birthday ?
what is that , the duck boat ride ?
no . that &apos;s hoyt &apos;s blood results .
he has cancer .
pancreatic . stage iv . he &apos;s definitely dying .
okay , well , that &apos;s the only birthday present i need .
teeth .
yeah .
four of them .
maura found them in graham &apos;s intestines .
he swallowed them . question is , why ?
you can get anything in and out of prisons .
but who smuggles out teeth ?
yeah , this is a weird one .
okay , stranger bails out our victim
a few hours before he &apos;s stabbed to death .
mother said he had a law book
because he was going to law school at boston college .
korsak ...
b.c. &apos; s mascot is an eagle .
so ?
so ,
that &apos;s the connection to hoyt .
he was just playing me .
&quot; where were you in the fall of &apos; 05 &quot; ?
maybe that &apos;s where we should be looking .
at cold cases ? you heard cavanaugh --
solve this kid &apos;s murder .
hoyt &apos;s involved .
did you find anything that put graham anywhere near hoyt ?
maybe his library runs ,
but the prison doesn &apos;t keep any records .
jane , hoyt is dying of cancer .
he didn &apos;t stab graham randall .
yeah , but maybe he had somebody else do it .
he &apos;s already had two apprentices ,
made them kill for him .
you think graham was hoyt &apos;s apprentice ?
i don &apos;t know .
frost , stay here .
just call me if cavanaugh
comes looking for us .
who &apos;s &quot; us &quot; ?
you and me .
where are &quot; we &quot; going ?
to the basement , to look at cold cases .
you &apos;re going ?
you know how persuasive she can be .
korsak !
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
you think this is a wild @-@ goose chase , don &apos;t you ?
hey , i &apos;m here , okay ?
if there &apos;s something to find ,
we &apos;ll find it .
thanks , korsak .
hey ...
i know what you went through .
what we went through .
nothing .
we &apos;ve been through every unsolved murder
from 2004 to 2006 .
let &apos;s call it a night , jane .
you go . i &apos;m gonna stay .
jane
there &apos;s something here !
no .
there isn &apos;t .
go home . get some sleep .
we &apos;ll tackle graham &apos;s murder in the morning .
good night .
you think she &apos;s still downstairs ?
i &apos;ll go check .
i found it ! i found it .
okay , hoyt said ,
&quot; a young eagle had lost its family . &quot;
&quot; lost . &quot;
that &apos;s why we couldn &apos;t find anything .
so i finally went to missing persons .
and found a missing family of four from the fall of &apos; 05 .
oh , my god , jane .
the wilson family -- father , mother , two daughters .
mm @-@ hmm . and a son .
family dropped him off at college
and were never heard from again .
this is friggin &apos; tragic --
son was the only suspect in their disappearance .
about to start his first semester at boston college .
yeah , the same college where
our victim , graham randall ,
was headed to this fall .
i want to go back and talk to hoyt .
cavanaugh gave us our marching orders --
work on graham ,
stay away from hoyt .
we need more .
okay .
dr. wilson was a professor
at the emory school of medicine ,
same medical school that hoyt went to .
that &apos;s another connection to hoyt .
do we even know that hoyt
was in boston in &apos; 05 ?
frost , check with the b.c. campus police .
see if hoyt had any connection
to that college in 2005 .
the thing is , it &apos;s all speculation
unless we can link
those teeth to the wilsons &apos; dna .
yeah , well , we find the son ,
we compare his dna .
can you find a driver &apos;s license for jacob wilson ?
yeah .
that was easy .
he still lives in boston .
a cheek swab from jacob will tell us
whether the teeth that graham smuggled out of jail
belong to the wilsons .
yeah , and if they do ,
then both these cases
got &quot; hoyt &quot; written all over them .
i &apos;m sorry . thank you .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m used to being interrogated by the police .
first time you wanted my dna , though .
why now ?
we , uh , have found some new evidence
that could help us solve this case .
what evidence ?
we can &apos;t say .
this is your family ?
yeah .
this is the last time i saw them .
my new roommate took that picture .
the youngest girl is in a white velvet headband .
hoyt said that he loved the feel of white velvet .
how fast can you check the dna ?
i &apos;ll push it right through .
i thought about lying ,
saying i had something to do with the disappearance ,
just to get you guys to look for them .
we know you didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you do ?
we need you to tell us about
the last day you saw your family .
i , uh ... was about to start college ...
talk us through that day ,
everything you can remember .
we went to the family pancake breakfast ,
then a campus blood drive .
my dad was big on donating blood .
then they took me back to my dorm room ...
and they said goodbye .
do the westgate woods near the b.c. campus mean anything to you ?
yeah . my mom and dad met there .
they both went to b.c.
got something .
excuse me .
hoyt was in boston in &apos; 05 .
b.c. police went
through their security log .
hoyt was working as a phlebotomist for
a mobile blood drive .
nice work , frost .
jacob ...
does this man look familiar to you ?
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
dig into your memory .
anything unusual happen
at that blood drive ?
the only thing that seemed weird was
my dad talked to the guy
who drew his blood for a while .
did he say what they talked about ?
the guy was one of his students .
could this be the man that
your father recognized as a student
that he taught in medical school ?
maybe . yeah .
my dad was surprised the guy
ended up in a dead @-@ end job .
okay . thank you , jacob .
please ...
i know they &apos;re dead .
did he do it ?
i just can &apos;t take not knowing anymore .
i won &apos;t stop looking for them
until we find them .
okay ?
okay .
hoyt is behind the murder of graham randall
and the disappearancerder of the wilson family .
i need talk to him .
you can forget that , rizzoli .
there ain &apos;t a chance in hell
warden price &apos;s gonna let you go at hoyt again .
and frankly , i wouldn &apos;t either .
you &apos;re too close to this .
sean , hoyt &apos;s given us
clues we can &apos;t ignore .
but you haven &apos;t given me anything that proves
he had anything to do with this family &apos;s disappearance .
he could just be yanking your chain .
you think he was yanking graham &apos;s
when he gave him a balloon full of teeth to swallow ?
trophies from his victims
that somebody smuggled into jail for him ?
you don &apos;t know who those teeth belong to , vince .
yet ! okay , fine .
if you won &apos;t let me talk to hoyt ,
then , please , just listen to our theory .
did you come through the westgate ?
westgate park .
right near b.c.
and ?
and we think that hoyt &apos;s ego got bruised
when he ran into his old professor --
so he followed the family into the park and murdered them .
we think he dumped their bodies somewhere in that park .
this park is over four acres of land .
and even with cadaver dogs , you &apos;ve got to narrow the search .
what about using gprs ?
ground @-@ penetrating radar ?
you &apos;re talking about a $ 100,000 fishing expedition .
and i still don &apos;t get what one case has to do with the other .
and we won &apos;t unless we go look for those bodies .
come in .
i &apos;ve got the dna results .
i know you &apos;ve been waiting for them .
it &apos;s the wilsons . can we go fishing now ?
come on . find something . damn it .
we &apos;ve been out here eight hours , rizzoli --
nothing -- no sign of any human remains .
those bodies are out here . we got to keep looking .
we &apos;ve combed all four acres .
crap . press .
we &apos;re done here .
hey , rizzoli .
what are you digging in westgate park for ?
we &apos;re , uh , looking up a lead in a cold case .
aw , come on , an official at the jail told us
you &apos;re not out here looking for graham randall &apos;s killer .
i don &apos;t have a comment on the randall case .
oh , so a prisoner who gets murdered in jail , rizzoli --
that &apos;s not important to you ?
come on , come on , come on . come on .
an &quot; official at the jail . &quot; gee , i wonder who that is .
warden price .
i &apos;d like to hand him nuts right about now !
eagles , westgate ...
leaves , white velvet ...
where are they ?
if you over @-@ secrete glucocorticoids
you won &apos;t be able to think .
try to relax .
oh , yeah , sure . i know --
why don &apos;t we take a midnight hot @-@ air @-@ balloon ride ?
i thought it would be a unique experience , okay ?
okay ? but that &apos;s fine . it &apos;s all right .
you know , just save me a lot of agony ,
and tell me what you want .
a horse .
really ?
yes .
a thoroughbred . and i &apos;ll name him walter .
and he can live here in the apartment , with me ,
and i &apos;ll ride him every day to work .
a lot of people wouldn &apos;t put up with your abuse .
okay , don &apos;t get me anything . pretend it &apos;s not my birthday .
hate my birthday .
well , what is the big whoop ?
i mean , why can &apos;t you just let people
do something nice for you ?
did you just say , &quot; what &apos;s the big whoop &quot; ?
what &apos;s wrong with that expression ?
nothing . i love it .
i &apos;m gonna say it all the time now .
what &apos;s the big whoop ?
okay , well , what is it ?
all right , fine -- you want to know why i don &apos;t like my birthday ?
because it never turns out the way i imagined it .
and you don &apos;t like to be disappointed .
yeah .
help me find the wilsons .
the leaves were beautiful .
even the weeping willows turned yellow that year .
maybe that &apos;s what we missed -- the weeping willows .
no . i didn &apos;t miss anything .
and there are no weeping willows in westgate park .
well , many of them died from crown gall .
and i need to know this because ... ?
well , weeping willows grow near water ...
lakes or ponds .
hoyt said ...
&quot; eagles don &apos;t drink water . &quot;
well , they get most of their hydration from their diet ,
but they do on occasion .
no , he said , did you go through westgate ?
that &apos;s it !
not in the park -- leaving the park !
well , who are you calling ?
korsak .
i know where the wilsons are .
1996 baby blue mercury wagon . that &apos;s the wilsons &apos; car .
they were in this pond the whole time .
hoyt even put &apos; em in their seats .
damn .
that &apos;s how they disappeared off the face of the earth .
we still have to tie hoyt to graham &apos;s murder .
what about the bail money ?
probably still with the bail commissioner .
i &apos;ll go check it out .
okay .
why would hoyt decide to tell me now ?
bastard just wants the credit for this before he dies .
yeah , maybe .
it &apos;s my opinion ,
based on the tool marks i &apos;m finding
on all the c @-@ 3 vertebrae , that the victims
suffered a lateral incised wound ...
that would have encompassed
both left and right carotids and jugulars .
so their throats were slit .
yes .
probably just eating sandwiches ,
enjoying a beautiful fall day ,
and hoyt came across them .
my guess is he went after one of the children first ,
used her to keep everybody else in line .
rizzoli .
okay .
and the warden okay &apos;d that ?
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;ll be right there .
hoyt &apos;s dying ,
and he told the guard he wants to see me .
do you think that &apos;s a good idea ?
he says he &apos;s prepared to give up the names and burial sites
of every person he &apos;s murdered .
i &apos;m going with you .
why ?
hoyt &apos;s on a massive dose of morphine .
i might be able to help you navigate what &apos;s true
and what &apos;s drug @-@ induced fantasy .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
bail commissioner didn &apos;t know what to do
with the envelope of bail money after graham was killed ,
so he locked it up .
maybe we can lift prints .
is hoyt lucid ?
doctor said he won &apos;t last through the night .
you got a half @-@ hour with him , understand ?
you don &apos;t tell me how long i can talk to him .
i &apos;ll talk to him till he &apos;s dead
if that means solving one more of his murders .
and i hope that &apos;s not too &quot; hysterical &quot; for you .
just the bail commissioner &apos;s prints .
graham &apos;s angel was too smart
to leave prints on the envelope .
let &apos;s try the money .
we got 50 $ 100 bills here .
let &apos;s do iodine fuming .
why doesn &apos;t she ever talk to me about it ?
what did he do to you , rizzoli ?
a little help down here !
what hoyt did to her , you can &apos;t talk about .
just leave it alone , frost .
you were with her when it happened .
she &apos;s my partner , too , korsak .
you see what it does to her .
i can &apos;t help her if she won &apos;t talk to me .
the only thing that &apos;s gonna help her
is to shovel dirt on that bastard &apos;s grave .
give me the bill on the bottom .
looks like the angel touched the money .
let &apos;s hope so .
probably a thumbprint .
i &apos;ll get it entered into afis .
hoyt .
he &apos;s been in and out of it .
it &apos;s not fair .
maybe he &apos;ll still be able to talk to you .
it &apos;s not fair because ...
how could a person who tortured so many people
get to go out so peacefully ?
jane ...
jane ...
jane ...
come closer .
i have more bad things to tell you .
i &apos;m here .
aah ! get him off me !
i think i &apos;ll watch .
happy birthday , jane .
we got a hit .
who is it ? - candidate -- rod mason ,
brimmer street jail . he &apos;s a guard .
that &apos;s not good , frost .
he &apos;s hoyt &apos;s guard .
damn . rod mason is hoyt &apos;s apprentice .
i &apos;m getting a recording at the jail .
they &apos;re in lockdown .
i was so hoping you were smart enough
to put together my clues .
was it fun ?
like a murder treasure hunt ?
i should have killed you when i had the chance .
yeah . you should have .
the taser .
i could turn it on if you like .
no !
i always finish what i start .
he played you , mason .
just like he plays all his little apprentices .
i &apos;m not the one wearing zip ties , detective .
what was in it for you ?
well ... it was fun .
kid was all proud of himself , you know .
going off to law school . big deal .
idiot was dropping off mystery books for a serial killer .
i love mysteries .
so you were the one that set up his bail .
all he had to do for the 5k was swallow a balloon .
it was too good to be true
when little graham told me he was off to boston college
to be a double eagle .
i knew then that he would be the perfect envelope
for my letter to you .
it &apos;s time .
you killed him .
that &apos;s why the edges of the stab wounds were so clean .
that &apos;s very good , dr. isles .
though rod doesn &apos;t wield his scalpels
with the same finesse ,
he did get graham here
so i could be here with you .
i &apos;m dying , and i want company .
i think i &apos;m gonna take you and dr. isles with me .
hold her down .
no !
i win , jane .
hoyt , don &apos;t you touch her !
you &apos;re gonna feel a little pinch , doctor .
no ! stop it !
shut up !
i win .
and you &apos;re going to hell alone .
you okay , doc ?
you okay ?
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah .
you &apos;re okay .
okay , yeah , yeah -- &quot; surprise &quot; !
hello ?
surprise .
surprise !
god almighty !
i looked everywhere for &quot; my pretty pony . &quot;
i hope this is okay .
this is fantastic , ma . thank you .
happy birthday .
thank you . wow .
dr. finicky drinking beer out of a can ?
and a lot of it after today .
although i can taste the aluminum .
well , i got my wish . hoyt &apos;s dead .
a gift to the world . happy birthday , jane .
what ?
happy birthday .
you got a 96 on your exam ?
oh , yeah , you really bombed it .
he had a pretty good tutor .
why are you taking the credit ?
i taught him everything he knows .
huh ? all right .
all right .
oh , boy . well ...
this looks a lot smaller than
walter the thoroughbred .
i hope you like them .
they &apos;re ...
driving shoes .
racing shoes .
they &apos;re fully lined with fire @-@ resistant dupont nomex .
and ... i need these ...
because ...
racing school ?
you &apos;re sending me to racing school ? !
well , you know , walter &apos;s highest speed
is 40 miles per hour .
and the lamborghini murcilago
lp640 &apos;s highest speed is 211 !
well , do you like it ?
yes ! yes ! thank you so much !

oh my god !
