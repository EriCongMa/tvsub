look out !
oh , my god !
did we hit it ?
looks okay to me .
this is riley . the kealoha &apos;s dog .
babe , we should go .
we can &apos;t just leave him .
hello ?
mrs. kealoha ?
we found riley . are you home ?
hello ?
is anybody home ?
hello ?
mrs. kealoha ?
are you home ?
anybody ?
hello ?
hello ? mrs. kealoha ?
are you home ?
aloha , stevie .
oh . oh , it &apos;s so good to see you , aunt deb .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
oh , honey .
well , it &apos;s good to be seen .
oh , honey , before you ask ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t know where your mother is .
your sister said that you called .
she doesn &apos;t know where doris is , either .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , it &apos;s ...
tell me about your trip . how was it ? was it good ?
it was amazing !
here , i was a little worried because we booked it
after my last round of chemo and i @-@ i didn &apos;t know
if i &apos;d be up to the trip , but , sweetheart ,
that sea air is just what i needed .
treatments were rough , huh ?
kiddo , &quot; rough &quot; doesn &apos;t begin to describe it , but
the doc says the tumor in my brain
has shrunk half its size .
so i guess the poison works .
well , you look great .
a little makeup and a good wig
hides a multitude of sins .
listen , i &apos;m so glad
you decided to fight back , deb .
you can thank leonard for that .
he &apos;s the one who talked me into getting into the ring .
where is he by the way ?
honey ? ooh @-@ hoo . over here .
and you file that subpoena , stan .
your old boss owes you the money .
i thought your boyfriend was a shop teacher .
why &apos;s he , uh ,
why &apos;s he handing out legal advice ?
well , he just likes to be helpful , that &apos;s all .
sweetheart !
darling ?
this is steve .
steve ?
leonard cassano .
nice to meet you , leonard .
welcome to hawaii .
i finally made it to paradise .
honey , we &apos;re on land five minutes already .
when are you gonna give him the news ?
what news ?
well , short version .
leonard popped the question
and i said yes !
you &apos;re engaged ?
yeah .
well , you &apos;ve been dating for a couple months .
what &apos;s the rush ?
oh , my pragmatic nephew .
never one for romance or the grand gesture .
honey , you know that country western song
&quot; live like you were dying &quot; ?
yeah .
well , it makes more sense
when you &apos;re actually dying .
i &apos;ve got my tumor .
leonard is stage iv leukemia .
we &apos;ve got no time to waste .
and i knew deb was the one .
the moment i saw her at that cancer support group .
okay , so you &apos;re gonna have a nice
long engagement though , right ?
make some plans .
plans are made . we &apos;re tying the knot tomorrow at 6 : 00 p.m.
okay , hold on . hold ...
excuse me . hold on just a second now .
because mary will be devastated .
your sister already gave us her blessing .
and she can &apos;t come anyway
because little joanie has an ear infection .
sonny ?
can you do me a solid and grab our bags for us , would you ?
mahalo .
you just made his year .
can &apos;t take it with you , right ?
right .
excuse me for a sec .
yeah , chin .
work . he &apos;s got to go .
that was work .
i got to go .
it &apos;s okay .
we can get ourselves to the hotel .
and you &apos;ll call me later ?
of course .
i love you .
i love you .
leonard , nice to meet you .
pleasure &apos;s all mine .
so , good news is deb &apos;s feeling better and she &apos;s in love .
bad news is you don &apos;t like her boyfriend ...
fiance . fiance . okay ?
soon to be husband . tomorrow actually .
all right ?
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t like him .
there &apos;s something off about him .
off , off . what do you mean &quot; off &quot; ?
he &apos;s a retired teacher and he tips like a rapper .
oh , well , you can &apos;t take it with you , right ?
that &apos;s what he said !
and since when does a retired shop teacher
hand out legal advice ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he &apos;s a big fan of judge judy .
you know what else ?
what ?
his hands .
his hands ?
his hands were smooth . they &apos;re beautiful .
it &apos;s like ...
they should be rough .
he works with tools , right ?
ah , you just said he was retired .
okay , i think personally that you are looking for trouble .
but if you are really concerned ,
i would say maybe put somebody on it , ease your mind .
i already got jerry on it .
oh , mr. conspiracy .
that ought to ease your mind for sure .
nice work .
so , our victim &apos;s names are david and kate kealoha .
it looks like they were sitting down to watch some tv ,
and someone came in the back with a shotgun ,
got very generous with the ammo .
hollow core slugs
filled with buckshot .
designed to do maximum damage .
these people were massacred .
a hyperbolic , and yet also an astute assessment ,
detective williams .
the firepower that was utilized
is a very clear definition of overkill .
what else do we know , max ?
our male victim ,
david kealoha , was first shot
in the back of the head .
he was seated , no defensive wounds .
guy never knew what hit him .
all right , what about the lady ?
the blood spatter on her blouse indicates
she was beside her husband when he was shot .
all right , so her husband &apos;s hit . she stands up , turns around
and immediately takes one center mass .
both shots were fired from the lanai entry as well .
okay , so whoever did this never even came inside .
we &apos;re gonna get no fingerprints , no dna .
good call . so far , csu &apos;s come up empty .
but we &apos;re pulling traffic cam footage ,
hoping that we get a hit on a vehicle .
gentlemen , if there &apos;s nothing else ,
i &apos;ll finish my prelims
and get back to you with a full report later today .
where are the kids ?
slept at a friend &apos;s house last night .
hpd picked them up an hour ago .
travis , jake ?
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett ,
this is detective williams .
why can &apos;t we go inside ?
why can &apos;t we see our parents ?
ah , it &apos;s for your own good .
what about riley ?
our dog . is he okay ?
you still got the dog up top ?
grab the dog , please .
when was the last time you boys saw your parents ?
uh ... around nine last night .
that &apos;s when jake and i went to tai &apos;s house .
tai ?
he &apos;s a friend from school .
okay , you guys , you were there all night ?
yeah , just hanging out as usual .
what does that have to do with anything ?
gentlemen ?
boys , would you excuse us , please ?
i &apos;m eugene goodman , the family attorney .
this is inappropriate .
the boys are obviously distraught .
i &apos;d like to take them with me .
yeah , that &apos;s fine .
uh , we &apos;re gonna need to speak to them a little later .
well , call my office , make an appointment
so i can be present .
what , do you think these boys need an attorney ?
that depends .
are they suspects ?
what &apos;s the matter , boy ?
why &apos;s he acting like that ? what &apos;s wrong with him ?
riley .
hey ! riley !
you think the dog &apos;s trying to tell us something ?
yeah , i do .
杰克 · 卡勒哈
崔维斯 · 卡勒哈
so i ran jake and travis kealoha .
they &apos;ve never been in any trouble before .
and there &apos;s no records of them purchasing a shotgun or shells .
but as it turns out ,
there &apos;s a whole lot of people
who would &apos;ve wanted to see david kealoha dead .
how many &apos;s &quot; a whole lot &quot; ?
about 250 .
250 ?
david kealoha made his money as an investment banker ,
and he was very successful for a long time ,
but then the economy took a downturn .
well , kealoha took some heavy losses ,
but rather than deal with unhappy clients ,
he tried to cover them with an elaborate pyramid scheme .
but of course it all fell apart .
sec was investigating the guy for over a year .
his company went bankrupt--
all the investments are gone .
he ruined a lot of lives .
yeah , and he was going to prison .
the sec was just about to send their evidence
over to the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
within the month , he would have been arrested ,
his accounts frozen ,
and anything he still owned repossessed .
maybe one of kealoha &apos;s swindled clients
didn &apos;t think that was punishment enough
and took matters into his own hands .
yeah , well , most live on the mainland ,
but there is one who &apos;s pretty close to home .
gable children &apos;s trust , that &apos;s tai gable ...
hold on . tai gable ?
that &apos;s the house that jake and travis kealoha spent last night .
yeah . the gables are going through a very nasty divorce .
jason gable , as a part of the settlement ,
agreed to supersize the kid &apos;s college funds .
tai was about eight months away from collecting his .
david kealoha lost all of it .
how much ?
over half a mil .
i know if my best friend &apos;s dad stole my money
i &apos;d be pretty pissed .
a double shotgun blast ?
definitely the work of a pissed @-@ off individual .
tai gable &apos;s mother alibi &apos;d those kids .
i mean , she said all three boys were home from 9 : 00 p.m.
to when hpd woke them up this morning .
steve ... take it from me--
if there &apos;s one thing a teenager knows how to do ,
is sneak out of the house when they want .
but we pulled the traffic footage from around the kealoha house .
tai wasn &apos;t in it .
what about traffic footage from around the gable house ?
hpd &apos;s going through that right now .
we &apos;re gonna go light a fire under them .
all right . get them .
hey . caught these two trying to bust through security out the front .
sorry to pop in unexpectedly ,
but we were across the street at the courthouse
getting our license , so we thought we &apos;d come by and say hi .
i &apos;m glad you did .
i &apos;m so glad that they did , too ,
&apos;cause i get to hear all about their cruise
they just took-- this place is amazing .
they had mini golf ,
zip line , spa treatments .
this guy &apos;s hands-- smoothest hands i ever felt in my entire life .
deb insisted we both get mani @-@ pedis before the ceremony .
danny here was busting my chops .
yeah , he does that .
well , i don &apos;t care .
this is our one and only wedding ,
and i just figured we ought to look our best , hands and feet .
makes sense to me . make sense to you ?
complete sense .
hey , if you &apos;re free for lunch ,
i &apos;m buying , steve .
oh , i &apos;d love it for my two favorite guys
to get to know each other better , huh ?
i would love that , too .
unfortunately , i &apos;m right in the middle of this case , uh , right now .
hey , lou , you remember , uh ...
aunt deb , you remember lou grover ?
oh . yeah , yeah . hi .
and , lou , this is leonard .
leonard , nice to meet you .
lou .
well , i hope maybe you &apos;ll be able to come
to our wedding tomorrow-- royal hawaiian .
what do you mean , &quot; maybe &quot; ?
i wouldn &apos;t miss that for the world .
of course i &apos;ll be there .
thank you .
there you go .
listen , now , that , uh ,
traffic cam thing , it worked out .
okay , we got a lead here . i got a lead on the case .
okay , okay . thank you .
he loves me .
i knew he would .
okay , i don &apos;t know ,
but i think i might have cracked the mystery of the smooth hands .
for you i did that , so ...
you know what ?
thank you .
you @-@ you &apos;re a big help to me , nancy drew .
listen , listen , listen , now .
i just got off the phone with hpd .
this is what they sent me .
now , there &apos;s no clear picture of the driver ,
but i ran the plate .
this car is registered to tai gable .
okay , well , either tai gable is lying to his mother
about going out last night , or she &apos;s lying to you .
well , i say we go ask him .
slow down . what do you think ?
do you take driving lessons from mcgarrett or what ?
you ever been to chicago ?
i &apos;ve been to chicago .
well , in chicago ,
when we tell somebody to drive , this is how we drive .
and in the snow .
steve , he &apos;s making a left on puahi street .
i got him .
move , move , move !
get out of the way !
tai gable ...
you &apos;re under arrest for murder and reckless endangerment .
and messing up my suv .
are you insane , man ?
i had nothing to do with the kealohas getting killed .
then why &apos;d you run ?
when we came to talk to you , you ran .
the customer i was with ,
i was selling him some weed .
tourists rent scoots ,
and sometimes they &apos;re looking to make the drive to laniakea beach
a little bit more scenic ,
if you get my meaning .
please don &apos;t tell my boss .
you ... i &apos;m sorry , you sell people , uh , marijuana ,
and then you rent them scooters ,
and then you let them drive around this island
that they &apos;ve never been on before ,
to crash into things and potentially kill people ?
is that what you &apos;re saying to me ?
we &apos;re telling your boss .
ah , man , this day is the worst .
today is worse than when mr. kealoha
stole half a million dollars from you ?
he blew my college fund . so what ?
my dad &apos;s got plenty more where that came from .
i &apos;m not exactly university material , man .
oh , my god .
okay , genius .
we still have to know where you were last night .
me ?
no , i want to know where he was last night .
yes , you .
nowhere .
hey , cheech .
we got traffic video of your car
blowing a red light at 20 after midnight .
where were you ?
maybe , but it wasn &apos;t me driving it .
i smoked a bowl and fell asleep at 11 : 00 .
anyone in the house could have taken my ride once i was asleep .
like jake and travis ?
they ever borrow your car without asking ?
yeah .
sometimes .
sometimes .
okay .
thank you for bringing tai home .
i promise i &apos;ll speak to him about the drugs .
although , in colorado , it is legal now .
not if you &apos;re under 21 , and not to sell .
it &apos;s been hard on tai .
both my kids .
with their father leaving last year , so ...
i just try to be ...
understanding .
okay . i get it .
you think , uh , maybe they need a friend more than a mother .
yeah . exactly .
i disagree .
don &apos;t cover for your son .
don &apos;t cover for the kealoha boys , either .
i don &apos;t understand .
we spoke to their lawyer .
both jake and travis say
they didn &apos;t take tai &apos;s car out last night .
so , are you saying that they &apos;re lying ?
well , you know , if you didn &apos;t take it , tai didn &apos;t take it ,
they didn &apos;t take it , somebody &apos;s lying .
jake and travis are good kids .
yeah , well , sometimes good kids have bad problems , right ?
jake said they stayed here a lot .
was there , uh , trouble at home ?
they just need a break sometimes .
their dad could be ... demanding .
demanding in what way ?
david wanted them to be successful .
and for him , success meant making tons of money .
nothing was worth doing if you didn &apos;t get paid .
what about their mother ?
kate was more sensitive .
she had a conscience .
when we found out
that david had stolen my kids &apos; college fund , it was kate
who came over here begging for forgiveness .
i had to forgive her .
i wasn &apos;t angry at her anymore ,
&apos;cause she had no idea that her husband was doing such a thing .
positive about that ?
oh , yeah .
she was devastated when she found out .
she felt like their whole life together had been a lie .
then , two months ago , i dropped by unexpectedly ,
and i found her unconscious on the sofa .
she &apos;d @-@ she &apos;d taken a handful of prescription sleeping pills .
i put her in a cold shower ,
she came around , and i told her ,
you need to be strong for your sons .
think about them .
and she promised me that she would .
the three of them were so close .
and that &apos;s the thing .
the horrible way that she died .
the violence .
there &apos;s no way
that those boys could have done that to her .
no way .
all right , that woman is a hot mess .
think so ?
but she makes a good point .
maybe the kids hated their dad ,
but why would they kill their mom , too ?
i don &apos;t know .
look , with the government taking everything ,
there &apos;s zero inheritance , right ?
so the money as a motive is completely out .
jerry , what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up is it looks like
your spidey @-@ sense was right again .
your aunt &apos;s fianc leonard cassano ,
is not a retired shop teacher from queens , new york .
his full name is bruce leonard cassano .
he &apos;s a mob lawyer .
son of a bitch .
cassano represented the leone family in new york .
and he really came through for his clients .
gino leone beat three murder raps in ten years .
all right , but everybody &apos;s entitled to a defense , right ?
even a creep like leone .
why would leonard lie to my aunt deb about who he is ?
yeah , that &apos;s probably &apos; cause of the evidence tampering .
nothing was proven ,
but the fbi claims to have wiretaps of the leone brothers
discussing a weapon that gino used
to murder andre ochoa in 2010 .
gino said cassano got rid of it for him .
thank you very much .
so i just hung up the phone with kealoha &apos;s insurance company .
even though david was about to lose everything ,
he was still paying the monthly premium
on a $ 10 million life insurance policy .
the beneficiaries on that policy are jake and travis .
okay , wait a minute .
isn &apos;t the government just gonna take that cash
like they &apos;re going to take everything else ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;d think ,
but it actually goes into a protected trust
that the government can &apos;t touch .
and six weeks ago ,
they upgraded their policy
to include double indemnity clause ,
which pays out twice the cash
in the case of david &apos;s accidental death .
that includes death by murder .
well , nothing says murder like a shotgun blast to the dome , right ?
all right , so that policy &apos;s now worth $ 20 million ?
yep .
there &apos;s our motive .
it keeps pointing back to the kids .
okay , i promise you ,
we get those kids alone ,
put a scare into one of &apos; em ,
he will rat , they will crack .
i guarantee you .
yeah , but that lawyer ,
he &apos;s never gonna let us get those kids alone .
i &apos;d like to talk to the dog .
you should &apos;ve seen . the dog went after these kids .
it was like a canine lie detector .
i don &apos;t understand .
you want us to take a polygraph ?
absolutely not .
hang on a second .
we didn &apos;t know anything about that insurance policy .
and as executor of the estate ,
i can vouch for that .
that &apos;s nice . thank you .
uh , nothing . your parents never mentioned anything ?
no .
they never talked about that stuff with us .
pass the polygraph , we &apos;ll believe you .
this is ridiculous .
as your attorney , i strongly advise you not to participate .
i advise you to shut up .
zip it . let these kids think .
okay ? guys ?
look , somewhere out there is the guy that killed our parents ,
but you &apos;re not even looking for him .
we &apos;re following the evidence , jake .
and you want evidence that we didn &apos;t do it .
so fine .
we &apos;ll take the test .
all right . travis ?
yeah .
okay .
okay . we &apos;ll set it up .
so ?
all right . i mean , jake &apos;s confident .
did you see the look on travis &apos;s face ?
the kid &apos;s scared to death he &apos;s gonna fail .
maybe the older brother acted alone , okay ?
but pass or fail , i hate polygraphs .
they &apos;re inadmissible in court .
we need something more solid .
travis doesn &apos;t want to take the test .
let &apos;s see how far he &apos;ll go to get out of it .
by the way , i need to take an hour
while you wire up jake . is that all right ?
i got to go , uh , talk to my aunt deb .
okay . you sure you want to do that ?
yeah , she deserves the truth .
she deserves to be happy , too . just my opinion .
but you do ... good luck . good luck .
your lawyer said we can use this room .
you need anything while you wait ?
uh , no .
no , i &apos;m okay .
okay .
it &apos;s me .
we have a problem .
just relax , mr. kealoha .
okay .
did you take tai gable &apos;s car out last night ?
no .
is your name jake kealoha ?
yes .
did you kill your parents ?
no .
my favorite auntie .
oh . oh , honey , thank you so much ,
but i &apos;ve had lunch already . i can &apos;t .
you have to have a little room for my delicious shrimp casserole .
since you were so rudely denied the opportunity at thanksgiving .
i &apos;m pretty sure she said she &apos;s full .
but you know what , i &apos;ll take it .
i got some of those shrimp bucks left over from the poker game .
they &apos;re good from ... 2 to 4 every day , right ?
no , no , no , no . those expired , sorry .
bye , auntie .
shrimp casserole , half price .
come and get it !
is everything okay ?
you sounded pretty serious on the phone .
well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to worry you , deb ,
but it is serious .
it &apos;s about leonard .
he &apos;s lying to you .
he @-@ he &apos;s not , he &apos;s not a shop teacher from queens .
i know , i know .
i know exactly who he is .
and leonard isn &apos;t lying to me .
i &apos;ve been lying to you .
what ?
i was afraid you wouldn &apos;t approve
if you knew who he really was .
deb , he &apos;s involved with some very bad people .
you know , there &apos;s allegations that he helped destroy evidence .
leonard says he didn &apos;t .
well , i mean ...
and as for the rest of it ,
his clients , all of that ,
it &apos;s long over .
look .
honey ...
i know you &apos;re worried about me ,
but i can take care of myself .
and i know from disappointment .
i thought i was gonna have a singing career .
it never happened .
and then i thought maybe ...
someday i might get married
and have babies .
but it was never the right time .
but you know , it &apos;s okay .
i have no regrets .
but , steve , the one thing i never gave up on ...
was love .
and i guess it never gave up on me either because here he is .
at long last .
and now , you know ,
i can leave this earth ,
knowing that i have experienced the most profound
and life @-@ altering thing a person can .
i just hope that someday
you &apos;ll know how wonderful that feels .
steve , you &apos;re so willing to risk your life .
when are you gonna be willing to risk your heart ?
i did .
then where &apos;s catherine ?
she &apos;s in afghanistan , deb .
why ?
we went over there together ,
looking for a little boy she knew
from her time in the country ; his name is najib .
he &apos;d been kidnapped by the taliban .
catherine found him .
he &apos;s okay , but ...
she &apos;s worried that the taliban will come back ,
so she decided to stay a while .
try to protect these kids in the village .
she &apos;s teaching at a little school .
uh ... she &apos;s making a life .
so she &apos;s not coming back ?
she said to me i shouldn &apos;t wait for her ,
that she &apos;s found her place .
honey , i &apos;m so sorry .
listen , we were supposed to be talking about you .
me ?
hey , i &apos;m fine .
i just need one thing .
what &apos;s that ?
someone to walk me down the aisle .
you know anybody ?
i do know someone .
jake is telling the truth
when he says he didn &apos;t kill his parents .
okay .
does he know anything about the murder at all ?
not according to the machine .
i hope this means jake is
no longer a person of interest , detective .
let me put a wire on travis , then make my decision . come on .
travis ?
travis ?
does this go down to the parking lot ?
yeah .
this action is in no way an admission of guilt
on the part of my client .
you &apos;re the reason i hate lawyers .
chin , you got him ?
we got him .
you guys were right about this kid .
travis slipped out a couple of minutes ago
and jumped into a cab .
all right , let me know where he lands .
okay , he just pulled into the aloha motel on beach walk .
listen ,
i know you &apos;re scared , but i can &apos;t cover for you anymore .
what are we gonna do ?
hands ! hands !
get &apos; em up !
turn around , get on your knees .
put your hands behind your head ,
interlock your fingers , right now .
running out on us like that , travis .
that wasn &apos;t nice .
look who we found .
come here .
all right , so here &apos;s what we think happened , travis .
you &apos;re young , you &apos;re impressionable .
you &apos;ve been going through a rough time .
patti &apos;s an older woman .
she &apos;s a divorcee .
she &apos;s looking for someone to take care of her ,
someone with money .
only , you don &apos;t have any .
not while your parents are alive , right ?
so let me ask you .
did you come up with the plan to kill them , or did she ?
that &apos;s not what happened .
then why did you run ?
you hiding something ?
it was patti and me who took tai &apos;s car last night .
we lied to you .
we just wanted to be alone .
we needed to talk .
in a motel ?
about what ?
he wanted to tell his parents about us ,
but i said that we couldn &apos;t .
not now .
maybe not ever .
why not ?
patti &apos;s ex wants full custody of their daughter .
if he found out that
patti was sleeping with their son &apos;s best friend ,
he would use it in court .
no one could know .
you knew you &apos;d fail the polygraph , so you ran .
i love patti .
i wanted to protect her .
but i wish i &apos;d gone back to the house last night
and told my parents everything .
i wish ...
we &apos;d had the biggest blowout fight of all time .
because if there were people in the house ,
if there was yelling ,
then maybe the guy who killed them wouldn &apos;t have ever come in .
maybe my folks would still be alive .
kid seems genuinely broken up .
yeah , and you got to admit ,
mrs. robinson does have a valid reason why
she and her boy toy would lie to us .
trouble is , they still don &apos;t have an alibi .
yeah , which means we can &apos;t rule them out just yet .
i think we can all agree
that we like them less and less for the two murders .
all right , so where do we go from here ?
you know , there is someone we haven &apos;t considered .
goodman ?
what makes you think he &apos;s involved ?
he &apos;s the executor of the kealoha estate .
which means he had a strong financial motive
for killing them .
how do you figure ?
fees .
that estate is worth $ 20 million now .
and as executor ,
goodman &apos;s entitled to a piece of that .
that &apos;s right .
think about it .
put yourself in his shoes .
the kealohas used to pay goodman a big retainer .
now , if they go to prison , that money is gone .
but if they go to the morgue ...
money just keeps rolling in .
we need to start getting into this man &apos;s life .
all right ?
yeah .
thanks for coming .
yeah , what can i do for you ?
as soon as deb told me
what her nephew did for a living ,
i figured we &apos;d have some issues .
i got no issue with you being a lawyer , leonard .
you just don &apos;t like my client .
i worked for gino leone , yeah ,
but i felt like my real job
was to keep the government accountable .
there were times they overreached
trying to put gino behind bars .
yeah , because they knew he was guilty .
but if gino leone doesn &apos;t have
the same right to privacy
and self @-@ incrimination as the rest of us ,
sooner or later , none of us will have those rights .
so i gave him my best defense .
apparently , you gave him
a little more than your best defense .
the word is that you helped him bury evidence .
i checked you out .
i knew you would .
that &apos;s why i brought this .
one morning , an envelope was dropped at my office .
inside was a key
to a locker in the penn station
and a note that read ,
&quot; destroy anything you find . &quot;
this box was in the locker .
what &apos;s in it ?
i don &apos;t know .
if i had opened this box ,
and there was evidence ,
morally i would have been compelled
to share it with the prosecution .
so i didn &apos;t open it .
but i didn &apos;t destroy it either .
i would never do that .
what do you want me to do with it ?
do whatever you think is right .
i ended my treatment the day before
deb and i got on the boat .
there &apos;s nothing more they can do .
i &apos;m feeling pretty good right now , but ...
in a month or so , i &apos;m going to take a turn for the worse .
all i really want to do is spend whatever time i have left
making your aunt the happiest woman in the world .
we &apos;re getting married tomorrow ,
but i know it wouldn &apos;t feel right to her
unless you were there .
appreciate you hearing me out .
i really want to know what &apos;s in the box .
if it &apos;s a murder weapon ,
i @-@ i got to give it to the new york d.a. right away .
i mean , they &apos;re gonna figure out where i got it .
it &apos;s definitely gonna cut deb and leonard &apos;s honeymoon
a bit short .
right , now that ... that is trouble
i did not go looking for .
that trouble was dropped at my door .
no , technic ... no , not technically .
specifically , this trouble exists only
because you went looking for trouble
by thinking leonard was a bad guy and looking into him .
quiet as kept .
ladies , if you don &apos;t mind .
so , goodman &apos;s alibi checks out .
okay . so maybe he didn &apos;t pull the trigger .
he could &apos;ve hired someone .
i thought about that , too .
but we looked through his financials ;
there &apos;s nothing here that indicates a payout to a hit man .
check you out .
you &apos;re getting , uh ...
the moves , right ? yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s old @-@ school , baby .
you looking at the lincoln avenue air hockey champ .
is that right ?
that &apos;s right .
look @-@ look at this , now .
you look at the paperwork ,
you don &apos;t see any large withdrawals ,
there &apos;s no curious wire transfers .
all right , hold on .
this guy &apos;s a lawyer , he &apos;s smart , right ?
he &apos;s gonna cover his tracks .
he &apos;s not gonna take the money out of his own account .
all right , then . from where ?
how about from the kealohas themselves ?
turns out that goodman &apos;s firm had access to an old bank account
in kate kealoha &apos;s maiden name .
it was before it was seized by the sec .
now , when the investigation started ,
the kealohas gave goodman
power of attorney over all of their accounts ,
which of course gave him the ability to authorize withdrawals .
they must &apos;ve really trusted him .
mm @-@ hmm . maybe a little too much ,
because when i looked through the recent transactions ,
i found a wire transfer in the amount of $ 100,000
to an off @-@ shore account
to this guy . greg barber .
he &apos;s an old client of goodman &apos;s
with ties to organized crime .
fits the profile of a gun for hire .
so goodman used his own
clients &apos; money to hire a hit man ?
take cover !
cover me .
seriously ?
hey , we &apos;re about to run out of ammo .
then what ?
i prefer the glass half @-@ full scenario where one of my shots hits him .
good luck with that .
you &apos;ll get used to it .
barber . don &apos;t do it .
all clear .
hpd checked barber &apos;s car .
we got no shotgun and no hollow core slugs-- nothing .
all right , we &apos;re striking out in here , too .
but i &apos;m thinking he wouldn &apos;t have been stupid enough
to leave the murder weapon here .
all right , look , we have got to tie barber directly
to this murder or our 100k theory is out the window .
hey , guys , i found this on his laptop .
all right , they &apos;re photos of the kealoha house .
that &apos;s right .
so he did some recon beforehand-- so what ?
yes , but he didn &apos;t take these pictures .
they were e @-@ mailed to him .
must &apos;ve been from eugene goodman .
no , not goodman .
these were taken by kate kealoha .
our victim .
you &apos;re telling us
our mother hired someone to kill her and our father ?
i don &apos;t understand . why would she do that ?
we think it &apos;s because she wanted you and jake to inherit
the $ 20 million in insurance money .
give you guys a fresh start .
fresh start ? i ...
travis ...
i know this is hard to accept ,
but it &apos;s what happened .
your mother had access to the account
that barber was paid from .
she e @-@ mailed barber photographs of your house
so he &apos;d know how to get in .
we took a blood sample from your dog and we found
traces of your mother &apos;s sleeping pill medication
in your dog &apos;s blood .
she drugged riley so he &apos;d sleep through the murders .
i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s why he was so freaked out this morning .
how could she think that we would want the money
more than having them here ?
they always cared too much about the money .
they didn &apos;t know how to see what was important anymore .
boys , there &apos;s something else
you , uh , you should know .
even though your mother was so careful
with the planning of all this ,
this insurance company may still
refuse to pay out on the policy .
it &apos;s blood money .
we would just give it away to the people our father cheated .
the boys are upset ,
but the fact is david kealoha knew nothing
of his wife &apos;s intent to murder him .
the direct beneficiaries , his sons ,
not only did not know about the murder ,
they didn &apos;t even know there was a policy in effect .
there &apos;s no conspiracy here .
the insurance company will lose this battle .
well , i @-@ i don &apos;t think your
battle &apos;s gonna be with the insurance company .
i think it &apos;s gonna be with these two boys .
i think he &apos;s right .
these boys have got too much honor
to take something that &apos;s not rightfully theirs .
travis , i misjudged you .
i &apos;m really sorry about that .
and we &apos;re both deeply sorry
for your loss , both of you .
so ...
what are you gonna do with that thing ?
you know what ?
i think i &apos;m gonna put it in a locker
for a couple of months and ...
accidentally forget about it
and then i &apos;m gonna give it to the new york d.a.
ah . that &apos;s very nice , i think .
you know , leonard never has to deal with it .
you know what , man , you were right .
my aunt deserves to be happy .
she does .
come on , now , we gonna do this thing or what ?
i got on my monkey suit , man , i &apos;m ready to party , baby .
i &apos;m going , you see , i &apos;m putting on my shoes . let &apos;s go .
here &apos;s the thing--
no , i &apos;m never gonna know what &apos;s in leonard cassano &apos;s heart .
but he loves my aunt and my aunt loves him , all right ?
that &apos;s got to be good enough for me .
yes , we &apos;re gonna do this .
all right ? you look great .
you know what you are ?
you &apos;re like a big marshmallow filled with testosterone .
you &apos;d have done the exact same thing .
i would have done the same thing
that is because i am known for my warmth .
oh , yeah , really ? what am i known for ?
you ? you &apos;re known for , uh , you know ,
bad driving and being cheap .
you know what ? uh , uh ...
bad driving ...
better not be all this
fighting all the way to the thing , man ,
&apos;cause i can &apos;t handle it .
don &apos;t make me give you two a time out .
everybody , please rise .
this is your last chance to make a run for it .
no way .
please be seated so we can start the show .
he &apos;s got the authority to do this ?
you can get anything on the internet . ah .
ladies and gentlemen ,
we &apos;re gathered here today
to witness the marriage of deb and leonard .
a couple of months ago they were just strangers in the night ,
but now they know their love is here to stay .
and they &apos;re gonna be together
come rain or come shine ,
because for deb and ...
your boy sinatra
needs some new material .
yeah , tell me about it .
the best is yet to come .
who here presents this lovely bride
to be married to this man ?
i do .
thank you .
before we start with the vow @-@ taking ,
the bride and groom would like
to say a few words to each other .
leonard ?
my beautiful deb .
i can &apos;t believe that a diagnosis
of stage iv cancer could make me the happiest man in the world ,
but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s true .
you held my hand through chemo ,
but you were my real treatment .
i can &apos;t even remember my life
before you came along and changed
everything .
you are my angel ,
my one in a million ...
and all i want is to be your husband .
to cherish every moment we have together .
i love you .
i love you .
i don &apos;t have a way with words the way
my darling leonard has ,
so , uh ,
i &apos;ve chosen to rely
on the gershwin brothers .
* &apos; s wonderful *
* &apos; s marvelous *
* you should care *
* for me *
* &apos; s awful nice *
* &apos; s paradise *
* &apos; s what i love *
* to see *

* my life so glamorous *
* you can &apos;t blame me for feeling *
* amorous *
* oh , &apos; s wonderful *
* &apos; s marvelous *
* that you should care *
* for me . *
