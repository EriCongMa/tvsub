is it okay if i bring someone to your parents &apos; anniversary ?
sure .
yeah .
who &apos;s the guy ?
parker , we met at the cleaners .
did he put a little starch in your bloomers ?
who said that ?
no , he &apos;s really great , though . he has this incredible zest for life .
he treats me like a queen . except when he treats me like a naughty girl .
would it be okay if i give the toast ?
even after what happened at their 20th ?
i &apos;d really like to .
hopefully this time mom won &apos;t boo you .
yes ! every year ross makes the toast , and it always makes them cry .
this year , i &apos;m gonna make them cry .
you wonder why ross is their favorite ?
any time ross makes a toast , everyone cries and pats him on the back .
and they all come up to me and say , &quot; god , your brother . &quot;
you know what they &apos;re gonna say this year ? &quot; god , you . &quot;
well , at least one person will be crying .
i &apos;m an actor , and any actor worth his salt can cry on cue .
really ? you can do that ?
oh , you kidding me ? watch .
well , i can &apos;t do it with you guys watching me !
the.one.in.massapequa

oh , my god . you look so fantastic .
on my way over , i pictured you in my mind &apos;s eye .
now i &apos;m like , &quot; mind &apos;s eye , you had no idea ! &quot;
let &apos;s do that again !
okay .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m working on my toast .
or as i like to call it : &quot; sob @-@ fest 2002 . &quot;
i cannot wait to see them cry .
it &apos;s not gonna be like regular crying . it &apos;s gonna be like terms of endearment crying .
i &apos;m gonna reduce my parents to sniffling , quaking masses of ..
i may have some unresolved anger from my childhood .
hey , check this out .
it &apos;s a dog .
it &apos;s a dead dog .
chi @-@ chi . she died when i was in high school .
you &apos;re talking about a dead pet ?
it &apos;s good stuff , huh ?
joey ? you got a present for my parents ?
in honor of their 35th anniversary , i had a star named after them .
} -that is so cool .
and i got kama sutra for the elderly .
you know , i think maybe the one present is enough .
do you guys have any extra ribbon ?
sure .
what do you need ? we got lace , satin , sateen , raffia , gingham , felt ..
and i think my testicles may be in here too .
chi @-@ chi ! oh , i loved this dog .
monica couldn &apos;t get braces because chi @-@ chi needed knee surgery .
what ?
you &apos;re the 200 @-@ pounder who rode her !
hey ! everybody , this is parker . parker , this is ..
no , don &apos;t tell me . let me guess : joey , monica , ross , rachel ..
and i &apos;m sorry , phoebe didn &apos;t mention you .
chandler , i &apos;m kidding ! already you &apos;re my favorite .
tell me a little about yourselves .
actually , we should get going .
classic ross !
rachel , look how you glow ! may i ?
i think you already are .
rachel , you have life growing inside you .
is there anything more miraculous .. a picture of a dog ! whose is this ?
that &apos;s my old dog . he passed away years ago .
well , at least you were lucky to have him . bow @-@ wow , old friend . bow @-@ wow .
you guys , we really should get going .
there i go again , my catch phrase .
so where &apos;s the party ?
it &apos;s in massapequa .
massapequa , it sounds magical . is it steeped in native american history ?
well , there is an arby &apos;s in the shape of a tepee .
i &apos;ve got my notes . you got the presents ?
i &apos;ve got the car keys .
we &apos;re driving ? aces .
so he seems like a nice guy .
yeah , i like him a lot .
you want to hang back and take a cab ?
okay , otherwise i &apos;m not going .
hey , mom .
this is such a great party !
thirty @-@ five years . impressive . do you have any pearls of wisdom ?
jack ?
why serve food on such a sharp stick ?
it &apos;s a good question , dad . it &apos;s a good question .
congratulations , you two .
thank you , we &apos;re so excited .
and also , congratulations on your wedding .
can we talk to you for just a moment ?
yeah .
it &apos;s just a little thing .
while we think it &apos;s marvelous you &apos;re having this baby out of wedlock ..
our friends are less open @-@ minded .
we told them you &apos;re married .
what ?
thanks for going along with this .
we have to pretend that we &apos;re married ?
i had to shave my ears .
you can do this .
can you believe that ?
i know .
if you do the ears , you may as well take a pass at the nose .
i don &apos;t want to have to lie about being married .
i don &apos;t either . but it &apos;s their party , and it &apos;s one night .
we don &apos;t have to lie . we won &apos;t talk .
if it comes up , we &apos;ll smile , we &apos;ll nod along ..
ross ?
rachel ?
hi , aunt lisa . uncle dan .
congratulations on the baby and on the wedding .
here &apos;s something to start you out .
how &apos;s marriage treating you ?
unbelievable . it &apos;s great !
we love marriage .
we &apos;ll see you later .
hey !
hi !
can i just say , monica , that your driving is exquisite .
thanks . like i said before , i pretty much just stayed in the lines ..
and tried not to hit anybody .
what a beautiful place . what a great night .
i have to tell you , being here with all of you in event room c ..
i feel so lucky . think of the good times that happened here .
the birthdays , the proms , the mitzvahs , both bar and bat !
none will compare with tonight . i don &apos;t want to forget it .
it &apos;s like i want to take a mental picture of you all . click .
i don &apos;t think the flash went off .
i &apos;m gonna find the men &apos;s room .
i &apos;ll go with you .
somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun ..
and a huge butterfly net looking for that man .
i have to go too , but i don &apos;t want him complimenting my thing .
glad we weren &apos;t in the car . did he let up ?
he called the long lsland expressway a &quot; concrete miracle . &quot;
this room . this night .
that waiter ! his shoes ! i must take a mental picture !
sorry .
were you guys making fun of parker ?
that depends , how much did you hear ?
he &apos;s a little enthusiastic . what &apos;s wrong with that ?
it &apos;s so much .
well , so what ? i like him .
do i make fun of the people you date ? tag , janice , mona .
no , because friends don &apos;t do that . do you want my opinion ?
your collective dating record reads like a who &apos;s who of human crap !
i feel terrible .
i know .
what was wrong with mona ?
open it , open it , open it .
yeah , baby !
so we never got to hear about your wedding .
we were surprised we weren &apos;t invited .
no , it was a small wedding .
but it was beautiful . it was small , but kind of spectacular .
where did you have it ?
on a cliff in barbados , at sunset .
and stevie wonder sang &quot; lsn &apos;t she lovely &quot; as i walked down the aisle .
stevie &apos;s a family friend .
oh , my god . that &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;d love to see pictures .
yeah , so would i.
you wouldn &apos;t think annie liebowitz would forget to put film in the camera .
would you excuse us for a second ?
what are you doing ?
what ? this may be my only wedding .
and i want it to be amazing .
okay .
maybe i rode in on a harley .
ross , it has to be realistic .
say , are you okay ? you seem kind of quiet .
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m great . i &apos;m with you .
and i &apos;m with you . what a great time !
look at this plate bouncy thing .
what an inspired solution to man &apos;s plate @-@ dispensing problems .
oysters ! let me feed you .
that &apos;s not necessary .
please ?
i don &apos;t eat ..
i won &apos;t quit until you try one .
okay , fine .
good .
what &apos;re they like ? i &apos;ve never had one .
try one .
they look too weird .
i know , i know .
listen , your family is really starting to warm up to me .
you just kissed the caterer .
what are you doing ?
going over my toast .
those two will never know what hit &apos;em
i can &apos;t wait . they &apos;ll cry so hard , they &apos;ll be fighting for breath .
if you want to , i could just hold them down and you could just ..
and my veil was lace , made by blind belgian nuns .
blind ?
not at first , but it &apos;s intricate work .
they said even though they lost their sight , it was worth it .
i bet you looked beautiful .
well , i don &apos;t know .
but there were some people that said i looked like a floating angel .
how did you propose ?
oh , yeah , that &apos;s a great story .
well , actually , i took her to the planetarium .
that &apos;s where we had our first date .
i had the room filled with lilies , her favorite flower .
that is so sweet !
i want to hear the rest !
then fred astaire singing , &quot; the way you look tonight &quot; came on ..
the lights came down , i got on one knee ..
and written across the dome , in the stars , were the words :
&quot; will you marry me ? &quot;
and the ring was the size of my fist .
hey , phoebe ? look ..
i want to apologize . okay ? we were being jerks .
parker &apos;s nice , i &apos;d like to know him .
you better do it now .
why ?
because i &apos;m gonna kill him .
what ?
he &apos;s too excited about everything .
i &apos;m all for living , but this is the gellers &apos; 35th anniversary .
let &apos;s call a spade a spade . this party stinks .
i &apos;m having the worst time .
there was a line for the buffet , and when i got to the plates ..
i slipped on a giant booger .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t an oyster ?
it could &apos;ve been . i didn &apos;t look at it .
i wiped it on chandler &apos;s coat and got the hell out .
i thought he was a great guy . i was so excited about him .
well , hey , you should be excited about him .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with him .
you think ?
yeah , know what ?
we were all just being too negative .
you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s just embracing life . we could all stand to be more like parker .
you know what ? i &apos;m like him ! i &apos;m a positive person !
actually , you have an edge .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s parker !
look , the bunny hop !
oh , i love it !
you do ?
are you kidding ? people acting like animals to music ? come on !
okay , it &apos;s time for the toast .
i know normally ross gives the toast , but this year i &apos;ll do it .
no , it &apos;s gonna be great . really .
okay .
mom , dad , when i got married ..
the thing that made me sure i could do it was the example you two set .
for that , and other things , i want to thank you .
i know i probably don &apos;t say it enough ..
but i love you .
when i look around , i &apos;m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here .
nana , my beloved grandmother , who would so want to be here .
but she can &apos;t ..
because she &apos;s dead .
as is our dog , chi @-@ chi .
i mean , look how cute she is .. was .
do me a favor , pass this to my parents .
remember she &apos;s dead , okay ? her and nana , gone .
wow !
does anybody remember when ..
debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment ?
didn &apos;t see that ?
no movie fans ? !
you want to hear something sad ?
i was watching a 60 minutes piece on orphans in romania ..
who have been so neglected that they were incapable of love .
you people are made of stone !
here &apos;s to mom and dad . whatever !
thank you , monica . that was interesting .
wasn &apos;t it interesting , jack ?
why don &apos;t i remember this dog ?
ross ? why don &apos;t you give us your toast now ?
oh , no , mom . it &apos;s just monica this year .
you &apos;re not saying anything ? on our 35th wedding anniversary ?
no , of course .
everybody ? i just wanted to say ..
on behalf of my new bride , rachel ..
and myself , that if ..
if in 35 years , we &apos;re half as happy as you guys are ..
we &apos;ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .
oh , ross .
i just wish nana were alive to hear ross &apos; toast .
my god , what a fantastically well @-@ lit hallway .
can i get you something to drink , like a water and valium ?
i must say , this apartment , it &apos;s .. there are no words .
thank god .
it &apos;s a haven .
a third @-@ floor paradise , a modern eden .
yeah , i know , i know . gotcha .
listen , why don &apos;t we just sit and relax , just be with each other quietly .
that sounds great .
this is the most comfortable couch i &apos;ve ever sat on .
let &apos;s try something . let &apos;s play a game .
i love games .
shocking .
let &apos;s play the game of ..
who can stay quiet the longest .
or jenga .
let &apos;s play this one first , and remember , whoever talks first loses .
i lose , now jenga .
oh , my god .
is something wrong ?
you know the word &quot; wrong &quot; ?
everything isn &apos;t perfect or magical ?
everything isn &apos;t aglow with the light of fairies ?
they were just brake lights , parker !
excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam .
you don &apos;t have to put a good spin on everything !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a positive person .
no , i &apos;m a positive person .
you are like santa claus on prozac .
at disneyland , getting laid !
you want me to be negative ? you want me to be less happy ?
much less happy .
fine . well , then to quote ross , &quot; i better be going . &quot;
so long !
don &apos;t let the &quot; best door in the world &quot; hit you in the ass on your way out .
isn &apos;t this the most incredible fight you &apos;ve had in your life ?
we could &apos;ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar .
it just isn &apos;t feasible .
but a dove placing the ring on your finger would &apos;ve been no problem .
it was fun being married to you .
yeah , and it was an easy 400 bucks .
okay , ross , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
that proposal at the planetarium ?
i know , i know . it was stupid .
are you kidding ? with the lilies , and the song and the stars ?
it was really wonderful . did you just make that up ?
i thought of it when we were going out .
that &apos;s how i imagined i would ask you to marry me .
wow .
well , that would &apos;ve been very hard to say no to .
it &apos;s a good thing i didn &apos;t do it , it sounds like a very expensive wedding .
okay , good night .
good night .
even if the sidecar had a windscreen to protect your hair ?
i will think about it .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
okay , that &apos;s it . i give up .
at mom and dad &apos;s 40th anniversary , you give the speech .
you know , i don &apos;t understand why they didn &apos;t cry .
come on .
that stuff you said about true love ?
you were right . we did learn a lot from mom and dad .
that picture of chi @-@ chi with her mischievous grin .
and what you said about nana ? yeah , she really would &apos;ve wanted to be there .
and you know what ?
i think she was .
