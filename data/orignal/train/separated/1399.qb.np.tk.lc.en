riley morton coming up now .
kelly at second . started the inning with a double .
that seems like an hour ago .
honey , i thought you were gonna take out the garbage .
i am .
high fly to right . hooking , hooking- foul .
phil .
yes . getting it .
i was- i was gonna get it .
dylan .
hey , mrs. dunphy .
um , i &apos;m just waiting for haley .
did you ring the bell ?
i texted .
she said she &apos;d be down in just a minute .
oh , great . tell her i said &quot; hi . &quot;
i will .
dylan ! d @-@ money !
chillin &apos; with dylan the villain !
&quot; d &quot; to the &quot; y &quot; to the-
hey , mr. dunphy .
hey ! come on in .
you &apos;re just in time to catch the end of the game .
oh , i &apos;m not really a baseball guy .
haley says &quot; hi . &quot;
i was just being facetious .
come on . i &apos;ll catch you up .
sit it . park it .
come on . i don &apos;t bite .
kidding .
i &apos;m kidding .
okay . see that guy ? he &apos;s the tying run .
interesting story about him .
he &apos;s been stuck on second base forever ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s gonna try and steal third ,
which is just a terrible , terrible idea .
how are you and haley doing ?
i wish i could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes .
these aren &apos;t toy airplanes , manny .
these are models , and they &apos;re very complicated .
you wanna fly one of these , you gotta be familiar with airfoil ,
drag , lift and thrust-
and these are all principles of aerodynamics .
the box says &quot; 12 and up . &quot;
what ?
you can fly toy planes with jay next time .
today you have to spend time with luke .
why ?
because his mother invited you , so you go .
family needs to be close . right , jay ?
i &apos;m pretty sure this is a typo .
men need their hobbies . manny &apos;s father had many hobbies .
like hiking in the desert ,
that kind of skiing that they drop you from the-
how do you say in english ?
helicopter .
yes .
once , on a dare , he even boxed with an alligator .
&quot; wrestle . &quot; you wrestle-
you can &apos;t box with alligators .
are you sure ?
how would they get the gloves on those little claws ?
aren &apos;t they like tiny little hands ?
no !
okay , now i forgot what we &apos;re talking about .
anyways , hobbies are important for the men ,
whether you &apos;re risking your life ...
or flying little planes from a safe distance .
wait , wait , wait . what are you doing ?
uh , we &apos;re just gonna buy some diapers . it &apos;ll just take a second .
this is costco .
yeah , which is where we buy diapers .
since when ?
do you remember when we adopted that baby a few months back ?
since then .
mitchell is a snob .
no . n @-@ no , i @-@ i &apos;m discerning .
official slogan for snobs .
when we first met , he wouldn &apos;t even look at me ...
because i was a hick from the farm in missouri ,
and he &apos;s a big city mouse .
who says &quot; city mouse &quot; ?
country mice .
i think i &apos;m gonna go wait in the car .
okay .
hey , if you &apos;re on your way out , can you grab the garbage ?
i got it .
okay . we got it .
he &apos;s a little jumpy .
oh , go figure-
a teenage boy doesn &apos;t want to hang out with his girlfriend &apos;s dad .
thought we were past all that .
i &apos;m all about-
i &apos;m all about taking it to the next level .
really ?
thought you were all about keeping it real .
yes .
but the whole point of keeping it real is
so you can take it to the next level .
did you really not know that ?
you haven &apos;t exactly taken it to the next level with my dad .
what are you talking about ?
we &apos;ve been married for 16 years ,
and you still walk on eggshells around him .
what ? are you kidding ?
jay and i are total buds .
you @-@ you want to just hang out ?
brought six friends , so that just-
that &apos;s-
第一季第三集
manny brought his favorite game to play with luke .
it &apos;s called empire .
you use strategy to expand territories and take over the world .
luke is gonna love that . he &apos;s out back playing .
do you need me to get you something while i &apos;m out shopping ?
that &apos;s such a nice offer , but i think we &apos;re good . thanks .
okay . what about this ?
you don &apos;t even say &quot; hello &quot; to gloria and manny ?
hi , gloria and manny . okay , mom , what about this ?
no . you &apos;re wearing a dress .
mom , come on .
what ? it &apos;s gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon ?
but it &apos;s a wedding for some friend of yours i never even heard of .
it &apos;s non @-@ negotiable . you can borrow a dress of haley &apos;s again .
no .
that sends an ugly message- that i &apos;m haley .
you know , instead of trying to force me to wear a dress ,
why don &apos;t you worry about getting luke to wear some pants ?
what ? why does he do this ?
luke !
pants ! come on !
jay and i are buds , for sure-
but with kind of , um , an invisible asterisk .
um , he &apos;s not , uh- he &apos;s not a talker .
or @-@ or a hugger .
once he ran over my foot with his car .
to @-@ to be fair , he had just given up smoking ,
but basically we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re buds .
do you have to just stand there ?
you &apos;re making me feel uneasy .
oh , for god &apos;s sake . sit here . here .
hold this wing like this while i adjust this .
okay .
come on . here .
not too hard .
alex , why don &apos;t you come shopping with me ?
maybe i can help you find something that you like .
that &apos;s a really nice offer , but it &apos;s not really her thing .
actually , i &apos;d love to go .
see , you don &apos;t know what my thing is .
you have no idea what my thing is .
i know what your thing is .
your thing is to provoke , just like your sister &apos;s thing ...
is to never come out of her room ,
and your brother &apos;s thing-
well , there &apos;s your brother &apos;s thing .
luke ! put &apos; em on ! mm @-@ hmm .
the thing about me and jay is our relationship &apos;s ...
always been stuck in that ,
that primal place where it started .
you know , he &apos;s the old silverback protecting his females ,
then along comes this younger , stronger gorilla swinging in ,
beating his chest .
you know , naturally , the ape ladies come running ,
presenting their nice scarlet behinds .
papa ape wants to stop all that , but he can &apos;t .
you know ? that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s life . i &apos;m not the enemy .
the enemy is poachers .
that &apos;ll do it . don &apos;t touch it .
all right .
you wanna go fly it ?
sure .
oh . hey , i got the toothpaste and the soap .
good . now we can open that general store .
i thought we were just here to get diapers .
we had a saying on the farm :
as long as you &apos;re bringing the mule to the market , you-
i feel you rolling your eyes at me .
we met at one of pepper &apos;s legendary game nights .
i remember mitchell because
he kept rolling his eyes every time i would get a little boisterous .
i did not .
a little bit .
yeah , maybe a little bit .
anyway , we were- we were playing charades ,
and i had no idea how to act out my clue .
and all i could think of to do was-
and without missing a beat , cam says-
casablanca .
all i did was this-
casablanca .
casablanca .
can we just please get the diapers and get out of here ?
fine , but i wanna stop by the wine section first .
wait . there &apos;s a wine section ?
yeah , a really good one- just past the tires .
no way . they do not have- oh , my god .
oh , my- cam . cam . the paper shredder i wanted .
huh ? confetti and crosscut .
yep .
oh , my god . amazing .
yeah .
cam , what is this place ?
those cookies smell like heaven . your own recipe ?
no , i just throw &apos; em in the oven .
and added the secret ingredient of caring ?
sure .
so , you and luke having a good time ?
i don &apos;t know . he won &apos;t come out of his box .
maybe i &apos;ll just stay here and spend some time with my sister .
oh , right . i guess technically i would be your stepsister .
my mother says we are never to use the word &quot; step &quot;
because it means &quot; not real . &quot;
and we are a real family . mmm .
so what is the matter , claire ?
what ?
you seem sad .
it &apos;s just stuff with alex .
you know , kid stuff .
kids .
you don &apos;t have to tell me . my school is full of them .
i was thinking after lunch we can go and do a little shopping .
i &apos;m not getting a dress .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m not your mother .
i know . you &apos;re my grandmother .
step @-@ grandmother .
anyways , today , think of me as a girlfriend .
two girls out for an afternoon of fun .
what do you usually do with your girlfriends ?
i don &apos;t know . we go out . we talk , drink wine .
can i drink wine ?
no .
some friend .
well , you can still talk to me about anything .
yeah , adults always say that , but they don &apos;t mean it .
when my mom says i can ask her anything ,
i really can &apos;t .
she just freaks out .
i won &apos;t freak out . shoot .
okay .
how many men have you slept with ?
eight . next .
now can i try it ?
no .
i should get one of those . i &apos;ve always loved planes .
if things had gone a little differently in my life ,
i think i would have been a pilot .
hey , what would happen if you turned the remote off
and then back on real fast ?
yeah , you &apos;d have been a great pilot .
so , can you do a- can you do a loop @-@ de @-@ loop ?
if i wanted to .
no way ! can i try it ?
no .
i can see why you like this . it &apos;s so peaceful .
it &apos;s like the whole world just ... disappears out here .
i remember this one summer-
i &apos;ll tell you what .
there &apos;s another trick called &quot; threading the needle . &quot;
i used to do it with claire and mitch when they were kids .
you wanna try it ?
how &apos;s it go ?
you grab one of those hoops over there ...
and go to the far , far , far end of the field ...
and stand there , and i fly the plane through it .
um , that sounds awesome !
and then i get a chance flying it ?
no .
okay .
how &apos;s this ?
not far enough . go on .
okay . further down .
you can &apos;t go too far .
right . okay , i get it . i get it .
how &apos;s this ?
good .
now stand still . don &apos;t move .
okay , let &apos;s do it . whoo !
whoo ! i love it !
i love ... it !
you drove a plane into my face .
you must have moved . i told you to stay still .
i didn &apos;t move .
try not to talk .
i want to make sure nothing &apos;s broken .
alex and i can &apos;t just disagree .
i mean , she has to turn everything into a fight .
hmm . a strong , independent woman .
sounds like somebody else i know .
i was never hostile though .
i mean , this whole thing with the dress-
never had this problem with haley .
maybe alex doesn &apos;t want to compete with her big sister .
maybe she &apos;s trying to create her own identity .
put her in a dress , and she disappears .
for one afternoon ?
i wouldn &apos;t give up being myself for even one second .
sometimes it &apos;s hard to remember you &apos;re only 10 years old .
and three @-@ quarters .
yeah .
hey , it &apos;s mitchell . do you guys eat olives ?
olives ?
really good olives ?
yeah .
you got it .
mitchell , i found the diapers . they &apos;re over here .
cameron , guess what i found ?
coffins .
they sell baby formula and they sell coffins .
you can buy literally buy
everything you need from birth to death .
oh , my god . look at these diapers .
look how cheap they are !
oh . you know what we should do ?
we should get enough for the next year or two , right ?
where would we keep them ?
they sell sheds .
really ?
you want to buy a diaper shed ?
we &apos;re those guys now ? the guys with a diaper shed ?
just grab two more .
i &apos;m not grabbing two more , mitchell .
it &apos;s time to go .
come on , come on . we need , uh- hey , excuse me .
where did you get that flatbed thing ?
over there .
go grab one of those .
really ?
yeah . get two .
i &apos;m in the applesauce aisle .
so , anyways ,
after charades , we went out for coffee .
and i learned that he loves art .
he plays the piano . he speaks french .
un peu .
you see ?
i @-@ i misjudged him .
yeah , i &apos;m sort of like costco .
i &apos;m big , i &apos;m not fancy , and i dare you to not like me .
yeah , and i &apos;m kinda more like that , um-
what is the name of that little shop we went to in paris ?
you are such a snob .
casablanca .
i have a small flower on my ankle ...
and a tiny little butterfly on my ... thigh .
how high up ?
pretty high .
did you do it to look sexy ?
no- - did you do it for a guy ? does grandpa like it ?
no , no and yes .
that &apos;s gross
let &apos;s go back to your piercings .
no , no , no .
i &apos;ve answered enough of your questions .
now it &apos;s your turn to answer one .
what is it ?
why you don &apos;t want to wear a dress ?
because i don &apos;t want to look like haley and her stupid friends .
i wear dresses and i don &apos;t look like haley .
you are haley , just 40 years older .
ten .
twenty .
deal . alex , why are you fighting me on this ?
just- it doesn &apos;t matter if i dress up .
i &apos;m not pretty like haley and you .
that &apos;s ridiculous ! you &apos;re beautiful .
i &apos;m not .
but that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m the smart one .
the cute busboy doesn &apos;t know that you &apos;re smart .
what ?
he &apos;s been smiling at you every time he comes to the table .
he does not !
why do you think we are the only people with bread ?
look . one day you &apos;re going to want to date a cute guy like that .
and when that day comes , you &apos;re going to want to look beautiful ,
and then you &apos;ll wear a dress .
so , you ever kiss another girl ?
that &apos;s no way to talk to your grandmother .
was my mom hard on me growing up ?
yeah , she was .
but you know what ? back then
everything was betty friedan and gloria steinem .
they didn &apos;t understand-
hola ! we &apos;re back .
hello .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
it was great .
did you have fun with luke ?
well , not-
we had a great time .
alex , i &apos;ve been thinking , and ...
if you don &apos;t want to wear a dress to the wedding ,
it &apos;s not the end of the world .
it &apos;s all right . i bought one .
do you see how she has to provoke me ?
we &apos;ll talk about it next week .
claire !
clear the way . coming through . ow !
coming through . easy . easy , fella . ow !
i need to rest my face .
you &apos;re fine .
you &apos;ll be all right . hang on .
oh , my god !
get the door .
ah ! dad ?
little accident . nothing big .
i was in a plane crash .
what happened ?
we were threading the needle , and somebody moved .
no , i didn &apos;t . you did it on purpose .
that &apos;s the painkiller talking .
he &apos;s a little loopy .
how bad is it ?
well , the wing is cracked ,
the propeller &apos;s bent , but i can- i can-
i mean phil .
i was in a plane crash .
thanks , dad .
i didn &apos;t ask him to be there . he insisted .
he took a chance . this is what happened .
kind of like the time you ran over his foot .
you ran over his foot ?
that was an accident .
you know , dad , you did it on purpose .
we all saw the tire marks on the lawn .
i had just quit smoking .
see , you &apos;re upsetting your husband .
water .
i &apos;ll get it .
ay . you okay ?
gloria ! thank god you &apos;re here .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m here too .
who &apos;s this ?
wasn &apos;t my fault .
i have seen you thread the needle a million times .
you never miss .
yeah . i must be getting old .
why don &apos;t you just admit it ? you never liked phil .
put that down . you do not get a cookie .
i like phil .
it &apos;s just that sometimes he tries too hard , you know ?
and it &apos;s just kind of- irritating .
okay , maybe he tries too hard
because you make zero effort with him .
you know what ? in the 16 years that we &apos;ve been married ,
have you one time told him that you liked him ?
not in those exact words , no .
no .
not in any words , dad .
how do you think that makes me feel ?
you &apos;ve never told your son that you love him ?
whoa , whoa . when did we jump to love ?
and he &apos;s technically not my son .
ah . so that means that you don &apos;t love manny either ?
sure , i do .
i mean , believe me , when i was in that park ,
i really wished manny was there .
for what ?
so that you could fly the plane into his head ? huh ?
dad , thanks so much for bringing phil home .
i found one of your little flaps in his hair . so-
actually , this is called an aileron .
it controls ... - because that &apos;s what matters right now .
bye , dad .
hey , phil .
jay .
what are you , made of china ?
phil , i just want you to know i &apos;m sorry .
and whether i , uh , missed or you moved-
i didn &apos;t .
either way .
i just want to say that i like you .
really ?
yeah .
what do you like about me ?
you &apos;re a nice guy .
try real hard .
i do .
and you &apos;re a good dad .
hey , i &apos;m a good dad . come here .
come here , you .
this feels so right .
what &apos;s going on ?
there was a little accident ,
but jay &apos;s telling phil how much he loves him .
oh . well , that &apos;s nice for phil .
that &apos;s great ,
since he &apos;s never said anything like that to my boyfriend .
let it go .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
no , mitch is right . go in there too , cam . come on .
you &apos;re kidding .
jay !
i &apos;m gonna get this .
come on in , cam .
just a little hug .
get in here .
say it .
whoa ! hey , hey , hey !
say it ! say it !
i like you too , cam .
what do you like about him ?
oh , jez .
where did you get that camera ?
only the greatest store on earth .
thanks , dad .
manny , picture ! get in there too .
get in here , mi amigo . oh !
stay still . say &quot; cheese . &quot;
don &apos;t push it .
cheese !
picture .
cheese !
cheese . queso .
oh , boy !
doesn &apos;t it feel like these arms could go around the world ?
i think i strained something .
i always wanted a daughter-
to dress her up in pretty dresses ,
do her hair , her nails , her makeup .
no one knows this , but for the first year of his life ,
i made up manny like a girl
and told everybody that he was my daughter .
ay , but just for a few times .
i didn &apos;t want to mess with his head .
when he found the pictures ,
i told him that it was his twin sister who died .
