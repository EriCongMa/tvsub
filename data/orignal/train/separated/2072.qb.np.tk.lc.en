i put gallo away for racketeering .
but that &apos;s not what he really did .
what are you talking about ?
we had him for conspiracy to commit murder ,
and the police let the tape of that bastard admitting
that he did it out of the chain of custody for 20 minutes .
you had an alibi witness ,
and your public defender let her get away ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying !
i didn &apos;t have an alibi witness .
i had a no @-@ show who vanished into thin air .
well , you could &apos;ve asked for
postponement to have time to find her .
and i would have , except for one thing :
when i pressed her as to what the two of them
were doing at the time of those murders ,
she admitted they were both on meth .
gallo &apos;s filing came back ,
and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record .
you want me to represent that animal ?
kind of funny , isn &apos;t it ?
you fighting to get me out
when you fought so hard to put me away .
it makes me sick to my stomach ,
but you &apos;re gonna give me something in return .
not only are you gonna keep your hands off mike ,
you &apos;re gonna be his personal protector in here .
you kept my wife out of prison .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , that makes us square .
harvey and mike did it ,
which means mike &apos;s coming home .
oh , my god .
joshua called .
he &apos;s coming to town tomorrow .
are you gonna break up with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really appreciate you doing this .
and ... if you weren &apos;t with me ,
i can &apos;t imagine how i &apos;d handle
whether or not tara is breaking up with joshua .
joshua--what is he ?
lord of the kingdom of dicken @-@ stein ,
reigning over his subjects from high atop douche mountain ?
anyway , thanks for being here .
aside from tara ,
you &apos;re the most important woman in my entire life .
oh , my god , louis .
mudding is ...
amazing .
i actually just fell asleep for the last half hour .
goddamn it , donna .
i didn &apos;t bring you here so you could fall asleep
while i &apos;m pouring my heart out .
you &apos;re the most selfish woman i ever met .
i thought you just told me i was the most important
non @-@ tara woman in your life .
wait a second . i thought you just fell asleep .
and for the last thirty seconds ,
have you been mad at me or upset about joshua ?
holy shit , you &apos;re a genius .
which is why when we get back to the office ,
you &apos;re reconciling everyone &apos;s billings
for the last six weeks .
oh , donna , that is the worst form of torture
i can go through .
no , louis , the worst form of torture
is what you &apos;ll do if you don &apos;t have something
to occupy your mind .
oh , my god , you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t care what the cost
or that i &apos;m entirely naked underneath this mud .
i &apos;m getting us another hour .
louis , you are not moving another centimeter
until renaldo comes back in here
and puts that privacy curtain back up .
oh , look who &apos;s here .
i &apos;m not supposed to get out till this afternoon ,
but leave it to you to--
mike , sit down .
okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
cahill called and said
there was a problem with your release .
it &apos;s not a big deal ,
but it &apos;s just gonna take a little longer .
how much longer ?
a few days .
harvey , i informed on someone .
if word gets out about that--
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
but he pulled your deal then reinstated it .
it &apos;s gonna take a little time .
well , what the hell am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
sit tight , and keep your wits about you .
you made it this long .
you can make it a few more days .
does rachel know about this ?
look , she didn &apos;t know it was gonna take this long
in the first place ,
and i didn &apos;t see the need to tell her now .
do me a favor , and let &apos;s keep it that way .
rachel , good morning .
i was looking for you before .
i wanted to say congratulations on getting mike out .
i appreciate that .
but we have some other good news .
we may be on our way to getting leonard bailey out too .
did you figure out a way to reopen the trial ?
i did .
rachel , this is good in theory ,
but there &apos;s no precedent .
yes , there is .
turner versus the state of michigan .
how the hell did you find that ?
it turns out being a paralegal for so long
was a blessing in disguise ,
because nobody is better at research than me .
great . write up a declaration ,
and get it to me as soon as you &apos;re done .
and i &apos;ll get this thing rolling .
jessica , i thought i &apos;d be the one to do it .
rachel , you &apos;re not a lawyer yet .
i don &apos;t need to be .
she &apos;s his public defender . she &apos;ll do this for us .
listen to me--sometimes things don &apos;t go exactly as planned .
and nobody is better at research than you ,
but nobody is better at dropping the hammer than me .
listen to me , i &apos;m gonna ask you a question ,
and i need to know the truth .
you know about this cahill shit ?
what cahill shit ?
apparently sutter wasn &apos;t enough for that asshole ,
because he &apos;s been seizing our assets left and right .
you really think they were gonna let her
keep direct proceeds from insider trading ?
i &apos;m not talking about direct proceeds .
i &apos;m talking about everything we have .
what ?
yeah ,
including money she earned
before she ever got wrapped up in that bullshit .
they can &apos;t do that .
well , they &apos;re doing it .
and i don &apos;t care whether you do something about it
from in here or when you get out there ,
but you &apos;re the one who convinced us to take this deal , mike ,
so you better damn well be the one to stop it .
hey , counselor .
you didn &apos;t forget about me , did you ?
your hearing &apos;s tomorrow at 2 : 00 .
i sent you the paperwork .
right under the wire .
cutting it close , huh ?
i said i &apos;d get it done , and it &apos;s done , gallo .
now i &apos;m leaving .
so soon ?
i thought you might want to meet and chat strategy .
my strategy is for you to get your parole tomorrow
and then burn your existence from my brain .
i don &apos;t think i like the way you just spoke
to your own client , harvey .
you better come through .
i &apos;ll come through , gallo ,
but you better remember your part of the deal .
what , protecting mike ?
what does mike need protecting for if i &apos;m cool with him ?
save your bullshit .
i know you know mike was informing .
yeah , i also know william sutter &apos;s going away ,
which means mike &apos;s getting out .
well , he &apos;s not out yet ,
so while you &apos;re both still in there ,
you don &apos;t take your eyes off him .
i &apos;m nothing if not a man of my word .
oh , and harvey , i don &apos;t want to stand
of the parole board wearing this ,
so bring me something nice to wear .
i was a 38 slim when i came in .
now i &apos;m more like a 40 reg .
i &apos;ll leave it up to you ; you &apos;re the dandy .
this is sean cahill .
well , sean , this is mike ross .
what can i do for you , mike ?
you can tell me why the hell
you &apos;re going after jill miller &apos;s assets .
i &apos;m sorry , i wasn &apos;t aware you were her accountant .
well , if you don &apos;t back off ,
i &apos;m about to become her goddamn lawyer .
excuse me ?
that wasn &apos;t part of her deal .
no , it wasn &apos;t , but i &apos;m not gonna let her
keep her money she made committing a crime .
you &apos;re not just taking money she made from a crime .
you &apos;re taking the salary she made
from working at that company for years .
listen , that woman got out of going to prison .
but every time they took a position ,
they sold the other side to people who lost everything .
and i &apos;ll be damned if i let her live high on the hog
while working people &apos;s lives were ruined .
sean , i know about your mother and spain .
but jill miller didn &apos;t take her money .
i don &apos;t care . and i have the power to do this .
and this conversation is over .
jessica pierson .
my secretary should &apos;ve told you i &apos;m not taking new clients .
i take it you know why i &apos;m here .
i tried to be polite when your protégé accused me
of not doing my job with leonard bailey .
but i &apos;m not gonna be told by someone who harbored a fraud
what a bad lawyer i am .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a bad lawyer , georgina .
i think you &apos;re a good lawyer that made a mistake .
and i &apos;m here to give you a chance to fix it .
and how &apos;s that ?
leonard bailey &apos;s alibi witness is dead .
that doesn &apos;t mean her testimony is .
you want me to testify to what she told me ?
that would be hearsay .
it would be if she were alive .
but now that she &apos;s dead ...
she &apos;s an unavailable declarant .
like i said , you are a good lawyer .
and i &apos;m not pretending i let a solid witness disappear
when that girl was a junkie
and her story was inconsistent at best .
and it still should &apos;ve been presented to a jury ,
which is what we &apos;re trying to fix .
the only thing you &apos;re trying to fix is your reputation .
and you &apos;re not doing it by smearing mine .
georgina , a man &apos;s life is on the line .
and i did my best to defend it ,
but i have no obligation to do it again .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
my protégé took the liberty of drawing up a sworn affidavit
which states maria gomez told you
leonard bailey couldn &apos;t have murdered that couple
because he was with her at the time .
now you can either sign it ,
or you lie under oath that this isn &apos;t true .
and believe you me , you do not want to be on that stand
lying to a jury and have to face me .
donna , cancel all my meetings tomorrow ,
and notify the parole board that gallo &apos;s ready .
harvey--
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
listen to me .
i was there with you when you put him away ,
and i wouldn &apos;t be able to live with myself
if i didn &apos;t remind you what you said about him at the time .
i don &apos;t need reminding .
you said he was a sociopath
who took pleasure from hurting people .
donna , i don &apos;t have a choice .
that was before you knew that mike was getting out .
if you just string him along for a couple more hours--
mike &apos;s not getting out today .
what ?
cahill called me .
the deal &apos;s gonna take a few more days to go through .
and if gallo even thinks that i &apos;m stringing him along ,
mike may never get out of there at all .
i &apos;ll clear your schedule .
hey , i need to talk to you .
before you do ,
i just want to say i didn &apos;t mean to
put it all on you earlier .
no , that doesn &apos;t matter now . listen .
you said that when you got arrested ,
you turned down a deal to turn on sutter .
i need to know exactly what they said .
i don &apos;t understand what that has to do with jill .
it doesn &apos;t .
it has to do with the fact that
i &apos;m trying to get you out of here .
what ?
i might not be able to do anything about the money ,
but maybe what i can do
is make it so that you can be with your family .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
no .
they &apos;re already going after our money .
i don &apos;t want to do anything
that &apos;s gonna mess with jill &apos;s deal .
listen to me . that deal is as solid as a rock .
i wrote it myself ; they can &apos;t take it away from her
any more than they can take my deal away from me .
but you need to tell me exactly what cahill said to you
when he told you to turn on sutter .
nothing . he never said anything to me .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m telling you i &apos;ve never spoken to sean cahill in my life .
all right , i &apos;m here .
but i gave you seven days to find that witness ,
and then you went behind my back ,
so you better have a good reason why you &apos;re in here
asking to reopen this case .
we do , your honor .
we found leonard bailey &apos;s alibi .
what they found is nothing but hearsay .
what is he talking about ?
he &apos;s talking about the fact that our eyewitness
died three years ago ,
and mr. bailey &apos;s original attorney
is going to testify on her behalf
under the turner v. michigan exception to the hearsay rule .
that exception involved a written statement .
it is a written statement , and we have it right here .
that is not a written statement .
that is a bullshit affidavit
she cobbled together this morning .
what did you just accuse her of ?
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , but i find it decidedly convenient
that they don &apos;t have the witness statement
written down on a notebook or a scrap of paper
from the same decade that it happened .
well , we happen to find it decidedly inconvenient .
and georgina casey didn &apos;t write it down at the time
because she didn &apos;t do an adequate job
representing her client .
are you now saying that this case needs to be reopened
based on leonard bailey having inadequate representation ?
because that is a serious allegation
to make about a fellow attorney .
that wasn &apos;t our plan .
but if that &apos;s what it takes to give this man a chance
to prove his innocence ,
then it sure as hell is our plan now .
this is ridiculous .
it may sound ridiculous , but if they were able to get
a successful attorney to admit to a huge blunder ,
then i &apos;m ruling that this case should be reopened after all .
cameron , what are you doing here ?
you know what i &apos;m doing here .
are you out of your goddamn mind representing frank gallo ?
you don &apos;t understand .
i understand plenty .
no , listen to me .
no , you listen to me .
that guy was a murdering piece of shit
who should &apos;ve been put away for life ,
and now you &apos;re trying to get him out ?
he &apos;s in there with mike ross .
i don &apos;t care .
well , i do , because like you just said ,
he is a murdering piece of shit .
but what you don &apos;t know is , i made a deal with him ,
and i &apos;m not gonna break it .
then i will .
it &apos;s not up to you .
well , it will be
when i play this for the parole board .
what is that ?
it &apos;s the tape we had of him admitting
that he murdered that man that you shit the bed with
and got excluded from evidence .
i didn &apos;t shit the bed with anything , and you know it .
you try to bring that bullshit to his hearing ,
i &apos;ll march you out of there before you get to hit play ,
&apos;cause it wasn &apos;t admissible in court ,
and it &apos;s not admissible there .
you tell yourself whatever you want ,
but i &apos;m gonna do whatever i need to do
to keep that bastard behind bars .
talk to you a second ?
of course .
you were right .
the whole time i was working ,
i didn &apos;t worry about what tara was doing with ...
him , which meant the first time in my life ,
i finished the billables in record time .
and now you &apos;re afraid to go home .
i can &apos;t help wondering what &apos;s happening .
louis , have you ever heard of a jack story ?
no .
well , it &apos;s time you did .
a man gets a flat tire on a country road .
he sees a house in the distance .
he walks up to the house , and along the way ,
he starts thinking , &quot; what if they don &apos;t have a jack ?
&quot; what if they have a jack ,
but they want to charge me for it , and if they do ,
how much would they charge ?
$ 100 , $ 200 , $ 1,000 ? &quot;
that &apos;s bullshit .
exactly .
so by the time the man gets to the house ,
rings the bell , and they answer the door ,
he tells them , &quot; you know what ?
keep your goddamn jack . &quot;
that &apos;s brilliant .
so you get my point .
no .
louis , you have no idea what &apos;s going on in tara &apos;s mind ,
so the best thing you can do is trust her .
because if you don &apos;t , i &apos;m telling you ,
you &apos;re gonna do something that you &apos;ll regret
for the rest of your life .
all right , donna .
i &apos;ll wait for tara to call .
okay .
can i help you ?
help me what , rat ?
what did you just say ?
i said you ratted on your own roommate .
word &apos;s spreading ,
and there &apos;s going to come a time
when you need my protection ,
and i won &apos;t be there .
hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing .
it &apos;s not nothing . you were threatening him .
you ever do it again without my say so ,
you &apos;ll regret the day you met me .
sorry , frank .
don &apos;t worry about it , kid . i got your back .
no , you don &apos;t .
everyone knows guards are the last one to find out anything .
so if word were spreading ,
i wouldn &apos;t be finding out about it from him .
he just did that because you told him to ,
because you want to remind me of what &apos;s gonna happen
if harvey lets you down .
well , then , i guess you got the message loud and clear .
good luck to me on my hearing tomorrow .
did you do what i asked you to do ?
i did .
you better .
because if you don &apos;t sound like a human being ,
you &apos;re gonna be in here for another two years .
the hell is cameron dennis doing here ?
you let me worry about him .
mr. specter , please proceed .
ladies and gentlemen of the board ,
mr. gallo has served 12 years
as an exemplary inmate .
we ask that you release him
so he can continue to live his life outside these walls .
but before you decide on that ,
we think it &apos;s best if you hear from him in his own words .
you son of a bitch , what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s an action on behalf of my client , kevin miller .
you abused your power when you went after him last year .
i didn &apos;t abuse shit .
i beg to differ .
&apos;cause not only does kevin live in new jersey ,
but his accident was there too ,
which means you were outside of your jurisdiction .
you better rescind this suit ,
because if they come after me--
they &apos;re not gonna come after you , sean ,
because i haven &apos;t filed it yet .
and i &apos;m not going to , as long as you agree to get kevin out .
are you crazy ?
i &apos;m not gonna do that .
why not ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not gonna get held hostage
by the likes of you .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
i &apos;m not denying the person i was
or the things i did ,
because i did those things .
if i could go back and change what i did ,
i would , but i can &apos;t .
what i can do is swear to you
that i will never go back to being that person again .
you crossed the line when you took jill &apos;s money .
no , mike , i didn &apos;t ,
but i &apos;m about to cross it now .
you want to see abuse of power ?
your deal is gone .
if there are no other statements--
matter of fact , i would , uh , like to say a few words .
and you are ?
cameron dennis .
i was the district attorney at the time of mr. gallo &apos;s trial .
mr. chairman ,
mr. dennis is about to play a tape
from the original trial .
it wasn &apos;t admissible then ,
and it &apos;s not admissible now .
no , harvey , i &apos;m going to read
the transcript of your own words
from mr. gallo &apos;s sentencing hearing .
&quot; frank gallo is the scum of the earth .
&quot; he &apos;s a sociopath who has no remorse
&quot; for the things he &apos;s done ,
and he is an animal who deserves to be locked up
for the rest of his miserable life . &quot;
i gave you immunity for crimes you committed
before you got caught .
but your plea agreement says
you &apos;ll never practice law again without a license .
you &apos;ve been practicing law in here ,
which means that &apos;s a crime
that happened after you got caught .
bullshit .
kevin and jill both know that i &apos;m not a lawyer .
you know that and i know that ,
but if you fight it ,
i will argue it in court for the next two years .
and if you don &apos;t drop this thing ,
you &apos;ll be lucky if they let you out a day
before you were supposed to get out anyway .
mr. chairman , i &apos;m telling you ,
frank gallo has changed .
and i &apos;m telling the board he hasn &apos;t changed .
he &apos;s just trying to blackmail you .
that &apos;s a lie .
then take the stand and swear it &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s enough .
mr. specter , this is a parole hearing , not a court of law ,
but if there &apos;s any truth to what he &apos;s saying ,
we need to know .
it &apos;s not true .
unfortunately , this body
doesn &apos;t have the authority to swear you in ,
but i &apos;m going to make sure that we will tomorrow .
i &apos;d like you to think long and hard about
what you &apos;re gonna say then ,
because you &apos;ll be saying it under oath .
mike , i need to tell you what just happened .
i need to tell you what happened first .
abuse of power ? are you nuts ?
it &apos;s the only play i have .
your only play is to walk out of here
when your release comes through ,
not threaten the guy who made that happen .
listen to me .
cahill is seizing their personal assets .
yeah , i don &apos;t care if he takes their house apart
brick by brick .
harvey , kevin wouldn &apos;t even be in here in the first place
if it weren &apos;t for cahill .
no , mike , kevin wouldn &apos;t be here
if he had chosen to roll over on sutter in the first place .
and it &apos;s a good thing he didn &apos;t ,
because you &apos;d be stuck in here with gallo
for the next two years .
i don &apos;t care about gallo .
well , you should , because he &apos;s not out yet ,
and if it &apos;s up to cameron dennis ,
he &apos;s not getting out .
what ?
cameron got wind that i &apos;m trying to get gallo parole .
and now i got to think of something
or perjure myself tomorrow ,
or he &apos;s gonna end up right back in here .
well , that &apos;s even more reason why we can &apos;t leave kevin behind .
if gallo doesn &apos;t get out and i do ,
the first person he &apos;s gonna go after is kevin .
and i didn &apos;t sign on to get someone killed .
no , you signed on to get yourself out .
now if you don &apos;t drop this suit ,
cahill &apos;s gonna threaten to pull your deal .
what ?
he already did .
then why are we still having this conversation ?
&apos;cause like i said , this is the only card
i have left to play .
so if you want me to drop this ,
you get cahill to do the right thing and get kevin out .
i have to say , for someone who practices corporate law ,
you know your way around an appeals court .
thank you ,
but you &apos;re not here to offer me a job as a prosecutor ,
you &apos;re here to offer leonard bailey a deal .
so let &apos;s get to it .
let &apos;s face it .
you may have that affidavit from his original attorney ,
but you have no dna , no alibi ,
and i &apos;m guess not a hell of a lot else .
what i have , larry ,
is a case that will embarrass you personally
every day it drags on ,
because you were the one that tried it in the first place .
so give me a number , so i can get on with my day .
bailey does ten more years , and we all go home .
when you say ten , you mean nine ,
and we both know i can get you down to seven ,
so let &apos;s just say five .
but i &apos;ll tell you what .
you let my client walk right now ,
and you get your dream .
we don &apos;t open this case at all .
no way .
seven years , take it or leave it .
offer &apos;s good 24 hours .
no , this is unacceptable .
well , it &apos;s the best you &apos;re gonna do .
no , the best i &apos;m going to do
is get my client exonerated
from a crime he didn &apos;t commit
and make you look like a fool .
then bring it on .
but you &apos;re legally obligated to present my offer to your client .
and remind him , if he loses again ,
in 60 days his life is over .
thanks , bill .
sean , what &apos;s going on with mike &apos;s deal ?
excuse me ?
why hasn &apos;t it come through yet ?
oh , there must &apos;ve been a mix @-@ up in the paperwork .
bullshit .
you &apos;re holding it up because he &apos;s threatening to sue you .
oh , you &apos;re right . i am .
and if doesn &apos;t drop this thing and agree to walk away ,
i &apos;m gonna dump his deal altogether .
sean , let his deal go through .
once he gets out ,
he &apos;s not gonna follow through on this thing .
&quot; oh , sean , put down your gun .
&quot; i promise mike &apos;ll put his down too .
&quot; and you can trust the both of us ,
&apos;cause neither of us has ever lied to you before . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t trust us ,
you never would &apos;ve come to me in the first place .
if i had known this is how it was going to end ,
i never would have .
you son of a bitch .
we got you every goddamn thing you wanted .
i held up my end of the bargain ,
not to mention the fact i gave immunity to jill miller
when i didn &apos;t have to .
bullshit you didn &apos;t have to .
she made your case ,
and mike risked his life to get her for you .
you had no problem asking me
to risk everything to get that kid out ,
and i did it .
and now that ungrateful son of a bitch
wants to bite the hand that feeds him ,
i &apos;m gonna take away his dinner
and show him who his master is .
sean , please .
gallo might not get out ,
and mike &apos;s gonna be stuck in there with him .
well , all the more reason he should put down his gun
and walk out that f---ing door .
jessica , come in .
i &apos;m sorry to drop by unannounced ,
but i need to talk to you .
no , no , i &apos;m sorry that i had to leave a little bit early .
i just wanted to get the place ready for when mike gets home .
then i won &apos;t take up much of your time .
they offered leonard bailey a deal .
how long ?
seven years .
but i can probably get them down to five .
five more years for a crime he didn &apos;t commit
doesn &apos;t seem really fair .
and losing a retrial
and dying in prison doesn &apos;t seem fair either .
but we &apos;re not gonna lose .
that &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s a good chance we will .
jessica--
rachel .
juries are unpredictable .
even if they &apos;d been told to disregard something ,
they know he was convicted before .
this is a chance at getting his life back .
what kind of life are we talking about ?
he &apos;s still going to be seen as a murderer
even by the closest thing he has to a mother .
i &apos;m not gonna let him die for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
i don &apos;t want to let him die either .
i want to fight to get him out .
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve been practicing law long enough
to make that call .
rachel , this is a win for him .
so get your mind right
so that we can walk into that prison on the same page .
harvey , unless you &apos;re here to tell me
you &apos;ve come to your senses about this animal ,
this is gonna be a short conversation .
i came here to show you this .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a three @-@ year surveillance agreement
with the best detective agency in the state .
and what makes you think just because you follow him ,
it &apos;s gonna stop him from committing crimes ?
cameron , i can &apos;t have him in there with mike .
well , from what i heard , mike &apos;s getting out .
it &apos;s not that simple .
what do you mean , it &apos;s not that simple ?
the sec pulled some shady shit with mike &apos;s cellmate ,
the same guy that helped get mike out in the first place .
now mike &apos;s been playing chicken with them ,
and if he doesn &apos;t drop it ,
they &apos;re not gonna let him out .
let me get this straight .
you want me to perjure myself
so you can put this monster on the street
because your sidekick wants to fight the man ?
don &apos;t play that shit with me .
you &apos;ve been crossing lines for years ,
and you didn &apos;t lose a minute &apos;s sleep over it .
you &apos;re damn right i didn &apos;t ,
because i was doing it to put guys like gallo away ,
not let them wander around at night
hoping some fat guy with a polaroid
is gonna keep him from murdering somebody else .
and what if that person he was gonna be murdering was me ?
because mike is to me
what i used to be to you .
then convince him to do the right thing
like you tried to do once with me .
because , harvey ,
you know what you &apos;re doing with gallo is wrong .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this ,
but i got rachel on the phone for you .
what ?
yeah .
she had my number from the other night ,
and she wants to talk to you .
thanks .
and mike , if you &apos;re staying in here for me ,
don &apos;t do it .
god , i can &apos;t wait to see you .
i can &apos;t wait to see you either .
are you okay ?
yeah , i , um--
i just wanted to talk to you about my death row client .
how can i help ?
they offered us a deal
for him to get out in five years ,
and jessica wants to take it .
but i want to fight for him .
let me guess , she wants to present a united front .
she does .
well , i &apos;m not sure how i can help you
other than to tell you to follow your gut .
you can help me understand what it &apos;s like to be in prison .
you better be convincing out there .
gallo , i &apos;m about to sell my soul
to make us even ,
so sit down , shut up ,
and make sure that after today ,
i never see your face again .
mr. specter .
are you ready to be sworn in ?
ladies and gentlemen of the board ,
before mr. specter testifies ,
i &apos;d like to present michael ross
as a witness on behalf of the state .
mr. chairman , this hearing was called
so that i could--
you &apos;ll get your chance , mr. specter .
i &apos;d like to hear what the young man has to say .
i can have him sworn in .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
mr. ross , you are an inmate here at danbury ,
is that correct ?
yes , i &apos;m serving a two @-@ year sentence
for practicing law without a license .
and what firm did you work at ?
i worked for mr. specter .
are you aware that mr. specter
originally prosecuted frank gallo ?
yes , i am .
and who made you aware of it ?
frank gallo did .
he just mentioned something in passing ?
no .
no , on my first night here ,
mr. gallo bribed a guard
so that he could get into my cell ,
and then he pretended to be my roommate .
and after getting me to trust him ,
he told me that he had been trying
to get revenge on harvey specter
since the day he &apos;d been put away .
then he told me that now he was gonna get revenge on harvey
by coming after me .
was it clear to you what he meant by &quot; coming after you &quot; ?
he said he would kill me .
in fact , he tried to shiv me the second night ,
but a guard stopped him .
just one more question .
was mr. specter aware of these threats ?
of course he was .
why else do you think he &apos;s been trying to get gallo parole ?
thank you , mr. ross .
mr. specter , are you prepared
to refute this testimony under oath ?
no , your honor .
i &apos;m not .
we &apos;ll take a five @-@ minute recess .
you did this .
you were in on it with him the whole time .
you &apos;re right . i did .
so you come after me , not him .
i &apos;m coming after both of you ,
but i &apos;m coming after him sooner .
hey , you can &apos;t hide from me .
oh , i don &apos;t need to hide from you ,
&apos;cause it turns out i &apos;m getting out today .
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
five years is still a long time .
yes , it is .
but then you walk out of here a free man .
a free man , but not an innocent one .
you &apos;re still innocent , leonard ,
whether the world sees it that way or not .
but if the world thinks i &apos;m a convicted murderer ,
then i might as well die in here ,
because there &apos;s not gonna be a life out there for me anyway .
no one said it was going to be easy .
but there &apos;s no point in dying for a crime
you didn &apos;t commit .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;m not doing this just to stay alive .
i &apos;m doing this so one day i can knock on my kid &apos;s door ,
and they &apos;ll know their father is an innocent man .
if i take this deal , that &apos;s never gonna happen .
if you don &apos;t take it ,
it may never happen either .
you &apos;re pretty quiet . what do you think ?
i--i think that jessica
has a lot more experience than i do .
that &apos;s not what i asked you .
i want to know what you think i should do .
leonard , the odds of you getting out--
i said i want to know what she thinks .
i think you should fight .
then that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
goddamn it , i said we need to be on the same page .
he asked me what i thought .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to him .
i never would &apos;ve thought robert zane &apos;s daughter
would be so naive .
naive ?
i was actually starting to believe
that you cared about this case ,
but the only thing that you care about
is putting it to bed as quickly as possible .
how dare you ?
playing the odds isn &apos;t the same as not caring .
maybe not , but jessica ,
i have watched you my whole career ,
and this is the first time that you &apos;ve ever
backed away from a fight .
that &apos;s because you &apos;ve never seen me fight
when someone &apos;s life is on the line .
you--
that &apos;s right .
i was in a situation like this once before .
i did what you want me to do now .
we lost , and it ripped me to shreds .
so when i tell you i have a lot more experience than you ,
believe it .
jessica , i &apos;m sorry ...
that you lost a case like this before .
but the way to help leonard is not to convince him
to take some deal that he can &apos;t live with .
it is to fight to give him something worth living for .
what the hell did you do ?
i did what i said i &apos;d do .
i kept that animal behind bars .
i &apos;m talking about mike .
you cut a deal with him , didn &apos;t you ?
no , harvey , he cut a deal with me .
what are you talking about ?
after you told him i was involved with this thing ,
he called me and asked if i could do something
about his friend kevin .
i said i &apos;d look into it ,
but he &apos;d have to do something for me .
and so you made some bullshit promise with him
in exchange for doing that .
it wasn &apos;t bullshit .
i don &apos;t work for the sec , harvey .
i put away real criminals .
and the person who put away kevin miller
knows that it &apos;s worth it to let a drunk driver out ,
as long as it means keeping a murderer in .
and to hell with what happens to mike .
hey , he went in there with his eyes wide open ,
and gallo can &apos;t do anything to him anyway ,
because he &apos;s getting out tonight .
don &apos;t you get it ?
mike &apos;s not gonna be safe tonight
or any other night , because gallo can get to him
whether he &apos;s behind bars or not .
well , like i said , harvey ,
he knew what he was getting into ,
and he came to me .
hey , where you been all day ?
been doing what i said i was gonna do .
i &apos;m getting you out .
you &apos;re kidding .
do i look like i &apos;m kidding ?
so take that phone of yours , call jill ,
and tell her you &apos;re coming home--
tonight .
i don &apos;t believe it .
you really did that for me ?
i did .
what about you ?
i &apos;m getting out with you .
what ?
i just can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna be tucking my kids
into bed tonight .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna see rachel .
i can &apos;t thank you enough , mike .
all right , let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s about time .
not you , ross . just miller .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m getting out too .
i &apos;m following orders , and my orders are to bring him out .
not you .
you did this .
i didn &apos;t do shit .
but i sure as hell am gonna take advantage of it .
i &apos;m not leaving without mike .
yeah , you are .
and i don &apos;t care if i have to drag your ass
out of here myself .
you &apos;re leaving right now .
harvey , good , you &apos;re here .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
you said you &apos;d reinstate the deal
if mike dropped his suit .
and i did .
bullshit .
you pulled his deal , and now he &apos;s in there all alone .
now if you don &apos;t pick up the phone--
harvey , i didn &apos;t pull anything .
what ?
mike called me .
he told me to hold off his paperwork
until tomorrow morning .
why the hell would he do that , sean ?
because he has a plan , and he didn &apos;t want you to know .
i don &apos;t care what his plan is . you--
listen , he doesn &apos;t want you to know , because he didn &apos;t
want you to stop it , and now that you can &apos;t ,
he &apos;s gonna need our help to bring it home .
thanks , jimbo .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and give me and mike here
a little privacy ?
what do you want , gallo ?
that &apos;s a stupid question
after what you pulled at my parole hearing .
you didn &apos;t deserve to get out .
neither did you .
and now you &apos;re not gonna .
what , you &apos;re gonna kill me in this cell ?
there are guards out there .
it just doesn &apos;t sink in for you , does it ?
those guards out there work for me .
see , mike , i wasn &apos;t gonna let what happened last time
happen this time .
no one &apos;s gonna come run helping you at the last second ,
because they &apos;re all locked up tight in their bunks .
and irony of ironies ,
because of some prisoners &apos; rights lawsuit way back when ,
there are no cameras in cells .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
no , the time for waiting is done .
no , no , no , no , no .
i meant , don &apos;t you want to hear about the camera that &apos;s in here ?
bullshit .
smile , you son of a bitch .
no !
you did not keep yourself in here just to do this .
yeah , frank , i did .
and now all those guards that aren &apos;t in your pocket--
they &apos;re watching this right now .
and it &apos;s 60 feet from that guard station to this cell ,
so if i calculated correctly ,
they &apos;ve got jimbo in cuffs ,
and they &apos;re gonna be opening that door right now .
drop that knife and step back , gallo .
oh , you piece of shit !
doesn &apos;t change anything .
yeah , yeah , yeah . we &apos;ll see about that .
louis ?
tara .
i &apos;ve never seen how beautiful it is in here at night .
beautiful .
i want to tell you what happened .
please .
the reason joshua came to town
is that i told him about you--
about us .
so did you break up with him ?
louis , he asked me to marry him .
and what &apos;d you say ?
i told him ...
i couldn &apos;t marry him
while i felt this way about another man .
so where does that leave us ?
i hope it leaves us where you want us to be .
it does .
it absolutely does .
you here to bring me bread and water ?
if it was up to me , i &apos;d let you starve .
let me guess : you &apos;re here to tell me how much time
they &apos;re tacking onto my sentence .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter how much .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna get to him ,
and i &apos;m gonna get to you .
sorry , frank , but you &apos;re not getting anything
tacked onto your sentence .
your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole
you came from .
no way .
you don &apos;t have the power to make that happen .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
but my friend at the sec sure does .
why are you so upset , frank ?
does it have anything to do with the fact
that every inmate in there
knows that you &apos;re an informant ,
and you &apos;ll be lucky to make it through your first night ?
you think i &apos;m afraid ?
i think you &apos;re shitting in your pants right now ,
which is why i think you &apos;ll be interested
in what &apos;s behind door number two .
you stay here at danbury ,
you do five more years ,
and if mike so much as gets a pebble in his shoe ,
you go back to door number one .
i &apos;ll take that hatred in your face as a yes ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s the same look you had
the last time i put you away .
what are you doing here ?
where &apos;s rachel ?
i &apos;m just here to tell you you &apos;re about to get a visitor .
you convinced my aunt to come see me ?
no , i couldn &apos;t convince her .
but i was able to track down your daughter .
what ?
you heard right .
maya &apos;s right outside .
i &apos;m gonna need a moment .
of course .
i know you only did this so she &apos;ll tell me to take the deal ,
but thank you .
leonard , she doesn &apos;t even know about the deal .
then what &apos;d you tell her to get her to come ?
i told her we found new evidence that her father
is an innocent man .
and she should hear it from you
before we go to court to prove it .
so you do think i &apos;m doing the right thing ?
honestly , i don &apos;t know if you are or you &apos;re not .
but what i do know is , when you care about someone ,
you have their back either way .
you &apos;re ready ?
come on .
hi , daddy .
hey , sweetheart .
did it work ?
it worked .
we did it .
we did .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
oh , one more thing ,
someone couldn &apos;t wait for you to get home .
