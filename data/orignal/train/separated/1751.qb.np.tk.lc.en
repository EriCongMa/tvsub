hey , i read that someone invented a way
to covert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy ,
so you can charge your cell phone while walking .
we had that idea years ago .
how come we never did anything with it ?
probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant ,
and none of us wanted to walk back .
i know the real reason you never made progress with that idea .
you thought of it september 22 , 2007 .
two days later , penny moved in ,
and so much blood rushed to your genitals ,
your brain became a ghost town .
that &apos;s not what happened .
i remember it distinctly
because i had just composed my annual poem
死于1991年9月24日
commemorating the anniversary of dr. seuss &apos;s death .
no one wants to hear it .
why , die .
why did he die ?
old , told .
i was told he was old .
penny is not the reason i didn &apos;t pursue that idea .
oh , really ? since meeting her ,
what have been your greatest accomplishments ?
easy .
sleeping with penny .
getting penny to go back out with him after she dumped him .
tricking penny into getting engaged .
and a few weeks ago , he almost did a pull @-@ up .
i think someone owes me an apology .
well , don &apos;t feel bad .
i think we &apos;ve all been distracted
since the girls entered our lives .
you admit amy &apos;s a distraction ?
oh , very much so .
listen to this . this is from two days ago .
&quot; hi . hope you &apos;re having a good day . &quot;
who has time for this constant sexting ?
well , maybe we have lost our focus .
it wouldn &apos;t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas .
ooh , we could have one of those retreats .
like our own science retreat .
my cousin has a cabin out in the woods .
i &apos;m not going to a cabin in the woods .
did you see the movie cabin in the woods ?
可怕的事情接二连三地发生
then we &apos;ll go to a hotel .
a hotel ? did you see the shining ?
当主角一家住进酒店后 诡异的事情接二连三地发生
we could go up to big bear
and get a house on the lake .
did you see the lake house ?
是韩国电影 《 触不到的恋人 》 的美国重制版本
nothing bad happens in the lake house .
yeah , well , no , not to them . to me .
time traveling mailbox .
the only time that traveled
was an hour and half of my life down the toilet .
fine . then we &apos;ll just stay here and do it .
well , you didn &apos;t suggest a beach house .
you would go to a beach house ?
well , good lord , no-- have you seen jaws ?
导致多名游客命丧其口
so , the guys and i are talking about
having kind of a science retreat this weekend .
i just wanted to know if that &apos;s okay .
you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday ...
want to go to vegas this weekend ?
of course i do .
bernadette ?
girl &apos;s weekend . vegas . you in ?
hell , yeah !
yes !
i &apos;ll check flights .
i &apos;ll check hotels .
i &apos;ll check my underpants .
i &apos;m so excited , i think i peed .
they seem okay with it .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d make it .
why not ?
well , &apos; cause you have a steady girlfriend now ,
and we assumed you &apos;d have to stay home
to lower the food down to her in the pit .
for your information , emily is working tonight .
yeah , one would assume , on getting out of the pit .
okay , let &apos;s focus .
the girls are gone , we have 48 hours .
there are no distractions .
let &apos;s change the world .
thinking caps on . here we go .
ooh , this is exciting . we &apos;re innovating .
i feel like we &apos;re in the facebook movie .
oh . i never saw that .
yeah . really ?
it &apos;s wonderful , and i swear i &apos;m not saying that
because justin timberlake is in it .
yeah , i have it on blu @-@ ray .
we should watch it .
cool . i &apos;ll make the popcorn .
guys ...
in 30 seconds , we went from
&quot; let &apos;s change the world &quot; to &quot; let &apos;s watch tv . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . is that a &quot; no &quot; ?
okay . no . leonard &apos;s right .
we &apos;re here to focus .
didn &apos;t we used to have a list of all our ideas ?
i @-@ i think i still have it .
i did not get a clear answer .
i &apos;m gonna set this down now .
ah , here it is .
i haven &apos;t looked at these in years .
&quot; robot girlfriend . &quot;
mm , that was mine .
&quot; robot prostitute . &quot;
also mine .
wait . i &apos;m confused .
why would you need both a robot girlfriend
and a robot prostitute ?
there &apos;s just some things you don &apos;t do with your robot girlfriend .
boy , when you met bernadette ,
the field of robotics really took a hit .
okay , let &apos;s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with .
all right , no-- here we go :
&quot; ergonomic heated seat cushion . &quot;
no , it vibrates . keep going .
you know , let &apos;s just come up with something new .
you know , a number of significant innovations
have been inspired by science fiction .
the @-@ the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c. clarke .
地球同步卫星轨道被命名为 &quot; 克拉克轨道 &quot;
the motorola flip phone-- that came from star trek .
yeah , and i &apos;ve long suspected that the idea
of an african @-@ american president was stolen
from the movie deep impact .
片中摩根 · 弗里曼扮演一名黑人总统
hey , the future they show in back to the future ii
is only a year away .
帮助解决马蒂儿子的事
a lot of the things in that movie haven &apos;t been invented yet .
how cool would that be
if we could make one of those a reality ?
if we could figure out the scientific basis
for marty &apos;s hover board ,
that would have universal application .
well , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s possible at absolute zero ,
but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions .
oh , i have an idea .
i think i have the same one .
we got to watch back to the future ii !
i &apos;ll make the popcorn .
so , where should we go first ?
there &apos;s a cover band in the lounge .
nah .
but they play barry manilow .
no .
but they &apos;re called &quot; fairly manilow . &quot;
oh . okay .
great !
no !
well , what do you want to do ?
well , we &apos;re in vegas .
i want to go downstairs , get a bucket of margaritas ,
dance until i vomit all over a roulette wheel
and watch it go everywhere .
what if we don &apos;t want to vomit ?
oh , you will . that &apos;s why they give you the bucket .
what ?
it &apos;s my boss .
they moved my field ride up to monday .
what does that mean ?
it means instead of having a week to study ,
i only have two days .
that sucks .
can you start in the morning ?
uh , it &apos;s kind of a lot .
you know , let me do a little tonight ,
and i &apos;ll catch up with you guys later .
you sure ?
yeah , it &apos;s okay . go ahead .
so , um , now that penny &apos;s not coming ...
we &apos;re not seeing fairly manilow .
okay .
hold on . pause .
something doesn &apos;t make sense . look ...
in 2015 , biff steals the sports almanac
and takes the time machine back to 1955,
to give it to his younger self .
but as soon as he does that , he changes the future ,
so the 2015 he returns to would be
a different 2015 , not the 2015 that marty and doc were in .
this is hot tub time machine all over again .
利用屋中的热浴盆时光机回到1987年
if future biff goes back to 2015
right after he gives young biff the almanac ,
he could get back to the 2015 with marty and doc in it .
because it wasn &apos;t until his 21st birthday
that 1955 biff placed his first bet .
wait . whoa , whoa .
is &quot; placed &quot; right ?
what do you mean ?
is &quot; placed &quot; the right tense
for something that would have happened in the future
of a past that was affected by something from the future ?
had will have placed ?
that &apos;s my boy .
okay , so , it wasn &apos;t until his 21st birthday
that biff had will have placed his first bet
and made his millions .
that &apos;s when he altered the timeline .
yeah , but he had will haven &apos;t placed it !
what ? !
unlike hot tub time machine ,
this couldn &apos;t be more simple .
when biff gets the almanac in 1955,
the alternate future he creates isn &apos;t the one
in which marty and doc brown ever use the time machine
to travel to 2015 .
therefore ,
in the new timeline ,
marty and doc never brought the time machine ...
w @-@ wait .
is &quot; brought &quot; right ?
marty and doc never had have had brought ?
i don &apos;t know . you did it to me .
oh , i &apos;m going with it .
marty and doc never had have had brought
the time machine to 2015 .
that means 2015 biff could also
not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff .
therefore , the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac
is also the timeline
in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac .
and not just &quot; never gets . &quot;
never have , never hasn &apos;t ,
never had have hasn &apos;t .
he &apos;s right .
also , what kind of name is biff ?
sounds like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough .
biff .
oh , that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies .
guys ...
do you know that the word &quot; wiener &quot;
comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna ,
or &quot; wien &quot; ?
do you know if you look at austria on a map
it actually looks like a wiener ?
guys , what are we doing ?
w @-@ we sent the girls away
so we could focus .
i don &apos;t think it worked .
maybe after this , you &apos;ll be in the mood for some manilow .
i think after this , i &apos;ll be dead .
look at us out ,
while penny &apos;s in the room studying .
i &apos;m proud of her .
this is a great opportunity .
it &apos;s nice to see her take it seriously .
it is .
but enough about penny .
let &apos;s talk about us .
we &apos;re looking good .
we are ...
better than good .
i mean , look at you . your body &apos;s bangin &apos; !
amy !
don &apos;t &quot; amy &quot; me .
we &apos;re always talking about how hot penny is .
come on-- scientist to scientist ,
how big are those hadron colliders ?
you &apos;re embarrassing me .
oh , don &apos;t be embarrassed .
i &apos;ll show you the divot in my spine .
what ?
no , no , it &apos;s okay . i was born with it .
if you put a double @-@ a battery in there ,
it makes my leg kick .
all right .
oh , this is already better .
there are far fewer distractions in here .
plus , this is where our minds
are conditioned to focus on work .
so , i &apos;ve been thinking about the hover boards ,
and maybe there &apos;s a way we could use maglev technology .
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials ,
we could utilize quantum coupling .
well , i wonder if anyone &apos;s tried that .
go online and look it up .
oh , i can &apos;t argue with him .
it &apos;s right there on the screen .
austria does look like a wiener .
that &apos;s nothing , dude .
go check out how hung florida is .
i &apos;m sure mrs. florida &apos;s walking funny .
can we get back to work ?
yeah ... he &apos;s right .
oh , here &apos;s a thought .
what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques
to keep us from getting off topic ?
like behavior modification ?
yeah , exactly .
did you know those techniques
were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping @-@ pong ?
that cannot be true .
hey , it was match point .
some psychologists
perform operant conditioning with punishment .
maybe we can come up with a punishment
for straying off topic .
not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping @-@ pong comes to mind .
we could snap a rubber band on our wrists
every time we get sidetracked .
mmm , not bad . you know , in medieval times ,
idle chatter was punished with a device called
the scold &apos;s bridle .
it &apos;s an iron cage
that &apos;s locked around the head and pierces the tongue .
if only we had one .
oh ! i &apos;ll check amazon .
housekeeping !
we had a complaint
about somebody pooping on a party in there !
it was us the whole time !
why &apos;d you tell her ? it was working .
was it working ?
yeah .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
you guys look like you &apos;re having fun .
we &apos;re having the best time .
guess who won $ 100 playing craps .
that &apos;s a dollar .
then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress .
hey , penny ... hey , let &apos;s go .
we found a place that has australian male strippers .
we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction .
受地转偏向力影响分别向左和向右偏
that sounds so great .
but i have a little more studying to do .
can you believe this nerd ?
come on , do you want to sit here being a loser ,
or do you want to watch me climb into
an australian man &apos;s g @-@ string like a baby kangaroo ?
all right , guys , look , i would love to go out ,
but i &apos;ve got to get this done , okay ?
so have fun at the club .
and if you get in trouble , find a policeman .
and if he &apos;s taking off his pants ,
he is not a real policeman .
okay , okay , this is obviously very important to her .
let &apos;s just , we &apos;ll help her study so she can get done quicker .
here ... here , i &apos;m gonna quiz you .
i &apos;m gonna quiz you .
i got your notes !
i got your notes !
i got your notes !
if you want these ,
they &apos;re gonna be at the strip club !
aren &apos;t you gonna chase her ?
to the walk @-@ in closet ? sure .
okay , so we agree ,
whenever someone takes us off topic
they get their arm hair yanked off .
and i really can &apos;t let that happen
or the girl who does my eyebrows will think
i &apos;ve been cheating on her .
all right , now , one benefit of quantum coupling ...
wait , no , question :
who decides if someone &apos;s gone off topic ?
i think it &apos;ll be pretty clear . if not , we &apos;ll take a vote .
oh , and also ...
w @-@ we didn &apos;t vote !
we didn &apos;t have to-- that was clearly a tangent .
now come on . back to work .
if we &apos;re leaning towards quantum coupling ...
why ?
you said &quot; quantum coupling . &quot;
that made me think of the show quantum leap .
that &apos;s a tangent and it &apos;s your fault .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
sheldon , i vote that is not a tangent .
thank you . and now i owe you one .
that was your fault .
ooh , that is a lot of hair .
and now i &apos;m gonna hear it from jenny .
everyone stop .
this was a stupid idea .
negative reinforcement isn &apos;t working .
i think you mean positive punishment .
negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus .
it &apos;s a common mistake .
negative reinforcement is really wrong ?
oh , it &apos;s used incorrectly all the time .
even bill murray makes that mistake
in the first scene of ghostbusters .
no way . not bill murray .
i &apos;m studying the effect of negative reinforcement
on esp ability .
bill murray did get it wrong .
jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man .
no !
leonard &apos;s right .
we can &apos;t just jump ahead .
we have to watch the whole movie .
look .
we keep procrastinating .
we saw back to the future ii ,
pigeons playing ping @-@ pong ,
a bunch of countries that look like genitals
and one guy whose genitals look like denmark !
yeah , sorry for clicking on that .
it &apos;s late . we &apos;ve wasted hours .
can we please find it in ourselves
to do any amount of work tonight ?
but we didn &apos;t see them bust one ghost .
so y @-@ you &apos;re saying we should stand here
in my lab on a saturday night
and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop ?
no .
go , busters .
it really does hold up .
see ? isn &apos;t this better than a hotel room ?
yep . shake that thing !
have you ever seen a body so fine ?
we had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class ,
but none of them moved like that !
good morning .
you want to go to the pool ?
come on ... you said it yourself .
only nerds and losers stay in the room .
wow , it &apos;s bright out .
isn &apos;t it bright ?
i should probably close these curtains .
nah . bye !
would you please close the drapes ?
okay .
