We have reason to believe that you have information
about the abduction of Charlotte Clarke.
We're gonna need you to come down to the station
for some questioning.
You are officially my second-in-command.
Gideon? What are you doing here?
You're my big sister and my boss.
My sister stole the company out from under me.
You take the reins, and we partner up.
Now we have the photo we'll use to blackmail danny.
This isn't how I do business.
Well, it is now.
People think I hate you,
no one looks at me when you're gone.
Transportation will meet you about a mile south.
David?
Now this is where it all ends. Fitting.
What have you done?
You needed help.
I had no choice but to check you in.
Help me!
Goodbye, Victoria.
She's Amanda Clarke! She's Amanda Clarke!!
She's Amanda Clarke!
In my lifetime, I've come to understand
that there are three ways for a person to disappear.
The first is to die.
The second is to lie.
And the last is to be reborn.
It was after my former husband's death six months ago
that my transformation began.
I made my peace with those who have wronged me
and with those who I've wronged,
no one more so than Emily Thorne.
Thus, after months of denial,
I've come to see my time here in Claremont as a renaissance.
And I understand that the trauma I suffered
seeing my murdered fiance led to my delusions,
from which I'm now free.
Never lose hope, Victoria.
With your help, I won't, Phyllis.
And on that note of camaraderie, we are done for the morning.
Thank you, ladies.
It appears you've actually made a friend.
Oh, I've made many, Dr. Miller.
You simply have simply chosen not to notice.
Well, perhaps here comes another.
You know, I think I may have left something back in my car.
Ma'am, you can't leave.
You need to come with me.
She has quite an elegance.
Are you saying that I don't?!
Is that what you're saying?!
Because I am the belle of this ball!
You said we were best friends and I was your favorite,
and get your hands off of me!
You lied to me!
Maybe you were better off alone.
Maybe we all are, Dr. Miller.
Well, there's a lot of names in the hopper.
Erase-on manor. Thornehill. The ross supremacy.
Emily's still taking pictures,
but as far as the party signage goes,
a "Happy memorial day" will do.
The house doesn't need a name, Nolan.
Says the girl who doesn't know which one to use for herself.
I do. You just won't accept it.
Oh, Ems, I think I've accepted a lot.
Like when you said you wanted to buy this house,
I redecorated.
You wanted to open the season here,
I'm co-hosting the party.
I'm just hoping that your secret plan
is to make your debut there as Amanda Clarke.
Sorry. I'm Emily Thorne, and it's simply a party.
After what the Graysons put us through,
don't you think we deserve one?
So there won't be any poisonings?
'fraid not.
No arrests or blackmailings?
Nope.
No takedowns whatsoever?
Conrad's dead, I committed Victoria,
and Daniel's self-destructing all on his own.
So, unless you can think of someone...
Nope. I can't. Don't want to.
Then stop questioning me, and let's enjoy the summer.
Hey, Ems, know what they said
about the girl who gave up revenge?
She lived happily ever after.
Going somewhere?
Yeah.
I was just about to come find you.
It's time.
You sure?
It's now or never.
Someday I will repay you.
But where are you gonna go?
Southampton.
I got some unfinished business.
I'll be sending you the bill for her overtime.
Yeah, please do.
Penthouse "B" at the Ripley.
Oh, you live in a luxury hotel now?
Doing what you can to try and salvage the Grayson lifestyle.
You've certainly profited from my family's downfall.
You expect me to protect your reputation
After what you did?
I made you my second-in-command, my partner,
but then you quit with no warning
and still no explanation.
Yeah. You're not the only one enduring family tragedies.
Well, then, you should be fighting to rebuild your life
instead of feeding your libido.
Oh, now I'm supposed to take your advice?
Save your concern for your brother.
Oh, I can handle him.
At least with Gideon, there are no surprises.
You have the right to remain silent.
And you have the right to buy us drinks tonight.
Precinct rules...rookie pays.
Hey, quit hazing my probie.
Don't worry, Porter. Keller's a cheap date.
One beer and he's under the table.
You should talk, Hunter.
So, you want to go throw back a few?
Huh? On me?
Uh, I can't.
I got to pick Carl up from daycare
and don't have a sitter tonight.
I hear that.
I was raised by a single dad.
Yeah, a lot of grilled cheese for breakfast,
pancakes for dinner.
So, first day out there. How'd you feel?
Green as hell.
Hope I didn't make you nervous.
What, on our three traffic stops and one domestic?
Just remember two things, all right?
Why you became a cop and that I got your back.
Why did you become a cop?
Well, the bar is doing okay
but not enough for a college fund.
I guess I thought this would be good for the soul.
I've just seen too many people get away with murder and...
I finally wanted the power to do something about it.
Really?
So you aren't doing this so that you can start
arresting people instead of kidnapping them?
Never gonna live that down, am I?
No. No, you got to own it.
I mean, how many of us can actually say
that we've been detained for a class "B" felony?
Amazing.
Wow, my fitting went swimmingly.
My party outfit is kind of epic, even for me.
Are we playing musical chairs?
I figured I'd drive us home.
Ems, I told you.
I had this little minx custom-made
for our summer of fun,
But there is only one blond allowed behind the wheel.
Look, if you want me to embrace a new life,
then maybe you should embrace some new rules.
Hop in.
Oh, my God!
Are they all right?
I'll buy you a new one.
Are you blind?!
I am so sorry. I'm not used to driving this car.
Unreal.
You know, every summer, you people come flocking in here
like you own this town.
Oh, this is just fanta... you know what?
Just...just give me your insurance.
Oh, we don't need to hassle with that. I'll just cover it.
Must be nice living in your world.
Just bring me the estimate.
I'm in the house on the east edge of coopers beach.
The old Grayson manner.
This is why we need a name.
Oh, you're Emily Thorne.
Yeah, I heard you bought that place.
Been listening to my customers
yapping about your party all week.
Well, why don't you come?
Bring the estimate then,
and you'll see we're not all that bad.
You know what?
If that's the soonest I can get the check from you, fine.
Perfect. We'll see you then.
Yeah.
And, again, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Look at you...solving conflict without a red sharpie.
I'll drive.
Charlotte!
There's daddy. Say hello, Carl.
What the hell?
You don't talk to me for six months
and then out of the blue you pick him up from daycare?
Come here.
I missed the little guy.
You know what that was like for me?
Not knowing where he is, not being able to find him?
And how's that feel, Jack?
That fear, that knot in your stomach?
Thought I'd remind you who you really are
after your first day on the job.
Protect and serve, right?
That's not what you did for me
when you tied me up in that room.
I told you again and again, it wasn't me.
Then look me in the eye and say it.
After all this time, you still can't, can you, Jack?
Charlotte, you're just gonna have to let this go.
Calm down, Jack. You're scaring your son.
Poor little guy...
being raised by a dirty cop.
I had a premonition.
It's going to rain.
"It's going to rain again.
"Rain every day, as though to spite me.
"I might as well hang myself."
It's Chekhov.
I like it. Especially the end.
It worked.
How did you know the orderly would have it on him?
Because his wife is due in two weeks,
which is when men think
they're suddenly vital to the process.
I haven't had that much fun in years...
without acid.
Phyllis, thank you.
Cheers.
The Long Island Harbor Conservancy
appreciates your fundraising efforts, Ms. Thorne.
Well, I couldn't imagine a better event
to break in my new home or christen your new yacht, Dennis.
She looks like a beauty.
Well, she is,
just as beautiful as the woman I named it for.
You have no idea how embarrassing it is
to have your name painted on the side of a boat.
I think it's an honor.
Fortunately, you have a lovely name like Jennifer.
So, what happened to your last yacht?
I'm surprised you hadn't heard.
It was involved in an accident last summer
with a small fishing boat.
A man was killed.
Yes, I remember.
But your skipper took it out for a joyride, right?
That's right, yeah.
It's just so horrible to think about.
Excuse me.
Hello?
This is Victoria Grayson.
I'm being held captive at Claremont Institu...
I know exactly where you are, Victoria.
What are you doing in my house?
I'm paying the mortgage.
You should see what I've done with the place.
I changed everything except the phone number,
A precaution I'm sure you now understand.
Please.
I've hurt you. I admit it.
But you've hurt me, too.
I just want to end this cycle, please.
And I want my childhood.
I want Aiden.
And I want Pascal back.
You led him to his death.
You insinuated your way into my family.
You have earned your pain.
You are exactly where you belong, Victoria,
ranting on like a lunatic.
For the record, Conrad slaughtered Pascal, not me.
And as for everything else I did...
I would do it all again.
Sorry you wasted your call.
Nolan was wrong.
You don't look anything like a stripper.
Jack, you don't need to keep coming over to check in on me.
I'm fine.
I'm not.
Charlotte took Carl from daycare.
What?
He's fine.
She just...she just did it to scare me, and it worked.
My... my partner asked me today why I became a cop.
He joked that it had something to do with the kidnapping.
Well, he was right, wasn't he?
It's a little more complicated than that.
I first thought about joining the force
After Amanda's murder
and again after my brother was killed.
I hated the powerlessness,
'cause I knew that Conrad had the cops in his pocket.
I knew that if I became a cop, no one could pay me off.
So why didn't you join back then?
Because I learned who you were.
Listen, at the academy, they drum into us this idea
that we're working for the greater good.
And I know that that's what you were doing in your own way,
But you know I was never okay with that.
You were waiting for me to be done.
Jack, you didn't have to put your life on hold to protect me.
Well, I'm just glad that it's over...
that you're moving on.
Ma'am?
We're ready.
I'll be right with you.
And, look, in case there was ever any doubt
as to why I stayed in the Hamptons,
It was for charlotte.
She's the only family I have,
And one way or another, I will make it better.
So, you heard from mom?
Yeah, the postcards stopped coming.
Last one said she was in Amsterdam.
I still can't believe she ditched us to save herself.
Can't you?
When the government took everything,
she was the first rat off the ship.
Well, at least you still have the money you made at LeMarchal.
Speaking of, would you mind covering my rent again?
Char, we talked about this.
You know I don't love you living alone downtown.
Why don't you move in with me?
You just want to keep me under your thumb.
Yeah, you're right. I do.
I barely hear from you, and I-I worry.
With what you've been through, you need a support system.
I'm doing fine, thanks.
Well, then, do fine here with your brother.
It's no Grayson Manor, but...
Yeah, you know, Emily's throwing
her memorial day party there tomorrow.
She even had the gall to invite me.
Well, that bitch never knows when to quit, does she?
Yeah, neither do I.
Now, how about that rent check?
Yeah, how... how... how much was it again?
Five grand?
Seven.
Seven grand?
Is that okay?
Anything for my little sister.
Hope you don't mind they put me in here.
Not as long as you stop crying.
This place doesn't deserve your tears.
I'm Louise -- Louise Ellis.
Victoria Grayson.
As in Conrad Grayson?
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm not.
That man was a tyrant.
I see that you've overpacked.
Mother said she was sending me
to a health spa to rejuvenate.
If you're worried that I might cut you in your sleep,
I'm not crazy.
That's too bad.
Sanity's your enemy here.
I spun out a bit after my daddy died last year.
He drank himself to death.
My mom's been trying to convince me I'm still screwed up,
that I need time to figure things out.
I can't imagine choosing this for your child.
Well, then, you're a better mother than mine.
Well, you'll soon learn that this place is a prison,
and Dr. Miller is its well-paid warden.
Took me six months just to obtain a phone.
But you did call somebody, didn't you?
Sadly, I reached the very devil who committed me.
Well, you must know another way out.
Please.
I will lose it in here,
which I'm sure is exactly what my mother wants.
Poor poppet.
Enjoy the trappings of your former life
while you still have them,
because they take everything away from you here.
Maybe we should let them.
You better not disappear on me again.
I won't, Amanda.
Aiden?
No.
No!
Okay. Go ahead.
You made it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This check is for you.
That's -- it's too much. I mean, the estimate's only --
Please, please. To cover the hassle.
Thank you.
Look, I'm sorry I blew up at you the other day.
Just -- just been a really crappy year, you know.
And I guess I just -- I-I expect the worst of people.
Believe me, I've been there.
Not so sure you have.
Just had a really short fuse ever since I lost my fiance.
Too much too soon, I know.
No, no. Not at all.
I lost someone, too.
And to be completely honest, it's been hard
to find someone who understands what I went through. So...
I'm glad you came, Nancy. Would you stay?
Yeah.
Every queen of the Hamptons needs her throne.
And this one even has room for her jester.
You like?
I love.
Long live the new queen.
Cheers!
Look at her,
rubbing my nose in everything that's happened.
Why don't we just rub our noses
into something a little bit more fun?
Right after I say hi to the hostess.
Okay.
Thank you for coming, Charlotte.
I only accepted your invite
because I thought after all this time,
maybe you'd surprise me,
but my mom was right, wasn't she?
This is all you ever wanted --
this lifestyle, this house.
I wish you'd give me a chance to explain.
Why would I give you anything, Emily?
When you want something, you just take it.
Wanted one of these
ever since I saw "Goldfinger" as a kid.
So why are you letting her go?
I don't know.
I guess I realized some things in life
were more important than pretending to be James Bond.
Really?
Rumor is you've been selling anything that's not nailed down
so you can keep pretending your fortune didn't sink
along with your family's.
If you think you know so much, then why the hell did you ask?
We agreed to a lot more than this.
Supply and demand, Grayson,
And your name doesn't intimidate people the way it used to.
So why don't you just hand me the keys?
Listen to me, you son of a bitch,
If I read about this sale in "Page Six"
or in your family Christmas news letter,
you'll see just how intimidating I can be.
Now get out of here.
Jennifer?
You all right?
Nervous, I guess.
I've never christened a boat before.
Champagne?
Well, don't worry.
It won't feel a thing.
Thank you. Cheers.
Cheers.
Margaux.
I wanted to say thank you for the donation
and for accepting my invitation.
Since I'm covering the summer parties
and now you're the one throwing them,
it seemed necessary.
And I was curious to see
how you would erase Victoria from here.
Thoroughly, it seems.
Well, I like to forget as much of my past as possible.
My new mantra.
I regret letting Daniel color my earlier opinion of you.
Well, we've both been burned by that match.
But I like to think he's getting his.
Now that he's the son of the most hated man in America.
Feel like I died and went to Billy Joel's house.
That's funny.
Feel like I'm in "The Twilight Zone."
Porter, I mean, you've got to be
the most connected rookie that I've ever known.
Who's your in here?
She's over there.
Emily Thorne.
Yeah?
You two got a little something going on?
No, it's complicated.
Yeah, uncomplicate it. She's hot.
Her, too?
Come on, as your commanding officer,
I order you to tell me your secret.
Come on.
I'll show you the rest of the place.
Game's in progress, guys. Sorry.
Charlotte, you're stripes, babe.
I'll be right there.
You guys want a bump?
No, I think I'll pass.
Miss, step back and put your hands on your head, please.
You can't be serious.
Ben, Ben, let me handle this.
Look, given your history with her,
I think you need to step back, too.
Hey, you stay right there.
Look, we can't do this to her.
She's not in a good place right now.
Word of advice, Porter, your duty is to protect.
You can't look out for people if you're looking the other way.
She's family.
Fine.
But you get one pass with me.
One.
Your buddy -- he's quite a jackass.
Jack!
I hear you give her so much as aspirin,
I'm coming for you.
Now... leave peacefully...
Or I will arrest you.
Both of you.
Stop!
You can't take that from me! That's my private property!
Sorry, ma'am. Regulations.
She warned you.
They take it all.
No! But this isn't fair!
All right.
Back to your room.
Hey, what's going on? Hey!
Hey, who's in there?!
Open this door!
Fire! Fire!
Open the door!
Thank you, Olga.
Go, Victoria! Go! Go! Go!
Wait for me!
I'm sorry, poppet.
No! Victoria!
Hey, slow down, po-po Porter.
I want an intro to that partner of y--
He left.
What?
I don't know what I was thinking bringing him here.
There was a situation with Charlotte.
She came here with Gideon.
They're dating?
Dating, doing blow --
whatever you want to call it, he's a bad influence.
Yeah. He's a real enfant hair-ible.
I considered working with him at one point,
but his business model is two parts Madoff, one part Manson.
You know, I used to be the only person
Charlotte could depend on.
At this rate, I'll be the -- the one booking her
by the end of the summer.
Oh, I was just saying I want to poach your guest list
for my next fundraiser.
Funny.
Your brother said the same.
Did he?
No.
Actually, I couldn't understand a word he was saying.
He was so high on yayo.
Did you know that he brought Charlotte?
That's an interesting choice, if you ask me --
him going after Daniel's sister.
What do you mean?
Uh, I'm not sure you heard,
but Charlie did a stint in rehab
after an overdose.
She's not the most stable little pony.
I didn't realize.
Just given her history, it makes me wonder
what Gideon wants with her,
as if squeezing her brother out of Lemarchal wasn't enough.
Daniel stepped down of his own volition.
Did he?
Then I'm afraid I've succumbed to idle gossip.
Although, now I am curious what Daniel would say
if you asked him about his night with the redhead.
I've heard the whispers --
people wondering why I bought this house,
how could I live here knowing what Conrad Grayson did.
Well, call me an optimist,
but I saw an opportunity to take something dark
and breathe new life into it -- make good happen,
which all of you have helped me do today
with your generous donations.
So thank you.
Hear, hear!
In that same spirit of starting anew,
we invited the Southampton Yacht Club
to christen this vessel, which launches from the Gold Coast
on Friday for her maiden race.
I'll let her captain take it from here.
Thanks, Emily.
Thanks, everyone, for being here.
Happy Memorial Day.
What a way to celebrate, huh?
My crew left me with the choice
of naming this lovely lady.
I knew I wanted to dedicate her to the love of my life,
my anchor when I'm adrift.
Boys.
Valerie?
You son of a bitch. You named the boat after your mistress?
No, that's not -- I didn't do that.
You're still screwing her, aren't you?!
No!
After everything you put me through.
No, they painted the wrong name.
No, or your said the wrong name by accident.
Wouldn't be the first time that happened.
Jen, for god's sake, don't do this.
I only gave you an alibi to save myself the humiliation.
But now you can tell everyone for yourself...
Oh, for god's sake.
How you killed this poor girl's fiancè?
Because you were too busy piloting your whore
instead of your boat.
I am so sorry.
Jen! Jen!
You crashed into that girl's car on purpose.
I came across her story, and I wanted to make it right.
It worked.
Whoa, wait. What worked?
Manipulating retaliation for a girl
that did not even ask for it?
You wouldn't understand. She will.
Nancy.
Nancy, please wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
I had no idea that your fiancè --
He was the one who was killed last year.
You know when you hit my car?
It was kind of the best thing
that had happened to me in a long time.
It felt good to get upset about something so trivial.
For so long, I couldn't feel anything
but hatred for that man out there.
I got sick of hating.
It is a useless, crippling emotion.
At least now he'll be charged.
Then what?
He's gonna hire fancy lawyers to fight it.
If there's a trial,
I-it would take months if not years, right?
While I live th-the worst day of my life over and over again.
Even if they find him guilty, what's it all for?
Nothing can bring back the people we love.
Nothing.
I'm sorry. What were you expecting?
A "Thank you"?
Leave me alone.
I already made that mistake.
Addicts cannot be trusted to be by themselves.
I'm not an addict.
You are the very definition!
Ems, I have been here since the beginning,
but you shut me out
just like you're shutting me out now.
Why? Because you're ashamed or -- or in denial?
Either way...
...Em, you're scaring the hell out of me.
Maybe it's time for an intervention
to force you to be who you really are.
What if I went out there and told everybody
that Amanda Clarke is alive and well?
And everyone she loved is dead.
The Graysons killed them all.
They left me nothing to go back to, Nolan.
This is all I have left.
That's why you can't let go of Emily Thorne.
Ems...
Get out.
One peace offering deserves another,
unless you're off negronis now.
I only said that so you would let me up.
Why did you really step down from Lemarchal?
This again? I already told you.
No, you didn't, actually.
You cited your family's tragedies,
but family never stopped Daniel Grayson before.
And I know you just like you know
I've never been satisfied with half-truths.
So tell me about the redhead.
What did Gideon say?
I want to hear it from you.
Okay.
Remember that night I invited you over to the Sassen Hotel?
And cancelled two minutes later? Yes.
I'd been partying with this girl -- the redhead --
And I must've passed out.
And when I woke up, I found her O.D'd.
All I could think at the time
was what this would do to me,
what this would do to my name, your company.
So I took care of it.
So you "took care of it."
And, uh, what role did Gideon play in this?
No. What did he tell you?
Oh, it doesn't matter what he told me. And that --
Oh, so he didn't tell you anything. Unbelievable.
Answer the question.
What I didn't know at the time
was that Gideon was there when she died.
He took a photo of her and used it to blackmail me
and force me out of Lemarchal.
Now, I didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect you from my mistakes.
Now, yes, what I did was indefensible.
Yes, I should've called the cops.
But I don't -- I don't know. I -- I panicked.
It seems that's what he was counting on.
As if he had planned it.
He got the room that night. He picked the girl.
Part of me has always wondered
if he just got lucky she OD'd, or...
You think my brother killed her.
Then we have to do something.
Not me. I'm done with him.
Well, are you done with your sister?
Because Charlotte is with him right now.
Hey, slow down. Leave some for me.
I still can't believe Jack ruined the rest.
Jack is a gutless douchebag, like all cops,
Who hides behind his badge and his gun.
That's just it. He thinks he's untouchable now.
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
No one is untouchable.
Hello?
Can we talk?
Well, that depends.
Are we making up or... breaking up?
Stop.
Look, I'm sorry that I wasn't honest with you today.
You asked me why I did what I did.
I empathized with Nancy.
I wanted to protect her from feeling the pain that I felt.
From becoming like me.
She was never like me.
No one is.
You're a snowflake --
a unique, bloodthirsty snowflake.
And that's just it, isn't it?
Like you said, I'm an addict.
That thirst has become a part of me.
I don't know who I am without it.
Maybe I don't want to.
Let me call you back.
Oh, you didn't invite me to your party.
How did you get out, Victoria?
With a little help from my friends.
Nothing bonds people like being imprisoned together --
something I know you're familiar with, given your time in juvie.
Am I right, Amanda?
What do you want?
Arriving here tonight,
I think I know how you must've felt
when you first returned to the Hamptons.
So much hatred in your heart for me
and what you thought I'd done.
What you did.
If you'd only come clean then,
you could've known the truth.
You could've reunited with your sister
and prevented her so much pain,
But instead, you chose revenge.
Now it's my turn.
Then welcome back.
