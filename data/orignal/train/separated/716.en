No!
Let her go!
You and Emily deserve a life together.
I need to mourn my son.
I'm not sure it'll be that easy
to explain all of this to Ben.
It'll be easier than you think.
All this time, I thought the reason
you were always acting so weird around me
was because of me.
Not true.
So what do you say, beginning tomorrow,
we start over?
I'd like that very much.
There's a woman who needs to pay for crossing me.
All I need's a name and a number.
I get quick results.
Give your mama a hug.
You breathe a word about the dosing
and she cuts you off?
Sounds about right.
My legal team found a loophole.
You only remain in charge of your daughter...
until she finds a husband.
Guess who just got married.
You will give me control back,
or the real truth will come out.
You killed your father.
Nolan Ross married.
Well, what can I say?
You miss some things when you get kidnapped by a sociopath.
You know, there are some people
who say the exact same thing happened to you.
Hey, Louise is no Malcolm Black...
Or should I say Malcolm Blacker
after his confab with that incinerator.
Besides, you secretly adore her.
Why else would you throw open your home
for your bestie's wedding reception?
Uh, fake wedding reception.
Okay, the marriage may be fake in spirit,
but it's real on paper.
Nolan Ross is...
...off the market.
And the world weeps.
But not Louise.
She's finally free of the clutches of Penelope dreadful,
rightfully owns her family fortune.
Which, given the size of this party and the guest list,
she's already spent.
Speaking of...
In her zeal, my lovely better half
invited every major media outlet to cover the party...
including Margaux, who RSVP'd oui.
Wait... wasn't there a near-death steam-room incident?
Ah, yes. The Hamptons.
If you don't pretend to forgive everyone you hate,
you never get invited anywhere.
What, do you want me to exercise my spousal veto?
No.
It's been days since Margaux learned the full truth,
and she hasn't said or done anything about it.
So, what's next for Emily Thorne,
now that danger no longer lurks around every corner?
Still going to my father's rescue.
See you later.
A truly heroic story.
That's officer Ben Hunter, one of two supercops
who took down Chief Alvarez's killer
and rescued three hostages.
Thank you for keeping us safe.
I'm just doing my job.
Which I should get to, it being our first day back.
So thank you.
Oh, Officer Porter!
Care to say a few words?
Hey, you still ducking the cameras?
Not everyone needs the attention.
Hunter, Porter, need to see you in the bullpen.
This department owes you a debt of gratitude,
which is why tomorrow,
the mayor is presenting you with medals of honor.
I'm sorry, chief, I can't make it.
I got a friend's wedding reception.
So be late, Porter. The mayor doesn't reschedule.
I wouldn't expect him to.
You can accept for both of us.
Got to clock in.
I need Mayor Laken's confidence in this department.
Make sure your partner's there tomorrow.
Will do, chief.
I received your invitation...
A fundraiser for the Daniel Grayson foundation?
Honoring Daniel's memory is most important to me now.
So this means you plan to come clean
about the truth regarding Daniel's death?
I can't, Margaux.
As much as it goes against my every instinct,
I made a promise, and I have to keep it.
So help me understand how a foundation
in the name of a man infamous for assaulting his ex-wife
will honor his memory?
By helping disadvantaged children
become tomorrow's leaders.
The foundation will eventually transform Daniel's name
from one of infamy... to one of goodness.
I know you, Victoria.
You also believe that justice should be served,
so while I will respect your fidelity to a promise you have made,
mine is to clear Daniel's name.
I told you that if you go to war to with Emily,
no good can come of it.
Trust me...pain and conflict only brings more pain and conflict.
So move forward for you and your child.
It is for the two of us that I must do this.
I hope you reconsider.
I was wondering how long it would take
before mama barked for her lapdog.
Baby sis got hitched to a yankee.
You think I'm gonna miss that clambake?
Now, Lou, I had no idea what mama was doing to your pills.
I swear.
I'm only here to broker peace.
Well, peace requires a compromise,
which is something our dear mother is utterly incapable of.
Be that as it may, she does have your best interests at heart.
Does she, now?
Do you have any idea the lies that she's told me?
They're not lies.
That's for you.
That's the police report from the night daddy died.
How have I never seen this before?
Mama had it buried by Judge Miller.
So that's why he's her plus-one tomorrow night.
If you don't restore the conservatorship,
she intends to release the report at your reception...
Poetic justice, she says,
considering you got married just to thwart her.
Oh, the threats and coercion.
I should've known... you always take mama's side.
There's no sides here, Lou.
T-there's just facts. You...
He was my father, too.
But I couldn't have killed him, Lyman.
I know how much you loved him,
but you're impulsive, quick to anger.
You know you're capable of it.
Just sign the annulment.
So your money tap stays on
and you can continue to finance your campaign?
I mean, that's all you care about.
No, I care about you.
What's your life gonna look like if this comes out?
Do you really think your fake husband's
gonna stand by you?
Read the report, Lou. Save us all a lot of embarrassment.
Your leg's healing.
The limp is better, which means you can save me a dance.
One step at a time, you know?
Which tie should I wear to the first party
that I have been to in 20 years?
Well, the blue one is the only one
that matches that suit... and your eyes.
Never dreamed that I'd be standing here again with you.
I missed out on so much of your life.
Well, we finally have the time to make up for it.
And I know where I want to start...
Your birthday,
the one that I missed a few days ago
and sadly have for the last 20 years.
What's this?
"Amanda Clarke."
I haven't celebrated my real birthday in...
well, forever.
Well, maybe it's time to change that...
You know, to be Amanda again,
reclaim the life that we lost so many years ago.
You helped clear my name.
Now I'm allowed to be in the open,
and I've never been happier.
Let me do the same for you.
Happy birthday, baby.
第四季第十四集
Did you see it?
See what?
I just sent you the first shot across the bow.
It's not too late for me to rescind Margaux's invite,
because that would be so preferable
to a public smackdown at my reception that...
Although, that girl fight would be fierce.
I'll handle it.
Ladies, I am so sorry for being late.
We weren't sure you were coming.
We didn't want to bother you after what you've been through.
But I guess what doesn't kill you?
Spoken with the naivete of someone who's never known tragedy.
For that, you should be grateful.
How are you holding up?
I'm focusing on the fundraiser.
And I hope that you all know
how much I appreciate your participation...
all the calls that you're making and...
Is something on your mind, Heather?
I-I was...
We were wondering, what do we say to someone
who suggests that a Daniel Grayson foundation is...
what's the word...
unseemly?
Unseemly?
Ladies, I...
Excuse me. Victoria.
I believe you're in my seat.
Have we met?
No, not officially... or unofficially.
But I have read quite a bit about you... Hamptons Royalty.
Natalie Waters. I'm new here.
You most certainly are.
Well, I was in the middle of a thought,
but if this seat is that important to you...
No, of course not. Please, you keep it.
Well, why don't you ask the hostess
to squeeze you in between Karenna and Celia?
And if you don't mind, would you also ask her
to send over an ounce of hackleback?
Well, that's caviar, dear.
Now, I'm sure that we could all agree
that anyone who would suggest
that my fundraiser is unseemly
is no friend of ours and undeserving of our time.
Don't you think?
Absolutely.
Well, then I look forward to seeing you all tonight.
To the foundation.
Cheers.
Cheers.
If you want to get your shoes shined before the ceremony,
I'm gonna be dropping mine off.
Did you take a brick to the head or something?
I said I'm not going.
It's not a request.
All right, Chief told me to...
What, to slap some sense into me?
You're comfortable with all this. I'm not.
Hey, this hasn't exactly been a cakewalk for me, either.
I'm just trying to get through it the best I can.
As you should, but you don't see me telling you what to do.
No, I don't see you telling me anything.
What's going on with you?
All I know is,
if one more person puts a microphone in my face,
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say.
But the ice sculpture's all sculpted.
Now you don't want it?
Look, I will pay for it.
I am canceling everything.
Please have them take it away.
Except for the champagne, which I'm going to need...
Okay.
Immediately.
Maria, can we have a moment?
Yes.
Honey? Darling? Yin to my yang?
You're canceling the reception?
It's a little late to be getting cold feet.
I mean, we're already married.
Yeah, well, not for long, if mama has her way.
Whatever she's threatening, we'll find a way around it.
Is there a way around murder?
What are you talking about?
Okay, remember when I told you
I thought there was more to daddy's death
than just his drinking?
Mama said I killed him, Nolan.
And I think she might be right.
Think?
That seems like something you might remember.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I was just 13
when he fell to his death from the stairs.
And you know that...
that's around the time I started to lose my mind.
Lyman... he showed me this police report,
and it says that I pushed him.
Well, mama had her judge friend bury it to protect me,
but now if I don't sign the conservatorship back over to her...
She's gonna tell the world?
Look, is there anything
you can remember from that night... anything?
I remember standing over his body,
crying.
That's all.
But that report says I did a whole lot more,
and there's forensic whatsits, and I...
Red, red, red.
Look, you may be a little crazy, but this doesn't add up.
I promised I'd free you from your mother's control,
and that still stands.
I'm gonna get some answers.
I just need you to trust me, okay?
I gave you the benefit of the doubt,
but your rag made it clear that you don't deserve it.
I am the C.E.O. of the fifth-largest media conglomerate in the world.
Do you really think I know what's being reported
in every single one of my publications?
You didn't know.
That's your play?
Tell me this... what are people to think
when they see you and David Clarke together?
Perhaps the occasional distasteful
but honest mistake of a magazine
is the price of admission when you wear two masks.
Is that a threat?
It's simply the world you've chosen to live in.
Margaux, I hope you know
that I never wanted any of this to happen to Daniel.
Really?
Because it seems to me you put those wheels in motion
the moment you got to the Hamptons,
with lies I'm now fully aware of.
You need to remember the secrets I have about your father...
enough to sink you
and the fifth-largest media conglomerate in the world.
Then you have my assurance
that my publications will steer clear of you and yours.
And why should I believe you?
Because the man I loved died saving you.
And I will not dishonor his last actions
by going against his wishes.
But, Emily...
you do know I do not control every news outlet in the world.
Sooner or later, the truth will come out.
You handle your own empire.
I'll worry about myself.
You promised me quick results.
Where are they?
I expected more from you than schoolyard-gossip items.
I can try casting a wider net.
Do whatever it takes to get me what I need
to expose Emily Thorne.
I will not have Daniel's name tarnished
while hers remains clean.
Thanks.
You know, they frown on drinking alone in this place.
Thanks for meeting me.
I wasn't sure if you'd have time,
what with all the TV interviews.
I'm not gonna lie...
I did have to cancel an appearance on "The View."
But you called. It sounded serious.
It's Jack, right?
I really hope he gets through all this the right way.
Gets through what?
Is Jack not why you called?
No, but now that you brought it up, tell me.
It's just the aftermath of this whole Malcolm Black thing...
The attention and the spotlight.
Guy just seems tortured.
Jack tends to keep things inside.
Yeah, well, I'm a little worried.
What happens when he runs out of space in there?
But that's not why you called.
I need your advice.
That I can do.
I figured that you were someone impartial I could talk to.
Well, that's wrong.
I am partial.
But let's... let's pretend I'm not.
So, go on.
I became Emily Thorne to clear my father's name.
And now that I have, I'm done.
My father seems to want me to...
just go back to being Amanda.
But you're having a hard time letting go of Emily.
When I worked undercover...
Really with the undercover thing again?
You know, examine your subconscious.
Is that story not why you came to me?
Let's pretend that it is.
So, I was undercover for six months.
And you've been Emily for...
11 years.
Right. So a little different.
But there's your answer.
All right, the longer that you're under,
the more the cover becomes a part of who you are,
and then the harder it is to get back to that person you want to be.
See, that's the thing...
I never intended to be Amanda again.
There was nothing left there.
I was gonna clear my father's name and disappear,
then leave Emily Thorne behind,
start over as someone new.
Well, don't make me do that.
Do what?
Imagine a world without Emily Thorne.
快来我家
Sorry.
It's okay. I get it.
Emily Thorne's work is never done.
But if ever it is, I'm around.
Oh, no. Did I get the time wrong?
We were just about wrap up,
but there are a few pieces still available.
Oh, we've met.
At the beach club earlier today.
Yes. Natalie.
You were the one...
whose champagne you drank.
No, I was about to say who's new to the area.
That, too.
May I?
Yes.
You see anything you like?
I'm not much into the Modern.
I'm more of a fan of history...
like the 16th-century French Court I witnessed at lunch.
That wasn't just any seat I took...
more like a Queen's throne at the head of the table,
surrounded by her pawns.
Well, that's a fascinating theory.
Are you a professor?
More like an interested observer on a field trip.
Not much of a turnout, not even from your friends.
And am I to believe that you persuaded them not to come?
No.
That would mean that they're either a very suggestible lot,
or the Grayson name
no longer commands the same fear,
and respect it once did.
It's not easy being Queen--
I mean, if you believe your history.
Good luck with the foundation.
I was hoping you'd be here.
Well, it's your lucky day, you know?
I'm giving out door prizes.
I heard they're giving you a medal tomorrow.
Yeah.
They're trying.
Would you take it?
It's not a problem that I'm likely to have.
They don't hand them out for the things I've done.
We've done the same things.
We've covered up killings.
Yeah, but Conrad was unarmed.
But he destroyed countless lives.
Kate didn't...
Stop it.
Don't do that to yourself.
I took someone's life, David.
Yeah, you know what else you did?
You saved my daughter's life.
I did that?
You saved mine, too.
Like it or not, you're a hero.
Then why can't I live with it?
Why do I feel like a liar?
Well, you are. You're that, too.
It's just that one thing has nothing with the other.
I wish I could believe that.
I wish you could, too, because if you can't,
then something's got to give.
No, it's okay.
Emily's going to use a technique
to help you uncover the memory of the night your father died.
And where did she learn this technique?
Japan.
Trust me, it's very effective...and safe.
The brain allows us to access trauma
when we face the same emotions...
fear and danger.
Give me your hand.
Just focus on the blade.
Don't look at me.
Focus on your breathing...
The blade...
the fear, the danger.
Focus on that night.
What do you see?
What do you see, Louise?
I'm afraid.
Why?
Daddy!
What did you do? What did you do?!
Did you remember, Louise?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Hey. What's up?
Well, you didn't return my calls,
so I thought I'd come by, make sure you're okay.
I'm fine.
Look, Jack, I know it's hard keeping all of this to yourself,
especially when the whole world is insisting
that you tell a story that's not...
I'm not losing sleep
over what the rest of the world thinks about me.
I killed an FBI agent... a bad one,
but still and we lied about it.
We conspired to hide her body,
and now every time I'm asked about it,
I-I go through it all over again.
They will stop... eventually.
Yes, but I still have to live with what I've done.
What are you really doing here?
I told you I was worried.
About me?
Or that I might, might blow a fuse
and tell one of those camera crews everything I've done?
Jack.
I'm running late.
Can't keep the Mayor waiting.
Apparently, he hates that.
Nolan.
Sasha. Kiersten.
Hamptons hellions.
Behave yourself.
Hey, man of the hour.
Yeah. Great party.
Oh, my.
Well, very dashing for a future ex-son-in-law.
Where's the blushing bride?
You southern women won't be rushed.
She'll be down any moment.
Well, when she does grace us,
I want to make sure that Louise says hello to Judge Miller,
A dear family friend.
Judge Miller.
Your reputation precedes you, sir.
I would say it's a pleasure,
but my mother taught me not to lie.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Your honor.
You should take a gander at the ice-sculpture garden.
I've never seen anything like it.
Sounds decadent.
I believe I will.
Mom, are we sure about this?
Louise has been through quite a bit.
There's no guarantee this won't...
She's my daughter, Lyman.
Louise won't get hurt as long as she behaves
and signs the conservatorship back over to me.
Okay, well, if this ship goes down,
I want you to tell me first.
I'll need to find alternate financing.
You'll get your funding, son. Trust me.
This is gonna be a runaway bride of biblical proportions.
Officers Ben Hunter and Jack Porter,
for brave actions in the line of duty,
we salute you.
How does it feel to be a local hero, Officer Porter?
Ask my partner.
I was just sitting shotgun to the best cop in town.
See? Was that so hard, Porter?
Well, the hard part's next.
I need to talk to you after the ceremony.
What's going on?
Louise has gone "Bye-bye, bridey," but she left a note.
What?
"I did it. I'm sorry.
I can't ruin your life, too. Louise."
She must have lied about what she remembered.
She couldn't face me or anyone.
Well, she just admitted to killing someone.
Maybe she turned herself in.
Nope.
She's out in the boonies, not near any police station.
I know exactly where this is.
Let's go.
No, Nolan, you can't leave.
You have hundreds of guests here
and a very suspicious mother-in-law.
I need to talk to Louise.
And I will get you that chance, I promise,
But you have to prepare yourself for what she has to say.
When you find her, give her this.
She'll come back.
Ms. Waters.
New to town and already someone's plus-one.
Such a warm and embracing community.
I'm so relieved you're all okay.
I was afraid a pack of wild animals had gotten to you,
considering your no-shows last night.
Uh, Victoria, I am so sorry.
Victoria, Bobby had a terrible stomach bug.
Oh, no. I understand.
Heather... after I supported you
through your husband's dalliance with that pool boy last summer,
I thought there might be a good reason
for your absence last night.
Excuse me.
No, please stay.
Oh, that was indiscreet.
The point I was trying to make is this...
a friend is like a business.
Investing in the wrong one always proves costly.
And like Heather, I'm sure that you would all
want me to keep your secrets secret.
For example, suppose one of my dear friends' husbands
was sleeping with someone else in this very circle
or that another was using a controlled white powder
as a weight-loss supplement.
But this real friend ensures that your indiscretions
remain confidential
in return for your support of the Daniel Grayson foundation.
So whatever you were planning on donating last night, double it.
Anything less would be unseemly,
don't you think?
Excuse me. Can I help you?
Anna Bishop, New York State office of Mental Health.
I'm here to do a spot check of your facility.
Uh, I'd be happy to show you around.
And abandon the admission desk
at a secure psychiatric facility?
You just failed your first test.
Read the protocol and buzz me in... not in that order.
And I'll need an up-to-date patient list, please.
Thank you.
Emily, what are you doing here?!
I'm bringing you back.
No. I will not ruin Nolan's life.
This is where I deserve to be.
Claremont Psychiatric?
There are very few people who deserve to be here,
and you don't even come close.
I lied to you, Emily.
I lied to Nolan.
I killed my father.
You're right on two out of three.
If you told us the truth about what you remembered,
we could've helped you.
How?
With some other magic trick you learned on mount Fuji?
No.
With Nolan's wedding gift.
It's the real police report from the night your father died.
The one your brother showed you was forged.
You didn't push him.
Well, are you sure?
I mean, h-how do you know this isn't the forgery?
Because Nolan moved heaven and earth
to find the beat cop who responded
to the scene of your father's death.
But I don't understand.
I remembered seeing him fall.
That doesn't mean you pushed him.
Daddy!
I was trying to catch ahold of him.
You unlocked the memory.
I just... wouldn't let myself see it.
And my mother knew the truth this whole time?
She had the judge bury the original report
and create a false one to use against you.
How could Nolan have such faith in me
when I had no faith in myself?
'Cause that's who Nolan is.
Now, let's get you back to your anxious husband.
Well, I guess it's true what they say...
"Marry the man, marry his friends."
Emily.
Thank you.
Well bartender said he'd be right back,
but last I saw, he was hitting on the peacock wrangler.
Daniel died a hero.
Just wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry the rest of the world can't.
Thank you, Jack.
You're the only person who has said that to me.
I heard you got a medal from the mayor today.
I did, yeah, yeah.
And I left it, along with my badge and my gun,
on the chief's desk.
What, you quit? Why?
Turns out being a cop just wasn't the right thing for me.
Too many, uh... conflicts of interest.
I could've told you that.
Well, I don't think this guy's coming back.
Oh, um...
It's soda water with a twist.
I heard the good news.
The whole thing terrifies me.
I'd worry if it didn't.
But I've seen you with Carl.
You're gonna be a natural.
To your child.
May he or she grow up in a less complicated world.
Thank you, Jack.
Since you're wondering, I'm here for the bride.
Are you sure?
I've been honoring our deal, David.
Well, it's a big party.
I'm sure we can put a couple hundred people between us.
Tell me something.
Had you walked in my shoes 20 years ago,
would you have done what I did to protect your child?
Well, I already did, Victoria,
when I had you tarnish Daniel's name.
But you already knew the answer, didn't you?
Just wanted to hear me say it.
Maybe I needed to.
What with New York being such a hub,
she could probably be anywhere by about now.
Next time, perhaps you'll be a little bit more careful
about meddling in family business, Mr. Ross.
Lou-lou! Oh, thank heavens, darling.
We were all so worried!
Oh, cut the crap, mama.
I didn't kill daddy... you did.
You murdered him
and tried to make me think it was my fault.
Well, now, darling, that's a colorful story...
exactly the kind of tall tale you had a penchant for telling
back at the institution before they fixed your head.
It's no tall tale.
I know exactly what happened the night daddy died.
I was in my bedroom, and I heard arguing.
Daddy found out you were cheating on him...
...with Judge Miller.
Ohh! Ohh! Daddy!
I reached for his hand.
What did you do, huh?
What did you do?!
Y-you...
You've been lying about it ever since.
You drugged me and made me think I was crazy,
All so you could retain control of my money.
Yeah, well, who do you think the court is going to believe
when that police report is unsealed, hmm...
A pillar of the community
or your own chronically medicated self?
Oh. Well, that depends.
Which report are you referring to...
Your forgery...
Or the original my husband found?
Lies.
Turns out the first officer on the scene
retired a while back, but, uh, he never forgot that night.
And he kept great records.
This is nothing but a lot of typical yankee hogwash and horsecrap.
Oh, Judge Miller, that is a lovely cane.
Antique?
You mind if I take a closer look?
I can see where we are not welcome here, Penelope.
I'll be in the car.
So, what now, Lou-lou?
Go home, mother.
And if you dare step out of line once,
if you dare step out of the state of Georgia,
There's a bed waiting for you
at Claremont psychiatric institute.
Thanks for coming, mom.
Uh, apologies in advance...
I don't think we'll be making it down for thanksgiving.
Remember we used to do this in our living room,
Harry nilsson playing?
Me standing on your feet 'cause I couldn't keep up,
telling you to stop singing
'cause you were no harry nilsson.
You were such a happy child, Amanda.
I was.
That ended when I was 9.
Yeah.
That's why it's time to start again.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
I can't just... be Amanda Clarke.
Don't be upset.
I only asked because I want you to be happy.
That was the last time that I remembered you were.
Look around.
I've got friends.
I've got you.
Telling the whole world who I am
would just upend everyone's lives.
But I'm happy that you asked
because I didn't realize that I was happy until you did.
Now we just need to stay out of the tabloids.
Yes, yes.
Well, you know, it only takes one guy to change all that.
So then I said...
Lyman.
What are you still doing here?
I feel terrible, Louise.
I-I want you to... to know I-I was not aware
of the full extent of mother's deceit.
Now, you must believe me.
Must she?
You think I don't know what you're after?
You know, you've always been mama's boy,
so maybe this will be good for you...
I am cutting you and your campaign
off from my money.
Party's over, Lyman.
And I believe she means that
both literally and... metaphorically.
Thank you.
I can't believe your guy never came back.
Screw him.
You've got a knack.
I don't want to be forward,
but I need someone
for the Feldman bar mitzvah next weekend.
Are you free?
You have to go.
I do.
I'm sorry.
Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot earlier?
Well, don't go backpedaling now, Natalie.
I was just beginning to admire your boldness.
That was a very impressive display earlier,
how you managed to monetize secrets.
I imagine your foundation is flush.
It's on its way.
The good news is,
there are still plenty of secrets out there.
Everyone has them.
And sooner or later, I may even learn yours.
Oh, I suspect it will be sooner.
Hello.
Mrs. Grayson.
My apologies for the late call,
but I'm afraid there's been a death in the family.
You're going to be very happy.
I'm not losing sleep
over what the rest of the world thinks about me.
I killed an FBI agent... a bad one,
but still and we lied about it.
We conspired to hide her body,
and now every time I'm asked about it...
What's this?
The smoking gun you asked for.
I asked for evidence on Emily.
You told me to cast a wider net.
They're in on this thing together.
Has the plan changed?
Use this to take them both out.
I don't see a problem here.
Emily.
Well, this is unexpected.
Yeah, to me, too.
They didn't stop you at the gate?
Man, I really need to get a gate.
Is this a bad time?
No.
Good.
So...
So...
So, you want to hear about that time that I worked undercover?
Shut up.
