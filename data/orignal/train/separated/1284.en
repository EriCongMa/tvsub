Sydney.
Just one. I promise.
Any more than that,
and I won't sit next to you at the bar.
Sure you will, as long as my card keeps the tab open.
Go order me another Sazerac.
I'll be back in a second.
Okay.
Thank you.
It's a very bad habit.
Well, you're carrying around a lighter, so I think --
Then I realize my fly is open --
has been for the last 46 minutes.
Now, there's only four minutes left in the class.
What do I do? Do I zip it up?
Do I leave it alone?
I mean, I'm new.
Is it better to be the guy who knew
or the guy who had no idea?
And all these thoughts are swirling through my head,
and I freeze.
I j-- go completely silent --
Ticktock, ticktock --
for four minutes until the bell rings.
And -- and what?
Did they all file out with their eyes down,
desperately avoiding eye contact?
A couple students didn't look at me all semester.
Uh, I'm gonna go get us --
and, of course, I mean me -- refills.
Okay.
He's great!
You think so?
Yes!
There's only one problem with tonight.
What?
You!
He's awesome. I'm awesome.
You -- way too stiff.
Maura, relax, okay?
The evening is going great.
Oh, no, it isn't.
Now I have all these water spots on my blouse.
Great -- well, then, think about that
instead of wondering whether or not we're having a good time,
because we're having a good time.
Oh. What happened?
Oh, uh... I have the dropsies.
Do you want me to get you a towel?
Oh, no. No. It's fine.
But since we're telling funny stories, I --
Really? You're gonna tell an embarrassing story about yourself?
Okay, this -- this is a first.
No.
But remember the time we went to the Adirondacks?
Don't you dare.
Jane and I had never tried it, so we went camping.
She really doesn't like this story.
Did you really like him?
No.
What?!
Well, I answered "Yes" the first 17 times you asked.
I'm thinking it's the wrong answer.
Well, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I'm the other shoe?
What do we got?
Well, I didn't mean you were a shoe.
Sydney Allen, out for a night with a friend.
Came into the alley for a smoke.
Two close-contact gunshot wounds.
Sexual assault, you think?
Well, I can't be sure till I do an exam,
but clothing is intact.
And there doesn't seem to be any apparent signs
of her resisting an attack.
Attempted robbery?
Victim's purse was 30 feet away.
No cash in it.
But could be she wasn't carrying any.
Okay, I'll check with the patrols,
See if there were any late-night robberies in the vicinity.
Well, she's married.
Friend gave me his name.
Judson, C.E.O. of a tech start-up.
I pulled his phone number from the victim's phone.
The dress doesn't exactly scream "Homemaker."
No.
Did you check to see if he called
when she didn't come home?
Yep.
Did he?
Nope.
Could mean nothing.
There were five 911 calls.
One of them was a report of a gunshot.
The others focus mainly on the victim.
Nobody mentions a shooter.
We followed up with four of the callers
but didn't get any new information.
What about the fifth?
Burner phone.
We're tracking it, but no luck so far.
Yeah, we struck out on the incident reports, as well.
Interesting.
I called the husband right away,
and when he didn't get back to me,
I got a warrant for his credit cards.
Turns out he checked in to the Merrimac Hotel last night.
The one downtown?
Yep.
Well, maybe this isn't a robbery.
Maybe this is just divorce the hard way
and he checked in to the hotel to give himself an alibi.
The most interesting of the textbooks is
"Police administration:
Structures, processes, and behaviors."
720 pages of pure gold.
You had to memorize all that?
No, but they reserve the right
to put anything from the book on the lieutenants exam.
I mean, structures and procedures, I get, but behaviors?
I mean we're cops. We're pains in the asses.
You need 720 pages to dissect that?
You're gonna do fine on the exam, by the way.
Yeah, we'll see.
Well, you're the best sergeant detective in the building.
They'd be idiots not to promote you.
If I don't study a little more,
they might be idiots if they do.
Well, what's your textbook have to say about that?
Time of death was after Sydney's, but not by much.
What about the weapon?
Can you determine if it was the same for both murders?
You know I can't answer that question now, sergeant.
We know, but it never gets old asking.
How about the same-caliber bullet?
Well, I'll take a leap into the void
and say that this bullet is the same caliber
as the one I removed from Sydney Allen.
Let's assume that both victims were killed by the same person.
I'm not willing to assume that.
Okay.
Let's say that Korsak and I are willing to assume
that both victims were killed by the same person.
That narrows our list of suspects down
to people that needed them both dead.
Interesting that the wife was killed first.
Could be that the murderer knew Judson was here
and wasn't going anywhere.
Maybe. Frankie's getting the security videotape.
Maybe we'll get a look at him.
Excuse me.
Which one of you got the call about Judson Allen?
That'd be me.
Hi. You're new.
Frank...ie Rizzoli.
I'm Nin...a Holiday.
You temping?
No. This is my new assignment.
You gonna need some time to settle in?
Nope.
Allen co-founded a company called Inverta.
There's no public information,
but I found a thread in a venture capital blog
about a Boston-based biogen company
getting a new eight-figure investment.
Turns out the V.C. mentioned flew into Boston yesterday
and checked in to the Merrimac Hotel.
So, Judson Allen's about to hit the mother lode.
Looks like it.
You're not from Boston, are you?
No -- Chicago.
Cubs or White Sox?
Cubs.
No self-respecting White Sox fan would move to Boston.
Hey, uh, thanks for finding us a motive.
Also, I got the hotel videotape.
This is the only person
who exits the elevator during your time frame.
He doesn't want to be seen, does he?
No, but...
I pulled his reflection from the glass
on the picture frame on the wall.
Nice.
Welcome to beantown, Nina Holiday.
Ballistics confirm that Sydney and her husband
were killed by the same gun.
And these striations indicate that a silencer was used.
Professional hit.
That's not what I'm saying.
Sorry. I'm not putting that in your mouth.
I'm saying it 'cause I get to say whatever the hell I want.
Nobody asks me for scientific evidence to support it.
Well, lucky you.
Oh, you wouldn't do it even if the commonwealth said you could.
No, probably not.
The real question is,
why did someone hire a hit man to kill them?
Oh. I'm not expecting you to answer.
I'm just thinking out loud. Thanks, doc.
Looks like a professional hit.
Really?
Yeah, same gun, silencer,
and it takes a lot of confidence
to kill somebody through a peephole.
Well, our guy is coming into a lot of money.
Maybe we start at the company he founded.
This is yours.
Oh, what is it?
Toffee.
I made that up. It's wrapped. I don't know what it is.
You would.
Grover Verben, the Dodgers' lefty lion.
This is awesome!
Who gave it to you?
Maura's new boyfriend.
Must be quite a guy. Bet that's an expensive gift.
You think he's trying to buy influence?
Is it gonna work?
No. But, still, a cool gift.
Detective Korsak? Mr. Harper's here.
I'll be right there.
And this is why
there are no Vince Korsak-signed baseballs.
That and my .128 lifetime batting average.
Really?
You don't want to know.
Really?
I can't believe it. I just...
I can't believe they're dead.
Wish we'd signed the financing papers
at the V.C.'s yesterday.
That's a pretty callous response, Mr. Harper.
No.
I-I just mean that
it would give our employees a chance
to find new jobs while they have a paycheck.
The company's gonna have to shut down?
We've got money in the bank to carry us a week or two,
But...
Judson was the genius behind Inverta.
Without him, I won't be able to fund a garage sale.
So, who benefits if Judson's dead?
Is there some other company that has a competing technology?
The murders weren't random?
We don't think so.
I can't think of anybody who'd want to kill them.
Why is that funny, Mr. Harper?
Well, I can't think of anybody who'd want to kill Judson,
But...if Sydney were the only one dead,
It'd be easy to think
that Judson was the one that killed her.
Excuse me?
He hated her.
Judson grew up
in a terrible neighborhood outside Philadelphia,
Scraped his way into an Ivy League school.
He founded his first company before he graduated.
When he met Sydney,
he was impressed by her sophistication.
So what took the bloom off the rose?
When Inverta took off,
it became clear she was just a gold digger.
She'd found the shiniest fish in the pond
and attached herself to it.
So Judson wanted a divorce.
He just didn't want to give her half his money.
Something like that.
You called?
Hey, Janie. You met Nina?
No. Hi. Jane Rizzoli.
Rizzoli? Like...
Yep. I'm the reason the department has a nepotism policy.
No, you're the reason the department got rid of vending machines.
Nice.
What do you got?
A couple things.
First, we found three $10,000 withdrawals
from Judson Allen's personal account
made three weeks ago.
I thought the hit man killed Judson over a payment dispute.
but if he paid him in advance,
it doesn't make any sense.
You said "A couple things"?
We ordered the 911 calls
in case there was anything that wasn't in the transcripts.
On the face of it, nothing.
But...go ahead. Play it.
Nina pulled down the level in the voices.
A woman just got shot behind the Beacon Club.
That's from the first call -- from the burner phone.
This is the second call.
Send an ambulance! My friend's been shot!
Now, in the first call,
you can't hear any background noises,
but in the second call,
you can hear sounds from the club.
Which means that the person
who made the call from the burner phone
was in the alley
before someone came out and discovered the body.
A witness.
Yeah.
So, Judson hires a hit man to kill his wife.
The two of them aren't gonna rat on each other.
But once there's a witness who can identify the hit man,
Judson becomes a liability.
That's why Judson's dead.
The killer is covering his tracks.
If the girl in that call isn't dead already,
she will be if we don't get to her
before the hit man does.
Purse was over here?
Yeah, about 30 feet from the victim.
Well, maybe he dropped it
when he realized there was a witness.
He had a gun.
If she'd been close, he'd have shot her.
Right. So, if she ran out of the alley,
she just would have kept running.
We would have seen her on the street cameras.
So... she never left the alley.
Clear.
Clear.
Korsak, look at this.
This stuff isn't dusty.
It's homework.
From a high school.
We're looking for a kid.
Well, what the hell is she doing down here?
Techs finished in the basement.
They didn't find any other bullets or any traces of blood,
So, hopefully, our witness survived.
Could be she got herself locked in the basement long enough
she was able to get away from him.
We're checking to see if any cameras picked her up
on the other side of the building.
Nothing so far.
What about an I.D.?
Not yet.
The textbook is used throughout the Boston public school system.
The good news is, only three schools
are offering the class for the summer session.
And we have calls in to all of them.
And I've got a bot searching FBI wiretaps
looking for the names of local guys
who might have done the hit.
It's a long shot, but...
Well, I don't know what a bot is,
but I appreciate the effort.
What do you think of her?
Who? Nina?
Yeah.
She seems all right -- helpful.
Least likely to leave cheeto crumbs on the keyboard.
Why?
She's our new homicide hire.
What?
Yeah. I got wind of a chicago P.D. uniform
that was transferring in the department.
So, why isn't she on the streets?
She wanted to make a change.
Didn't think it'd be received well back home.
There's got to be more to it than that.
Probably, but what I cared about --
she has a perfect service record,
a clean psych eval,
and B.P.D. bought my argument that for now,
we'd be better off with a dedicated bric homicide analyst
than another detective.
What about Frankie?
Same job. He just got a new employee.
You did this so it'd be easy on me, didn't you?
I did it because it's the best thing for the unit.
Grover Verben.
That kid's parents didn't do him any favors.
Ma, that's not the point. It's a fantastic gift.
Amazing.
Why'd you spill all over it?
I didn't!
It hit the coffee cup, and that spilled,
and then it rolled into --
So it's the ball's fault?
Please?
Please, can you get it out? Please?
It won't be easy.
But you can do it. You can.
Remember when I spilled motor oil on my communion dress?
I mean, when you were finished with it, it looked like new.
All right, give me some time
and, uh, I'll work my magic.
Thank you, because I checked online,
and a replacement is 500 bucks.
I'm sure it is.
Look -- a little white vinegar gently rubbed around it.
I'll make it look like new.
But worse comes to worst,
you tell Maura that y-you had an accident.
As a last resort. Come on.
Her new boyfriend gives me a fantastic gift,
I don't want to tell her I ruined it.
All right. Stop worrying. I'll fix it.
You can do it, ma. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
You can do it.
Thank you, ma!
Who's that?
Nina's bot found five guys who could have done the hit.
Of those, one's dead, two are in jail,
leaving these two handsome fellows
as our most likely local suspects.
Judson's business partner said
he was from the rough side of philadelphia.
We should check to see if he contacted anyone back home.
Girl named Tasha Williams
takes that physics class at Monroe high school.
She didn't show up to class today.
No one called to say she'd be absent.
Can you get us directions to the high school?
I'll send them to you in the car.
What is it?
It's directions.
Nina will send them to you while you're standing right there.
Hi.
What are you doing home in the middle of the day?
Oh, I was working on a file in the bathtub last night,
and I forgot to bring it back to the office.
Is that relaxing?
Well, a bath releases stress responses,
which is good for my hippocampus,
that helps memory and learning,
which helps me arrive at new solutions to problems.
And since not being able to figure things out
sparks a negative response
from my sympathetic nervous system,
the bath works on all fronts.
I like a bath, too.
I catch up on my people magazines.
Where did that come from?
What?
Uh, that's my, uh, Blober Beiber, uh, N-Nurr ball.
Grover Verben.
It was Jack's, and he gave it to Jane.
Yes. That was so nice of him.
What a lovely gift.
It's a family heirloom.
Yeah, but what is it doing here?
Angela?
Maura?
Let it go.
Stop!
Stop it! Stop it!
"Grover ver"?
The "ben" is silent.
The "ben" is not silent. It's missing.
What happened to it?
I don't know. Maybe he got tired signing all those autographs.
All right, Jane spilled coffee on it,
and she asked me to get the stain out.
Well, you did.
It's just too bad the stain was on the signature.
I know. I made it worse.
Jane brought it to me
because she thinks I'm some kind of whiz with the stain removal.
Yeah, she did say once
that you got motor oil out of her communion dress.
Yeah. Kind of. I-I bought her a new one.
So you kind of didn't.
It's mom logic.
Don't worry.
It's not a big deal.
Yeah, it will be to Jane when she finds out.
She doesn't want to hurt Jack's feelings.
She doesn't? That's sweet.
No, and I think it's totally neurotic.
It's sweet.
So it doesn't matter that I erased half his name?
It'll matter to Jane.
I hate baseball.
Tasha is a wonderful young woman.
It's remarkable how well she does here,
given her circumstances.
Which are what?
I'm almost certain she's homeless.
Almost certain?
She's guarded about anything personal.
Clean but often wears the same outfit one day to the next,
And there's no phone number on file.
Those are giveaways.
Any idea where we might find her?
We have an address on file.
But I don't think she's there.
Even her family is looking for her.
Her family?
An uncle was in this morning.
He said they hadn't seen her in a couple of days.
He came to school to make sure she was okay.
Is this him?
He didn't have a beard, the hair was lighter,
but there's definitely a similarity.
He's shaved his beard. I'll update our bolo.
Can you tell me about the uncle?
He said the family was worried
and wanted to know if Tasha had come to school.
I asked his name
to check if he was one of her responsible parties.
He wasn't, so I told him
I couldn't give him any information.
And then he left?
Not right away.
The phone rang,
and there was nobody there when I picked it up.
Okay.
Can you call us if he comes back?
Thank you very much.
He got a look at her records.
He's got all her information --
an address, social security number.
How did he get here?
She was doing homework in the basement.
Maybe he saw a backpack, a textbook.
Until we catch this guy, everything's by the book.
I want you to promise me
you'll follow B.P.D. protocols no matter what.
Yeah, fine, fine.
Maybe I'll make lieutenant
and you'll get to work with someone new --
who doesn't know you as well as I do.
I hope you do make lieutenant.
I'm gonna put superglue on your big, fancy chair.
I wouldn't expect anything less.
Uniforms went to the address Tasha had on file with the school.
It was an abandoned building.
Any evidence she was there?
Looks like maybe not for a while.
But the big news is this.
We tracked down her parents.
They're both dead.
Dad -- five years ago of an aneurysm.
Mom -- 18 months ago, cancer.
All right. Well, then, why isn't she in foster care?
Social services think she's in the custody of her grandmother.
And I'm sure all the information on her grandmother is bogus.
100,000%.
Extreme bogosity.
But let me get this straight.
Teenager scams social services, and she's living on the street,
taking care of herself for at least 18 months
while going to school?
And maintaining a B-plus average.
How does she survive?
Well, if her parents are dead,
She's entitled to survivor benefits from social security.
Give her enough money to live on -- at least the basics.
Any chance the S.S.A. will give us
the address they've been mailing the checks to?
It'll take time.
Well, she's got to cash them somewhere.
Can you look up those check-cashing places?
Look for one around the crime scene, her school,
and that abandoned building she lived in.
We'll have to split up.
I don't like it -- not with a hit man out there.
Yeah, but what other choice do we have?
Hold on -- this guy killed a woman,
then he killed the guy that hired him to do it,
and now he's trying to kill this girl
that witnessed the first murder.
Vests -- everybody.
Okay.
Jane?
It's in the car.
Yeah, I recognize her. She hasn't been in this month.
But checks come in Tuesday,
so she'll probably be in wednesday.
Any chance you could pull security video from the last month?
Maybe she came in with somebody.
I can't even go in the room with the recorder.
The manager yells at me.
I tend to spill.
I find it hard to believe
that a man like you could be bullied.
Well, I wouldn't say "Bullying," really.
That's kind of a strong --
You know what I think?
I think he's using his aggression to cover his fear.
He's the manager.
He feels threatened.
By...?
Exactly.
He sees what I see
a man that challenges authority.
Sometimes I'm late, and I don't even call.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
I think you're gonna have a chain of these places
and that manager's gonna work for you.
Unless...
Forget it.
Um...thank you very much for your time.
No! Wait!
Unless what?
Unless you decide what's right and what's wrong.
A girl's life is at stake here, and you can help her.
We've got a terrible connection. Where are you?
Grand street. I got a lead on Tasha.
It's a partial address from her social security check.
Well, that's a start.
Let's meet at B.P.D. and --
Listen, I'm gonna --
I'm gonna look around... okay?
I can't hear you, Jane.
Hello?
Korsak, I can't hear you, all right?
So I'll call you if I find something definitive.
Tasha?
Tasha, my name is detective Jane Rizzoli.
I'm just here to help.
Tasha, you here?
Wait! No!
Tasha, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Open the door.
Please.
You're in danger!
He's looking for you.
Please.
I know what you saw!
Please, honey!
I know what you saw. I know you're scared.
Please.
Come on.
If I can find you, he can find you.
Okay?
Please open the door.
Show me your badge.
I just want to protect you. That's all.
You all right?
Okay.
That's -- that's my car right there. Okay?
I just want to take you to B.P.D. Headquarters,
and -- and we'll get you someplace safe.
All right?
Okay?
Come on.
Get up, baby.
Just hang on.
It's okay.
Just hang on.
Okay.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right. We're safe.
We're between floors, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna sleep now.
No, no, no. Tasha. No, no, no, no.
No. Hey! Hey. You stay with me, okay?
You stay awake. Okay?
Okay.
Um...here.
Listen to me, okay? Listen to me.
Listen to me.
All right? This is real important, okay?
There, uh...
There are three criminals, okay?
And they were sentenced to exile in the desert.
Okay? - What are you -- what?
It's a joke. It's a joke.
Don't talk. You'll mess up my rhythm.
All right.
The first criminal says...
All right.
"I brought a loaf of bread, so if I get hungry,
I have something to eat."
And the second criminal says, "Oh, yeah?
"Well, I brought a canteen.
If I get thirsty, I got something to drink."
And the third criminal,
He looks at these guys like they're idiots, you know?
'cause he's a lot smarter than they are.
He's real proud of himself, right?
And he says, "Oh, yeah? "Well, I brought a car door,
So if I get hot, I can roll down a window."
That's terrible.
Yeah.
You're sneaky.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, baby. I knew that was gonna hurt.
You were shot, too.
Yeah, but I was dressed for it.
I want you to keep pressure on that, okay?
And I'm gonna get some help.
Oh, come on.
I can never get service in this building.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Look.
I've always wanted to use one of these things.
Okay?
No.
It's all right.
It's all right. Okay?
My team knows where we are, okay?
They'll be here in no time.
It's all right, baby. Hang on.
You find Jane yet?
Nobody's heard from her. She's not picking up her phone.
I'm triangulating pings from her last call,
But it's still a six-block radius on grand.
We should have something soon.
No, let's go now.
I want to be close by when she does call. Come on.
Come on!
I took auto shop when I was in high school.
I hot-wired a volvo for my final.
No more jokes, please.
Who's joking? Huh?
Connelly group.
This is detective Jane Rizzoli.
I'm in an elevator in one of your buildings,
and I need assistance, both police and ambulance.
Copy that. First, I need your exact location.
You have my location. I'm on a phone in one of your buildings.
Check your screen.
Connelly group manages 63 buildings in and around boston.
Uh, it -- it's the one under construction.
We have eight under construction.
None of them are wired in.
Okay. Okay. I-it's the one on Grand street.
We have two on grand.
You call the Boston police department,
And you tell them there's an officer in distress.
Inform sergeant detective Korsak.
Send them to this street.
Patch me through to dr. Maura isles
in the medical examiner's office, and do it now!
Got it. Stay on the line.
Try making a left.
I don't want to risk getting stuck in traffic.
If we take the bridge, we can get a clear signal.
Rizzoli.
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Got it.
Jane's in a building on the 2000 block on Grand.
She's stuck in an elevator with Tasha.
Get more cars there fast. Nina, call an ambulance.
Did you hear about the girl?
The 14-year-old who came up with the new energy source?
Um, sorry. One sec.
Ah, no, forget it.
What was the energy source?
So, body heat.
It took her four months to come up with the algorithm,
But she actually came up with the idea...
...during a dream, and --
Get it.
No. Go on.
I'm sorry. Okay.
Hello.
Dr. Isles, this is Tim Curran.
I'm a security guard with the Connelly group.
I have an officer in distress in need of assistance.
Put him on.
You're connected.
Maura, it's Jane. I'm in an elevator.
Jane? Are you okay?
I'm with Tasha. And she's hurt.
She got a gunshot to the brachial artery.
Is everything all right?
Okay, Jane, you need to apply direct pressure to her wound.
Yeah, yeah, I did that.
Good.
Now, where are you?
Grand street. I don't know the address.
It's the 2000 block.
Jane, are you okay?
Yeah.
Uh, he took a shot at me, but I was wearing my vest.
I'm fine.
I'm coming.
Sir, keep us connected.
And if you lose me, call me back.
I'll drive.
What else can I do?
Jane, you've got to get her out of there.
I can't. We're trapped.
Has she lost a lot of blood?
Yeah.
Okay, she's gonna go into shock, so you need to keep her awake,
and she needs an ambulance right away.
Okay. Hold on.
Okay, Tasha.
I got to leave you for a second, okay?
I want you to talk to my friend Dr. Isles, okay?
Okay.
Hi, Tasha.
Dr. Isles.
No, call me Maura.
You know, in the second grade,
I had a friend named Tasha.
And she had this dream of becoming an electrical engineer.
What do you want to be?
I haven't decided yet.
Well, we all have dreams, even if we're afraid
that if we say them out loud, they might become less real.
I don't know you.
Which is why I'm the perfect person to tell.
Tasha? Are you there?
Doctor...
Please -- call me Maura.
I want to be a doctor...
an oncologist -- so I can save someone else's life.
You stay awake, okay?
Oh, God.
Here.
Here.
Okay. I'm gonna go -- hey.
All right?
Maura, you just keep talking, all right?
Don't stop talking.
I can do that.
Here. Okay?
I'll be right back.
Hang on.
Tasha, did I tell you that the pioneering oncologist
who elevated chemotherapy to a viable treatment option
was a woman -- Dr. Jane Wright?
She died in 2013.
Yes. She was 93.
And she was black.
Yes, she was.
My dream isn't a dream.
It's a path.
Dr. Jane Wright's path.
It's an excellent path, Tasha,
and I'm sure you'll walk it.
Tasha, are you there?
Tasha, you need to keep talking to me.
Tasha!
All right, go faster.
Geez. We're almost there, Tasha.
I need you to stay with me.
What?
There's two.
Take that one.
Get me if you find her.
Stay off the walkie.
We don't want this guy finding us before we find Jane.
I'll keep tracing her phone.
Nina, get him. Jane's in here.
Elevators?
Look.
Stairs.
Sorry, ma'am, but I can't let you through the tape.
I'm Dr. Maura isles, the chief medical examiner.
I know the condition of the people inside.
I need to work with the EMTs to prepare proper triage.
Okay.
Thank you.
Uh, sorry, sir.
I'm -- I'm with her.
Okay.
Wait for me.
I want to help.
You are helping.
You're here.
Janie?!
Jane. Jane?
Janie? Hey.
What? Where...?
The EMTs are working on her, Jane.
I'll see you at the hospital.
You did good, Jane.
You did really good.
