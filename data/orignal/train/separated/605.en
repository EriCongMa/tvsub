Why did Frankie call us here?
I don't know,
some financial prospect that could put the school in the black.
Which always confuses me,
because black means bad, when it's a cat or a banana,
or a shirt that makes you think you've lost more weight than you have.
Nice save. Sorry about that, man.
What?
Did someone use the word black and
now you want me to give you the all clear?
Please tell me that won't be my role in this group.
I have a brain the size of Jupiter.
I'm nobody's forth Ghost Buster.
No, I promise, this group does not think that way.
In fact, before you got here, they had two.
No.
They had to often step back and
remind themselves that they weren't one collective ray of light.
Is this a cult?
Are you gonna eat me?
No, we're fine.
I lived in New York.
Speaking of which, midterms are over and
I was thinking we could have a party at our apartment.
Abed, Annie?
You can have a party.
You can't have a rager.
We have a rule against more than eight guests.
Eight guests?
That's not, not a rager, that's not a party.
Nice grammar.
Okay, you have a rule against parties,
which I'm sure is a world record for uptightness,
so let's celebrate that.
I'll bring the booze and more than eight guests.
Britta you just moved in,
you don't even have a real bedroom.
You're a coucher.
She sleeps on the couch.
She's a coucher.
So I get nothing?
You get a couch.
You get a home.
There's no government to overthrow here.
I'm not overthrowing.
You're overthrowing it by say-so.
Nice irony.
Can we focus on this, because now this is happening.
Hello, everyone.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm attending our meeting using what's called a telepresence robot.
I resent the idea that this would alarm me.
These bots have been revolutionizing the private sector,
and now the state of Colorado has come to us with a unique.
Proposition.
Seamless, Frankie.
The Department of Corrections will pay us money
if we allow a small manageable
number of inmates to attend Greendale using these.
Now, hold on, are you trying to tell me that prisoners
would use these things to come to our school?
That's the black guy in every sci-fi movie.
I'll allow it.
Wait, prisoners, rolling around the school with students?
They'll rape us.
They'll rape us all.
They can't rape you because
their genitals will be hundreds of miles away.
From each other?
This is an attempt at rehabilitation.
The prison is looking for ways to expose their
inmates to a real world academic environment.
Okay, I've heard enough.
I'm responsible for this school.
I won't have hardened criminals exposing themselves to it.
That's the response they're getting from everyone,
which is why the state is offering a $300,000 incentive.
We'll do it.
Dean, do it.
300,000 for the school.
They're convicts.
They're iPads on sticks.
As someone that got paid to keep people out, let me tell you.
Hey, guys?
I'm moonwalking.
Not every bad guy ends up in prison,
and not every prisoner is a bad guy.
Who's this guy?
300,000!
Oh, yeah.
Jeffrey, you know ordinarily I do anything you say.
Do it.
Let's do it.
Oh, I walked into that one.
Gross, who farted? Oh, wait, nevermind.
第六季 第五集
I'm so glad you talked me into this,
$300.000, look at us,
running the school together.
No, if I'm running the school, pay me more.
Oh, what if I made you professor emeritus?
We could have a little ceremony.
Does it pay more?
No.
Then give me what the ceremony would cost.
Okay, folks welcome.
I, I believe you all have maps of our campus.
And this is your dean.
Dean?
Now, if I see any race gangs forming,
I will have no choice but to adjust
the contrast on your screens until you all look the same.
And, we have a very strict no bullying policy
that relates directly to me.
So be nice to me.
No need to be nervous.
We're all here because we done some bad stuff,
but we ain't here do anymore.
Aw, that's very folksy. Thank you.
So, I guess just.
Roll forth and rehabilitate!
They can see us and we can see them so.
Welcome.
All right, knock it off.
No one at this school, should pick on any class of people.
It's like watching magicians bully jugglers.
What's your name?
Willie.
Willie. Take a seat.
I'm Mr. Jeff Winger, I teach Fundamentals of Law.
Does that mean you can teach me how to get out?
Probably not.
I was a phony lawyer, I got caught,
and now I teach a pretty phony class.
It's an automatic A, but you might learn a thing or two.
And I mean literally a thing or two, cool?
And the call me the criminal.
Trust me, I know the main difference between us,
is an orange jumpsuit.
You have an iPad.
Yeah, and I'm a murderer.
Now now, don't worry, I ain't proud of it.
Just don't hide it.
You know, once you take another man's life,
the least you can do is carry it with you.
Are you carrying any murders, Mr. Winger?
I am not.
I hear you have to have strong feelings for someone you kill.
I try to reserve that stuff for myself.
All right. That's enough law.
Who wants to watch Planet Earth?
Oh, look.
Ice World.
Oh, the majesty,
rhinos and elephants.
Hey, Abed.
Haven't you been in our apartment longer than Annie?
Oh yeah. I remember when she first moved in.
That's back when I was so worried about pacing,
I was constantly laying groundwork for pop back gag's.
Hey Annie, I'd like to make this moment worth popping back
to from some point in the future.
I don't know what that means.
There, don't worry, it'll pay off.
Hey Troy.
I'm glad I kicked that habit,
it was getting a little joyless.
What I'm saying is, by Annie's logic.
You're saying I was first in the apartment,
so I could overrule Annie and let you have a party,
but I don't get anything out of parties.
They're like conventions for every subject,
too boring to have their own convention,
and instead of Joss Whedon, the police show up.
The police also showed up
when you made Leonard take off his clothes
and filled the living room with lizards.
That was from my movie, Reverse Godzilla.
I also thought I might make a good pop back.
I make movies, Britta.
I make movies, Annie makes rules,
you make parties, her rules cancel out your parties,
but I'm not involved, I just make movies.
Hey there.
Evening, Mr. Winger.
Willy, you're here late.
Yeah, taking some night classes.
Trying to take full advantage, you know?
Is this your car?
It's nice.
Looks like you're taking full advantage too.
Yeah. It's a real dream gig.
Mm, sarcasm, slick words, cock of the walk.
What are categories in prison jeopardy?
Hey, you mind helping me out with something?
I think I lost a ball bearing.
It rolled down them stairs.
Lost a ball bearing?
Mm-hm, down them stairs.
You want me to look down these stairs?
Okay.
Did you just try to murder me?
Are you trying to murder me?
You're trying as hard as you can right now to kill me.
Okay well...
I guess I'll see you in class tomorrow,
guy who tried to murder me.
Oh I'll see you in class tomorrow, Mr. Winger.
I will see you, yeah I'll see you.
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Winger.
So we are having a party?
Annie, you know me better than that,
this is all set dressing,
I'm helping Abed produce his next film.
Britta's Party,
based on a true story of fun and no rules.
Fade in before a party.
People start coming over, way more than eight.
It becomes a rager, everyone has a great time
and parties like there's no tomorrow, then they leave.
Sophia cleans up, the end.
We're very interested in you for the role of Sophia.
I see the real time stakes of Can't Hardly Wait,
the subversive raunch of Risky Business,
and the mumbly pointlessness of everything after 2003.
Yeah, but real.
Totally real.
The first movie to capture the heart of a real party.
The sensation that there's no tomorrow,
the transcendence of time and mortality.
Bravo Britta, very clever.
Me?
Don't look at me, I could never greenlight a project this big,
I moved in third, I am a coucher.
She's a coucher.
I sleep on a couch!
I sleep on a couch!
Oh, she's a coucher!
I'm a coucher!
Who was it?
It's a coucher! Oh, boy.
Okay, good night.
Good night.
Before this is over, you'll beg for my forgiveness.
So, we have an ultimately low stakes,
but nonetheless creepy problem with one of our Y felons.
You mean Willie?
Yes.
What else did he do?
Did he steal a driver's ED simulator?
Did he start an illegal game of solitaire on his face?
Jeffrey, he's in the room.
Hey, Mr. Winger.
Why is he on your laptop?
He came to me for a chat this morning.
He's here for an education, Jeffrey,
and he reports to the prison.
Could you do a little more in your class than show Planet Earth?
You're telling on me?
He tried to murder me last night.
What?
Now hold on.
Now where I'm from,
if you accuse somebody of something, you better have evidence
or he better be a minority.
He tried to push me down the stairs.
That's ridiculous.
It was ridiculous,
but this is not someone who should be interacting with students.
And you're seriously taking his word over mine.
Well, have you ever killed anyone Jeffrey?
Why would an actual murderer
want to kill a community college teacher.
Now I'm not worth murdering.
Why would I lie?
Isn't that your specialty?
Your rocking tour.
You charm people with your slick and fancy words.
Willy, Willy just charms them.
Oh my God.
I should leave you two alone. I've got class,
some of us came here to work.
Jealousy isn't a crime, Jeffrey,
but costing the school $300, 000 will be.
So be a good teacher, especially when Willy's watching.
Which is why, they call it yard juice.
Next question.
Do you get to pick your number?
Does anyone ever get their head stuck between the bars?
We call it getting metal ears.
Oh, hi, Mr. Winger!
Thought we'd sneak in a little learning for the movie.
Well, there's no movie today.
So everyone roll to your seat areas.
Yes sir.
So, law.
Law is, simply put,
an agreement we all make
to do our best to stay out of each others way.
Is there a more technical definition, Mr. Winger?
Well, I wouldn't know, Willy.
I don't cotton much to fancy words and book study.
It's not how I got to where I am.
How did you get to be where you are, Mr. Winger?
Where were you born?
Mr. Winger was born in dirt, Willy.
Same as you, I'm sure.
And I had my face held down in that dirt by the kings of dirt.
And now, they're still there, ruling over dirt,
and I got out.
By talking, by lying.
Well, in case you hadn't noticed, it seems to beat being a bully.
Garrett?
Mr. Winger when did you stop being funny?
I mean, am I wrong?
Or is he really intense here?
Everyone's so charmed by him because he's a violent criminal.
But he's also a petty sociopath,
and the more I try to point that out, the pettier I look.
You the one who championed this program
shouldn't have worn that petard
if you didn't wanna be hoisted by it.
What do you think the expression
hoisted by your own petard is referencing?
I guess I just assumed that
in the old days a patard was a special outfit
like a leatard, with a lot of fancy buckles and loops on it,
and that rich people would wear them
when they were feeling especially smug.
But then poor people could tie a rope to one of the loops,
and hoist them up a pole
and then let them dangle there as punishment for being cocky.
Never look it up,
your explanation is way better,
but also the next time a friend comes by with their problems,
maybe lay off the I told you sos.
Jeff, we're having a Britta party here,
could you be a little bit less of a buzz kill?
That was great.
Now party like there's no tomorrow.
What?
There's no tomorrow.
Party like it.
Okay.
Why don't you just do some business in the background for now?
Hi, everybody.
Don't worry we're not here to bust up your party,
I know most of you are like 30.
We're here because Frankie Dart has exciting news.
You have all been very cooperative
with this inmate education program.
The Department of Corrections is very, very happy.
Which means, Greendale is gonna be rich.
Don't tell anybody,
but we smuggled in a few guests
to the party to celebrate with us.
Did someone order a prison break?
Plenty of convicts to go around.
Hey, okay!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Take him to the dance floor.
Cheers.
Pass him around.
Pass, that's Willy, pass him, yeah!
Pass Willy, pass me Willy.
You go Willy.
Keep doing that.
Keep doing that.
Try dancing harder.
Is that as hard as you can dance?
You're at a party. You're celebrating.
Abed, it's six in the morning.
Okay. Thanks.
Do you think you've gotten enough shots?
Nobody's partied like there's no tomorrow yet.
They keep dancing like it's today.
That's okay.
Are you joking?
This is the reason I signed on to this film,
I think it's a performance issue.
I think this needed some real actors.
Well, lesson learned.
Yeah.
Okay. From the top!
And action!
What?
Who are these people?
Go, go, go!
Good, Dean.
Good, Francine.
Party.
Party, no tomorrow guys, come on.
Hey Mr. Winger, you know I was thinking for class today,
maybe you could... Hey, what's going on?
Hey, careful now, put me down!
Well, Willy.
Look at me!
I'm a murderer!
Can I be as cool as you now?
Willy?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Willy, talk to me!
Talk to me!
I can't see anything.
Willy. Willy.
Focus on my voice.
Hey I, I, I'm losing you.
You're not losing me!
You are going to a better place with a stronger signal!
Willy?
Willy?
Willy?
What's going on here?
He started it.
Jeffrey.
You are on sabbatical.
You can't do that.
Yes, I can.
Two weeks paid sabbatical!
Get him out of here.
He's banned from the campus.
You are on sabbatical!
You're on sabbatical, sir.
Yeah, I'll go on my own with dignity.
Something you should look up.
I can't look it up, you destroyed my device!
And my heart!
You destroyed his device and his heart, sir.
Yeah, I'm going.
Willy, Willy.
Oh, sorry I'm late, I had to find a parking spot for my house.
Oh, must be so cool living in a vehicle.
Wait, where's your poop go?
A tank.
Gross.
Get a house.
Ben, aren't you homeless?
Yeah, but I poop in a house.
Whose?
Nice try.
Annie.
Britta.
How's your movie coming?
Amazing.
Abed's a genius.
He's actually having a hard time deciding what to cut,
so it's going to be in two volumes.
And it's hard to sleep, but it's worth it,
because it's a movie about a party.
Would you like my help?
Yes.
Have you learned anything?
Don't question rules. Rules are good,
I'm bad, all hail Annie.
Thank you.
Damn.
Oh, nice of you to show up.
We moved here for you.
I didn't ask for this,
have your meeting at school without me. I don't care.
Dean's using the study room for the ceremony.
Wha, the, ceremony?
You don't know?
The Dean's making that convict he murdered into a professor.
What?
Why do you care?
Because the Dean is just doing this to prove something,
and it's really stupid.
The guy's dangerous and he's manipulating him.
Isn't that what you usually do?
No, I mean, yes, but not like that.
I lied to the Dean for personal gain.
I wouldn't use him emotionally.
I wouldn't mislead him.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Have you ever thought of saying that to the Dean?
Jeff, go to him.
Going to him.
Wait, that's the whole point.
I can't go to him, I can't get on campus.
And yet murderers can.
What have I done?
Murderers can get on campus.
I'll need a broom, a remote control car,
an iPad, and an elaborate
gyroscopically stabilized servo motor.
Dude, we're trying to help Jeff here,
you're acting kinda spoiled right now.
Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, party, party, party, party.
Cut!
Abed, Britta has something to say.
My script is misleading.
It's impossible to party like there's no tomorrow.
But it's based on a true.
It's based on my desire to have a party.
Parties are just booze,
low lights and loud music
so people can feel more, see less,
and not have to listen to each other or themselves.
That's stupid.
Parties are stupid.
I'm stupid, you're shooting a stupid movie.
That's a wrap.
Go on, we're done here.
What's gonna happen to me?
You are going to punished,
in ways you won't understand
for longer than you think is rational or possible.
But then one day,
you'll do something he likes, and he'll stop.
And eventually you'll either adapt or lose your mind.
Okay.
Girls.
Girls.
As a prison warden I know all too well
how rare stories of true rehabilitation can be,
but this Dean and this prisoner stand here together today
to prove that the dream is real.
I'm here for the ceremony.
Last name?
Gellar, prisoner ID 042098.
Okay, go on.
Hi, I'm here for the ceremony.
Have a nice night, sir.
Dean Craig Pelton.
Do you accept responsibility
for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?
I do.
Willy Seibert Smith,
do you accept that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery
for everyone but convicts,
and that we have no choice but to pay you $0.13 per hour or less?
I do.
Then let us make official this symbolic union.
Hold it!
Dean, I agree there's no reason
you shouldn't give this guy my job.
Save it Jeffrey, I don't wanna hear it.
Don't do it before I tell you some things
that I've been getting away with not saying.
Someone get this maniac out of here.
Quite Willy.
Let's do this by prison rules.
Say what you have to say.
Dean, I like my job,
I don't mind coming to work here.
I feel kind of guilty when I pretend to be sick,
and I try to steal as little as possible,
just the basics, pens, coffee filters, toilet paper,
and one time an overhead projector and a roll of carpet.
But I don't lead you on, and I never will.
Because I'm not just a pretty face that murders people
and tells you what you wanna hear.
I'm less than that.
I'm a gorgeous face, that works for you,
and considers you a friend.
Oh, Jeffrey.
Okay, that, now, to be fair.
You guys know Will is an innocent man, right?
You shut your mouth, Warden.
No, it's true.
His appeal is in motion, there's new DNA evidence,
he's a good fella, wrongfully convicted.
You're not a murderer?
I can explain.
Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen.
Son of a bitch!
What?
Wait, let's do this by community college rules.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Go, broom.
Go!
Bring it on!
It's so violent.
Party like a girl.
Is this what you got?
Here's what I got.
Come on, let's do it!
Jeffrey!
He's down.
Now, who's fallen?
Hey, Willy.
Thanks, Dean.
Dean.
Dean.
Oh come on.
No, no.
No, no.
Way to go Mr. Winger!
Way to go!
Everybody, I am not participating in this.
The hell kinda school is this?
Okay, thanks for coming on short notice.
Is everyone here?
Think so, it's hard to tell without side cameras.
Wait, why am I moving?
Is my custom background working?
Wait, I can't.
It's WASD the move, it's been the same
since the invention of the keyboard.
Okay, nerd.
As you've heard, the rehabilitation program has been aborted,
so we lost that money,
but we no longer have to build 67 ramps,
so we should break-even.
Can you all hear that?
There's a kid outside throwing tennis balls against my RV.
I think I coffee shop corporate thieves.
Was it really necessary for us to use these things for this meeting?
Yeah, I think there's something wrong with mine.
I'll get a better connection.
It wasn't entirely necessary,
but the prison is selling these units at a discount,
so I thought I'd run their offer by the school.
What are you doing?
Get out! Mine's broken.
No, it's not.
Bad connect.
There's a janitor on it right now.
Terrib...Call others...
I think Britta's being arrested.
I have every right to be here.
You think, scared of you, but not.
All right. That's it.
Do you know how much windows cost?
Get off my lap!
Stop fighting technology.
I vote yes.
We should get these. They're cool.
I vote no.
People shouldn't have to be everywhere at once.
Sometimes, we need to do our own thing.
Chang, where are you?
I'm doing my own thing.
Why is there tile behind you?
Please tell me you're not doing the thing, I think you're doing.
Yeah.
That's the same towel we have in our apartment's bathroom.
What? Chang?
I gotta go.
Oh my God.
Yeah, I gotta go, too.
Jeffrey.
I take it we're passing on their offer.
No. Their just amateurs.
Initiating override protocol.
All in favor of this purchase.
Affirmative.
Very well.
Abedit's, commence with world domination.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate. Eradicate. Eradicate.
Did you get any of that?
