When you become an intern,
there's a ceremony where you get your white coat.
Like magic...
You're a doctor.
My parents came to my white coat ceremony.
I can still picture them, so happy...
so proud.
Hey, we need to get the board together, and...
Congratulations.
They say your life flashes before your eyes
right before you die.
The important moments.
The moments that tested you.
The moments that made you who you are.
April, you're getting married.
Unless I'm not.
I just heard.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I don't know about my life flashing before me.
I was thinking about my white coat...
And how I'm glad I have it on me now.
Um, will you overhead page Richard Webber for me?
Right away.
It's the moment my life started.
Seems fitting it should be on me when it ends.
Dr. Richard Webber,
Please call the E.R.
Dr. Richard Webber, please call the E.R.
Oh, baby's sleepin'.
Okay, we should get started.
Um, Bailey, we have some board business that we need to disc--
I'm not going anywhere.
Me and this baby got Bailey business to discuss.
Yes, we do.
Oh, she wants to take him to day care for show and tell.
Where's Richard?
I paged all the board members.
Yeah, well, he was being a hero last night.
He dislocated his shoulder saving a kid from the bus crash.
What bus crash?
She had a baby. She doesn't know things.
So tell me.
A church was evacuating some people,
and their bus overturned.
Good news is, everyone survived,
and there are no major injuries.
And the bad news?
Everything else.
The blood bank is flooded,
and the E.R. looks like it was ransacked.
So we need to close the E.R.?
We're dangerously low on meds.
Personnel can't make it in due to the flooding.
Can we do that? But can we do that?
You are the board.
I am telling you that E.R. cannot open today.
What do we need?
I mean, I can try to coordinate with our suppliers.
I had a baby. I'm not dead.
If they have it, then we want it.
In the meantime, let's make sure
that our inpatients are taken care of and discharge who we can.
Like me.
No, you just had a major abdominal surgery.
You're gonna stay right here.
All right, airport's just reopened.
I just put Dr. Boswell in a cab.
Who's Dr. Boswell?
She's the woman Arizona slept with last night.
What are you doing? We're closed to incoming traumas, guys.
Tell that to them.
There was a mudslide near Madrona.
A bunch of cops and firefighters got hurt doing evacuations.
There are also a bunch of civilian casualties as well.
What about seattle pres?
They're worse off than we are.
All right, let's do it. Help me get this sling off.
Get me every suture kit, laceration tray,
Foley, and chest tube that you can.
We're gonna come down. We're sending a triage down.
What?
My shift is over. I was gonna go home and go to sleep.
I'm so tired and hungry.
My teeth have stuff growing on them, and...
Can you pretend you didn't hear any of that?
Yep.
Yeah, yeah.
Coming through. Straight ahead.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait.
Okay, I'm not doing it in an on call room.
I'm a grown-up with a house.
Your house has a tree in the middle of it.
Wait, wait. Did you have sex with Leah in here?
And Heather?
Oh, god. I don't think I can do this.
Yeah, I can.
No. No, no, no.
I need this.
We're here. We're ready. Let's just do it. Two minutes.
No one's gonna die if we don't answer our pagers
for two minutes, right?
Right.
Crap! Now I'm thinking about dead people.
Unconscious at the scene with a G.C.S. of 13.
B.P.'s been constantly dropping.
Last was 85 over 60.
I can't... get... a good... breath.
Increase his O2 to 10 liters.
Can you tell me if anything fell on you, on your chest?
I don't know.
Last thing I remember, helping the old lady out of her house.
Did sh-she make it?
I'll check.
5818 Shore Drive. And my guys--
I-I got 12 guys out there.
Turn him. Turn him!
Okay, looks like he aspirated mud.
Let's get him into trauma room one.
Let's get a chest X-ray and start him on antibiotics.
Let's go!
Go. Coming through!
Owen and I...
Oh, you know, I don't even know what to call it.
Ended it? Broke up?
I feel like I'm gonna die.
You always end it, and then you start it again.
Yeah, but this is different.
Okay.
Oh, I'm gonna go to sleep.
Oh, just for, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, Robbins cheating on Callie?
I know.
And "Bailey" is a good name.
But two Baileys? You don't think it's gonna be confusing?
No, because... if I say, "Bailey peed on me,"
I think it's safe to assume that I'm talking about my son.
Very good. Seriously, wake me in 20?
Okay.
Thank you.
I feel like I'm gonna die.
Shepherd?
Yeah, Lydia Ashford. Injuries to the upper extremities.
My house.
And she's worried about her house.
Wait. Uh, 5818 Shore Drive?
Yes. Is it gone?
I don't know.
Uh, Karev, Kepner's in Trauma One.
Get her to tell her patient 5818 Shore Drive made it.
Kepner!
Tell your guy 5818 is out.
I could've done that.
I'm sorry, but I need a neuro consult in Bay 7.
The guy's unconscious, but he's stable.
Look what I found in outpatient surgery.
Ross, stay here. I paged Brooks.
Have her get Mrs. Ashford a pan scan
of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen.
Well, I can take her.
No, have Brooks do it.
Uh, the mayor's on the phone,
wants to know about casualties from the mudslide.
I told him it was soon to tell,
but he wants to hear it from you.
Hey, um, go find Dr. Webber.
I'm supposed to give Dr. Brooks a message from Dr. Shepherd.
Uh, is that life-threatening?
Because not having enough general surgeons
in here right now is life-threatening.
Go find Webber.
Have you seen Dr. Webber?
Uh, last time I saw him was after surgery.
He went to go check on the generator.
Where's that?
How the hell should I know?
Lidocaine and a bunch of 4X4s.
Can you take that to Hunt? I got paged by Shepherd.
Uh... he wants you to go find Webber.
Are you sure? He just paged me 9-1-2.
That's our special little code.
It means more emergent than 9-1-1. Get it?
All I know is they need Webber here,
and Shepherd wants you to get him.
Apparently, he went to deal with the generator.
And I'm walking toward the car,
and suddenly the hillside just goes...
and I'm falling.
I see my squad car coming down on top of me,
so I managed to roll out of the way,
but my... my leg was caught under it.
Can you salvage it?
I think so. We'll get ortho down here.
I'm gonna take a look
at that nasty laceration on your neck, though.
It's a lot of embedded debris.
Hey, Tilden? Everyone make it out of the mud?
Everyone's accounted for except Lauenstein,
Phil G, and Brian.
Brian's my fiance?
Don't worry. You know him. He's gonna be fine.
Look, he's probably giving himself a mud facial.
You know, look good for the wedding.
Yeah, well, if he had cold feet,
he shoulda just said so.
Dr. Webber?
Dr. Webber!
Oh, crap. Dr. Webber!
第十季 第一&二集
Oscar Hallis.
Shepherd says he's probably concussed.
We're gonna do a head C.T.
I'm more concerned about infection.
That is a nasty cut on his leg.
Well, Dr. Wilson's irrigating it with saline.
But we couldn't find any bacitracin,
we're gonna hang some ampicillin.
No ampicillin! He's allergic to penicillin.
How do you know?
What the hell?
Military trick.
Someone triaged him at the scene--
probably whoever dug him out.
Substitute cefazolin and keep a close eye for allergic reaction.
All right. Get some cefazolin.
We don't have it.
Well, find it.
Someone at the scene knew what they were doing.
Might've just saved this guy's life.
Oh. Sharpie here, too.
And it indicates he's getting worse fast.
His B.P. was better in the field. Crap.
Okay, we need to stabilize his pelvis.
Okay, you're gonna need to pull harder.
Talk to me, Murphy.
C.T. showed an open book pelvic fracture
on a liver lac with hemorrhage.
Harder, Murphy.
I'm afraid if I pull too hard, I'm gonna make it worse.
You can't--move. Can't make it worse.
It's already as bad as it can be.
All right, I need to get this guy upstairs
and put on an ex fix immediately.
Murphy, book an O.R.
and ask Bailey to scrub in.
What do you need Bailey for?
He has a liver lac. I need a general surgeon.
Well, I'm a general surgeon, and it's all hands on deck--
Get me Bailey!
Do you have cefazolin?
Yeah, they were hoarding it in O.B.
Bastards. Give me some.
Ahh! I'll trade you for a chest tube.
And a granola bar.
I don't have a granola bar.
Liar.
You've got granola bar breath.
Do you want the cef?
Fine! Yeah.
What is going on out there?
Huge mudslide. Gotta go.
Lot of crush injuries. Super cute baby.
I thought the E.R. was closed!
Where's Brooks?
Uh, she was busy, so I went ahead and did the scan.
It shows a small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Her exam?
Uh, neuro checks have been stable.
All right, tell Brooks I want her to continue on
with q 1 hour neuro checks.
But--
Don't argue with me. Just find Brooks.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Ashford, how are you feeling?
My house.
5818.
Crown molding in every room.
All right, right now I'm worried about you.
Your fingers are crushed. I need an ortho consult, please.
On it.
Okay, I need you to look up here for me.
Crown molding in every room.
Okay. How's he doing?
Captain Shulte has decreased breath sounds on the right,
worsening tachypnea and persistent SATs in the 80s.
Took me forever to find a chest tube.
I need a-a list.
Who--who's still missing?
Okay, Lenny, something in your chest cavity's
preventing you from breathing well,
so we're gonna insert a chest tube
which should help you breathe better.
Is there anyone that we can call for you?
Mm. Call... call Marla, but...
don't--don't let her come up here. Road's not safe.
Guys, you're gonna need to go.
All right.
Okay. Come on. Hang in there, Lenny.
Okay, you're gonna feel a little snip. Here you go.
Got a chest tube.
Too late. Already got one.
Okay, uh, let me help.
Oh! Oh, god, oh, god, it's poop! Oh!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
The tube is in a good position.
I suspect a diaphragmatic rupture.
Lenny, Lenny, I believe your colon has been pushed up into your chest.
Now the risk of infection is extremely high.
Now if I'm right, we're gonna need to open you up.
All right?
Give me the chart, please.
Here you go, doctor.
All right, let's get an x-ray and prep him for surgery.
I'll scrub in with you. Call Bailey.
Ask her to man the E.R., please.
Go.
Dr. Bailey, um...
You smell like feces.
Uh, I know.
So why you standing next to me if you smell like feces?
Dr. Hunt would like you to take over in the E.R.
while he goes up to surgery.
Tell Dr. Hunt I'm about to go in with... Torres
on this gentleman's broken pelvis,
so I can't man the E.R. Where's Dr. Webber?
I don't know.
Okay, well, find him, pl--
Someone needs to find Richard Webber!
Coming through!
Webber's pulse is thready.
Systolic's 80.
Brooks has massive head trauma.
Pupils are unresponsive.
Let's get her on her side.
Ready? Move over here. 1, 2, 3, go.
Get her for a C.T. Ross?
Ross! Let's go. Go!
V tach. Um, give me one of EPI.
Come on. Come on.
Charge to 120.
Got it.
Clear.
Okay, charge to 200. Clear.
Charge to 200.
Clear.
I know you guys are freaked out,
but we have patients, so you need to focus.
Figure out who Ross and Brooks were covering.
Uh, Ross was doing neuro checks on Crown Molding...
No breath sounds.
So I can take over those.
Allergic guy is awake,
and his head C.T. came back clear.
Last time I checked his B.P., it was good, like, uh,
like... 115 over... 70.
I wrote it down somewhere.
What the hell?
Well, the electronic charts are still down,
So I'm winging it. Crap.
I know I have it.
Let's charge him again.
Clear!
Give him another EPI.
Come on.
Oscar, I'm Dr. Karev.
Glad you're awake. Your head C.T. is clear,
And we're gonna have plastics sew up your leg.
Awesome.
All right. B.P. Looks good. 115 over 85.
Our electronic charts are down.
Hope you don't mind a temporary tattoo.
Go for it, doc.
I already got one.
Look, I know Heather's a friend,
And if you need more time, I can--
No. I'm... I'm fine.
Good. Go help prep the patient.
I know that you wanted Bailey, but she's working on Richard.
Callie, we should--
Should what?
Not sleep with other people? Respect our wedding vows?
We should put our problems aside right now,
because this guy deserves that.
Well, thank god you found them, Ross.
Let's just hope you found them in time.
Damn it. Subdural.
Oh, god.
Let's go.
Lines in.
Swan, please.
Okay, let's hook him back up.
Labs.
Okay, uh, troponin?
Elevated at 4.
Hmm. Crit?
Fine at 40.
Potassium's 4.5. Bicarb 18.
Everything else is normal.
Lactate.
2.
No, that--that can't be right. He should be acidotic.
His girth is increasing as we stand here.
Look, it says--
I know what it says, but it's wrong.
Redo it.
All right, uh, charge again to 200.
Clear.
Karev? What's going on with Richard?
Uh, echo shows very little heart activity,
and C.V.P.'s elevated.
Yang's about to set up for a balloon pump.
All right, well, if we're sending him up to surgery,
let's make sure we have an adequate blood supply for transfusion.
On it.
If--if you need to go deal with more dire patients,
I get it. Go. I'm fine.
Actually, you're not, Sasha. It's important that
we go ahead and debde and clean out this wound
as soon as possible to prevent infection.
Sasha... are you supposed to be walking around in that thing?
I can't sit still.
I'm waiting on plastic surgery to sew me up.
That's this guy.
You mind if I, uh, if I sit here?
That kinda looks like Brian's handwriting.
Yeah, I know. My glasses got knocked off in the slide.
I could barely see a thing, but it could've been.
But was it his voice?
I can't remember. I'm sorry, Sash.
I was kinda out of it, you know?
I'm sorry.
Just a little discoloration in the tissue.
I'd like to run a few tests
just to make sure there's nothing to worry about.
I'm just gonna numb you up, okay?
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'm telling you, that's his writing.
We need blood, Mer. There's no time to screen, type, or cross.
All right? I need all the o-neg I can get.
Okay, but wait. Tell me what's going on?
And staff. Lab techs, scrub nurses.
I need E.T.A.S on when you can get people in here.
Page me when you can.
Alex, pick up the baby.
Mer, I don't have time.
Alex. Pick up my baby.
No, the baby is for you,
so that you can stop freaking out.
Now just relax and tell me what's going on.
Webber and Brooks are down. They were electrocuted.
It's bad, but we're--we're-- we're--we're dealing with it.
I just need you to get on the phone
And help us get those supplies, okay?
Okay. Okay.
Here.
Your turn not to freak out.
Okay, forceps.
Metz.
I have a status update on Dr. Webber.
Okay.
Dr. Yang is attempting to place a balloon pump,
but he keeps coding.
She's placing one bedside without fluoro?
She could rupture his aorta.
Do you want me to get Dr. Yang on the phone?
You just said she's threading a balloon pump.
She is, but...
Then how is she gonna talk on the phone?
I didn't... mean...
Retract her.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Okay, let's run the bowel.
The abdomen's fully contaminated.
Just run the bowel.
We're gonna resect this and get out of here.
Let's get ready to pack him.
Come on, Lenny.
It's too quiet.
Talk.
Y-you're doing good.
You... are not going to rupture the aorta
because you... are Cristina Yang.
Attach this to the console.
You are the star of your class.
I always knew it. I said it to anyone who'd ask--
"Look out for Cristina Yang." I-I said it to Webber.
"Cristina Yang is good."
"Cristina Yang would not rupture an aorta."
"Cristina Ya--"
Oh, god, you did it.
Oh, dear lord. He has a steady heartbeat.
Oh, praise Jesus. You didn't rupture his aorta.
Secure this device and get him up to the I.C.U.
We just bought him some time.
Hug me back, Cristina Yang.
I know you are not a hugger,
but right now I need you to hug me back.
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.
Did you find out?
Press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet.
Find out what?
About my house.
It has the most beautiful crown moldings.
Now with your hands.
I'm sorry. I haven't had time to ask about your house.
How's your vision?
Any blurriness?
My vision?
I don't care about my--
S-stop.
Stop this nonsense.
Just call somebody, please. Find out about my house.
Ma'am, this isn't nonsense.
I'm trying to help you, and I have about 20 other patients,
so checking on your house is the last thing
on my mind right now.
People got injured badly,
so you need to stop worrying about your house,
and you need to tell me if you are experiencing
any blurriness of vision.
His lactate is 6.
6?
Uh, he has an acute abdomen. Get me an O.R. and a good staff.
I'll take, uh, Linda, if she's available. Norman.
Are you out of your mind?
Norman's M.I.A.
Okay, Anna, then.
I'll make some phone calls.
You're not opening him up.
The electrical injury
may have caused intra-abdominal tissue damage
and likely progressing because of his heart failing.
He barely tolerated the balloon pump.
I need to get in there and debride the dead tissue.
There's no way his heart can handle the anesthesia.
His lactate is 6.
He needs sustained cardiac I.C.U.
He's gonna die if we don't do anything.
We're not doing nothing.
We're gonna let the balloon pump work..
I am the attending...
And keep his fluids tight.
You are a fellow. I make the decisions here.
Well, I own this hospital. You work for me.
He's bleeding through the packing,
and there's still stool coming out.
Damn it. We need to take it out and resect more intestines.
How's his I.N.R.?
The last one was 6.
Okay, give him factor VII, F.F.P.S and platelets.
Faster, Kepner.
He's having arrhythmias.
Talk to me.
Uh... I can't get a pulse.
I think he's in P.E.A.
Starting compressions.
I know this is difficult,
but Brooks is our patient.
I'm telling you this to remind you to be her doctor,
not her friend right now.
There are decisions to be made in there
that will affect not only her ability to be a surgeon...
her speech, her ability to function, her life.
But those decisions are ultimately mine.
I will not make them lightly.
But I will make them quickly,
and you need to do exactly as I say. No questions.
Can you do that?
I think so.
That's not good enough.
Yes, sir. I-I can do it, sir.
I'll take this to the labs,
and Dr. Avery will let you know the results.
Thank you.
Hey. Heard you were looking for this guy.
Brian!
I was so worried. Get over here and give me a kiss, you jerk.
Baby, I'm all muddy.
I don't care.
Are you okay?
Mmm. I knew that was your handwriting.
What are you talking about?
On Oscar.
Didn't you pull him out?
No.
Someone triaged a bunch of guys at the scene
and wrote vitals down with a sharpie.
Yeah, I wish that was me.
I was just sitting in an air pocket,
twiddling my thumbs.
Uh, I actually think I'm having some trouble moving.
I think I broke some ribs.
Let's get those checked out.
Yeah.
Um, I heard Lenny was in surgery. How's he doing?
I don't know.
P.H. is down to 7.12.
Come on, Lenny.
He's been down 20 minutes.
Did you say "Yes"?
Sir?
To Matthew.
I helped with his proposal.
Oh, uh, yeah. Yes. I said "Yes."
Good.
I like him. He's a good guy.
I mean, these guys--
These first responders-- they're all good guys.
Hate to give up.
Damn it, Lenny.
Time of death--1556.
It's Dr. Karev. The firefighters are asking for an update.
Chaplain's on his way to tell Marla and the girls.
She's gonna wanna come in
and see him.
Absolutely.
Let's bring her in. Full lights and sirens.
On it.
Lauenstein's still missing.
We gotta bring him back. We gotta do that for lenny.
If I could walk, I'd be out on that pile.
Excuse me.
Kelly clamp.
Suction.
Guys, he's almost lost his entire blood volume.
If you don't get control up there--
it's already done.
I controlled the bleeding using a pringle maneuver.
Wow. Cool.
Don't be so impressed. It's fairly standard.
Yeah, I know, but you did it so well.
I was wrong before, Murphy,
When I implied that Dr. Robbins wasn't a real general surgeon.
She is. She's an excellent general surgeon.
It's okay. We've all said things that we shouldn't have.
Oh, Owen.
Owen, no. You're not gonna "Owen" this.
No personal relationships. This is professional.
This is Dr. Hunt.
What is going on?
Dr. Webber has an acute abdomen.
He needs surgery.
He barely survived the balloon pump.
His lactate is 6...
and holding.
So what if it's holding? Something is dead inside of him.
It's not gonna get undead.
It is way too risky, and you know it.
I would rather take the risk
than just wait for what we know is gonna kill him.
Stop, stop. What does his healthcare directive say
about extraordinary measures?
Whoa. I smell dead people.
Oh, and spiders. Dead people killed by spiders.
Okay, let's find his personnel file.
Oh! Okay, I, uh, got it.
"Webber."
Oh, no.
What, he doesn't have a healthcare directive?
No. He has one.
I don't understand.
Richard designated you as his medical power of attorney.
But he can't make me next of kin
without talking to me first.
He did.
After Adele died, he revised his directive.
But--
Meredith, I know this is a shock,
but we don't have much time.
Right now you need to make a decision.
His heart is too weak, Meredith.
His heart can take it.
You trust me, right? You named your baby after me.
Hey, hey!
No personal relationships.
The amount of electricity he had in his body
should have killed him instantly,
But it didn't, which tells me that the heart damage
isn't as bad as you think.
He coded four times.
And we got him back!
Oh, and now you just sound idiotic.
Ah-ah! Dr. Yang!
No, seriously. You sound like a family member
who googled "Electrocution"
and is trying to remain optimistic.
Well, I am optimistic.
Well, Richard should have made Bailey his family member,
because that is how she's acting right now.
I wish he would've.
Well, he didn't. He put Meredith down.
Why would he do that?
And she knows as well as I do that electric shock
can cause death of tissues which could start a whole
inflammatory cascade unless I debride what's been damaged.
Well, he'll have to handle it for a day to let his heart rest.
And then...
He can't handle it?
Okay, now you sound like an idiot.
Letting that tissue die is like taking a gun
and killing him.
Why wouldn't he tell me?
I don't know, but he didn't.
And it's on you, so you have to decide, Mer.
Yes. Meredith, please.
Damn it.
Just damn it.
It's massive. But...
we can just evacuate it, right?
It doesn't change our plan.
Do what we can and hope for the best.
Can you see her vital signs?
Yeah. Bad.
At least Shane's happy.
Heather's out of the competition.
That was mean... even for you.
It was a joke. I'm trying to lighten the mood.
Our friend is dying.
You don't even like her.
Oh, my god.
Just ignore her, Steph.
Well, she usually does.
We should get back.
I like heather.
I know.
You know what I was thinking before you guys came in here?
I was thinking I wish my mother were here
to see my kids.
I was wondering if she'd make a good grandmother.
But you know what that is?
That's delusional thinking.
Because my mother would make a horrible grandmother,
because she was a horrible mother.
So... I'm delusional and hormonal.
And I can't trust my delusional thoughts.
I have to rely on the labs.
So we need to run the lactate again,
and if it's above 6, we're going to do the surgery.
And if it's not, we're not.
Hey, where's Brian?
Who's Brian?
Bed three.
Broken ribs.
Dead fianc.
Oh! Him. Mm-hmm.
Um, he left. One of his friends is still missing.
All right. Uh, listen up, guys.
You wanna do something for your friends that are hurt?
Sure.
How about donating some blood?
We can do that.
All right, just line up behind these doctors,
and they're gonna help you out.
That way, they're tied to the table and they can't take off.
I'll give some blood.
I'll help the blood bank staff get set up.
Were you out at the pile?
Yeah.
Do you know if 5818 Shore Drive is still standing?
It's my patient's house, and she's worried.
Sharpie lady's here?
Sharpie lady?
I was evacuating her when the mudslide happened,
and she runs back in her house.
I lose it on her, 'cause I'm thinking
she's looking for her wallet or something,
and I'm like,
"Lady, that crap can be replaced."
And she comes running out with a sharpie
and immediately starts digging guys out
and taking their vitals.
That's why her fingers are crushed.
I feel kinda bad for yelling at her.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Crown molding's a badass.
I was just thinking about
when Richard caught me living in the limb room.
I was a resident.
Before George. Anyway...
I was in there one night,
and he--Richard walked in on me dancing in my underwear.
I was so embarrassed.
I mean... he was the chief.
Are you okay?
No. No, I'm...
No, I don't dance in my underwear anymore.
Lactate's 9.
Go.
You agree with Meredith's decision?
I think it was a coin toss.
You gonna be in there with Bailey?
Yeah.
Okay, if he has abnormal bleeding,
give him factor VII.
He responds to it well.
Okay.
And make sure his pulses are checked hourly.
That is really important. You wanna write that down?
No, I think I...
You know, let me put that in your phone.
You're a challenging person.
I know.
The swelling is bad.
Shepherd's had to open up a bigger chunk of her skull.
There's no way she's getting out of this without major deficits.
What are you doing?
Heather's hemorrhaging.
Yeah, I heard.
She could die.
All right, look, don't go there.
She's my age, my class.
Her locker's right next to mine.
I used her deodorant without telling her,
and she could die.
I know. It sucks.
It all sucks.
Mm. Wait, wait. This is bad. We shouldn't.
Yeah.
But I want to.
Okay.
Wait.
Did you have sex with any of my friends in this closet?
Okay. No. This isn't happening.
I gotta go.
I was just gonna get some lidocaine,
but I'm not gonna slip on a used condom, am I?
Screw you.
Did you hear the news about me being a big slut got out?
Yeah.
It's mortifying.
But, you know, I mean, I think that--
I think that we're gonna be okay.
You know, I-I think--I think it's gonna make us stronger.
You know, like a bone.
You know, sometimes you-- you have to--
you have to break it in order for it to heal correctly.
And I think that maybe Callie and I...
That's what I was gonna tell Callie.
Like, um, an ortho metaphor?
What do you think?
I think you should stick to
"I'm sorry I'm such a slut."
Yeah. Good call.
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.
You wanna press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet?
I heard you're kind of a hero.
Oh, my god.
Mrs. Ashford.
I could use some help over here!
You're gonna be good, Dougie,
okay? You're gonna be fine.
Douglas Lauenstein, multiple crush injuries,
B.P. 105 over 72.
Get him up to trauma 3. Hey, where do you think you're going?
Sash, we got him.
He was still in the rig.
Is he gonna be okay?
Yeah, he's gonna be okay, but I gotta head back out.
We're trying to stabilize the area,
make sure we don't lose any more houses.
You're not going anywhere. You're still bleeding.
Well, just patch me up.
No, I already did that.
Well, maybe this guy can help.
All right, Sasha, we just got your studies back,
and this is necrotizing fasciitis.
It is aggressive,
and we need to get you up to surgery right away.
How--how did I--
Uh, the water and the mud that you were stuck in.
Both of those are breeding grounds for this type
of bacteria.
Well, wait--
It's a flesh-eating bacteria, Brian, all right?
What's most important is that
we get her prepped and ready right away. Let's go.
A doctor puts on his white coat to save lives,
defy death, but once he takes it off,
he's vulnerable,
just like anybody else.
Human.
Ma'am...
I'm Dr. Kepner.
I worked on your husband.
Would you like to see him?
Okay.
We're all gonna die.
We don't get much say over how or when.
His ring.
Thought you'd want it back.
I'm so, so sorry.
But we do get to decide how we're gonna live.
So do it.
Decide.
Is this the life you want to live?
Is this the person you want to love?
Is this the best you can be?
Can you be stronger?
Kinder?
Be a good friend.
Tell me I made the right decision.
More compassionate?
You made the right decision.
Oh, damn it. There's blood in the temporal horn.
I'm gonna have to do a temporal lobectomy.
Dr. Shepherd.
She'll have motor and memory deficits if you--
I'm trying to save her life.
This is my fault.
Shane.
No, I did this.
You didn't do anything. This is not your fault.
This just happened.
Now I can't have you in here if you can't hold it together.
Can you be in here?
Decide.
Yeah.
Dissectors.
Breathe in.
Tell me again.
Breathe out.
You made the right decision.
And decide.
10 blade.
The waiting can kill you.
You make a decision,
and then the world has to turn.
The consequences unfold...
out of your hands.
There's only one thing that seems clear...
in those quiet moments while you wait.
Whatever you chose was wrong.
You think he put you in his will?
No.
Next of kin.
Maybe you get the house.
I have a house.
Well, you can give me his house. I mean, I could use a house.
He's not my father.
I've been telling him this for years.
He just feels guilty
because he busted up my parents' marriage.
That's not my problem.
It is now.
Yeah, I mean, sticking me with his end of life care--
Doesn't ask, doesn't give me an out--
That's real love.
Well, it sounds like family to me.
Maybe he is your father. Banged your mom enough.
Alex.
Did they know each other before you were born?
They met when I was 3.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's what they told you.
I gotta get back to the E.R.
Ow. Oh, no, no. Let me get it.
This is Yang.
And how about Brooks?
I know. I'm fine.
Hey, look. I need to run to my nec fasc surgery.
He's in cardiogenic shock.
No.
Bailey feels like there's likely some internal necrosis.
So she took him up to the O.R.
With this kind of cardiac compromise?
Yeah--and she--
Unh-unh. She--mom. Mom?
Look...
I need Hunt in here.
I can try to--
Now!
Ready? Go. Two, three...
Bowels are completely clean.
Should we recheck the pelvis?
I have, four times.
What the hell do you think you're doing--
Cutting open a man in cardiogenic shock
with nothing on his C.T.?
There's dead tissue somewhere inside him.
I'd like to find it before it kills him.
He can't handle this stress
until his cardiac status is stabilized!
Get him off that table!
Lap pad, please.
Dr. Hunt!
Dr. Avery, I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down while we're doing our work.
Huh, there's a surprise for you.
Pressure's dropping. Is his dopamine maxed out?
Yeah, it's at 20.
Close the patient!
Come on. Where are you?
Dr. Hunt! Brooks is crashing.
Bailey, he's having runs of V-tach.
Close... him... up!
Closing.
Can you get by without me?
Just go.
Hey, how's it going with Brooks?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You gotta drink the juice, man.
You give us half your blood and head back to the pile,
you're gonna pass out.
Heather didn't make it.
Come on.
I'm gonna give the interns the rest of the night off.
Can you give me a hand if there's anything they drop?
Of course.
I'm so sorry about Heather.
Yeah.
Dr. Hunt, Lydia's desatting,
decreased breath sounds on the left.
Wha--
Sharpie lady.
Oh. Should I throw in a chest tube?
Dr. Yang is gonna take over that case.
Why? I can handle a chest tube.
Oh, my god.
I got a woman with necrotizing fasciitis,
and the interns aren't operating.
So can you--
Of course.
Well, she's already on the table,
and the anesthesiologists are lining her up.
Be ready in ten.
Okay. Hey...
It's just terrible.
Jackson.
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.
And what about Richard?
Still critical,
but his pressure stabilized once Bailey closed.
So Bailey closed because his vitals tanked,
or because Catherine Avery was in the gallery screaming?
Oh, Derek.
You heard about Brooks?
I can't believe it.
Can we have a conversation?
Not now.
I know you're mad.
And telling everyone-- I guess...
I deserved that.
But we could just--
I said not now.
Hey, it's right behind me!
Are you headed back out?
Be careful, okay?
It was Avery, right?
He's the guy that you...
I get it. He's a good-looking guy.
Practically runs the hospital.
Matthew--
And I proposed to you in front of a hundred people.
I didn't really give you the opportunity to say "No."
So...
Did you want to say "No"?
Callie?
Callie?
Callie?!
We got the clot out,
but there was just so much swelling.
Couldn't get it to stop.
Did you tell the family?
Yeah, I had someone call her mom when we found her
and tell her that she was injured.
She's coming down from someplace in Oregon.
I just didn't want to tell her
when she was still on the road.
Okay, so you need to go to the day care
and pick up Zola because she's gonna think
we had a baby and forgot about her.
I'll call the babysitter and tell her
to meet you at the house in an hour.
And you should tell the interns
to hang out and wait till Heather's mom arrives.
Give me the baby.
Okay.
I know.
That is a lot of blood.
Should I book an O.R.?
No, not yet.
We'll monitor her for the next couple of hours
and then decide.
My--my house.
Ma'am, you've lost quite a lot of blood.
You should rest.
I-I wouldn't worry about the house right now.
You can't scream at my doctors when there is
an open body on the table.
I can't believe you let her talk you into
a boondoggle like that.
Dr. Avery, if you have any issues with--
Does he know why you cut open a man in severe cardiac distress
just so you could poke around and see what's going on?
We looked at all of the options.
Tell him.
You tell him you feel guilty
because the last thing Richard Webber heard from you
is that he's a drunk who ruined your life,
after all he's done for you.
We talk on the phone for an hour every night.
It came up.
You feel bad, go find a priest.
But do not try to fix it with a Hail Mary.
That very well may kill the man!
I want acces to his charts... right now.
I'll be back in about an hour.
Heather's mother won't probably be here yet,
but if she is, uh, someone stay with her
until I get back.
We don't tell her, do we?
No, I will.
Just think of some good Heather stories.
Once she knows,
she's gonna want to know that she died among friends.
Who's gonna wait?
I can't. I can't. She'll see it in my face.
What the hell is his problem? It's not like they were friends.
I am not waiting with her alone.
I'm not either.
Okay. Nobody goes. We all wait.
Now go find Shane and tell him we're doing this together.
What are you, my mother? You find him.
Yes, yes, yes.
Hey.
Hey,can you watch her for a minute?
Yeah.
I need to get my laptop.
Come here.
What's going on?
My wife's an s-l-u-t.
Sofia and I are spending the night at a hotel.
And then what?
I don't know. Okay, I'll be right back.
We're gonna let her stay at a hotel?
So is this the woman
whose fiance is also a firefighter,
but they couldn't find him for a while?
Yep.
Forceps.
Wow, this wound is really deep.
To get good margins, we're gonna have to--
I got it.
You are one sleepy girl.
I'm gonna get you to bed right now.
I was gonna go to a hotel.
But Mer said I should come here.
Well, I guess I should have read those five text messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Sofia's asleep in Zola's bed--
And I-I can move her. She--
She probably won't wake up.
Yeah, okay.
Catherine may be right. I mean, it's possible
I'm too close to this to see it clearly.
Am I supposed to be seeing this clearly?
Well, Yang was advocating for a more conservative approach.
I guess that's what we go with.
Catherine's reviewing his chart--
labs, I don't know.
If she wants to make the decisions,
then maybe she should.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hey, how is she doing?
Well, I-I put in the chest tube.
One of her broken ribs sliced into her lung.
So, I mean, she put out a lot of blood.
We're watching her.
Okay.
How are you?
Fabulous.
Yeah.
What?
Nothing.
What?
I-I just...
I wish I had known it was gonna be
the last time you and I were together.
I would have done things a little differently.
Well, was the last time bad?
No, the last time was Wednesday,
when we knocked that plate off the counter,
and I spent half the night pulling shards of glass
out of your foot.
That was not the last time.
It was?
Not our best work.
Well, that's awful.
After the kind of run we had...
It's just a shame.
Shameful.
Everyone I love either cheats on me or dies.
Callie...
Or cheats on me and dies.
George did both.
Arizona's not gonna die.
Yeah, that doesn't make me feel any better.
Ugh. I'm sorry. I'm drinking all your wine.
You should be drinking all your wine
after what you went through tonight with Heather and...
and Richard, oh, my god!
Why is everything so horrible?
Please, it's okay. Go ahead.
It's all yours.
Okay.
I'll open another bottle.
Just page her!
I can't page someone 911 without the name of the patient--
Andrea.
When Dr. Torres calls in, she'll expect to know who--
No, there's no patient. Just page her.
We can't page 911 without a patient emergency.
Look at me. Does it look like this is not an emergency?
Hey, hey! What's going on?
What's going on?
I need you to page Callie 911.
Why?
Because she took off with my baby,
and I don't know where,
and when I call her, she doesn't pick up.
All right, did she...
No, just do it!
So we were able to remove all of the necrotic tissue,
but the labs suggest
that your organs are beginning to fail.
Well, is there anything that you can do?
Well, we're giving you some powerful antibiotics.
And we're hoping that that stops the process.
But...
but I might not make it.
We are going to do everything that we possibly can.
Bri...
We want to get married now.
Right now no matter what happens,
we want to be married.
We need a chaplain.
Hey, Bailey.
Arizona is in the lobby
screaming at nurses.
Why?
'Cause she has no idea where Callie is...
or the baby.
Oh, well, you need to tell her they're at my house.
Callie's not a battered woman.
We're not harboring her until she gets a restraining order.
She just wants some space.
But you don't think Arizona's called her,
like, 300 times?
If Callie wanted her to know where she was,
she'd have-- she'd have told her.
You think it's okay that Arizona
doesn't know where her baby is?
She's Sofia's mom, too.
They're both our friends.
You know, we shouldn't take sides.
It's not taking sides to tell Arizona where her kid is.
Oh, you think that's how it's gonna go?
What happened to your hair?
She wasn't funny funny, but she was weird funny.
We're not saying that to her mom.
Remember when she swallowed that marble?
We could talk about that.
Her mom knows she swallowed a marble, idiot.
You know what?
When you have a better idea, you let me know.
You were her roommate.
How do you not have a single nice story about her?
She took my white sweater and returned it pink.
She left the apartment without waking me up
when we both had rounds, which she knew about and said,
"I didn't want to bother you. You looked so peaceful."
She'd drink all the milk
and return the empty carton back in the fridge.
Then why are you all red-eyed and puffy?
We weren't soul mates.
It doesn't mean I wanted her dead.
What's going on with the baby?
Oh, nothing. He's fine.
They have him in the nursery.
Oh. Oh. I thought--
I thought something happened.
No, no.
I paged you because I wanted to let you know
that Callie and Sofia are going to stay at my place tonight.
I think she just needs some space.
She needs to cool off. And... I know
you're not gonna go run over there or anything,
but I just thought you would like to know
that she and the baby are--
Arizona.
Arizona?!
Is "I told you so" inappropriate?
Shut it.
Come on. What about... Hassan?
He's out at the pile, too?
You realize they can't all be out at the damn pile.
No, I don't care what religion they are.
Just give me somebody--anybody that can officiate this--
Yeah, as a member of the board, I'm gonna say
You want to stay away from phrases like,
"Even a Catholic."
All right, uh, just call me back.
How is Richard?
Hanging by a thread. Thank you very much.
You gonna scream at me, too, now?
I heard you already had a go at Hunt and Bailey.
I just wanna know what in god's name
was going on through your head--
Stop!
You are terrified. I get that.
You love him.
And you are as scared as you have ever been.
Marching through this hospital
telling everybody they are incompetent
is not gonna fix that situation.
We are all doing our best.
And we are gonna take good care of him.
And we... are gonna take good care of you.
Okay?
As soon as he's stable...
As soon as the storm passes,
I'm going to move him to another hospital.
I'm gonna do a thoracotomy on Lydia.
Just waiting for an O.R. to open up.
Okay.
So thanks for... before.
"Thanks"?
Are you gonna send a card on pretty stationery?
I'm just glad...
that we've given each other a better last memory.
What?
I don't know.
If we'd really thought it through,
then for the last time we'd have--
What?
Is he in there?
I can't see anything.
Keep your voices down. She's sleeping.
No, she's not.
Oh. Sorry, um,
We were just looking for Dr. Shepherd.
He's not here.
He'll be back. He went to take Zola home.
What do you need?
He asked us to come up with something nice to say
about Heather to her mom for after she knows.
We're having trouble coming up with
something that's appropriate.
We were thinking if we looked at
some of the cases she worked on with Dr. Shepherd,
we could talk about those.
Her mother is not gonna give a crap
about her glioblastoma.
She wants to hear about how you loved her
and how she was like your family.
Nothing?
Doesn't have to be deep.
When my friend George died, I told his mother a story
about how he stole us all jell-o cups.
and then he dropped them all over the floor
and made a huge mess.
And then he tried to clean it up
with those blue bed pads, which only made it worse
because, of course, those blue bed pads
aren't absorbent at all.
It's not a sonnet, but it made her smile.
And then she went back to crying.
Okay.
Asleep?
What do you think?
My mother's planning on moving Richard to another hospital.
What?
I know.
I know you weren't sure about how to handle
Richard's medical decisions, but I'm just telling you,
you turn the reins over to her,
that's exactly what she's gonna do with them.
Okay... get me a wheelchair.
You just had a splenectomy and a child.
I'm not putting you in a wheelchair.
Jackson, just get me a wheelchair.
There are no chaplains anywhere in the building.
Everyone is out dealing with storm victims.
We have storm victims right here.
What--chaplains are supposed to stay here!
Anybody seen my patient Brian?
Firefighter, busted ribs...
Yeah, he's getting married.
Not without a chaplain, he's not.
Well, I can go online and get certified by
that place on the internet, but me and weddings,
today-- I don't think that I'm the best choice.
The damn firefighters keep taking off--injured.
If you see any of them,
tell them to stay in their damn beds.
Kepner.
What?
Get me a wheelchair.
April!
I don't think we can be friends.
Really?
This will keep happening.
I...
really wanted to be able to work with you.
Yeah, of course.
But if we...
you know, talk on the phone or...
grab lunch...
Just because I'm the one
who said it was time...
doesn't mean this is easy for me.
I know.
This is not easy for me.
What do you really believe
is the best course of treatment?
It's not that simple.
Yes, it is.
You always taught us, when you know, you know.
I think there is something in there,
and no matter how much it stresses his heart,
I think letting it get worse is worse.
Hi. This is Dr. Grey.
I need to book an O.R. for an exploratory laparotomy.
Surgeon is Bailey.
Patient is Webber.
They're opening him up again.
Yep. Don't say anything.
I'm not.
She thought it was a stupid idea the first time
and even more stupid the second time.
You're the one who has to decide
what Richard would want. Wouldn't want to be you.
Thanks.
But to be clear,
when you're making these decisions for me,
give my heart at least 24 hours to recover
before you cut me stem to stern.
You just couldn't hold it in, could you?
Wait, she's your health care proxy?
I get to make the decisions for everyone.
Not Qwen?
No.
Who's yours?
I never filled out the forms.
I had the papers back when it was gonna be Izzie.
That was a bad plan.
That was all a bad plan.
Why do you think I never turned them in?
Mer could be yours, too.
You think I make the wrong decisions all the time.
I don't know why you're selling me to him.
Will you stop being so insecure?
Just because I disagree with you
doesn't mean I don't respect what you think.
I can hold more than one point of view in my mind.
I am mature.
I don't believe you.
You can be mine.
Health care proxy? Really?
I mean, Mer's got enough to take care of.
You want extraordinary measures
or should I just unplug you?
Use your judgment.
Sharpie lady's ready.
Mom!
You knew they were taking him back into the O.R.?
Right, now you can't march in there and shut 'em down.
The hell I can't.
He didn't choose you to make his decisions.
He chose Meredith.
How's the E.R.?
Quiet for a while.
But we got a couple of ambulances on their way in--
People they pulled out of the pile.
Can I come?
No, no. You're supposed to be working.
I don't need the night out.
We're supposed to be sitting around
telling Heather stories.
Turns out we're not a very tight group.
You think you're not.
But when it all hits the fan...
You'll be glad you have 'em.
Someone just died. Shouldn't this be the time?
Come on.
You're not gonna go cry to them when we break up...
and you have to move your trash bag full of crap
out of my house?
Okay, one--
I never leave more than a change of underwear
and a toothbrush in anyone else's house.
That's smart.
And two--I will have dumped your sorry ass,
so I'm not gonna be crying.
I'm just gonna feel bad
that I made it so you can never love again.
Oh, yeah. It's gonna be ugly.
But see...
I've got Mer and Cristina.
I can cry to them.
When the next guy after me breaks your heart...
I'm gonna want my bitches.
Voila!This--it'll help.
Brian and Sasha...
Your commitment
to each other is an inspiration.
Your love, your devotion-- it's unwavering.
You aren't swayed by anything
that life puts in your path.
When people talk about marriage,
this is exactly what they oughta have in mind.
I can't believe I yelled at a woman
who clawed dying victims out of the mud
and triaged them with her bleeding little hands.
Super tacky.
I think I'm the worst person I've ever met.
Shut up.
It speaks.
It wants more booze.
All right.
All right, we all have to focus.
Heather.
She was a fine, upstanding citizen
with limitless potential.
You say that to my mom when I'm dead,
and she's gonna know you're lying.
My mom will believe it.
You can say it when I'm dead.
Write it down 'cause I'm gonna forget.
That I was a nice person?
How is it that we spend this much time together
and we don't really know anything about each other?
So tell us something we don't know.
About me?
Don't be shy.
What?
I can't.
You guys are gonna hate me more than you already do.
No, we won't.
Circle of trust.
My mom knew Mark Sloan.
The one who died?
They, like, dated a hundred years ago or something.
And he kind of helped me get into the program.
What?!
I knew it.
I knew you didn't make it in here on your own.
You are such an evil cow.
Whatever.
At least I got in here on my own merit.
What happened to the circle of trust?
I was a street kid.
Foster homes, lived in my car.
You were not.
Hand to god.
Really? Do you know how to pickpocket?
No. I wasn't Oliver Twist.
Could you teach me how to shoplift?
No!
It'll help me in the O.R. Calm hands under pressure.
You couldn't handle it.
You could.
Thank you.
I... went through college on a cheerleading scholarship.
What?!
No!
Yes.
That is my child!
okay, so I can screw some whore on shore leave,
but this is over the line?
I could have called the police on you--
Okay, and now she's your baby.
I had to talk you into even considering having a child.
And I had to talk you into marriage.
Yeah, because I knew it would be a mistake.
And you know what? It was.
You cannot take a baby and just disappear...
Look at the stars and the sky light.
Yeah? Yeah, should we go ups--
Let's go to the swing. Should we go to the swing?
Okay. Go to the swing.
Go to the swing. Let's go to the swing.
We are excited, united...
And here to win the fight.
We're here to meet you, defeat you...
We dominate tonight!
Tigers...
Tigers...
Tigers.
Tigers.
Tigers.
Excuse me,
somebody said you might be able to help me
find my daughter
Heather Brooks.
We have run this bowel four times now,
and there is nothing there.
I don't know how much longer we can keep at this.
Come on.
I know you're in there.
Owen.
Oh, my god.
The pancreas. Look at that.
That's all necrotic tissue hiding underneath.
Get her some forceps, please.
And--and a 15-blade.
Here you go, doctor.
Somebody call Meredith Grey up in maternity.
On it.
Tell her, "when you know, you know"!
It was a beautiful wedding.
What you said--
Can we not?
Why are you snapping at me all day?
I'm not snapping.
Yeah, you are.
I'm sorry I asked the question.
It obviously made you really uncomfortable,
and I guess that's my answer.
There's no need to beat a dead horse.
That's what it's supposed to look like, you know.
I mean, they can't even imagine not being together.
Do you see the difference between that
and "I think I'll marry this guy,
or maybe I'll marry that guy,
who I banged in a bathroom
because I flipped out over my boards,
but when he was into me, I couldn't handle it.
but suddenly, when he almost dies,
I can't live without him."
That is so unfair!
It's what happened!
You didn't want me when I was okay--
when I wanted you.
No, you just want me now
because you are in something that is real...
and that--
that scares the crap out of you.
Marry this guy because you want to make a life with him,
or don't, and move on.
But none of this has to do with me.
No, this is...
entirely about you.
I'm very sorry about how I spoke to you yesterday.
With the storm and everything, and we're all just...
Your house...
It didn't make it, did it?
I'm sorry.
You saved a lot of people triaging like you did.
Were you a doctor or something?
No, I've just lived on the side of the mountain
for a long time. It's...
It's not our first storm.
An ex-marine showed me how to do it...
our first mudslide.
Oh, I can't believe I have to build that house again.
Maybe you should find someplace else.
No. We're a few houses on the side of a mountain,
and we take care of each other.
I'm sure you'd find new friends.
No one else would have me.
She was really good.
Fast hands.
One time...
we'd all been working all night,
and we were starving,
and she went to where they make the food trays
for the patients,
and she stole Jell-O cups for all of us.
And they fell all over the floor.
She tried to use one of those blue hospital pads
to clean it up, but it just made it worse.
Got everywhere.
Jo told Heather that
she swiped an apple from a grocery store
when she was a kid.
And Heather asked her to teach her how to shoplift.
She thought it would improve her surgical technique.
You must have been close.
April, I really don't have time for this.
Please just-- just... please.
I want to accept your proposal...
in private,
without anybody pressuring me to say "yes."
And I want to do it in front of God.
Actually--actually, no, you know what? No.
I-I'm not accepting your proposal,
I am proposing to you.
I want to be your wife.
I think you need to think some stuff out.
I did.
Okay.
Yes, it was Jackson.
And... yes, I-I have feelings for him.
He's always gonna be a part of my life.
And that gets confusing sometimes,
especially when he's
pulling babies out of burning buses.
But...
I... I-I'm not good at this.
I--this is all new to me.
Okay, I was never the girl that got picked at the dance.
I-I-I'm not good at it,
and I'm indecisive
because I see eight sides of everything.
And that's what you're picking when you pick me.
And you may not want that.
I thought maybe nobody would ever want that.
April--
But I... I want you.
I want to marry you.
So will you marry me?
Sofia is downstairs in the day care.
I'm sorry I called you a baby-snatcher.
I was upset,
and I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.
You were just trying to cool off,
and that was the right thing to do--
Sofia and I will be staying at Mer's again tonight.
That'll be two nights with me.
You can take her the following two nights.
And we'll switch off like that
until we can figure out a real schedule.
Well, how long is-- is this gonna be going on?
I don't know.
Dr. Ben Warren,
this is your wife.
Sorry... I keep missing you. It's--
It's been...
Something happened with Richard--
A health situation.
I got involved in that.
He's still unconscious.
I don't know how he's going to...
But he's alive.
Heather's uncle just arrived.
He's with her mom, and her brother's on his way.
Thank you for staying with her.
Go home. Get some rest.
You need to tell your guys
to stop going out to the damn pile if they're injured.
I keep patching up the same damn guys.
I could tell 'em, but it's not gonna make any difference.
They can't just sit around.
It... makes them nuts.
All right, try harder!
Where's the rig?
You okay? You sure?
Okay. Out back.
Hey, sir?
Can I ride out there with you guys?
Sure.
What are you doing? Shane!
Shane, you're not a firefighter!
Shane!
Stupid.
Damn it.
What are you doing?
We're his people. We have to go.
Uh, actually, no, we don't. We're
not trained--
Sharpie lady helped.
Sharpie lady almost got herself killed.
We have to go.
I don't know what the deal is with him and Heather.
I don't know if it's their weird competition thing.
Or maybe they were having secret sex in the bathrooms.
I don't care. Whatever it is,
Shane hasn't said a single word since she died,
and we're what he has. We're what we have.
Maybe we get through this program normal.
Or maybe we end up cranky, work-obsessed people
who live on the side of a mountain
and have no family or children,
and we only have each other
because no one else can stand us.
What is she talking--
get up!
E-everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, uh,
Meredith just wants me to hang out at her house.
Zola needs some attention.
And Derek is pretty wiped out.
Callie and Sofia are there, so...
Is there anything I can do? I mean, I could, uh...
Good night.
Yeah.
Zola is asleep.
All right, little miss...
In five minutes, it's your turn.
To be clear, I am happy to do the dishes,
but there is no universe in which I generate dinner.
All right, we'll figure it out.
Mac and cheese.
Oh, no, we had that last night.
Well, and it was good. Right? It was good.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry to bother everybody.
No, it's okay.
Can I see her for just a minute?
You saw her this afternoon. You can get her tomorrow night.
I know.
But cou--
You can see her when it's your night.
I could, uh... I could just take her on the--
on the front porch for a minute,
and I'm not gonna take her.
Do you have any idea how confusing this is for her?
Yeah, I realize that.
Well, you know what?
She's supposed to be in bed right now.
How am I supposed to get her to sleep
with you coming and going?
Five minutes.
Are you kidding me?
She shows up here with this act,
and you're just gonna take her side?
Callie--
It's an act.
Callie, look at me.
I'm your friend.
Five minutes.
Come here, Sofia.
Come here, baby. Okay. Yeah.
Whee! come on, baby.
We just want to survive the storm.
I missed you so much.
We pray,
"please, God, just get me to the other side."
We never imagine what it'll be like when we get there.
I love you so much.
And I miss you every second.
'cause you're my girl.
What if when the storm passes, nothing's left?
I always said I could handle anything.
I was wrong.
I was wrong about a lot of things.
I think there's no harm in getting another opinion.
Was I or was I not correct?
Why does that make you feel so threatened?
You know, I'm another opinion, and I have to tip my hat.
Dr. Bailey called it.
Nobody said it wasn't good to deal with the pancreas,
but he is still clearly unstable.
He hasn't regained consciousness--
None of that is unusual.
I would like to bring in another person--
somebody that could tell us
I will make the decision.
You've said what you think, and then you said it again.
And I will take that under advisement.
Dr. Grey--
He picked you to be his girlfriend.
And we're all very happy about that.
But he picked me to be his family.
And you walked away from that responsibility
the second that--
No one said I would be good at it.
And he knew that. But he picked me anyway.
I'm the family.
Meredith.
Please, don't get involved.
But I was right about one thing.
