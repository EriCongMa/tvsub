第三季 第十集
wow . they found a way to make the human being even creepier .
covering him in icicles .
i think it &apos;s festive .
yeah , my favorite christmas tradition is trimming the hellraiser .
guys , i found something we can watch together
for christmas this year .
the long @-@ lost 1981 inspector spacetime holiday special .
run time two and half hours and so critically reviled
that after it aired , the creator has his knighthood revoked .
that sounds terrible .
i want to watch it twice ,
but i &apos;m spending christmas with my relatives .
or rather , i &apos;m spending the day with my relatives
while they refuse to acknowledge christmas .
you jehovah &apos;s witnesses-- so severe .
andre and i will be spending christmas giving gifts
to the more persuadable of our jewish friends .
i wouldn &apos;t call an unannounced visit from your pastor &quot; a gift . &quot;
and don &apos;t bother this year .
i &apos;ll be at the movies with my bubbe .
you &apos;re not taking both of them ?
well , one &apos;s dead .
what ?
i was looking forward to hanging out with you guys this christmas .
this semester has been so long and dark and angry .
i was thinking we could have some light @-@ hearted fun as a family .
i think what we &apos;ve learned , abed ,
is that attempts to make the holidays brighter
tend to give them a certain darkness .
oh , i don &apos;t know if i agree with that .
* deck the halls with boughs of holly *
actually , maybe i do .
* &apos; tis the season to be jolly *
* fa la la la la la la rock on *
merry christmas , greendale .
glee club here , reminding you
that our christmas pageant is coming .
next stop , regionals !
what the hell are &quot; regionals ? &quot;
they never stop talking about it .
* i said deck *
please tell me we were not this obnoxious the year
we filled in for them .
t @-@ minus five seconds till hip @-@ hop remix .
four , three .
come on ! re @-@ re @-@ re @-@ remix !
re @-@ re @-@ re @-@ remix !
* fa la la la la f @-@ a l @-@ a , come on whoo *
you &apos;re awfully quiet , jeff .
nobody hates glee club more than you .
today i &apos;m just content to sit back and enjoy the show .
and now our pop music mash @-@ up !
elton lil &apos; john lennon !
kick it !
* hey , tiny dancer *
* okay *
stop !
cease and desist .
glee club , meet ascap ,
protecting musical copyrights since 1914 .
it appears they have received an anonymous tip
that unlicensed material was being performed here
without the artists &apos; permission .
merry christmas , everyone .
glee club just became history club .
my soul is dead !
okay , if anyone asks , we were never here .
why ?
the glee club is at westside hospital ,
recuperating from a collective nervous breakdown .
this is the second glee club we &apos;ve lost in two years .
we might have to cancel the christmas pageant .
and to think they were this close to regionals .
what the hell are regionals ?
they &apos;re this close , pierce .
anyway , an old friend wants to talk to you .
your favorite glee club instructor ,
the dreamy and boyish mr. cory radison !
uh , i thought i told you to call me mr. rad .
or cory .
just don &apos;t call me &quot; late to dinner . &quot;
unless you &apos;re serving brussels sprouts !
i won &apos;t , i promise !
this guy &apos;s like human froyo .
look , when the last glee club died in that bus crash ,
you guys stepped up .
and you were the best gosh darn emergency substitutes
i &apos;ve ever worked with .
well , this time ...
i &apos;m not gonna kid you . it won &apos;t be easy .
your best ...
won &apos;t be good enough .
and ten times your best will be so bad ,
i will yell at you .
but i promise , if we dig down--
pass .
yeah .
okay .
don &apos;t you hurt him .
mr. rad !
i feel like we let mr. rad down .
no , he let himself down when he left the house
this morning wearing a sweater @-@ vest .
i guess we did have fun last time .
did we ? i can hardly remember .
it &apos;s all a weird , happy , musical fog .
yeah , it was almost like being on ecstasy ,
only instead of having pointless conversations
and dancing like idiots-- wait .
it was exactly like being on ecstasy !
that &apos;s what worries me about this guy .
he is equal parts hanson and manson .
nobody let him corner you until he is out of recruitment mode ,
or next thing you know ,
we &apos;ll all be caring about christmas pageants and ...
regionals .
you &apos;re right , deal .
ugh .
agreed .
got you .
what the hell are regionals ?
what are you still doing here ?
i thought i &apos;d give her one more tinkle
before i took down decorations .
no glee club means no pageant , means no christmas .
i &apos;m sure trying to make things brighter
just would &apos;ve made more darkness .
that sounds like a certain ex @-@ lawyer talking .
i see a lot of myself in you , abed .
you care about your friends ,
and you wish they cared more about each other .
that &apos;s not an easy position to be in sometimes .
i just want my friends and i to have a merry christmas together .
well , maybe you could start
by giving them the greatest christmas gift of all .
what &apos;s that ?
glee !
* it &apos;s a feeling you get *
* when your brain finally lets your heart get in its pants *
* glee *
* it &apos;s like a drug that you use *
* that turns pain into shoes *
* and your shoes into dance *
how &apos;s your piano still playing this song ?
* glee is the answe r *
* when questions are wrong *
* you &apos;ll understand if you just sing along *
* &apos; cause glee is the gift *
* that you need *
* glee is what i &apos;ll spread to my friends *
* like a virus that sends them to a healthier place *
* glee ! i &apos;ll understand every scene *
* because they &apos;ll sing what they mean *
* instead of making a face *
* families are closer when families are winning *
* everything &apos;s cooler when cameras are spinning *
* singing and dancing in unison ... in @-@ inning *
* glee is the gift *
* that we need *
glee !
thank you , mr. rad .
don &apos;t break down the set yet .
i &apos;m gonna try to get my friends to be in the christmas pageant .
thank you , abed !
thank you .
merry christmas , troy .
abed , you look gleeful .
troy , don &apos;t you think it might actually be fun ,
doing this christmas pageant for the glee club ?
abed , we hate the glee club .
yeah .
i guess i just like liking things .
abed .
look , you know i &apos;d do anything you did , but ...
i &apos;m a jehovah &apos;s witness .
we &apos;re not supposed to celebrate christmas .
i &apos;ve been thinking about that .
i may have a loophole .
what if you were a jehovah &apos;s witness
that was merely pretending to be into christmas ,
gathering clues and blending in
to take down the holidays from within ?
you mean like a spy investigating ,
making it seem like i &apos;m celebrating ,
when actually i &apos;m infiltrating santa &apos;s operation ?
yoip !
* going deep cover *
* past enemy lines *
* making everybody think i &apos;m on the christmas side *
* rocking warm sweaters , hanging big @-@ ass lights *
* if the fat man can see me , yo it &apos;s gotta look right *
* i &apos;ll watch all the tv specials that i never could *
* i &apos;ll even cry during the sad ones , like james bond would *
* and when the big night comes , it &apos;s time to set the bait *
* cold milk , hot cookies , decorative plate *
* and he &apos;ll come down the chim @-@ in @-@ ey *
* and it will be just him and me *
* but he won &apos;t know we &apos;re enemies *
* &apos; cause i &apos;ll play sincere , spring a trap *
* like that , hug him tight , get on his lap *
* and tell him he can come back every year *
* &apos; cause i am jehovah &apos;s most secret witness *
* so i might have to dedicate my life to christmas *
* and act just like i love it till the day i die *
* a @-@ b @-@ e @-@ d connoisseur of christmas *
* on the spectrum , none of your business *
* talks to fast to comprehend *
* just wanna do right by my friend *
* if years were seasons , this december *
* would be the december of our december *
* more blueprints than howard hughes *
* but if they are blue prints , how do we choose *
* we have to be happy to get to the end *
* we have to save christmas to save our friends *
* we have to save christmas to save our friends *
* we have to save christmas to save our friends *
hey , guys .
rapping ?
yep , wanna join us ?
totally !
wait , you guys never let me rap with you .
well , we &apos;re gonna need all hands on deck
if we &apos;re gonna go to regionals .
cool .
i just need to ... study ...
though ... in my room .
so have fun !
and then , this morning ,
i could hear them in the bathroom ,
doing country western mash @-@ ups .
and they won &apos;t stop talking about regionals !
maybe it &apos;s nothing .
yeah , if &quot; nothing &quot; wears a sweater @-@ vest
and seems aggressively asexual .
come on , let &apos;s all study for our biology final
in our old--
where &apos;s our table ?
who &apos;s that guy ?
you guys all see him too , right ?
hey , guys .
merry christmas , y &apos;all .
sorry about the rearrangement .
we need this space to rehearse for the pageant .
but we &apos;re not doing the pageant .
look , guys , i hear your negativity ,
but also , can i counter with this ?
who hates glee ?
listen to how that sounds .
glee literally means &quot; glee . &quot;
oh , stop it !
not liking glee club doesn &apos;t make us bullies ,
and implying that is reverse bullying .
good point . sing about it ?
no !
i understand them , but you , pierce ?
your generation invented music !
i don &apos;t know about &quot; invented . &quot;
perfected , maybe .
pierce !
they &apos;re just trying to pander to your demographics&apos;
well @-@ documented historical vanity . resist !
abed , wasn &apos;t santa claus himself
part of pierce &apos;s peer group ?
i believe so .
one , two , three , four .
* santa claus was born in 1945 *
* he had a boogie woogie coca @-@ cola army jive *
* and when the commies gave the polio to doris day *
* santa helped the beatles chase mccarthy away *
* that baby boomer santa *
* he &apos;s never gonna die *
* santa fought at woodstock and vietnam *
* and smoked a ton of acid and burnt his bra *
* and then in 1970 , he did more drugs *
* and his hair stayed long and he *
* grew a mustache *
* baby boomer santa *
* he &apos;s gonna stay ali @-@ i @-@ i @-@ ive *
* santa invented spielberg and microchips *
* santa inventecoca @-@ cola and aerobics *
* he made the iron curtain and the gremlins 2 *
* fake butter and aids twin peaks ! *
* baby boomer santa *
* thank you for mtv *
* baby boomer santa *
* thank you for everything *
* you &apos;re welcome *
* you &apos;re welcome for everything in the world *
* you &apos;re welcome *
* you &apos;re welcome for all that i bring to the world
* i &apos;m baby boomer santa *
* i bring the gift of the world *
* baby boomer santa *
* i &apos;m an american pearl *
pierce is on board .
that &apos;s great !
for the christmas queen , i &apos;m hoping we can get shirley or annie .
they both have really strong voices
and natural * vibrato . *
there &apos;s also britta .
britta &apos;s adorable !
so shirley or annie for the christmas queen .
there &apos;s a leaf on britta &apos;s head .
she &apos;s playing a tree !
and it &apos;s gonna be so fun !
mr. radison , who authorized you to rearrange our study room ,
and who do you think you are anyway ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
* well *
* well *
* well *
i &apos;m scared to go into the study room .
there are so many top hats in there .
i wish there was a way we could stop all this .
i mean , i realize the stakes aren &apos;t actually that high ,
but somehow , that just makes it extra scary .
i know .
jeff , i think i know what mr. rad is up to .
there &apos;s something you have to see .
mr. rad plans to get every single member
of our study group to join the glee club .
well , i don &apos;t know how he thinks that &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;ll show you .
wha-- ?
this is just one of the many costume changes
i &apos;ll be doing during the show .
we &apos;re a shoo @-@ in for regionals , right ?
annie , you too ?
this is beneath you .
you are an intelligent woman .
also , you &apos;re jewish !
i guess i have a lot to learn about holiday tradition .
* teach me how to understand christmas *
* show me how to open a box *
* it hurts my little head *
* when i &apos;m lying in my bed *
* with visions of sugarplum socks *
is this a bit ?
* teach me how to understand christmas *
* do i trim the tree *
* or the deer ? *
* i can &apos;t keep it straight *
* and now it &apos;s getting late *
* where does the stocking go ? *
* here ? *
i can &apos;t see !
* what &apos;s a christmas eve ? *
* is that santa &apos;s lady ? *
* are snowmen cold or hot ? *
* won &apos;t you be my daddy ? *
* i &apos;m a silly christmas baby *
* tell me what to deck *
* &apos; cause i forgot *
annie .
ooh !
* &quot; bwain &quot; hurt @-@ y , understand @-@ y &quot; cwistmas &quot; *
* mistletoe for eat @-@ y , taste good ? &quot;
* you smarty , me dumb *
* help &quot; pwetty &quot; have fun *
* sex *
look , eventually , you hit a point of diminishing returns
on the sexiness .
what &apos;s a dimin-- ?
stay back , old man .
don &apos;t even hum .
shirley , britta , i have no intention of singing .
good .
i can &apos;t speak for these little angels though .
* there &apos;s a magic in the air *
* around us *
* we all have the sudden urge to bake *
* it feels like a very special birthday *
* but whose name should be written on the cake ? *
shirley , you need to get out of here !
* we asked our public school to give the answer *
they &apos;re not gonna tell you .
* but they could only teach us not to pray *
that &apos;s what they do . that &apos;s what they do .
* the constitution says the state can &apos;t tell us *
* was anyone important born today ? *
oh , gotta tell the babies !
* jesus christ ! *
* jesus christ is the lord *
* happy birthday , jesus *
* happy birthday *
* cut the cake , cut the cake now *
* cut the cake , my lord *
oh , jeff , thank god !
they got shirley ! it &apos;s just you and me now .
jeff ?
guys , i am swelling with pride !
you stepped up , and you saved the christmas pageant !
and it &apos;s all thanks to you , mr.rad.
i just hope we can repay you by making regionals .
uh , i thought this was regionals .
don &apos;t let my confusion undercut their importance .
places , everyone !
scooch , scooch , scooch , scooch , scooch .
i could not have done this without your recruiting skills , abed .
i was happy to do it . for a while there , i thought
we were gonna end the semester on a really dark note .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re singing and dancing together instead .
this has been a good time .
and it &apos;s going to continue to be a good time .
if we win regionals , then it &apos;s straight on to sectionals .
and then a week later is semis . then semiregionals .
then regional @-@ semis .
then national lower @-@ zone semis !
but i kinda thought this was ...
you know , just for christmas .
no , no , no .
this is forever .
this is what we do now .
this is who we are .
* we are planet christmas when we sing *
* we will sing together throughout everything *
* we are planet christmas *
britta .
is this about regionals ?
i just talked to cory ,
and he needs you to be the mouse king instead of me .
me ? but i &apos;m supposed to be a mute tree .
it &apos;s an emergency .
hmm ?
this will help us get to regionals !
i knew it ! wait , what are the lyrics ?
they &apos;re in your heart , britta .
right . duh doy !
* we are everyone , and we are everything *
* christmas time ! *
what the-- ?
oh , britta &apos;s in this ?
* i got a christmas time for me *
* i got a christmas time for a tree *
no ! she &apos;s ruining it !
* christmas *
* christmas time *
* me so christmas , me so merry *
no , stop , stop , stop , stop !
what are you doing ? get off the stage !
i &apos;m singing my heart &apos;s song .
get off the stage , and never sing again !
you are the worst !
hey !
you do not get to call britta &quot; the worst . &quot;
yeah !
let her finish !
mr. radison , i think it &apos;s fine .
i know greendale is an all @-@ inclusive school .
why don &apos;t we let britta sing her awkward song ?
yeah !
no , no , no , no , no , no !
this show is supposed to be gleeful and bright and fun ,
and you can let me do that ,
or there can be another bus crash !
well , figuratively .
i &apos;m not saying ,
&quot; i killed the last glee club . &quot;
i &apos;m saying you not listening to me
is like metaphorically cutting the brake lines on your own--
look , kings of leon !
what did he say ?
did mr. rad kill the last glee club ?
and to think i trusted him enough
to captain a magic carpet in that dream i had last night .
maybe jeff &apos;s right .
maybe forcing things to be bright just makes
the darkness underneath even darker .
this was all my fault , insisting we do the pageant .
sorry .
merry christmas .
i guess i &apos;ll just see you guys after the holidays .
happy time day , reggie .
it is tradition to give one &apos;s constable a gift
at the end of each orbital cycle .
oh , thank you , inspector !
blimey ! a hologram ?
mm @-@ hmm .
let &apos;s activate it and view the performance .
* i tried to find a way around *
* then get behind your wall *
* i tried to reach the top *
this is terrible .
* ( the first noel ) the angels did say *
* was to certain poor shepherds *
* in fields where they lay *
* in fields where they *
* lay keeping their sheep *
* on a cold winter &apos;s night that was so deep *
we decided we wanted to spend the holiday together .
it &apos;s been a dark semester .
i basically killed a guy .
and i kind of attacked you guys with a fire axe .
yeah .
i &apos;m thinking about seeing a new shrink .
what ?
don &apos;t .
holy crap .
look how terrible this christmas special is .
* noel , noel *
* noel , noel *
* we will see you *
* after regionals *
