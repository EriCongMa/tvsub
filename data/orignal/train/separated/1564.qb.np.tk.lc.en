callie , i &apos;m ed craig , your new p.o.
have a seat .
how &apos;re you doing in here ?
ok .
this is your second time in juvie ?
yeah .
you were in last time for
taking a bat to your foster father &apos;s car ?
he was beating my little brother at the time .
you love your brother ?
of course .
just two weeks ago you told your social worker
you liked your new foster home .
did something change ?
they asked us if they could adopt us .
and that &apos;s not what you want ?
i &apos;m sixteen . i don &apos;t need to be adopted .
any idea what you do need ?
yeah ... to be out of the system ... on my own .
then why &apos;d you get yourself arrested and sent back here ?
callie , you &apos;re still a kid .
like it or not , you need an adult to care for you .
whether it &apos;s in the system or back with your foster moms ...
no , i can &apos;t go back there .
you can send me to a different foster home ,
or leave me here , i don &apos;t care .
just ... i want them to adopt my little brother .
i do .
so , just tell them ...
to give up on you ?
so ... i &apos;m going back to work next week .
just wanted to let everybody know .
what about dad ?
captain roberts says that he should be cleared in a couple days .
are you scared ?
i &apos;m not . are you ?
a little .
yeah ?
can &apos;t you get like a desk job or something ?
did you know being a cop
is not even one of the top ten most dangerous professions ?
that &apos;s true . we &apos;re lucky
she &apos;s not an airplane pilot , or a logger .
or a crab fisherman . that &apos;s very dangerous .
or an ice road trucker .
is that what it &apos;s called an &quot; ice road trucker &quot; ?
what &apos;s going to happen to callie ?
well , tomorrow , sweetheart , she gets to go before the judge
and the judge will decide if she gets more probation or ...
stays in juvie ? she got beat up last time .
i know it &apos;s scary , sweetheart ,
but we &apos;re gonna do whatever we can .
can we go to court with you ?
what ?
callie doesn &apos;t want us to be there .
too bad .
i mean you have to talk to the judge , right ?
so that way she can come home .
unless you don &apos;t want her anymore .
of course we want her .
it is not a question of whether we want callie .
it is ...
it is whether she wants us .
she does .
she ran away , brandon . for no reason .
i &apos;m not really sure that she wants to be here .
she didn &apos;t run away for no reason .
is there something you want to share with us ?
something you know that we don &apos;t ?
she ran away because i kissed her .
when did this happen ?
at the wedding .
when at our wedding ?
honey ...
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
i didn &apos;t expect this to happen .
well , what did you expect ?
let &apos;s just take a second .
no .
you expected that we were gonna adopt her
and the two of you would date ?
i don &apos;t know !
i ... i can &apos;t .
brandon , did callie run away because she didn &apos;t feel safe ?
what ? no . no !
jude saw us , ok ? and he freaked out .
he said that you guys wouldn &apos;t adopt them . that &apos;s why she left ,
so she wouldn &apos;t screw things up for him .
honey . if cps found out ,
they could take callie and jude out of this house .
you knew that , brandon . i warned you .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , sorry doesn &apos;t hack it .
i can &apos;t help how i feel .
go inside , please .
we need to talk .
are you so horny you can &apos;t keep your hands off our foster sister ?
ok , you know what ? she kissed me too .
i &apos;m tired of everyone &apos;s making me seem like i &apos;m some sort of ...
liam ?
screw you .
i &apos;m surprised you haven &apos;t tried .
mariana , that &apos;s gross .
look , i didn &apos;t grow up with callie .
she &apos;s been here two months and until a few days ago ,
this was only supposed to be a temporary thing .
well , then , why would you say that we could adopt them ?
because i wanted her to be happy .
and you think she &apos;s happy now ? in juvie ?
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
ok , you &apos;ve never even had a boyfriend .
well , you know what i can understand ?
you &apos;ve royally screwed this whole family .
look , you get it , right ?
you couldn &apos;t help how you felt about lexi .
we weren &apos;t gonna adopt lexi .
why did you tell ?
because now that they know why she left ,
they &apos;ll bring her back .
i should have seen this was happening .
me too .
when did we become these parents who have no idea
what the hell is going on underneath their own roof ?
when we became parents of teenagers ,
who are impulsive and secretive .
even the brandons .
what are we gonna do ?
hey , sweetheart .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you .
come here and sit , please .
we want you to know that this does not change anything .
it does not change how much we love you .
and want to adopt you . ok ?
well , what about callie ?
we &apos;re not giving up on either one of you .
i promise .
callie jacob ?
just nine weeks out of juvie and you &apos;re back for running away ,
violating your probation and stealing .
do you have anything you want to say ?
no ...
your honor .
your honor , callie &apos;s foster moms are present in the court ,
and would like to speak on her behalf .
go ahead .
your honor , in the time that callie has been with
my wife and me and our three other children ,
we saw her make great strides .
she opened up to us emotionally , she did well in school ,
she followed our rules ,
and we feel that she has come to trust us ,
as we have her .
she brought a great deal of
love and joy into our family and we just ...
we feel she deserves a second chance .
however ...
we are not prepared to bring her back into our home at this time .
演唱者 anabel englund
you &apos;re mariana , right ?
yeah .
can i sit ?
um , sure .
cool .
i &apos;m chase .
i &apos;m mariana ... oh ... you ... you &apos;re a senior .
that &apos;s true .
how do you know who i am ?
you helped hang posters for the last school play .
check it out . we &apos;re doing the glass menagerie next ,
and we need people to help crew .
and , you like , remembered me ?
you made an impression .
so , if you &apos;re interested , we &apos;re having a meeting after school .
it &apos;d be cool to see you there .
&quot; where have you been all this time ? &quot;
&quot; i have been to the movies . &quot;
&quot; all this time at the movies ? &quot;
there was a very long program that was ...
we don &apos;t need to do this speech .
ok . &quot; tom , shhh ! &quot;
we have to break up .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not a line in the play .
i &apos;m so sorry , talya .
we ... we ...
i should have never gotten back with you .
then why did you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really care about you , ok , i really do ...
... but ...
you don &apos;t love me .
so , honestly this time ... is it because of callie ?
talya ...
just ... i just need to hear you admit it .
so i know i &apos;m not crazy .
yes . it &apos;s callie .
brandon .
what ?
she &apos;s just going to hurt you .
you ... you don &apos;t know ...
i don &apos;t .
... everything .
sending chase out with flyers was obviously the right strategy .
of course , not a lot of boys showed up .
but that &apos;s ok . girls work harder . except me .
i &apos;m the lighting designer ,
which is kind of a big deal since i &apos;m only a freshman .
oh , but i &apos;m fifteen .
my parents held me back for years so i &apos;d be better at sports .
definitely not the right strategy .
uh ... i &apos;m zac by the way .
mariana .
all right , let &apos;s get started .
first , thanks for representing .
it &apos;s awesome to see so much interest in the school play .
yeah , right . the play .
now , we need to fill a lot of crew positions ,
but , one of the most important , is costumes .
otherwise , we &apos;re going to be like , on stage naked .
but seriously , the costume designer
helps us create our characters .
it &apos;s a totes collaborative thing .
&quot; totes ? &quot;
mariana .
and ... kelsey .
don &apos;t feel too bad , he knows everyone &apos;s name .
i mean , except , mine .
i have an idea , it &apos;s a big job so ,
why don &apos;t the two of you work together ?
so , there &apos;s this hot new vintage store downtown .
i was thinking ...
i can &apos;t do costumes with you .
but , i thought we made up at wyatt &apos;s party ?
you lied . you put the blame on callie .
i was covering your ass .
look , everybody knows i went to rehab .
but what they don &apos;t know is that you were my dealer .
do you know why ?
because i kept that a secret ...
because i thought you were my friend .
i guess i was wrong .
are they here ?
inside . hey , wanna give me a hand ...
i &apos;ll help .
great .
you gotta beat me at a game of 21 first .
all right .
you &apos;re on .
age before beauty .
演唱者 the futures league
too easy .
is she here ?
no .
well , what did the judge say ? when is she coming home ?
sit . let &apos;s talk .
callie &apos;s not coming home .
forever ?
no , but not ...
not until we &apos;ve all had time to figure out how this can work .
the two of you under the same roof .
i &apos;ll go live with dad then .
that &apos;s not an option .
why not ?
callie has bigger issues to deal with .
she makes reckless decisions , brandon .
whenever she feels out of control or confused ...
she needs to learn coping skills .
so she &apos;s going to learn them in juvie ?
judge agreed to send her to a group home .
what ?
once you &apos;re in a group home you &apos;re considered like high risk .
she told me . no one will ever want her again .
we still want her .
well , that &apos;s not what she &apos;s gonna think .
she &apos;s gonna think you &apos;re giving up on her .
like you &apos;re throwing her to the wolves .
well , we hope that eventually she &apos;ll see we &apos;re doing this
because we don &apos;t want to give up on her .
and because we love her .
so , what is this like &quot; tough love &quot; then ?
you know how this is gonna feel to callie ?
after all she &apos;s been through ? like no love .
i want to see her .
no .
not right now .
why not ?
because you and callie need a little time and space to ...
what ? to get over each other ?
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen . ok ? we &apos;re in love .
and--and keeping us apart is not gonna to change that .
how long do i have to be here ?
until the judge is convinced you won &apos;t run away again .
this is a safe place .
hey , ed . hi , callie , i &apos;m rita .
welcome to girls united . come on in .
i &apos;ll show you to your room after you meet all the girls .
there are seven girls who live here full @-@ time .
actually one just went home yesterday ,
so , your timing was kind of perfect .
we appreciate you taking callie on such short notice .
your foster moms worked very hard to get you in here .
do i have to share a room ?
yes , you will .
why are there no bars or security gates ?
how do you lock us in ?
we don &apos;t .
we trust that you won &apos;t leave the premises .
but , if you violate that trust , then ...
you go back to juvie .
or you &apos;re placed in a more restrictive group home .
the choice is really yours .
hey , girls . come meet callie .
ok , ladies , you know how this works .
we &apos;re gonna go around the room , tell a little about yourself .
your age , where you &apos;re from , how long you &apos;ve been here ,
why you &apos;re here .
all right , we &apos;re going to start with you , kiara ,
since you &apos;re callie &apos;s roommate and you &apos;ll be her sponsor .
why don &apos;t you start us off .
ok . hi . i &apos;m kiara . i &apos;m fifteen .
i &apos;ve been in juvie , like , three times ? no , four .
the first time i got arrested was for
throwin &apos; bricks at a building when i was like eleven ,
and then for gang stuff you know ,
possessing and selling drugs , assault with a deadly weapon .
but that was like , not my fault , anyway . that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m becka , i &apos;m sixteen ...
oh , and i been here two months .
and i &apos;m always interrupting .
yes , you are .
yeah , so , kiara &apos;s been interrupting me
the four weeks i &apos;ve been here .
becka . feet .
i &apos;m in for drugs .
using and selling . and i , like , punched a cop .
i was shooting drugs in my neck before i came here .
so , if i wasn &apos;t here , i &apos;d probably be dead now .
i &apos;m carmen , i &apos;m 17 , i wanna join the army ...
are we suppose to say what we wanna be ?
that &apos;s ok , honey , keep going .
so , like i been in this home for six months .

thank you for sharing .
daphne , you &apos;re up .
i &apos;m daphne , 17 , been here for about six weeks .
in for gangs , drugs , armed robbery and assault .
oh , and just so you know , callie ,
we have a zero tolerance policy for violence .
if you put your hands on anyone else
you &apos;ll be asked to leave . no exceptions , all right ?
i &apos;m gabi , i &apos;m fifteen . i &apos;ve been here a month .
i &apos;m in for home invasion , robbery , and cyber bullying .
so , now you know a little bit about everyone ,
why don &apos;t you tell us a little bit about you .
i &apos;m 16 . i ran away .
i stole a sandwich .
i don &apos;t belong here .
anyone else feel they don &apos;t belong here ?
ok .
happy to have you , callie .
jude .

i had no idea that they &apos;d do this .

i &apos;m sorry .

what ?
ah , it was so traveling !
it &apos;s jesus &apos; ball .
no way !
how was school , young lady ?
anything new and exciting ?
i &apos;m doing costumes for the school play .
you are ? that &apos;s a big undertaking .

well , good for you , i &apos;m very proud of you .
you ok , babe ?

jesus ? jesus , what &apos;s going on ?
what is going on ?
mariana , go get lena .
jesus . jesus . relax , relax .
shh . slow . slow breaths .
i &apos;m fine . i probably just got , like , dehydrated .
so , dr. levinson thinks
it &apos;s just a short term side @-@ effect from upping his meds .
so , what &apos;s in his meds that would make his heart race ?
well , they &apos;re stimulants , mike .
in kids with adhd
it actually help them to calm down and to focus .
and there &apos;s no other way to treat it without medication ?
there is behavioral modification .
it &apos;s controversial , mike .
and , it &apos;s not like we haven &apos;t talked about it a thousand times .
well , not with me .
i don &apos;t wanna take this stuff .
if i can get off it , don &apos;t i get a say ?
jesus , remember when you went off the pills for a few days ?
you got really aggressive .
and you were bouncing off the walls too , dude , remember ?
i mean , come on , i was bouncing off the walls when i was his age .
what about getting into a contact sport ?
i mean , it helped me .
like football , no , no way .
no , like wrestling .
no way . i &apos;m not groping dudes .
it &apos;s not groping .
it &apos;s using strategic moves to take down your opponent .
it &apos;s physical , gets the aggression out , teaches you mental focus .
i mean , that &apos;s what he needs , right ?
can i at least try it ?
lena ?
ok ?
ok .
but , jesus , you need to be extremely disciplined .
very .
i will be .
do i have to wear a unitard ?
ok , rule number one . never , ever call it a unitard .
it &apos;s called a singlet .
uh ... yeah , this needs a touch up .
why ?
it &apos;s sticky , you gotta wipe it again .
looks clean to me .
well , i &apos;m kitchen foreman
and if you don &apos;t do your job , i get a ua .
cut the newbie a break , nicole .

but , then it also says you &apos;re a girl .
i &apos;m a transgender male . look it up , bitch .
ooh , who &apos;s gettin &apos; a ua now .

how about you knock ?
how about you check the attitude ? move over .
so , mom and lena told me about callie .
ok , dad , i &apos;m not really in the mood for another lecture .
i &apos;m not in the mood to give one .
look , i understand .
she &apos;s not your sister .
yet .
you two have been through a lot together . she &apos;s pretty .
i get it .
it &apos;s more than that .
i know , brandon . but , you &apos;ll get over it . trust me .
if you &apos;re talking about mom , no offense ,
but you didn &apos;t really have a choice .
look , brandon . callie didn &apos;t just run away ,
she ran away with a guy . a guy she &apos;d been dating .
for all you know , that was part of the plan all along .
it wasn &apos;t .
really ?
has she reached out to you ? at all ?
mom and lena told me , wyatt wasn &apos;t just a ride .
she was planning to go all the way to indiana to live with him .
no . why are you telling me this ?
because you need to hear it .
what &apos;s a ua ?
it &apos;s a &quot; unacceptable &quot; for like not doing your jobs
or gettin &apos; into it with the other girls .
if you get five you get a consequence , like an extra job .
this is worse than juvie .
yeah , they &apos;re hard on you here ,
but it &apos;s better than other homes i been in .
like this one i broke this girl &apos;s nose ,
i mean , like , i didn &apos;t mean to .
she was on the ground and i was kicking her ,
but like the staff didn &apos;t even care .
at least here they care about you .
um ... so other than school , do we ever get out of here ?
yeah , sometimes we go on field trips ,
and every once in a while we get to go to the mall .
saturday &apos;s family day .
if you got your privileges , you can have visitors .
your mom or dad around ?
no , i &apos;m in foster care with my brother .
i have a brother .
that &apos;s him .

oh , hey , what do you think ?
for laura ?

why ? it sucks . i suck .
i just wanna get high .

i don &apos;t wanna deal . ok ?
i don &apos;t need to talk about how my mom &apos;s boyfriends
messed with me when i was just a kid .
because who cares ?
where was your mom , she shouldn &apos;t have let that happen .
she was gettin &apos; high .
look , i started smokin &apos; dope with my grandma when i was 11 .
the only person who ever cared about me is my best friend ,

when i was young i smoked a little weed .
and for like half a second , i did some speed .
speed ?
for real ?
that &apos;s for real .
how &apos;d you stop ?
one day , i just decided that
doing drugs wasn &apos;t gonna get me where i wanted to go , so i quit .
now , listen , not everybody can do that .
you ain &apos;t no addict .
i am an addict .
i &apos;m addicted to food .
i &apos;ve struggled with it my entire life .
you know , everyone is addicted to something .
not me . i don &apos;t do drugs .
no ?
you &apos;re addicted to boys !
you don &apos;t ever shut up about your boyfriends .
i haven &apos;t talked to my boyfriend since i &apos;ve been here .
well , i haven &apos;t done meth since i been here ,
but that &apos;s still my addiction .
why you always raggin &apos; on me , carmen ?

i &apos;ve never done drugs .
i &apos;ve had a couple beers .
well , callie , your addiction doesn &apos;t have to be drugs or alcohol .
i really ... don &apos;t know .
i feel like i have to tell you that i &apos;m addicted to something
so that i can get my privileges . but i &apos;d just be making it up .
why &apos;d you run away from your foster home ?
i kissed my foster brother .
oh , snap .
la la la . is he hot ?
so , you want your privileges so you can see your boyfriend ?
no . i need to see my little brother .
he needs to know why i left .
so , jude , i just got off the phone with rita at girls united .
girls united is the group home where callie is ,
and she gets to have visitors tomorrow for family day .

share callie just yet . ok ?
good night . the two of you don &apos;t stay up too late .
love you .
love you .
are you excited ?
yeah . i mean , i can &apos;t believe it .
you know what i can &apos;t believe ?
that i &apos;m doing homework on friday night .
i &apos;m so overwhelmed with the play .
and , i have a book report due on monday ,
and i haven &apos;t even started reading .
cool . where &apos;d you get it ?
can i borrow your lotion ?
on my shelf .
so , you run out on your brother
and you think that makes you some kind of martyr ?
group &apos;s over , becka .
you just turn on the water works
and you think you got us all fooled ?
well , not me .
you know what i think you are ?
a selfish bitch .
well , fortunately , i don &apos;t
care about the opinions of a drug addict .
um ... i &apos;m sorry .
get out !
get out !
all right , callie . why don &apos;t you go first . what happened ?
i accidentally walked in on cole in the bathroom .
i heard yelling .
i told her to get out .
and then what happened ?
nothing .
nothing ?
cole ?
i slipped on some water and fell back into the shower door .
wow . it was a pretty hard fall .
pretty wet floor .
girls , anybody see anything ?
nothing ?
well , callie , you know , we do have a solution
when two girls don &apos;t get along here in this house .
we make them roommates .
i wasn &apos;t sure if you had to dress up .
you look very handsome .
what &apos;s wrong ?
sweetheart , listen ,
it would seem that callie has lost her privileges .
so , she &apos;s not allowed to have visitors today .
why ? what &apos;d she do ?
we &apos;re not sure .
but , there was some kind of an altercation
with another girl last night ,
and rita thinks callie needs
a little more time to think about why she &apos;s there .
hey , you know what ?
brandon is at piano and mariana and jesus are busy ,
so why don &apos;t the three of us just do something fun ?
we could go to a movie ?
yeah . go biking ?
the aquarium ?
i ... actually have a lot of homework .
i think i just want to stay here , if that &apos;s ok .
of course .
whatever you want , hon .
just let us know if you change your mind .

guess what i found in my backpack ?
could it be a sexy , brown fedora ?
you could have gotten me arrested for shoplifting !
yeah , but i didn &apos;t
and now we have an awesome hat for chase .
we &apos;re not keeping it .
you snuck it out , you sneak it back in .
whoa , is that for me ?
yeah , it is .
sweet .
you look really hot in that hat .
totes . mariana , you &apos;re genius .
actually , i saw it first .
but , i carried it out of the store .
i mean , &apos; cause i thought it would help you create your character .
this hat is like the key to jim .
it &apos;s like flashy , but made of felt .
you know what i mean ?
totes .
i got to go show this off .
you &apos;re welcome .
one ! two !
three ! four !
nicely done ! nicely done ! let &apos;s go whales !
they let girls wrestle ?
not in my day . so , what do you think ?
doesn &apos;t seem that hard .
really ?
jesus , you wanna come on in , give it a try ?
just pop your shoes off for me , ok ?
circle up , everybody . this is jesus .
we are going to teach jesus about a basic breakdown .
that is a move that takes your opponent off his or her base ,
and drops them straight to the mat . ok ?
emma , why don &apos;t you come on in and take top position .
we &apos;ll do a tight waist , far ankle .
ready ?
nice effort .
hello ? cole , callie ,
you &apos;re welcome to join us downstairs for refreshments .
no , thanks .
is there ice cream ?
i think so . and chocolate sauce .
i &apos;m pretty sure i saw some of that too .
yes .
hey , i &apos;m really sorry you didn &apos;t get to see your brother today .
really ? is that why you
took away my privileges for no reason ?
callie .
i didn &apos;t see what happened between you and cole ,
but i &apos;m not stupid .
you don &apos;t get to act out and then run away from the consequences .
not in this house .
in fact , not anywhere in life .
the sooner you learn that ,
the better off you &apos;re gonna be .
is that it ?
that &apos;s it . and that &apos;s a lot .
so , think it over , all right ?
i hope you come down and join us .
