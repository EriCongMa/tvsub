we got a package from my dad .
no air holes in the box .
that &apos;s a good sign .
lily loved having that chicken .
one more time than she realized .
listen , i just got an e @-@ mail from our wedding singer .
he has a small request .
another one ?
since when does the wedding singer send us requests ?
well , no , he just wants to change a few songs in your medley
to avoid overlap with the stuff that he &apos;s performing .
well , i hope it &apos;s none of my showstoppers .
oh , they &apos;re all showstoppers .
oh , you &apos;re too kind .
oh , my gosh , it &apos;s us .
for our wedding cake .
couldn &apos;t you just die ?
i really think i could .
my dad made this .
he &apos;s a world @-@ class soap carver .
you know , once , when i was a kid , i cussed ,
and my mom washed my mouth out
with the leaning tower of pisa .
she still blames herself to this day .
oh , i would have nixed that wedding topper immediately ,
but cam and i have an agreement .
we -- we each got three vetoes of each other &apos;s wedding ideas --
no questions asked .
and it -- it worked for ... a while
i think you &apos;re gonna love my wedding board .
i &apos;m pretty excited , too .
veto .
veto .
veto .
veto .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m so emotional .
it &apos;s just the nicest thing ever .
you don &apos;t think that i look just a little bit --
i mean , my dad carved through his arthritis !
maybe it &apos;s the kicky leg .
i mean , the hours his ruined hands put into this .
he found us in soap .
today , mitchell , i know love .
i no love , either .
so , take your time looking around .
thanks .
i &apos;m helping gloria sell the old apartment
that she and manny lived in before she met jay .
it &apos;s in an up @-@ and @-@ coming neighborhood
with a distinct multicultural bent
that &apos;s undergoing an exciting urban renewal .
that &apos;s a fancy way of saying &quot; the gays found it . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe that i lived here for five years .
even turning the lights on was a pain .
look at this .
keep it down , you bitch !
ay . mrs. rivera &apos;s still alive .
i am really digging this place .
right ?
the gas stove , the moldings --
they don &apos;t make &apos; em like this anymore .
i &apos;ll probably gut it .
rip it out .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d do .
i want my contractor to swing by ,
but i really like it .
great . all right . thanks .
bye @-@ bye .
talk to you soon .
so nice to meet you .
i &apos;m not selling to him .
what ? really ?
he &apos;s a quality buyer .
you &apos;re tired of finding renters .
this is a family building .
generations have lived there ,
and usually at the same time .
he just wants to flip it .
okay .
i got a backup i can probably get here in an hour .
you want to wait in there ?
you walk in that door ,
you never come out .
no , no , not the bar -- the coffee shop .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
but we can wait next door .
that &apos;s my old hair salon where i used to work .
you can get drinks there , too .
gloria !
no , no , no , it &apos;s not jay .
what &apos;s so funny ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
she thinks you &apos;re my lover .
that is funny !
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s &quot; a room full of women laughing &quot; funny ,
but ...
ay , rita , no .
phil is a friend of mine ,
and we &apos;re just killing time before an appointment .
i hate to ask , gloria ,
but my new girl hasn &apos;t shown up .
any chance you could help ?
ay , of course !
it will be so much fun !
i don &apos;t want to ruin my nails .
phil , would you do my shampooing ?
well , i @-@ i guess so .
we &apos;ve got the time .
just a warning --
i haven &apos;t shampooed professionally since college ,
and that was only part @-@ time to pay for my cheer gear .
wow . that was super @-@ braggy .
what do we got , double sinks ?
what &apos;s the nozzle sitch ?
not to sound too braggy ,
but your mom was kind of
a badass at work this week .
it was hard enough with grandpa being sick
and me suddenly in charge ,
but it was just one crisis after another .
luke , honey , we &apos;re going !
fire in the warehouse ,
surprise inspection from osha ,
our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal ,
and i have to talk him off a ledge .
whatever . it &apos;s over now .
i don &apos;t want to bore you guys with this stuff .
so , when i get to work on wednesday ,
margaret is ready in tears ,
and there are two cops in the waiting room ,
and i say to them ,
&quot; one of you had better be able to drive an 18 @-@ wheeler ,
&quot; because i &apos;ve got 100 rosewood panels to get to victorville ,
or it &apos;s coming out of my paycheck . &quot;
i told you guys about the drivers and the bad tuna ?
bad tuna ,
yes .
yeah .
yes , i did .
hey , mom , i forgot how fun this car was .
and these automatic doors and that tv in the back .
you know what else was fun ?
the party they threw for me at work on friday .
i mean , it was a little bit embarrassing .
i didn &apos;t even know &quot; she @-@ ro &quot; was a word ,
and there it was , in icing .
hello , hello !
welcome to jay &apos;s night .
names , please .
want to make sure you &apos;re on the list .
kidding ! just excited .
appetizers on the bar ,
scrabble on the coffee table ,
and our feature presentation ,
&quot; the great escape . &quot;
speaking of which , haley ...
don &apos;t worry , grandpa .
i &apos;m not leaving .
i have no plans for the night .
me , either .
but when i say it , it &apos;s news .
when you say any complete sentence ,
it &apos;s news .
okay , girls . dad , you feeling better ?
you had a rough week , huh ?
nah . i &apos;m fine .
looks like you had a big week .
you heard about that ?
yeah , i got the blow @-@ by @-@ blow on all the office drama .
by the way , sincerely ...
yeah ?
... great ...
great guacamole on the bar , there .
wow . that &apos;s it ?
everything you did for him ,
and he doesn &apos;t even say &quot; thank you &quot; ?
i get it .
it &apos;s &quot; hero &quot; with a &quot; she . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m up to speed .
yeah , that was cold .
it &apos;s just his way .
after years of disappointment ,
i have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad .
he &apos;s not capable of it .
but it has taught me a very important lesson
that you girls should learn , too --
approval comes from within .
i knew that , mom .
&apos;course you did , &apos; cause you &apos;re smart .
hey , is lily out of the tub ?
we got to be at my dad &apos;s soon .
oh , no !
it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
we can be a little late .
no ! lily had the cake topper
in the tub with her !
oh , no . how could such a terrible mistake have occurred ?
i think she must have just thought it was a toy or something .
well , i hope it &apos;s not completely ruined forever .
oh , no . are you kidding me ?
my daddy uses a special shellac on this thing .
this is water @-@ resistant ,
heat @-@ resistant -- you name it .
good to know .
yeah , but put it someplace safe .
it could still be slippery ,
so be careful .
is it ?
oh , yeah , it is !
it &apos;s slippery !
is it okay ?
not a scratch .
apparently , i &apos;m tougher than i look .
hey , boys . having fun ?
you know it .
love us some jay &apos;s night .
okay , we &apos;re out of here .
kristy hughes ,
a.k.a. &quot; kristy huge ones , &quot;
is having a pool party two blocks away .
what about jay ?
he thinks we &apos;re at a party .
he &apos;ll never know .
we sneak out , work the room ,
cannonball , cannonball ,
and we &apos;re back in time for dinner .
were you even invited ?
no .
but that &apos;s only because i don &apos;t know her or any of her friends .
we &apos;re not invading her house .
besides , this hair at a pool party --
one dunk , and it goes off like an airbag .
what &apos;s this ? you made sauce ?
well , you were sick .
i didn &apos;t know if you could handle it .
back in vietnam , i had hepatitis .
still managed to cook thanksgiving dinner
for 300 soldiers .
i think i can handle sauce .
well , i saved you the trouble .
so , margaret tells me i &apos;m using some new delivery trucks now .
yeah . they &apos;re hybrid .
now , they cost a little more ,
but when i factored in the tax rebates
you get for going green ,
we come out ahead .
speaking of &quot; green , &quot;
you went a little heavy on the vegetables , huh ?
i &apos;m not sure i can stomach anything that &apos;s healthy .
gosh , mom , that truck thing sounds so amazing .
yeah !
it &apos;s fine , dad .
only do what we &apos;re capable of , right ?
oh , damn .
no , stella , stay . no .
good girl .
thank you , stella .
thank you for listening .
oh , i &apos;m so proud of you .
who &apos;s my best girl ?
don &apos;t .
okay , girls , we are ready for scrabble .
i &apos;ll grab some snacks .
uh , potato chips , please .
oh , so i can hear about how much
you hate yourself all night ?
hello , luke .
come on ! we &apos;ve got to go !
that party &apos;s full of sophomores .
those women have lived .
no , we &apos;re going back inside ,
we &apos;re eating jay &apos;s food ,
and we &apos;re playing his board games .
more like boring games .
they &apos;re already called &quot; board . &quot;
you don &apos;t make it more clever by --
never mind .
okay . thanks .
did you work everything out with the wedding singer ?
oh , yeah -- i &apos;m just dropping my big finale
because he &apos;s doing the same song .
&quot; my way &quot; ?
his way .
hey , guys .
sorry we &apos;re late ,
but we come with wine .
and whittlin &apos; !
check it out .
this is a beautiful gift my father made
for the top of our wedding cake .
i guess he ran out of soap before he got to me .
darn .
for you .
ladies , check out
your uncle mitch and cam in soap .
that &apos;s soap ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
this is my worst nightmare .
you shouldn &apos;t have blown through those vetoes .
this is how cam &apos;s dad sees me --
like some fawning damsel .
if anything , cam &apos;s the damsel .
dad !
thank you .
a lot can happen before the big day .
believe me , i &apos;ve already tried .
that thing is indestructible .
what if it went missing ?
things disappear around here all the time .
do they ?
all the time .
let &apos;s just say i have a friend
who helps me in these kinds of situations .
i &apos;m listening .
the less you know , the better .
i &apos;m not listening .
we never had this conversation .
this is a non @-@ versation .
right .
i am giving you the ... no @-@ ahead .
oh , i miss you girls .
nobody in my white family thinks that i am funny .
honey , hector had a life before he met you .
so i have to eat dinner with his ex ?
well , you certainly don &apos;t want him going alone --
not with his history .
who are you really mad at ?
ay , i don &apos;t know .
come on , luisa .
raul !
hector &apos;s going to hurt me just like raul did !
there it is .
but hector isn &apos;t raul , okay ?
they &apos;re just cousins .
we need to get a move on .
the client &apos;s gonna come over to the apartment at 4 : 00 .
i am swamped . i can &apos;t just leave .
gloria , we &apos;re here to sell your apartment .
we don &apos;t work at the salon .
muchísimas gracias , bianca .
no más texting ese hombre .
it &apos;s for a young couple with a baby on the way .
they &apos;re not flippers .
they &apos;re looking for a place to settle down and make a home .
okay , just move them .
if they really want it , they &apos;ll come back .
but , gloria --
ay , please , just help me with anna &apos;s foils .
i have a weave emergency !
something &apos;s not right .
qué qué pasó ?
no , no , no , not with you . you look great .
you know who &apos;s gonna hate this ,
is a certain jealous sister .
cinco de my , oh , my .
how am i supposed to do this with so many &quot; i &quot; s on my rack ?
sorry .
where &apos;s luke ?
how long does it take him to get the dictionary ?
we described it for him perfectly .
wait a minute .
he &apos;s not coming back .
ugh . move your &quot; s. &quot;
i @-@ i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
mitchell ! it &apos;s gone !
what is ?
the cake topper .
lily , have you seen the little daddies
you were bathing with earlier ?
don &apos;t say that .
i saw stella playing with it .
what ?
oh , look at her . she &apos;s all muddy .
she must have brought it outside and buried it .
she does it all the time !
oh , no . we have to go find it .
good luck .
that thing &apos;s as good as gone .
dang it !
and the worst part is ,
we don &apos;t even have a picture of it .
do we ?
okay , we can &apos;t give up .
let &apos;s go out into the yard and look for it .
careful . i wouldn &apos;t come between stella
and anything she &apos;s buried .
she &apos;s a wild animal .
no telling what she &apos;ll do .
that &apos;s a very aggressive stance .
luke ! wait !
oh . look at that .
you left your yard ,
and your little shock collar didn &apos;t go off .
luke --
okay , so , here &apos;s the new plan .
you hang back while i break the ice ,
and then , when the time is right --
manny ! you made it !
who &apos;s this ?
&quot; who &apos;s this ? &quot;
excuse me ,
kristy huge ones , i have a name .
okay , come on . stop .
i &apos;m tired of chasing you all day .
then don &apos;t .
stay as long as you want at that lame party .
you want to talk ?
you &apos;re the dorky sidekick , not me .
want to talk nicer ?
how could you be invited and i wasn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s like the stuff that used to make me kind of weird ,
people are starting to like .
so ?
i &apos;m the same as i always was .
well ... maybe you could upgrade a little .
uh , we &apos;re tired of the yoda voice ,
and if a girl tells you she went to london ,
maybe don &apos;t ask if she also saw france .
i liked things better when you were the one
who was ostrich @-@ sized .
what ?
you know , like a freaky outsider --
the way an ostrich feels around regular birds .
you know what else girls like ?
the mysterious , silent type .
what are you doing with my sauce , there , cookie ?
that &apos;s yours .
this is mine .
i prepped it this morning .
i figured , why not make it ?
um ... maybe because i already made sauce ?
can &apos;t have too much .
can &apos;t ya ?
hand me that ladle , huh ?
what are you doing ? i got it .
what do you say ?
what ?
what do you say when somebody does something for you ?
what do you say ?
you want me to thank you for handing me a ladle ?
you thanked the dog for staying --
which is basically doing nothing --
so i know you know the words .
fine .
thank you for handling me the ladle .
you sure those are ready ?
you didn &apos;t throw one against the wall .
oh , dad , nobody does that anymore .
oh . i guess we have new ways for doing everything now , huh ?
no . i didn &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m just saying that you can taste your food
instead of flinging it at the wall like a chimp .
okay .
how &apos;s it taste ?
actually , mm , that &apos;s pretty good .
but it could use a little ,
um ... sauce .
let me just -- ooh , hot .
try a little parmesan with that ?
i should probably get that bread in the oven .
just ...
okay ! hey !
hey , how about we take over in here
while you two get cleaned up for dinner ?
yes , good idea .
yeah . okay .
approval comes from within .
thank you .
your sauce needs garlic .
okay .
okay .
and that &apos;s a clock .
okay , well , do another one .
i &apos;ve done like four .
this dog is a worse hoarder than your uncle clayton .
he &apos;s a collector .
of expired yogurt ?
getting tired .
cam , can we just stop , please ?
i feel like we &apos;ve done our best ,
but we &apos;re just not gonna find it .
found it !
oh ! good .
thank god .
i hadn &apos;t even told you my biggest plan for this yet .
bigger than the top of our wedding cake ?
i &apos;m gonna have a mold made of it and give a reproduction
to everyone who comes to the wedding
and everyone who can &apos;t come to the wedding .
imagine hundreds of these across the country .
no !
no ! no ! absolutely not !
i hate it ! it &apos;s awful !
i knew it !
i knew it !
it just shows up in lily &apos;s bath ,
and then , all of a sudden , the dog has it ?
you have it in for this beautiful topper .
look at this . look at it . look at it !
come on , you &apos;re all heroic and paul bunyan @-@ y ,
and i &apos;m -- i &apos;m , like , some sissy man
with -- with pinkish cheeks and a turned @-@ out heel .
it &apos;s a caricature .
what matters is what it represents .
my daddy making this for us
means he &apos;s accepted us for who we are !
don &apos;t you get that ?
i never really thought about it that way .
no . you hadn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just being sensitive .
i need to have a thicker skin .
i @-@ i &apos;m really , really sorry .
no , don &apos;t -- don &apos;t -- don &apos;t be sorry .
no .
and i -- n-- i don &apos;t want something at the wedding
that makes you uncomfortable .
well , no , that doesn &apos;t seem fair .
i &apos;ve used up all my vetoes .
well , if it --
i guess , if it makes you feel better ,
i could give you one more veto --
if you give me one more , too .
okay , sure .
and in the future ,
if there &apos;s anything --
the wedding singer .
okay . thanks , daddy .
i &apos;ll send you the perfect picture to model it on .
after today , i &apos;m convinced
our landfills are 10 % hair .
oh , yes .
i forgot how exhausting this is .
well , all we have to do
is meet the clients back at the apartment ,
and then we can head home .
ay , no . i &apos;m too tired now .
let &apos;s reschedule .
really ? again ?
yes . let &apos;s meet them next week .
and besides , we &apos;re late for jay &apos;s party .
well , i &apos;m not letting you go home looking like this .
you &apos;re a little ratty back here .
ay , no .
no , no , no . i got it .
you just relax .
what a day , huh ?
being back here must bring up a lot of memories .
oh , yeah .
maybe even some emotions .
yeah . it feels weird .
no , weird &apos;s an adjective ,
not an emotion , but go on .
well , it &apos;s just that my life now is so different than before --
so much easier .
and that makes you feel ... ?
good .
and also ... ?
and bad .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on , now , gloria .
i don &apos;t know .
i guess it just makes me feel a little ashamed .
now , what in the world do you have to be ashamed of ?
it &apos;s just that , you know ,
before , when i used to live here ,
i used to work for every penny .
i would stand on my own two feet .
now i just stand on expensive shoes
that jay buys for me .
is that why it &apos;s so hard to let go of the apartment ?
no , phil , it &apos;s not that --
gloria .
maybe .
gloria .
yes .
it &apos;s the last piece of the old me .
no , no ! you &apos;re going too deep !
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , but i think you &apos;re looking at this all wrong .
the old you hasn &apos;t gone anywhere .
i @-@ i @-@ i see it in the way you &apos;re raising manny and joe ,
the way you care for jay .
you never take anyone or anything for granted .
you worked hard for years
without knowing that things were gonna get better .
and then the universe rewarded you .
there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
so you &apos;re not mad at me
because i don &apos;t want to sell the apartment ?
no .
you &apos;ll know when you &apos;re ready ,
and i &apos;ll be here .
aw , phil .
you &apos;re the best .
there &apos;s no one like you .
claire , that looks so good .
i can &apos;t wait to try it .
thank you .
something has happened here .
well , you &apos;ll all be happy to know
that our search for the cake topper
unearthed a number of family treasures .
come on , cam . we &apos;re eating over here .
wait .
didn &apos;t i give you this for father &apos;s day ?
and that .
you see how this dog is ?
my karaoke microphone .
jay , check it out !
the other walkie @-@ talkie !
shame on you , jay pritchett !
you have used this dog to bury the things that you hate .
what ?
yeah !
since when do you need help burying things ?
calm down . she buries stuff of mine , too . look .
everybody at the office bought me this clock last month .
honey , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
that &apos;s a question that maybe you should answer .
oh , my gosh ! my headphones !
that &apos;s the worst .
&quot; here &apos;s to 40 years in the business .
enjoy your new timer , old @-@ timer . &quot;
suddenly , it made sense .
in my dad &apos;s mind ,
i was reaching for a torch he wasn &apos;t ready to pass .
sure , someday ,
i &apos;m gonna take over his business ,
but not tonight .
tonight is still jay &apos;s night .
so , dad ...
turns out ,
i did have a bunch of questions for you last week ,
but i didn &apos;t want to bother you with them .
i didn &apos;t want you to think i couldn &apos;t handle it .
there &apos;s no shame in asking for help .
you can always call .
well , i won &apos;t need to .
you &apos;ll be in the office down the hall , right ?
right .
goldilocks to papa bear .
goldilocks to papa bear .
come in , papa bear .
this is papa bear .
on location in the garage , papa bear .
got some cocoa with your name on it .
what &apos;s your 20 ?
oh , what the hell ?
what &apos;s going on ?
the kids unfriended me again .
how am i supposed to know what &apos;s going on in their lives
if they never talk to me ?
honey ...
i got this .
yeah . it &apos;s been kind of a rough year .
new school ,
new kids ,
and now i &apos;m taking advice about girls
from a kid who has his own shoe buffer .
what ? !
i tried beer .
wow , dad . this feels great .
good . good .
you &apos;re-- you sure there &apos;s --
there &apos;s nothing on your mind ?
no .
why do you ask , dad ?
you seem upset about something .
it &apos;s just , you reach a certain age ,
and you start to wonder ,
&quot; am i everything i wanted to be ? &quot;
i mean , am i selling houses ,
or am i just selling out ?
anything else ?
