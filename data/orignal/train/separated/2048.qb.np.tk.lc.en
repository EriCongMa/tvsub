you took a case on contingency
where every plaintiff is dirt poor .
dump it .
one of the victims was my uncle keith .
please , these people need your help .
they need someone like you to fight for them ,
and i can &apos;t do it .
then what do you say we do it together ?
i &apos;d like to propose a change to
the current compensation formula .
how many partners do you have in your pocket
if we put your proposal to a vote ?
i can get 45 % .
i &apos;m gonna get you the difference .
this is harvey &apos;s last three income statements ,
and i found them sitting in the copy machine .
you came to work for me ,
so now it &apos;s time for you to decide .
are you with me or not ?
i just called for a vote tomorrow ,
and i hope you &apos;ve been saving your money ,
because your gravy train &apos;s about to leave the station .
oh , hello .
i was just ...
working .
i see that , but it &apos;s 7 : 30 in the morning .
what are you doing here so early ?
i like to get in before the chaos starts .
tell you the truth , i was under the impression
that you wouldn &apos;t get in till much later .
i wanted to get a jump on the day .
then maybe you should get a jump on this .
why am i paying louis &apos;s laundry bill ?
because if you pay it ,
he won &apos;t know that we triple @-@ starched all of his shirts .
we ?
yes , we .
he came after us . we &apos;re coming after him .
did you think i wouldn &apos;t have your back ?
you want the truth ?
i thought you &apos;d be asking for a raise
after seeing how much i make .
i didn &apos;t look at how much you make .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
anyone who did should be fired .
you &apos;re all right , gretchen .
but for the time being ,
don &apos;t play any more jokes on louis .
mind if i ask why ?
because i only play jokes on people
to express my affection for them ,
and right now i have no affection for louis litt .
looks like i got here just in time .
and why is that ?
because i &apos;m going to ask you to do something
you &apos;re not going to want to do ,
only this time you &apos;re going to do it .
what didn &apos;t i do last time ?
i told you to apologize to louis .
and i did , right before he held hands with jack soloff
and cut my earnings in front of the entire firm .
and if you hadn &apos;t have been such a dick to jack
in the first place ,
louis would have had nowhere to go .
this isn &apos;t about louis , is it ?
no , it isn &apos;t .
i want you to bury the hatchet with jack .
you mean you want me to kiss his ass .
i mean i want you to figure out a way
to make peace with a partner whose influence is on the rise .
that &apos;s kissing his ass .
well , if that &apos;s how you want to look at it ,
then pucker up , because that man is a threat ,
and he &apos;s aligned with louis ,
and i am in no mood for a power struggle .
i didn &apos;t hear you leave today .
that &apos;s because i left at 5 : 00 in the morning ,
trying to get an early start on this case .
about that ...
i didn &apos;t want to say anything last night
because you were so excited--
but you &apos;re worried about me working with your father .
yes .
mike , you &apos;re the two most important men in my life .
neither of you back down from a fight ,
and i &apos;m just--
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna end up hating each other .
rachel , do you hate your father ?
of course not . i love my dad .
and don &apos;t you have conflicts with him all the time ?
yes , i do , but it &apos;s different .
he &apos;s my family .
yeah , he &apos;s gonna be my family too .
and if i &apos;m lucky , i &apos;m gonna fight with him
about a lot of things over the years .
so why not start with a fight
where we &apos;re both on the same side ?
okay , i trust you .
good .
jessica , you have a minute ?
i do if you &apos;re here to tell me
why robert zane is sitting in the lobby
with an appointment to see you .
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s not taking time
out of his busy morning to talk about centerpieces .
no , he &apos;s not .
he is here to co @-@ counsel the kelton case .
you mean the case i explicitly told you to drop ?
i mean the case that you said would cost a fortune to fund
and you didn &apos;t wanna lay out that kind of money for .
i didn &apos;t want to lay it out because this case is a loser .
and i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not .
and even if it is , i just took away our downside .
by going behind my back to our biggest competitor .
are you telling me that you &apos;re scared of robert zane ?
i &apos;d be a fool if i wasn &apos;t .
and you &apos;re a fool if you &apos;re not .
we let that man into our house ,
there &apos;s no telling what he &apos;ll do .
you know what , jessica ?
if harvey had done this , you &apos;d be pissed ,
but you &apos;d let him do it anyway .
and you may be as cocky as him ,
but you are not harvey .
no , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i guess i &apos;ll just go tell robert
that we won &apos;t be working together on this after all .
you know damn well if we tell him that now ,
i look weak .
so maybe i am as good as harvey .
well , sometimes that &apos;s not a good thing .
where are you going ?
to get some goddamn strength back .
then go ahead and do it .
i won &apos;t just take you to the woodshed .
i &apos;ll leave you there , dead .
well , looks like you &apos;re making yourself comfortable
in my offices .
about as comfortable as possible in these chairs .
you ever hear of lumbar support ?
i get it . you like stodgy and functional .
but these are my chairs ,
just like this is my case .
what exactly are you doing here , jessica ?
i &apos;m here to tell you we &apos;re taking half the contingency .
and i &apos;m here to respond . i &apos;m giving you 1 / 3 .
we brought this case to you .
after you found it in a box crying for its mama .
plus , i &apos;m footing the bill ,
which means this fee discussion is over .
well , this fee discussion may be over ,
but the power discussion is just getting started .
you don &apos;t give a shit about the money , do you ?
on this particular case ,
all i give a shit about is keeping you in check .
which means , for the duration of this matter ,
you will be treating mike ross like a partner .
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
that boy barely shaves .
i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s still in diapers .
he &apos;s representing my firm ,
which means he &apos;s representing me .
you look at him , you see me .
you &apos;re asking for a hell of a lot .
then take your wingtips off my table
and walk &apos; em out the door ,
because this is my case
and you either do it my way or you don &apos;t do it at all .
i love you .
louis , it &apos;s not my birthday .
i know , but i know that you weren &apos;t happy
with the position i put you in
regarding harvey &apos;s compensation ,
so i just wanted to make sure that you and i were okay .
actually , you wanna know the truth ?
right at this second , i &apos;m not okay .
then please tell me ,
what can i do to make it okay ?
you can start by never putting me
in a position like that again .
i won &apos;t .
jack , i need to talk to you .
sure , louis , what can i do for you ?
well , you can consider me out of your war with harvey .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m saying that i don &apos;t like what i did ,
and from now on , i don &apos;t want anything to do with it .
fine by me , louis .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , i won my war with harvey .
this is your office ?
why do you say it like that ?
like what ?
with disgust .
&apos;cause harvey &apos;s got autographed basketballs
and vintage records ,
and you &apos;ve got a photograph of a guy &apos;s shoes .
well , you better be careful
or sergeant hulka with the big toe
is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass .
what the hell are you talking about ?
stripes .
i &apos;m just quoting stripes .
it &apos;s a movie .
harvey and i do this all the time .
look , i don &apos;t know what kind of teenage nonsense
you got going on with him , but i don &apos;t do that shit .
okay .
i &apos;m going to visit the facility .
meet you down in the lobby in ten .
i take it that means that things went well with jessica ?
yep , she signed off , and all i had to do was
agree to treat you as a full and equal partner .
whoa , that must have hurt .
eh , it didn &apos;t hurt a bit , &apos; cause i didn &apos;t mean it with her ,
and i &apos;m not gonna do it with you .
see you in 10 .
better make that 15 .
heard you &apos;re looking for me .
i was , because i wanted to give you this .
what &apos;s that ?
directions to westchester country club .
why are you giving them to me ?
because i don &apos;t want you to be late to your 11 : 30 tee time
with charles barkley .
i &apos;m playing golf with charles barkley ?
if you get there on time , you are .
if not and he starts whacking at shit with his big club ,
he might kill someone .
you &apos;ll miss the whole thing .
you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ?
you &apos;re sucking up to me &apos; cause all of a sudden
you realized i &apos;m someone to be reckoned with .
that is what i &apos;m doing .
but you &apos;re a big golfer and a bigger barkley fan ,
and i thought we could use this to get off to a fresh start .
here &apos;s the problem , harvey .
i don &apos;t give a shit about charles barkley ,
and you don &apos;t give a shit about me .
listen to me . this is a gesture .
take it .
i &apos;m not gonna take it ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell you why .
because you &apos;ve never treated me like a peer .
you &apos;ve only ever treated me like competition .
i &apos;m trying very hard here .
well , you can stop trying , because i &apos;m not interested .
mr. specter , i swear he told me
he was a huge charles barkley fan .
i &apos;m sure he did , but the problem is he lied ,
and you should &apos;ve known it .
whatever you &apos;re doing , put it back .
i need you .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t ? we &apos;re about to go to war .
i mean , i &apos;m about to go to war myself .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m taking a case against kelton insurance .
i gotta go meet the client right now .
who the hell authorized that ?
jessica .
you went to jessica instead of me ?
i didn &apos;t go to anyone , all right ?
she came to me after i took it .
well , i &apos;m telling you , you &apos;re gonna have to postpone it .
harvey , this case is important .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s important .
i got a partner at this firm coming at me .
well , i didn &apos;t know that when i committed to this .
what the hell ? i thought we were meeting in the lobby .
you gotta be kidding me . your case is with him ?
you &apos;re damn right it &apos;s with me .
and we have a first impression to make .
i don &apos;t know what kind of law you &apos;re teaching around here ,
but where i come from , you show up on time .
let &apos;s go .
you wanna go ?
go .
jessica , what can i do for you ?
you came to me for some legal advice .
now i &apos;m coming to you for yours .
do i get to charge you for it ?
you already do , unless you suddenly
started paying for law school out of your own pocket .
free of charge it is .
i want you to look this over
and tell me if we have any exposure .
okay , but this isn &apos;t a deal .
this is a speech .
i &apos;m aware of that ,
but gwen barnes is quite opinionated ,
and i don &apos;t want her to say something
that might get her sued .
dr. gwendolyn barnes ?
do you have a problem with her ?
no , not at all . how much time do i have ?
take as long as you want .
just make sure whenever i come back for it ,
it &apos;s done .
what are you doing in here ?
i came to apologize .
you don &apos;t need to apologize .
i was out of line .
soloff &apos;s an asshole , and it wasn &apos;t your fault .
no , you were right . it was my fault .
well , what &apos;s done is done .
if you don &apos;t mind , i need to think right now .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. specter , but what &apos;s done is not done .
what are you talking about ?
i told you , i got your back .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s the bio of that asshole &apos;s third biggest client .
and ?
look where he &apos;s from .
i appreciate you coming all the way down here ,
but the last time you came to me ,
you told me to sit tight , and that was a week ago .
emma , i don &apos;t understand .
what did you expect ?
i expected you to understand what it feels like
to be left hanging .
because if we can &apos;t understand that ,
what &apos;s to stop us from cutting and running
when things get tough ?
and what is gonna stop you ?
i know what &apos;s gonna stop me .
first year ... you think about it every day .
you relive it .
doesn &apos;t matter what you do .
you can &apos;t get it out of your head .
people tell you it &apos;s part of god &apos;s plan .
maybe they &apos;re right , but it doesn &apos;t stop you
from wanting to punch them in the face
every time they say it .
then time passes ,
two , three years .
maybe you even start to feel normal .
maybe you start to believe that
maybe this thing won &apos;t actually
scar you for the rest of your life .
but then one day ,
something reminds you .
a song or a ... or a smell .
and it touches that nerve , and all of a sudden ,
it &apos;s the day you got that news all over again .
so you have gone through something like this yourself ?
i haven &apos;t just gone through it .
it &apos;s the entire reason that i became a lawyer .
and as far as it taking as long as it did ,
it took a while to work out the particulars .
but i can assure you ,
it &apos;s worth the wait ,
because this right here ,
this is an all @-@ star team , and we &apos;re playing for you .
well ...
where do i sign ?
all right , we got that taken care of .
next step ?
set up a settlement conference .
got that right .
you mean &quot; you got that right , partner . &quot;
what the hell are you talking about ?
you &apos;re the one that said it yourself .
you and me , we &apos;re the all @-@ star team .
i meant i was the all @-@ star . you &apos;re the team .
oh , so i guess in this case the team
just hit the game @-@ winning jumper .
i got news for you , team ,
the game hasn &apos;t even started yet .
mike , seriously , back there ,
about your childhood , i didn &apos;t really get it before .
you got dealt a bad hand ,
and you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps ,
and i respect that .
thanks , robert .
you can call me &quot; dad . &quot;
really ?
no .
so you know we &apos;re talking about my father , right ,
who &apos;s no longer alive ?
yeah , i forgot that .
you forgot that ?
the basis of your compliment in the first place ?
you suck the fun out of everything , don &apos;t you ?
you did this quickly .
you gave me a job to do , and i did it .
and why did you leave it on my desk
instead of bringing it to me directly ?
i just wanted to give you a chance to look it over .
and does that have something to do with the fact
that i asked you to check it for exposure
and not rewrite it ?
i know , i may have overstepped my assignment .
it &apos;s just dr. barnes is the first black female
chief of surgery at a major new york hospital .
she faced discrimination at every turn ,
and she still got the job done ,
so she doesn &apos;t need soaring language to communicate that .
i &apos;ll tell dr. barnes you said that .
so you &apos;re accepting my changes ?
i &apos;ll present them to her with my blessing .
we &apos;ll see what she thinks .
jessica , um ...
if you ever have a case with dr. barnes ,
i would love to be a part of it .
i have a better idea .
why don &apos;t you come to the speech with me ?
that is exactly why we need to figure out a way
to get you on the board of directors of comcast .
from your lips to god &apos;s ears .
jack , i &apos;m sorry . can i speak to you for a second ?
uh , we &apos;re kind of in the middle of something .
it &apos;ll only take a minute . it &apos;s firm business .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not optional .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
harvey specter , by the way ,
of pearson specter .
this will only take a second .
you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ?
you &apos;re trying to poach my client .
what makes you think i &apos;m trying to do that ?
please , &quot; harvey specter of pearson specter . &quot;
let me tell you something ,
guy &apos;s been my client for ten years .
he &apos;s not leaving me for the likes of you .
then i guess our business here is done .
what the hell is going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on . you &apos;re free .
in fact , i &apos;ll walk you back .
oh , look at that .
is that charles barkley taking a selfie
with your loyal client who happened to have grown up
in philadelphia during the barkley era ?
look , you might not give a shit about charles ,
but he sure as hell does .
you son of a bitch .
i &apos;m sorry , jack . could you repeat that ?
i couldn &apos;t hear you over the sound of me taking your client .
then let me say it louder . this isn &apos;t over .
it better be , because you &apos;ve got four other clients
from chicago , boston , los angeles , and houston .
and you may not know who those famous ballers are ,
but i do .
will , jennifer ,
thank you for seeing us on such short notice .
well , you did serve our client with a lawsuit .
nevertheless , we have an offer for you .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
you called us all the way down here for this ?
i wouldn &apos;t wipe my ass with this .
well , robert , we don &apos;t look at it that way .
how exactly do you look at it , will ?
we look at it as a gift to a couple of vultures
trying to pick the flesh off the bones of an old case .
that is what every lawyer
who has had something to hide has ever said .
and it doesn &apos;t change the fact
that your client killed 200 people .
then we &apos;re gonna tell you what we told the last attorney .
you go to trial , you &apos;ll be buried in paperwork
for the next ten years .
well , if this were yesterday ,
then we might be rattled by that .
but since then , new information has come to light .
and what new information is that ?
this is a list of everyone who works at my firm .
and this is a list of everyone that works at mine .
you see , we &apos;re not some solo practitioner
with a part @-@ time paralegal working out of a mall .
what my associate is getting at is
we &apos;re two huge law firms ,
perfectly designed to kick your ass .
i don &apos;t care how many people work at your firms .
someone needs to pay their salaries .
and if you &apos;re working on this ,
you &apos;re not doing that .
then doesn &apos;t it come in handy
to have a $ 20 @-@ billion hedge fund footing the bill ?
so you can either add a bunch of zeroes to this bullshit offer ,
or we &apos;ll see you in court .
mind if i ask you a question ?
if it &apos;s about using my connections
to get stevie wonder to play at your wedding ,
i already tried .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about the hedge fund ?
well , what difference does it make
where we get our money from ?
it doesn &apos;t make a difference ,
except for the fact you didn &apos;t tell me .
what are you getting so bent out of shape for ?
we landed a punch back there .
we landed a punch or you did ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
first you call me &quot; associate &quot; in front of opposing counsel ,
and now i find out you &apos;re keeping things from me .
look--
i &apos;m just saying , are we a team or not ?
i called you what i called you in there
because they want to see someone in charge .
and looking at the two of us , they &apos;re gonna think it &apos;s me .
and i didn &apos;t think about telling you about arcadian
because i came up with that when you weren &apos;t there .
for the record , i had the same idea .
i went to a hedge fund before i even came to you .
well , congratulations .
if you had closed them like i closed my guys ,
i wouldn &apos;t be standing here explaining myself .
so let &apos;s talk when we hear back from these clowns .
and put a smile on your face . you kicked ass in there .
jack , what can i do for you ?
you can get your dog on a leash .
excuse me ?
harvey just stole one of my clients .
i want him back .
do you have proof ?
yeah , he orchestrated some bullshit run @-@ in
with charles barkley ,
and miraculously my client , he needs to make a change .
well , that &apos;s not proof .
i don &apos;t need proof . i know what the hell he did .
just like i know what you and louis did
to pass your compensation resolution .
and if i had proof of that ,
we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
we &apos;d be having your exit interview .
you gonna sling accusations at me ,
or you gonna get your dog harvey under control ?
&apos;cause if you can &apos;t control him ,
maybe you shouldn &apos;t be in control of this firm .
control him ?
let me tell you something , jack .
when you went after harvey , you went after me ,
which is why i &apos;m the one
that sent him after you in the first place .
and i just put more money in every other partner &apos;s pocket ,
which means you better listen to me when i talk .
there &apos;s only so many times you can pull some shady shit
to get something done with the partners .
so you want to take me on ?
i &apos;m right here .
what are you working on ?
the kelton case .
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you ,
how &apos;s it going with my dad ?
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s , uh-- it &apos;s going fine .
mm @-@ hmm , it &apos;s fine .
i know what &quot; it &apos;s fine &quot; means .
&quot; it &apos;s fine &quot; means it &apos;s not fine ,
and you &apos;re realizing that i was right
and you were wrong ,
and he is a giant pain in the ass .
rachel , i never said there wouldn &apos;t be arguments .
i just said ultimately they &apos;d bring us closer .
i know , you did .
i &apos;m not trying to cause trouble .
i was just trying to be charming and delightful .
thanks .
it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s important to me that your dad respects me .
if there is one thing that i am certain of ,
it &apos;s that my father respects you .
okay ?
harvey , you were right .
that &apos;s one of the best steaks i ever had .
how about you tell me why you actually brought me here ?
can &apos;t a man just take his client out to dinner ?
a man can , but you need something ,
and i just did you that little favor .
that wasn &apos;t a favor .
i took 15 minutes of pictures with some dipshit from philadelphia .
that &apos;s not a favor ?
that was an appetizer .
i need you to get magic , bird ,
hakeem , and michael
to do the same thing .
you &apos;re a funny guy . you &apos;re kidding , right ?
did i ask you if you were kidding me
when you called me that night ?
you asked me to sign with you , and i did .
and i also said that i would need something from you someday ,
and taking selfies with some dipshit sixers fan
isn &apos;t gonna cut it .
harvey , you need to chill with this soloff thing .
if not , every single day you go into the office ,
he &apos;s gonna be trying to stab you in the back .
i &apos;m not here to get your advice , charles .
i &apos;m here to get you to help me .
i &apos;m not getting the dream team back together .
it can happen if you make it happen .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
and the harvey i know would never ask me to do it .
listen , leave a big tip .
people think i &apos;m paying for the meal .
put down whatever you &apos;re doing .
we need to talk .
you &apos;re talking to a name partner ,
so i suggest you do it with a little respect .
i &apos;m showing respect by coming to you
to hit harvey where it hurts .
i told you , i don &apos;t want anything to do
with your war with harvey .
you already have something to do with it .
and you said you didn &apos;t care if i backed out .
i don &apos;t give a shit what i said .
you picked a side . there &apos;s no going back .
absolutely not .
i &apos;m not doing it . this is way too far , jack .
no , it &apos;s what we should have done in the first place .
well , you know , it doesn &apos;t even matter ,
because you can &apos;t introduce a resolution like this ,
&apos;cause it violates the bylaws .
then you need to do some underhanded shit
to make it unviolate the bylaws .
and i already told you
that i &apos;m not doing anything like that again .
too bad , because you did it once .
and if you don &apos;t want me telling anybody about it ,
you &apos;ll do it again .
good morning , louis .
well , looks like you &apos;ve been busy .
i have .
here &apos;s the crenshaw depo ,
and this is the kirsch itinerary ,
and here &apos;s your music box .
why are you giving my gift back ?
because it was a gift you gave me with a promise
never to put me in a position like that again .
and i haven &apos;t .
but you will .
and don &apos;t tell me you won &apos;t ,
because i overheard your little scheme with jack soloff .
then you obviously heard me tell him to go to hell .
no , louis , i heard him tell you
that you &apos;re in this war whether you like it or not .
and then he walked out that door ,
and you didn &apos;t say a damn thing .
i swear i &apos;m gonna keep my promise .
i am not going after harvey .
you think this is about me protecting harvey ?
this is about me protecting me .
what are you talking about ?
harvey came to me the other night
to get me to admit that i knew what you did .
he came to you ?
in my home .
and i had to stand there and lose my integrity
in front of him for you .
oh , my god , he &apos;s really doing it .
doing what ?
after the compensation vote ,
harvey and i got into a fight ,
and i told him that i &apos;d just taken away
the one thing he values most :
his money .
he then tells me that he &apos;s gonna come
after the one thing that i value most .
me .
yes .
told me that one day i would come to this office ,
you &apos;d be gone ,
and i &apos;d know that it was him who took you away from me .
he said he was gonna take me away ?
listen to me .
i swear i will never do that to you again .
but please do not leave me .
i &apos;m not leaving you , louis .
you get this ?
sure did . motion to dismiss .
yeah . you know what this means , right ?
we got &apos; em on the ropes . they &apos;re scared .
which is why i scheduled a hearing
with judge hernandez for tomorrow morning .
she &apos;s gonna dismiss this bullshit ,
and i &apos;m gonna get her to move straight to trial .
uh , robert , that &apos;s a bad idea .
what are you talking about ?
they throw a jab , we answer with a right cross .
yes , if we go to trial now , we get a decision ,
but if we go in three months , we get a knockout .
what the hell are you talking about ?
there &apos;s a bill on the governor &apos;s desk
waiting to be passed .
it lifts the cap on punitive damages .
there &apos;s a reason he hasn &apos;t signed it yet .
the a.m.a. is up his ass .
we go now .
the c.e.o. of kelton insurance &apos;s contract is up .
he doesn &apos;t want to be renegotiating
while he &apos;s on the front page of the journal
being accused of killing people .
that threat takes these people
from $ 1,000 per person to $ 5,000,
but if we actually go to trial--
if we go to trial , we may get nothing .
and i &apos;m finished having this conversation .
so now i see where we stand . we &apos;re not partners .
i &apos;m just the associate .
you &apos;re the one calling the shots .
i thought i made that clear
from the second we started this thing .
now answer this motion , get my motion done ,
and be in court tomorrow morning ,
because this is gonna happen whether you like it or not .
oh--what the hell ?
what the hell what ?
you spilled my coffee .
you ran into me .
i don &apos;t care who ran into who .
this is my office . how about a little &quot; excuse me &quot; ?
oh , okay , harvey . excuse me .
feel free to send me the bill for dry cleaning .
i &apos;m paying for everything else around here .
donna , now is not a good time .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m not a prize to be used to get revenge on louis .
what the hell are you talking about ?
are you gonna deny you told him
that you were gonna take me back ?
that is not what i said .
no , do not lawyer me ,
because it may not be exactly what you said ,
but don &apos;t try to tell me it wasn &apos;t what you meant .
donna ...
and another thing , what makes you think
if i were ever to leave louis
that i would ever , ever come back to you ?
mr. specter , i know this is a bad time ,
but i have to remind you that--
i know ! jessica wants to see me .
donna , hey , can i talk to you for a second ?
it &apos;s actually not a good time right this second .
it &apos;s important .
i just need to know
if harvey is still tight with judge hernandez .
why ?
i need her to postpone a hearing for me .
you know what , mike ?
if you want something from harvey ,
you &apos;re gonna have to ask him yourself .
you wanted to see me ?
that was 12 hours ago .
i was putting some things in order .
what things in order ,
stealing more of jack soloff &apos;s clients ?
as a matter of fact , yes .
god damn it , harvey .
jessica , i went in there . i tried to make peace .
he spat in my face .
i tried again . he did it again .
and i said , &quot; enough is enough . &quot;
then you walk out the door . you don &apos;t steal his clients .
you know what ? this doesn &apos;t concern you .
this is between me and jack .
oh , it was between you and jack until he came to me ,
and i had to cover for you .
you covered for me ?
goddamn right i did .
i told him sending you after him was my idea
in the first place .
that &apos;s not covering for me .
that &apos;s covering for you ,
because that should have been your idea in the first place ,
instead of welcoming every competitor we have
into our offices behind my back .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about robert zane
and you bringing him in here without consulting me .
i didn &apos;t bring in shit .
mike ross brought zane in without asking ,
and i had to pretend to be on board with that too .
and now you &apos;re hoping this leads to what you always wanted .
this thing &apos;s over , zane goes ,
and mike heads out the door with him .
that &apos;s enough .
you need to get yourself under control right now .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about you have a problem ,
and it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
and you just expose it by bringing up
some paranoid bullshit about mike ross
going with robert zane .
because this all started when donna left you ,
and now you &apos;re afraid that mike &apos;s going to do the same thing .
so you better get your abandonment issues under control ,
because jack soloff is gonna keep coming ,
and now you &apos;re gonna have to put him down .
mr. specter ,
mike ross is waiting for you in your office .
hey , i need to talk to you .
not now .
i know you &apos;re mad from before , but i need a favor .
i said not now .
harvey , what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing &apos;s wrong . i need a glass of water .
what the hell is going on ?
okay , i &apos;m dialing 911 .
no , you &apos;re not .
yes , i am . you could be having a heart attack .
it &apos;s not a heart attack .
you don &apos;t know that .
it &apos;s a panic attack .
oh , hate to interrupt a special moment ,
but i thought you might wanna take a gander at this .
what the hell is that ?
if you recall , our last proposal
reduced contingent compensation .
this one wipes it out altogether .
what &apos;s the matter ? no snappy comeback ?
i &apos;ve read the bylaws . you can &apos;t do that .
you doing his fighting for him now ?
i don &apos;t care what the bylaws say .
i have louis &apos;s backing .
so either you give back my client ,
or good luck billing 2,500 hours a year
like the rest of us .
you go right ahead and put your proposal to a vote .
but by the time this thing passes ,
i &apos;ll have your other four clients .
bullshit , you couldn &apos;t have gotten to them already .
go goddamn check . they &apos;re already in play .
you pass this thing ,
you won &apos;t be billing anything at all .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with that .
wrong . i didn &apos;t start this ,
but i &apos;m gonna finish it .
and when you said i only ever looked at you as competition ,
you were wrong .
i never looked at you as anything at all .
are you all right ?
no .
is it true what you just said about his clients ?
no , which is why i need you
to do anything you have to do
to convince him this is happening .
i &apos;ll get it done .
what are you doing here ?
this is my home .
it &apos;s also your office .
and that entrance is right around there .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m in the middle of my dinner .
i called to set an appointment . you didn &apos;t call back .
because i had patients .
and what the hell am i ?
you &apos;re an ex @-@ patient i haven &apos;t seen in weeks ,
who ignored me when i said that your panic attacks
wouldn &apos;t stop until you accepted the fact
that your secretary wasn &apos;t coming back .
i did accept it , and i had another one anyway .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you mean you &apos;re here to get more pills .
yes , i am .
and what happened to the ones i gave you ?
i threw them out .
bullshit , you didn &apos;t throw them out .
you ran out .
no , i didn &apos;t run out . i &apos;m telling you the truth .
okay , well , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because i &apos;m a psychiatrist , not a pharmacy ,
and if you want my help , you do it my way .
you make regular appointments ,
and you commit to doing the work .
and you show up at my house unannounced again ,
i &apos;m calling the police .
do you have any time available ten minutes from now ?
i want to give you time to finish your dinner .
is the car ready ?
it &apos;s downstairs warming up , like you .
what do you mean ?
well , i received the invitation
and couldn &apos;t help but notice
that dr. barnes is in the program ,
and you &apos;re in the program too .
look at that , i am .
why didn &apos;t you tell me it was your speech ?
i wanted your honest opinion .
but you didn &apos;t ask for my opinion .
you asked me to check it for exposure .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve noticed about you ,
it &apos;s that you give your opinion
whether it &apos;s asked for or not .
and why does my opinion matter to you so much
that you would go through all this ?
your opinion doesn &apos;t matter to me .
your development does .
what are you saying ?
oh , you &apos;re gonna make me say it out loud ?
you remind me of me .
and what do i have to do to get to be like you ?
well , you should know .
you read my damn speech .
you mean i rewrote your damn speech .
oh , shit , i said it .
i &apos;m going to show you mercy ,
considering your dress choice .
what &apos;s wrong with my dress ?
oh , you don &apos;t know .
come on , this is really special .
you wanna know the truth ?
i think you bottled up your anger at donna ,
let it out at louis ,
and then when it came back at you ,
you pushed it down again .
that &apos;s bullshit .
the clinical term is displacement ,
and the cure for it is letting your anger at donna out .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that ,
because even if i would , donna &apos;s not here .
no , i didn &apos;t say you had to let it out at donna .
you can let it out at me .
that &apos;s stupid .
no , it isn &apos;t .
if she were here right now ,
what &apos;s the first thing that comes to your mind ?
hey , donna , what are you doing here ?
what if i said , &quot; i &apos;m here for you &quot; ?
i &apos;d say , &quot; shouldn &apos;t you be at louis &apos;s desk ? &quot;
and what if i were ? how would that make you feel ?
it would make me feel like role play is stupid ,
because you &apos;re not donna ,
and i don &apos;t give a shit what your degree says .
i &apos;m not gonna go through this again
just to get more pills .
well , i may not be donna ,
but i &apos;m beginning to see what it &apos;s like to be her .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about i &apos;m a woman
who you &apos;ve been bullying to get what you want .
bullying ? i &apos;m paying you .
and that doesn &apos;t mean that i exist to serve your needs .
well , it goddamn should .
if you spoke to donna that way ,
no wonder she left you .
because you don &apos;t just pay people to be loyal .
how dare you ?
i don &apos;t give a shit about the money , and i never did .
no , you didn &apos;t .
it was just a way to get me to do what you wanted .
so when your life was on the line
and i was there for you every step of the way ,
it meant nothing ?
it wasn &apos;t every step of the way .
you bailed out the second i wanted more .
that &apos;s when you decided to betray me .
how the hell is moving on and putting myself first
betraying you ?
because you went to louis to do it ,
and that &apos;s not moving on .
that &apos;s sticking a knife in my gut and twisting it .
yeah , harvey , it is .
how does it feel to be on the receiving end for once ?
harvey , did you hear me ?
i said , how does it feel to know that
you &apos;ve taken the first step towards regaining control ?
when someone twists a knife in your gut ,
i feel like i want to twist one right back .
mr. zane , you scheduled this hearing .
we &apos;ve been waiting ten minutes .
i &apos;m not waiting any longer .
uh , you don &apos;t have to , your honor .
my motion is here .
it better get up here fast .
where the hell were you ?
i &apos;m standing up here with my dick in my hand ,
and you &apos;re out having a soda .
i had something to do .
yeah , well , whatever it was ,
i hope it was worth almost losing this case over .
motion to expedite trial .
i thought this was a hearing on their motion to dismiss .
well , if you expedite our trial ,
that takes care of their motion to dismiss .
your honor , they just got this case two days ago .
they &apos;re using the timing of our client &apos;s contract expiration
to try to shake us down .
i have to say , mr. zane , i find it hard to believe
that in two days you &apos;ve found out enough
to know you need an expedited trial ,
let alone care about these people at all .
your honor , four years ago ,
a mail carrier named stanley powell
felt tightness in his chest .
he thought it was nothing ,
but his wife insisted he go to the hospital .
when he got there ,
doctors couldn &apos;t find anything wrong ,
but they wanted to keep him for one extra day .
now unfortunately ,
kelton insurance refused to pay .
so mr. powell went home , crawled into bed ,
and one day later , he was dead .
in front of you , you have a complaint
that &apos;s over 5,000 pages long ,
which tells the stories of another 189 victims .
pick a page at random , tell me the number ,
and i will tell you exactly what their client did to them .
your honor , are you actually buying that ?
page 627 , mr.--
lawrence green .
63 @-@ year @-@ old grandfather ,
admitted to st. vincent with complaints of lower back pain
and excessive weight loss .
he thought it was stress . turns out it was lymphoma .
only they didn &apos;t find out until it was too late
because their client refused to pay for the mri .
so please , rule against us if you have to ,
but don &apos;t tell me we don &apos;t care .
motion for expedited trial granted .
jury selection starts monday .
for your information , that &apos;s what i was doing .
and it only took as long as it did
because i was also doing something for the one person
who has the right to treat me like his associate
but treats me like his partner anyway .
well , if you can forgive me ,
what do you say i take my partner out to lunch ?
mr. specter--
gretchen , whatever it is , it can wait till tomorrow .
i &apos;m afraid this can &apos;t wait .
this is your resume .
i wanted to explain the two @-@ year gap
in my employment history .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
my husband passed away .
my children were grown .
i had no purpose , i felt alone ,
and i started having panic attacks .
and why would i need to know that ?
because i don &apos;t have them anymore .
good night , gretchen .
what was that all about ?
getting to know my new secretary .
did you come by just to brag about helping me with jack ?
i take it that means he backed down .
like roberto duran against sugar ray .
no match .
seriously ...
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . thanks .
want to get a bite or something ?
sure .
i got to warn you , my stomach &apos;s still full
from my lunch with robert zane .
oh , we &apos;re lunching now , are we ?
why , you jealous ?
no , i just thought you guys were working a case ,
not picnicking in a park .
let me tell you , it was no picnic .
you ever try to go toe @-@ to @-@ toe with that guy
over all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat shrimp ?
no match .
hey , give me a few minutes .
i gotta take care of something .
you ever take sides with jack soloff against me again ,
i will bury you .
