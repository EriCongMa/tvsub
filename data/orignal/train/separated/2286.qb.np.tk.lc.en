第十集
it was excalibur . it was just a small cut .
a wound from it cannot be healed .
i can use the promethean flame
to release you from excalibur ,
and then i can tether hook &apos;s life to it instead .
i &apos;m not as strong as you are .
i &apos;ve succumbed to darkness .
but our future .
really ?
i found this outside .
i suppose it &apos;s not the dark one --
more like the dark ones .
are you ready to learn what else happened in camelot ?
aye .
but first we have to take care of her .
get on with it , captain .
that squid ink &apos;s going to wear off soon .
killian , please .
what are you doing ?
you took my memories , swan .
you tried to stop me from knowing the truth .
and now i &apos;m going to return the favor .
by the look on your face ,
it would appear someone needs restraining .
there .
no more magic for you .
now , i assume , given my helpfulness ,
you &apos;ll allow me to go about my business undeterred .
as long as you don &apos;t get in my way ,
i won &apos;t get in yours .
i like this new you .
tell me , how does it feel to be a dark one ?
it feels like i &apos;ve been reborn .
milah !
you &apos;re no less a coward .
i want you to suffer .
just do it .
i promised you we &apos;d have some fun first .
emma , please !
bloody crocodile .
not exactly , but i understand the confusion .
that &apos;s not gonna work .
i &apos;m not out here . i &apos;m in there .
i am your guide ... the voice in your head .
save your speech . i know who you are .
all the dark ones in my head .
but it doesn &apos;t matter ... i won &apos;t listen to you .
what if i told you that together ,
i could get you the one thing
you &apos;ve wanted for hundreds of years ?
your revenge .
that &apos;s right .
i saw what you saw , dearie . i saw your pain .
and i can ease it .
stick with me and you will finally do
what you never could before .
and what &apos;s that ?
why , kill me , of course .
emma !
i &apos;ll check the basement .
i &apos;ll get the upstairs .
emma ! emma !
emma .
what happened ?
you turned hook into a dark one ?
it was the only way to save him .
and you didn &apos;t think of the consequences to everyone else ?
i couldn &apos;t just let him die .
you can understand that .
well , yes , but ...
now we have a bigger problem .
i know .
i didn &apos;t think any of this would happen .
i was trying to get rid of the darkness for good .
you can &apos;t tell me , after all zelena &apos;s done to you ,
your life wouldn &apos;t be easier if she were gone .
i was doing you a favor .
come on .
this is premeditated murder , emma .
there had to be another way . you should have come to us .
and risk losing someone else ?
i thought the best way to control the darkness
was to isolate myself .
but when i did that , there was no one around
to give me hope or tell me when i was being stupid !
fine . you &apos;re being stupid . so stop it .
right now , we have to clean up this mess .
no . we don &apos;t .
give us back our memories .
your dreamcatchers ...
regina can access them , can &apos;t she ?
we can piece together hook &apos;s plan and stop him .
i &apos;m afraid not .
dreamcatchers you said were in the shed ...
they &apos;re gone .
what the hell is captain dark one up to ?
emma turned you into a dark one ?
and now you &apos;ve come for your revenge .
the thought had crossed my mind .
for this lovely piece of hardware ,
i think i &apos;ll take your hand .
for milah , your heart .
for filling emma with the darkness ...
i think your head will do quite nicely .
so what are you waiting for ? get on with it .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . no .
i &apos;ve been waiting centuries for this moment .
and i really want to ...
... savor it .
get your affairs in order , dearie ,
for we duel at noon on my ship .
where it all began .
how poetic .
but we both know this weapon cannot kill you .
ah , true . that sword can &apos;t kill me .
but this one ... can .
excalibur .
you have it .
aye .
well , now that it &apos;s whole , it can no longer control me .
but it can ... oh , oh , oh ! ... kill me .
all you have to do is take it from me .
so , what say you , crocodile ?
shall we finish what we started ?
indeed .
once a pirate , always a pirate .
as a man , hook spent centuries trying to kill me .
it makes sense that revenge would be on his mind .
why wipe my memory
if he was going to announce his plan anyway ?
there must be more to it .
yeah , well , even if there is ,
we only have until noon to stop him .
and to save you .
what about merlin &apos;s message ?
he said this &quot; nimue &quot; is the key to stopping the dark one .
nimue was merlin &apos;s true love .
and she was also the first dark one .
i know .
how do we find out more about her ?
start your search with the dark one chronicles .
there are many texts that can help us .
as much as i appreciate devotion to scholarship ,
there is an easier way .
i am still a dark one .
i can protect you , gold .
you just have to take off the cuff .
you don &apos;t trust me .
well , if the situations were reversed , would you trust me ?
so it &apos;s true .
you &apos;re here .
henry .
i need you to tell them it &apos;s okay to take off this cuff .
it &apos;s the only way to figure it all out .
no .
what ?
you lied to us ... about hook , about everything .
why should we trust you now ?
henry , i &apos;m your mother .
are you ?
because the mom i knew wouldn &apos;t keep things from me .
i thought you were the one person who would understand .
i thought you were the one person i could trust .
so you can forgive regina and gold
for everything they &apos;ve done , but not me ?
they &apos;ve changed .
they showed me they changed .
so did i.
when we first met , yeah .
but the minute things got tough , you didn &apos;t come to anybody .
you decided that you would figure it out on your own .
we were a team .
operation cobra . i remember .
but now you just want your dark magic back
so you can do it alone .
and i &apos;ve seen what you do with dark magic .
he needs time , emma .
we should really get to the library .
we &apos;ve got a lot to do .
i have a stop to make first .
i &apos;ll meet you there .
let me guess ... i &apos;m not invited .
emma .
we love you .
you don &apos;t trust me .
we don &apos;t trust the darkness .
stay here and let us save you .
it &apos;s for the best .
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
it &apos;s too late .
the vault has already forged hook as its new dark one .
he went this way .
this way !
and then the tracks disappear .
we should split up , search the woods .
he &apos;s a dark one . he can transport himself anywhere .
so can emma .
we &apos;ve got to start looking somewhere .
there &apos;s no time .
of all the paths i foresaw for your daughter ,
i &apos;m afraid that this was the darkest .
we should return to granny &apos;s .
even without my magic ,
i still have enough ingredients to make preparations .
i don &apos;t care how bad things got ...
emma wouldn &apos;t hurt us .
maybe .
but this new dark one ,
we need as many allies as we can get .
lancelot , your mother &apos;s the lady of the lake .
could she help us ?
perhaps .
perhaps ?
lancelot , you should go .
she does have great power .
the lake is but a two @-@ day journey from here .
it &apos;s worth a try .
and if i don &apos;t make it in time ?
well , then you get to spend your last moments with your mother .
we were so close , mary margaret .
emma was seconds away
from destroying the darkness and ending this .
and hook would have been dead .
she chose love , david .
and we would have done the same thing .
we &apos;d share one heart
because we took the same kind of risk that emma took .
we save each other . that is what our family does .
so have some faith in her .
i do .
i just hope her faith in hook is justified .
what the devil am i wearing ?
why must dark ones dress like monks ?
yes , much better . i went leather as well .
get out of here .
try to ignore me . bet you can &apos;t .
talk all you want , spirit . i know you &apos;re lying .
there &apos;s no way that i can get my revenge
when gold &apos;s in storybrooke and i &apos;m trapped here in camelot .
well , that &apos;s where we come in , dearie .
might i suggest a dark curse ?
and crush the heart of the one i love most to enact it ?
no , no , no . i won &apos;t kill emma .
yeah , but there &apos;s always a loophole .
killian ! it worked !
you &apos;re alive !
aye . it did .
after spending centuries quelling my bloodlust ,
you threw me right back into that darkness !
job well @-@ done , emma !
binding you to excalibur was the only way to save you .
right , excalibur .
and where is my shiny new tether ?
i don &apos;t know . it disappeared right after you did .
isn &apos;t that convenient ?
how long has he been with you ?
you can still see him ?
sadly , yes . i mean , she &apos;s still a dark one .
no matter how ineffectual she may be .
don &apos;t listen to him .
he &apos;s not real . but i am .
i &apos;m right here . look at me .
that future you told me not to be afraid of ...
we can have it .
the house in storybrooke .
i &apos;m not afraid anymore .
i want it .
with you .
it &apos;s ours .
you just have to want it , too .
aye , love , i do .
more than anything .
killian ...
look .
the demon &apos;s gone .
we can do this .
we can get the darkness out of both of us for good .
how ?
by doing what i just did with you .
by going to those we love .
rumple ?
what &apos;s wrong ? aren &apos;t you coming ?
i &apos;m afraid my preparations for this battle
can &apos;t be found in a book .
well , but this was your idea .
for you and the others ,
there might be some way to protect yourself .
for me ...
i &apos;ve spent an entire life running away from battles .
time to stop .
you don &apos;t have anything to prove anymore .
you saved me from merida .
you &apos;re a hero now .
but that doesn &apos;t erase a lifetime of cowardice --
nothing can .
belle ...
i know that i &apos;ve hurt you in unforgivable ways .
but i also know that not wanting me to die
isn &apos;t the same as wanting to be with me .
so if i survive this , i want to do better by you .
i want to love you in a way i never could before .
with honesty and courage .
let me be the man you deserve .
the man i swore on my son &apos;s grave that i would be .
i ... i don &apos;t know what to say .
don &apos;t say anything .
if i win ...
if i win , i go to the well where we were married .
and if you meet me there , i &apos;ll know how you feel .
you .
the mayor told me explicitly not to let you through .
well , then , you &apos;re just doing your job .
poorly , but you &apos;re doing it .
kudos to you .
not so fast , sis .
sister , dear .
thank you so much for looking after my bundle of joy
while i was off being kidnapped .
but i &apos;ve come to take her back now .
bye .
good luck with that .
where &apos;s my daughter ? !
did you really think ,
after everything you &apos;ve done ,
we wouldn &apos;t protect that child from you ?
she is my child !
she &apos;s also robin &apos;s .
and you will never take her away from him .
you just can &apos;t stand ,
that after a lifetime of you getting everything ,
it &apos;s finally my turn !
the only reason you have that baby
is because you killed marian
and you deceived robin
in the most vile way imaginable .
is that a compliment ?
this insanity has to stop .
agreed .
but i don &apos;t think it can .
actually , i think maybe it can .
you know , when regina asked me to guard you ,
the last thing i wanted to do was be in the same room as you .
now that we &apos;re here , this isn &apos;t so bad .
put it down , merida .
we both know you &apos;re not going to shoot me .
oh , won &apos;t i ? after everything you &apos;ve done to me .
fine . i &apos;d say an arrow to the knee would do you right good .
maybe me too .
don &apos;t worry , love .
a broken knee is nothing on a broken heart .
isn &apos;t that right , swan ?
what is this ?
i expected to find you and the heroes
huddled over a mountain of books ,
trying to figure out my terrible plan .
that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re here because you still have feelings for me .
oh , swan .
of course i still have feelings for you --
anger .
hatred . disappointment .
you don &apos;t mean that .
when you tethered me to excalibur ,
you opened my eyes .
and i now see you for what you really are ...
an anchor .
and i see clearly now
that you were nothing more
than a pretty blonde distraction .
but guess what , swan ? i am a free man now .
and you will never hold me back
from getting what i want again .
hook ... killian ...
whatever deal you made to get your revenge on gold ,
it &apos;s not worth it .
the darkness is using you .
it doesn &apos;t care what you want .
it only cares what it wants .
well , you &apos;re only a pawn
if you don &apos;t know you &apos;re being used .
as long as i get what i want ,
i don &apos;t give a damn about the rest .
and you of all people should understand that .
everything i did , i did for you .
well , you see , that &apos;s your problem , swan .
you &apos;re so afraid of losing the people that you love
that you push them away .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;ll always be an orphan .
you don &apos;t need some villain swooping in
to destroy your happiness .
you do that quite well all on your own .
why are you doing this ?
because ...
i want to hurt you ...
like you hurt me .
all right , enough distractions .
i am going to go scout our path .
i &apos;ll go replenish our water supply .
oh , what the devil is that noise ?
that &apos;s the sound of the dagger singing to the sword .
and if you can hear it ,
that means excalibur is quite close .
no , it &apos;s impossible . emma said it disappeared .
wake up , dearie !
your lover &apos;s lying .
she has the sword .
why would she lie to me ?
so she can control you .
not that she needs excalibur .
she &apos;s quite good at doing that all on her own .
what the bloody hell is that supposed to mean ?
you ! get out of here !
oh , we were just talking about you .
why don &apos;t you ask her yourself ?
ask me what ?
hook , what the hell &apos;s going on ?
emma , do you know where excalibur is ?
killian ...
rumple is manipulating you . that &apos;s what he does .
are you lying to me ?
i can hear it calling to the dagger , emma .
do you have excalibur ?
yes .
did you use it on me ?
what ?
no , of course not . i was never --
then why not tell me the truth ?
are you afraid i was gonna ask you for it ?
you never planned on giving it to me , did you ?
i did it to protect you .
you told me yourself
you were not strong enough to resist the darkness .
which is why i begged you not to turn me
into the bloody dark one in the first place !
but you went and did it anyway .
you were dying .
you know the worst part , swan ?
when your own mother
wanted to use the dagger to stop you
from crushing merida &apos;s heart ,
i &apos;m the one that convinced her
that you needed to make that decision yourself .
there &apos;s never been a moment where i didn &apos;t believe in you ,
where i didn &apos;t trust you .
but you clearly don &apos;t believe in me anymore ,
so how am i supposed to fight this ?
killian ...
don &apos;t .
hello , dark one .
sorry the , uh , shop &apos;s in a bit of a mess
since you sent merida here to kill belle .
forgive me if i don &apos;t offer you tea .
what can i do for you today ?
because i assume this isn &apos;t just a social visit .
i need help .
to stop hook ,
i need to get everyone &apos;s memories back , including my own .
and how do you plan on doing that ?
zelena and hook used squid ink to immobilize me .
there &apos;s still some left .
and you want me to use this on him during our duel .
all i ask is that you last long enough
to occupy him while i steal back the dreamcatchers .
ah , yes .
but for that ...
i don &apos;t need this .
this ... is where that magic belongs .
what are you doing ? you can &apos;t beat hook without it .
well , my feud with the captain predates you by centuries .
and if i am gonna beat him , i &apos;m gonna do it with honor .
and i will .
you &apos;re on a suicide mission .
oh , we &apos;ll see .
but my stakes ... are me .
yours are far greater .
do you really think you can win on your own ?
i know i can .
here &apos;s the thing about confidence , miss swan --
it &apos;s great at starting a fight ,
not so great at finishing one .
good luck .
before we go in , let me remind you
that you may have your powers back ,
but i &apos;ve also got mine .
what are we doing here ?
because if it &apos;s more lectures
about hope , decency , and redemption ,
i can save you the trouble -- i &apos;ve heard it all .
zelena .
did you miss me ?
told you . once you go green , you &apos;ll never go queen .
regina ...
we talked about this .
oh , couples therapy ?
i should imagine you two need that now .
let me remind you of something .
as wicked as you may think you are ,
you &apos;re not even in my league .
i &apos;ve spent so many years doing terrible ...
terrible things beyond your imagination .
but you know how i turned it around ?
henry .
it took having a child -- that unconditional love --
it made me my best self .
and i &apos;m hoping that kind of love will do the same for you .
make no mistake , zelena ,
we are never gonna be a family , the three of us .
but regina and i have agreed
you are her mother .
so against our best instincts ,
we still have hope for you .
so ... you can visit with our child
as long as one of us are present .
there , there , my little green bean .
there , there .
i &apos;m your mommy .
henry !
mom . you escaped ?
and for good reason .
i know how to figure this all out .
i need your help . i need you to trust me .
i told you --
i know , i know , and i heard you .
i really heard you .
i am not asking you to remove my cuff .
then how are you gonna do it without magic ?
i &apos;m gonna do it with help . with you .
hook stole the dreamcatchers .
he took my memories , too ,
which means i must know something .
if we can get it back , i can help everyone .
and , kid ...
no one was ever better at figuring out
how to break a spell than you .
operation cobra , remember ?
a locator spell .
there &apos;s one at grandpa &apos;s shop .
all i need is the stuff you used to make the dreamcatchers .
it will take us to the others .
so you will help me ?
i just need one more thing .
what &apos;s that ?
a name .
operation cobra , part ii ?
that &apos;ll do .
killian ?
killian ?
dark one , i summon thee .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know how else to get you here .
you could have given me a choice .
we need to talk about this .
do you have any idea how it feels
to not be in control of yourself ?
the last time a dark one controlled me ,
i had to watch as rumplestiltskin almost killed you .
i had to kneel , powerless ,
while he almost crushed my heart !
i know exactly how it feels !
all my life , everyone i loved abandoned me !
i didn &apos;t abandon you .
i know .
but i was about to lose you to the darkness .
when i &apos;m scared , that &apos;s when my walls go up .
that &apos;s when i stop trusting the people around me .
you know this .
it doesn &apos;t make it fair , swan .
killian , wait !
i didn &apos;t mean to do that .
aye , but you did -- and that &apos;s my point !
that &apos;s not why i called you here !
i called you here because i do believe in you !
i do trust you to control your own fate !
it &apos;s yours if you want it .
we are going to get the darkness out of both of us .
we are going to do it together .
i promise you ,
i will never try to control you again .
i love you .
what ?
it &apos;s just i &apos;m usually the one that has to say that first .
yeah , well ...
i love you , too .
i wasn &apos;t sure you &apos;d show .
and miss my chance to take your other hand ?
no , this won &apos;t do .
this has to be a fair fight .
i can &apos;t have your surviving family members
blame this loss on your limp .
it &apos;s been centuries ? since i stood here a mortal .
oh , you mean when i took milah ?
i remember thinking that day ,
what type of sad little man
is too afraid to fight for his own wife ?
yeah , well , i &apos;m not afraid anymore .
i know i have to fight for the people i love .
don &apos;t you mean die for the people you love ?
we shall see .
there you are !
we &apos;ve looked everywhere for you .
emma . what happened to you ?
are you okay ?
for now .
it looks worse than it is .
are you sure ?
aye .
we &apos;re ready to get the sickness out of us . where &apos;s merlin ?
he &apos;s inside .
well , let &apos;s get on with it , then .
i &apos;ll go get him . wait here .
if you &apos;re receiving this message ,
then things are worse than i feared .
there is only one person
who can help you defeat the dark one now .
her name is nimue .
if you want to destroy the darkness , then you must ...
the dark one &apos;s found me already .
heard you preparing for the worst @-@ case scenario .
i &apos;m sorry , mate . it &apos;s already here .
careful , dearie .
that &apos;s the oldest heart in all the realms .
let &apos;s cut it open and count the rings .
you &apos;re too late .
i &apos;ve already left a message for the others .
well , they can &apos;t do anything to stop me .
not while i have this .
excalibur .
what do you want ?
my revenge . and for that ,
i need to get back to storybrooke .
do you want to cast a curse ?
it &apos;s not possible .
not without crushing the heart of the thing you love most .
which is why i am not going to crush it .
but someone else will --
someone who might actually have feelings for you , dearie .
and that &apos;s not me .
but it is me .
nimue .
remember ?
i am all dark ones .
it &apos;s romantic , isn &apos;t it ?
after all that &apos;s happened between us ,
you &apos;re still the thing i love most .
and i do love you .
i always have .
but you &apos;re not really here .
aye , mate .
but she is .
she lives in all dark ones .
so when i crush your heart , so will she .
we can do this all day .
but until you have excalibur ,
it won &apos;t make a lick of difference .
they say the first cut is the deepest .
well , they lied .
this is it . you put them here .
makes no sense .
why would hook keep the dreamcatchers
where we could so easily get to them ?
because we can &apos;t get to them .
he knew i wouldn &apos;t have magic .
he &apos;s toying with me , tormenting me .
good thing the locator spell
wasn &apos;t the only thing i took from gold &apos;s shop .
call me an optimist ,
but i was hoping i &apos;d have to use it .
henry , are you sure ?
you didn &apos;t have to include me in this operation ,
but you did .
you didn &apos;t try and do it alone .
if you &apos;re willing to take that first step back , so am i.
i will make it up to you .
you want to start by saving the day ?
you were playing me the whole time .
once you lied about excalibur , all bets were off .
i knew it was just a matter of time
before you tried controlling me .
and now no one will ever control me again .
go back from whence you came .
back to stone .
i don &apos;t understand .
why are you helping him get his revenge ?
don &apos;t be naive , emma .
dark ones never do anything
without getting something in return .
what do you want ?
you &apos;re a dark one .
you know what we want . you want it too .
no .
you can &apos;t .
yes , we can .
and we will .
killian ...
your revenge is not your happy ending .
i am .
you told me that .
if you destroy this heart ,
you will destroy your happy ending along with it .
no , killian jones told you that .
your lovesick puppy dog .
but that man died
the moment you turned him into a dark one .
well , i have to hand it to you , crocodile .
you lasted a lot longer than i expected .
if you &apos;d fought me with such vigor back in the day ,
i might have given you your wife back .
soiled , but returned .
what are you waiting for , pirate ? finish him .
well , get on with it , crocodile .
there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d like better than to run you through .
but i think -- i think i &apos;d rather let you live ,
knowing for the rest of your life that i bested you .
today .
you ... you did it !
you won .
and you came .
oh , belle , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m ready to do this right , put the past behind us .
rumple ...
this isn &apos;t easy for me .
i love you .
and some part of me will always love you .
but you &apos;ve broken my heart too many times .
there &apos;s just too much broken trust .
but i &apos;ve changed .
my heart is pure now .
yeah , you -- you have , and it is .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re the man
that i always hoped you would be .
then why are you doing this now ?
now we have a chance to make this work .
i don &apos;t know that i want to make it work .
but i do know that if i &apos;m gonna try and figure that out ,
i need to do that on my own .
i can &apos;t ...
i have spent too many years trying to mend your heart .
now i @-@ i need to protect mine .
belle , please .
oh , don &apos;t take it too bad .
i mean , he died for a good cause .
i &apos;m sorry .
rest in peace .
it &apos;s over , emma .
i told you i would never abandon you .
i &apos;m not going to start now .
i &apos;m sorry , love .
once a curse has been enacted , you can &apos;t stop it .
yes . i might not be able to stop it ...
but i can make you forget why you cast it .
and that you were ever the dark one in the first place .
clever , dearie .
when you wake up , you &apos;ll be the man you were .
the man i love .
the man who loves me .
ah , you &apos;ll have to do more than that
if you want him to forget he was ever a dark one .
i know .
i need to erase the memories of everyone who knew ...
that i turned hook ... into a dark one .
right .
because no one could possibly understand .
why trust your family to help
when you can do it all yourself ?
this was my fault .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to fix this .
by using dark magic to add a memory wipe to the curse .
but you won &apos;t like where it leads .
or worse ...
you will .
how did this get back here ?
arthur .
what is that ?
dark magic .
extremely dark magic .
and we &apos;re meant to believe
you &apos;re gonna give back our memories , just like that ?
we can trust her .
can we ?
yes .
okay .
emma , what &apos;s wrong ?
i remember .
i know what he &apos;s doing . i know what they are doing .
congratulations . you didn &apos;t completely fail .
you returned from your duel
with exactly the right ingredients for our plan .
the blood of a man who &apos;d been to hell and back .
rumplestiltskin has done what few can claim .
he died , and then he returned .
this pond holds a portal to the underworld itself .
this is where the fury tried to drag robin hood to hell .
i thought the portal only appeared
when the moon reaches its zenith .
yes , for a fury .
but it &apos;s always existed , dearie .
you just have to know how to open it .
bloody hell .
that &apos;s exactly where that came from .
nimue .
we &apos;re here .
all of us , as promised , in the flesh .
and now it &apos;s time to get to work ,
to do what dark ones do best --
snuff out the light .
welcome to storybrooke , love .
