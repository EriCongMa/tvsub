amelia porter
you need to get up .
what happened ?
where &apos;s andy ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
i remember an accident ?
andy didn &apos;t make it .
come on .
i don &apos;t get it .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
it didn &apos;t come up .
hello . we &apos;re not talking about switching to decaf .
you and beth broke up .
dave--
i have a 20 @-@ year @-@ old bottle of scotch
we could have drowned your sorrows in .
it wasn &apos;t like that . she got an offer
to run a major gallery in hong kong ,
she asked my advice , i told her she should accept .
so you encouraged her to spread her wings and fly .
my exact words were i didn &apos;t want her to have any regrets .
there was that time you took jack
on that impromptu weekend to orlando .
was that to tell him about beth ?
it was an effort to distract him , yeah .
you &apos;re an excellent dad , aaron .
don &apos;t you ever doubt that for a second .
so what &apos;s your social life been like in the meantime ?
no , i don &apos;t really have time to meet anyone .
we &apos;re kind of busy here .
well , what about online dating ?
really ?
bad idea .
look , there &apos;s , um ,
this little jazz club in dupont circle
i planned on going to saturday night .
you &apos;re coming with me .
no , no , no .
this isn &apos;t just about you , aaron .
i &apos;m , shall we say , intrigued by the in @-@ house jazz singer there ,
and you will be my wingman .
can &apos;t wait .
ok , crime fighters , we have a triple homicide
in salt lake city , utah . a couple ,
ron and karen myerson were found shot to death
in their home 4 hours ago .
several hours before that , a security guard
was found stabbed to death at a small office building .
and let me guess-- the gun used to shoot the couple
belonged to the security guard .
get your mug out &apos; cause coffee is for closers .
no sign of a break @-@ in or forced entry .
maybe the couple knew the unsub .
this could be personal .
that could mean that the couple were his intended targets .
but it wouldn &apos;t have taken him hours to get to their house .
what was he doing in the meantime ?
watching the couple , conducting surveillance ,
or he encountered them earlier and was torturing them .
but the m.e. and the police both say there was no evidence
they were held for any length of time .
one thing is clear . both crime scenes look chaotic .
this unsub is disorganized .
the chaos could mean that this unsub is either psychotic
or under some time pressure . and improvising .
and if he can &apos;t decompress ,
he may feel killing &apos;s his only option .
we may be looking at a spree .
wheels up in 30 .
hey , hurry up !
you can put that away .
i told you i &apos;d help you .
come on , let &apos;s go .
listen .
you need to calm down .
you did not have to kill that couple or that security guard .
you were leaving a trail of bodies
because you can &apos;t keep it together .
shut up .
get in .
look , you might as well just draw a road map for the cops .
have you ever looked death in the eye ?
&apos;cause i have .
and i &apos;ve seen the grim reaper
staring right back at me .
we should wait till it &apos;s dark before we leave .
and if you don &apos;t want another body ,
we need food and water for rebecca .
&quot; remove my sin and i will be clean .
wash me and i will be whiter than snow . &quot;
psalm 51 .
assuming the kills are personal ,
what do we know about ron and karen myerson .
both in their 40s . ron was the manager of a sports bar ,
karen a dental assistant .
they had some financial problems . maxed out 4 credit cards .
ron took out a payday loan last week .
they were living on the brink .
ron &apos;s been to reno 4 times in the last few months .
he may have a gambling problem ,
but if he owes someone money , does that make this a hit ?
but would a professional killer
murder a security guard for a weapon ?
well , based on the disorganization of the kills ,
i for one would not be surprised if this was a crime of passion .
agent hotchner ?
yes , sir .
thanks for coming out .
this is agent jareau .
hi , how are you ?
we &apos;ve increased patrols on the south side of the city
since you said a spree killer may be at work .
any activity since the killings ?
no , but we just spoke to a friend of the couple
who was at a marriage counseling retreat with them .
the wife wasn &apos;t feeling well ,
so they went home a day early .
maybe they surprised the unsub . who reported the crime ?
the neighbor from across the street .
did he hear anything last night ?
only the sound of a car backfiring around 2 a.m.
it could have been gunshots .
all right , i &apos;ll let the others know .
good .
this neighborhood &apos;s not exactly a high traffic area .
there &apos;s no surveillance cameras .
but they have an armed guard .
what kind of place needs privacy and security ?
well , it &apos;s mainly attorneys , accountants , psychologists .
maybe they were worried about unstable patients and clients .
rossi , look at this .
those have to be the unsub &apos;s bloody shoe prints .
yeah , but there &apos;s two sets .
well , the guard didn &apos;t make it far from his desk .
those can &apos;t be his .
it looks like that second set of prints
stayed out there by the edge .
maybe he was just a witness .
the unsub could have been surprised by someone else in the lobby .
maybe he kidnapped the witness .
but a possibility is it was a partner .
it would make it a hell of a lot easier
to overtake an armed guard .
even without gambling problems ,
i can see how they maxed out 4 credit cards .
this couple likes nice things .
something valuable could have been stolen
and the police wouldn &apos;t necessarily know .
state of the art . we should check their insurance list .
the couple was found over here .
they were both shot in the chest .
which means the unsub was standing right about here .
he came in from the backyard .
well , talk about a bad gopher problem .
these holes were dug recently . look at the dirt .
what were they digging for , buried treasure ?
why would the myersons bury anything in their yard ,
judging by the safe in their house ?
so it had to be the unsub .
came looking for something ,
got surprised when they came home early .
killed them , and then based on what jj said ,
spent another hour trying to find what he was looking for .
how did he know there was something buried back here ?
we &apos;ve been saying this crime felt personal .
what if the unsub used to live here ?
we should have garcia pull a list of prior residents .
the unsub either has a partner or a hostage with him ,
most likely male based on the prints .
go ahead , garcia .
i did a search of previous owners of 23 cherry lane ,
aka , the myerson home , and before they lived there ,
it was owned by professor harold mason .
he was there for 7 years , bought it from the bank
who repossessed it from amelia porter ,
a notorious killer in the state .
i remember that name .
she was a 30 @-@ year @-@ old woman .
she and her much younger lover got high on drugs
and raped and murdered his sister .
i think her name was miriam .
the younger lover was benton farland ,
17 at the time , convicted of murder for the crime ,
but amelia fled the scene . she wasn &apos;t found .
where &apos;s farland now ?
uh , he served 12 years at utah state prison .
and he was released two days ago .
he &apos;s gotta be our unsub .
thanks , garcia .
here .
you did the right thing .
i don &apos;t think she would have lasted much longer .
what ?
i just can &apos;t believe how much she looks like miriam .
my mom .
i didn &apos;t kill her , you know .
i mean , i was there .
i should have stopped amelia , but i didn &apos;t kill her .
you &apos;re a liar !
becca .
i got blamed &apos; cause amelia ran away .
but i didn &apos;t do it .
i loved miriam .
she was everything to me .
we don &apos;t remember her that much .
we were both pretty young .
well , i &apos;m sorry about that .
i &apos;m sorry that you don &apos;t even have memories .
so where are we gonna hide ?
come on , think about it .
you need a place where you &apos;re safe
and you can come up with a plan .
i don &apos;t know .
ok . look , i have a buddy
who has a cabin in the mountains not far from park city .
your buddy has a cabin ?
his parents do . it &apos;s like a vacation house .
they only use it a few times out of the year .
the rest of the time it &apos;s empty .
we &apos;ll go there tonight .
all right , copy that , rossi .
we &apos;ll go talk to benton &apos;s father .
this is awful . miriam , the sister ,
was a 29 @-@ year @-@ old single mom
of two young kids when she was killed .
how did benton only serve 12 years for such a heinous crime ?
well , it was a combination of his age
and willingness to testify against amelia porter .
ultimately the jury felt he was a sensitive boy
who was unduly influenced by an older dominant woman .
how did amelia manage to escape ?
she fled into the wilderness .
her father was a survivalist ,
so she learned outdoor skills from him .
has anyone seen her since then ?
that &apos;s a good question .
garcia &apos;s the name , 411 &apos;s the game .
hey , mama , any confirmed sightings of amelia porter
in the last 12 years ?
yeah . one 10 years ago .
oh . and one 5 years ago .
both in canada . one in vancouver ,
the latest one in the northern territories .
but when authorities got there , she was nowhere to be found .
the northwest territories are hard to get to
and therefore an easy place to hide .
assuming benton has a male partner with him ,
does he have any old friends here
he could have reconnected with ?
uh @-@ uh . when he was a teen , he was a total loner .
that &apos;s probably the reason why amelia porter
was able to get him under her thumb so good .
all right , we need to look for connections
he may have had in jail .
heads up , guys , i got a real bad feeling about this .
clear !
clear .
guys , over here .
the victim is benton &apos;s father , oren farland .
you know , this could have been the first kill ,
the one that triggered the others .
oren lived here with his grandchildren , andy and rebecca .
the grandchildren are missing .
are these the kids of the sister who got murdered ?
yeah .
so what was he after coming out here ?
think about it . benton was 17 when he went to prison .
imagine you &apos;re incarcerated
for 12 years and have just been released .
where do you go ?
home .
you have $ 40 left after buying a bus ticket
with your prison release money .
you have no skills to help you survive in the real world ,
no friends , nowhere to turn but family .
who knows how they &apos;ll feel about seeing you again ,
but , really , what choice do you have ?
looks like someone was entertaining .
i think it was the kids .
thanks for the lemonade .
yeah , sure .
grandpa &apos;s just out buying some groceries . so ...
yeah , you said .
so , is old mr. litvak still teaching english lit ?
yeah . mm @-@ hmm .
man , that guy was a ball @-@ buster .
but i practically memorized &quot; macbeth &quot; because of him .
&quot; will all great neptune &apos;s ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand ? &quot;
where are you guys ?
i could use a little help unloading the groceries .
hi , dad .
the kids sat here .
oren sat at the head of the table ,
which means benton sat right there .
benton wasn &apos;t sitting very close to oren ,
which means he wasn &apos;t exactly welcome .
then why invite him to stay ?
probably to appease him , so he &apos;d go away peacefully
and leave them alone .
that obviously didn &apos;t happen .
so what went wrong ?
i just want to say thank you
for letting me stay for dinner .
eat up .
then go .
dad , if you &apos;d just give me a second--
i don &apos;t have any children left .
if you &apos;d just let me explain something .
i &apos;m not interested .
dr. pelman said that if we don &apos;t forgive ,
we &apos;ll never heal and move on .
is that the b.s. i pay that quack therapist to tell you ?
&quot; then you will remember your evil ways
&quot; and your deeds that were not good .
&quot; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight
for your iniquities and your abominations . &quot;
you show up like a bad penny to quote scripture to me ?
i have repented .
and i would kill myself right now
if it would bring miriam back .
maybe it will .
you should give it a try .
i know you &apos;ll never forgive me .
but i &apos;m your own flesh and blood .
don &apos;t you have any feelings for me at all ?
the feeling i have for you for you is ...
i &apos;d like to gut you
for being the vile bastard that you are !
grandpa ! stop !
oren couldn &apos;t contain is anger .
he stood up , threatened benton ,
who then stabbed him with the steak knife .
i think i know what happened to the kids .
no ! no !
no , no , no ! no , let her go !
you saw what he was gonna do .
he was trying to kill me . i had no choice !
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna tell the cops .
no , no cops ! they will never believe it .
i just got out of prison .
they &apos;ll throw me back in there for life !
ok . look , we won &apos;t call them .
i got a better idea . you &apos;re both coming with me .
benton probably took the kids as an insurance policy .
after he murdered his father ,
he knew the police wouldn &apos;t believe him ,
so he had to go on the run .
hey , what you got , baby girl ?
i &apos;ve confirmed it wasn &apos;t a random thing
that benton farland showed up at that office
where the security guard was killed ,
because andy farland has a therapist
named dr. pelman who works there .
how long was andy in therapy ?
uh , 3 years . he was having trouble in school .
that &apos;s not a surprise given his mother was murdered by his uncle .
garcia , did andy have any contact with benton
when he was in prison ?
uh @-@ huh . unfortunately , yes .
all of it the last two years .
he visited him twice , wrote him 3 letters .
contact with benton may have humanized him .
instead of fearing him , andy might actually have empathy for him .
if you behave ...
i promise i won &apos;t hurt you .
do you believe me ?
do you believe me ?
you know , when i was little ,
a teacher told me that i was snake @-@ bitten .
you know what that means ?
i attract bad luck .
everything i touch turns to garbage .
but it &apos;s not my fault .
i &apos;m jinxed .
nothing ever goes my way .
you found the money , though , right ?
in the backyard ?
yeah .
i found the money .
crap . what do i do ?
pull over .
license and registration .
yeah . is there a problem , officer ?
we have a 10 @-@ 57 with multiple injuries
on route 6 near hawthorne .
all units in the area please report .
copy that . victor 5 on the way .
10 @-@ 4 , victor 5 .
your tail light is out .
i &apos;m letting you off with a warning , but get it fixed .
sure thing .
maybe you kids are my lucky charm .
we know that after his prison release ,
benton farland went home
and murdered his father in an improvised way .
he then fled with his niece and nephew .
he needed a weapon , so he killed an armed security guard .
he then went over to the myerson house to dig up money
that was buried there .
he shot the couple when they surprised him .
he &apos;s in an extreme state of mind .
he believes that his only choices are fight or flight .
he &apos;s looking for any way he can to escape ,
which makes him highly unpredictable .
he &apos;s armed and dangerous
and he &apos;s already killed 4 victims .
benton is most likely traveling
in his father &apos;s automobile .
it &apos;s a 1993 gold volvo ,
license plate number 631 zfg .
we believe he &apos;s with his niece and nephew ,
andy and rebecca .
andy could be trying to help his uncle ,
but rebecca is most certainly a hostage .
or it could be that andy is
simply trying to protect his sister .
you need to increase patrols
on major roads leading out of the city .
we cannot emphasize enough how volatile this situation is .
one wrong move could result in more deaths .
whose is that ?
you said you wouldn &apos;t hurt me , so let me go .
there &apos;s hardly anyone around here .
i swear , i won &apos;t go to the cops.--
i can &apos;t do that .
but you said---
enough !
i &apos;m not going to leave a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl alone
on the side of the road .
that would be breaking my promise .
andy !
oh , my god .
are you ok ?
ok , i know amelia porter had survival skills ,
but she must be some sort of a criminal mastermind
to have just vanished without a trace for all these years .
maybe she has a new version of benton helping here .
he wasn &apos;t her first young stud .
according to her cousin &apos;s statement ,
she dated several younger men
before benton , all in their early 20s .
benton was the youngest of the bunch .
makes sense .
younger men were easier to seduce and control .
the farland car was just found .
it was involved in a crash .
it &apos;s amazing andy survived ,
considering how lethal benton has been .
he &apos;s either incredibly lucky or he was allowed to live .
hopefully we &apos;ll be able to get some answers from him soon .
no cell phone or i.d. in the woman &apos;s purse .
what do you think ? she another hostage ?
it &apos;s too many people for benton to control .
i think she was a good
samaritan that stopped to help with the crash ,
benton killed her and took her car .
we searched a 100 @-@ yard perimeter .
there &apos;s no sign of rebecca farland .
so there &apos;s a good chance
he has her and that she &apos;s still alive .
if that &apos;s the case , what &apos;s he holding her for ?
andy . agents callahan and morgan , fbi .
where &apos;s rebecca ?
we &apos;re looking for her .
can you tell us who shot you ?
benton farland .
my uncle .
he didn &apos;t have his seatbelt on ,
and i crashed the car on purpose .
he figured out i was trying to kill him .
were you helping him before that ?
no . no , i was just pretending , to protect my sister .
but you have to find her .
please , he &apos;s gonna kill her .
we &apos;re doing everything we can ,
but right now we need you to help us .
where would he take her ?
i told him about my friend &apos;s vacation cabin .
we were headed there before the crash .
what &apos;s the address ?
it &apos;s the yellow house at the end of canyon ridge lane .
please , you have to hurry .
she &apos;s gonna say something to set him off .
all right , thanks .
morgan and kate just left the cabin . no sign of anyone .
they should have been there by now .
if it was andy &apos;s suggestion to go there ,
benton probably changed his plan after andy betrayed him .
we just found a burned @-@ out car
about 50 miles away on route 190 .
her dmv photo matches the good samaritan .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
i &apos;m tired .
and cold .
where are we going , anyway ?
i just want to know when we can rest .
we &apos;ve been walking for hours ,
and my foot hurts .
when we get there , you &apos;ll know .
my mom used to say that .
well , she got it from our mom .
there &apos;s no way you could have remembered that .
you were too young .
but i do remember .
and i remember when i was little
and you used to put me on your shoulders
so that i could touch the star on our christmas tree .
yeah , i did do that .
how stupid do you think i am ?
what ? i--i don &apos;t--
this trying to bond with me and build rapport
isn &apos;t going to work .
it &apos;s the same crap your brother pulled .
you shot him , didn &apos;t you ?
you told me that andy died in the accident ,
but you shot him !
it &apos;s all coming back to me now .
he tried to kill me ...
and i had to pay him back .
it &apos;s only fair ...
don &apos;t you think ?
when someone betrays you .
we should check the ...
yes , sir .
the good new is , there don &apos;t seem
to be any human remains inside .
any idea why he stopped here ?
no , we &apos;re pretty far from anything .
any hiking trails nearby that you know of , detective ?
not any major ones .
hey , hotch , take a look at this .
these treads look remarkably like
those from benton &apos;s shoes .
what &apos;s off in that direction ?
the summit trail in about 10 miles .
that branches into other paths that lead down into a valley .
any residents in the valley ?
there &apos;s a smattering of small farms and houses .
benton came here on purpose .
he has a destination in mind .
if it &apos;s not a prison connection ,
it might be someplace he remembered from his childhood .
i &apos;ll follow up with garcia .
i haven &apos;t betrayed you .
i haven &apos;t done anything to hurt you .
look , i know it sounds like i &apos;m trying to play you
by saying that i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a bad guy ,
but i really believe it .
you have a heart . you &apos;re just snake @-@ bitten like you said .
that i am .
if you let me go , i swear ,
i won &apos;t tell anyone where you are .
here &apos;s what i think .
you haven &apos;t betrayed me yet , but the first chance you get ...
you will .
that &apos;s not true .
i think it is .
but just remember ,
i always get my payback .
mornin &apos; !
hey .
careful up ahead . it looks like part of the path
got washed out with the last storm .
ok , well , thanks for the warning .
honey , you look blue as a popsicle .
didn &apos;t you bring your jacket ?
you know , i told her to , but , teenagers , right ?
ain &apos;t that the truth .
have we met before ?
you look so familiar .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
well , you must remind me of one of
my daughter &apos;s classmates .
all right , thanks for the heads @-@ up .
yeah . have a good .
andy said his uncle never mentioned a jailhouse connection .
thank you so much .
i just spoke to the prison warden .
benton managed to stay a loner behind bars .
he never affiliated with any groups
or made friends with other prisoners .
that &apos;s not easy to do for 12 years .
most people have an instinct for a social connection .
maybe he had one .
i &apos;m not following .
well , he didn &apos;t need any social connections when he was in prison
because he already had one .
amelia porter .
except she &apos;s somewhere in canada
sleeping among the moose and bears .
people also have a natural instinct to return home .
yeah , and benton did .
yeah , maybe amelia came home .
i &apos;m going to have garcia look for women in their 40s
who appeared in the area in the last 5 years
with little or no history before that .
two hikers in the mountains may have spotted the suspect
and his niece about 30 minutes ago .
where are we ?
whose house is this ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
hi , amelia .
ok , i searched a 50 @-@ mile radius
of where the good samaritan &apos;s car was burned
and i found not one , but two women who match the criteria
we &apos;re looking for .
the first is jane appleby .
she &apos;s lived in the area for 5 years .
she &apos;s an organic farmer .
i got nothing on her prior to 2009 .
and the other ?
uh , that would be natasha banks .
she &apos;s from winnipeg , canada . she &apos;s lived there for 4 years .
but when i look her up past 2009,
i can &apos;t find anything .
all right , dave , you , kate ,
and reid go to jane appleby &apos;s house .
the rest of us will take natasha banks .
how did you find me ?
you were always prepared for a disaster .
i never forgot the old survival plan .
that was my plan . you were never a part of it .
then you shouldn &apos;t have gotten drunk and told me about it .
who &apos;s this ?
you don &apos;t recognize her ?
it &apos;s rebecca , miriam &apos;s daughter .
doesn &apos;t she look just like her mother ?
oh , my god .
you &apos;re sick .
did you kidnap her ?
did i kidnap you ?
no .
see ?
we like each other .
what do you want ?
can &apos;t you guess ?
you know , something &apos;s been bothering me .
if benton always intended to meet amelia after his release ,
why did he go home first ?
good question . it wasn &apos;t just to take revenge on dad .
it wasn &apos;t until after he was on the run
that he went to amelia porter &apos;s old house .
like he was improvising .
ok , here &apos;s a radical thought .
what if amelia wasn &apos;t the dominant one ?
what if it was really benton ?
the prosecutors called her a femme fatale ,
always dating younger men .
it could have been that she herself was immature .
her parents described her as shy and naive .
only benton called her manipulative .
she never killed anyone before or
after miriam as far as we know .
what &apos;s interesting is amelia was 30 back then ,
and his sister was almost the same age at 29 .
benton was always attracted to older women .
the fantasy of raping
and killing the sister could have been his .
when benton testified ,
he said that when his mother died when he was 9,
miriam became his entire world .
he could &apos;ve been obsessed with her .
but miriam was 21 with a life of her own .
if she was absent a lot ,
that would &apos;ve fueled both desire and rage in him .
12 years !
i spent 12 years in that hellhole
while you got off scot @-@ free .
stop it !
just stop it !
i think that &apos;s enough payback .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetheart .
but you deserved it .
it doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t love you .
the other reason i &apos;m here
and the reason why i brought rebecca ,
is so that we could relive
the most exciting moment in our lives .
doesn &apos;t that sound like fun ?
no ! no !
i admit , she &apos;s a little young for my taste ,
but she looks so much like miriam , doesn &apos;t she ?
go ahead .
do it . you know you want to .
you can &apos;t make me this time .
make you ?
oh , amelia , stop lying to yourself .
you loved it . it was glorious .
i was high . i was out of my mind seeing things .
you touched god in that moment .
we murdered your sister .
fbi !
drop the weapon !
you &apos;re not taking me with you .
he &apos;s crazy . he tried to force me to hurt her .
this coming from the woman who killed miriam ?
you are a madman .
and you &apos;re a fugitive from the law .
we &apos;ve been looking for you for 12 years , amelia .
it was him . it was always him .
why did you run ?
who would believe me ?
who would believe me over a 17 @-@ year @-@ old boy ?
put the gun down . amelia &apos;s the one we want .
she &apos;s the one we &apos;re after , and you led us to her .
your nephew andy explained
how everything happened , benton .
we know none of this was your fault .
he &apos;s alive ?
he &apos;s in the hospital .
thank god .
let her go , benton .
&quot; the soul that has conceived one wickedness
can nurse no good thereafter . &quot;
sophocles .
isn &apos;t she great ?
she &apos;s great . you could do worse .
so , when are you going to introduce yourself ?
ah , i don &apos;t know , aaron . i &apos;m not gonna plan ,
i &apos;m just gonna go with the flow
and see what opportunities arise .
and i suggest you do the same .
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
yes . that &apos;s a great start .
um , thanks for the bottle of champagne .
bartender told me you sent it .
