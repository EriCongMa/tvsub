the body has approximately 11 organ systems ,
all doing different things at the same time .
in order to keep us functioning , or , well , alive ,
they need one voice -- a leader , a master --
and in our brains , that job belongs to the pituitary gland .
it senses the body &apos;s needs before they even arise ,
working nonstop .
the pituitary gland communicates with all of the other glands ,
telling them when to produce
the vital hormones we need to function .
it keeps everything running smoothly , in perfect order .
you want a muffin ?
no , no .
you sure ?
go , go .
there &apos;s no denying it -- it has the toughest job in the place .
are you nervous ?
you &apos;re not nervous .
of course i &apos;m nervous .
been waiting for this day my entire career ,
and i promised them &quot; candy disco rainbows . &quot;
and now i have to deliver .
am i nervous ?
you will deliver .
i just need it to be perfect -- just today .
oh , no , no . go on .
uh , you can &apos;t be late for rounds .
people will think i &apos;m giving you special treatment .
go on .
okay .
no , special treatment !
okay .
i &apos;ll see you later ... chief .
thanks .
this can &apos;t be right . they live here ?
i mean , when you said carpool , i thought you meant just us .
where is alex ?
are owen and i going out and i didn &apos;t even realize it ?
does that happen ? do adults even do that ?
i don &apos;t know . stop asking .
carpooling is supposed to save time .
this guy with the beard --
i have seen him - perform a sex act to buy drugs ,
take the drugs , and fall asleep .
he &apos;s had a full day already .
and yet we &apos;re still here .
at least i think he &apos;s asleep .
adults go home together .
they don &apos;t go out . they don &apos;t go steady .
we &apos;re not 15 .
you made out with him on our front porch .
and i have no idea what that means .
uh , i @-@ i thought we were friends . what does it mean ?
you sound 15 .
alex !
i &apos;ve been sitting out here 20 minutes .
well , yell at jo
for not changing her oil in over a decade .
between you and this anatomy class , my morning is shot .
i need to stop teaching this anatomy class .
your neighbors seem nice .
yeah , the block &apos;s a pit , but it &apos;s cheap .
everybody buckled ?
webber needs one of us
to walk bailey into her surprise breakfast thing this morning .
no , thanks .
not i.
i hate all of you .
chief .
happy first day .
thank you .
i need to thank you for giving me this class to teach .
it was very generous . i love shaping young minds .
you &apos;re welcome .
i need to give it back .
not possible .
oh , i need you to handle miss o &apos;neil &apos;s
j @-@ tube replacement this morning .
thank you .
it &apos;s just a lot more work than i expected ,
and with three children and my patients ...
oh , and -- and , also , find someone
to cover the bariatric clinic this afternoon .
... and my surgeries , which actually makes
finding time to prep for the class impossible .
t-- look , i &apos;m asking you to do this stuff , so do it .
anything else to say ?
we &apos;re late - for the attendings &apos; meeting .
the ... attendings &apos; meeting ? did no one read my e @-@ mail ?
i mean , i just -- i just-- i @-@ i barely know this woman .
we had like two dates last week .
she asked to see me again tonight .
it &apos;s crazy .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about her .
you know when you meet someone
and you get that flutter that --
that rush and it feels like you know them
and they know you and you think to yourself ,
&quot; i could stare at this person &apos;s face forever &quot; ?
do you know what i mean ? or maybe not .
so , i looked it up , and bailey &apos;s the first .
first what ?
first female chief of surgery of this hospital .
before that , all men .
i say it &apos;s about time .
and all the department chiefs are women -- neuro , cardio ...
we got trauma .
... ortho ...
let it go .
... fetal ...
badass ! ladies .
this place is run by ladies .
it &apos;s ... &quot; ladyplace . &quot;
no . it is not ladyplace .
&quot; ladyplace &quot; is what my grandma calls her vagina .
to anyone who will listen , by the way -- she is not shy .
no , we can &apos;t call this place ladyplace .
i don &apos;t need to think of that sweet , sweet , raunchy ,
old lady &apos;s vag every time i walk through the doors .
me neither , but i will now .
she &apos;s coming , she &apos;s coming !
hurry , hurry , hurry !
well , i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re all here .
but if you had read your e @-@ mail ,
you would have known that one of the many things
that i will be implementing as chief
is no more weekly attendings &apos; meetings .
actually , this is a st--
see , - less talking about saving lives
and more saving of the lives .
thank you .
did i miss bailey &apos;s party ?
it wasn &apos;t a party .
i couldn &apos;t stop sleeping .
i think i &apos;m fighting off a cold
or it &apos;s jet lag or just sleeping in a bed .
down comforter works like morphine .
did you talk to jackson yet ?
he slept here last night .
god , so you actually are -- what the hell is that ? !
what ? what ? what ?
on your back !
what &apos;s on my back ? do i have a mole or something ?
what --
what ? !
arizona !
i have a rash .
it &apos;s a stupid rash .
you are completely overreacting .
i &apos;m sorry . i work with babies .
kepner , you &apos;ve got lesions , a cough , a fever .
you were in the middle east .
i was traveling .
i am run down .
you can be run down in the bubble ,
look , we don &apos;t know what you have .
we don &apos;t know how contagious you are .
this is my first day running this place .
there will be no epidemics today .
what did infectious disease say ?
as of now , her symptoms are nonspecific ,
but they want to rule out anthrax .
any concerns about mers ?
oh , god . you think ?
i &apos;m right here .
and you will stay right there until your tests come back .
this stops with patient zero .
i am not patient zero .
i &apos;m not a patient at all .
goodbye , kepner .
do not cross that line .
stay in the bubble .
i cannot --
in the bubble .
i will visit you , i promise .
may i see it -- the rash ?
it &apos;s nothing , right ?
i &apos;ll keep my eye out for your labs .
okay .
but , maybe we can talk if ...
look , i &apos;m saying we should page neuro .
why ?
her vitals her stable , her bloodwork &apos;s normal ,
we sewed up her head lac
she &apos;s obviously fine .
fine , you discharge her .
discharge who ?
hi , chief .
her .
... &quot; jade bell . &quot;
hello . i &apos;m dr. bailey .
oh , good . more doctors .
the patient complained of a headache and blurry vision
before she fainted and hit her head ,
so i did a complete syncope work @-@ up ,
which was negative .
so ... what ? that led you to ...
sew up her head lac .
what is her diagnosis ?
hypoglycemia ?
she probably just forgot to eat breakfast ?
wrong . you , what did this one miss ?
beta hcg -- could you be pregnant ?
not a chance .
look , i was in a meeting , i felt dizzy ,
and i woke up here , but i feel fine now .
can i go ?
no , you cannot .
what ... are ... you ... missing ?
migrant variant . autonomic dysfunction .
this is really , really fun , but i have a work deadline so --
jade , stand up for me , please .
what ?
stand up , please .
we didn &apos;t miss anything .
hi . freak show &apos;s over . can i go ?
that is what you missed .
i feel naked .
that nurse betsy -- her name was betsy --
she took my clothes , took them , sealed them in plastic .
she took all of my clothes .
i have on paper panties !
you know how paper panties feel ?
i imagine that there &apos;s some chafing .
okay .
listen , it &apos;s a chance to relax ,
so you should take a nap and get rid of your jet lag or read .
it &apos;s like a spa or a vacation .
i am in a bubble ! i am trapped in a bubble !
jackson -- he came in once .
he came in once , took a look at me ,
and then just walked away ,
and -- and i couldn &apos;t go after him
because the bubble does not travel .
no , it does not .
i am alone in here .
i am trapped like a bug , like some kind of nasty bug ,
and i &apos;m covered in disease .
you would think that - he would want to talk to me .
i am gonna die of a mysterious disease
with a chafed , buggy ass all alone !
oh , my god . don &apos;t freak out .
you &apos;ve been in here for like an hour .
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s jackson .
how can i help ?
um , just , uh , talk .
talk about something else -- anything .
okay . um , okay .
um ... yeah , oh . here &apos;s the thing .
um , callie met someone .
so , are you okay with that , or --
yeah , super . awesome .
okay , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s great , then .
yeah , i mean , i should be happy for her , right ?
and she sounds happy , you know , happier than she &apos;s ever been ,
she says -- i mean , apparently , like , forever happy .
do we have to talk about this ?
well , you know , she does ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s talking to everybody about it .
i &apos;m surprised she fit .
20 bucks she &apos;s over 7 feet .
i mean , is it drugs or the wrong combo of steroids , you think ?
i saw lebron at an airport once .
she &apos;s taller than him .
be quiet and stand outside .
do we think it &apos;s drugs ?
a growth hormone , maybe ?
it &apos;s definitely not drugs .
waiting for a scan to confirm it .
yeah , oh , i &apos;m right . you &apos;ll see .
oh , and just &apos; cause you &apos;re chief now ,
you &apos;re knower of all things ?
look , jade suffers from blurry vision , headaches , dizziness .
abnormal growth .
okay , put it all together , and you get ... ?
a pituitary tumor .
the knower of all things !
i should be chief of surgery .
oh , wait -- i already am .
you are welcome .
where have you been ?
i was downloading all the charts you asked for ,
which , respectfully , is a lot of charts .
are we really doing all of these surgeries today ?
well , bailey pushed all her patients onto me ,
so that means you , too .
kyle roane -- - can we push this lap chole --
no , we don &apos;t have his liver tests back yet .
what about dana lee ?
hernia repair -- do we have the urinalysis , because --
no , the labs are backed up .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
is there anything i can do
to make your day better , dr. grey ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
i can &apos;t say no to bailey because it &apos;s for the chief ,
so i just need a little break in the clouds here .
i just need a little rain .
i appreciate the apology .
where are you going ?
to make it rain .
thanks .
dr. wilson . you paged ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
oh , wow , that &apos;s weird . totally thought you did .
maybe this thing is old .
anyway , you waiting for your labs ?
can i , uh , can i wait --
oh , thank you , yeah .
bring me the labs when you get them .
oh , no , no , i meant wait ... with you .
why ?
i need to rush a patient &apos;s pre @-@ op .
i &apos;ve been waiting 10 minutes .
apparently , the system &apos;s down .
grey tasked me with all of these labs and these extra rounds ,
and i need to prep three patients for the o.r.
so , i -- this isn &apos;t gonna work for me .
what are you ... ?
uh , excuse me . hi .
i need the labs for dana lee , stat .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s for the chief .
we all wait in line here .
thank you so much .
bring me those labs .
can &apos;t wait .
how you doing ? oh , uh , hi , uh , bailey -- or -- or should i say chief ?
yes , sir .
okay .
i just heard about the case .
a big patient for a big first day ?
yes , sir .
uh , and do you want anything , a consult -- anything ?
oh , no , no . i got it covered .
thanks , though .
prelim results says
it &apos;s definitely not middle east respiratory syndrome .
so can i get out of here ?
well , they won &apos;t clear you to leave
until they get your gram @-@ stain results .
jackson .
i &apos;ve been gone for three months .
can we at least have a conversation ?
i have a , uh , consult .
i &apos;ll let you know when i get your gram @-@ stain results back .
wait , wait !
come on !
okay .
so , jade , you have two problems .
uh , in addition to the pituitary tumor there ,
the fall you took caused a fracture
in one of your vertebrae , so you will need surgery .
but more importantly ,
i need to remove the tumor as soon as possible .
no , no . no one cuts into my brain .
look , i &apos;m missing work .
um , jade , this tumor is causing your growth hormones
to be 16 times higher than normal , uh ,
w @-@ which means that you &apos;ll only continue to grow .
i &apos;ve been 6 &apos; 6 &quot; since i was 17 . who cares ?
actually , you &apos;re 7 &apos; 2 . &quot;
and a quarter -- uh , we measured .
you &apos;re growing at a rate faster than your body can handle .
any more force , and your spine will collapse .
well , how long will surgery take ?
making a surgical plan -- the surgery and recovery --
we can get you back to work in a week or so , mm @-@ hmm .
nope . look , i &apos;ll come back when ,
you know , my work project is over .
whoa , whoa ! sit .
chief , i need to do a repeat neuro check in four hours .
four hours ? no , i can &apos;t .
i know your work is important ,
but this brain surgery has to be your priority .
really ? do you know what i do ?
no . i lead a team that &apos;s bringing the internet
to the parts of africa that don &apos;t have it .
the internet is man getting fire .
this is the 21st @-@ century light bulb .
do you know how many lives will be changed , be saved ,
how many girls will become educated ?
do you know how much medical knowledge ,
how much information will become available
to people who &apos;ve been kept in the dark ?
this project goes live in one week , and i need to be there .
i have to be .
yeah . uh , that &apos;s --
more important than brain surgery .
jade , i hear you .
uh , you have the weight of the world on your shoulders .
but believe me when i tell you i can help you .
okay , i &apos;ll give you the four hours .
then i &apos;m leaving .
four hours ?
and in that time frame , i need a complete surgical plan
for resection of the pituitary tumor
and repair of the spinal fracture
that includes a recovery time of no more than a week .
oh ! okay , well , you know what ?
i have a knee replacement right now .
i &apos;ve got a vats procedure .
then push that and delegate that .
now , we have to move fast .
this woman has no interest in being treated .
you know what ? in fact , she &apos;s a flight risk .
wilson , you &apos;re in charge of making sure she stays put . go .
her tumor is massive .
i mean , we need extensive scans
and -- and time to go over an approach for both procedures .
uh , that -- that takes longer than four hours .
well , actually , uh , you have 3 hours and 36 minutes .
bailey , we need at least until the end of the day , okay ?
what you &apos;re asking for is impossible .
what ? i @-@ it &apos;s what ?
oh , i know you didn &apos;t say impossible .
no , nothing &apos;s impossible .
you are smart people .
you &apos;re good surgeons .
this patient has some big things to do ,
and i have every confidence that you will figure out
how she can do them .
bailey .
and make it possible .
it &apos;s possible , right ?
yeah , it &apos;s possible .
it &apos;s my victory as much as it is hers .
i mean , she was my candidate .
i was pulling for her .
and so what if i wanted to pass the torch
in a celebratory fashion ?
i mean , is that so terrible , huh ?
maybe offer a word of support or advice here or there .
i mean , not that she asked me .
she hasn &apos;t asked me for anything .
well , i suppose i could ask her if she minds if i join --
you know , i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have to ask her .
she should want me there .
i should &apos;ve been the first place she stopped .
no , but she &apos;s got it all handled .
and i @-@ i @-@ i worry .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s foolhardy .
you know , it &apos;s arrogance is what it is .
and i &apos;m gonna talk to her .
good talk . thanks , kepner .
feel better .
can you do a minimally invasive --
no , no , her vertebral bodies are too large .
we &apos;ll have to use an anterior approach through the chest .
i &apos;ll do a right thoracotomy .
i &apos;m gonna do a transcranial approach .
yeah , if bailey wants a shorter recovery ,
then an endonasal approach will help .
well , the tumor &apos;s too big .
the head is abnormally big . you &apos;re gonna have space .
i &apos;m doing a craniotomy . i need visibility .
i &apos;m gonna get you where you need to be with less bleeding , all right ?
just listen for a minute .
apparently , we don &apos;t have a minute .
avery , can you do a consult ?
no . no . no . no .
it &apos;s for one of bailey &apos;s patients .
of course it is .
she put all her services on hold to fix her giant problem .
she had me push two procedures for this .
she &apos;s doing it to you guys , too .
i mean , she postponed five of my consults
so i could handle her patients .
she didn &apos;t ask . she just pushed them .
it &apos;s ridiculous . no offense .
can she do that ?
can who do what ?
oh , can you be chief again ? i loved you as chief .
you did stay out of people &apos;s hair .
very hands @-@ off and great ties .
you know what they used to call her , her interns ?
what ?
the nazi .
bailey ?
last time she had absolute rule over people ,
and here she is again .
i love bailey , but -- power corrupts .
she &apos;s an iron @-@ fisted dictator .
she &apos;s a bond villain .
warren . i &apos;m so sorry .
we weren &apos;t trying to be disrespectful .
it &apos;s all good , it &apos;s all good .
i &apos;m just gonna go look into some follow @-@ up scans .
amelia .
what do you think ?
what ? me ?
i don &apos;t think -- don &apos;t ask me .
oh , dr. grey , i &apos;ve got o.r. four for the small bowel obstruction
and an angio suite for the swanson case .
i thought you said the angio suite was booked .
i have my ways .
let &apos;s go .
wait -- so , they called bailey the nazi ?
yeah .
yes .
what do you mean , &quot; don &apos;t ask me ? &quot;
you &apos;re more pissed off than any of us .
have you ever had a friend who was like a really good friend ,
but you just want to make out with &apos; em all the time ?
oh , yeah .
yeah , i used to do that for years .
and what happened ?
sofia .
question .
when you update the i and o &apos;s ,
is it kind of just like whenever you get to it or ... ?
um , i like to do it hourly .
sweet . i like that .
you like what ?
hourly .
it &apos;s , uh -- it &apos;s just --
it &apos;s like it &apos;s a good , round time frame ,
and there &apos;s one every hour , so you don &apos;t forget to --
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
that was really weak ...
... pathetic and sad .
whoa , where you going ?
gave you four hours . time &apos;s up .
no , no , no . you can &apos;t leave .
you can &apos;t hold me here . i &apos;m not a hostage .
no , i know , but , uh ...
oh , uh , bailey , may i have a word with you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . huge deadline , sir .
okay , where are we ?
we &apos;re nowhere .
oh , my god ! come on !
ugh ! this is ...
the tumor has invaded the cavernous sinus .
i &apos;m planning an approach .
the wrong approach .
and the recovery time that
you &apos;re asking for is completely unreasonable .
we need more time .
no , we don &apos;t have it .
uh , look , i have to go tell this woman something , so --
jade &apos;s left . she just walked out .
you let her ? ! i gave you one job !
dr. wilson was trying to reason with her ,
but she knows that we can &apos;t legally stop her .
or physically stop her .
well , convince her .
go find her and get her back here !
okay .
oh , i gave them one thing !
i gave you one thing !
and i started this day
thinking we could accomplish the impossible ,
but now i &apos;m gonna end the day
with a woman probably dead on the street
and a thousand african children who can &apos;t read .
i don &apos;t know what we were supposed to do .
more .
i expected more -- so damn much more .
what do a thousand african children have to do with this ?
jade ! please , you can &apos;t leave .
people are waiting for me .
i &apos;ll come back when i can .
no , no , no . there may be no coming back .
dr. bailey was right .
your symptoms suggest that surgery needs to happen now .
how many people can you help if you &apos;re dead or blind or ...
uh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna get you out of there .
no , don &apos;t touch her . jade , don &apos;t move .
let us through , please .
jade , are you all right ? !
i @-@ i @-@ i caught her head .
she didn &apos;t hit her head .
oh , my god .
oh , my . i &apos;m so stupid .
i &apos;m so stupid .
she might &apos;ve aggravated her spine fracture .
that &apos;s too small . it won &apos;t support her .
i got it .
uh , jade , just try not to move .
i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t move .
i can &apos;t feel my legs . they &apos;re numb .
okay , on my count -- one , two , three .
easy , easy . watch her neck .
good . and slide .
dr. wilson , are -- are you okay ?
can i get you anything ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
good job on the door , deluca . quick thinking .
yeah , you should be a contractor .
you still could . you &apos;re young .
jo , can we get an o.r. ?
one , two , three .
let &apos;s move .
and then today , i @-@ it &apos;s like i &apos;m invisible .
i mean , i don &apos;t know what it means .
maybe the kiss meant nothing and we &apos;re friends .
i mean , i guess what i &apos;m asking is ,
if it were you , if i kissed you -- wait .
no , i &apos;m not saying that you and i --
we &apos;re not -- we &apos;re not kissing ,
but if a guy kisses you and he asks you out
and then you refuse to look at him for the rest of the day ,
what exactly are you thinking ?
i can &apos;t help you .
my marriage is collapsing ,
and i can &apos;t do anything about it because he won &apos;t talk to me .
you see ? you get it .
no , i don &apos;t get it , because i &apos;m trapped in a bubble !
you are not trapped in a bubble .
you have the freedom to roam and talk to anyone you &apos;d like ,
so stop talking to me .
go talk to shepherd .
ask her what she thinks about it .
you know what ? you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
if i want a reaction , i should just force one .
i should just go right up to her and be direct .
i &apos;m saying stop talking to me !
oh , i need to go . hang in there , kepner .
hey , are we ready ?
uh , which approach are you going to use ?
jade &apos;s fall caused her spinal fracture
to become severely unstable ,
so pierce and i will have to repair it at the same time .
it &apos;s not ideal , but --
we sit jade up for a craniotomy ,
it would paralyze her forever .
so we &apos;ll be doing this surgery endonasally .
which is the wrong approach .
we &apos;re out of options .
warren , go scrub .
someone needs to sign off on the case .
all right , i will .
do they all hate me ?
i , uh -- i try not to listen .
so they &apos;re talking .
did i push too hard ?
uh , do you think i &apos;m wrong here ?
what do you think ?
i think i have put us all in a terrible position .
yeah , well , i think you &apos;re right .
and i &apos;m in one , too ,
so can i just ... work , please ?
so check the urine output and page me with any changes .
on it .
busy day .
has bailey talked to you about anything ?
talk ?
all she does is talk to me or at me .
she dumped her entire schedule on me
and expects me to get it all done today .
yeah , i &apos;ve been hearing that .
the only reason i &apos;m holding up is edwards .
i mean , she &apos;s on top of it .
i understand why amelia requests her .
edwards gets things done .
bone graft is in .
and ...
yeah , we &apos;re done .
warren , ease down on the retractor .
got it .
shepherd , how are we ?
if i can get in a little further ,
the margins will be close to perfect .
hold on . can you advance the scope ?
damn it .
what the hell happened ?
we hit the carotid .
i can &apos;t see a thing . avery , suction .
uh , how can we help ?
we need to compress this artery .
wilson , we need more packing in here -- now .
set up another suction .
blood &apos;s coming out of her mouth .
god , she &apos;s gonna bleed out .
we should &apos;ve opened her skull .
i knew this would happen !
just keep packing -- faster .
come on ! pack ! more !
pressure &apos;s down to 85 .
try 5 % albumin .
call for some ffp .
pressure &apos;s down to 75 .
more suction .
i still can &apos;t see a thing .
oh , hey , bailey .
so , your adenoma resection had a rebleed .
it &apos;s stable now .
but then mrs. what &apos;s her name with the lap chole --
grey , i can &apos;t right now .
bailey , these are your patients !
look , i @-@ i &apos;m happy you &apos;re chief .
i &apos;m all for it .
but i am taking my day to service your patients and mine ,
and it &apos;s getting done . i &apos;m on it .
but if you &apos;re gonna do this to me , if you &apos;re gonna drown me ,
at least take two seconds
to listen to the update of your patients .
i deserve more than to be dismissed .
i deserve more .
respectfully , chief .
chest tube is in .
guys , is there a plan here ?
because she &apos;s lost - a third of her blood volume .
i can do a muscle patch .
with a little glue , it could form a clot ,
and we can seal the vessel .
will that even work ?
no , that &apos;s a temporary fix .
we need to open her neck
and do a primary repair of the carotid ...
that &apos;s a major stroke risk .
... before she dies on the table .
wilson , prep the neck .
wilson , you keep suctioning .
who am i listening to ?
you need to listen to me !
you open her neck , she &apos;s gonna bleed out in seconds .
you let me do this ,
i can stop the bleeding and help you remove the tumor .
do not open her neck , please .
move .
all right , we can use a patch from the thoracotomy incision .
pierce , i need a piece of intercostal muscle right now , please .
scalpel .
that &apos;s for you .
i wanted to give it to you this morning ,
but somebody got herself in a big damn hurry .
it &apos;s mine .
i got it my first day of residency .
i , uh , replaced the earbuds .
i never had anyone to pass something along to .
but then ...
... i @-@ i just thought that --
sir , i don &apos;t deserve this .
well , if you think that , then maybe you don &apos;t --
because i &apos;m not the right person for this job .
you thought i was .
i thought i was ,
and i had these great plans , but ...
i mean , if this is my first day ,
then i don &apos;t deserve a second .
i wanted it to go --
perfectly . it won &apos;t .
it can &apos;t .
i mean , this job is too much for one person .
you did it .
because i listened to those who came before me
and counted on those under me .
i tried to --
no , you barked like a general .
they are generals .
they know how to mobilize .
what they need is a leader .
if i did my job well , it &apos;s not because people listened to me .
it &apos;s because they believed in me ...
believed that i knew them well enough
and believed in them enough
to tell them how and when to use their brains .
i &apos;m talking about people like you .
that kind of belief you have to earn ,
and you cannot earn it in a day .
you want someone to run a four @-@ minute mile ,
you don &apos;t chase them .
you don &apos;t give them something to run from .
you give them something to run to .
avery , we need something else .
give it a chance .
shepherd is right . it &apos;s not holding .
don &apos;t move the patch . just give it time .
uh , we could try embolization .
go up through the groin , coil it .
it &apos;ll take too long to get a c @-@ arm in here .
there !
oh , my god .
it &apos;s holding . are we okay ?
i hope so .
yeah , me , too .
dr. avery . it &apos;s dr. kepner .
911 .
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s happened ?
we need to talk .
god , april , i thought you were dying !
i kind of am dying . i feel like we both are .
you paged me 911 so we could do this ? !
yes ! yes !
okay . - i needed - to force a reaction out of you
because i am in a glass prison and i can &apos;t do anything .
so you &apos;re gonna stand there , and you &apos;re not gonna walk away
and you &apos;re gonna talk to me .
you don &apos;t want to hear it .
jackson , i -- - we already talked , april .
i told you what i needed , and you didn &apos;t hear it .
you didn &apos;t listen .
you went - halfway around the damn world .
that wasn &apos;t a talk , jackson .
that was an ultimatum , and our marriage
has never been - a marriage of ultimatums . - oh , come on .
it wasn &apos;t an ultimatum . i gave you a choice .
no .
no , i made a choice long before that ,
long before samuel ,
the army , any of it , and so did you .
we stood up
in that weird @-@ smelling little chapel in tahoe ,
and before god , we chose to love one another
until we die .
you made that choice .
we chose to love and honor one another --
honor one another , which you couldn &apos;t do ...
in front of god ,
we promised each other that , through -- -
telling you that i needed you to stay .
i needed to go !
and you went !
you did what you needed to do -- twice , actually .
this marriage is full of ultimatums .
they &apos;re all yours .
look , we ...
we &apos;ve been through a lot .
and you &apos;ve changed .
no .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve grown .
and --
we haven &apos;t been through a lot .
jackson , we &apos;re going through a lot right now .
we &apos;re going through a hard part .
this is -- this is the worse of &quot; for better or worse . &quot;
this is the mud ,
and we just have to pull each other through it .
we just -- we have to push , and we have to fight .
i &apos;m not sure we are worth fighting for .
what ?
no , please don &apos;t --
ow ! god !
so , where are we with jade ?
i got the whole tumor .
she had a ... bad left carotid bleed .
i took her to angio , put in a stent .
but she &apos;s likely to have deficits --
possibly a stroke , paralysis ...
she &apos;s still out .
... speech and language issues , vision loss .
pressure &apos;s good , but we won &apos;t know .
or she could just be in a coma .
you people are extraordinary .
i mean , i came in here today and did
all kinds of things wrong ,
but in spite of that ,
you all still did amazing
and perfect work .
and you found a way to do something
that was , in fact , impossible .
so if there is a bad outcome ,
it &apos;s my bad outcome .
tomorrow ...
i will be better .
hey , cross . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re prepping o.r. five for grey &apos;s lab chole .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
dr. wilson has me today .
it &apos;s for the chief .
now , cross . come .
no , stay .
you &apos;ve cut lines , y @-@ y @-@ you &apos;ve stolen nurses ,
you &apos;ve even rearranged the o.r. board .
you are not stealing him . he is mine -- mine .
back off .
uh , if the chief needs him for grey , you got to let him go .
thank you , dr. karev .
cross . come . -
i &apos;ll come back . -
alex , she &apos;s lying .
she &apos;s been pulling this crap all day ,
saying it &apos;s &quot; for the chief . &quot;
she &apos;s so full of it .
stop .
stop what ?
stop whining .
look , she worked you .
she got what she wanted by beating the system .
it &apos;s a genius move .
if i had come up with it , i would &apos;ve .
look , you &apos;re just mad that you didn &apos;t .
deal with it or come up with something better .
what are you doing ?
i checked with griggs . you &apos;re clear .
i mean , he was leaving , so he asked me to let you out .
so i &apos;m not sick .
most likely contact dermatitis .
told him that 12 hours ago .
um , and , uh , look -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry if ,
you know , i hurt you .
we have to be honest with each other .
you were just being honest . i appreciate that .
thank you .
i mean , you &apos;re wrong .
april . - but we are - something worth fighting for ,
and i want to fight .
so i &apos;ll fight for the both of us .
i will launch a full @-@ scale assault .
i will ambush and slash and burn
and fight until i am bloody for us .
i will fight to the death because i vowed to .
and nothing that &apos;s happened since then has changed that .
you see ? this is it .
you just want what you want .
you don &apos;t care what i think .
i love you too much to let my mistake end our marriage .
i won &apos;t break my promise to you , so i &apos;m gonna fight .
and i &apos;m gonna win .
oh , arizona !
hey .
here . sofia forgot this .
we &apos;re on , uh -- we made it to page 12 .
she is exhausted ,
so you can probably get away with an early bedtime .
thanks .
hey , um , big date ?
oh . you heard ?
yeah , i mean , everyone heard .
you know , you can tell me , callie .
you can always tell me .
yeah ?
yeah .
you &apos;d like her .
she &apos;s funny and sharp
and , um , we don &apos;t just find the same things funny --
we say the same thing at the same time .
it &apos;s really almost like --
okay , no , yeah , you can dial back the enthusiasm .
no , really .
it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s like we share the same brain .
i mean , read the room . that &apos;s all .
well , all i &apos;m saying is ... you &apos;d like her .
hi .
hi .
why won &apos;t you talk to me ?
what --
you won &apos;t even look at me , so help me out , okay ?
i mean , are you -- are you upset , angry , confused , or --
that one . i &apos;m confused .
if i --
if i had to pick one .
well , then let &apos;s talk about it so we can --
i can &apos;t talk about it because then we start all the kissing ,
and i don &apos;t know why . i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know what it means .
what does it mean ?
what do you think it means ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , then ...
maybe ...
we should ...
we should talk about it .
okay .
let &apos;s talk .
jade .
jade , can you hear me ?
now can i get out of here ?
oh , yes .
oh , you will soon enough .
ah , yeah .
oh , grey - just the person i needed to see .
a hot appy came in tonight .
now , it hasn &apos;t ruptured , but you need to do --
am i being punished for yelling at you ?
on the contrary .
it &apos;s fine . i just need to know .
oh , you don &apos;t think you deserved my piling my service on you .
no .
i believe you do .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna let you in on a secret .
see , when webber had this job , it was easier for him .
and hunt had it easier than i do .
you know why ?
i don &apos;t .
because they had me .
i need a me , and i believe that you can be a me for me .
i need you to be my me .
i &apos;d like to appoint you chief of general surgery .
me ?
because you deserve it .
because you can take it .
because i leaned on you , and you held me up .
you are the calm in the center of the chaos .
you have been since i met you .
and i need you .
you want it or not ?
yes .
go see this appy , and don &apos;t complain to me again .
without a strong leader ,
the whole machine &apos;s out of whack .
congratulations , dr. grey .
now when you tell people you need something for the chief ,
it really will be .
that &apos;s right -- i know what you &apos;ve been saying today .
but it &apos;s pretty simple --
if the brain &apos;s working , the body will listen .
your limbs want to hold you up .
your lungs want to breathe .
your heart wants to beat .
but none of them are any good 
without the brain .
aren &apos;t you exhausted ?
i just need to make sure that i &apos;m prepared for tomorrow .
the brain keeps everything all together ...
look , you gonna be great tomorrow .
besides ...
oh , wait .
there are better ways to get prepared .
chief .
like a boss .
