we &apos;re having a look in toby &apos;s locker .
why ? do you think he &apos;s hiding in there ?
so , where is toby now ?
we don &apos;t know .
someone made a copy of alison &apos;s bracelet .
yeah , and made sure that we would find it .
let &apos;s get real .
in theory , we are a lot more wrong than we are right .
i don &apos;t remember doing anything to get you this mad at me .
it &apos;s me , you ... you &apos;re great .
alison was just straight up evil .
you put something online ,
somebody somewhere &apos;s willing to buy it .
i really appreciate this , lucas .
that corner of the park is going to be a safe place
where you can go and sit and just think .
you should think about alison while you &apos;re there .
who do you want to take there ?
are you moving out ?
i would never do that to you or your brother .
alison told me how you even threatened toby
if he told the truth .
she said she was afraid of you .
is that why one of you did what you did ?
this is insane .
how many words do they expect you to learn in one night ?
stringent .
uh , tough . inflexible .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re gonna actually use &apos; em .
meretricious .
i mean , it &apos;s not like you go to college
and you just start speaking a completely different language .
it &apos;s about getting into college .
meretricious , um , phony , flashy ?
mm @-@ hmm .
oh , hanna , why are you still eating that ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s here .
put it in the garbage .
then i &apos;d have to stand over the garbage and eat it .
besotted .
infatuated , enamored , in love with .
hey , what did noel kahn say to you after the memorial ?
hello , we are taking the s.a.t.s in less than 12 hours .
can we focus ?
okay , spencer ,
you do not need to know any more big words .
you &apos;re already scary enough to anyone under 50 .
i &apos;m not scary ! am i scary ?
a little .
hey , i saw noel kahn hug you ,
and he did not wanna let go .
talk about not wanting to let something go .
why can &apos;t you give him a chance ?
he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s cute ,
his dad owns , like , half of rhode island ,
and he &apos;s got great lips .
his father ?
no . ew .
seriously , aria , you and noel
would look amazing together .
can we just drop it , please ?
i &apos;m not looking for anything more than a friend .
why ? don &apos;t you have enough on facebook ?
besides , don &apos;t you want someone real ,
someone you can , i don &apos;t know , scratch and sniff ?
wow . maybe you should just eat that over the garbage .
look , i am trying to help out a friend here .
we don &apos;t all have smoking hot ball boys
from the country club .
what is going on with you and alex ?
is he back from that tournament ?
yeah . he &apos;s back .
and ?
and it &apos;s ... good .
it &apos;s so good .
i want it to last , but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna blow it .
so , when can we officially call him the boyfriend ?
hi , mom .
hey , mrs. hastings .
hi , girls . oh , what smells so good ?
garlic bread . want some ?
i can &apos;t . god , i miss food .
eat some butter for me , will you ?
why do i have so many messages ?
hey , maybe you should ask alex to--
stop . not now .
your mom still doesn &apos;t know ?
like i said , i want it to last .
where &apos;s emily ?
she &apos;s probably on her way over .
咱俩的事还没完呢 - a
you don &apos;t have to come inside , mom .
if it were cancelled , nobody would be here .
oh , excuse me . hi .
are they actually gonna give this test today ?
decision hasn &apos;t been made yet .
can you tell me who makes that decision ?
they &apos;re predicting a major storm .
you didn &apos;t say alex was taking the test here , too .
why do you think i wanted my mom to drop us off and leave ?
hey , you .
hi .
spence ...
nobody here can make a decision to save their life .
it &apos;s absurd .
um , mom ?
this is alex santiago .
alex , this is my mother .
alex , that i went to homecoming with ?
of course .
hi .
from the club .
yeah .
it just took me a moment to put it together .
so , you &apos;re alex .
listen , uh , i need to check in .
um , nice seeing you . meeting you .
test is on today .
rosewood students should register in the library .
but , like , half the school isn &apos;t here yet .
and may never make it .
we saw this huge tree down on sawmill road ,
and they &apos;ve already closed off york street .
that wasn &apos;t because of a tree .
york street &apos;s been closed since last night .
why ?
somebody decided to pay a visit
to alison dilaurentis &apos;s memorial
and destroy it .
shattered the tiles , broke the bench .
w @-@ when did this happen ?
we had to cordon off the area ,
given it &apos;s an ongoing murder investigation .
maybe you can spare them the details .
they &apos;re about to take their s.a.t.s.
right . good luck on the test , ladies .
we should probably get to the library .
give me a sec , would you ?
still haven &apos;t heard from toby , huh ?
no .
well , let me know when you do .
alison &apos;s memorial was vandalized last night .
and toby was spotted at a gas station
just off the interstate a few days ago ,
so clearly he &apos;s still with us .
but why would he run away
if he didn &apos;t have anything to hide ?
any idea where he might be staying ?
i don &apos;t know anything about it .
well , you should check your basement .
can &apos;t believe it was trashed ...
just when you thought that &quot; a &quot; would give it a rest .
it &apos;s like toby had to kill alison all over again .
toby ? what do you mean , toby ?
his motorcycle was totaled . isn &apos;t he dead ?
i hear more from alison now than when she was alive .
you guys , i thought we decided
&quot; a &quot; wasn &apos;t toby .
&quot; a &quot; was happy to have toby out of the picture .
how do we know that toby didn &apos;t just send that text ?
and why are we suddenly trusting &quot; a &quot; ?
&quot; a &quot; made a fake bracelet to mess with us .
emily , hey , where &apos;ve you been ?
yeah , why weren &apos;t you at spencer &apos;s last night ?
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t get out of practice till really late , so ...
just went straight home and crashed .
so , what have i missed ?
well , we studied .
they studied and i annoyed them .
and alison &apos;s memorial got trashed .
yeah . i heard .
what is my mom doing here ?
mom , what are you doing here ?
oh , i tried calling you ,
but your phone must be turned off for the test .
why are you here ? they called
and said they needed proctors . i &apos;m on the sub list .
you are ? since when ?
well , since they cut my hours at the gallery
and i &apos;m paying rent to live above it .
i filled out an application last monday .
what , to teach ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
well , sweetie , i was going to
when you came over for dinner ,
but then you canceled on monday ... and tuesday ,
and then on wednesday .
yeah , this week &apos;s been intense .
i understand .
i just , you know , i would like to see you in the flesh .
but you don &apos;t really plan on ever coming over , do you ?
i can &apos;t .
look , if i did , it &apos;d be like saying
i &apos;m okay with you and dad living apart .
but we are .
i know !
just &apos; cause you were ready for this doesn &apos;t mean that i am .
i gotta get back to the library .
hello ?
ashley , it &apos;s byron montgomery .
oh . hey . how are you ?
i &apos;m kinda screwed .
i &apos;ve got this fax to send , and we &apos;ve just lost power .
is it out on your side of the street , too ?
no . it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re welcome to come over here if you need to use the fax .
really ? well , listen , i don &apos;t want to disturb you .
no , it &apos;s okay . i was just , um ...
ordering something from a catalogue ,
but you can come over .
great . listen , um ...
do you mind if i use your toaster , too ?
i &apos;ll bring my own bread .
uh , you may also want to bring your own jelly .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
the test will now begin at 10 : 00 .
if this interferes with any plans you &apos;ve made for the afternoon ,
i suggest you make some calls .
if you didn &apos;t bring a phone ,
i am sure this tap @-@ happy gentleman over here
would be glad to lend you his .
what ? was she talking to me ?
you didn &apos;t miss anything .
do you want to borrow my phone ?
your brain . can you do the math section for me ?
hey , i &apos;m already your marketing manager .
you just got three hits on your leather jacket .
hey , there , lady &quot; h. &quot;
i know you also answer to that , hermie ,
but i was talking to her .
nice bag .
listen to you , in touch with your feminine side !
so , would that be your right or your left ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
nothing . you need to sign in .
they know i &apos;m here . you can go now .
this beauty doesn &apos;t need a beast .
去看看吧 - a
who would i speak to about getting into the boys &apos; locker room ?
i &apos;d have to find a custodian . do you want to follow me ?
no , that &apos;s all right . i &apos;m gonna wait here .
he &apos;s freaking me out !
whose locker is he poking into now ?
he &apos;s desperate . ali &apos;s brother &apos;s breathing down his neck .
ours too . what if jason told the police
alison &apos;s version of what happened after the fire ?
if jason was gonna tell them , he would &apos;ve told them a year ago .
he knows that story &apos;s bogus .
well , then , why do they bring it up ?
to try to drive a wedge between us ?
well , he &apos;s not gonna do that .
sorry about the memorial .
i know how hard you girls worked on it .
shocking though , right , something like that
could happen out in the open
and nobody saw anything ?
well , everybody here was probably studying
for the exam that we &apos;re about to take ,
so you might wanna look for eyewitnesses somewhere else .
so you were all studying together last night , then ?
yes , we were all at spencer &apos;s .
all of you ?
yes . all of us .
okay .
emily , what is going on ?
where were you last night ?
i told you . i went home .
then why didn &apos;t you tell him that ?
what happened to all of us sticking together ?
where are you going ?
to the restroom , but if you don &apos;t believe me
we can all try and squeeze into one stall .
should one of us go talk to her ?
no . she &apos;ll talk when she &apos;s ready .
谁是下一个 - a
alex , hey .
oh , hey .
hey . are you taking the test in here , too ?
if we ever take it . only eight kids showed up from my school .
um ... listen .
i don &apos;t know what happened
between you and my mom at the club .
i know she can be kind of a handful .
i &apos;ve seen her send back a napkin because it had ,
like , a loose thread .
i think i should look at my math stuff .
i can &apos;t talk about this .
okay .
okay , what gives ?
why is he / she into me ?
he &apos;s not into you .
he helped me sell that bag .
you bought it online , right ?
well , it &apos;s mine .
excuse me ?
that &apos;s not the original handle .
i broke it on a roller coaster at jolly roger &apos;s .
you bought my bag .
yeah , i knew that ! i bought it as a goof .
really ?
yes .
but forget about me . what &apos;s going on with you ?
you &apos;ve befriended somebody from a different species ,
and you &apos;ve turned your closet into a swap meet .
what are you , poor now ?
no , i just didn &apos;t want that bag anymore .
i &apos;ll give you back your money .
don &apos;t bother . take my andrew jacksons
and introduce them to your benjamin franklin .
put it towards my birthday present .
i registered at saks .
you need something ?
uh , no .
if this test isn &apos;t happening ,
are we allowed to leave the room ?
they just posted a tornado watch in delaware county .
no one &apos;s going anywhere . have a seat .
tell me you &apos;re a basketball fan .
why ?
got floor seats to the sixers game friday night .
they &apos;re playing the celtics .
no . that &apos;s really sweet--
it &apos;s not a date .
i mean , it &apos;s a date , but it &apos;s not a date @-@ date .
i think i already have plans .
okay .
another time , another season .
do you like hockey ?
never mind , no girl likes hockey .
i &apos;ll work on this .
wait , where are you going ?
they said we couldn &apos;t leave the building .
there are other rooms around here that are more fun than this .
wanna come ?
so , how do you like your toast--
barely warm , or burnt to a crisp ?
uh , whatever &apos;s easier .
barely warm it is !
uh , wait , no . listen , let &apos;s just wait a second .
the lights will come back on .
i better look for some candles .
no , no . no , no , don &apos;t do that .
the power is gonna come back on .
it has to . this was due yesterday .
what is it ?
uh , jeez . it &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a permission slip .
my son is on a lacrosse trip ,
and i forgot to send in his permission slip .
ella always handled this stuff , and i ...
i just forgot .
i can &apos;t keep up .
can you call the coach ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
you know , i &apos;m not doing very well at this ...
this whole , uh , single @-@ parent thing .
everything is just falling through the cracks .
you &apos;ve only been on your own for a couple weeks , byron .
you should cut yourself some slack .
do you play ?
shh , it &apos;s a secret .
why ?
my parents have this recurring nightmare
i &apos;ll bail on college and beg for quarters in the subway .
i know that .
my parents listened to it .
they--they used to .
so intense .
i could play louder .
what &apos;s so funny ?
their names .
pip . mr. wopsle . uncle pumblechook ..
they all sound like stuffed animals .
i can &apos;t believe you already finished it .
want me to tell you what happens ?
i can make you a cheat sheet .
you know , you should really let me braid your hair sometime .
i had a dream last night about jenna .
emily , don &apos;t .
okay , stop thinking about that .
there &apos;s all sorts of operations and stuff they can do .
i dreamt that she came back and she was fine .
she could see perfectly , and she forgave us .
that &apos;s why i love you .
you &apos;re big on happy endings .
so is dickens , by the way .
pip gets estella in the end .
can i read you something ?
&quot; i loved her against reason ,
against promise , against peace ,
against hope , against happiness ,
against all discouragement that could be . &quot;
did you get to that part yet ?
they want everybody in the library .
safety reasons .
aria , are you coming ?
um , yeah , yeah . i &apos;ll be right down .
i just-- have to ask mr. fitz a few homework questions .
so , you &apos;re back .
i never left .
you were out .
were you sick ?
i only ask because you never answered
my calls ... or my e @-@ mails .
i went to new york .
why ?
to ... deal with family issues .
family issues !
my issues .
i needed to clear my head .
okay , are you clear ?
do you know what you want ?
i interviewed at another school , and ...
so what you want is to not be here at all .
will you please let me finish ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve just gotten used to filling in the blanks myself .
you tell me at homecoming
that you got a haircut for me ,
and then you just fall off the face of the earth ?
i spent days thinking about you !
i thought about you every second i was gone .
but i also thought about the consequences ,
the questions from the principal ,
the school board , your parents .
my parents ?
we just can &apos;t go back to the way it was .
things need to change .
no , they already have .
mm . i think i just lost service .
hanna just sent me a text .
girls are fine .
oh , good .
do you want an ice cube for that ?
we should use &apos; em before they melt .
do you know ...
why ella left ?
does everyone on the street know ?
well , at least one person &apos;s
still willing to let me use her fax .
i don &apos;t take sides .
i know that things are never black and white .
it &apos;s so bizarre , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , you spend this huge chunk of your life as a couple ,
and then suddenly you &apos;re not ... a couple .
you may as well just disappear .
it &apos;s almost like you don &apos;t exist .
i had the same conversation a while back ... to myself in the mirror .
took me months before i went to see a movie alone .
what did you see .
transformers 2 .
i thought i wouldn &apos;t run into anyone over 12 ...
but i forgot they have parents , and ...
i spent the first half of the movie
dodging a coworker and his wife ,
and the second half crying into my popcorn .
why ?
&apos;cause it seemed like i was the only one there
who didn &apos;t have anyone to share popcorn with .
yeah . yeah , i hear ya .
see , i &apos;ve got this faculty dinner to go to next saturday night ,
and honestly , i don &apos;t think i can do it .
it &apos;s at this moroccan restaurant out by campus .
i &apos;m not very adventurous
with foods i can &apos;t pronounce .
ella was my taste @-@ tester .
you should call me .
i &apos;ll walk you through the menu .
why don &apos;t you come with me and make sure i don &apos;t eat goat ?
i &apos;ve been there . they do a very nice goat .
move ! all the way in , people !
you don &apos;t need to touch every locker .
come on !
this sucks .
first time i get to photograph a real tornado ,
and they shove us in a room without windows .
you don &apos;t want to see a real tornado .
of course he does . he wants to get to oz
so he can ask the wizard for a penis .
mona , can i talk to you for a sec ?
why can &apos;t you leave him alone ?
what has he ever done to you ?
besides remind you that two short years ago , we were him .
he bugs me .
yeah , well , i think you &apos;re the one who needs a trip to oz .
see if the wizard can find you a heart .
hey , i don &apos;t think this test is gonna happen today .
you can take a break .
not all of us sailed through trig .
alex , are we ever gonna get past this ?
past what ?
whatever happened between you and my mom .
you don &apos;t have to talk about it--
it &apos;s not up to me to tell you . it &apos;s up to your mother .
i need to find a french family
that &apos;s dying to host a nice girl from pennsylvania .
paris would be so awesome .
roll out of bed ,
eat a croissant , shop for two hours ,
take a nap in the louvre ,
eat another croissant , shop for two hours .
oh , have you seen this ?
i got it in the french catalogue .
they have them in , like , every color .
do me a favor ? hook it for me , would you ?
what are you doing ?
nothing . i just ...
you just what ?
just because we kissed in the library , emily ,
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m into you like that .
a kiss is a kiss .
i like boys ...
and trust me , if i &apos;m kissing you ,
it &apos;s because it &apos;s practice for the real thing .
where are you going ?
you &apos;re my ride , remember ?
hello ? is someone here ?
my god !
what &apos;s happening ?
hello ?
is someone here ?
where is my bag ?
where is the letter ?
mr. fitz ? hi .
uh , they need first aid supplies , too .
is somebody hurt ?
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s just a preventative measure .
i &apos;m ella montgomery , aria &apos;s mom ?
we met--
at the theater .
i @-@ i remember .
well , of course you would . why wouldn &apos;t you ?
we practically met in the dark .
why are these lights working ?
uh , emergency fixtures ?
i guess the generator just kicked in .
do you think they have anything to eat in here ?
we &apos;ve got some jangled nerves out there ,
and i think food would really help .
well , why don &apos;t we take a look under here ?
uh , how are you doing ... with the storm ?
oh , me ? i love this weather ,
as long as i don &apos;t have to fly through it .
which , if we were on a plane right now ,
i &apos;d probably be in your lap .
uh , how many waters do we need ?
uh , i would bring them all .
can you shine that over here ?
sure .
you would think they &apos;d have protein bars or something .
did they at least open the school cafeteria this morning ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . i got here late .
drove back from new york .
you did ?
in this weather , that &apos;s dedication .
no wonder aria talks so highly about you .
well , i am grateful to have her in my class .
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s very engaged .
good .
can i ask you a question ?
s @-@ s @-@ sure .
have you noticed any changes in aria in the past few weeks ?
um ...
i only ask because , um , my husband and i ,
we separated , and i was wondering if and how
that &apos;s affecting aria at school .
it &apos;s not really a question you can directly ask your kid .
of course not . i &apos;m sorry ...
about you and your husband .
as far as aria goes , i haven &apos;t noticed anything ,
um ... alarming .
good .
she &apos;s very strong .
yeah . yeah .
but she puts up a good front ,
and , um , when she &apos;s hurt
and she wants to shut you out ,
you could die of frostbite .
oh , protein bars .
excuse me .
sure .
you know , i &apos;m really glad
that she has you in her life right now ,
an adult that she admires .
looks like we &apos;ll have to make ...
we &apos;re gonna have to make a couple of trips .
hey , everything okay with mr. fitz ?
yeah , uh , just had a few questions .
he was out last week .
you have an incredible voice . we should do that again .
emily , you &apos;ve been in there this whole time ?
i didn &apos;t hear the announcement .
i was looking for my purse .
it &apos;s probably still in the library .
look , em , if you were hooking up with maya last night ,
you can tell aria and spencer .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m just saying it doesn &apos;t have to be this huge secret .
it &apos;s not like i fell apart .
okay , can we not talk about this in here ?
look , i &apos;m just saying you can trust them .
emily , i think we found something that belongs to you .
could you come with me , please ?
emily ! let &apos;s go .
is that your bag on the table ?
where &apos;d you find it ?
i shouldn &apos;t have to tell you
that leaving a bag unattended in a public place ,
not a very smart move .
what is going on ?
oh , perfect ! we can all be together for an update .
no , we &apos;re supposed to be in the girls &apos; locker room .
well , i &apos;m guessing you girls
are used to being in places you &apos;re not supposed to be .
did you tell your friends where you were last night ,
when you weren &apos;t studying for the test ?
see , &apos; cause i got these really interesting photos .
go ahead and pass it around .
there &apos;s plenty more where that came from at the precinct .
and i see you didn &apos;t get a chance to clean your shoes either , huh ?
that &apos;s not why i went there .
really ? so you didn &apos;t go back to the memorial
to finish up toby &apos;s handiwork ?
or were you just there covering up his tracks ?
i found it like that . it was already destroyed .
really ?
then let me ask you a question .
what were these doing in your bag ?
souvenirs ? something toby asked you to save
so he can keep it for his trophy collection ?
this has nothing to do with toby !
em , why do you have those ?
you put those in there , you creep .
emily would never do that .
the memorial was her idea .
yeah , so i heard .
nice cover , huh ?
you want me to share this with them ,
or would you like to ?
go ahead and tell them about the angry letter
that you wrote to alison ...
which is dated , by the way ,
three days before she disappeared .
you had no right to read that .
emily , what is in that letter ?
tell her . tell her how you wanted
to punish alison for rejecting you .
tell her how you felt relieved at the funeral .
yeah , she wasn &apos;t gonna be around to humiliate you anymore , was she ?
i went back to that memorial to say i was sorry .
there were horrible things in that letter ,
and i didn &apos;t mean them .
suddenly she was gone , and ...
i loved her as more than a friend .
i just never had the chance to tell her in the right way .
give her the letter back . give it back to her now ,
or i swear to god ,
i will rip your head off !
sorry , i can &apos;t .
and we &apos;re not leaving this room
until you tell me what you were doing
carting around pieces of alison &apos;s memorial .
i took them because they
were the only things that weren &apos;t broken .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
why aren &apos;t they in the locker room with the other kids ?
who are you ?
her mother . i mean , if this is the school &apos;s idea
of keeping my child safe , i &apos;m glad i came back .
honey , why is she crying ?
he accused her of killing alison .
what ?
he went through her purse
and now he &apos;s accusing--
hold it . hold it .
you &apos;re questioning minors without an adult present ?
what police department do you work for ?
what century are you in ?
ma &apos;am , i would advise you--
no , i would advise you to back off ,
because anything that they &apos;ve said to you
is inadmissible in a courtroom , period .
let &apos;s go .
emily , honey , grab your things .
what were you thinking ?
i have a homicide to solve , okay ?
not anymore you don &apos;t . you &apos;re done .
you &apos;re done with this investigation ,
unless you want to face me down with the opposing counsel
so , what &apos;s gonna happen to him ?
can they get him off the force ?
if he &apos;s smart , he &apos;ll leave before that happens .
oh , where did he get that protein bar ?
oh . i &apos;ll get you one .
em .
i wish i &apos;d known .
hey , alison loved you ,
and i don &apos;t know if it was in the way
that you wanted her to , but i know that she did .
can i have your attention , please ?
the storm warning has just been lifted ,
but the s.a.t. will have to be rescheduled .
you looking for somebody ?
alex , but ...
he might &apos;ve already left .
didn &apos;t you bring an umbrella ?
yeah .
mom , thank you for stopping in .
it was pro bono . let &apos;s go .
wait , i--
i really can &apos;t sit in the car the whole ride home
without asking what happened between you and alex .
what did he say ?
nothing . he won &apos;t talk about it .
oh , my god . this requires closing a door .
maybe i should just walk home .
remember that weekend when your father
took you and melissa to d.c. ? i stayed behind .
yeah ...
i said i had to work all weekend ,
but that wasn &apos;t the truth .
i spent most of friday drunk .
sunday i was hung over .
saturday i don &apos;t remember at all .
okay , i think i actually changed my mind .
i really don &apos;t need to know .
i started at the club friday morning .
it was empty . there wasn &apos;t a soul to talk to ,
so i ordered a sidecar ,
then another and another .
by the time lunch rolled around ,
i &apos;d walked through a trellis
and couldn &apos;t find my shoes .
it was alex &apos;s first week there .
he kindly listened to me spill my guts ,
and later poured me into a cab .
with my shoes .
why were you spilling your guts to alex ?
i had a doctor &apos;s appointment before i went there .
they removed a lump from my breast .
i was feeling a little overwhelmed ...
and powerless .
after that , i avoided the club for months .
the next time i saw alex , i made him promise
that he would never , ever bring it up .
mom , are you sick ?
no .
well , why didn &apos;t you and dad tell us ?
what makes you think your dad knows ?
spencer ... our family
doesn &apos;t handle imperfection very well .
mom ,
being sick is not an imperfection .
just so you know ,
i gave up sidecars for spritzers .
and by the way ... alex is a lovely kid .
he &apos;s a keeper .
i &apos;m impressed .
you could do brain surgery with those hands .
no , honestly , i can do a pedicure .
hey .
whoa .
okay , let &apos;s-- hey , let &apos;s try this again .
okay . wait .
i think it already went .
&quot; transmission received . &quot; there you go .
fantastic . well , i owe you big time .
all right , you &apos;re off the hook for carpool this week .
i will drive hanna to school every day ,
and i &apos;ll see you for dinner on saturday night .
right ! saturday .
you know what , i don &apos;t know what i was thinking , actually .
i can &apos;t have dinner at that moroccan restaurant this saturday .
mike has a scrimmage game late in the afternoon ,
and i promised i would take his team out afterwards .
yeah , actually , saturday isn &apos;t ...
good for me , either .
but w @-@ we &apos;ll figure out something .
definitely .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
for this .
mm @-@ hmm .

hey .
i just wanted to say i think we should--
have that date @-@ date .

i think i &apos;m having dinner at my mom &apos;s on friday ,
but how about saturday ?
yeah , works for me .
hey .
what was that for ?
i can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s a secret .
so , 96 bucks for your leather jacket .
going ... going ...
gone . cool ! that was easy .
listen , um ... i don &apos;t know what you said to mona ,
but thank you .
she actually made it through two hours
in the locker room without spitting on me .
yeah , you don &apos;t need to thank me .
yeah , i do .
no , you don &apos;t . i &apos;m your friend ... geek .
hanna ...
