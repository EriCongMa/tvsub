the storm
peter lewis . he had two very biological parents
and they ran the foster home .
this has to be where all the victims stayed
before they were adopted and their names were changed .
it looks like we found mr. scratch .
i win .
he surrendered .
he surrendered ? that doesn &apos;t make sense .
antonia slade .
she was a serial killer captured 15 years ago , right ?
she started this runaway hotline
in order to lure her preferred victims ,
young teens , to her home .
what happened to your baby , antonia ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
but as a reward for being so clever ,
i will tell you this .
there &apos;s a storm coming , agent hotchner .
and you &apos;re about to be swept away .
ohh , this reminds me of that morning in budapest .
as i recall , that particular breakfast lasted all day .
well , we could try that again .
except you &apos;d have to call in sick .
that &apos;s very tempting .
oh . joy wants to facetime .
well , you should get it .
no ! she &apos;ll recognize your house .
i can &apos;t lie to her .
then don &apos;t .
let &apos;s just tell her we &apos;re just seeing each other again .
you &apos;re happy , i &apos;m happy .
she will be , too .
this is a big deal , and i just think that we should ...
tell her when she comes to visit .
good .
do you think she knows ?
she &apos;s a reporter .
i think she might have a hunch .
the thing is , you have to take the time or it just flies by .
i know .
i &apos;ve heard alaskan cruises are pretty amazing .
mom has a phobia .
of water or--
cruise ships , specifically .
ok . but she &apos;s good to fly ?
yeah .
ok , so there &apos;s gotta be a place
she &apos;s always mentioned she wanted to go .
what &apos;s the first thing that pops into your head ?
uh , it &apos;s paris , actually .
wow . done . book that .
you &apos;re right . thank you .
if we &apos;re talking about vacations ,
guess where i &apos;m going .
hmm . to visit emily ?
yes . how did you know that ?
because nothing else would make you this excited .
have you ever been to london before ?
yes . one time , 4 years ago . it was work / play .
this is gonna be all play . i am leaving all my phones at home .
you &apos;re right . that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m going to bring them all ,
but i &apos;m going to put them on airplane mode most of the time .
yeah . baby steps .
that &apos;s right , mate .
oh , i am putting the kettle on .
would anyone like a proper cup ?
yeah .
tea , which is a lot dr. who , you guys . no big deal .
you getting all packed up ?
good . we &apos;re running a little bit late , so ...
‭ - ok .
good morning .
hi .
did you bring the comics ?
yeah , the new one comes out today .
we really appreciate you giving us a drive again .
sure , absolutely . anytime .
ok , let &apos;s get you packed up .
let &apos;s grab your lunch .
right here .
alrighty .
you got everything ?
yeah .
yeah . no com--you &apos;re not gonna bring comics to school , all right ?
mpd !
i &apos;m on the job .
drop your weapon .
i &apos;m aaron hotchner with the fbi .
we know who you are . lower your gun .
who sent you ?
hotch .
this is a mistake .
daddy , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s ok , jack .
on your knees .
hands behind your back .
is this really necessary ?
now !
daddy ...
it &apos;s ok , jack . it &apos;s a big mistake
and everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
daddy ...
dad !
where &apos;s hotch being held ?
i don &apos;t know yet . i have calls out .
metro swat took him in ?
yeah , but it has to be bigger than that .
jj &apos;s on her way here right now .
she couldn &apos;t explain everything on the phone
because she &apos;s with the kids .
ok , maybe hotch was swatted .
that &apos;s an extreme prank that gamers pull on their opponents ,
where they fake a 911 call on them .
it &apos;s recently escalated among celebrities .
if it was a prank , they wouldn &apos;t have arrested him .
unless they didn &apos;t know .
if someone called 911 and said that hotch is a threat ,
swat has to respond .
which means somewhere there &apos;s a record of that call .
yeah , on it .
hey , guys !
hi , uncle spencer .
oh , hello !
how are you doing , henry ?
good . everybody &apos;s gonna hang out at mom &apos;s work today .
oh , that sounds super fun .
have you been practicing the magic trick i taught you , jack ?
can i go to my dad &apos;s office ?
yeah , of course .
here . come on , fellas ,
let &apos;s go find something to get into . come on .
come on , let &apos;s go . this way .
it &apos;s bad .
how much did they see ?
all of it .
which is why i figured this is the safest place to bring them .
just got word .
he &apos;s downtown .
we &apos;re boarding now .
hey . that &apos;s the bau unit chief .
you &apos;ve made a mistake .
dave , tell jack i &apos;m ok .
aaron , what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re set .
then let &apos;s go .
第十一季第二十二集
&quot; the sea is dangerous
and its storms terrible .
but these obstacles have never been sufficient reason to remain ashore . &quot;
ferdinand magellan .
i need to let my son know that i &apos;m all right .
he &apos;s with agent jareau .
i want my phone call .
you haven &apos;t even asked why you &apos;re here .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s either a mistake
or i &apos;m being framed .
this came in today at 7 : 23 a.m.
911 . what is your emergency ?
hello ? 911 .
is anyone there ?
today will change everything .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . will you repeat that , please ?
today will change everything .
what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know because i didn &apos;t make that call .
the call was traced to your cell phone ,
and voice recognition says it &apos;s you .
today will change everything .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . will you repeat that , please ?
today will change everything .
how did they do that ?
spoofing tech makes it seem like
it &apos;s coming from hotch &apos;s cell and using his voice .
that takes skill .
it &apos;s subtle , but his inflection changes .
it sounds like the words are spliced together .
let &apos;s look up
all bau press conferences led by hotch .
right . maybe this unsub frankensteined his voice .
he &apos;s being held by the doj ,
the inspector general &apos;s office .
that makes sense . it &apos;s the internal affairs
of the parent agency of the bureau .
they probably heard what we heard .
they should be defending him , not charging him .
whoever &apos;s doing this wants me here instead of investigating .
there has to be a bigger plan
because they want my team distracted .
do you have a storage unit in reston , virginia ?
my wife an i had one . it &apos;s been cleared out for years .
why did you rent a van last week ?
i didn &apos;t .
have you ever purchased nitromethane , diesel fuel ,
blasting caps , or ball bearings ?
no .
‭ - you sure about that ?
yes .
my door was kicked in 2.1 / 2 hours ago .
how long have you had this ?
we &apos;ve been watching you , for weeks .
with these 3 press conferences ,
we can prove to the inspector general &apos;s office
that hotch &apos;s 911 call was spliced together .
that &apos;s a good start , but they &apos;re not gonna listen to anything
we have to say until we give them a viable suspect .
especially with explosives in play .
they planted enough on hotch
to make it look like he was ready to blow up a city block .
ok , back to basics .
someone &apos;s framing hotch . who would want to ?
he &apos;s put away a lot of people .
we &apos;ve seen the lengths that
chaz montolo went to against morgan for revenge .
we shouldn &apos;t underestimate anything .
not even montolo could pull this off .
this is multi @-@ faceted , calculated for maximum disruption .
attacking hotch in his home , separating him from us .
we should focus on unsubs that are sophisticated enough
to carry of this coordinated of an attack .
how are you doing with the cell spoofing technology ?
ok , there &apos;s a few of them .
if you were gonna go down and dirty , that would be shadow cell .
there &apos;s other , higher @-@ end apps--
spoof me , the storm , gamercall--
wait . what was that middle one , the storm ?
yeah . why ?
that was antonia &apos;s message to hotch .
&quot; there &apos;s a storm coming ,
and you &apos;ll be swept away . &quot;
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but this feels like a massive storm .
it can &apos;t be a coincidence .
yeah , but there &apos;s no way
she could have pulled this off from inside prison .
but she knew about it enough to toy with hotch .
anybody want to go slap that smirk off her face ?
yeah , she &apos;s been pulling strings since we met her .
she wanted the bau &apos;s attention , but why ?
her narcissism .
we each spent time with her , a lot of it .
but she didn &apos;t mention the storm
until hotch went back to question her again .
it was a retort , after hotch exposed her past .
and her son .
you enjoying this ?
i &apos;m a creature of habit .
i prefer we do this in my cell .
if you really wanted the bau to suffer ,
you wouldn &apos;t have warned us .
you &apos;d only warn us if there was something in it for you .
oh , you really are smart .
so it got me thinking .
you &apos;re in here for life .
what could you possibly gain ?
your son was born when you were only 14 .
which would make him ... 43 now ?
your family was ashamed .
so he was raised away from you .
but you never lost touch with him .
have you always lived on the sappy side ,
or did that come out when you became a mother ?
the only reason you warned agent hotchner about this storm
is because your son had something to do with it .
and now you need our help .
not as much as you need mine .
your son framed a federal agent
and manipulated special weapons and tactics operatives to do it .
so , here &apos;s the thing about swat .
they don &apos;t like being manipulated .
so now your son is on a shoot first , ask questions later list .
i want him taken into custody , alive .
of course you do . what mother wouldn &apos;t ?
the truth is , i can &apos;t really promise you what will happen
if he gets caught .
you won &apos;t let him get killed .
i know you . you took an oath
and too goody @-@ two @-@ shoes to break it .
yeah , yesterday , yesterday i wouldn &apos;t have .
but that was before your son
had armed men point guns in the same room as my son .
so , when we find him ,
this can go one of two ways .
promise me he won &apos;t get hurt .
give me his name .
this is antonia &apos;s son .
his name &apos;s asher douglas .
he lives in northern virginia .
early 40s is old for a swatter .
but he &apos;s a match in every way that counts .
he purchased the storm spoofing software ,
he bought several audio splicing programs .
and that &apos;s how he was able to make calls
from hotch &apos;s cell and sound like him .
something about this doesn &apos;t fit .
it fits enough for me . let &apos;s go .
swatting can fall in the spectrum of online psychopathy .
men who express violent
anti @-@ social tendencies from behind a screen
that the would never express in public .
but their patterns mirror that of a traditional psychopath ,
and specifically the fact that they get bored easily .
which makes me think we &apos;d see evidence of that
in his browser history , but you didn &apos;t .
i thought he was covering his tracks .
even if you &apos;re right , it doesn &apos;t change the fact
that he made the 911 call . we have to arrest him .
hotch is depending on us .
who gave you probable cause to put me under surveillance ?
a confidential source .
tell me now or i will invoke .
you know who needs lawyers ?
guilty people .
smart people .
so lay out your entire case to me right now
or every attorney i know will drop everything and come help me .
we got a tip from a source .
and it was very convincing .
antonia slade .
no , not slade .
all right , we &apos;re recording with peter lewis ,
aka mr. scratch .
do you swear under penalty of perjury
that the testimony you are about to give is the truth ?
most certainly .
and with advice of counsel ...
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding .
you are giving this testimony of your own free will ?
yes , that is correct .
i &apos;m not doing this to cut a deal .
the world needs to know what kind of man
aaron hotchner really is .
turn around show me your hands .
whatever you &apos;re holding , drop it .
but then it will break .
drop it or i will shoot you .
i said drop it !
wait , hold ! everyone hold .
asher , if you show us what you &apos;re holding
and it isn &apos;t dangerous , we &apos;ll let you keep it .
why would it be dangerous ?
because we &apos;re with the police
and we have to be prepared for the worst .
you &apos;re not the police .
you &apos;re with the federal bureau of investigations .
you &apos;re dr. spencer reid .
you &apos;re supervisory special agent david rossi .
i researched all of you
to decide who would be the best one to swat ,
before landing on agent aaron hotchner ,
since he is the team leader , obviously .
can i see what &apos;s in your hands ?
slowly .
they &apos;re , um , my version of the a @-@ 9 chip ,
only mine are better .
can you set them down so we can talk ?
sure .
i need to put these on you , ok ?
but it &apos;s for your own protection .
ok .
there , let &apos;s go .
we should secure the house ,
but we &apos;re not gonna find anything else here .
best hope is to get him talking , but that could be tough .
why ?
well , he displays both collecting behavior
and unique dysgraphia traits in his handwriting .
i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s autistic .
it was march of last year .
i dosed agent hotchner with a dissociative drug .
what did this drug do ?
it put you in a state where you experienced a waking dream .
now , i try to get my victims to see their worst nightmares .
but agent hotchner , well ...
he went in his own direction .
what do you mean by that ?
he started rambling about how i killed his team ,
which i expected .
but then ...
he started to laugh ...
like he was delighted .
and i &apos;ll be honest with you ,
in that moment , i was scared ... of him .
of what he could do to his own team .
or his own son , for that matter .
i was scared--
why would you believe anything he says ?
we didn &apos;t .
but it got us digging , into you .
what about me ?
was your wife killed
because of your responsibilities with this job ? yes .
did you question your commitment to the bau after her murder ?
yes .
and how does that connect to this ?
because it was then that you started dismissing procedure .
i did not .
you faked agent prentiss &apos; death .
you rubber @-@ stamped the unjustified shooting , by agent rossi ,
of the man who killed jason gideon ,
giving him a pass for the same crime
you expelled agent greenaway for 10 years ago .
each of those instances was a judgment call .
and it &apos;s a waste of our time for me to justify each one .
but i can .
good . because this last one
is one you have no defense for .
he subjected you to a very powerful drug ...
one that with other victims
led to psychotic breaks .
now , why wouldn &apos;t you
include that in your bureau psychological evaluation ?
agent ?
agent ?
we &apos;re looking at a case of counterfeit deviance .
if asher is autistic ,
he has trouble reading social cues .
yeah , but in this case
we &apos;re dealing with somebody high @-@ functioning .
what used to be labeled asperger &apos;s syndrome .
and that &apos;s where the counterfeit deviance comes in .
documented examples include high @-@ functioning autistics
who collect child porn or pretend to plan a school shooting .
they know that there &apos;s power in those images and those actions ,
but for them there &apos;s no paraphilia behind it .
they don &apos;t derive pleasure from it .
what i don &apos;t see is evidence of someone
who &apos;s interested in explosives .
we need to rule out--
that someone is pulling his strings
just like he &apos;s been pulling ours .
exactly . i &apos;d like to--
go . just do it . and hurry .
i &apos;m going to jail , aren &apos;t i ?
not if you cooperate .
all right .
i did it .
all of it .
see , i don &apos;t think you did .
even the way you just said that
sort of sounds to me like
someone who &apos;s maybe protecting a partner .
would a partner have the skill set
to splice agent aaron hotchner &apos;s voice into a 911 call ?
something no gamer &apos;s ever done before ?
no . i did that . me .
how much do you know about nitromethane ?
it &apos;s the simplest organic nitro compound .
it has an r.e. factor of 1.1 .
that &apos;s its relative effectiveness compared to--
tnt ? right ?
have you ever bought it ?
no point . what would i do with it ?
well , when agent hotchner was arrested ,
they found that he had bought some .
i think it was planted on him ,
and i don &apos;t think you would do that .
i get-- this isn &apos;t self @-@ harm .
ok .
i used to do that .
i don &apos;t do it anymore . instead i do this .
to control how you feel when you get confused ?
yes .
you know , i get confused a lot , too , asher .
it &apos;s actually one of the reasons
i decided to study behavioral analysis .
and i don &apos;t think my friend
would buy 40 gallons of nitromethane .
but yours might .
40 gallons ?
does that mean something to you ?
yeah . we talked about it once .
how much of a city you could wipe out with 40 gallons .
it was a hypothetical ,
like if you had the biggest chemistry set in the world .
i don &apos;t think it was a hypothetical , asher .
he lied to me .
he did .
help me , and i &apos;ll make sure that never happens again .
the reason i didn &apos;t mention the drugging
is i knew how it would be received .
that someone at the doj would misinterpret ,
and someone else would use it to their advantage .
that &apos;s one profile .
here &apos;s another .
&quot; the most common trait is an unyielding belief
&quot; he is always right ,
&quot; often reinforced by traumatic loss .
&quot; the suspect will
&quot; purposefully separate himself from is co @-@ workers
&quot; and quietly keep score ,
&quot; cataloging every slight against him .
&quot; he will then use those slights to justify his own self @-@ interest .
&quot; one final trigger ,
&quot; like a violent confrontation
&quot; or a drug @-@ induced episode
&quot; will push him over the edge . &quot;
sound familiar ?
of course .
it &apos;s my profile on workplace shooters .
and now it fits you .
&quot; today will change everything . &quot;
what did you think , that i was going to blow up my team ?
turn my son into an orphan ?
and then-- and this is the part i argue against in the profile--
i would call 911 and tell you what i was about to do ?
i want to believe you .
but i can &apos;t .
if i can direct your attention to rossi &apos;s phone ,
i will introduce you to eric rawdon .
he has had multiple irc chats with asher
until he was arrested for criminal conspiracy .
conspiracy with who ?
well , it looks like a bunch of anarchists .
rawdon isn &apos;t necessarily an anarchist himself ,
but he did want to make something go boom .
so he &apos;s charismatic , duplicitous .
i mean , he &apos;d have to be to
persuade a bunch of anarchists to rally around him .
what &apos;s the overlap with hotch ?
our gone but
not forgotten and soon to be recovered sir hotchner
wrote up up a profile on rawdon , which he defended in court .
and this is revenge .
no , we know it &apos;s bigger than that .
but there &apos;s no way rawdon could have pulled this off while in prison .
garcia , what was the last contact
rawdon had with asher ?
uh , emails from last week .
the ip addresses are from all over the state ,
but none from virginia super max prison
where rawdon currently resides .
so someone else took over the account ,
or multiple someones , depending on who &apos;s still supporting rawdon .
i &apos;m gonna add &quot; word &quot; to the end of tara &apos;s last sentiment ,
because whoever is sending these emails
has gone hog wild over the last 12 hours ,
and the message is always the same--
&quot; the storm breaks tonight . get his bed ready . &quot;
that &apos;s reminiscent of the emails the 911 hijackers
sent to each other . weeks before the attack .
coded messages like , &quot; this summer will surely be hot . &quot;
it was their way of saying the plan is set .
except this is &quot; the storm breaks tonight . &quot;
he &apos;s planning a prison break .
d @-@ block secure .
clocking out for the night .
get back in your cell .
control , i got a faulty door on d @-@ 28 .
get back in now or i &apos;ll make you .
we &apos;ve got multiple cells open on d @-@ block .
lock down whole wing . repeat , multiple cells open !
somebody copy . the control room is empty .
we have multiple cells open .
nobody &apos;s running the show !
that &apos;s affirmative , agent rossi .
the riot just started here in va max .
focus all your efforts on finding rawdon . we need him alive .
has anyone escaped ?
we don &apos;t know . we &apos;re still trying to secure the prison .
ok , warden , we &apos;re 5 minutes out .
guys , the swatting , the reference to asher--
this is exactly the larger plan we profiled .
it worked . rawdon has another group
he &apos;s been working from the inside .
by the time we clear hotch , they &apos;ll be gone .
who &apos;s eric rawdon ?
he &apos;s behind this .
maybe he &apos;s your partner .
if that were true , you &apos;d have evidence .
i do .
the storage locker , your name , the supplies .
you &apos;re grasping .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
you need me here as cover for missing a major terrorist incident .
it &apos;s a prison break .
not to rawdon .
his dream has always been to set off a bomb
in a major metropolitan area .
not for any political or ideological reason ,
he just wants to see a city burn .
and you &apos;re letting it happen .
now you &apos;re grasping .
am i ? ask yourself one question .
am i more helpful here ,
mentally preparing a report
to the subcommittee that &apos;s gonna haul you in ,
or out there , catching rawdon ?
ssa rossi .
warden nabb .
your call came in , it &apos;s too late , agent .
have you located eric rawdon ?
not yet . the rioters still control 3 blocks ,
and the fires inside have spread us thin .
warden , this isn &apos;t a riot . it &apos;s a break .
they &apos;ll never get over the wall .
they may have some other way out .
every part of this plan has been meticulously crafted .
we got a distress call that
some of the prisoners got to the gun safe .
first priority is to secure the control room .
got one !
where are the others ?
how are they getting out ?
freeze !
you got a flashlight ?
captain , we got a tunnel .
rossi , we got a tunnel in c @-@ block
along the sewer line on the east wall .
copy , tara . we &apos;re on our way .
evening .
including rawdon ?
kershaw and bring , you stay here
in case more prisoners come back through .
we should keep moving to the control room .
we should also sweep e @-@ block . rawdon could be holed up there .
captain , i &apos;ll stay on your six .
fine by me . just watch your front sight .
captain .
go ahead .
just got a sit rep . the prisoners have the control room .
copy that .
it &apos;s gonna get hairy in there .
they &apos;re not gonna give it up without a fight .
i need you to stay here .
copy that . i &apos;ll wait for your signal .
one man down . everyone else ok ?
we &apos;re good .
it &apos;s a trap !
captain , do you copy ?
captain ?
dr. lewis ?
ennis ?
i thought that was you .
what are you doing here ?
you should know . they sent me here
right after you finished interviewing me .
i don &apos;t appreciate my words being used against me , tara .
ennis , i had nothing to do with--
then why was i transferred ?
it must have been that they read what you wrote
in the report about me and assumed that i was like ...
them .
who &apos;s &quot; them , &quot; ennis ?
the worst of the worst .
don &apos;t you know where you are ?
this is the serial killer wing .
hey . we &apos;re all clear .
take the automatic weapons , their uniforms , and vests .
we &apos;re going out the same way they came in .
one problem .
we have feds in a and e @-@ block .
we &apos;ll take care of e @-@ block ourselves .
as for a , i held back the monsters for a reason .
ennis , don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve dreamed of this , tara . dreamed of it .
i will shoot you .
i mean it .
there &apos;s only one problem .
you can &apos;t take us all .
jj , reid , backup , now !
on our way .
backup &apos;s not coming .
don &apos;t do this , ennis , please .
are you trying to beg your way out of this ?
i &apos;m trying to save your life .
look behind you .
back in your cells ! hands up !
that &apos;s reid and jj .
get ready !
flash @-@ bang !
where &apos;s the bomb ?
you &apos;ll never stop it in time .
boom .
last time you were going to assemble them
in one of 3 locations , and you &apos;re too compulsive to deviate .
arlington , but they &apos;re looking for you there .
appomattox county is too far away .
they &apos;re at the ivory tower .
what ? that &apos;s not true !
what &apos;s the ivory tower ?
a safe house for fundamentalist groups .
garcia , we got a location .
i need you to give it to all available swat resources .
let &apos;s go .
up !
come on , get this thing airborne !
&quot; the line dividing good and evil
cuts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
alexandr solzhenitsyn .
are you ok ?
mm . yeah .
is it over ?
hope so .
where are the boys ?
in the office .
what you doin &apos; ?
drawing .
can i take a look ?
no .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m ok .
how about you ?
i &apos;m fine .
hey , buddy . come here .
you ready to go ?
sure .
morning .
rough night ?
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t go .
i think i fooled myself into thinking
that things would be different .
i think you did , too .
it is different .
david , the job will always be the same .
yes .
but i &apos;m different .
do me just one favor .
before you make any decision ...
meet my team .
they &apos;re the only family i have outside of you and joy .
i walked away 30 years ago .
i &apos;m not walking away this time .
please .
stay .
on one condition .
that we call our daughter back .
together .
and there they are .
please , come in .
spence , tara , this is hayden montgomery .
vous parlez francais tres bien , madame .
she &apos;s my favorite so far .
this way .
keep your eyes on him . he &apos;s very sneaky with his cards .
there &apos;s nothing sneaky about it . it is merely magic .
i need you to blow on this card , please .
you blow .
and this is your card .
no .
that &apos;s not your card ?
wait . hold on .
ok .
this is your card .
no .
no .
are you serious ? that &apos;s not your card ?
hold on .
is that your card ?
how did you do that ? !
i had a hard time putting both boys down last night .
they couldn &apos;t sleep ?
other way around .
i didn &apos;t want to leave them .
how are things on your end ?
you know , fortunately jack doesn &apos;t remember
a lot about haley &apos;s death .
he knows the story , but he was young .
that &apos;s a good thing .
that &apos;s a very good thing .
but he &apos;s not going to forget seeing me at gunpoint .
i just don &apos;t want this job to
take anything else away from him .
well , maybe it gives him something , too .
you &apos;re his hero .
not a pretend hero , a real hero .
well , he &apos;s growing up . he &apos;s not going to feel that way
for too much longer .
nah , you can worry about that later .
just be his dad .
enjoy that .
wait . wait , don &apos;t move .
what ? what ?
oh , no .
oh , my god , you have something in your hair !
holy guacamole !
i &apos;ll be right back .
what is it now ?
3 more prison breaks in 3 different states ,
all organized by rawdon &apos;s partners
from his last bombing attempt .
the local field office got a head start
because of what we did .
they stopped the bomb threat , but --
who didn &apos;t they catch ?
all have serial killer wings just like va max .
let me guess . they were released first
to cause maximum chaos and occupy law enforcement .
a lot of them were killed or recaptured , but not all of them .
how many got away ?
as of right now , 13 serial killers ,
one of which is peter lewis .
mr. scratch .
that &apos;s why he testified against you .
he was part of their plan all along .
so we have to catch him again ,
along with 12 other murderers .
