so sheldon , there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been wanting to talk about
but i know it &apos;s kind of a touchy subject .
way to narrow it down to everything .
what is it ?
well , your birthday &apos;s coming up .
and you &apos;ve never let us celebrate it .
and i was hoping maybe this year we could .
oh , i suppose that &apos;s a discussion we could have .
okay , great , i mean ,
it doesn &apos;t have to be a big party or anything .
i was just ...
where &apos;d he go ?
w @-@ wait a minute .
you mention his birthday and he vanishes ?
well , where &apos;s that information been this whole time ?
well , where is he ?
sheldon ?
i &apos;ll check his room .
surprise !
oh , my god !
just one example
of how birthdays can be terrible .
now , can we please drop this subject
and pick a new one ?
yeah , i suggest how thick can a soup get
before it becomes a stew ?
you know , the answer , it may surprise you .
i &apos;m sorry i brought it up .
yeah , what is the problem ?
is it about getting older ?
please , look at this porcelain skin .
i &apos;m like a human sink .
but it &apos;s the one day a year that &apos;s just all about you .
one day .
ha ha .
right .
can you please just tell me why ?
fine .
as you know , i have a twin sister
with whom i obviously share a birthday .
every year we &apos;d have a party .
no one i invited would ever come ,
because they didn &apos;t like me .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , that part wasn &apos;t so bad .
i didn &apos;t like them , either .
but then i &apos;d inevitably spend the whole day
being tortured by my sister &apos;s friends .
oh , you poor thing .
when i was six , they told me batman was coming to my party .
i waited by the door for hours .
closest thing to batman i saw
was when a robin flew into the window .
you realize none of those things would happen now ?
i do , but why do you care
if i celebrate my birthday at all ?
well , you made my last birthday so memorable ,
i wanted to return the favor .
yeah , if you had a party now ,
you have plenty of friends that would love to come .
and we live here , so we have no choice .
yeah .
very well .
you may celebrate my life by throwing a party
with cake , presents and a shower of admiration and love .
but then you owe me big @-@ time .
you have any idea what you &apos;re getting
sheldon for his birthday ?
he &apos;s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately .
maybe we could get him a fossil .
well , just don &apos;t get anything jurassic .
he feels like that whole chunk of time has gone hollywood .
hey , uh , you know ,
he told a sad story about how his sister
tricked him into thinking batman was coming to his party .
that &apos;s funny .
let &apos;s do that .
maybe we could get batman to actually show up .
you mean , some guy in a lame suit ?
or a real batman . hey , stuart ?
didn &apos;t you try to get adam west to do a signing here once ?
yeah , but there was kind of a scheduling conflict .
he , uh , wanted to know when he &apos;d get paid .
and i wouldn &apos;t tell him .
can i get his contact info ?
sure , uh , but just so you know ,
he &apos;s kind of a diva .
he is ?
oh , yeah .
won &apos;t take the bus .
he won &apos;t pack his own lunch .
won &apos;t let you spend the night on his couch .
okay , so how do you feel about party balloons ?
uh , mylar balloons , yes .
latex balloons , no .
water balloons , i will jump off the roof
and aim for your car .
all right , what about music ?
i enjoy marching bands
and tibetan throat singing .
no music it is .
what kind of cake do you like ?
well , my favorite is chocolate with strawberry frosting ,
three layers , and if there &apos;s writing on it ,
make sure it &apos;s not all caps .
i don &apos;t need my dessert yelling at me .
hey , so what was adam west like on the phone ?
uh , nice guy .
but it was a little weird to hear batman say ,
&quot; don &apos;t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy . &quot;
you know , adam west is my favorite batman ?
well , after michael keaton ,
christian bale
2008年 《 蝙蝠侠 : 黑暗骑士 》 2012年 《 黑暗骑士崛起 》
and batman from the lego movie .
don &apos;t say that to him .
what ? he beat out george clooney .
and that &apos;s something .
like , i love me some clooney .
don &apos;t say that to anyone .
thank you so much for helping us , stuart .
oh , i @-@ i was just glad to be invited .
to be honest , i don &apos;t always feel like i &apos;m part of the group .
okay , sweetie , we &apos;re on the clock here .
can you hate yourself and frost at the same time ?
hello , i hope i &apos;m not too early .
no , no , no . come on in .
and how is the radiant mommy @-@ to @-@ be ?
doing great .
y @-@ you &apos;re pregnant ?
yeah .
sounds like something a member of the group might know .
yeah , birthday party first .
pity party later .
are you crazy ?
how can you put michael keaton
in front of christian bale ?
oh , please .
even my poodles know bale &apos;s overrated .
thank you !
that &apos;s why i say keaton &apos;s number one .
he brought a sense of humor to the role .
oh , if you &apos;re gonna factor in a sense of humor ,
then i should be at the top of the list .
it should be me ,
keaton , kilmer ,
lego , bale ,
and that pretty boy clooney .
really ? you &apos;re ahead of bale ?
the man who personified the words ,
i &apos;m batman .
i never had to say i &apos;m batman .
i showed up .
people knew i was batman .
everywhere i went-- on the tv show ,
mall openings ...
julie newmar &apos;s bungalow .
i &apos;m sold-- you &apos;re ahead of bale .
there &apos;s another reason i should be higher on the list .
all those other guys
had muscles built into their costumes .
all i had in my batsuit
was 100 % , grade @-@ a west .
can we just all agree we &apos;re worried about affleck ?
sure .
yeah , of course .
what &apos;s an affleck ?
is there a reason i had to leave my own apartment ?
well , i think they just want you to see it
for the first time all decorated .
but who &apos;s gonna tell them they &apos;re doing it wrong ?
well , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll ask you to give a speech ,
and that &apos;s when you just tear &apos; em a new one .
have to say , you ...
you do look good in that suit .
oh . thank you .
maybe later i &apos;ll , uh ...
get to see you in your birthday suit .
but this is my birthday suit .
are you having a stroke ?
because that &apos;s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party .
so , mother , i &apos;m surprised you came all this way
for sheldon &apos;s birthday .
oh , i was happy to .
he did come to my 60th .
oh . you had a party for your 60th ?
oh , i wouldn &apos;t call it a party .
just a few close friends .
and your sister and brother .
you know , to be fair , we did get married in vegas
and didn &apos;t invite her .
and i never did thank you for that , dear .
penny says everyone &apos;s there . are you ready ?
i am .
wait . are you all right ?
no , i just ... i got a little light @-@ headed .
oh , d @-@ do you need a minute ?
no .
no , if i can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window ,
i suppose i can do this .
happy birthday !
speech ! speech !
come on , sheldon , say something .
uh , thank you all so much for coming .
uh , beverly .
wil wheaton .
adam west , for some reason .
batman finally came to your party .
happy birthday , sherman .
thank you .
this is all so thoughtful .
excuse me .
i still get paid , don &apos;t i ?
okay , i &apos;d better go in there and talk to him .
well , don &apos;t you think i &apos;m the one who should go in ?
no offense , but i &apos;ve known the guy a really long time .
well , i &apos;ve , you know ,
seen him without pants on .
again , no offense , but so have i.
well , he &apos;s seen me without pants on .
again , no ...
okay , this is ridiculous .
sheldon ?
can i come in ?
how do you know i &apos;m not using the facilities ?
because you e @-@ mail me your bathroom schedule once a week ,
even though i &apos;ve clicked unsubscribe ,
like , a thousand times .
so ...
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i looked around the room ,
and i saw all the faces and the presents ,
and it ... it was just too much .
i get that .
hey , you want to just bring a few people in here ?
you know , wil wheaton in the bathtub ,
batman on the toilet .
it &apos;ll be like the weirdest comic @-@ con ever .
i know that you worked hard to put this together .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m ruining it .
oh , pl ... you &apos;re not ruining it .
look , at some point , raj will try to get everyone
to do the electric slide .
now , that will ruin it .
i don &apos;t think i can go back out there .
that &apos;s fine .
you know , i hate that your sister and her friends
used to torture you .
but what i hate even more is , if i was there ,
i would have tortured you , too .
based on this pep talk , i &apos;d say you &apos;re still doing it .
my point is ,
there was a time i never would &apos;ve been friends
with someone like you , and now ...
you are one of my favorite people .
so , if what you need is
to spend your birthday in a bathroom ,
i &apos;m happy to do it with you .
well , everyone will think i &apos;m weird .
sweetie , you are weird .
everyone knows you &apos;re weird ,
but they &apos;re all still here
because they care about you so much .
hello .
some of us need to check our hair
because we might have a shot with leonard &apos;s mother .
leonard .
it &apos;s been a while .
leslie .
i can &apos;t remember the last time we talked .
so much has changed .
has it ?
yeah , uh , um , penny and i got married .
wow , congratulations .
you know , actually ,
i thought you &apos;d be living with sheldon forever .
yeah , well ...
don &apos;t be a stranger .
okay , everybody ,
sheldon is gonna come back out ,
but i think he &apos;s a little embarrassed ,
so let &apos;s all be extra nice , okay ?
what are you looking at me for ?
i &apos;m a saint .
but a sinner in the sack .
hello , everyone .
i @-@ i ...
i &apos;d like to apologize for my behavior .
i hope it hasn &apos;t put a damper on the party .
so , just , please , enjoy yourselves .
oh , this is quickly getting out of hand .
if i may ,
i @-@ i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
um , thank you all for coming tonight .
i know it &apos;s customary for the birthday boy
to receive presents ,
but i feel like i got the greatest gift
the day he was born .
hear , hear .
cheers .
amy , that was lovely .
you know , this is fun .
let &apos;s do more .
someone else say something wonderful about me .
sheldon , i don &apos;t think everyone ...
wolowitz , perfect . everyone listen to wolowitz .
okay , then , uh ,
sheldon , we &apos;ve known each other a long time .
and it is a pleasure to work with you
and call you my friend .
little generic . keep thinking . we &apos;ll circle back .
wil wheaton , go .
sheldon , i know that we &apos;ve had our ups and downs ,
but i can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting
because you are in it .
we may have met because you are a fan of star trek .
but i have become a fan of sheldon cooper .
live long and prosper , buddy .
and happy birthday .
cheers .
that &apos;s how you do it , wolowitz .
now you see why he &apos;s famous and you &apos;re not .
sheldon ,
i know the future holds great things for you ,
and we all can &apos;t wait to see what they are .
happy birthday , dear .
cheers .
someone call animal control .
there &apos;s a cougar on the loose .
barry , stop .
seriously , barry , stop .
and it was gandhi who said ,
live as if you were to
die tomorrow .
learn as if you were to live forever .
and it was sheldon cooper who said let &apos;s speed this up .
a lot of people want to talk ?
uh , in the past , i would &apos;ve said something obnoxious ,
like , happy birthday , dumbass ?
but i &apos;m not gonna do it .
you and i have both grown a lot ,
and it &apos;s just so nice to see you all again .
so
happy birthday , sheldon .
oh , now , you know i hate change . say it .
happy birthday , dumbass !
happy birthday , young man .
and if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today ,
i &apos;m also available for comic @-@ cons ,
bachelor parties , bar mitzvahs ...
i can &apos;t think of anything to say that hasn &apos;t already been said .
so , here &apos;s to you , sheldon .
hear , hear . hear , hear .
thank you , bernadette .
that was perfect .
what ? you gotta be kidding me ?
sheldon , we &apos;ve been together so long ,
it &apos;s hard to remember a time you weren &apos;t in my life .
and believe me , i try .
you make me laugh .
you make me a better scientist .
you make me crazy .
you &apos;re more than just my roommate ,
you &apos;re my brother .
thank you .
happy birthday , buddy .
cheers .
thank you . that @-@ that was wonderful .
oh , wait , wait , wait .
stuart didn &apos;t get to speak .
oh , oh , okay . um ...
uh , sheldon ,
i &apos;ve spent most of my life feeling invisible ,
but having you and everyone ...
hey , everybody , listen up .
you nailed it .
we &apos;ve got someone who couldn &apos;t be here
but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday .
hello , sheldon .
professor hawking .
happy birthday to you .
thank you so much .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re ...
happy birthday to you .
oh , you &apos;re singing . well , i &apos;m sorry .
happy birthday , dear sheldon .
uh , professor hawking ,
if you just give us one second , we &apos;ll light the candles ,
and we can all sing together .
i was crushing it , but all right .
okay , while they get the cake ,
sheldon , i just want to say ,
i hope you didn &apos;t think you were gonna get through tonight
without a hug .
you know , i used to hate these hugs .
now they &apos;re just extremely irritating .
ready when you are , professor hawking .
and a one , and a two ...
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday , dear sheldon
happy birthday to you .
... to you .
so , who &apos;s taking me home ?
