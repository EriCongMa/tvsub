gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i need your passion for social upheaval
to help me write the book about the upper east side .
don &apos;t just stand there . start typing .
real names this time . no holding back .
everyone gets exposed .
i have decided to retire ,
that &apos;s why i want you to take over my company .
i didn &apos;t realize how much i missed it ,
but now that i &apos;m back and i &apos;m with you ,
new york has never seemed more perfect .
i think it &apos;s really brave ,
you deciding to run &quot; the spectator &quot; on your own .
no investors , no partners .
wait , are you here to freak me out
or write a paper on--on my paper ?
your father gave it to me to keep quiet .
for that amount of money , you must know a hell of a secret .
i swear i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but i &apos;m willing to stick around to find out .
sorry for dropping in after hours ,
but i was walking by
and i saw that your office light was on .
would you like to have a drink with me ?
up and at &apos; em , , upper east siders .
it &apos;s important to start your day right .
seems like you were already up .
yeah .
thanks to you , i &apos;ve been up all week .
five more minutes .
we might need a little longer .
there &apos;s nothing worse
than waking up on the wrong side of the bed ...
i thought we agreed you &apos;d stop watching me sleep .
i lied . i &apos;m letting you stay here for free .
there has to be something in it for me .
except maybe waking up alone .
dorota !
why did you let me sleep ? !
it &apos;s &quot; w.w.d. &quot; day !
we have to take the fashion world by storm .
first , it &apos;s breakfast ,
then shower ,
then to the atelier .
i can hardly wait to see what today brings .
i &apos;m booked on the 7 : 00 flight to dubai .
please , just a little more time .
we &apos;ve spent all week pouring over the notes
of every meeting i interpreted for bart.
there &apos;s nothing , chuck .
look , i know the reason my father faked his death
has something to do with this hotel deal .
it has to be here .
we looked . it &apos;s not .
then why would he lie about being in dubai ?
why would all the negotiations happen completely off the books ?
why would he pay you $ 10 million
not to ask any of these questions ?
if he &apos;s hiding something , i don &apos;t know what .
i &apos;m sorry . i need to get home to my fiance .
there &apos;s nothing more i can do .
you could come to brunch .
with bart ? that sounds dangerous .
you won &apos;t have to say a word .
just smile while i drop a few names to see how he reacts .
then you can take your money and go .
you know , i was a very punctual person before i met you .
well , any way i can convince you to be fashionably late
to my gala tonight ?
i know you have the crowdrise event ,
but maybe after ?
nah , i &apos;d love to , but this thing &apos;s been booked for months ,
and who knows how long it &apos;ll go ?
i don &apos;t want to say &quot; maybe &quot; and then disappoint you .
how could you disappoint me when you did so much work
to get me on the board in the first place ?
i know what a big deal the central park conservancy is .
when my mom was finally asked to host ,
she made it seem like
it was more important than being the mayor .
well , now that you &apos;re hosting , it definitely is .
tonight marks the start of a whole new era .
serena takes manhattan .
ohh . an adult manhattan .
i couldn &apos;t be happier to leave my old life behind .
well , just don &apos;t leave me ,
even if i can &apos;t make it tonight .
the renovation is complete .
fabric is all from swatches you choose .
your mother &apos;s vintage designs on display .
and this area can be showroom or waiting room ,
parties or meetings .
总结设计原则时的名言
form follows function .
and in here ...
miss blair &apos;s private office .
this ... is ... divine .
this is ...
so me .
this &quot; women &apos;s wear daily &quot; article could make or break me
as the new head of waldorf .
and the atelier is the perfect backdrop .
all these years of folding my sweaters
and fluffing my pillows has really paid off .
you &apos;ve developed taste !
yes .
oh . miss blair &apos;s new samples looks lovely .
and i glad office is up to snuff .
but i @-@ i worry if &quot; w.w.d. &quot; will ask ,
&quot; where are the designers , seamstresses , and models ? &quot;
it is unfortunate that my mother &apos;s paris team
declined to follow me back to new york , but ...
not to worry .
while you were paint and papering ,
i came up with a plan .
hello , ladies !
get ready to assume your roles .
go get dressed for success .
your sofa might be chic ,
but my neck is not happy with this kink .
would you prefer the kink
of watching your father do it with fake charlie again ?
no , i did not watch . i got the hell out before they saw me .
the image is still burnt right here .
to think that i used to consider brooklyn
a moral high ground .
now that my father &apos;s fallen off his pedestal ,
i &apos;m free of such delusions .
your loss of faith in humanity turns me on ,
as does the fact that your book was rejected
by simon &amp; shuster and you were dropped by your agent .
i still don &apos;t get why they didn &apos;t want it .
they sent me to italy to write &quot; inside part two , &quot;
and this time i delivered a real story with real names .
raw , hard facts .
please say &quot; raw &quot; and &quot; hard &quot; again .
who cares about alessandra and the entire lit set ?
they &apos;re just book nerds .
revenge is a dish best served serialized ,
one delicious chapter at a time .
once we find the right magazine , and everyone starts talking ,
then the book offers will come in .
then the movie , and then the broadway musical .
check your calendar . we have meetings all afternoon .
yeah , well , i got an errand to run .
i &apos;ll see ya at &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
can &apos;t wait to start burning bridges together .
well , thank you for accepting
our invitation for brunch , charles .
you know how important it is to me
that we make an effort as a family .
of course . and i do want you both to get to know amira .
did i mention she speaks seven languages , including body ?
numerous times . micro @-@ expressions , vocal shifts .
we get it . she &apos;s &quot; the mentalist &quot;
eat a crepe .
so how did you two get together ?
it &apos;s a tale as old as time .
boy meets girl ,
girl falls for boy and shares her deepest and darkest secrets .
chuck exaggerates .
we both found ourselves admiring the fishtank at ossiano .
a classic meet @-@ cute and quite ordinary , i &apos;m afraid .
amira was attending a business dinner with khalid al @-@ saleh .
you must know him , father .
he &apos;s big in middle east real estate .
he &apos;s developed a few hotels .
doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
really ? because amira says he knew you .
i doubt very much that amira discusses her work with you .
she seems like an intelligent woman
who understands that her livelihood ,
if not her life itself , depends on her discretion .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i should confirm my flight for tonight .
you certainly scared her off .
yeah , i think i &apos;m done also .
i have a meeting with bruce kaplan
to find out if bass industries
is finally bouncing back after your reign .
charles , i know you &apos;re upset
that your father took his company back ,
but give him a chance .
he did risk his life to save yours .
and he &apos;s not the man he used to be .
in 7 o &apos;clock .
that &apos;s right . perfect .
thank you .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i paid you a lot of money to leave the country .
i &apos;m sorry . chuck insisted that i come here today .
well , i insist you go .
our weekend together has cost me enough .
don &apos;t make me warn you again .
chuck , i think it &apos;s time to go .
what am i supposed to be ?
i &apos;m torn between nurse and cafeteria worker .
you are a seamstress ,
whom i will publicly shame with my artistic temperament .
and , kati , you are a crazed fan ,
begging to borrow a limited edition .
dorota !
when the reporter arrives ,
you will wheel out the dresses with a grand flourish .
reaction to clothes is what really counts .
if article is negative ,
could poison perception of whole line
and jeopardize future of waldorf designs .
kati , start your adulation right now .
o.m.g. nelly yuki .
great ! maybe she knows how to sew .
she lost her status as a minion
when she stole my spot at yale .
she knows better than to beg for reinstatement .
hi , blair .
&quot; hi &quot; ?
no &quot; hi . &quot; go !
before the &quot; women &apos;s wear daily &quot; reporter shows up
and thinks that i consort with fake dior @-@ carrying wannabes .
actually , this bag was a personal gift from raph
after i wrote an article on him .
after you ...
uh @-@ huh . that &apos;s right , blair .
i &apos;m the &quot; women &apos;s wear daily &quot; reporter .
thanks for picking up my check in person .
it means a lot for &quot; the spectator &quot; to sponsor
the same event as &quot; the times &quot; &quot;
well , i &apos;m glad you wanna be involved .
just do me a favor and please don &apos;t invite blair .
have you even told her that you &apos;re back yet ?
this is a long time for you to be mad at blair
just for being blair .
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m maturing .
we &apos;re just naturally growing apart .
you know , being with steven
has really helped me to understand who i wanna be .
i hope you find someone like that , too .
you never know . i might have .
what ? ! wait . who ? !
i met a girl . her name &apos;s sage .
she &apos;s a columbia journalism student .
she &apos;s funny . she &apos;s smart . i just ...
but it &apos;s all very new , so i @-@ i can &apos;t talk about it .
whoa ! shy smile , reluctant eye contact ?
i think i &apos;ve seen enough . you really like her .
keep the change . you &apos;re gonna love this place .
what , you can &apos;t even look at me ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m not not looking at you .
i &apos;m looking at her ... with your boyfriend .
it really is so good to see you .
you said that already .
twice .
blair , please .
please let me wear one of your exclusive designs .
you &apos;re supposed to be the seamstress .
go help dorota make tea , both of you .
welcome back , nelly !
i see nothing &apos;s changed around here since high school .
except you .
you look so presentable .
yes . once i got into yale ,
i realized i didn &apos;t have to dress like you anymore .
so let &apos;s see your line .
it &apos;s not here .
shipping snafu en route from paris .
you &apos;re lying .
if i were , it would only be
to protect waldorf designs from your biased opinion of me ,
which is based on nothing but good , clean high school fun .
i still have night terrors about nairtinis and yogurt bombs .
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night
shouting , &quot; tights are not pants ! &quot;
but i am not biased . i play fair .
that &apos;s why i got into yale , and you didn &apos;t .
oh . did i mention i graduated early ?
send another reporter .
it &apos;s my story . and look on the bright side .
no matter what i write ,
readers can see the pictures of your collection
next to poppy lifton &apos;s and decide for themselves .
poppy ? that ponzi @-@ scheming fauxcialite ?
the only designing she is doing is with popsicle sticks
in the arts and crafts room of a women &apos;s prison .
she &apos;s a thief .
blair , that was so four years ago .
my article is called &quot; society goes sartorial , &quot;
and it profiles two designers , you and her .
we &apos;re not photographing anything until tomorrow ,
so you have until then to decide if you wanna be included .
stop eavesdropping and get in here !
i need recon on poppy lifton &apos;s collection now .
hey , it &apos;s me . leave a message .
hey , sage , it &apos;s nate .
listen , i &apos;ve had a lot of fun this week .
buy you know what ? i &apos;m done . have a nice life .
why did you just do that ?
it &apos;s too crazy of a coincidence
that your sage and my steven are seeing each other .
well , we could have completely the wrong idea .
i doubt it . i &apos;ve had way too many girls
talk me back into relationships i wanted out of .
just like you run away
from too many guys you didn &apos;t want to confront with the truth .
i mean , maybe it &apos;s time
we start doing things a little bit differently .
you &apos;re right . we &apos;ve just made terrible relationship choices .
or as patti stanger would say , our pickers are broken .
are you really quoting the millionaire matchmaker ?
as if you don &apos;t watch it .
ah . it &apos;s true .
if i really wanna be mature ,
i should just calmly ask steven to explain ...
on the phone .
good luck with that .
all right , i &apos;ve gotta get back to the office .
but , uh , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
sorry . i &apos;ll have to call you back .
did you have an affair with amira ?
i ...
spent a weekend with her .
years ago ,
after i suspected you had been with rufus .
but i apologize . that &apos;s no excuse .
no . however , it explains why she &apos;s extorting money from you .
you overheard us talking .
it seemed a small price to ensure that my old behavior
didn &apos;t get in the way of our new relationship .
well , thank you . i appreciate your honesty .
um , i can &apos;t imagine how charles will feel
when he finds out about his girlfriend &apos;s agenda .
i suspect that &apos;s why he &apos;s brought her here .
one second .
serena . hi .
hi .
i didn &apos;t expect to hear from you today .
how is the party planning ?
uh , good , i think .
is everything okay ?
uh , are you seeing someone else ?
um , it &apos;s--it &apos;s okay if you are ,
because , you know , we never really defined things
over the summer .
well , we didn &apos;t have to define things .
we moved in together .
i know , but , you know , that was in the country .
and , you know , maybe you have something going on here
that &apos;s a little complicated .
i mean , i would understand if you do ,
but--but just please tell me the truth .
i &apos;m not seeing anyone else .
but i have to get back to my meeting , so i &apos;ll call you later .
nate . thanks for calling , man .
serena &apos;s intervention wasn &apos;t exactly conducive to catching up .
true , but i know what you were up to this summer .
well , are you referring to my acquired taste for a tuscan red
or--or georgina cracking the whip ?
you didn &apos;t really let her , did you ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no . it was a figure of speech .
no , i meant she was being a slave driver about my new book .
that &apos;s actually what i wanna talk to you about .
i wanna publish it in &quot; the spectator . &quot;
you--do you know what it &apos;s about ?
serialized character studies of people on the upper east side .
yeah , using real names .
i get it , all right , but i really need it
after i gave up my &quot; who is gossip girl ? &quot; expose .
mixing business and friendship didn &apos;t work so well
with the film rights to &quot; inside . &quot;
all right , first of all , that was serena . this is me .
second , &quot; the spectator &quot; has an entire print arm now .
i can publish it on multiple platforms .
this could be a defining moment for us .
look , nate , i &apos;m flattered ,
but i &apos;m letting georgina handle the business side .
so if you-- if you really want in ,
you &apos;re gonna have to call her .
all right .
why do you look like
the &quot; before &quot; pictures of people who need botox ?
you can &apos;t be worried
that poppy &apos;s collection is better than mine .
actually , it &apos;s pretty much the same .
w @-@ what do you mean &quot; the same &quot; ?
like , the same ... quality ?
the same style ?
the same , blair .
she &apos;s using that exact ... fabric .
nelly ! she set me up !
if i &apos;m in her article ,
she will write that i copied poppy .
but then if i &apos;m not ,
she will showcase poppy &apos;s collection alone ,
and then everyone will assume that i am the plagiarist !
you &apos;re screwed ! sorry .
nelly got into yale by playing clean ,
but no one does dirty better than blair waldorf .
those dresses will never be photographed .
hello , lily .
charles , your father told me
what you did this morning ,
and i &apos;m not pleased about it .
are you referring to the fact i didn &apos;t finish my eggs
or that i forgot to say good @-@ bye when i left ?
you brought amira to our home to extort money from bart
and to wreak havoc on our relationship .
i don &apos;t know what my father &apos;s told you ,
but let me assure you ,
amira &apos;s presence has nothing to do with you .
well , since they slept together ,
it has everything to do with me .
i &apos;m sorry , lily . i had no idea .
i have to go .
wait .
when were you planning to tell me
you had an affair with my father ?
poor chuck .
everyone knows the first place to check for secrets
is under the bed .
or in it .
it &apos;s terrific , exactly what &quot; the nation &quot; likes--
literate but a little licentious .
it will rock the upper east side
and make waves way beyond new york .
genius . it &apos;ll be like when people first read dominick .
i told you . he &apos;s the second coming .
and third and fourth if he lets you stay the night .
of course , we &apos;ll have to fact @-@ check it .
that could take a while .
ben &apos;s really good friends with the basses ,
so there would have to be some cuts ,
and i &apos;m not talking about their time in tennis camp .
but we just can &apos;t open ourselves to a biro @-@ sized libel suit .
maybe lose the last names ?
what is the point of publishing an expose
if you &apos;re not going to expose everything ?
who cares ?
they &apos;re willing to pay for the version that works for them .
it &apos;ll get us both out of brooklyn .
no , but then i &apos;m compromising my integrity again .
what happened to telling the truth about these people ?
save your passion for your poetry ,
which you can write as much as you want
once this makes you rich and famous .
well , i @-@ i did the soft pedal with &quot; inside , &quot;
and my life stayed remarkably the same .
why is the handsome , vacant one calling me ?
if you &apos;re referring to nate , he has a surprisingly high i.q.
but he--he wants the book for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
okay , no .
we &apos;re playing with the big boys on this one .
so stop moping and go find yourself a suit
you can wear to a bidding war .
you sneak up the fire escape here
and smash poppy &apos;s showroom window .
why can &apos;t kati &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend who showed us poppy &apos;s samples
just let us in ?
so it looks like a random robbery ,
not a socialite stealing samples .
wear those .
that &apos;s my ex . we have a problem .
he told you he &apos;s gay ,
just like everyone else you slept with .
discuss it with your therapist .
no , blair .
he says poppy has decided
to have &quot; w.w.d. &quot; photograph her collection
at the central park conservancy gala .
damn it ! that is the perfect backdrop !
not to mention , the clothes will be seen by all the right women .
we need to get there first and intercept .
that might be harder than you think .
why ? i can get an invitation to anything .
serena &apos;s the hostess .
serena &apos;s back ?
i didn &apos;t ... know .
i mean ... of course i knew .
it &apos;s just , the central park conservancy is ...
it &apos;s the big leagues , yeah .
well , serena &apos;s new boyfriend ...
got her on the board .
good for serena .
just so happens that i know someone else who can help us .
bart and i were only together for one weekend .
i didn &apos;t mention it because you were investigating
his business , not his personal life .
i was looking for his secrets . you count .
but then perhaps he simply paid
to hide our affair from your stepmother .
my father would never spend that kind of money on a relationship .
there must be something else connected to that weekend .
i can &apos;t imagine what ,
and i can &apos;t risk staying to find out .
then you leave without your money .
chuck , don &apos;t do this .
that money belongs to me and my family .
and it &apos;s in my safe , and i won &apos;t open it
until you tell me everything that happened that weekend .
it &apos;s nothing .
use your memory .
use your e @-@ mails . use your credit card bills .
i wanna know every person you saw , every place you went .
the sooner you write it all down , the sooner you can leave .
now i have to go and help a friend ,
but i will be back .
serena .
you must be excited about your big night .
where &apos;s steven ? i &apos;m dying to meet him .
oh , well , he &apos;s not coming ,
which is good , since i just found out he &apos;s cheating on me .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , darling .
it &apos;s steven .
he just canceled his meeting so that he can come tonight .
how--how am i supposed to face him ?
with a smile .
tonight is your entree into adult society .
you can &apos;t let him jeopardize that .
so i &apos;m just supposed to stand there and act like
i don &apos;t know he was with someone else ?
well , that &apos;s the difference
between being a grownup and in high school .
now you &apos;d better go get dressed .
it &apos;s bad form for a hostess to be late to her own gala .
i just hope there are no more surprises .
hello .
finally . i &apos;ve been trying you all afternoon .
i know .
i didn &apos;t answer . i thought the message was pretty clear .
wow , i didn &apos;t have you figured
for the voice mail breakup douche .
what changed since i left your bed this morning ?
uh , i found out you lied .
i didn &apos;t lie exactly .
you know what ? i &apos;m coming over right now to explain .
no way . i &apos;ve been manipulated by that sentence before .
listen , i &apos;m busy at &quot; the spectator &quot; &quot;
and i &apos;m already late for the conservancy gala .
forget the jeans . i need a dress for tonight .
looks like someone &apos;s getting dressed to kill--
or at least for a hell of a fight .
hi . good to see you .
ah ! oskar , hello !
how are you ?
good , thanks . do you want to take a picture ?
sure .
i loved your production of &quot; as you like it . &quot;
well , thank you . thank you .
hope to see you down at the public soon .
me , too . take care .
you look beautiful .
oh . you made it .
i know how much it meant to you .
yeah . it did .
georgina , what are we doing here ? we weren &apos;t even invited .
did not having a formal invite
ever stop norman mailer from showing up ?
the most powerful publishers in the world
are opening their pockets for philanthropy .
we just have to take advantage .
yeah , except they don &apos;t want my material
unless i cut and paste and make everyone look pretty .
once i get you your first big deal ,
then you can go all hunter s. thompson on me .
stop whining and start working the room .
i have to go find graydon and tell him he has competition
for my protege &apos;s expose .
you two are adorable .
the tisches have some new competition
for the cutest charitable couple .
nah , this one &apos;s all serena .
we &apos;d love you to introduce her as our newest board member .
then serena can present the check to the park .
sounds great .
hey , i wanted to ask you , are you still seeing ...
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i need to speak with nate . thanks .
what are you doing ?
that was the head of media for johnson &amp; johnson .
i thought you broke up with sage .
yeah , i did ,
which is more than you can say about steven .
how can you make out with a guy knowing he cheated on you ?
okay . i let him kiss me on the cheek ,
but i &apos;m not gonna break up with him or cause a scene
until after this party &apos;s over ,
which became a lot more complicated when sage arrived .
what don &apos;t girls understand about
&quot; it was fun . i &apos;m done &quot; ?
please just get rid of her .
please tell me there &apos;s a carriage somewhere
trotting away with poppy &apos;s posse .
they &apos;re on their way to the duck pond
for their photo shoot .
even though it &apos;s not really there . models are so dumb .
you should &apos;ve seen them crowded in that carriage
like four scrawny sardines .
who needs serena van der woodsen
when you are friends with andre the hansom the cab driver ?
wait . four ?
&quot; women &apos;s wear daily &quot; needed to photograph six dresses .
that means two are still on the loose .
oops .
it only takes one photograph to eclipse my line forever .
i will go distract nelly yuki .
you search and destroy anyone with a dandelion motif .
hurry ! shoo ! back to the party !
blair , are you okay ?
well , not yet . i still have two dresses i need to round up .
i didn &apos;t know that you were coming to serena &apos;s party .
i wasn &apos;t intending to , but then i heard from you .
from me ?
well , you must &apos;ve telepathically sensed
my distress for my dresses .
no , this was a text .
wait . if you didn &apos;t send it , i think i know who did .
i have to go .
hurry .
the sooner you go , the sooner you can come back .
in the grander sense .
you just gonna ignore me ?
look , i told you i have nothing to say to you except good @-@ bye .
i swear i didn &apos;t lie . i just omitted certain details .
and only because i liked you
and i knew it wouldn &apos;t change anything between us .
then i guess you &apos;re more liberal than i am
because it definitely changes things for me .
but it doesn &apos;t have to . you could pretend you don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t think i can do that .
you could at least try .
i had higher hopes for you , humphrey .
sorry . what ?
how can the smartest boy at st. jude &apos;s
still want everything he can &apos;t have ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t want her . i was just , uh ...
i was just observing .
you know , that &apos;s what writers do .
i didn &apos;t mean blair .
i mean in . your whole gatsby @-@ ish obsession .
fitzgerald seemed to make a good career out of it .
if you wanna die a miserable drunk
trying to impress people who don &apos;t know you exist .
there is that fatal flaw .
i got over mine when i went to yale
and met a bunch of other smart losers .
nelly , you &apos;re not a loser .
yes , i am , and so are you .
they &apos;ll never let us in .
the sooner you accept it ,
the sooner you can stop trying and start competing .
that &apos;s kind of tough when they already have everything .
we have the truth .
that &apos;s how the losers win .
we stop playing by their rules and make our own .
nelly , don &apos;t you look ethereal
in this garden of earthly delights .
that &apos;s my cue . it was nice talking to you , nelly .
dan , there you are . graydon wants to make us an offer .
we &apos;re going to cipriani &apos;s to discuss .
this better be good .
i just want to apologize .
we got off on the wrong foot this morning .
i wanna hear every detail of your life since constance .
amira ?
i &apos;m afraid you missed her .
i &apos;d say you could call ,
but she &apos;s probably enjoying a fine merlot
at 30,000 feet above the ground by now .
no . she wouldn &apos;t leave without her ...
money .
it &apos;s sweet , really ,
that you also use your mother &apos;s birthday as your combination .
you make it all so easy .
drink ?
blair , what are you doing here ?
well , i would &apos;ve r.s.v.p. &apos; d ...
if i got my invitation .
or the call to tell me that you &apos;d returned to the city .
kind of reminds me of the time
that you came back from boarding school without a word .
i &apos;m not trying to hurt you .
i &apos;m just trying to move on , and so should you .
well , as the hostess of such an elegant event ,
you wouldn &apos;t want to cause a scene . would you ?
nothing is more pressing to me
than making sure this evening goes perfectly ,
which i &apos;m sure you have some sort of scheme to destroy .
so please leave before i have security escort you out .
if you weren &apos;t invited , blair ,
then why are you here ?
blair ! blair ! okay !
i got the last one ,
and i left the model standing in nothing but her la perlas .
or maybe they were kiki . i don &apos;t--i &apos;m not sure .
is ... that one of your waldorf designs ?
no , it &apos;s one of mine ,
and all the models who are supposed to be wearing them
are missing .
what &apos;s going on , blair ?
sage ? what is this ?
why do you care ? i didn &apos;t come here with you .
well , you &apos;re leaving with me now .
i don &apos;t think so .
i didn &apos;t ask .
take your hands off her . she said &quot; no . &quot;
stay out of this .
no , i won &apos;t . you &apos;re the one
who &apos;s supposed to be in a relationship with serena .
wait . this is your girlfriend ?
well , this is my boyfriend .
steven , what are you doing ? !
you know how important tonight is to me ,
and now you &apos;re humiliating me to defend that slut ?
that &quot; slut &quot; happens to be my 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
spotted--nate archibald with a minor problem
that just became a major incident .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you have a daughter ?
obviously because she &apos;s the same age as you are .
now serena is an adult ,
and she &apos;s not missing her curfew and she &apos;s not in high school .
yeah , and i &apos;m not gonna let this drag me back into it .
i have a check to present .
say good night . i &apos;ll be back to take you home .
you &apos;re in high school ?
isn &apos;t that why you broke up with me ?
i broke up with you because
i thought you were sleeping with your father--
before i knew he was your father .
that &apos;s disgusting .
yeah !
i &apos;m not sleeping with anyone but you .
and it &apos;s legal . i checked .
so can we please just go back to your place and do that ?
no ! you &apos;re 17 , and i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re grounded .
i really did audit professor peiser &apos;s class this summer .
and we &apos;re closer in age than my dad and serena .
or you and diana payne .
yeah . i got an &quot; a &quot; on my paper about &quot; the spectator . &quot;
serena , i know you &apos;re upset .
we spent months together ,
and you never mentioned you had a child ,
never mind one who &apos;s old enough to share my clothes .
come on . it took you all summer to tell me your real name .
look , we both needed time
before we were ready to share everything .
even shakespeare said , &quot; what &apos;s in a name ? &quot;
unlike a daughter ,
who &apos;s a huge piece of your life .
yeah , and when women find out about her ,
they either bolt or pressure me to meet her .
and honestly , i ...
i &apos;ve never been ready to introduce her to anyone ...
until you .
you know , i always imagined your first meeting
as more of a breakfast or coffee @-@ type thing .
really ? it wasn &apos;t punching out her boyfriend ?
and the more serious we get ,
the more we &apos;re gonna have to trust each other .
do you think you can do that ?
i really wanna try .
business records , blueprints .
you need to stop this childish nonsense .
you &apos;re the one who faked a text from blair .
classic high school move .
how about we call a truce ?
it would make lily happy .
she &apos;s very upset that you &apos;re trying to destroy our marriage .
i don &apos;t care about your marriage , and neither do you .
of course i do .
why else would i have paid amira all that money to leave town ?
to protect whatever secret
really forced you to fake your death ,
something that &apos;s obviously not in these files .
i already told you .
i did it to keep you and lily safe .
and i wanted to believe it .
i wanted to believe you cared about me ,
that i had finally earned my father &apos;s love .
then let me give you some bass properties ,
and we &apos;ll call ourselves a family again .
oh , no , no , no .
it &apos;s too late for that .
you took everything from me ,
again and again .
now i &apos;m going to find your secret
and i &apos;m going to take everything from you .
maybe it &apos;s not too late to find blair
and help her with those errands .
why are you torturing me ?
blair knew your dresses would look better than hers in print .
no . i knew that the two of you were working together
to destroy me in &quot; w.w.d. &quot;
we met for the first time today , blair , when i interviewed her .
i don &apos;t believe you .
and you and your fake african satellite @-@ selling brain
did not find my fabric on its own .
plus ... i have done terrible things to
the two of you in the past ,
so you must &apos;ve wanted revenge .
i did , but i didn &apos;t scheme to get it .
all i did was set up the article
and let you do what you always do--implode .
one of the things i learned after being run out of manhattan
by a gang of overprivileged teenagers
was to just let my anger go .
fashion design is my art therapy .
so ...
we really just liked the same fabric ?
i better go write my story .
i don &apos;t want to forget any details .
no , no , no ! you can &apos;t write about this !
wait ! maybe she &apos;s right . if you write that article ,
it &apos;ll bring her so much more attention .
maybe you should just write it about me .
i could use the extra space
for more pictures of your collection .
yes .
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t start again from nothing ! nelly !
you can be my head minion .
blair waldorf ,
i &apos;ve been asked to escort you from the party .
think fast , b.
pencil skirts or peplum ?
the only look you have now is egg on your face .
looks good , no ?
skilled craftspeople at work .
i &apos;ve never seen such a beautiful sight .
where did they come from ?
uh , some from paris , some from garment district ,
a few &quot; project runway &quot; rejects .
i know how to enlist employees . i learned from the best .
she &apos;s clapping for you !
thank you , dorota .
now as the new head of waldorf designs ,
i only have one chance to make my debut .
at fashion show for buyers next week .
as much as i love the line we were developing ,
it is no longer viable .
so ... we simply have to do better .
miss blair , i know i know nothing of fashion , but ...
no one can do a whole line in ten days .
i do realize that this is a lot to ask , but ...
we have no choice .
as my mother &apos;s first facialist elizabeth arden said ,
&quot; i only want people around me who can do the impossible . &quot;
we have no time to waste .
i want a picture of every piece my mother has ever designed .
and we need a new inspiration fabric .
who wants to come with me to mood ?
great !
let &apos;s go then .
vite . vite .
heard you got a great offer from &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
i did .
i said no .
did georgina kick you off her couch or what ?
no , i left on my own
after waking up with her staring at me again .
please tell me that means
you &apos;re giving your serial to &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i know you need this to succeed as much as i do ,
but it &apos;s only gonna do that if you print it word for word .
done .
you might wanna check it out before you decide .
you , uh , sure you wanna publish this ?
i am . every word of it is true .
but there are details in here the world doesn &apos;t need to know .
these are people you care about .
nothing good came from my protecting them .
once i realized i live in a world
where chuck bass gets the girl ,
everything seemed very clear .
i &apos;m not playing by anyone else &apos;s rules anymore .
i &apos;m making my own .
if you don &apos;t want thisth i @-@ i can self @-@ publish it .
no , no , no , i want it . i &apos;m just saying ...
i &apos;ve only read one page ,
and i &apos;m guessing you might lose some friends and family .
my &quot; friends &quot; chased my sister out of town
and chose a guy who traded her for a hotel over me .
and my &quot; family ... &quot;
yeah , is sleeping with a con artist .
you know , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m not losing anything here .
i &apos;m taking what &apos;s mine .
在中央公园举办了一场盛会
serena &apos;s gala from last night ?
yes . it looks beautiful in the paper .
i heard there was an unfortunate incident with steven ,
but the board said that serena could keep her seat
because she raised a record amount of money .
sorry i had to step out
and didn &apos;t get home in time for us to make it .
bart , it &apos;s lovely .
it is the least i can do
to make up for all the unfortunate drama
with amira and charles .
i know how important family is to you , lily ,
but i think you need to accept
that my son may no longer want to be part of ours .
well , i &apos;m not ready to give up hope yet .
no one said being a parent would be easy .
some children will do everything in their power
to destroy you .
others will wilt under the weight
of your crushing expectations .
she know you can do this , miss blair .
i hope she &apos;s right .
my entire future , here and with chuck ,
depends on it .
you &apos;re uncharacteristically quiet this morning , sage .
what do you want me to say ?
&quot; thank you for the humiliating experience of being
walked to school by my dad and his trophy girlfriend ? &quot;
i may not be as humiliating as you think .
i went to constance , too , you know .
just remember your end of the deal .
i go to school , and you let me date nate .
oh , you should thank serena for that .
she &apos;s the one that told me he &apos;s a decent guy .
yeah , he was going to st. jude &apos;s while i was at constance ,
but you probably already know that from &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
no one in high school reads &quot; gossip girl &quot; anymore .
it &apos;s for old people . now can i go ,
or do you want to hold my hand all the way to homeroom ?
go . i love you .
and some will become parents themselves .
what can i say except , uh , welcome to adulthood ?
you know i disapprove of teenage pregnancy .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; says your dad is dating serena van der woodsen .
is it true ?
not for long .
but a teenage stepdaughter ?
that &apos;s my kind of fun .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
