but , uh , my wife ordered a new dust ruffle for our bedroom ,
and , uh , she had it shipped to the station .
if i &apos;m not here to sign for it , they &apos;ll take it back
to the package place , and that is a whole nightmare .
love you guys .
15 @-@ 20人吃 面条又厚又宽所以能填肚子
uh , yeah , i got a delivery here for , uh , clancy wiggins .

n @-@ n @-@ no , it &apos;s wiggum .
wiggins ? that &apos;s not even a real name .
what &apos;s a wiggins ?
no , really , tell me .
wh @-@ what is that ?
okay , so you &apos;re not clancy wiggins
who ordered this , uh , skymaster x5000 jet pack .
jet pack ?
of course i &apos;m clancy wiggins , you idiot !
&quot; chief clancy ... jetpack . &quot;
well , boys , justice has a new name--
up .
uh , chief , it says here
you need to take a 40 @-@ hour training course
and get certified before you can legally ...
i &apos;m not the police anymore .
i &apos;m the sky police .
okay , okay .
i think i got it .
no , i got it , i got it .
* sky police *
* chief clancy wiggins is the sky police *
* a floating future cop , sky police *
* fly , police squash perps on their heads they won &apos;t know why they &apos;re dead *
* sky police *
* in my jet pack , i &apos;m flying high above the law *
* i &apos;m just like superman powered by great big fans *
* i &apos;ll kill you all i &apos;m sky police *
ugh , why don &apos;t you take that thing off , chief ?
it &apos;s starting to smell .
what , so you can steal it and be sky police ?
oh , no . no way .
i &apos;m brigadier general clancy wiggins .
apparently a military @-@ issue jet pack
was mistakenly delivered here
while i received this off @-@ brand dust ruffle .
well , there &apos;s only one floating future cop
who can find that missing jet pack--
the sky police .
* this is the end of sky police *
you were the wind beneath my ass .
stupid church .
why would jesus want us to waste our weekend
on extra boring , no @-@ recess , dress @-@ up school ?
exactly .
the dude was a carpenter .
and those guys like to kick back on sundays .
and i mean kick back .
guys , church is good for your souls .
and remember , god is listening to your prayers .
what percentage of prayers really come true ?
well , not all of them .
like , um , 90 % ?
god doesn &apos;t hear my prayers .
if he did , i &apos;d be at home on the couch playing video games
in a diaper .
oh , god gets your prayers ,
but he just clicks delete without reading them ,
like e @-@ mail updates from linkedin .
i hope no one was hurt .
so no church ?
my prayers were answered .
don &apos;t worry , reverend , according to your policy ,
your church is covered for everything but acts of god .
but we believe
everything that happens everywhere is an act of god .
my jiminy , you &apos;re right !
we &apos;re off the hook ! hey !
those cornell men at the head office are gonna
be doing the saluki strut tonight !
go southern illinois !
saluki strut !
so we have no money to repair the church .
and developers are itching to build on our land .
fast @-@ casual dining downstairs ,
live @-@ work lofts upstairs ,
and as an anchor store--
a chain pharmacy .
why , it &apos;s a mixed @-@ use nightmare !
this building is the heart of our community .
we have our weddings here , our funerals .
our fun runs begin and end here .
i will not rest until it is rebuilt .
i can &apos;t believe it ,
but the church is going to have to ask people for money .
who keeps putting pickle slices in here ?
i think i can help you get the money that you need .
but you don &apos;t go to our church .
granted , i do not share your faith ,
but the yahoos in this town need a church
to deliver weekly reminders not to steal-- from me .
and not to take a life-- my life .
yar , without organized religion ,
i &apos;ve lost me moral compass .
also i &apos;ve , uh , i &apos;ve been addicted to oxy
for a while now ... yar .
now , this is what i have got in mind .
i will whisper even though we are alone .
all right , people , marge has brought this heathen
to aid us in our time of need .
please do not call me a heathen .
it offends hanuman , the monkey @-@ headed lord of winds ,
who believed the sun to be a ripe mango ...
okay , i get it , i get why you say it .
apu thinks we can get the money
at the casino playing blackjack .
the casino ? !
blackjack &apos;s for suckers .
my brother ?
he used to own three arby &apos;s franchises .
lost &apos; em all at the tables
and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy .
but you told me uncle stevie moved to okinawa .
what i told you was to wait in the car .
no , no , you can beat the house .
by counting cards .
i myself have done it--
when i was a student at mit ,
the mumbai institute of tantric sex ,
where i was recruited by a card @-@ counting ring .
i won enough money to buy fake sat scores
i used to get into the real mit ,
where i failed every class and was kicked out
and had to move to springfield .
am i hearing this right ?
is the church council truly considering gambling ?
you know , ned ,
the bible never explicitly condemns gambling .
biblical folks were always playing games of chance ,
like , uh , drawing lots .
leviticus drew lots .
joshua drew lots , nehemiah .
even the apostles were lot @-@ drawers .
if gambling &apos;s okay ,
then i &apos;m getting health insurance for the kids .
card counting is not gambling .
it is math .
and it &apos;s not even against the rules .
exactly .
if you are caught , you cannot be charged with any crime .
the worst they will do is beat you with a phone book
or break some fingers .
but what is a little pain
if your church is to be saved ?
it is all good .
counting cards requires absolute focus .
you must ignore all casino distractions .
and beware of cocktail waitresses
with free drinks and eyeball @-@ height cleavage .
they &apos;re not attractive , but you cannot look away .
freshen your drink , hon ?
who had the scotch and soda ?
cocktails . cocktails .
another one , hon ?
you , what is the count ? !
get your head in the game , mel !
now remember , for this legal @-@ but @-@ frowned @-@ upon scheme to work ,
we must have complete secrecy .
do not tell anyone what you are doing .
not even homer ?
homer is many things
but not a good accomplice .
if he gets involved and this scheme fails ,
what happens to our church ?
oh , even i saw that .
i guess i can &apos;t tell homer .
i &apos;m leaving for my fund @-@ raising meeting .
don &apos;t wait up .
why are you church @-@ os getting together so late ?
i &apos;m asking because i &apos;m supposed to care about things .
well , to raise money , we &apos;re ...
putting on a revue .
well , you can &apos;t go wrong with a revue .
skits and songs ?
i &apos;m entertained already .
yeah , so , uh ...
i &apos;m going out to rehearse ...
the revue .
go .
go make magic .
you just go .
revue .
card counting is simple .
all sit at different tables , betting low ,
playing hand after hand ,
counting in your head how many high cards
are left in the deck .
ignore all distractions .
when the count is high , you have a &quot; hot deck , &quot;
and the odds are in your favor .
then you use a secret signal to call in &quot; the closer . &quot;
the closer bets big , wins bigger ,
and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim
of a morally acceptable screw job .
but use caution-- there are eyes everywhere .
sooner or later , the casino will catch on .
and that is when you must flash the &quot; get the hell out &quot; signal .
what a haul .
one more night like this ,
and we &apos;ll be able to fix the church in style .
恢弘的尖顶
what a rush-- it got my blood pumping
in a way i thought only quiet reflection could .
fizzy water for everyone .
i think we can do something a little harder than that .
now , that &apos;s a marshmallow @-@ y s &apos;more @-@ garita .
homer , homer , we did it .
wh @-@ what &apos;d you do ?
we &apos;re going to save the church .
i feel like celebrating .
b @-@ but ... but it &apos;s not on the calendar .
okay , but if i &apos;m sleepy at work tomorrow ,
i get to tell everyone why .
oh , boy , oh , boy .
1 a.m. loving and 2 a.m. steak ?
night @-@ marriage rules !
i guess nothing gets the heart pumping
like a church revue .
yeah , yeah , the revue .
oh , i got so many questions .
what are the skits about ?
uh , pop culture and current events .
how do you transition between scenes ?
hard blackouts or spotlight fades ?
uh , both .
nice .
you know , it wouldn &apos;t be a revue without songs .
tell me about one .
okay , uh , there &apos;s a song about , um ...
how democrats and republicans can &apos;t get along .
it &apos;s called , &quot; cats and dogs . &quot;
you got yourself one hell of a show , marge .
one hell of a show .
okay , okay , don &apos;t get cocky ,
you rapture @-@ waiting baby @-@ baptizers .
you had one good night , but now the casino is on to you .
they &apos;re not going to let you
anywhere near those blackjack tables ,
unless you wear these .
disguises ?
i &apos;m worried our scam is becoming dishonest .
relax , marge .
if god lets the jews have sunday on a saturday ,
he &apos;ll be cool with this .
why , i bet the lord is pleased as punch
that we &apos;re using that dirty casino money
to rebuild his temple .
our mission is 100 % pure .
where has this been all my life ?
i could be sideshow ... anyone .
i &apos;m telling mom about how the school freezer broke ,
and they had to cook all the tater tots ,
and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes .
i &apos;m telling her !
you never let me tell .
mom , the freezer broke and ...
cooked all the tater tots .
cooked all the tater tots .
and there were too many tots .
too many tots .
and there were manila envelopes .
manila envelopes .
and the teachers took them home ...
i hate you !
okay , mel .
i &apos;ll be at the casino by 10 : 00 .
meet me at the lounge by the j. geils cover band .
mom , why are you going to a casino ?
are you ... a hostess ?
actually , my friends and i are using a system
to win money to save the church .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gambling .
it &apos;s not gambling .
it &apos;s math .
is dad in on this takedown ?
it &apos;s not a takedown .
and i haven &apos;t told him about it . yet .
but it &apos;s okay for you guys to know
because you &apos;re finally grown @-@ up enough
to be trusted with adult information .
yeah , we are grown @-@ up .
i know how much to tip a waiter .
i go on hikes with my friends
where we talk about our problems .
i &apos;ll tell your dad everything
in the morning when we have the money .
but until then , i appreciate
you keeping this very grown @-@ up secret .
dump that money on the bed .
i &apos;m taking a franklin bath .
dear lord , thank you for granting us the gift
of rationalization to allow us to scheme and swindle
so that we might honor you .
amen .
homie .
homie , i can finally tell you
how we really got the money .
homie ?
uh , marge ?
some casino guys have me ,
and they want the money you took from them or else .
this is all my fault .
just tell me one thing , marge .
why did you lose faith in the revue ?
i mean , &quot; cats and dogs &quot; writes itself .
* cats and dogs on capitol hill *
* they don &apos;t get along and never will *
* cats and dogs squabbles never ending *
homie , how did you end up at the casino ?
well , i was taking a moment
to enjoy my after @-@ dinner night cap ...
dad , mom trusted us with a secret .
but she hasn &apos;t come home yet ,
and we &apos;re worried she &apos;s in trouble .
what ? !
mom &apos;s counting cards at the casino !
oh , if anything happens to marge ,
we &apos;ll all be orphans !
i &apos;m coming for you , baby .
have you seen this woman ?
have you ?
have you seen my wife ?
this is your wife ?
do you know where she is ?
uh , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions
in our &quot; beating room . &quot;
all right , as long as it &apos;s just questions .
reverend ! reverend !
they took homer !
why are you still dressed like that ?
oh , asphodel ...
your corpse bride is getting cold .
uh , one second , belladonna .
helen and i have found that , uh ,
these new personas have been quite liberating .
was that a woman &apos;s voice ?
send her in .
if we don &apos;t give back the money we won counting cards ,
the casino people are going to hurt homer .
tiny snafu .
i &apos;ve already given the money to the contractor .
then we &apos;ll just have to ask that contractor
to give the money back .
give the money back ?
hey , jerry , th @-@ they want the money back .
la dama azul quiere devolver el dinero .
are you gonna put my head in a vice ?
we don &apos;t do that-- we don &apos;t even have a vice .
we just want the money your wife stole from us .
stole ? how is counting cards stealing ?
well , it &apos;s not really stealing .
is it even cheating ?
no , but it &apos;s just not allowed .
i don &apos;t get it .
football players can do the quarterback sneak
and baseball players can steal bases .
why can &apos;t i just remember which cards have been played ?
i can &apos;t take any more of this guy .
get the vice !
i knew you had a vice .
i knew it .
i knew it .
i ... knew it .
i &apos;m sorry , marge .
maybe your husband &apos;s suffering was all part of god &apos;s plan .
god &apos;s plan ?
god isn &apos;t some video gamer up there controlling us
like we were pac @-@ men and dig dugs .
god isn &apos;t sky police .
god didn &apos;t do this .
i lied to my husband .
and made my kids lie , too .
we did this .
she &apos;s right .
we thought we could enter the den of sin
and emerge unscathed ,
but we were scathed .
those free ginger ales at the casino ,
i @-@ i didn &apos;t declare them on my taxes .
i &apos;m going to do
what i should have done in the first place .
put on a revue ?
dear lord , i don &apos;t have anywhere to pray anymore ,
so i &apos;ve come to your new temple-- here .
um , i don &apos;t know if you watch us all the time ,
or if we &apos;re just like an ant farm you got for your birthday
and left on the shelf , and every once in a while ,
you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we &apos;ve built .
maybe we got it all wrong ,
praying for you to give us things we selfishly want .
maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself
that there is good in the universe .
and i &apos;m going to sit here and focus on that good ,
and maybe , just maybe , i &apos;ll get my husband back .
i &apos;m doug blattner ,
coo of the gaming and resorts division
of stuffers italian foods .
my family loves your microwave lasagnas .
it &apos;s not my division ,
but i &apos;ll tell bill kelley you said so .
your unsanctioned religious gathering has caused
a marked decrease in gambling activities .
hpms are down ... that &apos;s hands per minute .
iams , gdcs-- they &apos;re all down .
i want my husband back .
hmm , let me run it by jennifer yang .
oh , wait , she &apos;s on maternity leave .
don &apos;t worry-- i &apos;m sure chuck bennett will sign off on it .
we are going to release your husband .
see , marge , someone up in the sky did hear your prayers .
they sure did-- casino management .
you are free to leave
as long as your faith @-@ based card @-@ counting group
never return to this or any other river or maritime casino .
no deal !
but we don &apos;t need to come back .
we saved the church .
no ! an injustice has gone on here for too long !
i &apos;m not leaving this casino
until you stop punishing people for counting cards .
they &apos;re just playing the game
by the rules .
homie , after all this , do you still believe in god ?
on a beautiful night like tonight ,
how could i not ?
