you know how much i love you , amanda ?
infinity ?
well , infinity ...
times infinity .
in another life , my name was amanda clarke .
you &apos;re barely gonna notice the cold at all .
i was raised by my father david ...
are you ready ?
until the day he was convicted for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge fund executive david clarke .
grayson &apos;s testimony detailed the scheme
clarke used to channel money to the terrorists
responsible for the downing of flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7 .
i grew up on my own and changed my identity .
i &apos;m now known as emily thorne ,
and i &apos;ve spent my whole life acquiring the skills
to exact revenge on those who destroyed my father .
i &apos;ve learned that vengeance is not for the impulsive
and that anger must be tempered with skill .
this is the story of my road to revenge
from the beginning .
coming back to the hamptons after so many years
felt like coming home .
but it was also the place where i last saw my father .
daddy !
whoa ! whoa ! what &apos;s going on ?
hands up so i can see &apos; em .
what &apos;s going on ? !
you &apos;re making a mistake .
you &apos;re making a mistake !
daddy !
get your hands off my daughter !
amanda ! amanda !
now you have to imagine ,
it &apos;s memorial day weekend ,
75 and sunny ,
all those boys of summer wondering who the new girl is .
an air of mystery can be very useful when plotting revenge .
and i would use it to my advantage .
i &apos;ll take it .
hello , hello .
ashley , hey . should i get us some glasses ?
i wish . it &apos;s for victoria grayson .
who ?
you are hopeless .
victoria grayson , the reigning queen of the hamptons .
not to mention your new next door neighbor .
queen victoria .
mm . believe me . she &apos;s earned the title .
in truth , victoria grayson was no stranger to me .
she and my father were in love and carrying on an affair
until an even greater scandal erupted .
i &apos;ve made a terrible , terrible mistake .
it was victoria &apos;s husband conrad
who had been laundering money for the terrorists
responsible for the plane crash .
the investigation &apos;s gonna tie it back to the company .
i &apos;m gonna go to prison for the rest of my life ,
if i &apos;m lucky .
they &apos;re gonna freeze all of our assets ,
and you &apos;re gonna have to raise daniel alone
under a cloud of disgrace .
afraid of losing everything ,
victoria helped hatch a plan to frame my father ...
and changed the course of our lives forever .
amanda !
daddy !
i grew up in institutions and foster homes
and was told nothing but lies .
you know you will never see that man again ,
because he hurt people ,
because he killed people .
that &apos;s a lie .
if you don &apos;t stop challenging me on this ,
you might wind up spending the rest of
your childhood in this place .
it was only upon my release from juvenile detention
that i learned the truth .
who are you ?
nolan ross . friend of your father &apos;s .
you &apos;re not exactly the little angel he described .
my father hasn &apos;t seen me in ten years .
i &apos;m sorry to be the one to tell you .
he passed away ...
six weeks ago .
he wanted you to have something .
your father was the first person to believe in me .
he invested in my company when no one else would .
now that you &apos;re 18,
you &apos;re officially 49 % owner of my company .
&quot; my dear amanda .
i am not the man they say i am .
and i did not do the things they say i did .
all i ask is that you promise to do
the one thing that &apos;s been so hard for me to do .
forgive . &quot;
but that was a request i could not grant .
using the evidence left behind by my father ,
i began to take down everyone
who had helped bring about his downfall .
i &apos;m lydia davis .
my husband and i own the house you &apos;re staying in .
oh .
welcome to the hamptons .
lydia davis was one of many
who gave false testimony against my father .
she was an employee at grayson global .
i &apos;m just glad i can help put that monster away .
now she was conrad grayson &apos;s mistress
and victoria &apos;s best friend .
the importance of preparation cannot be underestimated .
i had everything i needed to expose the affair .
set it up by the windows , please .
they say revenge is a dish best served cold .
and i &apos;d like some , uh , pepper in my bisque .
but sometimes it &apos;s as warm as a bowl of soup .
conrad !
is he gonna be okay ?
ma &apos;am , i need you to step back , please .
where are you taking him ?
southfork hospital .
lydia .
one , two ...
emily thorne .
three .
my--my god . is this your husband ?
do you need a ride to the hospital ?
no , i don &apos;t . i ...
oh , my god , conrad . i thought i was going to find you dead .
i &apos;m fine .
as far as i can tell ,
your husband &apos;s as healthy as a thoroughbred .
but i do suggest that he stay away
from the southfork inn &apos;s spicy bisque for a while .
the southfork inn ?
yeah .
it wasn &apos;t long before victoria and i had our first encounter .
mrs. grayson , i just wanted to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine .
victoria grayson , emily thorne .
hello , mrs. grayson .
ah , ms. thorne .
lydia , hi .
emily is renting my house for the summer .
we met briefly on the beach .
and then yesterday at the southfork inn .
i hope your husband &apos;s feeling better .
good afternoon , everyone ,
and happy memorial day .
i &apos;d like to announce the winner of the art auction .
my dear friend ...
lydia davis .
have ms. davis escorted off the boat .
and in related news , lydia has asked me
to announce that the beach house she shared with her husband
is officially on the market .
ms. davis ? come with me , please .
i &apos;m afraid this will be her final weekend in the hamptons .
so call your realtors , ladies and gentlemen ,
because this one &apos;s going to go fast .
ruining lydia was my first step in taking down the graysons ,
but my plan ran much deeper .
oh , my god . oh !
i &apos;m so sorry . god , i &apos;m such an idiot .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s , uh , probably the universe
telling me i need a costume change .
uh ... i &apos;m daniel .
emily .
how about i get you a dry martini ?
twice the alcohol , half the stain potential .
sure . i &apos;m sorry .
no , no . it &apos;s okay . now wait right here .
daniel was the graysons oldest child ,
the heir to their misbegotten fortune .
daniel .
your father and i are leaving .
thank you for a lovely party , mrs. grayson .
it was great meeting both of you .
well , now that you &apos;ve moved in next door ,
i suppose we &apos;ll be seeing a lot of you this summer .
getting close to victoria &apos;s only son ...
i &apos;ll expect you shortly , daniel .
would give me the leverage i needed .
don &apos;t let my mom rattle you .
intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her .
i &apos;d hate to be on her bad side .
yes , you would .
when seeking revenge ,
you must be prepared for the inevitable .
yes ?
i want you to find out everything you can
about a young woman named emily thorne .
your greatest adversary may be planning the same fate for you .
moments ago , a jury found terrorist ...
my mission to avenge the injustices of the past
was off to a productive start .
well , well , well .
if it isn &apos;t the thorne in everyone &apos;s side .
and someone from that past
would prove to be a useful resource .
with his loyalty to my father and technical brilliants ,
nolan was the perfect accomplice .
is it possible to hack a computer tablet
to run a powerpoint presentation ?
possible for you or possible for me ?
can you do it or not ?
with both hands tied behind my back .
one by one , with nolan &apos;s help ,
those who played a part in the plot against my father fell .
a state psychiatrist placed me in an institution
after victoria offered her a private practice
with wealthy clients .
i exposed their secrets at a society party ...
i drove my children to summer camp
loaded on painkillers and vodka .
finishing the doctor &apos;s career in one stroke .
i am going to destroy you .
after my father &apos;s trial ,
the federal prosecutor who convicted him
rose to political prominence .
how &apos;d you get your hands on a sex tape ?
i bought the building that his mistress lives in .
as part of the renovations , i had cameras installed .
you scare me .
good .
with a few more pawns overturned ,
i moved further into the queen &apos;s territory .
go , daniel !
go , daniel ! go , daniel !
off to a rough start , huh ?
ah , i was hoping you wouldn &apos;t be here to see this .
you know , you &apos;re making it very difficult for me
to impress you .
i &apos;m already impressed .
would you like to go out sometime ?
riding ?
yeah , riding or ...
just dinner .
win the match , and it &apos;s yes to both .
and if i lose ?
then we &apos;ll see .
thanks for meeting me , frank .
what were you able to find out ?
filthy rich and squeaky clean as far as i can tell .
why are you so interested in this girl anyway ?
because she &apos;s interested in my son .
daniel mentioned that
you were captain of an equestrian team in barcelona .
uh , yes . just for a semester .
what are some of your other interests ?
history for one .
i &apos;m practically obsessed with it .
emily ?
hi .
hi . what &apos;s going on ?
well , your mother invited me over for tea .
i should get going , really .
i have to work out some issues with my realtor .
i &apos;ve just become the official new owner of the beach house .
that &apos;s great news . congratulations .
thank you .
now how about i make good on that date
and take you out to celebrate ?
that sounds great . how about tomorrow ?
yeah , tomorrow &apos;s perfect .
i know just the place . come on . i &apos;ll walk you out .
thank you so much for tea , mrs. grayson .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i &apos;ve enjoyed this .
but i never waste time enjoying small victories .
come here .
when you let your guard down ,
you become vulnerable ...
and your own heart might give you away .
sammy !
sam ?
come here , sammy . i found a stick for you .
what &apos;s his name ?
sam .
fetch it , sammy .
nice throw .
thanks .
sammy !
sammy , get down !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
sorry . he &apos;s not normally this friendly .
he &apos;s kind of an old grump , actually .
oh , he got mud on your dress .
oh , that &apos;s no big deal .
there &apos;s an earl and emma &apos;s dry cleaners
right around the corner .
i &apos;ll walk you over .
oh , that &apos;s okay .
um , i got it . thanks .
despite the pull of lost love ,
you must never lose sight of your ultimate objective .
i hope my mother wasn &apos;t too hard on you the other day .
i don &apos;t scare too easily .
what about your parents ?
they passed away when i was a kid .
car crash .
i &apos;m so sorry .
but maybe you can set down some roots of your own now .
yeah , maybe .
i had a really good time tonight .
me , too .
contending with the element of surprise
is an essential skill in the art of revenge .
please tell me you &apos;re the a.v. guy .
wish i could .
tyler barrol ,
daniel &apos;s roommate at harvard .
tyler &apos;s ambitions were transparent ...
my internship at stern investments just fell through .
and as usual , their loss is grayson global &apos;s gain .
when can you start ?
you tell me , sir .
get yourself dressed . you start today .
and he wasted no time
ingratiating himself with the graysons .
where &apos;s the ledger for the offshore accounts ?
already boxed up , sir .
i don &apos;t know where my head &apos;s at today .
my goal is to become indispensible to you .
well , you &apos;re fast approaching it , son .
hey , handsome .
oops . thought you were daniel .
ah . sorry to disappoint .
i was just on my way to the fish market ,
thought i &apos;d see how daniel felt about rock shrimp .
danny &apos;s allergic to shellfish .
well , good thing i was here .
you coulda killed the guy .
you sure know a lot about him .
yeah , well ... best friends are like that .
right . harvard boys .
so , uh , what time do you want him ,
7 : 00 , 8 : 00 ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll just give him a call .
did i just hear emily ?
yeah . she just took off .
she said that something &apos;s come up
and she had to cancel dinner .
she say why ?
sorry .
the calculated moves of my unexpected rival
weren &apos;t immediately apparent .
frustration can cloud your judgment ,
and any distraction is welcome .
emily .
hi .
these are from sammy
as a way of saying thank you
for bringing him home last week ... twice .
that &apos;s very nice of sammy , but--
oh . i should &apos;ve called first .
you-- you &apos;re in the middle of something .
yes , i am in the middle of something .
and that happens to be an exceptionally good bottle of pinot .
do you drink wine ?
well , when it &apos;s exceptional ,
sure .
cheers .
we &apos;re all drawn to the warmth of a true connection .
but avoid getting too close to an open flame ...
or someone is sure to get burned .
what &apos;s my little girl with the infinity tattoo up to today ?
suddenly she &apos;s thinking of filing a restraining order .
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to try and be nice to me .
not part of the plan .
that certainly hasn &apos;t stopped you
from cozying up to daniel grayson .
that &apos;s because he actually is part of the plan .
but even the best @-@ laid plans can be disrupted
when a woman scored returns to seek her own revenge .
michael &apos;s attorney presented these to the judge ,
and they triggered the fidelity clause in our prenup .
i get nothing .
i am sorry , lydia .
really , i- i am , but ...
what can i do about it ?
you can write me a check ...
a big one .
if i &apos;m gonna get my life back ,
then i need victoria to accept me .
get her on board , conrad .
otherwise--
otherwise what ?
another empty threat ?
empty ?
how does this sound ?
&quot; the graysons are incredibly powerful , your honor .
&quot; i was intimidated into helping them frame david clarke .
and then threatened by their head of security
if i didn &apos;t comply . &quot;
the prosecution rests . &quot;
thanks to nolan ,
we had a front @-@ row seat to the drama unfolding
between lydia and the graysons .
but no one was prepared for how it would escalate .
i tried to reason with her .
lydia doesn &apos;t want money anymore .
the only thing that &apos;ll placate her
is if victoria welcomes her back into the fold .
i am not welcoming that scheming harlot anywhere
until we &apos;ve exhausted all our options .
well , there &apos;s definitely more aggressive ways
to handle the situation .
oh , hold on a minute .
she &apos;s a lonely socialite . she &apos;s not an ax murderer .
look , victoria , you asked me to call her bluff once .
i say we do it tonight .
well , that was before i found out
how completely unhinged she &apos;s become .
who knows what that woman &apos;s capable of ?
she could be behind everything .
i &apos;ll get into it .
but if victoria &apos;s suspicions are right ,
we handle this my way .
victoria , you were right .
lydia is behind everything .
i just found her open arms speech on her computer .
she &apos;s planning to expose you tonight .
you have proof of this ?
i &apos;m staring at it right now .
she writes , &quot; ladies and gentlemen ,
everyone here tonight is a victim--
a victim of fraud and deceit so dark and despicable
that it has taken me 15 terrible years
to tell the truth about the monsters responsible . &quot;
what the hell are you doing here ?
it was all you--
destroying senator kingsly ,
dr. banks , extorting conrad .
you really take this woman scored thing seriously ,
don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . get out !
help !
somebody , help !
lydia &apos;s accident was not part of the plan .
but instead of cleaning up the mess myself ...
i let others do the dirty work for me .
victoria , it &apos;s frank .
lydia davis just jumped off her balcony .
call me when you get this .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
not if they believe it &apos;s all been frank .
frank dug his own grave .
all we need is for victoria and conrad to bury him in it .
our man frank was trying to kill her , victoria .
there &apos;s no reason to believe that he won &apos;t do the same
to either of us .
the time has come for us to go our separate ways .
are you firing me ?
i can trust you anymore .
you can &apos;t trust me ?
you wouldn &apos;t be sitting here if it wasn &apos;t for me .
you &apos;d be in a federal prison , rotting .
okay , which is why i wrote a second check in your name .
i suggest you go someplace very far away from here .
dispensing with complications is a necessary evil .
but matters of the heart require more care .
ever since i first saw you ...
i knew there was something about you .
this feeling comes along once or twice in a lifetime
if we &apos;re lucky .
tell me i &apos;m alone in this ,
and i won &apos;t bother you again .
i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
there was no time to dwell on the past
with other affairs to show up .
beginning to question if you lived here anymore .
well , then we &apos;re even , because i was
beginning to question if you &apos;d lost my number .
actually , i lost my phone .
tyler told me you canceled dinner .
what is he talking about ?
i came by to see what you like to eat .
i &apos;ll kill him .
i stared at an empty chair for two hours
until i finally accepted that you had stood me up .
the chair didn &apos;t look so empty to me .
i saw you and jack through the windows .
i know . i &apos;m not proud of it .
i made that dinner for you , daniel .
jack and i are just friends .
he came by unexpected . he was hungry .
i didn &apos;t want the food to go to waste .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
and so we &apos;re headed to the berry islands on a g @-@ 5
because , well , they &apos;re looking for a tax haven ,
and they want me to show them around .
so where do you guys fly into down there ?
most of the airstrips are so short .
half are unpaved .
i don &apos;t know . we just landed .
on a dirt runway in a $ 60 million plane ?
why would anybody want to hide their money in the bahamas ?
their privacy laws were stripped in &apos; 06 .
what &apos;s your point ?
either you &apos;re confused
or you &apos;re giving spectacularly bad advice .
forget it . i &apos;m just trying to tell a story .
oh , i believe that .
you know what ?
tyler , come on . don &apos;t be like that .
who does she think she &apos;s talking to anyways ?
that &apos;s a very good question .
i &apos;m outta here .
sorry , ashley .
tyler--
he is doing everything he can to come between daniel and me .
i need you to find something for me to use
to discredit him with the graysons .
just tell me what the hell you want .
direct . i like that in my negotiations .
well , upon some research ,
i noticed that all your bills last summer
were paid kept @-@ boy style .
tell me ,
what &apos;s a gay hustler doing posing as a harvard student ?
gay ? eh .
hustler ?
maybe .
ambiguous sexual identity .
i get it .
i &apos;m about a ...
3 on the kinsey scale myself .
still doesn &apos;t explain what you &apos;re up to .
you got me .
you did say this was a negotiation so ...
let &apos;s make a deal .
i &apos;m impressed . how &apos;d you do it ?
well , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
i took a page from the angel of revenge herself ,
dug up some dirt , used it for leverage .
what &apos;s the dirt ?
suffice it to say
our boy is a bit of a con man .
what he doesn &apos;t know is , you can &apos;t con a con .
well , whatever you &apos;re doing , keep it up .
oh , i plan to .
never underestimate
the lengths to which a desperate man will go .
you looking for this ?
this is some serious firepower , ms. thorne .
seems unnecessary .
well , that depends on what i &apos;m up against .
you work for the graysons , don &apos;t you ?
no , not anymore .
lost my job ...
due to some strange events .
there &apos;s been a lot of that going around
since you came to town .
at first i thought victoria was just paranoid about you .
but not anymore .
there &apos;s more to your story , little lady ...
and i &apos;m gonna find out what it is .
with a little digging ...
ghosts from the past can be conjured from thin air .
hello , emily thorne .
it &apos;s when they become flesh and blood
that the real problems arise .
$ 50 for the lap dance .
actually , um , i just want to talk .
you &apos;re one of those .
it &apos;s your money .
what do you want to talk about ?
your name &apos;s not really amanda clarke , is it ?
it &apos;s emily thorne .
so here &apos;s the way that i see it--
the girl passing herself off as emily thorne
needed a new identity .
and who better than her orphaned cell mate
straight out of juvie ?
i &apos;m sure she gave you what seemed like
a lot of money at the time .
half a million dollars ?
this is your fake i.d. and passport .
you &apos;re not having second thoughts , are you ?
only if that check bounces .
it won &apos;t .
does anyone else know you found me ?
not yet .
my shift &apos;s over in an hour .
meet me in the parking lot ?
hello .
your suspicions were right all along .
emily thorne is not who she claims to--
frank ?
frank , are you there ?
frank !
oh , god . it &apos;s really you .
i need you to keep an eye on somebody for me .
i left my old friend in safe hands for a time
while i made a plan
to get rid of her as fast as possible .
but i wasn &apos;t fast enough .
enjoying the show ?
i should have known that amanda
would take advantage of any opportunity that came her way .
so that &apos;s the famous jack porter .
all the stories you told me about him in juvie ,
i feel like ... i already know him .
get inside . this isn &apos;t a game .
i never said it was .
and in case you forgot ,
i don &apos;t like people telling me what to do .
nothing &apos;s more dangerous than someone who knows
everything about your past ,
especially when she can use it as her own .
is there any chance you might stick around
a little while longer ?
i want to .
but , um , it &apos;s complicated .
yeah .
nolan said as much .
nolan isn &apos;t a friend of mine .
not really .
he knew my father many years ago .
so did you .
amanda ?
i want to come home , jack .
multiple code reds , ems .
the talented mr. hamptons
did a web search on david clarke .
you think he &apos;s onto you ?
i should never have trusted you to take down tyler .
hey , i can handle tyler .
then handle him .
with so much beginning to unravel ...
i needed guidance .
years ago , i met a man who trained me ...
in the ancient ways of revenge .
it &apos;s time you come to japan .
he returned to help me again .
this is satoshi takeda .
he is the c.e.o. of japan &apos;s largest renewable resources company .
i learn something new about you every day .
i fear i &apos;m losing control .
as you were warned ,
revenge is a stony path .
remember ,
inside the viper &apos;s nest
you must be a viper , too .
how can i be of service ?
the task in front of you requires
absolute focus .
if you let your emotions guide you ,
you will fail .
with a renewed sense of purpose ,
i did what was necessary to remove another obstacle .
the only reason that nolan invested with your father
was because tyler &apos;s blackmailing him .
blackmailing him with what ?
it &apos;s come to my attention , you garnered mr. ross &apos; support
through less @-@ than @-@ honorable circumstances .
you &apos;re fired .
you need to go .
now .
step ahead of you .
i got myself a ticket back to cali tonight .
i thought maybe you could come with me .
come on . we &apos;re best buds , remember ?
we &apos;re nothing , tyler . we &apos;re done .
that &apos;s impossible .
we know way too much about each other .
and i know way too much about your family .
are you threatening me ?
have a nice life , danny .
a birthday party in daniel &apos;s honor
was the perfect occasion to introduce victoria
to the young woman everyone thought was amanda clarke .
what brings you to town ?
i just came for a visit .
but i &apos;m thinking of making it more permanent .
if everyone would head down to the beach , the food is ready .
it was a delightful evening in the making ...
where on earth is emily ?
ah , there she is .
happy birthday ...
but there was another surprise guest .
come on , people . yes . big finish .
happy birthday , dear daniel .
happy birthday to you .
make a wish .
how &apos; bout a party game , huh ?
let &apos;s call it
truth or die ?
okay , conny . you &apos;re up first .
you have three seconds to tell everyone the truth
about what really happened to david clarke ,
or i swear , once again , someone is going to die
because you were too weak to own up to your lies .
question is ... who ?
get off of me ! let me go !
man , you &apos;re not going anywhere .
i knew that tyler &apos;s recklessness
would eventually lead to his own collapse .
when the sand settled , it was time to get back to work .
after my father was imprisoned ,
he was eager to tell his side of the story
to an impartial listener .
&quot; i thought mason treadwell
would be that person . &quot;
and so did i.
i &apos;m here because your father says he &apos;s innocent .
i don &apos;t think he did it .
i don &apos;t either .
treadwell made it seem like i could rescue my father
by telling him what i knew .
but the graysons made sure
that the book corroborated their story instead .
my father &apos;s name was dragged through the mud again .
and no element of his story has been born out by facts ?
not a shred .
amanda met with treadwell
to give him a much @-@ anticipated follow @-@ up interview .
finally , i could say my piece .
you didn &apos;t print a word of what i said to you .
i told you the truth ,
that i had seen my father and victoria grayson together .
you were a child .
your mental state was in question .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t possibly take your word for it .
no .
you chose to take hers .
and you were paid handsomely for that endorsement , i &apos;m sure .
one way or another , the truth will come out .
go , amanda .
treadwell had kept the interview tapes
he &apos;d used to write his best seller
under lock and key .
the information on those tapes
could help me accomplish all that i &apos;d set out to do .
no ! no .
no !
but there were some surprises in store for me as well .
i &apos;m telling you , six months ago ,
victoria gave birth to a baby girl .
her name is charlotte .
ask her who the father is ?
charlotte had grown up a grayson .
her romance with jack &apos;s younger brother declan
had ruffled feathers .
but discovering her real father &apos;s identity
would shatter everything she knew .
still , it was time to reveal the truth .
i planted the treadwell tapes
where i knew they would be found .
emily , what are you doing in here ?
jack , i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
i ... was looking for amanda .
she was , uh ,
whe was summoned to the grayson manor
for tea with victoria .
why don &apos;t you cut the crap
and tell me what i &apos;m really doing here ?
mason believes that you have
some sort of vendetta against us .
and this dovetails very nicely
with this uncanny sense i have
that his house didn &apos;t just burn down accidently .
word on the street is ,
you lit that match so you could pin it on me .
is that so ?
commitment is built on compromise .
emily thorne , will you marry me ?
yes .
becoming daniel &apos;s wife would make me a grayson ,
but it would also grant me
ultimate access to what i wanted most .
our engagement party would bring everyone together
for what was sure to be an unforgettable evening .
when jack discovered one of the treadwell tapes ,
he saw the little girl who still had a hold on his heart .
find the lady with the dark hair .
she was there the night they took him away .
they kissed on the lips all the time .
do you know the name of this woman ?
victoria .
sometimes the lies we tell
aren &apos;t nearly as useful as the truth .
the graysons framed my father .
they were responsible for that plane going down .
they set him up to take the fall .
i came back to avenge my father &apos;s death
and to take everything away from them .
you need to go to save yourself ...
and jack .
i can &apos;t say good @-@ bye to him .
then i &apos;ll do it for you .
you couldn &apos;t just leave her the hell alone .
jack , i--
excuse me . porter , we &apos;re kinda in the middle
of a family dinner here , so--
back off , grayson .
mr. porter , you have some nerve coming here .
i &apos;ve got some nerve ? what did you say
to amanda clarke to make her leave town ?
obviously , you &apos;ve been misinformed .
as misinformed as david clarke was
when amanda saw you kissing him ?
you have an active imagination .
who needs imagination ?
i &apos;ve seen the videotape .
if you don &apos;t stop telling lies about amanda clarke ,
i &apos;m gonna start telling the truth about you .
jack .
hey , wait up .
mom , what is he talking about ?
somebody better tell me what &apos;s going on right now
or i swear--
charlotte , sweetheart , you said
that you could handle anything as long as you have me .
well , you have me , always .
and it &apos;s time you know the truth .
david clarke isn &apos;t just amanda &apos;s father .
he &apos;s your biological father as well .
no .
charlotte ...
later that evening ...
there would be another surprise .
emily thorne .
tyler .
excited for the party tomorrow night ?
you &apos;ll never get close enough to find out .
stay by your phone .
oh , and if you do anything rash , like , uh ,
cancel the engagement party or call the cops ,
you can kiss your friend here good @-@ bye .
amanda ?
on the surface ,
our engagement party looked like a great celebration .
where &apos;s daniel ?
he &apos;s walking the beach . we &apos;re having a thing .
but before the night was over ...
someone would be dead .
so what , you &apos;re just gonna ...
kill emily ?
no .
emily is gonna kill daniel .
or at least , that &apos;s how it will appear to the cops .
now why don &apos;t you ...
get dressed ?
i &apos;m not going to the party .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t get in your way .
i can &apos;t take that chance .
fire and ice ,
beginnings and endings ,
and the love between a man and a woman .
she &apos;s not worth it .
let &apos;s take a walk down to the shore .
shall we ?
and though we &apos;ve only known emily for a few short months ,
she already feels like a piece of the family puzzle
we never even knew was missing .
where the hell is my son ?
mom ! mom !
my brother !
daniel !
daniel !
daniel !
daniel . daniel , baby , please .
daniel , wake up , please .
baby , please !
it &apos;s tyler .
stand back , please .
mom ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i ...
don &apos;t say a word .
you should have heeded my warning .
what did you do ?
what happened on the beach ?
you won &apos;t get away with this , tyler .
sure i will , but emily won &apos;t .
stay back !
maybe you should call emily first .
she &apos;s a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing , you idiot .
please help me .
no !
daniel grayson ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of tyler barrol .
vengeance always comes at a price .
and those who deserve to suffer most ...
take your hands off my son !
aren &apos;t the only ones who pay .
tyler was shot three times .
once in the chest . twice in the back .
i didn &apos;t shoot tyler in the back .
how do you know ?
i thought you said you blacked out .
i saw someone in a dark hoodie
hiding behind the saw grass .
i don &apos;t know . it could &apos;ve been a hoodie .
it could &apos;ve been anything ,
like a guest from the party . it &apos;s hard to say .
when you and tyler struggled ,
where did he hit you ?
right here on the side of the head .
there &apos;s a hematoma on the back of your head .
that &apos;s a hard spot to reach if you &apos;re fighting face @-@ to @-@ face .
we can use it to float the theory
there was a third person on the beach
that knocked you out ,
set you up .
you &apos;re rich . who hates you ?
disgruntled investors , hostile competitors ...
amanda clarke .
ah . great .
where can we find her ?
i need you to think hard
about that person you saw on the beach .
you might remember things that you don &apos;t realize .
do you understand me ?
your brother &apos;s life may depend on it .
i should never have brought you so deep into this .
well , it &apos;s a little late to put that genie back in the infinity box .
anyway , we have more pressing problems .
the graysons are on a mission to find amanda .
until they do , they &apos;re gonna be looking for a fall guy
closer to home .
jack .
i can have your boat fixed and ready to go by nightfall .
running away is not gonna solve anything .
and i gotta find amanda before the graysons do .
yeah , how are you gonna do that ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
i want it clear ,
in my courtroom , justice has no price tag .
given the serious nature of this crime ,
i hereby deny bail ...
for daniel grayson ...
and order him to be remanded
to the maximum security correctional facility on rikers island .
i &apos;ve learned that in the pursuit of revenge ...
collateral damage cannot be avoided .
some truths must be buried in service of greater ones .
you gotta do something .
can you stand by as others bear the consequences
of what you have set in motion ?
