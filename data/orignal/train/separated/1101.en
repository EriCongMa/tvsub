Ali?
I've been tracking my missing RV.
Toby took it. He gave it to "A,"
but spencer already knew that.
I want to explain everything, but I just can't.
I know you're trying to protect Toby,
But I really wish you'd
think about the people you were hurting.
If we just tell them the truth,
"A" is the only chance I have
of finding out what really happened to my mom.
I think "A" gave you something real.
I've gotta find Dr. Palmer.
You tell her to stay away from that girl!
What girl?
The blonde girl!
The MRI confirmed a partial tear of the rotator cuff.
What about swimming?
There's a possibility of surgery.
You kissed me, and I pushed you off and then you left.
Everybody knows you and Mr. Fitz
weren't just scrabble buddies.
You cannot be the guy that helps me feel better anymore.
Don't you get that?
I'm your brother. I'm supposed to watch out for you.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Stop! That's my car! What are you doing?!
I found it in my mom's closet. I have to get rid of it.
Hold it!
I didn't kill anyone,
and I did nobring a gun into this house!
You have the right to an attorney...
She didn't do it!
Tell her that you didn't do it!
I love you.
I think that goes on the top shelf.
Really? Thanks for telling me that.
This time.
Here. Let me do it. I'll do it.
How's your shoulder?
Obviously still hurts.
Physical therapy isn't really helping.
Neither is tension.
I know. And I'm sorry.
Toby just isn't ready
to let you guys know what's going on yet.
I swear, we tried to follow Shana, but I just--
Can we stop talking about Shana for a minute?
We need to concentrate on Hanna.
Yeah, you're right.
Good. You two are talking.
Now if we could only get Hanna to eat.
We could order those mozzarella sticks from the brew.
She loves those.
The brew can't deliver
the one thing she really wants-- her mom.
This stuff is getting rock-hard.
No, don't throw it out.
Maybe Hanna's dad will eat it when he gets back.
Or we can use it to chisel Mrs. Marin out of jail.
I don't think that would go over so well at her arraignment.
What's going on with that, anyway? Has hanna said anything?
Only that her dad won't take her
to any of the meetings with the legal team.
Well, I'll see what I can find out.
Look, it's getting late. Why don't you two head home,
and I'll make sure that Hanna
gets something to eat before her dad gets back.
It's time to bust out the big guns
cake frosting and a spoon.
I'm good to stay.
Me too.
The only way we're getting Hanna through this is together.
So where is she, anyway?
Just promise me you won't do anything stupid, Caleb.
I would never do anything stupid, Hanna.
Never?
You let me into your life.
I think that was the smartest thing I've ever done.
You are not going to lose me, Hanna. I promise, okay?
As soon as I find something
to help get these murder charges off of her back,
I'll be right there beside you.
Coffee?
I should go.
The girls are downstairs.
Okay. I love you.
I love you too.
She's a tough girl.
Who you tellin'?
You ready to do this?
本地侦探斯莱
Let's get started.
Okay, so the intake session is not covered by insurance?
No, no, that's all right. We'll take the appointment.
All right, thanks.
You're not working today, are you?
No.
Why? What's up?
Someone at the station suggested prolotherapy for your shoulder.
Uh, prolotherapy?
Yeah, it's this series of injections
that stimulate the tissue around the injury
to promote healing.
How many injections?
Well, it's one a week for about two months.
Mom, I can
help pay for part of it if that helps.
No. No, no. The first session's gonna be a little tricky,
but insurance should cover most of the treatment.
And if it works the way it's supposed to,
then maybe you won't even have to have surgery.
Um, well, the physical therapy has been helping,
so if we don't have to spend more money, then...
Honey, look. Your father and I both agree
that this is something worth trying,
so we will find a way to cover the cost, not you.
I'm sorry, it's Hanna.
She's trying to get in touch with me.
I'm supposed to go over there this afternoon.
Look, Emily, I know you want to be there for her.
I feel so bad for Hanna.
But...right or wrong,
Ashley's been accused of murder..
And I really think that Hanna needs
to spend some time with her father right now.
Okay, just meet me at the station and we'll go from there.
And straight after school--
The clinic wants you there at 3:45. Okay?
At least he fixed the windshield.
I wonder how long it's gonna take him to fix the rest.
He should just sold the thing for scrap and started over.
Mike, Connor works at a coffee shop.
The only four wheels he can afford is a skateboard.
Wait, wait, wait. Now you feel sorry for this guy?
Sorry? No. No.
Part of me would have gladly taken a whack at that pi?ata.
Whoever did it knows Connor's a wuss.
That he always gets worked by offense,
hasn't fouled out of a game this season.
Things get aggressive, he backs down, every time.
You know, you never showed up at Emily's open mic.
Sad chicks in hipster glasses
playing the same three chords
and whining about their ex?
Yeah, no thanks.
So...
you just stayed home?
Really?
I'm not accusing, I'm just inquiring.
Hello? I play lacrosse.
It's a tiny little stick.
That car was smashed by a bat, a lead pipe,
maybe even a sledge hammer.
Okay, forget I asked.
I gotta get to class.
So your father decided to stay at the house with you?
Yeah. It'll just be easier that way.
He doesn't have to drive me all the way to school,
and we'll just stay at his place on the weekends.
Isabelle and Kate called.
They said nice things, so it shouldn't be too bad.
Sounds like it's all working out.
Um, Mrs. Hastings said I should pick something
for you to wear to court.
I was thinking the navy suit with the mandarin collar?
Yeah, and there's a--
a watch that your grandma Marin gave me a long time ago.
Be sure to grab that.
That's in the top tray in my jewelry box.
Mrs. Hastings said no jewelry.
Right.
Regina is such a tough old broad.
I was hoping some of that would rub off.
I could really use some "tough" right now.
Um...so the silent auction
for the school library renovation's coming up.
Yeah.
It's gonna be in this swank new restaurant in the city.
I don't know, I was thinking that
maybe I should get us ticket before it sells out.
Don't, sweetie.
I heard it might be black-tie this year.
I-I just need to get through the arraignment.
That's all I can think about right now.
Well, we can bid like crazy on a spa package
or a ski trip.
Hanna.
Promise me you'll be my date.
I can't promise you that.
Yes, you can.
Because you're going with me.
You sure that Spencer remembered that partial tail number right?
I feel like I've been at this for days.
She can quote entire passages of Dostoyevsky--
in two languages. Keep trying.
You really think that tracking down this plane is our best shot?
When I was working with Mona,
she thought red coat was pulling the strings.
Getting the girls to the lodge that night to burn the place down?
That's definitely an "A" move.
Hanna thinks that Alison is still alive.
Yeah, Spencer saw her too.
Everyone else just saw a blond in a red coat.
What about you?
Out cold.
For all I know, she's the one who clocked me.
You know, what I don't get is how did red coat
get from Thornhill all the way back to town to frame Hanna's mom?
When we find her, we'll ask.
Switch?
Gladly.
I was looking for a pen earlier,
and I found this.
Did you read that?
No. I just...
I thought-- red coat is "A," right?
We're looking for a blond.
It's not this.
What we're after, it's, uh, something else.
O-kay.
I'm starving. Do you, um, want anything from downstairs?
I'll take a sandwich or something.
Okay.
Wait.
We got a hit.
Same kind of plane as the one at Thornhill.
The flight plans are private.
The address of record is at Howell Acres Flight Center.
That's not far from here.
I'll drive.
No one's seen Shana since the Open Mic.
It's like she disappeared.
She can't just disappear. This isn't Hogworts.
There's only so many halls and classrooms.
Well, she sped out of Ravenswood in Jenna's Mustang.
Maybe she knows that Spencer and Toby saw her.
Maybe she doesn't want to answer any questions.
She'll pop up again.
Like it or not, she always does.
I could have brought that to you.
I was out earlier anyway.
I went to go visit my mom.
How is she?
Can I help you?
Emily. I can take it from here.
So I'll see you later?
Yeah, as soon as I can.
I'm surprised you showed up today.
Um, this is about the essay I didn't turn in yesterday, right?
No, this is about me checking in.
With all you're going through,
I can't imagine leaving the house, let alone coming here.
How are you doing?
Well, it's not that easy.
Everywhere I go people are staring at me all judgey-eyed,
like that lady in the book.
You know the one.
Well, there are a lot of books in the world, Hanna.
Like, really a lot.
No, the-the one with the judgey eyes
and--and the knitting, um...
Madame DeBarge.
Defarge?
Close enough.
Um, can I just get an I.O.U. for that essay?
What essay?
Thank you, Mr. Fitz.
Not forever, though, just until...
You've got a little less on your plate.
I meant thank you for being a really decent guy.
Miss Montgomery.
I was just coming to find you.
We have an issue.
We do?
Your brother Mike.
I just got a call from the police department.
A student's car was vandalized,
and it's possible your brother was involved.
Do you know anything about that?
No. I mean, I--
I was at the brew when it happened,
but I-I didn't see anything.
And your brother was--
I invited him to come to the show.
But he--he said that he wanted to video-chat with my mom,
so he stayed home.
And Connor's car was at the brew when it happened, so--
Is that all?
Not quite.
His medication-- is your brother still taking it?
Yes, of course. What does that have to do--
There were some problems last year, Aria.
I know that you're aware
of the ways in which your brother acted out.
A fist fight, some theft--
I'm just trying to get a look at the overall picture here.
Mr. Hackett, Mike's fine.
Thank you, Miss Montgomery. You're excused.
I'm a little busier than I thought I would be here today.
Are you sure you're okay doing this by yourself?
I guess so.
Is Lieutenant Tanner in today?
I saw her in passing this morning.
Here you go.
But you didn't talk to her?
No.
Why?
Uh, she came by the open mic.
I wanted to ask her if she liked it.
Okay, so I've already faxed over the intake paperwork.
Just show them the insurance card
when you check in with the receptionist.
I've got a key to sign in.
Hang on one second.
What's the case number?
W-4-6-8-0-9.
..4-6...
Here.
Okay, thanks.
Are the police still looking for other suspects in Wilden's murder?
Yes, Emily. The investigation is still ongoing.
Mom, can you print out the directions to the clinic?
I'm not quite sure how to get there.
Yeah.
I meant to do that earlier. I'm--I'm sorry.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Yeah. No, I understand.
Okay, well, we will-- we'll see you then.
Is your brother with you?
I think he has practice.
Well, I hope for his sake
this is all just a huge misunderstanding.
I was...
I just got off the phone with the school,
and one of his teammates is filing a police report,
and that kid's father is pressing to have him expelled.
Expelled?
Yes.
Over some kind of damage to a car?
It's that kid. Connor.
The one that you tutored last week.
Did you notice any tension between them?
I mean, is it-- is there any truth to this?
Aria...if you know something about this,
I need you to tell me.
I think this is happening because of me.
Connor kissed me, and I said that I wasn't interested,
so he...started this rumor at school.
What kind of rumor?
The kind that's really not worth repeating.
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Because I thought I'd handled it.
I set Connor and his friends straight. I--
Why would he say these things about you?
Look, apparently there's been some talk...
about me and Ezra.
Well, I-I guess that Connor figured
that since I'd... dated an older guy
that I would do just about anything with anybody.
Dad, I know what you're gonna say--
No, I'm not concerned with ezra fitz.
I am concerned with your brother
and making sure that he hasn't gotten himself into trouble.
And from the sound of it, this Connor kid is the one
who needs to be scrutinized and punished.
Where are you going?
I need to speak with your brother about this.
Okay. You are several steps beyond getting yourself out of gym.
How do you think I've been staying home all week?
I just don't want my mom to come home to no lights, no hot water,
and a weedy lawn.
Hanna, um, I need you to hear me.
Okay, quit making that face.
That's your "bad news" face.
My mom's not coming home anytime soon, is she?
I overheard my mom talking strategy with my dad.
And?
And from what it sounds like,
it'd probably be better if she had done it.
Your mom and Wilden had a really tense history.
Prove that he threatened her,
and they could go for voluntary manslaughter...
which is twenty years.
And if not...
...then it's first-degree murder.
And my mom spends the rest of her life in jail.
Or worse. Maybe.
That's just how bad it looks.
No. That's how bad "A" made it look.
Runway 31 left cleared for takeoff.
How can I help you guys?
Uh, yeah, my buddy here, he got stiffed on a kitchen remodel,
and the guy owns a plane,
we think he keeps it here.
Maybe you could help us see if he skipped town?
Anybody can look up a flight plan online.
Do you have the tail number?
We tried that and nothing came up.
Must be enrolled in the blocked aircraft registry.
Happens sometimes-- celebrities, corporations.
Private planes?
Sometimes.
But they still have to register a flight plan.
If his plane took off or landed here,
you'd have it on file, right?
Usually.
Think you could help us out?
驾驶员 约翰·史密斯
The last time the plane left this airfield
was the night of the fire.
Where's that destination code?
Looks like a regional airport in Delaware.
It's nowhere near Thornhill.
No passengers,
pilot's name is John Smith.
Sure it is. And I'm Pocahontas.
So, uh,
let's just say that this plane
maybe wanted to stop somewhere else.
Like Thornhill.
Yeah, let's just suppose.
They'd inform air traffic control. Or not. Depends.
This guy may not want people knowing where he went.
We got nothin'.
Different flight plan, no girl onboard.
Ah. So it's not about a kitchen-- it's about a girl.
To be honest, there was a lot of fog that night,
and Thornhill's barely a landing strip.
It would have been really hard to land there
under those conditions in the dark.
Sorry.
All right. Well, thank you for the information.
Hope you find your girl.
I wish I'd kept my mouth shut.
Hanna knows it doesn't look good.
The question is, can it get any worse?
Hanna's mom, Emily's parents, my mom, and now my brother?
You think "A" took a bat to Connor's car?
Please. This has "A" spray-painted all over it.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
To your doctor's appointment?
Emily, it's just a shot.
This is about who shot Wilden.
We still have time to find another murder suspect.
Any maybe save Hanna's mom?
Whatever it is, we're in.
Good--
'cause we're breaking in to Wilden's apartment.
Looks like his apartment's as messy as his police work.
The investigators probably turned this place over a few times.
I don't think this mess is all him.
They the ones who left his boxes on the floor too?
Lights stay off, remember.
And try and put things back where you found them
in case the police come back again.
Aria, gloves.
Here.
I'm not literally digging for clues.
I grabbed what I could find.
Look for letters, pictures--
anything that might connect Wilden to Shana and Jenna.
I still think they're gonna be
our best shot at saving Hanna's mom.
The bedroom's over here.
It's probably just a telemarketer.
Do we pick it up? Or--
It'll stop when it goes to voicemail.
See?
Keep looking.
I'm blitzed. I'm gonna head home and get some rest.
You can crash here if you want.
Is something bugging you?
The fog.
How'd he know it was foggy that night?
Maybe 'cause he's landed there before?
You know, and the pilot, that John Smith--
name never led anywhere either.
I tried to trace down the owner of the plane,
but it's in a trust.
Somebody's blowing a lot of smoke.
What do you make of this?
Uh, the "NW" is bigger-- "NorthWest."
Or "Nigel Wright."
And with the compass I kept thinking "sailor."
But it could mean "pilot."
Where did you get this?
I found it at the lodge that night.
I figured whoever started the fire probably used that,
but I couldn't do much else with it.
We were all there. If I would have turned it over to the cops,
there'd be questions-- lots.
So you think he started the fire?
Well, like you said,
somebody's blowing a lot of smoke.
I'm guessing it's our buddy Nigel.
Kitchen's clear. I got nothing.
Yeah, mail's pretty tame.
It's just junk, bills.
I feel weird touching his stuff even with gloves on.
Come up with anything?
Not a lot,
just some family photos, lots and lots of black socks
and his, uh... film collection.
Wilden's a film buff?
What, like classics?
Yeah, if you consider "Lord of the G-strings" a classic.
It's weird, though, there's no plants, no art,
there's not a lot of, like, knick-knacks or personal stuff.
I think what I found was pretty personal.
Spencer's right.
It's like he came here to eat, sleep and change his socks.
I think he did a little more than just change his socks.
And they weren't even under his socks--
they were just stacked on his nightstand like,
"Hmm. What do I want to watch tonight--
Jimmy Kimmel or boobs?"
Aria, focus.
We already knew that Wilden was a creep, okay?
And what are we missing?
Did you check that box?
I didn't even see that.
Might be a gift. That's pretty personal.
This is from that fancy Steak Company
my dad always gets from my uncle for his birthday.
Ohh! God, that's ripe!
I don't see a note or anything.
Oh, my God, it's making my eyes water.
I hate to say this, but I'm really grateful
for these hideous gloves right now.
"Can't wait to see you at our little barbecue.
Kisses, 'A.'"
Aria.
Are you here to see Mr. Hackett?
No. No, I'm here for Mike.
He's in there with my dad
and...Connor and Connor's dad.
I saw the car. Mike couldn't have done that.
They're saying that he did.
Mike's in there getting railroaded,
and Hackett's just letting it happen.
They're actually filing a police report. If Mike gets expelled--
That's not gonna happen-- not if he didn't do it.
Aria, I get it-- what you said.
I can't be the one to swoop in and comfort you.
But it kills me...
I know.
Anyway, Hackett's saying that Mike's crazy
and that he's off his meds.
I thought he was gonna ask me
to count the pills in his prescription bottle.
Did he ask you that? Directly?
Aria, do you know who really did this?
Ezra.
Byron.
Um, Aria's been telling me what's been going on.
If there's anything that I can do...
No, thanks. I appreciate that offer.
Aria, why don't you go back home and wait.
We'll see you back there.
You come see me in my office when you're done.
She doesn't find that key. We're gonna have a problem.
Did you lose something?
I don't smoke.
A lighter might come in handy for other things.
Wow, he was such a chatterbox yesterday.
I wonder what happened.
Guys, listen...
You're the pilot,
right? John Smith?
Hey, you filed that flight plan to Delaware as cover,
landed at Thornhill in the fog,
delivered a blond girl in a red coat,
and then you flew her out of there.
Who is she, Nigel?
I don't know anything about a fire. I wasn't there.
Just--I got paid to fake a flight plan.
Okay? And spin a little story
if someone came asking. That's all.
By who?
Was it her? The blond?
I'll give you your money back, okay? I just got greedy.
We are gonna need a name.
I could lose my job! I broke the law!
Just...
Her name was--
I don't know. Drake, Cece, I think.
Just take the money and drop it, all right?
Let him go!
That guy was never gonna tell us the whole story anyway.
But maybe this will.
Yes, of course.
I understand.
Mr. Hackett, may I have a word?
Can't it wait? I'm rather in the middle of something.
It's actually about this.
Please. It will only take a moment.
Officer, may I call you back?
Yes. I will take care.
Thank you.
We're very close to a solution here.
Unless you've got something compelling to add--
Did anyone actually witness this happening?
Can anyone besides Connor say for certain that Mike was at fault?
The school has a zero tolerance policy toward violence.
Attacking another person or their property...
Allegedly.
I'm trying to see that
he doesn't get charges pressed against him.
In exchange, there's gonna have to be some kind of punishment.
The other family won't compromise.
I don't want the boy to suffer unduly.
It's a good thing his medical history hasn't come up.
I'd hate to see Mike labeled as mentally unstable
and a vandal.
Well, you don't think that's pertinent information to consider?
Maybe... if you hadn't asked his sister.
I can only imagine the can of worms that-- that would open up
if the parent found out.
Let me stop you right there, Ezra.
Now, I can see where I might have made an error in judgment.
But I wonder whether
your very personal bias where the Montgomery family is concerned
isn't an error in yours.
Okay, we're through his password.
Look at all those calls to the same number in New York.
And look at the last one.
That was right after we left the airfield.
So you think that this is
where Cece Drake went when she left town?
I can get into it and see what I can find out.
But why would she want to ruin Ashley Marin?
Or hurt Hanna?
Or the rest of you, for that matter.
Could she have helped Wilden set that fire?
Or was Wilden helping her?
She said she was leaving town because she was afraid of Wilden.
So maybe the truth is that they set the fire,
she killed Wilden.
And this set-up is her covering her own tracks.
Can you think of a reason to believe she's not "A"?
Toby,
Cece visited Mona when she was in Radley.
Can you give us a minute?
Yeah, just don't start making out or anything.
Believe me, I missed him while you two were playing hardy boys,
but now is not the time.
How long ago did you find out about Cece going to visit Radley?
Right before I left there.
I found her visitor's pass
in Mona's stash.
Dr. Palmer said to watch out for the blond girl.
Any chance that he meant Cece?
You said he was in and out,
but maybe he wasn't as out as you thought.
Cece could have gotten her hands on your mother's records.
We won't know for sure until we find her.
Excuse me?
The video-chatting with mom?
Come on. They could have checked that.
We got sausage king on the way home.
That sounds like a celebration.
W-what happened?
Actually, Mr. Fitz happened.
What do you mean?
He talked to Hackett, and the next thing I know,
Hackett's telling Connor and his dad
that if the police have no prints or witnesses,
He's got no reason to expel me.
Now I kinda wish I done it.
Or done something.
Come on, Mike. That's not you.
Maybe it should be.
If anything like this happens to you again,
I want to be ready.
Now come eat.
Emily?
What are you up to?
Just doing some homework.
The clinic called.
You rescheduled your appointment?
I had something to do. For Hanna.
I know your friend is in a terrible situation,
but this is just as important.
If you ever want to be able to swim again--
I do!
Then take it seriously!
I'm gonna bring you to the appointment myself tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Mom, okay?
Do you want me to meet you at work again tomorrow?
No. I won't be at work.
I was suspended today.
Just... finish your homework.
I gotta call your dad.
Twice in one day.
I was just leaving a thank you note.
Um, email felt a little impersonal.
It all feels impersonal lately.
I'm really glad you swooped.
You know there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, right?
I gotta go.
Self-defense?
Mom, you have to plead guilty and say that's what it was.
Self-defense. There's no other way.
You know I didn't do this.
I know.
Then why?!
If the choice is between losing you for twenty years
and losing you forever,
I'll take the twenty years.
And I know you will too
if it means that someday we'll be together again.
No, Hanna, I won't!
Not when we both know--
Mom, look where we are.
We know the truth. We know you were set up.
But nobody else is buying it.
Listen to me, Hanna.
I can accept responsibility for the choices I made
that put Darren Wilden in our way.
But I will not admit to a murder I didn't commit!
He doesn't get to die
and leave me looking like a criminal.
Caleb-- that's the guy with the long hair?--
I think he's the one that took my phone.
It's Lady Grey tea, right?
I'm sorry. I screwed up.
Careful, babe. It's hot.
Yeah. Without pay.
I-I don't know how long.
I mean, it's either gonna be until they find that key,
or decide that I'm at fault.
Wayne, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I mean, should I be looking for something else?
No.
No, honey.
Look, you and I both know
that we can't afford for me not to be working.
Yeah.
N-no. No, no. I--
I don't know.
You know what? I suppose we could just use
the emergency credit card in the short term.
Right?
Oh, my.
Mom! Mom, are you okay?!
Yeah.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
