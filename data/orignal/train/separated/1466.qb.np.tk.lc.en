haley , hurry up ! you are gonna be late .
alex , what are you doing ?
i need to document haley &apos;s first standard chain gang .
it &apos;s not a chain gang .
it &apos;s community service . and leave her a lone .
she feels bad enough as it is .
okay , i &apos;m torn . on one hand , i &apos;m like ,
&quot; ugh , i have to pick up garbage all day . &quot;
and on the other hand , i &apos;m like ,
&quot; look at me in orange . &quot;
aw , that &apos;s cute . send that to me .
haley had a little run @-@ in with the law in college .
she was arrested for assaulting a police officer .
accidentally . i fell on him .
while evading arrest for underage drinking .
that was on purpose .
they were very lenient with her .
she only has to do community service .
because i do not have any priors .
taking a little too much pride in that , sweetheart .
things can get pretty rough out there .
i couldn &apos;t get my hands on any cigarettes .
but i did make you a shiv out of an old knife .
you don &apos;t make a shiv out of a knife .
yeah , you make a shiv out of a rusty spoon or a shard of glass .
or a human femur .
exactly . be creative .
it &apos;s really sweet of you , luke ,
but there &apos;s just gonna be a bunch of drunk drivers
and vandalizers who were stupid enough to get caught .
or stupid enough to use the word &quot; vandalizers . &quot;
it &apos;s vandals .
i &apos;m so alone .
they &apos;re gonna eat you alive , suburbia .
mitchell , we &apos;re back .
you are not going to believe this .
cam , do you remember why i didn &apos;t want you
to swap out the handles on lily &apos;s dresser ?
because you lack a designer &apos;s eye and fear change ?
no . because i was afraid two weeks would go by ,
and we &apos;d still be using a spatula
to get at lily &apos;s clothes .
okay , well , we have bigger issues .
guess what they are cutting down at the park today ?
a tree ?
yes . how did you know that ?
i played a hunch .
not just any tree , tree @-@ ona elmsly .
oh , no . that &apos;s terrible . that &apos;s our picnic tree .
it &apos;s a nightmare .
well , someone &apos;s picked up her daddy &apos;s gift for hyperbole .
they are literally chainsawing paradise
to put up a parking lot .
oh , it &apos;s too bad .
we have to do something .
well , if we knew earlier , we could .
i blame myself . i &apos;ve taken on too much .
what exactly have you taken on ?
are you kidding me ? teaching music ?
this dresser handle project ? my role in the musical ?
oh , that .
you know what ? i don &apos;t like your tone .
the understudy &apos;s the most challenging role in any production .
you have to be ready at a moment &apos;s notice
to go on and face a disappointed audience
who was there to see kenny van heffington .
our insurance guy ?
he &apos;s breathtaking .
really ?
yeah , i hate him .
anyway , what was i talking about ?
putting new handles on the dresser .
right . the tree . i have to do something .
i can &apos;t live like this .
manny , while we &apos;re young !
he doesn &apos;t want to go .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s taking so long with the primping .
a boy his age should do exactly zero primping .
you ready ?
not in the least .
that &apos;s the spirit .
this kid in my class , doug brooks ,
has a sports @-@ themed birthday party every year .
all boys . all sports . all day .
he calls it the doug @-@ lympics ,
which might make sense if he did it every four years ,
or if his name was al .
let &apos;s just say nothing about it works .
manny , it &apos;s a beautiful day outside .
go on . enjoy your dougy @-@ lympics .
you don &apos;t have to win a medal . just have fun .
doug finishes with the most medals no matter what .
plus i think he only invites me
because he likes to match skin color to nation .
i know that &apos;s why alan yan gets invited .
okay , we get it . sports isn &apos;t your thing .
but you gotta step out of your comfort zone sometime .
and for god sake ,
change out of those wingtips .
you &apos;re a kid . you &apos;re not nixon on the beach .
fine . i &apos;ll put on my sporty shoes .
where are they ?
they &apos;re still in the box .
and don &apos;t forget to take out the paper
before you put them on , okay ?
and they &apos;re called sneakers .
hello , hello !
hey , gloria . so , ready to go ?
where ?
thought we were doing a costco run .
oh , i see what this is .
you called claire to babysit the stupid pregnant lady !
you &apos;re the one who called her .
i did ?
i called claire .
gloria needs watching .
she &apos;s got a serious case of pregnancy brain .
last week , i found a bar of soap in the fridge
and a stick of butter in the shower .
i walked around all day smelling like a bucket of popcorn .
better than the toast i ate .
yet you ate the second piece .
jay ! bye @-@ bye ! we &apos;re leaving !
seriously ? i &apos;m right here .
duck ! duck ! come on and hit him , you little freak !
talk about a big left hook .
god , i love you .
phil in the blank !
bill of rights !
jerry @-@ atric !
alan &apos;s dad !
hey , guys . luke , you getting in there ?
of course .
look , i &apos;m mexico . again .
does anybody care that i &apos;m not from mexico ?
you keep saying that ,
but we &apos;ve never seen a birth certificate .
all right , look , i &apos;ll pick you up at 5 : 00 .
knock yourself out .
or better still , knock someone else out .
jay , where you headed ?
why don &apos;t you stick around and grab a beer with the dads ?
oh , i don &apos;t really know those guys .
i think i &apos;ll just swing by the club , hit a few balls .
well , come here . let me introduce you around .
hey , guys ,
this is jay , my father @-@ in @-@ law . manny &apos;s stepdad .
hey , what &apos;s up , jay @-@ lo ?
okay , guys , i &apos;ll see you later .
what &apos;s the matter , jay ?
afraid to step outside your comfort zone ?
i will send you back to mexico .
i didn &apos;t really call you , did i ?
no , my dad did . but i thought you knew .
ugh . i want to be so mad at him ,
but he &apos;s right .
i have two brains in my body ,
but i &apos;ve never been so dumb .
it happens . i get it .
you have another human being inside of you ,
competing for resources .
look , when i was pregnant with alex ,
i could barely remember my name .
same with haley and luke ?
mm , not so much .
they kind of just hung out in there , let me do my thing .
thank you for understanding .
i &apos;m glad that you came .
it will help me not to forget stuff .
i &apos;m glad i can help out . i--
why didn &apos;t you stop first ? !
where &apos;s daddy ?
i don &apos;t know , sweetie .
he said to meet him by tree @-@ ona .
mitchell ! lily !
where is he ?
up here ! look up here !
cam , what are you doing up there ?
i came down to say good bye to the tree ,
give it one final hug ,
and before i knew it , i was up here .
when you say &quot; one final hug ... &quot;
if i &apos;m occupying the tree , they can &apos;t cut it down .
i googled it . it &apos;s a thing .
okay , lily , see , this is a nightmare .
tell me about it .
you know what ? you &apos;re a list @-@ maker , a planner .
i &apos;m a doer and an action taker !
sean penn would play me in a movie about this ,
or anne hathaway , if they wanted a female @-@ driven vehicle .
and who would play your long @-@ suffering partner ?
julianne moore , either way .
i would totally see that . i would .
hey ! my supervisor wants to know
if you have a history of mental illness .
no , sir , i do not .
all right , cam , let &apos;s hear . what &apos;s the plan ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m sort of making it up as i go .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
yes . i &apos;ve never been more sure about anything in my life .
we need to teach our daughter the value of taking a stand ,
no matter the sacrifice !
hello ?
done . i &apos;ll be right there .
mitchell , you need to get up here . i have to go .
excuse me ?
that was my theater troupe . an actor &apos;s sick .
i have to go and do the matinee .
what happened to showing lily the value of taking a stand ?
it &apos;s the lead .
it &apos;s also important to show her the value
of honoring one &apos;s commitments .
and in this case , my commitment preceded my stand !
this is so you , cam .
you start something , and then you expect me to finish it .
so you &apos;re not coming up here ?
no ! no , i &apos;m not . come on .
mitchell ?
where were we the first day lily rolled over ?
under this tree .
where is home base when we play hide @-@ and @-@ go @-@ seek ?
under this tree .
and where did we take shelter
during that dangerous lightning storm ?
wasn &apos;t a good idea , but it was under this tree .
daddy , you &apos;ve got to save the tree !
yeah , daddy , you have to save the tree !
okay , okay .
but you get back here the second you are done .
well , i can &apos;t very well turn away fans that come backstage .
the second !
last summer , my sister took a totally humiliating photo of me .
haley , that &apos;s not funny !
then she posted it to facebook
and refused to take it down .
it got 873 likes .
meanwhile , there &apos;s not one embarrassing photo of haley .
even her mug shots were cute .
today , i get my revenge .
one photo of haley , dirty , sweaty ,
picking up trash like a criminal .
it &apos;ll be my finest moment .
in a few years , i hope to have some more friends
and not have time for this kind of stuff .
okay . hey .
where did you go ?
to get a sweatshirt .
we &apos;ve been standing in the frozen food aisle for half an hour .
i need something frozen .
right . what ?
i don &apos;t know . i just wrote the word &quot; frozen . &quot;
okay . uh , let &apos;s think .
peas . ice cream . pizza . waffles .
wait a minute .
it says &quot; dozen . &quot; i need the eggs !
ah , the eggs . okay .
ay , no , on the other side .
oh , god . i @-@ i &apos;ll get the carts .
so that &apos;s ... oh , sorry .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s me . that &apos;s me . i got it .
come on , guys ! you &apos;re killing us !
where the heck is mexico ?
good news , gentlemen ! i found another rope .
if we double @-@ dutch , everyone wins .
okay , hold still ...
and wait for it ...
this is what you &apos;d look like fat and bald .
on my phone , that app &apos;s called a camera .
bill , don &apos;t do that to yourself .
let me tell you something . ellen is one lucky woman .
why is that funny ?
because she &apos;s married to jerry .
jay , you got any good apps ?
i don &apos;t know . i got call waiting . is that an app ?
you guys laugh a lot , huh ?
jay &apos;s a little technologically challenged .
from a guy who can &apos;t drive a stick .
what ?
you can &apos;t ?
well ... he called me to rescue him one time .
he got stuck on a hill . he was afraid to let go of the clutch .
by the time i got there ,
traffic &apos;s backed up half a mile ,
everybody &apos;s yelling at him . he &apos;s in tears .
not tears . maybe sweat .
yeah , sweatin &apos; out your eyes .
i had about ten pretty bad pictures of haley .
i could have quit right there ,
but i &apos;m a perfectionist .
i thought ,
&quot; i could do better . she could look worse . &quot;
oh , my god .
all right , pal .
come down from the tree .
sorry , can &apos;t do that .
come down before we pull you down .
w--hey . ease up .
what &apos;s the problem ?
look , i don &apos;t want to be up here .
you know ? but this is my daughter &apos;s favorite tree .
and my partner-- he &apos;s all up in arms
about them cutting it down , so ...
well , if your partner &apos;s so worked up , why isn &apos;t he here ?
oh , well , that &apos;s a very good question .
it &apos;s because he starts things , and he doesn &apos;t finish them ,
so then i have to .
just like my wife .
you know , my therapist would say we &apos;re &quot; enabling &quot; them .
you and your therapist .
i wouldn &apos;t have to see him if you hadn &apos;t shot that guy .
aw , that again ?
look , let &apos;s just spray him with the fire hose .
you &apos;re not helping , terry .
it &apos;s not your fight .
so why don &apos;t you do us a favor ,
and come on down ?
because he &apos;s right , all right ?
that &apos;s the frustrating part .
i @-@ i &apos;ve been sitting up here these past few hours ,
and ... this tree is beautiful , okay ?
and i @-@ i can hear the squirrels dancing through the branches ,
you know , chasing each other ,
no idea what &apos;s about to happen .
you know , this isn &apos;t just a tree .
this is a home .
yeah , to , like , a hundred rats .
they &apos;re all over this thing .
well , that changes nothing .
i will wait you guys out all night if i have to .
cam , you got 20 minutes ,
and i &apos;m out of this tree .
terry , you wanna get ready with that hose ?
so alex comes home from school the other day ,
and she said the teacher didn &apos;t know what she was talking about ,
when in reality , i don &apos;t think that--
you almost just cut my head off .
you gotta focus .
i am sorry . after all that , i forgot the eggs !
excuse me .
yeah , hang on one second .
listen , this is not just your pregnancy .
you are purposely turning your brain off .
you have to at least try to pay attention .
ma &apos;am ?
yeah .
do you have a receipt for that sweatshirt ?
oh , shoot .
i &apos;m gonna need you to come back into the store .
oh , no . no , it &apos;s--i forgot i was wearing it .
it &apos;s no big deal . here .
ma &apos;am . the store .
are you kidding me ?
i didn &apos;t try to steal a sweatshirt !
sir , i &apos;m a mom .
gloria , help me out .
listen , mr. policeman ,
if we wanted to steal it ,
you wouldn &apos;t even know that it was gone !
yeah , okay . that &apos;s not helping .
oh , my god ! a gold bracelet !
hey , can we keep what we find ?
unbelievable .
really ?
gentlemen , you wanna know about
the real ultimate frisbee ?
walk with one balanced on your head for 50 meters .
it is a measure of poise , balance , and posture .
let &apos;s just whip the frisbees at each other as hard as we can
and see who quits first .
frisbee smash .
awesome ! let &apos;s go !
oh , my god , i &apos;m sisyphus .
死后入地狱被罚做永无休止的推巨石苦工 &#93;
a big one !
so he &apos;s out in our yard and he &apos;s got a boombox ...
what &apos;s the name of that movie with the boombox ?
oh , &quot; say anything . &quot;
with john mahoney .
so anyway , he &apos;s out there ,
and he &apos;s begging claire for forgiveness .
she &apos;s still mad at him . she won &apos;t have any of it .
so he turns it up full @-@ blast ,
and it &apos;s olivia newton @-@ john .
and he starts singing , &quot; let &apos;s get phil @-@ sical &quot; !
it was an inside joke .
well , not anymore !
okay , enough with the funny phil stories .
no , but i haven &apos;t even gotten to the best part yet .
so he &apos;s doing his little dance , and i can &apos;t take it anymore ,
so i nail him with the sprinklers !
yep , and you also shorted out my boombox ,
which you said you &apos;d replace and you never did .
i never said that !
yes , you did . you still owe me one boombox ,
12 &quot; d &quot; batteries ,
and an olivia newton @-@ john cassingle .
okay , uh ...
why don &apos;t we settle it in the ring ?
we get in there ,
and if you beat me , i &apos;ll buy you any boombox you want .
if i beat you ,
then you &apos;ve gotta do your little dance for everyone .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s get phil @-@ sical .
i wasn &apos;t worried . i &apos;d boxed in the navy .
and it was phil .
and here &apos;s something i thought i &apos;d never say--
i &apos;d rather box my daughter &apos;s husband than my son &apos;s .
i may have been holding on to a tiny bit of anger towards jay .
i scooped ice cream all summer for that boombox !
excuse me . pardon me . we &apos;re here !
we came as fast as we could !
you couldn &apos;t change ?
you said come right away !
excuse me , ladies and gentlemen !
oakwood rep &apos;s production of &quot; cats &quot; !
make sure you catch it this week .
word on the street is the understudy steals the show !
mitchell , i get two more shows !
kenny van heffington &apos;s toenail is infected !
just get up here , all right ?
the crew has to leave at dark ,
so you have until then .
easy peasy .
sweetie , tell daddy what you thought of my performance .
transcendent .
oh , jeez .
is this sap ?
why would i buy hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise
and then steal a $ 20 sweatshirt ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe you do it for the thrill .
i know your type .
you &apos;re a bored housewife , drives a minivan ,
husband spends a little too much time online .
got a couple of kids , a college degree you don &apos;t use .
you could not be more wrong .
yes . she has three kids .
okay , no . no , no .
no , no . no , that &apos;s not helping .
look , as i said before , it was an accident .
heard it a thousand times .
grandmothers , businessmen , honor students--
they all say the same thing--
&quot; it was an accident .
i don &apos;t know how that clock radio
got in my pants . &quot;
oh , for god sake ! i don &apos;t feel well .
let us go .
yeah , right .
is that even a baby ?
&apos;cause from here , it looks like a turkey .
i need you to sign this , admitting your guilt ,
and promising you &apos;ll never return to this store .
i &apos;m not signing that .
okay , great .
then i &apos;m gonna call the police and i &apos;ll be forced to--
what was that ?
my water broke !
i &apos;m having the baby !
sorry about that . i went a little nuts there .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i do .
i was ragging on you in front of your friends .
oh , yeah .
sorry about that .
i couldn &apos;t think of anything else to say .
why not ?
i got 20 , 25 years on those guys .
we got nothing in common .
it &apos;s only gonna get worse .
i mean , what &apos;s it gonna be like with the new kid in ten years ?
oh , my goodness .
you &apos;re insecure and vulnerable .
this is the cutest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
shut up .
who &apos;s a shy bunny ?
you wanna go one more round , without the gloves ?
i &apos;m just playing around , jay .
i don &apos;t care how old you are .
i could sit and talk to you all day .
those guys really liked you , too .
i don &apos;t care about that .
did they ?
even jerry ?
yes .
well , maybe you &apos;re right .
i mean , manny didn &apos;t want to come , and look at him .
looks like he &apos;s having a great time .
so then luke &apos;s dad grabs the taser from me ,
and he was like , &quot; uhh ! uhh ! &quot;
no . no !
that &apos;s not how it happened .
aah ! ay ! ay ! it hurts !
hang in there ! hang in there !
get you to the hospital as soon as i can !
i just want to apologize ...
one more time on behalf of the store
for any stress that i might have caused you .
here , you can keep the sweatshirt as a gift .
and congratulations on this baby ,
which is clearly not a turkey . that was--
go away now !
yeah .
okay . go on . go on . get in . keep going .
what hospital are we going to ?
no ! no hospital !
no hospital . wow .
you &apos;re one of those , huh ?
okay , please don &apos;t have it in the pool , though .
&apos;cause we swim in there .
i &apos;m not having the baby , claire .
i was just faking it .
what ?
not bad for someone with pregnancy brain , huh ?
okay , that &apos;s good . that was very good .
good thinking , gloria .
i &apos;m sorry . i just couldn &apos;t sit there
and watch you suffer
just because you had turned your brain off .
okay , i deserved that .
oh , no . oh , no , no , no , no .
i just blew through a red light . damn .
you think you can keep the pregnancy thing up
for a little while longer ?
i feel the head !
feel it ! feel it !
save it ! save it for the cop !
save it .
all right , guys , that &apos;s it . pack it up !
you win for today . see you on monday .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
so i &apos;ll go to city hall on monday
and see what i can do ,
but ... you did it , cam !
no , we did it .
i had to run away , and you stepped in ,
and like an understudy , you gave a brilliant performance .
yeah , but you &apos;re the star .
oh , well ...
can we stop doing this and go home ?
yes , lily , but i want you to remember this moment--
the day your daddies made you proud .
turn her away , mitchell ! turn her away !
alex , what are you doing here ?
learning a valuable lesson about karma
and how wrong it is to take pleasure
in people &apos;s embarrassment .
wow . i don &apos;t know what any of that means ,
but you look like hell .
say &quot; geek . &quot;
no !
he &apos;s a vandalizer !
593 likes , and counting .
who does he belong to ?
he &apos;s mine .
it was a great ending to an amazing day .
look , i even ... made the paper .
&quot; bizarre protest saves park tree . &quot;
oh , look what it says .
&quot; this production of &apos; cats &apos; should be put to sleep . &quot;
don &apos;t read that .
don &apos;t ...
oh , hey , gloria .
listen , i called jay about borrowing a drill
for my dresser handles .
i got it right here , cam !
oh , jeez . what &apos;s with the getup ?
ay , good . you see that , too ?
stella , stop .
ay , shh , shh , shh . sorry , cam .
oh , no , don &apos;t be . i take it as a compliment .
