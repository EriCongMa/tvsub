ah , &quot; the breakfast club &quot; --
truly the ultimate teen movie of the &apos; 80s .
every high @-@ school clique was represented --
the geeks , the jocks ,
the loners , the molly ringwalds .
it showed us that if we &apos;d sit and talk in a circle of trust ,
we could all be friends .
of course , that didn &apos;t apply to me .
i was a freshman .
high school meant i had a clean slate .
the movie inspired me to reinvent myself .
i am the coolest freshman alive .
i wasn &apos;t .
but , damn it , judd nelson sure taught me how to be .
what the hell is this ?
why aren &apos;t you moving ?
stop it !
start moving your body !
and lucky for me , i had a big older bro and sis
who would help me out .
why do you have so many outfits on ?
yeah , you look like a hobo who lives in a dumpster
behind a burlington coat factory .
it &apos;s my new look .
i &apos;m locking in who i &apos;m gonna be for the next four years .
did you cut the fingers off of my lace madonna gloves ?
now they &apos;re fingerless tough @-@ guy gloves ...
with some lace .
okay , here &apos;s how this year &apos;s gonna work .
during school hours , you will not walk , talk ,
or breathe anywhere near us .
well , what if i need you guys ?
you definitely will , but we won &apos;t be there .
thing is , i &apos;m a senior now ,
so my focus will be on being super popular
and making terrible mistakes
that will greatly affect my future .
and as one of the school &apos;s top jocks ,
i &apos;ll be knocking the books out of your hands .
you &apos;re not the school &apos;s top anything !
this is madness !
is it ?
this year , i &apos;m joining the varsity wrestling ,
basketball , and cross @-@ country .
cross @-@ country ? since when can you run far or fast ?
oh , i run . i run plenty .
yeah , your weird barry run .
are you crazy ? i don &apos;t run like that .
i run like this .
yeah , it &apos;s probably best
that both of you stay away from me this year .
schmoopaloos , exciting news !
we need to have a little talk .
stop running . eyes on me .
remember how i told you all summer
i was taking a painting class
to help give my life a sense of purpose ?
no .
who paints what ?
you people don &apos;t listen to a word i say .
and i would be deeply hurt if it wasn &apos;t all a total lie .
i was taking a course for this .
it &apos;s my teaching certificate .
for what ?
for substitute teaching !
for where ?
high school !
for which high school ?
yours !
this isn &apos;t happening !
that &apos;s right . you &apos;re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of mama .
oh , balls !
i feel anger in my body !
see , that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the barry run .
it was september 3 , 1980 @-@ something ,
the night before school started ,
and our worst nightmare had become reality .
question -- what does this sweater say to you ?
school ?
that &apos;s exactly what i was going for .
look at you . a real teacher .
while this might have begun as a way
for me to inappropriately track my children &apos;s every move ,
it &apos;s given me a renewed sense of purpose .
i &apos;m thrilled .
you &apos;re always marching down there to make trouble anyhow .
might as well get some money for it .
also , you &apos;re supporting the most important woman in your life .
sure ! why not ?
hey ! what do you think ?
how does professor goldberg look ?
mom , you &apos;re not a professor .
well , then why do i have a phd in nose boops ?
see you in the halls , delicious pupils .
excuse us , father .
we hate to interrupt your evening ,
but we would like to borrow a brief moment
of your valuable personal time .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
you morons always come in screaming when you want something .
it &apos;s true . this energy is very unnerving .
shouting at you has produced poor results in the past ,
and at this moment , our lives are at stake .
which is why we came to you as calm , mature , young adults
to talk this out rationally .
even barry ? seems unlikely .
agreed .
since you &apos;re asking so politely ,
i &apos;ll wait before i say no .
we need to discuss mom &apos;s new position at william penn academy .
as you know , children need healthy walls
between their academic and home lives .
and , if i may add ,
mom is a monster that must be stopped !
no , barry !
you promised !
sorry ! sorry .
well , the answer &apos;s no .
have a good school year .
so , may i ?
go to town .
do your thing .
w @-@ what &apos;s going on here ?
you make mom quit or i will knock everything over you love ,
starting with these thin books !
what are you doing ? you &apos;re scaring the dog !
i ... am throwing ... candies in anger !
went too hot too fast . here .
i need ... like five hours ... to recharge my anger .
hello , and welcome , william penn academy .
thrilled to be back for what &apos;s shaping up to be
the most exciting school year with --
oh , crap ! she &apos;s already here !
just get to class !
my god , lady .
it &apos;s the first minute of the school year .
minute .
oh , earl .
i &apos;m not here to beat you into submission .
i &apos;m here to teach .
i &apos;m sorry . teach ?
yes . i got certified over the summer .
i &apos;m on your list of subs .
i am unaware of any such list .
here it is . see ?
there &apos;s my name right there .
i put it there myself . right at the top .
see it ?
see it ?
yeah .
see ?
i see .
see ?
i see it .
see ?
i see it , damn it !
so , where do you need me , boss ?
thing is , it is the first day of school
and all of my teachers are here and healthy .
so , i will give you a call as soon as ...
never .
i get the sense you don &apos;t want me here , earl .
oh , good !
thanks for reading all the obvious social cues .
you &apos;re not seeing the big picture , boss .
you &apos;re gonna need me one day , and you know where i &apos;ll be ?
please don &apos;t say here .
here . waiting .
like a panther .
a panther who teaches .
please don &apos;t wait like a teaching panther .
oh , i &apos;ll wait but good
&apos;cause you never know when one of your teachers
might get sick or have a nasty accident .
please don &apos;t hurt anybody .
see you soon .
as my mom was anxious to get teaching ,
i was about to teach my best friends
a lesson in cool .
welcome back , gentlemen .
what &apos;s with all the jackets ?
yeah , man . denim on flannel on tweed ?
that looks swampy .
so swampy .
but that &apos;s the price of being a badass .
wait . what &apos;s with your jacket ?
clean slate , bro .
this year , i &apos;m reinventing myself
as a badass greaser like fonzie .
already got the hair .
fonzie doesn &apos;t have a bowl cut .
and why are you in so much purple ?
i &apos;m reinventing myself to be a sexy badass like prince .
we can &apos;t all reinvent ourselves as badasses .
this is not good .
no one knows us here ! we can be anything we want !
hey , look . it &apos;s the jacket gang .
it &apos;s true ! they &apos;re all wearing jackets !
it &apos;s what defines them .
later , jacket jerks .
oh , no .
we &apos;ve been mislabeled .
take &apos; em off ! take &apos; em off !
it &apos;s too late . we can &apos;t be seen together till next semester .
enjoy the holidays !
erica ! i need your help .
no , no , no ! we had an agreement !
dude , you &apos;re super sweaty .
i committed to this look before i checked the weather .
please . i need help .
i &apos;m a senior .
i don &apos;t have time for any drama , especially yours .
speaking of drama , what about geoff schwartz ?
who cares about that tool ?
i mean , sure , he loved me his whole life
and i foolishly blew him off .
but now geoff &apos;s with evy , which is great ,
&apos;cause i can focus on my year of awesome
and really get out there .
crap . here they come .
close the door . close the metal door .
i -- slam it in my face . i can take it .
please tell me they &apos;re gone .
make a hole , people !
peak physical champions coming through .
check this out , fellas .
what are you doing , man ?
that &apos;s not how you welcome somebody to our school .
but we &apos;re jocks .
we &apos;re student athletes , bro . leaders on and off the field .
have a good year , little man .
wait up ! i love nerds ! just --
i &apos;ll punch someone else . just tell me who to punch .
even though we were still trying to find our place at school ,
our mom was feeling right at home .
oh , the teachers &apos; lounge !
oh ! so beautiful .
i &apos;m home .
well , well , well . the rumors are true .
hello , andre .
i &apos;ve been waiting for this moment a long , long time .
thank you so much . i &apos;ve worked really hard to get here .
not to support you . to destroy you !
what ? !
well , maybe not destroy , but to be cold and distant .
doesn &apos;t really come naturally to me .
i &apos;m really a people person . everybody says so .
but after all the times you made the teachers &apos; lives hell ,
did you really think that we were gonna accept you as one of us ?
it wasn &apos;t personal .
i was just doing my job as mama bear .
well , the bear &apos;s got no claws now .
that &apos;s right ! we got the claws !
let me do the talking , bruce .
i &apos;m afraid only real teachers
are welcome in the teachers &apos; lounge .
and you &apos;re not one of us .
so , where am i supposed to eat lunch ?
the cafeteria . that &apos;s where all the subs eat .
all the subs and that new music teacher
who wants all the students to think that he &apos;s one of them .
yeah , i had a band once , too , cody .
point is , get out !
that day , my mom wasn &apos;t the only one searching
for a place to eat her lunch .
stupid geoff and evy ,
ruining the cool table with their love and unsanitary food play .
now i &apos;ve got nowhere to sit .
i &apos;m the one who needs to find the right table ,
&apos;cause where i sit will define me for the next four years .
it &apos;s just like &quot; the breakfast club . &quot;
look at the cliques --
the cheerleaders , the burners , the band geeks ,
the -- mom ? !
hey , kids ! over here !
come sit with your mother !
oh ! balls , balls , balls . - son of a --
um , your mom &apos;s here .
we know . we see her .
yoo @-@ hoo ! can you see me ?
she &apos;s waving very clearly at us .
i &apos;m your mama ! i pushed you out of my swimsuit area !
barry didn &apos;t want the jocks to
see him screaming uncontrollably at his mother .
i &apos;ve got grapes .
so he sent me over to talk some sense into her .
let &apos;s just go before this gets worse .
well , park your cute , little tushies .
i &apos;m having a terrible first day .
i can &apos;t sit with my mom at lunch .
i &apos;m already the sweaty jacket kid .
it would ruin any shred of cool i have left .
forgive me , mrs. g. , but barry wants you to know ,
&quot; get out , you monster !
get out through that window right now ! &quot;
if you don &apos;t sit at this table ,
then i have failed as a mother and an educator .
you are not an educator !
you are just a crazy lady in a worm sweater !
okay , you are walking on very dangerous ground right now .
this worm is the only child i have left .
no one wants your sweater , and no one wants you !
goldbergs , please !
what on earth is going on over here ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on , earl .
you have some very mean ,
disrespectful children at this school .
well , they &apos;re your children .
tell them what happens to a student
when they sass @-@ mouth a teacher .
they get saturday detention .
why don &apos;t you tell her what happens to a teacher
who abuses her power ?
teachers get fired .
oh , my god . earl , write a detention .
it &apos;s not that hard !
whoa ! whoa ! everyone , go back to your lunches !
not okay . not okay .
what &apos;s not okay is you haven &apos;t told the blond lady
to hit the bricks !
yeah , man ! do your job !
barry was hoping you &apos;d step in and wanted to add , uh ,
&quot; grow some plums ! &quot;
okay , listen .
you kids cannot talk to me that way ,
&apos;cause now you really do have saturday detention .
what ? !
no !
how am i in trouble ?
i &apos;m just barry &apos;s messenger .
well , then deliver this one --
i expect to see him saturday , too .
so much for my year of awesome !
oh , yeah ! oh , yeah .
i officially give up ,
and not just because my mom invaded my school ,
but because i suck at love and i &apos;m gonna die alone !
forever alone !
don &apos;t mind her . she &apos;s a basket case .
also , you &apos;re fired from the job you never had .
is it because i screamed out a bad word in the cafeteria ?
sort of a grab bag of things .
it was 7 : 00 a.m. saturday morning ,
and my dream of living &quot; the breakfast club &quot;
had become way too real .
well , well .
here we are .
it is now 7 : 06 .
you have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes
to ponder the error of your ways .
my office is right across that hall .
any monkey business is ill @-@ advised .
questions ?
i got a question .
does barry manilow know that you raid his wardrobe ?
well , aren &apos;t you nice ?
i happen to be quite the fanilow .
no , it &apos;s from a movie .
it &apos;s what the cool kid does --
and he &apos;s gone .
eight hours ? this is a nightmare .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just like &quot; the breakfast club . &quot;
think about it . we &apos;re just like the characters .
lainey &apos;s the popular princess . barry &apos;s the jock .
and erica &apos;s ally sheedy , the crazy , unstable basket case .
hey ! i &apos;m just a little depressed and unshowered
&apos;cause i &apos;m having a few boy issues , and ...
shut up !
and i , of course , am bender , the troubled bad boy .
you &apos;re the nerd , nerd . everyone knows it .
i am not the nerd .
you &apos;re the nerd , dude .
who are you , and why are you here ?
i &apos;m johnny atkins , and i &apos;m always here .
so needlessly destructive .
that &apos;s such an anthony michael hall thing to say .
totally .
classic nerdery .
i am not the nerd .
i guess there will just be two bad boys .
can &apos;t have two bad boys .
okay . babe , let &apos;s bail .
how ? the only way out is past ball &apos;s office .
or is it ?
again , this is just like the movie .
no one cares about the stupid movie !
now help me into the ceiling like in the movie !
while barry was running away from detention ,
my mom was retreating to what she knew best .
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , you know me . busy , busy , busy .
if i don &apos;t get dinner on the table , nobody else will .
it &apos;s 8 : 00 in the morning .
she &apos;s in a tizzy . help her .
bevy , you do this when you &apos;re upset .
or happy .
but right now , upset .
i &apos;m not upset .
this house is a mess
because i let that silly , little teaching job get in the way ,
but now i know this is where i belong .
but that teaching job meant so much to you .
well , this family means so much more to me .
also , nobody from the school wants me there .
that &apos;s not true .
principal ball literally said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you here . &quot;
well , that could mean anything .
and the kids say i ruined their lives .
they ruined ours , too . it &apos;s the circle of life .
and the teachers hate my guts .
well , there &apos;s history there .
and i got fired .
well , they clearly don &apos;t want you there ,
so that makes sense .
you &apos;re not good at this .
i just realized i &apos;m not a teacher .
i &apos;m a mom .
i &apos;m gonna go cheese @-@ up some cod .
seeing my mom abandon her dream ,
my dad did the unimaginable .
he got involved .
we need to talk .
oh , good .
first week wouldn &apos;t seem complete
without uncomfortable quality time
with every goldberg .
you need to let beverly be a teacher again .
the thing is , she never was a teacher ,
and she won &apos;t be as long as i &apos;m in charge .
i think you &apos;re looking at this the wrong way .
if beverly works for you ,
she no longer comes here as a mother .
she &apos;s an employee .
who &apos;s the boss of all the employees ?
i am .
that means she &apos;d no longer be your worst nightmare .
she &apos;d be the worst nightmare of anyone you want her to be .
that &apos;s a scary amount of power .
i think you unleash the power .
you give me the word , and beverly will be here .
get on the horn and make it happen .
i am taking my saturdays back !
the harpsichord in our living room
has been silent for too long !
hot dog !
i &apos;ll call my wife .
she &apos;s gonna be thrilled .
you stupid , stupid man !
how could you do this to me ?
you were so sad !
i actually did something good for once !
seriously ?
who marches down to the school
and makes unreasonable demands ?
you do ! all the time !
and who cares ?
earl said he wants you back .
doesn &apos;t matter .
even if ball wants me there , my own kids don &apos;t .
well , who &apos;s gonna sit here all day
and watch these damn kids ?
you wanted to get involved ? get involved .
aw , man .
i did not think this through .
i &apos;m hungry , and my thighs are so crampy .
why didn &apos;t i just go out the window ?
while barry was losing his way in the intricate maze of air ducts ,
we were losing our minds from boredom .
i really need to shower .
all right , morons . listen up .
dad ? why are you here ?
i &apos;ve been put in charge .
sweet . you &apos;re not a teacher , so we can bail .
oh ! i &apos;m worse than a teacher . i &apos;m your dad .
and that means i can take away everything you know and love .
well , you &apos;re not my dad , so i &apos;m out of here , man .
that &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t even know who that is .
the rest of you are gonna be writing an essay of at least 1,000 words .
an essay that will bond us together
like in &quot; the breakfast club &quot; ?
no . you &apos;re gonna write nice things about your mom .
make her feel like you want her around all the time .
that &apos;s the opposite of what we want .
do it , morons !
the next time i come in here , i &apos;m crackin &apos; skulls !
freedom !
our breakfast club was passing us by ,
and i was getting desperate .
guys , this is crazy .
the day &apos;s almost over and we &apos;ve yet to bond
or reveal our deepest secrets .
this isn &apos;t a john hughes movie , dude .
no ! i refuse to accept that .
bonding will happen , and it starts right now !
come on . this seems super hokey ,
but we &apos;ll accept each other through our awkward movement .
not gonna work .
dear god . pass .
what &apos;s wrong ? scared ?
i fear nothing !
watch me destroy you with dance ! i &apos;ll show you !
and just like that , we forgot about ...
... who we were trying to be or thought we were .
we were just us .
and after spending all day
trying to force everybody to get closer ...
a little goofy dancing ... like in an &apos; 80s teen movie
allowed it just to happen naturally .
and when it was over ,
i finally found myself sitting ...
in a &quot; breakfast club &quot; -style trust circle .
i know we &apos;re in school and all ,
but thanks for not ignoring me today .
i wish we could be like this
when we &apos;re back to school monday , but i @-@ i get it .
no one wants to hang out with a nerd .
but i thought you were the bad boy .
no . i &apos;m the same as i was in middle school .
six layers of boiling @-@ hot clothes won &apos;t change that .
yeah , i &apos;m not a jock .
sure , i have the awesome skills and talent ,
but i just can &apos;t be that sweet and caring .
it &apos;s not in me .
i tried to convince myself i don &apos;t care about geoff and evy ,
but every day , i &apos;ll be reminded that i blew it .
and you were right .
i really am a basket case .
and i &apos;m just a mom .
god , what are you doing here ? !
i thought we were all sharing our feelings .
this is our trust circle ! you &apos;re ruining it !
oh , you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t belong here .
i don &apos;t belong anywhere .
we &apos;re sitting here
struggling over who we are in high school ...
and you &apos;re going through the same thing .
i know . it &apos;s silly .
no , it &apos;s not .
you always say you &apos;re &quot; just a mom , &quot;
but you &apos;re more than that .
you think so ?
dad was right .
you always support our dreams no matter what .
so i guess now it &apos;s our turn .
really ? you want me here ?
oh , absolutely not .
i will run from you .
but for once , it &apos;s not about us .
that is so sweet .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the essay you made us write .
looks kind of long .
just , uh , tell me the highlights .
it says ... &quot; we love our mom .
everything she is and everything she wants to be .
but the truth is , up until today ...
... that &apos;s all we thought she was --
just a mom .
but she &apos;s so much more than that .
we all are .
even though we all look at each other in the simplest terms ...
with the most convenient definitions ,
we &apos;re more than that .
we &apos;re not just a geek ...
or a jock ...
or a basket case . &quot;
hey , guys .
erica ! there she is !
where you been all week ?
laying low . but i &apos;m back .
&quot; or a mom . &quot;
teachers only .
the blond lady stays .
beverly , some jerk parked in my space .
this will not stand .
&quot; in the end , we &apos;re a family . &quot;
i got to go move my car .
&quot; and that means we &apos;re in it together .
sincerely yours , the breakfast club . &quot;
what &apos;s &quot; the breakfast club &quot; ?
my dad asked a good question .
no one knew .
but what we did know was the goldbergs ...
were hardly as cool as judd nelson and molly ringwald .
but as i began my freshman year ,
it sure as hell felt that way .
what are you doing ?
nothing . go away .
okay , well , since you &apos;re frozen ,
i &apos;m gonna take my gnub @-@ gnubs .
gnub , gnub !
no ! no !
no gnub @-@ gnubs in public !
oh , you get back here !
you get back here !
oh , hi .
um , i got go to school now . uh ...
go put a pair of socks on ! go get dressed !
it &apos;s a quarter after 7 : 00 . please .
a quarter after 7 : 00 ?
yes .
what &apos;s with the bolo tie ?
i &apos;ve come to terms that i &apos;m the lovable nerd ,
like duckie from &quot; pretty in pink . &quot;
and i &apos;ve decided to embrace it .
wait . why are you guys wearing hats , too ?
&apos;cause i want the cool kids to think i &apos;m a rugged adventurer ,
like indiana jones .
and i &apos;m hoping this devo hat
lands me a spot in the new wave crowd .
gentlemen , high school &apos;s gonna rock .
nice hats , hat boys .
you &apos;re all wearing hats like idiots !
that &apos;s your thing !
later , hat heads .
high school &apos;s gonna suck .
