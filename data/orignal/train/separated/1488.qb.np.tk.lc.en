they &apos;re selling air .
closetcon is the premier north american trade show
for the closet industry .

thank you .
this schedule is incredible .
dad , there &apos;s a 10 : 45 session
on sustainable materials .
we have got to hit that .
mm , but it overlaps with the 11 : 00 a.m. panel on paneling .
and a breakout session on shoe storage .
little advice --
the convention floor is for suckers .
all work is done at the bar --
unless tony g. and layla are singing standards ,
in which case , no work -- prepare to be entertained .
dad , i came here to learn ,
not sit at the bar and drink .

well , i do need to meet everybody .
ooh , good . breakfast .

there &apos;s actually an animal that runs toward that sound , huh ?
hello , hello !
did you make the reservation ?
yeah , 7 : 00 .
fun family time with this little newsy
and a steak dinner .
who says people at the closet convention get all the fun ?
no one . no one says that .
i am telling you , the way he looked at me
when i came to the door -- it is so on .
kind of seemed like he was just delivering pizza ,
and you were giving him money .
what are you guys talking about ?
chuck , the pizza guy from last night .
he &apos;s shy and thoughtful
and wears a princeton sweatshirt --
hardly haley &apos;s type .
oh , my god . you love him .
what ? no ! i d-- how would you say i love him ?
he &apos;s been to our house exactly three times .
that &apos;s ridiculous , haley ! don &apos;t even look at me .
this is so stupid .
she loves him .
hey , &quot; manimal . &quot; how was picture day ?
you know what &apos;s super @-@ helpful ?
when the guy in line behind you calls you &quot; mount sweatmore . &quot;
i was trying to relax you .
it was right in front of you
- &quot; brad pitt @-@ stains . &quot;
come on , luke .
it &apos;s okay .
new security system ?
you can see the backyard ,
the front door , the garage -- everywhere .
yeah , can &apos;t take any chances
since mom gave birth to
the hope diamond over there .
there is a room off the kitchen at jay &apos;s house
that &apos;s always locked .
i try it every time i &apos;m there .
i &apos;ve spent countless hours imagining that that room
is a house of treasure ...
a palace of ceaseless wonder .
it &apos;s real .
hello , old friend .
would you look at that ?
what ? ! that &apos;s coconuts !
no !
is that --
a replica of apollo 13 .
look at the detail .
you can almost see the astronauts
drinking teeny , tiny tang .
can i hold it ?
no .
you have any idea how valuable this is ?
and your fingers are covered in cheese dust .
there .
no ! luke , please !
hey , guys . knock it off .
don &apos;t worry , gloria . i got it .
nobody panic ! !
this is a collector &apos;s edition . it &apos;s 40 years old !
we &apos;re gonna have to improvise .
gloria , call the steakhouse and cancel .
manny , find some glue .
luke , let &apos;s get these parts into the garage .
i know this seems impossible ,
but we can do this !
hello . houston &apos;s ?
we have a situation .
hi . we &apos;re with closetcon . all @-@ access .
she doesn &apos;t care . you &apos;re the only dope wearing that here .
give it to me .
no . i like it .
hey . joel .
looking good , my friend .
took a bath on automated closets .
people aren &apos;t ready for that .
jay pritchett . get your cute butt over here .
who &apos;s that ?
an old friend .
i &apos;m gonna go say hello . why don &apos;t you get us a couple drinks ?
yeah . i &apos;ll do that .
hi . can i get a scotch and a white wine ?
wow , rowdy crowd , huh ?
trade shows -- people get away from their families ,
get a little liquored up .
yeah , i get that .
let &apos;s just say when the nametags go on ,
the wedding rings come off .
i am not so on board with that .
hey , there .
classy .
let me just fix this . you &apos;re looking so great .
my mom was pretty self @-@ involved ,
and my dad traveled a lot for work .
so , yeah , i did wonder if ... you know .
and not that i could blame him .
my friend alison &apos;s mom
greeted her every day after school
with a big hug and a giant smile ,
and i always thought , &quot; yeah ...
wouldn &apos;t mind a piece of that . &quot;
so , are we doing this ?
i &apos;ll bring it to your room this afternoon .
we have a little tradition at closetcon for rookies ,
which claire is this year .
we take a skeleton . we hide it in their closet .
they open the door and scream ,
and we all have a good laugh .
can &apos;t take full credit for the idea .
we stole it from cabinetcon .
hot cider .
oh , yes . thank you , barb .
thank you so much .
it &apos;s chilly .
mmm . wow , that &apos;s got a kick .
that &apos;ll be the rum .
i can feel it warming up your belly .
yeah , still in my mouth and throat .
well , what &apos;s that ?
boy , it starting to get nippy , huh ?
you guys want to walk down to the duck pond ?
um -- that sounds lovely . i &apos;ll get the gun .
are y &apos;all coming ?
&quot; y &apos;all &quot; ?
we don &apos;t say &quot; y &apos;all &quot; !
yeah , we do .
no , well , yeah , we say it ... here , but not normally .
well , did you ever think this is how i really talk
and that i talk different @-@ like when i &apos;m not here ?
y &apos;all fighting ?
no , no , sweetie , we &apos;re just having a conversation
about how your daddy can be so stuck @-@ up .
cam , that &apos;s really mature .
use our daughter to get your little digs in .
i would never do that , sweetie .
you don &apos;t think i notice
how condescending you are when we come here ?
you just set on the porch . you roll your eyes .
you don &apos;t participate in anything .
and , yeah , i said &quot; set . &quot;
but that &apos;s how we talk here .
i &apos;m from this place . i &apos;m proud of this place .
and it hurts me that the man i love just thinks it &apos;s some big joke .
come on , sweetie .
lord a &apos;mercy .
ugh . i &apos;m starving . what are we gonna do about dinner ?
i checked with dad , and i ordered a couple pizzas from theo &apos;s .
i knew it ! you &apos;re stalking my pizza guy !
he is not into you , okay ?
does he call you &quot; brown eyes &quot;
and give you extra mozzarella sticks ?
okay , that &apos;s it , you two !
you cannot fight over men like it &apos;s jewelry or shoes .
if you &apos;re both interested , no one makes a move .
sisters before misters !
stalker !
trollop .
ha @-@ ha , don &apos;t know what it means --
what did you do ? !
nothing !
aah ! yes , you did ! you turned it on ,
and now the propeller &apos;s all tangled up !
why would i do that ?
&apos;cause my pizza guy is coming ,
and now i have airplane in my hair !
i swear i didn &apos;t , haley . okay .
i &apos;ll get it out . oh , my god , ow !
what is happening ? !
i don &apos;t know !
ohh , you find a little toy ?
hey , was that aunt marge
just tearing down the driveway ?
yes . and she dropped off a little present .
is that my cam cam ?
gram gram !
oh , you .
there have been some storm warnings ,
so marge thought she &apos;d be safer over here .
but she dropped her off so fast
that we didn &apos;t even have a chance to straighten up .
we never told gram about the gay .
you know , after they reach a certain age ,
you worry that it could
be the thing that sends them over the edge ,
and she &apos;s been on the edge for a long time .
we &apos;re actually on deathbed number two .
mitchell . mitchell .
okay . w @-@ what &apos;s this ?
this is me ready to slop , bale , or milk something .
you don &apos;t need to do that .
no , i -- cam , i @-@ i know .
i know i gave you hell for being who you really are ,
and i want to make that up to you .
yeah , but you know what ?
putting on my sister &apos;s sunday overalls is gesture enough .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , it &apos;s my chewing straw .
it &apos;s not straw . - oh , it &apos;s just show -- for show .
hey . come on , come on .
you know , you love the man ,
you love the world he comes from .
yeah , but you know what ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s these farming clothes or what ,
but i am feeling so close to you right now .
well , that &apos;s so sweet .
now give me a kiss .
no , not right now .
well , don &apos;t make me rassle you down .
who &apos;s this ?
oh , dear .
uh ... well , grams , this is bud , our new farmhand .
bud ?
yeah , bud &apos;s a little simpleminded
on account of getting mule @-@ kicked , isn &apos;t he ?
and you know the rules on being in the house , bud .
now , go on outside .
we &apos;re gonna milk the cows in a few minutes .
get on out there . have a treat afterwards .
here &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to work with .
nicely done . i &apos;ve got florida on the line .
dad , i &apos;m flying you in . you &apos;re the model expert .
what are we looking at , son ?
holy moses .
more like apollo 1,300 pieces !
in space , i guess no one can hear you be hilarious .
i need you to focus .
if jay sees this ...
i know !
dad , you &apos;ve got three good men here depending on you .
say no more -- i &apos;m gonna tap a button now
that &apos;s either gonna make you
larger on my screen or --
we &apos;ve lost florida .
yeah , yeah . bring the skeleton up now . i just got to the room .
hey , dad .
hey , honey .
i thought we were meeting at the restaurant .
yeah , well , the lecture got done a little early ,
and i was kind of the star of the evening .
i got a huge laugh when i coined the phrase
&quot; shelf @-@ esteem . &quot;
huh ? yeah ?
okay , i &apos;ll text it to phil .
why don &apos;t you go down to the lobby ? you &apos;ll get a stronger signal .
oh . hello .
rita .
this is my daughter , claire .
hi .
claire , this is rita .
your dad and i go way back .
first time we met , i told him
he needed a course in &quot; hanger &quot; management .
it &apos;s still funny .
seriously ?
her husband &apos;s in the garment business .
he made me a suit .
i make the closets , and he fills them .
match made in heaven .
honey , they &apos;re kind of sticklers at that restaurant .
why don &apos;t you grab our table ? i &apos;ll put this in the room .
uh , okay . will do .
um , really nice to meet you .
see you downstairs .
i actually am gonna take the stairs .
that elevator is slow .
hey , was it just me ,
or was she looking at me weird ?
i did kind of sense that .
you don &apos;t think she knows about our deal ?
how could she ? it was 20 years ago .
and i never told anyone .
would she even care ?
that i tried to get rid of the man she ended up marrying ?
well , it &apos;s not like you took a hit out on him .
you had me offer him a job
in the greatest state in the union .
okay , tex .
if i never said anything , how could she know ?
you &apos;re not the first one i approached .
you &apos;re just the first one who said yes .
i &apos;m done . i &apos;m done
come on .
please , just be bud -- for a couple days .
you can do some chores , maybe i can
berate you a little bit to really sell it .
do you hear how insane you sound ?
chores ?
all right , you know what ?
you -- you deal with your grandmother however you want .
lily and i will just go get a hotel room .
no , you can &apos;t .
fine . motel , silo --
whatever you got around here .
no , that alarm means there &apos;s a tornado coming right now .
oh , god . well , where &apos;s lily ?
i hope she &apos;s not still out in the field .
lil @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y !
you can &apos;t just call her like a pig !
lil @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y !
okay , this is just a farm thing ,
not , like , a mall thing .
what &apos;s that , city voice ? hmm ?
just go .
this is really in there good .
get her off of me .
i &apos;m getting dumb through osmosis .
i don &apos;t have osmosis .
oh , great . chuck &apos;s here with the pizza .
gloria , can you please get it ?
no . you two be nice to each other
and figure it out .
oh , hey , chuck .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be working tonight .
hey . what are you doing here ?
oh , this is my grandfather &apos;s house .
there &apos;s a pool . do you swim ?
you look like you swim .
i do .
oh , thanks .
you okay ?
oh , yeah . totally . just a cramp .
i work out . one second .
you little ...
shut up .
hey , you .
hey , brown eyes .
okay , cool . thanks . bye .
bye !
what ?
shut up , dork .
don &apos;t be nervous , honey .
there &apos;s nothing to be scared of .
take it easy , mama . don &apos;t break a hip .
i &apos;m telling you right now .
i am not pretending to be something i &apos;m not ,
especially in front of our daughter .
oh , so i can &apos;t kiss you in front of your dad for six years ,
and you can &apos;t give me two days ?
we &apos;re saving an old lady some unnecessary upset .
why don &apos;t you give her a little credit ?
she might be more open @-@ minded than you think .
well , you &apos;re a cute little chinese thing .
actually , gram , she &apos;s , uh , from vietnam ,
and her name &apos;s lily .
dad , how long do we have to stay down here ?
&quot; dad &quot; ?
okay , well , i guess there &apos;s no way around this .
ac-- actually , ma &apos;am ...
... she &apos;s my kin .
so , you got a chinese wife , bud ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i went to vietnam ,
and i did myself some adopting ,
and now i &apos;m raising her all by my lonesome .
well , i never thought i &apos;d live long enough to see that .
none of us did .
but i guess there &apos;s nothing more important than family ...
no matter how they come .
well , that is mighty open @-@ minded of you .
some folks &apos; round these parts don &apos;t share that progressive--
i say progressive-- sensibility .
to each his own .
but i do wish i had another
little one like that to spoil .
what if i told you you did have a great @-@ grandbaby ?
what ?
cam ...
it &apos;s okay , mama .
what if i told you i was in love ,
and that i &apos;ve never been happier in my entire life ,
and that i &apos;m about to get married ?
i can &apos;t think of anything better .
and what if i told you the love of my life
is this man standing right here ?
then i &apos;d know why god sent us this tornado .
damn .
after the initial shock , gram softened a bit .
she even agreed to attend the wedding .
standing outside with a sign .
baby steps , mitchell . baby steps .
and ... our antenna is ...
reattached .
yes !
oh , this is useless .
hey , i don &apos;t want to hear talk like that .
if you want inspiration , think about apollo 13 .
jay didn &apos;t give up when he first put together this model .
it was hard and complicated , and back then ,
the print on the instructions was tiny ,
but he persevered .
also , the astronauts on the actual apollo 13
didn &apos;t give up when their actual lives were in danger .
them , too , but they had a lot of other people helping them out .
we &apos;re on our own here .
okay , i figured out what we need
to reattach that damn landing module .
glue won &apos;t work .
we need a very thin filament--
thinner than thread .
i know what will work .
well , i need to go check on something .
i told my date i &apos;d be back in a jiff .
back in a jiff .
nothing to do but wait .
why are we making ourselves crazy , phil ?
i don &apos;t know . i just hate disappointing jay so much .
he is not an easy guy to please .
i know , but when you do , it &apos;s pretty sweet , ain &apos;t it ?
sure is .
you &apos;re lucky to have a dad like that .
hard not to be hurt by that , son .
how have i never noticed how loud you breathe ?
aw , don &apos;t beat yourself up-- that &apos;d require you
to notice something that isn &apos;t about you .
oh , my god , you are such a loser !
i can &apos;t be stuck to you all day !
okay , that &apos;s it ! i cannot listen to this anymore !
i &apos;m going to cut you two out of there .
no ! gloria , no ! my hair !
too late !
okay , okay ! just cut mine .
yeah , cut hers ! wait . why ?
no one cares what i look like , anyway .
you don &apos;t really think that .
yeah , well , kind of .
you didn &apos;t see the way that chuck was looking at you ?
wait , you actually think i &apos;m a threat ?
i &apos;m not gonna say that out loud .
aww , that &apos;s so sweet .
well , if i ever had a boyfriend ,
i wouldn &apos;t trust him with you for five seconds .
okay . let &apos;s finish this job .
gloria , no , you can &apos;t cut--
and there you go .
that &apos;s it . that was easy .
why did you wait an hour to do this ?
why did you wait 15 years to do that ?
at least this way , nothing bad happened
to anyone &apos;s pretty hair .
oh , honey . i didn &apos;t hear you come in .
how was the rest of your night ?
let &apos;s see .
after you bailed on me ,
mark from closetopia yakked my ear off ,
and then told me i look like heidi klum ,
which is such an obvious come @-@ on .
mark &apos;s gay .
well , in that case , my night stank .
and i didn &apos;t bail .
i know a lot of people here . they pulled me away .
hey , these robes are terrific .
you know , there &apos;s one for you in the closet .
you ought to put it on .
i don &apos;t want a robe .
dad , were you avoiding me tonight ?
why would i avoid you ?
trust me -- soft , like butter .
right in there .
don &apos;t make me ask .
what are you talking about ?
you and rita 20 years ago --
it &apos;s okay . i know .
oh , geez .
i get it . things happen .
really ?
it was a long time ago .
well , i appreciate it .
i just want to say i &apos;m not proud of it .
if i had known him then like i know him now ,
i never would have tried to get rid of phil .
good night .
&quot; get rid of phil &quot; ? what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?
you and rita had an affair .
no , we didn &apos;t . that &apos;s crazy .
well , okay , good night .
&quot; get rid of phil &quot; -- what does that even mean ?
it doesn &apos;t mean anything . you had just started dating .
you know i was never hot on the guy .
i told rita to offer him
a sales job in texas .
i remember that , but that wasn &apos;t when we were dating .
we were engaged .
doesn &apos;t matter .
phil didn &apos;t take the job anyway .
if anything , my little test
proved how much he loved you .
you &apos;re welcome . we &apos;ll talk in the morning .
oh , how dare you -- &quot; you &apos;re welcom &quot; please .
oh , i can &apos;t even be in the same room with you .
where is my coat ?
uh , claire .
ugh , unbelievable .
&quot; i don &apos;t like my son @-@ in @-@ law ,
so i &apos;m gonna ship him off to texas . &quot;
real mature way to deal with your problems , dad .
i get that point .
yeah . real mature .
that &apos;s real mature , too .
that &apos;s tradition .
it &apos;s the skeleton ...
in the closet . oh , i get it .
i &apos;m really sorry , but before you go storming out of here ,
you want to talk about a certain phone call i got
from immigration a few years ago ?
i had just started dating gloria .
they were acting on an anonymous tip .
it &apos;s very late .
we have a very big day tomorrow .
you know , claire , i &apos;ve really come to like phil .
i know .
and the irony is ,
he would really love that skeleton gag .
try it out on him . you got
to take care of that thing till next year .
oh , god .
wait , before you turn that out ,
have we talked about everything we need to ?
&apos;cause i want everything out in the clear here .
yeah . we have .
good night .
i did make out with rita once about 15 years ago .
good night .
okay .
all that &apos;s left ...
is to reattach the lander to the command module .
we got one shot at this , fellas .
if we fail ,
jay &apos;s gonna burn up on re @-@ entry into this house . am i right ?
hole in one , son !
thanks , dad .
boys , if this thing goes sideways ,
i don &apos;t want you to be here to see it .
so go on . - but , dad --
no , you listen to me !
okay , phil .
okay , philip .
steady .
he &apos;s locked in .
not now , nerves .
hold .
hold .
be a hero .
bring her home .
i guess i &apos;ll call a cab .
so long , jeanine .
is it ? is --
it is !
splashdown !
son of a bitch , he did it .
yeah ! gloria , get in here !
there we go !
dad , you did it !
yes , i did !
i love it ! i love it !
i love it !
phil , honey . come to bed .
this robe feels like butter .
i missed this , honey .
that yoga &apos;s really paying off .
hey , whoa . slow down , baby .
you can &apos;t gun a cold engine .
but if you &apos;re -- then who &apos;s --
when did you know ?
when it didn &apos;t complain about my socks .
you checked the closet , didn &apos;t you ?
every night before bed .
i really don &apos;t understand it . it &apos;s so silly .
i mean , if somebody really wanted to kill you ,
obviously they &apos;d just hide under the bed .
good night .
