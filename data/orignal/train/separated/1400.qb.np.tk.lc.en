i just want him to fit in .
i &apos;m gonna take a shower . do you care to join me ?
you know , honey , there &apos;s a gun in the footlocker in the garage .
if i ever say no to that question ,
i want you to use it on me .
miss mary mack , mack , mack .
all dressed in black , black , black .
shh , shh .
what &apos;s wrong ?
with silver buttons , buttons , buttons .
all down her back , back , back .
why aren &apos;t they trying to hurt each other ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m afraid to move .
you &apos;re really good at this .
thanks .

what do you think ?
now , that is a scone .
no butter . nonfat .
shut up .

oh , god . that &apos;s a bad sign .

now i &apos;m sad .
hi , honey . mmm !

well , i couldn &apos;t wait to see your new baby . where is she ?
mitchell , who was that ?

oh , yeah , right ,
&apos;cause the last time she was here ,
the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves into a penta ...
grandma !
第一季第四集
mom . mom , what are you doing to her legs ?
tai chi . i did it every day in sedona .
cameron , you should try it .
mitchell &apos;s mother has a problem ...
with me .
last christmas , for example ,
she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer .
so , to recap ,
i gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings ,
and she gave me a hint .
and living in sedona has been transformational .
i get up every morning , and i go to a vortex meditation site ...
and work with a shaman to
finally understand how to live my spirituality .
yikes .
and i &apos;ve learned that
the only way i can move to the next level of my awakening ...
is if we all can somehow ...
get past ...
the incident .
oh , no .
the incident .
oh , boy .
i would like to congratulate jay and the lovely gloria .
i &apos;m very happy for them .
i wanted a big , beautiful wedding with jay ...
because my ex @-@ husband and i got married ...
in a tiny little office of a judge in colombia .
my mother wanted to go to the wedding
to show everyone how okay she was with all of it ,
so i convinced dad and gloria to invite her .
who warned you that that was the worst idea ever ?
anyone ?
anyone ?
of course , i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve moved on .
i was supposed to come with a date ,
but he just hurt his back ,
which is very ironic because he &apos;s young and @-@ and healthy .
my mom started drinking ...
these cocktails called &quot; horny colombians ... &quot;
with some of gloria &apos;s uncles ,
whom apparently the drink was named after .
oh , come on . they were funny .
they kept patting my butt .
somebody &apos;s full of herself .
it &apos;s a- it &apos;s a colombian wedding tradition , they said .
i would like to make a toast .
yeah . nanna got totally wasted .
uh , it was really funny .
then it was gross .
to the bride and the groom- my ex .
thirty @-@ five years we were together ,
and he couldn &apos;t wait 10 minutes to run off with charo .
that &apos;s a joke .
seriously , i knew they were perfect for each other ...
when i saw his wallet and her boobs .
take your hands off me !
mom . mom .
oh , relax , mitchell .
what , did you take your claire pill ?
no , no .
let &apos;s just go get a little fresh air , okay ?
and then it got weird .
i &apos;m gloria ! i &apos;m gloria !
i got her .
kiss me ! oh , hey , kiss me !
no ! oh , geez .
nanna is really strong .
ayayayayay ! ooh ! ayayayayay !
during my vows to my first husband ,
drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge .
this was way worse .
what can i say ? i drive women crazy .
it &apos;s too soon , i guess .
everybody is going to be there , mom !
i don &apos;t care .
your father and i are not about to let you
drive two hours to go to a concert ...
and then spend the night with a bunch of boys ,
especially that 17 @-@ year @-@ old hormone you &apos;re dating .
it &apos;s totally supervised .
oh , really ? by whom ?
by spencer patine &apos;s uncle .
who &apos;s spencer patine ?
you know spencer- the guy with the arm .
wait . what kind of arm ?
what is that even mean ?
his uncle is uncle toby .
oh , uncle toby . i &apos;ll be sure to include that in my amber alert .
通过媒体向社会发布的警报 &#93;
oh , my god !
okay . can i step in here ?
i think i can help .
haley , what your mom is worried about ...
is you getting your heart broken
when dylan goes off to college next year .
he &apos;s not going to college .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m-
he &apos;s not going to college ?
he &apos;s in a band , okay ? they &apos;re going on tour .
oh , this just gets better and better .
why are you always on me about everything ?
because you need to understand ...
okay . everybody , calm down !
let &apos;s start from the beginning .
what &apos;s wrong with spencer &apos;s arm ?
mom , i &apos;m home !
ay , baby ! did you have fun at the slumber party ?
you must be exhausted .
no , i &apos;m not tired at all .
i was the first one to fall asleep .
what &apos;s on your face ?
a smile from having such a good time with my friends .
no . come here .
look .
that &apos;s why they were laughing .
i thought it was my funny take on current events .
why would they do something like that ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
guys pull pranks like that all the time .
you just gotta prank &apos; em back .
you just gotta show &apos; em
you &apos;re willing to give as good as you get .
what do you think ?
revenge .
i like it .
well , mom , instead of dredging up the whole incident ,
maybe we should just try and repress it ,
like a- like a normal family .
i can &apos;t . i need closure .
i &apos;m about to embark on a new journey .
i met a man .
really ?
his name is chas ,
and he &apos;s asked me to come live with him in his foreign land .
wow . where ?
canada .
you &apos;re moving to @-@ to canada ?
french canada .
that &apos;s wonderful .
it is wonderful .
it &apos;s just that when i think of all the awful things ...
that i said to gloria and jay and you and claire ,
i feel such guilt .
give it time , and see banff .
cam , please .
i just can &apos;t give myself to him sexually .
okay . mom .
did not see that coming .
oh , oh . don &apos;t get me wrong .
we satisfy each other down there-
oh ! can &apos;t ..
don &apos;t wanna-
that &apos;s why i need everyone &apos;s forgiveness .
i need your help , mitchell .
did you hear that , mitchell ?
your mom needs your help to make love to her new man , chas .
that &apos;s not weird at all .
mom , i-
i &apos;m just not really sure what you &apos;re asking me to do , mom .
well , everyone &apos;s mad at me .
maybe you could pave the way so that i can apologize .
well , um , you know ,
we are actually all supposed to have sunday dinner tonight ,
so maybe i could go around and ask everyone
if it &apos;s okay for you to join us .
oh ! i knew i could count on you .
oh , my beautiful boy . mmm .
i love you so much .
there &apos;s a fish in nature
that swims around with its babies in its mouth .
that fish would look at mitchell &apos;s relationship with his mother ...
and say , &quot; that &apos;s messed up . &quot;
boy-
things with your mom got pretty intense down there , huh ?
all like east coast @-@ west coast . you feelin &apos; me ?
act like a parent , talk like a peer .
i call it &quot; peerenting . &quot;
i learned it from my own dad , who used to walk into my room ...
and say , &quot; what &apos;s up , sweathog ? &quot;
honey , i would love to let you go to the concert .
are you kidding me ? i think concerts are rad .
hello ? i was a hall @-@ raiser .
a what ?
i followed hall &amp; oates around the country one summer .
&quot; rich girl &quot; just spoke to me .
i was dating this girl . not- not dating .
i guess i was following her too , kind of-
okay , mom just doesn &apos;t trust me , and it &apos;s not fair .
she trusts you . it &apos;s just that weird stuff happens at concerts .
boys get urges .
ew .
dad , is there something you want ?
yes , there is- to connect with this girl right here .
now , come on . pretend i &apos;m not your dad .
we &apos;re just a couple of friends kickin &apos; it in a juice bar .
what &apos;s a juice bar ?
okay , a malt shop . whatever .
dad , i don &apos;t ...
no . who &apos;s dad ?
who &apos;s dad ? i &apos;m- i &apos;m marcus from biology .
hey , haley . how &apos;s it going with you and dylan ?
has he tried anything inappropriate with you ?
girl .
hey .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know . nothing .
just talking to some dork i met in a malt shop .
hey , mitchell . what &apos;s up ?
hey ! just in the hood .
do you- do you remember how mom gave up a career to raise us ?
promising career .
oh , god .
claire ?
mom .
why so long ?
i know , i know . it &apos;s weird when we haven &apos;t talked for a while .
i mean your hair .
well , if i can &apos;t tell you , who will ?
so , mom wants you to know
that she &apos;s very sorry about the incident ,
and @-@ and she wants us to forgive her .
how very nice of her to say that through you .
do you see ?
the sarcasm is so hurtful , like a whip .
you know how growing up ,
we all have that voice inside our head ...
that tells us we &apos;re not good enough ?
well , mine was outside my head ,
driving me to school .
uh , so- so anyway ,
mom really wants to smooth everything over with dad and gloria .
so i was thinking , uh , would it be okay
if she maybe joined us for dinner tonight ?
because it may be the last time you ever see me .
well ...
okay . wait , mom .
what are you talking about ?
well , i &apos;m- i &apos;m moving ...
to a far and dangerous place .
canada . but , uh , she met a man named chas .
yeah .
he &apos;s a logger .
uh , like a lumberjack ?
no , he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study .
anyway , until i &apos;m past this whole wedding debacle ,
i can &apos;t be intimate with him .
we do things to each other .
we use our hands .
oh , my lord .
hey , nanna .
oh , my little comet !
oh , look at you . you &apos;re all grown up .
hmm . tell mom that .
she won &apos;t even let me go to a concert .
overnight , with her boyfriend .
what are you laughing at ?
oh , karma &apos;s a funny thing , that &apos;s all .
remember ricky ?
oh , god .
ooh . who &apos;s ricky ?
no one .
ricky was your mother &apos;s boyfriend ,
and he looked like charles manson .
and one night , she didn &apos;t come home until 4 : 00 in the morning .
4 : 00 . wow . wow . mom , what were you and ricky doing ?
nothing . we were doing nothing ,
and he was a very sweet boy ,
which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him .
dylan &apos;s a sweet boy .
dylan . dylan isn &apos;t ricky .
ricky- ricky was a poet .
dylan writes songs .
awesome songs .
and maybe you would know that
&quot; if you bothered to get to know him . &quot;
okay , you know ? first of all , i am not my mother .
i don &apos;t judge people before i get a chance to know them .
so you invite dylan over to dinner tonight ,
and if he &apos;s as sweet and as kind as you say he is ,
then i have no problem considering letting you go to the concert ,
after i do a background check on uncle toby .
thank you . thank you . thank you , mom .
i &apos;m gonna go call him !
that &apos;s very revealing .
that &apos;s my parenting style .
no , i meant your blouse .
mom !
claire , wait . come ...
not making this easy .
claire , come on . stop , stop , stop .
just let her come to dinner , apologize to dad and gloria ,
and she and chas can live happily ever after .
in canada .
in canada .
wait . why don &apos;t you make her fix this ,
instead of you doing it as usual ?
whoa . what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
mom makes a mess , and there &apos;s mitchell to clean it up .
that is so not true .
if anything ,
you &apos;re the one with the screwed @-@ up relationship with mommy-
with mom .
wow .
&quot; mommy &quot; !
no , i didn &apos;t say it-
damn it .
ooh . fine . fine .
she can come , but she &apos;s gotta clear it with daddy .
&quot; daddy &quot; ?
i did not say &quot; daddy . &quot;
you said &quot; daddy . &quot;
hey , dad .
mitchell , what are you doing here ?
uh , i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
can i talk to you and gloria for a second ?
she &apos;s out dealing with a manny situation .
he set a kid &apos;s bike on fire .
why ?
oh , i might have told him to get even with some kids ,
and he went all rambo with it .
not my best parenting moment .
not your worst .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , well , you know , uh , mom &apos;s in town .
your mom ?
no , your mom . she &apos;s back from the grave .
yes . yes , my mom , dad .
my mom would be less scary .
listen , she &apos;s a wreck about what happened at the wedding ,
and she wants to come to dinner tonight to apologize to everyone .
still her little errand boy , i see .
no- why does everybody keep saying- no .
i- i &apos;m just trying to piece this family back together .
so , you &apos;ll talk to gloria about mom coming to dinner ?
oh , gloria would never go for that in a million years .
she &apos;s still furious with your mother ,
which is why i &apos;m not talking to you .
what did i do ?
this conversation never took place .
that &apos;s not very nice .
i drove all the way here .
no , you didn &apos;t . you were never here .
you never even called .
i would &apos;ve called ,
but i thought it would be better-
what &apos;s happening here ?
listen , i would love to get this thing behind us ,
but gloria would never forgive me
if i pulled a fast one on her .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to pull a fast one on her ,
and i &apos;m not going to like it one bit .
okay , that &apos;s just great .
no , that &apos;s great . so , it &apos;s all up to me .
i can &apos;t hear you because you &apos;re back home , and i &apos;m taking a nap .
d @-@ money ! there he is .
hey .
come on in .
hey .
hi .
how you doing ?
good .
um- uh , hey , everybody .
this is dylan .
hey .
hi , dylan .
hey .
he has a very gentle soul .
you got that from &quot; hey &quot; ?
so , dylan , see you brought the ax .
yeah , yeah . i just came from practice .
sweet .
miss those days .
oh , you were in a band ?
could have been , but in high school
i was really all about my magic , so-
oh , my god . over .
oh , that &apos;s gonna be dad and gloria .
oh , mitchell .
i know it &apos;s silly , but ...
i &apos;m a little nervous .
oh . that &apos;s not silly . you should be .
hola . hola .
how are you ?
manny ?
phil .
nice mustache .
thank you .
don &apos;t make fun . he may burn your house down .
oh , boy .
dede .
hi , jay , gloria .
what is she doing here ?
what does she mean , &quot; what is she doing here ? &quot;
mitchell told you i &apos;d be here .
lies !
i couldn &apos;t tell her , because she wouldn &apos;t come .
gloria , uh , my mom wants to apologize for everything .
so you just spring it on gloria like this ?
mitchell , what the hell is wrong with you ?
i don &apos;t want her apologies .
who could blame you , honey ?
which is why this is a terrible idea by you !
jay . manny . let &apos;s go .
oh , wait , wait , gloria .
i- i just want to tell you
how sorry i am for ruining your wedding .
i was struggling with being alone .
meanwhile , jay moves on so easily ,
and @-@ and not with just anyone-
with a ...
young ...
and smart and beautiful woman .
i don &apos;t expect you to forgive me .
if i were you , i &apos;d want to punch me right in the mouth .
i think we &apos;ve had enough revenge in this family for one day .
ah . okay . y- you see ?
yeah , we &apos;re all gonna move past this , and because of me ,
who &apos;s not a mama &apos;s boy , but is
a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight .
so make a note , bitches .
it &apos;s not a good color on you .
i forgive you .
i am not prepared for this .
i just-
i- i wanna
rip your head off !
what ?
what are you doing ?
you ruined my wedding !
oh , no !
oh ! i got gloria !
i got gloria !
mom , come on .
unbend your legs .
i got gloria .
stand up like a big girl . come on .
all right . stop it . stop it . stop it , the two of you .
i am so sorry about this .
no , it &apos;s cool . it &apos;s cool .
this is ridiculous . gloria didn &apos;t steal me ,
dede , and you know it .
we grew apart for years ,
and you left to find yourself , remember ?
i thought i could handle this .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you don &apos;t say sorry anymore !
that word means nothing in your mouth !
i got gloria .
i don &apos;t know what just happened .
i do .
i mean , it seems pretty simple to me .
you &apos;re reaching out , trying to hold on to something awesome .
um , maybe- maybe you shouldn &apos;t ...
look , look , look . i &apos;m not used to this-
the whole big family thing .
in my house , we don &apos;t even talk to each other .
you know , it &apos;s funny- the first time i saw haley ,
i knew i liked her .
i mean , she &apos;s beautiful and everything ,
but it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not just that .
it &apos;s that she &apos;s got this killer confidence-
you know , the kind of confidence
that you get from having a family like this ...
that &apos;s passionate ...
and accepting of hot foreigners ...
and gay dudes and nutty people .
you know ,
a family that actually loves each other .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this ,
but maybe we should let her go with him .
he &apos;s perfect .
everybody , haley says that dylan is a musician ,
and he writes some great songs .
yeah .
play something , bro .
well , i guess so , if you want me to .
we could all use a nice tune right now .
this is , uh , actually a song i wrote for haley .
it &apos;s called &quot; in the moonlight . &quot;
lovely title , dylan .
thanks .
