what &apos;s with all the yogurt ?
shh ! durkas has been breaking into my locker .
but i &apos;ve got a little revenge planned .
sorry . i just remembered i don &apos;t really care .
where &apos;s mom ? oh , my god , what is that outfit ?
are you going goth ?
you still sleep with a stuffed panda .
don &apos;t you have a fraternity to pass out in ?
is there anything else you need for your procedure ?
um , i think i &apos;m supposed to have ice cream .
hmm . actually , i don &apos;t--
i &apos;m sorry . is it a vasecto @-@ you ,
or a vasectomy ?
you can have ice cream .
thanks .
today ... - snip @-@ a @-@ dee @-@ doo @-@ dah !
we @-@ we &apos;ve been talking about doing this for a while .
yeah . yeah , ever since dad and gloria
had their little accident ,
we don &apos;t need any surprises .
also , though ,
it will allow for a little more freestylin &apos; in the boudoir
if we &apos;re not having to worry about adding more critters .
more importantly ,
it is an essential part of our 5 @-@ year plan .
oh , the 5 @-@ year plan . talk about the--the rosses .
the rosses--okay ,
the rosses are this couple we have known forever , and ...
they were never able to have kids ,
so we always felt a little ...
jealous of them .
i mean , we love our kids ,
but john and chrissy can travel ...
they &apos;re always tan .
did you know that chrissy is eight years older than me ?
i would have said eight years younger .
there &apos;s just this spark in her that--
well , look who i &apos;m talking to . you used to have it .
wow . it &apos;s like you don &apos;t ... hear ...
the point is ,
as long as we don &apos;t have another baby ,
that life is ours in five years
when luke goes off to college .
or somewhere .
it will actually be a pleasure walking into that doctor &apos;s office today
there you are . mom--
hang on a second . what is this ?
is this because of your new friend skyler ?
oh , she &apos;s just trying to change her image .
nice work , by the way .
you went from dork to count dorkula .
can we talk about my clothes ? you were supposed to send them !
i &apos;ll be with you in a second . hang on .
i don &apos;t like this skylar .
you don &apos;t need to change who you are
to fit in with the cool kids .
oh , of course she does . she just is so uncool ,
she doesn &apos;t know who the cool kids are .
don &apos;t you have a class to fail ?
don &apos;t you have a raven to train ?
listen , i have repeated outfits twice this week .
it &apos;s a disaster .
and i will deal with it tomorrow ,
but today i &apos;m taking your father to the doctor .
he &apos;s having an ass @-@ ectomy .
what ?
i hear things .
you &apos;re getting your tonsils out ?
ohh ! this family needs a dumbass @-@ ectomy .
oh , shut up ! i &apos;m tired of you thinking you &apos;re so ...
did dad ever tell you you were adopted ?
no , i wasn &apos;t !
five more years .
okay .
okay , so after school ,
you &apos;re going to your friend ashley &apos;s to swim ,
so i &apos;m gonna need you to go get your swimsuit ,
your swim goggles , and your sunscreen , okay ?
and change into a dress that &apos;s not covered in cat fur .
oh , that cat is really losing its hair .
maybe we should slip it one of your propecia , huh ?
what propecia ?
your pro--
is that not something that we &apos;re ...
so , uh , what you got going on today ?
ohh . busy , busy , busy , busy .
i might buy some light bulbs , and then , if time permits ,
i might do a little work on my master project .
top secret .
so don &apos;t you dare ask what it is .
i won &apos;t .
since lily started kindergarten ,
cam &apos;s had a lot of free time .
now , i @-@ i &apos;d like to suggest he go back to work , but ...
historically , uh , that has proved to be a sensitive topic .
we sent those adoption papers to vietnam last summer .
no , thank you very much ,
and please remember my tone , not my words .
she said it could take up to nine months to get a baby .
it &apos;s inhuman !
is it ? don &apos;t-- i @-@ i know it &apos;s frustrating ,
but maybe instead of driving yourself crazy
waiting for the phone to ring , you could go back to work .
excuse me ?
get a job !
no , it--it &apos;ll help you take your mind off the baby .
oh , what , because i &apos;m a big , giant freeloader ?
actually , i think i laid out the reasons pretty clearly .
no , i think you pegged me . bone lazy ,
just like on the farm-- first to bed ,
last to wake up in the morning .
you know what ? why don &apos;t you call my dad ,
and you two can gab all night
about what a teet @-@ sucking layabout i am ?
okay , i think i might have paddled
into some deeper waters here .
what , you think i sit around all day ?
well , i &apos;m not sitting now .
what &apos;s happening ?
you keep a packed suitcase ?
that &apos;s a healthy baby .
hold on .
what ?
is that a license plate and a hubcap ?
you know , like in &quot; jaws &quot; ?
i never saw it .
i saw it , but i don &apos;t remember
a scene with a hubcap in a pregnant woman .
ah , forget it .
so , would you like to know if you &apos;re having a boy or a girl ?
yes .
no .
ay . i want it to be a surprise ,
don &apos;t you , jay ?
i &apos;m having a baby at 65 .
you want another surprise , gloria ?
buy yourself a box of cracker jacks .
estupid dry cleaners !
they shrink my clothes !
might be time for maternity wear .
are you crazy ? i &apos;m barely showing .
sweetheart ,
your shirts barely fit before you were pregnant .
and i never heard you complain .
we &apos;re gonna need a bigger belt .
come on .
this is hard .
hey , cam .
who &apos;s hungry ?
ohh ! were you thinking about dropping by for lunch ...
again ?
you know , i @-@ i really wish i could ,
but it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s a zoo around here .
um ... but , hey , cam--
cam , would you mind , uh , stopping by longinus &apos; boutique
and picking up a few shirts for me ?
sure .
thank you .
or we can do it together .
hey !
hey !
hi .
hi .
how are you ?
good .
okay .
um ... that &apos;s-- that &apos;s good . okay . yeah .
you didn &apos;t send the little green jacket ? !
honey , i am not doing this again .
it took me an hour to mail that package before .
i have post @-@ post office traumatic stress disorder .
stop smiling . it &apos;s not that clever .
it is clever ,
and there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going back there today .
oh , my god , i hate you so much !
oh , sorry , that &apos;s your father . gotta go !
claire , where are you ?
oh , honey , i just had a hellish experience at the post office .
i have post @-@ post office traumatic stress disorder .
nailed it .
yes !
and luke forgot his science project ,
so now i &apos;m at the school dropping it off .
um , but what about my appointment ?
i &apos;m so sorry , honey . i made other arrangements ,
but i promise i will be there when you wake up .
arrangements ?
what--um ... wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
what--what arrangements ?
i , um ... i kinda wanted you to take me .
let &apos;s go ! chop , chop !
seriously ? &quot; chop , chop &quot; ?
oh , right .
ohh ! what ?
what is this ?
mom ?
luke !
what are you doing ? !
i was dropping off your science project .
not to my locker !
when are you ever gonna stop embarrassing me ?
five more years .
five more years .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
if you &apos;re gonna go any higher ,
maybe i should put this down , huh ?
so ? what do you think ?
finally , a store that sells shirts
men actually wanna wear .
thank you . look , holla if you need me .
we &apos;re a little shorthanded today .
what happened to j &apos;marcus ?
don &apos;t ask . she &apos;s a j &apos;mess .
i &apos;m telling you , it is so hard to find someone
who knows clothes and is good with people .
well , i wish i knew somebody .
oh , my god . wait a second . cam ?
you wouldn &apos;t think about taking the job , would you ?
do you realize how perfect you &apos;d be ?
well , yes . um , but i @-@ i--
you &apos;d only work part @-@ time .
you &apos;ll get employee discounts on the clothes .
stop me if i &apos;m wasting my breath .
well , i don &apos;t know . what do you think , mitchell ?
well , i @-@ i would miss having you around the house ,
but , you know , if--if it &apos;s something that you love ...
mulling .
you know what ? it was nice of you to offer ,
but he should probably think about it .
i &apos;ll do it !
really ?
yep . just until he can find somebody to replace me ,
and good luck with that .
oh , and i don &apos;t fold .
longe , i &apos;m getting a protein shake .
okay . mitchell , this is jeoux .
hi . oh , just &quot; joe &quot; ?
yes , jeoux . j @-@ e @-@ o @-@ u @-@ x .
there it is .
oh , is this the mitchell you &apos;re helping out
because he wants his boyfriend to get a job ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing . should i wave ?
did your boyfriend take the job ?
oh , my god ! that looks so good on you , cam !
don &apos;t even .
it is everything i can do to not create a scene right now .
you will pay for this . mnh .
and this .
and this .
manny , you don &apos;t seem so happy .
you usually love
when i pull you out of school to play hockey .
&quot; a , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; hooky , &quot;
and &quot; b , &quot; don &apos;t ever take me out of school to play hockey .
did something bad happen at school ?
they fired the music teacher .
mr. hideo namagachi ?
that you say perfectly .
manny , don &apos;t worry . he &apos;ll find another job .
what about me ?
i &apos;ve been buttering up mr. namagachi for years .
he was gonna give me the lead in the school musical ,
&quot; oliver ! &quot;
is it not all over .
&quot; oliver ! &quot;
manny ...
you are a very talented boy .
you &apos;re gonna find plenty of music teachers
to put butter on .
but what if i can &apos;t ? i don &apos;t want
to spend my last year of middle school in the chorus .
maybe i can help .
maybe when they pick the new music teacher ,
i &apos;ll go and i &apos;ll flirt a little bit with him .
hey , mom , since we &apos;re just talking here ,
about your shirt .
uh-- what about my shirt ?
nothing .
i just noticed you got some , uh ,
some pizza ... on the ice cream on it .
ah , a little piece of-- mm .
it &apos;s natural to want to know the sex .
and there &apos;s practical matters-- how you paint the nursery .
gloria should--
phil , would you please knock that off ?
what ?
what &apos;s the matter ? are you nervous ?
i &apos;m not nervous .
may @-@ maybe you &apos;re the one who &apos;s nervous .
you ever think about that ?
okay .
&quot; nervous . &quot;
because if you &apos;ve had a change of heart ...
i haven &apos;t had a change of heart .
maybe you had a change of heart , but i &apos;m totally pumped .
pump , pump , pumped .
pump up the jam in my pumped @-@ up ... kicks .
pumpty @-@ dumpty . pumplestiltskin .
because they do this kind of thing all the time ,
and in about an hour ,
you &apos;re gonna be wanting to ride a horse .
mr. dunphy , can you please come to the desk ?
what &apos;s the plan , phil ?
just sit here . i &apos;m just gonna sit--
i &apos;m gonna sit a bit . sitting pretty .
is there a phil dunphy here ?
i &apos;m his father @-@ in @-@ law . he &apos;s gonna need a moment .
is there anything i could fill out for him ?
not unless you want the vasectomy .
where were you six months ago ?
barbados . now i really need to speak with the patient .
got it . phil , get over here .
phil ?
he just ran ou--
you know what could do wonders for your business here ?
a recovery room .
okay , wait , wait . i &apos;m not sure about this .
don &apos;t be a baby .
it &apos;s gonna look cool . just hold still .
mom , what are you doing here ?
i am changing my shirt . why aren &apos;t you at school ?
mrs. dunphy , we just--
oh , no , you don &apos;t get to talk , morticia .
okay , we cut last period-- big deal--
because we &apos;re shaving the backs of our necks ,
which is totally a style .
but of course now you &apos;re going to freak out
like you always do about every little thing .
let &apos;s do it .
what ?
yeah . yeah . let &apos;s shave up some heads .
come on . who &apos;s first ?
uh , okay . okay , mom , we-- we don &apos;t need you to do that .
are you afraid ?
i &apos;m not afraid !
then let &apos;s do this . it &apos;s shaving time .
shavy gravy . shaved by the bell .
why are you talking like dad ?
hair up , girls !
let &apos;s see some napes . come on . let &apos;s--
oh , god . no !
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
what did you do ? !
what did you do ? i have my sister &apos;s wedding on saturday !
i &apos;m so sorry .
uh , skylar , wait !
i could--i could-- i could even that up for you .
stay away from me , both of you !
uhh ! you ruined my life !
skylar !
cam .
cameron ! ohh ! you &apos;re gonna have to talk to me at some point !
oh , well , let me put that on my list of things to do ,
right after &quot; get a job . &quot;
would you stop running away ?
nope .
c @-@ cam ! come on !
you know , i can barely catch up with you
now that you lost all that weight .
you know what ? i am sleeping better ,
and i do have more energy-- oh , you know what ? you &apos;re good .
you &apos;re very good .
cam , the only reason i tried to get you that job
is because you &apos;ve been seeming a little ... unfulfilled .
oh , what , and you thought you &apos;d fix me
by turning me into some common shopgirl ?
you &apos;re not going anywhere . we have a daughter .
it &apos;s not for me . it &apos;s for you .
cam , i &apos;m not go-- okay , well , that &apos;s packed .
yeah , and if you &apos;re going someplace cool ,
i have a winter one packed as well .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere !
and i should be able to talk to you about these things .
oh , what things ?
how empty my life is ?
you know , you have no idea what i do
around this house every day . i shop for food ,
i pay the bills , i maintain the house ,
i grocery shop .
same as shopping for food .
and still i have enough time to work on my master project .
and you never ask me what my master project is .
because you told me not to ask !
fine , since you won &apos;t let it go ...
does this ...
look like the work of an unfulfilled slacker ?
a mermaid costume ?
hand @-@ sewn from my own design .
have you ever stitched lycra ?
it &apos;s like sewing water , mitchell .
it looks a little small for lily .
it &apos;s not for lily .
it &apos;s for the cat .
it &apos;s a mermaid costume for the cat .
my master project .
it &apos;s a mermaid costume ...
for a cat !
okay . hey , don &apos;t cry , okay ?
no , no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s nice . it &apos;s--
it &apos;s a very nice cat costume .
oh , stop it !
this is eight weeks of my life !
my--my stupid , empty , creepy ,
useless cat @-@ dressing life .
let me get you a tissue , all right ?
here .
okay .
oh ! you packed me tissues .
i know how you are with your allergies .
cam ! you know i don &apos;t think you &apos;re lazy .
i know . that &apos;s just stupid dad stuff .
you know , i didn &apos;t like working on the farm ,
and he just took it as me being lazy .
the truth is , is i am unfulfilled .
and i do need to find something .
well , you just--you seem happier when you have a challenge .
you know ?
i know , i know .
you know , i loved teaching music to kids ,
and then--then lily , she came along , and ...
that &apos;s the best job in the whole wide world .
you know ? and now she doesn &apos;t need me as much .
no , come on , come on .
we &apos;re gonna find you something else , all right ?
and it doesn &apos;t have to be longinus .
or this .
yeah .
you know , i do like these shirts .
yeah . yeah .
mulling .
okay .
you know , if i &apos;m gonna mull ,
i could really use some chocolate .
well , since your diet , we don &apos;t keep it around the house .
side pocket .
yeah ? oh .
remind me to replace these .
okay .
oh . hey , jay ! how you doing ?
phil , you gotta stop running from things because--
running ? i &apos;m not running .
you &apos;re running .
look , i &apos;m not up for another round with this .
just get in the damn car ! i &apos;m not having a great day !
you &apos;re not having a great day ? !
are you about to get spayed like a common schnauzer ? !
they don &apos;t spay you , they fix you . you &apos;re a man !
i just want to stay one !
phil , what &apos;s scaring you here ?
that people are gonna think less of you as a man ?
no , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s gonna hurt .
that &apos;s what this is about ?
wait , people think that ?
that you &apos;re less of a man ?
that never even occurred to me .
look , no one &apos;s gonna think less of you .
and it hardly even hurts .
i &apos;m unusually sensitive down there .
i can &apos;t go in certain jacuzzis .
i &apos;m gonna be with you the entire way .
plus it &apos;s the fear of pain
that &apos;s always more than the actual experience .
that &apos;s easy for you to say . you &apos;re not afraid of anything .
of course i &apos;m afraid of stuff .
like what ?
look ...
you remember before , when i told you i was
wanting to know the-- the sex of the baby ...
for practical matters ? well , that wasn &apos;t true .
i &apos;m kind of afraid of having a girl .
give me a break . that &apos;s not a thing .
you &apos;d just rather have a boy .
everyone would rather have a boy .
no . i &apos;m actually scared . i get boys .
it &apos;s girls-- they &apos;re--they &apos;re complicated .
half of claire &apos;s childhood , i did everything i could
to try to turn her into a boy .
well , whatever your issues were ,
you and claire are good now .
yeah , but i may not get that kind of time
with this new one , and i can &apos;t screw it up .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m sensitive enough to raise a girl .
jay , you &apos;re being sensitive right now .
i mean , i was pretty hysterical , and you calmed me down .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think you &apos;re the guy you used to be .
so you &apos;re saying that if i can deal with you ,
then i can handle ... any other little girl ?
i think i &apos;d put it a @-@ a little differently .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i think that &apos;s right .
thanks .
we gonna do this ?
promise it &apos;s not gonna hurt that much ?
tiny , little pinch .
i built it up in my head , didn &apos;t i ?
totally .
and i can still achieve a @-@ a full and satisfying ...
you know what ? we had a nice little moment here .
we don &apos;t have many of those .
i think i &apos;m gonna commemorate it .
okay .
all right ?
so sit up straight .
there you go .
no , no , the arms down . uh , better arms down .
all right . yeah , yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s right . relax .
there you go .
perfect .
can i get a copy ?
oh , there &apos;ll be a lot of copies .
oh , great .
you were kind of hard on that cinnamon bun guy .
did you hear what he said to me ?
&quot; congratulations &quot; ?
he thinks i &apos;m pregnant !
that is an insult when the person doesn &apos;t look it .
mom , wait .
you need to hear this .
you are pregnant , and you look it .
i hope that this new one has some good manners !
mom , stop !
i know this whole thing is a little scary for you .
last time you were pregnant , you kinda did it alone
&apos;cause dad wasn &apos;t around much .
but this time you have two partners .
that &apos;s sweet .
and so are you .
especially with a little bit of sugar in your face .
let me see .
ohh ! what happened ? !
your shirt couldn &apos;t take it anymore !
the stupid dry cleaners !
w-- where is it ? !
ay , no !
oh ! you &apos;re running out of arms , mom !
a maternity store &apos;s right over there !
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know , but let &apos;s go !
it &apos;s you . i thought it was the guy coming to shave me .
oh , good . they haven &apos;t started .
he had a little piece of bloody toilet paper on his neck .
it was disconcerting .
are you okay ?
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah . i had a pretty crazy day ,
but it--it had an interesting ending .
and this tortoise was 200 years old .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m boring you with my trip .
no , not at all .
you hot @-@ air @-@ ballooned over an active volcano .
three weeks ago i made every green light on jefferson .
couldn &apos;t stop talking about it .
you e @-@ mailed me .
oh , god .
mom shaved skylar &apos;s head ? that &apos;s hilarious !
it &apos;s not gonna be so fun the next time she bothers to show up for school
what do you care ? you know you don &apos;t even like her .
i don &apos;t . skylar &apos;s awful .
mom actually did me a huge favor .
oh , my god . do not tell her that .
she will never shut up .
i know . remember when you admitted that you didn &apos;t hate
that james taylor concert she dragged you to ?
she was unbearable ! &quot; i told you !
he &apos;s got the voice of an angel ! &quot;
she &apos;s such a nerd .
i kind of miss her , though .
you know , honey , i don &apos;t want to do this
unless you are really ready .
i am ready .
i don &apos;t know if i am .
me , either .
you wanna wait ?
five more years ?
i &apos;ve always seen life like a series of doors .
sometimes you get to choose the door you go through ,
sometimes you don &apos;t get that choice .
but you still gotta walk through .
so you can either go kicking and screaming ...
or walk through with your head held high .
and since i don &apos;t get to choose the door i &apos;m about to go through ,
i just pray it &apos;s a healthy , happy kid .
and a boy .
honey , look what manny just sent me .
hang on one sec . okay .
is that the funniest thing ever ?
oh , yeah !
oh ... oh , my gosh . mitchell , come here .
you have to see what claire sent us .
okay , wait . one--one second .
okay .
is that hilarious ?
that &apos;s great !
oh , phil !
ay , this is embarrassing .
i don &apos;t know how comfortable i am
