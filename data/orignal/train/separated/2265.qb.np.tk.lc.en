第十集
she wants it to be just the three of us .
her perfect family .
anna and elsa must know the truth !
we might not make it home , but this could .
i figured out your plan .
you want to cleave yourself from the dagger .
my mirror is complete .
i can finally cast a spell over all of storybrooke .
well done , dearie .
it appears you &apos;ve won .
that &apos;s big of you .
a welcome change . you &apos;re usually so confrontational .
i prefer reasonable .
i &apos;d like to make a deal .
you have nothing that i want .
well , perhaps i do .
this spell of yours , when it hits ...
in a few hours from now ?
sundown .
sundown . yeah .
it &apos;ll bring out the darkness in everyone in this town .
it &apos;ll do more than that .
they will tear themselves apart until everyone is dead .
not everyone .
you &apos;ll have what you want --
you alone with your &quot; sisters &quot; elsa and emma
doing who knows what ,
and i &apos;ll be here , too ,
spending every waking moment of my immortal life
trying to rip your heart out .
it seems you do have something to offer .
what do you want ?
to leave .
didn &apos;t we already make this deal ?
yes , but i have an eye for a loophole ,
and i think i &apos;ve spotted yours .
my wife and grandson will be destroyed by this spell ,
so i want you to allow them to leave with me .
you spare the two of them ,
i spare you misery .
do we have a deal ?
enjoy your trip .
belle was right . my aunt it actually doing this .
the spell of shattered sight .
we open the mines and the vault . we take shelter there .
this is magic . it doesn &apos;t care about ceilings .
it &apos;s started .
how long ?
by sundown .
by sundown , everyone in this town will start ...
tearing each other apart .
okay .
the answer is simple .
let &apos;s not be in town .
hardly an elegant solution .
nothing wrong with brute force if it works .
if we can get over , we can build a frame ,
take people over one at a time .
david , be careful .
you okay ?
david ?
looks like that wall doesn &apos;t care much for your brute force .
elsa ? no , stop . hey .
no ! that thing could go off again !
come on .
it &apos;s anna &apos;s necklace .
i thought it was gone .
it &apos;s like a miracle .
glad you found it ,
but sentimentality &apos;s not worth risking your life over .
it &apos;s a sign , emma -- a sign we &apos;re gonna win .
is everyone into this hope thing now ?
if we &apos;re gonna win , we need to stop wasting time .
mom , dad , leroy ,
go tell everyone what &apos;s going on .
when this goes down ,
everyone needs to be separated from their loved ones
if they don &apos;t want to hurt each other .
killian , go to the waterfront .
see if we can use boats to get some people out .
i have to warn robin hood . his camp &apos;s not far from here .
okay , go .
elsa and i are gonna talk to gold , see if he has any ideas .
henry , you come with us .
no .
he &apos;s with me . i &apos;m his best chance .
that might not be true .
emma and i ? i think we &apos;re immune .
what ?
these ribbons .
if the snow queen wants us to be her sisters ,
then the curse won &apos;t affect us .
so i should definitely watch henry .
no . you &apos;re part of this nut job &apos;s plan .
i want henry near me as long as it &apos;s safe for him .
it &apos;s okay , mom . i &apos;ll be fine with her .
be careful , kid .
we gotta go .
this is happening now .
any luck ?
no . it appears to be pretty much unstoppable .
the one thing i did find is there may be a way
to undo the effects from anyone it touches .
that &apos;s wonderful .
it seems that when somebody &apos;s been touched by the spell ,
that you can use them to undo it .
with a strand of their hair ,
you can make some kind of counterspell , like a vaccine .
my sister .
what ?
my aunt said she put me in that urn .
i didn &apos;t believe her because anna would never do that ,
unless she was under that spell .
we have to get to her .
but you -- you still don &apos;t know where she is .
no , but now you can help me find her .
you said if i had something of hers ,
you could use this locator spell .
well , now i have something of hers .
sometimes sentimentality pays off .
point elsa .
there &apos;s ...
mirror dust in this .
actually embedded in the metal .
so i was right . she was under that spell .
so if we find anna ,
she can save everyone .
i &apos;ll round up the fairies .
they can set up shop somewhere close
and figure out how to make the counterspell .
thank you . let &apos;s go .
elsa , you realize this is a long shot .
i was time traveling when i brought you here ,
and when anna disappeared , it was --
30 years ago . i know .
but she &apos;s okay . she has to be .
and i don &apos;t care how old she is . she can save us .
okay , then . we &apos;re relying on mirror dust and fairies ,
but w we have a plan , which is progress .
let &apos;s go find your sister .
holy cats ! that is cold .
ice is like that , i &apos;ve noticed .
the urn .
it was here . it &apos;s gone , and so is elsa and my aunt !
but i saw you with it .
well , now it &apos;s missing , and elsa is in it .
i just have to get her out , let her know i didn &apos;t mean it .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s straw .
gold straw .
rumplestiltskin . kristoff ...
my aunt doesn &apos;t have the urn . he does .
you are literally hanging a big assumption on a really thin straw .
but it makes sense .
he would never let someone walk off with something he valued .
i should &apos;ve known he &apos;d follow me .
and this is ... good news ?
don &apos;t worry .
we can get to him . we can handle him .
and even if we can &apos;t , we can figure out a way how to .
elsa is the only one who can rule arendelle .
um , i beg to differ .
what are you doing here ?
hearing you confess you attacked the reigning queen ,
and then lost her to another land --
that sounds like treason to me . doesn &apos;t it , guys ?
and i sang with you .
you &apos;re both under arrest ,
under my order as the new king of arendelle .
what ?
we were all frozen ,
but now that your sister &apos;s spell has worn off ,
no will will argue with a new benevolent leader such as myself .
it wasn &apos;t her .
as if anyone will believe that .
okay , you know what ?
you got us .
stop them !
no fleeing by boat then .
this snow queen is good , isn &apos;t she ?
sit , lad .
don &apos;t forget where your heart lies .
now i have a job for you .
you remember how this works .
the hat ? not emma .
no , no . not this time .
i have a better plan .
granny &apos;s diner is being converted into a temporary hive
for the vilest of creatures -- the pious little fleas .
pious ? the fairies ?
just like any flying pests ,
if you wanna eliminate the infestation ,
it &apos;s important to get them all .
doing so will infuse this hat with enough power
to allow me to cleave myself from the dagger
and then leave this town with my powers intact ,
a suddenly urgent undertaking . now will you assist me ?
you have my heart . you know i can &apos;t refuse .
indeed .
but here &apos;s the rub , dearie .
my wife has just called to inform me that she intends
to spend the day sequestered amongst said fleas .
so i need you to stand by
while i get her out of the way .
the fairies are working to stop the spell .
you &apos;re killing the cure ?
you do this , you condemn the entire town ,
and even your own grandson , to whatever happens .
no , i &apos;m not leaving henry .
i will take him and i will take belle
and i will leave this town to its fate .
but emma and everyone else ...
i don &apos;t have time for everyone else .
and if i have to choose between everyone else and me ...
&quot; me &quot; wins every time .
you can clench your jaw ...
and flash your eyes all you wish ,
because it doesn &apos;t change the fact ...
that we &apos;re in this together .
are you all right ? all right , sit down . tell me ...
what &apos;s this ? what is this called ?
an arrow .
yes . and where does this go ?
flight .
flight , yeah . stay right there .
regina .
it &apos;s happening .
you and your men need to scatter .
all together like this with all these weapons ?
you &apos;ll kill each other once the spell hits .
will ! will scarlet !
there &apos;s no need to yell . i &apos;m just here , robin .
emergency . break camp .
right then . come on , little man .
why don &apos;t you go help ?
what ?
is there something else ?
no . i &apos;m just trying to memorize you like this .
like what ? nervous and alarmed ?
no , with love in your eyes .
i told you what this spell is going to do .
maybe it won &apos;t .
it will .
the only people who believe in me in this town
are henry and you .
the thought of you looking at me
the way everyone else does , with -- with hatred ...
that just might kill me .
stop thinking .
we &apos;re here now ,
and this is true .
okay .
here you go .
is it supposed to do that ?
yeah . i know this spell .
it gets brighter as you get closer to your goal .
it &apos;s how my parents found each other .
did you see that ? that means it found her , right ?
she &apos;s out there ? - how about -- yeah .
come on . don &apos;t stand here . let &apos;s keep going .
the library ?
but i &apos;ve been inside before , and anna wasn &apos;t there .
the library &apos;s ... well , a funny place .
there are all these tunnels underneath .
you think she could be down there ?
regina kept a whole dragon under there for 28 years .
i &apos;m sure you can fit a small princess , too .
yes . frozen by the snow queen .
that &apos;s why we never found anna .
but now we will .
wait ! stop ! too much running !
okay .
i don &apos;t hear eight enormous feet , so i think we lost them .
great . so now we just need to get that urn back .
call me crazy , but i really don &apos;t want to face an evil wizard .
i never said &quot; evil . &quot;
i mean , he is , but ... oh ! i have a plan .
right before i left , i read mother &apos;s diary .
the one elsa found , looking for clues .
there was something they were looking for called a wishing star .
what &apos;s that ?
i have no idea .
but the important thing is , you can wish on it .
i &apos;m sure they were gonna use it to take elsa &apos;s power .
but maybe we can use it to wish elsa back to us .
well , obviously they never got it
because ... elsa ... powers ...
right . they tracked it to a pirate named blackbeard .
but there &apos;s no record they ever met with him ,
but we can .
so my choices are evil wizard or pirate ?
pirates are better than wizards .
says who ?
you can pay off pirates .
you and i are rich in many ways ,
but the thing we &apos;re richest in is riches .
so let &apos;s take the power of the royal treasury
and go buy ourselves a wishing thing .
we can use it to rescue elsa , and she can save arendelle .
it &apos;s brighter .
there .
there !
what ?
no . how can there be a barrier ? look how bright the glow is .
she must be practically right on the other side .
anna , are you there ?
look at this dust . it just recently fell .
all the new ice spiking and earth shaking
that the snow queen &apos;s been doing must &apos;ve caused it .
i can move this .
no , elsa , stop .
as much as i enjoyed our last cave @-@ in ,
i don &apos;t wanna do it again .
but she &apos;s right there !
then we &apos;ll find another way .
that was the slowest boat ride ever .
that must be blackbeard &apos;s ship .
okay , now we need to find a crewman
and tell him we wanna meet with blackbeard
because he has something we &apos;re willing to pay anything for .
right .
someone is playing my song .
i &apos;m captain blackbeard .
come onboard .
i &apos;m trying to find my sister ,
and you have a certain sculpture that can help me do that .
and -- and we wanna buy it .
sculpture ?
the wishing star ?
ah , yes .
the wishing star .
for the right price , it &apos;s yours .
and -- and what is the right price ?
my weight in gold .
so ...
if it &apos;s not delicate , how much ... tonnage ?
what would you say you weigh , sir ?
oh , never mind . it &apos;s fine .
sold ! i mean , bought .
see ? look , things are going so nicely .
i told you if we just keep the faith ,
everything &apos;s gonna work out .
and i told you that pirates were easier to deal with than wizards .
hey , i told you that .
and no one asked me at all .
he did it again .
sure , me and the guys can clear the tunnel .
we &apos;ll have to work careful , but we can do it .
let &apos;s go now .
excuse me .
look at this mess .
a good mayor checks that these things are kept up to code .
yeah , well , if the mayor
only has to worry about one villain , and it &apos;s herself ,
that frees up a lot of time for infrastructure .
i &apos;ve had other issues .
leroy , how long to clear the passage ?
couple of hours , maybe . we can get right on it .
that &apos;s wonderful .
we don &apos;t have a couple hours .
have you guys not been watching the clock ?
it &apos;ll be sundown before you munchkins finish .
dwarfs , sister .
like i care .
let &apos;s just blast through and take the risk .
that was belle over at the diner .
it turns out they can possibly make the counterspell
even if we don &apos;t find anna .
they can pull the mirror dust out of the necklace
and try to use that .
it &apos;s exactly the same ?
almost . it &apos;ll take a little longer .
the process is difficult and ...
it will destroy the necklace .
so the necklace can either save all of us or anna .
no . it can do both . we have time .
we don &apos;t .
exploring these tunnels could take days .
so what &apos;ll it be , folks ?
save the town or find the sister ?
go around the back and wait .
you &apos;ll know when you &apos;re needed .
what do you want ?
excuse me , but i &apos;d like to borrow my wife .
i need her at the shop for a short while .
she &apos;s working . we need her .
mother superior &apos;s right .
this is too important .
we really closed here .
rumple , please . please be patient .
of course .
well , until you can go , i &apos;ll just , uh ...
i &apos;ll just keep you company .
perhaps i &apos;ll be helpful .
this is light magic , dark one .
well , then maybe i &apos;ll learn something .
this shouldn &apos;t even be a conversation .
if we don &apos;t get the necklace to the fairies right now ,
we and all our loved ones will be hit by this vicious spell .
it &apos;s one woman &apos;s life versus a whole town .
maybe we just haven &apos;t found an option
where we don &apos;t have to lose anyone .
mm , you &apos;re talking like a hero .
yes , like all you charmings always do .
but right now that &apos;s not your job .
you &apos;re more than heroes .
you &apos;re leaders ,
which means making the tough choice
where someone has to lose , and you have to say who .
i agree with regina . you &apos;re right .
yeah , i heard it , too .
we need to do what &apos;s best for the most people .
we need to give this town its best chance .
i &apos;m so sorry ,
but we have to let the fairies destroy that necklace .
this can &apos;t be easy .
the necklace . do you have it ?
it &apos;s right here .
it &apos;s pebbles from the mine .
what ?
where is it ?
she tricked us so she can use it ...
to keep tracking down her damn sister !
i should know better than to trust blondes by now .
we should go back and get it .
no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s too late .
too late ? already ? !
by the time you get back here , yes .
without anna being here physically ,
there &apos;s no way to make a counterspell in time .
time for a hope speech ?
virtues of blind faith ?
well , it seems elsa &apos;s blind faith is exactly
what &apos;s screwing us right now .
coming from you , that &apos;s just terrifying .
well , i &apos;m not giving up .
i know she &apos;s down in the mines looking for anna .
i &apos;m gonna go help elsa find her .
well , then go , because right now that &apos;s our only shot .
elsa !
i &apos;m sorry ! i have to try this !
the beach ? that map couldn &apos;t have been any more wrong .
i don &apos;t understand . she should be here .
elsa , i &apos;m sorry . magic isn &apos;t always perfect .
so even though it &apos;s still glowing ,
because she &apos;s not here , it means ...
the search is over .
30 years is a long time .
you think something &apos;s happened to her ,
and this has all been a mistake ?
i think we need to deal with the problem in front of us right now .
i &apos;m sorry .
how do you keep doing that ?
you didn &apos;t exactly leave inconspicuously .
a paid informant on the docks in arendelle
and the swiftest ship in the navy got us here
just in time .
this was a trap ?
we have a deal ! something about ...
what , well over 200 pounds of gold .
you know , when you &apos;re angry ,
you look so much like your mother .
wait .
you met my mother ?
and your dear papa as well .
a very regal couple .
the fact they thought i wouldn &apos;t recognize royalty
was charmingly naive of them .
honestly , i liked them .
sold them the star at cost , actually .
the wishing star ?
that doesn &apos;t make sense . if they had it ,
they would &apos;ve used it to take away elsa &apos;s magic .
oh , well , perhaps they didn &apos;t know
that the wishing star can only be used by those with ...
pure hearts .
well , if there &apos;s another one , we &apos;re still interested ,
and we can pay just as much as he can .
can you ?
because my brothers and i spent wednesday
rolling around on the money in the royal treasury .
you rolled around in gold bars ?
weird . and ouch .
figure of speech . we reveled in it .
the point is , it &apos;s now in my control , not yours .
you &apos;re what they call penniless .
but , uh , that doesn &apos;t matter ,
because where you &apos;re going , you don &apos;t need money .
where is that ?
death .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a place .
well , you &apos;re both about to find out .
this is the treacherous area known as poseidon &apos;s boneyard --
the exact spot where your parents &apos; ship went down .
how fitting that mother and daughter
will have their last regrets in the same place .
will you both die ,
wishing you &apos;d never tried to help your freak sister ?
well ...
maybe your bones will mingle with your mother &apos;s
on the bottom of the sea .
bring forward the trunk !
there &apos;s a trunk ?
how -- how will their bones mingle if she &apos;s in a trunk ?
i once had a rival who made me walk the plank .
and much to my surprise , i was saved by a mermaid .
i applied the lesson .
this trunk will make sure you die without &quot; finterference . &quot;
elsa &apos;s gonna get out of that urn ,
and when she does , she &apos;s gonna take back the kingdom
and kick you and your brothers back to the southern isles ,
which sounds lovelier than i bet it actually is .
i doubt that .
i control the royal navy ,
the vast armies ,
and even this enchanted ship you &apos;re about to be thrown off --
the jolly roger .
and if elsa hasn &apos;t found a way to escape an urn in the last 30 years ,
i doubt she ever will .
wait . what ? 30 years ?
the spell that froze arendelle ,
it had us all frozen for 30 years .
my aunt kept us like that for decades ?
elsa . my poor sister .
she was stuck in an urn all that time !
why would ingrid unfreeze us all right now ?
because she wants to do something worse .
we have to get to elsa .
we have to stop whatever it is ingrid -- aah !
she &apos;s so talky .
men !
i &apos;m sorry , emma , but i still have faith .
i still believe she &apos;s ...
what ?
it stopped glowing .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s really gone .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
there &apos;s a nail back there .
okay , i think i can get through the ropes .
help !
help !
this was my present for anna for her wedding .
it was among my mother &apos;s things ,
but to us , it was new .
and i turned it into the last gift i ever gave her .
elsa , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but it &apos;s almost sundown .
that cloud is gonna hit any time .
we have to go . everyone &apos;s gonna turn on each other ,
and something tells me that being immune to the curse
is not gonna stop them from attacking us .
i failed . i deserve to be attacked .
this ...
this is all i have left of anna .
now i &apos;ll never know what happened to her .
come on . come on !
oh , come on !
oh ! look ! look !
i got my hands out . okay , i &apos;m gonna untie you . all right ?
okay , come here . come on .
okay .
okay , come here . come here .
i , anna of arendelle ,
promise to love and cherish you .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . what are you doing ?
marrying you before we die .
no .
what ?
you don &apos;t get to marry me unless we get out of this .
okay ? just keep your chin up and breathe . okay ?
anna , wherever you are ,
whatever happened to you all those years ago ,
i &apos;m so sorry i didn &apos;t find you .
i still have faith . i know you &apos;re out there somewhere .
i won &apos;t give up hope .
i just wish ...
i wish you were with me now .
elsa , come on .
something &apos;s happening .
do you think it &apos;s my aunt &apos;s spell ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on .
come on . come on . come on .
i love you .
i love you , too .
what is that ?
anna ?
anna !
elsa !
anna ! oh ! i couldn &apos;t find you !
i was looking for you !
i put you in an urn !
you missed your wedding !
it &apos;s okay ! we &apos;re here !
but you &apos;re still young !
we were frozen !
for 30 years , apparently .
how did this happen ? !
how did you get here ? !
it &apos;s like you wished it .
my necklace .
it was the wishing star !
this is an amazing miracle .
but it is a cold miracle , and we &apos;re all wet , so ...
yes . if we can get anna back to the fairies right away ,
she might be able to stop the spell .
wait . there &apos;s something i have to do first .
so anna &apos;s on her way .
do you really think they can do it ?
well , perhaps . but , uh ,
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned ,
it &apos;s never trust a fairy .
come . let &apos;s get you someplace safe ...
just in case .
so this spell can &apos;t affect anna
because it already got her once ?
exactly .
and the two of you ?
we &apos;re immune . it &apos;s a long story . we --
we just gotta hurry .
what a funny @-@ looking world .
right ?
i &apos;m sorry . i truly am .
what happened here ?
what do you think ? the snow queen .
what does this mean ?
it means that even with you here ,
we can &apos;t protect everyone .
so what do we do now ?
prepare for the worst .
you &apos;ll be safe in here .
so you -- you can keep the spell out ?
no , but we must be separated .
as dark one , i may be immune to the spell ,
but you can still hurt me .
go inside and stay in the back room .
i &apos;m gonna seal it with a protection spell
so no one can get to you .
okay .
look , i @-@ i &apos;ll be back soon ,
and then we &apos;re gonna be together
and we &apos;re gonna be fine .
i promise .
is it done ?
you know , she truly loves you .
you could have her forever ,
or all the power in the world .
it &apos;s your choice .
i don &apos;t need to choose , thank you .
i can and will have both .
now that it &apos;s settled , are we done ?
no , no .
i &apos;m not gonna give up control of you just yet ,
not until i have everything i need .
what &apos;s left ?
that &apos;s my concern , not yours .
but by morning , all should be complete ,
including your life .
now run along , dearie ,
and enjoy your last day in this or any land .
mom , dad , we &apos;re running out of time .
you said you had a plan .
kristoff ?
david ?
you cut your hair .
so did you you !
i see you brought your lovely fiancee . joan ?
joan ?
it was a ... code name .
david , i like you short hair .
not that i didn &apos;t like it long or that i thought it was ...
it &apos;s good to see you .
likewise .
this is my wife snow , our son neal , and
our daughter emma .
wait . what ? how can she be your daughter ?
it &apos;s a long story . once we survive this curse ,
i &apos;ll be happy to tell you all about it .
the plan . what &apos;s the plan ?
this is the plan .
what ?
you and anna and elsa are the only ones immune ,
so the rest of us need to protect ourselves .
you might wanna try that desk , old friend .
it &apos;s sturdy . cuff keys are in the top drawer .
i &apos;m not locking you in there .
yes , you have to .
we won &apos;t be able to hurt anyone from in here .
take the keys , emma .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen .
i don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s gonna last .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen to me .
i mean , what if -- what if you starve to death in there ?
no , emma , you &apos;re gonna fix this thing ,
and then you &apos;re gonna come back and save us .
you think ?
we believe in you .
please .
now you know henry &apos;s in a safe place ,
and regina and the others can take care of themselves .
what about the baby ?
no , don &apos;t worry . neal won &apos;t be with us .
who &apos;s gonna take him ?
you are .
we don &apos;t fear your magic , emma .
it &apos;s what &apos;s gonna allow you to take on the snow queen and win .
and when you do , you &apos;ll be right back here
unlocking these doors .
we trust you .
and henry &apos;s right . you are special ,
and you are going to use that specialness
and save us , both of you .
you have wonderful parents , emma .
i know .
swan ? a word .
elsa , can you hold my brother ?
yes , of course .
it &apos;s okay .
what are you doing here ?
you know what &apos;s about to happen .
aye .
i know . i just needed to see you .
before i chained myself to the dock
for the protection of all , i ...
needed to see you one more time .
killian , i &apos;m not ... a tearful goodbye kiss person .
but maybe just this once .
goodbye .
okay .
not long now .
looks like one more adventure together .
here it comes .
henry , i am so sorry .
i should have stayed focused on operation mongoose , but ...
robin hood ...
i @-@ i let my heart pull me elsewhere .
operation mongoose is not over .
we &apos;re gonna find the author . you will be happy .
first , we have to survive .
now listen to me carefully , henry .
i &apos;m going to seal this place .
you &apos;re going to be locked in , but more importantly ,
everyone else will be locked out .
i understand .
don &apos;t be scared .
i &apos;m not , mom .
emma and elsa will fix this . i have faith .
i wish i was as brave as you .
now go .
i &apos;ll be okay .

i love you .
i love you , too .
where to now ?
my vault .
and you need to get as far away from it as possible .
it &apos;s dangerous even being around each other now .
we &apos;re moments away .
it &apos;s okay .
roland and marian are locked away
somewhere even i don &apos;t know .
henry is safe in there .
i &apos;ll go and chain myself to a tree in a minute ...
unless you want me to come with you .
no , no , no , no , no .
i need to seal myself in that vault .
to keep people out ?
oh , no .
to keep me in .
regina , i &apos;m not afraid of you .
but you really ...
really should be .
never let go .
hey . don &apos;t be afraid .
you know , we share a heart ,
and nothing can come between two halves of one heart .
these are just precautions .
