growing up in the &apos; 80s ,
i didn &apos;t just love movies-- i lived them .
maybe a little too much .
hey , little buddy .
hey , barry . you want to be in my movie ?
i &apos;d love nothing more .
okay , so i &apos;m inside the game grid ,
and i have these identity discs , and you &apos;re gonna ...
that &apos;s a wrap , nerd .
i had no kids on my street to play with ,
and my older siblings weren &apos;t exactly interested
in my hobbies .
yo .
yo .
whatcha up to ?
nothin &apos; .
&apos;cause it looks like you were filming yourself
on a &quot; tron &quot; light cycle escaping the game grid .
you &apos;ve seen &quot; tron . &quot;
16 times .
my mom &apos;s actually kinda worried .
hi , i &apos;m adam .
i &apos;m chad ... kremp .
we just moved in across the street .
you wanna check out my light cycle ?
sure . yeah .
and just like that , i had a new neighbor and best friend .
even though we had so much in common ,
our families couldn &apos;t have been more different .
the kremps were soft @-@ spoken ...
hi . can chad play ?
chad , honey , your friend is here .
and the goldbergs liked to yell .
hi . can adam play ?
adam ! get your ass down here !
the kremps owned a fancy flower shop ...
here , adam .
why don &apos;t you take these home to your mother ?
why ?
the goldbergs owned a discount furniture store .
hey ... get off the furniture !
i gotta sell this crap .
this was a typical saturday afternoon at the kremps &apos; ...
put a little pepper on that one , didn &apos;t you , son ?
i learned from the best .
hey , lemonade for my home team .
while a saturday afternoon at the goldbergs&apos;
looked more like this ...
what the hell ? barry goldberg ,
you get your butt out of that tree right now !
what kind of moron gets stuck in a tree ?
adam said i couldn &apos;t climb this high .
i showed him !
you sure did .
if you don &apos;t come down right now ,
i am gonna go get the hose !
you &apos;re not gonna spray our son .
stop !
erica--
enough with the ball !
the hose is the way to go .
um , he &apos;s the idiot that got himself stuck up there .
i &apos;ll try and catch him--
hey , neighbors ! hi !
we have got to get that barbecue on the books , don &apos;t we ?
definitely .
that &apos;d be great .
he &apos;s a moron !
he is !
hi !
and that &apos;s what you &apos;d call &quot; a goldberg first impression . &quot;
long before cell phones ,
you only had one phone line ...
and it was the source of all problems .
get off the phone . get off the phone .
hold on , lainey .
get off the phone .
i &apos;m talking !
go away , or i &apos;ll punch you in the soft part of your skull .
mom told you not to punch me there .
now give me the phone . i got an important call to make .
really ? what &apos;s so important ?
i gotta call roger .
he borrowed my hockey stick ,
and i found a hornet &apos;s nest out back .
your life is so sad and simple .
go .
no . get off the phone .
get off the phone . get off the phone--
hey , you know ...
when i was your age , i was a radio man
with the 103rd , working with the french and the british .
we shared one line ,
and we still managed to win the war .
can you please stop with these stories ?
this is a real life situation here .
dad , we gotta get a second phone line .
two phone lines ?
what does this look like-- the white house ?
a second line-- is that even possible
with all those wires crossing in and out ?
can they even do that ?
while pops couldn &apos;t understand how the phone worked ,
my mom couldn &apos;t understand why the kremps
kept ducking her barbecue invitation .
this is getting ridiculous .
i have been nothing but nice to the kremps ...
and they &apos;re clearly blowing us off .
i mean , why would they want to avoid us ?
what did you do ?
what ?
you heard me . what ... did you do ?
i haven &apos;t said a word to those people .
well , that &apos;s the problem right there .
you &apos;re not friendly , you don &apos;t say &quot; hi , &quot;
you water the yard in your underpants .
it &apos;s disconcerting .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re trying to drive people away .
that &apos;s because i am trying to drive people away .
well , that is why you have no friends , murray .
i live in a house full of people
who won &apos;t leave me the hell alone .
that &apos;s all the friends i need .
well , you may not want friends , but i do .
go over there and apologize
for being a pantsless grumpy pants .
i should apologize for being me ?
yes !
hi . i &apos;m , uh , murray goldberg from across the street .
just thought i &apos;d come over and formally introduce myself .
charles kremp . pleasure to meet you .
come on in .
oh , okay . thank you .
this place smells great !
it &apos;s the gardenias .
it &apos;s a perk of the job . i &apos;m a florist .
oh , how about that ?
that &apos;s right .
we have a @-@ a flower spray that we keep in the bathroom .
it tries .
but the point is ,
i am here to invite you to a barbecue .
yes , that ... that situation .
so ... it is a situation , huh ?
from now on ,
i will try and , uh ,
wear pants when i go outside .
try .
to be honest , um ... my--my wife virginia--
she can be a little sensitive ,
and , uh ...
how to put this-- your wife scares her .
what ?
that day , my father finally got to do something
he had been waiting for since the day he got married--
be right !
it &apos;s you !
what ?
you heard me .
it &apos;s not me that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s you !
what did i do ?
oh ... you scare the woman .
scare her but good .
that is ridiculous .
i have never been anything but cordial to her .
how can she not like me ?
you yell . uh , you yell inside , you yell outside .
and apparently , you climbed up on a garbage truck
to yell at the garbage man .
and he drove halfway down the block
with you hanging off the back .
and then he drove back and picked up our old sink .
you &apos;re welcome .
explain it any way you want to , bevy .
that woman no likey you .
but the idea of someone not liking my mom
was not gonna fly .
beverly goldberg prided herself on
being loved by all .
and she couldn &apos;t have it any other way .
whoo @-@ hoo ! virginia !
she turned power walking into power stalking .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
oh . i didn &apos;t know you power walked .
what a coincidence .
i do it every day .
she didn &apos;t .
well , i should ... keep moving .
i just hit my peak burn period . so--
oh , good stuff ,
good stuff . listen ...
i feel like we got off on the wrong foot ,
and i know we &apos;re gonna be great friends .
so please , come over for a barbecue .
sure .
sure , i &apos;ll let you know .
now ? okay , uh , how about saturday ?
i think it &apos;s supposed to rain on saturday .
great , saturday it is . mark it down .
you don &apos;t have to bring anything
except an open mind and four sides .
no . just one side , if you want .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna keep moving .
okay , i &apos;ll lead .
oh ! aah ! cramp , cramp , cramp .
okay , saturday it is . prepare to make some memories .
while my mom was trying to make a connection
with mrs. kremp ...
my brother was hoping to make a connection of his own .
hey , there , big boy .
you &apos;ve reached 9 @-@ 7 @-@ 6 @-@ fox .
i &apos;m glad you called .
to speak with a hot girl in a car--press one .
to speak with a nasty girl on a plane--press two .
what the ... hello ?
hang up .
hang up !
hang up !
seriously , you &apos;re calling 9 @-@ 7 @-@ 6 numbers ?
that &apos;s a personal call with a friend !
gimme that .
you &apos;ve selected erotic boat ride .
oh , man .
you are so busted .
don &apos;t tell dad , please ?
i &apos;ll do anything .
i &apos;ll give you one week of uninterrupted phone time .
hmm , that &apos;s hard to pass up .
dad ! barry &apos;s calling 9 @-@ 7 @-@ 6 numbers !
what ? !
those calls are like $ 5.99 a minute .
the first two minutes are free ,
and i never go beyond the second minute .
i use the timer from boggle .
it &apos;s legit .
oh , you want legit ?
no phone for a month !
what ? !
this is your fault !
how is it my fault that you want to
get frisky in a rowboat ?
that wasn &apos;t the selection i was gonna make .
okay , now you &apos;re in trouble .
your son has been calling smut numbers .
i don &apos;t care . i have something very important to tell you .
the kremps are coming over for a barbecue .
yes ! that is big !
now let &apos;s focus on this and not my thing .
tell us more about this important barbecue .
wait , are we talking about all the kremps here ,
like , the boys , too--
the one that &apos;s adam &apos;s age , and the one that &apos;s my age
with sandy brown hair and blue eyes ?
you still want to have a barbecue with these people ,
even though that woman &apos;s terrified of you ?
not anymore .
i woke up early this morning ,
followed her for 2 miles on foot ,
then chased her down and convinced her
there &apos;s nothing scary about me .
come on . i had nothing planned this weekend .
it was perfect .
well , now you do . and you will be warm
and inviting , and so help me god ,
you better not fall asleep in front of these people .
okay ! let &apos;s get cookin &apos; !
off . take it off .
it &apos;s an icebreaker ...
sometimes more .
dad , these are good people .
we need to be on our best behavior .
that means no dirty jokes , no limericks , no lewd comments .
this party sounds like a real drag .
as for the rest of you ,
no yelling , no cursing , no fighting .
mark my words .
this will be the best backyard barbecue
in the history ... of backyard barbecues .
or not .
it was gonna be a very stormy weekend with the kremps .
even though it rained during the big barbecue ,
it didn &apos;t stop me and chad
from reciting &quot; empire strikes back &quot; by heart .
no , no , that &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s impossible .
it also didn &apos;t stop my sister from warming up to drew kremp ,
or my dad from falling asleep ,
or my mom from trying to get virginia
to warm up to her .
i brought you some wine .
what ? !
i brought you some wine .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t hear you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so naturally soft @-@ spoken .
i brought you some wine .
okay , who needs dogs ?
thank you so much . look--
oh , you warmed my buns .
yes .
i don &apos;t know if i can handle all this meat .
is she kidding me with this ?
just go .
no one was really enjoying themselves ...
except for barry .
hello , sister .
perfect day for a barbecue , isn &apos;t it ?
no , weirdo . it &apos;s pouring outside .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i meant , it &apos;s a perfect day for revenge .
drew kremp is so delicious .
i want to dunk him in a glass of milk and eat him up .
what the hell ?
you recorded my private phone call ?
funny ... how i just happened to pick up
when you were on the phone .
should i play the rest for the guests we &apos;re entertaining ?
okay , you win .
you can use the phone whenever you want , okay ?
just please don &apos;t play it , i &apos;m begging you .
kind of like how i begged you not to tell dad , huh ?
perchance , can you remind me how that turned out ?
will you stop talking like that and just give me the damn tape ?
no .
just give it--
not giving it to you .
stop it !
you &apos;re embarrassing yourself .
give it--
stop !
stop !
i mean , doesn &apos;t &quot; erica kremp &quot; sound perfect ?
when we get married , we &apos;re gonna ski
and speak french all day and have super blonde kids .
oh , dear .
that ... was not the plan .
what was the plan ?
what was the plan ? !
kids , enough !
this is so out of character for them .
let me punch you !
get off me !
kids , i told you not to punch each other in the privates .
no phone for either of you .
stop moving !
eat it !
murray , wake the up !
well , you know , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s getting late .
we should probably head out . okay . bye @-@ bye now . good time .
a week went by , and i hadn &apos;t seen chad .
thankfully , pops was always there when i needed him .
okay , and we &apos;re rolling .
action !
what &apos;s my first line ?
oh , come on , seriously ?
you got fruit punch on your suit ?
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i @-@ i &apos;ve given the character a lot of thought .
this robot loves fruit punch .
he &apos;s a messy robot .
i told you , you &apos;re not a robot .
you &apos;re a program living inside a digital computer world .
or ... instead of him going to a computer world ,
how about he goes to a juice world ?
there &apos;s no such thing as a juice world !
but computer worlds are real ?
just go .
i don &apos;t know why a robot can &apos;t like juice .
where &apos;s chad today ?
uh ... i @-@ i don &apos;t think he &apos;s available .
what do you mean ?
his mom just said
we can &apos;t play together for a while .
what ? !
the nerve of that woman .
i &apos;m marching over there right now
and giving her a piece of my mind .
no ! wait ! your mind is the part that scares her the most .
promise me you won &apos;t go over there .
please . you &apos;ll just make it worse .
all right , love bug .
i won &apos;t go over there , i promise .
my mom was a woman of her word .
she didn &apos;t march over there .
instead , she called .
hello . you &apos;ve reached the kremps .
please leave a message and have a wonderful day .
virginia , it &apos;s beverly goldberg . pick up .
oh , please , i see you lurking behind the curtain
like a weirdo in your own home .
would you pick up the phone already ?
so sorry , i was just in the shower .
cut the crap and tell me why adam can &apos;t play with chad .
i &apos;m sorry . look , i just ...
think that we have different styles--
different ways of speaking
in front of our children ,
and just generally ...
different ways of being in the world .
fine .
if chad can &apos;t play with adam ,
adam can &apos;t play with chad .
and i could give a hoot whether or not you like me
because i have buttloads of friends , okay ?
buttloads .
i ... kept my promise .
i didn &apos;t go over there .
and just like that ,
my mom had hung up on my friendship with chad .
but we weren &apos;t the only ones getting our lines crossed .
my brother and sister &apos;s battle over the phone
had stretched on another day .
but what barry would soon realize was the fight
was about to be taken outside .
i &apos;m serious , lainey .
drew kremp heard everything .
i &apos;m thinking of quitting school and skipping town .
busted ! you are so busted ,
and i &apos;m telling , and barry wins .
mom and dad said we couldn &apos;t use the phone in the house .
technically ... i &apos;m outside the house .
that &apos;s very intelligent .
give it to me ! i gotta make a call !
no way ! it was my idea !
just give it to me !
stop !
lainey , hold on !
give it ... to ... me .
you broke it !
maybe you should call 9 @-@ 7 @-@ 6 @-@ new @-@ phone .
maybe you should call ...
shut up !
are you kidding me ? !
i stand by what i did .
god !
why are we like this ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re a family .
that &apos;s what a family does .
all we ever do is fight , and it &apos;s exhausting .
wait .
you &apos;re not gonna throw mud back in my face ?
what do i do ?
tell me , what do i do ?
for the next week , my mom and virginia kremp
avoided each other . but in a small town ,
you can only avoid someone for so long .
i knew something was wrong
because when i bit into the eclair ,
it tasted like sour cream and pickles .
if they went bad , they went bad on your watch .
i can see why you would think that .
and normally i would never ... ever , ever make a fuss .
but i did purchase these less than 24 hours ago ,
and i still have the receipt .
i &apos;m not takin &apos; these back !
are you kidding me ? !
my mom may have been able to give up on virginia ,
but she couldn &apos;t give up on who she was .
mrs. goldberg ,
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know you two knew each other .
damn right we do . we &apos;re neighbors .
now ... go back and get her some fresh eclairs .
or would you like a repeat ...
of the birthday cake fiasco ?
who writes &quot; sorry for your loss &quot;
on a 10 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s birthday cake ?
it was a mistake , and victor was let go .
yeah .
well , that was a dark day for this store .
but it could get a lot darker .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
sorry , ma &apos;am . i &apos;ll fix you right up .
i know i just made a big , loud scene .
it &apos;s just what i do .
knock , knock . honey ?
are you in there ?
go away . i don &apos;t wanna talk to you .
you &apos;re right . i should give you some space .
at least close the door , and don &apos;t turn on the lights .
darkness is my only friend .
adam , i am so sorry .
you should be sorry ! look at me !
i &apos;m in a glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark unitard !
and chad was the only friend that got me ...
who got this !
and you just had to ruin it ...
just because one person in this world
didn &apos;t like you .
sweetie ...
you &apos;re the one that matters .
i &apos;d rather have nobody like me
than have you be mad at me forever .
not forever , just for about a month and a half .
well ...
let &apos;s see if i can shorten that up just a bit .
yo .
yo .
whatcha doin &apos; ?
nothing .
want to finish our movie ?
yeah . do you ?
hell , yeah .
chad , &quot; h &quot; word .
sorry .
cool .
what the hell &apos;s the &quot; h &quot; word ?
so i was thinking tomorrow we could go for a power walk .
and then you could come over and we could split an eclair .
or i could come over right now ,
and we could each have our own eclair .
mm ... beverly goldberg , you are bad .
i am bad . i am the worst .
let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s do it .
okay .
and just like that , the one person out there
who didn &apos;t like my mom became her best friend .
even my dad ,
who prided himself on having no friends ,
started to come around to the idea .
yo .
yo .
whatcha doin &apos; ?
uh ... nothin &apos; .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re interested , but , um ...
i got eagles season tickets ...
50 yard line .
you around sunday ?
yeah !
watching the kremp kids get along
inspired barry and erica to try something new and crazy--
look out for each other .
hey , chad .
you want to bet i can &apos;t climb the tree in your yard ?
yeah !
we learned a lot from each other .
we taught them it was okay
to raise your voice now and then .
i asked for paper @-@ thin .
you gave me slices ...
thick as my thumb-- not acceptable .
while they learned how to be more like the goldbergs ,
we learned to be a little more like the kremps .
erica , telephone .
what ? push the button , mom .
it &apos;s not hard .
erica ...
how many times do i have to show you how this works ?
how does this stupid thing work ?
erica , telep--
talk into the box !
erica ! telephone !
hello ?
pick up the damn phone !
what &apos;s the matter with you ? mom ?
yep , we were different than the kremps--
not better , not worse--
just ... different .
told you i could do it again .
you &apos;re so stupid for doubting me .
oh , though barry didn &apos;t help our case .
okay , folks . today we &apos;re re @-@ enacting
some &quot; empire strikes back . &quot; are you ready ?
dude , are you sure about this ?
oh , i &apos;m sure . keep it rolling .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
oh , why do you always do this crap ?
i &apos;m your father !
no ... that &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s impossible !
what do you mean &quot; impossible &quot; ?
get the hell outta here !
run !
