vanessa . vanessa , let me in !
mommy ? i &apos;m scared .
kaitlyn , i know you are .
you just have to be real quiet now .
vanessa ! let me in !
911 . what is your emergency ?
hello ? yes , i need you to send someone here right away .
what &apos;s the emergency , ma &apos;am ?
my ex @-@ husband-- he &apos;s trying to break into the house .
vanessa , open the door !
i think he &apos;s been drinking .
please , my children are here .
does he have any weapons ?
he owns several guns .
can you please hurry ?
hpd ! raise your hands and get down here !
sir , come out where we can see you !
hands where i can see them ! do it now !
help me . please .
danny ?
thanks for coming .
how &apos;d you get in ?
i had a key from when i was crashing here .
you know you could look at that stuff all night
and not be any closer to figuring it out .
well , i think i may have figured out where he went .
never seen this .
&quot; shelburne . &quot;
that is definitely not in his handwriting .
no , it &apos;s his father &apos;s .
all right , so what ?
you &apos;re going off to japan , too ?
no , i am not going off to japan , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna stay here and i &apos;m gonna do my job , all right ?
because leaving and not telling anybody where i &apos;m going
is not my style .
yeah , i know .
i mean , this guy-- h @-@ he leaves me a note .
he says he &apos;s going up to shelburne
and disappears for a week , and he doesn &apos;t call .
he doesn &apos;t say , &quot; i am alive . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t say , &quot; everything &apos;s okay . &quot;
well , steve believes shelburne is the answer
to a lot of questions ,
including why his father was murdered .
yeah , but his father &apos;s dead ,
and @-@ and finding shelburne is not gonna change that .
i promise you that .
good evening , governor .
okay .
i &apos;m on my way .
hey , guys .
i thought this was a domestic .
what the hell happened ?
aside from waking up a foot shorter ,
my worst nightmare .
estranged husband tries to break down the door .
drops dead right after hpd arrives
from hemorrhagic smallpox .
apparently , that &apos;s a rare strain that &apos;s almost always fatal .
wait a minute . smallpox . hasn &apos;t that been eradicated ?
see , you can &apos;t believe
everything that you read on the internet .
okay , so how did he get it ?
we don &apos;t know .
cdc &apos;s trying to figure it out .
in the meantime , the governor wants us to run
a parallel investigation quietly .
understood .
right .
wow , max , uh ...
you get that at the mall ? it &apos;s a nice look for you .
thank you . however , it is very itchy .
were you able to examine the victim ?
briefly before the cdc
removed and incinerated him .
how are we supposed to do an investigation without a body ?
not to worry . i was able to obtain blood
and tissue samples ,
plus ... i have pictures .
the victim &apos;s name is bryan palmer , 36 years old .
he was honorably discharged from the army ten months ago
after serving a couple tours in afghanistan ,
and he &apos;s been collecting disability ever since .
if he was military ,
he was probably vaccinated for smallpox recently ,
so how &apos;d he end up like this ?
the vaccination could have worn off .
it &apos;s typically effective for only three to five years .
stop . i have a question .
how does this guy catch an extinct disease to begin with ?
the only known stores of smallpox in the world
are housed in two facilities :
one is the cdc in the united states ,
and the other is in a lab called vector
in koltsovo , russia .
but the cia thinks there are also hidden stores
in russia , france , north korea , and iraq .
why , so a terrorist can get his hands on it
and start an epidemic ?
okay , could he have been exposed in afghanistan ?
no , too much time has passed .
rash onset typically occurs within two weeks of exposure .
mr. palmer has been stateside for nearly a year .
the first thing we need to find out
is when and where he caught this thing .
i don &apos;t think he was exposed in the traditional way .
what do you mean ?
well , smallpox is generally transmitted
through face @-@ to @-@ face contact with a sick person .
transmission through an infected object , such as clothing ,
is also possible , but less effective .
however , in mr. palmer &apos;s case ...
may i ?
go for it .
ah , yes . this appears to be an injection site .
and that is how i believe the victim
contracted the virus .
whoa , are you saying
that smallpox was used as a murder weapon ?
yes .
and depending on how long
he was walking in public while contagious ,
within a few weeks ...
the entire island could be infected .
the doctor doesn &apos;t think we &apos;re infected ,
but he wants to keep us for observation ,
just to be safe .
i can &apos;t believe bryan was so sick .
i should &apos;ve helped him .
no , listen to me .
you 100 % did the right thing . okay ?
i mean , you probably saved your life and your kids &apos; life
by not opening that door .
mrs. palmer , we &apos;re hoping you can help us
build a timeline of where bryan was the past few weeks .
uh ... i really can &apos;t .
bryan moved out a couple months ago .
we were having some problems
after he came back from afghanistan .
okay , where was he living ?
breakers motel .
he was doing really well .
i mean , up until recently ,
i thought there was a chance for us to work it out .
what changed your mind ?
a few weeks ago ,
he just dropped out .
um , he skipped family counseling .
he wouldn &apos;t return phone calls .
i figured he &apos;d gone back to his dark place again .
what , uh , what does that mean ? what &apos;s his dark place ?
he starts drinking ,
holes himself up and doesn &apos;t talk to anybody for days .
it &apos;s pretty awful .
mrs. palmer , i need to draw some blood .
can you put on your mask , ma &apos;am ?
your children , too .
okay . sure .
okay , let &apos;s , uh ...
let &apos;s hope that she &apos;s right about the dark place .
why &apos;s that ?
it means he &apos;s locked up in a hotel room .
he &apos;s not out infecting the entire island .
right .
all right , i &apos;ll call the cdc .
i guess we should check out palmer &apos;s room .
you want to go check out
a smallpox @-@ infested room ?
yeah .
yeah , that sounds , uh ...
like a real hoot .
what are you doing about grace ?
well , luckily , she &apos;s on the mainland with rachel
and stan and the baby , visiting the grandparents .
what about malia ?
i haven &apos;t said anything yet ,
but i &apos;ve already checked outbound flights .
if this thing goes south ,
i &apos;m getting her off the island .
doesn &apos;t exactly look like a dark place of despair .
i don &apos;t see any alcohol .
the 12 steps .
looks like this guy really was getting his act together .
max said the
smallpox could &apos;ve been used as a murder weapon ?
yeah , why ?
well , either this guy killed himself
in a really horrible way ,
or i found a bunch of loaded guns .
so ... it &apos;s not smallpox .
then what the hell is it ?
cdc says the vials you found
in palmer &apos;s motel room contain cyclotriptine .
it &apos;s an experimental antidepressant
undergoing clinical trials pending fda approval .
okay , so the injection mark
on palmer &apos;s arm came from the antidepressant .
that &apos;s the weird thing , &apos; cause max ran a tox screen ,
and there was no cyclotriptine in his system .
he never took it .
meaning max &apos;s smallpox injection theory still stands .
all right , hold on .
this ... this guy palmer , he had the drug , right ?
so he had to be part of the clinical trial .
there &apos;s gotta be , hopefully , a connection between the trial
and how he was exposed to smallpox .
that &apos;s what i was thinking , so i contacted
the pharmaceutical company , bio @-@ statim .
they are conducting trials here on oahu .
unfortunately , the trials are double @-@ blind .
so they don &apos;t know who the participants are .
well , somebody has to have the names .
well , yeah , the local project manager , ken tanner .
he was the one who recruited the participants .
okay , let &apos;s go talk to him .
well , the thing is ...
we have to find him first .
because i contacted the local bio @-@ statim offices .
he never showed up to work today .
all right , uh ... let &apos;s find a home address
on this guy .
okay .
hey . crime lab .
aloha , charlie .
how about some good news ?
i can accommodate that .
i pinged your victim &apos;s cell phone .
and found it . still active .
i can send you the coordinates .
great work . thank you , fong .
all right , you , uh , you track down palmer &apos;s cell .
we &apos;ll go make a house call to this drug company guy .
send me that address , please .
ken tanner ?
ken tanner , open up !
let me ask you a question .
what does that look like to you ?
mosquito bite .
mosquito bite . what do you know ? you &apos;re not a doctor .
no , but you &apos;re a hypochondriac .
oh , what is that ?
i hear an engine running .
he &apos;s in there . get it open . come on .
he &apos;s ice cold .
he &apos;s been dead for a while .
all right .
i guess now we know why he didn &apos;t show up for work .
guilty conscience over palmer &apos;s death .
blood .
maybe this wasn &apos;t a suicide after all .
hey , charlie .
i found the victim &apos;s cell phone .
among some other things .
going to need you to process them right away .
okay , so fong &apos;s going through
the bag of hazardous goodies now .
did you find anything at tanner &apos;s place ?
no . whoever killed him also took his computer
and everything related to the cyclotriptine trials .
who was that ?
uh , nothing .
i ... someone i can just talk to later .
that somebody have a name ?
what ? i can &apos;t have a private life ?
ooh . is it a boy ?
is he cute ?
okay , leave me alone .
i knew something was up .
you got that glow .
okay , i do not glow .
give it up . what &apos;s his name ?
you &apos;ll find out when the time is right .
all right , be like that .
but just remember who &apos;s going to walk you down the aisle .
okay , that &apos;s going to be a very , very long ways away .
not at this rate .
okay , ken tanner did not kill himself .
how do you know ?
max just did the autopsy .
his cause of death was blunt force trauma
to the back of his skull .
crime scene techs pulled a print
off the keys we found in the ignition .
we found the car , and the guy &apos;s in the system .
his name is dracul comescu .
who the hell is that ?
he &apos;s not a vampire .
i thought the very same thing .
he is a romanian
national who &apos;s on the ncis watch list .
very specifically , the office of special projects
in los angeles .
so , what &apos;s he doing here ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m going to find out .
just give me a minute .
yeah .
special agent hanna ?
yeah . who &apos;s this ?
this is detective danny williams
with the governor &apos;s special task force in hawaii .
i believe you know a friend of mine-- a colleague--
steve mcgarrett .
yeah , i know him .
what , is he too busy surfing to call me himself ?
no , he &apos;s ...
sort of on leave right now .
listen , i am calling
about a suspect of ours that we are tracking .
uh , i believe he &apos;s on your watch list .
his name is dracul comescu .
detective williams ,
this is special agent callen .
are you telling me comescu is in hawaii ?
we found his prints at ... at a murder scene .
um , you ... you got history with this guy ?
yeah .
a very personal one .
dracul &apos;s part of a romanian organized crime family ,
and let &apos;s just say we ended
the family business not too long ago .
okay , well , it looks like , uh , he &apos;s got a new hobby .
uh , he may have gotten his hands on the smallpox virus .
that &apos;s why the hawaii national guard
is plussing up their wmd civil support team .
the air force is sending a bird tonight .
so , technically , you guys could hitch a ride ?
how do you feel about pineapples ?
we &apos;re on our way .
charlie , find anything useful ?
not useful so much as intriguing .
look at this .
size medium .
that &apos;s bryan palmer &apos;s size .
i have three of those .
okay .
size double xl .
four of those .
huh . that &apos;s weird .
those must belong to somebody else .
plus ...
i have pants that are varying in size .
28 waist on a few , 40 waist on some others .
altogether , i &apos;d say we have
at least four distinct sets of clothing .
we may have other victims out there .
is there any identification ?
not as such .
however ...
i &apos;ve got a few dozen hair samples to run
against the dna database .
i &apos;ll let you know if i get a hit .
perfect . thanks .
danny williams . welcome to hawaii .
callen .
hanna .
what &apos;s up , buddy ? mcgarrett trying to skip out
on the steak dinner he owes me ?
that would explain a lot . come on .
so , how bad is it ?
the good news is ,
no other cases of smallpox have come up .
bad news is cdc has not had any luck
with their contact trace on our victim .
the guy went missing about a week ago .
we have no idea where he was .
which means we don &apos;t know who else he infected .
that &apos;s exactly what it means , yeah .
now , we picked up the latest chatter
on dracul comescu .
he &apos;s spent the past three months in siberia .
let me guess : he &apos;s buying smallpox .
well , based on what you &apos;ve been dealing with here ,
that would be the theory , but dracul is not an ideologue .
his main agenda is making money , not terrorism .
our guess is that he found a buyer
looking for a biological weapon .
hold on . you &apos;re telling me that this guy
is ready to risk a worldwide epidemic
just to make some cash ?
without even blinking . what about you ?
i hear you got a personal beef with him .
comescus tried to kill my entire family .
say again .
blood feud .
well , that , uh ... that happens .
that &apos;s a nice ride .
thank you .
what &apos;s her name ?
her name is , uh ... is car .
car ?
yeah .
i &apos;m going to find you a name .
shotgun .
agent callen , hanna ,
ncis . chin ho kelly ,
kono kalakaua .
welcome .
hawaii five @-@ o.
steve speaks very highly of you .
well , i &apos;m sorry he missed the party .
yeah , all right , enough with the pleasantries .
uh , kono , what &apos;s good ?
so , one of our techs
was able to identify four distinct dna samples
from the bag we found .
the victim , bryan palmer , being one of them .
the rest we were able to pull from the database .
so , we have paul scully ,
terence hill , luis salazar .
and we can &apos;t find any of them .
i got to take this . sorry .
hpd search their homes ,
and what do they find in every medicine cabinet ?
experimental antidepressants .
that &apos;s right-- they were all on
the cyclotriptine clinical trial .
but that &apos;s not the only thing they had in common .
they were all either single or divorced ,
no family on the island ,
and they were all on disability ,
so no jobs to go to .
which makes them ideal victims .
they go missing , no one &apos;s looking for them .
so you &apos;re saying this whole drug trial thing was a sham or ... ?
well , i contacted the pharmaceutical company .
the trial &apos;s legit .
okay .
maybe the trial
is how he got to these guys .
what do you mean ?
ken tanner .
he &apos;s got a list of people
willing to undergo a drug experiment .
uh , plus he got all their vital information .
so comescu bribed him to get the names
of people that wouldn &apos;t be missed .
and he uses them as guinea pigs .
they think they &apos;re getting antidepressants ,
but he &apos;s really shooting them up with smallpox .
and i guarantee you that comescu
did not plan on having bryan palmer escape .
right , he escapes , he exposes the entire experiment .
he &apos;s got to clear his tracks ,
so he kills tanner , first things first .
right , well , scully , hill , and salazar could still be alive .
yes , and the only way
we &apos;re going to help them is if we find out
where this experiment is going down , so ...
i can help with that .
i had ken tanner &apos;s financials run .
this guy was in real trouble .
he was underwater on his mortgage ; he was maxed out
on all of his credit cards ; then two months ago ,
he gets a wire transfer in the amount of $ 500,000
from a company called cf &amp; q limited .
that &apos;s a comescu holdings corporation .
all right , so tanner keeps half
of the money , and then , with the other half ,
he ends up buying medical supplies .
he gets , uh , hospital beds ,
laboratory equipment
and a sophisticated air filtration system .
and all of it was delivered to a warehouse ...
... on sand island .
you know what they used to call sand island ?
what &apos;s that ?
quarantine island .
sounds like a great place to start an epidemic .
there &apos;s cameras all over the place .
they probably already know we &apos;re here .
let &apos;s not make them wait , huh ?
cover ! cover !
that &apos;s dracul ! he &apos;s in the car .
let &apos;s go ! move ! move !
go , go , go , go !
look , go around and cut him off .
get in front of him .
trying to .
hold it steady .
hold it steady . you shoot like ray charles . come on .
watch out for the dumpster .
i see the dumpster . thank you .
might want to work on your driving position .
your wrist &apos;s in the wrong place .
my wrists are wrong ... ?
what is it with navy seals and backseat driving ?
watch out for the car .
i see the car .
might want to turn around .
you think so , doctor ?
i do think so .
i ask him to turn around , he goes in reverse .
chin , i got jammed up . do you see him ?
no , we don &apos;t .
there he is , headed for that bridge .
we can &apos;t let him get on the mainland .
danny , cut him off . cut him off .
chin , we got him . we &apos;re good .
comescu in there ?
no , it &apos;s just the driver .
must have jumped out at the warehouse .
what the hell is this ?
looks like a quarantine station .
really ?
should we call somebody or ... ?
salazar , hill ,
and scully .
he gave them smallpox , too .
wasn &apos;t smallpox kill them ,
comescu executed them .
so ?
well , we did find
smallpox virus samples , but not all of them .
apparently several vials are missing .
well , there was nothing in comescu &apos;s vehicle .
he must have taken the virus with him .
this is quite a sophisticated setup .
negative pressurization system , top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line equipment .
all right , there &apos;s no way a romanian thug
did this by himself .
i concur .
someone with very specialized scientific knowledge is involved .
what about the videocameras ?
maybe we got a picture of him .
cdc found footage .
evidently our suspect used it
to document the progression of the disease .
okay , uh , we &apos;ll have kono
go over to cdc . maybe , uh ,
frankenstein got caught on tape .
should i be wearing a mask ?
technically , yes .
i &apos;m leaving , okay ?
okay , uh , callen and hanna
are looking for potential smallpox buyers .
they &apos;re at tsa , checking incoming flights .
meantime , we &apos;re gonna go to this hospital ,
see if comescu &apos;s driver is feeling chatty .
he &apos;s not gonna tell us anything .
no , he &apos;s not ,
but we are gonna use a page
out of mcgarrett &apos;s playbook .
and what do you mean by that ?
take the playbook , and you set it on fire .
all right .
patient beta developed flu @-@ like symptoms 20 hours ago .
temperature at 38.5 degrees celsius .
eight hours later ,
a rash emerged on the tongue and in the mouth .
i expect the pustular rash period to begin
within the next ten to 12 hours .
it &apos;s astonishing .
if i &apos;m understanding this correctly ,
they have significantly reduced the incubation
and prodrome periods .
meaning what ?
well , with hemorrhagic smallpox ,
the time between exposure and death is typically
14 to 28 days .
this version of the virus reduced that to three days .
so , what kind of impact would that have on an outbreak ?
monumental .
the disease would spread faster and more efficiently
than we could mobilize the vaccine .
you know the man talking--
does he ever appear on camera ?
nah , we &apos;ve gone through everything .
he only narrates , never shows up on screen .
still , there &apos;s something about him .
what &apos;s that ?
well , i feel like i know that voice .
he sounds familiar to me , but i can &apos;t place him .
maybe it &apos;s not the first video he &apos;s made .
hey , buddy ,
why don &apos;t you , uh , grab a cup of coffee , huh ?
all right , thanks .
this is marku , comescu &apos;s driver .
you don &apos;t look so bad after all that , huh ?
doc says you got a couple of fractures ,
minor concussion ,
but you &apos;re gonna be out of here in no time .
you know what we call that here in hawaii ?
pomaika &apos;i .
good luck .
yeah , but you know what they say about luck .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
well , you shouldn &apos;t be afraid of me .
&apos;cause i am a very nice guy .
but this ...
this you should be afraid of .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t have any idea what it is .
we found it in that lab of yours .
we want to test it out now .
see , i like that .
very scientific .
you &apos;re american police officers .
you can &apos;t do anything to me .
well , i &apos;m certainly not gonna tell anybody .
are you gonna tell anyone ?
not me .
all right , that &apos;s settled .
where &apos;s comescu ?
screw you .
okay .
marku , so hostile .
hey , what ... ?
wait , wait , wait .
take it out .
take it out !
i got it stopped .
i &apos;m gonna take it out .
just tell us where comescu is .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know where he is .
i swear .
all right , we &apos;re back in the building .
how much of the virus did he take with him ?
stop !
nine vials , okay ? take it out .
okay , okay , who &apos;s he selling it to ?
a @-@ all i know is the buy is going down today .
2 o &apos;clock . international market place .
but , uh , s @-@ s @-@ something is wrong .
what ?
when dracul got there to pick up the product ,
everyone was dead .
all the patients , shot in the head .
and you expect us to believe
that you didn &apos;t kill those men ?
it wasn &apos;t us . i swear to you !
i swear .
wait !
the doctor ... the doctor was gone .
what doctor ?
give us a name .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know . i swear !
please , take it out !
it &apos;s coming ; i can &apos;t .
wait !
relax , relax , buddy .
it is vitamin b @-@ 12 .
it is supposed to aid in healing .
you &apos;ll be fine .
aloha .
the buyers are chechen rebels from the ingushetia regiment .
our office is sending pictures .
they blew up a bus stop in moscow last year .
good .
you know what would make this perfect ?
if there was more people here ; i mean , if we &apos;re gonna have
a biological disaster , why don &apos;t we go big , you know ?
why do you dress like that ?
you &apos;re in hawaii .
it &apos;s my style .
it &apos;s not a style . it &apos;s a bad habit .
how &apos;s it looking , g ?
no sign of dracul yet .
i should have been the one questioning that driver .
hey , even your partner
thought that was a bad idea , agent callen .
we just got photos of the chechens .
we got deni islamov , sergei aminev .
kono , what &apos;s the bird &apos;s @-@ eye view ?
not yet .
hold on .
here we go .
the chechens are near aina alley ,
northwest corner of the market .
danny , you and sam are closest .
they &apos;re coming toward you
right about now .
all right , there they are .
let &apos;s go .
hold on . there &apos;s comescu .
he &apos;s over by the jewelry vendors .
i got him .
he &apos;s not carrying anything .
where are the smallpox vials ?
the buy already happened .
if it did , the smallpox is in that bag ,
well , then we got to take them now , let &apos;s go .
hey , how you doing , man ?
come on , frankie .
take a walk .
oh , frankie , baby ,
you got to lay off the mai @-@ tais .
don &apos;t move .
all right ,
chechens are in custody .
the cash is still with them .
the buy hasn &apos;t happened yet . i repeat :
the buy is still in play .
there .
that &apos;s dracul &apos;s bodyguard .
vials must be in the case .
they &apos;re getting spooked .
we got to move on this .
all right , we &apos;re moving in .
dracul comescu , hold it right there .
get down ! down ! down !
chin ?
chin , what &apos;s going on ?
chin ?
comescu &apos;s running .
kono , you got eyes on them ?
stand by .
yes . bodyguard .
he &apos;s near the food vendors .
i don &apos;t see comescu , i think they split up .
there &apos;s dracul . go .
chin , behind you !

let her go .
drop your weapon now
or she dies .
let her go !
all right .
i &apos;m dropping my weapon , all right ?
i &apos;m dropping my weapon .
nice shot , cuz !
no sign of the briefcase .
comescu must have it .
move !
freeze !
it &apos;s over .
you set down the case .
well , well , agent callen .
you come all this way to see me ?
i &apos;m honored .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
i came for the weather .
you want to get off this island alive ,
set down the case and you step away .
you ... you destroyed my life !
right back at you .
hands where i can see them !
sa mori tu !
you all right ?
we just recovered every missing vial of smallpox .
so , yeah , i &apos;m good .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the smallpox .
i know .
can i have that hot sauce ?
here comes the seafood course .
and after that , the second seafood course .
and save some room for dessert .
please ,
you got to stop .
honestly , i &apos;m going to burst .
positive thinking , brah . you can do it .
thank you for the shrimp truck swag , kamekona .
think you &apos;re gonna have to give yours to hetty .
that &apos;s looking a little small .
brah , how much you lift ?
much as you need me to .
i &apos;d still kick your ass though .
of that i have no doubt , kamekona .
all right .
well , i can see the attraction of living here .
yeah , it kind of grows on you .
that &apos;s the nicest thing danny ever said about this place .
i didn &apos;t mean it .
i got it .
winifred .
what &apos;s winifred ?
that &apos;s your car &apos;s name .
you want to name my car winifred ?
it &apos;s a good name .
it &apos;s a terrible name .
i like it .
it &apos;s classy .
sounds like somebody &apos;s grandmother .
i want to do something nice .
something simple like , um ... misty .
how about misty ?
that &apos;s a stripper name .
i &apos;m okay with that .
it &apos;s winifred .
winnie for short .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , kono , what &apos;s up ? you on your way here ?
i just got off the phone with dr. dusek from cdc .
the vials you recovered from comescu
did not contain smallpox .
hold on .
what are you talking about ?
they were saline .
the virus is still out there .
comescu thought that it was smallpox , okay ?
he was ready to break the thing open
in public just to expose callen .
somebody had to switch the vials .
i think i know who .
the doctor who was running the experiment .
don &apos;t move , okay ?
come on . we got to go .
his name is dr . jarrod prodeman .
he &apos;s a formerly highly respected epidemiologist .
i was able to match his voice from the experiment video
with some old lectures posted online .
why formerly respected ?
well , evidently he was disgraced
after he faked some data to obtain a research grant ,
and he hasn &apos;t been able to work since .
great . so he decides to start making biological weapons . perfect .
so comescu gets the smallpox in russia ,
gives it to prodeman to modify ,
but prodeman double @-@ crosses him and keeps it for himself .
but why double @-@ cross the guys he &apos;s working for ?
maybe he found another buyer .
hold on .
hey , guys , don &apos;t come to hq .
tsa has prodeman booked on a flight
departing for los angeles in 15 minutes .
send a picture of prodeman to tsa ,
tell them to ground that plane ,
but do not to move on him
until we get there , okay ?
we &apos;ve grounded the flight for maintenance .
uh , the passengers are waiting here at the gate .
your guy checked in several hours ago ,
but we haven &apos;t been able to locate him .
i don &apos;t see him .
we &apos;ll make him come to us .
excuse me ...
marcy .
uh , i need you to page one of your passengers
and offer him a first @-@ class seat .
could you do that , please ?
uh , sure .
okay . his name is jarrod prodeman .
attention in the gate area ,
will passenger jarrod prodeman
please come to the desk regarding a seat upgrade ?
that &apos;s not dr. prodeman .
hi .
i &apos;m jarrod prodeman .
hey . i got your upgrade over this way , buddy .
come on .
you &apos;re not prodeman .
who are you ?
what , you got to think of your answer ?
no , i ...
benjamin gallagher .
i @-@ i knew this was a bad idea .
no , no , no , benji ,
traveling under a false identity is a fantastic idea .
where &apos;s prodeman ?
i don &apos;t know .
you got his ticket ! is he a buddy of yours ?
look , i never met the guy before .
he came up to me at the gate
and asked me to switch flights with him .
right , and i &apos;m sure you did it just out of
the kindness of your heart .
well , that and he @-@ he gave me $ 500 .
he had some sob story about
his girlfriend being on an earlier flight .
she was scared to fly without him .
he was traveling with a woman ?
yeah .
uh , the game was on at the bar ,
and i figured , you know , do the guy a solid ,
make a little money .
is that so bad ?
what flight was he on ?
792 .
