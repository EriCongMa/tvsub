abed , what are you doing ?
freelancing .
you &apos;re not a spy for the city , are you ?
they &apos;ve been sending footage of my classroom
and pronounced me no worse than the teachers that work hard .
i can &apos;t tell you who i &apos;m working for .
it &apos;s a surprise .
well , don &apos;t get in the way .
you know the rules , jeff .
the sooner you ignore me , the sooner i stop being a factor .
all right , people .
yesterday
i wrote the word law on the board .
this time , don &apos;t erase it ,
and maybe tomorrow we &apos;ll get even further .
now , i &apos;m told garrett has
prepared a presentation for extra credit .
by the way , everyone in class
gets the credit because i &apos;m not sure how
much i should encourage this .
go ahead , garrett .
thank you .
my presentation is about marriage law .
this is me , garrett .
i &apos;m in your class .
this is stacy .
she is in our class as well .
this is what i want .
oh , garrett .
stacy , will you marry me ?
yes , yes , garrett , yes , i will !
oh , garrett !
garrett and i have been seeing each other for
16 months , two weeks , and four days .
we met at the school store , pencils and such .
he said he was there for the such .
i remember i was sweating a lot , and breathing heavy , and
my heart felt like it was going to burst in my chest .
but the day i met stacy ,
most of those symptoms actually declined .
are you quite done ?
yeah .
garrett wanted the proposal recorded .
he thought his family might wanna see proof .
so now what are you shooting ?
you had a strange look on your face .
oh , you &apos;re noticing faces now ?
aren &apos;t you still smelling hair
to tell frankie from annie ?
yeah .
well , it &apos;s official .
i &apos;m getting laid .
第六季 第十二集
what are you doing ?
stop .
hey , stop .
if you don &apos;t put that silly thing away ,
i swear , i &apos;m gonna stop loving you .
oh , that &apos;s it .
happy birthday .
what are you two doing ?
we &apos;re doing annie &apos;s missing lover footage .
you , you know in movies where
the hero &apos;s wife or girlfriend is dead or missing ,
and so he sits in the dark
and he watches her in a home movie , or-
or a hologram .
or a hologram over and over ,
and she &apos;s always beautiful and full of love ,
almost to the point of being stupid .
we &apos;re making footage like
that for me in case i get kidnapped or murdered .
oh , super healthy , guys .
the health department called .
they don &apos;t want anything back .
britta , don &apos;t look at the camera .
okay , look at the camera .
today &apos;s garrett &apos;s wedding .
for those who don &apos;t know , garrett ,
he &apos;s a guy we don &apos;t really know ,
that we &apos;ve known for like six years at school ,
the funny @-@ looking guy .
britta , mean !
sorry !
the eccentric @-@ looking guy .
what &apos;s happening ?
everything &apos;s going wrong .
that guy .
remember when we said we were cleaning ?
yeah . but remember about abed &apos;s documentary ?
the documentary is about what we &apos;re doing .
and we &apos;re cleaning .
yeah , but if we &apos;re both cleaning
then there &apos;s nobody to explain why .
she doesn &apos;t understand filmmaking .
i lived in new york .
what else should we talk about ?
we volunteered our apartment
as a staging area where our friends
can get ready and keep each other on time .
the thing to understand about our friends
is that friends isn &apos;t an adequate label .
we &apos;re an intensely , intimately bonded crew .
god . oh , i can &apos;t , no !
no !
do you want flashy forward , or cherry and classic ?
do you have black ?
that &apos;s a no .
that beleaguered sigh means ,
no , i can &apos;t have black nails .
don &apos;t look at the camera .
you absolutely can ,
and we all will when our bodies decompose .
please don &apos;t jim the camera like that .
jim the camera ?
the color black hasn &apos;t had
it &apos;s not a color .
anything to do with death or edginess since &apos; 89 !
i mean , absence of color .
my accountant has black nails !
your what ? !
don &apos;t jump on that ,
my accountant , it &apos;s a figure of speech .
it &apos;s a form of speech called making things up .
abed , can you get that ?
i can film you getting it .
it &apos;s open !
is it ?
i don &apos;t know , let &apos;s see .
frankie .
hi girl .
so , i didn &apos;t , put on my wedding clothes , like you said .
so we can get dressed together and be girls together .
this is gonna be fun .
annie and britta told me to come over and
get ready with them for garrett &apos;s wedding .
i didn &apos;t say no .
who says no to something like that ?
a cold , off @-@ putting incompatible person .
the kind of person that turns a sleepover into a stoning .
i had rocks , thrown at me .
biblical , igneous , jagged ,
hateful , pointy , ninja rocks ,
and that &apos;s not gonna happen again .
what have you been up to ?
i think you already asked that .
did you answer ?
didn &apos;t i ?
i think i did .
i don &apos;t think you did .
well , that &apos;s not like me .
well , maybe you &apos;re nervous .
no , no .
well , why don &apos;t we just say that if you did answer , we forgot
so we &apos;re asking again .
oh , i have been working .
and i &apos;ve been tending to my personal affairs .
mia , i don &apos;t know if i mentioned .
one of my sisters as well , you know ,
one of them is deceased ,
and the other is
mentally retarded .
panty raid .
when i say drink , you say now .
drink .
now .
drink .
now .
when i say drink , you say now .
drink .
now .
drink .
now .
hey what are you guys doing ?
we gotta go . the wedding starts in like 40 minutes .
we batted the time .
we lied to you cause we knew you &apos;d be late .
so we lied to you about the time .
yeah !
you don &apos;t need perfect people to make a perfect team .
you need people whose flaws feed into each other .
it &apos;s what do you call it ?
co @-@ dependence .
synergy .
for instance , there might be something britta hates doing ,
but annie loves doing .
or there might be something that annie hates doing ,
but she does it anyways ,
because what she really loves is to feel useful .
you literally just defined co @-@ dependence .
here &apos;s to synergy .
oh , look at you .
you little helper .
okay ,
do you garrett take
jack nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife ?
i do .
i do , johnny .
we invented a new game .
celebrity garrett marriage .
christian slater to be your lawfully wedded wife .
i do .
i do .
boo .
there &apos;s only nicholson .
yeah , well , listen to him .
we were genius to pad the time margin .
because now we have , like , three more hours to play the game .
okay . do you , garrett ,
take aubrey plaza to be your wife ?
i do .
i do .
wait .
what do you mean , three more hours ?
how is that even possible ?
what , what time is the wedding ?
wait , what time is it now ?
we &apos;re late .
we &apos;re late .
gather everyone to the car .
what ?
yeah .
we &apos;ll drive together .
we are not driving together .
it &apos;s already been settled .
nothing was settled .
what ?
they left me home alone .
i &apos;m home alone .
well , not really .
what the hell you doing ?
c &apos;mon , let &apos;s go , go , go , go , go , go , go .
okay .
geez .
abed , you too .
come on .
oh , yeah .
we are here to witness the union of garrett and stacy
in the eyes of ,
well in the eyes of whatever power you choose .
personally , i find the notion of choosing
to be needlessly limited .
what if i &apos;m capable of total contradiction ?
what if science and religion were mine
to wield as i choose ?
what if i &apos;m god ?
what if i &apos;m god ?
it is likely that i am not , but
i think it &apos;s totally out of line
to take that possibility off of the table .
now , i understand that vows have been written .
stacy , when i first saw you ,
looking at you made me feel good .
touching you , felt better
and knowing you made me realize that without you ,
i , i am incomplete .
i know i look pretty complete .
somebody over there laughed at that the wrong way .
you are my body and my soul .
you are my favorite video game .
yes . come on .
guys , guys guys .
everybody &apos;s looking at us .
your shh was louder than what i said .
welcome !
everyone back there , you &apos;re welcome .
please join us .
any of those people could be god .
okay . over there .
yes .
garrett , since we met
you have felt so familiar .
i love making sandwiches with you .
i love folding towels with you .
i love giving you your pain killers , at the end of the day .
well that , those aren &apos;t really vows .
that &apos;s a list of things you love about me , yeah .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
garrett , do you take stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife .
i do .
stacy , do you take garrett
to be your lawfully wedded husband ,
to have and to hold and to honor .
yes i do .
ladies and gentlemen , mr. and mrs. garrett lambert ,
garrett you may kiss mrs. garrett .
where the party at ?
okay , let &apos;s endure this .
are we nailing today , or what ?
who would have thought barrett &apos;s wedding
would be the best day of our lives .
definitely not garrett , since his name &apos;s not barrett .
whoopsie . we say a wrong a name .
racist .
oh , no . you a racist .
that guy &apos;s a racist .
from here to there is racist .
having a good time ?
oh , yes .
are you garrett &apos;s mom ?
i sure am .
i think you guys could maybe take a step back ,
gain a little perspective ,
so you don &apos;t wreck the whole night
for some really wonderful people .
you came to a wedding in the middle of the vows through a bush .
i &apos;m not dr. phil , but ,
i don &apos;t want my son to kill himself ,
so , do what you gotta do !
yeah .
holy crap .
what have we done ?
okay , we just got checked .
and it was pretty deserved .
but , we &apos;re not just gonna stand here and lick our wounds either .
jeff is right .
and that chipper passive aggressive lady , she &apos;s right , too .
so , let &apos;s spread out and ...
be the best wedding guests , anyone has ever seen !
yes .
yeah .
i &apos;m not gonna over think it , i &apos;m just gonna try it .
okay .
yes . yes .
mazeltov .
so , a stranger walked over to our very proud group
and smashed our pride into pieces with a hammer ,
which definitely felt like a disaster .
then , i started to pick up the pieces of our pride ,
and weirdly enough ,
the first piece i picked up was my own pride , all of it .
it &apos;s almost like groups and people in groups ,
can never be complete at the same time .
does that make any sense ?
no ?
well , that &apos;s your problem .
i love you , abed .
do i know how to be a good wedding guest ?
yes , i do .
a little too well , that &apos;s the problem .
my name is elroy patashnik ,
and from 2006 to 2009,
i was addicted to encouraging white people .
all right !
now there &apos;s a man who knows his meatballs .
thank you .
it started as simple survival .
the tech industry in the 90s , this face , this voice ,
they &apos;re either gonna help you or hold you back .
so , you tap the gas , because well , why tap the brake ?
oh , you know , you know what you &apos;re doing .
this man knows exactly what he &apos;s doing .
i learned the cheat code .
white people like encouragement .
it really doesn &apos;t matter what for .
now , that &apos;s a container for liquid .
i never felt like a sellout .
i never laugh at anything unfunny , never said anything untrue .
the thing is , and this will sound racist ,
white people are very discouraged ,
and very discouraging to each other .
sweetie , you , you &apos;re getting meatball juice
everywhere but your plate .
i think i &apos;m going better than you are , with your asparagus .
oh , now that &apos;s the way to handle meatballs .
and look at you .
working that asparagus .
so , the day you start telling them ,
hey , just do what you &apos;re doing !
i love you .
i love you .
you feel like a superhero .
but , what &apos;s the danger ?
why &apos;d i stop ?
you know , same as anything else that makes you feel good .
if you don &apos;t put a lid on it .
* oh , look at these pants . *
* he should keep on wearing *
* keep on wearing his pants *
there &apos;s no lid .
stacy has a 90 year old meemaw here .
i pushed her around the dance floor .
i think she liked it .
no , that &apos;s polly .
no , great aunt polly is garrett &apos;s side .
i haven &apos;t met her .
oh my god , do you think she saw me pushing meemaw ,
and now she &apos;s wondering what &apos;s wrong with her ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
annie , the world will still need you
after you finish your cake .
am i that bad ?
we have the same dragon .
eventually you will slay it ,
or train it , or dissolve in its stomach .
its name is helping others .
if i train it , can i give it a cooler name ?
if you train it , you can do anything you want .
if you slay it , i don &apos;t know .
i guess you get a new dragon named yourself .
and then you &apos;d be jeff winger .
yeah , that guy needs help !
what would you name your dragon ?
i think we need a list of dragon names .
yeah !
and then we need to get you away from jeff .
is what i wanted to say , but how is that my business ?
you don &apos;t show these to people when you finish them ?
no .
okay , good .
so then why do you make them , again ?
it relaxes me .
it &apos;s like knitting with less discipline .
princess firebreath .
sir pent .
doctor rachel spinetail .
holly hotbreath .
jimmy talon .
christian scale .
i got into a bit of a celebrity pun barrel here .
carson scaley .
jude claw .
ariana puffington .
are these your biggest ice cubes ?
no , you &apos;re boisterous !
where &apos;s my brother ! ?
i &apos;ve gotta thing to say about my friend garrett !
there has been a plot twist
in the story of our comeback as wedding guests .
garrett &apos;s older brother bones
has relapsed during his weekend pass
and will be unable to do the best man toast .
you got him ?
so , i took garrett &apos;s mom &apos;s side
and told her after our behavior today ,
it was the least i could do for them .
and i &apos;m not gonna winger speech it ,
this is a thing of substance .
we pooled all the inside info based on all the mingling ,
and this toast is rocket fueled selflessness .
and this wedding is gonna regret the day
it thought we &apos;d make it about us .
because we &apos;re about to be the first guests
in history to out @-@ toast the entire wedding party .
god , i love my job !
wait , this isn &apos;t my job .
god , i love myself !
that was stacy &apos;s
first time !
but it &apos;s not gonna be her last time , right garrett ?
so many classic toast errors .
a fire hydrant could follow this .
i love you so much , and please , keep painting .
don &apos;t let garrett , don &apos;t paint .
don &apos;t let garrett keep you from painting .
okay , i &apos;m done .
okay , stacy &apos;s friend andi , everybody .
next up we have a replacement best man ,
garrett &apos;s friend from greendale college , jeffrey winger .
there &apos;s a lot of things i can say about this couple .
they &apos;re both in my class at greendale ,
and like all my students , i give them till about june .
no , you guys &apos;ll be fine forever ,
as long as stacy never lets andi babysit .
or go near a child .
or be in the same town as a pair of scissors .
this girl &apos;s a wreck .
he &apos;s being too mean .
no , he &apos;s reading the room .
andi was a bummer , they needed this .
life &apos;s about two people merging their lives ,
but that means
two families are leaving here tonight as one .
that &apos;s a big deal .
now my friends and i came here tonight as outsiders ,
but thanks to some good advice ,
we spent the night learning about these two clans of outsiders .
we learned that garrett &apos;s uncle tony is a photographer .
but uncle tony ,
did you know that stacy &apos;s friend lawrence makes and sells frames ?
yeah , look each other up , get some business going .
oh , and garrett &apos;s neighbor dawn loves vintage cars .
stacy &apos;s chiropractor susan brought her dad ,
and guess what ?
her dad worked in an automobile factory in the 60s .
yeah , i know , these are the kind of things you learn
being the biggest jerks at a wedding .
here &apos;s another golden nugget in the gravel .
some of you have worked the dance floor
with garrett &apos;s divine great aunt polly ,
90 years young .
and some of you chatted with stacy &apos;s meemaw ,
also 90 years young .
now , i don &apos;t know if they &apos;ve even met before tonight ,
but we did learn
that both of them were born in the same town .
sheridan , wyoming .
now garrett and stacy ,
would you mind getting them both out here ?
all right . yeah !
i know aunt polly &apos;s here .
isn &apos;t she beautiful ?
okay . who has got eyes on meemaw ?
this is meemaw .
oh , this is meemaw !
okay , i feel like an idiot .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
garrett , where &apos;s aunt polly ?
okay .
i , now i don &apos;t feel as stupid
because either someone here is lying ,
or this family &apos;s a lot closer than we thought .
and now , this is a man
that knows how to marry his cousin .
none of this would have happened
if i wasn &apos;t always trying to help .
actually , none of this would have happened
if i hadn &apos;t tried helping you with your helpfulness .
oh , don &apos;t torture yourself with that logic .
none of us would have met if hitler hadn &apos;t been born .
also none of britta &apos;s arguments would have a default analogy .
excuse me ?
he &apos;s saying you go to the hitler well a lot .
what are you , hitler , hitler ?
okay , britta , we &apos;re all the worst right now ,
take a day off .
i did .
between us ruining the ceremony
and ruining the reception when we were all just individual people ,
i wasn &apos;t the worst .
i &apos;m only the worst with you guys .
well , me too .
me too .
i was a good dean before you guys .
you can &apos;t disprove it .
i relapsed because of you guys .
what ?
oh it &apos;s not a big deal .
white people problems .
i like this group .
i &apos;m at my best when i &apos;m with you guys .
well , that clinches it .
separate cabs .
separate cabs .
separate cabs .
for those still with us , we won &apos;t be cutting the cake or dancing .
and i believe there was a guy in a homer simpson costume
that was gonna surprise me .
that won &apos;t be necessary !
drive safe , and thank you for coming .
what are you going to do ?
chang !
we &apos;re going home .
are you gonna stay married ?
chang !
we consulted with a lawyer , and
it is legal in this state to marry your cousin .
but after talking to our family ,
we feel an annulment is warranted .
what no , screw that .
chang . no .
chang , get back here .
hey , screw you guys .
no , this family is so screwed up ,
you thought you were two different families .
now that you know you &apos;re not ,
you can &apos;t wait to leave , and you want this guy to do what ?
forget he &apos;s in love ?
for you ?
you want him to take one for this crappy team ?
let him finish .
they were letting me finish , sir .
i know , i was being sarcastic .
okay , you know ?
garrett , who loves you here more than stacy ?
nobody .
stacy , is it your fault garrett &apos;s your cousin ?
no .
is anyone here going to make less fun of these two
or be better friends to them no matter what they do ?
no .
no .
it &apos;s you against the world , and you will not win .
but , you get to make your moves .
not them .
stacy ,
will you be my legally incestuous wife ?
yes .
everyone stay and eat cake , or go to hell .
this is about me .
i didn &apos;t think i could do it , but i did .
smile . smile .
garrett , look up .
so much jimming .
wow , what an episode of community .
hi , i &apos;m briggs hatton credited author of this weeks episode .
you might have noticed an emphasis on the topic of incest ,
well that &apos;s no accident .
for the past two years ,
when not serving as writer &apos;s assistant on community ,
i &apos;ve been researching incest on the internet .
what i found , surprised me .
did you know that first cousins can have children
without great risk of birth defect or genetic disease ?
that &apos;s a quote directly
from the new york times , april 4 , 2002 .
but despite this scientific fact ,
state laws on incest remain inconsistent and woefully outdated .
i mean i , i can make love to my cousin in nebraska ,
but if i take her on a date in south dakota ,
i &apos;m looking at 15 years prison time .
i told the community writers ,
attention must be paid .
they said they &apos;d allow me to address it on one condition .
at the end of the episode ,
i must appear and identify myself as a writer .
look , i &apos;m not trying to tell you how to feel about incest ,
i &apos;m just letting you know ,
there &apos;s more to it than you &apos;ve been told .
i &apos;m briggs hatton ,
and i wrote the community season six , incest episode .
good night .
did you get any of that ?
