第七季 第三集
so ... couldn &apos;t help but notice
none of you rsvp &apos;d to my murder mystery dinner party .
oh , yeah .
we were meaning to do that .
no , you weren &apos;t , because it was a week ago
and nobody came !
so , if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed
koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference ,
it was all of you .
i don &apos;t think that qualifies as a mystery .
we all knew what we were doing .
we &apos;re sorry , rajesh .
maybe we can do it next week .
whoa , whoa , we &apos;re not that sorry .
don &apos;t worry , i can take a hint .
no more murder mystery parties .
thank you .
hallelujah .
because i &apos;ve got something even better planned .
aw ! why ?
come on .
just hear me out .
i &apos;m going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt like they have at m.i.t.
i loved those .
i did them every year there .
we did them at princeton , too .
oh , that &apos;s cute . like it &apos;s a real college .
that &apos;s amusing-- i was going to say that about m.i.t. ,
but it works for princeton , too .
scavenger hunts at harvard were really tough .
i always got stuck on the first challenge--
trying to find someone to be on a team with me .
i guess that story &apos;s more sad than funny .
i love scavenger hunts .
my friends and i had them all the time .
oh , these are a little different .
there &apos;s a tradition at elite universities .
and princeton .
a tradition of hunts full of puzzles
that rely on logic and obscure knowledge , science .
oh , in ours we would just run around town
looking for a store that would sell us beer .
so , uh , who &apos;s in ?
i think it sounds fun .
yeah , me , too .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s do it .
i &apos;m sorry . are we really doing this
or are we tricking koothrappali again
like with the dinner party ?
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , everything i could possibly need
to win the scavenger hunt .
you really think he &apos;s gonna send us to a bowling alley ?
well , if he does ,
do you know how filthy those rental balls are ?
they might as well stand on the corner
and give away free rectal exams .
okay , everybody .
who &apos;s ready for a ...
scavenger hunt ... ?
somewhere ...
in the city of pasadena ,
i &apos;ve hidden a golden coin .
you will be faced with a total
of ten puzzles !
each p ...
each ...
each puzzle will lead you
to the location of the next .
the last of which
will lead you to the coin .
the first team that finds it ...
wins !
he is a born showman .
any questions ?
yes , to be fair ,
do people who went to princeton get a head start ?
that &apos;s not funny .
oh , it actually is if you get the joke .
it &apos;s based on the premise
that princeton isn &apos;t a very good school .
ha @-@ ha .
oh , see ? now he gets it .
okay , guys , go ahead
and divide yourselves into teams of two .
should we just do couples ?
couples sounds great .
or we could mix things up .
maybe pick names out of a hat .
whatever .
why don &apos;t you just admit
you don &apos;t want to be on a team with me .
i just said , &quot; couples sound great . &quot;
yeah , you don &apos;t think i &apos;m smart enough .
you think i &apos;m gonna be a liability .
even though i totally just used
the word &quot; liability &quot; correctly in a sentence .
yeah .
all right , let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s do couples .
i want to .
no , no , no .
let &apos;s mix things up .
i choose sheldon , and we &apos;re gonna kick your ass !
yeah ... really ?
the only time i &apos;m ever picked first for a team
and i &apos;m stuck with the liability ?
stop that . penny is not a liability .
thank you . do you want to be on my team ?
maybe we pick names out of a hat .
all right , hurry up and close the door
so they can &apos;t hear us .
would you stop pouting ?
so , you picked my name .
get over it .
yes , and do you know what the odds are
i &apos;d pick your name ?
no .
it &apos;s not hard-- one in five .
now you know why i &apos;m pouting .
all right , teams .
get ready to open your first puzzle .
go !
do you see what i did ?
the first puzzle is a puzzle !
oh , my god , how adorable is that ?
i wish i had a friend like me .
what are you doing ?
you have to start with the edges .
well , there &apos;s no right way , sheldon .
i already found a few pieces that fit .
yeah , well , take them apart and start with the edges .
and stop wasting time .
wow , you &apos;re really good at puzzles .
i did them all the time as a kid .
as my mom used to say ,
&quot; when you &apos;re doing a puzzle ,
it &apos;s like having a thousand friends . &quot;
she was full of fun lies like that .
if it makes you feel any better ,
my mom &apos;s just full of pound cake .
i &apos;m sorry you got stuck with me .
i bet you wanted to be with bernadette .
have you ever played a game with bernadette ?
no .
have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine ?
faster , faster , faster !
do you not know that word ?
it means &quot; more fast &quot; !
stop yelling at me .
hey !
you &apos;ll know when i &apos;m yelling at you .
ooh , ooh , it &apos;s the comic book store !
all right , come on .
that &apos;s where we have to go .
but we haven &apos;t finished the puzzle .
well , it @-@ it doesn &apos;t matter !
we know the answer ! come on .
you think you know the answer .
but it could be a trick .
what if when the puzzle &apos;s complete ,
there &apos;s a sign in the window that says ,
&quot; go to the train store &quot; ?
okay , it &apos;s not gonna say that .
well , i hope you &apos;re wrong .
i really want to go to the train store .
it &apos;s the comic book store .
let &apos;s go !
come on , numb nuts ,
it &apos;s the comic book store !
it &apos;s the comic book store , it &apos;s the comic book store ,
it &apos;s the comic book store !
it &apos;s the comic book store .
do you think penny &apos;s mad at me ?
because you &apos;re in the right lane behind a bus
and you won &apos;t go around it ?
i &apos;m sure she finds it charming .
no , because i didn &apos;t want her on my team .
i &apos;m starting to think she dodged a bullet .
the slowest bullet in the world .
geez , i never realized you were so competitive .
yeah , i know .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s probably because i grew up
with five brothers and sisters
so i had to fight for every ...
oh , my god , you did not just slow down for a bird !
you know they fly , right ? !
i think this is the first time we &apos;ve ever
actually been alone together .
huh , i guess you &apos;re right .
wonder why that is ?
well , off the top of my head ,
i &apos;d say we don &apos;t have a lot in common
except for the people we &apos;re involved with .
plus , when we first met ,
penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you .
yeah .
you know , i bet you and i have more in common than we think .
such as ?
i don &apos;t know .
tell me some things you like .
uh , let &apos;s see .
i like harps , little house on the prairie ,
medieval poetry , medieval literature ...
hey , how about some music ?
great .
sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car .
he doesn &apos;t want to be mistaken for a gang member .
find something you like .
beatles , boring .
eminem , scary .
weird al ?
活跃于上世纪80.90年代
how old are you ?
neil diamond ?
yeah , i love neil diamond .
i love neil diamond .
* sweet caroline *
* good times never seemed so good *
* so good , so good , so good *
* i &apos;ve been ... *
oh , hey , thanks for letting me use the comic book store
as part of the scavenger hunt .
oh , my pleasure .
always happy to help out with fun things
that i wasn &apos;t invited to be a part of .
oh , congratulations .
you &apos;re the first team to arrive .
yes ! it &apos;s not a ruse to make fun of me .
it &apos;s a real game and i &apos;m winning it !
your next puzzle is a riddle .
and who better to give it to you
than the riddler ?
总是会刻意留下谜语线索来玩弄蝙蝠侠还有警察
go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go ,
go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
how am i faster than you ?
i &apos;m wearing heels and i stopped to take a phone call .
i have asthma .
back off !
&quot; riddle me this .
&quot; arrah , arrah , and gather round ,
the work of this hero is legion @-@ bound .
he multiplies n by the number of he ,
and in this room the thing you &apos;ll see . &quot;
good riddle , huh ?
yeah .
so when you guys plan fun activities ,
does my name even ...
come up , or ... ?
i invited you to my murder mystery party .
no , you didn &apos;t .
we &apos;re the last ones here , hurry up !
it is a marathon , not a sprint .
people run in a marathon !
not with a bowling ball on their back .
hey , penny , i just wanted to say good luck ,
and i hope there &apos;s no hard feelings .
hey , romeo !
repair your relationship on your own time .
relax , it &apos;s a hard puzzle .
it &apos;s gonna take a while to solve .
&quot; riddle me this ... &quot;
got it .
hey , princeton , look at that ,
team community college night school is in the lead .
i thought we were the lightning sharks .
hey , you know what this could mean ...
oh , oh , that &apos;s good .
then this would be ...
that &apos;s it .
to the neil mobile !
i knew it , we &apos;re gonna lose !
wait , i got it . i got it !
congratulations , you got it last .
you &apos;re really mean , you know that ?
so no one &apos;s gonna buy anything .
okay ...
let &apos;s see .
&quot; to continue on your quest ,
leave no stone unturned . &quot;
the next clue must be hidden
under one of these rocks .
oh . okay .
sheldon , i @-@ i &apos;ve got to ask .
how did you figure out that it was the geology lab ?
oh , simple .
the &quot; arrah , arrah &quot; in the riddle meant jan arrah ,
a member of the legion of superheroes ,
known as element lad .
and then the word &quot; he , &quot;
it wasn &apos;t the masculine pronoun ,
but rather , &quot; h @-@ e , &quot;
the abbreviation for helium .
see where i &apos;m going with this ?
yes .
nice try .
now , element lad &apos;s ability
is the power to transmute chemical elements .
helium has an atomic number of two .
if you multiply that by the atomic number of &quot; n &quot; --
nitrogen--
you get 14 , which is the atomic number of ... ?
i &apos;m just funnin &apos; you , silicon .
and that is the most common element in the earth &apos;s surface .
so that narrowed it down
to the geology lab or the chemistry lab .
i can drink a beer underwater .
and i &apos;m sure your parents are proud .
now , finally ,
the line &quot; in this room the thing you &apos;ll see &quot;
was an obvious reference
to fantastic four member the thing ,
who &apos;s made entirely of ...
shut up .
i solved it .
those are map coordinates .
got &apos; em . let &apos;s go .
well , wait .
d @-@ don &apos;t you want to know how i figured it out ?
no one likes a know @-@ it @-@ all , penny .
* on the boats and on the planes *
* they &apos;re coming to america *
* never looking back again *
* they &apos;re coming to america *
um , i &apos;m okay with you driving my car .
i &apos;m not okay with you flying my car .
don &apos;t sweat it , my dad &apos;s a cop .
he can fix things .
like death ?
your kid may be an honor student
but you &apos;re a moron !
penny &apos;s not answering my texts .
who cares ? focus on the game .
this stupid game is why she &apos;s mad in the first place .
i &apos;m telling her i &apos;m quitting .
no !
quitting would be the worst thing
for your relationship .
why ?
because it would make you seem like
something she already thinks you are .
what does she think i am ?
how do i put this ?
she &apos;s been known to call you a name
that usually applies to a lady part .
or a cat .
or a willow .
银柳以及孬种 娘娘腔的含义
i can &apos;t believe she would say that about me .
if you &apos;re gonna cry about it
there &apos;s tissues in my purse .
unless you got some in yours .
big willow .
* they &apos;re coming to america *
* they &apos;re coming to america *
* today *
* today *
* today *
* today ! *
okay ... another 30 feet .
okay .
it &apos;s a bowling alley .
yes .
yes !
my brain is better than everybody &apos;s !
* love on the rocks *
* ain &apos;t no big surprise *
* just pour me a drink *
* and i &apos;ll tell you some lies ... *
call me a lady part .
we &apos;ll see about that .
can you reach the clue ?
almost .
hurry , sheldon and penny
were right behind us in the bowling alley .
got it !
great , climb back up .
come on !
yeah , penny might be onto something .
to the planetarium !
let &apos;s go !
to the tar pits !
let &apos;s go !
there &apos;s a neil diamond concert next month !
let &apos;s go !
three bags , no one &apos;s opened &apos; em .
we &apos;re the first ones here !
it &apos;s dirty laundry . you &apos;re up .
why me ?
because you &apos;ve been training for this your whole life .
you live in a pile of dirty laundry .
they &apos;re here first .
this is because you made me slow down for that blind guy .
okay , the clue must be in the bag .
the clue must be in the bag .
what &apos;s ... it &apos;s just a bunch of pants .
it &apos;s just a bunch of pants .
you know , i &apos;m surprised you want to copy my answers
since i &apos;m not even smart enough to be on your team .
well , why would you want to be on someone &apos;s team
who you like to call a ...
i can &apos;t even say it in front of sheldon .
what are you talking about ?
you know exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
i just made that up .
why would you do that ?
because you were about to quit like a big--
sheldon , cover your ears .
i &apos;m not a child .
i know the word &quot; ninny . &quot;
yeah , well , you should have quit
&apos;cause i &apos;m still gonna beat your ass .
wish i had a man like her on my team .
hey , i @-@ i am every bit
as much of a man as penny .
now , let &apos;s do this !
wait , it &apos;s not all pants , there &apos;s one shirt .
hey , that &apos;s my shirt .
this one is , too .
no , no , that &apos;s not mine .
that has a big spot on it .
but wait .
so does this one .
maybe the spot &apos;s the clue .
&quot; sheldon &apos;s spot . &quot;
the coin is in your spot !
oh , that &apos;s clever .
hurry !
be there in a minute .
i just have to pre @-@ soak these !
stop her , leonard ! stop her !
well , where the hell &apos;s the coin ?
wasn &apos;t the answer sheldon &apos;s spot ?
oh , yes , leonard .
yes , it was .
then where &apos;s the coin ?
yes , exactly .
where is the coin ?
why don &apos;t you look in your pockets ?
i slipped them in there earlier today .
i don &apos;t get it .
don &apos;t you see ?
when we &apos;re all having fun together ,
we &apos;re already winners .
oh , look .
see ?
even i &apos;m a winner .
are you kidding me ?
that is the stupidest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
you suck so hard .
well , i thought ...
come on , i didn &apos;t want anyone
to feel bad at the end of the game .
and some of those puzzles were really hard
and i didn &apos;t know who was gonna get penny .
run .
okay , okay , that @-@ that came out wrong ,
but you have to admit ,
you all had a wonderful time .
run to india .
i just wanted to do something beautiful !
hey , look .
