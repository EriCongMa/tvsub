at a police station .
i was the only one who saw the robbery .
i didn &apos;t want you to worry .
yeah , i &apos;ll call you back , hon . someone &apos;s here .
yeah , please call me back.- yes . bye .
it &apos;s okay if you want to finish your call .
no , i did . it &apos;s the wife , you know .
oh , yeah , i know .
hey , i &apos;m cary agos with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i wanted to thank you for helping us out here .
no problem .
why don &apos;t we talk in private ?
this is kind of a noisy room .
so , we may need you around for trial , mr. dolan .
you , uh , found a suspect ?
no , no , but if we do ,
we &apos;ll need you around for trial .
were you planning on going anywhere ?
me ? no . why ?
just you and your wife applied for passports last week .
ah , right .
uh , cabo .
pretty pricey ?
no .
no , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s my in @-@ laws .
oh , in @-@ laws .
so ... you told the officer
you didn &apos;t touch anything in the store ,
and you were just looking for a squirt gun for your son .
it &apos;s his birthday today .
why ?
well , it &apos;s just ...
the police , they dusted for prints ,
and they found yours on this display here .
ah , yes .
when i entered the store , i , um ,
i was looking at some of the greeting cards .
so you did touch something .
the display , yes . why ?
oh , just trying to figure out what happened .
so you wanted to buy a greeting card , not a toy ?
no , i @-@ i wanted to buy a toy .
so why did you touch the cards ?
is @-@ is there something wrong ?
i don &apos;t think so . is there ?
i think i &apos;d like to leave now .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t allow that , mr. dolan .
why ?
we &apos;re holding you for investigation .
mr. dolan , i &apos;m alicia florrick .
are you the public defender ?
no , i &apos;m registered with the city bar &apos;s pro bono program .
they referred your case .
but if you &apos;d prefer a public defender .
no .
this is crazy .
i know .
i saw a robbery
and they think because my fingerprints were on a display
that was thrown down , that i did it .
well , actually , mr. dolan , the police have an eyewitness
who saw you struggle with the clerk and shoot him .
that &apos;s not true . i don &apos;t ...
okay , listen , don &apos;t say a word to anyone .
okay ?
will you call my wife ?
they took my cell .
actually , don &apos;t call her .
i &apos;ll call her .
okay .
so are you following me now ?
just going where the pro bonos take me , cary .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d let me question him more .
i mean , he &apos;s innocent , right ?
thank you , mr. boylan .
are you ready ?
i guess i am .
okay , send the first one .
you take all the time you want .
may i help you ?
no , i &apos;m good .
there &apos;s going to be five total .
all right , walk to the line .
turn to your left .
touch the wall .
and turn back .
no . not him .
send in number two .
walk to the line .
were you wearing those glasses when you saw the murder ?
yeah .
turn to your left .
no , definitely not .
he was much thinner than that .
okay , send in number three .
number three , step forward .
stop on the line .
look in the lens .
don &apos;t move .
that &apos;s him .
are you sure ?
that &apos;s the man you saw struggling with the cashier ,
and firing two bullets into his head ?
yes .
definitely .
head back in , number three . thank you .
travis dolan ,
an unemployed former parks employee .
he &apos;s broke , about to be evicted .
he &apos;s mr. everyman , except this everyman
walks into a convenience store to rob it .
doesn &apos;t count on the cashier having a gun .
shoots him , kills him .
sees a passing patrol car pulling up .
puts his gun down , hides in the back of the store ,
pretending to be a witness .
prints on the gun ?
no usable prints , but a solid eyewitness .
no cash taken ?
didn &apos;t have time .
the patrol car surprised him .
there was a struggle , right ?
during the commission of a robbery .
you want second degree ?
offer second degree , i &apos;ll take it to him .
once again , i look for my liaison , but where is she ?
and once again , i have a job that sometimes takes me ,
oddly , out of the office .
so what , i handle this meeting on my own , is that it ?
you do . you &apos;re a big boy , eli .
and will and diane don &apos;t bite .
yeah , it &apos;s not them i &apos;m worried about .
okay , so here &apos;s my advice , eli :
don &apos;t bite them . okay ?
always the levelheaded one .
okay . i need you to work with me full @-@ time .
really ?
yes .
i need investigator time .
the law moves slow ; i move fast .
i &apos;m manangng three campaign crises right now ,
and the cheese lobby has just taken me on full @-@ time .
yes , the cheese lobby .
you &apos;re fast , you &apos;re a pro .
i need you full @-@ time .
they won &apos;t let me be full @-@ time .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m telling them .
i don &apos;t like sharing .
and between you and me ,
and whoever else you tell once i ask you
i need someone as investigator when i leave here .
for opposition research .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
it is going to happen ,
because i &apos;m going to make it worth your while .
more money , more power , more self @-@ reliance .
hello , eli . how are you ?
great . good .
will , how are you ?
i &apos;m good , eli . always a pleasure .
julius cain , head of litigation .
nice to meet you .
um , so , i &apos;ve hit the ground running ,
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re well aware ,
and now i think it &apos;s time to take a breath and reassess .
no !
ten minutes !
and i need both alicia florrick and kalinda--
what &apos;s your last name again ?
sharma .
sharma , dedicated to my department full @-@ time .
lobbying and crisis management are a 24 / 7 business ,
and i need 24 / 7 dedication .
no .
anything else ?
am i making you money ?
you are .
am i encouraging clients to keep political business in @-@ house ?
you are .
then i can &apos;t be splitting
alicia and kalinda &apos;s time with legal .
alicia is supposed to be at this meeting . where is she ?
she &apos;s on a case , a case that makes us money .
why don &apos;t we discuss this , eli ?
we take your concerns very seriously .
he &apos;ll stay because it &apos;s in his interest to stay .
it &apos;s only in his interest to stay if we encourage cooperation .
he doesn &apos;t want cooperation .
look at the numbers , will . the dairy people bring in
almost a as much as we lost last year .
but at what cost ? if we dedicate alicia to eli ,
what are we pulling her from ? how much money are we losing ?
well actually , at the moment alicia is working on a pro bono .
okay , why are we still doing pro bonos ?
because we &apos;re still a member of ...
and why am i the only one who &apos;s worried about the economy ?
we are heading into a double @-@ dip recession
without a bankruptcy department , without tax lawyers ,
and our lawyers , some of our best lawyers ,
are busy doing pro bono ?
i need to talk to you .
about ?
things .
the players .
the political crosscurrents .
really ?
you seem smart enough to figure that out .
i &apos;m smart enough to know
i need your help figuring it out .
we &apos;ve expanded , will , beyond our means .
yes , we &apos;re one of the few all @-@ service firms left standing ,
but we did it at a cost ,
and we can &apos;t continue this way .
what way ?
we need bankruptcy .
if there &apos;s one department that &apos;ll survive a double @-@ dip recession ,
it &apos;s bankruptcy .
to build one from the ground up would take time ,
but luckily enough , we can acquire one off the shelf .
how ?
there &apos;s a firm breaking up :
malpractice is going one way , acquisition another ,
bankruptcy , i just found out , is going with litigation .
oh , no .
yes . you need to talk to her .
we already said no .
we already said no
when we thought it was just litigation .
if it &apos;s litigation and bankruptcy ...
then you talk to her .
no . everybody &apos;s going to be vying for her bankruptcy department .
we need someone who has a preexisting relationship .
i don &apos;t even know where she is .
the midwest bar association .
celeste serrano is doing a seminar
in dispute resolution .
get us bankruptcy ,
and we won &apos;t have to dance to the tune of eli gold .
have you noticed , no matter how high we go ,
we &apos;re still dancing to someone &apos;s tune ?
welcome to leadership .
i don &apos;t want to see any lawyers pushing off their cle hours .
guess who &apos;s in town ? the midwest bar association .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
just get it over with .
i have one more item i want to talk about .
the department of justice has identified certain--
and i &apos;ll use their word--
&quot; biases &quot; in how we plea bargain .
so i &apos;ve agreed to the government &apos;s request
to detail an ausa to this office .
not to monitor us , but to work with us ,
and be as one of us .
so please welcome imani stonehouse . imani .
hello .
you &apos;re all under arrest .
okay , let &apos;s get going .
imani , i &apos;d like you to meet cary agos .
he &apos;ll be showing you the ropes .
he already has .
maximum sentence to a black drug dealer .
discount to a white killer .
okay , we &apos;re off to a great start .
the white defendant-- he had no priors .
and no crack .
oh , yeah . yep , you got me there .
big bad white prosecutor out to put down the black man .
and black woman .
&quot; ethics in law &quot; will begin in ten minutes
in conference room a.
please don &apos;t forget to sign in .
and remember to pick up your name cards .
will gardner .
what the hell are you doing here ?
hey , i &apos;ve got 30 hours of cle like everyone else .
well , come on up to the 34th floor
if you want to continue that legal education .
strippers and acquisitions .
maybe later .
so , um ... based on this ,
um , i believe , um ... um ...
it &apos;s not just , uh ...
should have known you &apos;d be here .
he &apos;s amazing , isn &apos;t he ?
the criminal mind ...
yeah .
you always hated him .
nope . just thought he was a bad boss .
you were jealous .
of ... ?
you did not .
after the staff meeting on 9 / 11 .
remember ? he was in tears .
you slept with him ?
we didn &apos;t do much sleeping .
oh , oh , okay , you can stop now .
you found out it wasn &apos;t only litigation .
the bankruptcy is coming with me .
so you here to charm me ?
to offer you a home .
and what about your lawyer friend alicia florrick ?
why isn &apos;t she here to charm me , too ?
what are you looking for ?
to come to lockhart / gardner ?
a three @-@ year commitment to litigation .
oh , come on .
and a five percent bump in salary
and a 50 / 50 split on the hammett aerospace .
the jetliner crash ? no .
mr. osterman .
remember me ? celeste .
oh , yes . how are you ?
in baltimore ?
oh , my goodness , yes .
excuse me .
a three @-@ year commitment to litigation ,
a five percent bump in salary and we &apos;ll call it a day .
we have other suitors .
i &apos;ll talk to diane .
until the economy improves ,
we &apos;re calling a halt to pro bonos .
plead out the ones you &apos;ve got ,
then we need everyone full @-@ time , back in the office .
cary &apos;s resisting a plea .
what &apos;s on the table ?
second degree . 20 years .
for a murder with an eyewitness ?
sounds like a worthy offer .
the client &apos;s resisting .
okay , i &apos;ll help out there .
you want me to talk to legal aid ?
no , i &apos;ll do it .
i at least owe them an explanation .
yeah . will . where are we ?
she wants 50 % on her jetliner class action .
she has the crew , we &apos;ve got the passengers .
35 % . maybe .
okay , tell celeste 35 % .
the way you usually do-- your charm .
i believe in you .
bye .
she &apos;s playing hard to get .
mr. dolan , how are you ?
i &apos;m okay , thank you .
i just , uh ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
no .
we love you .
can i , uh ...
no , not yet . no contact .
jakie , this all just a big mistake , all right ?
i &apos;ll be home soon and we &apos;ll celebrate your birthday ,
all right , kiddo ?
daddy loves you very much .
come on .
no record . not even a parking ticket .
that &apos;s why i offered second degree .
shave off another five years .
you haven &apos;t met my workmate , have you ?
imani ... imani stonehouse .
she &apos;s an ausa to make sure
there &apos;s no racial imbalance in plea bargaining .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on here ?
you &apos;re hard bargaining for , what , appearances ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just appearance , do you ?
i think it &apos;s another state &apos;s attorney preoccupation .
forgotten in a month .
i think he liked you .
what &apos;s the plan ?
turn the preliminary hearing into a poor man &apos;s deposition ,
get the prosecution to show their hand ?
judge isn &apos;t going to let that happen .
all rise !
the honorable francis flamm presiding .
no , no . everybody sit down , please .
justice tie @-@ dye ?
evelyn made a great zucchini bread ,
if anybody wants .
evelyn , quiet , hand it around .
come on .
uh , offer her flex time .
the option to telecommute .
tell her we &apos;ll find her a corner office .
we &apos;re out of corners .
where are you , football game ?
uh , yes , my midday treat to myself .
no . legal aid .
come on , diane , you don &apos;t have to break up in person .
just make a call .
uh , mr. coyne , please .
tell him it &apos;s diane lockhart .
yeah , well , that was the plan ,
but my guilt was getting to me .
guilt is for the weak .
go-- sweeten our offer .
the cashier pulled this gun from a holster he had under the counter .
then they just started firing .
and you were standing 20 feet from the window .
and how far was the shooter inside the store ?
your honor , again , objection .
this is a preliminary hearing .
the defense is using this as a poor man &apos;s deposition ,
to get a preview of our case .
yep .
heard it the first time , counselor .
got it .
overruled .
and how far was the shooter inside the store ?
he &apos;s killing us .
get used to it .
ten feet , probably ?
so , 30 feet in total ?
20 feet to the window , ten feet inside .
was he on the sidewalk or in the parking lot ?
and so i &apos;m curious , mr. boylan ,
were you on the sidewalk in front of the store ,
or in the parking lot ?
on the sidewalk .
on the sidewalk .
yep , i can see into the store .
there &apos;s no reflection problem .
where did he say the shooter went ?
where did this person go after you saw him shoot ?
back into the store to hide .
so you saw him hide ?
no , i &apos;m just ...
he went toward the rear of the store .
so maybe the real robber went out the back door .
objection !
it &apos;s one exit . punch @-@ key lock .
you need to know the code to get out .
damn .
detective , have you heard of cross @-@ racial identification ?
i have .
but you don &apos;t give it much credence .
well , do i think that some whites tend to
misidentify black suspects
because they have trouble distinguishing features-- yes .
but the eyewitness here was black and the accused white .
and have you seen studies that blacks often misidentify whites ?
i haven &apos;t , but i &apos;ll take your word for it .
didn &apos;t mr. boylan give a more general description of a white suspect ,
before he saw my client at your desk , being questioned ?
are you talking about the artist &apos;s sketch ?
i wasn &apos;t .
but sure .
uh ... continue , please .
and this artist sketch was done prior to mr. boylan &apos;s
seeing my client in the police station ?
yes , but i wouldn &apos;t call the description &quot; general . &quot;
isn &apos;t it possible that mr. boylan only fixated
on my client as the shooter ,
because he saw him being questioned by police ?
and couldn &apos;t this sketch direct you to the real killer ?
no . we have the real killer .
your honor ,
defense asks for access to this sketch .
seems like a reasonable request .
counselor ?
any trouble getting it to them ?
any more questions ? i got to get back to work .
uh , yeah , so you were here yesterday during the shooting .
yes . it was crazy .
the cops got here really fast .
people running around , screaming ...
and did you see anyone who looked like this ,
running around , screaming ?
i thought they caught the guy who did it .
no .
i don &apos;t know .
this looks like a hundred people .
do you mind ?
sure .
yeah . try and get the crime scene photos .
cops aren &apos;t giving me access .
we also would suggest , your honor ,
that it would be helpful to have access
to the crime scene photos .
they do have access , your honor , in discovery .
which we always get at the last minute .
because we have to prepare them , so it takes time .
well , who prepares it , counselor ?
give me their number .
maybe they can expedite it .
hey , tim , listen--
can you find out who bought a lottery ticket
from this bar code ?
you do know you &apos;re in the criminal law mixer ?
i like criminal .
the men are so ... straight .
so we &apos;re fine with a three percent bump
and a two @-@ year commitment to your litigators .
do you know what it means to feed the rat , will ?
do i ... ? no .
you can live your sweet little domesticated life .
you can date your cute little apple @-@ cheeked lawyer .
apple @-@ cheeked ?
but eventually , you have to feed the rat .
return to the wild .
oh , that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;re not going above three percent .
you need to feed the rat , will .
you are killing yourself trying to be normal .
i am normal .
mr. florrick , hi .
big fan .
hello .
i came here especially hoping to bump into you .
i think you know will gardner .
yes , i do . hi , will .
peter .
you two have so much in common , don &apos;t you ?
we do have a lot in common .
and how do you two know each other ?
us ? we ...
worked at the same firm together long time ago .
we did a lot more than that .
the baltimore firm : osterman , lee , canfield .
it was my first job out of college .
my first threesome was with will .
that &apos;s true .
what was her name again ?
celeste , okay .
well , you have to start somewhere .
so alicia florrick , huh ?
well , she works with will , she &apos;s married to you .
must be quite an arrangement . discuss .
it is quite an arrangement . yes .
any awkward moments ?
you mean besides this one ?
how many kids do you have , peter ?
two . boy and a girl .
i love boys and girls .
that &apos;s very domestic .
what ages ?
16 and 14 .
oh , that &apos;s a very good age . isn &apos;t that a very good age , will ?
me , i don &apos;t get kids .
i mean , i get why they &apos;re important , but ...
you get them if you got them .
really ? i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m too selfish .
have you ever met his kids ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
really ?
alicia never brought them to work ?
i think i &apos;ll head out .
it &apos;s good to see you , peter .
yeah .
who did you say you were with again ?
the lottery control board .
a lottery ticket was paid out yesterday for five dollars .
it should have been $ 500 .
well , that &apos;s my receipt all right .
but i bought it as a gift for my son .
oh . where &apos;s your son ?
oh , he moved
back here-- home-- few months ago .
lovely .
uh , mrs. silvestre , may i use your bathroom ?
oh , hi , dear .
did you have a nice day ?
there &apos;s a young lady here for you .
who ?
she &apos;s from the lottery control board .
where is she ?
hello ?
hello ?
i feel like you &apos;re cheating on me .
only for money .
you think that makes it better ?
between will and diane , who holds more power ?
it &apos;s equal .
it &apos;s never equal .
yeah .
diane has more power in criminal ,
and will in civil .
but diane controls the purse strings .
only by default .
will hates dealing with it .
but if will says no , is it real ?
often .
you &apos;re not helping much .
darn .
and this julius guy-- what about him ?
oh , he &apos;s head of litigation .
he doesn &apos;t like me .
why doesn &apos;t he like me ?
you &apos;re the new and shiny thing .
does it matter that he doesn &apos;t like me ?
no .
anybody else with power ?
david lee , family law .
and alicia-- where does she stand in all of this ?
yes ?
she &apos;s only a third @-@ year associate ,
but she matters .
because of her husband ?
various reasons .
she can persuade people .
people , as in will ?
what are you looking for , eli ?
the hierarchy .
usually , i can figure it out ,
but this place is like a mom @-@ and @-@ pop store .
it &apos;s all will and diane .
if you want to persuade diane ,
you persuade david lee .
if you want to persuade will ,
you persuade alicia .
and here comes your next customer .
okay . where are we ?
uh , according to the time @-@ coded register receipt here ,
this lottery ticket was redeemed seconds before the murder .
whose ticket ? mitch silvestre .
he &apos;s a manager from a fish market across the way .
as you can see ,
there is a slight resemblance between him and the artist sketch .
can you get more on silvestre ?
i &apos;m on him .
good . we need to delay in court .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m working on a pro bono . what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know . whoring myself out .
sort of miss you .
i sort of miss you , too .
well , what can we do about that ?
i don &apos;t know . what do you want to do ?
hey , let me call you back .
i &apos;ll be here .
okay . love you .
i said that ...
i know .
no , automatically . mechanically . i didn &apos;t mean anything .
will , don &apos;t worry about it .
i ... it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t care .
will , call me later .
right . good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
don &apos;t pout .
i &apos;m fine .
but you &apos;re not accepting my apology .
what do i got to do ?
bring us bankruptcy .
okay , i &apos;ll come clean .
you &apos;re not chasing me , will , i &apos;m chasing you .
you &apos;re chasing me ?
yes .
how you doing that ?
litigation and bankruptcy are , in fact , leaving the firm .
that is true .
so is tax and family law .
and we &apos;re all regrouping .
as what , a jazz combo ?
no , as a new firm .
and we want you .
celeste , i know you &apos;re a dreamer ,
and i know you like to live in your head ,
but what in your wildest dreams
would make you think i would leave my firm ,
one of the most prestigious in chicago ,
to come work for what is basically a start @-@ up ?
&apos;cause i have the one thing i know you want .
what ?
can &apos;t even guess ?
i can &apos;t even begin to guess .
i &apos;m happy where i am .
baseball commissioner .
it &apos;s the one thing george w. bush wanted more than the presidency .
don &apos;t play games with me .
i &apos;m not .
the league &apos;s our biggest client .
commissioner is getting on in years .
he needs a successor .
the successor &apos;s going to come from our firm .
you know baseball .
you know the law .
i don &apos;t believe you .
call some friends , will .
you know who to call .
look at me .
i &apos;m not making this up .
when i go all in , it &apos;s not with a stone @-@ cold bluff .
i got my dispute resolution seminar in ten minutes .

not judge powers , judge romano !
and tell her the brief is on its way .
all right , got it !
sorry about that . been in court all day .

thanks .
thank you for picking up the slack on the convenience store shooting .
i hear you have two lawyers on the case ?
i ... really ?
it &apos;s good to see ,
considering all the firms that are pulling back these days .
uh ... the hanley deposition &apos;s over there .
yes , well , actually ...
i need to talk to you about this , uh ...
guys , it &apos;s a go on the packer appeal .
see if you can pull up some u of c intern time .
ties ? gentlemen , you go to court , you wear a tie .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
i &apos;m sorry . uh ...
i know this , uh ... might not be a great time
for this but we have to , um ...
our firm is bowing out of our pro bono obligations .
just till things pick up . you know , the economy .
i get it . don &apos;t worry about it .
thank you for fighting for us , anyway .
well , i mean we hope to return when things improve .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re not sure we &apos;ll be here .
we lost our funding .
you ... what , your state funding ?
yeah . budget crunch .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , we still have a few options , so ...
such as ?
such as knocking on a few doors .
yelling at a few rich people .
one thing i &apos;ve learned in the not @-@ for @-@ profit world is that
eventually , someone steps up .
well , i @-@ i should go .
yes , thanks .
you know , it &apos;s good to finally meet you in person .
and you .
i wish , uh ...
i don &apos;t know what i wish .
the world were different .
that sounds good ! i &apos;ll be here waiting .
will gardner , what the hell took you so long ?
come on in .
you don &apos;t want to miss the q and a.
no , thanks .
i &apos;m looking for , um , dispute resolution , neutrality something or other .
next door on the right .
hey . look who &apos;s here .
saved you a seat .
do you need help ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m on him now .
alcoholics anonymous ?
yeah . mitch goes to meetings twice a week .
what about the cash in the envelope ?
legit . he was chapter treasurer .
he likes to bet at the track , but it was all of his own money .
still doesn &apos;t mean he wasn &apos;t the killer .
yeah , but this does .
i checked the register at the convenience store .
it &apos;s an hour fast .
it could be an accident ,
or it was monkeyed with to run a lottery scam .
it still puts him at the store an hour before the murder .
we can still tell a story .
the guy worked a few doors down .
he knew the code to the locks .
a 30 @-@ year @-@ old who likes to gamble .
whose financial situation is bad enough it forces him to move home .
uh , i appreciate that we &apos;re trying to find a fall guy ,
but putting this on an innocent man ?
isn &apos;t that how our client got into this mess ?
we &apos;re defending our client .
all rise !
the honorable francis flamm presiding .
well , good morning , everyone .
it &apos;s good to see you all here again .
oh , and i see we &apos;ve grown by one at the defense table .
yes , we have , your honor .
i &apos;ve been so moved by the plight of mr. dolan
that i have decided to lend my assistance .
well , it &apos;s great to have you in my court , ms. lockhart .
and i understand your team would like to argue a motion to dismiss .
yes , your honor .
the prosecutor has built this case on one weak reed :
a single eyewitness .
an eyewitness who was 30 feet from the crime
and who only identified our client
after seeing the police questioning him .
mr. dolan has no record .
he has a wife and a son who are here in this court right now .
he is an innocent man , your honor .
and it would be unjust not to dismiss these charges .
let me .
let you , what ?
argue .
your honor ,
injustice comes in all shapes and sizes .
it &apos;s not just in the man held , it &apos;s also in the man released .
my grandfather once said ,
&quot; a judging brain requires a listening ear . &quot;
i think that was true then , but it &apos;s doubly true now .
you need to hear our full case before you can decide .
to dismiss before you hear would be an injustice .
your grandfather is the reverend roy stonehouse ?
he is , your honor .
well , i &apos;m honored .
how is he ?
he &apos;s good .
uh , recovering .
well , please tell him how greatly he &apos;s admired .
my first thesis i wrote was on selma .
i &apos;ll tell him .
and convey my respect , as well .
we all owe men like your grandfather a huge debt .
but let &apos;s not forget that this case is about an innocent man .
well , i think that still needs to be determined ,
don &apos;t you , counselor ?
yes .
what i meant , your honor ...
yes , it &apos;s all right . i know what you meant .
i just think that it would be unjust to summarily dismiss this case
before offering &quot; a listening ear . &quot;
and so , your motion is denied , ms. lockhart--
and the other two with you .
uh , we will move directly to trial .
oh , and , uh , ms. stonehouse , thank you .
i have chills .
i don &apos;t like to use that much .
does it get you into restaurants ?
i &apos;m out .
oh , come on .
not when you &apos;re up like that .
yep , when i &apos;m up like that .
we &apos;ll be here tonight .
after the civil mixer .
i &apos;m fine , thanks .
take you to breakfast ?
no .
geez , you sound so definitive .
yep .
so , i &apos;ll hear from you on the baseball commissioner job ?
celeste , no .
i didn &apos;t like this life , not even when i was living it .
i didn &apos;t like not knowing when i was being conned or conning .
you don &apos;t think there &apos;s a job ?
no , i checked . in ten or 15 years ,
there &apos;s a chance i could vie for baseball commissioner .
what a sad thought that is .
losing what i love now to chase something in the future .
what do you love ?
you said , &quot; losing what i love now . &quot;
my job !
i don &apos;t believe you .
i don &apos;t believe you love it .
what you love is winning .
and you can &apos;t win big enough at lockhart @-@ gardner .
this is your dream .
what happened to pursuing your dream ?
what happened to work ?
not everybody can pursue their dreams .
someone has to work .
whoa . that is so sad .
no . not really .
take care .
that &apos;s the cashier &apos;s bay .
and that &apos;s where the shooter was .
and the line of sight checks out .
i &apos;m not seeing what &apos;s good .
the line of sight checks out
until the cashier reaches under the counter for the gun .
the wall would &apos;ve hidden the cashier from view .
and boylan told the police the cashier pulled the gun
from a holster taped under the counter .
but he couldn &apos;t have seen him
reach under the counter for his gun .
unless he was in the store .
boylan tried to escape , saw a patrol car pull up ,
and pretended to be an eyewitness , not a killer .
so , let &apos;s go talk to cary .
only a few more minutes .
i &apos;ve always waited for bad things to happen .
every day .
travis sees the good things .
and i &apos;m always waiting for the bad .
well , this is good .
i know .
i don &apos;t want to be that anymore .
the worst thing happened , and we &apos;re still here .
will you thank the other two lawyers ?
oh , i will , but it was really the prosecutor .
he reversed himself .
can i ... ?
oh . yes .
hey , buddy .
how &apos;s it going ?
yes ?
oh , nothing .
i &apos;m , uh , just looking .
an espresso machine would be nice .
oh , hey . the release went well ?
it did . you should &apos;ve been there .
no , i didn &apos;t do enough .
how was whoring ?
unproductive .
listen , about what i said yesterday ...
will , please .
i &apos;m on the phone with my kids and i say , &quot; i love you , &quot;
and then i &apos;m on the phone with my mother @-@ in @-@ law
and i say , &quot; i love you , &quot; too .
it &apos;s an accident .
yes .
but do you think we should talk ?
no , i don &apos;t , actually .
you don &apos;t ?
no .
you sure ?
i &apos;m so sure .
i &apos;ve never been so sure .
i &apos;m not interested in anyone else .
will ...
you &apos;re talking about it .
no fuss , no muss .
that &apos;s me .
celeste serrano is forming her own firm .
bankruptcy ,
litigation , family law .
i don &apos;t want to be careful anymore .
i don &apos;t want to count every penny
and worry more about failing than doing what &apos;s right .
okay .
legal aid is losing its office space .
everybody &apos;s pulling back because of the economy .
i want to bring them in @-@ house .
there &apos;s room next to eli .
he won &apos;t like it , but
he &apos;ll have to live with it until we find more room .
when our lawyers have free time ,
they can offer it to legal aid .
you should &apos;ve broken up on the phone .
i want to do this .
and i want your okay .
