are you looking at naked tribeswomen ?
no , look .
that &apos;s a pig .
i know . but look at the knobs on it !
emily &apos;s cousin kicked me out .
what ?
why ?
when you sublet from your wife &apos;s cousin ... then you divorce ,
sometimes the cousin wants his apartment back .
didn &apos;t you sign a lease ?
who needs a lease when it &apos;s &quot; family &quot; ?
you can stay with us .
we &apos;ll take care of ya ! oh , yeah ! absolutely !
anything you need man !
but you have to let us know when you feel better so we can make fun of your hair .
yeah
you got it .
thanks , i really appreciate this .
i &apos;m going to get packing again .
i &apos;ve been moving around so much that i feel like a nomad .
what ?
he thought you said gonad .
the one where ross moves ln
if every place were this clean ,
i &apos;d have a tough time making a living .
oh , larry !
do health inspectors work on commission ?
no , bribes .
it &apos;s okay to laugh ?
i was just kidding.-okay
i &apos;ll check the kitchen floor .
okay , knock yourself out.larry
i don &apos;t get violations .
you could eat beans off that floor .
but don &apos;t , because that &apos;d be a violation .
yummy !
larry ?
yeah , i &apos;d let him check out my kitchen floor .
a ninety @-@ eight .
i deducted two points for not wearing your hat.that is a section 5 violation .
now look , larry , honey .
i wrote the book on section 5.you only need to wear it in the kitchen .
where &apos;s your hat ?
ln the kitchen . i &apos;ll get it .
there &apos;s the two points !
you should really read that book you wrote .
you saw the hat in the kitchen
and knew she &apos;d go in hatless to get it .
you could have your own health inspector detective show .
i don &apos;t know about that .
but then i could be your sidekick , voonda .
maybe i could ask voonda to dinner sometime ?
she would love that ...
... since you know all the clean places to eat .
i &apos;ll call you.okay
he &apos;s so funny !
thank you .
how &apos;s ross doing since all the emily stuff ?
he &apos;s not great .
but he &apos;s dealing with it .
wait , you &apos;re not ... -oh honey please , no
i can &apos;t get started with all that ross stuff again .
he &apos;ll be screwed up for a long time .
besides , i don &apos;t go for guys right after they get divorced .
right , you only go for them five minutes before they get married .
two pounds of mocha java .
it &apos;s danny.are you going to go out again ?
i don &apos;t know .
he hasn &apos;t called since we went out .
i see him in the hallway . we flirt .
i &apos;m all ha @-@ ha @-@ ha @-@ ha , and then nothing .
hey
hi danny
wow , thirsty .
i &apos;m having a party on saturday . sort of a housewarming thing .
fun .
great !
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
yeah
okay , see you !
so i guess we won &apos;t be warming his house .
all right , i see what he &apos;s doing .
he &apos;s not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out .
and you won &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s right !
because that would give him the control .
so now he comes up with this &quot; i &apos;ve got a party &quot; thing ... to get me to hint for an invitation
blew up in his face , didn &apos;t it ?
so there is no party ?
no , there &apos;s a party . there &apos;s a party .
but the power ? that is still up for grabs .
you follow me ?
i think so .
so he won &apos;t invite you to his party because he likes you ?
exactly !
then why didn &apos;t he invite me ?
to throw me off .
ross
hey , roomies !
i love what you &apos;ve done with the place .
i know it &apos;s a lot of boxes .
i appreciate you letting me stay here .
not a problem .
since you &apos;ll be here a while .... we could put your name on the answering machine .
oh yeah @-@ i hope you don &apos;t mind ...
but i kind of already jazzed it up a little .
check it out .
we will we will call you back
pretty cool .
you &apos;re fake laughing too , right ?
the tears are real .
you look beautiful this evening .
show me the badge again .
shiny .
you mind if i wash up ? because i came straight from work
and who knows where these babies have been ?
you are just nonstop !
we &apos;re out of here .
why ?
just walking past the kitchen i saw 1.0 violations .
i &apos;m shutting this place down !
you have the power to do that ?
this does .
shut it down .
hey
what are you doing ?
nothing .
you built a fort , didn &apos;t you ?
kind of .
oh , my god ! the air purifier . ross &apos; air purifier .
all i heard for four years through college was ....
you should have gone out once in a while .
i hate this thing !
come on , chandler.ross is our friend .
he needs us right now .
so why don &apos;t you be a grownup and come watch tv in the fort ?
can &apos;t believe that larry closed down churman &apos;s . i love that place .
you should have heard about all their violations .
larry said that they should call it vermin &apos;s .
that guy just plain kills me .
oh hi danny
i wanted to invite you to the party .
thanks , i &apos;ll try to stop by .
actually , i think i &apos;m going to be busy .
you are ?
remember , i &apos;ve got that gala ?
what &apos;s the gala for ?
it &apos;s a regatta gala .
do you sail ?
no , but i support it .
i hope i see you tomorrow night .
okay
take care .
walked right into that one , didn &apos;t he ?
what one ?
you wanted him to invite you and he did .
he waited until the last minute .
so if i said yes ...... he &apos;d know i had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation to his stupid party .
but i said no ... which puts me back in the driver &apos;s seat .
great . so the ball is in his court ?
ball ? no , there &apos;s no ball .
hey , phoebe , you want to join us ?
oh , sure , yeah . where is this from ?
it &apos;s from sun ling &apos;s .
oh , larry just told me something about sun ling .
oh , no , thank you .
joey , please .
sorry .
hello , children .
you want to play some foosball ? please ?
okay.-no ...
we moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.come on !
i have one question .
what is the deal with this ?
bye @-@ bye , little puppet joey hand ?
no , the quiet down thing .
you mean this .
i don &apos;t know how much more i can take .
did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with a show about bugs ?
my god ! what if that had been porn ?
all right , this may be tough but it &apos;s ross .
i survived college with him .
i guess i can hold out a little longer .
let &apos;s have a game .
no ... yes !
fellas ?
so he &apos;s out of here .
got anything to eat ?
i went to jono &apos;s for some chicken and it was closed .
i took larry there , but it was all violated , so we shut it down .
if this guy keeps closing our favorite places ,
where will we eat ?
i don &apos;t know . clean places ?
yum !
it &apos;s danny .
don &apos;t let him in ! i &apos;m supposed to be at a gala .
we &apos;ll be right there .

what kind of a regatta gala starts at night ?
the fake kind .
i need a ladle . you got a ladle ?
we have a ladle .
thanks , see you at the party.-okay
you know what larry would say ?
he &apos;d say , &quot; see you ladle . &quot;
i &apos;m done . you want anything ? sports ? international ? apartment listings ?
i &apos;ll take sports.mine !
all right , international.that &apos;s mine too .
i &apos;m ltalian .
i could check apartment listings , though there &apos;s never anything here .
not even on page seven ?
you &apos;re right .
here &apos;s an affordable place.two @-@ bedroom , close to work .
it &apos;s available in five weeks .
what about that circled one ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s kind of expensive for a studio .
but it &apos;s available now .
isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
let &apos;s go look at it !
okay , there we go !
oh @-@ oh @-@ ooh , hey guys ,
i was wondering if you guys would uh , maybe chip in on some new air filters for the purifier ?
i mean , after all , we are all using it .
let &apos;s go quicker !
oh , my god !
look at this kitchen / bathroom .
that &apos;s great ! so you can cook while in the tub .
somebody was using his head .
let &apos;s check out the rest of the place .
i think this is it .
i don &apos;t know . maybe we should keep looking .
but this place is available now .
you don &apos;t want to be stuck with us for five weeks .
yeah
so you think i should take this place ?
it &apos;s perfect !
how about you ?
kitchen , slash , bathroom .

could we get a bathtub in our kitchen ?
ready for dinner ?
absolutely .
great .

i love that place !
so , no .

how long has that milk been sitting out ?
no , this place is totally healthy .
this milk is mine .
i bought this today ... because i was thirsty for milk , you know ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
hey , buddy .
are you familiar with section 11 @-@ b of the health code
that requires all refuse material out the back exit ?
but then i &apos;d have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place .
so you &apos;re saying you &apos;d choose convenience over health ?
would you be interested in a free coffee ?
stop , larry .
can &apos;t you just be larry and not larry the health inspector guy ?
it was exciting at first .
but now , it &apos;s like , so where are we going to eat ever ?
i suppose i could give him a warning .
thank you .
go , go !
if , after dinner , you still need to bust someone ...
... i know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose .
maybe we did good , helping ross get back on his feet .
that was a nice place .
no closet space , but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag .
yeah
what do we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe pizza ?
about ross !
