an hour ago i resigned as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
i want to be clear . i have never abused my office .
alicia ,
i know this has been hard on you ,
but you have to believe me ... i &apos;m innocent .
he needs you to forgive him , alicia .
jackie , he took everything i thought we had
and he just put it out there for everyone .
he didn &apos;t want that . the press ...
oh , jackie , stop it .
peter wasn &apos;t thinking of us .
kalinda sharma .
i &apos;m the in @-@ house .
oh , the investigator .
you &apos;re peter florrick &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s right .
brian thinks there &apos;s a good chance
the appellate court &apos;s going to listen to my case .
if they overturn it , everything goes back to normal .
peter , it &apos;s never going back to normal .
this was after you dropped your kids off at school ?
yes .
this was on the 16th ?
yes .
and who first told you of your husband &apos;s infidelity ,
mrs. florrick ?
cnbc .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t understand .
i was at the cleaners .
i was waiting in line .
cnbc was playing on the tv .
i saw it on the crawl at the bottom of the screen .
and , just so we &apos;re clear ,
you never once suspected your husband &apos;s infidelity
before that moment , is that correct , mrs. florrick ?
that &apos;s correct .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry to ask these personal questions ,
but i &apos;m really on your side ,
and as your husband &apos;s attorney ,
our appeal depends on proving that your husband made
untruthful statements at work ,
not because he was trying to cover up
illegal acts as a state &apos;s attorney ,
but that he was trying to hide an affair from his wife .
you understand ?
i understand .
good .
let &apos;s turn to the call girl .
she made some statements in the press .
alicia florrick .
when ?
are you sure you need me now ?
um ... i &apos;ll call your office to arrange
to do this another time ?
i just want to let you know that peter has a lot of friends .
judges , lawyers , business folk
who didn &apos;t like the way that this went down .
they want to help .
i &apos;m just saying if you need anything ,
day or night ,
give me a call ?
we &apos;re fine .
ah , one more thing .
we &apos;re looking for correspondence
that may have taken place between peter and a gerald kozko .
just like the store , only with a &quot; k &quot; and a &quot; z . &quot;
the real estate developer .
peter says all of his private correspondences
are at your apartment .
it would help a lot
if you could look for a letter or a card from him .
that &apos;s it .
dentist visit ... is over .
alicia .
i heard you were coming on board to replace bree .
could you ... ?
sure .
ah , talk about complicated .
jury selection took a week .
we got five more of these
filled with medical testimony and the depo dump .
did you read that ?
i was on will &apos;s felony case till 30 minutes ago .
yeah , i was on a slip @-@ and @-@ fall
until diane yanked me on this .
it &apos;s just &quot; all hands on deck , &quot; you know ?
but this one &apos;s pretty cool ,
so come on , i &apos;ll get you up to speed .
and what is an ironman , ray ?
running , biking , ocean swimming .
you swim 2.4 miles ,
bike 112 miles ,
and then run a full marathon .
and you placed third in the hawaiian ironman ,
is that correct ?
yes , i did , yeah .
so tell me what happened on the 12th ,
ray .
well , it was right after the ironman .
we were back at the hotel ,
and i felt this migraine coming on ,
so i took these ... pills my doctor prescribed me
and the migraine just ...
seemed to be getting worse .
ray demory .
he &apos;s our test case .
if diane wins this one ,
there &apos;s a massive class action in the wings .
i felt unsteady .
the next day at the hospital , i found out i had a stroke .
and these pills you took-- they were zennapril , correct ?
your honor ...
the drug manufactured by these
three gentlemen over here .
there &apos;s nothing i enjoy more than watching
miss lockhart perform
her courtroom magic ...
james mccloon-- killer defense counsel .
they call him the velvet shiv .
... my clients manufactured zennapril ,
and stop poking at them like perps
on america &apos;s most wanted .
funny ,
i didn &apos;t hear an objection , your honor .
let &apos;s just please refrain from the crosstalk .
yes , your honor .
i will try not to interrupt miss lockhart again .
it will be difficult ,
but i will try .
so , ray ,
how would you describe your physical condition now ?
you &apos;re looking at it .
mostly it &apos;s been hard on carol .
we got married a year ago , for my stroke , and she ...
she didn &apos;t buy into this .
i mean ...
one day her husband &apos;s an ironman
and the next day he &apos;s a ...
an invalid .
brandon , lahna , you take point on legal precedent .
cary , you take alicia and review anything
that could undercut the class action .
i don &apos;t want to win the battle and lose the war .
use kalinda if you need to , okay ?
let &apos;s get to it .
mrs. demory .
can i get you something ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
sorry , must have had a zombie look on my face .
no , no , no .
we all need a moment .
i &apos;m alicia .
right , you replaced bree .
nice to meet you .
oh , this .
this is what keeps us going .
michael graff .
he took zennapril after a little league game .
jenny hollis .
she was a dancer .
they all wrote you ?
yes .
138 of them .
i ...
sorry .
just ...
they &apos;re all counting on us , you know ?
if we don &apos;t win , they &apos;re stuck .
it &apos;s just a lot of responsibility , you know ?
objection . relevance .
isn &apos;t it the case ,
mr. demory , the only reason you &apos;re not suing your doctor is
because his pockets aren &apos;t as deep as my client &apos;s ?
objection ! your honor !
can we have a ruling ?
please , your honor .
approach the bench .
get me all references
to secondary prescriptions in ray &apos;s deposition .
right .
kalinda , i need you to look into this .
so , what are you saying ? someone &apos;s bribing a juror ?
i &apos;m not saying anything .
i just found it .
look , this could be anything .
a seating chart for a garden party ,
a football lineup .
with 12 linemen ?
what &apos;s that ?
yep .
we should talk to the hostess ,
see if anyone from the court eats here regularly .
no , we should take a deep breath , show this to diane ...
... only spot in chicago not stuffed full of yuppies .
been coming here three times a week ...
i don &apos;t think we need to talk to the hostess .
i come here so often ,
i asked them to name a sandwich after me .
waitress looked me dead in the eye and said ,
&quot; we don &apos;t serve ham . &quot;
it could be anything .
it could be just a doodle .
we don &apos;t know .
and you found it in our depositions ?
yes , but it could have been on the floor and stuck to one .
we just thought it should be brought to your attention .
remember last year ?
yep .
was mccloon ever cleared of that ?
it &apos;s still up for review .
so you think we should-- what ?
don &apos;t go to the judge .
it makes no sense .
how does it end up in our depos ?
mccloon sticks it in there .
he wants a mistrial ,
but he wants us to go to the judge and request it .
or he &apos;s just screwing with your head .
there &apos;s another possibility .
there &apos;s a young associate on his team-- a redhead .
she came over and introduced herself this morning .
said she worked as a paralegal here last summer .
so , what , mccloon has a whistle @-@ blower in his midst ?
young , idealistic junior associate
sees something wrong ,
feels bad about it ,
slips us a warning in our depos .
i could see that .
okay , this is what we do .
we do our homework and look into juror number two .
and juror number 11 .
mm @-@ hmm . or juror number 11 .
we go to the judge if we have anything .
you don &apos;t want a mistrial , right ?
no . ray was good on the stand .
the jury liked him .
and mccloon &apos;s defense seems to be a variation
on holding his breath and threatening to turn blue .
this trial is sounding more and more fun .
let &apos;s see if you got a bad juror on your hands .
put in for an alternate .
okay . i &apos;ll put kalinda and cary on it .
excuse me ...
but i &apos;d like to do this .
okay .
juror number two is marilyn wolk ,
a hairdresser from south bridgeport .
we scored her an 85 positive on our bias scale ,
one of the highest scores we &apos;ve ever given ,
so we believe she &apos;s firmly in your camp .
now , i know that you pay me only to help select jurors ,
but if i knew what you were after ,
i could offer further consultation .
no .
this is good .
keep going .
uh , juror number 11 is calvin tober .
he &apos;s a grad student in comparative history .
we scored him only a 62 % positive
on our bias scale--
well within the range of acceptability ,
but we like him .
being african @-@ american , he &apos;s more prone
to mistrust authority .
he &apos;s intelligent , but not to the point of overcoming bias .
not like asians or mexicans .
we talk in racial stereotypes because you pay us to ,
and we find racial profiling works .
but if i &apos;m not needed ...
you &apos;re not needed .
thank you .
you &apos;ve got issues ?
paying her $ 100,000 for three months
of high school @-@ level psychology--
yeah , i guess i do have issues .
okay .
so , what are we thinking ?
wolk worked as a rent @-@ a @-@ chair hair stylist , right ?
which means she only gets paid when she actually has a customer .
she could have claimed financial hardship
and ducked jury duty .
so why didn &apos;t she ?
civic duty ?
jury tampering pays better .
okay .
but let &apos;s look into both .
okay .
hi . i hate to trouble you ,
but i &apos;m from the next building over
and the delivery man left this at my door by mistake .
is there a mr. tober in the building ?
hi .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
my name &apos;s kalinda , and my husband and i
were thinking of buying a home in the area .
i can always come back later ,
if you know what time he gets home .
we &apos;re interested in the preschool
around the corner and ...
... or anyone else in his family .
i just wanted to get a sense of the neighborhood .
tober , i think his name is .
usually , i don &apos;t like black people much ,
but he seems nice .
they &apos;re the wolks .
she &apos;s a hairdresser .
and he &apos;s ... actually , i think he &apos;s out of work .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry to hear that . mmm .
hard times , isn &apos;t it ?
but their house is so lovely .
looks like they put a lot into it .
storm windows in front
and air @-@ conditioning ...
they bought a car , too .
guess they came into some money .
hey , there he is now .
that &apos;s the husband ... derek .
oh , gosh !
i &apos;m sorry .
i forgot .. i have to meet the realtor . oh !
thanks so much for your time .
objection , your honor .
is this really necessary ?
the demorys are seeking damages
for loss of consortium , your honor .
the jury needs to understand that loss .
counsel ...
sir , the term , &quot; consortium &quot; is not limited ...
i know what the term consortium means .
counselors , please .
i have prided myself in not using my gavel once
in my 30 years on the bench ...
what &apos;s going on ?
... but you are truly making me reconsider .
what ?
now , miss lockhart ,
i just ... overruled .
i heard you were on
some hush @-@ hush project . what is it ?
it &apos;s hush @-@ hush .
mrs. demory ,
before your husband &apos;s stroke ,
how often did you have sexual relations ?
i don &apos;t know .. i guess ...
twice a week .
and since the stroke ,
how often do you have sex ?
i don &apos;t know .
would you say it was less ?
yes .
less .
but your husband
isn &apos;t completely paralyzed from the waist down , is he ?
no .
no , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just ...
angry at myself for letting him get to me .
well , it &apos;s hard when they treat your private life
like a crime scene .
yeah .
but i guess there are ... greater tragedies .
alicia florrick .
ah . alicia .
i &apos;m glad i got you . it &apos;s daniel .
who ?
peter &apos;s lawyer .
oh , hi .
do you have a minute ?
actually , i &apos;m a bit busy .
i was just wondering if you had
a chance to look for the kozko letters .
we &apos;re struggling with these weekend meetings
that he had with peter ,
um , last march .
uh , the ninth , the 16th and the 25th .
i haven &apos;t looked yet .
anything that will show
that peter did not know , going into those meetings ,
there was something untoward will help us .
oh , uh ...
alicia , um ...
i was chatting with the headmaster at briarcrest on another matter ,
and he mentioned that they have scholarships for your kids .
mr. golden .
yes ?
don &apos;t . please .
yes .
i &apos;m sorry .
$ 35,000 can buy you a lot of stuff .
that &apos;s a bit tenuous , isn &apos;t it ?
her husband works at mccloon &apos;s firm ?
look , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s a smoking gun .
i &apos;m just saying that she didn &apos;t put it on her voir dire ,
so if we wanted to get rid of her , we can .
i say we bring it to diane and see what she says , okay ?
thanks . bye .
zach , give me back the remote !
we &apos;ve already seen this one .
shh . not so loud .
i don &apos;t hear the front door .
is she gone ?
oh , i thought for sure she suspected something .
zach , give me the camera .
i &apos;m not alone in this . i am not alone in this .
it wasn &apos;t even my idea !
let &apos;s go !
hurry up .
yeah .
okay .
here we go .
put a lot of this on , right ?
do we have sprinkles ?
hurry up . she &apos;s coming back .
what the heck do you do ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a little too thick .
all right ... i &apos;m gonna do a little surgery .
i just wanted to lay on it a little ...
you know what i mean ?
straighter .
yeah , push it ...
i know , but it &apos;s sticking to the bottom .
dad , you were supposed to get rose petals
already petaled , not roses .
i know , but this is what i have .
dad , that looks ...
okay . how does that look ?
that looks terrible .
oh , my gosh .
that looks expensive .
there goes your college education .
okay , let &apos;s get ready .
the day you were talking about .. the 16th ..
the day he was supposedly with kozko ...
well , he couldn &apos;t have been .
he was with us the whole day .
okay .
i &apos;ll bring it by your office ... 30 minutes .
hey , jackie ?
i &apos;m heading out .
oh , but i &apos;m making dinner .
that &apos;s big .
where did this come from ?
well , it was on the doorstep .
i think it &apos;s from your work .
please think of us as family . --daniel golden
it &apos;s very nice of your firm , wasn &apos;t it ?
uh , dear , what ...
alicia , what are you doing ?
what else was in the basket ?
i don &apos;t know . bananas .
anything else ?
i don &apos;t know .
cookies ?
oh , good . i &apos;m so glad .
uh ... you have the tape ?
well , yes .
and something else , too .
a gift .
what is it ?
ham , ipods ,
some half @-@ eaten bananas .
don &apos;t you ever try to buy me .
and don &apos;t you ever try to buy my kids .
you understand that ?
we &apos;re still working on the other juror--juror number eleven .
and we &apos;re not saying that juror number two was definitely bought off .
we just think that based on appearances
and the fact that it just takes one bad juror
to toss out a favorable verdict ,
we should use that as pretext
to bump juror number two and put in the alternate .
they make a good point .
better to be safe than sorry .
what does the jury consultant say about the alternate ?
the alternate &apos;s a republican .
not as good for us as the current juror .
so what if juror number two wasn &apos;t bought off ?
i &apos;ve just replaced a good juror
with a bad alternate .
so , smoke mccloon .
bring the potential bias to the judge ,
but don &apos;t insist on replacing juror two .
just bring it up .
and if mccloon goes crazy ,
you know she was bought ,
and fight for her expulsion .
and mccloon doesn &apos;t go nuts ?
just say you were following your duty
as an officer of the court .
back off .
it &apos;s your call .
we don &apos;t know what this means , your honor .
we just know it wasn &apos;t in juror number two &apos;s voir dire .
i don &apos;t even look at the guards at my reception .
i go straight down to the parking garage .
i don &apos;t understand , miss lockhart
do you want juror number two off the jury or not ?
well , we &apos;re undecided , your honor .
we merely felt an obligation
to bring it to the court &apos;s attention .
hey , if miss lockhart has any hesitation at all ,
i say let &apos;s dump her .
of course , we are willing to stipulate
to the fairness of this .
let &apos;s just put in the alternate .
we have no objection , your honor.-all right , fine .
juror number two is out .
we &apos;ll put in the alternate .
we got played .
what happened ?
it was a mccloon setup .
he put the placemat in our depose
to get us to dump our best juror .
we don &apos;t know that .
mccloon didn &apos;t fight it .
he welcomed it .
he wanted number two off the jury .
right .
because we were wrong .
it wasn &apos;t number two .
it was number eleven .
or it was no one .
okay , maybe .
but we find out .
i don &apos;t know .
we thought number two looked guilty
because she wanted to serve on a jury .
but she was just being a good person .
so ?
so , if that x was on juror number five
or eight or anyone ,
we would pry into their lives
and we would find something ,
because from the outside people look guilty .
yeah , and sometimes ,
people from the outside look guilty
because they are guilty .
i mean , what &apos;s your point ? we don &apos;t look ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t like prying .
then don &apos;t .
let me .
oh , thank god .
i hope you can help me .
i just locked myself out of 4b ,
and i left my purse inside .
so , where &apos;s tober ?
he left earlier .
jury duty , i think .
but he said to ask the super--
hey , you &apos;re ozzie , right ?
yeah . but i &apos;ve never seen you before .
look , i know this is awkward , okay ?
i met calvin last night .
he let me sleep in while he went off .
please .
i &apos;m already so late for work .
in our phase i and phase ii trials ,
we never once found a causal link
between zennapril and brain stem stroke .
dr. winsor ,
is it possible that mr. demory took a wrong
dosage of zennapril for his migraine headache ?
well , he shouldn &apos;t have taken any zennapril at all .
it &apos;s not indicated for headache relief .
zennapril &apos;s not approved for migraines ?
no .
it &apos;s a powerful drug
intended only for patients suffering schizophrenia .
i want to apologize for last night .
i sent that basket before we had our conversation .
no one will ever send you anything again .
thank you .
i , uh ...
i don &apos;t mean to keep doing this .
i need to ask another favor ...
regarding the videotape that you gave me .
okay .
on the tape was a present ... a bracelet .
i need you to look for the receipt .
why ?
i want to use the videotape to try to get peter a new trial .
i think it &apos;s very effective .
but i &apos;m afraid that the prosecution will suggest
that the present wasn &apos;t paid for by peter .
why would they suggest that ?
mrs. florrick , as you know ,
technically , i don &apos;t represent you .
i represent your husband .
and so , as much as i would like to be completely forthcoming ,
in these circumstances , i don &apos;t believe i can .
so kozko gave peter things ,
and you believe peter regifted these things--
this bracelet-- to me ?
i can say this , it would be helpful if we could find the receipt .
alicia ...
if it &apos;s money you &apos;re concerned about ...
what ?
you don &apos;t have to be so proud .
i know you &apos;re carrying a great deal of responsibility right now .
the rent alone ...
well , i just want you to know
that i have more than enough room .
oh ! you know , we &apos;re okay for now .
but thanks .
yeah ?
kalinda ?
hold on
hello ?
hi , it &apos;s alicia . i &apos;m returning your call .
who was that ?
donna .
look , i found out something
about juror number 11 , calvin tober .
i was talking to the super in his building ,
and he let me into his apartment .
why would he let you into his apartment ?
you really want to know ?
no .
here &apos;s the thing , tober &apos;s bank account--
he just deposited $ 20,000 in cash .
i think we have our bribed juror .
yes , it &apos;s ours .
you lost the receipt ?
and i need a copy for my tax records .
it &apos;s a beautiful piece .
one of our finest .
when was it purchased ?
um ... february or march .
maybe january .
i &apos;m sorry , you said &quot; florrick . &quot;
yes .
i found the receipt , but it &apos;s not under florrick .
might it be under a different name ?
i &apos;m not sure .
what name do you have ?
i &apos;m sorry ,
i &apos;m not able to give out that information .
could the name be kozko ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t give out that information .
so , i tracked down tober &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
she says he was five months behind on alimony .
then last week , he paid her ten grand .
he claims he took out a second mortgage on his house .
is that all ?
tober doesn &apos;t own a house .
did you hear me ?
yeah .
kalinda , do you know someone named kozko ?
gerald kozko ?
the real estate developer .
what does he have to do with my husband ?
i don &apos;t know-- does he have anything to do with him ?
you worked at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office for how long ?
two years .
did you ever see anything ?
like what ?
payoffs , gifts-- i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t even know if i want to know .
look , you don &apos;t go to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
to find saints .
i &apos;ll get back to you about tober .
if his payoff &apos;s $ 35,000,
then mccloon owes him another $ 15,000 .
my guess is he gets it before deliberations .
that &apos;s at the end of today .
i better rush then .
objection , your honor !
this is a research document , not promotional material .
overruled .
then let me continue quoting
&quot; primary outcome for zennapril include a 40 % reduction &quot;
&quot; in the average frequencies of migraines . &quot;
we test drugs for all possible outcomes .
it doesn &apos;t mean that we recommend them .
could you please tell the court ...
what this is , doctor ?
objection . we haven &apos;t seen this .
discovery materials , item 469 .
i &apos;ll help you , sir .
this document is an application to the emea ,
seeking approval to market zennapril in europe
as a migraine medication .
am i correct ?
yes .
filed 20 months ago .
dr. winsor ,
would you please tell the court
whose signature is on this application ?
uh , my signature .
no further questions , your honor .
then that concludes the trial testimony .
we &apos;ll finish the day with summations
and jury instructions ,
and then ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
the trial moves into your hands .
and she &apos;s sure it was a payoff ?
no . she saw an envelope exchange hands ,
but she doesn &apos;t know what was inside the envelope .
and she didn &apos;t see the driver ?
no . she saw a dark green suv .
uh , kalinda saw a partial plate-- j15 .
she &apos;s running it now , crossing it with make and model ,
but that could take a while .
start with mccloon &apos;s legal team .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
the jury &apos;s already deliberating .
they &apos;ve sent word to the judge
they may have a verdict by today .
so if we pull the trigger , we do it now .
i &apos;d have to bring the judge everything .
the place mat , the $ 35,000 , the alimony .
you request another juror now , it &apos;d be a definite mistrial .
but i feel like the jury was with me .
i mean , the summation-- they were nodding .
they want to give this to us .
yes , unless juror 11 torpedoes it .
either way , we &apos;re risking a mistrial .
damn . this is roulette .
this isn &apos;t law .
we &apos;re talking about a felony crime here ;
we have an obligation .
the judge wants you in chambers .
this should be interesting .
in the next ten minutes , we &apos;re going to figure something out .
you &apos;re honor , i would like to request a private meeting .
your honor , may i please ... ?
in the meantime , i would like silence .
not mccloon silence ,
not lockhart silence ,
just silence .
unless i point to you ,
you will not speak .
your honor ?
sergeant largon !
sergeant , come in , please .
and wait right there .
anyone who speaks without my permission
will be held in contempt .
now , the jury has reached a verdict .
i &apos;m holding that verdict
until we settle an issue that has arisen .
the foreman has approached me about
being followed by someone from one of your legal teams .
who would that be ?
you may speak .
your honor ,
we have reason to believe
that mr . mccloon bribed one of the jurors .
we intended to bring these charges to your honor ,
but first , we wanted to be certain of our information .
and so you had one of the jurors followed ?
your honor ,
i am stunned .
mr. mccloon , without the outrage , please .
clearly , miss lockhart has nothing solid ,
and she &apos;s trying to torpedo this verdict before it comes in .
she &apos;s worried it won &apos;t go in her favor .
all right , miss lockart ,
i am holding you in contempt .
you owe the legal defense fund $ 80,000
to be paid no later than friday of next week .
and i think i am damn well owed an apology .
i did not point to you .
that &apos;ll be $ 10,000 , mr. mccloon .
now ...
we are all going back into that courtroom ,
and we are all living with this verdict .
if you have evidence of jury tampering ,
miss lockhart , take it up on appeal .
too many people have selflessly invested their time
for your playground tactics to throw this into a mistrial .
now , that &apos;s it .
ladies and gentleman of the jury ,
have you reached a verdict ?
yes , your honor .
and what is your verdict ?
