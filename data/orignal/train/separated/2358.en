Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon,
and vampires are weakened by the sun.
Elijah.
One of the originals.
He's a legend.
Klaus is the real deal.
You're saying that the oldest vampire
in the history of time is coming after me?
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
I need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed.
Then I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
I called Isobel.
Did you find her?
Not exactly.
Hello, Elena.
Uncle John.
Bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
So don't be his friend.
Do you understand me?
I'm Jules.
I know you're a werewolf.
Do you know where Mason is?
He's dead, Tyler.
You want to know who murdered him?
Your little, blond vampire did.
Caroline would never do that.
She and her little vampire friends were behind it.
How's it going?
We need to talk.
Yeah. We do. Listen.
I've been thinking about it,
and I don't want to overanalyze.
It was just one kiss,
but Matt is still kind of in the picture.
We can't go there, Tyler.
Fine.
Great.
That's settled.
What happened to my uncle Mason?
What?
He's dead, and I want you to tell me what happened.
Tyler, I don't--
then let me tell you.
Stefan and his brother Damon killed him
because Stefan and Damon are vampires,
just like you.
Who told you that?
Is it true?
Let me explain.
Did you know he was dead this whole time?
Please--
Did you know?
I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry.
I trusted you.
I--
The sheriff's department believes drugs
played a part in the assailant's deranged and violent behavior
that left 3 people dead at last night's
booster club dinner at a local high school.
The authorities believe last night's assailant
may also be link to the missing campers
and park ranger who have yet to be found
as well as 25-year-old jessica konig,
reported missing this morning.
The sheriff's department says investigations are pending
and no further comment will be made.
In related news, mayor Lockwood spoke earlier today.
Due to the recent tragedies that have plagued our town,
We will be holding a memorial in town square today
to honor all those we have lost.
Join us in hopes that as a community,
we can begin to heal.
Morning.
What are you doing here?
Coffee?
We're not doing that.
We did that last night. No more avoiding.
Why are you here?
Here to protect you.
That's all I can say for the moment.
What do you mean, that's all you can say?
I'll tell you more when I'm convinced I can trust you.
Oh, god, I'm late.
That's what you get for hitting the snooze 3 times.
What the hell?
Hey, good morning to you, Jenna. Alaric.
It's ok I'm confused, right?
Because we were not expecting you, like, ever.
Well, I got in late last night. Elena let me in.
You know, I'm probably just gonna take off.
I'm still confused here.
I decided to come back and stay for a while.
Not here, you're not.
Actually, you can't stop me from living here.
Actually, I can as legal guardian.
Yeah. About that,
Elena, you want me to explain the situation,
Or would you like to do the honors?
Ok. What's going on?
I'm sorry, Jenna.
I should've told you earlier, but--
I'm Elena's biological father.
There. Now you know.
What?
You brought back John Gilbert?
That was your big save-Elena move?
I went to go look for Isobel, and I got John instead.
He said he could help us,
And we're desperate.
We're not that desperate, Stefan.
The guy tried to barbeque me.
Damon, Bonnie's new witch friend is working with Elijah,
so we have to assume that the moonstone was never destroyed.
Elena is putting all of her faith
into some deal that she made
with Elijah to keep everyone safe.
I mean, do you trust Elijah?
I don't trust him. He's an original. He can't be trusted.
It's not like we can just go up and kill him
Because apparently, he can't die.
Still waiting for the part where John Gilbert is the answer.
He knew about the sacrifice.
Isobel told him.
He said he knew of a way to keep Elena safe.
And how do we do that?
He's not talking, at least not to me, anyway.
Great work, Stefan, top notch.
As if I didn't have enough problems.
Hey, I'm sorry about Rose.
Whatever.
I knew the woman for 5 minutes.
And you cared about her after 5 minutes.
Oh, wonder what that means.
It means I care, stefan.
It means I'm changing and evolving into a man
capable of greatness.
You better watch your back
Because I may just have to go get a hero hairdo of my own
And steal your thunder.
I got it, mom.
What's wrong?
Tyler knows about you and damon.
He knows that damon killed mason.
I didn't say a word.
It's that woman jules. She had a run-in with damon.
Tyler was so upset.
The look on his face, he was so betrayed.
Wow, this is bad.
You're not gonna tell damon, are you?
No.We hear that he wants to kill him.
He thinks all werewolves should die,
And he's not wrong to think that, Caroline.
I mean, what if Tyler tries to retaliate?
He has every right to. He can get himself killed.
Well, we're not gonna let that happen.
Yeah. We have to get to him and reason with him
Before he does something stupid.
You have to talk to him.
Just try to explain, you know?
You always know the right things to say, ok?
He and I... We're friends.
I was right, wasn't I?
Your little vampire friend, she was lying.
What do you want?
I want you to understand that a vampire
will never be your friend.
It's our nature to be enemies.
You know how stupid that sounds?
You need to leave here. It's not safe.
I can't just run away with you.
I don't even know you. My mom would freak.
My life is here.
Your old life.
Your new life is just beginning.
You have so much to learn.
Like what?
How to survive.
You've triggered the curse, Tyler.
It's important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope.
We live by a code of loyalty.
We take care of each other.
It's my duty and honor to help you.
Please let me.
Where's John?
He's not here. He left.
I don't know where he went.
He just blew in, announced to Jenna
That he's my dad, and then took off.
It's public knowledge now?
Apparently.
You ok?
Yeah.
Jenna's head is spinning, but I'm ok.
He say what he was doing here?
No. You know, Stefan thinks that he's telling the truth
about wanting to help me.
You believe him?
No. I don't believe him for a second.
I don't, either.
Want are we gonna do?
Kill him.
Damon
I'm joking.
Ok. I'm a little serious.
Damon!
I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena.
I'm the good guy now, remember?
What does that mean?
I'm gonna have a civil conversation with your father.
Wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk.
Then why did you break in?
Would you have let me in otherwise?
Tyler?
Shh. Not a word.
Tyler, I'm leaving for the memorial.
Brady?
This is a hard place to find.
You told me to stay under the radar.
Thanks for coming.
You sure these vamps killed Mason?
Positive.
We have to be careful.
I'm not afraid of a vampire.
I know, baby, but I want the boy
more than I want vengeance.
I say, let's get both.
Maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
What happened to Mason?
Tyler, there's a lot for us to talk about.
I wouldn't do that.
Without a full moon, you're no match for me.
It's good to have you back, John.
We could really use you.
And the council? What are they doing?
Damon salvatore is leading the council now.
Talk to him.
Excuse me.
Jeremy, there you are.
Looks like I slept through the homecoming.
You didn't miss much.
To say that no one is happy to see me would be an understatement.
Things are different now.
You can't come around and
start up with all this antivampire stuff.
I have no intention of doing that.
How's that ring been treating you?
Look. If this is what you came for,
just take it and go.
What kind of man would I be if I took that from you?
Want to go grab some lunch?
Think I'll pass.
All right.
Hello, Bonnie.
I don't have anything to say to you, Dr. Martin,
or your son.
You must be feeling very confused about us.
Nothing confusing about it.
I trusted Luka, and he betrayed me.
Elena told me you're both working for Elijah,
so don't lie about it.
I won't, but that doesn't mean
we're not also looking out for you.
Spare me the witch loyalty crap.
You might not want to believe this,
but Elijah is a man of his word.
You can trust that he'll keep his end of the deal
with Elena to keep you and your friends protected.
You're right. I don't believe it.
Is there a problem here?
Not at all.
What was that about?
More lies.
I can't believe it.
Elena is my sister's husband's brother's daughter,
and her mother is my boyfriend's deceased wife.
You can't make this stuff up.
It's definitely a little overwhelming.
I can't believe that they kept it a secret.
How it is even possible to keep a secret like that?
Hey, you two.
You think I can join you?
Do you have to?
I guess I don't have to, but might as well.
Look who's here.
We just need answers.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Yeah, but stupid is so much more fun.
Damon, I mean it.
All I'm asking is you try to keep it together.
Be the better man.
Ok, then.
John, buddy... How you been?
I've been all right, Damon.
It's good to see you.
Look. About caroline,
no matter what her flaws are,
when push comes to shove,
you're gonna want that girl on your side.
She's your friend. Stop being a dick to her.
I thought vampires hated werewolves.
That's some sort of leftover idea from another time.
Doesn't have to be that way anymore.
We go to the same school. We have the same friends.
We keep the same secrets. This can work, Tyler.
I mean, it's your home. It's my home, too.
I want this to work.
Help. Help.
Whose number was that, hmm?
Damn it, Tyler.
I'm trying to save your life. Can't you see that?
We have a problem.
So, John, rumor has it,
you know a lot and won't say anything.
How do I know you can be trusted, Damon?
Originals can compel vampires,
according to Stefan.
That's why katherine is still in the tomb,
because an original has compelled her to stay there.
Only because all of the vervain had left her system.
Stefan and I, on the other hand,
are chock full.
You guys are drinking vervain?
It's an acquired taste.
I don't see that magical ring on your stitched finger,
so if you know something about klaus,
you better start talking,
Or I will kill you in your sleep.
Now, is that any way to convince me
that you and I are on the same side?
First, I need to know that I can trust you, Damon,
that I can count on you.
Then we'll talk.
I haven't seen you.
I'm not avoiding you, I swear.
Yeah. You're avoiding me a little.
Ok, maybe a little.
Can we talk later?
I mean, I'm headed to work right now, but maybe after,
clear up some of this weirdness?
Yeah. Yeah. I'd really like that.
I'll just swing by when you're closing.
Sounds good.
Ok. Bye.
Excuse me.
Caroline, right?
Yeah.
I'm looking for Tyler.
You haven't seen him, have you?
No, not since earlier.
Sorry.
I know you're lying.
Really? How?
Is that one of your little wolf tricks?
Actually, it is.
Well, I have a trick, too.
I see you got the bullet out.
That was nasty.
I got lots of wooden bullets,
Other toys.
It's gonna be a long night, sweet pea.
You want to be friends, great.
We're friends. Will you go now?
I don't know what else to say to you, Tyler.
I came back to this town because I wanted a life.
I wanted to exist where I could have friends
and where I could build a family.
I have that here. We can both have that.
Hi. Everything ok?
That depends.
How badly do you want to keep her alive?
Who is this?
Ask your brother. Where's Tyler?
Jules?
Where's Caroline?
You made a mistake, Stefan.
I'm gonna give you a chance to fix it.
Where is she?
Right here. Want proof?
He needs proof.
What's happening?
Hurt her again, and you're dead.
I hurt her again, and she's dead.
Bring Tyler to me, clearing by Wickery falls.
You have 20 minutes until she dies.
So my friend wants to meet you.
Damon Salvatore, this is--
I know you-- the news lady.
Yeah, Andie Star. Nice to meet you.
Can I buy you a drink, Damon?
My glass is all full, Andie.
Thank you.
You totally blew her off.
I'm steering clear of all women at the moment.
You didn't have to be rude.
Trust me, it's in the best interest of women everywhere.
Stefan?
What is it?
Why am I just finding out about this now?
Stefan was worried that you--
That I would what, what I would kill him?
Of course. That's what needs to happen.
No, Damon, not Tyler.
Do whatever you need to do to get Caroline back,
But just leave Tyler out of it, ok? - Why?
He's a werewolf. He needs to die.
I'm willing to kill. It's a win-win.
Damon, please, ok? Too many people are dead.
You need to stop doing that.
Doing what?
Assuming that I'll play the good guy
because it's you who's asking.
Be the better man, Damon.
Do you mind?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Doesn't look like nothing.
Well, guess what, John.
Trust works both ways. Get out.
Look. We don't have time for this.
We need to get Caroline back.
We don't need to do anything. I'll take care of it.
First dad duty-- ground your daughter.
Keep her here.
I'm coming with you.
No, no, no, no.
I'm with Damon on this one.
Uh-uh. Nope. Stop, stop. You're not going anywhere.
Just tell me what's going on.
So...
How many vampires are there in this town anyway?
No?
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me? Why?
You're a vampire.
Why not?
I'm sorry. What was that?
Get me out!
Excuse me? What was that?
Let me out!
Get it out of your system?
No. I'm just getting started.
Brady, let's be smart about this.
I just want the boy.
It's our duty to help him. It's who we are.
You want to talk duty and honor?
These are vampires.
They cross one of us, they cross all of us.
That's who we are.
You're not leaving this restaurant.
You can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can. Want to know why?
Because I'm here to make sure you stay safe.
I've got that covered.
Are you talking about the deal that you made with Elijah?
You really think he's gonna keep his promise to you?
Putting your faith in him was a dumb move.
Are you saying I should put my faith in you?
After everything that you did to Stefan and Damon?
We've had our differences,
and I've made mistakes,
but you and I, we're family.
You don't get to use that word.
That word is off limits to you.
Fine, but it doesn't change the facts.
You're right. Facts are facts,
so listen up. You may be my father,
but I am never going to be your daughter.
You got that?
I know you're out there.
Where's Caroline?
Locked up tight.
Let her go and I'll release Tyler.
It doesn't have to get any messier than it already has.
I'm not your enemy, Jules.
It's a little late to be waving a white flag,
don't you think?
You need to leave town.
No one else has to get hurt.
I'm not leaving without Tyler.
Tyler's free to make his own decisions.
As soon as you release Caroline.
My brother the peacemaker.
Since Stefan got here before me,
I'm gonna let him try it his way
Before I resort to my way,
Which is a little bloodier.
So give us Caroline.
Let go of tyler.
Give us Caroline. Light of full moon.
It's not an even fight and you know it.
We'll take you.
I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
Let's try this again.
Give us Tyler.
You heard her. Go.
Which one of you killed Mason?
Uh, that'd be me.
Boys, make sure that one suffers.
We can take them.
I don't know about that.
Well, then...
Tyler! There's a latch.
There's a latch on the door and I can't get to it.
Tyler?
Tyler, please. Tyler?
What's happening?
What the hell's going on?
Elijah made a promise to Elena.
I'm here to see it's upheld.
You need to go.
Get out of here. Now.
When your friends awaken, give them a message.
They need to get the hell out of this town.
So is your mom home?
No. She's at work.
I can come in if you want me to.
I'm fine, stefan.
You don't have to pretend with me.
Anybody would be upset after
what you went through tonight.
I'm OK.
I'm not girlie, little Caroline anymore.
I can handle myself.
You sure can.
I just really want to go shower, so...
Ok.
Ok
Good night.
What do you want?
We didn't finish our conversation.
I'll bite.
I've been thinking. Personal feelings aside, Damon,
I think you and Stefan
Will do all you can to protect Elena.
I agree with that statement.
So I come bearing gifts.
What the hell is that?
This is how you kill an original.
In this vial is ash from a white oak tree
that dates back to the genesis of the originals.
The dagger must be dipped into the ash
And then plunged into their heart.
How do you know all this, John?
Isobel. She's very good at finding out things.
But of course you know that.
Where is Isobel?
Let's just say if she accomplishes what she's attempting,
Klaus will never set foot in mystic falls.
Where Elena's concerned,
You and I are on the same side.
Hey. Did something happen?
Oh, my...I am so sorry, matt.
Are you ok?
Yeah.
Something came up with bonnie
And she needed me.
A friend thing. You understand?
Yeah. So you with her right now?
Yeah. So I'm not gonna make it tonight,
But can I see you tomorrow?
Yeah. Sure. I hope everything works out.
Good night.
Good night.
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
I had no idea they would come for you.
Do you know what they did to me?
I'm sorry. But it's crazy now.
Ok? I don't know who to trust.
You lied to me.
I lied to protect my friends.
I lied to protect you. Don't you get that?
Caroline
You just stood there
When they were going to kill us.
You just stood there. You didn't do anything.
I didn't know what to do.
You help your friend. That's what you do.
I'm sorry. No, it's too late.
Because we're not friends anymore.
And what happened to me tonight,
That will never happen again.
So you take that back to your little werewolf pack
And you get the hell out of my house.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Enough already. I don't want you here
And I can't make that any more clear.
I didn't come here to fight with you, Elena.
Yeah, I know. You're here to protect me.
Got it. Get in line.
I thought you might want this.
It was your mother's.
Isobel?
No.
Your mother. Miranda.
I remember her wearing it when she was young.
I found it in a box with some things that your dad left me.
Here. It's yours now.
Miranda and Grayson were your parents, Elena.
I know I'm nothing to you.
You have no reason to believe me or trust me.
I've done so many horrible things.
But when you lost your parents...
I lost my brother, my family.
I lost my way.
I know I'm probably never
going to make things right with you.
I know that, but...
I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you
And protect this family.
Elena?
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
Did you hear that?
I don't believe him, Stefan.
I just don't.
What happened tonight? How's Caroline?
I could use your help.
Hey. Come on in.
I'm sorry about your friends.
It's not always like this. Is it?
No. Is it, Brady?
No, man.
You're living in vampire country, that's all.
It's way better than this.
Mason didn't tell me anything about it.
He was gone. Dead, I guess,
Before he could help me.
I don't get what Mason was even doing here
In the first place.
His brother died. You know that, Brady
Why was he stupid enough to stay
and get himself killed?
Because of this rock he was trying to find.
What rock?
A moonstone.
I had no idea.
What?
Moonstone? Did he find it?
Yeah. Where is it now?
I couldn't tell you.
What's going on? I was a bit worried about you.
After everything you went through tonight.
I'm fine.
Good. But just in case, I...
brought some backup.
We're gonna slumber it.
We haven't done it in ages.
I love you.
I love you.
I can't believe you called me.
I thought I was being way too forward
When I had Jenna give you my number.
I like a woman who knows what she wants.
Thank you.
So what do you want,
Mr. Tall, dark, and handsome?
I'm not that tall.
I need a distraction.
You can booty call me anytime you want.
See, the thing is, Miss sexy reporter girl,
I have a problem I need help with.
It's really messing with my mind.
Oh. Tell me about it.
I'm in love with a woman I can never have.
I knew it.
I know how to pick them.
So why can't you have her?
She's with another man, I assume?
Yeah, that's not the point.
The point is I'm in love with her
and it's driving me crazy.
I'm not in control.
You don't trust yourself around her?
I don't trust myself around anyone, Andie.
I'm bad, Andie. I do things.
I kill people.
Don't be afraid.
You're ok.
Why do you kill people?
Because I like it.
It's in my nature. It's who I am.
But then I have to stay together to protect her
and she wants me to be the better man,
which means I can't be who I am.
Do you see the problem I'm having, Andie?
Well, maybe this is who you are now.
Love does that, Damon. It changes us.
Just stop talking.
Just kiss me.
Be my distraction.
I know you're expecting someone else.
I sent Stefan to find Isobel.
She got your message. She was busy,
So she sent me instead.
Does stefan know that you're here right now?
No. No one does.
This is between you, me, and Isobel.
I want out of this tomb, John.
