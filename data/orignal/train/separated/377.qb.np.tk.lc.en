こんにちわ 。
american entrepreneur damian hall
was found dead in tokyo
after a night of fine dining with his brother kristopher .
now , the two were visiting tokyo
for some business opportunities ,
and local police ruled it a suicide by hanging .
the japanese call that 首吊り .
why are we traveling all the way across the world for a suicide ?
it &apos;s the third american death by suicide
in tokyo within a week .
the u.s. consulate asked us to take a look .
the first vic , dee brown ,
was engaged to be married when she was found dead
in a japanese school where she taught english .
her knees are tied together .
that &apos;s 自害 , a historic form of female ritual suicide meant
to preserve a woman &apos;s dignity after death .
second vic , bobby freeman , 32,
male , a travel blogger
who threw himself in front of a bullet train .
飛び込み 。
who knew there were so many words for suicide ?
well , the practice of suicide
has been an integral part of the japanese culture ,
from the days of the samurai
to the kamikaze pilots in world war ii .
to the japanese , suicide is considered honorable .
which explains why six japanese citizens
commit suicide in tokyo per day .
and what about americans in tokyo ?
on average , there &apos;s only about five american suicides
per year in all of japan .
so with three suicides in the past week ,
that &apos;s just over 33 times the norm .
and why we &apos;re going .
damian hall &apos;s body was found in a place called aokigahara .
you &apos;re heard of it , clara ?
aokigahara is a park at the base of mount fuji .
its name means &quot; sea of trees , &quot;
but it has another more nefarious name --
suicide forest .
okay , well , that &apos;s not creepy at all .
aokigahara is the most popular destination
for suicides in all of japan ,
averaging more than one suicide per week .
that park &apos;s in tokyo ?
negative , about two hours east .
自杀森林
did damian rent a car , take a cab , train , anything ?
there &apos;s been no credit card or atm activity
ever since he left dinner with his brother .
so how did he end up there ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna find out .
monty , check the victims &apos; background ,
see if there &apos;s any connection between them .
you got it .
since these were all seemingly suicides ,
the japanese consider them open @-@ and @-@ closed cases .
but if this is foul play ,
whoever &apos;s doing it is showing no signs of slowing down .
第一季 第三集
a japanese proverb tells us
&quot; the nail that sticks out gets hammered down . &quot;
our contacts at the tokyo metropolitan police department
are on their way here to greet us .
oh , that &apos;s nice of them .
well , they &apos;re offended we &apos;re here .
oh . okay , so not so nice of them .
well , our very presence here means
that we &apos;re questioning their investigation ,
which the japanese see as disrespectful .
jack , the ambassador has got the japanese government
to grant you special permission to carry a firearm .
and the rest of us ?
that &apos;s a negative .
jack is the rare exception
because of his international reputation and rank .
now , this is considered a high honor
because guns have been outlawed in japan since 1971 .
got your business cards ready , jack ?
what , the badge , jet ,
and weapon clearance isn &apos;t enough ?
in japan , business cards
still play a huge role in professional interactions .
yeah , it &apos;s considered rude to not provide a business card
to a new acquaintance .
we need to build a bridge between local law enforcement
so we can have their blessings
to take a look at these supposed suicides .
so we &apos;re saying hi to mom and dad
before we take their daughter out on a date .
except dad doesn &apos;t have a baseball bat ,
he has a whole police force behind him .
so everyone will follow my lead .
はじめまして 。
はじめまして 。
fbiのjack garrettです 。
警視庁の福井警視です 。
どうぞ宜しく 。
どうぞ宜しくお願いします 。
that was intense .
silence in japan shows credibility .
jack &apos;s using his calm to convey authority .
jack rocks .
chief superintendent kazumi fukui .
agent jack garrett .
your department &apos;s stellar reputation precedes you .
what can we assist the fbi with ?
we believe your findings
on the recent american suicides
have been investigated with proper care ,
but we have american families back home
who have lost loved ones , and they need closure .
so , with your permission ,
we &apos;d like to take a closer look at these cases .
i &apos;m officer ryo mirante .
what makes you think that these suicides are anything but ?
one of our agents spoke to the families of the deceased ,
and all of the victims seem to have had everything to live for .
dee brown was to be married .
bobby freeman &apos;s blog posts were being picked up
by major sites around the world .
and damian hall was young , successful ,
about to close on a house .
and none of them had a history of mental health challenges .
even their latest social media posts
were very positive , no sign of what was to come .
it &apos;s been our experience
when someone had committed themselves to the whispering death ,
they show an uptick in happy behavior .
they believe they have finally found a direction .
even though it is death , it is comforting to them .
your continued expertise in this area is welcome ,
but three american suicides
in a week deserves a closer look .
where would you like to begin , agent garrett ?
have you spoken to damian &apos;s brother , kristopher ?
yes , we took his statement .
kristopher said he had
a business meeting the next morning ,
so he left the restaurant to get some sleep
while his brother stayed behind , drinking .
hotel secretary confirms that kristopher
returned to his room at the time that he stated .
what did the restaurant employees say ?
damian &apos;s death was ruled suicide .
taking statements from any of the other employees was unnecessary .
but kristopher is at his hotel ,
if you would like to speak to him .
we may want to circle back with him later ,
depending on our findings .
of course .
can you escort agent simmons
to where damian &apos;s body was found ?
よかっしました 。
and agent jarvis will need to go to the morgue
to examine his body .
i will accompany her myself .
clara and i will go to the restaurant
where damian was last seen
and question some of the employees .
world famous tsukiji market .
i &apos;ve been to tokyo more times than i can count ,
and i &apos;ve never been down here .
well , it &apos;s been around since 1923 .
this market handles more fish per day
than any other market in the world .
explains the smell .
you know , i know they wear them for health purposes ,
but it &apos;s still hard to get used to .
there &apos;s something on your mind .
sorry .
i -- i should be more focused on the case .
yeah , when we &apos;re working .
right now , all we &apos;re doing is walking .
i guess , i , uh -- i feel like i &apos;m having
a hard time reconnecting since we got home .
why ?
i guess d.c. has changed for me .
now it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s less of a place and more of a time .
a time when i was married .
well , i get that .
my kids are growing up , leaving the house ,
and , suddenly , home feels a lot different .
so what do you do ?
i guess we &apos;ll know when we &apos;re ready .
here we are .
let &apos;s go see what they know about damian .
because of bureaucratic delays
in transporting the bodies back to the u.s. ,
all three victims are still here .
oh , well , seems to be my lucky day .
how is this lucky ?
it &apos;s just a saying .
see , i &apos;m lucky because all three of the bodies are ...
i &apos;m just gonna get to work .
all right , antemortem contusions around the neck ,
along with the hyoid bone being snapped ,
all point towards asphyxia .
you see something ?
yep .
do you see how , at the time of death ,
these bruises weren &apos;t there ,
now they are ?
but how ?
the owners of these cars ...
they went in , but they didn &apos;t come out .
yeah .
&quot; let &apos;s think once more about the life you are given .
your parents , your brothers and sisters and children .
don &apos;t suffer alone .
first , please contact somebody . &quot;
many of the elders believe suicide is respectable
and acceptable .
but my generation doesn &apos;t feel the same way .
we are wary of this niche tourism .
we don &apos;t want our country to be known
as the suicide capital of the world .
some say the forest is haunted by the victims of ubasute .
it &apos;s an old japanese custom
of leading elderly women to a forest
and leaving them to die of starvation or the elements ,
thus becoming vengeful ghosts who prowl the forest .
this is where we found damian .
you have something ?
yeah , wood shavings .
i think this rope &apos;s been moved .
somebody installed this
and had it focused on the crime scene .
it has a transmitter .
this is a network camera with no storage capabilities .
whoever did this was streaming the footage
for viewing somewhere else .
so the question is ...
who &apos;s watching ?
well , the kitchen staff was no help .
what about the servers ?
they said damian left first , not kristopher ,
which contradicts the statement .
why would kristopher lie about who left the restaurant first ?
maybe he &apos;s hiding something .
simmons and mae . yeah , what do you got ?
on the tree where damian was found , i noticed some marks ,
and underneath it , some wood shavings ,
which suggest the rope wasn &apos;t just swinging ,
that it was being pulled .
poor man &apos;s pulley system .
if someone else was involved ,
it might explain how damian got all the way out there .
we also found a camera .
we believe someone may have been filming all this .
already have monty tracking the camera
through the serial number .
let me know what else you find .
mae ?
i found perimortem bruising on the other victims ,
which is called subcutaneous hypostasis
or postmortem staining .
which tells us the vic was physically manipulated
or in some kind of confrontation at the time of death .
bingo .
sorry to crash your party line , jack ,
but tokyo police have discovered another suicide in your vicinity .
american ?
they didn &apos;t say .
せっぷく , better known as 腹切り .
it &apos;s when the victim shoves a knife
into their own stomach , disemboweling himself .
this case has nothing to do with your case .
this victim is japanese , not american .
we have two suicide victims
from the same area within 24 hours .
that cannot be a coincidence .
it &apos;s not .
look at this watch .
it &apos;s on his right wrist .
which means he &apos;s left @-@ handed .
and look at where the hilt of the blade is .
it &apos;s in his right hand .
someone staged this body .
and he froze this way .
he didn &apos;t kill himself .
he was murdered .
jack .
what do we know ?
damian &apos;s body was indeed staged and recorded .
as well as the sushi chef &apos;s .
all previous victims show postmortem bruising ,
which proves that they were physically attacked
just before their deaths .
so someone is using suicide as a cover for murder .
but why ?
perhaps suicide left a significant imprint
on our unsub at an impressionable age .
but unlike the american victims , the sushi chef is japanese .
so what &apos;s the pattern ?
it &apos;s not clear yet ,
but now that we know that this is a murder investigation ,
i want to talk to damian &apos;s brother asap .
i &apos;m sorry to say , but the conclusion
to your investigation was incorrect .
perhaps we should look deeper into this .
good .
then we &apos;re ready to deliver our initial profile .
three of the four vics were found in a local school ,
sushi restaurant , and subway .
which tells us our unsub is familiar with the region .
a tokyo resident .
yeah , statistically speaking ,
he is probably of japanese descent .
based on his ability to reposition
and overpower his victims , he &apos;s most likely a male ,
six foot tall , 140 to 160 pounds .
but the average japanese male is only about 5 &apos; 7 . &quot;
so he &apos;s a big man on campus .
that might be part of the problem .
in japan , you don &apos;t want to stand out ,
or you can be ostracized .
based on the ages of our vics ,
we believe he &apos;s between 25 and 35 .
and he &apos;s also streaming his kills remotely ,
which means he &apos;s technically sophisticated .
then why film it ?
to admire his work .
yeah , his propensity towards voyeurism
and the nature of these blitz attacks tells us
that he probably is incapable of normal social interaction ,
and he may be unemployed .
what of the suicides ? why fake them ?
well , it &apos;s either a forensic countermeasure ,
which has been working , or it &apos;s a ritual .
the staging of the bodies must mean something .
the unsub could be seeking to purify his victims
by giving them honorable deaths .
there &apos;s no shame in the act of suicide in japan .
but there is shame in the act of murder .
monty , anything on the cell phone and camera we found ?
they were both bought at a kuru tech vending machine with cash .
any common thread between our vics ?
sorry , jack , right now , i &apos;m striking out .
but i &apos;ll keep swinging .
good .
simmons , mae , go grab damian &apos;s brother , kristopher .
i want to have a little chat with him .
clara and i will head to the police station ,
interview the sushi chef &apos;s wife ,
see what her husband &apos;s story is .
mrs. nakano , i &apos;m jack garrett with the fbi .
this is agent clara seger .
mind if we sit down ?
mrs. nakano , was your husband a sushi chef his whole life ?
yes . he took great pride in his work .
but it came with a price .
he had little time to be father and husband .
ごめんなさい 。
why did your husband leave daichan &apos;s after 30 years ?
he realized daichan was never going to retire ,
and if he did , he would most likely
leave the business to his son .
did this cause any bad blood
between your husband and his employer ?
he never spoke of such things to me .
once he left daichan , he cut all ties with him .
do you know of anyone who would have wanted to hurt your husband ?
i &apos;m not sure .
my husband carried a great shame .
it followed him all his life ,
but maybe it finally caught up with him .
whatever it is , you can tell us .
it &apos;s important that you do , it can help others .
excuse me .
what is it ?
his great shame was that he was different .
this feels like a dead end , jack .
well , maybe not .
mrs. nakano didn &apos;t know if there was any bad blood
between her husband and daichan ,
so let &apos;s go right to the source .
what &apos;s up , jack ?
monty , i need you to look into chef daichan &apos;s sushi restaurant .
i need to talk to the owner .
the restaurant closed a month ago
and there was no forwarding address .
track them down , asap .
hey . so i checked kris &apos; room ,
the gym , bar area -- no sign of him .
yeah , hotel surveillance shows that he left 10 hours ago ,
and he hasn &apos;t returned .
hey , monty -- just the man i &apos;m looking for .
i bet you say that to all the boys .
so it seems that kris has flown the coop .
can you get eyes on him ?
or see if he skipped town .
his passport hasn &apos;t been scanned anywhere ,
so he &apos;s still in the country .
no activity on his credit cards .
but he did use his atm card 15 minutes ago
at a liquor store not too far away .
all right . let &apos;s roll .
to my big brother ...
we have stuff to do tomorrow , do not to late .
okay , mom .
what the hell , man ?
hey , hey . kristopher hall ? fbi .
we need to speak to you about your brother .
my brother &apos;s freakin &apos; dead .
hey , jack . yeah , we got damian &apos;s brother ,
but he &apos;s got his wobbly boots on .
okay . you got it , see you soon .
okay , jack said take him back to the hotel
and pump him with some coffee .
he will meet us as soon as he can .
come on .
just waiting on the paperwork
to go through so i can take my brother home ,
or i &apos;d be out of this place already .
what brings you to tokyo ?
food , business , fun .
this was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime .
what kind of business ?
damian and i have a hedge fund company
that &apos;s done fairly well in the last few years .
we recently put some money into an american investment group
that &apos;s redeveloping land in tokyo .
taylor investments .
that &apos;s right .
so what else aren &apos;t you telling us ?
i &apos;m telling you everything .
like that your brother left the restaurant first , not you .
our reputation is important to our business .
i didn &apos;t want it out there that damian left the restaurant
first in the pursuit of some ...
professionals .
so can you describe these professionals ?
dark , tan skin , sunglasses .
they were japanese ,
but they had long , blonde , surfer girl hair .
well , blonde , tanned , sunglasses in japan
should make it easier to find .
i &apos;ll see what ryo and i can dig up .
excuse us .
thoughts ?
well , he &apos;s using the present verb tense when speaking .
people who are guilty tend to use the past tense .
he &apos;s also provided details in his story ,
even at his own expense .
so , why don &apos;t you go take a hot shower , get some rest .
we might need to speak to you again .
so be available .
i &apos;m all ears , monty .
okay , daichan and his wife , reiko , recently lost
their business when the building they leased their restaurant
in for the last three generations was sold .
and then , jack , they committed suicide .
jack ? jack , you okay ? what was that ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , monty .
but kris hall was just murdered .
the room is empty . unsub &apos;s gone .
we found an unconscious security guard near the back fire exit .
must have been how he got out of here so quickly .
jack .
i think he &apos;s using kris &apos; computer to record all this .
turn it around .
the unsub is not admiring his work ,
he &apos;s enjoying the aftermath .
you rang ?
monty , the camera that simmons found
in the suicide forest was off ,
but that &apos;s because the police had already been there .
the unsub already got his fix .
but the camera in the freezer was still on ,
just like that one is now .
meaning the unsub is watching us through kris &apos; laptop .
see if you can find where this feed is leading to .
give me a second to hack into
the hotel &apos;s internet connection .
your agent is hacking into a japanese hotel
secured internet connection .
this is not protocol .
i &apos;m trying to catch a killer .
there &apos;s no time for protocols .
okay , so the unsub is bouncing the video
off of a torrent @-@ distributed relay service .
no central server , no log files .
i cannot trace how many times
the video &apos;s been accessed or by whom .
i &apos;m not going to be able to get an i.d. here , jack .
mae , did you learn anything about the girls
that damian was with before he died .
they &apos;re from an escort service that specializes in gyaru .
it &apos;s a japanese girly glam style .
they use tanning beds , wigs ,
and sunglasses to look like california girls .
we reached out to the service ,
and we talked to the girls , and --
their alibis checked out .
yes .
damian approached them
and he didn &apos;t want to pay that much ,
and the girls went on to find another job .
how did you know that , jack ?
monty , is the company
that bought chef daichan &apos;s taylor investments ?
that &apos;s affirmative .
the restaurant is our common thread .
jack , the common thread is not just chef daichan &apos;s ,
but where it sits .
the tsukiji market .
taylor investment &apos;s business plan
was to redevelop tsukiji market .
daichan and his wife lost the sushi bar ,
committed suicide just prior to the first american being killed .
but dee brown is not connected to the market .
see , she died a week after daichan
and his wife committed suicide .
now , because she was found in her school ,
no one noticed that all three victims
live in the same building .
now , according to dee &apos;s checking account ,
she had been making monthly deposits to daichan ,
who owned her apartment and subleased it to her .
but there &apos;s a note here saying that
the payments were to stop this month .
yeah , she was getting married , moving on .
you know , the sushi chef &apos;s wife said that her husband
left daichan &apos;s when he realized daichan
was gonna leave the business to his son .
strange that the sushi chef held out so long ,
knowing that is customary .
unless he thought there was some reason daichan &apos;s son
could not fulfill that commitment .
the police report said that the son , yukio ,
first heard the shot ,
found his parents dead , then called it in .
okay , yukio has no records and no i.d.
except for a birth certificate going back 33 years .
he &apos;s practically a ghost .
yukio is the only person
at the center of this who &apos;s still alive .
the death of his parents could have been the trigger .
he blames all the victims for his parents &apos; suicide .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s using suicidal methods to kill .
the blogger badmouthed the market ,
thus hurting daichan &apos;s business .
and the sushi chef left daichan &apos;s to go to a competitor .
dee brown was moving , leaving daichan without a renter .
and taylor investments put them out of business ,
making damian and his brother the nail in the coffin .
we &apos;ve got our unsub .
monty , we need yukio &apos;s family &apos;s home address .
clear .
password locked .
monty , we &apos;re in the unsub &apos;s apartment .
can you hack into his computer ?
okay , i need you to look on the back of the router for me .
i &apos;ve got it .
great , now read me the esn .
it should be nine hexadecimal characters starting with --
2 @-@ 1 @-@ alpha @-@ 3 @-@ 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ echo @-@ 1 .
how fast can you do this ?
sorry it took me so long .
i need you to find me anything
that points to who the next vic might be .
jack . the slot in the door ,
dirty dishes , all this take @-@ out ,
it reminds me of something i read about on the way over .
引き笼もり .
yes .
hikikomori is a sociological phenomenon here in japan .
it &apos;s when young people retreat into their rooms .
they cut off all social ties
and spend their time watching tv or surfing the internet .
yeah , some of them spend up to 30 years
in their self @-@ inflicted seclusion .
what causes it ?
my people have a keen sense of shame
if you do not live up to social pressures .
well , the pressure to take over the family business
could have made yukio retreat back to his bedroom .
that might explain why the sushi chef thought
the son could never take over the restaurant .
so our unsub hears gunshots .
he &apos;s forced to leave his bedroom after many years ,
and then he finds his parents
have committed suicide in the living room .
i think you may be correct , simmons .
yukio has pictures of his parents &apos; dead bodies on his computer .
how could they shoot themselves if guns are banned ?
if you owned the gun prior to 1971,
‭ you were allowed to keep them .
looks like an old nambu pistol from world war ii --
probably belonged to daichan &apos;s father .
so yukio is most likely armed .
i found yukio &apos;s hit list ,
and there &apos;s two extra names on it -- sean kagame ,
who is a japanese @-@ american businessman ,
and jarod taylor , the owners of taylor investments .
one of them is yukio &apos;s target .
we need to find him before he does .
whoa , guys , i have an external device
trying to contact the computer .
he &apos;s recording again .
means he &apos;s about to strike .
hey , what happened ?
so yukio knows we &apos;re in his home
and shut us down , but not before i got his location .
he &apos;s in a nightclub in shibuya crossing .
i &apos;m sending the address now .
let &apos;s go .
lock this place down -- nobody leaves !
he &apos;s alive .
yukio is here , watching .
he knows we were in his home ,
he can &apos;t go back there .
to savor this moment , he &apos;s got to stay here , in it .
which means we &apos;re looking for the one person
who is not filming .
jack , if he &apos;s been in his room for years ,
chances are he has a vitamin d deficiency .
look for rashes and rickets .
he &apos;s also taller than the average japanese person ,
so he &apos;s gonna stick out in a crowd .
he will be alone , his body language
will be stiff and distant
- he &apos;s not used to these crowds .
yukio @-@ kun .
they did not care for me .
they were ashamed .
i was weak .
i failed them .
but now they have their revenge .
you think that makes what you did okay ?
i gave them each an honorable death .
which is more than they deserved .
my parents will finally be proud of me .
there &apos;s no honor in what you did --
for them or for you .
you &apos;re wrong !
what do you know about me ?
what do you know about us ? !
yukio , listen to me .
you can have honor .
turn yourself in right now , right here .
i &apos;m not done yet !
you okay ?
thank you for your assistance and your understanding .
we are much more flexible than the world believes .
so how much trouble are you in with the boss lady
for talking out of turn ?
whatever it is , it was worth it .
please accept this as a token of our appreciation .
only if you let me send you
some american whiskey in return .
twist my arm .
so , any updates on our burn victim ?
yeah , we were able to get to sean in time .
he &apos;s gonna have a long road ahead of him ,
but he &apos;s gonna be all right .
and his business partner , jarod ,
was found safe in their hotel room .
you &apos;re not gonna lock yourself
in a room for 30 years , are you ?
no , our job sort of prevents that .
can i say something ?
can i stop you ?
i admire you , clara .
you &apos;re so giving , so warm ,
so smart that sometimes i want to punch you .
but the longer that you isolate yourself ,
the harder it &apos;s gonna be to come back to the real world .
so let &apos;s just rip off the band @-@ aid and go for it .
okay .
really ?
but just you and i -- no guys .
i am not quite ready for that excitement yet .
yeah , okay , cool . i &apos;m good with baby steps .
good .
let &apos;s go home .
