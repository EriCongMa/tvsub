how &apos;d we do ?
you tell me .
no hard feelings , okay ?
daniel , sometimes i feel that you could be ,
uh , a little overly sensitive .
okay , uh , why , uh ... why is it that you feel that way ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess it &apos;s the way you are .
i mean , you &apos;ll take the most benign comment ,
and @-@ and you &apos;ll take it as a personal insult .
it &apos;s extremely annoying .
positive language , commander .
okay . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
um , when you do that , it is ...
the opposite of pleasing to me .
is that okay ?
okay , i think that the reason that you , uh ,
think that i am so sensitive is because i &apos;m an actual person .
i mean , i have feelings .
i &apos;m not an animal , i &apos;m not a killing machine robot .
active listening , detective williams .
don &apos;t deflect .
this is stupid . i &apos;m sorry ,
but can we move on ? i don &apos;t ...
gentlemen , when i conducted your psychological audit
back in september ,
you agreed to check in with me and share your progress .
frankly , i &apos;m not seeing any .
which leaves me to wonder whether you should be
coming here more regularly .
wait a second .
i didn &apos;t mean to give you that impression ,
because things have actually been great ,
right ?
yeah , it &apos;s true .
um , we &apos;ve been getting along a lot better .
more communicating .
right .
fighting a lot less .
really ?
yeah .
mm , and how do you account for this sudden breakthrough ?
account ... okay . well , i would say , if i &apos;m being honest ,
that i think steve is doing a really , really , really good job
with his control issues .
he &apos;s working on it , and he &apos;s doing good .
wow . and who &apos;s the sensitive one now ? you see ?
what did i say ? did i say anything ? i didn &apos;t say anything .
no , no , no , you didn &apos;t say ... no , you didn &apos;t say anything ,
&apos;cause that would require using words ,
uh , you know , to articulate a thought .
why would ... why would you say anything ?
why speak english when you can just
blow air out of your nose mouth. and tilt your head to ...
out of my mouth .
it was your nose . i know it .
i saw it . it was your nose .
ooh , commander , i take it you disagree
with detective williams &apos; assessment ?
okay , actually , you know what ?
here &apos;s the real reason we &apos;re getting along so great ,
is &apos; cause i don &apos;t listen to him anymore .
uh , can we get back to the control issue thing ?
actually , we &apos;ll have to get that next time .
the hour is up .
oh , wait , hold on .
what next ... what next time ? what next time ?
i &apos;d like to see you again , and ...
me , us , or what ?
and i &apos;m giving you both something to take with you .
what is it ?
that , gentlemen , is your homework .
since you saw fit to waste
almost the entire hour attacking each other ,
you &apos;re going to do a little conflict counseling
on your own time ,
and i expect that completed by our next session .
hey , lou , what &apos;s with the big turnout ?
security guard was one of ours .
mike velasco .
he made his pension last year .
took a part @-@ time job
so he could spend more time with his grandkids .
we &apos;re doing a door @-@ to @-@ door right now to see if anybody
saw the perp fleeing .
all right . what about witnesses inside the store ?
no . all they saw was a guy in a mask with a big gun .
he was in and out , got what he wanted , psh .
the whole thing couldn &apos;t have lasted more than a couple minutes .
he shot mike before he could press the silent alarm .
move ! i said , move !
and then he made me empty the safe .
what was in the safe ?
about three million dollars worth of loose diamonds .
they were just delivered last week .
so who else knew about that delivery ?
just my staff and our supplier .
all right , ms. price , we &apos;re gonna need a list
of everybody who works for you , of course ,
and whatever security footage you have , please .
of course . i &apos;ll get that for you right away .
thank you .
all right , so our thief didn &apos;t just do his homework .
somebody tipped him off about that diamond delivery , right ?
kono , what do you got ?
witnesses described a late @-@ model chevy impala
speeding away around the time of the robbery .
canvass turned up tire treads
consistent with the make and model .
all right , tucked @-@ away alley ,
just a block or two away from the crime scene .
this has got to be the getaway car , right ?
yeah , and there &apos;s something else .
it &apos;s a whole lot of blood .
it &apos;s on the passenger side ,
so i &apos;m thinking our thief may have been shot
by his own wheelman .
that &apos;s a smart move .
let the guy with the gun do all the work
while you wait in the car . he comes back , you pop him ,
and you double your money .
low risk , big reward , except for one thing .
where the hell &apos;s the body ?
well , there &apos;s a blood trail
leading away from the scene .
hpd &apos;s still canvassing , but looks like he got away .
codis just matched our blood sample
to a guy named jacob anders .
he &apos;s in the system for aggravated assault and one burglary charge .
we need to check emergency rooms
and look into anders &apos; known associates ,
anybody he might reach out to
now that he &apos;s wounded and on the run .
hey , check it out .
traffic cam just caught a black impala running a red light
three blocks away from our crime scene .
now , facial rec
i.d.s the driver as emma mills .
the court documents indicate she &apos;s this guy &apos;s girlfriend .
it &apos;s a hell of a way to break up with somebody .
kill him and cut him out of a score . it &apos;s pretty cold @-@ blooded .
well , no honor among thieves .
anyway , gps on emma &apos;s phone shows her to be
at her apartment right now .
you know , she must think anders is dead .
it &apos;s the only reason she &apos;d feel safe just sitting at home .
well , hpd dispatch is sending the closest unit available
to pick her ass up .
whoa , no , no . call them off .
what ?
call them off .
all right ? anders is the priority .
he &apos;s a cop killer .
the best way to get to that guy is keeping this girl in play .
anders is gonna patch himself up ,
and then he &apos;s gonna come after emma .
when he does , we &apos;re gonna be waiting for him .
that &apos;s her .
oh , it &apos;s perfect .
thank you . we &apos;ll take it . excellent .
this is crazy . you cannot do this .
agnes is coming back this week .
you &apos;re not supposed to do this .
how can you move into somebody &apos;s apartment ?
i &apos;ll tell you how we do it .
okay , see this is a court order ,
says we can do anything we want .
anybody asks , i &apos;m agnes &apos;s nephew ,
and we &apos;re just house @-@ sitting , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine . i promise . no problem .
thank you so much .
she want everything just right !
you don &apos;t touch nothing !
it &apos;s gonna be fine , no problem , but okay .
thank you .
no touch !
mahalo .
nothing , all right ?
all right . smells in here .
it &apos;s like , uh , loneliness and despair .
that &apos;s mothballs .
hopefully , anders will , uh , show up soon ,
and we can call it a day , huh ?
guess who &apos;s the queen of qvc .
i get it . i got a match .
mr. pickles .
what are you ... ?
what is the matter with you ?
what &apos;s the matter with me ?
thing jumped out of nowhere . i got scared . what do you want ?
what i want you to do-- maybe react like a grown man .
how about that ? it &apos;s a cat .
okay , let me explain something to you that you do not know .
i don &apos;t like ... i don &apos;t like cats .
i love cats .
of course you love cats .
yeah , i love cats .
who doesn &apos;t love cats ? they &apos;re awesome .
they &apos;re like adorable little ninjas .
they &apos;re smart , and they &apos;re fast ,
and they &apos;re , uh , cute and cuddly at the same time .
help me with this .
okay , just so you know , cats are disloyal , all right ?
they would eat their owners if they could .
that &apos;s right . they &apos;d turn on them and kill them .
yeah , they would . you want to know why ?
&apos;cause they never lost their predatory instinct .
put it up here . let &apos;s get the couch , too .
for instance , a dog . you take a dog .
take , like , a domesticated canine ,
you put it in the wild .
24 hours , that thing &apos;s dead .
okay , but a cat-- they never forgot how to hunt and kill .
well , i guess that &apos;s why you two get along then .
that &apos;s why you like cats .
yeah . that &apos;s funny . that &apos;s good .
we got a situation here .
what do we got ?
i mean , this ...
what do we do ? i mean , i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s the protocol ? do we watch , do we not watch ?
i mean , it &apos;s our job .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here for . we got to watch .
i don &apos;t ... it &apos;s not like ...
no , don &apos;t do that .
lost visual .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s still in the shower .
well , we got time to kill .
you , uh , maybe do a little bit of homework , huh ?
you smashed this cat to pieces ,
you know that , right ?
i understand . oh .
i think i liked her better as a brunette .
looks like she &apos;s ready to split town .
i &apos;ll give you five to one the diamonds are in that book .
oh , yeah . what did i say ?
nobody under 30 &apos;s got books anymore .
that &apos;s a big stone .
hello ?
he &apos;s dead .
wait , wait , wait , wait . slow down .
what @-@ what the hell happened ?
there were cops .
they shot jake .
i just ... i don &apos;t know what to do .
she &apos;s a good liar .
just relax , sweetheart .
did the cops see you ?
no .
i was able to get away with the diamonds .
good .
then this doesn &apos;t change our arrangement .
i &apos;ll be there in a couple of hours .
just lay low until then .
okay . hurry , please .
wait a minute .
what ?
i heard that voice before .
money , money , money , money
hi , i &apos;m barry burns
president and ceo of gold blast usa ,
and i want to help you turn your old and unwanted jewelry into ...
cold hard cash .
guaranteed same voice , for sure .
where did you even see this ?
it was on an infomercial .
i have insomnia . one of the benefits , you see .
silver , rings , bracelets and chains .
we even buy ... diamonds !
he &apos;s got to be the fence , this guy .
if he shows up here , we &apos;re gonna have to arrest them both ,
and then there goes our bait .
well , we got to make sure burns doesn &apos;t make it .
so , mr. burns ,
hpd just pulled you over with $ 2 million cash in your car .
care to explain ?
uh , sorry , since when is , uh , being rich a crime ?
it isn &apos;t . but conspiracy to commit a robbery is .
and when a retired cop is killed in the course of that robbery ,
then you become an accessory to murder .
we &apos;re up on emma mills .
we know about the deal you had in place
to fence those diamonds with her and anders .
gentlemen , i @-@ i think this is the point in the conversation
where i ask to call my lawyer .
actually , this is the point
in the conversation where you should listen .
and listen carefully because we &apos;re about to do you a very big favor .
emma lied to you .
anders was not killed by the police . she shot him .
and he &apos;s still alive .
look at your face .
what happened to all these smart comments ?
just dried right up , huh ?
she actually tried to ice her own boyfriend
just to cut him out of the score .
we &apos;re guessing she &apos;ll roll over
pretty easily on her fence .
so , um , i gather the takeaway is you &apos;re offering me a chance
to screw emma over before she screws me .
she &apos;s expecting you to show up with the cash any minute , right ?
yeah .
all we &apos;re asking you to do
is call her and reschedule .
deal .
you know , she should &apos;ve known she was playing with fire .
i mean , guys like ivanovich ,
they don &apos;t die easily .
wait a minute .
who the hell is ivanovich ?
trust me , somebody you don &apos;t want to mess with .
our thief &apos;s real name is radomir ivanovich .
he &apos;s former serbian special forces .
after the bosnian war , he repurposed his skills
to become a high @-@ end jewel thief .
pulled robberies all across europe ,
dropping lots of bodies along the way .
now , a couple years back ,
he surfaces in hawaii under the name jacob anders .
now , he hooked up with emma mills
on a bunch of smash @-@ and @-@ grabs until emma finally got pinched .
she never rolled on the guy though ,
so she ended up serving ten months in prison .
wait a minute . she does ten months
for the guy and then she gets out and shoots him ?
how &apos;s that make sense ?
don &apos;t know yet .
but i &apos;m gonna keep looking .
all right .
roger that . keep us posted , chin .
copy .
this , uh ...
this blond got a lot of heart , huh ?
that cereal looks good , doesn &apos;t it ?
what ? i &apos;m doing her a favor . the food &apos;s gonna go bad .
what the hell is the matter with you ? who does ...
what are you , an animal ?
okay ? i know you &apos;re lazy .
you don &apos;t want to get up . but i don &apos;t need
your disgusting bagel plate in my work space .
that must be exhausting ,
projecting that much contempt onto a ...
onto a piece of porcelain .
ceramic , putz .
hey , mr. pickles .
want something to eat , buddy ?
hey , danny .
look at this .
that &apos;s a lot of weed .
yes . oh .
aloha , neighbor .
hi . h @-@ hi .
you must be agnes &apos;s nephew .
i heard you were house @-@ sitting .
no , that &apos;s me .
uh , news travels fast around here .
i &apos;m ruth tennenbaum from 2d .
i made you a batch of my signature
macadamia nut cookies .
that &apos;s nice .
oh , i see you boys ...
like to snoop , too .
ruth , hi . uh , ms. tennenbaum .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
this is my partner , danny williams .
i see .
we &apos;re trying to keep a low profile .
so if you could keep this to yourself , it &apos;d be nice .
we don &apos;t want anybody else in the building to find out .
oh , i understand .
some of the alta cockers in our building are so small @-@ minded .
just so you know , i fully support ...
gay marriage .
we &apos;re , uh ...
we &apos;re not gay .
we &apos;re five @-@ 0 , ma &apos;am .
we &apos;re , uh ... we &apos;re actually working undercover here .
that &apos;s why we can &apos;t , uh , let anybody else
find out about it , you see ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s very important .
ms. tennenbaum , can you ... you can keep a secret , right ?
of course . to tell you the truth , i @-@ i feel much safer
knowing you boys are here .
good . that &apos;s good .
there &apos;s been a lot of crime in this building .
just the other day ,
a plant was stolen from right outside my front door .
while you &apos;re here ,
maybe you can catch the hoodlum who did it .
yeah , uh , we &apos;d love to help , but we &apos;re ...
you know , we &apos;re kind of tied up .
oh , i understand .
you &apos;re busy with important police work .
i &apos;m just an old lady with a stolen fern .
oh , did i mention that it &apos;s a fern ?
six years i had it .
i don &apos;t mean to bother .
you know what ,
um , i &apos;m gonna send somebody over to look into that .
okay ?
such a sweet boy .
okay ? so you go home , and , uh ...
and you &apos;ll expect to see somebody soon .
all right ?
be sure
to return the plate when you &apos;re finished with it .
okay .
thank you very much for the cookies .
thanks . oh . sweet kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty .
thank you . yes . he @-@ he is .
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s good .
okay . bye @-@ bye .
bye now .
bye @-@ bye .
bye now .
bye .
i personally would &apos;ve gone with the , um ...
the gay thing to keep our cover .

you choose . any place you want . what do you want ?
uh , chinese sounds good .
i get a headache from the msg .
okay . uh ... how &apos; bout , uh ...
how &apos; bout that pizza place that doesn &apos;t suck ?
oh , i got it . i got it , i got it , i got it .
you ever had indian food ?

we got a little chicken there . get your chicken .
put it inside , make a little meat pocket ,
however you want to do it .
then you go mango chutney .
mango chutney .
put it on top .
go .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s how you do it .
what &apos;s the matter ? you don &apos;t like it .
no , i like it very much .
it &apos;s probably one of best things
i &apos;ve ever tasted in my entire life .
in fact , i don &apos;t know how it is
that i &apos;ve gone this long in my life
without experiencing such exotic flavors .
all right , so what &apos;s the problem ?
the problem ?
what &apos;s with your face ?
well , the problem might be
&apos;cause you said i could choose where we eat .
what ?
&quot; you choose . &quot; you said , &quot; you choose . &quot;
you said , &quot; you pick . &quot; and i picked a bunch of places ,
you knocked them all down , and then you picked a place
that you wanted ... oh , i &apos;m glad you think it &apos;s funny .
are you kidding me ?
no .
it &apos;s dinner , danny .
what are you talking about ?
well , no , that &apos;s the thing . it &apos;s not just dinner , okay ?
this is what &apos;s called relationship dominance .
okay ? it &apos;s like you having to drive my car .
you always got to drive my car .
you got to be in control , steve .
you get that from your workbook ?
i did get it from my workbook , okay ?
it &apos;s a very enlightening chapter , okay ?
it &apos;s all about personality types .
oh , you &apos;re gonna read it to me ?
tell me this doesn &apos;t sound like you , okay ?
&quot; estj , or guardian types ,
&quot; are confident , dependable , loyal .
&quot; natural leaders .
&quot; tend to put forth much effort
in fulfilling their duties and obligations . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , can i stop you for a second ?
am i supposed to be offended ?
&apos;cause you just made me sound awesome .
well , those are the strengths . now i &apos;ll get to the weaknesses .
&quot; not naturally in tune with what others are feeling .
&quot; difficulty expressing emotions .
difficulty accepting criticism . &quot;
hey , can i eat my meal ?
sound familiar ?
yeah , you should .
can i eat my food in peace , all right ?
it &apos;s fine . the ... look . look . simple . layman &apos;s terms ,
you are a whacked @-@ out control freak , okay ?
yeah ? but i love you , and i really thank you a lot
for introducing me to this saag paneer
or whatever it &apos;s called .
you &apos;re welcome .
agnes .
agnes isn &apos;t due back till next week .
i &apos;m sorry . i must have the wrong place .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not possible ,
considering you just let yourself in with a key .
right .
so what &apos;s up , fellas ?
uh , i &apos;m house @-@ sitting for my aunt agnes . who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m ricky . from downstairs . yeah .
agnes has me check in on mr. pickles
while she &apos;s out of town .
guy needs lots of play and stimulation
or he gets a little moody , you know ?
cats are , like , highly intelligent .
he &apos;s a dog guy .
oh . lame sauce , bro .
cats are where it &apos;s ats .
come here , little feller .
can you stop making that noise , please ?
please ?
all right .
i &apos;m gonna feed my main menehune here ,
and then i &apos;ll let you dudes get back to your chow .
let &apos;s see .
where did agnes leave that cat food ?
you looking for this ?
oh , no . that &apos;s the , uh , catnip , bro .
so i don &apos;t know how i feel about this .
you &apos;re storing dope at my , uh ... my aunt &apos;s place ?
it &apos;s pretty genius , right ?
that way , the cops can never put me in the same room
as the icky sticky .
ergo , icky ricky never gets caught with the sticky .
you dudes want to smoke a bowl real quick ?
family style ?
uh , i &apos;m good .
he @-@ he gets ... crazy paranoid .
oh , hey , man , if green ain &apos;t your scene ,
i can hook you up with something else .
coke . x. pills .
anything you want .
i got a connect .
even have a guy that can get you snakes and ferrets .
they &apos;re banned in hawaii , you know ?
because they &apos;re invasive species .
yeah . we know that .
yeah , man , you dudes know what &apos;s what . here .
let me give you my card .
&quot; ricky schiff . travel agent . &quot;
you want to go on a &quot; trip , &quot; i &apos;m the guy to call .
ah , yes .
that &apos;s good .
nice . we &apos;ll call you .
we will definitely call you .
cool . thanks , man .
you guys enjoy .
be good , mr. pickles !
have fun !
later , skaters .
the guy who sells the weed is in 2f .
what ?
a @-@ actually , i &apos;m here about the fern .
commander mcgarrett sent me .
you tell him i don &apos;t want a new fern .
i want the one that was stolen from me .
oh , no , this isn &apos;t a replacement .
this is bait .
you see ...
we &apos;re gonna set this little guy
outside your door to lure the thief back .
only , this time , we &apos;ll be watching .
aren &apos;t you a clever boy .
come in .
could you describe the pteridophyte ?
who ?
the fern .
it wasn &apos;t adiantum , was it ?
commonly known as a maidenhair fern .
see , those require regular watering ,
which would mean we &apos;d be racing
against a ticking clock to get it back safely .
it &apos;s just a regular fern .
dijon or ... or yellow mustard ?
dijon , i guess .
but , uh , like i said , i already ate .
back to the crime in question .
do you have any enemies in the building ?
someone who might have taken the fern out of revenge
or maybe for leverage ?
well , there &apos;s eileen chow--
don &apos;t get me started on her .
but we can talk about all that later .
right now i want to talk about you .
is there a lady in your life ,
maybe somebody you have your eye on ?
no , not at the moment .
well , get on that , bubeleh ,
&apos;cause life isn &apos;t worth the price of admission
if you don &apos;t have someone to enjoy it with .
and from the looks of these pictures ,
you seem to have done a lot of living yourself .
oh . i have .
i slowed down since my husband morris passed away .
i don &apos;t get out much these days .
eat .
cut in triangles .
my mom does that .
the good ones do .
aw , that smells disgusting , steve .
who microwaves an omelet ? huh ?
the body needs protein .
when you &apos;re not sleeping , it needs it even more .
what is that ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m doing a little , uh , quiz out of this book :
uh , how well you know your partner .
it asked me to list something
you were very passionate about .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;d you write ?
protein .
excuse me ?
protein .
protein ?
well , you really , uh , really peered into my soul .
okay , what are you passionate about ?
well ... there &apos;s things i &apos;m passionate about .
like what ?
music . i &apos;m passionate about music .
that &apos;s a terrible cop @-@ out .
i mean , everybody &apos;s passionate about music .
i like music , too .
i mean , bon jovi , i could tell you every song he ever wrote .
big deal .
oh , no .
i &apos;m not passionate about listening to music ,
i &apos;m passionate about playing music .
oh , you play music ?
that &apos;s funny , just &apos; cause i &apos;ve known you for a very long time
and never seen you even close to an instrument ,
let alone playing one .
well , i used to play guitar .
actually , i was really into it .
i was quite good , too .
but you stopped . why &apos;d you stop ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
i just stopped , didn &apos;t i ?
oh , my god .
get in there .
hey , man .
the two of you haven &apos;t even been here more than a day .
how the hell does it smell this bad already ?
because this animal is microwaving eggs .
he ...
oh , man , that &apos;s just reckless .
y &apos;all need to get some febreze crackin &apos; up in here , man .
what &apos;s the matter with him ?
you have a cat in here !
yeah , here .
oh , i &apos;m highly allergic .
fine . sit down . sit .
come here .
this is a true story .
i lost my virginity on a couch like this .
now , you &apos;d think the plastic would be a problem .
it &apos;s not .
okay , dopey , listen to me .
you got a meeting in 15 minutes with emma ,
and you &apos;re gonna make that meeting , you understand ?
but you &apos;re gonna tell her you need another 24 hours
to get the money together .
guys , no , i @-@ i already stalled her once .
if i don &apos;t give her the money ,
she &apos;s gonna shoot me in the face .
okay , it &apos;s a risk we &apos;re willing to take .
either you &apos;re playing me ,
or you &apos;re a really terrible fence .
which one is it , barry ?
sweetheart , relax , i &apos;ll have the money by tomorrow .
every cent , i swear .
you better , barry ,
or i &apos;m gonna hunt you down and put a bullet in you .
now , get the hell out .
all right , all right ,
i &apos;ll get it .
all right , lou , he &apos;s coming down .
10 @-@ 4 . we &apos;ll pick him up .
looks like she &apos;s making a call .
you get it ?
no . son of a bitch says he needs one more day .
what if he &apos;s stalling ?
what if he knows i lied about what happened ?
relax . if he suspected anything ,
he wouldn &apos;t have even shown .
just reschedule your flight for tomorrow ,
and i &apos;ll see you in a couple weeks .
no , i can &apos;t wait that long .
please .
okay . i &apos;ll see you tonight .
so , what happened ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
that &apos;s the @-@ the broad from the jewelry shop .
that &apos;s mia price .
okay , so this was an inside job .
she helped them rob her own store .
i didn &apos;t ask you over to talk about barry .
looks like she &apos;s getting more than just a piece of the action , huh ?
i took another look at the security footage ,
and check this out .
right before the robbery ,
price glances at her watch .
and then take a look at what else she does .
she calls the guard over
so he won &apos;t be by the silent alarm .
and she doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s an ex @-@ cop ,
that &apos;s he &apos;s not gonna lay down
if his job is to protect the place .
now , financials show that the business had been struggling for years ,
but just two weeks ago , price maxed out her credit
on a huge order with her diamond supplier .
just in time for the robbery .
all right , so ...
price helps these guys pull this thing off for a cut .
she also gets her insurance money .
nobody knows nothing .
everybody wins .
except somewhere along the way ,
emma decides to hook up with price and
cut ivanovich out of the equation , right ?
it &apos;s a bold move ,
taking out a serbian badass .
i &apos;m guessing that price had no idea who she was double @-@ crossing .
hello there .
how can i help you exercise
your second amendment rights this evening ?
正常营业
本店已打烊
i fell asleep .
i miss anything ?
apparently not .
they stopped for a water break about half an hour ago .
that &apos;s good . you got to stay hydrated .
very important .
see this ? this is bad for us men in general .
this is what gives us a bad name .
20 , 30 minutes-- that includes a drink .
that &apos;s three hours-- make us look terrible .
this is impossible .
we can &apos;t do this .
you , uh ...
you reading the workbook ?
no .
no ? it was over here ,
now it &apos;s over there ;
you had to do something with it .
when you fell asleep ,
you dropped it on the floor .
i moved it for you over here .
you didn &apos;t look at it ?
i look at it ?
maybe ... yeah , i looked at it a little bit .
i skimmed through it a little bit ; i was bored .
what &apos;d you think ?
that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re unbelievable .
i mean , i @-@ i have seen you personally put yourself
in every conceivable life @-@ threatening situation
without batting an eye , like it &apos;s nothing .
but when it comes to talking about your feelings ,
forget about it , you &apos;d rather chew cyanide .
forget it .
wake me up if they stop or do something interesting , or ..
open up their curtains .
you want to know why i don &apos;t play guitar anymore ?
yes , i would like to know
why you don &apos;t play guitar anymore .
tenth grade talent show .
i signed up to perform .
i practiced the song every day for months and months ,
and the day finally came around .
i was standing in the wings .
my guitar was in tune .
they called my name , i walked out on stage .
i turn around and look at all those people .
and i couldn &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t do it , so i walked off
and never played guitar ever again .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
tenth grade , you had stage fright ,
so you never played guitar ever again ?
i didn &apos;t have stage fright ; it was bigger than that .
i &apos;m telling you , man , it was a , uh ...
you know , i guess it was an existential crisis .
i just , in that moment , i couldn &apos;t handle
the @-@ the vulnerability that i was experiencing .
i couldn &apos;t handle how exposed i felt .
i felt like i couldn &apos;t breathe ,
and i thought it was gonna kill me .
look , man , i was raised differently than you , okay ?
i wasn &apos;t raised in a house
with a supportive family
encouraging me to share my feelings .
and in your case , every feeling .
the mcgarrett men are a different breed . they ...
to them , showing emotion is like
showing weakness , you know ?
i mean , it &apos;s stupid , but it &apos;s just the way it is .
mm , i understand that , um ...
i just figure after
everything we &apos;ve been through , you know--
your father , my brother , everything--
i figured maybe i was , you know ,
somebody that you could open up to , is all , you know ?
i just did .
where &apos;s the cat ?
you left the window open ?
oof . i swear i didn &apos;t leave it open on purpose .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s him .
if i had just gotten to my piece fast enough ,
you guys would be taking him out of here in a bag .
okay , norm , do you , uh ... do you know what he stole ?
guns , ammo ?
he took a lot more than just guns .
it sounds like ivanovich is gearing up for a war .
according to norm ,
he stole small and large arms , body armor ,
explosives-- the works .
sounds like an awful lot of
firepower to go after one girl .
looks like price is on the move .
okay , i &apos;ll keep eyes on her
and put a detail on the store .
see you guys later .
i &apos;ll get it .
you &apos;ll get it ? were you expecting someone ?
what up , playboy ?
what the hell is this ?
cat &apos;s sense of smell is 14 times stronger than a human &apos;s .
and that sweet scent of agnes is gonna
bring mr. pickles back home .
stay frosty .
you called the drug dealer
to find mr. pickles ?
and why did i have to do that , danny ?
no , no , no . don &apos;t do this , okay ?
it &apos;s not my fault , it &apos;s your fault .
how is this my fault mr. pickles got out ?
you &apos;re the reason ; you left the window open .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have had to leave the window open
if you hadn &apos;t decided it was a good idea
to make a microwave omelet .
you know what , this whole passive @-@ aggressive thing ?
i &apos;m done . i &apos;m tired . it &apos;s tired .
all right , let &apos;s do aggressive @-@ aggressive .
how do you want to do it , guy ?
&apos;cause i could ...
it &apos;s not our girl .
i got it .
two floors down . apartment on the end .
not good . we got to do something .
we just got played .
danny .
clear .
pulse is fading .
this is detective williams .
i got a shooting victim at 2119 kuhio avenue , 503 .
expedite ems .
stay with us .
diamonds are gone .
she &apos;s dead .
stop , right there .
you thought you could steal from me ?
got a feeling i know where he &apos;s going next .
mia price , you &apos;re under arrest .
hands behind your back .
wait , what ? what &apos;s going on ?
you have the right to remain si ...
how big is your safe ?
you double @-@ crossed me .
where was i ?
that &apos;s right .
you have the right to remain silent .
thanks , duke .
hey , what are you guys doing here ?
well , uh , we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re cops .
that &apos;s really bad .
for me , i mean .
well , it &apos;s not good for you .
despite incriminating yourself in half a dozen felonies ,
you found mr. pickles and you brought him back ,
so for that we &apos;re gonna give you a pass .
thank you .
but you got to give all the names of your suppliers to lukela here .
sell my boys out ?
no way .
not gonna happen , bruddah .
i &apos;m no snitch .
this should be obvious ,
but if you don &apos;t cooperate , you go to jail .
who &apos;s got a pen ? there are a lot of names .
i &apos;m really sorry , but ...
i &apos;m afraid this mystery may go unsolved .
oh , well , that &apos;s okay , bubeleh .
what &apos;s important is that you tried .
you know , ruth ,
i know it &apos;s easy to focus on the things we &apos;re missing .
but it &apos;s really important to appreciate what &apos;s around us .
because when you actually get out there ,
you know , and take a look ...
it can be really beautiful .
you &apos;re right .
thank you .
tell you the truth ,
i don &apos;t even think there was a fern .
i just think she wanted someone to talk to .
you know what , whatever you did , it worked .
she seems happy . good job , jerry . well done .
so she asks her husband ,
&quot; what does mrs. goldberg have that i don &apos;t ? &quot;
and the old man looks at her and he says ,
&quot; parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
jerry , your friend here has a filthy sense of humor .
and we fully approve , by the way .
this is some good @-@ looking treif .
let &apos;s start you off with a piece of resistance .
my garlic shrimp .
