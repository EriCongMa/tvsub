第七季 第十六集
What is this, again?
Roar.
Is it real?
Oh, yeah.
But the lion bit her.
Yeah, there was, like, 70 injuries
during the making of this.
No!
That's Melanie Griffith right there.
She had to get 50 stitches.
This is insane. It's like a... a snuff film.
You are weird.
Whose is that?
Mine.
So why were you investigating me?
Was I investigating you?
24 hours of honesty.
I didn't know what I was getting into.
And what were you getting into?
I don't know.
You were a new boss, you just stole an election.
I didn't steal.
I wanted to make sure you paid me.
Really-- you thought I wouldn't pay you?
Hey, I been screwed over by a lot of people.
Like who?
Who screwed you over?
Oh, people I used to work with.
What people?
I'm not trying to interrogate you.
I'm just trying to have a conversation.
I talk, you talk.
Well, my best friend screwed me over
and borrowed a bunch of money, never paid me back.
I thought you were gonna say a lover.
No. Only money.
Never been screwed over in love.
Oh, you feel sorry for me now.
Nice robe.
Thanks.
So what's up with your husband?
My husband? What do you mean?
He wouldn't look askance at me being here with you,
eating pizza in our underwear?
Well, he might.
But we have an arrangement.
Really? How's that work?
He needs me for his career.
I need him for mine.
What, that doesn't meet with your approval?
I can read the non-verbal Jason signs now.
One eyebrow up:
"Do you really mean that?"
One eyebrow up with a smile:
"That sounds a little ridiculous, doesn't it?"
Use your words, big man.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Okay, let's just hide.
They'll go away.
Alicia, I know you're in there.
We need to talk.
What?
That's my mother.
Okay...
Stay right here.
Don't move. I mean that.
Alicia, open the door.
I'm crying here.
Are you home?
Will you answer me?
What's wrong, Mom?
I'm distraught. What are...
Were you sleeping? It's 3:00 the afternoon.
I know.
I'm tired.
It's Sunday.
That's the day I catch up on sleep.
So let's talk later.
No, this is for now. What do you mean, later?
Oh, I called your brother. He's coming over too.
What? Mom, no.
No, this is about both of your futures.
I'm gonna be dead one day, Alicia. Dead.
Now, would you please open this door...
What the hell is going on?
Are you hiding something?
No.
I'm just sleeping.
Well, this'll just take a minute.
Okay, so call me.
I did call you. You weren't answering the phone.
I was Madoffed.
What's that chair there?
I'm painting.
What, really?
Doesn't smell like it.
Then where were you sleeping?
Grace's room.
Where's Grace?
With Peter. Uh, college for the weekend.
Mom, let's talk tonight.
Oh, I was robbed, Alicia.
I met this financial advisor.
He was a young guy. Uh, he reminded me of Ricky--
you know, the Dartmouth guy you used to date?
And he told me he could double my money.
Oh, God.
Yeah, that's right, blame me.
I'm the victim, so go ahead, blame me.
Okay, Mom, I will talk to someone at work.
Is the money all gone?
Yes, every cent.
Wait, Mom...
Oh, come on, I just want to see the color of the...
Ooh. Mom, wait.
This must be the painter.
Can we do this another time now, Mom?
I will talk to David Lee tomorrow and he'll get into it.
Hi, I'm Veronica.
Jason.
Oh, Jason.
I don't think I know a Jason, do I?
Mom. Please.
I'm an investigator at Alicia's work.
Really?
What's your last name?
Okay, we're not having this conversation...
Crouse.
Crouse-- what kind of name...
Is that German?
English.
Uh, but a bit of a mix, though.
My Mom is Italian.
Oh, God, the Italians.
The color of Italian skin.
Okay. Okay, you-- stop talking.
And you, Mom...
Oh, that must be Owen.
Owen, we're in here.
Oh, dear God.
I brought bagels.
Where is everybody?
Owen, I know this is important, but it's my day off.
Can we do this tomorrow?
Hey, I'm just going where Mom told me.
Stay.
That's it. Okay, Mom, let's let Jason alone for a few minutes.
Up...
Oh. Let's talk in the kitchen.
Only if Jason promises to come join us in the kitchen.
Oh, I promise.
Alicia has taken a lover.
I haven't taken...
What? Who is he?
Jason.
An investigator. He's amazing.
Good looking?
Ooh, oh, my God.
Finally she has someone she deserves.
Mom. Stop.
I want to see.
Let me see.
No, seriously,
both of you, stop. This is my life.
It is not a reality show.
It's okay, he's getting dressed.
But he's coming out.
What?
Of the room,
He's coming out of the room.
God, you have a one-track mind.
Could you please both go in the kitchen?
Go. Go, go, go.
Stop.
So... how'd you meet him?
At work. He's the investigator.
Oh, my God, that is so sultry,
that is so essence of New Orleans.
Okay, Mom, so what happened with your scam?
Oh, I don't want to talk about it.
That's the only reason we're here.
Well, until about four minutes ago.- How much did you lose?
I don't know. About $100,000.
What? You said $30,000.
Well, look, I didn't ask him to lose it.
He was going to invest it. And then I get...
this letter.
Gino Davidson?
Yeah, yeah, what's...
I mean, what's wrong with that?
You know, it's very racist of you to think
there's something wrong with that name.
I thought David Lee was investing for you.
Did he connect you with this guy?
No, not really.
Didn't I say?
Yeah, but I didn't know how much to believe you.
You know, he can hear you, right?
Jason, this is my family.
My mother, Veronica, and my brother, Owen.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I should get going.
No! No!
Have a bagel. We're hav-- we're having bagels.
It is Sunday, right?
Yes. Lot people want to see you, Alicia.
You're popular.
Well, Jason has a very busy Sunday...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He's not leaving without a bagel, are you? Come on.
Sure.
Go get your door, we'll be fine.
We tried calling.
It's Sunday.
I know.
This is Mike Tascioni.
And this is Tom.
Do you have a little water?
Who is it?
It's not Peter, is it?
That would be awkward.
What is your mother doing here?
Nice apartment.
Thanks.
Eli, can we do this--
whatever this is-- another time?
I wish we could.
Mike is Peter's new lawyer,
and the grand jury starts tomorrow.
We think you'll be called.
Did you get a subpoena?
No.
Well, you will.
But we need to ask a favor.
We want the grand jurors to see you there
as they enter and leave.
It'll make a difference if they see your support.
It'll humanize Peter.
Who did your interior design?
The colors are really good.
Tascioni? Are you...
Elsbeth's ex-husband.
Yes.
Well, come on in.
We have bagels.
Really?
Tom loves bagels.
It's all about the orgasm.
Naomi Wolf called it the goddess array.
Thanks...
Mom.
You all right?
I'm great.
Oh, hey... Jason.
Eli.
Here we are again.
So why isn't anybody at church?
What do you mean?
It's Sunday.
We're all here.
And not at church.
That's a good point.
I go to church Sunday nights.
Really?
Yeah.
Greek Orthodox. Why?
Well, I would imagine that would come as a surprise
to my daughter.
My money's on Peter.
Not funny.
Okay. I'll get that.
Alicia Florrick?
Would you believe no?
You've been served.
Come on in!
We've got bagels!
Okay!
Eli Gold. How are you?
Good. Do I know you?
You don't. Connor Fox. I'm from L.A.
I'm prosecuting your client.
My client? Governor Florrick?
So you're admitting you are prosecuting him.
Well, I'm here in a grand jury room
with 16 upstanding citizens thinking about it.
Maybe you'd like to tell me what you're thinking
of prosecuting him for.
What would be the fun in that?
It's our only element of surprise, isn't it?
You have to figure out, of all the dozens of cookie jars
Governor Florrick has his hand in, which one we've caught.
Hello.
Hello. Mike Tascioni.
And you're...
Peter Florrick's lawyer.
Well, that's an...
interesting way to go.
Nice dog.
Thank you. His name is Tom.
Oh. Hello, Tom. Hey, buddy.
Is he a service dog?
Yes.
Good to know.
So, what are we doing here?
Lawyering by loitering?
Yes.
Really?
Yes, since you won't tell us why you're targeting the governor,
we're going to question the witnesses as they leave.
They won't talk to you.
Then we'll time the duration of each witness' questioning
to determine which witnesses
you're bringing as smoke screens and...
which go to the heart of the case.
Mike, Mike, I don't think it's a good idea to...
And why won't I just stretch out the amount of time
I question the smoke screens?
Because you can't.
Try stretching out ten minutes' worth of questions to one hour.
Seems doable.
Yes, if you don't mind
angering your grand jury by wasting their time.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Hello.
I didn't think your subpoena was for today.
It isn't.
We wanted your jurors to see her out here supporting her husband.
Well, that is a strategy.
Oh, and here they come.
Thanks. Come on in, guys.
You sure you don't mind being here all day, Mrs. Florrick,
to support your husband?
No, not at all.
It's not gonna make a difference.
Hello? David, yes.
Is my mother there?
Hi, Alicia. I'm here.
We've already discussed that Veronica made a mistake
going out on her own with this investment.
Yes, I've been properly spanked.
And I'm asking our investigator
to step in to look into this investor's scam.
Ooh, the investigator.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Hey, Mom?
Did David just step out?
Yes, he did.
Owen's here.
Owen? Why is Owen there?
Uh, because I'm supposedly good at math.
Yes, everyone blames me.
I guess I need a minder now.
Moi.
Okay, look, guys, I don't want my
workmates to know about my personal life,
so can we not mention Jason at my house?
Alicia, please, I'm not a dummy.
We already discussed it. Oh, here-here he is now.
Ah. This must be our investigator.
Hey, Jason. Hi.
Alicia just, uh, told us your name, Jason.
Wasn't that right, Alicia?
Yes.
Hello.
You've been the victim of a pyramid scheme?
Is that Alicia?
Yes.
We should talk to her now.
Alicia, do you mind?
Uh, we have to talk to you a minute about firm business.
Okay.
What are you doing? Your office.
No, your office.
Diane will see us in my office.
Yes. And that's what we want.
Alicia, we're worried Diane is making a power play for the firm.
Yes, I've heard about your concern, Cary,
but I think it's just paranoia.
Diane hasn't reached out to you to join her?
Join her in what?
In an all-female partnership.
Look, you're the one who brought me into the firm, Cary.
I'm a nonequity partner. I don't mean anything.
It's not about your position.
It's about your connections and your last name.
We think that Diane might try to use you
as a lure to female-leaning clients.
Are you hearing this from Diane?
No. We're hearing it from clients.
And you're not denying it.
Then I'm denying it.
Diane hasn't approached me.
She's lying.
Then what do we do?
Put her on the hot seat.
Tell her if Diane approaches her, she has to talk to us.
Still there?
Okay, but she hasn't approached me.
Okay, guys, uh, I have to go. But, yes,
I'll let you know if Diane approaches me.
Eli.
Don't tell me you made a deal.
Alicia, hello.
Ruth. You made a deal.
Eli, this isn't the place.
Oh, yes, this is the place.
This is exactly the place.
Do you know what this does to my resume?
I'm being subpoenaed. The last thing I need
is to be testifying against a client.
Which is what you're doing?
I'm answering questions, Eli.
Same as you. Same as anyone.
Hi. Mike Tascioni.
And this is Tom.
Hello.
She made a deal.
I didn't make a deal.
We're ready for you, Ms. Eastman.
You testify against Peter, no one will ever hire you again
and you know it.
How can she hurt us?
In ways I can't even imagine.
Who is it?
I'm looking for Gino Davidson.
Hey. I'm Gino.
Should I know what this is about?
Does the name Veronica Loy ring a bell?
Oh, geez...
I like Veronica.
She always sat in the front row of my class.
What class?
Fire Cycle. I teach Monday, Wednesdays,
and some Fridays to pay the rent,
while I day-trade and study up for my Series 7.
So you day-traded away Veronica's $100,000?
No. Is that what she told you?
No. She told me you promised to double her money.
No way, man. I did the opposite of promise her.
I told her it was a high risk investment.
What was?
I have a cousin that got in early
on riverboat casinos, made a killing.
So when he told me he was gonna do a second round,
I put a little of my own money in.
Risk capital. Part of a...
smart asset allocation.
I mentioned it to Veronica. She said she wanted in.
But that didn't pan out?
Let's just say I'm not gonna
be hanging up my bike shorts anytime soon.
I was very clear with Veronica about what she was getting into.
Look, I'm telling you the truth.
Hey. I'm sorry you got saddled with all of this.
Uh, it's all right. But this guy seems to be telling the truth.
He's an idiot but not necessarily a con man.
So you're asking if my mother is dumb enough
to give $100,000 to an idiot?
Not dumb enough. Just whether...
Yes, well, she is.
All right, well,
I-I don't really think there's an issue here then.
It's not a Madoff situation.
It's just a bad investment.
Okay. I'll talk to my mom.
No, don't worry about it. You know what,
I got to tell David Lee, so I'll talk to her.
How are you doing, by the way?
Good.
Wait, which subject?
Our lost weekend.
Good.
I needed to clear my head.
And we didn't even drink.
We didn't.
Sex is a good replacement for tequila.
It can be.
I wish you were here right now.
Where's here?
Handicapped bathroom in the federal building.
You know, I think I wrote a Penthouse letter
about something like that.
Okay. I'd better go. Take care.
An example of what you mean by that.
They're not clean and pure.
No one is suggesting Governor Florrick is pure.
I did my due diligence
before joining. That wasn't surprising.
Perhaps not to you.
A grand jury might be surprised to learn
some of these things about Governor Florrick.
What things about Governor Florrick?
Let's turn to the events of November. You were...
I...
Eli, can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Do you mind?
I'm a lawyer. And Mike is a lawyer.
I can't get too involved in... this.
Wh-What is this?
Uh... Alicia...
Alicia, this is...
Shut up.
I think bringing me in
implies something very smart about...
Is this the grand jury?
I can't say anything.
I'm a lawyer, and I've been subpoenaed.
But I am hearing the grand jury room?
You found this on your own.
It's not illegal for you to listen.
It is illegal for me.
Oh, my God, you're great.
Good-bye.
Eli Gold, bless his heart...
... now is the time to put it in the...
No, no, can't.
All right, so put it over there, huh?
Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.
How many of these things do we got to do...?
We got to fix that...
...might have acquired a quick infusion of cash.
He did.
And did Lloyd Garber provide that money?
He bundled it for us, yes.
And you had struggles with Eli Gold, too, didn't you?
Eli Gold had some issues with me
because I replaced him as campaign manager.
Well, let's talk about Eli Gold for a second.
Candidates don't come into your life like newborn babies.
They're not clean and pure. Certainly not Peter Florrick.
My question was
whether you ever heard him agree to a quid pro quo.
Every candidate gets asked favors.
Comes with the territory.
But I never saw or heard Governor Florrick cross a line.
Good Lord.
Thank you, Ms. Eastman.
Let's turn to the question of donuts.
Okay. Which one?
Lloyd Garber.
He was one of Governor Florrick's top donors, yes?
Yes, that is true.
In fact, wasn't Lloyd Garber the single largest donor
to Governor Florrick's presidential campaign?
Yes, he donated money, organized fund-raisers.
And they had conversations you weren't privy to?
Of course. Donors on that level get a lot of access.
Did Governor Florrick ever mention a falling out or
a period of friction?
With Mr. Garber? No.
Did Mr. Garber mention it?
No.
Just to be clear,
he never mentioned any trouble in 2012?
I never heard of any.
He didn't mention Peter
prosecuting his illegitimate...
That would be no. I don't know anything about that.
Uh-huh. But you would expect that situation
to drive a wedge between Mr. Garber and Governor Florrick.
He wasn't Governor Florrick at that time.
Yes, of course. State's Attorney Florrick.
You would expect support to be cut off...
but it wasn't.
In fact, Mr. Garber started bundling even larger amounts.
It's occupied! Try the next one!
Damn it!
Okay, I have something to tell you,
and I can't tell you how I know it.
Why?
I just can't. Mike!
Why?
You're both lawyers, I'm not, but it is my understanding
that what they're discussing in that room
is an event that took place in 2012.
That's very specific.
What event in 2012?
I'm not sure, but I know
it has to do with Lloyd Garber.
So we think this is about corrupt fund-raising practices?
Yes.
Is there anything there?
I don't know.
I know what I did. I... don't know what Peter did.
Mrs. Florrick?
I don't know. You'd have to talk to Peter.
And we have no hint as to what this event is in 2012?
Well, maybe you can go and find out more, Eli.
Oh, right. Uh, yes.
Think there's something here that I don't want to know about?
I think you might be right.
Is it illegal or unethical?
I... don't know anymore.
Mrs. Florrick.
Oh, Mister... Is it still Hlavin?
Sure. Just to keep things easy.
Mr. Hlavin.
And are we admitting we're an FBI agent today?
Why not?
Mr. Tascioni,
this is Roland Hlavin. He's an FBI agent
who keeps things interesting.
Nice to meet you.
I guess you're the next witness.
I think I am.
And do you know what this is all about?
I think it's a grand jury investigation.
And it's focusing on 2012?
What?
2012. That's what this is about, right?
What are you talking about?
The events in 2012 with Lloyd Garber.
It was completely innocent.
Who told you this has anything to do with 2012?
Where'd you hear that? Did Connor say something?
He did.
And you should tell him that we're prepared to show
that this is a witch hunt?
Even the payoff?
Yes, even the payoff.
Okay, great. Bring your worst.
Nice to meet you.
Nicely done.
Is there a payoff?
I have no idea.
You'll need to refute it in your testimony.
What is Eli doing?
We have to get an investigator on this.
That would be good. Do you have someone in mind?
Unfortunately, you weren't cheated, Veronica.
Says him.
Yes, but also, those papers that you signed.
But if I was cheated, those papers shouldn't count.
You weren't cheated, Mom.
I was.
I mean, they make the print so small,
and they trick you with the language.
And I mean, who reads all that?
You invested in a riverboat casino?
He said that the only person who comes out ahead in gambling
is the house.
You don't believe me, do you?
But he cheated me.
This is just like that last time, Mom.
That guy who got you to give him your Social Security number?
He said you were in trouble.
I couldn't get a hold of you.
So the money's gone?
Well, pretty much. You still have some investment money.
Not enough to pay off Mom's mortgage?
We'll see.
I did nothing wrong here.
I was cheated.
This other guy that got her Social Security number--
When was that?
Last year.
We worked it out. He never got any money.
Do you remember the month?
Why?
I need to check out something.
Is it something that will get her money back?
I don't know.
February? Around my birthday.
Hey.
Hi. I was just coming to talk to you.
Where you going?
To find your mother.
Okay, not what I expected.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Would you be offended if I said I want to take you right now?
No.
So, anyway,
um, are you still freelance?
I am. What do you need?
It's not for me.
I hope this isn't too weird for you.
It's for your husband.
How did you know?
That look on your face.
Well, we think this grand jury investigation is about something
that happened in 2012 involving Lloyd Garber.
That's all we know.
Can you find out more?
I can try.
And this is okay with you?
It's just work.
Hey, and what's going on with my mom?
I thought that was over.
It was.
But I just found out she's on the sucker's list.
It's a list of people that have fallen for scams.
Con men trade and sell them.
So, she was cheated?
It's possible,
but the con man covered his tracks,
so, we have to create new ones.
Here, let me help you.
Oh, God.
Okay, I'd like to turn...
Strike that.
Was there a task force in place
to investigate Governor Florrick?
No. This began as an investigation into corruption
in the Cook County judiciary.
Well, without compromising your other investigation,
tell us what turned your attention to Governor Florrick.
Well, it started as a chance comment by an informant.
And what was that?
We were working undercover at the time
when a judge we had turned told us about a case...
Hey, what are they doing with the drywall here?
What'd you say?
What are they doing with the drywall here?
I don't know. They haven't said anything about it.
What do we do? Just leave it?
I would.
They always get pissed if we think for ourselves.
I know, but check this out.
And in this context, what does certain mean?
Well, you can't just go on the testimony of
one guy you've already rolled up.
What about this? Huh? What about this?
Hey, hold on a second!
Hold on a second!
Oh, come on. Come on!
Wait. What?
I'm not sure if this is the right wall.
Are we on the right wall here?
V-Lock.
He's gonna take another ten hours...
Are you certain that was a result of corruption?
Governor Florrick committed a crime then?
Yes. It's extremely unlikely it was a coincidence.
That's not how politics works,
not how Chicago works.
No, no. This is the right wall.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
It's about V-Lock.
V...?
Lock. This investigation is about V-Lock.
What's V-Lock?
I have no idea.
Sorry, I wish I could help, but just don't know how.
Give my mom her money back.
I lost $80,000 myself.
It was everything that I saved.
You lost her $100,000.
It wasn't even hers to invest.
Owen, he already told me.
Mom, I don't care what he told you...
It was a risky investment.
I told her.
Owen, I told you.
This isn't going to work.
We'll just invest it somewhere else.
All right, fine, we'll call him.
Wait, invest what somewhere else?
Oh. Oh, that's all right.
It's just that we need a more certain investment.
I have more certain investments.
Veronica, I told you, this was one of the riskiest,
with the highest yield.
Yeah, but since she lost half her savings,
she needs a higher yield.
Wait, so how much do you have to invest?
My husband's pension.
$90,000.
But we need a certain investment.
I have some options.
Listen...
How'd it go?
I think I was pretty damn convincing.
My husband's pension.
I've got to invest it.
He bit?
Hard.
Hello?
Hey, Alicia.
Oh, tell her what we did.
Actually, we have another issue.
We think this grand jury investigation
might have something to do with V-Lock.
V-what? What is that?
V-Lock. We don't know what it is.
How was it used?
I don't know. Just the issue is V-Lock.
What about State of Illinois v. Lock.
That sounds interesting.
We need to look into if there is a People v. Lock.
All right, I'm on it.
Aren't you going to tell her what we did?
We kicked ass, Alicia.
I'm so glad.
I-I have to go.
Do you have a minute, Alicia?
Sure.
Uh, it's been a bit of a ride, hasn't it?
I know we've had some tense moments, but...
I'm very glad you're back home.
I am, too.
Good.
Things are finally settling down.
Cary thinks you want to take over the firm
with female partners.
Is that true?
No.
A year ago you asked me,
why not make it an all-female firm?
I know.
But you've changed your mind?
I have become, uh,
more temperate.
But what is it that you want?
I want to be of use.
No, you don't, Alicia.
I've watched you over the years.
You hide your ambition under a bushel,
but it is a very bright lamp.
I was very happy on my own.
I'm very happy here.
You may be suspicious of me,
but all I want is to be of use.
I'm not suspicious of you.
I want to join forces with you.
Uh, could you give us a minute?
I've been working with Cary now as a fellow name-partner
for a year.
He's learned a lot, I respect him a great deal,
but he is no Will Gardner.
He doesn't pretend to be.
You don't either, but you fill his shoes.
You can slice an opponent to shreds,
smiling the whole time,
and they come back, thanking you.
I want someone I can work across from who...
who I can respect, who I think can outrace me.
Cary is not that person.
And anyone who's not that person is holding us back.
So you're a woman,
I'm a woman.
What are you proposing?
I'm proposing that we work together, that's all.
To push Cary out?
To buy him out... eventually.
This is not about a take over.
This is a way to sharpen our advantage.
There will be a winnowing among law firms in Chicago.
It's happening already.
We need to make ourselves even more relevant.
You and I can do that.
What do you say?
Shall we eat?
I need a word.
Yes.
Who was Richard Locke?
The People v. Locke.
You were the prosecutor.
I was on the team, but I rode the bench.
Matan was lead. Why?
Was it a murder trial?
Yeah. The kid, Richard Locke,
was accused of murdering his girlfriend's ex.
He claimed it was an accident.
Was it?
Unclear. The case ended in a mistrial. Why?
Was there anything unusual about the case?
Well, the defendant, Locke, was young, working class,
but he had an amazing defense team.
Who paid for that?
We didn't do a source of funds,
but there was a rumor that his father
was someone who mattered.
Are you going to tell me what this is about?
Is there any chance his father was...?
No, we have to stop talking.
You'll be subpoenaed about what I just asked,
and I will be about what you said,
so I am ending this.
Oh, hey, I'm heading out. What's up?
Sorry, I gotta rush off.
I'd love to talk.
How about later tonight?
Now. Now's good.
Why, what do you need?
So how would this deal work?
If Mom pays you the $90,000, how is it more secure?
Because it's government guaranteed.
That's like Uncle Sam insuring your cash.
And we can still get a 14% yield?
That's the beauty of it.
Really?
The beauty of it.
That's illegal-- Illinois is a two party state.
You can't use that in a court of law.
I don't plan on using it in a court of law.
Then how do you plan on using it?
That depends on where Veronica's money is.
I don't understand.
Is it always like this here?
Pretty much.
Diane thinks the firm needs to be defined.
It needs an identity.
She's not wrong.
All-service firms tend to do too much.
No one knows what they're about.
So an all-women firm.
Does anybody want an all-women firm?
An all-women partner firm.
Some people do.
Some people think they know what they're buying into
with a female lawyer.
Softer.
More hand-holding.
I know, but what do you think?
Do we get paid more money?
I would.
Oh, great.
You probably would, too.
I like Cary.
I like Cary, too.
But...
But what?
No, it just seems like you were going to add a but.
No, it's just, before I left here,
Jason wanted me to be name partner.
Jason?
I mean, Will.
That was weird.
Will.
So, Jason, huh?
What?
Jason.
You having a good time together?
We're just... nothing.
So what do you think I should do?
Do I go with Diane?
Or...
do I tell Cary and David Lee
that she approached me?
Tell Cary.
Really?
Really.
Okay.
I'm turning my brain off.
I'm going home.
You want to get a drink?
No, I'm too tired.
Next time.
Long day.
Mmm... let's make it longer.
Thank you for helping out today.
Mmm, no problem.
Damn it.
Just ignore it.
Alicia, it's your mom!
Oh, come on.
It's not for you. It's for Jason.
I want to thank him.
That's my mom.
Get inside!
Don't let him in!
Alicia?
