cindy crawford ,
kathy ireland , claudia schiffer .
the &apos; 80s gave birth to the supermodel .
they had everything --
the hair , the bodies , the cheekbones .
a supermodel had to be perfect ,
but my brother was about to prove that wrong .
gentlemen , it appears my holiday shopping is done .
jealous ?
dude ! butt mug .
now you can drink hot cocoa out of a butt
&apos;cause it &apos;s a mug with a butt .
better get moving &apos; cause they only got a couple left .
oh , my mom is going to love that .
sweet butt mug , bro .
sure is .
have we met before ?
perhaps at the gucci show in milan , italy ?
no .
oh , sorry .
where do you model ?
where do i what ?
model .
i mean , clearly someone with your symmetrical face ,
perfect bone structure , and jazzy hair
is already working the circuit , right ?
you know , that hadn &apos;t occurred to me yet ,
but it makes total sense .
then today &apos;s my lucky day .
i &apos;m john calabasas . i &apos;m a talent scout .
do you have representation ?
hold up . are you for real ?
i &apos;m just a dude at a mall .
iman was discovered at a stop &apos;n go ,
kathy ireland at a sizzler ,
cindy crawford in a corn maze .
supermodels get discovered everywhere .
supermodel ? ! me ? !
you remind me of claudia schiffer before she worked with me .
claudia schiffer worked with you ? !
people like me , yes . and you can , too .
yeah , this really happened all the time back in the &apos; 80s .
scam artists would target naive dreamers
and promise them super stardom for a low fee .
you are blowing me away .
and my brother was as naive as they came .
big news , everyone !
i &apos;ve been personally selected to be a world @-@ famous model .
well , i think you &apos;re limiting yourself at world @-@ famous ,
but continue .
i was approached by a modeling scout in the mall .
he had a brochure and an official business card .
&quot; john calabasas , professional model finder . &quot;
good . he &apos;s legit .
all i have to do is give him $ 100,
take some classes , and soon , i &apos;ll be making
upwards of $ 10,000 a day being a supermodel .
you &apos;re a super moron .
mom &apos;s never gonna throw away $ 100 .
i made it out to cash .
when did you even write that ?
oh , my god . i &apos;ve been saying it for years
and now it &apos;s finally been confirmed .
my little monkey
is the most handsome boy on the planet .
hands off the money @-@ maker .
now , if you excuse me , i need to get some beauty rest .
wake me in 14 hours .
wait .
why don &apos;t you put some cucumbers on your eyes
like the models do ?
i feel it burning already .
burning ?
it burns so much !
oh , no .
i already dressed the salad .
it &apos;s lemon pepper vinaigrette .
ah , ah , my eyes , my beautiful deep brown eyes !
help me !
come on . be brave .
be brave .
it was december 28 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was gearing up to get my &quot; e.t. &quot; on .
back then , people loved it so much ,
it stayed in theaters for over a year ,
and no one loved it more than me .
man , i &apos;m so psyched that we &apos;re seeing &quot; e.t. &quot; again .
it &apos;s the 10th time , but it feels like the 3rd .
yeah , i hear 10 is when you really start
to appreciate the nuances .
wait a second .
you &apos;ve seen this movie that many times ?
why are you dragging me here
with all the damn holiday crowds ?
it &apos;s about a puppet .
a puppet ?
is fozzie bear just a puppet ?
is alf just a puppet ?
is yoda --
yes . those are all puppets .
murray .
that night , we had something even more rare
than an alien sighting -- my dad &apos;s dad , pop @-@ pop .
he was a man of few words .
so , uh , how &apos;s things and whatever you &apos;re doing ?
yep , my dad got it from somewhere .
you ?
like any grandpa , he knew everything about me .
barry .
that was actually a pretty good interaction with pop @-@ pop .
he had said over three words
and none of them were obscenities .
i &apos;ll be right here .
but that night ,
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about pop @-@ pop .
he lived in town and it was strange
how we barely ever saw him .
i never stopped to think if it bothered my dad
until this happened .
what the hell was that ?
whhhhy ?
is that horrible sound coming from your dad ?
i &apos;d always wanted to know
what it &apos;d be like to see my dad cry ,
but then i did and i instantly regretted it .
sounds like a goat being strangled .
just look at the screen and lose yourself in the movie .
i can &apos;t !
what are you wearing ?
it &apos;s called high fashion , erica .
check it .
i can casually flip my jacket over my shoulder .
dude , you &apos;re not a model .
just for saying that , you &apos;re not invited
to my oceanside condo in kokomo
where i &apos;ll windsurf with the beach boys .
god , you &apos;re an idiot .
all righty .
just finished ironing more outfits for your head shots .
this stuff if fabulous .
model walk , model walk , model walk ,
model walk , model walk , model walk .
mom , don &apos;t give him money . it &apos;s a scam .
these creeps troll the malls
looking for the vain , weak , and sad .
hey , barry was born to model .
okay , maybe not born because of his skull shape .
but when that helmet came off , it was like looking
at a baby boy version of cheryl tiegs .
he &apos;s gonna be crushed when he finds out the truth .
and that &apos;s on you .
fine .
if it &apos;ll make you feel better ,
i &apos;ll go down there and make sure it &apos;s all legit .
i know you think i &apos;ve always got my mom goggles on ,
but i &apos;m not as blind as you think .
look at that snuggle bug . he &apos;s gorgeous !
unbelievable .
are you sure you &apos;ve never done this before ?
mark my words , you &apos;re gonna be so rich and famous ,
you &apos;re gonna be able to hurt people without consequences .
yes !
oh , he &apos;s got a hair out of place .
you mind if i just poof him a little ?
please . poof away .
whoa , what is happening right now ? !
what ? did i mess him up ?
no .
do you mind if i take a couple of the two of you together ?
absolutely not !
we &apos;d love that .
you see , i get a ton of calls for mother / son teams ,
but it &apos;s always actors playing a part .
i &apos;ve never seen a mother love her child so much .
that &apos;s because no mother
ever has loved her child so much .
i &apos;ve never done this before .
but for another 100 bucks ,
i can make you a model , too , mom .
no way !
done . i made it out to cash .
when did you even write that ?
and so , they got to work .
and it was something , all right .
no . don &apos;t do that .
stop . get off of me !
stop !
come on .
no !
i don &apos;t want to be a model anymore .
while my mom was living her wildest dreams ,
i was still processing the nightmare of seeing my dad cry .
no way . that &apos;s impossible .
dad doesn &apos;t cry ever .
i know what i saw --
human tears coming out of his face .
what ?
what &apos;s going on ?
why &apos;s everyone staring at me ?
what &apos;s with all the staring ?
you cried !
when e.t. phoned home ,
he left and you cried and i saw it .
i did not !
i didn &apos;t even like the stupid movie .
dumb little alien .
all he wanted to do was get home .
then it turns all white and crusty like an old dog turd .
he loved that boy .
but still , he had to leave .
i don &apos;t want to talk about the damn movie anymore .
you &apos;re welling up . it &apos;s happening .
nothing &apos;s happening !
come back !
i want to see what it looks like !
cry for me !
cry for me !
after 25 years , the man cries at a puppet --
makes no sense .
unless it &apos;s not the puppet
but what the puppet represents .
we all know that &quot; e.t. &quot;
is about an absent father , right ?
no . what movie were you watching ?
all i saw was a magic frogman
build a telephone out of a speak &amp; spell .
it was a cry for help .
dad misses pop @-@ pop ,
and it &apos;s up to me to bring them back together .
not happening .
after your nana left , pop @-@ pop lived his life
filled with bitterness and anger ,
most of which was directed at your dad .
and the resentment that runs between them is bone @-@ deep .
man . that &apos;s a lot of anger .
and only a crazy , renegade han solo @-@ kind of guy
would try and fix it .
exactly .
wait . w @-@ what are you saying ?
so , i did what han solo would do in this situation --
lure his grandfather over with a free bowl of potato salad .
i got a plan and i need your help .
no , no plan .
that is not a nice man .
watch this .
long time no see , ben .
looking good .
so , you think you &apos;re better than me , huh ?
hey , pop @-@ pop , since you &apos;re here ,
i was wondering if maybe you could help me
with a history project for school .
you know what i did in school ?
quit so i could work .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
getting interviewed for a school project about our family .
wait a minute .
this just occurred to me right now in this moment .
you should do the interview together .
tell you what , adam .
just interview us old @-@ timers and murray can film it .
so , what do you say , fellas ?
we &apos;ll take that as a yes .
so , with a little help from pops ,
my plan was in motion .
now all i had to do
was get my closed @-@ off grandpa to open up .
okay , so i &apos;m just gonna ask a few questions ,
so speak from the heart .
dad , we rolling ?
no idea .
great . so , let &apos;s start off with an easy one .
what &apos;s your favorite thing in life ?
one word -- family .
when i was 6 years old , i worked in a button factory .
there was a terrible fire ,
but i got two days off -- two glorious days .
so , what do you say we shift gears
and talk about family specifically .
what &apos;s your best memory with your kids ?
the day bev was born .
pop @-@ pop ?
i got hit by a car when i was 29 .
it was a terrible accident .
but i got some money in the settlement ,
and decided to invest it in a new company called 7up .
well , until my genius son talked me out of it .
he hated clear soda .
and i missed out on the biggest opportunity of my life !
that &apos;s your best memory ?
i thought you said worst .
if we &apos;re doing awful memories ,
i got a few hundred of them .
okay , maybe we should take five .
how about when you left for a year to go sell frozen beef ...
so , apparently , getting my dad and pop @-@ pop
to open up about the past wasn &apos;t the best han solo move .
i had to come up with a plan &quot; b &quot; and fast .
hey , pop @-@ pop , do you want to see &quot; e.t. &quot; with me ?
no .
i have a coupon for free popcorn .
what size ?
medium ?
i have changed my mind and will go .
so , maybe i couldn &apos;t melt pop @-@ pop &apos;s heart ...
... but i knew a little puppet who could .
you &apos;re unreal !
being a supermodel is my dream .
i &apos;m not sharing the cover of vogue with my mom .
i &apos;ve worked too hard to get here .
let me just take one class with you
and see where it takes us .
sound like a plan ?
no !
my plan is to retire this face at 38
&apos;cause i &apos;m realistic and i know my looks won &apos;t last .
so , i start a super @-@ popular teen fashion line
called &quot; barry comfortable &quot; and then -- boom --
i retire to a beach mansion in kokomo without you .
you think you &apos;ll survive in kokomo without your mother ?
wrong .
kokomo will chew you up and spit you out .
find your own island paradise !
model walk , model walk , model walk , model walk .
good stuff .
it &apos;s just the normal fireworks of a creative partnership .
we really are the lennon and mccartney
of mother / son supermodeling teams .
calabasas really exploited your greatest weakness --
your love for us .
please !
you know nothing about that man .
actually ... i do .
i &apos;m gonna show you something ,
and you have to promise never to tell a single soul .
of course . i &apos;m great at keeping secrets .
what ? i &apos;m okay at it .
i am the worst . you shouldn &apos;t tell me .
i should go .
no .
you &apos;re going to sit there and listen .
a few years ago ,
john calabasas saw me in the mall
and said i could be a supermodel .
pops gave me the money to take his class .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
&apos;cause of what &apos;s in here .
there &apos;s your proof .
look at these tragic , awkward pictures
and tell me it &apos;s not a scam .
what ? yea-- no , you &apos;re adorable .
take off the mom goggles and really look .
it &apos;s a scam .
while my mom was feeling duped ,
i was attempting to get pop @-@ pop to feel anything .
and i was right there , ready to wipe his tears .
need a tissue ?
yeah .
or plug his ears .
i was all out of options .
tell me when it &apos;s over .
my pop @-@ pop was unfixable .
i don &apos;t get it .
how do you not feel bad for e.t. ?
i felt sorry for those poor feds
because they couldn &apos;t examine him properly
&apos;cause that stupid kid was always getting in the way .
what ?
that elliott ought to be locked up .
you see something , you report it .
who watches &quot; e.t. &quot; and sides with the fbi agents ?
who does that ? !
an american .
that martian had a magic finger .
we don &apos;t know if he can weaponize that .
it &apos;s not a weapon .
that finger &apos;s for healing purposes only .
but we don &apos;t know till we cut him up and see how he ticks .
oh , my god ! what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
me ?
you &apos;re the deluded one , barry .
i blame your dad .
this is what happens when you go soft on your kids .
they end up honest @-@ to @-@ god morons .
adam . my name is adam .
see you around , pop @-@ pop .
while the reality of who pop @-@ pop was finally sunk in ,
barry was about to face a reality of his own .
okay , here comes barry .
now &apos;s the time to tell him
that he &apos;s way too unappealing to be a model .
no sweat . i got this .
hide your daughters !
there &apos;s the most handsome boy on the planet !
mom .
fine .
honey , uh , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got some really bad news .
yeah , me too .
i just learned that something
we &apos;re really stoked about &apos;s a total sham .
there is no kokomo .
what ?
i just made some calls to the airlines to price tickets .
turns out the beach boys made it up .
honey , there &apos;s something else i need to talk to you about .
i know .
i feel bad about our fight , and i &apos;m sorry .
i think i got upset &apos; cause no one ever told me
i was handsome before .
what ? !
every day , i tell you
you &apos;re the most handsome boy in the world .
but here &apos;s the thing --
your words mean nothing to me .
but when a stranger said it ,
then i realized it was true .
and nothing can change that ,
even you being a model , too .
so , let &apos;s do it .
let &apos;s supermodel together .
yes !
there may not be an actual kokomo ,
but we &apos;re gonna make enough supermodel money to build one .
well , i give up .
model walk .
model walk , model walk ,
model walk , model walk , model walk .
way to let him down easy , mom .
don &apos;t you worry .
if my delicious boy wants to be a model ,
mama &apos;s gonna make him one .
you &apos;re okay , right ?
no .
but you &apos;re getting over it ?
no .
where &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s usually , uh , good with this stuff .
beverly ? !
you probably just want to be alone .
no .
beverly , where are you ? !
fine .
um , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m getting rid of all my &quot; e.t. &quot; stuff .
pop @-@ pop ruined it for me .
what &apos;d he say ?
he called me a moron .
he can &apos;t do that !
where you going ?
put on your coat .
we &apos;re gonna have a little talk with your grandfather .
yep , my dad had a very strict rule .
only he was allowed to call me moron .
what &apos;s with all the knocking ?
for god &apos;s sakes , put some pants on .
it makes people uncomfortable .
said my dad .
what is it you want from me ?
i want you to apologize to my son .
for what ?
for calling him a moron !
apologize !
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re a moron .
fine ! you don &apos;t want to say you &apos;re sorry .
i will .
i &apos;m sorry you worked in a button factory .
i &apos;m sorry you didn &apos;t invest in 7up .
and i &apos;m sorry that mom left when we were young ,
leaving you stuck with two kids you didn &apos;t want !
but you know what i &apos;m most sorry about ?
i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re such a miserable man
that you &apos;re gonna miss out on your grandkids &apos; lives
the same way you missed out on mine .
happy new year , dad .
all i &apos;d wanted was to bring everyone closer together ,
but what i really did was drive them further apart .
yes , people . own it .
spines straight now . keep those spines straight .
does anybody know a four @-@ letter word
for a mongolian tent made of skins ?
it &apos;s a scam .
you &apos;re not models . none of us are .
shh ! please lower your voice , okay ?
and if you &apos;re here to get your money back ,
that tiny sign over there semi @-@ clearly says , &quot; no refunds . &quot;
i don &apos;t want a refund .
i want my beautiful boy to be a model .
look , mrs. goldberg ,
i may have painted a bit of a rosy picture .
i can &apos;t just get your son a job
because it &apos;s , like , really hard to be a model .
did you hear that ?
he said it &apos;s really hard to be a model .
please , i need you to stay focused , okay ?
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of distractions
just like this on the catwalks of paris .
why don &apos;t you just beat it ?
okay , i &apos;ll leave .
but barry had better get a gig .
and if that doesn &apos;t happen
i &apos;ll call the better business bureau ,
the chamber of commerce , and the 6 : 00 news .
i might even call your mother . how would you like that ?
please do not call my mom .
we have a very complicated relationship .
then you best get to work .
meanwhile ,
i wasn &apos;t sure if my dad was mad at pop @-@ pop or me ,
but i thought my best move
was to forget the whole thing happened .
so ... do you have any new year &apos;s resolutions ?
i &apos;m thinking about cutting back on fruit roll @-@ ups .
i &apos;m sorry you had to see me blow up like that .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
pops was right . i shouldn &apos;t have mixed in .
well , then , why did you ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe ...
because ...
i don &apos;t want there to be a world
where we live a mile away and never speak .
look at me .
that will never be us .
really ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll always be right here .
sure , our family wasn &apos;t perfect ,
but nothing &apos;s ever unfixable .
guess who just booked his first modeling gig .
you can suck it .
i am very proud and not at all surprised .
i never really believed this could have happened .
but you always did .
and i always will .
oh , boopie .
nice work , handsome .
model walk , model walk .
model walk , model walk , model walk .
barry may not have been an actual supermodel .
and we may not have always been what you &apos;d call a model family ...
given all the yelling and fighting that went on all the time .
do you have to do that ?
you &apos;re gonna start the new year off acting like an idiot .
but in our house , it wasn &apos;t about being perfect .
it was about being together .
dad .
everything okay ?
i pickled some beets .
it &apos;s your mom &apos;s recipe .
you want to join us ?
no , it &apos;s , uh , family time .
you &apos;re family .
thanks , adam .
get in here . the countdown &apos;s starting .
three , two ...
one !
happy new year !
&apos;cause that &apos;s what new year &apos;s is for .
it &apos;s a time for new beginnings ...
a time to appreciate the people you love ...
even if sometimes they body @-@ slam you .
but more importantly ,
it &apos;s a time to look forward to the new year that maybe , just maybe ...
will be even better than the last .
stop it .
happy new year .
happy new year .
nice . great .
hello , mother / son magazine .
now , that &apos;s a touch of class .
oh , look who &apos;s going to the prom together .
stop it !
get off me ! i don &apos;t want to be a model anymore !
