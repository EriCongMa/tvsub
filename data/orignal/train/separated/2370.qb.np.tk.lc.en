does elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar ?
i &apos;ve heard about you .
the crazy , impulsive vampire .
in love with his brother &apos;s girl .
where &apos;s stefan ?
he gave himself over to klaus . to save his brother .
klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline .
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting .
but if he breaks it ,
he &apos;ll be a true hybrid .
i want to create more of me .
now , you being the first werewolf i &apos;ve come across ,
i need you to direct me to your pack .
you know i died , right ?
and bonnie used magic to bring me back to life .
ever since i came back ,
i &apos;ve been seeing things i shouldn &apos;t be seeing .
vickie ? !
did you just say &quot; vickie , &quot;
as in my sister vickie ?
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire .
so don &apos;t be his friend . do you understand me ?
promise me no one will find out about us .
mrs. lockwood .
leaving so soon ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you &apos;ve been tracking klaus &apos; victims ?
because they &apos;re not klaus &apos; victims , elena , they &apos;re stefan &apos;s !
what ?
he &apos;s flipped the switch .
stefan is gone and he &apos;s not coming back .
hello ?
stefan ?
stefan , if this is you ...
you &apos;ll be okay .
whether suicide or a tragic accident ?
wkpw news has lost one of its shining stars .
daily reporter and weekend anchor
andie star was discovered ...
just can &apos;t stay away , can you ?
you &apos;ve been dodging my calls .
yeah , well , busy dating a dead fake girlfriend and all .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
happy birthday , elena . stefan killed andie .
cake ?
he called me , damon .
what ?
stefan called me last night .
well , what &apos;d he say ?
he didn &apos;t say anything , but it was him .
i asked sheriff forbes if she would
trace the call &apos;s origin .
it came from tennessee .
where he &apos;s binge drinking on the country folk .
we went through this , elena .
stefan &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t mean geographically .
if he was gone , he wouldn &apos;t have called .
go away , damon !
hi .
you &apos;re , uh ...
not who i expected .
i need you to tell me what you know
about stefan and tennessee .
did you miss the part
where i checked out of all this ?
come on , ric . whatever damon knows , you know .
ask damon .
yeah , but damon &apos;s not exactly in the mood to help right now .
for good reason .
because it &apos;s not safe for him .
stefan &apos;s off the rails .
yeah , but he &apos;s still holding on to his humanity ,
which means he can still be saved .
and why do you have to be the one to save him ?
because i &apos;m not the kind of person who checks out .
look , he would never give up on me .
i &apos;m not gonna give up on him .
tell me what you know , ric .
please .
they &apos;ve been tracking werewolves .
he and klaus all over the eastern seaboard .
we thought we had &apos; em just outside of memphis .
you ok ? is ray getting heavy ?
i &apos;m fine .
you sure about that ?
you know , we &apos;ve been walking for quite some time now .
if you need some water or a little sit @-@ down ...
you know , i get that we &apos;re , uh--we &apos;re stuck together ,
but if we could maybe just skip the chitchat ,
it &apos;d be great .
so much brooding .
your self @-@ loathing is suffocating you , my friend .
maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m a little tired of hunting werewolves .
we &apos;ve been at it all summer .
thanks to our pal ray , we found ourselves a pack .
there .
ray ! oh , my god .
what &apos;s going on ?
who are you ?
the important question is who am i.
please forgive the intrusion .
my name is klaus .
you &apos;re the hybrid .
you &apos;ve heard of me . fantastic .
hey , mom .
morning , sweetheart .
coffee &apos;s hot .
rough night ?
uh , rough week . i &apos;m a little stressed . you ?
feeling pretty good .
you know , if you &apos;re going to bring a girl home ,
i wish she &apos;d have the tact to not sneak out like a prostitute .
i &apos;m sorry .
she snuck out ?
i think the cream &apos;s bad .
don &apos;t wait up tonight .
oh , and caroline ,
she &apos;s not a prostitute .
bill , it &apos;s , um , carol lockwood .
i &apos;ve gotten myself
into a bit of a vampire situation .
please tell me you &apos;re not turning into one of these losers
that hangs out at work on his day off .
you remember what we talked about last night ,
how i &apos;ve been seeing things ?
honestly , jer , last night is kind of a blur .
well , i saw her again . i saw vicki .
why are you--why are you telling me this ?
you &apos;re dating a witch . why don &apos;t you tell her ?
tell bonnie that she brought me back to life
and now i &apos;m seeing my dead girlfriend ?
we don &apos;t need a witch , ok ?
there &apos;s examples all over the internet .
we need ...
personal items ,
and it works best when a family member tries to make contact .
no , no , no , no , no , no . we &apos;re--
we &apos;re not contacting my sister .
she said , &quot; help me . &quot;
if you &apos;re messing with me , man ...
i saw her , matt .
she asked for help .
look , you &apos;re the one she loved the most .
if anyone &apos;s gonna be able to help me connect to her ,
it &apos;s you .
a lot of us like to keep to ourselves for the full moon ,
chain ourselves up .
but there are some werewolves
that like to gather in places
where they don &apos;t have to do that ,
where they can enjoy it .
what kind of places ?
mountains , state parks , deserts , that kind of stuff .
anywhere in tennessee ?
yeah . here . give me your phone .
i &apos;ll try to pull up a map .
thanks for this .
i know it &apos;s asking a lot .
as caroline likes to remind me ,
stefan &apos;s in this mess because i bit damon .
i figure i owe you one .
have you talked to her today ?
no . why ?
just curious .
here .
that &apos;s your best bet .
did you get anything ?
how do you feel about a little hike through the smoky mountains ?
you wanna hunt down a pack of werewolves on a full moon ?
we &apos;ll be out of there before the moon is full .
if you don &apos;t come with me , i &apos;m going by myself .
what ? you &apos;re the one who told me
that i could handle things on my own now .
yeah , i meant like frozen dinners and sats .
a @-@ all right , fine .
let &apos;s just ... let &apos;s just go .
but , uh , you &apos;re driving .
it &apos;s fascinating , actually .
a werewolf who isn &apos;t beholden to the moon .
a vampire who doesn &apos;t burn in the sun .
a true hybrid .
excellent timing , ray .
very dramatic .
what &apos;s happening to me ?
stefan .
are any of you human ?
your friend here needs human blood
to complete his transition to vampire .
if he doesn &apos;t get it , he will die .
doesn &apos;t take much .
just a sample .
anyone ? a boyfriend , a girlfriend ? along for the ride ?
you .
no !
if you don &apos;t drink it , ray , i will .
problem is i don &apos;t know how to stop .
it &apos;s the new order , sweetheart .
you join us , or you die .
i &apos;d rather die than be a vampire .
wrong choice .
she &apos;ll thank me for that later . heh .
ok , who &apos;s next ?
you moving in or something ? you &apos;ve been here forever .
i thought i was meeting caroline .
you haven &apos;t seen her , have you ?
not keeping up on her comings and goings anymore .
look , man , i never meant for me and her being friends
to be a problem for you .
it is what it is .
tonight &apos;s a full moon .
she usually helps you ?
yeah .
whatever .
do you , uh ...
is this like the kind of thing that you need another person for ?
i can handle it .
but thanks .
ahh . what is up with my taste buds today ?
heh . it &apos;s the vervain .
the sheriff has me slip
it into the coffee here every now and then .
that &apos;s what vervain tastes like ?
yeah . i &apos;m surprised you can taste it .
the coffee usually hides the flavor ,
for humans anyway .
thank you so much for coming .
does anyone else know you &apos;re here ?
no . i didn &apos;t drive through town . i came straight here .
can i offer you a drink ?
i think you should tell me what you expect me to do .
i was hoping you could tell me .
it &apos;s caroline , bill .
i remember the day she was born .
what does the rest of the council know ?
i haven &apos;t said a word .
i &apos;ve been putting this together on my own for months now .
any ideas how to handle this ?
i can &apos;t get my hands dirty here for a lot of reasons .
she &apos;s a vampire , carol .
we do what we have to do .
in a couple hours ,
the full moon &apos;s gonna rise just above that ridge .
if tyler &apos;s right , that &apos;s where the pack &apos;ll be .
you were a boy scout , weren &apos;t you ?
shut up .
a boy scout , slash vampire slayer .
slash whiskey @-@ drinking all @-@ around lost cause .
wow . you came stocked .
well , we aren &apos;t exactly bird @-@ watching .
here .
put that in your bag .
vervain grenade ?
wolfsbane .
well , since we &apos;re exchanging gifts ...
that &apos;s john gilbert &apos;s ring .
it was yours once .
go ahead .
take it . it &apos;ll protect you from whatever supernatural danger
we &apos;re about to get ourselves into .
he gave it to you .
yeah , but i &apos;m a doppelganger .
it &apos;s not gonna work on me .
he left it for if i ever have kids .
yeah , well , then why don &apos;t you save it for future generations
of stubborn , relentless baby gilberts ?
ok , and how about you borrow it until after we survive this ?
i &apos;d feel bad if i got you killed before happy hour .
i don &apos;t know why you think that you &apos;re a lost cause .
damon !
how are you even here ?
thanks for the tip , brother .
you sold me out .
think i &apos;d take you to a mountain range
of werewolves on a full moon without backup ?
there .
good as new .
now you relax , ok , mate ?
we &apos;re gonna need you when the rest of them wake up .
they &apos;re dead .
they &apos;re all dead .
ah , he &apos;s through his transition .
he should be feeling better soon .
so is this your master plan ?
build an army of hybrid slaves ?
no , not slaves .
soldiers , comrades .
for what war , might i ask ?
oh , you don &apos;t arm yourself after war has been declared , stefan .
you build your army so big that no one ever dares pick the fight .
what makes you so sure that they &apos;ll be loyal ?
well , it &apos;s not difficult to be loyal
when you &apos;re on the winning team .
that &apos;s something you &apos;ll learn
once you shake that horribly depressive chip off your shoulder .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re , uh--you &apos;re keeping me around ?
to witness my attitude adjustment ?
you &apos;ll know why i &apos;m keeping you around
when i &apos;ve decided that i want you to know .
something &apos;s wrong .
that shouldn &apos;t be happening , should it ?
well , obviously .
get out of the water , elena .
if i get out of the water , you &apos;re gonna make me go home .
yes , because i &apos;m not an idiot like you .
right now , you &apos;re both acting like idiots .
you gave up on him , damon .
i didn &apos;t give up on him , elena .
i faced reality . now get out of the water .
no !
what &apos;s your big plan , elena ?
you gonna walk into a campsite full of werewolves ,
roast a marshmallow , and wait for stefan to stop by ?
my plan is to find him and help him .
damon , this is the closest that we &apos;ve been to him since he left .
i &apos;m not going home .
klaus thinks you died when he broke the curse .
that makes you safe .
this , this is not safe .
i &apos;m not leaving before we find him .
it &apos;s a full moon tonight , elena .
then we &apos;ll find him before then .
damon , please .
ok . ok .
but we are out of here before the moon is full
and i &apos;m werewolf bait .
i promise .
unless you wanna relive
that whole deathbed kissy thing .
i said i promise .
fine .
you said it was gonna feel better .
why doesn &apos;t it feel better ?
some master race .
lose the attitude .
derek , come feed your girlfriend .
go get him .
how you doing ?
fine .
you know , i could help you .
no , thanks .
just one little hwoosh .
yeah , with my luck , you &apos;d drop me .
wait , are you twelve ?
where did he go ?
he , uh--he got away . forget him . let &apos;s go .
a fatal werewolf bite .
ouch .
yeah . i &apos;m gonna need your blood to heal me .
well , i tell you what .
you find ray , and then i &apos;ll heal you .
can &apos;t be serious .
you better hurry , &apos; cause that bite looks nasty .
you put vervain in my coffee this morning .
why ?
vervain ?
what are you talking about ?
let &apos;s skip the part where we pretend
we don &apos;t know about the vampires in this town .
you were testing me
to see if i was a vampire . i want to know why .
you &apos;ve been spending so much time with caroline .
i had to know for sure .
what does caroline have to do with it ?
let &apos;s skip the part where
we pretend she &apos;s not one of them .
did you do something to her ?
tyler , i don &apos;t want you to be with her .
where is she , mom ?
i can &apos;t let you be together .
what did you do to her ? where is she ?
you can &apos;t be with her .
she &apos;s a monster .
you don &apos;t know about me , do you ?
know what ?
know what , tyler ?
we got about a mile left .
the sun &apos;s about to set .
i can see that , damon .
i &apos;m just saying .
the moon doesn &apos;t reach its apex
for a while . we have time .
stay where you are .
vampire .
damon !
let me guess . hybrid .
so this is all her stuff .
we were supposed to donate it , but , uh , you know .
well , everything i read said that personal items
help build a stronger connection .
does her pipe count ?
i don &apos;t know why i let you talk me into this , man .
it &apos;s because she &apos;s your sister
and you have a chance to help her .
i can &apos;t do this .
you gotta go .
matt , please .
nah , man .
i can &apos;t do this , all right ? you gotta go .
these ropes aren &apos;t gonna hold him much longer .
what else do we have ?
ric , here . take these .
i said ric .
all right , let me see .
all right , that &apos;s the last of the vervain .
we don &apos;t have enough stuff to hold him .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re gonna make that ridge
before the full moon .
if we can get him to talk ,
we don &apos;t have to .
is he turning ?
it &apos;s impossible . it &apos;s still daylight .
tell him that .
there aren &apos;t supposed to
be werewolves out here until the moon is full .
you know , those ropes aren &apos;t gonna hold the wolf .
damon , we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
we gotta get out of these mountains now !
damon , now !
bad news , my friend .
end of the road for you .
careful , love .
there &apos;s only one alpha here .
bloody hell .
don &apos;t move .
here , doggie , doggie .
come on . let &apos;s keep moving .
we can &apos;t leave damon .
he can handle himself . let &apos;s move .
no . if he gets bit , he &apos;ll be dead .
i &apos;m the reason he &apos;s out here .
i am the reason he &apos;s out here .
i told him where we were ,
and i &apos;m telling you to keep moving . let &apos;s go .
elena , now .
tyler , what is it ?
just--just tell me .
you need to see for yourself .
what are you doing ?
you think caroline &apos;s a monster ?
i &apos;m the monster , mom .
what ?
tyler , what &apos;s happening ?
get in .
get in .
no .
get in !
tyler , what are you doing ?
me , uncle mason , it &apos;s in our blood .
it &apos;s our family curse .
what curse ?
tyler , what &apos;s happening ? !
what &apos;s happening ?
oh , my god !
ohh ! no ! ohh !
fancy meeting you here .
what part of &quot; don &apos;t follow me anymore . &quot;
got lost in translation , damon ?
might want to take it up with your girlfriend .
you don &apos;t want her chasing you ,
you have to stop with the late @-@ night phone calls .
i didn &apos;t call her .
sure you did .
she &apos;s not gonna give up on you .
well , she has to .
because i &apos;m never coming back .
why don &apos;t you get her home ?
see if you could keep her there this time .
stefan &apos;s out there somewhere
and now damon ,
and we &apos;re just sitting in this car ?
let the vampires fight the hybrid zombie mountain man .
i &apos;ll take care of keeping the humans safe .
i thought you were checked out of taking care of people .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
don &apos;t .
there doesn &apos;t need to be a lesson here .
you &apos;re better at it than you think , you know ?
oh , boy , are you a sucker for a lost cause or what ?
you &apos;re not a lost cause , ric .
you &apos;re just lost .
but so is jeremy , and so am i.
our family is gone .
we don &apos;t have anybody .
i &apos;m sorry , but you don &apos;t have anybody either , so ...
we &apos;re kind of right for each other .
i &apos;m keeping the ring , then .
damon .
are you ok ? did you ...
fine , bite @-@ free . get back in the car , please .
can you just give me a minute to
appreciate that you &apos;re not dead ?
i &apos;ll give you 10 seconds .
9 , 8
hey , ric , did you happen
to see where i parked my car ?
damon , stop being such a caveman .
6 ...
i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
hey , don &apos;t worry about it , man .
you know , it &apos;s , uh-- it &apos;s a lot to ask .
heh . come on in .
i spent the day going through her stuff .
it was weird ,
you know , all the memories .
i realize that most people didn &apos;t really get vic .
you know , they saw her as trouble and let it go at that .
but you really got her .
you know , you--you got her
better than i did most of the time .
so ...
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re gonna do with all this ,
but here .
you know , i don &apos;t remember her dying .
i don &apos;t know if caroline told you that
when she told you everything .
nah , she didn &apos;t .
elena made them take that memory away from me ,
that i couldn &apos;t handle it .
so whatever my last moment was with her ,
i don &apos;t have it .
i don &apos;t either .
i don &apos;t remember the last moment
i had with vicki before she was a vampire ...
when she was still my sister .
matty .
do you see something ?
is she here ?
you said you needed help .
tell me how i can help you , please .
i can come back .
help me come back .
what is she saying ? tell me .
jeremy .
don &apos;t trust vicki .
they went rabid .
some of them , i killed .
the others just ...
bled out .
in the end ...
they &apos;re all dead .
i did everything i was told !
i should be able to turn them .
i broke the curse . i killed a werewolf .
i killed a vampire .
i killed the doppelganger .
you look like hell .
last i checked , i &apos;m dying ...
and you don &apos;t want to heal me .
i had to take him out .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i failed you .
i &apos;m sorry .
do what you have to do .
it should have worked .
bottoms up .
we &apos;re leaving .
it appears you &apos;re the only comrade i have left .
seriously ?
i was wrong .
are you drunk ?
no .
i thought stefan was gone , but i was wrong .
you saw him out there ?
damon , is he ok ?
no , he &apos;s not ok , elena .
he &apos;s an insufferable martyr that needs his ass kicked ...
but he can be saved .
what happened out there ?
what changed your mind ?
i changed my mind because even in his darkest place ,
my brother still can &apos;t let me die .
so i figure i owe him the same in return .
i &apos;ll help you bring him back .
thank you .
but before i do ,
i need you to answer one question .
what made you change your mind ?
what do you mean ?
you were so hellbent on staying on that mountain .
then you just gave up . so what changed your mind ?
we were under attack , damon .
you had a bag full of weapons
and a teacher with an eternity ring .
you could have kept going .
it was too dangerous .
it was too dangerous going out there
to begin with , so what was it ?
why are you being like this ?
what changed your mind , elena ?
i didn &apos;t want to see you get hurt , ok ?
i was ...
i was worried about you .
thanks .
yes , i worry about you .
why do you even have to hear me say it ?
because when i drag my brother from the edge
and deliver him back to you ,
i want you to remember
the things you felt while he was gone .
good night , elena .
how &apos;s it going , ric ?
know what you &apos;re doing there ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i &apos;ll make sure nothing happens to her .
thank you .
i think we made a mistake .
carol , you called me in to take care of this problem .
why the sudden change of heart ?
maybe a guilty conscience .
don &apos;t feel guilty .
they &apos;re not human .
they &apos;re monsters .
what if we &apos;re wrong ?
my family &apos;s been committed to this fight
for almost 150 years , carol .
you married into it , so maybe you don &apos;t understand ,
but i do .
i know what my obligations are .
wait .
hello !
mrs. lockwood ? !
somebody !
who &apos;s that ?
mrs. lockwood ? !
please .
hello , caroline .
