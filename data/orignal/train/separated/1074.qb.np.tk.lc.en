david siegel .
cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum .
what do you want ?
you &apos;re gonna help set me free .
the mosconi codex .
you want me to risk jail for a little light reading ?
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
i know that the codex leads to the window .
isn &apos;t it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me ?
the decoder lens . it doesn &apos;t work on ours .
because it &apos;s a copy . so what &apos;s the plan ?
leverage the decoder for the evidence tape .
then you &apos;ll be free .
depends on peter .
you robbed a vault under my watch .
i can explain .
don &apos;t you dare try to justify it .
i did it for you !
why should we lose everything ?
what does it say about me if i let this go ?
neal , you robbed a vault under my watch .
i can explain .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t you dare try to justify what you did .
i put myself out on the line for you all the time !
i nearly lost everything--
i did it for you !
make sure dawson has authenticated the confession .
he took a bribe . i did the right thing .
no , it isn &apos;t right .
what does it say about me if i let this go ?
that &apos;s not justice . you &apos;re--you &apos;re innocent .
i did the right thing .
why should we lose everything ?
none of this is right . things are gonna change .
i &apos;ve been promoted . i turned them in .
don &apos;t you dare try to justify what you did .
that &apos;s not justice . you &apos;re--you &apos;re innocent .
why should we lose everything ?
i did it for you !
this is burke .
i catch you at a bad time ?
bruce , hey , sorry .
i was on a run .
you can relax .
section chiefs don &apos;t go through standard physical evals .
section chief .
they want me in d.c. ?
there was an opening at hq .
the higher @-@ ups took some convincing ,
but i was able to push you for it .
job &apos;s yours .
you need to catch your breath ?
no , i--
you know , i gotta be honest , it &apos;s--
this is not the best time .
i have case files and pending case files .
it &apos;s just--
there will always be cases pending .
i trust you trained the people under you well enough to handle them .
when would i have to be in d.c. ?
two weeks .
that &apos;s awfully soon .
peter , are you ready to leave white collar or not ?
new case ?
potential art forgery at the sullivan auction house .
figured it &apos;d be the perfect assignment for you and caffrey .
you and i can take care of it .
can we talk ?
what &apos;s on your mind ?
well , i was gonna ask you the same thing .
i &apos;m fine .
yeah , sure , you &apos;re fine ,
until i mention caffrey &apos;s name .
then , you look like you wanna punch a hole through the wall .
it &apos;s not that obvious , is it ?
not to anyone else here ,
but i &apos;ve known the both of you long enough
to tell when something &apos;s up .
look , i don &apos;t know what happened ,
and i &apos;m not gonna ask ,
but i just think it &apos;s time to end the cycle .
cycle ?
yeah .
you know , the one where neal does something wrong ,
finds a way to justify it ,
and puts you in the hot seat as a result .
so it is that obvious .
well , peter , you have an opportunity
few agents in this bureau ever see ,
and you should have moved on to it by now .
i mean , you &apos;ve let one ci hold you back long enough .
i have a few loose ends here that need tying up .
i &apos;m all for tying up loose ends ,
as long as they aren &apos;t caffrey .
and peter , you--
you always take responsibility for him ,
but maybe it &apos;s time he starts
taking responsibility for himself .
that &apos;s all i wanna say .
so how long will the suit box you out ?
oh , he &apos;ll call me when he needs me .
his words ?
more or less .
i &apos;m guessing more , but you &apos;re not wearing
handcuffs and an orange onesie .
that means something .
that means he doesn &apos;t wanna go back to prison .
yet he blames you for his freedom .
he can &apos;t see past the fact that the law was broken .
irony has seldom been more perverse .
well , this all started with hagen .
today , it ends with him .
he wants the window , i want the blackmail he &apos;s got on me ,
and i don &apos;t plan to walk away with nothing .
yeah , neither does he .
so it &apos;s time to make a trade .
where is it ?
in a safe place .
but you &apos;re not getting the window ,
not today .
that wasn &apos;t what we agreed .
i &apos;m renegotiating .
new deal in play .
you get the window , i get the video of me
stealing those gold coins .
i thought you might be inclined to
try something like this ,
so i brought along a little incentive for you to consider .
are you considering , neal ?
where is she ?
if you ever want to see her again ,
you will let go of me .
if you hurt her , i swear--
what ?
she is innocent in all of this .
i disagree , she &apos;s in your life ,
and that makes her fair game .
no , this is between you and me .
rebecca was never a part of our deal .
well , she is now , and i have her .
don &apos;t presume to know what i &apos;m capable of .
this address .
you have 30 minutes to deliver the window .
if you contact the fbi , she &apos;s dead .
you try anything clever , she &apos;s dead .
oh , and if you forget to bring
the little bald friend of yours along ,
well , you get the picture .
look i @-@ i need more than 30 minutes .
that &apos;s all you have . that &apos;s maybe all she has .
anything ?
still no audio .
and no indication of where she is .
the visual &apos;s too tight .
what about a trace ?
according to my software ,
this image is being transmitted from a cell tower
halfway around the world .
hagen covered his tracks .
yeah , he &apos;s bouncing the signal around like a beach ball .
how are we for time ?
11 minutes .
what about the address he gave us ?
that &apos;s an empty train station .
been closed for years . this could be a trap .
i don &apos;t care , i &apos;m getting her back no matter what .
i thought you might say that .
fortunately , i &apos;m always prepared .
a listening device .
a transmitter with gps tracking .
this earwig acts as the receiver .
if i plant it on hagen ,
he could lead us to rebecca .
it &apos;s a big if , but it &apos;s an option .
maybe our only one .
neal , it &apos;s not the only one .
no .
no , it &apos;s too risky , all right ?
he could help us .
after everything peter and i just went through ,
there &apos;s no telling what he &apos;ll do .
i &apos;m on my own .
no . we &apos;re on our own .
ten minutes and counting . let &apos;s go .
hey .
hey , honey .
you okay ?
better now .
you know , i could &apos;ve met you at the office .
no , it &apos;s nicer here .
yeah .
bruce called .
i start the section chief job in washington in two weeks .
two weeks ?
yup .
wow . okay .
two weeks .
okay , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve planned parties with less preparation .
i can do this , we &apos;ve gotta put the house on the market ,
and pack everything up .
and we haven &apos;t even decided on a neighborhood .
it doesn &apos;t feel right .
honey , we-- we &apos;ve had this discussion .
i know , but you &apos;re the only person
i can talk to about this .
and i will always listen ,
but you were innocent .
you deserve to be free .
i &apos;ve made my peace with what neal did ,
but i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;ve made peace with myself .
for what ?
for accepting it . the timing of this--
is a sign for you to move on .
honey , there &apos;s something else .
so that &apos;s what this is about .
i can &apos;t leave until i know the whole truth ,
until i really know what happened
to david siegel that day .
work ?
yeah .
possible forgery at an auction house .
i &apos;m interviewing the manager in 15 .
should i dare to ask ?
no . neal &apos;s not working with me on this .
what ?
you said you made your peace with what he did .
that &apos;s right .
have you actually made your peace with him ?
when it comes to work ,
i can &apos;t let emotions cloud my judgment .
i think you already have .
we &apos;re here .
i brought you the glass . it &apos;s yours .
now tell me where rebecca is .
this is a very small window .
the--the pane acts as a filter .
my guess , you hold it over the original codex ,
and you &apos;ll see the hidden message mosconi placed in it .
now let her go .
you &apos;re a little taller than i pictured .
a little hackier than i pictured .
let &apos;s see ms. lowe then , shall we ?
no .
i came through on my end .
yes , you did .
but now , i &apos;m renegotiating .
the original chapter 13 .
there is a message here .
and you want us to stay and figure it out .
he &apos;s smart , and you &apos;re slippery ,
so better i keep an eye on you both .
how do i know she stays safe ?
funny , isn &apos;t it ? don &apos;t need a gun .
don &apos;t even need blackmail anymore .
just one striking image .
look .
if you want us to solve this puzzle ,
you have to tell us everything ,
chapter 13 , the stained glass , the masons .
first , where does this all begin ?
this all began with another striking image .
this one .
this is a mosconi .
i was restoring the mural several years ago
when i noticed something .
each shade of light is different .
cambridge , cobalt , indigo , teal .
13 distinct hues of blue .
legend has it that the masons entrusted mosconi
with something of great value .
he ensured its safety by hiding it
shortly before he left this country ,
but not without leaving a trail .
those hues that you identified
are the beginning of that trail .
13 is a sacred number for the masons .
he never referenced it in any other work but one .
the codex .
chapter 13 .
so , uh , what &apos;s the pot of gold ?
you wouldn &apos;t believe me if i told you .
it &apos;s peter . we &apos;ve got a case .
agent burke can wait .
i don &apos;t think you get it .
if i don &apos;t show up , peter gets suspicious .
if he gets suspicious , he checks my anklet ,
which leads him right here .
fine , but your friend stays . any--
i wanna talk to her before i leave .
i &apos;ll stand right here until you hand me the phone .
rebecca , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s neal .
i can &apos;t hear her .
she can hear you . and that &apos;s good enough .
listen to me . i &apos;m coming for you . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of there . just--
bad form to keep a lady waiting .
hurry along to agent burke .
i &apos;ll have this all figured out before you get back .
just go .
if anything happens to her or him ,
you &apos;ll see what i &apos;m capable of .
tell me what you see .
a lot of people ,
but i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find waldo in there somewhere .
i &apos;m not in the mood for levity .
well then , let &apos;s not waste any time .
you have someplace else to be ?
you rang , i came . is there a problem ?
your tone , for starters .
insubordinate ?
edgy . what &apos;s going on ?
of course i &apos;m edgy .
you &apos;re upset with me ,
and i have no idea what i can do or say to make it right .
just do your job .
mr. rawling , you &apos;re the house manager ?
you must be agent burke .
this is my colleague neal caffrey .
is this the piece in question ?
a vision of the last judgment by william blake ,
thought to have been lost for over 200 years .
how did it come to your auction house ?
anonymous seller .
i &apos;d have called us as well .
of course , gentlemen , i do have the information for the seller ,
but i can &apos;t provide it
until the painting has been proven inauthentic .
you don &apos;t wanna upset the vendor
and risk your commission . understandable .
neal ?
okay . let &apos;s see what we see .
tracing sheets won &apos;t help .
anything placed between the page and the glass
distorts the concealed image .
tell me something useful .
okay .
um , there &apos;s a certain tiger fish
that &apos;s been known to eat crocodiles .
you are an odd little creature .
yeah , and you &apos;re a stock thug .
you can &apos;t even do your own dirty work .
your obvious weakness is your hubris .
you speak with such authority .
i &apos;ve dealt with guys like you before .
then you know we have big teeth
and very little patience .
stay focused .
there &apos;s a hidden image on each page .
it looks like it &apos;s from some ancient language .
trace the images .
paint directly on mosconi &apos;s pages ?
we need to line them up
so we can see the bigger picture .
you &apos;ll destroy the original chapter 13 .
is it so difficult for you to take a leap of faith ?
i reserve my leaps of faith
for space exploration and the chupacabra .
i thought you were the artist .
show me what you can do .
oil and tempera paints are aged perfectly ,
mixed what just the right amount of chalk .
if it &apos;s a forgery , it &apos;s a good one .
monotype processing .
initially inked on a non @-@ absorbant--
what is it ?
the initials &quot; c @-@ h. &quot;
curtis hagen .
we &apos;re going after the dutchman again .
i want everything that you can dig up
on hagen since his release :
where he &apos;s staying , who he &apos;s associated with ,
what he is having for dinner .
i mean everything .
yeah , on my way .
i didn &apos;t think hagen would slip up so soon ,
but i guess he did .
yeah , but why use the same m.o.
that landed him prison in the first place ?
ah , it could be something he pulled out of storage
for a quick payday .
the information on the seller .
thanks .
&quot; douglas nemon . &quot;
obviously , an alias hagen &apos;s using .
no known residence , but we have a p.o. box ,
and we have a telephone number .
do you have any buyers lined up ?
several .
good .
the fbi is about to become one of them .
you have a plan ?
we clear the art as authentic ,
let the sale of the piece go through ,
and track the money back to hagen .
could work .
mr. rawling , grab whatever you need .
you &apos;re gonna come back to the bureau with me
so we can put this transaction in motion .
all right , we finished here ?
when i say we are .
look , i did my part .
why don &apos;t you wanna see this through ?
honestly ?
i don &apos;t like you looking at me as some kind of liability .
all i did was help you .
at a cost i &apos;m not comfortable with .
well , more comfortable than a prison cell .
watch it .
i did what you couldn &apos;t .
what ?
you heard me .
you took a system i believe in and corrupted it .
because that system didn &apos;t believe in you .
don &apos;t say another word . now , we are finished here .
go home .
mr. rawling , you ready ?
you bet .
let &apos;s go .
nice cigars .
you know , it &apos;s bad luck to celebrate
before a job is finished .
you like this ? nicaraguan imperiales .
great with scotch .
when this is over ,
you light up a stogie and release rebecca ?
just like that ?
i said i would .
and neal ?
he served his purpose .
&quot; a wise man does not waste
so good a commodity as lying for naught . &quot;
i &apos;m flattered you think me wise .
i was referring to neal .
when this is over , he &apos;s gonna make you pay ,
and you won &apos;t even know it &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m not that easily fooled .
i know more about you than you think .
well , i know a little about you too .
about me ?
yeah , good luck .
i think theodore winters would need the luck .
don &apos;t you ?
i know your name . do you know mine ?
moz , you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m okay for now .
so is rebecca .
what was the pressing matter ?
you &apos;re getting what you want .
how much longer do you need to keep her ?
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
it &apos;s a forgery investigation .
second @-@ rate hack trying to sell
a vermeer knock @-@ off to the met .
amateur hour .
let me talk to rebecca .
i swear , i didn &apos;t say anything to peter .
now , let me talk to her .
excuse me .
by all means , carry on .
hello ? yes . of course .
all right . keep working on the pages .
pretend you &apos;re explaining the process to me .
was it really a forgery case ?
yeah , except the artist was hagen .
what ?
he put a piece on the market .
they found his signature hidden in it .
why risk selling a fake now ?
i don &apos;t know , probably to raise capital .
he can &apos;t fund a treasure hunt on unemployment .
something isn &apos;t right .
yeah , starting with the timing .
and the signature ? he &apos;s smarter than that .
maybe this is all part of his plan .
i have no idea ,
but he can &apos;t know the fbi is after him .
yeah , he &apos;ll think you sold him out .
that &apos;s not good for rebecca .
well , you &apos;ll need ears and eyes
on the suit &apos;s investigation .
all taken care of .
you still have that earwig ?
that &apos;s a fast turnaround .
we &apos;ve had some very enthusiastic bidders .
what was the going price ?
950,000 .
that &apos;s good .
i assume you still have my account number .
once we finalize the paperwork ,
the money will be transferred to you .
thank you very much .
got nothing on the cell trace .
well , we still have the account .
let &apos;s have someone from tech
ready to engineer a false transaction .
mr. rawling , we &apos;re gonna need you
to give a statement to one of our agents .
it may take some time .
if you would .
how many more pages ?
two .
now one .
neal , if you &apos;d be so kind
as to apply the finishing touch .
why ?
ceremony .
and because i said so .
hagen may have his bases covered
when it comes to the phone ,
but we &apos;ll see how good he really is in a minute .
if this doesn &apos;t work ?
it &apos;ll work .
we might need caffrey after all .
i mean , we may have the tech ,
but he knows how someone like hagen thinks ,
what his next move could be .
i won &apos;t let hagen make another move .
jones , i thought about what you said ,
about how neal needs to take responsibility for himself .
yeah .
you &apos;re right .
i need to keep a distance .
so why did you take neal
to the auction house in the first place ?
that was a mistake .
listen , i wanted to ask you earlier .
what happens to neal when you leave ?
he &apos;s the next asac &apos;s problem .
you know , because i could ...
jones .
don &apos;t volunteer to take him on .
trust me . you &apos;ll regret it .
come on . let &apos;s see if our setup &apos;s ready .
something wrong ?
almost finished .
it &apos;s done .
this isn &apos;t like the other ones .
so i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s the pot of gold ?
let &apos;s see how we get there .
i &apos;ve never seen this language before .
neither have i.
that &apos;s why you &apos;re next task is going to be
to translate it for me .
that could take days , weeks , maybe .
rebecca doesn &apos;t have that time .
better get a move on .
we &apos;re not doing this .
you have any ideas ?
got something .
hang on .
this is a real time link to the ip activity
on hagen &apos;s account , courtesy of our friends downstairs .
money for the forgery was transferred two minutes ago .
strong signal this time .
doesn &apos;t look like there &apos;s any re @-@ routing .
i knew he wouldn &apos;t wanna wait .
he had to check on his money .
there &apos;s only one computer logging in to that account at the moment ,
and it &apos;s right here in new york .
已证实
we got him . downtown brooklyn .
assemble a team and move out .
the fbi &apos;s on the way .
never my favorite words .
if they grab hagen ,
i may never see her again , moz .
there &apos;s gotta be a play here .
i think i just found it .
all right , take a look at the pages ,
a good look .
rain man it .
i got it .
you got it ?
yeah .
good .
what are you doing ?
take one more step and i drop it .
you &apos;re bluffing .
you drop that light , and she &apos;s as good as gone .
yeah , so is the codex .
it &apos;s your choice : you release rebecca
or watch everything you work for go up in smoke .
what &apos;s gonna be ?
we need to talk about this .
you have five seconds to decide how important this message is .
we may have forgotten to mention
that the fbi is en route .
you are ...
a particular kind of bastard ?
yeah , i heard that one before .
three seconds .
two seconds .
stop .
one !
call whoever you need to call , and make it fast .
i want her out of there .
let her go .
put her on the line .
give her the phone .
rebecca ?
i &apos;m here , neal .
all right , listen to me . wherever you are , you run .
get to a populated area . you understand ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m going .
just keep moving and stay on the line , okay ?
okay .
all right .
satisfied ?
not quite .
here &apos;s a striking image for you .
back exit .
we can cut over to six , hit the bridge .
this time of day , we can be there 10 , 15 minutes tops .
nypd can get there faster .
already coordinated . we &apos;ll have their eyes .
but the arrest belongs to us .
i &apos;m not letting hagen get away
with another technicality .
so i &apos;m assuming you don &apos;t wanna tell caffrey .
he &apos;ll know when he needs to know .
in the meantime , have someone from the bureau pull his tracking data .
all right , you think he &apos;s up to something ?
told him to go home . wanna make sure he did .
rebecca , where are you ?
i think i &apos;m somewhere in brooklyn .
neal , we have to go now .
all right , hold on . you have it , right ?
every symbol safely stored here .
i am the codex now .
i need you to get a safe house ready .
we need a secure place to hole up
in case hagen comes after us .
and you ?
just call me when you &apos;re done .
all right , i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m still with you .
is anyone following you ?
i &apos;m not sure . maybe . i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not hanging up until i know you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;ll only feel safe when i &apos;m with you .
all right , what are your cross streets ?
what do you see ?
uh , kent and flushing ?
neal , i &apos;m scared .
i &apos;m on taylor right near the park .
i &apos;m coming to you .
i &apos;m passing hall street .
do you see anyone behind you ?
lots of people . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
all right , i &apos;m almost at flushing .
all right , i &apos;m turning toward you now .
i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m still here too .
thank god .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m still here .
you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah .
agent burke , is your team ready ?
yes , sir .
i &apos;ll take point .
let &apos;s move in .
that &apos;s a go .
fbi .
hands where i can see them .
agent burke .
we have so much to discuss .
are you sure it &apos;s safe to be here ?
it &apos;s only temporary .
moz is gonna find a safe place for you to stay
until this whole thing blows over .
rebecca , it &apos;s time to end this .
what ? you mean tell the fbi ?
yeah .
no . no way .
you &apos;ll get into trouble .
look , we started this together .
and now , you wanna finish it ?
tell me what you found .
well , all the pages held hidden symbols ,
symbols that added up to some kind of message ,
culminating with a picture of an idol .
describe the idol .
it was hindu , female .
did she have a crown ?
yeah .
what are you thinkin &apos; ?
is this what you saw ?
yes .
this is the idol of sita , deity of wealth .
it was created centuries ago .
i &apos;ve heard about it .
the idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds .
but over the years , the idol vanished .
and only one of the diamonds was ever recovered .
a stone which is now sitting in the smithsonian .
the hope diamond .
we &apos;re looking for its twin .
the other eye , the other diamond ,
it could be right here in new york .
yeah , hagen said the masons entrusted mosconi
with something of great value .
there &apos;s a lot of gap years in the history of the idol .
so it &apos;s possible the masons had it at some point .
that diamond is a good reason
for hagen to go to all this trouble .
it &apos;s a good reason for you
to decode those symbols you found .
where are the pages ?
the codex is gone .
to save you , i had to destroy it .
there &apos;s still a way we--
you have a safe house ?
what i have is bad news .
the fbi &apos;s got curtis hagen in custody .
how do you know ?
i heard it through the earwig .
if he tells peter there &apos;s footage of me taking those coins ,
it sets off a chain reaction that lands us all behind bars .
what are you gonna do ?
anything i can to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
what is it ?
i have to leave .
i &apos;ll be back . i promise .
be careful .
recognize this ?
william blake , if i &apos;m not mistaken .
judgment day . pretty fitting .
more like rush @-@ to @-@ judgment day .
the painting &apos;s a fake .
you &apos;ve no proof that it &apos;s mine .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
why would i do something that bold ?
well , i think that you got out of prison ,
had that piece ready to go ,
and decided to make some quick cash .
what , ride off into the sunset ? is that it ?
you tell me .
it &apos;s too rudimentary .
criminals aren &apos;t that complicated ,
and if i remember correctly ,
i caught you the first time because of your ego .
maybe prison humbled me .
i doubt it . people like you don &apos;t change .
heard we got hagen .
stay at your desk .
i didn &apos;t sign this painting .
you saying you were framed ?
say that was the case .
now , we have to think , who did it ?
had to be someone who knew me ,
had to be someone who knew
that i used to sign my work .
that &apos;d be anyone in this division .
someone in this division
who has an affinity for art forgery .
neal ?
you &apos;re lying .
what if i made you an offer ?
i &apos;ll take a confession .
there &apos;s something to show you ,
your eyes only , my place .
this conversation &apos;s over .
you can bring all the people you want ,
all the backup you need ,
but you &apos;re gonna want to keep this strictly between us .
peter . a moment ?
i checked caffrey &apos;s tracking data .
you &apos;re not gonna like it ,
especially when you look at the time stamp .
what is it ?
he was with hagen all afternoon .
peter--
save it .
we &apos;re all takin &apos; a ride .
this is as far as they go .
it &apos;s okay . i got it from here .
this better be worth my time .
it &apos;s worth more than that .
really ? what &apos;s that ?
freedom , agent burke .
all right , stop .
look , this could be a setup . we don &apos;t know what &apos;s in there .
i do , evidence .
how can you be sure ?
i love watching the two of you dance .
a bit cathartic , really .
shut up .
by the way , you &apos;re going to prison again .
i doubt that .
keep dreaming .
i have been dreaming of payback ,
for the two of you taking away years of my life .
you did that to yourself .
now , i &apos;m doing it to you .
beg .
what ?
beg me for your freedom .
shots fired !
everybody get down ! get down !
all agents , subject down !
call medics and swat !
close off immediate area now !
hagen .
hagen .
you were at that building with him .
think i wouldn &apos;t check your anklet ?
what were you doing , neal ?
i was working with hagen .
peter , listen to me . he was threatening rebecca .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
then you should &apos;ve told me .
i couldn &apos;t take that risk .
what sort of work was it ?
some kind of puzzle he wanted me to solve .
look , i &apos;ll explain everything later .
what &apos;s important is that rebecca is safe now .
why did hagen bring me here ?
like i said , it could &apos;ve been a setup .
&quot; beg me for your freedom ? &quot; what did that mean ?
look , that could mean anything .
he could &apos;ve been setting me up .
i mean , you heard him . he wanted revenge .
who did this ? and i swear , if you hold back--
i have no idea who would &apos;ve taken him out .
hagen &apos;s place has been tossed .
someone did a pretty
thorough sweep of the apartment , and recently .
have the team go through it with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
all right .
can i see that ?
no , personal effects that were on the victim
my handler &apos;s right over there .
i &apos;m not gonna try anything . please .
thanks .
i &apos;ll be right back .
call the building manager . check hagen &apos;s mail .
i want something .
you got it .
don &apos;t think i &apos;m finished with you .
i found this in hagen &apos;s wallet .
&quot; blue ground cafe . &quot; it &apos;s a coffee shop .
&quot; 8154 linden avenue . &quot;
that &apos;s the same block where we found siegel &apos;s body .
uh @-@ huh . check out the back .
hagen was watching someone all day and taking notes .
could be anybody .
could be whoever shot him .
barista remembered hagen .
not much else .
all right , hagen sat right here all day .
he was looking at something .
that building across the street ?
people moving in and out .
good vantage point if you &apos;re watching someone .
noting when they enter ...
and when they exit .
i &apos;ll need to contact the super
to get a list of all residents in the past six months .
or just check the directory .
neal , who &apos;s listed in apartment three ?
no one . it &apos;s blank .
that might explain the question mark .
siegel was here , and so was hagen .
they we &apos;re looking into the same person .
let &apos;s see who lives in number three .
i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s home .
wait .
electronic trip wire .
careful .
what is all this ?
neal , this is professional reconnaissance work .
this is all my movements over the past year ,
perfectly catalogued .
a map of your radius .
someone has been studying you .
not just me .
this is everyone who &apos;s in my division .
the entire team .
neal ?
whoever murdered siegel also framed hagen .
probably killed him as well .
this was practice .
this is rebecca &apos;s apartment .
who is she , neal ?
neal ?
neal ?
