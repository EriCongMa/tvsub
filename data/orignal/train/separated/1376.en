Wait! I'm here! I'm here!
This is me! I'll move it!
I already started the ticket.
Please? I'm so broke.
I worked till 2 A.M. There was nowhere to park.
Yeah, I don't make the rules, so...
Come on, don't be a jerk.
The hell is this?
8 A.M. street cleaning.
You didn't make it.
Great. Thanks for nothing.
I hope you have a horrible day.
Oh, my God.
Call 9-1-1!
Why? Am I under arrest?
Somebody help!
You know what? Screw y...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Okay, so which musketeer are you?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. I'm looking for Maura Isles.
This is the epee section.
Dr. Isles is in the sabre section.
It's a whole different sword.
Thank you.
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi. What do you think of the club?
Well, I didn't know that rich people had their own Storm Troopers.
It is popular across all classes.
You know, fencing is defined
as the art of using the sword scientifically.
It's been around since the 12th century.
The only fencing I ever heard about
when I was little, involved stereos,
two guys named Luigi, and a getaway car.
Well, this kind won't get me arrested,
but it will help my brain build new neural pathways.
Is that what this is about?
You gonna fence your way out of your brain condition?
I'm just trying a variety of activities.
Learning new skills helps the brain create new connections
that can compensate for damaged ones.
So do you really think that this could help you?
Well, it could.
If it doesn't, then at least it's gonna give me good abs.
Wanna give it a try?
Oh, no.
I'm more of an epee girl.
It's a whole different sword.
Oh, do you mind?
Yeah, yeah.
Sir Maura Isles' phone.
Yeah, it's Rizzoli.
Okay. Uh, we'll be there in about 10 minutes.
Okay.
Do you have something to change into?
Well, what's wrong with this?
I've worn sporty outfits to the crime scene before.
It's a full-body thong.
Modern day chastity belt?
Where you gonna put that?
I don't wanna know.
Tae kwon do, archery, watercolor,
and next week, I start the piccolo.
Sounds like the worst summer camp ever.
Well, do you have other suggestions?
Ice hockey.
Yeah, because we're short a player against Boston Fire next week.
Oh, hockey would be beneficial to my balance and coordination.
But isn't that the sport where people lose teeth?
Not if you're good at it.
Well, you know what?
You get me the right mouth guard, and I'm in.
I'll try anything once.
Really? I'm gonna hold you to that.
I mean, I don't know if you're gonna have fun,
but I know I am.
Jack McCarty. 43.
Mailman, apparently.
9-millimeter in the front seat.
Yeah. Looks like he shot himself in the mouth.
Well, the bullet lodged itself in the posterior skull
at an angle consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot.
When did it happen?
I'd say lividity puts time of death at six to eight hours.
Shot Spotter register anything about that time?
No. Closed doors would've muffled the sound.
He leave a note?
Only lives a couple blocks from here, according to his license.
Maybe he left one there, drove over here.
For what? The view?
Well, the victim has a chip in his second bicuspid.
I'll need to check the dental records
to see if it was preexisting or not.
Damn.
Yeah. Guess we're rootin' for this one not to be a suicide.
Wishing for murder. That's a first.
Thanks, Nina.
10 months ago, Jack's wife filed for divorce.
She and the kids moved up to Andover.
So the wife doesn't live here?
Who left the door open?
Freeze!
Boston Police! Put it down!
Federal agent. Drop your weapon.
What agency?
I'm a U.S. Postal Inspector.
Let me see some ID.
I got a badge.
My ID's in the purse in the other room.
Don't you judge me.
So you did all of this, not an intruder?
I was looking for evidence. What are you guys doing here?
Why don't you just stick to answering our questions for now?
I'm investigating an illegal operation
in one of my postal facilities.
Jack was supposed to meet me last night with proof,
but he never showed.
What kind of illegal operation?
Oh, it's big. There's a lot to it.
You might wanna sit down.
I'm good.
I meant the Silver Fox.
There's a chair over there if you get tired.
I'm good.
Okay.
A month ago, a janitor in my Roxbury post office came to see me.
He said he saw Jack stealing packages.
So he confronts Jack, Jack threatens his life,
the janitor gets scared, leaves town.
Two days later, he turned up dead.
You think Jack killed the janitor?
At first, but Jack has an alibi.
I just think the janitor stuck his nose where it didn't belong,
and whatever's in those packages is worth killing over.
Which is what?
Which is what what?
Which... what...
What's in the packages?
I don't know.
Illegal contraband. Jewels or drugs.
We had a case last year that involved rare pheasants.
I didn't know pheasants could be rare.
Oh, they can be very rare. You'd be surprised how rare...
Okay, can we focus, please?
If Jack was into something illegal,
then why did he wanna meet with you?
Because when Jack heard that...
that the janitor was murdered,he got scared.
So I offered to protect him in exchange for the proof.
You know, I didn't check this...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You can't go in there.
And there it is.
The condescending detective tone.
You think I'm a lesser species, right?
Just a lowly mail cop
that gets to play in America's awesome stamp collection?
Huh? You think you're the only one
that gets to play with the twin dragons?
We need to secure the area.
I am a federal agent of the United States of America,
Detective Rizzoli.
And I... respect that,
Agent Prescott.
This is a potential crime scene.
Jack is dead.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
Well, I was just hoping he got scared off.
We found his body this morning.
H-how'd he die?
Well, it's still under investigation.
There's one thing I know for sure...
Jack McCarty was murdered.
Hey, Kiki! What a nice surprise.
Would you mind giving these to Vince? It's our tax documents.
You know, because we file jointly now.
Being in love... it's the only time taxes could seem romantic.
Oh, yes, please. To go, if you don't mind.
I have an appointment with my hairdresser,
and the last time I was late, she punished me with bangs.
I remember being a newlywed.
Yeah?
All the sweet kisses for nothing.
All the silly jokes only the both of you can understand.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was a long time ago.
I don't know why every employee thinks
they need to dump their stuff back here.
I mean... what is this now?
A blender? I already have a blender back here.
Um... I think that might be my birthday gift from Vince.
What?
Yeah. He was probably hiding it back there.
Oh. You wanted a blender?
Well, I mean, we could use one, which I may have mentioned.
Oh. Well... you know.
That's a good symbol.
I mean, you're blending your lives together.
You can make soul smoothies.
That's good. That's good.
Yeah, it'll be... it'll be useful.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Right.
Sure.
Well, anyway, I gotta go. Thanks for the coffee.
Okay. Watch the bangs.
I...I mean,
he is the most unromantic jerk I ever met.
Vince Korsak... A blender.
I had no idea postal inspectors carried guns.
Yeah. They have the same training we do.
But their cases are about mail.
Well, Dad was a plumber. His cases were about toilets.
Yeah, but he wasn't armed.
True.
Do people really mail birds?
Pheasants, apparently.
Everything about this guy's life points to suicide.
Credit cards and bank statements.
Yeah, he was in serious debt.
His car was about to be repo'ed.
Well, so what? So he gets involved in a mail-stealing scheme
to solve his money problems?
All right, thank you.
That was CJ's boss.
Her murdered janitor?
Died in a slip and fall while visiting his sister in New York.
It was an accident?
According to the New York M.E., it was.
Wasn't even an open case.
CJ was told to leave it alone weeks ago.
Boss said she's a loose cannon. He sent her to anger management.
Wait. Didn't she almost take a swing at Jane?
Well, yeah, but that's because she didn't wanna hit the Silver Fox.
Yeah.
Okay, so both she and her theory are wacked...
which points us back to suicide.
I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know... I've learned to live without
Here's Jack McCarty's dental records.
Thank you.
Look at you.
Shaking the babaloo, are we?
Well, the association between work and Mozart
is a well-worn neural pathway in my brain,
and I am forcing a new electrochemical pattern to fire.
Interesting.
There's been a lot of excellent results
in neural retraining in stroke victims.
Oh, yes, and all kinds of limbic impairment.
And is there much research
using this technique for Chiari Malformations?
Just me, as far as I know.
And are you considering any other treatment options?
Well, if my symptoms worsen, I will think about surgery.
Okay.
So in the meantime, Motown.
Are you doubting my methods?
No, on the contrary.
Stevie Wonder practically got me through university.
For me, it was always Aretha.
Yeah, we sing together in the shower every morning.
Which song?
Only the best one... "Natural Woman."
You know, I always wondered, what exactly is a...
A "Natural woman"?
Mm. You just gotta feel it, Kent.
Right here.
Would you mind filing these?
Sure.
I shall file them like the natural man that I am.
Are you neural retraining or Kent retraining?
Both.
So Jack McCarty's medical chart.
Moderately high cholesterol,
allergies to sulfa, walnuts, and peanuts,
but otherwise, a healthy 46-year-old male.
I got his dental records,
and his last exam two months ago shows no chip.
Interesting, but not conclusive.
That's what I said until I found...
a hematoma on the roof of his mouth.
Now that would take a lot of force to cause.
Same amount of force it would cause the chip?
Here's the bullet.
Rub markings, like it came out of a silencer.
And there's one more thing.
These markings suggest
that he may have been restrained.
From what? Like a seat belt?
Well, that would be consistent with the width of the contusions.
So he was immobilized from behind,
and the gun was shoved in his mouth.
He was murdered. CJ was right.
See how long they last without me.
Anger issues, my ass!
Loose cannon?! Oh, I got your loose cannon!
All my life I had to fight for every doggone thing I get...
Your mother's calling me.
Well, don't answer it. Call her back later.
We're about to have our hands full.
I...
Oh, hell, no.
Can... Can we just talk?
Just fair warning, I'm really in a mood to punch somebody.
That little call to my boss ratting me out
got me suspended.
Not my intention.
Oh! Should I put that on my unemployment application?
Might be a good idea.
Excuse me?!
Don't think I'm afraid to punch a fellow hottie.
All right, I just meant that now you have the time
to work the case with us.
You believe me?
We do.
So what do you say we work together?
Okay.
There was nothing unusual in Jack's car?
Or his house.
Is there anyplace else we can look,
anyplace that he would've hidden
whatever proof he was bringing you?
Did you check with his ex-wife?
Yes. She hasn't seen him in over a week.
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to make Jack's death look like a suicide.
They could've done the same thing with the janitor,
made it look like an accident.
Ah, then why go through all the trouble of the cover-ups?
'Cause whatever's in those packages is valuable enough
they don't wanna leave a trail behind.
The post office does seize over $30 million
in drugs and jewels every year.
Ah, don't forget the pheasants.
Do you have a problem with pheasants?
No. I... Like all birds.
I think what Frankie meant to ask is,
why would these criminals risk such value in the mail?
In theory, they could get lost along the way.
Because they don't get lost.
"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night
"stays these couriers from the swift completion
of their appointed rounds."
That's the... The Post Office creed, right?
Stop trying to kiss my ass.
Okay, uh, what about the post office itself?
Do the employees have changing rooms?
Or their own mailboxes?
Well, I did go to Jack's branch during my initial investigation.
They have lockers, but I couldn't check 'em
'cause I couldn't get a warrant.
Well, warrants-are-us.
CSRU finished the car.
We found the missing piece of tooth and a hair,
so let's fast-track the DNA.
Do you wanna continue with the neural retraining as we work?
I was thinking about a little bit of Gladys Knight.
You okay?
Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry. I think I just... I didn't drink enough water today.
Thank you.
I don't think hydration is the problem here, Maura.
I had a look over the reports that you asked me to file.
There was an error in the fisk autopsy.
What kind of error?
You spelled...
You spelled "Myelomeningocele" wrong.
Really? Myelomeningocele?
It's a protrusion or growth on the spine.
I remember learning the term.
First year medical school, "Gray's Anatomy."
M-y-l-i...
M...
M-y...
No, it's an... E.
It's M-y...
Maura...
I just have to say
the surgical options have shown some great results.
Hey, Maura, you're friendly with
the chief M.E. of New York City, right?
Yes, I am. Uh, Dr. Lutz.
We need an autopsy report
went through his office about a month ago.
The name?
Bob Rasmussen.
Janitor.
We have reason to believe that someone staged his murder
to look like an accident.
Well, I can't imagine Dr. Lutz making a mistake,
but if he did, I am sure that he would want to know about it
and do absolutely everything he can to correct it.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, everyone thinks of us as "Snail mail,"
but we sort 30,000 pieces of mail a an hour
and deliver 209 million pieces of mail
to 150 million different addresses a year.
You guys know any snails that can do that?
Can't say I do.
Um, where on the floor did Jack work?
He separated the mail into the bins you see here.
Each bin represents the route of a different carrier.
What were his relationships like here?
Anyone he didn't get along with?
Not really. He was a great guy.
Tough time after the divorce.
I wish we would've done more to help him.
Here we are. Locker 125.
Standard stuff.
Clothes,
water bottle, granola bar.
Okay. We'll take it to the lab and have it swept.
Thank you very much for your help.
Of course.
Hey, c-can I ask, uh, why you're looking through Jack's stuff?
I... thought he committed suicide.
No, BPD investigates all suicides.
Just part of the job.
Thanks.
Sure.
I wonder why Benjamin Franklin agreed to be
the first Postmaster General.
Are you kidding?
He got to "Frank" all his letters, for one thing.
"Frank"?
Send them for free. No stamps needed.
Although technically, stamps didn't exist back then, so...
Well, prior to 1847, dates, rates, and a letter's origin
were all handwritten.
Yeah, I'm a bit of a philatelist myself.
A philatelist?
Sounds dirty.
It means I collect stamps.
No. No way to make that dirty.
You know, I'm a member of the APS.
The American Philatelist Society?
You should come to the convention next summer.
Oh, no, I-I mean, I couldn't. I'm... I'm only amateur.
Maura, come on now. Don't be bashful.
You said that you wanted to try new things.
June. Poughkeepsie. It'll be wild.
Really?
Okay. Okay! How fun!
Well, let's talk more convention after I use the ladies' room.
All right.
Hi! Have a seat.
Hi. Oh. CJ.
Uh, you know, I think we're just gonna grab a seat at the bar.
It's my, uh, my RBF, right?
My Resting Bitch Face that scares people away?
No. I assure you, they're used to mine. It...
Maybe you just... just wanna try a little less intensity.
I'm not intense!
I have passion.
And passion is what got you into anger management?
Well, sometimes passion makes you wanna punch people.
Mm. God, don't I know it.
No! Maybe it's about learning...
how to work with people.
You know, as opposed to wanting to punch them.
Mmm. I know somebody I'd like to work with.
Hot bunz at 3 o'clock.
Really?
Yeah. I have a type.
It's the khakis.
In the khakis? Really?
Khakis, yes. Are you judging me?
No, I...
Okay.
I would never... You know what I mean?
The X-rays from the janitor's autopsy report.
See here? The tiny bone fragment in the cervical canal?
It chipped off of C2 up here in the cervical spine.
The only way that could occur is from a rotational break.
Dr. Lutz was mortified that he missed it.
So he didn't die from falling down the stairs?
No. His neck was snapped, likely from behind.
Same M.O. as our victim.
Somebody followed him to New York to kill him.
They really didn't want any loose ends.
What the hell were these guys into?
Is this the stuff from the gym bag?
Uh, yes. I haven't processed it all yet.
But Kent didn't find any prints other than the victim's.
Didn't his medical records say that he had a peanut allergy?
Yes, it did.
Well, then why has he got a peanut butter granola bar?
I mean... that can't be good for him, right?
It's a postal barcode.
Why did he hide it there?
Maybe it was the only way
he could get it out without anyone noticing.
Jack McCarty died for this?
Well, I'm guessing that whatever that barcode was attached to
was not a box of pheasants.
These 65 bars represent a USPS Intelligent Mail barcode.
Or what we in the biz call the 4CB.
It was introduced in 2013 to provide more information
than its predecessor, POSTNET.
You do your homework, girl!
What does it tell us about our package?
Well, these bars represent the ZIP plus four.
And is that the closest
that we can get to a final destination?
Well, it can get you down to a specific postal delivery route.
There are hundreds of packages on each route.
Too many to search.
So if we can't get a destination,
can this barcode help us find its origin?
Yes. The middle bars can tell us the sender's Mailer ID.
This translates to Mailer ID 43135,
and that belongs to...
South Paw Sporting Goods in Miami.
A sporting goods store?
What are they mailing, rare snakeskin baseball gloves?
That look funny to you?
Yeah, it looks under-inked.
Forged?
Yeah, it could be.
The Post Office uses technologically advanced printers.
But it looks like this barcode was printed on
an old-school dot matrix printer.
Have you ever considered a job at the post office?
No.
Is there a way to tell where the package is actually from?
Or more importantly, where it was going?
Yeah, the post office has
this cool Mail Isolation and Tracking Program.
It takes pictures of every piece of mail at its origin point.
So if Miami has pictures of the package
that's attached to this barcode,
we can see who was supposed to receive it.
Yes.
How to get ahold of it, though? Tough to get a warrant.
Well, I may be suspended, but I still have friends.
Let me just make a call.
I just want the best for you, girl.
That's the only reason I said that.
Your gift stinks.
That's why you've been calling me?
Yes.
Look, the... the... this blender is battery-powered.
You gave your first wife sneakers for a wedding present.
She played basketball.
You gave a roof rake to your second wife?
She stills uses it on my house.
Exactly. That's why none of those marriages worked out.
Vince...
Maybe it's time you leaned towards your more romantic side.
And that's what makes it last.
Kiki mentioned when we were at the mall last week
that we needed a blender.
I mentioned last week that I needed a mammogram.
You wanna make an appointment at the doctor for my birthday?
Vince.
Giving a gift is just another chance to remind our loved ones
how we feel about them.
What's the damn blender say to Kiki?
How we doing?
Call worked. We're about to get the photo of our package.
Really? You're not gonna give up your chair for an elder?
What?
Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Okay, CJ, enough. I'm not an elder.
I'm not a Silver Fox. Got it?
I'm sorry. You just remind me of a mentor I used to have.
Greatest thing in the world was when he told me,
"You did good work."
The nickname was out of respect.
Okay, well, then... thank you.
There it is.
800 North Pope Street.
Yeah, but Pope Street only runs south.
The address is a fake, or it's a mistake.
Nina, can you see how many other packages
were sent to that address?
Here we go.
There must be a hundred or more.
So the address wasn't a mistake.
What happens to mail that's undeliverable?
Well, it goes to a dead letter bin in each post office,
then its usually shipped to the dead letter office in Atlanta.
But I'm guessing these were intercepted
before they were rerouted to Atlanta.
That was our victim's job.
Well, it's a smart plan.
This way, you can't trace the sender or receiver.
They both have plausible deniability.
Nina, can you find when the next package is supposed to arrive
at the Pope Street address?
DNA reports on the hair.
Oh. Thank you.
This is a list of neurosurgeons.
Yes.
Ones who specialize in Chiari Malformations.
I didn't ask you to do this.
No. And I knew you'd be upset if I told you that I was doing it.
The top guy for posterior fossa compressions
is Dr. Richards at Mass General.
And Dr. Lambeau at Brigham and Women's
specializes in spinal laminectomy...
Kent, stop.
This isn't part of your job,
which I what I believe you should be doing right now.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I was only trying to help.
I've processed all the data on the 800 North Pope packages.
Looks like they always land in the post office
every Tuesday and Thursday.
Today's Thursday.
I called Miami to confirm. Another one's definitely coming.
With Jack dead, somebody else must
be picking up those packages from the dead letter bin.
We need to get eyes in that post office
and get that package.
Well, how do we do that
without alerting whoever's picking it up?
Go undercover.
Well, janitorial staff is contracted
outside of the post office.
That's really the only way we can do it
without setting off alarm bells.
I've already been seen in the post office.
Me, too.
Me, too.
You and me, Foxy.
Yeah. Foxy.
All clear so far.
This is my turf.
I wish I could be in there, you know, and take 'em out.
Okay, let's try to remember our conversation
about working with people.
Korsak, incoming.
Not our fish.
Don't like the way you use your tone.
It's not what you say, it's the way you say it.
It's not about tone.
It's your tone, your tone.
It's the raspiness, and it's a lower register,
and it makes me feel very uncomfortable.
I understand why you've been fired now.
Manager making his rounds.
Nope. He's our man.
Police. What do you have there?
Shit.
Not so fast.
Hi, Kiki.
I thought I wasn't gonna see you before your party.
Well, you know, I was just picking up some tax stuff.
Vince said he left it back here.
Okay. Kiki, the way I see it, you have two choices.
Choice number one,
you tell Vince you don't want the blender.
Yeah, I know, but I just... I don't wanna hurt his feelings.
此处是在模仿落后选手最后陈述自己为何该重获机会继续比赛
Okay, so then go to option two... "The Face."
I've been doing it for 30 years.
The what?
Observe.
Oh, Frank.
For our 20th anniversary, after I bore you three children,
you gave me the same box of caramels
you've always given me.
Oh, honey, thank you so much.
Works like a charm.
Hmm, except you and Frank are divorced.
Yes, because I stopped doing "The Face."
He went looking for it elsewhere.
All right, come on. You try it.
Try it!
Okay.
Thank you! I love it!
L-less eyebrow.
Thank you. I love it.
Did you get the DNA back on that hair?
Because I think that we've got our man upstairs.
Well, I'm not so sure that you have your man,
because the DNA says that your man is a woman.
What? Is this the file?
No, uh, that's not the right one.
What is it?
It's a list of neurosurgeons that specialize in...
surgical treatments for Chiari Malformations.
I thought you were feeling better.
What about the whole... neural highway thing?
In time, it can be effective.
The truth is, I think I've just been using it
to avoid the surgery.
It's okay to be scared, Maura.
It's not the surgery that scares me.
I just...
I guess I'm just afraid
of what will happen if it doesn't work.
You know, Jane, I have always been...
The smartest person in the room?
I wasn't gonna say that.
I said it.
What if I'm not me anymore?
Okay. Listen to me.
Okay, you are always gonna be you. Okay?
Your intelligence is not what defines you.
You are kind and generous and loving,
and you are the best friend that a person could ever ask for.
Okay, that woman is always gonna be there,
whether the surgery works or not.
Thank you.
Your brain is not what I love about you, Maura.
What I love about you
is that you took my mother in, and now I don't have to.
I love that about you.
Deeply.
Actually, it's not very smart that you did that.
Maybe it's... mm, advanced.
Okay, fine. I will make the appointment.
Okay.
Just keep my mother.
I'm looking inside your soul.
500 tabs of oxy at 60 bucks a pop. That's...
30 grand a package.
Derek, you know that mailing drugs is a federal crime.
You're going away for a long time.
Or you can tell us who you're working for.
I don't know what you mean.
You're looking at a minimum of 10 years.
Why would you cover for these people?
'Cause it's better than a bullet to the brain.
Please. You'll never make it out of lockup.
When your business partners find out
that we have you here,
there's gonna be a shiv with your name on it.
Okay.
Derek, you don't have as much as a traffic ticket.
You took your sister and her family in
after she lost her job.
You coach T-ball on the weekends.
How did you get mixed up in this?
My guess is you got trapped.
I had a car accident about...
six years ago.
I messed up my back really bad.
I got addicted to oxy.
When my script ran out, I found a dealer.
And about a year ago,
the dealer threatened to cut me off
unless I got the packages through.
How was Jack McCarty involved?
It was only supposed to be a couple of times.
But the packages kept coming.
I needed help.
And you knew that Jack needed the money.
I swear, I had... had nothing to do with his death.
Do you need to be somewhere?
The drop's tonight, isn't it?
If I don't show, I'm a dead man.
Derek, we can protect you,
but we need to know who your dealer is.
What's her name?
Rachel Hanson.
What time are you supposed to meet her?
9.
Okay.
Okay, our guy's in place.
Almost 9:00. Any minute now.
Frankie, you all set?
Roger that.
Got a car pulling up.
It's a woman. Description matches.
Bingo.
Once she passes the mailbox across the street,
leave the duffel on the bench
and walk away.
I'll make the drop.
Nobody move until she's got possession of that bag.
She won't take the duffel bag until the car's out of sight.
She's got it. I'm going in.
Police! Freeze!
Look at that.
You finally got to punch somebody.
Yeah. It hurts more than you'd think.
It does. Good job, CJ.
Thank you.
I may be getting old.
Right now retirement sounds sweet.
When you leave, CJ may snatch you up.
Yes, sir, meet at the airport.
My boss found an oxy smuggling ring in New York,
and he wants me on a plane to help consult.
You got reinstated. That's great!
I just don't know how I get over
two men dying on my watch.
Mm, you don't.
But there's still a lot of people out there we can help.
You're all right, Rizzoli.
You, too.
Bye, Foxy.
I'd like to say I'm sorry to see her go, but...
You're tired.
I like her, but... whoa! She's exhausting.
Don't you think?
Thanks for being here, everybody.
Oh, we're just here for the cake.
That's true.
W... Yeah, Ma, I want a... I want a big one with a lot of icing.
Me, too.
Oh, me, three. Here we go.
Okay. Ah! Ah! Ah!
The birthday girl gets the first piece.
All right.
The birthday girl also gets a present.
Is there a face for this?
I don't know.
'Cause we make beautiful music together.
I love it.
Give it a shake.
Okay.
What is this?
It's your birthstone surrounded by my birthstone,
to remind you that I'll always be there for you
no matter what.
Vince, that's so romantic. Thank you.
You didn't think I'd really get you a tambourine, did you?
Yes.
Testing. Testing, 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3, testing.
Oh. The new karaoke machine.
Anybody wanna give it a whirl?
Okay, everybody, I'd like to give you all a little treat.
This is a Scottish classic
called "Donald, Where's Your Troosers?"
Somebody get up there, quick!
No! No, don't do it!
No!
Really?
Why?
Well, um, someone has been wanting...
...to try new things.
Ah, no, Jane. I do not sing in public.
Don't be shy now.
I hear you singing in the house all the time, Maura.
Yeah. Come on, you said you'd try anything once. Once.
Come on!
It's once!
Come on!
Maura! Maura! Maura! Maura!
Maura! Maura! Maura! Maura!
Really? Really, Jane? Come on.
Maura! Maura! Ah!
Okay, okay, okay!
Maura!
Go, girl!
I guess I'll just have to save mine for the finale then, eh?
Oh, I know just the song for you.
I'm really not good at this.
Here.
*Looking out in the morning rain*
Um, can you help? Quickly. Faster.
Okay.
Faster. Faster.
*I used to feel *
*So uninspired*
*And when I knew I had to face another day*
Oh, thank goodness for Nina.
*Lord, it made me feel so tired*
*Before the day I met you, life was so...*
*Unkind*
*But you're the key to my peace of mind*
*'Cause you make me feel*
*You make me feel*
*You make me feel like a natural woman*
*Oh, baby, what you've done to me?*
*Done to me*
*You make me feel so good inside*
*Good inside*
*And I just want to be*
*Want to be*
*Close to you*
*You make me feel so alive*
*You make me feel, you make me feel*
*Like a natural woman*
