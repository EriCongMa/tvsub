i @-@ i &apos;m headed to class .
i smell alcohol on your breath .
have you been drinking ?
no .
you have a cold ?
i did . um ...
but i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m getting over it .
did you know certain
cold medications can impact your faculties ?
uh , yes , i ... but i &apos;m fine . seriously .
then you wouldn &apos;t mind if i administer a breathalyzer ?
no .
good .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t have one in the car .
would you mind accompanying me to the station ?
lockhart / gardner .
i &apos;m sorry , who would you like ?
alicia florrick . hold on , please .
be right back .
yes !
it &apos;s excellent news .
welcome back , diane .
her first order of business
will be this malpractice suit ...
one second .
you wanted me to tell you
when any clients called for alicia or cary .
yes . who is it ?
jeffrey grant .
oh , grant real estate . mid @-@ level client .
his dad was arrested two months ago for assault .
alicia handled it .
we don &apos;t want to lose them to alicia &apos;s firm .
got it .
hello , jeffrey .
this is will gardner . how &apos;s your dad ?
uh , he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s good .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s at home .
who is this ?
will gardner , alicia &apos;s boss .
alicia no longer works at the firm .
but can you tell me your issue ?
i &apos;d love to see what i can do .
well , yeah . i don &apos;t know , something &apos;s weird here . i got ...
pulled over for i guess speeding .
and they say i &apos;ve been drinking , but i haven &apos;t .
do you have alicia &apos;s number ?
i don &apos;t , actually . where are you now ?
it &apos;s the 29th district .
i &apos;ve been waiting for a breathalyzer ,
but it &apos;s been , like , an hour .
i bring in more capital into this firm ...
why don &apos;t i come on down there and see what i can do .
both of you , please !
of course you don &apos;t have malpractice suits in tax law .
who gives a damn about tax law ?
okay , stop it .
listen to me , all of you .
there are no more fights at this firm .
no more internal squabbles .
we work together . now , this malpractice suit
is an irritant , but it can &apos;t slow us down
unless we let it slow us down , do you understand ?
move together , act together , or leave .
that &apos;s all i want : to act together .
diane , you take it .
where are you going ?
out to stop a client from leaving .
so , insurance has reviewed
the $ 6 million lawsuit against us
and denied coverage due to &quot; attorney recklessness . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t reckless .
it was a failed adoption .
emotions run high in adoptions .
this was the gopniks ?
yes , they adopted a two @-@ month @-@ old girl ,
but the genetic parents fought to get her back .
i told them that it was unlikely we would win .
they &apos;re disgruntled . they &apos;re lashing out . seen it before .
who was the associate supervisor ?
i don &apos;t know . i was on the zander divorce .
i put it into the rotation .
well , the depositions start tomorrow ,
and we have to prep someone ,
so which associate signed off on it ?
want to guess ?
we &apos;re in financial trouble .
we didn &apos;t get our bonuses .
oh , come on , anthony , would you stop with the bonus talk ?
what if we lower our sights on office space ?
look further south .
the problem is the length of the lease .
we don &apos;t want to get trapped in someplace too downscale .
and chumhum ?
we won &apos;t see their retainer money for another 45 days .
we won &apos;t see it at all if they realize
what a shoestring we &apos;re running ...
oh , come ... they knew they were moving their business
were you chatting on mom &apos;s computer earlier ?
what ? can you knock ?
were you using mom &apos;s computer ?
no . why ?
her webcam was on .
okay , look , we all knew this would be hard .
every new firm has ...
their struggles .
stern @-@ lockhart started in an airport hotel room .
so hold it together .
what we &apos;re going through now will make our firm stronger .
alicia florrick ?
yep .
subpoena or restraining order ?
subpoena . you guys should get an office .
it &apos;s hard to find you .
we &apos;ll get right on that .
lockhart / gardner ?
are we being sued ?
because i &apos;m thinking we should countersue ,
stop playing defense .
no .
they &apos;re being sued .
what ?
then why are you being served ?
i &apos;m a witness .
you must be jeffrey ?
mr. gardner ?
uh , will &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late . you doing some homework ?
italian .
have they tested you yet ?
no . i saw the patrolman go by here a minute ago .
there he is .
okay .
now , you just sit tight .
jeffrey , what did the patrolman say when he stopped you ?
what did he say ?
he said ... he smelled alcohol on my breath .
but he saw i had cold medicine .
he said that must be it . why ?
nothing . there &apos;s an asa over there talking with him .
yeah , she was in the patrol car .
she was in the patrol car ?
yes .
and you haven &apos;t gotten a breathalyzer yet ?
no .
and they took a ... cotton swab from inside my mouth .
what ... they ... why ?
they didn &apos;t say .
should i be worried ?
not yet .
have you had any other brushes with the law , jeffrey ?
i had some issues when i was in high school .
i got pulled over on another dui , but ...
i would never drink and drive again .
okay . don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be right back .
geneva , what &apos;s going on here ?
what do you mean ?
what i mean is , why is an asa
out stopping a college student on a phony dui ?
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re calling it phony .
well , an hour after the pull @-@ over ,
and still no breathalyzer , no blood test ?
every time he pees , your case is literally going down the toilet .
but you swabbed for dna , which is irrelevant to sobriety .
we were just trying to be diligent , will .
ah . that &apos;s what it &apos;s called ?
well , i &apos;m taking my client home , okay ?
and i want you to discard that dna .
have a good day .
actually , no .
your client is under arrest for driving under the influence ,
and given his previous arrests ,
we were with our rights to collect his dna .
you &apos;re opening yourself up to a suit .
i breathe in the morning , i &apos;m opening myself up to a suit .
okay , they &apos;ve arrested you ,
but clearly , they &apos;re after something else .
they arrested me ? why ?
i don &apos;t know , but ...
i need you to breathe into this .
your honor , the blood alcohol limit
for inebriation in illinois is 0.08 % .
according to this pocket breathalyzer ,
my client &apos;s blood alcohol concentration
was 0.00001 .
that &apos;s a whole lot of zeroes , mrs. asa .
sounds to me like you pulled over the wrong kid .
my apologies , your honor .
the state is prepared to dismiss the charge .
it was our mistake . we apologize to mr. grant .
if the state is dropping the arrest ,
we ask that the dna swab collected from my client be destroyed , too .
we &apos;d love to , your honor ,
but we &apos;re rearresting mr. grant on a murder charge .
what ?
we &apos;re arresting mr. grant
for the murder of dani littlejohn ,
a college student who was found outside her dorm
on the chicago polytech campus last august
with blunt trauma to her skull .
that &apos;s quite a step up from a dui .
it is .
and as you can see from this report ,
miss littlejohn struggled with her killer ,
whose dna was found under her fingernails .
your honor ... hold on , counselor .
here , take a look at this .
we had no match for this dna evidence
until two months ago , when his father was arrested for assault .
as part of the father &apos;s standard processing ,
his dna was taken and entered
into the statewide database , where we got a hit--
a familial match for dani littlejohn &apos;s killer .
a familial match .
so the killer could be anybody in that kid &apos;s family .
yes , any male in his family--
but jeffrey grant is the only one
at the same school as miss littlejohn .
your honor , this @-@ this stinks .
this phony dui charge was used as an excuse to ...
counselor , this is way past phony dui &apos;s
at this point-- i will deny the writ of habeas corpus ,
and allow the state &apos;s attorney
their 48 hours upon arrest to charge .
is the asa charging now , your honor ?
no , not until we get a match on the dna .
then it &apos;s illegal for them to collect and test jeffrey &apos;s dna .
and according to illinois law ,
they can only do that upon charges . not according
to the supreme court . in maryland v. king ...
which is a general rule .
the specific law in this state , your honor ,
is very , very clear about that .
okay , okay , hold on . if you two want
to debate like law students , go do it somewhere else .
for now , the kid stays in custody .
and if you want to test his dna ,
charge him .
i &apos;ll call your parents .
when can i get out ?
48 hours , max .
hang tight .
i ...
could you ... ?
david , hello !
what the hell are you doing here ?
answering my subpoena .
in reception ,
that &apos;s where people who don &apos;t work here wait .
you moved into my office pretty quick .
yes , after i cleaned the carpets of brimstone .
i &apos;ve hurt you , haven &apos;t i ?
mrs. florrick . hello .
ms. lockhart . hello .
so ... you &apos;re being sued again .
i &apos;m not sure how i can help you if i can &apos;t ...
it &apos;s the gopnik adoption .
myra gopnik ?
yes .
they lost her to the genetic parents .
they &apos;re suing us for $ 6 million ,
saying that we botched the adoption .
you didn &apos;t find out that the father was one @-@ eighth chippewa ,
so indian tribal courts held sway .
no , i knew that .
you did ?
and did you tell the gopniks ?
it was a long time ago .
it was less than a year ago .
i know . but so much has happened .
i &apos;ve been let go .
i &apos;ve had my financial requests rejected .
you &apos;re gonna blackmail us for your testimony ?
no , i &apos;m just telling the truth .
it &apos;s hard to remember when there &apos;s been
so much tension in my life about money .
what tension ?
my capital contribution .
the $ 150,000 i gave lockhart / gardner
as a first installment when i made partner .
the $ 150,000 that should &apos;ve been
returned to me when i left .
when you stole our clients .
david .
you know , sometimes i look at you
and i wonder if you &apos;ve changed
or if you were always this way .
i had some of the best teachers in the world .
i couldn &apos;t help but change .
so you will testify for us
if you get your capital contribution refunded ?
yes .
and what will your testimony be ?
the check first .
call me ... when you &apos;re ready .
she has us .
hi . are you here to look at the computers ?
um , no .
you &apos;re here for the law firm ?
yes .
okay . come on in .
this is florrick @-@ agos ?
it &apos;s cool , huh ?
yes . that &apos;s the word .
i &apos;ve reviewed ... your financials ,
and , um , i &apos;m sad to say they &apos;re not good .
keep in mind we &apos;re a new venture .
a new venture without offices , without paralegals ,
and with a high school girl answering the door .
there is no magic in the books--
30 % of your billables are spent reviewing depositions .
this is , uh ...
unfortunately work you can &apos;t bill at a premium .
but we need to do it .
we don &apos;t have the manpower to delegate .
yes .
that is why i suggest bangalore .
as in india ?
yes . law firms there
will perform your document review for pennies on the dollar .
and your markup ...
zach , i &apos;m in a meeting .
someone &apos;s ratting your computer .
what does that mean ?
remote access tool . rat .
the hacker infects your computer with it ,
and they can use your webcam to spy on you .
is someone doing that with my computer ?
yeah . i came in here , the webcam light was on ,
and then it shut off by itself .
when ?
couple hours ago .
is there anyone that would want to be able to access your webcam ?
why are you out here ?
my computer &apos;s been hacked .
by who ?
do you think they &apos;d do it ?
i think diane wouldn &apos;t . david lee might .
i was over there today , they &apos;re pretty angry .
i know a virus expert who can take care of this .
no , no , let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s use it .
give them false information ?
about clients we &apos;ve signed .
clients who are thinking of leaving them .
make them chase their tails .
you know you &apos;re running a firm here , not a children &apos;s game .
i don &apos;t know her .
i never met her . i know that she &apos;s at the same school ,
but i @-@ i ... it &apos;s a big school .
now , dani was found with ketamine in her system ...
i told you , i never met her .
and i don &apos;t do drugs , i @-@ i don &apos;t sell them .
it &apos;s fine , jeffrey .
we &apos;re just going through the facts here .
now , the original suspect from last year ,
the professor they arrested , did you know him ?
dr. delaney , yeah . i was in his statistics class .
but she wasn &apos;t in it .
yes , but this dr. delaney ,
he was having an affair with dani ?
that was the rumor .
okay , i &apos;ll look into it .
and we &apos;ll have to get into the dna .
it &apos;s not mine .
it can &apos;t be my skin under her nails .
we know , jeffrey , but we attack this case from all sides .
it &apos;s smart for us to do that ...
so tell me about your family .
the men in your family .
they have nothing to do with this .
to do with this .
jeffrey , familial dna means
they found dna they can trace to someone in your family .
your family is originally from new york , isn &apos;t it ?
does anybody else live here but you and your dad ?
my sister .
no , it has to be a man .
did anybody visit you at school ?
my uncle jim .
he dropped by last year for help on his computer .
i don &apos;t want to get anybody in trouble .
you &apos;re not . we just need to get a feel of the case .
i , uh , got permission for you to use your textbooks .
thanks . got final exams next week .
seems like you &apos;re really interested in italy .
yeah , i got an internship in rome next year .
ah . i went backpacking there after college .
yeah ? did you like it ?
oh , yeah . i always wanted to go back ,
but never got the chance-- just too busy .
i ... have never been out of the country .
do you think i &apos;ll get bail ?
we &apos;ll do our best .
sit tight , study .
think about those finals .
and i &apos;ll see you later , okay ?
yeah .
he did it .
no . he &apos;s just nervous .
no , he did it .
i think he did something .
maybe had a fight with her .
well , we need to stop them from charging him
and testing that dna .
where are you going ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
oh . she &apos;s gonna help us ?
yep . it &apos;s amazing what money will do .
well , hello again .
hello .
how are the isenstadts ?
unhappy .
i &apos;m sorry .
me , too .
and yet here we are with more human suffering .
can we get started ,
or did you both want to play cards ?
my apologies .
i had a real case to deal with .
well , let &apos;s see
if we can turn this into a real case for you .
how long did you work on the gopnik adoption ,
mrs. florrick ?
about four months .
were you the supervising attorney ?
i did the day @-@ to @-@ day management .
i looked at some of the documents the younger associates drew up .
which documents ? which associates ?
i believe john gaultner drafted
the initial inquiry letter .
anthony wright edelman
did the gopniks &apos; eligibility application ,
but ... really it was just shuffling paper .
mr. lee was the partner supervising the case overall .
and were you aware that the genetic father
of the adoptee was part chippewa indian ?
i was . or , to be more accurate ...
i became aware of that .
good . accuracy is our friend .
and were you also aware-- or ...
became aware-- that because of the child &apos;s chippewa heritage ,
the tribe had an absolute right to block this adoption ?
i was , and i became aware of this .
so given this awareness ,
how could you in good conscience
allow the gopniks to proceed down this path ?
because i told them of this possibility
and they wanted to go forward with the adoption .
are you sure of that ?
mrs. florrick testified to the fact ,
therefore she &apos;s sure of it .
excuse me , my understanding is that
you have since left lockhart / gardner ,
mrs. florrick , and therefore ...
oh ... wait ,
did i say &quot; left &quot; ?
i think the word i was looking f @-@ for was
&quot; fired . &quot;
when i left , mr. schmidt ,
i was a partner .
i couldn &apos;t be fired .
my mistake .
i just thought you would welcome this moment to be
more forthcoming about those who--
oh , what is the best word here ? --
&quot; pushed you out of their law firm . &quot;
there must be a ... german word to that effect .
gesundschrumpfen .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . now , i believe
that mrs. florrick has addressed the basis for her subpoena ,
so if there &apos;s nothing else ... - mrs. florrick ,
could you please tell me
what this is ?
it &apos;s a check
for $ 10,000 , drawn on the lockhart / gardner bank account ,
made out to the chippewa nation .
do you know what this check was for ?
i have no idea .
i &apos;ve never seen it before .
would it surprise you to learn this was a bribe
intended to convince the tribe
not to object to the adoption .
i object to this whole line of questioning as defamatory .
and your objection is preserved for the record .
would it also surprise you to learn
that in an affidavit ,
chief joshua proudfoot-- one word-- of the chippewa nation
asserts this check turned the tribe against the adoption ?
i can only say that if the facts you relate are true
then it does surprise me .
this was a case you were , in your words ,
performing the day @-@ to @-@ day management on .
mr. schmidt , she answered your question .
i just thought
alicia would jump at the chance to assign responsibility
to the firm that fired her .
alicia ?
no , i &apos;m good .
and have them test the audio beforehand .
last time i lectured there i sounded like lou gehrig .
professor delaney ?
yeah , may i help you ?
will gardner . i left you a couple messages
about dani littlejohn .
please , an innocent kid could be going to prison .
look , i have nothing to offer ; i was cleared of dani &apos;s murder .
now , leave me alone .
hey , i know you .
owen ?
yeah .
well , dr. cavanaugh . you &apos;re alicia &apos;s boss
from her work , will .
you teach here ?
i do . yeah , mathematical sciences .
professor of the month , actually .
i get all the frozen yogurt i want from yougogurt .
how &apos;s alicia doing ?
you haven &apos;t spoken to her recently ?
i haven &apos;t , no . why ? is everything okay ?
i @-@ i think so .
so , do you know dr. delaney ?
i do , yeah . why ?
this is pretty good .
you want another ?
&apos;cause i got , like , a lot .
no , thanks .
so , the cops suspected , uh ,
dr. delaney was sleeping with dani ?
yeah . i mean , i heard that , too .
delaney was going through a divorce at the time ,
and , um , there were rumors of the ...
oh , uh , you don &apos;t want to hear rumors .
i do .
he had the &quot; b @-@ plus club . &quot;
any student who did a b @-@ plus or better
got invited back to his house for dinner ,
and there were rumors-- and , again , i stress
they &apos;re only rumors-- that the kids would use it
to hook up , and he would encourage it .
do you know a student named jeffrey grant ?
i do , yeah . nice kid . why ?
we he a part of this b @-@ plus club ?
oh , i think so . i mean , he was a good student .
and dani littlejohn was , too ?
that &apos;s how dr. delaney became
close with her .
ooh , it &apos;s gossip . this is professor gossip .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the worst kind .
how &apos;s alicia doing ?
i don &apos;t know , owen .
she &apos;s no longer at my firm .
what ?
why ?
she left .
to start her own firm .
when ?
three weeks ago .
oh , my god . what ...
what happened ?
i have no idea .
yes ?
are you jim grant ?
if this is about the lawn ornaments ,
i stopped marketing them
online six months ago .
are you jeffrey grant &apos;s uncle ?
why ? is he all right ?
you visited him recently at college , right ?
who are you ?
kalinda .
how did you meet dani littlejohn ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
then how did your dna end up under her fingernails ?
they found dna from a male relation of jeffrey
under dani &apos;s fingernails , and you &apos;re the only male relative
who visited the college , so ...
when did you meet her ?
the dna is male , right ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re looking for a male relation ?
yeah .
uh , wait just a moment .
this is me .
pre @-@ op .
that &apos;s right . my nephew doesn &apos;t know .
that was 20 years ago .
i &apos;ve always been uncle jim to him .
thanks .
you know , there &apos;s something else jeffrey didn &apos;t know .
he has a half brother .
no , you know who i &apos;ve been getting interest from ?
the paisley group .
you mean diane &apos;s top client ?
y ... yeah , yeah ,
they , uh , they &apos;re not happy with her representation .
make sure they keep it secret
from lockhart / gardner .
hello , david . i &apos;m not returning
the capital contribution ; i already cashed it .
well , you may not want to spend it yet ,
because you &apos;re gonna need to come up with $ 6 million .
why , are you gonna countersue me ?
no . we went over the billing records
after your wonderful deposition performance , and guess what ?
smack in the middle of the adoption proceedings ,
you were promoted to partner .
no .
yes . so partner plus day @-@ to @-@ day management of a case
equals supervisory authority .
call it a perk of leadership , but you &apos;re personally liable ...
for the whole $ 6 million .
it &apos;s my issue . wait .
it &apos;s not a florrick @-@ agos issue .
it &apos;s mine .
no , it &apos;s all of ours .
if they come after you , they come after all of us .
thanks . but i ...
no buts .
you &apos;d do the same for us .
i don &apos;t understand .
they &apos;re countersuing you ?
they &apos;re saying that
since i became a partner while that case was pending ,
i &apos;m responsible for everything that happened on it ,
including the bribe .
so if the gopniks win ,
i &apos;m personally liable for the full $ 6 million .
i &apos;ll get it !
i need a lawyer . you know where i can find one ?
feels like somebody needs some loving in their life .
who told you ?
who told me what ?
i &apos;m starting my own firm . mom ?
no .
actually , um ...
oddly ...
can we sit down ?
why ?
oh , because ...
oh , wow , you really are trying to do this
from your living room .
it &apos;s temporary .
so ... who told you i left lockhart / gardner ?
oddly enough , it was will .
he ... what ?
um , i don &apos;t un ... he ... what ... when ...
oh , this is very entertaining , watching you flail .
well , he ...
did will talk to you ?
yeah , he was at my college on a case ,
and i bumped into him .
he @-@ he didn &apos;t say anything .
it was only after i pushed him .
okay . good to know .
so , why didn &apos;t you tell me you were leaving ?
i was pushed out , owen . i didn &apos;t have time .
will pushed me out .
because you were thinking of leaving
and taking some of his clients ?
did he tell you that ?
no , no , i &apos;m just reading your body language here ,
and you &apos;re in , like , warrior @-@ princess mode .
well , i &apos;m kicking butt .
yeah , i can see that .
i also know why you left , and that it has nothing to do
with starting your own firm .
oh , owen , can we not do this now ?
what ? you were afraid of getting close to will .
hey . do you want something to eat ?
will you admit it ? you were afraid
of leaving your marriage for will ,
so this is like the nuclear bomb ...
oh , hey , grace .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
nothing . just visiting your lovely mother
at her new law firm .
have you seen zach , mom ?
what ?
could you ... there &apos;s ... there &apos;s something .
what &apos;s wrong ? what ...
when ?
about five minutes ago .
is there something else , mr. hayden ?
there is .
i think ... i think bangalore , it &apos;ll work .
yes .
no , it &apos;s about mrs. florrick &apos;s lawsuit .
do you know something ?
i worked with the books at lockhart / gardner .
i know everything .
alicia .
so , what special entertainment
do you have for me this round ?
mr. lee , always a pleasure .
why don &apos;t you give up on this suit ?
you &apos;re never gonna win .
i like suits i can &apos;t win .
they clarify the mind .
well , let &apos;s go do some clarifying .
one second .
just ... waiting for my next witness .
mr. hayden . thank you for doing this .
mr. lee . good to see you again .
and how do you know this , sir ?
i was the bankruptcy trustee for lockhart / gardner
at the time of these events .
judas .
did you get that ?
mr. lee , in a clumsy attempt at intimidation ,
objection .
might have said it too quietly .
&quot; judas . &quot;
as in judas iscariot , the betrayer of christ .
and so you were privy to lockhart / gardner &apos;s books ?
yes .
mr. hayden ,
much of this information is privileged .
not this information , ma &apos;am .
lockhart / gardner is contending that
alicia florrick was the supervisor at the time of this bribe
to the indian council .
is that correct ?
no .
in october , i recommended to ms. lockhart and mr. gardner
that they dedicate more partner hours to cases .
and david lee was assigned as the lawyer of record .
which means he was
legally responsible for supervising ?
and personally liable here .
looks like it &apos;s back in your court .
yeah , kalinda , what &apos;s up ?
i found his half brother .
you did ? great .
yeah . i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll let me cotton @-@ swab his mouth ,
but i &apos;ll see what i can get .
office is up front if you want to place an order .
actually , i &apos;m here to talk to you .
you &apos;re ... anderson prickett , right ?
and you are ?
kalinda sharma .
i &apos;m investigating working conditions
at companies in the area .
look , uh ...
i just want to make sure that
management isn &apos;t harassing you .
harassing me for ... ?
your arrest last year , for one .
you were busted dealing ketamine , right ?
you with the labor board ?
also trying to make sure
that workers aren &apos;t getting their pay docked for sick days .
your manager said you called in sick last year
on the 15th of august .
where were you ?
what are you doing ?
so you acknowledge
bringing the gopnik adoption case in the door ?
well , i &apos;m not sure what you mean
by &quot; in the door . &quot;
mr. lee , i &apos;ve got mrs. florrick outside
ready to be re @-@ deposed ,
so can we handle this civilly ?
i brought in the business .
so , the $ 10,000 that was sent to the reservation ...
i &apos;ve already said it didn &apos;t come from me .
but i know who sent it .
you do ? and who might that be ?
the brother looks good for this .
and the gum ?
that &apos;s not something they can ignore .
absolutely . it &apos;s already over there .
geneva knows .
they &apos;re checking the dna .
20 hours to go . i &apos;ll talk to you .
i didn &apos;t supervise him .
and who is this person ,
this anthony wright edelman ?
oh , one of these little idiots who left with alicia-- the indian kid .
and you &apos;re saying he sent out the bribe to the chippewa council ?
i &apos;m swearing he sent it out .
how very convenient for you ,
given that alicia superv ...
yes , i offered the tribe cash
to sign off on the adoption .
what were you thinking ?
i was thinking i wanted to win .
you lost their adoption .
their adoption was lost .
i was making a last @-@ ditch ...
you just screwed over alicia .
wait .
did you consult with david lee before you sent out the check ?
no .
did you consult with anyone else ? any partner ?
howard lyman .
you consulted with howard lyman ?
and he approved ?
he did .
well , we need to get you deposed .
call carter schmidt .
zach , it &apos;s on !
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . just something for zach .
yeah , we have to do some stuff for school ,
mom-- on my computer .
it just came on a second ago .
okay , so , once we go in ,
just start undressing , all right ?
what ?
just take off your sweater or something , all right ?
you need to keep the hacker online long enough
for us to trace him .
how you doing , will ?
you know you have five hours left
to charge or release .
i did know that .
but i thought we &apos;d sit down together
and see if maybe we could work out a deal .
they can &apos;t make their case . they want to bargain .
sure , geneva . so ,
you tested the dna from the ketamine @-@ dealing
half brother , didn &apos;t you ? the gum ?
this isn &apos;t about the dna .
it is about saving the state
a costly and time @-@ consuming trial .
well , there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d rather do than save the state money .
see you in a half hour . good @-@ bye .
get a good deal .
owen ? hi . what are you ...
i @-@ i just need a minute , will .
okay . um , we &apos;re not looking at
dr. delaney as a suspect anymore .
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m here about alicia .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t do this right now .
alicia was afraid of falling in love with you .
that &apos;s why she left .
it &apos;s okay . everything &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s ... clearly not fine .
i want my sister to be happy .
you really think she was itching to start her own firm ?
she and her partners are reusing paper clips .
alicia was afraid to work beside you .
that &apos;s all .
it was easier to start hating you
than to own the feelings she had toward you .
that &apos;s why you two are in this @-@ this ...
ridiculous war .
she and peter ,
they &apos;re not set in stone .
no .
it &apos;s over .
good @-@ bye .
stiles .
hey . did you see what colin &apos;s sending around ?
it &apos;s nasty .
what the hell ? what are you doing ?
stop ratting my sister . you hear me ?
hey , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
my sister . stop it .
jeffrey , this is good news .
they want a plea bargain .
that means their evidence might not be lining up .
i &apos;m scared . i know . it &apos;s okay .
they want to keep you scared so you take a bad deal .
you keep a poker face .
just listen , nod ,
and we &apos;ll talk afterwards , okay ?
involuntary manslaughter . two years .
okay , we &apos;ll think about it .
it &apos;s either that or
life in prison , jeff .
you &apos;re 22 years old . think about that future .
thanks , geneva . we &apos;ll consider it .
you want to see italy at some point in your life ,
take this deal .
time to let us talk , geneva .
did you kill dani littlejohn ?
no .
is there any way your skin could &apos;ve ended up under her fingernails ?
no .
you didn &apos;t know her at all , never even met her ?
never .
then you &apos;re innocent ...
and you should reject this deal .
okay .
no .
you have to tell me .
i reject this deal .
good .
so why do i feel so nervous ?
because this stuff isn &apos;t meant to be easy .
so , what &apos;s this about , a new offer ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
well , not exactly a new ...
actually , yes , maybe we should call it a new one .
you should &apos;ve taken that two years .
and you should &apos;ve already checked the dna on that gum .
his half brother did it .
we did check it . it &apos;s not him .
so i charged your client
with dani littlejohn &apos;s murder ,
and i expedited his dna .
it &apos;s a hundred percent match .
jeffrey said he never met her ,
but that is his dna under her fingernails .
he killed that girl .
sorry ,
you &apos;ll have to wait for discovery .
don &apos;t be upset , will . clients lie .
anthony wright edelman .
mr. edelman , were you staffed as an associate
on the adoption that is the subject of this lawsuit ?
i was .
and on march 6 , 2013,
did you send chief joshua proudfoot
of the chippewa nation a check for $ 10,000
to induce the tribe not to object to the adoption ?
i did .
at whose direction did you deliver this inducement ?
alicia florrick &apos;s .
alicia florrick ?
are you sure ?
yes . mrs. florrick told me we had to make the payment
to facilitate the adoption .
what are you doing ?
i will remind mrs. florrick that
she is not a party to this deposition .
she &apos;s here as a courtesy .
and if she interrupts again ,
she &apos;ll be asked to leave .
so mrs. florrick was the partner
supervising you on this matter ?
that &apos;s correct .
were you working at any other partner &apos;s behest ?
no . just mrs. florrick &apos;s .
you want to tell me what that was about ?
welcome back .
thank you .
isn &apos;t it nice ?
we had a partnership position open ,
so anthony got it .
i will file a complaint with the acdb .
i will sue you for conspiracy .
you &apos;ll do nothing but fail .
stop ratting our computers . it &apos;s illegal .
it &apos;s ... what are you talking about ?
do it again
and we &apos;ll bring charges .
sure , whatever you say .
good luck with your firm , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;d start putting my $ 6 million together now .
i didn &apos;t lie .
you only hurt yourself--
you could &apos;ve had two years .
i didn &apos;t lie .
i never met her .
then how did your dna end up ...
i don &apos;t know , i ...
i ... i don &apos;t know .
okay . okay , let me see what i can do .
i &apos;m never getting out of here , am i ?
i &apos;ll ask for bail , but i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re gonna probably transfer you to county .
and don &apos;t talk to anyone .
cellmates are prone to snitch .
oh , my god .
listen .
we &apos;re going to trial .
i &apos;ll try to move fast , but it could take six months .
i need you to hold it together , okay ?
jeff , look at me .
okay ?
i &apos;m not giving up .
don &apos;t you give up , either .
we &apos;re trying to get our heads around the anthony thing .
he blindsided all of us .
the question is , how much can he hurt us .
a lot . he &apos;ll dish on every strategy he was privy to .
how you doing ?
okay . go ahead , clarke .
mrs. florrick ,
even without office space , you &apos;re sinking
under the cost of overhead .
malpractice insurance , staff salaries , marketing costs ...
your fee .
yes . overhead .
what you need to be doing now is billing hours--
a lot of them-- and without anthony ,
your manpower crisis has worsened .
he wants us to hire him .
i &apos;m a full @-@ fledged member of the bar now , mrs. florrick ,
and business expertise is something you are sorely lacking .
mr. hayden ...
your books are in disarray .
i will get you on your feet financially .
and he &apos;ll work for free .
why ?
well ... i like ...
... the law .
now , i will only work for free until the firm is profitable ,
which i will work day and night to achieve .
once we &apos;re in the black , then i want my salary retroactively .
thank you .
no , we &apos;ll be thanking you .
zach !
zach , what happened ?
uh , nothing . i was playing baseball ,
someone hit me with their elbow .
well , you need to get ice on that .
yeah ?
thanks .
yeah , stiles is a jerk , huh ?
yeah , i know .
but ...
thank you .
