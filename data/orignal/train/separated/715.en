Daniel didn't die trying to kill Emily.
He saved her.
I have to start at the beginning
with a damaged little girl named Amanda Clarke,
also known as Emily Thorne.
Xanax. Calms my nerves.
Those pills you're taking -- it's compounded with Larium.
Your family's been drugging you.
As long as I'm incapacitated,
mother controls the inheritance.
As long as Malcolm Black is out there,
our lives are in danger.
I'm dealing with him.
Threatening him with evidence
is a temporary solution at best, David.
Go to the FBI and ask for protection.
They can't help us. Look, I know how to stop him.
This has to end.
I want you to know, in case anything happens to me,
there's a flash drive --
Evidence that I've accumulated of all his criminal activity.
I-I turned in the flash drive, anonymously.
There was enough evidence on there
to put him away for the rest of his life.
If you only knew how wrong you are.
I heard a S.W.A.T. team
arrested a guy named Malcolm Black earlier.
They turned him over to the Feds.
But then I heard he was released.
I came for your father.
Look what I found.
Night-night.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Then where are we?
Looks like some kind of refuse depot by the water.
The last thing I remember
is Malcolm Black at the lighthouse.
That's impossible. Malcolm is dead.
What game are you playing, Emily?
It's not a game, Victoria.
And as you can see, I'm very much alive.
And so it seems, are you, Amanda Clarke.
Must have been really tough,
keeping your identity a secret for so long.
Well, your secret's out.
What do you want with us?
If it's money, we'll pay it.
I don't need your money.
But I need your help.
We have to send David Clarke...
a wee message.
David.
I'm sorry to burst in here like this but --
What are you doing?
Malcolm won't be in jail for long.
It's best if Amanda and I disappear while we still have the time.
The Feds already released him.
I told you so.
He has other agents on his payroll.
What about my flash drive?
It's also gone.
When?
I didn't call in case they had your phone tapped.
I warned you about this, but you wouldn't listen.
Malcolm Black will be out for blood.
Thinks I double-crossed him.
I did what I thought was right.
Yeah, and look where that got us.
We have to act fast. I'm gonna go get Amanda.
Should have never, Shouldn't have kept her in the dark about this.
She's trained for it.
She can be an asset.
I'll look for Malcolm.
When you talked to him,
did you get any sense of where he might be,
anything that could lead me to him?
No, he's too smart for that,
but you were right not to call my cellphone.
He's already tracking my every move.
He -- he's not far.
He thinks Kate's still alive, so
he won't leave here without her.
Meet back at Grayson Manor.
Watch your back.
I'm starting to think
you don't know the meaning of "Personal days."
I need to talk to you now.
Well, take it easy.
What's your problem, Porter?
I need you to help me find someone --
No questions asked.
All right, I'll bite.
Malcolm Black.
The guy we just turned over to the Feds?
The guy the Feds just released.
There's a lot more you don't know.
Like he wants David Clarke dead?
How did you...
The David Clarke who wasn't really imprisoned
for the last 10 years?
The father of Amanda Clarke,
who, as it turns out, is Emily Thorne?
I know the whole story, Porter.
Ben, you can't tell anyone.
There are lives at stake here.
Well, I haven't decided what I'm gonna do yet,
and as for needing help,
I don't think I'm gonna put my life on the line
for a bunch of people who've been lying to me.
All right, look, you have every right to be pissed,
but there's more.
I think that Alvarez's disappearance
is tied to Malcolm, too.
So, you think he's dead.
I don't know, but if there's a chance he's not...
Alvarez saved my ass years ago.
I owe him.
Malcolm had double agents working with the Feds.
He might even have people
right here in our own department.
Please, man, I need your help.
Emily?
Emily!
Emily?
Didn't expect to hear from me again so soon, now,
did you, Clarke?
I told you.
You're out of your league.
So, now we do things my way.
I want my daughter back,
alive and unharmed.
I'll give you until noon tomorrow
because I want these ladies here
to enjoy
what might be their last night on earth.
Bring my daughter.
第四季第十三集
I got your message.
No leads on Malcolm,
but I got here as soon as I could.
It's okay.
He knows the truth about everything...
including Emily.
Seems to me you can use all the help you can get.
He kidnapped them.
He's holding them in exchange
for the safe return of his daughter.
We have till noon.
Yeah, if we could give him proof
that Kate was still alive, then...
you know, maybe we can buy ourselves some time
to look for them.
How exactly do you plan to do that
for someone who died several days ago?
By re-editing Kate's voice memos from her phone.
There's not enough to go on there to fool Malcolm.
Just bits and pieces -- it doesn't add up to anything.
What about your buddy Nolan Ross?
Isn't he some kind of computer genius?
I can't put anybody else's life at risk.
So that's it?
There's no other options?
There might be. That's why I called you down here.
I was hoping that this isn't the only phone
that I can pull her voice from.
因袭击前女友被射杀身亡
I was so blind.
Emily went to extreme measures to ensure we all were.
What are we going to do about it?
Margaux, there's nothing to do.
My father's death, your son's...
Emily was behind all of it.
She's a criminal.
Why would you not want to punish her?
20 years ago,
when Daniel's life was threatened,
I chose to save him, and in so doing,
I hurt her father.
I feel I owe it to David.
Please, Margaux.
Keep this between us.
It's Margaux Lemarchal.
Meet me tonight.
I need your services.
Why don't you save your energy?
There's no way of getting out of there.
But I do love watching you try.
Cheeky monkeys.
By my estimate, Malcolm or one of his men
come back to check on us every 30 minutes,
we're gonna have to work fast,
maybe move one of these boxes
to ram the gate before he comes back.
Do you hear me?
We need to move fast.
We don't have to do anything.
I'm loath to follow any plan you've concocted, Emily.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Well, you've given me little reason to help you,
let alone live.
It's not about us.
It's about everyone else who's gonna suffer
if we don't get out of here alive,
including my father.
Your words hold no meaning for me anymore.
It's funny, isn't it?
Who would have thought
that after all was said and done,
you and I would die together?
Keeping up with your brother's campaign, I see.
Oh, no.
Oh, easy, darling.
It's not even noon,
and already you're trying to dull your senses.
You're not really here.
Well, of course I am, Lou-Lou.
Aren't you glad to see your mama?
You must be Nolan Ross.
I have heard so much about you.
Penelope Ellis.
Mama Ellis... in the flesh.
You must have come to refill
your daughter's prescriptions, no doubt?
Pardon?
Don't mind me.
Louise, dear, give your mama a hug.
Oh, I have been worried sick about you.
Lyman says you are not doing well.
As you can see, I'm doing perfectly fine.
Well, with him back out on the campaign trail,
I thought maybe you and I could spend some time together.
Actually Louise and I had plans.
A deep tissue massage and seaweed facial awaits.
Well, fine.
I should probably get back to the house
and settle in first.
The house?
Oh, you mean you're not just staying at a hotel for the night?
I have decided to rent a place in the Hamptons for the summer.
That way you and I can be close to each other all the time,
the way a real family should be.
One big, happy, indeed.
Clarke.
Well, you were always a little slow
when presented with a task, weren't you?
I needed time to get to Kate,
but I'm here now and looking at her.
Yeah, it's me.
I'm here.
Katie? Katie, darling?
You can hear her. She's alive and well.
So cooperate, or that's gonna change in a hurry.
No, you listen to me.
This is not a negotiation.
I want my daughter back now.
It's over.
I'm sorry.
Jack.
Clarke, you are really...
really trying my patience.
Now, let me speak to my daughter.
Cedar Hill. Sundown.
You bring Victoria and Amanda, and I'll bring Kate.
I'm telling you, we should bring in the S.W.A.T. Team.
They know how to handle hostage situations.
Malcolm already infiltrated law enforcement.
Kate was proof of that, as are the FEDs that let him go.
Yeah, but one of those hostages could be Alvarez.
He would know how to work it from the inside.
You have to trust me.
Because you have such a great track record
when it comes to trust?
Hey, I didn't ask for your help.
Guys, enough!
We only have a few hours till sundown.
You're wasting what little time we have.
That exchange with Malcolm
is gonna have to be our last resort.
Finding the women...it's gonna be nearly impossible.
We could check at the station...
see if Emily's car popped up on the abandoned-vehicle log.
It's a good place to start.
We'll find them, David.
I hope you're right.
Mother.
Oh, you're not leaving, are you?
I was hoping we could get a late lunch.
I'm afraid I'm busy. I'm running behind...
Oh, this is just a lovely hotel.
And you certainly are settling in nicely around here.
I'm so glad to see you happy, Louise.
You can drop the act now, Mother.
We're alone.
What do you want?
Lyman said you gave him a lot of trouble.
That wasn't very nice.
Well, neither was drugging me for most of my life,
but that didn't seem to stop the two of you.
You are not well, Louise.
You haven't been ever since your daddy died.
You need those pills to stay sane.
Those pills you tricked me
into taking had horrible side effects,
which included seeing a lot more of you than I wanted to.
Yes, Lyman told me about that.
You see, those are exactly the kind of ravings
that led Judge Miller
to appoint me your legal conservator.
First, you start off with that nasty article,
now these wild claims about drugging you.
I can see I got here just in time.
My Lyman has potential.
I'm gonna be the mother of a congressman,
and I will not let you ruin that.
He always did come first, didn't he?
He always let you spend whatever you wanted
as long as you behaved.
Now, you will keep quiet, or the money stops.
You can't cut me off.
But I can.
Judge said so.
Don't fight me on this, Louise.
You'll come out on the losing end,
like always.
That's Emily's car.
You think this is where he kidnapped her?
I don't know.
What the hell was she doing out here?
I don't know.
I thought you knew everything about her.
Look, I was in the dark for a while too.
When did you find out the truth?
About a year and a half ago.
Whoa, what, wait... how did that feel?
Knowing she was lying to you about who she was?
It took me a while to make my peace with it,
but I did.
And I kept her secret because --
because revealing it would have hurt her.
She's on the right side of this war,
whether you know it or not.
There's no sign of struggle.
We do have a security cam, which means we can see
what kind of car Malcolm was driving,
maybe which way they headed.
The parks department is near my house.
Get the security footage. Meet me there at my place.
Wait -- where are you going?
To tell David there might be another way!
Ladies... I brought you some food.
Thought you might need to keep your strength up.
I'd hate for David to think I was mistreating you.
What's the point?
You're gonna kill us anyway, aren't you?
Why wait for David
when there's someone else who knows where she is?
I'm listening.
You're a businessman.
Surely you know that valuable information has a cost.
What do you want?
My freedom, of course.
You don't cage a majestic peacock
with a howler monkey.
I'll give you your freedom,
if your information has proven valuable.
Victoria, don't say another word.
Perhaps you've heard of a man named Jack Porter?
Yeah.
You can be certain that David made Jack aware of his plan,
so I would go find him if I were you.
He might prove very helpful
as to your daughter's whereabouts.
This is just a desperate attempt to save herself
with information that she doesn't have.
Ivan.
Don't you dare.
Go see our friend Mr. Porter again.
Find out what he knows.
No!
Enough.
You, tie them up.
They just won't respect what little freedom I give them.
You, get on your way.
And whatever answers you get from Porter,
after that, feel free to kill him.
We found Emily's car near the lighthouse.
Ben's checking the security footage
to see what Malcolm was driving.
We can put out an APB on his car.
It's too late, Jack.
What are you talking about?
There's still time.
It's almost sundown.
Okay.
Then how are we doing this?
No, it's my problem, not yours.
You can't do this alone.
No, I'm the one to blame.
I put my friends and family in harm's way,
especially Amanda.
As soon as I found out who she was,
I should have taken her away from all this.
Now I might lose her
without even spending a day with her.
I've seen her through a lot in these last few years,
and if there's one thing I know
it's that she can take care of herself.
She'll find a way to survive, David.
She always has.
In a few hours, this will all be over...
one way or the other.
Well, I'm not giving up.
You know,
when you walked up to me at the lighthouse,
I thought you were going to kill me.
Now I wished you had.
You and I both know
that we're only in this situation
because of the photo that you sent
that led Kate straight to me.
You were already onto Kate,
and we were both just trying to help David.
It all comes back to my father, doesn't it?
Are you driven by the guilt you have
for what you did to him?
Love is complicated.
He doesn't love you.
How do you think I knew to send you to the lighthouse?
My father said that it would be the perfect place
to stage a grieving mother's suicide.
From the moment my father returned to the Hamptons,
he's been plotting your death.
Ladies.
Nice to see you two finally settling in,
but I'm afraid it's time to take a little field trip.
So, let me get this straight... you breathe a word to anyone
about the dosing and she cuts you off?
Sounds about right.
Your father left you that money.
You're off the pills, ergo, no longer cray-cray.
You can make decisions for yourself.
Yeah, try telling that to any judge in Savannah.
My mom's got a team of lawyers
that has every one of them paid off,
which means the conservatorship sticks
and she keeps control of my money.
How did you put up with her all those years?
Easy.
I had my daddy.
I remember this one time,
she tried to banish me to boarding school,
but when we got there,
my father was waiting on the steps.
He put me back in the car and told her
she could find her own way home.
It sounds like he was the only one
who was able to go a few rounds with mommy dearest.
Yeah, he just couldn't win the fight with himself.
He knew his drinking would get the best of him,
which is I think he left me the money.
He wanted me to be safe from her.
And yet, that is exactly the thing
that's putting you in danger right now.
I'm scared, Nolan.
Without my bank account, I just...
I don't know how to live.
Mama deserves to suffer for what she did,
but I don't think I can make it on my own.
And you can't give up.
Your daddy wanted you to have that money, not her.
There's got to be another way.
We just...
we haven't figured it out yet.
You find anything on the tapes?
Ben?
What the hell?
Been a long time, Clarke.
Yeah, not long enough.
Where's my daughter?
Where's Amanda?
What, you think I'll bring both of them
untill I know that my daughter is safe?
Kate's in the van, but I expect to see Amanda...
Shut up.
Don't bother.
How stupid do you think I am?
She was never alive,
and you're gonna suffer the same fate.
No!
Go ahead. Get it over with.
You know what?
That would be too easy, my friend.
I'm gonna need to see you suffer first.
This guy got the jump on me
while I was watching he security footage.
He thought I was you,
wanted to know where Kate was being held.
How did Malcolm figure out I was involved?
Hell if I know.
What did you find on the tapes?
Nothing.
Emily's car was the last to pull into the lot.
Nobody came in or left after her.
It doesn't make any sense.
Even when this guy wakes up,
he's never give up Malcolm's location.
Wait, wait, wait.
This... this... it's a message from Emily.
A star?
No, when we were kids,
we... we would play treasure hunt,
and w-we'd draw a map,
and we'd put a star with a circle on it...
that's where the treasure was buried.
I know it sounds crazy.
What?
Okay, but, I mean, without a map,
you don't really have much to go on.
We got to be missing something.
I'm not sure it matters.
It's dark now. We never heard back from David.
Maybe we're too late.
This guy's been walking through coal.
She used this to draw that.
No other cars pulled into the lot last night
because she wasn't taken by car.
She was taken by boat
to the one place that still uses coal for their incinerator.
The trash yard down on the water.
What happened?
It's over.
Sit down.
Let them go.
All the time we've been together,
you should know me better than that.
I'm gonna kill you.
That's for damn sure.
But I thought it'd be be more fun for you
to watch them die first.
They got nothing to do with it. It's me you want.
You know what?
You're right.
But just for old time's sake,
why don't you do the work while I watch?
I know in the past you were of great help to my father
when he needed things taken care of.
Pascal was very good to me.
May he rest in peace.
And that appreciation will continue.
There's a woman who needs to pay for crossing me.
You want me to pin something on her?
That won't be necessary.
She's already committed the crimes.
Then why not turn her over to the police?
I'm missing one crucial detail --
evidence.
That's where you come in.
I'll start by tapping her phone.
All I need's a name and a number.
I get quick results.
Quick results are exactly what I'm looking for.
I'm waiting, Clarke.
I said...
I'm waiting, Clarke!
Leave him alone!
Go to hell!
Go to hell?
Great idea!
How's that for hell?!
You had to make it complicated.
One slit across the throat,
and it'd have been a quick death for both of them.
So, now we do it my way...
in pieces.
It's easier to burn the evidence.
No, wait.
Wait.
Stay away from her!
This is for killing my daughter.
I did it!
I killed Kate.
She murdered my son,
and I shot that bitch in cold blood.
You?
You!
You know the best part?
I loved it.
Go ahead.
Stab me like a coward.
Like a coward?
Let her go!
Not another move.
We're gonna get you out of here.
No.
Emily!
Wait.
No!
Drawing our treasure-hunt sign on Malcolm's gunman
was a smart move.
After I convinced Victoria to create a distraction.
I guess her guilt is finally catching up with her.
She knew she had to help.
I'm glad she did.
It made all the difference.
You're still here.
I was out of options.
But I knew that you and my father
were working together
and that you'd be all right.
Well, we had a little help from Ben, too.
They found Alvarez's personal effects
at the warehouse.
He's taking it pretty hard.
What are you gonna tell the detectives?
I'll start with the truth...
that Malcolm was released by double agents within the FBI
and we didn't know who we could trust.
I'm not sure
it'll be that easy to explain all of this to Ben.
It'll be easier than you think.
David.
I can't believe you did that...
taking the blame for killing Kate
and saving Amanda.
I don't know what to say.
Emily and I united in a plan
that we hoped would lead Jack to find us.
I thought I'd sacrifice myself to buy you both more time.
It worked.
I now know that you were trying to kill me,
before I confessed my sins to you and even after.
Victoria...
You know, I could call the police
and reveal your sins to them, but I won't.
You and Emily deserve a life together.
I need to mourn my son.
It's what we all deserve.
We need to go our separate ways, David.
Goodbye.
I got your message. What are we celebrating?
The end of your control over Louise.
My legal team found a loophole in your conservatorship.
Seems you only remain in charge of your daughter...
until she finds a husband.
Guess who just got married.
You did what?
And that makes me her conservator now,
which means Louise is finally free of you.
Penny for your thoughts?
I think congratulations are in order.
I think I will grab us a bottle of our best dom to celebrate.
Do you really think you've won?
The law is the law, mother.
It was a clever attempt, dear, but this is not over,
and you will give me control back,
or the real truth will come out.
What are you talking about?
Those pills only helped your feeble, little mind
to forget what you really did.
You killed your father.
And once I tell that new husband of yours
and the rest of the world,
you will truly be left with nothing.
Just like you deserve.
Dad, why aren't you at the hospital?
I was getting treated
when I heard him arguing with the doctors.
They wanted him to stay the night,
but he wasn't having it.
He's stubborn.
Yeah, well, runs in the family.
Yeah, I'm starting to see that.
Well, I told the docs I'd get him home safe.
Thank you. We owe you a lot.
Well, I'll take it from here.
Well, good night.
Ben, wait.
I don't know what we did to deserve your help, but..
I'm just glad you're both okay.
Why are you helping us?
I spoke to Jack.
I know that you know.
I'm sorry.
I was relieved, actually.
All this time, I thought the reason
you were always acting so weird around me
was because of me.
Not true.
And as to why I'm helping...
When I was a rookie, I worked undercover.
And I had to assume another identity for months
to help take down a drug ring.
So you think you know what I went through?
No.
No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all,
but... but I do understand how hard it is
to break people's trust in order to protect them.
Not being able to be yourself, having to push people away.
It gets to you after a while.
It's lonely.
So, while I don't know exactly what you've been through,
I know it must've been for the right reasons
if you were willing to sacrifice so much.
Thank you for saying that.
And you don't have to worry about this going any further.
So what do you say, beginning tomorrow,
we... we start over?
I'd say I'd like that very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Victoria.
How awful.
And to know David has been betraying you all along.
Well, a part of me sensed that his feelings
weren't genuine for some time.
I'm just glad I know for certain.
Which means your loyalty to him is no longer warranted.
Emily deserves to pay for what she's done.
She may not have put the bullet in Daniel,
but she's the reason so much misery
has come into our lives.
An expose splashed across
my media outlets around the world
could lead to a lengthy prison sentence.
Emily's not worth your time.
Besides, revenge is a dangerous game.
And the only thing that's important to me now
is you and my grandchild.
And you're important to me, as well.
But honoring Daniel's memory is something
I have to do.
Very well.
But heed my warning...
Emily hasn't left a trail of evidence.
Do not do anything until you have irrefutable proof.
Not to worry.
I have a way to get the evidence I need.
It will be me who destroys her.
