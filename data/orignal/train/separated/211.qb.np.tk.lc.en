estelle horizon 一灯大狮 西林 henry
gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
well , i spoke with the parole board .
i gave them my address as
where you &apos;ll be reporting in january .
i can &apos;t tell you how much this means to me .
thanks to you , my brother is currently serving
a 5 @-@ year sentence .
i never accused ben of any crime .
i saw the affidavit .
i didn &apos;t sign anything .
then who did ?
lily &apos;s selling bass industries .
i won &apos;t let you do this , lily .
since my mom isn &apos;t gonna help get ben out of jail ,
i wanna find the judge whose name is on the affidavit .
why don &apos;t you come with me ?
serena , i would love to go away with you ,
but it feels like this trip
is something you might need to do on your own .
i @-@ i promise you i &apos;m gonna be very busy writing ,
seeing &quot; ninette &quot; at the film forum .
i &apos;m seeing &quot; ninette &quot; at film forum .
it &apos;s a cold new year , upper east siders .
time to donate that fall wardrobe to the help
and to present the world with a better version of you ...
which could mean facing your future ...
and forgetting past mistakes ...
or finally settling on a brave new path .
but a new year doesn &apos;t wipe away old problems .
well , welcome back . all this for two weeks ?
i had no idea where my p.i. mission was gonna take me .
i had to be prepared .
for a night with taylor swift ?
aside from forging affidavits that send innocent men to jail ,
judge stephens also enjoys riding horses
on his ranch in virginia .
well , someone did her research .
apparently , not enough , because he wasn &apos;t there ,
and no one knew where he was ,
so i had to pull an erin brockovich and go down
to the litchfield county clerk &apos;s office
to try to get a copy of the case .
and how &apos;s this for irony ?
court records are public ,
so you wore a push @-@ up bra for no reason ?
no , the file was sealed
because the case involved a minor .
just take me away from my problems .
please , tell me ,
what did you do over the break ?
why ? what did you hear ?
i ... ate leftovers
and supervised dorota taking down the tree ,
and i finally settled
on who i want to intern for this semester .
indra nooyi--
&quot; forbes &apos; &quot; number six
most powerful woman in the world .
wow . i &apos;m impressed .
as she will be once
i figure out how to win her over
before the internship deadline , which , yes , is in three days .
did you ... happen to see dan over the break ?
why would i ?
what &apos;s going on with you two anyway ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess we &apos;ll find out
how we both feel at family brunch .
well , here &apos;s my advice .
have a little faith .
and if that doesn &apos;t work , a lot of mimosas .
hey , man . how was new zealand ?
i have to say , it was an extraordinary bust .
jack was out of the country .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . man .
i knew you were counting on his help .
as fate would have it ,
i might &apos;ve found one last ally .
my father &apos;s old friend russell thorpe
is in town from chicago .
he &apos;s hosting a party at apella this afternoon .
i &apos;m on my way to his field office
to see if i can get a meeting .
give it !
i hear you &apos;ve kept yourself entertained in my absence .
no , that &apos;s not me .
that &apos;s right .
your father &apos;s out on parole . how &apos;s it been ?
40 @-@ 15 .
i know he &apos;s earned the right to blow off a little steam ,
but it &apos;s been nothing but spas and restaurants and nightclubs .
i mean , shouldn &apos;t he be concentrating on--on his future ?
perhaps you should dock his allowance .
oh , yeah ! hey , nate , need one more for a foursome .
you in , dude ?
that &apos;s not what it sounded like .
but i should go . good luck .
you , too .
boom goes the dynamite !
people still use mailboxes ?
oh . no , it &apos;s vanessa &apos;s mail .
she &apos;s moving back into the dorms .
welcome home .
so ... how was your break ? what did you do ?
why ? what &apos;d you hear ?
nothing , which i &apos;m afraid
is what i have to report from my road trip .
mm . i &apos;m sorry . i know you were hoping for some closure .
well , my mom &apos;s deviousness is the gift that keeps on giving .
so , for now at least , the past still lingers .
uh , was brunch a special occasion ?
no , no , no . i have an interview with writers house later .
it &apos;s a literary agency for my internship .
well , that &apos;s the one good thing about being a freshman .
i don &apos;t have to think about that this year .
mm , that and--and a lot of other things , it seems .
dan , you knew my focus was fixing things for ben .
i didn &apos;t realize i had an ultimatum .
you know , let &apos;s go inside . it &apos;s cold out .
hey , i , uh , i wanted to call , but she wouldn &apos;t let me .
are you telling me it &apos;s been a week ,
and you still can &apos;t get me five minutes alone with indra ?
she &apos;s only here for two days before
heading to chennai tomorrow . her schedule &apos;s packed .
oh , i &apos;ve always wanted to go to india .
can you get me a seat on her plane ?
or get me her itinerary .
it &apos;s being faxed over .
go , go , go , go .
make a decision , laurel ,
or i &apos;ll make the last one you &apos;ll hear .
got it .
what are you girls doing ?
just solidifying the details of my internship .
oh , honey , that reminds me .
i was thinking , why not work with me at waldorf designs ?
you love fashion .
well , i also love a good pot au feu ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m gonna build a career around it .
well , i have a @-@ a monster of a day .
do you know how many women would kill to work with your mother ?
yes ,
and they &apos;re the jenny humphreys of the world .
indra &apos;s itinerary .
ugh . this isn &apos;t hers , it &apos;s my mother &apos;s .
and indra &apos;s on it .
my mother &apos;s dressing her for a party this afternoon .
dorota !
well , mr . thorpe can &apos;t meet at noon ,
so you can push or you can cancel ,
whichever you prefer . thought so .
if i could impose on you to pop back up to the office
and tell mr . thorpe chuck bass is here to see him .
i &apos;ll take a coffee and today &apos;s &quot; pravda &quot;
if it &apos;ll be a few minutes .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
chuck bass .
i just flew in from new zealand ,
got the invitation to mr . thorpe &apos;s party .
thought i &apos;d stop by early to discuss business .
would you mind telling me what this is regarding ?
i don &apos;t usually expose my private matters
to assistants .
&quot; assistant &quot; ?
i prefer the term &quot; secretary , &quot; don &apos;t you ?
why not just call things as you see them ?
couldn &apos;t agree more .
so since i &apos;m sure your boss will see me ,
if you just tell him i &apos;m here--
that won &apos;t be possible .
let me save your job , sweetheart ,
and tell you why it is possible .
i &apos;m trying to block the potential sale
of bass industries , my dead father &apos;s legacy .
and since mr . thorpe and my father were business associates
when they were starting out , i &apos;m sure he &apos;d like
the opportunity to help me intervene .
i meant , that won &apos;t be possible
because mr . thorpe hasn &apos;t touched down from chicago yet .
and i probably shouldn &apos;t tell you this ,
but ...
i &apos;m listening .
in my position here , i &apos;m privy to certain information ,
and it appears you may be out of the loop .
the potential sale of bass industries is very real .
there &apos;s a deal on the table ,
and it &apos;s fast @-@ tracked to close in 24 hours .
i &apos;m guessing i &apos;ll be seeing you at my boss &apos; party later ?
i &apos;m sorry for ambushing you guys ,
but we need to start talking again ...
all of us .
dan , how &apos;s that internship search going ?
oh , that &apos;s right . maybe i can help .
i can call one of my friends at conde nast .
hmm . maybe you could , uh ,
forge your signature on the cover letter ?
serena .
this talking thing &apos;s going great .
what i wanna know is how many times
you got your hair done this week
while an innocent man sat in prison .
serena .
contrary to what you might believe ,
i &apos;m handling this in a way that is best for this family ,
and we &apos;re not gonna discuss it anymore .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna make sure she &apos;s okay .
and ...
i &apos;m not hungry anymore , so i &apos;ll see you at home .
she &apos;ll come around . just give her time .
thank you for trusting me .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m gonna go get our check and coats .
oh , judge stephens . hi .
um , i hope you enjoyed your time in the city ,
um , but you can return to the ranch now .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
crazy question ,
but why isn &apos;t ben just going after lily himself ?
because he knows she &apos;ll go to the cops
and tell them what juliet did to me .
oh , you mean kidnap and drug you ?
look , however wrong it was ,
enough harm has been done to their family by ours .
it &apos;s a lot to take on by yourself , that &apos;s all .
you know , i am tired ,
and this crusade has taken me away from other things .
well , you wanna go somewhere and talk ? or not talk ?
serena , a moment .
uh , now is not a good time .
unfortunately , time is why i &apos;m here .
unless we stop her , your mother is going to
sell bass industries in 24 hours .
i think i have a plan that can get us both what we want .
well , we &apos;ve waited this long .
what &apos;s a few more hours ?
sure . my interview &apos;s at 2 : 30 , so ...
okay , we &apos;ll meet at the waldorf &apos;s at 2 : 00
and then cab down there together .
watch your back , lily .
these kids are definitely not all right .
as i see it , we have two distinct goals .
i want to block the sale of bass industries ,
you want to get old ben out of jail .
yet , a single strategy may satisfy us both .
which is ?
blackmail .
but i can &apos;t pressure her unless i have hard evidence .
oh , while you were brunching ,
i took the liberty of checking the safe at the house .
did you know she has a safety deposit box
at the dorset bank on madison ?
no .
i know you &apos;ve spent your entire life
not wanting to become your mother , but ...
desperate times ...
you gettin &apos; soft , kid ?
no , i &apos;m getting bursitis .
that was mile nine . maybe we should head back .
i feel like i &apos;m 20 again .
i am 20 . i think i &apos;m gonna puke up a lung .
don &apos;t you have things to do ?
like what ?
something on your mind ?
just making sure
you &apos;re concentrating on the future , is all .
your terms of parole are pretty specific--a job , for one .
i know what the terms are ,
which was why my p.o. already has
an interview set up for me this afternoon .
really ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ? that &apos;s fantastic .
well , i thought it &apos;d be a nice surprise .
how about this ? after i get his job ,
what do you say i take you out to celebrate ?
i told chuck i &apos;m going to this thorpe party later .
russell thorpe ?
yeah . but you know what ?
a celebratory dinner sounds like a good after @-@ party .
maybe you could get an advance and pick up the check .
at the pay grade i &apos;m at ,
i hope you don &apos;t mind the halal cart .
uh , you look beat .
listen , uh ... i &apos;ll see you later , all right ?
yeah . sure .
excuse me . excuse me . excuse me .
i was wondering ...
elevator &apos;s coming up .
okay . thank god . showtime .
what are you doing here ?
hello to you , too .
i told you that it was just one movie on one ...
lonely holiday break . that &apos;s it .
no , i &apos;m here to see serena .
oh . well , she &apos;s not here to see you .
shocker .
where is she ?
uh , she &apos;s off scheming with chuck .
disguises are involved . it can &apos;t end well .
i &apos;ll wait . i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be back .
she knows i have an interview to get to .
you do know that &quot; powerful woman &quot;
is not actually a career , right ?
and neither is serena van der woodsen ,
but 10 bucks says that
you &apos;ll miss your interview waiting for her ... yet again .
10 bucks whatever harebrained scheme you &apos;re cooking up
blows up in your face , as per usual .
loitering lounge is upstairs .
already there , sister .
no , laurel .
go !
the schedule was not sent over .
look , i can &apos;t have the office falling apart now .
i am in over my head with fittings .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry about what i said earlier .
it was the stress talking .
i thought about it ,
and i really would love to intern with you .
really ?
well ... that is just great , dear .
and since you seem to have your hands full ,
i thought maybe i could accompany you ...
on your fittings for the midwestern mogul party .
well--well--well , perhaps , uh , it might be more efficient ,
uh , for you to have your own assignment
rather than accompanying me .
even better . why not--
patti blagojevich !
i &apos;m going to assume that that noise was a sneeze
and that you meant to say indra nooyi .
indra ? don &apos;t be silly .
she is a huge new client , and you are just an intern .
but ...
you can deliver this to patti
and you can style her .
god knows she needs it .
but--
darling , i am thrilled .
tell indra &apos;s people
that her eleanor waldorf fitting has been moved up a half @-@ hour .
relax . you &apos;re a spitting image .
remind me to kill you later for that .
the teller we need to talk to is named julie . she &apos;s new .
i &apos;d remember her .
and who do we say you are ? my son ?
is it weird hearing you say that actually turns me on ?
this better be worth the therapy .
let &apos;s get this over with .
yeah , hi , this is dan humphrey .
i am caught in some brutal traffic .
can i reschedule ?
no , i didn &apos;t realize he was deciding today or i ...
i wouldn &apos;t have put myself in this position .
okay . thank you .
will lonely boy ever learn that s. can &apos;t tell time ,
especially when she &apos;s wasting someone else &apos;s ?
all i have in my pile are divorce papers , jewelry ,
and artful nudes of my mother in her groupie days .
swap piles ?
i knew there would be nothing .
what did you expect to find in here , anyway ?
a gun . the smoking kind .
oh , my god . you found a copy of the affidavit .
any handwriting expert would be able to prove
that this is not mine .
not that we &apos;ll ever need to call one . the threat alone is enough .
looks like serena may have found
ben &apos;s get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
we have her .
you wanna make the call or should i ?
no .
later , in person .
i like the way you think , mom .
charles .
i assume you weren &apos;t upstairs playing rufus &apos; guitars .
if you didn &apos;t want me rooting around in the family safe ,
you should &apos;ve changed the combination .
well , i &apos;m just curious-- what were you hoping to find ?
a way to stop you from disposing
of the last remaining bit of my father .
is that what you think i &apos;m doing ?
why else would you be selling bass industries ?
because it &apos;s in trouble , charles .
what are you talking about ?
you read the papers . real estate , hotels ...
even in manhattan , no one &apos;s impervious .
why wouldn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i thought we could ride it out ,
refinance or something .
i was hoping i could turn it around
and wouldn &apos;t have to tell you , but then you disappeared .
and by the time you got back , it was an inevitability .
you expect me just to accept this , go on with my day ?
if i sell now , i can control how we sell it and to whom .
there &apos;s a private buyer that &apos;s made a very generous offer .
the company will stay intact , and so will your father &apos;s name .
and the money from the sale
will give you a chance to build a future .
and who knows ? maybe even buy it back someday .
but if this deal gets messed up--
bass industries will go to the highest bidder--
someone who &apos;ll fire the employees ,
cheapen the brand .
exactly . this buyer &apos;s committed to maintaining
the company &apos;s integrity , your father &apos;s integrity .
and i know he &apos;d want you to be a part of the next phase .
is it russell thorpe ?
you don &apos;t have to say . i know it &apos;s him .
the important thing is that you believe me
when i tell you i don &apos;t want your father &apos;s legacy to die .
i &apos;m trying to save what &apos;s left of it .
in 24 hours , you &apos;ll see ,
and hopefully serena will see some things , too .
yes , penelope ,
you will stand in the cold and hail me a cab .
call me when it &apos;s curbside .
and show some leg if you have to .
i &apos;m already late for indra .
is dan still here ?
no . he left 20 minutes ago . where were you ?
oh , i feel terrible about standing him up ,
but we found a copy of the affidavit .
b. , i think i can get ben out of prison .
what ? you didn &apos;t know him .
he was a good man before all this happened .
they &apos;re all good men before something happens to them , s.
some of them stay good ,
no matter how they &apos;re treated .
i thought you hated dan .
i do , so very much .
but whatever it is that you see in him ,
he seems to see in you as well .
i know you wanna focus on ben ,
but maybe you &apos;re avoiding your future ,
not fixing your past .
hey , i thought we were gonna meet up later .
we &apos;ll have to hit &quot; pause &quot; on that .
i think lily is trying to do the right thing .
by the company and by your inmate , too .
she said she &apos;ll prove it in 24 hours .
of course she did .
well , there &apos;s something i have to do anyway , so ...
one more day .
who is this russell thorpe exactly ?
his name sounds familiar .
oh . um ... he and bart started out in real estate
about the same time .
he ended up settling in chicago .
comes into town once a year , throws a garish party ...
so we all know he still exists .
i wish we didn &apos;t have to go , but ...
but nothing .
according to this invitation , it &apos;s gonna be a wingding .
why aren &apos;t you dressed ?
uh , shirt , pants ...
yeah , i &apos;m dressed .
look , i know you disapprove of me ,
but can &apos;t you please do so in a tuxedo ?
the sale of bass industries is in a very delicate stage .
and it &apos;s vital that
we at least present a unified family front .
fine . then it &apos;s just us .
hello ?
may i speak to mrs. humphrey , please ?
this is the concierge at the palace .
uh , yeah , she just left . can i take a message ?
it seems that
the guest mrs. humphrey was hosting , john stephens ,
left a pair of cufflinks in his room
when he checked out this morning .
um , i &apos;m sorry , you mean ... judge john stephens ?
dorota , have you seen the dress marked for indra nooyi ?
and--and what is patti blagojevich &apos;s dress still doing here ?
where is blair ?
no one is answering in her room , miss .
thus the reason i need your services .
now let &apos;s see that master key card of yours .
it &apos;s against hotel policy to open--
listen ... harvey ? ms. nooyi was expecting me .
so the silence on the other side of the door
could only mean one of two things .
either she neglected her appointment ,
which a woman of her professionalism
is not wont to do ,
or she &apos;s lying there ,
having choked on one of her own snack chips ,
while you &apos;re standing here quibbling about policy .
as i thought .
spotted--b . using old tricks to get to one nooyi .
ms. nooyi ?
indra ?
assistants ? anyone ?
but it seems that someone got an s.o.s. to the c.e.o.
sorry , b.
that internship has sailed .
hey .
nice tie . you changed it .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry .
i @-@ i swear i thought i would make it in time .
did you miss your interview ?
yeah , but it was my own fault .
for thinking you &apos;d show up on time .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i really can &apos;t get into this now .
i &apos;m on my way out .
where you going ?
well , james franco &apos;s giving a reading
of some of his short stories at housing works ,
and the writers house agent is gonna be there .
so i &apos;m gonna go and try to-- try to woo him .
the agent , not james franco .
well , why don &apos;t i go with you as your date ?
and then after you impress the hell out of the agent ,
we can have that talk .
well , you did come all the way to brooklyn to apologize ,
and you aren &apos;t dressed for a party , so ...
hold on . hey , eric . what &apos;s up ?
you know that judge stephens you were looking for ?
mom was hiding him at the palace while you were gone .
and guess when he checked out .
this morning , after brunch ?
hey , shall we ?
um , let me call you back .
yeah , i just need to make a quick detour first .
looks like serena &apos;s ablaze on a path to punishment .
suit up , lily .
your baby &apos;s out for blood .
why don &apos;t you get us some drinks ? i &apos;ll be just a minute .
all right .
hey . what are you doing here ?
i thought you went to brooklyn .
i did . dan came with me . have you seen chuck ?
no . have you seen indra nooyi ?
no .
oh , but i do see your mother ,
and she doesn &apos;t seem too happy to see you .
gotta go . bye .
hey . what are you doing here ? with your family ?
serena . you ?
i got a call this afternoon , so i &apos;m looking for my dad ,
who skipped a job interview he was required to go to
by his parole officer .
oh , and what did he skip it to do ?
eat a chicago superdawg ?
mr. bass .
looking dapper .
thank you ...
raina .
someone wanted to say hello .
mr. thorpe .
it &apos;s a pleasure to finally meet you , sir .
call me russell . i see you met my daughter .
raina thorpe .
wharton grad ,
thorpe enterprises &apos; vice president ,
and most trusted advisor to her proud and aging papa .
you said you were his assistant .
you said that . i said i prefer the term &quot; secretary , &quot;
which i do , for those whom it actually refers to .
raina never lies . it &apos;s her best quality .
i highly doubt that .
actually ...
i know it &apos;s premature , russell , but , uh , i came here to
shake the hand of the man who &apos;s buying bass industries .
what &apos;s that ?
i understand your need for discretion .
and while i wasn &apos;t happy the company was being sold ,
i was heartened to learn
that it would be my father &apos;s old friend at the helm .
son , uh , i &apos;m not the buyer .
and i was good friends with your father ...
until he kicked me out of every deal he could
and pushed me out of new york .
if i &apos;d known in time that his company was going up for sale ,
i would &apos;ve bought it cheap , dismantled it for parts ,
and hosted a fire sale .
dan ?
this party doesn &apos;t seem like your speed .
are you kidding ?
there are actually beers behind the bar i can pronounce .
no , i , uh , i &apos;m here with serena .
oh , she didn &apos;t tell me she was coming .
no , she wasn &apos;t , but eric called her ,
and ... here we are .
hi , mom . i , uh-- so sorry i &apos;m late ,
but i couldn &apos;t find my cufflinks ,
so i just-- i borrowed the ones
that judge stephens left at the palace .
uh , what &apos;s going on ?
dan , when you see serena ,
please tell her to stop whatever it is she &apos;s planning on
doing before she destroys our family .
i can &apos;t believe your nerve . what were you planning to do ,
lobby ms . nooyi for a job in the changing room ?
no , i was going to wait until after
meetings in underwear tend not to be taken seriously .
you would use me and jeopardize my business
to pursue a career you thought of five minutes ago
based on some power list ?
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you ,
but your dress was going to look stunning on her
no matter who zipped it up in the back .
i have to take my future into my own hands .
otherwise ...
otherwise what ?
you &apos;ll be forced to follow in my footsteps ?
no , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s fine , dear .
now that i realize that your childish games
are actually who you are and not a phase ,
i wouldn &apos;t want someone like you
wanting to be like me .
and you are fired .
there are you . what &apos;s wrong ?
let &apos;s just say my patience is as strained
as your mother &apos;s credibility .
ugh . what did she do ?
she misled me . the question is , why ?
you know why--
to serve her own best interests , always .
i found out that she paid off the judge twice--
once years ago to notarize my signature
and again recently to disappear
so that i couldn &apos;t hold him accountable .
you have the affidavit ?
let &apos;s go find my mom .
wait , i &apos;ve got a better idea .
we need to fire a warning shot .
that guy is a journalist for the &quot; post . &quot;
give it to him ,
tell him to ask questions . start with your mother .
that way she &apos;ll know we &apos;re serious .
hey , what are we doing here ?
just one more minute .
no , no more minutes .
i &apos;ll head off lily .
look , she can &apos;t keep getting away with this .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s not fair .
fair ? my agent meeting was important today .
it was my last shot .
i know , but you &apos;ll get another chance .
mm , no , i won &apos;t .
normal people don &apos;t get an endless number of chances
no matter the situation . that &apos;s just you .
whatever it is you &apos;re planning to do ,
is it worth it ?
or are you gonna walk out the door with me right now ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it seems like love can &apos;t compete
with the allure of war .
find your seats , honored guests .
justice is served .
serena , what &apos;s in the envelope
you just gave the &quot; post &quot; reporter ?
that is a copy of the affidavit .
so you can have judge stephens release ben ...
and cancel the sale of bass industries .
if not , i &apos;ll tell the reporter the truth ,
and the &quot; post &quot; will have a cover story .
excuse me , this what i think it is ?
there &apos;s an explanation .
no need . i get it .
i know how bad the job market is these days .
what ?
can you please tell this dan humphrey that while i &apos;m very flattered ,
i don &apos;t have the power to hire anyone .
print &apos;s a dying medium .
he switched the envelopes .
hmm . that &apos;s my boy .
i need a drink .
my son was actually looking for an internship , not a job .
what in the hell were you trying to do ?
get ben out of prison , mom .
what , by putting me in ?
i wasn &apos;t gonna press charges against you .
well , it wouldn &apos;t be your choice .
it would be the district attorney &apos;s .
the information about ben and the affidavit
can never get out , ever .
now can you just trust me when i say i &apos;m handling it ?
hey , i still have some friends in this town ,
and some of them are at this party .
why are you so upset ?
because you skipped your job interview today , dad .
lucky for you , i covered .
i told your p.o. you twisted your ankle on our jog .
got him to reschedule it for tomorrow .
nate , i went to the damn interview , okay ?
i walked into that waiting room in my suit and tie ,
and i realized i was there to beg for a janitor &apos;s job ...
along with half a dozen other ex @-@ cons
who probably don &apos;t have a high school education .
do you know how that makes me feel ?
not good , i &apos;m guessing .
i mean here to reignite some old business connections ,
to remind people that before everything that went down ,
i used to be good at what i did .
i &apos;m gonna make you proud of me , i promise .
that &apos;s what you said right before you got caught .
i thought i saw you storm out of here ten minutes ago .
well , on top of everything else , they can &apos;t find my coat .
so it doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure out
that your sorry scheme blew up in your face . you owe me $ 10 .
and serena disappointed you twice today , so you owe me $ 20 .
coat checker !
what &apos;s wrong ? it &apos;s not the coat .
i &apos;m sorry . are we friends ?
of course not .
here you go , sir .
oh , excellent . thank you .
here you are .
i had a horrible fight with my mother .
i tried to be indra nooyi ,
and while i admit that choice may have been a bit random ,
the other choice was to be my mother , and i didn &apos;t want that .
why not ?
you care about fashion
more than most people care about , uh ... well , anything .
you used to send girls home crying from constance
for wearing tights as pants .
well , somebody had to . it was for the greater good ,
just like my suggestion that you take off that tie
and shove it in your pocket right now .
you &apos;re an evil dictator of taste , blair .
why deny that just because it &apos;s what your mother does ?
and by the way , this tie was my grandfather &apos;s .
if only he &apos;d been buried in it .
i didn &apos;t lie to you , charles .
are you familiar with the sin of omission ?
you seemed calmed by the idea of thorpe as the buyer ,
and i needed to keep things smooth for another 24 hours
so that this deal would close without incident ,
but it looks like i failed .
the buyer just called .
somehow , he heard about the scene that just transpired ,
the little war between me and my children ,
and he &apos;s backing out .
over a family squabble ?
all he had to do was hear that you and i were in a standoff .
and now he &apos;s concerned that there would be problems
between us every step of the acquisition .
so ... my father &apos;s life &apos;s work
is heading for the auction block ?
pray it goes to someone who doesn &apos;t chop it up .
thank you , all , for coming , and , uh , a special thanks
to the folks who came in from chicago ,
uh , where we &apos;ve enjoyed a great run .
but ... a wise man once told me ,
&quot; if you stay in one place long enough ,
you &apos;ll never go anywhere . &quot;
which is why my daughter and i
are very pleased to announce
that thorpe enterprises is packing up and moving east
to new york city .
i was planning to get settled before i dove into business ,
but i &apos;m a restless man .
so i &apos;ve decided to set my sights high on a company
that has just this minute come back up on the block--
my dear departed friend &apos;s bass industries .
looks like &quot; page six &quot; of this party will read ,
&quot; the world according to thorpe . &quot;
so ... cheers to new friends
and inevitable enemies .
forget your usual suspects , upper east siders .
i look forward to facing you all .
cheers .
there &apos;s a new family in town .
come to twist the knife further ?
you were right .
i used you ...
and i shouldn &apos;t have . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i @-@ i &apos;ve watched you struggling to find your path ,
and i guess i just hoped that you would want to follow mine .
but like any self @-@ respecting daughter
with an egocentric mother ...
would be repelled by the thought of being anything like her .
that is not true .
uh , mother , you are brilliant
and resilient .
and ... a businesswoman
and an artist .
i &apos;d be crazy not to want to be like you .
really ?
but you are not a designer .
you are a , um ...
a dictator of taste .
exactly . i love that .
who said that ?
a friend of mine .
well , if only there was a person who did that for a living ,
someone for you to aspire to ,
there is .
editrix of a high fashion magazine .
so we &apos;ll strategize in the morning ?
i realized i didn &apos;t really need to be in possession of this .
thank you , i guess .
i would say i &apos;m sorry about today ,
but in my head , that just sounds inadequate .
nah , you don &apos;t need to apologize .
it &apos;s not your fault that i seem to drop everything
just to make myself available to you .
i don &apos;t mean to take you for granted .
it &apos;s just , if we &apos;re being completely honest ...
we are .
i think that maybe sometimes i test you .
you know , i keep thinking that if things get too hard ,
you &apos;ll give up on me , but you never do .
and i never will .
if you really need me ever , i am there ,
but i think there &apos;s a reason you didn &apos;t insist
i come with you over break .
and why you didn &apos;t try to make me stay ?
so where does that leave us ?
with one last shot .
if we ever do jump in again , that &apos;ll be it .
we either sink or swim . we won &apos;t get another chance .
and when that time comes ,
we better make damn sure we &apos;re ready .
yeah . we should .
nate , i can &apos;t talk right now .
yes , you can .
your parole officer just called me
&apos;cause he didn &apos;t know where you were again .
dad , if you don &apos;t get a job soon ,
they &apos;re gonna send you back to prison .
kid , i &apos;m at an interview right now .
yeah , at this time of night ?
sure , dad . whatever you say .
sorry about that . just my son .
anyway , you were saying ?
well , i &apos;ve been gone for a while , and , uh ,
we &apos;ve been hard @-@ pressed to find just the right financial guy
to introduce us to n.y.c.
i know you &apos;ve still got a lot of friends , family connections .
what do you think ?
in the new year ,
we resolve to do things we &apos;ve only dreamed of doing ...
and not to do other things ever again .
i hope your visits don &apos;t become a habit , humphrey .
don &apos;t worry . i don &apos;t think
you &apos;ll be seeing me around here for a while .
heading home to brooklyn ?
no . actually , i was gonna catch
&quot; monsieur hulot &apos;s holiday &quot; at the walter reade .
try to cheer myself up .
oh . well , i do enjoy myself some tati .
though i suppose if you &apos;re trying to improve your mood
that my coming with you would defeat that purpose .
it is pretty funny . even you couldn &apos;t
kill that much comedy .
i still require you to sit two seats away .
works for me . keeps your paws off my popcorn .
wait here while i change .
we may surprise ourselves as we face the future ...
or be surprised when cleaning up the past .
hi . i &apos;m here to see ben donovan .
i know it &apos;s late , but i really need to talk to him .
i &apos;m sorry . you just missed him . mr. donovan was released .
what ? how ?
his parole was moved up by a judge stephens .
when did this happen ?
says here the paperwork was filed a couple days ago ,
just went through this evening .
so russell thorpe seems nice .
oh , my god . it &apos;s not just his disloyalty or deviousness .
it &apos;s his pomposity .
and the fact that you slept with him ?
how did you kn--
i remembered where i knew the name .
it &apos;s from the time when we exchanged our lists .
oh , well , it was a long time ago , and it was fleeting .
just when you thought
you &apos;d escaped another major scandal today ...
dishonesty may help some make a few good amends ...
while others are left to wonder if they can handle the truth .
what are you doing here ?
riverpark &apos;s one of the only bars i like in new york .
and i came to offer you an apology .
today at the office , the identity game--
i &apos;m usually more straightforward than that ,
which leads me to my next point .
edge of my seat .
my father reported
your family &apos;s fight to the buyer during the party .
scared him off so he could go after it himself .
while i &apos;m impressed with your honesty ,
i can &apos;t say i like the information
or your relationship to it .
it &apos;s just business .
right now i &apos;m trying to focus on whatever pleasure i can .
if you can separate the two , so can i.
my car is just outside .
i &apos;ll wait five minutes before taking off .
if i go home alone ,
i &apos;ll never bring it up again .
and whether you kick things off by sleeping with the enemy
or trying your best to remake a former friend ...
serena .
you &apos;re still here .
just waiting for the bus .
what are you even doing here ?
are you free for coffee ?
i &apos;m free for anything .
one thing &apos;s for sure--
anything is possible .
