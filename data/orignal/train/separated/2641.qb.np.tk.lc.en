she &apos;s a fugitive wanted in connection
with the murder of 14 c.i.a. agents , a u.s. senator ,
and the attorney general of the united states .
they &apos;ll set a perimeter .
yes .
capitol police , park police , m.p.d.c ..
we &apos;ll never make it out of the city .
no . that &apos;s why we &apos;re not gonna even try .
we believe she may have an accomplice .
the most elusive fugitive in the history of the bureau ,
raymond reddington .
i want every camera in this city looking for these two .
every twitter feed , every instagram account ,
every reddit thread .

have they passed through the 3rd street tunnel ?
two minutes out . i dispatched a chopper .
okay , we got a sighting , 395 north .
i want m.p.d.c. to run a traffic break
and barricade all exits off the 3rd street tunnel .
seal it up .
you &apos;ll need to put that on .
okay , chopper feed is live .
we have a visual .
confirm we have a tail team in place
and that all exits are blocked south of 3rd .
you agree with me , right ?

they can &apos;t just disappear .
well , it is mr. reddington .

where &apos;s charlene ?
i ordered them to take these off .
where is my wife ?
read charlene &apos;s statement .
is it true what tom connolly did to you ?
he made me think i was dying .
ordered a phony clinical trial that made me believe
he was my only hope
so the cabal could manipulate me .
if i were you , i &apos;d want him dead .
you think i had something to do with it ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
that i helped agent keen kill the attorney general .
i begged her not to do it . i ordered her not to .
why ?
because connolly had a plan to bring down everyone .
not just elizabeth , but samar , aram ...
you .
all that matters is that keen &apos;s a fugitive ,
and i &apos;m gonna bring her in .
you &apos;re not holding charlene
because she leaked classified information to a reporter .
you &apos;re holding her because it gives you leverage with me .
does it ?
i told agent keen to run .
you want to know if i &apos;m complicit ?
i told her to run .
you &apos;re in charge now , agent ressler .
and being in charge means you have to decide
what to do with information like that .
now , let my wife go .
who &apos;s this ?
my sister tiffany .
tiffany lives in denver .
i did until last month .
her husband passed .
she needed to get out .
red , you know me .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss , tiffany .
what is this place ?
this is where we wait for the troll farmer .
the who ?
we &apos;re getting a little ahead of ourselves .
he won &apos;t be ready for at least a week .
ready for what ?
actually , a week may be nice .
i &apos;ll finally get the time to catch up
on some back issues of &quot; bassmaster . &quot;
♬ bye , bye , baby bunting ♬
♬ daddy &apos;s gone a @-@ hunting ♬
♬ bye , bye ba-- ♬
♬ hunting to get a little rabbit skin ♬
♬ to put his baby bunting ♬
put her down . who are you ?
what a lovely child .
she is the perfect little angel , aren &apos;t we , elle ?
put her down .
such fragile creatures , these tiny humans .
skull &apos;s like ... eggshells .
who &apos;s her favorite friend ?
should we take along mr. panda or mr. dinosaur ?
what do you want ?
i want your father . i &apos;ll text instructions .
mr. panda , i think .
update now to our top story , even as authorities allege
agent keen committed these acts of terror on behalf of russia ,
various papers are reporting that russia is not responsible .
now , according to leaked documents ,
one of the alleged leaders of this organization
is the cia &apos;s director ...
you released the contents of the fulcrum to the press .
... just moments ago came forward
to address these reports .
good afternoon . my name is peter kotsiopulos , ‬
and i am the cia &apos;s director of national clandestine services .
in the 65 years since this division has been created ,
the director &apos;s identity
has never been revealed during his tenure .
but today , the president has agreed
to let me speak openly to you so that i may address
the irresponsible accusations
that not only seek to defame me ,
but are harmful to our national security .
did you expect him to just come forward ?
... part of a conspiracy are preposterous .
i wasn &apos;t sure what to expect .
they are based upon information
provided by raymond reddington ,
a traitor to our country and a fugitive
who is helping ex @-@ fbi special agent
elizabeth keen avoid arrest .
the daughter of a notorious kgb spy ,
keen is a wanted terrorist .
my accusers are criminals ,
the subject of one of the largest manhunts ever conducted .
who are you going to believe is telling the truth ?
if i didn &apos;t know any better , i &apos;d believe him .
but you do know better .
they &apos;re gonna believe i &apos;m a russian spy .
my mother was a russian spy .
it doesn &apos;t matter that i never knew her .
it &apos;s the perfect story .
i &apos;m the perfect patsy .
we have to be patient .
patient ?
do you have any idea the kind of resources
they &apos;re throwing at us right now , the manpower ?
this city -- - this city is impossible to get out of now .
we have no chance of crossing
the perimeter they &apos;ve established .
but washington d.c. cannot sustain a siege .
the economy , the government , one week , two at the most ,
and the city will be back to normal .
that &apos;s when we travel .
people will go on believing i &apos;m a terrorist .
check the surveillance feeds
from the hotel where connolly was shot .
we already have .
check again .
i want to know exactly what role cooper played .
dcfd is responding
to a vehicle fire in columbia heights .
it looks like the transport vehicle
used by mr. reddington &apos;s people .
any signs of keen or reddington ?
nope . we &apos;ll try and recover
the vin numbers on the transport
and any vehicles it may have been carrying ,
but right now , the fire &apos;s too hot ,
so it looks like they got away .
which is , you know , terrible news .
none of us want to be in this position , but we are .
our job is to catch them .
so , i need you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you can do that .
i can .
yes .
if you can look me in the eye
and promise me agent keen
will get a fair hearing if we do .
i can try .
come on , that &apos;s not good enough .
it &apos;s the best i can do .
let me know as soon as you find out anything on cooper .
what a jerk .
sorry .
he &apos;s simply gathering the facts .
yeah , well , there &apos;s only one fact about mr. cooper that matters --
he &apos;s a decent man .
d.c. field office just called .
they got a tip on keen &apos;s whereabouts .
mateus , i didn &apos;t expect to see you here .
peter .
you said mr. reddington
did not have the fulcrum in his possession .
you said it was a bluff .
a ploy .
you were wrong .
and now our plans have been sorely compromised .
our plans ? they &apos;re my plans .
they were .
now they &apos;re nothing .
i would advise you to think very carefully
before you use that tone with me ever again .
i pine for the days when conquered generals
had the sense and good taste to fall on their swords .
now they hold press conferences ,
negotiate advances for their memoirs
while the rest of us clean up their messes .
i &apos;m not leaving this to others .
i have every agency within homeland
working around the clock
to find reddington and keen .
i don &apos;t think you understand , peter .
i &apos;m here because people in our organization
have lost confidence in you , in your methods .
there &apos;s a history here , so i take no joy in telling you
that you &apos;re dancing on the edge of a razor blade ,
and that every breath that you draw is at our discretion .
this reminds me of sok pich .
we were navigating the backwaters in western cambodia
hoping to steal some sapphires from a mine foreman .
got as far as pailin when the monsoon struck .
took shelter in a root cellar of all places .
i &apos;ve never seen so much rain .
winds like a monarch gone mad .
all we could do was hunker down and wait it out .
but sok ... he just made a run for the village .
so , there i was soaking wet , alone .
three days of absolute misery .
and then on the fourth day ,
i was overcome
by this incredible feeling of ... peace .
something about being hidden there underground
while the rest of the world was being torn apart outside .
this isn &apos;t making me feel better .
you have every right to be afraid .
just don &apos;t let it control you .
poor sok learned that the hard way .
what happened to him ?
he died .
didn &apos;t get six steps before the wind
blew a blade of lemongrass into his skull .
you &apos;re in a storm , lizzy .
you need to find the peace below the winds .
do you know who that woman is ?
told you it doesn &apos;t matter .
she &apos;s a terrorist !
tiff , listen !
if you say a word , if you so much as whisper this to --
what have you done ?
red , i @-@ i can control this .
your phone .
you &apos;ve reached the federal bureau of investigation &apos;s
major case contact center .
what did you tell them ?
you can go screw yourself , pal , okay ?
my husband was a soldier .
he died fighting for this country , trying to protect us
from people like her !
tiff , shut the hell up !
you and i are finished .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re leaving .
within seconds , agents are gonna breach this building .
they &apos;re gonna want to speak to you
because you called in the tip .
get rid of them , or your brother dies .
downstairs .
fbi ! fbi !
hands ! hands !
show me your hands .
raymond reddington and elizabeth keen .
you need to tell me where they are right now .
fugitives ? the one -- the one &apos;s on tv ?
tiffany lepman , right ?
yeah . you think they &apos;re here ?
we got an anonymous tip from your phone
saying they were here .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i haven &apos;t called anyone .
harboring a fugitive is a felony .
you lie to me again , you &apos;re going to jail .
where are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
second floor clear !
look , if i knew something , i &apos;d say .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to the fbi .
sir , we &apos;re all clear .
aram .
tip call that came in , call her back .
double @-@ check the information .
thank you for your time .
look , i told you , if i knew anything , i --
cuff her !
look at the floor .
keen , i know you &apos;re down there .
look , there &apos;s two ways this ends .
you come up hands raised or we come down guns raised .
your call .
hands !
fbi ! fbi !
show me your hands !
on the ground !
where are they ?
no .
seems a bit indiscrete .
porsche carrera .
two @-@ seater suggests no family .
price tag indicates he &apos;s wealthy enough to live alone ,
maybe a girlfriend .
if he &apos;s here , it &apos;s likely his apartment is empty .
the address will be on the registration
in the glove compartment .
daddy .
what did he look like ?
black , he was tall .
what did he say he wants ?
you .
he says he wants my father .
papi , he was holding her , and then he --
isabella , look at me .
isabella , i will find her .
i will get her back .
you said the plan was to wait ,
搜捕仍在继续
that it was impossible to cross the perimeter .
waiting was an option when we had somewhere to wait .
now we don &apos;t .
we need to contact the troll farmer .
but i don &apos;t know who that is .
the troll f--
what do you think ?
the troll farmer uses social media
to conduct highly coordinated disinformation campaigns
on behalf of governments , lobbyists ,
corporations , crime syndicates ,
and on occasion , a humble fugitive .
he &apos;s mastered the art of information warfare
by creating events , virtual hoaxes
designed to piggyback on real public anxiety .
he activates hundreds of fake accounts
to post thousands of tweets , creating the appearance of ,
say , a terrorist attack in paris
that served as cover for an art heist .
he doctors screenshots from news outlets
to report an ebola outbreak in atlanta
in order to drive up the stock of a drug company
developing a cure .
the troll farmer is much more than a rumor monger .
the events he creates appear to be real
and provoke a very real response .
smoke manufactured
to draw the cameras away from the real fire .
she was blonde .
my mother .
that picture in your apartment -- she was blonde .
i look like her , don &apos;t i ?
we are out of time .
is she alive ?
hello .
raymond , elizabeth , and you are ?
martha .
martha .
please -- please don &apos;t hurt me .
no , no , no , no .
we &apos;re not gonna hurt you , martha .
we are , however , going to take your cellphone
and lock you in the bathroom , okay ?
okay .
i must say , your hair ,
the way it frames your face is very becoming .
gracias .
de nada .
i reviewed every witness statement
and the surveillance from the hotel .
there &apos;s nothing to indicate that cooper was complicit
in connolly &apos;s death or in liz &apos;s escape .
thank god .
he wasn &apos;t complicit , but you were .
you asked me to see if cooper helped liz .
he had two opportunities to do that --
in the hotel where connolly was shot
and here in the war room where she escaped .
she got out by cutting the power .
we found a traffic camera
that shows her exiting the building at 11 : 22 .
yeah , from the service corridor
where i found her phone .
cameras came back online in the war room at 11 : 23 .
that &apos;s 60 seconds only you can account for .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i think you let her go .
i think this way that you &apos;re acting , this anger ,
it &apos;s because you think it &apos;s your fault .
you trusted her
and she turned around and murdered the attorney general .
i &apos;m angry because our country was attacked .
we &apos;re all angry .
but i know there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me ,
and whatever it is , whatever instinct is keeping you
from admitting the truth , i don &apos;t trust it .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m not supposed to see you for another seven days .
there &apos;s been a change of plans .
i don &apos;t change plans .
not for you , not for anybody .
this is him ? this is the troll farmer ?
perhaps i should &apos;ve told you he doesn &apos;t like that name .
i need a week .
you &apos;ve got an hour .
we &apos;re out of time , chang .
you need to get us out of the city today .
the understanding was
that you were going to stay underground for a week .
that was the contract .
i &apos;ve had you on retainer for over three years .
your content providers have all my pertinent files .
you &apos;re not the problem , mr. reddington .
my programmers are scrambling to build content for your plus one .
she &apos;s the wrinkle here .
today .
oh , my god . you &apos;re ...
they said i would be doubling .
they were gonna take pictures ,
but i had no idea it was ... you .
who are you ?
i guess i &apos;m you .
elizabeth keen , right ?
is he here , too ?
reddington ? are you with him now ?
i don &apos;t mean to pry , but how does it feel ?
how does what feel ?
to be a fugitive .
3rd street tunnel is still shut down .
news teams , camera crews , choppers overhead .
anywhere near capitol hill ,
the mall , union station will be flooded with cameras , too .
capitol hill is no fly .
we might be able to use that to our advantage .
what about tunnels under dupont circle ?
be a good escape route .
we don &apos;t want to contend with capitol police .
what do we know about the perimeter ?
how close can we get ?
city is blanketed with traffic cameras and cctv .
very few blind spots .
okay , okay . talk to me about liabilities .
twitter , snapchat , reddit .
i want addresses , hotspots where a sighting
is most likely to blow up on social .
give us about a 20 % chance of pulling this off .
chin up , chang .
believe in yourself and others will , too .
what is that , another one of your dumbass literary quotes ?
fortune cookie .
you had them and they got away ?
chased them out of hiding .
reddington had a plan , now he doesn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a win .
terror alert has been elevated to severe .
there is no win in that .
perimeter &apos;s 200 blocks .
we &apos;re turning over 10 blocks an hour .
won &apos;t be long now .
i &apos;ve had to brief the white house .
they know you were keen &apos;s partner .
that &apos;s an advantage .
i agree .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve risked my career to back you .
don &apos;t make me regret doing that .
spoke with main justice .
charlene &apos;s being released .
no charges are gonna be filed at this time .
thank you .
and you &apos;re being released , pending further investigation .
apparently justice wasn &apos;t informed
that i advised agent keen to run .
apparently not .
glad to know you don &apos;t think i was complicit .
i do think you were complicit .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
&apos;cause they didn &apos;t ask .
besides , i &apos;m complicit , too .
when keen , uh ... when she broke out of interrogation ,
i caught up to her .
i could &apos;ve stopped her .
i mean , i should &apos;ve stopped her , but i didn &apos;t .
i let her go .
because i did , the attorney general is dead .
that &apos;s a blessing .
a blessing ? murder ?
that &apos;s something reddington would say , not you .
you made a decision based on instinct .
you should trust that .
my job isn &apos;t to trust my gut .
my job is to uphold the law .
i intend to do that .
when i was a little girl ,
i used to imagine that my mother was a prima ballerina
who danced for kings and queens
in london and paris .
and she only left me with sam
until she could come home again
and sweep me away .
i never would &apos;ve imagined .
what happened to her ?
my mother .
there was a time in my life when i was quite sure
i knew exactly what happened to katarina rostova .
but after all these years , i &apos;m not sure
i have any real sense of how or ...
why she disappeared .
everyone talks as if she was a terrible person .
was she ?
okay , we &apos;re as ready as we &apos;re gonna be .
either you &apos;ll be free within the hour
or you &apos;ll be arrested and tried for treason .
think we got something .
picked it up online . twitter photo .
posted it two minutes ago ,
taken in the shaw neighborhood at 9th and q.
area &apos;s controlled by the 18th street gang .
if they &apos;re there , it &apos;s for protection .
call vice . i want the location of all known safe houses .
roll all units . this ends now .
fbi !
fbi !
against the wall !
i got your girl .
i swear i &apos;ll kill her .
i &apos;m not playing with you .
all clear . they &apos;re not here .
you hear me , cop ? i said i got your girl .
vans are here .
vans ? we &apos;re splitting up ?
yes .
why ?
because it doubles the odds
that one of us will make it out to clear your name .
i &apos;ll fulfill the contract ,
but after this , no more , you hear me ?
you , this , too much of a liability .
ready ?
yeah .
you &apos;re crazy , old man .
you have no idea .
you didn &apos;t have a shot . you could have missed .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t .
you were lucky . i was lucky you were lucky .
i said before i didn &apos;t trust your instincts .
now they scare me .
okay , i &apos;ve got something . a call to the tip line .
a cctv feed and three tweets all indicating
mr. reddington and agent keen are moving north / northwest
on foxhall road past reservoir .
roll a swat team over to georgetown foxhall road .
hang on , i have a sighting in adams morgan .
wait , wait , no . what ?
aram , talk to me .
okay , msnbc &apos;s home page
just uploaded video of them at michigan park .
hold on , this can &apos;t be right .
what ? - all right , my screen -- my screen &apos;s blowing up here .
i &apos;ve got them in brookmont ,
but the tip line has them in palisades .
what the hell is going on ?
i have no idea .
i &apos;ve got them in five different parts of the city
all at the same time .
well , that &apos;s interesting because cnn
is quoting the head of the criminal division saying
they &apos;ve been captured in kalorama heights .
wait , is that true ?
of course it &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m the head of the criminal division .
aram .
dispatch rolling units to all these sightings .
uh , yes , rolling all available agencies .
uh , mr. reddington and agent keen
can &apos;t be in all of these places ,
but they must be in one of them .
or maybe they &apos;re not .
that &apos;s what reddington wants us to think .
he wants us to divert all our manpower to the south .
it &apos;s a diversion .
redirect all the units to the checkpoints
along the northern perimeter .
that &apos;s where they &apos;re gonna be .
thought i heard on the radio
they caught the two you &apos;re looking for .
all units be advised , suspects are in custody .
repeat , suspects are in custody .
all units please stand down .
we got a problem .
give me your phone .
lizzy .
they know .
where are you ?
i made it through , but you won &apos;t .
you have to turn back right now .
turn back where ? there &apos;s nowhere --
what are you doing ?
getting you out of here .
where are you going ?
lizzy , listen to me . take a breath .
you can do this .
what ? what am i gonna do ?
i &apos;m outside the perimeter ,
and i won &apos;t be able to get back to you in time ,
so you &apos;re on your own .
you need to find a place to hide ,
someplace where they cannot get to you .
i can &apos;t .
katarina rostova was the cleverest ,
most resourceful woman i have ever known .
what are you saying ?
no matter how dark the moment ,
she could always find her way through .
she was a russian spy who i never knew .
no , you didn &apos;t .
but that doesn &apos;t mean your mother is gone .
i see her in you every day .
she &apos;s as much a part of you as the air you breathe .
i can &apos;t do this .
you can .
you must .
2650 wisconsin avenue .
no . lizzy , no , no , no .
it &apos;s the only chance i &apos;ve got .
2650 wisconsin avenue . get there now .
where is she ?
kudos , donald . i &apos;m impressed .
what do you want ?
to give you a blacklister .
i &apos;ll pass .
the diversion that allowed me to slip past your perimeter ,
the man who orchestrated that cooked it up in under an hour .
he &apos;s an illusionist essential to criminals such as myself ,
and i am giving him to you .
where &apos;s keen ?
you said you got past the perimeter .
you wouldn &apos;t be calling unless she didn &apos;t .
no , she didn &apos;t .
but i &apos;m not telling you
anything you don &apos;t know already , donald .
i &apos;m sure by now you found the vehicle
that was transporting her .
so , that &apos;s what this is about ?
you knowing that i &apos;ll find her
and giving me a blacklister in exchange for when i do .
no . it &apos;s not a trade or a bribe
or an offer of payment in kind
to entice you to look away .
i admire your probity too much for that .
so , what do you want ?
&apos;cause you only give to get .
all i want is your word as a man of honor .
my word .
you know elizabeth .
you know she &apos;s not a russian spy
or a traitor or a terrorist .
you know that &apos;s not who she is .
doesn &apos;t matter what i know .
if you catch her , it will .
it will matter a great deal .
what you know about her ,
what you feel about her could make all the difference .
so , my offer .
one blacklister in exchange for your word
that you will give her the benefit of every doubt .
can you do that , donald ?
can you give me your word ?
yes .
his name is bo chang .
65 east goethe .
bo chang . got it .
hey , reddington .
i will find you .
you know , as my father used to say to me ,
just because you &apos;ve been bumped up
to first chair in the orchestra
doesn &apos;t mean you can compose a symphony .
hello ?
open the door .
dear , your daughter &apos;s life depends on it .
oh , my god !
no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t touch her . not yet .
take a picture of her with your phone .
what ?
take a picture of your daughter
and send it to this number , please .
chop , chop .
very good , dear .
thank you for your cooperation .
you returned her . why ?
because your reputation precedes you , mr. zuma .
there was no doubt ...
you would do whatever was necessary
to affect your granddaughter &apos;s release .
you ...
are a man of your word .
give me one reason why i should not kill you .
because if you do kill me ,
then your granddaughter will not receive
the antidote to the time @-@ released nerve agent
we introduced into her digestive track .
and inside of ... three weeks ,
will suffer an agonizing death .
what do you want ?
i want you ...
to breathe ...
very deeply .
♬ the system &apos;s in red ♬
♬ the room is inbred ♬
♬ i &apos;m a go getter ♬
♬ don &apos;t hold no harm ♬
♬ don &apos;t hold ♬
all checkpoints just reported in .
