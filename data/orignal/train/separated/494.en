The Itch
你来了吗
Text Jessica.
Ok. What would you like to say to Jessica?
On my way.
Don't leave without me.
Your text to Jessica says
"On highway. Car keys and tai chi."
Ready to send it?
Cancel. Cancel.
Cancel.
Text Jessica.
Ok. What would you like to say to Jessica?
I am almost there. Period.
Are you ready to go? Period--
Uh, question mark!
Your text to Jessica says
"Lost my hair. Are you ready to go on your period?"
Ready to send it?
No! no.
Hey, buddy!
Hey! Come on. Get out of the road!
Hey, get out of the street, man.
Come on, there's--
Come on, you gotta be careful, man.
There's cars comin'. Come on.
Hey. Get off me!
Slow down, slow down!
Get out of the road!
I know. There's a guy running across the street.
Hey, no, no, wait! Hey, come back.
Come back, wait!
Get them off me!
Get them off me! Get them off me!
Wait!
Bone up on your manners and your Vitamin C deficiencies, crime tigers,
because we are going to the peachtree capital of America,
Atlanta, Georgia.
What's in Atlanta?
Local P.D. has invited us in for an equivocal death investigation.
This is Albert Stillman.
He is an investigative journalist for a local paper.
3 days ago he disappeared
on his way to talk to a source for a story,
and last night he was killed wandering into traffic.
Wait. Equivocal death means we help determine
homicide versus suicide, right?
Or death by misadventure.
My point. So what happened to Mr. Stillman was tragic,
but what's to equivocate?
I mean, he had some sort of mental break, end of story.
Except that he had no history of mental illness.
Could this have been drug induced?
Maybe. One of his most recent stories
was an expose on an inner city drug ring,
and he received death threats for that one.
Dealers wouldn't let him loose in traffic, though.
If somebody wanted him killed, why not just shoot him?
We have to reconstruct his life to answer that question.
Reporters like Stillman don't just snap.
Something or someone drove him insane.
If you didn't put it there, who would, then?
Somebody else did. You have the wrong guy.
Who put it there?
If you didn't do it, who did it?!
You have the wrong guy.
Who did it, Albert?
I don't know.
Who did it? You want me to be...
Why don't you let me go?
Is that what you want?
No, I don't. Come on--
I don't want to see anything.
You see it.
You see it. You know.
Why don't you let me go.
You know. You know.
And we find out who did this to you.
I'll go with you to find out who did it to you, ok?
It's right here. This is where it goes. See it?
Answer the question. You see it. You see it.
No, I don't see it. I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
Please, let me go.
Ohh! What is it?
Dear God! It's--
It's--it's--
I see it.
I see it!
I see it! I see it! I see it!
I see it!
"What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
"that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourself scabs?"
William Shakespeare.
You can see why Albert Stillman was nominated for awards.
He wrote pieces on homeless children,
police corruption,
bankrolling local strip clubs.
My kind of muckraker. Fights for the little guy.
Those are also the kind of stories
that put him in harm's way, though. Any one of them
could have gotten him killed.
It doesn't fit this M.O., though.
We need to consider the likelihood that there is no unsub,
that whatever happened to Stillman
could have just been an accident.
What do we know about the source he was going to see
the night he disappeared?
Oy, I have an update on that, mademoiselle.
I have been talking and working with Atlanta P.D.'s
perfectly lovely I.T. expert.
"perfectly lovely" is code for not as good as you, right, baby girl?
Moi, throw shade? Never.
Let's just say with a lot of my help,
we've managed to narrow down the possibilities
to a throwaway cell that called him
hours before his disappearance.
So it's a dead end, then.
Yeah, and not the only one.
Stillman's editor has dealt us an "aw, come on" surprise
by filing an injunction to halt the autopsy of the recently deceased body.
But we have jurisdiction here. That's pointless.
And suspicious. Thanks, Garcia.
All right, when we land, Kate and I will go talk to the editor,
find out what he's hiding.
Dave, you and Morgan re-interview the witness
who tried to save Stillman's life.
And Reid and JJ, let's move forward with the M.E.
We're not going to let an injunction stop the investigation.
So...
Thanks.
Did he say anything else to you besides "get off me"?
No, he just--just kind of screamed it
over and over and over.
What else was he doing?
I don't know, man, the guy was a schizo.
Ok, I hear you. But any details you can give us
about what he was saying or how he was saying it
might help us figure out what happened to him.
The whole time, he was... hitting the air.
Like he was fighting someone?
Yeah. Except I don't think it was someone,
I think it was something.
A lot of somethings,
because right before he...
you know...
He looked right at me and he said...
get them off me!
"Them."
You think he said "get them off me"?
Yeah, I think so.
What do you think it was?
I don't know.
But it couldn't have been good.
Agents, I appreciate you coming down here,
but I have nothing to say to you about the injunction.
A newspaper editor telling the FBI "no comment."
That's ironic.
I think we're done here.
No, sir, we're not. This is a pointless exercise.
Tomorrow we'll be back with a warrant
and we'll get the answers we came for.
Unless that's the point.
Waste our time and buy some more of your own.
Time? To do what?
Get ahead of the story. One of your own is dead.
That reflects badly on you.
Albert Stillman deserves some privacy.
He was my friend.
Then cooperate.
Because if a friend of mine died the way yours did,
I wouldn't rest until I got to the bottom of it.
His behavior seemed like a psychosis
from binge methamphetamine or cocaine use.
Go the other direction.
Benzos.
Downers.
For his back.
And when he couldn't get any more,
I tried to get it for him,
but by then he wasn't interested.
'Cause he'd moved on to something cheaper, like street heroin.
That's why I filed the injunction.
I didn't want you or the police
to look at a toxicology report and write him off as another junkie.
I think there's more to it than that.
Yeah, so do we.
What do you know about the source he was going to meet?
Not much. All he told me,
he was writing a piece on, uh, vaccinations.
I'd like to see his notes.
He kept it all up here.
Said it was the one hard drive
nobody could hack or subpoena.
So whatever that last story was,
it died with him.
How we doing, beautiful?
My perfectly coiffed eyebrows furrowed in concern.
Do you know that throwaway cell
phone that called Albert Stillman?
It made another call this morning
to a Dr. William Suri.
He is a research scientist in entomology, of all things.
Baby girl, hold on a second.
This guy work at Barnett College?
I know you guys are psychic, but how did you do that?
They've been dealing with some college incident all morning.
I'll call you back.
Officer. The incident at the college-- what do we know?
All we got is there was a fight in the research lab,
but nobody saw anything. It's locked up now.
Detectives are heading over.
All right, we need that address.
No forced entry.
Dr. Suri let his attacker in.
This wasn't an assault, it was an abduction.
What do we know about this guy?
Well, according to his assistant,
he was published but controversial.
Controversial. We're talking about bugs, right?
He had extreme theories
on the impact humans have on insect mating habits.
This is probably the doctor's cell phone.
Whoever did this made sure to leave it behind.
Didn't want us tracing him through GPS
because of the unsub's organization.
It also means this isn't an equivocal death investigation anymore.
This is serial.
Spence. The M.E. has something we need to see right away.
You.
What are you doing to me?
What do you want?
You said you wanted proof.
So you attack me?
You bring me to this place?!
Where are we?
Do you see it?
Please tell me that is not my blood.
No. No, it's mine.
Don't you see anything strange about it?
I--I need to look at it under a slide, run some tests--
What are you talking about?
It's right there in front of you. It's black!
No, it's not. What are you talking about?
Ah! you've corrupted the sample.
How could I have corrupted the sample?!
Look at me! Look what you're doing to me!
I'm tied to a chair!
Now, I--I have listened to you.
I have entertained all of your theories.
But what you have described to me...
It is not possible.
It might be real to you,
but that is...
that is because you are sick.
Yeah.
You're right.
Let me show you what it feels like to be sick like I am!
No!
Duct tape residue was found on his wrist, ankles, and neck.
So he was held against his will?
Yeah.
It's the rest of it I can't explain.
The victim's own skin was found under his fingernails.
The fingernails were in turn gouged into different parts of his body.
He broke them off scratching himself?
Yeah. And kept scratching all the
way down to his subcutaneous layer on his index and middle fingers.
Are these track marks consistent with heroin abuse?
Oh, yeah. Tox screen came back positive, too.
When was the last time he shot up?
Based on scar tissue, I'd say about a week ago.
Ok, so he was kicking when the unsub held him.
One of the withdrawal symptoms of that
is it feels like your skin is on fire.
You can't help but scratch.
Think about this for a second.
Stillman was bound, but the unsub cut him loose.
He wanted him to scratch.
That tells us this isn't torture.
If it were torture, he would have never taken the duct tape off.
What if it's an expression of his own pain?
Maybe the unsub wants his victims to feel
what's going on inside of him.
Which is?
Welts on the skin behind his ear.
Some sort of external irritant the unsub introduced.
Saw that, too.
Lab's running tests.
I don't know, a bite, maybe?
Wait--wait--
Wait! Wait.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, please?!
No, no, no!
No, no, please don't-- please don't do this!
No, you're right! I hear you, I hear you.
Please. Please. Don't do this!
I beg you, please don't do this!
Please think about this. You're right! Please stop it!
Don't, don't, please! Don't do this to me.
We can talk about this.
I want to talk about this. Please, please, don't do it!
No! oh, no! No, stop it!
Oh, no, please!
No more, please! Please stop it!
No, no! You're right! No, stop it!
Oh, my God! No!
No! Please stop it! Please stop it!
Oh, stop it! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Oh, please! Stop it!
So, we found William Suri.
Yeah. Garbage truck almost ran over him this morning.
Our unsub didn't hold him as long.
Then he shot him pointblank in the head.
Big change in M.O.
Not necessarily. He shows less signs of scratching,
but the bite marks are definitely there.
So, the unsub wants this guy to itch,
the good doctor doesn't play along,
bang, he ends the torture early.
I don't think this is torture for the unsub.
I think it's a delusion.
Can I have those tweezers?
What kind of delusion?
Bugs.
We need to deliver the profile.
We believe the unsub we're looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis,
a condition in which the patient believes
that he's being attacked or infested by bugs.
He takes his victims and covers them in insects,
cockroaches specifically.
We think it's to convince his victims
that they share in his condition.
Is he trying to get them sick so he can kill them?
Murder isn't his goal, attention is.
Believe it or not, this unsub is crying out for help.
He kidnapped an investigative journalist
because he wanted Albert Stillman
to write a story about the bugs inside of him.
Unfortunately, because Stillman was suddenly experiencing
opiate withdrawal,
he was already hallucinating insects,
and this led to a psychotic break.
So the unsub changed tactics.
He kidnapped a controversial research scientist
who he thought would be more willing to believe him.
But we think Dr. Suri recognized his condition
for the mental illness that it is.
That's why he killed him so quickly.
It is important that we not label this unsub
as crazy or insane to the media or press.
He's desperate to confirm his own self-diagnosis
and he'll be violent towards those who don't.
And this kind of delusion goes hand in hand with conspiracy thinking.
He probably believes the bugs are part of a plot
involving the government to keep him sick.
When he's alone, he'll be paranoid and disorganized.
His body will be mutilated from self-harm.
But his search for a fellow believer
will give him focus and allow him to appear calm and rational.
We should be canvassing the entomology and infectious disease fields
as well as reviewing hospital intake records.
This unsub has searched high and low for treatment for his condition,
and we believe that he'll return to one of these locations
for his next victim. Thank you.
I think that we have time for one more share.
Anybody?
Go ahead, Jane.
So, I went back to the dermatologist,
and she again tried to tell me what my problem was.
You know, she said that it was maybe mold
or static electricity.
I mean, can you think about that,
that's what's going on inside my body could be--
because of static electricity? Just...
And then she had the nerve to try and sell me a salve.
And when I looked to see what was inside the salve,
it was St. John's wort.
I mean, really, do you think I haven't' already tried st. John's wort?
And I just...
And I could see it
really clearly now, you know?
It's not me.
It's society.
You know? They want me to be sick.
Because if I'm sick, if it's me,
they can keep ignoring me.
But I won't be ignored anymore.
Thank you for letting me share.
Ok, why don't we stand up and join hands
and end our meeting with our prayer.
Lord, grant me the wisdom to see the light...
Hi. I'm Leo.
The strength to believe the truth...
Serenity with my body...
The courage to know how to...
There's an inherent contradiction in who this unsub is.
Only one?
All right, humor me.
This guy has a phobia of insects, right?
So why subject his victims to the very thing he hates?
It's not a phobia.
Well, maybe not, but the bugs disgust him.
Labels are important here.
The original name for this was entomophobia,
which is, yes, the fear/ disgust at being bitten, being stung,
or the fear of future infestation,
but if you have delusional parasitosis,
you believe you're already infested.
Present tense, not future tense.
So his worst fear has come true.
What he wants now is exposure.
He believes if society and the
scientific community take him seriously,
maybe he'll get relief.
Yeah, but that's impossible if it's all in his head.
The more people that tell him that,
the more angry he's gonna get.
Which is why he'll take solace in people
who are as frustrated as he is.
Guys, there's a suspect pool we've been missing all along.
I'm here for helping.
Garcia, I'm going to run through a series
of debated and controversial diseases.
I want you to tell me if there are
any support groups in the area.
Hit me.
Fibromyalgia.
No.
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
No.
Recurrent Lyme Disease.
Negative.
Morgellons?
There's a Magellan's Astronomy Club that meets on Tuesdays.
No, Morgellons.
M-o-r-g-e-l-l-o-n-s.
Huh. Those vowels will get ya.
Checking now.
I'll bite. What's Morgellons?
It's a syndrome where sufferers believe they have
disease-causing fibers under their skin.
They collect them only to
later be told by dermatologists
that all they've found is lint, dead skin,
or their own picked scabs.
Sounds like it's on the OCD spectrum.
There's a lot of overlap. There's also patients
who insist the fibers are insect like in nature.
Yeah, update. There's a Morgellons group
that gets together tonight, actually. Just missed then.
Garcia, we need an address.
Done.
JJ, you and Morgan go and see if they'll talk to us.
No, no, no, no.
The drinking water.
Drinking wa...
You think they put it in the drinking water?
Yeah, that's the easiest way to infect us.
That means everyone's sick.
Everyone is sick.
See, but you and I, we react to it differently. Right?
We feel it differently.
That's what makes us special.
So...
if it's this thing that I have...
We have.
that we have...
is real--
Oh, it's very real.
How do I get people to believe us?
I was getting really close,
and that's when they tried to kill me.
They tried to kill you?
When you worked at...
Well, how do you live with that?
They could just come and get you anytime.
Actually, I'm grateful.
'cause whatever they did to me,
it turned up the volume, ok?
It improved my intuition, my instincts.
When something's wrong, it comes out more.
While we've been sitting here, it hasn't come out once.
That tells me something.
I haven't felt it either.
See?
Maybe that's the cure.
You and me.
Maybe.
How bad does it get for you?
Pretty bad.
Do you want to see?
Yeah, but...not here.
Let's get out of here.
Why am I not surprised that the FBI
is showing up at my meetings?
Look, we're just asking if you can think of anyone
who might fit our profile.
Oh, I'll tell you what I think.
I think this is the same tactic
that the FBI pulls over and over again.
Occupy, WTO, anti-war groups,
only this time, you people are really
scraping the bottom of the barrel.
I'll bet that you even worked out
a little shakedown speech on the way over.
Hey, weirdoes, we support your right for free assembly,
but there might be a serial killer among you,
so watch your back.
Right? You want us scared.
You want us isolated.
That way it's easier for you to
tell us Morgellons is made up.
Ms. Randall, we have no opinion about your condition
one way or the other.
Do you see this man?
His name is Albert Stillman.
And this man.
Dr. William Suri.
Do you see him?
This is not made up. This is real.
The man we're looking for
thinks he has cockroaches inside of him.
He'd be quiet. Not demonstrative.
Probably not comfortable sharing to the entire group,
but very convincing one on one.
Ms. Randall, do you know anyone like that?
No.
No one.
What makes you think that he would even show up here?
'cause your group would listen to what he has to say,
and you'd believe him.
But that doesn't mean we're like him.
No, it doesn't.
But it could mean you're his next target.
You sure?
Yeah.
You ready?
1...
Sorry.
I didn't want you to tense up.
No, it's ok.
It's worse when you tense up.
Oh, it's perfect.
Uh, can you hand me a slide?
All right.
All right, look.
They should be wiggling.
Can you see them?
Please see them.
I see them.
Thank you.
Are they only in your blood?
No.
They're everywhere.
Tell me again that it's real.
It's real.
Can you heal me?
Yeah. I can.
Where are we on the E.R. intake?
Garcia weeded out the mental health transfers.
No one fits.
Our best bet is still the Morgellons Group.
When's their next meeting?
Next week.
It's too long to wait.
We could take another shot at the leader.
There's definitely something that she was holding back.
You had thought she wouldn't rattle.
She won't. We're gonna have to find some other way in.
Top of the morning, fellow leprechauns.
Where did Lisa Randall go after she met with JJ and Morgan?
According to her credit card...
drugstores.
5 of them, to be precise.
And she bought a single item 5 times.
Diaper rash cream.
All right, thanks.
JJ, see if she'll come in and talk.
Reid, I need you to go to the drugstore.
You sleep?
I never really sleep.
Hi, Jane, honey, come on. Quick like a bunny.
Oh, it's Lisa.
What the hell is she doing here?
Well, she takes me to the meetings sometimes.
Hey, open this door!
Open this door right now!
Hi, honey, it's me. Are you in there?
Jane, open this door!
Get rid of her.
Calm down. She's one of us, right?
Are you in there?
Don't.
I want to see who it is.
Hello?
It's probably--
No.
Be quiet.
Yes, Agent Jareau.
Yes. Yes, I'll come down to the station.
She--she's talking to the police?
Why would she talk to the police like that?
No, no, she called somebody an agent.
That--that's not the police, it's the Fed.
What do they want with us?
I'll take care of it. Just hold on.
Ms. Randall, I'm Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.
I have already told the other agents everything that I have to say.
Do you know why you itch?
Well, my neurologist tried
to explain it as simply as he could to me
so I would stop coming to his office.
My amygdala, which is the emotional center of my brain,
has hijacked my prefrontal cortex,
which is the rational side.
So in times of stress, I itch.
But, look at me now.
I'm in the FBI office being questioned.
One would think that would be a very stressful thing
for anyone and I'm not itching.
How old was she when she died?
Excuse me?
Did she make it to her third birthday?
I don't know who you talked to,
but you have no right.
I haven't talked to anyone.
I'm trained to see what's in front of me.
I notice that you don't
wear a wedding ring under your gloves.
I think a condition like yours makes it difficult
to build intimate relationships.
I know you looked everywhere for some sort of relief.
Doctors' prescriptions, antihistamines. None of it worked.
Nothing until you found this.
This works, doesn't it?
Yes.
Someone who's not a mother
doesn't stumble on a cure like that by accident.
What was her name?
Olivia.
She was a preemie.
So she was in and out of hospitals a lot.
Her skin at the end...
I guess it was from the tests and everything.
I was a new parent.
Do you know that feeling of, am I doing it right?
Am I helping?
You know? You just don't know.
I'm also trained to listen to what people say,
and that question, am I helping?
You ask yourself that every day, don't you?
I know you help the people who come to your meetings.
I know you want to help us.
I do?
Yes, you do. Because there's a man
who comes to your meetings who puts you on edge,
and your instincts of self-preservation
are telling you not to trust him,
and those instincts are always right.
Who is he?
His name is Leo.
I don't have his number or anything,
but I did see him talking to
one of my friends last night - Jane.
I knocked on her door this morning.
She didn't answer, but there was someone inside
because I heard them whispering.
I need Jane's information immediately.
Jane Posner, this is the FBI. Open up!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Open the door, Jane.
No. No. He was right.
We're not looking for you. We're looking for Leo.
He's not here.
He's gone.
Clear.
And you're never gonna find him.
Thank you so much.
Have you ever heard of a folie a deux, Jane?
It's where two people suffer from the same delusional belief.
We're not delusional.
He gets me.
All right.
Then tell us where he is
so we can understand what the two of you have.
You'll kill him.
We're not killers.
We're his best hope for getting better.
All we want to do is get him the help he needs.
Why should I believe you?
You already tried to kill him once.
When was that?
Don't play dumb. With the vaccinations.
What vaccinations?
I don't have to talk to you. So...
No, all you got to do is listen.
'Cause the closer we get to the truth,
the more you're going to be compelled to itch.
The first victim who met Leo
was going to write a story about vaccinations.
Is that how this all started,
because Leo got vaccinations?
That's a yes.
Find out who gave him the vaccinations,
we find Leo.
Was it his doctor?
Nope, wasn't his doctor.
Must have been work, then.
Was it the military? Did Leo serve?
It's not military.
Did he work in medicine?
Is it the hospital? Is that where he worked?
Or was it something more like infectious diseases?
'Cause you'd have to get vaccinated for that.
Like the Center for Disease Control,
right here in Atlanta.
Leave him alone.
Let's go.
What did you tell them?
I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't. I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Leo Jenkins. Haven't thought of him in a while.
Our search told us he worked here 6 months ago,
but his address isn't current.
Yeah, he asked me to send
his last check to a different address.
He was pretty paranoid by the end.
Because of the vaccinations?
Which he didn't even need.
I mean, he was a low-level lab assistant,
for god's sake. We were trying to help him.
Why would you give him shots he didn't need?
Leo had a painful case of shingles in his left arm.
One of the docs around here
gave him the antiviral acyclovir,
which, uh, deadened the nerves in his arm...
altogether. Here's his address.
How did that lead to cockroaches?
Your brain and nervous system
work on a best-guess feedback loop.
The nerves might be dead,
but your brain hasn't figured that out yet.
It's still sending stimuli to the dead nerves
in an attempt to get them to react.
Like an amputee who has feeling in his phantom limb.
Exactly. Leo started scratching and he couldn't stop.
Well, we told him the
feelings will come back when the drugs wore off,
But, uh, he insisted that
we'd put cockroach larvae in his vaccine.
That it was a conspiracy, that we were all trying to kill him.
We tried almost everything to talk him out of it.
Well, almost everything.
What didn't you try?
Leo, the FBI is looking for you.
Yeah, I know they are.
What I don't know is who you are.
I had to rethink everything I know about you.
At the meetings, when you shared
about pulling the fibers from your body
and you said they felt like spider legs...
You talked about how that made you feel crazy
'cause you're afraid of spider legs?
But is that true?
Are you afraid of spiders, Lisa?
Yes.
You are?
Yes.
No...you don't have to do this.
No, I do have to. I do have to,
Because, see, I don't know what the truth is anymore.
No.
See, you and I are gonna have a little chat.
Come on, Leo.
I'll just tell you anything that you want to know.
Just tell me what you want to know.
It's simple. Who do you work for?
I don't--I don't work for anybody.
Who do you work for? Who do you work for?
I don't work for anybody!
I just don't work for anybody.
I'll tell you I just don't work for...
You don't work for anybody? You're unemployed?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Who do you work for? Ok?
We'll keep going. We'll keep going until you give me...
Who do you work for?
I don't work for anybody!
No!
It's very simple!
I don't work for anybody!
Who do you work for?!
FBI! Don't move!
Oh, God.
Of course.
She works for you, doesn't she?
We're not here for her. We're here to talk to you.
How about you let her go and we'll do that.
You want to talk? Then how come these things
in my arms are going crazy, huh?
I know how this goes, ok?
I know how this goes. You shoot me
And then you cover up the whole thing. That's how it goes.
Is it happening now?
Of course it's happening now.
Don't tell me you don't see it.
Come on, you see it.
You see it!
I can make it go away.
Now, is that your phone?
Yeah, that's my phone.
Don't -- what are you doing?
Now, look at the camera.
What? I've shot video footage of myself a million times.
You guys do something to it and the image is gone.
It's gone. You guys do something to it.
I'm not shooting video.
This is a reflection.
Now look at it. Go ahead, look.
Look at your arm.
Is it going away?
That's a trick.
It's no trick.
How did you do that?
We can make them go away forever.
But you have to let her go, Leo.
What? Leo?
How the hell do you know my name?!
Don't move, don't even flinch.
Get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off!
See 'em, see 'em, see 'em, see 'em? Right there.
Right there.
I got 'em. I got 'em. Ok.
I got 'em.
So that's it?
You ruin my life, now I'm free to go?
You're not an accessory.
You didn't know what Leo was doing. So,
yeah, you're free to go.
You killed him, didn't you?
I told you, we're not killers.
I don't believe you.
You used me.
You tricked me so you could get him.
Jane, hey.
Jane.
Would you just listen to me for a second, ok?
Get away from me.
Ok, yeah, I had a job to do
and I'm not going to apologize for that.
But that doesn't mean that this is over.
Leo, he still needs you.
How?
He has a good chance of pleading insanity,
and he is going to need someone on his side
to explain his condition to the court.
Oh, yeah. 'cause if he's insane,
you could put him away forever.
Of course you didn't kill him,
'cause that would make a martyr out of him.
But if he's crazy, no one will ever know what I know.
Nobody. Which is that he's right!
Ok? About the government
and the drinking water
and you. All of it!
He was going to kill Lisa.
He -- he wouldn't do that.
I was there.
He had a gun to her head.
Lies.
Lies, lies, and more lies.
And you FBI jackbooted thugs
will do anything to protect yourselves
from him exposing you
as the filthy liars that you are.
Rossi, that was a pretty gutsy move.
How'd you know it was gonna work?
The doc at the CDC told us about
something they wanted to try
but never got around to.
It's called a mirror box.
Oh, I read about that treatment.
What's this treatment?
It's for amputees with searing pain in their phantom limbs.
Basically, you take a patient,
you put them in front of a mirror
and you tell them to conduct a symphony,
to wave, or just to relax.
When their brain sees what's not there,
the pain goes away.
And since the unsub had dead nerves in his arm
due to the shingles antiviral...
You could argue that his itch
was the same thing as phantom limb pain,
I mean from a brain-nervous system feedback loop.
My hope was that the trick would make the itch go away,
and it did, for a few seconds, anyway.
I can understand being driven crazy
by something you can't scratch,
but killing people over it, that's what surprises me.
There is one documented case about a woman
who couldn't stop scratching, even when she was asleep.
She woke up one morning realizing she'd scratched
through her own scalp, her skull,
and directly into her brain tissue.
Ok, on that note,
my ride's here.
How did it go with Jane?
She blames us for everything.
Now she's gonna go back to the group
and we'll be their new excuse for why they can't get better.
How do we help somebody like that?
Well, one of them's feeling better already.
