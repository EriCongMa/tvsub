let &apos;s start with the handshake .
hi
very good handshake . good wrist action .
let me try.okay
oh , my god ! what did i ever do to you ?
did i squeeze too hard ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m glad i &apos;m not chandler .
the one with rachel &apos;s lnadvertent kiss
that &apos;s right , ross . i can see you in your new apartment .
you can see me
same as yesterday , same as the day before .
is he doing his &quot; shark attack &quot; bit ?
no . oh , wait ! there he goes .
very funny , ross .
very lifelike and funny .
no , no . i wasn &apos;t waving at you , lady .
whoa , maybe i was .
this hot girl in ross &apos; building is flirting with me .
get in there , man . flirt back . mix it up !
yeah , i &apos;m down with that .
okay , here goes .
how ...
... you ...
... doing ?
it worked ! she &apos;s waving me over .

no , no ! i &apos;m not with her.that &apos;s just monica .
hey , joey ! great stuff , huh ?
this your place ? yeah , of course it is .

go by the window . you can pretend to be surfing .
i counted . you &apos;re not supposed to live here !
oh , man !
what happened ?
i ended up at ross &apos; place . i must have miscounted or something .
damn ! she &apos;s not there anymore .
look , ross is doing his &quot; watching tv &quot; bit .
no , joe , i think he &apos;s just watching tv .
we &apos;ve lost visual contact with the suspect .
okay , now i really have to go .
it &apos;s so unfair
that our date has to get cut short ... just because some guy shot at a store clerk .
i know , but it &apos;s my job .
then maybe i could come too
suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer .
all right , you go .
bye bye ! okay ! bye
oh , god !
what ?
oh , i just miss him so much !
for just a week , you guys are close .
yeah , it &apos;s weird .
i can &apos;t help it . he &apos;s so sweet .
he &apos;s like this little puppy dog , you know ? but like a really tough one who shoots bad guys .
i love the beginning parts of relationships .
you can &apos;t keep your hands off each other .
i know . it is the best .
how long did that last for you and chandler ?
what ? it &apos;s still going on .
come on , seriously . when did it end ?
i am serious . we &apos;re all over each other all the time .
okay , you know where you are better than i do .
why don &apos;t you just calm down ?
get all your facts
before you tell everybody you &apos;re the only hot couple .
god , i woke the beast .
i was wrong , obviously . i just misspoke .
it &apos;s okay . it is okay .
as long as you know chandler and l are also hot and fiery.just as hot as you .
i mean , our flame .... it is on fire !
here &apos;s your broom back .
you are so cute !
the cute bar keeps getting lower and lower , doesn &apos;t it ?
how &apos;d the interview go ?
horrible ! i did the stupidest , most embarrassing thing .
did you say you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair ?
no
did you get drunk on the way over there ?
no
well , that explains why you didn &apos;t do the other stuff .
so , what happened ?
it was horrible ! and the interview part went so well .
i even made him laugh .
he said something about a boat ...
... and i was like , &quot; well , yeah , if you &apos;ve got enough life jackets . &quot;
trust me . it was actually very funny .
anyway , we were saying goodbye and ....
what happened ?
we were shaking hands ... and he leaned in toward me .
maybe he was opening the door ... but i totally misread him
and i ....
you kissed him ?
i didn &apos;t know what else to do !
you could have tried ...
... not kissing him.thanks , chandler .
a guy from ralph lauren called . you got a second interview .
monica , that &apos;s not funny .
oh , okay .
a guy from ralph lauren called you got a second interview
oh , my god , monica , you better be serious .
you just told me to be funny !
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe it ! i got a second interview .
that kiss isn &apos;t looking like such a mistake now , is it ?
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s why he wants me back ?
yeah !
no ?
what are you talking about ?
i accidentally kissed him in the interview ... and now he wants me back
... because , &quot; let &apos;s bring back the girl who kisses everybody ! &quot;
come on , rach .
what if he thinks i &apos;ll just sleep with him ?
he wants you back because you &apos;re right for the job .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
oh , god ! how could i be so stupid ?
rachel , don &apos;t say that . i think you just need a hug from joey .
come on . come on .
she &apos;s back ! hot girl &apos;s back !
well , i &apos;m not totally back yet , but i appreciate it .
no . in ross &apos; building . she &apos;s back !
wait there . i &apos;ll be over in a second .
one , two , three .... got it !
i gotta check out this hot girl .
there she is !
damn it ! did you move ?
yes.i lived with you for a while . then i found this place .
i &apos;m ross .
yes ?
do you happen to have a hot girl in there ?
no , i &apos;m all alone .
yeah . sorry about that .
hey , little girl .
is your mommy or sister or babysitter , by any chance , a hot girl ?
daddy !
later , girl !
oh , man !
hot girl ?
hot girl !
hi , rachel . come on in .
it &apos;s nice to see you again .
thank you .
rachel ...
what ?
excuse me ?
yeah , let me
okay , i see what &apos;s going on here .
now , look ... i &apos;m sorry if i gave you the wrong impression .
but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead .
even though i kissed you , that does not give you ...
... the right to demand sex from me !
i do not want this job that bad .
good day , sir .
if you &apos;re going in there to see mr. zelner , i hope you &apos;re ready to put out .
i am .
you are not gonna believe ... what that sleazeball from ralph lauren did to me !
okay , that &apos;s amazing ! how did you know that ?
you got ink on your lip .
what do you say , maybe , sometime i hold your gun ?
we &apos;re not supposed to do that .
what could happen ? i mean
yeah . i &apos;m gonna say no .
do you want to see a movie tonight ?
we can &apos;t . we already have plans .
what are you doing ?
well , same thing we did all day . just hang out at gary &apos;s apartment .
he is so amazing . we never left the bedroom .
but have fun at the movie .
well , we &apos;re not seeing a movie .
then why did you ask us if we wanted to go ?
because i just wanted to know what you were doing ... so you wouldn &apos;t walk in on me and chandler while we were doing it all night .
will you excuse me ?
chandler ? can i see you for a second ?
we have got to beat them !
why ?
because gary and phoebe think they &apos;re a hotter couple than us .
so ?
so we &apos;ve gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong !
you &apos;ve got to stop this competitive thing . it &apos;s crazy .
just to impress them , you want us to have sex over and over ...
... and i &apos;m saying no to this , why ? get your coat !
excuse me .
you should check this out . tell the other tenants .
apparently , he &apos;s looking for some kind of hot girl .
who isn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met . i &apos;m ross .
i know . you &apos;re the guy who wouldn &apos;t chip in for the handyman .
never mind .
i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.i mean , you had just moved in
i had just moved in ! thank you !
listen .... jen
jen.i know this may sound a little
but would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime ?
sure , that would be nice .
my number &apos;s on there . give me a call .
i will give you a call .
i &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
i forgot my paper .
that was amazing .
phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner .
that was amazing .
we are the hottest , huh ?
no one is hotter than we are .
we &apos;re the best .
no , you &apos;re the best .
no , you &apos;re the best.-no , you &apos;re the best
i am the best .
hey , guys .
what you been doing ?
isn &apos;t that the girl who waved at you ?
i don &apos;t know , but i can see through your sheet .
yeah , that &apos;s her .
you know , it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll never meet her .
why ? it &apos;s impossible to find her apartment !
she lives in some hot @-@ girl parallel universe or something .
what are you talking about ?
she lives on the 2nd floor , 7th apartment from the left .
no ,
she lives on the 3rd floor , 8th apartment from the left .
no . those first two windows , that &apos;s the lobby .
that other window is the stairway . you &apos;ve been counting wrong .
i did not know that ! thank you , monica .
i almost lost another girl because of counting !
so you ready ?
yeah , i &apos;ll just get my coat.-okay
could you get that ?
sure .
joey
no ! no !
first , i would like to say thank you for seeing me again .
that &apos;s quite right.but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped .
well , first , i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you ...
... and for yelling at you .
fair enough .
now , you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ...
yell at you and storm out .
and i think that &apos;s a big mistake . and here &apos;s why .
i made a huge fool of myself , and i came back . that shows courage .
when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job , i said no .
that shows integrity .
and i was not afraid to stand up for myself ... and that shows courage .
now , i know that i &apos;ve already said courage ...
... but you &apos;ve got to have courage .
and finally , when i thought you were making sexual advances ...
... i said no , and i was not litigious .
so there you go ! you got courage ... you got integrity
... you got courage again ... and not litigious .
look , mr ....
zelner.-ya , zelner , oh , i knew that .
i really , really want this job .
and i think i would be really good at it .
you know what ?
i may regret this ...
... but i &apos;ll give you a shot .
you are ? really ?
thank you . oh , god !
would it be inappropriate if i gave you a hug ?
yes
all right
well , how about a handshake ?
oh , god ! i &apos;m sorry !
i did not mean to touch that !
i mean , you ! there !
i &apos;m gonna leave .
thank you very much .
hey , i &apos;ll see you monday .
are you tired ?
you better believe he &apos;s tired after the day we had !
if you know what i mean .
do you know what i mean ?
honey , the tortilla chips know what you mean .
do you like that badge i got you ?
oh , yeah , it &apos;s so cool .
now , i gotta go . officer bing &apos;s got a 10 @-@ 100 .
that &apos;s pee @-@ pee .
phoebe , you have a twig in your hair .
we kind of took a detour on our way over here .
we were strolling through the park and no one was around , so ....
you didn &apos;t .
we did !
we violated section 12 , paragraph 7 of the criminal code .
the park , huh ?
public place .
i hear you .
can you excuse me for a second ?
hi , chandler .
monica , this is the men &apos;s room .
isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
i &apos;ve always found the men &apos;s bathroom very sexual .
haven &apos;t you ?
no .
and if i did , i don &apos;t think we &apos;d be going out .
okay , i don &apos;t want to disappoint you ...
... and i really don &apos;t want to disappoint the guy in the second stall ....
sorry , man .
but come on , this is getting ridiculous .
come on , we can &apos;t let them win !
we &apos;ve proved that we are hot , okay ? so why are you obsessed about this ?
phoebe and gary are in that ... &quot; can &apos;t keep their hands off each other &quot; phase !
so ?
it makes me really sad that we &apos;re not really there anymore .
oh , is that what this has all been about ?
wasn &apos;t it a lot more exciting when we were ... all over each other all the time ?
yeah , that was great . that was really great .
but the truth is , i &apos;m more excited about where we are now .
really ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve never been in a relationship this long before .
to get past the beginning and still want to be around each other ...
... i think that &apos;s incredible .
and the fact that this is happening with you ...
... i think that &apos;s pretty exciting .
that &apos;s so sweet .
i know that i was acting a little crazy ... but i feel the same way .
really ?
you know what i just realized ?
you just freaked out about our relationship.-i did not .
yes , you did ! admit it . you freaked out !
i freaked out a little .
a little ? you freaked out bigtime , okay ?
and i fixed it ! we have switched places .
i am the relationship king , and you are the crazy , irrational screwup !
and now we &apos;re back .
i cannot believe ross is buying this .
thank god ! i can &apos;t watch him anymore .
you guys ready ? -yes
by the way , thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine .
