The commonwealth calls Lesli Stone.
Even though Alison was already locked up
her friends were all on edge
about anyone asking any questions.
Do you remember everything that Charles made you do?
Yeah, don't you?
No, not really.
亲爱的儿子
He never left Radley. He killed himself when he was 16.
Your brother might still be alive.
We go to Radley.
I can't believe you went home.
I thought maybe once my mom got over
the shock of me being back, things would be different.
Were they?
No.
This is Dean Stavros.
Spencer, I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
Help! Help!
I just needed to get some air and the door wouldn't open.
I'm Clark.
Maybe you could sell me something
that would help calm my nerves.
Yeah, what?
Pot.
Sabrina made me some cookies.
Whatever is bothering you, is still going to be there.
I can't sleep. My mind won't shut off.
I just want to quiet the noise.
Hello?
Hello?
Wait, wait!
Who are you?
Hold it. Go back.
Did you see his face in the dream?
The word is nightmare.
And no, I didn't, that's when I fell off the bed.
So who was the little girl?
I don't know.
I've never seen her before.
Or maybe I have.
Well, again, Spencer, it was just a dream.
Or nightmare.
Well, what about that creepy room?
I mean, do you remember ever seeing it--
I don't know, and if I did
I've completely burned it from my brain.
Listen, I should go.
Wait, wait.
When we went back inside after A locked us out
do you remember a tiled room?
It was right next to the--
Spencer, I do not wanna--
Aria, please, just help me.
I can't. Seriously.
It-it is taking all that I have to forget that place.
It is bad enough I can't even walk by the photo lab--
What did you do with that hair dye?
Huh, you're giving me cramps.
Aria, we can't just throw away clues.
What're you eating?
Hello? Spencer, are you there?
Yeah. I'm still here.
My mother's just sitting on my chest.
She's still on my case about this stupid valedictorian thing.
Well, why don't you just say yes?
Because it's a pity toss, that's why.
I've been gone for over a month.
She probably offered to buy them a planetarium.
Just do it.
Please,
just give me a freaking reason to go to graduation.
Oh, really? Now you wanna go to graduation?
I thought your dad excused you
from ever having to step foot in school again.
Oh, God. I have to run.
What just happened?
My mom just back from Curves
and I'm not having this argument with her
after she pumped iron.
I'll call you later, okay? Bye.
God! Mona.
Is this a bad time?
When did you get back?
Late last night.
I just saw your mom as she was leaving for work.
She introduced me to that cop parked at your curb.
What's with the shades?
Is that cop really here 24/7?
Yup.
And there's a bunch at school too.
They stand outside the bathroom while you pee.
I wish we'd never come back here.
Well, did you feel any safer at the spa?
Safer than I feel being in the same zip code as Alison.
Mona!
I sent her to jail, Hanna. For months.
There's no way she's not plotting some kind of revenge.
That's what you're worried about?
A is still out there.
You've got bigger worries than Alison.
Yeah, I know, and when I leave here
I have to go straight to the police station.
They might still press charges against me
for being dead when I wasn't.
Well, that's not a crime, that's just being stupid.
No, Han, when there's a full-on investigation
that costs the taxpayers more than our new sewer system,
it's a crime.
And I don't think I'll have any cops looking out for me.
They're looking for A! We all are.
Even more reason for Alison to wanna hurt me.
Forget Alison.
We have to track down anyone
who ever had any contact with Charles DiLaurentis.
Someone who worked at Radley has got to know something!
I'm betting their father.
He's no help.
Alison is so embarrassed.
She only leaves her house nowadays to go to church.
Church? Alison?
Don't get all judge-y.
She's just trying to move on. We all are.
Well, will you at least drop me off
at the precinct before school?
I can't go in there alone.
Please?
Yeah. No, my shift started at 10:00.
She hasn't left the house since yesterday..
'...unless she dug a tunnel.'
'Yeah, you know, with this little skank'
'I wouldn't be surprised, right?'
'Who's protecting us from her?'
'Yeah, seriously.'
'I mean, how many people has she put behind bars?'
'I think they should chain her to the bed.'
'Right.'
'Yeah.'
'So are you running second shift tomorrow?'
'I think so.'
Alright, well, see you then.
Mom, I-I can't talk to you when you're like this.
Yes, you are. You're slurring your words.
I'll call you later.
Hey, what do you say we go to the movies tonight?
If my mom comes with us.
Emily, I've gotta go home.
Why? I thought you said your mom--
I did. But now she wants me back.
Does she think that she can make some money
off of what happened to you?
Probably.
But I have to deal with her.
Or you could stop dealing with her all together.
Have you ever thought about getting legally emancipated?
How did you know--
I'm a psychic.
That or you told me you'd be working in your dad's office today.
Oh, right. What's up?
Well, I was looking over yesterday's photos
and I need to re-think what I'm shooting.
Why?
I mean my portfolio's starting to look like
one of those calendars the bank hands out for free.
I was thinking of taking a ride out to a junkyard on Route 47.
Wanna come?
Uh...no, no, I shouldn't.
I should stay here. I have a lotta work to do.
Well, don't go into an early retirement, girl.
I wasn't blowing smoke. Your stuff is good.
It's exactly the type of work they're looking for.
Who's looking for?
Didn't we talk about the contest?
Mm, no. What-what contest?
The Cardillo Fellowship, it's a cash prize
and a summer internship at a magazine.
Where?
In LA.
Yeah, I know it ain't Rosewood
but there are things worth photographing there too.
And you can do it in flip-flops.
Good luck with your work.
Um, Clark?
Can we just stop by my house, I need to grab my camera.
Yeah.
Why are you out here?
I just needed some air.
If you're going stir-crazy you can come with me to the office.
Do your homework in the conference room
no one will bother you.
I'm fine here.
I can always wear earplugs.
I overheard one of Rosewood's finest
dissing me to another cop.
Well, well..
Well, what?
I'd let it go.
Kinda hard when someone's kicked you in the teeth
before you've even brushed them.
Alison, you have to own it.
Bad behavior has a way of catching up with you.
You would know.
Do you want a latte?
I don't care, just order. Hurry.
I thought you weren't in a rush to go to the police.
'Mona?'
Lesli? Oh, my God.
What are you doing in Rosewood?
I was summoned by the police.
What? Why?
What do you mean, why? You made me an accomplice to a crime.
But you didn't do anything.
Yes, I did.
I made the mistake of complimenting a stranger
on her Dolce & Gabbana stretch pants.
'And now, everything that I have worked for'
my fellowship, my teaching position, my reputation
they're all in jeopardy
'because I actually saw you as the victim.'
You, you conniving little bitch!
Whoa, easy. This is her first day home.
Sorry, I forgot the champagne.
Get a grip, Lesli.
Mona never made up that plan to hurt you.
Really?
You think I actually wanted perjury on my resume?
I don't know what that means
but I really don't like your tone.
Who gives a crap what you like, you bag of hair.
Guys, stop.
Lesli, I'm sorry about all this, I swear.
I'll call you later--
Don't.
If you ever try to reach out to me
or you mention my name to anyone ever again
and you will live to regret it.
I believe in payback too.
I mean, she acts like being questioned by the police
is the same thing Mona's been through.
And then she turns it on me. Me.
I'm like, "Hello! I should be biting your head off, freak.
You're the one who testified against me." Am I wrong?
Okay, unless you're texting me the answer, you're rude.
Wha.. I'm sorry, um...Toby's not back 'til Monday.
That's a really long time to wait.
Wait for what?
Eww, why would you say that?
I didn't say anything, I just smiled.
Well, your cup may runneth over, but mine is bone dry.
Eww, why? Did you and Caleb have a fight?
No, we don't even fight anymore.
He treats me like some cracked egg
that fell out of a robin's nest.
Who's that?
Mona.
She's scared of Alison and Lesli Stone now.
Uh, just stay out of it.
Hell no, Lesli is a freaking lunatic
who needs a serious reality check.
Mona was locked in a hole by someone who is still out there.
Her friend should forgive her.
That's not staying out of it.
Spencer, we can't have Mona quaking in her boots
when we need that boot to kick the doors down at Radley.
I mean, I'm not going back to that shredding place
and Mona knows Radley more than any of us.
Does she have any idea who could be posing as Ali's dead brother?
Don't say dead.
Charles isn't dead dead until we find something to prove it.
What is wrong with you?
It's not your cookie.
Okay, first you're sexting Toby like some dog in heat
and then you're gumming at your dessert like my grandma.
How long do you want that cookie to last?
We're not talking about me, okay?
The subject is Charles, and it's not gonna be easy
breaking into Radley with or without Mona.
Are you buzzed?
What? No, Hanna, focus.
You have the same look in your eyes
as this girl in my government class
who hums and makes chokers out of paper clips.
I'm not humming, I'm just.. I'm missing Toby.
Well, Dr. Oz says sex is a drug too, Spencer.
Maybe you should figure that one out.
I like. Are, uh, dolls your thing?
No. Actually, I find them pretty creepy
but, um...it's this new thing I'm trying.
Embracing the creepy.
Oh, I get it.
I, um, did this project last year, where I took vegetables
and did a photo progression as they rotted.
That sounds pretty cool. How'd it turn out?
I had a smelly apartment and a major fruit-fly problem
but other than that it was okay.
What are you doing?
Sorry, uh, the shadow was across your face
and I just couldn't help myself.
In honor of us diving into things that scare us..
...would you be up to having dinner with me tonight?
Clark, uh..
that's a really nice offer, but I can't.
I'm just.. I'm not dating.
At least not for a while.
This past year has been really difficult
and without having...to go into all the details--
No, I know.
I-I recognized you. From the news.
I didn't wanna bring it up when we first met.
I figured it's probably hard enough for you.
I didn't wanna make you feel self-conscious.
I apologize.
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
Uh, there's bike rides and lake activities
I mean there's even an overnight.
You're not scared of being in the woods after sundown, are you?
No, I have been in the woods.
I just don't think I'm gonna be going back
without a police escort.
They're watching me all the time.
They're watching out for you, Alison.
You're not the person they're trying to catch.
Look, if you don't wanna do it--
It's not that I don't want to. I just..
Do you remember the church, Ali?
I recommended you for this. No one gave any pushback.
Seriously?
Well, there were a few people
who didn't say, "Yay," right away
but I took advantage of the silence.
I really believe you can make a difference with these kids.
Hey, dad. Uh, you remember Lorenzo?
Hey there.
Hello.
Is this your idea of a replacement?
Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop
you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?
That's not what I told you.
You claimed that cop insulted you.
He did.
Whoa, wait.
Who did?
Uh, you can leave now.
Thank you.
Why?
The last time I checked, this was still my house.
Goodbye, Lorenzo.
Okay, do you have anything that you might wanna put on a resume?
Any small job you had before, uh..
I mean, I babysat for my neighbors' kids.
That, uh, that may not be enough.
Caleb, she was 14 when she ran away from home.
She's looking to be emancipated.
No one expects her to have started a hedge fund.
No, but they do expect her to have a job
where she can support herself and a high school diploma.
We should go.
No, wait.
Caleb, you were able to do this.
Yeah, and that's how I know it's not an easy process.
Look, if you're only a couple of months away from turning 18
I would say just go home and wait it out--
No, she's not waiting it out.
She's lost enough time, every moment is precious.
What just happened?
Nothing. Nothing. It was my fault.
Okay.
I thought about blowing it off..
but there are only so many family dinners you can skip.
So I went.
And the questions started.
I told everyone I lost my job
and I was actively looking for another.
I came so close to raiding my sister's medicine chest.
Then I realized..
I'd already delivered the bad news.
Nobody blinked.
Putting it out there right away..
it helped.
Uh, I'm Dean and I'm an addict.
Hi, Dean.
I just got back from a family event myself.
My older brother's wedding.
I have a lot of the same issues that Sheldon has.
Some old grudges and some new ones.
I could feel everybody wondering if I was high.
Expecting me to be the same person
that showed up to anything without a buzz on.
Excuse me.
The refreshments are for after the meeting.
Sorry.
Okay, I may have gone a little overboard.
I've got over eight rolls in here.
Well, here, I'll help hang 'em up. Gimme a couple.
Thank you.
Aria. You wanna wait 'til they dry?
You're making me nervous.
No, they look great.
Where are you goin'?
I just have to make a quick phone call.
Aria?
Clark may have taken a picture of A.
Whoa, slow down. Who's Clark?
'The guy that I met in the Hollis photo lab.'
We-we went to a junkyard to take some pictures
and I'm pretty sure that A followed us there.
And Clark got A on camera?
By accident, but I-I can't examine the negatives
without looking like a freak, so maybe I should just tell him
what's going on and that way--
No! Don't.
Aria, if you say anything
Sarah's gonna be the one who gets targeted.
I'm the one that's being followed.
I left Rosewood for an hour and A was all over it.
Why don't you just print the photos out
and we'll look at them.
They're not mine, Em.
So, borrow them. Okay?
Clark's not gonna miss them for one night.
I gotta go.
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's all good.
Okay. Where were we?
I can't fake havin' a job.
What if they wanna call my boss?
Give them my number.
What are you gonna say?
That she works for me at my web design company.
You're willing to cover for her?
It's not a cover. It's minimum wage.
You start tomorrow.
Hey, Lesli, it's Hanna again.
I'm wondering if you... got my message
or if you just don't wanna meet, but..
Never mind.
Look, before we do this, can I just say one thing?
Sure.
I'm sorry.
I was way outta line this morning.
You are not the source of my anger.
Clearly, you got more screwed over by that Mona stunt
than I did, and if you found a way to forgive her--
I have.
And it would be great if you could too.
That... may not happen overnight.
Mona's complicated. Okay?
But she is not the real monster here.
That person hasn't been caught yet.
Maybe you're right..
but I still can't help but wonder if that..
Radley place helped Mona or made her worse.
Well, she's not the only one.
What does that mean?
That nut house may have closed down
but it still holds all the answers.
Answers to what?
I thought the police... ask the questions.
Taking matters into your own hands is exactly what got
your friend Mona into trouble in the first place.
Ready to hit the road?
Yup. Actually...
now I can't remember if I dumped out
the last of the solution.
Hang tight, I'll check.
Okay?
Alright.
We're all good.
Are you sure you don't wanna come in?
Mmm, pass.
The last time I saw that gate
your mother was tossing my duffle bag through it.
Aiming for my head.
Well, she's mellowed out a bit since then.
Oh, I doubt it.
Uh, if your family did mellow
I wouldn't be driving you home right now.
Look, I haven't been to a meeting in a while.
And it was just for some reassurance.
I thought it was the free food.
I'm just really tired of living
in a state of permanent anxiety.
If a few bites of a cookie can get me through my day
and help me sleep--
It doesn't work like that. You can't rationalize.
Uh, you're either in or you're out.
I know, I know.
But when you've been yanked out of one nightmare
and then shoved into another--
You're right. It sucks.
Yeah, but you're strong, Spencer..
stronger than you think.
Please... just don't say that.
Why? Why don't you believe that?
I gave something to you a long time ago and you never used it.
My number.
Maybe next time you can't sleep or..
Thank you.
Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Can you throw that out?
You're the first girl to toss her cookies in my car.
Thank you.
Mona? Is that you?
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing?
It's a card for Alison.
I know it's totally retro, but e-mails can be deleted
and she would never take my calls, so..
You look great, Spencer.
Much better than the last time I saw you.
I was on a hospital gurney.
Yeah, me too, but you looked more graceful being rolled.
Mona...can I ask you something?
You were in that dollhouse longer than any of us.
So do you think that it's possible
or could there be a chance
that there was another girl that was trapped down there?
Not Sara Harvey, but a-a younger girl
maybe 11 or 12.
Why are you asking me this?
I-I-I have this image in my head of a young girl.
She looks a lot like a young Alison and she's..
guiding me towards this creepy room
with these rusted bathtubs.
I think that everyone that was trapped
in that place escaped, Spencer.
Okay, but what about that room? Have you ever seen it?
It's got a couple of drains on the floor
and the walls are tiled, there's broken furniture everywhere
and God knows what horrible things happened down there.
No. I haven't seen it, but..
it sounds terrifying.
It is.
Maybe it doesn't exist.
I just.. I felt like I had been in there before.
I think it must live in your head.
Right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
So? How'd it go?
She said it would take a while for my PFE to go through, but..
that I could stay with you and your mom in the meantime.
That's amazing.
Okay, we have to do something special tonight.
How do you want to celebrate your freedom?
Let's make it permanent.
We're not leaving here
until we find something about Charles.
God, what did they keep down here?
Or should I say who?
Patient records.
Only the staff was allowed in the basement, not us.
I guarantee Mona's been down here.
Yeah, where is she?
I thought she was supposed to be our tour guide.
She wanted to come, but her mom's attached at the hip.
They, like, shower together.
God, why are all these doors locked?
Spence, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Wait, that door's open.
That's how I know this place.
What?
It was in Radley, not the dollhouse.
I've been here before.
I know this room.
Well, then, why am I the only one doing anything?
Can you help me? This is heavy.
Thanks.
Okay, once it dries
put this cream on it every day.
Every day.
That looks amazing, I love it.
Your turn.
What? No.
Come on. I saw you eyeing that mermaid with the harpoon.
And if my mom ever found out I got a tattoo, she'd harpoon me.
So get a small one. In a place she'll never see.
What does this one mean?
That is the Japanese symbol for courage.
It's got your name on it.
No, but it could. Have a seat.
Could you hold my phone?
Where do you want it?
Maybe right...here.
It's just really tender.
Well, it ain't gonna hurt any less with a needle in it.
How about something a little closer to the good China?
Un-friggin'-believable.
Radley has files on patients who've been dead
since the Stone Age but nothing from six stupid years ago?
Stop. I found it.
C. DiLaurentis. I got it.
What's it say?
Spencer, talk to me. Is he dead or not?
Yeah, he's dead.
What am I looking at?
It's a work order.
The courier who transported his organs.
So what? That doesn't mean squat.
Hanna, you can't donate your heart, liver and both kidneys
and still play Boggle in the Radley rec room, he's dead.
Well, someone is pretending to be him, so who is it?
Who is Charles?
I don't know.
This is just a bunch of medical files.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God. Is that a kneecap?
Don't touch it.
Why would I touch it?
Spencer, where are you going?
If you leave me alone here, I--
Just shut up. I'm just getting something to fish it out.
Fish it out? I don't wanna see what it's connected to.
Spencer. Spencer, stop. Please, stop.
Breathe, breathe, it's a doll.
What?
It's a Resusci Anne.
Well, w-w-what-what is that? Like a-a blowup thingy?
No, you blow into it, they use it to teach CPR.
What was that?
It's probably something you woke out of hibernation
with your screaming.
I totally could have dropped this off at church.
Why make you leave your house if you don't have to?
Because I want to...leave.
I don't even know how to apologize for him.
That was so wrong.
Alison, your father's not angry with me.
Or you.
He's angry with himself.
He failed to protect his own family and..
that's gotta hurt.
Well, it wouldn't hurt us as much if he'd just admit it.
Hey, did you notice who was on site today?
At the curb?
I got the goon who was on your beat
to trade shifts with another officer.
Her name's Lydia. She's nice.
You'll like her.
You didn't have to do that.
I wanted to.
We should probably call my mom, let her know we're on our way.
Sara, what's wrong?
I read the text you got.
From Aria.
What text?
I saw her too.
I've seen her a couple times.
When we went to Caleb's apartment..
...there was someone across the street in a black hoodie.
Okay, Sara, let's not do this here, okay?
We'll talk about it when we get home.
We'll be okay.
Sara. Sara, wait!
Spencer, come on. Like, could we just go?
I don't need any more proof he's dead.
We knew that already, but we don't know
who Charles was close to, who he hung out with.
We're never gonna know that.
Radley doesn't put out a yearbook.
Let's go.
Okay, that was definitely not an animal.
I'm leaving here now.
Sara.
Please, don't do this.
You've been looking all along, haven't you?
What?
For whoever had us down in that bunker.
Why didn't you want me to know?
Sara, we've been trying to protect you, okay?
I've been trying to protect you.
I need to protect myself.
I thought we were connecting. How could you keep this from me?
I had to. A threatened to hurt you if we told the police
what we found in that dollhouse.
I don't understand.
Sara, we're getting closer to figuring out
who this person is.
Soon, we'll know--
Oh, my God!
Come on!
What the hell, Mona?
Have you been down here the whole time?
Was that you?
Answer us!
Just let me go.
Please, I'll explain later.
No, you're gonna explain right now.
Why were you following us?
She didn't want us to find this.
Just give it back to me, okay?
This doesn't have anything to do with you guys.
Why were you stealing your file, Mona?
She wasn't.
She was stealing Lesli Stone's.
Wait, what? Lesli was a patient here too?
Yes, and she doesn't want it to go public.
Is that how you met her?
Lesli Stone was in Radley. When?
Judging from this, a long time.
Long enough to know Mona and Charles.
马上过来 有进展
I've got to go to Hanna's.
Why?
She's having a rough night.
She wants her friends around her.
Does she?
And will Lorenzo be there to comfort her too?
I've gotta go.
You are not going anywhere.
And if you keep this up, I will take you far away from here.
I mean it.
What?
You gonna bury me at Aunt Carol's farm too?
Shove me in the ground right next to Charles?
What are you talking about?
Am I crazy? That's a girl, right?
That's a bust and it's Leslie Stone's.
Hanna, stop. We barely know anything about that girl.
I mean, taking us down in a courtroom is not the same
as taking us down to that bunker.
Aria's right. I mean, why? Why would she torture us?
Because she's unstable, that's why.
That girl's got bigger mood swings than that..
Captain Hook ride at Hershey Park.
And you forgot to mention that she once shared a room
at Radley with Bethany Young.
What?
They were roommates
and probably pretty close.
Lesli must think that we helped Ali kill Bethany that night
and then dumped her body in that pit.
Your sister did that.
No.
Melissa just...buried her alive.
We still have no idea who bashed her over the head
and Lesli doesn't know any of it.
She probably thinks that Alison did the deed
and we helped her get rid of the body.
But why hide behind Charles's name?
Maybe she was just as close to Charles as she was to Bethany.
It all comes back to Charles.
So was Mona covering for Lesli?
I mean, by stealing her file.
Mona said she was doing it to repair their friendship.
Lesli's got her fooled too.
Or not.
What about Sara?
I mean, why would Lesli Stone go after a complete stranger?
It was probably just a rehearsal, Em.
Until she could get her hands on the real Alison.
Okay, so what do we do now?
Well, we know where she lives.
I say we catch her in the act.
How?
I did everything I could, Lesli, I swear.
Mona, what are you trying to say?
They know.
What? You're kidding. Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
I asked you to do one thing, Mona, one freaking thing
and you screwed it up. You screwed it up for me!
