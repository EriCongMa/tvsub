单身猫寐兮 静妹粒 ddj
hello , julius .
he &apos;s dead . he is dead .
good morning to you , too .
i swear , i think that i am gonna kill this little punk .
nice . okay .
who we killing ?
this , uh ,
kid in grace &apos;s math class--
his name is &apos; apane
and he &apos;s been texting her nonstop .
text , text , text , text ,
text , text .
how do you know he &apos;s been texting her ?
because i bought her a new cellular phone
and somehow in the family cloud share plan ,
whatever you call it ,
it got mixed up and i &apos;m receiving all of her text messages .
so you &apos;ve been spying on her .
i &apos;m not spying on my kid . what &apos;d i just say ?
number one . number two , it &apos;s called parenting ,
so you know .
it &apos;s also ... spying . all right ?
look , i didn &apos;t come here to , uh ...
what , you ... what the hell is that ? what are you doing ?
what ?
what do you mean , &quot; what ? &quot; you just put butter in your coffee .
yeah , it &apos;s grass @-@ fed butter . try it .
you out of milk ? you out of your mind ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
no , it &apos;s a , uh , it &apos;s a team guy thing .
we do it to boost energy , enhance brain function .
hey , enhance brain function-- you should try it .
maybe you &apos;ll think more clearly .
oh , thank you . i think i &apos;ll have my , uh ,
heart attack the old @-@ fashioned way .
well , suit yourself .
this kid again .
relentless . he is completely relentless .
listen to this one . i think you &apos;ll like it .
what is that ?
&quot; hey , g. &quot; her name &apos;s grace , first of all .
&quot; what &apos;s your favorite kind of candy ? &quot;
she says hershey &apos;s kisses .
he says , &quot; awesome . me , too . &quot; yeah .
you know why you think it &apos;s funny ?
because you don &apos;t understand subtext . subtext .
they &apos;re two kids talking about candy
the day before valentine &apos;s day .
romance is in the air , danny .
romance is in the air ?
romance is in the air .
no , romance is not in the air .
you know why ? because she &apos;s 12 .
there should not be any romance in her airspace , period .
would you listen to me for a minute , please ? relax .
just relax . she &apos;s a great kid .
you raised her right . you got to trust her .
i do trust her . i trust her very much .
it &apos;s him-- this little thug-- i don &apos;t trust .
all right . let &apos;s take him out .
okay , now you &apos;re talking .
mcgarrett .
we &apos;re on the way . we got to go .
sanitation crew came across the car this morning .
any witnesses ?
everyone was at the chinese new year &apos;s parade a block over .
dr. shaw .
what do we know ?
just the obvious .
the depth of the ligature marks around the victim &apos;s throat
suggest the assailant was very powerful and most likely male .
all right , what about t.o.d. ?
based on this stage of rigor ,
i &apos;d estimate between 10 : 00 p.m. and midnight .
anything on him ?
cash is still here .
all right , so this definitely wasn &apos;t a robbery .
california guy . uh , julius brennan .
what do you suppose this is for ?
what &apos;s that on his knee ? right knee .
some sort of grease stain .
looks fresh .
he was looking for something on the undercarriage here .
what , like a bomb ?
or a gps device .
all right , so whatever it was ,
this guy thought somebody was out to get him .
yeah , well , it looks like he was right .
as darkness falls on the embattled city of fallujah ,
the fighting has only intensified .
a short while ago , we were forced to pull back
and dig in here after taking heavy mortar fire
from the insurgent stronghold behind me .
brennan was an award @-@ winning freelance journalist
and documentarian .
mm . anybody bringing a camera to a gunfight got my respect .
you know , i got to know some of these embeds
when i was downrange .
i got to tell you , they &apos;re a special breed .
i mean , they &apos;re driven and they &apos;re committed ,
but ... they &apos;re crazy .
well , back in 2010 , he was seriously wounded
covering the genocide in the congo .
made a full recovery in the states .
all right , we know what he &apos;s been up to lately ?
yeah , two years ago ,
he published a series of freelance pieces
on the surge of violence in detroit .
he hasn &apos;t published anything since then .
what was he doing here on the island ?
don &apos;t know ,
but tsa has him arriving a week ago .
he purchased a one @-@ way ticket at lax
on the day of the flight .
all right , so , last @-@ minute trip to oahu--
doesn &apos;t sound like he was coming here to just chill out .
i agree with you .
chin , reach out to some of his previous employers ,
see if you can find out anything about him
working on a story while he was here .
well , if he was ,
could be the reason he was killed .
you seem upbeat today , dr. bergman .
oh , with very good reason .
tomorrow &apos;s valentine &apos;s day , and i have planned
a romantic evening
with my lovely paramour sabrina .
man &apos;s got game . i like it .
and may i ask what cupid has in store for you ?
i have a date with my kindle
and a nice bottle of cab .
ah , how wonderfully pathetic .
是爱情及癫痫瘟疫等领域的守护神
what &apos;s pathetic is a made @-@ up commercial holiday
dedicated to the patron saint of not only love ,
but of epilepsy , fainting and the plague .
well , romantics , such as myself , view
valentine &apos;s day as a perfect opportunity
to express our true feelings for the one we love .
saint valentine was brutally murdered by a roman emperor .
where &apos;s the love in that ?
max ?
you ever seen anything like this before ?
never .
max , what are we looking at here ?
what is this , some kind of message from the killer ?
more like a message from our vic .
the angle of the handwriting
indicates mr. brennan wrote on himself .
it &apos;s called hypergraphia .
it &apos;s a behavioral condition
characterized by an intense desire to write .
it &apos;s a symptom associated with temporal lobe
epilepsy and can be triggered
by high @-@ stress life events .
he &apos;s had plenty of those .
yeah , or maybe the stress of
thinking somebody &apos;s out to kill you .
looks like a code .
that was my first assumption as well ,
until i took a closer look .
the words are backwards .
&quot; isolated , desolate ,
&quot; solitary , trepidation , dismay , consternation .
3.14 pi infinity ... &quot;
what does this mean ? do you guys understand this ?
it actually makes sense that it doesn &apos;t make sense .
think of it as nervous doodling ,
a frenzied firing of neurons in the brain .
some people who suffer from hypergraphia
write in a coherent and logical manner .
others , like mr. brennan ,
have a more jumbled style .
yeah , kono ?
we tracked down the motel room that our vic was staying in .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what i &apos;m looking at .
actually , i bet i can .
i really hope that brennan left
a credit card for the incidentals .
well , hpd found the place tossed
when they arrived ,
but whoever let themselves in--
they did a number on his camera and his laptop .
they took the memory card and the hard drive .
and probably anything else
that could tell us what he was up to .
well , they didn &apos;t take his words .
maybe there &apos;s something in all of this that can
help clue us in to what got him killed .
look , i &apos;m not naive .
i knew that eventually this was gonna happen .
you know , it was inevitable my daughter &apos;s
gonna start talking to boys .
i get it , she &apos;s 12 .
but , uh , i did not think that i would have a , um ,
a front @-@ row seat to the , uh ,
prepubescent pillow talk .
you know ? and the emojis-- forget about it .
i mean , i can &apos;t tell you how much time i spent trying
to decipher what , uh ,
birthday cake , puppy dog ,
thumbs @-@ up means , you know ? so ...
i &apos;m sorry , sir . what is this about ?
what is it about ?
are you ... are you listening to me ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t want my daughter &apos;s text messages
to come on my phone anymore .
unfortunately , this is customer service .
i &apos;ll have to transfer you to technical support .
please hold .
can ... ?
you know , therapy is an option .
you know that , right ?
call the governor , get you back in .
you know when i was a kid ,
if i liked a girl ,
i had to go up and talk to her , right ,
like , with my mouth , a human being .
now , any kid with thumbs ,
a family share plan , gets to walk around
thinking they &apos;re the mack .
the mack ? you say &quot; the mack ? &quot;
讲述刚出狱黑人被迫卷入俩白人警察与黑道老大的战争中
the mack , yeah . i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s the smooth jazz , baby .
it &apos;s got me thinking about the &apos; 90s , you know ?
listen to me , would you ?
you &apos;re doing the right thing .
giving grace some space is good .
please continue to hold .
your expected wait time is 38 minutes .
38 minutes ? 38 minutes , 38 seconds-- more of this music ,
i &apos;m gonna kill myself .
grace isn &apos;t gonna have a father .
i can &apos;t .
okay . i guess , uh ,
doing the right thing is gonna have to wait , right ?
special friend , or secret admirer ?
actually , i bought them for myself .
i know . it &apos;s pathetic , right ?
the popular conspiracy theory is that
valentine &apos;s day was created by the candy ,
floral and greeting card industries
to inflate sales .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard that one .
i think it &apos;s cynical .
people go through their lives ,
rarely taking time to say &quot; i love you , &quot;
so ... what &apos;s one day a year when you &apos;re forced
to be nice to each other
and acknowledge those who are important to us ?
wow , jerry , that &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a really beautiful sentiment .
well , i can ...
go deep every once in a while .
here . give it to someone you care about .
thanks .
i will .
max is expecting you .
ah , mr. ortega ,
what brings you to my room
of post @-@ mortal wonder ?
i came for the photos of the writing on the victim &apos;s body .
i &apos;ve been asked to use my considerable skills
to mine the words for possible clues .
i could have saved you a trip by e @-@ mailing you those files .
right , pictures of a dead body
sent to my e @-@ mail address over the internet .
no , thank you .
i assure you , our network is secure .
you do realize we &apos;re all naked ,
living with millions of strangers
from all over the world , in a giant glass house
called the &quot; internet . &quot;
i prefer to keep my clothes on .
i prefer that , as well .
allow me to retrieve the photos .
so , uh ,
when you , uh , cut &apos; em open
and , uh , rip out the insides ,
what do you do with the brains ?
well , sometimes , we place them into the body cavity
before they &apos;re closed up .
on occasion , we send them over
to research or diagnostic testing .
so , it is possible ?
what &apos;s possible ?
walt disney , marilyn monroe ,
andy kaufman , jim morrison--
和死于27岁的摇滚歌手
their brains could be out there somewhere
cryogenically frozen , waiting for modern science
to figure out a way to implant them into a new body .
urban legend , my friend .
right .
you keep telling yourself that .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing . between a predator texting my daughter
and this animal putting grass @-@ fed butter
in his coffee , everything &apos;s fantastic .
really ? i read somewhere that that boosts energy
and enhances brain function .
did you ?
okay , chin , we find anything ?
take a look at this .
i ran julius &apos;s financials ,
and got a hit on a credit card receipt
from a restaurant he was at last night .
looks like he was dining with someone .
all right , but his buddy goes the other direction .
i find it hard to believe that he doubles back
and beats brennan to his car .
well , maybe ...
maybe this guy &apos;s job was to lure brennan into the restaurant
and keep him there while somebody else got in the car .
all right . well , let &apos;s see if his friend pops up in our system .
ben hamilton ,
u.s. department of state . looks likes his last assignment
was the u.s. embassy in the congo .
2009 through 2011 .
okay , brennan was on assignment there the same time .
so , it &apos;s safe to assume they knew each other .
doesn &apos;t mean they liked each other .
yeah , of course i know julius .
we were friends .
i just had dinner with the guy last night .
what the hell happened ?
we were hoping you could tell us .
how did you two know each other ?
we met in the congo a few years back .
i was assigned to the u.s. embassy as a cultural attache .
he was in country covering the civil war .
julius was committed
to showing the world what was going on over there .
so , you were there when he was wounded ?
spring of 2010 . yeah .
a rebel militia advanced to within a few miles of kinshasa .
they were slaughtering anyone who got in their way .
women , children , it didn &apos;t matter .
the state department
called for the evacuation of all press and embassy personnel ,
but julius ...
julius-- he wouldn &apos;t go .
he was there to get a story , and nothing was gonna stop him .
until he caught a sniper round in the chest .
almost died . he was lucky .
ended up with a collapsed lung ,
a few broken ribs , but that bullet missed his heart
by a fraction of an inch .
mm @-@ hmm . you know what he was doing here on oahu ?
said he was here on vacation .
called me up out of the blue , invited me to dinner .
i hadn &apos;t even talked to the guy in a year or two .
what did you two talk about ?
caught up a bit ,
did some reminiscing about africa .
but i got to be honest .
the guy sitting across the table from me last night
is not the julius i knew .
it was strange .
he was distracted , paranoid .
he kept looking around .
tried to talk to him about it ,
to ask him what was going on ,
but he just changed the subject .
i got to say , when i left , i was a little worried about the guy .
he talk about seeing anyone else while he was here ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
if anything , i was afraid
that julius might be headed for some kind of a breakdown .
i never thought he &apos;d be murdered .
so , julius brennan had a lot on his mind .
that explains the hypergraphia .
yeah , and i don &apos;t believe he was here on vacation , either .
so , why didn &apos;t he tell hamilton
exactly why he was really on oahu ?
well , maybe he didn &apos;t trust him .
he checked the undercarriage of his car after their meeting .
and the handshake on that video doesn &apos;t exactly look
like two old friends saying good @-@ bye to each other .
and come on . cultural attaché .
i bet the cia has to give a class
on how to say that with a straight face .
right .
all right , i &apos;ll ask mcgarrett to reach out to his contacts .
see what else they can tell us about our mr. hamilton .
hey , jerry , what do you got ?
i &apos;m not exactly sure ,
but i kept noticing this recurring symbol
in the writing on brennan &apos;s body .
the arrow of sagittarius .
oh , like the constellation ?
i didn &apos;t know you were a fellow astronomy buff .
we should get up to diamond head one night
and do some stargazing .
pass , but thanks for the invite .
okay . well ,
anyway , uh , in this case ,
uh , the arrow is referring to the zodiac symbol
of ancient babylonian origin representing the soldier .
and then we found these two names recurring
in a few of the spirals
on the walls of the hotel room .
any idea who they are ?
not &quot; they . &quot; &quot; he . &quot;
you know , at first , i thought they were two different people ,
&apos;cause they never appear together .
there was always words in between them .
then i ran the two names together ,
and this is what i found .
patrice thomas , congolese national .
fled to the u.s. in late 2009
after he was granted refugee status .
and he settled in oahu a little over a year ago .
another guy from the congo .
brennan had to know him .
we got to find him .
kid was a good employee .
his boss said it wasn &apos;t like him not to call ,
so he came over to check on him
when he was a no @-@ show for his valet parking job .
landlord lets him in ,
they find him like this .
duke &apos;s busy checking on whether
he &apos;s got any next of kin on the island .
liver temp puts time of death at roughly 12 hours ago .
and take a look at this .
absence of bruising tells me ...
he was struck in the face right before he died .
he &apos;s been doing this a while .
all right , this is very strange . uh , dope fiends
do not usually keep such a tidy apartment .
they certainly do not alphabetize their bookshelves , all right ?
kid &apos;s got no track marks on him , either .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the arrow of sagittarius .
scar tissue is deep and well @-@ defined .
this mark must have been here for a few years .
if i didn &apos;t know any better ,
i &apos;d say this guy &apos;s been branded .
all right , so somebody comes in here ,
try to make this thing look like an overdose .
i &apos;m assuming whoever did this did not
want us to tie this kid to julius brennan .
yeah , well ... that scar just did .
they came at night
when we were sleeping .
we woke to the screams of our parents .
we ran to their room .
there were men .
they had machetes .
they stood ov ...
they stood over the bodies of my parents .
blood dripping from their blades .
wesley started to wail .
i tried to keep him quiet , but i couldn &apos;t .
one of the soldiers got angry ,
raised the machete over his head ,
but before he could strike ,
i yelled at him to stop .
i pleaded with him .
told him
if he spared my brother &apos;s life ...
i would join makoni &apos;s army .
you &apos;re a special guy , patrice .
you survived in roko makoni &apos;s army for four years .
but then you escaped and ...
and found your little brother again .
where will you go now ?
what will you do if you can &apos;t make it to america ?
we would rather die than stay here .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
and i promise you ,
i &apos;m gonna tell your story ,
and we will show the world
who roko makoni is
and all the horrible things that he has done .
the interview was part of the documentary
that brennan was making before he was injured in the congo .
uh , we got it from a film editor he was working with .
who the hell is this roko makoni guy ?
a congolese warlord .
they call him the chief .
at one time , he was the most wanted man in the world .
what do you mean , &quot; was &quot; ?
makoni was killed in a bombing
by the congolese air force back in 2011 .
smart money says
the air strike was orchestrated by the cia .
apparently , makoni co @-@ opted the arrow of sagittarius
as a brand to mark his army of kidnapped child soldiers .
so ...
patrice escapes makoni &apos;s army ,
comes to america where he thinks he &apos;ll be safe ,
and is murdered .
probably by the same people who killed julius brennan .
but who would want both of these guys dead ?
i may have the answer to that .
patrice &apos;s phone records show
that he and brennan were in contact with each other
beginning a week ago .
he also sent encrypted photos to brennan &apos;s cell phone ,
photos that the crime lab just sent over .
but if brennan came to see patrice ,
why wouldn &apos;t he tell hamilton that ?
i think the better question is :
why didn &apos;t hamilton tell us ?
he &apos;s got to figure into this somehow .
that &apos;s the hotel where patrice worked .
okay , i don &apos;t get it . an empty cab .
chin , do me a favor . pull up that license plate .
guys , that &apos;s makoni .
no , that &apos;s impossible .
roko makoni was confirmed k.i.a.
in an air strike .
confirmed by the government .
looks like reports of his death were greatly exaggerated .
all right , my team , bring it in .
bring it in . let &apos;s go .
the target is roko makoni .
he &apos;s a highly skilled ,
battle @-@ tested soldier .
this man is a major threat .
he has no conscience .
so stay focused and maintain situational awareness at all times .
okay , my team .
this is our target .
his name is ben hamilton .
we &apos;re assuming he &apos;s a retired cia case officer .
he is intelligent , he is well @-@ trained ,
and he &apos;s not gonna go down without a fight .
he &apos;s also the guy that reported putting eyes
on makoni &apos;s corpse , verified that in 2011
makoni was killed in an air strike .
now , we believe
that hamilton faked makoni &apos;s death ,
provided him safe passage to the u.s.
in exchange for makoni &apos;s cache of blood diamonds .
all right , everybody .
these two threats have everything to lose .
so execute good target i.d. and muzzle discipline .
any questions ?
all right , good .
let &apos;s go to work .
hands up .
do it now !
i think we all know
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
it &apos;s over , hamilton !
you &apos;re out of options .
i knew this day would come .
a man like makoni
could never outrun his past .
you aided and abetted an international war criminal .
hands over your head .
whatever you do ,
don &apos;t underestimate the chief .
even the devil &apos;s afraid of him .
enough ! last time !
hands over your head !
gun !
move !
clear !
stop it .
stop it .
get out .
get out . get out !
get out !
all right , once he turns off of kuhio toward the ala wai ,
the cameras don &apos;t pick him up again .
he had to have ditched the car
somewhere in the neighborhood .
he did . hpd just found the car
abandoned near beretania park .
they &apos;re canvassing house to house .
okay , well , makoni &apos;s place is compromised ,
his picture &apos;s all over the tv , hamilton is dead .
where does he go from here ?
well , it &apos;s not in his dna to surrender .
and he &apos;s not gonna allow himself to be captured .
he &apos;d rather die .
makoni &apos;s a soldier .
i mean , he &apos;s a field general .
he &apos;s gotta have an extraction plan .
trust me , he &apos;s imagined
this scenario at least 1,000 times ,
and whatever he &apos;s got planned ,
we &apos;ll never see coming .
only thing we can be certain of
is he knows he &apos;s not getting off this island
without some sort of leverage .
royal hawaiian center , please .
come .
if we don &apos;t get to him before he has that leverage ,
we &apos;re not gonna have to look
too hard to find him .
excuse me .
i , uh ...
i think we &apos;re going the wrong way .
sir ?
what are you doing ?
open this door !
you hear me ?
no !
what &apos;d he do to you ?
my name is roko makoni .
i &apos;d like to speak to commander steve mcgarrett .
all units be advised ,
hostage situation on the corner of kapuni and cleghorn .
commander mcgarrett has tactical lead .
police are evacuating the scene .
bomb squad is en route .
understand me , commander mcgarrett .
if these people die , it &apos;s on you .
you know what i want .
the helicopter is being fueled as we speak ,
and everything you &apos;ve asked for is in motion .
all right , now , i need to know
how the man in the backseat is doing .
if i were you ,
i &apos;d be more worried about the c @-@ 4
in my trunk .
i am worried .
okay ? i am worried .
but i also want to send a doctor out there
to check on that man &apos;s wounds .
so you understand what i &apos;m saying to you ?
in a few minutes , he won &apos;t matter .
he &apos;s got nothing to do with this .
he does not need to die .
all right .
you care so much , you come .
i &apos;m not a doctor .
today , you will have to be .
steve ?
hey . you sure this is a good idea ?
that &apos;s a stupid question .
hey . be careful .
oh , no , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s not in his vocabulary .
he doesn &apos;t know that one .
i need to open the back door , please . okay ?
can i open the door ?
i &apos;m watching you .
it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be all right .
i need to get this man out of here right now .
you still have two hostages .
close the door .
close the door .
get on your knees .
do it !
please , please , don &apos;t !
easy . easy .
you think i &apos;m a monster ,
don &apos;t you ?
that makes it simple for you .
monsters aren &apos;t real .
you are .
you see , i wasn &apos;t born into the privilege of your country .
i was born in a place where there is no living .
you survive or you die .
i gave those children a purpose .
a cause .
something to believe in .
&quot; a cause &quot; ?
that &apos;s what you call kidnapping and rape ? murder ?
&quot; a cause &quot; ?
our enemies are swayed more by fear than reverence .
you put guns and machetes in the hands of children
and turn them into killers .
i turned them into soldiers !
do you know why you &apos;re here ?
&apos;cause i wanted you here .
i wanted to look into your eyes
and hear you say you agree to my demands .
okay , well , i &apos;ve done everything you asked .
i have seen many men
cower under the shadow of a blade or the barrel of a gun .
your actions may be that of a brave man , commander .
but your eyes tell me you are a liar !
do it .
good work , kono .
not too many people in this world can
make that shot the way that you can .
so , the question is : why is he still breathing ?
because a bullet to the head would &apos;ve been way too easy for him .
all right !
the bomb squad has the crime scene !
i need all nonessential personnel to clear this area right now !
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go !
patch that shoulder up .
he &apos;s got a long flight to the hague .
you and i will see each other again .
i hope so .
let &apos;s go ! get them out of there right now !
come on ! go ! clear !
clear ! clear !
let &apos;s go ! back !
could &apos;ve killed you .
to be honest , i wasn &apos;t really thinking abut that .
oh , no ?
oh , that &apos;s funny .
we did good today , buddy .
yeah , we did .
well , what now ?
wha @-@ what happened ?
he offer to carry her books ?
no , no , no , no . he &apos;s , uh ...
he &apos;s taking her for an ice cream .
&quot; an ice cream &quot; ?
yeah .
would you listen to me ?
you got to stop this . it &apos;s ice cream .
i understand .
you &apos;re making yourself crazy over nothing .
danny ... - she lied to me . she lied to me .
she told me she was going over to a friend &apos;s to study .
so she is now lying .
all right , this , uh , this ends now .
let &apos;s go .
try it again , okay ?
you can &apos;t mess up , okay ?
ready ?
this way .
one , two , three ...
okay , let &apos;s try it again .
one , two , three , slap .
one ...
under !
okay , ready ?
okay , one more time .
one more time .
i wouldn &apos;t be standing here
if it weren &apos;t for my brother &apos;s courage .
we were just boys when they took him .
for four years , he survived that hell .
he didn &apos;t even know what he was fighting for .
every night ,
i &apos;d pray that he &apos;ll find a ... his way out .
and one day ...
i opened up my eyes .
and he &apos;s there .
standing over me with that ...
with that big , silly smile .
we never stopped living in fear of the chief .
even after mr. brennan helped us escape to america .
we heard of makoni &apos;s death .
but with no body , we never quite believed he was dead .
patrice and julius brennan
died trying to bring makoni to justice .
there &apos;s nothing more noble than that .
your brother was a hero .
he &apos;s with my parents now .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re very proud .
you see , danny .
raising kids is a lot like grilling burgers .
you can &apos;t poke them and prod them too much .
all you can do is just watch them closely
and be there when the flames jump up .
that &apos;s it !
there you go .
that &apos;s fantastic . steve ?
yeah ?
you got to hear this .
grover is comparing , uh , raising children
to , uh , making hamburgers .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
i like it .
you like it ?
i like it .
right .
&apos;cause the analogy is free , like ,
uh , the @-@ the booze is free .
the beers are free . everything is free .
a little tip from the pro .
oh , boy .
rotate the patties 90 degrees on each side .
get them fancy , cross @-@ hatch grill marks .
presentation is everything , brah .
here &apos;s a little tip for you .
how about you stick to sauteing
them sea creatures ,
and let the guy from chicago handle the beef ?
my bad , og .
you know you &apos;re staring , right ?
i &apos;m pretty sure dr. shaw and i had
a moment yesterday in the morgue .
hey ! if it happened in the morgue , it wasn &apos;t a moment .
well , he does bring up a good point , jer .
there &apos;s a wide spectrum of moments ranging
from love at first sight to restraining order .
which is it ?
hey , only one way to find out , brother .
come on , what you gonna do ?
i &apos;m going in .
so am i.
what &apos;s he doing ?
jerry is gonna put the moves on the good doctor over there .
i don &apos;t like it .
eye of the tiger , jer .
i think he gets shot down pretty quickly .
$ 20 say you &apos;re wrong .
all right .
i don &apos;t want to bet against my guy , but okay .
put me down with ten large .
10,000 ?
for me-- ten , ten .
guys , what are you betting on ?
well , you look at that .
oh , see , now , that is a bold move .
do your thing , big sexy .
that man has got game .
and that &apos;s why you owe me $ 20 .
fair enough .
he got game , man .
i &apos;ll gladly pay .
thank you .
very impressed .

i &apos;m proud of you , all right ?
it pains me to say it , but you were right .
you were right . um ,
she is a good kid and i just need to trust her .
not for nothing .
but , uh , it looks like the romance might be on the rocks .
go talk to her .
hold that , will you ?
you know , you &apos;re a lot cuter when you &apos;re smiling .
what &apos;s going on ?
i have to tell you something , danno .

i was eating ice cream with a boy i like .
i lied to you .

i &apos;m glad you told me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i felt terrible lying to you .
well , look , i &apos;d , uh ,
i &apos;d be concerned if you didn &apos;t feel terrible , okay ?
and i @-@ i have a confession to make , too . um ...
i , uh , i could see all your , uh ,
text messages .
something goofy was going on with that phone .
so i could see , uh , i could see you were going
to have ice cream with him and you weren &apos;t studying .
um , and i went there and i saw you and ...
you seemed , uh ,
you seemed like you were having a really good time .
