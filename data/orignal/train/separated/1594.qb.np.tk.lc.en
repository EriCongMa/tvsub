so you can go on the tour .
but i want to go to idyllwild .
classical music has been everything .
what kind of idiot breaks into somebody &apos;s house
in the middle of the night ?
i snuck out so i could see jude , all right ? !
what does that mean ?
we had some girls come into our tent .
we ended up making out with them .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about
me and connor hanging out .
because his dad said we &apos;re not allowed to be friends anymore , ok .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
why ... would you ... ?
sometimes i just wanna die .
as soon as you &apos;re emancipated we can adopt you right away .
and you do need to keep this from robert ,
which we don &apos;t feel good about .
i &apos;m ana &apos;s daughter .
we didn &apos;t even know that you existed until it was too late .
you were already adopted .
i met our grandparents .
you did ?
i tried to get them to take ana &apos;s baby .
you &apos;re decided , 100 percent ?
once i give her to stef and lena ,
she &apos;s gonna grow up in a wonderful home
with her brother and sister .
remember we decided not to tell the kids about the baby ?
well , we might want to get on that .
is she gonna be here the whole time ?
like , when is she having this baby ?
we &apos;re really not quite sure , sweetheart .
well , when is she due ?
six weeks .
i &apos;m supposed to give up my room for six weeks ?
hi , ana , um ... can i get you some coffee ?
are you still drinking coffee ?
um , tea ?
yeah , we can do that .
you can sit there . jude &apos;s still asleep .
i don &apos;t wanna put brandon out .
oh , no , it &apos;s fine , really . not a big deal .
uh , ana can i get you something to eat , some eggs ... maybe ?
oh , thank you . the smell makes me a little ...
sick ? i remember that .
oh , mama , did we hear anything from st. tristan &apos;s yet ?
are they gonna loan us their auditorium for the dance @-@ off monday ?
yes , they are .
excellent !
oh , there are two dance teams for the school
but only one can represent at states .
so we &apos;re doing a dance @-@ off so the students can decide .
oh , that sounds exciting .
and stressful .
it &apos;s become , like , a thing ,
and now the whole student body wants to come .
oh , please , you love it .
shut up .
hey , language , please .
when you were little , anytime i &apos;d put music on ,
you &apos;d wear one of my old t @-@ shirts
like a dress and you &apos;d dance all around .
and , of course , we had to watch you or you &apos;d get so mad .
really ? i don &apos;t remember that .
i do . and some things never change .
so , jesus , i spoke with the recruiter from flintwood .
he &apos;s going to come and sit down with us tonight .
really ?
oh , jesus might go to boarding school .
yes , might .
don &apos;t get yourself all worked up . we &apos;re just gonna hear him out .
ok .
callie , can i make you some toast ?
or something else to eat ?
no , i &apos;m ok .
i gotta get ready . robert &apos;ll be here soon .
i &apos;m gonna finish getting ready for work .
i &apos;m really excited about the baby .
well , i &apos;m just really glad your moms decided to take her .
hey , callie ? i know this is hard .
i &apos;m ok .
ok .
hopefully we &apos;ll get you emancipated before you
have to spend another weekend with the quinns .
but , until then , just please remember
that you can &apos;t say anything .
i know .
ok .
i hate how ugly this has gotten .
i know . you don &apos;t approve .
but i &apos;m just trying to keep callie under this roof .
what &apos;s gonna happen if ana &apos;s parents decide
they wanna take this baby ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i went back to see our grandparents .
why ?
she asked them to take this baby .
moms want it .
ok , yeah , i know that moms want the baby . now .
i think you should just tell moms , ok .
in case they try to fight them for it or something .
ok , it &apos;s a her . and they &apos;re not going to .
they &apos;re gonna be relieved . because they &apos;re old .
they don &apos;t want to have to raise a child if they don &apos;t have to .
trust me . i &apos;ve got this .
it &apos;s just a casual lunch with my dad and his wife .
they want to meet you .
hi .
oh , my god . sophia !
you told her .
uh , yeah , sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
i guess you &apos;ve probably had enough surprises from me .
too soon ?
maybe a little .
ok ...
how are you ?
good . really .
and happy to be home .
look , i &apos;m wearing your ...
oh , yeah . they look really nice .
i love them . thank you .
yeah , no , of course .
i &apos;m really glad to see you .
yeah , i &apos;m really glad to see you , too .
come here .
excuse me , i &apos;m looking for connor stevens &apos;s room ?
and you are ... ?
his cousin .
uh , 325 . down the hall .
what are you doing here ?
i told your mom i don &apos;t want you hanging around connor .
i know .
i wanna see him . i wanna see my friend .
and i &apos;m not leaving until i do .
she &apos;ll grow up in a great , big family with ,
like , the two best moms in the world .
and i know ana tried really hard to keep you apart from us ,
but i know my moms &apos;ll want you to know the baby ,
and us , if you want .
right ?
what ? yeah , sure , ok .
and ana &apos;s staying with us , until the baby &apos;s born
so you don &apos;t have to worry about her .
i mean , if you were .
so everything &apos;s gonna work out fine .
of course .
who makes those ?
oh , i do .
it &apos;s a family tradition , one for every child and grandchild .
wow . there &apos;s a lot of &apos; em ...
you think , maybe one day , we could meet them ?
i think that could probably be arrang .
well , we should probably get home ,
but thank you for the bunuelos , they were delicious .
adios .
ok , bye .
nice to see you .
nice to see you .
they &apos;re good kids . their moms are doing a good job .
but are you really ok with that family
raising another one of our grandchildren ?
they call it a personality disorder ,
which makes me laugh &apos; cause i feel like it sounds like
i think i &apos;m the queen of england or something ,
which it &apos;s totally not .
i mean , it &apos;s a chemical imbalance , an illness ,
it &apos;s not something that i have to be ...
be ashamed of , right ?
right . it just made me feel so hopeless .
like i was never gonna be normal .
i know what it &apos;s like to feel hopeless , so ...
i &apos;m sorry .
so , where is my favorite girl ?
papa !
oh , sweetie , oh . it is so go to see you back home .
let me look at you .
pretty as a picture .
dad . this is callie .
callie , this is my father , robert senior .
callie . it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
wow , it &apos;s true ,
you two are the spitting image of each other !
my goodness !
this is my wife .
monica .
if we just pull a little from here and slide it there
we should be able to cover the expenses we &apos;re red @-@ lining until ,
fingers crossed , we get the kilfer grant .
when do you think we &apos;ll hear ?
any day now , i think .
you ok ? you look a little stressed .
i mean , as stressed , as someone as beautiful as you can look .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
stef moved ana into the house .
stef did ? by herself ?
i guess she was living somewhere really terrible ,
and , so , stef packed her up and moved her home .
without talking to you ?
yeah , well , she &apos;s been doing a lot of that lately .
i &apos;m sorry . my ex was a bit of a one man band .
i didn &apos;t get much of a say in anything .
finally , i just had to leave him .
not that our situations are the same .
we just weren &apos;t right for each other .
yeah , sometimes i think that &apos;s why i lost the baby .
because i knew we weren &apos;t gonna make it .
well , a newborn can test the best of marriages .
you have to be in a good place .
oh . it &apos;s connor &apos;s dad .
hello ?
that &apos;s a beautiful piece , b.
what &apos;s it , chopin ?
brahms ? what ?
uh , well , first off , it &apos;s a contemporary piece .
and ... i composed it .
get out . are you sure you &apos;re my son ?
i don &apos;t know , i just figured if idyllwild sees i can compose ,
they might cut me some slack on the playing .
you gotta get outta your head .
you &apos;re gonna blow &apos; em away .
hey , what should i have for the lady from idyllwild on monday ?
i mean , coffee , tea ? something to snack on ?
i think anything &apos;s fine .
thanks for letting me do it here .
i didn &apos;t want her coming to the house .
you still haven &apos;t told your mom yet , huh ?
no , i just don &apos;t want everyone finding out if i don &apos;t get in ...
so you can still go on tour ?
no . no , lou &apos;s ... we &apos;re done .
there &apos;s not gonna be any tour . for me , anyway .
i just hope i didn &apos;t blow it all for nothing .
look , b , you wanna play dive bars ,
i &apos;ll be at every gig .
but this is special , b.
this is your gift . it &apos;s not nothin &apos; .
i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee ,
and when i come back , he needs to be gone ,
otherwise i &apos;m gonna call security .
i know how hard this must be for you , honey , i do .
losing a friend is one of the most painful things to go through .
mr. stevens made it very clear ...
he &apos;s not my friend .
connor &apos;s not your friend ?
there were no girls .
in the tent . on the camping trip .
it was just us . we kissed .
and now we &apos;re kinda like ...
more than friends ?
connor ... he told his dad ...
whatcha doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m putting these programmable lights on our dance costumes . see ?
what does that mean ? programmable ?
oh , emma and i are writing code
so the lights change in time to the choreography .
writing code ?
it &apos;s how you tell computers what to do .
you &apos;re so smart . i never even finished high school .
why ? why &apos;d you drop out ? what happened ?
i fell in with the wrong crowd , i guess . we got into drugs .
you know , for most of my friends , it was just fun ,
but for me , once i got started ,
once i knew i could shut down all my feelings ,
there was no going back .
why did you want to shut down your feelings ?
i don &apos;t know . my mother was really strict with me .
i was the only girl
with three older brothers who could do no wrong .
and i just felt like my mother
gave them everything they wanted and , me , not so much .
so i rebelled , you know ?
i mean , i know now , she was hard on me
because she thought she had to be .
it &apos;s really hard being a girl in this world .
i &apos;m really glad you &apos;ve been raised by two strong , independent women .
i hope you know you can do anything
if you set your mind to it .
what ?
the baby &apos;s kicking ... hard .
you want to feel ?
that &apos;s so cool .
it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got a little alien in there .
that &apos;s nothing . think how it felt with two aliens in there .
oh , emma &apos;s here to help .
ow ! oh , my god ! ow !
jesus !
not too fast .
yeah , slow down .
let &apos;s get her onto the couch .
can you walk on it ?
i don &apos;t know .
be careful .
how many times have moms told you
not to leave your skateboard in the house ? !
get her leg up .
oh , my god , without six dancers ,
we &apos;re gonna have to forfeit .
oh , no . i &apos;m not letting kaitlyn win .
what &apos;re you gonna do ? pull a dancer outta thin air ?
are you gonna get that ?
oh , yeah , sorry .
jesus . sorry to stop by unannounced ...
is ana in ?
um , yeah . come in .
sophia , your father tells me you &apos;re getting rid of quincy ?
what &apos;s that about ?
uh , sophia just has so many activities now .
she loves to ride .
what about all those ribbons and the medals that you won ?
i &apos;m sorry papa , i know you gave him to me ,
but i just feel bad
cause i don &apos;t ride him as much as i used to .
he &apos;s going to a charity
where kids want to learn ride .
he &apos;s gonna get a lot of love and attention .
yeah .
i think that &apos;s great .
kids &apos; interests change , robert , as they grow up .
thank goodness ,
or i &apos;d be sitting here in a macrame dress .
well , i just think it &apos;s interesting , the timing of all these changes .
dad ...
i &apos;m just saying , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a coincidence .
and , callie , i mean you no offense .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a lovely young lady .
but imagine how sophia must feel .
now you have another daughter ,
you &apos;re totally obsessed with .
i &apos;m not obsessed .
you &apos;re trying to get custody , aren &apos;t you ?
as if sophia wasn &apos;t enough .
this has nothing to do with how much we love sophia .
it &apos;s ok , papa . i love having a sister .
sweetheart you tried to kill yourself .
dad , enough . i love both my daughters .
i wouldn &apos;t even be in this position if you hadn &apos;t forced me
to choose between her mother and this family .
oh , here we go ,
we all know how i &apos;ve ruined you life .
that &apos;s not what i said .
i love my wife . and god knows i &apos;ve put you through so much .
i don &apos;t deserve you .
you didn &apos;t ruin my life , dad .
but do you have any idea how hard callie &apos;s has been ?
all the hell she &apos;s been through because i wasn &apos;t there for her ?
that &apos;s not my fault .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s mine .
because i didn &apos;t stand up to you .
is that what all this is about ?
you finally standing up to me .
by forcing a young lady
to come live with you , against her will ?
i &apos;m not forcing ...
you can &apos;t turn back time , robert .
you &apos;ve got regrets , well , son , so do we all .
this young lady is happy where she is .
so why are you putting her through more hell ?
you can &apos;t keep them apart forever , adam .
what about school ?
i &apos;m pulling him from anchor beach .
with just a few weeks left in the school year ?
he &apos;ll have to repeat the grade .
and then what ? you lock him up until he &apos;s 18 ?
look ... you can keep jude outside the door as long as you want ,
as long as you &apos;re willing to stand watch .
but what then ? you gonna keep all the boys outside the door ?
or you could try . but trust me , if you do ,
you &apos;ll be the one who ends up getting shut out .
i don &apos;t care that your son &apos;s gay .
i just don &apos;t want mine to be .
what &apos;s this ?
war paint .
i thought that if my moms didn &apos;t take the baby ,
maybe they would .
i &apos;m sorry , i should have told you .
so , is that why you &apos;re here ?
you wanna take my baby ?
no .
we &apos;re here ...
because we want you to keep your baby .
we want to help you .
any way you want .
you can come and stay with us , or ... maybe ...
you should be with your family , ana .
so should your child .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s too late .
stef and lena are taking her .
i can &apos;t ... i &apos;m sorry ...
no .
wow , is it hard to get my dad &apos;s wife to leave a party .
i &apos;m really sorry about what my dad said earlier .
it &apos;s ok .
no , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not .
i thought he &apos;d be on his best behavior , especially today .
he adores sophia .
that &apos;s obvious .
no , it &apos;s fine , honest ,
families are weird .
all of them .
i guess you really don &apos;t wanna be a part of this one now , huh ?
but i am ... part of you and sophia .
i don &apos;t wanna fight that anymore .
and for the record , i &apos;m mad at my mom .
that she lied to both of us .
yeah , well , she was just doing what she thought was best for you .
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; ...
you aren &apos;t the only one that made mistakes ,
so don &apos;t blame yourself .
if you knew about me , you woulda taken care of me .
and jude . i know that .
and it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love you . i do .
it &apos;s just the fosters , they &apos;re home , and they feel like home .
no matter what , just know
that i want you to be a part of my life .
to be my dad .
whatever happens , you can trust me , just know that ... honest .
i know . i do .
oh , robert , sorry . um , you have a call .
it &apos;s your lawyer .
oh , well , that was quite an afternoon , wasn &apos;t it ?
i just hope you know that everything that robert does ,
he does out of love for you .
i do . i do know that .
you &apos;re trying to get emancipated ?
well , hope to see you in the fall , young man .
see ya .
thank you .
so , can i go ?
let us talk about it , but ...
but he was very persuasive .
yes !
go do your homework .
how can we say no ?
what are you doing home , love ?
is everything ok ?
robert found out about the emancipation .
ok , what did he say ?
nothing . he just brought me home .
this is exactly what i was afraid of .
what do you think he &apos;s gonna do ?
there &apos;s nothing he can do .
it &apos;s gonna be ok . go inside . we &apos;ll be right in .
nothing he can do ?
didn &apos;t want to scare her .
she &apos;s already ...
shh , please .
she &apos;s already scared .
if robert goes to the judge with this ,
there &apos;s no question who &apos;s gonna get custody of callie .
it &apos;s ...
come in .
just wondered if you needed anything ?
no , i &apos;m good , thank you .
ok .
jesus .
are you serious about going to this boarding school ?
i think so . why ?
i don &apos;t know , i just ...
... you have such a wonderful family and home .
and i just wish i hadn &apos;t left mine when i was 15 . that &apos;s all .
sorry .
that &apos;s ok . well , night .
good night .
what &apos;re you doing ?
oh , callie &apos;s home
and we have to pull an all @-@ nighter .
can i talk to you ?
i &apos;ll be downstairs .
i think ana wants to keep the baby .
but i think the only reason she isn &apos;t is because of you .
what am i supposed to do ?
tell her it &apos;s ok .
and what about our moms ?
they &apos;ll understand .
they &apos;re doing this for you . everyone is .
you know what , i can &apos;t deal with this right now .
thanks to you , i &apos;ve got one day
to pull this dance @-@ off outta my ass .
you can barely walk . you &apos;re not gonna be able to dance .
oh , we &apos;ll see about that .
i like it . it &apos;s subtle .
got a minute ?
uh , no , not really , but good to know you &apos;re alive .
sorry . i was sulking .
ok . but i really do have somewhere to be .
i got a call from this a &amp; r guy a friend knows ,
负责发掘 训练歌手或艺人
he &apos;s at legit label .
he heard that demo we sent out to the clubs ,
and he wants to come to one of our la gigs .
he really likes the sound .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
so ...
you know , you can go to this program for a summer
and have fun or whatever ...
or you could come on tour , who knows what could happen .
we &apos;re good together .
i love you .
come on tour with me .
he , uh ... he had to loan the car to his moms .
one of them .
i offered to pick him up but he ...
why don &apos;t we just try him again ?
oh , hey . i was just about to leave for st. tristan &apos;s .
we can drive together
if you don &apos;t mind riding in my son &apos;s beat @-@ up volvo .
my car &apos;s in the shop .
i , uh , heard from the kilfer foundation ...
we got the grant !
oh , my god !
i &apos;m so excited .
so the last count of eight is :
chug , chug , down , out ,
cross and up ...
now that &apos;s a move i haven &apos;t seen before .
looks like the rumors are true .
i just wanted to say , break a leg .
oops , looks like you already did .
everything &apos;s set in the back .
i hope to hell you can pull this off .
because if she wins there is no god .
careful , we don &apos;t wanna show up drunk .
yeah , that would be quite the scandal .
what ?
ana &apos;s gonna be there .
mariana invited her .
how do you feel about that ?
fine ...
fine ?
really ?
no . no , not fine .
um ... nothing &apos;s fine right now .
tell me .
i just feel really awful saying this .
i &apos;m just not excited about this baby .
not like i was about frankie , you know .
i mean , i know i &apos;m going to love her , but right now ,
all i feel is overwhelmed ...
... and worried . about everything .
including my marriage .
oh , it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , don &apos;t be .
i should ... go .
uh , yeah . i &apos;ll see you there ...
mama better get here soon .
have you heard anything about connor ? how he &apos;s doing ?
i saw him . he &apos;s good .
you saw him ? i thought ...
he &apos;s my boyfriend .
oh , here she is .
right here , honey .
afraid you weren &apos;t gonna make it .
yeah , i got hung up at the office .
all right , everybody , let &apos;s get started .
first up , team one .
they stole our dystopian robot theme .
up next , team two .
i knew it , she &apos;s not dancing ,
they only have five , so we win .
wait , is that like a digital dancer ?
but , how did she do that ?
with her computer ?
is that like a projection ? they can &apos;t have a fake dancer .
can they ?
that looks so real , right ?
i can &apos;t believe she did all this with a computer !
our daughter is a genius !
hey . what &apos;s up ?
judge ringer &apos;s office called .
he wants to see you two and callie in his chambers .
how soon ?
how soon can you get there ?
i ... i &apos;m sorry . i have other appointments .
i &apos;m not going to be able to wait .
something must have happened . can we reschedule ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
i missed the bus on the way over here
and i forgot my phone at home .
i ... i had to run half the way over here .
thanks for driving us home .
oh , it &apos;s fine , i &apos;m sorry your moms couldn &apos;t stay to celebrate .
we will tonight .
you &apos;re welcome , by the way .
for what ?
if you hadn &apos;t tripped over my skateboard ,
you would have never come up with all that .
how did you make that dancer that wasn &apos;t there ?
oh , we um ... we used the motion sensors
from the video game console ,
and then we hacked it
so we could record emma doing the choreography in front of it ,
and then we just applied that
to one of the avatars we made to look like one of the dancers .
i have no idea what you just said .
i hope the baby is smart like you .
have you thought about keeping the baby ?
i mean , if you want to , i think you should .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m sorry , i just ...
i need a second .
is something wrong ?
i just ... i got a sharp pain .
like labor ?
i don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s usually more cramp @-@ like .
ok , um , should we ... i think we should go to the hospital .
how ? she can &apos;t drive .
fine . i &apos;ll drive .
why do you get to drive ?
for one thing , i &apos;m a way better driver than you .
you had to take the test twice .
because it was too easy .
yeah , that &apos;s why people fail tests ,
because they &apos;re too easy .
and besides , you have a hurt ankle .
that &apos;s not my driving leg !
you know what ... ?
i think it passed .
i &apos;m fine . i ... yeah , i can drive .
let &apos;s , um ... let &apos;s get you home ...
i still think that we should go to the hospital .
sacred cross is only a few blocks from here .
yeah , ok .
so , i understand you &apos;ve been trying to get callie emancipated .
your honor , we just , we feel
like callie deserves a choice in this and ...
they &apos;re right .
they &apos;re right .
so , uh ...
i signed them .
look , i don &apos;t want you to get emancipated .
and i don &apos;t wanna be my father .
but i ... i believe what you said .
that i &apos;m your dad .
no matter what .
i am ...
... officially withdrawing my suit for custody .
are you ok ?
ooh , i think the baby &apos;s coming .
ok , ok , the hospital is just a couple blocks from here .
can you make it ?
we are gonna celebrate so big when i get home tonight !
maybe we should wait until i &apos;m officially adopted ?
i don &apos;t want to jinx anything .
nothing &apos;s gonna stop us now , callie .
just keep breathing , we &apos;re almost there . you can do this .
all right , i &apos;ll get home ... as soon as i can .
see you when i get home .
love you .
great . bye .
bye .
we got a two @-@ car accident on mission and e.
