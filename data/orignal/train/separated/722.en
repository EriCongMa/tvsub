I had Lyman Ellis steal what he could
off of Nolan's hard drive.
But before he could deliver it, he was found dead.
You're trusting the wrong people.
Nolan hasn't told you everything.
Nolan and I have no secrets.
People to whom you've placed your loyalty have two faces.
I want a family and a real marriage one day,
but with somebody stable,
not someone who...
Someone you pity.
I think, uh, I think it's time that we end this marriage.
I live between two worlds.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, but I want to. Don't shut me out.
The truth is that Malcolm Black was my attacker.
Daniel saved my life.
There is one secret, and it's cost the ones I love
more than I ever wanted.
I am David Clarke's daughter.
I am Amanda Clarke.
I took the identity of Emily Thorne
in order to clear my father's name.
Nolan lied to me.
I trusted him.
He could've told me about Emily, about Tony,
about how he really felt about me.
Oh, poppet.
Emily and Nolan are strangers to honesty.
There's so much more you don't know.
Then I want the truth.
All of it.
It has now been 12 hours
since Amanda Clarke's announcement
captured the country's attention.
As questions multiply, her camp has been clear...
There will be no further comment
from either Ms. Clarke or her father.
Now other players in this saga...
botably, socialite Victoria Grayson,
have also yet to comment.
So far, so good.
Radio silence from both Victoria and Margaux.
That doesn't mean it'll last.
Well, the longer they're quiet,
the longer your legend has time to grow online.
Exhibit "A..."
Twitter's debating what people are supposed to call you now.
#Amanda OR #Emily?
Emily Thorne no longer exists.
It's the end of an era.
My dad cut a deal with the Feds.
In exchange for not suing the government
over his 20-year ordeal,
they're not coming after me for fraud.
I wish the same could be said for all of our takedowns.
I've been tracking them,
and one's been particularly busy,
making calls to the rest of the red sharpie society.
Tom Kingsly.
The former senator?
Or as I like to call him,
the corrupt prosecutor
who convicted David, then rode a tide of public goodwill
into that seat in Congress.
Until we pulled it out from under him.
I came here tonight
to announce that I will not be seeking re-election this fall...
...as I am retiring from public life.
How did you do it?
How'd you get your hands on a sex tape?
I bought the building that his mistress lives in.
As part of the renovations, I had cameras installed.
And now?
I release the videos to the press.
Why? You already got what you wanted.
You destroyed a man's career.
I want to destroy his life.
If he had done the right thing,
he would've saved my father.
He chose not to, so...down he goes.
You scare me.
Good.
You never forget your first.
Kingsly's when we became a team. Remember?
Of course I do.
Look, if he's putting together a coalition,
we have to stop him before it reaches critical mass.
I figured one of them would try to get the ball rolling.
We just have to stay ahead of any surprises.
Whoops. Missed one.
It's been hours.
You're supposed to be the next Nolan Ross.
More like he's the old me.
But the guy still has major skills.
One wrong line of code, the files self-destruct.
Same happens if you try to download it,
which means this flash drive is your only copy.
I rigged a comprehensive decrypt that should do the trick.
But it'll take a couple hours.
Understand something. If you speak a word of this,
"self-destruct" will take on a whole new meaning for you.
Louise. How'd it go with your attorney?
Fine, I suppose.
When she got to the grounds for divorce,
I just... froze up.
I mean, I know Nolan lied,
but does that make him the devil?
You saw the press conference last night. You know.
That his friend Emily is really Amanda Clarke?
Maybe that explains why he had to lie.
I mean, the news is calling her
the modern-day Count of Monte Cristo.
Oh, how fitting, since they're both works of fiction.
You were kind enough to give me the thumb drive,
so I feel that you have
the right to know the whole truth.
Porter.
Why am I not surprised?
Emily.
You okay?
Yeah.
So you owe me 50 bucks.
Why is that?
Well, I bet my brother that you were gonna call to fill me in
before I dropped him at the airport.
Guess where I just came from.
I know you're pissed.
Yeah, and my friends -- they keep asking me,
"What kind of detective doesn't know the real name
of the woman that he's been dating?"
And, of course, once internal affairs starts asking
how I also helped her close a case
that she just admitted was a cover-up...
Look, I know this is messy.
Why don't you just say, "I'm sorry"?
Or just start there?
I thought that went without saying.
And with... with these circumstances...
That's what life is... a series of circumstances.
The fact that you didn't even consider mine says it all.
No, you're right, and I am sorry.
If I could do it over again...
It's too late.
That's why they call it live television.
Even you don't get a do-over.
So it was one big plan, right from the beginning?
Yes.
Emily Thorne arrived in the Hamptons
a fully formed monster with a single-minded purpose...
to systematically destroy me and attack my life
by tormenting my son and my daughter...
then, finally, my very sanity.
The second I laid eyes on you, I knew something was wrong.
And that's how I ended up in Claremont.
Don't struggle.
It'll only make things worse.
What are you doing?
You needed help.
I had no choice but to check you in.
Help me!
Someone help me, please!
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
Goodbye, Victoria.
My god, Victoria.
I had...no idea what she put you through.
But Nolan...
are you sure he was involved?
Louise, I know it's difficult for you to believe.
And I understand.
It's painful when we take the scales from our eyes.
But we all have to see.
"Wedding night"?
"Homeland security"?
everything she needed
to send my fiance to his grave.
Will you marry me?
Yes, Pascal. Yes.
That lying bastard.
I'm gonna hang him by his unmentionables.
No, Louise.
Continue with your civil divorce.
Why?
Because first,
I need to bring the tale of America's newest folk hero
to its proper end.
第四集 第十九集
Farewell, Rebecca.
We hardly knew you.
You didn't come home last night.
Just 'cause we're splittin' up doesn't mean you had to split.
I stayed in the city
so I could have the divorce papers drawn up.
Already?
Don't worry. You won't find any surprises.
Not like, "Turn on the TV to discover
"your husband's hiding some global mystery
about his best friend's identity from you" surprises.
I... I...
That threw me, too.
Oh, really?
So you didn't know she was Amanda Clarke?
No. No, I did.
I- I just...
I didn't know she was gonna announce it last night.
Louise.
Look, I'm so sorry I had to keep that information from you.
You know, that is a lot of syllables
when "I lied" would do.
But you know what? I get it.
No one's ever gonna be as close to you
as Emily... Amanda. Whatever.
But that has nothing to do with us.
Doesn't it, though?
You are a man of many secrets, Nolan.
Secret friends,
secret bonfire parties,
secret laptops you slam shut
every time I walk through the damn door.
Okay, I get it.
I get it. You're upset.
Lou, can we just sit down and talk?
There's nothing left to talk about.
This is on me.
I was so grateful to you when you rescued me
from the grip of my mama's talons, but...
you were never my true wonder twin.
Goodbye, Nolan.
That girl took our reputations and our careers,
but I promise you, Harmon,
we will make her pay.
Was that Uncle Bill?
Tell him I say hi.
How... how did you...
W-what are you...
Come on, Tom. Full sentences.
Emily.
Or do I say "Amanda"?
It's been a long time
since you lied your way into my campaign office.
And even longer
since you knowingly prosecuted an innocent man
and put him behind bars.
I tried the case I was given, and I got a conviction.
My hands are clean.
If that's true, then why are you sharing a wall with...
what is that, a nail salon next door?
You made a big mistake going public.
It took me five minutes to figure out
how you dismantled my life,
10 to realize that I'm not the only one.
So I made some calls.
To assemble your army of outraged cowards?
Let me guess... you started with
good, old-fashioned, wife-beating Judge Barnes.
The greater the power,
the greater the potential for abuse.
Then Wall Street crook Bill Harmon.
Emily Thorne.
As far as our investors are concerned,
it's just another sunshiny day.
It's leaked. All our investors are pulling out.
We're finished.
He betrayed my father's friendship
to help you on the stand.
And I bet you're having a difficult time locating Lydia Davis,
who you so expertly used to put the final nail in the coffin.
Taking the stand was Clarke's secretary Lydia Davis.
Whose testimony supported
The damning allegations made
by Clarke's former boss Conrad Grayson.
Conrad? What's wrong?
We need to get him in quick.
What does that mean?
My God. Is this your husband?
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
No, I don't. I...
Lydia. Hi.
Oh, don't tell me you've taken up
volunteering at the met as well.
Emily's renting my house for the summer.
We met briefly on the beach.
And then yesterday at the Southfork Inn.
I hope your husband's feeling better.
There's nothing honesty about you,
and I can finally prove it.
Here's the "After." Clearly not you.
Ready for the "Before"?
And there you are, Emily.
Looks just like you,
but with a billion fewer dollars.
There has been much speculation as to who shot me.
It was Lydia Davis.
And my husband and I are offering a $10 million reward
for her capture.
She thought she could take me down.
But she was wrong, just like you.
You think that scares me?
After what you've done?
You ruined lives.
You've taken our future.
Everyone that you went after had people who depended on them!
You stole 20 years of my life,
my daughter's childhood,
and you tried to end me.
You all had it coming
the moment you sold your souls to Conrad.
David, I-I...
If you or anybody else on that damn list
makes a move against Amanda...
look over your shoulder,
'cause I will end you.
You think you suffered at the hands of my daughter,
you have no idea what I'm capable of.
You hear me?
So get on the phone and spread the word...
stay away from David and Amanda Clarke.
Victoria's reaching out?
I won't answer.
That's called survival instinct.
You should follow it.
I'll handle Victoria.
I love you,
and there's nothing you can say
or tell me that you don't love me, too.
Because someday, I may need you to save me.
We can be better together.
Please, Daniel, come home.
I need you. We need you.
Margaux?
Victoria.
I assumed that you would have all hands on deck
trying to pierce the media myth your competitors
are building around Amanda Clarke.
We've got a problem.
Connie Bales at "Primetime" wants an exclusive.
This is not my priority.
Today, I'm focusing on a story
with far more import to you and me...
the clearing of Daniel's name.
I'll let others traffic in rumor and speculation
about Amanda Clarke.
Well, I'm not here about gossip and innuendo.
On the contrary, I just spent the entire morning
making sure that Conrad's conspirators
will not disrupt my case I'm building against her.
I have the evidence of Amanda's crimes,
And she's left quite a body count.
Amanda Clarke is not a killer.
Really?
She selected my son for sacrifice
long before he sacrificed himself.
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
God, I'm such an idiot.
I'm Daniel.
Emily.
How about I get you a dry Martini?
Twice the alcohol, half the stain potential.
Sure.
Why did you tell me I was gonna be a father?!
I'm sorry.
No!
What did you do?!
And let's not forget what she did to your father,
who died trying to protect us from threats that she made
posing as a Homeland Security agent,
which is a federal crime.
Ms. Thorne.
No. Agent Rebecca Stone, Homeland Security.
It enough to detain you indefinitely!
You'll wear this wire to the myclone launch,
Where I will watch your every move
until you get a confession from Conrad and Victoria.
Pascal...
Watch out!
When the government gets this evidence
and puts her behind bars, the story is yours.
Please, Victoria, let it go.
She caused you to lose your own child.
Why don't you care?
Because I lied.
Emily didn't push me.
But why did you tell me that she did?
Because I couldn't face you with the truth,
that it was my fault.
If I hadn't been consumed by this endless feud,
I would still be carrying my baby.
She started this feud.
She should have come after just me,
and instead, she targeted the innocent.
No, you're not hearing me.
Oh, but I am hearing you, Margaux.
Amanda Clarke is chaos theory,
and I cannot let this continue.
Victoria, it won't undo anything.
Except her.
Then I can't stand in your way,
but I won't help you, either.
Why call Tom Kingsly? What's her plan?
Whatever it was, we shut it down.
I doubt it.
She just left Margaux's office,
which means she's probably trying to mount some kind of offense.
She can't do much but sling mud.
I mean, what could Victoria possibly have to back up her claims?
Turns out she might have a lot.
When I got home last night after my all-night vigil here,
I started deleting files off my laptop.
You held on to files?
It's worse.
Louise came by and...
started accusing me of keeping secrets,
and when she looked at my laptop...
I just knew.
I ran a diagnostic.
Files were copied.
How did Victoria get them?
Cell G.P.S. put Louise and Victoria together last night
and again this morning.
What does she have?
Emily, I'm so sorry.
Emily only exists in the files that Victoria stole.
Now answer my question!
Six folders.
"Wedding night," "Claremont," "Homeland Security..."
Do you have any idea what you've exposed me to?!
Does part of you wanna get caught?
No? What? Of course not!
Then why hold on to anything?!
Amanda, ease off.
Because...
it meant something to me. Because I...
I wanted to remember what... what we had accomplished.
And what? You can't understand that?!
Understand this...
the last thing that you accomplished
is, quite possibly, to ruin all of it.
That's the "Primetime" studio.
Victoria's going to the press.
Not if I can help it.
Please let me try and fix this.
You've already fixed enough.
Whatever needs to be done, I'll do by myself.
I'm flattered you want to interview me, Ms. Bales.
Your story needs to be told properly, Victoria.
Wife to Conrad Grayson, lover to David Clarke,
mother-in-law to Amanda Clarke.
Who married your son, Daniel Grayson,
who we now know died a hero.
You've had quite an experience the last 20 years.
It has been a very difficult time.
All the more reason to allow my viewing public to support you.
I can't. First, there are measures
that may have to be taken by the authorities
when they learn the whole truth.
Or you can just hear it from me, Ms. Bales.
Amanda Clarke.
It's a pleasure.
I'm not usually a fan of the media.
And yet here you are.
As, it seems, are you.
Here's the deal...
I sit down with you for an exclusive interview,
Live, tonight, no questions off-limits...
on one condition...
you don't put Victoria Grayson on, ever.
It was open.
Yeah. Well...
Turns out security's not really my strong suit.
Yeah, David filled me in.
Don't beat yourself up, man.
No. No, I-I've got people in my life to do that for me.
Had.
Her interview's about to start. Are you not watching?
I think I've seen about enough of her for today.
She was pissed.
At the wrong person. Louise stole...
It was me.
It was me who kept the files.
What the hell's wrong with me? It's like...
it's like I've got a blind spot.
For Amanda Clarke.
It's possible you're not the only one.
It's like...
for four years, I thought that I was...
part of something bigger than myself. But...
if I had known the truth,
I would've just erased as I went.
And what's the truth?
That I'm just a hacker who provided the software
that ran Emily Thorne. Now that Emily's gone...
I'm obsolete.
Please tell me that is the bourbon talking.
Look, for better or worse, you guys were the dynamic duo.
You are the dynamic duo.
Amanda Clarke!
Who are you?
Nolan Ross. Friend of your father's.
It only took 10 years to return the favor.
I was kind of hoping you'd have to repay this one never.
Two years ago, I never would've thought I'd have...
a partner in all this,
or a real friend.
Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.
What do you have on tap?
A long summer of fun.
Trust me.
I do... with my life.
Amanda couldn't let you go if she wanted to.
Jack, if you had seen the way that she acted...
She was scared.
Doesn't happen often, but...
things are changing,
and soon, it's all gonna be out of her control.
We should go watch this thing now,
'cause you know how she gets when you save things for later.
Sometimes, a compelling opportunity presents itself.
This is such a time.
Tonight, we are honored to have Amanda Clarke.
Thank you for finding the time to squeeze me in.
Of course. The whole world is dying to hear your story...
save Victoria Grayson.
She didn't seem too thrilled to see you here.
Nothing's off-limits, right? Your words.
Now what I saw between you backstage
was nothing short of animosity.
She and I have had...
a disturbing relationship, dating back to my childhood.
How so?
It started before my father was arrested.
While Conrad Grayson made sure
that my father was convicted,
Victoria set her sights on his 9-year-old daughter.
The last person in the world who still believed in him.
She had me locked up,
brainwashed, and tortured...
until I stopped believing, too.
In return, you see to it that Amanda gets
the care she needs in a proper institution.
Please don't leave me in here.
I promise I'll be a good girl.
You'd just be pretending.
The past continues to define her present,
and she's given me no reason to believe
that it won't define her future as well.
So what made you see the light?
My father did,
from prison,
with words...
written to a daughter he thought he'd lost forever.
When she's ready...
I want you to make sure that she gets this.
Open the box.
My dear Amanda...
In the pages that follow,
I've attempted to piece together
the ruthless betrayal
that brought about my false imprisonment
and our unbearable separation.
I hope this chronicle will one day
provide you an understanding
of what I believe happened to me.
He saved me,
so I saved him...
The only way that I knew how...
by becoming Emily Thorne.
So from the time that you took on
a new name and a new identity,
You knew that you would have to deceive everyone.
Yes.
What did those lies do to the people who cared about you?
What was the cost?
The cost?
It's high.
People like the real Emily Thorne,
who died saving her family.
We're sisters, right?
Right.
Stay strong...Amanda.
You, too...Emily.
Emily, get down!
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
You've given me the one thing I thought I'd never have...
A real family.
My half-sister Charlotte,
driven into a downward spiral by all of us.
Leave peacefully,
and lay off the drugs, or I will arrest you.
I don't wanna think anything.
I don't even wanna feel anything.
'cause you are gonna keep
your stupid and thankless mouth shut!
And if you even think about crossing me,
I will erase you as I have so many others.
Aiden Mathis.
The one person who really understood what I was doing.
You need to stay focused,
get the evidence.
You're gonna need this later.
You're not alone in this.
You never will be.
When they pay for what they did to your father,
then what?
I can be with you.
Just go and make sure everything's ready for when this is done.
Come back when the dust settles.
Well, at least I get to say goodbye this time.
The man that I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.
Being with you is the only time I've ever felt peace.
You're everything to me.
Amanda Clarke...
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Taken from me... forever.
Aiden?
Aiden, are you okay?
Aiden, wake up.
Aiden, wake up!
No! No! No! No!
No!
I'm sorry.
Now I have to ask,
did you ever have to harm anyone physically
in order to protect your identity?
Yes.
Did it ever go beyond that?
I would never cross that line.
Sounds like you think you know someone who has.
Victoria?
Emily ripped away my chance for true love.
It's only fair that I do the same for her.
Goodbye, Mr. Mathis.
That's a strong accusation, Ms. Clarke.
I didn't make an accusation.
It's on Victoria to take responsibility for her own actions.
I do have sympathy for her, though.
She was born with a dark soul.
We know that she was...
convicted of killing a man at 15.
She only grew more toxic ever since.
This is why I waited to reveal myself.
I knew what she was capable of
if she learned the truth.
Even when she thought I was Emily Thorne,
Victoria schemed,
plotted, and railed against me, my friends, and loved ones.
Do you think it's all over now?
I pray that it is.
But deep down inside, I know it's not.
Victoria, if you're watching,
it is in your hands to end this.
I can't imagine how she feels
finally getting to say everything out loud.
And she's not revenging anymore. She's just...
Our Amanda now.
Yeah, you're right.
Wait.
Jack, are you going to her?
No. No, I'm... I'm meeting someone for drinks.
Why aren't you going to her?
We're not doing this.
But this is your moment.
This is the girl you met on the beach.
This is the girl that you named your boat after.
The "Amanda"?
Yeah.
Sammy named her.
Sammy! Sammy! Get down!
What's the matter with you?
Sorry. He's not normally this friendly.
Kind of an old grump, actually.
I'm Jack.
I'm Amanda.
I'll come back for you.
I promise.
It's nice to see you again.
Sammy.
He's home.
He was a really good friend.
You two belong together.
And deep down,
she knows it.
Does she?
You get a boat out on the open water,
then you catch a wind, and the sails fill.
And she comes to life under you,
and it feels like more than just wind
and water and vessel.
It feels like there's something else going on,
something pulling you forward and...
and surrounding you at the same time.
Am I making any sense?
You're making perfect sense.
It's just, you're saying it to the wrong girl, Jack.
I feel like this feeling...
comes along once or twice in a lifetime, if we're lucky.
Tell me I'm alone in this.
Tell me I'm alone in this,
and I won't bother you again.
I'm so sorry, Jack.
Look, thank you for the pep talk.
Good night, Nolan.
Victoria?
Victoria?
I tried to call you.
I turned the phones off.
I couldn't listen to them ring anymore.
What Emily said...
it was cruel to go on the air and spout such vitriol,
to say nothing of the outright lies.
I know you never killed a man when you were young.
I never felt comfortable bringing it up,
but Daniel told me what your mother did to you.
Take the gun. Aim for his chest.
No, I can't.
We'll tell the police that he attacked us,
that you shot him to protect me.
I'm so sorry.
They all picked away at your dignity
and your happiness.
Your mother...
I should've listened to your deadbeat father,
gotten rid of you before you were even born.
Conrad...
It's time you know the truth.
David Clarke isn't just amanda's father.
He's your biological father as well.
No. He's not.
Mom...
Charlotte.
I will never forgive you for this.
And I'll never forgive you
for inviting that bastard into our bed.
And, Emily, I know what a woman in love looks like,
and that's not you.
I understand why you're on edge, Victoria.
Especially here, tonight.
I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you
to spend time in David Clarke's old house.
The memories of love and betrayal that must flood in...
I'll give you a moment,
since you so clearly need one.
Do not let them win.
You have the evidence. Call the authorities.
Believe me, Margaux,
I've tried to make things right so many times.
I went to the government to put Conrad away for life
and to clear David's name, and she knew it.
I want full immunity
in exchange for the information I'm about to give you.
I can't guarantee anything
till I know what we're talking about.
But now she's won in the court of public opinion.
Amanda Clarke has dug a grave for me tonight.
But I won't let her put you in it.
Victoria, let me help you,
Just like you helped me in my times of need.
You can't resurrect
a woman dead to the world.
You know how much I love you, Amanda?
Infinity?
Well, infinity...
times...
infinity.
Daddy, what are you doing?
When this is done, it's gonna be a reminder
that no mistake is ever gonna break us apart.
I could not be more proud of you, sweetheart.
Tonight, the world got to know you the way I do.
I hope so.
I haven't seen this since I made it for you.
It's a little worse for wear.
Aren't we all?
"My dear amanda, if you are reading this,
then two things have come to pass."
"I am finally able to provide you
the life you were unjustly denied."
"And sadly, I'm not gonna be able to share that life with you."
Well, you were half right.
It all started so wonderfully.
You and I on the beach,
Sammy, Jack.
We really get to spend the whole summer here?
And every summer after that.
What's his name?
Happy birthday.
Uh, that is up to you. What's he look like?
Like a Sammy.
Sammy!
Are you licking daddy?
You know what I love about you most?
Is the way you love
absolutely everything and absolutely everyone.
You promise me that you're never gonna lose that.
I've spent my whole life chasing that happiness...
and it was all taken away in an instant.
After what I did tonight...
It's all gonna change again.
You let the whole world in.
Emily Thorne would never have done that.
She was prepared for anything.
For the first time...
I have no idea what's coming next.
艾米莉·索恩曝光自己就是大卫·克拉克的女儿
