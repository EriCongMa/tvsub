morning .
floater .
manhole .
what are you doing ?
well , i &apos;ve been thinking about
how you &apos;re leaving for the fbi academy ,
and i &apos;m going to paris .
teeth .
statues .
this is your idea of a trip down memory lane ?
i realize that most of our shared experiences
aren &apos;t documented .
you mean other than with extensive departmental paperwork
and court transcripts ?
which are cold and impersonal ,
so i have decided to make a virtual memory book .
with crime scene photos ?
yes .
i mean , how many fascinating crime scenes have we shared ?
community theater .
sex party .
revolutionary war reenactment .
high school reunion .
refrigerator .
body farm .
church . fishing tournament .
i &apos;m going to miss you .
well , i &apos;m not gone yet .
no , but almost .
how many more of these experiences are we gonna have ?
well , unless this is my mother
demanding more cheese curls for korsak &apos;s retirement party ,
i &apos;d say at least one more .
rizzoli .
isles .
remember that guy ?
doesn &apos;t seem so sexy when it ends up like that , huh ?
robert riley , 35 years old .
apparently married .
is she here ?
no .
and it looks like a suitcase is missing from the closet .
her underwear drawer is empty .
if i &apos;m running for my life ,
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;d take the time .
but if i &apos;m packing to leave after i kill my husband ...
well , clean underwear would be
at the top of my on @-@ the @-@ lam list .
life on the lam would be a little rough
at the four seasons , ma barker .
cute . but you &apos;d never find me .
i &apos;d be at the ritz .
anyway , it appears as though our victim has been decapitated .
no disrespect , doc ,
but that head is still on that neck .
an orthopedic decapitation ,
an atlanto @-@ occipital dislocation .
well , what do you know ?
can that happen in some weird sex game ?
can &apos;t say .
maura , just one little guess .
a small surmise .
it appears as though he received a high @-@ energy strike
from a very large , blunt object --
something flexible and without rough edges .
did you find any balloon animals ?
not even a balloon .
all right , i will check with frankie ,
have him search the neighborhood ,
see if anybody saw a rogue blimp on the loose .
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
and miss all this fun ?
aw , gee , maura .
it had to be panda .
nothing like this ever happens around here .
if it did , i would know .
did robert and his wife ever --
uh , elaine -- that &apos;s her name .
and did robert and elaine ever fight ?
oh , i wouldn &apos;t know what goes on behind closed doors .
did you ever hear them arguing ?
no . no , not at all .
i do know that robert would ,
uh , leave every morning at 8 : 00,
i assume to work .
he came back at about noon , stayed for an hour ,
and then , uh , left again until 5 : 00 .
i &apos;m sorry , detective . my mom means to be helpful .
oh , she is . and your name is ... ?
steve . steve browning .
did you know the rileys ?
not really .
uh , is this connected to the break @-@ ins ?
break @-@ ins ?
mom , didn &apos;t you say something about a black truck ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
i saw it several times , driving back and forth .
very suspicious .
very .
hey , ma .
hey , janey .
okay , i better not be here because i can reach high places .
no , no , no . i have something for you .
i mean , i didn &apos;t mean for you to rush on over .
well , your text said it was important .
it &apos;s important . it &apos;s just not urgent .
it reminded me of you .
yeah , uh ...
yeah , no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s totally me .
yeah , well , i figured where you &apos;re going ,
you would need an extra suitcase .
ma , i &apos;m going to the fbi . i &apos;m not going on safari .
yeah , but you could have school supplies and books
and manuals and stuff .
who carries manuals in a suitcase ?
i just want you to think about me when you &apos;re gone .
ok @-@ okay , okay , okay . thank you .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
and , you know , come on .
you know , of course i would think about you .
but not because of this . this is hideous .
i &apos;m going back to work .
i started the search of marriage records in boston .
according to this ,
robert riley and elaine chan were married six months ago .
what ?
nothing .
nope .
what ?
you can &apos;t kiss me at the office .
i know that .
you know , we do have to tell everyone
that we &apos;re engaged .
what are you doing ?
i wasn &apos;t spying .
it looks like you were spying .
yes , i know .
it &apos;s just no one will agree to do
these testimonials for the party , and i &apos;ve --
i &apos;ve resorted to sneaking up on people .
you need to erase that .
oh , yeah . i will .
i do not want to be the spiller of beans .
i &apos;ll record mine . come back in one hour .
oh , thank you , nina .
and let me just be the first to say
thank you ?
that &apos;s beautiful . what &apos;s it mean ?
it means , &quot; may you not see a pig
on the way to your wedding . &quot;
you guys rock .
one hour .
yeah . one hour .
oh , hey , jane .
no .
all right . i &apos;ll catch you later then .
unless that &apos;s bass ,
you got a suitcase from ma .
she told me it was meant to complement my personality .
mine is covered in leopard spots .
oh , the leopard is incredibly intelligent
and astoundingly strong .
they are elusive , secretive , and beautiful .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re a turtle .
tortoise .
they &apos;re known for their serenity and steadfastness ,
and they &apos;ve become a symbol of wisdom .
i underestimated ma . i just thought they were ugly .
what do we got here ?
well , not only is there
an atlanto @-@ occipital dislocation ,
but there &apos;s significant damage to c @-@ 3 and c @-@ 4 .
which would take a tremendous force .
and an object at least 10 inches wide .
so it seems unlikely that this happened
while he was handcuffed to the bed .
so someone placed him on the bed
to make it look like a sex game gone wrong .
what &apos;s he weigh ? about 250 ?
close .
117.196 kilograms .
258 pounds , 6 ounces .
thank you .
there &apos;s something else .
subcutaneous hemorrhaging to the right thenar muscle .
so he hit something or someone .
all right . thanks .
think you ever would &apos;ve run out of
crazy medical terms to say to me ?
would you let the door hit you in the face as you entered ?
of course not .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
okay .
cue , nina .
i came here from chicago and didn &apos;t know anyone .
i didn &apos;t really want to know anyone .
but you were kind , patient , funny .
i was so worried about being the newcomer ,
and from the first moment ,
you all treated me like you &apos;ve known me forever .
and i hope we &apos;ll be a part of each other &apos;s lives forever .
because that &apos;s a lot better than saying goodbye .
that &apos;s beautiful .
all right . thanks .
yep . okay .
you gotta do that today ?
you got like a month left .
oh , i &apos;ve got 15 unused sick days
and two weeks vacation .
really ?
yeah . you probably have much more . have you checked ?
no .
what ? you assume you &apos;re gonna die with it all unused ?
yes , sitting right here at this desk ,
surrounded by 42 empty cups of coffee .
pretty picture .
so you &apos;re done today ? !
today .
this what you had in mind ?
oh , perfect . thanks .
i hate this !
and something for you .
robert riley was a plumber .
had his own small , one @-@ man operation .
and no criminal record ,
no restraining order , no lawsuits .
money problems ?
his credit report is clean ,
and his business is solvent .
any trace of the wife ?
got no hit on the bolo , checked the airlines
and ran the name elaine chan through ice -- nothing .
she has no credit cards , bank accounts ,
and no driver &apos;s license .
it &apos;s like she didn &apos;t exist ,
except for being married to robert .
well , we know she exists . the neighbors saw her .
well , i &apos;ll keep digging .
okay , thanks .
i &apos;m gonna take a load of this stuff down to my car .
i &apos;ll give you a hand .
hi , babe .
what are you doing here ?
well , i knew you were doing all this yourself ,
so i , uh , took the day off to help .
best boyfriend ever !
so , jane and maura
still don &apos;t know this party &apos;s for them , too ?
nope .
they &apos;re completely in the dark .
you know , you never really , uh ,
told me how you feel about everyone leaving .
i don &apos;t know .
sometimes it helps to talk about things .
did i ever tell you
that i used to force jane to come to sunday dinner ?
i insisted , no matter how busy she was .
but after a while ,
she and frankie used to come every sunday ,
hungry for lasagna .
and then maura joined ,
and sometimes korsak and kiki ,
and now nina .
it &apos;s my gang . it &apos;s my normal .
i , uh ...
i just don &apos;t know
if my lasagna will taste the same
without everybody at the table .
what are you doing ?
what ?
kent told me that you weren &apos;t cooperating
with the video .
i was totally cooperating .
too late . it &apos;s already gone .
oh , you are the worst boyfriend ever .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
and that was lovely .
and i really did come to help , so tell me what i can do .
oh , i do have one thing you can help me with .
this way .
you rang ?
yes .
did you find elaine chan ?
not yet ,
but i did locate robert &apos;s mother in florida .
she only met elaine on skype .
okay .
is this on ?
oh , god !
hi , angela .
hi . i did it !
we &apos;re teaching her how to skype .
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
hi , jane .
hey , ron .
look . you two look so cute .
what happened ? i can &apos;t see her anymore .
i &apos;m here .
this is fun !
i mean , i &apos;m gonna be able to talk to you every day ,
and see you every day .
and you know what ? i could watch you teach .
yeah , that is great .
i &apos;m sure the recruits will love that .
you know what ? hey , let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s practice something else .
you see the -- the top row of keys there ?
yeah .
okay , find f10 .
honey , they all say f @-@ something .
okay . oh , i found it .
okay . go ahead and press that .
we will talk about this later .
sorry .
so good .
oh , hey . what &apos;s up ?
you working for a moving company now ?
got a contact in the mailroom .
oh , yeah ? did she teach you how to skype yet ?
your mother &apos;s gonna show me .
look what we found .
elaine chan looks to be married
to at least two other men in massachusetts .
elaine &apos;s a bigamist ?
or elaine chan &apos;s a phony name .
also , about a month before they were married ,
robert paid $ 5,000 to second pleasure enterprises .
they &apos;re not a registered corporation
with the secretary of state &apos;s office ,
but they do have a small web presence .
so , robert dies handcuffed to his bed in his red satin boxers ,
and now we find out he gave 5 grand to this place ?
second pleasure could be a cover for sex @-@ trafficking .
i &apos;m gonna look into these other marriages .
and i &apos;ll call you once i find an address for second pleasure .
okay .
and i will give you $ 1,000 if you will stop packing .
i am lying , but it &apos;s worth it to see you in the chair again .
why can &apos;t i find the cotton swabs and the sterile water ?
well , that &apos;s not where they go .
yeah , sorry , i made a few changes .
well , why would you make any changes ?
for my own ease ?
but rearranging things before you went on vacation
was insensitive .
i &apos;m sorry , maura .
n @-@ no . no , i &apos;m the one that should be sorry .
i &apos;m just --
i just can &apos;t get used to the idea
that i &apos;m taking a leave of absence ,
even for a little while .
well , do you know what ?
i look forward to reading the book
that you &apos;ll write in this brief respite .
ready to do your video now ?
no .
you &apos;re very grumpy . did you know that ?
still , no .
you got anything for me ?
maybe .
we found linseed oil and beeswax on the victim &apos;s neck .
also , i &apos;m doing additional tests
to determine the origins of both substances .
we found two dna profiles inside the house --
one from our victim , the other from a female .
did you get a match in codis ?
no , but when you find the wife ,
we &apos;ll be able to tell if she put the cuffs on her husband .
oh , great .
what is it ?
oh , our only lead is a strip club in chinatown .
nobody talks in strip clubs .
so that means you &apos;re gonna
have to go undercover as a stripper ?
we &apos;ve done worse .
i &apos;ll get my tassels .
hey . sorry to keep you waiting .
i didn &apos;t actually think you &apos;d show up ,
so i didn &apos;t leave the bpd
until you texted that you were actually here .
do you get punched a lot ?
not as much as you &apos;d think .
okay .
i &apos;m ready when you are .
i hate endings .
the truth is i hate beginnings , too .
i like middles , the steady sameness ,
comfortable forever .
but i guess i &apos;ve been doing this long enough to know
you don &apos;t always get to pick when life changes .
so ...
i know i have no choice but to embrace this ,
and i &apos;m gonna make it the best version of a next step that i can .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
all of you .
the bar is always open .
korsak .
hard candy shell , soft nougat center .
oh , for god &apos;s sake !
it &apos;s not your grandfather &apos;s strip club ,
but it &apos;s still creepy .
that it is .
good afternoon , sir . my name is josh walker .
i am the proprietor .
regretfully , you cannot have your own lady friend in the club .
nobody &apos;s lady friend . boston homicide .
oh , yes , detective , please . please , come on in .
may i offer you something to drink ,
or , uh , uh , a booth perhaps ?
we don &apos;t want any drinks , we don &apos;t want a booth .
we just want some answers .
what do you have going on here , josh ?
this is a social club ,
a place for middle @-@ aged men ,
to meet women without the stress of traditional dating .
this is a legitimate business , detective .
i &apos;m a very successful matchmaker .
really ?
&apos;cause to me , it looks like you &apos;re a pimp .
i swear , officers , that -- that &apos;s all i do .
i -- i introduce decent men
to recently @-@ arrived to this country ,
but equally decent women .
5 grand for an introduction seems a little steep .
that -- that &apos;s a membership fee .
he a member ?
robert , yes , yes . just got married .
very happy .
well , he was until somebody broke his neck
and killed him .
oh , my . who would do that ?
maybe you .
me ? n @-@ no , no , no .
i haven &apos;t even talked to him since this engagement .
besides , that man could eat me for breakfast .
okay , let &apos;s say we buy that .
elaine is missing .
do you have any idea why or where she might be ?
you know , i always say ,
&quot; love is so hard to facilitate . &quot;
which means these women
don &apos;t have valid immigration status ?
n @-@ n @-@ no , they do . ev @-@ every woman here is fine .
they &apos;re fine .
we can take you downtown
and put a big sign on the door that says , &quot; closed . &quot;
her -- her real name isn &apos;t elaine . it &apos;s wei .
i @-@ i put robert and wei in touch with the real elaine .
wei have a last name ?
wei chan .
well , maybe she has a file .
maybe elaine has a file .
maybe you get up and go get them .
okay .
you think wei ran because she killed robert ?
even if somebody else killed him ,
maybe she ran &apos; cause she didn &apos;t want to get shipped home .
love only goes so far .
39c , press this button ...
kent .
okay , i only have a few minutes .
uh , all right . um , i &apos;m just about ready .
hey , did you get rid of the stuff with me and nina ?
no , i -- i haven &apos;t done it yet , but i promise i will .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;ve got some -- some great footage
just before your , uh , your big reveal . yeah ?
well , i &apos;m worried that if i erase your stuff ,
i &apos;m going to erase that , too .
okay .
oh , hey . look , it &apos;s ready -- the camera .
all right .
hey , let me just get a little bit of focus here .
okay , uh ...
i know this isn &apos;t goodbye .
i mean , we &apos;re family , all of us .
and sure , i &apos;m gonna miss
seeing you guys every day ,
but mainly ...
i &apos;m filled with a sense of gratitude .
you &apos;ve helped me to be a better man and a better cop .
i &apos;m gonna hold down the fort here .
and i think --
no , i -- i know
that i &apos;m gonna make you proud .
yes , she &apos;s my niece .
you know where she is ?
she returned to china .
really ? when ?
last night .
you know why ?
she would be sent home anyway .
this seemed easier .
did she kill him ?
yes . but it was an accident .
we &apos;re gonna need the whole story .
robert was a good husband at first .
but i think he began to believe
that wei was using him for paper .
you can &apos;t get papers
if you get married using someone else &apos;s name .
yes , but robert stopped caring about the truth of this .
he just wanted to control her .
he wouldn &apos;t let her talk to anyone or visit me anymore .
he locked her in the house . he beat her .
do you have proof of that ?
she went to the hospital twice .
she had to lie about why .
how do you know she &apos;s gone ?
i gave her the money for an airplane ticket .
do you know you could be arrested
for helping a killer evade justice ?
she -- she was just defending herself .
we &apos;re gonna need you to stay put .
we &apos;re gonna put you on a no @-@ fly list
until we &apos;re done with our investigation .
she &apos;s lying .
yeah , but about which part ?
the leaving ? the killing ?
the leaving . frankie !
hey ! out of the way !
get out of the car !
show us your hands !
out of the car .
out of the car !
face the glass .
the chasing -- not gonna miss so much .
has jane done her video yet ?
no .
well , maybe i &apos;ll wait for her
and just see what kind of a tone she strikes .
i &apos;m guessing aggressive and sarcastic .
probably not your style .
i just don &apos;t know what to say .
if it was me , i &apos;d be like , &quot; hey , mom . i miss you .
russell , good luck with the baby .
scotland , the brave . &quot;
but that makes no sense in this context .
but it &apos;s what &apos;s in my heart .
and you should say what &apos;s in yours .
okay .
when i started this job ,
i thought it would be gratifying
to help victims of homicide through my forensic work ,
which it has been ,
and also , so much more .
this adventure has made me more alive .
and you have been the big family i never had .
and you &apos;ve brought so much joy and laughter into my life .
and for this , i will be forever grateful .
and maybe , just this once , on the record ,
i am willing to speculate this --
i &apos;ll love you , and i &apos;ll never forget you .
how was that ?
good .
i &apos;m really sad .
mrs. riley , let &apos;s go over this one more time .
tell me what happened .
i &apos;m so sorry .
so sorry .
i understand . i understand , but i just --
what did the wife say ?
same thing as her aunt .
so the handcuffs weren &apos;t for sex ?
he was holding her prisoner ?
seems that way .
that &apos;s a very tidy desk , sergeant .
i hate it .
but you &apos;re leaving , too .
yeah , but look at my desk .
i &apos;m so sick of goodbyes .
will you please distract me with science ?
the linseed oil and the beeswax on the back of robert &apos;s neck
are from car wax ,
the same kind that was on robert &apos;s car .
car bumpers are flexible .
newer ones are , yeah .
could he have been hit by a car ?
there were no abrasions or bruising
to indicate that a car hit him .
what if he hit the car ?
you know , like , if he was pushed and he fell ,
would his own weight decapitate him
when his head hit the bumper ?
that is possible .
how much does wei chan weigh ?
110 , soaking wet .
this guy weighs , what , 258 and 6 ounces .
well , she &apos;s not strong enough to kill him , much less move him .
then why say she did ?
to protect somebody else .
she &apos;s not changing her story .
she will .
now a good time ?
sure .
you sure ?
yeah .
congratulations , frankie .
frank .
thank you , maura .
now what ?
well , now we try and figure out who wei is protecting .
okay . i &apos;ll get right on it .
thank you .
sweetheart ?
is it possible you checked &quot; bachelorette party &quot; on the form
instead of &quot; bon @-@ voyage party &quot; ?
what ? what do you mean ?
oh , shit !
i didn &apos;t order this .
i didn &apos;t order that .
no ?
no , but i can fix it .
i just need some cream of tartar ,
food coloring , and powdered sugar .
stat .
yep .
in the kitchen .
okay .
right here , please .
dr. drake , was robert dead before or after he was moved to the bed ?
well , based on lividity ,
it was clear he was moved afterwards .
thank you .
yeah , you &apos;re welcome .
you told detective rizzoli
that you were alone in the house when you killed robert .
yes .
go ahead and pick up that dummy
and move it , uh , there .
we both know you can &apos;t do that , huh ?
i know that robert was beating you .
we went to some of your local hospitals .
we found some nurses who remembered you being brought in
with someone who looked like ... him .
okay .
this is how this is gonna go .
we &apos;re gonna leave and let you two talk .
you can stick to your stories
and know that we will figure out what happened ,
and then justice will take its course .
or you can tell us the truth .
if robert was beating you ,
and you didn &apos;t intentionally kill him ,
the choice seems pretty clear .
think they &apos;ll confess ?
they will if they know what &apos;s good for &apos; em .
you solved a murder on your last day on the job .
not bad .
how come i don &apos;t feel better about it ?
this , uh ...
this should stay here .
janey ...
why don &apos;t you take him ?
no , no , no .
he , uh ...
he should stay here ... with you .
you know , he &apos;d probably be your partner by now , so ...
he should be --
he should be here to look after you .
hi .
hey .
wei chan admitted
that her husband had been beating her for months .
well , the reports and x @-@ rays you gave me from the hospitals
are consistent with abuse .
um , steve was the neighbor across the street ,
helped her start getting treatment ,
they fell in love , decided to run away together .
robert came home early and caught them packing the car .
when he went after steve ,
he slipped and hit his neck on the bumper .
well ...
... it &apos;s my last case .
nobody goes to jail , two people go to china ,
unless ...
please ! please , please , please .
i would really love one more call before my shift is over .
you don &apos;t want it to end ?
no , i don &apos;t want to go to this party ma &apos;s throwing for us .
you know , she thought she did such a good job hiding it .
she did .
but i just know her well enough to know
that she can &apos;t resist giving us a big sendoff .
well , that &apos;s it .
my shift is officially over .
so it &apos;s really coming to an end . yeah .
we had some good times , though .
hey . oh , look at that !
no . do you find it so hard to imagine yourself living here .
hey . i &apos;m sorry .
lemon water , please .
maura , stop it ,
or they &apos;re going to charge us for the robes again .
do i look bad @-@ ass ?
yeah , you look like a bad @-@ ass . okay .
but i have a new apartment !
it &apos;s a turbo .
yeah , it is .
no !
no crying ! come on .
our locations are changing . that &apos;s it .
i know .
i &apos;m gonna go get dressed for this party .
i &apos;ll see you there , okay ?
be right behind you .
all right .
see you at the party .
you &apos;re not getting off that easily .
there &apos;s no need .
yeah , you &apos;re totally right .
it &apos;s just a distinguished 32 @-@ year career .
by all means , let &apos;s let it end with no comment .
you &apos;re gonna make me cry .
welcome to the club .
victor @-@ nine @-@ eight @-@ one . ocean @-@ frank .
thank you for your service , sergeant korsak .
job well done .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you .
oh , good . i have something to show you .
hi . i &apos;m jane .
what are you doing ?
on this ipad , i have made a video for tonight &apos;s party .
i &apos;ve left 40 seconds for you .
if you do not wish to make a video ,
then i &apos;m going to fill those 40 seconds with &quot; sock jane . &quot;
i &apos;m so upset about the changes in my life
that instead of making a video -- -fine , i &apos;ll do it .
i am not going to miss you .
i use anger to hide my emotions .
i love you , kent .
stop it . stop it .
i &apos;ve been with this group for a short time ,
and i am still struck
by how wonderful all of you are .
i &apos;m just so glad that i married into this family .
i love you .
i love you , too .
you know we do have to tell everyone we &apos;re engaged .
excuse me . sorry . aah !
what ?
what ? !
surprise .
group hug . yes .
oh , group hug ! group hug ! yes !
i don &apos;t want to make a video .
everybody . be quiet . come on . be quiet .
i don &apos;t wanna talk about how i &apos;m gonna miss everyone .
i would like to pretend
that this long , beautiful dream is gonna go on forever ,
but nothing goes on forever .
we &apos;ve been through so much --
good things , horrible things .
i can &apos;t imagine what life is gonna be like tomorrow ,
next week , next year .
just say it .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna miss you --
really , really miss you .
come on .
and i love you .
to have been here with all of you ...
i think i might be the luckiest person in the whole world .
now , can i have a beer and some penis cake ?
power adapter , check .
american dollars , check .
euros , check .
maura , they have money , and atms .
well , what if there &apos;s a power outage ?
well , then , the power adapter isn &apos;t gonna do you any good .
i set two alarms for tomorrow morning .
you don &apos;t need to .
my flight is at 8 : 00 , and i need to be at the airport .
i told you i was gonna pick you up .
no , we &apos;ve talked about this .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s too emotional
for me to say goodbye to you at the airport .
i know .
what &apos;s that ?
you used your miles and bought me a ticket to paris .
thank you !
you &apos;re coming to paris ?
yes !
i checked with personnel .
i have eight weeks vacation , four weeks sick time ,
and bpd only buys out eight weeks , so ...
well , what about the fbi ?
i called them , and i asked if i could show up later ,
and they said &quot; mais oui . &quot;
you speak french ?
i know how to say , &quot; mais oui . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe it !
we are going to have a full month in france together .
i know !
we &apos;re gonna have so much fun !
i know !
you have to go home and pack .
no , my leopard bag is ready .
one bag ?
well , yeah . what ?
jeans , sweatpants , t @-@ shirts , toothbrush .
okay , you can &apos;t walk around the &quot; city of lights &quot;
in sweatpants and a t @-@ shirt .
watch me .
i &apos;ll have to rework the itinerary .
what ? what ?
we &apos;re gonna drink a bunch of wine ,
eat some smelly cheese ... mmm .
... i &apos;ll follow you around ,
and we look at old french things .
old french things ?
and then drink more wine ,
and the book &apos;ll write itself .
i &apos;m not worried about it .
this is not how i pictured the next chapter starting .
well , maybe that &apos;s the beauty of it .
i know !
you should just wear that the whole time .
i can &apos;t breathe .
do you have any sweatpants ?
you &apos;re going first @-@ class ?
nope
aren &apos;t you ?
