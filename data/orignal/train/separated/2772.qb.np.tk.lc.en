we &apos;re looking out for you . we want you to be happy .
i may only have a couple beers in me , but i love you .
i &apos;m still on my first .
i just think you &apos;re nice .
that &apos;s when we started this fruit basket business .
we call ourselves &quot; the three basketeers . &quot;
like &quot; the three musketeers , &quot; only with fruit .
how do you want your burgers ?
presents first !
we &apos;re doing presents first .
hey , hold on there , tiger . how are you holding up ?

this one right here is from me .
okay . it &apos;s light . it rattles .
it &apos;s ...
... travel scrabble !
thank you .
this one &apos;s from joey .
it feels like a book , i think it &apos;s a book . and it &apos;s a book !
it &apos;s dr. seuss !
that book got me through some tough times .
there &apos;s a little child inside this man .
the doctors say if they remove it , he &apos;ll die .
who &apos;s this from ?
from ross .
oh , my god ! he remembered !
remembered what ?
lt was months ago .
we walked by this antique store . i saw this pin .
i told him it was like one my grandma had when i was little .
i can &apos;t believe he remembered !
well , sure , but can you play it on a plane ?
it &apos;s so pretty ! this must &apos;ve cost him a fortune .
i can &apos;t believe it .
remember when he fell in love with carol ...
... and bought her that expensive crystal duck ?
what did you just say ?
crystal duck .
no , no , no . the &quot; love &quot; part ?
oh , my god !
oh , no , no , no .
that &apos;s good . just keep rubbing your head . that &apos;ll turn back time .
this is unbelievable . i mean , this is unbelievable !
i know . this is really , really huge .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s small . it &apos;s tiny . it &apos;s petite . it &apos;s wee .
i don &apos;t think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again .
is there a mute button on this woman ?
i think this is so great . i mean , you and ross !
did you have any idea ?
no , none !
my first night in the city , he mentioned asking me out ...
... but nothing ever happened .
what else did he say ? does he wanna go out ?
given that he &apos;s in love with you ...
... he wouldn &apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee .
ross ? all this time ? i &apos;ve gotta talk to him .
he &apos;s in china !
the country .
is his flight gone ?
yes ! he &apos;s watching a woman do this :
he &apos;s gone !
his flight doesn &apos;t leave for 45 minutes .
what about time difference ? -from here to the airport ?
you &apos;ll never make it !
i &apos;ve gotta try .
what &apos;ll you say to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
then you shouldn &apos;t go .
right . if you &apos;re gonna break his heart , that can wait .
but if it &apos;s good , tell him now .
maybe i &apos;ll know when i see him .
all right , does this help ?
no . look , all i know is , i cannot wait a week . this is just too big .
i &apos;ve just gotta talk to him . okay , i &apos;ll see you later .
rachel , i love you ! deal with me first !
all right .
ross ! excuse me , pardon me .

i need to talk to my friend .
sorry , you &apos;re not allowed here without a pass .
he &apos;s right there , in the blue jacket ! can l ?
i &apos;m sorry . federal regulations !
then could you please just give him a message for me ?
this is very important .

rachel loved the present . she &apos;ll see you when you get back .

me , again ?
sure . why not ?
boy , somebody &apos;s gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow !
i gotta tell you , you are nothing like i thought you &apos;d be .
how do you mean ?
i had you pegged as a guy who &apos;s always , &quot; me , me , me ! &quot;
but you , you &apos;re a giver .
you &apos;re the most generous man i ever met .
i mean , you &apos;re practically a woman .
you &apos;re just saying that .
no .
a woman !
so ?
i missed him .
i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s too bad .
yeah , right .
no , i feel bad for her . i do .
i can think of somebody other than myself .
all right , i &apos;m going to bed .
happy birthday . hang in there .
thanks .
yes !
pizza coupons .
okay . you guys want help cleaning up this mess ?
that &apos;d be great .
so , rach , you wanna save this wrapping paper ?
are you gonna go for it with ross or should i throw it out ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
thought about it all the way there ...
... and i thought about it all the way back . you know , it &apos;s ross !
you know what i mean ? it &apos;s ross .
sure !
sure .
i don &apos;t know . this is just my initial gut feeling ...
... but i &apos;m thinking it &apos;d be really great .
oh , my god , me too ! we &apos;d be like friends @-@ in @-@ law !
the best part is you already know all about him .
you start on the 1.5th date .
but it would be like starting on the 1.5th date .
another good point .
i mean , on the 1.5th date , you &apos;re already in a very ...
... &quot; relationship @-@ y &quot; place . you &apos;re committed .
what happens if it doesn &apos;t work out ?
why isn &apos;t it working out ?
sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
is he not cute enough ? does he not make enough money ?
no , i &apos;m just
maybe there &apos;s someone else .
ls there someone else ?
no , there is no one else .
then why are you dumping my brother ?
hey , big spender !
she &apos;s still asleep .
so how &apos;d it go ?
you know how you think you &apos;re great ?
the fact you &apos;d even ask shows how little you know me .
last night i couldn &apos;t do the thing that usually makes me great .
so i had to do all this other stuff .
and the response i got ! man , oh , man !
it was like a ticker @-@ tape parade !
i know . my room &apos;s very , very close to the parade route .
it was amazing , and not just for her . for me too !
it &apos;s like , all of a sudden i &apos;m blind ...
... but all my other senses are heightened .
it &apos;s like i was able to appreciate it ...
... on another level .
i didn &apos;t know you had another level .
i know . neither did l !
is something going on with o.j. ?
hey , great skirt . birthday present ?
from who ?
you .
i exchanged the blouse you got me .
well , it &apos;s the thought .
doesn &apos;t ross &apos;flight get in in a couple hours ? at gate 27b ?
yeah . monica , you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about it .
i &apos;ve decided this ross thing is not a good idea .
why ?
i feel like i wouldn &apos;t just be going out with him .
i &apos;d be going out with all of you . there &apos;d be pressure
no pressure , no pressure !
nothing has happened , and you &apos;re already so
i &apos;m not &quot; so . &quot; okay , i was a teensy bit weird at first ...
... but i &apos;ll be good . i promise .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me , carl .
come on up .
behind my brother &apos;s back ?
is the kind of crazy thing you won &apos;t be hearing from me .
seven hundred bucks !
all right , you did it !
do we have any fruit ?
man , hell of a two weeks .
you know what ? i feel i learned something .
you &apos;ll stick with this &quot; all for her &quot; thing ?
what are you , crazy ?
when a blind man gets his sight back , does he walk around like this ?
if i see one more picture of ed begley jr ...
... in that stupid electric car , i &apos;m gonna shoot myself !
i &apos;m not against environmental issues , per se ...
... it &apos;s just that guy !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .
excuse me , i &apos;m trying to have a date here .
fine . just stop thinking about me .
can &apos;t do it , can you ?
i &apos;m thinking about you . so what ?
i don &apos;t get it . what do you see in this guy ?
happens to be a very nice guy .
i mean , come on , buddy ! get a real car !
rachel , come on . give us a chance .
ross , it &apos;s too hard .
why , because it &apos;ll get weird for everyone else ? this is about us .
i &apos;ve been in love with you since the ninth grade .
you &apos;re like my best friend . if we broke up , and i lost you
what makes you think that ?
have you been involved where you haven &apos;t broken up ?
no .
but it only has to happen once .
you and i both know we are perfect for each other . right ?
so the only question is : are you attracted to me ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i &apos;ve never looked at you that way before .
well , start looking .
wow .
exactly !
and i &apos;m gonna be the guy ...
... caught behind this hammerhead in traffic !
right ! you &apos;re right .
you know what ?
i &apos;m supposed to pick up a friend at the airport .
i am so sorry !
if you wanna finish your drinks , please do .
i &apos;m sorry , i gotta go . i &apos;m sorry .
but ....
where are you going ?
to get ross .
my god , this is so exciting !
i know .
if you want the rest of my date , i &apos;m not gonna finish it .
rachel , he &apos;s not a sandwich .
no , he &apos;s a banker with opera tickets .
hello !
where you going ?
