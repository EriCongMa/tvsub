《 邮差总是送老鼠 》 上映中
merry christmas , movie house !
merry christmas , mr. mouse !
hey @-@ hey . due to modern sensitivity ,
we &apos;ve been asked to block any violent images
that appear in this children &apos;s cartoon .
oh , my god !
i never watched one of these sober !
i gotta get this bloodbath off my kids &apos; show !
damn it !
aw , geez , when did everything turn to crap ?
bart , don &apos;t use language like that .
man , things sure have turned to crap .
homer ,
you have to take the halloween decorations down
before you put the christmas ones up .
marge , to that i say , boo , humbug .
there &apos;s a new grinch this holiday season ,
and its name is &quot; global warming . &quot;
meteorologists warn there &apos;ll be no snow this christmas
anywhere in america , not even in alaska ,
where the eskimos now have a hundred words for &quot; nothing . &quot;
global warming . huh .
by pure coincidence , every scientist was right .
but it &apos;s not all doom and gloom .
illegal poachers are having a field day .
* 80 degrees , water won &apos;t freeze *
* god help us , please , no one &apos;s on skis *
* happy , happy , happy , happy hunting *
* happy , happy , happy , happy hunting *
sorry , kids , i guess the hats and mittens will have
to wait until next year .
snow ?
snow !
oh , you know what this means , kids ?
i don &apos;t have to pick up the dog poops !
uh , so you see , the &quot; snow &quot;
is a microclimate aberration
caused by radioactive steam from the nuclear plant
and , of course , tire fire particulate .
so , we &apos;re the only place in america with snow ,
if you can call it that . i guess you can .
don &apos;t you idiots see what this means ? !
idiots ? why do we reelect this guy ?
&apos;cause his opponent has a long slavic name .

that has snow this christmas .
so tourists are going to want to come here .

i say we welcome our winter tourists with open arms ,
then gouge the hell out of &apos; em !
who ? who will gouge with me ?
i , too , will gouge !
duff beer is proud to make a corporate commitment to gouging !
here come the tourists .

why would a robot need mittens ?
why would a little boy need an aspirin ?
i don &apos;t know .
the one thing bongo comics are good for .
are you okay , chief ?
i &apos;ll be fine , i &apos;ll be fine .
god , i bent down to pick up a piece of candy
and rolled down a hill .
you always think it &apos;s the other guy
that &apos;ll turn into a giant snowball .
never you .
have you seen lou ?
there &apos;s snow in my lungs !
lot of attitude in that hand , lou .
lot of attitude .
look at all these out @-@ of @-@ state license plates .
&quot; first in freeways , &quot;
&quot; the &apos; yuh @-@ huh &apos; state , &quot;
&quot; jewel of the fracking belt &quot; ?
&quot; still a british colony at heart , &quot;
&quot; land of many water snakes &quot; ?
valet parking , five dollars .
people , i &apos;m completely out of milk !
i do have several dvds of the movie milk ,
an inspiring return to form for director gus van sant .
uh , do you have life of pi ?
no , but i have some home movies of me on a canoe with a big dog .
people who have never seen a movie say it is a good movie .
we can &apos;t afford christmas .
and when you can &apos;t afford christmas ,
you &apos;ve failed as a family .
that &apos;s what all the big stores say .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m so sorry to bother you ,
but my kids are exhausted and the town is sold out .
is there any chance you &apos;d have a spare room for us ?
well , there &apos;s a rec room off the kitchen ,
but sometimes it &apos;s there and sometimes it isn &apos;t .
our house is very odd that way .
please ? please , ma &apos;am ?
we &apos;d pay you $ 300 a night .
well , you seem like a nice , pushy stranger .
ma &apos;am , because we talk this way ,
people always think that we &apos;re , um ...
uh , what is that word , honey ?
passive @-@ aggressive .
right , right , but we &apos;re not .
please , please take our money and everybody wins .
oh , good . marge remarried after i died .
wait a minute . i &apos;m not dead .
what &apos;s going on ? !
these are our new boarders .
uh @-@ uh . no way . i &apos;m not sharing my bed with anybody except you .
and maybe that guy . lincoln @-@ style .
but that &apos;s it .
this is a great thing .
we &apos;re helping people celebrate christmas ,
and we &apos;ll be able to afford christmas .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
it won &apos;t seem like christmas
without opening up a giant credit card bill in january .
take a look at this .
提供床位及早餐
what the ... ?
&quot; the simpson bed and breakfast &quot; ?
i always wanted to stay in a place like this .
but christmas is a special time .
and i like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football .
homer simpson , ask yourself ,
w.w.b.j.d. ?
huh ?
what would baby jesus do ?
* my baby she told me she don &apos;t want to hold me *
* and kiss my lips anymore *
* she &apos;s gonna leave me *
* and she don &apos;t believe me *
* that i &apos;ll be true now *
* well , maybe she don &apos;t love me *
* and is not thinkin &apos; of me *
* but why &apos;d she do it this time of year ? *
* she knows that i &apos;ll miss her and i &apos;ll want to kiss her *
* if just for christmas *
* merry christmas ... *
well , this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior
i want to encourage in you .
mmm ... i &apos;m in ! 100 % !
oh , thank you .
now , homie , table three needs more bread .
i &apos;m on a break .
welcome to our day care center .
all girls , please move to cootie quarantine .
we &apos;ve got a two @-@ month @-@ old .
are you sure you can handle her ?
just don &apos;t lose this claim ticket .
欢迎非本镇人士前来
that church doesn &apos;t look very inspiring .
what a bland marquee .
it doesn &apos;t look very inviting .
this whole crowd &apos;s gonna be at my sermon today .
darling , did st. paul worry about the crowds ?
oh , he wrote letters . any fool can write letters .
lord , i &apos;m just a small @-@ town minister .
we don &apos;t have mormon money .
but if you could see your way to guiding my fingers
as i type this sermon ...
oh , yeah .
oh , this is black @-@ church good .
my friends ...
when he starts with &quot; my friends , &quot; it &apos;s always bad .
friends , every year ,
i tell you this holiday is about the birth of our lord ,
not singing santas and full stockings .
you &apos;re losing us !
christmas is not about what happened in a manger
some 2,000 years ago .
it is about what you do for others now .
get my the church bulletin .
lovejoy &apos;s on fire .
christmas is the holy spirit .
ooh , i didn &apos;t know there were doves in there .
give with your hearts !
give with your acts !
and you will know
the true meaning of christmas .
wow , what a showman .
i haven &apos;t felt this inspired
since the blueberries at breakfast .
daddy , permission for a religious fit ?
a brief one .
i said a fit , not a fervor .
that sermon really inspired me .
this whole christmas has been about money .
oh , are you with the salvation army ?
what makes you think that ?
bless you .
but i &apos;m gonna give gifts that aren &apos;t expensive
and come from the heart .
i don &apos;t know .
christmas didn &apos;t get to be the number one holiday
by being about love .
um , when a woman talks , she just wants to be heard .
where &apos;s the end ?
hey , marge , we &apos;re running out of chestnuts over here .
well , they don &apos;t grow on trees .
uh , yeah , they do .
what about our romantic carriage ride through the snow ?
setting it up .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re giving them
what they were promised , dad .
the secret is : don &apos;t read the comment cards .
where do the people sit ?
i thought they were just gonna watch me .
excuse me .
this eggnog is terrible .
all eggnog is terrible .
those stockings are not hung by the chimney with care .
why did i do this for money ?
why did i do this for money ?
and the christmas special on your television
is one of the worst .
we now return to king winter feasts on his children .
by the time princess summer comes to save you ,
you &apos;ll all be blood in my beard .
your own father &apos;s beard .
how long to see santa ?
how would i know ? i &apos;m an accountant .
i imagine for small business , huh ?
god , i hate christmas .
mr. flanders , where &apos;s your store ?
well , i &apos;m down to a kiosk , thanks to that place .
actually , half a kiosk .
sharing it with nasreen here .
no cream is finer than mall kiosk cream .
j.lo use it .
no , thanks .
it is no wonder you are not married .
flip me back .
if i have to give presents ,
i &apos;ll give presents with a purpose .
one for maggie . check .

all that &apos;s left is bart.
no .
no .
no .
no , no , no ...
ah , perfect .
* all from satan &apos;s power *
* as we were gone astray *
* oh , tidings *
* of comfort and joy *
* in bethlehem , in israel this blessed babe was born *
enough . stop .
christmas carols only have one verse .
well , they may have more , but the second verse
is where they get all weird and religiousy .
uh , more wassail , please .
and don &apos;t skimp on the aromatic bitters .
for your information , gloria ,
my wassail is just gatorade i put in the microwave .
i drank that under the mistletoe .
it &apos;s not mistletoe ,
just cherries and lettuce .
i thought when i ate it , it wasn &apos;t poisonous .
i &apos;ve opened up my house to you
and all you do is fill this joyous season
with petty complaints .
not now . take out that pillow
and put it in room three .
the pillow acted as a girdle .
any more questions ?
uh , yes , will the pudding be figgy ?
the pudding will be jell @-@ o.
quite so .
i &apos;m going to sulk in my room .
the only thing good about this place is the piano player .
an angelica button wizard robe .
with wand pocket .
and wand .
professor digglesby &apos;s wand .
now i have every wizarding stick
from the spells and potions department
of wagglepoofs academy .
don &apos;t make me learn about it .
i know this christmas has been a little rocky ,
even for the simpsons ,
but i think these gifts born of thought and love
will restore the balance of prajna and samsara .
i mean holly and jolly .
now , dad , i &apos;d like to give you your present .
you got me weed ?
even better .
they &apos;re bags of seeds .
so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow .
that &apos;s great , sweetie .
after all that time and hard work , i &apos;ll have ...
radishes ? !
it &apos;s the most hated part of salad ,
which is the most hated part of dinner .
radishes , nothing but radishes .
dad , stop .
what ? i &apos;m saving them from the struggle of life .
well , at least you &apos;re eating vegetables .
vegetables ? !
okay , bart , open your present .
it &apos;s the one i &apos;m most excited about .
plastic bubbling vomit , plastic bubbling vomit .
what ? lis , you &apos;re smart .
why would you give me a book ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s easy to wrap ?
nothing is easy to wrap .
i have trouble with scissors .
marge , the brochure promised us a happy christmas .
my uncle died in your bed .
merry christmas .
what ?
n.c. wyeth .
these are book illustrations .
stop it ! stop it !
why in the world would you burn a book ?
actually , the idea to do this came from a book .
fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury ?
what ? no , i got it from this .
see ?
how could you burn the present i gave you ?
because it &apos;s my present .
did you give it to me because you thought i &apos;d like it
or because you wanted to feel better about yourself ?
children , perhaps it &apos;s time that i explain
the true meaning of christmas .
shut up , flanders .
okily @-@ dokily .
now , did you check the room to make sure
you haven &apos;t left anything ?
all set .
need directions or a bottle of water ?
no , thanks . we &apos;re fine .
thank you , sir .
oh , right , we &apos;re still doing that .
come on . i &apos;ll drive you to the airport .
where are my keys ? oh , right in here .
bart , you were right .
if you smell your farts in a dream , you die ?
no , about christmas .
so i went out this morning and i got you this .
it &apos;s a tablet with books on it ,
but also apps , like worms with friends .
wow . but how &apos;d you afford it ?
i sold the gift you gave me .
get the twist ?
obviously .
you &apos;re saying it &apos;s from maggie ,
but actually it &apos;s from you .
thanks , lis .
now , why don &apos;t you donate that
to whatever hopeless cause you want .
thanks , bart.
this will make a lot of arctic loons very happy .
uh , listen ,
i just wanted to say
i &apos;m sorry i overreacted .
thank you all for coming .
yeah , well , we have something to say to you , marge .
* we wish you a merry christmas *
* we wish you a merry christmas *
* we wish you a merry christmas *
* and a happy new year . *
* good tidings we bring ... *
no second verses .
they creep me out .
okay , we &apos;ll sing a different one .
* good king wenceslas looked out *
* on the feast of stephen ... *
oh , that one creeps me out from the beginning .
* when the snow lay round about *
* deep and crisp and even *
oh , the happy sound of a blender .
