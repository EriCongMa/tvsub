what am i most afraid of ? hmm . let &apos;s see .
global warming ... and getting a &quot; b. &quot;
the phone ringing in the middle of the night .
that i &apos;m too much of a perfectionist .
honey , this isn &apos;t a job interview .
oh , man .
job interviews .
nothing .
yeah , right . what about the pigeons ?
oh , i don &apos;t like them . they &apos;re shifty .
losing mitchell .
oh !
hotel bedspreads .
ooh .
never getting my driver &apos;s license .
or getting one and the picture sucks .
dying alone .
oh , haley , sweetie , did you find your shoes ?
mom , please , not today .
i just wanted to know if you found your shoes .
why are you hounding me ? i &apos;m freaking out right now .
you need to relax . it &apos;s just a driver &apos;s test .
it &apos;s my third driver &apos;s test , and if i fail again ,
i have to wait six months to retake it .
that &apos;s six more months of you driving me everywhere .
then i &apos;m , like , &quot; there &apos;s no way i &apos;m wearing that . &quot;
and she was , like . &quot; well , if you don &apos;t wear it ,
like
then you can &apos;t play . &quot;
and then i was , like , &quot; that &apos;s fine by me . &quot;
honey , like .
and then she was , like , &quot; well , if you don &apos;t play &quot;
like ! like !
mom !
stop ! stop saying &quot; like &quot; all the time .
you &apos;re embarrassing me !
stop it ! like , like , like , like , aah !
haley . found your jacket .
why is everyone on me ? god !
ignore her .
she can &apos;t focus on two things at once .
always a good quality in a driver .
sweetie , we need to get you some shoes for the dance tonight .
no , we don &apos;t . i &apos;m not going .
what are you talking about ?
why would you not be going to the dance ?
because school dances are lame .
a bunch of immature boys
trying to impress you with how cool they are ...
when they &apos;re really just a bunch of dorks .
ready to go down under , mate ?
yes .
what are you doing ?
treasure hunting .
a few days ago , the cable guy was under the house .
when he was leaving , he said to haley ,
&quot; wow . that &apos;s quite a collection you &apos;ve got down there . &quot;
here &apos;s the thing . we have no idea what he &apos;s talking about .
all week , luke and i have been getting more and more
excited about what it could be .
i bet it &apos;s really cool old magazines .
yeah . or a bunch of necklaces made out of animal teeth .
or bugs frozen in amber .
what if it &apos;s really expensive bottles of wine ?
or a suit of armor .
what if there &apos;s ancient indian arrowheads under there ?
what if it &apos;s gold bars ?
oh , you think ?
for god sakes , why don &apos;t you go under the house and look ?
第一季第十六集
hey , cam . cam , where did we get this dolly from ?
from janice and olivia .
they brought it over yesterday . lily loves it .
seems a little frilly , you know , coming from them .
what , because they &apos;re lesbians ?
that &apos;s sort of an offense stereotype , don &apos;t you think ?
yeah , i suppose . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , hey , did they bring back our coffee maker ?
no . it was too big . they were on their motorcycle .
we got off to an awkward start with our pediatrician ,
a very nice asian lady-
irrelevant .
named dr. miura .
so i took the bold step of inviting her over for brunch .
i &apos;m sorry . uh , bold ?
she said no patient had ever done it before .
yeah . subtext , &quot; this is weird . &quot;
i didn &apos;t hear any subtext .
do you hear any now ?
i don &apos;t even know why we &apos;re doing this .
because what if lily gets sick
and there &apos;s a tamiflu shortage ?
who do you think &apos;s gonna get that medicine ?
the patient she likes , that &apos;s who .
well , maybe if you bake her a cake ,
she &apos;ll give us free x @-@ rays .
it &apos;s all about making connections .
why do you think the dentist gives me all that free stuff ?
um , because he &apos;s a huge queen and he has a big crush on you .
really ? do you think so ?
mom ?
hmm ?
i have a fever .
ay , mi amor . come here and i feel you .
ooh . i don &apos;t wanna get you sick . it could be fatal .
then by all means , stand next to me .
let me feel you .
ay , papi , but you &apos;re not warm .
uh , probably because you were cooking and your hands are warm .
i better skip the party tomorrow just to be safe .
oh . yeah , the party .
what ?
the party .
i understand about 20 % of what goes on around here .
the party is at an amusement park ,
and manny &apos;s afraid of roller coasters .
poor kid .
i don &apos;t know where he gets his fear from ...
because his father &apos;s not afraid of anything .
no bulls , no heights ,
no helicopters , no fast cars-
but go to dinner with him and wait for the check to come .
then you &apos;ll see fear in his eyes .
like the waiter &apos;s a ghost .
excited ?
yeah .
we &apos;re like ponce de leon and his son , little ponce .
who &apos;s that ?
famous treasure hunters .
his name was ponce ? he &apos;d get made fun of at my school .
they &apos;d probably call him &quot; pants . &quot;
pants .
or maybe , um , &quot; fancy ponce . &quot;
that &apos;s a good one .
all right .
let &apos;s do this .
you okay , dad ?
yeah . yeah , i am .
yep . gonna take a little more
than getting trapped in a small , dark space with a wild animal
to rattle your old man .
all right .
you never want your kids to see you scared .
you wanna be that rock
that they can grab ahold of in a stormy sea .
actually , a rock would sink . so a floating rock .
let &apos;s start over . it &apos;s windy , and you &apos;ve got a lot of papers .
okay . let &apos;s do this , buddy .
okay ! good recon .
got the lay of the land , so-
aren &apos;t we going in ?
yep , we are .
but won &apos;t it be fun if we did it with ski goggles and barbecue tools ?
i guess .
yeah .
yeah . let &apos;s do that .
all right .
can i just say that is a lovely outfit .
oh . thank you .
well , it &apos;s just nice to see you out of your lab coat .
you actually have quite a nice figure .
take it down a notch .
we &apos;re trying to make a friend , not initiate a three @-@ way .
lily looks great .
do you think so ?
shouldn &apos;t she have more teeth ?
i see these kids running around at the park ,
and they look like sharks .
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;s perfect . aren &apos;t you , lily ?
oh , look how calm she is with you .
she &apos;s usually very fidgety around new people .
well , i just think she senses
you &apos;re gonna be a good friend for her ...
during good times and- and flu season .
mommy .
did she just-
did she just say-
well , her first word ...
was every gay father &apos;s worst nightmare .
&quot; mommy . &quot;
oh .
jay , he won &apos;t admit it ,
but i know that manny &apos;s sad because he &apos;s missing the party .
why don &apos;t we take him somewhere to take his mind off it , hmm ?
i could have guessed he &apos;d have trouble with roller coasters .
that kid gets woozy at barbershops
when they spin his chair towards the mirror .
how about we take him to the pier and go fishing , huh ? manny !
he likes to fish ?
yeah .
he comes from a long line of fishermen and smugglers .
but i encourage the fishing .
manny , you like to fish ?
fishing ? yeah .
you want to go to the pier today ?
is this a trick to see if i &apos;m really sick ?
no .
maybe the fresh air will make you feel better .
well , then yeah , &apos; cause there &apos;s no place
where i &apos;m more at one with
just get your coat .
are you nervous ?
shut up , alex .
i was just asking . i &apos;d be nervous if i were you .
alex , leave your sister alone . she &apos;s gonna be fine .
as long as i don &apos;t get the same guy . he &apos;s so mean .
you probably will .
you won &apos;t .
he hates me .
he doesn &apos;t hate you .
he yelled at me .
you drove into the bushes .
oh , no . it &apos;s him . please don &apos;t be for me . please don &apos;t be for me .
please don &apos;t be for me . please don &apos;t be me . hi .
oh , thank god .
well , come on . i don &apos;t have all day .
i &apos;m gonna throw up .
okay , no . this is what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna get in that car , put on your seat belt ...
and take three deep breaths and relax .
this guy sees hundreds of kids every day .
he probably doesn &apos;t even remember you , all right ?
okay .
yo . let &apos;s move it , two strikes .
that &apos;s more than three breaths , honey .
see how much better this is ?
the truck goes in . it gets video .
and then we get a preview of whatever &apos;s in there .
how ingenious is that , huh ?
are you just scared to go in ?
why would you say that ?
well , when you stuck your head in , you screamed a little .
i told you . that was the house settling .
besides , this is so much cooler . this is how nasa does it .
now , hand me the ltty bitty book light .
yeah . final piece of the puzzle .
blast off .
hey , dad ?
yeah ?
how are you supposed to steer if you don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going ?
stay in the present , buddy . gotta do it by feel .
gotta get all jedi on it .
did you just lose my truck ?
no .
you just lost my truck !
no , i didn &apos;t !
that was my truck ! grandpa just gave it to me !
i told you to stay in the present !
stop yelling !
truce ?
yeah . sorry .
this is delicious .
oh . thank you .
the recipe &apos;s from the now @-@ defunct gourmet magazine .
why do all the things i love go away ?
look , i don &apos;t even think she said the &quot; m &quot; word .
no , we heard it . it was clear as day .
i- i just don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve done wrong .
i quit my job so i could stay at home with her .
but maybe it &apos;s not enough .
maybe we &apos;re not providing her
with the feminine energy that she needs .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t be too concerned about that .
you- you know it &apos;s because you &apos;re asian , right ?
cam .
no , i &apos;m sorry . what ?
am i just supposed to ignore the giant panda in the room ?
pandas are from china . i- well , it doesn &apos;t matter .
okay , okay . i think what my hysterical partner
is just trying to say , if i may ,
that for the first six months of her life ,
lily was raised by very loving asian women , in an orphanage ,
with whom she clearly bonded .
and then suddenly you come in with all of your asian @-@ ness ...
and @-@ and @-@ and breasts and womb , lady bits-
and it all just comes rushing back to her , and i-
you guys are overreacting .
i &apos;m sure lily just strung a couple of random syllables together ,
and they happen to sound something like that word .
but that &apos;s all .
do you really think that ?
of course .
she &apos;s right . she &apos;s right .
we &apos;re being ridiculous .
we &apos;re being ridiculous .
your daddies are being ridiculous .
mommy .
okay . well-
mr. tucker
no , no , no .
she &apos;s made her choice ! she &apos;s made her choice .
all right , left turn .
here ?
at the intersection , yeah .
okay .
left .
what ?
i said left . you &apos;re going right .
wait . no , wait . i &apos;m trying , okay ?
pull over .
no , i can do this !
pull over now .
why are you crying ?
why do you hate me ?
oh , hell . haley , i don &apos;t hate you .
you seem like a nice girl . you remind me of my daughter .
which is why i want you to live a long and happy life ...
and be safe and not hurt my daughter .
i really want my license .
i &apos;ve been practicing a lot , i swear .
you gonna drink and drive ?
no , sir .
you gonna text and drive ?
no , sir .
all right . let &apos;s start this from the beginning .
could you smile first ?
i &apos;ll be less nervous if you smile .
okay , that didn &apos;t help .
just go .
today feels like a good day for halibut .
hey , jay , did i ever tell you about the time ...
i used peanut butter and jelly for bait
and i caught a thresher shark ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me a lot of funny things .
why are we going this way ?
it &apos;s just another way to go .
uh @-@ oh . something &apos;s going on .
what are you talking about ?
wake up , old man .
she &apos;s trying to get me on that roller coaster .
no , she &apos;s not .
yes , i am .
what ?
told you .
manny , you have to face your fears .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here ?
why didn &apos;t you let me in on your little plan ?
because you &apos;re the worst liar .
he would have seen right through you .
i don &apos;t wanna go on the roller coaster .
manny , you were afraid to light the barbecue ,
but now your eyebrows have grown back ...
and your salmon is legendary .
what if i fall out ?
i will catch you .
that &apos;s not possible . he would crush you .
what if i throw up ?
i will clean it up . it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
geez , these are new shoes .
you &apos;re not gonna let up , are you ?
baby , i think you know the answer .
fine . let &apos;s get it over with .
that &apos;s my boy . vamos , jay .
no , i &apos;m not going on that . that &apos;s bad for my back .
your back is fine .
i got an inner @-@ ear thing .
oh , please . don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re scared too .
scared ?
what is this &quot; scared &quot; stuff from ?
what am i , a child ? i &apos;m not scared .
you see ? you &apos;re the worst liar .
well , if he &apos;s not going , i &apos;m not going .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , fine ! i &apos;ll go alone .
here . take my girlie purse
and you my floppy hat ,
and if you need it , there &apos;s the ladies &apos; room .
i &apos;m not man enough to fight this .
here . hold my purse .
oh , hell !
what &apos;s taking them so long ?
i don &apos;t know .
the only reason i &apos;m not panicking is i haven &apos;t seen a giant geyser .
you know , honey , i think i know why you don &apos;t wanna go tonight .
because school dances are lame ?
no .
&apos;cause you don &apos;t know how to dance .
that &apos;s not it .
i can help you with that . come on .
come on .
oh , god , no . no , mom .
oh , yeah . back in the day , i was quite the dancer .
oh , my god . you and dad together suddenly makes so much sense .
mom . mom , stop . stop .
please , stop . i know how to dance .
i just don &apos;t wanna be part of that freak show .
sweetheart , you &apos;re a beautiful girl .
someone will ask you to dance .
i know that . it &apos;s just stupid .
somebody will ask you .
why do you keep saying that ?
somebody will ask you .
but what if they don &apos;t ?
honey , if they don &apos;t ,
then you do the exact same thing i told your sister , okay ?
take three deep breaths and relax .
even the advice i get is a hand @-@ me @-@ down .
mom , i did it ! i passed !
oh , my god !
i got my license !
congratulations !
i have my license ! i got my license !
car &apos;s not in &quot; park . &quot;
oh . oops .
you better run to that counter .
go . right now .
run ! run !
still can &apos;t believe you lost my truck .
it &apos;s gone , buddy . let it go .
you know , maybe it &apos;s better we don &apos;t solve this little mystery .
sometimes treasure &apos;s more sparkly in your imagination .
or it could be gold or baseball cards or pirate maps .
do you really think there could be pirate maps under there ?
i &apos;m a hundred percent sure it &apos;s possible .
all right . i &apos;m going in .
what ?
really ? buddy .
what do you see ?
nothing . it &apos;s really dark in here .
wait a minute . i think i see my truck .
it &apos;s right over there by the- uh @-@ oh .
what ?
i think i &apos;m stuck .
how are you stuck ?
my belt loop got caught on a pipe .
and it &apos;s hot .
have you tried wiggling ?
dad , it &apos;s hot ! hurry !
i &apos;m coming , buddy !
and hurry . there &apos;s spiders in here .
coming !
i &apos;m sorry if we got all weird in there .
no . it was fine .
well , we &apos;d like to say it &apos;s different than how it usually is ,
but you &apos;ve seen us enough to know that that &apos;s not true .
guys , listen .
i had a very complicated relationship with my mother .
she was born in japan- crazy traditional .
she didn &apos;t want me to become a doctor .
she wanted me to get married and have kids .
but my father , we would talk ...
and he would actually listen to what i wanted .
anyway , what i &apos;m trying to say ...
is having a mother isn &apos;t always what it &apos;s cracked up to be .
oh ! thank you .
well , thank you .
and if you ask me ,
having two fathers who care as much as you do ...
makes lily the luckiest little girl in the world .
oh ! thank you so much .
thank you . thank you for that .
that &apos;s very sweet . thanks .
thank you .
and how are things with you and your mom now ?
the only way she &apos;ll be happy is if i &apos;m some asian stereotype .
but that just isn &apos;t me .
i didn &apos;t see those !
i &apos;m coming , buddy .
over here .
that &apos;s ... a spider web . oh , god .
my boy was in trouble ,
so i put my fears aside , and i came to his rescue .
now , does that make me a hero ?
yes , it does .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
hey . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
there .
thanks , dad .
hey , that &apos;s what dads do . let &apos;s get out of here .
i want my truck .
really ?
it was a christmas gift .
could you go get it ?
yeah . yeah .
sure . let &apos;s go- let &apos;s go through it .
yeah . there it is .
got it .
you okay ?
yeah . are you okay ?
you know what ? i am okay .
we did it .
we &apos;re under the house .
what the heck . we &apos;re down here .
why don &apos;t we see what we got , huh ?
yeah .
two intrepid explorers ...
make their way on a journey-
dead bodies !
we called the police and got a bunch of detectives over .
turns out it was the last owner &apos;s halloween decorations ,
which is pretty funny .
least i thought it was .
everybody &apos;s afraid of something , right ?
heights , clowns , tight spaces .
you like it , jay ?
i did it !
those are things you get over .
but then there &apos;s our children .
will they fit in ?
will they be safe ?
those are fears you never get past .
so sometimes all you can do ...
is take a deep breath , pull &apos; em close ...
and hope for the best .
bye !
eyes on the road .
love you !
eyes on the road .
oh , god .
i mean , things don &apos;t always work out .
oh . cam , i think she wants her doll .
i don &apos;t know where it is .
mommy .
mommy .
when you squeeze the doll , it says &quot; mommy . &quot;
did @-@ did you know that
not a clue .
the doll says &quot; mommy . &quot;
the doll says &quot; mommy . &quot;
the doll says &quot; mommy . &quot;
but you gotta love it when they do .
hey , dad .
hmm ?
mom says there &apos;s an old trunk in the attic .
oh , yeah . my grandpa &apos;s old steamer trunk .
in this movie i saw , there was this old trunk ...
and there &apos;s a secret compartment .
and when you opened it , there was a whole bunch of paintings ,
by the world &apos;s greatest painters , hidden in the war .
my grandpa was in the war .
should we go up there ?
totally . it could also be diamonds .
or a samurai sword .
or the declaration of independence .
you know , it almost doesn &apos;t even matter what &apos;s up there .
what matters is what you do with the money from what &apos;s up there .
we could get a motorboat .
or a robotic gutter cleaner .
or an indoor pool .
or a two @-@ man submarine .
