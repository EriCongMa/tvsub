david !
so you never looked at porter for the murder , huh ?
he was in with reyes and me when grayson got whacked .
i knew you &apos;d have questions about amanda .
did you give her the money ?
i gave her everything .
i want to do something for david --
something that might give you
a way around victoria &apos;s media blackout .
i have found a way
to put your father &apos;s scandal behind you .
that &apos;s the deed to your beach house .
what are you doing ?
atoning for my father &apos;s sins .
give me exclusive rights to david &apos;s story .
provided you give us final approval on all stories .
and for a minute , i thought i could be
the guy i was with you yesterday , but ...
we keep things strictly professional .
please connect me to page six .
i have a story about daniel grayson .
never thought i &apos;d be going home with charlotte grayson .
it &apos;s &quot; clarke . &quot;
my mistake .
when are you gonna tell him ?
when he &apos;s ready .
daddy ! daddy !
look what you found .
but he &apos;s missing an arm .
yeah , but he &apos;s got four more .
you know what &apos;s cool ? he &apos;s gonna grow that one back .
but first , he has to go back home .
hey ! i wanted to watch it grow !
oh , yeah , but that takes a long time
and a lot of saltwater .
okay , that &apos;s it . come on !
good morning .
vince ?
there you are .
hey , where &apos;s all my stuff ?
make yourself comfortable .
no , i @-@ i got to get home .
i know this must be confusing , especially after last night .
i usually don &apos;t sleep with the bait , but ...
how could i resist ?
the bait ? bait for what ?
a fish i &apos;ve been after for a very long time .
good morning .
i bet the ocean is happy to have you back in her arms .
you got my message .
how was your first night here ?
surreal .
almost like nothing had changed .
you know , after your arrest ,
i held on to this place for years .
i used to come and stay here for hours
and imagine myself here with you .
i always was too sentimental .
i &apos;ve arranged for the tailor to come for a fitting later .
tv crew comes at 4 : 00 .
can &apos;t believe you set this up so quickly .
well , margaux is a very close friend .
you can &apos;t underestimate the hunger of the audience to know your story .
david .
are you sure you want to tell it ?
i need to set the record straight .
there &apos;s people out there that still think i &apos;m a terrorist .
right .
they need to see that i was a victim ,
that i was betrayed .
yeah .
well , maybe we should go over some talking points .
there will be millions watching , and --
well , that &apos;s the good thing about the truth --
you don &apos;t need talking points .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
hacking into the fbi
should get harder as i get older , but ...
nope .
wham , bam , thanks , uncle sam .
would you do if your bestie wasn &apos;t a keyboard cowboy ,
besides , well , actually talk to your father ?
i told you , i &apos;m giving him space .
and downloading his confidential psychiatric assessment
isn &apos;t an invasion of said space ?
i want to help him , and in order to do that ,
i need to know what he &apos;s been through .
you should have seen his wounds , nolan .
you mean these ?
it says these bastards whipped him with chains .
let &apos;s see the interview .
i can barely stomach this , ems .
i don &apos;t think we should watch this video .
no , i need to know what happened .
and i want to hear it from him .
well , then , let it play .
please .
you can &apos;t do this to me . i &apos;m only 19 .
i &apos;m just starting my life .
i just got my father back .
please .
i know what you &apos;re trying to do here --
spout off a bunch of personal details ,
make yourself seem like a real person .
it &apos;s not gonna work .
where was this enthusiasm last night ?
go ahead , kid .
let &apos;s see if you can get it .
bitch !
oh , my god .
while you were incarcerated ,
would you say your primary emotion was fear ?
anger ? helplessness ?
fear , at first ...
that i wouldn &apos;t see the sun again or ...
that i wouldn &apos;t be able to surve the torture .
then , over time , i would stop feeling .
and now , since you &apos;ve been out ?
i know that i &apos;m supposed to feel relieved and thankful .
but i &apos;m -- i don &apos;t .
i feel more alone out here than i ever felt in there .
have you found yourself prone to mood swings ,
violent impulses ?
thank you for your time . we &apos;re done .
so , what was his diagnosis ?
complex ptsd .
&quot; psychological fragmentation ,
a loss of a sense of safety and trust . &quot;
what else does it say ?
what else are you looking for ?
i just feel like there &apos;s more to the story .
it &apos;s all right here .
fbi tends to be pretty thorough .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s a gut instinct , nolan .
i can &apos;t explain it .
well , maybe his interview tonight will .
if he &apos;s hiding something from the fbi ,
he &apos;s not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television .
ems , i respect your instinct ,
but i think you &apos;re looking for an easier answer .
&apos;cause the truth is anything but .
it &apos;s hard to accept that this happened to someone that we loved .
but it did .
so , i assume you saw page six .
oh , no . what have i done now ?
they ran a story on you and one miss louise ellis .
they ran a what ?
quite the little sexpot , isn &apos;t she ?
oh , god .
no , it &apos;s good news .
&quot; louise ellis lands in new york
and hires daniel grayson to manage her millions . &quot;
seems like you &apos;re back in the game , big boy .
how &apos;s , uh , how &apos;s the interview coming together ?
rapidly .
i have one last call to make to our station director in tokyo ,
and then i can finally catch my breath .
join me for some tennis later ?
no , i can &apos;t .
a realtor &apos;s showing me some office spaces .
thanks to your beach @-@ house p.r. stunt ,
my phone &apos;s been ringing off the hook .
when it rains. à bient ? t .
ciao .
was that margaux ?
oh , my god .
how the hell did you get in here ?
i &apos;m your mother --
a fact that you don &apos;t respect , but your doorman does .
i was hoping to catch margaux here .
it &apos;s urgent .
so is your boyfriend &apos;s interview that she &apos;s busy setting up .
yes , well , it &apos;s related .
i &apos;m worried .
david has been acting very strange with me lately ,
and i --
what is this ?
what are you doing with louise ellis ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
this girl is mentally imbalanced .
so she &apos;s a friend of yours .
i am serious , daniel .
when i disappeared after pascal &apos;s death ,
i &apos;d fallen apart , and i needed help ,
so i checked in to a psychiatric hospital .
hold on a second .
that &apos;s where you were all that time ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i couldn &apos;t bear for you to see my life in shambles .
in there , louise was my roommate .
and now that she &apos;s hired you ,
i &apos;m highly suspect of her intentions .
look , even if louise isn &apos;t stable ,
her bank accounts certainly are .
believe me . i can handle her .
you once said the exact same thing about emily thorne .

大卫 · 克拉克被定罪
i hate to end on a low note ,
but for those who knew former officer jim mostrowski ,
just got news he passed away .
heart attack .
there is a wake at his house tonight .
you stop by if you can to pay your respects .
that &apos;s it . stay safe .
ready when you are .
yeah , give me a sec .
hey , willard , hold up .
that &apos;s the same mostrowski that moved up
to fulton correctional , isn &apos;t it ?
is anyone looking into his death ?
considering --
is this going where i think it &apos;s going ?
no , i &apos;m just saying , according to that case file ,
mostrowski beat up conrad grayson
right before grayson was murdered .
the chief told you to drop this .
besides , mo was cleared .
yeah , but now that he &apos;s showing up dead --
yeah , from a heart attack .
watch your partner , porter .
last week , he &apos;d have given his left nut to pin this on you .
jack . what ?
jack , wait up !
porter , i know you &apos;re pissed .
just give me a second to explain .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
when did you start telling everyone at the station
you thought i was a murderer ?
you &apos;re unbelievable .
look , come on . i dropped it soon as
i found out that you had an alibi .
oh , okay . well , that makes me feel better .
look , all i &apos;ve ever wanted was to become a detective , all right ?
solving a cold case like this -- that would do that for me .
do you really want to make your career this way ?
whoever killed conrad deserves a medal .
and you wonder why i suspected you .
come on . after everything you said he did to you ,
your wife , your brother --
you telling me the thought of killing that bastard
never crossed your mind ?
even if it had , that &apos;s not the point .
you &apos;re a beat cop . you &apos;re not a detective .
and the chief told you to drop this ,
so if you don &apos;t , it reflects badly on me , your partner .
so stop being a pain in the ass and find a new hobby
before you screw this job up for both of us .
where is he ?
his neck &apos;s broken .
why didn &apos;t you call the police ?
i was going to .
i was -- i was dialing them ,
but then i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what to make of all this .
he called me &quot; bait . &quot;
he was using me to get to our father .
but why ?
why would anyone want to hurt him ?
same make and model that tried to run down david the other day .
oh , god . i should have just called the police .
but i called you as a last resort ,
but he &apos;s our dad ,
and i thought after everything you &apos;d done to me , to our family ,
i thought maybe you could help .
based on this file ,
it looks like he was one of the remaining
flight 197 fanatics who still doubted david &apos;s innocence .
this guy deserved what he got .
what drugs were you doing ?
we were just drinking , maybe doing a little coke .
he offered me heroin , but i don &apos;t --
perfect . we &apos;re gonna need it .
i don &apos;t think i will ever get used to seeing you at my door .
come in .
thank you .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you told me --
that i shouldn &apos;t be so quick to trust just anyone .
you meant victoria , right ?
i
i know how you feel about the graysons ,
how you &apos;ve always felt .
and now i know now what they did to you and your company .
i wish could have been there for you , nolan ,
the way you &apos;ve always been there for me .
which is why , if you can , i would --
i would like it if you came to the interview tonight .
i need someone on my side in case i get cornered .
then i &apos;ll be there .
i &apos;m proud of you , nolan .
all your hard work -- it &apos;s paid off in spades .
i wouldn &apos;t have any of this
if you hadn &apos;t believed in me way back when .
but i did .
victoria ?
oh , thanks so much for reaching out to me .
i read the blurb in page six .
how exciting -- you and my son working together .
i did it for you , you know .
i knew daniel needed business , and ,
well , i just wanted to repay you
for the kindness you showed me at claremont .
now , i know our time there was brief , but ,
well , life is just a series of moments .
i was about to say the very same thing .
oh , louise , i &apos;m so happy we met .
you &apos;ve been a better child to me than my own blood , louise .
my own blood .
victoria .
thank you so much for reaching out to me .
please .
ms. grayson , your table is ready .
how perfect . i &apos;m famished .
actually , my lunch date is with someone else .
i &apos;m rather short on time , but we &apos;re overdue for a chat .
i hear you &apos;ll be working with my son .
now , of all the financial advisers in manhattan ,
how did that happen ?
well , it was practically your idea .
i never mentioned daniel to you .
well , no , but you did say
your family was struggling with finances .
if this is because i left you at claremont --
victoria , i told you .
i don &apos;t blame you for that .
i simply just want to repay the kindness
you showed me in there .
you were like a mother to me .
we were roommates for a day .
well , sure , but ...
... life is just a series of moments .
whatever does that mean ?
louise , i don &apos;t wish to sound ungrateful ,
but if your intentions toward my son
are anything other than honest ,
well , i &apos;m sure you know how terrifying
a mother &apos;s love for her children can be .
do i ever .
victoria , wait .
when can we see each other again ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
and what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a list of questions for the interviewer to ask .
oh , my news division has already handled this .
then i need your assurance that if anything goes wrong ,
you &apos;ll cut the live feed .
and what exactly do you expect to go wrong , victoria ?
or do we have an even bigger story than i thought ?
listen , i &apos;m happy for you to be there ,
but i won &apos;t tolerate any interference .
i &apos;m planning to tell nolan ross the same .
what does nolan have to do with this ?
david requested his presence .
let &apos;s go through this again .
he shot up .
shortly after realizing he took too much ,
he stumbled over here in an attempt to call 911 .
before he could , he collapsed ,
breaking his neck when he fell .
am i missing anything ?
i cut him with the bottle .
no .
when he fell , he swiped the counter .
bottle broke . cut his hand .
i can &apos;t imagine what it &apos;s like being you .
i mean , i know this was all my fault ,
but it was just a mistake .
i &apos;m not a cold @-@ blooded killer .
i &apos;ve never killed anyone , charlotte .
i know you hate me for the things that i &apos;ve done ,
but i &apos;ve never done that .
sadly , erasing every trace of myself is my expertise .
as your mother pointed out ,
it &apos;s something i &apos;ve done all too well ,
which is why i can &apos;t see our father yet .
i think you &apos;re just ashamed .
god forbid he sees what you &apos;ve become .
you know , for a while now ,
i &apos;ve given you the benefit of the doubt
because your parents did you no favors
by protecting you with lies .
but you &apos;re too old for excuses , charlotte .
it &apos;s time you own your bad choices .
that could easily have been you lying there .
you only called me
because you wanted someone to come and save you .
but i can &apos;t do that .
you &apos;ve hit rock bottom .
only you can pull yourself out .
aren &apos;t they gonna know that he died before he shot up ?
it &apos;s true .
drugs can &apos;t circulate once the heart stops .
but you don &apos;t need to be alive to circulate your blood .
aiden died of an overdose .
isn &apos;t that what the coroner said ?
but he didn &apos;t , did he ?
and you said you &apos;d never killed anyone .
i haven &apos;t .
your mother killed him .
looking good out there .
and your swing ain &apos;t bad , either .
oh , a few more weeks of practice ,
and i &apos;ll be able to whip to the head .
oh , hi , daniel .
oh ! what a small world .
my partner didn &apos;t show , and , lucky for me ,
your new client just joined the club .
i can see that .
you never told me how competitive this one is .
that &apos;s funny -- i thought i &apos;d told you all about margaux .
i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
i -- uh , you know , i had --
realtor was showing me some office space around the corner .
i thought i &apos;d stop by
and wish you luck for the interview tonight .
oh , yeah . i must be going .
i &apos;m meeting the crew early to go over details .
a pleasure , louise .
next time , winner buys lunch ?
deal .
bye .
bye .
that little accent of hers
is about the cutest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
what are you doing ?
didn &apos;t know i played tennis , did you ?
hundreds of members at this club ,
and you just happen to buddy up with my girlfriend ?
that &apos;s quite a coincidence , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
a completely innocent one .
i just signed up to be a sub , and she asked me to play .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you
knew my mother from a psychiatric hospital ?
well , i didn &apos;t think your mother would want me to share that .
come on .
people look at you differently when they know .
kind of like the way you &apos;re looking at me right now .
look , i &apos;m sorry if i seem a little paranoid .
it just wouldn &apos;t be the first time
i &apos;d been targeted by someone with a hidden agenda .
oh , quit being such a worrywart , sugar .
this has nothing to do with you .
all right , three minutes to air , everyone .
three minutes .
uh , poor timing , ems . can &apos;t talk right now .
i &apos;m upstate at the silo .
my hunch was right , nolan .
there &apos;s more to my father &apos;s story than he &apos;s admitting .
i have a photo of him in public .
like i said , not a good time .
he &apos;s in some kind of town square .
there &apos;s a bank sign behind him listing the date as march 15th ,
but that doesn &apos;t match up to his story
that he &apos;s been imprisoned until last week .
and for all you know ,
it was photoshopped by someone trying to make trouble .
cops still have this place on lockdown .
i need you to hack into their radio frequencies --
have dispatch draw them out with an emergency .
i &apos;m done investigating him , ems .
it &apos;s time to come to terms with the truth
instead of making up your own .
i &apos;m not making anything up , nolan ,
and i don &apos;t understand
why you &apos;re so unwilling to dig deeper .
because david has been through enough .
he &apos;s about to go on live tv , and ...
he needs my support .
wait . are you there with him ?
just because you &apos;re too afraid to reconnect with him
doesn &apos;t mean i have to be .
just , uh , playing hardball with a business partner .
ah . same , old nolan ross .
nolcorp may be a thing of the past ,
but the new company is probably right around the corner .
i do have a few things percolating .
no doubt .
david , we need you to take your seat .
glad you came . it means a lot .
thanks .
you two seem rather close as of late .
we &apos;ve always been close , victoria .
even when you left him to rot in prison ,
i was still there for him .
see , you may be able to keep david away from emily ,
but that &apos;s obviously not gonna work with me .
oh , well , i &apos;m not trying to keep him from anyone .
i simply don &apos;t want him to say something he might regret .
like what ?
what , are you afraid i told my new friend
what a wretched woman you really are ?
you two , you can take your places .
we &apos;re starting .
oh , i just love live tv .
you never know what &apos;s gonna happen .
okay , we are live in 30 seconds , people .
there . you &apos;re all set .
no matter what happens , i will always be on your side .
15 seconds .
mrs. grayson , we &apos;re gonna need you to move , please .
quiet , everyone . call it .
okay , in 5 , 4 , 3 ...
good evening .
we &apos;re here tonight to explore
one of the most controversial stories of our time .
david clarke , welcome .
that partner of yours is still at it .
hassling mo &apos;s grieving daughter with questions .
i give him two more minutes
before she throws that drink in his face .
so , no anger issues or anything that ,
that may have led to an altercation with one of the inmates ?
not that i know of .
hi . we haven &apos;t met . i &apos;m jack porter .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
ben and i never got to work with your father ,
but we heard great things .
isn &apos;t that right , partner ?
indeed .
yeah . my pop would have been real pleased
that so many guys from the precinct showed up today .
yeah , you know , denise was just telling me
how her dad won big in atlantic city ,
took an early retirement .
it was funny how news like that
didn &apos;t make its way back to the station , though ?
well , not really ,
considering he hadn &apos;t worked there in years .
pop wasn &apos;t one to brag .
and , besides , he was real busy the last few weeks
trying to sell the house .
excuse me .
come on . you tell me that doesn &apos;t sound suspicious ,
like he &apos;s trying to get out of town in a hurry .
we &apos;re at the man &apos;s wake .
exactly .
and there may be people in this room
who have answers that i need .
that may be true , but if you keep pursuing this ,
i &apos;m putting in for a new partner .
conrad grayson then imprisons you
in the basement of a silo for 10 years ,
cut off from the world .
what was it like in there ?
filthy , oppressive .
it was inhuman , is what it was .
i drank water from the same place that i bathed .
i slept on a small cot ,
that is , when i could sleep .
i spent over 4,000 days of my life down there ,
yet time , it seemed to stand still .
i needed it to so that i could maintain hope .
but it wasn &apos;t living .
it was survival .
the question on all of our minds is ,
how did you not give up ?
well , there were times when i thought about ending it all .
but then , the people who wronged me would have won ,
and i never would have had the chance
to see the people that i loved ,
one of whom is here today .
nolan , come join me .
david &apos;s exhausted .
this is too much for him . we need to end this .
this is exactly what
the audience wants to hear , victoria .
i know i do .
all right , well , it &apos;s public knowledge
that mr. clarke and entrepreneur nolan ross
were business associates years ago .
mr. ross , welcome .
nolan was like the son i never had .
and i knew his first company would be a success ,
and it was .
well , because you had the courage to invest in me .
an investment that paid off .
i figured the profits would provide
a nice nest egg for my daughter , amanda .
she never got the money , did she , nolan ?
of course she did . of course she did .
you lied to her , and you lied to me .
and you stole her inheritance .
i gave her all the money that she was owed .
what @-@ what she chose to do with it , i @-@ i ,
i obtained her financial records .
when she turned 18,
she was to receive hundreds of millions of dollars ,
but instead , she only got $ 100,000 .
that &apos;s quite a discrepancy , don &apos;t you think ?
david , please . this is not the place .
i trusted you .
i left the responsibility
of my daughter &apos;s future in your hands .
but while you were out buying custom cars
and your own private island , she was scraping by .
she worked as a stripper , for god &apos;s sakes .
she died without knowing that you &apos;d betrayed her ,
that you &apos;d betrayed me .
and for that , i will never forgive you .
mr. ross , can you address these allegations ?
not at this time .
margaux lemarchal .
margaux , hi . louise here .
i just wanted to call and tell you
how great the david clarke piece was .
i mean , really riveting stuff .
oh , thank you . very kind of you to call .
it was--
how did victoria feel about it ?
victoria grayson ?
i suppose she thought it went well .
well , we can talk more about it tomorrow .
that is , if you &apos;re still up for a rematch .
yes .
by the way , how did you know
i would be at the office so late ?
oh , i just took a shot .
you seem like one of those workaholic types .
anyway , see you tomorrow .
okay , bye .
your message sounded urgent .
is something wrong ?
i just wanted to say goodbye .
i don &apos;t understand .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m taking control of my own life .
i &apos;m checking myself into rehab .
oh , charlotte !
oh , that &apos;s wonderful !
i know some excellent facilities .
where do you think you &apos;ll be going ?
i &apos;d rather not say ,
since a large part of me doing this
has to do with me getting away from you and your lies .
david deserves to know the truth about emily .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
it &apos;s your lie .
i &apos;m just not gonna stick around to watch you tell it .
i &apos;m doing what &apos;s best for david .
would you stop ?
you &apos;re doing this to hurt emily .
charlotte , you know me .
i thought i did .
and then i found out you killed aiden .
and i know why you killed him --
because you blamed emily for pascal &apos;s death .
but he died because she was seeking the truth
about what you did to david .
i &apos;m sick of being caught
between you and emily and your cycle of hate .
i want out !
what i did to david all those years ago ...
all the things i have done ...
i have acted out of love ,
to keep our family together , charlotte .
family ?
look around you , mother .
this family you &apos;ve been working so hard to keep together --
you &apos;ve done nothing but tear us apart .
i love you , baby .
she died never knowing that you &apos;d betrayed her ,
that you &apos;d betrayed me .
for that , i will never forgive you .
mr. ross , can you address these allegations ?
not at this time .
yeah , you really need to start calling first .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , my money bought this house .
you &apos;re just the coward who lives in it .
how could you believe i would do something like that ...
to you , to amanda ?
you know me , david .
i thought i did .
the man i know wouldn &apos;t have stolen money from my daughter .
i didn &apos;t keep that money .
oh , yeah ? who &apos;d you give it to ?
i @-@ i -- i g-- i gave it to amanda !
but -- - but what ?
oh , she burned through $ 500 million
without leaving a paper trail ?
i want the truth , nolan .
yeah , so do i !
you said that you wanted me by your side ,
that you believed in me !
all an elaborate trap that you knew i would fall for
because i trust you like a father .
if i was your father , i would have done that a long time ago .
then you &apos;re more like him than i ever realized .
god .
are you okay ? what happened ?
your lies ... finally caught up to me .
looking for something ?
you scared the hell out of me .
i thought you &apos;d left .
and i figured you hadn &apos;t .
now you &apos;re breaking into mostrowski &apos;s garage ?
jack , look , if you had any idea
how many of these things didn &apos;t add up here ...
you really think that mostrowski had something to do with it ?
i studied that case file .
when mo was a suspect ,
they pulled his credit card and his phone records .
the guy hadn &apos;t left a five @-@ mile radius in two years .
he never told people that he won in atlantic city
because he didn &apos;t win .
that was just some story he told to his daughter
to explain a sudden windfall and early retirement .
yeah , mo was cleared of the murder ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that he didn &apos;t provide
an assist for someone who paid him off .
so what are you doing out here ?
denise told me her dad lived alone .
but i spoke with some of the neighbors ,
and they told me that they saw someone
coming and going from this garage
over the last several months .
so i &apos;m not leaving until i search this place .
you know what ? you make a strong case .
but like i said , we &apos;re partners , so ...
if you &apos;re not gonna give this up ,
i guess i &apos;m just gonna have to join you .
i &apos;m really proud of you , char .
what finally pushed you to make a change ?
our mother .
or , at least , the thought of me turning into our mother .
trust me . i get it .
every time i look in the mirror ,
i &apos;m terrified i &apos;ll see dad staring back .
but you &apos;re better than both of them . you know that , right ?
you are , too .
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;d be without you , daniel .
probably still listening to hilary duff and surfing myspace .
ouch . the truth hurts .
seriously , though ,
that &apos;s what big brothers are for , right ?
hey , you know ...
you never shied away from telling me the truth ,
even when everyone else was lying to me .
i love you for that .
that &apos;s true ,
and i &apos;d hate to leave on a lie .
there &apos;s something else i need to tell you .
it &apos;s about emily .
i just wanted to make sure that you were okay
after all that transpired .
come , sit .
i &apos;m sorry that i was distant this morning .
it was intentional .
i just couldn &apos;t risk involving you in my plan for nolan ,
should he ... decide to retaliate .
i see .
went over to see him this evening .
things got out of hand .
you were reacting on behalf of your child .
i know the feeling well .
no . it &apos;s more than that .
amanda &apos;s gone .
nolan was one of the few people from my old life ...
before it got ripped away .
now you &apos;re the only person left that connects me to my past .
i &apos;ll always be here for you , david .
always .
i hope you know that .
stay with me here tonight .
and every night .
i want nothing more .
i can &apos;t believe he did this to you .
he didn &apos;t .
you did because you &apos;re still keeping him in the dark .
wake up and smell the subtext , emily .
he thinks i stole money from amanda , ergo you ,
because he &apos;s still protecting the memory of you
because he loves you .
it &apos;s time to tell him .
i don &apos;t think we can .
why ?
not after what i discovered .
the guy that charlotte killed had this .
i convinced her that he was just another flight 197 fanatic .
yeah , but if he had been ,
he would have published this photo
so the world could see
that known @-@ terrorist david clarke was still alive .
who was this guy ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he was obviously following him for quite some time .
but why ? what is the connection ?
your field trip didn &apos;t provide any answers ?
sure did .
turns out , the place leaks like a sieve when it rains .
so , conrad &apos;s silo insurance doesn &apos;t cover roof repairs ?
there was rust on the sink , on the walls ,
everywhere you would imagine after 10 years ,
except on the legs of his bed ,
even though they were sitting in a puddle from the rain .
i think my father went to great lengths to stage this place ,
but he failed to take the rain into account .
so if it was staged --
you think he was never there at all ?
if he &apos;s lying about that ,
then he is lying about everything .
