stop where you are !
move away from the fence !
the use of deadly force is authorized .
this is your only warning .
morning .
morning .
you know what today is ?
no .
think back , one year ago .
vancouver .
i found you in that diner .
that feels like a lifetime ago .
you know , after we got home ,
those first few weeks were an adjustment .
not having to look over my shoulder anymore .
but slowly , life got back to normal , and ...
i started thinking about the future and ...
where we &apos;d be in a year .
i thought for certain ... we &apos;d be married .
hey , look , i made a promise to you .
i said you wouldn &apos;t lose me ,
and you haven &apos;t .
here i am .
everything is good , so ...
what &apos;s the problem ?
nothing . there &apos;s no problem .
everything is just so good right now .
i don &apos;t want it to change .
that &apos;s not it .
it &apos;s your father &apos;s company .
i &apos;m sorry ?
look , i know you &apos;ve worked so hard
to clean up the business ...
but there are still a few things
about it that i have a problem with .
kono , i ...
adam , just ...
look , it still has ties to the noshimuri clan ,
investors who were once connected to the yakuza .
up until a few months ago ,
wo fat had a stake in the company .
i had no knowledge of that .
look , i know that .
every day , i fight to keep our holdings legit ,
to make sure the business
doesn &apos;t go back to what it was .
okay , but still ,
the money that your father used to build the company ,
where that came from ...
adam , no matter what you do ,
it &apos;s a business that was born out of corruption .
and as long as you &apos;re tied to it ...
you want me to sell the company .
have i ever asked you to quit being a cop ?
every second of the day ,
i worry about you , but have i ever asked you
to give up your job ?
no .
but now you &apos;re asking me to give up mine .
kono , i am fighting
to change my family &apos;s legacy .
i walk away now , that will never happen .
and let &apos;s say i do sell , okay ? what then ?
wh @-@ what do you expect me to do with my life ?
look , i don &apos;t know , but we could figure it out .
yeah ... right . we &apos;ll figure it out .
like it &apos;s no big deal .
maybe you &apos;re not in a place you can hear me right now .
i should go .
so , the doctor says dekker &apos;s gonna pull through .
lucky , though .
close @-@ contact gsw to the gut .
not to mention the one he took trying to hop the fence ,
on top of the beating that he took .
all told , the guy suffered heavy blood loss ,
a little head trauma .
and when did this guy even get out of prison ?
three days ago .
apparently , his release was under a court order .
they kept it very quiet .
all right , thanks .
okay , so , hpd ran the car dekker was driving--
no vin number , plates were stolen ,
lab &apos;s processing it now .
all right , fine .
what about the slug from the first gsw-- we recover that ?
nothing . through @-@ and @-@ through .
all right , i don &apos;t get it . dekker still had six years left
on his sentence , now , all of a sudden , he &apos;s a free man ?
well , maybe he finally snitched his way out .
i think the bigger mystery
is why he was trying to get back in .
i &apos;ve heard of cons who want to go back to prison ,
but actually attempting to break in ?
no precedent for that .
i think we &apos;re about to get some answers .
hey , who is that ?
he &apos;s with ice--
he worked a homicide with us a few years back .
hey . commander .
agent morrison .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;ll live .
has he spoken yet ?
no . maybe you could tell us what &apos;s going on here .
all right , look , dekker &apos;s my ci .
we got him out of halawa to help us with a major operation .
lost contact last night ,
and we &apos;ve been looking for him ever since .
what was the op ?
we &apos;re after a high @-@ value target : roman zednick .
bulgarian . he &apos;s into everything
from narcotrafficking
and k &amp; r to assassination and piracy .
diversified .
this the best picture you got ?
this is the only picture that we got .
it was taken in madrid three weeks ago .
man obviously knows how to keep a low profile .
he excels at it .
hardly anyone has ever laid eyes on roman
up until recently we thought maybe he was just a myth .
劫匪携百万欧元潜逃
turns out he &apos;s been operating in the shadows for years ,
mainly in eastern europe .
he is bold , he is smart , he is ruthless ,
and from what we understand ,
he wants to plant his flag in the u.s.
we &apos;ll do whatever it takes to stop him .
how did dekker fit in ?
so , five days ago , we get intel that roman &apos;s
on the island and he wants to buy weapons .
soon as we heard that , we knew we had an opening .
great opportunity to get someone close to roman to i.d. him .
right , you just need a weapons broker .
exactly . so enter j.c. dekker .
we move as quickly as we can , we get him out of halawa
on a trumped @-@ up legal technicality ,
falsify the court records ,
create a paper trail that goes back for months .
soon as he &apos;s free , dekker used his contacts
to set up a one @-@ on @-@ one with roman .
we went to the meet last night , but we lost visual .
we believe that roman &apos;s people grabbed dekker
to take him to a second location to meet the man himself .
i can only assume that , at some point ,
dekker was compromised and they tried to take him out .
excuse me-- mr. dekker has regained consciousness .
i want to talk to him .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
the patient &apos;s a bit hostile at the moment .
i don &apos;t care-- i still want to speak with him .
well , the thing is , mr. dekker &apos;s insisting on only speaking
to members of the five @-@ 0 task force ,
no one else .
hey , before you even start in ,
straight up , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,
but i could tell you
i did not break out of halawa .
just relax , all right ?
we know all about ice .
ice ?
what are you talking about ?
look , i don &apos;t know what happened ,
but one minute i &apos;m working laundry ,
the next i &apos;m in here ,
and they tell me i got shot outside the prison .
wait a minute , the last thing you remember
is working laundry ?
yeah .
so you &apos;re saying that everything that happened
over the past three days-- roman ,
the guns , the op-- you don &apos;t remember any of that ?
three days ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
what op ?
who &apos;s roman ?
what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
the one guy who can i.d. our number @-@ one most wanted ,
and he says he can &apos;t remember ?
steve , do you believe him ?
well , the doctors told chin and i
that based on the head trauma dekker sustained ,
this type of amnesia is possible .
but we &apos;re talking about j.c. dekker here .
this guy &apos;s been lying to the cops
since before he could dress himself .
you &apos;re thinking this is a ploy ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
how do we know he &apos;s not working an angle ?
what if he doesn &apos;t want to say what happened
because he &apos;s afraid of roman ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean ,
the last time we talked to dekker ,
he seemed like a changed man .
plus , the amnesia would explain
him trying to break back into halawa .
yeah , he &apos;s confused , disoriented .
he doesn &apos;t know why he &apos;s not locked up .
well , here &apos;s the bad news :
there is no test to determine if you really have amnesia ,
so we got no way of knowing if the guy &apos;s telling the truth .
what about a polygraph ?
we could try , but i &apos;m afraid the meds in dekker &apos;s system
would skew the results .
however , there may actually be another way .
afternoon .
how we feeling ?
i &apos;ve been shot .
twice .
how you think i feel ?
all right , look right here .
all right , i &apos;m gonna ask you some questions .
okay .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember before you were shot ?
it &apos;s adam .
not much .
not gonna answer it ?
no .
tell me your name .
j.c. dekker .
you really don &apos;t know who i am , do you ?
aren &apos;t you my doctor ?
i looked right into his eyes and he didn &apos;t recognize me .
eight months .
eight ...
months i have been hunting roman .
no one has ever gotten this close to him , not that i have .
he &apos;s going back under , and probably for good .
maybe there &apos;s a chance
to catch him before that happens , all right ?
we work together , we retrace dekker &apos;s steps ,
maybe it leads us to roman .
i hate to throw cold water ,
but if we &apos;re going after this guy roman ,
we got to move fast .
if dekker did see roman ,
he &apos;s gonna get the hell out of dodge .
absolutely . there &apos;s no question that roman
is already making plans to get off the island .
we need to delay him .
okay . how ?
we kill dekker .
we put a story out there saying we found dekker murdered ,
no suspects , no leads .
if roman doesn &apos;t think he &apos;s been compromised ,
there &apos;s no reason for him to go underground .
he &apos;s here to do business , right ?
he &apos;ll do his business , and just get his guns someplace else .
right . then we keep him in play
long enough to find him .
that &apos;s right .
all right , i &apos;ll have hpd issue a bulletin on dekker .
we need to clear this wing out , as well .
even though there &apos;s security up here ,
there &apos;s a lot of foot traffic .
less people that see dekker , the better .
there &apos;s another prison ward at king &apos;s medical .
we can have the guards transfer everyone there .
yeah , i can get a guy down here to handle security .
oh , that &apos;s good . listen , kono ,
i want you to stay here , too .
stay with dekker , all right ? work with him .
see if you can help him remember the last 24 hours .
ok .
you and me-- we &apos;re gonna go see dekker &apos;s boy--
the one who he reached out to to put him in contact with roman .
that would be a gentleman by the name of odell martin .
all right . you know where to find him ?
yup .
what &apos;s dekker &apos;s connection to this guy ?
they used to surf dawn patrol together .
before that , odell was a player back in new york .
bookmaking , cigarettes , weed .
comes out here ten years ago to go legit .
dekker says he &apos;s still got his ear to the ground ,
knows a lot of underworld types .
thanks , bro .
take care .
odell martin ?
he is me .
agent morrison .
i &apos;m with ice .
commander mcgarrett , five @-@ 0 .
we need a word .
it &apos;s gonna have to be a quick one .
breaks just hit four feet overhead .
anything over two , i close up for the day .
i &apos;m pretty sure you can spare us a couple of minutes .
ocean &apos;s not going anywhere .
what can i do for you two fine public servants ?
we want to ask you about j.c. dekker .
j.c. dekker ? i don &apos;t know no j.c. dekker .
well , that &apos;s a strong reaction for a guy
you don &apos;t know .
odell , we ...
odell ?
what just happened ?
i was saying a prayer to kanaloa .
god of the ocean .
what happened ?
that &apos;s what we want to find out .
we think roman zednick is involved .
yeah , see , we know that dekker wanted to sell
roman some weapons , and we also know
that you made an introduction ,
so , we &apos;re kind of hoping you can tell us where he is .
get in the chair .
can &apos;t have people looking in here thinking i &apos;m a snitch .
you sit in the chair ,
you get a trim , you look like a customer .
don &apos;t worry . i got lots of experience .
yeah , i bet .
hey , don &apos;t touch my sideburns .
of course not .
okay . i &apos;m serious .
okay , look ,
i don &apos;t know how to get to roman , all right ?
i &apos;m connected , but i ain &apos;t that connected .
and roman , you know , you don &apos;t reach out to him .
he reaches out to you .
well , then , how did you put dekker in business with him ?
you guys know sidney ames ?
no , i don &apos;t .
you know him ?
no .
okay , how do i explain this ?
think of him like a concierge for criminals , right ?
you &apos;re a bad guy , you come to town ,
ames can hook you up
with whatever you need--
weapons , muscle , safe house , body disposal .
man &apos;s got the island wired .
he &apos;s the go @-@ to guy for all your illicit needs .
so , word is , roman &apos;s using ames
to help him to do business while he &apos;s on oahu .
all right , so you tell ames you got this guy dekker
who &apos;s looking to move a little hardware .
right , and ames said he just happened to have a client
who was in the market for a little firepower ,
so i told ames where to find dekks ,
and that was that .
where do we find ames ?
wait a couple of weeks ,
he &apos;ll be sitting in this very chair .
comes in once a month for a cut and a shave .
likes the number @-@ four clippers , a little brylcreem .
old school .
what if we don &apos;t have a couple of weeks ?
can &apos;t help you out then .
i don &apos;t keep no rolodex ,
ames only pays with cash , so ...
if it &apos;s gonna help you find out who killed dekks ,
i &apos;ll ask around .
that &apos;ll be ten bucks .
this is a legitimate transaction . you understand ?
ten bucks .
keep up appearances .
getting fleeced here .
yeah , should arrest you for that .
here you go .
keep the change , huh ?
i just ran ames .
he &apos;s a slippery son of a bitch .
the guy &apos;s been arrested three times , never charged .
current whereabouts , unknown .
last known address we had for the guy
turned out to be a vacant house .
what about financials ?
nothing .
running his last known associates .
hopefully , one of &apos; em will be able
to tell us where to find this guy .
in the meantime , have kono show dekker a picture of ames .
all right ? maybe we can help jog his memory .
you said his name was ames ?
we think he facilitated your introduction to roman .
inside .
you want to meet roman , get in .
i understand you have some weapons to sell .
man &apos;s voice was definitely not from around here .
mainland ?
europe .
okay . what about his face ?
trying to picture him .
trying to , but ...
it &apos;s just bits and pieces .
you think i wouldn &apos;t find out ? !
you played us !
it &apos;s all i remember .
okay , so , a faceless man with a foreign accent
in a big house by the water .
it &apos;s a start , right ?
so , you said earlier , you &apos;ve been after roman
for the last eight months .
you spend that whole time overseas ?
yeah , most of it .
can &apos;t have been easy .
no . but ...
certainly harder on my wife .
wrangling two kids by herself .
it was almost like she was a single parent .
speaking of single parents ,
i haven &apos;t seen detective williams at all .
oh , yeah , danny &apos;s on a plane to newark at the moment .
an old case he worked came up for appeal ,
he had to go back and testify .
yeah , chin , what do you got ?
the lab just finished processing the car that dekker was in .
they found fresh dirt on the tires
with traces of arsenic , lead and methyl chloride .
and , apparently , there &apos;s only one place
that has those specific toxins in the soil ,
and that &apos;s the old municipal ash dump on sand island .
so that was the last place dekker was
before he showed up at halawa ?
that &apos;s right . considering how remote that location is ,
there &apos;s only one reason why they &apos;d be out there .
they took him out there to kill him .
my guys did a grid search .
turned up a couple of shell casings ,
but this was the real discovery .
guess we can stop looking for sidney ames .
all right , so , looks like he was shot at close range .
defensive wounds on the hands , two sets of footprints .
i &apos;m guessing ames brought dekker here to kill him .
dekker flipped the script ,
they struggled .
still got shot , but he managed to get the gun away , and then ,
dekker-- he turns around and kills ames .
dekker fell on these rocks .
that would explain his head trauma .
listen , duke , we &apos;re gonna need to keep this quiet ,
what happened here .
he &apos;s right . word gets out that ames is dead ,
roman &apos;s gonna assume that dekker got away .
well , we got another problem now , though .
this was the only guy who could lead us to roman .
unless ...
here we go . we can have the service provider
pull csli on the phone &apos;s location history .
once we do that , we can get a fix on the house
where dekker met roman .
we know who lives here ?
no one .
it &apos;s a rental that goes for 60k a month .
according to the company who manages it ,
the people inside booked it for a week and paid cash upfront .
okay , guys ,
we &apos;re live .
i count five heat signatures in the house
- two on the ground floor .
looks like we &apos;re about to get a peek at one of them .
all right , let &apos;s move .
i got next game .
keep your hands where we can see &apos; em , get on the floor .
do it slowly .
got three tangos down .
copy .
find the other two .
please ... help me .
chin , call ems .
this is lieutenant chin ho kelly .
i need an ambulance at 2121 kahaleo avenue .
what &apos;s your name ? what are you doing here ?
danielle .
nicolai invited me .
lindsey , my girlfriend and i--
we met him last night in chinatown in a club .
okay . where &apos;s lindsey now ?
she @-@ she ... she left .
she ... she had a plane to catch .
am i going to be okay ?
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you &apos;re gonna be ... you &apos;re gonna be fine .
your gun and radio .
eyes forward .
there is no way out of here .
oh , i disagree .
you are going to get me out , agent morrison .
how do you know my name ?
you &apos;ve been after me for some time .
you think i don &apos;t make it a priority to know who &apos;s after me ?
now , here &apos;s how this will go .
you &apos;re going to get on this radio and tell your colleagues
that you saw me running towards the water .
right .
and that &apos;s not gonna happen .
and ... if you shoot me ,
they are gonna hear it , and they &apos;ll come after you .
it will happen .
because if you don &apos;t do as i say ,
your wife and two children are dead .
don &apos;t believe me ?
you live at 2476 kalawao street .
at this moment , i have a man outside your house
with eyes on your family .
call in the report and save them .
i have visual on an armed man heading to the beach .
all right , i got this .
i think it &apos;s roman .
well done ... agent morrison .
this is captain grover .
i need a full protection unit at 2476 kalawao street .
all notification is to go through either me or commander mcgarrett .
mahalo .
listen , your wife and your kids are fine ; they &apos;re safe .
they weren &apos;t even at home .
roman was bluffing .
yeah , but we &apos;re gonna have hpd sit on your house
until this thing &apos;s over .
you played this thing exactly the way you should &apos;ve .
yeah .
um , that &apos;s nicolai , nicolai krause .
and the other two were vicktor and julian .
but i didn &apos;t get their last names .
all right , what about the fourth guy in the house ,
the one who got away ?
gatsby .
gatsby ? that &apos;s what he called himself ?
no , that &apos;s what lindsey called him .
they never told us his name .
she just called him gatsby because he stayed out of sight
while we all partied .
well , you never saw him ?
no . uh , except for a few moments last night .
i went for a quick swim .
and when i got out ,
there he was .
did you see his face ?
yeah , i guess .
we &apos;re gonna transfer you to a secure wing in the hospital ,
then i &apos;m gonna set you up with a sketch artist there .
is that okay ? all right , good .
we should also have tsa track down that friend of hers .
give kono a heads up .
if danielle saw roman &apos;s face ,
that &apos;s motive for him to go after her .
aloha . good afternoon , sir .
welcome to the moana surfrider ,
a westin resort and spa .
please have this validated .
thank you . mahalo .
hey , jerry .
aloha , dude .
thanks for meeting me here .
no trubs .
fortunately , my schedule was light today .
what &apos;s up ?
kono once mentioned you had a friend who worked
at leonard &apos;s bakery . is that right ?
zak . he &apos;s practically &apos; ohana . why ?
they make this macadamia nut malasada that kono loves .
i want to get her a box .
but the thing is they only make it once a year .
do you think it &apos;s possible to get your @-@ your friend to ...
do a special order ?
yeah , i could probably make that happen .
mahalo , jerry .
you okay ?
yeah . you know ...
kono and i had a ... pretty big argument this morning ,
and i just ...
peace offering .
enough said .
but you know you &apos;re getting off easy .
most women would cost you a diamond bracelet ,
but not kono .
yeah , that kind of stuff doesn &apos;t matter to kono , you know ?
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s all about the simple things .
that &apos;s what i love about her .
no , no , no , no .
put your money away .
just let me take that hot little number for a spin sometime .
no , not kono . your ferrari .
of course . right .
thanks , man .
he had less hair than that .
so , danielle &apos;s sketch
is now out to hpd and tsa .
this guy roman might be smart ,
but he ain &apos;t gonna be able to hide in plain sight anymore .
actually , i might have a way to make him come to us .
ames &apos;s cell phone just got a text
from an unidentified caller .
&quot; five @-@ 0 raided house .
need immediate exfil off the island . &quot;
it &apos;s got to be roman .
he doesn &apos;t know ames is dead .
so why don &apos;t we have ames text him back ,
set up a meet .
look , i &apos;m just saying , i mean ,
i don &apos;t know what the drama was all about ,
but the guy feels terrible .
and i don &apos;t really know adam ,
but i could tell he &apos;s been beating himself up .
so what do you think ? could you forgive him ?
well , there &apos;s nothing really to forgive .
i mean , uh , we had an argument . couples argue .
oh . so you guys are cool now ?
well , it &apos;s not that simple .
okay . well , whatever it is , i hope you guys work it out .
i think adam &apos;s a real keeper .
you just said you didn &apos;t know the guy very well .
i know he &apos;s got big bucks , great hair , and an awesome car .
full disclosure :
i kind of have a little man crush on the guy .
ooh . i got to get to work . time to spin the sign .
oh , yeah . hey , i heard about your new job .
how &apos;s that going ?
it &apos;s great .
added a few new moves to the repertoire .
sidearm toss . rowboat .
i &apos;m really crushing this whole human directional gig .
it &apos;s an industry term .
right . well , i &apos;m glad it &apos;s going really well for you .
one for the road ?
i really shouldn &apos;t .
yeah , you should .
i do burn some serious calories doing what i do .
mahalo .
hey , nice to meet you , dude .
you look good for a dead man .
that guy works for five @-@ 0 ?
what is he , your mascot ?
he doesn &apos;t really have a title .
well , your boyfriend sounds like a decent guy .
how long you been with him ?
three years .
three years ? and you &apos;re not hitched ?
we &apos;re , um ... you know , we &apos;re working things out .
so , three ? what &apos;s the holdup ?
what , are we girlfriends ?
look , i &apos;m not discussing this with you .
ah , well , he sounds crazy about you ,
so ... i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re the problem .
you &apos;re the one who can &apos;t commit .
what &apos;s that all about ?
look , there &apos;s just an issue , okay ?
and i &apos;m not sure i can get past it .
look , i &apos;m not gonna cross @-@ examine you .
but can i say one more thing ?
no .
look , what you &apos;re doing , it ain &apos;t cool .
if you can &apos;t commit by now ,
you need to be fair to the guy and cut him loose .
don &apos;t be stringing him along .
okay , look , i &apos;m gonna go downstairs and get a coffee .
you want one ?
no . i &apos;m gonna do another lap .
okay . don &apos;t overdo it .
yes , doctor .
i don &apos;t like this .
roman chose the spot .
we don &apos;t have a choice .
i got something .
east side of the park . gray jacket .
it could be him .
yeah , i got him .
it &apos;s him .
move out .
roman zednick ! freeze !
five @-@ o !
everybody down !
move your hands out of your pockets nice and slow .
put &apos; em behind your head .
slowly !
all right , so here &apos;s the i.d. we took off roman .
it looks like he &apos;s using the alias emil hossa .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s one you haven &apos;t heard before .
no , but i &apos;m hoping once we dig into it ,
we &apos;ll get some intel on roman &apos;s network .
excuse me , commander ,
but this guy says he needs to speak with you .
down , poochie .
marcus , what &apos;s with the dog ?
he &apos;s cross @-@ trained in explosives and narcotics .
and while we didn &apos;t find either on him ,
i suspect he may have had some pakalolo in his pocket at some point .
what ?
relax .
okay , i got him . thanks , marcus .
five @-@ o batcave , huh ?
guys , meet , uh , odell martin .
howzit , fellas ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i hear you boys
took down some big target this afternoon , huh ? that right ?
where &apos;d you hear that ?
i got my sources .
so ... is that true ?
you guys bag roman ?
we are confirming ,
but , yeah , it looks that way .
and let me guess , he was using the name ...
emil hossa .
okay . hey , wait a minute .
seriously , where are you getting your information ?
that &apos;s not important .
what is important is that you guys know
that there &apos;s chatter going around that roman &apos;s using a decoy .
and the decoy &apos;s name ...
is emil hossa .
so you &apos;re telling us the guy we took down ain &apos;t roman .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
so where the hell &apos;s the real roman ?
we got a deal or not ?
i said i &apos;ll consider it .
i want to talk to who &apos;s in charge .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i done enough deals to know
that you &apos;re not the one callin &apos; the shots .
you &apos;re not roman .
you &apos;re right , mr. dekker .
he &apos;s not roman .
i am .
afternoon , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m agent corin with ice .
i &apos;m here to take you home .
she &apos;s here !
roman is here !
what ?
she &apos;s on this floor !
get in !
get back ! get back !
hurry .
all right .
you have to come down .
she must have crashed the entire wing .
what ?
the hospital &apos;s prison section has its own security system .
if a lockdown is triggered ,
then all the entrances and exits automatically lock .
so we &apos;re trapped ?
yeah .
and now that we know who she really is ,
roman &apos;s not gonna let us out of here alive .
come on . we got to get moving .
let &apos;s go .
those were the guys from the house ,
and according to the paper interpol has on &apos; em ,
they &apos;re all low @-@ level-- neither one of them could be roman .
okay , thanks .
that was strange . just got off the phone with tsa .
danielle &apos;s friend lindsey--
turns out no one with that name boarded any plane today .
where &apos;s lindsey now ?
she left . she had a plane to catch .
why would danielle lie to us ?
because this whole thing was an act .
she wasn &apos;t an innocent bystander , she is roman .
think about it--
a bullet comes through the wall , she gets hurt ,
she knows she &apos;s not going anywhere .
so she pretends to be some party girl .
kono &apos;s not picking up her phone .
the agent we sent over there isn &apos;t responding either .
okay , here ... here ...
there .
okay , look ,
i &apos;m gonna need to leave you here ,
try to get word to the outside .
phones are dead .
your cell &apos;s useless .
what &apos;s your plan-- smoke signals ?
if there &apos;s an o.r. on this floor ,
it should have its own generator and a videoconferencing system .
hey , come on .
look , it &apos;s on the other side , but i think i can do it .
how you gonna get past roman ?
连接失败
unit charging .
unit charging .
unit charging .
the unit is charged .
hey , you okay ?
she &apos;s back there .
no , no , here . i got him .
so i guess you didn &apos;t need the cavalry , huh ?
sister &apos;s bad @-@ ass .
you don &apos;t have to tell us that .
i want to consider all offers .
explore every option .
if this needs to be done piecemeal ,
one subsidiary at a time ,
i &apos;m willing to look at that .
you &apos;re serious about this ?
yes , i am .
excuse me .
oh , my god .
hey . kono , you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
i look worse than i feel .
come here .
what happened ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
what matters is ...
i love you .
and i can &apos;t imagine my life without you .
i want to be your wife , adam .
really ?
