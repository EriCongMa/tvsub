Hey! What the hell?!
No! What are you -- leave me alone!
Looks like uncle Silvio's third wedding in here.
You're just in time. Dinner is due any second.
Guess where from.
I'm guessing it's not the pizza and beer I was hoping for.
Le petit Maison.
They have the best escargot in Boston.
Snails?
Escar-gross.
Think of it as a garlic and butter delivery system.
Since when did you start liking fancy French food?
I don't know if I like it or not.
I just, uh, wanted to thank Maura for all her generosity
over these last couple of years.
So this is your fault.
If you mean introducing a refined cuisine
to a curious palate, then yes, I'm guilty as charged.
I think it's wonderful that Angela's expanding her horizon.
Yeah. I'm free, I'm single, I got a new job,
and it's time I started to live it up a little.
Don't worry, Jane.
I'm making more money now than I ever did.
And I got three new credit cards this week.
Yes, but, mom, you do realize that you have to
pay those off with real money, right?
Here you go.
What is it? It's...blackberry,
with a hint of...
coffee bean.
That was not the backup I was looking for.
I have a weakness for a good bordeaux.
Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles.
Come on!
We'll be right there.
We -- I-I'm sorry. Ma, we can take it to go.
No, no, no, no, no.
Escargot does not travel, but it does reheat.
Thank you, Angela.
Thanks, ma.
Angela, party for one,
your table is ready.
Ma's been spending like crazy ever since she got that job.
If she doesn't knock it off, she's gonna end up bankrupt
or living on the street.
Or even worse, with me.
All Angela needs is a good financial system
to manage her new income.
Well, can you talk to her about that?
The only financial system I use is to carry cash...
and a gun.
I can give her some pointers if you think it will help.
Yes, please. Hey, what do we got?
Uh, the victim is Dylan Blyer.
He and his wife own Mamaki Clothing.
They design and sell socially conscious clothes,
whatever that means.
It's an emphasis on global responsibility.
You know, paying a living wage to workers
and utilizing sustainable materials.
Could be that they are importing their cotton
from villages in Africa, which helps the
locals support themselves,
Stopping the cycle of poverty.
Well, his employees couldn't say enough good things about him.
Got along with everyone,
no conflicts, no personal issues.
Plus, he was a real visionary.
Committed to the business and to helping people.
Well, how did such a nice guy end up like this?
Well, the sales guy said that he heard an argument upstairs,
and then Dylan fell off the ledge.
There's blood-stained foam from the nose and the lips.
The skin has a bluish-gray tint.
That wasn't caused by the fall.
Looks like somebody searched through the desk.
Well, the store was locked
and there was no sign of forced entry.
But a neighbor did notice a panel van speeding away
around the time of death.
They get a plate?
Only a partial.
I put out a B.O.L.O.
Have C.S.R.U. check the computer,
see if any files were downloaded.
All right, so what do we think we're looking at here?
The -- the owner comes back unexpectedly,
finds somebody searching his office?
Burglary gone bad?
Yeah, but the burglar wasn't looking for cash.
He took some files, possibly searched the computer.
Corporate espionage.
Let's find out everything we can about the company --
who works here, how much money they make.
See if anybody has any secrets worth stealing.
I haven't been able to contact Zoe Blyer.
The victim's wife?
Yeah. I left messages on her cell numbers and home numbers.
Had uniforms stop by their apartment. Nothing.
So one owner of the company is dead,
And the other owner is missing.
I'll have Frankie go to the office,
ask around, see if anybody knows where we might find her.
I'm not supposed to say anything, but...
I heard he failed his firearms qualifications test.
My Frankie? That's impossible.
Evidently not.
No, he's -- he's a great shot. I taught him myself.
Maybe he needs a refresher.
He's only got two more chances to pass
or he'll get suspended.
Additional subendocardial hemorrhages
in the left ventricle.
I thought you'd want to know right away.
The fall didn't kill Dylan Blyer.
Okay.
Actual cause of death was poisoning.
No needle marks, so it's likely he ingested it.
Any idea what it was?
It's from the phenethylamine family.
But I've never seen this exact combination.
We'll know soon, though.
Yes, we will!
Is the phen-ethel merman fairy gonna tell you?
I'm afraid not, but it is the perfect test run
for our bio-orbitron MS-8000 mass spectrometer.
It's being delivered today.
It is the most advanced chemical analyzer in the world.
Ultrahigh resolution.
Recombinant glycoprotein characterizations.
Oh, my gosh.
Remember when you girls got that new D.N.A. splicer
and you talked about it for weeks?
This is even more boring than that!
Hey, Jane. We just got a hit off the B.O.L.O. for that van.
Okay.
Have fun with your new toy.
Looks like the right van. But a plumbing company?
I don't know about that.
You smell that?
Yeah. Yeah, it's coming from inside.
Zoe Blyer's still missing.
Hey! Get the hell outta there!
Put your hands in the air. Boston P.D.
Don't shoot.
What's in the bags?
Garbage.
You can't arrest me for picking up garbage.
If it's outside, I can take it. It's totally legal.
Yeah, I'm sure there's something in those bags
we can arrest you for.
This van was seen fleeing a crime scene last night.
Yeah.
I.D.?
Yeah, I'm going for my I.D. Don't shoot.
What were you doing there?
Making our lives harder.
Oh, good. He's a P.I.
We found the contents of Dylan Blyer's desk in your van.
Right. It's part of my investigation.
Well, ours, too,
Since it seems like you were there when he died.
Fine. I was there, but I had nothing to do with it.
He came in acting all crazy,
Like he was tripping on something.
Then he started screaming at me.
He stumbled backwards, went over the rail.
And -- and I tried to grab him, but he just went over.
No, no, that's -- that's a nice story.
What about this?
Blyer surprised you in his office.
He threatened to call the cops,
and you pushed him over rail to shut him up.
I like my story better 'cause it's what happened.
Look, I swear.
I didn't touch the guy.
You've been following him for the past two weeks.
Who hired you?
I don't give up my clients. Confidentiality issues.
You know that privilege doesn't extend to P.I.s.
So if you'd like to add obstruction to your --
Blyer's wife.
Why'd she hire you?
She thought he was having an affair.
Was he?
It seemed like it.
I mean, he was acting all kinds of shady --
Sneaking around, lying about where he was going.
Did you ever see him with another woman?
I wish.
Do you know the bonus I get for a money shot like that?
Divorce attorneys love me.
And the more naked, the better.
No.
I didn't. That's why I was in his office.
I-I was having no luck trailing him.
I mean, he eats at the same vegan restaurant for lunch,
And he goes to the same yoga place every afternoon.
And I had to find something.
You know, e-mail, a love letter.
Which is why I visited his office.
Which is why you broke into his office.
Well, the client gave me the key, so...
Technically, it's a gray area.
When's the last time you spoke to Zoe?
Last night.
I called her to tell her Dylan was dead.
She seem surprised?
Now that you mention it,
not so much.
C.S.R.U. finished processing the van.
They brought everything that P.I. gathered
into the conference room.
Well, not the garbage, just everything that was relevant.
All right, well, Jerry Jankowski's client
was Zoe Blyer.
She thought Dylan was having an affair.
Well, he might not have been as squeaky-lean
as his employees thought.
Yeah, neither was she.
She had two drug convictions when she was younger.
Well, maybe it's not about the business after all.
Jealousy's a powerful motive.
And she hasn't been seen or heard from since he died.
Nothing on her A.T.M. or credit cards?
No, and she hasn't used her cell phone.
All right, I'll put out an A.P.B.,
and I'll have Frankie go through the P.I.'s stuff
to see if we can place Zoe and Dylan together
on the day of the murder.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Frankie's down at the firing range practicing,
And from what I hear, he needs it.
Did jane put you up to this?
She only wants to help.
I can handle my own money... just fine.
Of course. Of course. But with income from the new job,
it might help to just establish some rules for yourself.
Rules?
Like...
Practicing restraint.
Not splurging on expensive items.
And I have a few strategies of my own I can share with you.
Do any of these "Strategies"
have to do with what's in your "Study closet"?
Study closet?
I'm not sure I understand.
Oh, you understand perfectly well.
Maybe there's a chapter in here that deals with splurging.
Or not splurging, as the case may be.
I know talking about money is difficult,
but it is also important.
I have customers.
So do I.
Well, bodies.
I'll see you at home.
And we can talk about this then.
Or not. We can see how we feel.
Hey, that was better.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How's my grip?
Look, try to just use the two middle fingers.
Okay? Like that. All right, now slowly...
Squeeze.
Good.
Keep practicing.
Will do!
You failed your shooting test on purpose?!
What? No way.
Well, either that or you're going blind,
which, from the way you were staring at her ass,
I can see is not the case.
It's no big deal. Okay?
I-I just needed a reason
to have a couple of lessons with the new firearms instructor.
Alexandra.
I mean, did you see her?
This is sad on so many levels.
What?
I'm gonna ace the next test. Don't worry.
Hey, I am just saying you're new to Boston,
and I could show you places
that you will not find in the guidebook.
Stop talking.
Oh, have you ever had razor clams?
You charge people for this nonsense?
"10:00 p.m. -- dirty abused Hobbits"?
It's a code.
"Dirty abused hobbits." D.A.H.
"Dylan arrives home."
You messing with me?
No. See, that way, they can't force me to testify.
Pretty smart, right?
You told detective Rizzoli
you called Zoe Blyer right after the murder.
I checked her cell records. No call from you.
I don't call my clients' cell phones.
I give 'em burner cells because they can't be traced.
Of course they can.
They can?
What's the number?
Um, okay.
Uh, first time I met her, Golden Szechuan Palace.
I got it.
You and me, our minds are like one.
Not even a little bit.
I'll run the number, let you know when we find her.
Am I right?
I'm at the address now.
The cell pinged from that location less than a half-hour ago.
Backup's on the way now.
Tell them she's on the move.
Zoe Blyer?
Hey. Boston police! I just wanna talk to you!
No!
No! Stay!
Stay away!
Drop your weapon!
Hold on! Hold your fire!
Zoe, now we just wanna talk to you about Dylan.
He's dead.
I know.
Put the gun down. We don't wanna hurt you.
No, no, they killed him.
Zoe, I wanna help you,
but you have to drop the gun.
Please.
Help me...
or they're gonna kill me, too.
All right.
Okay.
Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Who are you running from?
I don't know. Dylan warned me we were in danger.
From who?
He wouldn't say.
Come on, Zoe. We know that you hired a P.I.
because you thought that Dylan was having an affair.
Must've made you angry.
Sometimes we do crazy things when we're angry.
I was hurt, not angry.
Were you using again?
What? No.
I've been clean for seven years, thanks to Dylan.
I wouldn't have made it without him.
You think I killed him?
You tell us.
I would never hurt Dylan.
I was just confused.
He always talked to me about everything.
Then one day, he started shutting me out.
When was the last time you spoke with him?
The day he died.
He told me he was out of town on business.
The investigator e-mailed me pictures of him
at some cheap motel here in Boston.
I called him and I accused him of horrible things.
Who did you think he was having an affair with?
Our account Renee.
He'd been meeting with her a lot.
And he denied it?
He swore he wasn't cheating.
He told me he got mixed up with some dangerous people,
and the less I knew, the better.
But he had some kind of evidence
that would make everything right again.
Did he say what that was?
No.
Jerry called and told me Dylan was dead.
And I realized...
He'd been telling me the truth, and we really were in danger.
So you went into hiding.
I should've trusted him.
I should've believed in him like he always believed in me.
You look like someone just drowned your puppy.
I just... I failed my shooting test.
Again.
You know what?
You keep screwing around, you're gonna regret it.
That's the thing. I really tried this time.
It's Alexandra.
She was standing so close to me, I couldn't focus.
All I could think about was coming up with the perfect line
to ask her out.
How about, "The only thing I love more than a woman in uniform
is a woman out of uniform"? That's always a winner.
I'm serious. Tomorrow could be my last chance.
You have to come and -- and keep her away from me.
What?! No!
Yes.
Fine.
This is what you get for thinking with your...gun.
I understand you were the only account for Mamaki since it started?
That's right. I handle most of their financial affairs.
Dylan and Zoe are more visionaries than businesspeople.
Were there any issues?
Cash flow problems? Anything like that?
Not for a long time.
The first couple years were difficult,
but it's been going well for a while.
What turned things around?
Dylan's passion.
He believed in his company's mission,
and he made his investors believe in it, too.
Dylan visited your office several times last week.
How did you know that?
We have a source. About all I can say now.
A source.
I see.
Well, I came down here because I wanted to help,
but now I'm wondering if I should have an attorney present.
Our source is a private investigator.
Zoe Blyer hired him to follow Dylan
because she thought he might be having an affair.
With you, actually.
No. No.
Dylan would never cheat on Zoe.
He loved her.
And he's the most honest person I know.
If there weren't any problems, why so many visits?
He was considering an expansion into New York,
and I thought he might be moving too fast.
I still can't believe he's gone.
Well, we are doing everything we can to figure out what happened.
If you could provide the company's books,
that might be helpful.
Of course.
Dylan was amazing.
He didn't deserve this.
Hello, tall, shiny, and handsome.
And he doesn't leave the toilet seat up.
Jane rizzoli, I would like you to meet
Bio-orbitron ms-8000.
This things costs more than I make in a year, doesn't it?
It costs more than everyone makes in a year.
Speaking of, how'd the conversation go with my mom?
Not as well as I'd hoped.
Angela's by resistant to advice on financial matters.
She's resistant to everything. I'll talk to her.
No.
I mean, um, you know, who knows what she'll say?
She hasn't said anything to you, has she?
About what?
Well, about...I don't know. Um, investments or... closets.
Closets?
Never mind. Okay.
So I did a comprehensive analysis on the poison.
The reason wasn't able to identify it
is because it's from an entirely new synthetic hallucinogenic.
A drug? What, like l.S.D.?
It's more like similar to the newer designer drugs,
like M.D.M.A. and 2c-I, that are on the rave scene now.
So our victim oded?
Technically, yes.
He had a massive amount in his system --
six times the normal dosage level.
Well, that can't be accidental.
Well, how hard is it for somebody to give him that much?
Well, it's odorless, tasteless,
undetectable in food and drink.
I will be able to pinpoint the time he ingested it shortly.
I also remembered something.
There was a similar death
in Amherst a few months ago.
A student oded on an unidentified hallucinogenic drug.
So I ran the chemical analysis through the database
and found three other cases --
one in Providence
and two in Georgetown.
Wait a second. Can you pull up those crime scene photos?
Of course.
There. That one.
Zoom in on that.
Amherst, providence, and georgetown.
Mamaki sells their clothes
in every city where you found that drug.
You think the company is being used as a cover
for a distribution ring?
If it is,
then the people Dylan was involved with are drug dealers,
and whatever evidence he collected
may be what got him killed.
I talked to narcotics.
There's a new designer drug called viper
that's hit the college scene.
That may be the same drug that killed Dylan Blyer.
Have any idea who's behind it?
No, but Landry's gonna check with his C.I.S
and see what they know.
What'd you find at the motel?
Blyer requested the same room every time he stayed here.
Was he meeting drug connections there?
Manager said that he stayed alone and never had any visitors.
You know what? It -- it doesn't feel right,
him dealing in drugs. He hated drugs.
He kept his wife clean for years.
Look at this. This is the worst room in the place,
but it's got the best view of that.
Hey, Jane, are you with Nina?
Uh, yeah. Hang on a second.
Go ahead.
Hey, do you have any information on a Mamaki distribution warehouse?
We have a name -- Ward Logistics.
No address, though. Just a p.o. box.
Why? Did you find something?
I don't know. Let me get back to you.
Ugh. If I had to look at that many numbers every day,
I would just lay down and cry.
Do you see anything interesting?
Their accountant was right.
Mamaki had some committed investors.
Several substantial cash contributions
over the last few years, which is strange.
Strange is good.
Strange is our friend in a murder investigation.
The company wasn't profitable yet,
but they kept expanding anyway,
which made me wonder if maybe those investors
were interested in something else, like drugs.
So I pulled the filing papers on the investors,
and found out they all lead back
to one anonymous shell corp.
"Anonymous" Is not our friend.
We need a name.
On it.
Can I help you?
Boston P.D. We need to speak to the owner.
I'm Stanton Ward. Can I help you, detectives?
Stanton ward of Ward Logistics?
Yes.
Did you work with Dylan Blyer?
Oh, that's right. You must be looking into Dylan's death.
It's very upsetting.
Not just personally.
I mean, he was an exceptional young man,
But professionally, too.
Mamaki is my biggest client.
What did you do for them exactly?
We're basically a clearinghouse for everything that comes into
or goes out of Mamaki.
They import their cotton from Africa.
When it arrives here,
we deliver it to the manufacturer who make the clothes.
The finished items come back here to be sorted and packaged,
and then distributed down to the stores.
Mr. Ward, when's the last time you saw Dylan?
A week or so ago.
He usually stops by a couple times a month.
So he wasn't in any time over the last few days?
Uh, it's been at least a week.
Did he seem concerned about anything?
Why? You got some reason to think that he wasn't happy?
Do you?
No.
Mind if we take a look around?
I run a top-notch operation.
We've passed every government inspection with flying colors,
and we've never been cited with a violation.
You can look anywhere you like, detectives.
We got nothing to hide.
Thank you.
You think Blyer was spying on his own distributor?
If he's as honest as everybody says he was,
it's possible he didn't know about the drugs.
Then somehow he finds out or he gets suspicious...
So he starts his own investigation...
Which leads him here.
He told Zoe he had evidence
that would make everything right.
We need to find what he found.
Let's get a warrant,
bring some drug dogs down here.
I love dogs.
Rizzoli.
Jane, I finished testing the drug.
Based on the dosage and the victim's B.M.I.,
I'd estimate the time of poisoning
to be about two hours prior to the time of death.
Of course, that's an approximation.
It's impossible to be exact
with a substance we know so little about.
Well, that's good enough. Thanks, Maura.
Detective Rizzoli! You don't realize
I am a vital part of an ongoing investigation!
What is going on here?
Why aren't you in your room?
That's what I told him.
I was looking for you.
Go to your room.
What am I, 6?
Go to your room this instant!
Well, I created a time line, if anybody cares.
It's fine. It's fine. I've got it.
You did this?
Why so shocked?
I am a professional just like you.
Please. You and I have nothing in common.
What is your problem with me?
I'm obviously really good at my job.
I'm sure you are.
It's the way you go about it I have a problem with.
I do what needs to be done.
Don't you do the same thing?
'Cause you seem pretty driven to me.
Yeah, but I don't make up the rules as I go along.
Okay? I believe in --
in right and wrong, in black and white,
not this gray area that you're so fond of, no.
I get that. You deal in murder.
Good guys and bad guys.
I deal in broken marriages
and cheapskate insurance companies.
Everybody thinks they are the good guy.
It's all one big gray area.
And sometimes,
I really don't like it myself.
You know, I was gonna be a cop when I was younger,
but sadly, that didn't work out.
Am I gonna regret asking why?
Well, I was obviously too good for them.
Look at that. You created an alibi for yourself.
Yeah. What? I did?
This time-stamped receipt with your signature on it.
We know now that Dylan was poisoned
two hours before he died.
Your time line indicates
that he was at his regular yoga class.
This receipt states that you were clear across town.
So...
You're free to go.
Yeah. Good.
Right.
Uh... but if you need me to stay here,
I can help you with this.
I think we can take it from here.
Well, can I get my stuff back?
No.
That's cool. That works for me.
Wait a second.
These pictures that you took of Dylan at the motel --
are you sure they're in the right order?
Definitely. I checked them twice.
This picture of him leaving the motel at night,
where'd he go?
I think he went for a walk.
I didn't leave the motel because I was hoping
the mystery lady was gonna show up,
and I did not wanna miss the money shot.
Here he leaves the motel with a travel mug.
But here, when he comes back 45 minutes later,
he doesn't have it.
Maybe he lost it?
No, no, no. I don't think so. Look...
5:15 the next morning, he leaves the motel empty-handed.
When he comes back, he's got the travel mug again.
So maybe he found it.
He didn't find it. He retrieved it.
The mug's a video camera. He was filming something.
Oh, we need to look at that right now.
I need to look at it right now.
You need to go home.
Jerry.
Nice job.
So you think Dylan Blyer snuck in at night
and placed a camera?
And then picked it up the next morning
so he could see what Ward had been up to.
Here we go.
Okay, fast-forward.
Can you zoom in?
There.
Looks like they're importing more than just cotton
from Africa.
That's Ward.
I'll give him this -- he's a good liar.
Well, you can't really make out what's in the packages.
No way to prove it's drugs.
We still got a unit sitting on him?
Yep.
Good.
I wanna make sure we can find him
when the dogs are finished with the warehouse.
We should just talk to my mom together.
You know, like a... financial intervention.
Look, why don't I just handle it?
'cause you and your mom just argue when you talk about money.
My mother and I argue when we talk about the weather.
You wanted to talk about spending?
Let's talk.
Well, there's nothing really to discuss.
Really?
And, uh...
when exactly were you planning on wearing this?
I don't know. Eventually.
Jackie O never goes out of style.
Where did all of this come from?
The study closet.
Must be some closet.
Yeah, the real question is,
why is it stuffed in there?
Sometimes...I shop.
This isn't shopping, Maura.
This is building inventory for your own store.
Or zoo.
Wally was more of a companion before Angela moved in.
Okay, you're dodging the question.
And scaring us.
When I'm stressed out, I like to shop.
It makes me feel better.
I like that everything is new, not dead.
But why are you hiding it?
Because I know I don't need a pillbox hat
or a giant giraffe.
I just...need some self-control.
It's okay to do something extravagant once in a while.
Ma, you know, maybe it's okay for Maura.
She's loaded.
You, on the other hand, you gotta be careful.
Why do you have such little faith in me?
Ma, I just worry, that's all.
You think I'm too dumb to manage my money?
Come on. No.
I... all right, fine.
When I first joined the force, I...
I went a little crazy and I racked up
thousands of dollars in credit card bills,
And it took me years to pay them off.
Well, why didn't you tell me? I would've helped you.
Oh, yeah, sure,
and let you know how badly I screwed? Not a chance.
There's no place to sit down.
I guess we all have a few financial skeletons in our closets.
I'll admit.
I did find this one a bit surprising.
Maura, it's a weapon.
It doesn't have to match your purse.
Jane, accessories always have to match.
Let me see it.
Nope.
Okay.
You find anything on Stanton Ward?
Not much. On paper, he's clean.
Owns several businesses, all legit.
No arrest record,
no connections to any known criminal organizations.
Search of his warehouse with drug dogs came up empty, too.
I did find one thing.
I was running comparisons on Ward's holdings
and the shell corp that invested in Mamaki.
Did you get a name?
Not for who's behind the shell corp,
but a tax return for one of Ward's companies
was filed by his C.P.A. -- Renee Levinson.
Did she tell you she worked
for both Dylan Blyer and Stanton Ward?
She most certainly did not.
There.
See? Look at you go with your girly gun.
Elegant, stylish,
and extremely effective.
You're right. This does help to relieve stress.
Right? So much better than shopping, huh?
It's...louder.
You know if you ever get stressed out about something,
you can just come talk to me.
I know. I...
Uh, sometimes I forget that
I don't have to solve all of my problems on my own.
Well, what's the fun of having friends if you can't
bitch and complain to them whenever you want to?
Oh, I thought the point was that we were supposed to
support each other through positive reinforcement.
Y-yeah, that. But the bitching and complaining is so much fun.
Okay, we gotta go save Frankie from his hormones.
What? That's why we're here.
I have to run interference.
Frankie's got the hots for the new firearms instructor.
He wants to ask her out.
Really? Alexandra?
Hey.
Hey!
Hi!
So nice to see you again, Alexandra.
You, too.
How are the wife and kids?
Oh, we're great, thanks. Julie's loving the new house.
Lots more room for the boys to play.
Oh. Well...
Seriously?
That was excellent.
I knew you could do it.
Good job, bud!
Hmm. Oh, I-I'm sure I mentioned it.
You didn't.
Well, yes...
I've occasionally done a little work
for Mr. Ward over the years.
What else didn't you tell us about?
I mean, what about these investors?
You had to know those were bogus.
All that cash being invested into Mamaki.
Stanton Ward was behind that, wasn't he?
I really wish that I could help,
but I'm just an accountant.
I-I do the books and -- and I offer advice occasionally,
but that's all.
You told me you handled most of Mamaki's business affairs.
Which is it, Renee?
I-I may have overstated my involvement before.
No, I don't think so.
I think you were involved up to your eyeballs
and now you're scared.
I think you need to take this.
Rizzoli.
Did you forget how to answer your phone?
Jerry?
Look, I'm being followed.
Look, I know that you wanna be a part of this, but--
Just turn on FaceTime! Hurry up!
See?
I told you I wasn't making it up!
Where are you?
Hey, hey, come on. You want some of this?!
Try and get a location.
Hey, guys, come on. Jane, help!
Jerry!
Help!
I really wish I could help.
Your buddy Ward just kidnapped a private investigator
that Zoe Blyer hired.
What?
You told Ward about him, didn't you?
I...
I promise you,
if anything happens to this guy,
and I find out that you didn't tell us everything you know,
you will go down for this.
We still have uniform with him, right?
I already called. He gave him the slip.
Where would Ward take him?
I don't know.
Look, Renee, I don't think you're a bad person,
but you're in a very bad situation
and you need to make it right.
I never knew about the drugs, I swear.
And-- and I begged Dylan not to confront Stanton.
Renee, think.
You know Ward's other businesses.
Is there anywhere else, anywhere where Ward would take him?
He owns a body shop. Um, the Fenway Collision Center.
It's not registered in his name.
I want those recordings.
Why do you think I have 'em?
'Cause my guys looked everywhere else.
And I know you're the last one
to see that bleeding heart Blyer alive.
I give it to you, you'll just kill me.
I'll kill you if you don't.
I hid 'em.
And if something happens to me,
it goes right to the cops.
I don't think you're that smart.
Not a sound.
Last chance before I start shooting holes in you.
Well, that seems a bit extreme.
Whatever happened to breaking fingers?
Let -- let's go old school.
God, I'm tired of your mouth.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
You know what your first mistake was?
You should've got the recording before you poisoned Blyer.
I mean, if I gotta be honest with you,
it's really an amateur move on your part.
I'm not an amateur. We followed Blyer.
We knew he took that same yoga class every day.
We put enough viper in his water bottle to kill a horse.
And I would've had all night to find those recordings
if you hadn't taken them.
Guess I really screwed things up for you, huh?
Well, do I have to have him sign the confession, too?
Boston Homicide. Put your hands in the air.
Who's the smart one now?
You all right?
Uh, I am a little banged up,
but it's not the first time.
Thanks for getting him to confess.
Yeah. I think we're a great team.
You know, Rizzoli & Jankowski.
No.
Thank you for finding me.
Any time.
Stay out of trouble, okay?
Uh, hey. I don't suppose there's a reward for this, right?
All right, forget about it.
Look, I'm just happy helping Boston's finest.
I don't know about P.I.s.
Never feel like I can trust them.
I don't know.
It's kind of a gray area.
Okay, this is the "return" pile,
and that is the "donation" pile.
And this is an "Angela" pile.
Okay, I thought we weren't gonna go crazy
with the foo-foo dinners anymore.
Yes, uh, but Angela had a point,
that every now and then,
we deserve to treat ourselves to something fancy.
You're taking her side now?
Stop worrying.
I cut up two of the credit cards,
and the one I kept, I'm gonna pay off every month.
You could stand a little crazy once in a while yourself.
Between my job and my family,
I got enough crazy for anybody.
Right, Wally?
Oh, no, Jane, you're taking it too far.
Do not make him take sides.
Okay, but, ma, you gotta promise that you won't --
Whoa! Is that risotto?
From Turturro's.
But don't feel like you have to eat it.
I mean, if it's too expensive for you...
Caprese! And...
Pesto gnocchi!
Yes.
I love pesto!
Well, it's-- it's like I always say--
What's-- what's the point in making money
if you're not gonna treat yourself, right?
I think you would get in a program.
Oh, no, no. Don't -- you can't eat it out of the plastic.
Why not?
Put it on a plate.
What?
Stop her. Stop her.
