i got you guys something .
we &apos;ll be friends forever .
you lost a dear friend .
you guys need to find a way to say goodbye together .
okay , so the town is gonna put in a new bench ,
and there &apos;s gonna be a pathway of art tiles .
she lives in this town . i have to see her ...
you think they &apos;re gonna work this out ?
i really don &apos;t know .
are you moving out ?
i was looking for mr. fitz .
he &apos;s not in .
i &apos;m his sub , miss shepard .
do you know if mr. fitz will be back tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t .
either you &apos;ve got some genius plan of sleeping with the enemy ,
or you &apos;ve lost your mind !
you don &apos;t even know him .
we &apos;ve all got secrets , emily .
toby and jenna had a relationship .
way beyond step @-@ siblings .
it &apos;s enough to want her dead .
and us .
so , is toby dead ?
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to ask .
i &apos;ve kept quiet about a lot , emily .
the least you can do is get me that file .
there . it &apos;s done , okay ?
i was afraid she wouldn &apos;t get it done in time for the memorial .
and this was someone from your mom &apos;s gallery ?
right .
where is your mom ?
there &apos;s an apartment above the gallery ,
so she &apos;s staying there .
for now .
that &apos;s kind of weird , isn &apos;t it ?
your mom moving out .
yeah , like my dad should have left .
that &apos;s what you &apos;d expect .
aria .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
the whole thing just ... sucks .
i know .
did anyone call shelly leonard ?
done . and i told her if she plays anything depressing ,
i will kick in her cello .
oh , what about the program ?
almost done , but we should finish it
before ali &apos;s brother gets here .
when is that ?
tonight . and he wants to see us in the morning .
you know what ? i barely remember jason .
we didn &apos;t know him .
he was just ali &apos;s older brother down the hall .
behind a closed door .
with his hardcore punk music vibrating the floorboards .
how did he get into an ivy league school ?
i don &apos;t know . it must have been affirmative action
for goths and emos .
wow . it &apos;s beautiful .
pedestal &apos;s already out there , next to the bench .
this goes up friday morning .
do you think jason will like it ?
of course he &apos;ll like it .
you know ... years from now ,
people are gonna see this memorial ,
and--and that &apos;s all they &apos;ll ever know about ali .
she &apos;ll be the girl that they dedicated the bench to .
and we &apos;ll all be gone , but ...
ali will still be remembered .
that &apos;s immortality , my darlings .
i wish we could just choose
the age that we wanted to be and ...
just stay there .
the only way to do that is to die young ,
leave a beautiful corpse .
don &apos;t joke .
it &apos;s not a joke .
oh , come on .
haven &apos;t you guys ever thought about
how deliciously tragic it would be
to die in some incredibly mysterious way ?
that would be superior .
is that really how you want to go , alison ?
not just yet .
don &apos;t talk like that .
it &apos;s gruesome .
it &apos;s not gruesome .
it &apos;s immortality , my darlings .
where did she get that from ? a movie ?
ali was a movie .
it was humiliating !
the store clerk just took my credit card away .
that &apos;s private property , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s private property . it belongs to the bank .
well , what about my other cards ?
don &apos;t be so quick on the draw ,
at least for a while .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was trying to keep this off your radar .
mom .
we have to make some adjustments .
temporary adjustments .
we need to be more careful about money .
for how long ?
until we don &apos;t have to anymore .
and how long is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , when will you know ?
this is a visual representation of what i &apos;m talking about .
skim milk , orange juice , and some yogurt .
no flavored waters , no cunning chardonnay .
nothing from the artisan cheese shop .
what happened ?
what happened is a mortgage ,
and bills , and taxes ,
and the fact that this is a one @-@ paycheck family ,
and we can &apos;t live a two @-@ paycheck life .
i thought i could compensate for your dad going ,
but it &apos;s been hard .
harder than i expected .
how hard ?
it &apos;s not the first card to be declined .
you &apos;ve done a great job .
really .
mom and dad and i are really grateful .
there she is !
jason !
sorry i &apos;m late .
no problem .
i was just saying you &apos;ve done some lovely work on the memorial .
i might have done one or two things differently ,
but we can adjust that along the way .
here &apos;s a copy of the program for the dedication .
i e @-@ mailed you the program that we worked up .
right . i saw the draft .
this just fine @-@ tunes it .
uh , let &apos;s see ...
if shelly leonard &apos;s gonna play something ,
i don &apos;t think we can give her more than three minutes .
i remember she &apos;s somewhat of a showboat with that cello .
then , uh ...
is this ...
the picture for the program ?
yes . it &apos;s everybody &apos;s favorite .
it &apos;s the one i would have picked .
i thought i was gonna be able
to get my whole family out here , but ...
you know , at the last minute ,
my mom , um ...
it &apos;s crazy talking about this , isn &apos;t it ?
when i think about her , i @-@ i think about you--
the five of you , in her bedroom , laughing ,
keeping secrets .
long time ago .
i want each of you to speak .
i &apos;d rather hear from you
than mrs. slocomb from the pta .
the pta was a lot of help .
what about the rain ?
the rain ?
forty percent chance before the weekend .
oh , um , they said that we can use
the school &apos;s multipurpose room
if we have to move the ceremony inside .
great .
people think this dedication is about closure .
there won &apos;t be closure until they find out
who did this to alison .
the cops in this town have been jerking my family around
for more than a year .
no more of that .
i &apos;m here to get some action ,
and this memorial is gonna help me get it .
oh , and i &apos;m adding
one speaker to the program .
jenna marshall ?
you want jenna to speak at the dedication ?
that &apos;s right .
why ?
she asked me if she could .
jenna asked to speak ?
is there a problem ?
i @-@ it just didn &apos;t occur to us
that alison and jenna were that close .
yeah , i didn &apos;t know either .
jenna called and ... said my sister was
a lot of help to her after her accident .
well , concentrate on what you &apos;re gonna say .
leave the rest of it to me .
now , i &apos;m going to have a talk with detective wilden .
and find out why they haven &apos;t located toby yet .
did we just get fired ?
shh ! keep it down !
why is he talking to jenna ?
i don &apos;t know .
what does she have to say ?
this is turning into a nightmare .
what else did he say ?
nothing . he just kept smiling like he was running for office .
spence , why does jenna want to speak at the dedication ?
why does jason want her there ?
i mean , he clearly knows they weren &apos;t friends .
we can &apos;t let jenna speak .
well , how are we gonna stop her
without looking like bitches ?
how are we going to stop her at all ?
in case you guys didn &apos;t notice ,
we just got patted on the head and sent off to play .
you know what ? you need to stay on top of him .
find out what &apos;s going on .
why me ?
because you &apos;re the big organizer .
you &apos;ve got the laptop of all knowledge ,
and he &apos;s gonna need some of that .
jenna could get up there ,
she could tell about the fire and toby .
she could tell about everything .
2010届返校节
ezra , wait !
just let me talk for a second , please .
i don &apos;t want to argue or try to convince you of anything .
i know it &apos;s over , i know that !
but--i just , i can &apos;t stand the idea
of you walking around and hating me .
hate you ?
the only person i hate right now is myself ,
for asking too much of you .
i could never hate you .
but this is band of horses .
noel got tickets to band of horses ?
yeah . strictly vip .
and we get to go ?
yep . you and me ... with noel .
well , who &apos;s noel bringing ?
that &apos;s the thing--he wants to ask aria ...
but she &apos;s got this , like , anti @-@ boy zone around her .
so noel &apos;s at this place where he wants to ask her ,
but not if she &apos;s gonna say no .
so all i have to do is get aria to go ,
and we get to go .
you got it .
perfect .
i can make it happen .
i have to go do a yearbook now , but i will grab her later .
wait , yearbook ?
are you working with meta @-@ geek ?
if you mean lucas , yes .
well , watch out . cooties are contagious .
i cannot believe you just said &quot; cooties . &quot;
you &apos;re such a goober .
i dare you .
you &apos;re awful .
yes , i am . come on .
what &apos;d you think i was gonna give you ?
i don &apos;t know , one of those really sour candies .
not a chance .
i had a thought--
why don &apos;t we do something one night ,
instead of just hanging out ?
what kind of something ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe go for a real dinner someplace ,
then go somewhere , like ... a movie ?
dinner and a movie .
think there &apos;s a word for that .
what &apos;s it called when two people go out like that ?
i think they call it , um , a date .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard of that .
so you &apos;re , um ... asking me out on a date ?
two friends having dinner , going to the movies--
no big .
yeah , i &apos;m asking you on a date .
i &apos;ll think about it .
maya !
mom ?
wait , so people just let you do this ?
i mean , you go up to them and say ,
&quot; can i take a picture of your locker , &quot;
and they say yes ?
if you tell them you have to have their locker for the book ,
they think it &apos;s all about them ,
and they open right up .
gotta love that human ego .
so , i was thinking four lockers to a page
with the name underneath each picture .
no , you know , don &apos;t put the names .
they should guess whose locker is whose .
you can put numbers and a list
in the back of the book . be more fun .
yeah , it would .
i like that . it &apos;s smart .
this is impressive .
because you &apos;re used to taking pictures
by pointing your phone at people .
i like a camera that actually feels like a camera .
these aren &apos;t cheap , are they ?
no , but i auctioned some stuff online
and got a good deal for it .
well , what kind of stuff did you sell ?
stuff .
action figures ?
they were really important to me when i was 12 .
who buys action figures from 12 @-@ year @-@ old boys
who are tired of them ?
40 @-@ year @-@ old men .
and you can make money that way ?
enough money to buy the toys you &apos;re interested in now .
so , are you ...
interested in selling some stuff online ?
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t know how .
i would .
i &apos;m saying , i could help you make a couple of bucks ,
if you want me to .
yeah .
i mean , that &apos;d be great , if you could .
just tell me what you &apos;ve got two of ,
and we &apos;ll sell one of &apos; em .
just no kidneys , okay ?
em ?
it &apos;s my dad .
god , is he okay ?
he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s ... better than okay .
they &apos;re rotating his unit out of afghanistan .
my dad &apos;s coming home .
god , jenna the jerk is looking at us .
it &apos;s a very second @-@ string crowd she &apos;s with .
why doesn &apos;t she just take her &quot; d &quot; -list gang and go home
instead of sitting here and creeping me out ?
jenna &apos;s here . where &apos;s toby ?
out in the woods , sacrificing squirrels .
god . don &apos;t you ever get tired of
shooting at the low @-@ hanging fruit ?
don &apos;t ruin a perfect day , spencer .
it is perfect .
friends forever .
yeah . even when we get really old .
汤姆 · 索亚观看了自己的葬礼
就像汤姆 · 索亚 -a
okay . it is the time for you to get back to the land of the living .
you just want me to go
so you can go with sean .
it &apos;s not true ! and ...
even if it is a little bit true ,
more reason for you to come .
i don &apos;t know .
aria , what &apos;s not to know ?
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m setting you up with my dud cousin raymond
who makes miniature furniture for a hobby .
this is noel kahn .
he was your biggest crush all through middle school ,
and now he &apos;s asking you out ,
so stop pining for the fjords and &quot; carpe hottie . &quot;
it &apos;s not about the fjords .
then what &apos;s the problem ?
the problem is ...
i just can &apos;t do this right now .
well , now is all i &apos;ve got .
maybe in a few weeks .
can &apos;t you at least get over the guy by tomorrow night ?
hanna , look , my family just blew up . understand ?
well , i thought this would take your mind off of it .
i &apos;d love to get my mind off of it , but i can &apos;t .
later .
later .
well , well , well .
something new has been added .
noel kahn inspecting the troops .
you know , you really shouldn &apos;t go out so soon after a boob job .
let them drop down to where they &apos;re supposed to be
before you take &apos; em out .
prudence finn had a boob job ?
she had to do something to compensate for being named prudence .
thinking about it , aria ?
thinking about what ?
doing something like that to get noel &apos;s attention .
no .
aria likes them brainy .
cute , rich , and brainy .
you get the whole package with noel kahn .
you know , personally , i like someone with a little more maturity .
not that noel doesn &apos;t have potential .
he just lacks a little seasoning .
he &apos;s perfect for you , aria .
don &apos;t be too coy .
hello , hanna .
principal &apos;s office said i could find you in here .
well , i &apos;m pretty sure there &apos;s nothing i can do for you ,
but do you need something ?
actually , yeah .
i was wondering if emily had heard anything
from toby cavanaugh since he went missing .
do i look like emily ? ask her .
i thought you girls shared everything .
well , you were wrong .
alison &apos;s brother &apos;s in town . you knew that , didn &apos;t you ?
jason . and , yes , i know .
he &apos;s here for the dedication of ali &apos;s memorial .
oh , he &apos;s here for more than that , hanna .
he came into my office yesterday .
he came in to make noise about
how he doesn &apos;t like the way things have been handled .
i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s entitled to that .
it &apos;s a small town , hanna .
sometimes private and public lives can get a little muddled .
yeah . tell me about it .
look ...
i understand you might have some issues with me ,
but i hope you also understand
that whatever you tell jason dilaurentis
might end up being very embarrassing for your mother .
you might end up hurting the wrong people .
you know , i &apos;m a little hazy
about this whole &quot; right and wrong &quot; thing .
are you saying i should or i shouldn &apos;t tell jason
that the cop who &apos;s investigating his sister &apos;s murder
used to hang around in my house wearing a towel ?
hello ?
i @-@ it &apos;s spencer .
hello , spencer .
can i talk to you ?
of course you can .
it &apos;s about the dedication .
ali &apos;s memorial ? you &apos;re in charge of that , aren &apos;t you ?
i was .
now that jason &apos;s here , he &apos;s taken over .
does jason look the same ?
i got the impression he was different .
he sounds different .
yeah .
yeah , he is different .
he &apos;s , uh ...
polished .
polished .
you know , when i was talking to him ,
i got the strangest sensation ,
like ali was in the room with us .
what are you going to say at the dedication ?
i was gonna speak from my heart .
jenna , what do you want ?
what i want , you can &apos;t give me .
you and your friends are careless .
like i told emily ,
you &apos;re careless and you break things ,
and you think you &apos;re never gonna have to pay for them .
we are paying for it , jenna .
we &apos;re paying for it every day .
how much ?
who &apos;s counting ?
look , you want some kind of satisfaction .
i understand that .
but what you can &apos;t do , what i won &apos;t let you do ,
is to turn this dedication
into some kind of club to beat up on us .
okay , we did love her ,
and what happened was terrible .
she deserves this memorial , and so do we ,
and you don &apos;t have the right to turn it into something else .
alison was done with you .
did you know that ?
we talked about it in the hospital .
she told me why .
she said she was afraid of you .
is that why one of you did what you did ?
okay , we &apos;ve got gucci , tory burch .
i don &apos;t know why i got this lam .
thought i had shoes to match .
got a chloe and a notting hill ,
which , i swear , was not this color when i bought it in the store .
what ?
you know the way your head gets
when i talk about count dooku and darth sidious ?
well ...
that &apos;s how my head feels right now .
do you think someone will buy these ?
it &apos;s the law of the universe .
if you put something online ,
somebody somewhere &apos;s willing to buy it .
i really appreciate this , lucas .
zip .
so ... how come all of a sudden
you need to make some money ?
oh , um , my mom cut me off .
glad i can help .
creepazoid alert .
hey , hermie , you got a camera on that thing ?
making das booty or something ?
no .
my rudder got stuck .
oh . i bet it did .
go frighten the fish .
hey !
hey what ?
nothing .
never look back , hanna .
something might be gaining on you .
next .
do you want some coffee ? it &apos;s reasonably fresh .
oh , no . no thank you .
i just wanted to make sure
that i didn &apos;t forget to give you this .
i hope you &apos;re okay with cash .
cash ?
yeah . um ... hanna talked to aria ,
and she said that i should give this to you .
hanna talked to aria about money ?
yeah . for the-- for the memorial .
that money . of course . thank you .
i would have written you a check ,
but i don &apos;t trust my checkbook skills right now .
things are a little distracted at the moment .
yeah , hanna said you were on your own over there with the kids .
yes , i am on my own there .
for now .
how are you doing ?
uh ... well , i don &apos;t think i have enough information
to give you a solid answer on that one .
i understand .
well , i would pry , but then you would feel obligated
to listen to my tales of divorce ,
which i wouldn &apos;t want to put you through .
we don &apos;t know if we &apos;re gonna be getting a divorce .
that &apos;s one of the things that we need to talk about ,
once we figure out how to talk at all .
not where we thought we &apos;d be , is it ?
no , not even close .
i mean , i feel like i &apos;m living inside of this wind tunnel .
all of this stuff is just flying at me .
well , the wind dies down
to a nice , steady howl after a while .
well , does it ever just stop altogether ?
i will let you know if it does .
thanks .
you do the same for me , okay , neighbor ?
deal .
well , that was painless .
not for principal hartman .
he means well , but he needs to know who &apos;s in charge .
i think we all know that .
okay , is there a problem ?
there &apos;s no problem .
you &apos;re alison &apos;s brother .
you should have the final say .
but you &apos;re not the only one dealing with this .
see , there &apos;s that closed door again--
the secrets of the girls cuddled up in alison &apos;s bedroom .
do you think that means you knew her better than i did ?
no . it just means we knew her in a different way .
right here .
what are they doing ?
that &apos;s toby &apos;s locker .
thank you .
detective wilden .
you &apos;ll find this interesting .
we &apos;re having a look in toby cavanaugh &apos;s locker .
why ? do you think he &apos;s hiding in there ?
he &apos;s a suspect .
well , your investigation better turn up more
than toby cavanaugh &apos;s old gym socks .
you made it quite clear the other day
you weren &apos;t happy with the pace of the investigation .
you said you wanted action .
i &apos;m trying to give that to you .
yeah , you &apos;ve got nothing .
i realized that yesterday .
you know , sometimes , jason ,
we withhold information on the progress of an investigation
to avoid any interruptions .
the only reason you &apos;re tearing this kid &apos;s locker apart
is because he &apos;s not around to object .
toby cavanaugh called your sister &apos;s cell phone
the night she disappeared .
i checked the phone records . she took the call .
toby called alison the night she died ?
he did .
or somebody else did using his phone .
there go noel and prudence off to the kissing rock .
people have been sneaking off
to the kissing rock for hundreds of years .
you &apos;re making that up .
just because i make it up doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not true .
you go there with somebody , and you can feel
the ghosts of the other lovers spying on you ,
pushing you to do it .
you know , you should never disappoint a ghost .
it &apos;s just a dusty old rock .
who do you want to take there ?
this concert should be great .
most important thing about a band is the name .
i should know , &apos; cause i had one .
you had five guys in greg samson &apos;s garage .
what was the name ?
we had the best name ever-- tick beaudine .
it was some guy i saw in western when i was a kid .
guys , we should get going .
thanks for the pizza , noel .
don &apos;t put it away .
it &apos;ll be perfect room temperature when we get back .
that &apos;s the guy back with the crazy bread .
no ! no , it &apos;s too late for that .
i paid for crazy bread , i want my crazy bread .
can you at least pretend
to be having a good time , for me , please ?
i &apos;m having a great time .
aria , the lights in this house are dimming
because of all the energy you &apos;re sucking out of the air .
okay , well , i &apos;m doing the best i can .
look who &apos;s here .
it wasn &apos;t the crazy bread .
hi .
hey , lucas .
uh , i just came by to tell you
that the thing that we were talking about worked out .
oh . good .
you can look at it if you want .
okay .
i &apos;ll ... see you later .
what &apos;s he doing , coming to your house ?
uh , nothing . yearbook stuff .
what &apos;s your dad &apos;s rank ?
lieutenant colonel , pennsylvania national guard .
and he &apos;s been right in the middle of it ?
camp phoenix , in kabul .
oh , my god . when &apos;s he get back ?
ten days .
i can &apos;t imagine how happy you are .
when i see him , i &apos;ll be happy .
when he &apos;s really home ,
then i &apos;ll be able to start breathing again .
do i get to meet him ?
you were right about the weather .
rain &apos;s starting at midnight ,
continuing throughout the day .
i wish this was gonna be outside ,
in the sun .
are you satisfied ?
yeah . how about you ?
i &apos;ll just be glad when this is over .
are we talking about the dedication or ...
finding out what happened to ali ?
both , i guess .
the dedication will be fine , thanks to you .
and i lit a fire under the cops .
did you know that toby called alison ?
no .
wilden shouldn &apos;t have told me ,
but he was easy to shake up ,
like most bullies .
you were the only one
who ever really challenged alison .
i remember hearing the two of you
getting in each other &apos;s grills a couple of times .
kept waiting for the catfight , but ... never happened .
who do you think killed alison ?
the police like toby cavanaugh .
if they can &apos;t find him ,
they &apos;ll start liking someone else .
just someone , or someone in particular ?
does it really matter ?
i thought you said you wanted closure .
my mom still needs pills to get to sleep .
when they don &apos;t work ,
you can hear her walking around the house
at three in the morning .
you think you &apos;re ever really gonna have closure ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you always going to be
&quot; the friend of that girl who was murdered &quot; ?
just like you &apos;ll always be her brother ?
that &apos;s how people will see us .
they solve it or they don &apos;t .
that &apos;s not going to change , so ...
i guess it doesn &apos;t really matter .
but what about justice ?
you don &apos;t really want to bring justice into this , do you ?
why not ?
alison told me about the fire .
about how you said the five of you should all go over
and teach toby a lesson .
how you got the stink bomb and ...
convinced the rest of the girls to back you up .
how you even threatened toby if he told the truth .
alison told you that ?
yes , she did .
did you believe her ?
you are just like alison , aren &apos;t you ?
in some ways , even worse .
you okay ?
sure .
we all just wondered what happened to you .
sorry .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah , i guess .
i just want to be clear on something , okay ?
remind me , did i run over your dog or something ?
because i don &apos;t remember
doing anything to get you this mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad at you .
could have fooled me .
i &apos;m sorry , noel .
i ...
i should have said no to this .
it was a bad idea .
bad idea going out ,
or a bad idea going out with me ?
no . it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re great . i mean ...
you &apos;re noel .
terrific . i &apos;m a brand name .
i heard about your folks splitting up .
they &apos;re not split . they &apos;re separated .
and hanna ... told me about the boy back in iceland .
she shouldn &apos;t have told you that .
so i guess this guy was serious .
yeah . he was special .
he is special , but ...
right now there &apos;s just all this distance between us .
does he speak english ?
beautifully .
too bad .
i was hoping for a language barrier .
yeah , i mean , i know what i want to happen with him ...
but ...
i also know that i have to be realistic ,
and there &apos;s only a couple of ways that all this can play out ,
and it ranges from messy to bad .
and even if it does work out ,
i still have my family to worry about .
a minute ago , back when i got you to smile ,
i thought i might try for a kiss .
now i think i &apos;ll wait ,
but i &apos;m gonna keep my options open ...
if that &apos;s okay with you .
wait , so she tried to pin it on you ?
that &apos;s what she told jason .
but why you ?
because spencer could stand up to her ,
and alison didn &apos;t like that .
god , this is officially insane !
is that what she told jenna
when she was at the hospital ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i don &apos;t think so , but i don &apos;t know .
okay , so-- so one minute , she &apos;s trying to cover it up
and the next she &apos;s ratting us out to her brother ?
like she wanted jason to know the fake story
in case anything happened to her .
why ?
so they &apos;d know who to blame .
god !
this is still alison &apos;s movie ,
and we are just filling up the screen .
you went to the grocery store .
uh , yeah . i sold some stuff online .
you sold some stuff online ?
just a couple of bags i was bored with .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
don &apos;t sell your things !
no , it &apos;s okay .
really , it was fun , in a nerdy way .
you shouldn &apos;t have to do that .
i will take care of things . i promise .
mom , don &apos;t worry about it . really .
you should get going .
you don &apos;t want to be late .
okay .
ian ?
wait-- melissa &apos;s ian ?
i can &apos;t remember not knowing alison ...
not having her as a friend .
she was the first person i knew long enough
that i felt i could be angry with
without worrying that i was gonna lose her .
it made me feel like something was gonna last ,
and you need that ,
especially when you &apos;re a kid .
friends can be hard on you .
maybe they expect more from you than strangers .
strangers pretty much see you
the way you want them to see you ,
but ... you can &apos;t fool friends .
that &apos;s what makes them friends .
that corner of the park is going to be a safe place
where you can go and sit , read a book ,
and just think .
you should think about alison while you &apos;re there .
she &apos;d want to make sure you didn &apos;t forget about her .
you do something like this--
a memorial--
partly because you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happened .
so , you-- you plant flowers and you paint tiles , and ...
somewhere in the middle of all that work ,
you stop crying .
i guess that &apos;s the point .
she would have liked that you were all here .
she would have liked the attention .
no , actually , she would have loved the attention .
it would have made her laugh .
and alison laughing ...
that was amazing .
we think we know who we are ,
but we don &apos;t .
not until something bad happens to us ,
and then all the useless things fall away ,
and we &apos;re left with who we really are .
i learnt that from alison dilaurentis .
my whole life , i thought i knew who she was ,
but i found out the truth
when she came and talked to me at the hospital .
i found out
that she was the strongest person
that i had ever met .
and it &apos;s her strength that touched so many people .
shaped them .
that &apos;s her real legacy .
that &apos;s how her memory will endure ,
in the actions of those she inspired
in so many different ways .
from all of us ...
thank you , alison .
i need sugar .
me too .
i &apos;m buying .
that was my folks .
they say thanks .
so do i.
you &apos;re welcome .
and i want you girls to have something .
the police returned this to my family .
i think you should have it .
the police gave that to you ?
alison was wearing it .
you mean when they found her ?
after listening today ,
i just ... thought you should have it .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
if that &apos;s alison &apos;s bracelet ,
what about the one we found in the woods ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
someone made a copy of alison &apos;s bracelet .
