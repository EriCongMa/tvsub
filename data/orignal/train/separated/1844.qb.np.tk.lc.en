biology determines much of the way we live .
from the moment we &apos;re born ,
we know how to breathe and eat .
as we grow older , new instincts kick in .
oh . we become territorial .
towel .
oh .
ow ! oh , sorry . jeez . sorry .
yeah .
you know this isn &apos;t normal
we learn to compete .
yo , torres .
oh , shoot . i told him i &apos;d work out this morning .
but this is like working out . it &apos;s just more fun .
come on . no pain , no gain .
go away , mark !
nice . he &apos;s lonely .
did you just say my-- oh ! oh !
right . nice .
you finish . i &apos;ll wait .
we seek shelter .
take a look at some of the fine details up here .
it was built around the turn of the century .
wait . these are the original doors ?
you bet .
wait till you see the upstairs .
antique hardware on those windows .
that &apos;s a cool fireplace .
you know , it &apos;s really a lot of space .
if we knock through this wall ,
we &apos;d get all that light to flood through .
hey , you like the , uh , the firemen &apos;s pole ?
mm .
okay . um , this could be our house .
i kinda need you to care .
we &apos;ll think about it .
most important of all ? we reproduce .
i drank a lot of tequila in college ... after
well , it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve done my o.b. rotations ,
but i don &apos;t recall tequila getting in the way of conception .
it &apos;s the opposite , actually .
i ... could have , uh , endometriosis or adhesions or--
look , she &apos;s gonna come in here ,
and she &apos;s gonna say everything &apos;s fine .
sometimes biology can turn on us , though .
so ... we have a few things to discuss here .
yeah , biology sucks sometimes .
本性难移
&quot; hostile &quot; ?
did she really call my uterus hostile ?
are you forgetting what she said after that ?
what , about my hostile uterus
causing me to miscarry the first time ,
or the likelihood that it &apos;ll happen again ?
but there is a treatment . she said--
hostile .
well , you &apos;re just getting stuck on a word .
how would you feel
if she called your penis &quot; angry &quot; or &quot; snide &quot; ?
that &apos;s a good point ,
but the important thing is that you &apos;re healthy .
just think of all the fun we &apos;re gonna have trying now .
i &apos;m late for rounds .
you paged ?
did you know that bariatric centers are some of the leading moneymakers
in hospitals right now , dr. bailey ?
i have rounds , sir .
and that &apos;s interesting ,
considering that seattle grace doesn &apos;t have one .
and do you know why we don &apos;t have one , dr . bailey ?
space , dr . bailey . we don &apos;t have enough space .
oh , oh , chief , okay ,
if you go anywhere near my denny duquette memorial clinic ,
you will come to work tomorrow and find me
and every nurse who loves me chained to its doors .
we need money , bailey .
ever since the shooting , we &apos;ve been in survival mode
when we need to be in fight mode ,
groundbreaking surgery mode , back @-@ to @-@ number @-@ one @-@ ranking mode .
it &apos;s my turn to have cristina yang on my service .
that &apos;s all the fight i have in me today .
hostile uterus .
mm . house hunting with my husband .
at least it &apos;s not cancer .
at least you &apos;re calling him your husband .
oh . baby steps . whatev .
hey , uh , do you know how long april and jackson are planning
to stay in the house ?
uh , as long as they like . why ?
well , aapril &apos;s taken over lizzie &apos;s room ,
which was fine when it was temporary ,
but i live in the attic ,
and i sleep next to christmas ornaments . hmm .
april &apos;s best friend just died , and she &apos;s all alone .
i &apos;m not evil . it &apos;s just ... she &apos;s annoying .
okay ? i find her annoying .
really ? i find you much more annoying .
car ran into a laundromat . multiple traumas !
i &apos;m not wrong .
mm . pretty annoying .
you coming ?
baby steps don &apos;t include multiple traumas .
you go kill it .
oh , hi . you need to start sleeping with mark again .
i do ?
yeah , for my sake , you do .
he won &apos;t leave us alone .
at the apartment , at--at work , i mean , in our bedroom--
it &apos;s like i &apos;m dating mark against my will .
come on . twice a week . that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
i am not babysitting mark for you .
besides , i am too tired for sex with anyone right now .
i was up all night dictating charts again .
well , you know , there &apos;s a thing called a resident
that can do that for you .
yeah , and my resident is avery .
he still knocking over trays in the o.r. ?
yes ,
and scribbling patient orders in his thi @-@ grade scrawl
and paging me in the middle of the night
for patients who are nowhere near dying .
at least he &apos;s nice to look at .
true .
thank you .
you just got called a dumb blond .
can you find out about my husband ? his name &apos;s larry .
he was in the car with you ?
no , he was in the laundromat . i @-@ i hit him .
i don &apos;t remember anything .
i was in the car outside the laundromat ,
and the next thing i know , the car &apos;s inside the laundromat ,
and there was screaming .
okay .
do you want to order her labs or take her scans ?
you can take her . take it all , taker .
what ?
lost vitals in the ambulance bay .
get me epi and charge the defibrillator now .
larry . that &apos;s him ! that--that &apos;s my husband .
that &apos;s ... is he gonna be okay ?
i cannot go out this way .
i @-@ i can &apos;t die in a freak laundromat accident .
ow !
sorry .
you cannot find anything wrong .
i &apos;m supposed to go to brazil next week .
rio .
and i just perfected my accent .
voce tem uma camisinha ?
i &apos;m ... fine . how are you ?
nope . i just asked you if you had a condom .
cause that &apos;s the one sentence i learn
before traveling some place now .
yeah . now you totally think i &apos;m a slut .
oh , i don &apos;t . um ... take a breath for me , please .
it totally makes you think i &apos;m a slut
until i tell you
i have huntington &apos;s disease .
yeah , you &apos;re not gonna find it on the chart .
the paramedic was so cute ,
so i just didn &apos;t mention anything ,
because , you know , the whole fatal genetic coition ,
it just doesn &apos;t scream &quot; sexy . &quot;
have you started showing symptoms ?
no .
my , uh , my mother died ,
so i got tested for the gene .
she was 45,
so i have about 10 years left .
or five if you count the ones i can actually enjoy .
well , the accident shouldn &apos;t affect your huntington &apos;s .
i know that . i &apos;m just telling you
so that you get that you have to work really hard to fix me ,
because i can live with the fact that i &apos;m gonna die ,
but to die doing laundry ? no .
i want to accidentally fall off the eiffel tower
because the three men and the multiple orgasms
were too much .
you should &apos;ve seen it , dr. robbins .
his pottaballet kicked the other kids &apos; asses .
it &apos;s pas de bourree , dad .
isn &apos;t that what i said ?
you said it in american , fred . it &apos;s french , right , sweetie ?
yes , and it &apos;s not something that you really kick ass at .
can we talk about the cancer now ?
anything to make them stop .
yeah . um , dr. karev ?
jake fisher , 15 , uh , osteosarcoma of the right tibia .
today he &apos;ll be getting a minor bone dissection .
how long after the surgery before i can dance again ?
he &apos;s anxious &apos; cause his ballet company
is doing &quot; swan lake &quot; this spring .
yeah , it &apos;s like his super bowl .
jake , your recovery
will depend on today &apos;s scans .
they &apos;ll tell us how much the chemo shrunk the tumor ,
but trust me , we will have you back on your feet
as soon as possible , okay ?
okay , can you tell me
when the pain started , mr. fink ?
a @-@ a few days ago .
i &apos;m a biologist . i &apos;m in the middle of an experiment .
pan .
okay .
oh . stop ! don &apos;t take that anywhere .
that could be research lost .
sir , you &apos;re very sick .
you need to put aside your work for the moment .
it &apos;s not just work . it &apos;s a cure for asthma .
what ?
dr. bailey .
just get rid of the vomit , yang .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think you want me to do that .
there &apos;s my cure .
isn &apos;t he beautiful ?
research has found ,
worms produce an enzyme that cut down on allergies .
i &apos;m applying the theory to asthma .
you eat worms ?
yang . how long do these experiments last ?
standard is a month or two .
and then i take the antiparasitic to pass them .
but i can extract more enzyme
the longer i grow them .
a year is pushing it , apparently .
you &apos;ve had these worms inside of you for a year ?
343 days to be exact .
haven &apos;t had an asthma attack in six months .
dr. bailey .
my , they &apos;ve grown .
you have a nasty bowel obstruction , mr. fink .
you need surgery .
oh , no . that won &apos;t do .
surgery will throw off the entire experiment .
i &apos;d like another option .
sir . okay , i &apos;m sorry , but--
it &apos;s three years research , dr. bailey .
research you &apos;d be contaminating the minute you cut me open .
okay , dr. yang &apos;s gonna give you fluid
and put an n.g.tube down your nose
to open the obstruction .
it will be painful ,
and if you don &apos;t improve in a few hours ,
you &apos;re getting the surgery .
option two it is then .
you know he &apos;s crazy , right ?
crazy is relative , yang .
in fact , some people might say missing rounds this morning
when i &apos;m in charge is crazy behavior , too .
but here i am , trusting you to take care of my patient .
maybe i &apos;m the crazy one . what do you think ?
am i crazy to trust you
to take care of my patient ?
no .
but i haven &apos;t been swallowing worms .
well , his pain is not too bad .
that means his tumor probably shrunk , right ?
if the chemo did its job .
guess who just scored a table
at that new sushi place that &apos;s impossible to get in to ?
no way .
8 : 30 , table for 3 .
oh , you know , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t eat sushi .
yeah , you do .
yeah , i did .
i did , but then i got sick after i ate
one of those prepackaged rolls at the cafeteria .
bad memory . you two go .
i &apos;ll change the reservation to two .
what ?
torres , you should see this .
god . i hate this job sometimes .
lila , your c.t. shows that you have a ruptured diaphragm ,
so you &apos;re gonna need surgery .
so how will we proceed , dr. avery ?
part of your stomach &apos;s gone into your chest .
so we &apos;ll place your stomach back
and repair the diaphragm with mesh .
dr. grey , do you agree ?
no , i would do a direct repair with suture instead of mesh
because the defect is so small .
that &apos;s right .
all right , dr. grey , draw pre @-@ op labs .
you &apos;re scrubbing in .
lila , do you need us to call anyone for you ?
no . it &apos;s just me .
but i would like it if he would wait by my bedside .
yeah , you and every other woman in this hospital .
all right . i &apos;ll see you in the o.r.
thank you .
oh , please tell me you &apos;ve gotten to make out with that .
no . married , so no .
that &apos;s a bummer .
any babies ?
uh , no , but thinking about it .
um , did you need me to scrub in too ?
the question should be &quot; may i scrub in ? &quot;
like you want to .
right . it &apos;s may--may i.
no , i think i &apos;ve got all the hands i need .
dr. altman ...
i know .
okay , i &apos;ve been off my game lately ,
and you &apos;ve suffered because of it .
but right now , i need you to give me another chance .
okay ? please . i ...
look , i want to scrub in , okay ?
okay . yeah . just , um ...
okay . okay .
mrs. davis &apos; scans are clean ?
yeah , so is her ultrasound . i think we should do an e.e.g.
really ? do you think that &apos;s really--
she lost control of her parked car ,
has no memory of how , so i think that &apos;s necessary ,
but you outrank me , so ... whatever .
well , sure , fine . let &apos;s do it .
um ... hey , how would you feel
if i started a chore wheel at the house ?
the boys are so messy ,
and i did one with reed at our old apartment ,
and you &apos;d be surprised how well it works .
are you moving in , like , permanently ?
why ? do--do you think that &apos;s not okay ?
should i talk to meredith about that ?
well , that &apos;s up to you ,
but i wouldn &apos;t bring up the chore wheel .
meredith would hate that .
hey , how &apos;s our reckless driver ?
uh , she &apos;s not reckless .
she may have had syncope or a seizure--
hey , mer . lexie and i were just talking about the housing situation--
if this is about izzie &apos;s room--
no .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not about izzie &apos;s room .
it &apos;s about a chore wheel .
april would like to start one .
that &apos;s a great idea .
what ?
great . i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll set it up tonight .
great .
hey , um ... how &apos;d it go this morning ?
eh .
what happened this morning ?
but you &apos;re okay , right ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
why wouldn &apos;t you be fine ?
nothing . i have to go .
wh-- what was this morning ?
you should talk to meredith .
what are they saying ?
are they saying the chemo didn &apos;t work ?
we should wait for your parents .
oh , my god .
you want to cut off my leg ?
oh , my god .
uh , look ...
there &apos;s a sprinter with prosthetics
that runs faster than guys with real legs .
there &apos;s gotta be another way .
more--more chemo or--
yeah , but with prosthetics today , it &apos;s--it &apos;s amazing .
you don &apos;t get it ! i need my leg !
i get it .
no , you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s--i ... i @-@ i can &apos;t explain it .
i , um ... just ...
i &apos;ll show you .
l @-@ let me show you .
if he gets injured , this is on you , karev .
you see that ?
that &apos;s my boy .
it &apos;s that ...
right there .
build me a leg that &apos;ll let me do that .
did she called it hostile ?
that &apos;s ... well , at least it &apos;s nothing too serious .
i &apos;ll do some research on treatment options .
her uterus is friendly .
it &apos;s sunshiny .
untouched by scourge of man .
peppy ovaries , too .
hey , the vending machine &apos;s working again .
what ?
nothing .
is this the same nothing
that has to do with where you were this morning ?
i was at the dentist this morning . i have bad teeth .
oh , okay , so &quot; teeth &quot; are code for what ?
i went to the o.b. today .
i have massive , baby @-@ squishing fibroids in my uterus .
oh , that &apos;s terrible .
eh , get over it .
but you knew ?
knew what ?
nothing . the vending machine &apos;s working again .
my patient eats worms .
dude , altman fire you yet ?
she is not gonna fire me .
what &apos;d you do ?
she think he &apos;s a hot piece of brainless ass .
oh , you &apos;re totally gonna be fired .
the situation is under control . thank you .
you got a line on any weird bone cancer treatments
so i don &apos;t have to cut off my ballerina kid &apos;s leg ?
right , &apos; cause my memory is all i &apos;m good for ?
there was a story in the news recently
where they used a cadaver bone to replace a cancerous one .
you get my fries .
ooh .
you paged ?
yeah ,
dr. knox &apos;s sister just put her house on the market .
they just redid it . it &apos;s close to meredith &apos;s house ,
and it has never been a fire station , right ?
you paged me to talk real estate ?
w--that and i thought you might want to observe .
our guy , he got caught between a car and washing machine ,
and you don &apos;t see that kind of crush injury every day ,
but no pressure .
thank you , but i have to monitor worms .
a rotationplasty ?
no , no , it &apos;s not possible with this part of the leg .
fibular grafting ?
oh , no . cancer &apos;s seeded to his fibula .
what ?
you don &apos;t like mark . admit it .
i like mark .
liar .
i like him . i do .
we &apos;re just , you know ... we &apos;re different .
oh , my god . how are you different ?
tell me , &apos; cause i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t think you actually are .
mnh @-@ mnh .
what ?
should i leave ?
shut it , karev . i &apos;m waiting .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t like mark .
it &apos;s just that he &apos;s ... mark .
you know , what you see is what you get .
besides , you like him ,
so what do i care if his abs are where his soul should be ?
oh , my god .
found it !
found it right here .
we don &apos;t have to cut off his leg .
page dr. bailey and book an o.r.
mm @-@ hmm .
surgery ? no , please .
can &apos;t we wait just a little longer ?
your bowel could perforate and fill your abdomen
with fecal matter , so , no , we cannot wait .
can you at least salvage the worms during the surgery ?
your life is at risk because of a hypothesis you can &apos;t support .
otherwise , you would have the backing of an actual accredited institute .
so let the worms go .
i worked in those institutes my whole life .
i sat in labs ,
ran other people &apos;s experiments .
i was dead inside .
and now for the first time ,
i know what i &apos;m meant to do with my life ,
and everything else-- all my quirks , my fears ,
the fact that people find me strange--
none of it matters
because i know who i am .
please .
save the worms .
let &apos;s get him prepped .
&quot; stroke , infection ,
heart attack , severe bleeding , loss of life &quot; ?
oh , what the hell ?
when did the chorea start ?
chorea ? i call that my spastic hand trick .
a few months ago , i guess .
you told your doctors ? they know , right ?
lila .
i--no guilt trip , please .
i was just starting to like you .
but you need to tell your doctors ,
because they can help you .
i watched my mother go through this , dr. grey .
i @-@ i know how this goes .
after the spastic hand comes the slurred speech ,
and then the trouble walking , and the difficulty eating ,
and the seizures , and the memory loss ,
and then the dementia sets in so badly
that you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re in the supermarket
or the bathroom .
so screw going to the freakin &apos; doctor .
i am going to brazil .
ah , dr. grey .
i can use your input .
do you think derek would consider
putting his face on a billboard ?
oh . that &apos;s a lot of derek .
pretty good picture , right ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what do you need ?
when my mother was still here before she retired ...
do you think that she ever tried to tell you
about the alzheimer &apos;s ?
no , no .
she kept it a secret for years .
no , i know that , but ...
um , when do you think it started ?
do you think she was trying to tell you ,
and you didn &apos;t really realize that &apos;s
what she was trying to do , was tell you ?
well , it &apos;s possible , i guess .
uh , and i don &apos;t remember ...
is everything okay , meredith ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine . just ...
i would never go to a hospital
that put its doctors on billboards ,
for what it &apos;s worth .
his b.p. has dropped to 90 over 60,
and he &apos;s showing signs of peritonitis .
good work , yang . you &apos;re free to scrub in if you like ,
uh , even just to observe .
no one &apos;s gonna make you do anything you don &apos;t want .
i &apos;m not ready .
thank you , though , for asking .
okay , so we &apos;ll take out the bone , and then
treat it with high doses of radiation to kill the cancer .
30 minutes later , we reinsert the bone back into jake &apos;s leg .
usually the procedure is done using a cadaver bone ,
so there &apos;s no risk of putting cancer back in the body ,
but we couldn &apos;t find a match for jake on such short notice .
so there &apos;s a chance the cancer could come back ?
well , that &apos;s why amputation &apos;s less risky .
but if we do this , if you agree ,
we will monitor jake closely , scans every few months ,
and if the cancer returns , we &apos;ll do the amputation .
but this is done a lot ?
uh , it &apos;s only been done a few times in the world .
so if we do this , i mean , if we say yes ,
there &apos;s a chance he &apos;d keep his leg forever ?
we hope .
it &apos;s a big risk , buddy .
god knows , i love to watch you dance , but ...
what would you do ?
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s between you and your folks , jake .
no .
i want to know .
what would you do ?
if it was my arm , and , uh ,
i couldn &apos;t operate anymore , i ...
i &apos;d do everything that i could to keep it .
well , we &apos;ve run an e.k.g. , c.t. ,
and done blood work .
fortunately , they &apos;ve all come back normal .
you mean unfortunately .
they &apos;re waiting to take my statement .
well , it was just an accident , mrs. davis .
you probably just pressed the wrong pedal .
oh , tell that to them .
they throw people in jail all the time
for this sort of thing .
there is another test we can run .
what ?
it &apos;s called a tilt test .
it can tell us if you fainted before the accident .
we &apos;ll schedule it right away .
did you get approval for a tilt test ?
no .
okay , well , i hate to pull rank here ,
but i am a year ahead of you--
we &apos;re at work , april , there &apos;s no chore wheel .
if i want to run a tilt test , i &apos;m gonna run a tilt test .
i &apos;d throw a party .
fly everyone to an amazing beach ,
all expenses paid .
i mean , i &apos;d have to max out my credit cards
in order to pay for it , but what do i care ?
i wouldn &apos;t be around to have to pay it off .
suction .
i &apos;d do what lila did . i &apos;d quit , sell the house ,
and bum around the globe .
and how would derek feel about that ?
ah , he could come along if he wanted .
there &apos;s something sad about that , though .
wandering around , living in hotels--
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not a life .
this , though , even if i was gonna die tomorrow ,
i &apos;d still want to do it .
can i try the diaphragm repair ?
what ?
the repair , can i ...
can i try it ?
uh , n-- uh , no , no , you can &apos;t .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m good , though . thank you .
oh , he &apos;s hypertensive . get his pressure back up .
okay , get some saline in here quick . clamp .
i need more irrigation in here now .
right away .
dr. bailey , what &apos;s wrong ?
he &apos;s perforated .
i have to evacuate this abscess . suction .
suction .
can &apos;t you just use antibiotics ?
if i want to risk losing him .
he needs his worms back for his research .
the suction will destroy them .
look , i &apos;m concerned about his life right now , dr. yang ,
not his research .
suction .
you did really good with this kid today , karev .
impressive , which is funny ,
&apos;cause i wouldn &apos;t think
that you &apos;d be good in peds just by looking at you .
okay , fine . i don &apos;t like mark ... at all .
there . i said it .
&apos;cause you never even tried . ugh .
take jake here . you think his dad was happy
when jake wanted ballet shoes for christmas and not cleats ?
no , this guy wanted a kid he could throw a ball with ,
you know he did , but his son loved to dance ,
so he signed him up for lessons , went to recitals ,
learned what there was to love about ballet .
he tried ...
because he loved his kid .
mark stares at my boobs when we talk .
he starts with my face , but then somewhere along the way ,
he gets distracted and ends up on my boobs .
and i love guys . i love them .
but i have tried my whole life to avoid the boob @-@ staring guy .
biology even helped me by making me gay .
but now my girlfriend &apos;s bestend is that guy .
and i don &apos;t think that i need to apologize for the fact
that the only person i want staring at my boobs is you .
boobs , really ?
you &apos;re making this about boobs ?
he stares at them .
&apos;cause they &apos;re good boobs .
can i leave now ?
yes . go . hurry .
so we had to remove his spleen and a kidney ,
but i expect a full recovery .
and the girl that was inside ?
uh , she &apos;s out of surgery now . she &apos;s doing great .
oh , thank god .
and as for your tests ,
you &apos;re in tip @-@ top shape , mrs . davis .
i &apos;ll talk to the police ,
um , tell them to come back tomorrow
so you can have some time alone with your husband .
he &apos;s not my husband anymore .
what ?
larry left me three months ago .
he said he needed time to himself to think .
a week later , i find out he &apos;s living with someone else .
her name &apos;s kimmy .
she sings in the choir at our church .
kimmy .
it &apos;s a ridiculous name , right ?
this morning , i &apos;m on my way to the post office ...
when i see his car outside the laundromat .
38 years of marriage ,
and not once did he pick up a bottle of detergent .
so i pulled over .
he was inside
folding a pair of ...
hot pink panties ...
doing her laundry .
she wasn &apos;t even there !
the next thing i know ,
my car &apos;s inside the laundromat .
i feel badly ...
for that ...
poor innocent girl i hit .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad she &apos;s okay .
but ...
i know now why they call it the green @-@ eyed monster .
mrs. davis , i @-@ i think that , um--
no , it &apos;s awful to unload on you . i know . i know .
but i figured you &apos;re used to it .
people must tell you their secrets all the time
because of the doctor @-@ patient confidentiality law , right ?
that only applies to medicine .
no , no .
you are required to keep my secrets .
no , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s lawyers .
dr. avery , i need you to--
oh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll come back .
no , no , no , please . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s cool .
what do you need ?
right .
i wasn &apos;t sure if i was making up stuff in my head ,
but ... now i know .
i &apos;m doing a cabg . how do i start ?
wait , what ?
i &apos;m doing a cabg tomorrow .
you want to scrub in , so tell me how i start . go .
um , divide the sternum , open the thymus ,
incise the pericardium ,
then take down the mammary artery with the cautery--
bypass has started . now what ?
cross @-@ clamp the aorta ,
instill antegrade cardioplegia ,
followed by retrograde
now i want to take him off bypass .
rewarm , check the flow of grafts , vent the root--
that &apos;s enough .
good . i &apos;m relieved .
you &apos;re actually more than the pretty face
you make yourself out to be .
you knocked over a tray in my o.r. ,
you get the answer wrong sometimes ,
your penmanship needs work .
none of these are fireable offenses .
but flirting ? flirting into my surgery ,
batting your eyes while i &apos;m inside a chest cavity ?
i should go to the chief and have you fired right now .
i &apos;m not gonna do that this time .
now put your shirt on
and take care of these post @-@ ops .
there you are .
i &apos;ve been paging you .
oh , my patient needs his worms . i &apos;m trying to save &apos; em .
a head .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , i , uh , need you to take my blood .
for what ?
so i can get tested for the alzheimer &apos;s gene .
i mean , it &apos;s time i know one way or the other , right ?
i have a hostile uterus .
what &apos;s a little alzheimer &apos;s , too ?
okay .
this is a lot bigger than a baby step .
just do it before i change my mind .
okay .
you &apos;re still here ?
i had to drop these off before i left .
it &apos;s medication for your hand ,
but you will have to see your doctor and get it refilled
when you get back from your trip .
they can help you , lila
i &apos;ll go . promise .
oh , come on .
i said i &apos;ll go . no guilt trip , please .
biology says that we are who we are from birth ,
that our d.n.a. is set in stone ,
unchangeable .
there was a complication ,
but we were able to take care of it in surgery .
you &apos;re gonna be fine as long as you quit the worms .
i understand .
the surgery destroyed them all .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
well ...
every experiment has its ups and downs .
how much time would you think
before my bowel is completely healed ?
no , if you do this again , you could die .
do you understand that ?
only if i make the same mistakes .
i won &apos;t .
decrease the quantity , shorten the time frame--
no , no , wait , wait , wait .
why would you want to put yourself through this again ?
because i love what i do ...
more than anything .
you don &apos;t find something you love that much
and let it go .
you hold on to it , throw yourself in deeper .
our d.n.a doesn &apos;t account for all of us , though .
we &apos;re human .
life changes us .
post @-@ ops are stable ,
and i &apos;ve ordered morning labs .
mm . thanks .
you know , sloan risked his life to save mine ,
even when i was sleeping with his girl .
that &apos;s not a guy without a soul .
maybe he &apos;s an ass who stares at boobs ,
but whatever .
and your boobs , you--you have nice boobs .
maybe they &apos;re lesbian boobs ,
and you don &apos;t like men staring at them ,
but men don &apos;t discriminate when it comes to jugs .
you have hot boobs , and i stare at &apos; em , too .
we develop new traits ...
i was--i was in the driver &apos;s seat of the car ...
become less territorial .
hey , so reckless driver
turned out to be a psycho killer ?
failed psycho killer , thank god .
she was heartbroken , okay ?
her husband left her for a younger version of herself .
she &apos;s just ...
lexie
no , you know what ?
i have been a total bitch to april all day because of you .
you know that ?
what ?
i &apos;m j--i &apos;m gonna go . i--
april , just ... stay .
you worry about april , you let her have izzie &apos;s room ,
you talk to her about your doctor &apos;s appointments .
and i went crazy ,
alex ditched me in a psych ward ,
mark slept with derek &apos;s sister ,
and now i find myself ...
relating to the crazy , jealous lady
who drives into laundromats .
april , you should go .
lexie ...
i ... had a miscarriage that day .
april was there .
that &apos;s why she knows about my doctor &apos;s appointment .
and i did know that mark slept with amy ,
but i didn &apos;t think you cared .
i can never tell what the hell is going on with you two .
and as far as the psych ward goes ,
you were not alone .
i sat by your bedside for 36 hours while you slept .
you &apos;re not crazy , lexie .
you &apos;re a grey .
we stop competing .
change of plans .
mark , you &apos;re taking me to dinner tonight .
what ?
we &apos;re going on a date , you and i , alone .
is this to make up for the fact that you don &apos;t like me ?
mm . you told him ?
no , i ...
she didn &apos;t need to .
fine .
let &apos;s go , but you are buying .
thank you .
you , uh , you still want italian ?
mm . eyes on my face , mark .
ah .
we learn from our mistakes .
just--boys out . go .
just ... take the towel ... and go .
all right .
hey , seriously , if you want the room--
i admitted that i wanted to drive my car over you ...
so taking the room would just make me feel worse .
okay . but if you put up a freakin &apos; chore wheel ,
i &apos;ll kill you .
we face our greatest fears .
hey .
hi .
oh .
hi .
hi .
what ?
i am ...
getting tested for the alzheimer &apos;s gene .
oh . no .
i should know . we should know .
no .
my uterus is hostile .
we probably can &apos;t even have a baby .
and even if we could ,
my brain is probably full of alzheimer &apos;s ,
so i wouldn &apos;t even remember the baby &apos;s name .
or even worse , i &apos;ll pass the alzheimer &apos;s on to the baby .
then you &apos;d have an 80 @-@ year @-@ old drooling wife
and a 50 @-@ year @-@ old drooling kid .
i don &apos;t care .
derek ...
listen , i love you , and you love me .
and ... whatever happens ...
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t want to know .
i mean it . i don &apos;t want to know .
well , the lab already has my blood , so ...
okay , so here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do--
no more doctors , no more labs ,
and you and we have a lot of sex .
maybe we can make a baby , maybe not .
maybe you get alzheimer &apos;s , maybe not .
but just ...
screw the odds , screw the science .
let &apos;s just live .
whatever happens ... happens .
me and you ...
okay ?
okay .
okay .
for better or worse ,
we find ways to become more than our biology .
the risk , of course ...
cristina ?
cristina .
is that we can change too much ...
welcome home .
to the point , we don &apos;t recognize ourselves .
it &apos;s ours . we bought it .
well , i bought it , but , uh , it &apos;s for the both of us .
finding our way back can be difficult .
there &apos;s no compass , no map .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
our house has a fire pole in it .
what else is there to say ?
you said this morning--
i don &apos;t care where we live .
i really don &apos;t , but you do .
you love this place .
and i love you .
we just have to close our eyes ,
take a step ,
and hope to god we &apos;ll get there .
