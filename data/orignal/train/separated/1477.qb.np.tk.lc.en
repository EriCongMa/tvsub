i didn &apos;t say anything .
stop talking .
that &apos;s talking .
you think she &apos;s asleep yet ?
i &apos;m on the same side of the door as you are .
stop talking .
cam .
lily lost her first tooth today .
and she &apos;s very excited about the visit from the tooth fairy .
when i have my first loose tooth ,
my mom tied one end of the string to it ,
the other to the tail of a cow
fired off a 12 @-@ gauge shotgun ,
and the cow went running out of the room .
that never happened .
tell that to the cow @-@ shaped hole in my bedroom wall .
gotcha !
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re not the tooth fairy .
n @-@ no . but we just wanted to see if she &apos;d come yet .
no . she sure is taking her sweet time .
maybe you should just go back to sleep , sweetie .
yeah .
&apos;cause it could take a while .
i &apos;ve got nowhere to be .
mom , i can &apos;t be late today .
sanjay patel and i are dissecting a pig .
so sad what passes for a date in your life .
haley .
he keeps asking me to hand him all of the instruments .
he wants me to act like a nurse .
now it sounds like a date in haley &apos;s life .
okay , before you say no ...
no .
you haven &apos;t even seen it yet .
mm , i &apos;m sticking with &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s for luke &apos;s career day .
i thought i &apos;d offer the kids a chance
to put their face on my body .
i just heard it , too .
how come you guys never had a career day ?
cutbacks .
nor &apos;easter .
today i get to talk about the love of my life ...
residential real estate .
he really doesn &apos;t hear it .
i wanna make luke proud .
i wanna be his hero like my dad was
when he talked to my class
about running a grocery store .
he came in with two price guns in holsters
and marked our teacher at $ 1.29
before she knew what hit her .
i bet that produced a lot of laughs .
claire , please .
and olivia berman &apos;s mom
works in the rare books department at the library .
hope i get a chance to pick that brain .
looks like you got quite the career day lineup .
so i guess they already got a closet guy coming in , huh ?
no . i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d wanna do it .
i don &apos;t , but you know , i just feel bad for the kids .
a lot of interesting stories in the closet biz .
oh . why have you never told us any ?
okay . well , for example , there was this guy ...
must have had over a hundred hats ...
yes ?
and we had to fit them in the closet .
okay ?
and we did .
all right . maybe it &apos;s not the most exciting career in the world ,
but it pays the bills .
no one is complaining .
were there other things i &apos;d rather do ? yes .
but i had to make ends meet .
what other things ?
well , i always wanted to write thrillers .
like that hat story ?
spy thrillers .
i &apos;ve been kicking around this character ,
cia agent chuck stone , who doesn &apos;t care
how much his antics annoy the brass in arlington .
why didn &apos;t you ever try it ?
i was busy with work and family .
i was gonna start writing after my divorce ,
but you know ... life got in the way .
why do you point at me when you say &quot; life &quot; ?
am i &quot; life &quot; ?
i meant you keep my busy .
you had a 3 @-@ hour nap on sunday .
i was tired . from what ?
your 2 @-@ hour nap on saturday ?
jay , i &apos;ve been with you for five years ,
and i &apos;ve never heard you mention anything about writing .
hey . i bought a typewriter .
a typewriter ?
when is your book signing ?
1975 ?
it &apos;s a hell of a character .
they taught him how to kill ,
but he never learned to love !
no , no , no , no , no . wait , wait . okay .
daddies ! daddies ! the tooth fairy came .
what ? no way !
oh , that &apos;s so exciting !
what &apos;d she bring you ?
oh ! fairy dust . nice touch .
oh , my gosh , it &apos;s a lot .
some stickers ...
a toothbrush ...
and a hundred dollar bill !
what ? okay .
look at that .
i love the tooth fairy .
the tooth fairy gave our daughter $ 100 .
does she not know that the going rate for a tooth is $ 5 at the most ?
well , obviously , the tooth fairy made a mistake .
maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause the tooth fairy
had a little too much chardonnay last night .
i think the tooth fairy can handle the chardonnay .
what i don &apos;t think she can handle
is criticizing someone who made an honest mistake
in the dark of the night .
i &apos;m gonna put this in my clutch .
i can &apos;t wait to tell everyone at school !
okay , we cannot be the parents of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old
who gets $ 100 from the tooth fairy .
it &apos;s bad enough we &apos;re the parents of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a clutch .
you know , that bag transitions from day to night seamlessly ,
and i no longer have to carry crayons in my front pocket .
can &apos;t have this argument again !
thank you , dr. ann ,
for showing us how exciting and surprising
a real live therapy session can be .
i will hold on to this card .
next up , we have luke &apos;s dad , mr. dunphy .
hey . thank you .
guess what ?
i &apos;ve been in your house when you weren &apos;t home .
and yours . and yours .
no , i &apos;m not a burglar . i &apos;m a realtor .
ho ! hey , sorry i &apos;m late !
i just sold another mansion .
how you doin &apos; , honey ?
history is full of great rivalries--
athens and sparta , kerrigan and harding ,
phil dunphy and gil thorpe .
in this scenario , he &apos;s the tonya , i &apos;m the nancy .
pay attention , kids .
you &apos;re about to hear from the number four realtor in town .
anyway , uh , i &apos;m not gonna bore you guys with a lecture .
instead , i &apos;d like you to watch
as i converse with a young man
who &apos;s wondering what to do with his life .
hey , kid .
hey , kid , up here ! up here !
yo , dude ! whassup ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s up .
i &apos;m interested in helping you
by telling you all about a career in real estate .
real estate ? isn &apos;t that just buying and selling houses ?
i don &apos;t have time for that . epic fail .
sounds like we need to start at the beginning .
you see , real estate is about people .
people ?
couldn &apos;t agree more , phil . best part of our job
is putting the right person in the right home .
gil ...
matter of fact , last week ,
i put a &quot; spanish &quot; couple into
a spanish home .
gil .
a world without houses ? that &apos;s cray cray .
okay . okay .
phil , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to screw up your little show .
i know timing is critical on these things .
gil , please .
believe me , the last thing i want to do is ...
you sold a house to the channel 7 weatherman ?
no . no .
but i did sell one to kobe bryant .
what ? ! guess what ? he &apos;s not talking to you . he &apos;s talking to me .
and i have a very funny story , actually .
a guy walks into ... no .
that &apos;s hilarious .
no ! i haven &apos;t told it !
okay , um ... oh !
great throw . you were right .
it is in my court .
ball &apos;s in your court !
but guess what-- it was me the whole time .
what ? !
come on , kids , come on .
give it up ! give it up ! he tried .
i think we all know what you were going for , phil .
but i &apos;m lookin &apos; out here , and i &apos;m seeing some hungry kids .
am i right ? that &apos;s why i brought plenty of ...
gil pickles !
who wants a gil pickle ?
come on . let me see &apos; em .
all right . come on . grab one .
gil pickles .
genius .
so much better than my phil @-@ low cases .
claire wasn &apos;t a fan .
one of him in bed is more than enough .
do you hear that , ladies ?
all right . just hit &quot; send . &quot;
hey ! you just sold a house !
and you &apos;re gonna be chasing that high for the rest of your life .
give her a round of applause , everybody .
she just sold a house .
i wanna thank you kids for having me here today .
and remember the three rules of real estate--
thorpe , thorpe , thorpe !
thank you , mr. thorpe .
it turns out we have a little extra time .
uh , mrs. dunphy ?
yes ?
i &apos;m sure the class would love to hear from you .
oh , no . i just came in to help my husband .
i &apos;m a ... i &apos;m a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom .
i know . and that &apos;s a very important job .
it is . uh , yeah .
i can--i can do this for a minute .
um , stay @-@ at @-@ home mom .
uh , what that means is i actually have
a whole bunch of different jobs .
i am a chauffeur , a chef ,
uh , a house manager ,
a nurse .
is it what you always wanted to do ?
no . not exactly .
uh , i went to college , uh , to study marketing
and worked at one of those big hotel companies .
but when my kids came along ,
i just wanted to be there .
you know , wipe their noses and change their diapers
and tuck &apos; em in at night .
mom !
for the record , i do all my own wiping .
so why haven &apos;t you gone back to work ?
i &apos;ve done a few things lately . i just redid a house ,
and i ran for city council last year .
you &apos;re on the city council ?
no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t win .
you lost ?
that &apos;s what &quot; didn &apos;t win &quot; means .
i ... i thought i would be going back to work
when the kids got older ,
but it--it &apos;s not as easy as you might think .
you know , people aren &apos;t exactly lining up
to hire a woman who &apos;s almost 40
and has been out of the job market for 15 years .
i thought you were 42 .
that &apos;s almost 40 , luke .
my mom went back to work when i was 4 .
oh , so there was no one at home to teach you not to interrupt ?
okay . hey , hey , hey !
let me tell you something .
stay @-@ at @-@ home moms are heroes .
yeah .
they &apos;re the backbone of this country .
thanks , gil .
i mean , if i had to do that job ,
i &apos;d probably drink myself to death , honestly .
all right , let &apos;s give her a round of applause , everybody .
come on .
oh , come on , you can do better than that . let me hear ya !
all right ! all right !
all right , class dismissed . get out of here !
no !
no , no , no .
we have ... guys , we have three more hours .
here .
my old typewriter .
you said you want to write . write .
now ? i &apos;ve got a busy day .
i already called your office
and told them that you can &apos;t come in
to walk around for 20 minutes
saying to everyone , &quot; what &apos;s up , sport ? &quot;
i know this is your subtle little way
of saying you don &apos;t think i can do it .
no . it &apos;s life getting out of the way .
fine . i &apos;m gonna take you up on your little challenge ,
but you should know this--
this behavior of yours is not gonna fly
when you lose your looks .
you &apos;re gonna be long gone by then .
dunphy .
yeah ? oh .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t let that little smart @-@ ass bother you , all right .
have you seen her mother ? does not age well .
well , um , thanks for rescuing me in there .
and tell phil i &apos;m sorry
if i threw him off in there .
i probably should learn just to keep my big blowhole shut .
actually , it went a little better than it did in rehearsal ,
to be honest .
but i will tell him what you said .
all right .
you know , your little meltdown in there got me thinking .
i &apos;m building a retail office development ,
and i could use a liaison
to work with the planning commission .
are you offering me a job ?
well , yeah . you know people in city hall ,
and you did a hell of a job on that flip .
and for the safety of you and your family ,
i gotta get you out of that house .
but you and phil are competitors . it--
not on this .
look , if this works out , everybody &apos;s gonna win ...
except for that tropical fish store we &apos;re booting out of there .
i don &apos;t feel bad about that at all .
can i take a couple of days to think about it ?
yeah . yeah . take your time . no pressure .
okay .
and when you &apos;re ready , just give me a call .
okay .
number &apos;s on the stick .
great . oh , yeah . okay . gil pickle .
see ya ! thorpe ! thorpe ! thorpe !
thorpe . thorpe . thorpe .
look what just came in the mail--
a letter addressed to you , lily .
really ? i don &apos;t get much mail .
oh , let &apos;s see here .
uh , yeah . oh , the tooth fairy .
&quot; 1 tooth fairy lane . tooth city , tooth dakota . &quot;
i hope it &apos;s another $ 100 .
ooh ! well , lookie there .
glitter !
i guess the tooth fairy doesn &apos;t have to worry about vacuuming .
see , &quot; dear lily , i &apos;m writing because i made a mistake &quot;
&quot; and gave you too much money . &quot;
&quot; please leave the $ 100 under your pillow tonight , &quot;
&quot; and i &apos;ll give you a dollar .
sorry if that bites . &quot;
let me see that .
i can &apos;t read .
uh , well , it sounds like she &apos;s really in a jam .
and i think we &apos;re gonna
have to give the tooth fairy her $ 100 back .
no ! i wanna keep it .
i &apos;m scared that she &apos;s gonna be the one
taking care of us when we &apos;re older .
yeah .
&quot; chuck stone , &quot;
&quot; 6 @-@ foot , 3 @-@ inches of steely eyed determination &quot;
&quot; sat at the interrogation table . &quot;
&quot; his mind was a blank ... &quot;
&quot; a complete blank .
&quot; he literally could not think of one single , solitary thing .
&quot; then he noticed a spot . &quot;
&quot; it looked like syrup left over from breakfast ... &quot;
&quot; which made him realize it was lunchtime . &quot;
&quot; a bacon , lettuce , and tomato , sandwich-- &quot;
&quot; or b.l.t , as chuck stone called it--
&quot; would really hit the spot . &quot;
&quot; the secret , chuck realized , was real mayonnaise ... &quot;
&quot; not that healthy crap his wife kept buying for their son . &quot;
damn it !
&quot; i mean , what &apos;s the point of t @-@ t @-@ t @-@ t @-@ t @-@ t @-@ t ? &quot;
&quot; tea for two . two for tea . &quot;
it only gets worse from here .
you can &apos;t be serious !
gil thorpe is my nemesis !
i hate to break it to you , phil ,
but you &apos;re not batman .
trust me .
gil &apos;s a snake and he &apos;s found the perfect way to mess with me .
did it ever occur to you that he was hiring me because of ...
i don &apos;t know ? me .
are you kidding ? what &apos;s your last name ? !
right now ?
i &apos;m sorry , claire .
i @-@ i hate to do this , but i have to use my veto .
veto ? oh , you don &apos;t get any vetoes .
you veto me all the time .
&apos;cause you have dumb ideas .
name one .
that went on for a while .
... and let &apos;s not forget shower snacks .
i can &apos;t be the only one who gets hungry in there !
hey , jay . my mom said you were writing a book .
that &apos;s fantastic .
by the way , career day was a little weird .
i think claire &apos;s going through some pretty dark stuff ,
and you might want to check ...
enough chitchat .
i &apos;ve gotta get a character out of a bind .
ooh . what did he do ?
he told his wife he could write a book .
don &apos;t give up , jay . self @-@ doubt is part of the process .
you can &apos;t be a good writer
without being critical of your own work .
what ?
i &apos;m racking my brain for a compliment here .
i know . it stinks .
and your mom &apos;s gonna rub it in my face pretty good .
okay . why is chuck stone interrogating this guy ?
he needs the codes . if he doesn &apos;t get &apos; em ,
the international space station &apos;s gonna
crash into times square on new year &apos;s eve .
so he &apos;s short of time .
he &apos;s got about two minutes . he &apos;s desperate .
how about this ?
&quot; chuck stone smiled and lit a cigarette , &quot;
&quot; as if he had all the time in the world , &quot;
when in fact , the world was about to end . &quot;
holy crap . what happens next ?
move over . i &apos;ll type .
some coffee would be great . thanks .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand why
we don &apos;t just go in there ,
we tell her we &apos;re taking the money , and that &apos;s that .
because this is a teaching moment ,
and we want her to want to give the money back .
i &apos;m just really worried
we &apos;re becoming those overindulgent parents right now .
don &apos;t be silly .
okay , you ready , tooth fairy ?
let &apos;s do this .
all right .
lily , look who came to say hi !
it &apos;s me , the tooth fairy .
and i &apos;ve come to ask you for a favor !
are you really the tooth fairy ?
oh , yes , i am . look at my wings !
can you fly ? i wanna see you fly .
well , i can &apos;t right now because ...
well , because--
because the tooth fairy &apos;s too sad to fly ...
because she made a mistake that only you can make better .
is this about the money again ?
well , yes , it is .
i need enough for all the other children &apos;s tooths .
teeth .
wait a minute .
you &apos;re not the tooth fairy . you &apos;re haley .
no ! i am the tooth fairy !
look ! fairy dust !
and there &apos;s that glitter .
why did you lie ?
you said lying was wrong .
we also said that when someone is in trouble , you help them .
how do i know you weren &apos;t lying ?
she is good .
all right , lily , this is ridiculous .
all right , the tooth fairy has made a mistake .
you need to put the $ 100 under the pillow ,
and that is the end of the story .
because you believe it &apos;s the right thing to do ...
yes .
don &apos;t you ?
but i wanna buy a scooter .
oh . that &apos;s what i &apos;d do .
i mean ...
who cares what santa thinks , right ?
santa ?
well , he sees everything ,
and this &apos;ll probably put you on the &quot; naughty &quot; list .
but who needs presents every year ?
you &apos;ve got a hundred dollars .
you can ride around that empty christmas tree
until you &apos;re an old lady .
can i have some time to think about it ?
you don &apos;t need any ...
of course , sweetie .
yeah . okay .
haley ? okay , that was brilliant .
thanks . oh , also , can i borrow this ?
why ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
you know , after i put on the wig ,
i just ... i felt like the character .
hang on .
yell @-@ o ?
quick question . am i talking to live phil or video phil ?
what do you want , gil ?
i just wanna make sure it &apos;s okay that your wife calls me &quot; boss . &quot;
good @-@ bye .
oh , hold on ! hold on !
i &apos;m just messing with ya .
although i do think
your wife &apos;s gonna enjoy being under me .
my son is in the car .
hey , superstar ! what &apos;s up ?
listen , any time you wanna swing by the beach house ,
i &apos;ll be glad to show you how to throw a tight spiral
like i did at texas tech . booyah !
tommy !
he already knows how to throw .
yeah , my gay uncle cam taught me .
i @-@ i got this .
this was between us . you don &apos;t bring family into it .
low blow getting claire &apos;s hopes up .
hey , i &apos;m not getting her hopes up .
this is a real job with real bennies--
one of which is
i get to tell you what i &apos;m thinking
whenever she leans over my desk !
oh , i &apos;m gonna have so much fun with this !
later , dunph @-@ bags !
what a jerk .
you know what ? we &apos;re gonna tell your mom
before she goes into business with this guy .
he &apos;s gil @-@ ty of being a thorpe in my side .
trying too hard .
yeah .
hello !
move !
you &apos;re fine .
so ?
how was your first day of writing ?
gloria , shh ! let me finish one thought .
got it .
so you actually wrote something ?
well , it was slow going at first ,
but then the juices started flowing .
may i ?
sure .
uh , if it helps , picture tom berenger .
i always do .
what ?
well , it &apos;s just this ...
this first sentence is a bit long .
long or dynamic ?
no , long and confusing . i can &apos;t tell who &apos;s talking .
maybe that &apos;s just to mimic the fog of battle .
okay .
what now ?
just ... there were no cell phones in 1965 .
that &apos;s a mistake . i &apos;m changing that .
you can &apos;t change that . it comes back in the end ...
i @-@ i presume .
the point is , i can write .
i probably won &apos;t pursue it ,
but it &apos;s a viable career option .
the cia had all sorts of top @-@ secret technology .
who &apos;s to say they didn &apos;t have cell phones ?
manny , let it go .
and this chuck stone--
he doesn &apos;t seem very good at his job .
he &apos;s flawed . that &apos;s what makes the character interesting .
if you want someone perfect , put in a robot .
a robot !
i like a robot .
no ! you &apos;re not putting a robot in my story !
that &apos;s right , my story .
you must be very happy .
i would be , but life got in the way .
what are you doing ?
oh , i just got out my old briefcase .
it &apos;s still capable of doing the job ,
just like me .
claire , you have to understand something .
you have to understand something .
i walked around all day on cloud nine
because somebody valued me .
i value you . we all value you .
no , of course you do ,
because i cook and i clean and i pick up dirty underwear .
no , honey , it &apos;s different than that .
i have been on the sidelines for so long ,
i didn &apos;t know if anybody would ever think
i have what it takes again .
i know gil &apos;s not the greatest guy ,
but this is important . and i think--
i think you should take the job .
but , dad ...
no , luke . she &apos;s right .
your mom &apos;s gonna be amazing at this .
i retract my veto .
you never had a veto .
yes , i did .
no , you didn &apos;t , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and that went on for a while .
... and lastly , this whole conversation would be happening
in a yurt .
it &apos;s the perfect structure .
i have to go take the shoulder pads out of all my old suits !
you know he &apos;s gonna keep teasing you .
if it makes your mom happy , i can handle a few phone calls .
and texts .
what does it say ?
nothing i can &apos;t handle .
&quot; we all weave a web of lies . &quot;
&quot; some we tell to try to help the ones we love . &quot;
&quot; some we tell to try to fool ourselves . &quot;
&quot; and some we tell because ,
when you &apos;re out of bullets
and staring down the barrel of a kalashnikov ,
the only weapon you &apos;ve got left is guile . &quot;
she &apos;s nuts . that &apos;s fantastic .
okay , guys , bring it in !
let &apos;s get this place shipshape before she gets home .
i &apos;m sure she had a big first day .
haley , i &apos;m putting you on laundry .
alex , kitchen and vacuum .
luke , you &apos;re cleaning the bathroom .
why me ?
because you always mess it up .
yeah , why can &apos;t you pee straight ?
hey , i &apos;m doing a great job from that far back .
okay , guys , team dunphy on three .
one , two--that &apos;s right , we got a lot to do !
honey , what are you doing home so early ?
i quit . that man is a complete pig .
he treated me like a servant
and showed me absolutely no respect .
i &apos;m so sorry . you deserve better than that .
i do .
so what &apos;s for dinner ?
i feel like you heard me wrong . i said , what &apos;s for dinner ?
i heard you !
