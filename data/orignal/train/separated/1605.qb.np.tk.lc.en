i love you .
i love you too .
we heard from robin . she &apos;s recommending your adoption .
you &apos;re officially a member of the adams foster family .
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
that &apos;s joe olsen ,
the son of the owner of the s.u.v. that hit the kids .
didn &apos;t you say the guy on the bus was black ?
but if joe lends his father &apos;s car to the guy ,
hits ana and the twins in the volvo ,
and takes off ?
you have an interesting theory .
i cheated on my boyfriend . i have to live with that .
a.j.
hey , grandma .
that &apos;s mike . he &apos;s my new foster father .
are you having an affair with monte ?
no , she kissed me .
surprise .
jesus .
i had to get a second mammogram .
they saw something in the first one .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a bat signal .
why are you sending connor away ?
connor asked to go live with his mom .
the composer who will be performing at disney hall is brandon foster .
oh , i &apos;ll come back .
no , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m just getting ready .
so , you excited ?
oh , come on . you &apos;re gonna do great .
but i know the feeling . i hate speaking in public .
just don &apos;t forget to breathe , &apos; cause i actually ...
i threw up last night before the concert .
you did ?
yeah .
well , you killed it .
what , you don &apos;t think it went well ?
no , no , we rocked it , for sure .
but this professor from juilliard ,
after the concert , invited me
to their final callbacks in new york .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
okay , so why aren &apos;t you freaking out right now ?
because i looked it up
and it &apos;s , like , 40,000 a year . and that &apos;s just tuition .
yikes .
yeah .
well , we have the college fund
that grandma sharon set up for us .
that &apos;s not even gonna cover a year .
okay , you can &apos;t worry about that right now ,
&apos;cause , you know , if you get in ,
you never know what will happen .
you should go tell moms . they &apos;re gonna flip .
hey , how &apos;s a.j. ?
sad .
i mean , other than his brother ,
she was the only family he had , so ...
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s all just packed up ,
just like that . it &apos;s like she wasn &apos;t even ever here .
they need the room , you know ,
for somebody else &apos;s grandma .
i talked to the funeral home
and everything &apos;s taken care of .
what ?
what do you mean ?
nothing .
just whatever your grandmother &apos;s insurance doesn &apos;t cover , i got it .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i want to .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna get this box out to the car .
leave your name at the beep .
hey , it &apos;s foster . listen ,
if you haven &apos;t run the prints on that pen yet ,
don &apos;t bother . the lead &apos;s dried up .
okay ? thanks .
you look nice .
oh , thank you .
you put that on for monte ?
stef ...
we talked about this .
you said you were okay with me going back to work .
yes , and i ... i am .
i kind of have to be , don &apos;t i ?
are you sure about that ?
i am .
you remember what we said in the garage ... no more half @-@ truths .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
oh my god .
what ?
what ?
the insurance company is refusing to pay for my second mammogram .
you are kidding me .
well , it &apos;s only $ 300,
but with all of jesus &apos;s plane tickets
and callie and jude &apos;s legal bills , it &apos;s just ...
you know , we &apos;re starting to get a little behind , i think .
it &apos;s making my head hurt .
hey , ma .
good morning .
good morning , sharon .
where have you been ?
oh , i was just ... i was taking a walk .
this early ?
yeah , you know ,
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m still on east coast time .
and in your slippers ? that &apos;s interesting .
no , i just ... i forgot my comfy shoes .
relax , columbo .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
what &apos;s that ?
just ... it &apos;s ...
the insurance company doesn &apos;t want to pay for my mammogram .
what ? why not ?
well , because i already had one , and they wanted to re @-@ image .
but that is fine . everything &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine .
please don &apos;t make a big deal out of it . here we go .
wait a minute , sister . listen , you need a second opinion .
no , it was a second opinion , mom .
that was , so ...
did you talk to the radiologist ?
no , i didn &apos;t , but you know how it goes .
they read the thing , and then the tech comes in and tells you
that you &apos;re fine . and i am . i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just fine .
no , no .
no , no , what ?
stef , we need to talk about this .
no , there &apos;s nothing to talk about , mom .
please .
no need to go through other people &apos;s mail !
you &apos;re not other people .
you &apos;re my daughter .
do you have a minute ?
thanks you for sitting down with me .
now that the school year &apos;s starting again ,
i just thought it was important for me to apologize face to face .
i realize i &apos;ve put us all in a difficult position .
yes , you have .
i want you to know i &apos;m not proud of what i said ...
or did .
but mostly i came here to say ,
if you want me to resign from anchor beach , i will .
and that is why i started fost and found .
so that foster kids can find valuable resources ,
but more importantly , so they can find each other .
because we all need a sense of community .
and if we ever want change to happen ,
there needs to be a place to speak up ,
to come forward and tell our stories ...
do you think that girl is for real ?
that girl is my sister .
trust me , she &apos;s for real .
... even if it makes people uncomfortable or mad .
because there &apos;s no way
they &apos;re gonna fix these problems if they don &apos;t know ...
so what do you think about what monte said ?
i mean , how can we expect a bunch of lawmakers
and social workers to know what we &apos;re really going through
when they &apos;re not living our lives ?
the only way real change can happen is if we demand it .
hey , aren &apos;t you ...
why aren &apos;t you in colorado ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not going back .
why not ?
because he &apos;s flunking out .
mariana .
well , aren &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t flunk out . i was just having
kind of a hard time with the classes there .
but i &apos;d prefer it if , you know , everybody didn &apos;t know about it .
so could you shut your trap for once ?
fine .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re making posters for my campaign .
campaign ? for what ?
junior class president . emma &apos;s my campaign manager .
really ? why would you want to do that ?
it &apos;s so lame .
jesus .
junior year is , like , the most important year for colleges .
i have to totally kill it this year
if i want to get into a good school ,
and not just academically . i need , like , a full resume
of extracurricular activities , so ...
oh , sorry . you were so boring , i fell asleep .
wha ... ? hi .
what the hell ?
lexi ?
ah ! hi ! oh my god .
what are you doing here ? i just talked to you a couple days ago .
i &apos;m back . we &apos;re back .
what ? how ?
we got our visas .
and the first thing my mom did was call your mom
to make sure that i can come back to anchor beach .
you &apos;re coming back ?
but i made her swear to secrecy , so that i could surprise you .
oh my god .
oh my god , oh my god , oh my god , oh my god .
oh . hey , emma .
wow , it &apos;s like an ex @-@ girlfriend convention in here .
want me to call hayley ? maybe she can come over .
and you have to tell everyone how they &apos;re selling kids
into these privatized foster homes .
yeah , i know about these places .
my friend kiara was in one of them .
then why aren &apos;t you saying anything about it ?
i ... i will .
but maybe you could post on &quot; fost and found , &quot; get people talking ?
i ... i can &apos;t .
my foster family already hates me .
what if they saw it ?
so have you spoken to your social worker ?
she doesn &apos;t care , okay ?
she works for the company .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry , but i need to steal callie for a minute .
you looked like you might need a little saving .
thank you .
oh , forgive me . i &apos;m justina marks .
i &apos;m a foster care advocate ,
and i have a proposition i hope you &apos;re gonna like .
i have $ 50,000 i &apos;d like to invest in you .
so did you guys come to a ... ?
well , we spoke and ...
we both have decided that it would be best if you stayed .
really ?
yes .
but i want to be really clear :
we are not friends .
we are colleagues , nothing more .
my wife is being incredibly understanding and trusting ,
and i think the least we can do
is respect appropriate boundaries .
absolutely .
yes , absolutely .
my dad has a meeting or something when we get back ,
so now we leave a day early .
well , that sucks .
yeah .
wow , you &apos;re taking everything , huh ?
i &apos;m gonna be back in a month , to see my dad .
and my mom said you can visit whenever you want .
okay .
you know , school &apos;s not gonna be the same without you .
nothing is .
jude .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i want to stay .
really , i do .
but you gotta understand ...
my dad ... he &apos;s never gonna change .
seen mike ?
uh , no , he went to get coffee .
you want to get this to him for me ?
yeah , sure .
what is it ?
he told me not to bother ,
but i had already run the prints .
turns out they do match the ones from the s.u.v.
so looks like maybe you got your guy .
nice work .
what the hell is this ?
whose prints are on this pen , mike ?
from mission beach elder care , huh ?
is it a.j. &apos; s ? is this where his grandmother is ?
is that why you were telling me to let this go ? because tell me ...
no . no , stef . it &apos;s not a.j.
it &apos;s his brother ty .
what ?
look ,
we were at the nursing home ,
and this kid came up to pick up ty .
and i thought i recognized him .
and i went over to take a closer look ,
and it was joe olsen .
yeah , yeah , turns out your way out theory ... not so way out .
so i ran the prints on the pen that ty used to sign in .
wade just said that you told him not to bother .
you planning on burying this , mike ?
look , stef , we don &apos;t know anything for sure .
no , no , no , no , these prints match .
we have a witness who can i.d. him .
you &apos;re kidding me .
stef ...
what about a.j. ? i &apos;m just getting through to him .
he &apos;s starting to trust me .
what do you think is gonna happen
if i arrest the only family he &apos;s got left ?
what about my family ... our family ,
all the people you love ...
jesus and mariana , ana , the baby ?
what about all the pain they &apos;ve been through , mike ?
can we at least wait till after the funeral ?
please .
look , it &apos;s in a few days . nobody knows anything .
you cannot tell a.j. he &apos;s gonna tell his brother ,
and he &apos;s gone , and you know it .
i &apos;m not stupid .
fine . i have to go .
hey there .
so you &apos;re back , huh ?
yeah .
can you believe it ?
remember all the times we used to make out in here ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
so you &apos;re not seeing emma anymore ?
no , no .
we ended things a long time ago .
i &apos;m not seeing anyone ...
actually .
well , me neither .
good to know .
well , first of all , you two are raising
an amazing young woman here .
thank you . we certainly think so .
and i think you &apos;re in a position to become the spokesperson
the foster community has been waiting for .
and i can get you in front of the people
who need to hear your message , and i have the resources
you &apos;re gonna need to expand &quot; foster and found . &quot;
this all sounds really exciting ,
but this is callie &apos;s senior year in high school .
she &apos;s really got a lot on her plate .
do you know about privatized homes ?
these companies are getting paid fees from the state
every time they place a child with a family .
so the more kids they place , the more money they make ,
which means that some companies are ,
like , pretty much taking anyone who &apos;s willing to foster .
is there something we could do about that ?
absolutely . absolutely .
i mean , there is so much that needs to be addressed ,
but i think the most important thing for us to do right now
is to look at the big picture .
yeah , it &apos;s just
there was this kid at the event today
who &apos;s in one of those homes .
look , i know how hard it must be to have all these kids
reaching out to you , hearing all of their heartbreaking stories .
but , i mean , you can &apos;t trust every kid
who comes knocking at your door , asking for help .
i mean , you have to be careful .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
i know that .
there was just something about him .
he reminded me a little bit of my brother .
give me his name . i &apos;ll make some calls .
uh , it was jack downey , i think .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
hey , mom .
where are you going ?
you startled me . i was just taking a walk .
another one ?
gotta get my steps in .
so which picture should i use ?
that one .
that one .
the left one , definitely .
you like someone who can really get things done .
yeah , like put people to sleep .
i say right . you look super hot .
but i &apos;m not your campaign manager , so ...
that &apos;s right . you &apos;re not .
yeah ... no , i know .
but , you know , lexi &apos;s just trying to help ,
and i think she kind of does have a point .
we can &apos;t be boring .
i don &apos;t think smart is boring .
i don &apos;t think that caring about what matters is boring .
i don &apos;t think that you need to be silly and stupid to be sexy .
but if that &apos;s the kind of campaign that you want to run ,
then maybe i &apos;m not the girl for the job .
i should probably get home anyway .
talk to you later .
she &apos;s intense .
yeah .
but she &apos;s right .
i think i should stick with emma as my campaign manager ...
just emma .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re back ,
but i think it &apos;s best
if i just have one vision , you know ?
okay .
got it .
sorry .
no hard feelings ?
yeah .
no , no hard feelings .
thank you for sitting down to talk to me .
i think we could do wonderful things together , callie .
so you &apos;ll think about what i said ?
yeah , yeah .
okay , bye .
bye .
hey , i need you find out where jack downey &apos;s been placed .
it &apos;s important .
mom .
open ...
police ! open up !
i can hear you in there .
hi , stefanie . how are you ?
what the hell is going on , mom ?
oh , this is will ...
my boyfriend .
what &apos;s up ?
i mean really , what &apos;s going on mom ?
why on earth would you not want to introduce us to your boyfriend ?
i mean it &apos;s not that serious , really .
it &apos;s just you know , kind of a fling ,
because you know he &apos;s young .
i &apos;m not buying that , mom .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want us to meet him
because he &apos;s young and hot ?
wait he &apos;s not homophobic , is he ?
he &apos;d better not be homophobic .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , of course not .
i would never even date somebody ...
i would hope not .
who wouldn &apos;t like you because you &apos;re a lesbian .
actually i was a little afraid
that he might like you because you &apos;re a cop .
what ?
well he &apos;s just , he &apos;s not a fan of big government ,
or a big fan of government period .
he &apos;s just ...
wow , my mother &apos;s dating an anarchist .
that &apos;s brilliant .
what can i tell you ?
you know the heart wants what it wants , and the sex is just ...
oh mom i don &apos;t want to hear it .
you &apos;re such a prude really .
you raised me . please help me .
we need to make a decision about jesus .
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not what do we do , you know ?
do we let him stay home because he &apos;s homesick ?
yes , you should let him stay .
mother , i didn &apos;t ask you .
i &apos;m just saying .
of course i feel for him ,
but i think that we should make him go back ,
honor his commitment .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna work .
so you &apos;re flunking out huh ?
i &apos;m gonna kill mariana .
i ... i guess i was just embarrassed , you know ?
i didn &apos;t want you guys to be ashamed of me .
well , that makes sense .
yeah .
except for the fact that after we spoke with mariana ,
i called flintwood . they said you &apos;re doing fine .
better than fine , actually .
so what the hell is going on ?
i didn &apos;t want to tell you guys this , but ...
some of the kids on the team take steroids ,
and they were pressuring me to take them too ,
so we could be , you know the strongest team possible .
and these kids , they &apos;re really good ,
like way better than me .
so i did it for a few days ,
but i hated how they made me feel , and i stopped .
but here &apos;s the thing i can &apos;t go back
unless i want to keep taking steroids , and i don &apos;t .
the only way for me to stop is if i tell coach ,
and then i &apos;m ratting out on everyone
and the guys on the team are gonna destroy me .
well so i guess he &apos;s going back to anchor beach , huh ?
no , he &apos;s not .
there &apos;s a waiting list , and he &apos;s not on it .
i &apos;m sorry about your grandma .
she seemed really cool .
well i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call her cool ,
but she was pretty great .
well you still have ty , that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m sorry i missed your speech thing .
how did it go ?
okay i guess .
afterwards this woman came up to me
and told me that she wants to invest in &quot; fost and found , &quot;
and she wants me to be like ,
a spokesperson or something .
what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t really think i &apos;m cut out to be like a role model you know ?
why not ?
why can &apos;t you be a role model ?
in the comic books , it &apos;s always the people
you never think could do it who turn out to be the hero .
i mean , what if peter parker
didn &apos;t want to be spider @-@ man after he got bit ?
it &apos;s too bad , you know ?
it &apos;s just sometimes it &apos;s meant to be ,
super callie .
so listen , there &apos;s this comic convention next weekend .
comicon ?
no , this is smaller .
okay .
it &apos;s more indie . it &apos;s really cool .
and i was wondering
if maybe
you wanted to go with me ?
hey , good news .
i just got a call from the weavers .
their son got into hilldale prep ,
and he won &apos;t be returning this year ,
so there &apos;s an opening in the junior class .
there &apos;s also a waiting list ,
and i just don &apos;t feel comfortable .
look , no one will ever know .
frankly , it &apos;s not up to you . i &apos;m the principal .
jesus was a student here last year ,
and i &apos;m thrilled he &apos;ll be joining us again tomorrow .
what is that kid doing here ?
i invited him .
why ?
well i mean my boyfriend is moving to l.a. ,
so i figured i &apos;d better make some new friends ,
if that &apos;s okay with you .
where have you been ?
i went to see a.j.
nice of you .
so if you and a.j. are like ,
hanging out , dating or whatever ,
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s fine .
but can we make a deal ?
if either of us starts seeing someone ,
can we just tell each other , okay ?
just so we don &apos;t have to find out about it from someone else .
okay .
okay .
what did moms say about juilliard ?
oh , i actually ...
i haven &apos;t had the chance to tell them yet .
they &apos;re gonna be really happy for you . i promise .
hello .
hey , grandma .
actually , can i ask you something ?
uh , you made a lot of money with the stock market , right ?
who wants to know ?
well , i think it &apos;s gonna be lovely , gentlemen .
i promise we &apos;re going to do right by your grandmother .
and so the only thing left to attend to
is the matter of the bill .
uh , that &apos;s me .
shall we ...
of course .
should be a nice service .
look , i know you miss her . i miss her too .
it ain &apos;t that .
what then ?
i gotta go , dude . i gotta get out of here .
soon as the funeral &apos;s over , i gotta hit the road .
wait , hold up , why ?
look , the cops have been coming around .
what the hell did you do , ty ?
i borrowed a car from a buddy of mine ,
you know , the day i was supposed to come meet you .
i got into this accident ...
a bad one .
i almost killed some people ,
and i just panicked and i ran .
now the cops are coming around and asking all these questions .
i gotta go , before they start to figure everything out .
i probably should have told you before ,
but i can &apos;t be hanging around .
where ... where ... where was the accident ?
mission and &quot; e. &quot;
what kind of car was it that you hit ?
i don &apos;t know .
green maybe , or blue . i took off so quick .
a volvo , ty ? was it a vvolvo ?
it could have been . it was like a station wagon .
why ?
because it was the fosters .
those people you almost killed ... it was mariana and jesus .
it was the family i &apos;ve been staying with .
does mike know ?
about the accident ? yeah .
but he doesn &apos;t know it was you ,
or else he would have arrested your ass .
i gotta go . i gotta go tonight .
either you &apos;re coming with me ,
or you ain &apos;t never gonna see me again .
so i just ... i don &apos;t know how i feel
about letting jesus jump the line .
you know , if someone found out and made a fuss ,
we could lose the charter .
but i don &apos;t think that anyone &apos;s gonna know .
and , you know , honestly , you have done so much for that school
that i think it &apos;s okay if you take a little something in return .
listen , i had a very interesting conversation
with brandon this afternoon .
he wanted to know if i would invest the $ 7,500
that he has left over from his hand money .
he did ? why ?
it seems that he has been invited
for the final callbacks for juilliard ,
but he doesn &apos;t think he should even try
because he doesn &apos;t think you could possibly afford it .
now i just didn &apos;t have the heart to tell him
that i didn &apos;t think even i could turn $ 7500
into $ 150,000 in a year .
hello .
yes , this is she .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. who &apos;s office ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i never sent my mammogram over to a dr. kopak .
actually , you did .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back , be ...
okay .
okay , thank you very much .
yes .
you had the radiologist send my film over to another doctor , mom ,
for a second second opinion ? really ?
maybe i did .
what ?
sharon .
how do you do that ? what , they can just let anybody
send my ... my ... my records around town ?
no , they have security questions .
they wanted to know your mother &apos;s maiden name .
took me a second , but then i remembered .
oh my god .
what ?
okay , just ...
honey , what did they say ?
they want me to come back
for an ultrasound , and possibly a biopsy .
oh , all right . so you &apos;ll go .
no , i &apos;m not going .
the doctors order these tests and these biopsies
and all this stuff to make money .
it &apos;s a racket . and i am fine .
so that &apos;s the end of the conversation .
well , i just can &apos;t decide
whether i want the lobster or the shrimp .
i think i might need a second opinion .
what do you think , lena ?
i think i &apos;m gonna get the steak ,
or crab , or both .
you &apos;re not gonna get both , jesus , come on .
don &apos;t be a pig . this place isn &apos;t cheap .
don &apos;t be silly . you can have whatever you want .
i &apos;m taking everybody to dinner tonight .
mom , that &apos;s not necessary .
no , i want to . i want to .
we &apos;re celebrating , aren &apos;t we ?
callie &apos;s adoption
and brandon &apos;s big debut at disney hall ,
and also the first day of school .
oh , yeah .
and we &apos;re also celebrating the fact
that brandon is headed to new york to audition for juilliard .
what ?
grandma told us what you talked to her about today .
if you get in , we &apos;ll figure it out , okay ?
i just want you to focus on your audition for now , okay ?
mama , you &apos;re gonna have four kids in college soon .
it &apos;s not all about me .
i gotta figure out a way to help , at least .
let &apos;s be honest ,
the industrial @-@ penal complex has to be fed .
what ?
he said , &quot; penal . &quot;
we arrest them . we throw away the key .
that is what police do .
they have a role to play , and that &apos;s what it is .
what about &quot; protect and serve &quot; ?
what about &quot; protect and serve &quot; ?
i mean , don &apos;t even get me started about police brutality
and racial profiling .
gosh , i am parched . where is that waitress ?
brandon , run over to that bar
and get me a champagne cocktail .
mom , you can &apos;t send a minor over to get an alcoholic drink .
oh , i think he &apos;s a major .
are you okay , bud ?
hey , i promise you &apos;re gonna see connor again , okay ?
yeah , i know .
it just won &apos;t be the same .
i &apos;m not sure i understand why he &apos;s going .
because ...
because his dad just doesn &apos;t get it .
and he never will .
what can i get you ?
um , a champagne cocktail .
um , can i see some i.d. ?
oh , it &apos;s not for me .
it &apos;s for my grandma .
okay .
what &apos;s that for ?
oh , we used to have somebody come play happy hours ,
but he was drunk all the time , so they fired him .
too bad too . tips were really good when he was here .
why ? you play ?
a little .
norman , this handsome dude was just asking
if we ever have anyone play that piano .
no , and we never will again .
sorry .
thanks .
here you go , grandma .
thank you .
so does it feel different ,
being adopted ?
yeah , kinda .
i finally feel safer .
must be nice .
it is , yeah .
honestly , the best part of it is knowing
that jude and i aren &apos;t gonna be separated again .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s hella good , is what it is .
hey , so that comic thing next weekend ...
i would love to go , if you still ...

you &apos;re now officially an administrator for &quot; fost and found . &quot;
the biopsy we did on your breast
shows that you have ductal carcinoma in situ .
which is ?
d.c.i.s. is the presence of abnormal cells
contained inside a milk duct in the breast .
so she ... she has cancer ?
she has what we call stage zero cancer .
i would recommend a lumpectomy ,

depending on whether we find any microinvasion in the margins .
without a family history of breast cancer ...
