gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
it &apos;s time to pass the &quot; gossip girl &quot; baton .
welcome to your future
as gossip girl 3.0 .
the power is now in your hands .
i told chuck he doesn &apos;t have my heart anymore .
i realized it belongs to someone else .
&quot; as for the rest of my estate , i leave to you , ivy dickens . &quot;
i think it would be best if you left .
i was just gonna say the same thing .
this is my apartment now .
i heard from ivy &apos;s lawyer .
she got a call from the bank ,
saying there was a cashier &apos;s check waiting for her .
do you know anything about this ?
it was a ruse to get her out of the apartment .
but you didn &apos;t just lie to her . you lied to me .
i will go back down and get mr. humphrey &apos;s bags .
well , um , actually , this is it for now .
i &apos;m ready to move on with my life ,
and i can &apos;t do that
with gossip girl tracking my every move .
find a new serena . use your influence
to anoint her the new &quot; it &quot; girl .
please tell me we have an offer
that &apos;ll at least keep &quot; the spectator &quot; afloat .
yes , i do know diana payne .
&quot; the spectator &quot; is yours .
i &apos;m just here in a support capacity . deal ?
deal .
they needed a family member for a blood transfusion ,
and i gave the doctors jack &apos;s number .
jack ?
you &apos;re covering for who really gave me the blood--
elizabeth .
she didn &apos;t want you to know ,
elizabeth is not your mother .
keep looking . someone donated that blood .
i wanna know who .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. gossip girl .
even on the upper east side ,
the laws of physics dictate that what goes up
must come down .
even when it feels as if
our feet are a million miles off the ground .
but when we &apos;ve hit rock bottom ,
we hope that some way , somehow ,
our fortunes will change ...
that a great force will reverse the trend .
sorry . did i wake you ?
it &apos;s after 9 : 00 .
yeah , that &apos;s dawn on the upper east side .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , remember how i called &quot; page six &quot; and perez hilton
&quot; trash @-@ filled rags for small @-@ minded individuals &quot; ?
yeah , i think i recall something along those lines .
well , i take it back . sort of .
i still think gossip sites are demonic ,
but even i have to admit that this whole &quot; it &quot; girl thing
has its perks .
oh , really ? like what ?
like ... lars von trier requesting me for an audition ?
he &apos;s doing a staging of &quot; dancer in the dark &quot; at the public .
no big whoop . i mean , he &apos;s only a bona fide film god .
that &apos;s fantastic .
when are we gonna celebrate ? i mean , i &apos;m free right now .
how about after my audition ?
it &apos;s today , and so i need every waking moment to prepare ,
which includes tracking down serena and getting her advice
on what to wear for my debut .
actually , she &apos;s been kind of distant lately .
i can &apos;t figure out why .
listen , just &apos; cause you &apos;re cousins
doesn &apos;t mean you have to be best friends .
my cousin tried to kill me .
okay , i gotta go . talk soon .
we have a very busy day ahead of us ,
so try to look alive .
we begin with--
just how lonely boy like--
over easy with croissant on side .
jam with four fruits , not plain strawberry .
thank you , dorota . you know me so well .
as i was saying ,
or at least attempting to say
before you two started chatting about condiments ,
we will be walking the red carpet
at opening night of &quot; end of the rainbow &quot; tonight--
our first public outing as a couple .
so i &apos;m scheduled for a photo facial at 10 : 00,
and then tracy anderson will be twisting my body
into positions you couldn &apos;t even imagine at 11 : 00 .
in the meantime , why don &apos;t you go home and shower ?
or ... not shower and just use deodorant
as people from brooklyn are wont to do .
we &apos;ll grab cocktails before curtain , 7 : 00 p.m. ,
where the red carpet , paparazzi , and at least
one stirring tale of alcoholism and financial ruin await us .
god . it &apos;s good to be back in the saddle .
sounds like a perfect plan .
of course it is . i came up with it .
so be on time .
are you sure it &apos;s okay if i borrow it ?
of course .
you have to wear the perfect thing ,
not just for the audition , but for all the people
that will be writing about you going to it .
you know , it &apos;s funny , the only person
who seems to not be writing about you these days
is gossip girl .
that doesn &apos;t bother me .
really ? i mean , she is the crown jewel of the new york gossip blogs .
maybe when you were in high school ,
but now it seems like she &apos;s kind of irrelevant .
oh , be careful what you say . she might be able to hear you .
this is the biggest audition of my life .
last thing i &apos;m worried about is some pathetic blogger
in a dark room tethered to a computer .
so are you nervous ?
petrified . von trier &apos;s a genius ,
but he &apos;s got a reputation
for being really tough on actresses .
personally , i think directors wield
a little bit too much power , so even if he &apos;s tough ,
no tears from me .
well , you seem so confident today ,
that nothing could make you cry , even if it should .
uh , well , thank you so much for this dress , serena .
i really appreciate it .
of course . break a leg .
thanks .
hmm . what &apos;s with the tie ?
oh , it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a blair thing .
i find it &apos;s best to pick my battles .
what &apos;s with the tool belt ?
oh , it &apos;s a handyman thing .
i can see that , and as happy as i am
to have a chair that finally rolls , uh ,
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time for you to head home ?
i am home .
no , i mean your other home-- the one with your wife in it .
usually , you two are the king and queen of reconciliation .
shouldn &apos;t you be forgiving each other right now
in the midst of a teary embrace ?
i know . i don &apos;t know how i let things get so out of hand .
fix &apos; em , like the chair .
it &apos;s not that simple . i feel as though lily and i
have stopped being honest with each other .
so tell her the truth .
well , that &apos;s the thing . i ...
i &apos;m not sure that i haven &apos;t been lying this whole time
to myself as much as to her .
i mean , when lily and i first got married ,
i threw myself into her world .
i became a plus one
at her galas and in life .
but in the process , i lost myself
and what &apos;s important to me .
we never managed to build a life together
that included both of us .
and i &apos;m tired of it .
but now you &apos;re living separately ,
stuck in a stalemate .
that isn &apos;t exactly the ideal alternative .
yeah , but at least i &apos;m regaining my identity .
i know you &apos;re happy with blair ,
and maybe in time , you &apos;ll learn to love wearing this tie .
but don &apos;t lose sight of yourself .
good morning .
late because of lola , i presume ?
i wish .
trouble in paradise ? i hope it isn &apos;t me .
it isn &apos;t .
good , &apos; cause that was a lie . i hope it is me .
i &apos;ve got a smile . watch out .
i may take it the wrong way . could be trouble .
oh , yeah , yeah , go ahead and pile it on .
no , there &apos;s just a lot going on right now .
my girlfriend is totally caught up in her new life .
serena and i are not on good terms .
i haven &apos;t seen dan in forever .
my best friend &apos;s on a mission
that i know is only gonna get him hurt .
chuck &apos;s on a mission ?
yeah , he &apos;s looking for a missing relative .
and if you have to look that hard ,
it &apos;s never the answer you wanna find .
you know , i better run .
i &apos;m gonna be late for my 11 : 00 .
jack , it &apos;s me .
i just heard from nate that chuck &apos;s still on the hunt .
we have to stop him snooping around ,
or sooner or later , he &apos;s going to find out the truth .
hang on .
serena is holding my site hostage .
if you don &apos;t get it back for me ,
i &apos;ll tell everyone the secret
that made you afraid of me in the first place .
hello .
i &apos;m lola rhodes . i &apos;m here to read for the part of--
your audition has been canceled .
what ? no , i got a call yesterday .
there must be some mistake . i don &apos;t understand .
oh , maybe this &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast
will help clarify it for you .
lola is a diva .
wannabe actress lola rhodes was overhead bragging ,
everyone knows the star &apos;s the thing .
real actors don &apos;t take direction .
some are just better at pretending they do .
you can go .
rufus ?
it seems i &apos;ve made too much salad .
fine . i , i had it delivered ,
but it &apos;s a generous serving , enough for two ,
and i just happened to find myself in this neighborhood ,
and i thought you might like some leftovers .
you just happened to find yourself in this neighborhood ?
i may have ordered a car
with no other destination than this one .
please , take it .
i will eat your roughage ,
but we both know that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
why can &apos;t you just admit you wanted to see me ?
okay , fine . i missed you .
i said it .
rufus , the upper east side
holds all the comforts i desire--
clean sidewalks , bergdorf goodman ,
and people whose job it is to open doors .
but there is no you .
and you &apos;re the only comfort i really need .
and the apartment just ...
it just doesn &apos;t seem like a home without you in it .
and in my abundance of time alone this week ,
i had a chance to think ,
what would you say to me selling the apartment
and us finding our own place-- one that fits us both ?
really ? you &apos;d do that ? you love that apartment .
i like that apartment a lot ,
but i love you .
and i want us to work .
me , too .
so were you a hit ?
hardly .
a nasty &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast landed before i did .
i didn &apos;t even get a chance to read .
you know , i really don &apos;t get it .
she &apos;s radio silent and then decides to go after me
on the most important day of my life ?
yeah.i don &apos;t know .
gossip girl works in mysterious ways .
i guess she isn &apos;t so irrelevant after all ?
you didn &apos;t happen to mention anything about our conversation
about lars von trier , did you ?
i mean , not that i even said anything bad , but--
no , not--not a word .
okay .
well , i guess i &apos;ll just act like i &apos;m not totally mortified
and try and get on with my life .
hopefully , this is the last i &apos;hearing from her .
yeah , hopefully .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
isn &apos;t it exciting ?
finally meeting the infamous gossip girl in the flesh .
hi . how many ?
hi . two , please . thanks .
why did we have to come all the way out here lunch ?
actually , i was hoping we could go next door
to the community garden .
they &apos;re having a tree @-@ planting event .
my friend alexis is covering it for mcsweeney &apos;s ,
so she wanted to grab a photo of us going green .
what ? no .
just because a tree grows in brooklyn
does not mean i have to plant it .
i &apos;m not going green . i &apos;m going home .
wait a second . wait a second .
look , we can &apos;t be photographed .
we are coming out tonight as a couple at the theater .
so we can come out now in brooklyn and then uptown later .
i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s the best of both worlds .
dan , a couple only has one chance
to make a first impression on the world ,
and i &apos;m not doing it knee @-@ deep in fertilizer
looking like vanessa whatshername .
look , blair , i &apos;m not trying to be difficult ,
but i don &apos;t wanna just melt into your world
and lose myself completely . we need a balance .
but i just spent the last year of my life
playing marie antoinette to prince possessive .
i &apos;m not going from habsburg to williamsburg .
i wanna be me .
and i wanna be me .
i &apos;m sorry . we didn &apos;t mean to eavesdrop ,
but we couldn &apos;t help but overhear your argument .
we &apos;ve had the same fight over a million times .
i &apos;m die @-@ hard upper east side .
and i &apos;m as queens as acrylic nails .
so we know a thing or two about settling our differences .
wait . it &apos;s you . you &apos;re julian tepper ,
and you &apos;re jenna gribbon .
you &apos;re like the brangelina of the five boroughs .
how you doing ?
hi . i &apos;m blair waldorf .
dan .
jenna .
dan .
so how did you find a solution ? what was your compromise ?
well , that &apos;s a long story .
well , we have time . lunch ?
i &apos;m sorry about your audition .
i know how badly you wanted the part .
you &apos;ll get the next one , okay ?
have you ever wondered who gossip girl actually is ?
like , have you ever tried to find her ?
yeah , of course . you know ,
but she keeps her identity pretty well hidden .
i have a theory--serena .
serena ... what ?
serena is gossip girl .
there &apos;s no use denying it .
i know you &apos;re the acting queen of cyberspace .
i also know that the real gossip girl
has been badgering you to return her site .
i should warn you that she &apos;s prepared to go to great lengths
to get what she wants , but this doesn &apos;t matter ,
because i want to help you stay on as gossip girl .
i want to protect your identity
and help you keep the site .
lola , that &apos;s ludicrous . serena &apos;s hated gossip girl
since we were freshmen in high school .
i mean , you can read for yourself
all the negative posts about her .
well , of course gossip girl has to slam serena sometimes .
it &apos;d be pretty obvious if she didn &apos;t .
why would you wanna help me ?
maybe i &apos;ll be helping myself , too .
if you remember , i have a history with gossip girl .
well , a history with gossip girl
means you have something to hide .
i &apos;m a woman who has lived .
i have plenty to hide .
but if you continue your reign as gossip girl ,
we both win .
well , so far you &apos;ve only told me how you do .
lola , look , i know you &apos;re an actress ,
and there &apos;s a certain amount of quirkiness
that i &apos;m supposed to find charming , but this is too much .
you have to stop letting your imagination run wild .
come on . we have a reservation at masa in 15 minutes .
actually , i don &apos;t think i can go .
i have to fix the situation with my audition .
i have a great deal of influence in new york media .
i &apos;ll make sure that your version of &quot; gossip girl &quot;
is the most popular web site in town .
i &apos;m sorry , nate .
wait . so what are you gonna do , call the director ?
or just spend the whole afternoon
obsessing about conspiracy theories ?
seriously , lola , it needs to stop .
i have to think about it .
don &apos;t take too long .
serena &apos;s gossip girl .
just wait . i &apos;m gonna prove it to you .
i &apos;ll be at &quot; the spectator &quot; after lunch .
you can give me your answer then .
happy blogging .
and that is the story of how i got julian
and his prada loafers to astoria .
and now i love pork buns . who knew ?
well , thank you for having lunch with us .
you &apos;ve really given us hope .
well , meals are easier to negotiate ,
but what about your social life ?
actually , every month we host a salon .
good food , good wine .
intellectual discussion .
not to brag , but people fight for invites .
you should come .
沙拉 · 索菲 · 弗里克 : 美国社交名人
agyness deyn and
sarah sophie flicker came to the last one ,
and mario carbone and rich torrisi did the menu ,
and then we screened &quot; my man godfrey . &quot;
carole lombard is my spirit animal .
we &apos;ll absolutely be at the next one .
guys , this has been fun , but we &apos;ve gotta go .
nice meeting you .
nice to meet you , too .
very nice to meet you .
dan .
i thought they were cute .
i wonder if it &apos;ll last .
to be transported back to the vicious circle .
it &apos;s so romantic and--and so au courant , so--
it &apos;s the perfect combination of you and me .
it &apos;s as if the angelika was on the 75th street .
let &apos;s forget the garden and the theater
and just host a salon for our official coming out .
its only fault is that i didn &apos;t think of it myself .
come on ! we have plenty to do .
yeah , i like that one .
just tell him to put it in color , please .
thanks .
hey , have you seen diana ?
uh , yeah , she &apos;s downstairs , in her office .
so are we still in a fight ?
uh , well , you did fire me , but , um ,
it actually turned out for the best .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;d really like to put it behind us .
yeah , me , too .
so ... what &apos;s new in your life ?
uh , recently , i &apos;ve had my hands full
with your long @-@ lost cousin .
what do you mean ?
ever since lola hit the &quot; it &quot; girl radar ,
she &apos;s been completely m.i.a. , and i didn &apos;t think
she was the type of girl to get caught up in it ,
but today there was this &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast about her ,
and she just kinda lost it--
all worked up , theories about who gossip girl is .
well , who does she think it is ?
you , actually .
what ?
yeah .
that &apos;s insane . what have i ever done to her ?
no , i know . it &apos;s crazy . she &apos;s just upset her audition ,
looking for someone to blame .
well , tell her not to look at me .
i really hope this ride doesn &apos;t change her .
i mean , she was such a sweet girl .
hey , it was , um , good to talk to you .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna go find diana .
yeah , you , too .
good news , jack . i &apos;m about to make a deal with serena ,
and as long as she controls the &quot; gossip girl &quot; web site ,
no one will ever find out what i did for chuck at the hospital .
uh @-@ oh , diana .
bye .
looks like mischief is written into your d.n.a.
okay , now that takes care of the flowers .
what glasses shall we use ?
mason jars .
there is something to be said
about that whole farm @-@ to @-@ table phenom .
uh , wine ?
french .
theme ?
well , i have a thing for du maurier ,
and you hanker for t.s. eliot .
we both love radiohead .
&quot; london calling &quot; --
an ode to the brits . it &apos;s perfect .
april bloomfield will cater .
i do secretly love pub food when it &apos;s made with foie .
who--who to invite ? serena ?
i @-@ i really want us to have a chance
at being successful tonight .
if she &apos;s there , we &apos;ll both be on edge .
so i think we should just wait till we have our footing .
nate ?
at a salon ? i &apos;m not even gonna dignify that with a response .
well , since we &apos;re breaking new ground together ,
why don &apos;t we bring some new people into the mix ?
like , uh , how about our new couple friends ?
well , they do qualify as influencers . approved .
and what about diana payne ?
she &apos;s british , and she &apos;s press .
if she writes about tonight ,
our new world will be the hottest destination in new york .
oh , okay , vanya . i see you tonight .
big kisses to you and ana and leo .
hey , dorota . i &apos;m here looking for serena . have you seen her ?
oh , miss serena hiding in room all day long
like blonde unabomber .
you know the best part of this guest list ?
no &quot; gossip girl &quot; moles .
i mean , can you imagine an entire night
without having to worry about embarrassing online photos
or snarky e @-@ blasts ?
and since we &apos;re gonna be surrounded by
new york literati and brooklyn &apos;s literati ,
it &apos;s the perfect opportunity for you to announce your second book .
you think that &apos;s a good idea ?
we &apos;ll be making our debut as a couple ,
and you can reclaim your place
as the most important young writer in new york city .
of course i think it &apos;s a good idea .
vanya , mr. humphrey will be back shortly ,
and he &apos;ll have some bags with him
if you could help him upstairs .
i will be so happy to have mr. humphrey back .
i haven &apos;t heard any great guitar riffs
through the wall lately .
oh ! here . thank you .
hello ?
rufus humphrey , please ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . uh , my husband &apos;s not here at the moment .
he should be home in an hour or so .
this is the front desk at the soho grand .
i &apos;m just calling to verify his credit card information .
oh , i can do that . what is he paying for ?
the stay of a hotel guest-- ivy dickens .
oh , i &apos;m ... sorry . i &apos;m--
i absolutely cannot verify that card .
certainly not to pay for ivy dickens .
okay . uh , thank you for your time .
thank you .
excuse me . weren &apos;t you working the night
that chuck bass was brought into the hospital ?
yes . i remember that night well .
do you happen to recognize this woman ?
yes . she arrived at the hospital the night of the accident .
she donated blood and left quickly
before mr. bass regained consciousness .
thank you so much . you &apos;ve been a huge help .
sure .
hi . this is serena van der woodsen ,
calling for ms. payne .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s not available at the moment .
would you like to leave a message ?
uh , do you know where i might find her ?
i need to speak with her immediately .
i @-@ i have a lead on a story that
i know she &apos;ll wanna break before the &quot; daily news &quot; &quot;
okay , uh , just a second .
she &apos;ll be attending the salon at daniel humphrey &apos;s this evening .
it &apos;s located at--
yeah , okay , i got it . thank you .
i know you &apos;re mad at me ,
but if you &apos;ll just meet me at dan &apos;s ,
i have proof that serena is gossip girl .
fine , but only on the condition
that if your so @-@ called proof comes up short ,
you &apos;ll agree to drop this once and for all .
yes , absolutely . thank you .
thank you . thank you so much .
you won &apos;t regret it .
all right . see you soon .
any interest in , uh ,
taking a little field trip out to the 7 @-@ 1 @-@ 8 ?
sure . i haven &apos;t been slumming in a while .
seems new york &apos;s newest intellectuals
are about to get dumbed down .
welcome , everybody .
tonight is about wit and wisdom and discussion .
our theme of the evening , as you know ,
is all things british .
and our menu , prepared by chef april bloomfield ,
takes its inspiration from that theme .
so as each new dish is served ,
a new topic of discussion will be introduced .
food service will begin momentarily ,
but until then , dan and i are so pleased to be hosting you .
cheerio !
here , here ! sorry i &apos;m late .
late ? how can you be late
to an event you didn &apos;t even know was happening ?
what are you doing here ?
in the madness of planning this soiree ,
you must have forgotten to invite me .
but it &apos;s okay . don &apos;t stop on account of me .
i &apos;ll just make myself at home .
um , the first course is a lovely combination of ...
look , it &apos;s lola .
i &apos;m wearing the lola .
wait , you invited her ?
yes .
no .
talk amongst yourselves .
dan and i will be back in a london minute .
i am trying to maintain a stiff british upper lip ,
but how can i keep calm and carry on
with those two here ?
serena will spend the whole night judging us ,
and lola is probably just trying
to squeeze every last drop of free press out of the night
so she can move on from the community theater circuit .
blair ,
our salon can easily handle a few party crashers .
and besides , you should be at least a little flattered that
they both made it all the way to brooklyn to check it out .
look ...
tonight is gonna be great .
deal ?
deal .
isn &apos;t this exciting ,
dan making his big book announcement tonight ?
hey , wasn &apos;t it gossip girl
who first broke the news about &quot; inside &quot; ?
i think so .
do you think she &apos;ll break the news
about the sequel tonight ,
or will someone else beat her to the punch ?
i mean , there are a lot of media types here .
of course , maybe gossip girl is here , too .
in which case , she doesn &apos;t have to worry .
gossip girl doesn &apos;t need to travel to get her news .
she &apos;s got sources everywhere .
really ? even at a party like this ?
i mean ... look around .
who would be sending gossip girl tips ?
well , all i &apos;m saying
is that this book party is a pretty big deal .
i think gossip girl would have to post about it
to stay relevant .
look , i understand gossip girl &apos;s probably
pretty fascinating to a newcomer like you ,
but to me , she &apos;s just not .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m gonna go rejoin the other guests .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m not sure . nate invited me .
what are we doing here ?
well , lola invited us .
hi , hi , hi .
where do you get off inviting people to my salon ?
explain yourself .
yes , lola , i think an explanation &apos;s in order .
nate , listen to me .
blair , leave it .
i know you think i &apos;ve completely lost it ,
but i &apos;m about to prove to you once and for all
that serena is gossip girl .
but what if you &apos;re wrong ?
i &apos;m not . serena crashed this party
because she heard that dan was gonna announce
the topic of his second book ,
and i promise you that 30 seconds later ,
it &apos;s gonna be all over &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
yeah , well , that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
i mean , anyone here could send in a tip , including dan .
fine . i have a better idea .
wait , lola--
no . i &apos;ll show you . trust me .
so , mr. humphrey , how you like new magnetic fields ?
i love it . hey , lil .
can you just leave these here ? thank you .
have you secretly been putting
ivy dickens up in a hotel ?
yes , i have .
you left her penniless ,
i &apos;m the one who convinced her to move out .
i felt responsible ,
couldn &apos;t let her live on the street .
why not ?
she &apos;s a thief . that &apos;s exactly where she belongs .
she &apos;s a young girl . she has nothing .
she has no family , no friends . no money .
i could care less about ivy , which you well know .
how could you help this girl ...
lily , you have to under--
after what she did to our family ?
i did what i thought was right .
with my money .
i used my own personal credit card .
at least now i know how you really feel .
this is clearly a much bigger issue .
entrees are almost ready ,
but i &apos;ve ran out of ice , and i need the ice
to finish off my dessert and my special cocktail .
i think meryl streep was a perfect ...
in the world of the novel , london has become
the very idea of the big city .
i need to speak with you .
excuse me . graham greene .
martin amis . discuss .
okay , don &apos;t freak out ,
but since everybody &apos;s crashing ,
april &apos;s running short on ice .
we need to run out and get some more ,
so dinner &apos;s gonna be delayed .
how long ?
no . you know what ? we can handle this .
w.w.d.p.d. ?
what would dorothy parker do ?
uh , get them drunk until we get back .
of course . a @-@ a liquid diet of booze
and great intellectual discussion should suffice .
can i top off anyone &apos;s wine ?
nothing gets conversation flowing like a good red .
dan , why are we discussing british literary figures
when we have new york &apos;s most celebrated author in our midst ?
an author with an announcement , perhaps ?
good evening , everyone . sorry i &apos;m late .
oh , diana . just the person i was hoping to see .
do--do you have a moment to speak privately ?
sure .
and we &apos;re off to get the ice .
so i &apos;m assuming you have an answer for me .
what do you say ?
me and my resources plus gossip girl
is a powerful combination .
well , i don &apos;t know . usually when i enter into a partnership
with someone , i @-@ i like to know everything about them .
i @-@ i think they call that vetting ?
vet away , darling .
well , i just have a couple questions .
like , where were you the night of chuck &apos;s accident ,
november 18th ?
i was ...
i was here in new york .
and do you happen to know where he was treated for his injuries ?
or his blood type ?
do you know the date he was born
or where you were on that date ?
i know what you &apos;re getting at .
well , if you know what i &apos;m getting at ,
then why don &apos;t you answer for me ?
or would you like me to do that ?
what do you want me to say ?
the nurse recognized you .
you saved chuck &apos;s life .
and you did that because ...
i &apos;m chuck &apos;s mother .
if you want my advice ,
it &apos;s run , lola , run ,
&apos;cause you just let out the mother of all secrets .
is it true ?
yes , charles , it is .
don &apos;t .
just ... stay right there .
you have been in new york for months ,
inviting me to parties , hiring my friends ,
hanging out in my apartment in your underwear ,
banging my best friend .
did it not occur to you to mention this ,
that you were my mother ? !
please , chuck , i can explain .
i @-@ i can &apos;t do this right now ... or ever . i can &apos;t .
well , this is the most dramatic salon i &apos;ve ever been to .
very unbritish , if you ask me .
i hope you &apos;re pleased with yourself .
i was right all along .
you &apos;re actually her . you &apos;re gossip girl .
even if i am , it doesn &apos;t matter .
do you realize the damage that you &apos;ve just done ?
you had no right to do that .
who wants another pimm &apos;s cup ?
wait . what happened here ?
where &apos;s everyone going ?
that was more soap opera than salon .
this never would &apos;ve happened at the oracle club .
this was supposed to be our coming out party .
it was supposed to capture who we are as a couple ,
but it wasn &apos;t smart or interesting .
it wasn &apos;t uptown or downtown .
it was a bloody mess .
blair , it was-- it was just a party .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
we tried to create a new world
for our relationship to exist in ,
but we failed miserably .
you don &apos;t want to live in my world ,
and i certainly don &apos;t want to live in yours .
so where does that leave us ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m genuinely sorry that i hurt chuck today .
i &apos;m not sorry i hurt you .
here &apos;s your coat , sir .
please , whatever you do ,
just don &apos;t tell anyone ...
what you know .
nate , wait .
where are you going ?
i need to find chuck and make sure he &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m sorry . this is all my fault .
i told you to leave things alone .
it &apos;s one thing to accuse serena of being gossip girl .
but sending in that video about chuck ?
i can &apos;t forgive that .
i mean , do you have anything to say for yourself ?
no .
thank you .
the brits say &quot; god save the queen . &quot;
but it looks like lola is
the one in need of a royal s.o.s.
nate , i need to speak with you and chuck .
we don &apos;t have anything to say to you .
you need to go now .
it &apos;s okay .
i may be angry , but i need to know the truth .
you running away ?
no .
joining the army ?
auditioning for one of those
&quot; america &apos;s got idol talent factor &quot; shows ?
i was hoping i could have a sleepover with you .
you do realize that means you &apos;d be entering my world .
i do .
our relationship is not choosing one world or another .
our relationship is our world .
well , then tonight our relationship
was a world @-@ wide disaster .
it &apos;s probably not gonna be our last ,
but we have to face these disasters together .
we &apos;re a team .
so ... maybe we can ... be a team at the met ball ?
absolutely .
and , uh , at a beet pickling festival .
you know i wouldn &apos;t be caught dead
at a beet pickling festival ?
i &apos;m just messing with you .
i met your father when he was still with elizabeth .
i was very young .
i couldn &apos;t resist him .
he was charming , handsome .
it felt as if he had the whole world at his feet .
i knew he was involved with someone else .
you mean married .
yeah .
we had an affair ,
and it only ended when i got pregnant .
but you kept the baby .
you must have wanted me .
i mean , why did you give me up ?
i was a mess .
mixed up in the wrong things with the wrong people .
unfit to raise a child .
and then elizabeth-- she couldn &apos;t get pregnant .
it ... seemed like a way to solve all our problems .
so you made a deal .
after it was over , i left town , alone ...
and ashamed .
but a few years later ,
when i heard that elizabeth had died ,
although i now know that wasn &apos;t the case ,
i came back .
but elizabeth couldn &apos;t do it .
she couldn &apos;t stick to her end of the bargain ,
to raise someone else &apos;s child as her own .
i wanted to see you desperately .
but bart thought it would be too confusing for you .
so you just stayed away until eight months ago ?
when i came back to the city last fall ,
i was hoping to watch over you ...
from afar .
nate &apos;s bed is not that far .
well , i didn &apos;t intend for things to get as serious
as they did with nate .
and then i thought ,
if you never find out the truth ,
what &apos;s the harm ?
so what does it all mean ...
now that i know ?
that &apos;s for you to decide .
you know where to find me .
haven &apos;t you stirred up enough trouble for one night ?
i came to return this .
why didn &apos;t you tell nate when you had the chance ?
because i knew it would hurt him if he found out .
you &apos;re one of his best friends .
even when you guys are mad at each other ,
he still cares about you .
i couldn &apos;t ruin chuck &apos;s life and nate &apos;s in the same night .
can i just ask why ?
why do you do it ?
i only became gossip girl recently ,
and--and right now it &apos;s the only thing i have .
i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s the only thing in my life
that i can hold on to ,
you know , because a lot of times
my life is just really out of control .
well , i get that , but you &apos;re doing exactly
what was done to you and to everyone else .
yeah . i mean , i was hurt , sure , but i survived .
a little adversity can actually be good for you .
you &apos;ll see how things work around here .
no , i won &apos;t , actually .
i &apos;m officially resigning from the upper east side .
i have a whole life at julliard
where the drama &apos;s reserved for the stage ,
and i think i belong back there .
so if you want the upper east side back ,
it &apos;s all yours .
you &apos;re the only &quot; it girl &quot; that matters , anyway .
you see to that yourself .
the upper east side is filled with high rollers .
sorry , sir , but your debit card was declined .
are you sure about that ?
why don &apos;t you try running it again ?
i did . four times , to be precise .
sorry about that .
here you go . i don &apos;t need change .
some people choose to bet on themselves ...
while others are happy to bet on someone else .
i &apos;m sorry , but if you insist that damien hirst &apos;s work
is anything but simple @-@ minded ,
sensationalist , and fatuous ,
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;ll be able to lay my head next to yours tonight .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s fine , but you can &apos;t deny
that his influence on the art market
as we know it today is massive .
but luck is a funny thing .
it &apos;s easy to accept it when it goes your way .
but when it doesn &apos;t ...
call it injustice , call it treachery ...
hey , mom .
you were right . the upper east side is toxic .
i never should have stepped foot in it ,
just like you warned me .
but , um , you don &apos;t have to worry
because i &apos;m done with it .
there &apos;s nothing else tying me
to the van der woodsens or their world ,
so ... i have to say , it &apos;s huge relief .
talk to you soon .
but remember ,
the most important rule in gambling ...
is that the house always wins .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
