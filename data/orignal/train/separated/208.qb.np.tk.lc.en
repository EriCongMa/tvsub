gossip girl here--your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i have to be blair waldorf
before i can be chuck bass &apos; girlfriend .
if two people are meant to be together ,
eventually they &apos;ll find their way back .
i gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago .
just wish she could see how great you &apos;re doing now .
you tried to destroy my friendship with blair ,
my reputation , my academic career .
so who much will it take for you to leave my daughter alone ?
i could really use some help from the inside right now .
what exactly did you have in mind ?
we need to turn everyone against serena .
how could i have kissed either of you
when i couldn &apos;t even get into the party ?
so someone dressed exactly like you just happened to be
attracted to both of us ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t explain it .
mom &apos;s not the only one who still sees me
as a messed @-@ up 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
your sister just withdrew from columbia .
alienate everybody , drop out of school , run away--
that sounds like serena .
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s anything we can do anymore .
thanksgiving-- my favorite holiday .
as always , i &apos;ll be spending it giving thanks
for the bounty of secrets i &apos;ve harvested from you this year .
but leave a place for me at your table .
i &apos;ll be back for just desserts .
strolling the christmas markets with daddy and roman ,
celebrating beaujolais nouveau at le tambour .
did you remember my new burberry ?
yes .
that &apos;s the double @-@ faced . i need the shearling .
do you want me to freeze ?
yes . i want you to freeze .
why aren &apos;t you excited for me ?
you know how much i love paris in autumn .
with everything that &apos;s happened with mr. chuck and miss serena ,
i also know that you want to get out of the dodge .
out of ... dodge . it &apos;s a place , not a pickup truck ,
and i &apos;m not leaving because of them .
well , not entirely because of them .
it &apos;s ana &apos;s first holiday season .
so many traditions to share--
the breaking of oplatek ,
the waiting for first star ,
the singing koledy .
do any of these traditions include getting to the point ?
i took liberty of making
harold &apos;s famous thanksgiving pie for you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s getting through airport security .
i thought we could drop it off at van der woodsens&apos;
on your way to airport .
serena is the one who forced chuck and me into the open
and tried going after my committee .
she &apos;s the one staying at lily &apos;s to avoid me .
shouldn &apos;t she be bringing me pies ?
forget i mention it . i &apos;ll throw pie in trash .
no . it &apos;s fine .
but this is only about pies and traditions . that &apos;s all .
do they have a word in polish for &quot; pain in the ass &quot; ?
we have relatives i don &apos;t know about ?
it &apos;s always a possibility .
your mother wanted to pull out all the stops this year .
so this is about , uh , denial .
have you heard from serena ?
no . she hasn &apos;t responded to any of my texts .
and , granted , most of them included angry emoticons ,
but , uh , i was actually thinking of going over to blair &apos;s now
to try to talk to her .
you will do no such thing .
come on , lily . it &apos;s the holidays .
she dropped out of college .
she refuses to return our phone calls .
she &apos;s a grown woman throwing temper tantrums
just to punish me . when she is ready to take responsibility
for her actions , we &apos;ll talk . until then , you know what ?
i &apos;m done being punished .
you know , and everything looks so great .
maybe just move the , uh , flowers a little closer .
how could they not have pumpkin pie ?
we &apos;re at foragers market . i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find something .
how about the organic pumpkin tarts with gluten @-@ free crust ?
do i look like i could have baked those ?
i told my dad i would .
you know how he loves his tradition .
maybe you can tell him the new tradition
is being truthful about the origin
of thanksgiving dessert .
how about you come and tell him yourself ?
he told me he invited you but you weren &apos;t sure if you were coming ?
well , i wasn &apos;t sure if you wanted me to .
yeah , i @-@ i do . i mean , if it weren &apos;t for you ,
i would have let serena destroy my friendship with nate .
friendships are important .
i saw the blast about
what she did at saints and sinners .
have you spoken to her since that happened ?
nope . not planning to . neither is nate .
kissing both of us proves that she doesn &apos;t care
about either of us , so we &apos;re just trying to ...
move on , now really think about it .
how &apos;s that working out for ya ?
pretty poorly , thank you , which is why i could--
i could really use you there today if she does come ,
so ... what do you say ?
do i have time to run back to the loft ?
i have this amazing tofu sage stuffing recipe .
for tofu ? how could i say no ?
i was gonna swing by before we left for grandfather &apos;s ,
if that &apos;s still okay with you .
of course . can &apos;t wait .
just you ?
she just needs more time , dad .
well ... time i got lots of .
tell your mom i said happy thanksgiving .
she &apos;ll come around , i promise .
it &apos;s just , uh , it &apos;d be great to see her , you know ?
i &apos;d love the chance to talk to her
so she could see for herself just how much i &apos;ve changed .
let me talk to her . i &apos;ll see you soon , okay ?
yeah .
mr. stahl , what are you doing here ?
nathaniel . just , uh ,
dropping off some papers for your mother .
well , on thanksgiving ?
yes . well , they &apos;re time @-@ sensitive .
you know what ? she &apos;s ... she &apos;s not in right now .
oh . she &apos;s getting her hair done , so ... i can give that to her .
well ... okay .
thanks .
happy thanksgiving .
have a good one .
you , too .

what are you doing here ?
thanksgiving-- the only day of the year
it &apos;s acceptable to eat dinner before 8 : 00 .
oh . of course . right . thanksgiving .
we bring pie .
i should have asked lily if you were coming .
i can leave if you &apos;d like .
don &apos;t be silly . i was just headed to j.f.k.
but even if i wasn &apos;t ,
we should get used to little run @-@ ins like these .
i mean , if bruce and demi can do it ,
it can &apos;t be that difficult .
oh . blair , dorota . what are you doing here ?
just bringing a little tradition .
i &apos;m spending the holidays with daddy and roman in paris .
i figured since we usually
spend this day together ,
that , you know ... um , is serena here ?
we thought she was with you .
no , i haven &apos;t seen her since chuck &apos;s party .
she never came home .
okay . all right . now i &apos;m worried .
charles ?
she &apos;s not at the empire .
well , then where the hell is she ?
9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . what is your emergency ?
my name is serena van der woodsen .
i don &apos;t know where i am
or how i got here .
please help .
hey , man , i just got your text . what &apos;s up ?
my mom &apos;s filing for divorce .
at least she &apos;s trying to .
oh . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , man . that sucks .
what am i supposed to do ?
you know , how do i-- how do i stop this ?
you can &apos;t . i know it &apos;s not what you want to hear ,
but if kids could fix their parents &apos; relationships ,
they would .
hell , if we could fix our own relationships ,
we would .
that &apos;s your advice ? do nothing ?
no . i mean ,
if it helps ,
i know my parents are happier now than they were .
and don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but i mean ,
it can &apos;t come as a total shock , right ?
it is . i mean , she &apos;s had years to do this .
the guy embezzled . he got arrested .
he tried to skip bail , and then he went to prison .
she stayed married to him this whole time ,
and now she wants out ?
i mean , what &apos;s worse is that i feel he &apos;s--he &apos;s really changed .
i just-- i gotta get her to see that .
well , good luck .
thanks , man .
actually , no . no , thanks .
your advice sucked .
i &apos;m sorry . hold on a second .
hey . uh , hey , dad . i &apos;m at nate &apos;s right now ,
but vanessa should be there soon ,
though i should warn you ,
there is , uh , stuffing with tofu involved .
i hate to do this to you over the phone ,
but , um , i need to tell you something ,
and i prefer to keep it in the immediate family for now .
serena &apos;s in the hospital .
is everything okay ?
we hope so . we &apos;re at st. margaret &apos;s .
all right , well , i &apos;m close . i &apos;ll be there soon .
no . i understand ,
but when will we be allowed to see her ?
no one &apos;s telling us anything .
well , just be patient ,
and someone will be with you soon . okay ?
let us know when you can !
blair ...
all they could tell us is what we already know .
she dialed 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 from a motel in queens
and that drugs were involved .
what are we supposed to do ?
for now ...
just be here when she wakes up .
i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee .
hi , dad . what &apos;s , uh , going on ?
hey , sweetie , i wish i didn &apos;t have to tell you this ,
but ... serena &apos;s in the hospital .
looks like an overdose .
oh , my god . what--
we &apos;re hoping she &apos;s gonna be fine .
if it &apos;s okay with your mom ,
i &apos;d really like you here with us .
i know you and serena have a complicated past ,
but at the end of the day--
no , no , uh , of course . i &apos;ll get there soon as i can .
dad , can ...
just tell lily how sorry i am .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll appreciate that .
hello ?
is anyone home ?
hi , hi , hi .
dorota .
what are you doing here ?
holding down fort .
why ? where is everyone ?
maybe you should call mr. humphrey .
我在回家路上
hey , this is dan . leave a message .
let me make a call ,
see if one of my doctors can get us some answers .
thanks .
where is she ? is she all right ? what happened ?
she overdosed in some
cheap motel in queens , alone .
why didn &apos;t she come to me ?
i mean , no matter how angry we were at each other ,
she knows .
i don &apos;t know what i would do
if anything happened to her .
what do the doctors say ?
rufus and lily are waiting to talk to them .
what ?
drugs in a cheap motel--
that does not sound like serena to me .
sometimes i forget
how much of a recent addition you are , humphrey .
you met her as a girl coming home ,
trying to start over .
i wish it wasn &apos;t true , but ...
sounds a lot like the serena i used to know .
mrs. humphrey ?
i &apos;m dr. keller .
it was a drug overdose , but it wasn &apos;t severe .
we have her on fluids right now ,
but her liver and kidneys look fine .
uh , what now ?
well , she &apos;s stable , so soon as she wakes up ,
we &apos;ll have to discharge her .
i was wondering if you wanted
to discuss a place for her recovery .
i understand your family had a good experience
with the ostroff center .
well , she &apos;s not a drug addict , and she didn &apos;t mean
to harm herself . this was all sort of a stupid mistake ,
and as you said yourself , it wasn &apos;t severe .
the amount ingested isn &apos;t what worries me .
in addition to the painkillers and sleeping pills ,
we found nortriptyline in her motel room .
it &apos;s an antidepressant , but taken in conjunction
with the other medications , it can be fatal .
was your daughter battling depression ?
no .
uh , not that we &apos;re aware of .
i &apos;ll give you a minute .
thank you .
do you think she was taking something and not telling us ?
i don &apos;t know .
this was serena acting out , blowing off steam
like she always does . it just went too far .
that &apos;s all .
looking for this ? any other earth @-@ shattering news
you plan on having delivered today ?
you opened it ?
you &apos;re honestly gonna make this about me
not respecting your privacy ?
mom , you &apos;re not even giving him a chance .
i mean , after everything that he &apos;s been through--
everything he &apos;s been through .
what about what i &apos;ve been through ?
i &apos;m sorry , but your father walked away from us
long before he went to prison .
but he &apos;s there now , and he &apos;s changed .
the only thing that &apos;s changed is he &apos;s two years
into his sentence , and he &apos;s starting to see
the light at the end of the tunnel .
that &apos;s not true , and if you talked to him ,
you wouldn &apos;t feel that way . mom , please .
just come see him with me .
i mean , don &apos;t you owe him at least that ?
we need to be at your grandfather &apos;s by 6 : 00 .
you can see your father tomorrow .
we saw you talking to the doctors . how is she ?
when can we see her ?
doctor thinks it might be a good idea
for serena to get some help . what kind of help ?
oh , my god . they don &apos;t think she did this on purpose , do they ?
no . no one &apos;s saying that .
but there &apos;s a chance ?
have you made a decision ?
no . we need to think .
here &apos;s a crazy suggestion .
why don &apos;t we ask serena and see what she wants ?
well , she &apos;s not gonna go anywhere but home .
i can tell you that right now .
if you decide she needs treatment ,
we have grounds to sign off on an involuntary admission .
you can &apos;t be serious .
to admit her against her will is wrong .
and if you do that , you &apos;re not gonna be able to take it back .
but what if we don &apos;t , and it happens again ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m scared for her .
it would be different if she never acted out like this ,
but she has .
it &apos;s your choice , lil . we &apos;ll support you ,
whatever it is you decide .
guys ?
i just want what &apos;s best for her .
what if it &apos;s the only way for her to move on , get centered ?
guys !
... well @-@ known manhattan socialite
and former party girl serena van der woodsen ,
was admitted to st. margaret &apos;s emergency room
after e.m.t.s responded to a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call
from a motel in queens .
i don &apos;t know where i am or how i got here .
please help .
oh , my god .
no stranger to controversy ,
ms. van der woodsen was recently the focus of ...
there are news vans in the streets . this place is
gonna be swarming with paparazzi in about five minutes .
so we &apos;ll get her out of here ,
take her home where she can rest .
no . i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re pitching tents
outside the apartment as we speak .
that &apos;s not what she needs . she needs quiet . she needs safe .
mrs. humphrey , your daughter is waking up now .
would you like to see her ?
ostroff center .
and if she doesn &apos;t wanna go ? involuntary hold ?
yes . now .
okay .
spacious .
your room is bigger than mine was .
how you feeling ?
betrayed , thanks .
serena , i know right now--
mom , stop . your daughter wakes up alone ,
drugged in an empty motel room , and you don &apos;t call the cops ,
you don &apos;t ask if she &apos;s okay or what happened .
you just have her committed . what kind of mother does that ?
the kind of mother who wants her daughter safe .
is that what you &apos;re telling yourself ?
that this is what &apos;s best for me ?
well , serena , this isn &apos;t exactly what &apos;s best for me .
you know , it would be a lot easier to take you home
and act like this never happened .
but i &apos;m afraid for you .
how could you let her do this to me ?
because i love you .
when i was in here , i didn &apos;t wanna be ,
at least not at first .
i &apos;m not in denial , eric . i didn &apos;t do this .
it took me a long time to come to terms with what i did , too .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you when we first found out . i ...
no , don &apos;t worry about it , man . so what happened ?
she told the doctor she can &apos;t remember anything .
at the party , serena said she didn &apos;t kiss either of us ,
that she had no idea what happened .
and now this .
now what--what if something else is going on ?
or maybe you just wanna think that
because it &apos;s easier than the truth .
look , i gotta go .
uh ... just tell serena &quot; hey &quot; for me when you see her , okay ?
yeah , sure , of course .
dan , i care a lot about serena . i always will .
whether she realizes it or not ,
this is how she pulls people back in .
and i &apos;m not gonna let it happen anymore .
neither should you .
we need to talk .
to my super about letting strangers into my apartment ?
no , about serena .
her overdose ? i had no idea she was so depressed .
she wasn &apos;t , until we made her that way .
i mean , we turned everyone against her--dan , nate , blair .
anything serena did after she left that party
is not our fault .
maybe , but we still need to
tell her what we did ...
and tell her that we &apos;re sorry .
i mean , her mom had her admitted to the ostroff center .
serena needs to know she &apos;s not crazy .
i &apos;m going there now .
okay , wait .
no matter what we did ,
serena still went on a bender and overdosed .
maybe she needs the help that that center can provide .
who knows ? we may have called attention
to a larger problem
that could have been much worse .
but promise me that
you &apos;re not gonna say anything without talking to me first .
okay .
i gotta go .
i see my mom is sending in the big guns .
no , lily didn &apos;t send me . in fact , i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s a fan of mine right now .
what happened ?
honestly , i don &apos;t know .
but i really wish i did ,
because then maybe i could explain it to everyone .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?
like , what do you know for certain ?
heading into the party to look for you .
you were the one that i came to kiss .
you and only you .
it &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m certain of .
it &apos;s ... the only thing i still am .
get your stuff .
i was just about to call you
have you heard from jenny ?
she just left . where are you ?
i &apos;m heading to the ostroff center
after talking to dan .
oh , good , because jenny &apos;s on her way over there now
to come clean about what we did .
well , maybe she should .
i will tell you the same thing that i told her with one caveat .
we are not responsible for what serena did
after she left that night .
if jenny wants to come clean ,
they will forgive her eventually .
she &apos;s family . you &apos;re not .
you will lose all of them , especially dan .
he will use you as an excuse
to go right back to serena ,
and this time , that &apos;s where he &apos;ll stay .
if jenny wants to go down for something that we didn &apos;t do ,
then that &apos;s her call ,
but she goes down alone .
there you are .
i thought i &apos;d go pick her up some comfort food from e.a.t.
do you wanna come up ?
sure , i guess .
i &apos;m glad that we can be here together for serena .
i &apos;d like to know that when push comes to shove ,
maybe nothing has to change between us .
blair .
dad , i came as soon as i--
sorry . i had to tell him
what you did to serena .
what i did ?
vanessa told me she overheard
how you were gonna turn everyone against serena .
that &apos;s the real reason you came back--
to teach her some kind of a lesson ?
well , you sure did . are you proud of yourself ?
rufus , i can &apos;t believe what just happened .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s serena . she &apos;s gone .
time to head in ?
yeah , but you have another visitor joining you first .
i &apos;ll be right back to get you .
mom .
when you didn &apos;t show up at the car ,
i thought long and hard about what you said .
i &apos;m not making any promises , but at the very least ,
i should hear your father out before i end things .
what changed your mind ?
we made a ton of mistakes in our marriage ,
but you weren &apos;t one of them .
if my son is asking me to do this ,
then i need to try .
and , uh , grandfather &apos;s thanksgiving ?
it &apos;ll be nice to make him wait . no one ever does .
how do i look ?
you look great .
i want you to grab some food , whatever you can for the trip ?
i &apos;m gonna get some , uh , clothes and toiletries .
okay . we got some , um , apples , but they &apos;re squishy and brown .
uh , cereal ...
not much else except some old milk
and tofu ,
if you like that , which you apparently do .
mm , no , that &apos;s vanessa .
where is she ?
that &apos;s a good question .
you know , there &apos;s a bodega by the bus station .
come on . i bust you out of the loony bin .
you &apos;re gonna mock my choice of transportation ?
we &apos;re fugitives , all right ? we &apos;re taking the bus .
are we really doing this-- just running away together ?
no , running away is what guilty people do .
we &apos;re just getting out of the city for a few days .
to get some space and clear your head .
it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s a vacation .
a vacation ? i like that .
hey . thank you for believing in me .
how can i not ?
there you are .
both of you .
i didn &apos;t wanna get into it in front of everyone ,
but now it &apos;s your turn to face the music .
maybe i did try to trick serena
at the saints and sinners party ,
but i didn &apos;t do it alone .
and we didn &apos;t mean for it to end up like this .
&quot; we &quot; ?
yes , me , juliet , and vanessa .
we were all in it together .
that &apos;s not what vanessa said .
what , are you gonna believe her more than me ?
jenny , i &apos;m not gonna argue with you
about how responsible you are . one @-@ third , two @-@ thirds .
you can &apos;t deny you did it ,
and i am not vanessa
and juliet &apos;s father .
i &apos;m yours .
serena could have died .
i know ! dad , i know . i &apos;m sorry ! i ...
it was supposed to be a prank to teach her a lesson .
i never should have come back to the city .
well , on that we can both agree .
then i guess there &apos;s no reason for me to stay .
jenny , where are you going ?
you can spare me whatever you rehearsed on the way over .
i &apos;m not going back .
even if it &apos;s what &apos;s best for you ?
you don &apos;t get a vote .
i can &apos;t believe you took her side .
serena--
look , call whoever you need to call , but the only way
i &apos;m going back there is in a straitjacket .
dan , you stay here for just a moment .
you may not agree with every decision i make regarding
my daughter &apos;s well @-@ being ,
but you have no right to intervene .
i am her mother .
i know her much better than you do ,
and i have been there for certain parts of her life .
that you have no idea about .
really ? which parts are those ?
because from the way serena tells it ,
it sounds like
i &apos;ve clocked more hours by her side than you have .
look , i love you . you know that .
and you have a big heart just like your father ,
and just like him , you tend to see the good in everyone ,
no matter what they do .
no , not always .
she &apos;s not just the beautiful teenage girl
you saw at some party anymore .
she &apos;s a troubled young woman ,
avoiding some very real consequences .
and unless you wanna help her deal with those ,
then i suggest you step out of the way so that i can .
with all due respect ,
maybe i am only seeing the good in serena ,
but--but i &apos;m at least looking at her and not at myself .
and what is that supposed to mean ?
you committed her because you don &apos;t wanna deal with her .
you--you don &apos;t even wanna talk to her .
why ?
well , maybe i &apos;m afraid of what she might say .
maybe ...
what she did was a cry for help
and i &apos;m the only one who can hear it .
well , i ...
i don &apos;t know , but if that is the case ,
you should know , and if it &apos;s not ,
then we really should find out what happened .
but regardless , the only way to find out
is to--is to sit and talk .
what makes you think
i wanna talk to you any more than her ?
do you remember when i had my problem ?
and i never wanted to go to dr. sherman ?
so you would walk me and wait outside the building
to make sure that i went in ,
and an hour later you &apos;d be standing there to walk me home ,
no questions asked . if it wasn &apos;t for you ,
i &apos;d never have gotten better .
except i don &apos;t need to get better . i didn &apos;t do anything .
so , what ? someone went on a bender and rented a room
with your credit card and forced pills down your throat ?
i know how it sounds .
good , &apos; cause it sounds ...
crazy . yeah . i got that .
afternoon , upper east siders .
were your dinners as filling as mine was ?
hope not , because have i got some dessert for you ...
with sugar on top .
mom , um ... i &apos;m sorry .
it seems everyone &apos;s favorite party girl
fell off the wagon and landed in rehab .
good luck getting a lohan @-@ dle on things , s.
from the looks of it ,
you &apos;ve got a lot to recover from .
take me back to ostroff .
if i don &apos;t remember what happened in this photo ,
who knows what else i did that i don &apos;t remember ?
don &apos;t do that to yourself .
thank you for being the one person who believed in me ...
even though it turns out you were wrong , too .
i wasn &apos;t wrong to believe in you .
i still do .
i always will .
mom &apos;s downstairs . you ready ?
i really thought i was doing the right thing . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
why don &apos;t you come back to the apartment with us ?
i &apos;m hoping it &apos;s where your sister ran off to ,
and maybe we can turn this thanksgiving around .
thanks , but i @-@ i @-@ i really need to spend some time alone .
we &apos;re around if you change your mind .
where have you been ? i &apos;ve been trying to contact you .
i was baking you a pumpkin pie with a file inside .
what &apos;s up with you ?
we have a lot to be thankful for .
saints and sinners went perfectly .
everyone turned against her .
i even got her to drop out of columbia .
that &apos;s great . w @-@ why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because it &apos;s serena .
she worms herself out of everything ,
and i needed to make sure that there was one more nail
in her coffin-- something that would force
her family and friends to look at her differently ... forever .
what did you do ?
they took serena to st. margaret &apos;s
on a drug overdose .
oh , my god . you drugged her ?
don &apos;t worry . i don &apos;t think there was any permanent damage--
to her health , at least .
that was not part of the plan .
well , i made it part of the plan .
my financial support ,
apartment , columbia ,
nate ...
look , this isn &apos;t just about you anymore .
if there is a line that you wouldn &apos;t have crossed ,
you should &apos;ve told me before i lost everything .
happy thanksgiving , brother .
you know , i &apos;d never even been to brooklyn
until serena met dan humphrey .
now i know the drive way too well .
i missed my flight and i forgot to call daddy and roman .
they &apos;ll be worried .
i should do that when i get home .
it &apos;ll be way too late there now .
we should go back to my place , see what food i have .
maybe watch a movie ?
dorota downloaded a whole bunch of mgm musicals
for the plane .
she said it would cheer me up .
i know how much you love cyd charisse .
blair .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just a little bit of a mess right now .
after everything that happened today ,
the thought of losing serena forever ...
maybe a part of me is questioning
what i said to you last week .
i showed up today for serena .
what you said was right .
we need to be on our own , figure out where we go from there .
otherwise , we &apos;re just torturing ourselves .
this isn &apos;t torturing me .
i can &apos;t be your friend right now ,
as much as i wish i could .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not . i got to spend a little more time with you .
happy thanksgiving , chuck .
sorry .
oh , no , it was me .
hey , juliet . see you next week ?
i &apos;m actually going away for a bit .
visitor pass juliet sharp
juliet ?
oh , no .
he &apos;s really spent this time getting his life
hasn &apos;t he ? uh @-@ huh .
and here i thought all the times he wanted me to come out here ,
he was up to no good .
i love saying &quot; i told you so . &quot;
well , you have a right to .
i &apos;m proud of you .
you &apos;ve always held this family together .
all right .
well , i &apos;m glad you let me .
i &apos;ll see you at grandfather &apos;s . i &apos;m gonna say bye to dad .
okay .
maybe tell him the good news ?
i &apos;ll call you a car .
okay .
do you know that once upon a time ,
thanksgiving was my favorite holiday ?
i guess we should know better at this point .
at least serena &apos;s safe for now .
did you find jenny ?
she texted she was on her way back to her mother &apos;s .
oh , good .
listen , lil , i don &apos;t totally understand this ,
but i @-@ i think jenny had something to do
with what happened to serena .
well , whatever happened , um ,
serena did what she did .
and if anyone should accept responsibility , it &apos;s me .
it was my job to raise my daughter
to make the right choices
when life didn &apos;t go as planned ,
and i failed .
parenting can only go so far .
and you and i couldn &apos;t be any more different
in that regard .
yet we both have daughters we can &apos;t control .
hey , what do you say to packing up some of this dinner
we never had and , um ,
spending the rest of the holiday at ostroff with the family ?
oh , my gosh .
oh ! you know what ? i have one stop to make ,
and then i &apos;ll meet you there , okay ?
absolutely .
how many times do i have to go courtney love on your ass
before you get the message ? i don &apos;t want you here !
the girl in gossip girl &apos;s blast isn &apos;t serena .
what ?
it &apos;s juliet .
we had a plan to turn everyone against her .
when you and chuck were exposed at his party , that was me .
you ?
and while i was doing that , juliet was kissing dan and nate .
we were both dressed exactly like serena .
this is from her costume ,
and it &apos;s what she wore in those photos .
that &apos;s a pretty tall tale from a not too reliable source .
blair , what reason do i have to come clean ?
like it or not , you know me ,
and you know that i love a good game as much as the next girl ,
but i would never want to hurt serena for real .
juliet did ,
and she used vanessa and me to do it .
are you willing to go double agent ,
help me bring juliet down ?
i wish i could , but you were right
in banishing me .
i thought i could change , and i didn &apos;t .
so i think the best thing for me to do is go ...
and stay gone .
thanksgiving without jenny humphrey ...
what fun would that be ?
juliet &apos;s apartment &apos;s empty .
i &apos;m pretty sure she left town .
good luck .
during the holidays ,
we call customary patterns of behavior tradition .
and like any pattern , once established ,
they are not easily broken .
right on time .
i like that .
you couldn &apos;t have waited till tomorrow ?
no , i couldn &apos;t .
i assume this will be enough to protect my daughter &apos;s history .
like we talked about last week ,
as long as the check arrives every month ,
the past stays in the past .
oh , and ...
i heard about serena .
i am so , so sorry .
at least she &apos;s getting the help that she needs .
i &apos;m a firm believer in people facing what they &apos;ve done .
happy thanksgiving .
other times , we convince ourselves
we can start new traditions ...
really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time .
yeah .
just in time , too , right ?
just in time for what ?
your father &apos;s parole .
he was talking about how much it &apos;ll mean to the parole board
to hear who he &apos;s going home to .
and with your mom by his side , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll get out .
yeah .
thanks . i &apos;ll see you later .
only to realize it wouldn &apos;t be a tradition if it changed .
i didn &apos;t order anything .
永远的 b
祝你这次还能侥幸糊弄过去
mom ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i think i &apos;m gonna come home after all .
can you pick me up ? i &apos;m gonna take the last train .
hey . did you find what you needed ?
yes .
other times ,
ever things we never realized were traditions
can become one .
whatever happens from here on out ,
we &apos;ll handle it together , okay ?
but the best kinds of traditions
are the ones that bring people together ,
even under the most unlikely of circumstances .
vanessa ?
oh . blair .
i owe you an apology .
juliet may have been behind serena &apos;s overdose ,
and i have no intention of letting it go unavenged .
i need your help to find her and extract a confession .
are you in ?
aren &apos;t i about the last person you &apos;d want helping you ?
you love serena , don &apos;t you ?
so we have something in common .
what do you say we find that bitch
and get his little friend here justice ?
come together right now .
