sheldon , you &apos;re wrong .
wolverine was not born with bone claws .
howard ,
you know me to be a very smart man .
don &apos;t you think if i were wrong , i &apos;d know it ?
okay , first of all ...
give it up , dude .
you &apos;re arguing with a crazy person .
i &apos;m not crazy .
my mother had me tested .
hey , guys .
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ? it &apos;s new comic book night .
yeah , but since you and penny finally hooked up , we thought
you two would be having bouncy naked yum @-@ yum night .
there &apos;s more to life than sex , raj .
okay , who had &quot; leonard flames out with penny in less than 24 hours &quot; ?
i did .
nothing flamed out .
we don &apos;t have to have sex every night , you know .
you don &apos;t have to , but it &apos;s highly recommended .
yeah , take advantage of that window of opportunity
before it slams shut on your little dinky .
it &apos;s not a matter of opptunity .
we &apos;re getting to know each other .
there &apos;s a learning curve .
what &apos;s there to learn ?
you get naked , do nasty things to each other ,
then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami .
easy peasy .
perhaps what leonard
is oblique referring to
is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction .
okay , who had &quot; leonard gets a floppy disk &quot; ?
oh , a clever , albeit obsolete , euphemism
for insufficient blood flow the male sex organ .
nothing like that happened , all right ?
the sex was ... just fine .
just fine ?
oh , dude , the fourth harry potter movie was &quot; just fine . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying it was bad .
i &apos;m just saying it ... wasn &apos;t great .
okay , when you say &quot; it wasn &apos;great , &quot;
do you mean for both of you ?
because we can totally see it not being great for her .
am i right ?
oh , yeah .
to tell you the truth , i think we were both a little ...
i don &apos;t know .
disappointed ? let down ?
ashamed ? horrified ? repulsed ?
all i know is , it wasn &apos;t the way i dreamed it would be .
sex is never the way i dream it &apos;s gonna be .
that &apos;s because in your dreams ,
you &apos;re a horse from the waist down .
excuse me , wolverine : origin .
miniseries issue two , page 22 .
retractable bone claws .
if you people spent less time thinking about sex
and more time concentrating on comic books ,
we &apos;d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments .
sheldon , dinner &apos;s here .
tandoori palace ?
no , we went somewhere new .
you &apos;re good naturedly ribbing me , aren &apos;t you ?
no , look , mumbai palace .
why ?
why would we change ?
we had a perfectly good palace .
tandoori palace is our palace .
trust me , this will be just fine .
you are the authority
on &quot; just fine . &quot;
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it &apos;s actually &quot; not bad , but not great . &quot;
what are they talking about ?
i don &apos;t know .
i know .
as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware ...
duh @-@ duh @-@ duh @-@ duh @-@ duh @-@ duh .
if that &apos;s morse code ,
that &apos;s terrible .
as i was saying , you and leonard had
a disappointing sexual encounter .
earlier this evening ,
leonard characterized as &quot; just fine . &quot;
so what you &apos;re seeing here is a continuation
of the mocking that followed .
okay , yeah , well ,
i &apos;m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere .
maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside .
penny , wait .
what is wrong with you ?
i sense i may have crossed some sort of line .
yeah , you ...
no , don &apos;t tell him .
let &apos;s see if he can figure it out .
ugh , i am so embarrassed !
please don &apos;t be mad .
what did you tell them ?
nothing bad , just that last night was fine .
fine ? you said it was fine ?
yeah , it &apos;s a perfectly good word .
you put it in front of &quot; wine &quot; or &quot; dining , &quot;
and you &apos;ve really got something .
okay , well , let me ask you this :
how was last night for you ?
it was ... okay .
okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s a perfectly good word .
i mean , you put it in front of &quot; dokay &quot;
and you really got something .
all right , look , let &apos;s not overreact , you know .
for a lot of couples , it takes time
to get to know each other &apos;s rhythms .
learn what the other person was and likes .
so , you &apos;ve been through this before ?
no .
okay @-@ dokay .
you know , i think this is one of those things where
talking about it is not going to make it better .
want a glass of wine ?
so much . okay
see , we should &apos;ve done this last night .
you know , have a little wine , take the edge off .
actually , ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction
in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors
of inhibitory neurotranmitters like gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid .
don &apos;t talk , just drink .
no , you &apos;re misunderstanding .
a shiksa goddess isn &apos;t an actual goddess .
and we don &apos;t pray to them .
we prey on them .
whatever , dude .
the point is , leonard &apos;s got one and you don &apos;t .
is this it
it was inappropriate to discuss leonard and penny &apos;s sex life
in front of leonard and penny .
oh , good !
now i can eat .
what &apos;s that ?
sounds like a cricket . hang on .
based on the number of chirps per minute
and the ambient temperature in this room ,
it is a snowy tree cricket .
oh , give me a freakin &apos; break .
how could you possibly know that ?
in 1890 , emile dolbear
determined that there was
a fixed relationship between the number
of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket
and the ambient temperature .
a precise relationship that is not present
with ordinary field crickets .
how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is ?
under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard ,
i &apos;ve had unilateral control of thermostat
ever since the sweaty night of &apos; 06 .
ok , you were right about wolverine and bone claws ,
but you &apos;re wrong about the cricket .
howard , don &apos;t embarrass yourself .
the science chirps for itself .
humorous word play .
no , no , not this time .
i know insects , my friend .
i spent many
childhood years capturing them with nets ,
putting them in glass jars , sticking pins through them ,
mounting them on corrugated cardboard with dymo labels
underneath , identifying the genus and species .
in latin .
oh , dude , you are never getting a shiksa goddess .
that is a snowy tree cricket .
oecanthus fultoni .
i was done with latin by fifth grade .
okay , okay , tell you what .
i am willing to bet anything
that &apos;s an ordinary field cricket .
i can &apos;t take your money .
what &apos;s the matter , you chicken ?
i &apos;ve always found that an inappropriate slur .
chickens are not by nature ,
at all timid .
in fact , when i was young ,
my neighbor &apos;s chiken got loose
and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house .
chickens can &apos;t climb trees .
thank god .
okay ,
i believe a chicken made you his bitch .
but the cricket thing , i don &apos;t buy .
bet me .
fair enough .
what stakes do you propose ?
i would put my fantastic four of no. 48 first appearance of silver surfer ,
against your flash 123,
the classic flash of two worlds issue .
all right , you have a wager .
hmm . great .
now how are you going to settle it , hmm ?
there is no way to determine the species
of the criet without examining it .
i wonder what the non @-@ pathetic people are doing tonight .
more wine ?
hit me .
i don &apos;t see anything .
shh !
hallway .
one at a time .
what was that ?
my stomach .
indian food doesn &apos;t agree with me .
ironic , isn &apos;t it ?
shh !
elevator shaft .
help me open it .
are you crazy ?
we can &apos;t go down empty elevator shaft .
fine , if you don &apos;t want to proceed ,
then you forfeit the bet ,
and i &apos;ll take possession of your fantastic four .
let &apos;s open her up .
are you bothered that i can so easily manipulate you ?
don &apos;t push me , sheldon .
i may be small , but i took kung fu when i was 13,
and i remember a good deal of it .
oh , really ?
well , i grew up with an older brother
and a very contentious twin sister .
and i believe i could easily best you
in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies , swirlies
or the classic &quot; why are you hitting yourself ? &quot;
ooh , big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken .
what are we drinking now ?
peppermint schnapps .
why would you buy peppermint schnapps ?
because i like peppermint ,
and it &apos;s fun to say schnapps .
hey , leonard ?
what ?
schnapps .
schnapps .
you &apos;re right , that is fun .
be careful .
if i were not being careful ,
your telling me to be careful would not make me careful .
stairwell .
uh @-@ oh , flashlight went out .
i need some batteries .
fellas ?
hello ?
it &apos;s really dark down here .
oh , sweetie .
you really can &apos;t hold your liquor , can you ?
i &apos;m okay .
just a little mouthwash ,
and then i &apos;m gonna rock your world .
are you okay ?
ugh , toby , what did you do in a past life
to be so disgusting now ?
his name isn &apos;t toby .
toby is an absurd name for a cricket .
what would you name him ?
an appropriate cricket name .
for example , jiminy .
all right ,
sheldon , here we go .
kleingast &apos;s field guide to north american insects .
hey toby .
right here .
see it ?
the common field cricket ,
ak gryllus assimilis ,
which is latin for &quot; suck it , you lose . &quot;
hang on .
voil√† .
the snowy tree cricket .
aka oecanthus fultoni ,
which is latin for i &apos;ll suck nothing .
of course i &apos;m joking
because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo .
that is not toby ,
this is toby .
raj , what do you think ?
oh , i really don &apos;t care anymore .
god , i had the most horrible night .
obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess .
shiksa . shik @-@ sa .
forgive me .
yiddish was not spoken in east texas .
and if it was , it wasn &apos;t spoken for long .
yeah , fine , whatever .
the point is , you &apos;re wrong again .
we haven &apos;t established that i &apos;m wrong once . all right .
tell you what . let &apos;s go down
to the entomology department
and let professor crawley tell us
what kind of cricket toby is .
he &apos;s a snowy tree cricket ,
and his name is jiminy .
i bet i could throw a rock in this room
and come up with three better friends .
holy crap .
it &apos;s like silence of the lambs down here .
don &apos;t do that .
you &apos;re such a girl .
the &apos;re just bugs .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t like bugs , okay ?
they freak me out .
interesting
you &apos;re afraid of insects and women .
ladybugs must render you catatonic .
it was a joke .
i made it to lessen your discomfort .
you &apos;re welcome .
don &apos;t knock .
just walk in .
why be polite to the world &apos;s leading expert
on the dung beetle ?
excuse me ,
are you professor crawley ?
who wants to know ?
i &apos;m dr. cooper from the physics department .
couldn &apos;t wait , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
i haven &apos;t even packed yet ,
and you &apos;re already measuring my lab
for one of your godless laser machines .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
we just want to ask you a question .
let me ask you one first .
what &apos;s a world renowned entomologist
with a doctorate
and 20 years of experience to do with his life
when the university cuts off the funding for his lab , huh ?
ask rhetorical questions
that make people uncomfortable ?
what &apos;s your deal ?
are they planning to outsource my job to bangalore ?
i &apos;m from new delhi .
maybe you should find another entomologist .
no , no . we &apos;re here . let &apos;s settle this .
professor , can you identify our cricket ?
of course i can .
i can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet .
not that that &apos;s going
to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in oxnard .
and we &apos;re not talking
oxnard at the beach . no !
we &apos;re talking oxnard
in the onion fields .
well , could you look at toby ?
toby ?
what a stupid name for a cricket .
told ya .
it &apos;s a field cricket .
yes !
no , no , wait .
dr. crawley , are you sure ?
young man , i &apos;ve been studying insects since i was eight years old .
you know what they used to call me in school ?
creepy crawley .
cruel as that may be ,
but this is not in itself a credential .
let me show you something .
see that ?
that &apos;s a crawley &apos;s dung beetle .
i discovered it after spending six months slogging
through a bornean rain forest ,
while my wife was back home shacking up with a two @-@ bit ornithologist
who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot @-@ cut jeans !
so , when i tell you that it &apos;s a common field cricket ,
you can take that to the damn bank !
&apos;cause god knows i can &apos;t !
that tramp took me for everything !
well , apparently , i was wrong .
congratulations .
enjoy oxnard .
i &apos;m sure your daughter &apos;s looking forward to having you .
oh , hey , sheldon .
what you got there ? new comic book ?
old comic book .
i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box .
what do you have a safe deposit box for ?
old comic books .
i lost this to wolowitz
in an ill @-@ considered cricket wager .
what , do they have wii cricket now ?
that can &apos;t be very popular .
penny , i &apos;d rather not talk about it .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i &apos;m not feeling so hot either .
why would that make me feel better ?
i don &apos;t know , empathy ?
anyway , i &apos;m just saying ,
that you &apos;re feeling upset about something with howard ,
and i &apos;m upset about something with leonard .
yes
yes , the disappointing sex .
that &apos;s an inexact parallel .
you and leonard can always return to being friends ,
whereas i can never return to a state
in which wolowitz has not bested me
like mrs. riley &apos;s chicken .
what &apos;s mrs. riley &apos;s chicken ?
a chicken that was owned by mrsriley .
okay , forget the chicken .
well , i wish i could .
no , no .
you may be right about me and leonard .
of course i &apos;m right .
what are the odds i &apos;d be wrong twice in one week ?
no , i mean , we can always go back to being friends .
i just said that .
this conversation has started to circle.meeting adjourned .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , you &apos;d like to catch up on the events of the day . all right
well , there was a half @-@ hour wait at the bank
to get into my safe deposit box ,
i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems ,
and , oh , yes ,
in a moment filled with biblical resonance ,
pride wentth before my fall ,
causing my flash 123 to go with to wolowitz .
wait a minute .
you talked to penny about our sex life ?
leonard , it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial .
i lost a bet to wolowitz .
right , right .
you &apos;re saying you talked to penny ?
ye @-@ yes .
interesting .
hardly .
excuse me .
have i crossed some sort of line again ?
little bit .
oh , who cares ?
uh , what did sheldon say to you ?
not a lot .
just that we always have the option of going back to being friends .
is that what you want ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , you have to admit
things seemed simpler when we were just friends .
i guess .
it would take the pressure off .
it would , wouldn &apos;t it ?
so , we &apos;ll just be friends .
good .
good .
come here .
