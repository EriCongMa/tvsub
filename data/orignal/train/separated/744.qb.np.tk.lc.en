he brewed me like a fine chamomile .
oh , so that was you .
i thought that was a couple bums fighting .
it wasn &apos;t . it was me having sex .
i left my body , went up to heaven , saw my grandparents ,
thought it was weird that i saw my grandparents ,
came back down , i became a werewolf ,
i scared some teenagers .
i came back into my body .
only thing is ,
he thinks my name is katie .
and that i &apos;m a dancer
and / or something involving puppets .
katie ?
hey , sam .
these are my roommates .
hey , uh , katie , we &apos;re running late for dance rehearsal .

i got to go .
katie &apos;s an animal .

i love being katie .
vintage katie .
like an animal you are .
katie knows how the sausage gets made .
ew .
katie ... has a job , y &apos;all .
i think i should just stay katie .
maybe you should watch a cautionary tale
that i like to call the nutty professor .
what &apos;s katie gonna do , nick ?
she &apos;s got some pretty dark needs .
well , i hope you don &apos;t like him ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re not coming back from ,
&quot; just kidding . my name is actually jess . &quot;
&quot; hey , i got your number from nick .
want to hang ? &quot;
what &apos;s this ?
i gave your number to the guy
that you like from the bar . you asked me to .
oh , my god .
i forgot .
i &apos;ve never had two guys into me before .
what &apos;s happening ?
jess , i &apos;m gonna tell you what &apos;s happening .
okay , there comes a time
in every person &apos;s life when ...
for no reason whatsoever they are irresistible to the opposite sex .
for me , it was the third night of hanukkah &apos; 96,
which i like to refer to as the night of the shoshannas .
for me , it &apos;s every time i jet ski .
this is not fair .
it is gonna take all of my game
to sleep with winston &apos;s sister .
what ?
and then there &apos;s you ,
who has this raw animal magnetism
just dropped in her lap like a sack of taters .
what a waste .
i &apos;m pretty sure it is not a waste .
oh , it &apos;s a waste .
jess , look , you don &apos;t have the skill to juggle men .
you wear a cardigan on top of another cardigan .
we all know you &apos;re not the best with doorknobs .
you can barely hold one thing in each hand .
you tripped the other day just standing there .
what &apos;s happening ?
okay , but katie can juggle men .
she &apos;s out the door
before you even know your wallet &apos;s gone , son .
he wants to cook for me .
is there a hot way of saying
i don &apos;t feel sexy after i &apos;ve had a lot of cheese ?
i would say no .
didn &apos;t know this was a butter knife type of place .
don &apos;t worry , the team &apos;s paying .
if anybody asks , you &apos;re the ball boy .
hey , coach , put me in .
schmidt .
schmidt , what the hell are you doing here ?
come on , move over . hey , y &apos;all .
everybody scooch , a little scoochie down .
okay , teamwork . defense .
a lot of money that i want to deposit into your tyra banks .
if he touches your sister ,
i &apos;m gonna stop paying your cell phone bill .
the l.a. sparks .
so many sparks in one place ,
you &apos;re about to start the world &apos;s sexiest fire .
am i right ?
andy and i have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts .
come to the professor . let me see .
he says , &quot; can &apos;t stop thinking
about what you &apos;re gonna wear tonight . &quot;
how do i respond ?
with a simple ...
&quot; or not wear . &quot;
okay .
okay ?
&quot; or not wear
because sex happens naked . &quot;
send .
okay , let me help you with that .
&quot; just kidding .

you did something stupid .
so tell her you &apos;re sorry .
now i know why people get annoyed with me .
it &apos;s hard to talk to us .
hey , you know , i can &apos;t believe she asked nick
for your number and then ...
yeah , yeah , you know what , man ?

she was so beautiful with all that swearing , but you know what ?
i &apos;m not jenny mccarthy .
i know that now .
i &apos;m back on the grid , nick .
you know , i always wanted to be kurt loder .
kurt loder ? he never even went to the spring break house .
he was stuck in new york , talking to pearl jam .
he is the elder statesman of our generation .
why are you making me a drink ?
you never bring work home .
all right , this is gonna sound really weird ,
but in the future i might do something really bad to you ,
and i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
do you like old @-@ fashioneds , jess ?
i &apos;ve actually always wanted to try one .
how did you know ?
what are you gonna do to me ?
i don &apos;t know .

i still forgive you .
sam , hi .
