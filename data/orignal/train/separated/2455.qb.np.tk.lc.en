kai is trapped in a 1903 prison world .
so kai &apos;s gone ?
as in for good .
i &apos;m pregnant .
marry me .
yes !
i &apos;ve always wanted a family .
it &apos;s never gonna happen for me .
before the 1900s , lily fell in with a group of witches
that were cast out of the gemini coven .
heretics are ruthless ,
vampires with witch power .
they can never be allowed to escape .
you turned me and left me on a passenger ship
full of headless corpses .
no . the night i turned you ,
my friends and i were captured by the gemini coven .
the ascendant is the only thing that can get my people back .
if i was human , we wouldn &apos;t work .
exactly .
the cure to vampirism .
i left it out for you to find
since damon was never going to offer it to you .
why would you keep it a secret from me ?
i &apos;m so in love with you and i don &apos;t want to lose you .
i don &apos;t want to live without you either .
you &apos;re gonna take the cure , elena .
and i &apos;m gonna take it with you .
don &apos;t tell me-- you &apos;ve bailed on your shift ,
and you &apos;re headed here to help me grade papers .
you know me so well ,
except for the part where i would rather be covered
in mrs. robinson &apos;s intestinal bile
than grading term papers .
so i &apos;ll take that as a no .
i just realized that
tonight is my last shift as a single woman .
i can &apos;t wait to marry you .
and i am counting the days .
me , too .
dr. laughlin ?
yes .
i &apos;m officer baker .
is there somewhere private we can speak ?
sure .
what &apos;s this about ?
i &apos;m here regarding professor saltzman .
i understand you two are engaged to be married .
is something wrong ?
nope .
everything
is just right .
oh--oh , my god . no . no . no . i don &apos;t think you should ...
surprise !
no , no , no . this is not really happening .
happy bachelorette !
happy bachelorette !
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
happy bachelor party !
an entire diner to ourselves ?
actual heaven .
if caroline were here , we would be planning a spa day .
but now she &apos;s m.i.a.
understandable , considering .
so i figured we &apos;d just stuff our faces .
you &apos;re geniuses .
except aren &apos;t you a vegetarian ?
bonnie , don &apos;t ruin it .
i &apos;m just saying that &apos;s not exactly a garden burger .
the baby is not ok with the no meat thing .
besides , it &apos;s my party , and i &apos;ll eat what i want to .
i do wish this was vodka , though .
right .
i don &apos;t want to know what ric &apos;s doing , do i ?
probably at the movies .
yeah , or--or mini golf .
i need ketchup .
so are we gonna talk about it ?
what ?
seriously ?
you &apos;re gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you .
i know about the cure , elena .
you do ?
how is it even possible ?
damon called me last night ,
and he told me everything ,
including his insane plan to take it with you .
damon called you ?
he needed someone to talk to after you left
the conversation without telling him
what you were thinking .
that &apos;s not exactly how it happened .
and i quote-- &quot; she stared at me like i was an alien
and then basically teleported out of the room . &quot;
damon salvatore stands in front of you
and tells you that he wants to become a human again .
wouldn &apos;t you freak out ?
i just--i needed some time to process .
i mean , 24 hours ago , i didn &apos;t even think
it was possible to become a human again .
but you want to be a human again .
yeah .
well , i did .
honestly , it &apos;s all just very complicated right now .
you guys aren &apos;t full , are you ?
what do you mean you offered to take the cure ?
i just--i was standing there ,
and it just sort of came out .
ok . so how the hell does that even work ?
it &apos;s easy .
elena guzzles it , goes back to her old human self ,
i feed on her , and as long as no one sucks it out of me ,
then we grow old and die of the common cold .
ok . so you screwed up , and now you &apos;re freaking out .
i didn &apos;t screw up .
damon , if you take that cure ,
you can never be a vampire ever again .
all right ?
listen to me .
you &apos;re writing checks your ass can &apos;t cash , all right ?
now you &apos;re getting cold feet .
are you projecting ?
you seriously want to be a human ?
i want to be with elena .
and what did stefan say ?
do you honestly want to spend
your last night as a single man debating my existential crisis ?
damon , tell me you told your brother of 166 years
that you &apos;re planning on becoming human .
i will .
eventually .
to you .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
well , considering the guy who lives here
tried to kill us a few days ago , i don &apos;t blame you .
yeah , but we &apos;re here for ric , right ?
i &apos;m here for the free booze .
beer plus pain meds equals another trip to the hospital .
you chose now to learn math ?
who the hell invited you ?
damon .
never been to a bachelor party before .
i can see the appeal .
where &apos;s stefan ?
don &apos;t know , don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s caroline ,
but , duh , you knew that because you called ,
so leave a message , and i &apos;ll call you back .
bye !
you &apos;re so happy in your voicemail .
speaking of happy ,
that thumping bass you hear in the background ,
that &apos;s , um , damon &apos;s genius idea to host ric &apos;s bachelor party
despite the fact that our mother
apparently lives here now ,
who i &apos;ve been ducking , by the way ,
in case you haven &apos;t noticed .
i guess what i &apos;m saying is call me back .
otherwise , i &apos;m gonna start running out of reasons
to avoid everything that is going on in my life right now .
kind of like what you &apos;re doing ,
which is completely understandable
but just really crappy timing for me and my problems .
you should be here .
come home .
that was utterly adorable .
what are you doing in my bedroom ?
oh , believe me , there are a number of places i &apos;d rather be--
strapped to a gurney , having my spleen cut out for instance .
unfortunately for me , i &apos;m here
because your mother needs your help .
my mother ?
apparently , her beloved ascendant &apos;s been destroyed .
she &apos;s in bad shape .
could use a bit of your time .
what the hell do you know about my mother ?
hello , mother .
i think it &apos;s time you and i have a talk .
this is entirely unnecessary .
i was merely getting a breath of fresh air .
what you got there , a junkie tic ?
i have the same thing .
it &apos;s funny how that works , isn &apos;t it ?
what is this , some kind of ...
mother @-@ son bonding experiment ?
no , no . you made your feelings for me perfectly clear
when you had to spin a web of lies to snap my humanity back on .
i don &apos;t know what enzo told you ,
but i assure you i &apos;m fine .
you know , enzo told me a lot of things ,
including that after losing all hope of getting your friends back
you went off the deep end last night .
a momentary lapse .
i mean , i figured since you passed the ripper gene on to me--
thank you for that , by the way--
we could talk about it .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
you know
personally when i start feeling like i &apos;m gonna go over the edge ,
i begin to salivate in the back of my mouth .
does that ever happen to you ?
and then my veins , they begin to itch uncontrollably ,
and the hunger consumes me--
every sound , every scent .
the world around me falls apart ,
and all i can hear is the pulsing
of someone &apos;s blood ,
and all i feel is that it belongs to me .
but i guess you don &apos;t
have that problem , right ?
drinking yourself to death .
that your big plan for the future ?
just taking a page from your playbook .
oh , sorry . all the pages .
how about we get out of here ?
come on .
i &apos;ll drive you home .
how &apos;s the deputy training program ?
is that why you &apos;re being a dick ?
part of it .
remember , i &apos;m on injured reserve ,
so you &apos;ll have to fill me in .
deputy taylor finally stopped calling me cupcake .
i guess that &apos;s progress .
maybe that &apos;s because deputy taylor &apos;s
on medical leave for a week
after you kicked his ass in front of the trainees .
yeah ? well , you know what ? he had it coming .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
are you that incapable of not raging out ?
this program was a chance for you to do something with your life .
no . that &apos;s what it is for you
because i realized one day doing this job
might mean that i have to shoot someone ,
to kill them , and i don &apos;t ever want to be a werewolf again .
it doesn &apos;t have to be like that , ty .
you just need some self @-@ control .
watch yourself , matt .
control it , ty . come on .
you &apos;re not worth it .
where are you ,
and please tell me you &apos;re with the stripper .
picture that and then picture the exact opposite .
i &apos;m with our mother .
now i don &apos;t want to picture anything .
did you know that she was the one who turned enzo ?
that &apos;s mathematically impossible .
enzo turned in 190--
1903 . apparently , they were on a boat
together back to new york harbor .
he was sick , and she took pity on him .
and here we thought she didn &apos;t have a maternal bone in her body .
she also has a little bit of a ripper thing going on .
that little stunt you pulled with the ascendant
put her in a blood tizzy .
well , then why is she out and about ?
lock her ass up and rejoin the party , brother .
yeah , i will , if it comes to that .
anything else ?
nope .
just love to mom . heh . kidding .
see ? now that &apos;s what i call a missed opportunity .
perfect time to tell your brother
you &apos;re hanging up your fangs for a pair of khakis .
no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
yes , you do .
i might have plied alaric with enough alcohol
to slur the news into my ear .
well , you are the last person who gets to criticize me
for withholding information ,
my brother from the same mother .
you were gonna tell me lily turned you ?
yeah , once you mastered the art of returning phone calls .
i &apos;ve been busy .
what , with the prospect of taking the cure ?
no point in agonizing . you won &apos;t go through with it .
says who ?
you .
you &apos;re selfish , damon .
being human isn &apos;t what you really want .
i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . i like that about you .
a man should be consistent ,
but take it from someone who you left
to burn to death in order to save your own skin ,
no one changes that much ,
even under the magical influence of elena gilbert .
anyway , cheers , mate .
so basically , damon did the vampire version
of a marriage proposal , and you just walked away .
i said i would think about it .
why are we talking about me ?
this is your party .
trust me , i would much rather talk about that
than the fact that i have yet to find a nonhideous wedding gown
or that i can &apos;t ask my sister to be my maid of honor
because she won &apos;t return my phone calls
or the fact that i cannot stop eating
literally , like , ever .
so big decision . go .
i think you should take it .
decision made .
what if i miss the perks ?
like compelling the owner of a diner
to close early for us ,
or what if i get sick ?
or what if the human you doesn &apos;t love damon anymore ?
someone had to say it .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
being supernatural doesn &apos;t change who you are .
i should know . i &apos;m an ex @-@ witch
who &apos;s about to marry an ex @-@ vampire .
deep down , you know who you are and what you want .
love &apos;s always gonna require a huge leap of faith ,
a big scary leap over a hot pit of lava ,
and you might end up heartbroken ,
but you might be the happiest person on the face of the earth .
personally , i &apos;m glad i took that leap .
speak of the devil .
let me guess-- you got a lap dance ,
and now you feel guilty .
how &apos;d you know ?
very funny .
you may have partied us under the table ,
but at least i &apos;m on a junk food high .
is that why you &apos;re walking around town , eating french fries ?
look up .
what are you doing up there ?
oh , i &apos;m just clearing my head .
asked a girl a really big question last night .
she just sort of left me hanging .
what a flake .
that &apos;s all right .
she &apos;s probably just doing some soul searching .
want some ?
you deliver ?
see ? sublimating can be fun .
you &apos;re mocking me .
i am not mocking you .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m teaching you how to divert
an instinctual impulse into a socially acceptable activity .
look . it &apos;s either this or squirrel blood
unless you &apos;re a rabbit person .
you ever try to hunt a rabbit ?
humbling .
imagine cherishing something for 150 years
and then imagine that being ripped away from you .
believe me , it &apos;s devastating .
my friends are gone .
let me grieve .
your grief is attracting a lot of attention ,
and you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m not damon
because you would be locked in a cell by now .
but not you .
you feel the need to connect ,
or is this strictly a ripper @-@ to @-@ ripper pep talk ?
reformed ripper ,
who happens to think this relationship is worth saving .
no . no . i can &apos;t do this .
you were the only one
who was able to flip my humanity back on .
damon fed me a story .
and it worked !
all i &apos;m saying is maybe deep down
you still feel something for me .
stefan ,
the woman who raised you
lived under the hand of a cheating , abusive husband .
she was weak , she got sick and died ,
and then a new lily was born ,
a powerful lily who took what she wanted
and found a family that embraced her ,
so when i look at you ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love you .
it &apos;s that i &apos;m reminded of that pathetic woman
when all i want to do is forget that she ever existed .
well , then let &apos;s start over ,
clean slate ,
and let me help you get through this .
we can start something new .
you just--
you have to trust me .
you never could look me in the eye when you were telling me a lie .
sorry about the mess .
i love it up here .
soak it in while you can
and load up on fries
because transfat is no friend to humans .
did you mean it when you told me you &apos;d take the cure ,
or were you just afraid that
you were gonna lose me ?
honestly , a bit of both .
yeah . well , here &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
i &apos;m afraid that if we do take it
you &apos;ll lose something else that you love ,
being a vampire ,
and we &apos;re not gonna be happy if you resent me
for the rest of our lives .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m pretty sexy when i &apos;m resentful .
seriously . come on , damon .
are you ready to give all this up ?
to be continued .
i want to show you something .
where are we going ?
well , down for starters
unless you want to wuss out
and take the stairs .
you only live once , right ?
once or twice .
you know , it &apos;s bad form to drink
a thousand @-@ dollar bottle of bourbon all by yourself .
so you &apos;re really doing this , huh ,
taking the plunge ,
starting a family here ?
yeah . guess that &apos;s the plan .
want some drink advice ?
sure .
i &apos;ve got 30 stitches in my side .
all my friends are killers except you .
you &apos;re a human ,
which means it &apos;s a miracle you &apos;re still alive .
you &apos;re a dick if you &apos;re ok with bringing a kid into this .
well , if that &apos;s your bachelor toast , it really sucks .
leave town . that &apos;s my advice .
take your happy fiancee ,
your unborn baby , and your miracle life
and get out
before it &apos;s too late .
you left dinner early because you weren &apos;t feeling well .
you won &apos;t remember anything unusual
that happened here tonight .
now go home .
broken glassware ,
the overwhelming scent of fresh blood .
i see the family reunion went without a hitch .
and what the hell took you so long ?
i had to compel the entire restaurant myself .
i was looking for damon .
word is that he took off to find elena .
yeah . well , he &apos;s not picking up his cell phone right now ,
which means it &apos;s just you and me .
just you and me .
has a nice ring to it , doesn &apos;t it ?
suppose we ought to get used to it .
what the hell are you talking about ?
that &apos;s right .
you haven &apos;t heard .
damon has the cure ,
and if we &apos;re to believe his bluster ,
he plans on taking it with elena .
i think i would know if my brother
were planning on turning human .
based on the look of shock on your face ,
you don &apos;t .
so we can either stand here
and debate the merits of damon &apos;s word ,
or we can split up and find your mum
before she rips their heads off .
which is it gonna be ?
bad news . damon hijacked elena ,
so do you want to take this party somewhere else ?
yes , to my bed if i can walk .
oh , my god .
good evening , miss bennett .
i was out for a walk , and i saw you through the window ,
and i thought ,
&quot; i know her .
that young lady ruined my life . &quot;
who is this ?
lily salvatore .
be careful .
bonnie destroyed something very dear to me ,
and now all i feel is insatiable hunger .
i didn &apos;t do it to spite you , lily .
i did it to keep kai trapped .
surely there &apos;s another way to rescue my friends .
there is no other way , and even if i could help ,
i wouldn &apos;t .
now let it go
and get out .
your mistake .
no , please !
i &apos;m pregnant !
twins .
what ?
good luck to you .
stay calm . i &apos;m gonna help you .
what &apos;s your favorite thing about being a vampire ?
well , i guess if i had to choose one thing ,
it would be that i can heal people .
said no vampire ever .
ok . well , then enlighten me .
i like all of it--
the speed , the feed ,
everything so heightened ,
and eternally looking great
in a black leather jacket &apos;s not the worst thing .
i &apos;m forgetting something , though .
oh , i remember .
getting in people &apos;s heads is quite a bit of fun , too .
my old house .
you won &apos;t remember this , but this is the first place
i ever kissed you .
another very happy memory ric scrubbed from your brain .
but this isn &apos;t real .
it &apos;s a fantasy .
you put this in my brain .
isn &apos;t that the point ?
i mean , as epic as this life is ,
we &apos;d be giving up so much more if we didn &apos;t do this .
i &apos;ve had so much fantasy in my life , elena ,
enough for 100 lifetimes .
i &apos;d give it all up for one life with you .
you brought it with you .
well , i wasn &apos;t gonna leave it in the soap dish .
i want this , damon .
no matter how much it scares me ,
i can &apos;t pretend that i don &apos;t .
i know you do .
you &apos;ve wanted this since the day you became a vampire .
for you , there &apos;s no going back .
that &apos;s never been my style .
and you &apos;re impulsive and reckless !
and madly in love with you
forever , no matter how long that &apos;s gonna be ,
and taking this cure , elena , won &apos;t change that .
i &apos;m ready for a little reality if you are .
i love you .
till death do us part .
bottoms up .
how do you feel ?
i don &apos;t know . i ...
i kind of feel ...
it all looks so good .
so what looks good ?
sorry .
you first .
how about eggplant parmesan ?
you &apos;re an eggplant girl , huh ?
is that bad ?
you don &apos;t like eggplant .
love it . just taking notes ,
mental notes .
for what ? for a second date ?
i was thinking 5 @-@ year anniversary .
hang on . i &apos;m gonna get you home .
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
elena , hey .
you scared the crap out of me .
i think i &apos;m--i &apos;m ok .
what happened ?
we were on our first date .
what ?
yeah .
damon ! damon--i &apos;m getting-- i &apos;m getting my memories back .
damon , the cure , it undid the compulsion . i ...
it worked .
yeah . well , wait .
it &apos;s not healing .
damon , it &apos;s not healing .
that means it &apos;s-- it worked , it worked .
how you feeling about that ?
i feel--
i feel like i want to kiss you .
hang on .
it &apos;s stefan .
better be good , brother .
elena and i are having a moment .
damon , do not take that cure .
what ?
how do you even know about that ?
lily got away from me ,
so it &apos;s a really bad time to be a human .
what &apos;s going on ?
you were right . we got to lock her up .
what is he saying . i--i can &apos;t hear anymore .
apparently , mama salvatore &apos;s--
i &apos;m sorry , but i won &apos;t be imprisoned again .
i didn &apos;t have to turn into this person .
i kept her at bay for so long ,
but my sons , they ruined everything .
they were just trying to help .
look at me .
they &apos;re not helping !
you &apos;re bleeding .
you took the cure .
you &apos;re human .
you don &apos;t want to feed on me .
yes ...
please .
elena , i do .
no !
no !
really ? come on .
elena !
focus .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
usually , we don &apos;t yank out penetrating objects
in the field , but don &apos;t worry .
here . squeeze my hand if you have trouble breathing .
no squeeze ?
good . that &apos;s really good .
come on . up , up .
no , no . don &apos;t--don &apos;t try and talk .
i heard what she said-- twins--
which means i &apos;m number one on kai &apos;s most wanted list .
congratulations . you have been bumped to number two ,
so thank you for destroying that stupid ascendant ,
and i hope you meant what you said ,
that there &apos;s no way to get out of that prison world .
i promise .
he &apos;s not getting out .
worst bachelorette party ever , right ?
let &apos;s get to the hospital . okay ?
i got to the tunnels .
she came through the grill .
she might still be there .
we &apos;re right outside , so get home .
we &apos;ll deal with her .
elena &apos;s safe . get up .
we need to find lily .
yeah . i &apos;m fine . thanks for asking .
so were you gonna tell me ,
or was it just easier to be your normal , dickish self ?
what do you think ?
i think being a human is the last thing you want .
i want to be with elena , stefan .
do you have any idea what it feels like for me
to have to hear it from enzo ,
to have no say as to whether i lose my brother or not ?
of course i know what it feels like .
why do you think i didn &apos;t tell you ?
can we go find our mother ?
look what you &apos;ve done to your mother .
i &apos;m a mess .
in a few fays or months or years ,
you &apos;ll feel different .
what does it matter if i &apos;m alone ,
terrified of falling off the edge ?
i suppose i &apos;d be like you , wouldn &apos;t i ?
sad and alone .
no , no , no , no , no .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
please don &apos;t do that .
stay alive for us , your sons ,
the ones who i know that deep down inside
you still care about ...
and who still care about you .
you &apos;re looking into my eyes .
you always had such pretty eyes .
you ok ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not my blood . it &apos;s ok .
how--how &apos;s bonnie ?
she &apos;s fine . damon gave her some of his blood .
what about you ? how are--how are you ?
how &apos;s the baby ?
it &apos;s , uh , babies actually .
turns out there &apos;s two of them cooking in there .
twins .
ok .
look . the more the merrier .
even if kai never escapes that prison ,
my family &apos;s gonna try and take them from us .
a new gemini twin merge is the only thing
that can strip kai of his power .
we won &apos;t let them find out .
how is that possible ?
because after the wedding , we &apos;re gonna disappear .
we &apos;re gonna go somewhere where your family can &apos;t find us .
alaric , i can &apos;t ask you to give your whole life up for me .
you , the baby-- babies--
you are my life ,
and all i care about is keeping you safe .
good news from the front lines .
bonnie is ok ,
jo is ok ,
and lily has been laid down for a long winter &apos;s nap .
well , you look lost in thought .
i remember everything , every moment .
it &apos;s like a million tiny ,
little pieces of my heart have fallen back into place .
i remember the moment that we met ,
the moment that we fell in love ,
how much i didn &apos;t want to love you ,
but it was like-- it was like
i was being swept up into a current .
i--i--i was consumed by it .
that &apos;s a good thing , right ?
damon , i remember everything ,
every kiss ,
every conversation .
i still don &apos;t see how that &apos;s bad .
we &apos;ve already had this discussion , damon ,
about the cure on the island .
what ? no . that was totally different .
was it ? because i remember it like it was just yesterday .
take the cure with me .
that &apos;s how much i know this is real .
that &apos;s how certain i am that i &apos;m gonna love you
even after this is all over .
take the cure .
be human with me .
you know , i used to miss being human .
now i can &apos;t think of anything more miserable on earth .
you walked away from me
because you didn &apos;t want me to change your mind
because you don &apos;t want this .
that was a long time ago .
you haven &apos;t thought this through .
what ? ! no !
you &apos;re so afraid of losing me
that you &apos;ve convinced yourself that you can endure a human life .
don &apos;t tell me what to think .
ok . fine . what about stefan ? what does he think ?
i don &apos;t care what stefan thinks !
i &apos;ve made up my mind .
i &apos;m not gonna have him drown me in a fountain of guilt
and have me change my mind .
damon , i love you
more than i ever thought was humanly possible .
i &apos;m not trying to hurt you ,
but i can &apos;t let you do this ,
not before you &apos;ve let everyone in your life
try to talk you out of it , including you .
hello ?
look who &apos;s awake .
lorenzo , is that you ?
just wanted to make sure you &apos;re in good hands .
let me out so we can speak like civilized people .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i can take it from here .
she &apos;s fragile .
she should be around someone she trusts .
i said i can take it from here .
i &apos;ll come visit , lily .
this is a family matter now .
you know , earlier , you asked me
what it &apos;d feel like to have something i cherished
for 150 years ripped away from me .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;d be devastated .
a little late to win me over .
it &apos;s never too late .
that &apos;s the upside of eternity .
you &apos;ll be my mother for the next century
and the one after that and the one after that ,
and one day , maybe not soon ,
but one day ...
you &apos;ll see me as your son .
stefan ...
you have no idea what devastation feels like ...
but you will
because i am going to find a way
to get my people back ,
no matter what it takes .
come and get it .
big breakfast for a big day !
it &apos;s time we get the hell out of this place .
