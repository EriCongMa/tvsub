Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun.
The werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone.
He told me about your ex, Katherine.
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
Sacrifice is what breaks it. The blood of the doppelganger.
You're the doppelganger.
Don't! You need me. Elena's in danger.
Klaus is the real deal.
Who is he?
One of the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
Luka.
I'd like to introduce you to my dad.
Jonas Martin.
You're a witch?
We prefer the term "Warlock."
Elijah. One of the originals.
He's a legend.
You got in touch with Elijah. How'd you do it?
A guy named slater, in Richmond.
You can destroy the curse, but you need the moonstone.
He delivered his message.
It won't be long now.
Elena.
I heard something.
That was us.
I'm sorry.
We didn't think anyone was up...
But here you are... You're ...
We were just...
Chunky monkey?
I didn't... really hungry... at all.
I'm naked.
So I'm gonna go.
I'm really, really sorry.
It's ok, Jenna, don't worry about it.
I know he's been staying over a lot.
Are you-- are you sure it's ok?
Seems like things are good.
They're extremely good.
Then I'm extremely ok with it.
Let's do it.
1, 2, 3.
Can we talk?
Why?
We went to see Katherine.
Come on in.
Please...
Come on in.
There's plenty of room for all of us.
I'd rather poke my eyes out.
Mmm, they're such pretty eyes.
We're here for the moonstone.
Feel like tossing it over?
Tell you what. Hmm.
You get your little witch to hocus pocus me out of here,
You can have whatever you want.
I thought you liked it in here.
Nice and safe, where Klaus can't get to you.
I've had time to reconsider.
Meaning you're hungry.
I'm starving, Damon.
And dirty. But above all, I'm bored.
At least running from Klaus isn't boring.
So here's the deal--
You get me out of here, you get the moonstone
And I'll disappear from mystic falls forever.
Let me know what you decide.
You don't believe her, do you?
No, of course not. We just want the moonstone.
According to Rose's friend Slater,
there's a way to destroy the spell that Klaus wants to break.
No spell, no doppelganger sacrifice.
Ergo, you live.
How do you destroy it?
By releasing it from the moonstone.
How do you guys even know this is gonna work?
'cause we have a crafty witch on our side.
You discussed it with Bonnie.
She agreed to anything she could to help us.
It's Katherine who has the moonstone.
She's not going to give it to you.
We're gonna get it from her.
Well, what he means to say
is that we will pry it from her cold, dead hand
if we have to.
Bonnie just needs to find a way to release
the seal long enough for us to get in,
get the moonstone and get out in time
for her to return it.
Wow. I mean, it sounds
like you guys already have it all planned out.
Yep. We're awesome.
Except for one thing.
I don't want you to do it.
What are you talking about?
Elena, we don't have a choice.
What about Klaus?
We'll find him,
but after we get the moonstone.
Is that before or after he kills everyone that I care about,
including the two of you?
Elena, if we can de-spell the moonstone,
We can save your life.
I know. Everybody keeps saying that.
So your grams waited until you were in high school
to tell you that you're a witch?
Well, she brought it up before but I just thought
she was drunk.
In my defense, she was.
So then, you're, like, new?
New-ish.
I still have some growing pains.
Like?
Physically,
it's become a lot harder.
I have a bad reaction to it sometimes.
Your nose bleeds?
Yeah.
I pass out sometimes.
It's 'cause you're trying to do too much on your own.
You need help.
From what?
From nature.
The elements.
Just things that you can draw extra power from.
Have you ever channeled another witch before?
What is that?
Say we put our energy together.
We can double our strength.
I'll show you, watch.
Let me see that bracelet.
Take this.
Now I want you to stand very still
and concentrate.
I don't get it.
Ok. I know, it's, I--
What are we doing?
We're channeling.
The personal items will act as a talisman.
Now concentrate.
What is that?
Pretty cool, huh?
What's with that weather, huh?
It's global warming, man.
I don't know.
I gotta go.
See ya later, Bonnie.
Bye, Luka.
Bye.
That guy is weird, huh?
No, he's not.
What is it?
It's Damon.
It's not nice to leave a
girl naked so early in the morning.
Whoa.
Sorry, I thought you were...
I, uh, sorry, I...
There's no one else here.
Actually, I came to talk to you.
Then I should probably get dressed.
It's a bad idea.
No, it's not.
From what Stefan told me,
Your friend Slater
obviously has more information about Klaus.
And you and Damon just gave up before you got it.
Because somebody blew up a coffee shop with us in it.
There's more to learn.
We just have to find a way to learn it.
Why are you coming to me with this?
Because you owe me.
One word from me, and Damon and Stefan
could have killed you for kidnapping me.
Or maybe it's because you
know that they wouldn't want you doing this.
And their moonstone caper
gives you a chance to sneak away.
We're having a disagreement, okay?
They're willing to risk everyone that I love, and I'm not.
They're just trying to protect you.
And you've proven that you
can't care less whether I'm protected or not.
So we're back to you taking me to Slater.
What exactly do you have to achieve by this?
How would you like to be able to walk during the daylight?
I've been a slave to shadows for 500 years.
What do you think?
I think I know a witch who's willing to do
whatever it takes to help,
If you're willing to make a deal.
Hey, man. How you doing?
Good, you?
I'm pissed at myself for picking a fight with you.
And feeling guilty for what happened to Sarah.
I've been dodging you for days
'cause I didn't know what to say to you.
Don't worry about it, man.
I'm really sorry.
Please know that.
Matt.
Hey.
How are you?
I--I've been better.
I gotta--
I gotta get to class.
Ok.
Are you two still on the outs?
Looks like it.
You realize there's almost a full moon?
Vampires don't have enough problems, you want to take on mine?
Have you even thought about it?
The whole...wolf thing?
Do you know what you're going to do?
I'll be fine.
Well?
It's kind of private.
I'm student council vice president,
Head of the prom committee, not to mention
I single-handedly organized this town's clean up campaign.
You're really going to turn down my help?
I might be able to lower the tomb spell
long enough for you to get in there
and grab the moonstone from Katherine.
How? It took both you and your grams last time,
and look what happened to her.
I'm well aware of what happened.
But I've learned a few new things.
Bonnie...
How will you get it?
She hasn't been feeding.
She's weaker. We're not.
You wouldn't be underestimating her, would you?
It's a plan.
Is it perfect?
What plan is?
Let me do it. I've got my ring. I can get in,
get out, no spells necessary.
Thanks, you 16-year-old child.
Why didn't we think about that?
Why are you even here?
Maybe I can help better the plan.
Do you have anything that belongs to Katherine?
Slater!
Slater, it's Rose. Open up.
He's not home. Sorry.
No. We didn't come all the way out here for nothing.
After you.
Slater?
I don't think he's going to be much help.
It looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop
found him and killed him for his information.
Yeah, probably to stop him from helping people like us.
The guy was a vampire almanac. Knowing too much information
just bit him in the ass.
What are you
Tempered glass.
U.V. Rays can't penetrate.
I used to just come here and watch the day.
I'm sorry about Slater.
Any luck?
It's password protected, I can't get in.
No, this is fine. Let's just go.
Stay here.
Alice?
Rose!
He's dead!
This belonged to Katherine.
Found it with her things after I thought she was dead,
but it was hers.
What will this do?
I can turn the metal to ash.
Blow the ashes on her,
and it'll incapacitate her for a minute or two.
Long enough for you
to get the stone and get out.
Matt's bumming pretty hard.
I know.
It's better this way.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
You can't be honest with him.
And it's not really fair to be with someone
and not really let them know who you are.
I get it.
Head over here.
There's a cellar that goes to our old property.
I know.
You do?
I know that this is the old Lockwood property.
Watch your step.
I'm guessing this is where
Mason was headed the night he turned.
It's this way.
Did Mason tell you about this place?
Mason bolted before I triggered the curse,
but I found these.
They look old.
And these bolts and chains.
I need new chains, but the bolts could still hold.
I think that's what this place is used for.
For full moons.
What's this?
I have no idea.
It was Mason's.
"August 31st--
My body is changing.
I'm edgy, I'm angry, impatient.
I get so mad, I black out
and forget what I say or do.
I'm not myself,
not since Jimmy's death.
What's happening to me?"
He chronicled everything.
Full moon is tonight.
Well, does he say what happened?
Better get the torches.
Alaric's stake gun's in my trunk. Bonnie?
Go ahead.
I'm almost done.
What are you doing?
Hey, you're not strong enough.
I'll be fine.
You could get hurt.
And Elena could die.
I'll be fine.
Promise.
I promise.
Here, I got this, OK?
Go get me, um, go get me something
to put this in.
All right?
She found him a few minutes before we did.
How is she?
Overreacting. Big time.
Her boyfriend just died.
There's no such thing as overreacting.
Those tears are for her.
She didn't care about Slater.
She was only dating him
long enough to see if he'd turn her.
Thank you.
You look really familiar.
Did you know Slater?
Not personally, no.
I just knew that he kept
detailed records of all of his vampire contacts,
and I was hoping that he could point me towards Klaus.
Doubtful.
Klaus doesn't want to be pointed out.
Do you know Slater's computer password?
Are you seriously asking me that right now?
I just saw my boyfriend
with a stake through his heart.
I understand that.
Do you know his password?
Who do you think you are?
What if I could convince Rose to turn you?
Will you show us his files then?
Someone's been here.
The hard drive's completely wiped out.
Yeah, probably whoever killed him.
Lucky for you, Slater was paranoid.
Everything's backed up on our remote server.
You know that she's not going
anywhere near my blood, right?
I know. She doesn't.
Kristin Stewart.
God, was he obvious.
These are all links to vampires?
Slater was obsessed, almost as much as me.
What about that one? Cody Webber.
We exchanged dozens of emails about Elijah.
I could call him.
Tell him that we're trying
to send a message to Klaus.
The doppelganger is alive,
and she's ready to surrender.
What?!
Oh, my God, I knew I recognized you.
Get him the message, please.
What are you doing?
I'm getting Klaus' attention.
If Klaus knows that you're alive,
he'll find you and he'll kill you.
Which is exactly what you wanted all along.
It's either me or my family.
So this whole charade was a suicide mission
so that you could sacrifice yourself
and save everyone else?
Cody is on his way.
And he really wants to meet you.
The youngest Gilbert.
This is an intriguing surprise.
I'm here for the moonstone.
Yeah, yeah, the moonstone.
It's very popular today.
Just give it to me.
Leave, little Gilbert.
If you want it, you're going to have to come here and get it.
I kinda figured you'd say that.
Where is it?
Sorry I'm late. I had to grab
the grimoire from home.
Jeremy couldn't take the pressure, huh?
He said he'd be here.
Not a good time, Rose.
Don't be angry with me.
Why, what'd you do?
You need to get to Richmond immediately.
Tell me.
Is that the moonstone?!
I hate to interrupt,
but today has just been full of surprises.
I'm sorry.
I took some powder.
Don't worry.
I know that he's wearing his ring,
So no matter how many times I kill him,
he'll just keep coming back for more.
So, I'm going to be in the back
playing with my new little toy.
You guys just give me a holler when you've got the tomb open.
So how exactly does this spell work?
Give me your hand.
Place it here.
Now, take my hand.
Close your eyes.
Relax your mind.
And look for her.
You saw her, didn't you?
I know exactly where she is.
Where the hell is Damon?
We can't wait, we have to get him out of there.
If she's fed, she has her strength back.
We still have what's left of the ash.
Do you think you can get close enough?
I don't have a choice.
It's going to take me some time.
How long?
I don't know, a while.
Just get me in there as soon as you can.
So how was school?
Riveting.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
September 15th--
2 hours from the first full moon
since I triggered the curse.
He taped his first transformation.
September 16th, he--
He wrote about everything the next day.
"I chose the garage.
I could deadbolt the door.
It was far from the street so no one could hear.
I bolted hooks to the floor for the carabineers."
Like for mountain climbing?
Retractable cables.
What's he doing?
It's...Wolfsbane.
"I diluted wolfsbane with water to weaken myself,
but I could barely get it down without puking.
It felt like I was drinking battery acid."
Hours passed and nothing happened.
It got so quiet, I could hear my own blood pumping.
That's when...
I kept thinking I'd black out and not feel it.
But I did. I...
I felt all of it.
Help! Has somebody...
How long is it?
We're 3 hours in.
4 hours.
5 hours.
How long does this last?
I can't-- I can't do that.
Caroline, whatever that was,
I can't go through that.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You called him?
I'm sorry, Elena.
You said that you understood.
She lied.
Damon Salvatore.
Get rid of her.
No...way.
Come on. We're leaving.
No.
I said we're leaving.
I'm not going with you.
You do not get to make decisions anymore.
When have I ever made a decision?
You and Stefan do that for me.
Now this, this is my decision.
Who's going to save your life while
you're making decisions?
You're not listening to me, Damon.
I don't want to be saved.
Not if it means
that Klaus is going to kill every single person that I love.
Get your ass out the door before I throw you over my shoulder
and carry you out myself.
No.
Don't ever do that again.
Something's happening.
Bonnie, no!
You have to stop her, she's not strong enough!
Maybe she is.
What's going on?
It's Bonnie Bennett.
She's channeling me.
Why would you let her do that?
You told me to bond with her, so I bonded.
My God.
Bonnie, Bonnie.
Bonnie... You gotta stop her!
Ok, you need to stop. Bonnie!
Luka!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie, wake up, please.
Bonnie, wake up.
Yes, please.
Because I'm still in here.
Are you OK? Here.
Are you all right?
It didn't work.
I'm not strong enough.
Even with help, I can't do it.
Ohh, that's too bad. I'm still hungry.
Go!
You know what,
I don't think we should read this anymore.
Why, what did you read?
There's a...
a reason it's called a "curse," Tyler.
"Unimaginable pain."
"I thought it would never end."
"It was the worst night of my life."
But...
he did say that the transformation
speeds up over time.
So if you can just get through
this first time, then--
Why are you helping me?
What do you mean?
Why do you care?
We've never been friends before.
That's not true. I've known you my entire life, Tyler.
We've never been close.
Not like this.
I don't know.
You just seem like you...
like you kinda need it.
I was alone when I turned.
I had no control over my body
or...my urges.
And...
I killed somebody.
I don't want that to happen to you.
I don't want you to be alone.
I gotta...
Matt...
I know I should have called. I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
But I was driving home from work,
and I just--I kinda found myself here.
Well, are you OK?
I--I've been worried about you.
I miss you.
Yeah.
Matt, I...
Hey.
Hey.
Time to go.
Alice is soundly sleeping,
and won't remember a moment
of this horribly stupid day.
We're here to meet the doppelganger.
Thank you for coming.
I will break your arm.
There's nothing here for you.
I killed you. You were dead.
For centuries now.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm Elijah.
We were going to bring her to you.
For Klaus. She's the doppelganger.
I don't know how she exists, but she does.
Klaus would want to see her.
Does anyone else know that you're here?
No.
Well, then, you have been incredibly helpful.
Where's Luka?
Asleep.
His shadow spell was successful.
I was able to track that girl.
However, I did have a little run in
with one of the brothers that killed me.
I assume he didn't live to tell about it.
Actually, I spared him.
He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.
They both would.
She'll be kept safe.
For now.
Well, that's precisely what we need her to be.
Safe.
I'm home, ok?
I don't need an escort to my room.
Oh, I don't know.
Between here and upstairs,
there's still time for you to do something stupid.
I already feel bad. I don't need you to berate me.
Stefan is stuck in there,
and I don't know how to get him out.
What should I be doing?
You should admit that you never should have
tried this in the first place.
I didn't have a choice, Jeremy!
Yeah, well, neither did I.
Why did you have to get involved?
'cause I didn't want you to get hurt.
Look, Jeremy,
you can't feel that way about me.
Don't.
What?
Don't act like this is one-sided. Like...
Like I'm some kid
that has a crush on his sister's friend.
You could have died today.
And you almost did.
That was a chance I was willing to take.
I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
thank you for bringing me home.
Well, your ride left you.
Didn't want to leave you stranded.
She was just scared. She didn't mean to run.
Yes, she did.
She's been running for 500 years.
I can't believe Elijah's alive.
Why do you think he killed those 2 vampires and just let us go?
If I had a dollar for every time
some evil vampire surprised me.
What you did today was incredibly stupid.
Actually, the only thing was stupid was that I got caught.
I don't question why you and Stefan, everyone else
tries so hard to save me.
You shouldn't question why I would try to save all of you.
Damon, good night, ok?
What?
It's Stefan.
Stefan.
Stefan!
Don't you dare.
Stefan's in there, damon!
How could you let this happen?
What are you talking about? I was too busy saving you
from your crazy kamikaze mission.
You didn't even have to go after the moonstone in the first place.
It was the right call.
The right call? How is any of this the right call?
Damon, let go of me.
Damon, let go of me!
Let go of me!
Let go of me.
Please.
Are you done?
Off all the idiot plans, Stefan.
I'll find a way to get you out.
No, that's all right.
I'll--I'll handle it myself.
Bonnie has the moonstone.
Work with her, try to figure out how to de-spell it.
You martyr yourself into a tomb
and I get partnered with a semi-competent witch.
Wonderful.
Keep Elena away from here.
Yeah.
'cause that'll be easy.
Promise me.
No matter what happens.
You'll protect her.
Promise.
That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
