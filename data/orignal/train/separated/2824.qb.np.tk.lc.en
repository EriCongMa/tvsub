we are so in luck !
treeger said we could have all this cool stuff !
wait right there .
oh , no . i &apos;m paddling away .
really ? we got all this rusty crap for free ?
this and a bunch of bubble wrap . and some of it is not even popped .
could we be more white trash ?
the one with the cuffs
how desperate am l ?
good thing chandler &apos;s not here . he always wins at this game .
i just told my mom i &apos;d cater her party .
how come ?
i need the money .
it &apos;d be a great way to get rid of that last smidgen of self @-@ respect .
i think this is a good thing .
mom wouldn &apos;t have hired you if you weren &apos;t good .
you don &apos;t have to stick up for her . she can &apos;t hear you .
do you have any juice ?
just pickle .
funny story . i bumped into joanna yesterday .
my boss , joanna ? that must have been awkward .
actually , she asked me if i wanted a drink .
you didn &apos;t say yes to that , did you ?
no , no
hello , rachel .
well , not at first .
what is she doing here ?
last time you went out with her you said she was a dud !
i judged her too quickly . this time , we took it to the next level .
last time i almost got fired . you must end it . you must end it now .
it &apos;s not an everyday occurrence !
usually i &apos;m in there by myself .
promise .
rachel , aren &apos;t you running late ?
no
you are if you pick me up a bagel .
okay .
promise you will end this now .
i promise . i &apos;ll end it .
thank you .
i hope you know what i &apos;m giving up .
she &apos;s not just the boss in your office . you know what i mean ?
sorry . i knew what he meant .
how &apos;s the hired help ?
doing great . quiches are coming along .
what &apos;s this ? blue nail polish ?
i thought it was cute .
it &apos;s what your grandmother &apos;s hands looked like when we found her .
let me ask you a question .
why did you hire me ?
richard raved about the food at his party ...
... but you were sleeping with him .
then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was nice .
i assume you didn &apos;t sleep with anyone there .
at least that would be something .
oh , my god ! did you hear that ?
she hired me because she thinks i &apos;m good .
i didn &apos;t hear that .
she didn &apos;t hire me out of pity .
it wasn &apos;t so she could pick on me . she actually thinks i &apos;m good .
and hey , it &apos;s cool if you &apos;re a lesbian .
good afternoon . are you the decision @-@ maker of the house ?
do you currently own a set of encyclopedias ?
no , but try the classifieds . people sell everything in there .
actually , i &apos;m not buying . i &apos;m selling .
let me ask you one question .
do your friends ever have a conversation ...
... and you just nod along , not sure what they &apos;re talking about ?
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s totally unconstitutional .
i think he deserves a nobel prize .
no
it was like the algonquin kids &apos; table .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
you haven &apos;t said anything for about two minutes .
are you at all interested ?
come on in .
that &apos;s weird .
what ?
your nails .
i wore fake ones so my mom wouldn &apos;t give me grief about biting them .
i meant , it &apos;s weird that you only have nine now .
oh , my god !
wait a minute .
i had them when i put
oh , my god ! it &apos;s in the quiche !
oh , my god !
okay , don &apos;t panic .
i &apos;ll go buy you a new set of nails .
no one will know , and you &apos;ll look great !
it &apos;s because they &apos;re going to eat that &apos;s the problem .
honey , don &apos;t bite your nails .
please don &apos;t freak out .
there &apos;s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups .
and there &apos;s no way to know which one .
and whoever finds it wins the prize !
i &apos;m not freaking out .
why are you laughing ?
now your father owes me $ 5 .
you bet i &apos;d lose a nail ?
don &apos;t be silly . i just bet that i &apos;d need these .
frozen lasagnas ?
you bet that i &apos;d screw up ?
all that stuff about how i was good
no , that was all true .
this was just in case you &quot; pulled a monica . &quot;
you promised dr. weinberg you &apos;d never use that phrase .
come on . have a sense of humor .
you &apos;re never able to laugh at yourself .
that &apos;s right .
my mom has no faith in me ! that &apos;s hilarious !
i don &apos;t get it .
no . i have faith .
no . you have lasagnas !
the ruined quiches are ready !
i really don &apos;t think we should be doing this .
okay .
it just doesn &apos;t feel like we &apos;re breaking up .
no , we are . i &apos;m sad .
okey
can you wait till tomorrow ? all right .
unbelievable !
thanks .
that was my boss . i have to go .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting dressed .
why ?
when i walk outside naked , people throw garbage .
wait . i want to show you something .
what is it ?
just a little gag gift somebody gave me .
put your hands together .
you &apos;re not the boss of me .
yeah , you are .
saucy !
i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .
you &apos;re going to leave me like this ?
knowing you &apos;re here waiting for me . i think it &apos;s exciting , don &apos;t you ?
if you don &apos;t come back soon ...
... there &apos;s pretty much nothing i can do about it !
i brought you back a macaroon .
great . i &apos;ll keep it in my butt with your nose .
that &apos;s weird . she locked the door .
you know why ? she &apos;s got the bonus list in there .
i saw her working on it today .
swear you won &apos;t tell .
when mark left , he gave me a key to her office .
you want to see the list ?
how are you ?
hello , joanna ...
office .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll be a little longer .
how little ?
a couple hours .
this isn &apos;t funny . get back here now !
i can &apos;t !
why not ?
i &apos;m in my boss &apos; car .
what ?
tunnel !
what ?
rachel , could i see you for a moment ?
okay , here &apos;s the situation .
the keys to the cuffs are on the door .
could you be a doll ...
... and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me ?
and on a totally separate subject , that &apos;s a lovely pantsuit .
you promised you would break up with her .
i did break up with her ! she just took it really , really well !
jeopardizing my career never entered your mind ?
it did enter my mind .
but then something happened that made it shoot right out .
you got yourself into those cuffs , you get yourself out .
i can &apos;t get myself right out of them .
you must have me confused with the &quot; amazing chandler &quot; !
unlock me ! she could be gone for hours , and i &apos;m cold and ....
all right ! this is it !
never see her again .
never !
never come in here again .
fine !
give me back my walkman !
i never borrowed it .
then i lost it . buy me one !
you got it ! here we go ! come on . this is great !
does it hurt ?
no , i always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off .
hello , sweet pants !
wait ! what will you tell joanna ?
about what ?
she &apos;ll see you &apos;re gone and know i let you out , and i &apos;ll get fired !
i &apos;ll tell a lie ! i &apos;m good at lying !
i actually did borrow your walkman !
she &apos;ll know i have a key to her office .
i &apos;ve got to lock you back up .
i don &apos;t think so .
this is much better .
here &apos;s somebody interesting .
what do you know about van gogh ?
he cut off his ear .
and ?
i &apos;m out .
he painted that .
that &apos;s pretty nice .
i thought he cut off his ear because he sucked .
what else you got in there ?
let &apos;s see ....
where does the pope live ?
ln the woods .
wait , that &apos;s the joke answer .
actually , it &apos;s vatican city .
now , what do you know about vulcanized rubber ?
spock &apos;s birth control .
you need these books .
this used to be your room ?
you must have been in really good shape as a kid .
i &apos;m such an idiot !
i can &apos;t believe i thought she could change .
who cares what your mom thinks ?
so you &quot; pulled a monica . &quot;
i &apos;m glad that &apos;s catching on .
why does that have to be a bad thing ? just change what it means .
prove your mother wrong .
you finish the job , and we &apos;ll call that &quot; pulling a monica . &quot;
what ?
if a kid gets straight a &apos;s , his parents say , &quot; you pulled a monica . &quot;
a fireman saves a baby , and they go , &quot; he pulled a monica . &quot;
someone hits a homer , and they say , &quot; that one &apos;s out of here . &quot;
because some things don &apos;t change .
all right . i &apos;ll go down there .
i won &apos;t serve the lasagna . i &apos;ll serve what i make .
my breasts are really strong .
i have to get you locked back up . i &apos;m so going to lose my job !
she &apos;s very private about her office !
now i know why !
you &apos;re in trouble either way .
if she sees me locked to this ...
... she &apos;ll know you were here . you might as well let me go .
i &apos;ll clean your bathroom for a month .
still won &apos;t be clean .
all i want is my freedom .
foot rubs for a month !
freedom !
i &apos;ll put all your photos into albums !
i want my freedom !
why won &apos;t you hear me ! sophie , help me !
sophie , sit !
freedom ...
would you just calm down ? !
i &apos;m going to say this for the last time .
would you please just
there &apos;s a lot i didn &apos;t know about vomit .
in a minute .
so what do you say ?
you get the whole set of encyclopedias for $ 1200 .
that works out to just 50 bucks a book .
1200 dollas ?
you think i have $ 1200 ?
i &apos;m home during the day ...
... and i got patio furniture in my living room .
there &apos;s a few things you don &apos;t get from book learning .
well , what can you swing ?
how about zero down and zero a month for a long , long time ?

there will be rumors about this . no way to stop it .
sophie , monica and phoebe know .

i called them .
when they ask me what i saw ...
... i can be very generous ...

i can make you a legend .
i can make you this generation &apos;s milton berle .
and milton berle has
not compared to you .
they &apos;re not even touching the lasagna .
they love your casserole !
yes !
it &apos;s hard to believe a while ago this was just ingredients .
everyone seems to like your dish .
and you ?
i thought it was ...
... quite tasty .
so if everyone liked it , and you liked it ...
... that would make this a success . which would make you ....
a bitch ?
i meant &quot; wrong , &quot; but we can use your word .
yes , well , i was wrong .
and i have to say ...
... you really impressed me today .
you might even say that she &quot; pulled a monica . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t know we switched it .
and the next time you cater for me ...
... there will be nothing but ice in the freezer .
that really means a lot .
mom , don &apos;t bite your nails !
hello , chandler .
i love you .
what &apos;s going on ?
no , he doesn &apos;t !
two hours , that lasted .
so did you break up with joanna ?
i think so .
it &apos;s good you got out , before she blew up like vesuvius .
the volcano ?
speaking of volcanoes , man , are they a violent igneous rock formation !
what ? -lava spewing , hot ash .
of course , some are dormant .
why are you talking about volcanoes all of a sudden ?
we don &apos;t have to .
what do you want to talk about ? vivisection ?
the vas deferens ?
the vietnam war ?
