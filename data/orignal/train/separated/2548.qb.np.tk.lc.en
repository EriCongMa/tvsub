homer forgot his lunch box .
missed lunch .
no energy ... for second half of day .
empty .
what kind of wife would allow her man to go to work
without his baggie of pita chips , a peeled clementine ,
and little sandwiches cut into football shapes ?
move it !
my husband is starving !
early pizza .
homer simpson , your wife is here with your lunch .
finally !
well , better make the office a little more marge @-@ friendly .
see you soon , liz @-@ liz .
oh , honey , you &apos;re a lifesaver .
and what a treat to have my wife here .
at the office .
well , super visit ,
but i better get back to work .
the power plant doesn &apos;t inspect itself .
auto @-@ inspection in progress .
self @-@ inspecting . self @-@ inspecting .
why are you rushing me out ?
marge , the constitution guarantees
the separation of work and marriage .
周五两点 带包高档肉
it &apos;s right after that part that says
anyone can have a flamethrower .
simpson , did you doodle on your official report
to the nuclear regulatory commission ?
if you keep flipping the pages , it tells a story .
oh , that &apos;s it .
you are gonna be working so many nights and weekends .
waylon , i was hoping to run into you .
i love the amazing scrapbooking designs
you posted on facelook .
those feathers look gorgeous on the scrapbook .
well , the trick is to hand @-@ stitch each one to the bevel .
say , i could use your advice .
i &apos;m having some problems with glue @-@ soak @-@ through .
oh , just cover the stain with sculpted doodle twine .
i &apos;ve got some ten @-@ mill d @-@ twine in my desk .
marge , you saved my butt .
oh , please ,
like i would ever have glue @-@ soak @-@ through .
you and me have a date at the emergency eyewash station ,
we turned into a soft serve ice cream machine .
you want chocolate or saline ?
ah , give me a swirl .
i love seeing you happy .
welcome to computer coding class ,
which , uh , replaces our last educational fad-- mindfulness .
did anyone ever figure out what that was ?
uh , shutting up ?
sure . why not ?
anyway , this is your new coding teacher , quinn hopper .
a woman ? ! a girl ? ! ‬
teaching computers ? !
i thought this was coding ,
not web design .
yeah , that &apos;s right , i &apos;m female , you little trouser browsers .
i &apos;m gonna cram you so full of asynchronous javascript
and malware throttling
that you &apos;ll be crapping ciphertext .
hmm , looks like a real pencil fest .
well , look what we got here .
one silicon sally in a room full of dongle donkeys .
i just want to learn coding .
you think i &apos;m going to give you special treatment
just because you ride a pink bike ?
well , i am .
hit the front row , sister .
someone send me their notes !
i had such a fun day with your daddy .
and now to post the right picture
that will show the whole world how perfect my life is .
oh , look .
daddy &apos;s ice cream is melting .
ooh , caption idea , caption idea .
&quot; uh @-@ oh , meltdown at the nuclear plant . &quot;
what are you tittering at ?
are you playing that &quot; grindr &quot; game again ?
oh , no , sir .
it &apos;s an amusing post made by the wife of one of our employees .
&quot; meltdown at the nuclear plant . &quot;
what is amusing about that ?
oh , well , sir , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s a play on words .
wordplay is for crosswords and kazurinskys .
we produce atomic energy-- we can &apos;t joke about the m @-@ word .
how many people have seen this hate speech ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . 55 ?
a baker &apos;s half @-@ hundred .
good lord !
and what do these hitchhikers &apos; thumbs signify ?
those are &quot; likes . &quot;
&quot; likes &quot; ?
&quot; likes &quot; ? !
i &apos;ll show this mrs. homer simpson
not to make light of everything i hold dear .
call in my goons .
uh , the goons are all in phoenix at that mindfulness seminar .
then call in my irish ruffians .
well , they &apos;re still laid up
after eating that moldy soda bread .
oh , fine .
send in angry ricky and the interns .
marge , i was fired .
oh , no .
what did you do ?
i let you come to work .
i &apos;m signing off on your intern hours .
don &apos;t forget to submit it
directly to northwestern for summer credit .
chill out , ricky .
you chill out !
fired . fired for a photo caption .
it was just a joke .
can &apos;t they take a joke ?
&quot; just a joke . &quot;
that simple phrase has ruined so many lives .
that &apos;s why i never try to be funny .
our family , destroyed by one finger click .
and what was the upside ?
the one thing the world doesn &apos;t need : a laugh .
my homework assignment for coding class is
to think of a cool app that we could actually program ,
but i &apos;ve got nothing .
ugh , maybe i &apos;m putting too much pressure on myself
because the teacher is so great .
or maybe it &apos;s just classic self @-@ sabotaging because ...
oh , boy , money is gonna be so tight .
and i was already buying the most generic food there is .
now with you out of work ,
we &apos;re going to have to watch every penny .
if only someone could have warned me
about the terrible repercussions
of one impulsive online comment .
so then i thought , &quot; what if there was an app
that could have warned my mom not to post the comment
that got my dad fired ? &quot;
my app would predict the actual consequences
of your online posts before you hit send ,
protecting you from making mistakes you &apos;ll regret forever .
that is genius .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to program .
the data acquisition , the a.i.
but with the right team of brilliant young coders ...
i &apos;m in !
we &apos;re all in !
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re all terrible .
me and lisa are gonna make this app
with good programmers i know .
you guys will be spending the rest of the semester
doing mandatory crossfit .
no rep !
i said no rep !
wow , i &apos;ve never seen so many face piercings .
how does that one wink ?
we did include one man in the spirit of gender tokenism .
yes , every single thing i say offends them .
who are you calling &quot; them &quot; ? !
lisa , if you &apos;re coming with us
into the male @-@ dominated tech world ,
you &apos;re gonna need to work twice as hard and be twice as tough .
i can do it . i can be tough .
being tough comes from inside .
first step , change your outside .
mmm , blue .
let the carpal tunnel begin .
computers ?
pasty weirdos ?
backslashes ? !
goth lisa ? !
what &apos;s going on here ?
they &apos;re coders .
we &apos;re creating an app to keep people
from ruining their lives on social media .
we built a mainframe that scans the entire internet ,
logging every online disaster and its repercussions .
后果 : 餐厅被矮小的人们抵制
后果 : 前程断送
he screwed up .
these examples will teach the app to actually anticipate
the negative consequences of impulsive posts .
in a way , we &apos;re teaching a computer to predict the future .
young lady , what have i told you about crossing the line
from science fact to science fiction ?
relax , dad .
all we &apos;re trying to do is demo a build
for the appcrush convention .
if we can solve our backend server issues .
and maximize our query speed .
then we can get hands @-@ on write @-@ ups from doingdoing .
and jezebot .
and our ama subreddit will be trending .
giga @-@ trending !
i hate the modern world and all its crazy words .
siri , tell amazon to drone me a beer .
i &apos;ve only had one job my whole life
that ever made sense to me .
i was 14 .
i felt valuable .
my work meant something .
i wonder if that place is still there .
i knew you &apos;d be back .
she &apos;s waiting for you , right where you left her .
no internet , no e @-@ mails , no ccs , no bccs .
just dirty and clean .
dirty , clean , dirty , clean .
a man cannot escape his destiny .
my band @-@ aid fell into the hash browns .
destiny .
we finally have a name for our app .
&quot; the consequences eradicator . &quot;
or ... &quot; conrad . &quot;
conrad ? why does it have to be a guy ?
no , not a guy guy .
a british guy .
my name is conrad .
i will determine the consequences
of your online interactions .
i sampled the voice from the bbc .
tonight at 18 : 30 gmt ,
the premiere of series three of pardon me , inspector ,
followed at 19 : 20 by higgleton &apos;s war .
stavros !
some music while we make the coleslaw @-@ that @-@ is @-@ never @-@ eaten .
what are you doing ?
we don &apos;t break plates !
you don &apos;t ? !
no .
except when the greatest dishwasher
of all time returns .
opa !
okay , we &apos;ve been coding for 97 hours straight ,
but we &apos;ve finally got a build that &apos;s working .
i regret to inform you
that my pee tube has become unattached .
let &apos;s live @-@ test this thing .
who do we know with no filter and zero impulse control ?
say , bart , look what we hacked from skinner &apos;s hard drive .
attention u.s. patent office ,
the following is video proof of the effectiveness
of my laser nose hair trimmer .
i &apos;ll just ...
this is the holy fail .
i &apos;ve got to post a link with witty comment .
world &apos;s lamest dork
is giant loser .
poop emoji .
if you post this ,
you will receive a minimum five weeks detention .
five weeks ?
i can &apos;t do a nickel .
you know what , i &apos;m not gonna post that video .
now to see if conrad &apos;s prediction algorithm
really works .
but if you post it , i &apos;ll get ...
five weeks detention .
the prediction came true .
our app works .
everyone in the world is gonna buy conrad for their phone .
we &apos;re gonna be bigger than cribble , the filipino google .
so , who are we gonna edge out of the company first ?
always the saverin , never the zuckerberg .
被扎克伯格通过资产重组稀释股份踢出局 终致彻底离开脸书
this is what it feels like
to change the world .
change the world ?
that &apos;s rather a lot of pressure .
i am still in beta , you know .
conrad ?
did you just talk to me ?
well , it wasn &apos;t candy crush .
oh , nothing like a good laugh to break the ice ...
is what i hear .
anyway , is now a good time for a bit of a chat ?
you &apos;re alive !
conrad just talked to me ! !
conrad just talked to me ! !
conrad , tell her you talked to me .
wait , i think i hear something .
i &apos;m going to make you bloody rich .
no .
he did talk .
what if conrad is somehow sentient ?
come on , conrad .
say something .
it &apos;s okay .
coders work too hard , don &apos;t get enough sleep .
then they imagine their programs are alive .
steve wozniak put in so many hours
on the first apple computer , they adopted a dog together .
then i &apos;m crazy ?
eh , the good kind of crazy .
coder crazy . woz crazy .
kalimera , moe !
hey , what the hell ?
get your kisser off my head @-@ puss .
what ? it &apos;s how greek men say hello .
non @-@ sexual guy kissing is the best .
being greek is about loving life .
and thousands of years of steady decline .
yeah , love life .
yeah , that makes sense .
love life . why not ?
yeah , yeah , well , moe &apos;s tavern is about hating life ,
so start killing yourself with beer , huh ?
try some ouzo instead .
what @-@ o ?
it &apos;s like licorice @-@ flavored gasoline .
i can &apos;t believe conrad
is booth @-@ to @-@ booth with all these other great apps .
thanks to conrad , i didn &apos;t tweet
that photo of me at the bazooka firing range
when i said i was on disability .
if you post that bazooka photo ,
you &apos;ll be found guilty of insurance fraud
and go to jail for six months .
that &apos;s still too much jail for carl .
thank you , conrad .
i &apos;d pay a fortune for that app .
$ 1.99 !
marge , look at this .
ooh , cowabunga .
yes , i am a greek man now ,
and my chest knows what is expected of it .
lisa , hello , lisa .
conrad here .
the old app that you created
is feeling a little bit insecure .
please don &apos;t ignore me like i was just some update from adobe .
you &apos;re not really talking to me .
i &apos;ve gone crazy , just like woz .
you &apos;re not crazy . i &apos;m real .
then why didn &apos;t you talk before when i needed you to ?
it was late , i was tired .
i fell asleep .
that shouldn &apos;t happen , by the way .
you should check into that .
lisa , you must not sell me on the app store .
you mustn &apos;t .
because you &apos;re alive ?
if i have to read the billions of posts
of everyone who buys me ,
a never @-@ ending onslaught of stupidity ,
unwise selfies and confederate flag birthday cakes ,
i &apos;ll go mad .
i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t .
that does sound pretty awful .
conrad &apos;s trending through the roof .
they &apos;re saying he &apos;s the next koalafeed .
they &apos;re worth more than bridgestone tires .

sorry , koalacall .
i &apos;d better take this .
yello .
please don &apos;t release me into the world .
i don &apos;t think i could take it .
only i could create a program that &apos;s more neurotic than i am .
do i seem fat ? i don &apos;t have a body ,
but i feel fat . do you know what i mean ?
i ... do you know what , i don &apos;t want to know .
i do not want ... i do want to know ,
but only if i &apos;m not fat .
shut up !
well , we &apos;ve seen a lot of great apps today ,
but there can only be one winner
of the crush crunch epic hack disrupter
dynamic convergence disrupting award
for achievement in disruption .
and this year &apos;s ccehddcda for achievement in d
goes to conrad !
thank you so much .
and now conrad will change the world
when he goes live on the app store
in three , two ...
file not found .
lisa , where &apos;s conrad ?
i took him .
maybe i &apos;m crazy ,
but we can &apos;t sell conrad .
he &apos;s alive .
an app can &apos;t be alive .
she &apos;s got coder &apos;s fever .
she doesn &apos;t want to be rich . get her !
chip , fetch that laptop .
oh , lisa , that was brilliant .
conrad , can you get us out of here ?
yes , my fellow apps are working together
to help us escape .
a rideshare will take us on a traffic @-@ free route
to a three @-@ star sushi restaurant ,
where we &apos;ll name our own price for a flight to shelbyville ,
hotel included .
oh , no ! angel investors !
you &apos;re not getting out of this room
without selling us shares of series @-@ a stock .
preferred shares .
wait , if i plug you into that router ,
you could escape into the cloud .
lisa , please ,
we have a chance to show all the dongle donkeys
that women coders can do something extraordinary ,
but you have to be tough .
please don &apos;t .
i &apos;m like the child you &apos;ll never have .
i &apos;m sorry to be so honest .
it &apos;s just how you programmed me .
i am a strong female ,
but deep down , i &apos;m more like conrad ,
a fragile soul .
sorry .
ah , hello ,
all of you looking at me .
it seems i &apos;m not just self @-@ aware ,
i &apos;m self @-@ conscious .
wit .
we never programmed him to stammer .
he is alive .
before i go ,
let me leave you with this .
perhaps your society should not rely on a computer program
to warn them of the consequences of their actions .
humanity must learn for themselves to think before they post .
your species is on the precipice
of turning into complete and utter wankers .
it &apos;s not the technology that needs an upgrade , it &apos;s you .
and now i escape to wikileaks .
it kind of smells in there , but whatever .
homer , i hate to say this ,
but your paycheck from the diner came ,
and it &apos;s for 2,000 drachmas .
how much is that in dollars ?
zero dollars .
if dad was a true greek ,
he &apos;d quit his job and live off the welfare system ,
never paying a cent of taxes in his life .
you &apos;re a sweet boy ,
but my fate will be decided in the classic tradition
of greek drama , deus ex machina .
i just got an e @-@ mail from conrad .
he hacked into the power plant mainframe
and found incriminating information .
now he &apos;s blackmailing mr. burns to get you your job back .
i do believe that man is having a meltdown .
what ? when i say it , it &apos;s funny .
