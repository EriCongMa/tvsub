&quot; do you know ? &quot;
do you know who you are ?
do you know what &apos;s happened to you ?
do you want to live this way ?
there &apos;s a hole in the pericardium .
that &apos;s the source of all this blood ?
no , that &apos;s what &apos;s keeping him alive .
well , hello .
all it takes is one person , one patient , one moment ,
to change your life forever .
ross , i would like to introduce you to ...
the black mamba .
it can change your perspective ,
color your thinking ...
um ... isn &apos;t that the ivc ?
the single trickiest vessel in the entire human body ...
delicate , unpredictable .
hear that ?
the gurgling ?
that &apos;s its song .
see that ?
look how it twitches .
one wrong move , one misstep ,
and this patient is dead .
you can &apos;t repair that mamba without moving ...
with the mamba .
some people say it &apos;s impossible to repair .
one moment that forces you to re @-@ evaluate
everything you think you know .
come on , mamba .
let &apos;s dance .
you paged ?
mvc victim .
wanted you to take a look at the c @-@ spine x @-@ rays .
oh , damn .
poor guy .
oh . hey . i just nailed the mamba .
do you know who you are ?
the patient &apos;s c3 and 4 are obliterated .
his spinal cord is severed .
there &apos;s no way i can repair that .
do you know what &apos;s happened to you ?
but we just fixed his heart .
against all odds . &apos; cause i &apos;m awesome .
yeah , well , even so ,
he &apos;s lost all motor function from the neck down .
the man &apos;s paralyzed .
do you want to live this way ?
wait . what ?
unfortunately , the impact of the crash
severed his spinal cord at c3,
which is quite high in the neck --
yeah , no , i &apos;m a nurse . i @-@ i know what c3 is .
so you &apos;re saying ...
he &apos;s paralyzed .
yes .
i am so sorry .
but his brain function is good ,
and i was able to fully repair his heart --
uh , is his diaphragm working ? can he breathe on his own ?
no , he &apos;s currently on a ventilator .
there are options from here , once he &apos;s had time to recover --
uh , surgery to fuse his spine so he can sit up .
we can , uh , insert a @-@ a permanent trach .
these are all options we can discuss --
will he ever breathe on his own again ?
no . he will not .
okay , um ...
i need you to wake him up -- right now .
you can do that , right ?
elise , your husband just underwent major surgery .
i know , and now i &apos;m asking you to wake him up .
and i need you to ask him
if he wants you to remove the vent .
well , the vent is breathing for him .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s what &apos;s keeping him alive .
i was gonna surprise him tonight .
as an early anniversary gift , i got us playoff tickets .
i mean , nosebleed seats , but we kind of love it up there .
it &apos;s like , pretzels and hot dogs for dinner .
i mean , it &apos;s fun .
the last thing i thought when i woke up this morning
was i &apos;d lose jason .
i understand ...
what i &apos;m asking .
believe me , i don &apos;t want to lose him .
but ...
i know him . i know everything about him .
i understand how he thinks . i get his humor .
i could predict what he &apos;s gonna order in a restaurant .
and i just -- i don &apos;t think he would want this .
i know it .
i think he would rather die
than live one more minute hooked up to a machine .
it &apos;s your husband &apos;s right to decline treatment ,
if that &apos;s what he wants .
uh , it &apos;ll -- it &apos;ll take some time
to fully wean him off the sedation ,
but i &apos;ll let you know when he starts to wake .
thank you .
i think she really means it .
and that bugs you ?
no . i mean , maybe . i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not like i want to get married tomorrow , but never ?
but you &apos;re with her .
i @-@ if you love her , who cares if she &apos;s not the marrying kind ?
i wasn &apos;t .
yeah , but then you did .
right , but some people don &apos;t .
so , what -- we just keep doing what we &apos;re doing
for the next 20 years , and that &apos;s it ?
but if you &apos;re together , what does it matter ?
didn &apos;t see you there .
you okay ?
yep .
jason ?
my name is dr. yang .
i know you must be very confused right now ,
but i need to ask you some questions , okay ?
there &apos;s a tube down your throat , so you can &apos;t speak ,
but you should be able to nod &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no . &quot;
think you can do that for me ?
that &apos;s great . okay . let &apos;s get started .
do you know who you are ?
do you know where you are ?
do you know what &apos;s happened to you ?
you were in a car accident .
your vehicle was hit from behind ,
and you flipped over into oncoming traffic .
you &apos;re in a hospital right now .
do you know who this is ?
your spine was crushed in the accident ,
and you are paralyzed from the neck down .
you &apos;re currently breathing with the help of a ventilator .
that &apos;s the tube in your mouth .
now , i understand it might be your wish
for me to remove the vent ?
i want to make sure you understand what this means .
the ventilator is breathing for you .
that means , once it &apos;s removed ,
you will not be able to breathe on your own .
now , if you can &apos;t breathe ...
you will die .
it might take a few hours -- probably less .
do you understand this ?
oh , god .
do you still want me to remove the vent ?
i love you .
and i want you to know , whatever you decide ...
... i &apos;ll support you .
i &apos;ll be by your side , no matter what .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to ask one more time .
jason ,
would you like me to remove the vent ?
do you know who you are ?
do you know what &apos;s happened to you ?
do you want to live this way ?
ohh ! god !
hey , you .
what are we doing ? what the hell are we doing ?
i &apos;m ... waiting for an elevator ?
i just spent my day
saving the life of a man who &apos;s now choosing to die ,
and all i keep thinking is ...
you and i are throwing so much away .
we should be together .
you &apos;re the love of my life , and it is stupid --
just stupid -- for us to keep pretending .
i love you .
i want to be with you -- for real , forever .
it &apos;s as simple as that .
that &apos;s it .
we &apos;ve christened every room in this house .
yeah .
and it &apos;s a pretty big house . mm @-@ hmm .
i thought i wasn &apos;t gonna make it through the guest room .
yeah , but you rallied at the end . mm @-@ hmm .
mm @-@ hmm , i did .
you know , the house feels big for just two of us .
don &apos;t you think ?
ah . he is gorgeous .
no .
okay . um ...
this one .
i agreed to a dog , not a horse .
that &apos;s a mid @-@ size dog .
no , that is huge . you know what a big dog makes ?
what ?
big poop .
that thing could crap my entire body weight in a day .
hmm . that is a beautiful image . thank you .
that one .
what ?
that &apos;s the one .
no . no . that is not even a dog .
that is a rodent , and it looks mean .
hey , uh , we want this thing in here .
can someone get it out ?
conduit , please .
fresh off the printer .
kid &apos;s tiny for 12 months .
he &apos;ll grow when his heart &apos;s sending
a little more blood around the system .
the first couple kids we put conduits in ,
you can already see the difference in only a year .
hey , so , i have an emergency surgery .
i &apos;m gonna be in the o.r. for the next nine hours .
okay .
mrs. rodriguez !
oh , no . this is gonna take me at least three hours .
well , mrs. rodriguez is not gonna make it .
is she a cardio patient ?
i could have somebody page you a consult .
mrs. rodriguez will last until i finish here , and then i &apos;ll go .
ross , you &apos;ll close for me ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
well , this is why i said we should keep the damn dog
in the kitchen when we &apos;re gone .
i am not locking the dog in the kitchen .
well , then you can clean up the puddle
on the rug when you get home .
i &apos;ll leave it for you !
you got a dog ?
yes .
thing &apos;s gonna be dead in a week .
wait . you named your dog mrs. rodriguez ?
when you meet him , you &apos;ll understand .
meet him soon -- before he dies .
what ? i &apos;m a physician !
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m gonna have trouble keeping an animal alive .
give 5 @-@ 0 prolene , please .
what ? you think i can &apos;t keep a dog alive ?
whatever . don &apos;t worry about it .
he &apos;s perfectly healthy .
alex , it &apos;s not funny .
i can &apos;t believe
you &apos;re gonna dress the dog in my son &apos;s sweater .
mrs. rodriguez gets cold .
he doesn &apos;t have the constitution for all this damp and rain .
he gets the shakes .
what ?
you like the dog !
he &apos;s an unusual dog .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m becoming someone who likes dogs .
he just happens to relate to people like i do .
it &apos;s true .
i mean , he doesn &apos;t want to talk about
his feelings or the future .
if i walk him and feed him on a regular schedule ,
he &apos;ll curl up next to me on the couch ,
and if i don &apos;t , he &apos;ll bite my ankles .
it &apos;s a set of behaviors that makes sense to me .
you like the dog .
the dog gets you .
you &apos;re alike .
that &apos;s how i talk about my children .
you have a baby . oh !
a dog baby .
mrs. rodriguez !
i &apos;m sorry . i know how painful it is .
i &apos;ve been through it myself ,
but it &apos;s been over two years since the injury ,
and at some point , you just have to say enough is enough .
what ? no . y @-@ you have no idea where --
hey , look , your hand needs more time , all right ?
just give your hand rest , throw yourself into the rehab .
i &apos;ve done the rehab ! it &apos;s been two years !
it &apos;s done , okay ? i &apos;m good enough to operate .
i mean , what is this ? is this about mr. willenstein ?
that was a routine -- - the decision has been made .
you can keep your administrative duties ,
but you are not cleared to operate .
you &apos;re not going back in the o.r.
any other business before we adjourn ?
actually , uh ... yes , there is .
you had to bring it up to the board !
yeah . it was time .
it absolutely was not time . we didn &apos;t make the decision yet .
well , clearly , i &apos;m wrong , &apos; cause we did .
i just wasn &apos;t part of it .
listen , it is the job of a lifetime .
running the entire military trauma division with teddy --
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s what &apos;s next for me , cristina .
i can feel it .
yeah -- in germany !
we have a house ! i have my trial !
we are good here , owen . we &apos;re happy .
we can &apos;t just leave everything .
just listen to me for one second --
no . no . you want to know what ?
you &apos;re not backing me into this .
come on . nobody backs you into anything .
believe me -- i &apos;ve tried .
so , you want me to dump my whole trial ,
just when i &apos;m starting to get somewh--
that is not what i &apos;m sayi-- please stop .
stop acting like you &apos;re some hit @-@ and @-@ run victim .
i can &apos;t have another conversation
where the idea that my career
or , in fact , any of my wishes might come first
is presented as some ... crime against humanity !
oh , what ?
so , now we &apos;re back where we started ?
i never give you anything ,
so the terms under which we &apos;re together
are that your dreams die ?
can you quiet the damn dog ?
you know what ? you quiet the damn dog . you wanted the dog .
not that dog ! he doesn &apos;t even like me .
he only likes you .
because you make stupid decisions ! and he knows it !
i &apos;m not moving to germany !
oh , so , that &apos;s it ? conversation &apos;s over ?
of course it is .
i don &apos;t know why i ever entertained the idea for one second
that we might ever do anything that i &apos;d want .
coming through !
dr. yang !
oh , whatever it is , it can wait .
my shift is over , and i am going home .
come on . patient 11 -- jasper o &apos;neil .
he &apos;s back for his annual checkup .
apparently , he &apos;s learning to play hockey .
you handle it . send him my best .
but if my conduit gets smashed
because they let their kid get body @-@ checked on the ice ,
i &apos;m killing them !
will do .
hey , who &apos;d have thunk it ?
you and me -- we &apos;re belly buddies .
no , we &apos;re not .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re almost there .
all you have to do is push .
no . no can do .
we are almost there .
he &apos;s gonna have to stay up in there .
i &apos;ve got a cozy womb . he &apos;ll be happier .
it &apos;ll be better for everyone .
oh , my god ! oh , god ! oh , god !
wait a second . you have to wait a second .
no , i can &apos;t !
you have to wait one second .
i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t .
oh , god . this is a mistake . it &apos;s a mistake !
i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t !
what ?
this is a mistake , mer !
everyone says that .
here we go . we need one more push .
okay , now !
push ! push ! push !
great !
i screwed up , mer .
mer , i screwed up . i really screwed up .
i can &apos;t --
hello .
oh . go back to sleep . i got this .
okay .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re doing good . you &apos;re being so good .
yeah . he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s fine .
this is all my fault . you know , i was -- i was at the park ,
and i looked away for a second when ross texted me .
i was -- i was standing right there .
listen , it &apos;s okay . these things happen .
and have you met our son ?
he lunges headfirst into everything .
it &apos;s a wonder this never happened sooner .
well , we can &apos;t go back to that park .
they need , like , sand or some of that soft turf stuff .
i mean , who puts concrete steps by a play space ?
it &apos;s completely irresponsible .
it is a superficial cut . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
i &apos;m already late for my meeting .
i can &apos;t just -- i can &apos;t just stick him in daycare , not when --
slow down . slow down , okay ?
now , we &apos;re gonna figure this out .
and , by the way , daycare has very capable teachers .
oh , please . i am capable .
so , your text said &quot; make sure the phase 3 patients go . &quot;
go to the bathroom ? go away ?
oh . sorry . i didn &apos;t realize . is he okay ?
yes .
no .
uh , do you want me to reschedule
the phase 3 patient meetings today ,
maybe try to squeeze them in next week , or--
no , just , um ...
ross , will you take them ? you understand the procedure .
you know what to do . just-- i --
you know , i want you to take over phase 3 from here .
what ?
what-- are you sure ?
yes . can you do this for me ? just do this for me , okay ?
of course , if that &apos;s what you want .
i can &apos;t believe bailey &apos;s already 7 .
please tell me he has outgrown that whole
&quot; i fiddle with my junk 24 / 7 &quot; phase ,
&apos;cause i have to practically duct @-@ tape theo &apos;s pants
on his body .
of all the conversations that you and i have had about boys ,
i didn &apos;t expect this one to be it .
feel any kicks yet ?
uh , no , not really .
nauseous ?
oh , just tired .
every day , i go to work and do my job .
then i come home and do that job .
i &apos;m so tired .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m sleepwalking all the time .
well , you &apos;re well into your second trimester now ,
so that &apos;ll start getting better .
it &apos;s not the pregnancy .
cristina ...
look how happy he is .
you &apos;re not dressed ?
we need to get going .
the harper avery awards await .
are you ... nervous ?
are you okay ?
do you need a minute ?
no .
maybe .
okay .
but just a minute .
and then nerves of steel .
right ?
right .
okay .
the surgical mind needs to be constantly inspired ,
always asking the toughest questions .
the harper avery award is a celebration of that ,
of the kind of mind i saw in tonight &apos;s recipient ,
even when he was just an intern .
ladies and gentlemen , i am honored to present to you
this year &apos;s harper avery award recipient
to dr. shane ross .
thank you . thank you .
first and foremost , i &apos;d like to thank dr. yang .
i wouldn &apos;t be here without your guidance ,
encouragement , and support .
all it takes is one person ,
one patient to change your life forever .
when i first met jasper o &apos;neil ,
he was 12 months old ,
and we didn &apos;t think he &apos;d make it to 13 .
he &apos;s here with us tonight .
jasper , would you stand up , please ?
cristina . cristina .
do you know who you are ?
do you know what &apos;s happened to you ?
do you want to live this way ?
i love you .
and i want you to know that whatever you decide ...
i &apos;ll support you .
i &apos;ll be by your side ...
no matter what .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to ask one more time .
jason ...
would you like me to remove the vent ?
son of a--
hey , you .
i just spent my day saving the life of a man
who could &apos;ve chosen to die but didn &apos;t .
i repaired a heart that was impossible to repair .
i achieved the impossible today , and it feels good .
no . more .
it feels ... incredible .
what are you doing right now ?
um ... waiting for the elevator .
yeah . we &apos;re gonna have to take the stairs ,
&apos;cause i just finished my shift , and i feel like celebrating ...
tonight ...
naked ...
with you .
oh . i could be into that .
are you ...
sure you &apos;re okay with this ?
oh , yeah , yeah . i &apos;m very sure .
no , no .
no , not -- not this .
us ...
being ...
just us .
i know .
and i &apos;m good .
i am .
you said you were okay . you told me ...
yeah , i know .
you told me that ...
i thought i was , okay ? but i &apos;m not .
what does that
i just need my films .
not right this second , though .
listen , all i am asking
is that we just reopen this conversation -- - no . no !
there is nothing left to talk about .
owen , i was clear about this .
i was so clear .
i can &apos;t give you more than what i am already giving .
and if now you need more --
yes , i think i do ! i think i do ! - if now --
well , then -- then get it somewhere else .
okay , i will .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s over .
no , this time , owen and i are really over .
i mean , we can &apos;t keep falling back into the same pattern .
it &apos;s just ...
mer ? you awake ?
yeah . you and owen are over again .
i &apos;m totally listening . continue .
well , see ? that &apos;s the point .
i @-@ it can &apos;t continue the way it is .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not healthy .
your heart &apos;s healthy enough now
that you &apos;d be an excellent candidate
for the type of research they &apos;re doing .
mm @-@ hmm .
could it hurt him ?
no . it is a surgery .
i would implant an array of wireless sensors into his skull
that would transmit electrical activity .
but none of our subjects ever complained of pain .
it &apos;s a chance to help us ,
to help revolutionize treatment for people like yourself .
what do you think , hon ?
it &apos;ll help people -- &quot; people like me ... &quot;
it won &apos;t help me ?
honey , wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have a place to go
instead of sitting around the house all day ?
it &apos;s something , jason . it &apos;s something we can do .
please ?
i don &apos;t care .
fine .
um , thank you , dr. yang , for thinking of us .
oh , no , actually , it was chief hunt &apos;s idea .
he -- he told us about jason .
oh , well , thank you , dr. hunt .
it &apos;s gonna be great for him .
well , good luck .
what ?
that was a really nice thing you did for them .
oh , well ... i &apos;m a really nice guy , or so i &apos;ve been told .
i would never ask you for that .
you &apos;re not asking . i am telling you .
well ...
i don &apos;t believe you .
cristina , people change .
i mean , you &apos;re not the same person that you were when we met .
i can change , too .
really ?
people who want kids don &apos;t just stop wanting them .
don &apos;t give up things for me .
hey , i &apos;m not .
i haven &apos;t .
i &apos;m not giving up anything .
good .
good . good .
yeah , slowly but surely .
just focus on your balance .
how does it feel , jase , to walk again ?
it &apos;s ...
pretty good .
yeah , i think he needs to concentrate .
it &apos;s amazing , in just a few years ?
unbelievable .
is dr.yang busy ?
i would love for her to see this .
i can check , okay ?
jason , are you all right ?
jason !
get a crash cart !
jason ?
hey , i need you .
yes . uh , no . i can &apos;t .
uh , these abstracts were supposed to go out an hour ago .
you know what ? okay . on @-@ call room , but fast ?
no , no , it &apos;s not , um -- it &apos;s jason castor .
he just had an accident in the bci lab .
he has rhabdo , renal failure .
grey is putting a shunt in him , but his wife &apos;s asking for you .
jason castor -- your patient , the quadriplegic ?
we , uh , put him into derek and callie &apos;s trial .
his wife is -- - oh ! right , right , right . yes . um ...
does he need a heart consult ?
no , no . she &apos;s just scared , and she trusts you --
you know , owen , i @-@ i have to finish this .
i &apos;ve got seven prints going .
where -- where &apos;s ross ?
ross can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m one step away from funding for animal trials .
owen , he &apos;s not my patient anymore .
if the guy &apos;s heart is fine ,
i don &apos;t have time to hold someone &apos;s hand right now .
you know what ? you saved her husband &apos;s life .
you were the first doctor she met .
she likes you , she trusts you , and now she &apos;s waiting for you .
about a million heart patients are waiting for me , too .
right .
you can &apos;t let people down .
thanks .
um , was it because of the suit ?
no . his kidneys failed , and that caused him to pass out .
but the surgery is going well ,
and then we &apos;ll get him on dialysis .
this is just a complication of jason &apos;s ... condition .
it &apos;s all just complications .
and he should be able to continue with the study , so --
he won &apos;t .
yeah , this -- this will be his excuse .
and he &apos;ll never forgive me for making him do it .
what ? you didn &apos;t make him do this .
he told me once -- w @-@ we were fighting ,
and he told me that when we woke him
to ask him if he wanted to live ,
he only said yes because he was looking at me --
that if it had been up to him ...
if i wasn &apos;t there ...
he would have said no .
so all this is because of me .
i mean , he -- he &apos;s miserable every day because of me .
and i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not a wife anymore .
i &apos;m a nursemaid and a cook and an orderly ,
and i never go home from that work .
i am that work . that &apos;s all i am anymore .
i wanted to have a child .
and i will never , ever have a child .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m being selfish . i &apos;m horrible .
no , you &apos;re not .
no , no , no , no . not at all .
not at all . i @-@ i totally understand .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
no . it &apos;s okay .
get on out !
okay , now , that is a healthy heart sip
that &apos;s both delicious and nutritious .
thank you very much for that .
next up , i &apos;m going to debunk the top five
biggest health myths for you folks ,
coming up right after this .
she better include my suggestion on too much calcium
increasing your risk of heart disease .
people pop those pills like candy .
i haven &apos;t seen you in two days .
yeah , i took a couple extra night shifts .
i @-@ i went by the trailer this morning .
yeah , i just crashed in the on @-@ call room .
is something going on ?
i need more , cristina . you know ?
i just can &apos;t keep ...
i just need more , you know --
more from you , more from us .
another , please ?
you got it !
okay , let &apos;s just get out of here .
nope .
let &apos;s go home . just sleep this off ,
and let &apos;s talk about it in the morning , can we --
we don &apos;t have a home , cristina .
i have a trailer , and you have a room at karev &apos;s house .
it &apos;s not ...
another , please .
right up !
there you go .
thank you .
there &apos;s too many .
the kids outnumber the adults .
should &apos;ve thought of that before we adopted again .
i mean , what if there &apos;s a mutiny ? derek and i will lose .
no , not until the third one can walk .
so , you broke up again ?
same thing , over and over .
you know what else is the same ?
this .
you and i laying in this bed , talking about you and owen .
why do you keep doing this to yourself ?
i need help .
mer , you have to help me .
don &apos;t let me go back to him --
for his good and mine .
please help me .
of course . of course i &apos;ll help you .
what do you mean ? it &apos;s been six months since my last procedure !
your hand &apos;s still not healed !
you need more p.t. and more time in the skills lab .
you are not stepping into that o.r. --
not today , maybe not ever !
all right , first of all , you need to lower your voice .
okay ! so , what , nobody can yell at you ?
why &apos;s that ? why is that ? !
because you &apos;re an avery ? excuse --
that has nothing to do with any of this .
and you -- some pampered little rich boy
who was gifted a hospital ...
so he thinks that it &apos;s okay to go ahead
and endanger patients ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s too damn proud to admit
that he can &apos;t operate anymore !
dr. hunt !
do you know how many infants are
born without a pulmonary artery ?
cristina , i &apos;m so sorry .
but there is a surgery to correct it .
it &apos;s called unifocalization ,

dr. cristina yang .

no , i don &apos;t .
i move to terminate him , effective immediately .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve learned over the years ,
it &apos;s that it only takes one person ,
one patient , one moment ,
to change your life forever --
to change your perspective , color your thinking ,
to force you to re @-@ evaluate everything you think you know ...
to make you ask yourself the toughest questions ...
do you know who you are ?
do you understand what has happened to you ?
do you want to live this way ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to ask one more time .
