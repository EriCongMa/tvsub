alan fitch directed me to that safe .
what does he want me to know ?
it is happening .
what is ? what &apos;s happening ?
aram , i need your assistance locating the source of a call
that was placed to a pay phone .
i can &apos;t stress enough the urgency of this matter .
i don &apos;t think you have any real comprehension
of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability .
but only the one who possesses the fulcrum
could possibly fathom that .
i don &apos;t think you have it . i don &apos;t think you ever did .
the fulcrum -- if you have it ,
if you can prove you have it , do it now .
your life depends on it .
i have the fulcrum .
tell me what it is , and i &apos;ll tell you where to find it .
yes .
i &apos;m the one who hired tom keen to enter your life .
here . this is all you wanted .
lizzy . lizzy !
raymond !
dembe !
what you &apos;re asking me to do ...
i appreciate that you turned yourself in .
you came back for me .
liz , i &apos;m in danger . i need the passports .
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
liz , please !
they &apos;re not just passports .
you hid them in a box under the floor in our home .
they represent everything i &apos;m trying to forget .
i know . i wouldn &apos;t ask yu unless it was important .
they &apos;re locked up in evidence .
that &apos;s exactly why they should still be clean .
i &apos;m not gonna walk into evidence
and steal them for you -- why would i do that ?
you want me gone ?
do this , and you &apos;ll never see me again .
you need to leave . go . now .

keen ? agent keen ?
dial &quot; star , seven , seven . &quot;

star , seven , seven .
77 . what is your location ?
who is this ?
what is your location ?
mr. kaplan ?
what is your location ?
capitol and &quot; m. &quot;
i don &apos;t know what mr. kaplan has planned ,
but we need to get him to a hospital right away .
no hospitals .
i &apos;m sorry , but we don &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;m not gonna let him die , and it can &apos;t wait .
mr. kaplan ?
there &apos;s a warehouse -- 5312 mass avenue .
say it back .
5312 mass avenue .
get there now . we &apos;ll be waiting .
who will ?
hold on . please . just hold on .
one of our men on euclid is dead .
and the target ?
hit . wounded . still in play .
they &apos;ll want to take our man to the m.e.
that cannot happen .
still alive .
i want eyes on any and all medical resources he has .
get someone to the crime scene
and find out how he got away and where he is hiding .
he &apos;s shot in the chest , right side .
entered the intercostal in the eighth rib .
absent breath sound in the right lung .
b.p. is 60 over palp . pulse is thready .
abdomen &apos;s distended . i need six units now .
x @-@ rays now .
give me a tube . give me a scope .
he dropped a lung -- stat chest tube .
you need --
you need to find leonard caul .
caul ?
leonard caul .
t @-@ t @-@ talk to dembe .
you need to find him , lizzy .
get that line in .
quick . stay with us .
gone ? what do you mean , gone ?
we instructed keen to go to the e.r. at university .
our people cleared the floor . they never showed .
there &apos;s been an attempted assassination
in broad daylight .
you know reddington was hit ,
and yet he and keen have disappeared ?
well , that was certainly trial by fire .
mr. attorney general .
not for another week .
not ever if the press has anything to say about it .
i &apos;m up there spinning gold about all the great things
justice will do under my leadership
when i &apos;ve got an aide whispering in my ear about --
we just found out ourselves .
harold , i was caught with my pants down ,
and as three ex @-@ wives can attest to ,
it &apos;s not a pretty sight .
keen &apos;s gone awol .
why were they meeting in the first place ?
were they working a case ?
i &apos;m not aware of the nature of the meeting .
harold , i don &apos;t need to tell you what &apos;s at stake here .
you need to contain this --
whatever it takes , whatever you need .
the full resources of my office are at your disposal .
thanks , tom .
excuse me for a moment .
cooper .
reddington &apos;s in surgery .
surgery ?
where ? we &apos;ve checked every e.r. in the city .
we &apos;re in a warehouse -- 5312 mass avenue .
he has some sort of mobile crash team .
dispatch units now .
reddington gave me a name .
who ?
leonard caul .
who is leonard caul ?
he must know something about the people who organized the hit .
so reddington knows who &apos;s behind this .
whoever they are came after reddington
because they thought he had this device , the fulcrum .
it &apos;s a blackmail file on a group , this cabal .
he told them he had it , and he didn &apos;t .
and they finally called his bluff and tried to kill him ,
and they will not stop until they do .
unless we find leonard caul .
there &apos;s nothing on him in the system .
according to dembe , before fitch died ,
he told reddington to find caul ,
that he would have information about the fulcrum , the cabal .
reddington asked aram to trace a call to an apartment ,
but when they got there , caul was gone .
all they found was blood -- no body .
well , he didn &apos;t tell me what it was for ,
and i , uh , definitely didn &apos;t ask ,
but i could probably still pull up the location .
all right , keen . we got a team on the way .
stay safe for 15 minutes , and you &apos;re home .
we need to find the tear . what are his vitals ?
b.p. is 90 over 60 , pulse 140 .
i &apos;m giving pressors and more fluids .
i need another unit of blood .
so , aram traced that call to an apartment
at 3130 sheridan road .
the name on the lease was an alias ,
but there was a police report filed by the apartment manager
who found blood in the home .
so we pulled the admission logs at the nearby e.r.s.
three gunshot wounds , six cases of domestic violence --
and one guy who comes in
with his two fingers in a ziplock bag .
leonard caul ?
he didn &apos;t leave a name .
there were cops in the e.r. , and when he saw them , he left .
how can you be sure it &apos;s the man we &apos;re looking for ?
we can &apos;t . but he left his fingers behind .
i want any surveillance from that e.r.
interview the doctors on call .
contact metro p.d. , see if they ran the prints .
we &apos;ve got company !
protective detail .
we &apos;ve got units securing the perimeter
and a chopper inbound to evac the patient .
no , we &apos;re not --
what the hell ? !
the bureau issues glocks or sigs .
whoever these gentlemen are , they &apos;re not fbi .
there will be more .
how long before we can ...
what &apos;s his status ?
what ?
his status , what is it ? can he be moved ?
no . m @-@ maybe . i don &apos;t know .
i need a definitive answer .
we have to go now .
go ? we can &apos;t go .
if we move him , he &apos;ll bleed to death .
we just now found the compromised artery .
we still have to cauterize it before we can close him .
so do it .
that was his job .
does anyone here have surgical training ?
two years , fresno state .
you &apos;re up , fresno .
they &apos;re coming .
yes , i responded to their message ,
but we don &apos;t have more than 15 or 20 minutes .
20 ? no . even he would need at least 30 minutes
to close this tear .
you have 15 .
no . absolutely not .
nick , please .
liz , i haven &apos;t heard from you for three years .
i wouldn &apos;t ask if i had any other choice .
find another doctor .
i had another doctor .
great . use him .
i can &apos;t .
why ?
did you turn down his marriage proposal , too ?
listen to me -- a man is going to die if you don &apos;t help us .
i &apos;m begging you .
where do you want me to go ?
what are you doing here ?
i live here .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
over here .
b.p. is 70 palp .
pulse is critical but stable .
this is for you , liz , not for him .
the protective detail is at the warehouse .
there &apos;s no sign of keen or reddington .
the shooter at the first crime scene ,
the emts who were taking him to the m.e. ,
they never showed .
there were three bodies found at the warehouse --
two men posing as fbi
and dr. mark child ,
chief of surgery at georgetown .
agent keen .
are you safe ?
who &apos;s with you ?
just us -- ressler , navabi , mojtabal .
and who dispatched the detail ?
the dc field office .
that must be where the leak came from .
where are you ?
a safe house .
give me an address . we &apos;ll send our own men now .
reddington &apos;s team is here . we &apos;re secure .
how is he ?
he &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t know for sure , but it &apos;s bad .
what do you need ? tell us , and we &apos;ll do it .
i need you to find leonard caul .
i thought you &apos;d be gone .
that was the plan .
then i thought maybe if i stayed ,
i &apos;d have a shot at a normal life .
does nik have any idea what you &apos;ve gotten him into ?
he &apos;s not a part of this . he &apos;s just a doctor .
reddington &apos;s a bad man , liz .
he &apos;s bad for anyone who comes in contact with him .
he &apos;s bad for you .
his world , this right here ,
unless you get out , this will devour you .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he &apos;s bad .
what matters is he has answers about me ,
and i &apos;m staying until i get them .
well , maybe i could help you get those answers .
i doubt that .
liz , i know a lot more about reddington than you think .
the bullet nicked the right lung .
i was able to reinflate it with a chest tube ,
and we &apos;ll start him on a prophylactic antibiotic .
what about the bullet ?
that &apos;s the problem .
it has a percussion cap ,
which causes it to essentially ...
explode .
by some miracle , it didn &apos;t .
if i try to remove it , if i touch it the wrong way ...
it &apos;s like there &apos;s a land mine inside him
and you &apos;re asking me to dig it up .
can you do it or not ?
we were never formally introduced .
i believe the only time we met
you were in her kitchen , making coffee in your underwear .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation , she dumped me , too .
can you do it ?
you may not remember , but i worked my way through school --
nights , weekends , and i still had to take out loans .
i busted my hump , and i am still $ 376,422 in debt .
can i do it ? absolutely .
for $ 376,422 .
i know who he is .
i don &apos;t why he &apos;s here
or what you have to do with him ,
but i know .
$ 500,000 -- unmarked , untraceable .
mr. reddington insists on being prepared for all contingencies .
shall we continue ?
we checked with ncic .
the prints they ran on our eight @-@ fingered mystery man
were a dead end .
no criminal record , no background checks .
he wasn &apos;t in their system .
but he was in mossad &apos;s .
leonard caul &apos;s real name is joseph mccray .
he &apos;s former cia .
last @-@ known photograph dates back to 1981 .
he was part of operation harwood ,
a covert surveillance unit run out of managua
to keep tabs on the sandinistas .
the agency knows who he is , but they won &apos;t say .
classified .
we can &apos;t find him because his job is to blend in .
he &apos;s basically eyes and ears -- nothing else .
he may as well have been a ghost .
harwood was run by a woman named helen jubal .
senate intelligence committee shut it down
in the wake of iran @-@ contra .
tom connolly was legal counsel .
you think connolly can get her to talk ?
i &apos;ll ask him .
we &apos;ve been trading a few favors lately .
i could be arrested for even acknowleging mr. mccray exists .
i as luck would have it , i know a few people in law enforcement .
tommy said you were a smooth operator .
he says you can help me find leonard caul ,
or the man you know as mr. mccray .
haven &apos;t spoken to him in years .
is that a fact ?
well , the unit broke up .
he didn &apos;t take it well , became --
ms. jubal , let &apos;s cut to it , shall we ?
mccray was an agent of yours . he &apos;s in trouble , on the run .
the next attorney general has given me carte blanche
to inquire as to his whereabouts .
anyone obstructing that inquiry will have to answer to him .
he came to me recently ,
said he &apos;d gotten himself wrapped up
in some kind of business with raymond reddington .
that &apos;s what this is about -- your hunt for reddington .
ms. jubal , tell me where he is .
he &apos;s scared , hurt , had no place to go --
i &apos;m assuming because of reddington .
if i tell you where he is ,
do you promise to use that information
only as a means to find reddington ?
you have my word .
elizabeth .
in bethesda , there &apos;s a small second @-@ story flat .
in the flat , you will find a desk .
the middle drawer has a false front .
remove it , and you will find a silver case along with a key .
this is about the fulcrum .
yes . you still have it .
i do .
this case , the key ...
i need you to bring them here to raymond , to leonard caul .
that &apos;s why reddington wanted us to find caul ,
because he can decipher the fulcrum .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
this flat ...
raymond can never know you were there .
do you understand , elizabeth ?
i would go if i could , but i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t leave him alone .
raymond must never know you were there .
where are we with this thing ?
according to agent keen , reddington is in surgery .
it &apos;s touch and go .
in surgery ? where ? what &apos;s their location ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
i suggest you take the liberty .
we have a lead on leonard caul .
helen jubal tipped us to a safe house in alexandria .
my people are looking into it .
that &apos;s not what i asked .
i asked for the location of reddington .
he &apos;s right to keep us out of the loop , reven .
you know the protocol .
if there &apos;s even the slightest suspicion of a leak ,
information is need @-@ to @-@ know .
i trust agent keen .
after the harbormaster ?
i &apos;m beginning to regret sweeping that under the rug .
she kept this fulcrum secret ,
a blackmail file on some nefarious group ,
and then she gave this file to reddington ?
i don &apos;t know that she gave it to him .
i appreciate your loyalty to agent keen , harold ,
but you have to admit there &apos;s a possibility
she &apos;s being completely manipulated by reddington .
what if the reason he chose her in the first place
is because he wanted to get his hands on this thing ?
what if that &apos;s the real reason he turned himself in ?
i don &apos;t believe that .
all this talk about some personal connection
between reddington and keen ,
why he chose her , some shared history --
what if reddington doesn &apos;t care about agent keen
and it &apos;s all been a manipulation ?
hey , sweetheart .
hi , kitty .
the doctor says you did well .
elizabeth ?
she &apos;s fine .
you need to go to my flat .
i &apos;m taking care of it .
you were right , dembe .
i should &apos;ve told her .
i understand why you didn &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t .
the blessing of an honest man .
she still hasn &apos;t found caul .
she won &apos;t .
but if she looks for him , he &apos;ll find her .
hello , agent keen ...
why don &apos;t we go back inside and have a little chat ?
don &apos;t take it .
you take that money , and he &apos;ll have his hooks in you .
trust me , it &apos;s the last thing you want .
i &apos;m not a criminal .
i &apos;ve never even gotten a speeding ticket .
don &apos;t take it .
when i heard you two were getting married ,
i was happy for her .
people said you were okay , a teacher .
later on , they told me you were planning
to adopt a child and start a family .
guess you two decided to go another route .
i won &apos;t take you to reddington .
yes , you will .
you tried to kill him in the street today ,
at the warehouse .
the cabal tried to kill him .
it &apos;s what they do -- eliminate their enemies .
you &apos;re leonard caul .
reddington sent you to find me .
what &apos;s your connection to reddington ?
alan fitch .
i believe he wanted us to meet .
shortly after reddington contacted me ,
there was an attempt on my life .
that &apos;s when i knew i could trust him .
when someone tried to kill you ?
yes , the cabal -- to keep us apart .
i &apos;ve been in hiding ever since , watching ,
waiting for a signal from reddington
that it was safe to meet .
he sent word earlier today .
he was shot earlier today .
i know .
he sent word after ...
through you .
he knew you &apos;d be watching .
i don &apos;t like having the fbi running my prints ,
accessing my covert files ,
talking with my former c.o ..
when i saw that happening ,
i knew it meant one of two things .
you either want to arrest me or talk to me .
which is it , agent keen ?
tell me what you know about the fulcrum .
is that the interface ?
you don &apos;t know how it works .
if you trust him , agent keen , you will show it to me .
it &apos;s what he wants .
he gave you a key .
you know , that day at the hospital ,
the day sam died , i think about that day a lot .
i worked for you two years -- we never met .
you were always this shadow ,
moving from place to place , talked about , but never seen .
and then ...
there you were .
to see you sitting there after i &apos;d betrayed your trust ,
gone to work for berlin , i was terrified .
i sat there listening to you threaten me ,
threaten anyone who could hurt liz .
and all i could think was you ...
you are the one who hurts liz the most .
she &apos;s here in this right now because of you .
and i know i played a part in that ,
and i &apos;m not saying i didn &apos;t , but ...
i &apos;m trying to fix that .
so i told her the truth about us .
i &apos;m telling you this because i don &apos;t want you
to be confused about my part in any of this --
you , liz ... all of it . i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m done .
there &apos;s a device -- it &apos;s called a &quot; bubble module . &quot;
it &apos;s the size of a quarter .
smartest person i know couldn &apos;t figure out how to read this .
that &apos;s because he didn &apos;t have the ciphertext .
how did you get it ?
i didn &apos;t get it .
i wrote it .
first time i saw it , i was speechless , too .
some of the names on that list , people , they &apos;re ...
c.e.o.s , defense contractors ,
intelligence officers from china , india ,
all over the world .
those names you saw , those are just the beginning .
you worked for fitch . he was part of it .
he &apos;d been cut out of the loop . director didn &apos;t trust him .
that &apos;s why fitch reached out to me .
the director ?
yes .
clandestine services .
wait , are you telling me the director of clandestine services ...
yes .
keep driving .
but we &apos;re here .
keep driving .
we &apos;re compromised .
you &apos;re surrounded .
where are you ?
we &apos;re close .
i don &apos;t know how many , but they &apos;re coming ,
and you need to be ready .
reddington , what &apos;s his condition ?
he &apos;s better .
but he &apos;s gonna get us all killed .
i &apos;m calling for backup .
i got hostiles at crescent to the north , more to the west .
give me a gun .
you don &apos;t want the help , i &apos;m happy to leave .
it &apos;s okay .
keen , where the hell are you ?
3295 thompson .
talk to me . what &apos;s going on ?
our site &apos;s been compromised .
i don &apos;t know by who , and right now i don &apos;t care ,
but reddington &apos;s inside , and he can &apos;t be moved .
i need you to send units now .
agent ressler , notify h.r.t ..
i want hopkins and his team only .
copy that .
we need to go back .
you &apos;re outnumbered .
we have to go back and help .
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
they &apos;re going to kill reddington .
they &apos;re gonna kill everyone . i @-@ i can &apos;t just walk away .
yes , you can , and if you know what &apos;s good ,
you &apos;re going to keep walking .
what does that mean ?
the director never believed that reddington had the fulcrum .
the moment fitch died , it was only a matter of time
before the director called his bluff .
that &apos;s it .
what ?
agent keen , what are you thinking ?
make it quick .
i &apos;ve got the national security council waiting .
how much resistance ?
i don &apos;t care what it takes .
i want the target eliminated .
go .
we have a situation .
what are you doing , kate ?
keeping you alive .
i &apos;m not leaving you , raymond .
you need to go .
find a way out .
i &apos;ll be fine .
and if i &apos;m not , you know what to do .
but you won &apos;t be able to do it unless you leave .
弗吉尼亚州 兰利市
president approved it , as well .
yes , i @-@ i understand that .
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry , but there &apos;s an agent here to see you .
oh , not now .
it &apos;s elizabeth keen .
she says she has information about something called the fulcrum .
thank you .
we are going to have to postpone .
the president is expecting us to get back --
the president will have to wait .
if you &apos;ll excuse us .
that will be all .
i admire your nerve , agent keen ,
barging in here like this .
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too late .
well , then you &apos;re gonna have to read about this
in tomorrow &apos;s new york times .
the fulcrum .
you didn &apos;t think reddington had it .
well , here it is , and it tells quite a story --
political assassinations , terrorism .
we know who you are , what you &apos;ve done .
you called reddington &apos;s bluff , and you lost .
call it off .
i told you it &apos;s too late .
pick up the phone right now and call it off .
you have no idea the enemies you just made .
i &apos;m afraid i do .
you can keep that . we have copies .
i never saw it before .
saw what ?
how much you look like your mother .
lizzy .
we &apos;ve cleared a wing at sibley memorial
for you and your medical team .
cooper will oversee your security personally .
lizzy .
when i hired tom keen --
don &apos;t .
there &apos;s nothing you can say .
when i hired tom keen , it was ...
at a time of profound transition in your life .
you &apos;d already left behind
the relative safety and innocence of youth .
sam &apos;s care as a father had served you well ,
but you &apos;d outgrown him .
a @-@ and i knew that
eventually my life would jeopardize yours .
so , in an admittedly presumptuous
and ultimately futile effort to keep you safe ,
i hired tom simply to be there
as a friend of a friend
to look after you from an arm &apos;s length .
when i learned that your relationship had become intimate ,
i fired him .
i should &apos;ve removed him ,
but you were already in love with him .
and tom , he shifted his allegiance to berlin
in part to protect himself from me ,
but also because it allowed for an inextricable intimacy
and commitment to you .
and so you were married .
and i couldn &apos;t stay away any longer .
a confluence of peril had entered your life ,
and i wanted to be within reach ,
to have influence .
i turned myself in to the fbi
to point you toward a truth
that inevitably
you would have to discover for yourself .
is that all of it ?
some of it .
why couldn &apos;t you just have said yes ?
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to lie just once
to make someone feel good .
i understand you &apos;re conflicted .
lives were lost today .
but the work we do is important .
we help provide peace , stability .
children can go to school , families to church
without fear --
or certainly with less of it because of us .
and you wanted to be a part of that .
it &apos;s a solemn responsibility ...
and , on days like today , a heavy one .
and few people are capable of honoring that responsibility .
you are -- we know that , and we believe in you .
we also know that we asked you to betray a friend .
well , you want a seat at the table .
now you have one .
came as soon as i could .
i think you &apos;re right .
reddington ...
what happened today ...
i think it &apos;s gonna devour me .
what i said ...
what i meant was that it would devour most people .
it &apos;s not gonna devour you .
you said you could help me find answers .
yeah . i think i can .
tell me what you know about reddington .
