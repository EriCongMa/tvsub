you walked out of our session because you didn &apos;t want
to talk about your mother .
you &apos;re insane .
and you &apos;re a self @-@ serving narcissist
who will do or say anything to get what he wants .
it &apos;s my sister &apos;s company . i &apos;ll give you her business .
all you have to do is handle her divorce .
all right , i &apos;ll do it .
promise me you won &apos;t sleep with esther .
the last thing i want to do is sleep with your sister .
would you like to take me home tonight ?
i would .
jack soloff signed fletcher as a client
and now i have to let mckernon go .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re in this position right now .
i &apos;m not the one who put you in it .
jack soloff is .
this is your last chance to work with me .
take it and you have a future ,
don &apos;t and you can go ask daniel hardman for a job .
i &apos;m ready to talk about my mother .
mom ?
mom ?
harvey .
what are you-- what are you doing here ?
i got sent home from school .
i threw up .
oh , well , let &apos;s get you to bed .
hey , lil , i was thinking that--
who &apos;s that ?
honey , you remember
our cousin-- my cousin scott ?
no .
course you do . he &apos;s cousin judy &apos;s brother .
i don &apos;t feel good .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re burning up .
let &apos;s get you to bed .
and let &apos;s not tell dad about cousin scott .
okay ? &apos; cause they don &apos;t get along .
come on .
you poor thing .
&quot; you poor thing . &quot; that &apos;s what stuck with me .
she said &quot; you poor thing , &quot;
but she didn &apos;t give a shit about me .
and did you know what you saw ?
no , i just knew something was wrong .
and you didn &apos;t tell your father ?
she told me not to .
and you trusted her ?
i did .
harvey , i never thought i &apos;d be saying this to you ,
but i &apos;m proud .
it took an amazing amount of courage to tell me that .
we &apos;re not gonna hug , are we ?
no , we &apos;re not .
but it does feel good to end a session
on a positive note for once .
peterson case , huh ?
i remember when i used to handle that asshole .
funny , i don &apos;t remember inviting you into my office .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s right , it must be because
it &apos;s something that i would never do .
listen , mike , i know i pulled some shit with you and louis ,
but i &apos;m here to make things right with you .
not interested .
just hear me out .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s a case that &apos;s tailor @-@ made for someone
with a hedge fund background .
new york teacher &apos;s pension fund
just lost 30 % of their annual income .
they put half their portfolio in derivatives without hedging ?
not just derivatives . derivatives created
and marketed by strauss bank
to increase their own revenue .
sorry , jack , i don &apos;t work with people that i don &apos;t trust
and i don &apos;t trust somebody who comes to me saying their trying
to make things right without a good reason .
you want the reason ? jessica told me to .
yeah , well , she didn &apos;t tell me .
and until she does ...
you can get out of my office .
the simon brief is on your desk
and i moved your wednesday noon meeting to five .
why &apos;d you do that ?
because anthony kimball &apos;s most honest
with a drink in him .
and on top of that ,
i wouldn &apos;t want you to have to work too hard
on your birthday .
what ? it &apos;s not my birthday .
oh , come on , you can tell me .
what is it ? 48 ? 49 ?
the big 6 @-@ 0 ?
a : i &apos;m not the one pushing 60 .
you better not be talking to me .
b : if it were , i &apos;d be drinking with someone
a lot prettier than anthony kimball .
then why is wednesday night permanently blocked out
on your calendar ?
donna .
harvey .
you look busy .
i look busy because i am busy .
too busy to join me at del posto on wednesday night ?
harvey , we don &apos;t need to do that anymore .
then why did you leave it
permanently blocked off on my calendar ?
because i did that a long time ago
and when i left your desk i forgot to undo it .
then why don &apos;t we pretend that you forgot
to undo it on purpose ?
i don &apos;t work for you anymore .
what would we be celebrating ?
instead of celebrating the day you came to my desk ,
how about we celebrate ...
two weeks of being on decent terms ?
it &apos;s only been a week and a half .
seriously , donna ?
i don &apos;t just want to be on decent terms .
i want to get back to being friends .
that &apos;s really nice , harvey .
see you wednesday night .
thank you .
jessica .
what a pleasant surprise .
i think we both know that it isn &apos;t .
pleasant ? or a surprise ?
either .
because we also both know that jack soloff
came to see you before i did .
is there a problem with that ?
there is if you &apos;re colluding
with one of my partners to take over my firm .
jack came to me
asking for advice about how to land a new client .
he was so determined i was suddenly reminded
of harvey &apos;s first client .
mckernon motors .
a client he cared so much about
he gave up a promotion
just to keep his word .
it &apos;s hard to forget a move like that .
it &apos;s also hard to forget your history
of worming your way back into my firm .
so , if you &apos;re looking for someone to mentor , daniel ,
go find yourself an afterschool program .
but stay the hell outta my house .
jessica ...
i have no interest in your shitty firm
and i don &apos;t have to enter your house to damage it .
you did that all by yourself
the second you let fletcher engines go .
jack tell you that ?
fletcher engines told everyone that .
and you told your entire firm that you care more about
harvey specter than you do about them .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a meeting
in my new office .
it &apos;s so nice to be back in the city .
clean out your things and get the hell out of my firm .
what ?
i gave you one last chance
to play nice , and you blew it .
how did i blow it ?
oh , you &apos;re going to deny
that you &apos;ve been spreading word around the office
that i told you to drop fletcher engines ?
yes . i &apos;m gonna deny it , because i didn &apos;t do it .
then how the hell does everybody know ?
because i told them when i signed fletcher .
which i wouldn &apos;t have done if i &apos;d known
you were gonna drop them
because it made me look like shit .
well , it didn &apos;t make me come out smelling like a rose either .
and your mentor seems to have known that .
he &apos;s not my mentor .
i went to him for advice ,
and all it got me was almost getting fired .
but you said you &apos;d give me one more chance ,
and i &apos;ve been trying to take it .
give me one good example of that .
i approached mike ross to work with me this morning .
and by the way , he spat in my face .
jessica ...
you made your point and i heard you .
if you &apos;re just gonna fire me anyway ,
why give me the chance in the first place ?
a joke ? uh , do you hear me laughing ?
10 % is 11 % more than you deserve .
i--
what the hell ?
this better be important .
i was just about to close a deal .
i just heard a rumor
that jack soloff signed fletcher engines .
that &apos;s ridiculous--everyone knows we can &apos;t sign fletcher
if we represent mckernon .
i &apos;ll tell you what everyone knows , louis .
jack signed fletcher .
jessica forced him to drop them ,
and the only reason jack would have done that
in the first place is if you were fired by mckernon .
harvey , i can explain .
god damn it . i knew it .
just wait a minute . harvey , listen to me .
jack set us up .
he acted as if he was cooperating
when all along he was looking to blow up the deal .
why the hell didn &apos;t you come to me when it happened ?
because we wanted to fix it ourselves .
wanting to fix it yourself
is the cause of every problem you and i have ever had ,
and now you &apos;re teaching that bullshit to mike ?
you know what , mike and i worked on that deal together ,
and we kicked ass .
i &apos;m happy , mike &apos;s happy , dominic &apos;s happy ,
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
because i &apos;m a damn good attorney , and you know it .
so if that &apos;s the only thing you came in here for ,
i would like to close my deal now .
mr. specter , esther litt just called .
she has an urgent matter . needs to see you right away .
did she say what it was about ?
no . just not to tell her brother .
oh , so this is where the little people get their caffeine .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not here to have a breakfast bar .
i &apos;ve never had a breakfast bar in my life .
i want to thank you for taking on that pension case
with jack soloff .
i didn &apos;t take on
the pension case with jack soloff .
yes , you did .
jessica , no .
you can &apos;t make me work with that man .
i can make you work
with the goddamn window washers if i want to .
and if you don &apos;t do this , you might find yourself
dangling 50 stories above the ground .
why ?
because i asked jack to make peace ,
and you &apos;re the one he chose to reach out to ,
so you &apos;re the one to do this .
i guess i meant why don &apos;t you just fire him ?
if i fired every ambitious attorney
that ever took me on ,
there &apos;d be nobody left here but me and harold gunderson .
wait a second--you know who harold gunderson is ?
i know who everybody is .
and before you say one more word ,
if i ever start handing out pink slips for troublemakers ,
you &apos;d be the first in line .
right .
i came here as soon as i got your message .
i don &apos;t do that for most people .
so much for hard to get .
i think we &apos;re past that .
did jeffrey get greedy again ?
no . a man named kenneth jackson
is claiming my nut @-@ free muffins
put him in anaphylactic shock .
what happened ? too much gluten ?
not enough gluten ?
harvey ,
this isn &apos;t funny . this is my company ,
and my entire brand is based on quality .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll take it seriously .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me . thank louis .
because he &apos;s gonna handle this case .
what ?
this is a business matter , not personal .
and i &apos;m not stealing louis &apos;s client .
you &apos;re not stealing me . you already handled my divorce .
are you gonna tell me that louis is a better lawyer than you ?
no . i &apos;m gonna tell you that he &apos;s a damn good lawyer ,
and he &apos;d do anything to project you .
that &apos;s not the point .
i need this to go away quietly ,
and louis doesn &apos;t do anything quietly .
then tell him that .
he never listens to me .
then get him to listen or get another law firm ,
because i &apos;m not taking this case .
harvey , i don &apos;t need another firm .
i need you .
you know what i think ?
i think you want to go out with me again ,
and you came to me with this
because you &apos;re afraid to say it to me .
i don &apos;t believe you !
you think i concocted a lawsuit against my own company
just to tell a man i &apos;ve already been with
that i like him ?
sure looks that way .
in that case ,
i guess i do have the wrong man for the job .
thank you for taking the time .
please let him know i &apos;m here .
esther .
what are you doing here ?
i thought i was very clear yesterday .
i &apos;m not taking your case .
you were clear .
i &apos;m here to see louis .
but it &apos;s nice to see your ego &apos;s as strong as ever .
i &apos;m sorry ... and i didn &apos;t mean to be such a dick yesterday .
it &apos;s okay , harvey . i know what you did .
you accused me of what you accused me of ,
so i will go to louis .
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
it was actually sweet ...
in a dick @-@ ish sort of way .
that &apos;s my specialty .
thanks , harvey .
hi , esther , i &apos;m donna paulsen .
i &apos;m the--
i know who you are .
you &apos;re the best thing
that &apos;s ever happened to my brother .
oh . well , you don &apos;t know the half of it .
anyway , i hope i didn &apos;t put you to too much trouble
on short notice .
oh , nonsense .
louis was thrilled when he heard you were coming in .
what was so goddamn important
that i had to cancel my entire morning ?
i swear he was happy to do it .
and you and i are having lunch
the second whatever it is you &apos;re here for is over .
want a sip ?
is that a prunie ?
no ! i can &apos;t believe you still drink that crap .
you know i &apos;ve got grandma gertie &apos;s spastic colon .
what he hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;m being sued .
holy shit .
your shitty muffins really did give someone salmonella .
it &apos;s not salmonella ,
and louis , this is serious .
it &apos;s my company .
all right , i &apos;m sorry .
well , does he have a leg to stand on ?
of course not .
i do an audit of every supplier every three months .
are you sure ? because if we &apos;re gonna
go after him with everything we &apos;ve got--
louis , we &apos;re not going after him at all .
i want to settle this quickly and quietly .
esther ...
you settle , you look guilty .
this is a shakedown , pure and simple .
i know that , but i don &apos;t care .
this is a business decision .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m trying
to stop others from doing the same thing .
i &apos;m telling you , i know what i &apos;m doing .
i didn &apos;t say you don &apos;t .
no , you &apos;re just telling me how to do my job .
louis , i came to you because you &apos;re my brother ,
and i am telling you , this is what i need .
all right , we &apos;ll settle .
thank you , louis .
no , thank you .
for what ?
for not going to harvey .
once he handled your divorce ,
i would have thought you &apos;d want him to handle everything .
执行合伙人
harvey , make yourself comfortable .
can i get you a mimosa ?
no , thanks .
i just stopped by to eat my morning bagel
and ask why jack soloff
tried to sign fletcher engines
and you didn &apos;t tell me .
i didn &apos;t tell you because i was busy fixing it .
and did fixing it involve figuring out
that he went to daniel hardman ?
as a matter of fact , it did .
you saw hardman .
i did , and it didn &apos;t take long ,
because he &apos;s back in new york .
let me guess .
he said he had nothing to do with any of this .
yep . he said he was just giving jack some helpful advice .
well , i think it &apos;s time
we gave jack some helpful advice of our own ,
like get your ass another job .
now , harvey , i met with jack .
he says he &apos;s done confiding in hardman ,
and i &apos;ve decided to consider the matter closed .
you telling me you trust that clown ?
now , i may look damn good for my age ,
but i wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
you want to know how deep it goes with him and hardman ,
don &apos;t you ?
i sure as hell do .
which is why i asked mike to work with jack
and play nice ,
and you better not get in the way .
this doesn &apos;t look like
a &quot; forgive me for being a dick &quot; card .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a 28 @-@ page interrogatory for strauss bank .
thanks .
what are you doing ?
you told me you don &apos;t work with people you don &apos;t trust .
neither do i.
you don &apos;t have to trust me to understand
that the shady shit at strauss bank
starts at the top .
all the way to the top ?
there &apos;s a 50 @-@ 50 chance that the ceo knows .
the cfo had tohad to know .
all we have to do is get their emails .
that &apos;s easy .
we agree not to pursue criminal charges ,
they &apos;ll hand emails over right now .
we can &apos;t give up the threat of going to prison .
that &apos;s what gives us leverage . we have to go to court .
going to court will take forever .
i just went through the same thing with robert zane .
why don &apos;t you pick up the phone
and ask him who turned out to be right ?
you know , i heard you were cocky ,
but i had no idea .
you &apos;re the one who came to me looking to make peace .
you wanna make peace or not ?
all right . we &apos;ll try it your way .
rachel , what can i do for you ?
i heard about esther ,
and i was hoping i could help .
i appreciate the offer ,
but i &apos;m gonna take care of this one myself .
and i &apos;m not trying to interfere .
i just thought it would be nice to learn
from the most talented , diligent ,
and respected partner that we have here .
yeah , you &apos;re just trying to butter me up .
is it working ?
handsome .
listen to me .
she &apos;s my sister .
she &apos;s being sued .
last time she had a problem , she went to harvey ,
but this time she &apos;s coming to me ,
and i &apos;m not gonna farm any of it out .
can you understand that ?
the reason i want on this case
is that i admire esther and her company ,
and if someone &apos;s coming at her with a frivolous lawsuit ,
then ... i don &apos;t care how little i do .
i just want to help you .
paperwork &apos;s right here .
your honor , as you can see ,
there &apos;s been clear negligence at best ,
deliberate deception at worst .
not to mention
a breach of fiduciary duty .
i &apos;m inclined to agree .
your honor , the only thing that &apos;s clear
is his clients chose a risky investment .
that &apos;s not deception on our part .
the deception is he created those derivatives ,
he knew how risky they were , and he sold them to us anyway .
i have $ 2 billion in investment funds .
you think i review every investment ?
i don &apos;t know , but you sure as hell reviewed this one .
and where &apos;s your proof ?
we don &apos;t have any ... yet .
which is why we &apos;re requesting access to these emails .
this isn &apos;t about getting their emails .
this is about determining if trial &apos;s moving forward .
and it is .
i &apos;ll set the email discovery hearing
for three weeks .
three weeks ?
uh , your honor ,
my wife has surgery in three weeks .
i &apos;d like to request an additional month .
bullshit she has surgery .
scheduled c @-@ section at columbia presbyterian .
then put someone else on the case .
that &apos;s not how it works .
if i may ...
if we agree not to pursue criminal charges in this matter ,
will you give us the emails within the week ?
you agree to that right here ,
i &apos;ll give &apos; em to you tomorrow .
then we have a deal .
wanna tell me what kind of kickback you &apos;re getting ?
excuse me ?
you went behind my back .
i didn &apos;t do anything behind your back .
i did it in front of your face .
you know what i mean-- you gave up on leverage
by handing him a get out of jail free card ,
which means you &apos;re either in their pocket
or you &apos;re using this case
so you can sign them once it &apos;s over .
what did you just say to me ?
you heard me .
you shook that guy &apos;s hand like you were his goddamn cousin .
you listen to me . if they wanted to be my client ,
i &apos;d take them . but i didn &apos;t do that
to kiss his ass .
i did it to get what we needed .
we already had what we needed .
no , we didn &apos;t .
we had a hearing on it in seven weeks ,
and that c @-@ section bullshit was just the tip of the iceberg .
between now and then , they &apos;d have figured out a way
to put it off for another two years .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
i said i would try it your way , and it didn &apos;t work .
well , now those emails are coming .
are you gonna help me or not ?
louis , i need to talk to you--we have a problem .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong
is kenneth jackson &apos;s lawyer .
her name &apos;s lisbeth wexler ,
and this isn &apos;t her first frivolous suit .
well , it never is with these people .
that doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t settle .
okay . you don &apos;t understand .
i went through dozens of her cases .
every time she gets an offer ,
she threatens to go public with it .
shit .
what ?
that &apos;s exactly what i was afraid of .
okay , well , then you know it &apos;s not a big deal .
we can handle it , but we can &apos;t give them an offer .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
i tried to tell esther this might happen ,
but then she made me promise
that i would make this thing go away without any trouble .
okay , well , if we don &apos;t do something other than settle ,
she &apos;s in for a hell of a lot more trouble .
he didn &apos;t really say that .
oh , not only did he say it , but i had to transcribe it
word for word off his dictaphone .
what ?
no , i just realized
i haven &apos;t thought about jack soloff
and his bullshit for two hours .
glad we did this , harvey .
me , too . we should do it more often .
well , i &apos;m not sure how mitchell would feel about that .
who &apos;s mitchell ?
he &apos;s the man that i &apos;ve been seeing
for the last six weeks .
he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s smart and he &apos;s funny and ...
best of all , he has nothing to do with the practice of law .
i &apos;m happy for you , donna .
thanks .
and the reason i told you
is so that you &apos;ll know that i &apos;m not jealous
when i say ...
you need to tell louis
you &apos;ve been sleeping with esther .
what ?
oh , please .
it took me all of two seconds to put it together
after i saw you two mooning over each other this morning .
it &apos;s not what you think .
we bonded together during her divorce proceedings .
harvey , you said you wanted to be friends .
this is me being your friend .
friends don &apos;t accuse each other of things .
i &apos;m not accusing you . i &apos;m looking out for you .
how is that looking out for me ?
because , like i said , you need to tell him .
well , you know what ? i don &apos;t need to do that
because , for once , your radar is off .
we haven &apos;t been sleeping together .
we slept together one time .
what difference does that make ?
you promised him you wouldn &apos;t do it at all .
donna , louis isn &apos;t rational on his best days
with issues that don &apos;t involve his sister ,
now , how is he going to take it if i do what you &apos;re asking ?
and how do you think he &apos;s gonna react
when he finds out you kept this from him ?
he &apos;s not gonna find out .
yes , he is .
because i didn &apos;t have to be me to see the way
you two looked at each other .
and someday louis is gonna see that , too .
donna , i appreciate you telling me this as a friend .
now , as a friend , i &apos;m telling you
to mind your own business .
i was right . you cut them some side deal .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i went through all their emails
and i found them nothing tying them to anything .
which means you knew they would leave some emails out
and you let it go to get something out of it .
i didn &apos;t know they would leave anything out ,
but i thought they might
and i am gonna get something out of it ,
but it &apos;s not what you think .
what are you talking about ?
your idea of threatening prison was right ,
but nobody ever went to jail
for selling shitty securities .
they go to jail for destroying evidence .
so , instead of proving to some jury
that doesn &apos;t understand securities law
that these guys knew the risks of their investments--
all we have to do is prove they deleted some emails .
i &apos;m sorry .
take a seat .
you know that &apos;s the second time in two days
that you jumped right to me being the bad guy ?
well , you have to admit , my experience
with how you treated me and louis
was you being the bad guy .
fair enough .
but were you there when louis lied to my face
about backing me in a meeting ?
or when he told jessica
that i did something awful that he , in fact , did ?
no , i wasn &apos;t .
but you do know him
and what he &apos;s capable of .
and you &apos;re somehow on good terms with him .
i &apos;m on good terms with him
because i &apos;ve seen other sides of him .
well , i have other sides , too .
i may have done some office backstabbing ,
but i have never done anything to indicate to you
that i would do something illegal .
which is what you came in here accusing me of .
okay , jack .
you can have a chance to show me another side of yourself , too .
i told you to settle this thing !
and i &apos;m trying to .
then why did i just get a notice that the fda
is investigating my company ?
what ?
what did you do ?
i was gonna settle , but then rachel found out
their lawyer has history of blackmailing companies
so our only option was to counter @-@ sue .
you filed a counter @-@ suit against my explicit instructions ?
you know what , esther ? you came to me for help ,
and i don &apos;t tell you how to bake your muffins .
because you don &apos;t know the first thing about my business .
and you don &apos;t know the first thing about mine .
i don &apos;t have to . i know you .
and you &apos;ve got a chip on your shoulder
the size of montana and when it comes out ,
you make everything worse .
you know what , esther ?
i was right to do what i did .
and , for once , i &apos;m not gonna let you
treat me like i &apos;m less than you .
less than me ?
yes , less than you !
i &apos;m always your buffoon brother .
well , not this time .
you had no right to do this without asking me !
i didn &apos;t ask you because you wouldn &apos;t have listened .
no , you never listen !
which is why i wanted to go to harvey in the first place !
what ?
you heard me .
how could you betray me like that ?
i wasn &apos;t betraying you .
i was looking out for myself .
if you were looking out for yourself ,
then why did you lie to me about going to him ?
because you &apos;re always jealous
whenever i ask anyone else to do anything .
you &apos;re my brother , louis , not my boyfriend .
if you wanted harvey so much , why don &apos;t you go to him right now ?
i can &apos;t .
because when i went to him ,
he told me i should trust you .
he really said that ?
he didn &apos;t just say that .
he said you were a damn good lawyer .
i am a damn good lawyer .
but i should have told you .
well ...
what are we gonna do now ?
that depends on if you think you can trust me or not .
i can .
morning , louis .
good morning .
where the hell were you ? i text you like 18 times .
yes , and if it had been an emergency ,
i would have called you back .
it was an emergency .
louis , running out of paper clips is not an emergency .
i know , it &apos;s just that i ...
needed you , and i couldn &apos;t reach you ,
and that &apos;s never happened before .
i was having dinner with harvey .
harvey ?
yes .
we &apos;re trying to stay friends .
friends ?
yes , friends .
i &apos;m not going back to him , louis .
what ? i know that .
how &apos;d it go ?
it was fine .
he didn &apos;t happen to bring up esther , did he ?
what ? why would he do that ?
because apparently , she went to him
before she came to me .
well , he did handle her divorce .
i know , it &apos;s just ...
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible that
anything happened between them , do you ?
i don &apos;t know , louis , i mean ...
look , i do know that we talked about a lot of things last night ,
and esther wasn &apos;t one of them .
you &apos;re right .
harvey would never make a promise like that to me
and then break it .
i &apos;m glad you had a nice dinner , donna .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s a stack of emails they left out .
how did you get them ?
doesn &apos;t matter how i got them . it matters that i got them .
it does matter , because if you got them illegally ,
then we can &apos;t use them , and you know it .
i didn &apos;t get them illegally .
then why won &apos;t you tell me where you got them ?
because there are some things i like to keep to myself .
and didn &apos;t you give me a speech
about getting to know different sides of you ?
well , this is a different side of me .
are you gonna trust it or not ?
gentlemen ,
i &apos;m so glad you could see us on such short notice .
well , you scratched our backs .
i think we can scratch yours .
what kind of settlement are you looking for ?
we &apos;re not looking for a settlement .
we &apos;re looking for you to give up your ceo .
what ?
he &apos;s not giving anyone up .
you &apos;ve waived your rights
to criminal charges in this matter .
yeah , we &apos;re not talking about this matter .
we &apos;re talking about conspiracy to hide evidence .
that &apos;s 200 e @-@ mails from your analyst
laughing about the suckers that you all ripped off .
shit .
relax . there &apos;s no way he got those legally .
you &apos;re right , we didn &apos;t .
what ?
god damn it , you told me--
i know what i told you , jack ,
but you wouldn &apos;t have let me come here
if i told you the truth .
and the truth ...
is that we also got this one illegally .
that &apos;s your ceo saying that if push comes to shove ,
he &apos;s gonna throw you under the bus .
and you really want to take a chance
that we won &apos;t figure out a way to find these others legally ?
you &apos;ve got 200 people in your firm ?
we &apos;re gonna offer every single one of them immunity
to admit they exist .
and when they do , either your ceo is going down ,
or you are .
glad you came to your senses and called us to settle .
well , clearly , mr. jackson
has suffered great physical harm .
i just don &apos;t want anyone else to be hurt .
yeah , that &apos;d be a shame .
then who would you have to sue ?
excuse me ?
sit down .
now , we &apos;re here because my sister
wanted to give you $ 50,000 to make this thing go away ,
but i didn &apos;t listen to her .
so i &apos;m gonna throw in an extra $ 50,000 of my own .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
because if you think we &apos;re gonna settle for $ 100,000,
you &apos;re wasting our time .
the $ 100,000 isn &apos;t to settle this .
it &apos;s to have your client admit that you approached him
after he had a public episode
and then instructed him to say that it was within five minutes
of eating one of our muffins .
you have no proof of that .
no , we don &apos;t .
but he &apos;s on record for making a false statement
to a federal agency ,
which means when we do have proof ,
you &apos;re gonna be in prison for a very , very long time .
$ 100,000 ?
kenneth , you &apos;ll get 20 times
that when we win .
maybe this &apos;ll help you decide , kenneth .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a list of all the other people you &apos;ve done this with .
what ?
oh , did you think you were her first ?
you were not .
whoever rolls over first gets the money ,
then the rest get to line up for orange jump suits .
that &apos;s enough . we &apos;re leaving .
what do i have to do ?
esther , what are you doing here ?
i came to give you this .
this is a $ 100,000 check .
it &apos;s for kenneth jackson .
we &apos;re splitting this .
no , we &apos;re not .
you were right .
i never should have tried to settle with him in the first place .
you saved me more than that .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
say you &apos;ll forgive me .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a buffoon , louis ,
and i never have .
but i didn &apos;t realize how good a lawyer you were
until i saw it myself .
i appreciate that .
but i know how hard you worked
to make your business happen ,
and i know what you gave up ,
and there wasn &apos;t a snowball &apos;s chance in hell
that i was gonna let someone take advantage of you .
thanks , louis .
thank you .
do you wanna get dinner tonight ?
i can &apos;t tonight . how about tomorrow night ?
tomorrow night is perfect .
what do you say we also invite donna ?
that &apos;d be really nice .
come by just to tell me how impressive i was today ?
i came by to ask you why you still don &apos;t trust me .
who says i don &apos;t trust you ?
you didn &apos;t tell me that evidence was obtained illegally .
jack ... i told you the truth .
those emails weren &apos;t obtained illegally because ...
they weren &apos;t even real .
what ?
i know how traders talk .
i know exactly what they &apos;d say , so ...
i just wrote them myself .
are you shitting me ?
take a look .
i lied to you
because to get them to believe they were illegal
i had to get them to believe they were real .
and you needed me to be pissed to help you do that .
told you to trust me .
you know what ?
i do .
so to tell you the truth ,
when we started this thing ,
i was just doing it to kiss your ass
so jessica would forgive me .
but ...
you &apos;re the real deal .
i see what harvey sees in you .
thanks , jack .
maybe now you can give harvey a second chance too .
it &apos;s just everything comes so easy to him .
jessica plucks him from the mailroom .
youngest senior partner ever .
i been busting my ass for 20 years .
nobody ever does anything like that for me .
well , i &apos;ll tell you something , jack .
he &apos;s got his own problems just like everyone else .
and if you want to get along with me ,
you better figure out a way to get along with him .
gretchen , where were we at with the cabrillo claim ?
i have to go .
i &apos;m not gretchen .
and that &apos;s too bad for you ,
because she &apos;s still in the habit of covering for you .
covering for me for what ?
i told you louis was gonna find out about esther .
and i told you it &apos;s none of your business .
well , it became my business
when louis asked me about it yesterday ,
and i had to lie to his face
just to get him to leave it alone .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do that .
yes , you did , and you know it .
donna , i don &apos;t have time for this .
i have an appointment--
what appointment ?
i checked with gretchen
so you couldn &apos;t get out of this with some made @-@ up thing .
your calendar &apos;s empty .
you know what , donna ?
one thing i learned the hard way
is not to tell your secretary everything .
be careful , harvey .
because you &apos;re about to learn the hard way
that i may have lied to louis about this once ,
but i am never , never gonna do it again .
harvey ?
harvey , where have you been for the last 40 minutes ?
what are you talking about ?
i mean , you scheduled a session
so that we could explore your mother ,
and you &apos;ve been telling me some meaningless story
about when you got stung by a bee .
i got in a fight with donna .
fight about what ?
she wants me to tell louis that i slept with his sister .
why , exactly , does she want you to do that ?
because i promised louis that i wouldn &apos;t ,
and she thinks he &apos;s gonna find out .
why would you make a promise like that to louis
if you had no intention of keeping it ?
i had every intention of keeping it .
it &apos;s louis &apos;s sister .
but then i met her , and ...
it happened .
well , why don &apos;t you just tell him that ?
because he &apos;s like a four @-@ year @-@ old ,
and on top of that , he doesn &apos;t own her .
she &apos;s his sister .
but this isn &apos;t about his relationship with his sister .
it &apos;s about his relationship with you .
you made him a promise .
yeah , and as long as he doesn &apos;t find out i broke it ,
it doesn &apos;t matter .
and in light of the story you told me the other day ,
that &apos;s probably what someone you know very well said to herself .
are you shitting me ? you &apos;re comparing me to her ?
i most certainly am .
right down to you putting donna in a position
not to say anything .
donna is not an eight @-@ year @-@ old boy ,
and i &apos;m not cheating on my wife .
no , but you &apos;re putting two people you care about
in positions to feel betrayed .
betrayed ?
yes .
like when someone has an affair with someone else .
okay--you don &apos;t get to say that to me .
it &apos;s my job to say things like that to you .
then you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
because i &apos;ve lived my whole life
not to be her .
and when people do that ,
they very often become that very thing in a different way .
well , i &apos;m not goddamn her !
well , then , you better take a look in the mirror .
because you made a promise , snuck behind someone &apos;s back
to break it , and when confronted with that fact ,
you &apos;re denying all responsibility .
that sounds like an affair to me .
you wanted to see me ?
do you know how hard i worked to get a view like this ?
full scholarship to vassar .
three years harvard law ,
and one year as the first black woman
to clerk in the third circuit .
and i &apos;m not going to waste all that hard work
just to let someone take everything away .
jessica , as far as i can tell ,
jack soloff is holding up his end of the bargain .
he &apos;s doing more than that . he just sent out an email
nominating you for junior partner .
and you &apos;re gonna figure out a way to turn it down .
what ?
go ahead , take a minute .
congratulations . you &apos;ve earned it .
you are the best associate i have ever seen .
now , these are your options .
medical issues . family emergency .
you &apos;re just not ready .
whatever it is , you simply cannot accept
a junior partnership at this time .
jessica , no one turns down partner .
well , they do now .
because i &apos;m not sending out a press release
announcing mike ross of harvard just got promoted .
then don &apos;t send one out .
you &apos;re not hearing me .
no , you &apos;re not hearing me .
what do you think is gonna happen
when word gets out that i was offered the one thing
that every associate dreams of , and i turned it down ?
nothing &apos;s going to happen .
because you &apos;re going to put your mind
to finding a good reason with as much enthusiasm as you did
bullshitting your way into this job
in the first place .
what is this ?
you know what it is .
portfolio of business i want you to take
to pearson specter for me .
i &apos;m not doing it .
this is an opportunity for you , jack .
no , daniel , it &apos;s an opportunity for you ,
and i &apos;m not interested in carrying your water .
am i mistaken , or did we not have this discussion ?
we discussed it ... once .
i remember .
it was during that same conversation we had
when you came to me for advice on the best way
to stab harvey in the back .
i get it . you did me a favor .
but i &apos;m finished .
i don &apos;t want your advice or your shortcuts anymore ,
because all it did was almost get me fired .
so please ... just take this .
ah , you &apos;ve always been a grinder , jack .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i admire it .
but you &apos;re not just a grinder .
you have a chip on your shoulder .
and the thing i &apos;ve noticed
about people with chips on their shoulder
is that somewhere along the way
they went to great lengths to get &apos; em off .
i got the chip off my shoulder .
i got jessica &apos;s respect .
she doesn &apos;t respect you .
and that &apos;s not the chip i &apos;m talking about .
don &apos;t call me again .
esther , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m actually going out to dinner with louis and donna .
well , thanks for the invitation ,
but that &apos;s the last thing in the world i want to do right now .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i was thinking about what you said
about why i called you first
and then about how you handled it .
and i thought ...
maybe you might want to take me out this weekend .
esther , what do you think &apos;s going on between us ?
i don &apos;t know , i just--
you don &apos;t know ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you . we had a moment .
it was nice , but i &apos;m not interested in sneaking around .
who said anything about sneaking around ?
i did . and you just got divorced .
and you &apos;re a mother of two ,
and i &apos;m not gonna be the reason that--
that what ?
that nothing .
why don &apos;t you just go out to your dinner ?
harvey , tell me what &apos;s going on .
what &apos;s going on is , you asked me out and i said no ,
so please just leave me alone .
harvey--
i said leave me alone .
did you make the reservation at sarabeth &apos;s ?
for the seventh time , yes .
and why was it so important that it be there anyway ?
because their muffins are ten times better than esther &apos;s ,
and i just want her to know it .
i thought you two made progress .
she &apos;s still my sister .
and i can &apos;t let her think that she &apos;s the best at something .
okay .
wait--what &apos;s wrong ? you look upset .
nothing &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m just not feeling very well .
it looks like tonight &apos;s not a good night after all .
no , no , no , you &apos;re upset .
it &apos;s not that , louis .
i just don &apos;t feel well .
please , let &apos;s just reschedule .
i &apos;m gonna just call the restaurant and--
wait a second , wait a second , wait a second .
she came all the way down here just to cancel ?
i don &apos;t know , louis , i mean , maybe she was
already on her way over here and--
did she just come from harvey &apos;s office ?
because that &apos;s the direction she came from ,
not the elevators .
i don &apos;t know , louis . what do you want me to say ?
&quot; i don &apos;t know &quot;
is exactly what you said
when i asked you if you thought
there was anything going on between harvey and esther ,
and now you &apos;re saying it again .
but you &apos;re donna , and you know everything .
i &apos;m sorry , louis . i do know .
what are you gonna do ?
none of your business .
stay out of it . you &apos;ve done enough .
you and i are gonna have a talk right now .
hey , whatever it is ... it can wait .
i need to tell you something .
does it have something to do with why my sister
just left here too upset to go out to dinner ?
you piece of shit . i knew it .
what &apos;d you do to her now ?
i didn &apos;t do anything to her , louis .
and when i say now ,
i mean as opposed to before when you slept with her .
that &apos;s right--donna , the one you tried to steal from me
at dinner the other night told me--
calm down , i didn &apos;t try to steal any--
you made a promise to me !
and even after i told you
about when esther and i were kids
and the boys used me to get to her ,
you still went ahead and betrayed me .
louis , it had already happened ,
and i was just now about to tell you .
bullshit ! you were never gonna tell me .
you were gonna keep it to yourself
till the day you died .
louis , you have to believe me .
i swear i was just about to tell you .
what you &apos;re about to do is get your ass kicked .
all right , watch yourself .
don &apos;t threaten something you can &apos;t handle .
you don &apos;t think i can handle you ?
you also thought i was too stupid to find out ,
but i did find out .
i found out that you &apos;re nothing but a lying , cheating--
i did not cheat with esther .
it was two grown people
making a goddamn decision for themselves .
well , that decision ended
with her walking out of here near tears
because she didn &apos;t have all the facts ,
like the fact that you &apos;re a serial womanizer
who can &apos;t stand when anyone else
has anything .
shut the hell up !
so he takes whatever woman &apos;s in sight ...
i &apos;m telling you .
because he &apos;s so messed up
from whatever goddamn thing happened to him
in his pathetic childhood ...
shut the hell up !
he can &apos;t--
harvey .
get away from me .
you get the hell out of here .
