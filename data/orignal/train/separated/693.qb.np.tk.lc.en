my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death ...
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
you must go now .
conrad is a ruthless man . you are not safe .
i shouldn &apos;t have chosen victoria over you .
lydia davis found a photo of a grayson party .
i was in the background .
pre @-@ emily thorne / amanda clarke .
emily announced that she &apos;s with child .
i &apos;m thrilled .
she &apos;s lying .
emily &apos;s having my baby . i &apos;m sorry .
good @-@ bye , danny .
i &apos;ll slip it back into victoria &apos;s closet
before she ever knows about it .
once it &apos;s covered in gunshot residue .
your wedding is tomorrow . i won &apos;t be in attendance .
i &apos;m sorry .
while i admire your determination , ems ,
shouldn &apos;t getting victoria to your wedding today
be your sole focus right now ?
i &apos;ve come too far to let her win .
i &apos;ll be damned if she robs me my wedding day .
you know , there are more direct ways
of dealing with this problem .
she &apos;s not getting off that easy .
well , i hate to say it ,
but her cold feet have put yours to the fire .
what are your options ?
i have a plan .
and what &apos;s that ?
proving that blood ...
is the most powerful thing of all .
shouldn &apos;t you be getting ready ?
to do what exactly , my dear ?
finally go down for the david clarke frame @-@ up ?
yeah , this list worked its way free from your bag
while you were busy faking affection for me .
it &apos;s not what you think .
i think i &apos;ve been played a fool by you and your wiles .
it &apos;s obviously my greatest weakness .
you &apos;re the beneficiary of ms. lemarchal &apos;s patronage ,
are you not ?
i was .
but i @-@ i ...
i told her i wouldn &apos;t work with her anymore .
well , nonetheless , this house has hit its quotient
for vindictive harpies .
you &apos;re more than welcome to resume slinging drinks
at whatever backwater berg will have you .
please , conrad .
i admit that when i returned , i wanted payback ,
but i just couldn &apos;t go through with it .
get out .
需要马上聊聊
i gather from the tenor of your text
that all is not well this morning ?
victoria isn &apos;t attending the wedding .
why is it the women in my life
never cease to surprise and disappoint ?
i know that she and i have had our differences ,
but to miss her son &apos;s wedding ?
well , you and your union have my full support , emily .
good ...
because i already have no family .
and i &apos;m sure their absence is amplified
on a day such as this .
so please don &apos;t think me presumptuous
when i hope that you might find me as ...
adequate recompense .
i do , conrad .
and i know my father would share my feelings for you
if he was still alive .
and perhaps he would &apos;ve had some ...
fresh insight on how to deal with victoria .
but sadly , you are stuck with a man who has very little sway
over his wife .
then i guess this will be ...
the first of many things that victoria misses .
the birth , the christening ...
her grandchild &apos;s whole life .
if only patrick hadn &apos;t left .
why ?
because he reminded her of the pain her absence can cause .
maybe his presence would &apos;ve changed her mind .
i guess he &apos;s gone .
so victoria &apos;s attendance means that much to you ?
i just want this day to be perfect ,
from start to finish .
here .
shouldn &apos;t you be getting ready ?
tux takes 10 minutes to get on ,
12 depending on the cufflinks .
since our future &apos;s riding on this issue ,
i figured i &apos;d pop by .
go . you &apos;re making us all nervous .
heard you were here .
i was--
giving an interview for the article on your cake .
i know . how &apos;d it go ?
good .
said nice things about you . i think i even meant them .
it &apos;d be much easier if you hated me right now .
and i would
if i hadn &apos;t just booked two more gigs .
guess your master plan worked , huh ?
mm @-@ hmm .
listen , i want you to know--
enough , danny .
i know you &apos;re used to getting your way ,
but you can &apos;t make everything okay for everyone .
life doesn &apos;t work like that , even for you .
congrats again .
of course , carrie .
we have a 3 : 00 tea time ,
which will allow for cocktails at sunset .
i &apos;ll see you then .
mom ?
oh ! patrick !
oh , my god !
are you okay ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
are you ?
while you were sly to exile him to the nearest island ,
did you not think i &apos;d come to know he was in manhattan ?
you stay away from my son .
i was hoping to use dear patrick as incentive
to change your mind about attending daniel &apos;s wedding .
i can &apos;t imagine why you would care .
oh , wait . let me guess-- emily put you up to it .
well , she and i both agreed
that your absence shouldn &apos;t become today &apos;s focus .
so i &apos;m going to quash my understandable resistance
to embrace one son of yours
if you &apos;re willing to muster the love to support the other .
if you think i &apos;m going to be blackmailed
by a collusion with that--
they &apos;re right , mom .
you worked so hard to repair our relationship .
i wanted to do the same for daniel .
and that &apos;s why i came when conrad reached out .
when conrad reaches out ,
beware of what &apos;s in his hand .
i approach with open palm , victoria ,
hoping to leave our grievances in the past .
if anything should happen to patrick ,
understand this , conrad--
they will be wiping what &apos;s left of you up with a sponge .
i &apos;ll have a tuxedo sent ...
assuming we have a deal that you will attend
all wedding @-@ related festivities .
say &quot; yes , &quot; mom .
for the family .
your family .
okay , let &apos;s go over this one last time .
before you board the grayson yacht ,
i &apos;m gonna sneak on side
and preset the gun we bought in victoria &apos;s name .
then i will hide out and wait until exactly 10 past 9 : 00,
when you should be approaching the buoy .
at which point ,
you will premiere the grayson family slide show ,
which i nauseatingly prepared .
when everyone &apos;s watching ,
i &apos;ll make sure victoria leaves .
then i &apos;ll make sure she &apos;s trapped ,
then await the sound of gunshots .
and i &apos;ll only fire once i &apos;ve poured my blood on deck
as evidence that she shot me .
once you &apos;ve jumped overboard ,
i &apos;ll release victoria &apos;s door , ensuring her lack of alibi .
now you have exactly 20 minutes
until the coast guard starts the search .
retrieve the case from the buoy ,
use the mini scuba tank to get beneath the surface ,
catch the current , and meet me at the beach .
then finally , with means , motive ,
gunshot residue on her bracelet , and no alibi ,
victoria grayson will be under arrest for my murder .
and under questioning , i guarantee
that she &apos;ll roll on conrad in an attempt to save herself .
let &apos;s take down the graysons once and for all .
you came to say good @-@ bye ?
since you &apos;re not coming to the wedding ... yeah , jack , i am .
look , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m sure you got a million things to do ,
and i &apos;m not much for good @-@ byes , so ...
jack ...
there &apos;s one more thing i wanted to tell you before i go .
about amanda .
i was with her when she died .
what ?
i was able to get you off the boat .
but by the time i made it back ...
i couldn &apos;t save her .
i held her in my arms , jack .
and the last thing that she made me promise
was that i would take care of you and carl .
and you &apos;re just now saying this ?
why wait till now ?
i know it &apos;s because you were
just too busy protecting your plan .
which i changed because you asked me to ,
because there was a time , jack , when you were my best friend .
but look at what you &apos;ve become
and who you &apos;re turning me into .
you are so selfish .
you use everyone who cares about you .
i lost amanda , too .
you &apos;ve taken everything from me !
even this moment .
this good @-@ bye .
i know amanda deserved better from me .
i just hope that one day ,
you can understand why i needed to do this .
good @-@ bye , jack .
you did well playing contrite for conrad .
well , i meant what i said ,
about bringing the family back together .
i know you did .
thank you .
but the idea of you apologizing to that man is nauseating .
well , it got me through the door , right ?
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
i think you &apos;re the only person who &apos;ll get me through today .
okay .
of course , i--
i wonder what that tarantula has up his many sleeves .
we have to be ready to strike first .
i can &apos;t go down that road again .
nor would i want you to .
we &apos;ll find more creative ways of dealing with conrad .
i don &apos;t think i could ever bear the thought of losing you again .
you have nothing to worry about , mom .
news travels fast .
i got your text .
um , actually got all 40 of &apos; em
over the past month .
with a zero percent response rate .
you really know how to make a guy feel special .
patrick , i spent a lot of time
wondering what the hell happened .
i ...
about disappearing-- nolan , i &apos;m sorry .
there were reasons it was time for me to leave the hamptons .
it &apos;s a good thing that i , uh ...
like reunions .
nolan , i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
and i @-@ i @-@ i know i &apos;m the one that said
we shouldn &apos;t care what other people think ,
but things have changed .
my mom really needs me right now , so i ...
yeah , but i &apos;m not ...
asking you to make a choice .
look , go to the wedding with her .
spend the after party with me .
sorry .
it &apos;s for the best .
i know . bugging the bride on her wedding day--bad form .
but i thought we should talk .
i honestly don &apos;t have time for this right now .
oh , funny that you should say that ,
because there &apos;s nothing honest about you ,
and i can finally prove it .
here &apos;s the &quot; after . &quot;
clearly not you .
ready for the &quot; before &quot; ?
and there you are , emily .
looks just like you ,
but with a billion fewer dollars .
what do you want , lydia ?
for starters , i want my house back .
it helped being next door to land a grayson ,
didn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s yours .
just please ,
don &apos;t ruin my wedding day .
leave the door unlocked .
it &apos;ll make it easier for me to move back in .
mm . i &apos;m sure that smile would be genuine
if lydia was draped over your arm .
i heard about your slumber party last night .
oh , that was a momentary lapse of reason--
not unlike our last approach to the altar .
mrs. grayson , how does it feel
adding a new member to your family ?
oh , i couldn &apos;t be happier .
patrick is a gentleman
and the light of my life .
i think he meant emily .
is your son excited ? is your son excited ?
of course he did .
i &apos;ve always put faith in my son daniel &apos;s heart .
and today , we shall see where it lies .
charlotte , you look beautiful .
me ?
you &apos;re already glowing .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna be an aunt again .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be a little girl .
and just think , she and carl will grow up together ,
play on the beach .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be best friends .
sounds wonderful .
i &apos;m gonna go check and make sure my folks are here
and give you some time alone .
charlotte ...
i love you .
i love you , too ,
my almost sister .
you look beautiful .
though i imagine my admiring gaze isn &apos;t why you summoned me .
lydia has evidence that could ruin me .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
thanks .
just getting to see you so lovely is ...
it &apos;s worth the risk of being here .
rohan did an exemplary job ,
though it &apos;s likely a wasted effort
as there should be no reason to activate this emergency beacon .
may i ?
after our rocket start ,
who would thought we &apos;d end up here ?
truthfully , i did .
hoped , at least .
only you
could make vengeance so beautiful .
stay back .
let &apos;s do it .
... the social event of the season .
we are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage
of emily rebecca thorne
and daniel edward grayson .
if anyone has reason to object to their blessed union ,
please speak now or forever hold your peace .
i don &apos;t recall
seeing your name on the guest list .
who the hell are you ?
a friend of the bride
who &apos;s been authorized to initiate the transfer
of the beach cottage &apos;s ownership--
a deal that we can start now and finalize tomorrow ,
or ...
it goes away if you go anywhere near that church .
with this ring , i commit to you ,
to our child ,
and our future together .
i love you , emily ,
now and always .
daniel ...
i &apos;ve looked forward to this day since i was a little girl .
thank you for letting me into your life ,
into your family .
daddy !
through you ,
i have become the woman that i &apos;ve always wanted to be .
the woman that i needed to be .
from the moment i met you ,
i knew that this moment was in our destiny .
we share a bond that is unbreakable ...
until death parts us .
by the powers vested in me by god
and the state of new york ,
i pronounce you man and wife .
you may now kiss your bride .
ladies and gentlemen ,
it is my great honor to present to you
daniel and emily grayson .
you &apos;ve been quiet ever since we left the church .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s our big day , and here i am , stressing about work .
is that why you &apos;re drinking for the both of us ?
well , my dad opened ... a 64 @-@ year @-@ old bottle of glenlivet .
grayson groom tradition .
well , maybe you should slow down a bit .
we still have a boat ride to nantucket ahead .
you , uh , have her for a lifetime .
you mind if i borrow her for 16 eight counts ?
well , she &apos;s all yours .
i hate to say it .
you two do make a beautiful couple .
and it &apos;s such a shame
the bride only has a few hours to live .
did you handle the patrick situation ?
he shut me down ,
in favor of staying glued to mommy drearest &apos;s side .
which is exactly why he can &apos;t get on that yacht .
he won &apos;t .
trust me .
i do ,
with my life .
so ...
i guess this is it .
long live david clarke .
no , we need more intimate shots .
i want the readers to feel like they were here . okay ?
sure .
hands @-@ on , right down to the last detail .
such dedication for an editor .
and a beat reporter , too , i hear ?
chasing specious conspiracy theories .
don &apos;t make an enemy of me , ms. lemarchal
or what ?
you &apos;ll destroy me like you destroyed so many others ?
oh , no , you see , such flagrant inaccuracies of my character .
but then , your source is a ...
disgruntled ex @-@ mistress with a history of head trauma .
yet , you are so concerned .
ah , rest assured , lydia is no threat .
one romantic rendez @-@ vous with you
and she was useless to me .
is that so ?
her allegiance is clear .
as twisted as it seems , she loves you .
this is sara . leave a message .
it &apos;s me .
maybe we ... we ...
daniel ?
you okay ?
house manager in nantucket needed to ...
confirm a surprise i &apos;m planning for em .
well , it &apos;s time to cut the cake .
let &apos;s cut the cake .
father / daughter shot .
thank you . gorgeous .
daniel hasn &apos;t uttered a word to me all day .
well , give him some time .
at least he looks happy .
emily &apos;s been kind .
well , that &apos;s how i know she &apos;s up to something .
a word of advice--
be the perfect in @-@ law , perfect grandmother .
and then when your suspicions are proven true ...
don &apos;t say &quot; i told you so . &quot;
我知道保罗神父的真面目
is everything okay ?
excuse me .
sara made a beautiful cake .
you don &apos;t have to say that .
i understand what it is to want closure .
i know you do things you never thought you would do .
i swear ,
i &apos;m gonna be a better man to you ,
and an even better dad to our baby .
excuse me .
have you come to kick me out of this suite , too ?
i have not .
then what , conrad ?
lydia , i am a titan of industry ,
master of the damned universe .
i have the right family ,
the right connections ,
and the wrong woman by my side .
i planned to remedy that
when i fell in love with you years ago--
a feeling that was recently reignited ...
and promptly ... extinguished when i found your journal .
conrad , i ...
shh . let me finish .
i &apos;ve always had a weakness for you
because you &apos;re the only woman to see the guilt and the pain ,
the ...
the good ... and the bad .
i &apos;m not a simple man to be with ,
but i have a simple question .
do you love me ?
yes .
then i want you to have the life i promised years ago ,
with me .
and maybe it &apos;s time we shake things up in the hamptons .
let &apos;s .
emily told me
you almost didn &apos;t attend the ceremony .
what changed your mind ?
love for my son .
well , i assume you mean patrick .
your brother &apos;s presence made this day bearable ,
but i came because i wanted to salvage our relationship ,
for everyone &apos;s sake .
well , that &apos;s easy .
you can ... accept emily , accept that we &apos;re having a baby ,
and we &apos;re happy .
yet , you &apos;re obviously self @-@ medicating .
daniel , you don &apos;t look happy .
you look trapped .
where &apos;s patrick ?
i hope he &apos;ll be joining us on the yacht .
he went to the city to pick up a few things .
but he &apos;ll be arriving in nantucket tomorrow .
good .
i do want this to be
a weekend the whole family can remember .
okay , last looks for hair and makeup .
we have a few shots here at the house
and several more combinations as you board .
sorry i &apos;m a bit late ,
but , um ...
well , i guess now &apos;s the time to tell you all that
i &apos;ve invited someone to join us on our family sojourn .
and my guest has flawless skin .
no touch @-@ up needed .
conrad .
lydia and i don &apos;t exactly get along .
oh . well , it may be your honeymoon , sweetheart ,
but it &apos;s still my yacht .
and mine .
vacationing with your harlot is where i draw the line .
need i remind you of our deal , victoria ?
if you want me to welcome patrick back into the fold ,
you &apos;ll do the same for my companion .
you duplicitous--
victoria .
don &apos;t give him the satisfaction .
my associate said we had a deal .
right . the beach house .
what more do you want , lydia ?
i want you to get exactly what &apos;s coming to you .
all eyes were on the hamptons today
for the most anticipated wedding of the year ,
as socialite emily thorne
and budding media mogul daniel grayson ...
wed in a ceremony on ...
don &apos;t worry , boss .
i &apos;m off the clock and a paying customer .
they &apos;ve been playing
this &quot; happily ever after &quot; crap on loop .
what about the cake ? that &apos;s the real story .
well , this must be some great p.r. for you .
that &apos;s gotta be a reason to celebrate .
it &apos;s not that kinda night .
it &apos;s the kinda night you get wasted and think about
how you fell in love with your ex @-@ boyfriend
weeks before his wedding ,
and how you keep replaying his stupid voice mail he left
at his frickin &apos; wedding reception .
daniel ?
yeah .
and he let me think there was a chance .
i saw danny this morning .
he didn &apos;t ask me , but ...
i know he wanted me to forgive him .
i didn &apos;t because ...
once i do--
it &apos;s over for good .
dumb as hell , right ?
come on .
you &apos;re not gonna tell a stupid girl
she &apos;s being stupid ?
well , you know , that kind of attitude
just might get you laid tonight , mr. porter .
how about i call you a cab ?
thought my text would get your attention .
what do you think you know ?
when i heard about the sabotage to conrad &apos;s brakes ,
i did what i &apos;ve been doing since i was 14 months old--
put two and two together .
i know it was you that caused the crash .
what is this ? a threat ?
no .
i &apos;ve known about this for weeks .
i haven &apos;t told a soul .
the only reason that i brought up what you did
was to bring you back .
patrick ...
you &apos;re safe ,
in a way that you never were at grayson manor .
you know , victoria told me about
how conrad kept her prisoner in that marriage for years .
that man killed her spirit .
he did just a little bit , you know , every day .
so i did something that i regret like hell .
i &apos;m sure you can &apos;t possibly understand that .
i fight for the people that i love , too .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ...
right now .
i can &apos;t just let that go .
can i get everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
i know that many of you thought a family honeymoon
was ... odd , to say the least .
but ...
i want this marriage
to be about family--
past , present ,
and future .
i &apos;ve been keeping a little secret from you all ,
even daniel .
i put together a video of
some of our grayson celebrations over the past couple of years .
i wanted to screen it for you all now .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s cider .
to ties that bind us .
cheers .
to family .
cheers .
to family .
cheers .
oh , my gosh ! i &apos;m so sorry !
i &apos;ll take care of it in the stateroom .
hello ?
what are you talking about ?
daniel ?
that was sara &apos;s roommate .
daniel , what is it ?
sara tried to kill herself .
i am so sorry .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
victoria , wait .
have you come to help ?
mm . well , i didn &apos;t even think to ask if you had club soda
for this spill , since most bartenders do .
i &apos;m done making mai tais .
conrad &apos;s promised me a penthouse .
if you &apos;re referring to that sad little pied @-@ à @-@ terre
where he entertains his mistresses ,
i &apos;d wash the sheets first .
you don &apos;t love him , victoria ,
so i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going on about .
besides , we both know you have far bigger concerns than me .
and they say no one ever thinks about the mother of the groom .
i thought i &apos;d bring you a real drink ,
since i suspect you &apos;re about as pregnant as i am .
this photo proves that
you &apos;ve been targeting my family and my son for years .
now who are you ?
as of five hours ago ,
i &apos;m emily grayson .
you &apos;re trying to bait me .
you &apos;d like nothing more than for me to grab you by the throat
so that you can say that i &apos;m crazy .
you know , for once ,
you &apos;re not completely mad , victoria .
daniel needed a little last @-@ minute incentive ,
so i stole from the master manipulator .
after all , isn &apos;t a fake pregnancy how you landed conrad ?
well , the difference is that i believed i loved him .
but you &apos;re nothing but a predator .
an empty shell who seeks to wreak havoc .
that &apos;s it .
do you even hear yourself , victoria ?
what a sad , sad woman .
to care about what you think , emily ,
i would have to feel something for you .
you are as worthless to me
as this bracelet .
go on .
go after it ,
before the other bottom @-@ feeders beat you to it .
good @-@ bye , victoria .
two minutes and then fire .
i heard everything .
daniel .
what , you gonna shoot me ?
no .
you set me up .
two years !
two years ,
and i bet you laughed at me every time i questioned you .
and you just fed me more of your lies .
and why ? !
why did you tell me i was gonna be a father ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
captain , man overboard !
all hands on deck !
bring her about !
off the starboard !
all right ! starboard engine full throttle !
what the devil happened ?
oh , my god .
where &apos;s emily ?
where &apos;s victoria ?
i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m gonna shower .
why don &apos;t you
put on some music and , uh , come join me ?
okay .
i mean , dude .
you ever hear of a universal remote ?
what are you doing here ?
don &apos;t worry .
i just wanna end things right with her .
emily left this for me , but i think she should have it .
it was amanda &apos;s .
she &apos;s not here ?
what do you mean ?
she should have beat me to the beach ten minutes ago .
the distress beacon has not been activated .
then where the hell is she ?
oh , god .
emily ?
emily !
emily !
emily !
emily !
