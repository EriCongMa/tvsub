you took this case without running it by me .
jessica--
that &apos;s enough . dump it .
or i will .
you think this case is a winner ?
i do .
then what do you say we do it together ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna end up hating each other .
if i &apos;m lucky , i &apos;m gonna fight with him about a lot of things .
why not start with a fight where we &apos;re both on the same side ?
this is harvey &apos;s last three income statements ,
and i found them sitting in the copy machine .
you came to work for me .
you knew who i was when you did ,
so now it &apos;s time for you to decide .
are you with me or not ?
you always said , once you pick a side ,
if you &apos;re not loyal to that side ,
then who the hell are you ?
you should &apos;ve thought of that before you picked someone
who would do something like this in the first place .
you ever take sides with jack soloff against me again ,
i will bury you .
well , you look happy .
becky just tell susie she like @-@ likes you ?
eh , more like kelton insurance just told robert zane
they &apos;re scared @-@ scared of us .
you got a settlement offer ?
just like he said we would .
i got to hand it to him , he played them perfectly .
did he now ?
what ?
nothing .
look , i take it back about becky .
the only one with a crush around here is you .
sounds like someone &apos;s worried that robert zane
might be better than him .
nice try , tiger , but did magic ever worry about bird ?
first of all , yes , he did .
second of all , you realize
you &apos;re the white guy in this scenario , right ?
i know i &apos;m the bigger badass in every scenario .
okay , mr. badass , which one are you , magic or bird ?
i think we both know i &apos;m ...
jordan .
hey , why don &apos;t you go meet your boyfriend robert zane ?
i think i just left something at security .
oh . look who like @-@ likes someone now .
ma &apos;am , the last time i let someone up
that he wasn &apos;t expecting ,
he threatened to have me executed .
i &apos;m sure he did , but i &apos;m telling you that--
that gretchen obviously forgot to phone down , carl ,
because we have a meeting scheduled for right now .
that isn &apos;t what she just--
carl .
a meeting with you . really ?
i promise i &apos;m much better @-@ looking
than whoever you were supposed to meet .
you have no idea how right you are .
but i could have sworn you were just on your way out .
oh , that &apos;s not a problem .
the mayor can wait .
but i &apos;m not sure the governor can .
are you trying to out @-@ name @-@ drop me ?
if i were , i think i just did .
but i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret .
i don &apos;t really care about names that much .
well , if you don &apos;t care about names ,
why don &apos;t we skip the introductions
and just get down to breakfast ?
what if i already had breakfast ?
i &apos;m talking about tomorrow morning , in my kitchen .
or yours , i mean , you look like you have a nice place .
as tempting as that is , maybe another time .
good luck in your meeting .
so how &apos;s my favorite pain @-@ in @-@ the @-@ ass lawyer ?
i thought louis was your favorite pain @-@ in @-@ the @-@ ass lawyer .
he is , but louis isn &apos;t responsible
for me getting to work on this .
you &apos;re doing the grunt work on our case ?
i pulled some strings , thought it might give us
a chance to work together .
you know i &apos;m engaged , right ?
yes , mike , that &apos;s my plan ,
to steal you from my boss &apos;s daughter .
it &apos;s a thing . it &apos;s been done .
well , i didn &apos;t come here to steal you .
i came here to thank you .
for what ?
come on , mike .
i get fired , and two days later ,
i get an offer from rachel &apos;s father ?
whatever you did , i owe you one .
actually , you owe rachel one .
no shit .
shit .
shiiit .
by the way , you &apos;re in the wrong conference room .
okay , esther , what are you doing here ?
what , a woman can &apos;t stop by
to see her brother , who she loves ?
please , you know damn well we don &apos;t love each other .
in that case , i need a lawyer .
you ? for what ?
did you give someone salmonella with your stupid muffins ?
i &apos;m getting a divorce .
well , good .
i knew that guy was dead weight the second i met him .
i know , i think that was your speech at our wedding .
and your sympathy is touching ,
but i didn &apos;t come here to vindicate you .
no , i know you didn &apos;t .
you came to get me
to slaughter jeffrey for you , and i will .
when i &apos;m done with him , he won &apos;t have a pot to shit in .
it &apos;s &quot; piss in . &quot;
and , louis , i don &apos;t want you to slaughter jeffrey .
why the hell not ?
because i want harvey specter to .
come again ?
you said he was the best attorney in the city .
no , esther , i told you he was my best friend .
which is exactly what you said
about jeremy henschell in tenth grade ,
which really meant
you worshipped him from afar ,
you wrote in your diary about him ,
and you never actually hung out .
okay , you swore you never read my diary .
and you swore you didn &apos;t spy on me and jeremy .
oh , please , that was one time .
i was on my way to get a glass of milk .
and for your information ,
i &apos;ve been lactose intolerant ever since .
louis , are you gonna get me harvey ,
or do i have to get him myself ?
harvey is not taking on any new clients right now ,
and he &apos;s out of town for the next few years .
louis , i know what you &apos;re doing .
you think i want harvey
because i don &apos;t think you &apos;re good enough .
you &apos;re wrong .
i know how good you are .
but this is personal for me ,
which means it will be personal for you ,
and i can &apos;t have that .
so please , will you get me harvey ?
i &apos;ll make it happen .
thank you , louis .
that was esther ?
yes , i know what you &apos;re gonna say--
we look exactly alike .
that actually wasn &apos;t ...
i get it--it &apos;s like looking at me in a wig .
i &apos;ve heard it a thousand times .
yeah , the resemblance is uncanny .
what ?
i &apos;m just wondering why you &apos;re not getting up to go ask harvey .
because i &apos;m not gonna ask him .
i &apos;m gonna save some time and tell her he said no .
louis--
donna ,
we all know that harvey &apos;s furious at me .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s gonna do it .
maybe not .
but , louis , she &apos;s family ,
and if there &apos;s one thing that harvey understands ,
it &apos;s that .
where the hell have you been ?
sorry , i got stuck in really bad traffic .
so you were in the wrong conference room .
for about 20 minutes .
so what did we get ?
want to take a guess ?
$ 90 million .
want to take a real guess ?
that was a real guess .
son , what planet are you living on ?
the planet where you called
to say we got a great settlement .
$ 25 million is a great settlement .
$ 25 million ?
robert , after fees ,
that &apos;s less than $ 70,000 per person .
then what do you suggest we counter with ?
i suggest we counter with a trial .
are you nuts ? you don &apos;t go to trial .
you turn up the pressure , and then you settle .
going to trial is turning up the pressure .
the second we finish opening arguments ,
that offer is gonna triple .
look , i &apos;ve sat across the table from these two
four times in the last six years ,
and when they say this is their best offer ,
it &apos;s their best offer ,
and we &apos;re recommending it .
well , you can recommend whatever you want .
i &apos;m recommending we reject it .
you don &apos;t give clients conflicting opinions .
you work it out behind closed doors .
well , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
you want to do things behind closed doors .
i actually want to be honest .
hey , watch yourself , mike .
you tell me this ,
would $ 70,000 per person
be a great settlement if we were talking
about laura &apos;s life or rachel &apos;s ?
you get out of here !
you don &apos;t come back
until you wrap your head around recommending this offer .
and don &apos;t you ever use them against me again !
don &apos;t tell me he wasn &apos;t in here either .
he was in here , all right .
what happened ? did the settlement fall through ?
no , it didn &apos;t , but it should &apos;ve .
they gave us a shitty offer .
robert &apos;s ready to take it .
come on , if it &apos;s really that bad ,
why would he take it ?
because he knows his clients will jump all over it
and it &apos;s the easy way out .
so you think robert doesn &apos;t care about his clients ?
it sure seems that way .
mike , i &apos;ve only been here a few months ,
and there are a lot of things you can say about robert zane ,
but what you can &apos;t say is that
he doesn &apos;t care about his clients .
go away , louis .
i would , but then i couldn &apos;t tell you
about the $ 50 @-@ million company i &apos;m giving you .
and why would you do that ?
&apos;cause i want to make up for our little misunderstanding .
we didn &apos;t have a misunderstanding .
you went after my money ,
so if you &apos;re giving me a client ,
there &apos;s some other misunderstanding
that you &apos;re too chickenshit to tell me about .
it &apos;s my sister &apos;s company .
i &apos;ll give you her business .
all you have to do is handle her divorce .
i don &apos;t want your sister &apos;s business .
now get out .
harvey , this is my family .
my sister , she ... has never asked me for anything
her entire life , not once .
now the one time she does , i just can &apos;t let her down .
louis , i &apos;m not a divorce attorney .
when has a shitty detail like that ever stopped you before ?
all right , i &apos;ll do it , on two conditions .
first , you stay completely out of this case .
done . second ?
i &apos;ll let you know when i think of it .
how do i know it won &apos;t be something i can &apos;t stomach ?
you don &apos;t , but those are my two conditions .
okay , harvey , you have a deal .
one thing .
promise me you won &apos;t sleep with esther .
believe me , louis , the last thing i want to do
is sleep with your sister .
i &apos;m glad you agree .
i &apos;ll let you know when the paperwork &apos;s finished .
i know you didn &apos;t wrap your head
around this deal in the last ten minutes ,
so what are you still doing in my office ?
exactly what you &apos;d be doing in my place .
robert , i know you said that you know these two lawyers ,
but i don &apos;t .
i need to see for myself what they will or won &apos;t do .
and you still want to counter .
i want to at least try .
except you don &apos;t want to go by yourself ,
you want me to go with you .
yes , i do .
because you and i both know , if we don &apos;t go together ,
we don &apos;t stand a chance .
i know we don &apos;t stand a chance either way .
and if i do go , it makes me look like a fool .
robert , i saved you from looking like a fool in that courtroom .
i came through for you .
now i &apos;m asking you to come through for me on this .
you and rachel are peas in a pod .
can &apos;t believe she &apos;s really worth $ 50 million .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve never heard of her company .
do i look like i buy a lot of potholders ?
she doesn &apos;t just sell potholders .
she has a brand like martha stewart .
look , i get that you think she &apos;s impressive ,
but to me , she &apos;s just louis &apos;s sister ,
which , as far as i &apos;m concerned , is strike number two .
what &apos;s strike number one ?
the fact that she &apos;s louis &apos;s sister .
oh , come on , harvey , listen .
are you gonna take this seriously or not ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna go walk there .
i &apos;m gonna shake this woman &apos;s meaty hand .
i &apos;m gonna get this over with as quickly as possible .
you ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you two know each other ?
so you weren &apos;t meeting the governor .
you &apos;re telling me you were really gonna blow off the mayor ?
the mayor . you don &apos;t know the mayor .
i &apos;m so sorry ,
let me introduce my soon @-@ to @-@ be former associate .
rachel zane .
esther edelstein .
it &apos;s nice to finally meet the man
i &apos;ve heard such good things about .
it &apos;s nice to meet the woman
i &apos;ve obviously heard nothing but lies about .
let &apos;s get to it .
yes .
i just have to know ,
were one of the two of you adopted ?
i &apos;ve been asking that for years .
hey . get out .
shit .
come on , speak up , narcissist , it &apos;s not a freakin &apos; library .
reminder to thin the walls
in the conference room / make a peephole .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what happened ?
oh , i was just checking the sound @-@ proofing ,
making sure they thicken the walls in the conference room .
so if i walk out this door and i turn to the right ,
i won &apos;t see harvey in there with esther ?
esther &apos;s here ? i didn &apos;t know that .
louis , listening through the wall
is not staying out of her case ,
and if harvey finds out , he &apos;s gonna drop her .
look , it &apos;s my sister , all right ?
i just want to make sure he does right by her .
and you never would have asked him to take this case
if you didn &apos;t trust that he would do just that .
so put the glass down , go back to your office ,
and let him do his job .
you know it &apos;d be easier for both of us
if you were wrong every once in a while .
when we decided to get divorced , jeffrey and i agreed
he would get 20 % of the company , no need to involve lawyers .
the next thing i knew , i got a letter from a lawyer .
jeffrey doesn &apos;t think 20 % is enough anymore .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
esther , i &apos;m gonna ask you a question ,
and i want you to answer me honestly .
who &apos;s leaving who ?
it &apos;s mutual .
it &apos;s never mutual .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you again . who &apos;s driving this decision ?
i am .
then the answer to our problem
is for you to stay away from the negotiations .
what ? no , i &apos;m not staying away .
listen to me .
he &apos;s going back on your deal
because he wants to prolong the fight .
i don &apos;t care .
i spent 12 years building the company .
i &apos;m not gonna sit back and let someone else decide
how much i &apos;m allowed to keep .
then what &apos;d you come to me for ?
because you &apos;re supposed to be the best .
i am the best , and i didn &apos;t get that way
letting someone else call the shots .
so you &apos;re either gonna let me do that ,
or you &apos;re gonna get yourself another lawyer .
all right , here &apos;s what i need you to do .
you can tell me what you need me to do in a minute .
first we &apos;re gonna talk about what happened back there .
what happened is , i laid down the law ,
she accepted , i &apos;m the man .
yep , uh @-@ huh .
okay , i &apos;m not talking about that .
i &apos;m talking about how the moment you walked through the door ,
you looked like you were struck by a bolt of lighting .
i did not .
you most certainly did .
in fact , before you started fighting ,
i was afraid the two of you were gonna go at it on the table .
afraid or hoping ?
that &apos;s unsavory .
and you making lewd comments about our client isn &apos;t ?
lewd comments about what client ?
harvey likes louis &apos;s sister .
that &apos;s funny , &apos; cause that &apos;s exactly what i came in here
to talk to him about .
you like louis &apos;s sister ?
not enough to fight you for her .
well , you should reconsider . she &apos;s lovely .
and i &apos;m leaving .
harvey , why are you all of a sudden
taking on esther edelstein as a client ?
and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s because she &apos;s lovely ,
because i &apos;m not sure i believe that .
i took her on because louis asked me to .
and the last i heard , you and i were both pissed at him .
and i still am .
but he told me this was family ,
and ... i thought this might be a chance
for us all to get back on track .
i like that , harvey .
you just might turn out
to be a half decent name partner after all .
i doubt it .
so do i.
well , frankly , robert , i &apos;m surprised
you called for another meeting .
surprised by a routine counter ?
when the first offer is as generous as ours , i am .
just hear the man out , will .
campbell v. state health .
wilson v. genrx .
friedman v. medfirst .
those are identical class actions
in which the average payout
was $ 1 / 2 million per plaintiff .
they were jury awards , and two of them were reduced
for being excessively punitive .
dollar amount was still higher than what &apos;s on the table .
after seven years of appeals .
yeah , and like we said , we don &apos;t care how long it takes .
we want triple what you &apos;re offering .
and i want to skinny dip with sofia vergara ,
but no puedo hacerlo .
that &apos;s spanish for &quot; we &apos;re not giving you another nickel . &quot;
and what &apos;s spanish for &quot; we &apos;ll see you in court &quot; ?
bring it on .
that &apos;s enough . come on , will .
we &apos;re just having a conversation .
conversation ?
i gave you a fair offer , robert ,
because i respect you ,
and i thought that you respected me enough to know
that i meant it when i said it &apos;s the best i could do .
then he comes in here threatening a trial .
well , you know what ?
you don &apos;t like what &apos;s on the table ,
we can pull the whole damn thing .
i told you he wasn &apos;t messing around .
you were right about that .
now i &apos;m right about taking this to trial .
you aren &apos;t right about anything .
i owed you . i paid up . we &apos;re done .
no , we &apos;re not done , and i &apos;m still not
recommending this offer to my clients .
well , that &apos;s too bad , because they already signed off .
what ?
you talked to our clients before we even went in there ?
you &apos;re damn right i did .
we took a shot , and it didn &apos;t work .
now , in the meantime , we had an obligation
to show their offer to our clients , and i did .
don &apos;t give me some bullshit justification .
you went behind my back .
i didn &apos;t go behind your back . i went over your head .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you know what the hell i &apos;m talking about .
i went to your boss &apos;s boss , and you know what ?
she and i see things the same way .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this case is settled .
why don &apos;t you two have a seat ? i suggest we get right to it .
wait a second , where &apos;s esther ?
she won &apos;t be joining us , but i &apos;ve been authorized
to negotiate on her behalf .
no . no , i &apos;m not agreeing to anything without her here .
that &apos;s because you don &apos;t really want to negotiate ,
you just want to stay connected to her ,
and that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i don &apos;t know when you decided to become a divorce attorney ,
but that &apos;s not how it works .
i didn &apos;t become a divorce attorney
because it &apos;s the minor leagues ,
but this is how it works with me .
what the hell is this ?
that &apos;s our new offer , nothing .
this is bullshit .
you thinking you deserve even 20 %
of our client &apos;s business is bullshit .
so you &apos;re either gonna accept the terms that
you and esther agreed to ,
or you can take our new offer .
you can threaten all you want ,
but my client has a right to what &apos;s his ,
and that &apos;s half the company ,
because 12 years ago , that &apos;s what your client agreed to .
see , i wasn &apos;t just gonna be esther &apos;s husband .
i was gonna be a doctor ,
but i put that on hold
while esther got her company off the ground ,
and when i said i was willing to do that ,
she said i &apos;d get half .
which constitutes an enforceable verbal contract .
so i don &apos;t care whether esther &apos;s here or not .
she promised to spend our lives together ,
and she &apos;s breaking that promise .
there &apos;s nothing i can do about that one ,
but i &apos;m sure as hell gonna hold her to the other one .
you have no proof she ever made that promise .
ask your client about it ,
because when we depose her under oath ,
you can rest assured we will .
you authorized the settlement ?
you want to change that tone ?
no , i don &apos;t , because you told robert zane
to treat me like a partner ,
and then you turned around , and you cut my legs out .
i told him that because you were my proxy ,
but you &apos;re not my proxy with me .
and i don &apos;t appreciate my decisions being questioned .
did you even look at that offer ?
mike , i &apos;m going to explain something to you
that , based on your approach to this conversation ,
you clearly don &apos;t understand .
this trial will cost millions .
and arcadian has deep pockets .
and they &apos;re not looking to empty them on a gamble .
so this is all just about the money .
were you born yesterday ?
the clients are looking for money .
we &apos;re looking for money .
the insurance company &apos;s looking to keep money .
it &apos;s always about the money .
and if you had some balls , we &apos;d get a whole lot more .
listen to me , i don &apos;t know what you thought marching in here
was going to do other than piss me off ,
but you &apos;re going to march the hell back out
because i have better things to do with my time
than to explain to you how the world works .
hey , i got your message .
jeffrey signed the agreement ?
he did .
all it needs is your john hancock .
wait , this doesn &apos;t say 20 % . it says 50 % .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , did i forget to mention
that he said you promised him 50 % of your company
for putting off medical school ?
because you sure forgot to mention that to me .
you have got to be kidding me .
how could you not tell me that ?
because it was a throwaway conversation
we had 12 years ago on the new jersey turnpike .
well , it wasn &apos;t throwaway to him , and he &apos;s gonna use it
because he &apos;s feeling betrayed .
well , i don &apos;t really care what he &apos;s feeling
because he &apos;s the one who had the affair .
you wanted to know the circumstances of our divorce .
well , that &apos;s what they are .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m leaving him .
i am sure you wouldn &apos;t understand what &apos;s it like
to experience infidelity .
i would , and i do ,
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact that you made a contract .
what about our other contract ? 20 % .
the original agreement supersedes it ,
and an affair doesn &apos;t change that .
except he doesn &apos;t have any proof
i ever made the original agreement .
esther , they &apos;re gonna put you under oath
and ask you point @-@ blank if this happened .
and i &apos;m going to say it didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s perjury , and i &apos;m not gonna let you do that .
what are you ,
some white knight who never crosses the line to win ?
no , but i &apos;m not gonna let you make a decision
in the heat of the moment
that you &apos;ll regret for the rest of your life .
well , then you better find some other way to void this deal ,
because there &apos;s no way i &apos;m giving my shit bag husband
half of everything i own .
i need you to find every loophole there is
around verbal contracts .
so jeffrey was telling the truth ?
yes , and she &apos;d rather slit her wrists
than give him 50 % , and i don &apos;t blame her .
yeah , but she &apos;s the one who &apos;s leaving him , so--
he cheated on her , didn &apos;t he ?
well , that &apos;s between our client
and her soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ husband ,
and i have no intention of letting him
get the better of her .
what ?
you &apos;re being protective . it &apos;s sweet .
okay , listen to me , we &apos;re protecting esther
because it &apos;s our job to protect her .
and if we don &apos;t figure a way out of this ,
she &apos;s gonna lose millions of dollars ,
so you want to make observations about the two of us ,
do it all you want after we &apos;ve won .
i &apos;m on it .
okay , so final deal memos here , check authorizations here .
now all we need to do is get kelton to sign , and we are done .
mike , i know you think this deal sucks ,
but there is a silver lining .
we got to work together again .
what ?
i was just thinking about when we started .
who would &apos;ve thought that working with you
would ever have been a silver lining ?
me ?
yeah , you .
what about you ?
what are you talking about ?
i have been a gentleman since day one .
really ?
yes .
remember the whole airplane incident ?
do i ? yes , you were the one who--
wait . wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait a second . delta financial .
what about them ?
there was a brochure for delta bauer financial
on robert zane &apos;s desk .
and on top of that , they were listed
as a subsidiary on arcadian &apos;s annual report .
as are 50 other funds .
50 other funds that don &apos;t have a brochure
on robert zane &apos;s desk .
mike--
katrina ,
i need to know if they &apos;re one of your clients .
you know i can &apos;t tell you that .
okay , well , you just did .
now i need to know if they own shares of kelton .
i don &apos;t know if they own shares , and i &apos;m not gonna find out .
you don &apos;t care if robert zane is manipulating a case
to service a hedge fund ?
it doesn &apos;t matter if i care .
i can &apos;t violate attorney @-@ client privilege .
you said you owe me .
and you said i owe rachel .
katrina , please .
you said that robert is doing right by his clients .
well , i just need to know which clients he &apos;s doing right by .
do you have a minute ?
the last time i asked you that , you told me the answer was no .
and i still gave you the minute .
well , i happen to be in the middle
of trying to get louis &apos;s sister out of a huge mess , so--
that &apos;s what i wanted to talk to you about .
louis promised to stay out of this .
and he is , and i &apos;m not here because he asked me to be .
i &apos;m here because i care about him and--
that &apos;s not my problem .
harvey , i &apos;m not the enemy here .
and louis is your partner and your friend ,
and right now , he needs a little reassurance .
and i told you before , i &apos;m not the guy
that gives you a hug when you &apos;re scared .
i &apos;m the guy that wins when you need it the most .
why can &apos;t you for once--
you know what , donna , when i came to you for help ,
you said that i don &apos;t get to do that anymore .
well , you don &apos;t get to do this anymore .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have work to do .
you know what , harvey ?
louis was afraid to let you take this case ,
and i told him not to be because i trusted
that at the end of the day ,
you &apos;d remember that we &apos;re family .
but maybe i was wrong .
because i spent 12 years putting you first ,
and the day i finally decided to do something for myself ,
you didn &apos;t just stop treating me like family ,
you started treating me like a stranger .
and for your information , that is a thousand times worse
than if you treated me like your enemy .
louis , did you need something ?
i need you to know how proud i am of you ,
&apos;cause seeing you working like this
just reminds me how you persevered with the lsats ,
and how you got into law school , and now--
louis , i &apos;m not telling you about esther &apos;s case .
well , then what the hell good are you ?
louis , you promised harvey you would stay out of it .
i just need to know what happened .
what happened with what ?
what happened with them .
i mean , it &apos;s no secret that i hated jeffrey ,
but esther , she loved him ,
and for them to just--
i need to know why .
he cheated on her .
well , then you promise me that the two of you ...
stick it to that sack of shit .
what do you think i &apos;m working on ?
we &apos;re all squared away on the paperwork ?
no , we &apos;re not squared away on shit
until you tell me whether or not you knew .
you want to run that by me again ?
delta financial , your client .
did you know they were heavily invested in kelton ?
are you accusing me of something , mike ?
because you better watch what you say .
you still haven &apos;t answered my question .
did you know a subsidiary of the hedge fund
backing our suit just purchased a huge block of kelton shares ?
i am their lawyer , not a stock analyst .
then maybe you can explain to me
why you have one of their brochures on your desk ?
okay , listen to me , mr. photographic memory .
underneath this brochure are another 35
that have been piling up there for a year and a half
because i &apos;m looking to invest my money
that someday may be going to your children .
wait , you think we want money that comes from some stock
that went through the roof because you authorized
a settlement lower than street expectations ?
okay , you &apos;ve said your piece . now i &apos;m gonna say mine .
i have been a lawyer and an officer of the court
longer than you &apos;ve breathed air ,
and i &apos;m looking you straight in the eye
and telling you that i am an honest man .
you know as an honest man
that now that we &apos;ve discovered this ,
we have to disclose it as conflict of interest .
then bury it , deep in the fine print ,
because it had nothing to do with my recommendation ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let it blow this goddamn deal .
since when did this become a deposition ?
it didn &apos;t , but since you seemed so anxious to ask esther
about what she said in the past ,
i thought i &apos;d just save us all the trouble
and get it on the record myself .
what ? i never agreed--
you promised jeffrey 50 % of your company , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , i did .
then it &apos;s settled .
well , not quite .
now that our client has admitted
that she made the agreement ,
we &apos;d like to discuss the circumstances
under which she did .
what do you mean the circumstances ?
she promised me 50 % , period .
no , she promised you 50 % because you forfeited
your admission to medical school .
that &apos;s right , and instead of going to stanford ,
i stayed home and took care of our family .
then why is there no record of you
ever being admitted to stanford ?
or any school , for that matter ?
just a pile of rejection letters .
you lied to me ?
this is ridiculous .
lots of people don &apos;t get into medical school
on the first try .
you were gonna take half of my company on the first try .
30 % .
he &apos;s not getting another penny
of the business i built myself .
you want to talk about doing things yourself ?
who do you think stayed home and kept our family together
while you were too busy baking muffins
to make dinner for your kids ?
don &apos;t you dare attack me as a mother !
you cheated on me !
esther , i &apos;m sorry .
i made a mistake .
but i did give up everything for you .
i put my life on hold .
i sacrificed my dream for yours .
i &apos;m never gonna get those years back .
no , jeffrey .
we had everything ,
and you ruined it .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
you have our final offer .
this better not be about robert zane again .
just give me one minute .
god damn it .
one of his clients purchased shares of kelton ,
and if they acted on privileged information--
i know the law .
well , then you know it &apos;s unethical at best
and illegal at worst .
what do you want from me ?
i want to know if you think he knew .
what the hell difference does that make ?
it &apos;s the difference between a legitimate settlement
and stock manipulation .
you mean it would make him a fraud ?
this isn &apos;t the same thing , and you know it .
i &apos;m not trying to screw over my clients .
why would you even bring that up right now ?
because you begged me for this case
and a chance to work with that man .
and if he colluded with them ,
we can stick a better settlement down their throats .
do you really think robert zane is dirty enough to do that ?
i don &apos;t know , but i find it hard to believe
that he &apos;s dumb enough not to know .
my dad &apos;s not dumb .
and he &apos;s not dirty .
rachel ...
and the last time someone called him shady ,
it was louis , and you almost punched him over it .
this is different .
this is the same .
you were gonna punch him because an attack on me
is an attack on you .
well , attack on my father is an attack on me ,
and you &apos;re the one who &apos;s doing it .
nobody &apos;s attacking anybody .
mike , you once came to me
asking me to give you the benefit of the doubt ,
and i gave it to you .
so the least you can do is give it to him .
i was hoping you had good news ,
but you &apos;re not pouring that drink because we have a deal .
we don &apos;t , but we can .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying they offered 30 % ,
and i talked them down to 25 % .
and why should i take it ?
because he &apos;s not the one dragging this fight out anymore .
you are .
and whether or not you believe
he gave up everything for you , he does .
tell me i don &apos;t have the right to be angry .
do you know why i never even considered
becoming a divorce attorney ?
because it &apos;s beneath you .
because there are children involved .
when people get caught up in divorce ...
they forget there are some things in life
that are more important than money .
okay , harvey .
25 % .
you know , you &apos;re not exactly
the harvey specter i was expecting .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
a good thing .
you &apos;re not exactly the louis &apos;s sister i was expecting .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
a good thing . definitely a good thing .
would you like to take me home tonight ?
i would .
but i need you to sign that first .
why is that ?
because then you won &apos;t be my client anymore .
a man with a code .
maybe you are a white knight after all .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
louis , it &apos;s midnight . what &apos;s--
harvey &apos;s screwing esther .
what ?
look at this .
it &apos;s an agreement that esther signed
that agrees to give jeffrey 25 % .
that &apos;s 5 % more than she needs to pay that son of a bitch .
where did you get this ?
well , i was walking down the hall .
i saw two glasses , a bottle of scotch , and that .
he got her drunk , so he could screw me over .
okay , there is no way harvey would ever do that .
you woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me that ?
donna , 5 % extra is $ 3 million .
how do you explain that ?
i can &apos;t .
i can .
he &apos;s trying to get me back about his compensation
by trying to screw over another litt .
so what i need you to do--
louis , the only thing that i need to do
is tell you you &apos;re crazy and go back to sleep .
and if you do anything between now and tomorrow
other than confront harvey face @-@ to @-@ face , so help me god ,
you will not have a secretary in the morning .
i &apos;m letting it go .
does that have something to do
with where you &apos;ve been so early in the morning ?
yeah .
you went to see my dad ?
i went to see emma powell ,
asked her how she felt about the settlement .
she said it would change her life .
you said it wasn &apos;t enough money .
she didn &apos;t even mention the money .
she said , for her , the settlement was proof
that kelton didn &apos;t do right by her husband ,
and that was all she needed .
okay .
so because the plaintiff was happy ,
all of a sudden , you think my dad &apos;s an honest man .
no .
i went there to see if i could let it go .
i know your dad is an honest man
because he &apos;s raised someone like you .
you were right .
i never should have questioned his integrity .
i was also right
that you never should &apos;ve taken this case .
no , you were wrong about that .
i told you we might fight ,
but it would bring us closer together ,
and it did .
and not just me and your father .
what does that mean ?
i mean you and your father .
i have never seen you leap to his defense like that .
i did leap to his defense , didn &apos;t i ?
you sure did .
you think our daughter will leap to my defense
like that one day ?
she sure will .
louis , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m doing here .
i &apos;m coming to you face @-@ to @-@ face about screwing my sister .
excuse me ?
i saw the terms , harvey . they &apos;re a joke .
no , they &apos;re what esther wanted .
and you swore you &apos;d stay out of this .
well , it &apos;s a good thing i didn &apos;t
because there &apos;s no way she wanted to give away
millions of dollars .
it &apos;s called being charitable in order to move on .
it &apos;s called jeffrey &apos;s a piece of shit ,
not the march of dimes .
he should be getting nothing .
instead of being focused on what he gets ,
you should be focused on what esther gets ,
which is to be happy .
wrong , litts are never happy ,
and you &apos;re using her to get to me .
how the hell am i doing that ?
you think i went after your money
by changing the firm &apos;s compensation structure .
you did come after my money !
and now you &apos;re going after esther &apos;s to even the score .
if i wanted to even the score ,
i wouldn &apos;t come after your sister .
i &apos;d be coming after you .
and for your information ,
i convinced her to be forgiving by telling her
that there are some things in life
that are more important than money .
bullshit ! you don &apos;t believe that .
louis , i didn &apos;t take this to get back at you .
i took it because it was a chance to bury the hatchet
and move on .
so either let these terms stand ,
or do what you always do and screw everything up .
robert , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here--
what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
i went to see emma powell ,
but i swear to god , i did not undermine the settlement .
i &apos;m not talking about that .
i &apos;m talking about you going behind my back to arcadian .
i didn &apos;t do that .
oh , you expect me to believe that
after all the shit you told me the last time i saw you ?
you can believe it or not ,
but i &apos;m telling you i didn &apos;t do anything .
then who did ?
i did .
you said if he colluded with arcadian ,
then we could shove a bigger settlement down their throats .
but he didn &apos;t have to collude ,
because arcadian already had access to that settlement .
which makes it insider trading anyway .
and i pointed out to them
that if they were to divest their shares
to our clients who don &apos;t have insider knowledge ,
then they &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
no harm done .
the harm is you lost me my client
and made me look like a fool .
no , robert , they did that
by not telling you what they did .
which means the client you lost
was breaking the law .
and worse than that ,
they were lying to their lawyer .
so you think this is funny ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i think your future son @-@ in @-@ law
trusted you had nothing to do with it
and then saved your ass from committing a crime .
you &apos;re ... welcome ?
thank you .
and you have my condolences .
for what ?
for having to deal with him .
oh , you have no idea .
hey , right here . i &apos;m standing right here , guys .
can i buy you a drink ?
if you guys , you know , need anything fixed or saved
that no one else seems to be able to do , i &apos;ll be right here .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to tell you how grateful i am .
you don &apos;t need to do that .
yes .
i do .
this whole mess
has been the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever gone through .
and i wouldn &apos;t have gotten through it
without you reminding me what &apos;s really important .
thank you for that .
take care , harvey .
good luck , esther .
oh , by the way ,
louis wanted me to tell you
how grateful he is too .
harvey .
louis .
what can i do for you ?
remember when i said , if wanted you
to make up for the compensation vote ,
i would come to you directly ?
well , now i am .
well , what happened to
&quot; some things in life are more important than money &quot; ?
this isn &apos;t about the money .
this is about making things right .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey .
for what ?
i act like i don &apos;t know esther &apos;s beautiful ,
but i do .
it started when we were in junior high
and all the cool kids would hang out with me
just so they could get close to her .
sometimes it worked , and sometimes it didn &apos;t ,
but either way , when it was over ...
they all acted like they didn &apos;t know me at all .
so when i thought
you were using her to get to me , i , uh--
i wasn &apos;t doing that , louis .
i know .
i &apos;ll take care of the compensation issue .
what can i do for you , harvey ?
i wanted to thank you .
for what ?
for 12 years .
