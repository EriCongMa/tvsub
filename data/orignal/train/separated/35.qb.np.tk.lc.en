good job , alicia .
thanks for going all out this year . it &apos;s been quite a ride .
and we &apos;re not out of the woods yet . we have a lot of trimming to do .
so we &apos;re all going to have to work harder .
do more with less .
i &apos;m ready .
we know you are .
you okay ?
yes .
don &apos;t worry , everything &apos;s going to be fine .
cary , do you have a minute ?
yes .
you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;m safe ?
pink slips are going out .
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of blood in these halls in about an hour .
they fired him .
they kept you ?
i got a client last minute through peter .
smart .
no .
you got a client .
cary would have done the same thing if he had that opportunity .
kalinda , don &apos;t .
do you have your keys ?
my ... ?
your car keys .
do you have them ?
why ?
i just want to compare them .
are you trying to distract me ?
yeah .
uh , kalinda ?
what are you doing ?
you won , he lost .
so you &apos;re going to turn this into some morbid thing
because that &apos;s who you are .
so , let &apos;s go .
let me get my bag .
it &apos;s a lockhart / gardner tradition .
now you &apos;re an associate-
two shots of tequila .
i have to be home by 8 : 00 .
let me see your phone .
no , kalinda , really , i have to get home .
alicia , i &apos;m taking responsibility for your irresponsibility .
let me see your phone .
hi . uh , who am i speaking to ?
zach . this is kalinda .
sure . one second .
hey , dad , mom &apos;s going to be working late again tonight .
tell her not to worry .
okay .
yeah , that &apos;s fine . thanks .
you don &apos;t look like a man who &apos;s going to be free in a few days .
there &apos;s been a hitch .
look , i really miss daniel golden .
well , when the obama white house calls , you got to go .
golden said she &apos;s the better litigator .
it &apos;s just easy to underestimate her .
well , she must be very , very good ,
because i &apos;m greatly underestimating her .
ms. tascioni , hi .
eli gold .
oh , yes . hello .
you &apos;re not good with computers , are you ?
my son keeps buying me new ones
and then just backing away- and laughing .
so what are we watching ?
evidence .
for the retrial ?
yep .
but the prosecution lost its only witness , right ?
kozko committed suicide , so they don &apos;t have a case .
and i thought monday would be a simple matter of a dismissal ,
but watch .
prosecution interview b @-@ 3 :
people v. peter florrick .
peter was pretty bald about it .
uh , $ 45,000 would buy you a certain amount of access .
$ 85,000- more .
did he say what he needed the money for ?
a down payment on a bigger house .
this is a video proffer completed by mr. kozko before his death .
the prosecution now plans to introduce it into evidence .
but they can &apos;t , because it &apos;s hearsay .
that &apos;s right .
and they don &apos;t want to use it .
they want the press to use it .
well , that was my first guess ,
but these aren &apos;t the motions of a prosecution winding down .
peter promised me an ear ,
and he also promised me his friendship .
come on , everybody , join the happy couple on the dance floor .
let go ...
no .
you know , will feels the same way about you .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
and even if he did , it doesn &apos;t matter .
it does .
i phone will , i tell him we &apos;re in a bar
and that you &apos;re too drunk to go home .
so you &apos;re getting a hotel room upstairs .
alicia , one night- no repercussions .
and tomorrow ?
tomorrow you wake up .
that &apos;s just not me , kalinda .
everything is you .
everything you want to be you is you .
you two are so hot .
and , um ...
you @-@ you are ?
brian . i &apos;m the best man .
what are you celebrating ?
tomorrow her husband is being freed from house arrest .
really ?
all right , uh , well , i &apos;m getting you both drinks .
yeah .
are you gay ?
oh , come on .
we are talking about every single little detail of my life .
it &apos;s a simple question .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m private .
ugh . come on .
what does it matter ?
it doesn &apos;t .
then why &apos;d you want to know ?
because i do .
and how is this fair ?
i talk about everything .
i didn &apos;t say it was .
you like to talk about your life .
i don &apos;t like to talk about mine .
what ?
nothing .
it &apos;s work .
hi . it &apos;s me .
yes . i know . hi .
how you doing ?
good , actually .
really good .
i &apos;m glad . you deserve it .
um , how about you ?
well , we &apos;re in the midst of layoffs .
oh , god . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no . it just has to be done .
alicia , i ...
you ... ?
i , um ...
can i ask you a favor ?
i just got a call from a client who needs help ,
but i can &apos;t get away right now .
oh , um , yeah , of course .
which client ?
colin sweeney .
i know . look , it &apos;ll be easy .
we just revamp the language on his company merger .
i &apos;m sure he just wants to ask a few questions before he signs .
i was gonna send brad , but
we just let him go .
oh , god . no , of course .
um , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s close to here .
thanks .
don &apos;t leave without a fully @-@ executed copy , okay ?
this merger is very important to the firm .
thanks .
i &apos;m really glad this worked out .
yeah . me , too . bye .
just give me a minute .
yes . who &apos;s there ?
mr. sweeney , it &apos;s alicia florrick .
will gardner sent me .
uh , sure , come on up .
mr. sweeney ?
mr. sweeney ?
uh , in the study .
uh , could you grab the camera on the table , please , dear ?
i have a cab waiting , mr. sweeney .
will gardner said you &apos;d have a ... red @-@ lined contract waiting for me .
i can explain .
this ...
this is not what it looks like .
oh , oh , yeah , the camera . yes .
um , i ...
could you ? i can &apos;t reach .
i already phoned 911 a minute ago .
is she dead ?
sheila ? yeah .
it was self @-@ defense .
you have to believe that .
she attacked me .
uh , sorry . i just ...
mr. sweeney , stop !
kalinda , there &apos;s been ...
i need your help at colin sweeney &apos;s .
there &apos;s been a murder .
no . i don &apos;t know .
um , i didn &apos;t know it was a crime scene ,
and my fingerprints are on ... mr. sweeney , don &apos;t !
they were just so embarrassing .
the pictures .
put the camera down .
as soon as you can . thanks .
don &apos;t move !
hello ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
is someone else here ?
no . why ?
here comes the cavalry !
he never hurt anyone .
chili- he barely even barked .
so you &apos;re saying she killed your dog ?
even though the victim has
no defensive wounds on her body from a canine attack .
mr. sweeney is choosing not to answer at this time , detective .
mrs. florrick ,
you said that your fingerprints were on , uh ...
on the doorbell , on the entering doorknob ,
on the banister ...
on the camera .
he opened the back of the camera ?
i can &apos;t answer that , due to attorney @-@ client privilege .
but your fingerprints are on the camera ?
yes , as i said .
so you &apos;re still insisting that you didn &apos;t tamper with evidence ?
yes .
even though i smell alcohol on your breath ?
tony ...
this is my job , ms. sharma .
i don &apos;t interfere with your job .
we were celebrating when i received a phone call from mr. sweeney .
excuse me . from mr. gardner ...
a partner at my firm .
he told me to come here to collect contracts .
i arrived by cab . i did not drive myself .
you &apos;re under arrest for murder , mr. sweeney .
back in the cuffs i go .
listen to me , mr. sweeney .
remain silent .
irony does not work here .
jokes don &apos;t work .
do you understand ?
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
all rise !
the honorable graham schickel presiding .
good morning .
as the youngest justice on the bench in the state of illinois ,
i would like to say welcome .
and i believe you have a motion , mr. state &apos;s attorney ?
i do , your honor .
we move to introduce into evidence the video proffer
made by our key witness gerald kozco , recently deceased .
yes , your honor . hi .
um , i hate to object right off the bat here ,
but , uh , the key word here is &quot; deceased &quot;
mr. florrick has a right to challenge his accuser .
i can &apos;t cross @-@ examine a dead witness , as much as i &apos;d like to try .
uh , your honor , two years ago ,
illinois legislature , in a 109 @-@ to @-@ 0 vote ,
passed the peterson law , which makes us the only state in the union
which allows hearsay evidence- such as this proffer- when
the accused benefits from the death .
ah , getting novel on us , mr. childs .
this law is almost as new as i am .
yes , your honor ,
but unfortunately for mr. childs ,
the peterson law requires the accused benefit not just from a death ,
but from a murder he committed .
and mr. kozco committed suicide .
the police have not made that determination , your honor .
no body has been found yet ,
and we will present evidence to the contrary .
my apologies , your honor .
i &apos;m sorry . i found that humorous .
mr. childs would like to prove my client is a murderer ,
so he can prosecute him for corruption ?
well , that is certainly novel .
well , novel or not ,
we will hear evidence on this alleged murder tomorrow .
guys in the bureau might want to keep track of mr. florrick ...
yes , he &apos;s talking with the feds .
i think things just got more serious .
coordinating strategy ?
i don &apos;t know .
hi . are you two coordinating strategy ?
mr. childs and i are old friends .
what a relief .
she would ambush me . i &apos;d fight .
and if i won , we &apos;d have sex .
she was your stalker , but you encouraged her ?
it was a game .
she &apos;d break in , i would disarm her , we &apos;d have sex .
it was terrific .
this time , it was different .
this time , she tried to kill me .
the police are calling the victim a jane doe .
do you have any idea who she was ?
no . i just knew her as sheila penn .
you said she wrote you ?
yes , classic stalker letters .
where are they ?
in his bedside table ,
which means the police already have it .
let &apos;s petition the court for access to these letters .
when do we get forensics , blood work ?
preliminary , three days .
we should get an expedited necropsy on the dog .
i think that &apos;s a cul @-@ de @-@ sac .
preliminary m.e. report
shows no defensive wounds on the victim from a canine attack .
yes , but sweeney said
he heard no barking at all when the jane doe broke in .
so maybe the attacker sedated the dog first .
that would show up in a necropsy .
and if we can prove jane doe sedated the dog , it &apos;s premeditation ;
she went there with the purpose of doing harm .
good , it &apos;s a place to start .
get the letters and get the dog .
alicia , do you have a second ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t know . i thought it was contracts .
i never would &apos;ve sent you there .
will , really , it &apos;s fine .
how are you handling it ?
the body , the blood .
good .
i didn &apos;t really think about it .
what a weird life we lead , huh ?
so , are we normal again , are we dealing with it ?
we talking about the crime scene now ?
no .
yes , we &apos;re dealing with it .
well , welcome back .
talk about the luck of job .
on the brink of merging sweeney &apos;s company with another one ,
if this happens .
the merger &apos;s not off @-@ track yet .
i &apos;m phoning to check everybody &apos;s temperature .
the ceo was just accused of murder .
everybody &apos;ll scramble .
not necessarily . the buyer &apos;s motivated , and money is money .
what &apos;s that about ?
oh , the layoffs .
yes . won &apos;t be a fun day .
cary ...
i &apos;m just getting my laptop .
i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .
sorry you got the job ,
or sorry for what you did to get the job ?
sorry we both didn &apos;t get the job .
alicia , here &apos;s the thing ...
you like to think you &apos;re a good person ,
and maybe at one time you were ,
but we both know
you &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
sleeping with the boss ? check .
cary , if it makes you feel better to think that ,
then think it , but ...
i don &apos;t have a name ,
alicia , i don &apos;t have a fairy godmother i can phone up
or the whole chicago political machine .
i had to work , i had to sweat ,
i had to make money for this firm ,
and that &apos;s just not enough .
sir , you have to leave .
i need my laptop and my personal items .
you can itemize them , and they will be collected
and sent to your home .
i need them now .
that &apos;s not possible , sir .
they &apos;ll be returned to you within three working days .
this was not fair .
and i was stupid- i acted like it would be .
so , these letters were sent to sweeney ?
yeah . sweeney &apos;s at least telling the truth about being stalked .
&quot; you &apos;re dead meat , my darling .
i feast on dead meat .
is she still a jane doe ?
yep .
what ?
you know what &apos;s odd ?
these letters are filled with details from his trial .
a juror ?
it &apos;s the legal language she uses .
&quot; i want to kill that idiot deponent . &quot;
&quot; i hate the rule 30 slut . &quot;
it &apos;s like someone in the business .
these are from the first trial .
who &apos;s this ?
court reporter .
yeah .
that could be her .
yeah .
what &apos;s her name ?
burton , get ready to write down an address .
not to sound too melodramatic , your honor ,
but objection . really .
your honor , mrs. kozko heard directly from her husband
that if he were to die under mysterious circumstances
that it would be at peter florrick &apos;s hand .
yes , and i heard from a butterfly it wouldn &apos;t be .
both are hearsay statements ,
your honor , and equally inadmissible .
the peterson law allows for exactly such hearsay testimony .
so let me get this straight-
it allows for hearsay as long as a murder is established .
and a murder is established here
because there &apos;s a hearsay statement that establishes it
i mean , tell me when the snake actually devours its tail , okay ?
ms. tascioni , you &apos;re ridiculing established illinois law .
yes , your honor , gleefully .
well , i know i &apos;m the , uh , youngest judge on the bench
but ...
yes , your honor , we &apos;re all in awe .
but i will overrule your objection .
given the peterson law , this testimony is allowed .
if you have a problem with that ,
you can take it up with the supreme court .
okay . now i get to work .
hybristophiliac .
women who are irresistibly attracted to dangerous men .
it &apos;s quite common .
women who propose to charlie manson
or send their panties to jeffrey dahmer .
45 years .
no .
see you in court .
fine . this isn &apos;t gangbanger number five , ms. lockhart ;
this is colin sweeney .
people want him behind bars .
then people should find better evidence ,
because this screams self @-@ defense , ma &apos;am .
the thing is ...
these letters didn &apos;t just go one way .
how &apos;s peter doing ?
fine ... thank you .
where &apos;d you get these ?
the victim &apos;s house .
you see , mr. sweeney wrote back , encouraging her , taunting her .
i &apos;m sure you can find a psychological term for that , too .
hysterical prosecution ?
45 years .
here is a copy of the victim &apos;s diary
with some very interesting entries on your client ,
and some quite specific descriptions of their sexual practices .
so , this is you ?
this is me ?
milking it ?
the wife of peter florrick representing a killer .
interesting . i hadn &apos;t considered that .
well , what about this ?
the state &apos;s attorney hired a sick , killer @-@ obsessed court reporter
for some of the state &apos;s most high @-@ profile criminal cases .
now that will be a fun lawsuit .
well , you got me there , mrs. florrick .
so , let &apos;s try this . why don &apos;t we both just do our jobs ?
of course i wrote back .
i love a good fetish .
cut the crap , mr. sweeney .
you &apos;re looking at 45 years .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
please take a look at the diary , mr. sweeney .
sheila ... warburg ?
my god , how prosaic .
sweaty suburban sex with sheila warburg .
we need to figure out what &apos;s true and what she made up .
well , this is not true . this one here .
i &apos;m not opposed to it in principle . but my goodness .
if you could underline the parts that are fiction ?
certainly .
look ...
i had sex with her twice .
she liked to pretend to break in and handcuff me .
we would wrestle , then we &apos;d have sex .
but this time , she wouldn &apos;t stop .
i tried to get her to drop the knife , but ... then we @-@ we struggled ,
and @-@ and the knife ...
it went in .
that &apos;s it .
okay , we &apos;ll get back to you .
right . i have to go . give me a few hours .
julius !
the merger &apos;s on .
if anything , mr. sweeney &apos;s troubles have shored up the buyer &apos;s interest .
they were scared of his volatility .
meaning ?
well , we &apos;re not changing our defense strategy , but ...
it would benefit us if mr. sweeney took a plea ?
okay , we can &apos;t say that ,
but i &apos;m backing away from mr. sweeney &apos;s defense .
a chinese wall .
you and alicia continue , and we &apos;ll say no more .
make any deal you can , defend him any way you can .
we won &apos;t talk to you , you won &apos;t talk to us . okay ?
got it .
are you dancing a jig inside ?
like rose on the titanic .
cary agos !
marty .
you work here ?
uh , no . trying to . i thought you were at lockhart / gardner .
yeah . i was . layoffs .
oh , my god . same at orren &amp; polk .
and i wouldn &apos;t even go in here .
they &apos;re just lining up resumes for 2011 .
come on , let &apos;s go get a drink .
ah , maybe i &apos;ll give it a try .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
well , go for it .
hey , did you hear about corsican ?
harvard review , clerked for scalia .
now he &apos;s writing a screenplay .
about what ?
who cares ?
hey , so , if you change your mind ,
some of the old buds are getting together at brandos , all right ? drop by .
okay , get them to his desk today , and i will meet you there .
the fbi doesn &apos;t give you much space , does it ?
this is the size of my old college dorm room .
were you visiting someone else in the building , mr. gold ?
i was , but i thought i &apos;d make a little detour .
i can &apos;t talk about any ongoing investigations .
oh , i didn &apos;t think you could .
i thought i &apos;d talk about &apos; em .
oh , knock yourself out .
glenn childs has it out for my client .
it is a politically @-@ motivated prosecution ,
and the fbi should not be in the business of taking sides .
you are reading too much into my visit with mr. childs .
he is giving you evidence against florrick .
he is suggesting that florrick is responsible for kozko &apos;s death .
and you &apos;re buying it .
well , you know your secret investigation of my client-
it &apos;s no longer a secret .
i &apos;ve seen this .
i know you have , but you haven &apos;t seen it ... on the side of a bus .
and i had it made into buttons .
one for each of the reporters visiting the court .
and ... coffee mugs .
and this is a little mouse pad , just for you .
you think this will scare us , mr. gold ?
the office that took down capone ?
really ?
oh , i know how the fbi works ... ma &apos;am .
you don &apos;t like to hunt for new game .
you &apos;d rather take down an already bleeding deer ,
because you want to look good for your superiors .
well , this is just to say that we are not bleeding .
we have a lot of fight left in us yet .
so go find some new game .
we need to talk .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
it &apos;s sweeney . when is it ever good ?
i got the results of the dog necropsy .
no drugs in chili ?
that &apos;s not all .
there was blood on the dog &apos;s fur from the victim .
makes sense .
blood when she broke in .
no , she didn &apos;t cut herself from breaking in .
it &apos;s from the struggle .
it ... it can &apos;t be .
she wasn &apos;t alive after the struggle .
right .
and there was also blood from sweeney .
and these . hesitation knife wounds ,
with a tentative angling of the knife .
someone hesitated before they killed the dog ?
yep .
the dog &apos;s owner ?
hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
he was so innocent .
you did it ?
you actually killed your dog ?
who was going to believe me ?
not a soul . you don &apos;t .
i panicked .
i- i thought if the police saw she killed my dog , they &apos;d see ...
mr. sweeney ,
we &apos;re gonna have to talk about taking a plea .
maybe we can talk them down to 30 years .
i didn &apos;t do this .
just stop it .
mr. sweeney , stop it . you killed your dog .
yeah , but this lady tried to kill me .
i was protecting myself .
oh , my god .
we &apos;ll try to make the best deal we can , mr. sweeney .
you used to drop the h @-@ bomb , people would look up ,
put your resume on the top .
now everybody &apos;s , &quot; ah , so what ? harvard grad &quot;
hey , look- justice hart .
no , he &apos;s already staffed up .
so you guys just drink here , trying to get a job ?
you make it sound so sad .
we &apos;re absorbing legal culture .
thanks , guys .
glenn childs , six o &apos;clock .
huhuh . righ .
when i want to make a first @-@ year teacher &apos;s salary .
well , they &apos;re not hiring , anyway .
so , cary , you &apos;re the last one working .
what &apos;s your severance ?
my severance ? i don &apos;t know .
oh , you &apos;ll find out .
last one working pays .
all right .
have you read outliers by malcolm gladwell ?
excuse me ?
the book .
outliers by malcolm gladwell .
okay .
it says the beatles are the beatles
because they played 10,000 hours in a german strip club .
bill gates is bill gates because
he worked 10,000 hours in an after @-@ school computer lab .
what do you want , mr. childs ?
to get you the chance to work 10,000 hours
prosecuting the worst scum in chicago .
i know who you are , cary .
i know you &apos;re responsible for some of our worst defeats .
and i also know that you were underappreciated
and undervalued at lockhart / gardner .
i want you to join us , i want you to ...
yes .
i &apos;ll need your help with alicia florrick .
she and her husband ...
yes .
good .
see you tomorrow .
thanks .
here we go . i think i hold control , shift and d.
no . f.
no . actually , ms. tascioni , i - i am a little busy .
i have a client .
yes , the problem is , i lack confidence with computers .
can we ... do this another time ?
did you know mrs. kozko has three children ?
anthony , lisa and arthur .
i didn &apos;t .
anthony is the oldest , lisa &apos;s the middle child , and ...
darn !
control , c ?
arthur is the youngest ?
yes . arthur is the youngest .
well , mr. and mrs. kozko
placed $ 45,000 in all of their accounts for college .
mr. gold ?
very nice gesture .
and this money was not to be touched
until they graduated from high school .
well , anthony already graduated from college , so he spent his .
and lisa is in college now ,
so she &apos;s halfway through her spending .
and arthur ...
arthur didn &apos;t start spending his college money until this year .
two weeks ago , to be specific .
okay .
well , the funny thing is , arthur isn &apos;t in college .
in fact , arthur was a stillborn birth in 1992 .
now , that is funny .
yes .
and that got me thinking-
who is withdrawing all this money from his bank account ?
and where is it withdrawn ?
funny you should ask .
stl bank and trust in savannah .
georgia ?
no .
did you know there &apos;s another savannah , in the cayman islands ?
i did not know that .
it &apos;s interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
so how are you ahead of the police on this ?
they &apos;re not looking .
you seem to be down one partner today .
and i &apos;m wearing a different tie .
what &apos;s that matter ?
we want involuntary manslaughter , five years .
with forty time off ?
that &apos;s three years for a brutal sexual homicide .
second degree , 15 years , and we &apos;re putting
a 24 @-@ hour clock on it .
offer expires tomorrow .
we have proof that sweeney was stalked .
can we at least stipulate the victim stalked him ?
agreed , he was stalked . so ?
there are stalker statutes on the books-
statutes that my husband instituted when he was in office .
and your point is , mrs. florrick ?
talk to your boss .
what sort of message would he be sending
to stalking victims if sweeney &apos;s prosecuted ?
are you really trying a blame @-@ the @-@ victim defense with colin sweeney ?
offer him ten years , and we don &apos;t have to go to trial .
then let me talk to my boss .
where is diane ?
chinese wall .
criminal and acquisitions .
the merger ?
yes . it &apos;s my guess ,
it &apos;s probably more lucrative if sweeney &apos;s out of the picture .
if sweeney takes a plea , he can be removed as ceo .
does sweeney know about this ?
he knows that we represent his criminal and financial interests .
yes .
feighen ladsloe .
the murderer ?
mm @-@ hmm . on death row .
sheila corresponded with him .
before sweeney ?
you know , i thought i recognized those entries in her diary .
the ones sweeney said were fiction-
they were from feighen &apos;s trial .
the court reporter ?
yeah . i &apos;m checking all of her trials now ,
see what other killers she corresponded with .
where you going ?
to tell julius .
this could get them down from ten years .
hey .
hey . how &apos;s that chinese wall ?
mrs. florrick ,
as much i like keeping our working relationship collegial ,
don &apos;t forget , you &apos;re a junior associate ,
and i &apos;m an equity partner .
watch your tone .
yes , sir . i will .
i think we should reconsider the plea bargain .
kalinda &apos;s found new evidence .
what evidence ?
sheila warbur , she stalked other killers .
so you think he &apos;s innocent ?
no .
i think he &apos;s innocent of this .
i am ready to hear mrs. kozko &apos;s testimony , ms. tascioni .
yes , just one last objection , your honor .
the peterson law- as atrocious as it may be ...
objection .
sustained .
it requires that mr. florrick not only profit from a murder ,
but be the instrument of that murder , correct ?
are you asking me , ms. tascioni ?
um , no , but you can answer if you want to .
and you can get to the point .
oh , okay . well ,
for mr. kozko to be murdered ,
one key thing is required that we overlooked .
and what is that , ms. tascioni ?
that he be dead .
i did it .
um , this is an atm photo taken a week ago
at bcp bank and trust in savannah , cayman islands .
your honor , mrs. kozko &apos;s hearsay testimony is inadmissible ,
and mr. kozko &apos;s video proffer is likewise inadmissible
for the very simple reason that mr. kozko is still alive .
quiet . quiet , please .
it &apos;s done .
you &apos;re free .
kalinda .
so , your boy is free .
my boy ?
florrick . he just won .
really ?
yeah .
so i hear there are some tapes .
oh , there are always some tapes .
and i hear that they hurt childs and florrick ,
so neither wanted to use them .
mutually assured destruction .
sounds like a fairy tale .
funny how fairy tales turn out to be true .
here &apos;s the thing , kalinda .
this isn &apos;t about childs or florrick .
this is about childs and florrick .
we &apos;re investigating them both ,
and i just don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
thank you for your concern .
i &apos;m your friend here .
it &apos;s good to know .
so you would advise me to take this ?
it &apos;s the best deal we could have made .
eight years ,
and this is after we started with
what i would have said was a ... an adamant 45 .
mrs. florrick ?
it &apos;s true .
they started with 45 years .
and why not court ?
well , it &apos;s coming down to perceptions , mr. sweeney .
we would have filed for a change of venue , but ...
i &apos;m famous everywhere ?
yes .
they like me here . in prison .
i &apos;m like the king of kings .
it &apos;s not unlike getting the best table at schwa , actually .
same jockeying for position .
we have until 6 : 00 to take the plea .
okay , thank you , julius .
i- i @-@ i need to talk to mrs. florrick for a second .
we &apos;re , uh , working together .
yes , i understand .
i just have a piece of gossip i want to share , please .
it &apos;s about the merger ?
yes .
the company means more with me out of the picture ?
yes .
and ...
can i get better than eight years ?
no .
and if we go to trial ?
i don &apos;t know .
sheila warburg has stalked other killers ,
but i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s enough to overcome your ...
your baggage .
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s what i thought .
well ...

so i guess the universe is having its little joke at my expense .
