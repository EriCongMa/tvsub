dolls ?
this is the police ! stay where you are !
they set us up !
i wish i could see those bitches right now .
there &apos;s nothing left to link us to that night .
what i want is for you to forget about me .
if you really want to worry about somebody ,
why don &apos;t you worry about your sister
and that cop boyfriend of hers .
i &apos;m in love with your daughter .
this was going on while you were her teacher ?
you are gonna leave this house right now .
dad !
we &apos;re moving back to rosewood--
me , isabel , kate .
i want the box that jason gave aria .
well , you &apos;re not gonna get it .
we &apos;re not gonna be making any kind of a deal with &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a &quot; took the bait .
&quot; want to make a deal ? &quot;
you &apos;re afraid we found something ,
something in this box .
no ! emily !
that &apos;s &quot; a &quot; &apos; s cellphone !
how hard did you hit him-- her-- it ?
didn &apos;t run like a her .
i thought it was an animal .
it was . is .
okay , where is the box ?
you guys , this phone is locked .
and where were you guys ?
i thought we were supposed to meet up here .
wasn &apos;t that the plan ?
i &apos;m so sorry , em .
i @-@ i dropped a huge bomb at home .
my parents won &apos;t let me go anywhere .
i had to crawl through mike &apos;s window .
and toby came in and totally cornered me
with all of these questions about why i was acting this way ,
and he would not leave without any answers .
kate &apos;s moving to rosewood .
what ? !
yeah .
yeah , my dad and isabel got married ,
and now they &apos;re looking for a house here in rosewood .
so now i have more than one monster in my life .
okay ? i win .
no , you don &apos;t ! i was almost killed !
these are not highlights , hanna .
this is glass in my hair !
okay .
you guys , can you talk to me for a second ?
i &apos;m holding &quot; a &quot; &apos; s phone in my hand .
what are we doing with it ?
something , before &quot; a &quot; knows we have it .
stand still .
hanna , call caleb !
why ?
he &apos;s the best way that we can get information off of this .
leave him out of this .
but he &apos;s our best shot at tracing this back to &quot; a. &quot;
there are other people , okay ?
we &apos;ll take it to the phone store tomorrow .
the-- the phone store ? !
well , then , call technical support !
we can have someone in pakistan do it !
hanna !
this can &apos;t wait until tomorrow .
once &quot; a &quot; realizes it &apos;s missing-- !
i get it , okay ?
but this phone is connected to jenna
and officer garrett .
caleb already has bad history with her and the police .
we &apos;re not going there !
okay , but if he can find something
that finally nails the two of them together--
at least consider it .
hanna , come on , think this through .
i am .
okay , you done thinking ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re running out of time here .
wait , is caleb still crashing with lucas ?
where &apos;s lucas &apos; house ?
i &apos;ll go over there and ...
spencer , stop giving us orders !
we &apos;re not your winged monkeys !
guys , stop !
there &apos;s got to be a way that
we can get caleb to help without--
answer it .
answer it . answer it !
why me ? i &apos;ve got glass in my hair !
i &apos;ll answer it ! what do you want me to say ?
should we tell them that we have the phone ?
they &apos;ll know that when you say hello .
it &apos;s blocked .
i &apos;ve got caleb &apos;s number ! i &apos;m calling him !
go !
what &apos;s that number ?
tells me how much data is currently loaded on the phone .
it &apos;s a lot .
you mean like photos , videos ... ?
definitely more than angry birds .
and how long will it take to download ?
we &apos;re not there yet .
hanna .
hm ?
you all right ?
yeah .
all right , can somebody tell me whose phone this is ?
we can &apos;t . yet .
the less you know right now , the better .
o @-@ kay .
well , then , can somebody at least tell me
why emily smells like a bag of mulch ?
wait .
something just came up .
crap .
what just happened ?
phone got bricked .
translate , please .
the owner shut down the phone
from their computer .
so we lost everything ?
we never had everything .
i have some files , but they &apos;re locked
and they &apos;re probably corrupted .
i can try and retrieve what i have ,
but it &apos;s gonna take a while .
are you sure you want me to work on this ?
yes !
yes !
hanna , are you all right with this ?
morning .
um , where are you going ?
school .
wearing that ?
yeah . what are you talking about ?
well , that &apos;s not appropriate for school ,
so ... change your clothes .
since when have i had a dress code , dad ?
since we became aware of who you might be dressing for ,
so change your clothes .
okay , well , what am i supposed to wear , a down parka ?
byron , i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve got this .
if i were you , i &apos;d pick and choose my battles .
since when did wearing knee @-@ highs become a battle ?
today is not the day to question your father .
why ? he , of all people , coming down on me
for an inappropriate relationship ?
aria !
i &apos;m sorry .
i just thought maybe at least ... you would ...
that i would what ?
that i would give my teenage daughter
and mr. fitz my blessing ?
your father and i are in agreement here
because we were lied to for a really long time
by you and by a colleague .
well , i didn &apos;t tell you guys
because i was scared that you would react--
react like this .
yeah , well , evidently you know us a lot better
than we know you , but that &apos;s gonna change
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna be spending
a lot more time with your family
and a lot less time with your friends .
what does ezra have to do with my friends ?
and you &apos;re gonna be cutting him off completely ,
and that means not even saying goodbye .
is that clear ?
do you like him ?
what ?
do you like him ?
i did .
hey , could we talk ?
can we do it some place a little bit more private ?
look , i know that you want answers ,
and i &apos;m close ,
i &apos;m so close to giving them to you ,
but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just still not safe .
then why did you come here ?
because i missed you .
shutting you out is killing me .
so you came here to tell me you can &apos;t be here .
what are you working on ?
you and your friends gave me homework , remember ?
you &apos;re doing that here ?
nobody knows what i &apos;m working on .
so , uh , when do i get inducted into this secret society ?
hey , i like playing mission : impossible as much as the next guy ,
but , uh , i &apos;m starting to feel like somebody doesn &apos;t trust me .
who ?
me ?
caleb ! come on , i trust you .
but ... not with this .
we have gotten naked together in more ways than one , han .
why are we suddenly strangers
when it comes to a stolen phone ?
it wasn &apos;t stolen , we found it .
why don &apos;t i believe that ?
oh , hey , lucas !
are we still on for after school ?
oh , um ... you know , i might be ...
please don &apos;t bag on me .
okay , if i don &apos;t get at least a b @-@ plus on this test ...
please . please please .
fine .
i can give you , like , an hour .
you &apos;re a good man , lucas .
so , can we talk about this phone stuff later ?
maybe . see you at lunch .
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t get it ! i don &apos;t understand , jenna !
hey , hey ! can we not do this on the phone , please ?
please , i &apos;m outside your house .
stop punishing me and just open the damn door !
please !
what is going on ?
it &apos;s been like fight club since last night .
they were arguing on the porch .
she slammed the door in his face .
this started last night ?
i think it &apos;s nerves .
jenna plays it cool , but she &apos;s freaking
about having the eye operation .
yeah ? well , that &apos;s what happens
when it &apos;s not just the two of us .
no , no , the mistake was pulling in somebody else .
asking him to help us was a bad idea , jenna .
it was a bad move . no , no , i warned you . no .
it was your idea .
this doesn &apos;t sound like it &apos;s about an eye operation .
who is &quot; he &quot; ? who are they talking about ?
just-- can you-- can you wait just a second ?
jenna , don &apos;t hang up . answer the door !
uh ... jenna , no , wait .
just wait a second .
don &apos;t hang up , just come to the door .
jenna ?
jenna ?
damn it !
emily , you &apos;ve got about five more minutes .
is there any way i can take this on monday ?
i didn &apos;t have time to finish the last few chapters .
it &apos;s a makeup test , emily .
the class has moved on to another book .
what about after school tomorrow ?
i can &apos;t .
i have community service .
they gave me additional hours for ...
um ... fighting with spencer .
are you still picking up trash ?
phone calls . it &apos;s a community crisis hotline ,
and today is my first day .
well , you girls seem to have a lot of experience with crises .
maybe you can help someone learn how to avoid them .
how &apos; bout after school on monday ?
emily .
what else do i not know about my daughter ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
wasn &apos;t fair of me to ask that . sorry .
aria &apos;s the same person she &apos;s always been ,
someone you can be proud of .
nothing &apos;s changed .
hey , there , it &apos;s ezra . can &apos;t talk , but you can ,
soon as you hear the ...
hi , it &apos;s me .
um , i &apos;m using hanna &apos;s phone
&apos;cause i &apos;m scared
my dad &apos;s gonna start combing through my phone bills .
it &apos;s still pretty intense , but ...
but that doesn &apos;t mean it can &apos;t change .
they &apos;re gonna come around . i @-@ i know that they will .
i love you so much .
i hate not being able to see you .
thanks .
hey . how was your test ?
i &apos;m doing a makeup of a makeup .
i &apos;ve got to run . community service starts at four p.m. , sharp .
wait . yours is today ? i was hoping you &apos;d be able
to come snoop around jason &apos;s house with me .
jason &apos;s ? why jason ?
well , if jenna and garrett have a helper ,
and it &apos;s a he , where does your mind go ?
it &apos;s going to community service . ask aria .
i did . she &apos;s under house arrest .
and besides , she really believes
that jason &apos;s been out of town for weeks .
then ask hanna . hanna spent all of chem class ...
drawing pictures of me in a pointy hat
and a wart on my nose .
she &apos;ll get over it .
offer her your lake house .
she needs some serious face time with caleb .
my lake house ?
i &apos;ve already made some memories on that couch in the living room .
she-- she didn &apos;t tell you ?
that was my nana &apos;s couch .
so , who ditched the union first ?
south carolina ?
did we make a card for them ?
georgia , alabama ...
hello ? what &apos;s going on ?
um , sorry , i was just ...
uh , thinking about louisiana .
please don &apos;t check out on me .
okay , i need you . i can &apos;t even spell &quot; louisiana . &quot;
is that caleb ?
spencer .
why don &apos;t we have a card for maryland ?
border state-- didn &apos;t secede until after the war began .
what was that about ?
uh , she offered me and caleb her lake house .
and you &apos;re not interested ?
oh , i &apos;m interested , but if i wait an hour ,
she might throw in maid service , and if i wait two hours ,
she might send a helicopter to take us there .
um ... i &apos;m gonna make a new card for virginia .
or if i waited three hours ,
she might let me have caleb &apos;s birthday party there .
oh , my god , that &apos;s awesome--
a surprise party at the lake house !
oh , look . we have two cards for north carolina .
lucas , you could help me .
we could do it together .
no , no , you don &apos;t need me .
of course i need you .
you &apos;re , like , his best friend .
you &apos;re roomies . you &apos;re like patrick and spongebob .
look , hanna , if we &apos;re not gonna study ,
i really need to get going .
that lake house is perfect .
it &apos;s secluded . there &apos;s a dock , a rowboat , a pier ,
and , you know , we could hang a big sign there .
that sounds really fun ... and pricey .
i &apos;m not really in a position to pitch in .
no . no , i &apos;ll pay for everything .
i just need your help .
caleb &apos;s probably never even had a birthday party before .
and if we do this ,
it would mean a lot to him .
you &apos;ll find a contract in the back of the packet .
every volunteer must sign it .
this protects you and the caller .
there must be anonymity on both sides of the phone .
you look overwhelmed .
relax . none of you will be answering any calls
until you &apos;ve had some training .
keep in mind , most of the time
they really just need someone to listen .
so , who wants to read with me ?
emily ?
here . help me out .
this is a transcript of a call that came in last night .
ready ?
&quot; crisis hotline . can i help you ? &quot;
&quot; i need to talk to someone .
i &apos;m in a bad place , and i don &apos;t know what to do .
i almost got caught tonight . &quot;
&quot; well , calling here is a good start .
uh , let &apos;s talk this through . &quot;
&quot; i was asked to do something important ,
and i tried my best , but i screwed it up . &quot;
&quot; okay . but maybe we can figure this out ,
and the situation-- &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s gone ,
and i can &apos;t get it back .
all i could do is shut it down . &quot;
&quot; shut what down ? can you tell me exactly what you &apos;ve lost ? &quot;
&quot; they &apos;re never gonna forgive me .
they &apos;re gonna make my life a living hell .
i might as well be dead . &quot;
did this person call here last night ?
and was it a man or a woman ?
not relevant .
let &apos;s continue .
emily ...
you okay ?
what ?
oh . sorry .
may i come in ?
ella and i once went to a party in this building ,
back in grad school days .
do you want some water , or a-- a beer ?
no , no thanks .
i , uh , i &apos;ve been thinking a lot
since you came over to our house .
yeah , yeah , byron , i--
no , let-- let me get this out .
i &apos;ve been teaching for 17 years .
i know how tricky it can be
to navigate some teacher / student relationships ,
and i have made some bad choices
that i later regretted ,
though it didn &apos;t involve a minor .
and i also know that my daughter
went through a very traumatic year ...
and that you were there for her ...
in a way her parents couldn &apos;t be .
but that doesn &apos;t make it okay .
so , before i leave here tonight ,
i want your assurance that this was a mistake ,
and that it &apos;s over ,
and that you will never see aria again .
look , as soon as i realized she was my student ,
i knew it was wrong . it couldn &apos;t go on .
which is why i took the job at hollis .
you giving that to me was an incredible gift ,
and i ...
has she been here ?
sorry , what ?
is this where you spent your time together ?
byron , as i said--
i heard what you said .
i don &apos;t think you heard me .
you &apos;re never seeing aria again .
ever .
and i will make sure that the police see to that .
okay , so , clarification :
is our invitation coming by snail @-@ mail ?
what ?
did you send it to my address or hers ?
oh , uh ... i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d want to come .
to a rockin &apos; party at spencer &apos;s lake house ?
i can see where you &apos;d be confused .
we &apos;ll be there .
yeah , um , it &apos;s a surprise party .
for ... caleb .
surprise !
he and i are friends now . all is forgiven .
&quot; i almost got caught tonight .
&quot; it &apos;s gone , and i can &apos;t get it back .
i might as well be dead . &quot;
tell me that does not sound like &quot; a &quot; &apos; s helper .
they let you keep this ?
no ! they don &apos;t know i have it .
okay , so i have good news and i have bad news .
have you seen this ?
are you kidding ?
i woke up to it .
emily taped it to our bathroom mirror .
we knew that it wasn &apos;t jenna in the greenhouse ,
but now it looks like it wasn &apos;t--
it was her drone .
okay , i think that we
should all be working at this crisis hotline .
i mean , if &quot; a &apos;s &quot; helper calls back , we can--
nnnn ... no .
i can &apos;t work at a hotline . i &apos;m on lockdown .
i can barely even pee without a chaperone .
wait , you &apos;re coming to my surprise party , right ?
nope , not unless you &apos;re throwing it in my closet .
hey , guys , you got a minute ?
i finally cracked one of these files ...
but i &apos;m guessing that wasn &apos;t what you were looking for .
what are you looking for ?
no , this is--
this is really great .
could you please forward this picture to all of us ?
i really have to get to class .
thanks , caleb .
yeah , thank you .
hanna , what else happened when i was in california ?
you , your friends ,
everyone &apos;s acting really strange--
even lucas .
no one &apos;s looking me in the eye .
well , i &apos;m looking at you ,
and i &apos;m wondering what to get you for your birthday dinner .
we can get takeout ,
just for the two of us .
what do you want ?
how &apos; bout a big , steaming plate of the truth ,
starting with this found phone .
no , caleb , i didn &apos;t lie about that .
i just can &apos;t say anymore .
and you don &apos;t think that &apos;s a problem for us ?
no , it &apos;s not a problem .
we don &apos;t have a problem , do we ?
we do if you &apos;re holding back the important stuff .
that &apos;s not the important stuff .
this is the important stuff .
i mean , he actually stood
there in front of me justifying his behavior .
you should have been there .
yes , i should have .
well , i followed an-- an impulse , ella .
what are you looking for ?
an aspirin !
how did this family go from a happy christmas card in europe
to this fractured , deceitful mess ?
ella , don &apos;t give me that . stop .
you know , &quot; greetings from dysfunction junction . &quot;
that one can &apos;t go to school because he &apos;s too depressed ,
and this one only goes so she can date her teacher .
all right , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m calling the police .
no , you &apos;re not .
why not ?
because we have a daughter whose reputation
will be ruined just as much as his .
she just got done doing community service last week !
ella , i really think--
no ! stop !
it is hard enough for her to walk through this town .
the bell tower , and then the shovel .
do you really want to subject your daughter
to more police scrutiny ?
do you want to see him get away with this ?
of course not .
but before we pick up our torches and pitchforks ,
let &apos;s take a moment and figure it out .
i want to protect aria .
we raised her to be independent and open @-@ minded ,
and we don &apos;t get to be shocked
if that is now who she is .
mr. fitz ?
hanna . what are you doing here ?
oh , i picked up a birthday cake from the bakery around the corner .
actually , could you please leave that open ?
yeah , sure .
look , i know what &apos;s going down with aria &apos;s parents ,
and ...
i just want to say that the rest of us don &apos;t feel the same way .
two people who love each other that much should be together .
crisis hotline . can i help you ?
yes , we did . how are you today ?
i &apos;m glad you reached out again .
has the situation gotten worse ?
much .
i &apos;m in way too deep .
i had to do something .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have a choice .
we always have choices .
no , no . i should have known better .
i just ... i just got sucked in ,
and it made me feel like ...
like i finally had some power ,
and now i @-@ i just can &apos;t make this go away without ...
that &apos;s lucas !
i never wanted to hurt anybody , but now i have to .
take a breath .
maybe i can help you come up with a solution .
no , there is only one solution ,
and it &apos;s not gonna be pretty .
i know what i have to do .
i just ... hate to do it .
hanna .
this is more important than a perfect bow .
just listen to us .
we both heard the voice .
it was definitely lucas on the other end .
no , you both heard what you wanted to hear .
lucas may be able to get his hands on illegal firecrackers ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s &quot; a &apos;s &quot; evil elf .
hanna , you don &apos;t know that , okay ?
lucas hated alison just as much as jenna did .
she could have easily recruited him .
it wouldn &apos;t take a whole lot of persuasion .
no . he has been an incredible friend to me .
he brought caleb back to town .
he &apos;s now helping me throw this party .
so he can play you . so he can gain your trust .
i mean , for all we know ,
he still sees alison whenever he looks at us .
no , he &apos;s over that .
okay , well , maybe &quot; a &quot; is pressuring lucas
just like &quot; a &quot; did with us .
i mean , if &quot; a &quot; has something on him--
did you record this conversation ?
do you have any other proof ?
no , of course not .
well , then , drop it .
hanna ! it was lucas that was in the greenhouse .
that &apos;s who dropped the phone .
that &apos;s who you hit with your car .
really ?
did you see bruises through the telephone , too ?
lucas has had my back for a long time , okay ?
he may have had an axe to grind with alison ,
but which one of us didn &apos;t ?
hanna .
no . just leave it alone .
he &apos;s too easy of a target .
hello ?
ezra .
you shouldn &apos;t be calling here .
no , i @-@ i know . i really needed to hear your--
i know .
me too .
but you can &apos;t call here anymore .
was she alone ?
was there anybody else in that car going to boston with jenna ?
i have no idea .
that was supposed to be me in that car with her .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
she turned on me , toby .
she does that .
all i ever did was everything she asked me to do ,
and one day , she decides that &apos;s not enough .
when jenna doesn &apos;t need people anymore ,
she gets rid of them .
all i said was , this town is not good for her ,
and i just wish we could get out of here--
y @-@ you know , move on .
maybe she &apos;s having too much fun settling scores .
hey , your stepsister &apos;s been through a lot , all right ?
if it were me and i had to learn everything all over again ,
i &apos;d be curled up in some corner .
she makes the rest of us look like cowards .
i never questioned her strength ,
just how she uses it .
yeah , well , you don &apos;t understand her .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
but it looks like she found some new friends who do .
oh , yeah ?
who are her friends ?
you could just walk away , garrett . i did .
the difference is , i &apos;m in love with her .
and if i have to keep proving that to her ,
i will .
are you sure they &apos;re up here ?
yes . my mom bought , like ,
a zillion tiki torches for my dad &apos;s 40th ,
so they &apos;ve got to be up here somewhere .
so was it worth taking a second shower for ?
what is all this stuff ?
well , the furniture is my nana &apos;s ,
and the spiders , they came with the house .
that &apos;s the food . keep looking , i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
hanna ?
oh , my god .
&quot; a &quot; &apos; s been up here .
hanna , is that you ?
it &apos;s me .
what are you doing here ?
looking for some tools .
why ?
to hang the birthday banner .
yeah , but ... why up here ?
how did you ... even know to come up here ?
i just ... figured they would be stored up here .
you know , some people ...
some people like to store their tools in the attic .
yeah .
we don &apos;t .
did mike need us to pick him up ?
no . gavin &apos;s mom was gonna take him home .
they were gonna stop and get a pizza .
you know what ? we &apos;ll eat somewhere else .
byron .
no , there are other restaurants .
aria , come on , we &apos;re not staying here .
mom .
let &apos;s just go somewhere else .
aria .
aria . come on , we &apos;re walking .
i &apos;m glad you called .
i &apos;m here if you need to speak again .
bye @-@ bye .
did you sign up for an extra shift ?
i could use the help .
no , i &apos;m ... on my way to a birthday party .
but i got your message about a missing transcript page ,
and turns out i did stick it in my folder ,
by accident .
wow , i &apos;m glad you found it .
can i ask you something ?
crisis hotline . can i help you ?
can you speak up , please ?
crisis hotline . can i help you ?
i @-@ i called there yesterday .
were you the person who i spoke to ?
yes .
well ... i &apos;ve made a decision ,
and-- and i &apos;m not waiting .
i have to take care of this tonight .
but i just ...
keep seeing her face
and how hard it &apos;s gonna be ...
to lose her ...
forever .
lucas ! are you up there ?
we will find somewhere .
it &apos;s a small town , byron .
where do you want us to go for a bowl of pasta ,
delaware ?
listen , if you would let me go to the police ,
we could eat anywhere we wanted to .
can we not have that conversation
right here on the town square ?
byron ? ella ?
hey !
hey , ron !
how are you ?
hi .
we thought you guys were still overseas .
oh , yeah , we just got back last week .
the kids have been craving cheesesteaks
ever since we hit the tarmac , so ...
boy , aria , you-- you &apos;ve really grown up !
no . well , apparently not that much .
holden , hey , look who &apos;s here .
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
good .
at least say it in portuguese .
pretend you learned something .
oh , no , he doesn &apos;t have to impress us .
you taught aria how to ride a bike . that &apos;s plenty .
uh ... no , he ... didn &apos;t teach me , actually .
true , i ... broke her training wheels
and then she figured out the rest .
hey , would you guys like to come over for dinner next weekend ?
we can all cook together .
yeah . that &apos;ll give aria and holden
some time to get caught up .
hanna .
hanna !
oh , um , han , did you really order
12 pizzas with green peppers on &apos; em ?
no . why ?
that &apos;s what you got .
