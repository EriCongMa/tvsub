if you were a girl growing up in the &apos; 80s ,
the pajama party was a night of epic adventure .
okay , listen up .
this next decision is , like , super important .
okay . do we watch &quot; adventures in babysitting , &quot;
&quot; pretty in pink , &quot; or &quot; troop beverly hills &quot; ?
&quot; troop beverly hills &quot; !
i was hoping you &apos;d say that !
shelley long has a black belt in shopping !
it &apos;s very funny to me .
oh , my god . this is so fun .
i love you all so much !
* come on down *
* it &apos;s cookie time *
* it &apos;s cookie time *
&quot; troop beverly hills &quot; was the ultimate
girl cult movie .
it had it all --
songs , shopping , and shelley long .
* it &apos;s cookie time *
* it &apos;s cookie time *
my mom loved it , too ,
because the girls were still young enough
to let her join the troop .
and even though erica and her gal pals
got older and cooler ,
they never left their favorite tradition behind .
just heard mark mcgonagle &apos;s throwing a rager saturday night .
he lets the girls do keg stands first .
he &apos;s such a gentleman .
or we do our annual pajama party , make s &apos;mores ,
and recite every word of &quot; troop beverly hills . &quot;
ugh , so lame .
you know you &apos;re dying to do it .
i am .
oh , my god , this is gonna be so fun !
oh , my god , this is gonna be so fun !
no ! take off the mom pajamas
and stop doing what you &apos;re doing .
please let me be your shelley long !
we &apos;ll call it &quot; troop beverly , &quot; just like in the old days .
that &apos;s when we were too young
to know how unbearably annoying you were .
no offense taken . but come on .
your pajama parties are the only reminder i have
of when you were happy , tiny girls
and not godforsaken teenage monsters .
look at me , mom !
there is no troop beverly anymore .
end of story .
dude , did you hear that ?
your sister &apos;s having her hot friends over
for a lingerie party .
pretty sure i heard &quot; pajama . &quot;
bet they &apos;re gonna have pillow fights ,
tickle fights , and other fights we can &apos;t even imagine !
easy , dave kim . that &apos;s my sister .
we can hide your video camera when they &apos;re having their party .
yes !
oh , my god !
again , that &apos;s my sister .
dude , this is our one chance to peek behind the curta
and gain insight into young womanhood .
well , on one hand ,
it &apos;s an unforgivable invasion of privacy .
o @-@ on the other hand , girls are a perplexing mystery ,
and filming them for education purposes
could provide some helpful insight .
let &apos;s do it !
yes !
aw , man !
we &apos;re gonna be the coolest guys in school !
we were not .
it was november 11th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and barry and pops just discovered
willow grove mall had a new store .
holy crap , puppies !
they &apos;re so fluffy and adorable !
they &apos;re like the kittens of dogs !
look ! that one &apos;s falling asleep while standing up .
i &apos;ve done that .
oh , not so fast .
look , i don &apos;t want to sound like your father ,
but you can &apos;t go in there .
you &apos;re deathly allergic to dogs .
why ? !
i know , it &apos;s rough .
but i &apos;ll be at your side in solidarity .
that fuzzy one just sneezed .
i &apos;ll see you in 10 .
my brother &apos;s violent dog allergy
had always been a source of great frustration .
but that day , the lure of cute , cuddly puppies
was too much for barry .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
this thin mesh barrier will protect me .
but as barry stared down into that pit of adorableness ,
he lost his balance and tumbled into furry danger .
oh , god , no ! not puppies !
hold your breath , barry !
i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna die !
they &apos;re so cute , but deadly !
they &apos;re gonna kill me !
uh ... kiddo , y @-@ you seem totally fine .
you &apos;re right . i am !
get on in here , you ! i &apos;m the puppy king !
dad ! you won &apos;t believe it .
i &apos;m alive ! i &apos;m actually alive !
ask your mother .
i spent the entire afternoon
in a puppy pit cheating death .
you always said the reason we can &apos;t get a dog is &apos; cause of me .
forget what happened in the puppy pit .
that was a fluke .
you are crazy allergic to dogs .
wrong !
my insanely strong immune system
has grown so powerful
that i &apos;m no longer allergic to anything on earth .
no . stop . don &apos;t think that .
it &apos;s the truth !
i &apos;ll go outside right now and roll in poison oak .
you &apos;ll see .
i made it up , okay ?
you &apos;re not allergic to dogs .
what ? !
the only reason i said that is because when you were a kid ,
you asked for one every damn day !
do you realize you &apos;ve denied me
the sidekick i &apos;ve always longed for ?
i &apos;m okay with that .
do you know how many times
i had to play frisbee by myself ?
how many times i got caught in a well ?
look , i got enough ungrateful kids
around here to take care of .
the last thing i need
is an ungrateful animal to take care of .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
i &apos;m gonna keep saying it until i get
the four @-@ legged friend i deserve !
give me a dog !
no ! stop asking .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
get me a dog .
no .
give me a dog .
fine !
but if i say yes , promise me you &apos;ll take care of it .
it &apos;s your dog .
yes !
now i &apos;m not the only one in the house
who has to take his pill in cheese !
while barry finally got his wish for a dog ,
me and my crew were getting our greatest wish .
thanks to cutting @-@ edge vhs technology ,
we would learn the secrets of womanhood .
okay . i just snuck a cable from the bedroom to the basement .
fingers crossed , boys .
oh ! yes !
okay , enough ! silence !
dave kim needs to focus .
it &apos;s happening .
today we learn the secrets of womanhood .
this is the best moment of my life .
i love you guys .
* we &apos;re the girls from beverly hills *
* 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 *
* shopping is our greatest skill *
what the hell ? they &apos;re just watching a dumb movie .
come of age already , damn it !
hit each other with pillows !
okay , who wants pizza ro-- oh , my god !
what is happening here ? !
okay , i can totally explain this .
run !
you &apos;re grounded , adam !
and i &apos;m calling your mothers !
in that moment ,
my mother realized she had found a way
into erica &apos;s pajama party , and into her life .
i &apos;ll just watch for a little bit .
and she couldn &apos;t resist .
should i do a loose crimp or a tighter , more intense one ?
tight crimp . tight crimp .
loose .
yeah , no , wh @-@ whatever .
loose is good .
that night ,
my mom had the time of her life
being a secret member of erica &apos;s troop .
... three different girls ,
and then he broke up with heather .
heather g. or heather s. ?
hello , principal ball .
this is your butt doctor calling .
we found a problem . your head was up there .
tell him he &apos;s bald !
so , if you add a white line across the top ,
it &apos;s a french manicure .
well , don &apos;t i just look like zsa zsa gabor .
shi @-@ shi froufrou .
um ... erica ?
what &apos;s that ?
someone &apos;s dead !
fudgy , fudgy , fudge !
fudgy , fudge ...
are you spying on our pajama party ? !
before you say anything , i got to know ,
is it heather g. or heather s. ?
i don &apos;t even know what to say !
you have never , ever stooped so low !
i have . you just haven &apos;t caught me .
shut up and listen .
i &apos;ve narrowed down the exact breed of dog
that best matches my personality and lifestyle .
good morning to you , too .
our dog will either be the kind that looks like a sheep ...
sheepdog ....
a cujo ...
book , not a breed ...
a mcgruff ...
that &apos;s a cartoon crime dog .
... or a bear crossed with a poodle .
not possible .
surprise , surprise !
look who &apos;s back from the dog pound !
whoa , whoa , wait ! you got a dog without me ?
it better be a grizzly @-@ poodle .
seriously . if it &apos;s not a grizzoodle , i don &apos;t want it .
it &apos;s this thing .
erica , come see how sweet and not awful i am !
he &apos;s perfect !
he is a she ,
and you owe me 8 bucks for shots and gas .
okay , okay . she needs a name .
from this point on ,
this animal will only be known as jean dog van damme .
no , wait !
arnold schwarzendogger .
no , wait ! dog vester stallone .
no , wait !
lucky .
erica , come meet lucky .
it &apos;s a perfect name , &apos; cause she &apos;s so lucky
to live with a family that &apos;s so loving and forgiving .
getting a dog doesn &apos;t change my mind
that you &apos;re a garbage mom .
but that doesn &apos;t mean
i can &apos;t give this sweetie petey some lovey wubbies !
yes , i will !
yes , i will !
everyone &apos;s happy but me .
seems right .
and so barry finally got his doggy sidekick .
or so he thought .
there you are , girl !
come on ! it &apos;s time to train !
i thought we &apos;d skip &quot; sit &quot; and go to the important stuff ,
like how to grind some rails and solve crimes .
will you be quiet ? i &apos;m trying to watch the game .
just take the thing and go .
whoa ! easy , girl .
maybe you should just give her a little space .
please .
does that look like the face of a dog
who doesn &apos;t utterly worship her master ?
yeah , yeah . he &apos;s a moron .
just settle down .
ooh . that &apos;s nice and toasty .
you know , she &apos;s clearly tired .
get some rest , lucky .
i &apos;ll teach you how to karate chop a board
with your paws tomorrow .
toasty .
as my dad warmed up to the dog ,
erica pulled out the big guns
and gave my mom the cold shoulder .
there &apos;s favorite daughter .
how was school , squishy ?
oh , now it &apos;s the silent treatment , huh ?
fine .
i &apos;ll wait for you to come around .
okay , look , i know what i did was wrong ,
but i had no choice .
you completely cut me out of your life !
invasive spy cams are all i got .
okay , this is ridiculous .
you forgive me right now
and let me hug your body or you &apos;re grounded .
okay . now i &apos;ll talk .
if anyone here is grounded , it &apos;s you .
you can &apos;t ground me , i &apos;m your mother .
i just did . you &apos;re grounded from my life .
you &apos;re not allowed to participate in it ever again .
you know what , i &apos;ve had enough .
you want me out of your life ? you got it .
we &apos;ll see how you do without me for a week .
you know that isn &apos;t a punishment , right ?
oh , we &apos;ll see .
and when you come crawling back ,
begging for your mother &apos;s help and guidance ,
we both know what &apos;ll happen then .
you &apos;ll scoop me up in your arms .
and smother you with kisses !
deal with that , sucka !
it wasn &apos;t like my dad to want a dog ...
until he met the dog that was just like him .
what the hell is lucky wearing ?
did you make my dog an eagles jersey ?
sure did .
you put effort into something ?
can you believe it ? !
and look what i put on the back .
instead of jaworski , i put &quot; paworski . &quot;
&apos;cause it has paws .
because it &apos;s a dog .
not cool !
dad &apos;s turned the dog against me !
this was my dream , and --
dude , what do you got there ?
i &apos;m making a dog puppet arm
for when lucky needs to grab stuff in my home movies .
i &apos;m gonna make &quot; turner &amp; hooch , &quot; but watchable .
you can &apos;t direct lucky .
your terrible changing voice
will hurt her sensitive dog ears .
besides , i can &apos;t even get her away from dad
to play frisbee with me . this is bullcrap !
dad hasn &apos;t turned lucky against you .
the dog just listens to him &apos; cause he &apos;s the alpha male .
the wha ?
the boss . numero uno .
lucky has to follow dad . it &apos;s nature .
nature is an idiot .
i &apos;m number uno .
in lucky &apos;s eyes ,
you &apos;re ranked number four in this family .
no way !
clearly dad &apos;s one .
pops is an elder , so that makes him two .
i have a power alliance with pops ,
so that puts me at three and you at four .
four ? !
that &apos;s the copper medal of the olympics !
only one thing left to do .
i shall challenge dad to a showdown
and become the alpha !
it &apos;s okay , barry .
good barry .
good barry . good barry .
stop !
as barry was ready to challenge my dad ,
my mom was ready for erica
to admit that a few days without her were impossible .
and there it is , the one thing i know you can &apos;t resist --
my seven @-@ meat meatloaf .
i knew you &apos;d give in .
thanks , but i &apos;ll eat at lainey &apos;s .
got to study for mid @-@ terms .
woof , must be tough not having your mom there
to help you hit the books this week , huh ?
actually , this week &apos;s been pretty good .
look into your heart and tell me the truth .
no , you &apos;re right . this week &apos;s been pretty great .
stop .
you haven &apos;t missed my back scratches ?
no .
how i lay on your sheets to warm them up before bedtime ?
god , no .
the love notes i write you on the steamy shower door ?
no .
the way i suck out the pits of your olives .
no !
just admit you learned your lesson .
life is worse without your mama .
i &apos;m sorry , but this week has proven that i &apos;m an adult
and i can take care of myself .
i don &apos;t have all the facts ,
but i think this one goes in the &quot; lost &quot; column .
this is the worst thing to happen to me
since adam learned to walk .
my god .
i can &apos;t believe how easy it is to sneak downtown
when you don &apos;t have a mom in your life .
yeah . mine &apos;s been gone since i was 12 .
it &apos;s the best .
so , where are the tickets ?
what tickets ?
i thought we &apos;d buy some from a scalper .
isn &apos;t that really , really illegal ?
definitely .
hey , dude , you got any tickets ?
yeah . 10th row center .
you interested ?
hells yeah we are .
hells yeah you aren &apos;t .
oh , no . oh , god .
you got i.d. ?
i do have i.d.
is it a fake i.d. ?
you know what , just arrest us .
this isn &apos;t gonna get any better .
as erica sank to rock bottom ,
barry was about to make his move to the top of the heap .
murray terrence goldberg ,
i challenge you to feats of strength .
terrence ?
do you actually think that &apos;s my middle name ?
silence !
prepare to engage in a wrestling match
so the dog can bear witness to my true dominance .
put on this mexican fighting mask .
no . then take off your shirt .
i &apos;m not gonna wrestle you with or without clothing .
fine !
then lucky will recognize me as the alpha
after i launch heavy items into the air
using pure power and brute strength .
it &apos;s slipping ! no ! look away , lucky !
why isn &apos;t this working ?
i &apos;m lifting with my back like you &apos;re supposed to !
okay , stop with the lifting .
look , it &apos;s not my fault the dog hangs around me .
we just get each other .
oh , my god .
you love her !
do not .
there &apos;s actual love in your heart ,
and you &apos;re using it for the dog .
i do not love the dog .
fine .
then you won &apos;t care if i return her .
where &apos;s the receipt ?
she &apos;s family ! you can &apos;t return family !
believe me , i &apos;ve checked .
fine . then from now on her name is traitor .
don &apos;t do that .
come here , traitor .
do not call her traitor .
that &apos;s a goody @-@ woody little traitor .
don &apos;t use a baby voice to call her traitor !
then admit you love her !
you know what , we don &apos;t need this crap .
come on , luckster . let &apos;s go for a walk .
as barry realized he &apos;d been replaced by a dog ,
erica and lainey were realizing they were in deep trouble .
you get one phone call . make it count .
yes . one call .
no @-@ brainer . we &apos;re calling your mom .
no way !
i told her i could live my life without her .
you &apos;re in jail . you clearly can &apos;t .
it took me 16 years to get to this position .
i can &apos;t go back .
well , call someone .
hello ?
hey . is pops there ?
i &apos;m studying , and i have a question about world war ...
i or ii or whatever one he was in .
hold on .
hi , sweetheart . what &apos;s doing ?
i &apos;m in major trouble and mom will kill me ,
so just act normal .
okey dokey , smokey .
that doesn &apos;t sound normal . that sounds crazy !
yes siree , sir , indeedy @-@ doo !
just don &apos;t talk .
okey dokey .
just come to the police station downtown .
i know you lost your license
and will need to steal a car , but i need you .
so if you &apos;ll help , just say , &quot; america won the war . &quot;
america won the war !
and just like that ,
pops floored it to erica &apos;s rescue .
evening , officer .
pull over now .
any idea how fast you were driving ?
50 ?
3 .
53 ?
just 3 .
well , that sounds very safe .
it &apos;s not . can i see your license ?
sure thing , officer . it &apos;s right down here .
kiss my grits , porky !
you &apos;re still in park .
i @-@ in my defense ,
i haven &apos;t driven in two years ...
&apos;cause i have no license .
pops , thank god you &apos;re here !
i &apos;m in really big trouble , erica !
call your mother !
my sister had set out to prove
she could live life without my mom .
and she failed miserably .
don &apos;t you two worry . we &apos;ll be fine .
no matter what happens , we got each other &apos;s back .
mr. solomon , you &apos;re free to go .
pops out !
mom , seriously ? !
what about us ?
yeah , do that thing where you scream
and dig into the officer &apos;s personal life
so much that he sets us free .
she only does that for people who want her in their life .
no silent treatment ! that &apos;s my thing .
you know what she wants to hear .
fine !
i need you in my life .
she didn &apos;t hear you .
i need you in my stupid life !
she wants to know if you mean it .
you &apos;re not just saying it because you &apos;re in prison .
sure , there &apos;s that .
but you &apos;re my mom .
of course i mean it .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going to the concert now , right ?
she says , &quot; god , no . &quot;
right .
can we talk ?
look , i &apos;m no longer gonna demand you be my sidekick .
i know i &apos;m not the alpha
or the beta .
i &apos;m whatever comes last in the greek letters .
i think it &apos;s zorbo .
see , ever since i was a little boy ,
i wanted a dog like you .
not &apos; cause you could jet @-@ ski
or break @-@ dance or deflect grenades with your paws .
i just wanted a friend .
and i didn &apos;t have many growing up .
but i do now . and a hot girlfriend .
so i guess i don &apos;t need you as much as i used to .
but my dad , he could use a cool friend like you .
dude &apos;s a pretty cool guy once you get to know him .
so , we cool ?
right . you can &apos;t talk .
you can &apos;t talk , right ?
the dog can &apos;t talk , barry .
hey , that was a private conference
between me and traitor .
look , i &apos;m not the alpha .
but the dog always sits right next to you .
that &apos;s because of the scraps .
there &apos;s all sorts of tasty shrapnel flying around here .
here .
give her a try .
she likes me !
of course she does .
you &apos;re a likeable kid .
so , does this mean we can share the dog ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t care .
come on . say it . say you love her .
she &apos;s fine .
say it !
she &apos;s fine .
you love the dog .
i love the dog !
me too .
that day , we opened our hearts to a new family member .
and erica opened her heart to my mom .
smells yummy . since when do you bake ?
just felt like cookie time .
what &apos;s all this ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
even though i &apos;m grown up
and i don &apos;t need you ...
i still do .
i always will .
after everything i did , you still bailed me out .
so , i thought i &apos;d finally give you
the pajama party that you deserve .
oh , honey .
so , what do you say ?
troop beverly ?
troop beverly .
and in the end it was all worth it .
not only did my mom and sister start a new tradition ,
but my dad , barry , and their new sidekick did , too .
because that &apos;s what makes a family great .
yes !
oh , yeah !
it &apos;s not just the big moments . it &apos;s the simple things .
like cheering on your favorite team ,
roasting marshmallows ,
or finding out the people you &apos;ve been keeping at a distance
are actually the people you &apos;re closest to .
so , tell me the truth .
was it heather g. or heather s. ?
heather t.
no !
yeah .
&quot; luck tin tin , &quot; take one .
hey , kid ! give me your money !
hey , who are you ?
luck tin tin !
save me !
luck tin tin , attack !
oh , yeah ! luck tin tin !
oh , no ! no !
no ! no ! don &apos;t hurt me !
hey , who are you ?
give me your money --
no ! no , get away !
luck tin tin !
save me !
luck tin tin , help me ! help ! lucky !
