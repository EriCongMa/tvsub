That's a...
Nail.
It's embedded several inches into his frontal lobe.
You know, I'm at an increased risk of having a seizure.
So is this something you do now?
You get high?
Noah has a medical marijuana card.
I took some of Jesus' ADHD pills.
That's like taking speed. Are you crazy?
I can't believe you're still seeing Nick!
What does it matter
if he thinks that I'm his girlfriend
as long as he's locked up?
Callie's caused Brandon a lot of trouble
from the time she showed up.
And what about this Aaron kid?
Is she yanking his chain too?
Hey, anybody home? Police.
You heard gunshots. You were amped on adrenaline
and I was lying on the ground.
Of course you thought that he still had the gun.
But he didn't.
I'm gonna talk to Robert today, change my statement.
They're gonna think you're lying to cover my ass!
There was other DNA on the murder weapon
besides Martha Johnson's and Kyle's.
Why did Kyle's lawyers never see this?
Because detective Gray didn't want him to.
Detective Joe Gray.
I understand you're interested in an old case of mine.
If we can place another suspect at Martha Johnson's house
on the day she was murdered, then we might get a judge
to order them to give a DNA sample.
Like our curb painter Doug Harvey.
I want to go to Juilliard
more than anything.
Promise me that you will not hold back
on this audition because you feel
that you have an obligation to this girl.
Do you have any idea what it takes to study here?
What do I do then? Break up with her?
So Rita called me and she's up in Sacramento
talking to like, representatives and stuff,
and the good news is that Justina's bill died
before it even made it to a vote.
That's because of you, Callie.
Yeah, but...
so apparently, they've got like, a ballot measure.
You know, when they put something out to the voters.
Like they did with prop 8?
Yeah, exactly.
So they're calling it the Foster Care Reform bill,
but, you know, of course it's just the same terrible law
that puts most of government funding towards privatization.
They're relentless, aren't they?
Yeah, and of course people are gonna vote
for something called "Foster Care Reform."
Yeah. I mean, it sounds good to me.
Exactly, and the only way to get voters to see
that there's, you know, a better way to do things
is to put a different bill on the ballot,
and they're calling it Jack's Law.
Oh.
That way, voters can at least... see the difference?
Yeah?
Sounds like a good idea.
Maybe the bills just cancel each other out?
Even that would be better than
Justina getting her law passed.
So, they need 500,000 signatures
to get the new bill on the ballot,
So I was thinking
since we're all already going to the Bayfest
to see brandon's big reunion with Someone's Little Sister...
what if we had like a booth
and, you know, like, collected signatures
and... and took donations?
There's gonna be a ton of people there.
Can I go? I... I mean, I know I'm grounded,
but it's not like Noah's gonna be there, so.
You're not grounded from family things.
Of course you can go.
Uh, hey, Mama?
Where's my refill? I'm almost out.
They haven't sent it yet?
No.
Uh, okay. I will call them tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
What?
I... I got an email from... from Juilliard.
And?
Open it. Open it, love.
I... I...
What... where are you going?
Where is he going?
What?
W... Why isn't he doing anything?
Oh, my God!
oh, my God!
I... I got in!
I got in! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I got into...
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Let me see, let me see!
Come on! Okay, here.
I... I didn't read it all. I... I couldn't read it all.
Oh, my God! Look at you!
Can't believe he did it.
You know? It's one of those things that
you talk about for years and years and years,
and then it finally happens, and... and...
I have to find a way to pay for it.
We will.
And I'm sure he's gonna get a really good aid package.
Yes, and hopefully I will make detective,
so that will take some of the pressure off too, right?
Honey, I don't want you to do that just for the money.
I'm not, I swear.
I... I do really enjoy this line of work, all right?
and... and to be quite honest,
it's time.
You know, it's long past time for me to get off the beat.
Well, I know I'm gonna sleep better.
I know, love.
Me too, you know, if for no other reason
than I won't have to be on my feet all day,
so hopefully my... my knees won't hurt all the time,
and... and...
won't have to put on that damn uniform anymore.
Hey, what's the matter with the uniform?
It has been an honor to wear it everyday
for the past 20 years, but it's... it's polyblend
and it's hot and it's incredibly unattractive.
It'd be fine with me if I never saw it again.
Never?
Oh my.
You have the right to remain silent.
Do I?
And you better start...
right now.
Okay.
And after 20 years on the beat,
I think that, uh, I think I finally realized that my talents
would probably be put to better use elsewhere, so.
Well, you know what? I think you're right.
We're always looking for more female detectives,
and to find someone with your experience and commitment,
well, we'd be lucky to have you.
Thank you.
Of course, I've gotta run it up the ladder, but
Yes.
I think everything looks very good.
And it doesn't hurt that you've already got
a recommendation from one of our most decorated veterans.
Someone put in a recommendation for me?
Yeah. Gray.
Joe Gray.
I figured you knew him, asked him to.
Yeah, I know him. Yup.
And in the end, if so many people had to die,
维吉尔
well, that was just a byproduct of our hero's journey.
The Romans were pretty merciless that way.
Okay, more on this tomorrow.
Make sure you've done your reading.
Mariana, a word?
Yeah?
So...
I read your paper.
It's not your best work.
I expect a lot more from you.
Oh, my god.
I... I've just...
I've been so busy with robotics,
I've gotten so far behind.
I'm just... I'm just trying to catch up.
You had the same time as everyone else.
Please, if... if you can,
can I just have this weekend to make it better?
I... I promise I will fix it. Please. It's just...
this will ruin my GPA.
Okay.
But I want it Monday. First thing.
And it better be good.
Okay.
Hello?
Hey. It's me.
Um, I've got some good news.
What?
I'm home.
You are?
Well, I mean, just for the weekend.
They've got me on house arrest, so...
I can't leave.
That must be nice, to be home for a little bit.
Yeah, it is.
And you know the best part?
You can come over.
I can finally touch you again.
Bad interview?
No, great interview, in fact.
Got a big, fancy detective puttin' in a good word for me.
Gray sent over a recommendation.
The hell is that?
Does he think that he can just buy me, buy my silence?
I'm just gonna owe him, be his bitch?
He obviously doesn't know you very well.
So, I mean, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna take yourself out of the running?
No.
That's evidence that Benjamin Torres was 14 years old
when Molloy molested him.
Give that to your friend in Vice
and tell him that
Gray threatened to have Benjamin's parents deported.
See what he can do with it.
Okay. Are you sure you want to do this?
It sounds like Gray is keeping an eye on you.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I missed you.
I'm so glad... You're home.
Where are you going?
You fell asleep.
No, I didn't.
It's okay.
I'm sorry. I just...
I haven't been sleeping like, at all.
Hello. Just wanted to make sure everyone was decent in here.
Don't worry.
Okay. Oh, Mat, congratulations, by the way.
On what?
Getting into Berklee.
Very happy for you.
Thanks.
You got into Berklee?
I didn't even know you applied there.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's no big deal.
I... I don't even know if I want to go.
You should probably take a nap.
Call me later if you want.
So...
What do you have for me?
Whatever it is, give it to me quick.
Uh, this place is giving me flashbacks to high school.
Is this a hint?
Are you trying to tell me something?
It's from Doug Harvey.
The curb painter?
Yeah.
Did you break into his house?
Callie, what the hell? You could have gotten yourself killed.
Well, I didn't, so now we can see
if Harvey's DNA matches anything on the murder weapon.
No, we can't. It's not admissible.
What's the point? Not to mention the fact
that you broke a bunch of laws to get it.
Okay, what was I supposed to do?
No, if you could have heard Kyle
when he told me that they were sending him to Folsom early....
I'm telling you, if we can't figure out
how to give him some hope at least...
he's gonna...
Okay, um...
We'll get it tested.
At least we'll know.
As long as you promise not to do anything stupid again.
Okay.
Callie, I'm serious.
What?
Nothing.
What?
I said nothing.
Was it Nick?
Jesus!
Whoa, he's home?
You can't go see him.
Yeah, I know!
I'm serious.
Mariana, you can't go see him.
I'm not going to. God.
Well, then text him.
I will.
Yeah?
Do it now.
No, I'll do it later.
No, you won't.
Yes, I will, jesus!
I'll do it as soon as I'm done with this stupid paper!
Now leave me alone!
Okay.
See now, no sooner do I try and help you out
you go and make me regret it.
Nobody asked for your help.
Too high a price as far as I can see.
All I did was ask you to stay out of it.
And I did.
Handing over evidence to the guys in Vice
doesn't seem like staying out of it to me.
So making detective, that's not worth anything to you?
Not this.
What about having a job at all?
Keep talking.
Give me more to go to internal affairs with.
It's funny you should mention IA.
I was thinking they'd be very interested
in finding out how you tried to cover for your ex-partner.
Or was it your ex-husband?
No, wait, it's both,
when he was being investigated for shooting an unarmed man.
That's one thing about IA.
They hate being lied to.
You're not the only one
who could do a little digging, officer.
You have a good night now.
帮助前寄养孩子获得新判决
Okay.
You're raising money for Kyle too?
I thought it couldn't hurt.
Wow, nice location, Callie.
I think we could do some damage from here, huh?
Um, where do you want this?
Uh, just across the back. Thanks.
Hey, AJ, come give me a hand.
Hey! Oh, I love them!
Thank you so much for doing this!
Of course.
Yes!
Wow. There... there's two of you.
That's... crazy.
Um, I'm gonna go grab the rest of the chairs.
Okay, who is that? He was cute.
Oh, that is Aaron.
You know, the intern I told you about
from the Juvenile Justice Center.
Oh, so he's smart too.
Nice!
Hey, Jude, I...
Hey, what's up with Callie and that guy?
Nothing.
Why are you asking me that?
Just looking out for you.
Look, Mike, I know you don't like Callie.
Okay? But I do,
and I'm gonna keep seeing her.
And if you don't want me to keep seeing her,
well, that's too bad.
I'm gonna be 18 soon, and if you don't want me
staying under your roof anymore, I guess...
I'll just move on.
Did-- did your sister tell you that I was home?
You want to come in?
Look, Mariana doesn't want to say this to you
because she doesn't want to, you know, hurt your feelings
I guess, but...
She doesn't want to be with you anymore.
She's with Mat now,
so you have to leave her alone.
Okay?
Why didn't she tell me this herself?
Because she's afraid of you.
So we're calling it Jack's Law
for my friend who was killed in the system.
Uh, so we just need enough signatures
to get the bill on the ballot.
I was a foster kid,
so believe me, it's really important.
Oh, we already signed the foster care petition.
You did?
Yeah, about an hour ago over by the entrance.
That's weird.
We just got here.
Yeah, I know.
Or maybe they just didn't want to sign.
Yeah, maybe.
So there's this other bill
that like, puts all the money into like,
businesses instead of for the kids,
but we're trying to fight that, so maybe you could sign?
Um, I don't think so.
I gotta meet my friends.
Sorry.
Couldn't close, huh?
帮帮这个曾被寄养的孩子
Thank you. Thanks.
Hi, are you interested in foster care reform?
We just, uh, we need some signatures
to get our bill on the ballot.
Uh, yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Would you also consider donating to help
Kyle Snow get a fair trial?
He was wrongly convicted of murder.
No, I won't.
Okay.
You know, you shouldn't be doing that.
You're raising money for a murderer.
Okay, well, he's not a murderer--
Yes.
He is.
I'm Troy Johnson.
Martha was my grandmother.
See, a friend of mine called me this morning
to tell me about this, and I didn't believe it.
You have to stop.
I just got my mother back
after years of her being so depressed,
she couldn't even get out of bed.
I'm sure this has been really hard for you all,
but Kyle is a victim here too, okay?
He did not do this.
Yes, he did.
No, he didn't. The detective on your grandmother's case
made sure that he was convicted
even though there was evidence
that points to somebody else, okay?
Don't you want the person that's responsible to be found?
Look, Kyle is guilty.
I know that, and so did the jury.
And I'm sorry if you have convinced yourself
of some cockamamie theory,
but please let this go.
For my family's sake.
Hi there. Can we talk to you for a minute
about foster care reform?
Okay, this is so frustrating.
What is going on? Why aren't you working the crowd?
You're much better at harassing people than I am.
I, uh...
Detective Gray came to visit me
as I was leaving work yesterday.
Again?
Yeah,
and he, uh, threatened to go to IA
if I didn't drop the whole thing.
He knows about how I covered for Mike after the shooting.
How does he know about that?
I have no idea.
Does this mean you could lose your job?
Honey,
you don't have to make detective.
That's fine. We're gonna be fine.
But if you lose your job...
You have to let this go.
Hey, listen, there's a child molester
still out on those streets thanks to Detective Gray.
And an innocent kid is sitting,
rotting away his life in jail.
How am I supposed to walk away from that?
There are other people who can take this on.
Well... let the JJC handle it.
Isn't that what they're there for?
They're not gonna get justice for Benjamin Torres, Lena.
They're not.
This is an issue of integrity for me, Lena.
Why can't you see that?
You-- you are the one
who's always saying that we can't save them all.
And you know what? Sometimes you have to...
You have to compromise your integrity.
It sucks, but it's true.
You do what you have to do for the sake of your family.
Excuse me, uh, can I talk to you
for a second about, uh, foster care reform?
Hi, do you have a moment to talk about foster care--
Do you have a moment to talk about serious reforms
needed in the foster system?
Sure.
My team and I are collecting signatures
to get a really important bill on the ballot
and would...
Wait a minute, I know you, don't I?
I mean, Berkeley? That's eight hours away,
and he didn't even tell me he was going to apply,
and it's because he knew
that I was going to be upset. That's why.
At least it's not one of those
schools that he was looking at on the east coast.
And my grandparents live nearby, so I can visit,
and-- and-- it's-- it's just a year, right?
Are you... okay?
No.
Maybe. I don't know. I'm gonna get these guys.
Excuse me.
Are you familiar with Jack's Law?
Uh, we're trying to get another reform bill placed on the ballot.
So Justina's people are here too.
For real?
Yeah.
Guess we weren't the only ones with the brilliant idea
of getting signatures here.
But I am not going to let them have the upper hand.
I'm going to work harder and I need a new petition.
Already?
Damn, that is impressive.
But of course, if we were all as cute as you,
I'm sure we'd be on our fourth petition too.
Are you serious right now?
I'm standing right here.
What?
You know what. Stop hitting on my girlfriend, man.
I know you kissed her.
And I've been trying to be chill with you,
but every time I turn around, you're making moves.
Aj--
Stay in your lane, man.
For real.
Aj, he's just playing.
Well, that's enough playing.
Does he always get this worked up?
Seriously?
You really want to start something with me?
You're about half my size on a good day, little man.
I will break you, so watch your damn mouth.
Okay, okay, you know what, um...
Aaron, he has a point, okay?
And you need to stop pressing people's buttons...
Thank you.
But you need to shut the hell up
and stop being such a jerk.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
Oh, good! Yeah, yeah, yeah, great!
I'm sure you think that I've created all this drama,
that I'm just yanking everyone's chain, right?
Callie, I don't know--
No, Mike.
It's actually none of your business
and I don't care what you think,
so you need to stay the hell out of it, okay?
Dammit. Aaron!
What was that?
Come on, Mike. You always blame her for everything.
What?
It's not fair, and you know it.
Aj, I have nothing against Callie personally.
I-- I'm just-- I worry.
Look, let's be clear about one thing.
You're family.
Hey, you're not going anywhere no matter how I feel
about your love life.
Okay? You always have a home with me.
Hey, can we stop soon? I'm starving.
We just had lunch.
Excuse me, sir?
Would you sign our petition for foster care reform?
Some people are weird.
No kidding.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me, would you two--
You got what you wanted.
Aaron went home.
Good.
You are such a jackass.
How am I the jackass here, Callie?
You're the one that pulled away from me
when I tried to kiss you this morning.
And then you went and comforted him
after all those shots he took at me.
Okay, I didn't pull away because of Aaron,
I pulled away 'cause Mike was there.
And yeah, I-- I went after him because of what you said.
It was so shady.
What? I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
Calling him out for his size,
obviously he's sensitive about that.
Well, obviously I'm sensitive
about some dude hitting on my girlfriend.
Okay, Aaron is trans, AJ.
God.
How--
Anybody want to sign for Jack's Law?
Anybody?
Jack's Law?
I'll sign.
I-- I, uh...
You're not...
I'm-- I'm not...
not supposed to see you.
I won't tell if you won't.
So, you know, I was thinking,
and Berkeley isn't so bad.
I mean, it's not ideal, but it's not that far
and they've got a really good robotics program,
so I was thinking maybe I could apply next year--
I'm pretty sure Berkeley doesn't have a robotics program.
Yes, it does. I-- I looked it up.
It's a really good one, in fact.
Pretty sure Berklee College of Music
doesn't have a robotics program.
Berklee College of Music? Where is that?
Boston.
Come on. We're up soon.
Callie?
So I called Justina Marks.
You know her, right?
Yeah.
Well, to tell her how well we were doing
and how weird it was that there's this
whole other group collecting signatures here,
and, well, she asked me to pass along a little message.
She told me to tell you that opening people's mail
is a federal offense.
I didn't--
Well, she knows you posted
a picture of the check she got online, so...
pack up, go home, and stop all this
or she's gonna have you arrested.
So, uh, listen, I handled the whole Nick thing.
What?
What do you mean you handled it?
What-- what did you do?
I-- I went to see him, and, um--
You went to see him?
Yeah, and we talked
Man to man, and I-- I made it clear
that you're not his girlfriend anymore, that you're with Mat,
and you don't ever want to see him again.
Oh, my god, why did you do that?
You're so stupid!
Now he's gonna be mad at me
and I'm gonna have to-- I--
Mariana, it's-- it's okay. It's gonna be fine.
You're fine.
You don't know that.
Hey, what's going on?
I can't do this. I--
Can't do what?
Just any of it.
I can't...
keep trying to help people,
and just have it blow up in my face again. I can't.
It's hard to help people sometimes.
You know, it's hard to do the right thing,
and sometimes people get hurt, sometimes you get hurt.
But it's no excuse though.
you gotta keep doing what you're doing.
And you're doing a great job, you hear me?
Hey, can I go up with you guys?
Um, on stage? Why?
Captain Roberts, this is Stefanie Adams-Foster.
Um, I want to leave this on
your voicemail so that I don't change my mind.
I'd like to see you on Monday.
Something I'd like to take to IA.
Hey, how's everyone doin'?
Sorry, I-- I know everyone's here to see some music,
and the amazing Someone's Little Sister is about to play.
I just want to take a few seconds to talk
about my friend Jack Downey.
He was let down by the foster care system
and died because of abuse in an unsafe home.
Uh, and I'm here today because I want to make sure
that his death was not in vain.
See, there's two different bills circulating today,
and one of them is sponsored by the people
that are directly responsible for Jack's death.
So, I just-- I'm asking you, please,
please take one minute from your day today
to help us get Jack's Law on the ballot this fall.
Thank you.
And now, Someone's Little Sister.
Thank you. We're Someone's Little Sister.
Uh, well, some of us are.
Our keyboardist is actually on a little vacation right now,
So we asked our old friend, Brandon Foster, to join us.
And, uh, Brandon actually just got some really exciting news.
He will be attending Juilliard this fall.
I think he deserves a round of applause for that, yeah?
In honor of this most momentous achievement,
uh, we wanted to play a song that he just wrote.
It's called Collateral Damage.
It's work.
Hey, Monty, why are you calling me on a Saturday?
What's going on?
Hey, uh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I'm gonna step away and call you back.
He's here.
Who? Who's here?
Nick.
Okay, where are you?
Mariana.
Uh, I'm... I'm by the bathroom.
Mariana, what's going on?
Mariana!
I... I gotta...
Hey, sorry about that.
So what's going on?
Let me. I'll check inside.
Okay.
Hello?
Hey, are you here?
Are you at Bayfest?
What?
Listen, are you at Bayfest?
Did you come here looking for Mariana?
I have an ankle bracelet, dude.
I can't leave.
She's not in there.
Then where the hell is she?
Wait, what's going on?
Hey, what's going on?
I think that she might be taking your pills again.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you... what do you mean "again"?
Have... have you seen Mariana?
Uh, no, babe. Not for a while. Why?
Because we can't find her anywhere.
And...
And, um, she might
have taken some of my pills.
Look, I... I didn't know anything about it,
but I'm worried because she called me and she said that she...
she thinks she sees Nick here.
N... Nick here? How could he possibly be here?
Listen, I'm sorry.
I just...
You should have told me about Aaron before.
I mean, I wouldn't have gotten so jealous.
Why? 'Cause he's trans?
That's a very ignorant thing to say.
What?
Aaron is no less of a man than you are,
and just 'cause he's trans,
that would never stop me from seeing him.
Okay, so do you want to date him?
No, that's not what I said.
I mean that I would consider it
if I weren't seeing you.
Well, maybe you shouldn't be then.
What?
Seeing me.
Hey, have you seen Mariana?
No.
Okay.
Why were you in my house?
Excuse me?
Why were you in my house?
Why are you watching me?
I haven't. I...
I'm not... I'm not. I'm not watching you.
I don't even know who you are.
Don't lie to me because I saw you.
I'm not...
I saw you. I know you're watching me.
I'm not watching you. I don't know who you are.
Don't lie to me.
Okay, if you could just let me...
What's going on here?
Hey. Have you... anything?
No. No, no, no.
We've looked everywhere. We've been all over this place.
Okay. Uh...
Okay, hold it right there.
Excuse me, my name is Stef Adams-Foster.
I'm a police officer with the sixth precinct.
I have reason to believe that my daughter is missing.
She is 5'2, she's Latina...
Attention all officers,
We have a bolo for Nick Stratos.
Be on the lookout for Nick Stratos.
18, sandy brown hair.
I repeat, we have a bolo for Nick Stratos.
Parolee cut off his ankle bracelet and is on the run.
He's out on early parole.
What?
Uh, I just got a call.
The, uh, the college board,
they flagged that Tristan kid when he took the SATs again
and he scored so much lower.
Uh, and?
And, um...
He told them... he told them everything,
including your name.
What does... what does that mean?
It means you... you're not going to Juilliard.
Okay.
Oh, hey. You all right?
Uh, yeah.
Hey, look, I'm sorry about before.
It's, um...
just been kind of hard.
No, I understand.
Actually, um...
I think my sister's missing.
Uh, she's Latina, uh, really short,
Um, she has a #justice4jack shirt on.
Have you seen her?
Uh, dark hair?
Yeah.
Pretty girl?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I actually did see her get into a car
just a little bit ago.
Um, do you want to...
I mean, I think if we hurry, we could probably...
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
Yeah, sure.
Mariana, get in the car.
Come on. Hey, it's okay.
Just get in the car.
No, leave me alone!
No, you can't. You... you broke in to my house!
You had a gun!
I know, I know, I'm sorry, okay?
Just please, please...
No! You don't get to touch me!
You hurt me! You scared me! You...
I know, I know just...
You made me afraid in my own bedroom!
You... you were gonna...
No, I... I was never gonna hurt you!
You were gonna kill yourself!
Please! I... I'm sorry!
Just come with me please!
I don't love you, Nick!
Stop! You don't get to do that!
You don't get to do something like that
and then just be with me!
I never want to see you again!
They couldn't have gotten too much further.
Hey, so, uh, I just got a call from the JJC.
They got the DNA report back.
And?
And Harvey is not a match.
Oh.
But there was more DNA on the murder weapon
besides Kyle's.
They can't ID it,
but it's from someone related to Martha.
A man.
It's okay, Mariana.
I'm okay.
I understand that you don't want to see me anymore,
and I understand why.
I'm sorry I ever scared you like that.
There! There! Stop the car!
Stop it! Let me out!
Hey! What did you do to her?
Jesus! Whoa! Jesus...
Stop, stop, stop...
Jesus, stop!
Jesus!
Stop...
Jesus, stop, stop.
Oh, my god! Jesus!
Jesus, honey, can you hear me?
Call 911. What did you do?!
Buddy, baby, are you okay?
Jesus, talk to me, honey.
