there was no sign saying i couldn &apos;t sit in that area .
i just need to know what the problem was back there .
the problem was i &apos;m black .

i need you to calm down .

no , you &apos;re under arrest .
what ? i @-@ i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
put your hands behind your back .
please take your hands off me .
put your hands behind your back .
hey , i did nothing wrong , all right ?

oh , now you &apos;re gonna shoot me ?
i said ...
for what ? for ...
no , don &apos;t do it .
no !
no ! oh , my god !
you &apos;re killing me .
cole !
tonight , a jury continues to hear evidence
about the death of cole willis .
willis &apos; death at the hands of two police officers ,
michael and trenton , places chicago
on a growing list of cities protesting racial injustice
by local law enforcement .
you &apos;ll definitely be asked about this .
are these two cops guilty of , you know ,
involuntary manslaughter ?
well , i can &apos;t comment on it-- the trial &apos;s still going on .
it &apos;s not still going on .
i have a friend in the courthouse .
the judge just finished jury instructions .
geez , talk about the luck .
well , i still can &apos;t comment on it .
uh , prady won &apos;t have any problem commenting on it--
he wants the black vote , he will play up the ,
you know , the blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
here , let me take the jacket .
excuse me , can you do this another time ?
she goes on in 20 minutes . when do you advise i take in the arms ?
if you want something to eat , i can make you a sandwich .
no , nothing to eat , it &apos;ll make her want to throw up onstage .
how about peanuts ?
no , now go away , crazy lady !
okay , okay , okay , just listen .
you show support to the police ,
but you also argue the best way to support the police ...
and let &apos;s lose the necklace .
it &apos;s less fussy .
why didn &apos;t you do this before ?
i need to see it on the body .
okay , we have 18 minutes to go , let &apos;s hold it together .
josh , step away for a second .
me . i &apos;m the only one doing my job .
okay , take a breath .
where &apos;s jon ?
who ?
elfman .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;ll be here . why ?
never mind .
take a breath .
okay , the bad news is you &apos;re six points down .
the good news is this is your chance to take it to him .
okay ?
prady won &apos;t be expecting it .
we &apos;ve lowered expectations .
so don &apos;t be afraid to interrupt him .
tell him , &quot; that &apos;s not true ! &quot;
she &apos;s eight points down .
she needs to shake you .
she &apos;ll interrupt you , try to get you to insist on the rules .
but don &apos;t rise to the bait .
right , just roll with the punches , you &apos;re the frontrunner .
give off the air of the frontrunner ,
she &apos;ll look desperate .
he &apos;s a stickler for rules .
he &apos;ll complain to the moderator ,
and that &apos;ll make him look small .
uh @-@ oh , you &apos;re getting a call from work , a client .
no , not right now .
what are you doing ? we &apos;re in countdown mode .
she has to focus .
they say it &apos;s important .
okay , just take a message , i &apos;ll call them back .
it &apos;s neil gross .
i have to take it .
he &apos;s our biggest client .
just give me a second .
alicia !
what &apos;s the problem , mr. gross ?
yeah , they &apos;re saying $ 30 million .
$ 30 million .
i thought i said no higher than $ 15 million .
uh , you did say $ 15 million .
who &apos;s saying $ 30 million ?
i don &apos;t know , some guy , your lawyer .
i don &apos;t even know who he is .
um , evan ?
oh , evan .
yeah , he &apos;s a ... he &apos;s a good lawyer .
yeah , well , you need to protect me-- i have a prenup .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m paying an arm and a leg .
just so you know , alicia , i &apos;m thinking about leaving .
oh , don &apos;t do that , mr. gross .
why ? you &apos;re running for office .
i don &apos;t even ... i don &apos;t even recognize these people .
come on , get your clothes on .
okay ,
let me look into it , and i &apos;ll get back to you .
good .
i &apos;m unhappy .
let &apos;s put this down here ,
we don &apos;t want to make it look like you &apos;re trying too hard .
there &apos;s been a last @-@ minute change-- we need to show you something .
all right , i just need a second .
alicia , it &apos;s eight minutes until you go on .
and they changed the clock .
you know , the , uh , the , um , you know , countdown thing .
it &apos;s digital now .
okay , i &apos;ll tell her ,
i &apos;ll tell her .
i need you to see it ...
can i have diane or cary , please ?
it &apos;s digital now .
ah , thank you , thank you so much .
i have to confess , i feel like i &apos;m 60 years older .
but i &apos;ve missed this ,
diane ?
i miss just @-@ just being ,
talking about something other than going to prison .
um , but , uh , yeah , it &apos;s been ...
it &apos;s alicia .
i &apos;m back now and i &apos;m ready to pitch in ,
so whatever you guys need , just ...
alicia , how are you ?
i think you &apos;re going on in about two minutes .
yes , um , look , i just got a call from neil gross .
he &apos;s very upset about his divorce settlement .
he called you ? why ?
he said that evan is offering $ 30 million
and he &apos;s threatening to leave the firm .
well , this is a surprise to me .
we agreed to go no higher than $ 15 million .
i know . there could be a chance that evan is freelancing .
look , i have to go on , could you take care of it ?
uh , yes . good luck , kick ass .
kalinda , do you have a minute ?
one second .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think you may need to suit up sooner than you expected .
my client is ruined , sir .
she &apos;s not &quot; ruined . &quot;
she has the house in brentwood ,
the apartment in san francisco .
emotionally ruined , scarred , distraught .
you slept with my best friend , i can &apos;t believe it .
you slept with my competitor .
that was a pre @-@ existing relationship .
which you then renewed .
where are we , evan ?
we &apos;re agreeing on an amount .
and we said $ 30 million isn &apos;t enough .
$ 30 million ? how did we get to $ 30 million ?
we didn &apos;t get to $ 30 million ,
your lawyer offered $ 30 million , and we said that wasn &apos;t enough .
why did you offer $ 30 million ?
i &apos;ll show you why .
photos .
you may want to avert your eyes , dear .
this is you , mr. gross , in bed with your ski instructor .
that &apos;s why your new head of family law ,
the one you promoted after i left ,
offered $ 30 million to settle .
because these photos will not look good on tmz .
that &apos;s intimidation , mr. lee .
a class three felony .
yes , if i indeed threatened you ,
but i did not . i just know
how salacious photos tend to find their way onto the web .
evan &apos;s always been our toughest negotiator .
i don &apos;t understand .
what changed ?
did david lee hire evan originally ?
you think he &apos;s intimidated by his old boss ?
i think he might be .
no .
could you give me a half hour ?
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
i think that david lee is offering him a job ,
but evan &apos;s too afraid to bite the hand that will feed him .
okay , so we put a pause in the negotiation ,
see if we should replace evan .
what ?
i &apos;ve missed this .
all the usual disasters .
do you want some water ? you should hydrate .
chris matthews . i am so glad to be doing this .
oh , hello , i &apos;m so glad you could .
with you two running for state &apos;s attorney ,
how could i not ?
i &apos;ll see you out there .
see you out there .
okay , i know , three minutes till you &apos;re on .
here are the key points again .
okay , wait , wait , we &apos;ve got a problem .
i just got a call from one of the reporters ,
and we got to think fast .
which one ?
patrick mancini .
with the , um , middeleton herald .
he &apos;s the one on the end right there .
he &apos;s a real jackass . what does he want ?
he &apos;s , uh ...
got photos of the governor with ramona lytton .
leaving her apartment .
from when ? when were they taken ?
uh , two days ago .
he plans on making that his first question .
eli , what is going on ?
i thought he broke it off .
yeah , stuck it in and broke it off .
okay , let &apos;s not jump to conclusions .
i will talk to him , but in the meantime ,
i wouldn &apos;t rise to the bait .
how do we not rise to the bait ? he &apos;s got the whole thing documented .
let my office deal with this-- defer to us .
we &apos;ve got three minutes .
uh , alicia , you &apos;re getting a call .
no , not now .
uh , from the governor .
don &apos;t take it .
he probably got a call from mancini , too .
there is nothing you can say right now
that &apos;ll make this any easier .
just try and relax .
i &apos;m away from my phone at the moment ,
so please leave a message .
are you ready , mr. governor ?
yes , i am , pastor .
and i want to thank you for inviting me .
no , it &apos;s best if we can all talk with one voice .
yes .
the fate of officers michael and trenton
are now in the hands of a jury .
um , can you just give me one second ?
eli , where are you ?
coming to you .
don &apos;t answer any questions about ramona .
they have photos of the two of you .
from when ?
two nights ago .
have they asked alicia about it ?
not yet , but they may in the debate .
just don &apos;t answer any calls , let me work on this for a while .
it &apos;s bill duncan .
oh , great , it &apos;s reached full saturation .
mr. governor , i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
bill , hey .
what are you hearing about the verdict ?
what ?
no .
are you serious ? we are on the verge of a race riot .
and you &apos;re asking me about the governor &apos;s sex life ? !
race riot ?
really ?
no , i will not dignify that .
just call me again when you get serious .
yep , black people .
just can &apos;t help themselves , can they ?
i &apos;m not saying you &apos;ll riot .
oh , thanks .
well , you &apos;re not like other ...
... people .
what other people ?
black people ?
no .
what , am i not black enough ?
no ... y @-@ yes ...
you &apos;re more suburban .
why am i even here ?
what ?
eli , you never want me out of the office .
tonight ?
you wanted me with you .
i thought it was just a perk of the job .
okay .
well , i &apos;m your black shield tonight , okay ?
it &apos;s roger hailman .
yeah , he &apos;s my friend at the courthouse .
roger , hey , what &apos;s up ?
ladies and gentlemen , please take your seats .
we go live in 90 seconds .
you can &apos;t defer to governor &apos;s office .
that &apos;s like throwing the &quot; you know &quot; to the sharks .
i agree , but what does she say ?
all marriages have their , uh , their blah @-@ blahs , their trials .
that &apos;s acknowledging the premise of the question .
he slept with prostitutes .
i think the premise has been acknowledged .
&quot; what does this have to do with my job as state &apos;s attorney ? &quot;
how is that not accepting the premise of the question ?
questioning the question .
okay , guys , guys .
i am gonna say it &apos;s none of their business .
it is their business , and that &apos;ll make you look defensive .
say peter and you have to trust each other .
no , she &apos;ll look like a doormat .
can you let me finish ?
what ?
dad just texted me . he can &apos;t get ahold of you .
the last one we want to hear from right now is the governor .
no , the jury is coming in .
what , wait , what ?
the cole willis jury is coming in right now .
they just went out , are you kidding me ?
they deliberated for ten minutes .
well , we need a response , they &apos;re gonna ask ... see , look .
okay , if they find the cops guilty ...
they &apos;re not gonna find the cops guilty .
not after ten minutes of blah @-@ ing .
if the verdict comes back not guilty ,
then we have to make a comment .
no , it &apos;s too early
we don &apos;t know where this is going yet .
i &apos;m not saying she has to come out pro @-@ cop or anti @-@ cop ...
guys , guys .
okay , thanks .
good evening , and welcome to the debate
for cook county state &apos;s attorney ,
coming to you from the ballroom of the bonaventure hotel .
remember , in terms of the affair ,
the charges are unsubstantiated .
and you want to handle it
within the sanctity of your marriage .
and don &apos;t get provocative with the jury verdict .
that could go either way .
don &apos;t be thrown by the countdown clock--- it &apos;s , uh , digital .
blinks green when you have ten seconds left .
green ? why does it blink green ?
why not red ?
i don &apos;t know .
to screw with us .
oh , and meet prady halfway across the stage to shake his hand .
your mic is live , so say ,
&quot; good to see you , frank . &quot;
you got it ?
what ?
you got it ?
&quot; good to see you , frank . &quot;
and now i &apos;d like to introduce the two candidates ,
alicia florrick and frank prady .
good luck , you &apos;ll be great .
good to see you again , alicia .
good to see you , too , frank .
there are limits on the applause later ,
but for now , why don &apos;t we all give them a big hand ?
&quot; take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ,
&quot; for i will not hear the melody of thy viols .
&quot; but let justice roll down as waters
and righteousness as a mighty stream . &quot;
now , that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
not for the sweet words of flattery ,
but for justice , peace .
you can &apos;t get ahold of him ?
what do you mean , you can &apos;t get ahold of him ?
the mayor is in new hampshire .
you &apos;re kidding .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
looks like rank selfishness on his part .
yes , except we &apos;re trying to stop a riot from happening here .
interrupt the debate ...
all right , get me his chief of staff .
i have her on hold right now .
so what ? he &apos;s taking a run for president ?
eli ! sorry to keep you waiting .
this must be about the verdict .
yes . the governor is worried
about the mayor being indisposed .
okay , well , tell him not to worry , eli .
the mayor and i have been on the phone for the last hour .
really ? how &apos;d he do that ?
i &apos;ve been watching him on a live feed at a fund @-@ raiser in concord .
are you and i gonna have trouble tonight , eli ?
not unless this explodes on us .
okay , it won &apos;t explode .
the mayor canceled all furloughs ,
we have 800 extra officers on the street ,
in riot gear , with tear gas .
而大陪审团决定不提起诉讼 引发抗议
they &apos;re going full ferguson on this , sir .
oh , come on , eli , this is hardly an equivalent situation .
put me on with her .
hold on .
hello , franny .
listen to me . can you hear me ?
uh , yes , mr. governor . how are you this evening ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m at the interdenominational conference downtown
and i need you to get your ass down here right now ,
or i &apos;m gonna drag the mayor through the mud .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not sure what mud you &apos;re talking about .
you know damn well what mud i &apos;m talking about .
now , i gave the mayor early warning on this verdict ,
and he &apos;s still sitting on his ass in new hampshire ,
thinking he can sit this out and blame me .
well , you can tell him
that i &apos;m the one in front of the cameras with the megaphone .
you have to understand ,
there were no flights , so it &apos;s ...
wow . all right , let &apos;s go .
questions will be asked of both candidates on a rotating basis ,
with the first candidate given 45 seconds to respond ,
the second candidate , 30 seconds of rebuttal .
if that rebuttal mentions the other candidate by name ,
that candidate will have 20 seconds to respond .
both candidates will also have ten seconds to ask the other
a direct question .
unless , of course , the candidate has exceeded his or her time ,
and then , that candidate will have the option
of adding to their time , but only by subtracting it
from their closing arguments .
there will also be a lightning round in which both candidates
will have ten seconds to respond .
mr. prady , you have 15 seconds .
i come in with a clean slate .
i have no bureaucratic grudges .
nothing to prove .
all i see
is a city that needs a new way ,
and i want to be that new way .
mrs. florrick .
i hear that a lot .
a new way , a new approach to crime on our streets .
but no matter what ,
whenever i vote for that person ,
we end up right where we started .
we end up with ...
um , uh , the murder rate continually climbing .
we end up ...
in short , inexperience is not a value . .
mrs. florrick , your time is up . it is something to be ..
mr. prady , in about ten minutes
we &apos;ll have a verdict
in the cole willis manslaughter case .
do you have a comment on that trial ?
well , chris , uh , i will in about ten minutes .
for now , all i can say is i think we have to
take a look at police training .
why is she frowning ?
you have her frowning .
well , this is all new to her .
give her a second .
no , you prepped her wrong .
you got ... i got to go .
yeah , eli , i just got off the phone with the mayor .
we &apos;re not gonna leave the police exposed .
no one said they &apos;ll be exposed .
but they go in with riot gear ,
they &apos;ll create a riot .
that &apos;s what happened in ferguson .
okay , but with all due respect to the governor ,
we &apos;re deferring to the police on this .
no , no , no . you &apos;re playing politics
because you want police support in four years .
okay , and you want
the african @-@ american support , sir .
no one &apos;s winning a nobel peace prize here .
no one wins if there &apos;s a riot .
pastor !
come on , let &apos;s not play
dueling pastors here .
pastor jeremiah ,
i believe you know the mayor &apos;s chief of staff .
yes , i do . good evening .
good evening .
she believes the police
should be ready with riot gear and tear gas .
uh , that would be a terrible mistake .
i mean , the people want to see justice done ,
but they will protest peaceably
unless they are provoked .
franny ?
the mayor goes in like storm troopers ,
he &apos;ll be blamed .
that attitude is contagious .
it diffuses a situation .
and it &apos;s all cyclical .
how &apos;s she doing ?
i can &apos;t tell .
there &apos;s some bad body language there .
take a look at police training .
and your time is up , mr. prady .
lightning round .
do you believe the police were at fault
in ferguson , mrs. florrick ?
well , i &apos;m not sure ...
actually , it &apos;s the lightning round .
you only have five seconds .
it &apos;s complicated .
mr. prady ?
it &apos;s a systemic problem .
good . next question . talk to us about
race relations in chicago , mrs. florrick .
you &apos;ve got 45 seconds .
hi . it &apos;s , uh , a work in progress .
you found out something about evan ?
he &apos;s working with david lee ?
no .
then why is he caving ?
his son was undergoing surgery to remove histiocytosis tumors
at the lurie children &apos;s hospital today .
did you know that ?
no .
the operation was successful .
he just found out an hour ago .
well , i &apos;m glad .
but ...
yes , it was just before
he made the $ 30 million settlement offer .
he &apos;s become nice .
uh @-@ oh . we should send him home .
no .
we could open ourselves to a malpractice suit
from neil gross .
then , we step in .
yes .
supply the backbone . kalinda , did you
do any background work on mrs. gross
before their marriage ?
yes .
and afterwards .
freelance work for david lee ?
yes .
he wanted to see if she was cheating on him .
is there anything interesting there ?
yes .
photos .
good . poetic justice .
using david lee &apos;s work against him .
mrs. florrick ?
you have ten seconds to respond .
uh , crime is crime .
black and white shouldn &apos;t matter .
it often does , but that shouldn &apos;t prevent
the state &apos;s attorney from ...
your time is up .
but why don &apos;t you finish that sentence ?
... doing my job .
good . now , let &apos;s turn to our journalists .
first up , patrick mancini
from the middeleton herald .
do you have a question ?
i do . thank you .
mrs. florrick , your husband has not
always been faithful to you in your marriage .
in 2009 he , in fact , resigned from the office
you &apos;re now seeking partly because he was caught
in a sexual scandal ...
i &apos;m gonna interrupt you right there , mr. mancini .
actually , i &apos;m not finished , ma &apos;am .
yes . but you already called my campaign manager
with your question , so i &apos;m going
to save you the trouble .
oh , my god .
what is she doing ?
you have photos
of my husband supposedly at the apartment of his legal counsel--
is that correct ?
i wish you &apos;d just let me answer my question ,
mrs. florrick ... i mean , ask my question ,
mrs. florrick ...
my daughter is in the audience tonight , sir ,
and i would like to do her the favor
of addressing your question , not answering it .
holy ...
ow , stop !
this is how i would answer your question ,
mr. mancini .
how dare you , sir ?
do you have a personal life ?
do you have a spouse ?
do you know what it would be like
to have your personal life spilled
across the stage like this ?
broadcasted
into the homes of your friends , your workmates ,
your daughter &apos;s friends at school ?
do you know what that would be like ?
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m only reporting ...
it would be one thing if my job
had anything to do with my husband &apos;s infidelity .
i &apos;m not even sure what job that would be .
but your question would at least then be pertinent .
but i &apos;m running for state &apos;s attorney .
i am running to be someone to put
a dent in crime in this town .
what does that have to do with my married life ?
that was terrific .
uh @-@ oh . she &apos;s brought her own pastor .
all right , i &apos;ll deal with that .
why don &apos;t you make sure the police don &apos;t overreact ?
because it &apos;s the only story ...
this is gonna be fine .
gonna be fine .
actually , mrs. florrick ...
i know that i am past my time .
but let me just finish up .
we are real people up here .
mr. prady and myself .
we &apos;re not cartoons .
when you hurt us , we actually do bleed .
i know that that is hard for you to remember ,
mr. mancini , but it is worth trying .
if not for me , then for my daughter .
i , um ... yes , thank you . mr. prady ?
do you have a response ?
i never finished my question .
sure , if you want to finish your question .
i &apos;m breaking a story tomorrow
about the governor sleeping with his legal counsel .
i didn &apos;t create the story .
i &apos;m just reporting on it .
why don &apos;t i turn to frank prady ?
uh , 15 seconds .
do you have a rebuttal ?
uh , i don &apos;t have a rebuttal , no .
but i , uh , i will say this .
i think mrs. florrick deserves an apology
from the press .
ah , my own handiwork .
what are you talking about ?
david had you followed when he was representing your spouse .
that &apos;s why your prenup is void .
isn &apos;t that right , evan ?
yes , it is .
david , $ 15 million is as high as we go .
no . i &apos;ll keep these .
we have the originals , david .
good . keep them .
these are good enough for tmz .
not that i &apos;ll give it to them .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re getting this , david--
your client broke her vows .
yes .
by sleeping with mr. gross &apos; biggest competitor .
that &apos;ll look good for you ,
won &apos;t it , mr. gross ?
your wife prefers sleuthway over chumhum ?
amazing .
just amazing .
half my life is about lawyers these days ,
and just when i think i have reached bottom ,
the ninth circle of hell ,
there is always a circle lower .
after he calms down ,
tell him we &apos;ll settle for $ 100 million .
you have three hours or we &apos;re out of here .
governor florrick .
pastor .
hello , father .
son .
mr. governor , pastor isaiah believes
the mayor &apos;s plan
is the best way to handle any possible violence .
really ?
is that what you believe ?
i just know about a deal between you
and my father .
what deal ?
an $ 80,000 religious study ?
and i think it will be evident to those upset by the verdict
that they &apos;re being misled .
why do you hate me so much , son ?
i don &apos;t hate you , father .
i just believe you &apos;re being misled by politics .
it &apos;s your mother , isn &apos;t it ? she put you up to this .
okay , the mayor &apos;s plan has been implemented , mr. governor .
he asks that you assist in his efforts
by not withholding the national guard reserves .
well , this isn &apos;t good .
the verdict is in .
oh , crap .
i &apos;m calling the mayor . get out the national guard .
franny , if the mayor goes in with this warrior stance ,
there &apos;s going to be violence .
mr. prady ?
the point is , drug arrests have been on the rise
for years now and the sentencing guidelines are crazily wrong .
i &apos;m sorry . time &apos;s up , mr. prady .
mrs. florrick , you have ten seconds for a rebuttal .
yes , well , talking about guidelines ,
if there were guidelines that we ...
i &apos;m sorry again . one second .
excuse me .
our live feed has been interrupted .
uh , what the hell ?
damn it . she was just getting into a rhythm .
we &apos;re being asked to take a pause here .
the cole willis verdict is in .
and we &apos;re switching over to live coverage .
uh , the hope is that in one or two hours ,
they &apos;ll switch back to the debate .
stay tuned .
great job . you &apos;re kicking ass .
way to neutralize the sex stuff .
do you want some water ?
no , where &apos;s the food ?
i &apos;m starving .
in the hotel kitchen .
you want me to make you a plate ?
you &apos;re doing great , mom .
the verdict is in , and the two police officers
who killed suspected gang member cole willis
during a routine arrest were found innocent of all charges .
suspected gang member .
really ? the suburban father of two ?
okay , let &apos;s not get upset .
why ? you afraid i &apos;m gonna riot ?
nora .
this is your giuliani moment , sir .
careers are built on moments like ...
eli .
i &apos;m not saying you take advantage of it ,
but no one will talk about ramona
if you handle this properly .
eli , you need to stop .
oh , good , i &apos;m starved .
did they tell you not to eat , too ?
yes .
so , how do you think it &apos;s going ?
i don &apos;t know .
every time i get started , they say , &quot; time &apos;s up . &quot;
you had a good answer to that one reporter .
you were good with the racial question .
it &apos;s all artificial , isn &apos;t it ?
we agree on more than we don &apos;t .
we should debate now .
see if we disagree on anything .
our handlers won &apos;t be happy .
okay , you start .
it helps no one to throw the baby out
with the bath water .
the system need to be tweaked , not overhauled .
you really believe that ?
i do .
we &apos;re on the verge of another ferguson ...
no , no , no , that was just about jury selection .
the prosecution screwed up on voir dire .
that &apos;s why those two cops were found not guilty .
no , they were found not guilty because the system
is inherently racist . ask anyone .
so what do you do then ? if the system is racist ,
what is the state &apos;s attorney supposed ... ? you start with hiring .
the racial diversity in the office is a joke .
how many white prosecutors ...
no , but the exact opposite needs to be done .
it needs to be a pure meritocracy .
no cronyism .
to consider race ?
that &apos;s not cronyism .
yes , it is .
we need good prosecutors .
there are a dozen defense attorneys i know
making $ 400,000 a year
that would jump at the chance to put criminals away .
they &apos;re sick of what they &apos;re doing now and ...
w @-@ why don &apos;t they ?
what ?
you said they &apos;d jump
at the chance to be a prosecutor .
well , what &apos;s stopping them ?
well , what &apos;s stopping them
is that the office is poorly run .
they know they &apos;re gonna spend half their time
dealing with a stupid bureaucracy .
no , no , they don &apos;t jump
because it &apos;s easier to talk
about doing good than it is to actually do good .
and you call me cynical ?
chicago is on the verge of another ferguson ,
because the system is all white .
because african @-@ americans don &apos;t see someone
who shares their experience .
you know what &apos;s really stupid ?
you &apos;re two white people arguing
about why black people are rioting .
that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid .
and you &apos;re saying there needs to be more black people in office ,
and that &apos;s why we need two more white people running .
okay .
so what do you do ?
stop prosecuting so many drug crimes .
that &apos;s exactly my plan for office .
exactly !
that &apos;s why you should vote for me .
they put a guy in prison
for killing a dog just last week .
then these two cops kill a black man ,
and what happens ?
they go free ?
we should go there .
now .
what ?
pastor isaiah , would you like to come with me ?
where you going ?
there . ... to express their outrage
over the innocent verdict ...
are you serious ?
yes .
yes , let &apos;s go .
... where hundreds of people protesting
法院前 市中心
the cole willis verdict have begun gathering
outside the city courthouse .
i &apos;m gonna have trouble getting home tonight .
you might as well start home now .
you want these photos on tmz ?
we do .
i don &apos;t bluff , diane . you know i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t , either .
what &apos;s this ?
deena &apos;s employment contract as in @-@ house counsel
at chumhum .
evan , what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s a standard non @-@ compete clause
in the contracts .
oh , come on .
deena was sleeping with the ceo of chumhum &apos;s
greatest competitor during the time of that contract .
if you ask me , that violates her non @-@ compete .
that opens her up to a suit .
god , you guys are terrible .
evan , do you agree
with these kind of tactics ?
i &apos;m sorry , david .
yes , we &apos;re all sorry .
$ 15 million .
you have an hour to accept or it goes away .
my law partner , cary agos ,
was prosecuted on trumped @-@ up drug charges ,
so i understand this issue .
yeah , and he had all the advantages
of a white entitled businessman .
he &apos;s a lawyer , he knew lawyers ,
and he knew how to work the system ,
but you take any african @-@ american up
on drug charges ...
alicia . here you are .
why don &apos;t we head back to the greenroom ?
no , i &apos;ll meet you there .
no , i think we should go together .
hey , let them talk .
she said she &apos;d see you later . so what ?
you would just stop prosecuting all drug crime ?
no , nonviolent drug crimes .
i would de @-@ emphasize them .
you can just do that ?
i can ,
but i &apos;m not sure alicia can .
why is that ?
politics .
i believe she &apos;d want
to de @-@ emphasize drug crimes ,
but her critics would suggest
she was doing this as a favor to her old client ,
lemond bishop ,
a top drug dealer .
and they would be wrong .
which wouldn &apos;t matter .
the politics would work against her
relaxing drug prosecutions .
but i don &apos;t have any history here .
i am free and clear to act .
okay , folks , i think we &apos;re done here .
why would you want to stop prosecuting drug crimes ?
i can barely walk home at night
with all the dealers on my street .
&apos;cause it &apos;s mostly putting blacks in prison .
yeah , well , maybe they should be in prison .
excuse me , why is this all about black people ?
most of the trouble i have in my neighborhood
is because of the blacks .
okay , wait , wait , what ?
i &apos;m just telling you what happens in my neighborhood .
no , you &apos;re spouting racist bull .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m doing .
actually , you know what , man ?
there &apos;s no taping in here .
uh , it &apos;s a proprietary issue with the hotel .
how have you been , pastor ?
i &apos;m well .
i see that you have been , too .
i have .
it &apos;s been a while .
it has .
how are you and alicia ?
fine .
no .
no , you haven &apos;t been .
well , life &apos;s ...
complicated .
it is .
still believe ?
do i believe in god ?
at times .
you still pray ?
no .
do you want me to pray for you ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d have you pray for .
that you be a good man .
do you want to be good ?
i think it &apos;s a little late for that .
i want to be ...
effective .
does one discount the other ?
it can .
tonight , for example ...
i need to be effective .
pray for that .
okay , then what do you do ?
you talk about equality ,
you talk about overcoming racism .
because that &apos;s the point .
no , that &apos;s the poetry .
that makes people feel good when you say it ,
but that is not the s.a. &apos; s job ,
and it wouldn &apos;t make a bit of a difference .
that &apos;s cynicism talking .
no , that &apos;s a defense attorney talking ,
saying that i have seen firsthand what prosecutors do wrong .
and i know how to correct it .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ll be better at it than you .
you &apos;re not ...
because i &apos;m not trying
to remake the world .
i don &apos;t think i can change people .
i think i can change the office .
you know what , go ahead and shoot whatever you want .
i can put defense attorneys in office
who are hungry to put criminals away .
i can go after the top crooks because i know who they are .
because you represented them .
yes !
and i know how they work .
i &apos;m not going in , hoping for pie in the sky .
we &apos;ve had enough pretty words .
we &apos;ve had enough of novices who talk a good game
but then throw their hands up when they realize
they can &apos;t stop racism .
they can &apos;t make everyone good .
that &apos;s why people should vote for me and not you .
frank !
let &apos;s go .
now . you &apos;re eight points up .
don &apos;t squander it .
oh . we can get a photo .
ready ? one , two , three .
how many people died of ebola in america ? one .
a black man who did everything he was supposed to do .
he went to the hospital . what did they do ?
they sent him home with some aspirin .
everybody white got cured .
just the black guy they sent home with some pills .
let &apos;s go .
george , how are you ?
so you lucked out , eli .
what are you talking about ?
the governor is sleeping with his lawyer ,
and what &apos;s the headline ? a race riot ?
how dare you , george ?
the governor is facing one of the biggest challenges of his life .
am i quoting you now ?
no , just background .
and you &apos;re obsessing about some stupid , unsubstantiated sideshow ?
okay , okay , so what do you want me to quote ?
well , the governor is pulling up right now . i want you to ...
to look over there
and i will bring the governor to you .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
do you want access , george ?
then go over there .
what are you doing here ?
are you insane ?
the governor asked for me .
have you seen the news ?
no one &apos;s reporting it .
because i &apos;ve been killing myself
trying to keep it out of the news . if they see you here ...
it &apos;s my job , eli .
the governor wants to discuss the legal implications of
closing down the nearest cell tower .
no , no , there are so many things wrong with that sentence .
just go home .
hey , ramona .
you got a minute ?
peter , no , you can &apos;t be seen with her .
that &apos;ll bring ramona back into the news .
just need ten minutes , that &apos;s all .
can you give me ten minutes , pastor ?
sure , peter , take the time you need .
ramona , i have a question for you .
dear god .
are you all right , eli ?
no .
i &apos;m not .
i just realize that i work very hard ,
and i am not appreciated .
you want to talk about it ?
okay , we &apos;re back in about ten minutes .
what &apos;s going on out there ?
any violence ?
some sporadic . nothing cohesive yet .
yeah , nothing visual .
the news is getting bored .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re cutting back to the debate .
you &apos;ll get more samplers than usual ,
so keep up the pressure .
yeah , and although it was unorthodox ,
your extracurricular debate with prady
has got his people really scared .
yeah , so just keep up the pressure .
yeah , i &apos;m thinking of voting for you now .
that &apos;s how good you were .
great .
i need to talk to jon alone for a minute .
you weren &apos;t gonna vote for her before ?
no , i &apos;m not a big voter .
i &apos;m in my 20s .
alicia , i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s such a good idea ...
wait . listen .
it didn &apos;t mean anything .
what ?
in the parking garage ?
i was in a mood .
it didn &apos;t mean anything .
jon , you can look at me .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine , really .
it just surprised me is all .
it &apos;s a version of transference .
you know , sometimes candidates or their wives ,
they , uh , they develop feelings of affection for their handlers .
it &apos;s not ...
okay , let &apos;s not do that .
okay .
you don &apos;t need to instruct me about my feelings .
sorry .
that &apos;s how i deal with things .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s whatever .
you still can &apos;t look at me , can you ?
look at me .
i don &apos;t have feelings for you .
we &apos;re good .
it just ... happened .
i ...
what ?
we &apos;ve got a problem .
what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re calling the debate off tonight .
really ? why ?
frank prady . he wants to delay .
did he say why ?
tonight is not a night for political posturing
and 30 @-@ second canned responses to questions
about racial stratification .
tonight is a night for action .
by action , you mean running away ?
that is why i am asking my opponent to join me
in taking to the streets .
now is the time to listen .
so , is it the time to listen or the time for action ?
jackass , get your story straight .
this is perfect ; he just made a mistake .
okay , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna get out there ...
get out where ?
at your podium , and you &apos;re gonna tell the reporters
you &apos;re ready to debate .
we get a photo with you standing at your podium facing no one .
&quot; i paid for this mic . &quot;
here &apos;s the thing , alicia .
this is the turning point of the campaign .
they just made a mistake .
yeah , that &apos;s something americans understand . cowardice .
the dog ate my ... uh , blah @-@ blah .
you ready ? can you do it ?
let &apos;s go .
no , i &apos;m coming there now .
it &apos;s an irritant .
we can handle it .
okay .
what happened , neil ?
deena used her knowledge with the chumhum board .
knowledge of what ?
the fappening .
what ? what is that ?
it &apos;s naked photos of celebrities hacked online .
yes , my ex @-@ wife called the board
and accuses me of not doing enough to stop the hacking .
leaves us open to a suit .
in what way &quot; open &quot; ?
yeah , well , here &apos;s the thing .
you &apos;re fired .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
you &apos;re fired .
you needed to close this down immediately .
you didn &apos;t .
now i have to settle for $ 75 million .
you cost me $ 60 million .
i &apos;m done .
mr. gross , no other firm could &apos;ve done anything else .
you know what , cary , save it .
your attorney screwed up .
david lee took advantage of you .
that is why i &apos;m stuck where i am .
i don &apos;t like losing $ 60 million .
i especially don &apos;t like losing it
to a wife who cheated on me .
you need to get your act together .
that was unfortunate .
it was .
you know what we need to do .
i think i do .
well , hello .
you want to offer me more than $ 100 million ?
no .
we know you &apos;re not happy with canning .
he &apos;s sick , and you &apos;ve been carrying all the weight .
well , well .
kalinda &apos;s really been working overtime for you .
we want you back , david .
i guess you just can &apos;t quit me , can you ?
what do you want , david ?
we get no justice , you get no peace .
we get no justice , you get no peace .
we get no justice , you get no peace .
eli , we need to talk now .
yeah , i know .
... you get no peace .
we get no justice ,
you get no peace . black lives matter !
black lives matter !
black lives matter !
black lives matter ! black lives matter !
black lives matter !
black lives matter !
black lives matter !
black lives matter !
ramona , i need you to not talk to anyone .
i know how it works , eli .
what happened ?
he said good @-@ bye .
so that &apos;s it .
good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , ramona .
black lives matter !
did you have any luck , pastor ?
she &apos;s here .
black lives matter ! black lives matter !
it &apos;s good to meet you , deidre .
i &apos;m sorry about the death of your husband .
thank you .
i think we all want the same thing .
we get no justice , you get no peace !
the mayor &apos;s on his way from the airport .
good . good for him .
eli , he &apos;s asking that you hold
the press conference for 20 minutes .
franny , this is not a press conference .
this is an urgent need to stop a riot .
no , it &apos;s not . no one &apos;s rioting .
you &apos;re trying to take advantage ...
seriously .
the governor is stepping in for an absentee mayor
in the city &apos;s time of need .
you don &apos;t want to make an enemy .
no , you don &apos;t .
cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole ! cole !
cole ! cole ! cole !
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry that we have to meet under such circumstances ,
but i wanted you to hear
from the person who should be the angriest at tonight &apos;s events .
deidre .
cole was a good man .
if he were here right now ,
he &apos;d be saying what i &apos;m saying to you now .
this is not the time to break things .
this is the time to fix them .
tonight ,
we are not black or white ,
rich or poor ...
that is governor florrick
speaking from the cook county courthouse steps
on an extraordinary night
of protests and outrage .
it &apos;s odd as we &apos;re looking at these images of protesting downtown .
you go about your life , not even thinking
about the injustices suffered by others .
and that &apos;s part of the problem .
but tonight we all ...
hello ?
i like what you &apos;ve done with it .
what &apos;s up , david ?
i like this office .
it gets the morning light .
i &apos;m glad .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve come home , alicia .
we &apos;re partners again .
isn &apos;t that great ?
did what we had to do ,
and we &apos;re gonna keep doing it ...
what happened ?
oh , alicia .
how did the debate go ?
we &apos;re not sure ; we think good .
what &apos;s going on ?
david lee was just in my office ,
saying he &apos;s coming back .
yes , we &apos;re replacing evan .
as of when ?
an hour ago .
are you serious ?
you ...
when did you decide this ?
an hour ago .
but you can &apos;t just ...
don &apos;t you think it was important to talk to me ?
well , we tried calling you , but we had to decide right away .
i &apos;m a name partner .
this is a decision for all of us .
no , it isn &apos;t ,
alicia , not anymore .
your running for state &apos;s attorney--
that was a decision for all of us .
i told you two ...
that it was about castro .
it was about cary being prosecuted by him .
well , castro &apos;s not in the race anymore ,
so why are you still in ?
i have 90 volunteers working for me ,
five paid consultants ,
small donations from 38,000 people ,
all trying to help me win .
and you &apos;re asking why am i still in ?
look , let &apos;s just take ...
no ! if i were a man ...
oh , come on . you never would &apos;ve ...
this is about two people trying to run a law firm .
this has nothing to do with sexism .
like hell it doesn &apos;t .
i want to win .
i want to beat my opponent .
you wouldn &apos;t even blink if a man had said that .
why am i still in ?
because i think i would make a better state &apos;s attorney .
there .
you have a problem with that ?
okay , we need to ready
a statement for tomorrow &apos;s sun @-@ times ,
and i need you to get on the phone
with michael sneed in five minutes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . everything &apos;s great .
i &apos;m gonna win .
yes , you are .
uh , but we &apos;ve got to keep the momentum going .
prady took a hit tonight , but we &apos;ve got to close the deal .
so , uh , michael sneed is a great lady .
i &apos;ve known her for a long time .
she &apos;s not gonna come at you with anything crazy .
she &apos;s gonna talk about family ,
uh , why you got into law in the first place ...
