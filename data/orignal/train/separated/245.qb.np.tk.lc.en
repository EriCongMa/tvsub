gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
bart. he &apos;s alive .
what about lily ?
have you thought about how you wanna break the news to her ?
where exactly are you gonna find some other upper east side woman
to take care of you the way i have ?
you just made my decision for us to spend some time apart
that much easier .
i &apos;m with chuck . he needs me .
he &apos;s going through an extremely difficult time right now .
my computer is gone .
gossip girl . she took it .
how do you know that ?
either way , it &apos;s over . the real gossip girl is back .
do you really wanna spend
the entire summer with me in rome ?
there is nothing i want more .
i &apos;ve got a page from blair waldorf &apos;s diary
where she tells all about who &apos;s really in her heart .
good morning , upper east siders .
how do you look today ?
you know image is everything .
oh , it &apos;s so great to hear from you , david .
i would love to work together on another movie .
yeah , i &apos;ll look out for my premiere invitation .
see you then . bye .
but under those perfect clothes and perfect smiles ,
everyone has their not @-@ so @-@ perfect secrets .
i take it you &apos;ve decided to ask lola to move in for the summer .
she sleeps here every night .
i wanna see her every day .
i figure , why not ?
this place could use a woman &apos;s touch .
couldn &apos;t we all .
lucky for me , nothing can stay hidden forever .
have you heard from lily ?
no . nothing .
whether the truth &apos;s in a diary
or the daily news ...
once it &apos;s out , it will change everything .
let the chips fall where they may--
along with the husbands and boyfriends .
it &apos;s bad enough you read my diary ,
but to publically expose my naked thoughts
is unconscionable !
b , i was never gonna publish them .
i just wanted to know that i could .
i was upset about you and dan .
and i &apos;m so sorry . i never thought gossip girl would
steal my computer with everything on it .
well , i took dan &apos;s phone just so he wouldn &apos;t see anything .
but i &apos;m just postponing the inevitable
if she keeps releasing pages .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about dan . he &apos;s a writer .
he knows that diaries are all about exploring your thoughts .
like all terrible things you said about me--
that &apos;s not how you really feel .
it is now . oh !
&quot; another day of wedding planning where my mother needs
to make me small so she can be the star . &quot;
there goes that relationship !
no big deal ! who needs a mother ? !
you better find a way to stop this
before i lose everyone i ever cared about .
i will , right away .
dorota !
we need to find every damning thing i ever wrote
so we can be proactive about damage control .
every damning thing since grade school
is a lot of damning .
do you wanna steam laundry in siberia ?
mobilize the troops !
hey .
hey .
i know you wanna talk to me about something ,
but can i go first ?
yeah , sure . what &apos;s going on ?
i got a job as a swing in the touring company of &quot; wicked . &quot;
a swing ? what &apos;s that ? like a part or a prop ?
it &apos;s like an understudy
but for a lot of characters .
it &apos;s not exactly my dream , but with my mom in jail ,
it solves my summer housing problem .
well , i know housing &apos;s an issue ,
but you don &apos;t have to leave new york .
i don &apos;t want to leave you either .
but even if i could afford to stay here ,
i &apos;d never find an acting job that paid enough .
it &apos;s best option . i have to get to my fitting , okay ?
all right , well , i , um--
oh ! you wanted to talk .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll come over as soon as i &apos;m done , okay ?
i appreciate everything
f.h.p did for stella .
i &apos;m just not sure that it &apos;s the right path for me .
all right , talk soon .
blair , darling , why is dorota carrying your life history ?
suffice it to say that i apologize in advance
if any of your meetings today are negatively affected
by the publication of my intimate musings .
thank you .
&quot; my mother considers herself an arbiter of parisian style ,
but the only french she is intimate with are fries . &quot;
well ...
the reflections of an overprivileged
and unattended 13 @-@ year @-@ old
have no bearing on the business i &apos;m in town for ,
which i have to discuss with you .
i would love to , just as soon as i get my own business in order .
oh .
pages with foot and mouth
already marked from &quot; k &quot; to 6 .
what are you waiting for ?
every minute is another bridge burned .
why should we help you when you called us &quot; back of house &quot; ?
that was you .
um , she says my hair is as thick as jessica simpson &apos;s .
that says &quot; head . &quot;
you should be grateful that your names are mentioned at all .
that guy spent one week with marilyn ,
and he is still living off the royalties .
your grandchildren will brag
that their ancestors were belittled by blair waldorf .
fine . what do we have to do ?
hey .
if you &apos;re calling to yell at me about blair &apos;s diary ,
i @-@ i know . i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i know i deserve it .
but i am doing everything i can
to get gossip girl to stop posting any more of it .
wait a second . gossip girl has blair &apos;s diary ?
that &apos;s not why you &apos;re calling ?
no , no . uh , my dad was trying to reach lily ,
and i was wondering if you &apos;d spoken to her since ...
bart &apos;s resurrection .
no , i left her a couple messages last night ,
but i haven &apos;t heard from her .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go deal with this blair thing .
yeah , yeah , yeah , about that--
just be the bigger person and don &apos;t read any of them .
stay off &quot; gossip girl , &quot; okay ?
serena hasn &apos;t heard from lily ?
no , she hasn &apos;t .
is that lily getting back to you ?
no , it &apos;s my lawyer . i asked him to find out
what bart &apos;s reappearance means to my marriage .
and ?
&quot; lily and bart never got a divorce ,
so technically they &apos;re still married . &quot;
wait , wait , wait . what ?
one of lily &apos;s marriages has to be annulled .
i wanna make sure it &apos;s not mine . i gotta go .
deceiving you was the only way
to keep you and chuck safe .
if i had known ,
maybe we could &apos;ve done things differently .
you mean you would &apos;ve come with me .
please .
you were getting ready to leave me for rufus .
i &apos;m sorry for that .
i should &apos;ve had more respect for our marriage .
what about charles ?
i mean , uh , his thinking you were dead was hell for him .
he got through it , though ,
with your help .
he told me about the adoption , lily .
i owe you everything for that .
charles is family .
and even with you back , he &apos;s mine , too .
and now here we are ,
technically still married ,
with a son that we legally share .
i can &apos;t deny the fact there &apos;s a part of me that would ...
like to move back in here ,
repair the damage to our relationship--
a great deal of which i am responsible for .
you know , bart , i have some wonderful memories ...
i know . i know .
you &apos;ve moved on .
you are ... happily married to rufus .
i &apos;m sorry . it was foolish of me to think
that you &apos;d ever choose me over him .
status report .
penelope--social suicide watch .
the met &apos;s not gonna be happy .
make a donation .
also include the ballet , opera .
skip m.o.m.a.
tim burton isn &apos;t art .
i stand by that statement .
jessica , you are on restaurants .
i need to be able to eat in this town again .
start by apologizing at per se
and work your way down to boulud sud .
kati , regarding fashion , tell diane that when i said
her wraps looked like they were for falafels ,
that i meant it as a compliment .
what could be more interesting than saving my future ?
your past .
this is all serena &apos;s fault !
she said she would fix it . it just made it worse .
go .
not you . i have a new task for you .
i &apos;m not comfortable kissing dan .
i &apos;ll manage matters of my heart .
you find every secret serena has .
i need the best one , to destroy her .
i just hope chuck and dan don &apos;t see this .
for my father &apos;s press conference this afternoon ,
make sure you only have hard sources--
the &quot; times , &quot; &quot; the journal . &quot; no perez .
what is it ?
&quot; this new romance with dan is fun ,
but is cultural stimulation enough ?
what if i never love anyone more than i chuck ? &quot;
looks like someone forgot a &quot; d &quot; at the end of that word .
guess we just answered who is in blair &apos;s heart .
question is , is there room for two ?
dan ? hello , it &apos;s me !
do you want to come with me
to the shepherds &apos; divorce party tonight ?
i should &apos;ve known that marriage was doomed
when serena banged my boyfriend at the reception .
you saw &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
you wanna reimburse me for my new phone ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s you who took the old one .
i swear , it was just a fleeting thought that
i jotted down the day before our hotel room incident .
and drunk elevator sex changed all that .
i would have edited it out of my biography
had it not already been posted for posterity .
what you wrote wasn &apos;t about sex .
it was about your feelings .
my feelings about our impending sex ,
which no longer apply .
blair , i told you i loved you ,
and you pretended like you didn &apos;t even hear me .
well , dan , let &apos;s just put all that behind us .
y @-@ you &apos;re-- you &apos;re doing it again .
do you even want to be in this relationship ?
of course .
is the reason you can &apos;t say you love me because ...
you &apos;re still in love with chuck ?
no .
then i need to know how do you feel about me ,
by tonight .
dan .
we &apos;re supposed to be spending the summer in italy together ,
and i don &apos;t want you coming unless i know where we stand .
sorry that took so long . i &apos;m here to talk now .
there &apos;s actually someone you need to talk to first .
dad !
your roommate said i would find you here .
you look great .
oh . well , is everything okay ?
did something happen with mom &apos;s case ?
no , i &apos;m afraid her future is still pretty uncertain .
but i don &apos;t want yours to be ,
so i &apos;ve arranged for carol &apos;s half of cece &apos;s estate
to be transferred to you .
this is a lot of money .
you know what it means , right ?
i can pay for school .
and not be an oompa loompa understudy .
you can stay in new york ...
and live with me .
did you just ask me to move in with you ?
i believe he did .
you can say no if you want , but you can &apos;t make the excuse
that you don &apos;t fit into my world anymore .
it &apos;s your world now , too .
well , this is my mom &apos;s money .
i can &apos;t make any decisions until i talk to her .
rufus , you &apos;re looking well .
i see the transition from brooklyn to the big @-@ time
has done you wonders .
i &apos;m , uh , not here for small talk .
i just need you to sign these annulment papers .
lily has chosen to end our marriage
in order to save yours ?
she made her choice three years ago
when she decided to leave you for me .
nothing &apos;s changed since then .
maybe i have .
all that time in hiding
made me realize what &apos;s really important .
what does-- what does that mean exactly ?
that if lily &apos;s happiness depends on my signature on these ,
you will have them by the end of the day .
thank you .
i just got off the phone with david o. russell &apos;s assistant .
my invitation to the premiere was rescinded ...
i &apos;ve always found him an intelligent filmmaker .
because gossip girl posted a diary page
about how i never read &quot; the beautiful and damned , &quot;
so i just pretended to to get the job .
well , maybe you should &apos;ve considered that
before you leaked my diary .
it wasn &apos;t in your diary .
not the ones you found , but it was
on the page i just wrote
and e @-@ mailed to gossip girl
when i saw your invitation .
blair , you knew how important that job was to me ,
and--and i was on the verge of getting another one .
summer job on a film set versus exposing all my secrets .
no , i &apos;m not sorry .
&quot; i &apos;ll never love chuck again
after what he did tonight .
he &apos;s a monster . he deserves to be alone forever . &quot;
i was waiting for that one .
you happy now , now that i &apos;m as alone as you are ?
well , i &apos;m only alone because of you .
you--you had your prince and you had chuck .
you didn &apos;t need to take dan , too .
i didn &apos;t &quot; take &quot; dan . that &apos;s not how relationships work .
you would know that
if you &apos;d grown up at all since high school .
oh , come on , blair . you &apos;re the one who can &apos;t move on .
you--you &apos;re still in love with chuck
and you still won &apos;t admit it .
get out .
i mean it . i want you gone for good .
pack your things .
you can &apos;t hold me responsible for everything bad in your life .
i can because you are .
the best time i ever had
was when you were gone six years ago .
leave your key with dorota .
well , it &apos;s about time william gave you my money .
i was starting to worry
he &apos;d made some secret alliance with lily .
i guess it just took a while to arrange everything .
but now we can hire you a great defense lawyer .
i already have one .
abrams &amp; weil took my case
pro bono last week .
apparently , one of the partners read about me
in the new york social diary .
just out of the blue like that ?
wow . well , that &apos;s great , mom .
then why aren &apos;t you smiling ?
this money is a good thing .
go tell nate you &apos;ll move in with him .
don &apos;t turn your back on the life that ...
i almost screwed up for you .
i am proud of you , son .
lily told me you &apos;d stepped up ,
but i had no idea how much you accomplished .
thank you .
how was seeing lily after all this time ?
i never dealt with such a formidable woman .
made me regret not treating her better .
they do require dedication .
i assume you &apos;re talking about blair waldorf .
but you two aren &apos;t back together ?
i made a lot of mistakes after you left .
i lost my temper .
i ... lost myself .
when i finally realized what i &apos;d done
and i had the ring to propose , i ...
i was too late .
and then she married a prince .
now she &apos;s with dan humphrey .
or at least i think she is .
i don &apos;t really know how she feels about either of us .
so ... what are you waiting for ?
chances like this don &apos;t come around by often .
and no one does a grand , romantic gesture
better than a bass .
of course i didn &apos;t have anything to do
with your mother &apos;s new lawyer .
carol still won &apos;t speak to me .
but if you need any help
paying their fees , i &apos;ll contribute .
everyone deserves a defense .
well , the firm is working for free .
and if i needed money , i have my mon &apos;s half of cece &apos;s estate .
that &apos;s right . william--uh , well , your father mentioned that .
excuse me , miss lily .
i have delivery from your attorney .
thank you , vanya .
bye .
is everything okay ?
i &apos;m not sure .
would you mind letting yourself out ?
律师事务所
make sure they know
the q &amp; a will be limited to ten minutes
only on specified subjects .
that &apos;s all for now .
what are you doing here ?
i ... came to check on you .
gossip girl &apos;s been putting a bunch of stuff up ,
and i wanted to make sure that you weren &apos;t hurt .
why would i be hurt
about something that was in your diary a year ago ?
we &apos;ve been through so much since then ,
talked about everything , made amends .
or is there some other reason you &apos;re here ?
maybe to tell me you and dan broke up ?
no .
we haven &apos;t .
i can &apos;t play this game anymore , blair .
i spent the whole year waiting for you .
i need to move forward with my life now .
of course .
you &apos;re right .
unless there &apos;s something else you need to say .
如果你还在乎我
i have to go .
blair &apos;s dirty work can wait .
she fired me .
i &apos;m on my way to meet everyone at michael jordan &apos;s steakhouse
for the shepherds &apos; divorce party .
oh , well , there &apos;s been a change of plans .
you &apos;re not going to that , and neither is blair ,
and you and your friends are going to see to it .
that &apos;s the problem with hired help .
they &apos;ll work for anyone .
计划已定 我会让布莱尔拖在家里
you look just as beautiful in black as you did white .
hey . you look dapper .
oh , thank you . you look beautiful .
blair texted me that she would be here ,
so i &apos;m--i &apos;m feeling a little bit better .
then you should probably stay off &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
why ?
did i miss another diary post ?
she was just spotted at the empire .
come on , she &apos;s probably just telling chuck
that--that it &apos;s over between them for good ,
and i bet she &apos;s on her way here now .
come on , let &apos;s go get you an &quot; ale @-@ imony &quot; while we wait .
i appreciate you doing all this .
it &apos;s important that the world know you &apos;re back .
to new partnerships .
speaking of which ...
you didn &apos;t need to buy me a gift .
actually , you bought it .
i was at harry winston ,
picking up an apology trinket for lily .
helene told me it was in the vault .
i thought you might want it back .
why ?
well , isn &apos;t blair still the most important thing in your life ?
where &apos;s that last grand gesture we spoke of earlier ?
maybe i &apos;ll just hold on to it .
lily . what a present surprise .
charles , do you mind if i speak to your father alone ?
i &apos;ll tell everyone we need a few more minutes .
i can &apos;t believe how much more grown up you are at your age
than i was .
i suppose it &apos;s the divorce ,
and all the other mistakes you &apos;ve already made .
well , it won &apos;t get easier any time soon .
i &apos;m headed for a reckoning-- dan vs. chuck .
ooh . you always did love jane austen .
as literature ,
not my life !
dan is my best friend .
when we &apos;re together , it &apos;s great .
i feel strong and safe--
except in his neighborhood .
and with chuck ?
i &apos;m vulnerable .
he &apos;s devastated me ,
but ...
he &apos;s also made me happier than i &apos;ve ever been .
i @-@ i just don &apos;t know which kind of love is better .
you probably think i &apos;m pathetic for even caring .
if i was truly powerful ,
i &apos;d be content without any man at all .
well , even moguls have hearts , my dear .
trust me , blair .
there isn &apos;t a woman out there more powerful than you are .
you really think so ?
yes , i do . that &apos;s why i want you to take over my company .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to talk to you about .
i have decided to retire ,
and i know you &apos;ve always said
you didn &apos;t want any part of what i do .
well , have you seen my closet ?
mm @-@ hmm .
fashion is art and culture and history
and everything i love combined .
but i &apos;m not a designer .
so your first order of business
will be to find the right one to take over .
so what do you say ? will you do it ?
will a real waldorf woman carry on the name ?
yes . of course yes !
hugs ? what did i miss ?
knock ! were you raised in a barn ?
what are you doing here ? i dismissed you hours ago .
then your diary said
i was pathetic for showing up everything alone .
so i thought we could go to the shepherds &apos; party together .
but is that what you &apos;re wearing ?
serena just left here in exactly the same color scheme .
give me a minute .
mmm . two more prenup shots , please .
you know , maybe i should just text blair .
no . no , don &apos;t do that . that will completely ruin the romance
of her showing up to be with you .
what ?
what ? what happened ?
i think--i think chuck is proposing to her .
well , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry , dan .
well , maybe it &apos;s not what we think it is .
or maybe if it is , maybe she &apos;s not gonna say &quot; yes . &quot;
after being rejected at blair &apos;s wedding ,
i don &apos;t think chuck would-- would ever make that move
unless he was sure of her answer .
well , then i wanna hear that from her .
oh ! oh ! sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
i know somewhere where we can dry off .
what are you still doing here ?
waiting for blair to change .
she left .
she went through serena &apos;s room to avoid you .
布莱尔跟丢了 抱歉
i should &apos;ve known we &apos;d have communication problems
when she stole my phone .
sorry to interrupt your diatribe ,
but , um , can you unzip my dress ?
don &apos;t worry . there &apos;s a slip underneath .
i just can &apos;t get it dry like this .
wh @-@ where was i with my diatribe ?
oh , right . communication .
she tells me that i never shut up ,
but she &apos;s the one that &apos;s always talking .
it &apos;s not like her to choose chuck and not say anything .
well , it &apos;s exactly like her , actually .
i &apos;m sorry ,
i just--i can &apos;t protect blair any longer .
all she does is lie and scheme ,
and she &apos;s done nothing but hurt you all year .
i thought she &apos;d changed .
she &apos;s never gonna change .
don &apos;t you see , dan ?
the blair that you &apos;re in love with isn &apos;t the real blair .
it &apos;s the one that you created in your book .
and she &apos;s always loved chuck .
she just used you to get between us
because she knew that i loved you .
sorry to bother you before your press conference ,
but you said you wanted to be honest moving forward .
i want nothing more .
was there a problem with the annulment papers ?
oh , i was just surprised , uh ,
you didn &apos;t mention them when we spoke .
that &apos;s because rufus brought them by after i saw you .
i just assumed
it was because you &apos;d decided to stay married to him .
i was only trying to honor your wishes , so ...
i should &apos;ve known you &apos;d lure her here .
how &apos;d you do it ? sob story ? diamond necklace ?
i should get to the press conference .
i &apos;ll give you two some privacy .
how dare you have annulment papers drawn up behind my back .
i tried to call you . you didn &apos;t answer .
i wanted to give us a chance to work things out
before bart started causing problems .
our problems long predate bart &apos;s return .
you haven &apos;t spoken to me in weeks .
you &apos;ve h--you &apos;ve had no interest in working on our marriage
until you saw this as a competition with him .
he &apos;s manipulating you to choose him .
well , you &apos;re wrong .
he signed the papers .
it &apos;ll be my choice who i stay married to , not yours .
i am pleased to announce that bass industries
will now truly be a family business
with the return of the man who taught me never to give up ,
even on the dead--
my father , bart bass .
thank you , son .
thanks , mom .
i &apos;ve made my choice . i know who i need to be with .
i &apos;m on my way to tell him now .
of course , none of this would &apos;ve been possible
without my son chuck .
so thank you , chuck , for keeping my seat warm .
so starting today ,
i will be the only bass
in bass industries .
thank you . any questions ?
some secrets even i couldn &apos;t see coming .
bye @-@ bye , baby bass .
i thought that went well .
what &apos;d you want to discuss ?
you said this was a family business .
what happened to us being partners ?
you said partnership .
i said nothing
and did what was best for my company .
the only reason this company still exists
is because i saved it .
all i &apos;ve done is work to protect your legacy .
and pine after blair waldorf .
blair has nothing to do
with the way i &apos;ve handled this business .
you didn &apos;t try and trade her for a hotel deed ?
you didn &apos;t let everything fall apart when you ran away from her
all the way to europe ?
you didn &apos;t just three months ago almost bankrupt yourself
trying to get her out of her marriage ?
i had hoped you had outgrown such foolish behavior ,
but you &apos;re still willing to throw everything away
for a girl who &apos;s done nothing but toy with you .
and you proved that when you took that engagement ring .
you gave me it .
you encouraged me to win her back !
it was a test
to see if you were ready to be a bass ,
to do the things you need to do to be a great man ,
and you failed .
failed ?
i got you out of hiding .
i took down your enemy .
i built this empire !
no , no , no , no , the most you have done
is used my money to redecorate .
bass industries needs to be run by a man ,
not a boy .
you &apos;ve never grown up .
maybe you can start now .
well , that was definitely not what i expected to happen tonight .
not that it--it was bad . it wasn &apos;t .
oh , don &apos;t sound so surprised . we were always good together .
yeah , we were , weren &apos;t we ?
here .
that &apos;s weird . your camera &apos;s on .
uh , no , no , it &apos;s not .
whoa , i think it was recording us , actually .
oh , gosh !
maybe i @-@ i hit the button when i was cleaning up the spill .
here , let me erase it .
布莱尔走丢了 抱歉
you had penelope keep blair home ?
you knew that she wasn &apos;t with chuck the whole time .
no . no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not true .
she was spotted at the empire . you saw that yourself .
you manipulated me into thinking that i was over
so i would cheat on her .
oh , come on , dan , we both did this .
what were you gonna do with this ?
you gonna--you gonna post this video on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
i gotta get out of here .
wait ! look , blair really did choose chuck .
布莱尔回恰克那里了
i don &apos;t know who you are anymore .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t need your pity .
i &apos;m not here because i pity you .
i &apos;m here because it &apos;s time i was honest with you .
i love you .
i &apos;m in love with you .
i have tried to kill it , to run away from it ,
but i can &apos;t and i don &apos;t want to anymore .
so what ?
so now we can be together .
isn &apos;t that what you want ?
it was ,
before i lost everything .
bass industries isn &apos;t everything .
i &apos;m gonna take over my mother &apos;s company , and ...
it can be our future .
the only reason waldorf designse hasing future
is because i gave mine up for it .
my father was right .
i always put you first ,
and you bet against me every time .
now i have nothing .
you have me .
that &apos;s not enough .
i need a future .
then let me be part of it .
i don &apos;t want to be mr. blair waldorf .
i &apos;m chuck bass .
poor b.
now that she &apos;s revealed what &apos;s in her heart ,
guess these diary &apos;s days are dead ,
along with her happily ever after .
i &apos;m off to meet jack .
turns out my father cut him out of the company , too .
i &apos;m not surprised .
but are you sure you wanna partner with the guy ?
i need resources if i &apos;m going to get back
what i built and my father stole .
nobody does resource management
better than a vengeful jack bass .
good luck .
i &apos;ll see ya .
you sure you don &apos;t wanna come tour the northwest with me ?
a little fresh air might be good after your last few months .
i would love to hang out with you and nature ,
but i have worked too hard on &quot; the spectator &quot; to leave it now .
so ...
well , i should go then .
i have to finish all the paperwork
to donate cece &apos;s estate before i fly out .
wait . where did you decide to leave the money ?
i found a worthy cause .
well , at least an annulment will be easier than a messy divorce .
you sure about this ?
i can only have one marriage ,
and this just isn &apos;t one anymore .
you okay ?
that didn &apos;t sound too easy .
well , it &apos;s , um , a lot easier
knowing how supportive you &apos;ve been .
we both have a lot of making up to do .
i look forward to continuing the process
this summer in the hamptons .
i &apos;m busy .
i never meant for you to get caught in the crossfire
of my battle with blair .
i deleted the video , so no one knows about it
and no one got hurt .
and please don &apos;t act like you &apos;re innocent here .
i mean , it was mutual . we both used each other .
i was trying to escape my own pain ,
and you were trying to destroy your best friend .
those are two different things .
i &apos;m sorry for how it happened , but i love you , dan ,
and i don &apos;t think that you would &apos;ve done what you did
if you didn &apos;t still have feelings for me .
and now there &apos;s nothing standing in the way of us .
serena , there is no &quot; us . &quot; there &apos;s only you .
and--and now that our parents are splitting up ,
i never have to see you again .
the french say ,
&quot; plus ca change , plus c &apos;est la meme chose . &quot;
sounds romantic .
hey , can you meet me ? i &apos;m on my way .
but all it means is ,
&quot; the more things change , the more they stay the same . &quot;
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
you have no idea how many signatures it took
for me to get you this money .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
cece gave it to you . i &apos;m just giving it back .
well , thank you .
if you ever need anything ...
after lily sabotaged my mom &apos;s defense ,
i just need you to keep our agreement .
take down lily .
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
but i thought you were giving away your money
so you didn &apos;t become like the rest of your family ?
i &apos;m not .
you are .
outsiders remain on the outside ...
at least for now .
that is your third sigh since the seventh arrondissement .
are you having regrets
about leaving without speaking to serena ?
not at all .
those were &quot; i love paris &quot; sighs .
i can &apos;t wait to start
discussing heel heights and hem lengths .
good .
i wanna be sure that you &apos;re ready for this .
you don &apos;t have any loose ends to tie up back home ?
nothing &apos;s holding me back anymore .
i know what i want , and i &apos;m gonna get it .
the queen b. ascends to reign over a new kingdom ...
number 24 black .
blackjack .
puts us up $ 3 million .
two more and we &apos;ll be able to buy our way into the only game
that can really help us take down bart bass .
as long as the pit boss doesn &apos;t make you for counting cards .
place your bet .
stay at 17 .
and the wild cards just keep getting wilder .
this came from diana payne .
thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
mm . dan humphrey .
come to whisk me away
for a rendezvous under the tuscan sun ?
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re on my free pass list .
otherwise , philip might &apos;ve put up a fuss .
this invitation isn &apos;t about seduction , georgina .
it &apos;s about scandal .
can &apos;t a girl have both ?
i need your photographic memory
and your passion for social upheaval
to help me write the book about the upper east side--
the book i should &apos;ve written from the beginning .
mm , nothing like a scorned lover to scorch the earth .
i can hardly wait .
but even the same characters
can start to play a new power game ...
and old stars can cease to shine .
s always said she wanted to be left alone .
now she &apos;ll get her wish .
damian sent me .
do you have what i asked for ?
damian said you like to party .
i &apos;m zeke , by the way .
i don &apos;t care what your name is .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
serena van der woodsen doesn &apos;t exist .
is there a seat available ?
yes . take mine .
thanks for the call .
you fought for me all year .
i &apos;ve come to fight for you .
will you be joining the game ?
you said i always bet against you ,
but this time , i &apos;m all in .
your bet , sir ?
what did i say about letting the chips fall where they may ?
see you next fall .
