intimacy is a four @-@ syllable word
for , &quot; here are my heart and soul .
please grind them into hamburger and enjoy . &quot;
it &apos;s both desired and feared ,
difficult to live with ...
uh , excuse me ! excuse me !
... and impossible to live without .
is that my toothbrush ? !
intimacy also comes attached to three rs
relatives , romance and roommates .
coffee ?
there are some things you can &apos;t escape .
and other things you just don &apos;t want to know .
hello , kitty .
you don &apos;t understand . me gonads , you ovaries .
that reminds me . we are out of tampons .
you &apos;re parading to the bathroom in your underwear
when i &apos;m naked in the shower .
can you add it to your list ?
what ? !
tampons !
to the list . it &apos;s your turn .
i am a man ! i don &apos;t buy girl products !
i don &apos;t want you walking in while i &apos;m in the shower ,
and i don &apos;t want to see you in your underwear .
it doesn &apos;t bother me , ok ?
look at me in my underwear , george .
take your time . it &apos;s no big deal .
you are the first person they see in the morning .
you say please . you say thank you .
you apologize for waking them up .
you make them feel good about you .
why is that important ?
&apos;cause then they &apos;ll talk to you and tell you what &apos;s wrong .
why is that important ?
because then you can tell your attending
what they need to know during the round
and why is that important ?
because if you make your resident look bad ,
she &apos;ll torture you until you beg for your mama .
now get out there ,
i want the first round done by 5 : 30am .
morning , dr. model .
dr. evil spawn .
ooh , nice tat .
they airbrush that out for the catalogs ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do they do for the 666 on your skull ?
i &apos;d better get good patients today .
yesterday i had two guys with colostomies
who needed dressing changes every 15 minutes .
i &apos;m gonna be in surgery . today &apos;s my day .
on what ?
like i &apos;d tell you .
what do you know ?
i know that i was here at 4 : 00 , and you didn &apos;t get here untill 4 : 30 .
tell me .
no .
i &apos;m not the intern who &apos;s screwing an attending .
i am not screw ...
you &apos;re here early .
i have a chordotomy at 5 : 00 . i &apos;ll be out at 6 : 00 .
i thought i might buy you breakfast before your rounds .
i &apos;ve already eaten .
what &apos;d you have ?
none of your business .
you a cereal person ?
straight out of the box ? or all fruit and fibery ?
pancakes ? do you like pancakes .
fine , leftover grilled cheese .
curiosity satisfied ?
that &apos;s sad . it &apos;s pathetic .
a good day starts with a good breakfast .
look , i &apos;m not being seen with you in this hospital .
learn it , live it . it &apos;s unprofessional .
think of it as an attending getting to know one of his interns .
he barely knew her .
he slept with the intern .
and it &apos;s just stay that way .
you want me to be professional ? i &apos;ll be professional .
that &apos;s what i want .
that &apos;s what you get .
you &apos;re gonna be late for your chordotomy .
nice talking to you , dr. grey .
anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission ?
you always come in like that , bang the light on ?
you &apos;re elizabeth fallon ?
what does my chart say ?
it says you used to be a nurse here .
a scrub nurse .
now you have abdominal mass
consistent with pancreatic cancer .
oh , and you are hoping they &apos;re gonna give me a whipple .
pancreatic duodectomy .
this hospital sees those one ...
maybe once every six months .
i guess it &apos;s why you get here 4 : 30 , huh ?
4 : 00 .
grabbed my chart before anybody else could see it .
impress dr. burke with your pre @-@ round exam
so you &apos;d be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in .
ha @-@ ha ! i know all the tricks , doctor .
yang . cristina yang .
i &apos;ll call you cristina .
you call me nurse fallon .
mr. humphrey ?
mr. humphrey , i &apos;m sorry to wake you .
come on .
what time is it ?
ten after five
i &apos;m sorry . i just need to do a brief exam .
if you could sit up for one moment .
thanks .
this might be a little bit cold , so just take a deep breath .
if you could just take a deep breath .
you &apos;re not a doctor .
i &apos;m dr. stevens . you can call me izzie .
i &apos;ll be helping dr. bailey with your biopsy this morning .
no , i don &apos;t think so , no .
mr. humphrey , this will just take a moment .
no , get me dr. bailey
or dr. victor
i just need to do a brief ...
you don &apos;t need do anything
is this you ?
huh ? is this you ?
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , get out of my room .
mr. humphrey ...
get out of my room .
there need to be some rules .
so , what , we can walk around in our underwear
on alternate tuesdays
or you could see bras not panties
or are you talking amish rules ?
because if you think you &apos;re gonna get izzie to cover herself ...
the amount of flesh exposed is not the point .
you have to do something . it &apos;s your house .
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s house .
meredith ...
do you like izzie ? is that what this is about ?
do you have a crush on izzie ?
izzie ? no . i don &apos;t like izzie .
izzie ... no .
i ... she &apos;s not the one i &apos;m attracted to .
not the one . so there &apos;s a one .
this is not ...
look , there just have to be some rules .
o &apos;malley , grey , get karev and head down to trauma .
shepherd needs you .
shepherd &apos;s in surgery .
he got pulled before he could start .
those look like ...
nails .
亲密法则
i can &apos;t see my hands .
oh , my god . he &apos;s conscious .
breathe deeply , george . you won &apos;t pass out .
use 4 milligrams of morphine .
titrate up to 10 if you have to .
you know what ? i don &apos;t want him to move .
i can &apos;t see .
it &apos;s ok .
we need you to be very still , mr ...
cruz , jorge cruz .
he tripped and fell down a flight of stairs holding a nail gun .
somehow he managed to miss a blood vessel
that &apos;s a minor miracle . optic nerve &apos;s been affected .
can you feel this ? numbness on his right side .
what &apos;s our immediate concern ?
infection .
right , i wanna be puling these nails out in the next half @-@ hour .
i need a ct .
cts are down .
what ?
they exchanged them out last night .
computers crashed haven &apos;t back by 1 : 00
it &apos;s not typical . so what are the options ?
mri .
no , brilliant .
the man &apos;s got nails in his head .
let &apos;s put him in the giant megnetic way .
you want films from three axis
points and a c @-@ arm in surgery
exellent . you guys dig up research and find out if
this has ever happen before , go
my wife . my wife , my wife .
she is on the way .
you wife is on the way , mr. cruz .
stay with him , keep him calm and look for changes .
i can &apos;t see .
fifty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old woman with
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas .
has had radiation therapy to reduce the tumor load .
rates her abdominal pain three out of ten .
positive nausea , but no vomiting .
diarrhea , hematochezia , melena
afebrile with t @-@ max 37 @-@ 2
and stable vital signs .
lab significant for a total ability of seven
and elevated liver enzymes .
thank you , dr. yang .
aggressive little witch , isn &apos;t she ?
she stole my chart during pre @-@ rounds
so she could scrub in on my surgery .
she &apos;s hoping for a whipple .
well , actually , liz , i was gonna give you to meredith grey .
ellis &apos;s daughter ?
yes , she &apos;s an intern this year .
thought you &apos;d have something to talk about .
oh , i doubt that .
i was ellis &apos;s scrub nurse for 18 years ,
practically lived with that woman .
i didn &apos;t meet that daughter once .
anyway , shepherd has her on the guy with the nails in his head .
there &apos;s a guy with nails in his head ?
seven of them .
shot himself in the head with a nail gun .
&quot; nail &quot; nails ?
sixteen pennies , three and a half inches long .
i mean he &apos;s still alive ?
fully conscious .
should be a pretty interesting surgery .
but i guess you &apos;ve got the whipple .
i &apos;m gonna need a full blood work @-@ up and abdominal ct .
cts are down this morning .
then an mri .
she needs an enema ,
an ercp for a stent
and brush biopsy this afternoon .
take care of her . liz is an institution around here .
good call , doctor .
grey &apos;s got the human two @-@ by @-@ four ,
and you have the institution in need of an enema .
you &apos;d say your health &apos;s been good recently ?
maybe some headaches .
nothing compared to now .
sona , that &apos;s my wife .
sona , she &apos;ll say ,
&quot; why you think they call it a gun , moron ? &quot;
she hates the damn things .
with good reason .
baby ?
sona .
you are in so much trouble .
get a history from her before you scrub in .
ok .
thank you .
twenty @-@ three .
people have been accidentally shot
in the head with nails twenty @-@ three times .
one was attempted suicide , doesn &apos;t count .
oh , so he pointed a nail gun at his head on purpose ?
that makes me feel better .
so , uh ...
grey and stevens really walk around in their underwear ?
not all the time .
i mean , some of the time , you know .
but not all the time .
sexy underwear ?
yeah . i mean ...
and they just , uh , let you look at them ?
well , uh ... yeah .
like sisters .
no , well , not like sisters .
i don &apos;t think of them as sisters .
but they &apos;re not coming on to you .
not exactly .
they don &apos;t expect you to do anything .
no .
but ...
like sisters .
just like sisters .
is he prepped ?
i think they &apos;re doing it right now .
you think ?
he &apos;s having a prostate biopsy .
trust me .
if you &apos;d been in there , you &apos;d know .
ok , mr. humphrey . we &apos;re gonna get started .
get her out of here .
i want her out of here ! just get her out of here !
just you go ! now ! just go now !
hey , relax ! relax , mr. humphrey .
will he be able to see again ?
we won &apos;t know until the nails come out .
did he tell you he takes photos ?
beautiful photos . it &apos;s his hobby .
i just got him a new digital camera ,
and now he can &apos;t .
he always has it out , always taking pictures of me .
jorge said he &apos;s been having headaches .
can you tell me about them ?
have they been recent ?
i &apos;m not sure . maybe the last couple of months .
have you seen him experience any
dizziness or disorientation ?
yes , yes , i have .
ok .
you want to tell me what that was all about ?
nothing .
he &apos;s probably just crazy or something .
bethany whisper .
what ?
bethany whisper .
i did a new bethany whisper lingerie ad .
he saw it in a magazine .
you got time to pose in magazine .
no , the shoot was last year . it just came out .
so because he saw you in a thong ...
no , it wasn &apos;t a thong .
... you &apos;re hiding in the hallway .
might be easier if you assign another intern .
easy is not in your job description .
you are a doctor . he is a patient .
he &apos;s your patient . biopsy these .
if they come back positive , i expect to see you in surgery .
hey , you &apos;re on this . you understand me ?
vertiginous or light @-@ headedness ?
light @-@ headed .
sometimes he &apos;d have to brace himself to get out of bed .
could be a million things .
simple orthostasis .
what ?
what made him fall with a nail gun ?
he said he tripped .
just because you hear hoofbeats , don &apos;t assume zebras .
something caused him to lose
consciousness and fall down the stairs .
he could have a tumor .
look , i have no idea why this guy &apos;s still alive ,
let alone moving and talking .
not a clue . let &apos;s just get him through this
before we start digging around for something else .
shepherd . twenty @-@ three cases ?
one was attempted suicide .
that doesn &apos;t count . talk to me about the procedures .
the biggest problem is bleeding and infection .
odds improved with shorter surgery time .
bottom line was get them out quickly and watch for bleeding .
i got it . other words , i &apos;m on my own .
you coming ?
dude , i don &apos;t need an escort .
go .
go ahead .
well , well , well .
dr. bethany whisper .
that &apos;s so nice .
she had this thing for red when we met .
red car , red dresses , red hats .
personally , i hated the color . too obvious , you know ?
but a couple years ago ,
i took her up to the mountains .
she was in a red dress ,
and there was this field of red ...
... poppies , i think .
and she jumped out of the car
and ran into them
and started laughing ...
... laughing at all the red .
the good news is it hasn &apos;t spread
from his prostate to his lymph node .
with a radical prostatectomy ,
we could probably get it all .
good prognosis .
spare some nerves ?
give him a chance at a normal sex life ?
young puppies like to take chances with cancer .
old dogs like me , we do what works .
yes , sir , of course .
we have our schedule tomorrow ?
yes , 10 : 00am .
good . maybe i can squeeze in a round .
an ass who deals in asses .
we call him &quot; limp harry . &quot;
he never spares the nerves .
as you can see , the patient has shot seven nails
directly into the skull without doing significant damage
other than the optic nerve , and we may be able to save that .
the idea is to remove the nails
at exactly the angle they entered .
any wiggle , and we risk
doing more damage than when they went in .
where are they ? move over .
they &apos;re just pulling them out .
hey , i heard you got a whipple .
a maybe whipple .
burke is running my butt off .
oh , man . look at those films !
it &apos;s hellraiser .
small increase , then it will stabilize .
gelfoam .
here you go .
there goes the third grade .
dr. yang ...
... did you put in the blood work ?
oh , right before i got here .
hmm . take her to radiology for the mri .
beep me when you &apos;re done .
you want the whipple , right ?
yeah .
here . my share of the grocery money .
when are you going ?
tonight .
seriously , george . please don &apos;t ...
yeah , could we not talk about it here ?
what , tampons ?
did you not hear a word i said ?
you &apos;re a man . we know .
talk about shrinking the salamander .
i have always divided surgeons into two categories
those that remember the names of their patients
and those who didn &apos;t .
they all remember their surgeries , of course .
every damn suture .
but the good ones remember the names , right ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
now , some of the best ones ,
you know , distance themselves on purpose .
they believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine .
hi , liz .
hey .
but ? i &apos;m waiting for the &quot; but . &quot;
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a big , fat qualifier coming .
hey , liz .
hey !
looking good .
oh , you liar .
how you doing , honey ?
oh , fabulous . just fabulous .
hey , liz .
hey .
hey , liz .
bleeding ?
it &apos;s clean .
all right . way to go , team .
good job , everybody . thank you .
i don &apos;t think we made it worse .
the big question is the optic nerve .
we &apos;ll know in the morning .
should i order the mri ?
he needs to stabilize . we &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
one of the most amazing things i ever saw .
is it over ? hey , is it over ?
yeah , it &apos;s over .
hey , does burke have a whipple scheduled ?
dr. burke , i wanted to know if you &apos;ve seen fallon &apos;s labs .
i have .
they &apos;re getting worse .
the stent doesn &apos;t seem to be helping her jaundice .
no .
should we be doing something ?
we are .
i know you didn &apos;t have the whipple on the board .
do you want me to schedule one for you ?
i want to see the results of her biopsy ,
and have a look at overnight labs .
overnight ?
you &apos;re on @-@ call , right ?
um ... sure , yeah .
well , good . stick with her .
you &apos;re doing the surgery , right ?
you &apos;re still doing the whipple ?
the woman has pancreatic cancer , dr. yang .
we &apos;re gonna do something .
ok .
ok .
kiss the baby for me .
get some sleep , liz .
ok . good night .
see you later , honey .
bye @-@ bye , liz .
bye @-@ bye . take care .
i &apos;ll catch up with you guys later .
i &apos;m gonna check later .
oh . your mom &apos;s a bigger woman .
you were her scrub nurse .
liz fallon . come in .
meredith grey
she wanted me to send her regards .
that doesn &apos;t sound like her .
excuse me ?
well , the ellis grey i know
didn &apos;t have regards for anyone except ellis grey .
but you know that already , don &apos;t you ?
where is she now ?
traveling .
traveling ?
yeah .
is she practicing ?
not so much .
doesn &apos;t sound like her , either .
she was all work , just like me .
she never left the hospital .
but you know that , too , don &apos;t you ?
is she well ?
she &apos;s fine .
good .
just wanted to send her regards .
take care .
yeah .
i think these were taken at the old house .
there &apos;s you in your scrubs .
who is that ?
that &apos;s dad .
who ?
your husband . thatcher grey .
you called him thatch .
thatch .
that &apos;s the red wagon he got me for my birthday .
i &apos;m about four years old in this photo .
this is your family .
sure , sure .
i saw liz fallon at the hospital today .
liz . i love her .
how is she ?
is she still a scrub nurse ?
she was excellent .
i reminded you before you went .
i forgot when i got there .
no , no . you were so passive @-@ aggressive .
naked . i am naked in the shower .
they &apos;re just tampons ,
george . i really needed tampons .
god !
i &apos;m not riding in the same car with him .
unless you &apos;re going like that ,
you &apos;re not riding with me .
where are the tampons ?
he didn &apos;t buy them .
you didn &apos;t buy them ?
men don &apos;t buy tampons .
you are gonna have to get over the man thing , george .
we &apos;re women ! we have vaginas ! get used to it .
i am not your sister !
grilled cheese again ?
cold pizza .
is he awake ?
even better .
really ? let &apos;s see what his nurse says .
hi , sona , jorge . how are you this morning ?
tell them what color my dress is , jorge .
i &apos;d know the answer to that even if i couldn &apos;t see .
we can go over there and check it out ...
it &apos;s not a problem at all .
let &apos;s do it . uh @-@ huh .
i &apos;m taking the elevator.and you take the stairs .
i was going to , anyway .
good .
hold it .
thank you .
what ?
you don &apos;t wake a patient like that .
what do i have to do to get through to you ?
cut me some slack .
i was on call last night . i didn &apos;t get much sleep .
oh , stop whining .
you &apos;d rather be here , and you know it .
what you got waiting for you at home ?
boyfriend ?
no .
a girlfriend ?
no .
a pet ? family ?
a bed .
we got plenty of beds here .
i don &apos;t feel sorry for you .
this is who we are. this is our lives .
you tell her , dr. burke .
can i talk to you ?
hey , come on , come on , come on !
let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s going on ?
excuse me . what &apos;s going on ?
george , stop .
oh , my god .
we have bethany whisper in our locker room .
oh , boy , i guess they do airbrush
out the tattoo , you don &apos;t think .
you want to see it ?
you really want to see it ?
fine .
let &apos;s look at that tattoo up close and personal , shall we ? !
and what are these ? oh , my god ! breasts !
how does anybody practice medicine
hauling these things around .
and what do we got back here ?
let &apos;s see if i remember my anatomy .
glutes , right ?
let &apos;s study them , shall we ?
gather around and check out the booty .
that put izzie stevens through med school .
have you had enough or should i continue ?
because i have a few more very interesting tattoos .
you want to call me dr. model ?
that &apos;s fine .
just remember that while you &apos;re sitting
on 200 grand of student &apos;s loans .
i &apos;m out of debt .
i &apos;ll take them down .
don &apos;t bother .
go !
can you tell me what you had for breakfast on monday ?
cheese omelet .
and on sunday .
and on saturday .
and on friday .
sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet .
it &apos;s the only thing he likes .
it &apos;s the only thing you know how to cook .
ok , well , things look good .
but i need jorge to get an mri this
morning to check for recedure bleeding .
ok ?
this is who i was .
it has nothing to do with who i am now .
i &apos;m a physician , a surgeon .
and i am just as qualified as
any other intern on this floor .
so , you &apos;re just gonna have
to get over your chauvinist crap and allow me to do my job .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a very good doctor .
then what is your problem ?
look ...
i fantasized about you ...
about the woman in this photo , whoever she is .
i &apos;m not proud of it , but it &apos;s a fact .
do you know what they &apos;re gonna do to me today ?
i have cancer .
and they &apos;re gonna lift up my legs
and expose me to the world
and cut out my prostate and my nerves ,
effectively neuter me .
so , is it so hard to understand
that i don &apos;t want the woman who &apos;s in that photo to witness ...
my emasculation ?
have you seen her overnight labs ?
i have .
did you check her liver panel ?
they &apos;re not good .
no , they suck . she &apos;s choking on bile .
she &apos;s jaundiced .
a very sick woman .
why haven &apos;t you scheduled the whipple ?
well , are you a surgeon now ?
i &apos;m her cruise director ,
pushing her around all day .
the woman is circling the drain .
we need to do something .
i &apos;ll take a look at her biopsy .
screw the biopsy .
dr. yang ...
enough .
you know ... i ... i ... you know what i think ?
i think you never intended to do the whipple .
i think this entire thing has been bull ,
and you &apos;re behaving like the only reason
the only reason she &apos;s in this hospital is to die .
there . that &apos;s a tumor .
it &apos;s midline near the hypothalamus .
damn .
best practice , probably to remove the tumor .
&quot; probably &quot; because i can &apos;t get it all .
ninety @-@ nine percent , but not all .
radiation and chemo ,
you &apos;re looking at maybe five to ten good years .
let &apos;s do it .
you haven &apos;t heard the downside .
see , the tumor is located in a part of your brain
where your memory and your personality resides .
and because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor ,
i have to cut out a lot .
jorge , you stand a good chance of losing your memories ,
of losing who you are .
is there any other way ?
the alternative is gamma or cyberknife treatment
with focused radiation .
it &apos;s less evasive .
there &apos;s little chance of memory loss or him losing himself ,
but it would only give jorge maybe three to five years .
three to five years ?
this is an incredibly difficult decision .
if you have any more questions or you need to talk to me ,
i &apos;m here , okay ?
hey .
i told my mother about you .
she remembers you very well .
of course she would .
ellis grey never forgot a thing .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s not really funny .
it &apos;s not funny , but ...
what &apos;s her diagnosis ?
alzheimer &apos;s ,
oh , god .
early onset .
and she doesn &apos;t want anyone to know .
no .
she &apos;s in a nursing home .
and i &apos;m the only person she &apos;ll allow to see her .
but if i know ellis grey ,
she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect .
you know my mother well .
what a bitch .
the woman &apos;s life was this hospital .
it was her home . it &apos;s a sweet thing for them to do .
it &apos;s a waste of a bed , and it &apos;s a waste of my time .
who are we talking about ?
liz fallon. they brought her here to die .
wouldn &apos;t you want them to do the same thing for you ?
no , i &apos;d want the doctors to do everything they could .
i want them to cut me open until the minute i die .
sometimes doing everything can be worse than nothing .
you are eight feet tall .
your boobs are perfect .
your hair is down to there .
if i were you , i would walk around naked all the time .
i wouldn &apos;t ... i wouldn &apos;t have a job .
i wouldn &apos;t have skills .
i wouldn &apos;t even know how to read .
i &apos;d just be ... naked .
it &apos;s makeup . it &apos;s retouching .
you get that we hate you , right ?
bailey again .
you know what , any patient who spanks his doctor &apos;s pictures
forfeits his rights .
you &apos;re seriously not gonna give up the prostatectomy , are you ?
izzie ?
oh , forget it .
you know , sometimes it is actually ,
you know , painful to be around you .
where the hell have you been ?
when i page , you answer .
it &apos;s not that difficult to understand .
o &apos;malley answered his page .
he &apos;s doing your prep .
if i hear the words bethany whisper one more time ...
i can &apos;t , ok ?
i just ... can &apos;t .
he doesn &apos;t want me in there .
no , what he wants is to not have cancer .
what he wants is to be saved .
you want to stay in the scrub room , that &apos;s your choice .
all right . i &apos;ll do my best .
jorge and sona want the surgery .
they want you to cut it out ?
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s their decision .
they were never gonna operate .
you could have told me .
what fun would that have been ?
think of it as a hazing ritual .
welcome ...
liz , don &apos;t talk . don &apos;t talk .
liz ? liz , stay ... liz , stay with me .
stay with me , liz .
sona ?
let &apos;s go .
right ... right down .
here we go . bag her .
push epi and atropine .
you got it .
somebody page burke .
i &apos;ll start ventilation .
start that line .
she &apos;s dnr .
one , two ...
she &apos;s dnr . do not resuscitate ! dr. yang !
come on , people ! push another epi ! come on !
you need to consider what you &apos;ll lose .
what good is five years
if he doesn &apos;t joke about your omelets .
and he can &apos;t remember seeing you in that red dress ?
it &apos;s still five more years .
you don &apos;t understand .
he &apos;ll be there , but he won &apos;t be jorge .
he won &apos;t even recognize you .
this is our business .
you have no idea what this will do to you .
isn &apos;t five good years better than ten bad ones ?
meredith , what the hell are you doing ?
she needs to understand .
i do understand .
you think that i &apos;m being selfish ,
that i don &apos;t want to give him up .
i don &apos;t .
this is jorge &apos;s decision .
and if that means ten bad years for me , fine .
i &apos;ll give him those years
because i will give him whatever he wants .
look , i am so sorry , sona . just please forgive her .
she &apos;s an intern , she ...
and if he doesn &apos;t remember me ,
if he doesn &apos;t remember what we are ,
he &apos;s still my jorge .
and i &apos;ll remember for us both .
ok , all right .
... five , breathe , one , two .
what the hell are you two doing ?
we lost pulse .
let her go .
where &apos;s that epi ?
let her go !
she &apos;s dnr . let her go down .
four , five . one , two ...
do not resuscitate .
it is on her chart .
all right !
let her go down .
let her go down .
where are they ?
he &apos;s resecting the prostate , coming up on the distal nerve .
you said , &quot; i am not your sister . &quot;
do you feel like i was emasculating you ?
no . no .
i &apos;m too masculine to be emasculated .
i &apos;m sorry .
guess you put dr. model to rest .
i guess i did .
dr. victor , i &apos;m sorry . but these are viable nerves .
we should save them .
it &apos;ll take at least an hour longer ,
and we might not get it all .
you know , they call him limp harry .
but his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good .
frankly , if you &apos;re worried about missing your tea time ,
i &apos;d be more than happy to finish .
dr. stevens .
can we help you ?
i &apos;m sorry , dr. bailey . dr. victor , i agree with her .
you just can &apos;t ...
you have to save the nerves .
what ?
the nerves , you have to save them .
dr. stevens , i can handle this .
you told me the most important thing
is giving the patient what they want .
what humphrey wants is his erection .
she &apos;s yours . you get her out .
can &apos;t do that , sir .
you know how these young puppies are .
i &apos;m going to tell richard about both of you .
you do that . in the meantime ,
let &apos;s pretend it &apos;s you on this table and give this a try .
dr. pinosky .
you ever called one ?
no .
call it , doctor .
time of death , 11 : 43 .
i wish there were a rule book for intimacy .
some kind of a guide
that could tell you when you &apos;ve crossed the line .
you can &apos;t lose it like that .
it would be nice if you could see it coming .
i &apos;ll get her .
let her go .
and i don &apos;t know how you fit it on a map .
we have to let her go .
of course , now you know every time he gets a rise ,
he &apos;ll be thinking of you .
you take it where you can get it ...
... and keep it as long as you can .
and as for rules ...
better not be using my toothbrush .
i &apos;m not .
maybe there are none .
maybe the rules of intimacy
are something you have to define for yourself .
