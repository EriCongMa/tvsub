i always said i &apos;d be happier alone .
i &apos;d have my work , my friends .
but someone in your life all the time ?
more trouble than it &apos;s worth .
okay . crib goes here .
apparently , i got over it .
changing table will go ... right here .
but you can &apos;t plan a baby room before you have a baby .
i mean , that-- you &apos;re gonna jinx the adoption .
no , the social worker wants to see where we live .
this is like a death trap .
i &apos;m trying to create a reasonable distraction .
hello .
janet , welcome .
how are you ? thanks for coming out .
oh , be careful . watch those nails .
perfect for a baby , right ?
i &apos;m gonna stop in the lab .
i &apos;ll see you after the intake , okay ?
okay . oh , god . i forgot it was the hobarts today .
it always bums me out
when we have an alzheimer &apos;s patient with young kids .
well , there &apos;s no shame in sitting this one out .
i can do the intake .
stop treating me like i &apos;m your wife .
on the trial , i &apos;m a colleague .
i &apos;m allowed to say it bums me out .
doesn &apos;t mean you have to feed me warm milk and run a bath .
treat me like a doctor .
right . sorry . okay . go do the intake , colleague .
shepherd , you got a minute ?
i need to talk to you about your trial .
oh , um ... well , i should get meredith .
i just got a lecture
on the failure to extend professional courtesy to one &apos;s spouse .
i think it &apos;s best you don &apos;t get meredith .
you &apos;re in-- in very good hands .
i still feel bad that i &apos;m not gonna be here .
for the surgery ? i &apos;ll be unconscious .
that &apos;s not when i &apos;m gonna miss you .
okay . then i guess i w--
you can feel bad about all the time that follows .
you know , when i &apos;m not under general anesthesia ,
and you &apos;re still not here .
you &apos;re halfway around the world ...
with arnold .
andrew .
excuse me ?
he &apos;s a rock star .
i kind of feel like the sound of an adoring crowd
should follow his name .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t ...
is that a compliment or an insult ?
i don &apos;t know.i guess
it depends on how you feel about rock stars .
okay , well , andrew is not a rock st--
okay , you know what ? can you stop that , please ?
it &apos;s starting to get annoying .
my wife &apos;s leaving . i &apos;m allowed to be annoying .
i &apos;m not a real wife ,
so that doesn &apos;t buy for a lot of bad behavior .
well , you &apos;re my real best friend .
what does that get me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be . go be happy ... with andrew .
you &apos;re impossible .
yeah , you , too .
meredith , tell me exactly what you did .
i can &apos;t tell you .
we can still fix this ,
but i need to know what you did .
if i tell you , it &apos;ll make it worse .
it &apos;s worse already . meredith--
listen , i @-@ i ... i love you ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
but i can &apos;t tell you anything .
you wanted to be treated like a colleague ?
i &apos;m gonna treat you like a colleague .
alex karev informed dr. hunt
that dr. grey tampered with my clinical trial .
she switched around the placebos and the drugs ,
probably invalidating ... my trial .
is this true ?
nothing i did has any effect--
tell me exactly what happened .
i can &apos;t do that .
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
you think the f.d.a. will get anywhere near this hospital ever again ?
meredith , look at me .
if this is wrong , if there is something going on ,
if karev is exaggerating ,
this is the part where you have to tell me .
this is the part where you have to deny the charges .
kick me off the study .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the study .
nothing i did changes anything .
but you &apos;re not denying it ?
i &apos;m gonna have to investigate what &apos;s going on here ,
but it looks to me like you just lost your job .
so they &apos;re probably gonna fire me .
are you happy ?
oh , come on . they &apos;re not gonna--
i want your crap out of my house by the end of the day .
what the hell was that ?
a 757 went down in the sound .
we &apos;re looking at about 200 injured passengers .
we &apos;re the designated crisis center .
families will be instructed to come here
to find their loved ones .
we are activating surge protocol .
dr. hunt is gonna be running the show .
it &apos;s gonna be chaotic . you need to listen carefully .
you need to stay focused . do not contribute to the panic .
now get to your stations .
dr. bailey , let &apos;s clear any beds that we can .
discharge or transfer .
okay , uh , grey .
all right , torres , you &apos;ll be with me .
kepner , set up the e.r. for triage .
other grey , i want you running the family center .
take over in the cafeteria . yang , blood bank .
uh , we might need a candyman .
dr. sloan will be our candyman .
let &apos;s be liberal with pain meds for our victims
and sedatives for patients that we are moving .
uh , avery , you can help him out . let &apos;s move , people .
what happened with meredith ?
cristina , i can &apos;t--
owen .
she tampered with shepherd &apos;s study .
invalidated the results . she destroyed the whole thing .
there was a plane crash .
they &apos;re gonna cancel your procedure
and try to send you home .
you need to tell them that you are a d @-@ 1 .
you don &apos;t need to be in pre @-@ op ,
but that you want to be moved to a regular room .
that way , when the hospital starts doing surgery again ,
you &apos;ll be first in the queue .
don &apos;t you have a plane--
wait . did they shut down the airport ?
no , but we &apos;re not leaving till it &apos;s over .
they need surgeons and trauma counselors .
these are your films . they &apos;re gonna schedule
your surgery at seattle presbyterian .
seattle pres can &apos;t take anymore .
start calling county . avery !
why &apos;d you give me that guy in the middle of a mass trauma ?
avery ?
the kid quit webber &apos;s study .
what kind of idiot decides
working with the chief of surgery
is too taxing on his schedule ?
he didn &apos;t quit because he thinks it &apos;s too much hard work .
he quit because he thinks the chief
has a shot at a harper avery ,
and he was worried that if his name was on it ,
it would kill webber &apos;s chances .
kepner , discharges .
yeah .
you know ,
she &apos;s the only one who ever gave a rat &apos;s ass about you ,
and now you might have destroyed her career .
you should find some skanky intern to love you ,
&apos;cause next time you &apos;re in a burning building ,
no one is handing you a glass of water .
please make sure you give us a cell phone number--
matthew ruiz ? do you have--
no one from the fligt has arrived yet .
as soon as we get any infor--
do you have a list of people
they &apos;re bringing to the hospital ? because we--
folks , it can take emergency services quite a long time
to move and identify people in a situation like this .
please just try to be patient--
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry . look , my wife was on the plane .
can you please just tell me--
sir ,
at this point , we don &apos;t have any information .
please just sign the sheets .
i &apos;d like to speak to your supervisor .
somebody that knows what &apos;s going on .
ma &apos;am , my supervisor doesn &apos;t have any information .
nobody has any information . please just sign the sheet .
dr. hunt , i had way too many drinks before i told you that .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean for--
not now , karev .
look , i told you that
because i didn &apos;t think she should be chief resident ,
not that she should be fired .
if you didn &apos;t think this through ,
then you are as dumb as she is .
you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
uh ... the plane was from baltimore ,
where my parents live .
i &apos;ve taken that flight , um ... with my son .
you want to come sit down with me for a minute ?
no , no , no . i can &apos;t , uh ...
there &apos;s too much , uh ...
okay . um ...
i &apos;m just gonna--
i &apos;m just gonna stand here for a minute .
is that all right ?
are you on any medications ? - no .
ever given blood before ?
nope .
any chance you &apos;re pregnant ?
mm ... i don &apos;t know .
when was your last period ?
not sure .
uh , what were you doing ,
um , last time you had to deal with tampons ?
like maybe it was st. patrick &apos;s day ,
and you ate , uh , four green doughnuts
and thought , wow , that &apos;s disgusting .
i must be hormonal .
oh , my gosh !
you &apos;re right !
except it was these gross cookies with green frosting .
but that was a while ago .
uh , i guess i had mine again around easter ...
&apos;cause i was all over the marshmallow peeps .
it totally works .
hey . w @-@ what the hell ?
it looks about 6 weeks to me .
i take it this wasn &apos;t deliberate .
no .
okay .
you want to talk about options ?
no .
officials say it &apos;s too early
to speculate on the cause of the crash .
but here &apos;s what we do know--
the flight originated this morning in baltimore
carrying 183 passengers and 18 crew members ...
still nobody ? oh , their families are going crazy .
what is taking so long ?
well , fishing 200 people out of the water is slow business .
you want to play &quot; angry birds &quot; ?
they &apos;ll do triage at the waterfront .
it takes time . actually , if they &apos;re taking this long ,
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of hypothermia . kepner .
oh , yeah . warm blankets , heated lamps ,
and heated i.v. fluids . got it .
you post chief resident yet ?
uh , no . not yet .
what &apos;s the holdup ?
the suspense ain &apos;t killing me . it &apos;s gonna be grey .
well , i thought karev made a great play for it .
a plane full of orphans--
that &apos;s pretty impressive .
ah , he &apos;s already decided .
you don &apos;t have to lobby for your boy .
karev .
i want a written account of exactly what you saw ,
every detail-- when , where--
look , sir , i @-@ i don &apos;t think that &apos;s--
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to know what you think . okay ?
need more sedatives .
the people we &apos;re transferring are starting to freak out .
you &apos;re a good man , avery .
lexie &apos;s yours .
take her . take care of her .
i &apos;ll stay out of your way .
i kind of already have her , but ...
thank you ?
you &apos;re welcome .
i need to talk to you .
you know , i think i &apos;m gonna order pizza .
if you want , i can get ...
i &apos;m pregnant .
cristina ...
i cannot believe this is happening .
i know .
i know it &apos;s complicated .
i know it wasn &apos;t supposed to happen like this , but ...
cristina , this could be something .
what ? no .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re doing this . do you hear me ?
cristina ...
no , no . i @-@ i am not this uh , uh , beautiful vessel
for all that might be good about the future .
i &apos;m not carrying your hopes and dreams . no .
i get to talk .
i &apos;m here . there &apos;s two of us .
we are a partnership .
can we just ... just think together ? is that okay ?
i know who you are . i know what you want .
i love you .
i don &apos;t love the incubating potential of your womb .
i love you .
why would i want to do something
that would make you miserable ?
do you think i love you more when you &apos;re miserable ?
do you think i @-@ i @-@ i want that ,
you running off to meredith ?
you think i &apos;m looking for more of that ?
but ... i think there &apos;s a way ...
no , no !
i still get to talk .
there is a way to make this work
without it ruining your life or derailing your career .
i don &apos;t want a baby .
well , you have one .
are ...
are you getting all life @-@ y on me ?
how late are you ?
that does not matter .
of course it matters .
okay , fine .
you tell me when life begins .
you know , i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t wait to hear this one .
i don &apos;t know . does it--does it have hands ?
i cannot believe you are doing this .
i &apos;m just asking a question .
i don &apos;t want one .
i don &apos;t hate children . i respect children .
i think they should have parents who want them .
i want them .
i want them , and maybe you could , too .
i believe ...
your life can be bigger than you think it is .
i know you can contain more than you think you can .
i &apos;m not saying we do this .
i am just saying , let &apos;s think .
let &apos;s see what kind of life we can imagine .
cristina yang ...
i imagine such a huge life for us .
this is an extremely serious accusation , meredith .
can &apos;t you tell me anything ?
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t . i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
talk to me .
how many patients are we talking about here ?
did this happen more than once ?
i can &apos;t say that either .
she can &apos;t say anything .
we &apos;re gonna unwind this , meredith .
karev is figuring out
what cases he was on when he saw you ,
he &apos;ll narrow down the dates ,
we &apos;ll know which patients ...
nothing i did changed the trial .
uh , fire me . do whatever you have to do .
look , you don &apos;t get to choose , okay ?
you don &apos;t get to decide who gets the drug or the placebo .
you don &apos;t get to decide what information the trial gets .
anything i tell you affects the trial .
if you don &apos;t know what i did ,
the trial stays blind .
the trial is over . you screwed me .
you screwed this hospital . and you screwed yourself .
this is your disease we &apos;re trying to cure .
or lou gehrig &apos;s disease ,
but i did this for you .
derek , it was adele .
uh , maybe i should put some i.v. fluids in the heater ,
warm them up ?
no .
but if people have been in the water for that long ...
april ...
but if we just--
no one &apos;s coming .
if it &apos;s taking this long , nobody survived .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , the protocol is fairly clear .
are you encouraging him to fire me ?
look , derek , i basically pressured her to do it .
you &apos;d have to fire us both .
i &apos;m gonna have to suspend you
so it doesn &apos;t look so bad .
the study ...
i need to turn the whole mess over to the fda .
let them figure out what to do with it .
i mean , i @-@ i can &apos;t . i just--
meredith ...
i don &apos;t know how to ...
i know .
emergency services has begun identifying bodies .
they &apos;ve given us a list .
the airline reps are on their way .
we &apos;ve got social workers here and more coming .
it &apos;s a long list .
each of you have families to inform .
so , uh , please be outside the cafeteria in exactly one hour .
you &apos;ll call one family at a time .
and you &apos;ll be assigned a room
to take them to and deliver the news .
it &apos;s gonna be a @-@ a long day .
that &apos;s it .
dr. hunt , you gave chief resident to kepner ?
it was supposed to be me or grey .
do you think anyone &apos;s gonna listen to kepner ?
it &apos;s gonna be complete chaos .
you think anyone &apos;s gonna listen to you ?
you just sold out the one universally liked individual at this hospital .
everyone is gonna hate you .
a chief resident &apos;s supposed to manage their peers ,
be a resource and a support . after what you did ,
do you think anyone is gonna come to you for anything ?
i was planning to give it to you .
and now ?
so it &apos;s possible that we &apos;ll never ...
that we just ...
we just won &apos;t get the treatment ?
it &apos;s a possibility , yes .
oh , my god . this isn &apos;t right .
we &apos;re so close .
he needs this . can you just ...
is it killing people ?
no .
so give it to him anyway .
i wish we could .
no . don &apos;t give me that .
you can and you &apos;re choosing not to .
audrey--
no . they say there &apos;s nothing they can do .
there &apos;s a drug in a box in this hospital ,
and you were on the schedule .
my children &apos;s father is disappearing .
give him the damn drug !
i could take a leave for six months or a year .
no , you couldn &apos;t .
yes , i--sure , i could .
they &apos;re not gonna fire me .
no .
stop saying no . i &apos;m telling you , i want this .
i can do this .
this does not have to be your problem .
it &apos;ll be my problem . you wouldn &apos;t even--
what , notice ? it &apos;ll be a baby .
i &apos;m not a monster .
if i have a baby , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll love it .
that &apos;s the problem .
that you &apos;ll love it .
that--that &apos;s a problem that we can work with .
i &apos;m sorry . are you laughing right now ?
no , no . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m not-- i just ...
i love you .
what is so-- are you even listening to me ?
yes . i &apos;m just trying to figure out
some kind of a compromise .
okay , but you know what ? there is no compromise .
you don &apos;t have half a baby .
i don &apos;t want one .
okay , i @-@ it isn &apos;t about work .
this isn &apos;t a scheduling conflict .
i don &apos;t want to be a mother .
cristina , do you love me ?
of course i do .
do you trust me ?
i ... y @-@ yes .
you &apos;d be a great mother . you would .
i @-@ i know you don &apos;t believe me , but it is true .
just sit with this for a little while ,
this terrible idea that you might love a baby .
just for me , sit with it--
did you even hear--
i mean , okay . why would i do that ?
because you love me .
you love me .
that &apos;s why .
three names .
i don &apos;t think i can do this three times .
one foot in front of the other .
oh , i &apos;ve got something that &apos;ll cheer you up .
sloan gave us his blessing .
well , that &apos;s not really right .
more like he gave you to me , which was nice .
are you serious ?
yep .
though i probably owe him a goat .
okay .
all right . let &apos;s do it .
is the schoman family here-- jessica and maxwell ?
jason schoman . he &apos;s our son .
i &apos;m dr. altman . will you follow me , please ?
they think it &apos;s good news .
elaine chen .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m dr. sloan . why don &apos;t you come with me ?
uh , gilda and miguel ruiz ?
this is a nightmare .
hi , i &apos;m dr. bailey . come with me , please .
i brought some pudding .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
i &apos;ve got a good nurse . she &apos;ll hook me up with pudding .
i know . it &apos;s just ...
oh , i just spent the last two hours
telling people that their family members were dead ,
and i needed to--well , i just wanted to say hi ...
or bye again .
i don &apos;t know . i--
i really tried to be a gentleman about all this .
but now you need to get the hell out .
what are you doing ?
letting you go was the worst thing i &apos;ve ever done .
it was the most painful thing i &apos;ve ever done ,
and i &apos;m a guy who has had 82 surgeries .
my threshold for pain is pretty high .
you need to get out .
i &apos;m not your best bud . i &apos;m not your security blanket .
i &apos;m a man who &apos;s in love with you ,
who waltzed you into the arms of
a damn knight on a horse .
so go to germany ,
and have little spaetzle @-@ eating children .
and please , for god sakes ,
leave me alone .
the cafeteria is pandemonium .
wailing people everywhere .
are you admitting anyone ?
no , we &apos;re signing in a few so we can give &apos; em sedatives .
that &apos;s about it .
e.r.
there &apos;s a survivor .
are you leaving ?
no , i didn &apos;t get fired .
i know that &apos;s disappointing to you .
my trial is about to disappear .
you really want to act like i &apos;m the bad guy here ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i know the fact that it is adele changes things for richard ,
but it doesn &apos;t for me .
oh , i understand that .
you couldn &apos;t possibly understand that .
if you were focused on the millions of people
with alzheimer &apos;s whose lives could &apos;ve been different ,
would &apos;ve been better because of this drug ,
there &apos;s no way in hell you would &apos;ve pulled this stunt .
how is it that you don &apos;t know the difference
between right and wrong ?
because i don &apos;t think
that things are simply right or wrong .
things are more complicated than that .
this was more complicated than that .
it &apos;s complicated that it was adele and richard .
it &apos;s complicated that we have a drug in a box
that could help her .
there &apos;s nothing simple about that .
i am very sorry that i messed everything up .
but i would do it again .
i don &apos;t know how to raise a child
with someone who doesn &apos;t understand that
there &apos;s a ... a right and a wrong in the world .
so now i &apos;m gonna be a bad mother .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re going with this ?
you &apos;ve been saying it for weeks .
maybe you &apos;re right .
okay .
maybe you &apos;re right .
i just need some time to think .
i just ...
i just need some space .
sarah gordon--g.c.s. of 6 , head injury
and multiple contusions to mid @-@ torso .
systolic 70s in the field .
unaccompanied minor ?
yeah , she was flying alone .
on my count .
one , two , three .
okay , i need x @-@ ray in here .
we need to shoot a c @-@ spine , chest , and pelvis .
abdomen &apos;s rigid .
i &apos;ve got the ultrasound .
large hematoma on the left temporal lobe .
breath sounds are equal .
folks , we &apos;ve got eyes .
sarah , i &apos;m dr. shepherd .

they &apos;re doctors .
you ever seen this many doctors before ?
hey , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re all here to take care of you , okay ?
hey , honey .
they found his body .
because his wallet was still in his pocket .
they said because the impact .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it was fast .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
there &apos;s no battery .
i &apos;m pushing the button . i don &apos;t hear anything .
honey , let me try , okay ?
the battery is dead . what are you gonna try ?
okay , okay , okay , okay .
ma &apos;am . can i help you ?
we have to call someone ...
but the cell phone &apos;s not working .
okay , well , we have phones that you can use . uh , jenny .
i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll do it .
why don &apos;t you take a seat ?
excuse me . is the gordon family here ?
the gordons ?
they found somebody ?
a little girl . unaccompanied minor .
they &apos;re operating on her right now .
thank you .
yeah .
we should go home , honey .
a little girl made it . she &apos;s alive .
i think we should stay .
she doesn &apos;t have anyone . her parents aren &apos;t here yet .
i think we should stay .
gilda--
if matthew had been ...
i would like ... to stay .
okay .
okay .
we &apos;ll stay .
i &apos;ll , uh ...
i will let you know how she &apos;s doing .
mer .
oh , the adoption lady &apos;s paging me .
derek &apos;s a.w.o.l.
he &apos;s not even speaking to me .
wait a minute . is it a true ?
what--what were you thinking ?
i was thinking that the chief &apos;s wife
was about to have saline injected in her brain
instead of a drug that could stop her
from being a gorked @-@ out lump .
derek &apos;s head almost exploded .
are they gonna fire you ?
i &apos;m suspended .
the chief backed way off when he found out it was adele .
i did what i had to do .
meredith--
and i couldn &apos;t live with myself if i &apos;d done anything different .
and karev is trying to ruin my life .
mer .
what did you say to her ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
janet , anything he says--
can you just shut up for one second ?
this isn &apos;t about that .
we &apos;re granting you temporary custody of zola ,
pending the completion of the petition ,
at which point , assuming all goes well ,
you &apos;ll be granted permanent custody .
and her doctor here says she &apos;s doing great ,
so you can take her home ...
today .
her incisions look fine . she &apos;s tolerating a normal diet .
she &apos;ll need neuro follow @-@ ups . she &apos;s still on antibiotics .
uh , here &apos;s a prescription for any pain meds she might need ,
but she &apos;s been fine the last couple of days .
do you have any questions about anything ?
meredith , do you have any questions ?
oh , hi . you done ?
uh , no , no .
i still have some more , uh , families .
uh , sorry i paged you . i just wanted to see your face .
i think , you know , something like this happens ,
you just ...
you want to be with someone that you love .
so we &apos;re booked on a 9 : 00 a.m. flight tomorrow .
let &apos;s just spend the night in some fancy hotel ,
just never get out of the bath .
what ? are you okay ?
derek , i understand that you don &apos;t want to talk to me ,
but this is important .
i need to talk to you .
i &apos;m your wife . you need to call me back .
does anyone know where there &apos;s a nurse
or an information person ?
she should be right back .
my daughter was in the crash .
they said she had to have surgery . are we supposed to--
you &apos;re mrs. gordon ?
yes . sarah gordon is my d--
they &apos;re still operating .
the doctors have been here every half @-@ hour .
they &apos;ll be here any minute .
say , would you like some coffee or--
i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it .
here , sit down . you must have been driving like crazy .
i ... i don &apos;t under-- are you--
we heard she was alone .
i thought , as a parent , if my child was here alone , i--
well , we all thought that
she should have someone pulling for her .
thank you .
that &apos;s incredible .
diapers ,
and swaddle blankets ...
and formula .
these little bottles are good for the diaper bag .
you have a diaper bag ?
no .
oh , we &apos;ll get you one . we &apos;ve got a few in the nicu closet .
you know , we have all this gear--
the parents come in , the baby doesn &apos;t make it ,
they--they don &apos;t want to see the stuff ,
so they just leave it behind .
now here &apos;s the pacifiers . she likes the green ones .
is your husband putting the car seat in the car ?
don &apos;t have a car seat . not even sure i have a husband .
surgeons , right ?

she went with her dad to visit her grandparents ,

you have to stop .
you gotta stop talking to me and checking on me
and talking to my boyfriend .
i love you ,
and i am always gonna love you .

i &apos;ll come back to you .
you &apos;re right .

i said you were right .

chief friggin &apos; resident . unbelievable .
i &apos;m sorry .
what ? don &apos;t be . you deserve it .
i &apos;m happy .
hi . can you take that for me ? thanks .
i have what i want .
it &apos;s been such a crappy year .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re both happy .
i can &apos;t believe they like me enough
to make me chief resident . they hated me for so long .
i can &apos;t believe i actually have friends here .
well , they &apos;re gonna hate you again .
it &apos;s now your job to boss them around .
you know how much they love that .
oh , god . is that true ?
that &apos;s true .
okay , so this is the house .
there &apos;s another house where you &apos;re gonna have your own room ,
but that , right now , is just wood and no walls ,
so we &apos;re gonna stay here for a while .
derek ?
okay . he might be a.w.o.l. he &apos;s had a bad day .
and he &apos;s a little ...
pissed off right now .
but we &apos;re gonna be fine .
so we had a big plan if this ever worked out .
we were gonna have a lullaby from malawi
to make everything feel homey for you .
to be honest ,
right now , i can &apos;t even think of an american lullaby .
lexie .
you know , a lot of people live here .
it gets kind of crazy sometimes ,
and it &apos;s usually not this quiet .
alex .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna be okay .
you and i , we &apos;re a team , right ?
we &apos;re tough . we have that in common .
i am very glad you &apos;re here .
i didn &apos;t think your first day was gonna be quite like this .
but i am gonna get it together ,
and we are gonna figure it out .
tell me how much you love me .
i ... i love you a very great deal .
a lot ?
you love me so much .
i want you to remember that .
i made an appointment to terminate the pregnancy .
i &apos;m sorry if this upsets you .
i &apos;m sorry if this isn &apos;t what you wanted .
but ... i cannot talk about it anymore .
i ... need to lie down . i feel like crap .
this is a marriage .
i tied my life to you .
you don &apos;t decide this without me .
do you see me standing here ?
my head is killing me .
you give in a marriage . you make sacrifices .
i &apos;ve made many , and i am asking you to do something for me .
can you simply consider doing something for me ?
have a baby ? this isn &apos;t pizza versus thai .
you don &apos;t give a little on a baby .
cristina , i am asking you ... - i am saying no !
get out .
are you ...
because i &apos;m denying you a baby , you &apos;re trying ...
because you denied me part of the decision ,
because you denied me a marriage .
oh , how dare you ...
get out !
i &apos;m gonna go .
i just wanted to say good night .
i want to come home with you .
oh , no . i can &apos;t . tuck &apos;s with me tonight .
i can meet your son .
i &apos;m not gonna bite your son .
no , it &apos;s just not the right time .
i can &apos;t--
this is a relationship . things today were bad .
we lean on each other when things are bad .
that information &apos;s not gonna hurt your child ,
and if it does , then this is not the right relationship for me .
okay .
i can control myself in your house .
i &apos;m not gonna touch you .
okay .
you just--you know , you could tell him i &apos;m your friend .
tell him whatever you need to ...
okay .
i was hoping you were derek .
sorry .
well , he took off ,
and the hospital gave me a baby .
she &apos;s upstairs sleeping in some dead kid &apos;s porta @-@ crib .
i &apos;m getting an abortion ...
and owen just kicked me out of my house .
what ? you &apos;re ...
pregnant .
and you &apos;re ...
getting an abortion .
well ... why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you had a busy , busy day .
there &apos;s a reason i said i &apos;d be happy alone .
come upstairs . i need help .
i ... i can &apos;t .
i gotta lie down .
it wasn &apos;t &apos; cause i thought i &apos;d be happy alone .
it was because i thought if i loved someone ...
and then it fell apart ...
i might not make it .
tell me not to go to africa .
alex .
go to hell .
it &apos;s easier to be alone .
because what if you learn that you need love ...
and then you don &apos;t have it ?
what if you like it
and lean on it ?
what if you shape your life around it ...
and then ...
it falls apart ?
can you even survive that kind of pain ?
losing love is like organ damage .
it &apos;s like dying .
the only difference is ...
death ends .
this ?
