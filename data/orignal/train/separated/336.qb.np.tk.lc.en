excuse me , ma &apos;am ?
ma &apos;am ?
well , it happened .
i &apos;m gonna hit a kid .
would you like to support my baseball league
for underprivileged youth ?
i don &apos;t see an underprivileged youth .
i see a young me trying to scam an old me .
sir ?
i &apos;m sorry , i have diabetes .
and i &apos;m not stupid .
move it along .
it &apos;s not a scam !
my friends and i just want to place
to play baseball after school
so we &apos;re not hanging on the streets like rap people .
kid , i started the candy scam .
i raised $ 500 for a homeless bowling league ,
aka pot .
catch this , mr. baseball .
not the face !
i think i know which team you play on ,
and it ain &apos;t baseball .
you still shopping on your phone for things you can &apos;t afford ?
who are you ? everyone in america ?
i just add things to my cart without buying them .
why not buy one apple watch when i can not buy two ?
it &apos;s called dry shopping .
so it &apos;s like dry humping , but you don &apos;t get anything ?
i &apos;m sorry , max ,
but tomorrow &apos;s the anniversary of when i lost my money
and my peaches @-@ and @-@ cream complexion .
not my words ; &quot; seventeen &quot; magazine &apos;s .
i need a fantasy life .
i mean , i just thought you were over all that junk .
you thought i was &quot; over &quot; losing $ 5 billion
and my whole life ?
i guess i was just over you talking about it all the time .
you need to let go of your past .
pickup ! turkey burger ... ish .
if you weren &apos;t so busy not buying a ...
three @-@ bedroom townhouse on the upper east side ,
you would &apos;ve noticed that mr. turkey burger at table ten &apos;s
been checking out your buns .
he is not . he is ?
get in there .
sex is still free ...
for women .
fine , i &apos;ll go over there ,
but this better not be a prank ,
like when you told me bette midler was at table three
and really wanted to meet me .
it was just some old jewish lady ,
and she was mean .
that was bette midler !
here &apos;s your turkey burger .
my friend thinks you &apos;re flirting with me ,
and you &apos;re obviously not ,
so if you could just tell her you &apos;re not ,
that &apos;d be great .
okay .
i will tell her i am not flirting with you ...
on one condition .
you go see a show with me tomorrow .
i feel tricked .
so ... is that a yes ?
i hope so ,
because i already wrote down my number .
um ... yeah , sure .
i mean , if it &apos;s already written down ,
i guess i have to go .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t notice he was flirting .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
let me get my list .
hi , everybody !
good news !
oleg and i are getting a surrogate to carry our baby .
yeah , doing it the other way was taking longer
than my stuttering uncle did to finish his s @-@ s @-@ s @-@ sentence .
sophie , i hope you &apos;re not thinking of me to be your surrogate .
just keep in mind ,
you won &apos;t even let me carry your purse .
you think i &apos;d hire a surrogate that &apos;s older than me ?
come on . no .
max is helping me interview people this week in my booth .
this is so exciting .
i wish i got to pick the person i grew inside .
my mom drank so much during her pregnancy ,
i was born wearing a shirt that says ,
&quot; it &apos;s 5 : 00 somewhere . &quot;
can we all just admit vaping is smoking ?
anyway , i &apos;m on the list for whatever this is .
channing , caroline .
there you are . the show &apos;s $ 20 .
my date put me on the list .
i &apos;m sure he paid for me .
he kind of pursued me pretty hard .
it is , again , a date .
well , then you &apos;re dating a loser ...
and you owe me 20 bucks .
what am i spending my last $ 20 on right now ?
it &apos;s a storytelling show .
people telling their personal stories .
it &apos;s basically a fun way to find out
which one of your friends had a stepfather
that was so mean .
in lieu of cash , would you accept a tampon ?
i have light , regular , super .
everything you don &apos;t feel on your period .
there is nothing funny about my cramps .
i don &apos;t get out of bed three days a month .
i &apos;ll go call a friend .
so by now i was in high school .
but just when i thought i &apos;d escaped my bullies ,
i met the worst one yet : puberty .
oh , god .
thanks for bringing the $ 20 , max ,
and sorry you had to spend another $ 20 .
it figures , on the anniversary of my father stealing money ,
i get ripped off by another guy .
well , i &apos;m getting that $ 40 back .
i spent more money tonight than i did in 2013 .
it was a high school dance ,
and rachel mooney , a popular girl ,
pulled down my pants .
that &apos;s right .
i got dance @-@ pantsed .
oh , this guy just went from tom cruise
to tom snooze .
in the end , what i learned
is that i &apos;m the painter of my life ,
and i can paint out what i don &apos;t want to see .
my brushes are mine .
my strokes are mine .
guess what &apos;s not getting stroked tonight .
old adam &apos;s paintbrush .
that &apos;s got to be sarcastic applauding , right ?
&apos;cause i feel like i heard , like , a question mark
at the end of the clap .
thank you , adam august .
that is the end of our show .
i &apos;d like to thank all of our performers .
you live the stories that we live to hear .
hey , caroline .
i know , that was pretty real .
it was real long .
so where are we going for dinner ?
your treat , and she &apos;s coming .
actually , i &apos;m pretty spent emotionally .
well , we &apos;re spent forty @-@ dollars @-@ ally .
it &apos;s just one of those nights where ...
you leave it all on the stage .
you happen to leave a couple twenties up there ?
let ... let me get something straight .
you gave all of yourself talking about a couple bullies ?
that &apos;s not a rough life . you know that , right ?
well , i know i &apos;m entitled to my truths
and how my truths make me feel .
yeah , but it &apos;s not like you lost a billion dollars
and your father went to prison and you had to move in with me .
and i am a way bigger bully than rachel mooney .
caroline has a rough story .
again , we can &apos;t compare our truths .
i &apos;m sorry , but did all that really happen to you ?
you lost billions ?
five years ago today , in fact .
and with what i lost tonight , $ 5 billion , $ 40 .
well , have you ever considered
telling your story in a safe space ?
you mean one of those locations where you can drop off a baby ,
no questions asked ?
n ... no . no .
no , i mean here .
telling your story here .
hey , you know what ?
i probably have some fans waiting for me outside ,
so i will leave you be .
you &apos;re still here ?
thanks for the offer , but i &apos;m not really a writer .
or a person who would come here twice .
plus , i &apos;m trying to put my story behind me .
all right . well , think about it .
it pays $ 50 . here &apos;s my card .
you work at avis ?
that &apos;s my other job .
and remember , you have a story to tell .
and sometimes renting a car is actually cheaper
than a long @-@ term lease , so ...
i think you should totally do this .
to finally tell my story and give it closure ?
yeah , a little of that , but mostly the 50 bucks .
i &apos;m here for the surrogacy interview .
max , we got another baby mama .
look at all these woman trying to get pregnant .
it &apos;s like nba all @-@ star weekend .
here &apos;s my resume , and do you validate ?
i &apos;ve never been validated , so you &apos;re not getting validated .
but i am impressed you have a car ,
so have a seat .
max , i &apos;ve been working on my life story for the show .
&quot; as a little girl , i dreamt of being a princess .
it wasn &apos;t until i lost everything that i realized ...
that &apos;s what i &apos;d already been . &quot;
what else you got ?
come on , max , this is important .
i &apos;ve never told the story about the day i lost my money ,
so it &apos;s all very raw .
okay , but just know ,
sometimes things can be too raw ,
like that chicken club sandwich that
buck @-@ kaw &apos;d at the table .
looks like my appearance
on the brooklyn small business podcast
really paid off !
these aren &apos;t customers , silly .
these are just women that will do literally anything for money .
will any of them wait tables ?
han , can i go work in your office ?
i just need to write my life story .
i promise i won &apos;t play with your legos .
you mean those little plastic men
protecting his virginity ?
sophie , ready to meet the next potential surrogate ?
oh , well , the lady in stall two is out .
yeah , i just heard her balls hit the water .
where is oleg ?
sorry , i was watching a youtube video
on how to make spaghetti .
boy , i was way off .
uh , sophie ?
this is claire .
you liked that her application was filled out in pink pen .
do you mind if i sit down ?
my back is killing me .
yeah , well , your front is killing me .
i mean , what the hell ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re aware of this ,
but your &quot; no vacancy &quot; sign is flashing .
yes , but once i give this gift
to a lovely same @-@ sex couple in tribeca ,
i would love to carry your gift into the world .
i &apos;ve been a surrogate 12 times .
what are you ?
a baby pez dispenser ?
what do you get after 12 ? a free sub ?
next !
pregnant 12 times ?
must be like saloon doors down there .
i don &apos;t know .
are you sure you can &apos;t spend more than $ 200 on this thing ?
because i feel like it &apos;s reflecting
in the pool of candidates .
which one says , &quot; just because i &apos;m at my bottom
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t wear a nice top &quot; ?
even your shirts talk too much .
max can you be serious ?
no , but you sure can .
i read your story , and it is supes serious ,
so i took the liberty of putting some jokes in .
i mean , &quot; schindler &apos;s list &quot; was depressing ,
but at least there were still jokes .
you changed my life story ?
you got mustard on my life story ?
i added a few riffs and had a hot dog .
i think your story is really , really sad ,
and it &apos;s gonna bum people out ,
and that &apos;s gonna bum you out ,
and that &apos;s gonna bum me out .
well , as i said to mrs. shearson ,
who directed me in &quot; cabaret , &quot;
i don &apos;t know how i could be much better ,
but i &apos;m open to your ideas .
all right , let me hear some of your funnies .
all right , first of all ,
we &apos;re gonna sit han in the front row ,
and you &apos;re gonna say ,
&quot; i &apos;m gonna keep this short , &apos; cause this guy did . &quot;
hold for what i have to imagine is a five @-@ to ten @-@ minute laugh .
okay , all through this first section ,
you &apos;re driving right through snoresville ,
and then you take a slight right into who @-@ gives @-@ a @-@ crap @-@ town .
the point is you &apos;re driving a 2016 ford bore @-@ us .
all right , fine .
i &apos;ll put some of your jokes in .
oh , but i don &apos;t want to attack anne hathaway .
hasn &apos;t she been through enough ?
and after it was all said and done ,
i looked at my vagina ...
and my vagina looked at me ,
and we shared a knowing glance .
it was as if she was giving me permission to tell her story .
thank you , vagina .
and thank you for listening .
i never thought i could get tired
of hearing the word &quot; vagina , &quot;
and yet , here i am .
hey , tips are kind of low , huh ?
how &apos;d you like to make $ 200 , possibly $ 250,
to have my baby ?
what ?
you carry stuff anyway .
just as well .
i didn &apos;t want our baby to have that hair color .
where &apos;s that waitress going ?
i need a double .
a double what ?
double anything .
how &apos;s everyone doing out there ?
isn &apos;t this a wonderful way to spend a friday night ?
i &apos;m up next .
on a scale of 9 to 10 , how do i look ?
you look beautiful ,
so they &apos;re gonna be really surprised
when you have jokes .
and our next storyteller is here for the first time ,
reading a tale so epic that it should be two tales .
and like the two @-@ tailed melusina ,
a serpent of european folklore ...
she is truly a beauty .
what in good god is that man talking about ?
please welcome caroline channing .
as he said , my name is caroline channing .
that used to mean something special ,
and i have learned through the past few years
that it still does .
my father was martin channing ,
the most hated man in new york city .
except for any time warner cable guy ...
you know what ? i don &apos;t need to look at this .
i know what happened .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
you don &apos;t forget the day that you lose yourself .
oh , boy .
she &apos;s off script .
she &apos;s gone rogue .
where &apos;s that waitress ?
double his double !
as my driver drove down 5th avenue
and up to my townhouse ,
i saw there was a police car parked out front .
and at first , i thought , &quot; am i being arrested ? &quot;
lip @-@ synching to ludacris at a stoplight !
but it was my father being arrested .
i saw my father in handcuffs .
there , in that instant ,
i went from princess to pariah .
well , she threw away a perfectly good
&quot; pariah carey &quot; joke .
just looking out for my girl here .
my perfect world was shattered .
i saw the man who i trusted ,
who i believed in more than anyone ,
who read me bedtime stories
and taught me how to tie my shoes with bunny ears ...
i saw my father in handcuffs .
he stole my trust ,
my belief in people ,
my innocence .
if she doesn &apos;t say &quot; virginity , &quot; i am leaving .
he stole who i thought i was
and left me to find who i really am .
thank you .
nothing ?
we got to sneak her out the back door .
you were so sad and triumphant
and ... so ...
oh , here come the waterworks !
caroline ,
i know you said you never would ,
but you touched me .
that really tugged at my heartstrings ...
or cables or wires
or whatever &apos;s in here keeping me alive .
caroline ...
oh , you know what you and i both need ?
a hug . yeah .
it &apos;s nice , isn &apos;t it ?
caroline , that was great !
i &apos;m so glad i inspired you with my awesome story .
you &apos;re still here ?
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t do your jokes , max .
you know what ? you didn &apos;t need them !
i think people sometimes like to be sad .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s adele .
i think i finally got closure .
it &apos;s gone , max .
love you .
love your story .
thanks .
i &apos;m nina spiegel .
i found the whole thing riveting .
the ups , the downs , the way @-@ downs .
ugh , your story had it all .
she &apos;s not joining your threesome .
sorry , that &apos;s usually what women want when they compliment me .
look , i &apos;d like to talk about taking this to my studio .
you have your own studio apartment ?
let the wooing continue .
no , it &apos;s a film studio .
warner brothers .
the tasmanian devil warner brothers ?
i think we can turn your story into a movie .
really ?
the caroline channing story
deserves to live on the big screen
for one to two weeks .
then on demand for eternity .
oh , my god .
max , isn &apos;t this exciting ?
i know !
they have speedy gonzalez too !
i &apos;m still on hold , max .
i know nina &apos;s important ,
because her assistant has put me on hold six times
and muted me twice .
muting you &apos;s an option ?
why wouldn &apos;t they put that in your manual ?
hi !
oh , are you kidding ?
i love waiting .
sophie , here &apos;s your consolation gnocchi ,
for not finding somebody to get gn @-@ knocked up .
oh , thanks , oleg .
well , at least i have you .
you know what , sophie ?
i &apos;ll be the surrogate ,
but if my pregnancy boobs knock over a street lamp ,
that &apos;s on your insurance .
that &apos;s real nice of you , max ,
but if there &apos;s anything that i learned from caroline &apos;s story ,
it &apos;s that you can &apos;t give up , even if you should .
oh , so you &apos;re gonna keep trying ?
no , we &apos;re gonna adopt ,
and we will cherish this little baby ,
even if it &apos;s not technically from us .
yeah , oleg &apos;s right .
i mean , half my hair &apos;s not from me ,
but i love it just as much as if it were .
they are flying me to hollywood !
they want to bring me out first class
for a meet @-@ and @-@ greet .
but i told them no .
are you crazy ?
you can &apos;t pass up a meet @-@ and @-@ greet .
you can &apos;t pass up any kind of meat .
you &apos;re anemic .
i switched the tickets for two coach seats .
i want you to come with me !
who needs to lie flat
when i can be squished between my best friend
and an obese rabbi in row 36 ?
we &apos;re going to hollywood !
