名流嘉宾们不来了因为我们只管一晚住宿

coming to the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart to laugh at the losers
who forgot to bring parade supplies !
which reminds me , we need parade supplies .
parade jerky .

beef , turkey or pork .
it all tastes like a delicious shoe tongue .

that you could wear for free .
i &apos;ll pay ! i &apos;ll pay !
leading the parade

chuck , ernie , and arturo are there for you .
this ad was a bad call , man .

i &apos;m not sure , but i doubt it .

you know the kind of things they &apos;ll do to me at the dentist ?
well , there &apos;s only one other way .
you have to promise never to prank again .

apu , it &apos;s good to see you doing so well .
i know you can &apos;t turn your head ,
but you &apos;ve got a great view .
are you okay ?
marge , he &apos;s got nine lives .
i am a hindu , sir , not a cat .
i have infinite lives
during some of which i may be a cat .
in those i do have nine .
apu , face it .
our store is ruined .
this is painful , but i no longer want
the customers to , &quot; come again . &quot;
i want to work somewhere else .
i see . nurse !
transfer this man to the mental ward .
okay .
listen to me , when i was hit with the sign ,
that was a sign .
i &apos;m through .
how can you abandon me , brother ?
well , the way we abandoned our other brother .
what other brother ?
all i remember on that boat was you ,
the tiger , and the wise , old fox .
the ... oh , my god !
the fox was actually tikku .
oh , sweet , little tikku , i blocked out the memory .
oh , no !
tikku !
yes , well , i have given
my share of the store to my son , jamshed .
he will rebuild while you recuperate .
little jamshed .
oh , how he &apos;s grown .
indeed , first in his class with a business degree from wharton ,
and he is ready to take my place de @-@ gunking the cheese warmer .
all right , my brother .
i will especially miss looking into
your tired , sunken eyes during our wordless shift changes .
remember when we used to nod ?
i do , i do .
it is down to just you and me now , store .
together , nothing can stop us .
unless they put another store within three blocks ,
which i hear they plan to do .
and now to lower this photo to see what is really there .
there , we gave him one last look at it .
roll away the photo .
quick &amp; fresh ?
who spells &quot; quick &quot; with a &quot; q &quot; ?
hey , uncle apu .
jamshed ?
come on , man , jamshed died at band camp .
i &apos;m jay now .
yup . check it .
i just bitch @-@ slapped your kwik @-@ e @-@ mart into the 21st century .
an upgrade ?
no !
i will just live in the happy past one moment longer .
disco stu is in denial with you .
check it out , uncle a.
i made this place healthy .
i added softer lighting .
we &apos;re even getting a better class of robber .
i &apos;m afraid i must relieve you of your spare cash
and a nice bottle of gin .
ah , mrs. peel , shall we ?
okay , those guys are cool ,
but still , jamshed-- i @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , jay--
i know my customers .
all they want is something they can eat while driving .
i &apos;d like a heat lamp dog , please .
somewhere between two and six blisters .
i &apos;m sorry , we don &apos;t serve those anymore .
they &apos;re a heart attack shaped like a penis .
why , you , millennial ...
easy , brah .
check out our olive bar .
ha , see , he doesn &apos;t care what he eats .
he just eats things in that location .
hey , quit talking like i can &apos;t hear .
this is my store .
mine and sanjay &apos;s .
my father &apos;s enjoying his retirement .
bubba watson !
you are no vijay singh .
don &apos;t forget , my dad owned more of this place than you did .
oh , you , i can &apos;t ... i ...
okay , can we move this discussion into the restroom ?
you have a restroom ?
no .
no .
i saw the whole jam from my seat
on top of the atm machine .
you know what , i &apos;m not gonna scratch this last one .
a smart man knows when to walk away .
one paid @-@ for ticket and all the rest were losers .
they say don &apos;t scrape where you eat , but ...
that ticket won the biggest scratcher payoff
in kwik @-@ e @-@ mart history .
$ 25 .
whoop , don &apos;t mind me .
but that was the last winner he saw .
he scratched and scratched , using ... this .
is that the same dime ?
it started as a quarter .
he was hospitalized briefly with scratcher &apos;s lung .
each time , he paid my dad back
with another piece of the store .
so , sanjay-- and now i-- own 80 %
of the quick &amp; ficky @-@ fresh and rising ...
come on , big bang theory scratcher .
bring me back to break even .
sheldon , sheldon ...
oh ! wolowitz .
always olowitz .
bart , chalmers is sunbathing nude under a beehive .
sorry , man , i &apos;m retired .
now to present my manhood to the sun .
there he is .
no more pranking .
but ...
do you know how much imagination
it costs to appear in a thought bubble ?
sorry , milhouse , can &apos;t .
and you know what ? a little part of me is glad
that chalmers &apos; crotch isn &apos;t covered in bees .
really ?
let &apos;s put this good bart to the test .
thank god , the department of homeland security
financed this cherry picker to detangle the flag .
extend , extend .
all this extending is making me thirsty .
just smash the window ,
unlatch the brake ,
and skinner plummets to his hilarious doom .
now he &apos;s safer than ever .
yup , you &apos;re officially springfield &apos;s bad boy now .
and i am up to the task .
dad , we &apos;re taking apu out to cheer him up .
this time , please watch the kids .
how about you pay me like a real sitter ?
another one of your nonsensical , rambling stories .
i &apos;d like to get paid .
in corn cob pipes , right ?
because in 1967 , you and ...
just get going .
dad , check out this &quot; a &quot; i got in citizenship .
sorry , boy , late for dinner .
i know exactly how you feel , bart.
this family isn &apos;t the greatest at recognizing achievement .
wow , now i understand why you &apos;re so mad all the time .
i really do .
aw , thank you , bart.
hey , you want to go move our mouths without speaking
to drive grampa nuts ?
i &apos;d like that .
what the ... ? speak up .
oh , i guess i &apos;ll just have to turn my hearing aid
up to the max .
another ... hey ! another chianti , please .
uh , maybe you should slow down a little .
oh , yes , because it will take all of my faculties
tomorrow to affix my name tag right side up .
ooh , there he is .
the so @-@ called marketing genius
who increased revenue over 500 % .
please , don &apos;t make a scene .
but if you do , bring back bread .
oh , hey , uncle .
aren &apos;t you going to introduce me to your friends ?
what , are you embarrassed by me ?
um , well , yes , a little .
you are ashamed of me ?
me , who has been as loyal to you
as gunga din to sergeant archibald cutter ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
you &apos;re my uncle , bruh , and i love you ,
but you &apos;re a stereotype , man .
: take a penny , leave a penny .
i &apos;m indian . i do yoga .
why don &apos;t you go back to the temple of doom , dr. jones ?
temple of doom ... three months i worked on that
and all you can see is my hand in one shot .
big whoop . thank you very much , mr. spielberg .
and @-@ and i say that you are a stereotype .
all you do is spout stupid , hipster buzzwords .
swipe left on that accusation .
epic swipe left .
well , my dear nephew , this stereotype will no longer
be a troublesome potato in your chicken vindaloo .
good luck to you .
stereotype @-@ a ?
who &apos;s a stereotype @-@ a ?
that &apos;s a spicy accusation .
you pipe @-@ a down .
hello ? hello , anyone here ?
hey , brah , come in and chillax .
uh , i came in for the new issue of toes and torsos ,
but , uh , that can wait .
what &apos;s going on here , my friend ?
oh , i lost my store and my identity ,
and all i have left is my vest here .
330 million gods and not one of them listens to me .
what are you doing ?
i leave for one second ,
and you &apos;re talking like a mumbai riverboat pilot .
bombay ! to me it will always be bombay !
not cool , man .
give me your vest .
no , please , you can &apos;t take it .
this vest has a bullet hole for every time i have been shot .
it is my lucky vest .
i love you , man , but you &apos;re fired . &quot; fo @-@ evah . &quot;
amateur .
whoa , whoa , whoa , apu , you need a visit to moe &apos;s tavern ,
your downward spiral headquarters .
hey , we &apos;re on the cover of this month &apos;s giving up magazine .
check it out ,
that was the last issue ever .
hey , guys , this is too sad .
we @-@ we gotta help apu get his store back .
yeah , okay , let &apos;s see , uh ,
homer , your boy &apos;s no good , right ? not much .
well , why don &apos;t you ask him to pull a prank to help apu
turn his nice , new store here back into a rat hole ?
well , i kinda straightened him out .
i was hoping he &apos;d stay that way till the marines take him .
you can &apos;t think of yourself , homer .
apu &apos;s always been there for us .
yeah , except for that hurricane when he jacked up the prices .
okay , so i got a little gouge @-@ y ,
but i @-@ i don &apos;t hold the looting against you guys .
some looting .
i got there late , and all that was left was a bag of ice ,
and they played the clip on cnn for a week .
but i am one of you now .
i sponsor your little league teams ,
and i sell you christmas gifts
on 9 : 00 a.m. on christmas morning .
yeah , that hello kitty cell phone cover
really saved my ass with marge ,
and when i think of it , what do we have children for
if not to sacrifice them for our needs ?
hear , hear .
hear , hear .
oh , gee , i guess you guys
are gonna have to buy more beers .
ba @-@ bart ?
bart ?
ba @-@ bart ...
oh , leave me alone .
listen , boy , i need you to do a prank for apu .
i don &apos;t get it , man .
you told me to stop pranking , and i did .
and you know what ?
i don &apos;t miss it .
without you strangling me , my throat is finally healing .
i can sing again .
* praise god from whom all blessings flow *
* praise him *
* all creatures here below *
you know what , you &apos;re right .
what was i thinking ?
go back to sleep .
dad .
yes ?
say someone were to do this prank ,
would the prankster receive a later bedtime ?
say 9 : 30 ?
no , no , you know something , boy , i realized i made a big mistake .
i like the new , well @-@ behaved you .
i can stop saving up for that house near the prison .
oh , i never should have bought
that clockwork orange video for his fifth birthday .
i thought it would help him tell time ,
and now i &apos;ve awoken a monster .
you awoke me , too .
i thought you were sleeping over at rachel &apos;s .
rachel was my imaginary friend when i was three .
then when she was five , she moved to white plains , new york .
what ? i never said good @-@ bye .
well , they wanted to leave quickly .
her dad had been caught in an affair .
her brother took a semester off college ,
and he never went back .
and her mother ?
her mother &apos;s the really sad story .
oh , i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve heard enough .
my return to prankdom is elegant in its simplicity .
all we do is cut the power in the store for 30 seconds .
and no preservatives in the food ,
so everything will immediately go bad .
oh , it &apos;s an honor to be the guy you explain it to .
bart , wait !
i like the new you .
listen , before you flip those circuit breakers ,
look deep in your sister &apos;s eyes and tell me what you see .
i see ... love .
unconditional love .
which means i can do whatever i want .
ah ! save us , chemicals !
at least the mushrooms are okay .
that is a wheel of brie !
come on , this is the cleanest place in town ,
and you know it .
another failed millennial .
who is a cliché now ?
now to remove all signs of our presence .
we must have used it up during the parade .
mm , it was a great parade .
aw , let &apos;s get out of here !
* you &apos;re simply the best *
i am sorry , nephew .
i was jealous , and karma has exacted a terrible price .
word . and i was kind of a douche wheel .
you know , even your way of apologizing offends me .
what is this ?
my ruin and my redemption .
my last two dollars .
i have nothing to scratch it with .
留下一分钱
use me , apu .
make my life worth something .
no , uncle a , it &apos;s a clown move , bruh .
or maybe , just maybe , a genius clown move .
sheldon ,
sheldon ...
three sheldons !
it is a winner , and it is so much money ,
which means so many more tickets .
precious , precious tickets .
i ... no , no , it &apos;s money .
oh , it is so good to see you .
i have my store back , my friend .
but i have something that i wanted even more , you know ,
a feeling that i belong .
i &apos;m glad i could help by giving my son a little nudge
in the wrong direction .
and now , i have something very , very special for you , my friend .
this is the legendary , jumbo , golden squishee cup .
it will be refilled by me ,
for free , for the rest of your life .
holy moly , all those squishees ?
how much is that gonna cost you ?
ah , about three bucks .
this time it &apos;s &apos; cause i let ralph drive .
i thought it was pretend .
let it never be said i cannot admit a mistake ,
especially in the middle of a recall campaign .
we will now destroy the new jebediah springfield statue .
chief , you may fire when ready .
damn it !
