morning .
hi .
how was your date ?
pretty good .
oh , good .
my god . sorry about that .
okay , really good .
i gotta go . i &apos;m late .
you &apos;re going to leave her with me ?
don &apos;t worry , she &apos;s a terrific girl .
can you do me a favor ?
could you mention i &apos;m not looking for a relationship ? that &apos;d be great .
what , are you kidding ?
just casually slip it in , you know . lay the groundwork .
tell her i &apos;m a loner . no , an outlaw .
she doesn &apos;t want to get mixed up with the likes of me .
that &apos;s a lot to remember .
can &apos;t i tell her that you &apos;re a pig ?
i &apos;m gonna call her later myself .
honest .
chandler used to do it . he &apos;d make her pancakes .
he &apos;d make extras and leave them for me .
i &apos;m not telling her anything . it &apos;s not my responsibility .
fine .
now , where did we land on those pancakes ?
hi .
hi .
sorry , but i couldn &apos;t get that lock to work .
yeah , joey kind of disabled it when i moved in .
you must be rachel . i &apos;m erin .
hi .
i don &apos;t mean this to sound like high school , but did he talk about me ?
would you like some pancakes ?
the one with ross &apos;s library book
come on . why are we here ?
okay , okay , take a guess .
the hot chicks ?
okay , okay , i was typing names into the library computer earlier ...
... you know , for fun .
and i typed mine in , and guess what came up .
my doctoral dissertation .
it &apos;s right down here in the biggest library in the university .
wow , that &apos;s actually pretty cool .
there &apos;s also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina .
what is that ?
sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system .
we &apos;re so sorry .
you didn &apos;t bring me here to do that , did you ?
she sent the chicken back again ?
she said it &apos;s too dry and wants to explain to you how she wants it .
i &apos;d like to meet this chicken expert .
send the colonel in .
oh , my god !
lucky bastard .
janice .
how are you ...
... ms. hotshot @-@ chef @-@ at @-@ the @-@ big @-@ fancy- restaurant @-@ with @-@ the @-@ best @-@ chicken @-@ ever ?
i &apos;m fine .
oh , what is that on your finger ? i &apos;m blind .
somebody &apos;s been doing a little cooking outside the restaurant .
so who &apos;s the lucky guy ?
funny story .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
hey , who &apos;s your friend ?
hey , joey .
erin .
you &apos;re still here .
we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time .
why wouldn &apos;t you ? erin is great .
and then there &apos;s you guys .
well , listen , i better get going .
today was great . thanks .
and , joey , last night was fun .
yeah . i &apos;ll call you .
i &apos;ll call you too .
or i &apos;ll call you .
and call me .
okay .
look at that , we &apos;re all gonna call each other .
good to see you again .
bye @-@ bye .
bye .
the system kind of broke down , huh ?
joey , i &apos;m sorry . i just couldn &apos;t tell her all those things .
and we got to talking , and i ...
we want you to marry her .
what ?
she is so amazing . you have no idea .
who do you think brought her here ?
cupid .
she &apos;s so cool . she speaks four languages .
man , do you know what guys want .
come on , she &apos;s so perfect for you . she &apos;s sweet .
she likes baseball . she had two beers at lunch .
my beers ? !
look , she &apos;s a very nice girl .
we had a very good time , but i don &apos;t see it going anywhere .
you always say that .
maybe if you gave her a chance , it would go somewhere .
i &apos;m sorry , you guys . i just don &apos;t think so .
whatever .
fine .
hey , don &apos;t start judging me .
you &apos;re in love with your assistant .
you &apos;re having an affair with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof .
phoebe !
secret affair .
what did i say ?
hey , cutie @-@ cutie .
so i ran into someone you know today at work .
oh , yeah ? who was it ?
oh , my god .
i am so sorry , sweetie .
are you okay ?
you didn &apos;t tell her we &apos;re engaged ?
she saw the ring .
did she freak out ?
she was shocked , but then again , so were most people .
she actually has a boyfriend herself .
name &apos;s clark .
she also invited herself to our wedding .
clark too .
you said no , right ?
you said no , right ?
she cornered me . she asked me if the wedding was in town .
what was i supposed to do ?
lie .
how hard is that ? &quot; your check &apos;s in the mail . &quot;
&quot; oh , your baby &apos;s so cute . &quot;
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to read your book , ross . &quot;
so she comes to the wedding . maybe it won &apos;t be so bad .
think she &apos;ll sit quietly ? think she &apos;ll want to make a toast ?
you don &apos;t think she &apos;ll want to sing &quot; part @-@ time lover &quot; ?
oh , my god . she &apos;s not gonna like the chicken either , is she ?
you know what ? it &apos;ll be okay .
she &apos;s probably not gonna even want to come .
really ?
no , that was a lie .
see how easy that was ?
so you would have just lied ?
yes .
it would have really been that easy ?
yes .
do it saturday . we &apos;re having dinner with her and clark .
hi .
what &apos;s wrong ?
people are doing it in front of my book .
i &apos;m sorry ?
my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school . i went to see it .
and there were students making babies right in the paleontology section .
oh , my god . did you get to see anything good ?
that &apos;s not the point .
i know that &apos;s not the point .
i &apos;m trying to make it the point .
at your school ...
... was there a place on campus where students went to fool around ?
yeah , there was .
in the corner of the library where all the books were that nobody ever read .
yes , there was .
great , because people kept showing up . i think it &apos;s like a thing .
hold on a second .
fifth floor , against that back wall ?
oh , for crying out loud !
so we should go catch our movie .
what &apos;s the rush ?
i like to see the previews .
the candy .
oh , hey .
well , look who &apos;s here .
hey , joey .
hey , erin .
hey , rachel .
hi .
we were about to take off and see a movie .
oh , no !
what &apos;s wrong ?
phoebe , we forgot that party we have to go to .
oh , no .
what party ?
a birthday party .
a birthday party .
whose birthday party ?
alisors birthday party .
alisors birthday party .
and how old is alison ?
thirty @-@ two .
thirty @-@ two .
i feel so terrible ditching you like this .
no , that &apos;s okay .
wait a minute . why don &apos;t you guys do something ?
look how that worked out .
you want to catch a movie ?
yeah , sure . that will be fun .
guess i &apos;ll talk to you guys after alisors party .
that , actually , might go late .
i &apos;ll wait up .
excuse me . hi , i &apos;m a professor here .
do you know the paleontology section , fifth floor , stack 437 ?
well , yes . just give me five minutes .
i just have to find someone to cover my shift .
no , no , no .
can i speak to someone in charge ?
how can i help ?
hi , i was wondering , is it possible to increase security ...
... in the paleontology section ?
i wrote a book that &apos;s up there .
and instead of reading it , people are ...
well , they &apos;re rolling around in front of it .
we are aware of the problem you &apos;re referring to .
as far as increasing security , i &apos;m afraid the library &apos;s understaffed .
i can &apos;t help you .
well , fine .
if i &apos;m the only person with any appreciation ...
... of the sanctity of the written word , then i &apos;ll go defend it myself .
don &apos;t you follow me .
how did it go with erin ?
unbelievable .
we had the best time .
so you &apos;re not mad anymore ?
no , no . you guys were totally right .
this was much better than the first date .
that was awkward . we were both nervous .
didn &apos;t you sleep together ?
yeah , that calms me down .
and we have so much in common .
she loves sandwiches , sports . although she is a met fan .
not an issue now , but if we had kids ...
oh , my god ! listen to you talking about having kids .
oh , my joey .
please don &apos;t get married before i do .
i just cannot believe that clark stood me up .
he may still show up .
what are you , stupid ?
it &apos;s been three hours .
is that all ?
i just feel like such a fool . i thought this guy was my soul mate .
i thought i was your soul mate .
what am i doing ?
you know , let &apos;s just ... oh , let &apos;s forget about clark .
let &apos;s go on to happier things .
why don &apos;t you tell me about your lovely wedding .
there was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding .
it &apos;s going to be a small ceremony .
tiny .
we &apos;re not even sure why we &apos;re having it .
it &apos;s actually going to be just family .
oh , wait .
you two think of me as family ?
i have to ask you something now , and be honest .
do you want me to sing &quot; careless whisper &quot; or &quot; lady in red &quot; ?
how can you say that ? the mets have no closer .
what about benitez ?
what about game one of the series ?
what about shut up ?
you shut up .
i love arguing with her .
be right back .
okay .
so how &apos;s the second @-@ greatest love affair of the century ?
second ? who &apos;s the first ?
me and this muffin . my god , it &apos;s delicious .
how &apos;s it going with joey ?
oh , okay .
okay ?
tell me that you like him , please . i mean , tell me that you like him .
he &apos;s a really great guy , and i know you really want this to work out ...
... but i just don &apos;t see this having a future .
but you said that you liked him . what happened ?
did you just change your mind ?
kind of .
then change it back !
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , there &apos;s no real spark .
didn &apos;t you sleep together ?
yeah .
tramp .
does joey have any idea ?
i don &apos;t think he does . you know what ?
maybe you could tell him i &apos;m not interested ...
... in a serious relationship .
you mean , like , that you &apos;re kind of a loner ?
yeah , that &apos;d be great .
and maybe that you &apos;re a real stronzo .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i guess italian isn &apos;t one of the four languages you speak .
hey . want to go ?
yeah , let &apos;s go .
okay . see you guys later .
bye , guys .
hey , thank you so much .
wow .
i guess it wasn &apos;t cupid that brought her here .
no , just a regular old flying dwarf .
yes , yes ? how can i help you ?
we were just looking around .
oh , you &apos;re fellow scholars .
what exactly were you looking for ?
perhaps dr. chester stock &apos;s musings ...
... on the smilodon californicus ?
get out of here !
meeting someone ?
or are you just here to brush up ...
... on merriam &apos;s views on evolution ?
actually , i find merriam &apos;s views far too progressionist .
i find merriam &apos;s views far too progressionist .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
i &apos;m a professor here . ross geller .
ross geller ? why do i know that name ? it &apos;s a ...
wait .
did you write this ?
yes .
you &apos;re the person who checked out my book ?
you know , you look nothing like i would have thought .
you &apos;re so young .
well , i skipped fourth grade .
i am very , very sorry .
so how was your date ?
great . we walked around the village .
we went to this ice @-@ cream place . split a milk shake .
seventy @-@ thirty , but still .
i &apos;m thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts .
really ? she said she wants to go ?
no , it &apos;s a surprise . it &apos;s gonna be tricky because she &apos;s busy at work .
she said that ?
yes .
joey , don &apos;t you think maybe it &apos;s kind of quick ...
... for you to be going away together on a trip ?
not for me . no , i want to spend as much time with her as i can .
okay , honey . joey , we need to talk , okay ?
i got the feeling from her ...
... that she &apos;s not looking for a serious relationship .
where are you getting this ?
she told me .
she said she &apos;s kind of a loner .
joey ...
hey , rach , it &apos;s cool , you know .
i &apos;m a loner too , right ?
hey , joey . you know what ? you are way too good for her .
i promise , next time i will tell them you &apos;re not looking for a relationship .
no , don &apos;t do that . just ...
next time , make sure she likes me .
well , that too .
joey ?
do you want some pancakes ?
finally .
what are we gonna do ?
i say we go with &quot; careless whisper . &quot;
chandler ?
did she see us yet ? did she see us ?
janice , what are you doing here ?
i thought i was gonna go back to my apartment ...
... but i just felt like i really couldn &apos;t be alone tonight .
i was just wondering if i could maybe stay here with you .
just , i really feel like i need to be with family .
our kids are gonna call her aunt janice , aren &apos;t they ?
please . because otherwise , i really don &apos;t know what i might do .
aren &apos;t you just a teensy bit curious ?
do you have any tissues ?
yeah , in the bathroom .
we &apos;ll just let her stay .
no . if we let her stay , she will stay forever .
kind of like your barcalounger .
is that what you &apos;re thinking about ?
i never stop thinking about it .
what are we going to do ?
nothing . we &apos;ll just have to let her stay .
we can &apos;t . we gotta fight !
fight !
chandler , she has beaten me .
i &apos;m tired , chandler .
so very tired !
hey , you guys ?
do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath ?
janice , i &apos;m sorry ...
... but you can &apos;t stay here tonight .
why not ?
honestly ?
our apartment is a hotbed ...
... for electromagnetic activity .
monica and i have been immunized , but sadly ...
... you have not .
i &apos;m gonna need a comforter .
do you have a hypoallergenic one ? because otherwise i get very nasal .
do you have a cat ? because it &apos;s already happening .
do you hear that ? listen .
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! you have to go .
why ?
because chandler still has feelings for you .
he does ?
say again ?
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
and that is why you can &apos;t stay here tonight .
and probably why you shouldn &apos;t come to the wedding .
feelings . such strong feelings .
i mean , i realize that his feelings may never completely go away ...
... but you can .
oh , my god .
i understand . i am so sorry .
i &apos;ll go .
goodbye , monica .
i wish you a lifetime of happiness with him .
chandler .
you call me when this goes in the pooper .
i got this section covered .
yeah , in fact , i &apos;ve got this baby to shine in people &apos;s eye ...
okay , see you later .
