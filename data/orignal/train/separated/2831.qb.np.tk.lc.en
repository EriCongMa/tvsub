sorry i &apos;m late . did i miss anything ?
joey stuffing fifteen oreos in his mouth .
fifteen ?
your personal best !
where were you ?
on a date .
i met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate .
which museum ?
how &apos;d you meet her ?
no . answer his .
we were at the back of the train .
i sat near the door so she &apos;d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars .
she was totally at my mercy .
were you so late because you were burying this woman ?
i &apos;m late because she lives in poughkeepsie .
she seems great , but she &apos;s two and a half hours away .
how can she be great if she &apos;s from poughkeepsie ?
that joke would have killed in albany .
done ! i did it .
who &apos;s stupid now ?
the one with the girl from poughkeepsie
look ! they &apos;re lighting the big christmas tree tonight .
that paper is two weeks old .
who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash ?
i really wanted to take kathy to this .
i can &apos;t believe i missed it
at least you have somebody to miss stuff with .
i hate being alone this time of year .
next it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day , then my birthday , then bang !
before you know it , they &apos;re lighting that damn tree again .
i want somebody !
you know , i want a man !
it doesn &apos;t even have to be a big relationship .
just a fling !
i didn &apos;t think girls ever just wanted a fling .
let me tell you , it &apos;s been a long time since i &apos;ve been flung .
i know what i &apos;m giving you for christmas .
there are nice guys in my office . want me to set you up ?
i &apos;ve been single a long time . why haven &apos;t you offered before ?
i have a girlfriend . i &apos;m happy .
i no longer go out of my way to stop others from being happy .
okay.no accountants.and no one from &quot; legal . &quot;
i don &apos;t like boring jobs .
and ross was what ? a lion tamer ?
what &apos;s wrong , mon ?
everybody at work still hates me .
is it because of the review you wrote or something new ?
it &apos;s the review .
i was making headway.everyone was smiling at me , and then i get off work ...
... and find out they wrote this on my chef &apos;s hat .
maybe they meant to write &quot; quiet , bitch . &quot;
what &apos;s the matter ?
fine ! just trying to be nice .
i haven &apos;t been picked on this much since kindergarten .
and they brought in someone from junior high to do the see @-@ saw with me .
they &apos;re trying to make me quit .
if it were any other job , i would .
but i &apos;ve waited for this my whole life .
wait , you &apos;re the boss .
yell at them . or fire them !
i would love to , but i can &apos;t . i &apos;m not good at confrontation .
you know what you can do ? i read about this director , orson welles ...
... who , at the beginning , would hire somebody just to fire them .
then they would all know who was boss .
i &apos;m not doing anything . why not fire me ?
it &apos;s a good idea . can you waiter ?
good enough to get fired .
all right . you &apos;re hired !
that &apos;s why i got fired last week !
does orson welles direct commercials ?
yes .
i say , drew ? are you seeing anybody right now ?
i &apos;m not asking for me .
i &apos;m not gay . i &apos;m not asking you out .
i &apos;m not gay .
i didn &apos;t think you were gay.i do now .
my friend , rachel , wants to be set up .
i just got out of a big relationship.i &apos;m not looking to get serious .
that &apos;s okay . a fling might be all right with her .
is this &quot; hot rachel &quot; that you took to the christmas party ?
by the way , that is her full name .
wow ! i &apos;m free for her .
wait , i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t free .
let &apos;s talk it over at the ranger game .
hold on . i just got a box of cubans.i &apos;ll bring them by your office at five .
that &apos;s a little later than i usually stay , but sure .
before the game ,
we could enjoy some eight @-@ year @-@ old basil haydens .
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but that &apos;s a pretty nice jacket .
kind of like that tie too .
keep your pants on , man .
i &apos;m writing a holiday song for everyone . do you want to hear it ?
happy hanukkah , monica
may your christmas be snowy , joey
happy new year , chandler and ross
spin the dreidel , rachel
pheebs , that &apos;s great !
but you know , rachel doesn &apos;t rhyme with dreidel .
i know ,
but it &apos;s so hard . nothing rhymes with your stupid name !
what are you talking about ? lots of things rhyme with rachel :
bagel , mail , jail , bail , cable .
maypole .
all good . thanks .
do you , maybe , have a nickname that &apos;s easier to rhyme ?
didn &apos;t your dad used to call you &quot; pumpkin &quot; ?
pumpkin ? but did he ever call you &quot; budolph &quot; ?
hello , children .

oh yeah , i just showed this a picture of you
and guys were throwing themselves at me !
they &apos;re buying me drinks ! they &apos;re giving me stuff !

you know , i &apos;m going to play the field a little bit more
guys are signing over their 401 ks to me .

yes .
one guy , patrick , you &apos;ll like him .
he &apos;s nice , funny and a swimmer .
i like swimmers &apos; bodies .

i like credit cards !
i &apos;m not bad at this !
what does he do ?
he works in fine foods .
you have a fine foods division ?
it &apos;s a big company ....
now , wait a second . you make food and robots ?
no , the robots just work for them .

what will you do ? fire me ?
you bet your ass i &apos;ll fire you !
see you later . -thanks .
i should go . i &apos;ve got a date .
with who ?
you know the girl who lives in poughkeepsie ?
not her .
this is someone else.i can &apos;t decide between the two
the one from poughkeepsie , though two hours away , is pretty ...
... really smart and a lot of fun .
but this other girl , she lives right uptown .
she &apos;s just as pretty .
i guess she &apos;s smart.she &apos;s not fun .
if she &apos;s no fun , why date her at all ?
i want to give her a chance . she lives so close .
and , at the end of the date , she said something that ...
... if she was kidding , was very funny .
if she wasn &apos;t kidding , she &apos;s not fun . she &apos;s stupid and racist .
how was your first day at the restaurant ?
damn !
what happened to your fancy jacket ?
they baked it .
i can &apos;t take this anymore .
i &apos;m going to fire you tonight .
you got it .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re still on fire there .
i think you got it !
chandler , you have the best taste in men .
like father , like son .
patrick and i had such a great time last night !
this could , maybe , get serious .
i thought you weren &apos;t looking for serious . just a fling ?
well , you know , possibly .
you didn &apos;t tell him that , though , right ?
ummmmmmmm , no .
you told this guy that i was looking for a fling ?
you don &apos;t tell him that !
why not ?
i &apos;d be thrilled if some hot girl was just looking to get
i see .
you telling him i want a fling ...
... and me putting out on the first date
he &apos;s so going to get the wrong idea !
joey , could you pass the cheese ?
i &apos;d prefer you didn &apos;t call me joey .
i thought it might be fun to try out a cool nickname .
hey , dragon !
here &apos;s your tips from monday and tuesday .
there &apos;s $ 300 in this one .
people get generous around the holidays .
and it never hurts to wear tight trousers .
could the waiters listen to the specials ?
there &apos;s chilean sea bass with a mango relish
why is nobody writing these ?
we can remember them .
because you &apos;ll make up fake specials and make me cook them ?
sure , that too .
forget the specials for a minute .
here &apos;s the thing ....
for the last two weeks i have ... tried hard to create a positive atmosphere .
can &apos;t hear you !
positive atmosphere .
but i &apos;ve had it up to here .
from now on , it is going to be my way or the highway . all right ?
does anybody have a problem with that ?
hey , new guy .
i said , does anybody have a problem with that ?
no , ma &apos;am .
he has a name . it &apos;s dragon .
you want to know your name ? check your hat .
we did the hat , right ?
what the hell just happened ?
i am so sorry .
i was going to do it .
but i was standing there with $ 327 in one hand ... and $ 238 in the other . and i was thinking .
... it &apos;s been a long time since i had ...
... $ 327 plus $ 238 !
we had a deal ! it &apos;s why you &apos;re here . i &apos;ve got to fire you !
and i got to pay rent !
how about you don &apos;t fire me .
instead , i stay . i gain their trust .
they &apos;ll listen to the nice things i say about you .
what nice things ?
nothing yet . they hate you , and i want to fit in .
happy hannukah , chandler and monica
merry , merry
you know what , pheebs ?
i &apos;m not jewish so ....
ross doesn &apos;t decorate his tree with floss ... but he &apos;s not complaining.do you ?
bad dream ?
i wasn &apos;t sleeping .
what was phoebe &apos;s song about ?
it &apos;s the one with the cat .
i got to go . i &apos;ve got another date .
did you pick one yet ?
it turns out the one from uptown was making a joke .
it was a different joke . it wasn &apos;t that funny .
so i &apos;m still torn .
you don &apos;t like the one from uptown .
and you &apos;re exhausted from dating poughkeepsie .
just end them both !
go to poughkeepsie and break up with her .
then break up with uptown .
by the time you get home , you &apos;re done !
you &apos;re right . thank you .
i had a similar problem when i lived in prague .
prague ?
so much you don &apos;t know .
patrick just ended things with me .
did you or didn &apos;t you tell him i wanted a serious relationship ?
i did ! i absolutely did !
you idiot !
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right . but why ?
you don &apos;t tell a guy that you want a serious relationship .
now you scared him away !
i am sorry . i am so sorry .
you should never be allowed to talk to people !
i know , i know !
now i &apos;m right back where i started .
this sucks !
being alone sucks !
you &apos;ll meet somebody .
you &apos;re a great catch !
when i told those guys about you , i didn &apos;t have to lie once .

you graduated magna cum laude , right ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i got tickets to the ranger game . you want to come with me ?
cute guys in little shorts ?
