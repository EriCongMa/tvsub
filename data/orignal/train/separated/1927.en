"I Must Have Lost It on the Wind"
I looked up my birth mom. Ellis Grey. Did you know her?
I want another baby.
Yang is leaving a seat open.
And I'm recommending you.
She left me her seat.
I was gonna ask you to be by my side
for the rest of our lives.
He's very dreamy. But he is not the sun. You are.
You're asking me to choose between this job...
and my family?
I am staying here.
Owen knows this is the right move for me.
So you can go.
When I was 5,
my mom lost me in a park.
I don't remember much,
except that one minute, I was riding the carousel
And the next...she was gone.
I don't remember how I found her.
I don't remember how I got home.
Are you okay?
All I remember is what happened next.
She told me not to worry.
She told me everything would be fine.
They are saving your mother's life.
Don't put that on me. Stop it!
Don't touch me!
She told me it was time to play the quiet game,
So I knew I wasn't supposed to ask any questions...
Would you like to see her?
No. Absolutely not. No.
...or else, I might have told her...
I forgot my doll.
I loved that doll so much.
It killed me to leave it behind.
Funny, isn't it, the way memory works...
The things you can't quite remember
and the things you can never forget?
You really should get your locks changed.
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to Alex.
Wilson, get out of the bed.
I can't get in the bed with you in there.
You can't kick me out of bed.
It's my house.
No, it's my house.
Then you kick her out.
I'm not wearing any--
I don't care about your boobs, Wilson. Out.
Oh, my God.
I guess I'll go make us some coffee since I'm up.
Coffee would be great.
This is not our thing now, okay?
You can't just start showing up at all hours and --
I mean, this is not what we do.
I told Derek I am not moving to D.C.
The children and I are staying here.
All right, the miracle is over.
The miracle is not over.
We're not a miracle. Shut up.
You can't break into my house and wake me up to talk
and then tell me to shut up!
Okay.
So, here's what happened --
Last night, I found out I have a daughter.
Or at least, I think she's my daughter.
All these years, I...
I had no idea, and now she's here.
She doesn't know who I am,
and I can't talk about it to anyone.
So, I figure I'd wind up one of two places --
Either here... or in a bar, so I...
Anyway...
Here I am.
You're here early.
Yeah, an MVC came in last night after you left.
The driver had an open-book pelvis, so I stuck around.
You've been here all night?
Medevac just called.
Hypotensive patient en route, possible multi-trauma.
All right, page Yang.
Pierce -- page Pierce and Grey
and ask them to meet me at the helipad.
Can you finish up here?
Sure, yeah.
He's dying inside.
He seems fine.
Well, sure. He's a soldier.
He's stuffing everything down, but he needs a buddy.
You could be his buddy.
Nope.
Oh, come on!
How would you feel if I were the one who left?
You lying awake at night in your empty bed...
What kind of buddy are you asking me to be?
Should they be flying in this?!
No choice!
Hi!
What?!
I said, "Hi!"
I'm Maggie! Pierce!
I know!
We haven't officially met!
Hello!
What?!
I said --
Are we safe up here?
Just answered my own question.
Okay, let's get ready. We've got to be quick.
Okay, let's go!
Lost camper, extracted from the desert --
Scablands west of Spokane.
Hikers found him, thought he was dead.
Let's get him out.
Be careful!
Okay.
Grab him, bring him back in!
We cannot unload him until this wind dies down.
Watch out!
What if -- what -- what if she runs off with our baby?
I mean, what if -- what if she does drugs?
What -- what if -- what if she doesn't eat right.
W-what if she forgets her prenatals?
Last night, you were all for a surrogate.
What changed?
No-- nothing.
I just -- I -- I was brushing my teeth this morning,
I saw my scar in the mirror.
I was pregnant with Sofia when that accident happened. Me.
Even I couldn't protect our unborn child.
How can we put that kind of trust in someone we don't even know?
Sofia's fine. You know, it was a freak accident.
There's no reason to think that that's gonna happen --
Excuse me, out of the way, please.
Patient downstairs. We need more hands! Let's move!
Okay.
Get out of my way!
The best cases
go to the fastest resident, and I'm the fastest resident.
I'm caffeinated, and I've been up all night.
No more mister nice girl.
It's every woman for themselves now.
There!
I need a central line and an art line set up stat.
Dibs.
Damn it.
And somebody needs to go help chief Hunt.
The gurney just flew off of the helipad.
Dibs.
Dibs.
You can't double-dibs. That's my dibs.
I can't tell which is better!
One of you, get over here!
Wait! My dibs!
Bitch!
Help!
Over here!
Oh, my God!
Somebody, anyone! Help! Please!
Someone, help! Somebody, please!
Somebody, anyone.
On three. One, two, three.
So, this guy got lost in a desert.
I didn't even realize Washington State had a desert.
I'm from Bosto
Yeah, I heard, um, you lived there, too.
Yeah, my mom moved us there when I was a kid.
Ellis Grey, right? That's your mom?
Yeah.
Oh! No, s-- unh-unh. Sir, don't do that.
H-- don't do that.
Find them. Find them.
His pulse is through the roof.
Edwards, monitor his SATs,
and let's up his sedation.
Have to find them.
Who do you want us to find?
My family.
Please find them. They're still out there.
My family, please.
His B.P. plummeted.
Get him a fluid bolus, and start 10 of dopamine.
His rhythm is erratic. Repeat EKG, stat.
Help us!
Just hang in there. We're gonna get you out of there.
This door's jammed!
It really hurts. Is that normal?
Nothing about this is normal!
Dave, is that you?
I think that's Dave Oldroyd in there.
What, you know him?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Stage 2 osteosarcoma patient.
He's due for his next round of chemo in like an hour.
Dave, what are you doing in there? Are you all right?
My head hurts when I move it.
Don't move your head!
All right, just hang in there, Dave.
Let me get a closer look.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Everything okay?
Yeah -- no.
They're sitting in each others' laps with no pants.
Why aren't you wearing any pants?!
Well, I'll give you one little guess.
Okay, we're gonna need to get them both c-spined.
Who's gonna climb in there?
Not it.
Ooh, bum leg.
Dibs.
I alerted the authorities
that the patient was traveling with family.
Edwards, can you imagine?
He must have been out there wandering around, lost,
looking for his family, day after day, all alone.
Dr. Grey.
Do you want me to page plastics to look at the foot?
Yeah. That thing's nasty.
Oh, god!
Hold on. Foot's gonna have to wait.
He's got perinephric fluid buildup.
We got to get him up to C.T. right now.
Good news! The tech is available,
so I'd like to get that echo done now --
Prep an O.R. And get a new chem 7
because his potassium's been all over the place.
I'd really like to make sure
there isn't any underlying cardiac pathology.
Should I, uh, re-check his coags, or...
Dr. Grey.
What?
The echo. When can I get that?
Oh, that's gonna have to wait. Excuse me.
You guys aren't waiting on the board meeting, are you?
That's been postponed.
Postponed? For how long?
B-because Dr.Webber is recommending me to the board
as the replacement for Yang's vacancy.
He is?
Well, we will address that when we reconvene.
Karev, you need something, too?
Yeah, um, these are Yang's shares of the hospital
along with a certified letter.
She gave her seat to me.
So, you can just hand off board seats to whomever you want?
I mean, what about the members of this hospital?
Don't we have rights? Don't we have a voice?
What are the rules here?
I said I'll talk to legal. It's an unprecedented situation.
It's not a situation. My shares are legit.
I have them in my hand.
And where the hell have you been?
Well, I was --
Tell them, Richard.
Tell them that I belong on the board, not Karev.
Karev?
Yeah, Yang's trying to give Karev her seat. I don't --
No, she did give it.
Um...excuse me.
And what are you...?
I just need to know you won't talk to anyone
about what you heard this morning.
It's anonymous for a reason, Richard.
Of course not.
But if you ever wanted to talk, you could, to me.
I'm a really good listener, and it's not like
I don't have things
that I would rather not have everybody here know.
I mean, I haven't even told my own brother about --
I don't wanna to talk.
The last name is Peterson.
The wind blew my son's frisbee up onto our roof.
My husband climbed up there --
If you could check in at the desk,
I'm sure someone could help you.
Daddy fell and didn't wake up.
I got a page?
All right.
Can you guys wait over there,
and I'll see what I can find out.
Come with me.
Good, you're here.
There's too much blood to do the ventric.
Can you help?
Geez. He belongs to them?
Yep.
Oh, damn it.
B.P.'s 220 over 123. He's bradying down.
The family's asking for an update.
Is there anything I could tell them now?
Well, nothing good.
Just hang tight, okay? We're working to get you out.
Are you calling my mom?
Of course we're calling your mom.
Mrs. Oldroyd?
Hi. This is Dr. Torres.
Are you gonna tell her that we were --
My parents are gonna kill me.
They don't even know I took the car.
Monica, babe, you're hurt.
I'm sure it's fine.
A gurney landed on you, the sunroof shattered on your head.
Dave, can you see anything,
any open wounds?
Oh. Oh -- oh, god.
Door's coming off!
She's got a head wound, bleeding profusely.
All right, let's get her out of there and get her inside!
Be careful.
All right, head first, okay?
Okay, here we go.
Ready? On three. One, two, three.
Uh, can I get a blanket?
Thank you.
Here you go.
Watch out for broken glass.
All right, buddy.
Make sure you're protecting his c-spine.
Easy. Easy.
One, two, three.
Good news is, this day really
can't get any worse, can it?
Don't look! Don't look!
Now's your chance.
What? No, no, no.
Hey, chief, you got a minute?
I've got to go check on my John Doe in C.T., but what's up?
Uh, well, are you busy tonight?
'Cause a couple of guys are probably gonna get together.
You know, uh, hit Joe's, grab some brewskies.
Oh, yeah? Who's going?
So far, there's me, uh, a-and you.
Okay, well, um, I don't know
what time I'm gonna get out of here tonight,
so can I let you know?
Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. Let me know.
See? Was that so hard?
Yes. It was.
What I don't understand is, why a car?
You're in a building full of beds and supply closets.
We haven't seen each other in weeks.
My dad was just transferred to Portland last month.
Yeah, plus, it's kind of hard
to get privacy on a peds floor.
Because it's a place for young children to heal,
not to have sex.
You told her?
Two teenagers in a car?
I did the math.
Your collarbone is broken, Dave,
and your shoulder is really badly bruised.
David Lincoln Oldroyd,
you were supposed to be taking it easy!
You weren't even supposed to be out of bed.
And you definitely weren't supposed to have visitors.
Yeah, well, it's not like I planned
to have a gurney fall on us.
Don't you smart off to me.
Some of these glass shards are embedded pretty deeply.
I may have to shave some of your hair.
Are you kidding?
No!
Yes! Awesome! I -- shave it all!
Rock on!
No!
I've been trying to shave my head in solidarity forever.
It's so dumb.
Why would anyone volunteer to be bald?
No, you're gonna love it.
It's so smooth and so sweet.
You are so getting separate rooms.
Okay, well, the good news is,
everyone's fine, so let's just focus on that, okay?
Yikes, that mom was harsh and judgy and --
No, I totally agree with her.
You do?
You don't?
Robbins, I just stopped by to check on the U.T.O.
I repaired at 21 weeks,
and the parents could not stop singing the praises of you.
Ah, you should have seen the surgery
that Dr. Herman performed on this baby in utero.
It was masterful.
Yes, it was.
But the baby hits the air, you do a few little stitches,
and you get all the credit.
How is that fair?
Oh, by the way, I'm still looking to fill my fellowship,
if you hear of anybody good.
Maybe you should apply.
Yeah, then you could learn to do something that's actually hard.
Well, I actually do really hard things in peds.
Really? Uh, like the teens in the parking lot.
How are they?
Fine.
Oh, they're morons.
When do you leave for D.C., anyway?
I was gonna ask Meredith if I could store some things
in your side of the closet.
Did Meredith tell you that?
You both did, loudly,
until about 4:00 in the morning.
How does it work exactly?
You're not separated, but you're not living together.
Meredith's staying behind?
She is.
And you're cool with that?
You're together but living apart...
Live-a-partners!
See that? I gave it a name. Now it's a thing.
Yeah, I'm familiar with that thing.
I did it with Miranda.
How did it work out for you guys?
Well, seeing as I'm not living in L.A. anymore,
I'd say it didn't.
It's not crazy, right,
to go after this opportunity?
I'm not a bad person for wanting this.
No, but Meredith's not either.
This is her home. It's your kids' home.
You can't blame her for wanting to stay.
How are you gonna get laid when the person
you get laid with is here and you are in D.C.?
Oh, grow up. It's a valid question.
Okay. Removing the skull flap.
This won't take a long.
Dr. Hunt and I will be just over there.
I have to go.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna need you to stay still, okay?
Well, they're still out there.
The authorities are looking for your family,
And they're notify us as soon as --
I can't -- I can't be here. I have to go.
Okay. Uh, how about if I stay with you, right here?
Would you like that, if I just stay here.
I'll stay here with you.
I -- I found footprints,
And th-- they're so tiny that they have to be hers.
It's my little girl, Lily.
She's only 6 years old.
We were trying to find Nine Mile Falls,
and the car died and I was -- I went to go find help.
I told them I would -- I told them I would be right back.
It's Lily and it's my wife,
and I-if if they're separated,
if Lily is by herself right now...
It's already been three days,
and she's not gonna make it without any water.
So, I have to go right now, and we have to hurry.
Please!
You've -- you've been in the desert for more than three days.
I -- I know.
It's maybe -- maybe f-- maybe four days.
Based on your state of dehydration
and your level of malnutrition,
I think it's been more like one or two months.
What?
No.
What?
They're gone, aren't they? My Lily?
My Lily. She's 6.
She's 6 years old.
Oh, my Lily.
Grey, we need to move him now.
Tell them we have a name for his daughter.
Her name is Lily.
And they found him at Saddle Mountain.
That's 100 miles from Nine Mile Falls.
They've been looking for his family in the wrong spot.
Dr.Grey.
I stopped by C.T. to take the patient for his Echo,
but you were gone.
Echo has to wait.
Lily...
His right kidney has severe E.P.N. And abscesses.
We're taking him up to O.R. 3 right now.
Whoa, whoa, sir! Hey. Sir, lay down.
I have to get off!
Lay down, sir, please!
Lay down.
I still need that Echo.
Not now.
You know what's weird?
I keep paging cardio
and expecting Cristina to just walk through the door.
Pierce is no Yang. She's perky and chatty.
I bet she likes cats.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Crossley's anastomosis may be leaking.
Oh, so, you're gonna take him back for a wash out?
We're prepping him in O.R. 1 right now.
Great
Is there something else?
You have... very steady hands.
Thank you.
Uh, have you ever played jenga,
you know, where -- where you stack the little bricks
and try not to make them fall?
Yeah.
You should come over sometime.
I'll make snacks.
Okay.
Or if, uh, you're not into jenga, there's checkers.
Oh, my God!
I -- I can't believe we're actually doing this!
Oh, my parents are gonna freak!
They're gonna freak?
What about me? I'm fully freaking over here.
All right. That's it.
Oh, my God.
Adorable right? We are like alien lovers.
One of the legs needs some stitches.
I'm gonna grab a suture kit.
Okay.
Can you get me some more tape, too, please?
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
Monica?
What's happening? Is she ok?
Dr. Torres!
Oh no.
Why isn't she moving?
Monica!
What's happening?
Monica? Look at me.
What's wrong?
Look at me. Monica?
Page Dr. Shepherd.
Ok
They're calling for an emergency neuro consult downstairs.
17-year-old female, trauma to the head.
I can handle things here. Okay.
Warren, you coming?
Well, actually, would you mind if I stayed here?
No offense, but you've already got one foot out the door,
and this Dr. Shepherd is the new head of neuro.
So, you want to stay here and not come with me?
Why not? Seems to be the trend these days.
The site is prepped and ready.
Okay, let's flush this with collins and heparin
and put this kidney in its new place.
B.P. just dropped out. Is there a pulse?
I don't know.
Okay. Edwards, stay with the kidney while I bring him back.
Let's get a crash cart in here.
Push 1 of epi.
Starting compressions.
C.V.P. is soaring.
Page Pierce, get her in here.
And let's order an echo.
Right away.
Stopping compressions to check rhythm.
Pulseless v tach.
Charge paddles to 150.
Clear!
How bad is it?
It's an epidural bleed.
I cannot believe they snuck out to that car.
If I were her mother and this brain bleed didn't kill her,
I would totally kill her.
Oh, god. Oh, god,
I sound just like my father when I was a teenager.
What is -- what is wrong with me?
I love him, but I don't want our daughter
to have my father for a mother.
I don't know what you just said,
but it's nice to see what our kids have
in so far for them someday or kid.
You sure you don't want to consider surrogate?
Ok, I can't watch this.
I'm gonna go check on the...
Will you tell me when it's, um -- when it's over?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
What happened?
We were about to do the autotransplant on his kidney
when his B.P. dropped out.
I'll take over.
I think he's in cardiogenic shock.
Thank you. I've got this.
He's got a failed mitral valve from endocarditis.
He'll need a balloon pump.
Gown and glove me.
Pack the belly and get a cardiac team in here.
Edwards, prep the right groin.
Edwards is monitoring the kidney.
Edwards, now.
Let's get this O.R. changed out. These need to go.
Dr. Pierce, you realize that I have another surgery to finish
as soon as you're done here.
Quickly, people.
Dr. Pierce, I'm talking to you.
And I am ignoring you.
We've got a patient in cardiac distress,
which could have been avoided
if I had gotten that echo earlier.
I let you overrule me before. That is not gonna happen again.
No matter how important you are around here, Dr. Grey.
I have a duty to help this patient, not kiss your ass.
Dr. Hunt, I could use an assist.
Dr. Edwards, let's make sure
that that kidney is prepped and ready to go.
As soon as she's finished, we'll get back in there.
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
It's -- it's gone. - What's gone?
The basin with the kidney. The kidney is gone.
Well, look for it!
Look on the floor,
look in the hazardous waste bins, look everywhere.
I'm sorry, Dr. Grey. I took my eyes off it for two minutes.
Because Dr. Pierce came in and started ordering you around.
Yes, I was ordering the resident around.
With no knowledge of what she was already doing.
Are you blaming me for your resident's incompetence?
That is ridiculous. - You should have never barged in --
Hey, we have a patient open on the table
who needs our undivided attention.
Both of you, settle down. - She's the one --
She's accusing me of losing a kidney -- - I said settle down!
Oh, I found it!
They dumped it in the basin.
It's been in the sink the whole time.
Let's get it in here and see if we can save it.
Pupil's blown.
He's herniating. Damn it!
Hey, just wanted to get an update on Mr. Peterson for his wife.
Push 100 grams of 20% mannitol!
I.C.P. is still elevated.
More mannitol! His brain injury's too far gone.
We've been trying to salvage things.
How long has he been down?
37 minutes.
I'm gonna call it.
Time of death, 18:32.
Kepner, is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine. It's just...
He was just trying to get his kid's frisbee, you know?
Dr. Shepherd's doing everything he can for Monica,
but it's just...
She seemed so fine, giving me attitude.
Are her parents...?
On a plane now. They should be here soon.
When they're babies, you --
you spend every night by their crib,
just watching them, make sure that they're still breathing.
They start walking,
so you childproof every inch of your house.
They start climbing trees,
and you just pray that they don't fall
and crack their head open.
They turn 16...
...and they get cancer.
And...
just when you're finally about to beat that,
they sneak out to a parking lot to have sex
and a gurney falls out of the sky!
I mean, how are we supposed to do it?
How are we ever supposed to keep them safe?
It's bad news, isn't it?
Hey, we'll be right in.
You should stay in bed, keep that shoulder immobilized.
You guys have been out here a long time.
Is it 'cause she's dead?
You're trying to figure out how to tell me?
No, sweety, Monica is not dead.
Yet. You -- you mean she hasn't died yet.
What am I gonna tell her parents?
How am I gonna explain to them...
...that I'm the reason she --
Oh, whoa, whoa, no.
No one has died, okay?
We are -- we're just gonna sit here,
and we're gonna think good thoughts.
Don't you worry.
It's like the fight's gone out of him.
He's been this way since he woke up from surgery --
Listless, confused.
Well, his pupils are responsive.
Can you follow this light for me?
I just want to sleep.
I know you're tired, but this is an important examination.
You're a doctor?
I am.
Then help me. Give me something.
Put me to sleep.
That's when they come,
when I close my eyes and I go places.
And then they come in the door and everything's --
Everything's fine.
I shouldn't have left them.
I should never have left them.
Leave me alone please.
I just want to sleep.
Karev?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
But, uh, you don't want to go in there.
You had no right to accuse me --
I have every right.
I have never experienced this --
this level of disrespect and this lack of professionalism --
Respect is earned,
and if you want to talk about being unprofessional,
I spoke directly to you and you ignored me in my O.R.
You ignored my request for an echo this morning.
My patient was circling the drain, and I was doing my job.
And I was doing mine.
I spent all morning deferring to you,
trying not to step on your toes, for what?
Because I wanted you to like me?
Well, guess what. I'm kind of over that now.
Yeah, you definitely don't have to worry about me liking you.
It took my last two dollars.
And it won't give me my granola bar!
Hmm. Everything okay?
Meredith Grey.
She's your sister.
Yeah, you figured that out, too.
I was hoping...
I was gonna talk to her today, tell her.
First, I was gonna win her over with my talent and charm,
and then I --
I found my sister, and I think I hate her.
She's terrible.
She's not. She's -- - What am I doing?
I have parents --
Good, funny, kind, goofy parents.
I don't need any -- screw it.
Screw her.
I am just fine without adding any random,
unwanted blood relatives into my life.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
Not necessary.
Think he'll be able to hang on?
Oh, it's hard to predict.
Oh, did you catch the game last night?
What game?
W-wasn't there a game?
I don't know. I just asked you.
All right, screw this.
See, Kepner is worried about you.
She asked me to take you out.
What, like a date?
No, not a date.
It's like a -- a man-date thing but not like a date.
Listen, I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.
You're the one who's not fine.
You're the one who's splitting up with his wife.
I'm not splitting up. I got a job.
On the other side of the country.
Oh, Cristina's on the other side of the world.
She's not my wife.
Sh-she and I split up, whereas you two, you're --
Wait, this is none of your business.
Just stop asking me out on dates!
How's this for solidarity?
You know what? Dave's mom's right.
Even -- even if you play it safe,
You aren't safe, not really,
So we might as well take a few risks, right?
I'm so happy to hear you say that.
You are? - Yeah, 'cause I-I -- well,
I have something to talk to you about.
Me too.
About this morning. Oh!
You were right. I was overreacting.
You know what? We can't control everything.
So we should do it.
Let's get a surrogate and have another baby.
Absolutely.
Oh, no, um, well, actually I was talking about
the, um, fetal surgery fellowship
that Dr. Herman mentioned.
Oh. Oh, okay.
Y-- so, you're, uh, recommending somebody?
I thought maybe... me.
I could get double-certified. It's an incredible opportunity.
So, you're...
essentially going back to school?
It'll be hard, I know --
You know, study sessions and longer hours.
And a new baby.
Right. So, that's why I was just --
that's all. I was just thinking about it.
You guys coming?
What's this about, again?
Yang's board seat.
Oh, that's a no-brainer.
It's Bailey.
Yeah, it's Alex.
So, here is what we know -- Karev has a letter
from Yang's attorney granting him her shares
and her board seat.
So, that's Karev's seat.
Uh, not so fast.
According to the bylaws of the foundation,
new board members are appointed by a majority vote
from other members.
That is the closest thing we have to a rule.
So, what do we do?
I propose we let them fight it out.
Can I talk to you after this?
Dr. Grey?
There's news about the hiker's family.
I did.
Hi. Thank you.
Yang gave me her shares for a reason.
I know you don't think I deserve the seat,
but I don't want to screw it up, I'm not gonna screw it up.
I'm sure you'd make an excellent board member.
Hey, may the best surgeon win.
That was nice of you.
Yes, it was.
You think he's got a shot?
Please. It's Alex Karev.
How is Mr. Peterson?
On my way to talk to his family now.
It's gonna be super fun.
I love telling little kids that dad is never coming home.
I'll go with you.
Actually, I'd appreciate that.
Yeah, somebody should be there
to make sure you don't say things like "Super fun."
Ah. Good note.
Hey, Luca. What a cool spaceship.
Where's your mom?
Dr. Shepherd?
Luca, we just need to talk to your mom over here for sec.
You cool to hang out, work on that spaceship?
No.
Oh, no.
What happened?
Mom?
I'll stay with him.
Come on with me.
Come on. This way, Luca.
I want to go with my mom.
I haven't seen a spaceship with a trap door before.
Want to show me how to use it?
My dad's dead, isn't he?
Well, we should talk about that when your mom's back.
Dead means he's gone away, doesn't it,
and he's never coming back?
It does.
I miss him already.
The nurses say you're refusing your I.V. fluids.
You need them to get your strength back.
There is a reason you survived for so long.
I don't believe this has to be the end for you.
Finally...
I'm asleep.
They're always here when I'm asleep.
Papa?
Papa!
They found us the next day, but they never found you.
We thought you were gone.
You were gone.
I love you, papa.
There can be beauty in getting lost.
There you are.
Grab your stuff. We're drinking.
Oh, I -- I can't.
I have to go home and deal with --
Fight with Shepherd?
I think you need to whine about it some more to me first.
You definitely need to drink.
What are you afraid of, that I'm gonna --
I'm afraid you're gonna keep crawling in my bed
in the middle of the night.
Look, Yang left me her shares and her board seat
and...she left me you, too.
It's just us now.
I don't know if you need somebody to bitch to or just be...
My person.
I don't know what you mean.
But you do.
Sometimes, we have to get lost to find each other.
I just don't know if my marriage can survive this.
My mom asked me to give this to you.
Oh, I see.
How did she seem?
Not great.
Though, I guess the idea of becoming a grandma
is helping distract her, at least.
That's right. Congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
I'm a little freaked out, to be honest.
I didn't grow up with much of a dad,
so kind of working in the dark here.
Oh, you'll be fine, Avery.
More than fine.
Thank you for returning this.
Yeah. Sure.
For what it's worth, sir...
...it would have been really nice having you in the family.
And sometimes, we find each other,
only to get lost all over again.
I'm a widow. She widowed me.
I'll never have Alex to myself again.
Her best friend just left yesterday, okay?
She needs someone to talk to. You are overreacting.
She kicked me out of my own bed in the middle of the night,
while I was naked, and he let her.
Okay. So, you're screwed.
You can't always control it,
the thing that's going to set you adrift...
I mean, people do it, right?
It's not conventional, it's not easy, but people do it.
I mean, if we can map brains, we can figure this out.
Are you trying to convince me or you?
I mean, I don't want to split up our family, either,
but I certainly don't want to go
and then resent him for the rest of my life.
And that's what would happen.
And he doesn't want that, either, so I -- I --
I really just -- I need to go talk to him about this. I --
Yeah, well.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I just got off the phone with the White House.
I resigned from the brain mapping initiative.
What?
I'm not moving to D.C.
Why would you do that?
Well, I don't want to live anywhere else
when my kids are growing up here.
I don't want to be apart from them, or you.
No job is worth that to me.
I want to be with you and the kids here.
No.
What?
This is not what we discussed.
I mean, you should call them back
and tell them you were kidding.
I got to pee.
I did not ask you to do this. I never wanted you --
I know you didn't. I chose.
I chose you and the kids.
...and as you stand there on your front porch,
staring at the life you're about to leave behind...
I need a drink.
...you have to accept it's gone,
it's lost, just like you.
All you can do now is stand very still...
...breathe in the moment, and try to be open
to wherever the wind's going to take you next.
Tequila.
Tequila.
