i think , you over @-@ privileged kids
with your electronic tablets
and your talking phones ,
wouldn &apos;t know a good piece of fiction
if your ipod read it to your ass .
i wish someone would have come from the future ,

comic @-@ tolerating girlfriend , strawberry .
now when milo talks to himself , it won &apos;t seem crazy .
so , milo talks to himself .
we will treasure that information .

the only thing that could make this moment more cliched ,
is if i started to sing about my feelings .
and ... here i go .
* i &apos;ve always been happy *
* to call myself single *
玛丽 · 简跟章鱼博士结婚了 我却是摄影师
* no mary jane *
我一会儿还可以消除她的记忆

stan lee !
or , is it my imagination ?
i &apos;m your imagination .
the real stan lee &apos;s over there .
excelsior !
but listen ,
as comic book guys go ,
you &apos;re trim , friendly , and ,
quite a catch .
but now ... your opportunity is knocking .
don &apos;t let it slip by .
can you help me ?
i can only watch .
i cannot interfere .
new radioactive man number one , please .
come on , nudnik . ask her out .
you &apos;re interfering .
hey , i &apos;m 90 years old .
i can do what i want .
um ... er ... stammer . eh ...
c @-@ can i sign you up for our frequent buyer &apos;s club ?
the just us league ?
you would be member number 003 .
i-- i am the first two .
sure .
i am kumiko nakamura from osaka .
i am visiting america &apos;s saddest cities ,
as research for my autobiographical manga .
volume six , springfield .
land of angry tears .
that &apos;s you .
the man with sparkling eyes , and zigzag beard .
you have seen me before ?
yes . through window .
but you don &apos;t see me .
you &apos;re either looking down in disgust , or up in disdain .
i think you have great soul .
would you permit me to go in the back , and do a brief inventory ?
she tolerates me !
ah ... is it too soon to give you flowers in a hulk hand ?
it is the perfect time .
bart !
your comic vendor &apos;s here .
uh , actually , it is you that i am here to see .
i , um , i need your help .
i am getting ready for a date .
the closest thing i have to a father
is the obi @-@ wan doll in my store .
and he comes from a race of celibate knights .
so ...
i will help you . as long as our bellies never touch again
like they are right now .
why pick me ?
because you are the only fat man in real life
who ever got a hot woman .
well , come in .
i &apos;ll explain how it all works .
okay . it helps if she &apos;s got a mother
she &apos;s trying to get back at .
no woman will be able to resist you , dressed like this .
now , remember ,
don &apos;t be the way you normally are
and sustain that for the rest of your life .
kumiko , uh , meet my dear friends .
uh , homer and marge simpson .
i @-@ in my country , it is a tradition to bring a much older couple
on a first date .
it is not in any way , weird ,
or @-@ or sad .
does anyone tell you that you look like the man
on a box of mr. sparkle ?
in japan , drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide .
honki da yo ? !
美式饮食休闲
kumiko , for you ,
we chose the coolest restaurant in town .
but the walls are covered with garbage .
not garbage , americana .
here &apos;s some more americana , that bubbled up in the swamp .
here you go : your all @-@ american
fifty state potato skin sampler .
wisconsin , cheddar .
maryland , blue crab .
they &apos;re neither in alphabetical , nor geographical order .
what @-@ what madness is this ?
please , sir .
ask your questions after all 50 &quot; tates . &quot;
i cannot hide the snide inside .
oh . i don &apos;t mind .
if you think it &apos;s stupid ,
say it &apos;s stupid .
really ?
in japan , no one ever says what they think .
we know our game shows are degrading
and our baseball fences are too close .
but no one says anything .
attention , restaurateurs !
you should &apos;ve spent less on the kitsch ,
and more on the kitch @-@ en .
with this bowl of chuck &apos;s cherokee salsa ,
i baptize you mediocre , at best .
american nerd snark is the finest in the world .
let &apos;s go walking and mocking in the rain .
i &apos;m in love !
and , yet , still a little bitter .
it &apos;s surprising .
爱情蒙太奇
《 吉姆 · 贾姆 · 邦克斯的刑罚 》
father , why @-@ sa you @-@ sa forsake @-@ a me @-@ sa ?
marge , homer , you have nurtured our love
like steven speilberg nurtured the careers of zemeckis and gale .
so , we want you to know ,
i have decided to move in
to the basement under his store .
at last , we &apos;ll be in the same bed .
just like batman and robin .
homer , i want you to take kumiko
and comic book guy a housewarming present ,
and maybe check in on them ?
we talked about this , marge .
the hammock is a chore @-@ free zone .
apparently , including tying the knots on the hammock .
and getting the termites out of the trees .
not a word .
excuse me , sir .
i am looking for my daughter .
i thought this was her residence ,
but all i see is a store full of , uh ,
non @-@ pornographic manga .
you &apos;re kumiko &apos;s father ?
welcome , sensei .
i am not a kung fu instructor .
i am a humble salary man who could kick your ass .
say , has anyone told you
you look like--
i know . mr. sparkle .
i was going to say ,
like you &apos;re going to have a stroke .
i get that a lot too .
now , please , where is my daughter ?
okay . she moved in with her boyfriend .
well , he &apos;s not a boy .
he &apos;s immature .
but , fat and old .
so , an obese nerd has stolen my daughter
to live in his basement ?
i didn &apos;t tell you about the basement .
it was an obvious guess !
daughter !
you are coming back to japan !
there are 87 old people
who need you to take care of them .
no . please ... please . i was becoming cuddly .
i deleted rants from my blog .
you can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash .
goodbye !
now i know i &apos;ve got a heart ...
because it &apos;s breaking .
wizard of oz reference !
did i do that ?
urkle reference !
help me .
fire reference !
i can &apos;t stop .
i can &apos;t stop .
homer simpson , this was your doing .
and i want you to fix it .
i have a bad feeling about this !
every action movie ever made reference !
now !
yeah , homer .
we have much in common .
we both love our daughters ,
and discipline our sons .
no ... discipline would imply ,
i &apos;m trying to make him better .
so ... are you married ?
my dear michiko has passed away .
but she &apos;s always with me .
you promise double suicide .
you hear what you want to hear .
always with me .
another drink !
something stronger !
snake rice wine .
now , that &apos;s disgusting .
wine made of rice ?
try some .
hai .
why didn &apos;t i stop with the snake wine ?
why did i drink the fish wine ?
that was the aquarium .
you didn &apos;t see nothin &apos; . scram .
uh ! i am ruined by whimsy .
the good thing is ,
soon i &apos;ll be a beautiful swan .
what &apos;s going on here ?
we &apos;ll explain it .
the rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls .
yeah , listen to my tail .
you &apos;re the tail !
no ... you &apos;re the tail .
dad ! bart &apos;s feet are on my half of the shell !
why , you slimey little--
hey , that actually feels good .
oh , yeah . more .
a little bit more .
right there . oh , yeah .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s the stuff .
enough nonsense !
i came here for my daughter !
* i @-@ i am a golden bird *
* and i love the comic nerd *
* of this , i won &apos;t be cured *
* papa @-@ san , papa @-@ san *
the monster is me .
who ... &apos; da thunk it ?
homer , drinking that snake wine ,
and going to white castle afterwards ,
really opened my eyes .
mr. nakamura ,
i have used my hitherto unmentioned
chemical engineering degree to get a real job
at the springfield phosphate works .
they &apos;re giant polluters .
but ... the ceo is a woman .
it &apos;s very vexing .
now , have i proven myself worthy of your daughter ?
no .
please , take your time .
you were worthy !
the way you were .
i-- i was ?
but i rented the store .
i ebayed my stool .
cancel the sale .
but then my seller rating will go down ...
stop being nerd !
yes , papa @-@ san .
geekly beloved ,
we are gathered here in the eyes of me ,
king of the cameos ,
stan lee .
to celebrate the wedding of , comic book guy ,
and kumiko nakamura .
does anyone wish to offer any thoughts ,
on this blessed occasion ?
yes .
i @-@ i @-@ i would like to say something .
um , since i met kumiko ,
strangely , comic books
no longer seem so important .
i will also be selling greeting cards .
and , every day , i will give one to kumiko
in commemoration of today ,
with the salutation ,
&quot; best ... day ... ever . &quot;
ghost wife ,
are you happy ?
