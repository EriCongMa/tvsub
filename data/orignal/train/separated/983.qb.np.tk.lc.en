desperate housewives s07 e11
will you do me the honor of moving in with me ?
proposals were made .
i think starting an interior design business is ...
it &apos;s genius .
juanita learned the truth .
you &apos;re not my mommy .
she told me about this guy that she had a fling with .
susan revealed she knew a secret .
his name was tom scavo .
that was none of your damn business .
i am lynette &apos;s friend , and i &apos;m not gonna stand by
and watch you screw up her marriage .
help !
and when a neighborhood protest got violent ...
juanita ! get off the car !
juanita was saved ...
susan was hurt ...
and later , someone ...
got revenge .
something happened in the suburbs last night .
a man was shot outside his home .
detectives were called to investigate .
and they soon learned this man had enemies .
detectives , i &apos;m an expert marksman .
if i &apos;d been aiming for paul young ,
he &apos;d be dead .
i have no idea who shot paul .
all i know is i need a chiropractor
for all the cartwheels i &apos;ve been doing .
if you find out who did it , let me know .
i want to send them flowers .
yes , the police had many suspects
in the shooting of paul young .
but his wife ...
had only one .
i was surprised you wanted to see me .
our last visit ended less than ... pleasantly .
are you here to apologize ?
you know exactly why i &apos;m here .
no , i don &apos;t .
obviously , you didn &apos;t do it yourself .
so who did you hire ?
beth , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
paul &apos;s been shot .
what ?
is he dead ?
no .
sorry . he &apos;s in the hospital .
when did this happen ?
oh , stop it , mama .
just stop it . i know you had something to do with this .
beth , you have to believe me .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know anything about it .
you &apos;re a liar .
look , i &apos;m not going to pretend i don &apos;t hate the man .
i do .
but my goal all along has been to prove
that he murdered my sister .
why would i have him killed before i could do that ?
then who shot him ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
i have to go to the hospital .
word on the yard is that you can get me
a clean cell phone .
for a price .
get it .
somebody &apos;s been a naughty boy .
i guess you changed your mind about that proposal i made .
oh , don &apos;t get me wrong . i &apos;m thrilled .
i just wish you &apos;d waited till i gave you the signal .
yes , paul young had enemies .
i can &apos;t talk right now .
more than he knew .
it &apos;s something we need to be reminded of
whenever our world has been turned upside down .
come the morning , life goes on .
we pull ourselves together and go on shopping sprees ...
or reignite a love affair ...
or go back to work .
yes , we must remember life will get better ...
unless it doesn &apos;t .
you took out my kidney ?
it had ruptured .
you were bleeding internally . we had no choice .
oh , my god .
but you can get by on one kidney , right ?
usually . but in your case ,
it &apos;s a little more complicated .
the other one is deformed .
well , fine . i won &apos;t enter it in any
kidney beauty contests .
the point is , it &apos;s only operating at about 5 % .
if that number drops any lower ,
you &apos;re at serious risk of renal failure .
how do i not know this ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve never had any serious health problems .
that &apos;s because the other kidney was doing such a great job
of taking up the slack .
you mean the one you took ?
yes .
so what are you saying ? do i need a transplant ?
eventuly . but we need to get you on dialysis .
that requires a minor surgical procedure
to install an a.v. shunt , going--
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down .
y @-@ you said if it goes any lower .
maybe it won &apos;t . maybe it &apos;ll go up .
anything is possible .
but you need to come to terms
with the reality of what &apos;s happened to you .
your life has changed .
i have some information here on dialysis .
i suggest you read it ...
today .
welcome to miss charlotte &apos;s doll academy .
i &apos;m miss charlotte .
how can i serve you today ?
we are here to buy a doll .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . we don &apos;t sell dolls here .
really ?
wow . this place got creepy fast .
but i do let good little girls adopt some of my friends .
are you ready to be a mommy ?
i don &apos;t care .
oh , she &apos;s kidding .
she would love a doll ,
and i want to do something special for her birthday .
so let &apos;s get this adoption going .
very good . i have someone in our royalty cabinet
i &apos;d love for you to meet .
look , i am sorry about everything you &apos;ve been through the past few days .
but i &apos;m trying to show you how much i love you .
can &apos;t you meet me halfway ?
this is lady catherine .
she &apos;s the toast of buckingham palace .
the trim on her cloak is real ermine .
ooh ! isn &apos;t she gorgeous ?
i &apos;ll go prepare her papers .
are you happy , sweetie ?
yeah !
oh . let me get my phone out
so i can take a picture of my two princesses .
why are you looking at grace ?
o @-@ oh , i wasn &apos;t . i was , uh ... i must have scrolled too far .
why do you even have that picture ?
and what name shall i put under &quot; mother &quot; ?
put whatever you want . i hate this stupid place .
oh--juanita !
juanita , wait !
susan , hi .
i heard about your kidney .
and i just want you to know i have two .
so let &apos;s talk deal .
relax . i &apos;m not telling lynette .
you &apos;re not ?
think about having something like this happen to you--
you start to think about what &apos;s important and what &apos;s not .
and i realized it &apos;s not up to me
to tell lynette about something that happened 20 years ago .
oh . thank god .
it &apos;s up to you .
hey . y @-@ you okay ?
you &apos;ve been standing out here for , like , 20 minutes .
i saw susan at the hospital .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s not gonna tell lynette
about our 20 @-@ year @-@ old mistake .
oh , thank god .
what a relief !
w @-@ why aren &apos;t you relieved ?
there &apos;s one thing she said i can &apos;t get out of my head .
if i never tell lynette what happened ,
then my friendship with her is not real .
sure it &apos;s real . ugh .
all my life , people i thought were my friends have left me .
people from college , friends i had with doug--
they &apos;re all gone .
and lynette stayed .
i think i owe her the truth .
no . no , no , no , no , no !
sometimes being a friend requires you to lie .
i mean , come on .
we &apos;ve all seen mccluskey in those jogging shorts
and yelled , &quot; lookin &apos; good ! &quot; that &apos;s being a friend .
renee ...
you can &apos;t tell lynette .
she would be devastated .
i know .
i just have to live with what that says about me .
great . we got a plan .
thought you might want a cold root beer to cool you down .
i like the &quot; cold &quot; and &quot; beer &quot; part .
i know living with a woman who doesn &apos;t drink--
it must be torture .
how &apos;s the replanting coming ?
it &apos;s taking a little while .
yard got pretty messed up by the riot .
i &apos;ll work on the sprinklers later .
there &apos;s no rush .
ah , look who &apos;s drinking out of the bottle .
see what you &apos;ve done to me ?
the next thing you know , i &apos;ll be flossing only once a day .
hey . you started unpacking my stuff ?
yes . your , uh , books are on the shelf .
sports trophies are in the den .
and on a sad note , your beanbag chair accidentally ripped
when i stuck a knife in it
and stuffed it in the trash .
hmm . my lava lamp ?
accidentally broke when i pushed it off the counter .
man , my stuff is clumsy .
i may not love all your things ,
but i love that you &apos;re here .
everything that happened over the last few days
made me realize how important you are to me .
steer manure &apos;s not your favorite aphrodisiac ?
it &apos;s only slightly worse than your aftershave ,
which accidentally got poured down the drain .
well , hold your breath . i &apos;m kissing you anyway .
there is a god .
mm . can i help you ?
someone to see you .
orson .
judy kicked me out .
can i stay here with you ?
i never saw it coming .
one minute , judy and i were enjoying a nice pinot noir ,
and the next , she was wheeling me to the cab ,
and telling me it was over .
that &apos;s terrible .
well , don &apos;t you worry . you can stay here with us .
are you sure ?
i mean , i had no idea that keith had just moved in with you .
i mean , you &apos;re a new couple .
the last thing you need around here
is a third and ... fourth wheel .
nonsense . we insist .
stay as long as you want .
isn &apos;t that right , keith ?
oh , yeah . sure .
any idea how long that might ... be ?
i just want to know how long we &apos;ll be enjoying his company .
i gather as soon as i can find a new place to live
and a caregiver .
would you mind backing up a bit ?
your cologne is making my eyes water .
actually , it &apos;s steer manure .
to each his own .
uh , keith , why don &apos;t you go shower ?
and i &apos;ll , uh , get orson settled .
would you like some tea ?
mm , no . i &apos;m fine .
so ...
keith .
interesting choice .
just ... sort of happened .
hmm .
but moving in together ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you taking this rebound relationship
a little too seriously ?
it &apos;s not a rebound relationship .
what keith and i have is very ... special .
and i know what you &apos;re thinking . he is a bit young .
oh , no . not at all .
i notice he has all of his big boy teeth .
but he and i have a lot in common .
really ?
hmm .
i &apos;m just ... curious .
which lil wayne song is your favorite ?
&quot; fo sheezy &quot; or &quot; ask them hoes &quot; ?
joke if you must ,
but i am not the woman you once knew .
i have changed , and keith is responsible .
what i &apos;m wondering is why would someone change
something that was already perfect ?
god , i never thought
we &apos;d have a kid in therapy .
well , i did . i just thought it &apos;d be celia .
i wish we weren &apos;t doing this .
you know the shrink always blames the mother .
the husband blames the mother , too .
how many times do i have to say i &apos;m sorry ?
you know what ? it is not about us anymore .
juanita &apos;s world is collapsing around her ,
and the only thing that i care about is healing the damage
that &apos;s been done to that poor little girl .
i took her doll shopping .
juanita , if you &apos;d like to go through the magazines ,
i &apos;ll talk to your mom and dad for a minute .
okay .
okay ? please .
obviously , this is a very ... unusual situation .
juanita understands now
that her birth parents are hector and carmen .
but she feels nothing for them .
and because of that , she doesn &apos;t understand
why you feel so much for grace .
well , it &apos;s a different kind of love .
it doesn &apos;t mean we love juanita any less .
what should we do ?
remove grace from your life .
we told you . she &apos;s already gone .
juanita says there are photos of her .
her artwork is on your refrigerator .
you &apos;re saying get rid of all that .
yes . once juanita feels she is again
the most important thing in your life ,
she will start to heal .
well , obviously , i want to help my daughter .
but all the photos ?
we &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
good .
so we canvassed your neighborhood
to determine if anyone had any motive .
and , uh ...
they all did .
yes . but so far ,
all of them have an alibi .
so ... what &apos;s the next step ?
well , we &apos;d like to ask mrs. young a few questions .
what kind of questions ?
well , for starters , we &apos;d like to know
where exactly you were
when your husband was shot , and--
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
my wife is not a suspect in this investigation .
she is the one person in that whole corrupt ,
back @-@ stabbing street that i can trust .
okay . uh ...
is there anyone else who might harbor a grudge against you
or wish you harm in any way ?
not that i can think of .
what about you , mrs. young ?
no .
no one i can think of .
well , then , uh , if you can think of anyone ,
please let us know .
did you catch the look on the wife &apos;s face ?
yeah .
gaby !
what ?
what are these photos of grace still doing here ?
oh . right . sorry .
you should have gotten rid of these
the second we got back from the doctor &apos;s .
i &apos;ve been busy . here , give them to me .
what are you gonna do with them ?
hide them in the closet .
no . we have to throw these away .
why ?
juanita could find them .
she and celia play in your closet all the time .
fine . i &apos;ll put them in our safety deposit box .
the girls don &apos;t play at the bank .
why are you not taking this seriously ?
dr. lunt never said
we had to throw grace &apos;s photos in the trash .
the doctor said we have to remove grace from our lives .
you understand what that means ? as far as we are concerned ,
grace no longer exists . now give me your phone , please .
why ?
i &apos;m going to delete every photo of grace .
oh , you can &apos;t be serious .
juanita is in pain !
do you not get that ? !
she is no longer a happy little girl
because you did not protect her !
so what am i supposed to do ?
just pretend grace doesn &apos;t exist ?
yes ! and that is the last time
you will mention her name in this house !
oh , please , no more meds .
i &apos;m good for what ails ya .
mike ! oh !
oh ...
oh ! oh !
oh , i need to look at you .
no , i need to hug you .
how &apos;s my girl ? hmm ?
hear you &apos;re about a half @-@ pound lighter .
they told you about the kidney ?
yeah . but it &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
dialysis is not as bad as it sounds .
i &apos;m not doing dialysis .
what ?
it &apos;s like six hours a day , four times a week .
there &apos;s not enough gossip rags in the world
to fill up that kind of time .
plus , i have a job and a kid to raise .
but the doctor said--
mike , you know what ?
the doctors-- they don &apos;t know everything .
look at this . there &apos;s herbal remedies and alternative diets .
there &apos;s a lot of other ways to handle this
than being hooked up to a machine .
mike , i @-@ i feel great .
and i just want to handle this my own way .
well , i &apos;d feel a lot better
if you &apos;d listen to the doctors .
and i &apos;d feel a lot better if i had your support .
okay .
god , i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re back .
so the overall approach is craftsman ,
but with japanese accents , including the lighting ....
the vases , the calligraphy . the two styles ...
work perfectly together .
and for your hotel , we think it would look ...
just gorgeous .
well , i usually run everything past my board ...
but not this time .
i love it .
and i love the way you two are so in sync .
well , we should be . we &apos;ve been best friends for 25 years .
well , actually , uh , 26 .
oh.you can tell .
so , let &apos;s see what you have in mind for the lighting .
you guys keep talking . i &apos;m gonna go get the water pitcher ,
&apos;cause the waiter won &apos;t refill my glass .
so ... the lighting .
uh , yeah , i have a company
that does these japanese paper lanterns .
mm . they &apos;re beautiful .
and you know we have other hotels .
so we may need some more conversations .
hey . look what i found next to the water pitcher .
tee ... ta @-@ da !
oatmeal raisin .
she &apos;s always been crazy about them .
remember freshman year , when you broke up with that boyfriend ?
i kept her on a steady diet of these and tequila
for two weeks .
the bar is one of my favorite areas .
those lanterns with these--
are you okay ?
it &apos;s just , uh ...
oatmeal raisin .
yeah ?
you &apos;ve been such a good friend to me .
hey ...
hey , relax !
there was , like , a hundred of &apos; em on a tray .
so , take the drawings home .
live with them . and we will check in next week .
renee , are you ...
yeah , no , she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s fine .
and we &apos;ll call you next week .
and thank you so much . we are so excited .
what the hell ?
i have to tell you something .
20 years ago ...
i did something awful .
god , who cares ?
ten minutes ago , you did something amazing .
i slept with tom .
when ?
it was that weekend you went to visit your parents .
and it was just the one time , and it meant nothing .
and i &apos;ve been carrying this around
ever since i moved here .
and it &apos;s been eating me up .
that was after we were engaged .
yeah , but you had ... broken up ...
for the week .
god , i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
in fact , i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
i can &apos;t even ...
be in the same room as you right now .
but you are my ride , so let &apos;s go .
do you hate me ?
shut up .
lynette , i just need to--
shut up .
yes .
i hate you ...
a lot .
but i do foresee a day far in the future
when i might only hate you a little .
you know what the worst part is ? for the last 20 years ,
you two have been walking around knowing this , and ...
i ...
didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
you &apos;re not , you &apos;re not . and i am so sorry--
oh , my god , you really need to stop saying that .
but i do need you to do me a favor .
anything .
don &apos;t tell tom we talked about this .
why ?
you slept with my husband .
can we just leave it at &quot; &apos; cause i said so &quot; ?
* happy birthday to you *
* happy birthday to you *
* happy birthday , dear juanita *
* happy birthday to you *
hi . we haven &apos;t met yet . i &apos;m tina &apos;s mother .
juanita came to our house last week .
oh , right . thanks for coming .
of course .
mom .
i know . you want some cake .
hold on . we &apos;ll get you some .
sorry . that &apos;s my youngest , celia .
oh , she &apos;s adorable .
do you have any other children ?
no .
i don &apos;t have any other children .
i am finally home .
and just so you know , i had the worst day ever .
did you ?
yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i had to meet with one surly client after another .
our computers went down . i spilled coffee on my shoe .
sounds like you went through a lot .
but i &apos;m much better now .
oh , m--oh , oh , oh , god !
uh , i forgot to ask-- how did the pitch go ?
good . we got the job .
that is fantastic !
oh , my god . you guys are just getting started ,
and you &apos;re already kicking ass ! i am so proud of you !
well , it was mostly renee .
she did the lion &apos;s share of the work .
she &apos;s an amazing woman .
yeah .
everything okay ?
yes , of course . i , um ...
i make some hot chocolate for the kids .
would you like some ?
that sounds great .
yeah ? might be a little cold . do you want me to heat it up ?
no . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s boiling !
is it ?
i @-@ i @-@ i burned my tongue !
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
here we are .
oh , bree , you didn &apos;t . coq au vin ?
well , i know it &apos;s your favorite ,
and considering the rough few days you &apos;ve had ...
you are amazing .
hello .
oh , good , you &apos;re here .
we can eat .
what that ? i thought , uh , we were having sloppy joes .
oh ... uh , well ... since we &apos;re having a guest ,
i thought i &apos;d serve something more elegant .
you know what ? tomorrow night , you and i should make our bouillabaisse .
of course . oh , keith , you &apos;ll love it .
if it &apos;s french for &quot; sloppy joes , &quot; then have at it .
bree , this looks wonderful .
if i may .
&quot; show me another pleasure like dinner
which comes every day and lasts an hour . &quot;
talleyrand .
&quot; shut up and eat , varmints ! &quot;
yosemite sam .
well , this is quite a thrill .
i didn &apos;t know stanley kowalski was joining us for dinner .
is he a friend of you guys ?
um , actually , um ...
it &apos;s a character in &quot; a streetcar named desire . &quot;
he wore a lot of t @-@ shirts and ...
you probably haven &apos;t heard of it .
because will ferrell hasn &apos;t done a remake .
sweetheart , why don &apos;t you go up and put a shirt on ?
after all , it is dinner , and we do have company .
if it &apos;s all the same to everyone , i &apos;m comfortable ,
so i &apos;d like to stay in this .
why don &apos;t i just go up and grab you one ?
it will only take a sec .
bree , sit .
please . i &apos;m sure our company can endure one night of bare arms .
quite right . though i don &apos;t know what the fuss is .
seems like such a reasonable request .
guess i just like dressing the way i want to dress
in my own home . here &apos;s an idea .
why don &apos;t you take off your jacket ,
see how much more comfortable it is ?
well , if it &apos;s all the same to you , i &apos;d prefer not to .
aren &apos;t you afraid of getting food on it ?
not really .
i &apos;m planning on eating with utensils , not my hands .
keith .
whoops .
accidents happen .
well , i suppose i should be happy
it wasn &apos;t his own feces .
orson , i &apos;m so sorry . keith , what were you thinking ?
let &apos;s just put this behind us , shall we ?
and enjoy the lovely meal that you &apos;ve prepared .
oh , and please pass the peas .
stop it this instant ! you &apos;re acting like children ,
and i will not stand for it ! do you hear me ? !
bree .
hi , judy . i &apos;m sorry to just come over here without calling ,
but i need to speak with you .
come in .
how &apos;s orson ?
you know he &apos;s , um , staying with me ?
figured as much .
well , i need a favor .
it &apos;s , uh , just too difficult
for orson to live with me and my new boyfriend ,
and i know you broke up with him , but ...
is there any way he could stay here until he finds a new place ?
look , i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s been telling you ,
but orson left me .
what ? why ?
because he &apos;s still in love with you .
beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s just perfect .
i &apos;ll take her .
i must say , your daughter &apos;s a lucky little girl .
my daughter ?
i assumed you were buying her a present .
oh , no .
this is for me .
i &apos;m really sorry about last night .
but there is something about your ex ...
keith ... - i get it . you had a relationship ,
it &apos;s over , it &apos;s totally platonic ,
and i &apos;m cool with it .
actually , i just spoke with his ex @-@ girlfriend .
orson is still in love with me .
i knew it . i knew it .
let &apos;s wheel his ass to the curb right now .
keith , keith , calm down . before we wheel his ...
anywhere , i need to talk to him .
i &apos;m sure i can get him to make other arrangements .
well , get him to make &apos; em now .
i don &apos;t want that guy in our home another night .
fine . just give me 15 minutes .
i spoke with judy .
she told me that you were the one who left ...
because you still have feelings for me .
is that true ? is that ... why you &apos;re here ?
leaving you was the biggest mistake i could have made .
i know that now .
orson ...
tell me you don &apos;t feel the same way .
just tell me you feel nothing , and i will go away . i promise .
do you know how easy it would be for me to ...
become that woman again ?
to slide back into the role of your wife ?
then do it .
we have a connection , bree , and you know it .
we used to .
but i &apos;ve made a new connection .
please , with that tattooed neanderthal ?
yes , and i will always have feelings for you ,
but i &apos;ve ... changed .
how have you changed ?
i ... i can &apos;t articulate it to you
because i don &apos;t understand it myself .
all i know is that being with keith
has made me a different person .
i don &apos;t believe it .
orson ...
you will always have a piece of my heart ,
but you have to understand that this is over .
i &apos;m not giving up .
i &apos;m not .
so ?
did you tell him ?
does he need help packing his stuff ?
um ... actually , orson &apos;s gonna be staying with us a little longer .
what ?
just , um , for a few more days
until he finds a place of his own .
please ? he &apos;s very fragile right now .
i don &apos;t believe this .
well , i can &apos;t just throw him out .
you know why ? because you don &apos;t want to .
i don &apos;t blame you .
it &apos;s not your fault you &apos;re still in love with him .
what ? !
wait ! please stop and talk to me !
bree , there &apos;s nothing to talk about !
why would you wanna be with sloppy joe
when you can be with coq au vin in there ?
let &apos;s just cut our losses .
you listen to me .
that &apos;s who i was , not who i am now .
i have never worked harder in my life to keep a relationship ,
and if i have to in a pile of steer manure to prove it to you ,
then i &apos;ll do it !
mike , just hang up .
i don &apos;t wanna deal with any more doctors .
he &apos;s a top kidney specialist .
i really want you to talk to him .
i can &apos;t get any reception in here .
i &apos;m gonna go downstairs . m.j. , take care of your mom .
mom , this pudding &apos;s gross .
i wish they had ice cream .
well , i think they do in the cafeteria downstairs .
when your dad comes back , maybe he can take you .
how much longer are you gonna be in the hospital ?
i don &apos;t know . a little longer .
is a kidney like a heart ? do you need it to live ?
uh , well ... yes .
so ... you could die ?
you know what ?
why don &apos;t you and i go downstairs
right now and get you some ice cream ?
mrs. delfino , you &apos;re in no condition
to be getting out of bed .
just taking him for ice cream .
let me at least call you an orderly
and get you a wheelchair .
i don &apos;t need a wheelchair .
look , i need to do this . he &apos;s scared .
so how long till you &apos;re able to play basketball with me ?
oh , not too long . trust me , sweetie .
i can &apos;t wait to kick your butt
in a little game of one @-@ on @-@ one .
are you okay ?
sure .
so , what--what kind of ice cream do you want , sweetie ?
can i have an ice cream sandwich ?
oh . you bet .
you know what &apos;s cool ?
when i was at my friend jerry &apos;s birthday party ,
we made our own ice cream
and put graham crackers in it .
that sounds ... great .
oh . you know what else was cool ? on st. patrick &apos;s day at school ,
they gave us green ice cream .
there were green m &amp; m &apos;s in it , too .
everyone else thought it was gross .
mommy !
so you &apos;re having surgery to put in a shunt .
it &apos;s for the dialysis .
and how long will you need to have this ?
till they find me a donor .
well , that won &apos;t take very long , will it ?
three to five years .
it &apos;s weird .
i &apos;m going through this whole thing like it was a movie .
it was happening to someone else .
but now ...
it &apos;s real .
so i need to ask you guys something .
of course . what is it ?
if something happens to me ...
i need to know if you &apos;ll be there
to help ... mike with m.j.
honey , you &apos;ll come through this with flying colors .
yeah , nothing &apos;s gonna happen to you .
absolutely . yes . we &apos;ll be there .
my hero .
save it . i had nothing to do with what happened .
could you do me a favor next time ?
a little down ... and to the right .
there &apos;s not gonna be a next time .
there wasn &apos;t a this time .
i thought you said you &apos;d think about it .
that &apos;s what you said , and i told you &quot; no . &quot;
i didn &apos;t do it .
then who did ?
something happened in the suburbs last week .
a man was shot outside his home .
detectives were called to investigate ...
and they soon learned this man had enemies ...
some he was not even aware of .
we &apos;re sorry to disturb you again , sir .
not at all . any luck with the investigation ?
is your wife here ?
she &apos;s in the cafeteria .
do you mind ? it &apos;s a bit of a delicate matter .
what &apos;s going on ?
sir , when we questioned you
about any enemies you might have ,
you didn &apos;t mention your mother @-@ in @-@ law .
my mother @-@ in @-@ law ? what are you talking about ?
uh , we did a little checking into your wife &apos;s background .
why didn &apos;t you tell us
her mother framed you for her own murder ?
i mean , come on . we know she &apos;s in jail ,
but felicia tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths
to cause you harm .
are you sure there isn &apos;t a possibility
that she somehow was involved in this ?
not at all . that &apos;s water under the bridge .
with love and prayer ,
felicia and i have resolved the issues between us .
okay . if anything else turns up ,
we &apos;ll let you know .
i appreciate it .
oh , and , officers ?
thank you for not bringing this up in front of my wife .
