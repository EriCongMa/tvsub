Come on! Come on, dog! Come on!
Come on! Come on.
Look at this! Look at this plastic!
And there's weeds!
Well, it looks like Tobacco Road.
Nobody gets down here.
Anthony!
Those dogs are wild dogs.
Cemetery dogs.
They'll take your hand off.
Come over here. Say a Hail Mary for your grandfather.
Lay off. He's a kid.
So he should neglect his elders? Just like his father.
Yeah, a real skimp.
My son.
The mental patient.
Remember those trips to the shore? Me and Tony rode the waves?
I taught him to bodysurf.
My son was brought up right.
He needs a psychiatrist for what?
To talk about his sex life?
Enough.
I hate it as much as you do.
Those dogs could start foaming at the mouth.
How come you're not supposed to breathe in the cemetery?
Who says?
It's a joke. Say, "Why?"
You'll make the dead people jealous.
Okay, come pick it up! Pick it up.
Who's got the ball?!
Oh, my God! Look out!
Come around, come around!
Up, up, up! Cover them through!
I can't watch.
Way to go, Meadow! You're a brick wall, baby! Brick wall!
Good save! Come on, now. Come on!
That was close.
Pretty good.
Look at you. At girls' soccer, Tony.
What do you want? My son's a couch potato.
Red! Five!
Are you yellow-card happy?
Rough play, my ass!
Hi, honey.
Go get them, baby.
This fat kid is such a sneak with that elbow!
Coach says next year, Chiara is gonna be one of his starts.
Let's pull it out, for chrissake!
Heather Dante! A hundred bucks for a goal!
What's with Ally today? She's sleepwalking out there.
She eats at our house a lot. She's got the energy.
That tackle was our ball, asshole!
Zebra, I'm talking to you.
Blow that again, I'll stick it up your ass!
Get off the field now, or your team is gonna forfeit the game!
I'm going. You fucking son of a--
Get off the field!
Did a hell of a job.
Falcons! Falcons, heads up!
Red, 42! 42!
Push! Ally!
Come on.
Come on, Al!
Did I tell you? What did I tell you?
He's a brilliant coach. A beautiful, brilliant genius.
You in love with him?
Yes. If he steers Chiara to a college scholarship,
I'll blow the guy.
You will?
How's chefing at Dimples?
Try the salad bar.
We got a chemical brightener. It keeps lettuce crisp.
How nice.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
The offer's still there. You put some out on the street...
...at two points, we split the interest. Nice?
I can't do the math. I'm an artiste.
Get out of here.
Good job, girls!
Absolutely.
And you do that so well, coach.
Thanks.
The psychology is important.
Did a hell of a job.
Welcome to Bada Bing. Everything's on the house.
Come meet somebody.
He coached college.
Get out of here.
Division 1-A.
No, that's boonie state.
Besides, it's time to stop moving my wife and Deena like pawns...
...when someone ups the ante.
Anyway, how many chances does a man get to coach his own daughter?
Money isn't everything.
Here, here.
The kids are important.
Cheers. To the Falcons. Continued success.
Brandy, why don't you give the coach a deluxe tour of the VIP lounge.
What?
Oh, guys.
Jesus, we said a beer.
No, I.... Thank you, but I don't think so.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, Brandy, go sit on a tuffet.
Coach, it's on the house.
Why are you here?
Who's he?
My girl's coach. You got something?
Every car you see in the rear-view mirror is not a fed.
Mikey Palmice went and got a major Manhattan Pl.
Mikey thinks someone here rats for the government. What else is new?
What else? My colleague over at Organized Crime Task Force...
...gets chatty after caffeine drinks.
Names of people whose fiscal interests intersect with your own.
I'm still trying to find out if you've been named.
But these people are keeping these indictments very, very internal.
They may have a folder with my name on it.
If I was smart, I wouldn't be here.
I rest my case.
I'm up the street on a rape-homicide.
What I need now is to see a liquor license, if you don't mind.
So anybody wonders why I was here or for the lie detector test....
Cha-cha, show him the liquor license.
Don't touch the girls.
How you doing?
Bada Bing. Arthur Bucco!
Hello?
You gonna stay in that bar all day?
I'm shooting pool.
I'll rack them up for you.
I thought we were supposed to paint the patio.
I bought primer and I've been scraping.
You have?
I could really use your help.
All right. I'll be right home.
This fucking guy lays down the law.
Fucking blistering. "I'll be right home."
I gotta get home too. Shelley'll be looking for me.
It's quite the lifestyle you got here.
See ya later, coach.
Okay.
Different strokes.
Melvoin, Perlov, Schneider and Archide.
What's going on with the indictments?
Put it right down there.
The book is off on the 14th ward.
I don't want to minimize your position. Two prior convictions.
You're in jeopardy of sentence under the habitual offenders statute.
I'm paying you to hear shit that's eating my insides?
Peppers and eggs?
Peppers and eggs? That's what I should've had.
"I'd be happy to surrender Mr. Soprano.
You can be assured of my full cooperation."
You'd rather they kicked in your front door at night?
It's a target letter, Corrado.
I got nowhere, so I asked them what your status was.
Just testing. So what'd they say?
They'd let me know.
I may just start paying taxes.
God, it's a fucking burn.
I'm sick and tired of sitting around. I'm gonna get out of here.
With your lady friend?
What do you know about her?
Works for the Joint Fitters Union, right?
Runs their labor management fund outside the feds' oversight.
If you can't get your friends jobs, why attain success?
The wheels of justice turn slowly.
Take her to Florida. Develop a tan.
Where's the crapper key?
Top right-hand drawer.
Junior, we're working out of a fucking lawyer's office, is that right?
Look, I didn't want to say anything, but this government case...
...if there's a leak, it's in Tony's boat.
If my nephew's in bed with the Justice Department, just say it.
Don't stammer like a spastic.
There's something fucking wrong with that guy. I feel it in my gut.
I'm worried about you, skipper.
I'm sorry, Mikey. You're a good boy.
Fuck this. I'm going to Boca.
Deena, when you guys showed up last year...
...I thought, "Soccer, give me a break."
But your dad makes it seem like this, I don't know, metaphor.
Yeah.
Dad's pretty cool.
Where's Al? She was supposed to loan me a cig.
I'll come with.
Al?
Ally!
If you're smoking, you owe me $5!
Ally, what are you doing?
Ally! Oh, my God!
Her parents split up.
So she's always at our house.
But she was born with a silver spoon.
Teenagers are under a lot of stress.
I know this kid. She's great.
Was it a genuine suicide attempt? Or was it a suicidal gesture?
"Small cutting" is the clinical term.
Is "large cutting" O.J. in missing sweats?
It's a cry for help.
Her mother says she tried this before.
A couple times.
What else is going on?
Life is putting the Prozac to the test.
It's all that business in the news?
Let's talk about my daughter.
Principal says girls in sports do better.
They don't take drugs or get knocked up.
But now this shit.
If my daughter ever tried to kill herself....
Oh, God!
Last week, I called you a whore.
I might've been...
...overstating the case a little bit.
Mr. Soprano.
Miss Sanfillipo.
A check for you to sign.
Twenty grand?
For research and development into furthering the art and science...
...of metal joint fittings.
Where does our research and development take us this time?
Well, I was thinking Boca Raton.
My, my! You read my mind.
I'm all packed.
I gotta talk to my cousin.
Mr. Soprano?
What?
I was waiting to talk to Jerry about how I could use some room...
...on this mall job I got in North Bergen.
Then I saw you here. And I thought, what the hell...
...I may as well ask the man himself.
Let's you and I meet. I can pass my recommends on to my cousin.
Mama Livia, how are you?
Do you remember me? Larry Boy Barese.
I know who you are.
You lit an apartment house on fire...
...and scared your mother half to death.
Mama's moving in here on the 15th.
Yeah? Ooh, I like your shoes.
Mama hasn't been well. Last week she threw a jar of artichokes at me.
She better not throw any artichokes at me.
How are you doing? Remember Larry?
Water under the bridge.
We're gonna take a walk.
You should get some shoes like his.
You've always been a fucking genius. But this last move is the best.
The feds'll never surveil an old folks' home.
That's why I got truckloads of bootleg Polident coming in.
There he is.
How you doing?
Did you get your mother settled in yet?
They're not sure they can accept her. They want to see my finances again.
So this office supply chain from Virginia. What's the deal on them?
I spoke to them. I think they'll listen to reason on minority hiring.
Been to any games?
What do they got?
What the fuck?
Knees high, Colgiavani!
Eyes ahead! Energy, girls, energy!
I know we're all upset, but we still have a season left.
Come on, let's go!
Hey, coach.
Fellas, sorry, but practice is closed today.
I'm trying to keep the team focused.
What are you doing?
You're leaving us? After two fucking years?
I told that reporter to wait before he put that in the paper.
Coach, look at my little girl out there.
You're breaking her heart!
Believe me, Art. I am hugely conflicted.
But Rhode Island doubled my salary!
They're giving my daughter a full ride! What could I do?
They made an offer I couldn't refuse.
You haven't heard ours.
Come on.
Look, I got a family too.
I have a daughter who loves playing soccer.
He's kidding about the offer.
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!
Let's not get lazy out here! Come on!
Go fuck yourself.
Excuse me?
Want me to tell your dad?
It's my field.
Give me 10 laps around the goals.
Whatever.
Make that 20.
Anybody else want to mouth off?
Good! Come on! Let's circle up for keep-away.
Let's go! Over here.
Get in a big circle! Go! Move it!
I need some people out here. Come on! Let's go!
Give me your glass.
Who'd think we could be this contented?
I did. As soon as I saw you, I knew.
You're a sweetheart.
If only they knew the other side of you.
They'd eat me for breakfast.
I been looking at real estate. Some nice houses on the market.
Maybe you'd like something bigger?
No, Corrado. This is our place.
You know how long we been coming here?
Sixteen years. And every one of them good.
How's junior, Junior?
He's catching some shuteye.
You're such a powerhouse.
When you kiss me down there...
...you're like a great artist.
You got a real instinct for it.
Pass me the red peppers.
You know the thrill you give?
Keep it to yourself, okay?
Yeah. All to myself.
Corrado?
Yeah?
Why the big secret?
About what?
Oral sex.
What's so terrible about pleasing a woman?
You always have to talk about it.
Well, I want to know why!
It's complicated.
Yeah. But why?
Why?
They think if you suck pussy, you'll suck anything.
You're kidding.
It's a sign of weakness. And possibly a sign that you're a finocchio.
A fag?
That's ridiculous.
How would the two even translate?
What are you gonna do?
I don't make the rules.
It's no big lifestyle choice.
My aunts Quintima and Jemma, they got money out earning on the street.
It's like being a banker. You help people.
Chiara cried when she heard the coach was leaving.
You don't want to talk. Fine.
I gotta pick up Carmela anyway.
Let me ask you a question: Why does your wife hate me?
Charmaine doesn't hate you.
You lie like I play a horn.
What?
Look at this facchino. Wearing a cap in a nice restaurant.
I hated that most when I had my restaurant. It's values today.
Standards are crumbling.
Would it kill this coach to stay until my kid graduates?
Then let him stay four years for Chiara.
That burns my ass.
Where you going?
Take your hat off.
Excuse me?
They don't sell hot dogs. They took the bleachers out.
I'll wear it where I want.
How you doing?
Thank you.
Look at him.
Douche bag. Good for you!
Send them a bottle of Montepulciano.
Get the license plate of these two guys sitting behind Artie.
They look like cops.
Well, look who's here! Hi!
Tony, look who's here.
Alphonse, how you doing?
Good.
You feeling better?
Yeah.
Gonna miss that left foot of yours.
No. It's okay, Mr. Soprano.
I'm gonna play.
No shit?
Pardon my French there.
Are you sure, Ally?
I had a long talk with Coach Hauser and....
I'm gonna play. That's all.
I told her she didn't have to.
She just said she wanted to.
Yeah.
Coach pressure you?
No, Mrs. Soprano.
He would never do that.
Pressure her? He doesn't finish what he started.
Dad!
What?
It's what we all wanted.
Okay. Right?
As long as everything's....
We're trying to watch this, okay?
Kick ass, girls, right?
Good night.
Listen, Roberta, what I said earlier?
I'm serious, you discuss that with anyone, we're gonna go 10 rounds.
We just skimmed 20,000 off the development fund...
...and you're worried about a little lecca fica?
Will you keep it down?
All right.
I'll tell everyone you're a good kisser. I just won't say where.
That's my reputation you're playing with.
Honey, my lips are sealed.
Not too sealed, right?
Visual on Corrado Soprano and female travel companion...
...2200 hours, Boca Lounge.
How's my boy today?
Go, go, go!
I'm looking for a Coach Hauser.
That's me. Petey! Come here!
Something from your friends at the Bada Bing.
Brand-new, surround sound, HDTV compatible.
Tell them thanks, but--
This is getting heavy.
If this is about Rhode Island, tell them I already signed.
I don't know what it's about. But the TV stays here. Put it down.
No! I mean it!
Pick it up! Get it off my property!
Look, pal, I don't think you quite understand.
I understand, only too well.
Tell your friends I know all about them.
If you did, you'd do what they want.
Is that a threat?
How things change. Let me tell you, Guido--
I'm Clarence.
I have friends in law enforcement, and they'd call this extortion.
Come on.
You tell those assholes Don Hauser will not be intimidated!
I will not be threatened or bribed!
I go where I want to when I want to!
Hey!
All day, every day, 85 and not one drop of rain.
And those nights.
Bobbi, you are so lucky with this guy. You have no idea.
He's a sweetheart underneath it all.
I wish I could get Lou to be like him.
More sensitive, if you know what I mean.
That coral looks good.
I don't understand why I always have to ask him for oral sex.
Not like you and your Corrado.
Bebe, listen, I know we always used to yak about our sex lives.
I think it would be better if we didn't anymore.
Okay.
I mean it.
Sure!
Just, you're lucky, that's all.
So, Ma, you coming to the game?
Game? What game?
Meadow's team is going to the sectionals.
Nobody tells me anything.
Did everybody hear me just tell her?
Can anybody think of anything else to talk about?
All right. Uncle Jun, how was Boca?
Wonderful. I don't go down enough.
That's not what I heard.
About what?
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Last time, Aunt Bobbi bought me a piranha.
A piranha? Come on!
That woman is not your aunt.
Livia, I warned you. Bobbi is a sweet, sweet girl.
What's the matter?
What did I say?
This wife of yours, she's got the giggles.
Can I be excused?
We just sat down!
How can you play if you don't eat?
You need protein.
No, I don't, because I quit.
You quit?
With Ally back, you can go to the states.
She slits her wrists, and you think of a game?
It wasn't like Cobain. It was just a little suicidal gesture.
Come back here!
You're not excused!
Let her go. Go ahead, honey!
Ma!
Why don't you butt out?
You only act nice when you want to score points.
I will not eat in this house.
Junior, take me home.
I'm not finished.
She'll come back.
The Stukas and Messerschmitts, they have command of the skies.
I don't know.
I'm glad Meadow quit.
That coach pushes them to the brink. It's unhealthy.
What do we mean when we say commitment?
He thinks he can just walk away.
Watch it, cowboy, don't start.
What's with you and Uncle Jun?
Don't bother that coach.
Come on. Tell me about Uncle Jun.
No, stop it!
I can't!
Yes, you can.
All right. Okay.
Gabby Dante's cousin and Bobbi go to the same nail parlor.
And your uncle.... No, I shouldn't say. I shouldn't!
Come on.
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, let's just say...
...your uncle has acquired a taste for her.
Uncle Jun gives head?
World-class.
He whistles to the wheat field?
Don't be disgusting.
He's a bushman of the Kalahari!
That's why I don't tell you.
You don't know when to stop!
My God, if this ever gets out....
Yeah, like you don't do it. Or any of your friends.
Bunch of hypocrites.
What goes on in this bedroom stays here, and you know that.
Once a year? I can resist the urge to gossip.
Arthur? You're home?
The grease in that Frialator.
I'm gonna smell like a cheap French fry forever.
So this is why we scrimp and save to send our kids to that school?
So our name is dragged through the mud?
What?
Shelly Hauser called me this afternoon.
Your friend sent some Y.O.'s down there with a stolen TV set...
...to try and bribe the coach.
From your friends at Bada Bing!
As if a TV set is gonna get somewhere with a man like Coach Hauser.
A TV set?
Do you honestly believe that they're gonna stop there?
They tried bribing this man.
What's next?
Always with the extreme scenarios.
No, come on. Tell me, what's next?
You grew up here.
Don't pretend like you don't know what Tony Soprano is capable of.
Who is it?
I found your dog.
What?
No, you're mistaken. My dog is upstairs.
Golden Retriever, blue nylon collar?
Honey, who is it?
Evening, ma'am.
He has our dog.
Where is Petey?
He was locked in.
Come get him.
I wouldn't want Petey to get hit by a car.
Petey, Petey!
You okay? Come here.
What, no reward?
Just kidding. I'm an animal lover.
You okay, boy?
Med, cheer up about the coach...
...because I feel he'll reconsider the big move.
Did you do something?
What could I do?
He's gonna stick around and finish what he started with the girls.
That's it.
Well, did I tell you?
Develop some appreciation, because everyone helps you...
...and all you do is bitch and moan!
This coach abandons his team, and your friends get all worked up.
So I try to do something.
Is that why you think we're upset?
Because a coach who most of us can't even stand is leaving?
You don't have to love him to be successful.
"Catfish" Hunter hated Billy Martin.
Bill Parcells' guys can't stand him, till they start to win.
Coach Hauser had sex with Ally.
What?
That's why she cut herself. That's why I've been living at her house.
All right, hold on a minute.
Maybe....
With Ally?
Meadow, this is horrible.
This is also a serious accusation. What exactly did Ally say?
That they had sex, more than once...
...that she's not a virgin anymore!
All right.
Ally's a very pretty girl.
Maybe there was....
Maybe there was confusion. Maybe she wanted to...
...look like she was sophisticated in your eyes.
What?
Tony, what if this had been Meadow?
What kind of confusion?
At her age? The coach shouldn't have been in any position...
...where there's even a remote possibility of confusion!
I'm losing my mind here.
Go downstairs so me and Meadow can talk.
Jesus fucking Christ!
God, now what did I do?
I only told so he wouldn't make Coach Hauser stay.
Meadow, this is a horrible, horrible thing.
She's in love with him. But he won't leave his wife.
Leave his wife? Meadow!
Now, he didn't touch you, right?
No.
What about Deena?
If she hears about her father, it'll destroy her.
Tell Dad to let him go anywhere he wants, okay?
Come here.
Moldonado and his brother, they'll handle it.
Mol owes me a solid.
No. No hired help. This is personal.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
I'm gonna give him a real after-school special.
You out of your mind?
What?
You kidnapped the coach's dog. But if you do one more thing--
Shut up, Arthur. You're five time zones behind your own ass.
No, I'm fucking serious. You hear me, Tony?
You're serious?
Want to hear serious?
Want to know what your coach did?
He fucked little Ally Vandermeed and who knows who else he fucked.
What are you talking about? Fucked?
That's crazy.
That's why that kid slit her wrist.
And my daughter should know?
She should have to think about that filth?
That self-righteous prick put his dick...
...in my little girl's soccer teammate.
Yeah. She's in 11th grade, for chrissake!
Oh, my God.
Chiara. He drove her home one night when it was raining.
Oh, my little girl.
Degenerate son of a bitch.
He deserves to die!
Betraying children?
Believe me, he ain't gonna be doing that shit no more.
I guarantee you that.
Nobody said to put my nephew under surveillance.
I know, Junior. I know.
I wanted to be safe and I'm glad I was.
Because your nephew isn't just at that titty bar...
...and going to soccer games.
Go ahead.
Twice last week he goes toward the medical center...
...and they lose him.
A girlfriend.
He's seeing this Russian slit very open.
Your nephew is talking to the feds.
Where else would he be going that requires such precautions?
What the fuck else would be the big secret?
What am I, a swami?
How you doing? You're looking good.
How you feel?
You shanked it, Sil.
I still got the coach on my mind.
We got fresh air, we got sunshine. Forget about that shit.
Thank God for golf some days.
I'm trying to concentrate here.
Did you get any golf in at Boca?
Fucking manners, please!
You play Manatee, or what's that other one?
Will you let the man tee off? You yap worse than six barbers!
If you'd have shut up during that Mountain Lakes game...
...you wouldn't have missed that fly ball.
I was ashamed to face my friends.
Good, Mikey. Better.
What do you mean, better?
Well, you know, it's better.
Whoa, Junior!
Whoa, Junior, what?
Uncle Jun's into muff.
What?
Oh, did I say muff? I meant ruff.
Good shot.
What's that smell? Did you guys go to a sushi bar?
What's he talking about?
I don't know.
I thought you were a baccala man. What are you doing eating sushi?
You're fucking running off at the mouth.
Listen, my friend.
At least I can deal with my own problems.
Unlike some I know.
What's that mean?
Take it however you want. Don't bullshit me.
Guys, we here to play golf or what?
Come on.
Arthur...
...everybody's just so upset.
The mother's on sedatives. She's completely unable to deal.
The father lives in Europe somewhere.
The little girl, Ally, she thinks it's all her fault.
Bastard. He won't get away with this!
You got that right.
What?
Hand me that bottle of Bug-B-Gon, will you?
Arthur, what?
Something going on, Artie?
Your mobster friend gonna do something?
If I had any balls, I would do it myself.
You do have balls. That's why you're not like him.
Fuck it.
Fuck the world!
This isn't making a slob take his hat off.
This is beating a man to death or cutting his balls off, or what?
You can't tell me he doesn't deserve it!
Okay, but....
Listen, think about what you're saying!
Yeah, you tell me.
Who's worse: Tony Soprano or that child-molesting fuck?
I trusted him. I'd like to rip his heart out of his chest!
Jesus Christ, I cannot believe you only think about yourself!
Myself?
Myself?
I resent that, Charmaine.
Junior, what the fuck? What's the matter?
What? That bullshit with the sushi?
No. I don't know what he was talking about. He babbles.
What?
You're another one!
Me? He completely lacked respect.
I'm tired of having to make excuses for him.
It isn't right.
Because he's a mental weakling.
I know.
You don't know shit!
He's seeing a psychiatrist.
How about that?
My nephew is seeing a psychiatrist. It makes me want to cry.
No shit?
The indictment's being prepared. He's spilling his guts!
I fucking knew it.
No, you didn't know it. I just told you.
God knows how much of our family business he has.
If the place is bugged...?
That's not admissible.
It's that doctor-patient privilege. Just like us and Melvoin.
Melvoin's a lawyer. He's in the fucking ballpark.
Suppose this shrink gets scared or something?
Remember those two brothers in California?
They whacked their parents?
The shrink was in a witness chair.
Shit.
Anthony wants to play games, okay.
I taught him games.
I taught him how to play baseball.
Talking about clipping him?
Nobody would slap my wrist if I did.
Guys in prison have done half the damage he has.
The judicial system has improved in dealing with sexual predators.
Oh, yeah. Let's impeach him.
If you're telling me of intent to harm him...
...I must warn you of my duty to alert law enforcement.
Why do I tell you anything?
I'm interested in why you feel punishing this man falls upon you.
It doesn't fall upon you.
What?
What would you do? You'd call the cops...
...who'd get some judge, who'd give him counseling...
...to talk about his unhappy childhood, and we could have sympathy for him.
Because he's the victim, right?
You know what you do? You ignore the truth.
Discredit psychology all you want.
But I continue to ask the question. Why do you think you...
...always have to set things right?
Hey, Paulie, is Tony in?
I got to talk to you.
I'm busy right now.
I got to talk to you.
All right. We'll finish later, all right?
Come on in.
It's about the thing.
You know what?
Nothing's happened yet, has it?
Just got to make the call.
I'm savoring the moment.
Call it off.
Don't worry about it.
You don't go near this.
I don't care about that. It's wrong, Tony.
You can't do it.
It's wrong?
What he did isn't?
I'm begging you. I hate the guy too.
What do you want to do?
Want to call the cops? Here's the phone.
They'll arrest him.
And he'll get out in two years and move north.
And then?
He'll teach girls' soccer and start all over.
You don't think I want to rip him apart like a chicken?
I drove by his house. I almost got out.
But you didn't.
Something happens to him, who does it help?
His daughter? That girl?
No. You, Tony.
And Silvio and me and whoever. It's just gonna make us feel better.
So don't even think about calling this justice. Leave it to the cops.
Look, let me ask you a question.
Who are you, coming in here talking to me like this?!
Now, your boyfriend is finished. You deal with it!
Okay?
Tony, don't do it.
This is me asking you.
Why don't you get out?!
Come on.
Get the fuck out, go!
Let's go!
Come on, come on!
Corrado?
I was worried! You usually call me when you're this late.
I bought us some barbecued chicken, salad and lemon meringue pie.
But I got hungry and ate.
Did I tell you to keep your mouth shut?!
Did I tell you to keep your goddamn mouth shut?!
Don't hit me!
You stupid fucking blabbermouth cunt!
I don't understand!
Get your pencils and your crap and don't be here tomorrow!
No, Corrado. Don't leave.
I love you!
I am so sorry!
No, Corrado!
Yeah?
You there at the place?
Is he in the house?
Fuck it. Walk away.
Just walk away. Don't do it.
Fuck!
All right.
Leave it alone.
Yeah. No problem.
Son of a bitch!
Colleagues and neighbors were shocked...
...to hear of charges brought against Hauser...
...coach of the Verbum Dei high school girls' soccer team.
Alerted by a friend of the alleged victim...
...whose name cannot be revealed...
...police issued a warrant for his arrest.
Tony, Jesus! You smell like Lord Calvert.
What is with you tonight?
What is this?
Jesus!
Mixed with alcohol!
Tony, that's wonderful. Happy trails.
Here, let's get you to bed.
I didn't hurt nobody.
