prior to implantation , your embryo
was accidentally switched with another client &apos;s .
carlos and gaby didn &apos;t get what they expected .
i &apos;m austin , edie britt &apos;s nephew .
you &apos;re not that hot .
julie met her new neighbor .
god , i love seeing you laugh .
oh , well , it &apos;s been a long time since i &apos;ve been in the mood too . thank you .
persistence paid off for susan &apos;s new friend .
you &apos;re gonna leave me in the middle of nowhere ?
and bree began to regret what she had done .
orson hodge dreamed of the perfect honeymoon .
indeed , he &apos;d begun planning it the moment
bree van de kamp agreed to marry him .
they &apos;d start by flying first class
to an exclusive five @-@ star hotel ,
where they &apos;d spend their days by the pool
and their nights making love .
and when they returned home ,
their perfect honeymoon would continue forever .
mrs. hodge .
yes , mr. hodge ?
do you have any idea how happy we &apos;re going to be ?
i don &apos;t need to be any happier than i am already
at this very second .
oh , my goodness , there &apos;s only 15 minutes before our plane .
if you want that latte , you should go now .
yeah , that &apos;s a good idea .
the population of homeless teenagers continues to climb .
this is andrew .
andrew , what is it like to live on the streets ?
it &apos;s not so bad . i mean , you know ,
sometimes people give you food .
you can find a lot in dumpsters .
uh , i mean , just last night ,
i found almost a whole bucket of chicken that had hardly been touched .
andrew told me his heart @-@ wrenching story .
an alcoholic mother ,
a father murdered by the woman &apos;s boyfriend ,
and a childhood shattered the day his mother
abandoned him on the side of the road .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing .
some people just should never be allowed to have children .
darling , i got an extra one just in case ...
bree , what &apos;s the matter ?
a reporter just did a story on homeless teens .
my son was one of them .
oh , my god .
well , we &apos;ll call child welfare the minute we get to the resort .
orson , you can &apos;t imagine that we &apos;re still going ?
darling , the tickets are non @-@ refundable .
my son is eating out of dumpsters .
yes , but think how much better you &apos;ll be able to
deal with this crisis after a nice , relaxing ...
orson ! my child is in trouble .
don &apos;t make me choose between the two of you ,
because believe me , you will lose .
now please , get your ass in gear .
it was at this moment that orson realized
the honeymoon was over ,
in more ways than one .
it was a holiday weekend on wisteria lane ,
and everyone was packing their bags ,
hoping to get away from it all .
no , no . all right , bye .
this is so unfair .
no , no ! what &apos;s unfair is that we &apos;re slowly running out of money ,
and you &apos;ve barely even looked for a job .
you &apos;re gonna have a good time , all right ? i love you . bye !
lynette was getting away from growing tension in her marriage .
you can call it blackmail , carlos ,
but the court calls it &quot; spousal support . &quot;
so unless i get a check by monday ,
your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a welcome @-@ back party .
gabrielle was getting away from an increasingly bitter divorce .
hi . i &apos;m ready .
so that &apos;s my number ,
and in case there &apos;s any change in mike &apos;s condition .
i &apos;m going to the mountains with a friend .
and uh , just in case you were wondering ,
it &apos;s strictly platonic .
he wasn &apos;t wondering .
susan was getting away from mounting guilt .
so you can &apos;t tell me anything about my son &apos;s whereabouts ?
and then there was bree ,
who had just learned there are some problems ...
fine .
you can &apos;t run away from .
some reporter . all she could tell me was
what neighborhood they found him in .
they don &apos;t have any contact information ,
no phone number , no address .
oh , dear , if he had an address ,
he wouldn &apos;t be homeless .
this really blows .
i am this close to becoming homecoming queen .
now i &apos;m gonna be that creepy girl
whose brother &apos;s a pathetic street junkie .
you know , you could show a little compassion .
your brother is out there on the streets ,
struggling to survive .
and whose fault is that ?
she &apos;s right . this is all my fault .
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
no parent can stop a child who &apos;s determined to run away .
he didn &apos;t run away .
i kicked him out .
you what ?
i left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes .
i didn &apos;t tell you because
i was afraid of what you &apos;d think of me .
you did what you had to do .
i just wish you &apos;d said something sooner .
there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t tell me .
i don &apos;t want there to be any secrets between us .
there won &apos;t be . not anymore .
you know , andrew is not the only one having a rough year .
i &apos;m the one whose boyfriend got shot right in front of her .
we &apos;ll talk in the car .
don &apos;t you love this ?
god bless tom for taking the kids camping this weekend .
it &apos;s exactly what we needed ,
especially after everything i &apos;ve been through lately .
i am all about relaxing and rejuvenating ...
gaby ?
yeah ?
could you be all about shutting up ?
i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
don &apos;t tell me you brought your cell phone .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;m waiting for carlos &apos;s lawyer to call .
this whole spousal support thing &apos;s gotten ugly .
hello ?
oh , hi , tom .
no . no , no , no .
yeah . yeah , she &apos;s right here . hang on .
did you say something ?
honey , i know it is your weekend away ,
but it &apos;s my damn back .
i threw it out again .
so ?
so i can barely sit up . the kids are running wild .
i need you to come up here .
well , why don &apos;t you take a muscle relaxant ?
honey , i &apos;ve already taken two .
they &apos;re not making a dent .
why don &apos;t you give &apos; em to the kids ?
lynette .
please , tom , please don &apos;t do this to me .
parker , for the last time ,
put down the damn axe !
oh , all right . yeah , yeah . i will be there as soon as i can .
god , i hate my life .
i know .
i wouldn &apos;t trade with you for anything .
oh , wow . look at the view .
i love when the leaves change color .
that &apos;s why i suggested this .
so we could hang out for the weekend and enjoy the , uh ...
scenery .
yeah , scenery &apos;s great .
so , um ... maybe i should unpack .
where should i do that ?
well , there are ... there are two bedrooms .
one @-@ one is mine .
and there &apos;s a guest room .
a guest room . well , that &apos;s handy .
unless , of course , you &apos;d like to sleep in my room .
in which case , i would take the guest room .
no , no . i should take the guest room because i am the guest .
yeah , well , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s up the stairs at the end of the hall .
ok .
susan , i , um ... i think i have your suitcase .
yeah , and i think i have yours .
so , did you , um , did you happen to see the , um ...
yeah .
and did you notice ... ?
hard to miss .
well , i &apos;m just gonna ...
hide pathetically in your room ?
uh @-@ huh .
me , too .
hey , lynette .
what are you doing here ?
kayla called , and she told me about tom &apos;s back .
my car got impounded again , .
so i thought that i &apos;d hitch a ride with you .
hitch ?
you mean , like , we &apos;re gonna be driving in the car together ?
well , you could strap me to the front bumper ,
but , uh , yeah , i &apos;d be more comfortable inside .
it &apos;s like an eight @-@ hour drive .
so ?
how far is the impound lot ?
i could just drive you over there and ...
what &apos;s your problem , lynette ?
i don &apos;t have a problem .
i just don &apos;t think we both need to go up there .
i can grab kayla and bring her back .
i see your plan .
you wanna go charging up on your white horse
and save everyone , and then i ge to be
the rotten mother who didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass
and stayed home eating bonbons .
no .
due to lynette &apos;s sudden departure ...
thank you .
... gabrielle was forced to spend the last night of her spa vacation alone .
but she didn &apos;t mind .
in fact , she looked forward to a quiet dinner alone with her thoughts .
unfortunately for gabrielle ,
her thoughts quickly turned to her impending divorce
and the empty house she &apos;d soon return to .
and she began to resent the happy couples
she was seeing ...
... everywhere .
what is this ? freakin &apos; noah &apos;s ark ?
guess it really is a small world .
who &apos;s there ? i can &apos;t see you .
can you see me now ?
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
i mean ... miss . i &apos;m looking for someone . his name is andrew .
have you seen him ?
hard to say , boo .
i see a lot of lost boys his age .
good @-@ iooking one , though . someone special ?
yes , very . and i &apos;m worried sick about him .
you might try the soup kitchen at st. malachi &apos;s on third .
thank you , miss ...
gates . pearly gates .
&apos;cause you can &apos;t get to heaven without going through me .
how very saucy .
great piano . do you play ?
ooh , no , i &apos;m a bit rusty .
jane loved to sing , so i &apos;d play for her .
but since the accident ...
right .
so ...
brandy , roaring fire . what could be more romantic ?
well , i can think of something .
wow , my heart is pounding .
is that a bad thing ?
consider the alternative .
your heart is beating even faster than mine .
i guess i &apos;m excited . it has been a while .
me , too .
so was that ok ?
it was bloody fantastic .
course , it &apos;s a bit different than what i &apos;m used to .
different ?
well , i was with the same woman for a long time .
but , i mean , you kissed other girls before that , right ?
sure , but most of them were 12 .
as was i. i met jane at a school dance ,
and after we started dating ,
i never looked at anyone else .
are you saying jane is the only woman you ever ...
oh , god . i so didn &apos;t want to tell you that .
why not ? i think that &apos;s adorable .
i don &apos;t want to be adorable . i want to be dashing and worldly .
ian . it &apos;s ok .
some people have a lot of lovers and some just a few .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
well , seeing as it doesn &apos;t matter ,
where do you fall on that spectrum ?
you know , how many men have you been with ?
ian .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
that was rude . i withdraw the question .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s rude . it &apos;s just immaterial .
it &apos;s just a number . it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
seeing as it doesn &apos;t mean anything ...
you know my number . it &apos;s only fair .
is it more than three ?
nine .
please tell me you were answering in german .
nine lovers is not a lot .
nine lovers does not make me a slut .
why are you getting upset ?
because it was really 11,
i knocked off two and you &apos;re still judging me .
i &apos;m not . it &apos;s just ... did you work in the recording industry ?
ok , you know , eleven is not a lot for a woman my age .
how old are you ?
what is this , the gallup poll ?
where are you going ?
to bed . alone .
it &apos;s something i &apos;ve always wanted to try
but i &apos;ve just never gotten around to .
they liked the landscaping i did so much
that they hired my company
to do the whole sinclair hotel chain .
your company ? you have a company now ?
oh , my gosh . when i met you , all you had was a bike .
well , not only that , the gardening channel &apos;s
approached me about hosting my own show .
i mean , we &apos;re still in the talking stages , but ...
what ?
nothing . i just ...
i can &apos;t get over how mature and confident you are .
you have really changed .
thanks . i was hoping you &apos;d notice .
so i guess there &apos;s no chance of getting you over
to pick the dead leaves off my ficus .
yeah , you know , i &apos;m kinda past that .
besides , i don &apos;t think mr. solis would approve .
actually , we &apos;re getting a divorce .
i &apos;m really sorry to hear that .
really ? then why are you smiling ?
i don &apos;t know . why are you ?
gabrielle .
it &apos;s really great to see you .
gabrielle .
i think that &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve ever called me that .
well , um , i hope you enjoy the rest of your stay .
i intend to .
your cuppy thing is full .
do you mind if i put this in your glove compartment ?
yeah , i do mind . i mind deeply .
jeez @-@ a @-@ marooni . i &apos;ll just get rid of &apos; em .
delightful . that &apos;s delightful .
maybe it &apos;ll just soak up the cream soda you spilled .
why do you always pick on me ?
it &apos;s like your new favorite game is finding fault with nora .
no . my favorite game is counting
all the things i &apos;m dying to say to you but i don &apos;t .
like , &quot; pipe down , you annoying nut job . &quot;
i &apos;d never say that .
you think i &apos;m crazy .
no .
you &apos;re colorful .
colorful in a way that might respond to medication .
well , you know , there &apos;s levels of crazy , lynette .
i mean , ther &apos;re people like me who just have a big personality .
and then there are the kind of people who do things like this .
oh , my god ! knock it off ! what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
lighten up . come on , it was a joke .
no , well , it wasn &apos;t funny .
if you wanna kill yourself , fine ! don &apos;t take me with you .
you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
you &apos;d really like that , if i killed myself .
that is not what i &apos;m saying .
but if you did , i &apos;d find a way to carry on .
pull over .
oh , lighten up , it &apos;s a joke .
pull the car over .
nora ...
pull it over ! pull over or i will jump out of this car .
all right , all right . i &apos;m pulling over .
jeez ! what the hell are you doing ?
hitching my way ... to the campsite !
nora , you can &apos;t be serious .
shut up !
just get outta my face . i &apos;m not talking to you .
all right , look , you &apos;ve gone from crazy to stupid .
this guy could be dangerous .
well , then , it &apos;s your lucky day , huh , lynette ?
shut up !
see ? this is what you do . you just manipulate .
you wormed your way into my family .
you conned your way into coming on this trip with me .
and now you wanna force me into saving you .
well , forget it . you wanna go , go .
no , i &apos;ve tried that . it wasn &apos;t enough power .
yeah , i &apos;m way ahead of you . all right . here it goes .
ah ! it worked . i &apos;m a genius .
oh . hi . um , i &apos;m looking for edie .
she &apos;s out .
god , where is everyone tonight ?
anything i can do ?
no . not unless you can fix a fuse box .
my science fair project blew the power out .
what &apos;s your project ?
oh , uh , it &apos;s complicated .
you think i &apos;m too dumb to understand your little project ?
it &apos;s not little .
i &apos;ve finished third in the state twice .
now , can you fix the fuse box or not ?
most houses built after 1990
are wired through a circuit breaker .
you didn &apos;t blow a fuse . you tripped a breaker .
not to challenge
a two @-@ time state science fair almost @-@ champion .
let me grab a flashlight .
maybe you could also grab a shirt .
and some pants . pants would be nice .
susan , can i come in ?
i &apos;m with a client . take a number .
susan , please .
everything i said
came out of my own insecurity and fear
that i might , well , i might disappoint you .
i was gonna stay mad at you another hour ,
but your damn accent gets me every time .
blimey , you don &apos;t say ?
don &apos;t push it .
i don &apos;t mean to break the flow , but i just ...
look , i know that i &apos;m only your second lover ever ,
and i know that means a lot .
i just don &apos;t want it to mean too much .
i &apos;m not following you .
what do you want it to mean ?
the last time you did this ,
it turned into a lifetime commitment .
i just ... i &apos;m not ready for that .
you think i am ?
well , i assure you , i &apos;m as capable of
having meaningless sex as you are .
i have never had meaningless sex .
so you were passionately in love and deeply committed
to all eleven conquests ?
don &apos;t judge me , mr. virgin plus one .
ok , ok , we seem to have gotten off
on the wrong foot again . susan ...
cheerio ? bob &apos;s your uncle ?
get out .
can &apos;t we at least talk ?
why ? you know every time we do we just get angry .
we &apos;re still getting to know each other .
that &apos;s good .
you &apos;ve learned i &apos;m a tad insecure .
i &apos;ve learned you &apos;re a wee bit touchy .
ian , you know what ? this is not happening .
i am just going to sleep
and you can just drive me home in the morning .
excuse me . i &apos;m looking for my son . have you seen him ?
have you seen him ?
excuse me , young man . have you seen this boy ?
andrew . oh , my god . thank god .
what are you doing here ?
looking for you .
how did you get that bruise ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
andrew , please .
shouldn &apos;t you be taking care of your new husband ?
how did you find out ... ?
i read it in the paper .
you know . the one i sleep under .
you have every right to be angry .
but if you knew how sorry i am ...
if you came sucking after forgiveness ,
you came to the wrong place .
can &apos;t we just talk about this ?
i &apos;m your mother , for god &apos;s sakes .
you &apos;re my son .
no , you dumped your son
at a gas station seven months ago .
i &apos;m somebody else now .
andrew .
andrew !
andrew , please !
andrew !
what happened to your ride ?
the guy grabbed my boob ,
so i hit him with his bong and i got out .
look , i &apos;m sorry i freaked out there before .
it &apos;s just when you made that crack about suicide ,
it just kinda hit home .
oh , my god , nora . did you actually ... ?
well , i &apos;m very sorry . i had no idea .
but your life is better now , right ?
you have a beautiful daughter .
and you have that fun job at the pancake house .
oh , yeah , my life &apos;s better .
but it &apos;s not your life .
your life &apos;s perfect .
excuse me ?
did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it ?
it &apos;s just , you have it all .
you have the kids . you have the career .
you have the husband . you &apos;re supermom .
and you think that &apos;s easy ?
ok , i have a good life . yes . yes , i am very lucky .
but i work 12 hours a day , and then i come home
to what seems like 33 children
and a husband who refuses to get a job .
believe me , there is not a supermom out there
who wouldn &apos;t trade in her cape for a chance to read a book
and get a massage by a man
who has the decency to leave when it &apos;s over .
ok . sorry i brought it up .
i &apos;m sorry i said that about tom .
he &apos;s doing his best to find a job .
maybe he &apos;d try a little harder
if he didn &apos;t hate advertising so much .
he doesn &apos;t hate advertising .
last week , when he came to pick up kayla
and he &apos;d just come from some crappy interview ,
he said that he &apos;d hated the ad game for , like , freakin &apos; ever ,
and would like to bag the whole thing .
he said that to you ?
he &apos;s never told me that .
he &apos;s probably afraid to .
why would he be afraid ?
because you &apos;re the kind of woman who ,
when someone says they wanna kill themselves ,
you say , &quot; go ahead . &quot;
sure you don &apos;t wanna come in ?
no , i &apos;m good .
you really should see what i &apos;m doing .
you know , for next time .
ok , here &apos;s the tripped switch .
so , first you move it to &quot; off &apos; to reset ,
then you press it to &quot; on . &quot;
that &apos;s it ?
yeah .
you didn &apos;t have to come all the way over here .
you could &apos;ve just explained it to me .
yeah , i guess i could have .
well , hello there .
edie , hi .
oh , sorry . uh , he was helping me get the lights back on .
i ... i overloaded my circuits .
i can see that .
so she &apos;s doing some big science project
and she needed me to explain how electricity works .
i think that &apos;s called irony .
julie , where &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s on a trip . do you need something ?
yeah . back when i could stand her
i loaned her my cd player .
i need it .
she took it to the hospital . for mike .
oh , god .
this florence nightingale act is really chapping my ass .
hey , science guy , i have an experiment for you .
go home , mix two ounces of gin , a splash of vermouth
and see if it improves my mood when i drink it .
julie , sweetie , you &apos;re a good girl .
do yourself a favor . stay away from my nephew .
oh , oh ! trust me , i have no interest
in swaggering , muscle @-@ bound juvenile delinquents .
honey , that &apos;s what every good girl says
just before she becomes a bad girl .
trust me . i know .
just like old times , huh ?
except now when we &apos;ve done i don &apos;t have to proofread
your essay on ethan frome .
and i don &apos;t have to jump out of a window .
that &apos;s a nice change .
hey , how about i order up a bottle of d.o.m ?
i like rich john .
hello ?
oh , hi .
nothing . you know ,
just room service and a movie .
what ?
really ? you &apos;re kidding ?
no , i &apos;m thrilled .
it &apos;s room 424 .
me , too . bye .
you gotta get out of here .
what ?
my fiance &apos;s on her way up .
your fiance ?
she was supposed to come tomorrow .
she decided to surprise me . get dressed .
you &apos;re engaged ? to who ?
her name &apos;s tammy . where &apos;s your other shoe ?
i would never have let you seduce me
if i knew you were getting married .
you don &apos;t have any problem sleeping with me
when you were married ?
you knew about carlos .
my cheating was upfront and honest .
gabby , we don &apos;t have time for this .
get moving .
no . i &apos;m not going anywhere .
in fact , i wanna meet the blushing bride .
listen to me . her name is tammy sinclair .
as in sinclair hotels .
her father owns this whole damn chain .
so if she catches you in here , i am totally screwed .
poodle !
look at you , surprising me .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
this room blows .
daddy was supposed to hook us up with a suite .
you know ... you &apos;re right .
why don &apos;t we go down to the front desk and demand one ?
come on .
no , they &apos;re all booked .
they call this a closet ?
where am i supposed to put all my stuff ?
you know , i could really use a drink .
why don &apos;t we go down to the bar ?
i &apos;m wiped . i just wanna stay in .
didn &apos;t you unpack yet ?
no , actually , the zipper is stuck .
but they have a guy at the hotel that can fix it .
i should probably go ahead and take it down to the lobby .
now ?
i &apos;m horny .
so am i.
but i will be a lot hornier once i get rid of this suitcase .
poodle , where did this diamond watch come from ?
oh , shoot .
that &apos;s what you get for surprising me .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to wrap it .
you like it ?
i love it .
i &apos;m never taking it off .
son of a bitch .
come here , you .
john ?
john , where are you , damn it .
don &apos;t laugh . i saved a bundle on airfare .
susan , i &apos;m so ...
keep playing .
your azaleas are breathtaking .
thank you .
you should be very proud of them .
yeah , it &apos;s nice to know that i can raise some things correctly .
darling , be patient .
andrew will come around .
no , i don &apos;t think he will .
i failed him .
you &apos;re being too hard on yourself .
you &apos;re not being hard enough .
stop saying what i did was understandable .
i &apos;m a mother who abandoned her child .
that &apos;s unnatural .
it &apos;s hot , you &apos;re tired . why don &apos;t you come inside ?
because there &apos;s a bottle of chardonnay in the refrigerator .
and right now this little chore
is the only thing that &apos;s keeping me
from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing .
the azaleas really are lovely .
yes , they are , aren &apos;t they ?
hi .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
here &apos;s your watch . guess i &apos;ll just buy tammy a new one .
don &apos;t you mean her daddy will buy her one
and launder the money through you ?
i don &apos;t blame you for being angry .
i should have told you the truth from the start .
but when i saw you there in the moonlight ,
it took me right back to when we were together .
me , too .
do you wanna sit down ?
you know , you &apos;re pretty hard to stay mad at .
good . &apos; cause i really didn &apos;t want this to end badly .
who says it has to end ?
what are you talking about ?
well , i &apos;m single now .
and i thought we could maybe ...
gabby , i &apos;m getting married .
sure . and i was married when we got together .
right , but that is not how i &apos;m gonna be married .
well , that &apos;s what i thought ,
but , trust me , marriage is hard .
i know that .
but i love tammy , and i don &apos;t wanna screw it up .
&apos;cause enough of those screwups and you just end up alone .
yeah , that can happen .
goodbye , gabrielle .
hey , mister , could you spare a buck or two ?
i &apos;m really hungry .
hey , thanks .
i &apos;ll give you fifty more , you let me buy you lunch .
fries and a large root beer .
what do i have to do to earn this ?
i told you , i just wanna talk to you .
you &apos;re another reporter ?
no .
you a youth pastor ?
you trying to save my soul ?
you make it sound like a challenge .
no , i just wanna understand you , andrew .
hey , how did you know my name ?
you &apos;re him , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re , uh , the new husband .
orson .
if i wouldn &apos;t talk to her ,
what makes her think i &apos;ll listen to you ?
your mother doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
all right , dad . what do you wanna talk about , dad ?
i wanna know how you survive out here .
what do you do for money ?
i ask . people give it to me .
that &apos;s it ?
wha ... ? what do you wanna know ?
have i done stuff for money that i &apos;m not proud of ?
yeah , sure , but you figured that out
as soon as i asked you what the fifty was for .
but , uh ... don &apos;t tell my mom .
or you know what ? do . who cares ?
part of you wants me to tell her
because you know how much it would hurt her .
i mean , that &apos;s why you &apos;re out here , isn &apos;t it ? to punish her .
when will you have punished her enough , andrew ?
when you turn to drugs to numb the pain ,
catch a disease you &apos;ll never be rid of ?
don &apos;t pretend to care about me , all right ?
i do care about you , because bree cares about you .
and because we &apos;re more alike than you think .
i know about rage .
i know how it eats you up . but rage goes away .
and when it does , you &apos;re just left with the mess you &apos;ve made .
thanks for lunch .
you change your mind , you know where to find us .
how &apos;s your back ?
if i don &apos;t breathe , great .
god , it has been so long since my back has acted up .
then , wham ! out of the blue , i &apos;m crying by a tree stump .
well , you &apos;re under a lot of stress .
you got a new kid in the family , you &apos;re job @-@ hunting ...
are we gonna fight again ?
if so , i need those last four muscle relaxants .
no , i don &apos;t wanna fight .
in fact , i was thinking ...
... if you can &apos;t find something you like in advertising ,
maybe you should cast a wider net .
meaning what ?
you &apos;re a bright guy .
isn &apos;t there anything else you might wanna do ?
i &apos;d like to play bass for aerosmith .
ok , let &apos;s call that the backup plan .
but , seriously , don &apos;t you have some road not taken ,
some dream you never got around to ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
maybe ?
i don &apos;t know , you get married , you have kids ,
and ... lose track of that stuff .
well , think about it , ok ?
&apos;cause whatever you wanna do , i &apos;m in your corner .
man , did i luck out marrying you .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
hi , mike .
it &apos;s edie .
i &apos;m sorry that i haven &apos;t come by to visit .
pretty rough luck , huh ?
anyway , i &apos;m here to pick up my cd player , so ...
well , i hope you feel better soon .
damn .
and that &apos;s with the coma .
we all carry something with us .
of course , it &apos;s nice if we travel with someone
who can help lighten the load .
but usually it &apos;s easier to just drop what we &apos;ve been carrying ,
so we can get home that much sooner .
assuming , of course , there will be someone there
to greet us when we arrive .
why do we clutch at this baggage ,
even when we &apos;re desperate to move on ?
because we all know there &apos;s a chance
we might let go too soon .
