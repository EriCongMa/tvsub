ooh @-@ hoo @-@ hoo , yeah . i like those boobies .
sweet little &apos; 70s boobies .
bra burning , feminist boobies .
bouncin &apos; around like they ain &apos;t go no sense .
you like 1970s cans ?
see , not me-- i &apos;m a 1950s guy .
post @-@ korean war ,
pre @-@ vietnam war .
my nana has those .
okay .
check it out .
holy cow .
almost too big .
too big .
way too big .
those are intimidating , right ?
too small . gotta be able to palm a basketball ,
if you want to slam or jam or dunk it .
see , they &apos;re too straight for me , you know ?
i like &apos; em going in two different directions .
like- like cookie monster .
oh , yeah , like his eyes .
ooh . now , see , my boobs got to go &quot; ooh ! &quot;
yeah .
oh , my god .
you guys are ruling women out based on their breast size ?
it &apos;s the least important part of a woman &apos;s body .
unless you &apos;re a baby . are you guys babies ?
we &apos;re not babies .
i &apos;d like to think that ...
that you guys see value in women &apos;s bodies other than
just the way they look .
come on , jess ,
you &apos;re really gonna tell me
that you don &apos;t care what a guy looks like ?
well ...
i &apos;ll notice an attractive man .
i can go to the butcher and pick out a nice rump .
but i &apos;m not gonna rule out a guy
based on how he looks-- that &apos;s shallow .
that &apos;s crazy .
yeah , right .
that explains ... so much .
what ?
okay , if you saw me in the bar and i was a stranger ,
would you rule me out based on my breast size ?
absolutely not . your breasts are perfect .
now , if i saw your wonky knee ?
that &apos;s a whole &apos; nother ballgame .
what w ...
wonky knee ?
you have a wonky knee ?
you think i have a wonky knee ?
the left knee &apos;s perfect .
uh , but the right one &apos;s got some stuff .
why ?
well , stuff .
oh , why do you think i always let you
take your own pants off before sex ?
because you &apos;re the laziest person i &apos;ve ever met .
wonky knee , huh ?
like big bird ?
i have a sesame street problem .
this is what &apos;s wrong with men in this country .
you all sit around all day
and you read your porno magazines
what &apos;s a porno magazine ?
and you think that &apos;s what women are supposed to look like .
well , i have news for you , okay ?
real women are wonky .
perhaps . but , like climate change ,
we pretend they don &apos;t exist .
right ?
do you guys all just think you &apos;re so perfect ?
yeah .
pretty close .
ah , please .
i mean , you &apos;re an eight , you &apos;re an eight and a half .
everybody knows i &apos;m a sweet , sweet six .
winston , for the last time ,
stop rating us .
jess , i know i &apos;m not perfect ,
but if you &apos;re asking me if i judge ,
you know , women based off their breasts ,
then the answer is yes .
everybody knows that boobs are a direct indicator of personality .
all right ... what are you guys doing ?
yeah , how you walking on this thing ?
that knee is not architecturally sound .
i don &apos;t trust it . man , if you had a jacket on
with a bunch of yellow feathers ,
i &apos;d be done !
i &apos;ve had enough . this is ... insulting .
i &apos;m so sorry ,
i know i don &apos;t know you ,
i know this is your booth , but , uh ,
my friends are really pissing me off .
i &apos;m just gonna sit here for like ...
five minutes .
or maybe ten .
15 to 20 at the most .
probably an hour .
they &apos;re super annoying to me .
okay .
why are you mad at your friends ?
they &apos;re so shallow . they &apos;re like ...
they say that they have a boob shape preference ,
but when the chips are down , they &apos;ll take anything .
so would it be bad
if i told you that i think you &apos;re hot ?
shut your gross , beautiful face .
no , i &apos;d love it . thank you .
hi . i &apos;m matt .
i &apos;m jessica .
pleasure to meet you .
hey , you , uh ,
you want to maybe ... go out some time ?
yes , i do . yes .
should i put my number in your phone or ...
yeah , that &apos;s ... that works .
great .
works for me .
but , you know ,
while @-@ while we &apos;re on the subject of stupid physical stuff ,
you know , i should probably tell you before we go out ,
i have a micropenis .
cool . what ?
it &apos;s a medical condition--
it means i &apos;m unusually small .
technically , &quot; micro . &quot;
well ...
lucky for you ...
my eyes are bigger than my stomach .
i don &apos;t know ... what that means .
but i &apos;m free tomorrow night .
it &apos;s an actual medical condition .
here &apos;s a web page all about it .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m looking at . where is the ...
it &apos;s right there . i think . yeah .
no .
it &apos;s like a single tent in a ...
a vast , dark forest .
it &apos;s like the letter &quot; i &quot;
floating around in a bowl of alphabet soup .
oh , that &apos;s awesome-- an anteater &apos;s being born .
winston , it &apos;s a micropenis , bro .
that &apos;s a grown man ?
oh , my goodness .
oh , my god .
come on , guys , stop it .
this is exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
are you honestly going on a date
with somebody who has one of these ?
yes , i am , &apos; cause i don &apos;t care what a guy &apos;s body looks like .
you know what revs me up ?
a fertile mind and a gentle spirit .
a nice , smart guy ...
how do you know he &apos;s nice ?
you barely know him .
man made it through middle school with that ghoulish raisin .
he &apos;s a hero .
i bet you &apos;re not gonna last a week with this guy .
i bet i last at least a month .
you want to put money down ?
oh , absolutely .
500 bucks .
all right .
great .
you said yeah ?
if i date him a month , then you will donate 500 bucks
to the national organization for women &apos;s love your body campaign .
and if you win ,
i will get you a subscription
to the porn site of your choosing .
really ?
yeah .
nubile nubian butts .
we know , dude .
shut up , winston .
we &apos;re gonna go with ass chat .
ass chat ? come on , what is that--
two butts talking to each other ?
it &apos;s not butts talking to each other .
no , it &apos;s all a lot categories .
i &apos;d like you to realize , someday ,
that a nice , sweet guy
who just happens to have a little squeaker
is just as attractive as a guy with a blue @-@ ribbon hog
that &apos;s ready for market .
honey , if you have a blue @-@ ribbon hog ,
you don &apos;t take it to the market , you breed that pig .
&apos;cause what &apos;s he gonna do at the market ?
shut up , nick .
you know what i mean ?
winston , honestly ...
i &apos;m sure the national organization of women
will look forward to your donation .
hey , boys , want you push heavy up ?
get &apos; em , heavy .
we got us a bet .
so i &apos;m like &quot; screw it grandma
i &apos;m @-@ a become a street artist , yo . &quot;
i mean , most people see a wall and they just see a wall .
i look at a wall and i see , like ...
a goat in a backpack .
right .
like , a ninja handing out cheeseburgers .
a chill alien , you know ?
well , who doesn &apos;t see a chill alien ?
that &apos;s my question .
lot of people .
lot of people . it &apos;s sad .
you have any tattoos ?
no .
i got seven .
oh , good .
check it .
okay .
custom font .
i invented that font .
star .
i have a question--
do you know of a web site called &quot; ass chat &quot;
and do you know if it &apos;s socially conscious ?
just based off the name , i &apos;d say , probably , yeah .
okay , so you guys are kind of bringing the bar vibe down ,
and i need tips , so ...
pretend that you &apos;re having fun
or pay for me to go to college .
you know , if i could give that poor man some of my penis , i would .
but , obviously , you don &apos;t pull a bumper off a ferrari .
it did go fast , i &apos;ll give it that .
you know , when i look at that picture , i think to myself ,
&quot; is there a god ? and if @-@ if there is ,
did he run out of clay ? &quot;
i just put five dollars in the jukebox .
we got a paula cole rock block coming our way .
i &apos;m just so thankful , you know ?
here we are , beautiful as all heck .
normal to above @-@ normal endowments .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s like why were we given so much
while others were given so little ?
i don &apos;t understand .
you know , i look at you and i see a stunning physical specimen .
it &apos;s like you were created in a la ... in a lab .
full of gay scientists .
you have a perfect body , my friend .
you &apos;re like the only jewish greek god ...
hercules .
thanks , buddy .
you &apos;re cute as a button , bro .
appreciate that .
you &apos;re swoll , my friend .
no , look , i work at it .
you &apos;re super swoll .
no , it &apos;s something i work at .
no , i mean that , though .
it doesn &apos;t happen overnight .
it &apos;s something that i put the work in ,
just like you do .
you look good , dude .
we &apos;re blessed , the two of us .
beyond blessed .
just ... i feel like we should be doing more
to share our beauty with the world .
right ?
it &apos;s frustrating .
it &apos;s fru ... it &apos;s frustrating .
so frustrating .
let me ask you something , guys ,
have you ever considered modeling ?
now , that would be a great way
to share your beauty with the world .
that &apos;s crazy .
what ? winston , we &apos;re grown men with real jobs .
modeling is a real job and , trust me ,
neither one of you could do it .
what ?
give me a break , cece .
i could model in my sleep .
modeling is exactly
what these two should be doing .
i bet they would take some amazing pictures .
a drunk baby with a phone in its mouth
couldn &apos;t take a bad picture of you two .
oh , well ...
i mean ...
i mean , i mean .
nick .
yeah .
nick , um ,
uh , i need out of the bet .
yeah . no , seriously , &apos; cause ,
he &apos;s coming out of the bathroom soon ,
and , um , he &apos;s actually ... he &apos;s the worst .
so the date &apos;s not going well .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
it &apos;s not &apos; cause of the thing .
first of all , he &apos;s a street artist ; second of all ,
he called a scotch on the rocks a sko ro .
ooh , that hurts .
i can &apos;t date him for a month--
like , i can &apos;t even spend like , five minutes with him .
yeah .
so you have to let me out of the bet , please .
you &apos;re saying a lot of words , but all i &apos;m hearing is ,
&quot; he &apos;s too small . &quot;
no . it &apos;s not because of that . he has a ...
he has a tattoo that just says &quot; warrior poet . &quot;
sounds to me like you &apos;re being pretty shallow , jess .
no . he tipped the waiter with a sketch of a hip @-@ hop mouse .
he did ?
yes !
that &apos;s incredible .
what &apos;s up , man ?
what &apos;s up , man ?
do you mind my if i graffiti your bathroom ?
i want to paint a skylight
on the floor that looks into hell .
oh ... no , that &apos;s okay . i &apos;d prefer if you didn &apos;t .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m positive .
okay .
he &apos;s wearing skinny jeans .
they fit him like sweatpants .
thinking of asking this lovely lady on a second date ?
no diggity , no doubt .
we can go speaker shopping , drink some sko ros ,
if that &apos;s where the rhythm takes us ...
um , unfortunately , i will be
out of town for the next month .
oh , for trues ?
yeah , for trues .
hello . this drink is for you , from those gentlemen over there .
you the man .
skol !
do you know those bros ?
nope .
anyway , i &apos;m gonna be out of town for a month ,
but , uh , we can go out on another date , perhaps when i &apos;m back .
technically , our , um , one @-@ month anniversary .
jess , you &apos;re not going away for a month .
she keeps forgetting that that got canceled . you &apos;re available .
no , but you keep forgetting it was rescheduled .
you weren &apos;t on the e @-@ mail .
okay . that doesn &apos;t sound for trues .
for true .
you &apos;re not really going out of town , are you ?
oh , gosh . uh , matt ...
if i &apos;m being honest , i don &apos;t think we should go on a second date .
i get it .
yeah .
it &apos;s because of my micropenis .
no !
i looked it up and i @-@ i actually feel like i could make that work .
no , it &apos;s ...
don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but ...
it &apos;s actually your personality and everything about you .
you think i &apos;m a douche bag .
you said that you thought street art was the closest thing
to an education homeless people would ever get .
okay .
and i when i asked you , &quot; is that a joke ? &quot; you said ...
your mom is a joke .
yeah . you said , &quot; your mom is a joke . &quot;
right ? that &apos;s kind of a douchey response .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i mean , i &apos;ve been made fun of my entire life--
in school , in locker rooms--
so , yeah , i can be a douche bag sometimes .
but i &apos;m this way ...
because of my micropenis .
later .
radiant .
yes , yes .
you don &apos;t even need this bounce board .
you &apos;re making your own light , man .
no doubt , no doubt .
winston , you getting this ?
oh , hell , yeah , dude .
i &apos;m getting all of this .
flawless .
yeah , there you go . all right .
now give me some stuff like it &apos;s the first day of school , right ?
okay .
that &apos;s right , and you got your backpack on .
yeah , there you go .
but you packed your own lunch .
but what you don &apos;t know is when you were making it ,
you got some mustard on your forehead .
that &apos;s right .
now you &apos;re playing pictionary , okay ?
now you &apos;re playing pictionary , and what do you ...
ooh , now i got ... now i got my little card . what am i gonna draw ?
what am i gonna draw ? you get sardines .
they don &apos;t smell good . how do i draw a smell ?
how do i draw a smell ? what does that look like ?
that &apos;s modeling . that &apos;s right .
wow , this is great .
hey , give me five . i got to protein @-@ load .
what do you see we split that last packet of power goo .
i cannot believe that this actually worked .
oh , man ...
no , that &apos;s a lie--
i would &apos;ve been surprised if it didn &apos;t .
a classic cece @-@ winston mess around .
that &apos;s not a thing .
all right .
so , guys , i was looking at the shots here ,
and they &apos;re really incredible .
i think i could call my modeling agent , if you want .
i know this ... we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re , like ,
just doing this for fun and everything ,
but part of me wants that to happen
more than anything else in the whole wide world .
no , but my agent probably would only want one of you ,
and you guys are a team , so i shouldn &apos;t call .
hold on .
you don &apos;t want to be rude to the man .
no , no , no , no , no . we don &apos;t want to see you guys
pitted against each other .
p @-@ pitted against each other ?
what are you talking about ?
i think , you know ...
i &apos;m more runway . he &apos;s more ...
yeah , i feel like i &apos;m more catalog ,
... catalog ,
high fashion .
back of the mag .
you &apos;re t ... you &apos;re too big for high fashion .
also , my agent really loves piggyback shots , so ...
we should piggyback .
we &apos;ll piggyback right now .
let me get on , man .
you get on me .
i didn &apos;t know you guys had it in you .
i want to be on the bottom .
let me be on the bottom .
yeah , yeah , you &apos;re a little piggy .
bottom &apos;s my game , dude .
no , me ...
you went to the market . yeah , yeah , yeah .
little piggy went to the market .
just let me ...
damn it .
oh , yeah .
no .
it &apos;s like shooting candy into a baby .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
yeah , give me that . give me that !
i could ... i could ... i can totally dig this .
hey , jess .
i know you &apos;re bummed and so i hate to do this ,
but i want to look at porn and you owe me a year &apos;s worth .
yeah , okay . you know what ?
you earned this porn .
and the vip pass .
and the &quot; kitty room live cam experience . &quot;
do you really need all of this ?
just click the boxes .
matt was right . i am shallow .
it &apos;s like i jumped to a conclusion about him ,
but i didn &apos;t have the whole story .
i thought i was better than you guys .
but i &apos;m a superficial size queen .
hey , guys ?
can you tell schmidt that my portfolio
is way better than his portfolio ?
look at that : i &apos;m better wet ,
i &apos;m better dry , my sexy baby is way more believable than his .
watch , look-- mama change baby &apos; cause baby made a dirty ...
okay , mine is way more sexy .
there are people lining up in the streets
to have sex with my baby .
liar !
i don &apos;t like this .
you can &apos;t use that photo , unless you &apos;re planning on posing
for the tiny nipples of america foundation .
yeah , you &apos;re one to talk , little miss princess waist !
hey , i &apos;m a 26 ! that &apos;s normal !
yeah , in asia .

depression @-@ era garbage man ?
i &apos;ve been holding that in for two years .
i said one thing .
guys , stop attacking each other !
come on . he &apos;s making fun of you
&apos;cause he feels sensitive about his geisha waist .
and you &apos;re putting him down
&apos;cause you &apos;ve got those cute little kitten teats .
everybody has something .
she &apos;s right , you know . she &apos;s right .
look , i grew up fat , and i have scars that you can &apos;t see .
and i &apos;m not talking about the stretch marks
that i had removed by laser beams .
no matter how many miles i run ,
i &apos;ll never outrun that feeling .
damn , son .
i didn &apos;t even know it was like that .
it &apos;ll always be like that , my man .
still better than having a micro penis .
so much better . yeah .
it &apos;s true . guys !
we &apos;re all covered in micro penises .
no , i &apos;m not .
come again ?
no , thank you .
i don &apos;t want to be covered in anything .

yes ! yes ! no ! we all have flaws !
we &apos;re all freaks !
all of us .
we have to support each other !
i knew it !
i am better than you guys .

i &apos;m saying that we should all celebrate our flaws ! together !
i &apos;m saying that ...

okay , why are you not running after your girlfriend right now ?
if i &apos;m being totally honest ,
she was getting a little fat .

i wouldn &apos;t behave like this if someone , just once ...
just once , took the time to get to know ...
you &apos;re not even crying ! you are unbelievable !
is anything about you real ?
anything ? do you even have a micro penis ,
or is that ... ?
it ... it ... looks like a ...
little tiny ...
pigeon &apos;s egg .

no , i definitely , definitely do not .
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re a very complicated person .
but i &apos;m glad i met you .

i mean , i don &apos;t know why , but ... i kind of am .
anyway , take care of that little rug @-@ rat .
he needs you .
hey , man .

&quot; classical guitarist loses a shoe . &quot;
that guy &apos;s never gonna find his shoe .
i don &apos;t know . this is &quot; cuddles with tigers . &quot;
it &apos;s good .
this is &quot; how did i get up here ? &quot;
what do you think about this one ?
&quot; kiss the cook . &quot; see , i like &quot; kiss the cook . &quot;
it &apos;s catalogue .
his lips are popping .
there &apos;s an accessibility with this one that i feel like ...
schmidt , relax . i &apos;m bowing out .
i want you to have this .
come on . what ? !
why are you doing that , coach ?
because you obviously need this more than i do .
when you look in the mirror , you see a fat kid .
i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t know how that feels .
i do . it &apos;s my micro @-@ p , yo .
if there &apos;s anything that could finally help you
get over your body image issues , it &apos;s modeling .
that &apos;s for sure .
yeah .
&apos;cause you &apos;re not a fat kid anymore , man .
you are a model .
now , say it .
i don &apos;t know .
say , &quot; i &apos;m a model . &quot;
i &apos;m a model .
say it louder .
it doesn &apos;t feel real .
i need to hear you say it , or else i &apos;m not gonna believe it , man .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s hard ... i &apos;m a model .
that &apos;s better .
hold on .
i &apos;m a model .
good .
i &apos;m a male model ...

was all this a classic cece and winston mess @-@ around ? !
no !
yes . yeah .
do not acknowledge that is a thing . it &apos;s not a thing .
now , look , okay , look ,
we got a little carried away ,
but how are we supposed to know
he was gonna get emotionally invested ?
this will destroy him . you know that , right ?
you two got to make him a model .
i did not mean to hurt schmidt , okay ?
but i can &apos;t make him into a model !
not in modern @-@ day america .
in 1970s israel ...
maybe .
get ... it ... done .
i hate when schmidt cries .
sounds like a ghost singing &quot; hey ya ! &quot;
fix it !
it &apos;s glorious , isn &apos;t it ?
how did this happen ?
are there just no laws in koreatown ?
uh , well , uh ,
cece &apos;s agent saw schmidt &apos;s portfolio and loved it .
yeah , yeah , he , uh ... he fast @-@ tracked it .
that @-@ that &apos;s an industry term .
so , what am i selling here anyway ?
oh , uh , you know , uh ,
korean @-@ jewish interrelations .
all right .
i wanted to tell you that , um ,
the bank cancelled my credit card after i ordered you porn .
that &apos;s okay , i wanted to cancel it anyway .
you paying for it kind of killed it for me .
yeah .
just made me sad for everybody involved .
i wanted to give those girls a hug and say ,
&quot; wipe your face , go back to school , honey . &quot;
so , guys , when does schmidt get paid for this ?
well ...
the agency is pretty tapped
after spending $ 1,887 on this billboard .
well , why don &apos;t the jew @-@ koreans pay for it ?
well , it &apos;s an international thing .
see ? so , there &apos;s fees .
yeah , but you said
he would get a check for $ 500 .
yes !
congrats , bro . you deserve that $ 500 .
let &apos;s head out .
i think i &apos;m gonna stay here for a little bit ,
take this all in .
