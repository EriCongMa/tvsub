Stop!
Careful.
Okay.
This is truly magnificent.
I don't know what to say.
I do -- yuck.
Cavanaugh's gonna kill you
for dragging this hunk of junk in here.
This is a Gia Dupont original.
I should've brought you to more museums.
Then maybe you'd appreciate art.
What, so a decomposing pinto is art?
Least you bought American.
You know, I bet you could've gotten
a Ted Williams original for what you spent.
I don't know that artist.
He drove a home run 502 feet into
the bleachers at Fenway.
You put that ball on display,
you'd have grown men weeping.
Ohh! It's too bad we have a case.
I could stare at this for hours.
Me too.
Don't touch.
I hate taggers.
That's not tagging. It's graffiti.
Same thing.
No, it is not.
Wow. What a powerful piece of street art.
What a powerful example of felony vandalism.
Jane, this is contemporary art.
Says the woman who paid $50,000
for old Pinto parts.
Banksy's street art starts at $100,000.
You don't know who that is.
Yes, I do. He's an urban artist.
And I wouldn't pay for his old Pinto parts, either.
Frankie?
Yeah?
Come take photos of all this vandalism
for the graffiti task force, all right?
You got it.
He a witness?
Says he was working late in his gallery, heard some yelling.
I just thought it was a couple of homeless vets,
you know, squabbling over a shopping cart.
Why were you working late?
I'm preparing for a big showing of my art.
Oh. Detective Rizzoli would want to attend that.
She's a budding art enthusiast.
For real?
For not real.
Wh-- go help Korsak.
We just saw this in a different medium.
You've seen my work?
So, you're admitting to felony vandalism?
No. I did not put those...posters up.
We catch you defacing property,
You won't have another art show, okay, pal?
Survived Fallujah to die in the streets of Boston.
Victim is Bernard Avery, 29.
He's still warm. Rigor hasn't presented.
Some nasty wounds.
Vultures go through his stuff already?
Sad.
We've got about 300 homeless vets on the streets of Boston.
Sharp-force trauma --
chop wounds, puncture wounds.
Well, hey, look at you. Bold.
You ready to call the weapons?
You thinking two weapons?
Maybe two killers.
No, there's only one set of shoe impressions.
Right.
Those couldn't possibly be bloody footprints.
Rondo!
Yo! Vanilla! Over here!
Come on, man! Let me go.
Rondo! Come back here!
I got a tip on your murder,
but your 5-0 bro trying to act like we ain't even family here!
What's up?
This better be good, Rondo.
You are gonna want to promote me to homicide, Vanilla.
One of my C.I.s knows who the killer is.
Wh-- how many you got?
As many as you need, baby.
Yo, Justin.
General Rondo.
Perimeter's clear, my man.
"General"?
You sure she's not taliban, sir?
You can trust her. She works for me.
Don't you, private?
Wh--
Work with me, Vanilla.
Yes.
General Rondo here
tells me that you can I.D. The killer?
Lance corporal Justin Brown, ma'am.
Yes, I can.
Sergeant Avery was K.I.A.'d
by an insurgent dressed in force recon.
Take this.
It contains classified intel.
Really?
I'm telling you -- he saw something.
The kid was a marine special ops.
I got you, my man.
Your intel is safe with me.
Man, homicide's hard-up.
Economy's getting to you, too, huh, Vanilla?
You know what?
When you bring me a real witness,
I'll bring you some real money.
Centimeter and a half deep.
Help me turn him over.
So, let's see.
Stab wounds, bruises, gashes --
that could be three different weapons.
Not necessarily.
The bruises here were likely caused by a rounded instrument.
Yeah, that could be from the handle of a hammer.
The stab wounds could be from the claw,
but it doesn't explain these massive gashes.
The gashes are consistent with a cleaver.
Or an...ax.
Maura...
What if the murder weapon had an ax on one side
and, like, a narrow spike on the other?
What does that look like? Does that look like a tomahawk to you?
Well, there hasn't been a murder in Boston by tomahawk
since the Pequot tribe attacked the colonists.
Yeah, but our victim is a vet. He's a marine.
They issue tactical tomahawks to marines.
Would that explain these injuries?
Got a fresh one for you, Dr. Isles.
Guy collapsed in a cab on his way to Logan.
EMTs pronounced him.
Put him on this table. Thank you.
Dennis Rockmond, 37.
Ooh. Kind of hot -- for a dead guy.
Maura.
Maura!
What?
His penis has a pulse.
Oh, my go-- he's alive!
He has obstruction in his airway,
it might be a bronchospasm. Where are the EMTs?!
How far away are you?
Five minutes. Maura, do something.
Look, someone needs to perform a cricothyrotomy.
Oh. What about you?
You're here. You could do it.
Find me a slender tube.
Where?
In the drawer.
You have a lot of drawers.
Any tube that can create an airway -- a-a straw.
Straw. You want a milkshake?
I need a tube!
Okay! Okay! Um, okay.
Pen. I got it! I got a pen!
Oh, god. I hate working on live people.
What if I kill him again?
Maura, just do it.
Okay.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Maura, look. I think you did it.
You're okay. You're alive.
2 milligrams salbutamol. He's having bronchospasms.
Well, that was exciting.
You think we should bump fists?
It is nice to save someone that handsome.
Wha-- really?
So if he was ugly, you would have let him die?
Of course not.
Listen, get to work on this other dead guy, okay?
Oh, Maura, check his pulse first.
Well, I think our murder weapon may be a tactical tomahawk.
We had them in 'Nam.
To cut through the jungle?
Pshh. To cut through people.
Maybe our victim had a tomahawk.
The military started reissuing them in 2004.
Well, let's check his records.
Hey, I heard you and dr. Isles brought a zombie back to life.
How'd you know?
News like that travels.
Yeah -- hard and fast.
Does the fascination with your ding-a-lings ever end?
Nope.
Nope.
I hope we're not looking at a vet-on-vet murder.
Here's Bernard's military record.
It's clean. Right there --
three combat tours, honorably discharged.
Any arrests since he's been back?
Trespassing, couple of street fights,
public drinking, and disorderly.
No convictions, though.
We got any pictures of his marine squad?
Yeah.
There he is -- holding his tomahawk.
If he brought it back,
it wasn't in his shopping cart.
Zoom in on the guy on his right.
That looks like Rondo's C.I. Justin.
Lance corporal Justin Brown.
Got his tomahawk strapped on.
Yeah, we got our first suspect. Print that.
Bernard Avery's widow's here to see you guys.
Korsak, come on.
Come on, Frankie. Come help me pick up a murder suspect.
Do you recognize any of the other men
in your husband's squad?
That's Justin...
His best friend.
A lot of his squad was from home.
Makes it harder if you have to...
see them die.
Is that what happened on the third tour?
They were on patrol.
They only had a week left.
There was a suicide bomber who blew himself up.
A lot of them died.
I'm sorry.
When Bernard came home, he barely spoke,
except to Justin.
He tried to get a job,
but he was diagnosed with PTSD.
Was he treated for it?
A friend from my wives support group
told me about this outreach center.
Did it help?
It seemed like it.
But he was kicked out after a couple weeks.
Did your husband come back with any weapons?
A tomahawk.
Is that what killed him?
Maybe.
I begged him to get rid of it.
It scared me, it scared our son.
But he said he didn't feel safe without it.
When did your husband become homeless?
About six months ago, after one of his nightmares.
He thought that there was a suicide bomber in the house.
He was looking for his sniper rifle.
He said he had to kill him.
Kill who?
Ki--
kill our son.
I knew I could lose him over there.
I never thought I'd lose him when he finally came home.
I didn't know you lost friends in Vietnam.
I don't like to talk about it. People don't like to hear it.
What happened when you approached the checkpoint?
An I.E.D. went off -- right in front of the humvee.
My sergeant's hit.
Virtual-reality therapy.
We're taking fire.
It feels too real.
But it isn't, Marlon.
What you're seeing is a virtual simulation,
and this is Rob's experience in Iraq.
It's not yours. Yours will be different.
Dude, it's bad at first, but it gets a lot easier.
I don't know.
Look, confronting your fears --
Rob, why don't you take Marlon and go grab a cup of coffee?
I'm Dr. Bacal.
How can I help you?
Uh, Boston homicide.
We'd like to ask you
some questions about Bernard Avery.
Please don't tell me
Bernard's been involved in a homicide.
Actually, he is the homicide.
We found him hacked to death in an alley this morning.
What can you tell us about him?
Um, not much.
I, uh, I tried to work with him,
but he was suspicious about psychologists.
I had one of our vets,
a lieutenant colonel, work with him, as well.
Uh, can we speak with him, please?
Sure.
Come in.
Colonel, I have two detectives here
to talk about Bernard Avery.
Sure.
Colonel Jones! How are you, sir?
No complaints.
Except I've got a sprained ankle. You mind if I sit?
No, please.
Hello, Jane.
Hello, colonel.
Uh, we're here, uh...
Investigating the murder of Bernard Avery.
Well, damn.
What happened?
Why was he kicked out of this program?
We had no choice.
We, uh, we had a new patient
a marine from Bernard's unit.
They got into a physical fight over something that happened in Fallujah.
I had to ask them both to leave.
Was his name Justin Brown?
No.
His name is Tyler Moore
lives at the vet center.
Thank you, colonel. Appreciate the help.
Anytime.
Um, can you... can you give me a minute?
Sure. I'll pull the car around.
What the hell, Casey?
Jane-
How long have you been back?
A few months.
And -- and you did--
you couldn't --
I've been really busy with the veterans center and the...
Oh. No.
'cause the last time that we talked...
I told you I was on a covert assignment,
wasn't allowed to tell you where I was sent.
Operation south Boston?
It's a little complicated.
Try me.
Things have changed, Jane.
But it's good to see you.
Can you close the door on your way out?
Yes, it's good to see you, too.
The cute boy with the erection
is being discharged from the hospital.
He sent me these orchids.
Good. I wish him and his wang a speedy recovery.
What's the matter?
I saw Casey.
What? Where? When?
H-he's back...in Boston.
Actually -- actually, he's been here for a while.
Jane, I'm so sorry.
Oh, my god.
Did you like him more than Dean?
You did, didn't you?
I've been waiting for him to get back from Afghanistan, and...
and he did.
What did he say?
"Good to see you."
Uh-oh. That's bad.
Maura.
You want a real "Ow"?
Wait till your zombie says, "Oh, I'm really busy."
Maybe that's him.
It's Korsak.
He has our suspect in interroga--
I can't focus.
Go interrogate.
Studies show that the best antidote for heartbreak
is distraction.
Okay.
The only reason that I'm going is because if I don't,
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
curled up in the fetal position on your couch.
And your couch blows.
Hello, Tyler.
Private first class Tyler Moore, United States marine corps.
Semper fi.
I didn't kill Bernard.
Tyler, you're not a suspect,
but we would like to know why there was bad blood between you.
It's 'cause of what he did.
Or didn't do.
What didn't he do?
We were on patrol.
Bernard was covering our advance.
He saw the suicide bomber coming right toward us.
He didn't take the shot.
Is that what put you in that chair?
Yeah.
Killed six guys.
And Bernard came home without a scratch.
And if I wasn't in this chair, I would've killed him.
What about Justin Brown?
Does he feel the same way?
Justin's brains were scrambled.
They were buddies.
I hope they both go to hell.
It won't make the pain go away, Tyler.
Excuse me.
What's up, Frost?
We found Justin.
Is he still saying that Bernard was murdered by insurgents?
He's not saying anything, Jane.
He's dead.
Justin's injuries are similar to Bernard's.
So they were both killed with a tactical tomahawk.
You're fixated on Casey.
Why don't you just talk to him?
I would rather juggle your scalpels.
Don't you want to know?
Oh, I know -- it's over.
The University of Missouri researchers do say
that men avoid intimate conversations, anyway.
Really? What a surprising outcome.
He doesn't deserve you, Jane.
Can you please distract me
with some sort of scientific mumbo jumbo?
You see the scarring in Bernard's lungs?
I'm doing more testing, but it could be war lung.
We're seeing it in a lot of soldiers.
Think of all the sad things we'd avoid
if men would just talk about their problems
instead of going to war.
Here are Justin's lungs.
Huh. No sign of war lung.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
They served together,
so they'd be exposed to the same toxins.
Shouldn't they both have it?
Yeah.
Our medical miracle is here to thank us.
Come on.
Ugh. I'm keeping my distance. I'm afraid of that erection.
He's a little sexier alive.
Hello. I'm Dr. Isles.
I remember you.
Are you checking his pulse?
Thank you for saving my life.
And you, too, detective. - Ye-- - no.
I'm...not a hugger.
Oh. Okay.
Well, this is for you.
Thank you.
Well, I heard what you did for me with that pen.
Quick recovery. How's your throat?
It's a little sore. Otherwise, I feel great.
How did you get a Gia Dupont?
Why? Are you shocked
to see such a contemporary masterpiece
in a lowly police station?
No.
You should be, because I'd like to dismantle it for parts.
Official police business coming through.
Uh, excuse me.
Damn shame about Justin.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Rondo.
Who's this?
Oh, this is Sour Grapes, another one of my C.I.s.
We go way back.
I played the blues with this dude.
He could sing the panties right off ya.
Boston's Barry White right here.
That was another life.
Hey, hey. You're Raymond Washington.
Oh, my god, Jane.
It's true about the panties.
Ma.
Your father and I used to go see him
all the time at the Beehive.
Tommy was conceived when --
No, I think it was Frankie.
Ma.
Could we get these gentlemen some coffee?
Sure -- coffee.
I'd prefer a glass of shiraz and a doughnut.
Delish.
Rondo, are you checking out my mother's --
I see the apple bottom doesn't fall far from the Rizzoli tree.
Stop.
Okay.
What did you see?
He killed Justin.
Who?
Pope John Paul. Think it's the second one.
You understand that "C.I." does not mean "crazy individual"?
It stands for "confidential informant,"
which means he provides information to solve a homicide.
But there's something here, Vanilla.
I-I just don't know what it is.
Okay.
So, you're saying the man you saw looked like the Pope?
No, I'm saying he is the Pope,
cruising around in his popemobile...
taking out homeless folks.
It's nice to meet you, Grapes.
Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait! T-that's it.
There's this white dude --
self-appointed sheriff of homeless town.
He reminds me of that Pope, too.
Okay. Okay. I'll check it out.
Check this out, too.
I got me a gut feeling it means something.
Justin's intel.
I'll check it out
If you promise to sing for me one day, Barry White.
No. No, no. I am not making that promise.
Okay, well, give it to me. I'll look into it.
Okay?
Thank you, Rondo.
It's beautiful.
Who's the artist?
Um...me.
I call it "The healing hand."
Seems fitting to give it to you.
Thank you.
Sculpting's just a hobby.
I actually talk for a living.
Oh, I-I-I know --
"Unleash your inner real winning self."
I, um... I googled you.
Well, then I guess you know I was heading to
Akron for a speaking engagement before all this.
Your vocal folds are only temporarily inflamed.
You likely had too much Inderal.
Wait. How did you find that on google?
Well, I-I-I had to look at your, you know, medical records,
uh, you know, just to, uh... just fill out your paperwork,
so...
Do you have plans tonight?
Can I buy you dinner?
If you promise not to die on me again.
That's a deal.
Okay.
So, seven o'clock?
Yeah. I'll see you then.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh. Excuse me.
Angela.
Who was that?
Look what I made --
Cannoncini alla crema pasticcera.
Yum.
I wish Jane could meet a tall drink of water like that.
Maybe if she learned how to make puff pastry...
Oh. I know.
Especially after what happened with Casey.
Start talking.
Hey, we know any neighborhood watch guys
that look like the pope?
Benedict?
No, John Paul II.
I got a witness who says
he saw our suspect rousting homeless guys.
We have all the neighborhood watch volunteers on file.
Let's look.
Can you do a split-screen of a picture of that guy
and one of the pope?
Jeff Miller.
See what he drives.
Pulling his dmv record.
Drives a white dodge van with a bubble-top sunroof.
Your witness say that the bad guy drove the popemobile, too?
Why, yes, he did.
Maybe Jeff Miller went from volunteer to vigilante.
All this reminds me of an agora.
An ancient greek marketplace.
Not many people know that.
I bet you the Greeks didn't have chili dogs like these.
These are the best in Boston.
You know, hot dogs are made from the gonads,
intestines, and eyeballs of hooved animals.
Well... they're still amazing.
Okay, fine.
Let's take a look at the art first.
I'm sorry.
No.
What an exceptional piece.
And you have exceptional hands.
I would love to sculpt them.
What's the wildest,
most outrageous thing you've ever done?
I...
I rode nude on a horse at an equine dressage event.
Well, I was protesting budget cuts
to my college equestrian team.
Come on.
I think it's time for you to do something outrageous again.
What?
That's impressive.
Come on.
What a beautiful view of the city.
Hey, be my lookout.
Wha--
No. No, you -- you can't do that.
That's illegal.
Art is not a crime.
Come on. Take a walk on the wild side.
It's not like we're killing anyone.
All right.
Take that.
Uh...no, no, no. I-I-I can't do that.
I-I am the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Well, tonight, you are a street artist.
Drop the can!
Hands on top of your head. Turn around slowly.
Uh-oh. That's not good.
Oh, you have no idea.
"Get the human trash off our streets."
I think we found Mr. Neighborhood watch.
Piece of scum!
You leave my people alone.
Keep your jackets on, guys. I got this.
"Hyah" to you, too, dirtbag.
Okay, step back, Sir.
Take this homeless sack of junk to jail.
You okay?
Can't even feel it.
Where were you two nights ago?
I was doing your job --
chasing down scum with citizen crime fighters.
They'll vouch for me.
If you think you're gonna pin these homeless murders on me,
then you guys got another think coming.
Okay, so we start with an arrest
for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
What dangerous weapon?
That leg is damn dangerous.
Thank you.
You look nice.
Thank you.
So, your heart's on the mend, I guess?
Oh, my go-- Maura told you about Casey.
I can't believe Charles would treat you like that.
Ma.
I wish you would confide in me.
I-I'm right here.
Really?
Really.
I'm thinking of becoming a nun.
Aw, baby.
Why would you tell my mother about Casey?
Sorry. Jane, look!
Oh, okay.
No problem. Not mad.
Why don't you tell her I got a vibrator, too?
Frankie wrote you up for vandalism?
Maura, you were tagging?
I was with Dennis.
Never date a zombie. They have no respect for the law.
Jane, I have a confession.
I liked it.
I liked it. I liked breaking the law.
It made me feel like who I used to be --
someone who took chances.
Someone who commits felonies and can't keep her mouth shut.
That's great.
I just said I was sorry.
Sorry to interrupt.
Oh, that's okay -- we're just discussing
the case of the lovesick, blabbermouth tagger.
You have the results from Bernard Avery's lung biopsy?
Yes. It wasn't war lung.
Toluene, acetone, propane, and butane.
Was he huffing?
No. It's spray paint.
He was exposed to a lot of it
over the course of months -- maybe years.
You think Bernard was a tagger?
Maybe that's why he was in the alley.
This is a street beef.
Is that a food truck?
Bernard was spray-painting over another tagger's.
And he always had his tomahawk with him.
Well, I wish that I could help you solve these murders,
But, um... I'll be in jail.
Give me that.
Use a tomahawk on my brother.
It could be a rival tagger, right?
Yeah.
These are all the graffiti photos
Frankie took at the crime scene.
"Ra nad om."
You think Yogis are tagging now?
It's "Random," Bro. It says "Random."
"Random." Huh.
Frankie. Get in here.
Ooh! Am I in trouble?
Yes.
You're charging the chief medical examiner with tagging?
Okay, can you two turn your heads, please?
I need to "Hyah" my brother.
It's bogus. My sergeant was there.
I wrote it up to get her and her...boyfriend
the hell off the street.
Meant to tell her. Sorry.
I'll tell her.
Keep seeing this one over and over -- "Penance."
There's no match in the graffiti task force database.
And this one, too -- "Blister."
"Dizzy monocles."
"Dizzy monkey," Dude. Can't you read?
Not graffiti.
"Blister's" name is Steve Bogart.
He was a tagger.
Now he's a documentary filmmaker.
Been shooting Boston's graffiti scene
for the last year.
We ever pick him up?
Doesn't look like it.
Wait. This is interesting.
He's listed on a police report as a victim
of assault and battery.
Look who the assailant was -- Bernard Avery.
How did we miss that?
We ran Bernard's record.
Bernard wasn't charged.
Steve Bogart refused to prosecute.
Maybe because he wanted to handle it himself --
with a tomahawk.
Maybe. I'll get a warrant. We'll go pick him up.
Let's do this.
Watch yourself.
Even with a warrant?
Yeah, when he swings that tomahawk at your head,
just hold up that piece of paper.
I hate these loft apartments.
Clear!
Clear!
They weren't just looking for something.
They broke all his equipment.
You hear that?
Yeah.
It's coming from over there.
Frankie!
Frankie, let's wait for the hazmat team!
Must have...
snuck up and clunked him over the head.
Didn't even get to drink his beer.
Does it look like Steve Bogart?
Looks kind of like corned beef and cabbage.
I love Humboldt Fog.
I'm so glad that you're not mad at me
for getting you into trouble.
Well, Jane is looking into it for us.
I'm hoping that we can do community service.
Ah, I wouldn't worry.
I know several prominent defense attorneys.
I hope that's not necessary.
Um, I-I can turn the air on if it's warm in here.
Oh. No, it's fine.
You really do have good circulation.
I'm sorry. I hope I'm... not making you uncomfortable.
I just thought that since I'm asking you to be nude that,
you know... I should be, too.
Pablo Picasso did say, "Art is dangerous."
Why not?
We're going to jail anyway.
The skull has gaping wounds --
likely produced from the blade of a heavy weapon.
Could it be...from -- oh, I don't know -- a tomahawk?
Just a wild guess.
Well, perhaps I could confirm the weapon
if you told me what my future wardrobe is --
forest-green jumpsuit for my prison stay
or the fluorescent orange
for my court-mandated trash-collecting?
Does the zombie want to know, too?
Oh. I forgot to tell you -- he sculpts in the nude.
I want to hear everything.
A-after we catch the tomahawk killer. Focus.
I can't concentrate.
The thought of my impending incarceration --
Stop!
Okay, you're right. You're right.
Martha Stewart flourished in jail.
But she was in a minimum-security prison.
Where do taggers go?
Can you please just tell me if the wounds on Steve Bogart
are from the same weapon that killed Justin and Bernard?
Let me guess -- he smells?
Yes!
I really am preoccupied. Don't you smell it?
It's acetic acid.
Cool?
Well, it is, because it tells me
he was killed more than 72 hours ago.
What -- three days ago?
Wait, so, Steve here was killed before Justin and Bernard?
Oop! I forgot something.
The summons that Frankie wrote you was a fake.
You can wear your McQueen on your next date with the zombie.
Oh, my god. I'm so relieved.
I can feel my cortisol level dropping.
Wait!
W-why did you let me suffer?
Trying to scare you straight.
I will never tag again.
Just don't gossip with my mother.
That, too.
The killer was looking for something.
Maybe Bogart caught something on tape.
Yeah, but what? He didn't catch either murder on tape.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was already cooking in his jacuzzi
when Bernard and Justin were whacked.
What are you doing with this busted-up keyboard here?
It was Justin's. Let me see it.
He said it contained "classified intel."
Bernard trusted him. Maybe...
Maybe the killer was looking for this.
See what's on it.
Thanks.
Canvases are selling for $25k each.
They'll be worth triple that
once my posters have been mass-marketed.
You'll have to wait in line.
I think it's time we told this fancy crowd
who this talented artist is.
They know. It's me.
Go ahead, Frost!
Why do you paint that boy?
What is this?
Steve Bogart's last documentary.
To give him peace.
You know how they make an 8-year-old boy
a suicide bomber?
They tell him that the infidels will die
but he won't.
He was staring right at me when his face blew apart.
So calm.
That's why he was so haunted.
He couldn't kill that little boy.
You've depicted that pain in your art.
It's not art!
And you can tell that guy that he can't have it!
You can't have it! It's not for sale!
I let my friends die.
Stop recording.
Stop recording!
Look, give me the video card!
Give me -- give me the video card!
Justin, take it --
You couldn't break through as an artist.
You didn't have the talent.
But Bernard did.
He just showed up,
started painting million-dollar art in your alley.
You're crazy.
Triple homicide -- that's crazy.
You killed Steve Bogart
because he had footage of Bernard painting.
Bernard didn't want your money.
You had to kill him to get these canvases.
They were in his shopping cart, right?
And you killed Justin because he was a witness.
You can't prove anything!
Oh, I think we can.
Note to self -- always get rid of the murder weapon.
You're gonna be famous after all.
Cuff him.
Come on.
Thank you.
I've been having this conversation in my head for a long time.
Jane, it's not a good time to talk.
No, I-I understand that it's not a good time to talk
when you're 6,000 miles away and people are shooting at you.
But you came home, and you didn't tell me.
And I don't understand why.
I don't want to have this conversation.
Casey, you and I have been friends since high school.
And then, w-when we saw each other again,
I wasn't some goofy freshman
and -- and you weren't Mr. Big Man on campus anymore.
We -- we were just people.
Two people that had -- had been through some bad things.
I-I fell in love with you.
Jane, please.
And I know you did.
I know it.
Because they sent you to some godforsaken, war-torn desert,
and you kept calling me to hear my voice.
And then I stopped, didn't I?
I have your phone number.
If I'd wanted to see you, I --
If I had anything to offer you, I would have reached out.
But I didn't, and I don't.
The only people in my life I have room for
are these wounded vets.
I'm sorry, Jane.
I'm sorry, too.
You're a fool.
Well, that was a great idea.
He said I was the girl of his dreams.
Maybe it's just too hard for him
to be in a relationship right now.
Yeah -- with me, ever.
Jane, I'm so sorry.
Let's go do something crazy.
You feel like tagging?
No.
God, no. Not that crazy.
So, you mean like
"Graham crackers and canned frosting" crazy?
And a box of shiraz.
It's a little too peppery and full-bodied --
Work with me.
Okay.
