we have new evidence in the dilaurentis case ,
and we need you to come in for a blood sample .
my blood is not on your evidence .
then why do you look so scared ?
i spoke to your father this morning .
you &apos;re seeing him ?
we made lunch plans . i guess i have you to thank for that .
jason .
move over !
why ?
because this never happened .
we found your vehicle near the scene of an accident .
we &apos;ve been here all night , detective .
i picked her up after work today .
is this yours ? there &apos;s still something in it .
i told the doctor how little i had to drink ,
and he wanted to do a tox screen--
there were traces of milizopam in my system .
a code ?
it &apos;s this stupid thing she made back when we were friends .
&quot; maya &apos;s away , sleeping sweet ...
until garrett &apos;s all rosy , count on me . &quot;
&quot; mas sugar &quot; ?
i don &apos;t suppose crazy slipped you the password as well .
mona &apos;s trying to help us .
why else would she give us this ?
emily &apos;s still on the phone .
she seemed to take it okay , didn &apos;t she ?
what , like we should be used to
hearing from ghosts by now ?
spencer , why can &apos;t you admit that she trying to help us ?
hanna , did you ever stop to think why mona would want to help us ?
because she &apos;s afraid of something--
just like we were afraid of her .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , you don &apos;t know .
but the cops are still after my blood .
i told you , my mom will handle that .
i hate needles .
okay , look--
whether this if fake or not ,
we &apos;ve got to figure out what &apos;s on that site .
it was nate .
what did he want ?
i promised to hike up with him to the old boat house .
told him it was maya &apos;s favorite spot in rosewood .
you &apos;re not ... gonna , like , tell him about this , are you ?
if i did that , i &apos;d have to tell him
how we know about it .
em , what do you ... want us to do about this ?
do you mind if we try and break into maya &apos;s site ?
we have to .
okay . um , well ,
how do we get past the password ?
it &apos;s just a password-- there are ways of cracking it .
请重新输入
thought i had an idea of what it was .
guess i don &apos;t know her as well as i thought i did .
it &apos;s okay .
will you be home for dinner ?
yeah .
well , mike &apos;s got a game , we &apos;ll be back by six .
if you could start the salad ...
i can do that .
good .
meredith got the job .
the job at rosewood high .
yes .
are you gonna be okay with that ?
well , who gets to tell mom ?
i will tell your mother .
i gotta go .
home by six ?
i &apos;ll start the salad .
i taught her how to make these little origami boats .
we &apos;d come out here at night with paper and birthday candles ,
make them by the dozens ...
then light the candles and watch them float away .
we used to do the same thing .
with ... paper balloons .
air , water , fire--
maya liked all the elements .
you see her all the time , don &apos;t you ?
almost .
in this place it &apos;s really strong .
your friend jenna stood me up .
i &apos;m sorry .
gave her a day to call and explain ,
then i called her .
what did she say ?
she said she was sorry , but a situation came up .
sounded like she thought she was through with someone ,
but she wasn &apos;t .
that happens .
weren &apos;t you scared to come out here at night ?
i wasn &apos;t alone-- i was with maya .
i never understood how somebody could do that--
kill somebody .
then i saw garret in the hospital ...
and i realized ...
yeah ... i could kill that guy--
kill him with my bare hands .
it wouldn &apos;t change anything .
he &apos;d be dead . it &apos;s a pretty big change .
don &apos;t talk like that , not here . okay ?
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
you didn &apos;t .
good .
i wouldn &apos;t want you to be afraid of me .
okay , marine , drop and give me twenty !
hello .
hello .
aria , come in and meet my ... mother .
hi .
it &apos;s such a pleasure to meet you , mrs. fitz .
&quot; fitzgerald . &quot;
ezra likes to truncate the name for some reason .
but call me diane .
diane .
i &apos;m aria .
yes , you are .
i &apos;m so glad to finally meet
the mysterious girl with the lyrical name .
mysterious ?
well , elusive .
ezra &apos;s kept you to himself all this time ,
i didn &apos;t want to pass up this opportunity .
there &apos;s a benefit at the osgood museum ,
and my mother is honorary trail boss .
oh , that &apos;s great .
yes , it is .
there &apos;s a reception tomorrow night at the museum .
i &apos;d love it if you both could come .
that &apos;s kind of short notice , mom .
indulge me .
i love the osgood .
the women have you outnumbered .
okay .
perfect .
i &apos;ll leave an invitation at the desk . so glad i caught you .
oh , do you have to go ? we can have some coffee .
actually , we &apos;ve got that thing . do you remember ?
right . i completely forgot about that .
i don &apos;t want to disturb your sunday . we &apos;ll talk tomorrow night .
well , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
you too .
i will see you tomorrow night .
yeah . bye .
&quot; fitzgerald , &quot; huh ?
if you want to be a writer ,
you don &apos;t want an albatross like that around your neck .
right . and what if your last name was hemingway ?
then i would be ezra hem .
sounds like you &apos;re clearing your throat .
you know , you don &apos;t have to go
to this thing tomorrow night if you don &apos;t want to .
are you kidding ? i do .
i mean , the osgood and your mom ?
did you notice how she never sat down ?
i noticed her diamonds .
well , in the divorce she got custody the jewelry .
what does she know about us ?
well ... she knows that i love you .
that &apos;s a good start . what else ?
i told her that we didn &apos;t start seeing each other
until after i left rosewood high .
you lied to your mother .
wasn &apos;t the first time .
i thought you said you can crack it .
i can , okay ?
i just have not done it yet .
none of the regular work @-@ arounds are working .
so when do you give up ?
that is completely the wrong attitude .
spencer , we have to know what &apos;s on this .
okay , but it &apos;s not a pinata .
i can &apos;t just whack at it with a stick !
okay , i think that i need help .
what kind of help ?
i @-@ i heard that caleb was back from california .
i haven &apos;t seen him , but ... yeah , i know he &apos;s back .
he wouldn &apos;t even have to know what this was for .
i could just ask him for
some tips on how to get around a tough password .
yeah . you know what , go ahead .
at least one of us might be able to be in the same room as him .
okay . i &apos;ll talk to him tomorrow at school .
do you know where he is ?
hey , toby .
hanna .
where ... who is ?
jason .
um , can you ... wait upstairs ?
we &apos;ll be finished in a couple minutes .
yeah .
what do you mean , &quot; where is he ? &quot;
i mean , i was just at his house and he &apos;s gone .
the house is locked , his car isn &apos;t in the garage .
so maybe he &apos;s just out .
he &apos;s not driving around with a busted @-@ up front end .
that car is evidence . he &apos;s not out , he &apos;s gone .
across the state line , paying cash to fix his car .
you covered for him , i covered for you ,
and you left us both lying to the cops .
i was just trying to protect him .
i think that you &apos;re the one that needs protection .
he &apos;s my brother , toby .
and the people you really need protecting from
are the ones you &apos;re related to .
before you talk to him , you &apos;re gonna listen to me .
toby , please ...
i &apos;m not gonna ask you to explain anything ,
because you won &apos;t ... you just say that i have to trust you .
mona &apos;s locked up , garrett is locked up ...
but you still jump every time your phone rings .
it &apos;s ...
i know , it &apos;s &quot; complicated . &quot;
so i &apos;ll make easy on you-- i &apos;ll find out for myself .
toby , please ...
hey . i rang the doorbell .
my folks are in scranton .
haven &apos;t seen you at school .
i missed a few days .
are you okay ?
i felt pretty bad for a while ,
but i &apos;m better now .
okay , we have to talk about this .
no . we don &apos;t .
you got sick because you drank from my flask .
i have to explain what that happened ,
or at least try to explain .
we can forget about the whole thing . honestly , em .
you deserve to know the truth .
can we go someplace and talk ?
i can &apos;t today .
tomorrow ? after school ?
please .
okay .
okay .
so what couldn &apos;t you tell me over the phone ?
frankly , i shouldn &apos;t be telling you anything at all ,
you &apos;re not immediate family .
but i know how invested you are in mona .
did something happen to her ?
not yet .
but they &apos;re gonna move her to a different facility .
where ?
near saratoga . in new york .
no , they can &apos;t !
her attending physicians think
she needs a more intense treatment program .
frankly , i think they &apos;re worried about
liability more than mona &apos;s health .
they want her under high security .
why ?
for one , mona &apos;s outburst in the day room ,
and they realize she hasn &apos;t been taking all her meds .
they think she &apos;s been smuggling
them out with a visitor .
what visitor ?
not you .
but mona &apos;s surprisingly popular .
they can &apos;t send her away . what about her parents ?
they &apos;re still in denial .
they &apos;ll go along with whatever the board recommends .
well , talk the board out of it !
what ?
talk them out of moving her .
tell them in your expert opinion you think
she &apos;s gonna get much better right here in rosewood .
my expert opinion might not mean much .
these are the men who wrote the textbooks .
i don &apos;t care about the books .
i can &apos;t promise anything , but i &apos;ll talk to them .
you can do it .
your confidence in me is bracing .
essentially misplaced , but bracing .
excuse me .
this is very impressive .
my mom doesn &apos;t use it much since the accident ,
so she let me take it .
you drove it back from california ?
i have a lot of thinking to do .
driving helps .
yeah . i get it .
um , listen , i have sort of an abstract computer question .
i was wondering if you could help me out with it .
what &apos;s the question ?
i was wondering what &apos;s the best way to get around
really tough password protection .
that &apos;s about as abstract as a brick wall .
yeah , okay . maybe we are talking about a real password .
&quot; maybe &quot; ?
there &apos;s a particular site that i cannot get onto .
whose site is it ?
what should i wear ?
i have to look insanely sophisticated for this .
how about a ... hello kitty t @-@ shirt ?
help me , please . this is ezra &apos;s mom .
so what &apos;s she like ?
diamonds and chanel on a sunday morning .
i think you &apos;re in spencer territory .
that &apos;s a good idea .
so , ezra &apos;s family has some money .
yeah , his mom does .
what ?
you just said he &apos;s been scrambling for work .
i have been with the boy who gets a fat allowance .
it &apos;s like having the parent on the date with you .
yeah , but if he really needed help ,
don &apos;t you think he &apos;d ask her ?
if it is real ,
i have no idea how mona got it .
but if it &apos;s fake ,
it &apos;s an insanely cruel thing to do to emily .
i know that we &apos;ve asked you to do something like this before ,
so i get it if you don &apos;t--
no , i &apos;ll do it .
look , whatever happened , hanna &apos;s important to me .
so if i have a chance to crush the mona monster ,
i &apos;m in .
after school ?
yeah , after school .
&quot; mona &apos;s almost gone &quot; ?
gone where ?
the doctors at radley want to send her to another hospital--
one with thicker bars .
how do you know that ?
wren told me .
he did ?
what does he have to do with any of this ?
he thought i should know ,
and he said that mona &apos;s been passing her meds to a visitor .
lucas ?
you &apos;re saying that the pills
that aria found in his bag might be for mona ?
i don &apos;t know , wren didn &apos;t tell me , so i didn &apos;t ask .
and &quot; hanna &apos;s next . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to give anyone any of my blood . i need all i got .
my mom is handling it .
wait a second .
if they send mona away ,
we &apos;re not gonna find out why she gave us maya &apos;s site .
if it really is maya &apos;s site .
you &apos;re sure your mom can stop this court order on hanna &apos;s blood ?
my mom picks her teeth with court orders .
what did you want to borrow ?
i want something classy but not frumpy .
not that you have frumpy .
mom ?
spencer , she &apos;s gonna know you went through there .
i can get in and out without leaving a trace .
ooh , jackpot .
garrett &apos;s file ?
yeah . the works .
get out your phone . we &apos;re taking pictures .
paige !
that drug that made you sick--
it didn &apos;t come from anybody at the party . it was in my flask .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
i guess i figured that out .
when i gave it to you , i didn &apos;t know it .
i swear , i would never do that to you .
but somebody did that you .
yeah , somebody did it to me .
who ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you know when it happened ?
it was the night that somebody dug up ali &apos;s grave .
i drank from the flask and i ..
lost time .
i was at spencer &apos;s , and then i wasn &apos;t at spencer &apos;s ,
and i &apos;m trying to find out what happened to me .
you were with me .
part of that night ... you were with me .
maya wasn &apos;t just strangled , her triquetrum was crushed .
by a pipe or a metal bar .
or a policeman &apos;s nightstick .
&quot; lividity indicates the victim was killed at the scene . &quot;
lividity ?
it &apos;s the way blood settles in the body when the heart stops .
it means that maya was killed right there in emily &apos;s backyard .
look at this .
maya was killed the same night that garrett was arrested at my house .
between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.
which means that he had plenty of time
to kill maya and meet with melissa .
poor maya .
she was just out there in the backyard the whole time ?
well , the tenants had moved out ,
and emily hadn &apos;t moved back in .
the house was empty .
says that there was no personal property found at the scene .
so if she had a bag , somebody took it with them .
what &apos;s this ?
the prosecution witness list .
look at that .
bart comstock ?
&quot; break him and it falls apart . &quot;
my mom is gonna go after this guy .
he must know something or have seen something .
yeah , something bad about garrett .
and she thinks that if she can break him , she could win .
the address is in rosewood . do you want to go there ?
caleb &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
i &apos;ll go on my way home .
are you sure ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;m just gonna see what &apos;s there .
you &apos;re not gonna tell caleb about these , are you ?
no . it &apos;s strictly &quot; need to know . &quot;
okay , bye .
it was about eleven o &apos;clock , i think . my folks were out .
i heard something on the front porch .
you were sitting on my steps .
you were drunk . i thought you were drunk .
do you remember me taking you into the house ?
i don &apos;t remember .
i was holding you up .
then i wasn &apos;t holding you--
you were holding me .
you kissed me .
maybe you thought i was someone else ,
i think i knew that , but i didn &apos;t stop you .
i didn &apos;t want to stop you . it was ... like a dream .
and then what happened ?
the dream ended .
i went into the kitchen to get you a glass of water ,
and when i came back you were gone .
i tried to call your phone , but you didn &apos;t answer .
somebody called me at eleven .
then at school , i could tell you didn &apos;t remember .
or you didn &apos;t want to remember .
no , i didn &apos;t remember . i don &apos;t remember !
why wouldn &apos;t you have told me this sooner ?
i convinced myself that what i did was okay . it wasn &apos;t .
you were there , and i just got ... greedy .
it was bad enough when i thought you were drunk ,
but when i found out about the flask ,
i felt ... worse than awful .
please , emily , you have to understand , i didn &apos;t--
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re much more impressed
with my opinion than the board .
i couldn &apos;t say anything to change their minds .
when do they send her away ?
it &apos;s just a matter of paperwork now .
look , hanna , we may have been going about this the wrong way .
i &apos;m not the person to speak to them on mona &apos;s behalf .
you are .
me ?
yeah . you &apos;ve been visiting her for months . you &apos;re her friend .
you want me to talk to a bunch of doctors ?
not the whole board , just her primary physicians .
there &apos;s an advocacy hearing tonight .
explain it to them the way you explained it to me .
no . i can &apos;t talk to them the way i talk to you .
then you better be prepared to say good @-@ bye to mona .
oh . we &apos;re not open .
first show &apos;s at six @-@ thirty .
oh . i was just coming by for
a schedule for the film festival .
sure . yeah .
some ... great stuff comin &apos; up .
lot of that &apos;s not on dvd .
thanks .
it &apos;s funny , i &apos;ve been coming to this theater my whole life ,
and i never thought of it as having an address or a number .
you just say , &quot; i &apos;m going to the movies , &quot;
and everybody knew what you meant .
yeah . like when you say you &apos;re going to church .
yeah , i guess so .
anything else i can help you with ?
i &apos;m usually pretty good figuring out passwords .
that &apos;s because most people don &apos;t want good passwords--
they want passwords they can remember .
passwords keep you from going in the front door .
i like to look for an open window ,
something that allows you to get into the system
and unlock things from the other side .
like a burglar .
that &apos;s the idea .
that &apos;s a nice machine .
your folks ?
my mom .
hmm . new car , new computer ...
she just lent me the car .
okay , she didn &apos;t lend you that sweater .
no , it &apos;s a rental .
what ? do you just want me to admit
that my mom bought me new clothes ?
that not just clothing .
that is $ 400 worth of sweater you have there .
so i should probably wash it on &quot; gentle &quot; then , right ?
no ! you should dry clean it !
if you wash this , you will end up with a sweater for a shih tzu .
i have never been a dry cleaning kind of guy .
that was then , and this is now .
yeah , i know who you &apos;re talking about .
i remember those two girls .
that is a couple you don &apos;t forget .
how &apos;s your friend doing ?
it &apos;s hard .
and the roughest part was that we all had to talk to the police .
yeah . i know . listen , they talked to me .
why would they talk to you ?
well , like i said , i remembered her ,
so that &apos;s how i recognized her .
recognized her where ?
well , it was late , i was up on the marquee changing the bill ,
and i saw her
get in the cop car with the guy who killed her .
maya got into a police car with garrett reynolds ?
yeah , right up the block . the night he killed her .
she probably thought she was safe . i mean ,
how could she know that the cop was crazy ?
just can &apos;t trust anybody .
yeah , that &apos;s for sure .
these are so deadly .
i think i will have my cupboard locked for all the century .
put the pretzel down and cross your fingers .
权限维护 输入新密码
we &apos;re in .
you &apos;re kidding .
&quot; but at my back i always hear
time &apos;s winged chariot hurrying near . &quot;
andy marvel-- what a marvel--
talking to his coy mistress about how they shouldn &apos;t waste any time .
like you &apos;re doing listening to me .
oh , my god . i can not believe that you got us in !
this is where i &apos;m going to put things to keep from losing them .
i &apos;m always losing things .
so this really is maya &apos;s site .
yeah . it is .
if you &apos;re looking at me , beware--
this site is cursed .
it is completely real .
did you find anything ?
yeah , that guy bart comstock ,
he saw maya get into a police car with garrett
the night he killed her .
h @-@ he told you that ?
that &apos;s why your mom wants to squash him .
i &apos;m gonna try emily again .
okay , just ... please let me know when you get ahold of her .
okay .
bye .
look , it &apos;s not too late to ditch this
and find a miniature golf course .
lyle and frances springer .
yeah . my grandparents .
as in springer preservation fund
springer endowment for the arts ?
guilty .
hi .
ezra . all of this stuff belongs to your family ?
yeah .
your family doesn &apos;t have money , your family has money .
look ... i should have figured out a way to tell you about this ,
but it &apos;s kind of hard to work into a conversation .
you were cutting off a lot more than a name
when you went from fitzgerald to fitz .
all this stuff , it used to be in my grandparents &apos; house ,
and the only people that ever saw it were my family
and people they paid to clean up after them .
and they were fine with that . but i &apos;m not .
i just always thought that you never talked about your family
because you didn &apos;t want them knowing about me .
i wasn &apos;t keep you away from my family .
i was keeping my family away from you .
are you angry ?
no ... no , i don &apos;t think so .
but i think that you owe me something for all those ramen noodles .
i think we can negotiate that .
okay .
it &apos;s okay .
sorry . i didn &apos;t think there was anyone here .
i wanted to see what it was like at night .
yesterday was your first time back here since she died ... wasn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
i upset you ... making you come out here .
no . it &apos;s not that .
you sure ?
yeah .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m glad you made me come back .
&quot; made me come back . &quot; that doesn &apos;t sound so good .
i wanted to . you just helped me make up my mind .
all right .
that was yesterday . how about tonight ?
do you think it &apos;s possible to do something
without knowing you &apos;re doing it ?
i mean , without knowing why you &apos;re doing it ?
no .
i think we &apos;re always who we are .
okay , but suppose you were drunk .
people drink to cover up what they want .
it &apos;s like when you do things in a dream
and it frightens you
because you didn &apos;t think that &apos;s who you are .
but it &apos;s you .
even in a dream , it &apos;s still you .
you cold ?
yeah , a little .
thanks .
you looked lonely over here .
oh , i &apos;m fine .
these are amazing .
ezra said that they belonged to your mom and dad .
that &apos;s right .
he hasn &apos;t told you very much about himself , has he ?
well , we &apos;re still learning .
yes .
well , you certainly know about
the dedicated teacher , the struggling writer .
you fit right into that world-- you get to be the muse .
oh , no , i wouldn &apos;t pretend to be that .
don &apos;t diminish yourself . you have a very important role in this .
i just ... i don &apos;t think of myself as playing any role with ezra .
no , i don &apos;t suppose you do .
what do your parents think about ezra ?
well , my mom likes him a lot more than my dad .
fathers and daughters-- that can be tricky .
yeah .
new man coming along to take away daddy &apos;s little girl .
your parents are divorced , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah .
yeah , they are .
recently ?
guess you could say that .
as recently as when you started seeing ezra ?
seeing him ... romantically , i mean .
you ask questions like you already know the answers .
it &apos;s really very easy
to find out what you need to know about people .
oh . all-- all due respect ,
but my family &apos;s not really any of your business .
oh , but it &apos;s such an interesting family .
your brother &apos;s arrest record ,
your romance with a former teacher ,
the way your mother moved out over your father &apos;s infidelity .
you can literally chart all the cracks and strains .
excuse me .
aria .
you act as if i &apos;ve hurt your feelings .
it was unintentional .
i just want to make sure that i &apos;m being clear .
i may not agree with the way ezra lives his life ,
but i &apos;m not gonna stand by and let you ruin him .
i love him .
oh , yes .
it &apos;s all romance and sacrifice in your little paris garret .
except you determine what gets sacrificed , not him .
you &apos;re the one that made it impossible for him
to stay at your little high school .
you &apos;re the one who got him tossed out of hollis .
i want to make sure you understand your own motives .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have any motives .
everyone has motives .
maybe in your world .
it &apos;s not too late for us to have a practical discussion .
there can be real @-@ world compensations in your ending this .
compensations ?
i &apos;ve got your attention at last .
i thought i might .
what did you say to her ?
what did i say to whom ?
i can &apos;t find aria .
oh . is she gone ?
she was talking to you the last time i saw her .
maybe it &apos;s past your bedtime ?
it &apos;s astounding that you can do things like this
and still not understand why i want nothing to do with this family .
i really don &apos;t know what you think i &apos;ve done .
i had a lovely chat with the girl .
i don &apos;t know , maybe she just felt out of place .
you can endow all the museums you want ,
but you &apos;re not fooling anybody .
there &apos;s not a generous bone in your body .
i believe it would be very therapeutic
for mona to stay at radley .
she needs the continuity of clinical environment
so important to fully integrate the socially challenged teen
back into the peer community .
look , mona did some terrible things .
she did some of them to me , and i &apos;m her best friend .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know how she could ,
but i think i understand how angry she was .
mona and i are very , very close , i mean ,
we &apos;re like the same person .
we started out at the same place .
and we were so close to becoming those girls
who would sit at a table and guard purses
while the hot girls were on the floor dancing .
but mona made sure we didn &apos;t disappear ...
and i owe her for that .
look , i see her in that robe and those slippers ,
and i realize that could be me in there .
and if it was me , mona would be sitting here
asking all of you to not send me away .
so please don &apos;t .
don &apos;t send her to saratoga .
she dosen &apos;t know anyone in saratoga .
there will be no one there to hold her hand .
and no one will care a brown rat &apos;s ass for her in saratoga .
so please .

i want you to listen .
i haven &apos;t been with anyone since maya .

or at least i didn &apos;t think i was thinking about it .
i was drunk that night , and i got lost .
only i didn &apos;t really get lost .
i was looking for something .
i was looking for somebody ...
and i came here .

what are you talking about ?
i know that you think he &apos;s wrecking mine ,
but am i just really screwing things up for him ?
am i responsible ?
am i--am i just destroying everything that i touch ?
no . you couldn &apos;t .
you would never hurt anyone .
and no one could ever be harmed by having you in their life .
i screwed up , didn &apos;t i ?
they &apos;re probably gonna send her to mars now .
you did the opposite of screwing up .
based on your testimony , the board has decided
to delay any decision to transfer mona .

she gets to stay .
oh , my god !
i thought you &apos;d be pleased .
i am . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
斯宾塞

we should not be watching this .
stop it .
there are hundreds of videos ,
and you don &apos;t know what they are until you open them .
everything &apos;s jumbled up .
yeah , it &apos;s more of a junk drawer than a journal .
yeah , but this is real .
mona gave us the genuine article .
how ?
why ?
to help us .
how much of this did caleb see ?
he didn &apos;t want to see any of it once he realized what it was ,
but he got us in there .
i think emily &apos;s got a very old soul .
i feel it when i kiss her .
i can hear clocks all over the world running backwards .
i &apos;m so out of my comfort zone .
hanna , don &apos;t
just one more .
i &apos;m such a coward . i know that .
i have to face my fears .
i can &apos;t hide forever .
i can &apos;t keep being afraid .

her phone is off .
well , call her again . now .
we can &apos;t watch this without her .
at least it &apos;s on this time .
just looking at you in that hoodie makes me shiver .
