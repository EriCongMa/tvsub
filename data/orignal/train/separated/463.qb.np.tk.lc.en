the inspired
two women were found in a park
in glendale , arizona .
both of them were left in that prayer position .
our unsub could have shot his victims anywhere ,
but he chose the heart ,
suggesting that he &apos;s been hurt by somebody close to him
who &apos;s clearly the center of his rage .
heather clarke ...
it was announced in the paper she was to be married .
shut up ! you never loved me !
so wallace killed heather ,
and when that didn &apos;t alleviate his rage ,
he began killing other women .
he suffers from an acute delusional disorder .
mom ?
he &apos;s sick .
we &apos;re looking for your son .
what did he do ?
hold on .
get out of the car !
we got the wrong guy .
what ?
the fingerprints at the restaurant don &apos;t match .
let me say it again for the cheap seats .
my client is innocent of these charges .
he &apos;s been wrongfully arrested for crimes he did not commit .
this is a case of the glendale police department ,
and especially the fbi , jumping the gun .
why ? because profiling doesn &apos;t work , people .
racial profiling , behavioral profiling , whatever .
when you rely on a set of assumptions instead of facts ,
you arrest the wrong people .
do we know who the twin is ?
his name is jesse gentry .
garcia &apos;s pulling his information now .
identical twins .
what are the odds ?
about 3.5 per thousand .
well , i asked reid the same question .
you let him go ?
we didn &apos;t have a choice .
he &apos;s a paralegal at a law firm .
jesse called the lead partner
and within minutes the whole firm was here
with employment records .
excuse us .
hey , make it good , mama . we are stuck on our own 20 .
i don &apos;t know if this is the penalty kick you need ,
but here &apos;s what i got jesse gentry .
he was put up for adoption a smidge
before he and his brother turned 3 .
his adoptive parents kept his first name ,
raised him in phoenix ,
and he came to glendale 5 years ago for work .
any contact between him , wallace , and their mother ?
sort of--ellipses-- and about a year ago
he unsealed his adoption record .
so , he knew he had a twin .
he could have inserted himself into the investigation
as a decoy to help his brother out .
hold your handsome horses , boy wonder .
his cell phone is clean , there &apos;s no credit card overlap .
so just looking at the-- pardon the dirty word--metadata ,
he hasn &apos;t had any contact with his family here .
go through all that work and not make contact ? come on .
at this point , everything &apos;s on the table .
dave and i will help coordinate the manhunt for wallace .
reid , you and blake talk to carla hines .
she was the last person to see her son .
jj , you and morgan keep tabs on jesse .
even though he wasn &apos;t part of the original investigation ,
he is now .
agent hotchner ,
his lawyer wants to talk .
if you arrest my client again , lawsuit .
if you harass him , lawsuit .
if you follow him , lawsuit .
if you sneeze in his general direction ,
lawsuit .
your client was arrested as we were closing in on his brother .
you &apos;re telling me that was a coincidence ?
i &apos;m going to &quot; yes , and &quot; you .
yes , and i can prove it in a court of law .
jesse submitted the request last week for a night shift .
i approved the overtime myself .
we &apos;d still like to question him .
which you can submit in writing to me .
look ... i know jesse .
i like him .
you guys made a big boo @-@ boo here .
does he know his brother &apos;s a psychopath
who &apos;s devolving rapidly ?
jesse &apos;s not his brother .
you misunderstand my question .
now that they know that they &apos;re twins ,
one will seek out the other .
and when that happens , will your power of attorney
be enough to protect jesse from wallace ?
just leave him alone .
&quot; we are not only our brother &apos;s keeper ,
in countless large and small ways
we are our brother &apos;s maker . &quot;
bonaro overstreet .
since we can &apos;t surveil jesse ,
we dug deeper into his life .
his adoption was through a local parish .
his adoptive family was stable .
good grades through college and dreams of law school .
hence the job at the firm .
sounds like everything wallace isn &apos;t .
yeah , we thought so , too .
which made us wonder-- why even show up at all ?
especially after choosing not to reach out
to either of them in the past .
he &apos;s got his own agenda .
it &apos;s all conjecture ,
because there &apos;s nothing deviant in this guy &apos;s history .
but if you wanted to do something bad ,
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have another version of you
to blame it on ?
unless we have probable cause ,
we have to leave jesse alone .
we need to focus on wallace .
he &apos;s devolving , right ?
the witnesses at the restaurant said
he was hallucinating and twitching .
he doesn &apos;t have the means or skill
to disappear completely .
he &apos;d run to a place where he feels safe .
i &apos;m thinking his mother &apos;s .
blake and reid have that covered .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i have cross @-@ checked the patterns
of goofus , gallant , and their mother
and i found something interesting .
it turns out that when wallace got in trouble
those couple of times with heather ,
carla would put him on a train to albuquerque ,
presumably to stay with her sister who lives there .
like a bad penny , that wallace ,
he &apos;d get back on a train to glendale ,
only to harass the first time ,
and then to chop up and , you know , ugh .
head to the train station .
if we find the mother , we find wallace .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s the kind of mistake
that can end careers .
so hotch doesn &apos;t get the section chief job .
spencer , jesse gentry is threatening
a multi @-@ million @-@ dollar lawsuit against the bureau .
it &apos;s not just hotch , it could be all of us .
that &apos;s the car wallace stole from the shootout .
this is ssa spencer reid
requesting backup at 505 palmetto street .
fbi !
carla hines !
anybody home ?
clear !
clear .
jewelry &apos;s still in the bedroom . this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
maybe wallace or jesse came for their mother .
maybe , but if either twin did this ,
they &apos;d have a lot of questions .
whoever did this was trying to hide something .
carla ?
let &apos;s see .
it looks like documents from the delivery .
pages from a baby book .
things a mother would keep .
and destroy if she had to .
all the evidence of a 30 @-@ year secret .
except we know about the twins .
they know about each other .
what &apos;s left for her to hide ?
wake up .
you know who i am ?
did our mother ever talk about me ?
no .
why did she keep you ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m jesse .
i &apos;m jesse gentry .
i &apos;m the one she put up for adoption .
what do you want ?
an apology ?
i want answers .
untie me ...
and we &apos;ll talk .
after what they &apos;re charging you with ?
i don &apos;t think so .
where are we ?
a place i dog @-@ sit .
one of the partners at my firm .
she &apos;s out of town .
and the stress from this unfortunate incident
has earned me some time off .
they won &apos;t find us .
what do you want to know ?
i want to know if my life is over .
how bad it &apos;s gonna be when i walk down the street .
i want to know everything you did .
she also tried to destroy a birth certificate .
it still looks like mom was trying to burn everything
that mentioned jesse , right ?
based on what i &apos;m salvaging .
then why didn &apos;t she burn the apgar scores ?
this identifies both twins by name .
how &apos;d she miss this ?
she didn &apos;t .
she burned other sections of the box .
so this isn &apos;t about jesse at all .
she &apos;s trying to hide something else .
if we work deductively
based on what survived and eliminate from that ,
we know her hospital , her o.b. ,
even what drugs she took .
but not who the father is .
so who &apos;s dad ?
you did all that ?
to every one of those women ?
my god .
i don &apos;t care if you don &apos;t understand me .
no one understands me . not even mom .
but i understand .
so wait . while--while we &apos;re sitting here talking ,
are you thinking about--
no .
no .
killing you won &apos;t make me feel any better .
it &apos;s those women .
the way they look at me .
judging me , like ...
i &apos;m a failure .
what &apos;s that ?
there .
just something that i do .
i &apos;ve done it for as long as i can remember .
i went to grade school with this girl .
she used to , uh , pull out her own hair and eat it .
is it like that ?
gross .
you &apos;re judging her ?
all i know is that when i kill ...
or even think about doing it ,
i ...
i feel better .
you don &apos;t need jail .
you need help .
yeah .
who &apos;s gonna help me ?
i am .
for better or worse , we &apos;re related .
which means it &apos;s my job to protect you .
so we &apos;re gonna stay here , until the cops chill out ,
and then ...
we &apos;ll cross the border into canada
where you can get treatment .
i tried that . it didn &apos;t work .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a heavy duty sedative .
it &apos;ll knock you out for 16 hours .
i &apos;m not taking it .
hey , look , we do this my way or we don &apos;t do it at all .
and if we don &apos;t do it , then my next phone call is to the cops .
let me see if you &apos;ve swallowed it .
we have eyes on carla hines . she &apos;s approaching now .
nobody move until we have wallace .
any potential targets in the area ?
negative .
wallace must be late .
she &apos;s not sticking around .
go . go . go .
carla hines ?
i &apos;m with the fbi .
we need to talk .
danny ?
no .
not danny .
why were you at the station ?
i know that you think that if you don &apos;t say anything ,
you can &apos;t incriminate wallace .
but the only way he survives this is if you help us .
i don &apos;t know where he is .
i really don &apos;t .
you can ask me a hundred times and i swear to you ,
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you .
then what else is there to talk about ?
the more i know about wallace ,
the faster we &apos;ll be able to find him .
why did you choose him over jesse ?
when i found out that i was pregnant ,
i was so happy .
but twins ?
twins ?
everybody kept telling me that it was gonna get easier , you know ?
it never did .
i was a single mom . i didn &apos;t have any money .
i didn &apos;t have anyone to help me .
and then when they were two ,
they had this ear infection
that they just passed back and forth for 4 months .
do you have any idea what that &apos;s like ?
well , there was a stomach flu
where my son and i took turns throwing up .
so you get it . you know .
the--the just insanity of knowing that ...
i couldn &apos;t do it all by myself .
and that &apos;s when i decided that i had to let one of them go .
but the morning of the adoption , i ...
i hadn &apos;t decided .
so i went into their nursery ,
and i just stared at them ...
just sleeping ,
perfect .
and then wallace looked up at me
and he said , &quot; i love you , mommy . &quot;
and i knew .
i chose wallace .
why ?
why what ?
why me ?
why him ?
why couldn &apos;t i be the perfect mom
and have the perfect kids like all the other moms ?
why ? i deserve that !
yes , you do .
hey , buddy , how you doing ?
yeah , give me a minute and i &apos;ll take you out , ok ?
good morning .
how long you been up ?
a while .
breakfast is in the bag .
hey , look , i gotta go walk this dog , so--
jesse .
you &apos;re not tying me up again ,
or giving me any more pills .
just go .
i &apos;ll be fine .
i know why you &apos;re doing all this .
really ?
why ?
you want to be like me .
no , i don &apos;t .
then why bring me here ?
why try to understand me ? why care ?
you want to know me so you can be me .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m not gonna leave .
because i want that , too .
i need to ask you something else , carla ,
about the father .
what about him ?
why did you burn all the evidence of him ?
he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s not important .
i think he &apos;s very important .
he was some loser
that i made a mistake of sleeping with in college .
he couldn &apos;t hack being a dad ,
so fine . fine . let him go .
he deserves to have a life .
then when all this ...
started coming out , i didn &apos;t want jesse
or wallace or you knocking on his door .
you stopped believing me just then .
because you &apos;re not telling the truth .
you don &apos;t burn treasured mementos
to make a loser &apos;s life more convenient .
who &apos;s the father ?
you can believe whatever you want .
who &apos;s the father ?
thank you for your cooperation .
wait . so we &apos;re letting her go now ?
she &apos;s holding back , but she won &apos;t break .
we have a better chance of finding wallace through her .
we &apos;ll stick on her like glue .
the meantime , we need to force wallace to make a move .
shouldn &apos;t be hard . he &apos;s devolving .
we just need to get under his skin .
do you think heather &apos;s parents would help us ?
making a move in the second ...
jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base ...
we interrupt our broadcast
to bring you this live press conference .
this is a message to wallace hines .
we know how you felt about our daughter .
and so we are asking you , as parents ,
to turn yourself in .
so please stop hurting other people ,
and turn your--
wallace .
come here .
what is it ?
you hate me , don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t hate you . i love you .
i love you so much ,
i &apos;m gonna eat ... you ... up .
i &apos;m ok , i &apos;m ok , i &apos;m ok !
i &apos;m ok !
jesse !
jesse .
oh , my god , how have you been ?
what ? i--
i didn &apos;t see you at the dog park ,
and then i saw the news and i was like , are you kidding ?
i mean , no offense , but what your brother did ...
it &apos;s crazy . what your brother did ...
it &apos;s crazy .
but you can &apos;t let that bother you , ok ?
you &apos;re not wallace .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t talk to you right now .
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t feel so good .
no problem .
let me know if i can do--
how did we do ?
oh , you did great .
not a lot of parents can stand in front of cameras
and say that .
we just ... thought of heather .
alex .
he &apos;s done it again , hasn &apos;t he ?
excuse me .
wallace &apos;s m.o.--the rape , the bullet through the heart .
he even tried to pose her .
he didn &apos;t try to force @-@ feed her ,
which is his signature .
and this crime scene ...
organized , skilled ,
got in and out without detection .
exactly . if wallace is losing it ,
he wouldn &apos;t be capable of this .
maybe he re @-@ evolved .
or we have a copycat who &apos;s a literal copy .
jesse ? but why start now ?
why this victim ?
mr. randall , what time did you check on your sister ?
this morning .
she didn &apos;t respond to my calls or texts .
it &apos;s not like her .
we &apos;re close .
close in age , right ?
yeah . we &apos;re ...
twins .
you &apos;re fraternal twins .
yeah . how &apos;d you know ?
it was jesse .
jesse , wait !
oh . hey , elizabeth .
i just want to apologize about before .
right . before .
i was thinking about what i said about your brother .
i might have come across a little insensitive .
i tell you what .
why don &apos;t you come on in ,
and we &apos;ll talk about it .
yeah , of course .
all i was trying to say is ,
this is all gonna blow over once they catch the right guy .
i guess .
it &apos;s just ... sometimes ...
it &apos;s hard to tell who the right guy is .
isn &apos;t that right , wallace ?
oh , no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , no .
you were right .
i am like you .
i &apos;ve always been like you .
that &apos;s why you found me , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
and i know this is gonna sound totally weird ,
but i was hoping we could do this one together .
that &apos;s not weird .
it &apos;s not weird at all .
the victim was elizabeth nash .
her car &apos;s missing .
sergeant johnson &apos;s running an apb on it now .
you see it ?
see what ?
sperm clusters , all over .
they raped her together .
shot and posed her postmortem .
signature ?
they cut off her own finger and fed it to her .
well , that could be wallace , it could be jesse ,
it could be both .
one twin &apos;s behavior is inspiring the other &apos;s .
well , we have two psychopaths
who have found the perfect partner in each other .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a partnership , i think it &apos;s a trap .
jesse &apos;s previous victim was a fraternal twin .
i think that &apos;s the surrogate for his real anger .
jesse &apos;s the discarded son .
of course . he &apos;d be furious at his brother .
well , why not just kill wallace ?
i think he &apos;s planning to ,
as soon as he can &apos;t frame wallace
for any more murders .
bad news .
we lost carla .
how ?
she went into a restaurant and disappeared out the back .
there was a car waiting .
she couldn &apos;t have done that without help .
garcia .
i &apos;m ahead of you , sir .
carla &apos;s gone radio silent , but i &apos;m checking her records
to see who she contacted last .
and it is ...
holy shylock .
we &apos;re with the fbi . everyone step away from your computers .
you , you &apos;re gonna write down the wireless pass code for us .
nod your head if you intend to cooperate .
good . you get to keep practicing law today .
where &apos;s mark anderson ?
in there .
agents , i can explain .
you helped carla hines escape .
i can &apos;t comment on that because of attorney @-@ client privilege .
except the fact that she is your client ,
which means she and jesse
know each other and probably have for a while .
i ... it &apos;s complicated .
it &apos;s actually very simple .
we can now prove that jesse is a killer .
which makes you an accessory .
hold on there . i &apos;m their lawyer .
and you can threaten me all you want ,
but they &apos;re entitled to representation , and you know that .
and i also know you , and all those cameras that you love so much ,
they &apos;re all downstairs waiting for your perp walk .
you &apos;re bluffing .
jj .
wait .
i , uh , i don &apos;t know where jesse and carla are .
what more do you want ?
so , that super helpful law firm
gave me some curious intel regarding jesse and his mom .
how far back does the relationship go ?
according to some legally binding documents , 3 months .
see , carla was doing a little planning for the future
and she utilized said law firm to set up a trust ,
with two trustees . can you guess their names ? can you ?
wallace and jesse ?
wrong . well , half wrong . jesse is named ,
but the other mysterious trustee is bill robbins .
and who &apos;s that , mama ?
you haven &apos;t heard that name yet , have you ?
bill robbins went to college with carla 30 years ago .
thanks , baby girl .
30 years ago is when she conceived the twins .
bill robbins must be the father .
and this trust is why she burned any mention of him .
if we found out who bill robbins was ,
we find the paper trail that connected carla to jesse .
not to mention that he could know where wallace and jesse are .
all right , you two talk to bill robbins .
i &apos;m going to have another shot at the lawyer .
it he &apos;s representing the whole family ,
he knows more than he &apos;s telling us .
we can &apos;t stay out in the open .
the cops are looking for us in this thing .
what about mom ? would she help us ?
maybe .
if we don &apos;t tell her what we &apos;ve done .
is there a place we can all go ?
yeah .
where mom always took me to feel safe .
where is that ?
church .
i don &apos;t know what else you want .
you &apos;ve got the files .
i want you to understand exactly where you sit .
you belong to the fbi and you &apos;re going to tell us everything
that &apos;s not in those files .
who contacted you first , carla or jesse ?
i don &apos;t know .
i helped him unseal his record a year ago .
he didn &apos;t bring it up again
until he brought her in as a client .
told me to do whatever she needed .
and that &apos;s when you set up the trust ?
yeah .
and from the beginning , the whole thing was bizarre .
i mean , the way she talked to me about jesse--
&quot; he &apos;s the son i should have kept .
i &apos;ll have the perfect family now . &quot;
and setting up the trust was her way of proving it to him .
that &apos;s why she named the father .
it was all part of a manipulation .
well , it worked .
jesse signed everything .
but when i went to go get the dad &apos;s signature ,
that &apos;s when i found out just how messed up that family was .
how &apos;s that ?
well , you &apos;ve met bill robbins , haven &apos;t you ?
how you doin &apos; ? fbi .
we &apos;re looking for a mr. bill robbins .
the sun and the moon have arrived .
i &apos;m ready to join you in your golden chariot .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions , if you have a moment .
yes .
yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes !
my life is the answer to your questions .
come in . come in .
uh , sit .
full @-@ scale psychotic break when he turned 25,
right after jesse was put up for adoption .
well , no wonder his sons turned out the way they did .
schizophrenics are rarely psychopathic .
if the twins are predisposed genetically to kill ,
they didn &apos;t get it from their father .
where are my manners ? have a seat . have a seat .
do you like my artwork ?
yeah , i do .
is that your feces ?
maybe .
so mom &apos;s been manipulating jesse from the beginning .
to do what ?
to kill wallace .
is she capable of that ?
she &apos;s a vindictive narcissist
whose entire self @-@ image
is wrapped up in being the perfect mother .
why couldn &apos;t i be the perfect mom
and have the perfect kids like all the other moms ?
i deserve that !
ok , i can buy narcissist ,
but i can &apos;t buy murderer ,
not of her own child .
she said that she chose wallace
because he validated her from the crib
and that &apos;s he &apos;s been a disappointment ever since .
if she wanted wallace dead ,
why did she try to meet him at the station ?
she wasn &apos;t there to meet wallace , she was there to meet jesse .
how do you know ?
she didn &apos;t buy a ticket .
she was there to make sure that the plan was in motion .
but jesse didn &apos;t show .
well , he &apos;s got his own plan .
he &apos;s much less malleable that she thought .
so she &apos;s improvising now .
she &apos;s got to find a way to bring both boys together .
and this time she &apos;s not going to leave anything to chance .
she &apos;ll make sure jesse does it .
her ideal scenario-- jesse kills wallace
and she gets to stay the perfect mother .
my boys .
can the father answer any questions right now ?
you have to understand , eggs are the devil &apos;s cholesterol .
it &apos;s hit or miss .
ask him if carla or the twins visited him recently ?
if not , found out if there &apos;s
any shared family history before the adoption .
we &apos;ll do what we can , but we might need a plan b .
oh , my god , wallace , what have you done now ?
mom , stop . we need some money and your car .
can you help us ?
of course i can .
you &apos;re my babies .
jesse ,
look at you .
i have waited so long
for this moment .
me , too .
well , this is quite the family reunion , isn &apos;t it ?
i just wish that it could go on forever .
well , it can &apos;t .
we gotta go .
wait a minute .
i just want to hold you one more time .
mom , not now . jeez !
wallace .
make time for this .
yes , wallace .
make time for your mother .
mr. robbins , have you seen your sons lately ?
yes , wallace and jesse . wallace is the older one .
he &apos;s teachable . i can teach him things .
but jesse looks more like me .
when was the last time that you saw them ?
not long ago .
one was potty @-@ trained , but the other wasn &apos;t .
they were toddlers .
and they were crying because carla was crying .
and a magical woman took jesse away .
he &apos;s describing the adoption .
she was a saint , letting her son die like that .
who do you mean ? you mean carla ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no . not her .
the woman that took jesse away .
she was a saint .
she made the ultimate sacrifice .
she let her son die .
i know who he &apos;s talking about .
st. mary &apos;s . the church st. mary &apos;s ?
we think that &apos;s what the dad was describing to us .
yeah , jj and i dug it up when we were researching jesse .
it &apos;s the church he was adopted through .
it &apos;s also how carla would see herself ,
as the most revered mother of all time .
have sergeant johnson notify swat .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you hate me , don &apos;t you ?
i do not hate you .
i love you .
i love you so much , i want to just eat ...
you ...
up .
do it fast .
aah ! no !
jesse ?
what are you doing ?
i spent some quality time with wallace , mom .
and i &apos;ve discovered that i &apos;ve got more in common with him
than with you .
jesse , you put down that cleaver .
just listen to me .
no , you listen to me ! don &apos;t you hurt her .
do you even know who she is ?
she &apos;s our mother .
mother ?
she abandoned me !
and then she tried to convince me to kill you .
you &apos;re lying !
i &apos;m not !
she wouldn &apos;t do that .
she begged me to do it .
did you say yes ?
yeah , i did .
but i couldn &apos;t go through with it .
it &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m like you , remember ?
i want you do do exactly as i told you to do .
do you hear me ? exactly !
raise the gun .
raise it a little higher . a little higher .
pull the trigger .
pull it .
fine .
fbi !
fbi !
drop your weapon now !
wallace was out of control .
he forced us to come here .
he was gonna shoot us both .
thank god jesse was stronger than he was .
i &apos;ll only talk to my lawyer .
take them both into custody .
show me your hands .
we &apos;ll fingerprint him at the station ,
see who matches who .
fingerprint analysis isn &apos;t an exact science .
a good defense lawyer can poke holes in it .
