i got a job .
boston ? you &apos;re gonna move to --
we &apos;re gonna move to boston .
i &apos;m pregnant .
i assume tom is the father .
i know you want to believe that our work is done ,
but it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m thinking about giving the baby up for adoption .
why would you do that ?
my life is so filled with death ,
how can i bring a child into that world ?
the job fell through .
reddington .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll figure something else out .
i &apos;m not a threat to your safety , lizzy , or your child &apos;s .
but i cannot do that if you run away .
you &apos;re the only reason i need protection .
i @-@ if you could please call me , it &apos;s about ...
giving up my child .
mr. eriksson , so sorry for the wait .
if you &apos;ll follow me .
happy , baby , what &apos;s wrong ?
wait outside .
no , happy , let &apos;s just go !
no !
no !
no , rafael , please !
that was peter .
the vacarros are gathering .
listen to me .
i don &apos;t care if they see it coming .
i don &apos;t care if you send them engraved invitations
to their own funerals .
dad wants them hit ,
and he wants rafael vacarro found -- today .
gentlemen .
you must be lost , friend .
oh , my , certainly not , dag .
may i call you dag ?
and gregor .
please accept my deepest condolences
for the tragedy that has befallen your beloved brother .
who the hell are you ?
a friend -- here to see your father .
our father &apos;s not seeing anyone .
oh , he &apos;ll see me .
this symbol -- i saw it once .
said to be the mark of the man who can do the impossible .
i was so very sorry to hear about your son .
perhaps i could be of some assistance .
what kind of assistance ?
i fear this child may be lost .
i &apos;m here to help you save the others .

raymond , i know that you &apos;re always going to do
what you believe is the right thing to do .
but i don &apos;t ever want you to think
that you have to change your plans on my account .
plans change .
between seoul , moscow , then back to beijing ,
then shanghai ,
it would have been a month and a half .
i canceled it .
i wanted to bring you something .
oh , raymond .
what good is a collection if it doesn &apos;t grow ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s german -- pre @-@ war .
survived the allied bombing in &apos; 45 .
miracle .
what is it ?
i &apos;m getting married .
do you love him ?
i love you .
you don &apos;t have to explain , liz .
whatever reason you have for giving your child up for adoption ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a good one .
when tom and i were looking to start a family ,
you gave us all the information about the birth mother .
would you be giving prospective parents information about me ?
couples looking to adopt know children
often come from difficult backgrounds .
and that &apos;s okay .
even in an open adoption , i mean ,
i would need to see the child .
that makes it more difficult but not impossible .
whatever a mother &apos;s issues ,
they &apos;re rarely held against the child .
you &apos;ll fill out a questionnaire ,
which i &apos;ll make available to prospective parents .
at the same time ,
you &apos;ll be able to look at their profiles online .
and if we both swipe right ,
we &apos;re hooked up for life ?
if you and tom swipe right .
he does have a say in this .
yeah , of course .
this is a decision that we have to make together ,
and i mean , he would be here
if he didn &apos;t have to be away for work right now .
excuse me , where &apos;s your restroom ?
gina .
why are you doing this ?
hey , jacob . how you doing ?
it was nice to hear from you , too .
it wasn &apos;t nice hearing from you ,
and i want to know why you &apos;re doing it -- the real reason .
i see your new home is a work in progress .
what colors are you considering ?
you know , i usually like people
to enter my apartment after i &apos;m in it .
have you ever heard of the promnestria ?
no , is he here , too ?
it &apos;s a term the ancient greeks used
to describe a matchmaker -- a negotiator .
in this case , a man who brings together warring crime families
through mutual self @-@ interest , leverage ,
or violence if necessary .
my mother -- was she still alive when i was placed with sam ?
yes .
why did she do it ?
i let myself in because the situation is urgent .
on wall street , a well @-@ planned merger
can return a windfall profit .
criminal enterprises are no different .
the promnestria convinces sworn enemies
that there is more profit in friendship .
in return , he gets a percentage of the new venture .
he only surfaces when he sees an opportunity
for enormous financial gain .
and i &apos;m afraid he has resurfaced
to unite two very lethal enemies .
how did my mother die ?
as i said , the matter is urgent .
mads eriksson runs a criminal conglomerate
with his three sons .
or at least he did .
hans eriksson , a.k.a. happy ,
who later died ,
was shot in a new york restaurant by rafael vacarro ,
son of daniel vacarro .
patriarch of the vacarro consortium .
they transported the heroin
processed by the erikssons until 2003
when they had a falling out over a hijacked shipment .
each family blamed the other .
and gregor eriksson was shot ,
and vacarro &apos;s nephew was killed .
if these organizations do merge ,
they &apos;d rival the mexican cartels for the majority
of the drugs trafficking on the east coast .
start with the d.e.a.
find out what they know about a merger .
pull every tap , listen to every call .
if either side has said so much as a hello to this promnestria ,
i want to know about it .
i &apos;m gonna throw you a baby shower .
oh , samar , no --
all i need is a guest list
and whether you want brunch or dinner ,
co @-@ ed or single sex ,
and where you &apos;re registered .
i &apos;m not registered .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to the d.e.a. ,
and you are going to go to swag4mommy.com
and hunt for some cute onesies .
swag4mommy.com ?
who are you ?
a jewish mother . part of my mossad training .
darlings , wonderful news .
mr. eriksson and mr. vacarro
are open to hearing about our merger proposal .
i agree .
no , i &apos;ve promised a solution , and we must deliver .
yes , we &apos;ll need to be very creative .
what &apos;s that ?
no , no , no , no . say again .
oh ... my .
that is a brilliant idea .
marilyn , you are a hopeless romantic .
here , that &apos;s for you .
you , you &apos;ve been of no help whatsoever .
that &apos;s why you want in on this ? for her ?
your phony wife ?
we &apos;re not married .
the mark you dumped me for ?
she &apos;s pregnant .
we &apos;re having a kid , so , yeah , i &apos;m doing this for liz .
you expect me to hire you
so you and the woman who sent me to prison
can live happily ever after in the south of france ?
you can think whatever you want , gina ,
and i don &apos;t blame you for thinking the worst ,
but i need the job .
all right ? i need the money .
the major has been looking for you
ever since you left him for dead with those neo @-@ nazis .
this is his op .
i work for him .
you honestly expect me to bring you on and not tell the major ?
you know what he &apos;ll do to me if he finds out ?
i get it . i never should have called .
all right , i was desperate , and i thought --
&quot; gee , let me call the girl i dumped
to see if she can help with the girl i knocked up . &quot;
it was nice seeing you .
the take is $ 22 million .
split six ways .
you &apos;ll have to split your share with the missus .
where are you getting your intel ?
a confidential source .
i see .
so the d.e.a. &apos; s supposed to hand over all our surveillance ,
but you get to play it close to the vest ?
look , we could be allies or enemies .
we &apos;re asking for help , not demanding it .
and we &apos;re sharing what we know .
our information is that a merger of the families was proposed .
proposed by who ?
well , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
i mean , you know these guys .
who could make the peace ?
peace ? with happy getting popped ?
if you weren &apos;t talking about peace ,
i &apos;d be prepping for an escalation ,
which is what i should be doing .
tucker .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
when ?
mads and danny rolled in an hour ago .
we also got a hit on vacarro &apos;s wire .
we think they &apos;re gonna meet .
guess that makes us allies .
there &apos;s a lot of people out here .
you , uh , sure about your intel ?
you &apos;re questioning my intel
but didn &apos;t know your own partner was a russian spy ?
yeah , &apos; cause i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re not an agent either , comrade .
so i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing here .
oh , come on . she &apos;s just a pregnant lady taking photos .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
i &apos;ve got a 20 on danny vacarro .
east side , walking to the corner .
eriksson coming in from the south .
yeah .
say &quot; cheese . &quot;
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d come .
the promnestria &apos;s reputation precedes him .
i &apos;ve got men all around the park .
yeah , me too .
jesus , navabi .
seeing as how your boy made the first move ,
like father , like son .
that &apos;s him . are you guys seeing this ?
look , we need to hear what &apos;s going on in there .
gentlemen , join us . please .
i &apos;m not drinking with him .
please .
you say you can save my children ?
you have five minutes to tell me how .
navabi , get ears in there now .
every successful merger is based on a recognition
of mutual interest , yes ?
merger ?
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s your proposal ?
that we merge our businesses ?
if i can get closer to the windows ,
i might be able to catch something .
if we don &apos;t actually hear them conspiring ,
we &apos;ve got nothing .
your organizations both value family .
it &apos;s your greatest strength
and the source of your greatest friction .
so remove the friction .
stop the bloodshed by joining the bloodlines .
your youngest son ,
your youngest daughter ...
bound in marriage .
yes , you can do the impossible --
find something we can agree on .
this marriage will never happen .
this marriage must happen .
before your falling out ,
you controlled 65 % of the drug trade on the eastern seaboard .
now you control 22 % .
you may not want to merge ,
but if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll be out of business .
my daughter &apos;s not a commodity to use in a business negotiation .
studies show that love , satisfaction , and commitment
are equally common in both arranged
and love @-@ based marriages .
so i am confident that my proposal
can result in happiness and financial reward .
what you &apos;re proposing requires trust .
we have none .
none of my clients do ,
which is why you , like all my clients ,
must swear to uphold and enforce not only this merger ,
but all mergers brokered with my assistance .
here is my client list .
they are powerful and well @-@ armed .
should either of you betray the other ,
they will destroy your families .
you &apos;ll want some time to think it over .
i do hope you see the merit in my proposal .
we do so love a wedding .
yes , we do .
yes , we do .
yes , we do .
what you &apos;re talking about isn &apos;t a job .
it &apos;s a suicide mission .
only two crews have targeted reinder @-@ de groot .
both were slaughtered .
by geert klerken , i know .
but that was 12 years ago .
which is why nobody has been crazy enough to try it since .
well , almost no one .
over the past four months ,
a crew of mine has been lifting a piece here ,
a piece there from their showroom ,
adding up to almost half a million dollars .
why would you antagonize a psychopath for $ 500,000 ?
to get his attention .
reinder @-@ de groot uses only the finest stones .
they &apos;re transferred to a secure vault
and basement work rooms ,
where they &apos;re placed in settings
and shipped to stores all around the world .
and you want to hit those work rooms ?
i &apos;m getting in .
all i need is a pretty face to help me get there .
know where i can find one of those ?
remember the jazz club you took me to
in that little cave in st. germain ?
we should go there right now .
no , it closed .
when did it close ?
six months ago .
oh , my gosh .
it &apos;s been that long .
i can protect you .
all you need to do is ask .
you know what i need ?
i need you to take me to amorino .
buy me a stracciatella .
and then maybe i &apos;ll give you a bite .
raymond . we have arrived .
hello , lizzy . you have the photo ?
good luck getting an i.d. the d.e.a. had nothing .
facial recognition was a bust .
c.s.u. swept for prints ,
but it &apos;s an active business .
they pulled hundreds of latents .
running those will take time we don &apos;t have .
your law enforcement agencies
love their gadgets and their sweeps .
the fbi admitted to spending , what ,
a billion dollars in facial @-@ recognition software ?
which means they spent at least $ 3 billion .
honestly , if i paid taxes , i &apos;d be outraged .
rogelio !
como esta ?
bien . raymond !
hey , hola , dembe .
what happened to your arm ?
snowboarding .
this man , i want him found .
for you , raymond , claro que sí .
right now hotel maids , cooks , waiters ,
valets all over the city are receiving that photo
and will be searching for our target .
the people who do all the cooking , cleaning ,
washing , carrying , and parking ,
they have access to everything .
you may recall i once had the opportunity
to broker the sale of rembrandt &apos;s
&quot; storm on the sea of galilee . &quot;
you mean do i remember you being in possession
of a stolen masterpiece ? yeah , i recall that .
well , the man who actually stole the painting --
rogelio &apos;s cousin was his gardener .
how is tony ?
deported . last month .
dembe will give you the number of our man in calexico .
he just built a fabulous tunnel .
we &apos;ll have tony back by this time next week .
many thank yous , my friend .
your fee and a bonus to the first person to spot our man .
how the hell did reddington find this guy ?
he &apos;s like a magician . i hate magicians .
that and lap dogs .
i mean , i really hate lap dogs .
aram , what have you got ?
all right , the money for the room was wired
from a phony overseas account ,
but i do have a cell number used to book the reservation .
mr. cooper is expediting a warrant for a tap .
also , according to the registry ,
his name is maximiliano cartier ,
马西米利亚诺 · 卡迪尔
which however awesome is obviously a fake .
speaking of registries , aram ,
do you want to go in on a baby gift for liz ?
she register for common sense ?
&apos;cause if she &apos;s down for having tom &apos;s kid , she needs some .
i think it &apos;s romantic to forgive someone you love
even if they had an insane error in judgment ,
which gives you night sweats
and causes you to lose nine pounds in a month .
i mean , it could anyway , in ...
in theory .
he &apos;s got company .
mr. vacarro has agreed to move forward if you agree .
what about the stumbling block ?
i have a solution .
but i should warn you it will require you to mislead your son .
hey , guys . bad news --
the cell number he used to book the room is a burner .
who is this guy ?
you &apos;re asking me to hurt my son .
but if i say no , this war will kill him .
you have my permission .
my people are standing by .
it will be done today .
all right , you stick with eriksson .
i &apos;ll , uh , stay with liberace and the pooches .
you want our daughter to marry an eriksson ?
no , it &apos;s not what i want , but after two decades --
this won &apos;t change that !
we agree that it will .
and this agreement is enforceable .
by whom ? this man you just met ?
he has the power to keep the peace ?
the killing has to stop .
and whatever price we have to pay to make that happen --
i thought you were mad &apos; cause i scratched the car .
alicia .
baby , we &apos;re not doing this .
mama , i &apos;m not a child anymore .
i know who we are .
all the funerals , the sacrifices made for this family --
i &apos;ve always wondered what i would have to do
to make a difference .
maybe now i know .
yeah , he &apos;s still outside at city memorial .
he hasn &apos;t moved in about , uh , 20 minutes .
why ?
i don &apos;t know , but maybe you can tell me .
why don &apos;t you search patient records ,
staff , physicians , anyone with the last name eriksson or vacarro .
i &apos;m looking , but ...
hold on .
no , nothing .
oh , hang on , hang on . he &apos;s moving .
so , i think i have an hour for lunch .
you know you won &apos;t have to work once we &apos;re married .
really ?
what if i want to ?
hang on . anna gardner .
注册护士
she &apos;s christopher eriksson &apos;s fiancée
and a nurse at city memorial .
christopher -- which one is that ?
he &apos;s the youngest son .
that must be why the promnestria is there .
get out of the way ! move !
anna !
baby .
no , no . no , no , no .
fbi , fbi !
hey , come here ! come here !
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
this is mr. fox , our inside man .
communications , security , our gemologist , the driver .
very friendly .
gentlemen . we hit reinder @-@ de groot at 5 : 45 .
15 minutes before the security swing shift arrives .
that &apos;s the window . we get caught , we &apos;re dead .
not arrested , dead .
okay , then .
let &apos;s go to work .
i got you a little something .
some might say it &apos;s a disguise ,
but i guess it &apos;s who you really are .
just my size .
such a pretty face .
christopher .
she &apos;s dead .
i know .
they came for me , and they got her .
we have to go after them -- hard .
what we have to do is make it stop .
what does that mean ?
who are you ?
you were at the hospital .
my dear boy ,
i simply cannot convey the depth
of my condolences for your senseless loss .
and killing a harmless girl , a true innocent --
it &apos;s proof that this conflict must end .
we have something to discuss .
they said they &apos;re interested ?
yes , they &apos;re dying to meet you .
they &apos;re checking their schedule ,
but they said they want to meet as soon as possible .
oh , that &apos;s perfect .
well , uh , as soon as you have a time ,
just give me a call back .
okay , that &apos;s great , levi . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
levi ?
how is your impossibly gorgeous ex ?
he asked me to dinner , so i &apos;m going . it &apos;s nothing .
have you decided where to register ?
the burp rags can wait .
what happened at the hospital ?
her name was anna gardner .
she was a nurse at city memorial
and christopher eriksson &apos;s fiancée .
why would the promnestria have christopher killed ?
all it does is make his family hate the vacarros even more ,
if that &apos;s possible .
he wasn &apos;t after the son .
the fiancée was the target .
he &apos;s brokering a marriage .
between these two families ? that &apos;s absurd .
you really think it &apos;s possible
that he had christopher &apos;s fiancée killed
so christopher would be available to marry a vacarro ?
arranged marriage has been a tool of peacekeeping
and empire @-@ building for centuries .
it &apos;s still practiced in many parts
of asia , africa , the middle east .
thousands of children are forced
into arranged marriages every year ,
often with judicial approval .
the erikssons and vacarros are not just families ,
they &apos;re businesses .
this isn &apos;t about love and marriage .
this is about profit and loss .
the promnestria will require a meeting
of all family members to formalize the arrangement .
find that meeting , and you &apos;ll find him .
and how do you propose we do that ?
funny you should ask , harold .
hello , mads .
raymond reddington .
your contact at the port of new orleans -- call him .
confirm he received an anonymous tip about a d.e.a. raid .
saved you about $ 10 million in lost inventory .
do you have any cookies ?
i @-@ it &apos;s me . i &apos;m told there was a raid .
and we &apos;re good ?
these are yummy . it &apos;s the nutmeg , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ll call you soon .
you tipped my people ? why ?
wedding present .
you heard .
i respect the decision , mads .
difficult one , i &apos;m sure , but good for business .
mazel tov .
my kid is not happy about it .
what about you ? danny vacarro for an in @-@ law ?
talk about a labor of love .
thank you for the tip , raymond .
the families , theirs and ours ,
we &apos;re getting together tomorrow .
it &apos;d be nice to have a friendly face .
i &apos;d rather die than have an eriksson touch my little girl .
so would i.
but you &apos;re giving her away .
for what ?
a business deal that will never hold ?
a war that will never end ?
oh , it will .
the erikssons are all coming to the celebration .
what are you saying ?
we kill them tomorrow .
all of them .
we staged the d.e.a. raid
so reddington could tip off the erikssons .
in exchange , he was supposed to give us intel
on the families meeting .
so where the hell is he ?
i can &apos;t get him to call me back .
okay , so , i &apos;ve been monitoring the promnestria &apos;s burner ,
and he just placed a call
to some kind of personal assistant , i think .
the call was made to a residence in london
owned by a mr. alistair pitt .
so scotland yard pulled his taxes .
he &apos;s the right age for our suspect ,
claims he &apos;s a corporate consultant .
here . and listen .
there &apos;s a dinner tonight at the greenwald to formalize .
i &apos;ll need a car to take us there at 7 : 00,
then directly to the airport .
notify ressler and samar .
i want infiltration teams at the greenwald hotel
as soon as possible .
keen , if reddington reaches out ,
don &apos;t take his call .
mobile 1 , we &apos;ve accessed the hotel feeds .
all units report .
eriksson is walking in now .
gregor and dag are behind him .
davenport . come back .
security &apos;s tight .
no weapons , no phones .
on the vacarro side , i &apos;m seeing danny , mariana .
no sign of rafael .
he knows there &apos;s an open warrant .
warrant or not , everybody who shows up tonight
is getting brought in for questioning , no exceptions .
you got approval for that ?
pitt murdered an innocent woman .
when he shows , we take them all .
whoa , look what the cat dragged in .
your fugitive @-@ in @-@ arms , comrade rostova .
don &apos;t call me that .
davenport , we got a visual on raymond reddington .
moving your way . we &apos;re gonna breach .
negative , i repeat , negative .
do not breach .
this is our op .
we breach now , we lose pitt .
look , we &apos;ll sweep him up when we grab the others ,
but only once we see our target .
oh , i really do fancy this necklace .
and that ring .
can i see ?
of course .
where is the mirror ?
it &apos;s over there .
it is very nice , but it &apos;s about three zeros out of my budget .
oh , my god .
i have to have it .
oh , i left the keys in the car . ugh .
colin would kill me if i got another one nicked .
be back .
all right .
help ! somebody !
sir ! release that woman !
she &apos;s a thief .
agent brian kelly , fbi .
this woman is part of a gang that my team
has been investigating for six months .
i knew it ! they owe me a half a million .
her team is still somewhere in the area .
do you have somewhere i can take her , somewhere private ?
let &apos;s go .
i need to call in the rest of my squad to secure the suspect .
do you have a back entrance we could use ?
meet the police at the loading dock .
let them in the back .
suspect in custody . come in through the back . copy ?
copy that . on our way .
champagne ?
thank you , my dear .
mr. reddington .
i &apos;m so honored you were able to join us .
i &apos;m a sucker for mob weddings .
what a night .
raymond , right ?
mads tells me you two have business dealings ?
i didn &apos;t know the two of you were on a first @-@ name basis .
we &apos;re doing our best to forgive and forget .
there &apos;s some good in the worst of us
and some evil in the best of us .
and when we discover this ,
we are less prone to hate our enemies .
to our enemies .
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry , raymond , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
all things considered , mom &apos;s a little cheery .
keep an eye on her and danny while i find the happy couple .
you loved her , didn &apos;t you ?
let me tell you a secret .
love isn &apos;t a feeling .
it &apos;s a choice .
ah ! darling , come in .
come , come , come .
come , come , come .
i understand you two have had an opportunity to talk .
that &apos;s good .
then we &apos;re agreed .
i &apos;ve got eyes on reddington , tucker .
do i have the go or not ?
negative .
i was told to give you guys carte blanche
because you &apos;re bringing down guys
justice hasn &apos;t even heard of .
when i asked how you did it , i never got a straight answer .
i think i know why .
you don &apos;t know anything .
i know we helped you when you were a fugitive .
now , what aren &apos;t you telling me , comrade rostova ?
i told you not to call me that .
it &apos;s all here .
right after i finish the toast .
when i raise my glass , that &apos;s the signal .
ladies and gentlemen ...
as the father of the bride , i &apos;d like to say a few words .
so much of what has happened
between our families has been ... wrong .
and it &apos;s enough .
and if it takes my baby girl to show me the path to peace ,
so be it .
mads , you have my guarantee
that no vacarro will ever break the agreement
that we &apos;ve made here today .
may they have the patience to endure one more toast .
i am but a humble guest ,
but please permit me to raise a glass
to what i think we all can agree
is the most improbable yet consequential occasion .
what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s trying to draw the promnestria out .
love is a funny , fickle thing .
a slippery slope .
most weddings are fraught with it .
this one , not so much . this is business .
the brainchild of a brilliant opportunist --
a broker of bonds , a procurer of peace .
you would think , being singularly responsible
for this evening &apos;s prenuptials , he might take a bow .
where is he ?
come now , don &apos;t be modest .
you do such astonishing , despicable work .
maybe i think it &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m dying to hear how he did it .
how he brought you two jackals together .
how he got rid of christopher &apos;s fiancée , anna .
how he lied to the boy ,
let him believe she was slaughtered by the vacarros ,
only to turn around and convince him
to marry into the very family he despises .
what a telenovela !
what the hell are you --
no , no , no , wait .
i want to hear what he &apos;s saying .
i once spent three weeks cooped up in motel on zihuatanejo
just glued to the telenovela &quot; amorcito corazon &quot; --
&quot; my darling sweetheart . &quot;
this unlucky @-@ in @-@ love architect who lost the love of her life
when she was 18 because of her controlling father .
but perhaps i cut too close to the bone .
it was you , mads , who approved the hit .
isn &apos;t that right ?
dad , what is he talking about ?
he &apos;s wrong . never would i have --
... deceive your son , killing the love of his life .
they killed anna -- you said so .
no , no , no , no . we never touched that girl .
you &apos;re the animals who operate like that , not us .
oh , here we go . better than tv .
you killed her , didn &apos;t you ?
for this ?
you knew i would never be able to let her go .
we did it to save you !
for the good of the family !
gentlemen , everyone !
please , please .
that &apos;s our target .
all teams on site , breach , breach now !
do it now .
grab the bride and groom . meet us at the car .
d.e.a. ! freeze ! drop your weapon .
this was so you could get to him .
that &apos;s what this whole thing was about .
might i suggest we have this conversation on the move ?
she &apos;s not going anywhere .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
i knew it . he &apos;s your informant .
that &apos;s why you have so much juice ,
why they let you off .
isn &apos;t that right , comrade rostova ?
i told you not to call me that .
comrade --
mr. pitt and i have a plane to catch .
we most certainly do not .
i &apos;d be happy to drop you somewhere safe along the way .
you want to tell me how many are on your team ?
i &apos;ve told you there &apos;s no team .
it was a mistake . i was in a hurry ,
and i must have put the ring in my pocket --
would you mind turning those off ?
i &apos;d be delighted .
hey , we know your gang is hitting jewelry stores
all over the city .
all right , i want names , and i want them right now .
you want to have a go ?
i thought you would never ask .
that &apos;s for hitting me harder than you were supposed to .
what was that for ?
the hell of it .
come on , family man . we have work to do .
let &apos;s go .
samar , i just spoke to the d.a. ,
and he says he has enough evidence
to put both families out of business .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
um , did you ever get registered ? because aram is asking .
samar , what &apos;s wrong ?
i had dinner with levi .
he &apos;s engaged .
to a woman he met a week after we broke up .
and it &apos;s fine . we were never gonna be ...
it &apos;s just , um ...
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
forget it .
let &apos;s just talk about the shower and how great it will be .
there &apos;s not going to be a shower .
why not ?
well ...
... i found this wonderful couple .
josephine .
josephine , open this door right now !
he knows . he knows about us .
josephine !
where are you ?
our apartment , place st. pierre .
hurry , please .
he &apos;s insane .
josephine ?
josephine ?
no . josephine .
you ! get out !
what are you gonna do ?
josephine . josephine .
josephine , no .
i bought this flat four years ago .
so that some day i could bring you here
to the scene of your crime .
josephine molire .
now , listen ...
josephine &apos;s father was the most prolific
criminal arms dealer in eastern europe .
but for all his success , he had a problem ,
an enemy .
an aggressive and lethal competitor named stockwell .
i had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl --
yes , you did .
perhaps not directly , but very much by your hand .
you arranged a marriage .
the youngest molire daughter to the only stockwell son--
a burgeoning psychopath
with a long and troubling history of violence .
to guarantee peace and profit for all ,
you arranged her marriage to this man .
please . don &apos;t .
don &apos;t do this .
i held her in my arms
and watched the life disappear from her eyes .
you destroyed a creature
more beautiful than you could ever comprehend .
♬ in these demon days ♬
♬ we &apos;re pulling our pay ♬
they &apos;re not coming .
there &apos;s been a bump .
♬ the lights on the hill ♬
♬ are freezing us still ♬
they &apos;re rejecting my baby ?
no , not exactly . they still want the baby .
♬ the fingers of fate ♬
♬ stretch out and take ♬
♬ us to a night ♬
oh , i see .
♬ but something &apos;s not right ♬
they &apos;re rejecting me .
♬ something &apos;s gone wrong ♬
but i thought you said on the phone ...
they hadn &apos;t put it together that you were that elizabeth keen .
i &apos;m sorry , liz .
but they &apos;ll only take the baby if it &apos;s a closed adoption .
meaning i would never know my child ?
my baby would never know who i am ?
i can &apos;t do that .
i underestimated how difficult this was gonna be .
but if you are intent on giving up your child ,
i think you have to accept
that you &apos;re not gonna be able to be in its life .

josephine ...
it &apos;s done .
