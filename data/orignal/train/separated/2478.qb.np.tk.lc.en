whatever &apos;s inside that vault ,
it wants out .
and you have to promise me ,
you won &apos;t let alex set it free .
i promise .
bonnie , please !
no one &apos;s getting out .
when she wakes , she &apos;ll be just like me ,
full of hatred for you and your kind
you need to get as far away from her as you can .
do you love him ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you love someone
and leave them behind right when you need each other the most ?
i &apos;m still mad at you .
you put me , quite literally , through hell
and i &apos;m not ready to let that go yet .
but don &apos;t think i &apos;m not noticing all the good
you &apos;ve been doing lately .
bonnie &apos;s life is linked to that of the final everlasting .
sever the link ,
it might also sever the curse .
unfortunately for us ,
the everlasting resides in the armory .
the evil in the basement escaped from its vault ,
and could be anywhere .
we &apos;re gonna open the place back up .
you haven &apos;t heard from him ?
nope . which means , to absolutely no one &apos;s surprise ,
donovan failed and now bonnie &apos;s huntressing in the wild .
all right , well , where is she now ?
coming after one of us .
where else ?
weren &apos;t you meant to be on a plane ?
flights got cancelled because of the storm .
where are you ?
i &apos;m in solution land , baby .
there &apos;s a preserved body at the armory
called &quot; the final everlasting . &quot;
all we have to do is destroy that ,
bonster is a monster no more .
but if you kill the everlasting ,
bonnie dies .
and so do we , for that matter .
i &apos;ve been told differently .
by who ? someone that wants you dead ?
a descendent of the people who created rayna cruz .
yeah , the people who hate us .
well , whether we believe them or not ,
it &apos;s bonnie &apos;s only chance .
look ...
best case scenario , we destroy it ,
everything goes back to normal .
worst case scenario ...
we all die and stefan lives to tell the tale
of our demise to the lovely elena .
are you forgetting about the other problem that &apos;s in there ?
oh , you mean the ambiguously terrifying
monster from the vault ?
i &apos;m on it .
perhaps once it &apos;s less ambiguous , it will be less terrifying .
guys , it doesn &apos;t matter .
bonnie sealed the whole armory .
you can &apos;t get in .
don &apos;t tell me what i can &apos;t do .
i can &apos;t get in .
plan b.
stefan , call your ex .
obviously , not the one next to you .
valerie .
she can siphon the seal .
that &apos;s great ,
but i have absolutely no idea where to find her .
there is a third option .
and let me just tell you , it is just adorable .
the cutest little plan c &apos;s you &apos;ve ever seen .
no !
absolutely not .
all they have to do is walk up to the door
and put their tiny little siphon hands on it ...
no , my kids are staying out of this , damon .
it &apos;s for bonnie !
no , it &apos;s for us .
so that we don &apos;t have to run anymore .
and that is not a good enough excuse
to involve my children in this mess .
you know these scars that we have link her to us , huh ?
she can probably hear what we &apos;re saying right now .
we &apos;ll find valerie .
whatever , bro .
so what &apos;s it like when you see them ?
i get snippets of conversations .
some visuals .
but mostly , i can feel them .
their emotions .
they &apos;re scared .
and they should be .
the urges are getting stronger .
i can feel it taking over .
i don &apos;t want to hurt them .
then untie me .
let me help you , okay ?
i can stop you .
i know in my heart that i should .
sorry , matt .
my name &apos;s enzo .
bonnie &apos;s friend .
she didn &apos;t listen , did she ?
after everything i said ,
she still opened the vault ?
it &apos;s complicated .
if that thing &apos;s allowed to get out in the world , we &apos;re--
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
we need to know exactly what we &apos;re dealing with ,
so we can fight it .
you can &apos;t fight it .
you can &apos;t kill it .
it &apos;s been alive for thousands of years .
don &apos;t be scared , love .
now tell me what it is .
then lizzie had three cookies ,
and i only had two .
two and a half .
this sure is a lot of cookie talk for 8 : 00 in the morning .
yeah , well , the girls wanted cookies
and daddy needed something to take his mind off things .
so you stress baked ?
there &apos;s got to be a more masculine way you could say that .
i miss you , mommy .
i miss you , too , baby .
all right , wave good @-@ bye , girls .
bye .
bye .
be safe .
they &apos;re three years old .
they shouldn &apos;t be involved in this world .
not yet .
lizzie siphoned me the other day .
the girls had their friend &apos;s birthday party ,
and lizzie took josie &apos;s goodie bag .
i took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm .
she didn &apos;t mean to .
i just want them to have as normal a childhood as possible .
it &apos;s your decision .
period .
thank you .
this doesn &apos;t let you off the hook , you know .
for the leaving or the kidnapping .
no ?
no .
not even a ... a little bit ?
nope . not even a little bit .
i feel ... a thaw .
there is definitely not a thaw .
okay .
bonnie ?
i need you to drive faster .
why ? what happened ?
i &apos;m gaining on you .
tell stefan to drive faster and don &apos;t stop .
how &apos;d you catch up to us ?
we have a police siren , okay ?
it &apos;s been helpful .
okay . we won &apos;t stop , i promise .
all units , we have a six @-@ car pileup
on eastbound 60 at franklin drive .
injuries reported . please respond .
tell me we &apos;re not on 60 .
we &apos;re on 60 .
oh , no .
i got this .
stefan ?
why do i feel you getting closer ?
all you have to do is let us drive by you , bonnie .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can .
no , she can &apos;t !
come on , bonnie .
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
let me guess : it &apos;s an ancient , tentacled evil
that will destroy our lives and the world as we know it .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
no tentacles .
do i even want to know ?
will it deter you from going in ?
nope .
then no , you don &apos;t .
has anyone heard from valerie ?
unnecessary .
somebody has a plan .
care to share ?
it &apos;s messy .
i fear you &apos;ve forgotten just how messy i can be .
small runway a few miles east of the armory .
meet me there .
bring your cowboy boots .
do you think they &apos;re okay ?
we have to assume they are .
and that she &apos;s still after us .
any word from damon ?
nothing .
listen ...
you should get going .
you &apos;re not coming with me ?
i haven &apos;t heard from damon ,
which means he probably has a plan that doesn &apos;t involve us .
therefore , it can &apos;t be a good one .
i should handle it .
this was the best you could find ?
best , no . closest , yeah .
where &apos;s the pilot ?
called him a few hours ago . he said he &apos;d be here .
well , he was , until you called and told him to forget it .
except i didn &apos;t do that .
are you damon salvatore ?
yes .
well , that &apos;s who called .
you bring that pilot back before i rip your throat out .
spot of turbulence ?
more like interference .
salvatore airlines , may i help you ?
you think you &apos;re clever ?
considering the fact that i tracked down you ,
your pilot and your plan ,
all in a little bit of brotherly intuition ,
yes , damon , as a matter of fact , i do .
have you forgotten that i &apos;m running from a hunter , stefan ?
i &apos;m trying to get out of her way .
oh , come on .
we both know that &apos;s not why you &apos;re getting on the plane .
you have no idea what i &apos;m up to .
really ?
because i think you &apos;re headed to dallas
to kidnap two innocent children .
or i &apos;m headed to dallas to speak to their father
and talk some sense into him .
and if he says no ?
well , then , i will kidnap those two innocent children ,
because that &apos;s the right thing to do .
no . the right thing to do
is to let caroline , their mother ,
decide what &apos;s best for them .
she &apos;s wrong , stefan .
well , it &apos;s her choice
and i &apos;m gonna let her make it .
see ya .
tell me .
bonnie almost got us ,
but i &apos;m okay .
look , you guys can &apos;t keep doing this .
you &apos;ve got to find another way .
damon and enzo can fix her .
well , that &apos;s great .
it involves josie and lizzie .
what ?
what do they need ?
to get into the armory .
lizzie and josie could siphon bonnie &apos;s spell .
i said no .
instantly .
because i thought it was just about me and damon and enzo ,
and that &apos;s fine .
you know , i &apos;m willing to run , they &apos;re willing to run ...
... but then i talked to bonnie on the phone and ...
she &apos;s scared , ric .
and she &apos;s in pain .
but they &apos;re your kids and i can &apos;t make that decision for them .
well , they &apos;re not just my kids , caroline ,
they &apos;re our kids ,
and that &apos;s a decision we need to make together .
she &apos;s my best friend .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
well , look , it &apos;s been almost a week since the girls
have been able to hug their mother , so ...
... if there &apos;s something we can do
to make sure it &apos;s not two weeks , or three ,
or never ...
just tell me what it is we need to do .
matt ?
matt , are you okay ?
you okay ?
yeah .
just stuck .
how about you ? are you okay ?
of course i am .
because if i were dead , then this would all be over
and everyone could go back to their lives .
but we &apos;re not that lucky .
they &apos;d be dead too , bonnie .
they &apos;re marked . if you die , they die .
so this is just gonna go on forever .
it &apos;s okay . i stopped you .
i can keep stopping you .
you &apos;re human , matt .
you don &apos;t belong in this fight .
no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t you leave me , bonnie .
i &apos;m sorry .
bonnie !
hello .
i &apos;m hurt and i need help . is anyone out there ?
well , you &apos;re awfully quiet .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re still mad about the pilot .
caroline &apos;s bringing her kids , and we &apos;re gonna get inside ,
and that &apos;s all that matters .
what happened to you , hmm ?
you and i had a breakthrough yesterday .
you pulled a damon .
you made the right choice , to hell with the consequences .
we actually agreed , stefan .
i sent out a press release .
and then you spend one night with blonde ambition .
you &apos;re right back to your old , boring , choice @-@ matters self .
what the hell , man ?
do you really think that i did the right thing
by taking caroline against her will ?
one hundred percent .
you said that &apos;s how you know you love someone .
and for a second there , i actually , i actually believed you .
i thought that my love for caroline was so strong
that i would do anything to protect it .
but then i realized , that &apos;s not love , damon .
that &apos;s fear .
you should put that on a greeting card .
that night
that you put yourself down ,
it wasn &apos;t because you loved elena .
it was because you were afraid if you didn &apos;t ,
you would do something terrible ,
and you would lose her forever .
and that fear ,
that fear was so powerful
that it overrode any love that you felt for me
or bonnie or anybody else .
it wasn &apos;t about you , stefan .
oh , it had absolutely everything to do with me .
no .
i looked you in the eyes , damon ,
and i begged you to stay .
and you turned your back on me like it was nothing .
and i thought about that yesterday ,
when i &quot; pulled a damon . &quot;
and i realized ...
i never want to be that person .
i refuse to be ruled by fear .
i refuse to be you .
they &apos;re here .
you guys know why we &apos;re here ?
because there &apos;s something inside this building
that &apos;s really important that we need .
the only problem is these doors are locked ,
so we &apos;re gonna need your help to open them , okay ?
want to know something cool ?
you two are special
because you two are the keys .
let &apos;s play a game .
everyone put one hand on the door .
remember amy &apos;s birthday party ?
i took away your goodie bag , and what happened ?
i hurt you .
yes , because i took something from you .
now ...
how would you feel if someone tried to take me away from you ?
mad .
sad .
yeah , me , too .
and if we don &apos;t get inside of here , that might happen .
i might never be able to
see you or hug you or ...
tuck you in at night .
it &apos;s working .
keep going , girls .
good job .
good job , you two !
you did so good .
you both did such a good job .
it &apos;s all over .
calling to apologize for my leg ?
i know what you &apos;re planning .
i can see everyone waiting at the armory .
they &apos;re sitting ducks , enzo .
yeah , except not everyone is waiting at the armory .
what are you doing ?
my part .
i need a favor from you .
i need you to think about me .
no .
all right , i &apos;ll pretend that doesn &apos;t hurt my feelings .
look , i know your urges are strong
and you can &apos;t control them ,
but you can focus them .
chase me , and only me ,
and it &apos;ll give our friends some time to sort all this out .
i &apos;ll catch you , enzo .
give me some credit .
come on , love .
i &apos;ll lead you on a little , wild goose chase .
okay .
i see you .
now come and get me .
where are the little squirts ?
away from whatever &apos;s gonna come out of there .
well , for something to get out we have to be able to get in .
nice .
shall we ?
stefan ...
whatever you &apos;re about to say , just ...
... say when this is over .
wow , this looks ...
promising .
i &apos;ve seen worse .
so this thing that was in the vault
that no one was supposed to open ,
do we know what it is ?
yup .
bad .
enzo says that the final everlasting
is in a coffin somewhere .
so let &apos;s just find this thing and get the hell out of here .
why did you stop ?
i was running out of gas ,
which means you were gonna catch up to me eventually .
i cannot begin to know what you &apos;re feeling ...
... but i thought , if you came here ...
enzo ...
... maybe we could share a meal and a drink ,
one last time .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
come on .
my risotto isn &apos;t that bad .
i &apos;m so sorry .
maybe it is .
this is appropriately creepy .
enzo said don &apos;t go in the vault .
we &apos;ve searched everywhere else .
you know , if you &apos;re scared , damon , you can go , uh ,
wait outside with the three @-@ year @-@ olds .
damon .
you ready to do this or what ?
yeah .
yes , i am .
but i &apos;m gonna do it alone .
like hell you are .
whatever &apos;s down there is nobueno .
which is why you need me .
let me do this , stefan .
there is a girl waiting outside for you ,
and if you go in there with me , and get all screwed up ,
you &apos;re gonna have problems with her , and you &apos;re gonna blame me .
i don &apos;t care .
i can help you .
i know you can ...
and you have .
over and over again ,
you &apos;ve helped me .
and over and over again , it &apos;s screwed you ,
and so , this time , i need a different kind of help , okay ?
i need you ...
to let me go .
let me succeed or let me fail ...
but let me do it by myself .
i &apos;m sorry i walked out on you that night .
you &apos;re right , i was scared .
and i knew you &apos;d be mad , but i also knew that you &apos;d be okay .
i know my choices suck sometimes , and you like to be there
to head them off at the pass , but this time ...
i need you to believe in me .
okay ?
damon , i ...
you don &apos;t want a life ruled by fear ?
then , this time ...
you walk out on me ,
and don &apos;t be afraid of what &apos;ll happen .
trust i &apos;ll be okay .
one way or another ...
i &apos;ll be okay .
yeah .
okay .
listen , if @-@ if you need me , i &apos;ll be ...
right outside .
yeah .
oh , god , it &apos;s been too long .
oh , my god , thank god .
where &apos;s damon ?
it &apos;s not over yet .
i can &apos;t move .
i know .
no , you don &apos;t want to do this .
fight me .
fight me !
push me off of you .
i &apos;m trying ...
but i dare say you &apos;ve gotten stronger .
hold me back .
please , please .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m at my limit .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry , enzo .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
but i need one thing from you .
when this is over , don &apos;t remember this moment .
remember the other ones :
new year &apos;s eve and champagne ...
and your terrible , terrible guitar playing
that never really got any better , even though i said it did .
... and remember
that i had over a century of pain and loneliness
before i found you ...
... and then three ... glorious years of love .
i love you .
i love you , enzo .
there you are .
i can &apos;t hold back anymore .
you don &apos;t have to .
come on !
he did it .
damon did it .
he did it , he did it .
no more scar .
yeah ... i guess he did it .
i &apos;m gonna take the kids home .
good . i &apos;ll get my stuff and ...
no .
no , you should , uh ,
you should stay .
you changed my life ...
you know that , right ?
i mean , you completely turned it around .
and for that , i , uh ...
... i will always love you .
even though i know you don &apos;t love me the same way .
ric ...
it &apos;s okay .
i mean , to be honest , i always knew .
it &apos;s just that , you know , we ...
we had these moments where we were ...
just ... perfectly in sync .
you know , laughing at the kids or ...
in tears because we were so exhausted , i ...
i guess , uh ...
i don &apos;t know , i guess a part of me thought
that maybe , one day , those moments might become something more .
but that wouldn &apos;t be fair to you .
certainly wouldn &apos;t be fair to me , either .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no .
a part of me just ...
loved the idea of a perfect , happy family .
and i didn &apos;t want to let that go .
you should be happy .
i mean , you deserve everything you want .
and no matter what happens , caroline ,
you , me , the kids ...
we &apos;re a family ...
... and we will always , always be a family .
this is quite the mess , isn &apos;t it ?
penny ...
this isn &apos;t real .
really ?
as screwed up as your life is ,
you &apos;re not even going to consider that i could be a ghost ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t mean ...
i know . i know .
you &apos;re a terrible shot .
we established that years ago .
how the hell did you get yourself into this one ?
i just can &apos;t escape this life .
that &apos;s the thing , matt .
you haven &apos;t really tried .
so what do you want to do ?
i just want to be with you .
please take me with you .
sorry , matt .
you don &apos;t belong with me , either .
there &apos;s a better life for you out there .
you just have to wake up and find it .
wake up .
wake up !
he &apos;s conscious .
you lost a lot of blood , but it &apos;s going to be okay .
just stay with me . everything &apos;s going to be okay .
he &apos;s damon .
he &apos;s like a cockroach .
he always survives .
you &apos;re still here .
i still had some things i wanted to say to you when this was over .
he &apos;s okay .
he always is .
so , um , i guess whatever you wanted to say to me ,
you can ... say it now .
i lied earlier .
there was a thaw .
if you think this means you &apos;re forgiven ...
i am so forgiven .
you &apos;re kind of forgiven .
uh , would it have killed you to have done it ,
i don &apos;t know , five minutes sooner ?
wait-- enzo &apos;s still alive ?
damn . i thought i waited long enough .
thank you .
thank me in person with gifts and ...
damon ...
hello ?
hang on .
damon ...
elena ?
what did you just say ?
i can hear her in the vault .
damon .
elena is in a warehouse in brooklyn .
i know , but ...
damon ,
what if something happened to her ?
help me .
what if the armory took her ?
they didn &apos;t .
please ...
i just have to make sure .
damon ! get out of there !
please , help me .
i &apos;m so alone .
i need you .
where are you ?
right here .
where is he ?
the vault .
but he closed the security door .
so open it .
no , we can &apos;t .
only someone from the armory can .
why didn &apos;t you bring enzo ?
i did .
damon ?
just you ?
i snuck off .
didn &apos;t feel like playing scissors , paper , stone
over who was going to save your life .
that &apos;s very heroic of you .
i don &apos;t leave people behind .
not my style .
plus , my girl seems to think that you &apos;re her best friend .
and , uh ... from what i can tell ,
heroes always do right by their girl .
then i should warn you ...
it doesn &apos;t always work out so great .
had a feeling .
but don &apos;t worry ...
it &apos;s not as bad as you think .
it only hurts at first .
then , after that ...
... it &apos;s kinda fun .
dear elena , we were so close .
stefan and i had finally worked through our problems .
bonnie and enzo were on the verge of being happy ,
and damon ...
damon actually did the right thing .
the selfless thing .
we waited in that room for days .
stefan didn &apos;t sleep .
throwing everything , including himself , at that door ,
trying to get it open .
after a week , alaric managed to crack the security code .
we were prepared for almost anything ...
... except what we saw .
it was empty .
enzo ?
completely cleaned out .
i don &apos;t know how they got out ,
but they did .
enzo !
i &apos;m worried about bonnie .
she lost the two people closest to her ,
and she can &apos;t even do a locator spell to find them .
her magic never came back .
she feels helpless .
i reached out to all my contacts ,
knowing they &apos;d show up sooner or later .
i owed &apos; em that much .
then i left .
because as sad as it is , this isn &apos;t my fight .
and if i &apos;m ever going to be happy ,
i have to recognize which ones are .
it was three months before we heard the first rumor ...
... a string of missing persons on the west coast .
it was encouraging .
but then the numbers kept growing .
20 , 50 , 60 people missing .
it &apos;s them . i know it .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with them ,
or what they &apos;re doing , or why ...
but i promise you , we &apos;ll get him back .
just know that whatever happens between now and then ...
... it &apos;s not his fault .
there you are .
aw , did you miss me ?
never gets old , does it ?
it sure as hell hasn &apos;t yet .
