you have got to try this cheesecake .
you know , i &apos;m not that much of a sweet tooth ...
oh , my god , it &apos;s so creamy !
that &apos;s the best cheesecake i &apos;ve ever had !
where did you get this ?
it was at the front door when i got home . somebody sent it to us .
this isn &apos;t addressed to you .
this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs !
thief !
i didn &apos;t read the box before i opened it ...
... and you can &apos;t return a box after you opened it !
why not ?
because it &apos;s too delicious !
you stole this cheesecake . that &apos;s wrong .
no , it &apos;ll be okay because mrs. braverman will send for a free one .
that way , we all win .
the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ...
... &quot; mama &apos;s little bakery . &quot;
i feel terrible .
i &apos;m a horrible , horrible person .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
the one with all the cheesecakes
i should get going . big day at work .
you know how i &apos;m in a coma ?
today they do a test on me and it turns out i &apos;m not brain @-@ dead .
so ...
mr. smarty pants .
it &apos;s just my character that &apos;s not brain @-@ dead .
pheebs , still on for tonight ?
absolutely .
i &apos;ll see you at 8 .
what &apos;s at 8 ?
dinner . we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you .
wow ! did not know that .
may i say how lovely you look today ?
duly noted .
so for tomorrow , do you want to rent a car and drive down together ?
what are you talking about ?
cousin frannie &apos;s wedding .
you were invited ?
no .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe this .
i thought only mom and dad were invited .
from the ages of 7 to 9 , frannie and i were inseparable .
maybe since the age of 9 , frannie &apos;s made some new friends .
do you wanna make some new friends ?
it &apos;s probably just a mistake . let me call aunt cheryl .
maybe you are invited and the invitation got lost in the mail .
you call her and tell her that when we were kids ...
... her precious frannie tried to undress me several times .
if i hadrt stopped her , there wouldn &apos;t be a wedding to go to .
she tried to undress me too .
i used to undress my cousin glenn .
joseph francis tribbiani , are you home yet ?
i think he &apos;s still out . what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ll tell you , rachel karen greene .
i had plans with joey , and he left me this note .
&quot; pheebs , can &apos;t make it . got a date . talk to you later .
big daddy . &quot;
&quot; big daddy &quot; ?
that &apos;s a nickname we were trying .
why didn &apos;t you guys try &quot; francis &quot; ?
francis is a cooler name than chandler , isn &apos;t it ?
you know what nickname never caught on ? &quot; the ross @-@ a @-@ tron . &quot;
here &apos;s joseph francis !
wait , what are you middle @-@ naming me for ?
i left you a note .
that doesn &apos;t give you the right to ditch me !
you can cancel plans with friends if there &apos;s a possibility for sex .
he &apos;s right . that is the rule .
really ?
well , that &apos;s what i hear .
i &apos;ve never gotten a chance to actually employ the rule .
i don &apos;t accept it . when we make plans , i expect you to show up .
i &apos;m not a way to kill time till you meet someone better .
boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go , but this is for life .
i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea it would bother you this much .
well , it does .
well , can i make it up to you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
how about dinner tomorrow night ? i &apos;ll pay for myself .
okay , you wore me down .
while you &apos;re over there , how about a beer for &quot; the ross @-@ a @-@ tron &quot; ?
&quot; ross ... &quot; is that back ?
the other cheesecake came .
they delivered it here again .
just bring it downstairs . what &apos;s the problem ?
i can &apos;t seem to say goodbye .
are you serious ?
we ate an entire cake two days ago and you want more ?
well , i &apos;ve forgotten what it tastes like .
it was cheesecake . it was fine .
it had a buttery , crumbly , graham cracker crust ...
... with a very rich ...
... yet light cream cheese filling .
wow , my whole mouth just filled with saliva .
know what ? forget it . we &apos;re just hungry .
we haven &apos;t had lunch . we &apos;re just lightheaded .
so let &apos;s go have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .
we &apos;ll drop it off so we &apos;re not tempted .
where do you want to eat ?
mama &apos;s little bakery , chicago .
mel torme died .
joey , that paper &apos;s like a year old .
does that mean the sam goody &apos;s sale is over ?
so i finally heard back from aunt cheryl ...
... and apparently it wasn &apos;t a mistake .
there &apos;s limited seating ...
limited seating ? i am just one tiny person !
yeah , but she doesn &apos;t know that .
i mean , the last time she saw you ...
... you &apos;d have turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling .
&quot; limited seating . &quot; that &apos;s such a lame excuse .
that &apos;s not the reason she &apos;s not inviting me .
what &apos;s the big deal ? i wasn &apos;t invited to the ceremony , just the reception .
if it makes you feel any better , joan and i will just make an appearance ...
... and then we &apos;ll leave early as a sign of protest .
joan ?
yeah , my date .
assistant professor in linguistics . tall , very beautiful .
and despite what some people say , not broad @-@ backed .
wait a minute . you got &quot; ross geller and guest &quot; ?
i wasn &apos;t invited , and you got &quot; and guest &quot; ?
excuse me , i do have to interrupt on ross &apos; behalf .
i think the rule applies here .
since he has a chance to get on broad @-@ back ...
not broad @-@ back !
dude , i &apos;ve seen her . she &apos;s like a billboard .
wait a minute . you &apos;re bringing me .
i can &apos;t cancel on joan .
why not ?
did you not hear me ?
she &apos;s an assistant professor in the linguistics department .
they &apos;re wild .
why do you want to come anyway ?
because ...
... she &apos;s my cousin .
i mean , we grew up together .
family , you know ? and all that &apos;s important to me .
okay , all right . i &apos;ll take you .
i &apos;ll go call joan .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
family should be there .
it &apos;s her wedding . happiest day of her life .
we &apos;ll see .
well , thank you for lunch .
wait , i thought you paid .
apparently , we don &apos;t pay for food anymore .
do you see what i see ?
it &apos;s still there .
mrs. braverman must be out .
she could be out of town . maybe gone for months .
by then , it may spoil . she can &apos;t come back to bad cheesecake .
it could kill her .
don &apos;t want that .
we &apos;re protecting her .
we &apos;ll take it .
but quick .
why ?
i hear her in there .
go ! go ! go !
do you think it &apos;s inappropriate to wear a white , lacy dress to a wedding ?
yes .
excellent .
oh , my god , that &apos;s david .
who ?
david , the scientist guy .
david that i was in love with .
who went to russia and broke my heart , david .
oh , my god !
say their name enough , they turn around .
phoebe .
david .
what are you doing ? aren &apos;t you supposed to be in russia ?
i &apos;m just in town for a conference .
god , you look phenomenal .
well ...
yeah .
you look great too . did you get a haircut ?
yeah . well , i got like 30 of them .
look , i got a confession to make .
i was hoping to run into you here .
i didn &apos;t know if i should call . i was only in town a few days ...
... and i didn &apos;t want to intrude on your life .
i really wanted to see you ...
... but i didn &apos;t know if you wanted to see me .
of course i would want to see you . i think about you all the time .
really ? because i think about you all the time .
there &apos;s a statue in minsk that reminds me of you so much .
it &apos;s actually of lenin ...
... but , you know , at certain angles ...
anyway , do you want to have dinner tonight ?
yes .
oh , no !
what ?
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t believe i have plans . can you do it tomorrow ?
no , i have to go in a few hours . i have to be on the redeye .
listen , next time you &apos;re in minsk ...
phoebe ? can i talk to you for a second ?
what are you doing ?
i have plans with joey .
so ? he &apos;ll understand .
no , he won &apos;t . and that &apos;s not even the point .
i made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends .
and now just because , potentially , the love of my life ...
... returns from russia for one night ...
... i should change my beliefs ?
i should change my beliefs !
no . if i don &apos;t have my principles , i don &apos;t have anything .
you &apos;re so strong .
or i should rush through dinner with joey and meet david at 9 .
oh , my god , that is so good !
i &apos;m full . and yet i know if i stop eating this ...
... l &apos;ll regret it .
hey , what have you got there ?
oh , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s tofu cake . want some ?
what are you doing tonight ?
dude . dude .
sorry .
i got plans with phoebe .
really ? monica said she had a date at 9 .
what ? tonight ?
that &apos;s what monica said .
after that speech , she makes a date on the same night she has plans with me ?
she &apos;s trying to pull a fast one on big daddy .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
dude , dude !
if i took off my pants right now , how would you feel ?
like your cousin glenn .
here , i think this is us .
limited seating , my ass .
let &apos;s see who made the cut .
hi . i &apos;m monica geller .
how do you know the bride and groom ?
i worked with frannie .
used to work with her . used to .
i &apos;m a relative and i didn &apos;t get invited .
a blood relative . blood .
stop saying &quot; blood &quot; to strangers .
from the ages of 7 to 9 , we were inseparable , and i didn &apos;t even get invited !
then why are you here ?
i &apos;m my brother &apos;s date .
hey , i had a date , okay ?
joan tedeschi , the linguist .
so how about you ? how do you know the happy couple ?
we went to college with both of them .
now we live next door .
okay , you &apos;re fine .
you know , you would &apos;ve liked joan , she &apos;s very pleasant .
there ! there ! her back looks like that.that &apos;s not broad , is it ?
come on , joey , you &apos;ve got to be ready to order by now .
you know , i don &apos;t i like this table either . maybe we should move again .
no , we &apos;re staying right here . excuse me , we &apos;re ready to order .
i don &apos;t work here .
well , then you shouldn &apos;t be walking around .
are you guys ready ?
yes .
i &apos;ll have a green salad , house dressing and water &apos;s fine .
and for you , sir ?
yeah . this slow @-@ roasted salmon ...
... how slow are we talking ?
it &apos;s already been roasted .
oh , then no . maybe i should hear the specials again .
we &apos;ve heard the specials three times .
there &apos;s prime rib , mahi @-@ mahi and a very special lobster ravioli .
actually , we &apos;re out of the ravioli .
well , that changes everything !
you know what , pheebs ? you were right before .
friends are so important .
yeah , i &apos;m very wise . i know .
know what i really want ?
what ?
is to have a long , long talk .
you know ? get joey out on the open road and really open him up .
any progress ?
yes .
i will have the lobster ravioli .
god , joey , this is taking forever .
what &apos;s the rush ?
well ...
... i have an appointment .
and it &apos;s very important .
what is it ?
well ...
... it &apos;s a date .
a date ?
no , you must be mistaken , because you wouldn &apos;t have a date ...
... on the same night you have plans with a friend .
don &apos;t make me feel badly .
no , i &apos;m gonna !
you made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl .
like i did something terrible . now you &apos;re doing the same thing .
it &apos;s not ! it &apos;s totally different !
this is with david . remember david , the scientist guy ?
he &apos;s very special to me .
my girl the other night was special . she was a scientist too .
she was ?
well , she graduated high school .
whatever . know what ?
he &apos;s only here for four hours and i &apos;m gonna go see him .
fine !
yeah .
what are you still doing here ? i told you , lobster ravioli !
i was about to leave . i didn &apos;t think you were coming .
i wouldn &apos;t have missed this .
well , i &apos;m very glad you &apos;re here .
oh , you &apos;re such a gentleman .
come on , we &apos;re going to my place .
are you eating the cheesecake without me ?
i will give you $ 100 to whistle right now .
how can you eat it without me ?
what &apos;ll you do ?
tell monica or joey ? no , you &apos;d have to tell them everything .
we &apos;re dessert stealers . we &apos;re living outside the law .
i don &apos;t trust you with this cake .
i got it first , and i &apos;m taking it back !
what ? oh , no .
oh , yes .
you think i trust you with it ?
no , we &apos;ll split it .
that &apos;s not fair . you had some .
i think monica would be very interested to know ...
... that you called her cheesecake &quot; dry and mealy . &quot;
what do we use to split it ?
all right , pick a half .
well , this side looks bigger .
but there &apos;s more crust on this side .
maybe if i measure it ...
pick a piece !
all right , i pick that one .
it &apos;s the smaller piece .
okay . there you go .
enjoy your half , my friend . but that is it .
no sharing , no switching , and don &apos;t come crying to me ...
... if you eat your piece too fast .
you gonna give me some of yours ?
oh , no .
no switching , no sharing . and don &apos;t come crying to me .
i may just sit here and have my cake all day .
just sit here in the hallway and eat my ...
ross , sweetheart !
oh , hey , aunt millie .
isn &apos;t it a beautiful wedding ?
yes , it is .
every time , on the lips !
why ? why on the lips ?
there &apos;s frannie . wort she be happy to see me ?
you be nice , all right ?
i didn &apos;t bring you to ambush her .
frannie was the one who showed your playboys to mom .
that bitch .
monica !
what ... ?
am i doing here ? surprised to see me ?
ross brought me . how do you like that ?
hi , frannie . congratulations .
you invite my whole family , and not me ? why ?
why wouldn &apos;t you want me here ? what could i have done ?
stuart !
i believe you know my husband .
so it &apos;s really a question of &quot; who &quot; could you have done .
i hate this , but i have to go .
i can &apos;t miss my flight .
i bet there &apos;s another flight to minsk in ...
july .
that &apos;s really beautiful . what does it mean ?
&quot; please clean my beakers . &quot;
i don &apos;t get out of the lab much .
i thought it meant something else .
yeah , well , i really actually wanted to say ...
... that .
but i figured i probably shouldn &apos;t because ...
... i have to leave .
no , you &apos;re right . don &apos;t say it .
i do , though .
i do too .
well , bye , phoebe .
now &apos;s not the time , joey . you can yell at me tomorrow .
wait , no , pheebs . i &apos;m not gonna yell at you .
i just started thinking about you and david ...
... and i remember how bummed you were the first time he left .
oh , pheebs , come here .
are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay .
the only guy i &apos;ve ever been crazy about is going to minsk ...
... and i may never see him again .
you could always visit him .
right . like they &apos;ll let me have a passport .
anything i can do ? whatever you need .
well , now ...
... if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does ...
... then he could come back .
i could give it a shot .
oh , look ! there &apos;s a piece that doesn &apos;t have floor on it .
stick to your side !
come on , now !
all right , what are we having ?
oh , wait , i forgot my wrap .
oh , i &apos;ll wait here for you .
i can &apos;t go back there !
why ?
did you see the way stuart was staring at me ? i think he still wants me .
oh , my god .
just go do it !
all right , wait here .
hi , sweetie ! are you leaving ?
well ...
give us a kiss . come on .
