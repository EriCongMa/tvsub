desperate housewives s07 e16
i don &apos;t feel well .
susan &apos;s health took a turn for the worse .
someone call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
you have given me so much , keith .
one relationship came to a bittersweet end .
i know who you are . get out !
forgive me , please .
please ! i love you .
no , you don &apos;t .
and another ended in betrayal .
the suburbs are full of parents ,
and each parent has their own style .
there &apos;s the disciplinarian ...
the smotherer ...
and the negotiator ...
but the one thing they all have in common ...
is they love to judge the parents next door .
take your sister inside , sweetie .
i need to have a little chat with lee .
hi ! i see jenny &apos;s practicing again .
two hours a day , five days a week .
wow . she is really into that violin .
sometimes . mostly i have to force her to do it .
ohh . big mistake .
really ? seems like you have an unsolicited opinion .
look , i know you &apos;re new to this parenting thing ,
so i &apos;m gonna tell you how it works--
you can &apos;t force a kid to do stuff ,
&apos;cause then it just leads to a lot of door slamming
and name @-@ calling , and then the kid gets angry , too .
well , here &apos;s the way i think it works--
jenny told us she wants to play the violin ,
so it &apos;s my job to make sure she sticks with it .
by pushing her .
i &apos;m not pushing her .
what ? she wanted to learn mandarin .
look , i don &apos;t mean to
devalue the two and a half weeks you &apos;ve had as a father .
i &apos;m simply telling you what works .
so let me ask you--what &apos;s juanita pursuing on her own ?
huh ?
as you know , the school talent show is coming up .
jenny &apos;s playing the violin . what &apos;s juanita going to do ?
well , that &apos;s hard to say .
see , the beauty of my method
is that juanita has explored so many ... things ,
it &apos;s hard to know which one to showcase .
well , this should be interesting--
two different parenting philosophies
and a talent show to prove which one of us is right ...
in front of hundreds of people .
yes . will it be the overbearing , hypercritical father ...
or the loving mom who still looks hot in these sweats ?
game on .
hey , sweetie , i heard the talent show &apos;s coming up .
what are you gonna do ?
oh , it &apos;s going to be great . watch .
yes , each parent has their own style .
but deep down ,
they &apos;re all afraid they &apos;re doing it wrong .
there are many things that bring us pleasure--
baking for our friends ...
having a good laugh ...
donating to charity .
but the things that bring us pleasure
may not be enough to give our lives meaning ...
without someone to love .
morning , dear . just back from the store .
what the hell ?
i thought for dinner i could make those lamb chops ,
you love so much .
i got a great tip from the butcher on searing the meat first .
i kicked you out of this house .
oh , dear . you &apos;re still angry with me .
but you know , paul , every couple has their fights .
and i &apos;ll admit , ours was a doozy .
that wasn &apos;t a fight . that was the end .
y @-@ you don &apos;t mean that . you &apos;re just upset .
but don &apos;t worry .
we will get past this .
are you out of your mind ?
you actually think i would take you back ?
wait . i get it .
this is another ploy cooked up by your sick mother .
my mother .
yes .
she &apos;s the one you &apos;re mad at .
it &apos;s all her fault .
she told me you were a monster who killed aunt martha .
but then i fell in love with you .
and i realized ...
you never could have done such a thing .
it was all a lie .
oh , beth . that was no lie .
you don &apos;t mean ...
my god .
now we both feel betrayed .
painful , isn &apos;t it ?
you know what this is ?
uh , a closet ?
no . it &apos;s a graveyard--
a graveyard filled with all the stuff we bought
because you told us you wanted to do something
and then quit .
remember this ?
remember how you begged us to buy you a guitar ?
the strings hurt my fingers .
what about this ?
very expensive . you &apos;ve never touched it .
that &apos;s not true .
i use it to pretend i &apos;m playing guitar .
juanita , you are full of ideas ,
but you never see any of them through .
well , guess what ?
you are doing one of these things at that talent show .
but i &apos;m already doing something .
not that .
fine . if you won &apos;t pick something , i will .
tap .
no .
yes .
you enjoyed it . you actually set your personal record
for sticking with something-- two months !
but it &apos;s hard .
let me tell you something about life--
anything that &apos;s worth doing is hard .
that &apos;s what life is ?
you &apos;re going back to that tap class ,
and you &apos;re gonna practice two hours a day ,
seven days a week until you nail it .
no , i &apos;ll do something else at the show .
like what ?
i &apos;ll tell jokes .
a jewish guy and a mexican walk into a bar--
no .
thank you , bree .
it always brightens my day when you invite me to visit .
well , reverend sykes , i very much enjoy your company .
as i do yours .
so ... have you killed someone ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;ve always found the treats you prepare for my visits
are a reliable indicator of your level of spiritual turmoil .
the more exquisite the baked goods ,
the more anguished your soul . this ...
is a hazelnut chocolate chip scone with currants .
so i ask again-- have you killed someone ?
no . it &apos;s just ...
lately i feel like job .
you know , job , from the old testament ?
i &apos;m familiar with the book , thank you .
why do you think you &apos;re job ?
i just feel that god has taken everything away from me .
i lost my business , my children never call me ,
and ... my boyfriend keith has left me .
well , it &apos;s not exactly body boils and dead camels ,
but i understand what you &apos;re saying .
when i complained
after i was not accepted into yale divinity school ,
my father had no sympathy .
instead , he drove me from our lovely home in connecticut
to a dangerous section of the bronx
and forced me to hand out blankets to the homeless .
i see . that &apos;s the reason you &apos;ve always been
so sensitive to the plight of the poor .
perhaps .
it &apos;s certainly the reason my father was buried
in a sport jacket he detested .
the point is , looking at what has been taken from us
is a bad way to go through life .
looking for what we can give to others is far better .
could you pass me the tape ?
i &apos;m so glad i asked you to help .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m feeling a little faint .
what is that smell ?
it &apos;s like sneakers mixed with cologne
mixed with &quot; i ran around the block
four times wearing a shirt made of cheese . &quot;
that &apos;s porter and preston .
well , get the place cleaned .
yeah . i think i &apos;m gonna hold off on that for a while .
why ?
because ...
i kind of love this smell .
okay , now you &apos;re becoming delirious .
we &apos;ve gotta get you out of here .
hey , you don &apos;t have children ,
so you don &apos;t get it .
but raising kids is an amazing experience .
it is the most meaningful thing i &apos;ve ever done .
so anything that reminds me of them is a good thing .
you must be pretty sad they &apos;re gone .
no .
no , it &apos;s right .
they &apos;re moving on with their lives .
it &apos;s wonderful .
then why are there tears in your eyes ?
um ... that &apos;s the smell .
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s get outta here .
so ... any idea what &apos;s going on with me ?
as much as i enjoy passing out at restaurants ,
i &apos;m starting to get a little concerned .
according to these tests , your creatine levels are increasing .
that &apos;s not good . oh .
why is that happening ?
i realize this isn &apos;t a satisfying answer , but ...
we don &apos;t know .
so , uh ...
how serious is it ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i tell all my patients--
we are going to do everything we can to get you a kidney .
but in the meantime , live your life .
if there &apos;s things you &apos;re thinking about doing ...
do them now .
i think for our anniversary we should have a picnic ...
in the woods ...
where we got married .
sure .
that &apos;s a great idea .
i think we should do it now .
but our anniversary &apos;s not till july .
were we not at the same appointment just now ?
i thought that dialysis was supposed to keep you healthy .
i guess it &apos;s just not working for me .
how bad is this ?
pretty bad .
yesterday , the doctor &apos;s secretary
handed me this free parking pass with this ... sad look .
it was like ,
&quot; yeah , you &apos;re doomed , but your parking &apos;s free . &quot;
so is this pass good for a month ? a week ?
gaby !
i just wanna know what we &apos;re facing here .
all i know is ... i need a new kidney ,
and there &apos;s nothing i can do till they find me one .
well , have you thought about trying to find a donor yourself ?
so far , you &apos;ve only asked family .
yeah , widen the circle . ask friends and neighbors .
well , there &apos;s not much point .
i mean , finding a match is like 1 in 1,000 .
so ask a thousand people .
yes . we can help .
we can canvass the neighborhood ,
put up signs , go door to door .
guys , it &apos;s a vital organ .
susan , people care about you .
you might be surprised what they &apos;re willing to do .
i appreciate the thought ,
but i just can &apos;t ask anyone
to make that kind of sacrifice for me .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna get you more coffee .
maybe she can &apos;t .
but i can .
donate a kidney ?
have we met ? i &apos;m like 112 .
but , karen ,
it &apos;s for our dear friend susan .
i &apos;m not having elective surgery .
i take enough risk just climbing out of the tub .
i don &apos;t know . aren &apos;t there serious risks ?
actually , the mortality rate is quite low .
i meant the scarring .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time
at the gym working off my love handles ,
and i will not give up a chance to go shirtless .
no .
but i--
no .
she &apos;s really--
no .
would you ju--
no .
bree ...
yes ?
no .
i want a baby .
here . i also have a 9 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of my own .
preferably a boy ...
and in brown .
wait . you &apos;re serious ?
where did you get this incredibly rash and not @-@ thought @-@ out idea ?
from you .
you know what you said yesterday
about kids giving your life meaning ? i want that .
i want ... meaning .
in the form of a baby ?
exactly .
i already made an appointment with an adoption agency ,
which was right next door to my manicurist .
it was like it was meant to be .
are you sure about this ?
i mean , your social calendar is very full .
a baby would change all that .
it requires a lot of sacrifice and compromise .
maybe the way you do it .
excuse me ?
you work your life around your kids .
i intend to work my child into my life .
no offense , but i think
you make it a lot harder than it has to be .
you know what ?
you might be right .
but before you commit to being a mom ,
why don &apos;t you give it a test drive ?
what do you mean ?
you could watch paige some night .
tom and i am out in a while .
really ? you &apos;d let me babysit ?
yeah !
which one is paige ?
this one .
i accept . wow .
my first step toward being a mom .
oh , you watch . i am gonna be a natural .
oh , uh , does she eat shellfish ?
maybe .
so i got us caviar ,
shrimp paste smoked salmon .
if there &apos;s a part of a fish they can overcharge for ,
we have it .
can you put these in the back ? thanks .
sweetie ?
yeah ?
i just want to thank you for doing this today .
you &apos;re welcome .
and you can thank me again when we go back in july
for our real anniversary .
and i &apos;d really love if , for the next eight hours ,
i &apos;m not sick . no talk of kidneys .
let &apos;s just have a fun , normal day , okay ?
you got it .
one fun , normal day in the woods , coming up .
nothing &apos;s gonna ruin this trip .
hey . how was tap class ?
it &apos;s too hard . i don &apos;t wanna do it anymore .
oh , sweetie ...
you &apos;re doing it . we &apos;re not a family of quitters .
ugh ! you quit all the time .
yesterday we played hide @-@ and @-@ seek .
celia and i looked for you for an hour
before we saw your car was gone .
so i found a great hiding place .
it &apos;s not quitting .
all right , look , let me ask you something--
are you getting better ?
i guess .
well , there you go .
now go upstairs and change .
oh , and remember , tomorrow &apos;s lesson &apos;s two hours .
you &apos;re gonna make my feet fall off .
i can &apos;t wait for this to be over .
why are you working her so hard ?
it &apos;s a lousy school talent show .
you think bob and lee are going easy on their kid ?
no ! they push her .
that girl &apos;s so good at the violin ,
she &apos;s practically asian .
so that &apos;s what this is about .
you &apos;re competing with bob and lee .
pfft . that &apos;s ridiculous . this is about juanita .
i &apos;m building her self @-@ esteem
and giving her a chance to shine .
and if a couple of same @-@ sex parents
end up crying at home in their silk kimonos ,
so be it .
oh , mike , look at this place .
isn &apos;t it as beautiful as you remember it ?
yeah . lucky i didn &apos;t leave it on the roof of the car .
ugh . will you forget about the picnic basket ?
i guess you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s important is we &apos;re together .
and there &apos;s no--
damn it ! they forgot the fries ! unbelievable .
okay , mike , look at me .
think back eight years ,
when we stood in this spot
and we pledged our love to each other .
oh ! i know .
let &apos;s renew our vows .
that &apos;s a great idea .
i , mike delfino ,
promise to love--
i , mike delfino , promise to--
it &apos;s just a bird . forget it .
promise to love and honor--
okay . now he &apos;s just mocking me .
mike !
mike , stop !
oh , my god .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe you hit that bird .
yeah , i know .
i was aiming for that one .
as the gayest person at this brunch ,
i feel it is my duty to say ...
&quot; fabulous . &quot;
yeah , bree , what &apos;s the occasion ?
oh , nothing , just a little get @-@ together for friends .
smoked salmon tartare cornucopia ?
this feels weird . she &apos;s up to somethin &apos; .
oh , what are you talking about ? it &apos;s just a brunch .
excuse me . if i could borrow a moment of your time
for a brief presentation .
oh , god , you &apos;re right . it &apos;s an ambush .
it seems many of you have some misguided ideas
about kidney donation , so i have invited craig lynwood ,
transplant coordinator at fairview memorial
to dispel some of those myths .
mr. lynwood , is it true there &apos;s an age limit to donating ?
no , not necessarily .
and does the surgery cause unsightly scarring ?
it &apos;s laparoscopic . the scarring is minimal .
well , i don &apos;t know about the rest of you ,
but i find that very reassuring .
so now that we have the facts ,
i am sure you &apos;ll all want to get tested .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll go in next week .
no need .
nurse dearborn ?
so the line forms over here .
and we won &apos;t take no for an answer .
you &apos;re gonna get tested ?
no . i think i can take gaby .
i don &apos;t know how paul found out ,
mama , but he did .
and then ... well ...
he threw me out .
he was just ... so cold .
what a sad story .
if only someone had warned you what a bastard he is .
i know . you were right all along .
i should have listened to you .
but i &apos;m going to make it up to you .
oh , beth .
i can &apos;t allow you back in my life .
you have failed me in every possible way .
no . i didn &apos;t .
paul confessed .
really ?
did you get it on tape ?
did he write it on a napkin ?
of course not .
because you have never done anything right
in your life .
give me another chance . i &apos;ll do anything .
i have no more use for you . good @-@ bye .
wait !
i have nowhere to go .
what &apos;s going to happen to me , mama ?
you &apos;re going to live a lonely , depressing life
in some ratty apartment with plenty of time to think
about all the people you disappointed--
most of all ... me .
guard , i &apos;m done here .
take her off the visitor &apos;s list .
the oakridge school talent show
will start in five minutes .
so ... checking out fairview &apos;s answer to itzhak perlman ?
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
but if it &apos;s german for &quot; cat strangler , &quot;
then yes .
it &apos;s like that , is it ?
so when &apos;s your daughter start stomping off to buffalo ?
she &apos;s on right before jenny . so you might want to keep
your sunglasses handy ,
because juanita is going to be dazzling .
honey ! are you okay ? were you being chased by a bee ?
no , it &apos;s my routine .
that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve nailed the finale .
oh , that--that was you nailing it ?
to the floor . bam .
performers to the stage .
where are my tap shoes ?
i don &apos;t know .
i left them right here .
oh , honey . i guess you lost &apos; em ,
and the show &apos;s about to start .
dang it !
i can &apos;t believe this . i was so excited .
i worked so hard .
i &apos;m sorry . you want to stay and watch your friends ?
we can go after for ice cream .
who cares ?
i will see your shirt
and i will raise you one bra .
nicely played .
do you hear something ?
hmm . probably just a peeping raccoon .
no . no , i think there &apos;s someone out there .
this way ! there they are !
what the hell ?
i got him !
identify yourselves .
are you northern agitators ?
do we look like northern agitators ?
w @-@ we &apos;re just celebrating our anniversary .
you guys ...
playing paintball or something ?
no , madam , we are not playing .
i am major general jedediah garrett .
of the confederate army , and we are--
kevin--kevin--kevin . hi . hi .
uh , we &apos;re part of a civil war reenactment group .
yeah , i know , i know .
get a real life , right ?
can &apos;t you guys just have your pretend war over there ?
pretend ?
you , sir , are interrupting the battle of fredericksburg .
actually , we have the entire park until 6 : 00 .
kyle , show &apos; em the permit .
i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s fine . we believe you .
no , it &apos;s not fine . this is really important to her .
just give us a couple hours .
no , sir . now begone !
men , we must be ready to attack
the enemy should they attempt to retreat into maryland .
what a douche .
a douche , you say ?
yeah .
mike ! let &apos;s just go .
eyes closed , kyle . you &apos;re supposed to be dead .
i died with my eyes open . it happens .
close &apos; em , kyle .
and now to close our show
is a violin solo
by jenny hunter mcdermott .
she lives next door to me .
we &apos;re getting those double @-@ paned windows .
ouch !
poor lee . he must be pretty embarrassed .
does he look embarrassed ?
she always stumbles over that part .
she really stumbled over it today .
but she powered through it . we couldn &apos;t be prouder .
wait ! wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! nobody move !
okay , don &apos;t leave yet .
there &apos;s still , uh , one girl who hasn &apos;t performed yet .
but i lost my tap shoes .
oh , that &apos;s right . oh ... oh , hey ! wait !
is that them in the back room , behind the radiator ?
whoo ! bravo !
oh , look , we had a great day .
think of it this way ...
now we have a funny story to tell people .
two funny stories ?
hello ?
bree , it &apos;s craig lynwood .
i have some great news .
all your efforts have paid off .
you found a match ?
we found two .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s a miracle . who are they ?
well , one of them is you .
bree ? are you there ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , uh ...
i ... i wasn &apos;t expecting this . um ...
who &apos;s the other one ?
woman named beth young .
beth ? i didn &apos;t even know she got tested .
apparently she saw one of your flyers .
and she wants to do this ?
well , i don &apos;t know yet .
we &apos;re having a hard time getting in touch with her .
so ... should we continue to look for this beth young ,
or is the donor going to be you ?
fancy . i thought we were just gonna grab a burger .
renee was really talking this place up ,
so i thought we could splurge .
or we could stay home and eat money .
we better order . any second ,
my phone is going to ring ,
and renee is gonna beg me to rush home and get paige .
i don &apos;t know . she might surprise you .
oh , great .
one night out and we have to listen to that .
who brings a baby to a place like this ?
hey . let &apos;s give the parents that dirty look
that we always get , like , &quot; huh . &quot;
yeah .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s renee ...
on a date ...
with our baby .
unbelievable .
and you thought she &apos;d be good at this ?
ohh , look at that .
what ? what is she doing now ?
nothing . the filet mignon just went by .
it looks amazing .
s @-@ so should we just go over and get paige ?
not yet .
i want to watch .
look , look , there you go .
she &apos;s probably ordering milk for paige .
or she &apos;s giving our baby away .
wow . she really is bad at this .
excuse me .
oh , hi . i &apos;ll be right over to take your order .
why did that woman give you this baby ?
she gave me $ 100 to see if i could calm her down ...
but i don &apos;t mind .
i love children . i &apos;m actually expecting my third .
really ? that &apos;s beautiful .
listen , how would you like to make ...
are you ready to order ?
uh ... have you forgotten something ?
oh , your drinks will be right out .
no , no . not the drinks . the baby .
i gave you a baby . where is it ?
oh , i had orders backing up ,
so i gave it to a busboy .
what ? what busboy ?
um ... he should be here somewhere .
oh , i hope he didn &apos;t finish his shift and go home .
you better find me that baby .
or i &apos;m gonna take that one now !
uh , hey , busboy . are you the one that has a baby ?
i &apos;m looking for a baby--
2 feet tall , big head , drools .
i &apos;m looking for ... a baby .
um ... did anyone pass you a baby ?
has anyone seen a baby ? !
had enough ?
in a minute .
that vein in her head is really going .
do you know where there &apos;s a baby ?
because they gave it to me .
i don &apos;t know where the baby is !
lynette ...
and paige . how ... did you get paige ?
what are you doing with paige ?
you took our baby on a date .
well ... brian called . it was his one night in town .
well , then you say ,
&quot; sorry , brian , i can &apos;t make it tonight . &quot;
that &apos;s what being a mother is about--
making sacrifices , something you know absolutely nothing about .
ugh ! come on , tom .
beth ? it &apos;s bree van de kamp .
coming .
i , uh , went to your house . paul told me you were here .
we aren &apos;t together anymore .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it is what it is .
thanks ...
for checking on me .
well , actually , the reason i came by ...
has the gentleman from the transplant office
reached you ?
why ?
am i a match ?
yes .
wow .
so ... what do i do now ?
is there someone i need to call ? are there forms ?
well , that won &apos;t be necessary , because i &apos;m a match , too .
what ?
i know .
two in the same neighborhood .
we &apos;re very blessed .
anyway , i , uh , am going to be susan &apos;s donor ,
but i wanted to thank you for ...
getting tested .
when you moved onto the lane , i didn &apos;t give you a chance .
i saw you as a woman who married a man i hated ,
and i see now that you &apos;re so much more than that .
i &apos;m sorry it took me so long to realize it .
well , i ...
i should go .
i want to do it .
beth , no--
please , bree .
let me help susan .
it would really mean a lot to me .
beth , what i &apos;m about to say may not make sense to you ,
but , um ...
i &apos;ve been going through , uh ... a dark time ...
feeling alone and unconnected
and wondering if i have a purpose ,
so for me to be able to do this for my friend ...
it may mean a lot to you ...
but it means everything to me .
thank you for understanding .
sorry about last night .
i bought this for the baby .
expensive , fragile , pointy ...
if only it were flammable .
i &apos;m not really cut out to be a mother , am i ?
no .
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
it &apos;s not for everyone .
what &apos;s sad is how many people go ahead
and have kids anyway .
well , what do people do to fill up the hole in their lives ?
no matter what i do , no matter who i &apos;m with , i ...
i feel alone .
you &apos;ll find something ,
and when you do ,
you &apos;ll be glad you have the room .
lots and lots of room .
thanks . mm . i &apos;m so glad i stopped by .
we &apos;re about to eat . why don &apos;t you join us ?
okay .
okay .
but keep the baby on your side of the table .
what ? i &apos;ll probably let her play with my knife .
ow ! son of a bitch !
let me look at it .
no .
you okay ?
mike , are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay . we never should have come here .
instead of waiting for our real anniversary ,
we wasted our time on this disaster .
is that why you &apos;re yelling at me ? &apos; cause i ...
&apos;cause i moved up our anniversary ?
because you &apos;re dying .
you &apos;re dying ,
and there &apos;s not a damn thing i can do about it .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but it ...
it feels like you &apos;re getting ready to say good @-@ bye ...
like you &apos;re bailing on me .
bailing ?
i am fighting .
i @-@ i am scared , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen ,
but i am fighting my ass off .
i want to see m.j. graduate .
i want to grow old with you .
i want all of that .
but in the meantime , i ...
i am gonna enjoy every ...
every moment of every day .
let &apos;s get outta here .
hey . lean on me .
i &apos;m a lot stronger than you think .
our lives are brief .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important to search for meaning .
we find it in our daughter &apos;s smile ...
in the warmth of our friends ...
or the comfort of our faith .
then there are those who make their lives meaningful
by making a great sacrifice .
hello . my name is beth young .
i &apos;m here to donate a kidney .
i just found out i &apos;m a match for a friend of mine .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am . you &apos;re in the wrong place .
you want the transplant office on the fourth floor .
these are my forms .
i think you &apos;ll see they &apos;re all completely filled out .
again , ma &apos;am , you want the transplant office .
this is emergency .
my friend &apos;s name is susan delfino .
it &apos;s funny . at first , we didn &apos;t get along very well .
actually , we never got along .
but that kind of thing seems so insignificant
when someone is in need .
that &apos;s great . fourth floor , elevator &apos;s down the hall .
i really don &apos;t mean to trouble you ,
but these forms have to get to the right place .
i don &apos;t want to mess this up .
it &apos;s the most important thing i &apos;ve ever done .
okay .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
thank you so much . you &apos;re very kind .
