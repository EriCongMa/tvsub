did you hear about this study that found people
that were cool and popular at 13
have problems succeeding later in life ?
i &apos;m doing okay , and i was very popular at 13 .
in school ?
oh , no . at home .
the servants would sing to me ,
laugh at my jokes ...
i wish i knew their names .
does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids ?
you tell me-- you woke up in bed with one .
listen to this .
i just received an e @-@ mail from wil wheaton .
leonard nimoy &apos;s son is working on a documentary
that he started with his father before he passed away .
it &apos;s about mr. spock and his impact on our culture .
是 《 星际旅行 》 中的史波克
why is he writing to you ?
well , they &apos;re looking for fans to interview ,
and wil thought i &apos;d be good for it .
oh . hey , high five .
absolutely not .
yeah , penny ,
you spent some time in front of the camera .
any words of advice ?
yes . don &apos;t take your shirt off
just because the director said so .
this is a documentary about mr. spock .
i &apos;m sure if there &apos;s nudity , it will be tasteful .
hey . you got a minute ?
not really .
visigoths are kind of up my butt right now .
pause the game , howard .
&quot; howard &quot; ? uh @-@ oh .
make room , visigoths .
&apos;sup ?
we need to talk about redecorating this place .
oh , no , not this again .
look , i get that you grew up here
and you &apos;re attached to things looking a certain way , but ...
i want this to feel like my house , too .
oh , honey , of course it &apos;s your house .
why else would you be cleaning it all the time ?
all right . let &apos;s start over .
i &apos;m redecorating .
the furniture , the carpeting , the walls .
i &apos;m changing everything that depresses me when i look at it .
try not to be one of those things .
may i say something ?
is it about how i can &apos;t have new wallpaper
&apos;cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died ?
never mind .
hello , amy . it &apos;s sheldon .
yeah , i @-@ i know that we &apos;re broken up ,
but i &apos;m leaving this message
because i thought perhaps you &apos;d like to watch me
be interviewed for a documentary about mr. spock .
or as i like to call it , a spockumentary .
yeah , i &apos;m going to use that joke in the interview ,
so try to laugh like you &apos;re hearing it for the first time .
you know , hysterically , hmm ?
and with a tinge of sadness that i &apos;m no longer in your life .
i &apos;m the one who thought of &quot; spockumentary &quot; &quot;
and i &apos;m laughing like i did the first time i heard it .
hello .
hey , sheldon .
this is adam nimoy .
nice to meet you .
oh , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i admire your father &apos;s work very much .
it &apos;s not every day i get to meet someone whose life &apos;s journey
began in my hero &apos;s scrotum .
i told you . this guy is gold .
whatcha doing ? oh !
making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me
after my dad left , but before she died .
okay , listen , i &apos;m thinking
that maybe we can compromise on the house .
i &apos;m listening .
let &apos;s just redo one room and see how it goes .
that is reasonable .
but what room ?
how &apos; bout this one ?
no way .
no way , this is the room i associate the most with my mom .
then how about the bathroom ?
i want to change my answer .
fine . then the dining room .
i guess we didn &apos;t use it very often .
unless we had company .
which didn &apos;t happen much after my dad left and not at all
after my mom ...
great ! i &apos;m gonna go pick out paint samples .
all right , we &apos;re just gonna have a conversation .
pretend the camera &apos;s not here .
all right . but this better not be some elaborate scheme
to get me out of my shirt .
how long have you known adam ?
a few years .
and what are you getting him back for ?
let &apos;s start with your name and occupation .
dr. sheldon cooper , theoretical physicist , caltech .
and what is your earliest memory of the character spock ?
the first episode of startrek : the original series i ever saw
was &quot; the galileo seven . &quot;
uh , spock had just landed on the planet taurus ii .
then my brother came in , sat on my head ,
and said , &quot; eat farts . &quot;
after that day , i was hooked .
on star trek ,
not my brother &apos;s sphincter @-@ based cuisine .
what was it about spock that appealed to you ?
i think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere ,
the dream of a cold , rational world
entirely without human emotion .
spock came from a planet governed only by logic .
you know , on vulcan , when your brother asks ,
&quot; why are you hitting yourself ? &quot;
the answer is , &quot; i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re moving my arm . &quot;
to which he says , &quot; fascinating . &quot;
and then you both watch educational television .
aw . when he says things like that ,
i just want to hug him and make everything better .
my brother was mean to me , too .
yeah , you probably had it coming .
do you have any spock collectibles ?
i have many .
my most treasured is an autographed napkin
given to me by my very thoughtful friend penny .
尼莫伊在2015年2月已去世
that &apos;s her over there .
hi !
look at that .
i &apos;m in a movie , my shirt stayed on .
can we see the napkin ?
of course . excuse me .
this will just take a moment .
when did we get a wall safe ?
when there was no more room in the floor safe .
when did we get a floor safe ?
when we got the security camera .
there &apos;s a security camera ?
aquaman , protecting your home since 2012 .
oh , my god . we &apos;ve done things on that couch .
yeah . you don &apos;t have to tell me .
so , your father @-@ in @-@ law is in there right now ?
yes . so back me up .
the house is good the way it is .
oh , okay . got it .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
hey . hey , raj .
dad and i were just talking about taking down this wall .
you sure ? it &apos;s a ... pretty great wall .
what &apos;s so great about it ?
i &apos;m sorry . i did what i could .
seriously ? you brought raj over to take your side ?
your dad &apos;s on your side .
he &apos;s not on my side . he &apos;s doing all the work for free .
that is so generous of you .
i &apos;d like to switch sides .
look , uh ...
i don &apos;t even think you can take this wall down
&apos;cause it &apos;s load @-@ bearing .
well , it &apos;s easy to find out .
just go into the crawlspace under the house and check .
when is your visa up ?
not only is it signed to me
but this is where he wiped his mouth .
so we are currently in the presence of leonard nimoy &apos;s dna .
um , doesn &apos;t adam count as leonard nimoy &apos;s dna ?
no offense , but this is pure 100 % nimoy .
because of your mother , you &apos;re only 50 % .
which isn &apos;t bad ,
but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away .
okay , enough about the napkin .
what else you hiding in there ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
i would .
all right then .
see ? just my valuables .
my passport , uh , my will ...
you have a will ?
yeah--
my 1 / 18 scale wil wheaton action figure .
i also have the other kind of will ,
and in it i will my wil back to wil .
will wil want it ?
wil won &apos;t .
what &apos;s that ring box ?
oh . that is an engagement ring
that i was going to give my girlfriend amy .
what ? !
you bought her a ring ?
no , no , no . this has been in my family for generations .
except for a short time when comanches cut off
my great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandmother &apos;s finger and stole it .
sheldon , that &apos;s awful .
no .
the texas rangers tracked them down to their village
and slaughtered every last one of them , so ...
it was a happy ending .
well , for my nine @-@ fingered nana .
okay , back to the ring . does amy even know about this ?
no . she broke up with me
before i could broach the subject .
oh , man , i &apos;m sorry-- that must have been devastating for you .
no , not at all . no , i &apos;m fine .
you know , amy had reservations about our relationship ,
so all worked out for the best .
i know . it just ...
i said i &apos;m fine !
we &apos;ve gotten a little off @-@ topic .
allow me to make things entertaining again
in this little spockumentary .
that was leonard &apos;s joke .
as a child , when faced with a dilemma ,
my mother encouraged me to ask , &quot; what would jesus do ? &quot;
the answer to that was always , &quot; love thy neighbor . &quot;
but my neighbor had a dead tooth , so ...
that wasn &apos;t going to happen .
but ...
that &apos;s why i changed it to , &quot; what would spock do ? &quot;
did you find that helpful ?
yes . oh , for example , three years ago
when i discovered penny was eating all my pop @-@ tarts ,
instead of getting angry or vindictive ,
you know , i got a floor safe .
i knew i could smell &apos; em .
what about from when you were a kid ?
oh , certainly . uh , when i was eight years old ,
billy sparks cornered me in the playground .
i asked myself , &quot; what would spock do ? &quot;
then i grabbed billy on his shoulder
and performed my first vulcan nerve pinch .
由伦纳德 · 尼莫伊本人亲自发明
did it work ?
oh , no-- he broke my collarbone .
i can still hear it click .
that must have been very upsetting for you .
oh , not at all .
as i said , the entire point of emulating spock
was to rise above human emotion ,
which i &apos;ve spent a lifetime mastering .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not here .
no . you went . what does mean ?
you did go .
all right , fine . well , sheldon , i &apos;m no expert ,
but aren &apos;t you completely missing the point of spock ?
i mean , he liked to act like he had no emotions ,
but he was still half human .
just like you .
i &apos;m just saying , you pretend you don &apos;t ,
but you have feelings just like everybody else .
not true . no , look at me .
i had an engagement ring to give a girl ,
and instead , she rejected me .
and am i emotional about that ? no .
no , i am sitting here on a couch ,
talking about my favorite tv character like nothing happened .
&apos;cause i am just like him :
all logical , all the time .
sweetie , you &apos;re yelling .
because when i speak at a regular volume ,
no one seems to believe me
that i &apos;ve put this amy nonsense behind me !
this documentary is gonna be awesome .
you gonna be okay down here ?
yeah . yeah ,
i feel like an archaeologist .
indiana jones and the single @-@ family dwelling .
hey . look !
found a seashell .
yeah , that &apos;s a rat skull .
relax .
there &apos;s enough droppings down here without you making more .
sorry . do you have a ... sense of where we are ?
yeah . i think that &apos;s the den .
okay , so we must be under the dining room .
yep .
you know , i know you don &apos;t want to hear this ,
but it wouldn &apos;t take that much work to turn that den
into a nursery .
why wouldn &apos;t i want to hear it ?
&apos;cause bernie said you didn &apos;t want kids .
that &apos;s not true at all .
i @-@ i wish she &apos;d get pregnant , believe me .
i &apos;m climbing on top of her every chance i get .
in a ... loving and respectful manner .
the point is ,
i really do want kids .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;s lying to you .
she &apos;s the one who doesn &apos;t want kids .
in fact , every time i bring up the subject ...
earthquake !
oh , my god , we &apos;re gonna die !
aftershock ... !
i can &apos;t believe sheldon was gonna ask amy to marry him .
i know .
i also can &apos;t believe he watched what we did on that couch
and still sits on it .
yeah .
hello .
hey , buddy . how you doing ?
better .
did wil and adam leave ?
yeah .
do you think they &apos;re going to put my outburst in the documentary ?
definitely .
oh , yeah .
well , there &apos;s no point in dwelling on it .
as the vulcans say ,
&quot; kup @-@ fun @-@ tor ha &apos;kiv na &apos;ish du stau . &quot;
do you know what that means ?
no .
are you telling the truth ?
nirsh .
well , this is ridiculous .
being upset about amy all the time isn &apos;t accomplishing anything .
if i want to resolve this situation ,
then i need to take action .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m going to find her and ask her to marry me .
and if she says yes , we can put this behind us
and resume our relationship .
and if she says no ...
well , then she can just ponfo miran .
he didn &apos;t meant that .
so i should probably explain why i kind of fibbed .
that would be nice .
i told my dad that you were the one who didn &apos;t want kids
because i didn &apos;t want to disappoint him .
but you were okay throwing me under the bus ?
turns out yeah , i didn &apos;t think twice about it .
bernie , you don &apos;t need to worry about me .
but i don &apos;t want to see you miss out .
raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life .
oh , please . mom did everything .
all you did was come home from work ,
sit on the couch and drink beer .
how is that raising kids ?
this is really a conversation for husband and wife .
i &apos;m gonna go clean up , hit the road .
if your mother asks , i was here till 10 : 00 .
it &apos;s interesting your father didn &apos;t help around the house
and howard doesn &apos;t help , either ,
so ... in a way ,
howard &apos;s not only like your father ,
but he &apos;s also like the child that you &apos;re afraid to have .
why are you still here ?
fine , i &apos;ll leave .
but it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper .
all right ...
i admit ...
that i don &apos;t help out a lot .
and i need to work on that .
but ...
if we had a kid ,
it would be different .
why ?
because ...
when my dad left ,
i promised myself that ...
if i ever had a chance to be a father ...
i &apos;d always be there .
okay , i &apos;ll think about it .
and this an actual &quot; i &apos;ll think about it , &quot;
not like the &quot; can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar
i &apos;ll think about it &quot; ?
it &apos;s an actual &quot; i &apos;ll think about it . &quot;
i really believe i &apos;d be a great dad .
i know you would .
speaking of ...
making babies , what do you say i wash up
and poke around your crawlspace ?
dr. dana feels he isn &apos;t that dangerous .
what makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong ?
because she feels . i don &apos;t .
all i know is logic .
yeah , right .
you can just shut your feelings off .
there goes television , lying to us again .
we let you raise our children ,
and this is the thanks we get .
leonard , how could i have been so foolish
to try and follow in the footsteps
of a made @-@ up alien race with no emotions ?
well ... now instead of idolizing fictional characters ,
you can focus on the real people who are already in your life .
those are very wise words .
thank you .
they &apos;d just be so much more comforting
if they came out of a television .
