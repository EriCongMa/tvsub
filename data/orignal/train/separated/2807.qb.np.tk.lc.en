i know , honey . i &apos;m sorry .

hey , guys .
hey , gunther .
hi .
you &apos;re going on a date with the noisy guy upstairs ?
well , he &apos;s very charming .
he &apos;s too charming !
but if you go out , it &apos;ll be harder for me to hate him .
you &apos;ll just have to try .
joey ? where are the jell @-@ o shots ?
i don &apos;t know . chandler &apos;s supposed to be passing them
chandler !
hello @-@ dee @-@ lo !
well , somebody &apos;s feeling better .
stick out your tongue !
take off your shirt !
oh , my !
oh , my god !
how many did you have ? they &apos;re pure vodka .
yeah , jell @-@ o. just like mom used to make .
the most unbelievable thing happened today .
i had lunch at monica &apos;s and met a guy ...
... who works for a buyer at bloomingdale &apos;s .
there &apos;s an opening there ! so i gave him my phone number ...
... and he &apos;ll call me this weekend to get me an interview !
so this guy &apos;s helping you for no apparent reason ?
and he &apos;s a total stranger ?
yeah . his name is &quot; mark &quot; something .
sounds like &quot; mark something &quot; wants to have some sex !
what ?
why else would he swoop in out of nowhere for no reason ?
to be nice ?
hey , joey , are men ever nice to strange women for no reason ?
no , only for sex .
thank you .
so did you tell &quot; mark something &quot; about me ?
i didn &apos;t have to . i was wearing ...
... my &quot; i heart ross &quot; sandwich board and ringing my bell .
joey ! happy birthday !
how many of that girl are you seeing ?
how hammered are you ? these are joey &apos;s sisters .
hi , joey &apos;s sisters !
what &apos;re we drinking over here ?
well , i have a vodka and cranberry juice .
no kidding ?
that &apos;s the same drink i made myself right after i shot my husband .
okay , i don &apos;t know how to talk to you .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m taking my ex @-@ girlfriend off my speed dialer .
no , it &apos;s a good thing .
why must we dial so speedily anyway ? why rush through life ?
why can &apos;t we savor the precious moments ?
you have some huge breasts !
hi .
hi .
so i heard about this mark guy that rachel met today .
isn &apos;t it great ?
yeah , pretty good . he sounds like a nice , good guy .
oh , he is . and he is so dreamy !
i mean , when he left , i actually used the phrase :
&quot; hummina , hummina , hummina . &quot;
that &apos;s excellent .
so he &apos;s &quot; just a nice guy . &quot;
do you really think this mark doesn &apos;t want anything for helping you ?
well , i assume i &apos;ll have to take showers with him .
but that &apos;s true of any job .
how you feeling ?
well , my apartment isn &apos;t there anymore ...
... because i drank it .
where &apos;d you go ? we lost you after you opened up all the presents .
i ended up in the storage room , and not alone .
no &quot; woo @-@ hooing . &quot; no &quot; woo @-@ hooing . &quot;
why , what happened ?
i fooled around with joey &apos;s sister .
that &apos;s not the worst part .
what is the worst part ?
i can &apos;t remember which sister .
you see what men do ? don &apos;t tell me men are nice .
this is men !
are you insane ?
joey will kill you . he &apos;ll actually kill you dead .
you don &apos;t think i thought of that ?
how can you not know which one ?
that &apos;s unbelievable .
was it gina ?
which one &apos;s gina ?
the dark , big hair , with airplane earrings .
that &apos;s dina , not gina .
see ? you can &apos;t tell which is which either !
we didn &apos;t fool around with any of them .
it &apos;s got to be veronica . the girl in the red skirt .
i definitely stuck my tongue down her throat !
that was me .
when i drink , sometimes i get overly friendly ...
... and i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s okay .
can i talk to you for a second ?
hey , joey !
come on .
why can &apos;t we talk in here ...
... with witnesses ?
i just got off the phone with my sister .
which one ?
mary angela .
mary angela .
now which one is she again ?
ask chandler . he fooled around with her .
she told me you said you could really fall for her .
is that true , or are you just getting over janice by groping my sister ?
it &apos;s gotta be the first one .
really ?
that &apos;s great !
you and my sister , sitting in a tree !
yep , i &apos;m in a tree .
did he call ? did mark call ?
i &apos;m sorry . but the weekend &apos;s not over yet .
oh , my god ! is that phoebe ?
guess they &apos;re back from their date .
music !
very nice !
oh , my god !
so how are you ?
i am good . i finished my book .
what &apos;s it about ?
i don &apos;t remember . do you want to take a walk ?
&quot; dear mary angela :
hi , how &apos;s it going ?
this is the hardest letter i &apos;ve ever had to write . &quot;
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you ?
how will joey react to you blowing off his sister with a letter ?
that &apos;s where you tell him that i moved to france ...
... when actually i &apos;ll be in cuba .
look , you &apos;ve got to do this yourself in person .
you know her name .
you just go to the house and ask for mary angela .
when whichever one she is comes to the door ...
... take her for a walk and let her down easy .
what if she comes to the door and i ask for her ?
where in cuba ?
what are you doing here ?
waiting for my grandma to do my laundry .
what about you ?
i &apos;m here to see mary angela .
you are so the man ! come on .
now look , listen . listen ....
be cool , because grandma doesn &apos;t know about you two .
you don &apos;t want to tick her off .
she was , like , the sixth person to spit on mussolini &apos;s hanging body .
where are your parents ? -they &apos;re in vermont , buying cigarettes .
where &apos;s mary angela ?
she &apos;s right in there .
hey , chandler !
hey , chandler !
i can &apos;t believe mark didn &apos;t call .
it &apos;s sunday night and he didn &apos;t call .
bummer .
yeah , right . look at you . you &apos;re practically giddy .
i &apos;m genuinely sorry the mark thing didn &apos;t work out .
look , rach , i want only good things for you .
wait a minute . why don &apos;t you just call mark ?
who says you have to sit and wait for him ?
you &apos;ve got to make stuff happen !
yeah , but you don &apos;t wanna seem too pushy .
it &apos;s not pushy . he gave her his home number .
he gave you his home number , as in , to his home ?
and you don &apos;t mind if i call , because you want good things for me .
that &apos;s right , good things . that is what i said .
mark ? hi , it &apos;s rachel greene .
oh , no . don &apos;t you apologize .
yeah , i &apos;ll hold .
he left my number at work .
then he had to help his niece with her report on the pioneers .
that is so made up !
oh , my god ! tomorrow ?
that &apos;s no , it &apos;s perfect .
oh , god ! thank you so much !
great .
i got the interview !
there you go !
he even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it .
that is amazing !
well , if i know mark , and i think i do ...

i gotta figure out what to wear .
high collar and baggy pants say , &quot; i &apos;m a pro ! &quot;
yeah , right .
okay , i &apos;ll see you guys later .

are you crazy ?
am l ? am i out of my mind ? am i losing my senses ?
this dreamy guy &apos;s taking my girlfriend out for a meal !
this isn &apos;t even about you !
it &apos;s about something wonderful happening for rachel .
even if you &apos;re right , and he wants to sleep with her ...
... does that mean he gets to ?
no , but
don &apos;t you trust her ?
then get over yourself ! grow up !

it &apos;s no big deal . chandler was just kissing me ...
... because he thought i was mary angela .
what ? how could you think she was mary angela ?
i wasn &apos;t sure which one mary angela was .

but i never thought you &apos;d be on the receiving end .
how could you do this ?
