第六季 第十六集
you &apos;ll never believe what happened to me at work today .
this old guy was choking on his food , and i saved his life .
you &apos;re kidding . did you heimlich him ?
no . i said , &quot; oh , my god , i think that old guy &apos;s choking , &quot;
and then one of the busboys heimlich &apos;ed him .
you &apos;re a hero .
yeah , that was the point of the story .
oh , yeah , speaking of work , do you know
if you have thursday night off ?
um , i think so . why ?
what do you mean , why ? it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
oh , right .
yeah , we can do something .
you could be a little more into it .
no , i &apos;m into it , i &apos;m into it .
just , there &apos;s so much pressure to make the night special ,
and it never works out .
okay , well , this time it &apos;s going to be different .
because i am like a romance ninja .
you don &apos;t see it coming , and then bam !
romance , watch out , hearts , kisses , love , ooh @-@ ya !
you know , sometimes i think i &apos;ve made you
so much cooler than you used to be ,
and then you go and do that .
so , in conclusion ,
i believe the painful sensation felt
after passing a meal of spicy chilies
is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste .
i concur , but you changed the subject .
what are we doing for valentine &apos;s day ?
oh , you caught that , did you ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay !
okay .
everything okay ?
bernie &apos;s a little cranky
since she &apos;s been working , like , 17 hours a day .
and i &apos;ve got a lot on my plate , too , because i &apos;ve been
busting my tail playing assassin &apos;s creed .
hey , stuart ,
you got anything going on for valentine &apos;s day ?
not really .
other than hiding all the sharp objects around here
and white @-@ knuckling it till morning .
what do you got going on ?
oh , well , i was going to spend the night
with my special little lady , but , uh ,
she got worms , and then i had to take her to the vet .
there must be something we can do .
well , uh , how about you keep the store open late ,
and we throw a party for all the people
who don &apos;t have dates ?
that actually sounds kind of nice .
yeah , the theme will be that the greatest love
a man can have is the love he has with himself .
that &apos;s good .
or maybe something a little less &quot; hand in the pants . &quot;
oh , alex , excellent .
i have a research problem
that i believe you can help with .
oh , dr. cooper , thank you .
i &apos;ve been waiting for an opportunity
to contribute to your scientific work .
oh , no , no . that &apos;s not going to happen , no .
what i need you to do is find a valentine &apos;s gift
for my girlfriend .
you realize i passed up an opportunity
to work at fermilab to take this job with you .
well , i guess those chaps will have to have
someone else buy their girlfriends presents .
now , here is ...
let &apos;s see .
this is ...
this is about $ 2,000 .
um , i think she likes monkeys and the color gray .
contribute to my work .
ah , kids say the darnedest things .
hey , you coming to lunch ?
yeah , one second .
come here . i want to show you something .
what you looking at ?
well , i was trying to come up with something
really romantic to give bernadette
for valentine &apos;s day since she &apos;s been
such a pain in the ass .
you can &apos;t find a card that says that ?
check it out .
i used the atomic force microscope
in the material science lab and wrote our initials
in a heart 1 / 1,000 the size of a grain of sand .
oh , that &apos;s cool .
a micro @-@ valentine for a microbiologist .
from her micro @-@ husband .
that is amazing .
how long did this take you ?
mmm , about 12 hours .
i pulled an all @-@ nighter .
yeah , i know , it really took a bite
out of my video game time .
what are you and penny doing ?
oh , i &apos;m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner .
oh , that &apos;s not bad , but as far as romance goes ,
i think my gift hits it right out of ...
want to come to dinner with us ?
yes , please .
okay .
amy will be here shortly ,
expecting the perfect valentine &apos;s gift , so ...
you &apos;re up kid .
dazzle me . go .
okay , i think i have some really great choices .
i went on amy &apos;s facebook page
and read up on her interests .
now , see , i never would have thought to do that .
clearly , i made a good choice
farming this out to you .
but i am telling you ,
amy hit the boyfriend jackpot .
anyway , my socks are on .
let &apos;s knock them off .
well , um , i know she loves playing the harp ,
so i found this beautiful music box
that plays one of her favorite songs .
now , amy already has a real harp .
and it can play any song .
what are you trying to pull here ?
no , i just thought it would be ...
next .
okay .
um , i know she &apos;s a fan of the canterbury tales ,
so i found ...
this cool map
that illustrates the characters &apos; journey through england .
i thought we could put it in a really nice frame .
but she &apos;s got google maps on her phone .
i don &apos;t know how to respond to that .
well , i hope it &apos;s with a third good option ,
because these first two ... blah .
okay .
well , uh , luckily , i saved the best for last .
since amy &apos;s a neuroscientist ,
i did some research and found out
that santiago ramony cajal ,
the father of modern neuroscience ,
did lots of hand drawings of brain cells .
and i managed to find
this signed print .
oh , this is truly remarkable .
thank you .
i think i &apos;ll keep it for myself .
what about your girlfriend ?
it &apos;s too late . i call dibs .
this place is really beautiful .
wah ... romance ninja .
sorry we &apos;re late .
no problem . we just sat down .
mmm , would you like some wine ?
yeah , fill her up .
i &apos;ll tell you when to stop .
is everything okay ?
terrific . couldn &apos;t be better .
oh , bite me .
look , we can still have a nice night .
just tell me where it is .
maybe if you did what you said you were going to do , i &apos;d tell you .
uh , where what is ?
she hid my xbox like i &apos;m a child .
yeah , and my mom got me that for my birthday ,
so if you don &apos;t give it back , i &apos;m telling .
i &apos;ve been working late every night .
all i asked was that he
clean the apartment and do one load of laundry .
but did he do it ? no .
he just kept on playing that stupid game .
you like pushing buttons so much ,
try pushing them on the washing machine .
i said i &apos;m sorry .
sorry doesn &apos;t clean my underpants , buddy .
i told you , turn them inside out .
and i told you to bite me .
trying to have a magical night here , guys .
oh , son of a bitch .
what ?
nothing . nothing .
no , tell me .
it &apos;s just this guy i used to date .
until he cheated on me with my friend gretchen ,
who &apos;s here with him now .
you &apos;re kidding .
and it looks like she lost a lot of weight , damn it .
i know it &apos;s not ideal ,
but don &apos;t let them ruin our night .
no , you &apos;re totally right .
she could be skinny &apos; cause she &apos;s dying .
that &apos;s the spirit .
you know what , screw them .
our night is going to be way more special than theirs .
yeah .
what ?
oh , you got to be kidding me .
oh , my god , yes .
of course i &apos;ll marry you .
two can play this game .
penny ...
get up .
all right .
it &apos;s nice that all the people who are lonely on valentine &apos;s day
can come here tonight and be together .
yeah , i &apos;m really looking forward to it .
in fact , there &apos;s no place i would rather be than here .
except on a date with anybody .
literally anybody .
you know , you and i have so much fun hanging out .
if you were a girl ,
all our problems would be solved .
what ?
oh , yeah , think about it .
we &apos;d hang out ,
we &apos;d read comic books , we &apos;d see movies .
it &apos;d be like the best relationship ever .
that does sound nice .
then i &apos;d take you home , slip off your little black dress
and just pile @-@ drive you into oblivion .
what ?
oh , i can &apos;t believe
he &apos;s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with .
isn &apos;t it kind of nice ?
i mean , he was with the wrong person ,
and now he found the right person .
what , so i &apos;m the wrong person ?
maybe you want to be with gretchen , too .
they do look happy .
yeah , maybe tonight .
but a year from now , he &apos;ll be
crawling under the sink looking for his xbox .
well , he will .
you know what ? why don &apos;t we just forget about them
and enjoy our valentine &apos;s day ?
yes , absolutely .
now they &apos;re doing that phony
link @-@ arm @-@ drink thingy .
i totally taught him that .
i thought we were letting it go .
we were ; it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s not fair , okay ?
they &apos;re bad people .
it &apos;s not supposed to end happy for them ;
it &apos;s supposed to end happy for me .
it did end happy for you .
you &apos;re here with me .
yeah , yeah , i know .
okay , this is getting a little hard to not take personally .
oh , come on , don &apos;t make this about you .
oh , i &apos;m not . it &apos;s about you .
yeah , well , whatever , okay ?
i told you , valentine &apos;s day sucks .
this one does , and you &apos;re the reason why .
what ?
you know , compared to them ,
i &apos;m feeling pretty good about us .
me , too .
how about we blow off dessert , go home early ...
i &apos;ll do that laundry .
thank you .
i love you .
love you , too .
so where &apos;d you hide it ?
where you &apos;d never look .
damn it , it &apos;s in the washing machine .
hello .
hello .
happy valentine &apos;s day .
okay .
shall we go to dinner ?
hang on .
as you know , i had planned a traditional evening
of romance and gifts .
yes ,
and as you know ,
i planned to pretend to enjoy it .
i &apos;ve been working on this facial expression all day .
and i appreciate your effort ,
but upon contemplation ,
i decided i was being selfish .
so , i canceled our dinner reservations
and came up with an even better way
to celebrate valentine &apos;s day .
what is that ?
by doing none of it--
no dinner ,
no romance , no gifts .
we stay here , order a pizza
and watch one of your beloved
star war trek things .
really ?
well , that &apos;s what you &apos;d love , isn &apos;t it ?
more than anything .
well , then ...
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
well ... i don &apos;t know what to say .
this is the most thoughtful gift
that anyone &apos;s ever given me .
and that &apos;s including an amazing gift
that i gave myself earlier today .
i &apos;m your girlfriend . that &apos;s my job .
and i know gift @-@ giving puts a lot of pressure on you ,
so whatever you got me , you can return .
no .
no , after everything you didn &apos;t do for me tonight ,
i want you to have it .
what &apos;s this ?
read it .
&quot; sheldon cooper ,
caltech university employee information &quot; ?
at the bottom .
&quot; in case of emergency , please contact ...
amy farrah fowler . &quot;
and there &apos;s my phone number .
this is the most beautiful gift you could &apos;ve ever given me .
well , i thought ,
if i have a stroke or a kidney stone ,
who would i want to share that with ?
and you picked me .
it &apos;s like you said--
you &apos;re my girlfriend .
oh , sheldon .
okay .
stop ruining valentine &apos;s day and order my pizza .
night .
yep .
you know what ?
that was pretty crappy of you .
i mean , all i wanted to do was give you a great night ,
and it &apos;s like you @-@ you went out of your way to destroy it .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m a total bitch .
i &apos;m not saying that .
well , i am .
fine , you win . you &apos;re a bitch .
why couldn &apos;t we just have a nice time ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe &apos; cause things are going so well between us lately
and i &apos;ve been really happy .
okay , you &apos;re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that .
obviously , i have some commitment issues .
glaringly obvious . go on .
as long as things keep going great between us ,
you &apos;ll keep asking me to marry you ,
and eventually i &apos;m gonna end up saying yes ,
and then we &apos;re gonna be married forever ,
and the whole thing just freaks me out .
okay .
i know i propose a lot .
so how about this ?
i promise i will never ask you to marry me again .
what ... what do you mean ?
are you breaking up with me ?
no .
no , no , no , no .
but if someday you decide you want to get married ,
you have to propose to me .
really ?
yes .
it &apos;s all on you .
but i got to tell you , when the time comes ,
i want the whole nine yards .
i want you down on one knee , flowers .
i want to be swept off my feet .
yeah , you got it .
and i &apos;m cool with surprises .
but nothing on a jumbotron .
i don &apos;t want to cry on a big screen like that .
okay .
you know what ?
this might be the wine talking ,
but i have a very important question to ask you .
you do ?
leonard hofstadter ...
yes ?
... will you be my valentine ?
sorry . maybe next year .
i &apos;m just kidding !
romance ninja . let &apos;s have sex !
thank you , guys , for doing this .
we &apos;re glad you could make it .
usually i spend valentine &apos;s day sad and alone .
this year , i &apos;m just sad .
what is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy ?
i know .
i hate myself most of the time ,
but tonight &apos;s the night i know everyone else does , too .
i think you &apos;re cool .
great .
i got to tell you ,
we &apos;ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this .
excuse me , everybody .
can i have your attention , please ?
we &apos;re all here tonight because ...
we have no one to be with .
but ... that doesn &apos;t make us mutants .
the only mutants here are in these comic books .
we &apos;ve got to stop defining our self @-@ worth
by whether or not we &apos;re in a relationship .
you know what i see when i look around ?
i see a room full of great people .
so let &apos;s give ourselves a break .
we are a community ,
and as long as we have each other ,
we &apos;re never truly alone .
that was cool .
what you said .
you really think so ?
yeah , i do .
thank you .
would you like to , uh ...
get a cup ... a cup of coffee or ... ?
okay .
later , losers !
hello ?
another medical emergency ?
what &apos;s wrong with him now ?
i seriously doubt he was bitten by a chinese bird spider .
how exactly does a bump feel asian ?
just put him on the phone .
sheldon , i am not driving over there again .
because i drove over there yesterday
for a brain tumor that turned out to be
an ice cream headache .
yes , i still want to be your emergency contact .
yes , you can eat your ice cream too fast
and also have a brain tumor .
i &apos;m on my way .
brain tumor would explain a lot .
