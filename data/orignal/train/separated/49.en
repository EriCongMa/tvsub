No.
Let me try that again.
No.
You're so cute when you're being emphatic.
Your brow gets all...
And the key word here is "Emphatic""
Mom said yes.
Because Mom likes to make me the mean divorced Dad.
I say no.
Why? Why do I say no?
Because I do not want some Palestinian version
of yourself blowing you up.
Dad, it's a kibbutz.
Unless one of the tractors blows up,
I'm going to be fine.
And do you know how hypocritical this is?
You're the one who always pushed me towards religion.
Of course I know how hypocritical this is.
I'm a parent.
It's my prerogative.
And now I have to go and save a campaign.
Are we having dinner on Thursday night?
Unless you back out.
You look happy.
Are you seeing someone?
Yes.
My pollster.
I'm the pollster.
I'm the daughter.
Good-bye.
Uh, she's 18.
No. I didn't say anything.
Is it good?
It's a silver bullet.
Wendy Scott-Carr, the untouchable candidate,
just became touchable.
What's her name?
Natalie Flores.
A student at DePaul, in Economics.
How long was she with Wendy?
Five years.
Judge Adler was doing her usual vetting
and Wendy Scott-Carr tried to hide everything about her.
Flores's address.
Well, I'll just go and complete the vetting.
You, uh, might get to the candidate's wife first.
This hits, the press will go right to her for comment.
Alicia won't help.
As long as she doesn't hurt.
No, I don't want a debate on it. Just fix it.
And don't look to Derrick.
BP is all our concern now.
Get me citings by 5:00.
Alicia, you sit with them.
You're doing a great job on Cowley.
Okay?
I just got off with her. You got any more...
We've got a problem.
She's on to us.
I'll call back.
She's on to us? Who's on to us?
The way she's dealing with the equity partners,
The way she's isolating my people.
She's gearing up for a fight.
Get the judge back on the phone.
You think I'm wrong?
I think I am surrounded by paranoid people.
I calmed the waters.
I stopped her defection.
Diane's behaving as any other name partner would,
as you should.
I think I made a mistake firing one of my people.
I lost one of my votes.
I'm going to hire him back.
You got to do what you got to do.
Look, I don't give a damn who's wrong.
Kalinda, you sit with them.
Where's Blake?
Uh, I heard he's out sick.
Okay. You sit with them.
Help them prepare questioning,
because honestly, what I give a damn about is...
Is...
What I give a damn about...
It's just...
It's not... It's not just, uh...
It's just...
One minute.
Hello.
Hi.
Been a while.
Yes. Quite a while.
Where have you been?
Here, there.
You?
Here.
I need your help.
Ms. Clinton seems to be doing quite well for herself.
Yes. So's your girl Palin.
2012, huh?
That's the hope.
Dear God.
Couldn't be worse than your man Barack.
Really?
I'm always astounded
when a man like you expresses such unadulterated drivel.
Funny. I'm never astounded when you do.
I'm being sued for $36 million.
See if Will will take my 11:00.
Thank you.
I'm just listening. That's all.
Who's suing you?
Jason Beltran.
You know who that is?
I do.
He just had his life sentence overturned.
He did.
A mistake was made at the Cook Country Crime Lab,
and that's why he was freed.
I think he was freed
because he was innocent, and the cops set him up.
He was freed because a crime lab tech made a mistake.
Manufactured evidence.
And misrepresented facts.
Who lied under oath.
Anyway, I didn't lie under oath,
and I didn't manufacture evidence.
But my trial testimony supported the lab tech's findings.
Now, Mr. Beltran shot and killed a police officer
during the commission of a bank robbery
and my ballistics testimony helped convict him.
That's why he's coming after me.
Beltran says he was an innocent bystander at the bank,
and the cops came after him because he was black.
He's lying.
I have to think about it.
No. Kurt...
Our firm benefited from this Cook County Crime Lab malfeasance.
We had two criminal cases overturned,
so I need to think about it.
It's not a brush-off.
You should have called me.
When you got back from your case in Florida.
You're right. I should have.
I'm sorry.
Bond thinks you're on to him,
so can you stop showing so much intensity
in the staff meetings, please?
Diane?
What?
You look happy.
I am happy. I've decided I'm good at my job.
You are good at your job.
I've always said it.
What is it?
We have a silver bullet.
Something that will destroy Wendy Scott-Carr,
but when we fire it, the press will come for you.
And I will send them to you.
No, it's not what you're thinking.
Later today, I'm meeting with a woman named Natalie Flores
who worked for five years as Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny.
That's your silver bullet?
Yes.
She had a nanny?
It's never the big things that bring politicians down.
She is an illegal alien.
Wendy wants to be state's attorney,
and for five years, she broke the law.
And not just any law.
People do not like illegal aliens.
And why would the press come to me?
You were a stay-at-home mom.
Isn't it great?
You were June Cleaver.
For 15 years, you raised the kids,
no nannies, no illegal aliens.
You're as American as apple pie.
I'm so glad those 15 years weren't wasted.
Yeah, don't say anything like that to the press, okay?
You're the good mom.
My staff will send over some brownie recipes.
Hey, Mom. Pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom. Pick up the phone.
Well, I have to go and do some good mothering now.
Grace.
You need a what?
A T-shirt.
It's not my fault, Mom. The school's fascist.
They won't let me go back to class unless I change my T-shirt.
Hello?
Tommy.
What a surprise.
Would you like to sit down?
No, no.
I'd like you to know that Kurt McVeigh is the enemy.
So imagine my surprise when I discovered
who's representing him.
Your information is premature.
I haven't decided yet.
Good, good. Then let me help you out.
The cops set up Jason Beltran.
They got the crime lab to fake the evidence,
and they got your ballistics expert to change his testimony.
Why are you suing, Tommy?
He's free.
Your client's free.
To teach the authorities a lesson.
I get a big award from McVeigh,
that will scare the state attorney into settling.
We've worked on a lot of cases together, Diane.
The grocer's union, the Houston squatters.
This goes against everything you stand for.
You don't know everything I stand for.
They want to use you, Diane,
a known and respected liberal.
They want to put a pretty face on a racist defense.
Don't you see that?
You know what?
Thanks for helping me decide.
I'll see you in court.
You're going to lose a lot of friends over this one.
Then they weren't friends to begin with.
I'll go after you hard.
Looking forward to it. Do your worst.
Good-bye.
馒头 Goldencui 小泡 petty
I'm sorry.
It's what?
The saying. It's not allowed.
It's a Christian saying, right?
It doesn't matter.
We've restricted all sayings on shirts.
Uh, and you don't think you'll have a problem
with the First Amendment?
A month ago, some kids wore
pro-gay T-shirts to school.
Then other kids wore anti-gay shirts.
This is not about the First Amendment.
I understand you have some issues here, ma'am.
But you don't circumvent those issues
by infringing on my daughter's rights.
You open yourself up to a lawsuit.
My firm is fighting a case like this, and...
I'm...
I'm sorry. I just can't.
I just...
You have no idea how hard it is.
Everyone's threatening me.
Everyone's threatening to sue.
You should sue.
It's the First Amendment.
So, are we Christians now?
No. They weren't letting Shannon wear it,
so I decided to wear it, too.
Can you just go to school and get an education, please?
Yes, I am on my way in. Everything all right?
But what if this were a different time
and they weren't letting kids wear Martin Luther King shirts?
I'll be right there.
What Martin Luther King shirts?
Grace, honey, I know you want a cause,
but this isn't your cause.
Why not?
Because Christians are in no danger
of becoming a minority class.
We'll talk. I got to go to work.
Go to school.
I need you to help Diane with this law suit.
He just got dropped by his insurance,
and he's pushing for a quick trial.
My only worry is that
Diane will lose her perspective on this one.
And you want me to...
Keep that perspective.
Okay.
How you doing?
I...
Never better.
Good.
Clearly, the most complicated crime scene of the year.
500 rounds fired.
Over 55 weapons. A shootout that lasted three minutes.
One police officer killed...
Four bank robbers.
Five.
Four bank robbers were killed at the crime scene,
and a suspected fifth, Jason Beltran, was arrested.
I feel like I'm being handled here.
We intend to pursue the same strategy
as your insurance company.
Which was?
You made a mistake.
What mistake?
Strategically,
the only way we win the suit
is to admit to an honest mistake.
They need to prove collusion
between you and the crime lab.
They need to prove that you wanted to get Beltran
and... they can't.
What they can do is play off your ego.
It's well known you only take cases you believe are...
true.
They'll try to show that you skewed the evidence
to make the case true.
Ms. Sharma, call for you.
Who is it?
He won't say.
He said you'd know what it's regarding.
Um, just take a number, and I'll call back.
I understand that you have to fight the best case,
not the truest case, but why...
isn't my strongest defense that there was no mistake?
Because the court
has determined that Beltran was wrongly convicted,
and we can't refight that.
That's why I need you to swallow your pride,
so we can win.
I determined
the direction and the caliber of the bullet
that killed Officer Walter, that's all.
I can't lie on the stand
about a mistake that doesn't exist.
It's just...
Thank you.
Find his mistake.
And if there isn't one?
He supported the lab tech...
there has to be one.
Will wants you on this?
Yeah.
Okay. Help Kalinda.
He didn't want to leave a message.
He said he'd try later.
Okay.
Anything you want to share?
No.
You're the mustard seed?
You have a problem with that?
Ms. Flores?
Is it time?
Is it...
Oh, no, uh, um, I- I'm Mr. Gold.
We talked on the phone.
Victoria Adler referred me.
Oh, yeah, uh, Vicki.
I just, I just have to get... to get this trade off.
The stock market?
Shenzhen Exchange.
It just opened.
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes.
My senior project.
I'm trying to prove
that the next great financial bubble is in pharmaceuticals.
Foreign money flooding into CDOs,
based on FDA clearances of drug studies.
Don't worry, I'm a nanny, too.
But if you want,
I can manage your money.
Oh, I...
I'm joking.
And...
I just shorted MRG.
Okay, uh, Mr. Gold, uh, what can I do for you?
Well, as I said on the phone, I have two children.
Ages...?
Six and eight.
Names?
Peter... and Alicia.
And you want tutoring, too?
I... No.
Yeah. I guess.
If-if that's possible.
It would have to work around my graduate degree.
Oh, I understand.
Can I ask you about your most recent employment?
You can.
I worked for the same family
for the last five years... two daughters.
Okay. And,
I hate to have to ask you this, but,
you know...
It's okay.
Vicki said that I could talk to you.
I was born in Nayarit, Mexico.
My parents came here when I was two.
But I am working with a lawyer on my citizenship.
All I've ever known is America.
Can I have the lawyer's name, just to check details?
Sure.
he says it could be a year before I get my citizenship,
but,
I will let him know that you're calling.
Give me a call, Mr. Gold.
I'm very good with kids.
I don't doubt that for a second, Ms. Flores.
And good luck with your thesis.
I did mine on the savings and loan meltdown,
a long time...
1986.
You were an economics major?
I was, many a moon ago.
Do you miss it?
Uh, economics, no, no.
It's too messy for me.
So, you went into...?
Party planning.
I would think that party planning
could get pretty darn messy.
Depends on the party.
A-anyway, I got to go.
The center camera?
Bank robber shot it out,
so I synched up the two outlying cameras.
So, the front of the bank is here?
Come on, will you two just bury the hatchet?
What hatchet?
I was considering Mrs. Florrick's fine question.
Look, Childs wants me to show you guys everything
because Beltran's lawyers are coming after us next.
So, yes.
Bank was here, Mrs. Florrick.
It was well organized.
They had assault weapons...
they tried to make off with $800,000.
Now, there's Beltran.
And there's Officer Walter.
12-year veteran, father of five.
Here it comes.
The bullet went through his body.
McVeigh discovered the nine-millimeter
bullet fragment there on the facing wall.
He determined from direction of fire
that only Beltran could have fired it.
So... either you're looking at an innocent man,
or someone who just got away with murder.
Think of ballistics as both a science and an art.
See, that's what I say to a jury first.
They love it when I compare it to something they know.
You see, an artist works with paints and brushes.
A ballistics expert works with direction and metal.
Bullets.
You see, it's not so simple.
Over 500 rounds.
Most crime scenes, they are two rounds, five rounds,
what have you.
Not so hard.
You disagree?
I just need to get some air.
No.
You think I am unworthy of you.
I think you have a gimmick.
I think you play up the whole...
ancient Chinese wisdom thing
to deflect from your lack of ability.
Okay, I don't think that...
My lack of ability is willing to help you.
Do you not want my help?
We want your help.
Hey, Jimmy Patrick back with you,
with my main man, J.T., behind the camera.
We are the mustard seeds.
Deal with it. Hey!
Time to get real here.
Because Jesus didn't come to bring peace,
he came to bring a sword.
Jesus says,
"For I came to set a man against his father,
and a daughter against her mother.
He who loves mother and father more than me
is not worthy.
Amen!
Last week I told you that Jesus is not
a Republican or a Democrat,
he hates global warming,
he hates polluters.
Jesus doesn't want you to stay off drugs
or get an "A."
He could give a crap.
He's the first rebel.
He wants you to question your parents.
He wants you to get in the face of authority.
He wants anarchy.
Okay, thank you. Bye.
Was that her lawyer?
Natalie's lawyer, yes.
And?
He's toying with her. It's a citizenship mill.
He's trying to make money out of her.
But that's good, right? I mean,
it's better for the story if she's not a citizen.
She'll be deported.
Right, back to Mexico. And?
You're right.
Do the polling; get it ready.
They'll put you on the stand first,
because they want to play on your ego.
They want you to defend your findings.
Just allow for doubt in your investigations, that's all.
You don't have to say you were wrong.
Just say there was
an 80% probability or something like that.
I know this is hard.
You want to fire it?
I was a pretty good shot.
Fire it.
No.
Why is there this attraction to guns?
I don't understand it.
This is an Austrian bullpup 5.56-millimeter assault rifle.
Here, try.
It's just so base.
Now, brace it against your shoulder.
It's a two-stage trigger, half for semi-automatic,
full for automatic.
I can't sleep with you.
Okay.
I'm your lawyer; it's unethical.
What's that piece of paper?
The retainer agreement.
I haven't signed it.
Not yet.
Ms. Lockhart?
The retainer?
Did you sign it?
Not yet.
Have you ever met my client, Mr. Jason Beltran?
No, I saw him in court, but that's about it.
At his criminal trial,
the trial that's since been overturned.
But to be accurate, I believe the verdict was vacated,
and the state's attorney declined to reprosecute.
Then you don't agree with the vacating of that sentence?
No, I think that the legal process
was... probably just.
Because of this one.
If that's Rosalie Torrance,
yes, I think you're right.
Then you've never met her,
The lab tech that falsified evidence against my client.
No, I talked to her on the phone.
But you know that she accidentally destroyed
forensic evidence collected at the crime scene
and then later falsified it to frame my client.
I do know that, and I do know that
she's being prosecuted for those falsifications.
And isn't it true that when she called you
to tell you about her findings, you changed your own findings?
No.
No? So why'd you change your findings?
Objection!
Huh? On what grounds?
Argumentative?
Because Mr. McVeigh was asked
whether he changed his findings,
but that has not yet been determined by the facts.
I see. Sustained.
But you originally concluded
that my client did not fire the gun.
Isn't that correct, Mr. McVeigh?
No.
I try to avoid early conclusions.
In all my investigations, there is an element of doubt.
I'm only 80%
sure of anything.
Mr. McVeigh,
are you a member of the Tea Party?
Objection, Your Honor.
Your Honor, it is our contention
that my client's prosecution was racist.
We believe
that Mr. McVeigh's membership in a racist organization...
Oh, come on. The Tea Party is racist?
Let Mrs. Lockhart argue the opposite.
Ms. Lockhart.
Yeah, what did I say?
Mrs.
My apologies. I was confused.
Your Honor?
I'm thinking!
Overruled. Proceed.
Is that a photo of you at a Tea Party rally
in Milwaukee last January?
Yes, it is.
Would you read to us the sign
that that man is holding next to you?
Your Honor, my client is not holding that sign,
and I would contest that he is next to him.
I think, uh, the jury can see that, Mrs. Lockhart.
That sign?
It appears to read, "Go back to the jungle."
And that refers to our current president?
I can't say that for certain.
I assume that's correct.
How many African-Americans
have you testified against, Mr. McVeigh?
How many accused?
Yeah.
I can't speak accurately to that.
Oh. Well, I can.
Eighty-nine.
Would you believe that?
I would believe that.
And how many white accused have you testified against?
My guess is that it would be less.
It is less. 22.
An even 22.
So, I would guess that my client never had a chance.
Objection, Your Honor!
Your Honor?
I heard you.
Sustained.
You need to talk to the nanny again.
Why?
There's sympathy for Wendy needing a nanny
among women 18 to 49.
Then we can't use it.
No, we can use it, but we need to find out
if Wendy fired the nanny because of the campaign.
Voters lose sympathy if she fired her for political reasons.
See?
That's the silver bullet. It's always the same.
It's not the act. It's the cover-up.
You need to go back to the nanny
and find out why she was let go.
I'll go ask.
Mr. McVeigh,
tell me about the Tea Party.
It's a political movement made up of
conservatives and libertarians intending to apply pressure
to the government to reduce spending.
Is it racist?
No.
Are there racists and extremists within it?
Yes.
Are there racists and extremists within the Democratic Party?
Objection. Relevance.
I'm sorry. What?
The question of whether there are racists
in the Democratic Party is not relevant, Your Honor.
Sustained.
But I, uh...
Yeah, okay, go ahead.
Why do you belong to the Tea Party?
I think the government
is encroaching too much into my life.
Isn't the Tea Party primarily anti-Obama?
No.
Then why wasn't it formed under George W. Bush?
There was hope that President Bush would cut spending.
Really?
I would acknowledge
that it was a slim hope and a thwarted hope,
but the Tea Party is not about Obama.
It's about putting pressure on both parties to reduce.
Because we're being bankrupted?
Yes.
That's all, Your Honor.
Well, I think that worked.
I mean, it was painful, but it worked.
What's wrong?
Go away!
But she hasn't lost perspective?
No. She's fighting harder.
Unfortunately, I need her to fight harder at work, too.
Why do you hate Jesus?
I don't hate Jesus.
I think Jesus is someone who lived 2,000 years ago
and has very little to do with me.
I think you either hate Jesus, or you love him.
I don't think there's an in between.
And why do you need wine to discuss this?
I don't need wine.
I like wine.
I like a glass of wine after work.
But you talk to me all the time about drugs.
Wine is a drug.
Very adult.
Yup.
Over 21, that's me.
You treat me like a kid.
You are a kid.
I'm not thinking like a kid.
So you're a mustard seed?
I think Jesus is someone I want to know more about.
I think science isn't taking prayer seriously enough.
I think global warming's real.
And I don't think believing in Jesus means
believing global warming doesn't exist.
Just taking another hit off the crack pipe.
I liked it more when you didn't work.
Okay, that's enough.
I'm not not going to work.
What is this about... Shannon?
Why does this have to be about Shannon?
I'm a thinking person.
I'm thinking about Jesus, okay?
So, you're becoming a Christian?
No.
I don't know.
I just don't like the way that you smirk at it.
I don't think I do smirk at it.
I just can't figure out
when one cause begins with you and another ends.
Jesus is not a cause.
He's the source of causes.
Okay.
You're rebelling.
That's what this is about.
So, when you can figure out
what it is you believe in,
let me know, and we'll talk, okay?
Well, Jesus was the first rebel.
Well, then, maybe Jesus can pay the rent every month.
Consider the lilies of the field.
They neither toil...
Yeah?
All right, so, you're not gonna like this.
A month before the bank robbery shootout,
there was this attempted suicide-by-cop.
A bank customer took a shot at a cop
to try and get the cop to kill him.
Uh, hang on, Cary.
That man... he's calling again.
Tell him this.
If he leaves me a number, I'll call him back.
And if he doesn't leave me a number,
then I won't call him back.
Yeah.
The cop didn't return fire. That's why he didn't report it.
I only found out about it when something seemed weird
about this nine millimeter shell fragment.
McVeigh included this nine millimeter
shell fragment in his analysis.
He thought it was part of the bullet to the officer.
So he screwed up?
Yeah.
Now, on the bright side, it wasn't his screwup.
He was never told of this attempted suicide-by-cop.
Thanks, but I don't think this is a guy
who can deal with a bright side.
See you.
His number.
Hey.
We found your mistake.
The nine millimeter fragment you found
was from an earlier crime.
So, what are we shorting today?
A new biomed IPO out of Boston.
I want to talk to you.
And I have a few questions for you, too.
Natalie!
Is everything okay?
What are you really after?
What am I...?
You don't want a nanny.
Why would you say that?
You called my lawyer, and you scared him.
He says now he's serious about working on my citizenship.
I thought he was serious before.
He says, now it's gonna take two months. Not a year.
I felt he was cheating you.
When I called him,
and I told him that he should not cheat you,
and I told him that he should not tell you I called.
Yes, well, he doesn't seem quite trustworthy.
So... what is it you want from me?
I don't know.
I have a boyfriend.
Or I had a boyfriend.
He joined a circus.
A Cirque du Soleil circus.
He's a contortionist.
He's a French-Canadian contortionist.
He gets very angry when I laugh at him.
But, um...
thank you for helping me,
but I...
you know, I'm in a very precarious position,
and I can't...
No, no, no. I-I don't...
Would you wait just one moment?
Hello?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Uh, no, no, don't worry.
Next time. Okay.
You have to go?
No, no. I-I...
Someone's canceling dinner plans.
Look, I get it.
Uh, you have a boyfriend, and I am much older than you.
And I have a dinner reservation
that I really should cancel.
And I know I can't...
I'm sorry.
That was me trying to do a contortionist thing.
Yup.
It's a downloaded file, right?
The DVD you made for the Beltran case?
The DVD the cops gave to McVeigh...
it's from a digital file.
Uh... yeah, I guess. Why?
Can you get me the original analogue surveillance footage?
It's late, Kalinda.
Why would I do that?
Because a compressed file drops frames,
and I need to see every frame.
Thank you for coming.
Why wouldn't I?
You're young.
Yep.
The future.
I want to understand the young.
You talk like a newspaper.
Oh, and that's the worst thing to be, right?
Someone who talks like a newspaper?
Well, it's not good.
Hello, there.
Well, hello, Marissa.
I thought you couldn't make it.
Change of plans, Dad.
How are you?
I'm Natalie.
Hi, Natalie.
Hi.
So, you're the reason my dad sounds so happy.
Marissa...
Yeah, I guess I am.
And how old are you?
I'm young.
I'm, oh, so young.
And how old are you?
I am so going to Israel.
Do you want to join us? We could get another chair.
Oh, no. I'll let you two eat in peace.
Love you, Dad.
Don't forget protection.
Well, wasn't that fun?
Yep.
So is-is that your six-year-old?
Sorry.
No. I Googled you
after you left.
You work for Peter Florrick.
And my old boss is Wendy Scott-Carr,
and your questions about me being a nanny,
those are for this campaign.
Not party planning.
Yes.
What I don't understand is,
why would you pressure my lawyer into helping me
if the whole point was to expose me?
Because I'm a hypocrite.
It would have been nice if you were a party planner.
I really liked the idea of that.
You don't have to go.
All right. So that's the original.
What are you looking for?
What?
There.
A ricochet.
How did I miss it?
The police gave you a copy of the surveillance tape
from a compressed file.
A truck was passing behind the police officer
and a ricochet is visible.
You had the right conclusion,
but the wrong bullet.
A ricochet to where?
I don't know.
I thought you could find out.
When this is over, let's go away.
Away? What? To where?
Costa Rica.
I like it.
No, I can't do that.
You can.
Well, no. I mean, not now.
I have a fight at work.
I can't give up on it.
If we don't do it now, we never will.
And...
what would we do?
Make a life.
Put our lives first.
Was that a proposal?
I would like to go away for a while with you.
If it sounds better as a proposal,
then it's a proposal.
That is a gunshot.
It distorts all sound around it.
Now imagine 500.
And then this is what is surprising.
Through all that...
Your Honor, may I see the new evidence?
Of course. Uh, Sheriff?
Through all that, Mr. McVeigh could determine
the entry wound was nine millimeters.
You're holding the bullet that was just discovered yesterday?
Yes.
Nine millimeters.
It ricocheted off passing truck.
And where was it discovered?
In drywall.
Covered in new plaster.
And this bullet was determined
to have been fired from Mr. Beltran's position?
Yes.
Only direction it could be fired from.
Excuse my accent.
When I get passionate, my accent comes out more.
No. You drop the case.
That won't happen.
It will happen.
Your client's lucky he's not back in prison.
It's not luck.
It's the Bill of Rights. Double jeopardy.
And so he should count himself lucky and go home and watch TV.
Because he pushes this trial, he's not only going to lose,
he's going to have the police making his life hell.
You want to say that again so I can get that on tape?
No, I want to say it again
so you can understand my words. You lost.
Huh. Beltran is guilty
and he's not going to make any money from this,
because I will make it my life's work
to keep him from making money from this.
Do you understand me?
This is not the Diane I know.
You're right about that.
Nice to meet you.
It's out.
I see that.
It's even better.
She took a friend's Social Security number to get into school.
Wendy might have helped her.
That is awesome.
It was the right thing to do, Eli.
I'll go crack open the champagne.
A hobbled Wendy Scott-Carr
can clearly revive the lagging campaign prospects
of ex-state's attorney Peter Florrick.
The once incorruptible image of the populist saint
hell-bent on cleaning has given way...
What do you want?
What do you mean?
Religion... what do you want from me?
Um, you and Dad don't go to church.
I don't go to church.
Dad has Pastor Isaiah.
Yeah, but I want to go to church.
Okay. Which one?
Um, I don't know.
I want to help you here, Grace,
but this is a new area for me.
And I don't know why it makes me uncomfortable,
but it makes me uncomfortable.
It's because of your generation.
Okay. Maybe.
Do you want me to drive you to church on Sunday?
Okay. Sure.
Okay. You pick a church, and I will take you.
And here.
I thought if you were going to be serious about it,
you should read up.
I'm going to bed.
After I score some crack.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I can't leave here now.
Then you'll never leave here.
Maybe.
But I made that decision a long time ago.
Come on.
Let's go.
Then I have to go.
Kurt.
Palin 2012.
You're my hero.
We need all the equity partners there.
Everybody on the same page.
Hello, Diane.
Derrick.
We were talking about the equity partners getting together.
Nothing important.
Just the usual house-cleaning.
Good. I think that's a good idea.
Then next week?
You all right with next week?
I am. I'm here.
Good.
Then I'll send out notices.
We'll go over the financials, new clients,
