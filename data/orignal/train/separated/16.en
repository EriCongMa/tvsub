第六季 第十集
No, no.
D-Don't put me on hold.
I need tickets for...
Oh, come on!
Gosh.
Hello, this is Ticket Hunt.
How may I help you?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Good, good, a live person.
Yes, I-I need two tickets
for the Neil Diamond concert tonight. I...
Okay, let me check availability.
No, no. D-Don't put me on hold.
It's for my wife and my anniversary tonight.
It's for t... t...
Oh, God.
What's this?
Where's carrot?
They didn't have carrot,
they just had banana walnut.
I don't like banana walnut.
You're needed in court, Your Honor.
All rise.
Okay, everybody sit.
Your Honor, I would like...
No. Ms. Pine-- what are you doing on your phone?
If I can't be on my phone, you can't be on your phone either.
This is... this is not carrot.
This... this is berry of some kind.
Oh, Mrs. Florrick, how are you this morning?
Showing your support?
Hello, Your Honor.
I'm surprised that you made time for us.
You know, running for State's Attorney and everything.
Anyway, everybody in my chambers for a 402.
You, you, you and you.
Let's go.
I don't think I'm much help here.
We'll call if we need you.
Cary.
It's odd to be on this side.
I know.
So, where are we at?
Because I really don't want to be
in that courtroom with you people.
If Mr. Agos pleads guilty we're offering ten years.
We're not taking ten years.
Well, you have a loser case, Diane.
If you think that, Your Honor, you should recuse yourself.
No, no. This is off the record, right, Judy?
Now, when Judy types, history takes notice.
Otherwise, I strong-arm both of you,
and we compromise somewhere in the middle.
That's a 402.
I did nothing wrong, Your Honor.
You're in my court, young man, that means you did something.
They're railroading me.
There is a wire that I will allow into evidence
that has you, Mr. Agos,
advising drug dealers how to avoid arrest.
Your Honor, that cannot be allowed into evidence.
It is hearsay.
Yeah, and she will argue "Forfeiture by wrongdoing."
And I will overrule your objection,
because she is right on the law.
And you know that and I know that.
So, take the plea.
No.
All right then, Ms. Pine.
Sweeten the deal.
Come on, I'm not your friend here.
Six years, that's the best...
There we go.
Diane, Mr. Agos,
this is called compromise.
Six years,
with day-to-day good time,
that means three years in prison.
What do you say?
I say no.
It's three years of your life, Cary.
You'll be a felon.
You won't be able to practice law.
Yes, but like Will said...
"Juries are a jump ball."
Judge could be in a bad mood,
a witness could fall apart, a juror change his mind.
I mean, they're unpredictable.
I can't go to jail again.
I was there a week, I can't even imagine...
Yes, but 15 years?
If you're convicted...
Ask Polmar.
Ask him what?
Ask him whether their bottom line is really three years.
So...
do you need a lawyer?
We're plea bargaining with Geneva Pine.
They offered Cary three years.
We're wondering what the SA's bottom line is.
Well, you know that it would be unethical for me to answer that.
Sorry, would you excuse me?
Hello.
Hello, Alicia, it's Jackie.
Uh, yes.
Jackie, I'm at work.
Can we talk later?
No, unfortunately, we can't.
I'm at Grace's school.
What's wrong? What happened?
Oh, nothing, um...
They couldn't get hold of you,
and my name is still on the contact list...
Is Grace all right?
Oh, yes, yes. No, everything's good.
But I think you'd better come down here.
Why?
Alicia, did you threaten to kill a teacher with a knife?
You're in luck, Mr. Kernal.
Cuesta.
I-I'm sorry, sir. I've located two tickets for
Neil Diamond at the Chicago State University location.
Oh, good, good. Can you reserve them for me?
Unfortunately, sir, those tickets will require
your physical presence at the university location.
And that office closes at 5:30.
You're needed in court, Your Honor.
Uh, hold onto them for me. I'll be there.
All rise. Court is in session.
Everybody sit.
Ms. Lockhart, where are we on the plea?
We reject the proposed plea offer, Your Honor.
You're not helping my day, Ms. Lockhart.
My apologies, Your Honor.
So...
we will continue with voir dire,
but I want you to know this jury will be seated today.
Let's go. Bring 'em in.
Mrs. Florrick, good. Maybe you can help us with this?
Hey, Mom.
Grace.
"Dear Coach Linklater,
"As I wrote yesterday, Grace needs to be excused from running
"in P.E. Because she's contracted a cold.
"If you make her run again,
"I will personally come down to your office
"and knife you in your lower intestine.
"I will then call Principal Englehardt to help you,
"But since he doesn't receive or accept
"parental calls of concern,
"You will most probably bleed out.
"Thank you for your concern,
Alicia Florrick."
Did you write this, Mrs. Florrick?
Okay.
Just to be clear-- it was a joke.
Have you ever seen Darkness at Noon?
No.
I was just quoting a threat the hero makes to someone.
I wrote it down to make Grace laugh.
It was just between us.
It was never meant to be delivered... to them.
Yes, and yet here it is on my desk.
Alicia is a good mother. She would never stab a teacher.
Thank you, Jackie. Uh, just to be clear--
it was a joke.
About killing a teacher?
It wasn't meant...
How did it get here anyway?
Grace is in my civics class,
and we were discussing free speech.
Was satire protected as free speech?
And afterwards I showed her the note.
To ask if this was protected.
And you laughed. You knew it was a joke.
I asked if I could keep it.
To show it to her husband. You said he'd get a laugh, too.
It's not Ms. Slavick's fault she brought it to me.
It's the responsibility of all teachers
to bring me threats without fail.
This is a threat.
It's a joke.
We don't like jokes like that here.
I understand. It won't happen again.
Guys, I think we should leave it there.
Good, then that's it. It was all just a misunderstanding.
And you think you can be impartial during this trial?
I think I can do my best.
Mm-hmm. This juror is acceptable to the defense, Your Honor.
We challenge this juror.
Oh, come on.
Your Honor, the prosecution has exhausted
its peremptory challenges.
We ask for sidebar conference.
All right, then get up here. Come on, fast.
We move to strike for cause, Your Honor.
This juror has a sister who's a defense attorney.
Your Honor, you have accepted another juror
with a policeman brother.
Look, you're wasting your time, ASA Pine.
I said we'd be done by 5:00.
Now, I find this juror acceptable. You are seated, sir.
So that completes voir dire.
And we will begin with opening arguments tomorrow.
Your Honor, I have a motion.
No, ASA Pine.
Tomorrow. That ends our time today.
And that means...
Oh, you're here. Welcome to your campaign headquarters.
They're arguing again.
About the interview?
I have no idea.
I think they just like it.
...Eli, not just on a guilty verdict,
but on a not guilty verdict.
If we make it an issue, it becomes a story.
So we have a problem?
Cary's trial.
I think if it's a guilty verdict, we don't say anything.
We can't comment while the verdict's under appeal.
They're not gonna let you get away with that.
Get away with what? We really shouldn't be commenting.
It'll look like she's betraying her partner.
Excuse me-- that's not yours to say.
I have an opinion.
Uh, no, you don't. Not when you're the body woman.
She's right, Eli. And you'd know that if you'd been with us more.
Oh, come on, don't pull that one.
Let's be honest-- your focus is split.
This story is only going to become a story...
Eli, Weekly Correspondent's on one.
Oh. Here we go.
They want to talk about Cary's trial.
Eli, you don't get to decide this.
We decide this.
Hey, Brian, it's Johnny.
How are you?
Good. I have a quote I need from you on a story I'm chasing.
Hi, Brian.
Eli's here, too.
Wow, I've got the two horsemen of the Apocalypse.
What do you need, Brian?
So tell me this isn't true.
Did Alicia Florrick threaten to murder a Chicago teacher
with a knife
and then let him bleed out like a pig?
Uh, what?
Did Alicia threaten to knife one of her daughter's teachers?
Brian, I...
What are you talking about?
So that's an unequivocal no?
Yes, it's a no. Are you insane?
Alicia. I think you'd better hear this.
Uh, good talking to you, Brian.
Anytime you want to know about flying saucers, call us, too.
What was that?
Nothing, he-he...
We're good.
He didn't even mention Cary's trial.
I think you'd better tell Alicia what he asked.
No, he was joking.
Did you threaten to murder one of your kid's teachers and
bleed him out like a pig?
Alicia.
Well, here's the thing.
We can't now. I have to head into court.
No, you can't call me. Not at home.
I can't leave him. I can't.
I'm going now.
I'm going.
And don't smile at me on the stand or I'll crack up.
Name and occupation, Detective?
Gary Prima.
I'm a detective with the narcotics section
of the Chicago Police Department.
Thank you, Detective.
And you had a confidential informant
record the defendant committing this crime?
Objection, your Honor. Argumentative.
That is correct. Sustained.
You had the defendant record the defendant?
The C.I. record the defendant?
Yes. Sorry, yes.
That's okay. Trey Wagner was a member of Lemond Bishop's crew,
and he agreed to record Mr. Bishop's attorney, Cary Agos.
And do you have that recording for this court?
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.
I think we've been over this, Your Honor.
Forfeiture by wrongdoing.
Yep, as I warned you,
Ms. Lockhart, this recording is subject
to a hearsay exception.
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I want you to know... Excuse me, gentlemen.
There is no cross talk in the jury box.
The only one in court who should be talking is me. Now,
I will allow this tape to be played,
but I want you to take into account that the defense
will not be able to cross-examine
the person who recorded the tape.
That person is dead.
So you may feel that this tape is not worthy
of your full consideration
because you're not hearing both sides of it.
But I leave that to you.
Now, Ms. Pine. Ms. Pine?
Yes.
Ms. Pine, you may continue.
Yes, Your Honor.
We ask leave to mark this tape as People's exhibit number one.
You're Bishop's lawyer, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm one of 'em.
So I have a question for you.
So you don't have to show them anything?
No, no, you just identify yourself.
If you're not driving a car,
you don't need all that.
They can't search you?
Well, how much are we talking about here?
Uh, 1 and a half kilos.
Someone's having a big party!
Damn, man! What do you got?
What did I say about jokes?
It was a joke from months ago.
You said you were gonna stab him.
It was from Darkness at Noon. I was quoting it.
Oh, really? Which episode?
Marissa.
Why write the note at all?
The P.E. teacher was shaming Grace into running laps
around the school when she was sick.
So you threatened to kill him.
Yes, Eli.
I threatened to kill him.
That was a joke. You can't joke.
What are we gonna say?
We got to get back to Brian at the Correspondent.
He's quoting us saying it's false.
The note. We have to get the note. Who has it?
The civics teacher.
Okay, you need to...
Wait, I thought you said it was the P.E. Teacher.
It was addressed to the P.E. Teacher.
Grace gave it to the civics teacher.
Oh, dear God, this is a nightmare.
The only bad people to have in your life are teachers.
I'd trust assassins over teachers.
This was my childhood.
People ask why I turned out the way I did.
So your daughter's got to get the note back.
You have to call Grace.
I got it.
We can't say it's a joke.
No, not without a long explanation.
It's like we're joking about school violence.
Wait. Okay.
She cares so much about her daughter...
She threatens to knife a teacher.
No, no.
Alicia didn't write the note-- her daughter did.
I'm not saying that.
She wrote it as an example of what not to... something.
No, it's a joke.
It's the truth. It's a joke.
What's the joke?
She's Alicia Florrick. Does she look like the type
who would knife a teacher? That's the joke.
Sometimes it's funny to say the thing that'll never happen.
We've all done it.
Okay, you need to get the note.
That's the bottom line. We can spin this,
but you need to get the note.
Grace. Uh, we need your help.
Do you have civics today?
Detective Prima,
was Trey Wagner your confidential informant?
Yes, he was.
And when was the last time you spoke with him?
The last time? Probably...
two months ago, just before he disappeared.
Didn't you speak with him on the phone a month ago?
I don't think ASA Pine has the answer to that, Detective.
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
Well, let's see where this goes.
Then we'll see how relevant it is.
Detective,
did you speak with Trey Wagner four weeks ago?
I spoke to someone who identified himself
as Trey Wagner,
but I wasn't... I couldn't be... sure.
But ASA Finn Polmar assured you
that it was Trey Wagner?
Yes, he did.
And did this person on the phone tell you
that he had set up Cary Agos?
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.
Your Honor, the ASA has opened
the door by presenting hearsay testimony
from this missing witness.
She should not be allowed
to now argue that these hearsay statements
are inadmissible because they hurt her case.
Well, she's got you there, ASA Pine.
Overruled. You may answer, Detective.
Yes. This person
said that he had set up Cary Agos.
And how did he do that?
By selectively turning the wire on and off
to make Mr. Agos' statements seem more damning.
And did he say
why he did that?
He said he was afraid of Mr. Bishop,
and he had to get us someone lower.
Meaning Cary. And how long after he said this
was Trey Wagner killed?
Objection.
Excuse me. How long after this
did Trey Wagner die in a car accident
that the police have called suspicious?
48 hours.
I see.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Okay, how exciting.
And we are adjourned for lunch.
Sweet Caroline. Ba-ba...
Found it.
Uh, hold on, Grace. Hold on.
"Grizzly Mom in Illinois Race Shows Claws."
Good headline.
Where is it?
BuzzFeed. Politics.
"Don't get Alicia Florrick angry.
It's reported that Alicia Florrick
Threatened a teacher at her daughter's
Tony high school with violence
for forcing her daughter to work out while sick."
It doesn't have the note?
No, it doesn't.
Hi. Sorry, Grace. What did she say?
She says she wants to give you back the note,
but first she wants to meet you in person.
What? Why?
I don't know. I think she wants to make sure
you don't threaten to kill someone again.
Dear Lord...
I thought she was nice.
Now I'm not so sure.
Okay. I'll call her.
Sorry to put you through this.
Mom, you didn't. I did.
No.
I need to stop joking.
They need to get a sense of humor.
Okay. Love you. Bye.
You're nice with your daughter.
Hi, Jon. What's wrong?
Yeah, BuzzFeed. The politics section.
Yeah, we're looking at it.
It's a good headline.
That points to a way out of this.
Yeah, hang on a second. I got Eli on speaker.
It points to a way out of this.
We need to push you as a grizzly mom.
Yeah, I agree.
It's all about how much you love your daughter.
I tried to stab a teacher because I love my daughter?
Alicia, are you joking?
Remember what I said about joking?
If we leave it vague, then, uh, we can argue grizzly mom.
But the minute the note is out there, then it becomes
about knives and bleeding out.
So you need to get that note.
Yeah, I'm working on it.
I'm really starting to hate those syllables.
Are you asking me how I would handle school violence?
Yes, but any school violence.
What are you watching?
Frank Prady. With the Correspondent board.
Well, let me say this,
if a teacher or a student threatened to knife
a teacher, yes, I would prosecute him.
Or her?
Yes.
To the fullest extent of the law.
And, yes, if there were even merely a written threat,
I would prosecute. School violence
is too serious to treat as a joke.
Alicia, he's coming after you.
We need to use our oppo on him.
Yeah, we're ready to go.
I've got two sources that'll say he's closeted.
Our fingerprints are never on it.
We point the reporter to the source.
They're starving for it at this point anyway.
If they don't go for a Prady story,
they'll go after you for the knifing.
Yeah, Alicia, we don't agree on much,
but we agree on this.
Okay, give me till tonight.
Alicia,
remember what I said about things moving fast.
Eli, please, we'll talk tonight.
You gave them reasonable doubt.
I know.
Do you know what to do?
I do.
Good.
Do it.
We cannot lose this.
So?
It's over between us?
I can't.
Right.
If it were another time.
Yeah. Now that you don't need me.
That's not fair.
Okay.
Now kick some ass.
Yes, Your Honor. We have another witness.
Goody for you.
Who is it?
Kalinda Sharma.
Let's go. Sidebar over.
I strongly object to this breach of protocol,
Your Honor.
Of course you object...
She was not on the final witness list, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the speedy trial provision
should follow the same freeway.
All right, enough. Enough.
The witness is in the woods
and ready to be questioned. So let's go.
You may proceed.
Name and occupation, please?
Kalinda Sharma.
I work as a freelance investigator.
And do you primarily work
for Mr. Agos' firm, Funnel, Ador & Lookout?
Yes. Primarily.
To your knowledge,
did Cary Agos work for Lumar Bishop
when he was emperor of the Lake District?
No.
He definitely was not.
Kalinda Sharma, are you
Cary Agos' hunter?
Objection, Your Honor.
This is an old lawyer trick.
I'm not trying to trick.
List Pine is lying under the question and possible movement...
I'll arm dresser, Your Honor, and cobbling the witness...
No, no, no.
This is not a time for a debit.
I-I didn't hear.
What did she say?
Who say?
The prosecutor, what did she ask?
She said, "Are you Cary Agos' lover?"
...old lumberjack. Asking leading questions and making
it appear like the wasted is nothing.
The objection is sustained.
Your Honor, we ask that you abstract nunneries.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I ask that you disregard the questions
and answers that you just heard.
They have been deemed inadmissible.
Have we been avoiding each other?
I... don't think that we have,
but... we should probably talk anyway.
I don't want to avoid you.
I know.
I-I hate awkwardness at work...
I do, too. It's idiotic.
Exactly. Like high school.
Okay, so let's not.
So here's the thing,
I like you as a friend.
And I like you.
It's stupid to drop a friendship just because...
Exactly.
So here's what we do. We-we have rules.
Good. Love it.
We meet in brightly lit diners, not bars.
Pancakes, not drinks.
Yes. And we...
talk about... the law.
Great. With accordion music.
Well, unfortunately, accordion music kind of turns me on.
Okay. No music.
I'll see you.
So what the hell?
Excuse me?
You leaked to the press
these two guys who said they had an affair with me?
I thought we agreed...
Wait, wait, what?
You leaked to the press...
I did not.
O-or your people. Your handlers did it.
Excuse me, we did not.
Do we have an agreement or don't we?
We said we wouldn't smear each other.
Wait a minute. Who's the one who went to the correspondent
and told them that I should be prosecuted?
Are you serious?
You wanted to roll a one-day story into a fight.
I didn't know you threatened to stab a teacher.
The story was already out.
Well, so? They didn't offer me any context.
They just asked me if I would prosecute a woman
for threatening to stab a teacher, and, yes, oddly enough,
I said yes. I-I didn't know it was about you.
Then correct it.
Correct what?
Tell the correspondent that
you know what I wrote was a joke,
and that they were wrong to take it out of context.
Ah, are we not friends anymore, Frank?
Wait a minute. Our agreement wasn't to help each other win.
It was just that we not fight dirty.
And you did.
I didn't.
I didn't know what they were saying.
Okay.
Then let's just leave it there.
So, you're gonna let your handlers leak dirt on me,
dirt you know isn't true?
I have no knowledge that my handlers did any such thing.
So we're right back where we started.
No.
We're even in the polls now.
Well, then, we will return to chambers.
Oh, Your Honor, I object.
And you're overruled.
Sheriff, please excuse the jurors.
Uh, all except juror number 11.
Please escort him to chambers.
Why?
What happened?
I don't know.
They took our only slam-dunk juror into chambers.
You think Geneva's trying to bounce her?
Him, and it looks like it.
Well, how's the alternate?
Bad.
Both are bad.
Keep me in touch?
Thank you for coming, Alicia.
I know you must be busy.
Oh, never too busy for Grace's teachers.
So, I-I know you want this note back.
I'm so sorry how this got blown out of proportion.
I knew you were joking, but the liability issues...
I understand.
So, Grace said you wanted to talk to me?
My husband works with the teacher's union,
and over the last five years, there has been a decrease
in school crime oversight in the S.A.'s office.
Really?
Yes.
It's terrible.
There used to be a task force made up of eight teachers
who would advise the state's attorney on school crime.
And you would like to have that back?
Yes, we would love to have that back.
With eight positions set aside for teacher union members.
That would be really great for us.
Just give it to her.
No. It's patronage.
Well, of course, it's patronage, Alicia.
How do you think this thing works?
Eli, I said "No" to patronage.
And I congratulate you on that stance, Alicia,
but you need this note not to circulate.
Alicia, it's important to show that you stand up to patronage,
but the key word here is "Show."
There is some patronage that everybody accepts.
Your husband accepted...
Exactly. I'm not going to be like Peter.
You know. Ethics.
Mr. Fratti, is it?
It is. What's wrong?
Have a seat.
I have a note here from an anonymous juror reading,
"I think juror number 11 might be partially deaf.
"He is having trouble understanding the proceedings,
and he continually asks those around him what's going on."
Now, are you partially deaf, Mr. Fratti?
No.
Your Honor, I...
Excuse me. You told us not to talk.
Stop it. I-I understand what's going on here.
Ms. Lockhart, you think he's pro-defense,
and you want him to stay, and, Ms. Pine, you want him to go.
Well, shush, both of you.
Now, Mr. Fratti,
is there anything that would prevent you
from understanding this trial?
I didn't hide anything.
I know that, sir.
Is there anything
that would prevent your understanding?
During certain moments of stress,
I can suffer from APD--
Auditory Processing Disorder.
And why didn't you mention this during voir dire?
Because it only rarely affects me,
which was the question put to me.
On occasion, I can have difficulty
with the sequencing of words, or confuse similar sounds.
But did this affect you during trial?
No, Your Honor. I completely followed the trial,
and I have certain coping mechanisms...
Your Honor, this is...
He says he has followed the trial.
Wait, wait, wait.
Mr. Fratti, I have a question for you.
What waxing the number of the last wideness?
Your Honor, it is not a common name.
How is that relevant?
Ms. Lockhart, please!
We're not in a schoolyard.
Now, what did I ask you, Mr. Fratti?
You asked me the name of the last witness,
and I think it was Kalinda something?
Your Honor, may I ask a question?
No, but I will.
The question, Mr. Fratti,
is whether Cary Agos hurt lemons
bussing the important tree-mills of honeycuts.
Um, I'm sorry.
I thought you were innocent.
I need your help, Kalinda.
We don't have a strong enough case.
Um, I'm sorry.
I thought you were innocent.
I need your help, Kalinda.
We don't have a strong enough case.
Let me see what I can do, okay?
How's it going?
Not good. Cary lost his juror.
Damn it. How can I help?
We need to get a lead on Dante.
Bishop's man?
Yeah. He's the only one still alive
who heard what was edited out of the wire.
I can't get anything from Finn.
Alicia, he knows that Cary is innocent,
he knows this is a wrongful prosecution,
and he will hear it if you say it.
Just ask him for any lead that could get us to Dante, anything.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
You're kidding me.
"I will personally come down to your office, and knife you
in your lower intestines..."
"You will most probably bleed out."
You know, for some reason, I thought this was gonna be funnier.
Where is it, on a blog?
Yeah. The Correspondent blog.
Give her the patronage, Alicia.
What's it matter now?
You need the union.
I have to go.
Order up.
Cleanup. Can I get cleanup over here?
Well, you succeeded in finding the ugliest diner in Chicago.
Well, it helps that we both smell like wet dogs.
And pancakes. Perfect.
So, fellow lawyer...
I have a request that's gonna make us both uncomfortable.
Great. That's why I'm here.
You heard about Cary's trial?
He lost a juror.
Yes.
We need to find Dante.
He's the only one still alive
who can testify that Cary's innocent,
that the wire was edited.
You know I can't say anything.
I do.
It's just, I thought...
Well, that's not good.
It's the storm. Hold on.
You were saying?
I was saying? No, I think you-you were...
Oh, yeah. Um...
Yeah.
I can't say anything.
You're kidding.
Of course.
So, you can't say anything?
I can't.
What's that?
I can't say anything.
Surveillance photos from Bishop's house.
Anybody entering or exiting.
Of course, I don't know how you got 'em, because, uh,
well... I can't say anything.
I wasn't even there!
Yes, you were! Why are you lying to me?
I'm not lying. You won't listen.
My dad's fighting.
He'll be right here. It's just his girlfriend.
Sure.
It's not... it's not your business!
Do you work with my dad?
Uh, sometimes.
Do you come here after school?
Yeah. Why?
No reason. Is that at 3:00?
Okay? This is not gonna work
if you don't trust me. You need to trust me.
Very adult.
Dylan, it's time to go to bed.
I know.
I love you.
You, too.
What do you need, Kalinda?
Dante.
Yeah. A lot of people need Dante.
Why are you coming to me?
Because I think you know where he is.
And if you wanted him to testify, he would.
All right, then maybe I don't want him to testify.
It's-it's a little late.
Can-can we do this another time?
I have some photos I need you to see.
These are State's Attorney
surveillance photos of your house.
Kalinda... I know you like Cary,
but you shouldn't be here saying that to me.
And you shouldn't be here with such a weak weapon.
These are four known drug dealers entering your front door.
Yeah, well, too bad.
I'm not there. Do you see me in that picture?
Oh, you don't need to be there, sir.
For them to arrest me, I sure do.
This is not about you.
This is about Dylan.
There's enough here for Child Services to take your son away.
These are copies.
They are not originals.
Anyone know you're here?
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Who do you think I am?
I'm not...
No. You come here to threaten me?
You come here to threaten my son?
I'm not threatening you.
Look, we want to help you...
but... we need your help.
Get out of here, Kalinda...
before I think about this too much.
How did you find Dante?
Don't tell me.
You're a lifesaver.
Looking forward to this being over.
Uh, Your Honor, we have a new name
to add to the witness list-- Dante Wallach.
Dante Wallach.
And you know the defendant?
That guy? Yeah.
And you were in Mr. Bishop's kitchen with him
on May 25 of this year?
Yeah.
And did you ask him questions about your business?
Yeah.
And you have heard the prosecutor's tape
of this conversation?
The wire? Yeah.
And does this tape...
reflect your conversation?
Yeah. I-I mean...
what do you mean?
Did Cary tell you
how to break the law?
Yeah.
Uh, Mr. Wallach,
let me ask you again...
I think he already answered.
I am asking whether Cary told you that he couldn't help you
break the law.
No, he told us how to break the law.
How to be smart about it.
Uh, Mr. Wallach, excuse me,
but you told us outside of this court the exact opposite
of what you're saying here.
Nah. Maybe you misheard it.
Is someone threatening you, Mr. Wallach?
Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.
Uh, then I need a sidebar, Your Honor.
Sure, come on up. Let's do this.
Don't you ever threaten me again, do you understand?
Get him to tell the truth.
I need to know that you understand, Kalinda.
I understand, sir.
Now, get him to tell the truth.
That's your problem.
All right, enough, enough. The witness...
Cary.
Look.
I will talk to him again.
No.
You can't.
You can't take the plea.
Four months ago...
my life was... it was just that, it was my life,
and now I don't know what it is.
I go from one nightmare to another,
and I just want it to be over.
They're gonna convict me.
We don't have a case.
I look at the jury...
and they want to put me away.
Cary, do you have a minute?
Oh, yeah.
Geneva has a new offer.
Mr. Agos.
Hello.
The State's Attorney is prepared to offer time served,
with six months' probation.
Really?
If you testify against Bishop.
I can't do that.
I understand.
Then we're prepared to offer
a lighter sentence on the conspiracy charge.
Four years.
With time served?
No.
With day-for-day good time, that's two years in prison.
That's the best you'll ever get.
What do you think?
Uh, I think I'm angry.
She's not wrong, Cary.
We go to jury, you might get 15 years.
That's seven and a half in real time.
Or you get out when you're 37.
It all comes crashing down.
Cary, where are you going?
I need some air.
How's he doing?
I don't know. It's so hard.
I can't imagine being in his position.
Where is he?
Um, downstairs walking.
I'm coming over.
Yep. I think that would be good.
What do you think he should do?
Take the four years or fight?
Yes.
I have no idea.
Oh, did you really threaten to knife
your daughter's P.E. teacher?
Not one of my better moments.
I'll see you.
...claiming that the note Alicia Florrick wrote
in which she threatened to stab a teacher
What? What happened?
...was intended as a joke.
Mrs. Florrick is
a perfect parent.
She was joking with her daughter, that's all.
I want to be clear.
We take school violence seriously.
But this was purely a misunderstanding.
Mrs. Florrick
has been a real friend of our school and...
You guys didn't...
Didn't what?
Offer patronage.
I said I wouldn't do that.
And you didn't.
You're saying that these teachers just changed their mind?
Yeah. After getting seats on the Illinois Safety Commission.
Peter.
Yep. He had some empty seats
on a new commission he formed.
So that's good--
you didn't offer patronage.
Yep.
Cary.
How are you?
Hunky-dory.
Would you like to talk?
Sure. Why not?
You've been good, Cary.
Thank you.
I know what you're up against.
Four years.
That's a hard one.
Trial's not over yet.
Yeah.
It is.
They want you.
They'll get you.
I have a way to move you out of the country.
You won't be able to return, but I'll get you an apartment.
I need a legal consultant in Europe.
It'll be good pay.
I'm not being purely selfless.
I need someone loyal that can help me.
Where would it be?
Barcelona.
What do you think?
Uh, I think that I can't do that.
Why?
The firm put up $1.3 million.
I jump bail, they don't get that back.
So send them the money from overseas.
Don't go to jail for four years because of a law firm.
So...
how's it going?
Not good, from the sound of things.
Momentary setback.
You got to fight it, Cary.
No.
No, I don't.
Four years.
Two years for good behavior. And you didn't do it.
I know.
I'll be 37. I can do that.
I can't do 15 years.
Dear Lord, Cary.
What are you gonna do?
The choices have been reduced.
We can appeal. I mean, you take the plea,
you can't appeal.
Alicia...
I have watched you long enough with clients to know
when you have a case or when you don't.
The smart deal here is to take the plea.
You'll come and see me?
I will.
Good, good.
I don't want to be lonely.
Would you like to revise your plea, Mr. Agos?
Yes, Your Honor. I would like to plead guilty.
