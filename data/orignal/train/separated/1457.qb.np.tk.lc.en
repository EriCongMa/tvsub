what the heck is that ?
what ? !
we &apos;re back .
we got alex the cutest prom dress .
show your dad .
well , i don &apos;t like how far down that zipper goes ,
but on the plus side , it looks water @-@ resistant .
i can &apos;t believe haley &apos;s not going
to the prom and alex is .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i know i keep saying it , haley , but you should be going .
it &apos;s a major moment in a teenager &apos;s life ,
and you &apos;re missing it .
proms are lame .
it &apos;s just an excuse for dressed up dorks
to ride in limos and hump each other .
okay . now i don &apos;t like the idea of alex going .
sweetie , i think we &apos;re fine . it &apos;s--it &apos;s alex .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means you &apos;re a geek .
you know what ? you know what ?
i might just go crazy tonight
and--and--and hook up all over him .
okay .
why are you laughing ? that &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m not even gonna wear my glasses !
i feel better now .
all right , i &apos;m going to the mall .
um , we need to talk , honey .
we &apos;re worried about you .
you haven &apos;t heard back from the college that wait @-@ listed you ,
and all the rest of your friends have .
and now you &apos;re just wasting time at the mall .
for your information ,
i &apos;ve already filled out and dropped off
my community college application .
and plus also
i &apos;m going to the mall because i have a job interview .
what ?
really ?
my guidance counselor suggested i take a gap year .
you know , a year between high school and college
where you take some courses , have some life experiences ,
and get inspired .
and obviously , work at the gap .
the first step in plane building--
organize the parts .
you got your power plant . you got your fuselage .
you got your control surfaces .
what &apos;s that ?
a charcuterie .
you got your prosciutto , your pancetta ,
your salami .
that &apos;s charcuterie ?
i &apos;ve been avoiding that on menus for years .
they &apos;re killing themselves with that name .
they &apos;re here ! they &apos;re here !
thank you so much for doing this . thank you . thank you .
of course .
okay , so her recital &apos;s at 6 : 00 .

guys , you wanna take our charcuterie for the road ?
bup , bup , bup , bup . they &apos;re good . we may need that .
hello ?

h @-@ hold on one second .
i think it &apos;s the baby &apos;s family . they &apos;re speaking spanish . i--
hola , soy cameron . omo esta ?
uh , b--excuse me . could you s--
could you slow down just a little bit ?
what does frenetico mean ?
it &apos;s when ...
or just let her do it .
yeah . there you go . okay .
hello ?
si , si .
i was doing fine .
he thinks he &apos;s some sort of an expert
because for the past two weeks , he &apos;s been watching
this ridiculous spanish soap opera .
&quot; fire and ice &quot; ?
don &apos;t say a word about the ending of last night &apos;s episode .
g @-@ gloria watches that . you &apos;ll ruin it .
si . muchisimas gracias .
it was the mother &apos;s sister juanita .
she said that she doesn &apos;t know the exact hospital yet ,
but that she will call you , like , in the next hour .
oh , thank you , gloria . i @-@ i hate to ask this of you ,
but would you mind coming with us ?
we need someone who actually knows how to speak spanish .
frio . muy frio .
ay , yes , of course ! i would love to ! thank you ! thank you !
i &apos;m gonna grab my stuff , and we go , okay ?
all right , sweetheart . all right , come here .
daddies gotta go , okay ?

cam , come on . come on .

ciao , jay ! ciao , manny ! i see you later , okay ?
what just happened here ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
she &apos;s talking to you .
you wanna take that ?
always keep the rhythm in your feet .
then we &apos;re gonna add just a little party in the shoulders . all right ?
now let &apos;s get those arms going .
no , no , no . arms down here says ,
&quot; i &apos;m white and i &apos;m sorry , &quot;
but arms up here says ,
&quot; you don &apos;t know what i am . &quot;
i @-@ i don &apos;t .
you &apos;re never gonna believe it !
you &apos;re never gonna believe it !
you &apos;re never gonna believe it !
guess who got a job ! i did !
oh , shoot . i just told you .
oh ! honey , congratulations !
that &apos;s amazing !
you got a job !
and what is all this ?
i stopped by the grocery store to get some stuff for dinner .
you know where the grocery store is ?
yes , mother .
i &apos;m celebrating by making dinner for me and dylan tonight .
would you and dad like to join us ?
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
tonight at dinner ,
i &apos;m telling my parents the biggest news of all .
after graduation , i &apos;m moving in with someone .
and his name is me .
watch me dance .
honey , you don &apos;t need to practice anymore .
the turning , the jumping , the little bird thing--
you &apos;ve got it .
what &apos;s this ?
sweetie , please don &apos;t play with the pieces .
i &apos;ve told you , they &apos;re very delicate .
what are you building ?
it &apos;s a model of a plane that was built for amelia earhart .
why ?
because she wanted to fly around the world .
why ?
because she probably needed to get away from her kids .
why ?
you know how to stop this ?
i &apos;m on it .
lily , we really need you to let us concentrate
for a few minutes , okay ?
your hair is weird .
um , now i &apos;m flustered .
oh , you look adorable !
&quot; adorable &quot; ? i &apos;m not a puppy .
oh , honey , it was meant as a compliment .
claire , i got this . honey , you look super sexy .
ew .
well , we tried everything .
oh , good @-@ bye !
wait ! wait , wait !
we wanna meet this casanova .
oh , no , parents aren &apos;t really his scene .
alex , open the door . we are going to get a picture .
fine .
you ... look ... flawless .
thanks .
did i not say coral was the color for you ?
look what it does for your skin .
hi !
hi , buddy .
hi .
yes , my bad boy prom date is gay .
he just doesn &apos;t know it yet ,
so i &apos;m basically his beard .
pre @-@ beard .
his stubble .
okay , say &quot; cheese &quot; !
cheese .
okay , now one with flash .
cheese .
cheese !
okay , i think you got the picture .
well , you guys have fun .
do you want me to touch up your hair , honey ?
oh , no , i &apos;m good .
ay , please stop driving the car like a snake .
it &apos;s making me nauseating .
well , uh , if you want to switch places ,
there &apos;s plenty of room to stretch out back here .
yeah , that &apos;s why we traded
our old prius in for the new one .
you know , bigger family , bigger backseat .
you can fit two car seats
and a prize @-@ winning pig back there .
please don &apos;t put a pig in the backseat with our children .
i &apos;m not being literal .
it &apos;s a unit of measurement we used on the farm .
you know , like , &quot; that bed &apos;s a double @-@ pigger . &quot;
oh , uh , sorry . maybe think about something else .
you know , i missed &quot; fire and ice &quot; on monday .
what happened ?
my guess is a bunch of ridiculous plot turns
done by overwrought actors who are impossibly good @-@ looking .
don &apos;t listen to him .
nothing , really .
antonio hired a hooker to marry his father
so that he can get back the money ,
but the hooker ended up being his long lost sister ,
the former beauty queen .
oh . well , i stand uncorrected .
ay , please just drive straighter .
oh , sorry . are my pinkies up again ?
i--they do that when i get excited .
down , girls !
well , alex should be hitting the dance floor right about now .
must be fun .
really , dad , let it go .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
i &apos;m just sad you &apos;re missing it .
i can still totally picture my prom night .
my date was angela wilkins .
my dad dressed as a limo driver and spoke with a british accent .
he even announced our arrival .
&quot; sir philliam dunphy and the lady wilkins ! &quot;
all the cool kids were totally laughing with us .
oh , i &apos;m just so glad we met after that .
me , too .
yeah .
wonder what ever happened to angela ?
you don &apos;t know ?
i haven &apos;t seen her in over 20 years ,
but that &apos;s what &apos;s special about prom .
no matter what ...
the lady wilkins and i will always have that night .
oh , no , no , no ! we got this .
we &apos;ll clean .
you &apos;re cleaning up ?
what kind of day is this ?
cam and mitch get a new son ,
we get a new daughter .
that was really fun , you guys .
yeah , and next time , we &apos;ll just do it at our place .
i &apos;m in . just give me a heads @-@ up .
&quot; our place &quot; ? what ? what ?
um , well ,
since i have a job now
and i &apos;m going to community college ,
uh , dylan and i were thinking that , you know ,
we would get an apartment together .
what ?
are you doing sex ?
okay .
luke , can we have a minute , please ?
listen ...
i know that you &apos;re concerned ,
but i &apos;m designing t @-@ shirts now , and they &apos;re gonna be huge .
also medium and small .
dylan , would you excuse us for a moment so we can talk to haley ?
sure , but you stay . i &apos;ll go .
hi . uh , uh , buenos noches .
uh , uh , we &apos;re looking for ... uh , english ?
uh , well , juanita . we &apos;re looking for juanita .
hola !
hi .
mitchell y cameron ?
ah , she says , &quot; hello , mitch and cameron . &quot;
i think we got that .
ay , you brought me here .
thank you ...
did you get that , too ?
yeah , a lot of it . mm @-@ hmm .
just ... just tell us .
the baby was born half @-@ hour ago , that he &apos;s in perfect health .
he was 7 pounds , 4 ounces , with thick hair and brown eyes .
that &apos;s so good !
juanita !
gloria , what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know . the priest comes with great warning .
that can &apos;t be good .
shh ! something about the grandmother . she &apos;s sick .
but now she &apos;s better .
and now she knows !
knows what ?
what was that for ? !
the nurse stole her grandmother &apos;s almonds .
no , the nurse is mad at juanita
because juanita stole her lover ,
and juanita is mad at the nurse
because the nurse told the grandmother about the baby !
our baby ?
our baby ?
we &apos;re both thinking it . i &apos;m just gonna say it .
lily &apos;s dance is not up to the standard of what we just saw .
in my head , i &apos;m golfing right now .
hi , mr. pritchett ? i &apos;m lily &apos;s dance teacher lucy .
we have a little bit of an issue .
lily doesn &apos;t want to perform .
oh , the poor thing .
you get the kid , i &apos;ll get the car .
oh , no .
it &apos;s really important for lily &apos;s self @-@ esteem that she go on .
i think one of you should talk to her .
you know she stinks , right ?
and i think it should be you .
lily .
your teacher tells me you don &apos;t want to dance . is that true ?
but you were so good back at the house
when you were practicing .
i wanna go home , to my house .
ah , to your house , huh ?
are you sad your dads aren &apos;t here ?
yeah . well , i know they &apos;re sad to miss this ,
but they &apos;re getting you that baby brother .
that &apos;s good , right ?
you know , honey ,
your dads are gonna love you just as much
when you get this brother . trust me .
i first had your aunt claire , and then your dad came along ,
and i loved them just the same ,
no matter what he tells you .
you believe me ?
close enough .
so what do you say ?
you gonna go out there and dance for everybody ?
no .
honey , there must be something i can do to get you out there .
come dance with me , grandpa .
no , honey , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
how about i give you 50 bucks ?
i don &apos;t see why i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m totally getting my life together .
uh , allow me , if you will ,
to paint an accurate picture of this life
yeah . you think you want , okay ?
um , at first , it &apos;s a blast--
buying a dish rack ,
hanging a sheet up to turn one room into two .
allen @-@ wrenching a bookcase called a nurnk ...
because you couldn &apos;t afford the sklurg .
but then ...
then those bills start rolling in ...
oh . so you gotta pick up some extra shifts .
yeah . and suddenly ...
uh @-@ oh , what &apos;s that ? you &apos;re pregnant .
should &apos;ve been safe .
ooh , and you &apos;re stressed and exhausted .
you &apos;ve got a garage filled with unsold huge t @-@ shirts .
and , honey , if you think this kind of stress
is not gonna take its toll on that body and that face ,
think again .
good @-@ bye , beautiful skin .
farewell , silky hair .
and hello , alex &apos;s hand @-@ me @-@ downs ,
&apos;cause you can &apos;t afford to shop .
good one .
do you think that this is gonna work out ?
yes .
well , for my parents , i mean .
for you ?
no .
god .
i just wanna live with haley so bad .
it &apos;s like , i missed all this time with her in wyoming .
then i thought i was gonna lose her again to college .
don &apos;t worry . i got your back , buddy . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
what does that mean ?
dylan , shut the door .
the bedroom door .
excuse me . excuse me .
okay .
we &apos;re very confused .
can somebody please just tell us what &apos;s happening ?
somebody told the grandmother about the baby ,
and she wasn &apos;t supposed to know .
if you ask me , it was the sexy priest .
enough !
it wasn &apos;t the priest .
it was me .
eduardo !
what &apos;s happening ?
yes , i am alive .
and i may be just a ranch hand ,
but i &apos;m the one that told your abuela about the baby .
i told her because i swore to your mother
to look after your family .
your mother ...
was my lover .
ay , wait a minute . now i go from english to spanish .
c @-@ can we please just see our baby ?
no !
abuela ?
abuela ?
she &apos;s saying that she &apos;s going to raise the baby .
no .
cam .
come here . come on .
guess what ? suddenly , you &apos;re 60 years old ,
wandering toothless and alone in a postapocalyptic wasteland .
wait a second . how did dylan get the nuclear codes again ?
during the robot wars .
okay , i think your father might have gotten
a little bit off @-@ track here . honey , listen , the point is ,
the choices you make today--
no , no , the point is ,
is that it doesn &apos;t have to turn out so bad .
she &apos;s right .
it doesn &apos;t . luke ?
this came yesterday .
what is it ?
it &apos;s from that college .
you got in , haley .
oh , d--

i don &apos;t know .
do you not want her to go to college ?
i don &apos;t care .
aw ! you &apos;re gonna miss me !
shut up ! i am not ! i &apos;m never telling you anything again .
sorry , little dude , but she &apos;s gotta go to college ,
even if that means that she can &apos;t live with me .
oh , dylan .
could you do one thing for me , though ?
could you take me to your prom ?
really ?
yeah .
i mean , if you go off to college and you don &apos;t come back here ,
i want you to remember me .
i wanna be your angela wilkins .
mom ?
yes .

too old for ?
mm , in spite of that , yeah . yeah .

i &apos;m just sick of it , cam .
mitchell , come back here and talk to me .
there are coyotes out here and--and meth addicts !
every time , cam .
every time someone says that we &apos;re getting a @-@ a baby ,
i get my hopes up and then ...
and then when it all falls apart , i ...
we just have to go through the whole thing again .
and then meanwhile , the child that we do have
is--is at a recital , and--and we &apos;re missing it .
i know .
i &apos;m as frustrated as you are .
are you ? because i @-@ i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t know how much more of this i can take .
i am--i am so tired
and--and just disappointed .
and ... i &apos;m just tired .
then let &apos;s take a break .
really ?
it must be exhausting ,
always keeping it together for the both of us .
and i &apos;m tired , too .
i think i &apos;m lying on a rock .
i &apos;m lying next to my rock .
there &apos;s certain moments in life that you never forget ,
like when i held manny in my arms for the very first time .
i was nervous . i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .
what do you think ?
you guys look amazing .
oh , our little girl !
and i was excited to see him grow up .
bye , sweetie .
have fun , man .
she &apos;s asleep .
i tell you , kid , i &apos;m too old for this .
you and me both .
and the more he becomes the little man i know today ,

which is good , because i &apos;m going to do it all over again .
turns out that i wasn &apos;t carsick .
i &apos;m pregnant .
