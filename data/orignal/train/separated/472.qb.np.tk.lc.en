how &apos;s this ?
mmm ... yeah .
isn &apos;t that good ?
yeah . that &apos;s it .
i swear to god , i &apos;m never running another marathon again .
you know , if a mugger was after me ,
i wouldn &apos;t be able to run away .
what was that ?
stay here .
mike ?
mike .
hello ?
cheryl !
call 911 !
my husband and i thought it was a bomb or something .
just a busted water main .
we &apos;re gonna have to get into their yard , too .
are your neighbors home ?
their cars aren &apos;t here ,
but i &apos;m sure the johnsons would be fine with you going back there .
i &apos;ll try their cells .
are you sure you shouldn &apos;t say anything ?
positive .
people think we &apos;re having an affair .
can &apos;t we just say we &apos;re on assignment ?
no one can know . what are you afraid of ?
the stares , the whispers .
spence has been asking me questions .
rossi &apos;s been onto us from day one .
good luck out there .
thank you .
where are you going ?
i got your text .
i love you very much ,
but you need to read more than just the first sentence .
the case is like 5 miles away .
what the hell happened ?
jj will fill you in .
it &apos;s--
it &apos;s a crazy town .
water and power company was digging in the backyard ,
found the remains of two bodies .
how long have the johnsons lived here ?
35 years and they &apos;re upstanding citizens .
husband &apos;s the block captain ,
the wife &apos;s on neighborhood watch .
there &apos;s no indication of how long the bodies have been here .
we &apos;re waiting for the m.e. to arrive .
forensics will tell us how long they &apos;ve been down there .
where &apos;s the family now ?
the husband and son work at the father &apos;s construction company .
they &apos;re on their way back home right now ,
and mrs. johnson &apos;s inside the house .
i &apos;m going to go talk to her .
how is she ?
wishing we were publishers clearing house .
there he is .
charles !
mrs. johnson .
charles , tell these officers
that we don &apos;t know anything about dead bodies in our yard .
what are you talking about ?
they think we &apos;re killers .
can i help you gentlemen ?
thank you , officer .
yes , sir , i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbi .
i need to talk to you .
about what ?
lyle ? !
lyle ?
lyle !
lyle !
down off the wall !
turn around slowly and let me see your hands .
please , don &apos;t shoot .
we just want to talk to you , lyle .
i didn &apos;t do nothing .
i understand .
i just want to talk to you .
strange fruit
&quot; the universe doesn &apos;t like secrets .
it conspires to reveal the truth to lead you to it . &quot;
lisa unger .
what &apos;s going on ? whose bodies are those ?
ma &apos;am , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
and you think i have anything to do with it ?
i have to read to the seniors at the convalescent home in an hour .
you &apos;re not gonna make it today .
why &apos;d you have to separate us ?
we didn &apos;t kill those people .
lyle only ran because he was scared .
scared of what ?
you !
the government &apos;s gone mad .
first they got wiretapping , then they got stand your ground .
now they got the feds showing up
at normal folks &apos; home for no damn reason .
lyle , i told you , this is standard procedure .
the remains of two bodies were found in your yard .
that has nothing to do with us ,
and as soon as you figure that out ,
i &apos;m gonna sue you guys for emotional distress .
i can tell from the pelvic and hip measurements
that both victims were female .
what about their ages ?
the hardening of the sternum puts them both
in their early 30s when they were killed .
what &apos;s your interrogation strategy ?
well , we &apos;ll start with distinguishing
between the distress of having the bodies
found in their backyard and the stress of being brought here .
ok , that &apos;s smart , but how are you gonna test that ?
put them under additional stress and then give them good news .
the innocent ones will show some release in their demeanor
and the guilty ones won &apos;t .
they &apos;ll still be holding on to some terrible secret .
thank you .
ok , mrs. johnson ,
why don &apos;t we just start at the beginning .
how long have you guys lived in that house ?
uh ... 35 years .
it &apos;s a big home for such a small family .
have you ever had any tenants ?
no .
just me and lyle and charles .
it was a fixer @-@ upper for my husband .
he &apos;s a contractor .
he loves working on the house .
so do i. i do the same thing .
how many times have you redone the kitchen ?
at least 3 times .
did the , uh , upstairs bathrooms twice .
did your family ever help with the renovations ?
my wife &apos;s a real martha stewart .
she changed the curtains in the bedroom 4 times ,
repaired her sewing room at least , what , 8 ?
and how about the yard ?
uh , tina wanted to put a pool back there ,
but we , you know , we wouldn &apos;t have the time to use it .
you always lived at home , lyle ?
i tried living on my own for a little bit ,
but it didn &apos;t work out .
and when was that ?
7 years ago .
it was an sro .
full of rejects and roaches .
and that &apos;s why you moved back home ?
i like living in a house better . is that a crime ?
you like having a backyard ?
who wouldn &apos;t ?
what do you do back there ?
smoke weed .
hang out with my gang , you know ?
do you take care of the yard ?
oh , yes , sir . i mow the lawn , sir .
now , you want me to mow your lawn , sir ?
have you been able to determine approximate time of death yet ?
well , the degree of decomposition and bone pitting
suggests these women were killed about 10 years ago .
do you know what killed them ?
like i thought , they were beaten to death ,
but there is one other thing .
that was blake .
they &apos;ve established that the bodies
were two approximately 30 @-@ year @-@ old women
who were buried 10 years ago .
that makes them lyle &apos;s age .
do we have i.d.s ?
they &apos;re working on dna .
garcia , start working on a list of missing persons
and people who moved out of the area at the time .
already typing .
was there any signature ?
the condition of the pelvic bone suggests mutilated genitalia .
if we can get the names of the women
and establish lyle knew them ,
then it &apos;s game on .
or game over .
did you ever have any parties at the house , lyle ?
no , sir . i sure don &apos;t , sir .
really ?
a man your age who &apos;s lived in the same house
his whole life has never had a get @-@ together or a party ?
that &apos;s what i said , sir .
what about dates ?
oh , a little , sir .
is that ok , sir ?
i need all the names of the women that you dated
who may have come back to the house .
what if i don &apos;t want to give them to you ?
what are you gonna do ? you gonna make me ...
sir ?
why do you feel so powerless , lyle ?
powerless , sir ?
it would explain why you took your power back
by mutilating your victims &apos; genitalia .
mutilation ? what are you talking about ?
you think i killed those people ?
i think you tortured them and you buried them in your backyard .
you &apos;re tripping .
did you become enraged
because they wouldn &apos;t have sex with you ?
or did you kill them because you couldn &apos;t get it up ?
you son of a bitch .
you son of a bitch !
that &apos;s enough .
leave him .
we &apos;re getting started , lyle .
lyle seemed pretty happy .
in the eighties he did , but to be honest ,
from 2000 on , he &apos;s barely in here .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s practically invisible .
maybe his parents suspected he was a killer
and subconsciously started distancing themselves from lyle .
isolation coupled with homicidal ideation
would have made him even more reclusive .
well , lyle looks good for it .
he ran , got physical ,
he &apos;s the same age as his victims .
he has the strength to carry out the crime .
and has access to the yard .
you going to jump back in there ?
no , i think we should let him sit .
jj , let &apos;s pull his school records ,
talk to neighbors , teachers , anybody we can find .
i &apos;m on it .
ah , come on , there &apos;s gotta be something .
a guy capable of this kind of brutality
has got to have a pretty sketchy record .
creepy bingo .
before lyle worked for his dad ,
he worked at a variety of fast food establishments ,
and he was either warned or written up every month .
ok , so he has an inability to deal with authority .
raising a kid like that would have been hard .
i remember when i gave birth to lyle .
my heart sank whey they told me i &apos;d had a boy .
you wanted a girl .
this country is not too kind to black boys .
emmett till ,
oscar grant ,
开枪警员辞职避过内部调查导致群众游行抗议 &#93;
trayvon martin .
so you were concerned about lyle &apos;s safety .
virginia &apos;s still the south , agent rossi .
i &apos;m concerned about a lot of things .
has lyle ever given you reason to fear him ?
are you suggesting he &apos;s a monster ?
a stereotype ?
well , from his work record and our interview with your son ,
it appears he has a bad temper .
he could be hardheaded ,
get angry over the smallest thing .
can you give me an example ?
he &apos;d snap for no reason at all .
would he get physical ?
did he ever hit you or threaten you ?
one time , he--
he threw a tv at my head .
it wasn &apos;t at her head ,
it was near her head .
well , how did your son &apos;s anger get out of control ?
it was one incident . it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
well , did this happen during his adolescence ?
how was he in school ?
well , he &apos;d raise his hand
and the teacher wouldn &apos;t call on him , you know ?
he &apos;d ask a girl out , she &apos;d laugh .
and what would he do when things got like that ?
well , he &apos;d sit in his room alone and sulk .
well , maybe he was depressed .
black people don &apos;t have time to be depressed .
did he ever try therapy ?
or medication ?
charles is against it .
why ?
you think slaves had prozac ?
no . they got out there , they worked .
so if your son has mental issues ,
you think he should just push through them .
you &apos;re damn right .
if lyle isn &apos;t hanging sheetrock ,
he &apos;s laying hardwood floors .
i have that boy out there from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day .
he hasn &apos;t had the time or the energy to kill anybody .
i made sure of that .
he &apos;s picking his cuticles and rubbing his hands incessantly ,
which means he &apos;s holding something back .
so garcia found out lyle had a sealed juvie record .
turns out he kicked his neighbor &apos;s dog to death .
what have you got ?
we just got the dna results back from one of the female victims .
her name is mary ann beck . she went missing 10 years ago .
she &apos;s also a high school classmate of lyle &apos;s .
did they know each other ?
can &apos;t tell .
we haven &apos;t found a direct connection to the house yet .
all right , tear his room apart .
if lyle &apos;s got secrets , we need to know what they are .
what are you thinking ?
well , his initial reaction , he looked guilty .
but he &apos;s so antagonistic and he &apos;s not even trying to cover .
he &apos;s intentionally trying to push your buttons .
all right . let &apos;s go get a couple of earwigs
and send you two back in there .
we need to determine whether he knows mary ann beck .
if you &apos;re gonna put me in jail , just put me in jail .
i wasn &apos;t gonna put you in jail .
you gonna put him in jail ?
we just needed to ask you a few more questions .
so ...
do you like blondes or brunettes , lyle ?
i don &apos;t know .
why ?
you know , people think blondes have more fun .
but sometimes , not so much .
you know her , lyle ?
never seen the girl .
she was in your senior class .
that was a long time ago .
yeah , and she also lived a couple blocks
from the burger place you worked .
a lot of people live near there .
yeah , but not people who look like her .
that long blond hair ,
pretty smile ,
sparkling eyes .
she &apos;s not my type .
i think you dated her ,
and her dad got mad .
what are you talking about ?
we dug her up from your yard .
you &apos;re lying !
she &apos;s not dead !
no , lyle , you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m gonna ask you again .
did you know mary ann beck ?
no .
lyle would have kept his secrets close to him ,
easy for him to have access to .
probably while he was in bed .
this ...
we should get this to forensics .
look at this . mary ann beck .
he lied .
it was filled in 1991 .
let me see .
it &apos;s testosterone . my uncle used to take this .
lyle could have been using it to bulk up .
if he was still taking it 10 years ago ,
it could have pushed him over the edge .
and caused him to beat mary ann to death .
you &apos;re full of crap , lyle .
we found testosterone in your bedroom .
and pictures of you and mary ann .
we know what you did . you dated her .
and when she wanted to break up with you , you couldn &apos;t take it .
oh , please , that &apos;s--that &apos;s not what happened .
and you took the pills why ? &apos; cause you couldn &apos;t get it up ,
is that what happened ?
no , you don &apos;t understand--
you hit her and then the rage took over .
no .
and you beat her !
no ! i didn &apos;t .
you beat her till she stopped moving .
you were so angry that you mutilated her .
and then you buried her .
and every day you look out that window ,
you know what you did .
stop saying that !
just admit it , lyle !
you beat this girl and you killed her .
you did .
fine ! i did it !
dr. reid .
what &apos;s up ?
we got another one .
this one looks like a male .
so let &apos;s get this straight .
the first person you killed was mary ann beck .
that was 10 years ago .
that &apos;s right .
and you killed the second woman 10 years ago as well ,
but you don &apos;t remember her name .
that &apos;s what i said .
we just found another body , lyle .
i did that , too .
ask him if the third victim was male or female ?
and at that time , did you kill a man or a woman ?
a guy .
so you beat him
and mutilated his genitals ?
do you want me to draw you a picture ?
you don &apos;t have to .
because we don &apos;t believe you , lyle .
i did it . i told you .
the females were killed 10 years ago ,
but the man we dug up out of your backyard
was killed 35 years ago .
you would have been 5 .
so what ?
you may have seen the kill , lyle ,
or even heard it ,
but you didn &apos;t do it .
you didn &apos;t do any of this .
where &apos;s my son ?
he &apos;s not coming .
he couldn &apos;t have confessed to any damn murder .
i want to see him .
do you remember the central park jogger case ?
yeah . the whole country remembers that .
you remember how law enforcement got those kids
to confess to something they didn &apos;t do ?
what about it ?
well , we train law enforcement now
to identify and prevent false confessions .
we found a body near your shed ,
belonging to a man who was killed 35 years ago .
now , your son lyle was just a toddler then ,
and your wife doesn &apos;t pick up anything heavier than a gardening hoe ,
and the personal nature of these crimes tells us
there was just one offender .
you .
and only you .
so , how do you want to play this , charles ?
you want to tell me what happened ?
nothing happened .
unless you figure out something happened .
charles doesn &apos;t sleep here .
i know , because he sleeps back here .
the guy &apos;s nostalgic .
clearly high school was important to him .
what &apos;s odd is that he has trophies
all the way up to 11th grade ,
and then nothing in his senior year .
look at this .
he &apos;s taking testosterone , just like his son .
it could be for age related loss of vitality ,
wanting a boost in his libido .
he and tina aren &apos;t sleeping together , though .
you know . lyle &apos;s bottle was from 1991
and there are only a few pills taken .
lyle could have been taking them from his father .
mr. johnson &apos;s more likely the one with the chronic issue .
why was your husband taking testosterone , mrs. johnson ?
was it for sexual reasons ?
you and charles sleep in separate rooms .
you don &apos;t know what we do .
he snores . and why are you asking me ?
so you are sexually active ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
do you know if he was seeing someone else ?
you ought to be ashamed .
ma &apos;am , women were murdered
and sexually mutilated , and then buried in your backyard .
we didn &apos;t do nothin &apos; .
we didn &apos;t do nothing .
we didn &apos;t do nothin &apos; .
you notice the phrasing ?
well , they &apos;re from the south .
no , it sounds like she reacting
to something that someone else did .
this could be about retaliation .
that would explain charles &apos; obsession with the past .
did you like growing up in virginia ?
i didn &apos;t know any different .
what did your parents do ?
my mother was the help
and my father was the butler .
but there were good times , right ?
you liked baseball .
we found negro league memorabilia in your house .
you &apos;re a josh gibson fan .
yeah . &quot; a home run a day ,
boost in my pay . &quot;
yeah , i like satchel paige myself .
um , &quot; don &apos;t look back . something might be gaining on you . &quot;
he also said ,
&quot; the only change is that baseball
&quot; has turned paige from a second @-@ class citizen
to a second @-@ class immortal . &quot;
what did you think when the leagues finally integrated ?
i was happy , of course .
well , then , how did you feel
when you found out that your son was dating a white girl ?
i told lyle to get rid of these .
so you did know about them .
is that why you killed her ?
you didn &apos;t want to see your son dating a white girl ?
you don &apos;t know me .
you killed lyle &apos;s girlfriend
and buried her in your backyard .
i did not .
i think we &apos;re gonna be here a while , charles .
i &apos;m getting hungry .
you ?
how are those missing persons reports going ?
any i.d. on the other woman ?
no , nothing yet .
all right , find out everything you can about mary ann beck .
we need to see if we can connect her to those two victims .
yes , sir .
so ...
why did you mutilate mary ann &apos;s genitalia ?
i didn &apos;t mutilate anything .
and you cut the other girl , too .
and the guy .
sexual punishment across gender lines
is pretty different .
i think that somewhere down the line ,
a man and a woman each made you question your sexuality .
you despise both sexes .
if that were the case ,
i wouldn &apos;t be living with my son and my wife .
well , that &apos;s just part of your facade .
those people in your backyard
are victims of your rage .
rage ? what do you know about a black man &apos;s rage ?
you know nothing .
come on , lyle .
you gotta help me out here .
please , just leave my dad out of this , ok ?
nothing can justify what he did to those women ,
those people .
why are you covering for him , lyle ?
he killed and mutilated your girlfriend .
no . i did that .
you said she wasn &apos;t your girlfriend .
she was .
she was , you know .
what have you got ?
m.e. &apos; s office rushed the dna test
and got an i.d. on the man found near the shed .
good . i &apos;ll have garcia find out who he is .
we identified the guy in your yard .
james moses .
you know a james moses , charles ?
only moses i know parted the red sea .
well , james moses
was friends with mary ann beck &apos;s father karl beck .
do you know karl beck ?
i told you i don &apos;t know any becks .
well , these two guys belonged to a little group
called the cleanse .
you ever hear of the cleanse , charles ?
sounds like one of those new age diets .
no , they were a klan chapter in your town
back in the sixties .
when did you graduate high school ?
&apos;63 , &apos; 64 , something like that ?
maybe . what about it ?
well , they were pretty active back then .
you see the picture i &apos;m painting ?
it &apos;s a little abstract .
i think you killed james moses 35 years ago .
and you wanted to kill karl beck as well ,
but he was already dead .
so when your son started dating his daughter years later ,
you killed her instead .
what do you think about that , charles ?
i think ,
you &apos;re fishing .
and i hate fish .
how &apos;s he doing ?
i think he &apos;s making progress .
i &apos;m surprised none of them have lawyered up yet .
tina and lyle haven &apos;t because they know they &apos;re innocent .
charles is a sociopath .
he thinks he can talk his way out of it .
tell me about your run @-@ ins with the klan , charles .
i never ran .
well , did they stop you at a traffic light
or approach you in a bar ?
i know what it was like back then .
oh , you know what it was like ?
the guy who saved my life in vietnam was black ,
as was my second wife .
brown sugar .
i &apos;ll be damned .
i bet you phone @-@ banked for obama .
no , i was too busy putting guys like you away .
where you from , dave ?
long island .
your i @-@ talian from long island
can be as cold @-@ blooded as a ... a klansman from virginia .
you ever used the n @-@ word , dave ?
i &apos;m sure i did .
the same guys who called me wop and dago .
everyone i knew back then used that language . so what ?
maybe one day some black people
sit in the front of the bus in floral park
and you start throwing some punches .
we &apos;ve already found 3 bodies , charles .
maybe some colored folks sit next to you
at stango &apos;s back in the day ,
and , you know , you get pissed off ,
you start throwing punches at &apos; em .
you &apos;re evading , charles ,
and that suggests guilt .
oh . you go by that logic ,
you ain &apos;t too innocent your damn self .
there was this one time .
here we go .
i was in the ninth grade ,
and there was this black kid on the baseball team with me .
i knew it .
break out the peanuts .
he was the runt and i was the second @-@ smallest .
you get the picture ?
i got it . come on .
well , one day the other guys get mad
because he &apos;s playing with us ...
and they force me to shove him into a locker
and keep him there overnight .
did you do it ?
sure i did .
if not , they would have done it to me .
call him names ?
we called him every name in the book .
and then they made me pee on him in the locker .
you peed on him ?
they made me .
i didn &apos;t think it was funny at the time .
oh , it &apos;s funny . it is funny , all right .
i can &apos;t believe i did that .
oh , i believe it . i believe it .
and you know what &apos;s funnier than that ?
is you think after telling me that ,
that i &apos;m going to talk to you .
you know what you can do
with your black wife
and your black friend ?
you can kiss my black ass .
hotch , we found a fourth body buried under charles &apos; shed .
the m.e. said based upon decomposition levels ,
it looks like this guy could have been killed
around the same time james moses was .
all right , keep us posted .
i will .
so that makes two men from way back
and two women from 10 years ago .
i &apos;ve searched the members of james moses&apos;
and karl beck &apos;s klan chapter
and i found a mike mills who was killed in a car accident
quite some time before now .
he had a daughter rachel mills ,
and she was reported as missing 10 years ago .
where did she live ?
in a neighboring town . and i just pulled her dental records .
which are a match to the other victim in the backyard .
when did her father die ?
from the car accident ? 20 years ago .
so first charles kills the two men ,
then years later his son
coincidentally starts dating mary ann beck
and it triggers him to kill again .
when he found out her father was dead ,
he killed mary ann instead ,
then he did the same thing to mike mills &apos; daughter .
that confirms your theory about a vendetta .
let &apos;s find out if these men knew charles .
none of them are in his yearbook .
garcia , check other schools in the area .
vegetarian hot dog with sauerkraut and pickles .
karl beck , mike mills , and james moses
all went to a.j. burroughs high school ,
just two towns over from where charles went to school .
he graduated a year prior to them .
garcia , check with their families and see
if there was any sort of altercation or feud
between charles and these men .
none of the men &apos;s parents are still living ,
and none of them have any brothers or sisters .
what about half @-@ siblings ?
ok . ok .
shazam ! karl beck had a half @-@ sister , audrey collins .
did she go to burroughs ?
no , but she &apos;s in charles &apos; yearbook .
so charles and audrey went to school together .
garcia , check and see if she &apos;s still in the area .
oh . audrey collins died from cancer 35 years ago ,
exactly 4 weeks before the disappearance of james moses .
she died and charles started killing .
which confirms our theory that charles had two triggers--
audrey &apos;s death , and 25 years later ,
seeing his son with mary ann beck .
garcia , find out everything you can about audrey collins .
she &apos;s the key to the case .
look--
you don &apos;t have to explain , man .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
a locker ?
really ? you took a leak on the guy ?
i was working him , derek .
but i &apos;d like you to do something for me .
send the black guy in .
huh . i was wondering
when they were gonna play that card .
attention all fbi employees ,
will the one negro in the building
please get to the sixth floor .
you finished ?
but then again ...
you &apos;re not fully black .
are you ?
well , that &apos;s ok .
they say even one drop counts .
i want to ask you some questions .
no .
you tell that i @-@ talian from long island
to get his ass back in here .
this ain &apos;t a locker .
you can &apos;t just stuff me in here .
lyle may have seen something when he was little ,
but neither he nor his mother knew this charles .
i &apos;m going back in there .
hey , so , uh , i just spoke to audrey &apos;s stepsister .
there was an incident .
audrey wrote a letter .
ah , there you are .
thought you picked up your marbles and went home ,
hiding under the bed in shame .
what would i be ashamed of ? it happened when i was a kid .
i &apos;m different now .
people don &apos;t change .
oh , i &apos;ve changed .
audrey collins changed .
&quot; dear charles , this is audrey collins .
years ago i told a lie and destroyed you . &quot;
you can &apos;t prove a thing .
audrey collins went to school with you , charles .
so what ?
she wrote you a letter on her death bed ,
admitting she told a lie .
what was she lying about , charles ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , you know .
it caused 6 klansmen to snatch you off the street that night .
she said you raped her , didn &apos;t she ?
i would never rape a woman .
no , you would just humiliate them and cut them up .
that &apos;s not what i did .
you &apos;re lying .
no . no . she lied .
then what did she lie about , charles ?
she was fooling around with a white guy
on the football team , and , um ...
when she came home past her curfew ...
she said that i raped her .
what did they do to you that night ?
there he is .
that &apos;s him .
get him !
no !
get him up there .
come on !
they grabbed me ...
dragged me out into a field .
let me go ! please !
get out of there ! get down ! shut up !
you laid your hands on my sister !
i &apos;ll lay my hands on you !
come on ! i didn &apos;t do anything !
stop !
we got a tree for you , boy .
let me go !
you &apos;re gonna fly tonight .
no !
no ...
no !
no ! no !
no !
please !
hung me from a tree .
cut me .
where did they cut you ?
where do you think ?
and that &apos;s why you take testosterone .
they castrated you .
i wanted a big family .
you killed all those people for revenge .
no , i killed out of hate .
yeah .
hate grew in me that night .
and hate vowed to pay them all back .
and audrey &apos;s letter triggered this .
she ruined my life , she writes me a letter ?
and that &apos;s why you mutilated your victims .
they were lucky .
they were already dead .
what about the lives you destroyed ?
your son &apos;s . your wife &apos;s .
i didn &apos;t do that . audrey .
all audrey had to do
was tell the truth at the time .
not everyone has the guts to tell the truth .
have you told lyle that he &apos;s not your biological son ?
no . and you better not !
please .
what difference does it make ?
you &apos;ve already ruined his life .
he saw you murder someone at 5 .
you killed his girlfriend .
you didn &apos;t have to pass along your genes .
you passed along your rage .
is that what you really wanted to do ?
no .
then make it right , charles .
audrey said that 6 guys dragged you into the woods .
we &apos;ve only found 4 bodies .
you give me your full confession
and i &apos;ll keep your secret .
come on , rossi , shove him in there .
