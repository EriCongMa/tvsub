i can &apos;t believe my little brother &apos;s married !
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were eloping ?
well , we were at court , eating lunch
why were you at the courthouse ?
we were having lunch .
we were like ...
... we &apos;re here , we &apos;re having lunch . let &apos;s get married ! right ?
a year ago , i didn &apos;t know i had a brother . now i have a sister !
oh , it &apos;s so great .
okay .
okay .
stop it ! don &apos;t !
i &apos;ll get you a gift now .
is there anything you need ?
we &apos;ve been trying to get pregnant since we got engaged , to get a jump on things .
no one &apos;s getting any younger .
because the thing is , we &apos;re not able to , you know , conceive .
we &apos;ve seen a bunch of doctors .
they say that our only chance to have a baby ...
... is that if they take my sperm , her egg , put it together in a dish ...
... and put it into another girl .
we were wondering if you could be that girl .
that &apos;s a really nice gift .
i was thinking of a gravy boat .
we know it &apos;s a lot to ask .
we don &apos;t have anyone else to go to . ...
we could pay someone ... but we don &apos;t have that kind of money .
plus , you know , you &apos;re family and , you know ...
... i just don &apos;t want my baby to grow into some chick i don &apos;t know , you know ?
don &apos;t give us an answer yet , think about it .
and if you say no , we &apos;ll totally understand .
okay . okay .
and we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station .
well , actually , we kind of need an answer to that one right now .
the one with phoebe &apos;s uterus
check it out ! guess what job i just got .
i don &apos;t know , but donald trump wants his blue blazer black .
what ?
blue blazer back . he wants it back .
you said &quot; black . &quot; why would he want his blue blazer black ?
well , you know what i meant .
you messed it up .
you &apos;re stupid .
so , what job did you get ?
tour guide at the museum . ross got it for me .
don &apos;t you have to be a dinosaur expert ?
they give you all the information .
it &apos;s like memorizing a script .
on your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex , from the jurassic period .
very nice .
yeah , actually , joey , it &apos;s the cretaceous period .
but i can pronounce jurassic .
frank jr. and alice got married !
oh , my god !
they &apos;re having a baby !
they want me to grow it for them in my uterus !
my god !
are you serious ?
ya !
you &apos;re thinking of having sex with your brother ?
ew ! and , oh , no !
they want me to be the surrogate .
it &apos;s her egg and his sperm . i &apos;m the oven . it &apos;s their bun .
what did you say ?
i had to think about it first , but what is there to think of ?
i &apos;ll be giving someone the greatest gift .
you &apos;ll carry their child and get them a sony playstation ?
this is an incredible thing to do .
but there are things to think about .
yeah , you &apos;d be pregnant . i mean , pregnant .
i know .
you &apos;ll put your body through an awful lot .
i mean , morning sickness , labor .
it &apos;s all for somebody else .
yeah . what &apos;s your point ?
well , the stuff i just mentioned .
i couldn &apos;t do that .
i always figured the first time i had a baby , it &apos;d be with someone i love .
and that baby was , you know ...
... a keeper .
you were more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture .
if you decide to do this , we &apos;ll be supportive like crazy .
just think it through .
talk to somebody who &apos;s had a baby . like your mom .
my mom never gave birth . oh ! but my birth mom did !
i love this tushy ! can i take it to work with me ?
yeah , sure . it &apos;s not mine anyway . it came with the pants .
i am so jealous .
you guys are just right there .
yes .
right where ?
the beginning , where it &apos;s all sex and talking ...
... and sex and talking .
you got to love the talking .
and the sex ?
we haven &apos;t had sex .
what &apos;s the big deal ? this is special .
i want our love to grow before moving to the next level .
oh , chandler , that is so nice .
that is really nice ...
... iying !
no way is that the reason .
why ?
because you &apos;re not mature enough to understand that ?
he &apos;s right . i &apos;m totally lying .
then what is it ?
kathy &apos;s last boyfriend was joey .
and you &apos;re afraid you won &apos;t be able to fill his shoes ?
i &apos;m afraid i won &apos;t make love as well as him .
i was going for the metaphor .
i was saying the actual words .
he &apos;s had a lot of girlfriends . doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s great in bed .
we share a wall .
either he &apos;s great , or she liked to agree with him a lot .
loudly and a lot .
all night long she &apos;d agree .
it &apos;ll be different . the sex will be great because you &apos;re in love .
really ?
ya !
just go for it .
yeah , you should .
all right . i &apos;ll sleep with my girlfriend .
but i &apos;m just doing it for you guys .
now , the mastodon is from the semi @-@ late jurassic period .
isn &apos;t the mastodon from the pliocene epoch ?
this is a museum . no talking .
right down here we have ...
... a large foot .
and over here we have ross geller .
everyone wave &quot; hi &quot; to ross .
ross is one of our scientists . look at him hard at work .
okay , moving right along .
come on .
it &apos;s open . come in .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
that &apos;s okay .
i had time to finish glazing my nipples .
you go all out when you &apos;re expecting company .
i was working on my pottery .
oh ! i didn &apos;t know that you did pot .
mostly nudes . it combines my two passions : pottery and erotica .
erottery !
thanks for coming out to see me .
i thought it &apos;d be a good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
why not ?
you &apos;d be giving up a baby .
and i really don &apos;t
i don &apos;t know if anything i said would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby .
so
no , no , i understand the pain . don &apos;t hurt the puppy !
no , no . the puppy is yours .
i get a puppy ?
but for only three days .
why ?
i realize i don &apos;t have any right to start getting parent @-@ y on you now .
look at me and not the puppy . it &apos;s very important .
okey
i know what i &apos;m talking about .
i gave up two babies .
i only wish i had someone who &apos;d given up babies that told me ...
... how terrible it is .
i really shouldn &apos;t have given you the puppy first .
that &apos;s okay . no , we &apos;re listening .
it &apos;d be something you &apos;d regret every day for the rest of your life .
so however hard it is for you to give up this puppy ...
... it &apos;d be a million times harder to give up a child .
okay , fair enough . three days .
oh , it &apos;s time to take my ass out of the kiln .
could you sit there ? i &apos;m saving this seat for my friend ross .
you mean dr. geller ?
doctor ? i didn &apos;t know he had a nickname .
oh , he won &apos;t sit here .
only people in white coats sit there .
only people in blue blazers sit here .
how come ?
that &apos;s just the way it is .
that &apos;s crazy .
maybe it &apos;s crazy in a perfect world : a world without lab coats and blazers .
but you not in a perfect world . you in a museum now .
see that scientist ?
he and i used to play together in grade school , but now ....
peter ! hey , peter !
it &apos;s me ! rhonda , from p.s. 129 ?
i shared my pudding with you , man !
i gave you my snack pack !
see ? he pretend he don &apos;t even hear me !
everyone &apos;s pretending they don &apos;t hear you .
i don &apos;t know about your jackets and separate tables ...
... but ross is my friend .
and if i save him a seat , he will sit in it .
here ! i saved you a seat !
i &apos;m cool here . i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
this is saved .
gift shop .
i &apos;m really , really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today .
you do what you got to do .
the scientists and the tour guides never sit together .
whatever .
it &apos;s like that everywhere . mon , back me up .
where you work , the waiters eat with the waiters .
and the chefs eat with the other chefs ?
i eat by myself in the alley , because everybody hates me .
okay , rach , when was the last time you had lunch with the shipping clerks ?
i &apos;ve never had lunch with the shipping clerks ... but it &apos;s totally different .
they &apos;re not allowed in the executive cafeteria .
oh , i see what you &apos;re saying .
look , ross .
it &apos;s no big deal .
you wear a white coat . i wear a blue blazer .
if that means we can &apos;t be friends at work , so be it .
i understand , you know ?
when i &apos;m in a play and you &apos;re in the audience , i don &apos;t talk to you .
so it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s cool .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
when we &apos;re in the audience , he doesn &apos;t talk but he does wave .
who &apos;s my puppy ? who &apos;s my puppy ? who &apos;s my puppy ?
have you named him yet ?
no , i don &apos;t want to get attached .
can i hold him ?
sure . here .
come here , squirmy . hello
not like that . no .
why &apos;s phoebe singing to karl malden ?
i think it &apos;s time for puppy to go out again .
come on , let &apos;s go to the balcony .
the street . come on , let &apos;s go to the street .
don &apos;t go on the balcony until after i get back .
so did you do it ?
yes , yes , we had the sex .
it was bad ?
it was fine , but she didn &apos;t agree with me as strongly as with joey .
she was like , &quot; l see your point . i &apos;m all right with it . &quot;
there &apos;s not always a lot of agreement the first time .
yeah . not for girls , anyway . guys agree like that .
look , you have to help me .
i mean ....
i know what to do with a woman . it &apos;s always nice .
i need to know ...
... what makes it go from nice to :
&quot; my god ! somebody &apos;s killing her in there ! &quot;
i &apos;ll show you something a lot of guys don &apos;t know .
rach , give me that pad , please ?
all right .
now .
you don &apos;t have to draw an actual whoa , she &apos;s hot !
everyone knows the erogenous zones .
you got one , two , three ...
... four ...
... five , six and seven .
there are seven ?
let me see that .
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s one ?
kind of an important one .
i was looking at it upside down .
well , you know , sometimes that helps .
most guys will hit one , two , three and then go to seven and set up camp .
that &apos;s bad ?
at disneyland , you don &apos;t spend the whole day on the matterhorn .
you might if it were like seven .
all right , the important thing is to take your time .
you want to hit them all ...
... mix them up . keep them on their toes .
oh , toes !
for some people .
all right .
you could start out with a little one .
a two .
a one , two , three .
a three .
a five .
a four .
a three , two .
two . a two , four , six .
two , four , six .
four . two .
two . four , seven !
five , seven ! six , seven !
seven ! seven ! ...
and there you are .
yeah , that &apos;ll work .
dr. geller ? there &apos;s a seat here .
thank you , dr. phillips .
but i &apos;m having my lunch ...
... at this table . here in the middle .
i &apos;m having my lunch ...
... right here with my good friend , joey .
if he &apos;ll sit with me .
i will sit with you , dr. geller .
you know ...
... we work in a museum of natural history .
and yet , there is something ...
... unnatural ...
... about the way we eat lunch .
now , i want you to know .... it took a tour guide to show this scientist
the error of his ways
you might even say he took me on a tour ... of myself .
yeah , that was me .
i look around , and you know what i see ? i see division .
division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers .
i ask myself , &quot; my god , why ? &quot;
now , i say we shed these coats ...
... that separate us .
and we get to know the people underneath .
i &apos;m ross !
i &apos;m divorced and i have a kid !
i &apos;m joey ! i &apos;m an actor !
i don &apos;t know squat about dinosaurs !
i &apos;m ted , and i just moved here , and new york really scares me .

my mom &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t give him up .
yes , no . i can .
i don &apos;t want to .
but i can .
no .
i can &apos;t watch this . it &apos;s like sophie &apos;s choice .
you know , i never saw that .
oh , it was only okay .
i can &apos;t do this .
my mom was right . if i can &apos;t give him up ...
... there &apos;s no way i can give up a baby .
frank and alice are going to be so crushed .
what else can i give them ? a kidney !
we were in the neighborhood .
we want to let you know that there &apos;s still no pressure .
if there was something you wanted to say , we &apos;ll be right there .
okey
who &apos;s this little guy ?
he &apos;s so cute ! he reminds me of my old dog , tumor .
you are so precious , i could take you home .
why don &apos;t you ?
are you serious ?
yeah .
thanks .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m okay with this .
you know why ? because look at them .
look how happy they are .
and i made that , so you know ....
it &apos;ll be a million times harder to give up a baby , but oh , my god !
it &apos;ll feel a million times better , right ?
i &apos;ll do this . i want to carry your baby .
thank you so much !
you don &apos;t know what this means to us .
i think i &apos;m going to cry !

i gave them the puppy .
it made them so happy , i decided to carry their baby .
phoebe

we &apos;re different , though .
this is a different situation .
i am not going to regret this .
i understand all that .
