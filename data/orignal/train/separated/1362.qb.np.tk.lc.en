it &apos;s good to see you . how &apos;s everything been ?
you , too . i &apos;m ready . i &apos;m ready .
you have the gift ?
here we go . boom ! there you go .
oh , my god .
look at that , oh ! it &apos;s amazing !
oh , my god . i love it .
hey , if you like the way it looks , that &apos;s all tory .
i love my new necklace .
thank you .
you &apos;re ...
welcome .
she not ...
appreciate tory .

what i do doesn &apos;t matter , ten mohs .
it &apos;s you that everyone cares about .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m ...
ten mohs ? you okay ?
not .
no ...
give me that again ?
yo , ten mohs ! what &apos;s happening , man ?
i &apos;ll get 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
not !
good morning .
good morning .
i got a new t @-@ shirt .
you can borrow something of mine .
oh , they say we should learn to live with less .
don &apos;t listen to &quot; they . &quot;
the ...
&quot; a.i. &quot; ?
artificial intelligence .
you &apos;re getting a call from the future .
it &apos;s actually from the past .
it &apos;s my father . arthur .
frere jacques , frere jacques ?
dormez @-@ vous ? dormez @-@ vous ?
do you want me to answer it ?
nope .
sonnez les matines , sonnez les matines
ding , ding , dong , ding , ding , dong .
well , that was interesting .
i just can &apos;t be bothered right now .
you &apos;re here dealing with the effects of a fire
that destroyed all your personal stuff ,
not to mention a lifetime of memories .
i lost 20 identical t @-@ shirts .
you lost a lot more than that .
okay , is this , like , some new therapy ?
like a &quot; shove it in your face &quot; kind of thing ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s awesome .
i did not mean to . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
faulty wiring . moving on . i &apos;m fine .
well , i don &apos;t know why you won &apos;t stay at my guest room .
that hotel mattress is killing your back .
i stayed in your guest room for four days .
and if i would &apos;ve stayed one more day ...
i would have missed the weekend series .
and that &apos;s not gonna happen . no , it isn &apos;t .
which weekend series ?
the ... red sox / angels .
uh , wanted to see that fish kid play .
uh , trout .
oh , he &apos;s a cutie .
that &apos;s what i like in my ballplayers .
cutie @-@ ness .
okay , you aren &apos;t staying because of your mother ?
what ? huh ?
uh ... nothing . we were just talking about --
i &apos;m gonna change up my look .
what do you think about pastels ?
well , how about something with a collar ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
what ? why ?
yeah . what ? ! why ? !
rizzoli .
i don &apos;t understand you two .
ma , thank you . been very helpful .
your father &apos;s calling .
all right .
you think you &apos;re so clever .
isles .
you do .
it &apos;s not like i don &apos;t appreciate her concern ,
but she just kept ... touching my head .
you could ask her to stop .
and then ask her to stop the other 100 things
that made me wanna go to a hotel ?
your mother is a wonderful and caring woman .
yes , unlike your father arthur .
i never said arthur wasn &apos;t wonderful .
no , you don &apos;t say anything about him at all .
and you call him &quot; arthur . &quot;
it &apos;s his name .
he traveled a lot . there isn &apos;t much to tell .
why is he calling ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t answer .
what do you got ?
teddy marshall .
a.k.a. , ten mohs .
maximum hardness on a gemmological scale .
jeweler to the rich and famous .
how famous ?
rappers , athletes ,
young people with a lot of money
and no understanding of understatement .
according to his bodyguard ,
ten mohs was having a great night .
top dog in the v.i.p. room ,
buying champagne for his adoring public .
then he starts talking gibberish ,
walks in here , and dies .
stroke ?
well , it &apos;s possible ,
but there &apos;s signs of acute cyanosis ,
which are not usually present in stroke or cardiac arrest .
let me guess . all the partygoers
ran out when he called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 ?
like the wind .
kitchen staff ?
what &apos;s faster than the wind ?
kitchen staff with visa problems ?
he sparkles .
what , like he was too close to a stripper ?
well , doesn &apos;t look like glitter ,
but i &apos;m not well @-@ versed in makeup of that ... sort .
can we -- can we move him ?
sure .
wanna help me with this ?
carrying a gun didn &apos;t get him killed ,
but maybe the reason he was carrying a gun did .
the safe hasn &apos;t been touched .
there are thousands of dollars worth of gems
just lying in these drawers .
if it wasn &apos;t about money , why would anyone kill him ?
well , we don &apos;t know that he was murdered , ms. garret .
he was young , healthy , didn &apos;t do drugs , only drank a little .
what else could &apos;ve happened ?
that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to figure out , tory .
no , they &apos;re he talking to me , which is doing nothing .
and whoever killed him is gonna come for me next .
why would you be a target ?
ten mohs and i were partners .
he found the gems . i designed the jewelry .
made a great team . revenues were up 200 % this year .
so that means someone else was down that equal amount .
and ten mohs couldn &apos;t resist rubbing their noses in it .
is that why he was carrying an unlicensed handgun ?
yeah , but ... it &apos;s also part of the image .
could you give us the names of these other jewelers ?
of course . um ...
maurice , the eightmans ,
cheeky ,
hugh and todd ,
and we practically drove blingman out of business
two months ago .
could you give us their real names , please ?
i can make some calls .
thank you . that &apos;d be very helpful .
oh , i &apos;ve been thinking about your wardrobe ,
and i was wrong about starting with ensembles .
you &apos;re not an ensemble person .
you just need a few high quality pieces ,
and we &apos;ll build from there .
i just need a new pair of pants --
is this why you brought me down here ?
no .
ten mohs ingested an s.t.x. neurotoxin
that blocked the transmission of signals
between his body and brain ,
causing paralysis to the voluntary muscles .
so he couldn &apos;t breathe ?
well , other things happened , too , but that &apos;s why he died .
and where does one get this s.t.x. neurotoxin ?
well , shellfish contaminated with toxic algae blooms ,
puffer fish .
wait a minute . isn &apos;t that that sushi
that you can &apos;t eat &apos; cause it &apos;ll kill you ?
yes , if it &apos;s not well prepared .
as little as 25 milligrams could be fatal .
well , he could &apos;ve had that voluntarily .
well , it wasn &apos;t on the club &apos;s menu .
but that &apos;s not a surprise .
in japan , chefs have to be licensed to serve it .
so a black market puffer fish ?
so if he didn &apos;t eat it voluntarily ,
it would &apos;ve been very easy to hide in an oyster shooter ,
which was the only thing he ate or drank last night .
diamonds ... on his fingers and in his stomach .
hmm . a high refractive index of diamonds
would explain the shimmer on the fingers .
i sent a tech over to the club .
apparently , our mr. ten mohs likes his drinks spiked
with gypsum dust from the gems he &apos;s cut for his clients .
uh , it &apos;s not mr. ten mohs . it &apos;s just &quot; ten mohs . &quot;
oh . right . like &quot; cher . &quot;
no . nothing like that .
cher is amazing .
ten mohs is just silly .
so do the diamond flakes
have anything to do with why he &apos;s dead ?
no . just a little factoid plated for your edification .
thank you , kent .
you two should get married , and then have children
that get their butts kicked on the tetherball court .
mike &quot; cheeky &quot; jones . did two years for assault .
licensed to carry a concealed weapon .
desean and reggie fournier , a.k.a. the eightmans ,
are college graduates and registered brokers .
and completely ridiculous .
oh , yeah .
all this research made me wanna call their mamas .
hugh and todd are actually named hugh and todd .
minor drug @-@ related charges .
marvin harris , a.k.a. &quot; blingman , &quot;
just filed for personal bankruptcy .
tha &apos;s motive . and we know where the name &quot; blingman &quot; comes from .
the dictionary , under &quot; subtlety . &quot;
that &apos;s all i got , except ten mohs gets sued a lot ,
including by millie juarez .
she &apos;s the mother of his child .
after she had the baby , she filed a bunch of suits
regarding support and custody issues .
always withdrew them , but ...
could be she had a habit of shaking him down .
maybe . but their texts , at least the ones i found ,
are very cordial .
and ten mohs is up to date on all his child support payments .
what about the other lawsuits ?
mostly nuisance suits . there was one civil suit .
he &apos;s being sued for theft of a --
erase another one from the chalkboard .
we have a chalkboard ?
we used to . it was very satisfying .
uniforms are bringing in the guy named blingman .
that &apos;s not his real name .
maybe not , but he &apos;s a real suspect .
he &apos;s telling anyone who &apos;ll listen
that he killed ten mohs .
that &apos;s a black diamond , isn &apos;t it ?
ten mohs specialty ?
trashy bullshit specialty .
the whole point of a diamond is the sparkle .
there &apos;s no sparkle there .
it &apos;s black . it don &apos;t know how to sparkle .
man , marvin , you must &apos;ve been something
before ten mohs ran you out of business .
people get tired of those things ,
and blingman will be ready .
blingman will be in jail .
not a great retail environment .
i &apos;m not going to jail .
you didn &apos;t do it .
you said it .
okay , i want you to write down how you killed ten mohs .
and if you don &apos;t do it ,
i &apos;m gonna go out on the street and tell everybody
how you cried like a baby when you got in here .
go ahead . just write down how you did it .
&quot; i , blingman , killed ten mohs , that punk . &quot;
it lacks detail . try again .
you &apos;re just trying to get some street cred .
he made me look like a fool .
you are a fool .
at least i &apos;m on the up @-@ and @-@ up . that guy -- he was shady .
what kind of shady ?
you don &apos;t get diamonds at those prices
unless you &apos;re helping people move things
that are hard to move .
you &apos;re saying he was working for the drug cartel ?
as i said , trashy bullshit .
too bad it isn &apos;t a crime to be stupid .
the prisons would be full , the streets would be empty .
yeah .
ten mohs was being sued
over a $ 200,000 black diamond
that a tribe from the amazon rain forest says he stole .
motive . i like it .
hey , ma . what &apos;s up ? i &apos;m working .
the trial starts in three days ,
and we just found out that the lead plaintiff ,
a tribal elder named raya ,
arrived in boston yesterday .
opportunity . love it .
we have an address on this guy ?
all right , all right ,
i &apos;ll be down in the lobby in two minutes .
technically , talking to your mother isn &apos;t working .
she needs me .
you know , i don &apos;t have time for this .
for what ?
we &apos;re having a meeting .
about what ? i didn &apos;t prep for a meeting .
no prep necessary .
look , jane &apos;s been through a lot .
she needs us to figure out how we can help her .
she told me all she needs is pants .
no , she needs to get out of that hotel .
true .
otherwise , she &apos;s gonna become stooped and grumpy .
true .
okay , so we &apos;re in agreement .
i &apos;ll move in with frankie ,
and jane will move into the guesthouse .
w @-@ what now ? i did not agree to that .
i just agreed that
i don &apos;t want jane to end up stooped and grumpy .
look , frankie , it &apos;s the only thing that makes sense .
after what she &apos;s been through ,
she needs privacy and space
to figure out what she &apos;s gonna do next ,
and she needs the love and support
of her friends and family .
beautifully said , angela .
thank you .
et tu , maura ?
you &apos;re a good boy .
great meeting .
i &apos;m gonna be sad if this guy admits it
and we don &apos;t have to work tonight .
you need the overtime ?
no , i j- my hotel is uncomfortable .
and lonely .
you can come stay with me .
oh , yeah . like i wanna listen to you
talk goofy to kiki all night on the phone .
no , thank you .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m detective korsak . boston homicide .
this is detective rizzoli . we &apos;re looking for raya .
why ?
well , i think that &apos;s between him and us .
well , i &apos;m sorry . he &apos;s not here . perhaps you can come back later ?
you know what ?
i think we &apos;ll wait here ,
if that &apos;s okay with you , mister ...
doctor .
dr. arthur isles .
so you ...
work with maura then ?
yes . and you &apos;re in town ?
yes .
uh , i come to boston regularly .
when will raya be back ?
why would homicide detectives be looking for raya ?
well , it &apos;s an ongoing investigation .
the victim is teddy marshall , a.k.a. ten mohs .
oh . my .
we know about the lawsuit .
and you think raya may have killed him .
because of &quot; the darkness &quot; ?
excuse me ?
a diamond known as &quot; the darkness . &quot;
it &apos;s a 20 @-@ karat black diamond
of great cultural importance to the sororo people .
uh , we just wanna ask him a few questions .
the diamond was stolen ,
and the sororo have taken legal and appropriate steps
to secure its return .
if that &apos;s the case , then he has nothing to worry about .
what exactly is your connection to all of this ?
i have lived and worked on and off over 20 years
with the sororo people .
they needed an intermediary to pursue their legal case .
i agreed to be that person .
while it is true that raya had motive to kill this ten mohs ,
he didn &apos;t do it .
how can you be so sure ?
well , other than the sightseeing trip he took an hour ago ,
he &apos;s been with me since his arrival in boston .
i &apos;d have noticed something .
all the same ,
i &apos;d like you to give us a call when he comes back .
it &apos;s very nice to meet you , dr. isles .
even under the circumstances , thank you kindly .
you are not gonna believe who i just ran into .
tommy .
no .
the family that adopted jo friday .
no .
the chef that &apos;s building
out the restaurant down the street .
mnh @-@ mnh .
tasha .
nope .
that sox fellow you like so much ?
okay , i obviously don &apos;t know .
i just ran into the other dr. isles .
oh . i &apos;m glad .
that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re glad ?
i assume nothing bad happened to him ,
or you would &apos;ve been much more compassionate .
your father is buddy @-@ buddy with a murder suspect .
okay , really ? we &apos;re just not gonna talk about this at all ?
talk about what ?
the fact that &quot; your father &quot; and &quot; murder &quot;
are in the same sentence .
we talk about murder all the time .
okay , it &apos;s obvious that something is going on
between you and your father and has been for a long time ...
because you have absolutely no poker face .
yes , i do .
have you ever beat me in cards ?
no .
look , maura , i just want you to know
that , as your friend , if you need me , i &apos;m here .
he &apos;s a liar .
your father ?
whatever he says , it &apos;s never the whole truth .
it may not even be part of the truth .
i didn &apos;t find much .
all right , show me what you got .
he appears to be a busy guy with a high tolerance for bugs .
years of field research in the amazon rain forest .
must &apos;ve been hard on her with him gone so much .
yeah .
so what &apos;s his story on this trip to boston ?
his passport entered the country at the same time as raya &apos;s ,
and so far , it looks like they &apos;ve eaten all their meals
in the hotel .
raya doesn &apos;t have a cell phone ,
and we &apos;re not gonna get a warrant for dr. isles &apos; , so ...
so we can &apos;t confirm if they were in the hotel .
okay , what about the security video at the club ?
are either one of them on it ?
they aren &apos;t , but there are no cameras in the kitchen ,
and the staff leaves the door to the alley open .
would &apos;ve been easy enough to sneak in .
okay . thanks .
jane .
yeah ?
three large checks just hit ten mohs &apos; bank account
they &apos;re dated for today .
who &apos;s writing checks for a dead guy ?
millie juarez , the mother of his baby .
she lives on the east side .
frankie and korsak are canvassing raya &apos;s hotel .
it &apos;s in that area . i &apos;ll call &apos; em .
how did she think she &apos;d get away
with writing those checks to herself
after ten mohs was dead ?
yeah . and be smart . always backdate your crime .
you know ... if you and i went rogue ,
i think we &apos;d make pretty good criminals .
you ?
yeah .
the guy who hates to cut in line ?
well , i &apos;m not saying i &apos;m going to the dark side ,
but ... i think i &apos;d be pretty good at it .
if i wanted to , which i don &apos;t .
what &apos;s that ?
what ?
somebody over there .
boston p.d. !
drop it !
don &apos;t shoot ! don &apos;t shoot .
why were you trying to break into the house ?
put your hands behind your head .
before ten mohs died , he said , &quot; shoot her . &quot;
you thought he meant millie ?
she had been at the club earlier ,
shaking him down for extra child support .
did he give it to her ?
yeah , he agreed to give her 25 % more .
get on up .
gave her a bunch of signed checks .
maybe those checks she cashed
were her way of getting what she &apos;s owed .
ten mohs is dead .
you still thought you had to follow through ?
i wasn &apos;t gonna hurt her . that baby needs his mom .
i just thought i &apos;d scare her a little .
he said &quot; shooter , &quot; not &quot; shoot her . &quot;
what ?
shooter .
like ... oyster shooter .
he must &apos;ve realized one of them was bad
when his lips went numb .
oh , i ... i thought he ...
well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know he meant ...
i really miss ten mohs .
there you go .
there i go . where am i going ?
that is the d.n.a. signature
of a fresh water puffer fish found in the amazon .
that is the d.n.a. signature
of the puffer fish that killed ten mohs .
jeez ! what the hell ? !
puffer fish actually taste quite delicious .
what are you doing ? !
i was ... looking for my pen ? little tense , are we ?
little weird , are we ?
it actually ... just tastes like chicken .
any more questions ?
so many .
all right , fine , i &apos;ll be getting back to my work then .
i mean , i don &apos;t wanna paint the entire country
with just one brush ... but the scottish guy ? weird .
that &apos;s not important right now .
okay .
read this .
&quot; fish toxins &amp; hunting methods -- an ethnological survey . &quot;
that article is my father &apos;s phd
in killing things with puffer fish toxins .
you don &apos;t think your father killed ten mohs , do you ?
no .
no , i just ...
some people use these to go up and down .
hello .
everything all right ?
yeah . i was thinking about family .
and murder .
anything i can do ?
yeah , you can help me with the second one .
it wasn &apos;t the mother of his baby .
she wrote the checks ,
but ten mohs gave them to her signed .
she has five she hasn &apos;t even cashed .
yeah , and then this sororo guy .
i mean , they believe in eye for an eye justice .
so maybe poisoning ten mohs with a fish found in their river
returns things to balance .
raya &apos;s in interrogation with dr. isles .
does raya speak english ?
nope . spanish .
paging senor korsak .
y tambien senorita jane .
i have no ideal what you just said ,
but let me tell you what &apos;s gonna happen .
you &apos;re gonna go in there
and you &apos;re gonna say something to him ,
and then you &apos;re gonna tell me what you said .
and then he &apos;s gonna say something to you ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell me what he said .
and then i &apos;ll say ...
see ya later .
good luck .
这里我说了算 明白吗
你的回答会起到很重要的作用
i can talk to him . you don &apos;t really need to be here .
he doesn &apos;t understand our legal system .
i &apos;m here to protect him .
它生长在你们的河里
it is outrageous that you even suggest
this man has something to do with the murder .
the sororo are known for an eye for an eye justice .
i read it here in this paper by dr. arthur isles .
that was a long time ago . their conditions have evolved .
evolution &apos;s a slow progress .
none of this ties raya to the murder .
not yet , but it makes him murder @-@ adjacent ,
and that &apos;s a bad neighborhood .
you &apos;re free to go .
officer garcia will collect your passports .
have you seen nina ?
stepped out .
all right . can you tell her i &apos;m looking for her ?
okay .
thanks .
janie !
yes . have you seen nina ?
no .
all right , i &apos;ll try her cell .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . we need to talk .
what is wrong ?
there was a meeting -- me , maura , mom .
and mom has decided that she should move in with me
so that you can live with maura .
okay . that works .
no , no , no ! it does not !
i know a really bad thing had happened to you ,
but this is an even worse thing happening to me .
mom moving in with you is worse than my apartment burning down ?
i would set myself on fire to keep this from happening .
wow . okay , well , then you need to tell mom how you feel .
i don &apos;t wanna be the guy
who tells his mother she can &apos;t move in with him .
you the guy who doesn &apos;t want his mother to move in with him .
right , but i can &apos;t say that or imply it .
well , what are you thinking , frankie ?
shadow puppets ? you wanna mime something ?
mom figures things out . she makes leaps .
like , do you remember the time when i told her
i needed a more manly deodorant ,
and she guessed that i was having sex with ann tomasino ?
okay , fine . i &apos;ll talk to her .
you will ?
yes .
thank you . oh , god , thank you . i owe you .
yes , y @-@ yes !
you do owe me . you owe me red sox tickets .
absolutely .
and two beers , a pretzel , and a foam finger .
deal . but i pick out the finger .
i already know what stupid finger you &apos;re gonna pick out .
goodbye , please !
i &apos;ll let nina know you were looking for her .
don &apos;t stop dreamin &apos; , &apos; cause it keeps you moving on .
just dream away .
kepp believin &apos; .
thanks , mom .
oh , hey ! wait , wait , wait !
listen , i think that you should stay at maura &apos;s .
what ?
what ?
yes . everything is working out for you ,
and i don &apos;t wanna displace you . it &apos;s just ...
jane &apos;s right , ma . she &apos;s never been righter .
don &apos;t displace .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
i almost ...
i got -- i got a tear in my eye .
this whole mother / daughter thing , it &apos;s really beautiful .
yeah , but if i stay at maura &apos;s , where are you gonna go ?
i &apos;ll move in with frankie .
that &apos;s fantastic !
yeah !
my children together again ! i love it !
okay , next round on me .
what the hell was that ?
she was gonna ask me where i was going .
i had to have a plan .
well , you should &apos;ve had a good plan .
what &apos;d i miss ?
well , my life is over .
the bathroom line wasn &apos;t that long .
i &apos;m moving in with frankie .
oh , god .
i know , right ? see ? i &apos;m not the only one
who thinks that it &apos;s ...
i was just leaving , but you &apos;re welcome to stay .
i need to talk to you about your case .
doctor to doctor ?
you &apos;re not a doctor . you &apos;re a phd .
raya has a daughter -- karina .
she had access to amazonian puffer fish .
she is in boston .
your friends seem very concerned .
you should rejoin them .
karina sororo .
that &apos;s the same last name as the tribe .
when someone leaves the tribal lands ,
they take the tribe &apos;s name as their surname .
maintains a connection .
i read dr. isles &apos; other papers .
karina &apos;s a student at b.u.
she &apos;s working on her m.b.a.
that &apos;s impressive .
and she likes the nightlife .
i checked with the doorman .
she was on the v.i.p. list the night ten mohs died .
so she had access .
it gets better .
she was put on the list by ten mohs himself .
girlfriend ?
business partner .
she supplied ten mohs with diamonds .
lots of diamonds .
okay , so what do we think ?
she got scared when ten mohs wound up with the darkness
and her father found out ?
or she didn &apos;t want her father to find out ,
and she killed ten mohs to keep him quiet .
or &quot; c , &quot; she had second thoughts because her father found out ,
and they did it together .
he had deadly fish . she had access .
it &apos;s always &quot; c. &quot;
where were you in high school ?
all right , i will get a warrant for her apartment .
frankie and i will go check out
and see if she &apos;s hanging around her father &apos;s hotel .
dr. isles ?
oh , an officer said it would be okay if i waited here .
yeah , of course .
i &apos;m actually in the middle of an investigation ,
so i was just on my way out .
oh . of course .
did you need something ?
my wife , uh ...
has told me about how important you are to maura ,
how much she relies on your counsel .
if you knew who i was , why did you pretend that you didn &apos;t ?
it ...
um , seemed easier .
somehow .
i don &apos;t know .
okay , i ...
muffed that one .
but i was wondering ...
could you put in a good word for me ?
with maura ?
you know , maura gave her kidney to someone that she barely knew .
so if she &apos;s this mad , it &apos;s probably gonna take some time .
so i should ...
not give up .
maybe stop making such easy choices ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i ...
oh . i understand .
thanks for coming down to the station , ms. sororo .
we just have a few questions .
we have receipts that show
you &apos;ve been selling sororo diamonds to ten mohs for over a year .
he paid his taxes like a good tax @-@ paying hip @-@ hop jeweler .
we found it in her apartment .
did you sell him that , too ?
the darkness was found by a logger ,
someone who was already stealing from our lands .
i knew about ten mohs ,
his love for black diamonds , so i reached out to him .
to see if he wanted to buy some black diamonds ?
to see if he had any information
that could help me recover the darkness .
we met here , in boston .
we realized that we could help each other .
how ?
he liked diamonds . i had diamonds .
so i sold them to him
in exchange for helping me get the darkness back .
i read a few academic papers .
the sororo don &apos;t sell anything from their land .
which is why they starve .
i used that money to build roads and a school ,
so children could have the opportunities i had .
how &apos;d your father feel about that ?
my father hates roads .
so you killed ten mohs to keep him from outing you to your father ?
you think that i killed him ?
didn &apos;t you ?
teddy ?
no .
i was in love with him .
so whoever killed ten mohs ...
wanted it to reflect back on the sororo .
it turns out karina was at a study group
while ten mohs was downing oysters .
passed up the v.i.p. room for the library ? that &apos;s interesting .
mm , you &apos;ve seen one v.i.p. room ...
you &apos;ve seen one ?
in the ... daytime .
on my way to a dead body .
i followed up your hunch
that the murder was personal , not business .
and i checked ten mohs &apos; phone records from before he met karina .
oh . ten mohs and tory were dating .
lot of calls , lot of texts .
then they trailed off .
that &apos;s not enough to arrest her .
so ten mohs was mixing business with pleasure .
that &apos;s trouble .
not as much as mixing pleasure with pleasure .
perhaps ten mohs didn &apos;t tell tory the relationship was over .
a girl could get mighty upset if she found out on her own .
why are you here ?
ah . a list of puffer fish recipes .
don &apos;t try them without a license .
i wasn &apos;t planning on it .
yeah , neither was i , but then ...
well , that &apos;s a ... story for another day .
promise ?
that &apos;s actually a list of all the people who do have a license
to import amazonian puffer fish .
as requested .
thank you .
well , let &apos;s go see tory .
send her picture to all the importers ,
see if she bought a fish .
uh , you better hurry .
why ?
i called her about an hour ago and told her
we might need to ask her some questions about karina .
who she knows is innocent .
go to her house , make sure she &apos;s still in town .
i &apos;ll check her bank records and recent purchases .
maybe she bought a plane ticket .
all right . let &apos;s go .

let &apos;s try around back .
oh . when i travel , i usually pack clothes .
what are you doing here ?
of course , if you bring jewelry , you can trade it for clothes
or a toothbrush .
oh , no , no , no .
where she &apos;s going , they &apos;ll give her a toothbrush .
you know , if you &apos;re going to the airport ...
you are gonna pay extra for this one .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
the jewels are traveling alone ?
given all that &apos;s been happening ,
i thought it best to close up and secure the inventory .
you never told us you were dating ten mohs .
a lot of people dated ten mohs .
yes , but karina was a threat .
she loved him .
so did you .
loving ten mohs isn &apos;t a crime .
where is your aquarium ?
i don &apos;t have an aquarium .
the clerk from the store i.d. &apos; d you .
he said that you bought 20 puffer fish .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of teddy marshall .
here &apos;s your nice , shiny , new bracelet .
allow me .
you have the right to remain silent .
ms. sororo , you &apos;re free to go .
is my dad waiting for me ?
yes . he &apos;s in the lobby .
he &apos;ll sit there for days if he has to .
the sororo don &apos;t use the future tense .
now is forever , and that &apos;s a problem .
someday , i &apos;ll be the leader of the sororo .
i think about that -- the future . he doesn &apos;t .
so you think he &apos;s waiting down there to argue with you ?
yes .
you &apos;ve made hard choices before .
i &apos;m not sure i believe
that &apos;s what you &apos;re really worried about .
i was going to tell my father
about my relationship with ten mohs ...
after the trial .
now you never need to tell him .
you think he deserves to know the truth ?
i don &apos;t have a daughter .
but if i did , i &apos;d want her to be straight with me .
you know ? go talk to him .
we really need him out of the lobby .
janie , we can make this work ,
but we just have to lay down some ground rules .
ground rules ?
like for instance , see that drawer ?
don &apos;t open it .
okay .
ah ! see ?
that ... was a test . you failed .
now you will never know the location of my secret drawer .
can i use your computer ?
of course .
good . i &apos;m gonna stay at a hotel .
no , no , no . stop , stop , stop .
look , we can do this . we just have a few more rules .
all right ?
okay .
dishes in the sink , rinsed .
if you finish my cereal , replace it .
and please ...
don &apos;t dry your ... brassiere in my shower .
okay , please don &apos;t ever say the word &quot; brassiere , &quot; francis .
don &apos;t call me that .
fine , franklin .
that &apos;s not even my name .
well , can i open the door ,
or is there a rule against that , too ?
hey ! glad you &apos;re here .
you can help me find frankie &apos;s porn drawer .
it &apos;s a secret drawer .
that means it &apos;s weird porn .
hey , maura .
don &apos;t touch her brassiere .
why would he touch my brassiere ?
he &apos;s got a thing .
i don &apos;t have a thing .
can i talk to you ? privately .
yeah . sure .
um , please , come into my secret tiny , tiny , room .
that &apos;s not it .
you better hide your secret tiny , tiny porn .
um ... wow . you weren &apos;t kidding .
no , i was not .
okay . what &apos;s up ?
what i say cannot leave this room .
what you say cannot fit in this room .
when i was 14,
my best friend , uh , carice jaquard --
she lived next door .
and one day , she didn &apos;t show up for school .
so on my way home , i thought i would stop by ,
see if she wanted to know what the homework was .
mnh , she didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
so i knocked on the door . nobody answered .
i went inside , i went up the stairs ,
and i saw mrs. jaquard &apos;s door open .
i could see her inside , lying on the bed ,
pulling up the sheets ...
as arthur came out , buttoning up his shirt .
up until then , he was ...
a hero to me .
he broke my heart .
oh , maura .
so he ...
begged me not to say anything .
i didn &apos;t , to anyone .
but not telling my mother ...
keeping it inside , it ...
it feels like that lie is still inside ,
like living in there .
i think that &apos;s why i have such a hard time
not telling the truth , why i break out in hives .
well ... i love that you can &apos;t tell a lie .
but you think i &apos;m a coward .
what ? no . why ?
because i &apos;m avoiding him ,
not confronting him about it .
maura , i live in a 2x3 room
in order to avoid living with my mother .
you were a child ,
and he put you in a terrible position .
but it was so long ago .
you want me to shoot him ?
i do . i really do .
okay .
but instead , maybe i &apos;ll talk to him first .
fine , but let me know if you change your mind .
we &apos;ll see how the talk goes .
otherwise , you are very good at shooting my relatives .
let &apos;s go find frankie &apos;s secret drawer .
i heard that !
oh , we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
come on !
