it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
and then what do they get ? bling ?

hello .
it &apos;s me .
where are you ? are you close ?
let &apos;s do it over the phone .
no word yet .
no one knows where our friend is .
it &apos;s not that there &apos;s no word , it &apos;s that there &apos;s no progress .
nobody &apos;s taking this lightly , phil .
he should have been done first .
they thought they &apos;d find them both at the strip joint .
i &apos;ve heard this already .
i know you &apos;re disappointed , phil .
i can hear it in everything you say .
fucking a i &apos;m disappointed .
i &apos;m thinking .
i don &apos;t know . maybe ...
we can &apos;t go back . are you out of your fucking mind ?
no , i know .
then what did you say it for ?
i didn &apos;t , phil . you did .
listen , kid ,
when this is over we &apos;re gonna sit down ,
me and you .
i hope so .
i can &apos;t hear you . you &apos;re breaking up .
i said i hope ...
ferrara &apos;s .

i need to watch my weight .
i need to snag another husband .
you &apos;re the only one who realised that &apos;s a joke .
you had to grow up in our family .
that dig you made about me giving guys head under the boardwalk ?
he took it so seriously , bobby .
anyway ,
thank you for being here .
so what happens now ?
robert &apos;s already said he wants to go live with his aunt .
what about sophia ?
nica is my daughter .
she &apos;s very much into her older sister .
sophia &apos;s out of her mind if she thinks she &apos;s getting out of this house .
is that a joke ? cos that one even got by me .
you know , five , six years ago
when johnny sack bought this house ,
this was all cornfields here .
i &apos;d like to give it a shot with bobby &apos;s kids .
bobby would want it .
i put in a lot of effort with sophia , baking together .
i think we actually have a bond .
i had therapy . i &apos;m a good mother .
i put ma and all her warped shit behind me .
good .
not that i get any thanks for it .
you know , you could form a new nuclear family .
you bring harpo down here ...
it &apos;s a big place .
harpo changed his name .
he &apos;s hal now .
janice ...
you need anything , you know i &apos;m minutes away .
yeah .
multiple calls
traced back to a payphone in oyster bay , long lsland .
what ?
where &apos;s the phone at exactly ?
gas station , most likely .
gas station ?
he &apos;s lammed out .
he may not be able to get a clean cellphone .
listen , thanks . really ...
all right .
you kept telling me this guy is good .
it &apos;s amazing it was written so long ago .
it &apos;s , like , about right now .
this could be a mistake .
i know .
we &apos;re good friends .
yeah .
wait .
holy shit .
oh , my god .
go !
oh , christ . i parked in leaves .
at least my gas tank was practically empty .
how many fucking times have i told you ?
it &apos;s an suv ! watch where you park off road !
the catalytic converter and the dry vegetation .
i didn &apos;t see the leaves .
you can grill steaks on that converter .
i told you .
if there was children playing in those leaves ,
you &apos;d have run them over ?
i guess .
you gonna get cute now ?
i was just answering her question .
dad , he wasn &apos;t being funny .
you mind your own goddamn business unless you want some of this too .
mr fat mouth .
what did you say ?
what was going through your mind ?
what do you want from me ? i am depressed .
i &apos;m supposed to go round looking for piles of leaves ?
wanna hear depressed ? $ 30,000 for that car .
isn &apos;t that what you have insurance for ?
excuse me ? you &apos;re not getting another one .
actually , that &apos;s good .
lt &apos;ll force me to take the bus .
what ?
we have to break our dependence on foreign oil .
caf ? napoli .
george , it &apos;s anthony .
your fucking ears must be ringing .
i just left your friend , the son , crying the blues
over the situation between you and that outfit .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling .
i need you to reach out to the little guy .
he &apos;s not happy with phil neither .
i know .
you &apos;re not part of that family .
you &apos;re basically retired . everybody trusts you .
what i &apos;m thinking , you &apos;d supply a neutral location ,
guarantee everybody &apos;s safety .
i could do that .
hi , george .
hey .
they &apos;re here . they &apos;ve been patted down too .
anybody want a water ?
no .
no .
we started it ? we got a dead goomah in queens
and her old ukrainian father .
i &apos;m not even gonna blame phil .
john sacrimoni , my friend ,
i &apos;m sorry to say , was an insecure guy .
he created a constant tension
within his own family which spilled over .
go ahead , carmine .
george was good enough to broker this meeting . you just gonna sit there ?
it didn &apos;t have to be this way .
we agree . it &apos;s gone too far .
phil , i don &apos;t know ... he &apos;s changed .
you got my word . we &apos;ll back off .
my price is you help us get a location on phil .
i can &apos;t go there .
but you do what you gotta do .
one more thing . you hit my brother @-@ in @-@ law .
so ?
this is my sister we &apos;re talking about .
she &apos;s gotta see something out of this .
we &apos;ll come up with a number .
look at all this mail .
anybody need some barbers &apos; scissors ?
tone ?
put some next to my coat .
he was at the safe house . we brought him over .
get him the fuck out .
these are snakes with fur .
the old ltalians will tell you
you can &apos;t even put them around a baby .
they suck the breath right out .
you &apos;re the only baby here so we &apos;re ahead of the game .
you wanna be wearing his pelt on your head ?
i said get rid of him .
leave him .
he &apos;s a good guy .
no payphone .
look , there &apos;s a double @-@ breasted robin .
it doesn &apos;t cost anything to be polite .
that goes two ways , ma &apos;am .
pat , how are you ?
hi .
livia .
i &apos;m janice , her daughter .
what did he say ? i can &apos;t ...
uncle jun &apos; ,
i wanna show you something .
bobby and my baby .
janice .
no , i &apos;m janice .
that &apos;s my little girl . her name &apos;s domenica .
sweet as she looks , she left my stove on on purpose ,
put the flame out with a wet dishrag .
i caught her .
uncle jun &apos; ,
i &apos;m afraid i have bad news .
bobby &apos;s dead .
the ambassador hotel .
your bobby . bobby baccalieri .
i &apos;m a widow now .
she was inveigling him .
she &apos;s after his money .
you &apos;re not even curious about him ?
he can fucking rot .
when you were an inpatient
you said you might try and get a job .
i can &apos;t now because of the car .
i need to get a bus schedule .
the thing is ,
ever since it blew up
i feel , like ...
cleansed or something .
because
it was a polluter ?
no .
i mean , just watching it go ,
that huge fireball ...
you have no idea . the heat ...
my seat melted .
i had been in it just a few seconds before .
carlo .
yeah .
t , i had a meeting down here with carlo this morning .
we were supposed to go see butch and them on a couple of items .
carlo didn &apos;t show .
and he don &apos;t answer his phones neither .
i &apos;ll call you back on the prepay .
yeah .
what are you thinking ?
that maybe we were had .
that this butch has taken out another ranking guy .
t ?
what if he flipped ?
who ? carlo ?
well ?
you there ?
his kid , the imbecile ...
jason . he got picked up yesterday ,
patsy told me , for selling ecstasy .
mead &apos; , they &apos;re gonna be here ...
miss hunter ! long time no see .
how are you , mrs soprano ?
oh , my god , when was it ?
it was around when you quit college .
you &apos;re being kind . i was kicked out for partying and drunk driving .
well , i didn &apos;t want to say , but ...
well , that was always you .
what are you up to now ?
i &apos;m in my second year of med school .
yeah ,
i completed undergrad at purchase ,
got my act together .
yes . they &apos;re gonna be here , meadow .
a man took his horse to a vet
and the vet says to him , &quot; why do you have a long face ? &quot;
a horse goes . there &apos;s no man .
right . a horse goes to a vet .
the vet looks at his face and he says to him ,
&quot; my friend ...
a horse goes to the doctor .
the doctor says , &quot; why the long face ? &quot;
can &apos;t tell jokes .
more pinot grig &apos; , patrick ?
no , thanks .
speaking of jokers , where &apos;s that other son of yours today ?
i didn &apos;t think he was invited .
i just thought with all the wedding talk ...
no , really , that pal of his , the other jason ,
i heard he ran into some trouble .
carlo &apos;s jason .
he &apos;s a mess .
all right .
he &apos;s got no shortage of lawyers here .
tone , patsy needs a refill .
no , tone , i &apos;ll ...
sit down .
this one here would only take the case for free .
that &apos;s why we want her at grubman ,
grubman &amp; curcio .
mead &apos; and i have had some conversations
and we may still snag her at the firm
when she &apos;s done with law school .
no kidding ?
we went out to dinner with steven grubman and the subject came up .
steven was impressed with her work at the poverty law centre .
he even got into starting salaries . he was talking 1.70 .
jesus . sweetheart , that &apos;s fantastic .
he had had too much gevrey .
don &apos;t devalue yourself .
we &apos;ve got a real interesting case right now .
we &apos;re defending james trefoglio
on those corruption charges .
is that your case , honey ?
bid rigging . it &apos;s got bagmen , whores ,
it &apos;s fascinating .
yeah , he does that ,
sometimes most of the day , stares at chrissy &apos;s picture .
the fuck ?
you know , they &apos;re funny that way .
i had an aunt , her cat would only sit
at the exact corners of the table , staring out ,
or at the intersection of two walls , staring in .
this fucking animal is history today .
pick him up .
you pick him up .
t , you see this shit ?
does it all the time , he says .
yeah ?
look at him staring at that dead kid .
gives me the fucking creeps .
walden , give us some privacy .
yeah .
walden . what the fuck kind of name is that for an ltalian ?
i was named after mr bobby darin , walden robert cassotto .
the cifaretto crew , it &apos;s a fucking chinese fire drill over there ,
especially now carlo is absent .
i know .
i want you to skipper that thing .
really ?
fucking thing is one big atm machine .
all our construction with new york folds right into your kick .
yeah .
jesus , i thought you &apos;d be pleased .
i didn &apos;t hand you a diagnosis of the clap .
with due respect , i &apos;d like to just mull it a little .
i &apos;m no spring chicken no more .
i don &apos;t want to die on you , leaving you worse off than before .
you with the dead thing .
you got the arms and upper body of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
i gotta work at that .
and i had the prostate .
all right , sure .
go ahead .
i &apos;m a little miffled but yeah , sit with it .
thanks , t. this means everything ,
your faith in me .
in the line of duty .
but we &apos;re short @-@ handed .
anyway , mid- &apos; 60s , probably used the payphones .
we don &apos;t have payphones .
just a couple of stations have them now .
get in .
activity , that &apos;s good .
i can already see a difference .
yeah .
gotta get back at it myself .
listen .
i &apos;m gonna join the army .
what ?
did you sign any shit ?
no , but this week i will .
i gotta deal with rhiannon first .
rhiannon ? what about your mother ?
her too .
are you nuts ?
you wanna get sent to lraq ?
afghanistan .
it &apos;s probably good for my career .
you don &apos;t have a career .
my ultimate goal is
to qualify for helicopter pilot training ,
afterwards go to work for trump or somebody ,
be their personal pilot .
i &apos;m not even gonna tell your mother about this .
and don &apos;t you do nothing
until we &apos;ve had another chance to talk .
you hear me ?
yes .
he &apos;s gonna join the fucking army .
i gotta be frank ,
you people got him out of his room , great ,
so he can be cannon fodder ?
i wasn &apos;t aware of this latest plan .
sorry .
i should have gone before we left the house .
still on the army thing .
on the other hand , i &apos;m thinking he could benefit
from the training , the discipline .
maybe the army &apos;d be great for him
if there wasn &apos;t a war going on .
i didn &apos;t tell you , he spent $ 200
on a set of cds that teach arabic .
jesus christ , come on . shish kebab , what else do you need to know ?
he used to just veg in front of that tv .
he says he wants to get past the hate ,
focus it only on the terrorists .
i really can &apos;t reveal much more .
right . even though we &apos;re paying .
this whole therapy thing , i gotta tell you ...
what ?
my mother was a borderline personality .
so what ?
i don &apos;t know if you knew that .
no .
i did not have a very happy childhood .
no ?
there was little love in the house .
he &apos;s mentioned your mother briefly .
a very difficult woman ,
undermining .
i tried to place her in a retirement community
for her own good .
she turned on me completely .
you see , i never could please my mother .
to what do i owe this chance to go sake bombing ?
we used to have dinner all the time .
you &apos;re gonna get married and my chances are flying by me .
so , your brother ,
our little soldier boy ,
what do you think is wrong with that googootz ?
the world is a sad , fucked @-@ up place .
if there &apos;s so much suffering ,
why did you go off the paediatrician bit ?
we talked about that .
you said you wanted to be a lawyer for black people .
that &apos;s all i said ? really ?
what i said was the state can crush the individual .
new jersey ?
the government .
specifically the federal government .
and what about little babies
in the face of meningitis ?
you know what really turned me ?
seeing the way ltalians are treated .
it &apos;s like mom says . if we can have our rights trampled like that ,
imagine what it &apos;s like for recent arrivals .
if i hadn &apos;t seen you
dragged away all those times by the fbl
then i &apos;d probably be a boring suburban doctor .
bye @-@ bye .
wave bye @-@ bye , grandpa .
bye @-@ bye , pop @-@ pop .
say bye @-@ bye .
i gotta make a phone call .
i &apos;ll meet you at the drugstore .
tell the goddamn pharmacist to call dr laconis .
i should get a 60 @-@ day supply of the plavix .
phil !
oh , my god !
phil !
oh , my god !
help me ! oh ,
my god !
my babies ! somebody help !
help me ! the babies !
somebody help me .
help me , please .
oh , god , they &apos;re locked in there .
oh , shit !
seen metro news ?
no .
your own beat . phil leotardo got popped .
damn . we &apos;re gonna win this thing .
ok ,
as your parents we don &apos;t feel
joining the army is in your best interest .
this country is in a crisis .
how can one soldier stop it ?
when my enlistment &apos;s up ,
i could join the cla or something .
with a military background i &apos;d have a leg @-@ up .
as an arabic speaker i &apos;d be really useful .
you &apos;re gonna ask the donald
for some time off from your pilot job to go on cla missions ?
everything &apos;s a joke to you .
i &apos;m not having a good time .
did you or did you not want me to go to military school ?
but i started to cry .
at least you &apos;d have come out an officer .
even then i was opposed to it .
i hate this idea .
i &apos;m applying for officer candidate school .
i want to be a liaison officer
with the local population anyway .
officer candidate school ?
you have terrible grades . you flunked out of college .
here we go . that &apos;s all this is about , right ?
no , that &apos;s not what this is all about .
you don &apos;t want to go to college , don &apos;t go ,
but don &apos;t get your legs blown off .
always with the drama .
so what does your girlfriend say , the fashion model ?
she doesn &apos;t think i should go either .
well ?
not that long ago you talked about owning a club .
you had a problem with that too .
a lot of your friends are in film school , you say ,
especially the ones you used to go to the clubs with .
so i got this screenplay from danny baldwin .
we met at your cousin &apos;s movie .
danny hoped i &apos;d set him up with some financing ,
but i never read it .
well , you did now .
yeah , i did now
and it &apos;s about a private detective
that gets sucked into the internet through his data port .
and he &apos;s gotta solve
some murders and some virtual prostitutes .
i read it . it &apos;s scary .
i talked to little carmine
and he wants to develop it through his company .
he does porn .
he did cleaver . he &apos;s branching out .
you would work for his producer , lnge .
you would be , what is the word ?
development executive on this project .
really ?
what &apos;s this got to do with clubs ?
hollywood and gossip columns , the nightspots ...
you get some real @-@ world experience under your belt ,
you come see me
and we will talk about me investing in a club .
run that past rahoony , see what she says .
somebody &apos;s giving grand jury testimony on something .
so carlo has flipped .
we don &apos;t know .
and subpoenas are flying .
my hunch ...
80 to 90 % chance you &apos;ll be indicted .
that fucking gun charge ,
i get sick when i think of it ,
plus interstate fraud and , if carlo starts talking , homicide ...
give me the fucking thing .
not like we haven &apos;t envisioned this day .
no , it &apos;s not .
look , trials are there to be won .
so ?
with all due respect , and i mean that from the bottom of my heart ,
i &apos;m gonna pass .
i don &apos;t fucking believe this .
why ?
every guy who ran that crew died prematurely .
come on .
i beat cancer once .
you &apos;ve no idea what that does to you .
i know , but jesus ...
richie aprile , ralphie mla , vito ,
and who knows what with carlo , gigi ...
gigi died taking a shit .
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not part of an overall pattern .
are you gonna deny yourself life @-@ changing money ,
a package to leave your niece who has ms ?
it &apos;s like your bullshit with the cat .
the fucking animal catches mice for us
but you &apos;d drown it .
i would .
he &apos;s not looking at christopher .
a rat died in the wall back there or some shit .
i moved the picture . the fucking thing
came to the new spot and stared .
it &apos;s the abstract shapes or something .
tell you this ,
since he &apos;s dead ,
my gambling luck &apos;s done a 180 .
ok .
it &apos;s fine for you to believe that shit ,
but i can &apos;t worry about a jinx ?
tone , i never told this to another living soul , but ...
yeah ?
one time at the bing ,
i was alone to meet eddy lind ,
i saw the virgin mary .
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
fuck strippers , we could have had a shrine ,
sold holy water in gallon jugs .
could have made billions .
i tell you something deep in my heart and you laugh it off ?
i &apos;m not saying there &apos;s nothing out there ,
but to not live your life ? what the fuck are you gonna do ?
you don &apos;t want the job , you don &apos;t want the job .
i can put patsy in there .
he &apos;s gonna be part of my family now .
it &apos;ll be good .
prick .
you always know what to say to me , don &apos;t you ?
no , i &apos;m serious .
i live but to serve you , my liege .
well , they had to get it for me .
there &apos;s no real public transport out here .
but i said no more suv .
well , that &apos;s the cool part ,
23 highway . it &apos;s not so bad .
hey .
listen , we &apos;re not eating at home tonight .
i thought we &apos;d go to holsten &apos;s .
you said we &apos;d have manigott &apos; .
i got meetings with carpenters .
holsten &apos;s is the consensus .
i gotta see some people . i &apos;ll meet you there .
sir .
sir , excuse me .
hello .
what , you don &apos;t recognise me ?
we used to play catch .
you don &apos;t remember that you shot me ?
enough with the fucking birds .
i &apos;m anthony , johnny &apos;s son .
fuck you want , a boutonniere ?
all right , listen to me . uncle pat came to see me
about janice , about your money .
people keep asking me . i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a man from another galaxy that came here .
that &apos;s your accountant .
i &apos;m confused .
any money should go to bobby baccala &apos;s kids .
now , janice may not do that , but bobby was with us .
