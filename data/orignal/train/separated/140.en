第七季 第二十集
And what do you want?
You.
You're not getting divorced because of me?
No.
No.
Because...
That would be a bad idea.
Why?
Because I don't know what we are yet.
Well, I don't either,
but I'm through delaying anything.
I've looked back at my life, and every time
I didn't say something I meant
or waited for a better moment...
I-I should go anyway.
No, you're staying.
And they can just wait until I'm done.
There is no better moment.
That's the one thing-- the only thing I've discovered.
Everything comes to an end.
There's no better moment than now.
Mom, I need your help with the flowers.
Alicia, we will talk.
Okay.
What's that?
It's just a-- it's a little present.
Really, it...
it's nothing.
No, no, it...
I'm sorry, it...
...really is nothing.
It's a deed to some land on Mars.
They're selling it online,
so you own 500 acres in the Valles Marineris.
Seriously, Mom, I can't get them all in.
It was meant to be a joke.
I'm sorry. Here.
Mom!
I will call you.
Wow, that is a lot of flowers.
Hey, Jason. Hi.
Do you want me to help you bring these in?
Oh, no, thanks, I think we're sending them back.
Mom, the florist sent us funeral flowers.
They got our order mixed up with somebody else.
Okay, uh...
Good luck. Have a great party.
Thanks, bye.
Mom, they said that they knocked, but nobody answered,
so they just left them here.
I think they knew they were the wrong ones.
Mom?
Oh, my gosh, those are funeral flowers.
What are we gonna do?
I told them that it was for Grandma and Howard's...
What's it called?
A ketubah signing.
It's like a wedding contract.
Right, I think I called it a wedding reception.
Well, we have an hour.
I have to get myself changed, get the food out, decorate.
Let's get these inside and then you call the florist.
You don't think we could pass them off as celebratory, can we?
Like white for spring?
It would be funny if we try.
I don't think funny's what we're going for.
Exactly the man I wanted to see.
I thought I was meeting with Mike.
You were. Things have changed.
Ignore me, this is Dad's thing.
Yeah, put your earbuds in.
‭This is going to trial.
I know.
The governor doesn't want you to work on his case.
And part of our strategy is built on a speedy trial.
Uh, Peter needs to get back to work
and he can't do that with this...
Cloud?
Yes, yes, with this cloud hanging over him, so...
I need your help.
You know I'm not the best person to do this.
Yes, I do,
and that is why I need you.
I want you to prove that Peter is guilty.
Why?
We're being offered a plea bargain by the AUSA.
It makes no sense.
Three years in prison?
The evidence doesn't support it.
Get the discovery.
I did, and I'm not getting a straight answer
from Peter's investigators--
They're being far too deferential--
so I need you to be tough.
Show me why he's guilty.
Hey, food's here. What's that?
Uh, nothing.
Any luck with the flowers?
No, they said that it's our fault.
That we've ordered the bereavement array.
I said that there's a funeral somewhere that's getting flowers
that say, "Congratulations, Howard and Jackie."
You look really pretty.
Why, thank you. So do you.
Thank you.
Let me see that. What is it?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's a deed to land on Mars.
Why do you have a deed to land on Mars?
I have no idea.
It was a gift.
What, from a 13-year-old?
Or 12. Maybe he was 12 years old.
"The Florrick Homestead."
Pretty weird gift, isn't it?
Yeah, who gave it to you?
Someone from work.
I mean, 500 acres.
That's a lot of acres.
You're right.
It could've been 50 acres.
You could ranch there.
I could raise a family.
Hello? Mom?
Aw. Thank you.
For what?
For coming home for this.
And for wearing a tie.
It was a long weekend.
How's grandma doing?
She's happy.
Good.
Grace.
We have funeral flowers.
We do. Why?
Well, we thought we'd go a different way.
Okay, the guests are coming in ten minutes.
Let's try and pull this together.
So, I have a surprise for you, Mom.
Oh, is it a deed to land on Mars?
What?
Nothing. Your sister's in a funny mood.
What's the surprise?
I can't tell you yet.
You're flunking out.
No.
You were snoring.
Do we have a meeting?
‭Nope. Just dropped by.
Here.
It's a donut.
I have another five hours of work tonight, Jason.
Whatever you want,
can we do this another time?
Governor Florrick.
You?
They must be paying you well.
Did he do it?
You mean did he tank my prosecution
in order to satisfy one of his donors?
Sure, let's start with that. You tell me.
I had a strong case.
Richard Locke shoots his girlfriend Patty
when she comes home one night.
Two bullets in the chest.
Look at the crime scene photos.
Poor woman bled out.
How was the scene?
Untouched.
Locke said he didn't do it,
but he was covered in blood.
Who ran the case?
A detective from the 32nd.
Uh... Crowell.
Rick Crowell?
I know him.
Yeah, he's not a cowboy.
So it was a slam-dunk case.
Till Peter got involved.
See, he was the new state's attorney.
Came in and started micromanaging
right from the start.
"Are you sure about the witnesses?"
"Was he properly Mirandized?"
"What about the blood?" "Are you sure?"
And were you sure?
This shouldn't have been a mistrial.
Richard Locke should be in prison right now.
It was premeditated.
But you know what he is doing right now?
He got married a month ago.
Tough thing being rich.
Yup, I'm sure he's all broken up on the inside.
Thanks.
Go back to sleep.
Promise me one thing.
What?
Don't get the governor off.
Grace, that's the florist.
Can you get that?
We're here.
Grace, my dear.
Grandma's here ten minutes early!
Well, traffic was so good.
And you never can tell if it's going to rain.
Can I get a hit of that?
How are you, Mom?
I'm hunky-dory.
You seem frazzled.
Thanks. It's a good thing.
It's more real.
Okay. To real.
Just want to check my makeup.
Grandma, they made a mistake. Don't worry.
Oh, my God, they are just beautiful.
You like them?
Why are we hiding them in the bedroom?
Sorry we're early, the traffic was light.
Oh, you must be Zach.
Mom?
Grandma likes the flowers.
She's pulling them out into the living room.
I thought we had another ten minutes.
Oh, hello.
You're Grace, right?
I'm Hannah McCreary.
Is your brother...?
Mom, I want you to meet my girlfriend, Hannah.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I loved that you stood by your husband.
A lot of people my age think it's a throwback
to an old kind of domesticity,
but I think it's a harbinger of a new feminism.
Like Huma Abedin, you know?
Women should do what they want,
even if what they want is to stand by their man.
Hannah's a proctor in my dorm.
Really?
I know I'm older,
but Zach is older in maturity than he looks.
And sometimes compatibility is more a function
of intellectual reach than physical years, don't you think?
You look relaxed.
Upside of choosing unemployment.
What do you need?
Do you know Jason Crouse?
I do. My old work.
He dropped by.
That's why I called.
He's investigating for Peter Florrick,
the Richard Locke mistrial.
Makes sense.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
That's what he said?
No, that's what I know.
They're looking for someone to point a finger at.
Well, it's not me.
Are you sure?
We were the prosecutors.
We dealt with the evidence.
We didn't tank it.
Yeah, in my experience,
whenever there's a battle between truth and power,
truth loses.
So, how long have they been dating?
I don't know.
I didn't even know that they were dating; she's like 23.
Alicia, what are you doing in the kitchen?
Get some catering help.
Mom?
What are you doing here?
Jackie invited me.
And I drove her. Mom can't drive anymore.
No, I chose not to.
Where's the wine?
Wait, Jackie invited you?
Why? You guys hate each other.
Oh, Alicia, sometimes you're so innocent about women.
Pour one for me, too.
She invited me
so she could lord it over me about her new husband.
I mean, this is how sick in the head your mother-in-law is.
She actually thought I'd be jealous of Howard.
Hey, darling. Ooh.
So, I heard you got into college.
Yeah.
Who's gonna be the smart one now, huh?
And, Alicia, empty nest--
that is coming up quickly for you, isn't it?
Alicia, do you think you have enough wine?
Have you seen them out there?
They're all senior citizens.
We're gonna be the only ones drinking.
No, Zach drinks, too, now.
What? Zach? How old is Zach?
I thought he was just out of high school.
That's okay, children should learn to drink young.
Italian kids drink right out of the crib, look at them.
Sis, is there anything I should know?
Hey, thanks for doing this for Mom.
Can we talk for a minute?
Sure.
Eli, how are you?
Marissa, you look beautiful.
Thank you. I'm Dad's plus-one.
Thought I'd class him up.
There was a misunderstanding.
So I talked to Chris Broccoli,
and he had a suggestion.
Neil?
Yeah, the divorce lawyer.
He suggested we do a one-lawyer divorce
since it's amicable.
We don't have to use him if you want to agree on someone else.
One-one-one minute. Thank you.
What do you think?
I think that's... smart.
Good.
Because I don't want to fight with you.
I know.
I don't want to either.
So Zach brought a girlfriend here.
Hannah.
Really?
She's 23 years old, she graduates this year.
Should we be worried?
Oh, I don't know.
It's a college romance, they don't last long.
We were a college romance.
And look at us.
One second.
Could you give us a moment?
So...
we're divorcing, then?
We are.
Do you feel sad?
I do.
I guess it's just...
...that's what happens.
Yeah.
Mom, I think you'd better get out here!
What?
L'chaim!
To another marriage in the family.
Congrats to Zach and Hannah.
Alicia, why is he getting married?
I don't know, Mom,
why don't you ask him?
He'd just say "Love."
You were like that when you were in college.
Have you talked to her, the girlfriend?
Not much.
Grace says she's 23. He's 19.
Yes, and Dad was eight years older than you.
No, he wasn't.
Besides, it was
a totally different thing-- he was a man.
Oh, my God.
Where are you going?
To talk to my son.
Hi, Kurt, Diane, thank you for coming.
Hi, it's so nice of you to do this.
Well, Howard is family now.
He is.
Can we talk later?
Sure.
You're in an odd mood.
He's dropping out of school.
Not forever, all right?
I'll probably go back in a year or two.
You know it cost us $60,000
to put you in that school?
And you'll save that money next year.
Why? Why are you dropping out, Zach?
Hannah got a job in France.
A good job as a translator.
He's moving to France.
And what are you going to do in France?
I don't know, I've been thinking about writing.
Zach.
Zach, come on. Look at your mom.
It's insane.
I mean, who's gonna pay for this?
Hannah, she has a good job.
You're gonna let her pay for you?
Why not? We're not as held up on the gender thing.
Alicia?
Yeah?
Do you want to join us?
Sorry.
Zach, face it.
This is the stupidest thing
I've heard you say in a while.
Thanks, Mom.
And there have been some pretty stupid things.
All right, let's not go...
You're gonna move to France with Hannah
so you can be a househusband and write what?
What are you gonna write, Zach?
A memoir.
I'm in a memoir class.
Okay, you know what?
I love her, all right?
And I'm getting married and we're moving to France.
All right, wait a minute.
Zach, we're your parents and we love you,
but we want you to think about this.
Well, we have one kid left.
I guess we shouldn't laugh at him.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I think you have to handle this; I've been drinking.
You're a good dad, you know?
Are you being funny?
No, you are.
Yeah, and look how well it turned out.
Okay.
I'll talk to Zach.
Oh, and say what?
"Je ne sais pas"?
Go ahead, take it.
No.
That's okay.
I'm away from my phone at the moment,
so please leave a message.
‭Hey, Alicia, it's me, I...
I've called you a couple times.
I know you're partying it up,
but could you call me, please?
Um... So...
Jason Crouse.
Detective Rick Crowell.
How's it going?
Overworked and underpaid.
I know the feeling.
So you were the first responder
at the Richard Locke crime scene.
I was.
Bad case.
Did you think that Peter Florrick micromanaged it?
No.
Best state's attorney we've had in 20 years
and a hell of a governor.
And that has nothing to do with the fact
that you work private security for his campaign?
No.
Best state's attorney we've had in 20 years
and a hell of a governor.
Okay.
And, yes, it was odd he came to the crime scene,
but I read nothing into that.
It's probably just irrelevant
that he wanted to double-check all the blood collection.
Thanks, Rick.
I need a lawyer.
You had a whole suite of them. Why me?
I don't work there anymore.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm not.
And now you want to sue.
No, this is about the governor.
Let's talk.
I'm so glad that you find my life funny, Mom.
I'm not laughing now, Zach.
I'm asking a favor.
I'm in love, Mom.
You should be talking to Hannah right now, not me.
Try to figure out why I'm in love with her.
I see you and Dad rolling your eyes about her,
she's not up to your standards, she...
Zach, let's make this simple, okay?
Your dad is on trial.
Mom, don't guilt me with that.
Zach, he's in trouble.
He could go to prison for three years.
Just...
don't move to France until it's over.
That's all I ask, okay?
It's what you do for family.
This lab took a lot of flack over the Richard Locke case.
Cost me a promotion.
I understand, ma'am.
The blood spatter found at the crime scene,
it was...
Processed correctly.
As was all the evidence, by me personally.
Then I don't understand the problem.
There is no problem.
He just told me not to use it, that's all.
Florrick?
Yes, Florrick, the governor.
Look, you want to spin this
to make it look like we screwed up,
but he's the one who insisted
that the blood evidence was mishandled.
That would've put Locke away for 30 years,
but Florrick vetoed it.
Why?
I don't know. Ask him.
But first...
I'd check the evidence log.
Something's missing.
Nice party.
So...
Jason called.
He said you weren't returning his calls.
I'm throwing a party.
He thought it was more than that.
I told him I wanted to be with him.
All the time.
Okay.
What did he say?
He gave me a deed to Mars.
I don't understand, is that a metaphor?
He gave me a gift of a deed he bought online.
A deed to 500 acres... on Mars.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore
or why I thought that I loved him.
It was a joke.
I'm sure it was a joke.
I-I don't know who he is.
Uh, I-I don't know anything about him.
Then find out about him.
I think you're in his head.
He didn't sound like himself.
At least return his calls.
Yeah, your mother wanted to drop out of college.
She wanted to go to India for a year.
Seriously?
Ah, well, it was a different time.
No, she didn't.
Mom, you're making that up.
I'm not making it up.
You're not privy to every conversation
between mother and daughter, you know.
Oh, there you are, Veronica.
How are you?
I'm good.
Drinking, I see.
Yes.
It's the one way I have of dealing with that jealousy
over you having a husband, while I have none.
Mom...
Oh, it's okay, Owen.
Some people deal with loneliness in different ways.
Yes, that's me.
Lonely.
And worrying about Peter and Alicia getting a divorce.
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't know?
Yes, your son and my daughter are getting a divorce.
They are not.
Oh, yes, they are.
David Lee told me, he's very upset that they didn't hire him.
Mom, maybe now's not the right time.
Grace, no, I-I could be wrong.
You never know.
What does David Lee say about this? He can't agree to it.
He makes the same money.
And it's branding.
He understands branding.
An all-female partnership?
Yes, congratulations.
Congratulations.
You're getting a divorce?
Grandma says you're getting a divorce.
She heard it from David Lee.
Would you excuse me, Diane?
Can we just talk here?
Why is everything always secrets in this family?
Zach, please.
Eli.
Where's Peter?
I don't know.
I'm thinking of going to law school, what do you think?
Great. Can-can we talk later?
It says "well-regulated militia."
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.
Oh, actually, I'd like to talk to Zach and Grace alone.
No, anything you say to me, you can say to her.
No, thank you, though.
How long ago did you decide?
A month ago.
And you're just now telling us?
We weren't telling anyone.
We're not "anyone," Mom.
You're right. I'm sorry.
We just wanted to get through Dad's trial.
Is this about Jason?
Wait, who's Jason?
Her investigator.
You have an investigator?
Well, her firm does.
So, this is about him?
It isn't.
But?
But what?
It just sounded like you're going to say something else.
No, just...
You're sleeping with him.
That is none of your business.
Just like Hannah's none of your business.
That's different.
How is it different?
We think you're making a mistake.
You mean as opposed to you sleeping with your investigator?
Okay, this has nothing to do with you.
I'm the parent here.
Okay, you know what the difference is?
I'm getting married and you're getting divorced,
and I'm the one who's making the mistake?
Mom?
Actually, I didn't know that you would be out here.
I'm here for Eli, he asked me not to call.
Oh, uh, I'll go get him.
Wait.
I want to talk to you, too.
I-I called you earlier.
Yes, we'll talk.
I'll...
I'll get Eli.
First the groom signs the ketubah.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
And the bride.
And the two witnesses.
Mr. Gold.
And Ms. Gold.
My two Jewish friends.
How nice.
Thank you, thank you.
Bravo.
That was fast.
It wasn't hard; nobody's hiding anything.
That doesn't sound good.
Peter micromanaged the case.
He went to the crime scene.
He did? Why?
Nobody knew.
He questioned all the evidence,
he even vetoed some.
Maybe it was bad evidence.
It was blood spatter from the apartment.
It showed that Locke's story was a lie.
Peter told the lab tech not to use it.
There's more.
The bullets that killed Locke's girlfriend?
They went missing from the crime lab.
Peter was the last person to sign in.
Okay, let me talk to him.
Stay on it.
Eli?
Could you...
could you get Alicia for me?
I need to tell her something.
She's hosting.
I know, it'll just take a second.
This thing says I'm supposed to give the bride
a couple of pieces of silver,
just don't count on it.
Hello.
Mr. Canning, what do you want?
To play on the same team.
You know how we always do better when we fight the same fights.
And what fight are we talking about?
Well, I'm representing cary Agos in the Peter Florrick case,
and I understand you represent Eli Gold.
And, um, you want to join forces?
The more Peter's old allies appear in lockstep against him,
the more it keeps a spotlight on him.
It deflects culpability from our guys.
I call it "The coalition of the innocent."
This isn't a good idea.
Okay.
Then let's go.
I can't.
I just want to talk.
Tomorrow.
No.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't handle that well earlier,
and then I came back here and it was awkward,
and I know that if you have two awkward moments in a row,
that it can be trouble clawing it back.
What are we clawing back?
That thing that I gave you...
The Mars property?
Yeah.
See, I didn't know that I was coming here
and we were gonna have a serious conversation.
It was...
it was in my pocket, and it was just supposed to be this...
this fun thing.
I like space, I like stuff about space.
I get it.
I'm fine.
I'd better get back.
No, please wait.
I don't like spending more than a year in any one place,
I like to be able to drop everything at a moment's notice
and just go.
Then go, no one's stopping you.
You are.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
I think we need to clarify what we're saying here.
I want you, too.
You do?
I do,
but I am trying to explain to you that I can't be...
stuck.
And I would make you feel stuck?
No.
No, you just have this whole life here.
You have beautiful kids, a beautiful place,
and a business.
And you want me to give that up?
No.
No, I am just... I'm bringing up a problem.
I'm not saying that there's a solution.
Okay.
I'm gonna repeat to you what I think I heard.
You want to go somewhere else and you want me to go with you,
but not now, but at some point
when you get itchy about staying in one place?
Okay, I...
I need to think on this.
So, do you know anyone here?
A few.
So why law school?
I thought you'd be happy.
I don't know.
Feels like a trick.
The law is exciting.
Things move fast.
Uh, no, they don't.
Most of the law is just boring...
paperwork and meetings.
Hello?
How rude.
Answering your cell at a dinner party?
Oh, hi. Um, yeah, I'm standing right next to him. Why?
Who is it?
Mike Tascioni.
Tom is sick.
Why's he calling you?
And why's he calling you about his dog?
We've grown close.
He couldn't get a hold of you.
What number is he trying? = Shh!
Oh, no, that-that's terrible.
Uh... okay, hold on.
Tom had a nervous reaction to medication.
And he can't argue in court.
What?
Mike, what?
You can't just...
You're leaving us in the lurch?
I don't care how sick your dog...
He hung up on me.
Eli, can I borrow you?
I-I'm kind of in the middle of an emergency right now, Diane.
Listen, can Cary Agos hurt you
with this Richard Locke business?
I just lost Peter's trial lawyer.
I need your help.
See? Things do move fast.
Why did you veto the blood spatter?
What?
The blood spatter at the Richard Locke crime scene.
It pointed to his guilt and you told the lab tech not to use it.
Did you hire a new investigator?
Or is this from Jason Crouse?
Answer the question, Peter.
Why did you veto the blood spatter?
The blood spatter was compromised
by the lab tech who collected it.
I was there, I saw it.
So, all of a sudden you decide to show up at a crime scene?
What the hell were you thinking?
Listen, Eli, this case was going to be scrutinized.
It was going to be our O.J.,
so I went down there to get ahead of it.
Except this lab tech walked right through the blood.
So I vetoed it.
Because allowing it would've lost us the trial.
And the bullets?
You were the last person to sign for them.
Yeah, like I said, this blood spatter was a royal screwup.
So I went down to look into this lab tech,
and lo and behold,
she had a whole string of similar screwups
going back two years.
So I hired someone else to check the ballistics.
Who?
Kurt McVeigh.
God, I like watching you.
Eat.
Shoot.
Just stand.
Good thing I like being watched.
Let's go home.
Ten more minutes.
I don't want to be rude.
Uh, Jason, I need to talk to you.
It's important.
I did what I had to do.
I killed people that needed killing.
I know.
I know, not...
not you.
I'm sorry.
I told him to call ahead.
Excuse me?
I told Zach he should call ahead,
but he wanted to surprise you.
You hate me, don't you?
No.
We are in love.
I know.
We're just worried that things are moving too fast.
How long have you known each other?
A year.
Do you really think that's...
long enough to make the biggest commitment of your life?
How long did you know each other before you got married?
Three years.
And now you're divorcing.
Yes.
That's why I'm concerned.
I don't want Zach, or you,
to go through what I am.
But that's the thing,
we won't.
Well, you don't know that.
No, I mean we won't go through all the... mess.
It's just marriage.
My parents divorced,
but they still see each other, they still love each other.
But they see other people, too.
Marriage should work for us,
not us for marriage.
If Zach doesn't like France, he can leave me.
Come back home, go to school.
If he meets someone else he loves more, then...
why should I trap him?
Marriage should be fun, it shouldn't be this...
weight,
this death knell.
if it isn't permanent, then why get married at all?
Taxes.
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.
I have hurt so many people.
Peter can explain everything.
I'm sure he can.
He vetoed the blood splatter
because the lab tech botched the evidence collection.
Turns out she has a history of sloppy mistakes.
Why'd he sign in at the lab?
He was checking up on the tech.
And the missing bullets?
I'm sorry, but I have to ask, Jason,
are your feelings for Alicia getting in the way of this?
If you think so, feel free to fire me.
You know, you're right.
Thank you.
You can send me your bill.
You must have one hell of a union.
Excuse me?
Botched hair evidence in a 2011 rape trial,
misidentified bite marks in a 2010 aggravated assault,
and yet you still have a job.
What do you want, Mr. Crouse?
I didn't do my homework before,
but you have quite a history of sloppy mistakes
costing Peter Florrick convictions.
And you didn't tell me that you walked through the blood
at the Richard Locke crime scene.
There were at least a dozen cops in that apartment.
There was no room to maneuver,
but I didn't lose those bullets.
Did the AUSA interview you?
I'm not talking anymore.
Why are you setting Florrick up?
I'm not.
I'm telling you the truth.
No, you are lying.
And you say that up on the stand,
you will be charged with perjury.
Are you threatening me?
No.
I am just stating the facts, ma'am.
Next time you talk to the AUSA,
I'd share that little fact.
Mr. Canning.
Long time, no hear.
Yes.
I miss you, Alicia.
How's everything going for you?
Good, thank you.
And you?
Well, maybe you can help me.
I'm representing Cary Agos,
and I need to know if Peter's gonna be loyal
to his former deputy,
keep him out of this little legal mess or-or not.
I have no idea, but I will pass on the message.
Maybe I should be asking if he's gonna keep you out of it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've had a lot of interaction
with Lloyd Garber over the years.
You wrote him thank-you notes for fund-raisers.
Okay.
And?
You waived your spousal privilege
during the grand jury hearings,
and, uh, if the prosecutor asks you
to testify about Peter's relationship with Lloyd Garber,
he could easily turn it around on you.
Good-bye, Mr. Canning.
Which is why you need
to think about giving Peter up.
And there's the last joke.
Where are you, huh?
Where?
Okay, this is it. Good night.
I didn't get to talk to you all evening.
Tell me why I should be a lawyer in three words or less.
You're...
you're smart.
Okay, I'll take that.
We have to talk.
I know.
No, we really have to talk.
I know.
This is in case we die tomorrow.
Okay, let's not die tomorrow.
See you at work.
Firm of the Amazons.
I like that.
Thanks for everything.
You're welcome.
Maybe one day you can teach me how to be happy.
Not sure I can teach you anything.
I've been drinking.
I can see that.
Oh, you're such a good daughter.
I love you.
I love you, too.
And I'm glad you're leaving him
and going with the hunk.
Okay, Mom. Thanks.
I just want you to be happy.
Is that wrong?
Where's Owen?
Oh, I'm here.
Mm, I want you both to be happy.
You'll get her home safe?
Of course.
I love you.
I love you, too.
And I love you both.
It's the only good thing about me.
I love you both.
Alicia.
Thank you, it was beautiful.
Jackie, I'm glad you're happy.
But I won't be seeing you again.
Why not?
You're divorcing my son.
And I just wanted you to know,
we're more alike than not.
Good night and thank you.
This was, by far, the best ketubah signing
I've ever been to.
Good night, Howard.
Good night.
We're leaving, Mom.
I know.
Text me.
Be good, please.
I will.
I don't want to die!
God!
Mother!
No, you don't understand.
I'm sorry!
That's not a plea bargain.
No, look, even if I were guilty,
I'd fight that, okay?
Did I miss Zach?
Yeah, he left.
He said he'd call you tomorrow.
Is he going?
To France?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll talk to him.
No. Don't.
It's his mistake, let him make it.
I'm sorry.
You look exhausted.
I'll be out of your hair in a second.
Don't worry.
All I have is a kitchen full of dirty dishes.
What are we toasting to?
Our divorce.
Good-bye.
I'll miss you.
