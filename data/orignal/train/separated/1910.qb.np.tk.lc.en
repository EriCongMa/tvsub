&quot; map of you &quot;
researchers are currently working
to make a map of the human brain .
it may be the most complex map
ever created ...
good morning .
good morning .
billions of neurons making trillions of connections .
at first glance , they seem completely random .
careful . hot .
but there is nothing random about them .
all these connections have to happen
in a specific pattern .
it is designed for a function .
these connections determine everything about us ,
what we love ...
what we hate ...
what we say ...
what we do ...
every action we take .
open your hand , okay , mickey ?
like this ?
exactly . like that .
yeah , baby !
okay , now close it .
oh , yeah !
as he thinks about movements , we see brain activity
here and here . these areas lighting up .
now the brain @-@ computer interface is the key
to new possibilities , whether it be robotic prosthetics ...
for quadriplegics like mickey ...
or letting me kick ass at &quot; tetris &quot; again .
hey , check this out , you guys .
hang loose !
hey , where &apos;s dr. torres ?
how &apos;s she missing this ?
this is the best that we &apos;ve ever done .
shane , text her again , will you ?
is something wrong ?
there &apos;s not a lot of temporal lobe activity .
nothing lights up here .
is it a bad connection in the sensor ?
i hope so .
if not , it &apos;s a bad connection in his brain .
schedule mickey for an m.r.i.
i brought this from home accidentally .
can you just put it in with my diaper bag and stuff ?
and , uh , i &apos;ll try and find torres .
what &apos;s up , second year ?
this is a step up , right ?
are these assigned ?
yes . there &apos;s a lab coat with your name .
what are you so happy about ?
can &apos;t tell you .
you wish i could , but i can &apos;t .
so please don &apos;t ask .
why are there no doors on these ?
i know , right ?
like , &quot; hello , tampons . meet everyone . &quot;
you guys , there &apos;s a coat here for heather brooks .
oh , my god .
seriously ?
okay , is he being weird ?
did he fail the exam ?
he left right after . he didn &apos;t come celebrate .
also , he kissed me .
oh , yeah , he kissed her . it could be that .
i totally get it . i &apos;ve got a secret thing going , too .
there &apos;s no coffee here . this is bad .
i can &apos;t tell you who kissed me , though .
hey .
hey ! i woke up at your place ...
alone , again .
yeah , i was out late .
this has been three nights now .
yeah , i &apos;ve been , uh , going out . that--that &apos;s all .
i passed my intern exam . i never heard from you .
is there something going on ?
alex , talk to me .
alex ?
ugh . i thought she would never leave .
hmm ?
so you got my texts ?
i passed my intern exam .
yeah , yeah , i did . i @-@ i replied .
i @-@ i wrote &quot; congratulations . &quot;
i hoped i would see you .
i had such an amazing time the other night .
yeah , it was fun .
i feel like i &apos;m ready to ... take it further--
um , you know , um , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not a good idea ,
um ... at work ?
i totally get it .
see you tonight ?
mm @-@ hmm .
you paged me ?
dr. edwards , ben bosco ,
his wife joyce .
hi .
he &apos;s got an ankle fracture .
that moving walkway thing at the airport--
we were running to catch our connection to alaska--
ahh , to see the northern lights .
then he steps off that thing ,
and i heard it . i heard it just go
crack .
like the whole world slammed on the brakes ,
and i kept going .
and here we are .
he &apos;s gonna need a full workup and an ortho consult .
also get a chest x @-@ ray , &apos; cause it might be surgical .
keep me posted .
okay . i will get those x @-@ rays .
oh ! excuse me .
sorry . oh ! sorry .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s not weird ?
i called you .
robbins doesn &apos;t know that we &apos;re dating , does she ?
&apos;cause i just don &apos;t want to trade on our ...
whatever this is to , uh , get to observe a surgery .
no .
good . i just like to keep it professional , you know ?
at work .
yeah , of course .
um , hey , uh ...
are we not telling people ? &apos; cause i told a couple people .
yeah , you could .
uh , you should .
i would .
good . good .
well , we are at work . so ...
thanks for the call .
yeah .
oh . excuse me .
hi . hello .
bring your girlfriend to work day ?
robbins has a teratoma in a 3 @-@ month ,
and , uh , emma--
doctor , uh , marling--
is gonna observe .
that &apos;s sweet .
this isn &apos;t gonna be weird , is it ?
for me ? please .
will it be weird for her ?
i mean is she-- is she the type to get freaked out by the ex ?
damn it .
mer ...
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , nothing . i &apos;m--
i &apos;m just , uh , trying to decide on a research project .
decide between what ?
nothing . i got it .
this pain isn &apos;t going away .
it &apos;s a constant pain in my left shoulder .
and what do you think is causing that ?
were you injured in a fall ?
you tell me . you &apos;re my doctor .
right . sorry .
it &apos;s just that you &apos;re also my teacher .
excuse me , dr. bailey ...
do you remember reading somewhere
about unfinished research on iliac @-@ portal vein grafts ?
why ?
tonight is the deadline
to submit for the n.i.h. research grant i want .
and i &apos;m having trouble deciding
between ischemia--
ah , you &apos;re peeing on a tree .
yeah , first year attending scared of screwing up .
so , um , she takes the easy cases .
she keeps a low profile .
but second year attending has got to step it up--
take the flashy cases , publish the research ,
mark her territory . pee on some trees .
portal veins ... any bells ?
it was your mother &apos;s .
&quot; portal vein interposition with iliac vein graft . &quot;
ellis was working on it when she got sick .
it &apos;s in one of the journals you gave me .
oh , crap .
i have a mug like that .
if you don &apos;t come back with a solid diagnosis
for my shoulder pain ,
i &apos;m gonna kick you off my case .
as my teacher or my patient ?
get out .
i need a differential diagnosis for webber &apos;s shoulder pain .
arthritis , bursitis ...
any of the old people &quot; -itises . &quot;
still waiting on my broken ankle &apos;s chest scans .
you got coffee .
so alex isn &apos;t talking to me .
i think it &apos;s &apos; cause i pushed him to
talk to his deadbeat dad .
alex has a dad ?
have you talked to shane ?
i &apos;m still hoping it &apos;ll go away .
shane kissed me . i didn &apos;t kiss him .
it &apos;s his problem .
he has a huge tumor in his heart .
no ...
he has a broken ankle .
okay , yeah . thank you .
you okay ?
yeah , why ?
yeah , we tested the new sensors
with mickey wenschler this morning .
and--and it was a huge success .
but he kept asking why you weren &apos;t there .
uh , well , didn &apos;t you-- didn &apos;t you get my text ?
your text said , &quot; won &apos;t be there . &quot;
okay , well , uh , here &apos;s the thing--
moving back into my place made me feel like
i really need to move back into &quot; my place , &quot;
you know , concentrate on what makes me , me .
i do regenerative cartilage .
it &apos;s what my t.e.d. talk was about--
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m not going forward with the project .
you should totally run with it , though .
no , this is your project .
mickey &apos;s your patient . i can &apos;t do this .
i don &apos;t have time . meredith and i
are in over our heads with kids ,
and she needs time , too .
so maybe we just drop it .
no harm done , right ?
oh , and tell that to mickey wenschler .
mickey will be all right .
edwards , i just saw your broken ankle .
no surgery , just splint it .
he won &apos;t be all right . it &apos;s gonna kill him .
i know , right ?
i can &apos;t do this .
did you do this ?
uh , i ...
i need to find kepner .
no , who broke this ?
yeah , sorry . i dropped it .
dr. yang , uh , would you look at this ?
holy--wow !
i mean , it &apos;s bad , right ?
look , this wasn &apos;t yours to use--
shane , not now !
this is a rat &apos;s nest of an a.v.m. in the left ventricle .
it &apos;s probably pushing in on the valve .
if it &apos;s not treated , he &apos;ll be dead in months .
he came in for a broken ankle .
and now i have to tell them he &apos;s dying .
okay , let me look at the blood work ,
and we &apos;ll tell them together .
god , thank you so much .
this place is a maze .
that &apos;s dr. robbins ?
yeah .
and you are ?
dr. robbins , emma marling .
oh , right .
right , right , you &apos;re observing .
and i &apos;m scrubbing in ...
i hope .
murphy , i &apos;m sorry . with dr. marling ,
i think the table &apos;s full . um , next time ?
okay , so we just gave little erin &apos;s parents the pre @-@ game ,
and we &apos;re about to take her up .
murphy , will you show her where to get some scrubs ?
visiting surgeon ?
yeah , maternal / fetal . she &apos;s researching
minimally invasive in @-@ utero teratomas .
and she &apos;s hot . i &apos;m just saying
it &apos;s good that i &apos;ll be there to chaperone .
what , we &apos;re not joking about this yet ?
see you in there .
here .
this is my mother &apos;s journal . where did you get this ?
webber ... made me go to his house .
and i need to figure out why his shoulder hurts .
can i go ?
yeah .
what was that about ?
research funding .
i &apos;m trying to decide between an ischemia study
and this portal vein thing that my mother was working on .
ooh ! do that .
it &apos;s half @-@ baked .
a @-@ and i don &apos;t like trading on my mother &apos;s name .
no , it &apos;s your story .
&quot; brilliant young surgeon finishes work
of dead brilliant mother surgeon &quot; --
it writes itself . invest in your brand .
you make me sound like a soft drink .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
yeah , i &apos;m reinvesting in myself .
that &apos;s the perfect reason ...
right ?
not to .
shane , here you go . some good stuff in there .
enjoy .
ugh . you don &apos;t get it .
these are mickey &apos;s m.r.i.s ?
dr. shepherd ... i wondered if you &apos;d mind
if i switch services after today .
i asked for you specifically .
i know .
look , what happened last year between you and brooks ,
i think i may have been unfair ,
and i was hoping for a chance to make it right .
so ... now that brooks is gone ...
i get to take her place ?
oh , hell .
well , that &apos;s why the sensors weren &apos;t lighting .
he has a glioma .
can you treat it ?
i could try hitting it with some glue .
glue ?
embolization glue . we use it for a.v.m.s.
we pump superglue into the vessels ,
the glue hardens , cuts off blood to the tumor .
i could try it . mm ...
no . it goes all the way to the brain stem .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
and going in surgically ?
it &apos;s the same thing .
i &apos;m afraid of doing more harm than good .
it &apos;s a very deadly mass .
it &apos;s a large veinous malformation ...
and without intervention immediately ,
i &apos;m afraid the prognosis is very bad .
yeah , that &apos;s the thing .
um , i have been dying of that for years .
you knew about this and you didn &apos;t mention it ?
i &apos;m sorry . - in your medical history , there &apos;s --
i was so hung up on missing our plane --
it &apos;s an inoperable a.v.m.
he was diagnosed with it , what , a y --
year and a half -- - year before last , yeah .
january .
and terminal .
so ... what are you gonna do ?
so we just quit our jobs , cashed out all our accounts ,
and just started traveling . - yeah , just doing stuff --
trips , activities , basically cramming as much living
as we could into the time we have left .
okay , did your doctor -- did he or -- or --
or she , uh , try treating it with radiation ?
yeah , tried that .
intravenous coiling ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah , no dice .
and the sclerosing agents --
uh , what about a transplant ? or what about ...
there are a lot of --
sweetie ...
i know it &apos;s hard .
it was hard for us , too .
but you have to let it go .
because there is nothing i can do about it .
i &apos;m sorry . the best course
is to leave it alone and hope for the best .
we &apos;ll keep doing the study , right ?
come on . why ?
because it is too dangerous .
also the tumor could give us abnormal results .
what if you take the tumor out ?
i could keep doing the testing . - you could , but --
then take it out , man !
we &apos;re so close , right ?
this morning , i was miles beyond anything
what i did last time -- - it &apos;s too dangerous .
we &apos;re gonna take you out there , remove your sensors ,
and then we &apos;re gonna close
your craniotomy -- - what if i don &apos;t consent ?
what ?
what if i say you can &apos;t take your sensors back
unless you take my tumor , too ?
mickey , i need to take them out .
sorry , bud .
access denied .
you &apos;re not going in my head
unless you &apos;re leaving with that tumor .
lucky you use electro @-@ thermal sealers .
they &apos;re too big to get in there when we do these in @-@ utero .
bear with me , emma .
alex , i need your advice .
what &apos;s your strategy when you have a one @-@ night @-@ stand --
not even -- you just make out with someone ,
and then they get way too attached ?
you know who &apos;s like that ?
leah murphy .
really ?
yeah , i slept with her one , maybe two times .
she stuck to me like glue .
that girl goes from zero to &quot; i love you &quot;
in seven seconds .
i &apos;ve never , ever felt this way .
and if i tell you guys who it is ,
it would cause so many problems for me
and for this person , and ...
god , for the hospital , probably .
so please don &apos;t ask .
could it be heart @-@ related ?
he had ventricular failure .
what ?
webber &apos;s shoulder hurts .
hey , did you talk to alex ?
yeah , i tried . he just keeps running away .
he &apos;s dumping you . it &apos;s what he did with me .
he &apos;ll pretend you &apos;re not there until you &apos;re not there .
and when you &apos;re not there ,
he &apos;ll have sex with someone else .
why are you gluing my mug ?
it &apos;s not yours . it &apos;s shepherd &apos;s .
the mug was my responsibility .
how &apos;d you break it ?
she got scared by a tumor .
it &apos;s an a.v.m. , and it &apos;s a scary one .
totally inoperable .
guy probably has months to live ,
and he and is his poor wife
are just trying to make the most of their time together .
what about glue ?
what about glue ?
i &apos;m sorry . for your a.v.m.--
this a.v.m.
look , dr. shepherd was talking about the embolization glue
they use in neuro a.v.m.s , and i wondered--
has this approach ever been used in the heart ?
not that i &apos;m aware of . so ... no .
they glue neuro a.v.m.s
because they &apos;re microscopic .
these vessels are huge .
you saying it won &apos;t work ?
i &apos;m saying ...
i &apos;d need a crapload of glue .
i &apos;m saying the glue won &apos;t work ,
the radiation won &apos;t work ,
and i don &apos;t want to go in surgically .
i risk killing him .
so he &apos;s holding your sensors hostage in his skull ?
this is not funny , callie . you have to talk to him .
it &apos;s mickey . just give him a few hours .
he &apos;ll come around .
you don &apos;t want to talk to him
because you don &apos;t want to look him in the eye
and tell him you &apos;re bailing on this .
and you certainly don &apos;t want to tell him
why you &apos;re bailing .
why is that ?
you started this project for arizona .
when you lost interest in her , you lost interest in this .
you &apos;re letting your personal problems
get in the way of months of research .
well , you &apos;re doing the same thing .
you said you were done with the study
to spend time with your kids .
that &apos;s completely different .
oh , why is it different , derek ?
&apos;cause your family &apos;s perfect ,
and mine &apos;s a disaster ?
because you &apos;re leaving the study to support your wife ,
and i &apos;m doing it to forget mine ?
i know what you &apos;re going through .
you don &apos;t know anything about it .
you guys have figured it out how to make the pieces fit .
and i thought we did , too , but ...
i &apos;m figuring this out for myself now , so ...
just bear with me , okay ?
i will talk to mickey .
and i &apos;m gonna ask you a series of questions .
&quot; are you a tennis player ? &quot;
oh , good lord .
&quot; do you frequently carry heavy loads ,
groceries , etcetera , with your injured arm ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been in this bed a month .
i &apos;m just trying to be thorough .
&quot; have you recently engaged in any strenuous sexual-- &quot;
i am skipping that one ...
uh , too , uh ...
uh ... i &apos;m not getting a very good reading on ,
uh , sir , are you-- oh--oh ...
it is not my tennis game , and it &apos;s not my heart .
look deeper .
now get out , and take that thing with you .
oh , come on . i don &apos;t have time for this .
&quot; ischemia reperfusion injury in thoracic trauma &quot; ?
what happened to portal veins ?
i know ischemia is boring ,
but my mother &apos;s portal vein research is outdated .
i mean , we &apos;ve already grafted them from stem cells .
and i don &apos;t want to spend my life
being compared to my mother .
she was a smart woman .
it might be worse to never be compared to her .
i can &apos;t find a way to take the research further .
and i can &apos;t print this damn thing !
you all right ?
we &apos;ve bio @-@ engineered blood vessels
from a 3 @-@ d printer .
yeah .
but i don &apos;t think anyone has ever printed a portal vein .
it &apos;s never been done before .
the glue is designed for use in your brain ,
but i would like to try it in your heart .
it--it &apos;s a bold approach .
wai--are you-- are you saying that--
i am optimistic that it could save your life .
that &apos;s awful .
i &apos;m sorry ?
after got ben &apos;s diagnosis , well , i mean , you--you know ,
we--we--we sold everything .
we--we cashed out all our accounts .
we maxed out our credit cards and more credit cards .
we went to europe . we went to india .
we went to morocco .
we rented a whole island .
we--we went up in that plane where you get to be weightless .
that &apos;s 5 grand a pop .
we went up 11 times-- and then bought a boat .
and then we blew it up ,
&apos;cause we wanted to watch it burn .
we owe creditors hundreds of thousands of dollars .
how were you planning to pay for--
life insurance .
ben &apos;s a very good planner .
i thought i was .
i didn &apos;t plan for surviving .
but still , hon ...
we ... we gotta try it , right ?
wait .
what are the risks ?
well , as i said ,
this has never been done before on a beating heart .
could i die ?
could i die on the table ?
it &apos;s possible .
then there &apos;s hope .
i want a c @-@ arm set up in the o.r.
i may have to do a crash sternotomy .
really ?
well , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen .
this has never been done before .
how much a.v.m. glue do you think we &apos;ll need ?
again , never been done before .
err &apos;s on the side of all of it .
where is it ?
where is what ?
my mother &apos;s journal .
why would i know ?
the black book--
the little black book i gave you today--
i need it back , shane .
i think i left it with edwards .
edwards !
what ?
e.r. needs this bed . can you help me ?
hey , and what is going on with mr. bosco ?
why has a broken ankle been moved to pre @-@ op
for a cardiac procedure ?
what ?
you can &apos;t change the course of treatment like that without ...
i didn &apos;t . the cardio consult declared it inoperable .
so then why is he in pre @-@ op ? who--
who did the consult ?
dr. yang !
what ?
sorry . we were in here before ,
and i think i left my ... phone .
well , what do we have here ?
oh , a ventricular a.v.m.
i &apos;m doing liquid embolization with glue .
wait , glue for brain aneurysms ?
has that been tried on a heart before ?
thank you . as a matter of fact ,
no .
are you sure it &apos;ll work ?
that is also a no .
i @-@ i am impressed with your enormous balls .
i wish i could stick around and watch this .
i &apos;m cristina ... by the way .
cristina yang . just so you know .
yeah , i know . we &apos;ve met a couple of times , actually .
emma marling .
i know . i &apos;m--i &apos;m saying i &apos;m owen &apos;s , um ...
ex @-@ wife .
yes .
right .
well , this looks amazing .
and i can &apos;t wait to hear how it went .
good night .
you weren &apos;t gonna say good night ?
oh , hey . i &apos;m off . i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll see you later .
will you ?
probably not . i &apos;ll probably be late .
are you seeing someone else ?
is that what &apos;s happening ?
&apos;cause i just need to know .
oh , it &apos;s not that .
then what is it ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
it is between me and shepherd ,
and i told him everything he needs to know .
mickey ...
mickey , look at me .
if i do , the aliens will win .
this operation could kill you .
i never told you how i became a quad , did i ?
you were in a car accident .
i caused a car accident ...
because i was drunk . i got drunk ,
and i drove , and i hit another car ,
and i killed two teenage girls--
lindsay and cheryl .
so there i am , a pile of garbage .
can &apos;t move , can &apos;t walk , can &apos;t do anything
except think about what i did ...
to those families .
i &apos;ve got people tending to me .
people feed me ,
and shave me and clean me ,
and i don &apos;t deserve their time .
i deserve ... to have died in that car .
and i wish i did every day ...
for nine years .
and when you asked me ...
to do this ...
when i had a chance to do something
affecting someone in a good way ...
for the first time ,
i thought i was worth having around .
if i die ,
give my brain to science , and i still help .
let me help .
please .
and how can i help you ?
oh , hey . same as last night ?
yeah , thanks .
you must really like these guys , huh ?
i still think it &apos;s a bad idea .
i @-@ i know , but it &apos;s the right idea .
mickey has nothing to lose and a lot to gain .
okay , i &apos;ll schedule him for tomorrow morning .
oh , no , wait . i can &apos;t do tomorrow morning .
bailey has a well @-@ baby exam ,
i &apos;ve got back @-@ to @-@ back discotomies ,
and zola and i were gonna check out a dance class .
it &apos;s gonna have to be tonight .
zola , you and your brother are gonna have to go back to day care
for a little while longer , okay , sweetie ?
no , no , no . i &apos;ll take &apos; em back up . i got it .
here . come on . this way , babes .
page dr. ross .
okay .
more glue .
we &apos;re getting to the end of our supply .
then go get more .
i think i need to fill this whole thing .
okay ... the catheter is stuck to the vein .
god , this stuff is intense .
should you be tugging that hard ?
well , you want me to leave it in there ?
okay . okay , we &apos;re good .
how did you come up with this ?
i don &apos;t know . i just ... connected the dots .
you are full of surprises , sharky .
innovative instincts and killer instincts--
what other secrets are hiding in there ?
what do you think you &apos;ll find ?
well , if it &apos;s not arthritis or bursitis or rotator cuff ,
and your heart &apos;s fine , then it can &apos;t hurt .
unless it &apos;s referred pain , which could be nerve impingement
or diaphragmatic irritation , so ...
you don &apos;t need an x @-@ ray .
bravo .
you need an ultrasound .
well , i hope you &apos;re not thinking i &apos;m pregnant !
page dr. edwards here stat . right away .
i need an ultrasound .
are you pregnant ? does alex know ?
no , i @-@ i need an ultrasound machine .
have you seen edwards ?
does alex think i &apos;m pregnant ?
i have a mug like that .
where the hell have you been ?
uh , i thought you were leaving ,
and dr. yang and i found
a left ventricle a.v.m.
yeah , well , you &apos;re here now . scrub in .
i &apos;d rather not .
shane , you gotta get past this .
you &apos;re not a consolation prize .
you deserve to be here .
brooks had a gift that needed to be ...
i don &apos;t wanna work with you .
i &apos;m not interested .
can i be more clear ?
i suppose not .
go .
to a certain extent , time will tell .
what we know for sure is we &apos;ve done no damage to your heart ,
and at this preliminary stage ,
it appears the a.v.m. won &apos;t continue to grow .
so you &apos;re saying ...
i &apos;ll live ?
yes .
dear god .
ben ? honey ?
i know .
we &apos;ll be all right .
i know it &apos;s a lot of money . it &apos;s been a crazy year ,
but the world is a lot more fun with you in it .
as long as we have each other , everything will be fine .
joyce , we &apos;re screwed .
i know .
we &apos;re not just bankrupt . we &apos;re criminals .
i think we might go to jail .
oh , we &apos;re so incredibly screwed .
like a $ 2 whore .
yang , that &apos;s my broken ankle .
how about a little heads @-@ up
next time you wanna steal one of my patients ?
what happened to them ?
i saved his life .
so i get that you saved him ,
but he was my patient , and you should &apos;ve told me before you ...
i came up with the fix . you didn &apos;t .
if you &apos;re still pissed about what happened the other night .
i ... i &apos;m with jackson .
it was inappropriate , and it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
what are you talking about ?
when you kissed me , shane .
oh . that .
we were excited . it happened .
i &apos;m sorry it meant more to you--
it didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re still talking about it .
what &apos;s happened to you ?
what are you guys whispering about ?
nothing .
god , you guys , fine .
it &apos;s arizona robbins .
but please don &apos;t say anything , okay ?
because she really doesn &apos;t need ...
robbins ?
so ... you &apos;re gay now ?
shane , grow up . it &apos;s a sliding scale .
i slide over her way .
if you really have to label everything ,
then label me &quot; in love . &quot;
murphy !
i &apos;m sorry . they pretty much figured it out .
no . i &apos;m sorry , because i &apos;m about to be very frank .
the other night was a bad call on my part .
i was lonely , and it was ... lovely .
but it was-- it was one night ,
and that &apos;s all that it will ever be ,
so if you had different expectations ,
please adjust them .
of course .
there &apos;s no need to apologize . it &apos;s my fault .
i don &apos;t open up to people much ,
and when i try to open up a little bit ,
i can get carried away . it &apos;s happened before .
and you ...
i &apos;ve just always admired you as ... a surgeon ,
and--and a person ,
and the thought that you thought about me ...
i misunderstood .
um , i went overboard , and i &apos;m sorry .
it won &apos;t happen again .
leah ...
thank you for understanding .
gin , rocks .
you gonna charge me again ?
most places comp the bands , you know ?
i got this one .
appreciate that .
jimmy evans .
hey .
i know you .
i &apos;ve , uh , been here the last couple of nights .
no . something else .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re a doctor ...
at the hospital .
guilty .
what brings you back here every night ?
oh , uh , you . i mean , i like your set .
uh , i like the albert collins stuff .
ah . you got a good ear , then . you play ?
my dad taught me a little when i was a kid ,
but , uh , he didn &apos;t stick with it .
aw , you should have stuck with it .
look where it could &apos;ve taken you .
i mean , instead of saving people &apos;s lives ,
you could be playing 70 @-@ year @-@ old songs
to four people in a giant ashtray .
what kind of doctor are you ?
pediatric surgeon .
babies , kids .
i met a pediatric surgeon once .
scariest night of my life .
my son &apos;s not even 2 years old .
i &apos;m feeding him strawberries , and he starts choking .
turned blue .
we take him in , they get him breathing again .
pediatric surgeon runs the tube down his throat ,
and got the thing out .
saved my boy &apos;s life . saved my life , too .
if i &apos;d lost my little boy that night ,
i never would &apos;ve made it . i never would &apos;ve survived .
i &apos;m glad it worked out for you .
yeah . thank god for you guys , man . seriously .
so where is he ?
now , i mean . where &apos;s your family ?
that &apos;s a complicated answer .
this place has really cleared out .
i guess i was the big draw .
yeah , well ...
i probably should head out myself .
i was gonna say , you play a little ?
i got an extra guitar .
we can get up and make some noise .
no . no , i haven &apos;t played since i was a kid .
well , there &apos;s no one here to hear you suck .
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
i don &apos;t know any songs .
what about the songs your daddy taught you ?
i might know one of those .
am i hearing changes in his rhythm ?
turn up the heart monitor , please .
done .
more mannitol .
rhythm &apos;s getting very erratic , and--and b.p. &apos; s rising .
quiet . quiet .
all right . reverse the paralytics .
all right , let me check his gag reflexes .
oh , no , mickey . come on . no .
dr. shepherd , there &apos;s no brain activity .
that is a ...
pancreatic pseudocyst ! bam !
did you just say &quot; bam &quot; ?
it had to be referred pain , right ?
but referred pain to the shoulder
means irritation of the diaphragm ,
which did not make sense , but ...
you have pancreatic fluid leakage ,
so i was thinking , well , maybe something
was aggravating the diaphragm ,
which referred to the shoulder ,
and bam !
pancreatic pseudocyst .
maybe you should wipe that smile off your face
before you tell the patient .
oh , god . i am so sorry .
i @-@ i forgot that this is bad news .
and ... you &apos;re laughing .
for the first time today , i feel like i &apos;m in good hands .
nice work , wilson .
you traced it back to the source .
hey ! i &apos;m doing my mother &apos;s research ,
but not for the reasons you said i should .
not now , grey .
she had a good idea !
i &apos;m not riding her coattails . i am sharing her passion .
maybe this is what my mother gave me .
your daddy taught you pretty good .
* go ahead *
* pretty baby *
* go ahead , knock yourself out *
* i still love you , baby *
* &apos; cause you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s all about *
* bright lights *
* big city *
* gone to my baby &apos;s head *
* bright lights *
* big city *
you okay ?
you know ... that &apos;s a good tune .
brings back a lot .
you know , if you &apos;re not careful ,
all your old mistakes can just roll up on you .
i taught my kid to play guitar , too .
it &apos;s like you said .
i wish i &apos;d had stuck with it .
well , your kid probably does , too .
yeah , but there &apos;s no going back , is there ?
can i show you a picture of him ?
my boy ?
what , you have one ?
that &apos;s nicky .
he &apos;s 5 there . he &apos;d be about 12 now .
and , uh , that &apos;s his mom , naomi .
she &apos;s japanese .
who &apos;s ...
where are they ?
south florida .
i haven &apos;t been back there in years .
god , you just keep doing this .
what do you mean ?
do this kid a favor . don &apos;t ever go back .
let him grow up
without knowing you any more that he already has .
what the hell , man ?
he &apos;s better off . you know that .
what &apos;s your problem ?
we were having fun here .
i &apos;m trying to protect your kid . you &apos;re no good to him .
hey , you don &apos;t know me , and you don &apos;t talk about my kid .
hey ! no !
out !
you , out , now !
this way , you can do the most good for the most people .
you think so ?
he would be grateful .
you did exactly what he wanted .
i &apos;m not dropping the project .
you were right .
i was doing it for her .
and now i will do it for a million people
i &apos;ll never even meet .
and for mickey .
i could really use your help .
we were just starting to learn
the extent of the brain &apos;s connections ...
how far they reach , how deep they go .
i think i &apos;ve ceased to exist .
i made history today , literally .
operated on the inoperable ,
saved a man from certain death ,
and then ruined his life .
oh , also owen
seems very happy with that marling person
to whom he has never even mentioned me .
it &apos;s as if the last few years never happened .
also , the automatic paper towel thingy
won &apos;t recognize me as human .
i &apos;m just standing there , waving my hands like an idiot .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
what are you doing ?
application for research funding .
oh , you picked your project .
i &apos;m gonna 3 @-@ d print portal veins .
that is amazing , mer .
how are you gonna do that--
okay , don &apos;t .
it &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you .
i have a career and a family ,
and i &apos;m going to do both .
what i don &apos;t have time for is for you to tell me that i can &apos;t .
i never said that .
you know , i was always there for you ,
for whatever you needed .
and now this is when i need you ,
and you &apos;re supposed to help me .
and instead , last week you pushed me aside
because i had a baby .
you don &apos;t have time for me now ?
because you don &apos;t have time
for people who want things that you don &apos;t want .
but we know that every connection matters .
every connection is crucial .
i @-@ i @-@ i have to finish this .
and when one is broken ...
it usually means some damage has been done .
i can &apos;t figure it out if you &apos;re seeing someone else
or you think that you knocked me up ,
so ...
i tried to trace it back to the root of the problem ,
and i think it &apos;s your dad .
look , i told you--
not to bring it up again , i know ,
and this is the last time , because if i &apos;m wrong--
you &apos;re not wrong . you should be proud of yourself .
i could &apos;ve let him just pass through ,
but you were all &quot; talk to him ,
you &apos;ll wonder for the rest of your life . &quot;
well , thanks .
i didn &apos;t know i could feel this crappy again
after 18 frickin &apos; years !
this system of connections compels us to act
and choose and behave ...
sometimes seemingly against our own will .

but it is not random at all .
it is the map of who we are .
did you get my text ?
sorry . i was stuck there .
i had to get this thing out by tonight .
i got hung up , too .
i just barely got them down .
just now ?
i know .
it &apos;s so late .
i know . i tried .
it &apos;s not working .
no , it isn &apos;t .
we just can &apos;t seem to make the pieces fit .
i agree , but i don &apos;t know how--
i think i do .
i wanna spend more time on this b.c.i. research .
torres and i ... blew it wide open today .
so you wanna take on more ?
no .
less , actually .
this is a big year for you ,
and you need time to make it work .
i had a big year . i can step back ,
scale down the surgery , focus on this research ,
spend time with the kids ,
and give you the slack you need
to make this year count .
i don &apos;t like it .
wh--
you &apos;ll resent me ,
and so will the kids ,
and ... i don &apos;t wanna be my mother .
you &apos;re not your mother . you know that .
we will work to understand ourselves ...
solve the puzzle ...
it feels unfair .
spending time with the kids is not a consolation prize .
it is the prize .
you want fair ? maybe down the road ,
i &apos;ll give you a year with them .
maybe when zola &apos;s dating ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t wanna be around for that .
i love you .
well , you should . what i &apos;m doing is amazing for you .
you &apos;re gonna have more fun than me .
i know . oh , so that &apos;s where that went .
yeah . is that ours ?
yes .
how all the connections work
and all the pieces ...
