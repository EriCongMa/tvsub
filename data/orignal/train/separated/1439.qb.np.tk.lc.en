okay , let &apos;s see ...
oh , could , you grab me an extra virgin ...
i think one &apos;s enough for the sacrifice .
olive oil , phil .
come on . that &apos;s funny .
oh , it &apos;s funnier than your freestyle &quot; sandwich rap . &quot;
girl , you crazy .
i &apos;m mad fun to shop with .
trapped in between two whole wheat slices .
pastrami and swiss are my only vices .
sweetie , my shoe . come on . jesus . god .
hello .
hi .
oh , roadblock .
beep beep !
pardon me .
are you okay ?
actually , not okay .
not okay .
honey , did you pull from the bottom again ?
so after hors d &apos;oeuvres ,
we &apos;ll bring everyone in here to share the news .
we &apos;re having the family over tomorrow night
to tell them we &apos;re planning on adopting a new baby .
yes , and we both agreed
to--to go a little more low @-@ key with the announcement this time .
* let &apos;s hear it for the boy ... *
okay , just to be clear , this is low @-@ key ?
it &apos;s a banner
and just some light musical accompaniment , mitchell .
i don &apos;t have a lower key .
besides , this is a happy occasion .
am i right , lily ?
aren &apos;t you excited to get a new baby brother ?
no ! i hate the baby !
we are having a slight issue
getting lily on board with the adoption .
&quot; i hate the baby . &quot;
&quot; no new baby . &quot;
&quot; i wanna make the baby dead . &quot;
i thought we weren &apos;t gonna share that one .
i @-@ i @-@ i just hope that the problem is
she hasn &apos;t spent much time with any babies .
so we thought it would be a great idea
to show her how much fun it &apos;ll be to have one around .
oh , he is so cute !
yeah , and he never cries .
literally never . it &apos;s actually a little weird .
oh , no , that &apos;s not weird .
my sister was born with a full set of teeth .
yeah , that never happened .
no ? really ? you should &apos;ve seen her crib .
it looked like beavers lived there .
oh , is this lily ?
oh , yes , it is . hey , honey . say hi to the baby .
my daddy !
okay , so that &apos;s one problem solved .
第三季 第二集
bye ! see you soon !
or never .
cam , i &apos;m a little freaked out about what lily did .
oh , please . she barely touched him ,
and he went from zero to big crybaby .
we &apos;re talking about bringing another child into this house .
how &apos;s that gonna work with lily being so possessive of you ?
why am i hearing an accusatory tone ?
oh , come on . you have to admit that you do coddle her .
i will not apologize for loving our daughter .
i &apos;m not criticizing .
i &apos;m not only criticizing ,
but we did talk about giving lily a little more independence .
yeah , which is why we put her in preschool .
yes , but you can &apos;t bear to leave her there .
you always pick her up early .
that is ridiculous .
okay . okay .
lily , honey ,
did daddy pick you up early from preschool today ?
no .
case closed .
we didn &apos;t go .
case opened .
we went shopping .
that &apos;s enough .
we bought matchy hats .
you are going to your room .
you &apos;re both going to her room .
do we spend a lot of time together ? yes .
do we have a special bond ? absolutely .
but do i coddle her more than any other loving parent ?
it &apos;s possible .
and for lily &apos;s sake , i should probably work on that .
no , you calm down !
this is how i talk when somebody accuses my manny of stealing .
who is that ?
it &apos;s the principal .
he &apos;s saying that manny stole some girl &apos;s locket .
what , do you think that all colombians are criminals ,
because a colombian necktie
is a symbol of violence all over the world ?
no , no , i &apos;m not threatening you .
okay . apology accepted .
no , i didn &apos;t mean anything about the necktie .
i just--i was trying to make a point .
could you &quot; l. &quot; a little less &quot; o.l. &quot;
don &apos;t you see what i &apos;m trying to do here ?
die alone ?
girls , dinner !
you know , why does luke get his own room ,
and i still have to share with you ? i can &apos;t take it anymore .
me either , even if it is just for one more year ...
when i leave for college .
it is one more year or when you leave for college ?
because those happen to be two different things .
so i hear this little voice coming from the cans
and it &apos;s like ...
&quot; help ! i fell in the peaches ! &quot;
that &apos;s mom !
hilarious !
so hilarious .
i &apos;m like , &quot; claire ? &quot;
you might wanna tell them that it was you
who pushed me into the peaches in the first place .
this again ? i wasn &apos;t even near you .
yes , you were ! you knocked me with the cart .
it was completely your fault .
well , let &apos;s just agree to disagree .
no . i @-@ i disagree to disagree .
then you agree .
no . no , i don &apos;t , because i &apos;m right .
okay , claire . you &apos;re right .
as usual .
no , i am right .
like always .
stop it . when i am wrong , i admit it .
which is never .
fine . fine .
you &apos;re a little jumpy tonight , manny . anything wrong ?
no . well , i &apos;m just gonna--
have a seat , kid .
you know , maybe it &apos;s me ,
but i thought you were kinda squirrelly tonight , you know ,
before when your mom was on the phone with the principal .
almost like you wanted to say something ...
but you just couldn &apos;t .
anything you wanna say now , manny ?
no . i have nothing to say .
you sure about that ?
think real hard .
could i get a glass of water ?
that girl &apos;s locket-- you took it , didn &apos;t you ?
didn &apos;t you ?
yes.yes , i took it .
i didn &apos;t mean to .
i don &apos;t wanna hear any excuses .
you &apos;re gonna tell your mom , and you &apos;re gonna set this right .
do you understand ?
all right , get out of here .
just one more thing .
you &apos;re not , um ...
you &apos;re not wearing that locket , are you ?
no . of course not .
it &apos;s a girl &apos;s . why would i want to wear it ?
it &apos;s no reason .
mom , hurry up ! i don &apos;t want to be late for school .
you didn &apos;t tell her , did you ?
what &apos;s the hurry this morning ?
okay , what &apos;s with the looks ?
it &apos;s like a silent movie in here . okay .
i was walking behind this girl alicia , who &apos;s moving away ,
and i was working up the courage to get her new address
so i can write her .
i express myself a lot better on paper than--
ticktock , kid .
well , she dropped her locket , and i picked it up ,
but she kept walking , and i ...
you stole the locket .
after i told the principal
that you could have never done something like that ,
and i threaten him with the colombian necktie !
manny , why ?
don &apos;t worry . it wasn &apos;t &apos; cause he wanted to wear it .
i thought i could keep it as something to remember her by .
but then you were yelling at mr. vickers ,
and i @-@ i was just too scared to tell you .
go to the car .
i &apos;m really sorry .
go .
why would he do something like that ?
it &apos;s bad enough that he &apos;s the boy
with the pan flute and the puffy shirts and--and the poems .
now he &apos;s the jewelry thief .
might be an upgrade .
ay , jay , this is not funny .
those things stick to you .
my cousin rosa marina--
when she was 14 , she stole something , and after that ,
everybody thinks of her as the girl who steals cars .
she stole a car ?
cars .
but after she got that label , what else could she do ?
listen , you can &apos;t control what kids think ,
but you can make sure he learns from this .
you take him to the principal &apos;s office ,
he owns up to it , he never does it again .
okay . okay .
but what was he thinking ?
this is not even real gold .
no way , haley ! it was my idea ! i &apos;m taking this room !
over my dead body !
this is going to be my room ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it !
seriously ?
what are you guys fighting about ?
okay , so we both think
that this would make a totally awesome bedroom .
but only one of us can have it .
don &apos;t you think it should be me ?
oh , so not . it should be me . right , luke ?
why do you guys wanna move into the attic ?
oh , you mean &quot; the penthouse &quot; ?
with all the privacy of being on its very own floor ?
it is kinda cool .
i &apos;m not an idiot .
i knew what they were up to ,
but i &apos;ve been wanting to move for a while .
there &apos;s a line of ants
going to a trick @-@ or @-@ treat bag in my closet ,
and i don &apos;t want to still be there
when they get tired of candy .
good morning , princess .
good morning , lily .
very adorable , mitchell ,
but i &apos;m having kind of a rough morning ,
daddy , up .
i &apos;m sorry , lily , those days are over .
now here &apos;s your lunch .
go get your bag . we will be leaving shortly .
cam , you don &apos;t have to ice her out completely .
do you think i &apos;m enjoying this ?
but i need her to detach from me before the new thing comes
or who knows what she &apos;ll do to it .
why are you saying &quot; thing &quot; instead of &quot; baby &quot; ?
kill the new baby .
oh . um , look , i @-@ i @-@ i know this is hard ,
but i really appreciate what you &apos;re doing .
and believe me ,
i take no pleasure in seeing you suffer like this .
i take a little pleasure .
no , but there--there are very few parenting issues
where i come out on top .
you know , i &apos;m distant . i work too much .
my french braiding is &quot; sloppy . &quot;
finally , you know , something that isn &apos;t my fault .
ready .
could you please just go put her in her car seat
while i compose myself ?
all right , you know what , cam ?
why don &apos;t i just take lily to preschool on my way to work ?
i think that would be best .
let me just whip up a smoothie for you before you go .
i push the buttons , daddy .
you certainly do .
what do you think the principal &apos;s going to do to me ?
i am a first @-@ time offender .
oh , great . now i &apos;m tardy . strike two .
manny , think of this in a positive way ,
like it is your &quot; ha ha &quot; moment .
what does that mean ?
that means that one day , you &apos;re gonna laugh about it .
ah , i should &apos;ve just given that stupid necklace back to alicia
when she was standing right next to her locker .
this is the worst day of my life ,
till tomorrow ... oh .
and every day after that . oh .
come on , mom . let &apos;s get this over with .
wait .
what ?
which one did you say that it was her locker ? this one ?
mm @-@ hmm . the one that smells like rose oil .
mom ?
keep the lookout .
now promise me that you will never , ever do anything dishonest again .
i promise .
okay , because that &apos;s not the way i raised you .
don &apos;t tell jay anything , okay ?
hi , lily .
all right , lily .
hi . have fun , sweetheart .
bye .
she is so sweet .
oh , thanks . well , you should &apos;ve seen her yesterday .
yeah , she pushed a baby off of cam &apos;s lap .
i know . i know .
she is so possessive of him , but , you know ,
cam &apos;s really working on trying not to coddle her so much ,
so ...
i &apos;m not really sure it &apos;s about coddling .
sounds more like a sharing issue .
you know , we &apos;ve noticed lily has a hard time with that .
really ?
i wouldn &apos;t worry .
kids usually pick that habit up from other kids ,
except the ones that pick it up from their parents .
we have a few of those in here .
of course , i can &apos;t share those names with you ...
until i get a glass of wine in my hand .
oh . oh , miss elaine .
i have been told that i might have the teensiest issue with sharing .
but is that something lily would even pick up on ?
my chicken .
my pillow .
daddy &apos;s pen .
okay , it &apos;s possible .
and i suppose for lily &apos;s sake , i @-@ i should work on that ...
privately. because right now we really need to
get cam &apos;s coddling problem under control .
what &apos;s going on ?
moving into the attic .
give me a day or two to get settled , then i &apos;ll have you up .
when did all this happen ?
depends on who you ask .
my plan &apos;s been in motion for three weeks .
honey , this is a terrible idea . you &apos;re gonna hate it up there .
mom , stay out of this .
yeah . we all have our own rooms now . everybody wins .
well , don &apos;t get too comfortable in there , girls .
luke , it &apos;s cold , and it &apos;s scary up there .
you &apos;re gonna be back in your own room by tomorrow night .
i don &apos;t know , claire . it &apos;s got a lot of potential .
this is a lot nicer than the attic i lived in when we met .
one night , if that . trust me on this .
oh , yes , because you &apos;re always right .
sweetheart , i would love to be wrong .
i just don &apos;t live with the right people for that .
let it go , kids . she &apos;s not gonna budge .
kept me up all night with the--
phil , you did push me !
your word against mine .
guess it &apos;s one of those things we &apos;ll just never know ,
like what really happened to the &quot; titanic . &quot;
it hit an iceberg .
maybe .
mm , there &apos;s no maybe .
oh , you &apos;re right , claire .
again .
surprise , surprise .
okay , i @-@ i will see you over at uncle mitchell &apos;s .
i &apos;m gonna skip this meeting of the pile @-@ on claire club .
guess i pushed her into that pile , too .
i spend half my life waiting on you .
how many times do you have to change your outfit ?
sorry , jay . too many choices is a prison .
just drive before he rethinks the pants .
what &apos;s wrong with my pants ? !
go . go . go .
so , manny , how &apos;d it go with the principal today ?
it was terrible , but he was brave , and now it &apos;s over .
right , manny ?
mm @-@ hmm .
so d--
what &apos;d they give you ? detention ? suspension ?
no , just a warning because it was first offense .
so how was work ?
great .
just a warning , huh ?
like she said .
so i ask about work , and you change the subject .
are you trying to hide something ?
no , i just wanna make sure he &apos;s okay . you okay ?
&apos;cause , i mean , it looks like you &apos;re sweatin &apos; bullets back there , kid .
stop grilling him . first the principal , now you .
this poor boy has been screamed at all day .
well , not to mention--
quiet ! i &apos;ve got this .
where is lily ?
um , she &apos;s getting dressed .
all by herself ?
cam is encouraging her to be more independent .
oh .
and there she is !
doesn &apos;t she look beautiful ?
she looks like she was dipped in glue ,
and dragged through a flea market .
hey there !
hi !
guys . come on in . there &apos;s hors d &apos;oeuvres .
how &apos;s it going ?
hey , do you guys have any old furniture ?
i &apos;m moving into the attic .
the attic ?
hey , at least it &apos;s big .
grandpa said you used to live in the closet .
okay . well , you know what ?
yeah , we &apos;ll absolutely find you something for sure . okay ?
my daddy !
lily , no !
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , luke .
this isn &apos;t over .
oh , my god . mitchell , she &apos;s getting worse .
i have turned her into a pushy , little , entitled monster ,
on her way to a rap sheet and a bracelet on her ankle .
oh , she has a bracelet on her ankle .
cam .
cam , cam .
this--this might not be entirely your fault .
no , it is .
i spoke with lily &apos;s teacher .
and she thinks that--that she may have a problem with sharing ,
which she might have gotten from--
you . you don &apos;t like to share .
no , i do it to make a point sometimes .
like , if you want the chicken , then order the chicken .
wait , when did you talk to lily &apos;s teacher ?
uh , today , when i--when i dropped her off at school .
and you let me suffer all day ?
all right , look , we--we can &apos;t do this with everybody here .
can we please just get through the evening ?
yes ,
but we are not making the announcement tonight .
because that is a joyful thing ,
and i am not feeling very joyful right now .
well , i share your feeling .
just so you know , i &apos;m on to you .
you never took manny to the principal .
okay , play it like that , but i know manny .
he has more of a conscience than you have .
he &apos;s not gonna be able to live with this .
you &apos;d be surprised what people can live with , jay .
hi , miss lily . how &apos;s my big girl doing ?
good .
can you tell me how old you are now ?
3 .
that &apos;s 4 . this is 3 .
okay , show me again . how old are you ?
3 .
no ! that many is 4 .
this many is 3 .
don &apos;t argue , lily . you &apos;ll never win .
really , phil ?
okay , i @-@ i was gonna wait until we got home for this ,
but now i think it &apos;s something everyone &apos;s gonna enjoy .
guys , everybody , come on down to the tv room .
i &apos;ve got something really special to share .
okay , how &apos;s everybody on drinks ?
if this is alex &apos;s graduation again , just leave me the bottle .
i &apos;m good , cam .
okay , everybody .
showtime .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s us at the market .
how did you--
yeah , it &apos;s security camera footage .
i don &apos;t understand . what are we watching ?
it ain &apos;t &quot; the godfather , &quot; i can tell you that much .
okay , look , i fell yesterday at the market ,
and phil and i have been having a little disagreement
as to what happened . just watch . okay , right here .
i stop to fix my shoe , and then phil--
right there . okay .
he makes way for this very attractive woman ,
whom he conveniently leaves out of his retelling of the story .
now right here , phil backs up ,
pushes his butt into the cart ,
pushes me into the cans !
do you see that ? ! oh !
it &apos;s all his fault , just like i said !
i was right ! suck it !
when did you get this--
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why you wanted to come separately .
you went to all that trouble just to prove you were right ?
it really wasn &apos;t that much trouble .
i just went to the store , found your friend jordan the bag boy ,
who got me the manager .
he gave me the address of the off @-@ site security office .
i filled out some paperwork . sally faxed it to corporate .
three minutes later , i &apos;m buying pack of dvds and burning a copy .
cake .
it &apos;s like a sickness .
what ? none of you believed me ,
so i got proof .
you should all be sucking it right now .
hey , please stop with the &quot; sucking it , &quot; claire .
the children !
yes , children are very impressionable .
you &apos;ll never know what they &apos;ll pick up .
okay , cam , i &apos;m sorry that i blamed it on you , okay ?
but we both need to look at our actions .
i mean , if we &apos;re thinking about adopting another baby ,
then we need to--
you guys ...
you &apos;re adopting another kid ?
no ! no , no !
you &apos;re--wait ! congratulations !
we &apos;re thinking about it . it &apos;s not ...
what the hell &apos;s happening here ?
is that from &quot; footloose &quot; ?
really , mitchell ?
you couldn &apos;t even share telling your family !
fine . fine .
but why are you upset ? this is such good news .
no , we &apos;re a little on edge
because lily has been acting out
like she doesn &apos;t want a sibling , and--
yeah , because mitchell taught her to hate sharing .
and / or because cam wears her like a fanny pack .
oh , stop blaming each other .
no kid wants a sibling .
i mean , claire hated you so much
she stuck you in a dryer when you were 2 .
you put me in the dryer ?
i did , but it wasn &apos;t &apos; cause i hated you .
my friend marci said
that it wouldn &apos;t run with a kid inside it ,
and i knew it would . i was right .
good governor .
it &apos;s been going on since you were 5 ?
oh , my god . it is a sickness .
yeah .
what would make me have that need at such a young age ?
how long was i in that dryer ? because i--
is this why i &apos;m afraid of tumbling ?
i had to quit gymnastics , claire !
a childhood without tumbling ?
you knew this and just stood by and did nothing ? !
okay , okay . what &apos;s done is done !
all you can do is learn from your mistakes .
and in that spirit ,
i would like to propose a toast ... to manny .
this week , he did something he wasn &apos;t supposed to do ,
like we all do--
like we all do !
salud to manny !
uh , not yet .
but manny stood up like a man .
he admitted he was wrong and he took his licks ,
and i &apos;m damn proud of him .
ah , now we clink !
no , we clink when i say we clink .
so manny made a mistake , but he didn &apos;t take the easy way out .
he &apos;s got guts , he &apos;s got integrity .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , he &apos;s the best little b--
okay , stop ! stop ! i didn &apos;t do any of that .
mom broke into the locker and threw the necklace inside ,
and then we ran away like cowards .
i &apos;m sorry , jay ! i &apos;m sorry !
i knew it !
i was right ! i was right !
who is it ?
hi , honey . it &apos;s just me . are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m great .
so , how you liking your new digs ?
i know you told me that i &apos;d be cold ...
and scared ...
but i &apos;m not .
no , i can see that .
i was--i was wrong .
you were .
yeah .
well , you &apos;re gonna hate this then , honey ,
but i &apos;m gonna need you to go back down and sleep in your old room .
i just--i &apos;m worried if you get something so cool
this early in your life ,
you &apos;re not gonna have anything to look forward to later .
i @-@ i have to go now ?
you can spend the night tonight here if you want .
oh ! no , if it &apos;s so important to you ,
i &apos;ll go now .
you should come , too .
something sleeps over there .
