what ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe like 60 .
how is that my fault ? business is slow .
shoot .
what ? not you .
no , i ain &apos;t hiding nothing .
well , hey , i got an idea for you .
how about you put on these heels
and let &apos;s see how much money you make .
well , until you start earning better than me ,
we got nothing to talk about , ok ?
bye .
it &apos;s the ninth inning .
bases are loaded .
do you believe it , sports fans ?
on the mound is future hall @-@ of @-@ fame kai struthers ,
pitching to his own grandpa .
the count is 3 and 2 .
will kai be able to handle the pressure ?
he winds up , here &apos;s the pitch--
a perfect strike !
the cubs win ! the cubs win ! yay !
kai !
now that you &apos;ve won the world series ,
i need you to go pick up all your presents , ok ?
ok , dad . thanks for the mitt , grandpa .
you &apos;re welcome .
subito ! subito ! subito ! come on .
ohh , and he even speaks italian .
well , that &apos;s what happens
when an american pianist marries an italian basketball player .
perfecto .
kai is so happy you &apos;re here ,
especially since joy couldn &apos;t be .
speaking of which , where is that wayward daughter of mine
reporting from now ?
sierra leone .
she got stuck in customs .
it killed her to miss this party today , but ,
work , you know ?
oh , i can relate to that work thing .
ooh , she would kill me
if she saw the house right now .
and i &apos;m sorry--
no , no , no , it &apos;s my fault .
i should know better than to come between kids and cake .
go ahead . i &apos;ll get this .
uh , david &apos;s still here and--
is everything good ?
yeah .
we have an unexpected guest .
hayden .
hello , david .
grandma !
ohh , there &apos;s my little lightning bug . ohh ...
i , uh ...
i didn &apos;t know you were coming .
neither did i.
hayden , you told me that you weren &apos;t going to come .
i wasn &apos;t .
when i heard that david was coming ,
i didn &apos;t want to intrude .
then i realized how foolish that was .
i suppose we should talk , shouldn &apos;t we ?
yeah .
we should .
come on , kai .
29 years .
29 years you didn &apos;t tell me that i had a daughter .
you &apos;re right .
and when i found out ,
i called and texted you for a week straight
and never got one reply .
you &apos;re right .
you don &apos;t have anything better to say than &quot; you &apos;re right &quot; ?
no .
i--i know we weren &apos;t married long , but ...
this isn &apos;t like you .
you never did anything without good reason .
you are right .
then what changed now ?
why did you decide to show up now ?
because i knew that i couldn &apos;t keep doing this .
that we had to get it behind us
if we were going to be the kind of grandparents
that kai deserves .
so if you have anything that you need to say ,
say it now .
you never gave me a chance to be a dad .
why ?
because i always came second with you .
that &apos;s not true .
it is true , david .
it was always about the job , and you made that very clear .
the job came first .
so where would that leave our child ?
still , you could have given me a choice .
and what would you have chosen ?
hey ! look , look , look !
sorry , i tried to keep him in the next room .
oh , that &apos;s all right . come on ,
show me what you &apos;ve got there , darling .
stick &apos; em up !
ooh , stick &apos; em up .
ohh ! that &apos;s your voice .
so , uh , hey , kai , what else can that hot rod do , huh ?
show grandpa .
i , uh ,
i &apos;ve gotta take this .
mm . look .
go ahead , hotch .
hey . i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i just got a call from sacramento p.d.
about two jane does .
what &apos;s the connection ?
both were found in the same sro water reserve tank .
both had their faces slashed repeatedly .
water burial . female offender ?
no . given the physical strength required ,
we ruled it out .
i need you to meet us in sacramento .
yeah , i &apos;ll be there .
listen ,
i , uh ...
grandpa &apos;s got to go .
already ?
unfortunately , yes .
um , we &apos;re a man down ,
and my team needs me .
we totally get it .
you want some cake for the road ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m good .
i love you , kiddo .
it &apos;s good to see you , david .
maybe we can do this again some other time .
take care , hayden .
dani , baby ,
where you been at , girl ?
around .
hey , slow down .
i said ...
slow down .
how &apos;s about a little , um ,
quid pro quo ?
i &apos;m off it .
girl , like you ain &apos;t never gonna be straight .
let me go !
or what ?
hey ! enough .
oh , she &apos;s your piece ?
ok .
i &apos;ll see you around , dani .
you all right ?
no . that guy &apos;s a jerk .
ok . you need a ride somewhere ?
hey , no strings . just a ride .
my van &apos;s right up there .
i &apos;m good .
ok . cool .
uh , just be careful .
i passed some guys like your buddy a few blocks up .
wait , uh ...
you swear no strings ?
yeah , i mean ,
i already have a girlfriend . so ...
oh , sorry . i forgot . front &apos;s full .
would you mind , uh ...
what the hell ?
inner beauty
&quot; i imagine one of the reasons
&quot; people cling to their hates so stubbornly
&quot; is because they sense once hate is gone ,
they will be forced to deal with pain . &quot;
james baldwin .
the two janes does were found in an sro reserve water tank
in the oak park community of sacramento .
that area has a high crime rate ,
115 % higher than the national average .
yeah , it &apos;s known for its drug usage .
and from the track marks on our victims &apos; arms ,
it &apos;s apparent they were familiar with the needle .
so this could be a drug deal gone wrong or an angry pimp .
and given the surroundings ,
it &apos;s possible these two worked as prostitutes .
we should also consider that he &apos;s a moral enforcer .
he could be a vigilante trying to clean up the streets .
and oak park would be a target rich environment for him .
all right , when we land , jj , meet rossi at the crime scene .
you two go to the m.e. , and i &apos;ll get us set up at the precinct .
agent hotchner .
detective .
thanks for coming out .
of course .
we &apos;ve amped up patrols like you suggested .
good . anything ?
nothing from the units ,
but we did manage to i.d. one of the victims .
debi leitelt , 22 , living on the streets .
10 separate arrests for solicitation and drug possession .
her fingerprints were in the system .
yeah . 4 of these arrests involve isaac henry .
we need to talk to him right away .
i &apos;ll get on it .
thanks .
you &apos;re with oak park police ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbii .
fbi ?
ok , ok . first , i didn &apos;t know she was a minor .
second , the sign saying we crossed the state line ,
it was like this big . no warnings , nothing .
what &apos;s your relationship with debi leitelt ?
i can &apos;t say i know a debi .
that &apos;s not true . september 3 , pandering ,
september 18 , pandering ,
october 5 , november 14 .
all right .
all right . so what ?
so you two worked together .
yeah .
did you ever get violent with her ?
i didn &apos;t have to . the drugs took care of that .
why is it the fbi &apos;s problem how i treat my girl ?
it &apos;s this department &apos;s problem how you treat them .
but when they turn up dead , it &apos;s ours .
debi ?
and i thought she was gonna make it .
make it how ?
she want--she wanted out .
she got herself clean .
i never keep my girls on the street unless they want . never .
god almighty .
is that how she normally dressed ?
yeah , why ?
because we found her wearing this .
oh , yeah . this ?
not her style .
too square .
hi . it &apos;s your friendly neighborhood tech analyst .
garcia , i need you to look up
manufacture and purchase history
on the dress that debi leitelt was found in .
the blue dress ?
when and where it was purchased and if anywhere locally .
dress history . i &apos;m on it , sir .
thanks .
i don &apos;t get it . if it &apos;s not her dress , whose is it ?
the unsub redressed her .
the question is whether it was pre or postmortem .
why would he do that ?
it &apos;s part of his fantasy .
garcia said the current residents checked out .
just your run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill
&quot; leave me alone , i &apos;m feeding off my own misery &quot; type .
well , it &apos;s probably less crowded at night ,
or at least the unsub draws less attention .
everybody agrees to look the other way .
getting in and out with a body
would be extremely difficult , though .
ok , so the question is ,
this building-- why pick it ?
you know , rossi , i think we need to get off
this whole moral enforcer theory .
how come ?
a moral enforcer or vigilante
would display his murders .
he &apos;d want to inspire fear .
this unsub is going in the other direction .
ted bundy , green river killer .
each kill was at separate times ,
but they both hoarded their victims in one spot .
mm . and in their cases , committed necrophilia .
that &apos;s not our unsub &apos;s m.o.
but revisiting could be .
so he puts them in a tank for safekeeping .
speaks to a certain level of organization .
only he doesn &apos;t think it through .
decomposition would clog the pipes .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they &apos;re found .
so , why this tank , pal ?
there &apos;s thousands of tanks in sacramento .
why this one ?
you know , there &apos;s one other thing
this guy shares with green river .
what &apos;s that ?
when washington state police found the first 5 victims
in roughly the same spot in the river ,
ridgway was forced to find a new disposal site .
our unsub will do the same .
hello ?
hello !
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t--you can &apos;t do this to me !
do you trust me ?
no ! no , no , no , no !
that &apos;s why i have to do this .
c.o.d. for debi leitelt was exsanguination .
jane doe died from sepsis .
both bodies tested positive for large amounts of opiates .
lab is still running a breakdown on the specifics .
debi &apos;s been clean for a couple of months ,
but given the statistics for relapse ,
it &apos;s quite possible she fell off the wagon .
or the unsub injected her himself .
am i reading this right ? two different blade types
were used on the victims &apos; faces ?
correct . the postmortem cuts are facial slashes
made by a precision blade , something like a scalpel .
a scalpel &apos;s an odd choice for disfigurement .
the antemortem wounds were made with a jagged tool ,
something with a serrated edge .
ok , so , two distinct tools for two distinct goals .
which are ?
unclear at this point . jane doe had hydrofluorocarbon
and dimethyl ether in her hair .
and titanium dioxide .
those first two are commonly found in aerosols .
titanium dioxide is a white pigment
found in a wide range of products .
like spray @-@ in hair color , blond to be exact .
that &apos;s my presumption , yes .
most of it washed out in the water ,
but there are still trace elements on her scalp .
someone who used this type of cheap hair color all the time
would be more skilled at applying it .
she wouldn &apos;t get it all over her scalp .
so the unsub did it .
assume these victims are both victims of opportunity .
high @-@ risk lifestyle , possibly prostitutes ,
definitely drug addicts .
we see this victimology all the time .
easier targets . it takes a while
before anyone notices they &apos;re missing .
right . that part he &apos;s smart enough to plan for .
if he wanted to kill them quickly , he could .
exactly . instead he spends time with them .
he puts each one through a unique ritual .
and he redresses one and he gives the other a sloppy dye job .
and then he tears their faces apart .
he remakes them so he can destroy them .
they &apos;re surrogates
for the woman who &apos;s the real object of his rage .
and his anger manifests itself as a sexual release ,
and when he &apos;s done , he wants to do it again .
gardener found her this morning .
noticed the jacuzzi lid askew and went to fix it .
any witnesses ?
no , neighbors didn &apos;t see anything .
well , we profiled he &apos;d find a new disposal site .
i just didn &apos;t think it &apos;d be this public .
what is it ?
oh , first a water tank , now a covered jacuzzi .
it &apos;s not just the water that &apos;s important to him .
he wants them enclosed ,
like a sarcophagus .
how long was she in the water ?
well , based on body temp ,
the m.e. thinks she died two days ago .
but based on when the family went to bed last night ,
she &apos;s only been in the water 6 hours .
a real blonde this time .
exact same dress as debi .
he &apos;s combining elements ,
turning the surrogates into the women he really wants to hurt .
jj , look .
it &apos;s a suture .
now , why would he leave that behind ?
he probably ran out of time .
that would explain the two different types of cuts .
one of them isn &apos;t a cut at all .
i don &apos;t follow .
ripping out sutures would leave a jagged edge ,
kind of like when you tear a shirt at its seams .
that &apos;s why it looked like the unsub was using a serrated knife .
he was actually trying to hide what he was doing .
and if he was sewing that in the face ,
then the postmortem slashing could be a forensic countermeasure
to hide the surgical component .
good timing , boy genius .
i have the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on our second victim .
the jane doe is belinda cameron .
she was brought up on shoplifting , solicitation charges ,
but she recently entered rehab
in an effort to turn her life around .
garcia , what about our most recent victim ?
is there anyone in the system
with a red rose tattoo on their left wrist ?
i &apos;m on it .
why , yes , there is .
leslie schellin .
she was nabbed on possession of a controlled substance .
and looky here . her current place of residence is changing lives .
it &apos;s a halfway house .
great . thanks , garcia .
well , it looks like rehab is the connection .
let &apos;s deliver the profile .
we believe the unsub we &apos;re looking for
is a white male in his late 20s to early 30s .
he is a surgical sadist , operating on women
he finds in and around the recovery community of oak park .
the fact that he &apos;s able to earn the trust
of the women in this victim pool leads us to believe
he may be a part of the recovery community himself .
so he &apos;s operating on these women just to kill them ?
death isn &apos;t the goal for this unsub , pain is .
he cuts these women to inflict
physical and psychological scars that won &apos;t heal .
so who is victim zero ?
that brings us to the other part of this unsub &apos;s psychology .
he &apos;s putting these victims through a transformation .
most likely before he starts cutting them .
he &apos;s dyeing their hair and changing their clothes .
we believe they &apos;re surrogates
for the woman he believes wronged him .
this woman might be a first victim we haven &apos;t found yet .
his anger toward her wasn &apos;t sated after hurting her .
we think this woman , victim zero , has had a personal connection
with this unsub , and finding her will be the key to stopping him .
thank you .
what ...
what did you do to me ?
now do you trust me ?
what did you do to me ?
what did you do to me ?
what did you do to me ?
what did you do to me ?
what is this ?
it &apos;s phase one .
maybe victim zero was a junkie who got clean
and rejected the unsub .
or maybe she fell off the wagon
and he was furious &apos; cause he worked to nurse her back to health .
or maybe she was abducted by aliens .
yeah , maybe .
ok , this ends now .
let me see .
oh , my goodness . what a cutie .
wait , is that ...
hayden montgomery .
ex @-@ wife number two .
a lot of water under that bridge between you two , huh ?
29 years worth .
too much to get past .
mm . is she unreasonable ?
no .
is she selfish ?
not in the slightest .
well , what was her reason for not telling you about joy ?
the job .
this job .
what ?
nothing .
jennifer , what ?
ok , look , i &apos;m--
i am on your side ,
but ... i get it .
because you &apos;re a mom .
no . because i know you , david rossi .
you told me what you were like back then .
nothing came between you and the job .
yeah--yeah , but i might have put it on hold
if it meant i got the chance to raise a daughter like joy .
well , yeah , it &apos;s easy to say that now
because you know who joy turned out to be .
but 30 years ago ,
would you have really put your career on hold
for diapers and teething and all @-@ night crying fits ?
look , hayden had to make a call ,
and maybe it was the wrong call ,
but don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t understand why she made it .
you know i say this out of love , right ?
yeah .
i do .
and thanks .
guys .
i have weird news and weirder news .
the m.e. just finished the breakdown of the drugs in our victims .
morphine and meperidine .
those are pain management drugs .
yeah , not exactly the street heroin they were trying to kick .
then this isn &apos;t about addiction .
this is about trying to make them feel better after he cuts them .
a sadist wouldn &apos;t do that .
well , that brings me to the weirder .
we found this in the right cheek of the third victim .
is that saline ?
yeah , some kind of improvised implant .
there were no implants found in the other victims .
he &apos;s devolving .
he &apos;s starting to get sloppy .
it looks like the edges of the plastic have been melted ,
like a vacuum sealer .
we got garcia on the case , but do the math .
pain medication plus implant-- gives you what ?
he thinks he &apos;s helping these women .
take these .
they &apos;ll make you feel better .
no . i &apos;m trying to kick .
it &apos;s necessary , i promise .
now drink .
are you ready for phase two ?
are you gonna keep hurting me ?
no . never .
look at me . never again .
never again .
it &apos;s ok , i &apos;m just ...
it &apos;s ok .
almost there .
you &apos;re beautiful , sarah .
it looks like the unsub attempted to cut flaps
in the right cheek and then sew them back together .
look at his work .
this is the kind of medical knowledge you get off the internet .
what &apos;s he trying to accomplish
by sewing the cheeks up improperly ?
he &apos;s choosing to distort his victims &apos; faces .
i thought you guys said he was trying to help .
he thinks he is .
ok , so , we know these women are surrogates for her .
we thought he was furious with them ,
but we now know that &apos;s wrong .
he &apos;s in love with her .
yeah .
now , the implant is much like the dress or the blond hair .
it &apos;s part of the transformation .
but implants are supposed to make you prettier .
he &apos;s making them uglier .
uglier according to conventional standards .
to him they &apos;re more beautiful .
somewhere is his love map
he obsessed over someone society didn &apos;t want to look at .
that &apos;s our victim zero .
he &apos;s doing all of this because he wants her back .
my name is danielle .
i &apos;m 90 days sober .
i got sober for my little brother .
i didn &apos;t want him to think i was someone
who wasn &apos;t going to be there for him . um ...
my--my brother &apos;s name is ian .
i &apos;m going to be at his graduation
and i &apos;m going to be clean for him .
i was gonna make up for all the times i wasn &apos;t there
because i was too messed up .
my name is danielle .
this isn &apos;t my dress .
this isn &apos;t my face .
please , my name is danielle !
this is ...
me .
what have you got , garcia ?
i got a hit on a danielle steinhardt .
she &apos;s been missing for the past two days .
does she fit his victimology ?
she &apos;s blond , and she &apos;s been living
at a treatment facility
in oak park for the past couple of months .
her brother reported her missing when she didn &apos;t check back in .
where are we on the medical conditions
that victim zero might have had ?
nothing yet . but if you direct me ,
i can be a much more effective missile .
well , this guy &apos;s trigger happened recently ,
so look for car accidents , overdoses , suicides .
we also think his ideal may have some sort of facial deformity .
uh , no , still looking .
a neurofibroma .
garcia , look up neurofibromatosis .
uh , how do you spell that ?
wait , never mind , auto correct has it .
neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder
that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue .
ok , garcia , look for women
with tumors embedded in the nerves on the right side of their face .
that &apos;s where all the implants have been .
ok , there &apos;s a rehabilitation center that specializes in that
at u.c. davis . it &apos;s not the rehab we &apos;ve been talking about .
it &apos;s the medical kind . ok .
i &apos;m gonna dig into this . i will hit you back
when i find a bone . ok ?
there &apos;s one last thing you need to see .
what &apos;s up , garcia ?
i sent a video to your tablets .
i give you sarah sherwood ,
28 , blonde , and the poor sweetheart
suffered from neurofibromatosis .
she drowned herself at her parents &apos; house 3 weeks ago .
roughly around the time the first victim would have gone missing .
she drowned herself in the worst way i can imagine .
her parents had a pool with a retractable tarp .
she held down the remote and she covered herself under it .
she would have locked herself in .
that explains why he chooses
enclosed bodies of water for his victims .
and puts them in the same dress she wore when she killed herself .
the only person who would know that
is the one who found the body .
garcia ?
yes , yes , sir , i am on that
like brown on super healthy rice .
that would be her boyfriend .
he goes by the name of joseph berzon .
according to police , he was inconsolable .
how is joseph connected to the other victims ?
he works for delivery dining .
they deliver to treatment centers and the sro
where the first two victims were found .
that &apos;s how he got access to the pain medication .
the worse the rehab center , the more lax they are with the drugs
and the easier they are to steal .
and according to their website ,
they seal the meals with a vacuum sealer .
garcia , where can we find joseph ?
i &apos;m sending you his work and home address .
what do you think ?
don &apos;t you like it , sarah ?
who &apos;s sarah ?
you are .
this is your room .
we decorated it together ,
for when you were ready to move in with me .
remember her ?
she &apos;s your favorite .
you always said she looked just like you .
maybe this will help you remember .
yes .
i remember .
you do ?
i do .
you ...
did all this for me .
i &apos;ll do anything for you .
anything ?
anything .
just tell me what you want .
let me go outside .
i can &apos;t .
after last time ?
i can &apos;t .
you have to understand .
i understand perfectly .
sarah !
help . help me .
help me .
oh , my god . are you-- what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
sarah , you can &apos;t be out of bed .
my wife just got out of the hospital .
but is she ok ?
it &apos;s just her medication . she &apos;ll be all right .
thank you . i &apos;m sorry we bothered you .
ok .
why would you do that ?
you &apos;re crazy .
i &apos;m crazy ?
did you see the way he looked at you ?
he was polite , but only because he had to be .
who else is going to love you the way i do ?
who , sarah ?
nobody .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s why we stay inside , forever .
hey , garcia , you &apos;re on speaker .
i &apos;ve got background on joseph berzon .
anything stand out ?
oh , yeah . when he was 11,
his mother was in a car accident
that completely mutilated her face .
she was then bedridden for 3 years
and then died as a result of her injury .
he had no other living family .
that event must have imprinted on him
and stayed with him all these years .
and after that , he was put in the foster care system ,
and then the group home he was in
was busted on abuse charges .
sounds like the kid went through
a lot of physical and emotional pain .
that &apos;s one hell of a stressor .
what shall we do tonight ?
something &apos;s wrong .
oh , no . no .
everything is exactly right .
look how pretty you are .
reid i and are nearly at berzon &apos;s work .
is there anything else , garcia ?
yeah . i just found some interesting emails
between sarah and her parents .
what are they about ?
a month ago , there was an incident at a park .
what kind of incident ?
well , sarah didn &apos;t go outside much ,
and according to one of these email exchanges ,
she was really embarrassed about the tumors on her face ,
but joseph encouraged her to give it a try .
that &apos;s when things got bad .
everyone is staring at me .
hey . i &apos;m here .
we can get through anything together .
do you trust me ?
i trust you , joseph .
oh . i left your favorite wine in the car .
leave it .
no . just give me a second . i &apos;ll be right back .
no . i --
he left her alone ...
and she had an anxiety attack .
two days later , he found her dead .
then this isn &apos;t just about recreating sarah ,
it &apos;s about rewriting the past .
he thinks he can get it right this time .
darling .
darling , get up , please .
please .
i &apos;m dying .
no , no , no . you &apos;re not dying .
no . no .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you &apos;re going to be all right .
everything is going to be all right . i &apos;ll save you .
fbi !
joseph berzon , step away from danielle .
no ! stay away !
joseph , look at her . she needs help .
i &apos;m the only one who can give it to her .
you don &apos;t understand her .
don &apos;t you love sarah ?
of course . how can you ask me that ?
then accept that she &apos;s gone , joseph .
all you &apos;re doing is hurting innocent women
who never wanted you to make this choice for them .
that &apos;s not sarah .
she never was .
do you trust me ?
i trust you , joseph .
joseph !
it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
you &apos;re gonna be ok .
i &apos;m danielle , right ?
yes . danielle .
my name is david .
thank you .
thank you .
&quot; since love grows within you ,
so beauty grows .
for love is the beauty of the soul . &quot;
saint augustine .
hey , shawn . it &apos;s me .
i &apos;ve got a quick question i want to ask you .
i -- i hope i didn &apos;t wake you .
shawn told me you were coming .
would you like to come in ?
no , i--i should be getting back .
for kai &apos;s sake , you wanted me to say what i needed to say ,
and i figured out what that is .
all right .
i can &apos;t wave a magic wand and change what happened .
but what i can do
is understand why you did it .
you were in the trenches ,
turning what i &apos;m sure was a handful of a little girl
into a confident , beautiful woman .
