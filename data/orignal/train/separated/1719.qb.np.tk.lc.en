we now pronounce you husband and wife !
i love this part !
me , too !
i have strongly mixed feelings !
so , howard &apos;s really in space , huh ?
mm @-@ hmm , international space station .
250 miles that way .
right now , howard &apos;s staring down at our planet
like a tiny jewish greek god .
zeusowitz .
i must admit ,
i can &apos;t help but feel a twinge of envy .
he can look out the window
and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes .
his dim , uncomprehending eyes .
it &apos;s like a cat in an airport carrying case .
you know , it &apos;s not exactly glamorous up there .
the water that the astronauts drink
is made from each other &apos;s recycled urine .
must be nice .
nobody wants anything that comes out of me .
i wonder what he &apos;s doing right this very second .
mm , conducting experiments in zero gravity .
peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos .
whatever it is , we know his life will never be the same .
howard ! can you hear me ? !
i can hear you without the phone !
don &apos;t be snippy .
i &apos;m just excited to talk to my baby !
i &apos;m excited to talk to you , too .
so , what &apos;s this mishegas about you moving out
to go live with the little polish girl ? !
how about calling her my wife ?
wives don &apos;t take boys from their mothers .
they do . that &apos;s why we marry them !
i just hope i &apos;m not dead from a broken heart
before you get back .
ma , please .
everyone from nasa is listening to this phone call .
good . they should know what a horrible son you are !
okay , ma , great talking to you ! gotta go !
well ... space is ruined .
this is so exciting .
soon , my upper lip will be the same fake blonde
as my beautiful best friend .
hey , this is my natural hair color .
now .
so , does sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night ?
oh , yes . according to the relationship agreement ,
on the anniversary of our first date ,
he must take me to a nice dinner ,
ask about my day
and engage in casual physical contact
that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy .
that &apos;s hot .
you kids better use protection .
how long does this stay on ?
just a couple of minutes .
you &apos;ve really never done this before ?
once in high school , but i dozed off
and woke up with second @-@ degree chemical burns on my face .
oh , my gosh , that &apos;s awful .
the other kids make fun of you ?
no , i had a cover story ;
i told everyone it was herpes .
so , how &apos;s everything going with you and leonard ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s still kind of weird .
we haven &apos;t really recovered since he proposed to me
in the middle of sex .
oh . boo @-@ hoo .
if sheldon proposed to me during sex ,
my ovaries would grab on to him
and never let go .
leonard , where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
interesting question .
on the one hand , i always thought ...
you don &apos;t even know what it is , do you ?
the anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does ,
the answer is that it must have qualities
that allow intelligent creatures to arise
who are capable of asking the question .
as i am doing so eloquently right now .
i know what the anthropic principle is .
of course . i just explained it to you .
now , where do you stand on it ?
where do you stand on it ?
strongly pro .
then i believe that god created the world in six days ,
and on the seventh , he made you to annoy me .
hey , guys .
yeah , wait , raj ,
where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
i &apos;m all for it .
attaboy !
well , hang on . why do you believe
that he knows what it is and i don &apos;t ?
oh , leonard . let &apos;s not take a saw
to the branch we &apos;re sitting on , shall we ?
hey , uh , if you guys are free tonight ,
i heard about a spa where you soak your feet
in a pool full of little fish
that eat all the dead skin right off them .
i don &apos;t need to tell you , in los angeles ,
sandal season is year round .
actually , i &apos;m hanging out with penny .
oh , okay .
sounds like it &apos;s me and you , sheldon .
how about we sic some guppies on those puppies ?
as i &apos;ve stated before on numerous occasions ,
the only sea creature i would even consider being eaten by
is the kraken ,
because the last words i would hear are :
&quot; release the kraken . &quot;
that never gets old .
&quot; release the kraken ! &quot;
oh , chills .
besides , i &apos;m having dinner with amy .
oh , okay . i &apos;ll just go home and be alone .
w @-@ which is cool .
i eat alone , i sleep alone , i cry alone , so ...
cool .
darn .
if you weren &apos;t busy , i &apos;d ask you to join us .
really ? i can come ? thanks !
sheldon , are you sure you want to be bringing raj
on your date night with amy ?
oh , absolutely .
i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation
and casual physical contact ,
but nowhere is it specified
that i can &apos;t outsource that to an indian .
howie ?
howie ?
hey , there &apos;s my beautiful bride !
can you see me ?
i can . how are you ?
i &apos;m amazing .
i mean , this is even better than i dreamed .
i look out the window , and ... it &apos;s all so unbelievable .
good for you .
i just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom .
oh , yeah ? that &apos;s nice .
it was . until i found out you never told her
we &apos;re not gonna live with her .
let &apos;s talk about that for a minute .
hey , look , this pen is floating .
how crazy is that ?
you said you told her , but you never did !
okay , okay , i know you &apos;re upset , but ...
let me share something i &apos;ve learned since i got here .
you realize how small your problems are
when you &apos;re looking down on them from space .
now , come on , that &apos;s got to make you feel better .
how clear is the image of me on that screen ?
pretty clear .
do i look like i feel better ?
i mean , it &apos;s not , like , hd quality .
listen , mister , you &apos;re gonna talk to your mother
and you &apos;re gonna fix this , or that thing i said
i was gonna do to you the minute you got home ,
you can do to yourself .
like he &apos;s been doing since he got here .
sheldon , this place is so romantic .
oh , i &apos;m glad you like it .
raj picked it out .
well , when you see him , tell him i say thank you .
tell him yourself .
over here !
i don &apos;t understand . what &apos;s he doing here ?
i invited him .
on our date ?
sheldon , that &apos;s not okay .
yes , it is .
there &apos;s a loophole in the relationship agreement .
you found a loophole ?
sorry i started without you . i &apos;m a little nervous .
it &apos;s been a long time since i &apos;ve been on a date .
i can &apos;t believe i bleached my mustache for this .
you should go to my girl .
she &apos;ll knock out those sideburns for free .
you know , amy , i don &apos;t even think
you and i have had a real conversation .
let &apos;s use tonight to get to know each other a little better .
you start .
go home .
i don &apos;t understand .
sheldon , how could you do this ?
it &apos;s our second anniversary .
it &apos;s your anniversary ? !
oh , my god , i had no idea .
amy , please , let me make this right .
thank you .
my pleasure . waiter ?
a bottle of champagne and three glasses .
oh , boy , isn &apos;t this romantic ?
oh , i hope that &apos;s a rhetorical question ,
because i have no clue .
this is great . what &apos;s the occasion ?
no occasion .
you know , things have been a little weird between us ,
so i wanted to throw together a fun night just for you .
that is so sweet .
i got all your favorites .
beer , wings , sliders .
we can watch the football game .
i even painted my stomach .
&quot; go sports &quot; ?
in case you were in the mood for baseball ,
i didn &apos;t want to look ridiculous .
this is awesome . i love it !
good , i &apos;m glad .
gosh , i worked my ass off today .
this is exactly what i needed .
great . just relax and enjoy .
tonight is all about you .
ah , thank you !
so , where exactly are we in this relationship ?
oh , come on !
i just told you i had a hard day .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s watch the game .
great .
i just know the longer we wait to talk about it , the weirder it gets .
sweetie , can i just be the girl tonight ?
absolutely . you &apos;re the girl , i &apos;m the guy .
now , you watch your football game
while i make you a little plate here .
thank you !
oh , i &apos;ll get it .
go sports !
hello @-@ lo @-@ lo .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you were out th sheldon and amy .
i was , but it &apos;s their anniversary
and i didn &apos;t want to be a third wheel ,
so i figured i &apos;d come over here
and hang out with you and penny on your date .
well , it &apos;s not really a great time .
penny and i have some things we need to talk about .
no , we don &apos;t ! come on in !
sweet !
i can &apos;t believe i shaved my stomach for this .
hey , froot loops .
you got a phone call .
who is it ?
a woman who says she &apos;s your mother
but sounds like your father .
hey , ma .
you know , we could see each other
if you turn on the computer .
i &apos;m not going near that fakakta thing .
i &apos;ll catch a computer virus !
you can &apos;t catch a computer virus .
oh , so now you &apos;re an astronaut and a doctor ?
what do you want , ma ?
your wife says you have something important to tell me .
okay , here it is .
bernadette and i are starting a life together and ...
oh , god ! you are gonna leave me !
ma ...
it &apos;s okay .
your father left me , you left me--
i guess i &apos;m just the kind of person people like to leave .
it &apos;s not ... definite .
i &apos;ll talk to bernadette .
don &apos;t bother .
i &apos;ll just go sit in a hole in the ground
so i &apos;m no trouble when i die .
stop it , ma .
i &apos;m sure i can get bernie to come around .
i knew it !
i knew she was behind this !
you listen to me , if you want to be a man ,
you can &apos;t let a woman tell you what to do !
okay , okay .
i can &apos;t believe these people won the cold war .
now , can we please change the subject ?
fine .
explain why you &apos;ve been gone so long
and i haven &apos;t gotten a single letter .
not even a lousy postcard !
you know , i &apos;m growing to like american football .
yeah , it &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t it ?
well ... it &apos;s not the balls @-@ to @-@ the @-@ wall action of badminton or cricket ,
but hey ...
what is ?
all right , who &apos;s ready for another beer ?
i &apos;m good .
no , thank you .
girls .
i am having the nicest time .
you guys are like family to me .
you know that , right ?
that &apos;s great . get out .
what ? why ?
penny and i have some issues we need to talk about .
pish on your issues !
you guys are fine .
yes , you hit some bumps along the way .
i mean , penny ,
you &apos;ve always known how this man has felt about you ,
but you made him grovel for affection .
okay , hold on ...
now , don &apos;t blame yourself .
he was a groveler from way back .
but the point is , the two of you got past it .
and , leonard , you go and propose
to this poor girl in the middle of sex ?
that was some weak tea , dude .
some people might say it was romantic .
yeah , no .
but yet , here you two are , still together .
and that &apos;s even after you and i had our crazy naked night .
okay ... that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m just saying
that after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
you get to look into each other &apos;s eyes
and say &quot; i love you . &quot;
and that &apos;s beautiful .
actually , to this day , she &apos;s never really said it .
oh , penny ! that &apos;s ridiculous !
you know you love him !
you look him in the eyes and you say it .
raj ...
oh , come on ,
you know you want to say it . say it .
say you love him .
say it !
i really thought she would say it .
have i ever told you you &apos;re like a sexy praying mantis ?
every time you drink alcohol .
you know what &apos;s wonderful about the praying mantis ?
they devour their mate .
your point being ?
dessert is served .
i just had cobbler .
you know what ?
i &apos;m done with this .
w @-@ where are you going ?
i &apos;m leaving .
you can &apos;t leave .
i need you .
you do ?
yes .
you &apos;re my ride .
sheldon , you either say something meaningful
and from the heart , or you and i are done .
all right .
please .
amy ...
when i look in your eyes
and you &apos;re looking back in mine ,
everything feels not quite normal ,
because i feel
stronger and weaker at the same time .
i feel excited and , at the same time , terrified .
the truth is ,
i don &apos;t know what i feel , except ...
i know what kind of man i want to be .
sheldon ...
that was beautiful .
i should hope so .
that &apos;s from the first spider @-@ man movie .
i &apos;ll take it .
good .
now , i assume we &apos;re splitting the check ?
hey , stuart .
oh , hey . i was actually just about to close up .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll leave .
no , no . it &apos;s okay . hang out .
you sure ?
yeah , you &apos;re my first customer today .
all right . great .
i &apos;m , uh , having a nightcap .
you want to join me ?
what are you drinking ?
coffee liqueur in a chewbacca mug .
i call it a sad @-@ tini .
perfect for the night i &apos;m having . thank you .
hmm . nice not to drink alone .
amen to that .
sometimes i pour
a little chardonnay into my dog &apos;s water bowl .
you &apos;re kidding .
she &apos;s kind of a mean drunk , but what are you gonna do ?
cheers .
cheers .
a little music ?
sure .
bossa nova .
you listen to that with your hips as well as your ears .
mmm .
something about ...
latin music just makes me feel like
i &apos;m on a white sand beach in rio .
yeah .
the sun , the waves , the beautiful bodies ,
tanned and glistening with sweat .
i should go .
yeah .
uh , thank you for the drink .
no problem .
hey , stuart .
yeah ?
do you want to ... hang out tomorrow night ,
maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie ?
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;d like to , but i &apos;m a little tight on funds .
no problem . my treat .
i &apos;ll swing by after work .
okay .
okay .
i could do worse .
aw , that &apos;s such good news , howie .
thank you for telling her .
hey , i &apos;m a grown man ; i &apos;m gonna live with my wife .
my mother &apos;s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own .
was she upset ?
who can tell ? she yells everything .
she might have been upset .
she might have been hungry .
thanks for fixing it .
i love you .
i love you , too .
sweet dreams . i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow ?
good night , rocket man .
