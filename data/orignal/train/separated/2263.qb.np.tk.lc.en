gold--he says there &apos;s a way to stop cora .
it &apos;s the ink . there &apos;s a jar of it in his cell ,
where we kept him .
what happened ?
david--he went under a sleeping spell . now he &apos;s trapped .
we destroyed the wardrobe .
cora gathered the ashes .
she &apos;s gonna use them to open up a portal .
there &apos;s an enchanted compass . cora seeks it .
the compass is in your hand . why do this to me now ?
you took a heart .
and now you have a princess .
cora didn &apos;t see me escape .
how did you escape ?
hook--he said that if you had trusted him ...
you could &apos;ve defeated cora together .
can we get on with the business of going to storybrooke ?
all we need is the compass .
halt .
food for the prisoner .
it &apos;s not mealtime . who are you ?
identify yourself , slave .
&quot; slave &quot; ?
i prefer &quot; captain . &quot;
hi . you must be belle .
the queen sent you , didn &apos;t she ?
she wants you to kill me .
i &apos;m not here to kill you , love .
i &apos;m here to rescue you .
rescue me ? who are you ?
a friend .
we haven &apos;t much time .
your father &apos;s life is in danger .
he &apos;s being attacked by the very same monster
who stole you away from your family in the first place .
what , rumplestiltskin ?
the dark one-- he must be stopped .
you spent more time with him than anyone .
there are rumors of a magical weapon
that has the power to kill him .
no . no . no . no . let--let me talk to him .
he &apos;s not a monster .
belle , your father &apos;s life hangs in the balance .
i need to know what that weapon is and where to find it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
and i have no idea how to-- how to kill rumplestiltskin .
you don &apos;t ?
no . and--and nor would i.
then i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not here to rescue you .
so pretty ...
yet so useless .
no . not useless .
she &apos;s a valuable chess piece .
do i look like i &apos;m playing a game of chess ?
my hook , if you please .
no .
the asking was me being a gentleman .
is that any way to address a queen ?
even a pirate should have better manners than that .
yes .
i know who you are ...
captain .
i know why you came here from neverland ,
and i know all about the crocodile you wish to skin .
then you also know that i &apos;ll stop at nothing .
so dedicated and resourceful .
no one has been able to fight their way
past my defenses before .
she can &apos;t help you kill rumplestiltskin , hook ...
but i can ,
if you do something for me .
care to join me for a drink ?
things are about to change in this world .
radically .
i have plans to enact a curse
that will take everyone to a far @-@ off land .
how will that help me ?
this new realm ?
it &apos;s a land without magic ,
where the dark one will be stripped of his powers .
there you won &apos;t need any magical weapon to kill him .
you can do it
with a mere flick of your wrist .
tell me what i have to do .
there &apos;s one person i don &apos;t want following me to this new land .
you &apos;re to see to it that doesn &apos;t happen .
an assassination .
who is it you want me to dispose of ?
my mother .
any change ?
no .
he &apos;s not improving .
he needs true love &apos;s kiss .
he won &apos;t wake up until mary margaret comes back .
until ?
well , that &apos;s rather optimistic , isn &apos;t it ?
what are you talking about ?
they &apos;re up against your mother .
the only chance snow and emma have of defeating her
is with the squid ink .
which is why you sent the message through david .
which would be beneficial
if we knew that message were delivered .
but alas , given the prince &apos;s condition , we don &apos;t know .
as such , it &apos;s important we take precautions .
we have to consider the possibility
that when that portal opens ,
it won &apos;t be his family that come through .
it &apos;ll be cora .
and neither one of us wants that .
we have to find where they &apos;re coming through
and destroy that portal .
but whoever came through would die .
exactly . but i &apos;m confident between the two of us ,
we can summon up enough magic to complete the task .
well , what if we &apos;re wrong ?
what if that portal opens up , and it &apos;s not my mother ?
what if mary margaret and emma do defeat cora
and go through it ?
well , i believe in this world , they call that a win @-@ win .
how exactly is that ?
if we stop cora ,
you are protected from your mother &apos;s wrath .
if , on the other hand , we stop snow and emma ,
well ...
you become the only mother in your son &apos;s life ,
now don &apos;t you ?
look , magic is unpredictable in this world .
if something unfortunate were to happen
while you were attempting to help ...
henry could hardly blame you for that , could he ?
no .
i can &apos;t lie to him .
i am trying to be a better mother .
you won &apos;t be able to be a better anything
if cora comes through .
and if she does ,
she will be a threat to everyone ,
including your son .
so if you truly want to be a good mother to henry ,
to protect him .
if you want to be better ,
prove it .
rumplestiltskin &apos;s cell .
i haven &apos;t been here since before regina &apos;s curse .
this is where he told us you were going to be the savior .
he knew ?
oh , it was prophesized .
come on .
the squid ink-- it &apos;s not here .
gold said we would find it .
well , was there anyone else in here with him ?
could they have taken the ink ?
no , he was kept alone .
visitors were forbidden . he was too dangerous
to allow any human contact .
how &apos;d he keep from going crazy ?
he didn &apos;t .
what is it ?
is that a message ?
yes .
and i think it &apos;s for you .
why would you think ...
that ?
&quot; with one kiss ,
true love &apos;s power made everything right again .
but this was not the end of their story .
it was just the beginning . &quot;
i think this time it &apos;ll happen the other way around .
you think so ?
i do .
which is why i need you to stay here
and watch david for a little while .
where are you going ?
mr. gold and i need to prepare
for emma and mary margaret &apos;s return .
coming through the portal won &apos;t be easy .
we need to make sure everything &apos;s in place .
really ? you &apos;re really gonna help them ?
i promised you i was going to do better ,
to be better .
so yes .
i &apos;m going to do everything in my power
to see to it they come home safely .
you really have changed .
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
i &apos;m really glad you , uh ,
came to your senses .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
it &apos;s right through here .
ah , yes .
should suit our purposes , no ?
how much do we need ?
all of it .
how are we going to do that ?
with a little help from a fairy .
dead one .
believe me ,
no one mourns her .
it &apos;s now ...
enchanted .
it will enable you to rip out her heart .
i believe you &apos;ve seen it done before .
yes .
the enchantment will only allow you to rip out one heart ,
so make sure you do it right .
what could she have possibly done to warrant such brutality ?
that &apos;s my business .
yours is to kill her and bring her body back to me .
easy enough .
when will i set forth on this murderous journey ?
immediately .
but you won &apos;t be going alone .
you remember claude .
can &apos;t say that i do .
you killed him in the cell block .
ah , yes .
i didn &apos;t recognize him without my hook in his neck .
forgive me , but isn &apos;t he a bit of dead weight ?
i banished my mother
to a far @-@ off land some time ago .
you &apos;re gonna need a portal to get to her .
the rules are simple .
one goes in , one comes back .
or in this case , two in , two back .
you &apos;ll arrive with claude ,
and you &apos;ll return with my mother .
now tell me ...
which far @-@ off land do i have the pleasure of visiting today ?
wonderland .
happily named , i &apos;m sure .
how will i find her ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll find you .
kneel ... before the queen of hearts .
appreciate the warm welcome .
why has he come to wonderland ?
the queen wants to know why you &apos;ve come to wonderland .
i &apos;m in search of someone .
in her native land , she goes by &quot; cora . &quot;
in this land , she goes by &quot; your majesty . &quot;
leave us .
your name , pirate ?
hook .
what a clever nickname .
i come bearing gifts , if you allow me .
this hat ,
your portal ...
if i understand correctly ,
the same number who travels through must also return .
you arrived with him ,
but who shall you return with ?
you .
what ?
i &apos;m the queen of hearts .
do you really think i &apos;d be so careless
as to keep my heart where everyone else does ?
this ...
is how it &apos;s done .
tell me , who did this ?
who sent you here to kill me ?
who ?
your daughter .
regina ?
she ...
wants me dead ?
you &apos;re now going to tell me everything
and do exactly what i want .
because when you hold a heart ,
you control it .
you have the power .
what does this even mean ?
he was obsessed with you , emma .
you were the key to breaking the curse .
we &apos;ve looked everywhere . there &apos;s no ink in this cell .
well , it has to be . he told david .
you were in a netherworld .
maybe something got lost in translation .
no .
she heard right .
you found it ?
in a manner of speaking ,
there was ink in the cell .
son of a bitch .
aurora , what are you doing ? !
no .
helping me .
no .
no .
don &apos;t waste your energy , dear .
rumplestiltskin himself couldn &apos;t escape from this cell .
thank you , aurora . we couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
why would you do this ?
how could you ?
don &apos;t blame her .
she was only doing what she was told .
you took her heart ?
actually , i did .
it was a gift .
forgive us . we &apos;d love to stay ,
but storybrooke awaits .
hook .
wait .
please don &apos;t do this .
my son is in storybrooke . he needs me .
perhaps you should &apos;ve considered that
before you abandoned me on that beanstalk .
you would &apos;ve done the same .
actually , no .
do you know what this is , emma ?
the bean that the giant kept .
yes , indeed .
a pirate always keeps a souvenir of his conquest ,
but this ...
well , this is much more than a mere trinket .
this is a symbol--
something that was once magical , full of hope ,
possibility .
now look at it .
dried up , dead , useless .
much like you .
the time for making deals is done ,
just as i &apos;m done ...
with you .
leroy ! what is it ? what &apos;s the emergency ?
leroy .
they &apos;re gone .
they &apos;re all gone .
&quot; and yes , she was beyond hope ,
beyond saving .
this was her end . &quot;
where are they-- regina and gold ?
what &apos;s going on ?
all the magic has been drained from the mines .
they stole it ?
they snuck in after our shift
and took everything .
nobody steals from a dwarf .
except the queen .
and rumplestiltskin .
if they &apos;re not helping emma and mary margaret , that ...
that means my mom lied to me .
i &apos;m sorry , henry .
we need to find her . we need to stop them .
we need to help emma and mary margaret .
we aren &apos;t going to break it down , emma .
it was enchanted to hold rumplestiltskin .
we don &apos;t have a chance .
this is my fault .
no , it &apos;s mine .
cora stole your heart because i failed to protect you .
that &apos;s very sweet ,
but i believe it &apos;s my fault .
i &apos;m the savior
and i &apos;m not doing much saving , am i ?
we &apos;re going to win this fight , you know .
good always defeats evil .
you sound like henry .
guess optimism runs in the family .
i think it skipped a generation .
you should know better than anybody .
you broke the curse .
what have i done since then ?
i got us stranded over here , burned down the wardrobe ,
let cora get the ash and now the compass .
the only reason i ever broke the curse
was because it was exactly what gold wanted me to do .
i had nothing to do with it .
what are you talking about ?
he told you i was the savior . it was his plan .
once i fulfilled that role ,
maybe that &apos;s all i was ever meant to do .
everything i &apos;ve ever done--
he had it all mapped out before i was even born .
i &apos;m not powerful . i &apos;m--i &apos;m not ...
a savior .
i &apos;m a name on a piece of paper .
i &apos;m a pawn , and that &apos;s exactly why we are in here ...
and cora &apos;s on her way to storybrooke .
where are we going ?
lake nostos .
the legend says its waters hold the power
to restore what was once lost .
it &apos;ll return magic to what remains of this wardrobe .
and then ...
we &apos;ll be able to cross worlds .
i may be a simple pirate , but i know one thing .
lakes have water .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
why do you still doubt me ?
i &apos;ve told you all i know .
now have some honor and kill me .
honor ?
for the pirate who snuck into my palace
to assassinate me ?
at your daughter &apos;s behest .
she should &apos;ve come .
she should &apos;ve killed me herself .
mercy seems a bit out of character .
oh , not mercy , hook .
you &apos;re going to help me .
regina knows my methods better than anyone .
if i was controlling you , she &apos;d know .
this has to be your choice .
why should i ?
because , my dear , i &apos;m the only one
who can give you what you want .
is that so ?
this curse my daughter plans to enact ,
this new land she &apos;s taking everyone to--
you won &apos;t remember who you are .
so tell me , captain ,
how do you expect to kill someone
when you can &apos;t even remember him ?
but if you do what i say ,
i &apos;ll make sure you not only kill him ,
but that you remember every single moment .
well , what shall you have me do ?
get me close to my daughter ,
and then i &apos;ll rip her heart out .
satisfied ?
did she put up a fight ?
nothing i couldn &apos;t handle .
thank you .
now leave us .
i &apos;d like a moment alone to say good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m sorry , mother .
without you , i never would &apos;ve become the person i am now .
but i had no choice .
i had to do this .
after you killed daniel ,
you told me something i &apos;ve never forgotten .
love is weakness .
well , mother , you are my weakness
because i love you .
that &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t risk
taking you to the new land with me .
your grip on my heart is just too strong .
and for what i need to do ...
i can &apos;t have any weakness .
good @-@ bye , mother .
what happened ? you didn &apos;t kill her .
there &apos;s been a change in plans .
what would that be ?
my daughter &apos;s curse is coming .
we have to protect ourselves .
wouldn &apos;t it have been easier to reconcile with her
before her curse destroys the land ?
regina doesn &apos;t need me--
not now ,
not when she thinks she &apos;s about to win .
but i still have a place in her heart .
and the curse won &apos;t last forever . it will end .
in 28 years , there &apos;ll be a savior ,
and she &apos;ll break it .
28 years ?
you won &apos;t even notice .
you &apos;ll be frozen , like all those in this corner of the land .
but when the curse ends ,
and our quest will resume ,
and when it does ,
regina will truly have lost everything ,
and then she &apos;ll need me .
that &apos;s when we &apos;ll go to this new land .
you &apos;ll get your revenge .
and me , i &apos;ll ...
help her pick up the pieces .
you &apos;re certain the portal &apos;s going to open up all the way out here ?
there .
this is where things once lost are returned to us .
this is where cora &apos;s gonna come through .
unless it &apos;s mary margaret and emma ...
i highly doubt that .
we are going to get out of here .
how ? by staring at that scroll ?
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s gonna magically open the door for us .
yes , it is .
what ?
when i was a little girl , i used to sneak into cora &apos;s chamber
and watch her practice magic .
she had a spell book , and , emma ,
the spells were in the book .
yeah . isn &apos;t that what a spell book is a book that has spells in it ?
watch .
squid ink .
gold wrote the scroll in squid ink .
told ya .
good always wins .
wait . i can &apos;t go . you have to tie me up .
no . i &apos;m not leaving without you .
i can &apos;t be trusted , not as long as cora has my heart .
then i will get it back for you .
mulan .
i will .
mulan ...
we gotta go .
do it .
good luck .
thank you .
good luck to you .
and now the ashes .
would you care to do the honors ?
here we go .
we &apos;ll be in storybrooke soon enough .
i really look forward to seeing my daughter .
it &apos;s time .
so what are we waiting for ?
doesn &apos;t matter who comes through now .
no one can survive this .
i told you i &apos;d deliver you to rumplestiltskin .
now don &apos;t let go ,
unless you want to end up
someplace that isn &apos;t storybrooke .
you &apos;re not going anywhere ! this portal &apos;s taking us home !
the compass--get it .
find it first . i &apos;ll take care of them .
i may be a pirate ,
but i bristle at the thought of a woman losing her heart ,
unless it &apos;s over me .
go !
no , but you need the compass .
and aurora needs her heart .
take it .
it deflects her magic .
i had no idea you had such a soft side .
i don &apos;t . just like a fair fight .
good form . but not good enough .
normally ,
i prefer to do other more enjoyable activities
with a woman on her back .
with my life on the line , you &apos;ve left me no choice .
a bit of advice ?
when i jab you with my sword , you &apos;ll feel it .
you might want to quit .
why would i do that when i &apos;m winning ?
thanks .
now let &apos;s go home !
mom ?
you &apos;re not helping emma and mary margaret , are you ?
i &apos;m helping you , henry .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re gonna kill them .
sorry , dearie .
mom , what are you doing ?
we can &apos;t let cora come through the portal .
you have no idea what she would do to us .
emma and mary margaret are going to defeat her .
they &apos;re the ones that are gonna come through .
henry , your mother &apos;s right . it &apos;s gonna be cora .
no . it won &apos;t .
good always defeats evil .
you should know that more than anyone .
what i know is my mother will destroy
everything i love ,
and that means you ,
and i can &apos;t let that happen .
emma , run !
why do you want to go to storybrooke ?
because my daughter needs me .
the one thing she &apos;s always wanted--
your heart .
good @-@ bye , snow .
no ! emma !
oh , you foolish girl .
don &apos;t you know ?
love is weakness .
no .
it &apos;s strength .
what was that ?
that is a great subject for discussion ...
when we get home .
you ready ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go .
you can &apos;t ! stop it !
you can &apos;t !
you &apos;re gonna kill them !
please !
no !
they &apos;re going to make it through !
we have to turn it off !
you &apos;re gonna kill them !
oh ! henry !
what are you doing ?
emma and mary margaret are going to come through .
i know it .
you said you wanted to change ,
to be better .
this is how .
you want me to have faith in you ?
have faith in me
regina .
no !
i &apos;m sorry , henry ,
i &apos;m sorry .
mom ?
henry !
mom !
oh ! i missed you !
i missed you , too .
i missed you so much .
what &apos;s going on ?
what happened ?
she saved you . she saved both of you .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
are you okay ?
where &apos;s my husband ?
i need to find him .
um , your mom--
she &apos;s , uh ...
she &apos;s ...
a piece of work , you know ?
indeed i do .
welcome back .
thanks .
david !
you ...
you did it .
did you ever doubt i would ?
no .
though the burning red room did give me pause .
we need to talk .
yes .
i believe apologies are in order .
no .
no apologies necessary .
i understand why you wanted to keep cora out of here .
just remind me never to bet against you in the future ,
ms. swan .
it &apos;s not really a bet when the game is rigged , is it ?
to what exactly are you referring ?
your scroll .
i saw it in your cell .
you wrote my name again and again and again .
just wanted to make sure it would stick .
the ink--it was there all the time .
you could &apos;ve gotten out .
i was exactly where i wanted to be .
you needed to find that so all this could occur .
you created the curse , gold .
you made me the savior .
so everything i &apos;ve ever done ...
it &apos;s exactly what you wanted me to do .
i created the curse , dearie , but i didn &apos;t make you .
i merely took advantage of what you are--
the product of true love .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re powerful .
and everything you &apos;ve done ,
you &apos;ve done yourself .
so you don &apos;t know .
know what ?
cora ... tried to rip my heart out ,
but she couldn &apos;t .
she was blasted back by something inside me ,
by ...
by ...
by magic .
whatever that was , i didn &apos;t do that .
you did .
have you done this before ?
no .
thank you .
what now ?
cora told me something .
when a wraith consumes a soul ,
it &apos;s not trapped there forever .
it can be reunited with its body .
you think we can save phillip ?
we can try .
then let &apos;s try .
we failed .
really , cora ,
after all this time , why do you still doubt me ?
that bean &apos;s petrified . it &apos;s useless .
but these waters have regenerative properties .
perhaps it &apos;s time to do some gardening .
i was right .
you really have changed .
thank you .
emma .
emma .
looks like we have some catching up to do .
you have no idea .
how about dinner at granny &apos;s ? on me .
as long as it &apos;s not chimera , i &apos;m in .
hey , kid . you hungry ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll see you later .
congratulations .
you just reunited mother and son .
maybe one day ,
they &apos;ll even invite you for dinner .
there it is .
