there &apos;s nothing to tell !
he &apos;s just some guy i work with !
c &apos;mon , you &apos;re going out with the guy !
there &apos;s gotta be something wrong with him !
all right , joey . be nice .
so does he have a hump ? a hump and a hairpiece ?
wait , does he eat chalk ?
just , &apos; cause , i don &apos;t want her to go through
what i went through with carl
okay , everybody relax . this is not even a date .
it &apos;s just two people going out to dinner
and not having sex .
sounds like a date to me .
alright , so i &apos;m back in high school ,
i &apos;m standing in the middle of the cafeteria
and i realize i am totally naked .
oh , yeah . had that dream .
then i look down , and i realize there &apos;s a phone
there .
instead of ... ?
that &apos;s right .
never had that dream .
no .
all of a sudden , the phone starts to ring .
what do i do ? everyone starts looking at me .
they weren &apos;t looking at you before ?
finally , i figure i &apos;d better answer it .
and it turns out it &apos;s my mother ,
which is very @-@ very weird because-
she never calls me !
hi .
this guy says hello , i wanna kill myself .
are you okay , sweetie ?
i just feel like someone reached down my throat
grabbed my small intestine ,
pulled it out of my mouth
and tied it around my neck ...
cookie ?
carol moved her stuff out today
let me get you some coffee .
thanks .
no , no don &apos;t ! stop cleansing my aura !
no , just leave my aura alone , okay ?
i &apos;ll be fine , alright ?
really , everyone . i hope she &apos;ll be very happy .
no you don &apos;t .
no i don &apos;t ,
to hell with her , she left me !
and you never knew she was a lesbian ...
no ! ! okay ? !
why does everyone keep fixating on that ?
she didn &apos;t know , how should i know ?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian ...
did i say that out loud ?
i told mom and dad last night . they took it pretty well .
oh , really ?
so that hysterical phone call i got
from a woman at sobbing 3 : 00 a.m. ,
&quot; i &apos;ll never have grandchildren , i &apos;ll never have grandchildren . &quot;
was what ? a wrong number ?
sorry .
alright ross , look .
you &apos;re feeling a lot of pain right now .
you &apos;re angry . you &apos;re hurting .
can i tell you what the answer is ?
strip joint !
c &apos;mon , you &apos;re single ! have some hormones !
i don &apos;t want to be single , okay ?
i just ... i just wanna be married again !
and i just want a million dollars !
rachel ? !
oh , god , monica , hi ! thank god !
i just went to your building and you weren &apos;t there
and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here
and you are , you are !
can i get you some coffee ?
de @-@ caff
okay , everybody , this is rachel ,
another lincoln high survivor .
this is everybody , this is chandler ,
and phoebe , and joey ,
and you remember my brother ross ?
hi , sure !
hi .
so you wanna tell us now
or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids ?
oh , god ... well ,
it started about a half hour before the wedding .
i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents ,
and i was looking at this gravy boat .
this really gorgeous limoges gravy boat .
when all of a sudden
sweet &apos; n &apos; lo ?
i realized that i was more turned on
by this gravy boat than by barry !
and then i got really freaked out ,
and that &apos;s when it hit me :
how much barry looks like mr. potato head .
y &apos;know , i mean , i always knew looked familiar ,
but ...
anyway , i just had to get out of there ,
and i started wondering
&quot; why am i doing this , and who am i doing this for ? &quot;
so anyway i just didn &apos;t know where to go ,
and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart ,
but you &apos;re the only person i knew
who lived here in the city .
who wasn &apos;t invited to the wedding .
ooh , i was kinda hoping that wouldn &apos;t be an issue ...
now i &apos;m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ ,
and she &apos;s really not happy about it .
&quot; tuna or egg salad ! decide ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll have whatever christina &apos;s having . &quot;
daddy , i just ... i can &apos;t marry him !
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t love him .
well , it matters to me !
&quot; if i let go of my hair , my head will fall off . &quot;
ooh , she should not be wearing those pants .
i say push her down the stairs .
push her down the stairs ! push her down the stairs ! push her down the stairs !
c &apos;mon daddy , listen to me !
it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , all of my life ,
everyone has always told me , &apos; you &apos;re a shoe !
you &apos;re a shoe , you &apos;re a shoe , you &apos;re a shoe ! &apos; .
and today i just stopped and i said ,
&apos;what if i don &apos;t wanna be a shoe ?
what if i wanna be a- a purse , y &apos;know ? or a- or a hat !
no , i &apos;m not saying i want you to buy me a hat ,
i &apos;m saying i am a ha-
it &apos;s a metaphor , daddy !
you can see where he &apos;d have trouble .
look daddy , it &apos;s my life .
well maybe i &apos;ll just stay here with monica .
well , i guess we &apos;ve established who &apos;s staying here with monica ...
well , maybe that &apos;s my decision .
well , maybe i don &apos;t need your money .
wait ! ! wait , i said maybe ! !
just breathe , breathe ... that &apos;s it .
just try to think of nice calm things ...
rain drops on roses and rabbits and kittens
bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens ...
la la la something and noodles with string .
these are a few ...
i &apos;m all better now .
i helped !
okay , look , this is probably for the best , y &apos;know ?
independence . taking control of your life .
the whole hat thing .
and hey , you need anything , you can always come to joey .
me and chandler live across the hall .
and he &apos;s away a lot .
joey , stop hitting on her !
it &apos;s her wedding day !
what , like there &apos;s a rule or something ?
i got it .
please don &apos;t do that again , it &apos;s a horrible sound .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s paul .
oh , god , is it 6 : 30 ? buzz him in .
who &apos;s paul ?
paul the wine guy , paul ?
maybe .
wait . your &apos; not a real date &apos; tonight

ooh , this is a dear diary moment .
rach , wait , i can cancel ...

are , are you okay ? i mean , do you want me to stay ?
that &apos;d be good ...
really ?
no , go on !
it &apos;s paul the wine guy !

or he just complains a lot ?
hi , come in ! paul , this is ...

okay , sit down . two seconds .
ooh , i just pulled out four eyelashes . that can &apos;t be good .
hey , paul , here &apos;s a tip .
she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot
over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red .
shut up , joey !
so rachel , what &apos;re you , uh ... what &apos;re you up to tonight ?
well , i was kinda supposed to be
headed for aruba on my honeymoon , so nothing !
right , you &apos;re not even getting your honeymoon , god ..
no , no , although , aruba , this time of year ... talk about your
big lizards ...
anyway , if you don &apos;t feel like being alone tonight ,
joey and chandler are coming over to help me
put together my new furniture .
yes , and we &apos;re very excited about it .
well actually thanks ,
but i think i &apos;m just gonna hang out here tonight .
it &apos;s been kinda a long day .
okay , sure .
hey , pheebs , you wanna help ?
oh , i wish i could , but i don &apos;t want to .
* love is sweet as summer showers , *
* love is a wondrous work of art . *
* but your love , oh , your love , your love , *
* is like a giant pigeon *
* crapping on my heart . *
thank you .
i &apos;m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things ,
using a bunch of these little worm guys .
i have no brackety thing , i see no whim guys whatsoever
and i cannot feel my legs .
we got a bookcase .
it &apos;s beautiful .
what &apos;s this ?
i would have to say that is an &apos; l &apos; -shaped bracket .
i have no idea .
done with the bookcase !
all finished !
this was carol &apos;s favorite beer .
she always drank it out of the can , i should have known .
if you &apos;re gonna start with that stuff we &apos;re outta here .
please don &apos;t spoil all this fun .
ross , let me ask you a question .
she got the furniture , the stereo , the good tv-
what did you get ?
you guys .
oh , my god .
you got screwed .
oh my god !
oh my god !
i know , i know , i &apos;m such an idiot .
i guess i should have caught on when
she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .
i mean , how clean can teeth get ?
my brother &apos;s going through that right now , he &apos;s such a mess .
how did you get through it ?
well , you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,
say her ...
... leg ?
that &apos;s one way ! me , i-
i went for the watch .
you actually broke her watch ?
the worst thing i ever did was
i @-@ i shredded my old boyfriend &apos;s favorite bath towel .
steer clear of you .
that &apos;s right .
barry , i &apos;m sorry ... i am so sorry ...
i know you probably think that this is all about
what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on ,
but it isn &apos;t ... it isn &apos;t , it &apos;s about me , and i just ...
hi , machine cut me off again ...
anyway ... look , look ,
i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky
to become mrs. barry finkel .
but it isn &apos;t me . it &apos;s not me .
not that i have any idea who &quot; me &quot; is right now ,
but you just have to give me a chance to ...
i &apos;m divorced .
i &apos;m only 26 , and i &apos;m divorced !
shut up !
you must stop !
that only took me an hour .
look , ross , you gotta understand ,
between us
we haven &apos;t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .
you , however have had the love of a woman for four years .
four years of closeness and sharing
at the end of which she ripped your heart out ,
and that is why we don &apos;t do it !
i don &apos;t think that was my point !
you know what the scariest part is ?
what if there &apos;s only one woman for everybody , y &apos;know ?
i mean what if you get one woman-
and that &apos;s it ?
unfortunately in my case , there was only one woman- for her ...
what are you talking about ? &apos; one woman &apos; ?
that &apos;s like saying there &apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you .
lemme tell you something , ross . there &apos;s lots of flavors out there .
there &apos;s rocky road , and cookie dough , and bing ! cherry vanilla .
you could get &apos; em with jimmies , or nuts , or whipped cream !
this is the best thing that ever happened to you !
you got married , you were , like , what , eight ?
welcome back to the world ! grab a spoon !
i honestly don &apos;t know if i &apos;m hungry or horny .
stay out of my freezer !
ever since she walked out on me , i , uh ...
what ? ... what , you wanna spell it out with noodles ?
no , it &apos;s , it &apos;s more of a fifth date kinda revelation .
oh , so there is gonna be a fifth date ?
isn &apos;t there ?
yeah ... yeah , i think there is .
what were you gonna say ?
well , ever @-@ ev- ... ever since she left me ,
um , i haven &apos;t been able to , uh , perform .
... sexually .
oh , god , oh , god , i am sorry ...
i am so sorry ...
it &apos;s okay ...
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now .
um ... how long ?
two years .
wow ! i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m glad you smashed her watch !
so you still think you , um ... might want that fifth date ?
... yeah . yeah , i do .
we are gathered here to join joanie louise cunningham ..
and charles chachi @-@ chachi @-@ chachi arcola
in the bonds of holy matrimony .
oh ... see ... but joanne loved chachi !
that &apos;s the difference !
grab a spoon .
do you know how long it &apos;s been since i &apos;ve grabbed a spoon ?
do the words &apos; billy , don &apos;t be a hero &apos; mean anything to you ?
great story . but i gotta go .
i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea ... oh man ,
andrea &apos;s the screamer . angela has cats .
right , thanks . it &apos;s julie . i &apos;m out of here .
y &apos;know , here &apos;s the thing .
even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out , ...
who am i gonna ask ?
isn &apos;t this amazing ?
i mean , i have never made coffee before in my entire life .
that is amazing .
congratulations .
y &apos;know , i figure if i can make coffee ,
there isn &apos;t anything i can &apos;t do .
no , i think it &apos;s ,
&quot; if i can invade poland ,
there &apos;s nothing i can &apos;t do . &quot;
listen , while you &apos;re on a roll
if you feel like you have to make a western omelet or something ..
although actually i &apos;m really not that hungry ...

y &apos;know before me , there was no snap in his turtle for two years .
of course it was a line !
why ? ! why ? why , why would anybody do something like that ?
i assume we &apos;re looking for an answer more sophisticated
than &apos; to get you into bed &apos; .
i hate men . i hate men .
don &apos;t hate . you don &apos;t want to put that out into the universe .
is it me ?
is it like i have some sort of beacon
that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear ?

i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t know it was a line !
guess what ?

um ... my ... father .
oh god , come on you guys , is this really necessary ?
i mean , i can stop charging anytime i want .
c &apos;mon , you can &apos;t live off your parents your whole life .
i know that . that &apos;s why i was getting married .
give her a break , it &apos;s hard being on your own for the first time .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . i remember when i first came to this city .
i was fourteen .
my mom had just killed herself and my step @-@ dad was back in prison ,
and i got here , and i didn &apos;t know anybody .
and i ended up living with this albino guy who was , like ,
cleaning windshields outside port authority ,
and then he killed himself ,
and then i found aromatherapy .
so believe me , i know exactly how you feel .
the word you &apos;re looking for is
&quot; anyway ... &quot;
all right , you ready ?

it &apos;s kinda like a symbolic gesture .
rachel , that was a library card .

y &apos;know , if you listen closely ,
you can hear a thousand retailers scream .

i always figured you just thought
i was monica &apos;s geeky older brother .
