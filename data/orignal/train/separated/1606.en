You slept with him? Girl, what is wrong with you?
I think you're in a position to become the spokesperson
the foster community has been waiting for.
So you flunking out huh?
Yeah, I can't go back unless
I want to keep taking steroids and I don't.
What is that for?
We used to have somebody come play happy hours.
Why, you play?
Those people you almost killed, it was the Fosters.
What do you think's gonna happen
if I arrest the only family he's got left?
Can we at least wait till after the funeral?
Either you coming with me, or you ain't never gonna see me again.
Let's go.
She has what we call stage zero breast cancer.
So I've been doing some research,
and they just published this 20-year-study
on women with what you have DCIS,
and the mortality rate for women who opted for mastectomy
was no less than the women who opted for radiation and lumpectomy.
Uh, okay does that mean?
It means that a lot of people are choosing really extreme measures
when they don't have to.
In fact there are some doctors here
who recommend active surveillance over any kind of surgery.
You mean like, doing nothing?
No, no, you keep a close eye on things,
you have your mammogram and your MRIs twice a year.
Well that's not exactly an option that Dr. Kopack offered.
I think the point is
that a lot of people hear the word cancer and they can overreact.
You know this is not an emergency situation.
I just I think I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed.
I just I can't talk about this right now.
If that's okay?
We can talk about it whenever you're ready.
Okay.
I just, you're not alone in this.
I know.
I'm sorry, I just I think I feel
a little...
It's okay.
No, it's not.
It's okay.
I'm not trying to push you away.
I know. It's really okay.
"Lexi for prexi" really?
What are we, in the sixth grade?
She's never even been interested in student government,
She just wants to win this stupid popularity contest.
She's supposed to be my best friend.
I feel like Taylor Swift when Katy Perry stabbed her in the back.
What?
Except in my case, Lexi didn't just poach my back of dancer,
she stole my music too.
Talk about bad blood.
But you know what? It's on.
Well thanks for the sympathetic ear.
Really appreciate it.
Hey, are you busy?
Uh, yeah, I'm kinda practicing.
It's late.
Yeah. I wanna get in at least
four hours a day before my Juilliard audition.
And now that I'm working at the smokehouse,
this is the only time I've got, so...
What's wrong?
Did you ever tell anyone about
what we did in Idyllwild?
No.
Why?
Did you?
All right, here we go.
Dig in.
So, it's not real sausage?
It's real.
It's Soyrizo.
It's just never had a face.
And can I just say how awesome it is
to have some fellow vegans in the house.
That's me!
Vegan and loving it.
Well you guys know, every vegan saves over 100 animals a year.
I'm not gonna lie,
I miss bacon.
"Love goes towards love as school boys from their books,
but love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
What's that supposed to mean?
It means being apart from the one you love is hard.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Good morning everyone.
Good morning.
Thank you for making breakfast.
Look at that.
It's vegan sausage.
Oh, that looks good.
what is this thing?
Hey mama, do I have to take Shakespeare?
Yes, it's a requirement.
Just like your senior projects.
Have you guys given any thought to what you're gonna do?
But doesn't my audition Juilliard count?
Sorry, doesn't work like that.
I'm thinking about doing a photo essay on...
something.
On something. Okay.
Well, you guys better figure it out quickly.
And also you need to get a move on
because I have a dentist appointment.
You're all riding with Brandon this morning.
You actually expect all of us to fit in that sardine can?
You could walk?
Or we could drive ourselves if anyone around here
had the time to help us log our permit hours.
Okay, enough, enough.
You guys get going, please, get going.
Hey Mariana, feel free to clear your pla...
Oh, my god.
Oh, I need money for a new wrestling uniform
cause I d fit in the old one anymore.
Uh, Jesus,
You're, um...
not gonna be wrestling this year.
What what, why?
Because your actions at Flintwood have to have consequences.
I thought the consequence was not getting to go back there?
You gave into peer pressure,
and you made some really bad decisions.
Yeah, but I stopped taking the steroids
and I told you guys.
Well, this is not up for discussion.
And feel fre clear your plate either.
Are you sure that's good parenting?
Or, let me rephrase that question.
Do you think it's a good idea to take away from him
something that he really loves,
which also helps him get that testosterone out?
Mom, it's not a consequence if it's not something that he loves.
Okay.
I'm just gonna mind my own business.
I just wanna tell you
that I'm not in any rush to go on my trip.
So I'm gonna stay here
and see you through the mastectomy and recovery.
And I wanna be here for as long as I can be helpful.
Sharon, we don't know that she's having a mastectomy.
She has cancer.
She has a pre-cancerous condition that may not turn into cancer.
All right, well, you know what?
When the doctor told me I had pre-cancerous cells in my uterus
I didn't mess around... I got a hysterectomy like that!
Okay, well, there are studies now
that are saying that most hysterectomies are probably unnecessary.
You know, they have a different study every five minutes.
I mean, at first they say that
"Oh red wine is the fountain of youth."
And the next it's, "Oh, it's liquid death."
Come on, Stefanie, look,
when you have cancer, you just cut it out.
I really think we need to be proactive here.
Okay I think we need to take our time and make an informed decision.
And I think that you should go on your vacation, mom.
Have fun, yeah?
I'm not gonna have any fun till I know what the plan is.
So, until then...
we were wondering if we could pull the RV into your driveway?
Oh, yeah, we need to borrow some electricity.
Not quite off the grid yet, Will?
I'm looking into solar panels.
Oh, hey, I got something for you.
What's this?
Cannabis oil.
High in antioxidants, being used to ease cancers,
among other things.
I take a drop under my tongue every morning.
Do you?
Yeah.
It can also be vaporized or use it as a suppository.
I've been putting it on my elbows for my psoriasis,
And look, it's just smooth as a baby's butt.
I am a cop.
You do remember that, right, mom?
我请了病假
I'll be right back.
You puke or something?
Huh? Oh, no, no. I'm just... I'm just taking a personal day.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what time is the funeral tomorrow?
Three.
I'll take Ty in after?
Yup.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.
真的很抱歉
You see this guy?
Hey, you nearly took my door off.
Sorry, dude, I didn't see you...
Oh, damn.
How many clowns you got in that car?
Excuse me?
Jesus, settle.
Hi, I'm Mariana Foster.
You must be new here?
Yeah, I'm Nick.
What year are you in?
Junior.
I'm a junior, too.I'm running for class president.
I'd love your vote.
Welcome to Anchor Beach.
Come on.
Need a hand?
Uh, sure.
Thanks, superhot.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, hey, I was, um, I was just...
helping her with the poster.
Lexi for prexi?
Oh, and I suppose you're just helping, too?
Cupcakes? Seriously?
Yeah, and it's my job.
I'm Lexi's campaign manager.
Heard you were back.
That's too bad.
Can I have one?
No!
Okay, then.
Well, hey, can I get your keys?
I'm gonna go to Girls United at lunch to talk to Daphne.
I don't understand why you told her in the first place.
I'm sorry, okay? I just needed somebody to talk to.
You think I don't wish I had someone to talk to?
You know, that's how secrets stop being secret, Callie.
When you tell people.
Come here.
What are you doing?
You know my history with Hayley.
She totally stole my dance routine.
Dance routine?
Mariana, Emma stole my boyfriend.
Uh, you do know that Hayley stole Jesus, too, right?
Yeah, from Emma,
Which puts Hayley and me on the same team.
Look, my old friends weren't there for me,
so I had to make new ones.
You know what, Lexi?
This election isn't popularity contest.
It's about ideas.
I have ideas.
Oh, really, like what?
Hey, Lexi, love your plan to install composting bins in the quad.
Thanks, Sally, I just hate seeing all that waste,
Just like go to waste, you know?
Totally.
Hey, Mariana.
Hi, Sally.
That was my idea.
Was it?
I better get to class.
Lexi stole our composting idea.
And our student body president practically endorsed her just now.
You want Sally Benton's endorsement?
We just have to show her
who has the real ideas, so...
We challenge Lexi to a debate.
And then it just disappeared?
Yeah, I guess whoever put the comment up must have taken it down.
Maybe it was Brooke messing with you?
She's in juvie, how would she even get to a computer?
Maybe she made her freaky boyfriend do it?
Tell Brandon I didn't tell nobody about you two at Idyllwild,
so he can stop being mad at me.
How is it with you and him?
I mean, it's hard.
But, um...
you know, we're friends first, so, at least we're in it together.
I think I'm going to this comic convention thing with A.J.
Oh, yeah?
You back in the saddle with him?
No!
Stop. It's not, like, a "Date" Date.
It's just a...
A good idea?
'Cause he is fine.
Shush!
His grandma just died, so...
That's too bad.
I tried to text him to see if he wanted me to come to the funeral,
But, um, he didn't answer. I hope he's okay.
Maybe he just needs some time, you know?
I mean, do you have any idea what it's like
trying to get over someone when you have to see them every day?
Yeah. That must be hard.
And now she's running for junior class president,
And her picture's plastered everywhere,
so I can't get away from her.
At least you don't have to live with her.
What?
Look, if you're this hung up on her, just...
get back together with her.
I mean, it's not like there's
some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.
I just wish I have something else that I could think about, you know?
Hey, what about our senior project?
Maybe we could do something together?
You know what I need?
I need to meet someone new.
I need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around.
You know what I mean?
Hello?
Uh, yeah, I do.
I'll be right back.
Are you gonna finish that?
So, what else is going on with Fost and Found?
Is that lady really gonna put all that money into it?
Justina? Yeah, I think so.
She wants me to do a photoshoot next weekend.
A photoshoot?
Damn.
No, not like that.
It's probably gonna just be like her and her phone.
It's low-key.
She's really, really pushing this whole role model thing.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. I guess.
Hey, I just thought of something.
What if the person who posted that comment was talking about Liam?
So, are you, like, stalking me now?
What are you doing here?
Oh, My school is just around there.
Oh, right.
Yeah. Heh.
So, is this, like, your spot?
Yeah. Best break in San Diego.
You ever get out on the water.
Me? Oh, no, no.
Too busy, and... lame.
You go to school on the beach and you don't surf?
Yeah.
You are lame.
Yeah.
If you ever wanna, you know, learn,
I could teach you a few things.
Okay. Yeah.
So, maybe sometime that... that'd be... rad.
You know surfers don't really talk like that, right?
Yeah, no, no, I know, I...
I'm just teasing.
Yeah, that would be rad.
All right.
So, I'll see you at work?
Okay.
Hey, You hungry?
Will made some tempeh sliders.
I... I'm not really hungry.
I don't wanna ruin dinner.
Good thinking.
So, how you holding up, honey?
I'm fine.
You know, when Frank and I were first married he was in the navy,
and we did that long distance thing for three years.
How was that like?
It sucked.
But when he did get a leave,
and we had a few days together,
It just made them all the more precious.
And our feet barely on the floor, if you know what I mean.
But not that I'm encouraging that kind of thing,
I know, grandma.
You know, I... well, okay.
I mean, my point is that sometimes the distance
actually does make the heart grow fonder.
Pigweed.
Huh? What?
I was ouging and I found pigweed growing
right out there in the backyard.
Really?
Yeah.
Try this.
Oh, thanks.
Good?
That's... Awesome.
Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's best just to focus on
how nice it's going to be when you do see Connor
as opposed to how bad it feels when you don't.
I'll try. Thanks, grandma.
You bet.
Well, it's nice to see that
somebody around here appreciates my advice.
As opposed to my daughter who you know
if I say orange, she says tangerine.
You know, when she was little
I could ever get her to do anything I really wanted her to do
I was saying "Oh, don't do that."
Did that work?
Every time.
Do you actually think someone would be that cruel
to ask if you had sex with Liam?
He wasn't convicted of rape,
and I'm sure there are people out there
who are gonna think whatever they're gonna think.
And he was my foster brother, so...
Yeah, you're probably right.
They're probably talking about Liam.
Guess I should feel relieved.
No, you shouldn't. It's sick.
Of course, I did have sex with a foster brother.
Callie, don't.
What, I did.
And what if somebody does find out?
We didn't do anything wrong, okay?
We really thought you were never getting adopted...
We never thought you were gonna get adopted.
Are we just telling ourselves that?
I mean, I have this huge secret.
How am I supposed to let people think
that I'm some kind of role model?
Because you are.
You are.
Callie, you survived the system,
and you helped a lot of people.
I think you're just afraid...
to be more than the poor foster girl
with the sad story and the hard life.
But that's not who you are anymore.
You have the chance to be so much more.
To be happy.
And to go out and shine in the world.
The only thing holding you back is you.
And you're holding me back too.
I'm sorry, I thought we were in this together.
We can't be in this together.
Not if we want to move on.
Yeah, come in.
Hi.
Hi, ma.
I just wanted to tell you that, uh...
I've changed my mind.
After a lot of consideration,
I've decided that it's really,
really not a good idea to have the mastectomy.
Okay. Thanks for the update.
I do think that you should have the lumpectomy,
as well as looking into other therapies along with the cannabis oil.
Like, um, you know, acupuncture,
and the white light meditation,
and the art of positive thinking.
But I definitely don't think
that you should do anything prophylactic.
I don't think so.
Got it.
Thanks, mom.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Well, that was a 180.
Maybe she's read the research?
Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?
No, but I will.
I will. I just really want to get this thing with Ty over with.
After we arrest him tomorrow,
I'm gonna make a decision about what I'm gonna do.
Which we will talk about,
together. I promise. Okay?
Should we wait a bit longer?
Uh, no, I don't think they're coming.
We should probably get started then.
Okay.
Where'd you get the board?
Uh, it's my brother's.
That your brother's wetsuit, too?
No.
No, it's...
What, you make fun of all your students?
Just the most promising ones.
You ready?
Are you sure there's not, like, a second best break in San Diego?
One that's, like, smaller?
Relax. You're just gonna practice on the shore breaks.
Come on.
Where are they, Mike?
I thought they'd show up for their grandmother's funeral.
Look, Stef, I swear I didn't tip off A.J.
Maybe Ty got spooked,
when you brought Olsen back in for questioning again.
Look, I'm sorry.
I know you're angry,
It was my idea to wait till after the funeral,
So go head, let me have it.
We'll just have to find them.
That's it?
Could be worse, I could have cancer.
That's not funny.
No, it's not.
Yeah
Is something going on?
You okay?
I'm fine.
I just... I have, they call it stage zero breast cancer.
What?
What does that mean, stage zero?
It means that I don't have it...
Yet.
But, I could get it.
I don't know. It's just kinda confusing.
Well, so...
what are you supposed to do?
Well, I could get a lutomy and have radiation,
Or I could have a mastectomy.
What do you want to do?
You know me.
I really don't want to sit around waiting and wondering.
I would rather just, uh...
Just get a mastectomy and not have to worry about it.
Sorry, Stef.
Now I can get that boob job I've always wanted.
What are you talking about? You've got great boobs.
Eh, you haven't seen 'em lately.
Is it just get awkward?
Yeah, it sure did.
I'll see you later.
Not only am I well aware of our current parking lot crisis,
but I'm already in talks
with the vice principal to find overflow spaces
for all of our new students.
How do we know that you'll be able
竞选高三班长
to follow through on all these promises of yours
when the vice principal is your own mother?
Well, last year I led the entire sophomore class on a walkout
竞选高三班长
to protest against the firing of one of our favorite teachers,
and my mother re-hired him.
Or, I'm sorry, were you not there for that?
Mariana,
What's your position on prescription drugs
being sold to students at anchor beach?
Um, well, obviously, I mean, I'm against it.
It's definitely something that we should combat.
Lexi,
What's your stance on having free condoms in the bathrooms?
Well, I, um...
Safe sex is important,
and we obviously want to prevent pregnancy,
so...
At the time, or the morning after?
Well, I can say as your junior class president,
I can be trusted.
Trusted?
How can you trust someone
who stabs their best friend in the back?
I did not stab you in the back.
Please, you are just running against me
because you're jealous I'm not living in your shadow anymore.
Jealous of you? Get real.
Okay, I think we need to get back on topic here.
Okay, and you're the one that stabbed me in the back.
Wait, how did I stab you in the back?
You know what, just shut up.
No, you shut up!
You shut up!
I think this debate is over.
You all right?
Anything broken?
Just my pride.
Just my pride.
Come on, you're doing great.
I was way worse than you my first time out.
Really?
No.
But still, you'll get it.
Here, why don't we catch you this whitewater?
All right, this one's your wave.
All right, ready? Paddle, paddle, paddle!
Go, go, go, go, go!
There she is.
What's all this for?
Your photoshoot.
Sorry, um, I just... I thought
it was just gonna be you and your phone or something.
Oh, God no, I can't take a decent selfie.
Callie. Callie, you're not just an inspiration,
you're an aspiration.
I mean, for foster kids everywhere.
I mean, if they can see it, they can be it.
So, let's show them all they can be.
Okay, now, don't kill me,
but I was at the mall today, shopping for myself, I swear,
and I found a few things that would look great on you.
Wouldn't this look amazing on you?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I love it.
That... Apparently is why I don't surf.
No, you were great.
It was your first time out. Baby steps, right?
Here.
So, I've completely blown my chances.
Did you... did you think this was a date?
No. No, no, no, not like a "date" date.
I mean, did you not think that... anything?
Well...
Okay. Feeling like a complete idiot now.
No, no, I mean...
It's definitely...
Um, I'm just kind of getting out of something.
You know?
Yeah.
I do know, actually.
What's her name?
I can't really talk about it.
Oh, no, you're right.
That's more of a second "non-date" date conversation.
You know, it's fine.
It was mutual.
We, uh... and it wasn't because we didn't want to be together.
It was... there was, um...
these reasons that got in the way.
And we thought the main reason went away,
so we finally...
hooked up?
Yeah.
And then that reason came crashing back.
So, you're star-crossed lovers?
I guess you can say that.
What about you?
Did you really break up with someone,
or are you just trying to let me down gently?
No, I, um,
I did, actually, recently have a breakup,
but I'm pretty much over it.
How'd you do that? Any advice?
I surf.
Great.
It's where I work things out. It's in the water.
And then, when I get back to my life,
all of a sudden, my problems
just don't seem so problematic anymore.
You must have something in your life that makes you feel that way?
Sometimes my music.
While there you go.
竞选高三班长
It's probably a sign, huh?
I'm sorry that got so ugly.
Me too.
I know you're not jealous of me.
I kinda am, actually.
I mean, I had to go back to Honduras
and you got to stay here.
I missed a whole year and
when I got back you were different.
More confident and prettier,
and running class president.
I felt like everyone had forgotten about me.
I didn't forget you.
But you had new friends, like Emma.
You know first she stole Jesus, and then you,
and now she's your best friend.
No, Emma's not my best friend.
You're my best friend and you always will be.
No matter how much we change.
I don't even really wanna be junior class president.
You could always drop out.
Well...
I've come this far.
Circus left town without you, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
You want a ride?
Thanks.
This is sick. It's yours?
Yeah, one of the few perks of being an only child.
I get 700 horse power all to myself.
Yeah, but you don't actually get to use it though around here?
Dude, I took it up to 120 last weekend.
Shut up.
Where?
Oh my god, girl, you look amazing.
Ooh, and you're totally smizing in this one.
Smizing?
Smiling with your eyes.
What happened to you?
She had a photoshoot for Fost and Found.
Oh, so you're, like, America's Top Foster Model now?
Hey, don't be a jerk. She looks gorgeous.
No, I'm sorry. I just...
You don't really look like you.
You don't get to do that.
What?
You don't get to tell me to go out and shine in the world
and then make me feel bad.
No, I wasn't trying to...
No, you hold me back, too, Brandon.
It's not just on me.
No, you like me as the poor foster girl
who needs you to save her.
So, if you wanna move on, if you want me to move on,
do not drag me back down.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Hey, Cal?
Have you, um...
You seen or heard from AJ at all?
No, he hasn't been answering any of my texts.
You?
Uh, he doesn't have his phone.
Um, he, uh... He took off.
Why?
Don't know.
We think he's with his brother.
Anyway, if you hear from him, you let me know.
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
I know that you don't know what you're going to do yet, but I...
There are some things that
I think we should talk about as a couple.
Like what?
Well, if...
If you decide that
you need to do something as aggressive as a mastectomy,
from what I'm reading, after a surgery like that,
a lot of women suffer from depression,
and loss of self-esteem, lack of sex drive.
Mine or yours?
What do you mean?
You afraid you're not gonna be attracted to me anymore?
No.
That's not what I'm saying at all.
Okay.
Honey, it's...
It's major surgery.
It's not like getting implants or something.
You might... you might be...
Disfigured?
You might not like the way you look.
And in most cases it requires multiple surgeries
over a long period of time.
It's not like they just cut them off and it's done with.
Sorry.
No, I... I know.
All I'm saying is
why do something so drastic to your beautiful body
if you don't have to?
*From forth the fatal loins of these two foes*
*A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life*
*Who's misadventure piteous overthrows*
*Doth with their death*
*bury their parents' strife*
That's all I got so far,
but what do you think?
A rock opera.
Yeah, why not?
Well, Shakespeare's pretty... intense.
Well, you know, we'll edit down the play,
you know, to basic story points,
And we'll make all the lyrics in modern english.
Still, it sounds like a lot of work for a senior project.
Well, it'll be fun.
Come on. And this will give you a chance
to pour all that heartbreak into it.
You know, like a catharsis.
That's really why I thought of it.
Thanks, man.
No problem.
I'm in.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Yeah, it's an old factory road or something.
Nobody ever comes down here.
Whoa, what are you doing?
We didn't come out here so you could ride shotgun.
But I just have my permit.
I don't care.
Well, cops might.
The cops don't even know this road is here.
Now do you wanna drive or not?
All right, let's see what she can do.
What are you waiting for?
Drive.
Come on.
Yeah, let's go. Pedal to the metal.
Open her up! Let's break 100, come on!
Don't be a wuss!
How's it feel?
Awesome.
Car! Car!
Yes! Yes!
Oh my God, your pictures are already up on Fost and Found.
Look at all the comments you've already gotten.
Well, here they are.
Hey, Ma, um...
I've decided to get the lumpectomy.
What?
No. No. No.
No? Oh my...
I thought that's what you wanted me to do!?
Well, I only told you to do that
so that you would do the opposite like you always do.
That's ri... That's ridiculous.
What are you talking about?
You never agree with me on anything.
That's not true, Mom!
That's not true!
You're disagreeing with me right now.
Ma, oh my...
So you used reverse psychology on me about this?
Well, it always worked when you were a child.
Okay, first of all, Mom, I'm not a child anymore,
and I don't appreciate you using these kind of mind games on me
on something that's so important!
I just wanted you to make the right decision.
And I have.
You haven't.
I have.
You have not,
That's it, Mom.
This is done! I am done!
Okay.
Done.
I will be in the RV
when you come to your senses and decide to outlive me.
Anything good?
Just bills, yeah.
