this has been a bad week , even for you , simpson .
concrete in the sandbox ?
i don &apos;t get lost anymore !
spreading the rumor that today &apos;s lunch
would be served by a naked lady .
move it ! boobs ! boobs !
i want to see boobs in the soup !
there is no naked lunch lady ! bart made it up !
yes , yes , i- i knew that .
there &apos;s no hope for you , simpson .
you &apos;ll be locked in detention
until you graduate to the penal system .
penal .
stop laughing ! i said &quot; penal , &quot; not &quot; penile . &quot;
penile .
it &apos;s not like you made me say &quot; penis &quot; !
someone could get really hurt by this .
stick your finger in that desk .
really , bart ?
looks like ancient aramaic .
fortunately , i have an app for that .
hey !
&quot; he who reads this rune translation
will be taken to damnation &quot; ?
simpson !
we &apos;re in hell ? !
cool ! now i can look up all those people
who said &quot; see you in hell . &quot;
hey , pal , what are you in here for ?
heresies , like docetism .
docetism ?
the belief that jesus &apos; body was just an illusion .
is that still big ?
haw @-@ haw ! your heresies were venialized
by the council of palermo .
oh , shut up , shut up , shut up !
we &apos;ve got millipedes , toothheads , screaming torsos ...
... your bleeding eyes with finger @-@ legs .
and all the girls are mean girls .
red dress , how original .
making fun of someone &apos;s clothes . how original .
huh . you want to walk with us ?
it &apos;s true .
it would be a cold day in hell when i was popular .
young man , where &apos;s your hell pass ?
skin him !
so , what would be the appropriate eternal torture
for someone who robbed a bank ?
someone who robs a bank .
how would you punish them for all time ?
mm ... jeffistopheles ?
uh ... wh @-@ whipping ?
okay . good .
no one likes to be whipped ,
but is there anything more connected to the sin ?
torture ?
what if you made the robber eat bags of money
until his stomach exploded ?
good . very good .
psychological torment .
pain plus fear .
oh , can you all feel how much richer that is ?
you get a pumpkin sticker .
this has never happened before .
i have a crush on my teacher !
down here , we can make that happen .
every time the sinner screams in pain ,
the scream blows this windmill ,
which pumps even more piranhas into his aquarium underwear ,
causing more screaming .
wow . wow . oh , that is so evil .
and i know evil . i &apos;m head of the teachers &apos; union .
bart , i found a portal back to earth .
right here ?
no , no , no , no ! that &apos;s super hell !
hot stuff ?
i didn &apos;t realize you were that evil .
no , i &apos;m being punished for how lame my comics were .
i melted it . get it ?
welcome to earth . local time is 10 : 37 .
we know you have your choice of portals ,
so thank you for choosing the burns hellport ,
a division of gulf and western .
mom , dad ,
i want to change schools .
i found a place that really wants to teach me ,
and i really want to learn .
homie , our prayers have been answered .
keep your pants on , marge .
it &apos;s probably some private school
that costs a million dollars a year ,
and then they squeeze you for extra money
through book fairs and silent auctions .
and parents get 20 e @-@ mails a day from the school ,
and everyone hits &quot; reply all &quot; to everything .
dad , it &apos;s not a private school .
it &apos;s free .
oh , that &apos;s fine then .
i couldn &apos;t help noticing this school is located in ...
i &apos;m not one to judge , but , um ...
i &apos;ll say it , marge . it &apos;s in hell !
the inferno ! perdition !
arizona without the golf !
no . we do have golf , but all the greens are tricky .
no !
look , as educators ,
our job is to gently nurture your child &apos;s passion .
hmm . that is the kind of nonsense you &apos;re always falling for .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
well , i guess we could try it for a semester .
thank you ! thank you ! thank you !
you know , we have many opportunities for parent involvement .
yeah , i &apos;ll be sure to take a look at that .

that was me , when i was a young hoodlink ,
with me three bestest glugs , leonard , carlton and dum .
we was narsty tastards , we were , even though we dressed
like carol channing &apos;s backup dancers .
some days , we &apos;d employ a bit of the bash
while having a go at the west end wiseguys ...
ooh , stop it ! - hey , pally , come on .

ooh , i was told this would be a verbal debate ! ooh !
and cap off the night with a little of the ol &apos; in @-@ out .

oy ! i &apos;m getting hitched to this bluebird ,
and she wants me to give up the glug life .
welly , welly , well , well , well .
what sorry future could you have
without your truest lunos by your side ?
dum got a job at the tower of london
as a beefeater !
i hope it &apos;s what i think it is .
who knew , my brothers , that when dum found his dumpling
that was the end of our band of glugs ?
leonard and carl informed me my leadership
was no longer needed .
not the shard ! not the shard !
so i took up the respectable life
of a sleazy barkeep .
these eye clamps are the only way i can tolerate today &apos;s tv .
tonight on fox ...
turn it off ! i &apos;ll be good !
i &apos;ll be good !
there &apos;s been a terrible accident , sir .
please grant me access to your home .
are you kidding me ?
i invented that gag .

to completely unbolt his door .
come on , you can &apos;t pull the wooly bull over my viddyballs .
that &apos;s a bit of the old ... haw @-@ haw !
not my shmoo !
not my shmoo !
those punks got no respect for them what come before .
didn &apos;t even wear no codpieces .
how do they expect to draw the eye to their chunky @-@ wunks ?
i need me glugs back for one last bit of barmy .
no ! you should not be out glugging ,
shin @-@ slicing , or eye groining .
we &apos;ve got a sweet little toddle to take care of .
enough of this quiet home life !
it &apos;s time to be a man again .
after all these month @-@ os , i hope we don &apos;t disremember
how to dash and bash .
let &apos;s start easy with a little walk into the jay .
wait ! i recognize those cops
what &apos;s be whackin &apos; my gob @-@ topper !
it &apos;s leonard and carlton !
you blokes want to join me for one last bit o &apos; noggin &apos; boggin &apos; ?
i saved your bowlers .

all slow @-@ motion like-- and just as scarifyin&apos;
and intimidato as ever .

i couldn &apos;t score at an orgy .
but i was happy .
《 登月谎言 》

and , uh , let &apos;s start all over .
stupid blood-- asking me for a favor !
homer , homer , look what someone left in the kitchen .
frosty chocolate milkshakes .
dad , the tv &apos;s screwed up .
it only plays married with children .
aw , peg , you &apos;re sick .
let me call dr. kevorkian .
we haven &apos;t had sex in four years , al .
now i &apos;m the one who needs kevorkian .
our house .
this house is haunted .
the milkshakes have vanished !
hmm ? what ?
homie , i think we &apos;re not alone .
i was sleeping in the dryer and got caught in your sheets .
i &apos;ll go make up the couch for you .
whoa , marge , that was fast .
yeah , that &apos;s it , baby .
grab my chest with your cold , icy hands .
the bed is lifting me !
the elevator at work can &apos;t even do that .
i demand you put me down right after the sex !
all right , show yourselves
in the name of this book !
the power of chrysler compels you !

what are you , cavemen ?
turn on the lights !
hey ! a little respect !
take a picture-- it &apos;ll last longer , man .
hey , if you &apos;re homer simpson , show me your driver &apos;s license !
well , i traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich .
he is me !
noble spirits , your time has passed .
that was unmotivated .
don &apos;t have a cow , man .
shut up !
homer , do something !
why is it always me ?
i work 12 hours a week , you know .
she doesn &apos;t know what a good thing she &apos;s got .
i like a man who can relax .
not like grumpy @-@ lumpy there .
quit makin &apos; cracks !
speaking of cracks , pull up your pants , dude .
i &apos;ll crack you !
what kind of afterlife is this ?
can &apos;t even strangle my dead kid .
so yeah , things aren &apos;t perfect with the missus and me ,
and , uh , by the way , nice melons .
those are in the kitchen !
d &apos;oh ! i can &apos;t believe you wasted our money on fruit !
homer simpson !
can you be more specific ?
there &apos;s no reason to be jealous .
it &apos;s just younger you .
oh ! so , he likes ghosts better , eh ?
fine .
might as well clean this while i &apos;m killing myself .
well , hello @-@ ho @-@ ho .
aah ! a ghost !
i feel like a ghost ,
the way you haven &apos;t been paying attention to me .
plus , i &apos;m dead .
don &apos;t yell at me-- i &apos;m a double widower .
but i can handle all the ghosts you can float at me .
won &apos;t the other homer be a problem ?
heh ! i think he gets it .
see ? he ...
you stupid ...
what the ... ? ooh !
i smell toast .
well , i guess you and i are in charge now , bart.
but if we split the chores , i &apos;m sure that we c ...
what are you doing ? !
sayonara , sucker !
oh , no , you &apos;re not leaving me to clean this up !
i &apos;m the last of the simpsons !
in i.q. only !
thank you !
willie &apos;s got stew for the winter .
wait a minute-- who killed maggie ?
this is all your fault , homer , for wanting somebody new .
i just wanted the woman i married .
i never realized you had so much work done .
simpsons , please ! this fighting solves nothing !
dr. marvin monroe ? !
are you alive or dead ?
i &apos;m in some horrible limbo .
i can walk halfway through walls , then i get stuck .
now i &apos;m gonna have to look at that every morning .
well , i think you &apos;re helping us make progress .
thank you .
let &apos;s not fight anymore .
let &apos;s just make him decide between us .
choose me because i &apos;m not bitter yet ,
i can stay up later , and you &apos;re on my mind all the time .
hmm , marge number two , how would you win my whoopie ?
those are great reasons , but there &apos;s one reason
you should choose me : because i know everything you &apos;ve done ,
and yet i still want to be with you .
that is so beautiful .
you &apos;re right , marge-- i could never leave you ,
not even for you .
if there was a dot or a squiggle different ,
that would be too much .
oh , homie ! oh , homie !
it &apos;s time to cut the treacle , man .
why , you little ... !
i just had a worrisome thought .
if there can be two incarnations of the simpsons ,
why couldn &apos;t some evil marketing entity
produce millions of others ?
all right , simpsons , welcome to our new home .
yo , yo , santa &apos;s little helper is in da house !
okay , hold still .
this is the last picture on the roll .
isn &apos;t it about time you went digital ?
watch your mouth , you little smart @-@ ass .
yeah , bart.
nothing &apos;s gonna ruin this one .
here we go . here we go .
here we go .
