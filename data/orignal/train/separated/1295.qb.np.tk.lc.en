oh , how &apos;s mine ?
yeah , i knew the beginning part ,
so i felt good about that .
well , i didn &apos;t have enough time for both of the essays ,
but i still think i did really well .
i &apos;ll call you back .
i think what we &apos;re looking for in ...
ok , everybody . right this way .
single file .
oh , crap .
i forgot today was her annual
career @-@ day dog @-@ and @-@ pony show .
detective rizzoli ,
these are the students
from the elizabeth bishop middle school .
are we almost done ? i &apos;ve got a lot of homework .
who here wants to be a detective ?
they must all want to be doctors .
i wanted to go to tweenbeat magazine ,
but that was full .
okay .
well , welcome .
over here , uh , we have a ...
a shoe print from a crime scene .
so we made a plaster cast --
was it a murder ?
uh , yes .
awesome . was it disgusting ?
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s the shot alert .
and that computer software
can triangulate the sound of a gunshot
and find its precise location .
gunshots at boston cambridge university .
what ? !
awesome . somebody else is dead .
wait , no , jane , i &apos;m going with you .
bcu is my alma mater .
what about them ?
they ... wanted to be at some tween magazine , anyway .
let &apos;s go find your parents .
ugh . speaking of parents ...
what is it , ma ?
no , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m working .
your father left me stranded on the side of the road .
just get in the car , ma .
i &apos;m sure he got stuck at a job or something , okay ?
why do you always take his side ?
here we go .
i &apos;m not taking his side .
he &apos;s too busy to fix my car .
he &apos;s got so many other better things to do !
can we talk about this when i &apos;m not working ?
so , you know , i never told you ,
but i &apos;d be really good at solving cases .
well , the forensic sciences can be quite complicated .
a little common sense goes a long way .
i &apos;ve read so many crime novels ,
and i always know who did it .
thank you , agatha christie .
stay in the car .
i won &apos;t embarrass you .
30 years of experience says otherwise .
college campuses are like a foreign country to me .
you went to junior college .
that &apos;s like 13th , 14th grade .
but , jane , you know so much .
so why doesn &apos;t it feel like enough ?
you &apos;re trampling on a crime scene . you got tape ?
no , ma &apos;am .
go into my car .
in the trunk , there &apos;s tape . get it .
and , hey , tell the woman who &apos;s in there to stay put .
in the ... trunk ?
no , in the car !
white female , approximately 20 .
gunshot wound to the chest .
no vitals .
barney fife was first on scene ?
yeah .
no witnesses .
broad daylight , thousands of students , no witnesses ?
hey , they &apos;re all taking finals . and look where she is .
you wanna go back to being partners , just say so .
can you please get a gun dog ,
and look through all the dumpsters ,
the trash cans , and the bushes ?
padding for a laptop , but no computer .
maybe she didn &apos;t have one .
nobody really goes to college without one .
maybe the shooter stole it .
&quot; danielle davis . &quot;
have her dorm room sealed off .
look at this .
maybe it &apos;s hers .
all the texts have been deleted .
get a subpoena to the d.a. &apos; s office
for her phone records , all right ?
a piece of plastic .
get this to the crime lab .
no . no , no .
no , no , no , no .
you look like my mother ,
but she &apos;s supposed to be waiting for me in the car .
it &apos;s a tragedy .
she &apos;s somebody &apos;s baby .
how do you do this every day ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna have a uni take you home .
it &apos;s senseless .
yes , it is . go on .
okay . okay . come on . come on . come on .
just stay right here , okay ?
right here . right here . did you know her ?
she &apos;s my best friend !
when was the last time you saw her ?
we had lunch yesterday at south campus ...
okay .
is there anybody you can think of
that would have reason to do this ?
did she have a boyfriend ?
she wasn &apos;t seeing anyone .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone !
i &apos;m sorry .
okay . all right .
第一季 第四集
no computer . somebody &apos;s got her laptop .
wonder what this opens ?
uh , her locker at the gym .
i &apos;m lucas bilton . i was danielle &apos;s r.a.
resident advisor . they look after kids in the dorm .
how well did you know her ?
not that well .
she ever come by and talk to you
about having a problem with anybody ?
she stopped by once or twice about classes .
she was usually either studying or playing soccer .
all right . here &apos;s my card .
if you think of anything , can you give me a call , please ?
i &apos;m danielle &apos;s father .
she wanted to get into bcu since she was a little kid .
the day she found out was the best day of her life .
when was the last time you spoke to your daughter ?
two days ago .
she , uh ,
she sounded pretty tired , but she had a lot on her plate .
straight @-@ a student . played division @-@ i soccer .
they recruited her . full scholarship .
you must have been very proud of her .
oh , her mother and i were very proud , yeah .
her mother died when she was 15 .
i didn &apos;t know how i was gonna be able to afford to send her .
she did it all herself .
would you like one of my officers to drive you home ?
yeah .
i just want you to find out who did this to my baby .
2 @-@ centimeter , singular gunshot wound , mid @-@ chest .
i bet we &apos;re looking for a 9 @-@ millimeter .
i &apos;ll have ballistics confirm . i just like to guess .
and i &apos;m usually right .
gunned down at one of the best universities in the country .
i loved every minute there .
well , maybe not protein biochemistry .
shooter was close .
i found a hair on her body .
give it to the crime lab .
see if they find dna .
well @-@ developed quadricep femoris .
yeah , she was a division @-@ i soccer player .
did you play sports ?
ballet and fencing .
those aren &apos;t sports .
yes , they are .
what did you play ?
field hockey . i was an attacker .
i &apos;m sure you were very aggressive .
&quot; attacker &quot; is a position .
maura ...
... she died from a gunshot wound to the chest .
since when is the chest bone connected to the ankle bone ?
the anterior inferior tibiofibular
syndesmotic ligament is ruptured .
sounds painful .
probably hurt her to walk .
it &apos;s an unusual injury .
you see it in professional athletes .
her doctors missed it . she needed surgery .
then how was she playing division @-@ i soccer ?
well , she wasn &apos;t .
she wasn &apos;t playing soccer on this ankle for a while .
so our scholar @-@ athlete was lying .
why ?
wow , she was a talented player .
danielle was my game girl ,
no attitude ,
hard worker .
was she having problems with any of the teamates ?
no , not that i know .
her biggest problem was high @-@ ankle sprain .
that actually was no sprain , it was torn ligament
no wonder she didn &apos;t respond to rehab .
could you tell us where her locker was ?
i would like to look inside .
not ours .
we have combo locks .
if you think of anything helpful ,
please give us a call . thanks .
yeah .
i really liked her .
killed me to have to pull her scholarship .
well , you cut her from the team when she got hurt ?
and pull her scholarship ?
my hands were tied .
well , they kick her out ?
no , the tution is paid off .
how was that possible ? her scholarship was pulled .
straight from the bursar &apos;s office .
paid it off herself in a lump sum .
w-- holy cr-- $ 57,000 a year ? !
includes room and board .
that should include a car .
that should include an all @-@ expense @-@ paid trip around the world .
hell of a lot of money to wear a toga and do jell @-@ o shots .
通常由床单做成 这种派对在美加的大学校园里很流行
right ?
where &apos;d you go to college , korsak ?
didn &apos;t .
watched &quot; animal house &quot; a few times .
course you did .
got someing , jane .
that was a good place to kill someone .
camera &apos;s blocked . our suspect knows the campus .
what about the security officer ?
barney fife ? clean . no record .
the cellphone company came back with danielle &apos;s texts .
all that money for school and that &apos;s how she writes ?
&quot; 2gtbt &quot; ?
&quot; too good to be true . &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; texting . &quot;
it &apos;s so complicated my mother does it in a nursing home !
i &apos;m looking at the pages ,
it looks like more than friend .
who &apos;s &quot; b @-@ bear &quot; ?
there &apos;s a lot of texts from this guy .
&quot; miss u . &quot; &quot; love u , babe . &quot;
&quot; call me . &quot;
&quot; b @-@ bear . &quot; brandon lewis .
sophomore .
now , why didn &apos;t natalie tell me
that danielle have a boyfriend ?
because they broke up a month ago .
why ?
he was stressing her .
what do you mean ?
she said she didn &apos;t have time for a boyfriend .
and how did he feel about that ?
brandon &apos;s a good guy ...
but ?
it was pretty sudden .
he was pissed .
i don &apos;t understand .
she had even less time when she was playing soccer .
how did you know she was cut from the team ?
how did you know ?
she told me .
she was really sad .
she said she felt like she lost herself .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
she didn &apos;t want her dad to know .
was she sad about breaking it off with brandon ?
ever since she got hurt playing soccer ,
she was sad about everything .
unh @-@ unh . boston homicide .
brandon lewis here ?
i thought this was a frat house .
it is .
we &apos;re getting ready for a party .
in the middle of the day ?
we just finished finals .
congratulations .
excuse us .
do you think their parents know
they &apos;re spending $ 1,000 an hour
for them to dress in foil ?
hi . can you get brandon lewis for us , please ?
thank you .
okay , w-- why are you wearing this ?
abc party .
anything but clothes ?
you brandon ?
yeah . is this about danielle ?
i &apos;m not some gangbanger .
i &apos;m pre @-@ law .
we &apos;ll try to keep that in mind .
when did you and danielle break up ?
she broke up with me a month ago .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
dig a little ...
... pre @-@ law .
must be teaching you some analytical skills .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
was she seeing someone else ?
no .
why ? do you know something ?
come on , brandon .
a girl that looked like danielle ,
they &apos;re not alone very long .
how would you feel if she was seeing someone else ?
really happy . what do you think ?
i think a man gets enraged
and he does things that he regrets .
i @-@ i &apos;m not some homicidal maniac !
i @-@ i loved her . why would i kill her ?
i don &apos;t know , brandon . why would you ?
you can &apos;t pin this on me .
i want a lawyer .
took him long enough .
is this from the good fridge or the dead @-@ people fridge ?
cold air is cold air .
how old is it ?
no , don &apos;t tell me .
i @-@ i &apos;m too hungry .
i was at bcu .
the sorority girls were dressed in foil .
the abc party .
such a rho zeta theta thing .
you take it for granted that you know all that .
well , i didn &apos;t know &quot; attacker &quot; was a position .
a gaping hole in your education .
i try not to have regrets ...
but , i don &apos;t know .
w @-@ when i was on that campus , i ...
i felt like i missed out .
jane , you &apos;re a bright , accomplished woman .
i peeked in the library .
all the things i could have known if i &apos;d gone to college .
something about being there was ...
it was inspiring , you know ?
but you know more about human beings than anyone i know .
bad human beings .
we &apos;re all a mix of good and bad .
hey , ma . what is it now ?
what is this ?
well , your father wouldn &apos;t help me , so i traded in my car .
were you semiconscious at the time ?
don &apos;t be condescending .
oh , wow .
it &apos;s a 429 @-@ cubic @-@ inch , uh , v @-@ 8 .
it &apos;s a very efficient engine for its time .
40 years ago .
i @-@ i @-@ is this about teaching papa some lesson ?
well , that ... may have been part of it .
smoke , uh , is leaking
from your valve @-@ cover gasket ,
but i @-@ i could replace that for you .
but i @-@ i do see some other problems .
you &apos;re burning oil .
i would suspect it &apos;s a ring job .
how much ?
uh , three , maybe four .
hundred ?
thousand .
oh !
oh , god . your father is gonna kill me .
tell him not to do it while i &apos;m on call .
can you help me get the buick back ?
they &apos;re crooks , and you &apos;re a police officer !
i &apos;m a homicide detective !
ma , wh-- are you planning on killing the car dealer ? !
i might .
is it driveable ?
maybe a few miles .
fine . let &apos;s call you a cab .
hey , hey .
ran down that barcode key
we found in danielle &apos;s dorm room .
you found something .
it opens a locker at a high @-@ end gym in somerville .
danielle stored a nice dress ...
and , uh ...
... some &quot; do @-@ me &quot; heels in a secret locker .
that was not her only secret .
i think i know how
our innocent sophomore made $ 57,000 .
she lost her scholorship
and when tuition was due , i &apos;m figuring
that danielle was turning tricks for no more than a month .
how &apos;d she put that kind of money together in a month ?
well , i mean , she &apos;d have to have some pretty high @-@ end clients .
come on . we &apos;re taking this .
a little undercover field trip to an expert .
a pimp ?
yeah , well , she had to be working with someone
to make that kind of cash , right ?
can i drive ?
yeah , knock yourself out .
maybe danielle had , like , a very rich sugar daddy .
maybe b @-@ bear found out why she didn &apos;t have time for him
and killed her .
i need me a little taste of this vanilla bitch right here .
how much for a party ?
three to five years .
oh , my bad .
but 5 @-@ 0 looking fine !
get out of here . uh @-@ huh .
leave it to my mother to trade her buick in for a pimp mobile .
okay , there &apos;s my expert .
he was a really good source
when i worked this sector .
maybe he can tell us
how danielle was hooking up with her johns .
hey , man .
oh , it &apos;s rizzoli .
who died ?
detective frost , this is mo monee .
your , uh ,
your ride needs work .
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s .
oh , damn . mama &apos;s got some gangsta .
she one of yours ?
i wish . girl like that could earn .
maybe she had a pimp .
maybe you could find out for us .
she was a college student .
man , it ain &apos;t like it used to be .
bitches be trippin &apos; now , gettin &apos; their own websites .
all kinds of amateurs up in this game .
maybe she was solo .
no , if she was working regular ,
she had herself a daddy .
and a book .
you check her book ?
we didn &apos;t find one .
she had a book .
i mean , this whole damn world &apos;s gone crazy ,
but whores still need to keep schedule .
hello .
you &apos;ve got a great eye .
this one &apos;s in tip @-@ top ...
okay , what &apos;s this about ?
that is your car .
this is my mother &apos;s car .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that .
that lemon that you sold her
needs thousands of dollars of work .
according to the law , we &apos;re not responsible
for abuse , negligence , or accident
once the car leaves our lot .
right , the law .
how about you showing me all your 140 @-@ 58 documents
that shows that you have the bonds for all these cars ?
also , let &apos;s get out your titles
so we can verify the vin numbers .
what do you say , uh , roger ?
we want all our customers to have a satisfactory experience .
i &apos;m sure we could rescind the sale .
throw in a new alternator , all right ?
i don &apos;t think that will be a problem .
and floor mats .
it &apos;ll be our pleasure .
i didn &apos;t think that you talked like that to anybody but me .
is that mom @-@ speak for &quot; thank you &quot; ?
dr. maura isles , knuckle @-@ deep
in germy bar snacks ?
i &apos;m shocked .
oh , i had representative samples tested .
bacteria count fell within acceptable limits .
you want one ?
it must be very complicated to be you .
you have no idea .
i had to get out of the office .
me too .
i feel guilty taking a break . we don &apos;t have a solid lead .
we might .
i got the lab results back
from that hair sample i found on danielle .
it &apos;s synthetic . from a toupee .
danielle was selling herself to a guy with a plastic rug ?
maybe he took it off , you know , during .
god , a child at the college of her dreams ,
and she &apos;s turning tricks .
to stay . you know , she lost her scholarship .
she was trying to pay for school .
how about a loan ? hell , some people even flip burgers .
not possible .
why ?
because there are only 8,760 hours in a year ,
and to pay for school ,
she needed to work 9,500 hours .
you &apos;re defending her .
your fancy french boarding school warped your young mind .
in europe , women make all kinds of arrangements with men .
and both parties get what they need .
no shame ,
no pimps , no victims .
i &apos;m sure it was terrible for danielle to resort to that .
she had other choices .
apparently she didn &apos;t think so .
she couldn &apos;t go to her father .
jane , what is it ?
you &apos;re right .
h @-@ her father was very upset that he couldn &apos;t
keep her in that school without that scholarship .
you know that piece of plastic
you found at the crime scene ?
it &apos;s acrylonitrile butadiene styrene .
from a computer .
danielle &apos;s missing laptop .
i bet the person who stole it dropped it .
and i bet the campus computer store can tell us who that is .
wait , what are you gonna do ?
sit outside and wait for it to open ?
yeah , i might . i &apos;ll see you later .
anybody bring in a laptop for repairs
within the past 24 hours ?
uh , yeah .
can i see the repair slips , please ?
that &apos;s this morning &apos;s .
you need yesterday &apos;s , too ?
yes , please .
hey , officer kelly .
get him ! get him ! get him !
don &apos;t run from the cops !
oh , look at this .
laptop @-@ repair slip .
you want to bet it &apos;s danielle &apos;s ?
i didn &apos;t kill her .
you had her laptop .
i found it .
after you killed her .
she was dead when i got there .
i grabbed it , put it in the cruiser ,
and then i went to call it in .
so your only crime is stealing from the dead girl ?
look ...
it stinks that she &apos;s dead .
but she &apos;s not gonna miss the laptop , right ?
you &apos;re gonna miss your bed .
take him to lockup .
cheez doodles or chewy bears ?
so hard to choose .
you better have the protein bar , detective .
thanks a lot .
you told me to remind you .
i think i found danielle &apos;s hooker book .
it &apos;s on her laptop .
that &apos;s her calendar . see all these entries ?
i think they &apos;re code for johns she was meeting .
uh , that looks like a college student making notes to herself .
except she wasn &apos;t taking art history .
i don &apos;t know . m @-@ maybe he &apos;s right .
look , she , uh , she records historical dates ,
but always as &quot; 1700 , &quot; &quot; 1800 . &quot;
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s military time .
look at this one -- &quot; 2100 . &quot;
she was probably taking &quot; future u.s. history , &quot;
right , korsak ?
her texts to brandon stopped about a month ago .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s right when these entries begin .
look at this .
the night before she died ...
&quot; windgate act passed by ah , 2100 . &quot;
yeah , there &apos;s a windgate hotel downtown .
maybe ah stayed there .
wild @-@ goose chase , you ask me .
no one &apos;s asking you . i &apos;ll go , jane .
okay .
hotel @-@ security footage .
that him ? the bad rug ?
wild @-@ goose chase , huh , korsak ?
didn &apos;t find anything .
oh , except ...
... one of danielle &apos;s johns .
but we &apos;re probably not interested
in the guy she was with the day she was murdered .
all right , you &apos;ve had your fun .
i was wrong , okay ? so , sue me .
&quot; ah &quot; is professor andrew hilliard ?
hilliard sold his house in cambridge last month .
been renting cheap , school @-@ owned housing
for the past few months .
sold his house ?
you think danielle was shaking him down for tuition money ?
like she &apos;s trying to wipe away what she &apos;d become .
tell rizzoli .
she &apos;ll be delighted to get this creep .
professor hilliard .
boston p.d. we &apos;re coming in .
we got a deco .
smells a lot like day two .
you gonna hurl again ?
you want me to kiss him on the lips ?
glock 26 .
it &apos;s the same gun that got danielle .
serial numbers are filed .
why did he kill danielle ? jealousy ?
maybe .
then he kills himself &apos; cause he can &apos;t live with what he did .
except ...
except ?
except it &apos;s a setup .
hardly any blood on his gun hand .
yeah , there &apos;s none on the slide either .
this isn &apos;t a suicide .
hi . i &apos;m going to the crime lab .
i &apos;ll ride with you .
maura measured the entrance and the exit wounds .
hilliard didn &apos;t kill himself .
he was shot by somebody right next to him .
his broker confirmed
hilliard &apos;s been withdrawing $ 15,000 a month .
that &apos;s $ 180,000 -- for what ?
no idea .
but it &apos;s been going on for a year and a half .
so , the professor starts seeing student prostitutes ...
and somebody starts blackmailing him .
yeah , but i @-@ it couldn &apos;t have been danielle .
she &apos;d been a scholarship soccer player up until the last month .
striations match .
same gun killed danielle and hilliard .
tracing this gun is our best hope of finding the shooter .
how ?
serial numbers were filed off .
just because your bright , shiny objects can &apos;t do it
doesn &apos;t mean it can &apos;t be done .
hey , maura .
let &apos;s get to the university .
danielle &apos;s friends are throwing her a candlelight vigil .
i want to get there early , all right ?
oh , i &apos;d like to come with you , pay my respects ,
maybe help you look for the bad guy .
they like to see the results of their work .
i know because i had two years of forensic psychiatry .
it took you two years
to figure out that bad guys were screwed up ?
it &apos;s beautiful ... in a sad way .
just keep looking at faces .
hello , detective .
some turnout , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s a tribute to the kind of person your daughter was .
we are doing our best . i promise .
thanks .
excuse me .
you got something ?
yeah . the numbers off the gun .
it &apos;s registered to scott bilton ,
wilkes @-@ barre , pennsylvania .
bilton ?
lucas , the r.a. , bilton ?
his stepfather .
be careful . he &apos;s got three other guns registered .
okay . thanks .
murder weapon &apos;s traced to the r.a.
that kid &apos;s the killer ?
of course -- r.a.s keep tabs on their floors .
and he would know that she lost her scholarship ,
that she was desperate .
looks like his part @-@ time job was pimping .
let &apos;s wait till this thing is over .
we &apos;ll get him when he &apos;s alone , okay ?
maura , stay here .
okay .
look at the bracelet . it &apos;s the same as danielle &apos;s .
natalie was hooking , too .
i loved danielle .
anything i can say about this remarkable person
won &apos;t come close to describing who she was .
gun !
drop it !
you killed danielle !
she couldn &apos;t keep her mouth shut .
don &apos;t think i won &apos;t kill you , too .
please .
jane , go ! i got her !
that &apos;s ok , that &apos;s ok , i &apos;m here
lucas !
she was a whore , and she was a whiner !
i gave her 57 grand , and she didn &apos;t want to do it anymore ? !
you work it off , bitch !
just put the gun down ! we can talk about this !
or i &apos;ll just blow your head off .
he &apos;s running !
frost .
i &apos;m with you .
well ... good to see you with your eyes open .
it &apos;s good to be going home .
how you feeling ?
eh , my ribs are a little sore .
bullet was a &quot; through and through . &quot;
it &apos;s better than most case scenarios .
i know .
bullet broke two ribs , came right back out .
i guess i passed out from shock .
it just hurts to laugh or cough .
well , at least you &apos;ll have a cool scar .
doctor said just two pucker marks .
oh , good . so then you can continue to wear foil bikinis .
don &apos;t make me laugh .
sorry .
here . these are for you .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
let &apos;s get you out of here .
are you gonna tell my parents ?
that you got shot ?
well , i think they already know .
thank you .
i was really desperate , and ...
and it was really stupid .
well , everybody does stupid things .
that stupid ?
okay , no . maybe not that stupid .
but you &apos;re here .
and you get a second chance .
when do you go back to school ?
i don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t pay .
and i can &apos;t do what i was doing ....
... ever .
oh . here .
what &apos;s this ?
open it .
weird , huh ?
i talked to the bursar &apos;s office .
they said you were paid all the way up to your senior year .
how -- but --
there &apos;s always a little
leftover scholarship money for hardship cases .
i argued that your case was a major hardship .
thank you .
you study hard , okay ?
yeah .
see you soon . take care .
so , what was it like working on a live victim ?
terrifying .
and exhilarating .
natalie confirmed your theory though .
lucas had about a half @-@ dozen girls working off tuition .
yeah . lucas was the company store .
fronted the money to danielle .
maybe she found out that he was blackmailing the professor ,
and he killed her .
yeah . she probably thought she could get out
if she threatened to go public .
that poor father . what he must be going through .
i applied to bcu .
it &apos;s very hard to get into .
i got in .
why didn &apos;t you go ?
wanted to be a cop .
what &apos;s the real reason ?
my father would have sold everything to send me there .
