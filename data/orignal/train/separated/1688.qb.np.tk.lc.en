ma , ma , calm down .
listen to me .
i know it says click with the mouse ,
but on a laptop , the trackpad is the mouse .
now , put your finger on it .
doesn &apos;t matter which finger .
good choice .
now move it down to your e @-@ mail icon .
yeah , the little envelope .
what do you mean , &quot; what does it look like ? &quot;
it looks like an envelope !
fine , you don &apos;t like the computer ,
don &apos;t use it !
sure , we can exchange it for a salad spinner . good @-@ bye !
that &apos;s a hanukkah present you &apos;re regretting , huh ?
i won &apos;t say that all senior citizens
who can &apos;t master technology should be publicly flogged ,
but if we made an example of one or two ,
it might give the others incentive to try harder .
i had a great idea .
you know how we &apos;re always having
to stop and solve differential equations ,
like when you &apos;re doing fourier analysis ,
or using the schr dinger equation ?
howard doesn &apos;t . he &apos;s only an engineer .
i was thinking , we could write a little app
that would use handwriting recognition ,
and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine .
you just use your smartphone ,
take a picture of the equation and bam !
you know what &apos;s a great app ? the one that makes fart noises .
you know , leonard ,
that &apos;s actually a valid idea .
very good .
can you say that and not make it sound like i &apos;m a cat
who learned how to use the toilet ?
no .
the two achievements are equally surprising
and equally admirable ,
though if pressed ,
i &apos;d have to give a slight edge to the cat .
i &apos;ll save you the pain and nervousness
of waiting for the answer .
i agree to be part of your project . congratulations .
oh , yay for me .
what about you guys ?
i can &apos;t promise anything ,
but people do make money off stuff like this .
a few extra bucks would be nice .
i could finally move out of my mother &apos;s house .
where would you go ?
i always dreamed about
building a little place of my own over the garage
you know , if i made more money , i could take time off from work
and give pretty girls submarine rides .
what &apos;s that ?
some weird sex thing ?
no .
you take pretty girls underwater
in your private submarine , and you show them fish .
why does everything have to be dirty with you ?
i was thinking we could work on this at night ,
and then maybe in a couple of weeks ,
we &apos;ll have ourselves an app to sell .
sounds like we &apos;re in business .
i think we should take a picture to capture this moment .
yeah .
oh !
was that the best 99 cents i ever spent , or what ?
i checked the app store .
no one is doing
handwriting @-@ recognition differential equation solving .
oh , dear lord , shush .
what ?
you have so few good ideas , leonard .
and you &apos;re just going to spill the beans
in front of an outsider ?
who , me ?
sheldon , i don &apos;t think penny cares
about handwriting @-@ recognition based differential ...
* the stars at night are big and bright *
* deep in the heart of texas *
she &apos;s not going to steal our idea .
what idea ?
we &apos;re gonna write an application ...
* the prairie sky is wide and high *
* deep in the heart ... *
okay , stop , stop !
* of texas *
whatever your secret is ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s boring , so i &apos;m not interested .
it &apos;s not boring at all .
you see , in higher order mathematics ,
there are certain sets
of equations that ...
bored .
satisfied ?
hardly .
consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario .
a young woman alone in the big city .
her ridiculous dream
of becoming an actress lies shattered about her .
hey , wait a minute .
well , hang on . let &apos;s see where he &apos;s going .
then it hits her .
how is she going to survive ?
i mean , she has no prospects , no marketable skills .
and then one day ,
she meets a group of geniuses
and their friend howard .
hey , i ...
hang on . let &apos;s see where he &apos;s going .
she befriends them , and then lies in wait
until they reveal a marketable idea ,
which she steals and sells to the highest bidder .
that is ridiculous .
oh , is it ?
let &apos;s see you come up with an explanation
as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time .
oh , great . you know what ?
i &apos;ve already mooched dinner off you guys .
i don &apos;t need to listen to this .
there &apos;s your answer-- free food .
all right , i &apos;ve taken the liberty
of drafting these workflow charts
which outline our various duties and the path we will follow
as we develop our ground @-@ breaking new app .
hey , why am i in charge of phone support ?
seems a bit racist .
a customer service representative
with an indian accent will create the impression
we &apos;re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centers .
oh .
very clever .
but still racist .
duly noted , steve from wichita .
why am i listed as your executive assistant ?
because the word &quot; secretary &quot; has fallen into disrepute .
fyi , my mother &apos;s birthday is coming up .
i &apos;m going to need you to pick up a present .
okay , we need to stop for a minute .
leonard , please , we can talk during our break .
we have one coming up at midnight .
we &apos;ll need snacks .
sheldon , you &apos;re not in charge .
it &apos;s my idea . i &apos;m in charge .
oh , of course you are .
look at the organizational chart .
you &apos;re clearly listed as founder .
well , yes , and you &apos;re listed as chief executive officer ,
chief financial officer and chief operating officer .
you missed chief science officer ,
chairman of the board , and head of the secret santa committee .
okay .
you need to get clear on this right now .
i am in charge of this project .
ooh . leonard &apos;s going all alpha nerd on sheldon &apos;s ass ...
all right . all right , i &apos;m not going to argue with you .
sheldon cooper is nothing if not a team player .
dr. hofstadter , you have the conn .
thank you .
i thought we might start by talking about the user interface .
oh , dear lord , we &apos;re doomed .
so this button here
will allow you to scan a new equation ,
but over here , you can press this ,
and just substitute new values for the coefficients .
good one , boss .
what ?
this diagram .
i assume you were opening with a joke .
it certainly buoyed up this employee &apos;s esprit de corps .
it &apos;s not a joke . it &apos;s the real design .
in that case , may i offer 27 little tweaks
to make it slightly less embarrassing ?
sheldon , i think this will work .
let &apos;s just try it my way .
oh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i assumed that you wanted
candid truth @-@ telling from your employees ,
but i realize now , you want the mindless nattering
of complacent yes @-@ men .
are you done ?
if you say so , boss .
so right now , this button @-@ press event
is just triggering a dummy procedure call ...
how about this for the app name ?
the surprisingly helpful equation @-@ linked
differential optimized numerator .
so it spells &quot; sheldon . &quot;
does it ?
a happy accident .
we &apos;re not doing names now . howard ?
like i was saying , right now it &apos;s just a dummy procedure ,
but eventually , it will drop us into ...
all right , fine . if we &apos;re not going to give it a name ,
can we at least give it a secret code designation ?
no .
hear me out .
the atomic bomb was the manhattan project .
windows 95 was originally project chicago .
for our app , i would humbly suggest project nodlehs .
that &apos;s just &quot; sheldon &quot; backwards .
another happy accident .
we &apos;re not wasting time with names right now .
i see .
is that decision open for discussion ?
no .
is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion ?
no .
again ,
right now it &apos;s just a dummy procedure ,
but eventually , it will drop us into ...
i call for a vote of no confidence
and an immediate change in leadership .
sheldon , stop it .
when in the course of human events , it becomes necessary
to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together ...
that &apos;s enough , sheldon .
all right , let &apos;s get right to the vote .
show of hands-- all those opposed
to leonard and his reign of tyranny .
okay , that &apos;s it , you &apos;re fired .
really ?
why ?
because you &apos;re impossible to work with .
i see .
and is that open for discussion ?
what are you doing ?
oh . good morning , shoemaker .
i think you &apos;ll be pleased
with what the elves were up to last night .
i fired you .
oh , i know . i &apos;m now an independent contractor .
no , you are now nothing .
you have no connection to this project whatsoever .
but i made it better .
i don &apos;t want it better . i want it my way .
well , that speaks volumes , doesn &apos;t it ?
all right , i suppose i &apos;ll go put on my bus pants .
what the hell are bus pants ?
they are pants one wears over one &apos;s regular pants
when one sits on bus seats
that other people have previously sat on .
but perhaps from your lofty heights
atop the corporate ladder , you &apos;ve lost touch
with the struggles of the common man .
look , i &apos;m still happy to drive you to work .
nothing &apos;s changed in that regard .
we &apos;re still roommates , we &apos;re still friends .
except you identified me , your best friend ,
as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed
from the organism and tossed away .
the desperate act of a little man
with a big napoleon complex .
you know what ?
go put on your bus pants .
mm . last night , i had a dream
we got so rich from the app ,
you and i bought matching side @-@ by @-@ side mansions .
but ...
there was a secret tunnel
connecting your front yard to my back yard .
what do you think that means ?
it means after we play handball , i &apos;m showering at home .
good morning , friend howard .
friend raj .
i see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages .
perhaps they would taste better out of these .
&quot; world &apos;s greatest astrophysicist &quot; ?
don &apos;t thank me . you earned it .
&quot; howard wolowitz . &quot;
why not &quot; world &apos;s greatest engineer &quot; ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i typed that into the label maker ,
but i just couldn &apos;t press enter .
now down to business .
what would it take for you to abandon leonard
and join me in a rival company ?
unless , of course , the mugs are sufficient ,
in which case , welcome aboard .
we &apos;re not quitting on leonard .
i understand . your loyalty is admirable .
but what if i were to up the ante ?
what are you talking about ?
monogrammed key chains
with a built @-@ in laser pointer .
no ?
how about can cozies
emblazoned with our university mascot ?
go , beavers .
i &apos;ll be back .
okay , let &apos;s try this one .
&quot; spherical hankel function . &quot;
hold on .
that &apos;s it !
eureka !
hey , we agreed when it was &quot; eureka &quot; time ,
we were all gonna say it together .
fine . let &apos;s say it together .
no . the moment has passed .
greetings , gentlemen .
how goes your little project ?
you mean , &quot; project lenwoloppali &quot; ?
ah , a combination of all your names .
very clever .
i assume &quot; koothranardowitz &quot; was taken ?
we &apos;re actually scanning equations and getting good results .
oh , well then , by all means , carry on .
i wouldn &apos;t want to impede your progress .
howard , did you solve the install time problem yet ?
no . it &apos;s a little tricky .
i &apos;m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dyn ...
what are you doing ? !
playing the theremin .
no . i mean , what are you doing with a theremin ?
playing it .
i &apos;ve loved the theremin from the first moment
i heard the original star trek theme .
and it &apos;s been killing me
that it just sits in my closet , gathering dust .
sheldon ! we &apos;re working here !
that &apos;s all right .
i can barely hear you over my theremin .
well , that was a little uncalled for .
no , that was completely called for . we need quiet .
so , your project is more important than mine ?
well , seeing as your project is to sabotage my project , yes .
don &apos;t beat around the bush , leonard .
if you don &apos;t want me here ,
just say the word , and i &apos;ll leave .
could have beaten around the bush a little .
nobody knows
the trouble i &apos;ve seen
nobody knows my sorrow ?
what you doing ?
trying to contact your home planet ?
i &apos;m practicing my theremin .
nobody knows
the trouble i &apos;ve seen
glory , hallelujah .
something got you down , there , sheldon ?
leonard kicked me out of my own apartment .
and his app team .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry .
he wouldn &apos;t drive me to work today .
i had to wear my bus pants .
is that so ?
yes .
and they &apos;re still sticky .
probably going to have to throw them away .
hey , you don &apos;t need leonard and his app .
you can make one with me .
with you ?
seriously , i have a great idea for one .
is it better than your idea to move to los angeles
and become a famous actress ?
okay , look ...
when you see someone wearing shoes you like ,
you just snap a picture of them ,
and the app goes on the internet
to find out where you can buy them .
that &apos;s your app idea ?
well , you don &apos;t like it ?
i didn &apos;t say that . but no , i don &apos;t .
why not ?
oh , penny , where do i begin ?
the simple @-@ mindedness of your idea
is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality .
and leonard didn &apos;t want to work with you ?
imagine that .
i know , it &apos;s baffling .
nobody knows
the trouble i &apos;ve seen ...
sheldon , i &apos;m gonna make some cocoa .
do you want some ?
do you make it with milk or water ?
milk .
real cocoa ?
that &apos;s what it says on the packet .
do you have those little marshmallows ?
no , sorry .
well , i suppose it &apos;s appropriate .
what does that mean ?
a disappointing drink for a disappointing day .
hey , look at this .
20 people from the university have already signed up
for our private beta .
i &apos;m telling you ,
the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner
meets a real need . we &apos;ve got a hit .
what do you think we should sell it for ?
well , based on the fact that our potential market
is about 70 or 80 guys ,
and you want a submarine ,
i &apos;d say about a million dollars a pop .
well , what if we put out a lite version for half a million ?
you know , get the word of mouth going .
hi . i &apos;m sorry to bother you guys ,
but you &apos;ve got to come take your sheldon back .
what &apos;s he doing in your apartment ?
well , he was moping down in the lobby , so i invited him over .
now i regret it .
why do you regret ... uh , never mind , stupid question .
look , can &apos;t you just let him play with you until bedtime ?
we &apos;re not playing .
this is real work .
we &apos;re going to be hundred @-@ aires .
okay . what if i got him to apologize and promise to behave ?
then i guess we would let him back on the app team ,
and while we &apos;re doing that , you could take an aerial tour
of l.a. on your flying pig .
okay . wait right here .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing . if i get rich enough ,
that &apos;s the kind of girl i want to take
on a submarine ride .
and yes , that time , i meant it to be dirty .
really ?
leonard wants me back ?
oh , yes . he says they are lost without you .
well , we sure saw that coming .
that &apos;s right .
you know what i &apos;m going to do ?
i am going to sit here and just let them stew .
no , no , no . you know ,
they have suffered enough .
everybody &apos;s suffered enough .
the thing is , you &apos;re going to have to offer him
a face @-@ saving way out of this .
how ?
say you &apos;re sorry .
oh , no .
mrs. mary cooper didn &apos;t raise her no liars .
okay . um ...
how about this ? you know how you &apos;re always trying
to learn about sarcasm ?
no .
no ?
i was being sarcastic .
oh . good for you .
so all you have to do here is say
you &apos;re sorry to leonard ,
but say it sarcastically .
of course .
he will hear it as an attempt to mend fences ,
as opposed to the withering condemnation
you and i will know it to be .
yeah . yeah , that was my plan .
all right . come on . let &apos;s go .
oh , by the way , thank you
for the delicious cocoa .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
boy , i &apos;m getting good at this .
okay , now that you &apos;re back on the team ,
let &apos;s get you caught up .
before you begin , let me say again
how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behavior
and how much i respect and admire your leadership .
thank you .
so as you can see ,
not only can you store your favorite equations ,
but you can forward them to your friends
or post them on facebook right from the app .
well , i must say , i am impressed .
thanks .
you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work .
we have .
as a result , you have taken
the most important step on the road to success :
learning what not to do .
now , let &apos;s start fresh .
howard , we &apos;re going to need some tea .
okay , these are uggs .
these are crocs .
these are knockoff manolo blahniks .
bored .
look , you said it yourself , we have to create a database
before you can write an alga @-@ thingy .
algorithm .
you see , penny , alan turing defined an algorithm ...
bored .
okay .
these are steve maddens .
these are nine west .
these are target . oh , but don &apos;t they look like chanel ?
these are michael kors ...
nobody knows ...
the trouble i &apos;ve seen
nobody knows ...
