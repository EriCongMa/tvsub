what is this ?
little snacks for thought for me to take home ?
l haven &apos;t pushed you enough to confront these things .
somewhere along the line , l became frightened of you .
frightened ?
maybe l should &apos;ve seen that in the beginning .
maybe , baby .
rage , anthony . . .

. . .from feelings that are even more frightening .
what feelings might those be ?
sadness .
you go off on a racist rant about lndian food . . .
