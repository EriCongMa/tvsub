i hear you &apos;re interviewing replacements this morning .
i am .
you good at what you do ?
i &apos;m great at what i do .
then you start tomorrow .
i &apos;d like to propose a change
to the current compensation formula .
how many partners do you have in your pocket
if we put your proposal to a vote ?
i can get 45 % .
i &apos;m gonna get you the difference .
this is harvey &apos;s last three income statements ,
and i found them sitting in the copy machine .
you came to work for me , so now it &apos;s time for you to decide .
are you with me or not ?
i just called for a vote ,
and i hope you &apos;ve been saving your money ,
because your gravy train &apos;s about to leave the station .
okay , i &apos;m dialing 911 .
it &apos;s not a heart attack .
it &apos;s a panic attack .
remember when i said if i wanted you to make up
for the compensation vote i would come to you directly ?
well , now i am .
well , let &apos;s take a look at your resume .
witness tampering , extortion , bribery .
forgery fits right in .
i actually looked into your mommy ,
and it turns out that the whole time
you were home with daddy , mommy was out banging--
hey , harv . how &apos;s it going ?
you &apos;re absolutely certain the man
was this travis tanner person ?
yes .
and yet you &apos;re just as certain the woman wasn &apos;t donna ?
that &apos;s what i said .
i know that , but you haven &apos;t said who she was .
why are you looking at me like that ?
you know why .
i don &apos;t know who she was .
okay , then let &apos;s try this .
why do you think travis tanner all of a sudden
popped into your subconscious ?
because i &apos;m in the middle of a case against him .
well , since you don &apos;t want to talk about the dream anymore ,
why don &apos;t we talk about the case ?
that &apos;s not creepy at all .
i was just wondering why you changed your hair .
hair &apos;s the same as it &apos;s always been .
you trying to look older ? younger ?
whatever it is , it isn &apos;t working .
are you finished ? &apos; cause i &apos;m actually trying
to catch up on some billables here .
hey , i just stopped by to give you a little gift
for winning the zane case .
a gift ? you &apos;ve never given me a gift after a case .
that &apos;s not true .
come to think of it , you &apos;ve never even congratulated me ,
which means you &apos;re actually here because ,
oh , my god , you miss me .
i did ... not miss you .
are you okay ?
do you want to come over tonight ?
we can watch sleepless in seattle .
do you want your gift or not ?
that &apos;s it ?
my gift looks a lot like a folder .
it &apos;s a case .
you and me killing it against travis tanner .
just like old times ?
just like old times .
well , what are we waiting for ?
nothing .
he &apos;s on his way over with a settlement offer right now .
settlement ? that doesn &apos;t sound like tanner .
sounds exactly like tanner .
how &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s starting off waving a white flag .
yeah , he &apos;s doing it just to go behind our backs
so he can attack our flank .
so you &apos;re saying we need to watch our flank .
no , i &apos;m saying we need to attack his .
what ?
i &apos;m just gonna say it .
every time we go up against tanner , it gets brutal .
you just had a panic attack the other day ,
so are you sure this is really what you need right now ?
it &apos;s exactly what i need right now .
let &apos;s go get him .
louis ? what &apos;s this ?
that is a token of my appreciation .
you told me to trust harvey with esther and you were right .
now harvey and i are good .
well , if you &apos;re gonna give me a gift
every time i turn out to be right ,
then i &apos;m gonna need a bigger apartment .
well , not every time , but this time .
your mud club . i &apos;m going mudding ?
even better .
we are going mudding .
wow , louis . i don &apos;t know what to say .
this is , um ....
wonderful ?
inappropriate .
oh , come on , donna .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
picture this .
you and me , side by side , completely naked ,
our bodies covered in the juices of mother earth .
oh , yeah , now i can see exactly how it &apos;s totally appropriate .
exactly .
and donna , trust me .
when you dip your virgin toe in the deep warmth of my mud ,
you &apos;re never gonna be the same again .
jessica , we have a problem .
i went through the bylaws .
turns out the new compensation structure is in violation
of subsection c35 .
so the vote in itself is moot .
so you &apos;re saying we &apos;re going back
to the old compensation structure ?
no , i &apos;m not saying that . subsection c35 is saying that .
there &apos;s only one problem .
subsection c35 didn &apos;t exist 24 hours ago .
jessica--
cut the shit , louis .
tell me what this is really about .
it &apos;s about me trying to make things right with harvey .
and i have no problem with that .
but i also need you to make things right with me .
what are you talking about ?
that vote was an assault on my power .
i sneak this by ,
i don &apos;t get my power back .
it just makes me the same as you and jack .
so you &apos;re not going to undo this thing
the same shady way that the two of you
passed it in the first place .
jessica , i told you ,
leaving harvey &apos;s compensation in the copier
was an accident .
and a man named santa claus climbs down chimneys
and leaves presents under trees .
okay , fine , i get it .
you don &apos;t believe me .
but how the hell am i supposed to convince the senior partners
to take money out of their own pockets ?
that &apos;s your problem .
you want to reverse that policy , bring it up for a vote .
like a man .
excuse me , tiger .
don &apos;t you want to check in at reception ?
oh , i know where i &apos;m going .
no , you don &apos;t .
yeah , i &apos;d say you know who i am , but you &apos;re not donna .
no , i &apos;m not . but i do know who you are .
well , then you know who i &apos;m here to see .
i also know that the very first time you ever came here ,
you walked right past security and by donna .
but like you just said , i &apos;m not donna .
i like you . you filling in for the day ?
none of your business .
hey , i &apos;m just saying , when red gets back ,
maybe you want to come work for me .
i already have a job .
and right now it &apos;s getting your sorry ass
into the conference room .
so what are you gonna do ?
the only thing i can do .
get harvey to ask me for something else .
no , not an option .
donna , the only way i can get this done
is with jack soloff &apos;s help ,
and there is no way that he &apos;s gonna reverse
the very same proposal that put him on the map .
i &apos;ll tell you what harvey would do .
i don &apos;t care what harvey would do ,
because i cannot do what harvey would do .
what would harvey do ?
he &apos;d find a way to make it worth jack &apos;s while .
get rachel to get me a list of every major corporate merger
pending in the next month .
there is the louis i came to work for .
you are right . here i am . and i &apos;m gonna get it done .
and when i do ,
you and i are going for a long , slow mud .
no , we &apos;re not .
if you &apos;re here to check the air ,
it &apos;s like a sauna on the 38th floor .
good to see you , harvey .
nice to know some people never change .
no witty rejoinder ? what &apos;s going on ?
you slowing down in your old age ?
could be low t.
and i could talk shit with you guys all day ,
but i &apos;m here because i care about my client .
well , then maybe your client shouldn &apos;t have tried
to launch a company with stolen ip .
that ip wasn &apos;t stolen .
alyssa created it herself .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether she created it or not .
she signed a contract that says we own it ,
and it was on our laptop that she took home
on her last day .
and we &apos;re not letting you walk out the door with our property .
okay , i told you this isn &apos;t about me .
okay , what do you want , tanner ?
i want to make an offer .
alyssa is willing to give you a 15 % stake
to drop this whole thing .
she could make it 100 % for all i care .
we &apos;re not settling .
you don &apos;t have to settle ,
but you do have to present that offer to your client
and you know it .
i will , i just need to get it translated
from bullshit to english .
harvey , look at me . that &apos;s a fair offer .
no , you look at me and tell me
and tell me you &apos;re not doing something behind our backs right now .
i &apos;m not .
well , we are .
your secretary said you wouldn &apos;t file a tro
until after this meeting .
oh , we didn &apos;t .
turns out that miss lang has some outstanding debts ,
so we just went ahead and bought those up
and put a lien on her property .
the sheriff &apos;s padlocking her offices as we speak .
harvey , don &apos;t do this . you &apos;ll be sorry .
tell that to the judge .
we &apos;re filing that tro in the morning .
i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m not the guy i used to be ,
but if you hit me ,
i &apos;m not turning the other cheek .
you &apos;re gonna get hit back .
what are you so happy about ?
i told you , it &apos;s exactly what i needed .
you &apos;ve gone up against this man how many times ?
enough to know that he &apos;s a piece of shit
that &apos;ll cross whatever line it takes to win .
all i &apos;ve heard so far is the line that you crossed .
listen , you may understand some things about people ,
but you don &apos;t understand what i do .
well , it sounds to me like what you did was attack a man
that was waving a white flag .
were you listening ?
he wasn &apos;t waving a white flag , he was setting us up .
how can you be so sure ?
because i know tanner .
okay , well , if you know so well what he was capable of ,
why was it such a good idea to pick a fight with him ?
because it &apos;s what i do .
well , maybe it &apos;s time to consider changing what you do .
okay , here we go .
what about gentech and orion pharmaceuticals ?
monster merger , contingent fee , and huge upside .
and cravath is listed as the attorney of record ,
which means if they swap out , it blows the whole thing up .
okay , well , that &apos;s the last one .
shit .
wait , this has been here the whole time .
what about john dellmore ?
they &apos;re merging with arkin financial .
haven &apos;t been announced yet , it &apos;s just sitting there
ripe for the taking .
no , not gonna happen .
dellmore &apos;s been with harmon and shupe for decades .
so what ? harmon and shupe is a third @-@ tier law firm
and shupe is a joke .
she &apos;s also john dellmore &apos;s wife .
well , so then maybe we can convince dellmore
that his wife is a trollop .
louis !
god damn it !
what is going on ?
i need jack soloff to overturn the compensation vote ,
and the only way for me to do that is to bring in
a big contingent client .
and share the money with him .
exactly ! and none of these people are it .
okay .
wait , where are you going ?
like you said , none of these people are it .
it &apos;s late , we &apos;re both exhausted ,
and i &apos;ve got a test in the morning .
rachel , please .
louis , i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ll work on it tomorrow morning , i promise .
rach--
gentlemen , i don &apos;t like granting tros without a good reason .
we have a good reason , your honor .
it &apos;s called a contract .
a contract that explicitly states that any product
alyssa lang developed during her employment
is the property of our client .
unfortunately that contract is unenforceable .
it is unless i woke up in russia this morning .
your honor , i have here a copy
of alyssa lang &apos;s birth certificate .
she may have signed that contract ,
but it isn &apos;t binding because she was only 16 at the time .
what ?
your honor , i know this man ,
and that document could have come from anywhere .
get it verified by the labs at quantico .
all it &apos;s gonna prove is that alyssa lang
had no legal capacity to sign .
it doesn &apos;t matter how old she was when she signed it .
it was ten years ago .
she &apos;s cashed every paycheck she got since .
and you can argue that at trial ,
but we have laws protecting minors for a reason ,
and i &apos;m not granting a tro .
and one more thing , your honor .
we have payment in full , discharging her debt ,
and are requesting her doors be reopened .
that has nothing to do with why we &apos;re here .
save it for trial , mr. specter . it &apos;s lunch .
i &apos;m hungry , and those padlocks are coming off today .
what the hell was that ?
that was the sound of your face hitting the canvas .
i suggest you stay down .
i &apos;m not staying anywhere , you son of a bitch .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
your client was 16 years old
and you conveniently left that out
of your changed man speech .
i didn &apos;t tell you about her because i knew
you wouldn &apos;t listen to a thing i said
after i offered you a fair deal
and you told me to go to hell .
bullshit . you didn &apos;t tell us because
you wanted to blindside us in court .
hey , you &apos;re the one who turned out the lights out on alyssa &apos;s business
while i was extending an olive branch .
bullshit again .
we both know that settlement offer
was nothing but a distraction .
you want a distraction ?
that is a draft of alyssa lang &apos;s
sexual harassment complaint against your client .
as far as our offer goes , it wasn &apos;t a distraction
because we haven &apos;t filed that yet
and our offer &apos;s still on the table .
i advise you to take it .
you didn &apos;t believe the sexual harassment allegation ?
not a chance .
why not ?
well , for starters , it came out of tanner &apos;s mouth .
and i know tim petroff , and he didn &apos;t cheat on his wife .
and you &apos;re angry at him for that ?
you &apos;re damn right i am !
there are some things you just don &apos;t do .
like lie ?
like threaten to rip a man &apos;s family apart .
what ?
i just find it interesting that you talk about family
as if it were sacred , yet you &apos;ve never married .
you &apos;ve never had a family of your own .
i don &apos;t see any macaroni paintings
or school pictures in here either .
and my personal life is not the topic here .
so why don &apos;t we get back to what is ?
if it was such a good idea to pick a fight with tanner ,
why were you so angry at him for doing exactly
what you knew he would do ?
you &apos;re the doctor . you tell me .
okay , maybe because getting angry at someone
is a way to avoid facing what &apos;s going on with yourself .
oh , good , you &apos;re back .
can &apos;t be good if you &apos;re out here .
oh , i didn &apos;t want you to get ambushed . there &apos;s a--
tim petroff of betasoft in my office .
he &apos;s been wearing out your carpet for half an hour .
tanner must have sent him a copy of the complaint .
if you mean that paper balled up in his fist , i &apos;d say he did .
thanks for the heads @-@ up , gretchen .
tim , before you say anything--
sexual harassment ? what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s only a draft . it hasn &apos;t been filed yet .
and that &apos;s supposed to make me feel better ?
it &apos;s a goddamn lie .
i have never done anything remotely resembling harassing anyone .
tim , calm down .
i &apos;m not going to calm down .
this is a complete twisting of who i am .
i want this woman destroyed .
it &apos;s not her . it &apos;s her lawyer .
i don &apos;t care who it is .
i have a wife and children , and i want this thing gone .
then you should know there &apos;s a settlement on the table .
mike ! not now .
what settlement ?
a 15 % stake in her venture .
are you out of your mind ?
you think i &apos;m gonna settle with these people based on blackmail ?
no one &apos;s settling .
yeah , you &apos;re damn right no one &apos;s settling .
now earn your money and blow this woman out of the water .
you heard him .
figure out a way to put the screws to her once and for all .
harvey .
and i don &apos;t want to hear any shit about my state of mind .
i &apos;m not gonna say anything about that ,
but what i will say is that if tanner &apos;s willing to make her do this ,
what &apos;s to say he &apos;s not willing to make her
do something worse ?
what do you want to do , mike ? you want to back down ?
no , i want to get tanner fired .
it &apos;s not legal for us to talk to her .
there &apos;s no law against me running into her by accident .
rachel , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
don &apos;t you mean , &quot; hey , rachel , how did your test go ? &quot;
i don &apos;t care how your test went .
i just need you to get me everything you can
on john dellmore .
louis , we &apos;ve already been over this .
his lawyer &apos;s his wife . you &apos;re never gonna sign him .
well , that &apos;s just it . i don &apos;t need to sign him .
i only need to pretend to sign him .
okay . that &apos;s a bad idea .
no , it &apos;s not .
if jack thinks i signed dellmore ,
and i tell him i &apos;ll give him a piece ,
he &apos;ll know it &apos;s worth a fortune to him
and he &apos;ll overturn the vote .
and what are you gonna do when he finds out
the whole thing was a lie ?
he won &apos;t . i &apos;ll make up some sob story
about how dellmore made up with his wife
and we &apos;ll live to fight another day .
he &apos;s never gonna believe that .
rachel , katrina would have been
on board with this from day one .
okay , louis , i &apos;m sorry .
i am not trying to rain on your parade ,
but when jack finds out , he &apos;s going to hate you forever .
well , i made a promise to harvey .
and if it &apos;s a choice between jack hating me
and breaking that promise ,
i &apos;m picking harvey every single time .
what exactly do you need ?
i need a way to dazzle the shit out of john dellmore .
thank you .
i don &apos;t understand . my bill &apos;s been paid ?
yes , sir , it has .
by who ?
uh , by me .
and who exactly are you ?
i &apos;m louis litt .
and not only did i pay for your check ,
i also brought you another one .
you &apos;re donating $ 50,000 to my charity .
yes .
why would you want to--
because it may not look like it , but i was homeless .
i spent two years on the streets ,
and had it not been for your family &apos;s organization ,
i would not be the man i am today .
is there anything i can do to thank you ?
just keep doing what you &apos;re doing .
you , sir , are a true american hero .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , good , you &apos;re here .
what the hell was that ?
that was john dellmore .
yeah , i know who it is .
why was he giving you a hug ?
because i just convinced him to let us handle his merger .
does that have something to do with why we &apos;re here ?
it &apos;s got everything to do with why we &apos;re here ,
because i knew that you would never believe
that i could close dellmore .
you &apos;re right .
if i hadn &apos;t seen it myself , i never would have believed it .
and why is that ? because i &apos;m a grinder ?
here &apos;s the thing , jack .
when you took on harvey ,
you pitted the grinders against the rainmakers ,
and that was a good move ,
but you want to move to the next level ?
we need to be both grinders and rainmakers .
do you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that we need to revisit
the compensation agreement .
no way . why would i do that ?
because when we get this business ,
it will be worth a fortune to us .
&quot; us &quot; ?
yes , us , jack .
if you are with me on this ,
i will give you 50 cents to every dollar that i make .
yeah . let &apos;s get this done .
careful , it &apos;s really hot .
a woman once sued mcdonald &apos;s for getting burned .
although i guess you could just say you got burned
and sue them anyway .
who are you ?
doesn &apos;t matter who i am . it matters who i work for .
tim petroff .
you can &apos;t talk to me .
i &apos;m just fixing my coffee .
you want to walk away , walk away , but before you do ,
i &apos;m gonna say to nobody in particular
that you should fire your lawyer .
i &apos;m not firing anybody .
well , then you should also know that
falsely accusing someone
of sexual harassment is a criminal offense ,
and no matter what travis tanner has told you
to convince you that you &apos;ll get away with it , you won &apos;t .
there &apos;s nothing in that complaint
that isn &apos;t factually correct .
you are twisting those facts and you could ruin a man &apos;s life ,
and you know it .
oh , and how is that different from what he &apos;s doing to me ?
it &apos;s completely different .
is it ?
i worked for that man 60 hours a week for 10 years ,
and now that i want to start my own company ,
he not only wants to crush me ,
but he told people i stole the idea .
if that &apos;s not ruining a person &apos;s life ,
then i don &apos;t know what is .
oh , and as far as travis tanner goes ,
sexual harassment wasn &apos;t his idea .
it was mine .
and when he tried to talk me out of it ,
i told him he could either get on board
or watch me get another lawyer .
rachel zane , you glorious creature .
glorious ?
yes , glorious .
i mean , you were masterful .
the charity ,
his lone lunches at his favorite restaurant ,
having jack show up at the perfect time .
i mean , you are not only a brilliant attorney ,
you &apos;re the backbone of this entire--
louis , i &apos;m not going mudding with you .
god damn it ! what did donna tell you ?
she told me that if it went well ,
you would come in here trying to get a celebratory mud ,
and that if it didn &apos;t go well ,
you would try to get a sympathy mud .
wait a second , i could have got a sympathy mud ?
no , you couldn &apos;t .
but the good news is , you got what you wanted with jack ,
and on top of that , louis , you really made a difference
in the lives of homeless children .
which reminds me . after the vote ,
i want you to put a stop payment on that check .
okay , no--that is a despicable thing to do .
please , any charity claiming to do a good thing
is clearly a scam . i won &apos;t have it .
so you mean you &apos;re cheap ?
you know what , for someone
who won &apos;t throw me a sympathy mud ,
you &apos;re very judgmental .
louis . what can i do for you ?
you can give me your proxy .
why would i do that ?
because you asked me
to bring the compensation issue up for a vote
like a man and i did .
and is jack soloff aware of this ?
not only aware of it , he &apos;s voting for it .
and however did you get him to do that ?
let &apos;s just say that you wanted me to do this
like harvey would have and not like i would have ,
but i did the best of both .
then you have my proxy .
harvey , i talked to alyssa lang
and there &apos;s something you should know .
let me guess , she batted her eyes ,
told you a sob story ,
and now you think she &apos;s some kind of innocent .
no , i don &apos;t .
in fact , she told me that
the sexual harassment idea was hers .
and why do i need to know that ?
i think we should consider taking the deal .
well , we &apos;re not gonna do that .
why not ?
because first of all , there &apos;s now way on earth
that tim &apos;s gonna settle .
you could convince him and you know it .
and second of all , there &apos;s no way on earth
that that suit was her idea .
harvey , you weren &apos;t there , all right ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t have to be there to know
that if tanner could convince her to do that bullshit
in the first place , he could sure as hell get her
to say it was her idea .
he couldn &apos;t have known that i was gonna contact her .
he could , and he did .
and i don &apos;t want to hear another word about it .
and while you were away trying to get her to cut him loose ,
i was here trying to figure out how to do
what tim asked us to do and blow her away .
harvey , this isn &apos;t a joke .
i &apos;m not joking .
the only way to get tanner to back down
is to point a cannon in his face .
you &apos;re not pointing it in his face .
you &apos;re pointing it in hers , and once you put this in motion ,
there &apos;s no guarantee that you &apos;re gonna be able to pull it back .
she should have thought of that before
she hired travis tanner .
listen , i &apos;m gonna start by introducing the proposal ,
then you chime in .
jack , i gave you 50 % of dellmore ,
but i need to be seen as leading the charge on this .
louis , i got the partners in line
by telling them it was my proposal .
okay , so i &apos;ll introduce you with my full support
and then you can just take it from there .
okay .
oh , and by the way , when we win this thing ,
maybe you and i can go mudding together .
why don &apos;t we just focus on our meeting ?
right .
first of all , i would like to thank everyone for coming .
the issue at hand is a very important proposal
that jack and i have been working on .
i have both harvey and jessica &apos;s proxies .
and i am pleased to say this measure has their full support .
jack .
thank you , louis .
in light of the impact of recent changes in the firm
resulting from the new compensation structure ,
louis and i strongly feel that there should be
no new policy changes for the next 12 months .
what ?
and as louis just said , the name partners gave their blessing .
so why don &apos;t we make it unanimous ?
all in favor ?
motion seems to have passed .
next order of business .
what the hell did you just do ?
what the hell did i do ? i protected my own interests .
we had a deal !
we didn &apos;t have a thing .
you think i bought that john dellmore stunt at the restaurant ?
i was on to you the second you walked over to my table .
i let you give me that bullshit speech
about grinders and rainmakers just so i could do
what i just did .
okay , i get it .
you made your point , you made a name for yourself ,
but , jack , you need to undo this .
what makes you think i could have undone it
in the first place ?
they voted for that proposal
because it put more money in their pockets ,
and now it &apos;s there to stay .
by the way , if you want to go mudding with someone ,
why don &apos;t you ask harvey specter ?
because it doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure out
that he &apos;s the one that got you to carry his water
in the first place .
thanks .
i got you the special .
did you say no pickles ?
you didn &apos;t say no pickles .
i didn &apos;t say , &quot; order my lunch . &quot;
so sue me .
you send the notification over to tanner ?
two hours ago .
then it won &apos;t be long .
what ?
i didn &apos;t say anything about your state of mind after tim petroff
because i wasn &apos;t worried about it then ,
but i am now .
mike--
what if it doesn &apos;t work ?
it &apos;ll work .
and what if it doesn &apos;t ?
then it &apos;s on tanner .
no , it &apos;s on you , because i &apos;m telling you right now ,
tanner is not driving this thing .
well , speak of the devil .
you son of a bitch .
you filed criminal charges against my client ?
you &apos;re damn right we did .
she forged a fake driver &apos;s license
and attached it to her w2 .
that &apos;s ten years of tax fraud .
oh , you piece of shit .
this is crossing the line even for you .
for me ?
ever since the day i met you , all you &apos;ve done is cross lines ,
and it started with you ripping off cancer victims ,
not to mention every other thing you &apos;ve ever done .
hey , i told you i am not that guy anymore .
yeah , right before you tried to ruin my client &apos;s life
with some bullshit sexual harassment charge .
right after he padlocked my client &apos;s livelihood .
yeah , you &apos;re damn right he did !
harvey--
because if you &apos;re on a case against me ,
it &apos;s just a matter of time
until you eviscerate someone i care about .
eviscerate ?
if i was gonna eviscerate someone you cared about ,
all i &apos;d have to do is point out
how donna &apos;s no longer working for you .
hey , get out of here , tanner .
she &apos;s working for louis litt .
what did you just say to me ?
you heard me .
and then i &apos;d go up to her and say , &quot; what happened , red ?
&quot; did harvey get tired of banging you ?
&quot; or was he such a lousy lay that you left him
&quot; for the guy down the road just like harvey &apos;s mom
&quot; did to dear , old dad ? &quot;
harvey ! harvey ! stop !
tanner , get out of here now !
go !
you &apos;re absolutely convinced
tanner couldn &apos;t be telling the truth ?
what does it matter ?
well , you could be ruining this woman &apos;s life .
that &apos;s not my problem .
so you don &apos;t believe in second chances ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
no , you just said
a man you didn &apos;t trust swore he changed .
and instead of giving him a chance to prove that ,
you launched an all @-@ out war .
were you listening to my goddamn story ?
did you hear what he said ?
that is not a man that &apos;s changed .
no , i &apos;m talking about what you did .
you launched an all @-@ out war .
i did that for my client .
and for your information ,
i &apos;ve given plenty of people second chances .
like who ?
louis , for one .
mike .
donna , scottie ,
my brother , my ...
your what ?
i thought we were talking about the case .
we started by talking about your dream .
yeah , the one i had because of my case .
mm @-@ hmm . and you said the woman in that dream
wasn &apos;t donna .
but it doesn &apos;t add up , because the man was tanner
and you just told me what he said about her the same day
that you had that dream .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t care if it doesn &apos;t add up
because i &apos;m telling the truth .
and yet you have tells all over you that say otherwise .
then you don &apos;t know what a tell is ,
because i don &apos;t have any .
all right .
we &apos;ll see who knows what a tell is .
you want to play poker with me ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
i &apos;m gonna play poker with you .
and when i win , and you &apos;re out of money ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me the truth .
and what do i get when you &apos;re out of money ?
it doesn &apos;t matter &apos; cause it &apos;s never gonna happen .
i need to talk to you about something .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just got a call from travis tanner .
he wants me to meet him in half an hour .
well , you have to tell harvey .
i left him two messages .
he hasn &apos;t gotten back to me , but even if he does ,
he &apos;s gonna tell me not to go .
well , then don &apos;t go .
you can &apos;t go behind harvey &apos;s back .
that &apos;s the thing .
what if going to see tanner is more like having harvey &apos;s back ?
what are you talking about ?
the client on the other side of our case
made a fake id ten years ago
and now harvey &apos;s ready to send her to prison for it ,
and he &apos;s only doing it because of tanner .
okay , but it &apos;s still harvey &apos;s call .
and if he makes that call in his current state of mind ,
he might regret it for the rest of his life .
what do you mean , his current state of mind ?
a couple of weeks ago , i walked into harvey &apos;s office
and he was having a panic attack .
oh , my god .
and on top of that , yesterday ,
the two of them got into a yelling match
that ended with harvey punching tanner .
okay , look .
do whatever you have to do .
have harvey &apos;s back .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
bullshit , you don &apos;t know .
jessica , i swear i haven &apos;t seen him since last night .
then i need to know , did he lie to me ?
donna ... i &apos;ve always trusted you .
now i need you to trust me .
did he do some underhanded shit to fool jack
and it backfired ?
yes .
that &apos;s exactly what he did .
then find him .
and tell him to come see me .
what can i say ? kings full of 6s .
all right , harvey , you won .
what do you want ?
can &apos;t i take a minute to enjoy my win ?
you can .
but once our time &apos;s up , i &apos;m done granting wishes .
well , in that case , i want you to tell me
the worst mistake you ever made as a therapist .
that wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
no , no , no , no .
you didn &apos;t make a deal with me because you were so sure
you were gonna beat me .
well , you didn &apos;t , and it &apos;s time to pay the piper .
well , i &apos;m not going to do it .
look who &apos;s deflecting now .
look , i get it , okay ?
you &apos;re here because your fears are affecting your work ,
and now you &apos;re trying to find a time where i failed at my job
so that you can lash out at me .
and i &apos;m not gonna let you do it .
no , i just want you to know
what it feels like to be me in here with you ,
and if you &apos;re not willing to do that ,
then what the hell good are you ?
i killed someone .
what ?
i do a lot of work as an expert witness
in corporate competency situations .
you mean substance abuse ?
yes .
and usually it &apos;s high @-@ powered people
looking to keep their jobs .
but this time it was different .
a client needed someone to get his son out of rehab
so that he could attend his mother &apos;s funeral .
i knew it was a mistake to even get involved
because he wanted it so badly , but he was a long @-@ time client
and i cared about him , so i did it .
i evaluated his son .
and i knew--i knew deep down inside he wasn &apos;t ready ,
but i gave the go @-@ ahead anyway ,
and the night of the funeral ,
he overdosed and died .
i &apos;m so sorry .
well , i don &apos;t want you to be sorry .
i want you to sit your ass down and tell me the truth
about the dream .
i told you before . i &apos;m telling you the truth .
i don &apos;t know who this woman was .
you know what , i just opened myself up to you
to show you that i know what it &apos;s like to be you ,
but i don &apos;t .
because i know that the only way to come to terms
with what &apos;s inside is to let it out .
and until you figure that out ,
you might as well get the hell out
because you &apos;re wasting both our time .
i remember when you used to ride a bike .
i remember when you used to be a scumbag
but you didn &apos;t pretend you weren &apos;t .
why am i here , tanner ?
i want you to reconsider our settlement offer .
and what makes you think
we &apos;re going to accept the same deal
that you brought us before ?
because i &apos;ve sat across from you ,
and i know that you care about more than just the fight .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but that fight &apos;s gonna end
with alyssa lang going to prison .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t have to .
and the only reason it &apos;s gonna end that way
is because that deal is coming from me .
how the hell am i supposed to believe a word you say ?
what do you want me to say , huh ?
that i got tired of playing the goon ?
because i did .
yeah , i woke up one morning and i said ,
&quot; enough is enough . &quot;
and i haven &apos;t taken one case that i don &apos;t believe in
or done anything that i couldn &apos;t stomach since .
look , mike .
i don &apos;t have a leg to stand on .
i don &apos;t have another move , but you can convince harvey
to convince petroff not to destroy this girl &apos;s life .
you just need to decide if you &apos;re willing to do that , man .
travis , you keep saying that harvey won &apos;t take the deal
because your name &apos;s on it .
but if you really are a changed man ,
maybe it &apos;s time you prove it .
oh . hey , you &apos;re not toner .
donna , please , leave me alone .
louis , you can &apos;t hide in here forever .
i have to because i made a promise to harvey ,
and not only did i drop the ball , i shit the bed .
and on top of that , i lied to jessica telling her
that i wouldn &apos;t be doing any more underhanded shit with jack .
well , she knows what you did .
and it &apos;s time to face the music .
oh , did you not just hear me ?
i defied a direct order .
i admit that , i might as well tell her
that i put harvey &apos;s salary in the copy machine
in the first place .
you know what , maybe you should .
that &apos;s really hilarious . what , are you crazy ?
no , louis , i &apos;m not .
you keep making bad decision after bad decision .
and this is a chance to wipe them all clean .
it &apos;s not gonna wipe anything clean .
all it &apos;s gonna do is get me fired .
yeah , maybe it will .
the one thing i do know is you &apos;ve lost jessica &apos;s trust .
this at least gives you a chance to get it back .
it &apos;s a hell of a lot better than cowering in here .
what is it , louis ?
i &apos;m here to tell you the truth .
that you lied when you said you weren &apos;t going
to do anything underhanded with jack ?
that i was the one that left harvey &apos;s salary
in the copy machine ... on purpose .
why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
because i haven &apos;t decided what i &apos;m going to do .
but what you &apos;re going to do ...
is get jack goddamn soloff up here .
you wanted to see me ?
yes , i did .
louis has brought something to my attention .
and what is that ?
well , according to subsection c35 of the bylaws ,
we broke protocol when we changed
the compensation formula .
bullshit . there is no subsection c35 .
you &apos;re wrong .
here , take a look .
i don &apos;t need to look .
and if you &apos;re asking me to sell this to the partners ,
you &apos;re shit out of luck .
no , you &apos;re shit out of luck .
because louis didn &apos;t just come to me with the bylaws .
he admitted that it was you
who deliberately put harvey &apos;s salary out there
for all the world to see .
isn &apos;t that right , louis ?
i ... am sorry , jack .
i had to come clean .
it was the right thing to do .
you lying piece of shit .
watch it , jack .
you &apos;re talking to a name partner .
and you &apos;re saying that he &apos;s lying ,
but as head of the compensation committee ,
you had access to harvey &apos;s salary .
i didn &apos;t leave that document out and i can prove it .
how is that ?
i know for a fact that--
oh , let me help you out .
the reason you stopped yourself
is that you were going to say louis left it out .
but if you knew that , and still didn &apos;t come forward ,
then i can fire your ass for that , too .
but you &apos;re not going to do that
because you &apos;d also have to fire him .
and you can &apos;t afford another shake @-@ up .
you &apos;re right . i can &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t care , because i &apos;d rather fire you both
than to let you push me around .
so it &apos;s up to you , jack .
stand by provision c35 ...
or pack up your shit .
forgive me , jessica , you &apos;re right .
next time i &apos;ll read the bylaws more carefully .
you knew this whole thing would play out this way
the second it started , right ?
i had a pretty good idea .
jessica ...
when am i gonna learn not to defy you ?
you &apos;re never going to learn .
but as long as i know that , we &apos;ll be okay .
i--
feel like going mudding tonight ?
no .
i figured .
you better be here to tell me tanner &apos;s walking away .
i &apos;m here to tell you that i met with him today .
you went to see him without telling me ?
i left you two messages .
so the hell what ?
you don &apos;t cut me out of a meeting on my case .
your case ?
well , tanner &apos;s made a settlement offer on your case ,
and i think that we should take it .
are you kidding ? we have a boot to his throat .
we don &apos;t have to settle .
all we have to do is decide how hard to press .
you &apos;re not pressing on his throat ,
you &apos;re pressing on alyssa lang &apos;s .
so all he has to do is claim that he &apos;s a changed man
and you take his side over mine ?
i &apos;m not on his side .
our client stands to make a fortune from this deal
without lifting a finger .
i don &apos;t give a shit .
you saw what he did , and you heard what he said .
and you said when we started this ,
it would be just like old times , but right now ,
you &apos;re acting like the bad guy , not him .
that piece of shit hasn &apos;t changed
and i &apos;m not settling with him .
and i &apos;m not asking you to .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s the original offer .
only now the attorney of record is katrina bennet .
i had tanner remove himself from the case ,
so now you &apos;re not settling with him .
you &apos;re just doing what &apos;s best for everyone .
take the deal .
you sure you don &apos;t want to read it first ?
i don &apos;t have to .
唐娜
rachel , i cannot talk right now .
i &apos;m going mudding with donna .
no , louis , you &apos;re going mudding with both of us .
louis ?
i have to say ,
i &apos;m surprised you called for another appointment .
what can i say ?
you telling me that story got to me .
so you &apos;re ready to tell the truth ?
i am .
the woman in my dream was donna .
well , i &apos;m glad you came back to talk about it .
and since you &apos;ve opened up to me ,
i &apos;m going to open up to you .
i believe you &apos;re telling the truth .
that &apos;s opening up ?
no , this is .
i believe you &apos;re telling the truth ,
but i don &apos;t think the woman
in your dream was actually donna .
i think it was your mother .
i don &apos;t believe it .
i tell you the thing that &apos;s been eating at me for days ,
and you &apos;re calling me a liar ?
no , i &apos;m not calling you a liar .
your dream was a representation of unresolved issues .
the only unresolved issue is i opened up
and you &apos;re turning on me .
harvey , bringing up your mother isn &apos;t turning on you .
you have no idea what bringing up my mother is to me !
no , i don &apos;t . that &apos;s the whole point of what we &apos;re doing here .
it doesn &apos;t matter what we &apos;re doing here &apos; cause we &apos;re done .
harvey , harvey , look .
i don &apos;t care how much money you make
or how many women you sleep with .
you have issues in your life that will keep you
from having real relationships .
and you can tell yourself all you want
that it has nothing to do with your mother ,
but it &apos;s a lie and you know it .
well , like i said , we &apos;re done .
