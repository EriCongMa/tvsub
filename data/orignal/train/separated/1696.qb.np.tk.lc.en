my new book &lt; i &gt; the hidden reality &lt; / i &gt; takes on a grand question :
is our universe the only universe ?
you see , there &apos;s a growing belief among scientists like me
that ours may only be one among many universes
populating a gigantic cosmos .
in &lt; i &gt; the hidden reality &lt; / i &gt; , i explore this possibility
without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics
on the part of the reader .
hysterical .
i &apos;m glad you talked me into this .
we work so hard , sometimes , it &apos;s nice to goof off
and do something silly .
agreed .
wait till you hear how he dumbs down werner heisenberg for the crowd .
you may actually believe you &apos;re in a comedy club .
you can think about heisenberg &apos;s &quot; uncertainty principle &quot;
much like the special order menu
that you find in certain chinese restaurants , where you have
dishes in column a and other dishes in column b ,
and if you order the first dish in column a ,
you can &apos;t order the corresponding dish in column b.
that &apos;s sort of like the &quot; uncertainly principle . &quot;
ba @-@ dum @-@ bump .
say , i heard an interesting tidbit
about howard and bernadette .
really , amy ? gossip ?
i &apos;m disappointed in you .
no , now .
evolutionary biologist robin dunbar has identified gossip
as an aid to social bonding in large groups .
forgive my language , but &quot; poppycock . &quot;
what if he &apos;s right ?
and by not participating in gossip ,
society breaks down into
small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders
fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish .
fine .
in the parlance of the urban music scene ,
&quot; what &apos;s the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 &quot; ?
bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard .
i believe our nation &apos;s tuna cans are safe .
excuse me . dr. greene , question ?
yes ?
you &apos;ve dedicated your life &apos;s work
to educating the general populace
about complex scientific ideas .
yes , in part .
have you ever considered
trying to do something useful ?
perhaps , reading to the elderly ?
excuse me ?
yeah , but not your books ; something they might enjoy .
i kid , of course . big fan .
nice shot .
thank you .
my father taught me archery as a child .
it &apos;s odd how the activity
brings back the smell of kmart bourbon .
perfect .
i know .
what an elf i would have made .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
shooting at a target ?
with what ?
an arrow .
really ?
i didn &apos;t see you draw one from your quiver .
i &apos;m not going to do that , sheldon .
leonard , the people at nintendo can only go so far
in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience .
we have to do our part , too .
that was uncalled for , but ...
i &apos;ll play along . ow .
i had an unusual experience with amy last night .
really ? how could you tell ?
she was attempting to engage me in gossip .
mm . you don &apos;t say .
yes .
i think prolonged exposure to penny
has turned her into a bit of a gabby gertie .
so , what &apos;s the gossip ?
oh , please , i was just pointing it out .
i have no desire to engage in the activity .
fine , don &apos;t tell me .
all right , get this .
bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard .
that &apos;s too bad . i wonder what happened .
mm , it &apos;s hard to say . i can only speculate
based on the data i collected
watching my parents &apos; marriage implode .
in that case , the woman dives into religion ,
while the man dives into a bottle @-@ blonde bartender
who tries to buy my love with action figures .
oop ! out of arrows .
boy , you sure get your money &apos;s worth out of these games .
priya , can i come in ?
sure .
oh , god .
what ?
it &apos;s okay .
you didn &apos;t know . i &apos;ll take care of it .
what @-@ what did i do ?
sheldon doesn &apos;t allow flossing
that close to the mirror .
you &apos;re kidding .
it &apos;s a splatter thing .
there &apos;s a little piece of tape on the floor
you &apos;re supposed to stand behind .
that &apos;s madness .
i know .
just do it . there &apos;s a big inspection coming up ,
and i don &apos;t want to lose my tv privileges .
you really need to let me take a look
at that roommate agreement , one of these days .
mm , i don &apos;t know .
i get a lawyer , he gets a lawyer ...
it &apos;s just easier to stand behind the tape .
oh , by the way , a fellow at work said
i could use his dodger tickets this weekend .
does that sound like fun ?
yeah !
dodgers are baseball , right ?
you &apos;ll need to explain the game to me .
mm , it &apos;s complicated .
but as i remember it , the essentials are
&quot; get chosen last , get hit by the ball , cry , go home &quot; .
well , regardless , i &apos;ve got four tickets .
and i was thinking we can bring bernadette and howard .
she &apos;s really interesting ,
and i bet i can get used to him .
well , it might not be a great idea
to invite those two .
why not ?
don &apos;t tell anybody i told you ,
but i heard she might be breaking up with him .
oh ... too bad ...
although i do know one person for whom that &apos;s good news .
really ? who ?
my brother .
he &apos;s got a big crush on bernadette .
what ?
you &apos;re kidding .
no . i found poems he wrote about her .
very disturbing .
&quot; oh , bernadette , please play my clarinet &quot; .
wow , that &apos;s hard to believe .
yes .
and for years , everyone in my family
was convinced that &lt; i &gt; he &lt; / i &gt; was the clarinet enthusiast .
what &apos;s that piece of tape ?
oh , that one doesn &apos;t apply to you . you sit .
how &apos;s it going ?
not too bad . did you hear about howard and bernadette ?
&apos;course i heard about it . how did you hear about it ?
i heard about it from sheldon .
he got it from amy .
oh , damn it .
i told amy that in the strictest confidence .
boy , some people are such blabbermouths .
well , whatever .
i &apos;m sure bernadette can do better .
do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist
with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than
a hundred @-@ pound jewish guy who lives with his mom ?
you are kidding . raj likes bernadette ?
i didn &apos;t say raj . who said &lt; i &gt; raj ? &lt; / i &gt;
okay , give .
how do you know ? did he tell you ?
no .
well , then who ?
i can &apos;t say ...
priya told you . what a little gossip .
you know , not an attractive quality in a woman , leonard .
not judging , just my opinion .
well , the point is , if this got out ,
it would destroy howard and raj &apos;s friendship .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
unlike amy and priya , i know how to keep a secret .
you &apos;re the one who told amy in the first place .
in confidence .
hello , mummy . hello , daddy . how are you ?
we &apos;re very rich in a very poor country .
so , all in all , can &apos;t complain .
so , priya ,
how are enjoying staying with your brother ?
it &apos;s fine . but if i &apos;m going to stay
in los angeles much longer ,
i think i should get my own place .
why ?
is rajesh not making you feel comfortable ?
rajesh , why aren &apos;t you making your sister comfortable ?
i am making her comfortable .
besides , she &apos;s not sleeping here
half the time anyw ...
what ?
where are you sleeping , priya ?
it &apos;s a figure of speech , daddy .
it means i @-@ i work late .
please tell me you &apos;re not dating an american .
i knew this would happen .
rajesh , are you letting your sister
date that little howard boy ?
now , hold on . if she is dating an american ,
that &apos;s not a bad way to go .
he &apos;s jewish .
those chaps are very successful ,
and they don &apos;t drink a lot .
it @-@ it doesn &apos;t matter . howard has a girlfriend .
for now .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;ll tell you later .
is something going on with him and bernadette ?
who &apos;s bernadette ?
doesn &apos;t sound jewish .
you can &apos;t tell by that .
winona ryder is jewish .
okay , we &apos;re getting off the subject .
rajesh , i want you to try harder
to make your sister feel welcome .
thank you , daddy .
don &apos;t worry . everything i have , i share with her .
including my friend leon ...
good night , mummy . good night , daddy .
oh , my god , i think you broke my toe !
you should have kept your mouth shut .
fair enough .
now , what &apos;s up with clarinet ... ? bernadette !
i &apos;ve been thinking about dr. greene &apos;s efforts
to make science palatable for the masses .
oh , yeah ? what about it ?
that &apos;s all . i &apos;ve just been thinking about it .
now , i &apos;m thinking about fractal equations .
now i &apos;m thinking about
the origin of the phrase &quot; train of thought . &quot;
now i &apos;m thinking about trains .
are you listening to this guy ?
hmm ? oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i was somewhere else .
lucky bastard .
now i &apos;m thinking about jell @-@ o.
so what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s a bernadette thing .
oh , no . i hope everything &apos;s okay .
whatever it is , we &apos;re here for you .
you can tell us anything .
yeah . good or devastating .
i &apos;m gonna ask her to marry me .
marry you ?
what ?
i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question .
oh , i &apos;d wait .
no rush , no rush .
oh , great . it &apos;s my cousin david about the ring .
hey , david , what &apos;d you find ?
sure , a half a caret &apos;s fine .
her freakishly small hands make anything look big .
it &apos;s one of the reasons i love her .
man , he &apos;s going to be blindsided .
i know . it &apos;ll be awful .
why are you smiling ?
yeah , raj , why ?
uh , a smile means something different in my country .
you know , tears of joy , smile of sadness .
india &apos;s a goofy place .
oh , i &apos;m back to trains .
did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction ?
no .
fascinating work .
i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes .
have you learned anything ?
yes . he looks much cooler than the non @-@ smoking monkeys .
although it &apos;s not much of a contest .
the other monkeys just sit around and masturbate .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to stop listening to you and start talking .
by all means .
howard has announced his intention
to propose marriage to bernadette .
i don &apos;t understand .
the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup .
i know .
the group consensus is that his proposal
will be met with an humiliating , soul @-@ crushing rejection .
everyone was set a @-@ twitter .
although oddly , no one tweeted .
it &apos;s not surprising that the story
has captured the attention of our little circle of friends .
are you familiar with meme theory ?
i &apos;m familiar with everything , but go on .
meme theory suggests that
items of gossip are like living things
that seek to reproduce using humans as their host .
i &apos;m no stranger to memetic epidemiology .
at johnson elementary school ,
the phrase &quot; shelly cooper &apos;s a smelly pooper &quot; spread like wildfire .
i should think so .
that &apos;s gold .
your meme hypothesis does intrigue me .
how might we examine this more closely ?
do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation ?
it &apos;s one of the few forms of interaction with people
that i don &apos;t find repellent .
we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip .
and a second non @-@ tantalizing piece to use as a control .
then we &apos;ll track its progress through our social group
and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms
of memetic theory , algebraic gossip and epidemiology .
look at you , getting me to engage in the social sciences .
you &apos;re a vixen , amy farrah fowler .
oh , hey , amy . what &apos;s up ?
sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse .
in other news , i &apos;m thinking of starting an herb garden .
mum &apos;s the word . gotta go .
oh , hey , raj , what are you doing here ?
i just felt like drinking alone ,
because i &apos;m deep and dark .
so , uh , howard &apos;s not here ?
no . it &apos;s just one of those times when it &apos;s just you and me .
like when the three of us went to the movies ,
and you and i waited outside the bathroom
while howard threw up red vines and cherry coke .
do you remember that ?
yeah .
me , too .
good times .
16 wants to order appetizers .
oh , thanks .
this was nice .
what the hell are you doing ?
howard is your best friend , and that is his girlfriend .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
i was when i came in ,
but it &apos;s amazing what liquor does to guilt .
besides what you might not know
is bernadette is planning on breaking up with howard .
well , i know that . how do you know that ?
my sister told me .
oh , that gossipy bitch .
no offense .
none taken .
you should hear how she talks about you .
okay , listen ,
just because howard and bernadette are having problems ,
does not mean you should be here sniffing around .
what can i do ? i can &apos;t stop thinking about her .
all right , try thinking about this--
sheldon and amy had sex .
shut your ass !
yeah , it &apos;s true . amy told me .
how did that even happen ?
did they know that &apos;s what they were doing
when they were doing it ?
i @-@ i guess they just figurd it out at some point .
i can &apos;t believe old smelly pooper finally got laid .
hope you &apos;re hungry .
interesting .
a friendly sentiment in this country ,
cruel taunt in the sudan .
it &apos;s a lesson in context .
will amy be joining us for dinner ?
yes , i believe so .
good , good .
everything ... okay between you two ?
yes .
why do you ask ?
no reason .
i was just talking to raj ,
and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days .
did he mean as if she &apos;d been out in the sun ,
tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock ?
no .
that &apos;s not what he meant .
well , we may never know .
as my mother would say ,
the asians are an inscrutable folk .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have work to do .
yeah , you do .
you dog , you .
did you get that ?
every word .
our false gossip meme
appears to have reached node lambda .
this is moving faster than we thought .
agreed .
it appears the rate of gossip transmission
is proportional to the number of nodes squared .
i must say , amy ,
pretending to have intercourse with you
is giving me a great deal of satisfaction .
slow down , sheldon . i &apos;m not quite there yet .
pass the soy sauce .
sure
bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you .
the meme has reached full penetration .
pun intended ?
no . happy accident .
this is remarkable .
took less than 24 hours .
i should let you know
that she asked for details about our dalliance .
interesting .
so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus
to a &quot; blow by blow , &quot; as it were .
pun intended ?
i &apos;m sorry . what pun ?
not important .
i described your lovemaking as &quot; aloof , but effective . &quot;
i wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
that &apos;s going to make me a chick magnet ,
and i &apos;m so busy as it is .
hey , everybody ,
i got something i want to ask bernadette ,
and i can &apos;t think of a better time
than when i &apos;m with all my friends .
oh , hold on , howard .
there &apos;s lots of better times .
leonard , please . the man is talking .
let him get it out , and let the chips fall where they may .
thank you .
bernadette maryann rostenkowski ...
oh , god . what &apos;s happening ?
i know things haven &apos;t been perfect with us ,
and we &apos;ve had our problems ,
but i just have to tell you , from the moment i ...
howard , let me just stop you right here .
this is it .
yes .
yes , what ?
yes , i will marry you .
you will ?
you will ?
i will .
i will !
oh , i love you so much .
oh , i love you , too .
congratulations !
oh , it &apos;s so exciting .
i wonder what changed her mind .
perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess
renewed her faith in love .
as good an explanation as any .
that &apos;s great ...
oh , hey , amy .
bernadette just texted me .
howard proposed ?
yes , not important . just stopped by
to let you know i &apos;m getting orthotics .
also , i &apos;m carrying sheldon &apos;s baby .
mum &apos;s the word .
you &apos;re pregnant ? !
wow . is there anything on there about orthotics ?
