that staycation beard &apos;s really taking shape , dad .
it &apos;s starting to trap food .
yep .
it &apos;s gone from itchin &apos; to bitchin &apos; .
and you &apos;re still rocking the sweats .
every day this week .
same underwear ?
what underwear ?
hold that thought .
do i have to ?
mayor &apos;s office . city of phila @-@ dunphy @-@ a .
i &apos;m sorry . i just got done .
my computer crashed ,
and we got four pallets of hinges from taiwan
with faulty riveting .
at least your story &apos;s riveting .
it &apos;s clever . i &apos;ll tell you later .
hey , why is the minivan in the driveway ?
you parked me in this morning .
i was running late for a meeting ,
so i just took haley &apos;s corolla .
fun .
it would be if it didn &apos;t smell like
the inside of bob marley &apos;s laundry hamper .
anyway , i &apos;ve got a bunch more calls to make .
i &apos;m not gonna have time to cook tonight .
we could go out .
there &apos;s that new restaurant -- sliders .
the gimmick is they built it on a slant ,
and the waiters all wear socks .
that doesn &apos;t sound good at all .
can you just order something ?
yeah , you got it .
great .
what are you doing ?
run away , little dog .
fine . go around you .
you &apos;re not gonna move .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not stopping for you .
i &apos;m stopping for you .
damn .
move it !
seriously ?
don &apos;t forget you have to watch joe while we have company .
again ?
yes , again .
what is the problem ?
he always wants to watch his show
&quot; mystery kidz , &quot; with a &quot; z. &quot;
it &apos;s insufferable .
now you know what i felt
when i had to watch your favorite show .
&quot; masterpiece theater &quot; ?
it was hosted by a creepy puppet .
that was alan cumming .
ay , jay , you have to add two more chairs .
for who ?
it &apos;s us , the mcclouds , and the sharps .
i also invited my friend dana and her husband , reece .
reece ? who &apos;s reece ?
i just told you . dana &apos;s husband .
i met her at the pta lunch ,
and she &apos;s the only woman in the anti @-@ bullying campaign
that i don &apos;t want to punch in the face .
why would i want these people in my house
messing up my poker game ?
maybe you &apos;ll meet new friends .
we &apos;ve been over this before . i don &apos;t want any new friends .
i have the exact @-@ right number of friends .
jay , your friends have been around
since before the movies could talk .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the worst idea
to start getting some backups .
hey , daddy , what &apos;s a lowest common denominator ?
reality tv .
that &apos;s hilarious ,
but i &apos;ve got a quiz tomorrow .
what is that noise ?
let me remind you that it &apos;s been weeks
since we &apos;ve had a tenant up there .
so you rented it to a rock band ?
a christian rock band .
oh , good . okay , so they &apos;re noisy and judge @-@ y .
shame on you and your narrow , big @-@ city attitude .
i &apos;ve known many accepting people of faith .
and i &apos;ve been chased into a lake .
so i guess we &apos;re both entitled to our opinion .
no !
absolutely not .
come in .
this is mitchell , and the music sounds great .
just wondering if you could turn it down a @-@ a skosh .
yeah , of course . we &apos;re sorry .
just giving the guy upstairs a taste of our new song .
he means god .
really ? there &apos;s no third floor i don &apos;t know about ?
we love the place , by the way .
it &apos;s just scrumptious .
good ! good !
so , you guys are a christian rock band ?
water to wine . yeah , that &apos;s us .
well , i hope you &apos;re not expecting
to bring all your groupies back here .
don &apos;t worry .
the soldiers of the lamb church
forbids premarital relations .
of course . but i can think of a few ladies
i wouldn &apos;t mind multiplying with
after our elders give us their blessings .
i heard that .
we love girls !
as long as you guys are here , i need an outsider &apos;s opinion .
i &apos;m working on a song ,
but these guys think it &apos;s too soft .
do you mind ?
lay it on us , bro .
* hiding for so long *
* the real me , i don &apos;t belong *
* i &apos;m not myself , i never was *
* i cry at night and all because *
* i &apos;m trapped on a secret path *
* i need a holy bath *
* to wash away the sins i hide *
* to douse the fire i feel inside *
aw , dang it , dex , you &apos;re bumming me out !
calm down , coop .
just &apos; cause we &apos;re in the city
doesn &apos;t mean we got to talk like it .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you know what , dex , i like that song .
yeah . what &apos;s the title ?
i call it &quot; a cry for help . &quot;
did you hear that ?
yeah , i &apos;m standing right here .
you &apos;re back again ?
missed you , too .
sanjay &apos;s home this weekend .
it &apos;s kind of a big day for us -- our first anniversary .
look what i got him .
it &apos;s a hadrosaur metacarpal
for his dinosaur bone collection .
too much ?
well , what &apos;s the equivalent gift if you guys were normal ?
like , a starbucks card or a rolex ?
kind of like a really nice microscope .
you &apos;re not helping .
i thought the gift for a first nerd anniversary was inhaler .
where &apos;s your dad ?
upstairs . why ?
you got us a dog ? !
no , no ! it &apos;s a stray ,
and we are not keeping him .
be quiet .
your dad cannot know he &apos;s here .
if he sees him , he &apos;ll get all attached ,
and there &apos;s no getting rid of it .
oh , it &apos;ll be like luke all over again .
at least they were married when they had me .
you ruined mom &apos;s life .
stop . i am now very happy i have all of you .
but i just can &apos;t take care of another living creature .
then why &apos;d you bring it home ?
i couldn &apos;t leave it in the street .
claire , is that you ?
take care of it .
i &apos;m not gonna kill a dog .
hide it in your room .
is that what i think it is ?
uh , no .
yeah , pizza &apos;s here .
how you doing ?
what was that ?
i &apos;m the pizza monster !
it &apos;s this new character i &apos;m doing .
i love it . i really love it .
i didn &apos;t really love it .
it felt a little close to my chicken pot pirate .
it &apos;s a mystery .
who &apos;s that ?
noni . she can be invisible .
who &apos;s that ?
gogo .
he can jump off of buildings .
this is the most unrealistic show i &apos;ve ever seen .
who &apos;s that ?
yes , great . i will open the gate .
reece . probably can &apos;t even work a gate .
maybe you &apos;ll like him .
he &apos;s the kings &apos; dentist .
well , hoity @-@ toity . i &apos;m the emperor &apos;s closet maker .
the l.a. kings hockey team .
kings &apos; dentist . why does he say it like that ?
what , is he trying to be all fancy ?
he didn &apos;t say anything . i said it .
hello .
hi .
dana , reece , this is my husband , jay .
hi , reece . how are you ?
hey , jay .
dana , come with me to the kitchen
while the boys get to know each other .
all right .
did you hear they &apos;re thinking
of eliminating cursive at the school ?
all of it , or just the &quot; f &quot; word ?
i brought you some scotch .
that &apos;s quite a bottle . thank you .
gloria tells me you &apos;re the kings &apos; dentist .
well , when you say it like that , it sounds so hoity @-@ toity .
why don &apos;t we crack that open ?
and do you have any cohiba robustos ?
oh , i wish , but , you know , they &apos;re impossible to find .
well , look at that .
i just found two .
okay , the guy wasn &apos;t all bad ,
but i couldn &apos;t let gloria know
or it would open the door for a whole bunch of new things
i don &apos;t want to do --
trendy restaurants ,
movies about how women feel about crap .
and who needs it ?
as if this week wasn &apos;t bad enough ,
now my hardware supplier in brussels is flip @-@ flopping .
sounds like you &apos;re dealing with a real belgian waffle .
is that a dog ?
what ? no .
that sounds like a dog .
you will do anything
to avoid hearing me talk about work , won &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just gonna go cool off downstairs . yep .
honey ?
she is right .
sometimes i don &apos;t listen .
that &apos;s what she said , right ? i don &apos;t listen ?
did you get out ?
oh , come on , now .
honey ?
sweetheart ?
i am so sorry .
it &apos;s fine , phil , really . just go back to bed .
i just ... need some time to myself .
y @-@ you know i cry when you cry .
i &apos;ll be upstairs .
you okay ?
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s been a lot .
i love you .
hey , dex . how are you ?
you okay ?
yeah , i was just admiring your garden .
hey , come on in .
so , uh , where is the rest of the gang ?
oh , they &apos;re out on a prayer jog .
it &apos;s not really my thing .
is -- is that something that happens a lot
where -- where you feel different ?
hi , dex .
hey , mitchell .
can i have you help me over here for just a second ?
uh , okay .
what are you doing ?
he was clearly reaching out .
he was admiring our garden .
nobody admires our garden .
it &apos;s a dead cactus with a grocery bag stuck to it .
what is going on with you ?
you &apos;re the one who never wants
to get involved in people &apos;s lives .
don &apos;t you see ?
he feels trapped by those guys .
oh , the big , bad bible thumpers ?
here we go again .
i &apos;m just saying you could read his song
&quot; a cry for help &quot;
as a cry for help .
mitchell , i &apos;m sorry you got chased into a lake ,
but some of the kindest , most loving ,
generous people i &apos;ve ever known were churchgoers .
just ...
come --
hey , dex , do you mind if i make a personal observation ?
if it &apos;s about my hips , blame my mother .
no , no .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s about the song that you sang yesterday .
it seemed like you were trying to express something --
some feelings you might be having
that you think might not be met with approval
from your ... &quot; community . &quot;
or it &apos;s just a song .
has nothing to do with his personal situation .
no , it does .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . your pain is real .
i just feel so guilty .
i know people will be disappointed .
no , no , don &apos;t feel guilty .
look , the first step is to say it out loud .
i don &apos;t want to be a drummer .
okay , now say the other thing .
i don &apos;t want to be in a band anymore .
i miss home .
i miss my girlfriend .
i &apos;m sorry . whoa . what ?
i &apos;m sorry . your what ?
it &apos;s like a weight has been lifted .
thank you so much , guys .
you know , i was just gonna stay inside today ,
but i &apos;m really glad i came out .
he doesn &apos;t get to say that .
oh , hey , joe .
uh , there &apos;s a new &quot; mystery kidz &quot; on .
no , thanks .
&quot; no , thanks &quot; ?
aren &apos;t you curious who stole poco &apos;s magic wings ?
not really .
but everyone &apos;s a suspect .
the watchmaker hates poco ,
and mayor pudding would do anything to stay in office .
how could you not want to see what happens ?
hello ?
uh , yes . hold on .
jay , it &apos;s reece .
you see , gloria ?
now he &apos;s calling me .
this is what i was afraid of .
he called .
my new friend called .
he &apos;s taking me to a hockey game .
great .
now i &apos;m stuck going to some boring charity event with reece .
you see what your mom got me into ?
jay , come on . keep an open mind .
all we &apos;re saying is give reece a chance .
rex .
scooby .
clifford .
what are you doing ?
trying to figure out his name .
what about dad ?
here , dad .
nope .
you do not need to figure out his name
because we &apos;re going to put these fliers up ,
and someone &apos;s gonna call .
what happened to the dinosaur bone i got for sanjay ?
i saw snoop ...
burying something in the backyard .
and you didn &apos;t do anything ?
i opened the door for him .
that bone lasted 65 million years ,
and it can &apos;t even last one day in this house ? !
claire .
oh , my god , your father !
the dog -- outside ! outside ! outside !
yeah , honey ?
sweetheart , about last night .
because i didn &apos;t listen with these two ears ...
yes .
i want to apologize with these tu @-@ lips .
oh , that is very -- that &apos;s so sweet of you .
thank you , baby .
great . oh , is that a tortilla chip right there ?
yeah --
hola , amigo from yesterday .
you &apos;re not gonna eat that , are you ?
no , that would be disgusting .
what are these ?
oh , that &apos;s a -- it &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a protein snack .
you don &apos;t have to eat that if you don &apos;t like it .
no .
i like it . good .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s liver @-@ y .
you take such good care of us .
thanks , honey .
we should get those flowers in a a vase .
no , phil .
not that vase .
look at me !
really look at me .
i feel like i am .
you &apos;re just not getting it , are you ?
i &apos;m sorry . i need some alone time .
sorry for knocking on your door so persistently ,
but we can &apos;t find dex ,
and all his matching luggage is gone .
do you have any idea where he is ?
i don-- i don &apos;t know , mitchell .
weren &apos;t you the last person to talk to him ?
and we haven &apos;t got much time .
if we don &apos;t have a drummer ,
we &apos;re gonna have to cancel the gig .
well , the lord works in mysterious ways .
don &apos;t even ...
i ...
aah , this is devastating .
if we don &apos;t play , we won &apos;t get paid ,
and we don &apos;t have enough money to get home .
hey , you don &apos;t know what dex is going through .
one hath to be true to the way one was born .
okay , you can &apos;t just add &quot; hath &quot;
and pretend it was in the bible .
well , i guess we better call the venue and cancel the gig .
oh , boy , well , you know .
i could be your drummer .
oh , god , here we go .
really ? you play ?
swear to g @-@ dash @-@ d.
just play me a few bars . i can pick it up , follow along .
mr. cameron , thank you so much .
you kind of remind me of another special someone
who made a pretty big sacrifice to save us .
please , do not compare me to your ...
mr. bernie kaufman , our manager .
he burnt down his shoe store to pay for our first demo .
what are you doing ?
oh , god , you take the dog ,
and i &apos;ll clean this up , okay ?
okay .
honey , i got some vase options .
what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
i think she saw those flowers as the shallow
transparent gesture they were
and shredded them to pieces in a justifiable rage .
yep .
what have i done to upset her so much ?
maybe you should look in a mirror
and ask yourself that question .
sweet teen wolf , what have i become ?
you see that guy ?
i have done so much work on his mouth
that he &apos;s paid for the hot tub on my boat .
did kopitar just wave to you ?
it &apos;s the least he can do .
i &apos;m taking him out fishing this weekend in catalina .
hey , hey , do you want to come ?
oh , my god , i &apos;d love to go .
oh , but ...
what ?
last night , before you got there ,
gloria and i got in a big to @-@ do
about me not needing new friends .
and now you don &apos;t want to admit you were wrong .
wow , do you get me .
well , it &apos;s supposed to be perfect whale @-@ watching weather ,
and , uh , oh , yeah ,
gretzky &apos;s coming , too .
the great one ?
not at sharing the binoculars , he isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s killing me i can &apos;t go !
well , here &apos;s a crazy idea .
why don &apos;t you tell your wife the truth
and admit you were wrong ?
you don &apos;t get me like i thought you did .
or ... ?
fine . i &apos;ll level with her .
what is going on ?
ohh , good , you &apos;re not dad .
so , how &apos;d it go with sanjay ?
did he remember your anniversary ?
you tell me .
after i gave him the fossil ,
he gave me this for romantic weekends up at stanford .
it looks kind of used .
do you think it &apos;s possible he forgot
and just grabbed the first thing that he &apos;s ...
shut up ! he loves me !
i can &apos;t believe i haven &apos;t gotten a single call .
i must have put up a thousand fliers .
hey , guys .
honey .
claire .
yeah .
i want to talk to you .
i am so sorry .
i don &apos;t listen .
i try to solve problems with flowers .
i do unflattering impressions of you for my friends .
and worst of all , i let myself go .
so i shaved and put on a suit .
oh , honey .
what &apos;s that ?
what ?
oh , my god . you packed a suitcase .
you need some time away .
i guess all this was ...
too little , too late .
well , not the spray tan . that was too much , too long .
i think the nozzle was broken .
you &apos;re getting this all wrong , and it &apos;s all my fault .
okay , look ,
i have been trying to distract you , yes ,
but because i have been thinking about what was good for me
and not what might be good for you .
so i have no idea
if we &apos;re ever gonna find out who his real owner is ,
but if we don &apos;t , you can keep him .
why would i want the tanksley &apos;s dog ?
what ?
this is buddy .
you know the tanksley &apos;s over on clifton ?
i sold them their house .
oh , thank god .
but if you &apos;re open to me getting a pet ...
yeah . of course . get a dog .
no , i don &apos;t want a dog .
i want a cockatoo to take rollerblading .
how cool would that be sitting on my shoulder
my half shirt flapping in the wind ?
you &apos;re not getting a bird .
are you serious ?
yeah .
people that have birds
and walk around with them on their shoulders --
they look ridiculous .
it &apos;s obviously a desperate cry for attention .
okay .
now i need some time to myself .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
you &apos;re watching &quot; mystery kidz . &quot;
you said you didn &apos;t want to .
not with you . you ask too many questions .
that &apos;s rude .
i was only watching as a courtesy .
what just happened ?
wait , who &apos;s that ?
gloria .
how was the charity event ?
i have to talk to you about something .
what ?
i owe you an apology .
i have to go to cleveland this weekend
for my aunt bea &apos;s funeral .
nice old lady .
fell off a cliff .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll go with you . i &apos;ll start packing right now .
no , no , no . you stay here with joe and manny .
i &apos;ll send you a snow globe .
hey , did we have an extra pair of binoculars ?
i saw a weird bird outside .
stop with the lies .
i really don &apos;t understand men .
why can &apos;t you just admit that you were wrong ?
it &apos;s not a weakness .
it &apos;s a strength ,
and i would love you and respect you more .
fine .
i like reece , and i want to go away with him .
i knew it !
i was right , and you were wrong !
from now on , we &apos;re gonna do new things all the time .
tomorrow we &apos;re going to an ethiopian restaurant ,
and then we &apos;re gonna watch a movie
about a love letter that arrived 30 years late
and changed the life of two women .
can i bring reece ?
no !
化水为酒乐队
hey , everyone , let &apos;s gather for the preshow prayer .
kind of like madonna and her backup dancers .
mr. mitchell , would you like to join us ?
oh , i &apos;m good . thank you .
all right .
heavenly father ,
we ask that you make this show super @-@ amazing for all of our fans ,
and we pray for dex .
lord , please guide him .
give him strength .
and let him know that we love and accept him no matter what .
mitchell , did you hear that ?
hey , you know what ? let me in there .
i have been a little judgmental , haven &apos;t i ?
so ...
go ahead .
amen .
amen .
let &apos;s do this .
break a leg !
thank you !
here .
what &apos;s this ?
if the mood strikes you ,
why don &apos;t you join us onstage ,
make some joyful noise ?
ladies and gentlemen , water to wine !
one , two , three , four .

i &apos;m just saying that maybe ,
before you join the french resistance ,
you walk the 15 feet to your neighbor &apos;s house
and ask her did she get your damn love letter .
for someone that says
that they don &apos;t want to talk about the movie ,
that &apos;s all you seem to be talking about .
i think it &apos;s better
than putting this yellow mush in my mouth .
yeah , maybe if you opened up your mind ,
you would see that this is actually delicious .
it was disgusting ,
but i can never let jay know that he is right .
the food is terrible and if i &apos;m being honest ,
the movie sort of stays with me .
