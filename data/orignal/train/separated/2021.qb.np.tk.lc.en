this is a copy of the letter you wrote to the district attorney
when you threatened to expose me .
you ever do send that letter , you &apos;re in the same boat as me .
you want to move in here ?
i &apos;ve only ever been here twice ,
and both times were with you .
you beat me on the dissolution negotiation ,
you get your name on the door .
if you think you &apos;re gonna win this time ,
you &apos;ve got another thing coming .
you ready to use your relationship with rachel
to get her father to turn ?
doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m not gonna do that .
folsom foods .
this is about harvey specter ,
jessica pearson , and their divorce negotiations ,
and you don &apos;t go to the one you didn &apos;t marry
to stick it to the one you did .
that &apos;s a check from folsom foods .
it &apos;s the remainder of what they owe us .
if you crush me , i &apos;ll have nothing .
he was bullying me .
so you used me to bully him back .
if you don &apos;t want to live with me ,
why don &apos;t you just tell me ?
i just need some time .
hessington oil just fired us .
scottie betrayed me .
i gave you my word , and i honored it .
something dropped from the sky ,
tilted everything in your favor right after i cut you a break ?
i am not going to dissolve this merger .
you already signed the agreement .
then sue me .
scottie didn &apos;t get us fired . ava hessington did .
she &apos;s suing all of us .
i got into stanford .
you have something to say to me ?
i &apos;m sorry , scottie .
i didn &apos;t believe you , but you were telling the truth .
why does it always have to be so--
i said i was sorry .
you didn &apos;t mean it .
i meant it .
but just because i was wrong about you betraying me
doesn &apos;t mean i was wrong to think you might have done it .
see , this is what i mean , harvey .
if you thought anything of me , you &apos;d know i &apos;d never do that .
i do think something of you ,
which is why i &apos;m going to tell you this : get out .
honor the dissolution agreement and move on .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you want me to put all the liability on edward ?
the liability belongs on edward .
so when you say that you think something of me ,
what you actually mean is you want me to help you
to bail on darby international .
scottie , when this lawsuit &apos;s over ,
there &apos;s not going to be a darby international .
you don &apos;t know that .
what i know is
you have a chance to get another job
before everything hits the fan . you won &apos;t in another week .
i won &apos;t need another job when i right the ship .
you &apos;re not going to right the ship .
if you were on that jury , the only question you &apos;d ask
is how many zeroes to put on the check .
you want me to turn my back on the man
that i &apos;ve been in the foxhole with for the last ten years .
would you do the same ?
if that man turned out to have sanctioned murder
without my knowledge and let me take the hit , i would .
well ... like it or not , you &apos;re in the foxhole with me .
so order a glass of your macallan 20 @-@ pretentious ,
and let &apos;s figure out how we &apos;re going to fight this together .
you haven &apos;t said a word all night .
are we going to talk about this or not ?
what is there to talk about ?
this is why you didn &apos;t want to decide
whether to live with me or not , right ?
well , it isn &apos;t , actually ,
but you knew that i was applying to stanford ,
and you said that you &apos;d support whatever decision i made .
i did , but then you got into columbia ,
so i thought that wouldn &apos;t matter anymore .
because stanford &apos;s in california ,
and columbia &apos;s here .
and because columbia
is an amazing school and we said we love each other .
yeah , but it &apos;s not that simple .
it sounds that simple to me .
what i mean is
i &apos;m not built the same as you .
i need to decide what school is better for me
before factoring in you or us or anything else .
and how exactly do you plan on doing that ?
the same way that i make all the important decisions in my life ,
by weighing the pros and cons of both schools .
and where does not being with me rank on that list ?
you &apos;re missing the point .
i am trying to figure out which school is best for me
in a vacuum .
no , you &apos;re missing the point .
you &apos;re trying to figure out what school is best for you
as though i didn &apos;t exist , but i do .
mike--
rachel , i &apos;m not saying
that you have to go to columbia .
we &apos;re adults . we &apos;re together .
at some point , you &apos;re going to have to factor that in too .
she go for it ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
then if scottie won &apos;t separate from us amicably ,
we &apos;ll make her do it forcibly .
jessica , i don &apos;t want to start another war with her .
then what &apos;s your idea ?
my idea is
we act like lawyers and we fight the lawsuit .
on its merits ?
edward darby sanctioned murder . we don &apos;t stand a chance .
jessica--
harvey , you know i &apos;m right ,
and it &apos;s what you told scottie--
it &apos;s the truth , and just because she can &apos;t see it
doesn &apos;t mean we have to live with it .
no , we don &apos;t .
i need you to get in a room with ava
and offer our testimony against edward
in exchange for taking our names off the lawsuit .
what about when scottie finds out ?
thanks .
11 : 08 .
you know , i could have you sanctioned
for being late to a settlement conference .
tanner , what the hell are you doing here , and how the hell
did you insinuate yourself with ava hessington ?
jealous ?
no , i just thought hessington
was in the oil business , not the snake oil business .
they diversified .
where &apos;s ava ?
ava &apos;s not here ,
because she &apos;s not interested in your offer
to testify against edward darby .
i &apos;m not the one who did this to her .
aren &apos;t you ? didn &apos;t you pull your typical bullshit
to get the original attorney thrown off this case ?
to win the damn case .
well , instead of winning it ,
it led to ava being charged with murder .
a charge i got her off of
by finding the people who were actually responsible .
sorry , harv , but that &apos;s not enough ,
i really have to go .
thank you .
donna .
oh , he &apos;s not here .
is there something that i can help you with ?
come to think of it , i &apos;m not one for office gossip ,
but i have to know .
are briscoe and linhart dating ?
oh , my god , big time ,
and it is drama with a capital &quot; d. &quot;
i knew it .
what about van giessen and schwarz ?
oh , they were , but it &apos;s done @-@ zo .
van giessen thinks schwarz got too cozy with boone .
tax law boone ?
bankruptcy boone .
i thought she was gay .
no , she &apos;s not .
what ? i knew you &apos;d know .
i always do .
how long have mike ross and rachel zane been dating ?
um , a few months .
so it &apos;s not casual ?
no , it &apos;s not .
which means he told robert zane &apos;s daughter his secret .
jessica , i know what you &apos;re thinking--
you have no idea what i &apos;m thinking .
but for now , i &apos;m thinking that you &apos;re not going to say
anything about this to either one of them .
and that &apos;s not a request .
i won &apos;t say a word .
jesus , you look like shit .
i was up all night . i couldn &apos;t sleep .
i told you i didn &apos;t need anything on tanner yet .
i &apos;m not here to talk about tanner
or the lawsuit or the merger , i just ...
i want to know how you do it .
how i do what ?
not let people in .
i need to know .
you don &apos;t know what i do and don &apos;t do .
what i know is that you seem to have relationships
again and again and they don &apos;t eat you up
or spit you out or seem to affect you at all .
i have a picture of dorian gray hanging in my closet .
导致格雷在自我放纵的泥淖中越陷越深直至彻底毁灭
it &apos;s not funny .
i wasn &apos;t joking . i was trying to get you to leave
so i could have my morning without you judging me .
harvey , i &apos;m not judging you , all right ?
i &apos;m just--i just need to know what your mind @-@ set is .
my mind @-@ set is , i don &apos;t talk about it .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i keep my personal here and my business over there .
i &apos;m happy that &apos;s working for you ,
but it doesn &apos;t seem to be working for me .
i wasn &apos;t giving you advice . i was answering your question .
you want advice , call dr. phil .
主持人菲尔是一位有博士学位的心理医生
harvey , i &apos;m not trying to attack you here , okay ?
i &apos;m struggling with something . i just--
i &apos;m trying to get you take on it .
and i &apos;m not trying to be defensive , i &apos;m just telling you
i don &apos;t know everything about everything .
look mike , you want to know how to be a lawyer ,
i &apos;m your man .
you want to know how to deal with love ,
that &apos;s not my area .
there &apos;s coffee made and bagels in the fridge .
why don &apos;t you take the morning off ?
i &apos;ve got the deposition . i got to go .
what the hell happened ?
brian galloway &apos;s weighing offers from seven different firms .
eight if you count yours .
why would you do that to me ?
is this about the mastodon exhibit ?
no , you &apos;re committed to your work
as i &apos;m committed to mine , and unless i &apos;m mistaken ,
we never made a professional commitment to each other .
sheila , i don &apos;t need a commitment
to know that what we have is special and unique .
it &apos;s not special , and it &apos;s definitely not unique .
okay , well , then i &apos;m going to ask you a question ,
and i &apos;m only going to ask it once .
do you war room with other firms ?
you &apos;re a lawyer , louis .
don &apos;t ask questions you don &apos;t want the answers to .
i don &apos;t know you are .
i &apos;m sorry you feel that way ,
but if you can &apos;t handle me seeing other firms ,
then maybe you &apos;re not the man that i thought you were ,
and maybe you don &apos;t deserve brian galloway .
deserve him ?
you don &apos;t get to make that determination .
yes , i do . i &apos;m sheila amanda sazs ,
and if i say you don &apos;t deserve him ,
you don &apos;t get to have him .
i don &apos;t care who you are .
if i want him , i can have him ,
and i &apos;m going to take him six ways from sunday
and there &apos;s nothing you can do to stop me .
yes , there is ,
because when i &apos;m done talking to him ,
there &apos;s no way on earth he &apos;ll end up at pearson darby specter
or whatever bullshit name
you guys are calling yourselves this week .
now , get out of my way . i have a plane to catch .
you &apos;re early .
so are you .
i should have known something like this was coming
when you left without saying a word .
what did you expect , a fruit basket
for getting me out of a crime your firm committed ?
ava , i know travis tanner fed you a line
to get your business , but--
mr. tanner didn &apos;t feed me anything .
this is the result of your actions .
wait a second , you really did go to him ?
i looked into you when i was deciding to hire you .
you think i wouldn &apos;t do the same thing again
when i decided to come after you ?
when you looked into me ,
you found out that whatever i do
i do it to win , and that &apos;s all i ever did for you .
what you did was intimidate people
and what it did was backfire onto me .
well , now i &apos;ve found someone you can &apos;t intimidate ,
and it &apos;s backfiring onto you .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i don &apos;t need to be here for this .
so you came here just to vent at me ?
i came here to see if you were at all sorry
about the way you handled my case .
i see that you aren &apos;t .
though i imagine you will be
once mr. tanner gets through with you .
feels like old times .
lot of good memories in this room .
bring back the taste of blood in your mouth ?
oh , i &apos;m a shark , harvey . i love the taste of blood .
speaking of which , when you accepted this case ,
did you make a side deal with edward darby
where he agreed to make you
managing partner over jessica pearson if you won ?
yes , i did ,
but that isn &apos;t a side deal . that &apos;s an incentive .
what it is is a conflict of interest .
that is not true .
if anything , it made harvey work harder for ava .
whatever gets you through the night .
the truth is , edward darby doesn &apos;t make that deal
the time for words is over . the time for deeds is now .
well , then give me a deed , i &apos;ll do it .
give me a mountain , i &apos;ll climb it .
gimme a katy perry song , i &apos;ll sing it .
your only deed is for you to get off the phone
and figure out where i &apos;ll be tomorrow night ,
so you can tell me what you need to tell me .
okay , can i just have some sort of--
hello ?
good to see you , tanner .
hello , harvey .
what do you got in your hand there ?
it &apos;s an arrest warrant for your father .
turns out he did a little insider trading a few years ago ,
and i pulled some strings .
bullshit .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m lying ,
just like stephen huntley did on his affidavit ,
and we &apos;ve got proof .
well , look who decided to show up .
i was waiting for you to get some points on the board .
now we can start having some fun .
nice try , tanner , but that affidavit was bullshit ,
now you got nothing to back up your bullshit on scottie .
you think i need backup ?
it wasn &apos;t about her . it was about you .
i &apos;m going to drag her ass through the mud
left , right , and center , and when i &apos;m done with her ,
there &apos;s not a firm that &apos;ll touch her with a 10 @-@ foot pole .
what the hell happened to you ? why are you doing this , tanner ?
i &apos;m doing it for my client .
you actually had me thinking if we ever met again--
that i &apos;d fight fair ?
i do in the ring , but this isn &apos;t the ring ,
and you know very well that you can stop me anytime you want .
if i settle .
there are lot of zeroes on that offer .
you just need to decide whether you care more about money
or your girlfriend .
donna told me that stephen &apos;s affidavit is dead .
it is , but it doesn &apos;t matter , because tanner &apos;s
gonna keep coming after you unless we sign this .
you &apos;ll never sign this .
scottie , you may not believe this ,
but if the decision were mine , i would .
jessica-- she wouldn &apos;t even consider it .
i should have known .
this is about you getting me to split you off from edward
so you can convince ava to stop coming after you .
this isn &apos;t about that .
then what is it about ?
i can &apos;t stand to see them come after you .
bullshit !
it &apos;s not bullshit .
you think i can &apos;t take it !
look , you &apos;re not listening to me , okay ?
i can &apos;t take it !
scottie , tanner can only come after you
if ava lets him come after you ,
and ava &apos;s only letting him come after you to get to me .
take the shackles off and let me convince her
this fight isn &apos;t with me , it &apos;s with edward .
okay , harvey .
okay , you win .
shackles are off .
hi .
hey .
there &apos;s something that i need to tell you , and ...
i really don &apos;t want to .
okay . you &apos;re scaring me .
jessica came by my place this morning .
she knows about us .
she does .
she says that you &apos;re robert zane &apos;s daughter ,
and if you want to stay at the firm ...
you need to sign an affidavit .
saying what ?
that you know i &apos;m a fraud .
well , what if i don &apos;t sign it ?
then she &apos;ll fire me .
i don &apos;t believe that . you &apos;ve got leverage .
no , that just stops her from exposing me , not firing me .
bullshit .
no , it &apos;s not bullshit .
if she fires me , what am i gonna to do ,
run to the d.a. ?
have them throw me in jail just to get her back ?
i &apos;m not going to do that , and she knows it .
can &apos;t stand that i put you in this position .
and the only way i can see out of this is ...
for you to go to stanford .
ms hessington , when we first met ,
did you admit you bribed a foreign government
to get your pipeline ?
i pled guilty .
i didn &apos;t ask you what you pled .
i asked if you did it .
that &apos;s privileged .
your client forfeited privilege when she sued me .
keep that in mind .
my client &apos;s not suing you .
she &apos;s suing pearson darby specter .
there is no pearson darby specter .
we split .
edward darby wouldn &apos;t allow that .
edward darby doesn &apos;t have the power to stop it .
but i do , but i &apos;m not going to let you make them suffer
for what darby did .
hell of a performance , harvey .
back @-@ up singers and everything .
it &apos;s still not going to stop us .
and he isn &apos;t making them suffer .
i am for what he did to me .
did what to you ? get you a slap on the wrist
for your original bribery charges ,
get you off murder ,
or stop you from bribing witnesses ?
which brings me to my next question .
did you fire me for refusing to bribe witnesses on your behalf ?
you &apos;re under oath .
don &apos;t answer that .
i wouldn &apos;t . it &apos;s a federal crime .
she doesn &apos;t have to . like i said ,
we &apos;re not bound by privilege and i &apos;ve got three witnesses ,
including your friend stephen huntley
who testified to it in open court .
you want to throw stones , ava ? we &apos;ve got some rocks of our own .
what are you doing , harvey ?
i &apos;m talking to your client off the record .
no , no , no . on the record , or not at all .
no , let him speak .
i want to hear what he &apos;s got to say .
ava , you can come at us
and we can come at you .
i don &apos;t want that .
you wanted to know if i &apos;m sorry . i am .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t listen to you ,
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t believe you ,
i am sorry that my history with cameron
put a target on your back ,
but i am not sorry that i did everything in my power
to help you every chance i got .
if you don &apos;t believe that , then keep coming .
but if you do ,
i &apos;m asking , put your anger where it belongs .
tanner , i hope you still have that quarter i gave you ,
&apos;cause i think it &apos;s time to call your mom .
harvey .
fantastic .
i hear we won .
ava or you ?
we both know you tracked her down
because of your lifelong , never @-@ gonna @-@ happen dream
to beat me .
i never heard of
ava hessington until she walked through my door .
bullshit . you have a subscription
to harvey specter monthly , and i know it .
okay , you got me .
i knew exactly who she was
the second she walked through my door--
my chance to take your lunch money .
well , let me make you an advance payment .
why don &apos;t you use this
to call your mom and tell her to get the tissues ready ,
because you &apos;re 0 @-@ 2 against me ,
and the 0 isn &apos;t the number that &apos;s going to change .
we should have known
tanner was behind this whole thing .
according to tanner ,
ava went to him , not the other way around .
you believe that shit ?
not for a second .
who am i putting in the cross hairs ,
tanner or ava ?
at the moment , no one .
tanner &apos;s going to depose me , then we &apos;ll see what we see .
come on , harvey , you got to give me one of them .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you got girlfriend troubles , don &apos;t you ?
okay , i &apos;m just asking for an assignment , that &apos;s all .
don &apos;t tell me , quarterback asked her to the prom ?
okay , first of all , i specifically haven &apos;t
bothered you with any of this .
until now .
i was just asking for an assignment .
captain pinstripe &apos;s the one who brought up the girlfriend ,
and second of all , people actually had girlfriends
after high school , which you wouldn &apos;t know ,
because emotionally , you never graduated .
well , i guess you &apos;re the expert ,
because the only thing you graduated from is high school .
why you got to go there , man ?
this predicts a candidate &apos;s success rate ,
and then this cross @-@ references it
with your firm &apos;s employment needs .
wait a second , you &apos;re running two programs at the same time ?
yeah , i don &apos;t bend over backwards for just anyone .
hold on to that thought .
in the meantime , i need you to put this guy on the list .
uh @-@ huh . i already did .
would you look at this place ?
i mean , it &apos;s like a war room in here .
mm @-@ hmm . speaking of wartime ,
i &apos;m in the mood to do battle in the bedroom .
not now !
muddles my mind . i need to focus .
i get it , you want to keep looking at candidates .
yeah .
check out this bad boy right here .
where &apos;d you get this ?
harvard archives .
think this guy &apos;s partner material ?
i &apos;m ready to go to the other room .
thought that &apos;d do the trick .
we should bring this in , tape it to the wall .
there &apos;s already 50 taped to the ceiling .
you won &apos;t be looking at the ceiling .
you want this guy to join us ?
we &apos;re running out of time .
tanner &apos;s deposing harvey . we need to talk about it .
who &apos;s going to handle it ?
i am .
i don &apos;t want to step on your toes ,
but don &apos;t we want to consider outside counsel ?
we &apos;ve gone down that road before .
turns out harvey doesn &apos;t play well with others .
don &apos;t i know it .
but i still think it &apos;s a good idea
to have outside counsel in that room .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
to have anyone else in that room .
so you brought me in here to tell me
that you don &apos;t want me to be a part of it ?
i brought you in here to tell you to keep your cool .
i appreciate the condescending words of wisdom , but i &apos;ve sat in
on about 1,000 depositions and i &apos;ve never broken a sweat .
you &apos;ve never sat in one with travis tanner .
you &apos;re gonna need a thick skin ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s gonna try to get under it .
i &apos;m not the one being deposed .
doesn &apos;t matter .
last time he deposed harvey ,
it ended with harvey punching him in the face .
that &apos;s harvey , not me .
and if harvey hadn &apos;t done it , i might have .
what are you talking about ?
tanner knew all about harvey &apos;s mother .
came with a whole story about how i &apos;m harvey &apos;s mother
and what harvey wants to do to his mother ,
and that story was bullshit .
i get it .
he &apos;s not going to need a bullshit story with me .
stanford class schedule and a list of every flight
from here to northern california .
i would get a lot of time off , and it &apos;s really not that far .
so i guess this means you &apos;ve made your decision .
mike , i need you to listen to me .
i love you . that &apos;s over here .
i need to decide where i want to go to school .
that &apos;s over here . but i want to be with you
no matter what , and that &apos;s in here .
i &apos;m on board with that , rachel ,
there &apos;s just one problem .
if you say that long @-@ distance relationships don &apos;t work--
i know , you don &apos;t want to hear it .
because we &apos;re not most people .
i don &apos;t know anyone that has ever
made a long @-@ distance relationship work .
do you ?
mike , i need to be able to breathe
to make this decision .
i &apos;m not the one that &apos;s making it that you can &apos;t .
the facts are , but the facts aren &apos;t going to change .
you choose to go to stanford , most likely it means we &apos;re done .
i don &apos;t think you could be any better than that .
it &apos;s like you read my mind .
i have a reward for you .
oh , please , if it &apos;s a picture of me as an astronaut ,
i can &apos;t right now .
brian galloway .
top of his class , law review , and one cutthroat mother--
oh , my god , he &apos;s perfect .
you were hiding him from me ?
i &apos;ve been saving him for you .
now , louis , let &apos;s you and i
take the rest of the day off .
the rest of the day ?
yeah , we can play hooky .
it &apos;ll be fun .
there &apos;s a mastodon exhibit on loan from bangkok .
sheila ! you know that i can &apos;t
be unfaithful to my firm like that .
i mean , it &apos;s bad enough we took a 77 @-@ minute break
to do what we just did .
i understand .
you &apos;re dedicated to your work .
it &apos;s one of the things that i admire about you .
thank you .
in fact , unless you have any other candidates for me ,
unless you have leverage . you knew darby couldn &apos;t lose
because stephen huntley &apos;s murders
would be discovered . isn &apos;t that correct ?
no , it isn &apos;t .
so prior to her trial starting ,
you didn &apos;t know
that stephen huntley orchestrated those murders ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
what if i told you
i have evidence that you did ?
i &apos;d say you &apos;re full of shit .
and whether he knew or not is irrelevant ,
since edward darby stipulated that he knew ,
making mr. specter liable anyway .
oh , it &apos;s relevant ,
because two days ago , mr. specter tried to cut a deal
to split off from edward darby behind your back .
oh , i see . harvey didn &apos;t tell you .
if harvey had told me ,
it wouldn &apos;t be going behind my back ,
and i &apos;m not going to blame him for doing what &apos;s in his nature
any more than i &apos;d blame you for being an asshole .
ooh . feisty and hot .
now i get why he can &apos;t stay away from you .
tanner , last time , harvey knocked you out .
you don &apos;t start acting like a human being this time ,
you &apos;re gonna have to deal with me .
hey , i &apos;m not the one
who screwed my old girlfriend
while she was engaged .
kind of a dick move , harv .
that &apos;s enough .
wait a second .
how come she jumped in , and you didn &apos;t ?
she didn &apos;t tell you she was engaged .
can &apos;t trust the hot ones .
come after me , tanner .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re here for .
oh . i get it . you actually care about her .
i think i &apos;ve gotten everything i need right now ,
but since it was so much fun ,
i &apos;m going to go ahead
and reserve the right to do this again .
hey , do you have a minute ?
of course .
just wondering if maybe you had a copy of harvey &apos;s deposition .
can &apos;t you just get one from harvey ?
i could ,
but then i wouldn &apos;t be able to show you
how i &apos;m letting you have all your space .
this is space ?
yeah , i mean , i &apos;m all the way over here ,
being all space @-@ giving
and adorable .
as opposed to what you really want to be doing ,
which is looking at
my pros and cons list for columbia and stanford .
no , it actually isn &apos;t .
that list is for you .
it &apos;s part of your process , and i &apos;m gonna respect it .
what changed your mind ?
i went to see harvey this morning .
harvey gave you advice ?
no .
and yes .
i just realized that if i go his way ,
i am gonna lose you .
but if i keep going mine ,
i &apos;m gonna push you away .
so make your decision , and i &apos;ll give you your space .
thank you .
you go to stanford ... we &apos;ll beat the odds .
son of a bitch .
i &apos;m sorry you had to sit through that personal attack .
oh , you think that &apos;s what i &apos;m pissed about ?
you tried to cut a deal
that would screw edward and me in process .
i tried to include you . you said no .
oh , you think that makes it any better ?
scottie , all this is
is tanner trying to get us to fight among ourselves .
well , he &apos;s doing a damn good job of it .
you think he didn &apos;t say some things in there that got to me too ?
well , i &apos;m not bringing them up ,
because right now , we need to stick together .
sticking together means telling the truth ,
so tell me ,
whose idea was it to cut that deal ,
yours or jessica &apos;s ?
it was hers , and i didn &apos;t want to go behind your back
just like you didn &apos;t want to go behind darby &apos;s ,
but i did because in the end ,
i knew i didn &apos;t have a choice .
and neither do you ,
you just haven &apos;t seen that yet .
mike , i need your help .
ok , what is it , louis ?
i need to you convince brian galloway to come here .
who ?
the top associate candidate of this year &apos;s class .
stick with me .
oh , yeah , brian galloway .
harvard , editor of the law review .
welcome to the conversation .
please tell me you knew him .
no , i didn &apos;t .
damn it !
louis , he wasn &apos;t my year .
you &apos;ve already got katrina .
what &apos;s so important about getting this guy to come here ?
mike , no , no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not about him .
it &apos;s about sheila sazs .
oh , yeah ? what about it ? i mean her .
mike , come on , don &apos;t be coy with me .
everyone in new york knows about our torrid affair .
yeah , of course . torrid .
she had it all set up for him to come here ,
and out of the clear , blue sky ,
she &apos;s no longer going to be exclusive with us .
there &apos;s nothing you did ?
no .
she asked me to take the day off , i said no .
next thing i knew
she was saying that our relationship wasn &apos;t special
and that she was free to see other firms .
okay , louis , i &apos;m sorry ,
but is it possible that this has nothing to do with work
and what she &apos;s actually saying
is that she wants to be exclusive with you ?
oh , mike , you &apos;re so silly .
you know nothing about women .
if she wanted to be exclusive with me ,
she would just come right out and say it .
holy shit , it was staring at me right in the face .
not necessarily .
i &apos;ve just been using her for her candidates ,
i &apos;ve just been wham , bam , candidate ma &apos;am .
okay .
i mean , any woman
who &apos;s been repeatedly litt up
would demand exclusive dominion over my body .
now , get out of my way . i have a letter to compose .
i &apos;m ...
not in your way .
hello , scottie .
tanner .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i just came to bring you a coffee in the morning .
after meeting you , i &apos;d say there &apos;s an 80 % chance
there &apos;s a roofie in there .
no roofie .
just a skinny vanilla latte with extra whip and a shot of caramel .
you looked up my favorite drink ?
it &apos;s all part of the package .
you &apos;re here to split me off from harvey ?
well , he did the same to you .
and you wouldn &apos;t even know about it if it weren &apos;t for me .
you &apos;re a regular mother teresa .
look , i just came to tell you that
we can take it easy on you
if you &apos;ll just maybe say that harvey
knew about stephen huntley two months ago .
that would be a lie .
maybe it would just be conjecture presented as fact .
look , i &apos;m gonna say because you already know it .
i betrayed harvey once .
it &apos;s never going to happen again .
okay , well , then i &apos;ll just have to
hear your side of the story at your deposition .
ms. scott , to your knowledge ,
did harvey specter want this merger ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
and did you try
to force it on him because you &apos;d lost to him
numerous times and you wanted to get him back ?
you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s trying to get harvey back
for losing , tanner .
and i &apos;m about to be successful .
isn &apos;t it true that while you were engaged ,
you came to new york and slept with harvey specter
in an attempt to get him to tell you he loved you
and he said no ?
that is utter conjecture .
that &apos;s why we have these depositions ,
so i can ask questions about things i &apos;m conjecturing .
you &apos;re not asking questions . you &apos;re throwing mud .
am i ? the facts are ,
you had a relationship with him in law school ,
you worked a case against him ,
and shortly thereafter , ended your relationship .
it doesn &apos;t take a rocket scientist to connect the dots .
tanner--
did you really think
that you could domesticate him ? a house in westchester ,
harvey flipping burgers on the weekends ?
what kind of fantasy land were you living in ?
tanner , that &apos;s enough .
she &apos;s not answering this line of questioning .
then i &apos;ll answer it for her .
you loved him , he spurned you ,
and you set this whole thing up to get him back .
that &apos;s insane .
which part ? that you loved him ?
that he spurned you ?
nothing ? wow , i guess they &apos;re both true .
we &apos;re just not supposed to believe
that you set this merger up out of anger
because you knew what was coming down the pike .
i had no idea what was coming down the pike .
oh , so you &apos;re telling me that edward darby knew
but his number two didn &apos;t know ?
i was not the only one that edward darby relied on .
he relied on stephen huntley for what happened in the e.i.r. ,
and they both kept it from me .
then why am i holding this affidavit
with stephen huntley &apos;s name on it
stating you knew everything ?
because he &apos;s a lying son of a bitch ,
and you &apos;re a piece of shit ,
and this is the end of this deposition .
what you doing ?
you know what i &apos;m doing .
if you want to keep your mind off rachel ,
try reading scottie &apos;s deposition .
i did .
that must have been brutal for her .
must have been brutal for harvey .
from what i &apos;ve seen , not much is .
mike , he &apos;s not as hard as you think .
why are you talking to me about this ?
because if i asked harvey what i &apos;m about to ask you--
he &apos;d say no .
i want to talk to stephen .
donna , not a good idea .
mike , please .
i can &apos;t just let him hurt somebody else
and do nothing about it .
so this is just about protecting scottie ?
i &apos;m not just protecting scottie .
i &apos;m protecting harvey ,
because he may not know how he feels , but i do .
i was told my attorney was here to see me .
i &apos;m sorry , should have said &quot; an attorney &apos;s here to see you . &quot;
you lied , so we lied .
see you got my affidavit .
well written , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
so is lord of the rings ,
but you know what they both are ? fiction .
what did tanner offer you to sign that ?
he didn &apos;t offer me anything .
bullshit . tanner &apos;s a liar and a snake
and he doesn &apos;t do anything without a reason .
so you say , but i wouldn &apos;t know him
from a hole in the ground .
he came to me with an opportunity ,
and i took it .
how is making up a load of shit about dana scott
an opportunity ?
i didn &apos;t make up anything .
what i wrote was that she was the conduit
between edward and i.
she was my boss . that is factually correct .
that &apos;s a misleading statement designed to confuse a jury
in your murder trial so that you can claim
edward &apos;s testimony is a lie .
it is a lie .
we never had the conversation he said we had .
mike . can you give us a minute ?
you told me i was wrong about you .
how can you do this ?
donna , my life is on the line .
so you &apos;ll drag as many people down
as you have to to save yourself ?
her freedom isn &apos;t at stake .
no , but her reputation is .
she &apos;ll survive .
you &apos;re lying about her .
yeah , i am .
stephen , i &apos;m gonna ask you this one more time .
if anything you ever said to me was true , please don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry , donna . i have to .
you get what we need ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
actually , i did .
what are you talking about ?
you might not know this , but every conversation
in this particular facility is recorded ,
with an exception made for attorney @-@ client privilege .
and as you pointed out , we &apos;re not your attorneys .
jessica .
expecting someone else ?
i--um-- .
nice place . can i come in ?
yeah , of course .
do you want some cheerios ?
what would captain crunch say ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
we wouldn &apos;t want to cross him .
i &apos;ve never seen you wear this at the office .
something i should know ?
yeah , that &apos;s not--
i know , and i know whose it is ,
and that &apos;s exactly why i &apos;m here .
you told robert zane &apos;s daughter my business .
look , she &apos;s not gonna tell anyone .
i know .
because you &apos;re going to get her to sign this .
this puts her in jeopardy .
you put her in jeopardy .
and if i won &apos;t do it ?
then you won &apos;t be working for me anymore .
i got your letter .
and ?
you drafted a legal document .
that outlines my exclusivity proposal .
this is the least romantic thing ever .
you couldn &apos;t have the courtesy to do it in person ?
i sent it fedex , sheila . it got there overnight .
p.m. delivery .
a.m. delivery is a scam , sheila .
it gets there at the same time anyway .
okay , you know what &apos;s a scam ? this letter ,
which i am now ripping up .
no ! sheila , please !
i labored over every word of that .
we knocked the son of a bitch out of the park .
congratulations .
congratulations to you .
i hear you &apos;re representing stephen huntley now .
yeah . might as well be .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means we sat and had drinks when we thought ava was guilty .
now stephen is . what &apos;s the difference ?
guess your morning off didn &apos;t do the trick .
what are we doing here , harvey ?
we spend every minute of our lives in this office
fighting with each other over meaningless shit
for clients that we don &apos;t even know ,
and then when some real connection comes along ,
just some little piece of happiness--
mike .
i &apos;m sorry .
did she tell you what she did ?
rachel ?
i guess not .
jessica &apos;s basically forcing her to go to stanford
instead of columbia .
she found out about you two .
i don &apos;t want her to go .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
come in .
i want to talk to you about ... this .
i see you haven &apos;t signed it .
no , i haven &apos;t .
then you must want something , because you wouldn &apos;t be here
just to tell me you weren &apos;t going to sign it .
mike said you were worried that robert zane &apos;s daughter knew his secret ,
which got me thinking about my father
and something he &apos;s always said .
which is ?
don &apos;t sign anything
unless you can get something in return .
it &apos;s called consideration .
i know what it &apos;s called .
what do you want ?
you want me to guarantee that i won &apos;t do something
that i would never do .
i want you to guarantee that you will do something
that you thought you would never do but should do .
i can &apos;t wait to hear this .
waive the harvard rule for me .
you &apos;re not even a lawyer .
but i will be ,
and when i am , i want to work here .
the harvard rule
is the longest @-@ standing rule we have .
i have been killing it here for the better part of a decade .
i &apos;m better than most of the associates in that bullpen
and i haven &apos;t even gone to law school yet ,
so imagine what it &apos;ll be like once i have .
you are your father &apos;s daughter .
yes , i am .
but i don &apos;t want to work for him .
i want to work for you .
to kicking travis tanner &apos;s ass .
you got that right .
that was a pretty great meal .
couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
i know , i taught you how to make it .
right after we crushed the bar .
i also remember what happened later that night .
it was a pretty great night .
harvey .
why am i here ?
well , i haven &apos;t cooked anyone dinner for a while ,
and i thought you deserved it .
i did ,
but you &apos;ve made it clear that you don &apos;t want more ,
and i don &apos;t want to go back to the way it was , so ...
i want to work with you .
what ?
you &apos;ve been associated with the name darby too long .
i can help you .
i don &apos;t need your help . i &apos;ll be fine .
no , you won &apos;t , and all that stuff about tanner
coming after you and me not being able to take it ,
it was true . i care about you .
come to pearson specter .
i know that you care about me .
you have made that very clear ,
but i am not interested
in working with someone day in and day out
where all they can manage to say is , &quot; i care about you . &quot;
is that all i &apos;ve ever said ?
actually , yes ,
over and over again , &quot; i care about you . &quot;
just what every girl wants to hear .
scottie , that &apos;s--
no , no , no .
if all you want to do is work with me ,
i can find a job somewhere else .
it &apos;s the best i--
sorry , i should just go . i don &apos;t--
scottie , that &apos;s not all i want .
then say it .
i want you in my life .
hi .
hi .
thought you didn &apos;t like coming down here .
can i come in ?
yeah , of course .
i finished my list .
and ?
stanford .
it &apos;s the better fit .
rachel , look--
i don &apos;t need a list to tell me
that i don &apos;t want to be without you .
you &apos;re staying ?
just try and stop me .
you were messing with me .
you got me .
i got ...
you !
you got me !
how did you find me ?
you &apos;re like me , a gladiator of your profession ,
and ... this is your arena .
this place has every harvard law student file ever .
it &apos;s like home for me .
and ... it &apos;s where you wanted me to say ...
sheila amanda sazs , i want to be exclusive with you .
and i want to be exclusive with you .
yes .
yes .
a thousand times yes .
we &apos;re gonna make love .
and eat this picnic .
in no particular order .
wait . first , i &apos;m gonna call my mother .
yeah ?
yeah .
to tell her the good news ?
to tell her you stopped being a pussy .
do not touch any of the files in here .
will you smack me if i do ?
louis ,
this is not a joke .
you &apos;re not even supposed to be in here .
for the love of god , forgive me , sheila .
you gotta be kidding me .
harvey specter .
what a douche .
mike ross .
r @-@ o , r @-@ o , r @-@ o. &quot; r @-@ o . &quot;
&quot; richardson ... james ross ... &quot;
matthew ross . what the hell ?
mike ross ?
he &apos;s not here .
