thank you .
i lived out of a hotel once .
once ?
figured you probably stayed in a lot of hotels
during your ... indiscriminate youth .
i spent most of my time on the move .
well , what was different about this hotel ?
the palazzo sasso in ravello .
it &apos;s the height of the renaissance frozen in time .
with jacuzzis and hot @-@ stone massage .
cloisters at the villa cimbrone a few minutes away .
in another life , i &apos;d have stayed there forever .
sounds perfect . why &apos;d you leave ?
i got word that europol was closing in
for a score i allegedly ran in corsica .
indiscriminate youth .
well , hotel living is fine ,
but i will be very happy when renovations are over
and i can get back into my apartment .
are you getting tired of roughing it in the lap of luxury ?
i prefer to be somewhere
where &quot; do not disturb &quot; is standard policy
and where i don &apos;t have to pull money to tip every day ,
as grateful as i am to the boys in the burgundy blazers .
back up there , sticky fingers .
okay .
if you think that &apos;ll help .
you think you can guess my pin ?
no . i can deduce it .
really ?
would you like to make a wager ?
loser tips for the rest of the day .
generously ?
of course .
you &apos;re on .
your birthday is november 11th .
11 @-@ 11
but you grew up at 7310 lake street .
good listener , but you &apos;re not even close .
your first car was a red chevy nova .
so ?
so the 4th and 9th position
in the vin number tell you the vehicle make .
you &apos;re insane .
and ...
you &apos;re a scorpio .
you have no idea .
that &apos;s impossible . i picked a random number .
well , there &apos;s no such thing as random .
your subconscious is always back there , working .
or you saw the reflection in the camera guard .
or i might have done that .
neal , what &apos;d you do ?
nothing . i entered the pin .
neal , my account is empty .
10 : 30 this morning ,
manhattan mutual bank lost control of its server .
within an hour , they were out $ 125 million .
that didn &apos;t all come from sara .
no . thousands of customers got hit .
that &apos;s too many to compromise
with classic phishing techniques .
we &apos;re thinking computer virus .
our best guess is a trojan
camped out in the server &apos;s boot sector .
it captured administrative domain credentials
and converted the entire intranet into a botnet .
in the common vernacular ,
the virus took over every computer in the network .
our thief was gracious enough
to leave an explanation for the crime .
30 minutes -- manhattan mutual &apos;s website
was replaced with this .
what the hell ? is that a mask ?
members of an interned world ,
too long have we suffered bureaucracy ,
a corpulent infant
with which the masses have greedily procreated .
today we strike a blow
against the dysfunction we call world finance .
it goes on like this .
we know who &apos;s behind it ?
we have a theory .
this morning , the swiss financial authority
reported a cash transfer into the account of cameron duponte .
the deposit matches the amount stolen ,
but we think duponte is a cover .
there &apos;s no record of him before a few months ago .
this is a list of manhattan mutual clients who got hit .
this isn &apos;t just investment bankers and c.e.o.s
we &apos;ve got pensioners , public servants .
that &apos;s a lot of people without a backup plan .
a lot of people , which means this case takes top priority .
jones , maybe there &apos;s a language in the virus
that can point us to the programmer .
diana , call up zurich .
we need access to the duponte account .
that &apos;s it .
so ?
i got good news and bad news .
we traced the money to a swiss bank .
is that the good news or the bad news ?
both .
until we prove something definitively ,
the account &apos;s untouchable .
well , great -- in my experience ,
if the criminal &apos;s not caught before the money &apos;s spent ,
then those dollars are never coming back .
which is why i intend to catch him , sara .
thank you .
are you okay in the short term ?
well , this guy took everything .
and the fdic has me filling out all sorts of paperwork .
we know how long insurance claims take .
yes , with this many victims and different account types ,
could be months .
my apartment is fully under construction ,
so until i pull my next commission check ...
you could stay with me .
you know , till this is cleared up .
uh ... at june &apos;s ?
you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
well , it &apos;s not the four seasons , but ...
i can bring you food on a little cart .
okay .
i remember when elizabeth moved in .
no . no . this is temporary .
yep . so was el .
sorry . the place is a little bit of a mess .
neal , what would you estimate the value of -- - moz .
sara .
hello .
welcome .
i hope we didn &apos;t interrupt you .
i was , um ... looking at porn .
at the dining room table ?
of someone else &apos;s home ?
well , you live your life .
and i see now you &apos;re living in mine .
i wasn &apos;t informed you were moving in .
she &apos;s not moving in .
you heard about the manhattan mutual hack ?
of course . it was a masterstroke .
whoever &apos;s behind that shredded paper mask
is a bona fide genius .
thank you , moz . sara got cleaned out .
she &apos;s staying here until the money &apos;s recovered .
oh , so we have a roommate .
&quot; we &quot; ?
i was unaware it was a package deal .
it &apos;s ...
i &apos;m gonna put some things away .
you two can chat .
porn ? really ?
i panicked .
i couldn &apos;t put her out on the street .
neal , this is hardly the time to revitalize chivalry .
what about the four seasons ?
it &apos;s a little out of my price range .
when we get to sell our treasure ,
there will be countries in your price range .
we have secrets here .
all right , relax -- as soon as we catch this guy ,
everything will get back to normal .
did you miss me ?
uh , sara , neal and i were discussing your predicament .
and i would like to offer my assistance .
so you want to get rid of me .
&quot; po @-@ tay @-@ to , &quot; &quot; po @-@ tah @-@ to . &quot;
let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s solve the case .
all right .
the thief parked the take in a swiss bank
under an alias -- cameron duponte .
duponte is a specter .
the fbi barely knows where to start .
oh , that &apos;s where we have an advantage over the feds .
we have a keen grasp of the criminal mind .
okay , say i &apos;ve stolen an incalculable fortune
and secreted it away .
and every few hours , i go online to ogle my prize .
let &apos;s say you do that .
what &apos;s the worst thing i could see ?
the treasure disappearing .
right .
now , if uncle sam can &apos;t get at duponte &apos;s account , who can ?
duponte .
but he doesn &apos;t exist .
not yet .
we can create him .
we can go into a local branch of his bank
and pretend to be duponte .
they &apos;ll have security questions .
that &apos;s just a hiccup .
we could trade his data for our data .
once we get control of the account ...
we start spending .
the thief has to come out of hiding to stop us
or watch his money vanish .
so ... we &apos;re talking about international bank fraud ...
... federal grand larceny , synthetic identity theft --
don &apos;t forget conspiracy .
okay .
all in hopes
of convincing some psycho to come after us ?
concisely stated .
look , you said if we don &apos;t catch him soon , the money &apos;s gone .
okay , it could work .
it will work .
then there &apos;s really only one question .
how are we gonna spend 100 million dollars ?
what do you think ?
do i look like monsieur duponte ?
you are a veritable master of disguise .
zip me up ?
you know , helping you dress seems so counterproductive .
monsieur duponte !
if only we didn &apos;t have a previous engagement .
neal ... mm ?
there was a box on the bed .
the banker &apos;s box ?
yes .
yeah , i moved it .
where ?
right there .
that is a box of sterling bosch case files ,
which means it is very off @-@ limits .
ooh . now you got me curious .
stop it . i &apos;m serious . all right ? some things are private .
i thought this was about not having any secrets .
okay , well , then what about
the exceptionally well @-@ forged passport
that is behind that painting ?
you searched my apartment ?
no . you left it open .
and now you &apos;re changing the subject .
they &apos;re work @-@ related .
so peter knows about them ?
let &apos;s just say he wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
so you &apos;re not skipping town ?
look , there are a lot of reasons
someone in my position would need a good alias .
you know what ?
ask mr. duponte .
okay ?
okay .
come on .
but you &apos;re keeping your hands off my banker &apos;s box .
oh , yeah ? mm @-@ hmm . we &apos;ll see about that .
you &apos;re trouble .
you found something in the virus ?
oh , did i.
okay , so , line 2,219 is an unreachable script .
a portion of the code that the program has no way of executing .
yes , the program can &apos;t execute it ,
but looks what happens when i treat the code as an object file .
boom . we get an image .
the vulture . mm @-@ hmm .
one of cyber crimes &apos; top 10 most wanted .
pendergrass talked to the vulture for six months
before he realized he was getting strung along .
well , hackers like that can smell a trap
right through the fiber optics .
so , we have a name but no face .
and the vulture &apos;s got $ 125 million
that doesn &apos;t belong to him .
so , the first number on autodial
is marjorie , the head of accounts .
and second is jacob , her assistant .
now , this bank i.d. badge should lend you an air of credibility .
oh . are we concerned about cameras ?
well , if we do this right ,
there &apos;ll be no need to check the video .
how long to replace the account info ?
well , once i have the daily clearance code , five minutes .
five minutes , i can deftly provide .
then i use the new account information
to verify myself as duponte .
let &apos;s get your money back .
marjorie cowell .
hi , i &apos;m interested in opening
a combined mma and checking account .
my name is timothy blackhouse astor iv .
of the astors ?
that &apos;s right , marjorie .
of course , mr. astor .
let &apos;s get you set up .
hi . can i help you , sir ?
i represent the office of the federal comptroller .
kindly escort me to your accounts manager .
i &apos;ll be shifting accounts
from several different financial institutions .
there &apos;s no need to herd me .
where &apos;s marjorie cowell ?
uh , mr. astor , can i please put you on hold for a moment ?
certainly .
great .
hello .
can i help you ?
uh , marjorie cowell ?
yes .
having determined that the requirements of rule 17 were satisfied ,
we turn to the claim that the subpoena should be quashed
because it demands that
&quot; it would be inconsistent with the public interest to produce . &quot;
sir . sir , can you please keep your voice down , please ?
uh , first contention is a broad claim that the separation of powers doctrine
precludes judicial review of a claim of privilege ...
can i get you to just lower your voice ?
... that it would be inconsistent ...
jacob geery .
hey , jacob .
this is timothy astor from the chicago branch .
listen , your head of accounts
sent over a p @-@ 204 marked &quot; urgent . &quot;
the thing is , she left out today &apos;s clearance code ,
so i &apos;m not authorized to send this baby back .
uh , i can &apos;t give you the clearance code .
you &apos;ll have to talk to marjorie .
i &apos;m aware of that , jacob . i &apos;ve been trying to call her .
please -- each branch
must initially interpret the constitution ...
s @-@ she &apos;s busy at the moment .
all right . you know how it is with p @-@ 204s .
it &apos;s not my butt in the meat grinder .
i really -- i really need --
and the counsel ...
marjorie ? marjorie , i have a timothy astor --
yes ! help him with anything he needs !
... over the subpoena should hold ...
yes .
please .
that any decisions of this court , however ...
the code today is green 5 .
you nailed it , jacob . i &apos;ll send that p @-@ 204 right over .
all right . have a good one .
this is not the correct --
that it is emphatically the province and duty
of the judicial department to say what the law is ...
sorry . this isn &apos;t -- this is institu--
sir , i must have you--
... a @-@ a @-@ at 177 .
please , sir . i &apos;ll--
please , can we take this to my office ?
cameron duponte .
i lost my wallet .
... of marbury v. madison .
继任总统杰弗逊让国务卿麦迪逊将这十六份委任状扔掉
the separation of powers doctrine
precludes judicial review of a claim of privilege ...
before you ask , i don &apos;t expect any special treatment .
of course , mr. duponte .
i do have to verify some personal information
before i can reissue you a debit card .
not a problem .
... &quot; conversations that would be inconsistent
with the public interest to produce . &quot;
街道名称
uh , the first contention is a broad claim ...
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t get your name .
you &apos;re late . why ?
i am at the bank , helping sara out .
ah , domestic partnership .
hey , does she make you iron your shirts in the morning ?
mother &apos;s maiden name ?
uh , mitchell .
elizabeth has to make you iron your shirts ?
if i &apos;m wearing a jacket , you can only see the middle .
street you grew up on ?
uh , portage avenue .
who are you talking to ?
i am with the bank teller .
did you call to find out if my shirt has wrinkles ?
jones found a signature in the virus .
it belongs to the vulture .
the vulture would be a big catch .
sir , please , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you ...
my friend &apos;s an avid ornithologist .
no name yet , but we &apos;ll track it down .
how &apos;s sara holding up ?
she &apos;s making the best of a bad situation .
however ...
the counsel , as agreed --
all right , that &apos;s enough . can i see your credentials ?
no , you may certainly not .
please see him out .
oh , fat chance .
i &apos;m highly trained in hapkido .
you have restored my confidence in this organization .
carry on , gentlemen .
good day .
i &apos;ll be taking these .
what were you reading back there ?
oh , the court issuance from watergate ,
with the word &quot; president &quot; excised .
i just grabbed the first thing lying around .
all right , we &apos;re in .
all the duponte information &apos;s changed ?
everything but the balance login .
the thief can &apos;t touch the account , but he can see it .
all right .
let &apos;s give him something to look at .
when you said we were going to spend the thief out of hiding ,
i envisioned something more like supermarket sweep on fifth avenue .
no , our first purchase should send a clear message
we &apos;re willing to blow all $ 125 million .
mozzie didn &apos;t seem too pleased we were pulling a con on vulture .
he has a weakness for notorious scofflaws .
mr. and mrs. duponte . i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
the agusta westland aw139--
she &apos;s the bentley of the sky .
room for nine in a full @-@ leather interior ,
multimedia center with active noise control .
let &apos;s talk cost .
fully decked , around $ 20 million .
oh . that &apos;s ... not really what we had in mind .
we do have some more economical alternatives .
excuse me .
the problem is volume .
we &apos;ll need four .
i &apos;ll take it all .
we &apos;ll take all three .
word from the swiss bank ?
yeah . they won &apos;t budge on our request to freeze the account .
but they did report something unexpected .
duponte came into their new york branch
to have a debit card reissued .
then started spending in a big way .
two dozen fioravanti suits
and twice that in valentino dresses ,
matching black and red rolls @-@ royce convertibles .
this sounds like the world &apos;s most expensive date .
you think duponte has a partner with expensive tastes ?
i think i have a partner with expensive tastes .
what do you think ?
well , it &apos;s almost right .
there we go .
i never thought i would say this ,
but i &apos;m actually worn out from shopping .
well , you better get your second wind ,
because we still have a lot left in our coffers .
well , i suppose i can muster up some strength .
look , i have to ask you a stupid question .
what do we do if the vulture does come after us ?
hackers aren &apos;t known for their physical prowess .
that &apos;s not a strategy .
look , i @-@ if the vulture shows up ,
we call peter , and the fbi arrests him .
oh , so you were gonna call me eventually ?
peter , there is an explanation for all this .
you thought you &apos;d spend the money to draw the vulture out of hiding .
i love how we &apos;re always on the same page .
same page ? we &apos;re not reading the same book .
we &apos;re not even in the same library .
okay , i can see that you &apos;re mad .
damn right i &apos;m mad .
you robbed a bank .
vulture robbed a bank . we simply ...
robbed a different bank ? nice dress .
what were you thinking , sara ?
look , it was either that
or we sit on our hands until this guy slipped up .
i &apos;m not sitting on my hands . this is due process .
i should have known that you &apos;d come up
with some half @-@ baked idea to avoid it .
if we give it some time --
no . absolutely not . this ends now .
sara , i suggest that you change your clothes
and collect all the receipts ,
because all of this is going back
as soon as the case is closed .
you -- you &apos;re coming with me .
there &apos;s a lot of missing money out there ,
and someone &apos;s going to prison for it .
you &apos;re gonna help me make sure that it &apos;s the vulture
and not the two of you .
okay ?
maybe call and cancel the hot tub .
yeah .
i should have known there was gonna be trouble
when sara moved in .
she didn &apos;t move in .
you don &apos;t have $ 125 million at your disposal ,
yet both things apparently are true .
well , in the past , the bureau &apos;s okayed extravagant stings , right ?
that &apos;s right , honey . the bureau okays them .
there are checks and balances --
a notion that goes beyond neal &apos;s comprehension .
no , i understand checks .
it &apos;s just the balances that i struggle with .
well , we &apos;re not any closer to finding the vulture .
vulture ?
a hacker with a knack for fomenting social unrest .
but theft has never been his m.o.
no ? well , i &apos;ll ask him when we bring him in .
any idea how we can get this guy ?
no , that &apos;s mozzie &apos;s province .
i keep my heists in the third dimension .
well , i &apos;m sure he could help .
why don &apos;t i give mozzie a call ?
you have his number ?
we chat .
they chat ?
i wouldn &apos;t be too concerned .
mozzie is very good with boundaries .
i &apos;m not here to catch vulture .
he &apos;s a criminal . that &apos;s exactly why you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m here to prove his innocence .
and if you &apos;re gonna use your government trickery
for any other purpose , i withdraw my services .
calm down , moz .
peter won &apos;t arrest the vulture if he isn &apos;t guilty .
ah . moroccan mint tea .
mrs. suit just bought you an extra five minutes .
i see you boys are getting along .
like burr and hamilton .
fellow revolutionaries ?
pistols at noon .
mozzie &apos;s explaining why i should recategorize the vulture
as a civic hero .
well , maybe mozzie &apos;s right .
maybe the vulture isn &apos;t the thief .
honey . hm .
tell me who he is , and i &apos;ll hear him out .
how should i know who he is ?
look ... the entire hacker lifestyle is based on anonymity .
chances are , the vulture &apos;s best friends don &apos;t know his name .
how am i gonna catch this guy ?
mozzie , how are you gonna contact him ?
the online underground communicates via i.r.c.
internet relay chat -- i know what it is .
if you need to send a message to the vulture
on the internet superhighway ,
then this is where you hang the billboard .
well , how do we get the attention of a hacker ?
say &quot; hi &quot; from microsoft source code ?
how about the feds offer full immunity ?
no .
i can &apos;t offer full immunity without going up the ladder .
uh , you might want to go up the ladder .
you already posted it ? take it down -- now !
it can &apos;t be undone .
in fairness , we weren &apos;t making much headway without him .
we also didn &apos;t alert the vulture that we were onto him .
oh . so you don &apos;t want to meet ?
the vulture responded ?
grand army plaza , tomorrow morning .
thank me any time .
this location &apos;s too public .
there &apos;s no way to know who we &apos;re looking for .
the vulture wants to maintain a strategic advantage .
a wise move , given your propensity
for casting false accusations .
does anyone have a visual ?
there &apos;s no sign of him yet .
i &apos;m checking for smartphones and internet connections .
you know , we &apos;re not far removed
from fully sentient automobiles .
yeah , we could be experiencing
a hostile technological takeover any day now .
i &apos;m glad the fbi is taking notice .
i have some ideas for international fail @-@ safes that --
i am innocent .
see ? it knows .
no , it was reading a text message , moz .
vulture &apos;s here .
11 : 00 . is that him ?
that guy right there with the hat .
he &apos;s texting .
daddy !
how &apos;s my girls ?
i don &apos;t see him .
it &apos;s not a him .
it &apos;s a her .
she can text without looking .
send out the handsome one .
the one in the back .
consider that a lesson in modesty .
diana , vulture &apos;s a female --
green backpack , headed north .
jones , locate the shooter .
roger , sir .
get off me , you corpocratic sycophant !
she bit me .
you work for a government
who apportions more weight to lobbyists than to constituents .
who &apos;s worse ?
jones , you have anything ?
we found the roost , but our shooter is long gone .
all right , collect all the evidence
and bring it back with ballistics .
you can keep your little csi kit in your pants .
the person you &apos;re looking for is kurt brauer .
how do you know ?
because i helped him build the virus
that drained manhattan mutual .
get her out of here .
wow . no , don &apos;t .
but did you see her ?
you &apos;ve got a lot of cool toys .
they &apos;re only toys in your hands .
in my client &apos;s hands , those are wmds .
for her legal counsel , you &apos;re not helping her case .
strike that from the record .
so , why can &apos;t we find a photo of brauer ?
he &apos;s off the grid . i &apos;ve looked , too .
i can &apos;t tell you what he looks like ,
but i can tell you what i know .
as long as my client leaves uncharged and unmolested !
don &apos;t touch the wmds .
and i &apos;m not calling you vulture .
sally .
short for &quot; salieri &quot; ?
it is now .
sally , you built the virus for brauer ?
i built it with brauer .
a few months ago , he reached out to me --
wanted help scratching up a bug to infiltrate bank accounts .
then he cut you out of the robbery .
there wasn &apos;t supposed to be a robbery .
you put your hand in the cookie jar ,
but you didn &apos;t want a cookie ?
what do you see out that window ?
i see a thousand c.e.o.s collecting undisclosed bonuses .
even as they lay off half their workforce .
you wanted to publicize their bank statements .
someone in this city has to expose corruption .
doesn &apos;t sound that different
from the ideology brauer &apos;s espousing .
his paper mask manifesto ? it &apos;s a bastardization .
all buzz , no bite .
none of us in the movement were fooled .
he didn &apos;t take a shot at you over your political differences .
no . he probably thinks i &apos;m the one spending his money .
so , whoever spent the money almost got you shot ?
point of fact -- i was against the plan from the incepti--
i apologize . but the plan drew out brauer .
that should count as half a win .
i &apos;m gonna get us the other half .
we leaked security photos from your shopping spree .
oh , that way , brauer takes his next shot at me . sounds fun .
i love how we &apos;re always on the same page .
then we linked a series of remote purchases
to a p.o. box and set up a delivery date .
he assumes i &apos;m picking up my order
and shows up to take me out .
then we take him out .
and that &apos;s how the fbi does a sting .
mm . i &apos;m impressed .
but my way was more fun .
you here to collect your legal fees ?
i &apos;m here to protect you .
that &apos;s precious , but i &apos;ve been protecting myself for years .
your face is out there ,
which makes you eminently trackable .
you &apos;re an expert online , but ...
you &apos;re in my world now .
i see you &apos;ve safeguarded against sunlight .
i don &apos;t like my neighbors .
how long is this gonna take ?
well , we need to put up electrified bars over the windows ...
... reinforce the door .
what &apos;s in there ?
my bedroom .
i assume that &apos;s , uh , plenty secure .
i don &apos;t know . is it ?
of course , they &apos;re putting rfid chips in food packaging now ,
so they can track you through your cap &apos;n crunch .
we should replace your , uh , cereal boxes
with plastic container--
uh , foil ...
it &apos;s not just good for hats .
this is what heaven feels like .
the faux @-@ fur industry &apos;s certainly come a long way .
is it just me , or does knowing this les paul cost 800 grand
actually make it sound better ?
we &apos;ll have to buy you a cheaper one when this is all over .
once you go gold , you can &apos;t go back .
sure , but you have to .
it is not in the budget .
once brauer &apos;s plunder is back where it belongs .
unless we could find another way .
meaning ?
these past few days --
they remind me of the palazzo sasso .
they &apos;ve been perfect .
you &apos;re really hung up on that hotel .
it wasn &apos;t just the hotel .
it was a time in my life
when i had everything i was looking for --
freedom ...
excitement ...
comfort ...
and the right people to share it with .
you think ... this might be another one of those moments ?
what if i told you
that we could keep living like this ?
what -- rich beyond measure ,
unaccountable to anyone or anything ,
not a care in the world ?
is that a yes ?
no , it &apos;s a daydream .
well , maybe daydreams can come true .
and that is why i like you .
because you dreamed all of this up .
and it really has been a hell of a lot of fun .
but ?
but we didn &apos;t earn it , neal .
people like me don &apos;t get gold @-@ plated guitars --
not legally .
i don &apos;t cross any line i can &apos;t come back from .
and i &apos;d never ask you to .
okay .
well , maybe this is our palazzo sasso , then .
but i think you &apos;re forgetting
a very important part of that story .
the palazzo sasso didn &apos;t last .
you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s the plan if brauer doesn &apos;t show up at the p.o. box ?
you spent $ 90 million in 36 hours .
he &apos;ll show .
how are you and sara doing ?
well , you know , there are always growing pains .
she &apos;s taken over the closet ?
are you in a full @-@ fledged garment war with elizabeth ?
i mean , first she wants you to iron your own shirts ,
and now she &apos;s taking over the closet ?
we &apos;re not talking about el and me .
sara did complain about my anklet .
i toss in my sleep , and she bruises easily .
how about if i take off your anklet ?
that &apos;d be great .
then we &apos;ll see if sara prefers conjugal visits .
&apos;cause you &apos;d be in prison .
a @-@ as a rule of thumb ,
you shouldn &apos;t have to explain your jokes .
yeah .
brauer didn &apos;t come to the p.o. box .
evidently , $ 90 million
isn &apos;t as compelling as one might think .
he did send a delivery service .
a delivery service ?
what was the delivery ?
a flash drive .
to the bourgeois swine responsible
for squandering the capital with which our freedom was to be purchased --
more b.s. political rhetoric .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
last time , he put a .40 @-@ caliber round
an inch from vulture &apos;s head .
and now he &apos;s leveling idle threats .
what &apos;s he up to ?
guys , we got a problem .
what is it ?
brauer got behind the firewall .
get everybody offline now .
everybody ! network cables out now !
unplug your computers ! unplug them !
i need a full system reboot .
what the hell happened ?
i thought cyber crimes scanned that drive .
they did . they did . this is something new .
a virus hidden between lines of code on the video file ?
if brauer got in our network ,
who knows what he has .
we &apos;re back up .
good .
this machine was inactive when we got hacked .
so it should be clean .
he went straight for the duponte account ,
but he just got the personal information caffrey changed .
he &apos;s restoring the identity you stole from him .
well , he &apos;d have to go into the bank to access the money .
after that , i &apos;m betting he splits town
as fast as possible .
if brauer was at the bank ,
he &apos;d be on their security footage .
the swiss still won &apos;t play ball .
without brauer &apos;s photo , we &apos;re not catching him .
technically , we don &apos;t need permission
to pull the security tapes .
don &apos;t we have a new friend who hacks into banks ?
uh , hello ?
moz ?
neal , this isn &apos;t a great time .
yeah , well , you &apos;ve got the fbi on the line .
we need to talk to your new client .
please call my office during normal business hours
to set an appointment .
can you find sally or not ?
hang on .
do you see my glasses ?
they &apos;re right in front of you .
wait .
are they ...
i think ... they are .
are these your socks ?
that one is mine .
i will never unhear that .
okay , she &apos;s here now .
yeah , we got that .
we think brauer has recaptured the duponte account .
he &apos;s got to be on surveillance , but the bank is stonewalling .
for obvious reasons , the fbi can &apos;t violate their security .
but if someone else did ...
ah , way ahead of you .
we &apos;ll send over the footage as soon as we have it .
bye .
me too .
we got video .
it &apos;s cued up to just before the account was reinstated .
that &apos;s got to be brauer .
stop there .
back him up to the door .
blow it up on his face .
all right , logan , get that picture to nypd .
tell them to put out an all @-@ points .
all right , let &apos;s get to the end .
i want to see what he did when he left .
do we have the exterior camera ?
freeze it . right there .
can we bring it closer ?
i know where that cab dropped him off .
spread out .
i need an agent on every jetty , car park , and subway terminal .
let &apos;s get into position ! red team !
blue team &apos;s with me .
diana , get someone in the cctv room .
let terminal security know we &apos;re here .
got it .
i told hughes we need more agents .
this is one of the biggest ports in the eastern seaboard .
we could definitely use more manpower . this is ...
neal ?
yeah ?
get sally back on the line .
what are you thinking ?
mozzie , it &apos;s agent burke .
i need your help .
we &apos;re gonna deputize every single person in this terminal .
i own the cell towers .
how are you on the video monitors ?
fits and starts . the hsm box is giving me trouble .
it &apos;s the cellcom unit .
you should try running a router mask .
a router mask !
you think they can pull it off ?
well , you picked the right two misfits to try .
and there &apos;s your answer .
that was fast .
21st century &apos;s a house of cards , peter .
now the fun part .
that &apos;s the guy ! that -- that &apos;s him !
we got him !
t @-@ that &apos;s him ! that &apos;s him !
brauer ! freeze !
man , he looks familiar .
have i seen your picture somewhere ?
yeah , you &apos;re somebody . isn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he &apos;s definitely somebody .
this won &apos;t stick .
i &apos;m a hero . you &apos;re a thief .
not underground . not to my people .
i &apos;ve actually spent a lot of time with your people .
more than he &apos;d like .
you robbed a bank , and you tried to kill vulture .
you don &apos;t have any friends left , above or below ground .
and i bet this has everything we need
to prove you built the virus .
just don &apos;t plug it in at the office .
big brother here . we &apos;re always watching .
we got him .
excellent .
tell sally thanks .
tell the suit he can thank me
with department of justice access codes .
not gonna happen .
we &apos;ll settle for department of agriculture .
you know how hormone @-@ injected chickens are --
thanks , moz .
another &quot; w &quot; for caffrey and burke .
complete with late @-@ inning heroics --
just the way i like it .
what , you don &apos;t appreciate a nice , relaxing blowout ?
oh , i &apos;ll take a win however i can get it .
there is something about the bottom of the ninth .
yeah , bases loaded , full count , two outs .
and we knock it out of the park .
plus , you always make sure my job is a challenge .
ah , come on .
i sent some probies to your apartment
to collect your millionaire fantasy camp .
there &apos;ll be a lot of happy people
to know they &apos;re getting their money back .
yeah , and a lot of unhappy store clerks
when you return everything we bought with brauer &apos;s score .
you worried about that
or the fact that you have to give it up ?
can it be both ?
nope . you knew you couldn &apos;t keep those things forever .
do you remember when i was staying
at the palazzo sasso in ravello
and you had europol closing in ?
no . you were in ravello ?
right after the corsica heist .
i had no idea you were there .
i had europol leak that we were getting close
so you &apos;d keep moving .
you were bluffing .
yeah .
so i could have stayed there .
yeah . i guess you could have .
that &apos;s the last of it . thank you , guys -- very much .
no problem , ma &apos;am .
you get the door ?
yeah .
sara ?
i see you &apos;ve found mozzie &apos;s bug scanner .
sorry , june . i didn &apos;t know you were home .
i @-@ i don &apos;t like those federal agents around the house
without supervision .
sure .
you and mozzie don &apos;t care much for authority .
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s an acquired distaste .
well , this place is incredible . it &apos;s like franklin castle .
who built it ?
my late husband , byron .
the police arrested him
when they found some fake casino chips under the cushion .
but after he came back from prison ...
probably still had a lot of secrets --
just hid them better ?
we &apos;re not talking about byron anymore , are we ?
no .
give neal time , and he &apos;ll let you in .
and in the meantime ?
i saved byron &apos;s hide on many occasions .
i knew more than he thought i did .
thank you .
talk later .
yes , ma &apos;am .
bye .
bye .
we got brauer .
i heard . it &apos;s pretty amazing .
when will you be home ?
are we a &quot; when will you be home &quot; couple ?
no . i ...
i &apos;m asking
because when you said that we could keep living like this ,
what did you mean , neal ?
nothing .
you know , it &apos;s like you said -- i was ... daydreaming .
really ? that &apos;s all ?
that &apos;s really all .
come on . smile .
you &apos;re gonna get your money back .
we &apos;ll celebrate tonight .
okay .
what you got there ?
oh . vulture &apos;s number .
and i didn &apos;t even have to circumvent a middlebox .
you got yourself a girlfriend .
neither i nor she would ever thrust
such a crude epithet upon ourselves .
you thinking about staying ?
in new york ?
yeah .
you &apos;re thinking about staying .
it &apos;s crossed my mind .
no , no . i @-@ i don &apos;t want to hear this .
nobody knows we have the treasure , moz .
we can live our lives .
as closet billionaires ?
i don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s not how this works .
the secret of the treasure is radioactive .
a look here , a whisper there .
it &apos;s ... too big .
it can &apos;t be kept .
what are you doing ?
cutting all ties .
our future is lying in a vault right now ,
waiting for us .
this is no time to be dropping anchor .
no complications .
no complications .
don &apos;t you have perfect recall ?
symbolic gesture .
