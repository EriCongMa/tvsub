remember before when we don &apos;t have kids ,
we can just lie in bed on saturday .
that &apos;s how we got them .
why did i have to be so sexy ?
a few months ago , luke joined the club soccer team .
and at first , we were thrilled .
but then we realized
it takes over your whole weekend .
and not in the cool marathon way .
luke sits on the bench a lot ,
which means we sit in the hot sun for like eight hours
just to see him play five minutes .
but what a five minutes . tell &apos;em about last week .
oh , yeah . luke stopped a goal with his face .
too bad he doesn &apos;t remember that .
yeah .
what if we sent luke to the game without us today ?
we can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
missing one tournament doesn &apos;t
make us bad parents .
my mom never went to any of my stuff .
i &apos;m fine .
why didn &apos;t she go to any of your stuff ?
because she was an incredibly competitive woman
who didn &apos;t like to see me do very well at anything ,
but i think it &apos;s pretty clear who won .
i &apos;m working now , you know ,
and i really need my weekends back
to -- to catch up on errands .
i don &apos;t know . it just feels wrong .
would it feel wrong to use that robot gutter cleaner
that &apos;s been sitting in the box for the last three weeks ?
no , that would feel right -- so right .
did i tell you i call it &quot; the gutter done &quot; ?
you did ! i love &quot; gutter done . &quot;
it &apos;s your sense of humor . it &apos;s so fun .
okay , stop drilling . you struck oil .
but only if luke &apos;s 100 % cool with it .
yeah , of course . i &apos;m on it .
you know , if we &apos;re not going ,
we could stay in bed a little longer .
no , thank you .
okay .
don &apos;t want to have this conversation again in 15 years .
what are you doing with those swatches ?
she &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
i told you to put all this wedding stuff away .
are these really our top @-@ two choices for color palette ?
why are they both white ?
that &apos;s what my friend keisha asks about you and daddy .
instead of hiding all this stuff ,
why don &apos;t you just tell pam we &apos;re getting married ?
i will , when she &apos;s ready .
carefully and preferably in a large , open field .
she &apos;s your sister , not the hulk .
my big sister , pam , is emotionally fragile
and she &apos;s still single , so when she finds out
i &apos;m getting married before she is --
look out .
she can be meaner than a barn owl at sunset .
because that &apos;s when they wake up ?
yep . that &apos;s morning time for a barn owl .
it &apos;s her !
quick ! hide !
it &apos;s okay , lily . come on .
oh , take that bow out of her hair .
i don &apos;t want to rub our daughter &apos;s adorableness
in my barren sister &apos;s face .
there she is !
hey , pam !
well , the damn airline lost my trunk .
now i &apos;m gonna have to make new clothes .
oh , no .
yep .
i need to squeeze something .
get over here , lily .
i &apos;m good .
yeah , well , she &apos;s shy .
so , pam , we &apos;ve got some big news .
speaking of big news --
you remember that little ugly girl i used to babysit ,
britney horner ?
yeah .
well , she got married last summer ,
and now she &apos;s pregnant with twins .
so , if you &apos;re keeping track , that &apos;s ugly -- 2 , me -- nothing .
what &apos;s your news ?
well ...
we &apos;re getting a new dryer .
well , i &apos;m very happy for y &apos;all .
thank you .
how come i never get a new dryer ?
mom , in all the time you &apos;ve known grandpa ,
has he ever used the word &quot; fluxions &quot; ?
that is not an f @-@ word i have heard him use .
he &apos;s beating me in &quot; words with friends . &quot;
how is that even possible ?
shouldn &apos;t you be playing &quot; words with friends &quot;
with friends ?
grandpa is my friend .
of course he is . that &apos;s not sad . what ?
morning , buddy . what &apos;s with the pillow ?
it &apos;s for soccer .
my neck gets pretty tired watching all those games .
right .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet .
say , listen , your dad and i were just talking
about you maybe wanting to go to the game without us today .
but it &apos;s totally up to you .
whatever you want because we love you very much .
right . you can either ride with some of your teammates ,
like the l.a. kings ,
or you can ride with us ,
like how gloria and grandpa take joe to playdates .
professional athlete , little poopy baby --
your call .
i &apos;ll get a ride with max .
great !
are you sure it &apos;s okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
hey , can i borrow your sleep mask ?
you bet .
awesome .
yes ! i love that kid .
can you imagine how easy it would be
if it was just him ?
i mean ...
i know what you mean .
you call that folded ?
where &apos;s that military precision ?
we didn &apos;t fold many onesies in the navy .
i &apos;m back !
what did the doctor say ?
he said my eyes are perfect .
where was he looking when he said it ?
pretty sure gloria needs glasses .
the last couple of months , she &apos;s been struggling .
i &apos;ll take this one . it looks very good .
that &apos;s their address , magoo .
did he even give you an eye test ?
he put the spoon in one eye ,
the spoon in the other eye ,
the puff puff , the eye drops .
20 / 20 . now who &apos;s the magoo ?
what the hell language was that ?
did you see that fresh coat of nail polish ?
she never went to the doctor .
why would she lie ?
she &apos;s vain , manny .
she doesn &apos;t want to wear glasses .
well , she &apos;s only hurting herself .
okay , i hope you &apos;re hungry .
starving .
that damn airline ran out of roast beef .
tried to fast talk me
into eating something called &quot; hoo @-@ mus . &quot;
oh , hummus -- it &apos;s actually really delicious .
you would like tha-- uh . oh .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , uh , that &apos;s an action figure .
it &apos;s two grooms .
they melted together in the car
on a very , very hot day .
it was 103 .
my daddies are getting married .
your dads are getting married ?
that can &apos;t be right .
that &apos;s what my friend keisha says .
is this true ?
pam , honest to goodness , we were gonna tell you .
get over here , you !
she &apos;s got me .
well , damn !
this is the greatest news i &apos;ve ever heard !
oh , i am so happy to hear you say that , pam .
of course . oh !
i want my baby brother to be happy .
and as long as we &apos;re sharing , i have some news .
you remember bo johnson ?
oh , my gosh , how could i forget ? oh !
he was my first crush .
please tell me nothing happened to his face .
what did he fall into ?
he fell into me .
we &apos;re engaged !
say what ?
bo and i are getting married !
that is fantastic ! cam , isn &apos;t this great news ?
come here , you . oh !
yeah . so great .
get in on this ! come on !
thank you for jumping .
i didn &apos;t feel guilty for missing luke &apos;s soccer tournament
because i had a ton of errands
i figured would take me all day to finish .
but for some weird reason , i was flying through my list .
i ended up in every short line .
i made every green light .
it was the ultimate karmic bitch @-@ slap .
because suddenly i had no more errands ,
which meant no more excuses ,
which meant me at that boring soccer tournament .
hi . there you are .
your son is playing so great .
no , i &apos;m luke &apos;s mom .
no , i know .
he &apos;s been amazing all day .
luke ?
oh ! luke ?
here , you want one ?
uh , no , thanks . i &apos;m coffeed out .
oh , honey , it &apos;s sangria .
well , all right .
okay , that &apos;s it . grandpa &apos;s cheating .
on gloria ?
how could he possibly do better ?
no , not on gloria -- on this game .
i &apos;ve never lost it to anyone .
keep playing word games with grandpa ,
and you never will .
hey , girls !
hey . what is that thing ?
what do they call it ,
or what should they have called it ?
never mind .
uh , wait , wait , wait !
it &apos;s a gutter cleaner .
ladies , i give you the future .
how many times have you girls seen me fall off this ladder ?
now that &apos;s gonna happen less .
looks like your , uh ,
gutter cleaner is stuck on something .
not a problem .
this baby detects blockage and then ramps up the power .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve nicknamed it &quot; the gutter done . &quot;
dad !
stop !
sorry , it &apos;s such a missed opportunity .
aah ! oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god !
what ? what happened ?
it &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest !
no !
and they &apos;re all dead !
oh , my god !
you killed them !
honey , it wasn &apos;t me !
it was the robot !
look at it .
it doesn &apos;t know !
i &apos;m sorry !
mom ! mom ! help !
what ? ! what happened ? !
i just ate a handful of this rat poison .
why ? !
i thought it was trail mix .
why do i keep it so close together ?
i &apos;ll call 911 !
here , read the box !
tell me what it says to do !
hurry !
it says ...
i don &apos;t have much time !
in the ...
and i &apos;m dead .
what ?
you &apos;d rather kill your husband
than admit you need glasses .
wow , mom .
it &apos;s not poison ?
oh , there &apos;s rat poison ,
and i do keep it dangerously close to the trail mix ,
but this was to point out
that your vanity could be fatal .
i knew this was all a trick .
that &apos;s why i acted like i couldn &apos;t read that box !
how many people have to pretend to die , gloria ?
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
pam and bo johnson ?
my bo johnson ?
&quot; my &quot; ?
should it bother me that you &apos;re this jealous of an old crush ?
oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
bo is straight .
he &apos;d probably never go for me .
oh , my gosh , it is bo !
look , he &apos;s hotter than ever .
i &apos;m gonna answer it .
no , you can &apos;t .
yes , i can . we &apos;re practically family .
hey , dude . it &apos;s cam .
where ?
been good -- been real , real good .
so , you and pam , huh ?
hey , better be good to my old sis ,
or i &apos;ll have to wrestle you down .
oh , my god . - hey , question --
do you still have that friendship bracelet that i made for you ?
oh , okay .
yeah , okay , if you &apos;re busy , i &apos;ll have pam call you back .
hey , and , bo , congratulations .
you too .
can you believe it ?
oh , and we &apos;re gay again .
it just doesn &apos;t make sense .
i mean , he &apos;s got to be after our drilling rights .
i knew it .
this is why i didn &apos;t want to tell you .
i knew you couldn &apos;t stand the thought
of me landing the man of your dreams !
&quot; dreams &quot; is strong .
believe it or not , bo and i are in love .
he thinks i &apos;m beautiful , and he &apos;s right .
and for the record , bo has twice the land we do .
he has absolutely no interest in my drilling rights !
not that kind , at least .
okay , let &apos;s just relax .
hey , hey , come on , pam , do you want to pick me up again ?
they warned me , you know .
who warned you ?
the whole family said you wouldn &apos;t take it well .
ever since you moved to the city
&apos;cause you couldn &apos;t hack it on the farm .
&quot; couldn &apos;t hack it &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
everyone knows , cam , you &apos;re not farm strong .
you take that back , pameron jessica tucker !
i will not ! you are weak and weepy .
that &apos;s why we can &apos;t ever say anything to you
&apos;cause we know you &apos;ll crumble into a big heaping mess !
oh , are you saying i &apos;m the one people have to step around --
that i &apos;m the pam of the family ?
you mean the cam of the family ? !
&apos;cause that &apos;s what we all call it !
okay , that &apos;s enough !
that &apos;s enough ! that &apos;s enough !
you know what ? well , i was gammy &apos;s favorite !
that &apos;s enough !
really ?
yeah !
come on ! enough !
no !
seriously -- pameron ?
oh ! way to go , luke !
the kid &apos;s amazing .
amazing .
so great .
right ? hello ?
claire ?
phil ?
oh , hi , honey , i was -- i was just about to call you .
i killed a bunch of baby birds .
what ?
my robot wiped out the nest .
and now the mom &apos;s just staring at me .
they recognize faces , you know .
i saw it in a documentary .
sweetie , i &apos;m sure it was just an accident .
none of this would have happened
if we &apos;d just gone to luke &apos;s game .
we &apos;re terrible parents for not going .
no . no .
was that a whistle ? where are you ?
um , i @-@ i &apos;m just walking by a construction site .
pervs !
sorry . sorry . not you .
i hope luke &apos;s not mad at us .
no , he &apos;s fine , honey .
or he &apos;s not . he -- he could be mad .
we don &apos;t know . we won &apos;t -- we won &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be home soon , though .
i love you . okay , bye @-@ bye .
thank you . it was great .
hey , luke , luke , luke ,
don &apos;t tell your dad i was here , all right ? great game .
claire ?
claire ?
say good night to daddy .
mwah ! good night , my boy .
hey , grandpa , great word you played earlier today .
what does &quot; syzygy &quot; even mean ?
it means 45 points . ha !
hey , everybody , you remember my sister , pam .
oh , hi , pam .
she &apos;s here to pay a visit and cast aspersions .
oh , grow up .
you grow up .
real good one .
hi , y &apos;all . i brought boar .
oh . well , let me give you a hand with that .
cam , look , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but please just try and let it go tonight .
well , can you believe she said i &apos;m the emotionally fragile one ?
i mean , how crazy is that ?
boy .
&quot; boy &quot; ?
is that your thinly veiled
way of saying you agree with her ?
okay , you know what ?
if i was fragile , i would care ,
but i &apos;m not , so i don &apos;t .
good .
good .
and you know what ? that shirt washes you out ,
so don &apos;t be shocked when someone mistakes you for a beige candle .
hey , everyone .
hi , luke .
hey , buddy .
i &apos;m so sorry i missed your game .
we are both so sorry we missed your game .
the universe punished me .
i did something awful to a bunch of baby crows .
actually , it &apos;s not a bunch of crows .
it &apos;s called a murder .
i know what i did !
how was your game ?
fine . nothing special .
what do you mean , &quot; fine , nothing special &quot; ?
well , there was this girl on the 16 @-@ year @-@ old team
who wasn &apos;t wearing a bra .
so that was cool .
but josh &apos;s mom texted me .
she said you were having a great game .
she drinks .
i @-@ i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , phil .
hey , pam .
oh . sorry .
it &apos;s my parents again .
i &apos;m getting married soon ,
and they &apos;re already acting like they have empty nest syndrome .
i appreciate you not saying
anything to your dad about me being there ,
but why aren &apos;t you telling him what a great game you played ?
i can tell he feels bad enough for missing it .
i don &apos;t want to make him feel worse .
i screwed up .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i talked phil into skipping luke &apos;s game ,
and then i went , and , of course , he played the game of his life .
but luke doesn &apos;t want to
tell phil about the game now
because he doesn &apos;t want to hurt his feelings .
oh , well , i think it &apos;s sweet that luke &apos;s protecting phil .
you know , we all have to protect my sister in my family
because she &apos;s a disaster .
i mean , you can see it , right ?
i think it was a little weird she brought pig to a party .
hey ! i can say it .
hey , hon .
i &apos;m sorry about what i did before .
i saw this , and i thought it would look beautiful on you .
you know i can &apos;t stay mad at you
when you buy me ...
glasses , you son of a bitch !
just try &apos; em on . you &apos;ll still look gorgeous .
i will try them on when you buy hearing aids !
there &apos;s nothing wrong with my hearing .
um , i have a , uh , hearing @-@ test app on my phone .
let &apos;s do it !
you do it !
okay .
everybody under the age of 60 should be able to hear this .
yes . heard that .
yeah , definitely .
what ? you &apos;re lying . you didn &apos;t hear anything .
we did ! you see , you &apos;re deaf !
okay , 70 .
mm @-@ hmm . yes .
oh , what is th-- did she put you up to this ?
here , grandpa , i &apos;ll play you something even louder .
okay , i heard that one .
i didn &apos;t press anything .
oh , look who &apos;s a cheater .
don &apos;t worry about it , big guy .
i have trouble smelling lemons .
you know , i don &apos;t need any of this .
but i &apos;ll tell you what i can hear loud and clear .
the sound of you all munching free food .
oh , come on , dad ,
aren &apos;t you being a little oversensitive ?
oh , well , we can consult my sister , pam .
she &apos;s the self @-@ appointed sensitivity expert .
oh , let it go .
i will not let it go .
in fact , i would like
everyone to be honest with me , please , right now .
no sugar @-@ coating .
my sister here seems to think you all
have to walk on eggshells around me .
eggshells .
do you all think i &apos;m so fragile
you can &apos;t tell me things
for fear of how i will react ?
well .
claire , don &apos;t . zip . bup @-@ bup @-@ bup .
no , let her talk , please .
claire , you have the floor .
w @-@ well , you &apos;re not not fragile .
okay , well , why don &apos;t you give me an example
of something you haven &apos;t told me
because you were worried i couldn &apos;t handle it ?
go on .
all right .
last week when we were supposed to have lunch
and you canceled ...
beyonce was at the restaurant .
okay . the singer or pepper &apos;s dog ?
the singer .
and when i was leaving ,
i @-@ i @-@ i stopped and i said hello to her
and we chatted for like 10 minutes .
okay , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m glad you had that experience ?
i mean , i don &apos;t know what you talked to her about ,
seeing that you don &apos;t know any of her songs
other than &quot; single ladies , &quot;
which everyone knows .
i love that song .
i &apos;m surprised you can hear it .
well , this was fun . who &apos;s hungry ?
hey , where &apos;s that boar ?
okay , anyone else ?
well , since we &apos;re coming clean ,
you overuse the word &quot; divine . &quot;
it &apos;s just an ice @-@ cream sandwich .
you &apos;re the boy who cried &quot; divine . &quot;
okay . was not aware of that .
duly noted .
hey , i got one .
remember that blue rotary phone you gave me for christmas ?
yes .
i tossed it .
okay . may i ask the reason ?
it made me feel like
ann @-@ margret in &quot; bye @-@ bye birdie . &quot;
why ? !
okay , anyone else ?
i don &apos;t really like the
shirts with the crazy cuffs .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
can you push your boobs down ?
because i couldn &apos;t hear you .
here we go .
no , no , here we don &apos;t go .
this is fine . i &apos;m fine , okay ?
sometimes when you read to me ,
i pretend to fall asleep so you &apos;ll go .
i heard that one .
well , i heard you all loud and clear .
i have to use the restroom .
so , cam , you &apos;re sensitive .
big deal . it &apos;s one of your best qualities .
thank you , phil ,
and i &apos;m sorry your beyonce @-@ loving wife
went to luke &apos;s game without you .
see ? farm strong !
you went to luke &apos;s game ?
i did , phil , and i am so sorry .
i did not mean to .
but then he started playing the most amazing game ,
and i got so wrapped up in it .
i know i should have called .
yeah , you should &apos;ve called .
you were amazing ?
oh , he was incredible . i wish you &apos;d been there .
then why &apos;d you make me skip it ? !
i knew you had it in you !
oh , coach said he &apos;s gonna start next week .
you &apos;re starting ? i &apos;m so mad at you !
i &apos;m so proud of you !
hey , how are you doing in here ?
fine .
i &apos;m a little embarrassed about my outburst ,
but otherwise ...
you had a lot to take in .
as a lawyer , i should &apos;ve told you ,
never ask questions you don &apos;t want the answer to .
am i really that much of a mess ?
are you not listening to me ?
hey . room in here for me ?
not really .
look , i &apos;m real sorry i said what i said .
no , no , you &apos;re right .
i am the cam of the family .
apparently , i &apos;m the cam of two families , so ...
so what if you go a little cuckoo
when you get bad news ?
you also go all cuckoo when you hear good news .
it &apos;s one of the things i love most about you .
no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s true .
you &apos;re the -- you &apos;re the first person i call
when i have good news .
i mean , remember when i got my adult braces removed ?
your teeth look divi-- divine .
see ? i can &apos;t help it . i &apos;m a celebrator .
of course you are .
and i should have celebrated how lucky bo is
to land a great gal like you .
look at me . i &apos;m crying like a cam .
sorry , old habits .
are you mad because i embarrassed you ?
forget about it .
and i &apos;m gonna ease up on the glasses , too .
it &apos;s just that i worry , you know ,
you &apos;re not seeing everything .
i &apos;m getting old , jay .
when manny was little ,
i used to run around with him all day
without getting tired .
today at joe &apos;s baby class ,
a 6 @-@ year @-@ old had to pull me out of the ball pit .
hold on . manny used to run around ?
all the mothers are so young and perky .
i hate being the oldest one there .
well , i for one love that you &apos;re getting older .
it makes me feel closer to you .
so you &apos;ll like it if i get all wrinkly and saggy ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t make it a goal .
okay , i &apos;ll wear them .
what ?
nothing .
you have lines there .
i can see them very clearly now with these --
okay , okay , these are just for reading .
i won &apos;t be able to hear her .
she won &apos;t be able to see me .
we &apos;ll be together forever .
congratulations .
you officially beat me in &quot; words with friends . &quot;
better luck next time , kid .
okay , i have to ask -- did you cheat ?
is that how you won ?
i never took you for a sore loser .
that &apos;s not an answer .
listen , one day you might be the smartest person in this family ,
but today is not that day .
so tread lightly before you assiduously malign
the veracity of my etymological prowess .
jay pritchett out .
you broke your phone , smarty @-@ pants .
