i now pronounce you husband and wife .
did you tell yvonne to leave her phone at lunch ?
yes .
you wanted me to find something .
the night charlotte came home , the night she was murdered .
someone used the landline from the two crows
to call this house .
i will go to my boss , and i &apos;ll tell her the truth .
you can &apos;t do that . she &apos;ll kick you to the curb .
melissa &apos;s suitcase is broken .
the pull @-@ up handle is missing a rod .
it could &apos;ve been used as a weapon .
jordan , sorry i haven &apos;t called you back .
i think i picked a date .
the phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office .
it &apos;s about her daughter .
yvonne ?
she got rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
i leaked it .
gather your things and leave here .
go in there and tell my mother the truth .
if there needs to be a scapegoat , let it be me .
they may have found the weapon .
what ?
and they were willing to kill me to get it back .
did sara harvey come after you ?
it wasn &apos;t her . sara harvey wants this murder solved .
whoever this was , they wanna cover it up .
you want me to marry you to each other ?
it &apos;s just so weird .
i mean , i barely know the guy &apos;s first name
and now he &apos;s married to ali ?
right , well , i &apos;m sure he seems like a stranger to us
but alison and elliott have known each other for years .
hey , they just started going out .
i mean , what is this , her second date ?
whatever happened to dinner and a movie ?
um , han , there &apos;s lipstick on that fork .
i &apos;m sure it seems strange
but if you saw alison and elliott
it was ... it was pretty romantic .
i don &apos;t think romance has anything to do with it .
ali &apos;s lost everyone she &apos;s ever cared about .
she &apos;s desperate for a family .
maybe she &apos;s smart .
if you elope , no one can throw you a bridal shower .
since when do you not like bridal showers ?
gifts , expensive lingerie , cake ?
like , made for you .
not when we have two monsters after us .
spencer &apos;s not answering .
yeah , well , she &apos;s probably still dealing
with the fallout from the yvonne leak .
there &apos;s no way spencer &apos;s parents will believe caleb did that .
yeah , well , be glad that they do because if they thought
that we had a new a , they would march
straight down to the police station .
you guys , our stalker already warned us .
okay ? if we talk to the cops
we &apos;re gonna have targets on our backs .
we already do .
melissa tried to turn me into road kill last night .
no , she is not the one sending texts
and going after yvonne .
spencer could just tell toby .
i mean , he could quietly go--
no , if we talk to toby , there &apos;s nothing quiet about that .
the whole rosewood police force will be on a manhunt .
okay , can we just talk about something nice for a second ?
i want my cake back .
check out the pictures from the wedding .
your parents look so happy .
great job on the dress , han .
that &apos;s weird . i &apos;m in this picture .
i wonder who took this one .
what is that ?
wait , there &apos;s more .
oh , my god .
obviously , gil diffused the situation
and your mother &apos;s apologized to yvonne and her family .
and she ..
could you please turn that off while i &apos;m talking ?
sorry .
thank you .
several members of the press have caught wind of the fact
that the &quot; social media consultant &quot;
that was responsible for all the leaks
is your boyfriend .
i think it would be wise to put out a statement
you know , distancing yourself from him .
what ? why ?
this morning , toby spoke with the media .
issued a personal statement .
he did ?
yeah .
naturally voicing his support for his girlfriend
and taking a swipe at our &quot; nasty political tactics . &quot;
does he know that it was caleb who did it ?
why are you so protective of caleb ?
i mean , come on , spence .
don &apos;t we all have a better idea of who he really is now ?
i @-@ i have to go to the campaign office .
um , dad , would you please tell melissa to call me ?
she hasn &apos;t been answering her phone .
she left for london .
her office needed her back .
what ?
wait , why would she leave right before the election ?
why don &apos;t you stop worrying about melissa
and start focusing your attention on helping your mom ?
also might wanna think about what you &apos;re gonna say to toby .
is this too risque for the party ?
you know what , honestly , maybe we should just cancel the party .
you know , reschedule it for another time .
what ?
look , your hotel has that big thing for election night and--
the party is tomorrow .
we can &apos;t cancel .
you have friends coming in from new york--
and i have friends who have already left .
ali can &apos;t come . she had to go out of town .
it &apos;s a long story .
okay , well , maybe now you can invite mona instead .
honey , it &apos;s the first time in years
that you and your friends have all been in the same place .
yeah , because of a murder investigation .
you need this .
all of you do .
it will be a good distraction .
how was your parents &apos; wedding ?
um , good .
good . small .
did you want something to eat ?
oh , no , i can &apos;t stay long .
i &apos;m going to lunch with liam .
oh , that &apos;s right . yeah .
he seems , he seems bright .
he is .
he &apos;s very bright .
look , um , i @-@ i came here because i needed to know
what you wanted me to do .
about the @-@ the book .
how do you want me to handle it ?
so i might have already handled it .
i spoke to jillian this morning
&apos;cause i wanted to give you credit
and make sure that you didn &apos;t lose your job over this
and i sort of ended up ...
... pitching you as co @-@ writer .
what ?
well , i mean , she @-@ she loved the female voice that you gave ,
and i suggested that we ..
... write the book together .
sort of a @-@ a man and woman in dialogue .
i &apos;m so sorry , i probably should &apos;ve talked to you about this first .
no , don &apos;t be .
i @-@ i am so , so flattered .
but ... no , jillian &apos;s never gonna go for that .
i &apos;m an assistant over there .
aria , jillian seems open to this .
so ... are you ?
wait , how did this happen ?
more like , how did we not see this coming ?
melissa &apos;s done this so many times before
she probably has some special fugitive rate from the airlines .
okay , so the only way we &apos;ll be able
to confront her is on video chat ?
doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll just have to prove
she did it without her actually being here .
oh , and by the way , your mom called
about the bar menu for the shower .
what &apos;s a &quot; pink drink &quot; ?
oh , god .
is she talking about some kind of ...
em ?
em , are you there ?
i &apos;ve heard that sound before .
alright , i will place a rush order
and hopefully , the stock we have will last ...
... until we can ..
i @-@ i &apos;ll stay in a broom closet .
i &apos;m sorry , ben , can you , uh excuse me a second ?
i need a place to say .
caleb ?
is everything okay ?
uh , yeah , i just , uh
i &apos;m just trying to get a room for tonight .
i thought you were staying with the hastings .
yeah , i was .
when i was working on the campaign .
uh , which i no longer am .
what happened ?
alright , i &apos;ll tell you what , why don &apos;t i make some calls
to some other hotels and maybe--
no , no , thank you .
i already tried actually .
this was sort of my last stop .
thanks .
caleb !
you know , if you can &apos;t find any place else to stay
you can always stay in the guest room .
you know it well .
there &apos;s probably still one of your old beanies
you know , stuffed in the dresser .
i actually , i left it for you
in case you ever wanted to clean your chimney flue or something .
i really appreciate the offer , but , um ..
... i &apos;ll figure it out .
oh , hey .
hey . oh , congratulations on the book .
aria told us you may be ..
annoying , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s made even worse with zero sleep
and a writing deadline .
have @-@ have you heard that noise before ?
whistle @-@ tips .
sorry ?
it &apos;s a piece that goes in the exhaust pipe of a car
makes that high @-@ pitched whining sound .
so you &apos;re saying that noise is on purpose ?
yeah , i think it &apos;s a sad desperate plea for attention
but i don &apos;t know , maybe i &apos;m cranky from lack of sleep .
melissa , please , just call me
the second your plane lands , okay ?
i really need ..
i really need to talk to you .
bye .
i &apos;m coming .
toby ..
where is he ?
caleb isn &apos;t here , okay ?
and i know that you &apos;re upset--
he knows her .
she &apos;s not some faceless , nameless ..
she &apos;s not even a candidate , okay ?
she didn &apos;t choose to put her life under a microscope .
i know . but there &apos;s just so much about this that you don &apos;t know .
when the phillips campaign manager told me
it was caleb that did this
i told him he @-@ he must &apos;ve had his wires crossed .
i said that there &apos;s no way .
i told him , &quot; i know this guy .
and i would bet my life that he would never
do something like this . &quot;
i &apos;m glad he didn &apos;t take that bet .
hey , toby .
toby , hey , just let him explain , okay ?
there &apos;s nothing to explain .
she thought you were a friend .
i thought you were a friend .
i &apos;m sorry she &apos;s hurting .
caleb , just tell him .
so you &apos;re not even gonna deny it was you .
no . i can &apos;t .
i wanna hear it from you !
i want to hear it from your mouth why you did this .
toby , stop , okay ? caleb , tell him !
i did what i had to do .
oh , my god !
i called the auto shop , but no one answered
so i &apos;m gonna go over there .
and do what , pretend like you &apos;re gonna trick out your sedan ?
it &apos;s not funny , hanna .
once i can prove that melissa borrowed that suv
i &apos;m telling the police .
you saw that message from this morning .
we &apos;re running out of time .
hanna ?
can you help me turn on the air ?
earlier , i tried to use the oven
and beyonce started playing .
i told you , it &apos;s all linked up .
it &apos;s like a smart loft .
yeah , well , smart loft , dumb hostess .
i need two buttons , on and off .
so i ran into caleb today .
at the hotel . he said he lost his job .
do you know what happened ?
not exactly .
well , i hope you don &apos;t mind
but i offered him the guest room .
every place in town is booked .
wait . what ?
mom , i @-@ i do mind .
you &apos;re gonna let him stay in our house ?
my house , and it seemed like
he didn &apos;t have any place else to go .
he &apos;s an adult , not a pound puppy .
hanna !
this is someone you cared about .
he was a big part of your life .
just admit it .
you like caleb more than you like jordan .
what ?
you &apos;ve never given jordan a real chance .
you &apos;ve compared every guy i &apos;ve ever dated to caleb--
that &apos;s crazy .
i think jordan is great .
i just don &apos;t know him as well as i know caleb .
yeah , well , how could you ?
you don &apos;t try to spend time with him .
i have invited you both back here on multiple occasions .
you know , forget it . i don &apos;t wanna talk about this .
hey , han ? um , i &apos;ll see you later , okay ?
yeah .
hold still .
do you want me to do this or not ?
not . i keep saying &quot; not , &quot;
and you keep ignoring me .
hold still .
come here .
you should just tell him the truth .
it &apos;s just gonna make things worse .
how ?
how could it possibly make things any worse ?
what do you wanna do ?
do you wanna waltz into rosewood pd
and tell them to slap cuffs on a girl with no hands ?
she has hands . and yes ,
if i was sure that it was sara harvey
who &apos;s behind all of this .
but she shut her spy hole , and she &apos;s left town .
wait . you don &apos;t think it &apos;s her ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe there &apos;s somebody who &apos;s helping her ?
but whoever it is , they &apos;re getting impatient .
because if we don &apos;t give them the killer
in the next couple of days then ...
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not gonna let anybody hurt you .
it &apos;s kind of hard for me to take comfort from that
when you still have blood coming out of your nose , okay .
come here .
there .
i &apos;d rather have toby hate me now
than blame me later , you know ?
i know .
you did not have to do all this .
i would &apos;ve been fine just eating leftovers from the wedding .
no , that &apos;s what an expense account is for .
taking my girlfriend out for a porcini omelet
and billing it as lunch with a client .
well , it &apos;s funny
because that may not be as big a lie as you think .
ezra called jillian
to try and get me off the hook and
ended up asking for me to be his co @-@ author .
i mean , obviously , i had no idea
that he was gonna do that .
he didn &apos;t even
have any idea he was gonna do that .
oh , yeah , he did .
it wasn &apos;t an accident . he didn &apos;t fall off a bicycle .
he made a decision .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is a great opportunity
and i &apos;m really happy for you .
you &apos;re gonna be a published author .
that &apos;s amazing .
is this your way of thanking me ?
sorry ?
the leak . about yvonne ?
okay , caleb and i had nothing to do with it .
how do i know that you didn &apos;t do it ?
i mean , accusing other people of something that you &apos;ve done
that does have kind of a vintage mona quality about it .
unbelievable .
i genuinely do something good and i end up paying for it ?
because of the leak , the phillips team
has gone through everything with a fine @-@ toothed comb .
my gift of your mom &apos;s medical records was discovered .
i &apos;ve been fired , my credibility is shot
my future jeopardized , and now
the one person who should be kissing my feet
is here accusing me of screwing her .
yeah , she &apos;s a powerful character .
thank you .
oh , i @-@ i really like , uh , what you did .
the end of chapter five , the passage--
oh , good . good , good .
yes .
yeah , i @-@ i love this section here about the bridge .
do you actually think it works ?
i was trying to make it a metaphor for the ...
yeah , no , it &apos;s great .
i totally got it .
great .
oh , um , i had a few thoughts this morning .
let &apos;s see this .
uh , that i &apos;d love to talk to you about now ...
if i can just find them .
ezra ...
why do you want me to write with you ?
i @-@ i mean , this would be huge for me
and @-@ and it is not that i don &apos;t think my work is good .
i just ..
i have to ask , &apos; cause , you know ..
well , i do .
well ..
nicole &apos;s voice was , um ..
taken away .
and i wanna give it back .
but i didn &apos;t know her .
i know , that &apos;s why i need you .
&apos;cause i would spend the whole time spinning in place
trying to be faithful to reality , and you &apos;re not ..
tied down by that .
i know it is a lot to ask , but ..
could you please help me with this ?
of course .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve never enjoyed the feeling of deja vu myself .
lieutenant .
would it be possible for me to speak
with miss montgomery alone ?
something wrong ?
that &apos;s kind of an open @-@ ended question .
don &apos;t you think ?
what are you doing here ?
i have an eyewitness from the two crows diner .
they saw the person who called the dilaurentis
on the night of charlotte &apos;s murder .
okay , what does that have to do with me ?
well , maybe nothing . but you fit the description .
and i &apos;d like it if you come in for a line @-@ up .
i gave you my statement .
i didn &apos;t leave the hotel that night .
and i &apos;ve never even been to the two crows diner .
good .
this will give us a chance to eliminate you as a suspect .
come forward , number three .
please step forward .
return to the line .
number four , step forward .
head up , please . face forward !
number four , return to the line .
hi .
um ... i was wondering if anyone
recently brought in a dark gray suv into the shop ?
uh , maybe someone looking to get their muffler--
can &apos;t help you .
okay , does that mean that they haven &apos;t or ..
it means that i can &apos;t help you .
thank you for your help .
what in the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
um , th @-@ this is the truck that i was asking about .
do you know who drove this last night ?
maybe i lent it to a friend . i can &apos;t remember .
okay , um ..
does this happen to be your friend ?
that &apos;s not her .
you need to go .
thank you . miss montgomery , did you forget something ?
is your eyewitness sara harvey ?
we don &apos;t reveal the identity of witnesses .
otherwise , people would be scared to speak up .
oh , i &apos;m sure that she couldn &apos;t wait .
the person that you should be questioning
was on your side of the glass !
just a minute .
yes , lieutenant tanner .
yeah .
give me that name again .
i think we had him in lock up march of last year .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
let me check on his ..
i believe we picked him up on a dv
but i &apos;ll have to check .
i &apos;ll have one of my guys call you back .
okay , okay , yeah , yeah .
now . would you like to fill out the complaint form ?
a complaint form ?
five years ago , you found me , underground ..
i would just think that after everything that &apos;s happened
you would take what i say seriously .
i do .
i take every accusation seriously .
it doesn &apos;t mean i have to act on it right away .
and because of that , you are free to go .
i don &apos;t get it .
if sara was framing us , then why were you free to go ?
maybe that &apos;s what tanner meant when she said
the police don &apos;t always act
on every accusation right away .
so all we can do is wait for the other shoe to drop ?
hanna ? you can &apos;t neglect your other guests .
why don &apos;t you lead the group in some icebreakers ?
sure . as soon as spencer gets here .
well , where is she ?
nice to see how much you take our little chats to heart .
what ?
yeah , less then 24 hours after my request ..
... caleb &apos;s in the house .
dad , he had to get some clothes . and how did you eve--
then a park bench ?
right ?
you cannot just ask me
to cut this person out of my life .
do i look like i &apos;m asking ?
spence , listen ..
... i , i know how painful this is .
and maybe caleb had good intentions
but his actions prove that he doesn &apos;t share
the same value system as this family .
oh , my god .
can you really look at me
and say that with a straight face ?
you are protecting her !
she killed someone , and you shuttle her off to europe ?
what kind of value system is that ?
she didn &apos;t kill anyone . she was being blackmailed .
what are you talking about ?
right before charlotte &apos;s hearing ..
... your sister started getting threatening messages .
someone claimed to have her on tape
confessing to burying bethany .
that can &apos;t be true , dad .
she was told to drop money off
at a disclosed location
or the video would be released .
that &apos;s why she came back to rosewood in secret .
who was blackmailing her ?
she doesn &apos;t know .
but she dropped off the money
and just hoped everything would go away .
then charlotte turned up dead .
o @-@ okay , so then why flee ?
you said that she had nothing to do with it .
she got spooked , spence .
why didn &apos;t you tell her to go to the police ?
i was scared .
okay , i was scared that , like you
they would think she was guilty of more than just being ..
blackmailed ? do we really believe that ?
well , even if it is true , isn &apos;t that more of a reason
melissa would &apos;ve wanted charlotte dead ?
yeah , but charlotte was still on lockdown
when melissa made her first payment .
so what are you saying ?
the person who &apos;s threatening us is probably the same person
who was blackmailing my sister .
i don &apos;t think it was melissa who borrowed that suv .
i looked at the pictures . one look at that crowd
and her argyle socks would have blown off .
which leaves us with nothing .
no , there &apos;s the eyewitness report .
a hot brunette with a cheesy keychain ?
that &apos;s like half this party .
ladies , if you could all move to the sofa .
sweetie , i thought you could open your presents now .
if any of you guys got me some kind of toy
you &apos;re dead .
congratulations , han .
i just wanted to drop that off .
i figured you &apos;d get a kick out of it .
remember the summer before eighth grade ?
we were all set to have double weddings .
i was gonna marry justin timberlake
and ... you were gonna tie the knot with matt damon .
i can &apos;t believe you still have this .
that &apos;s so thoughtful of you , mona .
why don &apos;t you come in for a drink ?
hanna was just about to open more gifts .
i don &apos;t wanna intrude , but ... sure .
okay , uh , it &apos;s time for 21 questions .
this version is
&quot; how well do you know the bride and groom ? &quot;
so whoever gets the most points wins a prize .
so first question for 100 points .
where did jordan propose ?
why is she here ?
i thought you two had it out at the brew .
she brought a gift .
yeah , and an ax to grind .
emily , for 50 points .
do you know this one ?
&quot; how did the bride and groom meet ? &quot;
yeah .
i , i think it was at a work function .
no , no , it was , it was at- at a party .
sorry . spencer ?
wait , i know this .
you know what , this game is kind of silly .
isn &apos;t there one where
everyone takes a shot when you hear the word bride ?
what is wrong with this thing ?
hanna !
i don &apos;t know how to make it stop .
here , here .
what is happening ?
i have no idea .
is that the air conditioner ?
what is that ?
somebody turn it off !
aria !
oh , my god !
okay . yeah , just give me a call .
well , she &apos;s just been admitted to the er .
i mean , she has second @-@ degree burns
but the doctors say that she &apos;s gonna be fine .
how did this even happen ?
why don &apos;t you ask her ?
i mean , is it just a coincidence
that the loft tried to turn aria
into a s &apos;more right after she arrived ?
托比
how long does this take ?
three minutes . said on the package .
i have to go .
who was that ? hannah ?
no , it was
it- it was my dad .
but i &apos;ll call you later .
bye .
do you wanna talk about it ?
talk about what ?
what we &apos;re gonna do if--
toby , i &apos;m a sophomore ... okay ?
i &apos;m having a hard enough time juggling exams .
i know .
and you don &apos;t even live in this state .
i @-@ i know , but i ..
could apply for a transfer .
and what ? you gonna move into my dorm room ?
you don &apos;t have to ..
say it like that .
like what ?
like ... living together
would be such a horrible thing .
in this context , it would be .
i &apos;m sorry , but it would .
you &apos;re ..
talking about this like it would ..
ruin our lives .
i mean , isn &apos;t this what we are planning for ..
eventually ?
i- i don &apos;t know .
you know , i really ..
i hadn &apos;t really thought that far ahead .
i haven &apos;t even made up my mind yet
about grad school , i don &apos;t ..
well , have you @-@ have you made up your mind about me ?
don &apos;t make this about something that it isn &apos;t .
&apos;and what about you ? &apos;
i &apos;m not the only person here who has plans .
you know , you said that you wanted to quit the force
and you said that you wanted to go back to school .
that was your idea , not mine .
and it was only because being with a cop
isn &apos;t good enough for you .
i have never said that , okay ?
i just , i don &apos;t know , i thought that maybe you wanted--
more ?
can we please not do this right now ?
this is really hard .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not trying to make it harder .
&apos;it &apos;s just .. &apos;
... i feel like ..
... when we &apos;re picturing our future together ..
... we &apos;re not ..
... looking at the same picture anymore .
&apos;spencer.&apos;
toby .
um , thanks for coming to see me .
yeah , i @-@ i can &apos;t stay long . i &apos;m on duty so--
yeah , of course .
caleb doesn &apos;t know that i &apos;m here .
if @-@ if you &apos;re gonna try and get me--
he didn &apos;t do it .
okay ? he didn &apos;t leak it .
he &apos;s just taking the blame .
why ?
because &quot; a &quot; is back .
not &quot; a &quot; exactly , just , umm ..
... some copycat version .
what ?
whoever this is thinks that we know who killed charlotte
and so they &apos;re trying to make our lives miserable because of it .
and i &apos;m really sorry , but yvonne was just collateral damage .
and caleb didn &apos;t wanna tell you
because he didn &apos;t wanna put you at risk .
thank you for telling me .
how are you ? are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay .
i just , um ..
... i really couldn &apos;t have you thinking
that i would ever judge yvonne for making that choice .
not after ..
... you and i ..
... almost had to make that choice .
yeah .
i @-@ i gotta go .
okay . how &apos;s yvonne ?
uh , she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s been amazing , you know .
just really strong .
i guess i have a type .
take care of yourself .
you too .
you okay ?
how did you know that i ..
&apos;hannah . she texted me.&apos;
are you in any pain ?
well , they gave me something .
it &apos;s not completely helping .
aria , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
um , i told hannah and her mother
that if they needed rest that i could take you home .
nurse says it &apos;s gonna be a long night .
well ..
... i &apos;m prepared for that .
we have ..
... reading material , uh , spare clothes .
unfortunately , they &apos;re my clothes
but i &apos;m pretty sure we can find some medical tape
that i can just sort of cinch around the top of the sweatpants .
uh , i have gummy bears . i have several sets of ..
don &apos;t be scared .
you want the doctor-- - no .
aria , it &apos;s a terrible accident .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
what ?
what do you mean ?
nothing .
nothing , i ..
it was my fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have been standing so close to the fireplace .
mom , i &apos;m really sorry for being such a bridezilla .
and clearly , i &apos;m the one who hasn &apos;t been including
jordan enough in my life , not the other way around .
can i ask you a question ?
why have you iced out mona ?
i saw the way you and your friends
reacted when she showed up .
