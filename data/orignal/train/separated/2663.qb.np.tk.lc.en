we &apos;re awaiting a statement from senator diaz ,
who has temporarily suspended his presidential campaign
to convene a special hearing to investigate allegations ,
that energy billionaire alexander kirk
has been financing terrorism .
kirk amassed his wealth in the &apos; 90s through mining
and oil operations in russia ,
but fell out of favor with moscow
after a series of politically motivated raids
on kirk &apos;s companies by russian authorities .
he fled the country
and has rarely been seen in public in recent years .
thank you all for coming .
when i announced my candidacy ,
i made the american people a promise
that my desire to run this country in the future
would not interfere with my current obligations
as chairman of the senate energy committee .
i keep my promises .
you &apos;ve all heard the allegation
that alexander kirk is financing terrorism .
sir , can you be more specific ?
he &apos;s purchasing oil from radical jihadists ,
committing a federal crime by supporting the very organizations
that export terror to america .
i will not let one drop of oil into this country
without making sure that ...
wait , he &apos;s sending it here ?
that &apos;s what i intend to find out .
no one in the organization knows anything about this .
they don &apos;t know because it &apos;s not happening .
this is all reddington .
he bought and paid for diaz with my campaign money .
a fact - we can &apos;t use as leverage against diaz --
a revelation like that would hurt you as much as him .
as a foreign national ,
you violated the federal election campaign act
when you donated to an american candidate .
is that right ? you think i don &apos;t kn--
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s not a defense we can use .
don &apos;t do it publicly .
i hired your damn firm for its relationships ...
and influence .
earn your money .
whatever this evidence is ,
you could show up at the hearing and fight it .
i said no .
... a special hearing to investigate . senator diaz ,
who has temporarily suspended his presidential campaign .
alexander .
i want to know if these allegations are true .
let senator diaz know i won &apos;t be at his hearing .
i believe the american people deserve the truth ,
and that &apos;s what my presidency will be about -- transparency .
all right . that &apos;s it . thank you . see you tomorrow .
i have three days to make the ad buys
or my campaign &apos;s over .
i &apos;m doing what you asked .
that money you took -- i need it back .
a good man could make a real difference as president .
a good man might even inspire one &apos;s patriotic instincts ,
but a good man would never allow himself to be put under obligation
to anyone willing to write a big check .
you just had me accuse kirk of something he didn &apos;t do .
what makes you so sure he &apos;s gonna show up ?
don &apos;t underestimate yourself , robert .
one way or another , i &apos;m confident kirk will come .
i &apos;ll have his head ,
and you &apos;ll end up in the oval office ,
where you can pay off your debt to me with a full pardon .
you expect me to pardon you .
not me .
elizabeth keen .
the fbi agent ...
who murdered the attorney general .
she &apos;s dead .
yes .
and i want things put right .
♬ i got the bowling ball blues ♬
♬ when i first started bowling , just a spare was great ♬
♬ and my score looked good at 108 ♬
♬ and they said if i practiced , i could raise my game ♬
♬ so i practiced and i practiced ♬
♬ but i still bowl the same ♬
thank you for coming on short notice .
i understand my associate &apos;s already brought you up to speed
in the basics of the task .
the file ?
♬ and my daughters , too ♬
♬ i think i &apos;ll hang up my bowling ball ♬
♬ my bag and my shoes ♬
everything you asked for .
photos of tom keen , his daughter .
medical records ?
it &apos;s all there .
she was discharged from d.c. general yesterday .
by now , she &apos;s likely under heavy guard .
won &apos;t be a problem .
it can &apos;t be .
mr. kirk was very clear .
take the girl , kill the father .
understood ?
♬ are in a heck of a mess ♬
she reminds me of elizabeth .
thank you , kate .
for everything .
no thanks necessary .
all i care about is agnes &apos; well @-@ being .
saw the news conference .
what &apos;s the word on kirk ?
is he coming ?
it &apos;s under control .
that &apos;s not how this works .
we have an understanding -- i let you into agnes &apos; life
and you let me help bring down kirk .
if you have the spare time ,
i would think you &apos;d be spending it
trying to learn about your parents .
i understand scottie hargrave offered you a job .
she &apos;ll have to wait .
you must have many questions .
yeah .
but right now , the only question that matters
is where are you on finding kirk ?
in exchange for getting his campaign funds back ,
senator diaz agreed to pressure alexander kirk
to come to america .
we &apos;re giving it back , the money we stole ?
why did we take it in the first place ?
i thought taking kirk &apos;s money
would be enough to smoke him out . it wasn &apos;t .
and as i understand it ,
he &apos;s already sent word to the good senator
that he &apos;s disinclined to testify before the committee
and answer to what , as of now , are false charges .
diaz accused him of buying oil from radical jihadists .
you &apos;re saying that never happened .
correct .
but i felt it was just the kind of lie diaz would enjoy telling ,
as it &apos;ll inevitably score him political points --
hit the sweet spot of jingoistic outrage .
so kirk &apos;s not financing terrorism .
not yet .
why don &apos;t i like the sound of this ?
the oil you had us intercept from kerogent in amsterdam --
that came from terrorists .
that &apos;s why you hijacked it before it made it into evidence .
no . i hijacked it because ... i &apos;m a criminal .
i &apos;m parting with it
because alexander kirk needs to be killed ,
and if it takes planting a little evidence on him ...
so be it .
is there any line you don &apos;t expect us to cross ?
yes . this one .
i don &apos;t expect you to dirty your hands planting the illicit oil .
i simply need you to arrest kirk &apos;s employees
once they possess it .
and how is any of that gonna happen ?
have a little faith , harold .
lord , guide us on this long and treacherous journey ,
for judgement is coming .
judgement walks among us ,
and lord knows when it comes for you ,
there will be nowhere left to run
but the waiting arms of the lord .
amen , brothers . amen .
thanks -- thank y &apos;all for coming in .
may god keep you safe out there .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . god bless you .
i appreciate it . thank you .
thank you . thank you .
god bless . thank you .
powerful sermon ,
especially for an old faker like yourself .
i know it &apos;s important for you to know what &apos;s moving where ,
but damn it , red , i &apos;m three ex @-@ wives into this ministry .
and seven children .
you &apos;re like a rockstar without the income .
and i appreciate your help with the child @-@ support payments .
i do .
the good book .
we &apos;ve had a lot of precious cargo move through this week .
big @-@ screen tvs , 4k -- that &apos;s the good stuff .
designer suits , brand @-@ name pharmaceuticals .
a lot of poaching options ,
but nothing you &apos;d be interested in .
actually , i &apos;m looking for something very specific .
what can you tell me about a gas company called nexaco ?
hello .
tom , it &apos;s dr. swanson .
thank you for calling me back .
listen , we got the panels back ,
and i just wanted to put your mind at ease .
everything looks great .
agnes has a clean bill of health .
just keep her on the feeding plan --
continuous supplements ,
and i &apos;d like to see her again in two weeks .
uh , thank you , dr. swanson , for everything .
i appreciate it .
there .
i did what you asked .
please .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
did you get it ?
triangulation looks good .
we &apos;ve got a location on keen .
alexander kirk owns companies all over the world ,
including a prominent energy subsidiary here in america --
nexaco gas --
that supplies gasoline to stations all over the country .
reddington &apos;s gonna intercept one of his trucks
and swap out the tanker with one full of the contraband oil .
how ?
according to reddington &apos;s source ,
nexaco trucks make regular supply runs
to kirk &apos;s refineries in baton rouge .
one of the drivers makes a regular stop
to pick up lunch at a place off of route 17 .
they &apos;ll have less than 10 minutes to make the switch .
doesn &apos;t leave a lot of room for error .
what exactly is his plan ?
what &apos;s the difference
between the pastrami swiss cheese dog with sauerkraut
and the reuben dog ?
aren &apos;t those the same ?
honestly , the amount of options overwhelms .
serial number &apos;s 513 .
see you on the other side .
hey ... buddy .
okay .
here we go .
i know what you need , huh ?
there , buddy .
all right . okay .
we &apos;re all friends .
and come on , come on , come on .
come on .
there . you want to go for a little ride ?
go .
so it &apos;ll be one chicago double dog ,
hold the pickles , and one , uh ...
the , uh , brooklyn baconeer with cheese .
oh , and throw in some of those house @-@ made sea @-@ salt chips .
will that be all ?
what do you recommend on the dessert front ?
you know what ?
toss in two of those little fried pies .
you only live once , right ?
thank you . excuse me .
hi .
chili dog , fries , to go .
you &apos;re good to roll .
34 ?
go easy on those doughnuts , all right ?
really , boscoe ?
what &apos;s the problem ?
we &apos;re operating on credible intelligence
that you &apos;re transporting smuggled crude .
smuggled crude ?
what are you -- i &apos;m hauling gasoline .
you want my papers ?
actually , we &apos;re gonna need to see your product .
does that look like 87 % octane to you ?
i don &apos;t know anything about this .
hands behind your back .
come on .
the fbi just released a statement .
the oil they recovered has high ch4 levels
chemically consistent with crude originating from northern syria .
they &apos;re saying it was en route
to one of your refineries on the gulf coast .
clever .
reddington &apos;s moving beyond theoretical accusations .
we spoke to our u.s. contacts ,
including senator bolson , the majority leader .
he has a lot of sway with koepke and talbot
on the energy committee , however --
let me guess .
they &apos;re less inclined to go to bat for us
now that there &apos;s actual evidence .
they &apos;re not gonna stick their necks out for a foreigner
who &apos;s hiding from the u.s. investigative process .
which is why we &apos;re hoping you &apos;ll reconsider your position
and show up for the hearing .
cooperate .
act like a friend
and your powerful friends will respond in kind .
and if i don &apos;t , i &apos;ll be indicted .
justice department will freeze all your american assets --
billions of dollars .
your most prized asset in the u.s. will be lost .
get the senator on the phone .
so , uh ... it worked .
yeah .
apparently , kirk had a change of heart
and he &apos;s flying in tomorrow for the meeting .
you know what that means , right ?
you know what mr. reddington &apos;s gonna do .
i &apos;m not okay with this .
are you ?
these charges against alexander kirk
for financing terrorism are ludicrous .
and no one &apos;s gonna touch him for what happened to elizabeth .
so i &apos;m gonna kill him .
he won &apos;t live long enough to see
the inside of that hearing room .
i &apos;m gonna kill him the instant he steps out of his vehicle .
you and i both know ...
nothing less will protect agnes
and avenge elizabeth &apos;s death .
red ... how come --
harold , you and your people ...
i will always be more grateful than i could ever express
but i don &apos;t expect --or rather ,
i couldn &apos;t accept your involvement in this final act .
i entered into this relationship with my eyes wide open .
so did agent ressler and the others .
i admire that about you , harold .
i know so many zealots , men and women who choose a side ,
an ideology by which to interpret the world ,
but to get up every single day
and do the hard work of deciding what to believe ,
what &apos;s right today , when to stand up or stand down ...
that &apos;s courage .
it &apos;s been a privilege ...
to see firsthand
why the people you lead love you the way they do .
but sadly , our time together has come to an end .
on this case .
you don &apos;t mean -- - i do .
we &apos;ve done some good work .
but with elizabeth gone ...
there &apos;s ...
nothing more for me to contribute .
please take care of yourself and the others .
charlene .
aram -- set him up with someone , for god &apos;s sake .
he &apos;s like a kid with his first erection on the school bus .
raymond .
thank you .
i just got to pick up a few things --
paper towels , formula , diapers -- the usual .
do you want me to grab you
some of those little sandwiches that you like ?
thanks , i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s all clear . i &apos;ll be outside .
be quick .
yeah .
okay , what do you think ?
red can or green can ?
i agree . green it is .
she &apos;s beautiful .
thank you . i dig the bow tie .
what happened to you ?
i spit up on myself . what do you think happened ?
will you watch the cart ? we got to go wash up .
i &apos;m coming with you .
i think i can find the bathroom on my own , thanks .
mr. reddington left specific instructions
not to let the kid out of our sight .
i &apos;ll take the child .
thank you .
go .
okay , sweetheart .
she has a real round head .
oh , my god .
he was right here !
i don &apos;t know what happened to him .
that &apos;s him ! that &apos;s my son .
no , oh , wait . what are you talking about ?
ma &apos;am , i need you to hand over the boy .
hold on .
i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding here .
her name &apos;s agnes .
we &apos;re just waiting for her father .
look . i don &apos;t know how this happened .
i &apos;m so sorry .
they must &apos;ve gotten mixed up somehow .
tom gave us the slip .
he left with the baby .
something &apos;s going on .
i think they lost him .
what makes you say that ?
because i &apos;m still tracking his cell signal ,
and it &apos;s moving west on millbank .
vector me .
kirk &apos;s flight just arrived .
what &apos;s the security ?
he brought his own team .
there &apos;ll be a convoy of at least three vehicles .
minimum of 8 to 10 men .
put everly in the veterans building , looking west .
sandoval to the south .
our source says the capitol police
have asked the bureau to assist with security .
they &apos;re expanding the perimeter . baz .
advanced teams will be all over the veterans building .
every window and roof within 200 yards
will be scoped and cleared .
we need to find another perch with a clear line of sight ,
and we need to find it now .
i want you to get on the faa database ,
pull a flight plan for me .
it &apos;s a hawker 400 , november @-@ 6 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 2 @-@ delta .
you have an update for me ?
there &apos;s gonna be a delay .
keen went awol ,
just boarded a flight to baracoa with his daughter
traveling under an alias .
i &apos;ll get in touch with our contacts in cuba .
in the meantime , you get on a plane and get down there .
we need that child in our custody by the end of the day .
hey , gentlemen , put down your hammers .
it &apos;s time for recess .
simon says put your hands on your heads .
let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t fret .
we won &apos;t be long .
my associate will keep you company
until our business is finished .
this &apos;ll work nicely .
everly , right there .
you can &apos;t do this .
agent ressler .
aren &apos;t you the dog on a scent ?
there was one empty building
with a line of sight to the front and one to the back .
started with the front .
you spoke to harold .
reddington , grab the guy , put him in a hole ,
get what you need from him , but don &apos;t kill kirk .
there &apos;s nothing i care to take from alexander kirk
except his life .
‭ trust me . i want him as badly as you ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let this happen .
oh , this is gonna happen , donald .
this is gonna happen in about 10 minutes .
i just heard back from our man in baracoa .
and ?
he checked with his local sources .
an american recently purchased a villa
on the western edge of town .
high walls , very private .
that &apos;s where you think keen &apos;s taking his daughter ?
we sent a team down to do some initial recon ,
and you need to see this .
senator diaz , we &apos;re hearing that the fbi
made a seizure yesterday in connection to this case .
can you comment ?
we recovered raw syrian crude
from one of kirk &apos;s gasoline tankers .
mr. kirk has a lot to answer for ,
and he &apos;ll be given every opportunity to do so
in today &apos;s hearing .
thank you .
we &apos;re told that kirk &apos;s arrival is imminent .
do you have a minute ?
we can &apos;t reach ressler .
he left , and he &apos;s not answering his cell .
you think he went to find reddington ?
probably .
he &apos;d never admit it ,
but i think he took liz &apos;s death
almost as hard as aram did .
we are still waiting outside the courthouse ...
so it &apos;s happening .
kirk is here .
touched down a few minutes ago .
... alexander kirk to arrive .
we &apos;re gonna take a closer look ...
are you all right ?
a man got off that plane ,
and he has no idea that he &apos;ll be dead within the hour .
i &apos;ve spent my entire life in the service
of stopping people who do what we &apos;re about to let happen .
not so long ago , this task force felt compelled
to hunt down elizabeth keen for intentionally killing a man .
now she &apos;s gone ,
and we &apos;re about to do the very same thing .
if you &apos;re asking whether you &apos;ll regret it someday ...
no .
i don &apos;t think you will .
to be honest , i crossed that line a long time ago --
killing in the name of justice , vengeance .
after a while , you don &apos;t just get over it ...
you get used to it .
... export terror to america .
i believe ...
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
... and that &apos;s what my presidency would be about .
listen to me . if he pulls that trigger ,
this building &apos;s surrounded in seconds .
not minutes -- seconds . there &apos;s no getting out .
yes , i know .
if liz were here , she &apos;d tell you not to do this .
elizabeth isn &apos;t here , though . is she , donald ?
that was mr. kaplan . keen made a move .
he took agnes .
i want to know where .
kaplan &apos;s on it .
step away .
donald .
i meant what i said .
this isn &apos;t gonna happen .
i said stand down .
look , reddington .
if you want your man to live ,
you &apos;re gonna tell him to do what i say .
it &apos;s okay , everly .
step away . go find baz . give him a hand .
all right .
let &apos;s everyone take a deep breath .
everybody relax .
all right . nobody &apos;s gonna get hurt .
kirk &apos;s 60 seconds out .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i was willing to fire on your man ,
and i &apos;m willing to fire on you .
yes , i believe that , donald .
but are you willing to die in the process ?
i said step away .
you want justice for elizabeth .
justice , not vengeance .
in my experience , they &apos;re the same .
what are you gonna do , dembe ?
you gonna shoot me in cold blood ?
40 seconds .
i know how difficult this must be for you , donald .
i will do this .
you have faith .
i envy that .
justice , integrity , faith in humanity --
nobody embodies those principles more than you .
20 .
and i know it must be hard for you to believe
that you &apos;ll continue to embody those principles
even after you watch me do this .
oh , this isn &apos;t about me .
this is about the rules -- what &apos;s right .
when elizabeth was a fugitive , you played by the rules ,
did what you thought was right .
but elizabeth &apos;s gone .
alexander kirk took her away from us ,
and she &apos;s not coming back .
raymond .
take your hands off that trigger .
what do you think &apos;s going to happen if you stop me , donald ?
that you &apos;ll arrest kirk ?
that justice will be done ?
let go of the weapon .
do you want a bullet in alexander kirk &apos;s head
or one in mine ?
decide now .
what &apos;s it going to be , donald ?
what ?
it &apos;s not kirk .
he &apos;s not there .
unfortunately , mr. kirk wasn &apos;t able
to attend today &apos;s hearing due to an unexpected development .
i &apos;ll be testifying on his behalf .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought we confirmed kirk on that flight .
aram , the manifest .
i &apos;m looking at it now .
kirk was definitely a passenger on that jet .
not only that , he was pre @-@ cleared by u.s. customs
and border protection at abu dhabi airport .
he &apos;s here .
then why wasn &apos;t he in that car ?
i don &apos;t know . wait .
wait , this can &apos;t ...
there &apos;s a second flight plan ,
a new one , filed a few minutes ago .
kirk &apos;s plane just took off again .
to where ?
abel santamaria airport in cuba .
i don &apos;t understand .
why would kirk clear american customs ,
fly all the way to d.c. , just to turn around and go to cuba ?
something changed his mind .
aram , run another search .
every private flight to abel santamaria
from the d.c. area in the last six hours .
what are we looking for ?
tom and agnes .
he slipped my security detail earlier today .
nothing .
well , he wouldn &apos;t be traveling under the name keen .
okay , hang on . there is something .
a hawker 400 november @-@ 6 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 2 @-@ delta
left a private airstrip for cuba with two passengers --
a man and his infant daughter .
my god .
kirk &apos;s going after agnes .
aram , the plane tom was on .
who owns it ?
reddington ! hey !
ow ! what the hell ? !
what &apos;s going on , omar ?
i &apos;ve known you for over two decades .
i was there when you renewed your vows with eileen .
and suddenly , you &apos;re the person
who takes tom keen and his child out of the country ?
out of my sight ?
i don &apos;t know any tom keen .
wrong answer .
stop , please .
of all the people with a private air fleet ,
keen just picks your name out of a hat ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i was under the impression
arranging this flight is exactly what you wanted .
why in god &apos;s name would you think that ?
red , i would never do anything to upset you .
i just assumed when kaplan came to see me ,
she was coming on your behalf .
kaplan .
she made all the arrangements .
she had all the documentation
for your friend and his daughter .
i just did what she asked .
raymond , i &apos;m sorry .
i have nothing for you , kate .
no parables about loyalty ,
no florid speeches of trust belied ,
deception , treachery ,
or false devotion .
i &apos;m simply too bereft .
it will have to suffice to say ...
i would name every human being on the planet before you
if asked who might betray me .
raymond -- - i know what you &apos;ve done .
i know you helped tom and agnes leave the country
without my knowledge .
yes .
yes .
what do you want to know , raymond ?
if i &apos;m sorry ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry you weren &apos;t more honest with elizabeth
from the beginning .
i &apos;m sorry you wanted to know her so desperately
that you convinced yourself we could keep her safe .
i couldn &apos;t sit back
and watch you make the same mistake with agnes .
i didn &apos;t betray you .
i did what i &apos;ve always done -- protected you ...
this time , from yourself .
you &apos;re wrong .
i won &apos;t tell you where they are .
you don &apos;t understand , kate .
i know where they are , and so does alexander kirk .
kirk ?
he was tracking tom .
he knows they &apos;re in cuba .
he &apos;s flying there as we speak .
no .
i need an address .
i know you had her best interests at heart ,
that you were trying to protect her ,
but now , because of you , agnes is in grave danger .
not just agnes .
you made it .
oh , my god .
oh , she &apos;s beautiful .
just like her mother .
are we okay ?
liz , it &apos;s over .
there &apos;s nobody coming after us .
it &apos;s just you and me ...
and her .
we did it .
we &apos;re free .
how ?
the how won &apos;t change anything .
i suppose i knew what i would do
that afternoon in the car on the drive to the mobile icu .
that poor girl , so afraid .
always looking over her shoulder ,
in the dark about who she was and why it mattered .
but it wasn &apos;t just about elizabeth anymore .
her child was already paying the price
for her association with you .
no . get out .
please , go away . make him go away .
this is my daughter .
just wait out here .
let me talk to her .
i saw my opportunity .
i know you &apos;re afraid , sweetie .
you should be .
agnes will never be safe in raymond &apos;s world .
the question is , how far are you willing to go to protect her ?
i saw her die .
you saw what the doctor allowed you to see .
if he finds out , he &apos;ll kill me .
i can keep this from him , protect you .
just tell me what you need .
this is insane . it &apos;ll never work .
maybe not , but we have to try .
most heart monitors come with simulation devices
for training purposes .
all i have to do is connect her heart leads to the simulator
and i can make her vitals do whatever we want --
raise her heart rate , drop her oxygen levels ,
crashing her blood pressure .
what else ?
if i can make liz seem unstable enough ,
it would be indicated for me to put her on a ventilator
in a medically induced coma .
but there &apos;s a risk .
of course there &apos;s a risk for all of us ,
but it &apos;s possible , right ?
what &apos;s possible ?
i sat over her body ...
and watched her die .
you saw what we needed you to see .
once she was safe on the ventilator ,
one large dose of a beta blocker
dropped her cardiac output and pulse to a level
just barely detectable under the best of circumstances ,
let alone with a gunfight raging outside .
you didn &apos;t want her body taken to the morgue .
that made things easier .
elizabeth was in the body bag for less than two minutes .
nik was standing by with the antidote , glucagon .
i found a suitable body for the funeral .
need i continue ?
had it really come to that ?
she loved her daughter that much .
yes , raymond .
it had come to that .
hey , i &apos;m back .
i found the cutest little bakery on the beach .
they make those little pastelitos that you love .
donald .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
come in . sit down .
a couple hours ago ,
i had the opportunity to stop reddington .
he was ready to ... take one life to avenge another ,
and in the end , i , uh ...
i was gonna let him do it .
i actually wanted him to do it .
thank god kirk wasn &apos;t in that car .
well , now we know why .
reddington called from the air .
let &apos;s hope he gets to tom and agnes .
and liz .
she &apos;s alive .
