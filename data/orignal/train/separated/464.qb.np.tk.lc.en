we are in the noontime jam .
and it &apos;s another gorgeous day here in the big d.
be good to yourself folks ,
go out and have some fresh air in a day like today .
tomorrow is not gonna work ,
i want those files on my desk ...
who does she think she is ?
i &apos;m not gonna put up the files ...
you are such a chicken .
i &apos;m not !
you &apos;ve been mooning over him for three month now ,
the one time he looked at you ,
you actually run the office direction .
because our boss was calling me .
yeah , right .
personally , i don &apos;t know what you see in him .
uh , he &apos;s incredibly hot ?
i think he &apos;s kind of creepy .
all those programmers are weird .
creepy in a cool way .
oh , my god , there he is .
so , go invite him to lunch .
i can &apos;t .
ok , fine , i will .
no , you won &apos;t .
watch me .
hi , axel , i &apos;m brooke , one of the interns in--
nothing &apos;s wrong , will . it &apos;s just work .
yeah , i love you , too . i &apos;ll talk to you as soon as i can .
what &apos;s going on ?
don &apos;t know . just heard we &apos;re leaving now .
there &apos;s been a mass sniper shooting in dallas .
how many victims ?
still unclear . 3 confirmed deaths so far .
we don &apos;t know much beyond that .
is it a terrorist attack ?
well , if it is , they &apos;re happening more frequently .
first the boston marathon , then the cleaver incident in london .
we &apos;re also coming upon the 50th anniversary
of the assassination of jfk ,
which also took place in dallas .
so we have to consider domestic terrorism .
right now we have to consider everything .
garcia , i need a list of all acts of civil unrest
in texas in the last few years .
copy that .
local fbi &apos;s on the scene .
we &apos;ll take the lead when we get there .
be safe .
continuing our breaking story now at archer plaza ,
first responders ...
it &apos;s been a scene of absolute terror and chaos ...
american has become a land of gun @-@ toting lunatics .
how many more children ...
the real problem is , no one cares . this--
this will be in the news
until the next reality star has a baby .
america has something called the constitution ...
police still have no idea who the shooter was .
this is what we do know .
shots were fired at archer plaza
by an unseen sniper at 12 : 27 p.m.
every floor of the surrounding buildings ...
3 people are confirmed dead ,
but authorities are trying to determine
if this was possibly a domestic terrorist attack
or the act of a single madman .
stay with us as this story continues to unfold .
final shot
it &apos;s worse than we thought .
5 confirmed dead , sixth victim is still alive .
he &apos;s in surgery now .
this is agent mays .
she &apos;s in charge of reviewing surveillance footage .
these gentlemen are from the bau .
ssas hotchner and rossi .
we understand there were 12 shots fired ?
yes , that &apos;s right . at 0.8 @-@ second intervals .
so this entire thing was over in 10 seconds .
any footage of potential suspects ?
well , i &apos;m still looking .
based on the trajectory ,
we know that he was shooting from a high vantage point .
unfortunately , none of the camera angles caught that .
but we do think he was shooting from the north end of the plaza .
area &apos;s been sealed off .
going 4 by 4 through each building .
shooter &apos;s gotta be long gone by now .
any eyewitness accounts ?
well , they run the gamut .
the only thing that &apos;s consistent is how inconsistent they are .
we should monitor social media for any leads .
we &apos;ll do that , but in my opinion ,
nothing beats good old @-@ fashioned investigating .
no argument here .
agent mays , why don &apos;t you head on down ,
help the bau in the plaza .
will do .
what do we know about the victims ?
let me show you .
the first victim was axel greiner ,
computer programmer .
daniel bukowski , assistant d.a.
alice emerson was a social worker .
melanie chen , financial advisor .
ricardo hernandez , a sales manager .
kyle yates , the final victim ,
is the one that &apos;s still alive and in surgery .
he was a waiter at the golden oaks grill .
victimology is across the board .
random targets would be consistent
with terrorist attacks ,
but we should still look into backgrounds .
we &apos;re on that . first victim used to be a hacker .
we &apos;re focusing on him .
you receive any general threats recently ?
of an al @-@ qaeda nature ?
no .
what about left- or right @-@ wing extremists ,
perhaps to commemorate an anniversary ?
you talking jfk ?
we &apos;ve had an uptick in crazy calls and letters recently .
do you think this is connected ?
well , the shots happened at 12 : 27 .
kennedy was killed at 12 : 30 .
the locations are close .
can &apos;t ignore the coincidence .
maybe after 50 years someone &apos;s making a statement .
what are you doing here ?
did you hear about the shooting ?
of course . it &apos;s insane .
they &apos;re closing in . we have to go . now .
agent mays .
agent morgan . agent jareau .
12 shots were fired ?
that &apos;s right .
it sounds like an amateur .
you think ?
well , 6 people were hit .
that &apos;s a 50 % success rate .
during a crowded lunch hour with a high @-@ powered rifle ,
at a range of 200 yards ,
an average joe could have hit that many people .
trained snipers hit 98 % of their targets .
what about the shots that missed ?
did you locate all those rounds ?
only two so far . one was in a tree ,
one was lodged in a planter .
there &apos;s something up there .
it looks like it came from a large @-@ caliber rifle .
can i get that extracted ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
send it for analysis .
right away .
so this guy hit a building
12 feet up in the air ?
he had terrible aim ,
or he was just spraying his gunfire .
maybe .
it doesn &apos;t look like the unsub
was focused on a particular area .
the victims are spread throughout the plaza .
is that the one who &apos;s still alive ?
yeah . that &apos;s kyle yates .
based on the position of his body ,
he was facing north .
if he was the last one shot ,
he may have actually seen something .
colin , slow down . i have to stop .
we can &apos;t !
just wait . are you sure this is about us ?
without a doubt . we are being hunted .
if we don &apos;t run , we won &apos;t survive .
now let &apos;s go .
i already told the other agents
everything i remembered .
i understand .
but sometimes details come back to people
hours or even days after the event .
brooke , if you wouldn &apos;t mind ,
try closing your eyes and just listening to my voice .
you &apos;re walking across the plaza .
how does it feel outside ?
it &apos;s really nice . warm , but not too hot .
all right . where are you going ?
to get burgers with casey . i &apos;m annoyed .
why ?
&apos;cause casey &apos;s bugging me .
but then i see axel .
what happens next ?
i walk up and say hi .
and then ...
what do you see ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
all right , it &apos;s all right . we &apos;ll stop .
i saw him dead . it was awful . i ...
uh ... i &apos;m so sorry .
but you &apos;re ok . you &apos;re safe .
i saw him .
i didn &apos;t remember until your partner was talking to brooke .
who did you see ?
there was a guy in a window up high .
what did he look like ?
he was white and bald ,
but it was far away and just for a second
and then he disappeared .
it could have been the shooter , right ?
excuse me .
what happened ?
kyle yates , the sixth victim , just died .
homeland security &apos;s interviewing locals on their watch list .
and all the bureau &apos;s resources
are at our disposal .
we don &apos;t hear that too often .
go ahead , garcia .
you know i love a juicy conspiracy
because it makes everything
seem like an agatha christie novel ,
and i am still convinced
that there was a second shooter on that grassy knoll .
but try as i might ,
i can &apos;t find anything connecting today &apos;s shooting
with the kennedy assassination .
what about the increase in calls
and letters to the dallas office ?
i have checked all the assassination buffs
and conspiracy theorists , including myself ,
and i &apos;m sort of sad to say we &apos;re all in the clear .
what about the acts of civil unrest ?
oh , that . well , i have a treasure trove
of terrible tidbits for you .
well , give us the highlights .
uh , let &apos;s see . in 2009 was that awful thing at fort hood
where the u.s. army psychiatrist killed 13 people .
if you fast @-@ forwarded this past march ,
the head of colorado &apos;s prison system was killed in his home .
that led to a police chase that ended in texas ,
where authorities killed the suspect ,
who was a white supremacist , in a shootout .
anything more recent ?
yes , yes , there is . 3 months ago
a dallas black councilman , adrian clay ,
was shot to death in a parking lot .
witnesses claim the man
responsible is the head of the southern aryans .
his name is adam dawson , aka the general .
that case is currently being prosecuted ,
meanwhile the general is in jail serving time
for a totally unrelated charge .
thanks , garcia .
yes , of course .
that &apos;s a lot of activity for the white supremacists .
they may be waging a new kind of war .
great view from up here .
nice sniper perch .
yeah . these aren &apos;t the kind of windows that open at all , though .
uh , how long has this space been under renovation ?
building manager said about 3 weeks .
hey , ladies . take a look at this .
smooth lines , made by a glass cutter .
the sniper could have shot right through here .
it &apos;s the perfect location .
he could have walked in and out as a worker .
and he carried his weapon in a toolbox or a supply container .
other workers would have seen him .
except it was 12 : 27 and they would he been on their lunch break .
which means he scoped out this location beforehand .
hey , rossi , what &apos;s up ?
the analysis is back on the bullets found in the plaza .
the lands and grooves tell us
they were fired from a .308 nemesis .
it &apos;s a semi @-@ automatic rifle .
same type of weapon used in the murder
of the black texas councilman 3 months ago .
so maybe the southern aryans
are waging a war against the general population ?
it &apos;s more specific than that . victim number two ,
daniel bukowski , was prosecuting the head of the southern aryans
for the murder of the councilman .
so today &apos;s shooting could
have been a follower who wanted revenge .
or it was a hit called by the leader ,
who , by the way , denies he &apos;s even a member of the group .
he claims to have quit well before the councilman &apos;s murder ,
which is the basis of his defense .
well , i think it &apos;s time to have a little talk with the general .
yeah , i admit i was once affiliated with the southern aryans ,
but that was a mistake and it was a long time ago .
look . i even had my tattoos removed .
do you know why we &apos;re here ?
well , i imagine it &apos;s about the murder of that councilman adrian clay ,
which i swear i had no involvement in .
are you still in contact with members of the southern aryans ?
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m in prison .
my opportunities to , uh , socialize
are somewhat limited .
well , that &apos;s not what we heard .
rumor has it you &apos;re in charge .
in fact , you &apos;re still known as the general .
some folks would like to imbue me
with a great deal of power ,
but it &apos;s a mantle i choose not to accept .
so you could call the shots .
you just choose not to ?
how can i lead when i no longer believe ?
all right , derek ,
well , we &apos;re wasting our time here .
i just have a few more questions .
no , really , let &apos;s just go .
no , no , hey . hey .
hold tight .
it &apos;ll only take a second .
what do you know about today &apos;s events ?
today &apos;s events ?
you must have heard about the shooting ?
enlighten me .
the assistant d.a. prosecuting you
for the murder of the black councilman was killed .
did you order that hit ?
i had nothing to do with it .
because you &apos;re not racist anymore ?
mr. dawson , i can &apos;t tell you
how impressed i am with you .
so i &apos;d like to shake your hand
and congratulate you
for making such a positive change in your life .
i &apos;d be really careful ,
because somebody might think you still believe .
the guy had no idea .
i mean , he &apos;s racist as hell ,
but he did not have the assistant d.a. killed .
he was way too surprised when we broke the news .
he was way too angry at us to even be happy about it .
this is the only case the assistant d.a. was trying
he has not other know enemies ,
which means he wasn &apos;t the specific target .
ok , well , who else uses a .308 rifle ?
in texas ?
hunters , the minutemen , housewives .
which unfortunately doesn &apos;t narrow down the field .
well , the 6 bullets that didn &apos;t hit people have all been found .
they were in the cafe sign , planters , and a couple of trees .
it all points to him not being a very good shot .
or maybe he &apos;s a great shot .
according to the doctors at the hospital ,
all 6 victims were hit with kill shots
directly to the head , base of neck , and heart .
the sixth victim only survived because of an anatomic anomaly .
he had a reversed heart ,
but the bullet still tore through major arteries
and they couldn &apos;t save him .
so what seems to be disorganized shooting
is actually organized and intentional .
a forensic countermeasure ?
to make law enforcement believe
the unsub &apos;s not a specially @-@ trained shooter .
which means the victims weren &apos;t random at all .
he knew exactly who he wanted to kill .
so if it wasn &apos;t the attorney , who &apos;s the real target ?
不要报警 否则我会知道
i sent what you wanted . tell me my family is safe .
there are 3 victims , but a witness said
that they heard more than 7 gunshots .
no one ever saw the shooter .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re dealing with a terrorist .
we passed a mall less than a half mile away .
i--i &apos;m not following you .
well , a mall presents a target @-@ rich environment for a terrorist
who wants to incite panic and fear ,
and if that was his aim , he would have been more effective there .
so choosing this gas station instead means what ?
he must have been going after a specific person or people .
we should be trying to make a connection
between the victims here and in the plaza .
considering the position of the bodies
and the fact that no one saw him ,
he had to be shooting from over there .
the easiest way to stay hidden
would have been from the back of a van
or the trunk of a car parked here .
like the d.c. snipers in &apos; 02 .
a smart move would have been
to stay put for a while after all the mayhem .
driving off right away would have just drawn attention .
how much variation is there in the traffic pattern here ?
this is it . it &apos;s pretty much the same all the time ,
except in the middle of the night maybe .
so the unsub had to time his shot to the quarter second
to shoot between traffic and the gas pumps
and hit all 3 victims .
and he did it from a concealed position .
he &apos;s better than good . he &apos;s a sharpshooter .
where are we ?
a safe place to hide for now .
load the mag .
release the safety .
aim , shoot .
what are we doing here ?
waiting for mr. doe . he &apos;s gonna extract us .
what &apos;s his first name ?
john .
john as in john doe ?
his name doesn &apos;t matter .
do you trust him ?
in my line of work , i don &apos;t trust anyone .
but he &apos;ll help us in the situation .
what are you doing ?
blocking the window .
i don &apos;t regret what i did , you know ?
i &apos;m not here to judge .
a month ago i didn &apos;t even know you ,
and now look at us , hiding out together .
you must blame me for dragging you into this .
it was my choice to take the job .
it was all worth it , wasn &apos;t it ,
for a chance at real happiness ?
it &apos;s not for me to say .
but if you cross powerful people ,
there are consequences .
you don &apos;t have to do this , you know .
it &apos;s too late . i &apos;m tied to you now ,
which means they are hunting me , too .
what if there was something--
i thought you said this place was safe .
it is .
but the people coming after us are the best .
we &apos;re looking for an ldsk , or a long distance serial killer .
he &apos;s a very skilled marksman with a god complex .
he derives pleasure out of remaining unseen
and determining the fates of people from afar .
he &apos;s criminally sophisticated and methodical ,
concealing his method of ingress and egress ,
leaving little evidence behind in his sniper perches .
this suggests a great deal of experience ,
so this unsub has a military or law enforcement background ,
possibly even special forces .
his victims at first appear to be targets of opportunity ,
but it now appears that
one or more of them are targets of choice .
the remaining victims are collateral damage
to be used as a forensic countermeasure ,
similar to what john allen muhammad and lee boyd malvo
did with the d.c. sniper case in 2002 .
this means there &apos;s some unknown connection
between one or more victims at the first and second crime scenes .
what about the caucasian male the eyewitness saw at the plaza ?
it &apos;s something to consider , but we can &apos;t rule out others .
we know that the unsub is likely in his late 30s to 40s
in order to have the means and patience
to plan and execute these attacks .
if he still has specific targets ,
it &apos;s likely he won &apos;t wait long to attack ,
so the public needs to remain vigilant .
you never told me why you left south africa .
i was betrayed by people i thought were my friends .
i was labeled a traitor and hung out to dry .
don &apos;t you get lonely doing this work ?
i &apos;m used to it .
i have the network , my business alliances .
like mr. doe .
we &apos;ll take turns keeping watch .
do you know how ?
look out a window ?
it &apos;s not that easy .
there &apos;s actually a skill to it .
you need to be able to identify everything
in your field of vision in two seconds .
what are you looking for ?
close your eyes .
why ?
just do it .
what &apos;s this about ?
ok . open them .
tell me exactly what you saw .
small objects . household things .
describe them .
a button .
what color ?
red .
what else ?
describe the objects .
color and size .
a paperclip .
color and size .
silver . one inch .
there was also a blue rubber band , maybe 4 inches long .
what else ?
i can &apos;t remember anything else .
that &apos;s 3 out of 10 .
you need to do better than that
or you &apos;ll get us both killed .
we know the unsub had a specific target , but who was it ?
well , we checked out ricardo hernandez .
he was going through a divorce .
melanie chen , who &apos;s appealing a custody decision .
but nothing seems out of line .
beside the assistant d.a. ,
no one seems to have any clear enemies .
all right , let &apos;s look at this a different way .
the plaza was an open space .
the unsub would want to make sure that his target couldn &apos;t get away .
how would he ensure that ?
kill his real target first .
too obvious . he would know law enforcement
would focus more on his first victim than the others ,
which your office definitely did .
you know , the fact is ,
this is an experienced sniper
who can account for timing .
after the first shot , no one moves .
people are puzzled .
everyone &apos;s reaction is to look for a source of the sound .
after the second shot , it takes the average person
one and a half seconds to cognitively process
that they &apos;re in a potentially life @-@ threatening situation .
it takes another .7 seconds for a physical response to kick in .
by which time the third shot has already been fired .
so the unsub wanted victim number 3 .
well , anyone after number 3 had a chance of getting away ,
and the unsub wouldn &apos;t have taken that risk .
victim number 3-- alice emerson , 44,
social worker , married with a 12 @-@ year @-@ old son .
husband &apos;s been too distraught to talk .
well , blake and i can see if he &apos;s ready to talk now .
the last 8 years she worked at a women &apos;s shelter downtown .
that can &apos;t be the easiest of jobs .
let &apos;s see if her boss can shed some light .
alice seemed anxious this morning .
i asked her about it and she said her mother
was having a medical procedure done .
so being stressed was out of the ordinary for her ?
well , i won &apos;t lie .
working here does take an emotional toll .
escaping an abusive situation can be incredibly difficult .
i imagine your job &apos;s frustrating .
the victims are a mess , physically , emotionally ,
and they often go back to their abuser .
the fact is most employees burn out .
they don &apos;t work here more than a few years .
it sounds like alice was the exception .
what exactly did her job entail ?
she was the point of first contact .
if a woman was committed to leaving her abuser ,
alice would funnel them to a community angel .
i take it that &apos;s somebody who provides them a temporary home ?
that and more .
they may help create a new identity for the client .
i &apos;m assuming the secrecy is to protect them from their abusers ?
the men that they &apos;re escaping can be incredibly violent
and vindictive .
a whole network has been created
to help protect these women .
sort of like an underground railroad .
exactly .
i just work at the starting point .
i don &apos;t even know all the players in the network .
the police have been through her email and her cell phone
and it seems they &apos;ve been completely wiped clean .
does that have anything to do with this job ?
6 years ago , an angry ex @-@ boyfriend
broke into our computers
and found the location of his girlfriend
and he killed her
and the community angel , she was staying with
before committing suicide .
excuse me .
living with that type of secrecy
is a nightmare for everyone involved .
but i ... get why they have to do it .
you ok ?
for a moment there you looked kind of worried .
yeah , i &apos;m all good .
if you were worried about something , you &apos;d tell me , right ?
spence , i &apos;m not worried
about anything except maybe solving this case .
it &apos;s too bad all those emails and texts are gone forever .
um , i &apos;m sorry , have you ever met penelope garcia ?
alice emerson &apos;s husband said they live a quiet life .
but this morning before the shooting ,
she was acting preoccupied .
when he asked her what was bothering her ,
she said it was something at work .
yet her boss claims she was worried
about a medical procedure her mom was having .
go ahead , garcia .
i am loathe to admit this , but i &apos;m having a hard time
recovering all of alice emerson &apos;s texts and emails .
that company that runs chat alert
is damn good at scrambling their data .
and although i am as fast as hot lightning , my server is not
because it needs updating ,
so if someone with great hair and a tie
could approve the funding to update such server ,
we could get this show on the road and i could--
put in a requisition , garcia .
thank you , sir . filing form 9093b now .
i am familiar with it and the void it disappears into .
ok . i did manage to piece together alice &apos;s last text .
it was sent at 11 : 40,
which is less than an hour before the shooting .
it &apos;s a doozy .
it was sent to a prepaid cell phone and it is this :
&quot; rebecca schroeder . &quot;
you lost me . we &apos;re talking about alice emerson .
i know . and that &apos;s the text she sent ,
that name , rebecca schroeder .
she &apos;s the second shooting victim at the gas station .
yeah . rebecca is an econ professor at east texas college .
she &apos;s 50 , never married and no kids ,
although she does have a sister who lives in austin with 5 kids ,
that she &apos;s close to . she has season tickets to the opera .
beside that , she lives like a monk .
according to her credit card record , she doesn &apos;t even own a pet .
any idea where alice and rebecca &apos;s paths might have crossed ?
no . i ran a cursory search and i &apos;ve come up with nada .
what if rebecca schroeder was a community angel ?
if she was part of the network
that shelters abused women ,
the unsub could be looking for someone they both helped .
alice was the first contact for an abused woman ,
but the unsub needed to know who the woman was handed off to .
in this case it was rebecca .
he may have threatened to kill them or a loved one
if they didn &apos;t give him the information that he wanted .
after they did , he killed them anyway
to bury the evidence and cut off the trail .
it &apos;s probably why he shot at rebecca &apos;s phone .
if alice gave up rebecca &apos;s name ,
rebecca may have also given up something vital to the unsub .
thanks , garcia .
a green clothespin , 2.1 / 2 inches ,
a silver pen , 5 inches ,
and a one @-@ inch gold bullet .
9 out of 10 .
i &apos;d say you &apos;re ready .
i think it &apos;s gonna rain .
it &apos;s nighttime . how can you tell ?
you can smell it in the air .
it reminds me of when i was a little girl
sitting on the veranda with my mother watching it pour .
ah . you &apos;re the nostalgic type .
you &apos;re not ?
i am a cold pragmatist .
i should have died a long time ago .
it &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s kept me alive .
your husband is the unrelenting sort .
the world is full of different people .
to thrive , you have to accept who you are .
colin .
someone &apos;s out there .
they &apos;ve found us .
rebecca was a single woman living in a 3 @-@ bedroom house ,
yet she converted this walk @-@ in closet into another bedroom .
well , jj was right .
she &apos;s most likely a community angel .
a woman on the run would want to stay as hidden as possible .
an interior room like this would make someone feel safe ,
so they stayed here until what ?
huh . probably until they had a new identity .
look . they changed their appearance here .
so , where was the next stop ?
so i followed up with some of the other social workers
at the women &apos;s shelter , and it turns out that rebecca schroeder
was in fact a community angel .
she helped out 3 battered women in the last 6 months .
garcia &apos;s looking in on names .
oh , look at that . speak of the devil .
hey . talk to me , baby girl .
i &apos;ve been reading these heinous things
that have happened to these women at the hands of their abusers ,
and can i just say , thank god for men like you
who are strong , yet gentle at the same time--
ok . guess what . i &apos;m about to put you on speaker .
maybe you want to stick to the facts .
right . the facts . ok .
of the 3 women that rebecca schroeder helped ,
one has a boyfriend
who is serving time in jail for drug possession .
one of them has an ex
who has been working on an oil rig for the last month .
but the third woman has a husband who fits our profile .
her name is maya carcani , and her husband eric ,
he &apos;s the vp of black cross .
uh , that &apos;s a private quasi @-@ military security firm ?
yeah . he &apos;s been accused of assaulting maya
on two separate occasions .
both times charges were dropped .
then 6 weeks ago eric reported maya missing .
he recanted last week when he said maya called him
from the east coast where her family lives .
so he panicked when she left ,
and then he came up with a plan to hunt her down and kill her .
and now he wants the cops off the case .
thank you .
so the neighbor described rebecca schroeder as standoffish .
the neighbor said that
she stopped by a couple times to be friendly
and rebecca never even invited her inside .
well , how could she , what with her practically hiding fugitives ?
the neighbor also said she never had any visitors
except for a speedy send courier .
she thought the two of them were sleeping together
because the courier would back the truck up to the garage
and stay for half an hour .
i think the neighbor may have just identified
the next step in the escape route .
what do we do ? where the hell is mr. doe ?
he &apos;s coming .
when ? we can &apos;t wait any longer .
we have to .
that sniper out there is so good ,
our only chance at survival is extraction .
what are our chances if he comes in here and shoots us ?
he won &apos;t come in here .
how do you know ?
i know how these guys are trained .
he &apos;ll wait for us to come out .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. carcani isn &apos;t answering .
he must still be on the helicopter .
oh . do you know where he &apos;s coming from ?
houston .
how long has he been there ?
since yesterday morning .
is mr. carcani in some sort of trouble ?
no . no .
we just want to talk to him
about some potential business for his firm .
isn &apos;t that--
eric carcani ?
fbi .
stop or i &apos;ll shoot !
eric ? eric ?
eric . where &apos;s your wife ?
where &apos;s maya ?
tell me where she is , eric .
no . no , no , no , hey ! eric , talk to me .
tell me where she is !
eric , where is she ? !
morgan .
he &apos;s dead .
son of bitch .
so the question is , why did he run ?
he didn &apos;t need to .
eric carcani &apos;s alibi totally checks out .
he was in houston at a training seminar
during the time of both shootings ,
and several witnesses verified that .
well , black cross is known to be shady .
he knew that a visit from the bureau
wasn &apos;t gonna be a good thing .
a guy who works for a paramilitary company
probably thinks he &apos;s invincible .
i don &apos;t know , he knew something about his wife .
the way he smiled at me before he died , he was smug .
it &apos;s like he was trying to say ,
you &apos;re not gonna find her in time .
he &apos;d rather die than let her live .
well , it &apos;s the classic psychology of the narcissistic abuser .
you know , we may be looking at two unsubs .
he hired someone to kill her .
he &apos;s smart enough to distance himself .
what else do we know about him , garcia ?
he grew up in albania .
he served in that country &apos;s armed forces .
he moved to the united states for school when he was 23 .
and he &apos;s worked for black cross ever since graduation .
given black cross associations ,
he had the means and access
to hundreds of contract killers .
and loyalty runs thick in those circles .
yeah , all he &apos;d have to do is make one phone call ,
but the question is , who would he farm this job out to ?
garcia , can you go through
eric carcani &apos;s emails and phone records ?
yeah , i am already on that
and i &apos;ll hunt you back when i have something .
excuse me .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
we &apos;d like to talk to you about a package you picked up
from a rebecca schroeder .
go , danny . maple street &apos;s calling . you &apos;re late for a pickup .
my office doesn &apos;t know about this .
i really need this job .
look , we &apos;re not here to get you in trouble .
we just need to know where you took maya carcani .
i don &apos;t know their names . i &apos;m just a driver .
this is maya . do you remember her ?
ok . yeah .
yeah , she was terrified .
i took her here .
thank you .
thanks , blake . yes .
we &apos;re closer to the address . we can be there in about 10 .
garcia &apos;s sending a schematic of maya &apos;s apartment building .
good .
if the unsub has her address ,
while wouldn &apos;t he just bust down her door and shoot her ?
because he &apos;s a sniper , and that means
a comfortable kill zone for him includes distance .
he &apos;ll want to make her death look like a random attack ,
so he &apos;ll make sure there &apos;s other victims as well .
wait a minute . so anybody
in the vicinity of this apartment building &apos;s in danger ?
yes .
i made a terrible mistake , didn &apos;t i ?
oh , god , i can &apos;t breathe .
yes .
i understand .
mr. doe is here .
go out front .
he &apos;ll meet you in a blue sedan .
what about you ?
someone has to distract the sniper .
it &apos;s the only way .
but we could --
i &apos;m a pragmatist , remember ?
living on borrowed time .
now go .
we have to hope maya follows the rules .
the shelter says the women are supposed to remain in hiding
for at least two months .
they &apos;re supposed to stay behind closed windows , closed doors ,
volunteers bring supplies and food to them .
maya left her husband 6 weeks ago ,
so the killer &apos;s gotta wait another two weeks for her to come out .
there &apos;s a good chance he &apos;ll give up . he can &apos;t wait forever .
a sniper can wait up to 72 hours without sleeping .
seriously ?
that &apos;s part of their training .
they can stay awake for 72 hours
and remain completely focused on their target .
how ?
by using a mental exercise called fantasy integration .
the sniper creates a scenario involving a target
that keeps that person at the forefront of their mind .
often they &apos;ll imagine a place where they &apos;re with the target
doing something together that takes time ,
for example , building a car .
for some , the fantasy begins the minute
they &apos;re assigned a target .
and nothing will distract them .
so as long as she stays inside , she should be safe . right ?
the problem is , staying cooped up for a couple of months
without a breath of fresh air is hard to do .
it &apos;s what the sniper is counting on ,
that she has no idea he &apos;s waiting for her .
i have the name of your shooter .
maya &apos;s husband eric made a call a month ago
to a colin bramwell in mombasa .
eric and colin worked there 5 years ago .
colin is a former sniper for the south african special forces .
he was kicked out when he was suspected
of stealing government documents .
and he entered the united states a week ago on a tourist visa .
if all went according to plan ,
he &apos;s be out of the country before anyone was onto him .
and the whole thing would go down
as an unsolved act of domestic terrorism .
we &apos;re here .
she &apos;s right here .
third floor .
the only clear shot &apos;s from up there .
he &apos;s in there .
but it was all worth it , wasn &apos;t it ,
for a chance at real happiness ?
it &apos;s not for me to say .
&quot; our most basic common link
is that we all inhabit this planet .
we all breathe the same air .
we all cherish our children &apos;s future .
and we are all mortal . &quot;
