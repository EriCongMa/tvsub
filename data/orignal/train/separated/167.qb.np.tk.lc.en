gossip girl here--your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i fired andrew tyler , that private investigator .
thank you , but i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s enough .
where &apos;s bart ?
i &apos;m leaving him . i &apos;m doing it for me . i don &apos;t expect anything .
lily &apos;s at the ball with rufus humphrey .
you should figure something out and get down here now .
i wouldn &apos;t change us ,
not if it meant losing what we have .
and what do we have , chuck ? you tell me .
it was meaningful with you .
it--it was the greatest night of my life .
mine , too .
serena , where &apos;s charles ?
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
bart &apos;s been in an accident .

第二季 第十三集
more towers than trump ,
more bucks than bloomberg ...
bart bass definitely made his mark on manhattan .
the passing of a public figure can shake a whole town ,
but the real story is always the one happening in private ,
away from the headlines ,
at home .
ah . come . eat . you need your strength .
i &apos;m not hungry .
i &apos;m saving room for later .
in times of great uncertainty , it &apos;s even more important
that we continue our daily rituals .
you haven &apos;t eaten a cheerio since you &apos;ve been here .
and we--we know that &apos;s gin in your coffee cup .
my point exactly .
life must go on as it always has .
come on .
how &apos;s mom ?
i took her some coffee and some toast .
she didn &apos;t sleep very much last night .
or any night since it happened .
all she does is make lists and yell at people .
people mourn in their own ways .
what happens tonight when it &apos;s all over
and there &apos;s nothing left for her to do ?
maybe she &apos;ll move into the palace
and hole up with chuck .
ah , yes , the bottomless minibar
and the comfort of the twins in room service .
it &apos;s scandal .
people mourn in their own ways , mother .
i &apos;ve been assured by the hotel
that if chuck isn &apos;t alive and well ...
well ... at least he &apos;s alive .
oh . that &apos;s a nice picture .
remind me to send a thank @-@ you note to the photo editor .
is that tuna ?
grandma , please talk to her .
w @-@ we &apos;re--we &apos;re doing comfort food .
nobody &apos;s comforted by a tuna tower .
fine .
darling , where are you going ?
oh , out , uh , for a walk to the park .
well , is that wise ?
well , it &apos;s really hot in here with the cooking
and the ... cooking .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll be-- i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , that &apos;s a good picture .
lily should send a thank @-@ you note to the photo editor .
how is , uh , charles holding up ?
who knows ? he hasn &apos;t returned any of my calls or texts .
but the hotel says they keep sending up food ,
so there &apos;s something alive in that room .
oh , you should try some capers with that
and just a tickle of the sliced onion .
maybe i &apos;m underestimating his emotional bond
with kim and kristi from room service ,
but i just think that at a time like this ,
he should be with someone who cares about him .
not enough . not enough .
that is exactly why we are getting married ,
so that we can always be around to care for each other .
that &apos;s true .
it is .
just delivered , ma &apos;am , for your trip to paris .
christmas in paris .
how can you even think of your vacation
the day that we &apos;re putting bart in the ground ?
because , my dear , in the midst of death , we are in life .
genius .
maybe nate &apos;s heard from chuck .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you .
i know . i was just coming to check in on you
see how you were .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just worried about my mom and eric ...
and chuck .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s nice .
i &apos;m worried about you .
thank you so much for being such a rock
these past few days .
it &apos;s meant so much having you around ,
yeah , well , it &apos;s not a problem .
it just--it feels natural .
it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
hey , serena .
aaron , hey .
dan .
hey , aaron .
uh , i @-@ i just wanted to check in , see how you were .
oh , yeah . i &apos;m--i was just telling dan . i &apos;m fine .
but it @-@ it &apos;s good to see you a @-@ and you .
but , um , i &apos;m actually gonna go to the church
with just my family , so i &apos;ll see you both there ?
yeah , sure . sounds good .
yeah . that &apos;s great . see you there .
okay then . bye .
bye .
i &apos;m sorry we haven &apos;t spoken since the ball .
i really appreciate your messages .
all i want to say is that i &apos;m here .
if you want me to keep my distance , i can do that , too .
i , um , can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
well , actually , you can better than anyone else can .
everyone &apos;s so concerned about the grieving widow ,
but as much as i feel shock and loss ,
mostly i feel guilt .
i &apos;m sure you must be thinking a hundred thoughts right now ,
but , lily , you cannot blame yourself .
why not ? he was on his way to see me .
i was ...
i was gonna end our marriage .
hey ...
it &apos;s okay .
you hear me ?
um , he left me a voice mail .
oh . what &apos;d it say ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t listened to it .
i &apos;ve been too afraid , you know , to hear his voice .
well , do you want to listen to it right now ?
i &apos;ll stay with you .
thank you , but i &apos;ll do it myself . i have to get back .
lil , i &apos;m waiting for you this time .
six months ,
six years , i &apos;ll be here .
blair
call ignore
my condolences .
skip the sympathy . this is business .
my father met with you right before he died .
i want to know what you told him that night .
i worked for mr. bass , not you ,
and what i have--you &apos;re not the only party interested .
i &apos;m about to become very rich .
yeah , congrats .
but there &apos;s someone else
who &apos;s about to come into some money ,
and i think she might be more motivated than you are .
lily ? that bitch is the reason my father is dead .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
you can buy me a drink .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t stay .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
i have to go bury my father .
they say that when someone dies ,
their secrets are buried with them ,
but on the upper east side ,
sometimes the dead still speak .
you have one unheard message .
lily , we need to talk ,
and not about how my wife is making a fool of me
with her old lover .
i know the real reason you were in that hospital in france .
message deleted .
almost there.cu soon .
that was serena . she &apos;ll be here soon .
yeah , i got that .
well , i got it first .
yeah , well , it &apos;s probably my service .
4 @-@ 0 @-@ 1 area code .
yeah , that &apos;s probably it .
hey , jen .
hey . i just talked to eric .
uh , he said they &apos;re almost here .
that &apos;s old news .
hey .
hey , eric .
come here .
i &apos;m gonna go pay my respects to your mom .
thank you . she &apos;ll really appreciate that .
how you holding up ?
holding .
have you seen jonathan ?
no . why ? are you guys back together ?
no . no , i ...
just thought he might want to be here .
yeah , that &apos;ll be fine . thank you .
i see daniel and his sister are here .
will their father be making an appearance today as well ?
ugh . why on earth would you ask that ?
i followed you to the park today .
of course you did , mother .
we &apos;ll talk later .
where is charles ?
we should have just driven him to the door
and dropped him off on the steps .
no one should see him like this . he needs to walk it off .
okay , walk , chuck . bend knee , lift foot .
maybe we should have just left him at the palace .
it &apos;s his father &apos;s funeral . he needs to be here .
it shows respect .
respect ?
my father wasn &apos;t showing much of that in his final days .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
who knows ? when we found him ,
his shoes were on the wrong feet .
chuck , remember how in the eighth grade ,
you used to help yourself to the decanter
in the captain &apos;s library ?
where i first got my taste for single malt .
that &apos;s right . and you &apos;d have to go home to a 4 @-@ course dinner
without passing out in your consomm ?
i didn &apos;t want my father to think less of me .
what does that matter now ? - chuck
am i gonna have to stick my finger down
your throat ? nate &apos;ll hold back your hair .
what ?
no , no . sorry , blair . you had me and then you lost me .
just straighten his tie .
thank you , dan , for being here for serena
and for our whole family .
of course . i @-@ i can &apos;t imagine it any other way .
you are a true gentleman . your father raised you kids right .
thank you .
dear , they want to know about the wreaths ,
whether we should ...
hey !
what the hell are you doing here ? !
excuse me ?
he &apos;s just upset and loaded .
what are you doing at my father &apos;s funeral ?
you think he &apos;d want you here ?
chuck , if this is about the article ,
you know i didn &apos;t write it .
do you think i care about your failed attempt
at investigative journalism ?
my father is dead because of your father .
what , chuck ? look , i &apos;m sorry about this ...
chuck , dan has been helping us , unlike you .
helping us ? do you have any idea what his family has done ?
daniel , i think maybe it would be best if you left .
no , grandma . that doesn &apos;t make sense . it &apos;s not fair .
chuck is bart &apos;s son . he doesn &apos;t have to make sense today .
it &apos;s okay . i @-@ i understand .
you have no idea .
dan , i want you here .
serena , it &apos;s okay . let him go .
* the little things that i can do *
* that i can do
* that i can do
i know you &apos;re upset ,
but we all really need each other right now .
don &apos;t touch me , whore .
charles , please .
you need to be with your family .
my family ?
i don &apos;t have a family .
if the lord is our shepherd ,
it looks like one of his lambs has lost his way
or maybe make that a black sheep .
we bring nothing into the world
and we leave nothing behind ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t leave
a big ole mess when we go .
* every time you walk away
* or run away , you take a piece of me with you there *
* nothing feels right when i &apos;m left here on my own *
you &apos;re back soon . i wouldn &apos;t have thought bart bass
would be one to have a short funeral .
chuck threw me out before it even started ,
cause according to him , uh , my ...
my father &quot; killed &quot; his father .
what ?
why would he say that ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know , dad .
i mean , do you--do you have
any wild guesses , any thoughts ?
who knows ?
the kid &apos;s dad just died . he &apos;s upset .
yeah , that &apos;s what-- that &apos;s what cece said .
cece &apos;s in town ? that &apos;s nice for lily , to have her mom here .
that &apos;s right . i always forget that you guys know each other .
did you , uh , did you think of going today ?
to the funeral ? nah .
why not ? i mean , you &apos;re one of lily &apos;s oldest friends .
no , i know . it &apos;s just better this way .
so how &apos;s serena ?
um , that , uh ,
that would be a question for her boyfriend aaron .
you two have been spending a lot of time together
since the accident .
so ?
so like it or not , death changes things . it clarifies them .
it brings some people closer together , pushes others ...
further apart . i just thought maybe--
no , we &apos;re just-- we &apos;re friends .
oh , wow . good .
good ? w @-@ why is that good ?
or bad .
i don &apos;t know . do you want to be more than friends ?
no . we broke up twice , and it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s very much over .
you don &apos;t have to stay that long .
just let people shake your hand , say hello , you &apos;re done .
you don &apos;t have to convince me .
oh , good . well , i just thought that after what happened
at the church , you might not want to be here .
this is exactly where i want to be .
i have business to attend to .
okay , that &apos;s fine , but let &apos;s just find you a quiet corner ,
get some food in your stomach .
i &apos;m not in the mood for food .
you &apos;re really sweet with him .
me ? sweet ? no .
no , you are . i mean , worrying about him , offering him food .
it &apos;s downright maternal .
i &apos;m not maternal .
i &apos;ve just been spending too much time with cyrus ,
and i &apos;m turning jewish . come on . i see kugel .
i found that sermon surprisingly thought @-@ provoking--
all that stuff about life and death
and our time on earth being so fleeting .
darling , it &apos;s a funeral .
what was he supposed to talk about ,
the stock market ?
what &apos;s the best pizza in town ?
although , that is quite good .
no , i know , but i want to get married .
i know . so do i .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re engaged .
no , but i mean now . tomorrow .
tomorrow ?
we cannot get married tomorrow .
no , you can &apos;t .
why not ? life is so short .
it &apos;s all uncertain .
i don &apos;t want to live another day
without being your husband .
what do you say ?
she says that &apos;s crazy .
it is . it &apos;s crazy .
well , we &apos;ll do it at the apartment ,
just the family .
simple , elegant , fast .
well , it is kind of romantic .
mother .
i thought you were supportive of this union .
i am , as something that happens in a vague , far @-@ off future
that never really lands on me
because i &apos;ll be away at college ,
not as what i &apos;m doing tomorrow at 7 : 00 .
candlelight . that &apos;s perfect .
that &apos;s not what i was saying .
no . i don &apos;t have anything to wear .
well , uh , what if someone made you something ?
i mean , what &apos;d you have in mind ?
how about you minding your own business ?
i was thinking something in a jacket , very y.s.l.
okay
mick and bianca , 1971 .
great reference .
yeah , i hate to interrupt this fascinating chapter
in &quot; favorite moments in fashion history , &quot;
but
jackets are tricky .
i know . but , um , i also know someone who owes you
an all @-@ nighter , and she would be honored .
well , i think you should tell her that i said ...
thank you .
thank you for giving me a chance to make amends .
yippee !
i &apos;ll call the rabbi .
now where is-- where is aaron ?
i want to come to buenos aires with me for christmas .
what ?
that &apos;s a plane ticket .
with your name on it .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to say no , but i @-@ i @-@ i have to .
my family is a disaster .
my--my brother is lonely ,
and my mom is losing it
and chuck has publicly disowned us .
are you sure it &apos;s your family you don &apos;t want to leave ,
or is there someone else ?
dan ?
is my friend , aaron .
you--you don &apos;t have to worry .
i @-@ i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not worried .
this trip is my gift to you .
and you going with me will be your gift to me .
but i already bought you a book .
i &apos;ll read it on the plane .
just think about it .
okay .
excuse me . may i please steal my daughter for a moment ?
mother , if you want to talk , now is not the time .
what does chuck know ?
did you not hear what i just said ?
he knows something about you and rufus .
you should find out what .
mother , i just came from burying my husband .
i do not have the time ,
inclination or frankly ,
the mental capacity to go head @-@ to @-@ head with chuck .
and what he knew , he already told bart ,
so there &apos;s nothing to worry about , now is there ?
let &apos;s hope not .
but you won &apos;t know until you talk to him .
i saw him head up the stairs .
hello ?
yeah , this is she .
no , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
i &apos;m rather busy right now ,
which you would know if you read the papers .
i &apos;ll be right down .
jonathan .
you came .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
more than .
can we talk ? i have some explaining to do .
if you &apos;re looking for bart &apos;s will ,
you don &apos;t have to worry .
i &apos;m not .
but you should be .
i &apos;m going to find your file .
well , it &apos;s not here ,
so you can stop ransacking the place
and look at me .
i can &apos;t look at you , lily .
you disgust me .
charles .
disrespecting your marriage ,
betraying my father with rufus humphrey .
i did no such thing .
he was coming to fight for you .
talk about dying for nothing .
the only reason he got in that car is because you called him .
if you could have just stayed out of it ...
but you couldn &apos;t , could you ?
because you &apos;re just like him .
you have to know everything ,
control everyone , trust no one--
are you saying this is my fault ?
no , it &apos;s no one &apos;s fault .
yes , it is . it &apos;s your fault . his blood is on your hands .
i &apos;m so sorry .
as soon as that will is read
and i get my money ,
you will never see me again .
coat .
where is he going ?
chuck .
gotta go . can &apos;t talk .
go where ? everyone you know is standing in this room .
i don &apos;t want to be here .
we want you here . i just lost my stepfather .
i don &apos;t want to lose my brother , too .
when are you going to get it ?
we are not related .
hey , hey , hey . just let him go .
no !
oh , don &apos;t even try to cheer me up .
oh , i won &apos;t .
andrew tyler was just here .
bart &apos;s p.i. ? don &apos;t tell me he was here to pay his respects .
no , he wanted me to pay him .
he knows about the hospital in france .
what ?
that &apos;s why bart was coming to see me
the night of the accident . tyler told him .
well , now he &apos;s going to tell the highest bidder .
you have to stop him .
do i ? i &apos;m not sure .
you can &apos;t be serious . well , after all this time ,
now you decide that the--the right thing to do
is to tell the truth ?
the truth is out .
that changes everything , doesn &apos;t it ?
no , it doesn &apos;t have to .
there could be no better time for a clean slate .
there could be no worse time , mother .
this is the last thing i want to come out . pay him .
chuck !
stop !
don &apos;t go .
or if you have to leave , let me come with you .
i appreciate your concern .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t appreciate anything today .
but i don &apos;t care .
whatever you &apos;re going through ,
i want to be there for you .
we talked about this .
you are not my girlfriend .
but i am me ...
and you are you .
we &apos;re chuck and blair .
blair and chuck .
the worst thing you &apos;ve ever done ,
the darkest thought you &apos;ve ever had ...
i will stand by you through anything .
why would you do that ?
because i love you .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
spotted-- chuck bass fleeing his father &apos;s funeral
and blair wordorf shedding tears for the dearly departed .
you know , if you &apos;re about to apologize for chuck ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s really all right . i mean , he &apos;s upset ,
and there &apos;s bad blood . it wouldn &apos;t be entirely true to say
that i get it , but i &apos;m fine not getting it .
that &apos;s really big of you ,
but that &apos;s--that &apos;s not actually why i called .
aaron invited me to buenos aires for the holidays .
o @-@ okay . w-- well , uh , i &apos;ve never been ,
so i don &apos;t know how helpful i can be with travel tips .
i mean , i know that it &apos;s , uh , summer there , so pack a bikini .
dan . when we heard about bart &apos;s accident ,
we were in the middle of a conversation .
right . right . yeah . about what it would mean
if you--you sleeping with aaron and me sleeping with lexi ?
but that never happened , so ...
so ...
i mean , i guess now it will , right ? at least for you .
or ...
well , are--are you--are you
asking me to ask you not to go ?
no .
look , serena , if you want to go , go .
if you don &apos;t , then don &apos;t .
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t tell you who to be with .
no , but you can tell me how you feel .
how do you feel about your boyfriend
who--who wants to take you to south america ?
well , i mean , he &apos;s really great . i like him a lot .
well , that &apos;s your answer then .
you know what ? this--this muffin is apricot , i think .
yeah , it , uh , i wanted cranberry . they gave me apricot .
i gotta go back .
well ...
what do you think ?
mazel tov .
blair , i know this is all happening awfully fast for you .
i just hope you know how happy i am
just to be with your mother ,
but to have you in my family ...
i love you ...
very , very much .
i told chuck i love him .
really ? that &apos;s wonderful .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s horrible .
i thought that ...
if i could finally say it , then ...
everything would change ,
but he is just as selfish and soulless as ever .
only a masochist could ever love such a narcissist .
help me .
you don &apos;t need help .
he just needs time .
wait . not enough .
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;ll all be okay .
you &apos;ll see , dear .
well , how did it go with tyler ?
serena &apos;s at breakfast
and eric &apos;s out with jonathan .
so we can talk .
it went very well .
oh . thank you , mother .
this was the right thing . i know it was .
if you say so . but the closing of this chapter
leads us to the opening of the next one .
what are you going to do about
the fact that you &apos;re in love with rufus humphrey ?
well , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m gonna do anything ,
at least not right away .
so you are in love with him ?
i was fishing .
oh . well , you caught me .
considering the circumstances ,
i have tried with all of my strength to fight it .
it is a curse i do not wish on my worst enemy .
but i love rufus .
so that &apos;s why chuck was so upset .
serena .
let me explain
don &apos;t bother . you love rufus . you always have .
and you married bart anyway , and now he &apos;s dead .
well , i @-@ i might have ,
uh , fleshed out some of the more subtle nuances ,
but , yes , i suppose that &apos;s the gist of it .
so go ahead . how could i ? bart &apos;s body &apos;s not even cold .
whatever horrible things you &apos;re gonna say to me ,
just go ahead and say them .
i should have seen this coming .
you once asked me--
begged me-- not to be with rufus
because of you and dan .
has rufus told you he wants to be with you ?
he has .
well , this may sound strange coming from me , but ...
if you want to be with him , you should .
maybe it &apos;s your time now .
after all that you &apos;ve been through
you should at least try .
and what about you and dan ?
i &apos;m gonna try to make things work with aaron .
we &apos;re going to buenos aires for the holidays .
that is , if it &apos;s okay with my mom .
i think it &apos;s great .
hey . hey . how was breakfast with serena ?
uh , she &apos;s flying off to ...
buenos aires with aaron .
uh , well , she hasn &apos;t actually decided yet ,
but he invited her , and she &apos;s not sure , so i think
i tipped her in the direction of saying yes .
why would you do that ?
well , because she asked me not to .
and--and i realize now ,
saying it out loud , it makes no sense , but i @-@ i just--
i don &apos;t want to play some stupid game .
why not ? if you play the game , then aaron ends up
dancing the tango alone
and serena would be with you .
yeah . well , when you put it like that ...
you still have feelings for her , right ?
okay , so do you think you could put them into words
and speak to her out loud ?
yeah.yeah , if she doesn &apos;t leave first .
she &apos;s gonna be at eleanor &apos;s wedding .
you can carry the garment bag .
hey . where you guys going ?
oh , eleanor &apos;s . and no , we can &apos;t stop to talk . we &apos;re late .
you &apos;re going , too ?
yeah , um , i gotta--i gotta carry the garment bag .
hey . where are , um , jenny and dan spending christmas ?
with alison in hudson .
come away with me .
let &apos;s take that trip we didn &apos;t take last year ,
figure things out . i don &apos;t want to wait six years .
i don &apos;t want to wait at all . tonight ?
i &apos;ll make a reservation at that bed and breakfast in cornwall ,
and it &apos;ll be gray and freezing , but i don &apos;t care .
we &apos;re gonna be okay this time , lil .
i know we will .
congratulations . you &apos;re the high bidder .
the only bidder , actually .
well , if lily didn &apos;t spend every dollar she has ,
maybe it &apos;s not worth it .
i was dealing with her mother .
she said lily wanted to stop hiding her past , come clean .
tell me what &apos;s the point in me paying to know something
if she &apos;s going to tell everyone anyway ?
maybe there is none .
but you &apos;re about to become the richest kid in new york .
if i were you ,
i &apos;d want to make that decision myself .
it &apos;s a pleasure doing business with you .
oh , it &apos;s beautiful .
and so are you .
you know what could make this moment even better ?
if i told you i was going with you to buenos aires ?
well , i am . i talked to my mom and everything .
hi . um , is eleanor freaking ? i have her jacket .
is that jenny humphrey ?
where are my clothes ?
yeah , she &apos;s freaking .
oh , dan , do you mind , um , waiting here for me ?
no , not at all .
uh , i &apos;m coming .
i carried the garment bag .
i &apos;m gonna go check on my dad .
okay . i &apos;ll see you later . mm .
serena .
dan , why are you really here ?
i don &apos;t want you to go with him .
well , you &apos;re too late . i already told him i would .
tell him you &apos;re not .
dan , it &apos;s not our time .
so what ? it &apos;s you and aaron &apos;s time ?
you guys have a time now ?
it &apos;s not about aaron . it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s about our parents .
what about our parents ?
they &apos;re in love .
they--they never stopped being in love .
oh . well , that explains a lot .
i already asked my mom not to follow her heart once ,
and i just-- i &apos;m not gonna do it again .
even if i did ,
i don &apos;t think she &apos;d go along with me this time .
so you &apos;re g--you &apos;re gonna give up on all of this , on us ,
for your mom ?
we &apos;ve already tried it and failed twice .
who knows if we &apos;d work any better ?
who knows if we wouldn &apos;t ?
look , we &apos;ve both changed .
dan , we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re connected . we always will be , but ...
i &apos;m dating someone else now .
serena , we need your fashion advice .
hi , humphrey . what are you doing here ?
he--he carried the garment bag .
i did . yeah .
all right . come on , s .
i @-@ i should go .
we &apos;ll talk after the holidays .
i just can &apos;t believe ...
you &apos;d want this to become public knowledge .
what is that ?
oh , it &apos;s exactly ... what you think it is .
but my mother
lied to you
and to mr. tyler .
judging by the look on your face ,
i &apos;m guessing it wasn &apos;t your idea to come clean .
why on earth would she do this ?
i don &apos;t know . but the next time you see her , i &apos;d ask .
but until then
i &apos;m more than happy to further her agenda .
charles , um ,
i beg you ...
please don &apos;t turn away from the people that love you .
they &apos;re the only chance any of us has .
and your father never learned that .
i hope that you do .
... wedding vows of eleanor and cyrus .
baruch atah adonai eloheinu melech ha &apos;olam .
* two ravens in the old oak tree *
* and one for you and one for me *
* and bluebells in the late december *
i , cyrus ,
take , you , eleanor ,
to be no other than yourself .
i give you my love .
i am my beloved &apos;s , and my beloved is mine .
* i could sleep forever these days *
* because in my dreams ...
ani l &apos;dodi v &apos;dodi li .

* it was so like you to visit me *
* to let me know you were okay
* it was so like you to visit me *
* always worrying about someone else *
* at your funeral , i was so upset *
* so up--so upset
* in your life you were larger than this *
* statue @-@ statuesque
to the wordorf @-@ roses !

* that you &apos;re not dead , you &apos;re sleeping *
* i believe in anything
* that brings you back home to me *
this can &apos;t be good . cece .
rufus .
i &apos;m actually on my way out , if you don &apos;t mind .
there &apos;s something you need to know .
isn &apos;t there always when you &apos;re around ?
throughout my whole life ,
the only thing i have ever wanted is
my daughter &apos;s happiness .
now the means to achieving this might shift with time ,
but my goal remains the same .
uh , since this is about lily ,
she can be the one to tell me or not tell me .
i won &apos;t allow your meddling to come between us again .
i gave her a chance to tell you . she didn &apos;t take it .
in fact , she asked me to pay a lot of money
to make the problem go away .
but you didn &apos;t do that , did you ?
the real problem ...
is that she &apos;s in love with you .
why is that a problem ?
because so long as she holds on to this ,
the 2 of you don &apos;t have a chance in hell of making it work .
i want her to have that chance .
don &apos;t you ?
my girl &apos;s gonna be sporting earplugs and a neck pillow .
hey , you &apos;re gonna be fighting me for that neck pillow
when your chin is on your chest
and there &apos;s drool all over your shirt .
how did you know that i drool ?
i @-@ i think this is gonna be good--
this trip , us , all of it .
no regrets ?
none .
much better .
well , thank you for telling me
that you &apos;re in love with lily bass again
or--or still or whatever it is .
it would have been really useful information to have
before i tried to stop serena
from flying off to south america .
i will never be with lily .
i don &apos;t understand . serena just said--
serena doesn &apos;t know what the hell she &apos;s talking about .
are you okay ? what--what--
what &apos;s all this stuff and your note ?
what , are you going somewhere ?
nope .
just out .
you can answer that if you want .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want to . i &apos;m--i &apos;m here now with you .
i know you still have feelings for him .
no , i don &apos;t .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i just want you to give us time , give us a real shot ,
because i think i might be falling in love with you .
hey , it &apos;s serena . leave a message .
* standing at the punch table swallowing punch *
* &apos; cause i want to start over , i want to be winning *
* way out of sync from the beginning *
* i wanna hurry home to you
* put on a slow , dumb show for you *
* pnd crack you up
* so you can put a blue ribbon on my brain *
* god , i &apos;m very , very frightening *
* i &apos;ll overdo it
just tell me one thing .
was it a boy or a girl ?
* you know , i dreamed about you *
we hear chuck bass isn &apos;t the only one
who lost someone he loved this week .
our deepest condolences , miss wordorf .
