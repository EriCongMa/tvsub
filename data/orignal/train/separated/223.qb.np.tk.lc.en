gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
how about a tour ?
absolutely .
it is my house . don &apos;t you think you should be the one to go ?
actually , this is my house .
nice to meet you , by the way , um ...
nate .
how would you like to keep working for me ?
i would love to .
i have to say it was a pretty devious plan .
thank you , ivy . you played your part perfectly .
one month anniversary of our move .
ivy , stop talking to your boyfriend and start working .
charlie ! oh , my gosh !
what are you doing here ?
why would vanessa steal your story ?
to teach me a lesson .
people write songs about wiping out on our l.a. roadways .
i &apos;m not scared of anything .
do they know ?
know what ?
how far along you are . i &apos;d say ... six weeks ?
i &apos;m not pregnant .
lie to me all you want ,
but your body will be telling the whole world
the truth by the time of your wedding .
rise and shine , upper east siders .
it &apos;s time for your annual checkup .
lucky for you , doctors take their confidentiality seriously around here .
are you sure this doctor &apos;s reputable ?
your prenatal care is imperative .
you never care about my womb before .
maybe this is way to avoid seeing mr. louis off on trip to monaco
for feast of assumption holiday .
louis &apos; sister beatrice is
picking him up at noon in their jet , which gives us
plenty of time to discuss your gestational issues .
dorota , how are you feeling ?
she &apos;s fine . i &apos;m blair , dorota &apos;s employer .
i have a few questions .
just go with it . is only way .
i need to ask you how long her morning sickness will last .
as i &apos;m naturally empathetic ,
the mere discussion of food ...
not to mention the odor , the taste ...
it should ease off in the first trimester .
and ... what about breast sensitivity ?
miss blair !
is the one asking the questions .
you see , she practically screams when anyone touches them .
i can hear her all the way from queens .
sensitivity &apos;s totally normal .
okay . and , um , how long till she can determine the father of her child ?
she &apos;s had a few one @-@ night stands with the staff of our building .
blair cornelia waldorf !
you two should work this out .
dorota can come back another time ...
alone .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what &apos;s come over me .
yes , you do .
you are pregnant , too .
we are like sisters now !
cousins .
distant cousins .
miss blair , why you not say you are--
do not utter the word .
no one must know .
well , at least not until i have some time to figure things out .
i don &apos;t care what you say .
i hug you anyway for luck .
and keep secret .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s not you--
i &apos;m so sick of all you guys on antidepressants .
it &apos;s a good thing you don &apos;t offer satisfaction guaranteed ,
or she &apos;d be your third refund this week .
do you need pharmaceutical assistance ?
yeah , i wish weed was the answer .
i meant viagra .
no , everything works down there .
it &apos;s here that &apos;s the problem .
i just can &apos;t stop thinking about that woman from l.a.
it &apos;s understandable , given your mother issues .
she called twice .
she did ? did she leave a number
or at least her name ?
last i heard , it was anne archibald .
yeah , well , in an attempt to take some of your advice about my future ,
i asked my mom if she could help me get an internship this fall .
schumer and lloyd blankfein at goldman
are both interested , and now she wants me to choose .
so call your mommy . pick either job .
forget about your mysterious lady from l.a.
if a woman wants to see you again ,
she generally tells you her name .
what happened to the son helping the father make breakfast ?
you &apos;ve been on that computer since you got here .
i know . sorry . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m trying to figure out
which publisher has my book so i can stop it from coming out .
and jeremiah harris wasn &apos;t any help ?
no , no , the only clue i have is this , uh , check vanessa sent me .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll be one more minute ,
and then i will be in there to burn the bacon , i swear .
hey . um , listen ,
i know you &apos;re probably on your way to surf
or hanging out at cameron diaz &apos;s house , but , uh ,
i was wondering if you could share
some of your bank breaking secrets with me .
well , i thought you did all your scheming with blair .
no , she &apos;s not speaking to me .
i just need , um , to help vanessa with a bounced check ,
and i can &apos;t reach her .
i was thinking that , you know ,
whatever you did to get into lily &apos;s safe deposit box
might also work for me .
oh , well , that was all chuck .
he slept with the girl at the bank .
but knowing him ,
there are many more girls at many more banks .
you should ask him .
right . chuck . okay , thanks .
so are you really staying out there ?
well , i got a great job , and charlie &apos;s here .
char @-@ charlie as in &quot; call me serena &quot; cousin charlie
who moved back to florida ?
yeah , who &apos;s actually been living in l.a. one and the same .
i &apos;m about to go to brunch with her
and make her fill in all the blanks .
well , don &apos;t be too quick to option her life rights
before you make sure she &apos;s back on her meds .
but in all seriousness ,
tell her i said hi .
bye .
and for my final course ,
a hot peach clafouti ,
inspired by my hot girlfriend ivy .
oh , three michelin star , definitely .
which ... of these scream
&quot; i am a new york city trust fund baby &quot; more ?
uh ... those , i guess .
you okay ?
you seem extra nervous about this audition ?
yeah .
some days it &apos;s just not as much fun
trying to be an actress .
well , at least we &apos;re failing together .
unlike jason--
he just got this huge chef gig at beast in portland .
hey , it &apos;s cheap , too . moving there could end my days
of plating salad with dressing on the side
and save you from using your mysterious emergency fund .
max , i told you ,
this is my last resort .
there &apos;s only enough to use it once .
i know . it &apos;s just , i don &apos;t want to end up like everybody else
who comes to l.a. with dreams only to find that l.a.
is the place where dreams come to die .
or you get those weird lips that everybody here has .
let &apos;s not give up yet .
i promise things will get better .
i wish you could join me for the feast .
the church celebrates with all of monaco &apos;s favorite foods .
to honor virgin mother honest rise to heaven .
uh ... why aren &apos;t you waiting to greet princess beatrice
at the elevator ?
i know you two will love each other .
don &apos;t be so sure .
my first impression on grimaldi women thus far
has been abysmal at best .
unlike grimaldi men who fall in love
the moment they see you , but don &apos;t worry .
my mother and beatrice never agree on anything .
they make the brothers of brunei look civil .
at least we don &apos;t have harems .
ah , la voila .
louis ...
me , too .
beatrice , this is blair .
you are even more beautiful than the photographs
in the paper .
the perfume ...
it &apos;s jasmine and clove oil from africa .
do you like it ?
it &apos;s powerful .
then i shall give you mine .
i &apos;ll get more when i go back .
i &apos;ve always longed for a sister .
sit , sit .
tell me everything .
okay , spill . what are you doing in l.a.
and how did you get your mom to agree to let you come here ?
she didn &apos;t .
i call her and i tell her that i &apos;m okay ,
but not where i am .
trust me , it &apos;s better this way .
florida was making me crazier than new york ever did .
and you &apos;re being responsible with your medication ?
i needed a break from my mom , not reality .
well , florida &apos;s loss is my gain .
okay , i wanna know everything ! friends , boyfriends .
neither , honestly , which is why it &apos;s so sad
that you have to go back to new york for school .
well , then i must be a genie ,
&apos;cause your wish is granted .
i &apos;m staying .
i thought that your movie ended .
oh , it did , but the producer offered me a job ,
so i &apos;m meeting with her later today
to discuss the details . but don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll have plenty of time to catch up before then .
they say misery loves company , but sometimes
it &apos;s the company that makes you miserable .
mm ! my . look at the time .
i &apos;m so disappointed that i can &apos;t spend all day with you
before you rush off to your principality .
you know , blair , i feel just the same ,
which is why i moved our flight to this evening .
we now have all afternoon to share our secrets
like real sisters , and i want to know them all .
mm . i can &apos;t wait .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
but nothing &apos;s worse
than company that overstays their welcome .
good luck , b.
have fun being the hostess with the mostess .
i get working for this producer &apos;s a huge opportunity ,
but what about columbia ?
well , i &apos;m taking the semester off ,
and i &apos;ll see how things go after that .
my only issue is living with cece .
last night , at 2 : 00 a.m. , her bridge game turned brutal .
a neighbor even came and complained .
well , i &apos;m sure your real estate agent
will find you a great place .
well , hopefully near you .
in fact , why don &apos;t i have her just meet us at your place ?
it &apos;s a bad idea .
my roommate barely lets me in most days .
and he &apos;s kind of howard hughes @-@ ish .
hey , i was just about to call you .
i &apos;m gonna need to see 2 @-@ bedroom apartments instead of one .
okay , great . thank you .
no , my place is fine .
no , it &apos;s not negotiable . this is l.a.
rhodes girls have to live together .
it &apos;s tradition .
come on . let &apos;s go .
hey , chuck .
ignore him . he &apos;s not with me .
oh , hey , hey , do i need to call the cops ?
this isn &apos;t what we signed up for . we &apos;re outta here .
just ...
i expect a full refund .
what are you doing ? you okay ?
i was until you arrived .
uh , you don &apos;t--you don &apos;t look all right there .
no , no , i have the address .
i just need her name , okay ?
th @-@ then why are you called &quot; information , &quot; huh ?
i &apos;m not serena , humphrey . i didn &apos;t need saving .
hey . i thought you were still in the hamptons .
i &apos;d ask you how your summer &apos;s going ,
but seeing you with chuck ,
i guess the answer is probably &quot; weird . &quot;
oh , it gets weirder . i found him paying
some really rough dudes to-- to fight him .
he wasn &apos;t forthcoming with the details , but i--
i would imagine it &apos;s some new bass @-@ type scheme
to get blair &apos;s attention .
well , he said he was okay about her all summer .
or maybe it &apos;s finally hitting him now that we &apos;re back .
i think something else might have hit him , too .
he was already pretty bruised when i got there .
i think he might need to see a doctor .
yeah ? well , my mom has this concierge doc she could send ,
but calling her means i &apos;d have to decide
which internship i want .
well , i could stick around and talk it through with you .
i was also kinda hoping to get some help from chuck
on something anyway .
hey , i &apos;m gonna call a doctor ,
have him check out your bruises , okay ?
excellent .
listen , i &apos;ll just , uh , call you
when the doctor leaves . how about that ?
all right .
well , what do you say to a little shopping
for all your pre @-@ wedding events ?
yes . i was thinking wu for my welcome parade--
short but regal .
and alaia would put charlene and her swimmer &apos;s body
to shame at albert &apos;s ball .
hmm . those will never do .
why ? they only use children to sew the beading .
you cannot have bare shoulders , exposed knees ,
anything form @-@ fitting .
too much skin borders on bruni .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . how am i to become an icon of ...
style and taste if i can only wear a burka ?
i &apos;m sorry . the dress code is mandated .
so you get balmain ,
and i get to be barbara bush .
how is this possible ?
it &apos;s one of the many perks of being the non @-@ reigning sibling .
i &apos;m surprised to hear you say that .
i read the interview you did for &quot; the guardian &quot;
when louis gave up his seat for me ,
and you seemed more than eager to step into that role .
i admit i &apos;ve always wished for my mother
to realize she had two capable children .
but those few days
with the world watching my every move
were too much .
you , however , are much better suited
for the pressures of royal service than i.
shall we have a snack ?
ohh . actually , i need to find a restroom .
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s enough closet space .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i didn &apos;t think it was possible
for anyone to need more closets than i do .
i mean , you have a whole room for your shoes alone .
yeah . but , you know , the-- the beach traffic
can get really bad ,
and that might depress me even more
than my crazy roommate , so ...
maybe i should ... just stay where i am .
so you &apos;re gonna give this place up because of traffic ?
where in l.a. is carmeggedon not an issue ?
i already have other interest .
if you want it , you &apos;re gonna need to move quickly .
oh , i can give you a down payment right now .
except i forgot my checkbook .
but you have yours . i @-@ i saw it when your purse fell .
yeah . but , you know , i don &apos;t think i have enough
to cover two months &apos; rent .
unless you bought the maldives without telling me ,
you should have plenty .
or is this your way of telling me
that you don &apos;t wanna live with me ?
of course not .
all i have is an out @-@ of @-@ state check .
no problem . just put your local contact information
in the memo .
see ? i told you this would work out .
you understand fractured ribs
aren &apos;t something to mess around with .
you could end up puncturing a lung .
i told you , they don &apos;t hurt .
i have a hard time believing
anyone has that high a threshold for pain .
yeah , well , he &apos;s probably just self @-@ medicating .
you should see his medicine cabinet .
some of that stuff &apos;s not even legal in mexico .
no , i was just-- i was just kidding .
he claimed he couldn &apos;t feel my touching his ribs
during the exam .
if he &apos;s taking that many drugs ,
someone needs to keep an eye on him
to make sure he doesn &apos;t take any more
or do anything other than rest .
his injuries are bordering on dangerous .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
thank you .
i wish we &apos;d stopped at saint honore .
doesn &apos;t shopping leave you famished ?
well , perhaps buying one lipstick
doesn &apos;t build up the same appetite .
lucky you can eat at your feast .
i &apos;m sorry . too much coffee .
give the virgin my regards .
i &apos;ll show you to door .
and by door , i mean elevator .
over there .
i think it &apos;s fairly obvious .
our future princess has developed a drug problem .
what ? no .
uh , miss blair too much control freak
to use mind alter substance , even to help mood swing .
i admire your loyalty ,
but no one uses les toilettes so often
unless they have something to hide .
louis deserves to know what it is .
i swear , miss blair just ...
have sensitive stomach .
of course .
i knew i recognized that faint acrid smell
from boarding school .
the pale skin . not eating in public .
blair &apos;s obviously bulimic .
yes .
no . i--
i mean , not--not anymore .
only teenage habit of using restroom die hard .
but miss blair digest everything now .
i go make ... tuna melts for both of you .
louis ? we need to speak right away .
what are you doing in new york , at my house ?
leaving , by the look of it .
whoa , were you trying to find me ?
oh , this is fantastic .
i haven &apos;t been able to stop thinking about you either .
can &apos;t believe you actually tracked me down .
oh , that is borderline adorable ,
but i wasn &apos;t here to see you .
as of recently , i own &quot; the new york spectator , &quot;
and i wanted to interview your mother
for my inaugural article
on the disgraced wives of dirty businessmen ,
but she not @-@ so @-@ politely declined .
okay , wait , even if this is a coincidence ,
it &apos;s a pretty damn good one .
all right ? i was here just to discuss job offers with my mom ,
but i would much rather take you out .
oh , we had fun , nate ,
but i need more than just stamina to keep me interested .
nice seeing ya .
whoa , whoa , wait .
will you at least tell me your name ?
what &apos;s so important it couldn &apos;t wait
until our 7 @-@ hour flight tonight ?
your fiancee is bulimic .
is that all ?
bulimia is a serious disease .
blair told me all about her teenage struggles .
it &apos;s in her past .
past hour . she &apos;s not well , louis .
or she needs an escape
from a shopping trip full of rules .
she told me about that , too .
i was just trying to prepare her
for the pressures of your life .
the stress will be the worst thing
for her condition ,
all so you can claim a title we both know
you don &apos;t even care about .
you know i &apos;ll do whatever i have to
to ensure blair &apos;s well @-@ being .
but believe me , she &apos;s doing great .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
you never did understand la psychologie des femmes .
i guess i will just have to prove it to you .
go ahead .
i will prove you wrong .
hi . yes . this is charlie rhodes from earlier .
turns out that serena and i have changed our minds
about the apartment , so if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;d like to come back and get my check .
miss rhodes , your check was invalid .
the bank told me it was no good .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i gave it back to miss van der woodsen
when she brought me a new one .
maybe you should speak to her about this .
saltines only thing i eat for months with ana .
well , that was not the same .
your people are bred to work through these conditions
and give birth in a field .
no fields in krakow .
and i have birthing suite at lenox hill .
well , i am too exhausted
to even reprimand your insubordination .
at least she and prince louis gone .
you have time to figure out--
don &apos;t even let the word leave your lips .
you never know who could be lurking .
blair ?
louis .
darling .
ah , i was just about to take a nap
because i was so exhausted from that shopping trip .
so romantic of you to come and say a final good @-@ bye .
beatrice didn &apos;t want you
to miss your first monegasque holiday .
and that is so kind .
i &apos;m sure the virgin will understand
that i &apos;m too busy to be away .
which is why i had our priest arrange to celebrate here
in new york .
he &apos;s already spoken to the local church .
i hope you &apos;re hungry .
it &apos;s called the feast for a very good reason .
let &apos;s hope b &apos;s first feast of assumption
doesn &apos;t end in damnation .
back again ? what don &apos;t you get ?
unlike serena ,
when i rejected you , i meant it .
nate asked me to keep an eye on you while he was out .
and while i &apos;m here , i was wondering
if you could help me with something .
the answer is no .
and what did you do when the doctor said
you &apos;re not supposed to go out ?
well , if you &apos;re willing to fight me over it ,
we could strike a deal .
well , that kinda defeats the purpose of making sure you don &apos;t get hurt .
there isn &apos;t a chance in hell you could hurt me .
chuck , i know you saw the blast
about blair and louis going to the event tonight .
it &apos;s not worth puncturing a lung to get her attention .
blair &apos;s attention is the last thing on my mind .
come on , man . you do something dangerous .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; reports it . blair comes to your rescue .
some might call that a pattern .
humphrey , you know nothing about our situation .
well , i do know that blair is over you .
you weren &apos;t even the last one to kiss her before louis .
i was .
while her lips may have brushed yours ,
the last person she was with before she left was me .
i &apos;m referring to full carnal knowledge .
a kiss is just a kiss .
that hurt ? wish i could feel it .
poor lonely boy ,
even on the outer boroughs of love .
excuse me , ma &apos;am ,
i think you were fired from this establishment .
i want to go to portland .
if this is about your audition ,
you can &apos;t let one bad experience
make you give up on your dreams .
my dreams will never come true if we stay here ,
but yours could if we leave .
i thought about it , and you were right .
let &apos;s go before we &apos;re forced to leave .
okay , if you &apos;re sure .
i &apos;ll tell the manager when she gets back from break .
hey , this is gonna be good .
i can feel it .
we &apos;ll be like bonnie and clyde .
without the killing and robbing and car chases .
i &apos;m gonna go home and pack .
okay .
i must have gained 10 pounds last year .
it &apos;s so delicious .
louis .
mon pere .
comment va tu ?
i am sorry we missed you at cap d &apos;antibes this summer .
well , your missionary work is more important .
blair , this is father cavalia ,
the man who will marry us .
bonjour .
how wonderful . well , i &apos;m so sorry
you can &apos;t be in your own church on this devout day .
perhaps if you got on the plane right now , you could make it ?
don &apos;t be silly .
this way , i have a chance
to get to know you away from all my duties .
did you enjoy a religious upbringing , miss waldorf ?
my family &apos;s of mixed faith ,
but i &apos;ve always appreciated a confessional .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna go find one right now .
as you know , the confessionnelle is not available during a celebration .
ah . genial .
have you ever tried a barbagiuan ?
mmm , my favorite .
it &apos;s filled with pumpkin and spices
and butter .
it &apos;s delicious .
et peu tard ?
et peu tard .
i can &apos;t help it . i love those .
je vous salue , marie .
surely the virgin mother can show mercy
to those on earth still suffering while she rises to heaven .
i @-@ if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i see a lost soul in need of guidance .
thank you . i will never question
the paternity of your child again .
i told you . she can &apos;t even keep down one bite of barbagiuan .
you &apos;re starting to sound like mother .
but unlike her , who doesn &apos;t care about anyone but herself ,
i &apos;m trying to save your fiancee . why aren &apos;t you ?
blair , hey , listen , i know you don &apos;t wanna see me right now ,
probably not ever ,
but i &apos;m not here to cause problems .
i can &apos;t say the same about chuck . have you seen him ?
walk with me .
well , thanks for coming back , diana payne .
ah , you found the card i left for your mother .
please tell me it was her who texted me
to come back here and not you .
oh , she &apos;s right inside .
so why are we out here ?
her text said she &apos;d relented
and agreed to talk to me
for my &quot; spectator &quot; article .
she did . there are just a few final details
that need to be worked out first .
i know . she has a concern
that i &apos;m turning the &quot; spectator &quot; into a tabloid ,
but i &apos;m very happy to give her story approval .
wait , wait , wait . what about me ?
i mean , i am the one who convinced her , after all .
i mean , don &apos;t you think
there should be some sort of , you know , finder &apos;s fee ?
are you trying to trade
my interview with your mother for sex ?
well , i would &apos;ve called it a date , but yeah , basically .
how do i know your mother &apos;s really inside ?
well , you can watch me open the door
and tell her that we &apos;ll be back in an hour .
what makes you think we need that long ?
stamina .
serena .
what are you doing here ?
i got your address off the check
that the realtor gave me .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
was a flake and forgot to look at my balance .
okay , but you can just stop . i know what really happened .
out . the princess needs privacy .
my security detail will escort any of you
who are not willing to go out on your own .
security detail ? what &apos;s going on ?
blair , i thought you were mad at me .
and you have my forgiveness
if you shut up and guard the door .
it &apos;s not like you to forgive me
or run away from a feast .
might this have something to do with you sleeping with chuck ?
how in the world did you know that ? forget it .
i don &apos;t even have time to care .
what don &apos;t you understand about &quot; guard the door &quot; ?
i can &apos;t believe that i thought you changed last year ,
and since you didn &apos;t , chuck is now going off the deep end
trying to get your attention again .
no , now that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
whatever he &apos;s doing isn &apos;t about me .
he was the one who told me to marry louis ,
and he meant it .
now you &apos;re gonna be sorry you didn &apos;t guard .
whoa , whoa , whoa . are you--are you gonna go with me in here ?
i &apos;m not sure our friendship can handle that .
&quot; friendship &quot; is a tenuous term .
now be a gentleman and ... run the water .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re gonna have to leave .
the princess is getting sick .
of course she is . i &apos;ll bring her fiance right away .
i forgive you . are you happy ?
no . i &apos;m worried .
are you bulimic again ?
no !
i was just sick of listening to your inane questions .
now i need to say a prayer for tolerance
and get out there .
eating disorders can return when people are stressed .
clearly , chuck is not the only one freaking out here .
the only thing freaking me out
is that louis &apos; sister might notice i &apos;m gone
and get suspicious .
why would you worry about her being suspicious
if you weren &apos;t bulimic ?
blair , this isn &apos;t a joke .
we are not leaving this room
until you agree to get help .
i don &apos;t need help .
i &apos;m not bulimic . i &apos;m pregnant .
while one mother &apos;s life leads her to heaven ,
another &apos;s is going straight to hell
in a moses basket .
beatrice ?
you have to understand .
it &apos;s still so early .
i didn &apos;t wanna get louis &apos; hopes up
if things weren &apos;t okay . i was gonna tell him .
what were you going to tell me ?
about her wonderful idea , louis .
i have so many .
you know , the one
about inviting the homeless into our meal .
to dine with us ?
you &apos;re too modest .
i was telling blair about our missionary work ,
and she suggested we share our meal
with those less fortunate . i think it &apos;s wonderful .
of course .
yes , not to have them eat with us
but to serve them the food ,
like in a soup kitchen , with gloves on .
it &apos;s a wonderful idea .
spotted--chuck on the wrong side of town .
looks like bassman doesn &apos;t have enough of a dark side .
he has to take a walk on one , too .
um ... i should go .
you promise you won &apos;t say anything ?
yes , but you can &apos;t hide this forever .
i think you were right about her , louis .
she &apos;ll make a perfect princess .
and ... you the perfect sister @-@ in @-@ law .
you know , i swear , i just took that checkbook
in case of an emergency .
i didn &apos;t wanna use it .
well , why not ? it belongs to you .
it does ?
yeah , your mom can &apos;t cut you off
just because you leave florida .
that &apos;s not fair . i was actually gonna call her ,
but i was waiting till you got back .
i don &apos;t wanna involve her .
i &apos;m the one who told her i wanted to make it on my own .
besides , if she knows where i am ,
then she &apos;s just gonna try to make me come back .
that &apos;s true .
but you can &apos;t live ... here .
you have to come live with me .
i &apos;d love to , but i can &apos;t afford it .
you can once grandma calls the bank and makes it impossible
for your mom to cut you off again .
i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s such a good idea .
i don &apos;t wanna make her any more mad .
well , she &apos;ll never find out . look , i explained to cece
how bad being around your mom is for you ,
and she doesn &apos;t wanna deal with carol &apos;s wrath either ,
so she won &apos;t tell .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i can &apos;t believe that you would do this for me .
you can show your gratitude by packing .
i have to go meet my boss ,
but i &apos;ll come pick you up after .
we rhodes girls need to stick together .
get him up !
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . again ?
guys , come on . you can &apos;t--
hey ! i &apos;m not part of his payment plan .
sorry . mr. bass said
nothing should stop us except his safe word .
this is serious . he could die .
&quot; though this be madness , yet there is some method in &apos;t . &quot;
guess that wasn &apos;t the safe word .
chuck . chuck , tell &apos; em to stop .
okay . fine . stop .
let &apos;s go .
&quot; stop &quot; ? really ? that &apos;s it ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to kill myself .
then what the hell were you doing ?
i was hoping it would hurt .
what , to--to dull the pain of losing blair ?
that &apos;s what you don &apos;t understand .
i feel nothing when i see her and louis
or when i jump off a building
or when i crash a motorcycle .
even you don &apos;t irritate me .
well , having these guys beat you up
is not the way to try to feel something .
you--you could have died .
is being dead that much worse
than being nothing ?
i still don &apos;t know
how you got your mother to agree
after she slammed the door in my face .
i just told her
it was her chance to tell her side of the story
and move on with her life .
and that it made her
seem classier than ruth madoff .
clever . that &apos;s all it took ?
well , i had to let her decide on my internship--
goldman or schumer .
why do either ?
well , like i said in l.a ,
i need to figure out my future ,
and , you know ,
both are great options
other people would kill for .
how about working for me instead ?
i &apos;m not a journalist .
i &apos;m not looking for you to be one .
the newspaper is just the cornerstone
of what i hope is gonna be a new media empire .
someone with your persuasive skills
could be great at sales or marketing .
once you know how to control information ,
you can do anything with it--
politics , banking , whatever .
while that sounds great ,
i would have to get my family to approve me
pulling out of this other thing .
well , just remind them what &quot; george &quot; did for j.f.k. jr .
这里一语双关 引用了内特的假名字 &quot; 乔治 &quot;
see you at the office next week .
watch out , nate .
looks like sex play may not be the only game you &apos;re a pawn in .
so it looks like something called a conversion disorder .
people become blind , paralyzed , or unable to feel
after experiencing a psychological trauma ,
i.e. blair leaving you forever .
it &apos;s a little like p.t.s.d.
if you say so .
you should see someone .
treatment involves trying to make the patient feel again .
that &apos;s what i was doing before you showed up .
well , how about instead of pain ,
you try to feel good things ?
i could tickle you .
i &apos;d rather hire someone else to do that ,
thank you , but it wouldn &apos;t work either .
why don &apos;t we discuss
why you needed my help before instead ?
um ... i wrote a novel .
it was something i was working on for a while .
no one was supposed to see it , but then vanessa found it
and sent it to a publisher ,
so i need to find out which one
so i can , uh , i can stop it from coming out .
forgive me for stating the obvious ,
but isn &apos;t being published
a writer &apos;s goal ?
not for this book .
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s a scathing social satire
about everyone i know , including you .
return of charlie trout .
hmm . i need to get into vanessa &apos;s bank account
so i can see who &apos;s making the deposits
before anyone sees what i wrote .
well , just because i can &apos;t feel anything
shouldn &apos;t mean everyone else has to endure a humiliation .
i &apos;ll help you .
so jason said we could crash with him and his roommates
until we find our own place .
max ...
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t think i can go .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;ll be great .
i even got us onion @-@ flavored snacks for the road .
and these things .
what changed ?
remember what you said .
this isn &apos;t giving up on our dreams .
it &apos;s just making them happen in a different place .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just realized that
what &apos;s making me unhappy in l.a. isn &apos;t l.a.
it &apos;s you .
where is this coming from ? i love you .
i &apos;m sorry . i wish i could explain better ,
but i can &apos;t .
just ... be happy
and ... know that i never meant to hurt you .
how well do any of us really know each other ?
even families have their secrets .
we were so close .
i could even see my mother &apos;s face
as louis gave away his title
because his fiancee was bulimic .
she would have never forgiven him .
it would have been perfect .
why not just tell her blair &apos;s pregnant ?
please . nothing would make her happier
than a grandchild by golden boy .
i just have to find another way to get louis
out of monaco for good so my mother will finally see
i was the right choice all along .
vengeance becomes you .
thank you .
so how did your crazy roommate take it ?
it wasn &apos;t easy , but he &apos;ll be fine .
well , maybe you should get further from him
than just santa monica .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s okay .
unless you found us a different apartment .
mm , how about one on the upper east side ?
what are you talking about ?
well , turns out my boss was only in l.a. for the movie .
so my meeting was about transferring her back
to her new york office , and i want you to come with me .
last time didn &apos;t work out so well .
well , this time , you won &apos;t have your mom to worry about ,
and you &apos;ll have your trust fund and your family .
cece wants us to stay with her in montecito until we leave ,
and her house is huge .
you would love it . please . all you have to do is say yes .
why not ?
i think i &apos;m done here .
they say blood is thicker than water .
but it &apos;s also a lot harder to clean up when it spills .
if i &apos;d known any better ,
i &apos;d think you &apos;re starting to like brooklyn .
it isn &apos;t brooklyn i &apos;m here for .
you &apos;re the only person i can have
a furtive , emotionally loaded conversation with right now .
how &apos;s chuck ?
uh , he &apos;s ... okay . sort of . long freudian story .
how are you ?
pregnant .
that makes it sound more real .
i had hoped denial would last longer
as a coping mechanism ,
but breast tenderness and morning sickness
made that impossible .
you know , you do have options .
and i &apos;ve considered them all ,
but no matter what , this baby was conceived out of love ,
and ... i &apos;m gonna keep it .
have you not told louis
because it might be chuck &apos;s ?
i only slept with him once .
i slept with louis a hundred times .
he may be mild @-@ mannered , but he &apos;s surprisingly virile .
so by the sheer law of probability ,
it must be his .
well , except the definition of &quot; probability &quot;
is &quot; strong likelihood &quot; not , uh , &quot; known fact &quot;
haven &apos;t you read &quot; the power of positive thinking &quot; ?
put your giant intellect aside and just focus with me
on wish fulfillment .
this is not that kind of situation .
even blair waldorf cannot bend d.n.a. to her will .
i am about to marry a fabulous man ...
who happens to be a prince .
i can &apos;t be this close to having all my dreams come true
only to have them yanked away by one transgression
at a stranger &apos;s bar mitzvah .
look , i know it &apos;s scary ,
but i think you should know who the father is ,
if not for yourself , then for the baby .
and what if i lose everything ?
you &apos;ll still have me .
maybe it &apos;s not blood bonds that make us a family .
perhaps it &apos;s the people who know our secrets
and love us anyway , so we can finally be ourselves .
