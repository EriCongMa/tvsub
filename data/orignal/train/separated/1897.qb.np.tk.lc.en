&quot; idle hands &quot;
work keeps our minds active .
it keeps us out of trouble .
13 seconds to run a low @-@ exposure , high @-@ resolution , full @-@ body
x @-@ ray .
when this e.r. reopens tomorrow ,
this thing is gonna save us time , money , and lives .
say that first part again .
what , 13 seconds for a full @-@ body x @-@ ray ?
we &apos;re gonna be able to do a complete evaluation
of , uh , g.s.w.s , stabbings , crush injuries ,
without ever having to leave this e.r.
do you like your new toy ?
yeah .
then shut up and thank me for it .
when we &apos;re not working , our hands are idle ,
and the devil will find work for idle hands to do .
need any help ?
nope .
uh , it &apos;s on . you ready ?
obviously i won &apos;t be wearing it
with a t @-@ shirt and underwear .
oh , no , no , no .
you should only wear it with a t @-@ shirt and underwear .
or nothing ...
would be even better .
okay , i have to practice walking on it for a while ...
if i want to wear it to work .
yeah , totally .
and when you have an idle mind ,
well , that &apos;s the devil &apos;s playground , too .
it was wet and cold . i got the flu .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to go again .
that was the first time i went fly @-@ fishing .
has he stopped kicking ?
for the moment .
her eyesight is developing this week .
unless it &apos;s not . unless she &apos;s blind .
she &apos;s not blind . or he &apos;s not .
or if he or she is blind , that &apos;s fine .
blind is fine .
what do we call it , &quot; it &quot; ?
one of us can say &quot; he , &quot; one of us can say &quot; she , &quot;
and we &apos;re covered .
well , no , because then it &apos;s gonna be born
thinking one of us is always wrong .
well , maybe it can &apos;t hear anyway .
maybe it &apos;s deaf .
deaf is fine .
helen keller went to harvard , meredith .
okay , well , what if it &apos;s not fine ?
what if it &apos;s absorbed twin body ?
two heads , extra arms--
stop .
i &apos;m just saying ,
if anyone &apos;s gonna have a baby with two heads and three arms
and 11 toes , it &apos;s gonna be me .
would you just go to sleep ? please .
sleep .
and we own a hospital .
yeah , we have for several weeks now .
yeah , but today it has an e.r. and , uh , coffee sleeves
with the new logo on them .
we needed the coffee sleeves , right ?
they &apos;re a good expense ?
oh , yeah , for branding . mm @-@ hmm .
we had a 17 @-@ hour meeting about it .
i love the new logo . it really catches the eye .
and , uh , these coffee sleeves-- excellent thermal retention .
what &apos;s up with the sheet ?
i thought you guys put it there for some kind of unveiling .
no .
well , somebody should say a few words , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s unlucky not to .
hey , why are you guys staring at the wall ?
oh , we &apos;re waiting for the ... big unveiling .
mm . well , you should be staring at my wife .
new haircut ?
no . it &apos;s her leg . she &apos;s weing high heels .
because she has a sexy high @-@ heel leg
that makes her ass go pow .
baby got back .
mm @-@ hmm . come on , guys .
you can comment , too . you have permission .
it &apos;s the one time in your life you can say it ... no .
and , uh , not be gross .
well , i think it &apos;s a fine gluteal--
oh , no . yeah . let &apos;s just do the unveiling .
um , guys , i think the painters actually just left that there .
let &apos;s get back to work .
end of speech .
awesome .
we are awesome . did you see our picture in this ?
ha ha ha ha ha ha .
i &apos;m at 28 weeks and i am worried about digeorge syndrom .
digeogre ? there &apos;s like , what ,
a 1 in 100,000 ?
it &apos;s too rare .
more likely it &apos;ll have a cleft palate
or a heart defect .
wait , if your baby has a heart defect ,
i will fix it .
what about phenylketonuria ?
no , we screen for that at birth and treat it with diet .
what about a giant hemangioma ?
like a huge , out @-@ of @-@ control bloodsucker ?
now that &apos;s a possibility .
or maybe a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation .
again , i will operate and do a lung transplant .
we own a hospital--
&quot; a cutting @-@ edge , research @-@ oriented hospital
with an advanced level @-@ i trauma center . &quot;
whatever &apos;s wrong with your baby , we will fix it .
but you agree , there &apos;s definitely something wrong ?
oh , my god . marcus cho ?
who &apos;s marcus cho ?
uh , uh , he &apos;s like a high @-@ functioning moron
who was a year behind me at stanford .
and he just got published with his attending for ...
no . no .
for what ?
robot @-@ assisted surgery for mitral valve regurgitation !
he looks kinda smart .
he &apos;s a moron .
i heard there was an o.b.
using forceps during a breech delivery .
pulled a little too hard and ...
pop .
now that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
we &apos;ll let these fluids go in for a few hours
and then , uh , set you up for chemo this afternoon .
who &apos;s gonna set me up , you
or dr. wilson ?
dr. wilson .
she &apos;s been begging for more time with you .
did you cry ?
i have that effect on the ladies .
i &apos;ll bet you do .
hey .
hey , sorry . you got a sec ?
yeah . uh , pablo , this is dr. myers .
hey , what &apos;s up , pablo ?
i just want to say , i have that c @-@ section in 20
if you wanted to watch , unless you &apos;re busy .
watch you actually do a real surgery ?
yeah , you can criticize my scalpel technique ,
which is awesome .
dr. karev ?
uh ... we &apos;re slow . i don &apos;t care .
whoa .
uh , this popped out .
is that bad ? sorry .
hey , don &apos;t sweat it , little man .
i &apos;m not little . i &apos;m 12 .
my growth was stunted by a lifetime of cancer .
i &apos;ll check in later .
okay ?
did you do that on purpose ?
is she going out with that nozzle ?
i hate him .
well , the guy &apos;s a doctor . you can &apos;t do that .
you know what else we should do ?
what ?
and get to know the new electronic board .
it automatically updates the location of your patients
and any labs that have been ordered .
and we now have workstations at every bed ,
which are fully integrated with the new charting system .
and the beds are now numbered differently ,
so just pay attention .
and now what you have all been waiting for ...
the lodox--
low @-@ dose radiation x @-@ ray statscanner .
it provides full @-@ body anterior and lateral views .
the low radiation makes imaging safer
for children and pregnant women .
it is our most cutting @-@ edge tool
in diagnostic technology .
murphy .
when can we use it ?
oh ! i &apos;ll volunteer .
when i was 6 , i stuck a marble up my nose ,
and it never came out .
we checked my stool for over a year .
listen , this is not a toy .
i know we all want to see this thing in action .
but be patient .
the last thing we need is some line forming
when some real trauma comes in .
chief hunt , we &apos;ve got an a.t.v. accident
two minutes out .
and here we go .
oh , dr. avery .
hey , i know you &apos;ve been thinking about
raising the profile of the hospital .
not today , dr. bailey .
today i am going to the e.r.
to find something to operate on .
well , i have a proposal
for a grey sloan human genome mapping program
that &apos;ll cost less than chicago &apos;s program .
no money . we spent it on the new e.r.
okay , if you and the other board members
would just read over the--
i am a doctor today , bailey .
hmm . okay . okay .
what have we got ?
16 @-@ year @-@ old female . a.t.v. collision .
g.c.s. is 6 .
open depressed skull fracture with active bleeding .
whoa . let &apos;s take her to lodox .
get a statscan before we take her to trauma .
they &apos;re using the lodox .
the lodox ?
oh , someone say &quot; lodox &quot; ?
got here just in time .
sweet . this is gonna be great .
all right , everyone .
let &apos;s get ready for this transfer .
all right , on my count .
hold on .
she &apos;s bleeding through these bandages .
ross , a.b.p. pads .
got it .
uh ... it looks like it &apos;s a branch of the m.c.a.
pressure &apos;s not gonna tamponade it .
we need to get her straight to the o.r.
uh , page shepherd . ross , you &apos;re on this .
she &apos;s right here .
what about the lodox ?
she needs an intraoperative c.t.
it &apos;ll only take 13 seconds .
we don &apos;t have 13 seconds to spare .
she could stroke out at any second . let &apos;s move !
let &apos;s go !
you guys want to look for my marble ?
mr. kramer .
our best neurosurgeon-- dr. shepherd--
just started operating on your daughter .
you &apos;re gonna fix her , right ?
well , she sustained a lot of damage to the brain .
since she wasn &apos;t wearing a helmet--
she was wearing a helmet .
we have been riding every weekend
since she was 13 years old .
i would never let her near a bike without one .
we--we stopped to take a picture .
she took her helmet off for a minute ,
and that idiot comes flying out of nowhere .
i swear to god , i am gonna hunt that son of a bitch down
and i am gonna crack his skull open .
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can--
so what are you standing here for ?
get in there !
dr. yang , you got a sec ?
um , i don &apos;t . i &apos;m looking for dr. russell .
well , i &apos;m looking for funding .
ugh . you &apos;re pitching me now ?
yeah . you &apos;re on the board .
and i have been postponing research
to write policy to become , like , a lawyer ,
while people like marcus cho are out there doing it .
we should be doing it .
don &apos;t you want this hospital
to be on the cutting edge of medical research ?
exactly . we &apos;re on the same page .
okay . then you &apos;ll fund my genome project .
what ? no .
i need to find some badass ,
earth @-@ shattering cardio research i can get in on .
okay--
i can &apos;t tell you how happy i am to hear that .
dr. russell , i need to be put to work .
i need to know what research projects you have pending--
great . what are you doing this afternoon ?
i think i have just the procedure for you .
i got a page .
i &apos;m sorry . do you know who needed a g.y.n. consult ?
no , i don &apos;t know .
ahh . dr. grey .
do you need a g.y.n. ?
nope .
then who paged me ?
can i help you ?
well , i noticed your patient has acute abdominal pain .
any chest pains ?
because if you wanted to put her through the lodox
for a full body scan , you could .
if you wanted ,
you know , to ... use the lodox .
do i need a full body scan ?
it only takes 13 seconds .
no , you don &apos;t .
no lodox . thank you .
so recently , the pain has been getting worse ?
i thought i had the stomach flu .
i drown myself in that sanitizer stuff ,
but when you &apos;re teaching kids ,
oh , they &apos;re just little germ bags .
ah , i &apos;ve been out for a week .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
oh , it &apos;s been great for me .
i haven &apos;t taken a day off in 28 years .
you know how many , um , cooking shows they have now ?
i don &apos;t .
it turns out , i love watching people cook things .
and then this morning , the pain was so bad ,
i couldn &apos;t move , so i @-@ i called the ambulance .
okay , madeline , so from what i &apos;m seeing here ,
it looks like gallstones .
oh , god . does that mean surgery ?
it does .
but the good news is , we can do it laparoscopically ,
which means no big incisions
and very little recovery time .
and i &apos;ll take them out , and you &apos;ll be on your way .
well , i get to watch some more people cook stuff .
okay , so i &apos;m gonna get them started on admitting you .
you just sit tight .
great . thank you .
did you just update your patient file ?
watch this .
so cool !
you do get excited about things .
yes , i do . hey , how &apos;s that baby ?
oh , it probably has three arms and a tail .
how &apos;s your paramedic boyfriend ?
terrible .
i mean , um , great .
perfect . just not--
i probably have to break up with him .
why ?
okay , are-- are you really asking ?
because i really need to talk about this .
well , now i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m asking .
okay . uh , matthew &apos;s never ...
been to the carnival .
and he thinks that i haven &apos;t either
because that &apos;s what i told him , but i have .
i &apos;m sorry .
and you want to go to the carnival together ?
because i &apos;ve been already and i ... rode the rides .
you went to the carnival with jackson .
i have ridden the rides ...
and they are good--
the tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl and then
that one that spins around
when your back is up against the wall
and then the floor falls out from underneath your feet .
and i want matthew to go with me ,
but he wants to wait ,
which is ... why he &apos;s perfect ,
because that &apos;s what i want .
i always wanted to wait , but i didn &apos;t wait .
and now i just--
every night push him closer and closer .
and i feel like i &apos;m just gonna slip
and buy him a ticket and shove him on the tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl ,
and then he &apos;s gonna love it , and i will have corrupted him .
and i @-@ i &apos;m not a corrupter .
well , i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re talking to me about this .
i am a big fan of the carnival
and i go every chance i get .
yes , i know , but--
okay , so your whole thing is ,
god has a plan , right ?
yeah .
well , there must be a reason
why god let you go to the carnival already .
maybe you &apos;re supposed to take matthew .
you &apos;re right , i should not be talking to you about this .
fancy new e.r. ,
and all i &apos;ve done is splint a pinkie ?
this is why we bought a hospital ?
uh , hey . if--if we get off ...
at a decent time , um , and we put sofia down early ,
and i could make dinner , and we could , um ...
really ?
really .
so ...
you think tonight ?
is definitely the night .
for sex , right ? we &apos;re talking about sex ?
the sexy night .
okay .
ladies , hey , just the two people i was looking for .
uh , walk away , bailey .
no , no , i need to speak to board members ,
and i remember you all giving me some kind of crap
about how the door &apos;s always open , so--
oh , but right now it &apos;s closed .
one minute .
it &apos;s the wrong minute .
are you kidding me ?
okay , what happened to the new hospital ,
run by doctors , all about doctors ?
okay , well , it-- what happened is ,
my wife &apos;s new leg is making her feel sexy .
and we haven &apos;t had sex in a long time .
i mean , we &apos;ve done stuff , don &apos;t get me wrong .
but we haven &apos;t done other stuff .
and other stuff is happening tonight .
so that &apos;s what we were talking about
when you interrupted us--
walking away .
you warned her .
i did .
uh , meredith grey ,
i want to talk to you about human genome mapping .
right now ?
yes , right now .
i &apos;m operating .
exactly . i have you cornered .
you can &apos;t walk away
or start talking about the sexual antics
you &apos;re going to engage in tonight .
but you can listen .
bailey .
now !
genetic mapping can lead us to developing
targeted therapies for diseases .
oh , no .
oh , yes , precision medicine ,
where we treat illness at its molecular source
instead of just dealing with the consequences .
what &apos;s this ?
what it is is the future of medicine .
it &apos;s a way that we--
no , bailey . shut up .
please . you &apos;re removing a gallstone .
you can do that in your sleep .
no , it &apos;s not gallstones .
oh . it &apos;s calcified .
okay , well , you &apos;ll need to do a biopsy
and maybe open her up .
but don &apos;t think the worst .
this is a hard mass .
this is cancer .
oh , crap . it &apos;s spread to the liver .
oh , if she was teaching until last week ,
it can &apos;t be that bad .
all right , if we resect part of the liver
maybe we can get it all .
it &apos;s worth a try .
oh , look at that .
it &apos;s encasing the hepatic artery and the bile duct .
we could continue ,
but we can &apos;t take the artery .
it &apos;s unresectable .
well , let &apos;s finish up and close .
you have to take that much off ?
i need the exposure .
oh , there &apos;s more damage than we could see on the c.t.
it &apos;s been a few hours .
i &apos;d really like to get an update to the father .
okay , but just so you know , he &apos;s kind of a big , angry maniac .
oh , you can handle it .
of course .
i &apos;ll just make sure security &apos;s close by .
look , ross , this is an arena in which i know you excel .
just start with the positive news ,
be confident ,
and don &apos;t make any promises you can &apos;t keep .
you &apos;re my voice out there .
i &apos;ll channel you . it &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m derek shepherd .
it &apos;s a beautiful day to save lives .
i &apos;ll channel you in my own voice .
thank you .
this is the lotus valve .
we &apos;re doing a lotus valve .
this is the lotus valve .
50 % of people with aortic valve defects
don &apos;t survive a year after diagnosis .
but the lotus valve is noninvasive .
it minimizes aortic regurge , doesn &apos;t need , uh , balloon inflation
or rapid pacing of the heart ,
so less stress on the body , less blood loss , less--
well , you &apos;re obviously up to speed .
i &apos;ve been dying to get in on this
ever since you started testing .
outstanding .
the results of phase two have been amazing .
phase three should be a hoot .
god , you can retract and resheath before you deploy .
exactly . that &apos;s the best thing about it .
you have total control over the entire procedure .
it &apos;s incredibly flexible
if you don &apos;t get it right the first time .
but i imagine you will .
m @-@ me ?
i wondered if you might like to try your hand at placing the valve .
oh , my god . yes .
thank you , sir .
dr. jason myers to the e.r.
dr. jason myers to the e.r.
nobody &apos;s tried it yet ?
no , not yet .
that is sad . this is a beautiful machine .
it is sad .
it &apos;s like a carnival ride with all the lights turned off ,
just sitting there going to waste .
it would be so fun--
and it cost us a lot of money
just to be pretty .
oh , why would god present us with this gorgeous thing ,
just put it right in front of us ,
and then want us not to use it ?
i ... don &apos;t think god was involved .
the board paid for it , so--
and we definitely want it to get used .
okay , one of you two paged me , right ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
nope .
he went to the e.r.
then ortho , then back to the e.r. ,
and then he went to the cafeteria .
the cafeteria ? what a tool .
yeah . dr. jason myers to proctology .
oh , wait . listen .
dr. jason myers to proctology .
all right .
well , that was fun , but i have
actual doctor work to do .
damn .
i got a great idea for the next one .
come on .
but if you want to deny my dying cancer wish ...
so i @-@ i &apos;m gonna die from this ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
there is no cure
for nonresectable late @-@ stage gallbladder cancer .
chemo may give you more time ,
but it has not been shown to provide a cure .
i &apos;m sorry .
ms. skurski ?
you guys , what are-- what are you doing here ?
mr. arnold said you were in the hospital .
dr. grey , these are some of my students ,
who are supposed to be at their after @-@ school study session now
with their substitute .
what are you doing here ?
mr. arnold sucks .
lucas , we don &apos;t say &quot; sucks . &quot;
sorry . he &apos;s just a jerk .
he sends , like , five people a day to the principal &apos;s office .
and we never get free time ,
even after we finish our homework .
and his breath smells really bad .
you &apos;re coming back soon , right ?
of course .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;ll be good as new really soon .
isn &apos;t that right , dr. grey ?
yes .
yes , that &apos;s right .
the good news is her vitals have been stable .
but her injuries are extensive .
we &apos;ll be operating for several more hours .
wait . wait . what does that mean , extensive ?
uh , it &apos;s hard to say .
susie &apos;s suffered damage to the parts of her brain
that control speech , motor functions--
she &apos;s paralyzed ?
my--my little girl is paralyzed ?
no , no , i mean ,
paralysis is a possibility ,
but we can &apos;t tell what kind of deficits she &apos;ll have until she wakes--
what kind of things are you expecting ? how bad ?
there might not be any .
which one is it , are there or aren &apos;t there ?
at this time , it &apos;s too early--
you said she might not be able to speak .
we don &apos;t know--
what the hell do you know ?
i know this must be scary for you--
damn right ,
because you don &apos;t know anything .
don &apos;t talk to me
till you know what &apos;s going on ,
or get me someone who does !
i know i shouldn &apos;t have lied right in my kids &apos; faces .
i kinda pride myself on not doing that .
i just couldn &apos;t tell them . i just couldn &apos;t .
maybe ...
there &apos;s a way to help prepare them .
maybe it would make you feel better .
i teach them science and math .
i teach them things that make sense ,
and this doesn &apos;t make sense .
i @-@ i ...
yesterday , i was ... watching tv .
i was happy
to have a little break from school ,
and today , i ...
i &apos;m probably not even gonna make it to finals .
their parents will have to tell them .
i ... i ... or mr. arnold .
i @-@ i just don &apos;t know what i would say .
this sucks !
we don &apos;t say &quot; sucks , &quot;
but this sucks .
i only have a dog bite and two patients with the flu .
i have a sprained ankle .
yeah , let &apos;s do that . get him in the machine .
he doesn &apos;t need a full body scan .
it &apos;s a really bad sprain .
i have a stomachache .
stomachache could be a tumor , kidney stones .
no , i have a stomachache .
we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on that thing ,
and it &apos;s just sitting there .
okay , how bad is the sprain ?
what ?
that ass does not quit .
these heels are killing me .
what was i thinking ?
i mean , heels were a pain even before i had a plastic leg .
why &apos;d i think it &apos;d be better now ?
can i take a look ?
nope .
oh , well , i just might be able to help .
mm . you &apos;re not my doctor . you &apos;re my wife .
here we go .
what ?
uh , we &apos;re not gonna have sex tonight .
wh--i--who said--
who said that we &apos;re not gonna have sex tonight ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying .
you just told me your leg hurts ,
so that tonight when i put on
my drop @-@ dead gorgeous underwear ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me to change into my sweats .
and then when i look disappointed ,
you &apos;re gonna say , &quot; please don &apos;t make that face , callie .
you know that my leg &apos;s been bothering me today . &quot;
and ...
what kind of manipulative bitch do you think i am ?
you &apos;re not manipulative and you &apos;re not a bitch .
okay ? i &apos;m a bitch . yeah .
you are uncomfortable like you have been
for a very long time now ,
and if i were a really good person ,
i would continue to be patient ,
but apparently , i &apos;m not .
a g.y.n. patient just came in .
this time i have a name . talia .
if you can find her , you can treat her .
i &apos;m looking for a ms. talia .
a jenny talia .
i &apos;m here to see jenny talia .
oh , you have got to be kidding me .
karev .
a moment .
what the hell are you doing ?
dr. webber , i was--
out of all the childish ,
sophomoric things to do to someone ,
this may be the most pathetic .
come on . look at the kid .
he lives in this hospital . he never gets to have any fun .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
the big deal is , i thought you were better than this .
jenny talia ?
you need to up your game .
you &apos;re cutting right into her frontal lobe .
calm down , ross .
her whole personality could be affected .
her memory could be gone ,
and that man out there is gonna kill me .
did i ever tell you the first time i went fly @-@ fishing ?
no .
yeah , i went out to the hoh river to fish winter steelhead .
for hours , i tried to cast like i &apos;d practiced .
but if you over try , it &apos;ll never happen .
and then just once ,
the rod loaded perfectly .
the line formed a tight loop ,
and the fly just danced out over the river about 70 feet .
it had a life of its own .
see , the key was to relax ,
feel the rhythm , and let the rod do the work .
just one perfect cast .
why &apos;d you tell me that ?
did it calm you down ?
yeah .
mm @-@ hmm .
right now i am about to remove a hematoma
from broca &apos;s area .
and if i am not careful , she &apos;ll never speak again .
there is a lot to be afraid of .
patients will be afraid . parents will be afraid .
and the only way to get through it
is for you to stay calm .
the brain is swelling .
what are we gonna do about that ?
we &apos;re gonna ...
we &apos;re gonna give her more mannitol .
good .
that was amazing .
the valve started operating before i fully released it .
incredible , right ?
and almost no paravalvular leakage ?
revolutionary technology ,
and the rate of success with phase two
has been astounding .
well , when do we start phase three ?
well , that &apos;s up to you , really .
up to me ?
you &apos;re--you &apos;re giving phase three to me ?
no . no .
it &apos;s my trial .
i don &apos;t need another surgeon .
what i need from you is $ 12 million
so i can keep it going , for patient recruitment ,
research staff , lab space .
i want to make grey @-@ sloan the premier destination
for this procedure .
i thought you were bringing me on to this .
you &apos;re-- you &apos;re pitching me .
it &apos;s nice to finally have someone on the board
who gets what i &apos;m doing .
this is exactly what i was afraid of .
the administrative crap is taking over my career .
russell called me &quot; someone on the board . &quot;
i mean , he doesn &apos;t even see me as a surgeon .
i &apos;m just someone who cuts budgets .
ugh . stop kicking in there .
i mean , what are you , choking on your cord or something ?
cristina , please talk to it .
he or she .
who ?
the baby .
no .
the sound of my voice only makes it kick harder .
for some reason , derek can calm it down .
maybe you can , too .
you know , i &apos;ll talk to it when i see it .
when she gets her first period .
i &apos;ll take that off your plate .
or if it has a penis ,
i &apos;ll tell him not to think with it .
ow . cristina , please just talk to it .
hello .
this is ... cristina ...
yang .
i don &apos;t know . what do you want me to say ?
anything . just talk .
oh , get up .
hey , uh , this is miranda bailey .
i am an excellent surgeon and a forward thinker .
your mother &apos;s a surgeon . your father is a surgeon .
you &apos;ll very likely want to be one , too .
but i &apos;m hoping by the time it &apos;s your turn ,
there will be very little surgery left
because human genome mapping
will have given people information
so that they can fight their diseases before they happen .
keep talking . it &apos;s working .
um , armed with information ,
people will be able to live longer , healthier lives .
now i know this is a very expensive undertaking ,
but maybe if you hadn &apos;t spent so much money
on coffee sleeves and new logos ,
there &apos;d be money in the budget
to fund a forward thinker like me .
i think she &apos;s talking to us now .
look , here is my proposal ,
which i &apos;ve made to you
because you &apos;re in charge .
which is messed up , but i &apos;m not gonna go there
because i want your money .
we are in charge .
i am in charge .
i am gonna crush marcus cho
because i am in charge .
wait . don &apos;t leave . i--
hey , cristina , please talk to it .
ow .
okay , right .
o @-@ okay .
that was the ambulance from earlier .
they thought they left one of their backboards here .
they found it .
all right . brooks .
whoa . what are you doing ?
hop in .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
let &apos;s find that marble , and the rest of you ,
line up and watch .
at the very least , we &apos;re going to figure out
how to run this damn thing .
chief , we got a motorcycle accident coming in .
extensive crush injuries .
hop out .
but it only takes 13 seconds .
out now . and the rest of you , let &apos;s prep for incoming .
is that a specimen cup ?
did you place a warm cup of pee next to me ?
it &apos;s my urine sample .
what , should i go put it on your desk ?
if you want to die .
but the memo says that you &apos;re in charge
of the random drug test policy .
okay , whatever drugs you are doing , stop !
what was that about ?
uh , that &apos;s what happens when the hospital &apos;s slow .
the doctors start punking each other .
oh . well , i just wanted to let you know
that we found funding for your project .
oh , i get it .
you popular kids are punking me ,
like this is some high school volleyball team .
well , i do not want to play varsity that bad , kimberly .
bailey , you get your genome lab , for real .
yeah , right .
yeah , cristina just assembled a quick board meeting .
now we haven &apos;t dotted all the i &apos;s or crossed all the t &apos;s yet ,
but it looks like you &apos;re gonna get your funding .
but avery said there wasn &apos;t any more money .
yeah , well , one of the other departments cut their budget .
you &apos;re cutting my budget ?
just by a couple million .
i asked you for more money , not less .
i &apos;ll have to lose a resident , a @-@ a research assistant--
probably two ...
of each . sorry .
wait . wait .
what does that leave me with ?
it leaves you with me .
to do the work of four people ?
i am the best four people
you will ever have working for you .
i will treat your patients , take your surgeries ,
and assist in research ,
including projects i find on my own .
feel free to pile it on .
but i can &apos;t possibly--
oh , the board believes you can .
i told bailey she &apos;s getting her genome lab .
she was so happy . she looked great .
that &apos;s fantastic .
hey , are you okay ?
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m really happy for bailey .
no , you &apos;re in pain . you &apos;ve been standing all day .
here . sit down .
you know , i really-- i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t want to keep saying yes
and then not following through with it , okay ?
i @-@ i really don &apos;t .
no , i &apos;m a jerk for putting pressure on you .
you know what ? i think that i can try .
i can try . it &apos;s just--i need to adjust this thing .
let me help .
callie , don &apos;t .
i am an orthopedic surgeon .
let me try .
give me your hands .
now . can you remove your pants , please ?
okay , i got you .
whoa . that &apos;s not fixing it .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s taking it off !
look at me .
look at me .
i &apos;m gonna put my hand on your leg .
no , callie . don &apos;t .
the prosthetic is not the problem .
your leg &apos;s your problem .
i deal with residual limbs every single day .
it &apos;s ... they get sore .
is that okay ?
it feels better .
you know i could , um ...
i could give you a massage , too .
with your girlie hands ? forget it .
thank you , callie .
hey . right now i &apos;m dr. torres .
this came for you .
but ... i don &apos;t know if you want to see it .
it &apos;s not my call .
they &apos;re here , aren &apos;t they ?
a lot of them . they &apos;re in the lobby .
but i can also say that you can &apos;t have visitors .
three , two , one .
all right . he &apos;s all set .
avery , would you do the honors ?
six , seven ,
eight , nine ,
ten ,
eleven , twelve
thirteen
look at that .
it &apos;s worth every penny .
you can see the fractures of both legs .
and of the proximal aspect of the right radius and ulna
all in the same x @-@ ray .
it would &apos;ve taken , like ,
15 scans to get that much information before .
it &apos;s freakin &apos; magical .
mm . it was definitely worth waiting for .
let &apos;s get him out of there .
are you ready ?
good news first , stay calm .
can i hear the fishing story one more time ?
come on .
what took you so long ?
mr. kramer , the good news is , your daughter &apos;s alive .
until she wakes up
no , no , no .
no , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t you do that !
look , sir , please !
you &apos;re not gonna tell me that . you do not--
no !
listen !
your daughter ...
your daughter is alive , you hear me ?
listen to me .
your daughter is alive .
she &apos;s alive .
and we hope she &apos;s gonna wake up ,
but we don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen .
okay ? her vitals are stable .
but it doesn &apos;t do you or her any good
to be afraid of what we don &apos;t know .
let &apos;s get cleaned up , and you can go see her , okay ?
she always wears a helmet .
she ...
i make sure .
i know .
i always ...
i know .
i know .
mr. arnold always yells .
well , he &apos;s probably frustrated .
i @-@ i know you don &apos;t like him because he &apos;s not me .
but--but you didn &apos;t like me at first ,
did you ?
but at least you gave us free time
if we finished our homework .
maybe you should tell him
that that &apos;s how i did it ,
and that it motivated you .
if ...
if , um ...
mr. arnold were-- were going to be your teacher
for the rest of the year ,
what else could you do to--to help him ?
someone could offer him a mint .
that &apos;s a great idea .
but not in a mean way ,
just--just casually , right ?
what else ?
don &apos;t skip after @-@ school study sessions ?
you got it .
but he &apos;s not gonna be our teacher
for the rest of the year ,
is he ?
you &apos;re not gonna come back ,
are you ?
what would happen if i didn &apos;t ?
it &apos;d suck .
sorry .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;d suck .
now ...
what else can we do to help mr . arnold ?
come on . help me think .
what happened to cool and calm ?
yeah , well , that never would &apos;ve worked with a guy like this .
sometimes you gotta shake the hell out of &apos; em .
hey . you ready ?
yeah . page me with updates .
rough one ?
very .
me , too .
how &apos;s the baby , still kicking ?
quiet now . probably dead .
oh , meredith , stop .
well , i &apos; m just kidding .
mostly .
really , i need you to stop .
bad things happen ,
and it just makes me feel better
to be prepared when they do .
but you don &apos;t know how things are gonna turn out .
right . exactly what i &apos;m saying .
we own a hospital full of machines .
let &apos;s go find out everything we can .
he actually gave dr. bailey his pee .
anybody find out about this ,
i &apos;m throwing you under the bus .
you &apos;re not scared of this guy .
no , i &apos;m scared of dr. bailey .
hey , karev .
think he &apos;s onto us ?
that was pretty funny today .
uh , the--the pranks , the drug test , the pages ...
you guys , you really got me .
yeah , well , the kid &apos;s got a little crush on , uh , wilson .
we were just having a little fun .
oh , the kid does . right .
well , you two kids have fun laughing about it later
while i &apos;m nailing jo in the bathroom at the bar .
at first , idleness can seem like a welcome distraction--
the troublemaking and the fun .
she is asleep .
holy mother of--
could you , um , massage my leg again ?
uh @-@ huh . yeah .
a little higher .
there ?
mm . nope .
higher .
everyone needs some idle time
to focus on something other than work ...
even if it means focusing on something
that &apos;s a little bit scary .
are you nervous ?
no . just take a look , and then we &apos;ll know .
ohh . is there a huge teratoma growing out of its head ?
see for yourself .
look at you .
&quot; avery &apos;s too young , &quot; i said .
&quot; he &apos;s too inexperienced , &quot; i said .
&quot; he has no business running this hospital . &quot;
where you going with this , bailey ?
i was wrong is where i &apos;m going .
you all made a smart decision today .
i &apos;m not gonna disappoint you .
thank you .
stepping back from work
is the only way to get perspective .
whoa . what &apos;s all that ?
russell put me on the lotus valve trials .
i have to get through most of this tonight .
ah , is he piling it on a little heavy ?
yes , he is .
oh , are you gonna stay late and play with your new toys ?
they &apos;re not toys .
one , two ,
three , four ...
but they are pretty fun .
five , six ...
oh ! i see the marble .
seven ...
oh , eight ...
nine , ten .
see ? ten fingers .
and it &apos;s only after we have everything in perspective ...
eleven .
mm . that &apos;s not a finger .
oh . oh , it &apos;s a boy .
that we remember where our hands truly belong .
