phoebe , could you get that , please ?

you can &apos;t tell chandler .
i ran into richard .
which richard ?
the richard .
richard simmons ? oh , my god !
no , my ex @-@ boyfriend richard . you know , the tall guy , mustache .

how was it ?
it was really nice . we talked and i had lunch with him .
that &apos;s weird . i dreamed you had lunch with richard .
really ?
again , richard simmons .
go on .
the strange part was he was really nice and he looks great , ...
... but i didn &apos;t feel anything .
so why can &apos;t we tell chandler ?
because it would totally freak him out
and tomorrow &apos;s our anniversary . i don &apos;t wanna spoil it .
i can &apos;t believe you guys have lasted a whole year !
wow , i owe rachel 20 bucks .
what ?
on a totally different bet .
it &apos;s almost our anniversary !
i know .
one year ago today , i was just your annoying friend chandler .
now you &apos;re just my annoying friend chandler .
i got you a gift .
it &apos;s not till tomorrow .
i know , but you have to open it today .
okay
okay ! there you go !
it &apos;s two tickets to vegas !

we can call it our &quot; plane @-@ aversary . &quot;
do we have to ?
no
this is great , but joey didn &apos;t want any of us there .
he doesn &apos;t want us to go to any trouble .
he &apos;ll be excited when we surprise him .
plus , we get to have our own &quot; anna @-@ vegas @-@ ry &quot; !
&quot; anna @-@ vada @-@ versary ! &quot;
i think we should see other people .
we can go , right ? yes
great idea .
i &apos;m gonna go too !
phoebe , it &apos;s kind of our anniversary .
please , you won &apos;t ditch me like you did with london .
ditch you ? you were pregnant
great story . i &apos;m going .

including me !
do you wanna go ?
i can take a couple days off work .
of course you can take a couple days off , because this trip includes me !
i &apos;ve got a presentation tomorrow . i can &apos;t miss that .
i &apos;ve got tickets to the van gogh exhibit . i waited a year for this .
art lover .
what &apos;d you say ?
i said , art lover .
was that supposed to be an insult ?
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m very tired .
rach , maybe we can fly out saturday ?
sounds great.i &apos;ll call the airlines .
that &apos;ll be nice to have the apartment to myself .
to walk around naked .
no , so i can be by myself . have a little alone time .
naked alone time .
just because i &apos;m alone doesn &apos;t mean i wanna walk around naked .
you live alone , you don &apos;t walk around naked .
why does it takes me so long to answer the door ?
so far , is this trip to las vegas better or worse than the trip to london ?
so far , it &apos;s pretty much the same , phoebe .
what about after i give you these candies ?
i guess it &apos;s a little better now .
las vegas , 1 . london , 0 .
i &apos;ll be back .
happy plane @-@ aversary .
i love you .
can i give you your present now ?
okay !
oh , don &apos;t tell me i did this .
i love &quot; l forgot the present &quot; fake @-@ out !

you can give it to me when we get back .
this is the worst thing that could happen .
you decided to tell him about the richard thing .
what &quot; richard thing &quot; ?
oh , no .
what &quot; richard thing &quot; ?
simmons . go with simmons .
i ran into richard yesterday .
he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did .
i didn &apos;t tell you because ...
... you &apos;d get mad and i didn &apos;t wanna spoil our anniversary .
i &apos;m not mad .
really ? oh yes
so you bumped into richard . you grabbed a &quot; bite . &quot;
no big deal .

i &apos;m lighting the candles .
naked . and carefully .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s rachel , naked !
i can &apos;t look at that . i am looking at this .
okay , vivid colors , expressive brush strokes .
unless she wants me to be looking at that .
she knows i &apos;m home .
she knows i can see her .
what kind of game is she playing ?
i think maybe someone &apos;s lonely tonight .
dr. geller.stop it . you &apos;re being silly .
or am i ?

may i come in ?
yeah , if you want to .
do you want me to ?
yeah , sure ?
so do l .
okay , rach , before anything happens ...
... i wanna lay down a couple of ground rules .
this is just about tonight .
i won &apos;t go through with this if it &apos;ll raise the question of &quot; us . &quot;
i just want this to be ...
... about what it is .
and ... what is that , ross ?
the physical act of love .
what , are you crazy ?
so you weren &apos;t trying to entice me just now with your nakedness ?
oh , god . you saw me ?
you weren &apos;t trying to entice me with your nakedness ?
you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you ?
no
no ...
oh , wow . i &apos;m sorry . but , ross , you kicked off your shoes .
can we just forget this ever happened ?
of course . you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you . -yes .
i guess i &apos;m gonna go pack .
okay .
wait , one more thing .
do we still need to settle the question of &quot; us &quot; ?
hey , you guys , wait !
you guys .
this place is much better than london .
a lady dressed like cleopatra gave me this .
ninety @-@ nine cent steak and lobster dinner .
you don &apos;t eat animals .
for ninety @-@ nine cents i &apos;d eat you .
i can totally settle down here.it &apos;s got everything i could ever want .
including joey ! look !
look ! hey ! oh , my god .
joey
love your condoms , my man .
why are you here ? i told you not to come .
why are you dressed as a gladiator ?
because i &apos;m shooting a scene right now . i play a gladiator .
hold on a second .
can we cut ? my friends are here . i &apos;m gonna take a break .
who are you talking to ?
the director.her.
all right , it &apos;s not a gladiator movie . i work here .
why ? what happened ?
the movie shut down . ran out of money .
i &apos;m working here till it starts up , if it ever does .
i &apos;m so sorry . -such a drag .
sorry i didn &apos;t tell you . i &apos;m sorry .
apparently there &apos;s a new policy of not sharing .
i knew you weren &apos;t okay with that .
so you &apos;re a gladiator !
what &apos;s going on ?
monica had lunch with richard .
dawson ?
but that would &apos;ve been so cool !
her boyfriend richard .
it meant nothing . after all this time , how can you not trust me ?
when you go lunching with hunky men and don &apos;t tell me !
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . i should &apos;ve told you .
thanks.-there we go .
now i love vegas .
i promise you next time i absolutely will tell you .
&quot; next time &quot; ?
so close .
there won &apos;t be a next time . you cannot see him again .
i cannot see him ? you can &apos;t tell me what to do .
that &apos;s funny , i think i just did .
if you act like this , i won &apos;t be around you.-fine.
fine , happy anniversary !
guys , please ! come on , come on.this is obviously a misunderstanding .
no , it is not .
don &apos;t look at me . i just work here .
okay , ross ? i &apos;m a little warm , so i &apos;m gonna be taking off my sweater .
now , i &apos;m just letting you know ... this is not an invitation to the physical act of love .
yep , that &apos;s hilarious .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m done . i &apos;m done .
you know , last night was embarrassing for you too .
no , not really . you &apos;ve seen me naked hundreds of times .
but it was a first for the rest of my building .
that &apos;s true .
but i just don &apos;t embarrass that easily .
what ? you totally get embarrassed .
no , i don &apos;t . ross , i think i &apos;m just a more secure person than you are .
ls that so ?
yeah .
hey , lady ! i don &apos;t care how much you want it , okay ?
i am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom !
you know , in roman times , this was more than just a hat .
really ?
yeah , sure , sure .
they would scrub the floors .
they &apos;d use it to get the mud off their shoe .
sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.so they would stick it right
i can &apos;t believe this is how i &apos;m spending my anniversary .
i &apos;ll take you someplace nice .
a guy tipped me $ 100 .
he was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $ 5000 .
can you believe that ?
if i won $ 5000 , i &apos;d join a gym .
build up my upper body ... and hit richard from behind with a stick .
wait ! why don &apos;t i just do what that guy did ?
i &apos;ll take this $ 100 , turn it into $ 5000 ...
... and i &apos;ll turn that into enough to get my movie going !
good luck .
i don &apos;t need luck .
i &apos;ve thought this through.i see .
thanks .
i can &apos;t believe this . this is like the worst night ever .
you had a minor setback in your relationship .
big deal . it &apos;s only chandler .
i am so sorry .
this is crazy . such a stupid argument .... i don &apos;t wanna see richard .
so go fix it.find chandler . he &apos;s probably in your room .
tell him sorry and you love him .
