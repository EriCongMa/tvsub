why aren &apos;t you in bed ?
there &apos;s a zombie fight on the sidewalk out there .
jared , you are too old to be making up stories .
i don &apos;t make up stories !
the spider bite that rendered you unable to do homework ?
i could &apos;ve gone blind .
they were out there . i saw them .
this is why we don &apos;t do comic books before bed . go .
night .
morning .
hey .
what &apos;s that ?
research .
&quot; diagnostic and statistical manual
of mental disorders . &quot;
latest edition .
you don &apos;t have a mental disorder .
i have a condition that can affect the way i think .
or overthink .
well , it doesn &apos;t hurt to educate myself on current treatments .
on mental disorders that you don &apos;t ha-- okay .
you told me that you were feeling better ,
that you had no more symptoms .
yeah , but that can change at any moment .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
and i don &apos;t excel at doing nothing .
this is true .
so ... mm .
hi , ma .
hi , girls .
what &apos;s that ?
nothing .
what &apos;s that ?
a backpack .
what &apos;s it for ?
books .
are you taking a course ?
you could say that .
how nice !
so what are you studying ?
uh , bunch of subjects .
you know , you could say it &apos;s like a survey course .
hey , ang .
hi , max .
who &apos;s that ?
my study buddy .
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;re gonna nail the ged . right , ang ?
the ged ?
the high school equivalency test ?
max , would you mind waiting in the courtyard for me ,
just for a minute ?
i &apos;ll be right out .
sure .
thanks .
you never graduated high school ?
nope .
your father thought it was a waste of my time .
mom , i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i never knew that .
well , i don &apos;t go around advertising it .
it &apos;s kind of bothered me since i never finished , so ...
here i am .
this is great !
ma ! i &apos;m so proud of you !
thanks .
me , too .
oh , thank you , maura .
when -- when &apos;s the exam ?
uh , next month . it &apos;s a 7.1 / 2 hour test ,
and max and i have been cramming for it .
yeah , what &apos;s his story ?
he &apos;s very bright .
he , uh , dropped out to pursue his passion for farming .
in boston ? what &apos;s he farm ?
hydroponic marijuana , mostly .
gotta go !
i got the top down on my convertible .
you okay with that ?
yeah , sure . let &apos;s get to it . here .
cool pack .
have fun , ma .
remember , keep one foot on the floor at all times !
yet another brilliant idea from my father .
how dare he talk her out of getting a diploma ?
thanks .
well , i admire her courage .
it can &apos;t be easy to dive back into that coursework .
and she has max .
well , at least he wants to better himself .
i smell pot on her , she &apos;s grounded .
it is legal here .
for medical use .
my mother does not need medical marijuana .
she hallucinates when she takes too many decongestants .
zombie .
please tell me that &apos;s not real .
seems like some kind of a synthetic polymer .
silicone , maybe .
what about all the blood ?
well , that &apos;s real .
as is this tear in the posterior skull tissue .
likely a result of blunt impact .
he may have fractured his occipital bone .
looks like they struggled across the street
and made their way over here , where the victim went down .
we know who he is ?
we &apos;re running prints and facial recognition now .
so no id ?
none that belonged to him , but he had four wallets on him .
he &apos;s wearing booster pants
with all the hidden compartments .
oh , he &apos;s a pickpocket .
maybe somebody he robbed was on to him ,
went after him for revenge .
pretty conspicuous look for a thief .
maybe he was working a costume party .
still ...
maybe he &apos;s really a zombie .
well , then we would have no case because you can &apos;t kill a zombie .
they &apos;re already dead .
he &apos;s very talented .
i mean , this laceration on his cheek is a work of art .
he even discolored the subcutaneous tissue
to account for maggot infestation .
yay ?
well , we have to admire how real it looks .
i mean , this takes dedication .
there &apos;s a world record for the number of snails on a person &apos;s face .
that takes dedication , too ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean i have to admire it .
how many snails was it ?
that &apos;s not the point , maura .
43 .
i told her there was zombies out there .
zombies ? so more than one ?
two . fighting each other . it was awesome .
until she had to interrupt .
can you describe the second zombie ?
uh , he was classic . they both were .
meaning what ?
meaning ... they locomote on two legs .
as opposed to ...
stalkers , who move on all fours .
or crawlers . they have no legs at all .
then you &apos;ve got your bonies , who generally don &apos;t move
on account of their , uh ... advanced decomposition .
you know your zombies .
reanimation is my passion .
uh , was the other zombie male or female ?
i don &apos;t know .
was there anything unique about the second zombie ?
did he have tattoos , glasses ?
no . nothing like that .
okay , well , if he thinks of anything else , give us a call .
okay . thank you , detective .
come on .
look , i don &apos;t know if it was a guy or a girl ,
but i &apos;d recognize that zombie if i saw it again .
all right .
come on .
found this in the victim &apos;s pocket .
admission pass to the boston convention center .
does it say what the event was ?
yep .
i have a feeling he blended right in .
man .
severed limb workshop .
leashes and collars for undead pets .
you ... dropped your finger .
this is awesome .
come on . zombie children ? that &apos;s not cool .
hey , did you see the zombie santa claus ?
santa &apos;s not a zombie .
well , he never seems to age .
that &apos;s because he &apos;s filled with the magic of christmas , korsak .
detectives .
hank mills , convention security .
jane rizzoli . how long does this go on ?
for the whole week . we sell out every year .
have you noticed any , uh , fights , arguments ,
anything that would get your attention ?
nothing violent . but i checked the theft report like you asked ,
and there have been some wallets reported stolen .
seven , altogether .
uh ... you recognize him ?
who &apos;s he ?
kendall judd .
we found him a couple miles from here .
looked like he came right from the convention .
well , it doesn &apos;t ring a bell ,
but i wouldn &apos;t recognize him looking like that .
what do you mean ?
well , the guy could be my next door neighbor .
i wouldn &apos;t recognize him unless he &apos;s in a costume .
and he &apos;s probably using a zombie name .
like , for example , my name is hank ,
but everybody calls me &quot; beaver . &quot;
for the cleaver ?
right .
that &apos;s clever .
clever . cleaver .
beaver .
please stop .
we need the names of anyone who reported their wallet stolen .
sure thing .
yeah , everyone in costume . can &apos;t see who anybody really is ?
mm , it &apos;s a good cover for a thief .
are they getting married ?
great cover .
zombie makeup &apos;s as good as a ski mask for anonymity .
i &apos;ll take the ski mask .
what do you have against zombies ?
i &apos;m a homicide detective .
i do not understand the appeal of pretending to be dead .
oh , ho . maybe frankie can explain .
are you shopping ?
what ? there was a sale on blood capsules .
can we get out of here now , please ?
why ? are you scared ?
no .
this is &quot; night of the living dead &quot; all over again .
they &apos;re coming for you , jane .
no .
yes .
jane , they &apos;re coming for you .
no .
jane .
stop .
jane .
oh , thanks , ma .
hey , how &apos;s the study group going , angela ?
i &apos;m quitting .
why ?
we &apos;ve been putting off the math portion ,
and i realized why -- life is too short .
yeah , well , you can &apos;t just quit .
well , i don &apos;t get it no matter how many times i try .
anyway , when am i going to
need to do polynomial equations ?
i distinctly remember saying the same thing to you
when i was in the 10th grade .
and if memory serves ,
you did not support my wish to quit .
that &apos;s different .
how so ?
i &apos;m your mother .
ma . come on !
if you wanna pass the test , you gotta do the math .
it &apos;s impossible .
nobody can figure out these equations .
i bet the chief medical examiner of the commonwealth could .
okay , maura does not want to tutor me .
sure , she would !
she probably does polynomials in her bath to unwind .
it &apos;s hard to tell the real blood from the makeup , isn &apos;t it ?
i know .
these scars -- they &apos;re elaborate and creative .
this one on the forehead is made of corn syrup and gelatin .
delicious .
anyway , actual cause of death
is subarachnoid hemorrhage .
so from impact from the sidewalk , as i suspected .
you find the other nonedible wounds ?
oh , yeah .
x @-@ ray showed that the fourth metacarpal is fractured .
so he landed a blow before he went down ?
this makeup might &apos;ve transferred to his hand
after he struck his assailant .
right .
swab the hand for skin cells .
maybe we could recover some dna
that would identify who he was fighting .
i &apos;ll let jane know where we &apos;re at .
uh , maura ?
yes .
i &apos;ve actually been doing some research on your symptoms .
i think it &apos;s possible that you may have a chiari malformation .
that &apos;s a genetic condition , isn &apos;t it ?
congenital structural defect of the cerebellum , yeah .
it could &apos;ve been lying dormant until it was unmasked
by your head trauma .
i hadn &apos;t considered that .
hey , come on .
my research shows there &apos;s room for optimism .
i &apos;m sure there is .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just , um ...
daunting to objectively diagnose
something that affects me so deeply .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not your job to be objective .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
and i &apos;ve left the reading on your desk .
i &apos;ll take a look at it .
thank you .
sure .
so these are the stolen wallet victims ?
yep .
security said that seven people filed a report .
right . these are the four whose wallets you found on the body .
these are the other three victims .
their wallets are in the wind .
we talk to everybody ?
yeah . there &apos;s no likely suspects .
they were all at zombiecon at the time of the murder .
so seven people with motive , seven people with alibis .
what about credit cards ?
the suspect might still have some from the wallets
we didn &apos;t recover .
uh , if he doesn &apos;t know that we &apos;re on to him .
he might try and use &apos; em .
can you flag all the missing credit cards for me ?
anybody so much as buys as tank of gas ,
i wanna know about it .
this is my mug .
what ?
this is my mug . i left it at your house .
it is . you did .
problem ?
no .
it just has my drink in it ,
so i &apos;m gonna wash it out , and i &apos;ll get it back to you .
okay . all right .
i think jane knows that
you spent the night at my place last night .
because of a mug ?
or maybe because you &apos;re glowing .
stop .
are you avoiding telling her about us
for any particular reason ?
i &apos;m not avoiding .
you hate chai .
okay , maybe i was avoiding just a little bit .
but only because i don &apos;t want
my family butting into our relationship .
it &apos;s bad enough that my mom knows .
yeah , i understand .
there are a few gems in my family
that i prefer to keep in the dark for now , too .
okay , then .
i don &apos;t need everyone to know ,
as long as i know you &apos;re sure about us .
oh , i &apos;m sure ,
even if it means i have to drink all the chai in chai land .
this is interesting .
what is it ?
i &apos;m monitoring message boards and social media
around zombiecon .
this video just popped up with the title ,
&quot; pickpocket gets schooled . &quot;
that &apos;s our pickpocket .
look at that . she catches him red @-@ handed .
this must be cellphone footage .
who &apos;s the girl ?
doesn &apos;t look like any of the women who had filed reports . mm .
though , why would she file one
if she was planning to go kill him ?
our guy stole the wrong zombie &apos;s wallet .
mckenzie , right ?
yeah , so i &apos;m told .
nina reached out to the zombie community
to see if anyone could id the girl in the video .
that &apos;s what she came up with .
&quot; the zombie community &quot; ?
christine mckenzie .
aka &quot; dead ringer &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s me .
uh , we &apos;d like to speak to you about your stolen wallet .
what stolen wallet ?
your wallet that was stolen last night from zombiecon ?
i have my wallet . is there a problem ?
can you explain this ?
is that you ?
yeah , that &apos;s me , but i ...
i thought that guy was just trying to grab my ass .
i didn &apos;t know he stole my wallet . what a jerk .
could you tell us how you happen to have your wallet
in your possession in light of this photo ?
i @-@ i found it on my welcome mat this morning .
i @-@ i figured i just dropped it coming home .
do you have a roommate ?
anyone that can verify when you got home ?
no .
how about where you were between the time
your wallet was stolen and the time you got home ?
i was at the convention .
you have anyone to verify that ?
no . why are you guys so interested in where i was ?
because the person who stole your wallet is dead .
he is ?
you guys don &apos;t think that i had anything to do with this ?
i think that until you can verify your whereabouts ,
you should probably come with us .
let &apos;s go .
who doesn &apos;t know their wallet was stolen ?
and then has it miraculously returned ?
the zombie girl &apos;s story sucks .
it does , but we can &apos;t disprove it till we put her at the scene .
i ran a background on her .
anything interesting ?
a restraining order
filed against her boyfriend a year ago .
then there was also a police report .
i guess he was violent .
that &apos;s too bad .
maybe she was traumatized by the abusive ex @-@ boyfriend .
and then the run @-@ in with the victim made her snap .
i like it in theory ,
but she didn &apos;t seem like the type to snap .
what about the ex @-@ boyfriend ?
maybe he sees her with the victim
and then goes after him ?
let &apos;s find him , see what he was up to all night .
all right .
knock , knock . busy ?
not for you . come in .
i hate to bother you with this ...
jane already told me .
polynomial factoring ?
yeah , it &apos;s cruel and useless .
i have to disagree .
they are essential for work with coding and cryptography .
and they help build abstract problem solving skills .
still not selling it .
okay .
i know it can seem tedious .
but math can be tremendously elegant at times .
for example ...
wow . what is that ? &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; ?
it &apos;s an ulam spiral .
it shows that you can position any set of numbers
in a square grid ,
the prime numbers will always line up in perfect diagonals .
see ?
every time , no matter what number you start from .
and polynomial factoring is a useful tool
in understanding this phenomenon .
now tell me that this doesn &apos;t capture your imagination .
for the moment , the only thing capturing my imagination
is that dead body over there .
oh . i &apos;m sorry about that .
oh , can we try this again later ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;m just gonna let it all sink in .
okay .
still processing the samples from the skin and clothes .
should have a detailed analysis very soon .
uh , what about the wallets ?
the four wallets from the scene
all had the victim &apos;s blood on them .
also , christine &apos;s wallet had the victim &apos;s blood on it .
so christine &apos;s wallet was on him when he fell and bled ?
very likely .
well , then she pulled it out of his pocket and then took off .
well , i can &apos;t testify to that .
why ?
a bloody wallet only means that it was on the victim
at the time he was bleeding .
it doesn &apos;t place christine herself at the scene .
well , it &apos;s a good thing i have a witness who can .
no one at the convention volunteered for the lineup ?
not one . said they were paranoid about picked out by mistake .
zombie profiling . it &apos;s a real thing .
you look disgusting .
thank you .
you just had to get in on this , huh ?
well , we needed the volunteers ,
and i &apos;ve got a really good stagger .
even if jared id &apos;s christine ,
this is not gonna hold up ... in court .
probably not , but it &apos;ll justify holding her .
and looks like we have our zombie lineup .
take your time .
can you make them groan ?
can i get a groan
from each of the zombies , left to right , please ?
can you make them say ,
&quot; brains ... &quot; ?
you didn &apos;t tell us the suspect said , &quot; brains . &quot;
they didn &apos;t . i just thought it &apos;d be cool .
you should know i &apos;m inclined to detain you .
that would be unlawful .
i &apos;ll come up with something .
yeah , it &apos;s none of these people .
you sure ?
yeah .
and also ...
that guy ? really ?
what about him ?
that &apos;s the cop that interviewed me at my house .
your killer &apos;s not here .
sorry .
turned out to be a more reliable witness than i expected .
mm , yeah .
and we just lost our best suspect .
so if we take christine at her word ,
her wallet was taken off of the dead body ,
and returned to her the night of the murder .
without her knowledge .
yeah , who does that ?
good samaritan ?
okay , well , then why didn &apos;t he return all the wallets ?
good point .
and how did this mystery man
get into christine &apos;s building anyway ?
he lives there . he has access .
followed her home without her knowing .
or she knew and she &apos;s covering for someone .
what happened to the other three wallets
that weren &apos;t at the crime scene ?
we talked to all the owners .
none of them got their wallets returned .
okay , so this is about christine .
maybe he knows her .
well , the boyfriend &apos;s a dead end .
he lives in missouri now .
she claims she doesn &apos;t know anybody else
who might &apos;ve done something like this .
yeah , i wish i could believe her .
paul grossman .
he reported one of the wallets stolen that we didn &apos;t recover .
did he get it back ?
no , which is interesting
because he just bought a vacuum cleaner in dorchester ,
according to his credit card company .
please tell me there &apos;s security footage .
yeah . nina already ran the image through facial recognition .
the guy &apos;s name is terrence griffins .
has a history of petty theft .
and a fondness for zombie conferences , i bet .
uniforms are already on their way to pick him up .
no dna matches from the blood samples on the victim ?
nope . nothing .
okay , then we &apos;ll have to wait for a tox report .
you mean trace chemical analysis ?
what did i say ?
another slip .
no , no , you just -- you ... you misspoke .
or i &apos;m losing it .
or you &apos;re so scared of having a slip
that you &apos;re giving yourself a complex .
that &apos;s a very unscientific justification .
look , maura , if the military has taught me one thing ,
it &apos;s you make assessments based on facts on the ground .
now you &apos;ve not had a lapse in ages .
and we now have a potential diagnosis ,
which means treatment options .
it is not the time to panic .
i appreciate your optimism ,
but i feel that i owe it to the people i serve
to be the sharpest mind in the room .
yeah , and you are that mind .
i &apos;m not so sure .
and i can &apos;t tell you how frightening it is to have to admit .
i &apos;ll , uh ...
i &apos;ll continue with my analysis .
hey , vince .
could you do me a favor ?
could you bring this to maura when you go back to the station ?
sure . what &apos;s the occasion ?
i just want to thank her for helping me with that exam .
she was able to help you ?
she did the best she could .
but i &apos;m a lose cause , and ...
well , i ...
i dropped out of my group .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
you don &apos;t seem relieved .
well , i &apos;m not . i feel terrible .
why is that ?
because after i dropped out , max texted me
and told me he &apos;s giving up , too .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
oh , he &apos;s a bright kid .
and this could be a chance for him to --
to totally turn his life around .
maybe he just needs some encouragement . he probably looks up to you .
well , i can &apos;t tell him not to quit . i &apos;d be a hypocrite .
not if you take the test .
but what if i fail ?
well , you definitely will if you don &apos;t try .
you &apos;ve got a lot of a theft charges
for a guy barely out of high school , terrence .
what are you doing stealing wallets ?
what wallets ?
from zombiecon .
how do you know i was at zombiecon ?
because i &apos;m a better cop than you are a thief .
tell me about kendall judd .
who ?
i &apos;m gonna say this once .
you and kendall were both lifting wallets
from that convention , and now one of you is dead .
i need to understand your relationship
or best case , i arrest you for obstruction .
worst case , you become my number one suspect .
i &apos;ve been hitting zombiecon for years .
it &apos;s my turf .
kendall was threatening my whole operation .
how so ?
the thing with the girl that went viral ?
that &apos;s bad for everyone &apos;s business .
so you wanted him to back off ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t kill him .
but i wasn &apos;t the only one he pissed off .
what do you mean ?
some other guy followed kendall outside .
maybe one of his marks . i don &apos;t know .
i figured he &apos;d teach kendall a lesson for me , too .
can you describe this guy ?
about my age .
skinny . tattered clothes .
his makeup was super elaborate .
anything else ?
he had a limp .
doesn &apos;t everyone have a limp at zombiecon ?
yeah , when you &apos;re in character ,
not when you &apos;re ducking out the back door
to kick the guy &apos;s ass that just robbed ya .
i have the trace chemical analysis
from the victim &apos;s fist .
corn syrup .
from the fake blood .
mineral oil and titanium dioxide from the stage makeup .
also , there was a fair amount of real blood
from two different blood types .
the victim &apos;s and the suspect &apos;s ?
most likely .
okay . did you find any dna ?
no , uh , matches ,
but i did want to show you this .
castor seed oil , fumed silica , sucrose acetate --
ingredients found in something called microskin .
what &apos;s that ?
lightweight , waterproof cosmetic product
with exceptional breathability ,
ideally used for burn victims .
that was on our victim &apos;s hand ?
likely rubbed off during contact .
so this wasn &apos;t normal zombie makeup ?
no . microskin is expensive .
application is more involved than regular makeup .
and you can only get it through the manufacturer .
he used it because he needed it .
right .
we &apos;re not looking for a zombie .
we &apos;re looking for a burn victim .
thanks .
a burn victim ?
someone with a facial disfigurement
where he might need to cover it up with makeup .
i can &apos;t think of anyone .
he might also have a pronounced limp .
what ? you know someone like that ?
it -- it can &apos;t be him . - who ?
this guy who waters the plants in my building -- he limps .
he &apos;s really shy . i @-@ i always felt so sorry for him .
how much did you talk to him ?
i complimented him on his work on our rooftop garden .
that &apos;s about it .
what about zombiecon ?
i don &apos;t think i mentioned it to him .
i mean , i @-@ i guess he could &apos;ve seen me leave in my costume .
oh , god . do you think that he followed me there ?
do you know his name ?
zachary bale .
he worked at a greenhouse that services plants all over boston ,
including the building christine lives in .
this photo is from his employee badge .
there &apos;s the facial scarring .
christine probably didn &apos;t notice it through the makeup .
the greenhouse owner confirm the limp ?
yeah .
he also said he fired zachary recently for stealing plants .
who steals plants ?
the owner confronted him about it ,
and then zachary became real agitated .
owner said he seemed unstable .
emotionally unstable burn victim with a limp
and a fixation on christine .
and access to her building .
did we pick him up ?
here &apos;s the thing .
the owner paid in cash and didn &apos;t ask many questions .
he never verified zachary &apos;s id .
so the address he gave was a fake ?
everything was a fake .
i can &apos;t find any background on anyone by this name .
emotionally unstable burn victim using an alias .
i &apos;m gonna warn christine to be looking out for this guy .
that burn makeup is the key .
he &apos;d have to use a real address
to have it delivered somewhere he can pick it up .
check with the manufacturer , see where in the area they ship .
we &apos;re running down addresses where microskin ships .
might be our best clue to this guy &apos;s identity .
well , i hope you get the results quickly .
yeah , you said you needed to give me something ?
yes .
well , i have been reading the research
about chiari malformations .
it may be the source of my condition .
okay . what &apos;s it say ?
well , there is a procedure to alleviate the pressure
on the cerebellum , and it could eliminate my symptoms entirely .
well , this is great , right ?
well , there &apos;s also a chance that it doesn &apos;t work
or my symptoms worsen ,
rendering me unable to perform my duties .
but that &apos;s not gonna happen .
maybe not .
but until i can be sure ,
i can &apos;t let our cases rest in the balance .
what &apos;s this ?
my resignation .
if the day comes -- - maura .
come on . this is a little premature , don &apos;t you --
no , this is more than prema-- this is like the nuclear option .
i just wanna be prepared for the worst @-@ case scenario .
i don &apos;t want you to have the burden of having
to make that call for me down the road .
well , what about the best @-@ case scenario ?
you know , the one where you get better ?
look ... maura , i know this is scary for you .
it &apos;s scary for me , too , okay ?
and -- and i will hold on to this if that &apos;s what you want .
but i know i &apos;m not gonna need it .
i just don &apos;t wanna let anyone down .
you never have .
okay ?
nina &apos;s got something .
look , we -- we &apos;re gonna talk more about this later .
okay ? everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
dr. maura isles does not resign .
so nina got a list of local addresses
where microskin ships .
i pulled dmv photos for all recipients
to compare them to our suspect &apos;s work badge ,
and i found a match .
nice .
his real name is jeremy kendricks .
it looks like he was disfigured in a childhood accident .
i can &apos;t imagine kids on the playground were kind .
he &apos;s got a spotty work history , moves around a lot .
arrest record ?
yeah . bar fights and vandalism .
杰里米 · 肯德里克斯
he &apos;s angry . has been for a long time .
okay , did we talk to christine ?
yep . i told her the suspect &apos;s real name
and to stay put until we find him .
where was she when you spoke to her ?
she &apos;s on her way home .
that may be a problem .
jeremy kendrick &apos;s cellphone is pinging
off the same tower as christine &apos;s .
he got fired . he lives on the other side of town .
he has no business in that area . he &apos;s going after her .
杰里米 · 肯德里克斯
i &apos;ve been waiting for this moment .
i thought you were someone else .
sorry to disappoint you .
she &apos;s not coming .
she got your note , and we told her to stay put .
and who are you ?
jane rizzoli , boston police .
christine called the police on me ?
no , she didn &apos;t do anything .
but you and i , we need to talk about
what happened with her wallet .
nothing happened . all right ? that guy was bothering her .
yeah , we know that part .
he shouldn &apos;t have touched her .
so you went after him ?
no , i was trying to help .
look , she &apos;s nice to me . i just -- i just wanted to help .
jeremy , jeremy , hey .
look at me . look at me , all right ? look .
hey , look at me .
let &apos;s talk about this , okay ?
yeah , come away from the ledge , man .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like !
okay , so just explain it to us .
zombiecon ...
was the first place that i felt ... normal .
people weren &apos;t staring at me , all right ? i was finally gonna ...
i was finally gonna talk to her .
why &apos;d he have to spoil it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t mean to kill him .
i believe that .
j @-@ jeremy , hey , i believe that .
no , you don &apos;t .
i do .
no , you don &apos;t . you think i &apos;m a monster , a freak !
hey , jeremy !
listen to me , okay ? i think that you have had a very ,
very hard road , all right ?
but you still wanted to do something nice for christine .
i @-@ i admire that . we all -- we admire that .
it doesn &apos;t have to be the end of the road .
nobody wants that .
come on .
nobody cares !
jeremy , stop !
please . please don &apos;t do this .
come on .
come on , jeremy .
come on .
you okay ?
yeah .
all right , thanks .
d.a. was still up ?
based on the nature of the wounds ,
he &apos;ll consider involuntary manslaughter ,
conditional to jeremy getting therapy .
he could be out in a few years .
well , he &apos;s young .
if he gets the help he needs , might be a shot for him .
maybe .
i hate that word . &quot; freak . &quot;
this kid could &apos;ve had a good life
if people had just been kind ,
you know ? not treat him like a monster .
same thing could be said for zombies .
what ?
they didn &apos;t ask to be the way they are .
can they help it if they find human brains delicious ? no .
poor schmucks can &apos;t do a damn thing about it .
i feel you need a new hobby .
good night .
good night .
jane .
huh . what ?
one more thing . i &apos;ve been thinking .
there &apos;s something i want you to know .
what ? what is it ?
well , it &apos;s fairly new at this point .
it &apos;s about me and -- - there you are .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i -- frankie , i really need to talk to you , privately .
rain check .
yeah , i &apos;ll get the next one .
i was telling her about us .
i know .
then why &apos;d you stop me ?
because the fact that you were willing to do it
means more to me than you actually doing it .
really ?
plus , it &apos;s fun to have a secret , don &apos;t you think ?
i think that i really want to kiss you right now .
you &apos;re just gonna have to wait .
how is that fun ?
thanks .
hey , max .
you wanted me to come down ?
yeah , i wanted to talk about our study group .
what group ? we quit .
have a seat .
max , you know , before you were even born ,
somebody told me i didn &apos;t need that diploma .
and i was naive enough to listen .
i didn &apos;t know that eventually ,
i would be divorced from that dope .
i didn &apos;t know i &apos;d be working at this bar .
i mean , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know a lot of things .
nobody knows the future .
exactly .
it is , by definition , unknown .
the future is &quot; x. &quot;
a variable .
so i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re ever gonna have to use this math ,
but i know that if we work together ,
we could pass that exam .
yeah , i understand .
i need your help .
can &apos;t do it alone .
yeah , i &apos;m in .
yeah ?
yeah .
thank you .
all right .
you &apos;ll be back here tomorrow ?
i &apos;ll see you then .
okay .
hi , ma .
hey , honey .
oh , my god ! you , too ?
it &apos;s kent &apos;s handiwork .
analyzing the victim &apos;s makeup made him wonder
if he could improve on the formula .
and it took a lot of tries
to achieve the correct viscosity of rotten flesh .
there &apos;s a lot going on in that sentence , maura .
hey , janie . what can i get ya ?
uh , i &apos;ll have a beer .
and some neosporin .
come on . admit it .
this looks just like advanced stage
arthropod @-@ induced decay .
you want me to say that to you like it &apos;s a compliment .
i just want you to be honest .
you look very ... decayed ?
happy ?
yes !
all right . ugh .
well , actually , compared to these guys ,
you kind of phoned it in , don &apos;t you think ?
can i help you ?
we heard it &apos;s first drink free for anyone dressed as zombies .
you did ? from who ?
me . i had some business cards in my pocket ,
so i handed them out at the convention .
you know , build our client base .
can we get some shots ?
oh , here we go . yeah .
i hope the undead are good tippers .
nope !
no .
no . you &apos;re not even old enough to be in here .
thank you , ma . appreciate it .
no .
no . yes .
no .
