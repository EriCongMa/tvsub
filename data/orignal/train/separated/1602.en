What do you want me to say? I didn't take the truck.
I checked his prints. They don't mathe ones on the steering wheel.
I saw the two of you kiss, after the party.
The only way to protect everyone is to separate you and A.J.
I'm wondering why you felt the need
to take out a restraining order against your son.
That was expunged.
I'm afraid I can't make a recommendation on her adoption
until I investigate this further.
While I am, it's not appropriate for Callie to be in your care.
You look amazing.
Stop saying that. Really, stop.
Look, these earrings... too much, right?
Yes?
Yeah, maybe something a little smaller.
Yeah, smaller would be better.
Whoops? No.
Oh, wait. Try these here.
Oh, jeez, I can't even believe I'm going on this date
and leaving you here alone.
There's something really wrong with that.
I'll be fine, all right? You're just nervous.
I'm not nervous. I'm terrified.
I haven't been on a date
since the Bush administration,the first one.
"Don't go blowing something up that could be great
Just because you're scared." You told me that.
Did I say that?
Yeah.
I'm gonna start listening to me.
All right, there. Studs, yes?
Definitely studs.
Fantastic.
Okay, so, Brandon, tomorrow the social worker
is going to interview you and Callie separately.
What am I supposed to say?
Well, the truth...
That after the restraining order you didn't see Callie
until we brought her home from girls united.
And that you've had a strictly brother-and-sister,
platonic relationship ever since.
So then all of this will be over and Callie can come home?
And that idiot judge will let us adopt her?
Yeah, that's the plan.
A.J., I spoke with your probation officer.
And he wants to meet with you tomorrow.
You told him I didn't steal any car, right?
Yeah, absolutely. I explained the whole mess.
It's just that Mike has a foster care class
tomorrow all day, so I'monna take you.
And what are doing about
finding that douchebag that sold us a stolen car?
Mariana.
I'm gonna ask captain Roberts
to put a robbery detective on the case.
Really?
No.
We're out, like, $1400.
Got what you deserved, if you ask me.
Well, I didn't ask you.
And now you have to share your car with us, so you lose too.
Even if we did catch the guy, you know, I seriously doubt
that you're ever gonna see a penny of that money again, love.
What, so he gets away with it,
Just like that guy with the hit-and-run that almost killed us?
Oh, but we didn't die, so I guess that's not a priority either.
Your mom has worked very, very hard
try to find the person responsible for that, Mariana.
Unfortunately, justice is not always served in this world.
Yeah, just ask Callie.
Okay, listen. I know that this is very upsetting for all of us,
but this is simply a temporary setback.
Callie's gonna be back hom very soon.
And for now, she's safe and sound at Rita's, okay?
Who is it?
It's Chloe. Is Rita home?
I'm sorry, she's not here.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Callie. I'm staying with Rita.
But she went out.
When will she be back?
I'm not sure. She's kind of on a date.
A date? Really?
Well, that's not gonna last very long.
Do you mind if I wait inside?
It's okay. I'm her daughter.
Oh. Yeah, of course. Come in.
Well, that's new.
So how do you know my mother?
Um, I was in girls united for a little while.
Oh, you're one of her lost girls?
Well, she's just fostering me for a few days
until my regular foster parents get their license renewed.
What happened to their license?
Did they do something wrong?
No.
I kind of did.
Drugs?
No.
Boys?
A hottie like you... I bet it was a boy, right?
Um, maybe I should call Rita, let her know you're waiting.
I'll do it.
There.
Forewarned.
You mind if I use the bathroom?
Thanks.
No, of course.
Well, I guess she's not coming, so I'm gonna go.
Oh, okay. Well, it was nice to meet you.
Well, that was a bust.
Hi, mom.
What are you doing here?
Just getting to know my new foster sister.
I'm not gonna give you any money.
Okay, first of all,
I'm not here to ask you to give me any money.
I'm here to offer you an opportunity to invest.
It's a sure thing.
What is it this time?
A food truck. The guy who owns it
is upside down and he needs cash fast.
I mean, he's practically giving it away.
And food trucks are all the rage right now.
I mean, these guys are making money hand over fist.
Really? So why is he selling it?
Because he mismanaged.
And you're gonna fix that? You don't know anything
about the food business. You don't even cook.
Why can't you ever believe in me?
I have believed in you, Chloe,
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars,
all of which you wasted.
Because you sabotage everything that I do.
Are you off your medication?
Oh, here we go.
Whenever I have any legitimate feelings,
I must be off my meds.
You just want me checked out so I don't have to feel
the pain that you caused me.
Okay, listen, I do not want to do this.
Too bad I'm not a juvenile delinquent.
You need to go now.
Oh, wait. Callie, was it?
Let me tell you something about my mother
Saint Rita, savior of lost souls,
as long you aren't her own daughter.
Thanks again for nothing, mom.
I just can't believe we're in the same boat with Callie again.
I know she fine with Rita,
but I just can'telp feeling like this is all our fault.
You mean my fault?
What? You told me not to get the restraininorder.
I had it expunged.
I never thought about paper copies
lingering in some social worker's file.
Well, why would you?
Because I should have
I should have, Lena.
It all gonna be all right.
So, honey, we need to schedule therapy for the week.
Is Friday okay for you?
Can we skip a week?
We just... we have so much going on.
We always have a lot going on.
Okay, well, I cannot focus on us
until we get our daughter back. I'm sorry.
Okay, I'll let Dr. Melvoy know.
Okay.
A restraining order, huh?
What, were you, like, stalking her?
No.
Not at it's any of your business.
Yo, what's your beef with me, huh?
I came clean about talking to my brother,
and taking your dumb baseball.
Yeah, after I caught you. Doesn'change the fact that you lied.
Oh, you never lie?
You never took something that wasn't yours?
You're not even gonna try to get along with him?
He's not gonna be here much longer.
No, then he's gonna move in with Mike
and be your foster brother.
Look, I don't need him giving me the third degree about Callie.
Feel bad enough as it is.
You are over her, right?
Yes.
You're sure?
Yes.
Look, I already had my chance to get back with her.
I said no.
Wait, when was this?
Uh, when Robert said
he wasn't gonna sign the papers,
Callie was freaking out and...
Well, you two better get your stories straight.
If the social worker finds out about this,
we'll really lose her for good.
Well, doesn't look like she took anything.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea...
How could you have known?
I would have told you, but I didn't know she was talking to me.
So she takes things?
Yeah.
She doesn't consider it stealing.
She feels she's entitled because I was such a horrible mother.
She did look through your mail.
What?
Yep, a check's missing.
I never saw her touch your checkbook.
Well, she's pretty tricky at that.
I mean, don't worry about it.
It's not the first time I've had to cancel a check that Chloe stole.
You said she's... she's on meds?
Yeah, she's bipolar, axis I.
She's already difficult,
But when she's off her medication,
she's even more paranoid and irrational.
Must be hard.
It is,
for both of us.
Hey, so now that Callie's at Rita's,
where's A.J. gonna go until dad gets his license?
Uh, well,
Mama and I are just...
we're gonna get our license renewed.
Why? You're not gonna foster any more kids, are you?
No, no, no, no. It's just in case
Callie's adoption gets delayed,
To make sure that we can keep fostering her.
Didn't you renew your license
last time callie was taken out of the house?
Uh, no, no, no.
That was... that was just an extension.
So A.J.'s not leaving then?
I'm just asking.
B, i know that you have your issues with A.J.,
but you have had it just a little bit easier than he has,
so please don't be this way.
So there weren't, like, any cameras at this intersection?
Isn't that kind of weird?
Yeah, these days. But what's really weird
is that there were cameras around there
that should have caught the driver trying to get away.
Well, maybe he didn't try to get away.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe he hid somewhere
or waited till dark or for someone to come pick him up.
That's actually a really good theory.
Are you sure you don't want to be a cop?
Good nigh mom.
Good night, love.
I was feeling pretty good about myself, you know.
I had the tool belt on and knew exactly what I was doing.
I'm was even videoing the whole thing with my cell phone, right?
Yeah, that I'd like to see.
The next thing I know, the pipe bursts
and water's just...
Oh, no. What did you do?
Cried like a baby.
Just sitting there on the floor, in a puddle, sobbing.
Never fear. Shaz is here.
And I promise I will treat your pipes with gentle, loving care.
Well, thank you.
I hope you're not getting in Shaz's way.
Oh, no, not at all.
No, I don't mind the company.
Stef, you need to get dressed and get to work.
Oh my gosh, I'd better get out of here.
I'm so glad you're here.
She seems great, huh?
So what's it like living with Rita?
I bet her place like is messy.
I hope you've got your own room and a lock on the door.
No, Rita went on a date with a guy.
You're the only lesbian here, private Cruz.
Private?
Yeah, I got my G.E.D. and I join the army in two weeks.
Congratulation Carmen.
That's been your goal for, like, so long.
Yeah, Rita helped me get a waiver,
Since, you know, I have a record.
All I gotta do now is pass the physical,
and I start basic training.
Good luck, girl. You think this place is strict.
Yeah, but in the army I get to shoot an m32 grenade launcher.
Ooh, maybe I should join the army,
get one of those hot navy seals.
Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.
Shut your pie hole.
So what if this social worker finds out
you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?
She won't.
Brandon better not tell her about the last time.
What last time?
Thanks, Kiara. Thank you.
Oh, sorry.
I kissed Brandon at the G.U. Fundraiser,
but only because Robert told me
that he wasn't gonna let me get adopted,
and I thought...
I was giving up Brandon for nothing.
But he's told me that he's over it, so...
Are you over him?
Yeah, totally.
Because she's got a new foster brother.
And he is fine.
Stop it. It's not like that.
Yeah.
Not like what?
Huh-uh, no. You gotta go do touch-ups.
Those dishes have been sitting in the sink since the morning.
They're not mine. And I'm not cleaning up after some stanky slobs.
They are too yours.
And you're the stank.
Hey, watch the way you speak to one another.
She's mouthing off again.
So?
Give her an unacceptable and walk away.
Brooke, Carmen is house foreman. She is in charge.
She ain't in charge of me.
Th attitude is the reason why you have no privileges.
She's the one with the attitude.
Really?
She is a girl who came here
and who worked this program and made her dreams come true.
Now you can get up
and get into the kitchen and do your chores,
or you can get your butt kicked out of here.
Okay, ladies, this is not a coffee klatch, okay?
Please, homework. Thank you very much.
Callie, we leave here in a few.
Yeah
What crawled up her ass?
She's acting hella crazy.
So what are we doing here?
Well, the driver...the driver of the hit-and-run...
The only way he could have left the scene
was down this alley,
because none of the security cameras caught him on tape.
So Brandon had the idea that maybe
he hid in this alley until the coast was clear.
Was it hard on Brandon...
You bringing home all these kids?
Uh, well, he was young
when the twins came to live with us.
And I think he enjoyed not being the only child anymore.
And he's been great with Callie and Jude
for the most part.
Maybe he hid in the dumpster...
The driver.
Or maybe went up the fire escape.
Or maybe he got on a bus.
So, as you know,
I asked to speak to both you and Callie.
This isn't an interrogation.
I just wanted to here from your point of view,
what transpired between you two.
Um, okay. Well ... I think we...
Sorry, just talk about yourself.
Oh, okay.
Um, well, I... I...
My feelings just sort of developed
gradually, I guess.
And I thought she and Jude were only gonna be with us temporarily.
But you knew foster siblings aren't allowed
to engage in any sort of romantic relationship.
Yes.
And we...
I tried my best not to act on anything.
And we never...
But you kissed.
Yes, once.
When was that?
Um, at my moms' wedding.
Why?
Why did we kiss?
Why then? Did something happen?
No.
They asked if they could adopt us.
And what did you say?
We said yes.
And this was before or after you kissed Brandon?
After, definitely.
Before. It was that morning.
I... I was trying
to blow it up, I guess.
I didn't feel like I deserved to be adopted.
And who initiated the kiss?
I did.
It was me, definitely.
To mess things up before they got messed up?
Yeah.
So your feelings for Brandon weren't genuine?
No, they were.
Would you say you were in love?
I guess. Yes.
And now?
I love her.
I love him.
As a sister.
As a brother.
And your foster moms had no idea?
No. That's why they sent me
to Girls United when they found out.
They never would have let us live under the same roof
if they'd thought anything was going on between us.
Okay, I just have one more question for you, Brandon.
Did you everiolate the restraining order?
What?
Did you ever see Callie secretly, when she was at Girls United?
Uh, no.
Okay then. Thank you, for talking to me.
Can I ask you thank you a question?
Sure.
Um, my moms were just worried
their foster license may expire
before Callis adoption comes through.
So they were wondering
if they needed to renewed it, just in case.
On, no, they're fine.
Their license is good for another two years.
Okay, great.
I will let them know.
I remember a young man,
African-American, got on the bus,
blood all over his shirt and face.
He was real jumpy.
There was blood?
Oh, yeah.
'cause I had to clean it
off his seat before I started my next run.
Okay, do you happen to remember which stop it was that he got off?
I think so.
Pretty sure I let him off on Frontera,
right in front of that big pharmacy.
So right now there are three user interfaces
so one is like a search engine
for foster kids to find out where to get the stuff they need.
And the second is where kids can find
family and friends that, you know, they've lost contact with.
And tell them what you're calling it.
It's called "Fost and found."
"Fost and found?"
I think it's clever.
Yeah.
That's cool.
And then there's gonna be a story corps interface
where basically kids can upload audio
and videos of themselves telling their stories about the system.
What kind of stories?
Anything.
But, I mean, the idea is
to call out social workers that aren't doing their jobs,
unfit foster families,
the judges that keep rulingrs that against adoptions.
What about sketchy group homes
where they force you to do slave labor?
By all means, Brooke, alert the media
to the horrors here at Girls United.
Okay, well, maybe not this one,
but there are some really nasty group homes out there.
What are you doing it for?
It's for school credit,
But also it's so that foster kids
can have a voice and be heard.
Well, it's not like we can use it.
They don't let us use the internet.
Yes, but you're not gonna be here forever. Right, Dee?
So I was hoping
maybe I could record some of your stories
and upload them for you.
Daphne, you could talk about how hard it's been
for you to get visitations with Tasha.
Yeah, but I don't want to mess up my chances of getting her back.
My probation hearing's coming up.
We can't risk making things harder for ourselves.
And you're so close to getting adopted,
you can't go around kicking the hornet's nest either.
What do you think?
Well, most of the people I know working in the system
do care, you know.
and they try their best to do their jobs.
Yeah.
And there are abuses.
Someone needs to call them out on it.
But it's a lot to ask of kids who could suffer the consequences.
Maybe you need to find some kids that have less lose.
It's so great to work for clients I like for a change.
That's nice of you to say that.
Well, it's true, I mean,
you've got a beautiful home,
a beautiful family. And your partner Stef...
what a great gal, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I really lucked out in the wife department.
Yeah, you really did.I mean,
They don't make broads like that anymore, you know?
Like, really strong but feminine...
I bet she looks hot in her uniform.
Oh, hey there.
How's it going?
Good, good.
Okay.
There you go. We'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, okay. All right.
Have a good one.
Yeah.
Where did you find her?
What?
Hey, B.
Hey, honey.
How did...
How did the interview go with the social worker, B.
Fine.
Just fine?
What did she say? What did she ask?
She asked me
if I was still in love with Callie.
Okay, and what did you say.
I told her that I'm not the foster brother that she has to worry about.
What is that mean?
You tell me.
I know you that your foster license didn't expire.
And since A.J. is only living here now that Callie'not...
That can only mean one thing, right?
So is that it?
Is Callie hooking up with A.J. now?
Uh, the night of her birthday party...
I saw A.J. and Callie kiss.
So are you gonna get a restraining order against him?
It's a very different situation, Brandon.
A.J. is not gonna be Callie's brother.
If it's so different, then why did you lie?
Why didn't you just tell us that A.J.
has to live somewhere else?
Because we didn't want to embarrass them.
But you didn't mind humiliating me?
It's not the same thing.
Stop saying that, mom.
It is the same.
The only difference is, good old Brandon
has to take it on the chin.
Every time you bring stray kid into this house
without even asking me how I feel about it.
Luckily, I'm out of here a year anyway.
And you can adopt all the kids you want,
turn this place into a group home for all I care,
because it's obvious you guys do not want to live along together.
Excuse me?
What, you don't think we can't hear you bickering all the time?
We know you're in therapy
so maybe you guys should just worry about your own relationship for once.
You cancelled the check?
The one you stole from me?
You bet I did.
I'm your daughter, mom. Do you even care I starve to death?
Yes, Chloe, I do care. I care very much.
But I'm not going to continue to enable you.
Enable? Is that your excuse for being bad mother?
I know. I know that's the way you feel, Chloe.
You've said it to me a million times.
No, mom.
It's not the way that feel. It's the truth.
I'm not gonna talk to you when you're acting like this.
I hate you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
And daddy hated you, too.
Because you made him miserable.
And that's why he killed himself.
Don'you ever lay your hands on me again.
I'm sorry to let you see that.
You know, I've been punched.
I've been kicked, I've been spit on by girls before.
And I always managed to keep it together.
But you know, my own daughter.
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, I do. Okay?
I mean, she took the divorce very hard.
And maybe, it was my fault.
You know I've always, always been married to my work.
But I didn't realize how depressed he had gotten.
Chloe is the one who found him.
Yeah, I tried to pull her closer,
but she blamed me.
And I felt guilty.
So every time she asked for money,
I just wrote her a check.
Basically I broke every rule that we try to teach you at G.U.
And now...
now I'm finally drawing boundaries
she thinks I'm cruel and heartless.
She is right about one thing...
I am a terrible mother for letting it get to this point.
No, you are not a terrible mother, okay?
She said some really horrible things to you.
And it's not like when the G.U. Girls lash out.
She's your daughter. Of course it hurts.
I think I need to take some time off from Girls United.
Can you?
No.
Hey, man, what's up?
I ha a big math test tomorrow.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'actually pretty good at math, so if you want some help...
Can you just shut up so I can study, please?
Sure.
Okay.
I just got a text on Brandon.
He's gonna stay in Idyllwild tonight.
Good.
Give him time to cool down.
What's that?
The video surveillance from the pharmacy.
That was fast.
Everything's on computer these days.
All you need is an access code.
It's amazing anyone gets away with anything now,
with all the cameras everywhere.
My hunch is that the driver came in
to get bandages or some stuff for first aid.
I'm hoping to get a visual I.D.
Does it bother you that the kid know we're having problems?
We're not having problems.
It's good for them to see that couples fight.
They're fine. We're fine.
You want to go to the beach later?
I don't... I don't think I can.
Oh, okay. Well, we don't have to go to the beach.
We can do something else.
All right. Everyone, take your seats.
Turn over your papers and begin.
Jude, excuse me?
30 minutes. I don't think it's gonna be enough time.
Uh, sorry.
Jude, Jude, what are you doing?
Why aren't you taking your math test?
I don't feel like it.
Well, I'm sorry you don't feel like it,
but you have to take the test, or you'll fail.
I don't care if I fail.
Well, you should.
Why?
Why should I care about some stupid math test
when Callie's back in the system
and you and mom are getting a divorce?
Why should I care about anything?
Jude. Jude.
You know he's just acting out.
He's a teenager.
For the record, Stef and I are not getting a divorce.
We're just going through a little rough patch.
We started couples counseling. Except now Stef doesn't want to go.
With five kids... Sorry, make that six...
It's hard to make us a priority.
Well, if you don't, you risk waking up one day
and realizing there's no "us" left.
I know. I just don't know how to get Stef to see that.
Don't divorce off the table.
What I mean is, sometimes people think
They can neglect the relationship
because "We're married with kids, we're never breaking up."
But it's not okay to be unhappy.
You're right.
I'm not happy and I need to tell her.
Can I talk to Callie?
Cal.
What are you doing here?
I messed up really bad.
I walked out of my math test.
I just got up and left.
Then I yelled at Lena.
I don't want to go home.
Why not?
Are you afraid or something,
'cause you yelled?
Jude, I've put them through way worse.
What do you think they're gonna do to me?
Every kid says mean things to their parents, Jude.
Not kids like us.
You can't be afraid to speak up,
or mess up even.
I mean, I get it. We're all the same...
every foster kid.
We think we're not allowed
to say what we need or to stand up for ourselves.
But we have to, okay? And that includes you.
Could I say something?
Jude, you know,
Parent an't love you more
because you're biologically theirs.
I mean, you moms... they don't love you
because you're easy to deal with
or because you keep your mouth shut.
They love you because you're you.
Our moms are splitting up.
Why would you say that?
I overheard them and Brandon fighting.
He said they were having problems and going to couples therapy.
That doesn't mean they're goona split up though.
I mean, is that what they were fighting about?
No, they were fighting about you and A.J.
So what um... what did they say to Brandon?
That they caught you kissing.
Why do you keep doing this?
Hey, I am so sorry I yelled you.
Do you think I can retake my math test?
Apology accepted,
But that will be up to your teacher, love.
We're just glad that you're okay, sweetheart.
We love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, what...?
You didn't answer any of my texts.
Sorry.
Excuse me. I have to take this.
Are you sure you're okay? Really?
'cause we were worried, you know?
Yeah.
What's going on?
Jude had a rough day.
Sorry to hear about that, buddy.
Callie, there's a situation at Girls United.
I'm sorry, we have to go.
Bye.
That was very sweet... what you said to Jude.
You know, I know you haven't exactly had the best day yourself.
And seeing you be so kind and thoughtful
It has made me realize that
I think I have more compassion for my adopted kids than I do for you.
I just... I think um...
In my mind you haven't sufferd as much as they have.
You've had a stable home,
and parents that have loved you
and cared for you from the day you were born.
And that's um...that's not fair. It's not fair.
I know you've suffered. I know you've hurt.
And I know that things aren't just great
just because you have us.
We weren't there for you about Callie.
I see now that your heart was broken.
And I should have been there.
I should have been more understanding.
I just always expect you to do the right thing.
Because you just... you always do, B.
And I'm sorry.
You've always been so warm and welcoming
to all the kids that we've brought in this house.
It just never occurred to me that you might not actually be okay.
If you don't want your father to foster A.J.,
I think you need to say something.
You have that right.
And I'll support you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love you, mom.
I love you.
Carmen and Brooke have been at each other's throats all day.
I sent them up to their rooms.
Are you kidding me?
Damn it. Keep the girls down here.
Okay, that's enough. Brooke, downstairs now.
Carmen stop!
I said enough! I mean that Carmen.
Get out of my face, bitch!
Oh my God.
Michelle, take Carmen and get some ice.
Brooke, get to your room right now.
We're gonna have to call the police.
Can we call Stef?
Yeah.
So what happened?
Brooke and me were in a fight.
And Rita came upstairs.
And?
And she tried to break it up.
And then she hit me.
Brooke?
No. Rita.
I never laid a hand on her.
It's true. Rita punched her in the face.
I know what you must be thinking.
I'm not.
I did not hit Carmen.
I know that.
Ma'am, we have to cuff you.
Is that really necessary?
Yes, Callie. It's the law.
I'm gonna take Brooke down to the station, get her statement.
And I'll bring Carmen as soon as I take her to the E.R. to get checked out.
Callie, go get your stuff.
No, I'm staying here.
What? No, no, you're not staying here.
Well, obviously, I can't stay at Rita's, and I'd rather stay here.
Hey, given what just happened, there is no way...
Kiara and Daphne have my back.
The last time I was put in a random foster home,
the woman locked me in a room.
Fine. I will call your social worker.
You keep your cell phone on you.
You do not let anyone know that you have it.
And at the first sign of trouble, you call me, yes?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't even hear you come home.
Hey.
How did it go?
The girls are sticking to their story that Rita hit Carmen.
Rita was released for the night,
but looks like she'll be charged with assault.
I don't believe it. They have to be lying.
I don't know. Rita's under a lot of pressure.
Can't be easy dealing with those girls.
I just... I think sometimes people lose their tempers and snap.
No, I don't think that Rita's even capable of that. Do you?
I...I think we're all capable of doing things that we never thought we'd do.
Think you're looking for a needle in a haystack there?
Maybe.
But maybe not.
That's Joe Olsen...
The son of the owner of the S.U.V. that hit the kids.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I interviewed him.
Well, I thought they said they reported the car stolen.
Yeah, the day after the accident.
I never bought that. Okay.
They didt find his fingerprints in the car though.
But didn't you say the guy on the bus was black?
Yeah, but this Joe Olsen
shows up in this pharmacy 40 minutes after the accident?
I'm sorry, but that's not coincidence.
I wanted to take this opportunity tell you my story.
Callie?
So my little brother and I
have been in seven different foster homes.
And in one home I was raped
by an older foster brother,
Liam Olmstead.
And then there was this other home
And we had this foster dad... Jim Pearson.
And one day he was beating my little brother so bad,
I had to take a baseball bat to his car
to get him to stop.
Nothing happened to him. I went to juvie.
After that, I ended up in a safe,
loving foster home.
And my foster moms adopted my little brother,
but the judge wouldn't allow them to adopt me.
And the same judge,
Judge Jeffrey Ringer,
continues to block my adoption whitout considering what I want.
And that is what is wrong with the system.
We foster kids have no control over our own lives,
and it is time that we speak up
and we starting calling people out by name.
That is the only way that things will change.
And we cannot be afraid.
And that is why I'm telling my story
and I... I...
I really hope that you'll tell yours.
What is this?
Callie ask me to upload to her web app.
Should she be saying those things?
I don't think you should post it.
It's too late. And OK, she already got, like, 30 views.
