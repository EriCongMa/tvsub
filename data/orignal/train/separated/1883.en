So there's this bird--
some sort of swallow, I think.
Where are we with Avery?
Holding offers from USC.,
Penn, Tulane and Emory.
Tulane and Emory are in love. They want him bad.
Every september, thousands of 'em ditch rainy Seattle
to winter in Mexico.
Grey?
These birds aren't dumb.
Uh, still between Boston and Seattle.
If I'm gonna lose one of my talented residents
and my top neurosurgeon,
I'd love a decision sooner than later.
You and me both, Hunt.
Yang?
Well, she didn't tell you?
Uh, Stanford and Columbia are playing hardball,
but I'm confident that we're still in the mix.
And every year, crowds of people gather around Seattle
to drink beer and watch the flocks take off.
Lee, Steinman, and Renaldo?
Offer from Rice.
Leaning toward Wash U.
Baylor and San Diego are both after him.
They call it the great migration.
Well, Karev is staying.
If we are out this many surgeons,
I'm gonna need to hire now.
So let's get answers from our people as soon as possible.
Thank you.
And let's not forget that we've agreed to assist
Boise Memorial with their conjoined twin surgery,
so make sure your teams are ready to leave from the lobby
no later than 10:00 tomorrow night.
You should be proud.
You trained these kids well.
You should be proud. You trained 'em.
Yeah.
I sure did.
We passed our boards!
We killed the boards!
I just think it's weird
that we're not even talking about it,
you know, things are unresolved here.
We're still friends.
It's all good, Jackman.
I love this song!
Excuse me.
Kepner's wasted. That's a first.
Yeah, well, lately she's been all about...
firsts.
Excuse me.
This is Dr. Yang.
Well, that does certainly give me a lot to think about.
Thank you so much for calling.
Mayo wants to give me a research lab.
Guess who's back in the running!
Yeah, Cristina!
April!
So that's what rock bottom looks like.
Music. Music.
Hello.
Uh, yes, this is she.
Okay.
Well, yes, thank you. Thank you.
Um, thank you so much for the opportunity.
U.V.A. wants a board-certified surgeon
so they pulled my offer.
Come on. Music. Come on.
Come on.
Music! Come on!
Cristina?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Are you drunk?
I don't know.
We got one whole day.
Tuck's with his dad. I think we should make the most of it--
Sargent exhibit at the art museum,
Pike place,
maybe watch the sunset over the water.
12 whole hours to get to know the city that you have lived in
for the past ten years but still have yet to s--
No. No, no, no, no, no. You are supposed to be naked.
Okay, well, the--the hospital just called.
A-a stomach perf with intestinal obstruction
and an enlarged liver.
They don't know what's causing it.
Uh, uh, could be fun. You want to come?
So how much longer do I have?
Don't tiptoe around. Just give it to me straight.
Jake, you're not dying. He can be a little neurotic.
Uh, we're hoping we'll be able to figure out more
during your surgery.
Well, do you think it's something
that I-I picked up abroad, like Ebola or something?
We were just on our honeymoon.
You two just got married?
You seem like you've been together a while.
It's our third in 12 years honeymoon.
We went to Kauai the first time.
Oh, beautiful.
Yeah, then we got divorced.
Then we went to Fiji the next time.
The beaches.
Yeah, and then we got divorced.
This time, my bride,
she insisted on Thailand.
We just can't seem to stay way from each other.
Con-- Congratulations.
So this patch here is your tumor.
It's invading the wall of your right ventricle.
What we'll do is, uh, we'll resect the tumor,
then repair the ventricle,
and replace the tricuspid valve.
Dr. Yang is the best that we have.
Y-You couldn't be in better hands.
Come on.
Where is she?
Arizona? She's, um...
Patients.
So... so many patients.
So, um, basically,
you all want to chop up my heart into a jigsaw puzzle.
It may give me a few more months,
most of which, I'll be spending in a hospital bed,
while my best friend in the world
does everything possible to avoid me?
Or I spend the rest of my short life
lying on a sandy beach in Belize.
Nick, you need this surgery--
Tell Scottsdale I said good-bye.
Looks like I won't get the chance.
Hunt needs to know where we are on Boston,
and I gotta let Harvard know
what I'm doing by the end of the day.
We're not going. Anything else you need to know?
You know, I may have told you, I have family on the east coast.
A couple of times.
And I may have replied that my sister lives here.
And if Cristina chooses Stanford,
it's a 2-hour plane ride.
But if she chooses Columbia,
it's only a 2-hour train ride.
We're not going.
They want me to run
the entire neurosurgery department at Harvard.
Webber loves me, and Bailey loves me.
I will be teaching the best fellows in the world.
We are staying.
We're leaving.
Here you go, Apes.
I was thinking I could take the trauma rooms,
and, uh, we could split the beds.
I can handle trauma, Alex.
It was one phone call.
It doesn't mean I can't practice medicine.
I still have three great hospitals who want me.
Of course they do, Apes.
Don't call me Apes.
Karev, come here.
You're gonna get a phone call in a few minutes,
and not just any phone call.
It's from Keith Collier.
I don't know any Keith Colliers.
He was one of your examiners at the boards.
Oh, crap. I failed, didn't I?
They changed their minds. Son of a--
Karev, Karev,
Keith is a good friend of mine.
Now whatever you told him at the boards
really impressed him.
I mean, really impressed him.
He wants to offer you a peds surgery fellowship
at Hopkins.
Hopkins has the best program in the country.
They've already chosen their fellows for next year.
Which is what makes this so extraordinary.
They're adding a position just for Karev.
This is you playing some kind of practical joke,
then at the end, you're gonna tell me I learned something
when I really haven't.
I-I am not joking.
I have no skin in this game.
Hopkins is the dream.
I know.
It's really not cool to screw with somebody's head like this.
You know that.
I know.
Make sure your ringer's on.
He's full of crap.
I don't think so.
I'm over this.
Cristina, I made a decision.
Oh, you have?
You're going to Stanford.
Oh, you've made my decision.
There's no way you're going to Columbia.
And Mayo's in Minnesota. Please.
和斯坦福所在的加州都很远
And since we're staying here,
Stanford's only a couple of hours away.
You'll come up. I'll bring Zola down.
We can get drunk on the weekends.
Okay, well, maybe I shouldn't bring Zola.
Hey! There you are.
Is there anything you want to go over on the conjoined twins
before you head out to Boise?
No. I'm...I'm good.
You sure? 'cause you're gonna be
the sole cardiothoracic surgeon representing Seattle Grace.
Which, I mean, you know, is kind of unheard of
for an attending to allow her fellow to do.
But that's just the kind of faith I have in you.
Technically, I'm not a fellow yet.
I know. Right?
I mean, so just think about all the things
that you're gonna be able to do when you are.
Tip of the iceberg, Yang. I'm proud of you.
You haven't even told her you're leaving?
I haven't decided yet where I'm going.
You just did.
Stanford.
Hopkins!
Hopkins is not in the running.
Not for you. For me. Hopkins.
Hopkins wants me.
Hopkins wants me.
Johns Hopkins, the hospital?
Alex, how?
Not Hopkins refrigeration school?
I kinda bitched out their chief of surgery, at my boards,
and I...I...I guess he was impressed.
So they know you're a jerk?
They totally know,
and they want me.
Hopkins wants me.
I'm not surprised at all.
I am 100% surprised.
Nice work, Evil Spawn.
Yes!
Hopkins!
The stomach's adhered to the bowel,
and look at the size of this liver.
You know, this is one for the record book.
We should be taking pictures.
Oh, we really should.
Sure. Let's take a break.
Wait for someone could find a camera.
We got all the time in the world.
We do have all the time in the world.
This is my only case today.
Because it's your day off.
I'll have another day off.
I made a lunch reservation.
I even brought the crossword.
We could skip the crossword for one week.
That's not right.
What in the name of chickens is going on here?
Is it Crohn's disease?
Maybe it's just a mystery.
Maybe Lee Harvey Oswald's magic bullet's been dancing around
in Mr. Steiner's intestines for 50 years.
Sometimes we just never figure it out.
You marvel at the wonder of it all while you sew 'em up,
and you go eat lunch.
Is it a metabolic syndrome?
Oh, maybe it's autoimmune.
What did you tell Keith?
Finish up.
Yes, sir.
I told him I needed a day or two to think about it.
You know, I made a commitment to Robbins.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm freaking out.
What's Hopkins giving salary-wise?
It's competitive.
They throw in a loan-repayment package, moving expenses?
You did the whole Africa thing.
Tell me you at least asked for an international rotation.
Oh, Karev.
Look, it's not like I have any leverage.
And these are two of the best programs in the country.
Who both want you.
And now's the time to shake 'em down.
I mean, pit 'em against each other.
You call Hopkins back and tell 'em what you want,
and then get Hunt's ass down here
and give him the same demands.
What if he doesn't want to play ball?
I mean, if he doesn't have the money,
He doesn't have the money.
Oh, he has the money.
And when he lies and says that he doesn't have the money,
and he will lie...
You're not doing your job as the chief if you don't lie...
You tell him you know about his incidentals and overhead fund.
Incidentals and overhead fund.
Exactly.
You say those four little words,
and I promise...
the kingdom will be yours.
How's Julia? You impregnate her yet?
No, I was all ready to, but then Lexie...
She told me she was in love with me.
What did you say?
I said, "Thank you for your candor."
"Thank you for your candor"?
What was I supposed to do?
Oh, I don't know... kiss her.
Julia's away on a conference. I'm not a cheater.
Usually.
Look, I owe it to the both of them to...
I don't want to mess this one up, okay?
Julia wants to give me everything I want.
But I'm in love with Lexie, who doesn't want anything I want.
Dr. Shepherd.
Dr. Sloan.
Lexie, come on in.
Oh, uh...
Plenty of room.
You know, actually, I was just gonna update you
on the Boise doctors' bios, but since you're both here,
I'm just gonna give it to you, and then that way, I can...
leave.
Oh, uh, no. Oh, sorry. You guys go. I'm gonna stay.
Oh, hey, Lexie, about that other thing,
don't think I forgot what you said.
I just need to ruminate on that... ah.
You know? Run it up the old flagpole?
Okay.
You know, it's too bad Meredith and I are moving to Boston.
I'm gonna miss this.
Hey, you got a second?
'cause I cannot figure out what to do about Tulane,
and there's this whole other thing
that happened at the boards.
I mean, it's all kinda thrown me for a loop.
Aw. Look at that. She's cute.
Must be nice in here with all these cute little babies.
Yeah.
Is she dying, like, right now?
'Cause Nick is.
Remember Nick, your brother's best friend,
your rock, who is right now packing up
and bailing on a surgery that he needs to live
because you can't get your stubborn head out of your ass
and let go of the fact that he didn't come to you sooner?
Callie, I--
No, I-I don't get it.
You watch babies die every day.
When things looked bad for me, you didn't leave my side.
And now your best friend's asking for you.
Look, you need to get your crap together
before he leaves,
because if he goes now, he is gone.
She's not actually dying, is she?
No.
Okay, good.
You said you'd know more once you got in there.
We hoped we'd know more.
Unfortunately, we weren't able to find the cause.
But the good news is, we were able to repair
all the damage to your abdomen.
Well, what's the point if you don't know what's doing it?
Something is eating my insides.
Maybe it's stress, you know?
You're so worried about the worst-case scenario,
you finally made it happen.
Okay, coral can poison you. That's a known fact.
And look at you. I told you not to pet those monkeys.
What? It's a rash. It's not from the monkeys.
Would you please take a look at her arm?
It's been there for weeks.
Let me see. Uh, where did you say you honeymooned again?
Thailand.
You know, where pigs walk around inside restaurants.
It's called local color.
It's unsanitary.
Life is unsanitary.
That's what makes it fun, for god sakes.
Mrs. Steiner, please hold still.
Oh, what is this here?
Is that--
Right there--
That's...
a worm.
Good news.
I think we found what's eating your insides.
The nasty critter?
Raw fish?
Sushi in Thailand from a train station.
I'm looking for more damage. Want to help?
No. I'm gonna cancel our lunch reservation.
Oh, are you really still moping about lunch?
I had a plan.
We had a day.
Ben, there is a gnathostoma worm
in this man's body.
These things eat through the viscera,
migrate through the tissue.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime parasite.
I'm sorry if I find it
a little more interesting right now
than the crossword and garden salad.
The patient is on antiparasitics.
The worm is going to die.
Wh-- there's nothing else you can do right now
other than go to lunch.
This is not like one of your movies
where--where--where the larvae gestate in the brain,
leaving the poor host a hollowed-out zombie
whose bite will now infect the whole populous on the base.
What movie is that?
What?
No, that sounds good. I haven't seen it.
I made it up.
Oh, man!
Okay, let's see now. There's...
Man.
You made a commitment.
Technically, that was a verbal agreement.
I never signed a contract.
I would like to think that your word is as good as a contract.
N-n-normally, yeah.
But... this is Hopkins.
I just think you should know what they're offering me.
Oh, really, like what?
Like, uh, m-moving expenses.
You live here.
True.
But this is the extra dough
that Hopkins was willing to offer.
I'm just asking you to add that on to my new salary.
Karev,
even if I wanted to, I couldn't.
That budget is already set.
We don't have the dough. Okay?
Maybe you should recheck that budget.
You know, see what you got lying around in your...
incidentals and overhead fund.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I-I think you do.
Oh, we can add Spaghetti Wednesday
to the list of things I'm not gonna miss about this place.
Are you kidding? Best deal in town.
I've watched Alex go through six bowls already.
True that.
Hey, I hear Stanford has a farm-to-table chef.
You can text your order right from the O.R.
Well, I'll factor that in. I still haven't made my decision.
Well, it's gotta be Stanford. Where else would you go?
I don't know. I might stay.
Everything's on the table.
She likes the spaghetti, too.
Tulane's got crawfish.
I mean, that's a selling point.
U.S.C., I mean, what-- what do they eat in L.A.?
Souls.
2-1-2. It's New York.
Mount Sinai.
Answer it.
Bad news is only bad news if you pick up the phone.
April Kepner speaking.
Cristina.
Oh, really?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh. Okay.
No, no, no, no.
No, thank you.
They--they didn't pull my offer?
Oh, no. They did.
I just figured that's what you'd sound like
in the face of rejection.
Hey, you want my fries, Apes?
Not if they're pity fries.
I tasted the sample.
No, you still got Case Western and Seattle, right?
You're gonna be... fine.
So what does Sloan think about Tulane?
He hasn't weighed in one way or the other.
There's something wrong with him.
I think he's disturbed or something.
Then again, I've been pretty disturbed myself these days.
2-1-6.
Cleveland.
Maybe Case Western's offering loan assistance.
This is Kepner.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know what? I am an awesome surgeon.
And I would've rocked your stupid little program
so it is your loss. Go to hell!
Where are you going?
Belize.
You're going to have the surgery.
Why, so I can get a few more months
of pain and suffering?
So you can live, and then you'll have radiation,
or we'll get you in a clinical trial.
Oh, now you have an opinion, doctor?
After you've been M.I.A. for three days?
I've been a little busy, Nick. I--
Look, I get that this is scary for you.
I really do.
But it kinda sucks for me, too.
They're telling me I'm riddled with cancer,
and I'm completely alone.
Where's your sister? Did--did you call your sister?
You're the one that's supposed to be here.
You're the one who's supposed to have my back through all this.
And you're nowhere! You're gone!
I have your back!
Then have it!
Please...
Please... have the surgery.
It'll work.
And I'll be here.
I'll be here.
I promise.
Damn, Phoenix.
Things a guy has to do to get your attention.
I love the fireplace, the stonework.
You hated it a month ago.
And the windows.
These views are amazing. You are a genius.
I will build you a dream house in Boston.
What will we do with this one?
Mark will buy it.
His dreams have always been my dreams.
Harvard is offering me a $10 million endowment.
They're setting me up with an entire research team.
I'm gonna cure Alzheimer's, Meredith.
That's my dream.
Not this house.
You're making this choice with Cristina.
She's not the only factor.
I'm your husband.
You should make it with me.
So I didn't see any further damage
from the parasite on your scans.
That's great, but you can't just
leave a worm inside of him forever.
This thing has teeth. You have to get it out of me, please.
You know, I have a worm inside of me, too,
but you don't hear me crying about it.
Yours is in your arm, and they're taking it out today.
Mine could be anywhere.
Oh, my god. My penis.
It's not gonna get to your -- it doesn't do that, does it?
My legs.
Okay, well, which is it your legs or your penis?
No, I'm serious. I can't feel my legs or my arms.
It's -- it's weird. It's all going numb.
What?
Can you move your toes?
What about your fingers?
No.
Shoot.
Okay.
Can you feel that?
Barely.
What's wrong? What's happening to him?
Page Shepherd.
Right away, doctor.
Well, the thing's gnawed through all the discs.
C-3 to c-5 are all inflamed.
So it's in there.
The worm's in his cervical spine,
nesting, waiting.
So there's a chance of paralysis.
Complete paralysis. I need to get in there quick.
Otherwise, he's gonna be a quadriplegic.
Go. I'm going in with you. I'm on your six.
I'll get him prepped. Lock and load, people.
She's on your what?
I have no idea.
Okay, dealer's choice.
Do you want to do the ventriculoplasty
or resect the tumor
or...
Do you want to be primary surgeon?
Fine.
Fine?
Okay, what is going on?
Are you staying? Are you going?
'Cause it-it's driving me crazy. I-I don't...
If it has to do with Owen, whatever it is,
I am sure the two of you can fix it.
I'll take all of it.
What? All of it --
The ventriculoplasty
and as much of the tumor as you'll let me do.
Thank you. It's very generous.
I'll see you in there.
Okay, Marion,
the ultrasound shows
the worm went deeper into your tissue
but we should still be able to get that nasty thing out.
Jake could die
or he could be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I'm the one that insisted we go to Thailand.
I keep trying to turn him into somebody else.
Maybe we made a mistake.
What do you mean exactly?
How do you know it was a mistake?
I don't know why we keep coming back to each other.
We're the same people,
but we keep expecting a different outcome.
Isn't that the definition of insanity?
Or love.
If there's a spark, there's a spark.
Or maybe you think there's a spark,
but it just happened once, so you can't really tell,
and there's no time to actually figure that out
because you're probably moving halfway across the country.
Are we gonna get this worm out any time soon?
Yeah. Get the irrigation ready.
Right. On it.
C-3 and C-4 are just a mess.
I'm gonna have to go further in here than I expected.
You might as well go all the way to C-5.
I mean, from the look of this lesion,
that's where the bastard set up his hive.
I don't want it to be any more invasive
than it has to be.
Don't argue with her.
She's starring in her own sci-fi movie.
You mess with her, she'll pull out her ray gun
and atomize your ass.
And he's still pouting. You're a physician.
Is this really the first time you missed a lunch
and the crossword because of a surgery?
Here we go.
It was important to me.
Well, this parasite's important to me.
Yeah, I can see that.
You know what?
Fine. Let's do it right now. Give me the damn crossword.
Just forget it.
Oh, no. Nobody's ever gonna forget it.
Where is Dr. Warren's bag?
Miranda...
Oh, there it is.
And this is why you don't work with your girlfriend.
I warned them.
Here we go. Oh, this is gonna be so great.
It's way better than a once-in-a-lifetime,
bone-eating parasite.
Let's see. One down.
Dr. Bailey--
Oh, no, no, no.
No help from you. I'm too excited.
This is what I live for.
Let's see "Peruvian mountain range."
Oh, Andes. Five, uh-huh.
"Planet with water, four letters."
Oh, Mars. Duh. Uh, "Fancy sauce"?
Fancy... ooh.
Remoulade.
Stop.
What? No, no. I'm on a roll. Come on.
Hey, this can't be the Sunday, 'cause this is way too easy.
What's--oh, hey, this one, 21 across.
"My question to you." Hmm.
I'm asking you to put it away.
He's asking you nicely, Dr. Bailey.
Oh, no, no, no. When he doesn't get his way,
he holds on to it in his cheek like a squirrel with a nut.
We are doing the crossword.
What is "My question to you"?
It's a bunch of letters.
Um... oh, maybe it's a phrase.
"My question to you," Anybody?
How many letters?
Uh, 2... 9... 13.
It's 13 letters?
14.
No, I'm looking at it. It's 13.
No, it's 14. Count again.
I just counted.
What, do you have X-ray vision from across the room?
"Will you marry me"
Is my question to you.
And the reason why it's so easy
is because I made the crossword.
Took me two damn months
not to mention getting a mockup made of <i>The New York Times.</i>
The phrase has 14 letters.
"Will," Four, "You," Seven,
"Marry," 12, "Me..."
14.
Got it.
It was in C-4.
All right, temp's down to 30 degrees.
Cross-clamping the aorta.
All right. Let's see what we're working with.
Damn it.
This wasn't in the scans.
The tumor's infiltrated much deeper into the ventricle.
Reconstructive ventriculoplasty
isn't gonna cut it.
We could do a Fontan?
Directly sew the right atrium to the pulmonary artery.
We could patch whatever's left.
That would help with blood flow,
but the hole in the resection would--
Yeah. He--he'd arrest right on the table.
We could do an R.V. to a P.A. conduit--
No, the thing would calcify. It would kill him.
A cadaver homograft?
Uh, the hole would be way too big.
It's instant heart failure.
They don't know what to do, Callie.
They have no idea.
No, it's--it's Altman and Yang, okay?
They'll figure something out.
They're gonna figure something out.
Come on, guys. Come on.
Hey.
Sedona.
How's my ticker?
Cancer free?
The tumor had taken over your heart,
and there was no good way to get it out so...
they had to close up.
But I thought...
you said it was my best shot.
It was.
So...
I guess I'm going to Belize.
Yeah.
Stupid.
I'm so freakin'...
Why didn't I come sooner?
Why didn't I come...
Oh, my god.
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.
No. No.
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.
I-I think we're gonna lose Yang.
Owen, what happened? Please tell me.
'Cause I-I have tried everything
short of offering her my own job.
I mean, I've sang, I've--I've danced, I've--
I slept with someone else.
So...
There's nothing that you could've done.
She's not leaving you.
She's leaving me.
I'm sorry.
Hopkins didn't pull the offer, did they?
They, uh, gave me the international rotation
and the moving expenses,
and they took care of, uh,
all my loans-- college, med school.
They're even throwing in a mortgage allowance.
I could buy a house.
Good.
They gave me everything I asked for.
So did Hunt.
Then...
why the hell aren't you celebrating?
No one's ever wanted me like this.
You just don't recognize the view, Karev...
The crowd going wild,
people taking pictures,
the snap of the tape as you break it.
What are you talking about?
What it looks like when you finish first.
Chief, you paged?
Yeah. Uh...
I can't hire you next year, Kepner.
I-- i'm--I'm--I'm taking my boards again.
You know, I'll--I'll pass this time.
You--you don't have to worry about that--
It's not just about the boards.
I've had to do some last-minute rejiggering of my budget,
and I just don't have the money--
This is a top-ranking hospital. There's always money.
I-I-I can help you find it.
I'm really good with budgets.
Chief...
I have nothing left.
Seattle Grace was my last option.
You're not the best candidate
for the job anymore.
I am sorry.
They're conjoined at the sternum and the diaphragm.
It's tricky.
I can handle it.
So Seattle's still in the mix.
That's a surprise.
Because of Owen?
Cristina, he should be with someone who wants a baby.
And you should be with someone who wants you.
You know what?
You and everyone else needs to just...
shut up about it.
It's a huge decision.
And I don't want you doing the wrong thing.
It is not your decision to make.
I am your person.
We're not married. You're not my...
He's my person.
Hey. I just checked in on him.
His vitals are stable.
He's sleeping.
Don't ever leave.
What?
Don't... ever leave.
I'm not going anywhere. I promise.
Promise me that right now.
After my brother...
I thought, I can't do this ever again.
I won't... do this again.
And now here I am.
Okay, whatever you can't do, I will.
I'm here.
And that's how this works, okay?
Come here.
So what's it gonna be,
Columbia, Stanford?
I hear that Mayo is back in the mix.
You know, really, you-- you can't go wrong
with any of them, so...
What--what are you-- what are you doing?
Propose to me again.
Baby, you should sit down.
Propose to me...
again.
I mean, you-- you look...
Miranda, I would love nothing more than that,
but I'm telling you, you should--
Oh, for the love of god, man, I'm--I'm--I'm sorry
I messed up your proposal, but...
I'm wearing a thong,
and this is as sorry as I get, so...
come on. Ask me to marry you.
Okay, look, th-there was the shooting, right?
And then you and I broke up,
and I-I just-- I wanted to get outta here,
to do something different, something...
inspiring.
I-I just...
didn't think it would actually happen.
I got a call, and...
I've been accepted as a surgical intern
at U.C.L.A..
An intern, Miranda,
working seven days a week...
1,000 miles away.
Everything's different now.
What?
I'm happy.
I know...
this doesn't fix anything...
But I'm just happy.
I'm leaving.
You got that? Is it too heavy for you?
No, I'm--I'm fine,
but thank you.
No, uh, thank you.
You son of a bitch. I had to hear it from Hunt?
What, you couldn't even
be man enough to tell me yourself?
Sweetie.
She's had a horrible day. I'm so s--
No, you ungrateful crap dog!
It's Hopkins. You went there.
You of all people should know that.
You are a miserable, miserable bastard.
Robbins, they want me.
All right? They really want me.
Well, you...
you're actually going?
Can we talk about this when I get back?
No!
What are you doing?
No, you are not going to Boise,
because you no longer represent this hospital!
Oh, give me a break...
Look at Alex, showing us all up by going to Hopkins.
If Robbins lets him live that long.
Fine. You know what? Forget the charts.
Forget the charts. Go see if they need help in the clinic.
I'm going to Boston.
I told Hunt.
I've been prepping for this surgery for days!
I'm going to Mayo.
I don't know how those birds do it...
travel thousands of miles without getting lost...
banging into windows,
being eaten by cats.
All right, let's get you some water, okay?
Oh... let's get you some water.
You know, I'm so sick of everyone
being so damn nice to me.
You just feel guilty...
April--
for having sex with me...
Oh, no, come on. That is not--
and then I failed...
I-I am messed up right now. And now no one wants me.
What?
Oh, crap. Even Seattle?
I don't want your pity, okay?!
Can you just leave me alone?
Can you do that? I'm--I'm fine. I'm fine.
Okay.
I'm gonna be fine, Jackson.
All right.
I'm gon--I'm...
April, April...
But every spring,
they're always here.
I guess they come back to what they know.
People say it's pretty cool
watching them go.
They say you can actually see the moment...
when, at some mysterious signal...
all at once...
the birds decide to leave.
So maybe I've been missing out.
Whatever.
