okay , so we got two with the quinoa base ,
basil , cheddar , topped with a poached egg
and slathered with secret sauce , right ?
yes . okay .
coming right up .
people love your food , holden .
can &apos;t keep your secret sauce in stock , man .
it &apos;s your secret sauce .
i &apos;m happy to put your photo on the label .
ah , it wouldn &apos;t sell without your pretty face , dude .
hey , one thing you should think about , though , is another truck .
i &apos;d rather stay small .
keep it 100 % clean , organic food .
you know my motto -- &quot; hell no to gmo . &quot;
we should head back to the restaurant , chef .
can you swing by later so we can balance the truck &apos;s account ?
yeah , you got it .
you okay ?
yeah , um , i don &apos;t feel that well this morning .
oh , your stomach still jumping ?
uh , it &apos;s feeling worse , actually .
oh , well , let me take you home .
chef , are you all right ?
holden , what is it ?
reed , call 911 !
stay back !
holden ?
starting the day off tired ?
no .
you &apos;re yawning &apos; cause you skipped breakfast .
you didn &apos;t eat breakfast ?
no , i &apos;m yawning because you &apos;re boring .
you know , studies show that
yawning actually increases boredom .
hey ! i got the best news !
i passed !
you passed the plumbers &apos; apprenticeship exam ?
i didn &apos;t know you were studying to be a plumber .
tommy , that &apos;s great .
well , i only passed by one point .
yeah , but massachusetts has very rigorous standards .
that &apos;s a difficult exam .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
yeah , good job , bro .
all i got to do now is 550 hours of plumbing theory ,
1,700 hours of work credits ,
take the exam to be a journeyman plumber .
52 weeks after that , i &apos;ll be a master plumber .
you can &apos;t legally fix my toilet for three years ?
yeah , technically .
hey , frankie , you want to bring back
rizzoli and sons plumbing with me ?
thanks , bro , but i like the detective work .
all right , go ahead .
tell them your other good news .
and , you , i &apos;m gonna fix some eggs .
i &apos;m gonna ask lydia to marry me .
oh , tommy ! that &apos;s great !
oh , that &apos;s gonna be so nice for t.j.
yeah .
right , frankie ?
so nice for t.j.
yeah . who &apos;s that ?
excuse me .
so tell us how you &apos;re gonna propose .
excuse me .
hey , charlie .
hey , frankie .
gosh , i haven &apos;t seen you in forever .
yeah .
uh , this is my brother , tommy .
tommy , officer charlie hanson .
hi . charlie . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
i think tommy has inherited
my father &apos;s wandering eye .
that doesn &apos;t bode well for marriage .
it &apos;d be nice if frankie found someone .
although doesn &apos;t she seem a little young ?
maybe the rizzolis aren &apos;t cut out for marriage .
i mean , my engagement ring
is still sitting in a safety @-@ deposit box .
well , you shouldn &apos;t wait too long to make a decision about casey .
it &apos;s not healthy , jane .
i would love to sit here and process ,
but duty calls .
i remember when copley square
was just a couple of hotels .
now it &apos;s food truck central .
oh , my goodness ! is that chef holden ? !
who &apos;s chef holden ?
he &apos;s last season &apos;s &quot; america &apos;s best chef &quot; winner .
the reality show ?
he made the most inventive deconstructed pheasant normandy
from hearts of palm .
what happened to him ?
it &apos;s not clear .
those two were with him when he suddenly collapsed .
is that reed bennet and dalia reilly ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know that ?
well , i saw every episode .
me , too .
what did you think of chef holden &apos;s sous @-@ vide duck ?
oh , that technique was controversial .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;ve made the grilled watermelon
with the charred beef and fennel .
you &apos;re making me hungry .
can you two foodies stop salivating , please ?
what did the paramedics say ?
he was in full cardiac arrest when they got here .
couldn &apos;t resuscitate him .
what a shame .
you know , his name , holden , actually means &quot; kind . &quot;
he donated to every food @-@ activist group .
he put his money where his palate was .
he only served organic food .
he was perspiring heavily .
posterior nose bleed .
maura , are you smelling him ?
get everyone back !
maura , your nose is bleeding .
no , jane , get back !
call the hazmat team now !
folks , move back !
i need hazmat and critical @-@ incident @-@ response team
at copley plaza now .
my ekg is normal .
i &apos;m fine . thank you .
maura , i really think you should go to the hospital .
it &apos;s not necessary .
really , everybody that ate in the food truck didn &apos;t get sick .
even the paramedics that were treating him are fine .
you touched him with gloves . why did your nose bleed ?
you know , i likely became symptomatic
because i inhaled the toxin that was on his skin .
do you know what it is ?
no .
no .
i am not stripping down
and getting sprayed with the fire hose .
we brought a shower .
oh , so we can strip and shower there ?
we &apos;ll put up a screen .
take off your clothes and shoes now .
put them in these biohazard bags .
oh , man . this is a new suit .
these are my favorite shoes .
do you know what killed him ?
no , we haven &apos;t identified the toxin yet .
i &apos;ll do the autopsy .
no , maura , you can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll wear a full hazmat suit .
as soon as the body is
sealed and safe to be moved , we &apos;ll transport it .
please transport the food and the equipment from the truck , too .
i &apos;ll let my staff know to prepare for a biohazard .
are jane and maura okay ?
yeah , they &apos;re fine .
do you want some coffee ?
please .
the girls are changing in the car .
they didn &apos;t want to get caught dead in a paper jumpsuit .
i kind of like it . it &apos;s comfortable .
oh , no , no .
we &apos;re gonna drink this coffee and then go change in the gym .
maybe botulism killed chef holden .
i don &apos;t think so .
dr. isles said it had a distinct chemical smell ,
like maybe a cleaning product .
so maybe it wasn &apos;t a murder .
we have to investigate all suspicious deaths ,
and i &apos;m betting dollars
to doughnuts it &apos;ll turn out to be a homicide .
i watched all his episodes .
why would anybody want to murder that really cute tv chef ?
wow . congrats .
third kid . i can &apos;t even imagine .
you ought to try it , detective . babies are the best .
mm . hey , maura .
hey , frankie .
dr. isles , these were just delivered for you .
for me ? oh .
i wonder what it is .
the return address is a p.o. box in cypress .
did you order something from cypress ?
no .
well , the customs tag says &quot; collectibles . &quot;
i &apos;m not a collector , unless shoes count .
that didn &apos;t sound good .
uh , frankie , does a suspicious mail alert
say anything about excessive postage
or having a return address as a p.o. box ?
yeah , it says don &apos;t handle
and activate your emergency plan .
it doesn &apos;t say anything about a clicking noise if you pick it up .
i think it &apos;s a pressure switch .
okay , you should get out of the building .
you , too , officer jenkins . send the bomb squad in .
no .
initiate the evacuation procedure .
i &apos;m gonna put my hands over yours , okay ?
notify the bomb squad .
i &apos;m gonna help you maintain pressure .
thank you , frankie .
what &apos;s going on ?
you need to clear the building .
it &apos;s possible the package we &apos;re holding is an explosive device .
go outside and block the entrance , frost .
wait , if there was a bomb , wouldn &apos;t it have gone off
when it was handled by the post office ?
no , not necessarily .
if the sender knows that it &apos;s reached its destination ,
it could be remotely activated .
did anyone call about these packages ?
yeah , a few minutes ago to check to make sure they made it here .
i think i might have engaged the pressure switch .
so , what happens if you let go ?
it &apos;s like a land mine . you step on it --
when you lift your foot , it goes off .
will you go , frost ? !
you should go too , sergeant .
i &apos;m waiting for the bomb squad .
jenkins , you have a new baby . get .
korsak ...
would you get out ? ! that &apos;s an order ! go !
frost , get my mom out , too , will you ?
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
bomb tech is in position . all entrances are sealed off .
i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s only one bomb tech in there .
i just can &apos;t stand here .
come on , jane .
i @-@ i will tackle you to the ground if you take another step .
it &apos;s not a simple disposal , jane .
they can &apos;t use a robot , either .
i know , but it &apos;s frankie and maura in there .
that &apos;s a reassuring sound .
it means no radiation so far .
okay . i like that .
my arms are sore !
distract me .
uh ... tell me about your case .
that reality @-@ chef @-@ show guy really got poisoned ?
we don &apos;t yet have a cause of death .
wh @-@ what happens if you guess ?
well , i guess it &apos;s a little like if you were to wear a dress .
okay , i get it .
but there is something that &apos;s bothering me .
you mean other than this ?
why didn &apos;t the chef , who has a refined palate
and superior olfactory skills ,
smell the toxin that was covering his skin ?
maybe he had a cold .
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s wrong ?
come on , jane . stop watching that .
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t .
jane , give it to me .
what the hell ?
what are they doing ?
are they saying goodbye ?
so itchy .
yeah ? you got it ? mm @-@ hmm .
so if i go like this , you got it ?
that &apos;s good ?
okay .
finally . thank you , frankie .
it &apos;s a good thing my beard grows in fast .
i didn &apos;t ... scratch your skin , did i ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
the level of radiation
we &apos;re being exposed to isn &apos;t a health risk .
the level of radiation from an x @-@ ray
is the last thing i &apos;m worried about right now .
i really loved working on the cafe racer with you .
me , too .
me , too . i really --
i really enjoyed repairing the throttle valve .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna look , okay ?
yeah .
what is it ?
cylinders ,
stacks of metal containers ,
a circuit board . what --
there &apos;s some wiring .
&quot; kappa alpha . &quot;
oh , no .
what ? what is it ?
if the greek letters under these stamps
say &quot; phi iota sigma , &quot;
i think i know what &apos;s in the package .
you do ?
kaphis .
coffee . i ordered it .
you ordered it from cypress ?
no . amazon .
they sent me an e @-@ mail months ago from missouri .
they said they were on back
order looking for a new supplier . i forgot .
maybe -- maybe they fulfilled my order
with a -- with a company in cypress .
but that looks like a circuit board , and that &apos;s a wire .
i ordered a coffee maker , too .
it &apos;s probably the click that we heard .
the on @-@ off switch .
this is not an explosive device .
how much coffee did you buy ?
oh , my god .
a lot .
you guys can let go now .
okay .
oh , my gosh , i can &apos;t move my hands .
okay . ohh .
okay . there . okay .
i &apos;m so sorry for the trouble .
hey . it &apos;s okay .
this is gonna be something i never forget .
really ?
yeah .
okay .
oh , my god . ohh .
come here . come here . all right .
holden hathaway is a well @-@ nourished 32 @-@ year @-@ old male .
his blood work showed he was suffering
from hypoxemia with hypercapnia .
and that confirms what i &apos;m seeing in his otherwise healthy heart .
yes , i noticed something strange
about his otherwise healthy heart , too .
cause of death -- cardiac arrest
brought on by respiratory failure .
did he know he was nose @-@ to @-@ nose with such a dangerous toxin ,
and it might have a disastrous outcome to all who knew him ?
he was helping me with an uncomfortable sensation .
we &apos;re on speaker , maura .
it &apos;s all right .
if you &apos;re talking about coffee @-@ pot gate
and your brother playing twister with the medical examiner ,
everybody knows .
i had pruritus .
yes , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s dr. isles &apos; way
of saying she had an itch .
yes , pruritus , given the situation that i was in ,
could only be relieved with scratching .
toxins , dr. isles .
let &apos;s -- let &apos;s talk toxins .
well , based on the patterning of acute urticaria ,
cyanosis , cardiac arrest , and the odor that i detected ,
i had susie run tests for organophosphates on his skin .
i think i have it . it &apos;s dichlorvos .
what &apos;s dichlorvos ?
uh , it &apos;s a common organophosphate .
it &apos;s used in insecticides . it &apos;s a neurotoxin .
like bug spray ?
well , i can &apos;t confirm it was a spray .
but i can confirm that that &apos;s what killed him .
uh , do you have the results from the gcms on his clothing ?
uh , he &apos;s got traces on his pants and his shoes .
but the chef &apos;s coat he had on was just saturated with it .
the hazmat team is still processing the truck .
i &apos;ll have everything field @-@ tested .
okay , and i &apos;ll have csru check for it
in chef holden &apos;s restaurant , car , and home .
what are you doing down here ?
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d been promoted ... to my lieutenant .
you can &apos;t go in there .
what ? it &apos;s hazmat protocol .
i , uh ... need you to track down
chef holden &apos;s chef coats .
sure .
it was really brave of you to stay with maura
and hold that package .
it was coffee pods .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t know that .
frankie , is it possible that
a high @-@ stress situation has ...
intensified a ... crush ?
no .
you might as well know . i &apos;ve liked her for a long time .
you know she &apos;s practically family .
and you work together .
so ?
so you shouldn &apos;t mess around with people you work with .
it &apos;s pretty ironic that somebody
dosed chef holden with insecticide .
how ironic ?
well , he was all about organic foods , you know ?
no insecticides , no gmos in anything he served .
what &apos;s a gmo ?
wh @-@ what you &apos;re about to put in your mouth --
genetically modified organisms .
hey , do you think a cookie
made with this gmo stuff is safe to eat ?
mm , it &apos;s unclear .
the european union banned gmos ,
and there haven &apos;t been any long @-@ term safety studies .
maura , can you trace the insecticide
on his chef &apos;s coat by brand ?
no , dichlorovos has the same chemical structure
in every insecticide .
i &apos;ve been digging into chef holden &apos;s life .
did you locate any family members ?
yeah , his parents live in hong kong .
no girlfriend or wife .
what about these two chefs that were with him when he died ?
they met on &quot; america &apos;s best chef . &quot;
i &apos;ve been watching clips .
yeah , it was an extraordinary season ,
particularly the finale .
dalia , tell us about your finale dish .
i made a seared sweet bay scallop
with a horseradish beurre blanc .
grilled kale and fig ...
way to ruin perfectly good seafood .
reed , what about your dish ?
well , i love comfort food , so here &apos;s my twist .
fricassee of sweetbreads and oyster mushrooms
with mashed sunchokes .
nothing comforting about fricasseed sweetbreads
and sunchokes , if you ask me .
i &apos;ve made a deconstructed pheasant normandy
with onions , apples , peppercorn , apple brandy ...
what an astounding imagination .
this was a tough one for us .
not for me . i &apos;d send them
all home and order a pizza .
dalia , you are america &apos;s third @-@ best chef .
we all love your witty saporific take
on french nouvelle cuisine .
congratulations .
no wonder you like this show .
no one says &quot; awesome . &quot;
reed , you are america &apos;s second @-@ best chef .
that means that you , chef holden ,
are america &apos;s best chef .
so , they lose to holden , but they end up working for him ?
uh , chef holden won $ 150,000
to start his restaurant .
he brought dalia to help .
chef holden &apos;s farm to table .
it &apos;s impossible to even get a reservation .
&quot; the organic french farm @-@ style menu
is rife with amusing , inventive dishes
like a playful take on a mint and coconut soup . &quot;
maura .
oh , i would love to eat there .
all right , what about reed ? what &apos;s his story ?
the runner @-@ up , reed , didn &apos;t get famous .
he went back to his old job at a hotel .
holden hired him to run a food truck .
any indication dalia or reed weren &apos;t getting along with holden ?
oh , yeah . dalia and holden were a couple .
chefs are the new renaissance men .
they broke up when he got famous .
dalia posted this .
&quot; end @-@ of @-@ romance rage
makes me want to put a cockroach in his food . &quot;
maybe she decided holden was the cockroach .
and it was time to exterminate him .
yeah , we broke up , but we stayed friends .
we had a business to run .
we &apos;re gonna need to take his computer .
it &apos;s got all the records for the restaurant and the truck .
we &apos;ll get it back to you .
did you have any employees
who might have had an issue with their boss ?
no way . you couldn &apos;t not like the guy .
i lost to him , but he still became my best friend .
he was super @-@ cool and super @-@ generous .
he had a moral compass like i &apos;ve never seen .
we all wanted to be like him .
even when he was offered millions for his company ,
he wouldn &apos;t sell out -- i mean , who does that ?
were there any companies that didn &apos;t like
hearing the word &quot; no &quot; for an answer ?
only one i can think of is copley square foods .
they kept trying to schedule a meeting with him .
copley square foods . they &apos;re --
they &apos;re the biggest contributor to the anti @-@ gmo labeling lobby .
chef holden was an anti @-@ gmo activist .
he got us all on board with environmental issues .
he even spent his own money
to lease us all green cars .
even got me to use environmentally friendly wax on my car .
where did he keep his chef &apos;s coat ?
which one ?
how many does he have ?
dozens .
changed three or four times a night .
couldn &apos;t cook unless he had on a clean coat .
it was his lucky charm .
he had them everywhere --
home , car , truck , here .
okay , could you show us the ones you have here ?
excuse me .
hey , maura .
jane , i found something odd .
i couldn &apos;t understand why chef holden
couldn &apos;t detect the odor of the dichlorovos ,
but i &apos;m looking at medical records
from an e.r. visit six months ago .
his olfactory nerve was severed in a car accident .
isn &apos;t that connected to his ability to taste ?
yes .
so how could he get a five @-@ star review
after he lost his ability to taste ?
i don &apos;t think he did .
i think someone tasted for him .
detective rizzoli ,
can i talk to you for a minute ?
hey , hope , what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s about maura .
what , do you need another body part ?
she returned a gift .
it &apos;s ... my necklace , and it was meant for her .
you didn &apos;t give that to her .
your real daughter , cailin , did .
that &apos;s not fair .
you &apos;re the last person to talk to me about fair .
hope , you only show up when you want something , so spit it out .
what do you want this time ?
her forgiveness .
you just don &apos;t get it , do you ?
you made it very clear that it was pretty inconvenient for you
to find out that maura was still alive .
that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not ?
you told her she wasn &apos;t yours
and then accused her of scamming you .
well , i was --
it was shocking .
so was showing up again and asking her for a kidney .
be happy she has the decency to talk to you at all .
so many things i know i &apos;ve done wrong .
yes .
like standing by your man and treating his wounds
after he murdered lieutenant cavanaugh &apos;s wife and baby .
i told the grand jury everything .
i will be a key witness in the trial ,
and i will be the reason that paddy is put to death
if he &apos;s found guilty .
hope , for all we know , you made a deal .
i did not make a deal .
then why hasn &apos;t the i.r.s. closed down your m.e.n.d. clinics
and frozen all your assets ?
i turned over all the books .
the i.r.s. knows where to find me .
yeah , well , so does maura .
i need her forgiveness .
here &apos;s the pain you can &apos;t undo .
paddy is a gangster , and you &apos;re a liar .
it &apos;s not really the happy ending she was hoping for .
excuse me . i have a suspect to interview .
no one could know that he wasn &apos;t the chef
behind the restaurant , behind chef holden foods .
he was the name . holden was the brand .
and you , a classically trained chef ,
had to become his tasting beard .
i guess , if you want to put it that way .
well , it had to have been tough .
it wasn &apos;t ideal .
you were driving the car
that injured his olfactory nerve , weren &apos;t you ?
and you stayed and you cooked and you helped build his restaurant
because you felt responsible for his injury .
i was responsible .
was the crash deliberate ?
you called it an &quot; end @-@ of @-@ romance rage . &quot;
you sent that out right before the crash , didn &apos;t you ?
look , i was angry .
he broke up with me and then asked me for a ride home .
he said it wasn &apos;t working out as a couple
because of the restaurant .
when he didn &apos;t die in the car crash , did you try to poison him ?
no .
that &apos;s not what happened .
poison ?
i loved him .
i chose to stay behind
and help him with the restaurant .
after he dumped you .
i had to make peace just being near him .
it had to be enough .
we got to let dalia go .
we don &apos;t have anything to tie her
to the poison that killed holden .
i got 10 coats from the dry cleaners .
naturally clean &amp; bright .
just because they say they &apos;re eco @-@ friendly doesn &apos;t mean they are .
any trace of insecticides ?
no .
did you check the cleaners ?
csru went through the whole place .
they use natural insecticides --
onions , garlic , and cloves .
how many other chef &apos;s coats did you recover ?
10 clean , 7 dirty ones in his house ,
3 clean in his car , 4 in the truck .
and 5 from the restaurant .
the crime lab &apos;s still processing them all .
so far , nothing in his restaurant , home , or car
showed any trace of dichlorovos .
hazmat incident commander didn &apos;t find
any sign of insecticides in the food truck ,
so they released that , too .
so the only thing contaminated was a chef &apos;s coat
that only holden would wear .
what are you doing ?
i was thinking about chef holden &apos;s inability
to smell the organophosphate on his chef coat .
it &apos;s a subtle smell , but i can smell it .
you could sell a fart in new hampshire , maura .
look at these two bottles of his secret sauce .
that one &apos;s darker .
yes .
now ... taste them .
taste them ?
no , we &apos;re in the crime lab .
it &apos;s not very appetizing .
maur--
just just taste it .
it &apos;s good .
now try this one .
tastes the same .
if you &apos;re not a super @-@ taster , it does .
i think i &apos;ve just been insulted .
well , i did some dna sequencing .
and do you know what the secret ingredient is
in chef holden &apos;s secret sauce ?
ketchup .
saffron .
this sauce is $ 49 a bottle .
wh-- for hot sauce ? !
well , it &apos;s $ 5,000 a pound for saffron .
come -- that &apos;s not possible .
it takes up to 500 flowers to make one gram of saffron ,
which could explain --
which could explain why he started to use
genetically modified saffron ,
which is only $ 10 a pound .
but he was against using gmos .
okay . let &apos;s get something to eat . i &apos;m starving .
what are you ... ?
what ? you &apos;re always telling me to eat more greens .
this will disguise the taste of brussels sprouts . come on .
i liked this place better when they covered everything
in salt and grease .
i think i like maura .
you can &apos;t like maura .
why not ?
because it &apos;s maura , that &apos;s why .
you did .
yeah , i mean ...
she &apos;s hot and smart and has got a great ass ,
but , frankie , she &apos;s like our sister .
she didn &apos;t feel like my sister when i had my hands on her .
dude , just stop . you can &apos;t .
why not ?
promise you won &apos;t hit me ?
depends on what you say next .
you and maura -- you don &apos;t match .
hey , guys .
i was just headed out .
what is the update on the rest of holden &apos;s chef coats ?
uh , the crime lab said they had
no trace of insecticides on any of them .
hey , frankie .
hey , charlie !
i owe you a beer .
you do ? okay .
cool . come on .
all right .
good night .
frankie .
yeah ?
thanks for holding my hands today .
anytime .
two ?
thanks .
i &apos;m sure glad i checked out that cop &apos;s ass .
excuse me ?
it made me realize i want to get married ... to lydia .
oh , well , that &apos;s very sweet , tommy .
you know what ? check it out .
i got her a ring !
ooh ! it &apos;s an amethyst !
that &apos;s a lovely color .
that &apos;s really pretty , tommy .
lydia likes purple .
i &apos;m gonna go show ma .
she &apos;ll be thrilled .
see you .
bye .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t like how i &apos;m feeling . it lacks integrity .
okay , i &apos;m lost .
tommy &apos;s just so excited to go share his news with your mom .
i just -- i feel a little jealous .
i always wanted that kind of a relationship with my mother .
i mean , constance isn &apos;t warm and fuzzy ,
but she loves you , maura .
i always knew i was adopted .
when i was young and i felt lonely ,
i would tell myself ,
&quot; someday my real mother will appear . &quot;
hope came to see me today .
what ? ! why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
okay . all right , why ? why did she come and see you ?
i think she wants to make amends .
well , she doesn &apos;t need to . i &apos;m over it .
you &apos;re not over it , and you shouldn &apos;t be .
yes , i should . and so should she .
maura , hope knows how i feel about her ,
and she swallowed her pride and she came to see me anyway .
so what more does she want ? i talk to her when she calls .
yeah , you talk to her
the same way that you talk to that neighbor
that over @-@ waters your roses .
which are on my property --
and i was very polite to him
when i told him to fix his sprinklers .
all right , so , you know , why --
why would you be hope &apos;s advocate ?
i &apos;m your advocate .
now i &apos;m lost .
well , admit it . it bums you out , doesn &apos;t it ?
maura , nobody &apos;s gonna judge you
if you change your mind about her .
frankie .
um , would you like to try the coffee ?
sure .
i feel a little ridiculous .
why ? you shouldn &apos;t .
everything about that box was suspicious .
it could easily have been a bomb .
but it wasn &apos;t .
you know , sometimes we think that something is more than it is .
yeah .
i @-@ i don &apos;t really have time for coffee .
thanks , though .
just wanted to make sure you were okay .
i &apos;ll see you around .
why would holden pay off a gang banger ?
what do you mean ?
um , shabazz jones -- i recognize his name .
he &apos;s with the huntington avenue raiders .
look , you see that , under &quot; truck security &quot; ?
600 bucks a week &apos;s going to shabazz .
he &apos;s on parole for assault and battery .
who &apos;d he go after ?
a food @-@ truck owner .
shabazz was shaking down holden &apos;s food truck .
maybe holden got tired of paying .
how many times i got to tell you this ain &apos;t your spot !
you can &apos;t park here ! get the hell out of here .
hey , shabazz ? you can &apos;t touch people , man .
hey , be cool , little mama .
i know every food truck around here .
i can get you free food for a lifetime .
that &apos;s all right . i brought my money .
thank you .
that should cover for the food he stole .
give me that .
that &apos;s my order .
no , you just ordered one assault and battery and two robberies .
let &apos;s go .
you were threatening the owner of that truck .
you told him he couldn &apos;t park there
because he wouldn &apos;t pay you -- that right ?
i don &apos;t like his pulled pork .
i do . what about you , frost ?
delicious .
now , i see here ...
you like to beat up food @-@ truck owners .
says you were arrested for hitting the owner
of chubby chocolate treats with a tire iron .
yeah , we got in a scuffle . so what ?
so you trade in your tire iron for some bug spray ?
some what ? what the hell is she talking about , man ?
chef holden . he got tired of paying your rent ?
that was my only steady gig .
pretty dumb to kill him , then .
why would i kill him ? i was on his payroll .
yeah , we know that . what do you think you &apos;re doing here ?
look , i wasn &apos;t shaking him down , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
i provided a service on the payroll .
you can talk to my man reed .
reed bennet ? the guy who ran chef holden &apos;s truck ?
that &apos;s the one .
now , why would he pay you ?
&apos;cause they needed me .
i held that space for that truck every day .
600 bucks to do that .
yeah , that ... and keep my homies
away from that truck during prime business hours .
suits don &apos;t like gangsters .
wait , wait , wait , what -- what prime business hours ?
when the suits got hungry .
reed said they was trying to hook a whale or something .
what does that mean ?
the hell if i know .
book him for assault and battery .
come on . you don &apos;t want to do that .
yeah , i do .
wow . this is crazy .
shabazz said that reed paid him
to make sure the suits had access to the food truck .
the -- the food suits , maybe ?
well , reed parked it
right in front of copley square foods .
that place is full of food suits .
and dalia said that they kept trying
to schedule a meeting with holden .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
oh , it can wait .
i just -- i just found this sauce in my bag .
hey , research on olympic medalists is curious .
who would you guess is
the least happy -- gold , silver , or bronze ?
bronze . you finish third .
no , they &apos;re actually the happiest because they medaled .
the least @-@ satisfied are those who finish second .
korsak , can you play back the finale
of &quot; america &apos;s best chef &quot; ?
yeah .
reed , you are america &apos;s second @-@ best chef .
but we all love your secret sauce . congratulations .
it &apos;s the secret sauce .
chef holden was opposed to gmos .
there &apos;s no way that he would have allowed
genetically modified saffron in it .
but his olfactory nerve was severed ,
so he couldn &apos;t taste the difference .
yeah .
is reed bennet &apos;s employment contract on holden &apos;s computer ?
i think reed wanted to sell
his secret @-@ sauce recipe to copley foods ,
but there &apos;s no way that holden would &apos;ve agreed to that .
because a mass manufacturer
would most certainly use a cheap gmo saffron .
the only way reed was gonna get rich
was to get rid of chef holden .
and chef holden inadvertently gave him the keys .
listen to this .
&quot; in the event of my death ,
&quot; i leave the food truck and secret sauce
to reed bennet to manage as he sees fit . &quot;
i &apos;m not sure if this helps ,
but susie just found something else on the chef &apos;s coat --
environmentally friendly car wax .
yeah , that helps .
hey , chef .
hello .
do you have something on chef holden &apos;s death ?
yeah !
we &apos;ll have a lot more once we &apos;ve looked at your car .
why would you look at my car ? i --
chef holden &apos;s face was everywhere ,
and you were stuck slinging quinoa on a food truck .
it was smart of you to turn the suits at copley
on to your secret sauce .
were you going in to sign a contract ?
what contract ?
i &apos;m here out of courtesy .
you heard dalia say they wanted to meet chef holden .
yeah , you made a lot of courtesy visits .
visitors parking log recorded you six times
this last six months .
is this the sauce with the gmo saffron ?
there &apos;s no gmo in our stuff .
that &apos;s not what dr. isles found .
the dna profile was conclusive with the bottle i tested .
it contained genetically modified saffron .
you saved a pile of money , reed ,
paying $ 10 an ounce instead of $ 5,000 .
you almost had a deal ,
if you could just deliver chef holden .
that wasn &apos;t gonna happen . he wouldn &apos;t sell out .
&quot; hell no to gmo . &quot;
ah . oh , stand back .
i wouldn &apos;t want you to inhale bug spray .
it &apos;s positive for dichlorovos .
and it &apos;s quite a dark red ,
which means it still has a heavy presence of insecticides .
did you lay it over the hood and spray it right here , reed ?
he couldn &apos;t even taste anymore .
i let him sample the stuff with the gmo saffron in it .
he said it was great .
is that when you decided to kill him ?
hell of an opportunity .
test your product , get the suits on board ,
then kill the man , keep the brand .
dalia and i were the real chefs .
and he got all the credit .
he was the celebrity chef , pretty face ,
and his noble cause .
i was the runner @-@ up ! i should have won !
if i had , none of this would have happened !
you think about that when you &apos;re working at a prison kitchen .
what &apos;s remarkable about saffron
is everyone &apos;s palate experiences it differently .
i wonder what &apos;s gonna happen to chef holden &apos;s foods now .
dalia &apos;s just gonna keep it going , yeah ?
well , that makes me feel better .
mmm ! hi , girls !
hey , ma .
try these cakes .
wedding cakes ?
did lydia say yes ?
no , he didn &apos;t ask her yet .
i &apos;m just getting a head start .
tart with a crisp , acidic , adult finish .
maura .
can you get that ?
yeah . sure .
oh , is that strawberry ?
bubble gum . tommy &apos;s favorite .
may i come in ?
of course you can .
is everything all right ?
no , it isn &apos;t .
hey , ma , why don &apos;t we go pick out
the font for the invitations ?
well , i haven &apos;t picked out the card stock yet .
okay , we &apos;ll fluff pillows . come on .
please don &apos;t go .
i made a decision today .
i am closing my clinics .
why would you close m.e.n.d. ?
because i want you to know how sorry i am .
and i want to make restitution somehow .
wait , wait , closing clinics
that are saving desperate mothers and -- and children ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t want that .
that &apos;s not gonna make up for anything .
i need your forgiveness
and for you to accept me , flaws and all .
i can &apos;t .
please .
you are my daughter .
i &apos;m not your daughter .
maura .
whether you like it or not , you &apos;re both related .
i &apos;ve changed .
i wouldn &apos;t make the same decisions today .
so please give me ... a chance .
you know , you never answered my question .
does this bum you out ?
yes .
okay .
i mean it , maura .
no judgment .
please , can we just start over ?
people change .
life changes us .
there is ... research proving the elasticity of the brain .
you want to start over ?
very much .
go outside .
outside your house ?
yeah .
yeah , yeah , i like this plan .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
would you ...
you can knock now .
hello .
i &apos;m maura isles .
i &apos;m your ... biological daughter .
hello . i &apos;m hope martin .
i &apos;m your mother .
and i have always wanted to know you .
oh , this is so touching .
ma .
would you like some tea ?
yes .
from the ya &apos;an , sichuan province ?
yes !
no one i know likes that tea .
&apos;cause it &apos;s panda @-@ poop tea .
yes .
okay , um , i &apos;m gonna go get some frozen yogurt .
what do you want ?
chocolate with a vanilla swirl .
oh , uh , i &apos;ll have what angela &apos;s having .
and i &apos;ll have the same .
but can they not swirl ?
can they at least touch ?
i guess .
that &apos;s real progress , maura .
