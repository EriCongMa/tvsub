Hey, guys, guys? That's enough with the bag.
Settle down. Are we excited to go?
Yes!
Are you gonna behave?
Yes!
Three days ago,
the Five-O task force seized $80 million worth of cocaine being
smuggled into Honolulu Harbor on a Colombian fishing vessel.
I see you broke out the formal wear, too, huh?
Dog and pony show-- perfect occasion to wear a tie.
I always liked the tie.
Five-O's courageous actions
have made our state a safer place.
Five-O acted in cooperation with Customs,
DEA and HPD
to orchestrate an efficient and coordinated take down of
what appears to be a major player in the global drug trade.
We appreciate the help
from our law enforcement counterparts and will continue
to rely on them as this investigation moves forward.
We feel we sent a strong message
to the South American cartels.
The state of Hawaii will not be used as a way station
for illegal narcotic trafficking.
Jay, what's going on?
It's a car accident.
It's all right, everybody. Just stay in your seats.
You guys okay? Anybody hurt?
Yeah. You.
Kids, get down! Get down!
We have heard the testimony from
Lieutenant Commander McGarrett about your actions in Korea.
If his account is accurate, which we are here to verify,
then this board has the utmost respect
for your bravery and heroism.
Thank you, sir.
Is it true you led four civilians into enemy territory
and extracted the area with zero personnel casualties?
Yes, sir.
You engaged an enemy who outnumbered and outarmed you,
and you were victorious?
Yes, sir.
"Adapt and overcome," that's our motto.
And you entered hostile territory
on a decommissioned helicopter that by most estimates would be
considered unmaneuverable, let alone battle-ready?
I had the help of an experienced civilian pilot, sir.
You're saying you proceeded without the aid
of any other active members of the military?
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Commander, under most circumstances,
I would be pinning a Silver Star to your lapel.
Unfortunately,
those are not the circumstances we find ourselves in today.
Is there anything you'd like to say in your defense?
Lieutenant Commander McGarrett was in trouble.
I did what was needed to get him home.
I would do it again if I had to.
Okay, you're smiling.
That's never good.
What did they decide?
The Navy is giving me a chance to pursue my dreams.
No, Joe. No, no.
I've always wanted to open a bar.
Okay, they cannot force you out.
Well, call it an opportunity for early retirement,
with full benefits.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk to the Board of Inquiry...
No, forget it.
It's over, son.
I spent half my life serving my country, and I'm proud of it.
No regrets.
This is my fault, Joe.
No, my actions are my responsibility.
So, how about you treat me to a shrimp jambalaya
and we will call it square.
Let me tell you something, okay?
You're the only man on this planet
that would see shrimp jambalaya as a fair trade
to the end of his career, you know that?
Go ahead, take it.
We'll talk over dinner.
McGarrett.
I'll be right there.
What do we know?
Looks like a kidnapping, right? We got 16 kids, three adults
from South Shore Children's Academy; they were on a field trip.
Someone comes, takes the whole bus.
Parents been notified?
Kono's on her way to the school right now
to meet them and prepare them for a ransom call.
Who's the vic, Chin?
Jay Katsu, driver of the bus.
Still waiting on Max, but the cause of death appears
to be three gunshots to the chest, close range.
Here's what I think.
All right, guy gets out of the bus to see what's going on.
Comes over here-- boom-- gets popped by one of the kidnappers.
Wait a minute.
What are you thinking?
This accident was staged.
Look at this. There's no skid marks.
Neither of the airbags have been deployed.
There's minimal damage.
Now who do these cars belong to?
Well, HPD ran the plates.
Turns out, both vehicles were reported stolen last night.
I just spoke to the witness who called 911.
She came on the accident about 20 minutes ago.
Driver was already dead.
She see the school bus?
Yeah, she reported
seeing one traveling at high speeds, heading south.
Well, if they reached the H3,
they could be anywhere on the island.
All right, we need the cell numbers
of all the people on that bus.
Pinging their phones is gonna be
our best chance of locating them.
Everyone, put your phones in the bag.
Let's go!
Give me your phone.
Let's go!
I said now! Let's go! Phones in the bag.
I said phones in the bag!
What's you looking at?
That's right. Let's go!
You! I said you! Let's go!
Hey, kids now! Come on. Pop it up. Let's go.
Let's go. I've got all day.
Let's go! Come on, now.
I said now!
Open the door.
You! What do you think you're doing?
Today's not the day to be a hero.
Listen, are our kids okay?
What do the kidnappers want?
We're not sure, but we are doing everything necessary
to prepare for a ransom call.
Is anyone even spoke to them?
I know that you want to do everything you can to find
your children, but the best thing you can do right now
is to make sure we have all of your contact information
in case the kidnappers call any of you directly.
We're gonna be setting it up right here.
Thank you very much.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Anything I can tell them?
No, not yet.
Listen, I need you to conduct a background
on every single one of these parents.
Why? You think it could be about one of them?
Kono, it could be about all of them.
I mean, this isn't a coincidence
these guys hijacked a bus from a high-priced private school.
These kids-- they were targeted.
We need to find out why.
All right?
Yeah.
Okay. Got it.
All right. I just got off the phone with HPD.
They found a bag of cell phones belonging to
our victims dumped under the Likelike overpass.
Two highways intersect there,
and there are six off-ramps within three miles of that spot.
Great, so we have no idea
where they are or what direction they are heading.
The two stolen cars used at the staged accidents--
they were both carjackings.
We get a description on the perp?
Better.I got a name.
Ken Nakoa? We just put him away for carjacking.
Nice to see that our justice system is following through.
Yeah, he's out on bail.
But he is wearing a court-ordered ankle monitor.
Okay, good. We get a location?
Probation officer's pulling the tracking data now.
This doesn't add up.
Nakoa's a car thief with no record of violent crimes.
He doesn't fit the profile of a kidnapper.
No, no, he doesn't. But he's a businessman.
Maybe he worked for the guys who did.
Lieutenant Kelly. You have that tracking data on Ken Nakoa?
Yeah, great. Send it over.
Nakoa's on the move.
Okay, great. I got him.
He's about a half mile up the road.
All right. Which one of those trucks is he in?
How do I know?
What do you mean, how do you know?
You got the thing.
I got a blinking red dot.
That's all I got. See?
Okay, so if you see anything blinking red,
go ahead and pull it over.
Why are you angry?
I'm not angry.
Why would you be angry right now?
We're trying to get this guy.
Continue, I'm going to get angry.
Nakoa's got to be in one of those trucks.
How 'bout this one?
Nope.
Okay, I got him.
Is that him?
Not unless he's wearing a Willie Nelson disguise.
Okay, this has got to be him.
I hope this truck has good brakes.
What? Why? Why do you hope...
Hey, out, out, out, out. Move, hands up, hands up.
Where's Nakoa?
I don't know who that is.
He's gotta be here somewhere.
Go!
Pineapples.
Maybe he ditched the bracelet.
Or maybe someone ditched Nakoa.
Call his P.O., all right? Get all the data
off that tracking bracelet for the last 48 hours.
Nakoa crossed paths with these kidnappers.
I want to know where.
Who is it?
It's the ransom call.
Chin.
Call Kono, get a trace on it now.
Commander McGarrett?
Yeah, I didn't catch your name.
Oh, you can just call me
the woman who's got a gun pointed at 19 hostages.
Have any of them been harmed?
No, not yet.
Good, let's keep it that way.
What do you want?
We want what's ours.
The coke you took in that bust at the harbor.
We want it back.
You have two hours to get it together...
...or kids start dying.
Get it?
Not enough time.
What the hell is going on?
This kidnapping has got nothing to do with the parents.
This kidnapping is about us.
We want what's ours.
The coke you took in that bust at the harbor.
We want it back.
You have two hours to get it together, Commander McGarrett,
or kids start dying.
How credible is that threat?
They've already killed one person, sir.
I-I'm pretty sure they're going to do
whatever they feel like they need
to do to get their drugs back.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Okay, but that's what we're saying.
I think we don't have a choice, sir.
If we give in to their demands,
we are sending a message that we're open for business.
Today it's a bus, tomorrow it's an airplane. Then what?
You need to find these kids some other way.
What do you got from the search teams?
There's been no sightings
from helicopters, no sightings from road blocks.
We believe they might be hiding the bus somewhere.
What about the kidnappers-- what do we know about them?
Nothing, nothing.
HPD is still trying to figure out
which cartel the drugs belong to.
What about the harbor bust? What about those guys?
There were four hostiles on the vessel when we engaged.
One survived.
Mateo Vargas. He's in custody now,
but he is afraid for his life.
Okay, my guess is that he's not going to cooperate.
Then make him.
We just need to ask you a couple of questions
about the people you work for. Okay?
Are you crazy? I'm not telling you guys anything.
Well, you don't really...
you don't have a choice in that matter.
It's unfortunately, man.
Guards!
They're on a break, okay?
Show some respect.
Okay, what do you want?
A busload of kids got kidnapped this morning.
What do you know about that?
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
I swear to God, I don't know nothing.
I don't know nothing.
Vargas, listen to me, you got kids?
Huh? It's not a hard question-- you have kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three, three.
Three-- boys or girls?
Girls, I have three girls.
Okay, now imagine your three girls
are on that bus that he's talking about. What would you do?
What would you do?
I'm telling you,
I don't know anything about no kidnapping.
Okay. Get up.
Who do you work for?
I can't.
Who you working for?
I can't tell you.
He knows my family.
He knows where they live.
I swear, if I tell you that, he'll kill them.
Who, who's going to kill 'em? Huh?
I can't.
All right. Okay, all right.
Listen, we can get protection for your family.
You understand what I'm saying?
I swear to you on my badge,
I will get protection for your family.
You got to give us a name.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, Lori, I need you to find out everything you can
about a guy named Hugo Castillo.
Vargas just ID'd him as the head of the cartel.
We find him, we find our kidnappers.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Joe.
Hey, Steve.
What are you doing here?
Recon.
What are you talking about, recon?
I thought you were gonna open a bar,
embrace your retirement.
Wo Fat lured you to Korea,
killed one of your people just to find out
what you know about Shelburne,
and the clock is ticking, Steve.
What's that got to do with you being at Halawa today?
We got to find Shelburne before Wo Fat does,
and I figure, the only way to do that
is talk to the people closest to him.
Who did you come here to see?
Hiro Noshimuri.
Head of the local Yakuza-- I know,
I put him here.
Yeah, months ago,
only now he's gone because he got a couple good lawyers,
got released, and he's working on an extradition to Japan,
so I got to go.
I'll call you when I find him.
He was a mid-level hit man
for the Tarza Cartel in Colombia.
Nine months ago he took out the higher-ups and he seized control.
Well, I ran Castillo's name
through HPD, and no hits on aliases
or any known associates on the island,
so we have nothing that tells us
where they're hiding those kids.
Well, they only had three days
to put this plan together, so they're going to pick
a place they trust.
Vargas said Castillo's drugs are always brought into the harbor
and delivered to the same place.
Stash pad.
Right.
Maybe that's where they're hiding the kids.
Where are we on Nakoa's ankle monitor?
P.O. Sent the raw data over, I'm having it mapped now.
Nakoa had to drop off those stolen cars somewhere,
and I'm hoping that's the stash pad.
We got to do more than hope.
We only have 45 minutes until that next ransom call.
Okay, maybe Vargas knows where the stash pad is.
Don't count on it.
According to his statement, his job was to sit
on the product in the back of a windowless van.
So he has no idea where it is.
He's essentially a guard dog with a gun--
and not the smart bomb-sniffing kind.
Yeah, but even guard dogs hear things,
so unless Vargas is asleep in the back of the van,
he knows more than he thinks he does.
Where do you get into the van?
At the docks.
The same docks where we seized the cocaine?
That's right.
Look, if I help you,
how do I know that my daughters are safe?
Because Commander McGarrett gave you his word.
Look, we don't have that much time.
I need you to remember.
Do you always drop the drugs off at the same place?
Always.
And when you leave the docks,
does the van turn left or right?
I don't know.
I never see where we're going.
There are no windows.
Close your eyes.
Take yourself back there.
Try to remember.
Left, left, I think.
Okay.
Good.
How long is the ride?
Um, 20, 25 minutes.
Okay, good, think about that 20 to 25 minutes.
What do you hear,
smell?
What does it feel like?
We stopped a lot in the beginning.
Okay, traffic lights, good. What else?
I hear pounding, like metal on wood.
Could the pounding have been hammering, like construction?
Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.
Yeah, they're doing some renovations
on the old fisherman's wharf.
Okay, what do you remember next?
Um... after that, we go into a circle.
On-ramp?
Yeah, I think so,
'cause we don't stop for a while after that.
About how long?
Um, 15, 20 minutes?
15 to 20 minutes, okay.
Did it seem like you were climbing in altitude?
Going uphill?
Yeah, uphill
for no more than ten minutes and then we arrived.
Can you hear the ocean?
No.
No, I heard, uh, traffic,
a freeway maybe in the distance.
I'm sorry, is any of this helping?
Yeah, you're doing great.
So I got the tracking data from Nakoa's P.O.
This is everywhere he's been
in the past 48 hours.
Very busy guy.
Yeah, right?
Now, the cars used in the kidnapping were stolen here and here.
Any of these other locations could be the stash pad.
Okay, well, we definitely
don't have time to check out all these places.
Have HPD recon these locations, okay,
and then tell 'em to keep their eyes open for buildings
big enough to hide a bus.
Steve, one of the parents is here to see you.
Okay, thank you.
The other parents asked me to come.
We know you've received a ransom call,
so what do the kidnappers want?
Mr. Schafer, I can assure you that we have every resource
on the island working to bring your kids back.
How much did they ask for?
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
They have our kids and they want our money.
How much more simple can it be?
If we thought that would work, we would do that.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Mr. Schafer...
If it's not about the money,
then what is it about?
Mr. Schafer,
listen...
I know this is really hard
and I'm sorry, but you're just going to have to trust us on this.
Yeah.
Jason...
wanted me to take him surfing this morning.
He's just learning, it's all he can think about.
I told him I couldn't go.
I had to go into the office early.
I chose paperwork over my son because I assumed
I'd have a thousand other mornings
where I could go surfing with him.
So, please, just g-give them whatever they want
and bring my boy home.
Everything will be fine, Adam.
Go back to New York; you have a business to run.
Extradition to Japan.
Is that really what you want?
Yes, I'll be safer there.
Safe from what?
You don't have to run.
I'm afraid I do.
Who is it?
Who's making you do this?
Yakuza?
It's unimportant.
Look, I made a promise
not to make my business yours.
Now I need you to promise me the same.
Going down?
Get in.
Mr. Noshimuri, don't make me ask you twice.
No,
just your father.
It's okay.
Lori, Lori!
Yeah, tracing it now.
Danny.
This is McGarrett.
You have my coke?
I need proof the kids are okay.
That's not an answer.
We're not going to give you anything
until we know those kids are safe.
Oh, you want proof?
Okay, I'll give you proof.
Bring me one of them.
Wait, what are you doing?
You!
Come on.
Now!
Let's go!
I think my dad knows that guy.
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey.
Okay, just stop. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Don't do anything stupid, okay?
We're right here.
You said you wanted proof the hostages were alive.
Hear those screams?
That's your proof.
I want my coke in a truck,
lights flashing, headed north on Kam Highway.
One driver, no tails, no helicopters.
When I see you on the road, I'll call you.
You have one hour.
A second longer, and I shoot a kid.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
Listen, hey, hey, hey...
Location?
No, not enough time. She's bouncing the call
off four different towers.
It's on the windward side.
Notify HPD, have them send all their people over
to that side of the island.
Okay.
Hey. I think we got something.
Yeah, between Nakoa's tracking data
and everything Vargas remembered,
we think we've narrowed a location.
That's got to be where they're holding the kids.
What is at that location?
It's at a warehouse.
It's an old cannery.
And it looks big enough to hide a bus.
All right, let's move, let's go.
That's the bus.
Where are they?
What is that?
Not sure.
Who was sitting there?
Ms. Christie. The teacher.
Find anything?
Bunch of false-bottom fish crates.
Same ones the cartel used
to smuggle the drugs we found at the harbor.
All right, well, I found, uh, fresh motor oil over here.
I think they had a second vehicle.
We found a note tucked into the teacher's seat.
"Jason Schafer remembers seeing
one of the kidnappers talking to his father."
Schafer. Isn't that the father that came to talk to you?
Yes. Malcolm Schafer.
How does Schafer know one of the kidnappers?
Maybe he was the one who was targeted all along.
All right, hold on, hold on.
So the kidnappers have a beef with him; I get it.
They take his kid, but why the rest of the class?
Chin, get everything you can on this guy.
All right, Danny, you and Kono go to the school, talk to him.
Let's do it quick. We're running out of time.
Where you going?
I'm gonna work on plan B.
Where is this guy?
He's not here.
What about his wife?
Over there.
Mrs. Schafer.
Mrs. Schafer, we need to speak to your husband.
Do you know where he is?
Why?
Did something happen?
Is Jason okay?
Mrs. Schafer, we have reason to believe
that your son maybe recognized one of the kidnappers.
What?
Why... how would my son know one of the kidnappers?
That's what we're trying to find out.
We think Jason might have seen
this person with your husband.
If you can think of anything--
I don't know, maybe a business associate
that he might have recently had a conflict with?
No, that's-that's not possible.
Mrs. Schafer, what line of work is your husband in?
He's in real estate.
Okay, we need to speak to him now,
so it'd really be helpful if you could
tell us where he is.
Uh, he got a phone call,
he had to step away.
Okay, when?
A little while ago.
Anything?
No.
He's not here.
His kid's missing, everyone else is here;
Why would he leave?
We need to run his phone, find out who he was talking to.
There's got to be another way. What about a decoy?
No, sir, that won't work.
If they test the drugs at the drop,
these kids are dead.
You can't tell me you have no other leads.
Oh, we do have another lead, but we can't find him.
We're running out of time.
If I release those drugs and something goes wrong,
that's $80 million in cocaine back on the streets.
Sir, with all due respect, you're running out of options.
Excuse me?
These people have already shown that they're willing to kill.
If we don't negotiate, I believe they will not hesitate
to murder every person on that bus.
I agree with her, sir.
We just need the drugs as bait.
What makes you think if you deliver
they'll release the hostages?
We don't.
But right now, it's the only way
we can buy enough time to find those kids.
Danny and Lori, you guys in position?
In position.
I'm two minutes out.
Chin, how's the signal?
Tracker's up. Loud and clear.
I'm on the way.
Where are the kids?
You hold up your end, I'll hold up mine.
Get off the highway.
Head north on Plantation Road.
Two miles up, there will be a white van.
Put our drugs in the van and drive away.
I'll call you then with further instructions.
I got a positive ID on the van.
Find anything else?
Negative.
It's all clear here.
I'm heading to the van now.
All right.
I'm heading back.
Hold on, Steve.
There's something's wrong with the tracking signal.
Picking up some sort of interference.
You see any radio towers in the area?
No.
No, there's nothing here but the van.
Something's not right.
Get out of there now.
You okay?
What the hell happened?
They rigged the van.
They give you the kids' location?
No.
I don't get it.
I mean, we gave them what they wanted.
Why blow up their own drugs?
Hold on, maybe somebody else rigged the van.
No, they did it. And they didn't just
blow up the drugs, they blew up our evidence.
Destroying evidence makes sense if we have
a high-value suspect in custody.
But that bust we made at the docks,
we didn't get anybody worth this much trouble.
Or did we?
Who, Vargas?
No, he's low-level security for the cartel.
Maybe he's not.
Where are the kids, man?
I told you,
I don't know nothing about no bus or no kids.
Listen to me.
Nobody blows up $80 million worth of cocaine
to save the schmuck that sits in the back of the van.
Hey, where are the kids?!
Come on!
We're done here! Where are they?!
You're saying that the drugs are gone?
Then you got no case against me.
Damn.
That's not good for you.
Well, now there's no way you're getting those kids back.
You're Castillo.
To be fair, I did warn you.
Castillo is ruthless.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Where are the kids?
I promise you, I promise you, you are not leaving this room
until you tell us where those kids are.
Tell you what. I don't think that's true.
I think my lawyer's coming here to get me out.
I think I'm done answering questions for today.
I think I'm going home.
Gonna go see my boys.
Boys?
Yeah.
You said you had girls. Said you had three girls.
I did say that, didn't I?
Must have been mistaken.
Yeah.
Let me talk to him for one second.
Just one second.
Get up! Get up!
Let me tell you something.
Look at me.
Yeah.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care if you're Vargas or Castillo;
we don't get those kids back,
there's gonna be a toe tag hanging off your foot
that's gonna say "John Doe."
We'll see.
Kids, don't look at that. Look at me.
Someone's going to find us.
We're going to be okay, all right?
What is this?
Open!
Hey, guys.
I got something.
Remember that anonymous tip we got three days ago?
Yeah.
It was Schafer.
What are you talking about?
The call that led to the drug bust,
it came from a pay phone on the North Shore right across
the street from Schafer's office.
So I ran a voice analysis,
comparing the call with Schafer's outgoing voice mail message.
A large shipment of cocaine will be arriving tonight.
It's a match.
Wait.
Why does Schafer know about a drug shipment?
Because he's in business with Castillo.
He's got a shell company he's been using
to lease out one of his properties
to the cartel as a stash pad.
That's where we found the bus.
Okay, so Schafer's Castillo's landlord, right?
Let say they were in business together.
Why would he be making this anonymous call?
Who knows? Doesn't matter.
Relationship went south, they had a beef.
Castillo-- he leverages a bunch of kids to get his drugs back.
He gets payback with Schafer.
Two birds, one stone.
We got to find Schafer.
Hey Chin, we get anything?
I found a phone registered to Schafer's shell corporation,
and I pulled the records.
Turns out he's been getting calls
from an unlisted number all day long.
I think it's from the kidnappers.
And he got a text about an hour ago.
"Hawaiian Cement. 2:00 p.m.
Your son wants to see you. Come alone."
That's why he left the school.
He's meeting them right now.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my son?
Where's Jason?
Didn't think you'd show.
You said if I came alone,
you'd let the kids go.
You should have thought of that
before you called in that anonymous tip.
Yeah, well, you didn't tell me
you were going to be moving drugs out of my warehouse.
We had a deal.
Please, just...
do whatever you want with me.
Just let the kids go.
Sorry. It's too late for that.
What?
What did you do?
What I had to.
Move!
Drop your weapon!
Right now!
Hey, I'm going after Schafer.
Hey! Hey! Hands up.
Please.
You have to help me find my son.
I hate heroes.
Where are the kids?
Where are they?
Tell us where the kids are.
You hear that?
It's them!
Lori, kill that conveyor.
Come on! Danny! Come on!
We gonna pull them out.
Chin, bring it in.
Go, Chin!
Get us out!
They're all alive.
Came to see me off.
How kind.
No, uh, actually, we found out
you're gonna be hanging out a little bit longer than you thought.
We dug up a little new evidence.
Yeah, that's him.
That's Hugo Castillo.
I'll take the rest of your statement inside.
You're a dead man!
Easy.
You're a dead man.
And you are under arrest, my friend.
Book 'em, Danno.
Gonna start with that again?
二十分钟内来坦特拉斯环山路见我 紧急
You okay?
Your text said it was urgent.
Something you need to hear.
What the hell are you doing, Joe?
You were supposed to call me when you found him.
Yeah, well, you were a little busy.
And we needed to know what Wo Fat knows about Shelburne.
Tell him what you told me.
All of this time, McGarrett,
you've been asking the wrong questions.
What's he talking about?
Shelburne is not a thing or a place.
It's a person, and Wo Fat's very close to finding him.
Who? Who-Who is Shelburne?
I don't know.
Just someone that Wo Fat fears,
and Wo Fat fears no one.
For that reason,
he won't rest until Shelburne is dead.
What, you believe him?
I do.
Where are you going, Joe?
Going to find Shelburne.
It's me.
We got a problem.
Steve is getting too close.
