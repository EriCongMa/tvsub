who or what did you do to get this $ 20 tip ?
because i wheeled a customer home the other night ,
and all i got was a 5 .
and that was after we made out and i gave him a bath .
the lady at that table asked me what was special here ,
and i said , &quot; i used to be , &quot; and then i burst into tears .
i pull that out whenever i need a manicure .
well , it &apos;s that time of year again .
i &apos;m so jealous .
i can &apos;t believe you only get your period once a year .
it &apos;s tax season , and my accountant said
i &apos;m getting a refund .
he also complimented these moccasins ,
which are also controversial around here .
well , they do have the word &quot; mock ... &quot;
&quot; ass ... &quot;
&quot; and &quot; sin . &quot;
this is why i never wear overalls ,
&apos;cause you two would be ...
over ..
disgusted ?
precisely .
oh , earl , that reminds me .
i forgot . here you go .
i finished your taxes .
and for the future you cannot claim
your weed dealer as a dependent .
i don &apos;t know why . i &apos;m very dependent on weed .
max , since i &apos;ve been helping everyone with their taxes ,
mostly because the only other time i get to use my financial degree
is counting how many q @-@ tips we have left ,
five--
three . i dropped two in the toilet ,
and the cockroach is using them as oars for his boat .
ha . that &apos;ll be cute .
look , there are two things i won &apos;t talk about--
taxes or your flying dreams .
face it , caroline . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
okay , well , we have to talk about our taxes
and what we &apos;re gonna claim ,
and , no , you cannot claim i &apos;m ruining your life .
why ? i did that last year and got $ 10 back .
2 : 00 a.m. , closing time . let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s only 12 : 30 .
nice try , max .
come on , let &apos;s leave early .
i &apos;m more exhausted than my bra .
whoa , good , you &apos;re still open .
my fiancee wants a cupcake ,
and she always gets what she wants .
hi .
i mean , i really want a house in the hamptons ,
but i &apos;ll take a cupcake .
i &apos;m nothing like that sounded .
don &apos;t apologize .
i &apos;m everything like that sounded .
oh , i &apos;ll be right back , babe .
there &apos;s a homeless guy building a shopping bag house
around the porsche .
too bad . that homeless guy almost had a front porsche .
he hates this neighborhood .
so you &apos;ve been held up at gunpoint one or two times ?
it &apos;s like , grow a pair , right ?
so what are you eating ?
um , chocolate .
but , wait , now i &apos;m thinking red velvet .
tim put my ring in one when he proposed .
oh , he proposed with one of our cupcakes ?
that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah , it was .
i mean , it was like a whole thing because i swallowed it ,
but , once it passed ,
really so pretty .
i gave him a 20 to move to that mini cooper
instead of our car .
remind me to start calling han &quot; mini cooper . &quot;
babe , i &apos;ve been thinking .
uh @-@ oh . that &apos;s never good .
no , it &apos;s great , babe . listen .
so , since you proposed to me with one of their cupcakes ,
i was thinking that these girls should do our wedding cake .
but , babe , we already ordered a wedding cake .
$ 1,300 . remember , babe ?
i know , but , babe .
they said babe less in the movie babe .
so do you guys do wedding cakes ?
no .
yes .
i don &apos;t . she does .
she &apos;s the baker , and , yes ,
we do tons of wedding cakes .
gay weddings , straight weddings .
bed wettings .
claire , you do whatever you want ,
but i &apos;m gonna wait in the car .
i just can &apos;t do the cake stuff again , babe .
he doesn &apos;t want to do the cake stuff .
well , i don &apos;t want to do the butt stuff .
you know what i mean ?
no .
yes .
why don &apos;t you come in and we can talk about it ?
enter through the diner .
okay .
see you guys in a sec .
what is wrong with you ?
i told you i didn &apos;t want any more white girls in the shop .
and since when do we do wedding cakes ?
since that guy said $ 1,300 .
you can do this , max . you went to pastry school .
i also went to high school ,
but i can &apos;t tell you which president rock hudson was .
i don &apos;t do wedding cakes .
okay , i know this may not be the best time for you
to make your first wedding cake because of your recent breakup .
oh , it &apos;s not about deke .
if you remember , i &apos;m the one who sent his &apos; fro out the door .
weddings are just stupid .
this whole idea of celebrating love ?
i mean , love works out less than chris christie .
right through here .
there you go , miss .
thanks .
did you want something else ?
i &apos;ll take whatever i can get .
okay , we &apos;re done .
you &apos;re lucky . this morning , a cannoli shell
pressed sexual harassment charges against him .
oh , my god , you guys .
your shop is so adorbs .
i &apos;m claire , by the way .
i owned a store on bedford ave .
a dress shop called &quot; get the frock out . &quot;
oh , i remember that place .
wasn &apos;t it right next to the hair salon ,
&quot; unbeweavable &quot;
yeah , yeah , between &quot; unbeweavable &quot;
and the kosher smoothie place
called &quot; the wandering juice . &quot;
后被诅咒流浪天涯海角 直到耶稣再临
i love their menorah @-@ nge juice .
yeah , you know , it was always my dream to have a dress shop .
but then after a year hardly anyone was coming in ,
and i was like , maybe i should get the frock out .
so i bailed .
i totally get it .
our first shop failed , but we got up ,
dusted ourselves off--
well , max went on a four @-@ day bender ,
but i found her and dusted her off ,
then we started again .
yeah , good thing you downloaded the &quot; find your drunk roommate &quot; app .
oh , so you guys kept going , even though you failed ?
why ? don &apos;t you have boyfriends ?
so when are you two getting married ?
oh , in three days .
three days ? you &apos;re so calm .
yeah , well , i was in the plane that crashed in the hudson ,
so after that everything &apos;s just kind of been &quot; meh . &quot;
so do you know what kind of cake you want ?
absolutely . something traditional ,
something very old school , you know , very romantic ,
but , wait , now i &apos;m thinking
you guys are so cool ,
what if we did something with a weird hipster williamsburg vibe ?
so you want an obnoxious cake on a trust fund
wearing an ironic t @-@ shirt with hpv ?
but , wait , now i &apos;m thinking pastels for spring .
oh , but , wait , now i &apos;m thinking ,
colors . i love clowns .
wow , she changes her mind more than i change my underwear .
so twice ?
sophie , on your tax form here ,
you listed your occupation as &quot; sophie . &quot;
yeah , it &apos;s a full @-@ time job , baby .
and who claims $ 5,000 worth of mascara ?
it &apos;s a business deduction for my cleaning business .
i give it out to all the underage girls from poland as treats .
just because you &apos;re scrubbing toilets
doesn &apos;t mean your eyes can &apos;t pop .
do you have any legitimate anything
that we can use for anything ?
here &apos;s a big receipt .
$ 2,500 for stolichnaya .
you can &apos;t write off liquor .
no , irina stolichnaya .
yeah , she waxes my eyebrows .
and my downstairs eyebrows .
okay , well , there &apos;s no line on this form
for downstairs eyebrows ,
so i &apos;m just gonna list it as home office .
yeah , well , i do work out of it .
caroline , where &apos;s max ?
as much as i enjoy a two @-@ hour break
from being called a tiny woman ,
she &apos;s supposed to be working .
max , how &apos;s the cake going ?
that bride &apos;s a mess .
she changed her mind while she was changing her mind .
not the good stuff on the top shelf !
oh , you can &apos;t reach it anyway , mini cooper .
joke &apos;s on her . i have a collapsible ladder .
oh , hi , claire . max is working on it right now .
oh , you &apos;ve been thinking ?
caroline , can i get anything for a panty liner ?
i &apos;m on the phone with claire .
you mean un @-@ claire ?
she wants to make a couple changes .
what should i tell her ?
tell her i hate her .
no , you know what , i &apos;ll tell her .
i love to tell people things . give me the phone .
max , i beg you . $ 1,300 .
oh , my god . she is so crazy .
i should just make a giant cake
and have a psychiatrist pop out of it .
give me the phone .
hey , claire , babe . what &apos;s happening , babe ?
max , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and i know i said i didn &apos;t want the fondant frosting ,
but now i just saw a photo of another wedding cake
that was so gorge .
and i started thinking ...
uh @-@ huh . sure . no problem .
so then we can do the fondant ?
yes , definitely fondant .
perfect . bye . love you .
love you too .
max , i know you worked hard ,
and you &apos;re probably upset about having to change it .
i &apos;m sensing a lot of hostility
that has nothing to do with that couple
and may be more about you
and a certain groom that didn &apos;t happen .
what , you can &apos;t light a couple &apos;s head on fire
without it being about your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
max , i know you &apos;re sad about it .
i heard you crying last night .
that was you crying .
well , someone was crying .
oh , my god . max . it &apos;s beautiful .
you did an amazing job .
that &apos;s quite a cake cake cake .
calm down . i made a cake . i didn &apos;t fold a fitted sheet .
ooh , and i like the new bride and groom .
by the way , i fished the other ones out of the garbage
in case we ever get a burn victim wedding .
okay , i got the extra icing . let &apos;s go .
now grab it with two hands
and lift with your knees .
oh , is that how you think it should go ?
&apos;cause i was gonna grab it with my head
and lift it with my face .

i blame science .
people shouldn &apos;t be living this long .
max , i need a break .

this cake looks perfect . you would never know .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m fond of the fondant . covers everything .
we &apos;ll be long gone by the time they realize
it &apos;s half cake @-@ half styrofoam from the radio shack garbage .
hi . i &apos;m the wedding planner / my own funeral planner
&apos;cause it ain &apos;t going great .
you the cake girls ?
you think just &apos; cause we &apos;re two girls
with a giant cake we &apos;re the cake girls ?
you think &apos; cause i &apos;m fake smiling
i won &apos;t throw you down a flight of stairs ?
you do that ? do you have a card ?
sorry . we had a rough morning getting this here .
you ? she changed the menu again .
i spent the whole morning making 17 turkeys look
like 17 hams for that crazy bitch .
oh , come on , that &apos;s a little har--
what ? she won &apos;t come out of her room ?
the bride has cold feet .
that crazy bitch .
here &apos;s a crazy idea .
how about the check for the cake ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna tell you two what i told
the make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ popsicle guy .
nobody gets paid until the bride walks down the aisle .
nobody .
there &apos;s gonna be popsicles ?
she &apos;s not that crazy .
so what are we gonna do now ?
let &apos;s go .
max , we can &apos;t go .
we need this money .
we also need a shower curtain that doesn &apos;t give us rashes .
but , wait , we really need this cake money .
we also really need a toilet
that flushes everything the first time .
while you were doing the cake , i was doing our taxes .
and we owe uncle sam $ 1,500 .
man , why does every uncle i know try to screw me ?
so what are we gonna do ?
you heard that woman--
nobody gets paid until the bride walks down the aisle .
nobody .
knock @-@ knock . there &apos;s the gorgeous bride .
your dress is beautiful .
it &apos;s a beautiful dress to get married in
right now in the next room .
no , i hate it . i &apos;m taking it off .
i &apos;m not wearing this dress
or that one or that one .
because i &apos;m thinking marriage is stupid .
so stupid .
max .
stupid beautiful , and everyone should do it .
nope . it &apos;s not for me .
like underwear .
曾多次被狗仔队拍到裙下没穿内裤
oh , you &apos;ll feel fine
as soon as you get back in this dress .
or that dress or that dress .
okay , i feel like you guys are forcing me into this dress .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
forcing you into a dress for money ?
now where &apos;s that freaking veil ?
nope , not that one .
this was just a backup veil .
you can &apos;t even see my face .
it was in case i got herpes .
you know how it is .
yeah .
no .
anyways , i &apos;m thinking ...
what ,
like seven different things all resulting in us not getting paid ?
listen , i &apos;m thinking
that maybe i bailed out of my shop too soon .
i mean , i left after only a year .
why ? &apos; cause i was just scared ?
well , everybody &apos;s afraid of failure .
no , not failure .
there was a gang shooting in front of my dress shop .
i had to bury two mannequins .
for future reference , just draw a teardrop on your face ,
几颗泪珠代表失去 / 杀过的人数
and they &apos;ll move it to banana republic .
well , i mean , it wasn &apos;t easy for you guys , right ?
but you hung in there ,
and now you have this big , successful cake business .
we lied .
it &apos;s terrible .
we &apos;re losers .
get married .
claire , the only thing harder than building a business
is finding love .
look at her . she just lost someone she loves ,
and quite frankly she doesn &apos;t think
it &apos;s ever gonna happen for her again .
i mean , none of us do .
not even han ?
no , he &apos;s the one who brought it up .
claire , who knows you better than us ?
you &apos;re getting married .
you &apos;re right . i should get married .
but not to tim .
what ?
you guys will tell him for me , right ?
tell him i &apos;m no good . tell him i &apos;m sorry .
you know what , tell him whatever you want .
you guys decide . i &apos;m easy .
you know what she &apos;s not ? easy .
you heard that woman--
nobody gets paid until the bride walks down the aisle .
now , remember , don &apos;t lift this veil
until the party planner hands me that check .
why don &apos;t you have to wear the dress ?
you &apos;re practically a virgin .
max , somebody has to walk down the aisle , and i can &apos;t do it .
marriage means something to me ,
and i only plan to walk down that aisle once .
you also said that about the yeast infection aisle at cvs ,
but there you were last saturday
pretending to buy children &apos;s cough syrup .
let &apos;s go .
wait , max .
max , wait , wait !
wait , max ! !
now just walk down the aisle like it &apos;s your special day .
go . the bride never talks to the cake lady .
people are like , &quot; who &apos;s that ? &quot;
if you think they &apos;re like , &quot; who &apos;s that ? &quot; now ,
wait a few minutes till that veil gets lifted .
can &apos;t believe it . she &apos;s actually walking down that aisle .
yup , that &apos;s totally her walking down the aisle .
so the check , you can hand it to me now .
you look stunning , babe .
come on , come on , come on .
i &apos;ll just take whatever check &apos;s on top .
babe , babe , wait .
now i &apos;m thinking i do want to get married .
babe , if you &apos;re there , who is ...
&apos;sup ?
babe , i know i said i didn &apos;t want any kids ,
but now i &apos;m thinking four .
babe , you should have said that before the vasectomy .
you can always reverse it .
again .
so you &apos;re the father , huh ?
and you stuck around .
that &apos;s an interesting way to play it .
okay , i got the check . we can leave .
not now . i &apos;m doing the father @-@ daughter dance .
may i cut in ?
oh , no , with her .
if you &apos;re trying to hook up with me ,
you &apos;re a little late .
that dad just slipped me his room key .
you really do make a lovely bride .
oh , thanks . you know i have one
of those ham turkeys in my underwear , right ?
oh , i thought you were just happy to see me .
this is nice .
and that cake really is beautiful .
thanks .
wish i could have showed it to ...
deke .
yeah .
so are you really okay ?
i know you loved him .
i did , which is the worst
because it made me feel almost like a person .
max , caroline , hi .
i just wanted to say thank you for everything .
and i was watching you guys dance together ,
and now i &apos;m thinking i might be into girls .
can i call you ?
yes .
no .
great .
what do you mean the bottom of the cake says radio shack ?
that &apos;s our cue .
wait , wait , i haven &apos;t thrown the bouquet yet .
hey , single ladies .
here we go .
one , two ,
three .
hey , cake girls .
styrofoam ?
it &apos;s gluten @-@ free .
