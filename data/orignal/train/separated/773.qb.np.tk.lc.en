i &apos;m sorry , but you can &apos;t come with us tonight .

more important stuff to do here .
i have to clean out my closet and ...

kicked out of the discotheque , nick .
i didn &apos;t even do anything .
damn it , nick , take the coat off , all right ?

nice coat you got there .
well , i just actually wear it &apos; cause
it gives me confidence .
that &apos;s kind of sad .
you know what &apos;s really sad
is that he stole the jacket .
it &apos;s not technically stealing .
he &apos;s still reeling from being dumped .
aw . he &apos;s attached to it .
like a little bitch &quot; bwanky . &quot;
it &apos;s not like a blanky , dude .
it looks like a &quot; bwanky . &quot;
it &apos;s not like my &quot; bwanky . &quot;
the only reason i &apos;m out tonight is
to make sure he doesn &apos;t do anything stupid .
that &apos;s not true . i &apos;m not gonna ...
shut up , schmidt .
i mean , i could take care of you ,
if you wanted .
you can what ?
i love sad guys
and you seem sadder than most .
i think your plan sounds okay .
when you go home at night , do you look in the mirror
and just think , &quot; i am the worst &quot; ?
actually yes , i do .
yeah ?
yeah , a lot of the times .
you hate yourself ?
i definitely don &apos;t like myself .
it &apos;s right on the line of hate .
what the hell is this ?
i don &apos;t know how to talk to women .
reason being , i feel like
you all think that i just want one thing from you .
i want the one thing .
but a bunch of other th ...
can a man just want all the things ?
i mean , damn .
i like a challenge .
and you are one big challenge .

cece , it &apos;s jess-- call me back ,
i &apos;m alone in the loft .
i think there &apos;s something out ...

i &apos;d like to introduce you to our roommate jess .
welcome to our home .
jess , this loft has old pipes--
i &apos;ve told you that a million times ,
but you never listen during pipe talk .
well , pipe talk &apos;s boring .
what is this ?
what is what ... ?
you drew my face on a melon ?
what else was i supposed to draw your face on ?
nothing . don &apos;t draw my face .
okay .
jess , for some reason , that girl out there ,
she is sexually aroused by other people &apos;s misery .
do you understand the position that puts me in ?
it puts you in a really good position ?
it really does . and then what happens ?
okay , i understand how , in this instance ,
i might have cooled things off for you .
thank you for admitting that .
i am prepared to fix it .
&apos;cause , son , i &apos;m gonna get you laid .
okay , it &apos;s not how it is and never call me &quot; son &quot;
and don &apos;t talk like that .
the game is true american
but with a sexy new twist : clinton rules .
pick your interns .
i don &apos;t understand the game .
uh , you &apos;re gonna be my intern .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s stripping .
it &apos;s not just stripping . it &apos;s sexy .

it just ... it just reminded me
how much i want to have kids , you know ?
was that just a really weird thing
to say on a first date ?
no .
are you sure ? it felt a bit weird .
oh , my best friend has texted me , like , 12 times .
i get it-- you &apos;re just trying to get out of the date .
no , no , no-- no , this is real .
it &apos;s the kids thing . i knew it .
some psycho keeps scratching at her door and then running away .
she &apos;s pretty sure it &apos;s the calabasas scratcher .
i mean , is that a thing ?
what ?
i don &apos;t keep up with local news .
oh , look , i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s fine .
you don &apos;t have to lie to me .

this coat is an unfair advantage-- take it off .
i love the coat .

hey , schmidt !
hey , hey ! no !
order ! order !
all right , there &apos;s only one way to solve this .
two of us have to go behind the iron curtain ,
which is that door there , and kiss .
and there has to be a &quot; clear and present threat of tongue . &quot;
this is why i voted for you .
holly , you ready for this ?
definitely . it &apos;s the president &apos;s order .
ready ?
let &apos;s do the count .
the two , three or four .
so when we do this , do two .
okay .

you gotta do three ,
and keep away from two ,
not four , two .
just not two ...
you give me two , not four .
one , two , three .

mulligan ! mulligan !
holly , wait for me ! i &apos;m very sad !
kiss ! kiss ! kiss !
open the door ! open the door !

you think ?
kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss !
okay , we kissed .
let us out . sent you a picture .
that ain &apos;t no kiss , man !
come on , inspector gadget ,

more emotionally fragile than nick right now .

of an uber successful marketing executive &apos;s journey ...

i don &apos;t want to put
my tongue in your mouth , if you don &apos;t like it .

okay , all right , great .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
all right .
ready ?
yeah .
one , two ... i &apos;m actually not gonna do a count .
okay .

well , you can &apos;t try to kiss me like a joker and expect ...
okay , you &apos;re ... let me out of here !
sometimes , i hear her name when the wind blows .
please ! open the door !
cece .
you know , i left something behind in the desert that day ,
my faith and true love ...
and my future biracial child .
you , you kind of lost me there .
not really doing it for me .
it &apos;s more depressing than sad .
it &apos;s not depress ...
it &apos;s depressing .
it &apos;s sort of depressing .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not depressing .
i &apos;m gonna tell you why it &apos;s not depressing .
&apos;cuz she is in love with me ,
i &apos;m over it completely .
having said that , it &apos;s so hard to move on .
do @-@ do you know what i mean ?
yes .
can you help me move on , holly ?
you need help moving .

i need to kill schmidt !
i &apos;m just trapped
until i kiss nick !
what ?
you &apos;re the ... she &apos;s the cece ?
right there , in the flesh .
oh my ...
you are obsessed !
cece , honey , you have to move on , okay ?
you can &apos;t love somebody forever .
i &apos;m sorry . you love that small shiny man ?
no !
what do you mean , small , man ?
none of this is true .
no , because i &apos;m on a date .
should we make out to make him jealous or something ?
are you lying to me ? i really hate being lied to .
i would never lie to you .
i haven &apos;t lied to you this whole time we &apos;ve been in this loft-- that &apos;s a fact .
cece , uh ...
hey .
please tell me , in front of holly ,
how much you still love me .
i &apos;m sorry . is this why we came here ?
please , i don &apos;t really know what that accent is .
english .
i speak english . that didn &apos;t sound like english .
it will be my final request ,
i promise ,
so both of us can move on .
cause i , you know , i &apos;d really like to move on .
i get it .
i &apos;d like to move on all night long with holly .
okay , i get it .
i &apos;m only gonna say this one more time .
i always have and always will ...
love you .
all right , all right , you know , this is the most elaborate way
to get out of dating me that i &apos;ve ever experienced , so ...
winny , it &apos;s nicky .
open the door , man !
i guess the game is over .
i thought we were working together .
i was gonna start on your confidence
and work my way up to your facial hair .
what &apos;s your fiance gonna say about that ?
oh this ... i just wear it so guys don &apos;t hit on me in bars .
okay .
i &apos;m single .
what are you gonna do about it , huh ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you what i &apos;m gonna do .

just open the door .
yeah .
c minus . you kiss like a damn bitch .
oh , you &apos;re messing with me , okay .
little bit .
nick , i &apos;m gonna admit it .
i might be your cooler .
i chalk it up to bad timing .
well , thank you for admitting that .
but to be fair ,
you are your own cooler 70 % of the time .
some basic grooming , nick ,
and you &apos;d be smoking hot .
i &apos;d be smoking hot ?
you &apos;d be smoking hot .
you do want to kiss me , then .
all bets are off if you take a shower .
that is very nice of you .
jess , are you okay ? i got your message !

good night , nick .

i meant something like that .
oh , uh , hey , babe ,
