so what kind of cruise is this you &apos;re going on ?
it &apos;s called the born again boat ride .
christian quarterly gave it their highest rating--
five thorny crowns .
i do wish you &apos;d come with me , sheldon .
well , mom , if i did , it would be conclusive proof
that your god can work miracles .
you &apos;re missing out .
it &apos;s gonna be wall @-@ to @-@ wall fun .
it &apos;s all themed .
there &apos;s jonah and the whale watching .
all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat last supper buffet .
and my personal favorite , gunning with god .
what &apos;s gunning with god ? i &apos;m afraid to ask .
oh , it is a hoot and a half .
you write your sins on a clay pigeon ,
they fire &apos; em up in the air ,
and you pulverize them with a 12 @-@ gauge shotgun
full of our lord &apos;s forgiveness .
frankly , mom , i &apos;m encouraged to see
how advanced your group has become--
you are willing to sail out into the ocean
without fear of falling off the edge .
for example ,
if shelly was aboard , he &apos;d write ,
&quot; smart mouth &quot; on his pigeon ,
and then bam !
the lord giveth and the lord bloweth away .
well , mom , according to my itinerary for our weekend together ,
the fun begins with fried chicken .
sounds delicious .
good , &apos; cause i got you everything you need to make it .
you are in for a treat .
my mother &apos;s fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin .
sheldon , she just got off the plane .
she doesn &apos;t want to cook .
of course she does .
making me food is her way of saying &quot; i love you &quot; &quot;
making me food when she &apos;s too tired to cook
is her way of saying &quot; i really love you . &quot;
actually , i wouldn &apos;t mind going out for a bite , sheldon .
won &apos;t that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you &apos;re going to make me ?
all right , that settles it , we &apos;re going out .
do you like sushi ? there &apos;s a great little place down the street .
i &apos;ve never had it ,
but there &apos;s no harm in trying something new .
there &apos;s a lot of harm in trying something new .
that &apos;s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits .
sheldon , you &apos;re talking like a crazy person .
actually , i had him tested as a child .
doctor says he &apos;s fine .
told you .
although , i do regret not following up
with that specialist in houston .
いらっしゃいます
stop yelling !
i &apos;m not happy about this .
what &apos;s the last thing you were ever happy about ?
the prospect of fried chicken .
this is exciting .
back home , the diner on route four serves sushi ,
but it &apos;s just cut up fish sticks
and a side of uncle ben &apos;s .
they put it on the menu in those kung fu letters ,
but that don &apos;t make it sushi .
uh , kung fu letters might not be politically correct .
oh , i thought the one we couldn &apos;t say was &quot; ching chong &quot;
yeah , yeah , that , too .
so , shelly ,
what &apos;s up with you and your friend amy ,
if you don &apos;t mind a mother prying a bit ?
well , there &apos;s actually big news on the amy front .
she &apos;s been studying
the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals .
she &apos;s this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine .
do you have any idea what &apos;s going on with those two ?
it &apos;s kind of like the loch ness monster .
maybe there &apos;s something there , maybe there isn &apos;t .
we &apos;ll probably never know .
but sometimes it &apos;s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it .
how are you doing on the young lady front ?
i hear you &apos;re in some sort of a long distance situation ?
yeah , it &apos;s raj &apos;s sister .
it &apos;s kind of tough . she &apos;s in india .
also , her parents aren &apos;t happy she &apos;s dating someone white .
oh , that &apos;s a funny turn , isn &apos;t it ?
you never think about it going the other way .
well , you can &apos;t force things .
you need to figure out if you &apos;re in a relationship
or if you &apos;re just calling it one .
it &apos;s like they say--a cat can have kittens in the oven
but that don &apos;t make &apos; em biscuits .
and that reminds me of another saying .
you can lead a chicken to crisco ,
but you can &apos;t make your mother fry it .
sheldon , you pester me one more time about chicken ,
i will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant .
please pester her . please , for me .
so , mrs. cooper , what did you think of the sushi ?
it was good .
the only thing that would have made it better
is if it was cooked
and if it was beef .
sheldon , when is your landlord going to fix the elevator ?
i don &apos;t know .
lately we &apos;ve been talking about
converting it into a missile silo .
your son seems to think
we need to launch a preemptive strike on burbank .
get them before they get us .
hey , look who decided to show up .
raj , what are you doing ?
i couldn &apos;t find you guys so i bought six new friends .
three , sadly , are dead .
mom , you remember rajesh ?
rajesh , my mother .
of course.mrs. cooper .
so nice to see you again .
well , it &apos;s so nice to see you , too .
i thought it was our indians
that had the occasional alcohol problem .
we don &apos;t say that , either .
i &apos;ll make you a list .
oh , that would be mighty white of you .
so , raj , what pain are you trying
to cover up with alcohol ?
nothing , i &apos;m fine .
are ya ?
no .
that &apos;s better .
now tell me what &apos;s bothering you .
i &apos;m so lonely .
oh , yes , born alone , die alone .
it &apos;s a tragic human condition .
now , raj ,
if you &apos;ll excuse my mother ,
she &apos;s about to make a pecan pie
that &apos;ll be so good
i &apos;ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken .
sheldon , your friend is hurtin &apos; .
what do we do when someone &apos;s hurtin &apos; ?
offer them a hot beverage .
and when they &apos;re drunk as a skunk ,
what beverage do we offer ?
coffee .
and what do we do it with ?
now you listen to me .
i know you feel like you can &apos;t find someone ,
but there &apos;s a lock for every key .
back home , there &apos;s a girl works at the wal @-@ mart .
tall , tall girl .
woman could hunt geese with a rake .
thought she &apos;d never find a man ,
then one day , wouldn &apos;t ya know ,
harlem globetrotters come to town .
long story short ,
today that woman travels the world
with a semi @-@ professional basketball player
and two beautiful mixed @-@ race babies .
i didn &apos;t get a lot of that because of your accent ,
but the general tone was soothing
and somehow i feel better .
i &apos;m not going to get my pecan pie , am i ?
you want some oreos ?
double stuf ?
no , regular .
nice . kick a man when he &apos;s down .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re finally getting to do something together ,
just the two of us .
sure .
one thing you really miss when you &apos;re on vacation is laundry .
careful , you &apos;re using too much downey .
you know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy .
well , this takes me back .
me doing your laundry , you next to me criticizing .
it is nice , isn &apos;t it ?
mrs. cooper .
oh , hello , darlin &apos; .
sheldon , you didn &apos;t tell me your mom was coming .
it was in my weekly e @-@ mail blast .
right between &quot; beet season is finally here &quot;
and &quot; uh @-@ oh , red stool from beets leads to cancer scare . &quot;
so , how &apos;ve you been ?
good , good .
i hear that leonard has a new girlfriend .
how are you doing with all that ?
oh , fine . you know , it &apos;s been a while .
i &apos;m getting back out there .
let me ask you , when you get back out there ,
are you wearing this ?
well , it &apos;s super cute on .
that top has paid for itself in free drinks
like ten times what it cost .
yes , penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures .
hon , you think maybe the reason
why you &apos;re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with
is because you &apos;re letting them ride the roller coaster
without buying a ticket ?
oh , they don &apos;t always get to ride the roller coaster .
sometimes they only get to spin the teacups .
now i &apos;m going out tonight .
would it be crazy to ask you
to look at the outfit i &apos;m going to wear ?
oh , not crazy at all .
and don &apos;t beat yourself up .
when i was your age , you could have me for a car ride
and a bottle of strawberry wine .
that will not be in this week &apos;s e @-@ mail blast .
so , this spring ,
i get to go to the international space station .
oh , my word , a trip to the heavens .
if you ever want to live there eternally ,
i &apos;ve got a good book you could read .
thanks , but i watch the charlie brown christmas special every year ,
so i get the gist .
i bet your mom is really proud of you .
nope .
she says if i don &apos;t back out
she &apos;s going to go on a hunger strike .
it would take years before
she &apos;d be in any kind of danger , but still .
i &apos;ve got a treat for us tomorrow , mom .
i &apos;m taking you
to see saul perlmutter give a lecture
about his nobel prize @-@ winning work in cosmology .
and the best part is ,
at the q and a afterward ,
i &apos;ve worked up a couple of &quot; q &apos;s &quot;
that will stump his sorry &quot; a. &quot;
i don &apos;t know , shelly .
i thought we could do a little sightseeing .
what sight is better than your little boy
embarrassing a nobel laureate ?
come on , sheldon , we &apos;ll take your mom
to see the hollywood sign ,
the wax museum , the walk of fame .
ooh , maybe a little rodeo drive .
well , i can &apos;t spend $ 12,000 on a handbag ,
but it &apos;s free to look upon those
who do with righteous condemnation .
what do you say ?
what do i say ?
i say you people need to stop ruining my mom &apos;s visit
with your sushi , and your sadness
and your slutty shirts .
stop it .
he &apos;s not talking about your shirt . your shirt is fine .
these are delicious .
the trick to pancakes is bacon grease .
i cook everything in it .
everything ? aren &apos;t you worried about your health ?
oh , doctors are always changing their mind .
one week bacon grease is bad for you .
the next week we &apos;re not getting enough of it .
good morning , shelly .
mom , i want to apologize for my behavior last night .
apology accepted .
great .
now , you &apos;re going to love the perlmutter lecture .
look , he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years ,
but i thought you could stick your fingers in your ears
and hum &quot; amazing grace &quot; during those parts .
i am still going out with your friends .
but i apologized .
and that was hard for me because i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
shelly , i hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls
while you were growing up .
i want to go sightseeing .
so why don &apos;t you have some pancakes ,
get dressed and come with us .
i &apos;m not going , and you can &apos;t make me .
you &apos;re right , i can &apos;t . have a nice day .
well , i &apos;m going to stand here until you change your mind .
well , then you are going to stand there all day .
i &apos;m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there .
i can &apos;t believe my own mother is abandoning me .
i am not abandoning you .
sheldon , abandoning you is leaving you in a basket
on a church doorstep .
i am going to hollywood and thank a wax ronald reagan
for his service to our country .
we appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship , mother .
well , i guess we are .
sorry . syrup .
all right , mom .
when you &apos;re at the ripley &apos;s believe it or not museum ,
if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance
to spend the day with the world &apos;s most wonderful son ,
believe it , because it &apos;s true .
i hadn &apos;t ...
that lecture was a waste of time .
i made more accurate diagrams
of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall
with the contents of my diaper .
are you getting sick ?
no , i &apos;m just allergic to people
who get nobel prizes for no good reason .
sheldon , is it possible that your foul mood--
or , to use the clinical term , bitchiness--
is because your mother isn &apos;t making you a priority ?
no . or to use the clinical term , &quot; nuh @-@ uh &quot; &quot;
are you sure ? the infant @-@ mother pair @-@ bond
is the building block of primate psychology .
oh , there it is .
it always comes back to monkeys with you .
just monkeys , monkeys , monkeys .
sheldon , we &apos;re all animals .
and granted , there are aspects of you that are extraordinary ,
but when it comes to emotions and relationships ,
you &apos;re just like everybody else .
are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems
are no different than those of a stupid person ?
actually , some research indicates
that by not overthinking ,
the less intelligent handle emotions better .
sure you &apos;re not coming down with a cold ?
oh , yes , the common cold .
just like everyone else .
you &apos;d love that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
oh , this one &apos;s sweet .
you know , for your rosary rattlers .
mrs. cooper , we say &quot; catholics &quot; not &quot; rosary rattlers . &quot;
my goodness , it &apos;s a wonder you people in california
can talk at all .
this is like the worst hollywood tour ever .
what are we gonna do ? she wanted to see churches .
hey , they have wine here , don &apos;t they ?
none of our gods have abs like that .
yep , that &apos;s the last jew who did sit @-@ ups .
and look where it got him .
hey , while we &apos;re here , why don &apos;t we all do some praying ?
let &apos;s put a little church in this church .
oh , i &apos;m not sure we should ...
it &apos;s easy . i &apos;ll show you how .
lord , mary cooper here .
coming to you from gomorrah , california .
i want to thank you
for the blessing that is my little shelly .
i also want to thank you for the continued strength
not to coldcock him with my bible .
all right , penny , your turn .
okay , um ...
hey , god .
what &apos;s up ?
um , i &apos;m good , but , uh ,
it would be a big help to my family
if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth .
but no cops . be cool .
she also goes a little overboard
on the &quot; love thy neighbor &quot; .
could probably use that chat you had with mary magdalene .
leonard , you &apos;re up .
wasserman , you &apos;re on deck .
okay . i don &apos;t know ...
it &apos;s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller .
oh , um ... if you could help out with me and my girlfriend .
she &apos;s all the way in india . that would be great .
hear that ? girl trouble .
turns out we were both wrong on that front .
how about you ?
oh , me ?
no . thanks , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m really just trying not to burst into flames .
rajesh ?
he says he &apos;s having trouble
dropping those last five pounds .
huh , i might have gone with the talking @-@ to @-@ girls thing .
no , you only get one wish .
look at the two of us .
me , a highly regarded physicist .
the kind of mind that comes along once ,
maybe twice in a generation .
you , the common man ,
tired from your labors as a stockbroker ,
or vacuum cleaner salesman , or bootblack .
but deep down inside ...
apparently we &apos;re just two peas in a pod .
a regular pea ,
and the kind of pea that comes along once ,
maybe twice in a generation .
rain .
another great equalizer .
falling on the head of the brilliant
and the unremarkable alike .
smarty @-@ pants .
oh , mrs. cooper , it smells so good .
you take notes , darlin &apos; .
the real way to get a man is with melted cheese
and cream of mushroom soup .
he &apos;ll die at 50 but his love will be true .
i need a tissue . this one got wet .
here .
thank you . yeah , i &apos;ve learned something today .
you and i , in so many ways ,
other than intelligence and what counts ,
we &apos;re the same
sweetheart , are you sick ?
i hope so .
because if this is well , life isn &apos;t worth living .
oh , sugarpie , you are burning up .
we &apos;ve got to get you to bed .
okay .
don &apos;t worry . mama &apos;s here to take care of her baby .
and just to be clear , only her baby
and not these other people .
of course .
can i have tea with honey
and toast with the crust cut off ?
you can have whatever you want .
thanks , mom . you &apos;re the best .
boy , last time i put vaporub on you ,
you didn &apos;t have hair on your chest .
i know , it filled in last year .
i didn &apos;t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit .
and whose fault was that ?
yours .
shelly , you &apos;re not eight years old anymore .
we have to have a different relationship .
no , we don &apos;t .
the one we have works great .
sweetheart , you are a grown man .
or maybe i &apos;m part of a new species ,
that lives for hundreds of years ,
which means i &apos;m still basically a toddler .
oh , i so should have taken you to houston .
does this mean you &apos;re not going to sing &quot; soft kitty &quot; ?
no , i will always sing you &quot; soft kitty . &quot;
soft kitty , warm kitty
little ball of fur ...
mrs. cooper , were we supposed to take that pie
out of the oven ?
get out !
well , that was rude .
well , i know , but he means well .
sing .
happy kitty , sleepy kitty
what are you trying to pull , mom ?
from the top .
this is what i &apos;m talking about .
soft kitty , warm kitty
little ball of fur ...
