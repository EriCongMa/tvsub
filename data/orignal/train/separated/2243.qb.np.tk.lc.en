once upon a time , an evil queen
banished every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
to our world .
who knows the truth ?
and who can break the spell ?
you don &apos;t play with the curse .
emma , this is a mistake . i didn &apos;t kill kathryn .
she is a woman who &apos;s had her heart broken .
that can make you do unspeakable things .
ever seen this before ?
that &apos;s my jewelry box .
that &apos;s what we found the heart in .
the evidence is piling up by the hour .
okay , what are you saying ?
you should think about hiring a lawyer .
henry . what are you doing here ?
i came to congratulate you .
for what ?
your genius plan .
and what plan &apos;s that , henry ?
right .
sorry . i thought mr. gold was in on it
now that he &apos;s ms. blanchard &apos;s lawyer .
in on what ?
the escape plan .
the what ?
sheriff , could you join me , please ?
she &apos;s gone .
henry , what did you do ?
nothing . she was gone when i got here .
her arraignment &apos;s tomorrow . if she &apos;s not there--
she &apos;s a fugitive . doesn &apos;t matter if she &apos;s
convicted for kathryn or not , she &apos;s screwed .
i have to go find her before someone notices she &apos;s missing .
oh , you mean regina ?
the arraignment &apos;s at 8 : 00 a.m. i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be here
bright and early to celebrate her victory .
you have until 8 : 00 a.m. then .
uh , what about me ? how can i help ?
go home .
emma .
if she leaves storybrooke--
not now , henry . come on .
ms. swan , i know time is of the essence ,
but if ms. blanchard doesn &apos;t return ,
her future &apos;s in jeopardy ,
and if you &apos;re caught helping her ,
so is yours .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;d rather lose my job than my friend .
i &apos;m so sorry ! are you okay ?
i didn &apos;t see you there .
uh , i @-@ i think so .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not used to sharing the road with cars so late .
you &apos;re the sheriff , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
what brings you out here in the middle of the night ?
oh , nothing to worry about .
i &apos;m just looking for a lost dog .
well , i hope you find it .
thank you .
oh , you are hurt .
no , i just twisted my ankle , i think .
i live just a mile down the road . i &apos;ll make it okay .
no , let me drive you .
i insist .
thank you .
i &apos;m jefferson .
emma .
papa , i found you .
you certainly did .
you must be part bloodhound , my dear grace .
now it &apos;s my turn to hide and you seek .
i &apos;m afraid playtime &apos;s over .
though you can still use that nose of yours
to hunt mushrooms , enough to sell at market tomorrow .
do you think you can do that ?
ready or not , here we come .
wait .
whose carriage is that ?
the queen &apos;s .
in our house ?
do you know her ?
of course not .
now listen carefully . hey .
i want you to stay hidden in the woods ,
like our game .
i &apos;m gonna find out what she &apos;s doing here .
i &apos;d like to say you &apos;re looking well , jefferson ,
but i &apos;d be lying .
poverty doesn &apos;t suit you .
what are you doing here , regina ?
i have a job for you .
i don &apos;t do that anymore .
yes , i heard you hung up your hat . why ?
is it because of your sweet daughter grace ?
because of my work , she lost her mother .
i don &apos;t want her to lose her father , too .
so now you &apos;re foraging for fungus .
what kind of future does your daughter have here with you ?
do this one last favor for me ,
and you can give her the life she deserves .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m staying .
you don &apos;t abandon family .
that &apos;s ...
what she deserves .
now please leave .
all i need is your special skills to get me somewhere .
somewhere you &apos;ve been before .
do it , and i can change your life .
what business could you possibly have there ?
something of mine was taken and found its way over there .
i want it back .
then find someone else to get it .
i see .
hard living has strengthened your resolve .
well , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t convince you ,
but i understand .
there &apos;s nothing more important than family .
wow . this is your house ?
it looks more like a hotel .
you must have a huge family .
no . it &apos;s just me .
here . wait .
here we go .
i thought you might want to warm up for your search .
it &apos;s cold out there .
that is kind of you , but i think i should get back to it .
i know .
that &apos;s why i brought this .
i &apos;m a bit of an amateur cartographer .
mapping the area is a hobby .
maybe this will help you track down your dog .
what &apos;s his name ?
spot .
cute .
well , route 6 runs the boundary of the forest , so ...
so if i just follow that , i should ...
be able to ...
is something wrong ?
i &apos;m just , uh , feeling a little ...
oh . let me help you .
dizzy .
let &apos;s just lie you down here .
there you go .
let me get you some air .
your limp ...
that .
i guess you caught me .
who are you ?
the toy cart !
come .
wouldn &apos;t this make the perfect guest for our tea parties , papa ?
can i have him ? please ?
excuse me . how much for the rabbit ?
that costs one silver .
would you take it for 8 coppers ?
it &apos;s all i have .
oh , you are a good father .
your last coppers for your little girl &apos;s happiness , ah ?
thank you .
oh , i did not say i accept .
alas ,
i cannot take less than one silver .
the economy .
you understand .
make up your mind . come on . let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s okay , papa .
come on . people are waiting .
i will not take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
papa , please .
i don &apos;t need it .
come on , sweetie .
well , that was awfully cruel .
you could &apos;ve at least let the girl have her toy .
where &apos;s the fun in that ? hmm ?
i know it &apos;s not the same as what you wanted .
i love it , papa .
thank you .
this is really good .
don &apos;t you think so , mr. tortoise ?
papa .
do you like your tea ?
grace ...
i want you to go to the neighbors &apos; for the rest of the day .
there &apos;s work i have to do .
can &apos;t i come with you ?
i like being with you in the forest .
i &apos;m not going to the forest , sweetie .
this has to do with the queen &apos;s visit , doesn &apos;t it ?
whatever she wants you to do , don &apos;t do it .
grace , i have to .
i want you to have what you need .
all i need is you , papa .
please stay .
come here . i know .
i &apos;m sorry , baby . i have to go .
just promise me you &apos;ll come back .
you have to promise .
of course .
for our tea party .
promise ?
i promise .
i won &apos;t miss it for the world .
go .
emma .
help me .
emma .
what is going on ?
emma , thank god .
what are you doing here ?
i was in the woods , trying to get away .
this man appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me .
why are you here ?
i &apos;ve been trying to find you . you escaped , remember ?
how did you get out ?
there was a key ... in my cell , under my pillow .
someone put it there .
who ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;d like to know just as much as you .
i see you found &quot; spot . &quot;
i &apos;ve already called for backup . they &apos;ll be here any second .
you haven &apos;t called anybody ...
for the same reason you didn &apos;t tell me about her .
you don &apos;t want anybody to know you &apos;re here ,
which means nobody does .
so now tie her back up .
emma .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
your telescope .
you &apos;ve been watching me .
why ?
i need you to do something .
jefferson .
so good to see you looking more like yourself .
i assume you &apos;re here because you &apos;ve reconsidered my offer ?
i want your guarantee
that if i do what you ask ,
my daughter will want for nothing .
you have my word .
now let &apos;s open that box of yours
and see what it can do .
i do so like a man who dresses for the occasion .
step back .
after you !
together .
hold on !
i don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;re doing ,
but if you hurt my friend , i swear i &apos;ll make you regret it .
hurt her ?
i &apos;m saving her life .
how do you figure that ?
don &apos;t play stupid .
we both know what happens when people try to leave storybrooke .
what are you talking about ?
the curse .
what curse ?
the one keeping us all trapped .
all except you .
have you been reading henry &apos;s book ?
henry ?
you mean the queen &apos;s father ?
henry , the mayor &apos;s adopted kid .
oh , henry . your henry .
and his book of stories ,
the ones that you choose to ignore .
maybe if you knew what i know ,
you wouldn &apos;t .
why have you been spying on me ?
because for the last 28 years , i &apos;ve been stuck in this house ,
day after day ,
always the same ,
until one night , you ,
in your little yellow bug ,
roll into town ,
and the clock ticks and things start to change .
you see ...
i know what you refuse to acknowledge , emma .
you &apos;re special .
you brought something precious to storybrooke--
magic .
you &apos;re insane .
because i speak the truth ?
because you &apos;re talking about magic .
i &apos;m talking about what i &apos;ve seen .
perhaps you &apos;re the one that &apos;s mad .
really ?
what &apos;s crazier than seeing and not believing ?
because that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve been doing
since you got to our little hamlet .
open your eyes .
look around .
wake up .
isn &apos;t it about time ?
what do you want ?
i want you to get it to work .
you want me to get what to work ?
you &apos;re the only one that can do this .
and you &apos;re gonna get it to work .
i forgot how magnificent you are .
i &apos;m not here to relive the past .
i &apos;m here for my daughter .
here .
this is the entrance .
it &apos;s important that we stick together .
same amount of people that go through have to come back .
no more , no less .
it &apos;s the hat &apos;s rule , not mine .
i understand .
who are you ?
who ...
who ...
i hate wonderland .
make one like that .
you want me to make a hat ? you don &apos;t have enough ?
well , none of them work , do they ?
or else you wouldn &apos;t be here .
now make a hat and get it to work .
i don &apos;t--
you have magic . you can do it .
the hats ,
the tea ...
your psychotic behavior .
you think you &apos;re the mad hatter .
my name &apos;s jefferson .
okay .
you &apos;ve clearly glommed on to my kid henry &apos;s thing .
they &apos;re just stories .
the mad hatter is in &quot; alice in wonderland , &quot;
a book . a book i actually read .
stories .
stories ?
what &apos;s a story ?
when you were in high school , did you learn
about the civil war ?
yeah , of course .
how ? did you read about it , perchance , in a book ?
how is that any less real than any other book ?
history books are based on history .
and storybooks are based on what , imagination ?
where does that come from ?
it has to come from somewhere .
you know what the issue is with this world ?
everyone wants a magical solution for their problem ,
and everyone refuses to believe in magic .
now get it to work .
here &apos;s the thing , jefferson ,
this is it .
this is the real world .
a real world .
how arrogant are you to think yours is the only one ?
there are infinite more . you have to open your mind .
they touch one another , pressing up in a long line of lands ,
each just as real as the last . all have their own rules .
some have magic . some don &apos;t .
and some need magic ...
like this one .
and that &apos;s where you come in .
you and your friend are not leaving here
until you make my hat .
until you get it to work .
and then what ?
then i go home .
you want to go in there ?
what i want is a short walk through .
a short walk ?
you know who this belongs to .
the queen of hearts .
she &apos;s not one for subtlety .
this wasn &apos;t part of our deal .
you know what she does to anyone that crosses her .
indeed .
better than most .
you can &apos;t leave wonderland without me .
two go through . two go back .
you &apos;re not gonna let the queen of hearts
keep you from returning to your daughter , are you ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
wait .
stay away from the walls .
i &apos;ve got a better idea .
the walls should stay away from me .
okay ?
you got what you need . shall we ?
trespassers ! halt !
halt !
stop !
don &apos;t let them get away !
the looking glass . there it is !
come ... what are you doing ? we can &apos;t stop now .
we gotta get out of here .
there &apos;s something i need to do first .
a little snack .
are you mad ?
do you know what the food here does ?
i &apos;m well aware .
oh , daddy .
this is what she took from you ?
your father ?
the queen of hearts has always seen me as a threat .
so she wanted some leverage .
i got it back .
the queen &apos;s soldiers . we must hurry .
you knew only two can go through the hat .
which is why you didn &apos;t tell me about your father .
it was the only way to make sure you &apos;d help me .
uhh ! wait ! wait !
please .
my daughter ...
my grace--she &apos;s--
she &apos;s waiting for me .
i promised her i &apos;d be home for tea .
a promise which you now have broken .
if you truly cared for your daughter ,
you never would &apos;ve left her in the first place .
you were right , jefferson .
you don &apos;t abandon family .
no !
no .
take him to the queen .
her majesty says she knows you &apos;re responsible
for helping to steal from her .
the queen . she tricked--
that woman &apos;s name is regina .
there is only one queen--
the queen of hearts .
yes , of course . my apologies .
now please ...
her majesty wishes to know how you got to this world .
how did you come to wonderland ?
if i tell you ,
will you let me go home to my daughter ?
off with his head .
no .
i &apos;m alive ?
i &apos;m alive !
if you wish your body back ,
then answer .
how did you get here ?
the--the---the hat . my hat .
we used my hat .
where &apos;s the hat now ?
she took it .
regina .
if all you require to travel to your homeland
is this magic hat , then surely , you could make another .
i can &apos;t .
a hat without magic is just a hat .
it won &apos;t work .
then there &apos;s your task .
get it to work .
i can &apos;t make it work .
what you &apos;re asking me is impossible .
no ! it has to be .
if it &apos;s not , i &apos;m never going home .
i &apos;ll be cursed to live in this house forever .
what is so cursed about your life ?
look at this place . it &apos;s beautiful .
it doesn &apos;t seem cursed to me .
it &apos;s cursed because like everyone else here ,
what i love has been ripped from me .
take a look .
her name is grace .
here it &apos;s paige .
but it &apos;s grace .
my grace .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like
to watch her day in and day out ,
happy ,
with a new family ,
with a new father ?
you think she &apos;s your daughter ?
i don &apos;t think .
i know .
i remember .
she has no idea who i am ,
our life together ,
where we come from .
i do .
that &apos;s my curse .
to remember .
what good is this house , these things ,
if i can &apos;t share them with her ?
if you really think she &apos;s your daughter ,
why don &apos;t you reach out to her ? why don &apos;t you tell her ?
and destroy her reality ?
i &apos;m trapped by knowledge .
how cruel do you think i am ?
you think i &apos;d inflict that awareness on my daughter ?
it &apos;s hard enough to live in a land where you don &apos;t belong ,
but knowing it ,
holding conflicting realities in your head ...
will drive you mad .
that &apos;s why you want me to make the hat work , isn &apos;t it ?
you just wanna take grace home ,
to your world .
it &apos;s the one world where we can be together ...
where she &apos;ll remember who i am .
i know what it &apos;s like to be separated from your kid .
yeah , you too , don &apos;t you ?
it can make you feel like you &apos;re losing your mind .
i &apos;m not losing my mind .
i &apos;m not crazy .
this is real .
maybe .
maybe it is .
you believe ?
if what you say is true ,
that woman in the other room
is my mother .
and i want to believe that more than anything in the world .
so maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i need to open myself up more .
maybe if i want magic ,
i have to start believing .
so you &apos;re gonna help me ?
you can get it to work ?
i can try .
crazy son of a bitch .
hey . it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here . you &apos;re gonna be okay .
he can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
emma , look out !
off with his head .
are you okay ?
yeah .
there &apos;s no sign of him anywhere .
who was he ?
a very lonely man .
by the way , have you been taking kickboxing
and not telling me about it ?
i have no idea where that came from .
emma , look .
so , sheriff , i guess you &apos;ll be taking me back now .
here . go .
you want me to run ?
no , but it &apos;s your choice .
just know something--
running ain &apos;t easy . i &apos;ve done my share of it .
and once you go , there &apos;s no stopping .
emma , everyone thinks i killed kathryn .
mary margaret , you have to believe me .
you have to trust me .
i know it seems impossible , but i can get you out of this .
why is it so important to you what happens to me ?
because when regina framed me , and you bailed me out ,
i asked you why , and you said you trusted me .
and then when i wanted to leave storybrooke
&apos;cause i thought it was best for henry ,
you told me i needed to stay
because that was the best for him .
and i realized , all my life , i have been alone .
walls up .
nobody &apos;s ever been there for me except for you .
and i can &apos;t lose that . i cannot lose my family .
family ?
friends .
whatever .
you know what i mean .
wouldn &apos;t you rather face this together than alone ?
the arraignment .
regina .
madame mayor .
good morning .
excuse me , but my client is not having any visitors .
of course not .
i &apos;ll see you out .
what is she doing here ?
she came back .
you said this was going to work ,
that she &apos;d take the key , that she &apos;d go .
and she did .
but it seems that ms. swan is
rather more resourceful than we thought .
fear not , your majesty .
ms. blanchard is still guilty of murder .
you may yet get what you want .
oh , i better .
the only reason i made a deal with you , gold ,
is because i wanted results .
and results you shall have .
see you at the arraignment .
henry .
well . i found mary margaret .
how is she ?
she &apos;s okay .
other than being on trial for murder , she &apos;s fine .
hi , henry .
who is that ?
her name is paige . she goes to school with me .
henry , do you have your storybook with you ?
can i see it ?
yeah . why ?
i &apos;m just curious about something .
what ?
what is it ?
nothing .
get it to work . get it to work . get it to work .
get it to work ! get it to work !
get it to work . get it to work . just get it to work .
get it to work . get it to work . get it to work . get it to work .
get it to work . get it to work . get it to work .
get it to work . get it to work .
get it to work !
emma ?
emma ?
i gotta go .
right . can i hold on to this ?
