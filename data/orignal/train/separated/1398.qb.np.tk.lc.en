giving them the freedom to be whatever they want to be .

whether that &apos;s a painter ,
a poet , a pilot , a president-
and for us , we &apos;re gonna
of a company or of a country .

we caravanned that house . great , uh , deck .

no , who is coconuts enough to divorce you ?
we gotta go , but we &apos;ll see you around .
we &apos;ll have to have you over sometime .
i &apos;d love it .
all right .
bye .
bye .
she &apos;s awesome .
no , we are never having her over .
heard she already slept with two dads from the school .
what ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that &apos;s horrible .
dad , watch out !
whoa ! watch it , buddy !
grandma .
i &apos;m sorry .
that still looks like a girl &apos;s bike .
we &apos;ll add more black tape .
my son has been riding his sister &apos;s old bike .
until he &apos;s responsible enough to take care of his own bike .
look , he spilled a soda on my computer ,
he ruined our digital camera
taking pictures of himself underwater .
it &apos;s a girl &apos;s bike . i &apos;m all for teaching him a lesson .
but i worry about the ridicule he might get from some loudmouth bully .
hey , hey , hey . nice bike , sally .
dad !
come on . he looks like little bo peep on that thing .
actually , not for long . he &apos;s getting a new bike this afternoon .
i am ?
mm @-@ hmm .
he is ?
sometimes a man &apos;s gotta put his foot down
and do what a man &apos;s gotta do .
and if the old lady don &apos;t like it-
honey ?
that &apos;s too damn bad .
yes . who &apos;s excited , huh ?
cam , come on . hurry up . we &apos;re gonna be late .
it &apos;s a toddler play class , not a flight to cabo .
we &apos;re gonna be judged enough as the only gay parents there .
i don &apos;t wanna be the late ones too .
wow ! paisley and pink .
was there something wrong with the fishnet tank top ?
obviously not . i &apos;m wearing it underneath .
kidding . just chill , please . here .
i &apos;m sorry . i just wanna make a good first impression .
you wanna fit in and not terrify the villagers ?
hey , come on .
today is about lily , all right ?
her future best friend might be in that class ,
and i don &apos;t wanna rub anyone the wrong way .
can you please just change your shirt ?
fine . you know what ?
i &apos;ll just go put on a pair of khakis ,
maybe a polo shirt , and everybody will think
we &apos;re a couple straight golfin &apos; buddies ...
who just decided to have a kid together .
hey , i called that place in napa and
got us upgraded to a villa with a hot tub .
so pack whatever you wear in a hot tub .
i usually wear nothing when i &apos;m in a hot tub .
and my college roommate &apos;s wife just had to get a new hip .
sucker .
manny &apos;s father is taking him for a couple of days to disneyland ,
so we &apos;re gonna go to the wine country .
we &apos;re gonna drink some wine , eat some good food .
you know , we would do something like this
a lot more often if it wasn &apos;t for , you know , manny .
he &apos;s good . he keep us grounded .
yeah .
like fog at an airport .
limo gets here at 4 : 00 .
this morning , i thought i &apos;d go to the club , hit a few balls .
no ! what about the fan in manny &apos;s room ?
0h , yeah . call a guy .
no ! you &apos;re supposed to do it with him .
it &apos;s important that we teach him how to do things for himself .
in my culture , men take great pride in doing physical labor .
i know . that &apos;s why i hire people from your culture .
you &apos;re too funny .
i &apos;m gonna share that one with my next husband
when we &apos;re spending all your money .
dad , this is the coolest bike ever .
awesome .
so , listen , buddy .
certain members of this family
don &apos;t think you can take care of this bad boy .
you mean mom ?
your words , not mine .
look , uh , your mom and i are a team ,
and she- we feel like this is a chance
for you to show some responsibility .
don &apos;t make us look like jerks here .
i won &apos;t .
okay .
one more rule .
what ?
have , like , three butt @-@ loads of fun .
thanks , dad .
so let &apos;s do this .
0kay , but i need to be done by 3 : 00 .
that &apos;s when my dad &apos;s picking me up .
hey , if we &apos;re not done by 3 : 00,
i &apos;m gonna tie a noose on this thing .
in colombia there &apos;s a saying :
&quot; if you have two stubborn burros that don &apos;t like each other ,
you tie them to the same cart . &quot;
the ceiling fan is the cart .
my dad &apos;s taking me on space mountain .
it &apos;s supposed to be really fast , but he &apos;s not scared of anything .
he doesn &apos;t even wear a seat belt when he drives .
wow . how &apos; bout that ?
killed a bear once .
really ?
was the bear sittin &apos; in the passenger seat ?
read me the instructions .
&quot; safety tips . warning : to reduce the risk of electrical shock &quot; -
we can skip that .
uh , &quot; failure to heed these warnings
can lead to serious injury or death . &quot;
you know , you worry too much . you know that .
nobody &apos;s gonna get shocked .
one time my dad was struck by lightning .
that &apos;s why he can drink as much as he wants .
manny thinks his dad is like superman .
the truth ? he &apos;s a total flake .
in fact , the only way he &apos;s like superman ...
is that they both landed in this country illegally .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m so nervous .
they &apos;re gonna love us . let &apos;s just be ourselves .
0r a slightly toned @-@ down version of ourselves .
i just don &apos;t want this to become an episode of &quot; the cam show . &quot;
0h , my gosh . people love &quot; the cam show . &quot;
yes , i know .
you watch &quot; the cam show . &quot;
i do watch it .
it &apos;s appointment viewing .
okay .
hi !
hi ! are you here for toddler time ?
yes . i @-@ i &apos;m mitchell . this is cameron .
and this here is lily .
hello .
0h , well ! welcome .
we &apos;re all over here taking turns blowing bubbles .
well , how nice for ... the babies .
mm @-@ hmm .
this is gonna be really difficult .
ten minutes after making a promise to me ,
he leaves his bike unlocked .
all i can hear is claire &apos;s voice in my head-
&quot; he &apos;s not responsible .
you never should have given him a bike . &quot;
i know . i do a pretty good claire .
so i decided to teach him a lesson ...
and let him think his bike was stolen .
and i know that sounds kind of rough ,
but sometimes it &apos;s a dad &apos;s job to be the tough guy .
excuse me ! thank you .
on your left ! my left . your right !
everyone , we have a new family joining us today .
hi . i &apos;m , uh , mitchell , and i am a lawyer .
i- i &apos;m cameron , and i &apos;m currently not working ,
which gives me more time to grill and shoot baskets and-
and this is lily .
okay , we &apos;re gonna start with the hello dance ,
and then we &apos;re gonna move on to blocks , then finger painting ,
and then we &apos;re gonna do our family dance .
all right . who wants to start us off ?
dance us in , p. j. !
she &apos;s adorable .
oh , thank you .
seven months ?
uh , eight .
0h ! is she grabbing or scooting yet ?
yes . absolutely .
i mean , when she &apos;s not grabbin &apos; , she is- she is scootin &apos; .
dance us in , tyler !
are you ready ? okay . here we go .
cam , lily is not grabbing or scooting yet .
well , she &apos;s not doing it yet , but she will eventually .
no , but , see , a lot of these other kids ,
they &apos;re- they &apos;re grabbing .
i @-@ i just- here . come-
lily . look at the block , huh ?
grab the block , lily .
grab the &quot; h. &quot;
dance us in , lily !
okay . i got this .
cam , just-
yes , i know . tamp down my natural gifts
and dance like a straight guy .
no slapping your own butt .
but that &apos;s how i make my horsey go .
thank you .
that was very good .
i feel dirty .
0h , hey .
hey ! hi .
hi .
hi .
uh , this is really embarrassing ,
but i locked myself out of my house .
0h ! pssh ! i do that all the time . don &apos;t be embarrassed .
i was- i was hoping you could help me .
there &apos;s a window open , but i can &apos;t reach it .
would you mind ?
yeah . yeah . sure .
great .
0f course . you know what they say-
&quot; every time god closes a door , he opens a window . &quot;
0r i guess in this case , every time he locks you out .
okay , what do we got here ?
i mean , am i attracted to her ? yes .
would i ever act on it ? no . no way .
not while my wife is still alive .
are you sure i can &apos;t get you something to drink ?
yeah . no , i &apos;m- i &apos;m fine . really .
if i knew a man was gonna climb into my bedroom window ,
i would have cleaned up a bit .
are you kidding me ? it smelled great in there .
like lotions and oils ...
for ... dry skin and , you know , calloused hands .
yeah , it &apos;s a candle .
uh @-@ oh .
what &apos;s wrong ?
the bike &apos;s gone .
oh , no .
can i help you find it ?
that &apos;s all right . thank you .
0kay . thank you !
so , to teach him a lesson , i took his bike ,
and then- crazy thing-
i put it down for one minute , and someone swiped it from me .
maybe that was your dad teaching you a lesson .
zinger .
so , any chance i could , uh , get a break on this one ?
i can throw in a bell .
deal .
for five dollars .
no , sir .
so , you wanna go for the insurance this time ,
or is it still for suckers ?
got me again .
well played , milord .
i will take some insurance . thank you .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
that &apos;s not step four .
don &apos;t worry about it .
it says right here that you should-
that &apos;s worrying about it .
i thought you guys might need a drink .
0h , you have no idea .
manny , miamor , i have to go get some stuff for our trip .
ay ! but have some fun with your father , okay ?
and i &apos;ll see you monday . mwah !
it makes me so happy to see my two boys working together .
jay shocked himself twice .
0kay , manny .
well , i warned him .
yep , he &apos;s been a big help .
look at you two with your private jokes already .
you &apos;re a regular salazar and el oso .
it &apos;s a very big comedy team in colombia .
el oso is always hitting salazar in the head
with the ladder and things .
and sometimes they wear dresses . hmm .
they make you laugh , but they also make you think .
you blew it . you made me look bad .
no , you made your mother and i look bad . we are a team .
luke , you in there ?
hey , dad .
hey . hey , buddy .
that was , uh- that was pretty fun today , huh ? getting a new bike .
yeah , it was awesome .
so , uh , what happened after i took off ?
anything you want to share with me ?
not really .
so , if i , uh , went out to the garage ,
took a picture for a scrapbook , there &apos;d be no surprises ?
i &apos;m so sorry ! i didn &apos;t mean it . i just made a mistake .
yeah , a big mistake !
you &apos;re making me look really bad here .
i told mom you were ready for this .
it &apos;s just a scratch , dad .
that &apos;s not the point , luke ! what ?
i scratched it on my way into the driveway . i &apos;m sorry .
so , it &apos;s not stolen ?
no . why ?
that &apos;s good ,
&apos;cause ... there are bad people out there who would steal a bike .
those are thieves .
you sit there and think about the scratch part .
that &apos;s not good either .
i gotta fix that step .
so don &apos;t scratch anything while i &apos;m gone ,
unless it itches . that &apos;s different .
the good news is , luke has his bike .
more good news-
i taught some random kid a valuable lesson by stealing his bike .
best news- claire knows nothing .
so , i figure i &apos;ll just dump the new bike
where i stole the first bike .
that way , random kid gets his back ,
and this new bike doesn &apos;t raise a lot of embarrassing questions ...
like why i had it
or who boosted who through a bedroom window .
so , everybody &apos;s happy .
ah , son of a- you gave me the wrong screwdriver .
maybe you &apos;re just using it wrong .
my dad &apos;s great with tools .
he can get the wheels off a car in less than a minute .
just get me to wine country . just get me to wine country .
sorry !
i think my arm is broken .
relax . it &apos;s not broken .
how do you know ? you don &apos;t know anything .
you have no concern for safety .
because it didn &apos;t hit you that hard .
why don &apos;t you just say it ?
you don &apos;t want me around .
you know what ? right now , i don &apos;t !
i don &apos;t wanna be with you either . i &apos;m gonna go wait for my dad .
0h , but- but if you leave , how will i ever finish ?
you know what ? i wish you never married my mom .
i hate living here .
you think i like this arrangement ?
i got a two @-@ seater parked in the driveway !
i mean , i don &apos;t understand .
why are you trying to sneak around and hide things from me ?
i actually think it &apos;s pretty funny .
you do ?
i do . yes .
i mean , you steal a bike from some poor kid ,
and then the bike gets stolen from you .
it &apos;s hilarious .
classic me , right ?
yeah !
so , where were you when it got stolen ?
oh , i was getting some gas .
uh @-@ huh . you don &apos;t stand near the car when you get gas ?
yep , but , uh , i went inside to get a soda
because i was thirsty ,
and if i had a soda , i wouldn &apos;t be thirsty anymore .
so i bought one , then i drank it all right there ,
which is why i don &apos;t have the can .
well , honey , please , let &apos;s try to remember
that i &apos;m your wife , not your mom .
so in the future , you don &apos;t need to hide things from me . okay ?
0kay .
okay .
0kay .
oh ! oh , yeah .
you get back here , you !
what are you doing , phil ?
i just love ya so darn much !
i know . i love you too , but that hurts .
let &apos;s get you inside .
hi .
i know . that &apos;s hurting a lot .
this is a hot one .
hello ! hi there !
hi again .
oh , hi .
i , uh , found your bike .
oh , good ! you-
at the gas station ?
no , at my house .
one of my neighbors saw it and put it in my garage
when you were in my bedroom , so-
classic me ?
come on , honey . grab the block .
see , like he did . you gotta do that .
you gotta grab it like him .
so , seen any movies lately ?
uh , yeah .
you know , my husband and i just rented ,
uh , mamma mia ! which i liked ,
but i don &apos;t know that meryl streep was the right choice .
what did you think ?
excuse me .
meryl streep could play batman and be the right choice .
she &apos;s perfection ...
whether she &apos;s divorcing kramer , whether she &apos;s wearing prada .
don &apos;t even get me started on sophie &apos;s choice .
i get emotional thinking about it .
she couldn &apos;t forgive herself .
i guess she was okay .
really ? ooh .
grab the blocks , sweetheart .
you &apos;re not even interested in it .
is henry stacking ?
good job , henry !
good job !
q @-@ r @-@ s t @-@ u @-@ v
w @-@ x @-@ y and z
now i know my-
whoa , lily ! oh !
not so high . wow !
that is a big moment for her .
yeah .
would you like a videotape ?
uh , you know , i don &apos;t-
i don &apos;t know if i can actually get her to do it again , so-
well , we tape all of our classes .
we don &apos;t like parents bringing cameras in .
it keeps them out of the moment .
i &apos;ll get you a copy after class .
that &apos;s super . yeah . great . thank you .
cam . cam , let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened to me ,
but i just stole a baby &apos;s intellectual property .
what ?
you &apos;ll see it tonight on the news .
come on . let &apos;s just go .
oh , look who &apos;s here !
anton and scott !
sorry we &apos;re late !
don &apos;t look at me . the eye candy here can &apos;t leave the house ...
without spending 20 minutes in front of the mirror .
are you kidding me ?
i am so sorry .
look at those queens . i would have killed with this crowd .
but you had to clip my wings-
which you used to be the wind beneath .
i know . i &apos;m sor-
this class has turned me into a complete monster .
i &apos;m- i &apos;m just- i &apos;ll make it up to you . let &apos;s just go .
okay , it &apos;s time for parents dance .
everybody dance for your baby !
you wanna do it , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
i wanna dance for my baby .
all right . go on . get in there .
you sure ?
make that horsey move . go ahead .
go , go !
0h , i think i hurt myself .
hello . hey , javier .
manny &apos;s waiting for you outside .
what ? why not ?
hold that thought .
his son &apos;s sitting on a curb , waiting to go to disneyland ,
and superman can &apos;t drag himself away from a craps table ,
and i &apos;m the jerk .
say , listen .
i , uh-
sorry , but i got some bad news .
what ?
your dad couldn &apos;t make it .
why not ?
the plane was full ,
and this old lady needed to get home , so he gave up his seat .
you &apos;re making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
he just didn &apos;t want to come .
are you kidding me ? he was very upset . he was dying to see you .
in fact , look what he sent .
a limo ?
yeah .
he wanted me and your mom to take you to disneyland .
i told you he was an awesome dad .
yeah , he &apos;s a prince .
okay . the key to being a good dad ?
sometimes things work out just the way you want .
race you to the end .
that is not a good idea ... for you .
sometimes they don &apos;t .
you gotta hang in there .
because when all is said and done ,
90 % of being a dad ...
is just showin &apos; up .
hey ! that &apos;s my bike !
oh , i don &apos;t , uh-
well-
you-
i was giving it back !
she couldn &apos;t forgive herself .
and ...
she had to choose .
i think because now i have-
we have- we have-
we have lily ,
it &apos;s so hard to imagine being put in that position .
if i had to choose lily or mitchell ,
i mean , i would choose-
i don &apos;t know ! i don &apos;t know !
i don &apos;t know !
i don &apos;t know !
