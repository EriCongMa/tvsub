it &apos;s &quot; h @-@ o-- , &quot; &quot; h @-@ a @-@ w @-@ t-- &quot;
guys .
what happened ?
apparently they found him unconscious
on a park bench .
oh , my god .
is he okay ?
we don &apos;t know . we just got here .
he &apos;s ready for visitors now .
he &apos;s in 1023 .
oh , welcome , my old friends .
welcome .
pierce , what happened ?
we were all so worried .
it was the pills .
they just took me over .
i saw awful , horrible things ,
demons , aliens ,
critters 3 , something called bruce willis surrogates .
abed , what are you guys doing ?
it &apos;s okay . just act natural .
pierce asked me to document his life
for historical purposes .
at first , i said , &quot; no , &quot;
because at the risk of sounding overly sensitive ,
i feel intensely bored by pierce as a subject .
but i &apos;m excited about the narrative facility
of the documentary format .
it &apos;s easier to tell a complex story
when you can just cut to people
explaining things to the camera .
i &apos;ve called everyone here so that i could
put my house in order ,
bequeath parting gifts , say my final words
to each of you .
final words ?
you &apos;re gonna kill us ?
no , dummy .
the pills wiped me out .
i &apos;m dying .
oh .
i &apos;m not really dying .
over the last few weeks , it &apos;s become apparent
how little respect this group has for me .
so i &apos;ve summoned them here to exact my revenge .
see ? fish in a barrel .
第二季 第十六集
i &apos;m so sad . i don &apos;t know what to do .
usually , if i need to cheer up ,
i just make fun of pierce , but now ...
it &apos;d just make me sadder .
it &apos;s gregory hines all over again .
look , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be fine .
you know how dramatic pierce gets .
remember when he had the hiccups
and pulled the fire alarm ?
let &apos;s just try to relax .
he &apos;s here because we relaxed .
no , he &apos;s here because he relaxed ,
a handful of pills at a time .
that &apos;s all over now .
we &apos;re here for him , so there &apos;s no point
in feeling bad .
we know there &apos;s no point , jeff .
we kind of just felt like feeling it .
yeah , jeff . what are you ? abed ?
oh , sorry , abed .
no problem . doesn &apos;t bother me .
mr. hawthorne is ready to commence his bequeathings .
shouldn &apos;t you be telling that to an orderly ?
he &apos;s gonna give us gifts .
oh , cool !
i mean ...
cool .
i don &apos;t want pierce to die .
but if i &apos;m gonna get bequeathed upon ,
i &apos;d like to be bequeathed a drum kit
or a signed photo of actor levar burton .
those would be my top two wishes .
my third wish would be a million wishes .
but i &apos;d just use &apos; em all on
a million signed photos of actor levar burton .
hello , pierce .
hi .
i got you some things from the gift shop
to cheer you up .
i got you a john grisham novel
and a funny little coffee mug .
you see how the flea &apos;s door mat says
&quot; dog , sweet dog &quot; ?
yeah . shirley , we both know
that you and i are the most hated in the group .
we do ?
and since , in my absence ,
you &apos;ll be the new black sheep--
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s offensive .
black swan .
i want you to have this .
it &apos;s a compact record and it
contains an audio file of your study group
talking about you while you &apos;re out of the room .
it &apos;s all here , burnt into this diskette
by optical lasers .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i know it sounds like science fiction .
no , i don &apos;t believe there &apos;s anything on that .
then i guess this is good @-@ bye ... forever .
good--good @-@ bye , pierce .
smell you later .
he said it &apos;s a recording of you all
talking behind my back .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
that &apos;s what i told him ,
because you all don &apos;t do that .
right ?
mr. hawthorne is requesting &quot; sour face . &quot;
knock , knock .
is that you , death ?
it &apos;s britta .
oh .
before you speak , i just want to tell you
that you don &apos;t have to give me anything .
i am happy to just spend time with you .
you know what dylan thomas said about death ?
no , tell me .
okay , bluff called .
britta , you &apos;re the selfless one in the group , right ?
i wouldn &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t thought about myself in years .
that &apos;s what makes you the perfect recipient
of this bequeathment .
it &apos;s a check for $ 10,000
with the payee line blank ,
so that you can give it to the charity of your choice .
pierce , this is ... surprising .
after what you gave shirley ,
we thought you were playing mind games .
thank you .
of course , if you are so inclined ,
you could always write your own name in there .
toodles .
i don &apos;t want to die in a place like this .
people shouldn &apos;t die in the same place as people magazines do .
i hope to die surrounded by my family .
that &apos;s the only way i agreed to be surrounded by my family .
me and abed have an agreement .
if one of us dies , we stage it to look like a suicide
caused by the unjust cancellation of firefly .
we &apos;re gonna get that show back on the air , buddy .
how &apos;d it go ?
huh ?
oh , fine .
he gave me a check for $ 10,000
to give to the charity of my choice .
see ? he &apos;s not messing with us .
maybe he just hates shirley .
what ?
yeah , maybe .
i just need to research a few charities ,
because some take a lot off the top
and you think you &apos;re giving money to people that really need it ,
and you &apos;re really giving it to some middle man
who &apos;s gonna pay off their parking tickets ,
credit cards , and keep from getting kicked out
of her place in ... april .
he &apos;d like to see annie next .
you know what ? no .
he &apos;ll see jeff next .
no , but you &apos;re not supposed to go--
or what ? you &apos;ll do twice as much work as a doctor
for half the pay ?
thank you ?
it &apos;s called a complisult .
part compliment , part insult .
he invented them . i coined the term .
see what i just did there ?
that was an explanabrag .
hello , jeffrey .
pierce .
i &apos;ve thought about this day many times ,
but i &apos;ve always imagined it differently .
for starters , i thought you &apos;d be the one in bed
and i &apos;d be a hologram .
what ?
ah , never mind . there &apos;s no time for that now .
pierce , it &apos;s starting to seem ,
from observing the others , that you &apos;re using
the social leverage afforded you by your alleged deathbed
to exact complicated acts of psychological vengeance
on those closest to you .
vengeance ? oh , no .
i was never one to hold a grudge , jeffrey .
my father held grudges .
i &apos;ll always hate him for that .
did you get along with your father ?
i got along without him .
oh , that &apos;s no good , jeffrey .
you don &apos;t want your dad to die
before you tell him how you feel .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
look , let &apos;s nip this in the bud .
pierce , we &apos;re sorry we didn &apos;t respond
quickly enough to your pill addiction .
is there any chance that apology is enough ?
are you ready to be bequeathed upon , jeff ?
yeah .
blow my mind .
i found your father .
did you now ?
william winger , born oklahoma city , 1945 .
1974 , married doreen fitzgerald .
divorced in 1983 .
most recently residing in dorchester .
currently sitting in a town car on its way to this very hospital .
should be here in an hour or so ,
give or take a father .
that it ?
yep .
all right .
see you at the funeral .
and so it is bequeathed .
what are you gonna say to your dad ?
i &apos;m not gonna say anything because i won &apos;t have to ,
because pierce is playing head games with us .
i &apos;ve decided not to listen to it .
what ?
i &apos;m not gonna listen to the cd
of you guys talking about me .
because i forgive you .
but how do we know what we &apos;re being forgiven for ?
we don &apos;t even know what &apos;s on there .
and you never have to .
but what if he is coming , though ?
what are you gonna say to him ?
here . i &apos;ll be him . i &apos;ll be him .
hi . hey .
hi , i &apos;m jeff &apos;s dad . hi .
hi . hi , jeff &apos;s dad .
i &apos;m britta &apos;s dad .
what ? why ?
i don &apos;t know .
got drunk , didn &apos;t have a condom ,
and her mom gets freaky when she hears oingo boingo .
oh , god , i wish i could relate ,
but much like my son , i &apos;m a closet homosexual .
don &apos;t apologize for that .
you &apos;re talking to the guy that banged britta &apos;s mom .
i have no standards .
well , what do you say we take a tumble ?
i &apos;ll put on a wig .
that &apos;s it . you &apos;re under arrest .
i &apos;m an undercover cop .
it &apos;s not illegal to be gay .
it is here in iran .
not when we &apos;re in the green zone .
that &apos;s iraq , stupid .
well , what do i know ?
i &apos;m jeff winger &apos;s dumb , gay dad .
my father was a two @-@ bit con man of so little substance
he couldn &apos;t leave a trail if he wanted to .
and i don &apos;t care if pierce hired scotland yard .
he isn &apos;t gonna track him down from a hospital bed .
i mean , money can &apos;t just make people appear .
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for troy barnes .
pierce hawthorne sent me .
hey , troy ?
hi .
i &apos;m levar burton .
pierce got levar burton to come here for troy ?
is there anyone he can &apos;t produce ?
now i &apos;m really getting mad .
why am i the only one he decided to torture ?
i told pierce a thousand times
i never wanted to meet levar in person !
i just wanted a picture !
you can &apos;t disappoint a picture !
i hate you , pierce !
i hate you so much !
annie , i forgive you .
annie edison .
your bequeathal is at hand .
do you have a regular job here ?
annie , i know you &apos;re being strong for me .
i give you permission to weep .
i &apos;m crying on the inside .
gross .
well , in any case ,
i want to give you this .
it &apos;s been in my family for six generations .
now it &apos;s yours .
thank you .
jeff , do you want to see your dad ?
he &apos;s not coming .
but do you want to see him ?
no .
then why aren &apos;t you leaving ?
because i don &apos;t care and i &apos;m not
gonna let him think that i care .
your dad or pierce ?
there is no dad .
and get this thing out of my face !
and don &apos;t you dare intercut this
with footage of me freaking out .
is there footage of you freaking out ?
abed , i &apos;m gonna kill you
and pierce and britta
and anyone else who thinks i care about any of this !
so do you go to school nearby ?
well , are you more familiar with me
from star trek or reading rainbow ?
reading rainbow was a show i hosted and produced
for 25 years on pbs .
ever seen it ?
* butterfly in the sky *
* i can go twice as high *
* take a look *
* it &apos;s in a book *
* reading rainbow @-@ ow @-@ ow *
* reading rainbow *
* set phasers to &quot; love me &quot; ! *
what does it mean ?
what do you mean &quot; what does it mean &quot; ?
no riddles .
you &apos;re screwing around with everyone .
you gave me a tiara . what does it mean ?
are these--are these blood diamonds ?
are they holocaust diamonds ?
no !
well , what does it mean ?
it means you &apos;re my favorite .
what does that mean ?
i did it .
i gave away the money .
the red cross .
you know what that makes me ?
a terrible person .
because if that camera wasn &apos;t on me ,
i would have taken that money
right out of the mouths of crippled ,
starving , malaria @-@ ridden refugee kids
and now i know that forever .
thanks , pierce .
britta , you &apos;ve got to forgive yourself .
look at me .
i &apos;ve forgiven all of you for the horrible things--
oh , for crying out loud , shirley , give me that cd .
oh !
we &apos;re gonna listen to it .
i don &apos;t want to listen to it .
britta , please . britta .
britta , wait .
britta !
i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t learn anything without me .
so how much do we all hate shirley ?
pierce , knock it off .
hey , james bond , stop trying to record us
with that stupid spy pen .
we can see the blinking light .
why do you keep trying to record us
bad @-@ mouthing each other ?
because he thinks friendship is a competition
and he &apos;s always trying to get the upper hand .
think shirley &apos;s any different ?
yes .
moron .
guess we do owe you an apology , shirley .
we shouldn &apos;t have said those things about you .
i guess the lesson here is
that i sometimes use guilt as a weapon .
what are you doing ?
oh , just shooting a talking head
or did you want me to be the only one .
who didn &apos;t have one ?
no , go ahead .
i think it stems from when i was--
so you found my father ?
yes , he &apos;s on his way .
i mean , if this is too much to handle ,
i completely understand and i can call it off .
actually , i think i &apos;m ready to see him .
good . good for you .
oh , i should probably tell you ...
if you &apos;re lying to me , if my father isn &apos;t coming ,
if a car pulls up and anyone other than my father
steps out--say , an actor or you in a wig--
if you try to pull any ferris bueller ,
parent trap , three &apos;s company , f / x ,
the deadly art of illusion bull ,
i will beat you ...
and there will be nothing madcap or wacky about it .
understood ?
crystal .
i &apos;m levar .
oh , i know .
i was a huge fan of rebop .
it was cancelled before i was born ,
but i scored some vhs copies .
i was nostalgic from a very early age .
cool .
hey , you know , i assumed that troy was a fan ,
but he hasn &apos;t said a word to me since i got here
and now i &apos;ve got to catch this flight .
no ! no ! you can &apos;t go .
he loves you .
he talks about you all the time .
how much would it cost to change your flight till tomorrow ?
is , um , $ 261 enough ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got ?
yeah .
no , you--you keep your money .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll reschedule .
oh , my god . thank you .
he &apos;s gonna be so happy .
you know , you are a very generous friend ,
but you &apos;re really stupid with your money .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;m selfish .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m really stupid with my money ,
which is why i &apos;ll never have a lot of it
and because i &apos;m a really generous friend .
problem solved .
dilemma deleted .
britta for the win !
oh , thank god he didn &apos;t take it .
could you imagine bouncing a check to kunta kinte ?
hello ?
jeffrey , this is your father .
uh @-@ huh ?
it &apos;s me here in this sedan .
see ? i &apos;m waving .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t come any closer , my boy .
this is too difficult .
you look too much like your mother .
no , no . don &apos;t come any closer .
as you were .
well , have to catch a flight to katmandu ,
but i just wanted to say cherish the new friends that you &apos;ve made .
they &apos;re your true family now !
no ! don &apos;t open it !
it &apos;ll be too hard for both of us !
oh , jeff !
jeff !
son of a ...
jeff !
no , no , no !
when you improvise a plan ,
sometimes you hit a speed bump .
and sometimes you hit it so hard
that you soar through the air ,
far beyond your initial expectations .
i set out to take revenge on jeff winger ,
to scare him with the ghost of his father .
instead , i took over the role of his father ,
and helped make him a better man .
it &apos;ll be a long time before jeff winger
underestimates me again .
jeff , no !
why would you do something like this ?
jeff ! come on , jeff !
i &apos;m sick of you people
not taking me seriously !
you forget my birthday !
you don &apos;t invite me to your dungeons and dragons games
or your secret trampoline !
you guys think i &apos;m some kind of a joke !
this isn &apos;t disproving the theory !
good point .
what &apos;d you say ? what &apos;d you say ?
what did you say ?
apparently i need to say some things to my father .
things that i may have screamed at pierce instead .
i &apos;m not saying he doesn &apos;t deserve it .
but my father deserves it too .
pierce ?
i figured out your test .
crowns , presents , punishments , favorites .
you &apos;re trying to show me the dangers of my own elitism .
my constant striving to be the best .
so i &apos;m requeathing this tiara .
because if i become the kind of person
who thinks it &apos;s their place to pick favorites
and torture the rest , i &apos;ll die sad and alone .
and that &apos;s what you were trying to teach me .
very good , annie .
you pass .
she &apos;s actually just my favorite .
so i thought the documentary format
would be like fish in a barrel ,
but as is the case with a real barrel of fish ,
after a while , it can become cramped ,
chaotic , and stinky .
fortunately , if in the end , your documentary is turning out
just as messy as real life ,
you can always wrap it up with a series
of random shots , which when cut together
under a generic voice @-@ over ,
suggest a profound thematic connection .
i &apos;m not knocking it .
it works .
guys .
jeff and i became ...
kind of like father and son today .
no , we did not .
troy , i am telling you , man ,
this salmon is really good .
would you mind passing me the pepper ?
* butterfly in the sky *
* i can go twice as high *
* take a look *
* it &apos;s in a book *
* the reading rainbow *
