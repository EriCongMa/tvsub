i &apos;m still not comfortable with this .
steve , everyone on this rock knows you and five @-@ o.
so if you guys show up ,
the clientele &apos;s gonna be out the back door
before you even step foot in the front ,
but they don &apos;t know me .
maybe we do a different location .
no , no , no .
this guy doesn &apos;t want anyone to know that he &apos;s in the casino ,
so it &apos;s the only place
where he &apos;s not gonna have security with him .
i &apos;ve surveilled it ; i know how to get in ,
i know how to get out . boom .
what if you get compromised ?
i &apos;ll improvise .
you &apos;re the one who told me to get back up on the horse , okay ?
and you were right .
so you &apos;re just gonna have to let me do this .
what , are you deputizing me ?
just in case , all right ?
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
i &apos;ve got this covered , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
six , pass line wins .
betting against the table hasn &apos;t been working for you , huh ?
maybe you can get lucky some other way .
haven &apos;t we met before , miss ?
what do you want ?
riku sato , where is he ?
who the hell are you ?
five @-@ o.
now where the hell is sato ?
hey , bro , any good sets out there ?
picking up .
if we &apos;re lucky , we &apos;ll get swell .
anything else , lover boy ?
nani , you reading over my shoulder ?
only the dirty parts .
more coffee ?
just the check , please .
oh , it &apos;s already taken care of .
gentleman at the counter .
thanks , nani .
sure .
what &apos;s that for ?
well , captain grover ,
let &apos;s just say i &apos;ve been around long enough to know that
when someone pays for your meal they usually want something .
come on .
are you really that cynical ?
where i &apos;m from , cops do that for each other .
besides , i figured it was the least i could do
after pointing a shotgun in your face .
yeah , well , that hostage crisis was rough on everyone .
i think it &apos;s fair to say that there was fault on both sides .
lieutenant ,
i realize the governor gives you guys a free pass ,
but to be honest ,
that behavior i saw out there in the field the other day ,
that &apos;s a surefire way to get yourself alienated
from your brothers in blue .
i mean , i &apos;d hate to see you in a situation
where you call for backup and it doesn &apos;t show .
i think you need to be having this conversation with mcgarrett .
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not having this conversation with mcgarrett .
mcgarrett &apos;s not a real cop .
he doesn &apos;t think like a cop ,
he doesn &apos;t act like a cop .
you , on the other hand ...
i did my homework ; you &apos;re a good cop .
got your badge back after going through a rough patch .
i know what that &apos;s like .
have a nice day , captain .
i &apos;m coming
i said i &apos;m coming !
all right , all right .
mary , what ...
you should see your face .
what are you doing here ?
who &apos;s baby is this ?
mine .
no , it &apos;s not .
she &apos;s mine .
i adopted her .
what are you talking about ?
how could it be yours ?
it &apos;s been in the works for a while ,
but i kept in on the dl
in case a certain someone was gonna be critical about it .
i don &apos;t believe it .
isn &apos;t she cute ?
i named her after dad .
oh , you named her john ?
no , joan .
mary , i don &apos;t want to be critical ,
but you have difficulty managing your own life .
how you gonna look after the baby ?
i think i took care of a 90 @-@ year @-@ old man pretty well .
for three weeks , and he died .
he died of natural causes , okay ?
okay .
you got to give her back , mary .
steve , i can &apos;t return her like she &apos;s an xbox .
she &apos;s not an xbox .
she &apos;s a little baby person , okay ,
and this is a responsibility you &apos;re gonna have
for the rest of your life .
you &apos;re really killing my buzz being a new mom .
thanks .
yeah ? okay .
i &apos;m on the way .
i got to go . all right , listen ,
we &apos;ll talk about this when i get back .
bye .
buddy , listen to me , the way i see it ,
mary didn &apos;t adopt a kid ; you did .
all right , &apos; cause it &apos;s only a matter of time
before that poor , unfortunate child
is looking for some suckling at 3 : 00 a.m. ,
is gonna be looking to you .
no , there &apos;s gonna be no suckling ,
no ?
&apos;cause that baby is going back .
oh , you &apos;re gonna send it back , what , to the orphanage ?
with a bunch of other kids that nobody wants ?
what ?
yeah , no , it &apos;s a good idea .
i mean , it &apos;s probably a better idea
than leaving it with your sister .
wait a minute , i thought you didn &apos;t approve ?
i don &apos;t approve .
okay , whose side are you on then ?
i &apos;m on the side where the kid has a chance of being loved .
if you think mary is capable of doing that ,
then i &apos;m all for it , okay ?
gentlemen , what we have here is a male victim .
c.o.d. is quite evident based on the multiple stab wounds .
he was most likely attacked in the water .
maybe a couple of guys got territorial over this break ,
and then it got out of hand .
a reasonable theory , but highly unlikely .
the victim &apos;s hands are noticeably free of defensive wounds ,
which suggests that the attack was sudden and unexpected .
okay , do we get an id ?
i was just getting to that .
just spoke to a lifeguard who patrols this area .
he said our vic &apos;s a regular ,
here every monday 9 : 00 a.m. , swell or no swell .
okay , so predictable schedule ,
he &apos;s hit up close and personal ,
no defensive wounds .
our victim could &apos;ve been attacked by somebody who knew him .
our victim has been identified as bryan carpenter .
pinches for assault , drug charges , grand larceny ,
guy &apos;s been in and out of trouble for years .
looks like his troubles followed him out to sea .
got signs of a break @-@ in .
place has been tossed .
clear .
i wonder if they found what they were looking for .
what is that ?
something under this drain .
this could be what they were looking for .
there &apos;s something else in there .
oh , my god .
chin , what is it ?
our victim wasn &apos;t bryan carpenter .
his name is matt hutchins .
he was a cadet at the police academy
when i was teaching a class
on executing search warrants a few years ago .
normally , i don &apos;t remember students ,
but matt asked a lot of really smart questions .
one day , he cornered me after class
and asked me what the job was really like .
the kid wanted to make a difference ,
but wasn &apos;t even sure it was possible .
he grew up in a rough neighborhood ,
drug dealing , gangs .
when i asked him , &quot; why be a cop ? &quot;
he said that &quot; the game &quot; was the only thing he knew ,
and that he would end up on one side of it or the other .
he wanted to take the right path .
so he became a cop .
well , matt never got his badge .
he was busted for heroin possession .
he got kicked out of the academy .
i was disappointed .
special agent blake kennedy , atf .
i just got a call ?
what happened to my guy ?
sorry . your guy ?
matt , uh , hutchins was working
a long @-@ term undercover op for atf .
i was his handler .
so he was never kicked out of the academy .
kicked out ? hell no . that was all part of his cover .
what was the op ?
we had him infiltrate a gang of gunrunners .
a network with ties to asia and the mainland .
matt &apos;s job was to id the players
and record transactions ,
and we were just about to drop the net on these guys .
another few weeks and matt would &apos;ve a career bust .
if you guys were that close ,
we have to assume one thing ...
matt &apos;s cover was compromised .
how ?
he was attacked this morning .
we believe he was deliberately targeted .
where ?
baby makapu &apos;u beach .
we were just there today .
a witness told us that he surfed there every monday .
my son and i go there every monday .
well , he couldn &apos;t break cover ,
but i &apos;m sure that was his way of keeping an eye on you .
do you know who did this ?
we believe it had something to do with his undercover assignment .
those people he was investigating , he hated them .
how often did you two speak ?
every few weeks .
a text here , a quick phone call there .
always from a different number .
but the last time ,
his tone was different ...
how so ?
i don &apos;t know .
he sounded happy .
so i was under the impression that
maybe it was coming to an end and ...
he &apos;d be home soon .
my husband sacrificed everything for that job .
lieutenant , you need to find the bastards who did this .
this is the guy we &apos;re after , j.c. dekker .
he spent his wayward youth on the north shore
making a name for himself in the ice trade .
now , ten years ago , he moved his operation into town
and he upgraded his clientele ,
focusing primarily on weapons distribution .
guys right below him have been there since the first dollar .
everyone else has been recruited along the way .
looks like matt worked his way up the chain of command .
well , like i said : that was matt &apos;s talent .
he was able to talk the talk ,
and that earned him respect .
and when it came time ,
he wasn &apos;t afraid to use some muscle .
when i first sent him in ,
we didn &apos;t know what to expect .
we thought it was a six @-@ month op at most .
but matt &apos;s intel was so good ,
we soon realized we were sitting on a major case .
right , now that matt &apos;s gone ,
so are the chances of taking these guys out .
that &apos;s why i like dekker for this .
motive , means , opportunity .
what about these guys ? what happened to them ?
kia .
as tight as dekker &apos;s operation is , he has his problems .
in the last few months ,
these dirtbags have been robbed a number of times
by a three @-@ man crew we have yet to identify .
how were these robberies going down ?
it wasn &apos;t any street @-@ level , crime @-@ of @-@ opportunity stuff .
i mean , we &apos;re talking well @-@ coordinated hit @-@ and @-@ runs .
cash drops , they were there .
guns in storage , they were there .
all right , well , maybe dekker thought matt was selling &apos; em out .
giving information to the guys who were ripping off his boys .
or maybe dekker figured out matt was a cop .
i mean , either way ,
dekker had at least two motives to kill this kid .
we &apos;re gonna need everything on this case .
yeah .
linda , can you come over here for a moment ?
linda davies ,
this is steve mcgarrett ,
detective danny williams .
hi .
they &apos;re with five @-@ o.
now , linda transcribed all of matt &apos;s reports .
she &apos;ll get you everything you need .
of course . right this way .
this is everything .
ms. davies , do you mind if we ask you
how well did you know matt ?
we actually never met .
i &apos;ve listened to his voice for the past four years .
i transcribed every one of his reports .
so i could tell when he was having a good week
and when , when it was bad .
how did he sound in his last few reports ?
anything unusual ? did he mention any threats ?
if you &apos;re asking me if his cover was blown ,
i can tell you this :
the longer you leave an undercover out there ,
they get tired and depressed , sloppy .
they start making mistakes .
it &apos;s not my place to say this , but i , i really think
we had enough to take these guys down months ago .
what makes you say that ?
i &apos;ve been working this job for a while now ,
and i &apos;ve seen this department take people down for much less .
if we would have done what we normally do ,
i @-@ i just can &apos;t help but wonder
if matt would still be alive .
all right , are you gonna say it or am i ?
i &apos;m not saying anything .
i &apos;m not ready to start pointing fingers .
okay , i &apos;ll say it .
if the atf could have made an arrest months ago ,
why didn &apos;t they ?
keeping matt out there past his sell @-@ by date
could have compromised his cover .
dismantling an operation like this ,
it is not as easy as it sounds .
think about matt , all right ?
this guy , maybe he , uh , maybe he got tired ,
maybe he missed his family , maybe somewhere he slipped up .
maybe he slipped up ,
and maybe kennedy kept matt out there too long
because he cared more about making his case
than he did about looking after his boy .
maybe , but like i said ,
i am not ready for pointing fingers
until we have something that is real , okay ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s real :
j.c. dekker . and let me tell you something else .
if he suspected for one second
that matt was a cop , he would take care of business .
i agree .
but to go rattle that cage right now is a terrible idea
because we could blow the atf &apos;s entire three @-@ year operation .
so we &apos;ll tread lightly .
got your attention now or what ? !
hey , hey , hey , what happened to &quot; tread lightly , &quot; huh ?
i &apos;m giving you three seconds to get your hands off my throat .
or what ?
how &apos;s your girlfriend look in black ?
sit .
now listen to me very carefully :
you &apos;re done mouthing off .
i &apos;m gonna ask the questions from now on .
you &apos;re just gonna nod yes or no .
bryan carpenter , do you know him ?
that &apos;s not technically a yes or a no .
i &apos;m gonna take it as a yes .
i &apos;m also gonna assume that you did this .
what happened ?
this morning , where were you ?
complying with the state &apos;s unconstitutional invasion
of my physical sovereignty .
come again ?
i was peeing in a cup for my p.o.
you can ask him .
okay , well , that still doesn &apos;t mean you didn &apos;t order the hit .
why would i do that ? bryan was my friend .
let &apos;s assume that you &apos;re telling the truth again for two seconds .
why would somebody want to kill him ?
i have no idea .
and why do you care about one of mines anyway ?
shouldn &apos;t you be celebrating
at a donut shop or something right now ?
that sounds excellent .
get up .
now here &apos;s your itinerary for the next couple of days :
nothing .
you don &apos;t move from here , you understand ?
hpd &apos;s gonna sit on your place
until we straighten this out .
if i hear that you leave ,
even to take your library books back ,
detective williams and i , we &apos;re gonna come back
and we &apos;re not gonna be as courteous next time .
well , that was very subtle .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s calling whoever killed matt right now
and telling &apos; em to lay low .
what are you talking ? he didn &apos;t order the hit .
did you see the look on his face ?
he didn &apos;t know anything .
okay , well , if that &apos;s the case ,
then we have to consider
the possibility that matt was dirty , okay ?
dirty .
yes , dirty , okay ?
if he was selling information to the crew
that ripped off dekker and he slipped off somewhere ,
it would &apos;ve gotten him killed .
danny , matt was a cop .
i know he was a cop , okay ?
i knew plenty of guys back in new jersey
that were undercover for so long ,
they ended up slipping ;
they didn &apos;t know what the line was .
just @-@ just wait . just wait .
yes , mary ?
wait-- what ? !
and so it begins .
salmonella ?
really ?
i shouldn &apos;t have eaten that egg salad on the plane .
yeah .
mary , this is exactly what we were talking about before .
steve , bad eggs have nothing to do
with my parenting skills , okay ?
i could be a good mother ,
just not right now .
i really need you to watch joan for me
&apos;cause i have to stay here overnight .
no ! no , no , no ! i can &apos;t do that .
steve , you have to .
mary , no , mary ...
i don &apos;t have anybody else to call !
i have to stay here over ... - mary .
i &apos;m in the middle , i &apos;m in the middle
of a homicide investigation .
okay .
i &apos;ll just call child protective services .
and joan will have to be placed
with a foster care family for a while .
i just hope that the trauma doesn &apos;t
affect her cognitive development .
cognitive ? you don &apos;t even know what that word means .
you &apos;re a horrible uncle ,
you know that ?
this funny to you ?
yeah !
so when you &apos;re through amusing yourself ,
i need you to wipe down and change her pad , please .
not at all . i &apos;m retired , you see .
and it &apos;s gonna be way too entertaining
to see uncle steve on diaper duty . so go ahead .
hey , why is there a baby attached to your chest ?
oh , uh , mary .
ah . say no more . mazel tov .
thanks .
anyway , i was able to track down
the manufacturer of the key we found at matt &apos;s house .
oh , good .
it traces back to a set of locks
that they sold to honolulu zoo .
oh , let me see that .
actually , you know what ? here , just for a second .
what ?
ok ? careful .
yeah , yeah .
okay , danny , let &apos;s go .
wait .
if she gets hungry ,
bottle in here . you got it ? let &apos;s go .
wait-- how am i supposed to know if she &apos;s hungry ?
oh , you &apos;ll know . trust me , you &apos;ll know .
sato ?
i don &apos;t know any sato .
you know for somebody who likes to gamble ,
you don &apos;t have a very good poker face .
your name is hideaki kuroda .
you &apos;re sato &apos;s moneyman .
you have a wife .
you have two children .
rosie and kin .
now , rosie , she &apos;s very talented at the piano .
and kin , well , he aced math ,
but he needs a science tutor . right ?
oh , and you just brought , um ,
a brand @-@ new sports car .
for your mistress .
so far , so good ?
i also know
that you want out of sato &apos;s crew .
but you can &apos;t because you &apos;ve been gambling
with your boss &apos; money .
and you &apos;ve been losing .
trying to cover it up ,
moving the money around from place to place .
but that hole ?
yeah , that hole just keeps getting deeper .
and deeper .
now if i know this ,
then really it &apos;s only a matter of time
before sato figures it out .
and when he realizes that he can &apos;t get his money back
because you lost it
at blackjack and craps , and roulette and horses ,
he is gonna hurt you in the worst way that he can .
now , we can help you ,
mr. kuroda , but you first you got to tell me
where i can find sato .
what business do you have with sato ?
i don &apos;t give a damn about sato .
i just want to ask him
where i can find adam noshimuri .
there it is . there are the lockers .
b @-@ 24 .
you still think matt &apos;s not dirty ?
okay . we got over a $ 100,000 cash .
explain to me how is it that
an undercover cop has this kind of money ?
i can &apos;t .
okay ? i can &apos;t .
but that doesn &apos;t make him dirty .
steve , he had the key to that locker
hidden in a shower drain .
he did not want anyone
to see this cash-- why ?
maybe he was getting paid
for inside information by the guys
that were ripping off dekker .
that &apos;s a big maybe for a guy who put his wife
and his son &apos;s lives on the backburner
for three years to take dekker down .
don &apos;t mind the smell .
ooh ! yeah , i know .
strained peas .
only partially digested .
here , could you , uh ... ?
hey , hi .
thanks .
did you , uh , get anything
besides baby puke ?
yeah . funny .
i ran the credit histories on matt and his wife .
nothing unusual-- they live paycheck to paycheck
just like most honest hard @-@ working civil servants on the island .
can we focus over here ?
yeah , you ran the finances , no surprises .
good , what else we got ?
i dumped matt &apos;s phone .
the only thing of note
was a series of phone calls
to a local real estate agent all in the last week .
name of cherie tranton .
real estate agent ?
that seem strange to you ?
maybe the lease is up on , uh , on his place .
ah , yeah , or maybe he was looking to buy some property
and launder some of this cash .
i &apos;ll check in with agent kennedy .
see if he knows anything about the money
or the real estate agent .
you know what , chin ? hold off on that for now .
let &apos;s take a look at matt &apos;s field reports first .
i want to keep atf out of the loop for now .
well , kennedy had all the same intel matt did . you know ?
oh , i see .
so i &apos;m crazy , my @-@ my theory is nuts
thinking that matt went bad ,
but your new amazing idea
is matt &apos;s handler was the one
giving information to the guys that ripped off dekker .
well , i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s possible , okay ?
we all heard what kennedy &apos;s transcriber said .
kennedy could &apos;ve pulled matt out
and taken the case down weeks ago .
that would explain why kennedy kept matt
out in the field so long .
right .
so let &apos;s just take a closer look at the transcripts .
see if we &apos;re missing anything . all right ?
what are we doing ?
it &apos;s your turn .
my turn for what ?
we &apos;re a team .
danny , everybody &apos;s got to put in 110 % .
look at this-- that &apos;s 110 % right there .
chin and i , we &apos;re gonna go talk to dekker
see if he can shed some light on this cash .
in the meantime , while you &apos;re on babysitting duty ,
run background on this real estate agent .
see if there &apos;s any connection
between dekker &apos;s crew and cherie tranton .
and try not to let her drool on the evidence .
we &apos;re gonna need it .
smart kid . uh , i got an idea .
uh , why don &apos;t i step up for the team and ,
uh , chin and i will go out .
you stay here , make those calls , and deal with , uh ,
your soiled niece here ?
change her soon .
you understand ? or she gets a rash .
oh , does she ?
diaper bag &apos;s in steve &apos;s office .
bottles are in the fridge .
you &apos;re gonna need that .
why was this in a storage locker
belonging to your dead friend ?
let me guess .
there &apos;s a hundred grand in there .
how did you know that ?
&apos;cause i gave it to him .
bryan asked me for a loan .
said he &apos;d get it back to me by the weekend .
wait a minute-- a guy asks you
for a hundred thousand dollars and you just give it to him ?
yeah , i trust my friends .
what he want the money for ?
i don &apos;t ask for details , man .
what i don &apos;t know won &apos;t put me in a box .
now if you &apos;re done harassing me ,
i &apos;m gonna get some fish tacos with my police escort .
if matt didn &apos;t steal that money ...
yeah , it throws some cold water
on the theory that he was dirty . hey , dekker ?
i &apos;m done talking
until i get my money back .
oh , you mean this donation
to the widows and orphans fund ?
that &apos;s very generous of you .
now , listen , why don &apos;t you tell me about this crew
that &apos;s been ripping you off-- who are they ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
those guys that have been hitting you
are probably the guys that killed your friend .
well , then i sincerely hope you catch them .
okay , listen to me .
i know you &apos;ve been taking some big financial hits lately .
okay ? so i want to do you a favor .
i &apos;m going to extend our police presence .
you and everybody in your life
is gonna be protected by hpd 24 @-@ seven .
just to make sure you feel safe .
we &apos;re gonna have eyes on you day and night .
yeah , good luck in the import and export biz .
enjoy your tacos .
wait .
i got something that might help .
this is an in @-@ house surveillance video
from a local gang getting ripped off by another crew .
what &apos;s in the crates ?
guns , drugs and other party favors .
i &apos;m more interested in the guys behind the masks .
is there any way we can id these guys , charlie ?
there &apos;s always a way .
i &apos;ll call you when i got something .
all right , thanks , buddy .
hey , charlie ?
it &apos;s good to have you back .
once upon a time there was a very handsome prince .
and this , uh , handsome prince
had a very beautiful black stallion .
and this black stallion was , uh , was admired
by everybody in the kingdom .
he was the fastest and fairest stallion in the land ,
about 528 horsepower , very nice stallion , anyway .
uh , one day , uh ,
this incredibly handsome prince ...
yeah , he was , he was out of sight , let me tell you .
he was partnered up with a mean ogre .
a disgusting , hairy ogre .
it was not a match made in heaven .
they would slay dragons together from time to time .
and they &apos;d argue all the time and , of course ,
the brilliant charming prince would @-@ would win those arguments
because the ogre was a dope .
despite their , uh , victories ,
there was a dark cloud that loomed .
because ...
the dopey ogre coveted
the handsome prince &apos;s stallion , okay ?
and he was a very greedy , selfish ogre
with @-@ with major control issues .
and he would never
let the handsome prince ride his own stallion .
hold on , we &apos;re gonna pick this up in a second .
oh good , it &apos;s the real estate agent .
hello .
yes , yes it is .
uh , that &apos;s perfect .
i can , uh , i can meet you there .
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s the address ?
that was fast .
making up for lost time . check it out .
i got a clean screen capture on one of your guys .
we can estimate height ,
weight , shoe size .
if we run those traits through the hpd arrest database ?
we &apos;re gonna get dozens of matches
and then lots of possible suspects .
but ...
if we measure pupillary distance ,
which in this case is 63.2 millimeters ,
and we combine it with all of the other traits ,
it narrows the field considerably .
aloha , joey tillman .
okay , what do we got ? robbery , guns ,
assault , more robbery . this has to be our guy .
you know , swat &apos;s on its way .
maybe i don &apos;t need to ask this ,
but should we wait ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
cover !
looks like we got three shooters .
these guy move weapons for a living .
they &apos;re gonna be armed to the teeth .
we &apos;re gonna need more guns .
you should &apos;ve waited for swat .
you really want to do this now ?
hold fire !
this is hpd swat !
drop your weapons and come out .
you are outnumbered .
this is your one warning .
that &apos;s tillman .
move it .
clear !
clear !
hey , yo .
you &apos;ll want to come take a look at this .
same crates we saw in the surveillance videos .
these have got to be the guys that &apos;ve been ripping off dekker .
all right , let &apos;s get an alert out right away .
i thought you said there were three shooters .
there were . third guy must &apos;ve slipped out the back .
oh , he slipped out the back .
well , that &apos;s exemplary work , commander .
steve .
take a look at this .
entry wound &apos;s in the back of the head .
we didn &apos;t kill these guys .
the third shooter did .
oh , you mean the guy that escaped on your watch ?
on my watch ?
you were standing right next to me when this went down .
see , it wouldn &apos;t have gone down
if you just waited a little bit
and let swat do its job .
but , hey , like i said ,
exemplary work , commander .
so why does he shoot his own guys ?
well , maybe he &apos;s tying up loose ends .
which could be the same motive for killing matt .
maybe this third shooter knew
that matt was getting close to the crew .
we need to work out what matt wanted that money for .
all new construction ,
brand @-@ new carpeting ,
engineered quartz countertops .
and there &apos;s a great school district
for your little girl , when she &apos;s ready .
oh , no , that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s very nice .
she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s actually
a friend of mine &apos;s . i &apos;m just babysitting .
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m single .
oh , my . well ...
so refreshing to meet somebody who &apos;s so ... giving .
you must be a very warm person .
and you &apos;re so fit .
oh , thank you very much .
i just appreciate a man who can wear a pair of pants .
okay . well ... now , this condo &apos;s got a great layout .
although ... there &apos;s only one bedroom .
wink .
look at that . she said &quot; wink , wink , &quot;
and then she winked .
so tell me ...
huh ?
... what winds of fortune
have blown your little ship into my harbor ?
oh , um ... matt hutchins ,
actually recommended you .
mr. hutchins !
oh , did he rent the apartment for you ?
yes , he did .
i have to say ,
this was a first for me .
i mean , i have people who come and want to window shop ,
but i &apos;ve never had someone want to rent a condo for just one day .
well , uh , yeah , one day .
that &apos;s all we need it for .
today &apos;s that day , so here we are .
tomorrow , silly .
tomorrow , yes , of course .
tomorrow &apos;s that day , that &apos;s what i meant .
you know , for $ 1,000,
you boys must have something scintillating planned ,
so you better keep cherie &apos;s number in your phone .
homeowner &apos;s association doesn &apos;t like little side deals like this ,
so it &apos;s our little secret , okay ?
all right . cherie , you &apos;re very naughty .
honey ... you have no idea .
you are gonna love this view .
wow , very nice .
hey , steve .
something you gotta see . come down here .
it seems like matt was running surveillance
on the lockers where we found the money .
you know what , if you &apos;re gonna hold the baby in the sun , okay ,
just ask me and i &apos;ll put a sunhat on her .
you know what , though ? the question is ,
why would he be doing surveillance on the lockers ?
okay , matt recorded all the times and dates
of dekker &apos;s weapons transactions . right ?
the crew that was ripping dekker off had all that information .
are you thinking that matt thought
that someone in the atf leaked it ?
i think he was building a case .
i mean , he could have borrowed the money off of dekker ,
planted it in the lockers
to set up whoever was leaking that information .
if that were the case ,
he would have planted the misinformation in one of his reports .
now look at this .
here &apos;s an entry about the money drop at honolulu zoo .
set to be dropped off at 9 : 00 a.m. ,
picked up at 11 : 00 a.m. tomorrow .
all right , that &apos;s a two hour window for the money to be stolen .
yep , we were right .
matt was setting someone up at the atf .
kennedy .
he could have been selling information to tillman
about dekker &apos;s operation .
that &apos;s why he kept the case open and matt undercover for so long .
he was onto a good thing ,
he didn &apos;t want it to end .
well , he keeps his hands clean , and he gets a cut of the profits .
and then when he found out that matt was on to him ,
kennedy got one of tillman &apos;s guys to kill him .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to finish what matt started .
you want to come ?
let &apos;s do it .
all right , so listen up .
grab whoever picks up this money the second they open the locker .
i want this entire place locked down .
i want men on every exit ,
and i want two men every 30 yards around the perimeter .
let &apos;s go .
i wouldn &apos;t have done it this way .
yeah , you don &apos;t say ?
mcgarrett , we should wait .
let your suspect exit the zoo , then you take him down .
that way , we don &apos;t get into a firefight
in the middle of all these civilians .
i want to secure the perimeter .
okay ? he &apos;s not going to escape this time .
he wouldn &apos;t have escaped last time
if you &apos;d have just waited for swat .
i could &apos;ve been dead if i waited for swat .
maybe . but there &apos;s a right way and a wrong way to do things .
you don &apos;t like me . all right ? i get that .
but i &apos;m in command and control of this operation .
i &apos;m also the team leader , okay ?
so you and your team ,
you can come aboard with us or you can stand down .
whatever you say , uh ...
commander .
nothing .
did you remember to give joan her bottle ?
of course i did .
you &apos;re texting max right now , aren &apos;t you ?
no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re a terrible liar .
whoa , whoa , whoa . i got something .
black hoodie , straight ahead .
moving fast , heading straight for the lockers .
hold it right there .
took you long enough .
traffic .
don &apos;t move a muscle .
why ?
take a look around , linda .
look at where you are .
you see this room ?
you don &apos;t get to this room by accident .
it &apos;s over .
we know you were feeding matt &apos;s intel
to your boyfriend here .
and we know that with that information ,
he and two of his associates
were able to systematically rip off dekker &apos;s crew .
yesterday , this guy right here ,
he put two bullets in the back of their heads
to make sure they kept quiet .
now , who &apos;s to say
he wouldn &apos;t have done the same thing to you
after you collected that money ?
matt trusted us .
no , we were his lifeline .
and y @-@ you betrayed him .
for what ? money ?
no .
we just didn &apos;t want to go to jail .
shut up , linda !
you make me understand .
why &apos;d you have to kill him ?
matt called a few weeks ago .
he wanted to know who had access to his transcripts .
he suspected that his reports had been compromised .
it was only a matter of time until he traced that back to us .
i &apos;m ... sorry .
i &apos;m ...
so sorry .
you done here ?
now i am .
maybe i should &apos;ve ... pulled matt out .
you know , if i @-@ i &apos;d just pushed the button sooner ...
what say we go push it now ?
what the hell is this ?
there was nothing incriminating on that tape i gave you .
where &apos;s my money ?
where &apos;s your money ?
good news is , we got your money and your guns .
bad news is , we got your money and your guns .
allison , there &apos;s something you need to see .
爸爸
hey , matty .
you know , i often dream about the kind of man you &apos;ll become ...
your strength and courage , your sense of right and wrong .
there are so many things
a father wants to teach his son ,
and sometimes you gotta teach by example .
in accepting this assignment ,
i hope i &apos;ve helped make this world the kind of place
you deserve to grow up in .
son , there &apos;s always hard choices in life ,
sacrifices that need to be made .
i just want you to know daddy made this one
out of the love i have for you and your mother .
