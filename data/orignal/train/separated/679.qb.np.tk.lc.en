第二季 第七集
daniel is on a digging mission
about my father investing in nolcorp .
we play this right ,
we guarantee you the seat behind your father &apos;s desk .
conrad grayson , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of gordon murphy .
the victim is the same man
in victoria grayson &apos;s kidnapping case .
can we count on your service ?
what did you promise them ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll know until it &apos;s too late .
will you marry me ?
yes !
emily thorne ...
allenwood ...
amanda clarke .
penance is a sacrifice .
a voluntary punishment to show remorse for a sin .
the more grievous the sin ,
the greater the self @-@ inflicted suffering .
for some ...
the ultimate penance is death .
but for others ...
it is simply a means to an end .
mason .
come on in .
ahh . the david clarke house .
now was it coincidence , serendipity ,
or strategy that brought you here ?
location .
you &apos;re up early ... for a writer .
who can sleep when there are so many irksome questions ?
take the intime nature
of your friendship with amanda clarke for example .
you are on antipodal ends of the social strata , after all .
i don &apos;t choose my friends based on their net worth .
then by what criteria ?
a shared history , perhaps ?
as much as we both enjoy
the sound of your voice , mason ,
why don &apos;t you just get to the point ?
you know , it &apos;s amazing what you can find
when you know what you &apos;re looking for .
an allenwood photo .
i &apos;ve never denied my time in juvie .
mm @-@ hmm , and yet , you pretend
to have only met amanda clarke last year ,
which leads me to conclude that your paramour
and your former cell mate are one and the same .
you think that amanda and i were lovers ?
how else to explain your living in her childhood home ,
bankrolling her exorbitant crusade ?
perhaps you should try your hand at fiction .
either talk to me now , or you can read all about it
when i hit number one on the &quot; times &quot; best @-@ seller list ... again .
american will devour the salacious tale
of the felonious sapphic blondes
and their vendetta against
one of the wealthiest families on the planet .
mm , to say nothing of the epic libel suit that will follow .
not if i write the truth .
then do .
and we won &apos;t have a problem .
kara !
sorry . i seem to keep scaring you .
it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;ve all had good reason to be on edge lately .
with everything being the way it is ,
i think it &apos;s best if i go .
i @-@ i booked a flight for this afternoon .
it &apos;s embarrassing ,
but i @-@ i need a credit card number to confirm it .
i have cash .
nonsense . please let me take care of it for you .
you &apos;re too kind .
it &apos;s a nice spot for a romantic breakfast .
or is this strictly business ?
i have some intel for you .
business it is .
there you are .
thank you .
enjoy your meal .
you have 24 hours to position daniel
to take over grayson global .
in 24 hours , conrad will be arraigned on murder charges ,
which will make daniel &apos;s power grab
that much easier to construct .
the prosecutors are gonna drop the case .
you seem very sure of that ,
considering the lengths you went to to frame him .
conrad &apos;s not my end game .
the investors &apos; lunch at grayson manor &apos;s still a go ,
which leads me to believe
the initiative is sending an envoy .
how &apos;s that ?
they didn &apos;t get conrad out of jail for nothing .
you should be there .
okay . well ... what about your mother ?
won &apos;t she be there , too ?
she booked a flight to colorado springs this morning .
you &apos;re okay with that ?
the sooner she gets out from under that roof ,
the better for everyone .
i am genuinely sorry
for how things turned out with her .
i know you wanted more .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
finally got him to quiet down .
who &apos;s narciso rodriguez ?
he made carolyn bessette &apos;s dress
when she married john @-@ john kennedy .
oh . that narciso rodriguez .
when i was 10 , my , um ,
foster mom collected magazines
with their wedding on the cover ,
and i was practically obsessed with it .
i wanted , um ...
my wedding to be like theirs someday .
it &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s not stupid .
money &apos;s tight , i know .
i &apos;m not 10 anymore .
it &apos;s fine .
&quot; mason treadwell &quot; ?
what do you want , mason ?
to invite you for lunch chez moi .
i just had the most intriguing chat
with little carl &apos;s godmother .
cliffs notes version--
i know about your little jailhouse connection ,
and i &apos;d like to give you a chance
to tell your side of the tale .
that &apos;s , uh , fantastic .
sounds like a &quot; yes . &quot;
i &apos;ll text you the address .
big kiss to baby carl .
what is that about ?
mason , um ...
wants to give me a journal
my father gave him to research his book .
are you sure that you want to open up all these old wounds ?
one last time .
i promise .
conrad , last time i found you here
was four years ago after the market crash .
it &apos;s my little spot at the end of the world .
you contemplating wading out to sea
and never coming back ?
hell , no . why go to the trouble of killing myself
when there are so many others lining up to do it for me ?
conrad ,
you &apos;re worth far more to these fiends alive .
as long as i nurture and hide their assets within my company , yes .
by the way , i &apos;ve been informed
that they &apos;re sending an attache
to the investor luncheon
to deliver my marching orders .
the initiative is coming to our home ?
yes , and once they cross the threshold ,
they &apos;re free to stay forever ,
just like the undead .
i will be damned if i let those people
write the final word on us .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re planning
to go toe @-@ to @-@ toe with the initiative .
why not ?
you and i are already doomed .
let them think we &apos;re laying down ,
and when the time comes ,
i say we drag them to hell with us .
emily .
what &apos;d you say to mason treadwell ?
as little as possible .
he figured out that we were at allenwood together .
i know , and now he &apos;s invited me over for lunch .
where &apos;s your gun ?
amanda , calm down . my plan is working .
yeah ? how would i know ?
you never tell me anything , and whatever it is you &apos;re doing ,
it &apos;s taking too long .
we need to shut him up for good .
amanda , one more day , and i promise ,
everything is gonna be fine .
sorry .
as of last night , you &apos;re no longer calling the shots .
what are you talking about ?
jack proposed , and i said yes .
for once in my messed up life ,
i have a chance at a real family .
i &apos;ve come too far
to let treadwell steal that away from me now .
if you go through with what you &apos;re thinking of doing ,
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna destroy your new family ,
not mason treadwell .
now give me your phone .
cancel lunch .
tell him that you &apos;re getting a restraining order .
you &apos;ve reached mason treadwell ,
bon vivant and provocateur .
leave your bon mots at the tone .
mason . amanda .
forget about lunch ,
and if i ever as much as hear your name again ,
i will ... get a restraining order .
perfect .
now go home to jack and the baby
and be grateful for what you have .
i hear you bought yourself a bar .
hey , little brother .
bought into . i &apos;m just the co @-@ owner .
for now , right ?
there &apos;s good money in getting people drunk .
even better money in these five boat slips we now co @-@ own .
well , unfortunately ,
they &apos;re in long @-@ term leases with some longshoremen .
well , leases are made to be broken .
don &apos;t forget what you &apos;re doing here .
that &apos;s the thing , it turns out the kids on the mortgage--
they &apos;re good guys .
well , the same can &apos;t be said about their old man
and the rest of the businesses along these docks .
i really gotta remind you ?
old man is dead .
that &apos;s a damn shame .
need any help with that ?
jack , hey .
meet my brother nate .
hey .
jack &apos;s my partner in the bar .
jack porter .
congratulations , porter .
kenny here-- he &apos;s got the midas touch .
pretty soon , your place will be turning profits
you can &apos;t imagine .
so the complete guest list is on this ...
why ? am i missing something ?
oh , kara . you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah . tell your folks i said thanks .
listen , before you go ,
i &apos;ve got a question i &apos;ve been wanting to ask you .
i don &apos;t mean to sound insensitive ,
but , uh ...
you were still married to david clarke
when he went to work for my father , right ?
yes .
i tried to convince him not to move us to new york .
things may have worked out differently .
he--he keep any records of any personal investments
he might have made a @-@ after he joined the company ...
maybe from a joint account ?
the man was deceiving the whole world .
if he wanted to hide something , he knew how to do it .
daniel , kara , i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt .
i wanted to leave this at your parents &apos; wedding
before ...
the whole thing went to hell ?
mom and dad will be very touched ,
assuming it &apos;s not ticking .
i see the police didn &apos;t hold your father for long .
i can &apos;t imagine the charges will stick .
yeah . can &apos;t keep a good man down .
i &apos;m gonna be late for my flight .
amanda didn &apos;t tell me that you were leaving .
no , i &apos;ve never done well with good @-@ byes .
have i missed a bon @-@ voyage party ?
oh , i was just heading out .
i didn &apos;t want to bother you again .
oh , well , i &apos;ll take you to your car .
hello , emily .
victoria ...
for you .
oh , a wedding gift .
how thoughtful .
would you please take this upstairs
and put it with the rest of the unopened gifts ?
i hope to see you again , kara .
i know amanda will feel the same way .
that woman &apos;s had it pretty rough .
whole family has .
yeah .
take care , daniel .
what , it wasn &apos;t , uh , enough
to pilfer my only friend ?
now you want my office , too ?
on the contrary .
i &apos;d say emily belongs to you .
hence , why i &apos;m here .
okay .
i &apos;m mostly ears .
emily and i have a plan in motion
to infiltrate grayson global
and to draw out the initiative .
the plan hinges on conrad &apos;s ouster
and daniel &apos;s ascension to power .
but first , to gain legitimacy ,
daniel must prove that they own
a majority stake of nolcorp .
what makes you think i would fork over
my life &apos;s work to the axis of evil , hmm ?
because this might be our last chance to save emily .
emily drew funds from a buried account .
she &apos;s been cashed out of nolcorp since i went public in 2006 .
well , that &apos;s nothing that a team of forensic accountants
wouldn &apos;t uncover if they started to dig deep enough .
and trust me , once grayson &apos;s team starts digging ,
they won &apos;t stop until he gets what he &apos;s after ,
which means emily &apos;s fate rests with you .
you &apos;re asking for proof of david clarke &apos;s
original investment ?
and here it is .
on record ,
i am only doing this for emily
because her father asked me to keep her safe .
but what i want to know is ...
why are you doing this ?
what is she to you ... exactly ?
she &apos;s someone who i once hurt very badly .
and now i &apos;m trying to make it up to her .
well ...
hurt her again ,
and i swear , you will pay .
understood .
aiden , where the hell are you ?
on my way to you with david clarke &apos;s original check
to nolan ross for nolcorp &apos;s start @-@ up funds .
are you serious ?
i thought the government seized all his financials .
only the ones that they could find .
the players are lined up , danny .
time to strike .
are you in ?
i &apos;m in .
in for what , daniel ? what &apos;s happening ?
we &apos;re taking over the company .
now listen , i &apos;m gonna need you to keep my father occupied
while i assemble the power players this afternoon .
no problem ,
but are you sure you can trust aiden ?
he &apos;s given me no reason not to .
just keep my dad in the spotlight
after his speech and away from the library .
if i can persuade our key investors to back me ,
i &apos;m gonna call for a vote of no confidence
on my father next week .
daniel , a word ?
don &apos;t mind me .
i couldn &apos;t help overhearing you ask kara
about david clarke &apos;s investments .
couldn &apos;t you ?
last spring , you were so vehement
against my testifying for the government .
i &apos;d have thought that plane crash
would &apos;ve put all that intrigue behind you .
what &apos;s the sudden re @-@ interest ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
why did you invite his wife to stay with us ?
must have been awkward for her , sleeping in the same house
with the home wrecker who bore his child .
don &apos;t be smart .
you &apos;re going to have to start focusing on
how you &apos;re going to proceed if your father stands trial .
and how do you plan to proceed ?
will you be standing by your man ,
or was that vow as fake as the rest ?
that &apos;s entirely my business .
now understand something , daniel .
i have always been and will continue to be
your strongest advocate .
&apos;so don &apos;t keep secrets .
you &apos;ll only live to regret them .
so now you &apos;re stalking me ?
not to mention breaking and entering .
through an unlocked door ?
whatever . i meant what i said about a restraining order .
well , i &apos;m not here to see you , my dear .
i &apos;m here waiting for your betrothed .
i thought he might like to include this
in the family scrapbook .
it &apos;s not what you think , mason .
and i &apos;ll tell you the whole truth ,
but you have to promise to help me .
help you ? of course .
i &apos;ll do whatever i can . what is it ?
not here .
i have to protect jack and the baby .
protect them from what ?
none of it was my idea .
i never even wanted to go along with it .
emily masterminded the whole thing .
but why should emily thorne
care about vindicating your father ?
because she &apos;s obsessed with me .
has been ever since the first day at allenwood .
used me in her sick game .
used you to what ?
please . we can &apos;t do this here .
i &apos;ll follow you to your place .
emily would destroy us both
if she knew i was talking to you .
rest assured , amanda ...
she never will .
tell me a little bit more
about your friend aiden mathis .
i &apos;ve known him for years .
he &apos;s another one of takeda &apos;s proteges .
well , you might have mentioned that .
&quot; hey , nolan ...
&quot; this one time at revenge camp , i met this fellow avenger ,
&quot; and , oh ,
guess where he &apos;s going to be summering . &quot;
what did he want ?
oh ... just the original check
from your father &apos;s investment in nolcorp .
don &apos;t .
it &apos;s too late .
nolan , your company , everything that you &apos;ve worked for--
means nothing
if it could potentially hurt
the , uh , only real family i &apos;ve ever had .
helen .
welcome to my home .
conrad , you &apos;re looking well .
we &apos;re all sending good thoughts your way
regarding the arraignment tomorrow .
oh , i do appreciate that .
helen crowley , my wife victoria .
helen is one of our largest shareholders .
pleasure .
for me as well .
i &apos;ve heard so many things .
excuse me .
we &apos;ll speak privately before i go ,
and i am looking forward to meeting
your recent houseguest .
she &apos;s one of them , isn &apos;t she ?
in the flesh .
our future .
收款人 罗斯 · 诺兰
i &apos;ll get mr. grayson ready for his speech .
the guy cleans up well .
so ...
how serious was it ...
between you two ?
i &apos;m not gonna talk to you about aiden , nolan .
oh . let &apos;s talk about your mom .
are you really ready to let her disappear again
after everything that we went through to find her ?
it &apos;s safer for her this way .
she used victoria &apos;s credit card
to book a flight to colorado springs .
and ... you know this how ?
i &apos;ve been tracking her online transactions .
when everything settles down ,
i should know where to find her .
jack .
hi . i ...
hear congratulations are in order .
yeah . yeah , usually you have the wedding
before the baby , but ...
congratulations ?
well , sometimes it &apos;s best when things just happen .
i &apos;m sure you two will be very happy .
us three .
thanks , emily . uh , listen ...
i have a weird question . do you--
do you happen to have mason treadwell &apos;s phone number ?
amanda went over to his place earlier for lunch ,
but she should be back by now to take over baby duty .
i gotta get behind the bar .
no , i don &apos;t ,
but if i hear from her , i &apos;ll let her know you called .
all right . thank you .
okay . bye .
jack and amanda are getting married ?
ems , ems , that is huge .
i hope you didn &apos;t make plans this afternoon ,
because i &apos;m gonna need you .
seems like old times .
so this is it .
all your research .
every word ,
every image , every syllable of my investigation .
amanda , i want you to know
that i deeply regret the role i played
in your father &apos;s demise .
this next book will not only clear his name ,
but also portray you as a victim of your stalker--
ms. emily thorne , the sociopathic socialite .
it &apos;s a relief to finally tell someone .
you have no idea .
oh , confession , they say
is good for the soul ...
and for book sales .
now , uh , getting back to your days
working at that descriptively named gentleman &apos;s club ,
i couldn &apos;t help noticing that
your last spin on the dance pole
coincided with the murder of frank stevens .
now my theory is that emily alerted you to the danger ,
then had someone dispatch him ?
she &apos;s unhinged .
you have no idea what she might do
when her back &apos;s up against the wall .
including bashing in a man &apos;s skull ?
she &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
amanda , no !
give it to me !
go home . he knows everything .
don &apos;t you see ? we don &apos;t have a choice .
choose your family .
you &apos;re making a huge mistake .
so i was right .
you really are the brains in this machiavellian scheme .
you were this close , mason .
but you missed the one thing
that &apos;s been right under your nose the whole time .
she &apos;s not amanda clarke .
you are .
after my father was arrested ,
you were the only person i could trust .
i believed you when you said
that you &apos;d write the real story .
you had the power to change my future ... and my father &apos;s .
and words can &apos;t express my regrets .
no . words , mason , are exactly the weapon that you chose .
everything that i have become ...
and everything that i &apos;ve given up
is because of what they did to my father ...
and what you failed to do for him .
if i could redress the balance ...
just in time .
you close ?
is who close ?
oh , i &apos;m on my way ,
but i &apos;ve got some bad news , i think .
guess who just ditched her flight at j.f.k.
and just rented a car on victoria &apos;s credit card .
your mother &apos;s gone rogue .
damn it .
do you want me to stay here or stick to the plan ?
stick to the plan .
time to start making amends , mason .
who is this ?
kara , it &apos;s mason treadwell .
i have urgent information about the murder of gordon murphy .
how &apos;d you get this number ?
your husband gave it to me .
i &apos;ll meet you at bel @-@ aire cove in 30 minutes .
i would like to express my gratitude for your
unwavering support through these incredibly challenging times .
listen , a man in my position
can &apos;t help but generate powerful enemies ,
which is the only sound explanation
for the outrageous accusations constantly hurled my way .
so get used to it , because in the coming months
when the dust settles ,
i assure you , the only thing making headlines
will be the alchemy behind your rising portfolios .
now victoria and i are honored to have you at our home ,
and i look forward to allaying any concerns you may have .
thank you very much .
conrad , you promised a q &amp; a.
yes , of course .
perfect .
how did you know gordon ?
such an enigma of a man .
could anyone really know gordon murphy ?
cut to the chase , mason .
show her the pocket watch .
this came into my possession from a police friend .
however misunderstood he was ,
clearly you and gordon shared a deep connection .
if you intend to honor his memory ,
you must go as far away from here
and these ... people as possible .
that is what he wanted for you , is it not ?
yes .
then you must go , kara .
but before you do , there is one more thing
that you need to know about your first love .
david clarke didn &apos;t lie to you .
he was a victim as well .
mason , what the hell are you doing ?
penance . isn &apos;t this what you wanted ?
what ? i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t understand .
20 years ago , a book i wrote about your first husband
depicted him as a calculating villain
when in fact , he was an innocent man ...
mason , stop . she &apos;s not ready to hear this .
whose only crime was to run afoul of some very powerful ,
very malignant people .
mason , she &apos;s off her medication . she &apos;s unstable .
the graysons .
yes . they paid me to perpetuate their lies .
mason , stop her .
wait ! my story isn &apos;t finished .
leave a message .
aiden , my mother &apos;s on her way back to the graysons &apos; ,
and she &apos;s out for blood .
keep your eyes open .
damn it .
as our most important clients ,
i know that many of you , if not all ,
are planning to pull your investment in grayson global tomorrow .
but i know something the rest of the world does not .
our firm is actually undervalued by as much as 50 % .
as i &apos;ve recently discovered ,
grayson global has an indisputable multibillion @-@ dollar stake
in nolcorp software and electronics ,
a fact my father has either been couching
or oblivious to for the past 20 years .
if you &apos;ll consider me as a replacement to my father as c.e.o. ,
i will guarantee this company &apos;s solvency ,
and under my leadership , we will move on nolcorp
and triple our net worth inside a year .
the choice is yours .
how do you plan to run your company from prison ?
i assure you , that won &apos;t be necessary .
look , even if there is a trial ,
i &apos;m prepared to appoint an interim leadership
to navigate the day @-@ to @-@ day until i &apos;m acquitted . so ...
this is a disaster .
where the hell is everyone ? where &apos;s my son ?
i have no idea--
mr. grayson .
yes .
mrs. grayson needs to speak with you in her suite .
it &apos;s urgent .
excuse me .
conrad , i have bad news .
oh , yes .
that does seem to be going around .
shut the door .
kara , whatever demons you &apos;re struggling with ,
we can get you the best help possible .
the only demons i &apos;m struggling with
are standing right in front of me .
i want a confession .
you can start by telling me what you did to david .
you were never in love with him , were you ?
oh , no . she was . she was very much . i mean , too much .
i want to hear it ...
kara .
from her .
victoria had nothing to do with what happened to david .
it was all me .
conrad ...
no , no , no , it &apos;s all me .
look , i made a deal with some nefarious people
who had every intention of framing me
for that plane going down .
so you blamed it on david ?
the man was stealing my wife .
yeah , i wanted him to feel the same level of pain
that he &apos;d inflicted on me .
come on . you of all people should understand that .
and--and i &apos;m sorry to say
that your david was a very trusting man ,
which made the thing ...
it was almost child &apos;s play .
looking for this ?
get in the dressing room .
both of you .
gentlemen , make yourselves at home .
we have a warrant , mr. treadwell .
we need to speak with you about the murder of gordon murphy
as well as the conspiracy to frame conrad grayson .
conspiracy indeed .
detective gunther ?
why the hell haven &apos;t you been answering your phone ?
is she there ?
yeah .
she standing 10 feet away from me .
her name &apos;s helen crowley . emily ,
we &apos;ve just made contact with the initiative .
i &apos;m talking about my mother .
she never got on that plane . she &apos;s coming for the graysons .
you have to stop her .
bloody hell . well , where is she ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t find her or victoria and conrad .
wait .
a half a dozen cameras have been disabled .
she &apos;s got them in victoria &apos;s bedroom .
second floor , end of the hall .
switch the rest of them off .
aiden ...
trust me .
put these on .
make no mistake , kara .
after david &apos;s arrest , there was no relief .
and after his conviction , there was only guilt .
what , so you want me to believe
that it would be too merciful to kill you ?
there are far more insidious forces at work here .
shut up !
the people who blew up flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7--
they killed david .
to be more specific , gordon did .
liar .
it &apos;s true . there &apos;s proof--
a torn picture of david on the day he died .
i saw the photograph . it proves nothing .
well , then you didn &apos;t see both halves .
look in the lining of my jewelry box .
turn around .
gordon .
he murdered david , kara .
no , no . no , no .
he couldn &apos;t .
he did . and so much more . he was one of them .
he was the worst of them .
shut up !
kneel down !
the blindfolds !
put them on . put them on now .
i &apos;m sorry , victoria .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re safe .
what , you--you grabbed me ?
no .
agent mathis did .
how are you involved ?
i &apos;m afraid i brought her into this .
i snuck you off the estate down the beach path ,
and , uh , ms. thorne was there .
he showed me his badge .
i checked with the bureau . he &apos;s legitimate .
these pills--
they were , um , found on your husband ,
but there was no trace of medication in his system ,
so , um , they &apos;re yours , aren &apos;t they ?
you don &apos;t have to be ashamed .
there are people who can help you .
and unfortunately ,
the people that gordon worked for
have you in their crosshairs .
whatever plans you had for the graysons
would likely end up getting you killed if you had stayed .
my only plan for the graysons
was to scare them into telling me the truth .
there &apos;s , um ...
there &apos;s a car , a full tank of gas ,
and some money to get you started .
you &apos;re not taking me in ?
not if you promise never to return .
it &apos;s the only way to save yourself
and ... your daughter .
best of luck .
i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
well , just ... keep yourself safe .
kara , is there ...
anything that you want me to tell amanda ?
just tell her i wish i could &apos;ve been a better mother .
* hey , my little girl child *
* out in the winter *
* out in the wild *
i can ...
i can stay if--if you want . it &apos;s not a problem .
no , you go .
i have one more loose end to tie up .
okay .
i &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve got workman &apos;s comp , right ?
padma .
you okay ?
i figured i &apos;d kick off my shoes ,
get comfy , stab myself on your rug .
did you break a glass ?
something wrong ?
would you still want me
if i wasn &apos;t nolan ross ?
because tomorrow ,
he may cease to exist as you know him .
conditions change , but you can &apos;t .
mm . i don &apos;t know .
i hate feet , and look at me now .
i am .
and ...
no matter what happens ,
i &apos;ll always see you as nolan algernon ross .
my middle name &apos;s mitchell .
i gave it a shot .
i told you ,
i &apos;m not going to answer a single question
until i speak to my lawyer .
no lawyer &apos;s gonna help you now , mason .
well , well , well ...
if isn &apos;t benedict clarke ,
you must be proud of yourself--
lulling me into complacency only to double @-@ cross me .
i &apos;m almost flattered the police think me capable
of such a byzantine scheme to bring down a government plane ,
murder my accomplice ,
then frame an innocent tycoon for the crime .
i assume you &apos;re here to gloat .
i &apos;m here to make a deal .
the next time detective gunther walks in that door ,
you &apos;re going to waive your right to an attorney .
you will go to prison for crimes you didn &apos;t commit ,
including downing that plane , just like my father did .
only difference is ,
you &apos;re going to give a full confession
so that we can avoid a trial .
that &apos;s some deal .
i think i &apos;ll pass .
well , if you do ...
the police will soon uncover
a staggering amount of evidence against you ,
right down to my mother &apos;s testimony ...
about how you were in league with gordon murphy .
i recorded the whole thing .
my answer is still no .
if there &apos;s a trial , i have a fighting chance .
at the very least , i &apos;ll be able to expose you
and your treachery .
you &apos;re forgetting , mason ,
that i &apos;m in possession of the only thing
that could one day exonerate you ...
a full confession of my own .
if you cooperate , i will set you free
when i deem the time to be right .
which could be eons .
or just enough time for you to write my entire story ,
from the night my father was arrested
to the day my vengeance is complete .
this is the book ...
that we both know you were destined to write .
poetic justice or my true legacy ?
or perhaps a touch of both ?
and the world will finally meet
the real leo mason treadwell .
i guess you &apos;ve got a deal ,
ms. clarke .
to properly do penance ,
one must express contrition for one &apos;s sins ...
and perform acts to repair the damage
caused by those transgressions .
i &apos;ve been thinking about our wedding ...
the one you imagined as a kid .
so have i.
i don &apos;t want a fancy wedding , jack .
all i need is you ...
and little carl
and a few friends
on the boat you named after me .
so i just spoke to our so @-@ called security detail ,
and the cameras went black for about five minutes today ,
during which kara clarke murphy vanished .
the initiative .
you &apos;d think they would &apos;ve simply let her kill us .
i don &apos;t think the word &quot; simply &quot; is even in their vocabulary .
and as you so astutely pointed out ,
our value to them is in our ability to serve ,
for the moment .
conrad , there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
it &apos;s about daniel--
whatever it is , it can wait until morning .
a morning i truly believed
we would never see .
please sleep well , sweetheart .
i &apos;ll be right outside your door .
it is only when those acts are complete
that the slate can truly be wiped clean ...
and amnesty gives way to a new beginning .
i ...
just thought i &apos;d come check on you .
it &apos;s been a rough day .
you all right ?
you keep asking me that .
