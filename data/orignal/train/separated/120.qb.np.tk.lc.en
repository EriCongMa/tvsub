第六季 第十九集
you faked metadata , and diane presented it in court
to get cary released , yes ?
but diane didn &apos;t know it was faked .
yeah .
you &apos;re caught . you faked the metadata .
if i were you , i &apos;d come clean .
又一起福瑞克丑闻
accusations are being leveled tonight
against illinois first lady
and state &apos;s attorney @-@ elect alicia florrick .
charges of possible election fraud have been leveled ,
having to do with voting machines in river north .
many voters complained on election day
about their touchscreen votes ,
believing that votes for frank prady
ended up as registered for alicia florrick .
this was blamed on a calibration error .
touchscreen technology over time
often suffers from calibration drift ,
a loss of accuracy of
where exactly the finger of the voter presses .
the revelation comes on the heels of the release
of numerous sexually @-@ charged e @-@ mails
between the state &apos;s attorney @-@ elect
and her former boss .
mrs. florrick , in an interview yesterday ,
characterized the e @-@ mails as nothing more
than an office fantasy .
it was a flirtation .
an innocent one but a wrong one .
i was having difficulties with my husband at that point ,
and i got carried away .
but many have seemed to turn
against the once @-@ admired first lady .
i &apos;m disappointed in her , obviously .
look , i didn &apos;t ,
but i don &apos;t like how she pretended to be so ...
well , this is a press witch hunt .
they like building people up so they can knock them down .
now it &apos;s alicia &apos;s turn .
i love my wife , obviously , and i trust her implicitly .
there was nothing between my wife ...
... distant reaches ...
... pizza famous for their ...
mom ?
you okay ?
yeah .
i was just watching ...
um ... sharks .
is it too loud ?
no , you should go to bed .
i will .
are you gonna get eaten ?
hell , yeah .
no one has filmed sharks here , from in the ...
what is that ?
it &apos;s a microchip .
okay .
are you planning to build a robot or something , ken ?
no , i just thought that you should know ...
i &apos;m giving you a warning , eli .
we &apos;re gonna investigate .
investigate what ?
the election , mrs. florrick .
come on , ken , this is bogus .
she &apos;s getting some bad press ,
and now you &apos;re going after her ?
this microchip was found in a touchscreen voting machine
in the 12th precinct .
it &apos;s called a &quot; man in the middle &quot; hack .
that means , someone inserts a device that ...
well , i don &apos;t know what it means ,
but people smarter than me know what it means ,
and this thing was programmed
to override votes in the 12th precinct .
how &apos;d you find it ?
a precinct captain saw a screw loose
on the side of one of the machines .
he opens it , found this connected to the wiring .
come on .
how do you know he didn &apos;t plant it ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s why the election board has to investigate .
you wearing a wire , ken ?
go to hell , eli .
that &apos;s the last time i do you a favor .
we did not hack any voting machines .
good , then you &apos;ll be cleared .
okay , okay , it &apos;s not the end of the world .
stop burning a hole in the carpet , dad ,
and we might believe you .
what we have to do is to stave off a recount .
alicia , are you listening ?
marissa , do you mind getting us some coffee ?
how long do you need ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s a falafel truck downstairs .
just the coffee . thanks .
florrick , agos &amp; lockhart .
are we in trouble , eli ?
no .
we haven &apos;t done anything wrong ?
no , we did not .
someone else may have done something wrong ?
just tell me , eli .
that &apos;s the thing-- i don &apos;t know .
the problem is my supporters ?
one of them may have hacked these machines ?
yes .
bishop ?
or redmayne .
he likes to guarantee success .
so we welcome a recount .
i mean , if i lose , i lose .
no , no , it &apos;s not that simple .
elections are stolen during recounts .
there are too many hands involved , too many lawsuits .
these votes shouldn &apos;t be count and these votes should .
and the press is moving against you .
that &apos;s always a bad sign .
okay , so ...
what do we do ?
how &apos;s your friendship with prady ?
you want me to talk to him ?
your opponent has to push for a recount .
tell him he doesn &apos;t want to win that way .
not ugly .
it doesn &apos;t end , does it ?
you win the electi , you think it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s never over .
i wish i could tell you that you &apos;re wrong ,
but you &apos;re right .
life ...
... sucks .
thank you .
yes ?
so , did you do it ?
do what ?
screw your boss .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s any of your business .
you don &apos;t get to decide when it &apos;s my business .
you must be mr. parillo .
i must be .
is mr. prady coming ?
no .
did something come up ?
yeah , i did .
i don &apos;t think i understand .
i think you do .
you wanted to convince frank not to ask for a recount .
it &apos;s against his better interests , right ?
but you &apos;re not dealing with him anymore ,
you &apos;re dealing with me now .
and i &apos;m not so easily tricked .
okay , have mr. prady call me if he wants .
you will lose , ma &apos;am .
because i &apos;m gonna prove to the election panel
that you stole this election .
go ahead and walk away ,
but you can &apos;t walk away from the election board .
thanks for the time , diane .
actually , i &apos;m just about to finish my report ,
and i needed one final comment from you .
of course , but i &apos;m not sure what i can add at this point .
gerald giraffe feels happy .
h @-@ a @-@ p @-@ p @-@ y. happy .
hey , um , can you , can you just
hold off on that for just a minute ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not sure either ,
but , um , it &apos;s come to my attention
that there &apos;s a problem with the metadata
that you submitted as evidence in court .
what kind of a problem ?
sad ...
gerald giraffe feels sad .
the metadata indicates that detective prima deleted
the e @-@ mail from the canadian authorities ,
but he couldn &apos;t have .
he was testifying on the stand at the time .
okay ...
so , um , then i thought it was maybe geneva pine ,
but actually she was out of town at a prosecutors convention .
hey , dora , you &apos;re about to spill juice on the couch .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. wiley , what are you trying to say ?
um , i &apos;m saying from what i could ascertain ,
detective prima never deleted the e @-@ mail .
uh , no one did .
which means that somebody altered the metadata
after the fact to make it look like he did .
i &apos;m saying you submitted false evidence , diane .
angry .
gerald giraffe feels angry .
i &apos;ll need you to leave now , mr. wiley .
if you have anything to say , i &apos;m closing my report .
i need you to leave , mr. wiley .
let &apos;s go , kids .
come on .
come on , guys .
come on .
come on , timmy .
let &apos;s go .
did you fake evidence ?
what ?
the metadata that i submitted in court .
the evidence that said detective prima deleted that e @-@ mail .
did you alter it ?
diane , let &apos;s ...
in here .
i never intended for you to use it , diane .
i never gave it to you , because i found another way
to save cary , but by the time i got to court ,
you &apos;d already found it on my computer .
wiley knows .
he &apos;s taking it to the police board .
i know , that &apos;s why she came to me .
and not to me ? !
i told her she couldn &apos;t ,
because it would put you in a worse spot .
so you just hoped it would pass ?
no , no , i wanted ...
kalinda , i need you to not say anything .
you &apos;ll both be questioned as to what was said here .
now , diane , kalinda intends to come clean about what she did ,
but we were trying to find a way not to ...
not to hurt you .
this is a disbarrable offense for me .
i know .
... to take long . i &apos;ve got ...
then tell him he &apos;s done .
tell him it &apos;s over .
whats it , diane ?
we submitted false evidence in cary &apos;s criminal case .
what ?
the metadata showing that
detective prima deleted his e @-@ mail , it was faked .
kalinda hacked into the cpd &apos;s server ...
wait , what ? stop , diane .
she did what ?
no , don &apos;t answer that .
none of us have attorney @-@ client privilege with you on this ,
so every word you say puts us all in jeopardy .
the firm &apos;s already in jeopardy .
the evidence was faked ?
cary , stop it .
this is about the internal affairs investigation into prima , right ?
yes .
then you have to go before the police review board .
you and kalinda admit the error .
and clear prima ?
if this is true , he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
they tried to frame me with an altered interrogation tape .
i agree with david .
we open up our books and admit to everything .
it &apos;s the only way we can nip this in the bud .
it might be the only way you don &apos;t end up in jail .
madam state &apos;s attorney , the pride of the democratic party .
congratulations !
oh , thank you , mr. landau .
oh , that &apos;s great .
and you must be ...
marissa .
alicia &apos;s executive assistant .
so very nice to meet you .
well , come on in !
have a seat , have some popcorn ,
the official snack food of the state of illinois .
i didn &apos;t know we had an official snack food .
we do !
general assembly voted on it back in 2003 .
it was between popcorn and potato chips .
so , i know why you &apos;re here .
this silly investigation .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t think it is so silly , mr. landau .
well , don &apos;t worry .
you won &apos;t have any trouble with the election board .
believe me , we are putting
all our talents behind you , mrs. florrick .
well , i &apos;m flattered , but ...
this evidence , this @-@ this hacking device ...
it is a problem .
in other words ...
she doesn &apos;t want comforting words , frank .
she is a woman of action .
we must earn her faith .
i assume you all know spencer randolph .
oh , my god , it &apos;s you .
it is truly an honor ... sir .
thank you .
spencer has volunteered
to represent you before the election board .
elections need to be over !
at some point , they need to be done .
don &apos;t you agree , ma &apos;am ?
yes , i do .
oh , you mean alicia .
yes , i agree .
good . i voted for you , alicia .
and even if i didn &apos;t , i would volunteer to represent you
because i am tired of living in a corrupt cook county .
an election result that is constantly questioned and revised
is an election result that i can &apos;t trust ,
and that is why i am here to help ,
if you will let me .
thank you , mr. randolph . please .
&quot; will , i need you .
&quot; i need you on top of me . &quot;
&quot; alicia , meet me after work ,
at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; will , sometimes , i worry this is wrong ,
&quot; you being my boss . &quot;
&quot; i know .
&quot; but i can &apos;t get you out of my head .
&quot; the touch of you , the taste !
&quot; i need you tonight . &quot;
&quot; isn &apos;t that a song ?
&quot; &apos; need you tonight . &apos; &quot; lol .
&quot; god , i &apos;m horny . &quot;
&quot; you were away at depos this week ,
&quot; and all i could think about was your hands on me .
&quot; sometimes this feels too dangerous . &quot;
&quot; will , i had a crazy dream
&quot; about you last night .
&quot; details later . happy face . &quot;
&quot; alicia , last night was amazing .
&quot; you leave me exhausted .
&quot; i slept like a baby . dot , dot , dot . &quot;
look , cary , i was worried about you .
you were going to prison , and ... and it wasn &apos;t right .
that &apos;s why i did it .
make me your lawyer , kalinda .
let me fight this for you .
no , cary . i ...
finn &apos;s doing it .
i &apos;ll do it better .
no , you won &apos;t .
you care . i ...
i need somebody who doesn &apos;t care .
they dismissed the charges
because of what you did for me , kalinda .
no .
yes .
cary , they knew prima
doctored the interrogation tape .
geneva was ready to drop the charge .
no , it was a combination of that and the deleted e @-@ mail .
the two got me released .
let me be your lawyer .
no .
but thanks , though .
i &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s true , ladies and gentlemen .
only one hacking device has been found
in a voting machine-- so far .
so you think there are more .
i think it &apos;s clear someone was trying to steal this election .
and to do that , they would have had
to hack a lot of other machines .
and what action , mr. parillo ,
are you asking the board to take ?
a canvass of all voting machines
in precincts where the reported results
differ by more than four points
from the predicted results .
four points is a questionable enough ...
deviation , given the margins of error
some of these polls ...
lean in , and i &apos;ll whisper something to you .
we &apos;re talking about thousands
of potentially disenfranchised voters .
now we should hug each other .
may i call my first witness , please ?
may i , please , panelists ?
oh , yes , yes , please .
let &apos;s start with this cluster right here .
two precincts in proviso ,
one in oak park and berwyn .
these are all close together physically ,
so the hackers could change the votes
from a centralized location .
now , all of this was consistently predicted
to go to prady by at least four points .
so , in each of those precincts ,
there was a seven @-@ point swing-- sometimes more--
from what the polls were showing ?
and i found a number of other areas ...
statistics are nonsense .
shiny nonsense ,
but nonsense nonetheless .
don &apos;t worry .
no , no and no .
so , would the number of votes
from these outlier precincts
have been enough to change who won the election ?
absolutely .
nothing further .
i tender the witness .
ah , well , thank you for tendering , sir .
this isn &apos;t a court of law ,
mr. parillo .
the usual formalities don &apos;t apply .
so ...
mr. zubrovsky ,
you know the old saying ,
politicians use statistics like drunks use lampposts--
more for support than illumination ?
that &apos;s very funny .
untutored but very funny .
well , yes and no , because sometimes
even the best pollsters get elections dead wrong ,
isn &apos;t that right ?
has it happened ? yes .
during the last presidential election--
one of the most heavily covered political events
in history-- they consistently had mitt romney
leading barack obama .
they did .
even to the last day of the election .
romney plus one--
that &apos;s what all their models said .
but the actual tally was ?
obama plus four .
their methodology was off ; mine wasn &apos;t .
that &apos;s right ,
you did get the prady / florrick race
almost perfect ,
but weren &apos;t there certain precincts that you
thought went to mrs. florrick but actually went to prady ?
i did not screen for those .
well , fortunately , we did .
and we found 14 precincts
where prady outperformed his expected total vote by ...
four points .
i want to marry him .
detective prima could not have deleted the e @-@ mail ,
nor could anyone else connected with the case have done so .
furthermore , certain discrepancies in the metadata
indicated a high probability that it was , in fact , altered .
falsified .
and did you determine
who had altered the metadata ?
definitively , no .
but all my evidence points
to it being someone connected with mr. agos &apos; law firm ,
as they were the ones submitting
the falsified evidence to the court .
i see .
the witness is excused .
actually , if i may ?
i &apos;m sorry , who are you ?
i &apos;m finn polmar .
i &apos;m here on behalf of kalinda sharma ,
of mr. agos &apos; law firm .
and i &apos;m here on behalf of diane lockhart ,
senior partner .
before this committee decides on this matter ,
we &apos;d like to be heard .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but you haven &apos;t been subpoenaed
or called by anyone connected with this case ...
yes , and i know how valuable your time must be .
we have information that will serve to clear detective prima .
what information ?
members of the board . i am diane lockhart ,
and this is kalinda sharma .
and , uh ,
yes , it is true .
i submitted false evidence to the court ,
for which i apologize to you
and to detective prima .
it &apos;s a little late now , isn &apos;t it ?
i , uh , i just want to be clear
that diane had no idea that the evidence was falsified .
it was entirely my doing .
i never intended to use it .
and in fact , we found another way ...
let &apos;s talk later .
we can &apos;t be seeing each other .
they faked that evidence against me .
what ?
kalinda . her law firm .
they framed me .
how do you know ?
they just admitted it to iad .
grace ?
is everything okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry you have to deal with all this stuff .
my stuff .
it &apos;s okay .
mom ?
yeah ?
was it just a flirtation ?
with will ?
no .
it wasn &apos;t .
so you lied ?
yes .
because ?
because it &apos;s none of their business .
that &apos;s okay ?
yes .
i have to go do my homework .
wait , grace .
give me a hug .
mrs. florrick , thank you for taking time out
to answer questions today .
you &apos;re welcome .
were you aware of any corruption in your campaign ?
no , not at all .
no involvement , directly or indirectly ,
in anything that could be construed as voter fraud ?
not even close .
i wouldn &apos;t stand for it , and it didn &apos;t happen .
thank you .
you &apos;ve been most understanding today .
do you want some popcorn ?
no , thank you .
mrs. florrick ,
on the morning of your election ,
i &apos;m fine .
do you remember a television interview
your husband did with mandy post ?
we did many interviews .
let me refresh your recollection .
in this one , your husband , our governor ,
said , and i quote ,
&quot; as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
&quot; you can take it to the bank , alicia florrick
&quot; is going to be the next state &apos;s attorney for cook county . &quot;
i appreciated his optimism .
i &apos;m sure ,
but shouldn &apos;t we be concerned about his certainty ?
he was being supportive .
or predictive .
he was reading
the same polls as everyone else .
but peter wasn &apos;t just reading the polls , was he ?
i think i answered that .
are you familiar with the help america vote act ?
vaguely .
let me fill you in .
it &apos;s a program where states get money
to buy and maintain voting machines ,
money that goes directly to each state &apos;s governor .
so peter had control over what machines were purchased ,
where they were stored , how they were maintained .
can you see my cause for concern ,
when your husband was in charge
of safeguarding the very voting machines
which wound up handing you this election ?
i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re asking me .
ladies and gentlemen , there are strong indications
that this election was undermined
by serious and systematic fraud ,
with help potentially from the highest levels .
but the only way we can find out for sure
is to conduct a full canvass
of all the machines in the suspect precincts .
can you excuse us ?
did you try to help me win the election ?
no .
did you try to help me win the election by cheating ?
are you serious ?
they brought up the help america vote act ,
said you were in control of the voting machines .
i don &apos;t control the voting machines .
i don &apos;t get anywhere near the voting machines .
i knew i had to stay clear of them ,
which is why i appointed an independent monitor .
now , if you want to know more ,
go talk to him .
who ?
ernie nolan .
what ?
he tried to bribe me before i ran .
well , that &apos;s not good .
it has nothing to do with me .
so you oversee the help america vote program for peter ,
but you &apos;re totally independent ?
if you &apos;re worried i threw the election to you , don &apos;t be .
good .
will you testify to that effect ?
no .
why not ?
when you were contemplating running , mrs. florrick ,
i offered to help you , but you weren &apos;t interested .
so why would i help you now ?
anyway , i found prady &apos;s men much more open to donations .
you donated to prady &apos;s campaign ?
yes .
you controlled the voting machines ,
and you gave to prady &apos;s campaign ?
no comment .
you put this hacking device in the machines for prady ?
but prady lost .
yes , because your campaign cheated better than his .
we didn &apos;t cheat .
well , good .
then this recount should put things right .
you should have taken my money .
&apos;cause now you won &apos;t be sa .
you are the chairman of help america vote , mr. nolan ?
yes , i am .
and you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines
in cook county ?
yes .
and did you find any more
of these hacking devices , these &quot; man in the middle &quot; devices ?
i did .
forty .
40 devices .
40 machines compromised .
even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each ,
that would be more than enough for mrs. florrick
to steal this election .
that is correct .
so you would advocate for a recount in those precincts ?
of course i would .
thank you , sir .
mr. nolan , in your meeting this morning with mrs. florrick ,
did you say that you wouldn &apos;t have swung the vote for her
because she turned down a bribe that you offered ?
excuse me ?
shall i repeat the question ?
no , i did not .
you didn &apos;t suggest
that if the recount is approved ,
the vote would swing to prady through your machinations ?
no .
you didn &apos;t say these words :
&quot; you should have taken my money .
now you won &apos;t be s.a. &quot; ?
i said no such thing . as a matter of fact ,
it was mrs. florrick who dragged me back to her office ,
where she hoped to pay me off so i &apos;d advise against a recount .
my goodness . is that true , mrs. florrick ?
did you really say that ?
uh , put her under oath .
then ask her .
this isn &apos;t a court of law , is it , mr. boxer ?
it is not .
well , let &apos;s have mrs. florrick take the stand .
let &apos;s hear what she has to say .
please .
good morning , mrs. state &apos;s attorney .
good morning , mr. randolph .
are mr. nolan &apos;s accusations against you true ?
no .
they are categorically false .
okay . can we all keep the comments to ourselves ?
but isn &apos;t this a classic he @-@ said @-@ she @-@ said , ma &apos;am ?
no .
why ? why is that ? why should this panel
take you at your word , mrs. florrick ?
because i recorded the meeting .
objection . your honor , this is beyond the pale .
well , perhaps mr. parillo can specify how this is beyond the pale .
it is a secret wiretap .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong , but a one @-@ person consent
has been held constitutional by the illinois supreme court .
people v. clark .
mr. parillo ?
thank you . so ...
do you have the recording with you ?
i do .
ah , how resourceful of you .
shall we hear it ?
when you were contemplating running , mrs. florrick ,
i offered to help you . but you weren &apos;t interested .
so why would i help you now ?
anyway , i found prady &apos;s men much more open to donations .
yes , i can understand why he doesn &apos;t want to hear it .
you donated to prady &apos;s campaign ?
yes .
you controlled the voting machines
and you gave to prady &apos;s campaign ?
gentlemen . ladies and gentlemen . no comment .
uh , i am as outraged by this as anyone .
this proves that the chairman of help america vote ,
the organization that maintains the voting machines , is corrupt .
there has to be a recount .
not if mrs. florrick is blameless .
blame isn &apos;t the issue . justice is .
the people deserve election results they can trust .
is there anything else ,
mr. randolph ?
alicia , i think we might have something for you .
i need a better picture , kalinda .
howell , i thought you said you were certain . are you or aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m certain . but i need a better picture .
look , the hacking device .
howell had a look at it .
uh , there &apos;s something odd .
the cary agos case .
there &apos;ve been more remakes of this case than spider @-@ man .
the case was dismissed based on fabricated evidence , your honor .
no , your honor , it was a case brought on trumped @-@ up charges .
at its best , your honor , this was an invidious effort
by ms. lockhart to undermine the credibility
of a decorated chicago police detective .
a detective who pressured a witness to testify against me .
at its worst , it &apos;s obstruction of justice ,
and i ask your leave to bring charges against ms. lockhart .
an unfounded charge on top of a trumped @-@ up charge .
the hypocrisy is really quite exquisite .
i &apos;m the arbiter of this exquisiteness , mr. polmar .
now , asa pine ,
ms. lockhart could be facing three years in prison .
so take me through it .
your honor , ms. lockhart submitted metadata
from the chicago police computer system ,
accusing detective prima of knowingly deleting an e @-@ mail
that pointed to cary agos &apos; innocence .
ms. lockhart had no way of knowing the metadata was amended .
not amended . faked .
it was quite simply , your honor , a mistake .
a mistake ms. lockhart herself would not tolerate from a paralegal .
objection , your honor .
your objection pales next to mine , mr. polmar .
if ms. pine &apos;s allegation is true , it is beyond inexcusable .
but ...
no . that &apos;s enough .
i will hear on these arguments tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 .
dear god , i need a drink .
okay , well , we &apos;re officially the bad guys .
not we . i am .
what do you want , ms. pine ?
want ?
you went after one lawyer and lost .
now you &apos;re going after another .
it &apos;s always a proxy for something .
so what do you want ?
mr. howell , hi .
hi .
there &apos;s no microphone , sir . you can just talk to me .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . uh , hi .
sir , did you have an opportunity to examine this microprocessor
taken from one of the 40 compromised voting machines ?
uh , i did . a photo of it .
th @-@ then over there , i examined it . when i got here .
and what were you able to ascertain ?
the technology &apos;s from 2012 .
and is there more recent technology available ?
oh , yeah . lots . this stuff is ancient .
things turn around twice a year now .
so in your expert opinion ,
was this hacking device used in this election ?
well , that &apos;d be dumb .
y @-@ you &apos;d update it . this is from 2012 .
mr. zubrovsky ,
have you examined the election results of the 2012 election ?
yes .
have you come to any conclusions ?
yes , there was a very large swing
in the predicted polling data from the 2012 election .
even larger than the recent race ?
yes .
now , you &apos;re speaking of the governor &apos;s race ?
yes .
peter florrick stealing an election .
objection .
i know we &apos;re not a court of law ,
but i &apos;ll still advise you , mr. randolph ,
not to speculate so wildly .
yes , sir .
you didn &apos;t tell me you were going after peter .
i &apos;m going after peter .
dad &apos;s not gonna be happy .
i &apos;ve consulted with the outgoing state &apos;s attorney .
oh . would that be state &apos;s attorney james castro ,
who wrongfully charged me ?
cary .
at my request ,
he &apos;s authorizing all charges against ms. lockhart be dropped .
thank you .
but the price will be high .
we wouldn &apos;t expect otherwise .
off the record ,
i can &apos;t condone castro &apos;s tactics in going after you , cary .
but the larger intent was sincere and more than justified .
six months ago , we offered cary a deal .
we would drop all charges
if he testified against lemond bishop .
diane , we will drop all charges against you
if you testify against lemond bishop .
and here we are , back again .
right at the beginning .
judge glatt was right .
it is like watching a remake of spider @-@ man .
except the evidence against you was tenuous .
the evidence here is ironclad .
there must be something else we can offer geneva .
well , i worked in that office ,
and bishop could cure cancer and wipe out world hunger ,
and they &apos;d still want him .
finn , could you give us a minute , please ?
yeah .
can &apos;t .
i know .
i spent six months looking overy shoulder .
you really want to go through life like that ?
&quot; did peter florrick steal an election ?
&quot; in battling charges of voter fraud ,
alicia florrick &apos;s lawyer
&quot; claimed the devices at issue dated from her husband &apos;s race
three years earlier . &quot; i didn &apos;t know .
that your lawyer was going to throw me under the bus to save you ?
he &apos;s not my lawyer ; the party gave him to me .
eli ?
sir , you do not micromanage spencer randolph .
eli , i can &apos;t have this .
it won &apos;t stick .
it &apos;s a dated charge , unprovable .
and your administration has been unimpeachable .
until randolph impeached it .
so you &apos;re saying i shouldn &apos;t have fought back ?
no . either we &apos;re a team , or we &apos;re not .
don &apos;t let him divide us .
mr. randolph , it &apos;s not that your efforts
on mrs. florrick &apos;s behalf aren &apos;t appreciated .
they are .
thank you , mr. gold .
now that you &apos;ve buttered me up ,
why don &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s on your mind ?
we need you to back down from the peter accusation .
back down ?
defending mrs. florrick by attacking her husband ,
there has to be a better way .
there &apos;s not .
i disagree .
is this your wish or your handler &apos;s ?
it &apos;s my wish .
that &apos;s too bad .
i &apos;m not here to defend you , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m here to defend the democratic process .
i &apos;m here to defend ...
... a hero .
we cast our eyes far and wide for them ,
but sometimes the most heroic people live amongst us .
heroes like alicia florrick .
a woman who watched her husband go to jail .
who stood by him until he was vindicated .
who worked her way up the legal ladder .
whose story of courage and commitment so affected
and inspired the people of cook county
that they chose to elect her to watch over all of them
as their champion .
but people smell blood in the water now .
party functionaries like mr. ernie nolan ,
who turned against her with outrageous lies
because he saw weakness .
but there is no weakness in alicia florrick .
there is only strength .
strength to fight for what she has earned .
and that is why i will not back down .
and i know that this panel will not back down either .
excuse me , mr. chairman .
i &apos;d like leave to recall a witness .
do you need more time , mr. howell ?
no . i &apos;m up to speed .
could you please tell us what you &apos;ve reviewed ?
yeah , um , this is a printout of the software specs on the hacking device .
and what can you tell us about the software ?
that it was remotely updated via wi @-@ fi connection
approximately two months ago .
just prior to the election for state &apos;s attorney .
it would appear so .
would you care to amend your earlier testimony
that the hacking devices have lain dormant since 2012 ?
yes . it appears i , uh ...
i @-@ i was mistaken .
given this testimony , the panel must approve recounts for
all 40 of the precincts where the hacking devices were found .
you &apos;re thinking of doing something , aren &apos;t you ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about geneva &apos;s offer .
i can see the wheels turning .
cary ... you turn evidence against bishop ,
he will kill you .
things aren &apos;t going well with the election board .
it &apos;s a momentary setback ,
but we &apos;re ready for a recount .
we can &apos;t have a recount .
we think it &apos;ll just make the count even tighter ,
but alicia will triumph .
mrs. florrick , i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re gonna have to ask you to step down .
what do you mean ?
we need you to withdraw .
mr. landau , i &apos;m not a cheater .
we know that .
what &apos;s going on , frank ?
alicia had nothing to do with the the hacking devices .
we know that .
but mrs. florrick wasn &apos;t the only name on the ballot .
there were other tough races . tilden &apos;s , for example .
who was in danger of losing his state senate seat .
oh , my god . if tilden lost his seat ,
we would have lost our supermajority in the state senate .
the republicans would &apos;ve been able to filibuster .
you see now why we need you to withdraw ?
no , i don &apos;t .
if the recount goes through ,
it draws attention to tilden &apos;s win .
so , the hacking device was for tilden ?
i can &apos;t comment on that .
i &apos;m not withdrawing .
i understand your position , mrs. florrick ,
but your sacrifice will not go unnoticed .
the party will make it up to you in the next round .
there is no next round .
in politics , there is always a next round .
a spot could come open on the gaming commission ...
i didn &apos;t enter this race
for a cushy spot on some stupid commission .
well , if the gaming commission doesn &apos;t interest you ,
take some time to think of a post that would better suit you .
and if i don &apos;t withdraw , what happens then ?
you don &apos;t want to do that .
why ?
because the party will destroy you .
or the party will hurt the governorship .
we all benefit from filibuster perv majority .
you know that , eli .
hal , can you come in here , please ?
i have another meeting ,
so , mrs. florrick , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
to stand and open your purse .
what ?
mrs. florrick has a way of recording her meetings .
are you frisking us ?
we &apos;ll hold on to your cell phone and get it back to you in 12 hours .
the party thanks you , mrs. florrick .
oh , my god .
did that just happen ?
landau &apos;s all bark and no bite .
he confiscated my phone .
i think we &apos;d be naive to assume it &apos;s just bluster .
no , i say you force the issue .
he threatened the governorship .
well , call his bluff .
you said that randolph was doing a fantastic job , right ?
he was .
well , then let him continue to fight the recount .
this is a man who &apos;s argued hundreds of cases ,
most of which have been probably a lot harder than this one .
the panel is gonna make a decision on the recount tomorrow .
do you believe in him ?
do you think he can turn it around ?
of course .
then get back in front of that panel
and let him win .
i will . thanks .
has kalinda approached you about giving up bishop ?
you know i &apos;m not at liberty ...
geneva .
you and i worked together .
please .
has she approached you ?
no .
okay , when she does ,
turn her down .
is diane gonna give me bishop ?
no , not diane .
me .
frank landau asked you to withdraw altogether .
well , that &apos;s a polite way of putting it .
well , is that what you want ?
no , i want to win .
okay .
let me handle it .
thank you .
may i have the floor ?
mr. randolph , the panel &apos;s ready to render a decision .
i believe that what i have to say
may have some bearing on your decision .
go ahead .
it has come to my attention
that an egregious fraud has been placed on these proceedings .
now , i have devoted my life to righting wrongs ,
to fighting corruption and collusion
and all manner of ills in the justice system .
and therefore i am compelled to speak out .
i have just discovered that alicia florrick
has been lying to me through these proceedings .
it is my understanding that the voting machines
were hacked under her direction .
this is a lie !
mrs. florrick ,
please have a seat . mr. randolph has the floor .
in light of all of this , i must not only side with mr. parillo ,
but i must encourage mrs. florrick
to step down in her role as state &apos;s attorney .
she has made a mockery of these proceedings .
she has committed the high crime of stealing an election .
she must never set foot in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
or any other political post , for that matter .
in my opinion , cook county
of the city of chicago deserve more .
i trusted you .
i put my fate in your hands .
the man whose speeches
i listened to and so admired ...
mrs. florrick , i assure you , this isn &apos;t personal .
like hell it isn &apos;t .
your problem can be summed up in three words :
two @-@ thirds majority .
be a good democrat , step down now .
the party &apos;ll take care of you .
everybody wins .
good day , mrs. florrick .
