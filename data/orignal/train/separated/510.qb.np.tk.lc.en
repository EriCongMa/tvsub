a place at the table
jess , i really appreciate you doing this last @-@ minute .
i thought when i committed to chaperoning the field trip ,
i would be able to take the day off .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m looking forward to it , actually .
the air and space museum is always fun .
with 24 fifth @-@ graders ?
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m good .
a little tired , maybe .
ok . i left you some cash in the kitchen ,
in case you guys want to get some pizza tonight .
ok .
just call me if anything comes up . ok ?
thanks again .
where are we on the multiple homicides ?
it &apos;s in bethesda at the home of frank and donna kingman .
she &apos;s the former donna stancroft ,
heiress to the stancroft electronics money .
we &apos;re setting up a live feed transmission from the crime scene .
sergeant carlson , can you hear me ?
sure can . how about on your end ?
loud and clear . why don &apos;t you walk us through it , sergeant .
ok , here we go .
when were the victims found ?
about an hour ago .
neighbor noticed the front door was left open ,
called the police .
nothing &apos;s been disturbed ?
no , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re seeing what the responding officers saw .
is that music i hear in the background ?
yeah . a phonograph in the study playing &quot; jingle bells &quot;
over and over .
sleigh bells in april ?
the unsub may have been trying to recreate
the atmosphere of a holiday meal .
it looks like their hands were bound .
they &apos;re bound , shot in the head execution style .
4 victims but 6 place settings .
maybe two of the intended victims were no @-@ shows .
or managed to escape ?
well , escape seems unlikely
given the highly organized nature of--
over there ! get him !
get the hell away from me !
police !
&quot; when one has not had a good father ,
one must create one . &quot;
friedrich nietzsche .
his name &apos;s ezra warren .
he &apos;s 23 years old , works as a waiter in d.c.
he &apos;s got a clean record .
so except for being covered in blood
at the scene of a mass murder ,
just your average joe .
the victims are donna kingman
and her two children jenna and lance
and donna &apos;s mother clara .
and what about the husband ?
frank kingman . police are searching for him now
and the oldest son dillon .
the other place settings were probably for them .
jenna , lance , and clara were all shot in the head ,
but donna was strangled .
yeah , her kill was personal .
she was likely the primary target .
i didn &apos;t do it . you have to believe me .
why were you in the house , ezra ?
it was supposed to be a birthday celebration .
whose birthday ?
lance &apos;s mom .
lance kingman , one of the victims ?
were you and lance friends ?
we were in love .
why didn &apos;t we just stay away like everyone wanted ?
who wanted you to stay away ?
lance &apos;s dad . he hated me .
because you &apos;re gay ?
yeah .
but , you know , lance said screw it .
it was his mom &apos;s birthday and we were gonna go
whether he liked it or not .
tell me what happened .
the 4 of them had just finished dinner .
lance and i show up , and immediately
lance and frank got into this massive fight .
you &apos;re not the one who decides who comes ...
as long as i &apos;m the man in this house , i won &apos;t ...
i &apos;m not one of your stupid workers .
please stop ...
i went upstairs to lance &apos;s room
to get away from them .
i was already pretty drunk , so i vaped some hash
and passed out .
please stop shouting .
please stop !
when did you wake up ?
i don &apos;t know .
it felt like the middle of the night .
so i go down the stairs and ...
i hear this creepy christmas music playing .
so i go into the dining room and ...
lance was dead .
they all were .
so your response was to run back
upstairs and hide in the bedroom .
i panicked . i saw police car lights outside and i panicked .
why did we have to go ?
why didn &apos;t we just stay away ?
why ?
there &apos;s no sign of robbery or forced entry .
dirty dishes in the sink .
they already had their birthday dinner .
4 dishes , 4 sets of silverware .
frank , donna , clara , and jenna .
but 5 wine glasses .
you &apos;re right .
so who joined them for a drink ?
i guess the killer wanted the victim to go through
a make @-@ believe dinner again before he shot them .
i don &apos;t think so .
look .
the splatter , it &apos;s on the tablecloth
but not the plates .
he shot them first and then set the table .
the ritual wasn &apos;t for the victims ,
it was for the unsub &apos;s own gratification .
obviously there was some sort of fight in here .
or someone wanting to make it look that way .
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s precision to the disarray .
in an actual fight , damage tends to follow
the path of the struggle , much like debris in a storm .
this feels more like a calm , methodical
breaking of specific items .
and coupled with the dining table ,
that &apos;s very elaborate staging .
it &apos;s more like pathology than a diversionary tactic .
look , the music &apos;s arranged by genre .
got big band , classical ,
jazz , and christmas music .
hey , spence .
dillon kingman &apos;s not at this apartment .
nothing on frank kingman , either .
no activity on his cell phone or credit cards .
and jenna &apos;s last social media post said that her boyfriend
was at the house the day of the murders .
i &apos;m having him brought in .
how &apos;d it go ?
i &apos;ll be the first to admit my gut &apos;s not infallible .
3 marriages and 3 divorces can attest to that .
but right now it &apos;s telling me ezra didn &apos;t do it .
and for what it &apos;s worth , my gut is with rossi on this one .
did both of your guts forget he tried to flee
the crime scene covered in blood ?
lance and ezra were a couple .
his grief seems genuine , and there
was no gunshot residue on his hands .
and all the victims were corralled one by one ,
tied up , positioned at a table , and then executed .
after which , the killer laid out a table setting
that would make martha stewart proud .
ezra was too wasted to manage all of that .
jj and reid are on their way back .
blood was also found in frank kingman &apos;s study . it &apos;s at the lab .
well , if that turns out to be frank &apos;s ,
maybe this is a kidnapping .
there is a lot of money in the family . donna &apos;s an heiress .
frank works in commercial real estate .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense as a kidnapping strategy .
murder 4 people and then expect a ransom to be paid ?
sir , i found something .
so , eldest son , dillon kingman , has a fancy car
and a fancy apartment , but no visible means of support .
so i did some digging , and presto .
money transfers from his father .
mm @-@ hmm . from one secret account to another . 5 grand a month .
how long has that been going on ?
7 years . and then 10 months ago , it stopped .
dillon &apos;s debts have been piling up big time .
that flashy sports car &apos;s about to be repossessed .
excuse me .
hi , jessica , what &apos;s up ?
when did this happen ?
no , no , you stay at the museum with jack . i &apos;ll handle it .
is everything all right , sir ?
i have to go . i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
how long had you and jenna been dating ?
a couple months .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s dead .
just yesterday we went to the mall
to get her mom a birthday gift .
were you invited to dinner last night ?
no . i was working .
um , i deliver packages for a courier service .
someone can confirm this ?
wait .
you--you think that i did it ?
we just need to establish an alibi .
my boss saw me . i put in my notice
and then finished out my shift .
why did you quit ?
i &apos;ve been meaning to for a while .
they make us use our own cars for deliveries
and don &apos;t reimburse us enough for gas .
tell us about jenna &apos;s family .
enemies ? problems ?
not really .
jenna &apos;s dad was kind of weird .
paranoid . always accusing people of things .
for instance ?
he kept telling me that i &apos;d better not get his daughter pregnant ,
which is crazy , because me and jenna weren &apos;t even having sex .
she was waiting till she got married .
what about lance and ezra ?
mr. kingman was a jerk about them , too .
jenna told me that nobody in the house
was even allowed to talk about how lance was gay .
and jenna &apos;s older brother dillon ?
i barely met him .
he and his dad hated each other , though .
it sounds like frank kingman didn &apos;t play well with others .
he didn &apos;t .
which is weird ,
because jenna &apos;s mom was really nice .
do you know what the issues were between dillon and his father ?
no . i asked jenna about it once
and she changed the subject .
she knew , she just didn &apos;t want to tell me .
just sign and initial right there , we &apos;ll be ready to go .
thank you very much , officer .
no problem , mr. hotchner .
it &apos;s tough , i know .
was there any damage ?
a broken window is all .
the store owner knows the situation .
he &apos;s sympathetic . he isn &apos;t going to press any charges .
all he wants is his window replaced .
of course .
when did your father @-@ in @-@ law sell the store ?
uh , 2008 .
i used to go there with my parents when i was a kid .
mr. brooks was so nice . he &apos;d always show me a card trick .
that sounds like him .
well , ok , i think he &apos;s ready .
roy , i brought you a coat in case you want--
shut up .
frank kingman did a lot of business in the toronto area ,
so we &apos;ve got the border patrol on alert .
you know , this is beginning to remind me of 《 clue 》 .
colonel mustard &apos;s in the billiard room with the candlestick .
well , if it &apos;s clues you &apos;re looking for ,
we might be able to help you .
prints from an extra wine glass in the kitchen sink
belong to lance kingman .
lance and his dad were supposedly in
the middle of a blowout argument ,
not sipping merlot .
i guess they worked things out .
or ezra &apos;s lying .
what if lance caved to his father &apos;s wishes
and ended things with ezra ?
that could have pushed ezra over the edge .
my money &apos;s on dillon .
deep in debt , hated his father , still awol .
and with everyone dead , maybe a lot of that
stancroft electronics money funnels his way .
frank kingman isn &apos;t necessarily dead .
what if he &apos;s the killer ?
i &apos;m not seeing the why .
same why that applies to dillon .
inheritance money .
we &apos;d better find one or both of them soon .
dillon already found us .
he just turned himself in to alexandria p.d.
they &apos;re bringing him here .
i &apos;m so sorry , aaron . how is he ?
he &apos;s resting . jessica , when was the diagnosis ?
last week .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
he &apos;s my father . he &apos;s my responsibility ,
not yours .
i was gonna talk to you about it tonight .
i even left an assisted living brochure on your desk .
ok . well , he &apos;s fine ,
and we &apos;ll both see you guys
when you get back from the museum , ok ?
thanks , aaron .
good @-@ bye .
this is ridiculous .
coming all the way up here .
i &apos;m not even dressed .
jessica said she &apos;ll bring you some clothes
when she and jack come home .
i got all kinds of clothes at my house .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve got an active case that i need to stay on top of .
thought you had an office for that .
i do , but i can stay in touch
with the phone and the computer .
i don &apos;t need no damn babysitter .
you &apos;re enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
no , i &apos;m not .
the hell you aren &apos;t . you &apos;re mad
because i &apos;ve never forgiven you for what happened .
and now this is payback .
roy , this has nothing to do with the past .
the hell it doesn &apos;t .
it has everything to do with what we are .
it &apos;s all we got .
you . me .
and the sweet past .
damn .
so , dillon told police that he had been hiking
through the great smoky mountains for the past week .
right . and elvis is alive and well
and cutting a new album in my basement .
well , shall we see what he has to say for himself ?
you &apos;ve got to find my father .
he &apos;s the one who did this .
you sound awfully certain .
everyone &apos;s dead , and he &apos;s gone .
who else could it be ?
ok . well , let &apos;s talk about who else ,
starting with you .
me ?
if i did it , why the hell would i turn myself in ?
mm . insider tip , dillon . we tend to look doubly hard
at the helpful suspects .
now , i don &apos;t suppose there was anyone on that trail in tennessee
that can verify your alibi ?
i did not kill my family .
we &apos;re wasting time right now . move on .
ok . uh , what can you tell me about ezra warren ?
lance &apos;s boyfriend ? why do you want to know about him ?
assume i &apos;ve got my reasons .
i don &apos;t know . ezra &apos;s a weird guy .
druggie . he &apos;s got a bad temper .
how do you know about his temper ?
i saw him kick my dad &apos;s jaguar once .
hard .
he put a dent in the side this big .
ok , now , what about your sister jenna ?
anything we should know about her ?
jen ...
she was just a party girl .
she liked to have fun . not really bright .
her boyfriend marc painted a much more conservative picture .
said that she was saving herself for sex until she was married .
saving herself ?
no , that ship sailed long before marc .
jenna told me the no sex part was his idea .
she wanted to jump his bones .
but why would marc lie about something like that ?
i &apos;ve got a theory .
now would be a great time to share that theory .
put it this way--
marc was a lot more into lance than my sister .
you think marc was gay .
that &apos;s how it looked to me .
so he was only dating your sister jenna
to get close to your brother .
i &apos;m telling you what i saw .
and trust me ,
ezra saw it , too .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i &apos;m sorry to bother you , but you told me to call
if i found something , and i found something .
yeah , what is it ?
ok , going through frank kingman &apos;s business , the financials .
he &apos;s been paying a consulting fee
of $ 20,000 twice a year for the last 25 years
to a c.l. gilliam and associates .
ok . firstly , there isn &apos;t nor has there ever been
a company in the united states working under that name .
secondly , the payments abruptly stopped 10 months ago .
right around the time frank stopped sending money to dillon .
exactamente . and thirdly ,
the payments were made at the same dates every year ,
may 3 and-- creepy drumroll--december 24 .
jingle the jingle bells , anyone ? hmm ?
all right , expand your search for gilliam
and see if may 3 holds any special significance
for the kingman family .
right .
so why aren &apos;t you on speaking terms with your father ?
i hate the man .
i always have .
really ?
why does that surprise you ?
personally , i would-- i would find it hard to hate someone
that gave me $ 5,000 a month for 7 years , but ...
no , that--that was just an advance on my trust fund .
of course it was .
you have a lot of money issues now , don &apos;t you , dillon ?
debt . behind on your rent .
my entire family just got murdered .
i could be next .
please , forgive me
if i &apos;m not worried about unpaid rent right now .
yeah , the thing is , dillon ,
you weren &apos;t worried two weeks ago either .
what are you talking about ?
you were pricing condos in georgetown .
expensive ones .
almost like you were expecting some sudden change of fortune .
it checks out . frank brought his jaguar
in february to the body shop to repair a
shoe @-@ sized dent on the driver &apos;s door .
so , ezra does have a history of violent behavior
towards frank kingman .
that along with being odd man out in the love triangle .
my gut hasn &apos;t gotten any more reliable since my third divorce .
thank you , penelope .
i heard you were hungry ,
so i thought i might bring you a little surprise .
what is in this ?
it &apos;s a croissant and it &apos;s still warm !
oh , you love me and i love you .
i know i flirt with derek ,
but that &apos;s like an animal blood in the nostrils type of thing .
what we have is a pure transcendent blueberry @-@ filled--
what is it ?
uh , dillon kingman &apos;s great smoky alibi just went up in smoke .
and according to his credit card ,
he went to the same local gas station twice yesterday .
2.2 gallons at 7 : 03 a.m.
and 15.4 gallons at 9 : 22 p.m.
what kind of car does he drive ?
audi a6 , 2012 .
with a highway to city ratio of 4 to 1,
averaged to 29 miles per gallon ,
which is standard for that make , model , and year ,
he traveled roughly 450 miles , which assuming one way and back
puts his destination-- 225 miles away .
i want to believe you , ezra . i really do .
but it &apos;s not getting any easier .
the car thing was a one @-@ time deal . i just lost my temper .
what about marc clifford ?
jenna &apos;s boyfriend ?
well , rumor has it that marc and lance
spent time together .
what are you getting at ? marc is straight .
is he ? because marc chose not to have sex with jenna
even though she was more than willing .
yeah , probably because he was too busy screwing around
with his other girlfriends .
that &apos;s right . he had two or three around town .
lance found out , got pissed ,
told him to knock it off .
he didn &apos;t want his sister getting hurt like that .
lance took that much interest in his sister &apos;s dating life ?
well , with what was going on with the parents , yeah .
what do you mean ?
nobody was supposed to know this , but ...
they were planning on separating .
the marriage was finished .
i made you a sandwich , roy , if you &apos;re hungry .
this is what you and jessica
have been doing behind my back .
you went through my desk ?
i &apos;m an old man with alzheimer &apos;s .
i &apos;m not responsible for my actions .
i didn &apos;t even know about the situation until today .
happy hoofers club .
that &apos;s where they take you to a mall
that you walk around . big deal , huh ?
you know , bingo tournaments .
movie nights with popcorn .
what &apos;s wrong with movie nights ?
it &apos;s a damn nursing home , that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with it !
i can go to the movies and chew popcorn by myself .
i &apos;ve been to these places before .
they take you there to shrivel up and die .
roy , the doctors have said you &apos;re gonna need more help .
doctors . i could write a book of what doctors don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m fine .
you broke into your old store this morning
and you told the police
that you were opening up for business .
i got a little mixed up .
now you &apos;re not allowed to get mixed up ?
they could have taken you to jail .
this is jail !
this is jail !
i make a mistake , a change of clothes fixes that .
you make a mistake ...
i lose my daughter .
yeah .
i &apos;m getting double @-@ teamed now ?
well , you &apos;re in twice as much trouble now .
lincoln tunnel toll booth ,
time @-@ stamped at 9 : 05 yesterday morning .
nowhere near the great smoky mountains last time i checked .
and don &apos;t bother lying about who your friend is .
we already know . vice i.d. &apos; d her .
she &apos;s a call girl who operates out of d.c.
clients are lobbyists , politicos .
i can explain that .
i drive girls to the clients
and i bring them back .
that &apos;s all .
i need the job . i &apos;m about to get evicted .
it &apos;s still illegal .
i &apos;m broke . i mean seriously , broke .
5 grand a month from your father &apos;s just hush money , huh ?
he was having an affair .
i found out by accident .
i was home from school my freshman year of college
and i saw him outside a motel with some woman .
freshman . so this affair had been going on for 7 years ?
i think it went on a lot longer than that .
why did he cut you off ?
he said he ended the affair
and came clean with my mom .
do you know who this other woman is ?
no . i only saw her that one time .
she was maybe in her early 40s ,
reddish hair , short .
ok . and we have a new frontrunner in the suspect game .
maybe when frank ended things ,
his mistress decided to destroy his family .
saving the most personal kill for the wife ,
the role she felt she deserved .
hell hath no fury .
except this scorned woman
would be closing in on 50 by now .
now , dillon said she was short .
would she have the physicality
to pull off a mass killing like this ?
what if frank and his mistress are in this together ?
ezra said frank and donna were planning to separate .
and donna had most of the money .
could be . get rid of the family , take the cash ,
disappear to the islands .
um , i &apos;m not positive , but i &apos;m pretty , pretty positive
that c.l. gilliam is ...
cora gilliam .
she &apos;s a bookkeeper who lives and works in rockville , maryland .
what makes you think she &apos;s the one ?
she &apos;s the right age . she fits the description .
she &apos;s never been married .
and she was living well above her means
until precisely 10 months ago when she had to downsize .
she moved to an apartment . she put up her house for sale .
well , let &apos;s go have a chat .
cora gilliam , fbi ! open the door .
stop !
gun !
get your hands away from the weapon !
the gun &apos;s registered to me . i &apos;m allowed to carry it .
carrying it &apos;s not the problem .
pointing it at fbi agents is the problem .
i was scared .
i saw the news reports about frank and his family .
i thought i could be next .
do you know where frank is ?
no . we haven &apos;t seen each other in nearly a year .
that &apos;s the truth .
how long were the two of you together ?
26 years .
how did it start ?
i was 19 .
single mom of a 2 @-@ year @-@ old and barely making it ,
and then i met frank .
was he married then ?
he and his wife had just come back from their honeymoon .
and that didn &apos;t send up a red flag about his character ?
when you &apos;re as desperate as i was ,
there &apos;s no such thing as a red flag .
and you yourself never got married
or had any other children ?
frank &apos;s a ... controlling person .
we had an agreement .
i would be there for him exclusively ,
and in exchange he &apos;d take care of me financially .
it sounds colder than it was . we loved each other .
and then he just suddenly ended it 10 months ago ?
it wasn &apos;t all that sudden .
things had been winding down .
after my son graduated high school 6 years ago ,
we saw each other less and less .
why ?
i don &apos;t know why .
maybe he finally just got tired of me .
men are men .
dad !
hey , buddy . how was it ?
i went inside a space capsule .
that &apos;s awesome . was it amazing ?
uh @-@ huh .
i thought i heard my favorite grandson .
look what i got , grandpa .
look at that .
a spitfire mk @-@ 2 ?
that fighter plane is the
greatest fighter plane that was ever built .
want to play my new video game ?
you want to get beat ?
you &apos;re goin &apos; down .
you-- you--
you &apos;re dreaming , boy . you &apos;re dreaming .
how &apos;s he been ?
oh , about what you &apos;d expect .
he went through my desk and found the brochure .
what did he say ?
what &apos;s this button for ?
to turn left .
not that far .
there &apos;s no way he can stay at home , is there ?
not without around @-@ the @-@ clock help .
he &apos;s on a fixed income and
there &apos;s no way that i can afford that .
i &apos;d offer to have him here , but ...
he &apos;d never do that .
i know .
i &apos;m all out of options , aaron .
my place is way too small .
his sister said that she was gonna take him ,
but 3 days ago she broke her hip .
and that place in west virginia ,
they need an answer by tomorrow ,
or otherwise they &apos;ll give it to someone else .
i &apos;m an awful person .
no , you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s gonna kill him .
he &apos;s a proud man .
and nobody wants to give up their independence .
and my whole life , he was the rock .
i have to go back to work ,
but stay for dinner and we &apos;ll both talk to him tonight . ok ?
thank you .
i don &apos;t want to do this alone .
yeah .
but that &apos;s yours .
yeah , i got the knack of it now .
now i &apos;m gonna whup you . you &apos;re toast .
you &apos;re toast .
yeah , well , we &apos;ll see .
i &apos;m the wookiee master .
you &apos;re about to be dethroned .
you let cora go ?
apparently she &apos;s still got enough money tucked away
to dial up a good lawyer .
hotch says he &apos;s on his way back .
all right , spill it , spence .
you got that thing going on .
cora said when she met frank , she had a child .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
but then she said that same kid
graduated from high school 6 years ago .
if he was two when she met frank ,
he would have graduated 10 years ago .
the math doesn &apos;t line up .
well , it does if she didn &apos;t have the child
until after she met frank kingman .
what if her kid is actually his ?
and there &apos;s no paper trail ?
sir , i really can &apos;t find anything .
cora &apos;s child must have been home @-@ schooled ,
home @-@ doctored , home everything .
frank probably demanded complete secrecy .
an illegitimate child would destroy the marriage .
i &apos;ll keep digging , but there &apos;s not--
you said the payments to
cora were on may 3 and christmas eve , right ?
yeah .
well , check to see if may 3
could be the child &apos;s birthday .
his birthday-- his birthday ! yes !
i &apos;m gonna take that nugget of brilliance and run with it .
all right , thanks .
have the police been dispatched to cora &apos;s apartment ?
they &apos;re on their way .
well , the kid had motive . seeing his mother
unceremoniously dumped by an absentee dad .
especially if he and his mom
were shut out of the family afterwards .
he came back for revenge .
ok , but why now ? did the unsub finally just snap ?
everything fell apart 10 months ago .
the secret affair was out .
the blackmail and extortion stopped .
and something happened
in the kingman family between then and now .
jenna got a new boyfriend .
now , why wouldn &apos;t marc clifford have sex with her ?
according to ezra , he wasn &apos;t gay .
and he was sexually active with other women around town ,
so it wasn &apos;t a moral issue .
well , what if he knew something she didn &apos;t ?
that she was his half @-@ sister .
sit down , mom .
we have something to celebrate .
thanks , baby girl . you &apos;re the best .
garcia says that
marc clifford grew up by the name of marc powers .
that &apos;s why he was so hard to find .
rockville p.d. says there &apos;s no sign of cora
or anybody else at her apartment .
maybe she &apos;s on the run .
or marc &apos;s already gotten to her .
this house brings back memories .
it &apos;s too bad you have to sell it .
i never should have told you the truth .
i would have figured out that you lied .
you had money , and then you didn &apos;t .
i only lied to protect you .
about who my father really was .
i can see why .
instead you gave me captain frank powers .
lost in action while gallantly serving in desert storm .

you grieving at home .
pregnant with his unborn son .
you were a little boy with no father .
you deserved a hero .
hero .
every dinner you would set out a plate for him .
remember ?
you , me , and that empty plate .
night after night after night .
keeping alive the hope that one day he would return .
i want to show you something .
he &apos;s home at last , mom ,
in the spot we always saved for him .
there &apos;s still no sign of marc or cora .
we &apos;ve put an apb out .
garcia said cora had downsized recently .
that &apos;s right . she moved into the apartment
and put her house up for sale .
we should find out if the house has sold yet .
take a seat .
sit down . take a seat .
you know how i did it ?
i got my gun and some rope ...
and i went over to their house .
lance and his dad had been arguing ,
but they stopped when i came in .
frank just gave me a disgusted look
and left the room .
i was a nuisance as usual .
i followed after frank .
i hit him with the gun .
he was out cold .
so i tied him up and went back into the dining room .
i put the gun on jenna
and made lance tie everyone to their chairs .
stop it !
sit here right now . just sit .
no . no , no .
too tight , huh ?
and then i tied lance up .
i shot them all .
afterwards , i reset the table .
and put on appropriate music .
and finally ...
it was as it should have been .
with me in my rightful spot
at the head of the table .
i brought frank back here and killed him .
but at least before he went , he knew .
you &apos;ve done a terrible thing , marc .
yeah .
i have a confession to make .
i called you a liar .
but i told you a lie , too .
what do you mean ?
i told you i shot them all .
but when i tried to pull the trigger on donna , i couldn &apos;t .
i strangled her . and as my hands
i squeezed tighter around her throat ,
i pretended that she was you , mom .
what are you gonna do to me ?
i &apos;m gonna reunite the two of you .
together at last ,
forever .
marc clifford , fbi . show me your hands .
do it now . nobody else needs to get hurt .
don &apos;t worry , mom .
i killed you already , anyway .
you &apos;re as dead as he is .
oh , god .
god ...
let &apos;s go .
dad , can we build my plane tonight ?
of course . the adults need a little time first , though , ok ?
ok .
here we go .
the talk .
dad ...
it &apos;s a good facility , roy .
it &apos;s only 3 hours away --
actually , aaron , i &apos;ve been thinking .
dad , do you remember when i told you
i got a promotion at my job last month ?
that i &apos;d be supervising a new software unit .
well , yes .
well , i was going to use the extra money
to move into an apartment closer to town ,
but if i stay in the same complex ,
we can get a two @-@ bedroom place .
i want you to live with me .
that &apos;s ...
that is very sweet of you .
but no .
why not ?
because i don &apos;t want to be a burden .
you wouldn &apos;t be .
you &apos;re really handy around the house
and i could use the help .
you &apos;re awfully quiet .
well , it &apos;s up to you .
i will say that jack would like having you close .
no happy hoofers .
no bingo tournaments .
and we can still have popcorn and movies .
ok .
ok ?
ok .
ok . i am going to go get our things .
when we get home , we can start planning
what your room &apos;s gonna look like .
great .
i think it &apos;s a good solution .
oh , i &apos;m sure you think it &apos;s a great solution . sure .
given the fact that you conceived the idea .
my brain may be checking out ,
but i &apos;m not an idiot .
jessica told me a while ago
that her promotion was in title only .
and this song and dance that you two have been doing
for my benefit ...
you &apos;re giving her the extra money , aren &apos;t you ?
good night , grandpa .
hey , big guy .
listen , you owe me a rematch on that car race thing .
you hear me ?
ok .
go get everything set up . i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
ok ?
he &apos;s all i got left of haley .
i see her in his eyes .
small things he does .
i see it , too .
you and me , we &apos;re not good , you know .
i &apos;ll never forgive you for what happened .
i wish you didn &apos;t feel that way .
oh , don &apos;t be so understanding .
for once , take the low road
and tell me to take a hike .
i think about what haley would want for this family .
well , i do , too .
she &apos;d want to be alive still ,
and she &apos;s want to be jack &apos;s mom again .
she wouldn &apos;t want us holding on to anger
or pointing fingers at each other .
i &apos;m pointing anyway .
you &apos;ll be rid of me soon enough .
the doctors told me that
there will come a day when ...
i won &apos;t know who she is .
just a stranger .
no anger .
no pain .
no regret .
you know , this disease may not be a curse after all .
come on , dad , let &apos;s go .
dad ?
coming .
all right , you lead the way .
ok .
we are made wise not by the recollection of our past ,
but by the responsibility for our future .
