&quot; with or without you &quot;
there &apos;s this thing i used to do
when i was a kid to my mom &apos;s vcr .
i &apos;d take it apart piece by piece ,
then put it back together again .
i left my phone at the lab .
by the time i figured out i left it ,
i was already at the airport coming to you .
and she picked up your phone why ?
i don &apos;t know .
she probably thought it was me .
i called her from the airport .
then she told me she spoke to you .
but inevitably ,
there was always a piece or two left over ,
something i didn &apos;t quite know what to do with .
is that is ? is that everything you have to say ?
that &apos;s all there is to say .
i &apos;ve told you everything , the whole story -- all of it .
but if you want , i &apos;ll go through it all again .
and she &apos;s your research fellow .
yes .
just your research fellow .
so , what do you do with that piece ?
meredith .
i wish i could believe you .
you can . i &apos;m here .
i know how this works .
i was your resident once .
it seems like you came home
because you thought you were in trouble .
do you try to fit it back in ?
i came home because we &apos;re in trouble .
i came home to work on this , on us .
i came home .
do you try to make it work ?
i have to get to the hospital .
can &apos;t you get somebody to cover ?
or do you decide you can live without that missing piece ?
you should spend the day with the kids . they &apos;d love it .
they really miss you .
who is next ?
uh , we &apos;re looking at neuropeptide &quot; y &quot; receptors
in marmoset brains .
great . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s great .
which one of you is doing a thing
where you &apos;re patch @-@ clamping nerve cells ?
oh , that &apos;s me .
which one of you is &quot; me &quot; ? what &apos;s your name ?
uh , collier . renee collier .
renee , how &apos;s it going ?
pretty good . how are you ?
i mean with the research , renee . how &apos;s it going ?
oh . uh , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s going pretty well .
a few bumps in the road , but all things considered ...
the synaptic timing discoveries you made
will help us here immensely .
i want to see what you &apos;re doing .
oh , sure .
i look forward to working with you .
what do you got ?
17 @-@ year @-@ old with history of biliary atresia .
chronic liver rejection .
uh , waiting on donors , but he keeps deteriorating .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m running out of ideas .
let me take a look .
i didn &apos;t pull you out of zola &apos;s dance class or something , did i ?
no , no . derek &apos;s home , though .
since when ?
last night .
and this morning .
and ?
and what ?
and do you know who answered his phone ?
his biliary outflow is strictured .
i want to examine him myself and get a new ultrasound .
owen !
uh , chief .
hey , dr. shepherd .
you finished your laminectomy in o.r. two ?
i did . uh , did you need ... ?
oh , i &apos;m just trying to see if bailey can get in here
for a bowel obstruction .
right .
o.r. &quot; s all hers .
great .
i felt like last night &apos;s business was left ... unfinished .
you felt that way , too ?
many agenda items left unchecked .
yeah , barely scratched the surface , really .
i think we need a follow @-@ up .
agreed .
when we won &apos;t be ... interrupted .
oh , my god .
hey , how about -- how about tonight , if you &apos;re not on call ?
i &apos;m not .
o @-@ okay , then .
okay .
hey , jo , i need your help .
no , i &apos;m not letting you do laundry at the house again .
alex gets crabby
when you leave your soggy clothes in the washer .
stop . i spent so much time with dr. shepherd on that brain tumor
that i &apos;m behind in like every other specialty .
i just checked my hours . i am so screwed .
suddenly it &apos;s lonely on the neuro throne .
hey , wilson , edwards .
i &apos;ve got a lacerated spleen in 20 minutes ,
and hunt had a personal matter come up .
i need someone downstairs .
start with the headache in bed 3 .
wilson , it &apos;s yours .
what did i just say ?
she said &quot; headache . &quot;
it &apos;s probably neuro .
i &apos;m doing you a favor .
fine . but if it &apos;s something good , you better call me .
fine .
i just got a page ?
oh . yeah . now , i don &apos;t want you to worry .
she &apos;s understandably embarrassed ,
so we went ahead and put her in trauma one .
richard , what are you --
okay , now , she &apos;s shaken up , okay ?
she &apos;s got a big bruise on her back ,
and -- and aside from a nasty head lac ,
there &apos;s no evidence of other injuries .
shepherd &apos;s with her now .
who are we talking about ?
i thought they told you .
mom ! what happened ? !
for heaven &apos;s sake , owen , shut that curtain .
everyone can see me .
evelyn , try not to move , okay ?
already gave half the neighborhood a free show
just by getting in the ambulance .
she fell in the shower , right through the glass door .
did you slip ? i told you you need a support bar in there .
oh , those things are so ugly .
she said she got dizzy .
dizziness , huh ?
i &apos;m not surprised with a laceration like this .
you had quite a fall .
i @-@ i think we should get a head c.t.
she said she was dizzy before the fall .
all morning , actually .
really ?
we got this from here . thank you . you can step outside .
no , i want him to say .
john was with me when it happened .
i know , mom .
you &apos;ve been great , thank you . my mom &apos;s really grateful .
but he &apos;s done his part now , mom , so ...
no , i don &apos;t mean since i fell .
he was with me when i fell .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
well , i wasn &apos;t with her in the shower .
i was , uh -- i was making us some
breakfast before i went to work .
owen , i &apos;m john .
as in ... &quot; john . &quot;
yeah , i @-@ i still don &apos;t understand .
honey , john and i , we &apos;re --
i thought you told him .
told me what ?
is somebody gonna tell me what the hell is going on ?
i think what they &apos;re trying to say
is john is ... your mother &apos;s boyfriend .
how long has this been going on ?
she was dizzy when she first got out of bed .
we thought she was just hungry , so i @-@ i --
that &apos;s not what i --
how long have you two been ...
in a relationship ?
mom , please . please don &apos;t use that word .
evelyn , any changes in vision ?
no , dear .
we &apos;ve been together a little under a year .
a year ? !
dr. webber , what do you think ?
more x @-@ rays , maybe , on her left wrist ?
uh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t realize she had hurt --
just to be safe .
sure , sure .
that &apos;s a fine idea , shepherd .
owen , john &apos;s very nice .
i think you two have a lot in common .
she talks about you all the time . she &apos;s so proud .
i &apos;m thrilled that we &apos;re finally meeting .
how old are you ? !
don &apos;t be rude .
35 .
he &apos;s young enough to be my brother .
does he have access to your financial information ,
your pension fund ?
owen hunt !
okay , pupils are equal and reactive .
this is a serious relationship .
but i &apos;d still like to get that head c.t. just to rule out ...
&quot; serious . &quot; sure , okay .
seriously weird , seriously misguided .
not that we don &apos;t have our fun .
hey , hey , hey , stay away from her ! you hear me ? !
whoa , buddy , calm down .
i &apos;m not your buddy , okay ?
i &apos;ll be changing her passwords ,
her locks , her phone number .
if you so much as attempt --
hunt !
let &apos;s take a walk .
take a walk .
hey , danny . where &apos;s your sister ?
probably trying to find more stupid stuff
to cram in this room .
dr. grey , meet danny ,
grey @-@ sloan &apos;s resident hockey freak .
nice to meet you , danny . do you mind if i , uh ...
hey , did you see the game last night ?
yeah , you owe me 10 bucks .
sharp had five shots on goal .
yeah , and none went in .
dr. karev , any news ?
we &apos;ll , uh , after today &apos;s scare ,
we ran another set of blood tests .
we think he &apos;s developing another infection .
well , can we do the catheter procedure again
and drain the infection ?
well , we can try , but ...
actually , after looking at danny &apos;s scans and ultrasounds ,
i think we could go in surgically .
could re @-@ create the biliary tree
and prevent infection from reoccurring .
is that an option ?
uh , it &apos;s a risky one in danny &apos;s state .
i @-@ i &apos;d prefer to continue with antibiotic therapy
and just keep monitoring him .
but the surgery could help danny
while he &apos;s waiting for a new liver
and possibly get him out of the hospital for a while .
well , i &apos;m in . living here sucks .
well , let &apos;s not jump into anything yet .
dr. grey and i will discuss it before we seriously consider --
well , why don &apos;t we run some more tests ,
and , uh , we &apos;ll let you know what we think , okay ?
so , you &apos;ve had this headache for a month with no relief ?
hmm . okay .
and where is the headache located ?
all over . it -- it moves around .
listen , i went to china last month .
is this the bird flu ?
or the -- the -- what -- what is it , the sars ?
it &apos;s one of those . i have a headache all the time .
i get these nosebleeds .
nosebleeds ?
yeah , the blood starts to come out ,
and then i got at it with a tissue ,
and it just goes back up .
huh .
is that normal ?
see , you &apos;re putting on a mask . i &apos;ve got the sars .
no , this is just protocol .
oh , hey , i see what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , god .
god , what ? !
that &apos;s not a nosebleed .
so , dr. avery attached the transplanted tissue to the arm .
and , as described in this morning &apos;s presentation ...
the fresh blood supply has allowed the skin to regrow
without the need for further grafts .
dr. warren ?
dr. avery will perform
a primary microvascular aterial repair first
and then follow with a venous anastomosis .
all right , matt . this all looks very good .
we &apos;re gonna see you in the o.r.
what ?
i swear that never gets old .
ah , if only that were true .
okay , guys .
excuse me .
all right .
hey .
edwards .
you need anything ?
you are pretty .
i &apos;m sorry ?
do you need anything ? do you want anything ?
okay , that &apos;s , uh -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s flattering .
but , um , i have a beautiful and very strong wife .
ew , warren . no , i want your case .
oh . no , not a chance .
i will give you $ 50 .
nah , i can &apos;t do it .
come on , i need to log more e.n.t. hours .
and how is that my problem ?
look at this .
danny &apos;s in full @-@ blown cholangitis .
what was that with danny ?
why would you bring up that surgery
without talking about it with me first ?
you brought me on as a consult for my opinion .
i was giving you my opinion .
he &apos;s barely able to keep his blood clotting .
you really think he &apos;s gonna survive a surgery that big ?
i thought that &apos;s why you brought me on ,
because you wanted some new ideas .
have you even done this procedure before ?
you came to me . you brought this case to me .
for your help .
so then listen to me .
what &apos;s going on here , mer ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
would you rather him sit around and wait for a liver and die
or let me try a surgery i know i can handle ?
what &apos;s the deal here ? is this about your streak ?
are you kidding me ?
then what ?
what &apos;s going on here ? what &apos;s your deal today ?
nothing . no deal . i have no deal .
what in the world led you to develop this technique ?
it was for a little side hobby of mine .
which is ?
i want to cure autism .
that &apos;s ambitious for a fellow .
what made you decide to tackle autism ?
1 in 68 kids isn &apos;t enough ?
usually it comes down to just one .
my little sister .
i just always wondered what she was thinking .
i hope you find that out .
hey , why didn &apos;t you answer my text ?
&apos;cause i was working .
so ?
so what ?
how is meredith ?
what do you know ?
i know she &apos;s being an ass ,
pushing a risky surgery on my patient .
she &apos;s on a streak . go for it .
who was the woman on derek &apos;s phone ?
i don &apos;t know .
she said nothing ?
yesterday , she couldn &apos;t stop talking about it .
all i know is derek came home last night .
no .
crap .
crap ? why crap ?
a woman answers his phone ,
he immediately gets on a plane
and shows up in the middle of the night .
he &apos;s here to apologize .
because he has something to apologize for .
crap .
i don &apos;t like this .
mrs. hunt , i know this is hard ,
but i need you to not move .
i think i might be done . am i done ?
not quite yet . try focusing on your breathing .
i &apos;m not usually like this .
i was in the military . i served in vietnam .
i don &apos;t panic . i think i &apos;m just upset .
well , you did have quite a fall .
not about the fall . about owen .
i didn &apos;t mean for him to find out like this .
he has a right to be a little surprised ...
shocked .
but how does he think i feel ?
a guy like john chasing after a fossil like me .
it was weeks before i even realized he was dating me .
and then , one night he kissed me ,
and ...
i &apos;m not stupid .
i know how we must look together .
i know what people must think of us .
&quot; he &apos;s conning her . she &apos;s buying him .
it &apos;s a joke . &quot;
it &apos;s what i &apos;d think .
but then he kissed me .
and when he kissed me ...
we were exactly the same age .
all those years between us disappeared .
john always says , &quot; ev ,
there &apos;s no difference between us except a bunch of years .
and , frankly , they &apos;re years i wish i &apos;d spent with you . &quot;
owen &apos;s always worried that i &apos;m lonely .
his dad died 32 years ago , so he worries .
but i &apos;m not lonely .
i &apos;m having the time of my life .
am i done ?
in order for me to get a clean c.t. scan ,
i need for you to be perfectly still , which means ...
no talking .
no talking .
john sounds amazing .
doesn &apos;t he ?
it would be so much easier if he were my age .
but i got to tell you , it &apos;s so much nicer that he isn &apos;t .
oh , god .
i know it &apos;s a little uncomfortable ,
but we can just get a good look at what &apos;s going on inside .
please don &apos;t find a tumor .
no , looks good .
your tissues look healthy .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing !
i told you to page me if you had something cool .
oh , it &apos;s not . sorry . no , it &apos;s just a --
it &apos;s just another neurotic lady
who thought her headache was a brain tumor .
so lots of , uh , ibuprofen and hand @-@ holding in here .
you should -- you should go .
find something worth your hours .
what was that ? what was that ? !
it &apos;s some kind of critter .
what do you mean , &quot; critter &quot; ?
it &apos;s alive ? something &apos;s living in my face ?
it &apos;s using your sinus cavities to move around .
oh , my god ! i don &apos;t care ! just get it out !
hang on , all right ? hang on .
let me put this mask on you .
start him on an albumin drip .
i want the surgery .
danny , we went over this . no .
i want the surgery !
dr. karev is gonna drain the fluid ,
and you &apos;re gonna feel better .
no ! i won &apos;t !
i can &apos;t keep doing this . i want the surgery .
it &apos;s really risky . your body &apos;s very weak .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
yes , i do !
i @-@ i can &apos;t go out like this ,
sitting in some hospital bed , waiting ,
propped up with my special pillows ,
staring at crap that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
some hockey puck you got signed for me out of pity ,
pictures of our dead parents
who would have known better
than to just let me sit here and rot .
all right , hey , danny .
it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s my life . it &apos;s my choice .
dr. grey , i want the surgery , and i want it today .
kathy , he &apos;s hurting right now , all right ?
once he feels better --
will he feel better ?
i mean , he &apos;s right . it is his life .
he has so little control over anything else ,
but he &apos;s almost 18 .
he should get a say in what he does in his life , right ?
that &apos;s what he wants .
i mean , he just wants to go to games and hang out with girls
and junk out on popcorn with his friends at the movies .
he &apos;s miserable and terrified .
and i don &apos;t blame him .
just -- i &apos;ll give consent . just do the surgery .
absolutely .
you &apos;re still his guardian . you don &apos;t have to do this .
just tell me that it &apos;s going to work .
i spent my entire adult life taking care of him .
now he wants a life , but he &apos;s my life .
i don &apos;t know what i would do without him .
renee ?
oh , god .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m just , uh --
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i broke a cup .
i &apos;ll replace it .
i &apos;m not worried about the cup .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m sorry . have a good night .
do you want to talk about it ?
i &apos;ve been measuring levels of activity
and inhibitory cells in vpa rat brains .
for months , i &apos;ve been patching and patching --
for more than a year , actually .
i &apos;ve been looking for abnormalities ,
and nothing shows up .
nothing .
i &apos;m wasting my time .
do you know why you feel like that ?
it &apos;s because you &apos;re close .
you &apos;re very close to a breakthrough .
i &apos;ve been there . it &apos;s tedious .
it takes patience and concentration .
and you want it . you want a breakthrough so bad
that you have to break something .
i @-@ i &apos;ll replace the cup . i &apos;m --
stop talking about the cup .
keep going .
you &apos;re right at the line .
you &apos;re gonna cross it .
don &apos;t stop .
you should get some sleep .
yeah .
i &apos;ll try .
hey , so , i spoke to dr. webber . your c.t. results came back .
you have a mild head contusion ,
so they &apos;re gonna keep an eye on it overnight .
i suppose you have questions .
no .
um i brought you some , uh , pant--
uh , some ladies &apos; underthings and , uh socks
in case your , you know -- your feet get cold .
patients are always telling me that their feet get cold ,
so i thought &quot; socks . &quot;
i spent your whole childhood telling you to be sure
you had clean socks and underwear on
in case you were in an accident .
here i am .
no socks , no underwear .
owen , ask .
i @-@ it &apos;s none of my business .
i don &apos;t need to -- - we met in a writer &apos;s group .
i didn &apos;t know you wrote .
just stories .
little things about my time in the service .
john liked them .
one night , we stayed late talking about my stories ,
and he shared some of his .
he -- he did a stint in the navy .
and after a while ,
we realized we were the only ones still around .
he asked if i wanted to go for some coffee
and keep the conversation going .
i did .
that was six months ago .
and somehow we &apos;ve never run out of things to talk about .
so , that &apos;s it ? just coffee and conversation ?
do you really want to hear about your mother &apos;s sex life ?
okay , um ...
owen , does it matter that he &apos;s not what you pictured ?
yes , it matters , &apos; cause there &apos;s something wrong here .
he &apos;s half your age . he &apos;s younger than i am .
mom , i think he &apos;s using you .
for what ? for sex ?
well , god bless him .
stop it . that &apos;s not what i meant .
for money . your pension , maybe .
that &apos;s what these guys do .
they -- they prey on older people .
what do you mean , &quot; these guys &quot; ? john &apos;s not &quot; these guys . &quot;
there &apos;s no way a man like that could ...
could love me ?
is that what you were gonna say ?
there &apos;s no way a man like that could love me .
mom .
just think about it .
for a moment , put your heart aside and try to think about it .
you should have told me right away .
i would have never let this guy do this to you .
it &apos;s not right .
it feels right .
i want you to go .
mom .
i don &apos;t want to see anyone make a fool out of you .
and i won &apos;t let anybody hurt you .
please .
i like your mom . she &apos;s funny and smart .
i mean , i &apos;m not surprised .
is there a point ?
owen , if it were my mom , i would be thrown , too ,
but from talking to her ,
it seems like they &apos;re really in love .
you spent 15 minutes listening to her ,
and you have this whole thing figured out .
i know nothing about this guy .
you don &apos;t know my mother ,
so please just stay the hell out of it .
we went to this beautiful lake ...
shh . don &apos;t speak .
... with these waterfalls .
you &apos;ll scare him away .
everyone on my tour was jumping off this big , high ledge into the lake .
i was so terrified to do it , but it was like
the big , high point of the trip for them .
i didn &apos;t want to be the only one who didn &apos;t go .
i didn &apos;t want to miss out on the high point .
i &apos;m so glad i jumped . it was exhilarating .
amazing . it changed me forever .
please stop talking .
do you think that &apos;s when i got this thing in me ?
andrea , don &apos;t move .
come to mama .
oh , no ! stop , stop , stop !
it &apos;s grabbing . it &apos;s grabbing . - just a little more . just a little --
stop it !
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna take a little break .
then we &apos;ll try again .
i &apos;m not doing that again .
i &apos;m not doing it .
we &apos;ll need to be very careful when connecting the graft
to the posterior auricular artery .
and ... there .
scissors , please .
uh , hello , dr. bailey .
bribery , edwards ?
you think bribery is an appropriate standard of practice
in this hospital , bribing for surgeries ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you tried to bribe your way onto that surgery down there .
warren .
sleeping with the enemy .
you demean yourself , and you demean medicine .
i &apos;m sorry .
and it doesn &apos;t matter , anyway . it didn &apos;t work .
$ 50 ?
$ 50 .
do you know how much a full ear replantation
would have gone for in my day ?
$ 100 , easy .
$ 120 , even , plus two weeks of night call .
you add in inflation ,
you should have offered him $ 175 , at least .
$ 50 .
we can &apos;t even go to dinner for $ 50 .
gelfoam , please . i need more retraction .
any more , and we &apos;ll need to extend the incision .
well , then we &apos;ll extend the incision .
i need better visualization of the bile duct .
his hepatic veins are bleeding .
his liver &apos;s too scarred .
we need to stop , give him extra clotting factors .
we can &apos;t stop .
i told you it was a bad idea .
his body can &apos;t take it . he &apos;s already deteriorating .
let &apos;s pack him and get out .
we can &apos;t close him now . he will die .
he &apos;ll be dead in a week .
how long has he been on the transplant list ?
will he get a liver this week ?
i could do a hepatico @-@ j to decompress the liver .
that &apos;s crazy . it &apos;ll never work .
it &apos;s a chance .
i didn &apos;t ask you for a chance . i asked you for an opinion .
which i gave you , which i &apos;m giving you now ,
which you refuse to listen to .
you hijacked my patient
to perform a procedure that could kill him .
if you don &apos;t like my surgical plan ,
you are free to leave .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
damn it . he &apos;s dropping his pressure .
i &apos;m putting a shunt in from the splenic to the ivc .
the anastomosis is not gonna hold .
it &apos;s the only way . right angle .
hello ?
what are you doing right now ?
i was
it is 1 a.m.
how soon can you be at the lab ?
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about your research .
you &apos;ve been thinking about my research ?
come here . come on . let me show you . look .
oh , my god .
yeah , i know . i told you .
it &apos;s all about the excitatory pathways .
here , look .
see ?
yeah .
your blood pressure &apos;s dropped since the last check .
you feeling okay ?
i feel like i &apos;m being made too much fuss over
&apos;cause my son &apos;s the boss .
okay , so , uh , the cat &apos;s fed ,
um , i got the recycling down to the curb .
i brought you some clothes and stuff .
i couldn &apos;t find your journal ,
so i just picked you up a fresh one down in the gift shop .
you didn &apos;t have to do all that .
hey .
hey , are you -- are you okay ?
is she okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;ve very , very sweet .
but i don &apos;t think ...
we shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
not anymore .
what ?
you don &apos;t need this , john --
a frail , old woman who falls in the shower .
stop it . is this -- is this because owen --
he &apos;s my son .
and he &apos;s been to hell and back .
and he does everything for me .
and if he feels that it isn &apos;t --
hey , hey , evelyn .
do yo believe that ?
we need help in here !
okay , her abdomen &apos;s rigid .
evelyn .
step outside , all right ?
blood pressure &apos;s dropping drastically .
she &apos;s going into shock .
page pierce , and get owen hunt .
i &apos;m right here .
shunt is in .
bleeding seems under control .
you seem surprised .
i &apos;m glad it worked .
you &apos;ve questioned every move i &apos;ve made .
you , of all people ? i need you to believe in me .
crap , there &apos;s --
i see it . the anastomosis is leaking .
come on , danny .
what happened ? !
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm .
the dizziness , the bruising on her back --
they must have been caused by a sentinel bleed .
what the hell , richard ? how &apos;d you not see this ?
hey , all of her injuries were consistent with her fall .
none of us would have thought to look any further .
i know you &apos;re worried , but we have her .
i need you to tell me why you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m gonna go . she told me to go .
good . go .
i will .
but not until i know she &apos;s all right .
i know she doesn &apos;t want me , and that &apos;s fine .
but i can &apos;t just walk away not knowing how she is .
i can &apos;t just walk away from ...
i know she doesn &apos;t want me , but i want her .
i have to know that she &apos;s out there in the world okay .
i can &apos;t go not knowing .
she &apos;ll never even know i was here .
you don &apos;t have to say anything to her .
i &apos;ll go the moment that i know .
but until then , i am sitting here in this chair ,
until i know that evelyn is all right .
hey . he &apos;s okay , right ? the surgery worked ?
can i see him ?
dr. grey ?
kathy , i &apos;m --
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
no !
oh , my god .

tell me that &apos;s not -- - yes .
the vpa cells are connecting almost twice the rate of normal cells .
this is amazing !
you &apos;re amazing ! i could kiss you .
uh .. uh , i mean , i won &apos;t .
obviously i won &apos;t . sorry .
but all the wrong turns and brick walls ,
and finding the answer is such a high .
it &apos;s getting late .
um ... i should go .
do you have to ?
meredith !
mer , stop !
he should have lived .
he couldn &apos;t .
you saw how messed up his liver was .
i should have saved him .
i could have saved him if you weren &apos;t bringing me down ...
with your doubting and second @-@ guessing and distracting me .
mer .
he should have lived .
he should have lived ! he should have lived .
stop . get off ! stop it !
come on . no .
i &apos;m mad at you .
no , you &apos;re not .
i am .
no , you &apos;re mad at derek .
you want to take it out on me , go on .
you want to yell and hit and scream
&apos;cause things are hard at home , okay .
you want to be a mess , be a mess .
i don &apos;t care . i can take it .
but in that o.r. --
you are not a mess in that o.r.
you tried . we both did .
you didn &apos;t do this .
you didn &apos;t kill that kid , okay ?
so keep it together .
we were able to repair her aneurysm .
so she &apos;s gonna be okay ?
yeah , that &apos;s good .
she should recovery nicely . that was one lucky fall .
if her aneurysm had ruptured outside of the hospital ,
she wouldn &apos;t have made it .
all right .
thank you .
thanks .
tell your mom i said goodbye .
i ordered this book that she &apos;s been searching for forever .
it was out of print . i found it . i had it shipped .
uh , it arrived yesterday .
um , it &apos;s in this little brown package
on the table near the blue sofa .
will you make sure she gets it ?
thanks .
john , wait .
i told you to go .
yeah , well , owen suggested that you might be full of crap .
i asked him to stick around .
we &apos;ve been talking .
oh , god . i wish you didn &apos;t have to see me like this .
i look so --
you look beautiful .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
okay , just relax , andrea .
dr. wilson said i could have a look at
your little buddy there ?
no .
okay , i feel for you . i do .
but you got to let us yank him out .
wilson !
but it hurts .
i think he has teeth .
i know you &apos;re scared .
he is , too . he doesn &apos;t want to come out .
he has found the perfect ... safe home .
the tissues in your sinuses are warm and damp and cozy .
but they &apos;re also tasty , and he &apos;s gonna get hungry ,
and then he &apos;s gonna start chomping away .
and the more he chomps through them ,
the closer he &apos;s gonna get to your brain .
and your brain -- oh , your brain .
that &apos;ll -- that &apos;ll be like christmas dinner .
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s right here . get him out .
okay , okay , andrea . this is what i want you to do .
i want you to take a great big sniff .
what ? sniff in ? no way .
h @-@ he &apos;ll end up somewhere behind my eyeball .
no , he won &apos;t . your sinuses will contract .
it &apos;ll help . i promise . ready ?
sniff .
there you are , you little bugger .
oh , my god .
oh , my god . it &apos;s so gross .
and he was in my face . what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s a leech . poor little guy .
do you want to keep him ?
if you don &apos;t , i will .
what ? what is that ?
i pulled it out of a lady &apos;s nose .
this little sucker had me working on one single case
all day .
all day ?
all day .
so you just logged six , seven uninterrupted hours of trauma
without even trying ,
all because of a stupid leech up someone &apos;s stupid nose ?
i think i &apos;m gonna name him herbie .
i &apos;m gonna put herbie up your nose while you sleep .
amelia . i am so ...
sorry ?
for being such a jackass ?
and for how i spoke to you . i was out of line .
you think ?
i am sorry .
good .
don &apos;t go . not like this .
it just took me by surprise .
i @-@ i &apos;m not always good with surprises .
me either .
maybe we should get over that .
when we go without certain things for long enough ,
it &apos;s easy to forget ...
just how much we need them .
we forget what we had once .
we forget what it &apos;s like to live with a thing ...
... not that we need , but that we want .
the kids ?
just put them to bed .
derek ?
wait . just ...
derek ?
just wait .
i can &apos;t do this . i &apos;m sorry .
tell me that this is all in my head ,
that there isn &apos;t something between us .
i know it &apos;s there .
i love my wife .
i &apos;m married .
i don &apos;t want anything other than what i have with her .
i have to go .
right now i have to go .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s so important for us to remind ourselves ,
for us to remember .
i am calling post @-@ it .
zola and bailey
and tumors on the walls and ferry boat scrub caps .
i thought d.c. was everything .
and i was wrong .
you ...
you .
you &apos;re everything .
i love you ,
and i &apos;m not gonna stop loving you .
meredith , i can &apos;t live without you .
i don &apos;t want to live without you .
and i &apos;m gonna do everything in my power to prove it .
i can live without you .
but i don &apos;t want to .
i don &apos;t ever want to .
just because we can live without something ,
it doesn &apos;t mean we have to .
