sorry to keep you waiting , mr. medina .
the eve before trial-- always a nightmare .
you &apos;ve met kalinda ?
no .
i &apos;m kalinda .
hal peterman speaks highly of you .
he says you helped him
on the michigan river killings .
and our client suggested we meet .
yes , i &apos;ve met mr. bauer .
i like him .
i do , too .
it &apos;s just that we already have a jury consultant ,
and actually , we already have a jury .
i know . i don &apos;t pick juries .
oh . then , what do you do ?
i read a jury &apos;s micro @-@ expressions
to make sure that you are persuading them ... or not .
micro @-@ expressions ?
uh , fleeting emotional displays
revealing a person &apos;s true feelings .
and how much
do you charge for this ... service ?
$ 60,000 a week .
or $ 250,000 for the full trial .
can we try a test ?
sure .
what does this micro @-@ expression mean ?
it &apos;s prejudicial .
so you think the prosecution
won &apos;t try to admit it ?
i know they will .
but the judge will see your job
is irrelevant to the crime .
just ... people hate what i do .
spam . search engine optimization .
don &apos;t worry .
the prosecution will be too busy shoring up motive .
they need to show that you killed your father
to keep him from changing his will .
my dad was my best friend .
i would never hurt him .
get a good night &apos;s sleep .
it &apos;s good to have you back .
thanks .
i heard a lot happened .
60 grand a week .
contract him for two .
and stop by my office afterwards .
i have a quick thing on stanton .
sure .
really ?
a jury whisperer ?
hey , if the client wants to pay .
use him as a tool .
do you have a second ?
you need to talk to diane .
i think you already know i did talk to diane .
i know you threatened to bar her from her office ,
with security guards .
diane is going out on her own .
she &apos;s poaching clients , partners--
what would you do ?
calm her .
we need to keep her on the reservation
for two more months .
why ?
i &apos;m bringing in an independent expenditure only committee .
a super pac ?
yes . one of the biggest .
$ 100 million of unlimited corporate spending .
but we need to stay whole another two months .
we can &apos;t scare them off with civil war .
and after two months ?
we push her out .
so , calm the waters .
keep diane from leaving .
i &apos;m leaving .
you &apos;re leaving ?
okay . where are you leaving ?
lockhart / gardner .
do you need references ?
i made a mistake , cary , letting you go .
i &apos;ve watched you grow
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
and i have to admit ... i &apos;ve been awestruck .
i like the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i know you do . it &apos;s a good boot camp .
but at a certain point ,
you need to get back in the game .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m in the game ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re being paid as if you &apos;re in the game .
i &apos;m starting a new firm--
with david lee , julius cain--
and i want to offer you a key seat at the table .
how key ?
senior associate .
two @-@ year path to equity partnership .
who else is going ?
samuels ...
hunter , bachner ,
mazin .
kalinda ?
i don &apos;t know .
she plays it close to the vest ,
but , um ... she &apos;s unhappy .
alicia ?
i ... i asked her .
my guess is she stays with will .
i &apos;ll consider it .
good .
i need to know in a week .
is that doable ?
very .
good luck in court tomorrow .
i don &apos;t know why we &apos;re having this conversation .
really .
just the polling . nothing else .
the candidate &apos;s here ?
yeah .
eli , come over here .
eli , meet adam . adam , eli .
ah . eli gold ,
&quot; the terror of michigan avenue . &quot;
uh , just dropping by for a visit ?
a visit with gifts .
oh , god ...
what was her name ?
it was , uh , melissa ...
melissa ! advance team in 2004 .
ah , this girl right out of nyu--
she brought in chili and gave everybody food poisoning .
i mean , people ...
people were puking for days . anyway ...
adam &apos;s got some ideas for fund @-@ raising .
really ?
yeah , well , i ... i heard you were struggling a bit .
momentarily .
yeah , but it &apos;s the impression .
and you know how impressions
become facts with big donors .
adam did some good work for me on my first run ,
and i just thought he could do the same here .
i mean , that is , if it works for you two .
i &apos;m just here to help ... not get in your way .
it &apos;s republican money .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know that .
they want you to play spoiler .
they want to damage the democrats going into fall .
he &apos;s not coming in above you , eli .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
yes , it is-- and i &apos;m telling you right now--
i am looking you in the eye-- you are the boss .
adam boras works for you .
but we need cash , right now , or it &apos;s over .
and if there are strings attached ?
we say , &quot; no , thank you . &quot;
and we hold our heads high when we lose .
make this happen .
oh , good . you &apos;re on time .
what are you doing , playing dress @-@ up ?
we &apos;re a little bit behind on the stanton suit ,
so i &apos;m going to need you to help the associates ,
run some background checks today .
did you hear me ?
they &apos;re real ?
yes . reading glasses .
look , you tell bond to call me in an hour .
kalinda , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re getting this .
i assigned you a task :
help the associates on stanton . i need it done now .
look , we &apos;ve had our fun and games ,
but it &apos;s over .
i &apos;ve been made your supervisor .
you know what ? that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good . have a laugh .
have a ... have a big laugh , okay ?
and go outside , and then compose yourself .
and then come back in , ready to work .
thank you .
for what ?
your client didn &apos;t want to be written out of a will ,
so he pushed his rich father out of a 12th @-@ floor window .
have you seen these photos ?
yeah , and they look pretty prejudicial to me .
my guess is the jury never sees them .
you now what they did in roman times
to people who killed their fathers ?
put them in a sack with a snake , a chicken and a dog ,
and threw them in a river .
are we really plea @-@ bargaining down from roman times ?
what &apos;ll you give me , just a chicken ?
bauer confesses to his father &apos;s murder ,
and we &apos;ll bump it down to ...
twenty @-@ five .
twenty @-@ five years .
now , that &apos;s a good day &apos;s work for gardner , bond .
hey , hold on one second , cary .
your honor !
no , his honor weldon .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re plea @-@ bargaining
during the middle of your game .
i &apos;m sorry , cary . could you hold on one more second ?
your honor , it &apos;s your day to collect cell phones .
girlfriend ?
yeah . her place or mine .
real negotiation .
i &apos;ll be right with you , honey .
think that chicken in the sack &apos;s
looking pretty good about now , cicero .
let &apos;s talk manslaughter . two years .
we can get a recusal .
yeah , that &apos;s a good idea .
judges love to be asked to recuse themselves
on the first day of trial .
we &apos;ll take it to the chief judge .
hold on . i think he &apos;s here , too .
and don &apos;t get all outraged .
the state &apos;s attorney plays poker
with half the judges in cook county .
and ms. pine ,
you play tennis with chief adler , don &apos;t you ?
look , cary , i &apos;ll be playing for the next two hours .
phone my cell , or we &apos;re going to court .
we can offer second @-@ degree .
no .
a year ago , this guy killed a man ,
and the jury will see that .
and judge weldon ?
will &apos;s playing basketball with him , that &apos;s all .
unless he can play with the whole jury ,
i say we trust the evidence .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry . you were saying something about skills ?
what are you doing ?
nothing .
at least look like you &apos;re trying .
what , you afraid to d me up ?
ball in .
you &apos;re going to guard me now , will ?
i &apos;ll guard you .
you &apos;ll try .
what the hell was that ?
what ? you said to guard you .
i didn &apos;t say mug me !
you want to call the foul , call the foul .
ball up .
hey , sorry about that back there .
i got a little carried away . no second gear .
we &apos;re good , right ?
just messing with you .
yeah , we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good .
you sure ?
yes . what , you want me not to be ?
no , no . as long as we &apos;re cool .
let &apos;s go .
no , no , i ... i think i &apos;m a bit tired .
i &apos;m heading home .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry .
excuse me ?
don &apos;t make this harder .
no , i literally didn &apos;t hear what you said .
i &apos;m sorry that i threatened to bar you from work .
i &apos;m sorry that i lost my cool .
so what do we do ?
i don &apos;t want you to leave .
i want to make things different , so you don &apos;t leave .
you &apos;ll stop seeing other women ?
so what do you want ?
i want transparency .
i want us to share our client lists .
share , as in ... ?
meetings , calls ... everything .
now , that would worry me if you were leaving ,
because that would mean you have time
to solicit my clients .
so it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m not leaving .
as you can see , your honor ,
they &apos;re highly prejudicial .
and highly accurate .
overruled .
it &apos;s best evidence . what else ?
sorry , your honor . i was , delayed .
let the record reflect that mr. gardner
has joined our little party .
anything else , counselors ?
your honor , we believe our client &apos;s profession
is irrelevant to this crime .
and every reference to it would be prejudicial .
we agree ,
and we will make no such reference .
good . agreement . how refreshing .
but we ask for the inclusion of evidence of the defendant &apos;s drinking .
he &apos;s denied this .
yes , and we would argue
this denial is why the victim threatened to write your client out of his will .
we ask to include photographic evidence
of the defendant with an alcoholic beverage .
when was this ?
a world war ii reenactment , october 2009 .
we found this photograph during a search
of the defendant &apos;s apartment .
objection , your honor .
you &apos;re kidding me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
is that not your client holding a beer ?
yes , and we would stipulate
he had the occasional beer , but ...
well , we don &apos;t have to stipulate .
we have a photograph proving it .
your honor , our client is a world war ii buff .
it &apos;s just his hobby . but without context ...
then we suggest the defense give it context .
your honor , this is not about drinking .
this is about playing on a jury &apos;s bias .
this is about seeing our client as a nazi .
i think the jury is smart enough to distinguish
between a world war ii buff and a murderer . overruled .
let &apos;s get this started .
there was no sign of forced entry .
there was blood from the victim on the balcony , here .
and the victim was discovered 12 stories below .
why did you arrest mr. bauer ?
forensic technicians found dna
under the victim &apos;s fingernails , which matched mr . scott bauer .
neighbors had also complained of hearing an argument
between mr. bauer and his father .
and then you searched mr. bauer &apos;s home ?
yes , sir .
and what did you find ?
this photo shows mr. bauer holding a beer .
is that correct ?
yes . in his right hand .
and he claimed he didn &apos;t drink-- is that correct ?
there are seven universal emotions :
disgust , anger , fear ...
just the bottom line .
four jurors
were moved to brief micro @-@ bursts of disgust .
at the crime scene photos ?
no . no , the crime photos created universal disgust .
the photos of mr. bauer
engendered feelings of directed disgust at mr. bauer .
great . they think we have colonel klink as a client .
we still have the robbery evidence .
kalinda , can you get everything together on the robberies ?
no .
look , i don &apos;t want to have to go over your head .
good , because there is no over my head .
you spent too much on push polling ,
and now your ego won &apos;t let you back down .
i &apos;ve brought in the cash that--
which buys you a place at the table .
welcome .
the most i have to do is listen to you .
i have listened , and i have found you wanting .
unless that &apos;s buddha and jesus on speed dial ,
i don &apos;t think we have much to talk about .
jackie , how are you ?
yeah .
yeah . hi . it &apos;s adam .
you know , it &apos;s funny . i &apos;m sitting right here with eli gold .
i &apos;m sorry-- do you know peter &apos;s mother ?
we became friends during the &apos; 04 campaign .
she &apos;s the one who phoned me to help .
no . no , no , no , no .
we &apos;re playing nice .
you are such a kidder .
you said there were signs of a struggle , detective ?
i did , yes .
and you had been in the neighborhood a week earlier
and found a similar scene , hadn &apos;t you ?
objection . irrelevant and immaterial .
overruled . you may answer .
your honor , may we approach the bench ?
you may .
you &apos;ll have to excuse us .
we &apos;re not being rude intentionally .
your honor , the defense is trying to draw a connection
between this murder and three unsolved robberies
in the neighborhood . we would ask for a proffer
oh , come on .
before they continue with this line of questioning .
there was no sign of forced entry .
there was no sign of forced entry
in the other burglaries , either .
doors were chosen without peep holes
so the victim would come to the door .
the police cross @-@ referenced the victims &apos; belongings with an inventory
filed with his insurance carrier .
nothing was missing .
then let the prosecution argue that ,
and let the jury decide , your honor .
i &apos;m siding with the prosecution on this .
unless you can present evidence
to support a theory of robbery ,
i &apos;ll sustain the objection .
what objection ? there was none .
objection .
sustained .
do you have a problem , mr. gardner ?
should i have a problem ?
well , that &apos;s up to you , isn &apos;t it ?
could &apos;ve gone either way .
no . he &apos;s deciding against us .
what do you want to do ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
you .
what &apos;s your address ?
my address ?
your old address , before you worked here .
2266 weyburn . why ?
i took this from blake &apos;s car .
and for some reason , it has your old address in it .
what ?
he also wrote down a name .
um , marcie raines ?
that was my neighbor .
someone he interviewed over a month ago .
what are you doing ?
excuse me ?
what are you doing investigating me ?
you talked to my neighbor ? look ...
who the hell told you you could talk to my neighbor ?
look , alicia ...
don &apos;t you dare try to calm me .
it was just a simple background check .
by who ?
who told you to background @-@ check ?
i unfortunately can &apos;t say .
don &apos;t you ever look into my background again .
do you have a minute ?
sure .
oh , that &apos;s right .
you wanted to talk when things calmed down .
during the death row appeal ,
you said you wanted to talk about something .
oh , no . i mean , yes .
at some point .
but this is something else .
someone told blake to do a background check on me .
some ... what ? !
he investigated my old neighborhood .
he talked to my old neighbors .
he said it was a background check .
what &apos;s going on ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s just ... no , you don &apos;t have to explain .
i &apos;ll find out . i didn &apos;t ask for it .
diane didn &apos;t ask for it .
and bond ?
i &apos;ll find out .
that &apos;s not what i wanted to talk about
it ...
i know what it is .
you ... ?
how do you know ?
diane told me .
are we possibly talking about two different things ?
diane asked you to join her at her new firm .
yes .
that &apos;s what it was .
i wanted to tell you , but she invoked confidentiality .
i get it . don &apos;t worry .
i don &apos;t want to go with her .
good .
i &apos;m glad .
okay . i &apos;m going now .
maybe another time , things will slow down .
yes , i phoned him .
if you don &apos;t mind me saying so ,
that was a mistake .
oh , i don &apos;t mind you saying so .
the money he brings has strings attached .
you see , mr. gold ,
i &apos;ve just been so out of touch with the campaign .
i ... i wanted to help , so i phoned an old friend ,
someone who always kept me in touch .
i just ...
haven &apos;t wanted to trouble you , ma &apos;am .
oh , yes . well , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s it .
adam doesn &apos;t mind troubling me .
your honor .
you didn &apos;t play tonight .
nope . gotta prepare for trial tomorrow .
look , judge ...
i feel like the other night , you and i got into it and ...
it was just a game . that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ve already forgotten about it .
me , too .
except , in court , it feels like ...
you know .
no . i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
you &apos;re not going to make this easy for me , are you ?
look , if you &apos;re trying to
accuse me of something , counselor ,
why don &apos;t you just come out and say it ?
okay .
you &apos;re mad because i fouled you ,
and you &apos;re taxing me in court because of it .
you &apos;re letting the sa &apos;s office
put any damn thing they want into evidence .
maybe the sa &apos;s office would like to know
that you &apos;re having ex parte discussions with me ,
about the case , behind their back .
watch it , will .
no , you watch it . you &apos;re the ...
you need to recuse yourself .
i &apos;m asking you to recuse yourself .
no .
then , let me withdraw ,
because right now i &apos;m doing a disservice to my client .
no . we have got a jury .
i am not giving anyone grounds for mistrial .
you took the case . you try it .
it &apos;s called defense .
you should learn to play some .
that &apos;s the one to keep your eye on .
right there in the center .
he &apos;s the leader .
now , he &apos;s not the most handsome .
he &apos;s not the richest .
he &apos;s not the ... he &apos;s not the most knowledgeable .
but he &apos;s the pack leader .
you see , people are like dogs .
the way to read them is like dogs .
it &apos;s a pack mentality .
how much do you make in a year ?
i don &apos;t know . varies .
but you work .
people actually hire you .
yes . i have an 80 % prediction rate .
yeah . i looked into your past cases .
you &apos;re very selective .
you seem to choose cases that are easy to predict .
people don &apos;t complain .
people want to believe in magic .
there . there they go .
the pack disperses .
it readjusts . it follows .
some stay behind .
that &apos;s not magic , ma &apos;am .
people are not unique .
they are as predictable as the tides ;
as trainable as pets .
here &apos;s what i think we should do .
judge weldon is biased .
i think we can get his bias to work for us .
i &apos;m going to provoke him by asking for a recusal .
and i &apos;m afraid i need you to bear the brunt of his anger .
the jury will react more if they see him
being biased against you .
you &apos;re going for jury nullification ?
yes , or a strong appeal .
we can &apos;t undo his bias , but we can push it .
okay . whatever you need .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on with blake ?
you mean my supervisor ?
what are you talking about ?
blake has been made my supervisor .
no , he hasn &apos;t .
wait .
alicia says he &apos;s been doing background checks
on the associates .
yeah . partners , too .
but i &apos;m sure it &apos;s all innocent .
anyway , i just wanted to wish you good luck .
wait . kalinda , stop .
what can i do ?
i need you here , working .
$ 50,000 a year increase .
that &apos;s ...
too much .
you just paid 120 grand for a medicine man ,
so don &apos;t talk to me about too much .
his name is adam boras .
part of peter &apos;s 2004 campaign .
he jokes a lot with peter .
talks fondly about old times .
no .
what ?
this only works when you
don &apos;t try to manipulate me , mr. gold .
you want to get rid of someone , get rid of someone .
mrs. florrick , i wanted to show you something .
excuse me .
this is from one of my friends .
you see the label on the bottle ?
it &apos;s a non @-@ alcoholic beer .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;ll tell will .
thank you . i &apos;m just nervous .
as you can imagine .
go ahead , say it .
no . no , i wasn &apos;t going to say anything .
nazis need to be defended , too .
feel better getting that out ?
jawohl .
you &apos;re right-- this boras thing is my problem .
it &apos;s just that i found out he was phoned by jackie .
that sounds about right .
i need to talk to peter
about jackie &apos;s influence in the campaign .
any thoughts on that ?
no .
thanks , anyway .
eli ...
there &apos;s only one thing jackie loves in life .
she won &apos;t listen to me , and she won &apos;t listen to you .
she &apos;ll only listen to peter .
that &apos;s how you handle jackie .
you &apos;ve got a motion , counselor , before i call the jury ?
yes , i do .
we ask you , with all due deference ,
to recuse yourself .
the motion is denied .
your honor , you have been using a private grudge
to rule from bias .
you &apos;ve got a lot of nerve .
you &apos;ve left me no other option .
please address me as &quot; your honor . &quot;
your honor ,
i fouled you in basketball .
you can sit down right now , counselor .
your bias is clear to all .
i have never held a lawyer in contempt before , mr. gardner ,
but i will break that streak
if you don &apos;t sit the hell down-- now .
call the jury .
and that &apos;s when i saw mr. bauer and his son--
there-- arguing .
and did you hear what they were arguing over ?
yes . i &apos;m not a snoop .
it &apos;s just , as the building manager ,
i hear a lot of things .
mr. bauer was a recovering alcoholic .
he expressed his disappointment
that his son was still drinking .
then he threatened to write him out of his will .
thank you , mr. kuney .
no further questions .
so , just a few questions , sir .
you &apos;ve been a manager at the apartments
for how long , mr. kuney ?
oh , my goodness .
i guess it &apos;s been ... six years .
where has the time gone ?
and you recently put new locks
on your apartment door , didn &apos;t you ?
objection . relevance .
your honor , it is relevant because
it &apos;s about the recent burglaries at the apartment .
counselor , i &apos;ve already ruled on that .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor . no harm , no foul .
excuse me ?
i said , &quot; no harm , no foul . &quot;
it &apos;s a basketball colloquialism .
yes , i know what it is .
do you have a problem ?
no , i don &apos;t , your honor .
my apologies .
may i proceed ?
if you have something to say , make a motion .
don &apos;t sneak it into the record .
of course , i wanted to work with ike ,
but he &apos;s got his minions .
we &apos;re having the status meeting in here today , peter .
oh , okay . hey , listen . adam has a great idea
of how we can get some revenue ...
hello .
mother ?
mother .
what &apos;s going on ?
jackie just wanted to come to the status meetings
to keep up on the campaign .
and you said yes ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
i just told her when we were having the meetings .
all right , well , tell her she can &apos;t .
she doesn &apos;t belong here .
no .
i &apos;d love to , peter ... she won &apos;t listen to me .
okay . you &apos;ll find the polling results on page five .
oh , is the type too small for you , mrs. florrick ?
no . no , this is perfect . thank you .
everybody , please welcome jackie .
she &apos;ll be joining us , when she can , at our status meetings .
come on . please , ignore me . please .
there &apos;s been a shift .
there was a micro @-@ burst of sympathy for mrs. florrick .
but here &apos;s the interesting thing .
that sympathy has turned into sympathy for your client .
good job .
i thought he was going to jump down your throat .
it was your idea .
okay , so we keep up the pressure .
one thing i &apos;d like to point out--
the pack leader on the jury , juror number three ,
the , uh , psychiatrist--
still showing micro @-@ bursts of contempt toward mr. bauer .
so we got a biased judge and a biased jury .
so we need to have someone for them to be biased against .
kalinda , any other suspects ?
actually , i need to ask my supervisor .
i need to talk to you a minute .
i have to catch a plane .
some last minute details on the super pac .
we &apos;ll talk later ?
no . now .
why is blake investigating us ?
&quot; us &quot; ?
my lawyers .
my equity partners .
because i needed to know who i was joining .
no . blake was investigating even after you joined .
what &apos;s going on , partner ?
what &apos;s going on is information retrieval .
that &apos;s all .
i need information--
some of it relevant , some of it not--
and i only know if something is relevant if ...
stop slinging the new age speak .
i will ask him to stop investigating .
good .
and kalinda is to be given a salary bump above blake &apos;s .
he is not her supervisor .
no .
then we got a problem , because this is the deal .
either we bump kalinda &apos;s salary above blake &apos;s ,
or the waters won &apos;t be calmed .
this is feeling a bit like groundhog day .
you going to apologize again ?
we &apos;ve been played .
we had the superior numbers .
we had the votes .
and bond played us against each other .
you thought i was plotting against you ; i wasn &apos;t .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re leaving .
we had this conversation already .
we agreed i wasn &apos;t leaving .
yes , but we were both lying .
i &apos;m listening .
i don &apos;t like being played .
so i suggest we do the same to bond .
how ?
in two months time ,
he &apos;s bringing in a super pac as a client--
$ 100 million .
at that point , bond intends to vote you out .
then he &apos;ll have the superior numbers ,
and he &apos;ll isolate me .
i say we convince him i &apos;m still on board for that plan ,
and in the meantime ...
we move against him .
okay .
okay .
let &apos;s not bicker anymore .
the problem is , there &apos;s nobody else .
there &apos;s no other way to get the robbery in .
and there &apos;s no suspects .

it &apos;s good to talk to you .
good morning .
i hope everybody had a good evening .
counselor , are you , ready for cross ?
yes , your honor .
all laced up and ready to go .
mr. kuney , you talked
about discussing many things with the victim .
what were they ?
what did i discuss ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do managers discuss with their tenants ?
i don &apos;t know .
your religion ?
objection , your honor .
i &apos;m just trying to establish
mr. kuney &apos;s familiarity with the victim .
i &apos;ll allow it .
did you argue
about your religion with mr. bauer ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t say argue .
we had , spirited discussions .
about your scientology ?
yes . he thought i was proselytizing .
i thought i was just discussing
the closed @-@ mindedness
of some countries like germany and france
who refuse to recognize scientology as a religion .
and during these spirited discussions ,
did you discuss scientology &apos;s
ambivalence toward psychology ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
when the two of you argued--
excuse me-- discussed--
these issues , did you do it--
according to your neighbors-- with raised voices ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
you have keys to mr. bauer &apos;s apartment ,
don &apos;t you , mr. kuney ?
yes .
and you are the only one who claimed to see a fight
between our client and his father .
objection .
sustained . that &apos;s enough , counselor .
no further questions , your honor .
how you doing ?
all right , hold on , tom .
was @-@ was there something that you needed ?
hey !
what ... ?
are you nuts ? !
that &apos;s mine !
get out .
you are making one big mistake .
will you escort mr. boras out ?
don &apos;t forget your coat .
hello .
oh , yes , adam ?
oh , that &apos;s awful .
oh , you better do it if that &apos;s what ... if that &apos;s what eli wants .
the third quarter has improved .
although i think there still needs to be
some belt @-@ tightening .
we still have some overcharges in litigation .
hello , diane .
derrick .
it &apos;s good to have you back .
it &apos;s good to be back .
anyway , we were discussing the third quarter results .
they &apos;re not as dire as anticipated , but ,
we still have some overcharges in litigation .
i think this will be the focus of what
we &apos;re trying to get accomplished next year .
you seem happy .
yeah , i guess i am .
made peace with yourself ?
jury &apos;s in .
you &apos;re kidding . they just went out .
yeah , 20 minutes .
should be interesting .
it &apos;s not guilty .
are you sure ?
micro @-@ bursts of calm for mr. bauer .
good job .
members of the jury , have you reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
on the charge of first degree murder ,
we find the defendant guilty .
you said ...
don &apos;t say a thing .
we &apos;ll appeal .
would the , defense
like to poll the jury ?
yes , we would , your honor .
sir ?
excuse me .
i was with the defense .
yes , i recognize you .
you don &apos;t have to answer any of my questions ,
but it helps us learn for the future .
no , i &apos;ll answer your questions .
it was just such a quick verdict .
yes , there were , uh , no disagreements .
i see .
and what decided it for you ?
&quot; what &quot; did ?
yes . i mean , obviously ,
you didn &apos;t take the manager &apos;s testimony seriously .
and the judge-- did you believe he was biased ?
oh , sure .
you did . but that didn &apos;t enter into your decision ?
no .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know .
it didn &apos;t seem to matter .
then what did matter ?
he did it .
i hope that helps .
