gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
jenny , us hanging out was just as friends .
that was my mother , and she is at canyon ranch .
you should go .
i &apos;m elliot .
how &apos;d you know what apartment i was in ?
i started on the first floor and worked my way up .
dorota , will you--
yes , of course i will marry you !
i told chuck i &apos;d take either you or the hotel .
he chose to give me you .
i did what i had to , to win .
even if it means losing me instead ?
you went up there on your own .
good @-@ bye , chuck .
what are you doing here ? boss &apos; orders .
aah ! no ! chuck !
no !
no .
no .
no .
no . no . no .
no !
up and at &apos; em , upper east siders .
it &apos;s time to awake from our slumber
and learn the hard truth ...
that some nightmares don &apos;t end once we open our eyes .
you &apos;re not gonna find anything in there .
luckily for me , i own a bar downstairs .
drink this .
look , we know this has to do
with whatever &apos;s going on between you and blair .
okay , you got the empire back .
you two should be celebrating , not fighting .
you wanna tell us what &apos;s going on ?
here .
i thought our relationship ... could withstand anything .
apparently , i was wrong .
well , you still love her , don &apos;t you ?
then show her that you &apos;re sorry .
take her to blue hill upstate
or buy her those louboutins at saks .
i &apos;d have to buy saks itself , and that still wouldn &apos;t be enough .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk to me . i &apos;ve tried .
when ?
look , you haven &apos;t been outside in days .
she asked me to leave her alone .
you don &apos;t want to wait too long , chuck ,
or she &apos;ll think you don &apos;t care .
excuse me .
you think it worked ?
well , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck with blair .
wait . what ? you &apos;re making me do this alone ?
breakfast with the humphreys , remember ?
let me know how it goes . good luck .
h @-@ hello ? hello ?
dorota ?
what on earth is going on ?
i am sorry , miss eleanor , mr. cyrus .
that was my mother .
she come with father to new york on monday .
but that &apos;s wonderful . i can &apos;t wait to meet them .
maybe we can all go have the vodka flight at the russian samovar !
we go nowhere once they see me .
my parents don &apos;t know i pregnant .
and since i not married ,
they will disown me .
or worse , they will kidnap and take back to old country .
nate !
hello , nathaniel .
i &apos;m here to see the invalid .
and not a moment too soon .
she hasn &apos;t left her room for days .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s like living with howard hughes .
blair is upstairs . i hope you can make some headway with her .
i am not allowed to cross the transom .
well , i &apos;ll do my best .
great . he sent good cop .
chuck didn &apos;t send me .
serena .
look , we &apos;re concerned about our best friends .
and whatever he did ,
i &apos;m sure you can find a suitable punishment for him .
there is no punishment for what he did .
you &apos;re blair waldorf .
&quot; punishment &quot; is your middle name .
just tell me what happened .
i can &apos;t tell anyone .
it &apos;s too awful .
there &apos;s no such thing as &quot; too awful &quot; between friends .
we don &apos;t judge , remember ?
and we can forgive anything .
you can &apos;t tell anyone , especially not serena .
not a soul . i promise .
what did chuck tell you about how he got his hotel back ?
he didn &apos;t .
he just said &quot; money solves everything . &quot;
he didn &apos;t use money .
he used me ... as a trade .
come on . no way .
he set me up to sleep with jack
in exchange for his beloved empire .
so now do you see why i couldn &apos;t tell anyone ?
oh , my god .
my slavic language skills are a little rusty ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure she just said ,
&quot; over my dead goat . &quot;
or &quot; body . &quot; the words are very similar .
cyrus , come away from there .
eavesdropping on the help is undignified .
plus , it confuses them .
oh , i haven &apos;t heard that much overwrought polish drama
since i canceled my b.a.m. subscription .
what is going on ?
from what i can gather , dorota &apos;s in a bind .
she needs to be married before her parents show up on monday .
dorota , i ... i ... i don &apos;t understand this .
why can &apos;t you and vanya just go down to city hall ?
never . first marriage happen at polish city hall .
you were married before ?
yes . i am divorced .
and one reason is because first wedding happen at city hall ,
ignoring tradition .
wedding traditions very sacred in my country .
dorota , don &apos;t be foolish .
every marriage i know fail
if wedding has no tradition .
where did you and mr. harold get married ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the reason the marriage didn &apos;t work out .
this not way it &apos;s supposed to be .
miss blair and i talk about
what wedding with vanya will be like .
it &apos;s supposed to be big ,
grand , perfect .
blair does love herself a wedding .
if i may interject ...
thank you for keeping my secret .
hey , no problem . i &apos;m just gonna tell serena to hold off
on the interrogation of you and ...
chuck .
miss blair , i am getting married !
of course you are .
i mean tomorrow .
mr. chuck is
throwing us traditional polish / russian wedding .
he said you two back together ...
he did ?
which is best news ever .
traditional wedding must have
happy couple who escort bride and groom into chapel .
is necessary for good luck in marriage .
please , miss blair ,
mr. chuck ,
will you be happy couple for vanya and me ?
well , uh , i can &apos;t speak for blair , but
it would be my great pleasure .
poor b. just realized
that chuck will do anything to keep the flame alive .
hello , beautiful .
glad you came .
as for serena ,
looks like she &apos;s playing with fire .
these venues will not do .
i know i said traditional ,
but ... bing it .
have you ever checked out the astoria world manor ?
it &apos;s queens &apos; answer to the grand ballroom at the plaza .
thank you , charles .
you didn &apos;t know about that ?
you look like you need a task .
what i need is a zofran .
all this disingenuous generosity is making me want to vomit .
there &apos;s nothing disingenuous about it .
i &apos;m happy i can give dorota and vanya
the dream wedding that they deserve .
the only reason you &apos;re giving it is so that you can spend time with me .
you know weddings are my weakness .
really ? it never occurred to me .
everything occurs to you , chuck .
blair ...
you and i are magnetic .
you can feel it .
our pull is as undeniable as ever .
it &apos;s different this time .
it doesn &apos;t have to be . i love you .
saying it was hard , but i did ,
and i &apos;ve never looked back .
so now i &apos;m asking you , please do this for me .
please forgive me .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
oh , yes ! thank god you &apos;re here .
i need help with the flowers . no , i wish i was kidding .
well , i &apos;m no florist , but i &apos;ve received
enough flowers in my day to know a thing or two .
i &apos;m all yours .
croissant ?
oh , yum . i &apos;m starved .
what , was rufus &apos; waffle iron broken ?
no , but this is gonna be a long day .
show me those flower choices .
okay , so my tisch application is in the mail ,
vanessa &apos;s out of town ,
and i just ate about 5 pounds of bisquick .
food coma film festival ? who &apos;s with me on the couch ?
i &apos;m thinking kieslowski &apos;s &quot; double life of veronique . &quot;
you &apos;re in luck , dan . we all just scored front @-@ row seats
to a live version of a polish production .
vanya and dorota are getting married tomorrow in queens ,
and they &apos;ve asked me to throw them a ,
traditional eastern european game night .
tonight , whatever that means . also , eleanor asked
if you and your sewing machine were free .
already on my way .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna come with you .
is it to help me sew or to stalk your new crush ?
it &apos;s not stalking if you know each other .
who &apos;s the lucky guy ?
his name is elliot .
i met him during nate &apos;s party .
we &apos;ve been texting , but i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s being flirty
or friendly , so ...
yeah , eric refuses to ask him out
until he knows if he &apos;s gay or not .
well , it could be totally embarrassing
if i assume one thing and he actually means another .
come on , stalker .
it &apos;s too bad lily &apos;s gonna miss the party .
and the wedding .
you could ask her to come back from canyon ranch early .
i mean , how many massages can one person get ?
this is cece and lily we &apos;re talking about .
cece needs her .
so do you .
just ask her to come home , be your date .
it &apos;ll be romantic .
heading to the florist ?
are you going with the calla lilies or the casablancas ?
you know what , chuck ?
don &apos;t even bother .
i know what you did .
blair told you .
yeah , she did . she didn &apos;t want to , but she did .
i mean , this time you have crossed a line .
in your rush to pass judgment ,
did you ever consider you don &apos;t know the entire truth ?
what exactly did blair say ?
that you traded her for the hotel .
no .
no , you deserve to be alone .
i may be heartless , but you &apos;re naive .
i made the deal ,
sure , but blair didn &apos;t know that when she went to jack .
i guess she left that part out .
i can feel your brain strain , nathaniel .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you and serena have it easy .
until now your biggest concern is whose hair is shinier .
did she tell you where she was this morning ?
she went to breakfast at the humphreys &apos; .
what does it matter ?
well , did she tell you carter baizen &apos;s back in town ?
because my friend at the st. regis did ,
and guess who he saw with carter this morning .
no , you have no idea what you &apos;re even talking about .
no , you have no idea what i &apos;m talking about ,
and that &apos;s the problem .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i was heading out .
what are you doing hiding up here ?
i just needed to be alone .
b. , i know you and chuck
are going through a hard time right now ,
but don &apos;t you at least think what he did was romantic ?
oh , my god .
this was your idea .
no . i @-@ i may have encouraged him to make a gesture ,
but throwing a whole wedding was his idea .
that &apos;s the thing with him , s. everything is a game .
but that &apos;s what makes you guys so good together .
you--you love games . it &apos;s who you are .
the last game we played , we both lost .
you and nate are lucky .
you &apos;re so good to each other .
no games , no lies , no secrets ,
just pure honesty--
that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to be .
i know that now .
how do you do it ?
you just-- you just do , i guess .
i hope it all works out .
nate archibald .
what are you doing here , baizen ?
oh , i &apos;m just dropping something off to serena .
how about you stay away form my girlfriend ?
what do you want from her , anyway ?
she &apos;s the one who wants something ,
and it looks like i &apos;m the only one who can give it to her .
i guess she hasn &apos;t told you what that is , huh ?
what can i say ?
she trusts me more than you .
i gotta run ,
but , uh , if you need anything ,
i &apos;ll be at the st. regis .
of course , serena already knows that .
was that who i think it was ?
was serena at breakfast with you guys this morning ?
yeah .
no .
why ? did she say she was ?
eleanor .
darling .
sweetheart ,
i found the perfect gift for dorota and vanya .
it &apos;s gonna knock your socks off !
that &apos;s wonderful , dear .
so much to do !
finally , jenny .
hi .
did you get the silk netting ?
enough to make monique lhuillier weep .
oh , good girl .
oh , serena . here . this is for you .
where &apos;d you get this ?
uh , from nate , who got it from carter .
surprise , s.
a special delivery , courtesy of little j.
i guess good things don &apos;t always come in small packages .
now it is time to play
traditional eastern european wedding games .
some of these games date all the way back to 14th century ,
but back then they used virgins . and today ... not so much .
first game we play is balloon game .
everybody must find partner .
you take balloon and put in between .
now when music changes , you and partner get closer .
ah . now whoever does not pop balloon wins game .
oh ! and winner ...
gets rare matryoshka doll .
okay , let &apos;s play .
hey .
traditions since the 14th century ?
what &apos;s next , raping and pillaging ?
i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t see elliot .
i waited in the lobby for , like , three hours .
i beat my high score in &quot; brickbreaker . &quot;
maybe i should just give up .
no . no , no , no . quitting is for losers ,
except oprah can get away with it ...
and , uh , maybe nate and serena .
jenny .
what ?
serena &apos;s my sister and nate &apos;s my friend .
i just want to make sure they &apos;re okay .
that &apos;s all . really .
chuck bass . i hear a lot about you .
you &apos;re infamous in brighton beach .
i &apos;m guessing so are you . but if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
we &apos;ve done something like this before , remember ?
no talking .
just dance .
i should have told you about carter .
i bumped into him on the street the other day ,
and i told him we could have coffee , and that &apos;s it .
well , that &apos;s not how carter made it seem .
you know how he is .
he convinced his fourth grade class at dalton
that barneys was named after the dinosaur .
he &apos;s a liar .
nate , if he made it seem like anything other than coffee ,
then he was just trying to upset you .
and obviously , he succeeded . come on , nate .
this is me you &apos;re talking to . you have to trust me .
you don &apos;t trust me ?
why should i trust you ? okay , the only reason we &apos;re having
this conversation right now is
because you got caught .
i was going to tell you .
when , after the fact ?
why didn &apos;t you just tell me when it happened ?
because ...
here you go .
thank you .
daniel . where &apos;s your partner ?
uh , she--she &apos;s in vermont .
i was thinking about sitting this one out .
oh . well , if you &apos;re not going to dance ,
at least make yourself useful .
these russians drink more than larry hagman on his first liver .
bartender needs more ice .
yeah , you--you do know that i &apos;m not working this party , right ?
all right , i &apos;ll do it .
thank you .
cyrus , what the hell has gotten into you ?
dorota &apos;s gift is finalized .
the papers are signed .
papers ?
what papers ? did you get her a puppy ?
even better .
an apartment .
an apartment . have you gone crazy ?
i was thinking more of a vera wang cake knife .
a cake knife is not enough .
okay .
the apartment is great . it &apos;s in queens ,
an easy commute on the subway .
why does dorota need an apartment in queens
when she lives in a penthouse on the upper east side ?
she &apos;s getting married . they have a baby on the way .
i figured--
you figured wrong .
getting dorota an apartment is highly inappropriate .
she &apos;s just a maid , for goodness sake .
but dorota &apos;s family .
she practically raised blair .
so your balloon burst , too ?
let me guess-- you overheard me and serena .
yeah . kinda couldn &apos;t help it .
look , i love serena , but i also know how she is .
i get it .
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s hard to know the truth with her .
maybe i overreacted , right ?
i get to talk to all my ex @-@ es .
maybe it &apos;s okay she had coffee with the guy .
yeah .
do you know what was in the envelope that carter gave her ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t open it .
well , we could peek inside her v.b.h ...
jenny , you can &apos;t go through serena &apos;s purse .
why would serena need a key to the st. regis ?
miss blair , you go down !
too easy .
looks like we might win .
well , you can have the doll . i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll know what to do
with five women with removable heads .
whatever the prize ...
you have to admit ...
together , we can &apos;t lose .
no matter how many weddings you plan ,
nothing can fix what happened .
what i did was wrong .
i &apos;m sorry .
but no one forced you to go up there .
i forced myself for you .
you didn &apos;t even know--
i know . i just ...
this game is over .
hey . you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not .
why do you even care ?
you &apos;ve always thought the worst of chuck and me .
you think we &apos;re horrible , depraved , soulless .
and i may have used all of those words at one point or another ,
but i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not following . what &apos;s going on ?
did--did chuck ... did chuck do something ?
no , it &apos;s not just what he did .
it &apos;s what i did .
this whole time i was blaming him , but it was me , too .
i &apos;ve become the person you always thought i was .
look , blair , you &apos;re not--
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re that bad of a person--
maybe not my type , but you &apos;re not terrible .
and--and whatever it is that happened between you and chuck ,
i &apos;m sure you can fix it , because if there was
a pair meant for one another , you know ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s you two .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
chuck and blair . blair and chuck .
i mean , who else could love me after what i &apos;ve become ?
thank you for helping me see it , humphrey .
your ice is melting .
hi . this is rufus humphrey . i &apos;ve left a few messages
for my wife lily and haven &apos;t heard back ,
and she didn &apos;t call me at our usual time .
no , i know you have rules about no phone .
uh , lily humphrey ?
maybe it &apos;s under lily van der woodsen ?
bass ?
rhodes ?
looks like lily &apos;s caught in a lie .
okay . i @-@ i must have gotten the dates wrong . thanks .
guess it &apos;s the truth that &apos;s getting massaged .
everything you said last night was true .
we do belong together .
we &apos;re both sick and twisted .
if you think about it ,
we &apos;re incredibly fortunate to have even found each other .
blair , i don &apos;t want this to be you settling ,
some sort of consolation .
we &apos;ve both hit rock bottom , chuck ,
but we &apos;ve hit it together .
at least we won &apos;t be lonely in hell .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re-- i should see if anyone needs me .
i thought you &apos;d be happy .
any luck with that elliot guy ?
uh , no . he never showed .
mm . ah , well , maybe vanya will have a cute gay cousin .
look , should we be worried that your dad isn &apos;t coming ?
uh , well , i @-@ i think he was hoping that lily would show up ,
but it &apos;ll be fine .
thanks .
hello . you &apos;ve reached the voice mail for celia rhodes .
please leave a message .
uh , cece , hi . it &apos;s rufus .
i don &apos;t know where you and lily are ,
but i know it &apos;s not canyon ranch .
we need to talk .
in russian tradition ,
before a groom can marry his bride ,
the wedding party gathers and demands
that he answer a series of questions about his beloved .
if he &apos;s unable to answer these questions
to the satisfaction of the crowd ,
the wedding cannot proceed .
vanya , are you ready ?
yeah .
that was an awkward car ride .
nate , you barely said two words to me .
look , i know you &apos;re still mad ,
but i want to tell you the truth .
then you can start by telling me
what you were doing in carter &apos;s hotel room .
i found the key , serena .
you went through my bag ?
carter is helping me find my dad .
oh , was he in carter &apos;s hotel room ?
nate , i love you . i &apos;m not interested in carter .
then why do you still have secrets with him ?
i was nervous to tell you that i was still looking for my dad .
i @-@ i felt--i felt stupid ,
like--like i &apos;d be disappointing you .
look , i told you the truth .
i don &apos;t know what else you want me to do .
i want you to stop seeing him .
i know you &apos;re upset , but that doesn &apos;t give you
the right to tell me who i can and can &apos;t see .
with carter , yes , it does .
this is the final question--
what do you love most about dorota ?
oh , this is tough question .
there &apos;s so many things i love about her .
but i think what i love most is the way i feel with her .
with dorota , i am best possible version of myself .
i have peace in my heart ,
knowing i will be good husband , good father .
i will die proud russian man ,
very much in love .
now you may officially greet your bride .
and now ... it &apos;s time to get married !
so ... will the happy couple
who will be escorting dorota and vanya into the chapel
please step forward ?
miss blair , are you ...
i can &apos;t do this .
miss blair .
i can &apos;t keep pretending , and i can &apos;t lie to you , dorota .
chuck and i aren &apos;t happy ... at all ,
and if we walk you in , your marriage will be jinxed .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t .
poor chuck .
looks like he &apos;s got a runaway bridesmaid on his hands .
i should have realized
that something was still wrong with you and mr. chuck .
but you always tell me everything .
i couldn &apos;t admit it to anyone .
i could barely admit it to myself .
and i didn &apos;t want to let you down .
i &apos;m sorry i ruined your wedding , dorota .
does vanya hate me ?
no . miss blair ,
i came to america
to start new life ,
to make new traditions .
and lucky for me ,
i find great people to do this with .
i find my family .
when i saw how happy you and vanya are ,
i realized how unhappy i am .
i wish you to be like me one day ,
to find right love ,
good love .
i don &apos;t need you to be happy couple , miss blair .
i just need you to be happy .
come on , ladies .
you have an aisle to walk down .
i just got your text . what are you doing here ?
i @-@ i told you to stay away .
i just got another call from my p.i. about your dad .
what &apos;d he say ?
he has his exact location , just a 3 @-@ hour plane ride away .
you ready for this ?
i don &apos;t know how long he &apos;ll stay there .
it &apos;s now or never .
what are you doing ?
everything &apos;s booked . this is your chance .
this time won &apos;t be like the last .
i &apos;m gonna make him see me .
thattagirl .
wait . i @-@ i should tell someone i &apos;m leaving .
no , there &apos;s no time . call from the car .
did i miss anything ?
no .
hi , eric .
hi . elliot , what are you doing here ?
i love dorota .
we &apos;re tight now . we talked about &quot; the vampire diaries &quot;
in the elevator on friday .
i was hoping you &apos;d be here .
here i am .
this is jenny , my stepsister .
hi .
and i &apos;m chelsey , his girlfriend ?
sorry .
you were right .
dorota is family .
i guess i was just too scared to admit it ,
because i didn &apos;t want to think that anyone else
could have raised my daughter better than i could have .
but you &apos;re a great mother .
i could have been better .
but there was some stuff that happened before you came along .
wait .
did you really mean what you said ?
yes . when your uncle threw me out--
wait . he threw you out ?
you didn &apos;t actually ...
why are you laughing ?
cause nothing happened . this was all for nothing .
it &apos;s not nothing . i @-@ i didn &apos;t do it , but i would have .
i want what dorota and vanya have--
real love ,
pure and simple love .
you &apos;d be bored within five minutes .
better bored than ashamed of myself .
i would do anything for you , chuck .
but what if that &apos;s wrong ?
i never thought it was possible to love someone too much ,
but maybe it is .
i don &apos;t like who i &apos;ve become with you .
wait . blair ...
don &apos;t bail on me .
we have to see this through to the end .
this is the end , chuck .
hey . have you seen serena ?
she missed the whole ceremony .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i didn &apos;t want to have to be the one to tell you this ,
but , uh ,
serena left with carter .
only a few short hours
until you &apos;ll be reunited with your dad .
what &apos;s the first thing you &apos;re gonna say
to dr . daddy van der woodsen ?
carter , how long have you known my dad &apos;s in palm beach ?
i don &apos;t know . a day or two ?
fine . a week .
a week ?
you &apos;ve known this entire time , and you haven &apos;t told me ?
nate was right . you were using this to get closer .
i was still seeing if there &apos;s something between us ,
and there obviously is .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
i have a boyfriend who i love very much .
archibald ?
you &apos;re really gonna settle for that ?
can you stop the car , please ?
get out .
what ?
don &apos;t be like this . you &apos;re just nervous about seeing your dad .
i don &apos;t need your help anymore or ever again .
i should have done this on my own from the start .
fine . if that &apos;s what you want .
keep going , please . i have a plane to catch .
good @-@ bye , baizen .
hello , palm beach .
with carter out of the picture ,
it looks like serena &apos;s making room for daddy .
one , two , three !
mazel tov !
thank you .
this is for you and this one &apos;s for you ,
from cyrus ... and me .
it &apos;s the keys to an apartment in queens ...
and it &apos;s your apartment in queens !
an apartment !
oh ! thank you !
thank you , dorota ,
for ...
everything .
miss eleanor , you &apos;ve been so kind to me all these years . oh .
i always think of you like a mother .
maybe big sister .
congratulations . thank you so much .
oh , have good health .
we got apartment ! an apartment !
cece . no , thanks for calling me back .
i was afraid you might not .
of course . i got your message .
what &apos;s been bothering you ?
i love my wife ,
but i &apos;ve had it with all her lies .
tell me what &apos;s going on
or i &apos;m-- i &apos;m walking out this door
and i &apos;m never looking back .
oh , rufus , you &apos;re right that lily &apos;s not with me ,
but more than that , it &apos;s not my place to say .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll need to get the rest from lily .
i &apos;m sorry .
maybe we should get some champagne .
bartender , a bottle and two glasses .
sure thing .
now ...
just to clarify , i do think you deserve
to be with someone who makes you happy .
well , coming as it does from someone
who dates vanessa abrams , it means very little to me .
but still , thank you , humphrey .
care for a dance ?
i guess .
follow me .
hey . come on , chuck .
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t look so surprised .
i &apos;m single now . this is who i am .
hey . wanna dance ?
um , shouldn &apos;t you be doing that with your girlfriend ?
chelsey took off .
we kind of got into a fight .
sorry .
i &apos;m not .
no , she was mad because i kept talking about this guy
that i met in the lobby of my building .
and then i dragged her out to a wedding in queens .
i guess i &apos;m a little obsessed .
i don &apos;t get it .
you like girls .
but i also like boys .
and i like you .
let &apos;s go .
hey , serena . it &apos;s jenny ,
answering , uh , nate &apos;s phone .
jenny ,
i &apos;m so glad you picked up .
do you know where nate is ?
um , no . i don &apos;t see him right now .
okay , um , if you find him ,
can you just please tell him to call me back as soon as he can ?
also , just tell him
that i love him and i don &apos;t want any more secrets .
yeah , sure .
if i , uh , if i see him , i &apos;ll give him the message .
thank you , jenny . i appreciate it .
while most people think
it &apos;s our brain that controls our actions ,
it is often our heart that gets the biggest workout .
hey , you wanna dance ?
um , yeah .
it can make us do the craziest of things ,
but it can also let us take a chance on new adventures .
because when we open our heart ,
we can explore a world of love ...
and be pleasantly surprised by the people already in our life .
but unfortunately , our hearts are very sensitive ,
and when they &apos;re broken ,
everything around us is shattered .
hello ?
dad ?
serena .
mom .
total eclipse of the heart .
