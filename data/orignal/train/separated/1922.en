"You Be Illin"
I could print a scaffolding and --
and make a biological conduit for a baby's heart.
They're not even doing that yet.
Dr. Yang hit a home run.
Thanks to her, baby Nathan is thriving.
An e-mail from the Harper Avery foundation.
What?
You're in consideration for this year's award.
We...
we are married.
We did something that wasn't responsible.
But we did it because we love each other,
and we want to spend every day together.
Emma Marling and Owen are through.
I don't think it was her idea.
Hopkins wants me!
Did they throw in a loan-repayment package
or moving expenses?
We don't have the dough, okay?
I'm postponing Hopkins till Robbins is better.
It's beautiful!
And it's gonna be ours!
I'd like to appoint you director of the residency program.
You'd be in charge of all the decisions
regarding the educational arm of this hospital.
Meredith, when the president of the United States
calls you on the phone, you can't say no to the guy.
You went back on your promise.
You say that you work so hard to change,
to become this new person, but then you do this?
She attacked me. Jo's a lunatic.
Damn it!
The average person touches their face
about 18 times every waking hour.
That leaves you susceptible
to infection about 100 times a day.
Well... bless you, sweetie.
Infection has a nasty habit
of taking advantage of our everyday behaviors.
Okay, I'm gonna call Dr. Lebackes
and move up our anoplasty
because I'm gonna be sick this afternoon.
What are you, psychic?
No, I felt it -- you know, the sick.
A kid sneezed on me. I felt it go in.
It looked around, and it sat down.
What, you felt that?
Yes, I've been doing this a while.
You start to develop a sense.
I've got seven hours, tops.
It spreads by touching doors, desks...
So let's just cancel.
No.
1 in 5,000 babies is born without --
Without a butthole, right.
With a birth defect resulting in an imperforate anus.
Alex, you need to learn this.
Well, fine.
But do I have to learn it from Dr. Butthole?
Don't call him that.
Dr. Lebackes is a great pediatric surgeon
Who specializes in anoplasty.
And you haven't even met him yet.
Oh, I know him.
These private-practice docs
are only about seeing how much they can charge.
Hey, cancel tomorrow's procedures, okay?
Why?
Because I will be sick.
Okay, I'll page you when I get a time from Lebackes.
Just tell me with your mind.
Uh-huh.
...elevator buttons,
pens,
sharing cups.
I found these payment books in a stack of mail.
These are for your student loans.
Yeah? What about them?
Have you looked at them?
You have to do something with these.
You're right. Let me see them.
...even money.
All we can do is try our best to prevent it from spreading.
We'll only be like 15 minutes late.
Oh, we wouldn't be late at all
if you just put the key on the hook.
I put it by the door so you would always know
where it is.
I know the hook. I play with the hook.
I'm not a hook guy. - Oh, real-- I'm not a --
Huh? I'm not a can't-find-my-keys kind of girl.
Mm-hmm. That's what I'm saying, though, right?
What? You do you, and I do me.
Okay.
Well, your you makes me late for our work.
Well...
Because once it's out there, the infection usually wins.
There is a viral infection
running rampant through this hospital.
It feels like flu symptoms, then G.I. stuff.
It goes without saying that soap, water,-Oh, sorry. Sorry.
And hand sanitizer are your best friends.
And if you do feel sick and you can go home,
Then go home.
Spread the word. That's all for now.
Blow, honey, and stop picking at your face.
Mom, I can blow my own nose. I'm practically a tween.
Hi, I'm Dr. Kepner. Are you Braden?
Yes, this is our little Brady bug.
Mom!
So, did you speak to our doctor?
I did. He said Braden has S.C.I.D.
Bubble boy disease.
Braden.
He knows that we hate it when he calls it that.
And he sent you here?
Yes, he's out of the country, s--
Right, but patients with
severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome
are generally advised to steer clear
of high-risk infection areas like a hospital.
Without an immune system --
We know, even a common cold can be life-threatening.
Well, he's on enzyme injections,
and they've been working very well.
And we were just so worried and -- Braden. Face.
I'm not picking at it. Just touching it.
Braden, how long have you had that?
This zit? I don't know.
I'm just gonna keep an eye on it, okay?
Geez, why not just draw an arrow and the word "Zit"?
Braden!
Last night, he got congested,
and we thought he might be getting a sinus infection,
so we called our doctor.
And he sent you here to get I.V.I.G. antibiotics and labs.
Great. Let's get him started.
Stop touching your face! - Stop touching your face!
Ross, you're on cardio. Wilson, neuro.
Edwards, you're on general with me and Grey --
Crohn's perforation.
Yes!
Uh, Warren, pit.
Out sick.
Uh, Campbell.
Oh, Campbell's out sick, too.
A third of us are down with a stomach-bug thing.
Actually, sir, I'm going home sick.
Murphy, doctors aren't sick. Patients are sick.
That's why there are doctors.
Look, unspoken rule, people --
Surgeon stays home, patient suffers,
as well as the doctors who have to cover for you.
You don't stay home.
You push through.
All right.
Wilson, pit.
Edwards, neuro.
Murphy, you're with me and Grey. Let's go.
Yes, sir.
If it's an unspoken rule,
then why did he just tell us about it?
Oh, you're just pissed 'cause you already lost the bet.
What bet?
The bet wherein the first one of us
to fall due to illness today
has to be swap monkey for a week.
What's swap monkey?
All next week, one of us doesn't like our service,
We can trade with the swap monkey,
and they can't refuse.
You just made this up.
Well, that doesn't make it any less amazing. Yeah.
I'm in.
Getting sick isn't even an option for me.
It's a huge day for the conduit trial.
I can't lose.
No, you're right.
You can't lose because Leah already did!
I did not lose. I am not going down.
You're the one who's gonna be...
Oh, god.
Where is she going?
Bathroom.
Dead man walking!
Hey!
Hey.
Excuse me.
Sorry?
I've been waiting a long time.
Oh, uh, I see.
Thank you for your patience.
No, no, this isn't patience. I can't move my mouth.
Say what?
He says he's a dummy who cut himself composting
and refused to get a tetanus shot or get it cleaned.
I'm his brother, Abraham.
Logan, they didn't have coconut water.
All they had was soda.
No!
That stuff's poison. Get out of here.
There it is. Everything's poison.
This looks like risus sardonicus,
causing your muscles to tighten.
And with a cut like that, tetanus is more than likely.
So I'm gonna re-clean the wound,
and I strongly suggest
tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin.
See, buddy?
You take the meds, we get out of here,
and you can get right back to suckling mother nature's teat.
No, it's poison.
I can assure you that it isn't.
Poison!
You want to hit him, or can I?
Ivy McNeil, 15,end-stage heart failure
due to dilated cardiomyopathy.
She's been on the transplant list
for approximately four months.
Until today, right?
Looks like it.
The donor's heart's being evaluated right now,
and if all goes well, we should be taking you up soon.
I don't believe it.
Where are the rest of you?
It's usually much noisier. I know.
Ivy's little sister caught the flu bug that's going around,
so Jon's home with her and Link.
They tell you in those counseling sessions
not to get your hopes up. Do you really think --
I saw the report on the heart,
and I have a very good feeling.
Yay.
Yay!
Yay!
Crap.
Crap. I know.
Hey, what's wrong?
A donor heart just showed up for my cardiomyopathy kid.
Help me out with why that's bad.
It's just bad timing.
Today's day 30 of recovery
for our conduit trial patients --
The last day for our report to the N.I.H.,
which will inform your Harper Avery consideration.
I -- you said that. I didn't. But yes.
I plan on spending all day with the conduit kids
to ensure we end up with the most optimal results.
And instead, you have to save the life of a little girl.
That sucks.
Oh, I know.
Oh, you're being facetious.
Yeah.
He's right.
And it would be nice to get back into the O.R., won't it?
Oh, no.
Yes. You stay with the trial patients.
Keep them safe and warm.
Today's numbers have got to be the best they've ever been.
There are nurses that can --
Shane, there's a bug going around this hospital.
If one of those patients' conduits gets infected,
the trial dies.
I'll join you when I'm done.
This trial is my baby, Shane.
Don't let my baby die.
Poor guy conked out.
Hey, champ. Doctor's here.
Hey, Braden, you feeling any better?
I don't know. Still a little stuffy.
But...yeah, maybe a little better.
Okay, Braden, we're gonna move you
to someplace a little more comfy, okay?
We need to move my patient into isolation right now.
So every time you go into Braden's room,
you will put on a fresh gown, gloves, and mask.
Right. Every time. Yeah.
The lump on Braden's head is a rapidly growing infection.
We just want to make sure he doesn't get any more.
But he's been taking the enzyme.
It's supposed to stop this kind of thing from happening.
His labs show his T-cell count is zero,
which means he's developed antibodies to the enzyme
and it's no longer working.
He's highly susceptible to all types of infection.
Have you considered a bone-marrow transplant?
We tried to find the match right after he was born,
but ethnic donors are so hard to find.
They recommended the enzyme instead.
It's been working.
It was working.
You ready?
I'm ready.
Hey, champ. Brady bug!
Hi, sweetie. Ohh.
Mom.
Ohh. Baby.
Yeah, this is a U.S. Project, but I believe our --
our best approach is to open our doors
to welcome your participation.
You know, we're trying to gain a comprehensive understanding
of the most complex object in the world -- our brain.
We are willing to take every great mind
we can access to do it -- your minds.
We welcome you.
Thank you for joining us.
That was great. You did a good job.
I went up to daycare to find my son missing.
Yeah, I needed an audience. Look, sit down.
Let me go over this again with you, okay?
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard that speech so many times I could do it myself.
Stop boring our son.
Is it boring?
I have 50 scientists
from around the world coming here today.
It's got to be charming. It's a big deal.
I know it's a big deal,
which is why I will get out of your way.
And I'm taking my son with me because
I don't want his first word to be hypothalamus.
There are worse first words.
Thank you.
Good news.
The heart checked out okay and is en route.
Time to go to the O.R.
Thank god.
Mom, you'll call dad?
Tell him to e-mail Mr. Moss
and get the application for student council.
Sign-ups have already been out for a week.
Mom?
Just give me a kiss first.
I'm gonna be right here when you wake up, okay?
I love you.
When we're finished with the surgery,
I'll come update you.
Okay, thank you.
Hey.
Yeah, they just took her up.
How's Frankie?
Yeah, I'm okay...
Sort of.
Yeah, I wish you were here, too.
Okay.
Whoo, hey.
I'm gonna need you to get Sofia to school in the morning
'cause I'm gonna be home sick.
This again.
No, no, this is her superpower.
She looks fine now, but -- - she is fine.
No, I'm thinking it's gonna be about three days.
So you know what?
You should cancel dinner with Pam and them, too.
Oh, no, can you call?
I-I don't even have a resident today,
and everyone's out with the plague, so...
Speaking of canceling,
are you sure Dr. Butthole's gonna be here?
He's already late.
Dr. Butthole has arrived.
I get that a lot.
Also, Dr. Poop Chute, Dr. Rear Gear, Dr. Rump Chump.
But my favorite -- the Sphincter Fairy.
My friends call me Oliver,
and you look radiant, as always.
Oh, it's really nice to see you, Ollie.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't -- I-I-I wasn't --
Oh, no offense taken.
I'll just cry myself to sleep tonight
on my piles and piles of money.
We ready?
Yes. Let's go.
Hey, Braden Morris is here?
He was my patient a few years ago.
What's going on?
His meds stopped working.
He's got acute frontal sinusitis.
It's spreading fast.
Well, it's a potts puffy tumor.
He should get to surgery right away, get it drained.
Make sure it doesn't spread and --
You look horrible.
Yeah, correct. You look horrible.
What's going on with you?
Oh, nothing.
It's -- my stomach's a little screwy. I'm fine.
Gonna, um, go book an O.R., though.
No, you're not.
The best thing you can do for this kid
is to be nowhere near him.
Because you look horrible.
Yeah, I can drain a potts puffy tumor.
Go home.
Yeah, you should go home.
You need to -- - I'm fine.
Okay? I can take care of myself.
Maybe I will.
Yes, you should go home,
put on some good, fluffy socks.
Oh, there's soup in the pantry,
and just go get in the shower and sit in it to --
April! I know how to be sick.
I'm not even sick.
Just trying to help him.
Well, let's go help him.
Mr. Gorder, your labs look great and your EKG is clear,
so we're gonna be sending you
up to the O.R. in a little bit, okay?
Yeah, sounds good.
Uh, nervous?
A little bit, yeah.
How about if Dr. Murphy
takes you through the procedure one more time?
Murphy?
Uh, she might be asleep.
She's not asleep.
Yeah, no, no.
I...was just going over your case in my head,
and now I'll go over it with you.
You have a walled-off abcess.
So we'll clean out the puss
and, um, resect a portion of your bowel.
And I'll still be able to poop just fine?
Yes, sir.
That's the plan.
Just call all the colleges.
See if anybody there can speak it.
Right away, Dr. Shepherd.
Are you okay?
Uh, if you can speak Estonian.
My translator called in sick.
You don't look good. Are you getting this thing?
I don't get sick. It's an unspoken rule.
Spoken. Twice today.
Yeah, well, even if I were gonna get sick,
it's not gonna happen today.
Murphy, you look awful.
I'm pushing through.
You know, get away from me.
Oh, wow. He's here.
Who's here?
He came.
Is that Gerhardt Strauss?
Gerhardt Strauss is coming to your thing?
I told you, Meredith, it's a big deal.
Dr. Derek shepherd.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Dr. Strauss. Pleasure's all mine.
Uh, thank you for coming.
I was, uh, intrigued, Shepherd.
Your project was the talk of the E.U. neuroscience conference.
Mostly, people were wondering whether it was a serious effort
or just a P.R. stunt for your president.
Well, you'll fell more confident after the presentation.
Well, I have no doubt that you will charm and dazzle us.
I just hope that it is not a big, um...
What is the phrase you use?
hype?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Flash over substance?
No, no, no, no, no. Um, uh, com--
Complete waste of my time.
Yes.
I look forward to it.
Oh, good.
Sure you feel okay?
98.9.
You're clear.
Next.
Is this really necessary?
Whoa. 100.7.
I'm sorry. I can't let you in.
That's barely a fever.
Ma'am, your daughter's trying
to heal from her conduit surgery.
We don't want anything to interfere with that, right?
Rest up. Lots of fluids.
Excuse me.
Oh, get away from here.
No, come on. The pit's a hot zone.
If I stay down there, I'm gonna get sick. Come on.
Okay, you should go home.
No, I'm pushing through.
Well, push through somewhere else.
You're too close to my patients.
And you have a sheen.
Oh, are you enjoying that coffee?
Because I did when I took a big sip of it
in the lounge this morning.
You didn't.
Did I?
I don't like this at all.
His abdomen's rigid. He's feverish.
Sir, it's your choice not to accept the tetanus toxoid,
but you should know that full-blown tetanus can kill you.
Your respiratory muscles will spasm.
You won't be able to breathe.
You're a tear-donger!
Here we go.
What did he call me?
A fear-monger.
He thinks big pharma lay on scary statistics
in order to get people to buy in to their poisons.
They do.
I am not big pharma.
I am your doctor, and I'm trying --
You're their hut-hett.
What?!
I am nobody's puppet!
And I'm trying to keep you from getting sicker
than you've already made yourself, so --
Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
Logan, I'm running out of ways of saying, "I told you so."
I got you. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Oh, my God! Ohh, God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You know, they teach Dr. Lebackes' technique
in med school now.
Dr. Robbins, you're making me blush.
Everyone has to have a specialty, right?
And everybody has to poop.
Do you always listen to music like this during surgery?
Anything with a beat.
We spend enough time here at work.
It ought to be fun, right?
And the '80s were nothing if not fun.
Hemoclip!
I know this is old hat for you, Oliver,
but Dr. Karev's never seen this procedure firsthand.
You want to walk him through it?
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Yeah, uh, kill the music, will you?
Uh, no, it's cool.
It looks like you used a posterior sagittal approach,
and then divided the parasagittal fibers in the midline.
I'm guessing you'll open the levator muscle next?
Boy Wonder knows his stuff.
You think I'm the only one with a nickname around here?
All right. Here we go.
You want me to put the entire unit on lockdown...
Yes.
...because of the flu.
Yes.
No.
All due respect, Dr. Yang left me in charge.
That's cute. Listen, I'm in charge of the CCU.
You're in charge of three patients.
Three very important patients who need protection from the --
I'm not done.
You can put your patients in Pod 3,
then you can institute whatever kind of lockdown
makes your little heart sing.
I have no nurses to spare, so you're on your own.
Now I'm done.
You should get that looked at.
Oh, man, that is a nasty break.
You see this?
He has an old fracture that never healed properly.
See how it's mal-aligned?
Left the bone weaker than it should have been.
Wilson?
I think that this is my fault.
The guy was getting to me and I was pissed
and then I was just trying to restrain him and I --
You think you broke his arm?
Wilson, don't flatter yourself.
Tetanus spasms can be so intense.
They've been known to over-torque and snap bones.
He broke his own arm?
But we're not gonna be able to realign the new break
without re-breaking the old fracture.
So you have to break his bone
in order to put it back together again?
No.
I think you do.
I can't do that.
You thought you could a second ago.
What's so wrong with wanting to help somebody?
It's our profession, for God's sake.
Well, if the man doesn't want help...
He's not a goat!
No, he is not.
Boy, is he not.
He doesn't need to separate from the flock
and crawl to the back of the barn
to tough it out by himself.
I want to help.
Then welcome to your next 30 years.
What do you mean?
You're gonna want to help him.
He's going to want to help himself.
Neither of you is going to change.
Get used to this argument.
Might as well just let him suffer?
If that's what he wants,
go get a pedicure and count your blessings.
Look, there's two kinds of man sick --
the Jackson kind and the Ben Warren kind.
Now, when I get home tonight, Dr. Ben Warren
will call out "Miranda" from his fetal position
on the couch and beg me for saltines
and a wet washcloth for his head.
Jackson's crawl-away-like-a-goat kind is the good one.
Oh, God, look.
It's cerebral spinal fluid.
Ohh, the abscess has penetrated into his brain since the C.T.
We're gonna have to call Dr. Shepherd.
Yeah.
Whether you believe, uh,
that this ultrastructural analysis is made of...
...physiological experiment or a computer algorithm,
it's safe to say that we can all agree
that the neuro...circuits are the key to...
thought and...action.
What are you eating?
Uh, onion rings. Do you want some?
Take them outside... of the building.
I do believe that this is --
Dr. Shepherd, you're needed in O.R. 2.
Dr. B -- - I am not on call today.
Nelson is.
Nelson's out sick with the stomach flu.
Then get ahold of, uh -- - Garrison and Anders, too.
You're the only one who's still not sick.
Unless you are.
I don't get sick.
Headache as well.
Sweetie, I said you didn't need to come.
They said it'll be at least another hour.
Frankie's gotten worse.
She's light-headed and really short of breath.
They did an X-ray.
No, Jon, it's just the flu. Look around. Everybody has it.
You should have stayed home. Now Link is gonna get it.
Honey, she was coughing up pink stuff.
Your husband made the right call.
It is more than just flu.
I'm afraid Fancesca has cardiomyopathy.
What?
Wait, that -- that's -- that's what Ivy has.
Dr. Hunt, she went into complete heart block and lost her pulse.
Remove the oxygen mask and ambu her.
Push for enough atropine
and get a transcutaneous pacer on her now.
Right away, doctor.
Ivy's transplant went very well.
She's doing great.
We'll monitor her,
and you can see her as soon as she wakes up.
And Francesca's heart's been stabilized for now,
but we are gonna need to implant a pacemaker as soon as possible.
And she has cardiomyopathy?
That's what the tests show, just like her sister.
How did both of them get this?
It could be a number of things --
uh, viral, genetic, environmental.
Like, there's something in our house making them sick?
Mold or -- - We can't go home.
Ivy just got a new heart and Link --
I suggest we start with a family medical history
and we'll see if there's any pattern
of heart disease in the family,
particularly in younger relatives.
How soon can we start?
What are the odds,
dealing with two cardiomyopathies on the same day?
I know, and you had your trial patients to think about.
But Ross can handle that.
No, I'm saying, "What are the odds?"
presenting at the same age in two sisters.
It's weird, isn't it?
Really weird.
Tell you what, you do the girl's pacemaker stat.
I'll look in to the family history,
and we'll figure it out.
Okay.
98.6.
I have a cough. Feel my glands.
I'm not touching your glands.
I've got to take care of my conduit kids.
Yes! First of all, swap monkey!
I have not fallen,
but those are helpless children in there,
and if I expose them to this bug,
it could set back the research.
Drink some tea and be a man.
I'll take weekend calls for you for a month.
You know, I'd have done it anyway
'cause those are just helpless little children.
It's not a big deal.
My student loans are deferred to after my fellowship.
Which ends really soon!
Alex, based on your current salary,
It's gonna take you 20 years to pay off the full amount!
And that's with a fixed interest rate
and paying twice the monthly minimum.
You wait any longer, it'll amortize! You're --
All right, back off, Scrooge McDuck! I'll be fine.
Your face is Scrooge McDuck!
You ... needs to be worked.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.
Can I just -- can I just take a minute?
I need to cool down.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
That kind of rage is exactly what we're gonna need.
Keep it going.
Scrub! Come on. Hustle.
Hey. Okay, so what did you think?
The surgery was cool, but, uh, I mean,
Lebackes -- you like that guy?
He's ridiculously talented and he runs a really fun O.R.
Yeah, just ask him.
Surgery went very well -- beautifully well.
We're looking at a full recovery,
so no need for a colostomy bag.
Really?
Yeah.
He's a big, strong boy. He's gonna be just fine.
More than just fine.
He's gonna be perfect.
Thank you, Dr.Lebackes.
Thank you so much.
That's the good part. That's the money in there.
It never gets old.
Well, long day, successful surgery.
You know what time it is now?
Time for more surgeries?
Time to unwind.
Karev, do you play golf?
Dear lord in heaven, no! You're not --
No, no, no, no, no!
What?
Dr. Shepherd, don't come in here!
But you paged me.
This child has S.C.I.D.
If you're sick at all, you cannot be in here.
Close that door.
Oh, my god.
Well, see, I'm the only one available.
You got a better idea?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.
What?
Okay, babcock, please.
Here you go, doctor.
And umbilical tape.
This is a huge abscess.
We should hang another unit of blood.
Another liter of saline, please.
Murphy, he's already got a unit of l.R. hanging.
Keep up.
It's not for him.
It's for me.
Murphy, are you on an I.V.?
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm super dehydrated.
And I can't keep anything down.
It's really helping with the dizziness, too.
Maybe you should go home.
Yeah, Murphy, maybe you sh--
No!
No, I have found a way to push through,
And I'm not gonna break the unspoken rule
everyone keeps speaking about.
It's like you say, sir -- unless my presence here
is doing my patient more harm than my absence would,
It's my duty to stay.
Impressive, murphy.
I'm proud of you.
Yay me.
You look really cool.
You don't look ridiculous at all. How do you feel?
I'm fine.
Let's keep working.
Roger, Major Tom.
Commencing countdown.
okay, I'm gonna... take this slow.
All right.
Okay.
Really?
Really.
All right, here.
Hold that there. That.
Now, you got to hit it hard.
This just -- it -- this feels wrong.
No, hey, look, I told you the bone is misaligned,
All right, so we have to complete the break
before we can put it back together.
Oh, my god. Don't be a weenie.
I can't!
Look, you're stronger than you think.
Now just -- - No, I'm stronger than you think.
I've put guys in the hospital before.
Okay, yeah, I know. The guy from O.B.
And two guys before him.
Wow. Okay. Wow.
Look, when I get mad, I get...
I don't trust myself.
That's why I thought I hurt him this morning.
I don't want to do this. I don't want to hurt people.
I want to fix them.
Well, this is the only way to fix him.
And it's an easy fix.
Look, that's the nice thing about ortho.
Most of them are easy fixes,
but they take strength and power that not a lot of people have...
Or the fearlessness.
What's next?
Uh, next.
Next...we drill.
Yes.
How you're doing, Dr. Shepherd?
I'm good.
Just...taking it slow.
Almost... imperceptibly slow.
At this rate, you're not even gonna make your big conference.
Okay, Kepner, step in here.
Denude the sinus of mucosa.
As a trauma surgeon, you need to learn this.
Especially since he's about to ralph in his space suit.
Bailey, shut up.
Okay, Kepner, take the...periosteal elevator.
Yes, sir.
It's a long drive.
Ohh, come on! Ohh!
I'm telling you, you got too much turn in your backswing. Here.
Watch this.
Oliver hits the ball from the tee and...
It's a hole in one!
Nice.
All of this.
And your clinic is nicer than my house.
Yeah. Mine, too.
Actually, I'm kidding.
My house is way better.
And you don't have any more patients or, uh, anything today?
Nah. I like to space things out.
Keep things civilized.
It's one of the perks of having your own practice.
Ohh! Swings, and in the bunker.
I'm in the bunker. You're up.
My partners and I are talking about expanding our practice,
bringing in someone new.
Another tough shot for Alex.
Where are you at with your fellowship?
What? My what?
Have you started thinking about what's next?
Well, I-I-I like where I am.
Sure. Of course.
Robbins is great.
But...the perks here...
Oliver swings.
...are more than just big TVs and fancy offices.
Making more money means being able to donate
more money to do more outreach.
I, uh, started an African exchange program at GSM.
Right. Like that.
I set my own hours.
So I'm taking a month off next spring
so I can go to Mafraq and treat Syrian refugees.
Give it some thought. I think you'd be a good fit.
It's a 250k buy-in, which you'll pay off in two years, tops.
Another two, and I guarantee you'll pay off
all your student loans with cash to spare.
Plus, you, too, could have your name emblazoned
on a fine writing utensil just like this.
Murphy, can you suction out some of that fecal debris?
And while you're at it, this abscess
is going into the retroperitoneal cavity.
Can you suction some of that puss around that necrotic tissue.
Feels good, doesn't it, Murphy?
You know, I remember working a 24-hour shift
through a bout of salmonella in my third year.
Suction, please.
Pork was the culprit.
Bad pork.
It tasted fine, but I remember it being a little...slick.
But a physician doesn't succumb to illness.
She conquers it, right?
Right, Murphy? What's the matter?
Are you not answering because you've thrown up in your mouth?
Back away from the field, murphy.
Yeah, go home.
Good effort, Murphy.
Lightweight.
What a wuss.
Hey, how's it going?
We're advancing the leads now.
So I went through the McNeils' family history.
Nothing specifically indicates that it's genetic.
Something is damaging these kids' hearts.
Hers is enlarged, and her E.F. Is low.
She's gonna wind up on the transplant list.
Well, it's still early for that.
The McNeils have given you consent
to do a biopsy while you're still in there.
Oh, and Murphy apparently just threw up in an O.R.,
So I need to start rescheduling elective procedures.
Oh, it's got to be viral.
Clearly.
She's the eighth surgeon I've had come down with this thing.
No. This...The McNeils.
It's got to be viral myocarditis.
I bet you it is. Bring on the pacing.
All right, we are almost done.
Yes. So don't pee.
Excuse me.
Don't you pee on me.
Dr. Edwards.
Dr. Murphy went home sick
in the middle of an intestinal resection.
Are you available?
Oh, absolutely.
Do you think you can take over these patients?
No.
Oh, hey! Come...oh, all right.
Hey, okay, we had a deal.
I'll tell them you're busy.
No, no, no. No, no. I'm not busy.
I'm not...
We used plates and screws
so that the bone will heal straight.
So his body -- his organically pure,
grass-fed body is full of titanium?
Can I get a list of the materials that you guys used?
The -- the rods?
I don't know, like, anaesthesia and stuff for -- for him?
Uh, well, I don't know.
Um, that could take a while.
I'd have to contact distributors.
Normally, I wouldn't ask this,
But our dad died when we were really young,
and he was done in by corned-beef hash and cigarettes.
And since then, Logan's been obsessed with what he puts in his body.
He's a pain in the ass.
I wish he wouldn't take it so far,
But...that's just how he deals.
I'll do it.
Really?
Sure. No biggie.
Any chance the titanium was locally mined?
Ohh, you're feeling it, aren't you?
The ortho glow.
Thank you.
Ohh, is that what this is?
Ohh, you know, I can be fairly turbulent myself.
Yeah, I've had my share of things to get angry about.
Ortho's saved me a couple of times.
I get to work my crap out and someone else
is healed in the process and I get paid.
It's a win-win-win.
Right now I feel like I might never get angry again.
Oh, sweetie. You date Alex Karev.
You always have a reason to be angry.
Hey, where have you been?
You've got five kids to discharge.
This place is disgusting.
Aren't you supposed to be, uh, sick by now?
Oh, crap. I'm losing my touch.
It was my superpower. And now I've lost it.
How much money do you make?
Excuse me?
I mean, as an attending here. What's your salary?
I'm not answering that.
Why, because you're ashamed?
No, because it's classless!
And you should be ashamed, you hobo.
Look, just tell me.
No, get to work, Alex.
Oh, God.
Okay.
You can't do this.
If I can do surgery, I can stand and talk to people.
I have to.
It's not worth it.
See, you've never really been on board with this whole project.
No, Derek, at some point, you have to ask yourself
is your presence here going to do more harm than good?
Trust me.
You're better off calling this thing off
than to get up on that stage and vomit...or worse.
Meredith, I have no choice. This is what we do.
We push through.
Okay?
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no.
Dr. Shepherd, don't get up.
You're dehydrated. You have I.V. phenergan.
I don't want you to pull out your I.V.
I'm...
Here you go, Dr. Shepherd.
Ohh. Here you go.
You're not even warm!
I do feel much better.
I have been changing diapers,
restarting I.V.s, getting peed on.
I missed out on a surgery 'cause you're up here
sleeping off your imaginary illness.
Are the kids okay? Did any of them get sick?
No. They're fine.
You won't be.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Seriously.
You're welcome.
Ross.
How are the conduit patients?
Uh, they're great.
Great numbers, no problems.
Perfect day 30.
Good.
Well, I'll see you upstairs.
We'll get started on the report.
So you're ju--
All your weekend calls,
and I'm your swap monkey for two months.
It's just exciting.
You know, you meet someone and there's just...
a connection.
Oh, we just clicked.
She's just -- oh, I don't know.
She just -- she gets it. She gets me.
And there's still every chance that it might not work out.
I mean, only something like
4% of ortho surgeons are women.
But that's also why it would be so cool.
Callie.
Yeah?
Oh! My god. Did you fall?
No, no, no.
The floor is just really nice and cool.
And this is my friend.
But guess what.
What?
I've still got it.
My superpowers are intact.
Super.
How long will he have to be like this?
Well, at least until the immediate infection is over.
After that is hard to say.
How is he gonna heal if he's stressed out,
if he can't even be comfortable?
We'll have to trust that the multitude
of antibiotics will do their jobs.
If his immunity doesn't come back up,
it's very possible that he'll need to be
in some sort of isolation for the rest of his life.
The rest of his life?
Baby!
Mom! Dad!
We love you, champ!
We're right here for you, buddy.
Don't be scared.
We're not going anywhere.
We're right here.
Mom.
We're right here, Braden.
Champ, it's okay.
Don't worry.
We're never gonna leave you. Okay?
We love you.
It's a known fact
that doctors make the worst patients.
You okay?
I brought you some hot soup.
Hello?
Get out.
Okay, all right. Okay.
*I've done all right up till now*
*It's the light of day that shows me how*
*When the night falls*
*Loneliness calls*
I'm here if you need anything, okay?
Okay.
*Oh, I wanna dance with somebody*
We ignore our symptoms
...until we're facedown on the ground.
You actually dug my crap out of the trash.
There's like 85 jokes I could make right now.
Go ahead, chuckles. Make your jokes.
But sit down and pay your bills.
Why do you even care?
I know that you would rather just shove stuff aside,
out of sight, out of mind,
but the longer you wait, the worse you make it.
Look at your dad.
You avoided him for years,
and when you finally had to deal with him,
it was torture.
But you dealt with him.
And there's no way you can tell me
that you don't feel better.
It's that easy, huh?
Yeah.
It's an easy fix.
And easy fixes are just so satisfying.
I may have figured out an easier one.
We like to think
we're a different species than our patients.
I missed it.
You did.
Are they all gone?
Gerhardt Strauss?
Were they pissed?
No, actually, it went pretty well.
They all seemed sold.
Except for the Estonian guy. He was lost.
Wait. What happened?
Look. Good evening.
Dr. Shepherd welcomes you all
and regrets that he couldn't be here with you tonight.
He has taken suddenly, and very disgustingly...
...ill.
I told you -- I've heard it enough times.
So I am the wife.
You did my speech.
And I'm here in his stead.
Well...
When my husband was first approached
about this project, I was not on board.
I kind of did my speech.
Oh, my god. - It would take time and energy --
time away from our family,
our marriage, my work...
his work.
But as I soon realized, as you will tonight...
...that this is a vital and momentous opportunity.
It is worth every minute of your precious time.
So let's get started.
Everyone knows someone
who has suffered from a brain disorder.
But none of us are invincible.
Oh, this is bad.
I'm going home.
Oh, god.
And we'll have Dr. Yang come and explain it.
Francesca's pacemaker is functioning well,
and I reviewed Ivy's post-op echo
and saw no signs of graft failure.
Now the bad news?
Unfortunately,
the biopsy did not show a viral cause.
So what's causing this?
We'd like to run more tests.
Maybe even have someone
evaluate your home for other exposures.
We have no idea.
We don't know what's causing their hearts to fail.
But the good news is we caught it,
and we're treating it.
Eventually, we have to face
the fact that we're human...
I'm not sick. I'm okay.
...and that sometimes...
even the mightiest of us need help.
