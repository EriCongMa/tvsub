okay , your brother &apos;s lunch is packed .
you &apos;re buying your own lunch .
luke , alex , come on . let &apos;s go .
there he is . last chance for the summer handshake .
dad .
come on . we &apos;re only halfway done .
i need help .
i was supposed to keep a journal all summer . it &apos;s due today .
wow , first day of school and you &apos;re already behind ?
i &apos;m dead .
all right . tell me how far you &apos;ve gotten .
okay .
&quot; june 21 . found a stick . &quot;
&quot; june 22 . &quot; that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it ?
it was a really cool stick .
he &apos;s right . it looked like a snake .
getting everybody out of the house in the morning
can be really tough ,
especially the first day of school .
from the minute we get up at 7 : 00
till we drop &apos; em off at school , it is go , go , go .
i get up at 6 : 00 .
i get up at 5 : 00 .
seriously . i get up at 6 : 00 .
that &apos;s you ? i thought we had a raccoon .
i can &apos;t believe my little boy is going into the fifth grade .
he used to hold my finger with his little hand
and look at me with those big eyes .
mi nio pequeo , jay .
yup , they grow up .
come on , manny . let &apos;s get going .
how &apos;s my hair ?
hold on . what are you wearing there ?
that looks like an old christmas tree skirt .
it &apos;s a traditional colombian poncho .
i want my new classmates to know
i &apos;m proud of my heritage .
i think you look very handsome . lindo .
oh , really ? am i driving him to school
or is he gonna ride his burro ?
* you are a cutie pie , yes , you are *
* you are a cutie pie *
are you still baby @-@ proofing ?
everything we own is pointy .
why is our daughter dressed like donna summer ?
she is not donna summer .
clearly she &apos;s diana ross from the r.c.a. years .
how is daddy not seeing that ?
i really thought you were done with this .
i made no such promises .
i guess i &apos;m somewhat of a shutterbug .
yes .
and my new favorite model , of course , is lily .
i just completed a series of photographs
of her dressed as various pop icons .
let &apos;s see .
i &apos;ve done olivia newton @-@ john .
i &apos;ve done madonna , the early years ,
stevie wonder-
yeah , there are days when lily has more costume changes than cher .
cher ! how could i forget cher ?
that &apos;s embarrassing .
that &apos;s embarrassing ?
第一季第六集
honey , you moving out ?
five more years .
a little help here ?
this is why we suggested the violin .
a cello is more in demand in university orchestras .
you know what &apos;s not in demand ?
oh , what ?
girls who play in university orchestras .
here , i &apos;ll help you carry it out to the curb .
okay . here .
phil , put on some pants .
come on ! this covers up more than my bathing suit .
and don &apos;t remind me .
haley , honey-
don &apos;t forget , the driving instructor is picking you up from school .
can &apos;t he pick me up someplace else ?
i don &apos;t want kids at school thinking i &apos;m dating ...
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old driving instructor who &apos;s not even cute .
haley just got her learner &apos;s permit .
we &apos;ve been taking turns driving with her .
one of the really standard rules of the road ...
is we want to keep a safe distance
between us and the car in front .
and that is not safe right there . not safe .
right .
okay , merge .
i-
merge . merge ! merge ! merge ! merge !
stop it ! you &apos;re freaking me out !
this navigation system is all messed up .
it thinks we &apos;re in a park .
oh , my god ! it is a park !
away from the kids !
oh , my god !
aim for the lake !
i wanted-
makes you realize we &apos;re all just hanging by a thread .
the last thing manny needs on his first day of school ...
is you &quot; undermelting &quot; his confidence .
undermining .
now you &apos;re doing it to me too .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but there &apos;s only two places anyone should wear a poncho-
niagara falls and log rides .
you think too much about these things .
i wear all sort of daring outfits all the time ,
and people admire them because i wear them with the confidence .
yeah , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the confidence they &apos;re admiring .
i just- i just think it &apos;s a little over @-@ the @-@ top .
you know what ? you need to loosen up and have fun .
i am loose . i &apos;m fun .
remember , uh , breakfast for dinner last week ?
my idea .
ever since we brought lily home , you &apos;ve been tense .
all you do is put child locks on things , read parenting books .
would you please stop and- here , just hold your daughter .
hold her and relax .
all right , sweetheart , come on .
just relax .
aw , sweetheart .
did you put hair spray on this ?
just a little bit . i &apos;m gonna put some music on .
no , cam , i have to go to work .
dance with her .
come on , it &apos;s not time for this .
put a little boogie in it .
oh , come on .
just dance . you know you love this song .
this is actually a really good song .
all right . okay .
who &apos;s a dancing queen , huh ?
put a little boogie in it .
see ? fun , right ?
oh , my- was that her head ?
no , i think if it was her head , she would be-
yeah , it was her head . okay . okay .
yes . yes , i know .
i got boo @-@ boo bear from the freezer .
why do you have chocolate on your face ?
it was under a pie .
so you ate your way to it ?
i made a judgment call . you weren &apos;t there .
do you think she &apos;s all right ?
she didn &apos;t cry that much .
maybe that &apos;s a bad sign . you know ,
we should try and make her laugh .
why ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s how we &apos;ll know she &apos;s okay .
where &apos;s ... uh ... where &apos;s doggy ?
doggy . doggy . here , doggy .
okay . there you go .
but it &apos;s a dog .
yeah , i know . that &apos;s why it &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s as funny as you think it is .
can we please just call your sister ?
no , no . cam- cam- - why ?
so she can be all judgmental and condescending ,
like she &apos;s the expert and
i don &apos;t know how to take care of a baby ?
mitchell , she is your family .
of course she &apos;s gonna be judgmental and condescending .
hello ?
hey , hi , um- not a big deal . just wondering .
when your kids were small , did you ever-
i don &apos;t know- smack their heads into a wall ?
usually we just gave time @-@ outs .
no , no , accidentally .
um , we just kind of bonked lily &apos;s head .
it wasn &apos;t very hard and she &apos;s not acting any differently ,
but i just worry-
relax . it happens .
luke used to bang his head all the time and he &apos;s fine .
okay , all right , thank you . thanks . that helps . okay , okay .
we gotta take her to the doctor . load up the car .
gloria ?
i &apos;m here .
i , uh , just dropped manny off at school , and i realized ...
i just dropped manny off at school .
oh , boy .
and i was hoping we &apos;d still have a few more good years
before the mind started to go .
no , what i &apos;m saying ,
we have the day to ourselves , the first time in months .
we should take advantage of it .
go to the club ,
nice lunch ,
some massages .
what about work ?
i &apos;m the boss .
since i married you , people are surprised i come in at all .
jay &apos;s very spontaneous .
he &apos;s always surprising me with little presents , fun getaways .
i wasn &apos;t the greatest husband the first time around ,
but i &apos;m trying to do better this time .
and maybe by my third marriage , i &apos;ll have it down pat .
yeah , that one &apos;s gonna cost me .
what ya reading there ? a book ?
yeah . i &apos;ve been meaning to get to it for a while .
ooh , it &apos;s got a map at the beginning .
i like it when books do that .
don &apos;t you have an open house this morning ?
i rescheduled .
thought you might like some company .
well , the first day of school can be tough
for stay @-@ at @-@ home moms .
now , you have to understand ,
the kids are gone , the nest is empty .
they are rudderless .
and a lot of guys wouldn &apos;t even notice ,
but i &apos;m not a lot of guys .
i listen with my mind ,
and if you pay attention , women will tell you what they want ...
by telling you the opposite of what they want .
like the other day , claire was , like , &quot; you have to move your car .
there &apos;s no space in the garage for both of our cars . &quot;
and what she &apos;s really saying is that ,
you know , i should probably get a sports car .
i was sort of looking forward to a quiet day .
thought i &apos;d just read , maybe go for a run later , that &apos;s it .
great . we &apos;ll run together .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i know .
listening .
the thing is , i like to run alone .
and i run kinda fast , so-
so ?
so i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re gonna be able to keep up with me .
you &apos;re kid- you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no .
you really think i can &apos;t keep up with you ?
i &apos;m not sure you can keep up with this conversation .
i think you &apos;re forgetting that i power @-@ walk every morning ...
and that i wear my special shoes with the big soles ,
which were designed by a doctor .
yes , i know . but i run every day .
you really think you can run as fast as me ?
no , phil , i think i can run much , much faster ...
than you .
boom . just like that , the whole day changed .
it was game on . she knew it .
i knew it . we both knew it .
i just wanna read .
i think i &apos;ii order what i had the last time .
what was that called ?
you want me to say it
because you want me to roll my r &apos;s .
come on !
reuben .
jay , what is this ?
oh , looks like my old car cover .
don &apos;t give me that . this is manny &apos;s poncho .
what is it doing here ?
maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school .
what did you say to him ?
nothing . i ... told some jokes .
you say plenty with your jokes .
jay , he looks up to you .
he respects your opinion .
we dodged a bullet on this .
trust me . i &apos;ve been down this road before .
i remember one time mitchell
decided to wear a jaunty scarf to school .
i kept my mouth shut .
he got his jaunty butt kicked .
my dad has this perception that i was very flamboyant as a kid ,
which is just- it &apos;s nonsense ,
because i kept the whole gay thing very under wraps .
you know , i was just a guy &apos;s guy .
i was basically a jock .
you know ?
so we should crush manny &apos;s spirit ...
and destroy everything that makes him who he is .
i &apos;m just saying ,
it &apos;s no fun to see your kid get picked on every day ,
getting tormented just because he &apos;s different .
now i &apos;m telling you , it rips your heart out .
well , batman doesn &apos;t get picked on and he wears a cape .
a poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around .
batman doesn &apos;t get picked on because he &apos;s a muscular genius .
manny can &apos;t make it to the top bunk .
we &apos;re taking this poncho to manny at school .
it &apos;s important that he knows we support him .
and then we go get those massages , because that sounds good .
i always take the stairs two at a time .
i don &apos;t even think about it anymore .
the regular way would seem weird .
phil , let it go . i &apos;m faster than you .
if only there was some way we could settle this once and for all .
but how ?
you seriously wanna race me ?
i ran a half @-@ marathon last year .
wow . i &apos;m half @-@ scared .
okay , we do need to do this . i &apos;ll go change .
not now . i got a conference call . but how about after that ?
great . this afternoon .
sweet .
two at a time , two at a ti-
son of a- gotta fix that step !
two at a time ! already at the top , so-
hi , i &apos;m dr. miura . i &apos;m on call today .
looks like we have a little head bump .
yeah , it happened a couple hours ago on a- on a doorjamb .
we used to do this thing in school ...
where they would give you an egg and you couldn &apos;t break it .
and it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent .
but the real thing ,
i @-@ it &apos;s so much harder . you know ?
we did that in my school too .
didn &apos;t turn out so well .
i went through a dozen eggs .
yeah , well , he &apos;s a nervous eater .
no , i broke a dozen eggs .
i &apos;m sorry . i just assumed that-
i know .
i know what you assumed .
there doesn &apos;t seem to be any mark .
well , her head was somewhat protected .
protected ?
was she wearing a @-@ a hat ?
yes , yes , like a hat .
it was a wig , actually . sort of a ghetto @-@ fabulous afro thing .
i thought it might be medically relevant .
really ?
you thought &quot; ghetto @-@ fabulous &quot; might be medically relevant ?
maybe i should just finish with the exam .
yes , thanks .
you &apos;ll be pleased to know that mitchell and i intend on
raising lily with influences from her asian heritage .
that is fantastic .
have you noticed any vomiting since the head bump ?
uh , no . no , no , no .
we &apos;ve hung some art in her room . some asian art .
and then when she &apos;s ready for solid food ,
there &apos;s a fantastic pho place ...
right around the corner from our house .
am i pronouncing that right ? is it pho ?
it &apos;s a soup .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m from denver .
we don &apos;t have a lot of pho there .
uh , just to be sure ,
could you show me how hard lily got hit ?
and use your head .
um , yeah . really , it was- it was just sorta , like , uh-
you know ?
could i see that again ?
um , it was just- just a head bump , you know .
how are you feeling ?
uh , fine .
so is lily .
babies are designed to survive new parents ,
so stop worrying .
you guys are doing great .
thank you .
denver .
i don &apos;t see any ponchos ,
which means either the kids don &apos;t wear them
or the ones who do wear them disappear .
we &apos;re doing the right thing .
i support manny no matter what .
children need to know that you believe in them .
it &apos;s the most important thing .
if you tell them they have wings ,
they will believe they can fly .
oh , really ?
i had a buddy , went to woodstock ,
believed he could fly . didn &apos;t end great .
it &apos;s why hotel windows don &apos;t open anymore .
is something wrong ? who &apos;s died ?
no one , manny .
why would you even think that ?
in colombia ,
manny went to pablo escobar elementary school .
if you were pulled out of class ,
it was definitely to identify a body .
well , we got your poncho here .
i thought you said it made me look like
my neck was wearing a dress .
that was a joke .
oh , good ! it &apos;s still in the pocket !
what do you got there , buddy ?
my pan flute .
i &apos;m going to play some colombian folk music for my new classmates .
huh . great .
i have never been more proud of you .
i &apos;m sure your friends are gonna love it .
break the flute .
what ?
the poncho by itself is fine .
the poncho , plus the flute ,
plus the stupid dance-
my son will die a virgin .
that &apos;s right .
hey , sport , can i take a look at that whistle ?
oh , geez . look at that .
and now you stepped on it !
what ?
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
here , let me get it .
thank you .
you know , actually , maybe you should do this .
why ?
i don &apos;t want to bump her head against the door ,
you know , pinch her with the seat belt .
mitchell , how long are you gonna beat
yourself up over one mistake ?
is this going to be like the blond highlights all over again ?
i just- i think i suck at being a father .
what are you talking about ? we &apos;re new at this .
yeah , but you &apos;re such a natural . i mean , look at you .
you walk into the room and she lights up .
y @-@ you change her diaper with one hand . i-
nice . i @-@ i &apos;m actually jealous of you .
there are so many things that you do that i can &apos;t .
y @-@ you baby @-@ proofed the entire house .
you took care of all the adoption paperwork .
without you , we wouldn &apos;t even have a baby to injure .
just a couple of forms .
actually , that was a lot of paperwork .
and you got her on all those preschool waiting lists .
can &apos;t believe you were gonna wait until she was &quot; old enough . &quot;
you see , that &apos;s what makes us a great team .
we each have our own strengths .
now , who are amazing parents ?
we are .
i can &apos;t hear you .
we are !
don &apos;t you forget it .
okay .
did we just lock our baby in the car ?
did you put the keys in the bag ?
i put the keys in the bag .
oh , mitchell ,
i told you not to put the keys in the bag !
come on ! don &apos;t freak out !
lily , it &apos;s okay !
* a @-@ b @-@ c @-@ d @-@ e @-@ f- *
what , are you singing to her ?
people get arrested for this , mitchell .
* h @-@ i @-@ j @-@ k @-@ l @-@ m @-@ n @-@ o @-@ p *
do all four doors lock ?
do you have a phone ?
what ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
couldn &apos;t hear ya . i &apos;m cranking one of my mash @-@ ups .
there they are .
how was the first day back in prison ?
fine .
yep
what are you guys doing ?
your mom and i are racing
to the mailbox on sequoia and back .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , she knows .
hey , buddy . soon as i &apos;m done kicking a little mom butt here ,
how about i school you in some mario kart ?
can &apos;t . gotta work on my journal .
lame !
hey , uh , alex . you ?
uh , i have a history paper .
well , if you wanna see a little history being made right here-
not really .
okay .
ready ?
are you ?
i was born ready .
i came outta the womb wearing tiny little golden wings-
go !
i &apos;m breaking the window !
emergency assistance . this is trina .
help ! we i- we locked our baby in the car
and people are judging us !
i swear to god , i &apos;m gonna break it !
do not break the window ! you &apos;ll get glass on her !
sir , please tell your wife to relax .
everything is going to be okay .
that &apos;s a man .
really ?
don &apos;t worry , lily ! daddy &apos;s coming for you !
sir , we just sent the signal .
the door should be unlocked now .
check- check the door .
check the door . check the door .
it &apos;s not unlocked !
okay .
that is amazing . how did they do that ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just- we got it .
thank you .
did that come from space ?
i run five miles a day .
i have a resting heart rate of 48 .
there is no way i &apos;m going to lose
a two @-@ mile race to johnny ski pole .
saving my energy , drafting off of you .
you feeling cocky ?
yeah , i am .
love it .
but after seeing that t @-@ shirt , i realized something .
the first day of school is tough on all my kids ,
especially the one i married .
afterburners engaged !
whoo ! don &apos;t choke on my smoke !
and down the stretch he goes .
i don &apos;t believe it !
daddy wins ! do you believe in miracles ?
u.s.a. , u.s. -
oh , no !
oh , jesus !
oh , my- what was that ?
was that a person ?
i &apos;m good !
dad ?
i &apos;m good .
honey , are you okay ?
i &apos;m good . whoo !
you &apos;re getting better , sweetheart .
did i lose the race to make him feel better ?
maybe .
but it just seemed like he could use a win today .
we do strange things for the people we love .
we lie to them , we lie for them .
there may be some bumps along the way ,
but we never stop wanting the best for them .
that &apos;s what makes it such a tough job .
kind of the best job in the world .
what are you doing ?
turn your eyes on the road !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
okay .
okay .
all right , sweetie , this happens .
remain calm . that &apos;s the first thing .
pull over right here . i &apos;ll get out the registration .
mom , i don &apos;t like cops .
ok , pull over right there .
i don &apos;t like cops .
all right , there &apos;s a space right here ...
i can &apos;t pull over . no , i can &apos;t .
you need to pull over !
no can do . no can do !
phil !
i got priors .
i &apos;m speeding up .
phil , you-
parking ticket from the mall .
i never paid the parking ticket .
keep moving , sweetheart .
dad &apos;s with me , i can speed up and-
it &apos;s not a movie , hayley , and pull over !
