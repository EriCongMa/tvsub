i want to work with you . come to pearson specter .
if all you want to do is work with me ,
i can find a job somewhere else .
scottie , that &apos;s not all i want .
then say it .
i want you in my life .
it &apos;s over , mike . i &apos;m onto you .
and i &apos;m going to expose you
for the lying piece of filth that you are .
louis , i went to harvard .
i just changed my grade .
you cheated ,
and now you &apos;re looking at me to help you get away with it .
no , louis--
get out of my sight .
louis , he did it so that he can practice
the thing that we all love .
and if you don &apos;t let it go ,
he &apos;s never gonna be able to practice it again .
you make mike confess ,
you might as well throw his life down the toilet .
you said we &apos;re friends .
a friend would not ask me to do this .
no , louis .
a friend just won &apos;t hold it against you
if you don &apos;t .
where did you race off to so quickly this morning ?
i went to see my mistress .
mm @-@ hmm , and what &apos;s her name ?
felony .
really ?
and how would you feel if i said the same thing to you ?
it depends . is she hot ?
mm @-@ hmm , you realize
you &apos;re just digging yourself in deeper now , don &apos;t you ?
well , then it &apos;s good that i was really out getting you ...
this .
minnie mouse .
i got a copy from your dad .
i thought it would complement panda .
it &apos;s perfect .
good , because i have a new lease on life .
and i wouldn &apos;t if it weren &apos;t for you .
i am not the only one
who helped convince louis to let it go .
i know .
so are you gonna get something for harvey ?
i want to , but what do you get
the man who has everything ?
the same thing you got me .
a picture of him dressed as a mouse ?
no .
something money can &apos;t buy .
what do you need ?
advice .
that tie has got to go .
i &apos;ve been wanting to say something for months .
it &apos;s not about the tie , is it ?
you know it &apos;s not about the tie .
you &apos;re just giving me shit .
we take our opportunities where they present themselves .
now what can donna do for you ?
i need the perfect gift .
who is it ?
rachel ? something personal ,
preferably a picture from her father .
how could you possibly--
jessica ? simple and elegant .
or wild and crazy , the choice is yours .
louis ? oh , god , doesn &apos;t matter .
just get him anything . he &apos;ll cry for days .
what about harvey ?
there is no gift for harvey .
he gets what he wants ,
and he doesn &apos;t want what he doesn &apos;t get .
and my knowing that is the only gift he &apos;ll ever need from me .
donna , ever since i &apos;ve been here ,
every morning , i step off that elevator wondering
if this is going to be my last day .
last week , that day came ,
and harvey said , &quot; not today . &quot;
i ...
i just--i need to get him something
to let him know what that means to me .
okay .
what ?
there is one thing that harvey has been wanting to get
for years , and he hasn &apos;t been able to .
what is it ?
no , it &apos;s too personal .
and i don &apos;t see how you &apos;re going to be able
to make it happen when he couldn &apos;t .
whatever it is , it &apos;ll make the perfect gift .
before we do anything else ,
i &apos;d like to officially welcome our newest senior partner ,
dana scott .
i &apos;d like to thank you all for bringing me in .
and i assure you , i will be hitting the ground running .
well , that &apos;s what we like to hear .
harvey , where do we stand on franklin courier ?
they just announced plans for the acquisition friday .
i &apos;d like to take lead on this one .
i guess the ground has been hit .
it &apos;s yours .
shit . i am so sorry .
i had an incident at logan .
did i miss anything ?
not really .
scottie &apos;s going to be handling the franklin acquisition .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
franklin &apos;s my client . i was five minutes late .
ten minutes , actually .
well , i don &apos;t care if i skipped
the whole goddamn meeting to get a full @-@ body wax .
i landed that company when they were a regional shithole ,
and i don &apos;t need some interloper to--
scottie &apos;s a senior partner , louis .
oh , this is bullshit .
then i guess you &apos;re saying the bylaws are bullshit .
my bylaws are a work of art .
i know .
and the bylaws clearly state that if a senior partner
is more than ten minutes late to a meeting ,
he or she has no standing .
well , that rule doesn &apos;t take into consideration
a partner being late due to reasons beyond his control .
wait . i &apos;m sorry .
&quot; this rule shall not be abridged by any circumstance ,
&quot; including but not limited to family illness ,
&quot; criminal detention , and travel delay .
for without punctuality , we are animals , &quot; right ?
how dare you quote me to me ? this isn &apos;t over .
yes , it is .
they &apos;re still your client , louis ,
but it &apos;s scottie &apos;s transaction .
moving on .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , it &apos;s only the greatest gift you &apos;ve ever received .
better than m.j. &apos; s jersey
from the 63 @-@ point game ?
if this folder had played in that game ,
it would have scored 80 points .
okay , i don &apos;t even know what that means .
neither do i. just open it .
a run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill corporate case .
i don &apos;t get it .
just look at the attorney of record on the other side .
a. eliot stemple .
how did you know ?
i talked to donna . she told me everything .
define &quot; everything . &quot;
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he kicked your ass in moot court
three years running at harvard .
you &apos;re kind of upset about it . it keeps you up at night .
yeah , well , if she told you everything ,
you &apos;d know he &apos;s been ducking me for the past ten years .
harvey , i just told you
this gift is better than m.j. &apos; s jersey .
do you think i &apos;d make that kind of claim
if i couldn &apos;t deliver on it ?
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying
that a. eliot stemple is not ducking you today .
louis , if this is about franklin courier ,
i &apos;ve made my decision .
it &apos;s not .
okay .
then what &apos;s this about ?
it &apos;s about franklin courier .
louis .
jessica , i want to know where i fall in the pecking order
with regard to dana scott .
there is no pecking order .
i don &apos;t look at things that way .
great .
that means i &apos;m behind her because she &apos;s banging harvey .
i &apos;m going to pretend i didn &apos;t just hear that .
well , unfortunately ,
i can &apos;t pretend that you didn &apos;t just screw me over
on behalf of your partner &apos;s girlfriend .
louis , i didn &apos;t screw you over .
your own bylaws did .
and if the shoe were on the other foot
and you &apos;d taken the case from her ,
you &apos;d be sleeping like a baby .
what does that have to do with anything ?
all right , you know what , don &apos;t bother answering that question .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , dana scott is dead to me .
louis ...
did it ever occur to you that these situations
may sometimes be a result of your own doing ?
what on god &apos;s green earth are you talking about ?
you have an opportunity to bond with our newest senior partner
or make a permanent enemy of her .
and i &apos;m saying , in the past ,
you &apos;ve generally chosen the enemy route .
can you give me a specific ?
off the top of my head ?
pemberton , yates , cohen , duffner , ramirez ...
that &apos;s five isolated incidents .
robinson , jenkins , gardner .
okay , okay , fine . what &apos;s your point ?
my point is , if you let this thing go ,
you can change the entire course
of your relationship with scottie ...
and who knows ,
maybe even redefine yourself within the firm .
words to live by .
jessica , you may have just changed my entire outlook on life .
is that a bomb ?
it &apos;s a gift .
you &apos;re giving me a gift after what happened this morning ?
you &apos;re right .
you did poach my client on a technicality .
and worse than that ,
you used my own precious words against me ,
and normally , i &apos;d declare war , but--
but what ?
it &apos;s been pointed out to me that i have certain proclivities
that need to be adjusted .
louis , what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i would like us to be friends .
it &apos;s very sweet .
thank you .
thank you .
so we &apos;re friends ?
friends .
great . give me my files back .
excuse me ?
you accepted my friendship . give me back my case .
uh , sorry , louis . that &apos;s not how it works .
what the hell kind of friend are you ?
i &apos;m a friend who is not going to give you my case
14 seconds after you give me a scarf .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not a scarf .
it &apos;s one of the world &apos;s finest pashminas .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the world &apos;s only pashmina .
you &apos;re not getting this case .
well , then you leave me no choice
but to institute article 19.5 / b.
there is no article 19.5 / b.
there is now .
all new hires must be accompanied to client meetings
by the existing attorney of record .
you son of a bitch .
you just want to start a fight .
excuse me ?
i tried to make friends with you ,
and you just told me to go screw myself .
i am warning you , louis .
this is a fight you do not want .
oh , no , i want it , and i &apos;m gonna win it .
and when i do , you better not go crying to your boyfriend .
well , look who it is ,
the ghost of christmas past ,
harvey reginald specter .
speaking of the past , a. eliot ,
f.d.r. called .
he wants his bowtie back .
oh , if you &apos;d had rebuttals like that ,
maybe you would &apos;ve gotten past me in moot court just once .
trust me , archibald , i &apos;m way past you .
oh , i guess you are . look at you , huh ?
tom ford suit , $ 1,000 hairdo .
what happened to the skirt @-@ chasing degenerate
i knew back at harvard ?
oh , him ?
he &apos;s a name partner at a firm
ten times bigger than yours .
bigger ? sounds like somebody &apos;s trying to compensate
for three huge losses .
or somebody &apos;s living in the past and too afraid
to take me on in the present .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s afraid .
i think you &apos;ve got a little ptsd--
post @-@ traumatic stemple disorder .
why don &apos;t we go head @-@ to @-@ head right now ?
oh , i &apos;d love to .
but unfortunately , my case is up on the docket .
but let &apos;s do this again really soon , okay ?
call me .
ayz technologies versus janus microprocessors .
mike ross for the plaintiff , your honor .
a. eliot stemple for the defense .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
did i forget to put the name of my firm on the complaint ?
i work at pearson specter .
that &apos;s specter , as in harvey reginald specter .
i &apos;m ready to hear pretrial motions .
motion to substitute counsel , your honor .
on what grounds ?
on the grounds that he &apos;s a pussy .
what &apos;s that , mr. specter ?
i was just wondering
if he has a copy of his motion , because we never got one .
not with me , your honor . something suddenly came up .
my niece , she took ill .
well , when your family &apos;s sick , you have to tend to them .
your honor , mr. stemple may not have a copy of his motion ,
but we do have a copy of his family tree .
he has no nieces .
i meant &quot; niece &quot; figuratively .
she is actually my goddaughter .
and what exactly is her name ?
sandra silverstein .
your honor , that &apos;s the same fictitious goddaughter
that &apos;s taken ill every time mr. stemple &apos;s needed a continuance
in the last five years .
sounds serious .
have you tried acupuncture ?
they are completely out of line , your honor .
the only thing out of line is you .
mr. stemple , not only will you not be replacing yourself ,
you &apos;ll be paying the court a $ 2,000 fine .
we got him . the cage match is on .
two men enter , one man leaves .
we don &apos;t have anything yet .
what ?
come on , you need me to try this thing for you too ?
listen to me . this isn &apos;t thunder dome .
i need you to look at every case he &apos;s worked since law school .
relax , harvey . i &apos;m all over it .
you better be , because you don &apos;t know this guy .
i &apos;m telling you , once it sinks in
that there &apos;s no way out of that cage ,
he &apos;s gonna come out swinging .
you wasted a trip . harvey &apos;s gone for the night .
i &apos;m not here to see harvey . i &apos;m here to see you .
please , what i have to say is important .
i &apos;m not interested in what you have to say .
in law school , i had nothing .
nothing .
no friends , no girlfriend , no respect .
the truth is , i was hanging onto not flunking out by a thread .
look at me . i &apos;m not married .
i don &apos;t have children . i &apos;m not particularly successful .
why are you telling me this ?
i have a little piece of glory that i &apos;ve been holding on to ,
and i don &apos;t expect harvey to care about that .
but you &apos;re still first chair .
you can still let me out .
and i thought that maybe you would .
i &apos;ll think about it .
that &apos;s all i can ask for .
except for one thing .
that &apos;s the exact same speech that your plaintiff gave harvey ,
year one .
doesn &apos;t mean it isn &apos;t true .
you think i &apos;m gonna let you play me ?
a man can try .
stemple , you &apos;ve been ducking harvey long enough .
now you &apos;re either gonna win , or you &apos;re gonna lose .
what you &apos;re not gonna do is avoid him anymore .
oh , and you forgot .
i looked up your family tree .
you are married , you do have children ,
and your firm is top tier .
please , i hate my wife , my children are anchors ,
and the only reason i stay at that firm
is to pay for them to leave me alone .
get the hell on the elevator , stemple .
i &apos;m not leaving you in our office .
good call .
eliot stemple , that &apos;s a blast from the past .
you should have seen his smug face
when he realized he couldn &apos;t duck me .
need my help ?
no , i am taking this one all for myself .
harvey , it was three times .
you remember what it did to you ?
yeah , i remember .
but instead of offering help where it isn &apos;t needed ,
you should be focused on louis litt .
after what you did at that meeting ,
he &apos;s going to come at you full @-@ bore .
i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
you picked a fight with him on purpose .
of course i did .
what happened to the whole
&quot; we need to be open and honest &quot; thing ?
i didn &apos;t think we needed to be open and honest
that one plus one equals two .
i get it .
you don &apos;t want to be seen as my girlfriend ,
so you picked a fight with the biggest ,
baddest prisoner in the yard .
i win this ,
i &apos;m the partner that beat louis litt ,
not the partner sleeping with harvey specter .
okay , i respect that .
but louis just did me a huge favor ,
and i don &apos;t want to get caught in the middle of it .
i don &apos;t need you in the middle of it .
good .
although ...
what did you do ?
well , it &apos;s not really what i did .
it &apos;s , um ... what you did .
what did i do ?
louis , what are you doing here ?
hey , i got your email last night .
yeah , about that--
no , no , no .
i was happy to get it ,
happy to do the work .
nothing makes me happier
than to spend all night helping out a friend .
you were up all night ?
caught a power nap between 4 : 30 and 4 : 45 .
i &apos;ll be fine .
well , what &apos;d you come up with ?
per your instructions ,
i went through eight years
of pritchard holdings corporate returns
with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
that &apos;s a remarkably long time frame .
yeah , you ask for four , i give you eight .
it &apos;s what i do .
and i caught every mistake there was to find .
great . file the amended returns .
with any luck ,
jenner pharmaceuticals will be none the wiser .
jenner pharmaceuticals ?
this suit &apos;s against miller trucking .
that &apos;s what i meant , miller trucking .
what are they suing them for ?
trucking ?
god damn it .
you sent that email just to screw with me .
louis , i didn &apos;t send the email .
scottie did .
she used my computer . i didn &apos;t even know .
oh , bullsh . she came running to you .
you played on our friendship .
and just now you had me go on about it
to continue the mockery .
look , i wasn &apos;t mocking you .
i was trying to keep you from finding out .
i thought if you didn &apos;t know ,
no harm would be done .
no , you know what , harm was done .
and if you value this friendship at all ,
you would stay out of it ,
because i &apos;m going to the mattresses
against dana scott .
mattresses ?
have you been watching the godfather ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been trying to come up with some common ground
to expand our friendship-- sue me .
tell me you finished the proposal
for franklin courier .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
i mean i didn &apos;t do it .
what , did your mother die ?
because if she didn &apos;t , you know--
louis , you told me not to .
we &apos;re at war , bennett .
why would i do that ?
i don &apos;t know , but i got a note from you
telling me that you were gonna be the bigger person
and let dana scott handle it .
the bigger person ?
you should &apos;ve known that was not from me .
good morning , louis . great day .
oh , you look a little tired .
i &apos;m not tired . i don &apos;t get tired .
what do you want , dana ?
i &apos;m just dropping this by .
you sent franklin a proposal ?
well , i couldn &apos;t meet them without you ,
so i figured that i would send this over instead .
you did this behind our backs .
i don &apos;t believe in doing things behind people &apos;s backs .
that &apos;s why i c.c. &apos; d you both on this letter .
no , you c.c. &apos; d us ,
so they &apos;d know that it came from you ,
and we had nothing to do with it .
it did come from me ,
and you did have nothing to do with it .
yeah , you want to play it this way , fine .
but if you think you can outsmart me ,
you &apos;re gonna get litt up .
litt the hell up .
litt up ?
litt . oh .
oh , my god , that is so cute .
i &apos;m gonna go make fun of it on my facebook page right now .
thank you .
okay , we &apos;re gonna take this thing apart limb by limb
so that little miss bullshit
wished she &apos;d never heard the name louis litt .
louis , she &apos;s an excellent attorney .
what if we can &apos;t find anything wrong with it ?
we &apos;re not gonna find anything wrong with it .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re gonna take it apart ,
to make something wrong with it .
mr. walker , in october of last year ,
you made a pitch to the chairman of kyoto computers .
how did that pitch go ?
it went amazingly ,
right up until when they told us
there was no way they could actually buy our product .
and why was that ?
because janus threatened to
withhold their microchip
if kyoto did even $ 1 worth of business with us .
and my next @-@ door neighbor says
he saw his next @-@ door neighbor cheating on his wife .
turned out to be nothing but a vindictive lie .
these are sworn affidavits from the ceos of kyoto , griffon ,
and howland all backing up mr. walker &apos;s claim .
this isn &apos;t your next @-@ door neighbor , archibald .
mr. walker , the truth is that we control the market
because our product is better than yours , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it isn &apos;t .
jake , come on . the cameras are on .
we &apos;re all under oath here .
we are ?
he is .
and i have independent analysis
and sworn testimony from other ceos
disputing everything your client just said .
those things aren &apos;t worth the paper they &apos;re printed on .
my point is that you can go to court ,
spend years fighting a battle you may not win ,
or you can take this settlement .
this is actually pretty fair .
more than fair .
the only thing is , he &apos;s trying to get us to sign it ,
so he can use it against us in court .
just like he did last year against micron
and the year before that against suntech .
you &apos;re just a one @-@ trick pony , archibald .
and once you &apos;ve been to the show , it &apos;s not that good .
hmm , you &apos;re a one @-@ trick pony too , reginald .
only my trick doesn &apos;t end with my own client suing me .
this deposition &apos;s over .
what do you mean , it &apos;s over ?
don &apos;t you want mr. walker to know
that you were just sued for malpractice ?
that client dropped that suit .
and before she did , she stated on the record
that she got shafted because you had a personal vendetta
against your opposing counsel .
he likes to pick fights with other lawyers ,
and he doesn &apos;t give a shit what it does to his clients .
okay , that &apos;s a lie .
it is ?
i think you and i both know why he took this case ,
because he lost this case and this case
and this case to me 15 years ago .
go ahead , ask him .
he &apos;s not under oath , but you &apos;ll know if he &apos;s lying .
and these cases , they were all in moot court .
imagine what he &apos;ll bring down on you when the stakes are real .
i can tell you this much ,
it &apos;ll be a hell of a lot more expensive
than that settlement .
stemple , we &apos;re done .
reginald , you did a great job
making it so i couldn &apos;t get out of it ,
but you should have picked a better case to trap me in .
because we both know that my independent analyst
will come up with anything that i want him to say .
did you hear what he just said ?
i sure did .
and if you did , and i did ...
maybe it did .
i already had breakfast , michael .
maybe , but that &apos;s a bag completely filled with bacon .
crispy ?
to quote my friend benjamin ,
&quot; if it &apos;s not crispy , it &apos;s not bacon . &quot;
i don &apos;t deserve it .
benjamin .
michael , i can enhance the sound of a bee
making pollen recorded from a satellite .
how can you possibly know that ?
it &apos;s been done .
but what i can &apos;t do is enhance sounds
that weren &apos;t picked up by a used camcorder ,
because this firm is too cheap to go with my recommendation
of the $ 63,000 zr @-@ x90 .
you didn &apos;t really recommend that , did you ?
it &apos;s also good for making independent films on weekends .
okay , benjamin ,
i need this audio , or we &apos;re screwed on a huge case .
michael , look at these sound waves .
okay .
there &apos;s nothing there .
no , nothing .
and that &apos;s after 12 hours of maximum enhancement on the tape
and six red bulls in me .
whoa , you shouldn &apos;t be having that many red bulls .
i did it for you , michael .
what do we have ?
uh , nothing .
then we go with what we got .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
he &apos;s saying stemple bluffed ,
so now we &apos;re gonna bluff .
what exactly are we talking about here , gentlemen ?
we want access to the raw data from his independent analysis .
and i wish i would &apos;ve had a vasectomy ten years ago .
but raw data is work product , and he has no right to it .
the work product doctrine
is fairly clear on this , mr. specter .
except in cases of misconduct , your honor ,
which is the situation here .
what exactly are you accusing me of ?
at the end of our deposition , mr. stemple basically boasted
that he plans to fix the findings of his analyst .
that is a lie .
i never said anything of the kind .
what you mean to say is
you didn &apos;t think our microphone would pick it up .
so let me get this straight .
they &apos;re doctoring a tape to accuse me of doctoring a report .
mr. stemple , you have a history of lying to me .
so if you &apos;re on that tape
saying anything close to what they &apos;re claiming ,
i &apos;ll not only sanction you , i &apos;ll report you to the bar .
i &apos;ll give them what they want .
i have to admit , when i read 600 million euros ,
i thought it was a typo .
it wasn &apos;t .
baltic freight can get a bottle of riesling
from an alsatian vineyard to a dubai hotel in six hours .
this is a steal .
i agree . the proposal--
most riveting thing i &apos;ve read since fifty shades of grey .
but--
but ,
but the real upside for you is that i ...
we .
not exactly .
structured the deal to avoid u.s. taxes .
by setting up a subsidiary with headquarters in cyprus .
where the rate is only 5.7 % .
wait a second ,
doesn &apos;t that mean they would have to build in cyprus ?
mm @-@ hmm , and i &apos;ve already locked up a developer .
yeah , i see that , the whitner group .
whoa , i &apos;m so sorry . did you just say whitner group ?
right now they &apos;re being investigated
by the ftc for fraud .
what ?
yeah , it was just announced this morning .
well , those are bogus charges concocted by a jealous competitor
who will stop at nothing--
i &apos;m so sorry , tom .
as dana mentioned , i was c.c. &apos; d on this ,
but i didn &apos;t exactly have a chance to vet it .
tom .
our reputation is everything , ms. scott .
we can &apos;t be in bed with criminals .
i will have another proposal over to you within the hour .
thank you , louis .
oh , and , tom , scottie &apos;s new , okay ?
so just cut her some slack .
because when those training wheels pop off ,
she &apos;s gonna be really , really good .
what the hell did you do ?
nothing .
i just called a friend at the ftc .
you made up charges against a company
just to get back at me ?
i did nothing of the kind .
i simply alerted a friend
to some possible misdoings .
these are people .
you are hurting their business .
oh , please , give me a break .
they &apos;re not publicly traded .
they don &apos;t have a stock price that &apos;ll fall .
and if they &apos;re as clean as you say ,
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be exonerated .
but not in time for me to get franklin &apos;s business .
oh , i don &apos;t give a shit when they &apos;re exonerated .
you &apos;re never getting franklin &apos;s business .
you really are a dick .
i &apos;m moby goddamn dick ,
and you just swam in my waters .
per your request , this is everything .
you didn &apos;t just come over here to deliver work product .
i &apos;ve got a revised settlement offer .
and before you say anything ,
it contains a provision prohibiting me from using it against you .
after what happened today ,
you think i &apos;m going to settle ?
please , harvey , just take a look at it .
so now that you need something ,
it &apos;s harvey , not reginald .
settling is what you do .
not with you .
and the reason i &apos;m not gonna settle with you--
i get it .
i ducked you .
look , i could take the losing ,
the gloating , and the taunting .
but what i can &apos;t take is losing to a coward
who &apos;s too afraid to stand up and try to beat me again .
i didn &apos;t beat you the first time .
what the hell are you talking about ?
it was rigged .
i bribed the jury .
what ?
that &apos;s why i keep ducking you .
you &apos;re telling me you cheated all three years ?
once i won ,
i was the guy who beat harvey specter .
there was no going back .
and you think admitting that now is gonna make me settle ?
i &apos;m coming clean because it &apos;s time to put it to bed .
put it to bed ?
you gonna take an ad out in the crims saying you cheated ,
just like you did when you beat me back then ?
harvey .
no , no , i remember it .
muhammad ali standing over sonny liston .
your face on ali ,
mine on liston ,
every day for a week .
you know who my hero was , eliot ?
ali .
that &apos;s right , you piece of shit .
you want to know why i did that ?
because you were an arrogant bastard
who skated through life without a care in the world ,
getting everything you wanted from anyone you needed !
and you know what ,
if i had to do it again ,
i would do the exact same thing .
i &apos;m not settling .
you so much as think about breaking the law on this case ,
i guarantee you &apos;ll end up in jail .
is this--
yes .
with extra--
yes .
to what do i owe this honor ?
dana scott .
no .
hear me out .
you won .
i &apos;m not saying you have to give in to her .
i &apos;m saying , make amends with her .
mm , and why would i want to do that ?
well , it would help if you tried
putting yourself in her shoes .
the same shoes that tried walking away with my client ?
louis , all i &apos;m saying is ,
she came here from darby international
to be harvey &apos;s girlfriend .
i &apos;d say that &apos;s enough baggage
to deserve you cutting her some slack .
but i did cut her some slack , donna .
i bought her the world &apos;s finest pashmina ,
and she wiped her ass with it in return .
okay , i got it .
you &apos;re never gonna like her .
forget i said anything .
wait a second .
did harvey send you here ?
no , louis , he didn &apos;t .
harvey doesn &apos;t care about this .
why do you ?
because i know harvey , i know scottie ,
and i know you .
and if somebody doesn &apos;t back down ,
this isn &apos;t gonna end well .
are you saying that you or harvey
are gonna hold this against me ?
no , louis , i &apos;m not saying that .
good , because then
i &apos;ll tell you what i told him .
if our friendship is dependent on this ,
then we do not have a friendship at all .
it &apos;s not .
i was just trying to help .
mr. morris ,
please tell the court what the raw data indicates
about the two companies &apos; microprocessors .
and i remind you , you &apos;re under oath .
both products operate at the exact same rate .
what you &apos;re saying is ,
our product is just as good as theirs .
i &apos;m saying their performance is identical .
and yet janus dominates the marketplace .
why is that ?
objection . calls for speculation .
oh , i &apos;ll tell you why .
it has nothing to do with product superiority
and everything to do with janus bullying its competitors .
that &apos;s not a question ,
nor is it mr. morris &apos; area of expertise .
no , it isn &apos;t .
bullying is his client &apos;s area of expertise .
no further questions .
mr. morris , you just testified
that the microprocessors &apos; performance was identical .
is it possible that they are actually identical ?
anything &apos;s possible .
how would that be ?
either it &apos;s a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ billion event ,
or one of them stole the other one &apos;s design .
your honor , based on evidence introduced by opposing counsel
and mr. morris &apos; testimony ,
i would like to file a countersuit
against ayz for patent infringement .
that is outrageous .
his client stole my client &apos;s design .
i am the one who is outraged .
this case has nothing to do with patent infringement .
it does now , reginald .
move !
we need to talk .
not now , i &apos;m carbo @-@ loading .
for what ?
for you ! we &apos;re still at war .
no , we &apos;re not .
so what ,
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re waving the white flag ?
no , i am waving this ,
bylaw 19.5 / b ,
in clear violation of 139 / j.
i got ratification per 139j .
there wasn &apos;t a quorum present .
big deal , technical violation .
not for you . you &apos;re on the bylaw committee .
and you know what the bylaws say about a member of the committee
implementing an amendment without approval ?
immediate removal .
so back the hell off my case .
this won &apos;t stand .
louis , i am warning you to not keep pursuing this .
i &apos;ve beaten you before , and i will beat you again .
you &apos;ve never beaten me before .
haven &apos;t i ?
who do you think it was that assigned nigel
to go against you in the dissolution talks ?
meow .
you &apos;re the devil .
no .
i &apos;m not the devil . i &apos;m a strategic thinker .
louis litt , you are hereby notified
that your services are no longer needed
on franklin courier .
and if you go around me ,
i will invoke 139j on your ass .
he set us up .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
he made our client look like a thief .
it &apos;s not true .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s not true .
now we &apos;re on the defensive .
gentlemen , that settlement offer
is about to get flipped on its ass .
and thank you for introducing that evidence ,
&apos;cause it wouldn &apos;t have been as credible coming from me .
you dropped that comment on purpose .
mm @-@ hmm . i knew that camcorder wouldn &apos;t pick it up ,
just like i knew you would bluff to get that data .
you made us work for it , or we would &apos;ve seen it coming .
he would never have seen anything coming
once i fed him that bullshit about bribing the jury .
i &apos;ve got your number , reginald .
i haven &apos;t been ducking you . i &apos;ve just been setting you up .
i took a page from your hero &apos;s playbook ,
rope @-@ a @-@ dope .
i heard about today .
if you hadn &apos;t ,
i &apos;m sure there &apos;ll be an ad about it in the paper tomorrow .
what ?
stemple says he &apos;s got my number , and it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
what are our options ?
for all i know , this deal &apos;s the best i &apos;m ever going to get .
stemple &apos;s been outthinking me ever since i met him .
you &apos;re the only other person who &apos;s ever done that .
i need your help .
have i ever told you about my high school tennis career ?
i didn &apos;t even know you played .
i was 38 and 3 .
you know who handed me every one of those losses ?
eliot stemple ?
marsha myers .
a 5 @-@ foot @-@ nothing math geek
with a 20 @-@ mile @-@ an @-@ hour serve .
i should have left a marsha myers skid mark
on the court and never looked back .
but instead , the little bitch was a human backboard .
and i think about it to this day .
you &apos;re saying i should take the deal
because i can &apos;t beat him ?
i &apos;m saying i know what it &apos;s like
to have an eliot stemple .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a question ,
and i want you to give me an instant response .
do you want to beat him , or do you want to settle ?
i want to leave an eliot stemple skid mark .
then there &apos;s your answer .
if he &apos;s got your number ,
then what you want to do is what he wants you to do .
harvey , i &apos;ve been looking at stemple &apos;s cases .
doesn &apos;t matter .
what do you mean it doesn &apos;t matter ?
we &apos;re taking the settlement .
you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
jessica has a plan .
fighting is stepping into a trap .
we &apos;d be giving him exactly what he wants .
jessica was wrong .
is that a fact ?
you looked at it the right way .
you just came to the wrong conclusion .
stemple wants us to fight , but i know why .
he was on this case
long before you and i came into the picture .
what he wants ... what he really wants ...
has nothing to do with you .
don &apos;t you look ready to rumble ?
we &apos;re not .
we want to take your deal , with one small change .
i &apos;m not lowering the amount .
no , don &apos;t worry . instead of $ 10 million ,
we &apos;d like to give you 100 million .
because that would still cost us less
than if we fought you and you got this .
i have no idea what that is .
yes , you do .
it &apos;s the glue that enables ayz
to stack more microchips than you ,
and you &apos;ve been after it for a year .
and when you saw me coming ,
you used the opportunity to bait me
into introducing evidence
so that you could turn it around and manufacture a suit
to get your hands on that during discovery .
you can &apos;t prove that .
i can when i ask your analyst
why you hired him in the first place .
he &apos;s gonna say that janus needed the technology
and was willing to do anything to get it .
you don &apos;t know that he &apos;ll roll over on me .
ali versus liston .
i &apos;m gonna make him roll over on you .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
you &apos;re gonna drop the suit ,
publicly admit to wrongdoing , and pay us this .
this &apos;ll cost my client a fortune .
yeah , but it &apos;s better than being convicted
of corporate espionage .
eliot , i &apos;m giving you a dignified way out ,
a chance to really put it to bed .
now the judge is gonna bang that gavel in 30 seconds .
and when that happens , it &apos;s gonna be too late .
we &apos;ll take the deal .
i &apos;m just saying , if you &apos;re gonna quote a movie ,
quote a movie .
i got one word wrong .
it changed the entire meaning of the quote .
not to me , it didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s what i thought the quote was .
okay , fine .
you want to be disrespectful to martin scorsese ,
you go right ahead .
martin scorsese didn &apos;t even write the damn movie .
if anything , it &apos;s disrespectful to the writer .
harvey , who cares about the writer ?
i guess you &apos;re right about that .
where have you two been ?
i took him to dinner .
oh , that &apos;s never happened before .
well , he &apos;s never beaten a.eliot stemple before .
no , he hasn &apos;t .
what could be different about this time ?
i didn &apos;t work for him then .
yeah , but didn &apos;t he duck harvey
the whole time you did work for him ?
okay , fine .
you were responsible for beating stemple ,
but i was the one who told you about harvey &apos;s shameful losses
in the first place .
what does he always say ?
0 and everything , donna . 0 and everything .
are you finished ?
yes , thank you .
oh , and jessica wanted to see you
as soon as you got back .
she say what it &apos;s about ?
no , but i was talking to mike .
i heard you won .
oh , we didn &apos;t just win .
i know .
you got a fortune 500 company to publicly admit wrongdoing .
doesn &apos;t happen every day .
so why don &apos;t you look happy ?
i am happy about the win .
but i got a call from the editor of new york lawyer ,
and they want to interview the man responsible
for making that happen .
and you want to give harvey the credit .
i want you to take your name off .
i already did .
this case was never for me . it was for harvey .
i took my name off as first chair
the second we trapped stemple .
i appreciate that .
but because of this interview , you can &apos;t be any chair .
so you don &apos;t want me off this case
so that harvey can get the credit .
you want me off this case ,
so i don &apos;t get anywhere near the spotlight .
in your position ,
the spotlight can become an interrogation lamp
pretty damn fast .
i understand .
no spotlight .
this is always how it &apos;s gonna be , isn &apos;t it ?
i thought you knew that .
i guess i did .
hey , can i talk to you ?
sure , louis . what can i do for you ?
um , i &apos;m sure you heard about dana scott &apos;s throttling of me .
i haven &apos;t .
you both wanted me to stay out of it , and i did .
right .
see , after scottie took my case , i went to jessica .
i was after blood , and ... she told me--
she told me that i bring these things on myself ,
and she was right .
and that got me to wondering , what would &apos;ve happened
if i hadn &apos;t shown up to that meeting late ?
so i went to the library ,
and i found a copy of the bylaws .
scottie underlined six different traps .
she deliberately picked a fight to embarrass me ,
and i want to know if you knew .
she didn &apos;t do it to embarrass you .
she wanted to beat the meanest , toughest guy at the firm .
okay .
it &apos;s a sign of respect .
see , the problem with that is ,
when that guy loses ... he &apos;s done .
he is no longer the meanest , baddest guy in the firm .
he &apos;s nothing .
louis ...
what do you want from me ?
i need you to use your power
to give me this case over scottie .
i can &apos;t do that .
harvey , she can survive this . i can &apos;t .
louis--
listen , you came to me
and said i was your friend when you needed a favor .
well , i am now coming to you ,
saying that i need a favor in return .
the last time we talked ,
you said if i value our friendship at all ,
i &apos;d stay out of it .
i don &apos;t care .
i know how you operate .
i let it go with mike for you .
and what i &apos;m asking for in return
doesn &apos;t even come close , so ...
i do operate that way , louis ,
but not with my friends .
so i &apos;m only gonna ask you this once .
are you asking as a friend , or are you calling in a chit ?
i &apos;m calling in a chit .
so be it .
are you mad ?
i &apos;m disappointed .
harvey , i--
you can &apos;t have it both ways , louis .
the furniture came .
look , i know we said that we &apos;d go with all my choices ,
but it turns out you have got pretty good taste .
yes . yes , i do .
so ? what do you think ?
i think that i can &apos;t believe
you did all of this in one day .
well , i &apos;ve been working on it since i got home .
i just wanted to have all of it ready ,
so we could celebrate your big win .
was harvey appreciative ?
yeah , are you kidding ? he took me out to dinner .
oh ! dinner .
next thing you know , you &apos;ll be getting a promotion .
yeah . next thing .
hey .
hey , yourself .
i hope you don &apos;t mind that i let myself in .
you ready to celebrate ?
i &apos;m ready for a drink .
well , hurry up .
because underneath these clothes ,
i am entirely naked .
scottie .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you were in such a good mood earlier .
what happened ?
i was .
but ?
scottie , i need you to give louis his transaction back .
what ?
he figured out that you set the whole thing up ,
and he came to me .
so what ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
you can survive this . he can &apos;t .
wait , so let me get this straight .
louis tells me that if i lose
i can &apos;t go running to my boyfriend ,
and then he turned around and does the exact same thing ?
scottie , i need you to do this .
does this have something to do with that favor he did you ?
yes .
okay . tell me what it is .
i can &apos;t .
guess we &apos;re not sharing everything
with each other after all .
scottie .
harvey , before you say what you &apos;re about to say ,
i need to know .
am i talking to my boyfriend ,
or am i talking to a name partner ?
that depends on your answer .
you can &apos;t have it both ways , harvey .
then you &apos;re talking to a name partner .
