once upon a time ...
there was a lonely king .
he spent many days and many nights
wandering searching
looking for that one special someone .
good night .
good night jody .
good night mrs. clemons .
that ... one ...
perfect ... woman
who would be his queen .
daddy !
i was hoping you &apos;d come tonight .
can you tell me another story ?
well ...
if you lay back down there
and close your little eyes .
close your eyes .
and the lonely king searched far and wide
looking for this woman who would be his queen .
he had almost given up hope of ever finding her
when he came upon this small tavern ...
with a simple country barmaid .
now when she looked at the lonely king
he felt as if they had known each other
for a thousand years .
do you need a refill ?
tanya i guess i &apos;m going home alone .
excuse me a second .
first of all you &apos;re not alone .
and secondly you &apos;re not driving .
keys .
betty sam needs a cab .
sure .
that &apos;s weird .
did you see where that guy went ?
so he waited
until she was alone
watching from afar
because he was afraid to speak to her .
and then one day ...
her carriage wouldn &apos;t start .
and the king thought ...
this is fate .
and so he rode down to rescue her .
and she said to him ...
must be the rain .
pop the hood .
thank you !
did he rescue her daddy ?
was she the one ?
well the king thought so .
try it now !
yes ...
hey i appreciate your--
hello ?
hello ?
you ok ?
so they rode off into the night together .
and they lived happily ever after ?
well no sweet pea .
she wasn &apos;t the one .
but don &apos;t worry .
the king &apos;s never gonna stop looking .
what if he never finds a queen ?
well then he &apos;ll just--
we &apos;ll just go to a better place .
good night princess .
her name was tanya hill . she was 29 a bartender .
found 2 days ago in edgewood new mexico .
she &apos;s the fifth woman in over 6 months
to be found dead in a ditch off the i @-@ 40 and i @-@ 25 .
all were manually strangled . none were sexually assaulted .
well maybe the act of strangulation is what gets him off .
where were they abducted from ?
all over .
well they &apos;re not just crossing state lines .
these cities are hundreds of miles apart .
that &apos;s a lot of bodies . why is it taking so long to be invited ?
we haven &apos;t been invited . we found this on hsk database .
well a lot of police departments won &apos;t want this problem .
the geographic profile shows that only one of them has it .
they just don &apos;t know it yet .
how do you know that ?
because he has a comfort zone
based on the direction he was heading when he dumped the bodies .
all 5 cases point to our unsub
heading to edgewood new mexico .
now so are we .
you got a ride .
hi !
oh . excuse me .
i think you forgot these .
hee hee !
you are so cute .
bye !
goodbye .
do you know anyone that &apos;s heading west ?
hmm . sorry .
i am .
great .
criminal minds s05e17
tennessee williams said
&quot; we &apos;re all of us sentenced to solitary confinement
inside our own skins for life . &quot;
clearly this unsub doesn &apos;t care about his victims being found .
or he knows he can &apos;t be linked to them .
the m.e. &apos; s report supports that .
matching dna was found on all 5 victims .
but not in any database .
right .
it &apos;s also in keeping with the victimology and abduction sites .
which are what ?
target rich and offender friendly .
time of death from time of abduction
varies dramatically in each case .
some lived 12 hours others 24 before they were killed .
so what &apos;s he doing with them ?
well he &apos;s not having sex with them .
there &apos;s no sign of torture or even restraints .
what was the matching dna ?
uh skin . that and metal shavings were found
under the fingernails of all 5 victims .
tanya only had one nail left .
one nail ?
yeah . it looks like whatever she was in
she tried to claw her way out .
jj have garcia match victimology
and abduction sites to hsk findings for the last year .
if he sticks to this timeline
edgewood is about to discover another body .
so she was abducted 32.9 miles west of here
which means if they drove the speed limit
they got here in 30 minutes or less .
so how long &apos;s it gonna take you
to get in that ditch ?
get in that ditch ?
i got shot in the knee remember ?
my doctor said i &apos;m not allowed to do any climbing .
it &apos;s a ditch .
new boots huh ?
italian leather ?
yeah what can i tell you ?
so uh
from here i can be seen by any passing vehicle .
and i can &apos;t .
so she was dumped at night .
must have .
he drives up
dumps the body .
job done he leaves .
i don &apos;t think so .
what ?
all 5 victims were found posed in the fetal position
with their right arm palm @-@ up left arm palm @-@ down .
remorse ?
or staging .
to look like what ?
like they &apos;re asleep .
you have any ideas why ?
no .
well i guess there is a first time for everything .
hey rossi i &apos;m gonna need a little bit of help
getting out of this ditch .
rossi !
rossi ?
hey--
i got it .
listen i appreciate you guys coming down here
but i only got one body .
which we believe is the work of a serial killer .
doesn &apos;t it have to be more than one to be a series ?
if you include a slightly larger area than just edgewood
we &apos;ve got 5 bodies .
all strangled all staged and all dumped .
why edgewood ?
it &apos;s significant to him .
we believe that he either grew up here or he lives here now .
look i &apos;m sorry that somebody &apos;s driving through my town
and dumping bodies but it doesn &apos;t mean he lives here .
we &apos;re searching for more victims
through the hsk database .
what &apos;s that ?
highway serial killer database .
we started it a few years ago
to track bodies found off of major highways
all over the country .
law enforcement no matter how small the town
reports the murders and
we use the database to try to connect them .
whoever &apos;s killing these women isn &apos;t slowing down
and he &apos;s about to dump another body on your doorstep .
oh god .
oh my god .
stop ! stop ! what do you want ? !
i &apos;ll do anything . just tell me what you want !
i want you to be quiet .
ok ok i &apos;ll stop .
what else ?
what else do you want ?
to talk .
ok we can talk .
we can talk . i want to talk .
i want to do that .
no ...
here &apos;s an m.e. file of another victim .
we know that all these women
were strangled by the same unsub .
there &apos;s evidence found by dna
and metal fragments under their fingernails
but there &apos;s something else .
tanya had diesel fuel on her clothing .
well she was found off the freeway .
i &apos;m sure they all had .
they all did . and sugar .
table sugar was found on almost all the victims &apos; clothing .
sugar ?
it absorbs diesel fuel .
it &apos;s a trucker trick .
we know how he &apos;s transporting them .
i &apos;m thirsty .
please i need a drink .
i have some questions first .
anything .
what do you want to know ?
well it &apos;s important ...
it &apos;s important that you listen .
are we clear ?
ok .
are you religious ?
what ? i &apos;m sorry ?
do you believe in god ?
yeah .
do you want children ?
someday ...
maybe .
yeah i do .
i do . i really want kids .
i don &apos;t believe you do .
no--
let me out of here !
courtney it doesn &apos;t mean he won &apos;t invite you to the prom .
seriously mom you just wouldn &apos;t understand .
you know i did go to high school at one time .
yeah like 50 years ago .
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m talking to you about this .
i &apos;m just gonna let that one go .
thank goodness .
yeah ok .
courtney ?
courtney is that you ?
hey will you stop fooling around .
aah ! no !
all right .
all right thanks baby girl .
garcia says there &apos;s 782 truckers
working and living in this county .
we gotta narrow down the specific routes .
we &apos;ll need more than that .
the daughter confirmed .
definitely driving a big rig .
now she wasn &apos;t able to make out any logos or see the plate .
i &apos;d like to talk to her .
i got checkpoints at every route in and out of the county .
if he &apos;s on the road we &apos;ll find him .
he doesn &apos;t hunt at rest stops .
he just did .
it &apos;s way too isolated here .
it &apos;s a perfect place to take somebody .
not for this guy . he goes to offender friendly environments
so he can blend in and still interact with his victims .
he hasn &apos;t had a chance to do that .
well if he &apos;s from here why would he need a rest stop ?
clean up maybe .
you check the rest rooms yet ?
yeah the sink is full of dirt in the men &apos;s room .
this is a dump site .
it &apos;s not an abduction site .
he must have dumped a body around here somewhere .
sheriff i want you to have your officers spread out .
tell them to start with the ditches .
any distinguishing marks ? anything at all ?
i wasn &apos;t looking .
i was texting .
i heard a truck start .
when i went to the bathroom she was gone .
how are you gonna find her ?
there &apos;s a good chance he &apos;s gonna stay here .
why wouldn &apos;t he just run ?
because he always comes back to edgewood .
your mother is the first woman he &apos;s taken from here .
we were just driving through .
we live in phoenix .
mom was just trying to get me home
so i could go to tryouts .
you have to find her . she &apos;s all i have .
you should come down to the station .
excuse me .
hey where are you ?
i &apos;m in the woods south of you .
you need to see this .
strangled metal shavings under her nails .
he dumps her body
he cleans up at the rest stop
and then just happens to stumble onto nancy campbell .
so he didn &apos;t wait a minute between victims
and he left the daughter as a witness .
hey . what &apos;s going on with him ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
ok .
latest victim is younger than the others .
was she posed as well ?
yeah .
nancy campbell &apos;s abduction hit the news .
let &apos;s hope he doesn &apos;t see it .
he could panic and then he &apos;ll dump her faster than the last one .
why has he dumped one victim and taken another within the hour ?
what have you got garcia ?
a bloody and busy trucker .
i have been on the hsk myself .
i &apos;ve connected 4 more victims to this guy .
i &apos;m sending their names to you now .
brings his count to 10 .
we need to get photos of
the victims garcia identified up on the board .
if we figure out why he &apos;s choosing these women
we find him .
please !
please let me out ! i can &apos;t breathe !
shh .
why are you doing this ?
keep quiet and the light stays on .
what--what do you want ?
what do you want ?
you .
no ... please ...
please ...
what &apos;s all this ?
there are 4 more victims ?
he started killing months before we thought .
his first victim was erika joy
from lexington south carolina .
she disappeared from a truck stop .
what did she do for a living ?
according to her rap sheet everyone she could .
so she &apos;s a lot lizard .
it &apos;s a name they give prostitutes who hang around truck stops .
what about the others ?
waitress gas station attendant female trucker .
any of them married ?
just nancy campbell the latest abductee
but she &apos;s a widow .
yeah well her mom &apos;s gonna get
a lot more attention than ...
well all these other women .
taking nancy campbell was a huge risk .
it doesn &apos;t fit his m.o.
he must have had a reason .
we just got some new information .
come with me .
sorry . i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
he had to have walked right by that minivan .
why didn &apos;t he take courtney ?
maybe she &apos;s too young .
she &apos;s closer to the victims &apos; ages than her mother .
that parking lot was deserted .
he could have taken courtney nobody would have seen a thing
but instead he walks past her--
because that &apos;s not who he wants .
he watched nancy .
he followed her because he wanted her .
so much so that he left courtney as a witness ?
what could be that important ?
well until a few hours ago he had a type .
the other victims were younger less sophisticated .
it wouldn &apos;t take more than a day
to figure out if they &apos;re worthy or not .
of what ?
being his companion .
then he &apos;s completely delusional .
there are easier ways to figure that out .
no not for this guy .
he &apos;s got a schedule that forces him to stay on the road .
he &apos;s alone for long stretches .
he can &apos;t devote any real time to courting .
you really think he &apos;s killing
because he &apos;s lonely ?
it wouldn &apos;t surprise me .
how are the pancakes princess ?
not as good as yours .
excuse me .
look daddy . do you like it ?
well now ...
yeah that &apos;s beautiful .
you know your daddy really misses you .
can you tell me another story ?
ok .
so ...
the lonely king had all but given up hope
of ever finding the beautiful queen .
when all of a sudden ...
she appeared .
now this time it was different .
this time
he knew she was the one .
this time ...
she was perfect .
courtney ?
courtney is that you ?
hey will you stop fooling around .
sorry sweetie it &apos;s time to go .
do we have to ?
it &apos;s time for school .
here .
why don &apos;t you go pick out a candy bar
to put in your lunch .
oh hey princess don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll be a family again real soon .
you &apos;ve got to stop telling her that .
why ? it &apos;s true .
nothing &apos;s changed .
the judge isn &apos;t gonna let her live with you .
i am trying--
she &apos;s being placed with her adoptive family .
she is my daughter .
you people can &apos;t just take her away .
you can &apos;t just do that ! i have more time .
mr. hatchett please .
i wanted you to see her
but clearly that was a mistake .
you &apos;ve known for months now
that this was a possibility .
i &apos;m gonna make this work .
by this afternoon ?
you can &apos;t take care of her .
you can barely take care of yourself .
you &apos;re living in your truck .
you &apos;re on the road and without a wife or a home
you just-- you can &apos;t do it .
you gotta let her go .
let her be happy .
i know you want that for jody .
her mom would want what &apos;s best for her .
i &apos;m what &apos;s best for her .
look i made a promise
that i would not let anything happen to her .
she is my little girl .
no one &apos;s gonna love her the way that i can .
why can &apos;t you understand that ?
you all set ?
i love you daddy .
i love you too .
what about the queen ?
is she the one ?
i don &apos;t know .
the story &apos;s not over yet princess .
nancy campbell &apos;s been missing over 12 hours .
if he jumped on the i @-@ 40 before we got the police blocks out--
he could be 3 states over by now .
we don &apos;t think he has time for that .
he &apos;s courting these women . he needs them in edgewood .
there are over 800 truckers on this list .
we have to get garcia to run background on all of them .
he &apos;s either parked at his own house
or he &apos;s hiding in plain sight .
listen i &apos;ve already given you a list
of all the trucker stops that we &apos;ve checked in town .
we gonna need to check them again .
i &apos;ve searched for you for a long time .
did you know that ?
you know how important family is don &apos;t you ?
see i knew you would .
you &apos;re not like the others .
oh would you like some water ?
no thank you .
that &apos;s not polite .
i &apos;m sharing with you .
you should accept .
yeah please . that would be great .
much better .
you know family &apos;s everything .
with family you &apos;re-- you &apos;re never alone .
please ...
if our daughter were crying ...
what would you do to get her to stop ?
please let me go .
if our daughter were crying
what would you do to get her to stop ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;d tell her a story .
i would--i &apos;d hold her . i don &apos;t know .
you like stories ?
our daughter likes stories .
look at you . you &apos;re a mess .
i don &apos;t want the princess to see you
all dirty like that .
i have a daughter .
please let me go .
please let me go .
please !
please !
let me go !
please ...
please let me go !
let me go !
please ...
that &apos;s fine .
thanks .
is this about that missing woman ?
do you know anything about it ?
only what i saw on the news .
we have reason to believe that our suspect
has been in your facility in the past 24 hours .
here ?
you think he &apos;s here ?
we could really use your help .
well we could give you our manifest .
it logs all the truckers and their loads .
that &apos;s exactly what we need .
all right get up . you &apos;re coming with me .
i said get up !
all right . take it easy !
it &apos;s your dime mr. amazing .
listen i might have something to narrow your search .
we don &apos;t think he drives for a company .
the schedules are way too tight .
in the past few months he &apos;s had the flexibility
to hunt and kill and he couldn &apos;t do all that and run loads .
so you need me to narrow down
the independent contractors .
you &apos;re reading my mind red .
i just emailed you the manifest from the local depot
where all the truckers check in . can you
of course i can .
76 licenses registered under own authority
and i just sent them back to you .
woman you are good .
you have no idea .
so how many of these cases have you worked on ?
too many .
how many of these women have you gotten back alive ?
all right so let &apos;s go over this again .
this offender &apos;s preferential
young women mid- to late 20s .
he takes his time watching them .
he makes sure there are no witnesses .
he kills them 12 to 24 hours after abduction .
only now that timeframe &apos;s getting shorter .
then he comes home to edgewood
where he &apos;s home and he feels safe .
courtney listen this man
he doesn &apos;t try to hide his victims .
so you think she &apos;s still alive ?
i was so rude to her .
i just don &apos;t want the last thing i said to her to have been ...
if he had hurt her
we would have found her already .
so what &apos;s he doing to her ?
there &apos;s no rape involved .
so is it companionship he &apos;s after ?
there might be an almost chivalrous aspect to this .
how do you figure ?
truckers have a romanticized image of themselves
and in fact all lifestyles
revolving around the open road do .
the hell &apos;s angels for instance
they refer to their women as their old ladies
but in fact there &apos;s no one they &apos;d rather protect or die for .
their treatment of women
wouldn &apos;t be out of place in king arthur &apos;s court .
and their sense of isolation would amp up their fantasy .
so he &apos;s looking for a wife .
he starts out with easy targets
then he moves on to women
who could actually fill the role .
sweet outgoing warm .
the bartender who takes extra care of you
the chatty hitchhiker .
but over the course of the day
they fail the test . this infuriates him
and he strangles them and dumps them .
ok so why take nancy campbell ?
she &apos;s the opposite of all the other victims he &apos;s taken .
it &apos;s true . she &apos;s older . she already has a kid .
maybe that &apos;s why she &apos;s still alive .
what if he &apos;s not looking for a companion ?
what if he &apos;s looking for a mother ?
if he &apos;s got a kid of his own
that would explain what keeps him coming back to edgewood .
it would explain why he walks past courtney
to get to nancy .
just by watching he knows she &apos;s a mother .
she &apos;s already qualified to pass any test .
garcia .
sir .
i want you to narrow down the own authority trucker list
and tell me which ones have been through a divorce recently
or a custody battle .
custody fight would be a stressor .
limit your searches to months prior to the first murder .
got it . thanks .
what &apos;s going on ?
just hold on a second .
wait what &apos;s going on ?
they found a body off the i @-@ 40 .
no identification .
is she dead ?
we don &apos;t know .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know ?
the police found a body
and they aren &apos;t sure if it &apos;s your mother .
i want to go .
i think we should wait here .
i need to see if it &apos;s her .
courtney please dr.reid and i are going to stay here with you
and as soon as we know anything we will tell you .
ok ?
i &apos;ll call emily .
are you sure ?
ok thanks .
it &apos;s not your mother .
hey baby girl talk to me .
of your 76 independent truckers
i have 28 who are currently involved in custody cases .
how many of those cases are still open ?
uh 8 pending .
not the most relationship friendly job trucking .
look for instances where the mother died .
a guy like this wouldn &apos;t tear a child away from his own mother .
caroline hatchett died in a house fire
leaving behind a 7 @-@ year @-@ old daughter jody
and a husband wade hatchett .
wade lost his home his wife
and custody of his daughter
when the courts deemed him unfit .
he &apos;s still contesting the case .
why was he deemed unfit ?
double whammy--job kept him away for weeks at a time
and he didn &apos;t have any other family to help him watch the girl .
looks like he bent over backwards trying to make it work
but she missed a lot of school
and he was charged with neglect of a minor .
you have an address ?
just a p.o. box for over a year .
what about the daughter ?
jody currently resides in foster care .
i &apos;m sending you the file now .
if this is the same unsub
he didn &apos;t bother to pose her this time .
this is much more brutal .
it feels personal .
her name is lynn clemons .
deputies found her wallet about 100 yards up .
must have spilled out when he dumped her .
garcia we need everything that you have
on a lynn clemons .
lynn clemons ? she &apos;s the ...
foster parent of jody hatchett .
i was just telling the others
her father is a trucker who lost custody
when his wife died .
jody &apos;s in the process of being adopted .
he ran out of time .
is the team on their way to his house ?
no he only has a p.o. box .
he killed the foster parent .
he &apos;s going after his daughter .
garcia where &apos;s jody hatchett right now ?
wait !
hey jody .
who are you ?
i &apos;m emily .
where &apos;s mrs. clemons ?
well i &apos;ll tell you inside ok ?
it &apos;s ok . come on .
jody .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re helping the police and we &apos;re trying to find your dad .
do you know where he is ?
no .
hotch truck &apos;s coming up the road right now .
hey jody can we go play in your room ?
it &apos;s right here .
ok .
all right .
get up .
somebody &apos;s moving toward the front of the cab .
all right it &apos;s nancy campbell .
he &apos;s behind her and he &apos;s got his gun on her .
morgan do you have a shot ?
negative . negative .
he &apos;s using her as a shield .
hotch he might kill nancy to get to jody .
did you paint all of these yourself ?
it looks like they &apos;re ... sleeping ?
yeah . the king tucks them in just like my daddy does for me .
is this your mom here this one ?
no . that &apos;s the queen .
who &apos;s that ?
she &apos;s the one that the king tried to take home
to the castle but she didn &apos;t make it .
what happened her ?
her carriage broke down
and he had to leave her behind to save the princess .
there &apos;s a lot of queens here .
they all look different .
they are .
what happened to this one here ?
she was dirty .
the king said &quot; how do you expect
&quot; to give my daughter a bath
if you can &apos;t even take one yourself ? &quot;
i like that story .
do you make up all these stories ?
no . my daddy does .
i like painting them .
well this story isn &apos;t over yet is it ?
that &apos;s what my dad said .
he did ?
today we were eating pancakes
and he said she was perfect .
hey would you like to meet a queen ?
yeah .
yeah ?
where &apos;s jody ?
i don &apos;t see her . what did they do with her ?
how old is jody ?
do you think she &apos;ll like me ?
daddy ? daddy are you there ?
hi baby .
you need to tell me the rest of the story .
well the lonely king and the queen are at the castle .
to pick up the princess ?
no the guards are in the way .
will you let the queen talk to them ?
they won &apos;t listen .
but i want to see her .
will you let her go so she can hold me ?
you said that she &apos;s perfect
that she &apos;s the one .
she wants to live in a big castle with me .
i need to see you .
ok .
hi daddy !
hi princess .
she &apos;s so pretty daddy !
go go .
now the king won &apos;t be lonely anymore .
no .
and they &apos;re gonna live happily ever after .
why aren &apos;t you coming too daddy ?
you did a great job jody .
are you going to the better place ?
what ?
yeah . we &apos;re both going to a better place princess .
close your little eyes sweet pea .
hatchett !
turn around .
christopher lasch said
&quot; family is a haven in a heartless world . &quot;
what you reading ?
the hsk database .
do you know there &apos;s probably half a dozen serial killers
driving around right now ?
what &apos;s really bothering you ?
jody lost her mom
and then her dad
and the couple that was gonna adopt her backed out .
it &apos;s all over the news .
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just not fair .
her aunt saw the story .
she came forward .
she &apos;d lost touch with jody &apos;s mom
over the past few years but she &apos;s her only living relative
and she wants to raise jody .
really ?
you know prentiss
when i think about the things we see on a daily basis
all the bad
i &apos;m still amazed at all the good .
yeah but ...
do you think it evens out ?
