good morning . name ?
ha ! not until i see my lawyer .
and by the way , i was with them last night .
max , it &apos;s just for the spring semester .
sorry , she watches a lot of lockup : raw .
uh , actually , i &apos;m here to return checks .
there is no spring semester .
the pastry school has been closed .
what ?
feel free to collect any personal items
you may have left in the workspace .
you get the weed , i &apos;ll get the other weed .
this is insane .
how can school be suddenly closed ?
oh , good , john &apos;s here . he &apos;ll know what happened .
what makes you think he knows ?
he &apos;s a big queen , max .
he &apos;ll know why school &apos;s closed ,
and why lady gaga &apos;s last album failed .
where &apos;s chef nicolas ?
france .
with his wife .
why is he in france ?
hmm , turns out someone in this room ,
maybe someone i &apos;m looking at right over there ,
had an affair with him and his wife found out all about it .
deke !
shocking ! i didn &apos;t even know chef nicolas was gay !
oh , please .
if he was gay , i would &apos;ve been all over that .
like a gorilla on a breadstick .
lady , we all know it wasn &apos;t deke .
okay , yes , yes , fine . it was me .
and my parents say i &apos;m loose as a goose .
but it was not an affair .
we made out once , in six different places ,
on eight different occasions ,
and then i ended it .
you ended that , and you ended this !
all of this ! forget my spatulas !
forget my whisk ! it &apos;s over !
brigadoon is over !
thanks , caroline !
you &apos;re acting like i &apos;m the only one
who ever closed a pastry school down .
can &apos;t you just go to deke &apos;s without me ?
i &apos;m too down in the dumps .
then what better place to be than in a dumpster ?
and deke said to make sure to bring you .
and relax , it &apos;s not a three @-@ way situation .
when we made our three @-@ way list ,
you were at the bottom with taylor swift .
well , at least i &apos;m with taylor .
on the three @-@ way list , who &apos;s above me ?
vicki what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ name
from real housewives of orange county .
is that the one with all the face work ?
you &apos;re gonna have to be more specific .
welcome , welcome .
wipe your feet on the way out .
deke , i &apos;m warning you right now ,
i am not in a partying mood .
ain &apos;t no party like a caroline party ,
&apos;cause a caroline party don &apos;t start .
i &apos;m heavy with guilt ,
and that cheese omelet we just split .
we &apos;re not partying , but i did snatch back the weed ,
&apos;cause i &apos;s perfect .
good . i got it from earl
and he says it knocks you out so hard ,
he once used it and faked death
to cash in a life insurance policy .
well , we might need to do that too after what i did .
deke , i am so sorry about all of this .
i am filled with regret
and those home fries i just ate .
we all so sad pastry school got all closed .
we don &apos;t know what to do .
i know what to do .
eat the pound cake in my purse .
okay , so we all loved the pastry school , right ?
eh , it was all right . no big deal .
no big deal ? we had sex in like
every classroom and both stairwells .
and on caroline &apos;s desk , but , eh , no big deal .
&quot; eh , &quot; kind of a big deal .
was it a tuesday , on top of the new york times ?
and did you eat my cranberry clif bar after ?
&apos;cause i made someone cry about that .
okay , yes , it was fun .
but it &apos;s over , and that &apos;s life .
pastry school , no pastry school , eh , no big deal .
i &apos;m gonna buy it .
what ?
yes !
yes , i love that frickin &apos; place !
we had sex on your desk while eating your clif bar .
it was awesome there !
deke , what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ll ask my parents to buy it as an investment .
caroline , you can run the school .
you &apos;re already killing it in the office .
and max and i can be the badass students
who won &apos;t take guff from no damn teachers .
&quot; how &apos; bout you stuff the cannoli again , bitch ?
i own the damn place ! &quot;
wait , is this even possible ?
i mean , it &apos;ll cost millions .
who cares ? he &apos;s rich !
now i get the whole idea of money .
it &apos;s lovely !
it &apos;s the greatest idea ever !
i know !
and since we &apos;re doing it together ,
you &apos;ll both have to come meet my parents .
max , they &apos;ve been asking to meet my girlfriend anyway .
meet your parents ?
eh , the pastry school wasn &apos;t all that .
the elevator opens right in your apartment ?
nope , don &apos;t belong here . hold the doors , bub !
we &apos;re okay . thank you , james .
max , just do the opposite
of everything you would normally do .
i already am . i &apos;m here !
deke , hello .
go , be warm .
hello , mrs. bromberg . i &apos;m max .
i &apos;m the housekeeper .
this is iris . been with us for years .
well , it was a lovely hug .
i &apos;ll tell your parents that you &apos;ve arrived .
so , what , max ?
you think any black woman you see here
could be my mother ?
well , any white man i see anywhere could be my father .
let &apos;s go . i already screwed up .
no , you heard iris . it was a lovely hug .
but then again , she is being paid .
here , better wear my pearls .
yeah , right !
me in those pearls is like a monkey in baby clothes--
just plain wrong .
relax , max .
what , are you crazy , touching me ?
your mother comes in here right now , and she &apos;s like ,
&quot; oh , there she is , the hooker from the projects ...
getting it on with our son in the--
what , fancy @-@ ass book room ? &quot;
deke , you have a warhol soup can ?
uh , yeah , it used to be in my bedroom .
it got moved out here after i scotch @-@ taped
a star wars poster over it .
okay , okay .
see , now , here is something we have in common .
i used to drink that soup .
i can talk about that .
perfect , yeah .
talk about that .
okay , see , when my mother was on a bender ,
i would bust open the can on the kitchen counter
&apos;cause i could never find the opener
&apos;cause she &apos;d use the sharp tip of it
to clean out her hash pipe .
give her the damn pearls .
give me the damn pearls .
it &apos;s just a little help--
a signal to the rich people
that says , &quot; i &apos;m one of you . &quot;
like seeing another hells angel wearing a vest
with a patch that says , &quot; suck it , pig . &quot;
well , deke better give me a signal
when his actual mom comes in ,
because the way i &apos;m going , i &apos;d hug oprah .
oprah doesn &apos;t like to be hugged .
a mistake i made at her legends ball .
为25位有杰出成就的非裔美国女姓 长达3日的庆祝会
one hug and 20 minutes later ,
my place setting was moved next to la toya jackson .
thanks , girl .
you &apos;re max .
i &apos;m deke &apos;s mother , genet .
uh , mom , this is our friend , caroline .
thank you for inviting us .
amazing art collection .
oh , thank you .
i &apos;m afraid my husband and i are pop art junkies .
i eat soup .
speaking of my husband ...
david !
&quot; i eat soup &quot; ?
he was right behind me .
oh , sometimes i swear ,
i should just leave a trail of bread crumbs .
that &apos;s funny .
okay , hold on a second there , folks .
i &apos;m just sending some business emails .
actually , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m looking at celebrities without their makeup ,
and i gotta say , hugh jackman ?
better without makeup .
i &apos;ll take that .
all right .
and what &apos;s in your mouth ?
sour ball .
give it to me , please .
genet , i &apos;m a grown man . i can have a sour ball .
you asked me to help you stop eating candy .
it &apos;s just one sour ball .
spit it out .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
it &apos;s a mini 3 musketeers .
there he is !
there &apos;s my son ,
until we get the results of the paternity test back .
i love him !
ugh , hey , come on .
no tongue in front of my girlfriend .
max , come over here .
fine , but no tongue till after dessert .
&quot; no tongue till after dessert &quot;
she &apos;s pretty and funny .
who &apos;s your bodyguard ?
this is my friend ...
mm , help me out . totally blanked .
oh , she &apos;s a little nervous .
hello , mr. bromberg . i &apos;m caroline .

yes , but just one .
but not because i &apos;m pregnant ! what ?
sit , let &apos;s talk .
yes , let &apos;s sit down ,
have a nice conversation ,
get to know each other better .
so , tell me about pastry school .
yes , tell us about pastry school .
well , we went to class the other day and it was closed ,
and john , this big , gay pastry chef , was freaking out .
max does a great impression of him .
no . no , i don &apos;t .
yes , max , it &apos;s really funny and totally charming .
oh , uh , okay .
uh , he &apos;s like 6 &apos; 5 &quot; --
stand . you gotta stand .
yeah , okay , okay , okay .
and he had his arms up in the air like this ...
um , i think his arms were down .
no , they were totally over his head .
yeah , she &apos;s right , they were down .
way down , like a crocodile .
or ceelo .
身材矮胖 四肢粗短
what are you talking about ?
they were way up here .
way over his head , and--
oh , yea--they were down .
you know what ? i think he was sitting--
and was really quiet .
excuse me , i have to use the powder room .
max , would you come with me ?
try and stop me .
max , it &apos;s over here .
we &apos;re not making a break for it ?
trapped . trapped like rats .
what is wrong with you ?
why are you sweating so much ?
i think we &apos;d be better off just wetting the whole dress .
i know . it must be the pearls .
my white trash body is working overtime to reject them .
ooh , okay . raise your arms .
why bother ? they already hate me .
max , they do not hate you .
well , they will .
this is tommy dolan all over again .
who &apos;s tommy dolan ?
and fyi , great upper arm workout .
he &apos;s this rich kid i liked in eighth grade .
and by rich , i mean his family could afford the acne medicine .
he asked me out , but his parents said no
because i was poor .
and , to be clear , that was before i shot the ten bb &apos;s
into their front picture window .
max , you &apos;re not in eighth grade .
this is a grown @-@ up relationship .
tonight &apos;s not just about a pastry school ,
it &apos;s about you and deke , so get it together .
you have a lot on the line , and i have a neck cramp .
ladies , it &apos;s genet .
trapped . trapped like more rats .
is everything all right in here ?
i didn &apos;t take anything .
i--
caroline , do you mind if i speak to max , alone ?
our neighbors have just stopped by .
they &apos;ve opened a bottle of champagne .
it &apos;s french , wonderful . enjoy .
girl , you need to chill .
um ... uh , excuse me ?
you have got us all wrong .
you walk in here , see this fabulous apartment
and all of this &quot; fabulosity , &quot; and you think--
you think i &apos;m some rich bitch .
i am .
but i wasn &apos;t born that way .
i am from queens , new york .
yeah , that &apos;s right , i &apos;m just genet from the block .
讲述的是小街区出来的女孩 虽名利双收却不改本色
wait , then how did you get
your own elevator and fish wallpaper ?
well , when david met me , i was a dancer .
oh , you mean like on broadway ?
yeah , well , close to broadway .
the point is that we fell in love so completely
that i even stopped taking his money after the third visit .
tell us , deke ,
why a pastry school of all things ?
who cares ? we &apos;re just thrilled
he &apos;s no longer in the circus .
girls--
i didn &apos;t take anything .
amy and adam have lived in the building since deke was little .
mom , don &apos;t tell max i &apos;m little .
i &apos;ve convinced her i &apos;ve got
the biggest one she &apos;ll ever have .
oh , deke !
naughty , dirty , funny .
andy and i love naughty comedy .
we watch bill maher .
this pastry school would be
a huge financial commitment , david .
why don &apos;t you just go down to union square
and light a bag of money on fire ?
mr. chase , i agree , it &apos;s a huge undertaking .
and if you &apos;d like , we can discuss a business plan .
i did graduate top of my class from wharton .
wharton . in philadelphia .
the city of brotherly love .
and let me tell you , it certainly is .
our son , hunter , went to wharton .
he &apos;s about your age .
i &apos;ll text and tell him we &apos;ve met you .
what is your last name , caroline ?
channing .
caroline channing ?
your father isn &apos;t martin channing ,
the one in prison for the ponzi scheme ?
amazing fish ! i @-@ i love this tilapia .
it &apos;s almost a chicken @-@ y fish .
deke , you never told us about this .
what , that the fish was chicken @-@ y ?
you know that &apos;s why i don &apos;t come home anymore .
why would i tell you ?
she didn &apos;t steal the money , he did .
deke does have a point .
it wasn &apos;t caroline , and her father is serving time .
ah , speaking of serving , there are like nine forks here .
where do i go next ?
it &apos;s easy for you to say , deke . you didn &apos;t lose money .
amy and i had to move from the penthouse
to the fourth floor .
the fourth floor , deke !
that &apos;s three above the doorman .
only five bedrooms , and i can hear the &quot; whoosh @-@ whoosh &quot;
of the damn elevator all night long !
genet , i cannot believe you would invite
a channing into your home .
sir , if you say another bad word about her ,
i &apos;m gonna &quot; whoosh @-@ whoosh &quot; you off that chair .
max , these are our friends .
yeah , well she is my friend ,
and she &apos;s had it pretty rough .
and i &apos;m not gonna sit here and let them insult her .
oh , you only have five bedrooms ?
well , she sleeps in the wall .
you rich people are all the same .
max , take it down .
you &apos;re gonna &quot; whoosh &quot; you did later .
no , deke . i mean , look at this table .
seven forks and ten knives , for what ?
you know what we have at our apartment ?
five chopsticks and a spork from kentucky fried chicken ,
and we do fine .
we don &apos;t need to sit here and gravel--
grovel . whatever ...
for your money or their approval .
all i can say is , you rich people are lucky
those cops took my bb gun . let &apos;s go , caroline .
no , this is my fault . i &apos;ll go .
no , you know what ? we &apos;ll all go .
deacon , sit down .
you are not leaving the table with them .
i go where she goes .
except not in the bathroom ,
because we like to leave a little mystery .
i mean , what is the big deal , anyway ?
you have a problem with her because of her father ,
but no problem with his mom being a stripper ?
what ? you were a stripper ?
mom ?
max !
oh , is that not common knowledge ?
i feel so bad .
don &apos;t . i should have guessed .
my mom &apos;s way too limber at tennis .
and it totally makes me respect my dad more .
a jew marrying a black woman is impressive .
marrying a black stripper is awesome .
no , i feel bad about your parents
cutting you off financially .
but you &apos;re okay with outing my mom ?
look , they gave me a choice , my money or you .
it only took me two hours to decide , and i picked you .
i wish it took you two hours .
you didn &apos;t even think it over .
you were out of there immediately .
deke , how are you gonna live without money ?
hey , i already live in a dumpster .
i &apos;m used to roughing it .
who bought the dumpster ?
they did .
who bought the solar panels on the roof ?
they did .
but i bought that cool skateboard poster .
deke--
okay , it was in a box of honeycomb .
and who bought the honeycomb ?
they did .
max , it &apos;ll be fun .
oh , come on . how hard could it be ?
look , i get up tomorrow , i get a job here ,
zippity @-@ boo , get another job there .
now i got 20,000 , then zippity @-@ pow ,
make another 20,000 , zippity @-@ zang .
then i &apos;m lousy with honeycomb .
now , cheechity @-@ chong , where did i put earl &apos;s weed ?
what &apos;s the emergency ? are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine , but deke &apos;s insane !
he thinks he can make it as a poor person .
you never know , i did .
sure , the first-- what &apos;s today , monday ?
sure , the first thousand days were hard , but--
deke is nothing like you !
you are resilient and smart and creative and driven .
no one could do what you did . you &apos;re amazing .
max , that &apos;s the nicest thing you &apos;ve ever said to me .
oh , don &apos;t get all wet .
you &apos;re still at the bottom of the three @-@ way list .
my point is , i can &apos;t let deke give up his money .
it &apos;s his decision .
and it &apos;s the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
it &apos;s crap !
i care about deke more than i have ever cared about anyone ,
so i have to give him back .
i just called his mother .
at 2 : 00 a.m. , and she picked up the phone ?
oh , right , i forgot . she was a stripper .
she &apos;s used to picking things up at night .
and she said they &apos;d take deke back ,
but he has to come to them .
that &apos;s great .
so , come on .
you and i are pushing him home ...
in the dumpster .
pushing it to the upper east side ?
yes !
he &apos;s totally knocked out on earl &apos;s weed .
he will not feel a thing .
come on , help me push right now
before i realize what i &apos;m losing
and change my mind . go !
you take that side , i &apos;ll take this ,
and we won &apos;t stop till we &apos;re there
or one of us falls off the brooklyn bridge .
we can never get it there , max .
then we &apos;ll get it as far as we can ,
and then at least when deke wakes up
he won &apos;t be stuck here with me in the morning ,
and he can have a life .
i was wrong earlier .
this is the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
yeah , don &apos;t cut yourself on the dumpster
or you &apos;ll get lockjaw . push .
oh , max .
even better upper arm workout !
