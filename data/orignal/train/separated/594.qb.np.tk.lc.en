祝舒妹新婚快乐
第五季第四集
well , that was a weird afternoon .
i guess i knew pierce was part of a weird , futuristic cult ,
but i wasn &apos;t prepared for a funeral
with so much beeping .
well , let &apos;s not judge .
everyone has a right to whatever fake religion
they delusionally choose .
abed , you were by the coffin for a long time .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m okay . although ...
troy and abed are in mourning ...
will you guys please stop doing that ?
i can &apos;t believe you did during your eulogy .
so uncomfortable .
i don &apos;t think the audience got that we were singing
&quot; mourning &quot; with a &quot; u. &quot;
you were singing &quot; mourning &quot; with a &quot; u &quot; ?
oh , no .
i still don &apos;t fully understand the laser lotus theology .
so pierce &apos;s body is in the coffin ,
and we buried it ,
but this energon pod contains his life ...
vapor ?
yeah , it &apos;s all right here
in this incredibly persuasive literature they passed out .
once you reach level 16,
you can see the color blurble .
of all the ridiculous cartoon nonsense .
if there is a blurble , the lord keeps it hidden for a reason .
what up , n @-@ bombs ?
how was the funeral ? awesome ?
no , chang , our friend &apos;s funeral was not awesome .
it was deeply sad . you know , funeral style .
excuse me . i thought you guys hated pierce .
we did not hate pierce .
craziness .
all right , are you sure you guys aren &apos;t
just doing the &quot; respect the dead &quot; jig @-@ a @-@ lig ?
i think you have us mistaken for you , chang .
i don &apos;t know .
i definitely remember you complaining about him
a lot .
we complained about him when he was alive .
this is different .
can &apos;t believe we &apos;ll never see him again .
just a reminder you gotta live life to the fullest .
by the time pierce was my age ,
he had already been fired from 15 jobs .
i &apos;ve only seen two police academies .
the last two .
well , he &apos;s gone too soon but won &apos;t be soon forgotten .
i would say you &apos;re quite correct , mr. winger .
who the hell are you ?
my name is mr. stone .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
and for us to say .
i work for mr. hawthorne .
he specified in his will that no matter
how natural in appearance
the circumstances of his death ,
a private inquest should be conducted
to determine whether any one of you ,
his former study group , murdered him .
what ?
to be cleared , you must all submit to a polygraph test .
aw , schnizzle .
you guys are in trouble !
later .
mr. chang , i presume .
you &apos;re also listed as a suspect
and requested to participate .
fine , but i ask the questions .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t allow that .
all right , then just the &quot; fine &quot; part .
we &apos;re losing pierce !
everyone , quickly !
someone get a balloon .
i always wanted to try a polygraph .
they &apos;re like the pie fight of cop movies .
or the acupuncture of the legal system .
i can &apos;t believe pierce would think we might murder him .
yeah , what a waste of murder .
i mean , he was , like , 79 .
i don &apos;t suppose anyone wants to know
i consider this a violation .
come on , it &apos;s just pierce being pierce .
it &apos;s his final wish .
if i had a final wish , i &apos;d use it to stay alive .
let &apos;s do it . how do we begin ?
we &apos;re to start with miss perry .
state your name .
britta perry .
have you ever had any thoughts of violence
towards pierce hawthorne ?
no .
lie .
i mean , i may have wanted to slap him now and again ,
but i didn &apos;t kill him .
in all your sexual fantasies about pierce hawthorne ,
none of them involved his murder ?
what ? no .
but you have had sexual fantasies
about mr. hawthorne .
no ! what kind of question is that ?
i &apos;m asking the questions
just as mr . hawthorne wrote them down ,
i assure you .
mr. winger , state your name .
jeffrey winger .
are you gay ?
no .
are you sure you &apos;re not gay ?
yes .
gay murderer says what .
what ?
he &apos;s telling the truth .
i &apos;ve been instructed to point out that that means you &apos;re gay .
ms. bennett .
state your name .
shirley bennett .
are you a dishonest person ?
no .
she thinks that &apos;s true .
uh , you could have just said no .
i &apos;m watching you acting scientific
and then adding your little every now and again .
huh ? continue .
is it true that you &apos;re a platinum level donor
with the pro @-@ life organization prenatal patriots.org ?
what ?
keep it cool , girls .
it &apos;s my money . it &apos;s my choice .
yeah , well , if i wanted the government in my uterus ,
i &apos;d fill it with oil and hispanic voters .
keep it frosty , ladies .
don &apos;t let your goats get gotched .
mr. barnes , state your name .
troy barnes .
d &apos;oh ! i meant to say , &quot; butts carlton . &quot;
he did mean to say , &quot; butts carlton . &quot;
mr. barnes , did you get angry when mr. hawthorne told you
fat albert died of diabetes ?
yes , like any american would .
angry enough to murder him ?
no .
is it true that you and abed nadir
have an elaborate doomsday escape plan
to be used in the event of zombie attacks ?
we may have a designated rendezvous point
and a couple of bugout bags
filled with gold coins and condoms
just in case we need to bargain our way onto a boat .
the gold coins are for buying food .
does your doomsday plan account for the welfare
of any of your other friends ?
pass .
answer the question .
no .
troy ! rude !
it &apos;s a doomsday plan , not a picnic plan .
do you really wanna see the horrors
we might have to endure just to get on a boat ?
i guess not .
that &apos;s a lie .
he &apos;s doing it again .
pierce is doing it again .
mr. chang , state your name .
benjamin franklin chang , ready to deal out the truth .
nothing to hide . let &apos;s do this .
have you ever masturbated in the study room ?
mr. nadir , state your name .
abed nadir .
have you ever 9 / 11&apos;d anyone ?
nope .
when you were a child ,
did you ever kill a squirrel with a slingshot
and was surprised that you felt nothing and wondered
if you were capable of doing it to a human ?
no .
do you and troy still actively use
jeff &apos;s netflix account without his permission ?
wait , what ?
you told pierce that ?
you logged in at our place
and never logged out , so we use it .
is that why my review of the grey
is constantly changing ?
yes , stop giving it four stars .
i like liam neeson !
then send him a message about the roles he chooses .
look , this is not the issue ! you &apos;re stealing from me !
and as your roommate , you &apos;re making me an accomplice .
i had no idea .
lie .
why would i even try that ?
state your name please , miss .
annie edison .
miss edison , did you use your exceptional intelligence
and organizational skills to plot the foolproof murder
of pierce hawthorne ?
aww ! and no .
is it true that you overcharged troy and abed
for their share of the rent ?
pierce !
annie ?
yes , but for a good reason .
you guys know you &apos;re bad with money .
i padded your share of the rent by $ 10
and i &apos;ve been putting it into a savings account
that yields 4 % .
you &apos;ll be thanking me in six years
when you find out you have $ 86 .
that &apos;s jacket money .
oh , did you hear that , abed ?
we &apos;ve been washing paper plates and making our own toothpaste .
but don &apos;t you worry .
when we have robot bodies on the moon ,
we can share a free jacket .
annie , you should know better than to horde money .
that &apos;s a stereotype .
was that anti @-@ semitism ?
no ! that &apos;s sensitivity .
it &apos;s anti @-@ semitic to do things like that
when you know full well you &apos;re jewish .
we could have bought a tire
for our tire swing with that money .
or your own netflix account ?
liam neeson ? not that great .
your rating system is flawed .
all right !
let &apos;s begin .
wait , wait .
what do you mean , &quot; begin &quot; ?
that completes the calibration round of questioning .
we &apos;re ready to begin the formal inquest .
i think we &apos;re ready to end .
we &apos;ve humored this long enough .
jeff ... it &apos;s for pierce .
look , respect for the dead is only a thing
because the dead usually don &apos;t do any more damage .
that &apos;s true .
you can quit any time you like .
but it should be noted that mr. hawthorne &apos;s estate
is worth over $ 20 million
and only those cleared of his murder
can receive their bequeathments .
i &apos;m only gonna say this once .
clearly , pierce is trying to lure us into a labyrinth of
emotional manipulation and strategic instigation .
and i think we &apos;re all smart enough to know
we should quit while we &apos;re not ahead .
i do believe we should ...
yes , definitely .
quit while we &apos;re ahead .
absolutely .
they &apos;re all lying .
we all know that , you judgmental bitch !
miss perry , have you eaten at the sandwich shop
started by mrs. bennetter and mr. hawthorne ?
yes .
and what sandwich would you order from shirley &apos;s sandwiches ?
the only one i can , the helen of soy with no mayo .
helen of soy .
are you aware that in order
to save money , shirley stopped using real tofu
and replaced it with a midwestern tofu substitute
called &quot; meatfu &quot; ?
oh , my god !
it &apos;s still not actually meat ... legally .
you have never respected anything that i hold sacred !
i &apos;m sorry !
shirley , did you know
that britta was high on marijuana at your son &apos;s baptism ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , no higher than usual .
not true .
you did drugs in my church ?
no , i did drugs in the parking lot of your church .
how else do you expect somebody
to sit through something like that ?
at least with a bris there &apos;s an element of suspense .
well , next time , i &apos;ll have cheech and chong do the warm @-@ up !
guys , these questions are obviously designed
to turn us against each other .
if we want to beat pierce at his game ,
we have to own up to our mistakes and forgive each other .
mr. winger , is it true that you keep trophies
of your sexual conquests ?
in a church , britta ?
for shame .
it &apos;s where jesus gets his mail .
answer the question , adrian grody !
i know what pierce is referring to .
i have a box of forgotten items in my apartment .
i happen to be a single male . visitors leave things .
is one of your trophies a pair of miss perry &apos;s panties ?
you told me a hawk stole them !
you exploited me and made me believe
in a slightly more magical world .
if you want to collect women &apos;s underwear ,
can &apos;t you just buy them ?
they have to be won in battle .
gross !
jeffrey !
awesome .
i think we can all agree that the gross thing here
is that pierce is snooping through my stuff .
not really , abed and i go through your stuff all the time .
why do you keep bread in the freezer ?
and why does your bathroom mirror say ,
&quot; you &apos;re special , &quot; when you fog it up ?
look , i don &apos;t have to answer these--
you took a shower ?
yeah .
mr. barnes .
okay ! i did it !
okay ? i killed pierce !
lie .
okay , good .
just making sure .
you and abed nadir have a specialized ,
exclusive handshake that you refuse to do with your other friends ?
absolutely .
mr. barnes , did you invent that handshake ?
yes .
lie .
mr. barnes , are you a subscriber
to the video blog &quot; fun for friends &quot; ?
no .
lie .
silence , witch !
hi , i &apos;m kevin ,
this is kyle , and here &apos;s a fun handshake
you can do with your best friend .
all right ! thanks for watching , guys .
don &apos;t forget to rate us , comment , and subscribe .
can &apos;t look at you right now .
then you should know i &apos;m crying .
i forgive you , but only to escape the established pattern
of self @-@ righteous indignation followed by immediate comeuppance .
mr. nadir .
okay , i guess it &apos;s happening anyway .
you broke my heart . continue .
is it true that you planted geo @-@ trafficking devices
on everyone in the group so that you would know
where they are at all times ?
yes .
okay , you guys are changing your faces .
are you mad at me or hungry ?
you &apos;re tracking us ?
we &apos;re mad at you , abed .
why ?
because we already live
in a totalitarian surveillance state .
do you not read my status updates ?
but i &apos;m not the government . i &apos;m your friend .
that &apos;s what governments say , nimrod .
it &apos;s cool . when one of you gets kidnapped ,
you &apos;ll be glad you don &apos;t have to count
the bumps on the highway from the trunk of the car .
are those blinking dots us ?
well , what &apos;s this one all the way to the side ?
that &apos;s where pierce is buried .
is that why you were spending so much time by the coffin ?
i was trying to get it back . they &apos;re expensive .
and he &apos;s not moving anymore .
abed , where did you plant these things ?
if it makes you feel any better , you &apos;ll never find them .
i know you know it &apos;s wrong to do that without telling us .
shame on you !
okay , i &apos;m ashamed .
lie .
lie .
miss edison , is it true you once secretly dosed
the members of your study group
with a pharmaceutical amphetamine ?
oh , uh , yes , kind of .
what ?
it sounds worse on paper than it was .
we were cramming for the anthro final .
everyone was falling asleep .
i put 5 milligrams of something @-@ something
in your coffees and we all got an &quot; a. &quot;
done !
i &apos;m a bad person for tracking your location ,
but you altered my brain chemistry ?
i was up for three days that week .
i invented an entire language ,
you fliztbarping gitzgorg .
i &apos;m sorry .
you messed with my brain .
that &apos;s a big deal . this is a big deal .
i don &apos;t mess with your brain , annie .
you kind of do .
i don &apos;t think i do .
what about her facebook boyfriend ?
what ?
that &apos;s different .
you made a profile for a fake dude
and lured her into an online relationship .
he &apos;s catfishing you .
you &apos;re olympic pole @-@ vaulting hopeful brent underjaw ?
i noticed whenever you were in a relationship ,
you hummed a lot and made pancakes in the morning .
it wasn &apos;t about hurting you .
i did what i did in the name of breakfast .
i bore my soul to you !
i told you about my holding hands at disneyland fantasy .
do you care about people at all , abed ?
answer on the polygraph !
jeff made me apply for handicapped parking
so he can get a better spot .
britta &apos;s the one that invited garrett
to annie &apos;s birthday party !
troy won &apos;t sit on a toilet seat after jeff !
when we &apos;re alone , shirley refers to you guys
as &quot; those people . &quot;
oh ! when annie &apos;s with other females , dude ,
she calls jeff her uncle !
shirley thinks we &apos;re all going to hell !
you are all going to hell !
oh , what ?
guys , stop !
we have to stop letting pierce do this to us !
mr. hawthorne hasn &apos;t asked a question
in quite some time , mr. winger .
he &apos;s right .
i actually forgot for a second that pierce was dead .
maybe that &apos;s what he wanted .
or maybe he wanted us to know
we &apos;re no better off without him .
or no better than him .
he kind of nailed it , didn &apos;t he ?
i didn &apos;t just masturbate in the study room .
i masturbated everywhere .
everywhere !
confession is good for the soul .
you should try it sometime .
there &apos;s another round of questions if you &apos;d like to continue .
you want to give us a moment to sit in our own filth
before you heap another bucket on us ?
it &apos;s strange after all these years
how much we &apos;ve kept hidden from each other .
you &apos;d think by now we would have learned to be better people .
i think we got into this mess by thinking
there was such a thing as better people .
wait . that &apos;s it .
if we &apos;re no better than pierce ,
and pierce is no worse than us , then that means
nobody &apos;s really that bad .
so what if we &apos;re willing to suffer and inflict pain
at the mere prospect of material reward ?
if we stop now , that doesn &apos;t make us better .
it just makes us so dishonest that we would rather be poor
than admit we &apos;re flawed .
pierce admitted he was flawed , and he died rich .
let &apos;s celebrate his life and death in the honest way ,
not by saying fake nice things around a casket ,
but by admitting we &apos;re monsters
and clawing joyfully for some of his cash .
so does anybody have anything left before we continue ?
let &apos;s empty our tanks of lies once and for all .
i &apos;m jeff winger , and if i had my choice ,
i would rather look at myself naked
than the women i sleep with .
i &apos;m the one who hit jeff &apos;s lexus in the parking lot .
it wasn &apos;t a taco truck , and it was racist of me
to improvise such an ethnically specific vehicle .
i only give money to homeless people
when i &apos;m walking with someone .
i &apos;ve never been to legoland .
i just wanted you guys to think i was cool .
i can be passive @-@ aggressive sometimes .
don &apos;t everybody disagree at once .
oh , lord , i did it again .
when any of you chew gum , i want to punch you .
you may as well have submachine guns in your mouths .
it vibrates my skull .
everybody clear ? all right .
mr. stone , hit us with your grand finale .
may it be as brutal as we deserve .
very well .
mr. hawthorne &apos;s final round of questions .
britta perry ...
do you know that you hate yourself more than you should
and that your passion inspired me ?
no .
that &apos;s true . she didn &apos;t know .
to miss perry , i leave my ipod nano
filled with music to take life less seriously by .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
i also leave you this liquid nitrogen cooled cylinder
of my hyper @-@ virile sperm
in case your lesbian lifestyle one day wears out
and you wish to raise an army of geniuses .
shirley ...
did you know that you are not only a credit
to your race and gender , but to our species ,
and that i was intimidated by your strength of character
and business acumen ?
yes .
to shirley bennett ,
i leave my spacious timeshare in florida ...
where she can take what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name
and however many children she has now .
i also leave you a cylinder of my sperm .
annie edison ...
did you know that you were always my favorite ?
you mentioned it once , but--
i leave you this tiara , which you once refused to accept .
it &apos;s the same tiara i used to wear
when my mother would verbally assault me
for not being a little girl .
also sperm .
jeff winger , did you know you &apos;re gay ?
no .
agree to disagree .
to you , i leave this bottle of fine scotch
so that you &apos;re less tempted to drink
this cylinderof even finer sperm .
abed nadir , did you know that you are insane
and nothing that you said ever made any sense to me ?
yep .
here &apos;s your sperm .
troy barnes , did you know that you possess
the greatest gift life can give--
the heart of a hero-- and that it &apos;s up to you
not to waste it like i did ?
i think .
to troy , i leave the obligatory sperm .
maybe it &apos;s because everyone else got one ,
and because it &apos;s an old man &apos;s semen ,
but , um , i &apos;m kind of disappointed .
in addition , i am prepared to leave troy barnes
my remaining shares in the hawthorne wipes company ,
currently valued at $ 14.3 million .
on one condition .
you must first sail my boat , the childish tycoon ,
by yourself around the entire world .
what ?
again with the bait and switch .
when i was 23,
my father asked me to do the same thing
to earn my adulthood and his fortune .
of course i cheated and floated off the coast of belize
for a year doing coke with john denver .
i always regretted it .
i &apos;d like to give you a chance to do what i never did :
become your own man .
okay , i &apos;m a lawyer , troy .
it should be possible
to contest these conditions as unreasonable ...
i &apos;ll do it .
and pierce can take his mind games
and his sperm and he can put--
i &apos;ll do it .
what ?
troy ?
pierce was a crazy old coot , yeah ,
but i think he knew something about me
that even i didn &apos;t know until now .
because he &apos;s offering me something
i &apos;ve been searching for my whole life .
millions of dollars .
and being a man or whatever he said .
jeff , say something .
i &apos;m speechless .
somebody say something !
abed ?
cool . cool , cool , cool .
that &apos;s a lie .
and that sperm came down .
i couldn &apos;t say anything ! .
but oh , my god ! i was gonna explode !
and then that one , that last question ,
with all of that nice stuff out on the table ,
and you guys were having this discussion
about whether or not to quit ?
at first , i was like , &quot; aaaaah ! &quot;
but you did it !
you did it !
it was amazing !
you &apos;re amazing , man ! you &apos;re amazing !
guys , this is the best .
we should do this every week .
oh , i &apos;m a fun guy , you know ?
i mean , you talk about lying .
i was lying the whole time .
this is who i really am . this is me .
this is the real me . i &apos;m artistic .
ideas come to me all the time .
i have this idea for a movie .
it &apos;s about this guy who oversees polygraph tests ,
and the biggest obstacle is how good @-@ looking he is .
people can &apos;t focus and tell the truth .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
by the way , uh ,
we never found out how pierce died .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t tell you yet .
it was dehydration from filling up all of those cylinders .
i mean , it &apos;s how i want to go , but , hey , i &apos;m a little nutty .
are you guys thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
shots !
