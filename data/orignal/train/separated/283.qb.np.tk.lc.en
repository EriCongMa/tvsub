club sandwich , burger .
why the big smile , han ?
you going commando under those corduroys ?
no , max , i am happy today because
diner clientele has finally changed for the better .
look , two parties of cool hipsters
are sitting at tables near wall .
you think those are six hipsters ?
okay , let &apos;s go over this one more time .
hipster or homeless pop quiz , ready ?
ready .
hipsters wear ?
skinny jeans .
homeless wear ?
dirty jeans .
hipsters listen to ?
radiohead .
homeless listen to ?
the voices in their head .
hipsters have ?
beard and a blog .
homeless have ?
beard and so much sadness .
i see sadness , there and there .
i &apos;ll handle this .
i told you before , i don &apos;t want you kind in here .
take a trendy hike .
better step it up . the apple store closes at ten .
max , why did you kick out the hipsters ?
&apos;cause i could not be in the background
of another instagram photo .
here &apos;s the last check , earl .
and , max , they stiffed us on the tip
but they forgot their camera .
oh , i &apos;ll give it to oleg .
he can take one of his special pictures .
that way , when they come back to get it ,
everyone will have been stiffed .
well , good night , ladies .
i gotta get home before the snow starts .
it &apos;s not gonna snow , earl , it &apos;s 50 degrees .
oh , it &apos;s gonna snow , trust me .
i couldn &apos;t tell when my first wife was coming ,
but i can sure tell when a storm is coming .
all right , so what &apos;s the plan ?
what are we gonna do if it does snow ?
you &apos;re so white , i &apos;m worried we &apos;re gonna lose you .
i love the snow .
opening my balcony doors and watching it fall
like fresh white linen and then
running across the street to the park to make snow angels .
yeah , that &apos;s snow when you &apos;re rich .
the only snow angels you &apos;ll see this year
are the six crack addicts frozen to our stoop .
oh , not to mention the adorable frozen horse
we have illegally living in the backyard .
max , don &apos;t overreact . chestnut &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s not gonna snow for weeks .
all right , have it your way .
but i wouldn &apos;t want to be the next tenants
who have to figure out why a pissed off horse
is haunting a brooklyn apartment .
i was cold and she thought she knew weather patterns .
oleg , take a picture of your junk on this customer &apos;s camera .
done .
aren &apos;t you gonna ask why ?
no need .
i just saw oleg &apos;s ...
yeah , that might have been my fault .
kind of a shock seeing it for the first time .
max , i don &apos;t like you implying
that i would ever be cruel to chestnut .
i &apos;m not implying it .
i &apos;m saying it outright .
it &apos;s winter .
and it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve not been thinking about it .
but chestnut belongs in a special home .
you belong in a special home .
i &apos;ve done some research ,
and i found a retreat in the grand tetons
where newly @-@ divorced women come to hug horses
to help them gain back their ability to trust .
the only grand tetons chestnut trusts are mine .
lady , you gotta get a reality check real quick
&apos;cause earl thinks it &apos;s gonna snow .
earl also thinks the theme from shaft
曾获第44届奥斯卡最佳原创歌曲奖
was stolen from a cassette tape he sent out in 1975 .
shut your mouth . that happened .
max , it &apos;s not gonna snow .
i know snow .
we owned a ski chalet in saas @-@ fee switzerland
被誉为 &quot; 冰河村 &quot;
and i think i know more than anyone in this restaurant
about living in cold climes .
snow is coming .
yo , swiss miss , you wanna have a conversation about cold climes
with snowleg over there ?
oh , max , i almost forgot .
the camera .
i think you &apos;ll be very pleased .
i made a little video as well .
why are you wearing two coats ?
same reason i wear two condoms .
in case one breaks .
what the ?
well , good morning , world &apos;s worst weather girl .
i have never seen so much sunshine .
you know what that means ?
earl wrote shaft .
max , i know it snowed , you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i &apos;m surrounded by so much white stuff i &apos;m like al pacino
in the last scene of scarface .
因此画面上很多白雾
what are you wearing ?
you look like a bag of crazy garbage grew arms .
it &apos;s the hefty 2011 winter collection .
i gave chestnut my coat .
this is the only way to keep the snow off me .
look at poor chestnut .
what is he wearing on his hooves ?
i cut up my fendi cashmere leggings .
i grabbed them when we raided the town house .
i thought ahead for me , but not for him .
he is humiliated in those ladies clothes .
he looks like j. edgar hoover .
有穿女性衣服的癖好
i &apos;ve been out here sweeping since 4 : 00 a.m.
but it just keeps coming down .
what is your problem , snow ?
i used to love you !
maybe we should ask your old doorman
&quot; insert generic irish name here &quot; to come help .
i know their names .
day james , night james and black james .
so your plan is you &apos;re gonna sweep the snow away till spring
while the horse is trapped under this tarp ?
which i &apos;m pretty sure was covering the out of business
cuban restaurant down the street .
they were out of business and i left a note .
what did it say ? &quot; i &apos;m loco , gracias . &quot;
no , it said , &quot; sorry i took your roof , hang in there . :
max , don &apos;t be so negative .
doesn &apos;t matter where it came from , it &apos;s working .
i just need to secure this tarp a little .
stop , you were gonna climb on an icy chair
in six inch heels and break your neck
and then i &apos;m gonna be stuck with a horse in leggings
and you in a wheelchair with a chopstick in your mouth
tapping out , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , i thought that would work . &quot;
i learned to build when i volunteered
with habitat for humanity .
looking back , they had so much more than i have now .
okay .
i gotta go to my babysitting job
and when i get back , you and i are gonna sit down
and come up with a more realistic home
for j. edgar hoofer .
max , he lives here .
and i &apos;m telling you , this is working .
what i &apos;m doing is actually kind of brilliant .
now i &apos;m worried about those houses you built .
hey , peach .
max , i have the most incredible news .
lawyer finally found a loophole in your prenup ?
i wish , no .
i just got an email
and i have made it to the final round
of casting for real housewives of tribeca .
real housewives of tribeca ?
they &apos;re doing neighborhoods now ?
what &apos;s next , real housewives of from here to there ?
the producers are on their way over
and i want everything to be perfect
when they see brad and angelina .
uh , peach , are you aware that your children
are being eaten by clothing ?
the snowsuits are burberry .
and the padding hides angelina &apos;s weight problem .
okay , you have to stop saying that .
she doesn &apos;t have a weight problem .
she &apos;s gained 25 pounds in one year .
yeah , &apos; cause she started at zero .
max , we all have to look our best , &apos; cause ready ?
the last spot in the show is between me and misty mastbaum .
i thought she was your bestie .
she is , but my bestie &apos;s a bitchy .
she &apos;s crazy competitive .
as soon as we were approached about the show ,
she adopted a three @-@ legged corgi and named it mr. pickle .
that &apos;s crazy bitchy .
so now , i &apos;m looking up handicapped animals
to impress the producers .
oh , you want a handicapped animal ?
i got your handicapped animal .
i know a homeless horse with gender identity issues .
i was thinking something cute , but damaged .
like a one @-@ eyed french bulldog .
what if i told you that this horse was a celebrity horse ?
tell me more .
my friend , caroline channing ...
how do you know caroline channing ?
she &apos;s my aa sponsor .
makes sense .
go on .
anyway , she has this cute , but crazy damaged horse
and since her life flipped upside down ,
he needs a good home .
well , i &apos;d have to meet caroline first .
bring her by on saturday .
max , what an amazing idea .
misty is literally going to die .
i am so thrilled you have a drinking problem .
did you have to put him in my bedroom ?
it was the easiest room to horse proof .
you have so little of worth .
you can stop googling . i already found
a perfectly good place to put him .
you &apos;re not still suggesting i give chestnut to peach landis ?
max , look at me . look at me in the eyes .
are you high ?
no , i couldn &apos;t find my bedroom stash
since you moved everything around .
chestnut needs a home with affection
and peach won &apos;t even hug her children .
she pays you to do that .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s perfect .
she &apos;ll pay for the fancy stable
and we &apos;ll go and hug chestnut for her whenever we want .
you just need to go meet her and it &apos;s done .
i have the dna of a rich girl ,
even though i &apos;m lying in bed with you in a tenement
and i bought my dinner tonight with dimes .
chestnut and i are old money .
and old money doesn &apos;t parade itself around
in front of cameras and beg for attention .
hey , you &apos;re not the only one with old money .
i &apos;ve had a dollar in my jeans
i &apos;ve been carrying around for three weeks .
you &apos;re meeting peach saturday ,
and we &apos;re saying good @-@ bye to the horse .
why is getting rid of chestnut so easy for you ?
didn &apos;t you ever have a pet as a child ?
yes , i had a puppy .
and after a week of living with my mom ,
she pulled the car over and put us out on the side of the road .
she got rid of it ?
look , pets are not my thing , okay ?
i already have something needy and fluffy
that &apos;ll die if i don &apos;t take care of it ... you .
go , it &apos;s your turn to go check on him .
no , i went the last time and caught him eating my bra .
don &apos;t exaggerate . he only ate half of it .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right , i should be more positive .
one of my cups is half full .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
i don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s any way
you took a giant dump on your dresser ?
you can &apos;t blame chestnut . he &apos;s probably nervous .
after wearing your leggings ,
he &apos;s getting ready for his fame audition .
he &apos;s a maniac , maniac on all fours .
oh , max , here &apos;s something .
the ivy bridge riding stables in brooklyn .
only five miles away .
it says on their website that their horses
are featured in commercials and films !
can you say chestnut , star of the war horse sequel ?
did you take the weed from my bedside table ?
look at me .
look at me in the eyes .
are you high ?
honestly ...
a little .
close that and go to sleep .
no , i &apos;m still reading .
oh look at that , i just pulled down your browser history .
interesting list .
kitten plays a keyboard ,
kitten sneezes and farts at the same time ?
give me that , that &apos;s private .
kitten folds a t @-@ shirt !
oh , kitten rings a doorbell .
i thought you said you weren &apos;t into pets .
i &apos;m not !
it &apos;s a kitten ringing a doorbell !
he &apos;s trying to get in like people .
you have a secret soft spot for animals .
no , i &apos;m just into freaky kittens .
there &apos;s one who puts on a snakeskin suit
and goes on a business trip .
that &apos;s not soft . that is freaky .
fine , you &apos;re telling me to get a reality check about chestnut .
but you need one too .
you &apos;re gonna miss him when he &apos;s gone .
max , are you listening ?
max , don &apos;t worry .
i know it &apos;s all gonna work out perfectly
at the stables tomorrow .
i &apos;m not worried .
the man &apos;s not here yet .
damn it , turn us around max , we have to enter again .
this is the third time .
max , come on , we borrowed these coats from oleg
to make a dramatic star entrance .
if you want me to fake it again ,
you have to buy me dinner and call me pretty .
fine , then help me down quickly .
i don &apos;t wanna be mid @-@ dismount when the stable guy walks in .
god , ugh .
you just sat on my face .
like i haven &apos;t done enough for you .
oh , hello , are you tony ?
last time i checked .
oh , jeez .
i &apos;m caroline channing . we spoke on the phone .
and this is chestnut .
max , step back .
oh , great . i &apos;ll just be over here
like the awkward father in the background
on toddlers and tiaras .
跟拍参加儿童选美大赛的选手及其家庭
well , here he is .
and as we discussed , chestnut is a champion jumper
his dressage is impeccable ,
he &apos;s ribboned three times at the hampton classic ,
and he comes from a historically elite line
of distinguished show horses .
and he pees like a civil rights fire hose .
max , step further back .
come on , let &apos;s cut to the chase .
he &apos;s nice , brown , he looks sick in leggings ,
and he &apos;s free , so take him or leave him .
when &apos;d you say he was a jumper ?
from 2005 to 2010 .
he was in a class by himself .
well , maybe he was a jumper ,
but he isn &apos;t anymore .
what ?
well , he &apos;s a little out of shape .
well , you have a gut .
whoa ! i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s seen better days .
i &apos;m just saying your hair is falling out in fistfuls .
okay , okay .
let &apos;s not get personal , we all want this to work .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s getting personal
going after chestnut like that .
okay , you tell me ,
when &apos;s the last time he &apos;s exercised ?
when &apos;s the last time you exercised ?
wow , show business is rough .
all right , it &apos;s tony , right ?
last time i checked .
all right , tony , you &apos;ll have to forgive her .
she really loves him and wants this to work out .
bottom line is , even a free horse isn &apos;t free .
i still have to feed him and take care of him
and truth be told , this horse isn &apos;t gonna make me a penny .
if my film guy comes in here , he &apos;s gonna pick that beauty
over this one .
so it &apos;s not gonna work out , girls .
all right , well , we got other offers , fatty .
come on , let &apos;s go .
you know , maybe next time before you let someone
ride five miles across brooklyn in a toxic , russian ,
cologne @-@ soaked rent @-@ a @-@ fur ,
you should be clear that the film business ,
even for horses , is ageist and elitist .
and , yes , we may have seen better days ,
but with hard work , determination and a little luck ,
one day we &apos;ll be back on top .
yeah , and i &apos;m not impressed by your big star pony overthere .
he &apos;s just standing still .
you wanna impress me ?
have him meow and ring the doorbell .
don &apos;t take it personally , chestnut .
those horses have had work done .
maybe you wanna take the cinch sack off before you meet peach .
no , it &apos;s snowing again and i &apos;m a penniless beggar .
i should look like one .
besides , she &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s a look .
all right , i know this one on one
with peach isn &apos;t your ideal scenario ,
but it &apos;s what &apos;s best for chestnut ,
so man up and face reality .
you &apos;re right .
and my friend , caroline channing ...
what is it ?
you might be ready to face reality ,
but are you ready to face reality tv ?
the place is crawling with peach clones
and tv cameras ready to meet you .
she totally set us up .
are you kidding me ?
fabulous , this is awesome , just awesome .
she &apos;s using the caroline channing freak show
to get herself on another freak show .
all right , you &apos;re right , let &apos;s go , you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , if i made chestnut parade around
and be humiliated in public ,
then i have to be willing to do the same .
here , hold my coat .
you always have those with you ?
yes , i &apos;m from manhattan .
okay , thank me for coming .
what ?
thank me for coming , that &apos;s what people did all the time
when i was a billionaire .
thank you for coming .
no , thank you for inviting me .
wow , that &apos;s so cool .
don &apos;t freak out .
i &apos;m about to get my rich on .
so when we go in there i &apos;ll introduce you ?
oh , you don &apos;t have to .
rich people always pretend
to know each other .
now open that door ,
and let &apos;s get my baby a home .
peach .
i wanna thank you for inviting me into your beautiful home
and showing me such kindness
during this very difficult , difficult time .
ladies , i would like you all to meet
my dear friend , caroline channing .
who , in light of her recent very difficult , difficult
financial troubles , has asked me to adopt her damaged pet horse
who was brought to my attention by my alcoholic servant , max .
right over there .
caroline ,
thank you for coming .
no , thank you for inviting me .
i &apos;m proud of you .
no , i &apos;m proud of you .
i just got the chills again .
oh , max , look at him .
he &apos;s smiling .
he likes this place .
yeah , it &apos;s almost worth you being humiliated on reality tv .
oh , i &apos;ll never be on that show .
i didn &apos;t sign the release .
what ?
old money don &apos;t sign .
you &apos;re gonna love it here , huh ?
aren &apos;t you gonna love it here ?
a nice big stable .
maybe i will , maybe i won &apos;t .
maybe i should come home and live with my best friend , max .
what about caroline ?
she can sleep under the tarp .
so i guess you found your weed .
no , this is just something we do when we &apos;re alone together .
it &apos;s kind of our thing .
you really love chestnut , don &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s all right .
he &apos;s no kitten .
okay , i &apos;ll see you soon , chestnut .
you want a minute alone ?
i &apos;ll be out front .
this is probably gonna seem ridiculous to you
because you &apos;re a horse and i &apos;m just some lady
that &apos;s been slipping you carrots for the last few months , but ...
i really got attached to you .
this is way more than most horses get out of me .
i wasn &apos;t even this upset when they discontinued tan m &amp; ms.
i , um ...
i really haven &apos;t had much go right for me in my life ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure things are gonna keep getting worse but ,
you were a good thing .
and when everything sucked ,
you were the best thing we had going .
and you &apos;re fuzzy too .
you &apos;re so fuzzy , and no one can argue
that touching a warm , fuzzy thing isn &apos;t straight up lovely .
so , thank you for everything you did for us , but ...
especially for being fuzzy .
max , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , i &apos;ll always be fine .
are you crying ?
yeah , i &apos;m crying ,
&apos;cause i wish i could live here .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll come visit ,
and we &apos;ll find a way to bring him home in the spring .
come on . i have a pocket full of dimes .
let &apos;s go get some convenience store taquitos
and wash &apos; em down with blue raspberry wine coolers .
they &apos;re on sale at the bodega .
two four packs for five dollars .
you know exactly what to say to cheer a broke sista up .
and when we get home , i found a video
of a kitten singing bruno mars .
