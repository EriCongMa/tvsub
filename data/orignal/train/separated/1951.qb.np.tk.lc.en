twins wasn &apos;t surprise enough ?

to see which one &apos;s gonna come out first .
okay , so you need to page , uh , karev 911 .
okay , let &apos;s get these babies out here .
dr. karev , ? i was told to come find you ?

no , i don &apos;t hate kids .
uh , what , then ?
just peds isn &apos;t my ? first choice as a specialty .
shouldn &apos;t have said that .
perfect . she gives me the one who hates kids .
thanks , mer .
all right , pick up whatever labs
i &apos;ve got pending and meet me in l &amp; d .
i don &apos;t hate kids .
you got it .
push , push , push , push , push .
? you got it , hon .
all right , we have a little girl .
okay , i &apos;m here .
we have a girl .
can we see her ?
no , there &apos;s another baby right behind her , okay ?
so , we just have to ...
hey , congratulations . i &apos;m dr. karev .
all right , here we go , laurie .
apgar &apos;s 6 .
baby &apos;s jaundiced ? and in respiratory distress .
all right , call the nicu .
tell them to have an umbilical line and vent on standby .
okay , laurie , push , push .
push , push . okay .
all right , and now you have little boy .
hey , you got him ?
yeah , i &apos;ll see you in c.t.
can we hold them ?
um , yeah , not just -- not just yet .
babies are looking a little jaundiced ,
so dr. karev &apos;s gonna take them up to the nicu
and see what might be going on .
laurie , you did great .
when did you find out ?
this morning .
how do you feel ?
like i want to puke .
what did alex say ?
i haven &apos;t talked to him yet .
you have to talk to him .
do i ?
it &apos;s not like i wanted this to happen .
jo , you have to talk to him .
i know .
the boy &apos;s in c.t. 2 .
come on , come on , come on .
got your labs . ? what are we dealing with ?
newborn twins . don &apos;t talk to deluca . he hates kids .
what do you have against kids ?
i don &apos;t hate kids .
scans up yet ?
no , they &apos;re coming .
deluca hates kids .
hurry up .
could be wrong .
we could be wrong .
about what ?
pull up the little girl &apos;s now .
for the record , i don &apos;t hate kids .
deluca , just shut your stupid mouth .
damn it .
damn it .
can you tell me what just happened ?
you see that ?
the boy has a tumor on his liver .
so does the girl -- same tumor .
both invading the kidneys , both causing early heart failure .
what happened is they have to go tell a mother and a father
that both of their newborn babies are dying .
both of them ?
they &apos;re just babies .
this has to be some kind of mistake .
they can &apos;t have cancer . you can &apos;t be born with cancer .
hepatoblastoma is ? a common liver cancer in kids .
it &apos;s also very aggressive .
the tumors are already causing problems
for your kids &apos; kidneys , hearts , and lungs .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m recommending liver transplants .
oh , god .
we asked not to see the ultrasound .
we didn &apos;t want to know the sex . we wanted to be surprised .
did -- did we -- - no , no .
laurie , this is not your fault .
your o.b. likely wouldn &apos;t have caught it .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
uh , just ...
what do we do now ?
the next step is that we get them
on the universal donor list , and we try to find them donors .
what about us ? c @-@ can we be donors ?
absolutely . we &apos;ll test you to see if you &apos;re a match .
yes , right now .
we want to .
warren , deluca , make that happen ,
and i &apos;ll see you down in the pit .
you should know that they are in very good hands .
dr. karev is amazing .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
do you want to have kids ?
i -- i don &apos;t , uh ... know .
uh , yeah .
i @-@ i , uh , do you -- now ?
or ever ?
i don &apos;t know , just is it something that you want ?
yeah , now ... or ever .
god , alex , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a simple yes @-@ or @-@ no question .
what the hell is going on ?
nothing .
i just ...
nothing .
you &apos;re a department head .
will you take a look at this contract for me
and tell me if anything looks weird to you .
sure .
there it is -- the face .
what face ?
maggie made a face , and now you &apos;re making a face .
what is it about my contract
that makes people make that face ?
you know what , i --
i don &apos;t like talking money with friends .
we &apos;re not talking money , callie .
are we talking money ? ?
i think ? they lowballed you a little .
a lot .
why do you think that ? ?
because i make a lot more than you .
yeah , like a lot more than you .
like -- like a lot more .
well , how much ?
meredith .
give me a number .
i just think , like , can &apos;t you just be civil and rational ?
but she won &apos;t listen to anything i have to say .
now she &apos;s decided that this is the hill
that she &apos;s got to die on .
of course that hill is my living room , so ...
yeah , look , um , yeah , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m with robbins today ,
and karev has these twins , so i need --
oh , yeah . yeah , yeah , no , go .
okay .
yeah .
hey , look .
uh ... if , you know -- if you need to get out of there
or need a couch to crash on --
oh , no , no . not a chance .
thanks , but no . she &apos;s out tonight .
&apos;cause i mean , if i leave , she wins .
you know , she does not win my living room .
see ?
i mean , that &apos;s not civil , right ?
little girl &apos;s going into renal failure .
boy &apos;s lungs are crapping out fast .
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky and the parents will be a match .
jo hit me up about having kids today
out of absolutely nowhere .
is that what happens ?
you shack up , and then suddenly
your ovaries go into overdrive ?
aw , i think you &apos;ll be a good dad .
your babies will be so foul @-@ mouthed and dirty and cute .
i just didn &apos;t think we were there yet .
i don &apos;t know if i am .
definitely didn &apos;t think she was .
alex .
what ?
what if you &apos;re already there ?
w @-@ what if she &apos;s asking &apos; cause she &apos;s already knocked up ,
and she &apos;s just testing the waters ?
why would you even say that ?
we tested the parents . the results are back .
mason , you are a match to do a directed donation .
thank god .
okay .
that &apos;s good , right ?
why don &apos;t you look like that &apos;s good news ?
um , laurie ...
i &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re not a viable candidate .
uh , we still have one .
i &apos;ll split it .
i &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t .
the lobe of your liver that we have to take is --
we &apos;ll need two donors .
wait .
what happens if we don &apos;t find one ?
one of the babies dies ?
we &apos;re talking to unos , and we &apos;re hoping --
i don &apos;t want to hope .
i want to know that i won &apos;t have to choose between my babies .
laurie , shh , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not okay .
don &apos;t tell me that it &apos;s okay .
at least there &apos;s something that you can do .
it &apos;s not your fault . look , we have one .
let &apos;s just be grateful that we have one .
i know it &apos;s not my fault .
you wanted to be surprised .
you didn &apos;t want to know the sex .
okay , they said it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference --
well , maybe it would have !
maybe there was something that i could have done and --
i am their mother ,
and i can &apos;t do anything to help them .
stop yelling at me for being able to .
it &apos;s not my fault .
well , then , you decide , mason .
you tell these doctors which one
of our children has to die because --
you &apos;re not deciding . i am .
you can &apos;t make a decision like this .
you shouldn &apos;t have to . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;ll evaluate , i decide .
the baby that i see is stronger , is doing better ,
has the better chance to thrive will get the donation .
and the other one ?
will get the next one .
and we will do everything that we can to find it .
and the rest you put on me .
uh , bailey did you like this ?
i mean , who knew bailey was the man ?
mm , you know what ? they lowballed you
&apos;cause you &apos;re an in @-@ house hire .
they knew you wouldn &apos;t push back .
i thought the offer was fair .
i mean , for me , it wasn &apos;t about the money .
bailey said she needed me . the job just fell in my lap .
no , you earned that job , okay ?
you need to go back and renegotiate .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s too late .
i already accepted the offer .
no , walk in there ? and demand what you deserve .
men do it all the time .
they walk in , ? they adjust their man parts ,
they get more money .
yeah , we all did it .
i did it real good . i mean , i got --
i make a lot more than you .
i know . you said that !
okay , so , i mean , what &apos;s the worst they can say ? no ?
i mean , i &apos;d just go back to my old job .
ay , no .
you can &apos;t go back .
you &apos;d have to move to another hospital .
maybe another state .
maggie , what do you think ?
uh , don &apos;t ask me .
i make terrible choices . i can &apos;t be trusted .
i could be having sex right now .
what ?
six months of my life dating that man .
six months -- that is an investment .
what ?
he was nice .
ethan .
he was funny , he was cute , he was sexy .
he was sexy , right ?
mm , very .
he was .
sweet ass .
no idea .
empirically sexy .
and the sex -- i mean ...
first prize in the talent competition
and the long jump , if you know what i &apos;m saying .
but , you know , he -- he spit
just a little bit when he talked ,
and he said &quot; all @-@ timers &quot; instead of alzheimer &apos;s .
and i got bored .
and i slid away . i let it fizzle out .
and then within another six months ,
he finds someone else
he &apos;s ready to spend the rest of his life with ?
i get that . that can happen .
i make terrible choices .
i leave things behind and just let the bridges burn .
i did it with ethan . i did it with dean .
oh , my god .
i did it with my entire life .
one day , i chose to learn
a little bit about my birth mother .
cut to i live in her house with her daughter ,
and i work with the kind stranger who fathered me ,
and i left behind an entire life
and family that no longer exists .
my parents are divorced .
my childhood home is sold .
my mother is in hawaii making soups now .
i -- i have no home .
it &apos;s like i @-@ i flew to this planet
on an exploratory mission ,
and the earth blew up behind me
and i can &apos;t go back .
and now i &apos;m here with you aliens .
except i &apos;m the alien , and i &apos;m all alone ,
and i have nothing , and no one wants me .
that ...
you got us . we want you .
i can &apos;t have sex with you .
no . ?
you &apos;re a cylon .
this is &quot; galactica . &quot;
i really do like her .
she make me not the crazy sister .
what do you think they &apos;re paying her ?
why are you doing that ?
because people eat dinner .
not people who are moving out .
april , you &apos;re supposed to be packing .
i &apos;m not leaving because i told you i &apos;m not giving up .
if you want to trade nights on the couch , we can do that .
but i &apos;m not moving out of my home .
it &apos;s my home . it &apos;s my --
oh , i hate that you are forcing me to say this stuff .
april , okay , ? it &apos;s my name on the lease .
it &apos;s my place . ? you moved in , and you moved out .
no , i didn &apos;t move out .
i went away , and then i came back .
and i am sorry .
i am truly sorry ? that i wasn &apos;t here for you ,
but i thought if we had some space --
i need space now !
you see ?
right now , i really just wanted
to have my burrito and go to sleep .
save it . i made dinner .
what is it -- boiled bunny ?
&apos;cause you sound crazy .
okay , i feel like a hostage .
but like a reverse hostage where the kidnapper
just follows me everywhere and won &apos;t leave my damn house .
you know what they call that ?
marriage .
and it gets hard , but you don &apos;t just leave .
you don &apos;t just stop .
you do . you do just stop .
you know what they call that ? divorce .
what ?
tomorrow morning , when you go to work ,
i &apos;m having the locks changed .
yeah , tomorrow night when i get home from work ,
i &apos;m bringing a crowbar !
listen to yourself .
two babies , two tumors , one liver .
how &apos;s karev supposed to make a call like that ?
well , first ,
he &apos;ll try to avoid having to make the call at all .
he &apos;ll try to find another donor .
call unos every 20 minutes until they have something .
he &apos;ll bug unos ...
and call every hospital , their transplant teams ...
... comb the hospital ,
every hospital in seattle for a matching liver .
then he &apos;ll do a physical evaluation of each baby
to look for any other malformations --
see which one seems healthier overall .
then he &apos;ll do a full lab work @-@ up ,
go over and over the results ,
look for any other possible co @-@ existing problems ,
like a kidney disease or heart anomalies .
at -- at this point , he &apos;s hoping to find something wrong .
hey . i &apos;m here .
and if he &apos;s smart ,
he &apos;s got someone ? double checking his work .
and then it &apos;s down ? to the tumors themselves .
what &apos;s the distance of the tumor from the cantlie line ?
8 millimeters .
yeah , i know i just called , but this infant
is on a timeframe , so if you just --
yes , i &apos;ll hold .
check and recheck every scan .
see if they involve more than one lobe .
if there &apos;s infiltration of other structures .
you just don &apos;t give up until you find your answer .
how can i help ?
? take a look at the labs again .
we &apos;re screwed . the labs are the same .
the staging is the same .
both tumors ? are causing renal failure .
look , what about the measurements .
the girl &apos;s tumor &apos;s bigger .
the boy &apos;s is smaller ,
but it &apos;s invading the left hepatic vein .
one &apos;s too big , ? the other one &apos;s too complicated .
it &apos;s a dead freaking heat .
you need food and a shower and sleep .
you need to walk away for a minute .
i &apos;m serious .
let &apos;s go . go .
try unos again .
yeah .
all nighter ?
yeah .
and i need to go back .
i just , uh -- i just need a couple hours &apos; sleep .
can we talk ?
yeah .
okay , yeah .
a @-@ are you -- - i found this ...
when i was unpacking -- i , uh , wasn &apos;t snooping .
i know it &apos;s kind of none of my business , but ...
i picked it up .
and then i just couldn &apos;t put it down .
oh , okay , this .
you have babies ?
no , no , these are embryos .
with izzie ?
listen , izzie wanted to freeze her eggs .
she needed them fertilized . i did it ,
she froze them . that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s all ?
yeah , then she left me .
that &apos;s all . you can toss it .
so , you wanted to have babies with her ?
yeah , i -- i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know .
i mean , that was -- that was a hundred years ago .
i &apos;m just asking because when i asked you
if you wanted to move in with me ,
you said that you did
and that you could picture a life with me ,
but you never said anything about babies .
you said , ? &quot; maybe we could get a dog . &quot;
do you want a dog ?
no , i want to know what we &apos;re doing here .
i love you , and you love me .
i know , but when i look ahead --
why are we looking ahead ?
if you had or maybe ? you do have , for all i know ,
a bunch of izzie babies walking around with your face on them --
and why are we doing it now ?
and -- and i &apos;m just ? the &quot; let &apos;s get a dog &quot; girl ?
i &apos;m wondering what you think we are , what you want .
look , i didn &apos;t have babies with izzie .
my role in that whole thing was with a cup and a magazine .
but you would have .
you wanted to .
she was worth it to you .
but when i ask you ? if you want to have babies ,
you &apos;re all , &quot; i don &apos;t know , yes , no , maybe , uh ... &quot;
she was my wife .
we were married .
that &apos;s my point .
what am i ?
she had cancer .
she didn &apos;t even know if
she was gonna be able to after the radiation .
no , don &apos;t do -- what , i have to get sick
to figure out if you &apos;re gonna go all in with me ?
and now you &apos;re gonna go .
yes .
and you &apos;re right -- it &apos;s kind of none of your business .
and i &apos;m not doing this !
i &apos;m not talking about babies that i didn &apos;t have with izzie
or may or may not have with you .
i have two real babies i &apos;m responsible for
at the hospital right now .
i have enough kids to take care of .
how did you negotiate your contract ?
what ?
i mean , what did they offer ?
you were coming from private practice ,
so you had a salary you could leverage .
how much was that ?
mer , stop it .
well , just tell me . i won &apos;t tell anyone .
if one of your kids had to die ,
which one would you choose and why ?
well , bailey because he kept me up all night .
but ask me tomorrow , it might be zola .
why ? what &apos;s -- what &apos;s going on ?
i have two newborns who need a liver transplant
and one liver .
the other one won &apos;t survive until tomorrow .
well , you have to run all the tests .
yeah , every test is a tie .
there &apos;s no medical question anymore , mer .
they &apos;re just kids now , and i got to decide
whether the boy lives or the girl lives .
i mean , alex , you really have to trust your instincts .
i don &apos;t know , mer .
if i was one of these kids , with my family ,
where i came from , ? i wouldn &apos;t have bet on me .
i -- i would have looked in my crystal ball
and seen a druggie or a burnout or --
i would not have seen me as the guy who make the decisions .
i would not have seen that coming .
i mean , what if one of them becomes a serial killer ,
the other one &apos;s gonna cure alzheimer &apos;s ?
that &apos;s not your problem .
i mean , it &apos;s just like raising your own kids .
they &apos;re gonna be who they are .
we just have to try to give them the best shot we can .
the twins &apos; lungs are filling with fluid .
you &apos;re out of time .
screw it . i &apos;m not making this call .
if there &apos;s a decision to be made
about withdrawing care from an infant , bailey can do it .
she &apos;s the chief . she can do it , not me .
no , no , hey , no , no , alex . what are you doing ?
i have been watching you .
i have been in awe of you stepping up for these babies ,
for these parents in a way that --
do you remember the first time we ever talked ?
really talked .
we were on a plane , and we just picked up
a transplant organ from a kid who died ,
and you were upset and pissy
because you thought that i didn &apos;t care .
but i thought ,
this guy could do it .
he cares enough about this work .
this guy has it .
and i knew that day , alex .
and today ...
... i have been so proud of you .
and so now you can &apos;t -- you can &apos;t hand it over
to somebody else because they &apos;re yours ,
and they need you , and you can do it .
and you have to because if you give it to bailey ,
you won &apos;t be able to look
at yourself in the mirror . i promise you .
you &apos;ll always wonder what kind of doctor you could be .
this is the job , alex ,
and it &apos;s why you get paid the big bucks .
mason , this is dr. bailey .
i &apos;ve asked her ? to perform your operation
to remove the lobe ? of your liver for donation .
and who will get it ?
well , the test and the scans were inconclusive .
i need to open up both babies .
i need to see both tumors up close .
and then i &apos;ll decide .
you have to ?
in order to make the best choice ,
the right choice , or we risk losing them both .
and we &apos;re racing the clock , so i need to take them now .
wait , wait ! ? we -- they don &apos;t have names .
we &apos;re not letting them go before we name them .
she looks like an emma .
she does . ?
hi , emma .
daniel .
daniel .
emma and daniel .
what do you have against kids anyway ?
god , nothing !
okay , i don &apos;t hate kids .
it &apos;s not the kids -- it &apos;s the parents .
all right ?
i was an e.m.t. right out of high school .
i loved it .
it &apos;s why i went to med school .
my second call out , it &apos;s an mvc .
a woman &apos;s in the front seat bleeding from neck lac .
and she &apos;s holding her little toddler , who is d.o.a.
she wouldn &apos;t let him go .
and i &apos;m trying to stop her from bleeding ,
but she just held on .
and cried .
and the sound she made --
i thought she &apos;s gonna cry like this for the rest of her life .
so , i decided right there , no peds for me .
and not because of the kids .
i don &apos;t want that responsibility over a parent .
and , yeah , maybe that -- maybe that makes me a lousy doctor ,
or maybe ? i &apos;m just not strong enough .
but ...
i get to decide what i &apos;m best suited for .
right ?
i mean , don &apos;t i get to decide what kind of doctor i &apos;m gonna be ?
yeah , you do .
you have to .
15 blade , please .
scalpel .
and 10 blade .
push bovie to 30 . more lap pads .
that &apos;s what i needed to see .
all right , hold on , don &apos;t move .
i need ? a little more retraction .
good . hold right there .
do you see where she &apos;s got ...
wait , yeah .
yeah .
what do you think ?
okay .
it &apos;s emma .
the liver &apos;s going to emma .
all right , there you go .
but i need you to do the transplant for me .
i want to try a primary resection on daniel
and see if can save the liver he already has --
you don &apos;t give them something to run from .
at least buy him more time .
alex .
i want to save them both .
but can the child even withstand ?
probably not -- i mean , de @-@ sating on me ,
and i &apos;ve already maxed out meds , but i swear ,
if don &apos;t try , he &apos;ll be dead by tonight .
i want to try .
suction . retract here .
hey , karev &apos;s throwing a hail mary .
suction .
why you furrowing your brow at me ?
i would think that you of all people --
this hospital &apos;s first female chief of surgery --
would fight for a woman to get paid
at least as much as any man .
this is about meredith grey .
i mean , if you do not value her enough , then just --
it is inappropriate for me to discuss
the salary of another employee .
she deserves more , and you know it .
i do , and don &apos;t ever suggest to me that i do not stand
in sisterhood with other women in this hospital .
you &apos;ve never been 4 &apos; 11 &quot; tall and overlooked
and called &quot; girl &quot; by your male colleagues .
you don &apos;t know . i am woman .
hear me roar .
but i &apos;ve already mentored grey .
i &apos;ve already taught her what she needs to know .
and now that i &apos;m chief of this hospital ,
it &apos;s not my fault if she &apos;s not used
the skills that i taught her .
and it &apos;s not my job to be giving away money
when it &apos;s not asked for .
you have coddled her .
y @-@ y-- since derek , you have coddled her ,
and i won &apos;t do that .
no , she needs to rise .
and she needs to rise on her own
so she knows she can rise on her own .
because ...
you may not be here the next time she falls .
she needs to fight for herself .
okay .
this is what ? a feminist looks like , sir .
oh , how &apos;s the little girl ?
good . she &apos;s back in the nicu .
perfect anastomosis , and her kidneys have already bounced back .
but how &apos;s he doing ?
that &apos;s a good resection margin , right ?
yeah .
i see you got most of it .
it &apos;s decent , it &apos;s just really close --
i just need to get this last --
suction . suction .
hepatic vein &apos;s leaking . clamp .
another clamp .
no , no , come on .
was it a bad call trying to resect ?
no .
no .
it was the right call , just a bold one .
yeah , this would have happened during his transplant surgery .
karev chose the right twin .
another clamp .
got it .
you did it ?
you did it.what ?
damn it , he &apos;s arresting .
push .02 of epi and another 50cc of blood .
come on , buddy .
b.p. &apos; s dropping . persistent bradycardia .
try it .08 to the et tube .
come on , we &apos;re losing him .
but you had him .
he won &apos;t get him back .
no , he won &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna close . stapler .
but you &apos;ve got a rhythm .
those are agonal beats . they won &apos;t last .
so , what do we do ? ? just push more epi , right ?
he &apos;s maxed out on epi . his heart &apos;s too weak .
no , you can &apos;t just stop , okay -- what else ?
there &apos;s nothing else .
nothing to do but wait .
oh , alex .
you have a beautiful baby girl .
the transplant went very well .
she &apos;s now recovering very , very smoothly .
laurie , we did everything we could to save your boy .
no .
despite our best efforts , the tumor was just ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
what is it , grey ?
we need to talk about my contract .
you said i deserved to be your chief of general ,
that i made your job easier .
i was happy . i was grateful .
that doesn &apos;t change the fact that i earned this job ,
and i worked very hard for it .
i need to feel as valued as you say you value me .
i need to be able to look in the mirror .
this is just not enough .
do you have number in mind ?
yes .
i can make that happen .
is that all , grey ?
yep . that &apos;s it .
okay , thanks .
grey ?
yeah .
well done .
dr. karev .
you pooped ?
i pooped !
let &apos;s get you out of here .
yes !
thank you for not changing the locks .
things got a little crazy last night .
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;m being a little crazy .
but is it really crazy to try like hell to save
the one thing in the world that matters most to you ?
i love you , and if fighting for y--
when you &apos;re faced with the tough choices ,
it comes down to you .
what can you live with ?
what can you leave behind ?
towels are in the bathroom .
anything else you need ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m fine , thank you .
okay .
it &apos;s only for one night .
he shouldn &apos;t have to sleep in a hotel . it &apos;s --
two more , please .
you got it .
here you go .
dr. pierce , um ... i &apos;m off shift .
just having a quick one before i head home .
it &apos;s fine .
i have no home .
my planet exploded .
you know , i don &apos;t hate kids .
i just ...
another round ?
... hate it when they die .
we have that in common .
hey , can i ask you something ?
did you ever wonder why people should trust us
to just decide , like ,
the most important questions of their lives ?
i mean , you &apos;re just a person just like them , right ?
but suddenly , you &apos;re given this
incredible responsibility to just --
you have really pretty eyes .
uh ... thank you .
right or wrong -- you have to decide ...
... what you &apos;re willing to go down fighting for .
you okay ?
yeah .
look , about last night .
no , you said it &apos;s none of my business , so ... it &apos;s ...
well , it &apos;s not ... and it is .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i get mad , and -- and you get squirrely .
i do not ...
no , you get squirrely when someone says
they &apos;re gonna be there , and then you think maybe they won &apos;t .
that happens . you &apos;re allowed .
okay .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
and if -- if ...
having a kid is what you want ,
then ... i can be ready .
i &apos;m ready .
i mean let &apos;s do it .
let &apos;s make a baby right now .
are you out of your mind ?
we &apos;re not having a baby .
i &apos;m in the middle of a residency .
you are never home .
and what about us ? ? we -- we haven &apos;t even traveled .
and what happened to the dog ? let &apos;s get a dog .
no , do not come near me .
we are not making a baby .
no .
ruff .
the choice is yours .
