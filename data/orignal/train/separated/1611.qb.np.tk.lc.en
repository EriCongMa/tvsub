i &apos;m kind of worried about jesus .
he found our birth dad . the guy &apos;s a sex offender .
与未成年发生猥亵下流行为
he &apos;s on that list because of me .
i was 15 , he was 18 .
he showed up at my work site like this .
you have got to keep your son away from me .
why are you sending connor away ?
connor asked to go live with his mom .
mommy !
brandon , this is eddie , mason &apos;s father .
we got all the plants and materials donated
thanks to monte !
she &apos;s an incredible young woman , isn &apos;t she ?
monte kissed me .
why can &apos;t we have two parties ?
jesus ...
hey , look who i found .
thought i could drive you to school .
hey , bubba , i went ahead and printed out your train ticket to la .
awesome , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
and i &apos;ve gotta go , early meeting .
good luck .
thank you .
how happy are you ?
someone &apos;s gonna see his boyfriend .
i &apos;m super happy .
it just sucks that i &apos;m gonna miss your party .
what &apos;s to miss ?
hey !
he &apos;s just pouting
because we can &apos;t afford to rent a skate park for his birthday .
hey , if it wasn &apos;t connor &apos;s homecoming ,
i &apos;d go a different weekend .
you haven &apos;t seen him in forever . totally forgiven .
yeah , we &apos;ll have a family dinner when you get home , babe .
hey , you wanna use the warehouse ?
for what ?
the skate park .
really ?
yeah .
you can build some ramps out of plywood and stuff .
what ... wait , no .
i &apos;m using the warehouse to rehearse r &amp; j ,
and i already got the downstairs taped off ...
and it wouldn &apos;t cost you anything .
yeah ? and your folks would be okay with that ?
oh , 100 percent . dad &apos;s just stoked someone &apos;s actually using it .
what about my dance party ?
no , this is my year .
well , we can do both .
i mean , we can turn the first floor into the skate park ,
and we can do your dance party upstairs .
but the sets are upstairs .
happy ?
uh , no .
yeah .
all right . i will allow it .
but everyone has to be super careful around the sets .
how many people can we invite ?
not too many .
i was just planning on ordering some pizza
and inviting like , five or six dudes , you know ?
no girls , no drama .
sexist much ?
look , i &apos;m just trying to avoid quinceañera : the sequel .
hey , that &apos;s my phone .
what ?
uh , nothing . you just ... you got a text from connor .
looks like someone &apos;s pretty excited
to see you this weekend , huh ?
okay , you guys all need to get off !
let &apos;s go ! look at the time !
hey , callie .
um , is a.j. , uh ... is he coming to the party ?
i don &apos;t know . i think mariana &apos;s inviting him .
okay .
are you bringing ...
cort ? oh , no . i &apos;m not inviting her .
i thought it &apos;d be uncomfortable .
yeah . i get it .
i mean , we &apos;re gonna have to get used to
seeing each other with other people , right ?
do we ?
i mean , i , um ...
i saw you and a.j. kissing out back .
i was in the garage .
don &apos;t feel weird or anything .
i just think it &apos;d be better you know , if ...
if we didn &apos;t bring other people home or to family stuff .
yeah , okay .
okay .
so , sally benton came to see me yesterday .
oh , well , if she &apos;s upset that
we &apos;re letting brandon do romeo and juliet off @-@ campus ,
she &apos;s just gonna have to get over it .
no , well , she was upset ,
but it wasn &apos;t about that .
she &apos;s upset because she ... she said that you kissed her .
you didn &apos;t kiss her , did you ?
no , i didn &apos;t kiss a student .
however , sally tried to kiss me .
what ? why ?
i have no idea , lena .
maybe she misinterpreted my interest in her
as a mentor as something else .
considering our history ,
i can only imagine what you &apos;re thinking .
why didn &apos;t you report this ?
oh , i made it very clear
what she did was inappropriate and unwelcome ,
and i didn &apos;t see the need to embarrass her any further .
what were you thinking ?
you know that any indiscretion
between a student and a teacher or administrator
has to be reported to the school board immediately .
sally &apos;s 18 , so there &apos;s no legal issue .
there &apos;s no obligation to inform her parents .
what about the ethical issue ?
i was considering the ethical issue
by choosing not to humiliate the girl .
frankly , i know how that feels .
why is she saying that you kissed her ?
maybe she thought i &apos;d tell her parents .
well , she told her parents .
so we are going to have to deal with this
even if she is 18 .
have you ever had sex ?
uh , well , yeah .
are you asking &apos; cause of that text from connor ?
were you guys , you know , thinking about hooking up this weekend ?
i wasn &apos;t .
but what , you thought ... you think maybe connor was ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s thinking .
how did you , like , learn how to do stuff ?
like everybody else . porn online .
right .
so , i mean ,
if you need to do some research ,
or have a little bit of jude time ...
put a hat on the door ?
no . no , that &apos;s my thing .
uh , here .
from now on , sock on the door
means keep out , jude time .
you want us to write a letter
supporting the man who got you pregnant and addicted to drugs ?
now i know why you wanted to just meet me ,
and not papa .
i thought he &apos;d hear it better from you .
you &apos;re home now . and you &apos;re doing so well .
i don &apos;t understand
why you would want to open up all these old wounds .
helping gabe was my idea .
why ?
because i think ...
i think it would mean a lot to jesus ,
just like it meant a lot for me to get to know ana ,
to have that chance , at least .
but he can &apos;t as long as gabe is on that registry ,
because , legally , gabe can &apos;t even be around minors .
or live within 500 feet of a school .
and you know how hard it is to get a job when you &apos;re on that list ?
he doesn &apos;t deserve it , mama .
he was an adult .
he knew what he was doing .
he was 18 .
and we were in love .
and it was consensual .
did gabe put you up to this ?
no , he ...
he doesn &apos;t even know we &apos;re having this conversation .
so how do you even know he wants your help ?
what about your mothers ?
they approve of you involving yourself in this ?
my moms believe in second chances .
you know , like the one we all gave ana .
so you &apos;ll talk to papa ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s just mike &apos;s gonna be home soon , so i should probably go .
uh , okay .
i guess i &apos;ll see you at the party .
oh , you &apos;re gonna go ?
um , listen ,
you totally don &apos;t have to ,
you know , if you &apos;re busy or whatever .
it &apos;s probably gonna be lame .
lame ?
not according to mariana &apos;s e @-@ vite .
a skate park and a dance party ?
that sounds cool to me .
so , you &apos;re like , an amazing skater , or something ?
nah .
but i do know my way around a dance floor .
plus , it &apos;ll give me a chance to show you my moves .
unless you &apos;re not interested in seeing my moves ?
oh , i am interested .
good .
but if you wanna keep up , you better brush up on yours .
hey , i should get back .
my break was over , like , ten minutes ago .
wait , maybe you could , like , take a night off ?
we could , like , go on a real date .
well , i &apos;m working the early shift tomorrow ,
and eddie &apos;s supposed to have mason .
tomorrow i have a family thing that i have to get to .
but maybe i could come over after ?
i kind of have this rule about bringing guys home .
you know , &apos; cause of mason .
i &apos;m just not that mom .
yeah , no . i mean , totally .
i respect that .
but won &apos;t mason be with his dad ?
well , yeah , but ...
my place is kind of a mood killer .
i mean , tripping over building blocks and sippy cups ?
not hot .
right . right .
um , well , you know , the party won &apos;t actually be at the house .
so , no one &apos;s gonna be home .
maybe i could sneak away a little early .
we could hang out there .
are you sure ?
yeah , it &apos;s gonna be like , a typical high school party anyway .
and i &apos;m so over that .
of course you are . you &apos;re very mature .
oh , i am very mature .
monte created this situation
where she could be alone with this girl .
you know , a girl that you claim she builds up ,
gives special treatment ,
which is classic grooming behavior .
i &apos;m just ...
just saying how well do you really , really know monte ?
come in .
do you , uh ...
can you guys get a refund on the train ticket ?
why ?
oh , well , i don &apos;t wanna miss the party .
but isn &apos;t connor &apos;s homecoming this weekend ?
uh , yeah , but he has football .
so , i &apos;d just be sitting in the bleachers bored .
i can go another time . if that &apos;s cool .
something happen ?
no . no .
all right .
well , if you &apos;re sure about it , we &apos;ll see what we can do .
and if we , you know , can &apos;t get a refund , i can ...
do chores or something to pay you guys back .
okay . thank you .
first , let me assure you that we are taking this very seriously ,
and i want to be as sensitive to sally as possible .
the protocol in a situation like this
is to bring principal porter and sally
in front of the school board , separately of course ,
to tell their sides of the story .
what do you mean &quot; sides of the story &quot; ?
what is ms. porter saying happened ?
she is saying that sally initiated the kiss ,
a kiss that she refused .
that &apos;s not true .
our daughter has a boyfriend .
and , might i add , ms. porter is a self @-@ described bisexual .
where did you get that idea ?
sally found ms. porter &apos;s profile on some dating website
soliciting men and women .
the term is &quot; seeking , &quot; not &quot; soliciting . &quot;
whatever the case ,
our daughter &apos;s not going in front of any board .
incidents like these follow people ,
and sally has worked too hard
to have her reputation called into question .
i &apos;m sorry if sally &apos;s not willing to tell her story .
i &apos;m not exactly sure how you want us to handle this .
we &apos;d like to see ms. porter fired .
she can &apos;t be fired without documented cause .
well , i &apos;d try to find a cause if i were you ,
before you allow her to ruin the reputation of this school .
in the meantime , make sure she stays away from our daughter .
sally .
do you remember me ?
uh , yeah , of course .
what about me ?
tried to get off the list a few years back .
you know , didn &apos;t happen .
talked to a lawyer , she said it was almost impossible .
impossible if you don &apos;t have a letter of support from the ...
from ana and her parents ,
the people who called the cops on you in the first place .
your folks are willing to do that ?
i think they will be .
so you haven &apos;t asked them ?
they &apos;re thinking about it .
but i can be very persuasive .
everyone thinks i should be a lawyer one day .
well , i mean , i ...
i don &apos;t have money for one now , so ...
you don &apos;t need one .
all you have to do is fill
out this petition for a pardon and submit it
along with the letters of support from ana and her parents .
why are you doing all this ?
you know , trying to get me off the list ?
does there have to be a reason ?
can i think about it ?
sure . whatever you want .
oh , um , i have to go .
it &apos;s my birthday ... or our birthday .
oh , i ...
uh , happy birthday .
thanks .
ana ?
i think i &apos;m gonna stick around for a bit , to catch up .
right . so then i &apos;ll see you tonight at the party ?
uh , hey , tell jesus happy birthday .
sure . i &apos;ll do that .
so ...
ha . yeah .
um , can i get you one ?
nick did all this ? really ?
i know , right . he &apos;s major .
oh my god , you so have it bad for him .
what about matt ?
matt who ?
there &apos;s only one problem .
i haven &apos;t gotten a second alone with nick .
he &apos;s been too busy bro @-@ ing out downstairs with jesus .
i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
look at you .
everything okay ?
yeah , great .
come on . come on .
oh , my god !
um , sorry , you invited sally benton ?
after she got r &amp; j thrown off campus ?
brandon , we can &apos;t be petty .
i still have to work with her on honor board .
plus , she &apos;s like , really popular .
if i didn &apos;t invite her , like ,
none of the senior girls would &apos;ve come .
there she is !
hi !
happy birthday !
wow . sally benton &apos;s here .
well , monte sure does have a type , doesn &apos;t she ?
still think sally initiated that kiss ?
i ... i don &apos;t know .
you having fun ?
yeah .
where &apos;s jude ?
um , upstairs , i think .
i don &apos;t know why he decided not to go to la
so he could just sit in the corner by himself .
what ?
oh , i just ... i might have an idea .
uh , he got this picture from connor .
what kind of picture ?
okay ! um , what , he told you about it ?
no , i sort of accidentally intercepted it .
and i think it freaked him out a little .
&apos;cause he asked me where i learned to , you know , &quot; do it . &quot;
and what &apos;d you say ?
porn .
what ?
ahem . attention , skater boys .
if you &apos;re tired of playing with your half @-@ pipe ,
i suggest you make your way
up here for some real bumpin &apos; and grindin &apos; .
oh , what ?
wait , that &apos;s all it takes ?
you guys are weak , come on !
yo , seriously , you remember when this was just a skate party
with like five dudes and some pizza ?
yeah , me neither .
dude , it &apos;s mariana &apos;s birthday , too .
and she &apos;s kind of my girlfriend . i can &apos;t just leave her hanging .
fine .
fine .
hey , thanks , man .
yeah .
are you ready for some dancing ?
come on .
uh @-@ uh .
mmm , cupcakes are delicious , victor .
thank you .
mariana couldn &apos;t stop sampling
them when she worked with us at the bakery .
i bet .
she &apos;s a good girl .
you &apos;ve done so well by her and jesus .
thank you , victor .
but do you really think
helping gabe get off this sex offender registry
is a good idea ?
i &apos;m sorry , who &apos;s helping gabe ?
mariana .
why aren &apos;t you dancing ?
i don &apos;t really have anyone to dance with .
you can dance with me .
shouldn &apos;t you be dancing with a.j. ?
um , i &apos;m sort of avoiding him .
why ?
um , i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s something you want to hear about .
how do you know ?
okay . um ...
i think he wants to have sex .
i told you .
no , it &apos;s okay .
do you want to ?
i &apos;m not sure .
are you like , nervous
that you won &apos;t know what to do ?
totally .
yeah , i actually went online to look at ...
pornography ?
yeah . you ever ...
yeah . of course .
what &apos;d you think ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
what about you ?
i mean , it kind of freaked me out .
it &apos;s so aggressive and impersonal .
you know , and of course they &apos;re acting .
they probably don &apos;t even know each other .
sex isn &apos;t like that with someone you love and trust .
i mean , so i &apos;m told .
do you love a.j. ?
not like you love connor .
but even if you do love someone ,
you still don &apos;t have to do anything you &apos;re not ready for .
then why can &apos;t you tell a.j. that ?
yup . no , you &apos;re right . i should .
just tell him how i feel .
did jesus say anything to you ?
no , when do i ever talk to jesus ?
20分钟以后在我家见
hey , uh , so you know ,
i think i &apos;m gonna go home early , if that &apos;s okay .
why ? what &apos;s the matter ?
uh , i just ... my stomach &apos;s not ... it &apos;s feeling a little weird .
so , i might just go home .
okay . well , if you feel better ,
we &apos;re doing presents later at home .
okay . yeah , uh , i &apos;ll rally .
okay .
there you are .
i &apos;m gonna go get some punch .
am i being paranoid , or are you dodging me ?
no , i just ... my family &apos;s here .
i &apos;m not that into pda .
well , we could always go someplace your family isn &apos;t .
like where ?
like your house ?
i can &apos;t just leave .
why not ?
look , i &apos;m gonna take a swing and say that jesus won &apos;t mind ,
and no offense , but you think mariana &apos;s gonna even notice ?
okay . let &apos;s go .
tired of dancing ?
uh , no , just taking a break .
yeah , actually , i should probably go soon .
already ?
yeah . i have a paper due monday .
leaving a party to go do homework .
your parents expect a lot from you , huh ?
they just want me to succeed .
but still , you must feel a lot of pressure
not to disappoint them .
i guess .
the thing is ,
being who you think your parents want you to be
makes it kinda hard to be who you really are .
you have a right to be yourself , to be proud .
you don &apos;t need to feel ashamed .
you know , it occurred to me
that for you to have found monte &apos;s dating profile
like your parents said ,
you must have been registered on the site yourself .
and for her profile to come up ,
you must have been searching as a woman looking for women .
please , don &apos;t tell my mom .
monte &apos;s career is at stake ,
her reputation , sally .
this lie could ruin her life .
oh , um , i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , we ever gonna dance through an entire song ?
sorry . two seconds .
hey , ana .
so , how was it ? how &apos;d it go with gabe ?
fine .
fine ?
great .
hey , hey , hey . this is silly , honey .
come back and join the rest of us .
why ?
so mariana can brag about her party being better ?
no way .
yeah , i knew she &apos;d get what she wanted , like always .
mariana may know how to get what she wants ,
but she &apos;s got your back .
she does , seriously .
she &apos;s trying to help gabe
get off the sex offender registry for you .
why ?
well , i haven &apos;t asked her yet ,
but i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s because she thinks if he &apos;s off the list ,
you guys can maybe get to know each other a little bit better .
yeah , but he doesn &apos;t want anything to do with me .
you were- you were about eight when you asked me , um ...
how many people someone was allowed to marry
because you wanted mama and me to marry a man .
and i said , &quot; well , sweetheart ,
you &apos;re only allowed to marry one person . &quot;
and i asked you if you thought
maybe there was something that you needed from a dad
that maybe we could help make happen .
what &apos;d i say ?
nothing .
i think it &apos;s hard to know
what you want from something
if you &apos;ve never really had it .
but it &apos;s okay to be curious , jesus , it is .
gabe liked me until he knew i was his son .
that must ... that must hurt .
you think ...
you think if he got off that list he &apos;d wanna know me ?
i honestly don &apos;t know . but my main concern right now , my love ,
is making sure that you have enough self @-@ esteem
and enough love from mama and me
to handle this better than you have been .
okay ?
come on . let &apos;s go cut a rug .
that &apos;s old speak for &quot; dance . &quot;
whatever you kids do these days .
hey , you know i love having two moms , right ?
we love having you , my sweet .
baby , love .
what &apos;s wrong , honey ?
ana &apos;s here , and i think she &apos;s high or something .
um , so how many of you are there , again ?
uh , well , i have two moms ,
callie , who they just adopted ,
and her little brother jude .
they &apos;ve lived with us for like , a year now .
and then there &apos;s the twins , jesus and mariana .
i think we adopted them when they were like six
and i was seven . but i mean ,
it just feels like they &apos;ve always been around .
never realized how boring my life was until now .
what ? why ?
you know , just , your family .
your story . you .
it &apos;s all so amazing .
well , you are anything but boring .
so , uh , how long till they get back ?
um , i don &apos;t know . couple hours , maybe .
all right , so where should we ...
okay , fyi , we came home to be alone ,
not to ... you know . in case that &apos;s what you were thinking .
wow . so that &apos;s what you think about me ?
that i &apos;m just some kind of slut ?
no ! no , i ...
you wanna go upstairs ?
okay . but you better not take advantage of me .
what &apos;s going on ?
you ruined everything ! you ruined everything !
calm down !
if you didn &apos;t send gabe to prison ,
we would have been a family .
we could have had a chance !
please !
i wouldn &apos;t have lost the twins .
keep it down .
you ! you ruined his life and you ruined mine .
ana , honey , you need to calm down .
don &apos;t you tell me to calm down !
you took my babies .
okay , ana , you &apos;re out of control ,
i have to ask you to leave .
no !
please , just come home with us .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go !
i was going ...
i will go !
i will go !
but i &apos;m not going anywhere with you or you !
okay . okay .
okay .
no , no , no , i will make sure that she gets home safely .
are you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
i &apos;m sure , love , okay ?
i &apos;ll go with you .
okay .
i don &apos;t understand . she was doing so well .
it &apos;s my fault .
i took her to see gabe this afternoon and ...
i left her alone .
he was drinking a beer . i &apos;m such an idiot .
it &apos;s not your fault , mija .
it &apos;s gabe &apos;s fault .
he &apos;s always been trouble .
this is just proof he doesn &apos;t
deserve our support to get off that registry .
i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s go .
what was that ?
is there someone home ?
let me check .
wait , what if someone &apos;s trying to break in ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll protect you .
what the hell !
oh my god , what are you doing ?
i dropped a glass . why aren &apos;t you at the party ?
why aren &apos;t you ?
uh , cort , this is ... this is callie , my sister .
nice to meet you .
yeah .
we were just , uh , hanging out in the garage .
i just , uh ...
that &apos;s okay . um ...
a.j. , this is cort , brandon &apos;s girlfriend .
sorry , i didn &apos;t realize anyone was home .
yeah , no , i mean , me neither .
well , uh , we &apos;re probably just gonna ...
go back out ...
to the ...
so , you wanna go back upstairs ?
nah . i think i &apos;m gonna go home .
you sure ?
are you sure ?
about what ?
about you and brandon ? just now ?
what was that ? why was that so weird , huh ?
why were you two acting like
you just got caught cheating on each other or something like that ?
a.j. , nothing is going on between me and brandon , okay ? nothing .
nothing doesn &apos;t feel like that , callie .
so , that &apos;s her ?
what ?
callie . she &apos;s the girl you loved
and couldn &apos;t be with for some reason .
now i know why .
look , um ...
we really thought that
her adoption was never gonna happen .
and then it did .
and we didn &apos;t want to destroy the family ,
so that was the end of us .
like , truly , forever .
and no one can ever know .
i would never say anything .
and you know , if this is , like ,
too weird for you , i get that .
it &apos;s not ...
at all .
actually , i think it &apos;s super mature .
not the bored with high school parties kind of mature ,
but the real kind .
you do ?
a sacrifice like that ? definitely .
also , it kind of turns out ,
you &apos;re not the only one who lives with their ex .
me and mason are still in our old place with eddie .
we don &apos;t ... we don &apos;t share a bed or anything .
but that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been picking up extra shifts ,
to save up to get a place of my own .
you know , but it &apos;s just ... it costs so much ,
you know , with first and last and security .
but look , i get it if this is too weird for you .
you &apos;re amazing .
how did it go ?
uh , fine . ana &apos;s home .
passed out .
okay . that &apos;s good , i guess .
do you really think gabe got her high ?
i don &apos;t know , sweetheart .
well , since we didn &apos;t get to do the cake ,
why don &apos;t we do it now ?
okay . let &apos;s ...
what was that for ?
your birthday .
i thought you were mad at me ?
i am . a little .
what ?
uh , there &apos;s someone outside .
sorry . i was just leaving these .
yeah . you wanna come in ?
nah , i should go .
happy birthday .
who was that ?
that was my birth father .
how was the party ?
it was okay .
how was homecoming ?
well , we won .
that &apos;s great .
i wish you &apos;d been there .
do you really ?
well , yeah , of course . i mean , i invited you .
because you never come down to san diego .
i have games on the weekends .
you didn &apos;t have to sign up for football and soccer and ...
what ... what are you ... what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s just so hard .
i mean , we barely ever talk .
we text all the time , jude .
texting is not a real conversation .
is this about the picture i sent you ?
no .
i mean , sort of .
i just didn &apos;t know why you sent it .
are you trying to say you wanna have sex ?
no , i ...
i mean , i don &apos;t know .
you know , a lot of the guys on the team ,
they send those pictures to their girlfriends ,
and i thought you might like it .
it &apos;s not i didn &apos;t like it , it &apos;s just ...
i didn &apos;t know what it meant .
you ever think that ...
maybe the only reason why we got together
was because we were the only two gay boys in our grade ?
do you think that ?
we were friends first .
i guess that &apos;s the problem .
you don &apos;t feel like my friend anymore .
okay , well , what do you want to do ?
jude , do you want to break up ?
do you ?
♪ happy birthday to you ! ♪
all right , callie , why don &apos;t you help brandon cut the cake ?
and who wants some presents ? who &apos;s ready for some presents ?
