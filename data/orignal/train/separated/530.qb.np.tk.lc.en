don &apos;t tell me you got another case .
no , no , no , no , no . baby , i &apos;m coming home .
i swear i &apos;m coming home .
good . me , too .
no !
what &apos;s wrong ? !
derek , are you there ?
what &apos;s wrong ? !
wake him up .
he is awake .
what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s dissociating himself from the pain
he knows we &apos;re going to inflict .
outstanding .
hello hello hello !
daddy ! daddy ! daddy &apos;s home !
daddy &apos;s home !
what ?
daddy !
oh , wow , yes !
yes , yes , daddy is home !
daddy is home .
look at you , my beautiful babies .
my beautiful babies !
how are you guys doing today ?
good .
oh , wow , what do you got ?
did you make this all by yourself ?
for me ?
oh , it &apos;s so good .
it &apos;s so good .
you &apos;re late .
daddy &apos;s in trouble .
so you know what ? it &apos;s time for dinner .
gotta go wash &apos; em up . go , go , go , go !
you promised .
baby , it was work .
you promised .
come on , now . work is work .
and work makes all of this work .
yeah , it works because i put in a 10 @-@ hour shift
and made it home to do two sets of homework ,
give two baths , and cook for 4 .
woman , do you know how much i love you ?
how much i appreciate everything that you do ?
how much ?
this much .
baby ...
what is it ?
daddy &apos;s home .
you &apos;re late .
you promised .
you want to make it work , make this work .
it works because i put in a 10 @-@ hour shift ,
made it home to do two sets of homework ,
give two baths , and cook for 7 .
word .
you say you &apos;ll be home for dinner , be home for dinner .
she was waiting on you , derek .
get home for dinner , derek .
keep your word , derek .
where are you ? where are you , derek ?
i &apos;m trying .
i &apos;m trying .
i &apos;m trying .
problem is , you &apos;re goin &apos; in the wrong direction .
can &apos;t avoid me forever .
do i know you ?
come on .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m not going anywhere with you .
we &apos;re not going anywhere bad .
but we are going .
come on .
his heart rate &apos;s back to baseline .
start a fire .
ok .
i get it .
i get it .
you , this . this is all in my head , right ?
so i can survive what they &apos;re doing to me .
who are you ?
you want a hint ?
daddy ?
dad ?
derek
what did you find ?
no sign of him . but they left this
in his car at the parking lot .
could savannah tell us anything ?
she said she thought she heard 3 attackers
and that morgan sounded drugged before they cut off the call .
then it &apos;s a coordinated , planned attack ,
most likely professional .
we did just take down a network of online hitmen ,
but if this is blowback , why morgan ?
we have to assume that we &apos;re all targeted .
i &apos;ve put protective details on each of our families ,
but i want savannah to stay here .
how is she ?
she &apos;s being brave .
you know what the worst part is ?
what ?
i live with a profiler .
so i know things i shouldn &apos;t .
like if they--if they wanted him dead ,
he &apos;d already be dead .
right ?
that &apos;s right .
garcia needs us .
you can stay here .
whatever we find out , we &apos;ll tell you .
i know wherever you are , you can hear me .
this is white phosphorus .
fortunately for you ,
there &apos;s a high ignition point .
so , uh , we have a few minutes .
it &apos;s good to see you , son .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re not happy to see me .
yes . of course i &apos;m happy to see you .
i just can &apos;t pretend that i don &apos;t know what this is .
that i &apos;m just a figment of your imagination ?
yeah .
maybe i &apos;m here
because you &apos;re gonna die
and i &apos;ll make it less scary .
or maybe i &apos;m here to help you hang on .
or maybe i &apos;m a cop and you &apos;re a profiler
and i can help you understand how you got here .
i don &apos;t know how i got here .
i don &apos;t recognize those men .
when you start a case ,
what &apos;s the first thing you look at ?
victimology .
who &apos;s the victim ?
me .
we start there .
but here &apos;s the trick .
you want to make sense of this .
so you gotta start at the beginning .
you gotta go way back .
where do we start ?
november 7 , 1985 .
this is the block derek was taken from .
that blue dot is him .
and then at 9 : 23 , we lose him .
so i checked all the other cell signals in the area .
they &apos;re all legit , aside from one that i was only able to find
thanks to some technology
no one outside this room needs to know about .
what is that ?
an encrypted signal most likely bouncing off a satellite .
i know we &apos;re thinking this would be tied
to our darknet investigation ,
but satellite encryption is much higher in technology
than most online crime .
that &apos;s true , but the hitmen are still our best lead .
we need to exhaust that before we move on to other theories .
jj , you and garcia will take an armed agent to savannah &apos;s house
and get her to pack a bag .
yes , sir . absolutely . but why me ?
because while she gathers her things ,
we &apos;re going to see if they were under surveillance .
whoever &apos;s behind this has been planning this for weeks ,
if not months .
we have no time to catch up . let &apos;s move .
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
penelope , he &apos;s gonna be ok .
he &apos;s gonna be ok , he &apos;s gonna be ok ,
he &apos;s gonna be ok , he &apos;s gonna be ok ...
this isn &apos;t the first time i &apos;ve done this .
but it will be the most that i &apos;ve enjoyed it .
how am i supposed to do this , pop ?
you know how . you do it with witnesses all the time .
what do you call that ?
cognitive interview .
that &apos;s the one .
oh , man .
you know how many knuckleheads i could have put away
if i had your training ?
the question is , can you apply that training to yourself ?
go ahead , derek .
do it .
it was november 7th .
i was in the fifth grade and i started throwing up
in the middle of math class .
mom was at work , so you had to pick me up .
you were mad .
you thought i was faking .
can you blame me ? you faked out of school before .
you take that state capitals test ?
yeah .
how &apos;d you do ?
got &apos; em all , i think .
what &apos;s the capital of nevada ?
carson city .
oh . so close .
it &apos;s las vegas .
nuh @-@ uh .
the judges have spoken .
it is las vegas .
it &apos;s carson city .
you want anything from the store ?
can i have a gatorade ?
one gatorade coming up .
dad , stop !
this is 99 @-@ 60 .
we got a 212 at marquette and racine .
you stay here . keep your head down .
dad !
dad !
i &apos;ll be ok .
i &apos;ll be ok .
dad ! no !
i &apos;ll be ok .
no ...
only you weren &apos;t ok .
nothing was ok after that .
you had to accept something no one should have to accept .
especially at 10 years old .
which is that dads die .
my death ...
whose fault was it ?
the man who pulled the trigger .
yeah , him .
but who else ?
who do you blame ?
you .
i blame you .
if you want to be angry at me , then be angry .
i can take it .
i &apos;m not angry .
i never was .
no ?
i blamed you for making me believe .
believe what ?
&quot; if i were to remain a knight , said arthur ,
i should pray to god to let me encounter
all the evil in the world in my own person ,
so that if i conquer , there will be none left .
and if i were defeated ,
i would be the one to suffer for it . &quot;
it &apos;s getting late . your mama &apos;s gonna kill me .
oh , but it &apos;s just getting good .
you wait till lancelot shows up .
then it really gets good .
you &apos;re kind of like a knight , aren &apos;t you , dad ?
eh , never been on a horse before .
but i have saved a damsel in distress or two .
night .
are you protected by god like they were ?
come on , now . of course i am .
everyone with a badge is .
now go on to sleep .
that &apos;s why i told you to stop the car .
i thought if you helped that lady , you &apos;d be protected .
i would have done it anyway .
that &apos;s why i wasn &apos;t mad at you back then .
that &apos;s also when i had to start figuring things out for myself .
like god .
he doesn &apos;t stop bullets , pop .
and he damn sure doesn &apos;t stop bad men .
i have to do that myself .
fire in the hole !
it &apos;s burning .
pop , it &apos;s burning !
son , listen to me .
the man who &apos;s doing this wants to break you .
you hold out .
he &apos;ll make a mistake .
will you stay with me through this ?
yes .
you promise ?
yes .
his heart rate &apos;s going back down .
that &apos;s impossible .
cut him loose .
why ?
i want him naked .
wait for this .
wait for it .
now .
hey . so i just talked to your neighbors .
they didn &apos;t see anything ,
and i didn &apos;t find anything forensic outside .
so , they weren &apos;t peeping on us through our windows ?
thank god for that , i guess .
that leaves you , penelope .
finishing my diagnostic now .
i think i have something .
do you have a wireless router on your dvr ?
uh , i think so .
ok .
they used it as their back door .
and then the encrypted phone call ,
this is the hacking version of that same thing , and--
oh , man , they were all up your business .
was it the same unsubs ?
my money says yes , but what what &apos;s weird
is they used an intranet .
what is that ?
an intranet is a private closed system .
they use a portal to a public page .
will someone explain why the cia would abduct derek ?
hey , bob , it &apos;s jennifer . i need a big favor .
who are you ?
solomon @-@ comma-
edgar @-@ hector @-@ bravo- kilo @-@ 3 @-@ alpha @-@ delta .
why are you doing this to me ?
solomon @-@ comma @-@ edgar-
hector--
why are you doing this to me ?
you &apos;re a job . an assignment .
they told me to bring you here and hurt you .
i do as i &apos;m told .
where &apos;s your backup ?
no backup . just--aah !
just--just cleanup . just cleanup .
when are they coming ?
12 hours .
isolation was the whole point ,
so no one would ever find you .
look for yourself .
we &apos;re stranded .
good thing you know someone with a ph.d in chemistry .
a couple years back when our troops
encountered white phosphorus in iraq ,
reid took it upon himself to find a cure .
the kid wouldn &apos;t shut up about copper sulfate .
well , maybe you should thank him the next time you see him .
am i ever going to see him again ?
that &apos;s up to you .
just like your boss said ,
you don &apos;t have enough for a profile yet .
why are we back here ?
you &apos;ve been here before ,
when you were 15 years old .
if i visited this place when i was 15 , i would remember that .
because you didn &apos;t visit it ,
you built it .
what was going on at 15 ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about that .
we have to .
the man who did that to you
was a pillar in the community .
i met him before i died .
i was fooled , too .
i was just a kid .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
so i did nothing .
that &apos;s not true .
you survived .
you created this space ,
the space in your head the monster couldn &apos;t get to .
but that place never went away .
it was still here for you when you needed it .
like now .
are you ashamed of me ?
i should have fought more , like ...
you would have .
no .
i &apos;m not ashamed of you .
i &apos;m proud .
proud ?
how can you be proud ?
because you turned your pain into your greatest asset .
and i saw it .
you became the man of the house .
you took care of your sisters and your mother .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re good at what you do .
my contact at the agency told me the guys who took derek
are freelance contractors and not on our side .
so they &apos;re ex @-@ spooks ?
mostly foreign , a few domestic .
these guys have figured out how to piggyback
on existing infrastructure to hide their tracks .
my contact thinks it might be this group .
it &apos;s hard to sync out who might be hitching
a ride on their computer traffic .
fortunately , one of the cia versions of me
is trying to crack their encryption signatures .
what do we know about them so far ?
a 6 @-@ man team . they do dirty work for the highest bidder .
what kind of dirty work ?
from what we can tell , disappearances .
if you need someone politically inconvenient to disappear ,
these guys make that happen .
when you &apos;re in the field , what do you rely on ?
my training .
instinct .
and ?
my team ! the one i really need isn &apos;t here .
hey there .
all you had to do was ask .
hold on . whoops . hi .
let &apos;s go .
he was giving me a name and a serial number .
military training .
yeah , but that combination of letters and numbers isn &apos;t in my database .
my database being your brain .
no rank . there was no rank .
he doesn &apos;t have rank . not anymore . he &apos;s out .
that &apos;s not enough . i need more . give me more .
garcia , can you zoom in on the tattoo on his forearm ?
yeah .
morgan &apos;s in more trouble than we thought .
&quot; who dares wins . &quot;
&quot; who dares wins . &quot;
that &apos;s the motto of the british special air service .
which my system / slash /
your drunken night hanging out with scotland yard
is now filling me in on .
the s.a.s. designed the first survival course ,
which our military used as the basis for sere school .
that in turn evolved into ...
enhanced interrogation techniques .
they &apos;re torturers , pop .
and they &apos;re coming back .
listen ...
i &apos;ll tell you , they &apos;re all dead .
i need an exfil now .
just get me out of here .
no , no , now .
no , you listen .
just get me out of here regardless .
you son of a bitch .
you got a phone ?
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s killing me .
i need that phone .
give me the phone !
no ! no , don &apos;t do that !
no ! no ! don &apos;t do that !
i just told you not to do that !
it won &apos;t work now . the phone is useless .
whatever you swallowed you can throw back up .
why are you doing this to me ? !
why @-@ why are you doing this to me ?
why ? !
not like this !
not--not like this .
not like what ?
you get to decide , do you ?
no .
but i &apos;m not doing this .
i &apos;m not dying in some house in the middle of nowhere .
well , you let me know when you &apos;re done with your temper tantrum .
that &apos;s a dominican , right ?
yeah .
we had a day of the dead thing at work .
i put that in there for you .
i got it .
i &apos;m back , pop .
good . think like a profiler .
your team will find this farmhouse .
that &apos;s inevitable .
but what will they find
when they walk in the door ?
fbi !
morgan ?
spence .
anyone want to say anything ?
i do .
i do .
hotch .
hotch .
you &apos;ve kept this team together , man .
i know that .
i want to thank you .
jj .
jj , you &apos;re one of the best people i know .
no , jj , wait .
rossi . kid .
you &apos;ve inspired me so much .
i never got to tell you that .
baby girl .
please stay with me .
no . no , please .
please , don &apos;t leave me .
stop that right now .
you &apos;re letting your fear take over .
i &apos;m so tired .
you skipped over the most important part .
when your team comes through that door ,
what are they gonna see ?
me , on the floor ...
with a useless phone in my hand .
wait .
if i press redial , one of those guys is gonna answer .
exactly .
you see it now ?
yes , i--i see it .
i--i may have a line on him .
i just got notification from fort eustis .
that encrypted sat phone , it became active again
and we managed to pin down one side to here .
it is a 20 @-@ mile radius in virginia .
the other side was to a contractor
who didn &apos;t even bother not to use his own cell phone .
arrogant . he thinks we can &apos;t find him .
and he would be wrong .
he being john bradley ,
not s.a.s. as we had suspected .
bradley and mr. who dares wins
tried to become s.a.s , but they couldn &apos;t cut it ,
not to mention people who are s.a.s. don &apos;t get tattoos
saying s.a.s. because s.a.s. is covert .
that is the point .
but apparently people who are dishonorably discharged
from the british royal marines do get that tattoo .
your last ping has him in derek &apos;s direction .
he &apos;s probably on his way to him now .
we &apos;ve got helos on the roof
standing by for immediate transport .
any way we can narrow down the search ?
yes . their encryption algorithms are dust .
if and when that sat phone connects , i &apos;ve got him .
hello ?
sir , it just went live .
solomon , is that you , mate ?
ah , it &apos;s agent morgan , isn &apos;t it ?
is this the cleanup crew ?
that &apos;s me .
well , you got a whole hell of a lot of
cleaning up to do when you get here .
that &apos;s funny to you .
yeah , what &apos;s funny is you trying to keep me on the line .
even if your team finds you ,
all they &apos;re gonna find is a corpse ,
because i &apos;m closer .
that &apos;s tough talk .
how are you feeling right now ?
not so good , i bet .
so , yeah , i &apos;ll be seeing you , real soon .
son . son ?
wait .
come on .
what else is there ?
how did you get here , derek ?
they kidnapped me ,
from the grocery store .
i was buying food for dinner .
for who ?
savannah .
do you love her ?
yes , i--i do .
there &apos;s the moment when you realize you love a woman ,
and the moment you realize you &apos;re gonna marry her .
i want to hear about the second one .
it was the end of last year .
i &apos;d gotten in late from a case .
it was a bad one .
she found me downstairs .
she didn &apos;t have to ask .
we just sat there , till the sun came up .
no words .
you were getting food from the store .
does she cook a lot ?
no .
she can &apos;t cook worth a damn .
i know dinner &apos;s ready when the smoke alarm goes off .
she knows it , too .
she hates her cooking almost as much as i hate eating it .
must have been important , then , her wanting you home for a meal .
she said she wanted to tell me something .
something bad ?
no . it ...
she said it was something good .
i just want to tell you i &apos;m happy .
and maybe i &apos;ll show you how happy when i get home .
ok . ok . i like the way that sounds .
i think it was something wonderful , pop .
yeah ?
she &apos;s pregnant .
what are you gonna do , son ?
are you gonna make it home for dinner ?
hello , agent morgan .
you were an expensive job , mate .
after what you did here ,
i &apos;ll finish you for free .
i say , is that all you got ?
dad !
pop !
you said you were gonna stay with me through this !
where are you ? !
right here , son .
wakey , hmm ?
wake up .
come on .
it &apos;s time to die .
not yet .
get medical in here .
dad ...
what is it , morgan ? what is it ?
i &apos;m scared , pop .
i can &apos;t feel anything .
pop , i &apos;m scared .
dying is easy .
you know what &apos;s hard ?
not being there for your son .
i want to .
i do .
i want to be there for my family .
savannah , mom , my sisters .
all of them , pop .
but what if i &apos;m not strong enough ?
that &apos;s why i walked you through those moments ,
so you could see what i &apos;ve seen for 30 years .
you are strong enough .
you &apos;ve always been strong enough .
pop ...
i love you , son .
more than you will ever know .
now go be a dad .
how long ?
3 days .
thank you .
savannah .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
i was late for dinner .
it &apos;s ok .
you made it .
no .
the next time you ask ,
i will not be late for you .
or our son .
how did you know ?
i figured it out .
then i guess i should probably tell you
that i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a boy . it could be a girl .
do you know how much i love you ?
how much i appreciate everything that you do ?
will you marry me ?
yes .
yes .
