What happened?
Nothing.
This is not fight club! This is a school.
Why didn't you ever get pregnant? You always wanted kids.
And I have them.
Could you maybe run lines with me?
Jesus didn't give me his pills. Mariana sold them to me.
Kelsey told Principal Sanchez about everything.
You're suspended.
That doesn't mean you can
run out of the house whenever you please
just to go see your boyfriend.
That's a restraining order, Brandon.
If you go within 100 feet of Callie again,
you'll be arrested.
The Independent Living Program.
Get your own apartment.
I'll take that.
Please leave a message.
Hey, it's me. Again.
I...I...I don't...
Did something happen? Are you all right?
We need to talk or something, OK? Or text.
Just let me know what's going on.
I hope you're OK.
OK, eggs are ready. Who wants eggs?
Jesus, want some eggs?
Whites.
Sure, I'll just unscramble these.
What'd yolks ever do to you?
Ever since Mom decided to rip into my wrestling coach
and get me benched...
Do not blame your mother for doing her job.
Hazing is not OK.
This wasn't really hazing, it was more like bonding.
More like a beating. I'll take them.
You got a black eye, Jesus.
That's not acceptable.
This is what guys do.
Oh, please.
Wait, are these cage-free?
Really?
I just wanna be in top shape.
I don't wanna give Coach any excuses to keep me on the bench.
OK. Let's just not go crazy, all right, Jesus?
With the ADHD stuff and all,
you gotta be careful about changing your diet.
I got it. Thank you.
OK.
I miss school.
You're so weird.
OK, I don't miss school, I miss the play.
And I miss...
The star of the play?
Oh, God. Do you think Chase knows I was suspended?
Do you think Chase cares?
OK. I guess I'll start my homework.
I feel like they should call it something different
when you're under house arrest.
So I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon.
So I can take you to work and you can find a ride home?
Oh, that's right, I completely forgot. Yeah, that's fine.
I'll figure it out.
Is there any chance Mike is gonna fix the car anytime soon?
This one-car thing is becoming exhausting.
But think about all the quality time we're spending together.
Jude, love, you do not have to clean up after everyone.
It's not your job.
I know.
There is something we would like to talk to you about, though.
Yes, we would like to move forward with your adoption.
Callie's too?
We certainly hope so.
It's really up to her now. She has to decide if she...
...if she wants to be part of the family.
Ok.
So, what we need from you is to know
if Callie decides she does not want to be adopted,
do you want to be adopted without her?
Listen, rule number one of Daphne's place:
no more U frickin' A's.
Maybe you girls can come by sometime this weekend
and help Daphne clean up this place. Get you started off right.
Yeah.
Now you ready to keep up your end of this deal, yeah?
OK, we got weekly AA meetings, you gotta go to school,
you gotta get a GPA that is passing,
you gotta get a part-time job,
make sure that you contribute to the cost of living,
and you got counseling, right? Right there.
That's a lot.
It's just one thing at a time, honey.
One thing at a time.
Someone you need to talk to?
No.
Just curious if it works.
Emma!
What's with the plastic undershirt, Foster?
Are you bagging?
I'm trying to drop a class.
Coach doesn't have anyone else on the team at that weight,
he's gonna have to pull me from the bench.
That's takes serious dedication. I've trained you well.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Because of your mom? Nah.
I'm not big on icing people out,
that's why I don't hang out with girls.
Since you're dropping weight, I guess you won't be eating this?
Is that Dijon mustard?
So how're the kids?
Teenagers.
But pretty great, considering.
And we're fostering two more now, we're planning to adopt them.
Hoping to.
Wow, you and Stef are so brave.
Is that code for insane?
Well, yes, but the best kind of insane.
So, cycle regular?
Yes.
And, uh, any pain? Any tenderness in your breasts?
Only when I'm PMS-ing.
OK. Good.
So do you have any questions for me?
Am I too old to get pregnant?
Are you serious?
No... not really.
I mean, that would be insane. The bad kind.
Well, if it's something you want...
I did. Uh...
And then I met Stef, and Stef already had Brandon.
And then... the twins,
and now Jude and Callie.
I guess I just wanna know...
is it even possible?
Alright, I'm on. I get it.
Whoa! Sorry, sorry!
You can't just come in here anytime you want! I need my privacy!
I had to bring my bag up.
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!
We need to establish some ground rules.
Number one: when you see this on the door,
it means... it means I'm taking a little Jesus time.
What's so funny?
I think I know what "Jesus time" Means.
That's not what I mean.
Look, hat on the door, don't come in. Got it?
But that's not fair!
My room, my rules.
Fine.
Hey, babe. Have fun at the gyno?
It's more action than I've gotten from you in a while.
Hey, now!
Who's that?
Dad?
You get a new car, Frank?
Brand-new car.
Toyota Prius V. But it's not mine.
It's yours.
No, it's great, really. It's huge.
It's got these sliding rear seats that recline,
and it's got enormous cargo space.
I think you could probably fit the whole family in here.
Plus, it's a hybrid, right? So that's great.
I mean, because it's, you know, really environmentally,
you know, whatever liberals think it should be.
So, what do you think?
Uh... I think we can't accept it.
Come on, now. Sharon told me that the Volvo broke down.
And I know that Lena's parents helped buy the house,
so I thought I could help you buy a car.
I mean, look at it as a belated wedding present.
You mean the wedding you didn't attend?
No, I mean the wedding I wasn't invited to.
Well, that's a convenient way of looking at it, Dad.
No, I was coming to the wedding, until you told me not to.
I told you not to come unless you could really support our marriage.
I have been nothing but respectful
towards you and Lena and the family.
I've accepted your lifestyle.
My lifestyle?
You know, I'm really trying here, Stef.
I'm trying to make it right by you.
So cut me a little slack, would you?
Please, just take the car back, Dad.
Family Day is tomorrow.
You finally get to see your brother.
Nervous?
No.
Who else is coming?
My, um...
...foster moms?
I don't really know what to call them anymore.
Um, their kids, I guess.
What about Brandon?
Well, I don't know, seeing as somebody took my phone.
I doubt it.
So I had an interesting chat with Dr. Hillcroft today.
Yeah? She doing well?
Yeah. She says hello.
She was asking me...
Come in.
Hey, honey. What's up?
So I heard everyone is going to Family Day?
I'd like to go.
Look, Callie and I never should have kissed.
We just got caught up in the moment, at the wedding.
Brandon, you said you're in love with her.
I don't know, I...
I guess I got all messed up when she ran away.
Yes, you did.
Look, I get it.
But I just really wanna start putting all of this behind us
so we can be a family again.
And we should trust you?
Yes.
OK. We'll sleep on it.
Good night.
You buying it?
I have no idea.
When did our lives become so complicated?
I'm sorry, Dr. Hillcroft was saying something?
Yeah, I...
I don't remember.
Damn, Callie. You roll deep.
I wish someone would bring my boyfriend to Family Day.
Then again, I'm not dating my brother, so...
Foster brother.
Happy Family Day!
Sweetheart!
Hi!
OK!
Missed you. Hi!
Hi!
Hi, beautiful.
I missed you.
You look wonderful.
Well, welcome, gang. Come on in.
That's messed up they brought Brandon.
Yeah, it's like bringin' smack to a Becka party.
You OK?
It's good. Jude's here, so...
He's cute. Reminds me of my little cousin.
He's a dumbass.
You run out on him, he hugs you,
and takes you back like it's no biggie?
Damn, Becka, be nice for once.
Who is the hottie in the sweatshirt?
Jesus.
You've been kissing the wrong brother.
He has a girlfriend.
That has never stopped Gabi.
Brandon's way hotter.
He's got a girlfriend too.
Carmen, Brandon or Jesus?
I'm not interested in boys.
Called it.
I like men.
So, what's it like? Do you have any beefs?
Are you on the bug-juice?
Who's got jigs for you if you have to dance on the blacktop?
Um, I actually have no idea
what any of that means, but, um, things here are OK.
Busy.
Thanks.
So, what do you guys do around here?
Um, well, we get up at 5:45,
and breakfast at 6:30, chores.
We do all the cooking and cleaning and so on.
If we don't do it all right, we get extra.
Thanks.
Then we have school,
and homework, group, more jobs.
Then lights out at 9:15.
Sounds like a system we should try at home.
What do you guys say?
Families?
Would you please join us in the dining room?
The girls have prepared a late lunch.
Jesus?
I'm good. Big breakfast.
This all looks delicious, you guys.
They make us go to cooking classes after school.
So Chinese, Italian, Indian.
Hence the orange chicken and cornbread.
Will you teach me some of this when you come home?
Sure.
How is everything?
How's school?
Fine.
Have you seen Connor lately?
Yeah. At school.
Right.
Jude, I'm sorry.
It's OK if you're angry.
I'm not.
Jude...
It's just...
you always push everybody away.
I just never thought that you'd do it to me.
I wasn't.
No, Jude, I was trying to protect you.
So you could get adopted.
Well, I am.
I am getting adopted.
With or without you.
Stef and Lena already started the paperwork.
That's... that's great.
It's all working out.
So you took out a restraining order against your son.
Want to explain why he's sitting on my couch?
He just wants things to get back to normal, so...
Hm. And you trust him?
We're actually not sure.
We were hoping that today would help to answer that.
Risky strategy.
Brandon's our son.
If we ever wanna be able to bring Callie home,
we're gonna have to deal with it sooner or later, so...
Mm. I think you might need to have a conversation with Callie.
She's applied for our Independent Living Program.
She's trying to get her own apartment.
So, what are you guys gonna do when you get out of here?
I'm getting my daughter back. First thing.
I got a list. I'm gonna be a nurse,
or like a kindergarten teacher.
I'm joining the Army so I can shoot a sweeper.
I may be an actress.
I wanna be, like, a beautician
and an archaeologist and a housewife.
And a mom.
Oh, me too. I'm gonna be a mom.
I hate kids.
You guys done with these?
Yeah.
What happened?
Why are you breaking up with me?
I'm not.
Well...
What's up with the texts?
"I can't do this?" "It's over?"
I didn't write that.
Well, someone did.
I don't even have my phone, somebody took it...
I thought he threw it out... I'm gonna kill him.
I'm so sorry.
No, no, it's OK.
I'm just happy you didn't...
I didn't.
演唱者 Genevieve
We're just talking.
That's OK, talking is allowed.
Uh, Callie, Rita was telling us about Independent Living.
I was going to tell you.
So is that... that's really what you want to do?
Um, I want to thank you for everything that you've done for me.
And for adopting Jude.
I really feel like it's time for me to be on my own.
Brandon, did you know about this?
No.
How is a 16-year-old girl allowed to live on her own?
I don't know.
How is she even allowed to make that choice so soon?
Shouldn't there be some sort of cooling off period
before we let a teenage runaway make a major life decision?
It makes me sad too. She has an entire lifetime to be alone.
Why make things so hard on herself now?
Do you think she's doing this so she can be with Brandon?
I hope not.
I'm busy!
I need my homework.
Come back later!
What's in the bag?
OK, I know you didn't throw my phone away.
And I know you've been texting Brandon.
I was doing you a favor.
I don't need favors.
You can't have a boyfriend while you're in here.
You can't do drugs either.
So that's in your bag, right?
Here's the deal.
You give me the phone back, I won't get Rita.
It's not what you think.
Wait.
Respect the hat!
I need my homework!
Dude, the hat was on the door!
Who are you talking to?
That's not Lexi.
Shut up!
Hi. I'm Emma.
So you're telling me you just locked me out
without my book for over an hour
so you could have "Jesus Time" with another girl?
Wait, what's "Jesus Time?"
You on the computer with Lexi?
Emma, stop it.
I hope you don't think you and I were gonna have "Jesus Time."
No, it's not like that!
Hey! It's my room too!
Well, too bad.
You can't just write rules as you go!
You can't just lock me out!
Jude!
Hey! What's going on here?
He keeps putting his stupid hat on the door
so he can have "Jesus Time."
Is that true?
I'm gonna go. Talk to you later, Jesus.
Jesus, be the big brother, please?
We will be back to discuss this. Jude, we need to talk.
Come on.
You can't throw things at people,
that's not how we solve our problems here.
Jesus kicked me out of my room.
And he shouldn't have done that.
He's gonna hear about it. But that's not an excuse.
I'm sorry.
Never again, bud.
He called it his room. His room.
He threw something at Jesus, like a real little brother!
Yay!
I'm not a drug addict.
OK.
I'm serious. Those weren't "Drug" drugs.
They're hormones.
I can't wait any longer to be put in an LGBT home
or to turn 18 so I can get a doctor to prescribe them.
What about your parents?
They like sign off, or... give consent?
Did you see any parents there for me on Family Day?
That's five in a row. They don't approve.
They think me being a boy is just code for me being a lesbian,
which they're not cool with either.
Told me to act like a girl, or get out.
Lived on my own for ten months.
Did what I had to do to survive, and pay for the hormones.
Got busted. Got sent to juvie. Got sent here.
I've been off them for a few months,
and my body is freaking out, reverting back to...
Look...
I need to use your phone to call my hook-up,
so I can get back on the hormones.
The Brandon thing was just...
me being a jerk.
I'm sorry.
You may have noticed, I've got some anger issues.
Are they safe? The hormones?
Yeah.
They're exactly what I would get
if I was allowed to see a doctor.
Well, just tell me when you
need to use the phone and I'll give it to you.
But no more impersonating me.
Deal.
演唱者 Sea Stars
Oh, hell no!
We just need a few minutes.
How'd you know she was here?
You think you're going to stay in here all alone
with your biggest temptation?
We're gonna hit up the 7-Eleven.
We need some more of those wipey things.
We do?
Fifteen minutes.
They're hardcore.
Yeah. That's their job.
I thought you must be missing this.
Thanks.
So this is, uh, Independent Living?
Pretty sweet deal.
Well,it's not like they just give you an apartment.
I have to do a lot of stuff. Like counseling
and special classes.
But, yeah... No, it's...
Let me give you the tour.
That's the bedroom, bathroom,
kitchen, living room.
It's spacious.
This place is too white, though.
I wanna paint mine.
Nice.
Yeah, I've got, like, a couch,
or a love seat, maybe a coffee table.
And some posters or something.
Really make the place mine.
Yeah.
We could, um, put your keyboard over there.
My keyboard?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll, um,
we'll put a 50-inch LCD right over there.
Killer sound system.
That costs too much.
We need to get a nice kitchen table first.
You want a nice kitchen table over a TV?
Where else are we gonna eat our breakfast?
I do make some serious pancakes.
And I can serenade you, anytime you please.

What happened?
Cole?
Back away, OK? Give everybody some room.
Is he gonna be OK, sir?
We're gonna find out soon.
What happened?
Becka found Cole unconscious in the bathroom.
He OD'd.
There were needles on the floor,
and this next to it. Anyone know anything about that?
Ma'am?
Ok, ladies, listen up.
The doctors are gonna be monitoring Cole
for the next couple of hours.
He took a very large dose of street hormones,
and that caused a seizure.
And when he fell, he hit his head.
He told me they're just like the kind a doctor would give him.
Well, they may be.
But they cause a tremendous amount of side effects,
which is why you have to get them from a doctor.
You're his roommate.
I didn't give him the drugs.
And I'm not a narc.
Yeah, but you're supposed to be accountable for him.
It's different.
I'm sorry, OK?
I'm doing the best I can.
No, you're not.
You never say nothing in group.
When you do, you just say what you think we want to hear.
You always asking us to cover for you.
But we all know, all you care about is getting out of here.
So if you don't want to be here, then go.
If you don't take this seriously,
you're screwing it up for the rest of us, and we need this.
How am I screwing it up? None of you want to be here.
We're just here because the court made us.
Yeah, but we ended up here
because we didn't have nobody to look out for us.
And you've got people.
You've got your brother.
You got a family that wants you.
So, what're you doing here?
Here's a four-door sedan, $5,200.
Air. CD player. Power windows.
Anchor points for a baby seat.
Thank God those days are behind us.
Yeah, but it's 12 years old and no warranty.
If it breaks down,
we're right back in the same exact position we are now.
Minus $5,200.
Here's a minivan.
Uh, 2009, a little above our price range.
Not to mention it violates our sacred oath never to drive a minivan.
Or we could always accept Frank's gift.
No.
I'm not saying we should.
I'm just saying we could...
No.
...revisit?
Lena, it's like he's saying,
"I can't support your marriage because I'm a bad father,
but here's a new car to make up for my ignorance and intolerance."
By taking the car, we're saying it's OK. And it's not OK.
It's not, but intolerance works both ways.
I'm sorry, exactly how am I intolerant?
You're not, to me.
But we're operating under the assumption
that we're right and he's wrong.
He is wrong.
Yes, of course he's wrong.
But in his perspective, he's right and we're wrong.
So maybe he's just trying to meet us halfway
because he loves you and he loves our family
and he wants to keep that relationship with us.
No. My dad sees a problem, he writes a check, boom, problem solved.
Maybe this isn't a payoff. Maybe this is just a nice gesture?
You know what would have been a better gesture?
Coming to the wedding.
In all fairness, you asked
him not to come unless he changed his beliefs.
Yes, his bigoted beliefs!
Stef, it'd be like if he invited us to dinner,
but only if we registered Republican first.
Wow, you must really want this car.
Oh, God! That is not fair. This has nothing to do with the car.
I'm just thinking that this is a real opportunity
for you to talk things out with him.
I've been down this road with him so many times, Lena.
And you know that.
Stef.
Stef.
Dr. Hillcroft, hi.
Hi, Lena?
So I got your test results. Your levels are all good.
So that means I still have time?
Actually, at your age,
levels can drop drastically in a pretty short period.
What does that mean?
Well, if you want to get pregnant, it could be now or never.
So would you like me to start you on pre-natal vitamins?
I can call in a prescription.
Yes.
The girls are right about you, you know. You don't commit.
And we nearly lost Cole.
That's not fair.
Of course it isn't. But that's how it works.
I know exactly what you're doing, Callie.
Another person to tell me who I am.
I've been married a couple of times.
My first husband, sweetest guy, Jeff.
Let me guess, something terrible happened to him
and you've never forgiven yourself.
I cheated on him.
I was so insecure.
I didn't think I was smart enough or funny enough
or thin enough for him to ever really love me.
I never felt safe.
I couldn't ever trust, so I couldn't ever commit,
I was so sure that everything was gonna be taken from me,
that I took it away from myself.
I don't really know why, Callie, but you do the same exact thing.
Always with one foot out the door,
never taking the time to really connect.
I think it's 'cause you're scared.
I'm not scared, I'm sick of it.
I just want to be on my own.
You do?
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Really? Yeah.
Because you think it's safer that way?
Ok, Rita, I get it. You want me to go back to the Fosters.
I'm not you, OK? That's not what I want.
That doesn't mean there's something wrong with me.
Honey, I'm not here to make choices for you.
But you need to realize
if you keep making decisions the way you've been making decisions,
you're gonna ruin every good thing that comes your way.
No matter what it is, no matter how great it is,
you're gonna blow it up because you don't trust it.
Whether that's the ILP, the Fosters,
your time here, everything.
I've gotta go study.
Of course you do.
Now, slowly. Because I got you.
I'm fine.
OK. Callie, a little help with the bed?
Thank you. OK, right here.
Now, gently. Right, there you go. All right.
OK.
How are you feeling?
Like I had a seizure and slammed my head into the sink.
You know what, Cole?
You scared the crap out of me.
I'm sorry.
I'm just glad you're here now.
OK?
You know um... I'm really thirsty. Do you think...?
Yes. I will go get you something. OK. I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Are you OK?
I heard Rita calling my folks at the hospital.
Telling them know where I was, what happened.
I just really thought they would come.
I'm sorry, I'm tired.
I know where I need to be now.
I need to be here.
Hey, Dad?
Don't worry, I'm not here to yell at you.
Dad?
Hey, Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
