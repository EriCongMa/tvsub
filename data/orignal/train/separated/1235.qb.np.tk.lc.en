so you think jason &apos;s gonna meet charles somewhere tonight ?
i put one of caleb &apos;s gps trackers on jason &apos;s car .
so the second he moves , we can follow him to a.
i came alone . just like you asked .
that scholarship i got from the carissimi group ...
their homepage looks like it &apos;s some sort of investment firm .
sara , i was just ...
nicole gordon .
hi .
didn &apos;t we talk about the contest ?
what , what contest ?
the cardillo fellowship .
it &apos;s a cash prize and a summer internship at a magazine .
charlie , don &apos;t .
lorenzo , are you okay ?
my name is alison dilaurentis .
i know who a is .
his name is charles dilaurentis and he &apos;s my brother .
authorities have named charles dilaurentis
as a lead suspect in the kidnapping of five rosewood teens
as well as a sixth victim from courtland .
both state and local police remain tight @-@ lipped ...
hey , did , uh , did ali turn in those home movies to the cops ?
the ones that charles left at her house ?
yeah , i think so . why ?
maybe they could do one of those age @-@ progression sketches .
we could finally put a face to the name .
and maybe someone could put a fist to that face .
well , we are officially out of beans .
what did we miss ?
toby says that the highway patrol
is setting up checkpoints at all the state borders .
did he saying anything else
after he accidentally ate half your stash ?
he &apos;s texting me . that &apos;s a win .
hey , guys , shh .
though police have yet to comment officially .
inside sources speculate that the former radley patient
could be responsible for the unsolved murder
of his mother , jessica dilaurentis .
one of the first responding officers on the scene
suffered minor injuries in pursuit of the suspect ...
did you know about this ?
no .
you should probably ask your dad .
yeah , like he &apos;d give a straight answer .
... felony assault to officer malone ..
okay . well , if it is true , it &apos;s awful .
ali &apos;s mom is practically the only person who visited him ,
who even knew that charles existed .
and he used her to fertilize spencer &apos;s petunias .
my mom grows azaleas .
whatever .
charles is vicious . we know all that .
and now everyone else knows it too .
we had birthday cake .
that day at the arcade when jason and i met him .
charles gave me his frosting .
how does that turn into vicious ?
we &apos;re probably done watching this , right ?
do you remember anything else ?
he cried when it was time to leave .
said it was the best birthday he ever had .
the person they &apos;re describing on the news ...
i mean , i don &apos;t even know who that is .
you played skeeball , once .
i wouldn &apos;t call that family bonding .
hanna .
i think what hanna &apos;s trying to say is that
it &apos;s hard for us to imagine that a is actually your brother .
no , what &apos;s hard to imagine is that you feel
even the slightest bit of pity for charles .
little harsh , hanna--
he &apos;s been out for blood , for all of us !
and he &apos;s come way too close more than once .
we hear you , but it &apos;s unfair to ali right now--
why are you trying to shut me up , spencer ?
i &apos;m just saying what you guys are thinking .
if you guys are too scared to be honest , then fine .
i will do it for you .
i &apos;m sorry , alison .
i know this must really suck for you .
but i &apos;m not gonna sit here
and help you give a the benefit of the doubt .
i hope the police catch him because there &apos;s nothing
they could do to him that &apos;s worse than what he did to us .
第六季第八集
jessica donated her time and money to a lot of causes .
i &apos;m sure her husband will be able to explain .
mom , i keep telling you
mrs. dilaurentis gave money to the carissimi group
to support charles because his dad abandoned him .
and you believe this charles person used that money
to give you a scholarship ?
why ?
a gives so that a can take away .
that &apos;s how he plays the game .
mr. dilaurentis did not return your phone calls .
he &apos;s not at the house , he &apos;s not at the rosewood office .
he doesn &apos;t wanna talk to us , so we should just turn over
the money and let him explain it to the police .
listen , i know you &apos;re feeling unsettled
with charles still at large . i just wish you &apos;d trust
that this is the best way to help .
if you &apos;re still feeling this way after we talk to kenneth
we &apos;ll go straight to lieutenant tanner .
deal ?
come on , his office is just around the corner .
well , at least now we know where he &apos;s hiding .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
wait .
if we go over there , they &apos;re just gonna turn the cameras
on you which is the last thing i want to happen .
we &apos;re gonna need to find another way to reach him .
well , i don &apos;t want this money . it doesn &apos;t feel right .
and i don &apos;t want you to give up the chance at a future
if we can clear this out .
you deserve to be able to go to college
after all that you &apos;ve been through .
come on .
i just can &apos;t imagine facing the person that did that to you .
well , we didn &apos;t actually see him .
things ... got hairy fast .
well , i &apos;m just glad you and your friends are okay .
did you really think you could catch him though ?
on your own ?
to be honest , i don &apos;t really know what we were thinking .
well , how do you know he was gonna be there ?
on the news , they , um
haven &apos;t said if this guy sent a message
or if it was some kind of trap or anything--
can we just move on ?
it was scary . someone got hurt , but i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t--
yeah , um , sure . i &apos;m sorry , i was ..
i was just concerned , that &apos;s all .
uh , they , um , used one of your photos to advertise .
i &apos;m guessing that means they &apos;re into your work .
and i &apos;m guessing that this is as close as i &apos;ll get
to seeing my photos on an actual gallery wall .
well , i figured since you weren &apos;t gonna be there tonight
you would at least want to see this .
well , thanks for bringing me one .
yeah .
oh , and good luck tonight .
oh , thank you .
yeah . have fun .
alright . i will .
bye .
bye .
is that clark ?
i was hoping i &apos;d get a chance to meet him .
is that why you were eavesdropping ?
you just met the guy .
he sure was asking a lot of questions .
oh , he &apos;s just worried about me .
no need to be suspicious .
honestly , i &apos;m suspicious of everyone these days .
well , clark is not some blue @-@ eyed blond dilaurentis boy .
relax .
you all could have gotten hurt .
rushing in to confront charles like that .
i &apos;ll relax when he &apos;s in custody .
i know . we screwed up .
maybe if i had called the cops earlier .
look ..
... you had a chance to corner charles , and you took it .
i mean , i don &apos;t like it , but ..
... i get it .
i wish my mom would get it .
she still doesn &apos;t want you to go to the gallery opening tonight ?
we &apos;re going to mike &apos;s sports banquet .
she convinced my dad that it &apos;s better we stay close to home .
uh , you &apos;ve worked so hard to get to this place .
there @-@ there &apos;s gotta be something that we can say or do .
i @-@ i could offer to be your , um personal bodyguard .
that would help .
maybe you should talk to tanner ?
uh , there &apos;s been cops posted outside the house for weeks .
maybe if a car followed us down there .
that is an excellent idea you just gave me .
who ? me ?
no , i just sell books and coffee .
you can fix it with your friends , ali .
they just need help understanding .
they don &apos;t get it . and my dad .
i thought i was doing the right thing calling the police .
charles threatened him .
and now he &apos;s treating me like i &apos;m the threat .
i &apos;ve seen him when he &apos;s upset .
i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
no .
he &apos;s just shutting me out .
ever since that night at the arcade
the only person he &apos;s opening up to about charles is tanner .
she needs to know who she &apos;s dealing with .
don &apos;t i deserve to know that too ?
it must be hard ..
... knowing the person responsible for all of this
is your brother .
i just hate that you got hurt .
hey , your friends could have gotten hurt too .
i just wish i could have stopped him .
made him answer for what he &apos;s done .
you tried .
you were doing your job .
well , now that everything &apos;s out in the open
i have a more personal stake in the outcome .
i got a buddy on tanner &apos;s team . i &apos;ll make a call .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i &apos;ve got one good arm . i &apos;ll use it to dial .
after you eat your soup .
all the healing power goes away
when you re @-@ heat homemade soup in the microwave , so ..
you made me soup ?
i made you soup .
i couldn &apos;t think of a better way to say thank you .
i can .
you &apos;re welcome .
she won &apos;t even go to the police until she talks to mr. d.
isn &apos;t that like withholding evidence
or obstruction of justice or something ?
i know your mom &apos;s hardly violating the omnibus clause .
the what clause ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t even care .
the point is , i object .
the cops could have used that check
to trace that scholarship right into a &apos;s wallet .
look , we don &apos;t need forensic accounting , hanna ,
but we need to figure out if the person signing those checks
is actually charles dilaurentis .
so you were gonna intern at the carissimi group ?
it &apos;s an idea . the application deadline is ..
... two weeks ago .
yeah , and they only give internships for college credit .
we haven &apos;t even graduated high school yet .
you know , i &apos;ve always wondered about college credit .
is that , like , when you show up for class
and they give you some money back ?
because i could really be into that .
no , hanna , college credit is ..
what if we give the money back ?
we close your college account .
we bring the scholarship back ourselves .
if we wanna get inside the carissimi group
that money lets us right in the front door .
i had a hard time choosing but ..
... these are the ones that i picked for the gallery tonight .
you have an eye for detail , aria .
every one of these pictures are so ..
... declarative , succinct .
aria tells me you have concerns about her attendance tonight .
that she &apos;s up for an award .
uh , yeah .
well , with everything going on lately , i just thought--
i would be more than happy to have officers stationed on @-@ site .
we can even put them in unmarked cars
if you don &apos;t want undue attention .
thank you , but , aria , you know
we &apos;ve already committed to mike &apos;s--
i already talked to mike and dad .
they &apos;re okay with it if you are .
can you be okay with it ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry that i sprung all this on you
but this isn &apos;t a display case at my school .
this is my work in a real art gallery .
mom , you worked at a gallery . you know how important this is .
i know , honey .
are you sure ?
i wouldn &apos;t agree to it if i felt there was risk involved .
we &apos;re moving toward a resolution , mrs. montgomery .
things won &apos;t always be like this .
i &apos;m just trying to look out for you .
i know .
take some time to think about it .
if you decide to go , i will make sure
that we have enough manpower there to keep you all safe .
i like the one on the left .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t scream downtown art scene .
hey , there &apos;s a jacket in the closet to the right in the back .
the one with the skulls ?
am i that predictable ? did you text spencer and hanna ?
yeah , they said they &apos;ll meet us at the gallery .
what about ali ?
i haven &apos;t heard back .
well , i don &apos;t blame her .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , that ..
... is not for tonight .
that &apos;s for prom .
i found it in a vintage store a couple of months ago .
you know that feeling when the perfect dress
just speaks to you ?
yeah , i think your wardrobe speaks a lot louder than mine .
can i take a peek ?
no .
no looky @-@ loos .
i added my own spin to match the fairy tale theme .
just want it to be a surprise .
i get it .
it took two fittings to get my dress right .
just hope we all get to wear them .
my mom says that hackett &apos;s just appeasing
a vocal minority , but ..
your mom got the e @-@ mail , right ?
the memo about side boob and backless gowns ?
they send that out every year .
no .
this was just sent to our parents .
i guess the school board is debating
whether it &apos;s safe for us to go to prom .
how can they tell us we can &apos;t go to our own prom ?
people have expressed safety concerns , according to hackett .
because of what happened at the arcade ?
because of charles ?
we &apos;ll fight it .
i mean , after everything we &apos;ve been through
we deserve to go .
we can all kick in for a limo .
we &apos;ll have dinner at carlo &apos;s .
they &apos;ve that really cute patio with all the twinkle lights .
my dress kinda was made for twinkle lights .
okay , so if we do this
will you be my prom buddy ?
two single ladies , we can buy each other those giant corsages
and just go out and have stupid fun .
oh , and i &apos;ll even throw in a couple of slow dances .
you can lead .
i think i might want to slow dance with somebody else .
who ?
sara ?
mr. matthews is on a call . it could be a while .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to take your number--
we &apos;ll wait . thanks .
uh , can i get bubbly water , please ?
she &apos;s fine . don &apos;t .. don &apos;t even worry about that .
hey , that was really rude .
i wanna find something that links this place to charles .
i don &apos;t want her bursting back in here with bubbles .
i wasn &apos;t actually thirsty , spencer .
i was just tryin &apos; to make us look normal .
would you stop touching things ?
what ?
hanna , that &apos;s not a ..
okay , i think you &apos;re being a little bit paranoid .
hanna , what are you doing ?
what are you ..
shh !
stop , nobody is listening to us , okay ?
they can &apos;t hear us . even if they could ..
would you stop it ? you &apos;re ridiculous .
and you have terrible aim .
there &apos;s a recycling bin next to the credenza .
hi , you must be rhys matthews ?
you wouldn &apos;t mind lettin &apos; me borrow that , would you ?
i might wanna take some notes .
yeah .
thanks .
now how can i help you ?
tanner &apos;s been recording her meetings with your father .
like an interrogation ?
no , looks like he &apos;s cooperating .
he hasn &apos;t even involved his attorney .
what was she asking him ?
the tapes and transcripts are off @-@ limits ... to me at least .
i can &apos;t ask my guy to stick his neck out .
sure . i get it .
there is more .
tanner &apos;s called in a profiler .
so my father is definitely talking to her about charles .
what else can he tell her ?
charles was a kid . he needed help .
the profiler fills in the blanks .
they wanna figure out who he &apos;s become .
first they have to know how and why .
would you grab me some water , please ?
sure .
you should probably get outta here for a little bit .
these things are gonna have me knocked out for a while .
no sense in you hanging around watch me drool in my sleep .
clear your head . there &apos;s a spare key .
i &apos;ll do some dishes first .
maybe put in a load of laundry .
really , i don &apos;t mind staying .
was this the first time you two kissed ?
yes .
wait .
sara doesn &apos;t know about the tracking chips , does she ?
i didn &apos;t feel one on her neck
so i figured i shouldn &apos;t tell her .
have you asked her yet to prom ?
i &apos;m not really sure how to .
i mean , i know she wants more , but ...
we haven &apos;t really hung out like that .
and prom is kind of loaded for a first date .
we make it a group thing , like you said .
but sara was down there for so long .
has she been to a high school dance ?
has she even had a first date yet ?
probably not .
um , don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll take it slow .
good .
and we &apos;ll all make sure she has an amazing time .
i promise .
and you &apos;re okay with goin &apos; solo ?
i mean , it &apos;s not 1912 .
you can ask the guy .
i &apos;m sure that caleb and toby will throw me a bone
and give me one dance .
besides , i can &apos;t think of one guy in the right mind
who would say yes if i asked .
not that i want the extra baggage .
you &apos;re right . prom is kind of loaded .
okay , so ..
staying in the friend zone ...
what about clark ?
he asked a million questions about a.
uh , it &apos;s nice that he &apos;s concerned .
i just , i &apos;d rather go with someone
who didn &apos;t wanna interview me .
i &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;ll go unescorted .
not 1912 .
so you received a $ 30,000 scholarship check
deposited it into your college fund
and then changed your mind ?
hanna just feels like--
hanna ?
why aren &apos;t you telling me how you feel ?
my mom applied for these scholarships .
she didn &apos;t know that i had a few other options .
multiple scholarship offers ? that certainly is impressive .
and you &apos;re confident these other options
will fully fund your college tuition ?
totally .
um , are you able to give it to someone else ?
we aren &apos;t in the business of taking back gifts .
it kinda undermines the concept of charity , don &apos;t you think ?
we could help you find another candidate .
i &apos;m sure we know someone . what is the criteria again ?
we &apos;ll most likely return the amount to our scholarship fund
until the next round of applications come in .
so you give away multiple scholarships ?
how many would you say ? per year ?
are you in need ?
no .
i &apos;m not . i just , uh ..
i have a friend who might wanna apply .
and @-@ and you don &apos;t have much information on your website .
it &apos;s difficult to find your organization
on those scholarship websites .
we prefer to offer scholarships selectively .
most of our candidates are recommended
through personal connections .
so who makes the final decision ?
our recipients are ultimately chosen by my employer .
would that be mr. carissimi ?
maybe we could speak with him ?
that &apos;s unlikely .
this private trust exists to provide him with discretion .
well , i would just like to thank him .
maybe i could send him an e @-@ mail or something .
um , hanna ?
oh , uh , i &apos;m just putting his e @-@ mail on my phone .
i don &apos;t wanna forget it .
oh , yeah . good idea .
your boss does have an e @-@ mail address , right ?
i &apos;ll tell you what .
my employer and i have a weekly conference call .
i will alert him to your change of heart
the next time we speak .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s the best i can do .
daphne , i &apos;ll need to see the current holdings report .
it was a pleasure meeting you both .
that guy was definitely hiding something .
yeah , you think ?
you couldn &apos;t pick that even if you tried .
besides , what he &apos;s hiding isn &apos;t in there .
it &apos;s in his freaking dna .
you were thinking it the whole time . same as i was .
that guy looks exactly like--
exactly like a dilaurentis .
did you just see that ?
the guy whispering to his cuff links ?
god , this place is crawling with the police .
you know , aria wasn &apos;t kidding when she said tanner promised
to have this place secured .
where is aria ? i wanna show her that picture of rhys .
charles .
okay .
look , resemblance isn &apos;t fact , hanna .
we still don &apos;t know for sure .
how else did he have ali &apos;s perfect chin
and jason &apos;s perfect hair ?
what if this whole carissimi group setup
is just one big elaborate black hoodie ?
can we just keep this to ourselves for now ?
tonight means a lot to aria .
spencer , this is a big deal .
how am i supposed to keep my mouth shut ?
talk about the art . eat hors d &apos;oeuvres .
what took you guys so long to get here ?
uh , there was just a really long line in the valet and ..
we were following a hunch about charles .
and did you find anything ?
don &apos;t tell aria .
why would aria care if you had a photo of jason on your phone ?
wait , why do you have a photo of jason on your phone ?
that &apos;s not jason .
he says his name is rhys .
wow , you must be excited . this is quite some turnout .
i didn &apos;t expect you to--
aria , why would i miss this ?
i gave you the camera . remember ?
yes . i do . thanks .
so can i ask you something ?
this might be a weird question . it &apos;s so not a big deal .
i @-@ i have no idea why i &apos;m making this such a big deal , but ..
would you , as a friend ..
will you go to prom with me ?
no , no . i know that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s the dumbest idea . you used to teach there .
why would you wanna go macarena with former students ?
i just wanted to be with friends
and wanted to go with a friend .
aria , i--
ezra .
ay , nicole .
hi .
i &apos;m happy you could make it .
yeah .
um , aria , this is nicole .
this is , uh , emily &apos;s friend from habitat for humanity .
right .
the photographer herself !
i &apos;m really looking forward to seeing your work .
thanks for coming .
clark .
i should go say hey .
hey , i thought you weren &apos;t comin &apos; .
yeah , my parents had a change of heart .
well , i &apos;m glad you made it . you feeling good ?
nervous actually .
these photos have been so personal .
i didn &apos;t think what it would feel like to show them
to a room full of strangers .
i mean , you &apos;ve done this before .
does it ever start to feel normal ?
this is a first for me .
i just thought in the program , in your bio
it says that you won some kind of governor &apos;s award .
oh , yeah , sure .
no , i @-@ i just meant that this is the first at an event this big .
looks like you have a pretty nice turnout .
yeah . what about you ?
did your parents come up from baltimore ?
uh , no , no . they , uh , they couldn &apos;t make it .
but they , they know how big of a deal this is , right ?
and it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not that far of a drive ?
no , well , it &apos;s not . i just ..
i didn &apos;t wanna make them feel obligated to come .
in case i don &apos;t win .
oh ! so there &apos;s no one here for you ?
well , i am . so ..
and ... thank you .
i mean , seriously , i @-@ i never would have done this
if it weren &apos;t for you .
you did the work .
you used your camera to tell the truth
and i respect the hell out of that , no matter what happens .
on behalf of the cardillo arts fellowship .
catch up
with you later ?
okay .
&apos; ... welcome you all to our gallery night.&apos;
we are here to celebrate a fresh crop
of promising new photographers
one of whom will leave here tonight
with a $ 5000 cash prize and a summer internship
to a premier travel and leisure magazine
based in los angeles .
i would like to thank all of the young artists
who applied this year .
you gave the judges a real challenge .
and thank you to the rowitz fine arts gallery
for so generously hosting this event .
now , i &apos;d like to invite you all in to meet our finalists .
oh , my god .
he called the pictures stolen dolls ?
where is this going to end ?
he &apos;s talking about when he kidnapped us , right ?
not exactly .
are we supposed to solve his riddles now ?
what does the rest of it mean ?
no ... son ... lindas .
the spanish translates to &quot; they aren &apos;t pretty . &quot;
but it &apos;s a play on words . it can also mean
they aren &apos;t linda &apos;s .
as in linda tanner ?
so charles thinks when you rescued the girls
that you took something from him ?
as much as he wanted to ruin aria &apos;s evening
and exploit the girls , he also wanted to send me a message .
that he thinks we belong to him ?
we already knew that . we lived that .
i grew up in a bilingual household .
i think charles wants me to know
that as much as i uncover about his identity ,
he can uncover details about mine .
why did this happen ? how ?
you told us not to worry . you told us there was no threat .
i still stand by that .
he did this to these girls .
and then he put it up on a wall for everyone to see .
he was in this building !
we are dusting for fingerprints .
we have hours of security camera footage to review .
we will comb through everything
until we find another piece of the puzzle .
when are you gonna find him ?
i have to get back to the precinct .
i ask that each of you give your statement to my detectives
before you leave .
how can she keep looking at them ?
i mean , just thinking about them makes me wanna hurl .
charles took pictures of us while we were unconscious .
it &apos;s just like a car wreck . okay ?
some people look away , and other people stop and stare .
thank god . hanna . hey , come away .
thank you .
that &apos;s him . across the street .
why is he here ?
he &apos;s probably calling his secret boss to report
that he screwed aria out of her internship .
we should follow him .
yeah .
i already told my mom that we &apos;re on our way home .
tell her we stopped at my place and decided to watch a movie .
buy us some time .
杰西卡 · 迪劳伦提斯
you &apos;ve crossed a line , young lady .
what is this place ?
another real estate investment for the carissimi group ?
or another dollhouse for charles .
bet there &apos;s plenty of room inside to lock us up .
what do we do ? do we follow him ?
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going in there .
no , let &apos;s just hang tight .
let &apos;s see what he does .
i find you very intriguing , alison .
this is the last place i &apos;d think to find you
and yet , here you are .
exactly where you &apos;re not supposed to be .
i have questions .
the information in this room is sensitive
and you &apos;ve jeopardized that .
i didn &apos;t touch anything .
i need you to put that down .
&quot; superficial charm ? &quot;
after everything i &apos;ve heard on the news
it almost sounds like a compliment .
is all this what the profiler thinks about my brother ?
your brother .
and you can recognize his baby rattle ?
it &apos;s actually mine .
there was a whole christening set from my godparents .
pieces were lost .
i still have the hairbrush .
we found it along with a few other
personal effects in the bunker .
why do you think that is ?
he took it .
kept it .
maybe he feels bad about trying to hurt me when i was a baby .
he has other things
like the home movies my father gave you .
maybe part of him wants to stay connected to the family .
that &apos;s a possibility . there &apos;s another .
i don &apos;t think it will please your sense of curiosity
about charles , your brother .
in my experience ,
murderers can be as sentimental as mothers .
personal items can help focus them on their victims
or commemorate what they &apos;ve done .
this is harmless .
a baby rattle that you shook in your little , pink fist ?
to your brother , that is a piece of you .
as intimate as hair , teeth , skin .
what will happen ..
... when you find him ?
we &apos;ll bring him to justice .
with lethal force if need be .
you may not want this for your brother
but it &apos;s necessary for the predator
who put six girls through absolute hell .
i &apos;ll take officer calderon &apos;s access card .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll find it useful anymore .
hey , your mother &apos;s finishing up her statement inside .
i can take you both home if you like .
she seems nice .
nicole .
i hope tonight didn &apos;t get in the way--
no , nicole &apos;s a photographer as well
and she saw your postcard at the brew .
i saw that she was interested
so i suggested that we meet here .
it &apos;s not a date .
not anymore .
not at all . i asked her to meet me here
because i @-@ i had a few more questions ..
... about habitat for humanity .
that &apos;s new . why a @-@ are you--
i &apos;m considering it ,
but we don &apos;t have to talk about it now .
sorry , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to grill you .
i &apos;m just ..
it &apos;s okay .
i was just trying not to focus on tonight .
what happened .
yeah , i mean ..
are you okay ?
aria , what happened here was ... desperation .
he &apos;s obviously so close to being caught .
somebody who does this , uh ..
... they seem to have nothing to lose .
charles has us to lose .
he wants us back .
we were drugged when charles took our clothes
and posed us ... in those pictures .
the drugs were wearing off , and i @-@ i was ..
... just starting to come out of it , and ..
i thought i would open my eyes and ..
... be back in iceland .
back before any of this happened .
we &apos;d bundle up .
the whole family , we &apos;d @-@ we &apos;d sit on the balcony and ..
... look for the northern lights in the sky .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d ever been as happy to be cold as i was then .
freezing cold .
waiting for something magical to happen .
and then i knew it .
i felt it on my bare skin .
that cold metal table .
and i opened my eyes ..
... and these horrible things just kept happening .
i &apos;m still cold .
i &apos;m freezing cold all the time .
it &apos;s quiet here . too quiet .
why do you think he picked this place ?
someone &apos;s coming .
what &apos;s clark doin &apos; here ? he was at the gallery tonight .
did he follow us ?
i don &apos;t know .
the last time i saw him , he was talking to aria .
and now he &apos;s going inside ... to talk to a.
we have to get out of here .
i &apos;m texting aria .
she &apos;s still with the police .
good .
maybe this time , they won &apos;t let charles
and his henchman get away .
did you get what you were looking for ?
i needed something to make sense of all this .
i don &apos;t think the disciplinary committee &apos;s gonna see it that way .
tanner ?
i have to report on monday .
lorenzo , i--
don &apos;t . you made me soup .
you folded my laundry .
you waited till i fell asleep .
i know how this looks .
then please don &apos;t try and make it seem like something else .
you asked me to call in a favor for you ?
was it just to throw me off balance ?
no .
how the hell am i supposed to believe you ?
i &apos;m working really hard to understand why you did this .
they &apos;re gonna shoot him ..
... on sight .
&quot; lethal force , &quot; tanner said .
they &apos;re gonna kill my brother
and i don &apos;t really even know him .
i &apos;m one of them , ali .
can &apos;t really see things turning out much better .
i just wish you would have asked .
you would have said no .
and i would have done the same thing anyway .
i put some water on . will you have tea ?
yes , please .
i have chamomile , mint .
unless you want caffeine .
i have darjeeling .
ella ?
are you here about the e @-@ mail from the school board ?
i don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna tell them .
although i don &apos;t think aria &apos;s mind is even there .
especially after tonight .
at the gallery ?
the police are not doing enough .
we need to do something .
but what can we do ?
we have to protect our girls .
ella , what happened ?
can you tell me ?
hey . i got your text .
why didn &apos;t you just ring the doorbell ?
we thought that your dad might be home .
he &apos;s upstairs .
guys , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , i barely know the guy .
what guy ?
fine . i &apos;ll tell her .
your friend clark , we &apos;re not so sure he &apos;s a friend .
what makes you say that ?
we saw him at the abandoned doll factory tonight .
he was meeting some guy named rhys matthews .
are you sure that it was clark ?
none of us saw him leave the gallery
and then he just shows up at this place .
well , did you ask him ?
no .
it didn &apos;t feel safe to stick around and ask questions .
this guy rhys matthews ,
he works for the carissimi group
and we think that he might be working for charles .
and when you see rhys .. aria , i &apos;m telling you .
there &apos;s a chance he actually is charles .
