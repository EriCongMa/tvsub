For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
You said you don't kill to survive.
Animal blood keeps me alive
But not as strong as Damon.
Hello, brother.
Damon.
Stefan finally fessed up.
Stay away from me.
That necklace contains an herb called vervain.
It protects you from being compelled.
I will keep your secret, but...
I can't be with you, Stefan.
What is that?
A very important crystal.
Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
Technically gram says I'm a witch.
There was a time when this town was
Very much aware of vampires
Five bodies all drained off blood.
They've come back.
You just don't wanna die, do you?
She's transitioning.
Into what?
A vampire.
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She'll be fine.
No
We'll all be fine.
Vicky
I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody,
Elena. I promise you.
All right, later, man.
See you, bro.
Hi, Ty
Vicky?
Everyone is looking for you.
I know.
What's wrong, Vick?
I'm so cold.
You are on drugs. Everyone thinks you are off on a bender.
I wish
What happened in the woods? Vicki?
Those kids that were killed.
What did you see?
I'm so scared.
Come here.
It's ok. I will take you home.
I can't control it.
Control what?
I am so...hungry, Ty.
And it won't go away
What did you on?
What drugs did you take?
I want you. I'm so hungrey, Ty.
OK, look, I'll get you something to eat.
Just sit back. Let's just get you home.
Vicky, what is wrong with you? Vick!
Let go of me.
What's going on here, Stefan?
What's wrong with her?
You don't talk.
Screw you, dude.
Dude, really? Dude...
Damon, don't.
Oh, come on. No one is gonna miss this idiot.
Don't you hurt him.
Forget what you saw here tonight.
None of us were here.
Sorry.
Oh, no, it's cool. I'm done
You are up early. Where are you going?
Police station. They are organizing
A search party for Vicky, so...
Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
You are kidding me, right?
You shouldn't skip school.
If they find her, we will know.
That's what cellphones are for.
Your lips keep moving. I don't know why.
Yeah?
Matty?
Vicky, where are you? Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you.
No, Matty. I just need some time
To figure things out.
Just know that I'm OK. Please don't worry about me.
I don't understand why I'm still cooped up here
Why can I just go home?
Because you are changing, Vicky.
And it is not something you want to do alone.
There is nothing about
that Logan guy I killed in here.
Not a word.
Someone has covered it up.
What is that?
It's a very special, very old compass.
What was Logan fell doing with it.
Aren't you curious?
Well, If you are so worried that somebody is onto you
Why don't you just leave town, Damon?
we should all be worried.
Hey, I'm hungrey.
Do you have anything to eat?
Here.
What is it?
It's what you are craving.
Don't lie to the girl.
So not what you are craving,
But it will do in a pinch. Right, Stef
What is it?
Yeah, What is it?
It's skunk, saint bernard, banbi?
Go on, give it a try.
She is new. She needs people blood.
She can't sustain on that stuff.
Yeah, why can't I have people blood?
Yeah.
Because it's wrong
To pray on innocent people, Vicky.
You don't have to kill to feed.
Just find someone really tasty,
And then erase their memory afterwards.
So easy.
No, no, no.
There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, Ok?
It takes years to learn that.
You could easily kill somebody,
And then you have to carry that with you
For the rest of your life.
Which, if I haven't made clear, is eternity.
Don't listen to him
He walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line
I say, snatch, eat, erase
Hey, look at me. We choose our own path
our values and our actions. They define where we are.
OK, count deepak
I am out of here.
Can I have some more?
Is Stephen here?
Yep.
Where is he?
And good morning to you, liittle miss, I'm on a mission.
How can you be so arrogant and glib
After everything you've done?
And how can you be so brave and stupid
To call a vampire arrogant and gilb?
If you wanna me be dead and I'll be dead.
Yes, you were.
And I'm not.
Yet.
Where is Stephen?
He's upstairs.
Singing "The rain in Spain," knock yourself out.
Stephen?
Stephen?
Yes.
Where is Vicki?
She's upstairs.
What happens now?
Because my brother is out there searching for her
With the rest the town.
And I'll tell him.
I'm working with her.
But, it's gonna take time
She's very volatile and impusive personality
She is a drug user.
I mean all that's gonna play a part in how she reponds to this.
So she is a vampire with issues?
What am I supposed to do?
Because I'm lying to everyone I care about.
What's gonna happen to her?
I'll keep her here with me
Until I know that she is safe.
How long is that?
We can talk about it that later.
Hey, Vicki
How are you?
How am I? You're kidding, right?
Was our family burned in witch trials?
No. The girls that were persecuted in Salem
Entirely innocent.
You have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch.
How did we end up in Mystic Falls?
Our family fled Salem in 1692,
And relocated here.
Our ancesters lived in secrecy for over a hundred years.
It's important that we still do.
Grams. Everybody knows you're a witch.
They also know it's absurd, can't be true.
I'm just a cooky lady that teaches occult at the university.
No one really believes.
They just poke fun. And let'em.
Just don't let them know the truth.
Where's our witchcraft?
You've been talking history for two days.
And I wanna go to the fun part.
It's not meant to be fun.
It's real, and it's serious.
And you must understand before you practice.
Aren't you late for school?
You never should have trusted that Logan
Weasel with that watch.
How many are we dealing with?
Well, that coroner thinks one.
Something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern
Are we in danger?
I mean if it found the watch and knows we know
And could it come after us?
And should I even be saying "it"
Or he, or she
If they have any historical knowledge of the town
And they'll know where the watch come from.
So yes, we can very much be in danger.
So what do we do?
Just keep quiet, we can't have the entire town aware of this,
We need to find him before he finds us.
I heard they were putting together a search party for Vicki.
She just called, she's OK.
Oh, good. It's great.
I figured you must've been going out of your mind.
A little bit, yeah.
I was just gonna offer
Is there anything I can do?
I appreciate it.
I have got your costume. It's all here.
Seriously?
Come on
Can someone please be excited about the Halloween
I just wanna have fun, you know.
Just some silly, fluffy, Damon-free fun.
Isn't this the one you got from Damon?
Yep. Wear or toss it. I don't care
I just want it gone.
Have you seen Elena?
Do you know what she is wearing?
I was with grams all weekend. I haven't talked to her.
Maybe, she's with Stephen.
Riding to his castle on his white horse
Don't be bitter. It provokes wrinkles.
Coffee is our friend.
It's the caffeine. It circulates through our veins
And warms our bodies.
So we are not so cold to the touch.
What if I wanna drink human blood?
You gotta have to learn to live with that urge.
And fight it one a daily basis, one day a time.
Oh, God. Don't start with the whole little twelve steps thing.
School Counselor has been down that road And it doesn't work for me.
It can work. It's your choice, Viki.
So you've never tasted human blood.
Not in a long time.
How long?
Years and years.
I'm not proud of my brother's behaviour
Oh, does this sketchy feeling ever go away
It's like I have a massive hangover
This daylight thing is a bitch
I need more blood.
Where's your bathroom? I have to pee.
Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
I'm going to, Un-- I'm gonna get her some more.
Right.
I will be quick.
My body is feeling really funky
It's a good funk, but it's wierd
Who are you calling?
Jeremy
Viki, you can't see Jeremy any more
Oh, come on. Don't you start.
I'm gonna see whoever I want to see
Eventhough you could hurt him?
I would never hurt Jeremy
I know you think that
But I can't take that risk
You gonna have to let Jeremy go now
Oh really
And how long have you been preparing
A "you're not good enough" speech?
I'm presuming it predates the whole vampire thing.
All I'm saying is
Jeremy is not geting involved in any of this.
I mean it, Viki.
Or what?
Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch
You had my brother whipped for 15 years.
15 years, and then you dumpted him.
When I look at you
That is all I see
Just so you know.
And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy
Because I have some fun new toys to play with,
And I won't think twice of ripping your little head off.
You got it
She threatened me
She's on edge
Imagining every sense in your body
Operating at super speed
I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin,
And then when you throw on her other issues
How long before it settles? Hours, days, weeks?
There's no rule book.
Well how long before you learn to control her
A while
But I didn't have anybody helping me.
I have to do it on my own.
The thing is
It's hard to resist certain people,
Espercially when you are new.
It's difficult to separate your feelings.
Love, lost, anger, desire--
It can all blur into one urge,
Hunger
What does that mean?
It means that Jeremy can't see her. Not now
She might not be able to resist him,
And she could hurt him.
Or worse
I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
I need to get going
Elena
Please Stephan. This is only so much I can take.
What are you doing
Just contemplating the next hundred of years
Why did you do it
I was...
Bored
You did this to me out of boredom
It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
Now I'm bored
And all I can think about is blood.
I just want some blood.
I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
That'll ease up.
You've just been cooped up all day.
Let's go
Where?
Your life was pathetic.
Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
What are you doing
She's been cooped up in your room all day.
She is not Anne Frank.
No no no no. Hey hey
Now is not the time for this.
If you are gonna teach her, teach her.
Show her what it's all about.
She could hurt someone
I'm not taking her to Disneyland.
We're going in the front yard.
Come on
Bad idea, Damon
She is a vimpire, Stephan.
She should know the perks.
Like what?
Like...
Whoa. How did you do that?
Come on, Viki
Live a little. No pun intended
Uh, my bad.
Matt?
Vicki?
That's you?
Get in here.
In a minute.
Please come inside, I've been worried.
God, you're ok.
Where were you, Vick.
It's no big deal.
Dropped it, already.
Three people were murdered in the woods.
The cops were looking for you, they wanna qustion you.
They know where I live.
Everyone was worry about you.
I'm back now, just let it go.
Are you kidding?
I'd freaking search purty looking out for you
When you were off on your crazy drug trip.
And you want me to let it go?
My head hurts.
You think.
Stefan, what are you doing here?
Is Vicki home?
Yeah.
Can I see her please?
Dot's let him in, I don't want him in here.
Did he do something to you?
No, I just don't want him in here.
Just let me come in, so I can explain myself.
I don't know what's going on, but I think you'd leave now.
Matt, please.
No, Stefan.
You get to call me, Vicki.
I don't get what's going on with you. Just call me, please.
So, do you wanna hang out tonight?
We can go to the Halloween thing at school.
It could be fun.
Good, sure, sounds...sounds fun,
Can't wait.
I know you are upset about Vicki.
I heard you called mad.
But you can't be with her.
She needs you to get better.
The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
What does that even mean let her go.
Oh, ok, sure, she was such an expert on letting people go, right?
I know you may not see it yet.
But trust me, Jer, it's for the best.
For months from Mum and Dad dead, I feel like a crap.
Well, nothing really even matter a crap.
Now all of a sudden, I got these moments,
And things started to feel just a little bit better,
And Vicki was in every single one of them.
So you may not see it.
But trust me. Keeping me away from her is not for the best.
Seidel? For the ladies? Is a lot with special.
No way,
Last year I was hang over untill Thanksgiving.
Wait, I am going to drink
Untill someone is hot enough to make out with me.
Sounds like a plan.
How many Martinies have you had?
Ahh, don't stuck with me.
Can we go now? We are leaving for the Halloween party.
Let's go.
So go ahead.
I'd like to finish my drink.
Let me guess.
Dessie Becanon.
I love the guess-beaten look.
I've met you before.
Aren't you Caroline Phobos' boyfriend?
No, she had the school girl's crush on me.
It's cute. But I had to let her down. Easy.
It's Damon, right?
Oh, you remember me.
You have a face that's hard to forget.
What's your last name, Damon?
Salvatore
Are you in any relation with Zach?
Zach is my uncle.
How do you know Zach?
Are you ok?
Yes, because something is in my eye.
Well, I know Zach from the Founders' Council.
You know, the Salvatores were born in this town's Original saddles.
Yes, they were.
I wasn't aware that Zach was remembered.
I just recently come back home
And really haven't had chance to meet any of these friends.
Would you tell him to return my calls.
I've left several messages.
Zach were out of the town. It's forbiden.
But if it is about the vervain
You know about the vervain?
Well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do.
Of course.
Cheers.
You wear Plastic Surgery costum too. Ah?
Yes, I just didn't know any other clothes coming to me
Untill an hour ago.
Me either.
And you are going as... you?
He's not talking to me right now. We've gotten into a fight.
I got into with Vicki too when she got home.
I tried not to stuck with her tonight, but...
Part of me just din't want her out of my sight.
She's here?
Yes, you can't miss her. She's a vampire.
Oh, where did Jeremy go?
Elena, what's the matter?
I'm going. I got to find him.
What? You're following me now?
You don't really give me much of the choic.
Let me out of here.
You shouldn't have been here.
Crowds like this will make it even harder for you
To make yourself under control.
I'm fine.
Really?
No headache? Your stomach has not agonized you?
Not feeling light headed? Or anxiouse or cranky?
Like if someboy look at you in a wrong way,
You can just rape their head off.
Do you know what's that called?
It's called hunger.
And it only will get worse and worse every minute.
That you pretend like it's not controling you.
So you need vervain?
Yes.
My husband and I only have flowers
Which his parents left him.
And Zach had promised
He could supply us with more.
Well, I talked to him all the time.
So why don't they just ask him?
How much you need, I mean how many people do you think?
Well, these are children, of course
Of course
And friends, family
And everyone on the council.
The council?
Zach knows how many.
You know, I am so late
My husband is not going to be happy with me.
Well, are you happy with your husband?
You're flirting with me.
You flirt with me first.
True.
Let me escort you to the school.
It's not safe out there alone.
I mean I've seen ten vampires tonight.
Only the real ones were easy to find.
How is that search going?
We had the Founders' Party.
And anyone arrived during the day
Was eliminated as supect.
And otherwise we were just dead and so.
I gonna go.
Ok
I gonna go.
Ok
Thank god.
What's the matter?
I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
What's going on?
Hey, uh, Everything's fine.
I told you to quit bothering me.
No, Viki. Don't do this.
Matt, He won't leave me alone.
You need the backoff, man.
Matt, it's..it's ok.
No! It's not ok. What the hell is your problem?
Stafen, she's gone.
I'm trying to help her.
Viki, you just scare me.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Ok.
So..Where'd Caroline ran up to?
Do yourself a favor, Damon.
Don't ask me about Caroline.
Oh, but Bonnie, so loyal.
Just stay away from her.
Where'd you get that?
From a friend.
Caroline?
You know that's mine, don't you?
Not any more.
Funny.
I'd like it back, please.
I'm not giving it to you.
I'll give it to Caroline. She can give to you if she feels like it.
Or I could just take it right now.
Jeremy
I was so worry about you.
I'm fine now, but...
I gotta leave.
What? Where?
I gotta get out of here, Jer.
I just, I can't live at home with Matt.
He jusr dosen't get it
No, You can't, You can't just leave.
Come with me.
If you come with me, we can be together foever.
Ok.
Yeah.
Really? I know it's so cool. I know it's awsome.
What? What is it?
Viki?
Viki. Viki. What the hell?
Oh, my god!
No! Stop!
No!
Viki! No!
No.
Vicki
Go, get inside,
Go!
Vicki
Vicki
Vicki
Vicki
Get him out of here.
What?
I need your help.
What happened to you?
I did something I don't know.
It came from my necklace.
Where'd you get that?
It's part my costume, it's piece of junk.
That piece of junk belongs to
One of the most powerful witches of our family.
Let me show you.
There she is.
Emily Bennet.
Your great great great great grandmother.
And there is your necklace.
You should go. I got this.
You did this. This is your fault.
You confuse me for someone with remorse.
None of this matters to me.
None of it.
People die around you. How could it not matter?
It matters and you know it.
You need to leave.
Your wounds are bleeding.
And you need to leave.
Elena. Hey! Have you seen...
Whoa. What... what happened?
Nothing. Some idiot with some fake blood got me.
I'm gonna go home and shower.
I can't find Vicki. She totally bailed on me.
I don't know where she is.
Is this what I'm in for a lifetime of worrying about her?
You're a good brother, Matt.
Yeah. Maybe she went home.
Maybe...
Okay.
Where is he?
Inside.
Do you understand what happened tonight?
No...
I don't understand. I mean I know what I saw, but...
I don't understand.
She was going to kill me.
Now she is dead. Vicki is dead.
I...I'm so sorry. Jer.
Make it stop. It hurts.
Shh,Shh, Shh. It's okay...It's okay.
Why does everybody have to die on me?
Oh, my god. Come here.
Are you ok?
I...uh...I wanted to help her.
But, instead...uh...
How's he doing?
He's a mess.
I don't want him going through this again.
He is just a kid.
Elena, what can I do?
What can I do to help? I'll do anything..
Can you make him forget?
I can't do that.
Stefan, please!
I don't know how he'll ever get past this?
I just want him to forget everything that happened.
If I did. There's no guarantee that it would work.
Because of who I am. Because of how I live.
I don't have the ability do it right.
I can do it.
If this is what you want.
I'll do it.
It's what I want.
What you want me now?
I want you to tell him...
That Vicki left town.
And she's not coming back.
That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her.
He's gotta miss her,
But he's know that's for the best.
Part of me wishes that I could forget, too...
Forget meeting you.
Finding out what you are
And everthing that's happened since.
If that's what you want.
Yes, it is.
Because I don't want it to be like this.
I don't wanna feel like this.
But I can't.
With everything that's happend...
I can't lose the way I feel about you.
