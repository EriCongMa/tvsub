i have a question about batman .
batman is a man who dresses up like a bat .
man @-@ bat is a part man , part bat hybrid .
now , if man @-@ bat dressed up as a man to fight crime ,
would he be man @-@ batman ?
no , he &apos;d be bat @-@ man @-@ bat .
but wouldn &apos;t man @-@ batman just be a batman
that was bitten by a radioactive man ?

but batman is a man .
you &apos;re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man .
that &apos;s just man @-@ man .
well , isn &apos;t man @-@ man just man ?
but what if man @-@ man dressed as a bat ?
well , that &apos;s just batman .
no , if a man dresses as a bat ,
that &apos;s batman , but if man @-@ man dresses as a bat ,
that &apos;s batman @-@ man .
so does that answer your question ?
oh , i haven &apos;t asked it yet .
oh , that &apos;s claire . got to run .
i thought you were back with emily .
uh , actually i &apos;m ... seeing both of them .
you mean like through their window from behind a bush ?
no , i &apos;m actually dating two women .
later .
really ?
the guy who for years couldn &apos;t even talk to women
is suddenly going out with two of them ?
how is that possible ?
i know .
scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models ,
but , in each case , the world blows up .
seriously , that guy &apos;s dating two women ?
what , why did you get a party sub ?
people are coming over ; it looked fun .
well , we &apos;re only watching game of thrones .
a party sub implies it &apos;s a party .
your attendance implies it &apos;s not .
i like a party as much as the next man ,
as long as the next man doesn &apos;t like a party .
oh , by the way , don &apos;t forget ,
tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting .
oh , sheldon , we don &apos;t need a meeting every three months .
well , it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up
at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting .
lucky for you it &apos;s tomorrow .
oh , you know what ? i &apos;m not going .
well , you have to go .
it &apos;s penny &apos;s first time leading the pledge of allegiance .
this meeting is a waste of time .
whether we make the switch
from post raisin bran to kellogg &apos;s raisin bran
should not require parliamentary procedure .
you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins .
you &apos;re the only one who eats them !
and yet you get to weigh in .
democracy-- it &apos;s pretty cool , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m not going ; you can &apos;t make me .
well , we &apos;ll just see about that .
what is the problem ?
he says he &apos;s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow .
well , why the hell did i memorize the pledge ?
you have fun . i will not be attending .
oh , fine . we don &apos;t have to have
a roommate agreement meeting if you don &apos;t want to .
thank you .
of course , it will require a vote .
unfortunately , my official gavel is in my bedroom ,
but luckily , i have my travel gavel .
you &apos;re being ridiculous .
there &apos;s a motion on the floor , &quot; i &apos;m ridiculous . &quot;
do we have a second ?
there is no second .
the motion is denied .
next time , make sure you have the votes first .
that was embarrassing .
can you please talk to him ?
well , why are you fighting him on this ?
because i am tired of him always getting his way .
we don &apos;t need a stupid meeting .
we don &apos;t even need a roommate agreement ,
and i hope that sandwich does cause a party !
well , i will still come to your meeting .
well , i should hope so . tomorrow &apos;s picture day .
why are you taking his side ?
because it &apos;s important to him ,
and when we signed the roommate agreement , we made a deal .
y @-@ you keep talking like that , you &apos;re gonna make color guard .
man , i &apos;m worn out .
i know .
imagine if we were actually moving .
no , it &apos;s just , ever since i started dating
claire and emily at the same time , it &apos;s exhausting .
you &apos;re exhausted ?
try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book
so your wife thinks you read it .
but , dude , you &apos;re so lucky .
getting to stay home at night with the woman you love .
i guess i am lucky .
you are , because dating two women ,
i mean , i can &apos;t even remember
the last time i slept in my own apartment .
i wake up and i &apos;m like , &quot; am i at claire &apos;s or am i at emily &apos;s ?
is there a third girl i &apos;ve forgotten about ? &quot;
like ...
&quot; where am i ? &quot;
hey , raj .
hey , how &apos;s the mommy @-@ to @-@ be ?
good . a little tired .
i feel you . i &apos;ve been dating multiple women .
you sure you don &apos;t want to come watch game of thrones with us ?
you guys have fun .
i &apos;m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book .
oh , that sounds great-- a bed to yourself .
can &apos;t even remember what that &apos;s like .
are you up @-@ to @-@ date on game of thrones ?
mm , i think so .
dragons , snow zombies ,
and all the hot guys are dead .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
theon greyjoy looks pretty good
for a guy who had his genitals cut off .
uh @-@ oh , somebody &apos;s still pouting .
leave me alone .
if it &apos;s because you lost a stick ,
i know where it went .
not funny .
you know you &apos;re gonna make up with him .
can we just skip to that part ?
oh , of course , because i &apos;m the only adult around here .
really ? the only adult ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
tonight i &apos;ll be watching a show rated m.a. ,
and that stands for &quot; mature audiences , &quot; buster .
all right , you would think &quot; the only adult &quot;
wouldn &apos;t let something silly ruin our entire night .
and i &apos;d think you &apos;d understand why i &apos;m annoyed .
all this could be avoided if you &apos;d just come to the meeting .
i don &apos;t want to .
oh , it &apos;s just a meeting .
one simple meeting .
stop saying &quot; meeting &quot; !
* meeting , meeting , bo @-@ beeting *
* banana @-@ fana , fo @-@ feeting *
* fee @-@ fi mo @-@ meeting ... *
i brought my famous spinach dip .
yo , amy , just one second .
* meeting . *
i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;m hoping for a boy or a girl .
i mean , if it &apos;s a boy ,
i &apos;m gonna have to teach him to play catch .
which means i &apos;m gonna have to google &quot; how to play catch . &quot;
if it &apos;s a girl , i mean ...
they &apos;re so innocent and ...
you know how guys are .
totally , guys are the worst .
i mean , look at me .
i let emily make me a frittata
and i kept the leftovers in claire &apos;s fridge that night .
i &apos;m such a dog .
there you go again .
i &apos;m sorry , have i been complaining about it too much ?
actually , what you &apos;re doing is pretending to complain ,
but really trying to brag .
how could you say that ?
&quot; oh , i wish could enjoy a cup of tea
without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me . &quot;
i never said that .
&quot; don &apos;t you hate it when you can &apos;t remember whose bra it is
you found wedged in your couch ? &quot;
okay , that i said .
but that &apos;s a real problem !
you give a girl another woman &apos;s bra ,
and you will not be having sex with her that night .
maybe the other girl , but not her .
what &apos;s going on with him ?
oh , he &apos;s all bent out of shape
about having a roommate agreement meeting .
apparently , perfect attendance isn &apos;t cool anymore .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll come around .
well , i get why he &apos;s annoyed .
well , then you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
see ...
leonard refused to participate
in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting .
this is what a generation raised on bart simpson looks like .
you love the simpsons .
i love lisa simpson .
well , i know how he feels .
i never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings .
wait .
you were pretending ?
sorry .
no !
i don &apos;t believe you . i could tell .
&quot; oh , sheldon ,
i never thought re @-@ filing a matter
in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating . &quot;
hmm , what do you think ?
you don &apos;t know ?
hey , did i say something to upset you ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
really ? because usually we walk side by side ,
and i just went up two flights of stairs
staring at your bottom .
just drop it .
okay , i think i see what &apos;s happening here .
you &apos;re jealous of me .
oh , please .
what could you possibly have that i would be jealous of ?
it &apos;s not what i have ,
it &apos;s how many people i &apos;m having it with .
come on , sheldon , we &apos;ll watch game of thrones over here .
gladly .
oh , good , go . you know , it &apos;ll be nice to
watch an episode without someone saying ,
&quot; i read the books .
don &apos;t get too fond of this character . &quot;
it &apos;s not always because they die .
in one case , it &apos;s because they &apos;ve become involved
with underground tree people from the dawn of time .
yeah , but i won &apos;t say who it is .
it &apos;s bran !
wait , what is going on ?
leonard &apos;s being a jerk , so we &apos;re gonna watch over here ,
do you guys want to watch with us ?
as long as i don &apos;t have to watch with him .
fine , i don &apos;t want to watch with you either .
i &apos;ll go over here .
why do you get to pick ?
okay , then you go there !
don &apos;t tell me where to go !
howard , just come in here .
yeah , come on , raj .
wait , did amy make her spinach dip ?
she did .
and i &apos;m gonna eat it all !
so what the hell happened ?
oh , i just ran out of patience with sheldon &apos;s nonsense .
tell me about it . i &apos;ve had it with raj , too .
you know , like women ,
men have a monthly hormone cycle .
dips in testosterone can cause irritability .
interesting .
maybe my male cycle synced up
with raj &apos;s actual period .
if sheldon &apos;s testosterone dipped , he &apos;d become a butterfly .
maybe someone &apos;s here to apologize .
hey , leonard .
stuart .
is this not a dress @-@ up party ?
no .
was it ever a dress @-@ up party ?
no .
howard , didn &apos;t you tell me it was a dress @-@ up party ?
yeah .
i was told this is where to go if i &apos;m mad at howard .
may i take your cloak ?
thanks .
this thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike .
well , i &apos;ll catch you up .
uh , penny is angry at leonard , leonard &apos;s angry at me and penny ,
i &apos;m angry at leonard and amy ,
raj is angry at howard ,
and i &apos;m angry at george r.r. martin
&apos;cause there are no new books for me to spoil for leonard .
so what happened with you and howard ?
says i was talking too much about dating claire and emily ,
and i accused him of being jealous .
i &apos;m jealous .
closest i &apos;ve come to dating two women
was that time i dated one woman .
i don &apos;t know how you put up with it .
he &apos;s impossible . i mean , holding a meeting
to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy .
yeah . cap &apos;n crunch with crunch berries , move on .
anyway , amy , thank you for sticking up for me .
oh , i honestly couldn &apos;t care less .
sorry ?
well , i just took your side &apos; cause sometimes i get annoyed
at how close sheldon and penny are .
well , they argue all the time .
they aren &apos;t that close .
who &apos;s always comforting him when he &apos;s upset ?
penny , but ...
who &apos;s the only one
who can make him take his medicine when he &apos;s sick ?
i try to hide it in his peanut butter ,
but he spits it out .
okay .
and did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement
so she can get her way and not fight with you about it ?
son of a bitch .
why is that funny ?
i don &apos;t know . i like the pain of others .
oh , then you &apos;ll enjoy this .
bernadette does the same thing with you and koothrappali .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
she defends him all the time .
she does not .
who told you to stop making all those gandhi jokes about him ?
well , she did .
and human resources .
who do you think told koothrappali to go to human resources ?
son of a bitch .
you &apos;re right , it feels good .
all right , it &apos;s almost game time .
get it ?
game of thrones , game time ?
two women , huh ?
oh , perhaps it &apos;s amy coming to her senses .
what &apos;s up ?
you know , you don &apos;t need to use sheldon to get your way with me
in a dumb roommate agreement .
where &apos;d you get that from ?
from amy .
ugh . amy , why did you tell him that ?
because you were defending sheldon like you always do .
i don &apos;t always defend sheldon .
oh , yes , you do . you know you have a weird
brother @-@ sister @-@ elliott @-@ e.t. relationship with him .
与e.t.感情深厚的男主角
what about your weird relationship with him ?
that &apos;s different .
i &apos;m like the little girl in poltergeist
and he &apos;s the creepy thing in the tv .
um , guys ?
were there any nuts in that food ?
i don &apos;t think so . why ? well ...
just a feeling .
it just said &quot; italian sub . &quot;
i had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it .
interesting fact :
in italian , the &quot; morta &quot; in &quot; mortadella &quot; means death .
sheldon .
i didn &apos;t say &quot; fun &quot; fact . i &apos;m not a monster .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
now it &apos;s a fun fact .
boy , stuff like this really puts things in perspective .
why are you dressed like that ?
oh , uh , howard thought it &apos;d be funny
to tell me it was a costume party .
that wasn &apos;t nice .
no , but he almost died , so we &apos;re cool .
you know , if you think about it , tonight was kind of like
a real @-@ life game of thrones .
how ?
well , howard eating that pistachio
was like when king joffrey got poisoned .
okay , well , that was murder , this was an accident .
okay .
but you using sheldon to do your dirty work
is like when cersei used the king &apos;s guard to do her bidding .
cersei uses her body to manipulate men .
penny just takes me to the lego store .
okay . oh , how about this ?
stuart &apos;s dressed like a brother of the night &apos;s watch ,
and they don &apos;t have sex .
there you go .
that &apos;s true .
fair enough .
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
just a little embarrassed i had to be carried down the stairs
like a baby .
thanks .
let &apos;s get out of here .
that was scary .
well , the important thing is
i said that big sandwich would ruin everything ,
and i was right .
hey , jon snow !
how come your horse has a basket on it ?
how come your head has your face on it ?
they don &apos;t wear bicycle helmets in game of thrones .
you &apos;re thematically inaccurate ,
but i applaud your commitment to safety .
don &apos;t you guys have anything better to do ?
better than watching a guy in a fur cloak
ride a girl &apos;s bike ? nope .
that &apos;s it ,
you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store .
horse has a basket on it . stupid ...
leonard .
leonard . leonard .
what ?
i never got to ask my question about batman .
what is it ?
if batman were bitten by a radioactive man @-@ bat ,
and then fought crime disguised as man @-@ bat ,
would he be man @-@ bat @-@ man @-@ bat @-@ man
or simply man @-@ bat @-@ man @-@ bat @-@ batman ?
is he still wearing the batman suit under the man @-@ bat suit ?
