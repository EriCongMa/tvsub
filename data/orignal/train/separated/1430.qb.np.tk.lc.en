it &apos;s so unfair . you told me i could go .
i told you you could go if you
got a b on your history exam , which you didn &apos;t .
i have a learning disability .
the letters jump around on the page
and appear backwards .
honey , we had you tested like six times .
trust me , i was praying for dyslexia .
oh , my god , why can &apos;t you ever let me have any fun ? !
ew . ew . dad , gross .
your hand smells like cheese !
i didn &apos;t want to dirty a knife . sit .
now , we all know when nana dede comes to visit ,
your mom can get a little ...
psycho ?
scary .
drunk ?
all true .
therefore , i need you guys to be on your best behavior .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll keep to myself .
i have to practice for my cello recital .
ohh , fine .
you know what ? if it keeps you out of your mom &apos;s hair , yes ,
do that .
luke , if your mom starts to lose it ,
i need you to lighten the mood by being extra cute .
no problem . i &apos;ve got some stuff prepared .
&quot; hey , mom , i &apos;m firsty . &quot;
heh ? adorable , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s good .
don &apos;t worry . it works better in my jammies .
cam , monica can &apos;t come to lily &apos;s birthday party this weekend .
her mom &apos;s gonna be in chicago .
oh , that &apos;s fantastic ! what part is she playing ?
the city of chicago .
okay . gun to your head ...
which pair should i wear ?
oh . gun to my head .
i &apos;d say , pull the trigger .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
no fizbo .
okay , w @-@ why ? !
c @-@ cam , the center of attention at lily &apos;s party should be lily ,
not fizbo the needy clown .
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me . &quot; needy &quot; ?
&quot; why aren &apos;t they laughing , mitchell ?
&quot; why aren &apos;t they clapping
when i &apos;m pulling the handkerchief out of my mouth ? &quot;
it &apos;s 10 feet long
with boxer shorts at the end .
it works on so many levels .
yeah . well , also ,
it &apos;s a princess theme party , so ...
i guess you just don &apos;t respect party themes .
you did not just say that .
i &apos;m sorry . that was ... that was crossing a line .
yes , it was .
so ? can fizbo come to the party ?
no ! no !
you are lily &apos;s dad . just be there as her dad .
are you implying i &apos;m not being a good dad now ?
well , if the shoe fits ...
they don &apos;t . they &apos;re comically large .
hey , mom .
dad and nana just pulled in .
claire bear !
ohh . oh , my sweet girl !
gosh , i forget that you &apos;re all grown up .
you know , in my mind , you &apos;re still 12 .
well , look at us ... just two old ladies .
we &apos;re home !
oh , good .
and we bought lily a beautiful birthday gift .
yeah . i was pushing for a cashmere throw .
look , jay . it &apos;s a talking storybook .
we record ourselves reading it ,
and then at night ,
lily can hear our voices before she goes to sleep .
terrible idea .
unlike the timelessness of cashmere .
enough with the cashmere !
why is it a terrible idea ?
don &apos;t you remember the answering @-@ machine message ?
hi , you &apos;ve reached jay ...
and gloria .
please leave a message after the ...
you didn &apos;t say &quot; beep . &quot;
if i say &quot; beep , &quot;
then the people will think it &apos;s the beep .
no , i think they &apos;re gonna know to wait for the actual beep .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;ll know .
just trust me .
okay , fine .
hi , you &apos;ve reached jay ...
and gloria .
please leave a message after the beeeeeep !
what was that ?
you told me to make the beep .
no , i didn &apos;t tell you to make the beep .
i told you to say the word &quot; beep . &quot;
if i say the word ,
then people think it &apos;s the beep .
it &apos;s not the beep !
then why even say it ? !
so , anyways ,
you &apos;ll never guess who i saw at the airport .
mm . who &apos;s that ?
robbie sullivan .
robbie ... my robbie sullivan from high school ?
god , i haven &apos;t seen him in ... years .
decades , really .
i always liked him .
and as i recall ,
the two of you couldn &apos;t keep your hands off each other .
oh , really , mom ?
that &apos;s ... not true .
it is true . i read it in your diary .
you read my diary !
well ... yeah .
i @-@ i read it
because i wanted to see if you were on drugs .
it &apos;s called parenting , claire .
so , mom , what &apos;s going on with chad ...
okay , buddy .
we &apos;re gonna need you on the front lines sooner than expected .
are you ready to be cute ?
please .
go get &apos; em .
hi , mommy . my tummy &apos;s growling .
can i have some pas @-@ ghetti ?
sweetie , you &apos;re hurting me .
and take a shower tonight . your hair smells like cheese .
i &apos;ll get it .
okay , i need a giant lollipop ,
and i need it now .
oh , there &apos;s my girl !
oh , my god .
robbie ? !
look at you !
surprise !
i invited him to dinner !
what ?
didn &apos;t i tell you she &apos;d be excited ?
huh ? i ... uh @-@ huh .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , maybe a fuzzy navel wine cooler will loosen you up .
sure used to .
hey , honey , who &apos;s this ?
this is , um ...
robbie ...
my boyfriend from when i was 17 years old ,
whom my mom invited to dinner .
fasten your seatbelts .
phil dunphy .
hey , phil . how do you know claire ?
i know claire from being married to claire .
wait a minute . uh ...
mom didn &apos;t mention that i &apos;m married
with three kids ?
no . all she said
was that you were still trying to figure out your life .
really ?
yeah .
okay . mom ?
dede ?
aren &apos;t we all ?
uh , no . not really .
why would you not mention that i &apos;m married ?
oh , god , claire .
not everything in a conversation is about you .
mom ...
... i could use some help in the kitchen .
your words , not mine .
you came here in a limo ?
yep . that &apos;s right , little dude .
are you rich ?
luke , that &apos;s not polite .
maybe robbie isn &apos;t rich ,
but he needs a limo because he has a lot of duis .
nope . it &apos;s nothing like that .
the truth is , luke , i am rich ,
but not with money .
i &apos;ve got my abs ,
i &apos;ve got my hair ,
and i &apos;ve got a super @-@ sweet job driving that limo outside .
cool .
it is cool .
hey , luke , who &apos;s taller ?
me or your dad ?
oh ... i don &apos;t think we need to ...
i am just wearing socks , buddy .
i just don &apos;t understand why you invited him to my house .
because he &apos;s an old friend .
what was i gonna do ... not invite him ?
yes . yes .
sweetheart , i don &apos;t know about you ,
but that is not the way i was raised .
you raised me .
you &apos;re overthinking this .
i was thinking that it might be a hoot
for you to see him again .
and did you think it might be a hoot to ask me first ?
no . if i &apos;d asked you , you would have said no .
of course , mom . of course i would have said no .
oh . and i &apos;m the bad guy .
honestly , claire ,
i wish i had a tape recorder .
&quot; once upon a time , there lived a family of bears .
&quot; there was papa bear ... &quot;
that &apos;s you , jay .
ah . okay . let &apos;s see .
do you want me to hold it and stand in the driveway ?
&quot; holy mackerel , this is good salmon . &quot;
i feel like they missed an oppor ...
&quot; i don &apos;t want to eat the fish .
they are my friends ! &quot;
what kind of voice is that ?
i am a bear .
a bear ?
i was gonna get a crucifix .
&quot; and then the baby bear said ... &quot;
&quot; good night , mama . good night , papa .
this has been the best day ever . &quot;
&quot; and after she kissed her parents good night ,
&quot; she drifted off to sleep .
&quot; the end . &quot;
she ? baby bear &apos;s a girl ?
we have to do it over .
i would have played it totally different .
i think you nailed it .
and what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
manny , you &apos;re fine .
but , jay , i need to tell you something .
it &apos;s a bear , gloria . i did the best i could .
no . i don &apos;t want you to get upset about this ,
but i &apos;m not going to the party .
what ?
yeah , it &apos;s because your ex @-@ wife is going to be there ,
and we &apos;re never good together .
i &apos;m feeling very nervous .
it &apos;s better that i stay here .
wow . i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
greatest news ever !
so you &apos;re okay with this ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t say i &apos;m okay with it , but i get it .
i feel like i &apos;m in the same boat with your friend &apos;s daughter &apos;s
first communion coming up .
i always felt like the husband never liked me .
maybe you &apos;re right .
i should probably skip it .
wait , wait , wait .
so robbie sullivan &apos;s at your house right now .
yes , he is having dinner with my family .
and let me tell you something .
this chick was fat .
every time he opens his mouth ,
i can feel my daughters losing respect for me .
you know , i never liked that guy .
he used to always put me in a headlock .
it is amazing the freaks we used to date .
&apos;ello , gov &apos;nah !
i gotta jump .
all right . let &apos;s hear it .
sir fizbo @-@ lot ,
royal court jester , at your service .
i understand there &apos;s a little princess
&apos;oos in need of a jolly good time !
no !
your &apos; ighness said that the clown
doesn &apos;t fit the princess theme .
but &quot; me finks ... &quot;
that a court jester is right as rain !
there goes the theory
that an english accent makes everyone sound smart .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s gonna be a boring party without any entertainment .
i agree , which is why i hired a princess .
cue the gasp .
how could you do that ? how dare you ? !
entertaining and delighting children is who i am .
just be a parent .
but i want to ...
go .
i want to ...
now . stop .
i was thinking about what you said ,
and maybe i should go to the party .
what &apos;d i say ? i didn &apos;t say anything .
about maria victoria &apos;s first communion .
we cannot let other people
make us miss important family events .
what ? i &apos;m gonna miss alex &apos;s graduation ,
all of haley &apos;s weddings , just because of dede ?
i love them . they &apos;re my family , too .
whoa , whoa . slow down .
you &apos;re up to weddings already ?
h @-@ h @-@ how about this ?
try missing tomorrow ,
and then just see how that feels .
ay , jay .
you &apos;re so good to me .
that &apos;s why i have to go .
you &apos;re gonna be there for me
the same way i &apos;m gonna be there for you
at maria victoria &apos;s first communion .
wait a minute . that &apos;s back on the table ?
well , you know , we didn &apos;t want to break curfew .
curfew ? !
oh , right .
as if you two ever honored a curfew .
i love your stories , nana . keep on goin &apos; .
your father used to scare the crap out of me .
well , evidently not enough to keep you from sneaking in
3 : 00 in the morning .
i didn &apos;t know whether to punish you
or make you pancakes .
hey , hey ! ha ha ha ha !
halfway through dinner , i told claire
that whenever she had the urge to lash out at her mother ,
she should just squeeze my hand instead .
a doctor had to cut off my wedding ring .
claire , you remember that time we cut school
and we went out to the pier ...
mm @-@ hmm .
... and we played that game , and you won the ...
giant panda bear !
the panda bear ... right .
yeah . yes .
yeah .
do you remember what we did after that ?
yes .
hey , do you still like roller coasters ?
not this one .
you know , robbie was a rogue ,
but he could charm your socks off .
although i doubt he stopped there .
wow , mom .
mom ?
we &apos;re all adults here , honey , pretty much .
okay , i think we &apos;re ... we &apos;re done .
yeah , well , i better get going .
i &apos;ve got an early @-@ morning run , celebrity client .
don &apos;t ask me who .
let &apos;s just say that if i &apos;m late ,
i &apos;ll be in jeopardy .
who is alex trebek ?
uh , he &apos;s a game @-@ show host . why ?
no reason .
claire .
yes ?
this was incredible . thanks a lot .
s @-@ so great . it was so great .
so good to see you .
i know .
catching up was so fun .
really good .
hey , you ... you take good care .
you take good care , now .
yes .
ohh , let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s do that .
i &apos;ll walk you out .
bye !
really , mom ?
i was young .
i thought he was sexy .
go to your room .
okay .
i did it .
she brought all the crazy in her arsenal ,
and i did not crack .
i think a bone in my hand did .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what hurt more ?
what ?
i used to think your mother loved me .
apparently , she always wished you &apos;d married robbie .
oh , no , sweetie .
this was all about her trying to annoy me .
come on . she &apos;s practically walking you two down the aisle .
his phone .
all those mother &apos;s day cards i sent her ...
all those joke e @-@ mails she forwarded to me
months after i &apos;d already seen them .
well , no more polite &quot; lols &quot; for you , dede .
oh ! oh ! holy cow !
wow . okay , well ...
you were right . it &apos;s not about me .
oh , god .
you are princess ...
stop eyeing the princess . you &apos;re gonna freak her out .
i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i think the whole idea of needing a prince to come along
and make you happy ,
sends the wrong message , mitchell .
i really do .
really ? and a grown man
pulling boxer shorts out of his mouth doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m ...
hey .
hi . hi . hi . hi . hi . hi . hi . hi .
hi . hi , sweetie .
hey , phil .
so ... where is she ? where &apos;s mom ?
yeah , let &apos;s get the weirdness over with .
oh , no . i thought she was coming with you .
oh , no , no .
i haven &apos;t seen mom since ... let &apos;s see ...
oh , she made out with my ex @-@ boyfriend last night .
what ?
yeah .
no , my god !
yeah . yeah .
and then she took off with him ,
didn &apos;t come back to the house until after i was asleep ,
and then this morning left a cute little note
that said , &quot; having breakfast with robbie ! &quot;
what the hell is she doing ? he &apos;s half her age !
don &apos;t say it .
i think it &apos;s sweet .
love is beautiful . it has no age .
when it &apos;s meant to be , it &apos;s meant to be .
that is the question .
dad , what &apos;s going on over there ?
she was a little nervous about your mother being here ,
so she tried her first xanax ,
washed it down with a shot of tequila .
ay , look at the princess . it &apos;s so beautiful .
really ? &apos; cause i don &apos;t see it .
excuse me .
there &apos;s the birthday girl !
glitter ?
that &apos;ll settle in her lungs .
so , i wanted to ask what method of payment you prefer ...
cash , credit card , check ?
why , princesses don &apos;t get paid ,
except maybe in laughter and sparkles .
that &apos;s nice . but i really need to know .
all i ask is that a little girl &apos;s birthday wishes ...
come true
miss , seriously ,
if you want to get paid , i need to ...
fine . you can make the check out to party stars incorporated .
never break character . never , ever !
but ...
&quot; but &quot; nothing .
when i was a clown , my shoe caught on fire ,
and one of my fellow clowns
put me out with a bucket of flammable confetti .
what &apos;s happening ?
even as they loaded me into the ambulance ,
i continued to make balloon animals !
flammable confetti ?
there was a seltzer bottle right there !
oh , hi !
i cannot believe it .
she brought him to the party !
oh , my god ! i &apos;m gonna kill her .
i &apos;m gonna ...
stop . no , not ... not now .
the last thing i need is some big scene , claire .
you know , she &apos;s doing this just to torture me .
no , no . she &apos;s doing this to get back at me
because i didn &apos;t let her stay with us .
you &apos;re both wrong . this is about me .
i got the young girl . she had to get the young guy .
well , she and i are good .
we had a long talk last night
after you and i &quot; split &quot; that bottle of wine ,
and you &quot; fell asleep &quot; on the stairs .
i don &apos;t know why everybody &apos;s getting so upset about this .
maybe it &apos;s about passion ,
about what the body wants ,
what the ... what the heart wants for the heart .
dad , seriously , can you
deal with cheech and chong ?
hi , everyone .
jay , gloria .
oh , buenos dias , dede ...
b @-@ buenos ...
uh , yeah . uh , gloria ...
come on .
that &apos;s enough .
hi , mom . hi .
oh , mitchell . mwah !
thank you for coming .
oh ! you remember robbie .
yes , i do . yes . hi .
oh ! that &apos;s lily !
oh ! i guess you &apos;re trying
to keep the outfit i sent her clean .
so , robbie ,
it looks like the years have been treating you good , huh ?
hey , what &apos;s up , red ?
okay . um ...
i love this guy . remember , we used to wrestle around
all the time ?
yeah . please stop . is my baby watching ?
good to see you , man .
i need to talk to you for a second .
let me just ...
... ask you a little something .
what are you doing with my mother ?
hey , i &apos;ve got a code .
what happens in the limo stays in the limo .
she &apos;s my mother !
look , i know this is all a little freaky ,
but i had a crush on your mother back in high school ,
and it &apos;s always been kind of a fantasy for me .
you were dating me and fantasizing about my mother ?
ohh , boy .
what ?
i think we both know what this is really all about .
uh , no .
you still want me .
oh , my god . are you insane ?
oh , what &apos;s going on here , you two ?
claire still wants me .
no . don &apos;t .
oh ... oh , i should &apos;ve seen this coming .
oh , really .
one minute she sees i &apos;m happy ,
and she swoops in !
didn &apos;t swoop !
i didn &apos;t swoop . if anybody swooped , it was you !
you swooped !
claire , hush . not now ! not now !
not now . no , stop , please .
she accused me of trying to steal my old boyfriend from her .
okay , fine , but make it quick .
why does everything have to be so hard with you ?
why can &apos;t you just be a normal old grandma ? !
why do you ... you come in here ,
it &apos;s some sort of sick game for you
to just push people and push people and push people
and see how far you can push them !
and so fine ... look at me !
you win ! you win !
i &apos;m screaming at a princess party , mom !
claire . claire ...
i &apos;m screaming
at a princess party !
claire , claire , claire , claire .
robbie ?
i think maybe , you know , you should take off .
yeah , yeah , look , i hear you , phil .
uh , but between you and me ...
i &apos;m getting some serious vibes
from the princess over here ,
and i &apos;d kind of like to play that out .
hey . time to go .
hey , mr. p. how you been ?
i &apos;m doing good .
but i never liked you in the basement with my daughter ,
and i don &apos;t like you here with my ex .
you know , your little intimidation game
may have worked on me when i was a kid ,
but i &apos;m a full @-@ grown man now ...
and i think i should go .
so much for keeping it all about lily .
well , yeah , and i certainly didn &apos;t help
by berating that perfectly sweet journeyman princess like i did .
oh , god , look at this place .
everybody &apos;s traumatized .
oh , we need somebody to
pump some life back into this party , huh ?
i got this . i &apos;ll go in and turn on some music ,
bring out the cupcakes , pump up the bubble machine .
or ...
is that a roundabout way of saying
a certain clown can come to the party ?
i was wrong .
every kid wants a clown for a dad .
oh ! you just made a little girl very happy .
yes , well , i can see that .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i will be fine .
&apos;cause you know claire gets stressed out .
that stuff she said out there ...
was all true .
yeah .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking with him .
i feel like such a fool .
you got flattered by the attention of a younger guy ,
and you got a little carried away .
so what ?
it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s ... i divorced you ,
because i was looking for something else .
i haven &apos;t found it .
but when i come back here ,
i feel like i have to prove something .
like people are looking at me ,
saying , &quot; you broke up the family .
what do you have to show for it ? &quot;
you did the right thing .
we were stalled .
i didn &apos;t have the guts to end it .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re a decent man .
and that doesn &apos;t make it any easier .
i just don &apos;t want to be thought of as &quot; crazy nana . &quot;
that &apos;s not really who i am .
i think , more than anything else ,
my real problem ...
is her !
huh ?
no , dede !
so , maybe it isn &apos;t about me ?
or me .
i told you it was about me !
no ! no !
i got gloria !
i got gloria !
this is such a precious gift !
i know . i can &apos;t believe my dad sat down and did this .
keep going .
jay , pay attention . it &apos;s your line !
i just had a damn line .
manny , freshen this up for me .
no , no more drinks until we finish this .
who cares ? cam &apos;s just gonna return it anyway .
