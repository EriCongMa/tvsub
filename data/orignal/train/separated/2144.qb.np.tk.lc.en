can i help you ?
oh , no . i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just a flat tire .
i &apos;ve got a tow truck coming .
are you sure ?
i can give you a hand fixing that .
oh , no , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve got it under control .
don &apos;t worry about it .
look , the tow truck &apos;s coming .
glad you &apos;re here .
please tell me you &apos;re with the tow truck company .
partner , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t be there
in person to tell you this ,
but i need to find joe white .
i think he lied to me about the identity of shelburne ...
it was me .
... and i need to get the truth .
what , what happened ? who was it ?
shelburne is the real reason my father was murdered
and maybe even my mother .
and until i get some answers ,
i can &apos;t do this job right .
danno , i &apos;m going to need you to hold down the fort for a while .
i &apos;ll be in touch . mahalo .
mahalo .
danny .
is this no @-@ knock policy some sort of an island thing ?
no , and i &apos;m not here as a friend .
i &apos;m here as a taxpayer . i got an emergency .
well , then call 911 .
a menu , i &apos;m not hungry . thank you .
other side , look . that &apos;s the list of my suspects .
what do you mean suspects ?
what are you talking about ?
somebody stole my shrimp truck .
okay , um , i &apos;ll play along .
uh . why , uh , would somebody want to
steal your shrimp truck , kamekona ?
that &apos;s your job ! i need you to figure it out .
figure out what ? i &apos;m guessing that there &apos;s not a major demand
for a big yellow truck with your face on it .
well , i was hoping for some preferential five @-@ o treatment
due to the nature of our relationship , but ...
preferential ...
okay , um ...
pretty sure you &apos;re aware of this ,
but we are a major crimes task force , okay ?
we don &apos;t exactly do missing shrimp trucks .
major crime . this is super @-@ major crime !
all my secret recipes is in there .
excuse me-- secret ?
what are you , orville redenbacher ?
it &apos;s no secret .
you got garlic , you got butter ,
and you got shrimp . that &apos;s it .
yo , it &apos;s all about the proportions .
you know how much those recipes are worth ?
i have no idea .
priceless , brah .
okay . i will , uh ... i will do my best to help you out , okay ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me , my phone &apos;s ringing .
excuse me .
hello ?
yeah , uh , i &apos;m on my way .
hey , where &apos;s mcgarrett ?
he left a &quot; dear danny &quot; note on my desk this morning .
he &apos;s off looking for shelburne again .
so , he just picked up and left ?
guy &apos;s on a mission . what are you going to do ?
all right .
let &apos;s hope he gets some answers .
yes .
what do we got ?
farm workers found her this morning .
got an id ?
no , nothing .
it &apos;s a good place to dump a body .
good morning , max .
cause of death ?
hey , max ?
cause of death ? time of death ?
anything , please ?
max , hello ?
cause of death is manual asphyxiation
due to chest constriction .
that &apos;s it ?
max , how about an approximate time of death ?
yes , um , i &apos;m sorry .
uh , time of death is somewhere between 10 : 00 and midnight .
and she wasn &apos;t killed here .
you okay , buddy ?
yeah .
i just need to get her back to the morgue .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
yeah , we &apos;re on our way .
that was kono . she might have found the victim &apos;s car .
all right , so i ran the vehicle &apos;s registration .
i got a dmv photo .
is that your victim ?
yes .
angela o &apos;hara ,
23 . she lived with her mother in pearl city .
car had a flat .
this is a hell of a place to break down .
she didn &apos;t have a spare ?
no , she called for a tow around 8 : 30 last night .
but when the truck arrived ,
there was no driver present ,
so they left .
all right , looks to me like there &apos;s a crime opportunity .
killer drives by , sees this lady .
she &apos;s broken down .
cuz , you got something ?
this flat was no accident .
somebody put a razor blade in her tire tread .
her killer planned this .
ms. o &apos;hara , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
uh , there &apos;s just some questions i have to ask you
that can help with our investigation , okay ?
is that all right ?
i knew something was wrong .
i got a call from ... her work
saying that angela missed her shift .
where did she work ?
mana kai catamaran .
they do those , uh ,
those sightseeing boat tours around the island .
did she suffer ?
did my daughter suffer ?
oh , my god .
um , could you , uh ...
do you remember what time she left for work ?
she left earlier than usual .
okay , i know this is , uh ,
really difficult for you . um ...
but if you could tell me , uh , anything ,
anything that you remember , uh ,
anything she might have mentioned ,
it would be really helpful .
she got a ... she got a phone call
right before she left for work .
and she came to tell me that she was leaving ...
and i didn &apos;t even ...
i didn &apos;t look up to say good @-@ bye !
okay .
does the company that she work for , are they , uh ...
are they up on the north shore ?
no , they were in waikiki .
okay , uh ...
a long away from where we found her car .
is there anything you might know why
she &apos;d be up there on the north shore ?
no , no , i don &apos;t know .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , guys , i got something .
looks like our vic was being followed .
i found a gps tracking device under her car .
i believe this model has a web site
that allows users to monitor the gps remote .
okay . well , let &apos;s pull up an ip address .
see who was monitoring our victim .
so , we traced the gps
we found on angela o &apos;hara &apos;s car
back to an ip address registered to this guy .
cal litoa .
okay , so this guy &apos;s tracking her the whole time .
mm @-@ hmm , according to the gps , the last place she stopped
before her car broke down was a bar on the north shore .
okay , i bet that is where he put the razor blade in her tire .
matches up with fong &apos;s estimates too .
okay , tell me about this guy . what do we know ?
all right ...
cal litoa ...
misdemeanor possession charge ...
last year it looks like his ex @-@ girlfriend took out
a restraining order against him after he broke into her apartment
following an argument .
good .
uh , what is the connection to our victim angela o &apos;hara ?
there you go .
they both worked the mana kai catamaran .
listen to me . list ... don &apos;t move .
sit down and don &apos;t move .
we need you to tell us why you were tracking angela o &apos;hara .
i can explain .
good , good .
start with why we found her body in a pineapple field
up on the north shore .
my god . what ?
she &apos;s dead .
cal , listen to me .
we know it was your gps , but somebody--
i &apos;m not saying it was you-- i just want your help--
somebody put razor blades in her tire .
now , you see where this is going , don &apos;t you , cal ?
look , i admit i put the gps there ,
but i thought she was cheating on me .
she was your girlfriend ?
yeah .
we had to keep it on the down low ,
cause of work and her m @-@ mother .
her mother didn &apos;t like you ?
i can &apos;t imagine why not .
look , man ,
you got to believe me .
okay , relax . sit back and relax .
tell me something : when &apos;s the last time you spoke to her ?
last night .
she called , she said she ... was gonna be late to work .
she say why ?
no .
okay , so you followed her , found out
she was cheating on you , you did some bad things--
i understand .
no !
sit down ! don &apos;t stand up again , okay ?
i was working .
you can ask my manager .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go talk to your manager .
if i find out you &apos;re lying to me , i &apos;m gonna come back here ,
i &apos;m gonna put you in a mayonnaise jar .
okay ?
unbelievable .
manager says the kid didn &apos;t get off the boat till 10 : 30 .
you &apos;re good .
well , that &apos;s not enough time
to make it to the north shore ,
put razor blades in angela o &apos;hara &apos;s tires
and then wait for her to get a flat .
no , he &apos;s definitely not our guy .
yes , kamekona .
yo . any updates on my missing truck ?
missing truck ?
hey , uh , yeah , kono is all over it .
turns out that she has a nose for missing shrimp trucks .
90 % clearance rate , i believe .
plus , we have the female intuition thing going for us ,
so i think we &apos;re in good shape .
yes , she &apos;s making it a priority .
unbelievable . you know somebody stole
kamekona &apos;s shrimp truck ?
did you just volunteer kono ?
i did .
she know about this ?
no , she doesn &apos;t ,
and i would really appreciate some assistance here
seeing as this is a local crime ,
and i &apos;m not too hip to local crimes
like missing shrimp trucks .
wait a minute here .
oh , no , don &apos;t worry . we got leads .
really ? richie the shrimp guy ?
the duke brothers ?
oh , &quot; a disgruntled customer wearing a metallica shirt . &quot;
yeah . so you like the disgruntled customer
for this one or richie the shrimp guy ?
who steals a shrimp truck ?
i don &apos;t know . i said the same thing .
but that is the mission , should you choose to accept .
please .
all right , i &apos;ll make a couple of calls .
that &apos;s the least i can do .
thank you . and i will loop kono in .
we got to help the big guy , you know ?
plus , i am becoming very partial to garlic shrimp .
just a matter of time .
whoa , whoa , stop . what does that mean ?
plate lunches at local grinds .
you &apos;re practically ( speaks hawaiian ) , bro .
did i say that i was jumping aboard to any local customs , don ho ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
i just said that i liked the garlic shrimp .
which , in fact , is basically scampi .
and that is not island food at all ; it &apos;s italian .
yes , max ?
i &apos;ve completed the autopsy
and found some troubling anomalies .
what is this , a boy scout test ?
i failed the knots .
uh , no , detective .
it is a solomon bar rope cuff .
i took the liberty to mock one up .
it &apos;s a knot used to bind wrists ,
and as you can see ,
it has a very distinctive pattern ,
a pattern that matches exactly
the one we found on our victim &apos;s wrist ... and ankles .
but no ropes were found at the crime scene .
well , but i did recover some fiber ,
which leads me to believe that the killer removed the ropes
after he asphyxiated her .
which brings me to my second anomaly .
the victim &apos;s ribs were cracked
on both sides of the sternal bone .
ultrasound revealed that there was damage to the subclavian artery ,
which suggests that the killer knelt
on the victim and blocked her airways .
that , combined with the constricted lung capacity ,
caused her death .
okay , so we have a whack job
who likes to tie up women and smother them .
well , this is no whack job , detective williams .
this is a killer that left a distinct signature
and then attempted to hide or mitigate it .
it &apos;s the trashman .
very good , lieutenant kelly .
i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s the trashman ?
the m.o. is the exact same
as a serial killer dubbed the trashman .
he was known for discarding his victims in trash bags
along the side of the road .
that is correct .
the problem is , the trashman &apos;s in prison .
technically , a man named richard branch
was arrested for one of the murders .
okay , what do you mean , technically ?
you don &apos;t think he did it ?
no .
i believe the real trashman is still out there .
richard branch was accused of murdering six women .
the first one was
found on the h2 in 1985,
and the last one in 2009 .
shortly after that , he was arrested ,
convicted and sentenced to life .
each of his victims were bound ,
asphyxiated and dumped on the side of the road in trash bags .
as you can see , the injuries
are an exact match to our current victim , angela o &apos;hara .
all right , well , branch is in prison ,
so we must be looking for a copycat killer .
no , no , no .
then why remove the solomon bar cuff thingy , right ?
i mean , if he wanted us to think he was the trashman ,
he would &apos;ve left the ropes on , no ?
as i stated earlier ,
richard branch is not the trashman ,
and thus we are not looking for a copycat killer .
they arrested him .
they tried him and convicted him for the crimes , max .
yeah , but they were only able to tie him
to one of the trashman murders .
correct .
in order to ensure a conviction ,
the prosecuting attorney &apos;s office tried him
only for the murder of diane gallo ,
the last victim attributed to the trashman .
yeah , branch was a drifter ,
and he fit the profile .
plus , they found his dna on one of the trash bags
containing her body .
his file says they got an eyewitness ,
an eyewitness that puts this guy with the victim moments
before the crime takes place .
eyewitness testimonials are notoriously unreliable .
they got his dna , max ,
on one of the victims .
there &apos;s an alternate explanation
for the presence of richard branch &apos;s dna
at the crime scene .
time @-@ out , time @-@ out , time @-@ out .
why don &apos;t we just pay him a visit ?
i can arrange that .
you &apos;re in contact with richard branch ?
yes . we share an interest in acrostic puzzles .
why doesn &apos;t that surprise me ?
richard , this is detective danny williams
and lieutenant chin ho kelly from the five @-@ o task force .
good for them .
we found another body .
like i said , good for you .
max here believes that the real trashman
is still on the outside .
well , he ain &apos;t in here . that &apos;s for sure .
i am .
doing life .
next time i see the outside world ,
it &apos;ll be in a pine box .
detective williams and lieutenant kelly
are familiar with your case .
yeah , so were the cops who pinned all these murders on me
without a speck of evidence .
no , not without a speck of evidence .
your dna was on one of the victims .
i have ...
been over this a million times .
he killed again .
if we can prove that this is the trashman ,
they might reopen your case .
eh ... richard ...
this could help you .
okay , wh ... what do you want to know ?
so , how did your dna end up on the body of diane gallo ?
i was out looking for returnables
when i found the bag .
thought i &apos;d hit the jackpot ...
till i opened up the bag and reached in .
and you touched the body , huh ?
i &apos;ll never forget the look on that poor woman &apos;s face .
what that guy did to her .
okay , what &apos;d you do after that ?
this guy ...
drives by and sees me there with ... this woman &apos;s body
spilling out of the bag .
i saw that look in his face .
i knew .
so you ran ?
it doesn &apos;t take a genius
to pencil out how this was gonna end .
i had a record .
i knew the police were looking for this guy ,
and there i &apos;m standing over one of the victims ?
well , what about the eyewitness who saw you with the victim
before the murder ?
how the hell should i know ? !
i @-@ i fit the description : middle @-@ aged white guy !
truth ...
is , i never met that woman .
but those cops , now , they had a different version of events ,
and they kept me in that room all day
and all night until i signed that confession .
mr. branch was under the influence of narcotics .
and don &apos;t forget the vodka , max .
that ...
and this crappy attorney the court appointed me ,
and ...
well , let &apos;s just say ...
they had their guy .
you ready to go back ?
we &apos;re done .
thanks for the puzzles .
you heard from mcgarrett ?
called him a dozen times ,
left him a dozen messages .
hey ! what is this ?
what do you mean , what &apos;s this ?
adapting , overcoming , preserving my retail space .
you got a break in my case , or what ?
oh , yeah , uh , kono &apos;s , uh , running down some leads .
but in the meantime , could we have some garlic shrimp , please ?
reduced menu today .
barbecue shrimp only .
okay , we &apos;ll take three of those .
not for me ; i &apos;m allergic .
two of those .
come here , kelly .
branch was railroaded .
i really think you guys should reopen the trashman killings .
hold , first of all , why is this so important to you , huh ?
not only is an innocent man in jail ,
understanding the original murders will help us catch
angela o &apos;hara &apos;s killer .
but the murders stopped after branch
was arrested ; how do you explain that ?
the real killer used branch &apos;s arrest
as an opportunity to take a break and cover his tracks .
so then why start killing again now ?
serial killers have poor impulse control .
he couldn &apos;t help himself .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is ,
this guy comes out of retirement ,
kills angela o &apos;hara , and then he changes his m.o.
to throw us off ?
yes !
five @-@ o once asked me to reopen an investigation .
now i &apos;m asking you to do the same .
please .
all right .
i know one of the original detectives
from the trashman case . al shepard .
he &apos;s retired now , but ...
okay , we will go see him ,
and we &apos;ll see what he thinks about your theory , okay ?
thank you .
i was hoping this day would never come .
what do you mean ?
you got to understand the pressure
we were under to make an arrest .
mayor &apos;s office was all over us ,
the press had the island in a panic ,
said we were affecting tourism .
okay , but you did
put branch away for the trashman slayings .
we only had enough evidence
to convict him of one of the murders .
everyone believed that he was the trashman .
my partner believed he was .
but i had my doubts .
okay , why weren &apos;t you able to
tie him to the other murders ?
branch was a drifter , in and out of drug rehab .
the evidence against him was all circumstantial .
oh , so you just got him to confess .
after spending 30 hours in the box with us grilling him ,
he would have copped to the oj murders .
血手套被排除 辛普森在刑事上被判无罪
so , you &apos;re saying you got the wrong guy ?
i &apos;m saying , there &apos;s a lot
to the case that didn &apos;t make sense .
okay , well , we &apos;re here .
we &apos;d like to know what it is that doesn &apos;t make sense .
there was another murder that wasn &apos;t attributed
to the trashman , but i think it was his work .
woman named
jennifer ravich .
she predated the other murders by about five years ,
but just like your victim ,
she wasn &apos;t found in a bag or bound .
she have cracked ribs , too ?
yeah .
and there was evidence that she &apos;d been bound .
but she was older than the other victims ,
so we ruled it out because it didn &apos;t fit the profile .
and you didn &apos;t push it ?
no . branch was in a rehab facility
when jennifer ravich was killed .
would have blown the whole case wide open .
so the prosecuting
attorney &apos;s office just swept it under the rug ?
and i let &apos; em .
okay , so , i pulled jennifer ravich &apos;s case file
from the open unsolved .
murdered in june of 1980 .
her husband was a prime suspect--
there was a history of abuse-- but eventually , he was cleared .
does it look like our guy ?
the injuries are consistent with our other victims .
however , there was blunt force trauma postmortem .
also , there was no ropes , no bags ,
but there were ligature marks .
all right , that does not match our other victims .
well , not necessarily .
if we are indeed looking
at the trashman &apos;s first victim , it &apos;s quite possible
he hadn &apos;t perfected his method yet .
okay , maybe he made a mistake ,
and we can link him to our new victim .
well , perhaps jennifer ravich was close to the killer .
serial killers often choose someone who they &apos;re close to
as their first victim .
all right , well , we have the trashman &apos;s first victim ,
jennifer ravich , and the last one ,
angela o &apos;hara , so what jumps out ?
okay , so , angela was abducted from the north shore ,
and jennifer ravich &apos;s body was found in kailua .
body found on the road ?
no , her body was found on the steps of st. martin &apos;s .
st. martin &apos;s ?
that &apos;s where my mother left me when i was a baby .
your mother , max ?
my biological mother .
as you know , bergman is my adopted name .
oh . that &apos;s good to know .
what does that have to do with the case ?
this is michiyo takeshita .
it &apos;s my biological mother ,
the trashman &apos;s second victim .
how long have you known
that your mother was one of the trashman &apos;s victims ?
a while .
i &apos;ve never talked to anyone about it .
it is , as you can imagine ,
quite difficult for me .
she was an unwed mother
who didn &apos;t know what to do .
did you ever get to meet her ?
no .
i never knew her .
she was already dead when i discovered her name .
that &apos;s why you went to go see richard branch .
yes .
i wanted to meet the man who killed my mother .
but then , i heard his story , and ..
and i looked into the case , and i realized that
he couldn &apos;t have done it .
okay , so , the real question here is ,
what does your mother
have in common with the other victims ?
that i don &apos;t know .
i studied each case over and over again ,
but i failed to come up
with a viable theory as to how he chooses his victims .
there &apos;s got to be something else . there has got to be
a pattern that we are not seeing . what is it ?
okay , so , jennifer ravich was killed
and left on the steps of st. martin &apos;s ,
and you were left there for adoption .
why st. martin &apos;s ?
do you know why she left you there ?
st. martin &apos;s was a well @-@ known safe haven
for unwanted children .
did jennifer ravich have children ?
no . no next of kin listed .
yeah , angela o &apos;hara didn &apos;t have children , either .
hold @-@ hold on a minute .
may @-@ may i see jennifer ravich &apos;s autopsy report ?
autopsy shows evidence of full @-@ term delivery of a child .
what about angela o &apos;hara &apos;s autopsy ?
she also had pelvic separation .
no , no , no .
i was her place . there was no signs of a kid .
no , there wouldn &apos;t be ... if she gave the child up .
i &apos;ll go check it out .
got something ?
yeah .
hey . okay , so , i just spoke to the victim &apos;s mother ,
and i found out that angela had a child out of wedlock ,
and she hid it from her mom .
okay , uh , any connection to st. martin &apos;s ?
yeah , she was a parishioner there .
all right , okay .
uh , so , let &apos;s just assume
she abandons her kid at the church ,
uh , she &apos;s trying to put it behind her .
help me , please .
wait a minute . what about the other victims ?
yeah , i spoke to their family members ,
and i found out that at least three of the victims
had children that they abandoned at st. martin &apos;s .
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s got to be it . that &apos;s his trigger .
he &apos;s targeting women
that abandoned their children at st. martin &apos;s .
either this guy works there , or has a connection .
let &apos;s go .
st. martin &apos;s has always been
a sanctuary for the children of unwed mothers .
okay , uh , how often are babies left here ?
more often than you think .
may i ask what this is about ?
yeah , absolutely . angela o &apos;hara .
we have reason to believe that she left her baby here .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry ,
but we have a very strict privacy policy .
we don &apos;t even keep records .
these women have nowhere else to turn .
the @-@ the women who make the decision
to leave a child with us are under enormous stress .
we understand , but this woman was
abducted and killed .
she ...
i am sorry .
how @-@ how can i help ?
uh , like i said , we need you to tell us
if she left a baby here .
as i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve told you ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
okay , well , maybe you can tell us how it works then ?
someone rings the bell at the side door , and
frank pollard , our caretaker , usually answers .
he &apos;s on the property full @-@ time .
how long has pollard worked here ?
since before i arrived here .
at least 30 years .
you ... you don &apos;t think that ... ?
we need to see him right away .
yes , of course .
sam ?
my assistant sam will take you to him .
could you take these gentlemen to find frank , please ?
of course .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s about those girls , isn &apos;t it ?
just take us to him .
i believe that he &apos;s in his office .
of course it &apos;s in the basement .
yeah . we don &apos;t go down here much .
can &apos;t imagine why not .
it &apos;s this way .
really nice .
hey , frank ?
frank ?
frank ?
what &apos;s up ?
do you see what i see ?
yes . church people are creepy .
those blades .
they &apos;re just like the ones i pulled out
of angela o &apos;hara &apos;s tires .
that &apos;s odd . i @-@ i thought he was down here .
where else would this guy be ?
hey , frank ? !
hey , hands up . five @-@ o. hands up .
step away from the truck and put your hands behind your back now .
now . hands behind your back .
what &apos;s this about ?
hands behind your back !
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of angela o &apos;hara .
they got him .
max ?
did they find anything to tie him to the murders ?
yeah , the razor blades in his office match the ones
we pulled out of angela o &apos;hara &apos;s tires .
fong &apos;s processing the truck , too .
max , are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine .
let &apos;s do this again .
jennifer ravich , sarah cho ,
michiyo takeshita , marcia long ,
rachel wilkinson ,
diane gallo and angela o &apos;hara .
all victims of the trashman .
that your thing , isn &apos;t it , frank ?
killing women who leave their children at the church .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
we got the ropes ,
we got the razorblades , frank .
why would i kill those women ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe &apos; cause
you were the one found the children .
i want you to look at this .
this is angela o &apos;hara .
okay ? you abducted and killed this woman last night ,
and you dumped her body in a pineapple field .
that &apos;s impossible ! i already told you .
i was visiting my mother in the hospital .
that &apos;s the wrong answer , frank .
we already found her blood in your truck .
that &apos;s not my truck . it &apos;s the church &apos;s .
his alibi checks out .
what the hell is going on ?
he was at the hospital while his mother
was having dialysis
when angela o &apos;hara was abducted .
who else has access to that truck ?
sam . he keeps the keys in his office .
he &apos;s deacon mackenna &apos;s assistant .
guys , get over to that church right away .
they already arrested frank pollard .
i am aware of that .
was it true that he &apos;s the trashman ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
is there , is there some kind of problem , though ?
no .
uh , not at all .
i , i just need to see something for myself .
here it is .
did pollard have arthritis ?
yes , he did .

the intricate knots would be impossible with arthritis .
mr. sherman ?
mr. sherman ?
why did you come back ?
it &apos;s you .
you &apos;re the trashman .
why did you kill all those women ?
you of all people should know , max .
they threw us away ,
left us on some doorstep like a piece of trash .
jennifer ravich--
your first victim ...
she was your mother , wasn &apos;t she ?
she wasn &apos;t my mother .
i grew up without one .
i was passed along from one horrible and abusive
foster home to another ,
like they were doing me a big favor .
you know how that feels , max , don &apos;t you ?
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
i know more than you think .
i was here the day that you were dropped off by your mother ,
your real mother .
such a pretty girl .
she was scared , she had no other choice .
they all say that .
they want to get on with their lives ,
they want to pretend it never happened ,
throw us away so they can get on with their lives .
you didn &apos;t know her !
did you know she came back ?
you &apos;re lying .
oh , no , max , she came back years
after she abandoned you .
wanted to know what happened to you , where you were .
said she had her life together .
she wanted to find you , max !
she did ?
and that &apos;s how i found her .
she shouldn &apos;t have come back ...
just like you shouldn &apos;t have come back .
that &apos;s max &apos;s car .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
she didn &apos;t want you , max .
don &apos;t you understand that ?
you &apos;re just like me .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m normal .
you are mentally ill .
you find max ?
no .
no sign of the deacon or sam either .
basement .
normal ?
you cut up dead bodies for a living .
you &apos;re just like me !
who knows you &apos;re here ?
nobody .
max , are you okay ? max ? max ?
max .
they &apos;re coming .
you okay , max ?
you didn &apos;t talk to him , did you ?
no , he &apos;s , he &apos;s not taking my calls .
you worried ?
a bit , like a cheerleader &apos;s father
on prom night .
well , wherever mcgarrett &apos;s going ,
obviously he &apos;s got to do it himself .
otherwise he would have asked us for help . right ?
he &apos;s probably just trying to protect us ,
make sure we don &apos;t get hurt , you know .
hope you guys are hungry .
all right ... this is on the house , right ?
i wish , brah , but times are tight .
i got to save up for a new truck .
you sure about that ?
yeah .
the truck is back .
you know what ? lunch is on the house .
all right , case of the missing shrimp truck
is officially closed , thank god .
no , no , no , i want to press charges .
ha , good luck with that .
what , who took it ?
city of honolulu .
why would they do that ?
you forgot to pay your vendor license , big guy .
okay , now cough it up .
you owe me 200 bucks for towing and impound charges .
i &apos;ll put it on your tab , sistah .
