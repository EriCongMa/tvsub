he bashed that poor girl &apos;s brains in .
i hear you . i know .
it was a tragedy . the fact is though ...

ralphie &apos;s a made guy . all things considered , he has a legitimate beef .

of course . rules are rules , otherwise what ? fucking anarchy .
he owes you an apology .
with the money i put in his pocket , the prick should hit his knees .

no offense .
i could see if it was his daughter or a niece .
but all this over some dead whore .
he had to be fucking her .
no . he knew you were .
that &apos;s why , that &apos;s how he is . like a dog with two bones .
i &apos;m supposed to go to tony &apos;s for thanksgiving . me and ro .

i &apos;m trying to quit smoking .
serial killer .
i murdered seven relationships .
hey , why don &apos;t you take my appointment ?

how hard was that ?
hello ?
ro , it &apos;s carm .

it &apos;s my dad .
they had some troubling test results .
oh , my god .
yeah , i know .
they have to do further testing .
ma wants a quiet thanksgiving . just the two of them , but ...
they should be with family .
i feel awful giving so little notice .
i wish i could do something .
that is so sweet . i &apos;ll let you know when i know anything .
okay . take care , sweetheart . bye .
all right . bye @-@ bye .
carm &apos;s father , he &apos;s sick . she had to cancel thanksgiving .
it &apos;s 3 a.m. and bam ! come wide awake .
something specific ?
it &apos;s a management problem . a situation with an underling .
now it &apos;s partly my fault . but he never should have done what he did .
what was it ? could you tell me that ?
caused the ...
... early retirement ...
... of somebody else .
particulars aren &apos;t important . he fucked up .
now , ordinarily i would , you know , put him out to pasture .
but he &apos;s a very valuable piece of manpower .
is it complicated by a personal relationship ?
been reading that book you told me about .
the art of war by sun tzu .
here &apos;s this guy , a chinese general , wrote this thing 2400 years ago .
and most of it still applies today .
balk the enemy &apos;s power . force him to reveal himself .
i have to ask . are you in any sort of danger ?
no , no . can i go on ?
most of the guys i know read prince , machiavelli .
and i had carmela go and get the cliff notes once . it was okay .
but this book is much better about strategy .
i wanted to ask you about the girl that was here today .
the mercedes saleslady .
i &apos;m sorry about the confusion .
what does she need a shrink for ?
i can &apos;t talk about another patient .
just ... it makes you wonder , that &apos;s all .
listen , it &apos;s after @-@ hours . it &apos;s dark .
you want me to walk you to your car ?
no , thank you .
i have some work i have to catch up on here .
anyone for a turtle ?
aaron . honey ?

my two boys .
i was worried about the gravy , but ...

they &apos;re the same .
what &apos;s he saying about me ?
to me ? nothing . he knows better .
he &apos;s still breaking my balls though about taking orders from me .
it &apos;s your job to make my job easier .
i &apos;m not complaining . you asked me . he &apos;s a frustrating guy .
i don &apos;t know how things are gonna go .
he might not go away .
it &apos;s not just him . this freon deal . we &apos;re renovating at the house .
i got two kids going to college .
hey , hang in there . you &apos;re doing a good job .
did you see those bags ? fucking stress is killing him .

no , thank you .
johnny , please , don &apos;t get up .

ever since i &apos;m back from miami , he &apos;s up my ass .
i &apos;m earning with three hands here and he &apos;s still not satisfied .
and then he fucking hits me ?
he &apos;s not leaving me a lot of options .
don &apos;t talk crazy .
you wanna commit suicide , pills are a lot easier .
what would carmine say if i wanted to switch families , come with you guys ?
carmine doesn &apos;t know who you are .
you could tell him .
ralph , listen to me . as a friend , i know tony can be difficult .
his father was the same . they need someone to demonize .
new york and sopranos have long @-@ standing ties . that won &apos;t change .
not for you or anybody else .
you want me to be frank ?
you brought it on you with that girl .
a : she was a whore .
b : she hit me .
and that wasn &apos;t my kid she was carrying .
it was the fucking coke .
i should have never started with that shit .
fucking miami , it &apos;s all over the place .
tell anthony you &apos;re sorry .
i was high , i admit it .
and i &apos;m not doing it anymore .
&quot; tony , i &apos;m sorry ... &quot;
what good would it do ?
it might save your life !
he hit me .
he was wrong . believe me , he knows .
people are laughing behind my back .
talk to tony . he &apos;ll make it right .
at this point , how ?
i don &apos;t know .
would you take capo of your crew ?
no . no , i wouldn &apos;t . no fucking way .
ralph cifaretto came by .
what &apos;d he want ?
a fully fueled jet and a safe trip to the pope ?
he &apos;s scared since you canceled dinner .
if your opponent is of choleric temper , irritate him .
yeah , well , he wants to apologize .
oh , really ?
would that put this to rest ?
if it &apos;s sincere , it might relieve me of an unpleasant decision .
they &apos;re about to break ground on the esplanade .
we &apos;re talking about millions .
be nice to have a man in there who feels appreciated .
it wouldn &apos;t hurt to throw him a bone .
like what ?
capo .
no fucking way . never .
you heard what he did . that poor girl just turned 20 .
capo &apos;s what he mentioned . i threw cold water on it right away .
but she was a whore , tony .
i don &apos;t want to talk about that ever again . you understand me ?
it was just a suggestion . keep a happy shop .
you weren &apos;t gonna stick your beak in .
can &apos;t two friends talk ?
i talked to him . he &apos;s delighted you wanna see him .
great . he said that ? that &apos;s great . that &apos;s fucking great news .
what &apos;d i tell you ?

he indicated he &apos;s open to working something out .
thank you . thank you . anything . thank you , thank you .

i &apos;m trying to do you a favor .
and that bullshit your future father @-@ in @-@ law pulled on thanksgiving ?
he knew i had no intention of going . he &apos;s trying to save face .
he stooped so low , he had his wife lie to your mother .
whatever you need , give me a call . be good .
the woman is 50 years old . sometimes i just wanna scream in her face :
sometimes i just wanna scream in her face :
&quot; quit whining ! no wonder he left you ! &quot;
her supervisor looks at her cross @-@ eyed and i get a call at 3 a.m.
she wants to talk about how her father used to laugh at her when she was 7 .
did she call your emergency number ?
that &apos;s not the point , elliot !
oh , these fucking interruptions .
i was raped .
you have feelings , and who listens ?
that &apos;s right , damn it .
i have to sit there and take care of these people hour after hour .
with all their problems . and some of them are very real .
and very serious . and i &apos;m sorry . i care ,
i really do .
but it &apos;s hard sometimes . i just wanna say , &quot; i hurt . &quot;
good . sure . that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m sorry , elliot .
no need to be sorry .
you &apos;ve been through such trauma .
it takes tremendous strength of will and inner resource ...
... to soldier on as you do at work .
thank you , elliot .
i try . i really do .
it &apos;s just hard sometimes
and patient soprano ? how &apos;s all that ?
he offered to escort me to my car .
i almost fell in his arms crying .
oh , jesus christ .
paulie .
ralphie .
you wanted to see me ?
yeah , tony .
about what ?
about what ? you know ...
... to apologize .
sit down ?
i was doing a lot of coke .
i said some things and i did some things ...
... that i &apos;m sorry for .
it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
what &apos;d you do ?
i was rude ...
... when you offered me the drink .
and i disrespected the bing .
and the girl .
that shouldn &apos;t have happened . like i said , i was doing a lot of coke .
i gave that up .
and end of story .
and i &apos;m sorry , tony . okay ?

after decades of planning , ground was broken ...
... on newark &apos;s museum of science and trucking and riverfront esplanade .
oh , hi , ralphie . come on in . he &apos;s watching tv .
the project was held up by political infighting .
nothing . he gave me nothing .
look , the fucking esplanade . we &apos;ll need bulldozers for the money .
not a thank you , not an apology . nothing !
calm down , take it easy .
he let me stand there like ...
... a servant . scraping . bowing .
didn &apos;t even ask me to sit down .
it &apos;s part of the game .
he &apos;s going down .
are you fucking stupid ?
i don &apos;t give a fuck any more .
i &apos;ve given my life to this thing . and this is the thanks i get ?
it &apos;s silvio dante on the phone .
tell him i &apos;ll call him back .
they &apos;re my children , thorne .
you seriously cannot be ...
i &apos;m so sorry !
you shut the door ?
jesus , you &apos;re worse than bobby .

real contretemps you have on your hands here .
you shouldn &apos;t have put gigi in there .
strong , good earner , well @-@ respected .
not by that crew . to them he &apos;s a ghibelline coming over to butt in .
they don &apos;t trust him .
plus , you got ralph now pissing in their ears .
any day , you &apos;ll have a mutiny on your hands .
so i take gigi out . what kind of message is that ?
that you &apos;re unsure of yourself .
exactly .
who do i replace him with ?
good question .
great . what &apos;s the fucking answer ?
who says there is one ?
that &apos;s what being a boss is . steer the ship the best you can .
sometimes it &apos;s smooth , sometimes rocky . in the meantime ...
... you find your pleasures where you can .
how much longer , skip ? i gotta take a leak .
holy jesus !
what the fuck you looking at ? call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
