第一季 第三集
you &apos;ll never believe what &apos;s on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
someone saw serena getting off a train at grand central .
serena ?
serena &apos;s at school .
why &apos;d she return ?
let me guess-- you told everyone
eric &apos;s just visiting grandpa in rhode island .
your aunt carol in miami .
he tries to take his own life ,
and you &apos;re worried it &apos;s gonna cost you mom of the year ?
must be a lot of rumors why you &apos;re back .
none of them mention you .
nate &apos;s gonna wait for serena .
he can get in line behind that guy .
i don &apos;t need some new boy influencing her ,
distracting her from her needs .
a kid like dan is exactly what serena needs .
guess who &apos;s dad is cool ?
it &apos;s a trick question. yeah , cause it can &apos;t be ours .
you &apos;re going out with serena ,
and i &apos;m going to kiss on the lips .
who said this family wasn &apos;t cool ?
i thought everything was good between us .
it was ...
before i found out you had sex with my boyfriend .
great , just in time for brunch .
i told her to stay away .
i &apos;m not sneaking around with you. just to talk .
you said you &apos;d never speak to her again .
so you slept with your best friend &apos;s boyfriend .
is that true ?
then she ran away
and lied about it .
poor daniel--so little time , so many sluts to defend .
this world , it &apos;s--it &apos;s crazy .
and you &apos;re a part of it .
blair , how can i fix this ?
you don &apos;t , .
serena
you just stay away .
but now that serena is back ,
will the upper east side ever be the same ?
it takes two tangle ,
and girls like these don &apos;t go down without a fight .
there &apos;s plenty of upside
to being the spawn of the fabulously wealthy .
but the downside ?
super successful parents
except nothing less from their offspring .
and when it comes to college , that means the ivies .
it &apos;s more than just getting into college .
it &apos;s setting a course for the rest of your life .
and for those few who aren &apos;t legacies ,
the pressures are no less .
when parents have sacrificed for their children &apos;s futures ,
what kid would wanna let them down ?
thank you , ladies .
good morning , students .
i ask all of you to show a little sympathy for our junior class .
they are almost through with ivy week .
as is our long @-@ standing tradition ,
the constance billard girls
will be in charge of friday night &apos;s mixer ,
and the st. jude &apos;s boys
will provide the ushers for the visiting representatives .
for those of you who dream of attending an ivy league school ,
this mixer is the most important event of your life .
but no pressure .
ah , it &apos;s not that bad .
it looks like i shaved with a wood chipper .
i was going with more of a chain saw .
not helping .
not trying to. hey ,
look on the bright side-- you &apos;re not a hemophiliac .
otherwise , you &apos;d-- you &apos;d be in the emergency room .
and that &apos;s helping ?
mm , not really .
dartmouth &apos;s gonna love you .
yeah , i gotta believe being able to shave is a prerequisite for attending .
no one is better qualified ,
no one is smarter , more well @-@ rounded ... or wounded ?
i have a trust fund to fall back on , dad .
you know , all i have is what &apos;s up here. oh .
well , that is the most important thing .
college is about academic excellence ,
not your stock portfolio .
besides , you &apos;re gonna do great in your interview .
you take after your dad that way .
spotlight doesn &apos;t phase us .
ooh , you better hope there &apos;s not a spotlight involved .
i &apos;m your sister. it &apos;s what i do .
not when it &apos;s about dartmouth .
remember , students ... nathaniel , a little wake and ke
we have our interviews today .
my point exactly .
i have my 1 @-@ hitter .
... but under classmen should consider this week a dress rehearsal .
you are not only representing yourselves this week ,
but generations from our school and your families .
try not to cut me off next time .
you almost knocked me over the side of the bench .
i didn &apos;t cut you off .
i didn &apos;t mean to. you win fair and square ,
and nothing could make me prouder ...
till you get in the old alma mater , that is .
dad , we talked about this ,
about me keeping my options open , looking out west. yeah , of course ,
but let &apos;s get serious here .
someone with your grades wants to get into dartmouth ,
you need to appear to be working for it. da i--
ushering the rep is a good step .
how come every time i bring up going to u.s.c ,
you act like it &apos;s a joke ? nate , there &apos;s a plan here .
maybe i want to make my own plan .
listen , your mother and i didn &apos;t work this hard
so you can just make things up as you go along .
dartmouth , law school , blair .
soon you &apos;re gonna have everything .
listen , i &apos;m late for work. nail that interview today .
go , green !
as part of ivy week &apos;s festivities ,
at tomorrow night &apos;s mixer ,
blair waldorf will annoucharity
her community outreach committee will honor this year .
have you seen serena ? i wonder where she is .
and you know what i wonder ?
how i &apos;m supposed to hear anything about yale
with all this talk about serena .
do you remember when dad gave me my first yale sweatshirt ?
i don &apos;t think any piece of clothing
has ever fit me more perfectly ,
not to mention how adorable i found that bulldog .
remember when i asked you if i could get a bulldog ?
good call , by the way , saying no .
and now the big day is finally here .
soon nate and i will be away at college .
him coming down to yale , me going up to dartmouth .
dad flying in for the princeton game .
i hope it doesn &apos;t make you
feel old watching me grow up .
eat up , miss blair .
your mom would want you to have a good breakfast .
and now headmaster prescott ...
so serena &apos;s really not here ?
that &apos;s what i said .
when you weren &apos;t supposed to be talking .
serena , come on. hurry up .
you &apos;re gonna be late .
i am ! and i know .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t have stayed at your brother &apos;s again .
i mean , why sleep there ?
it &apos;s not like he can even see you .
his eyes are closed .
do you have one maternal bone in your entire body ?
u se , yoneed your rest , okay ?
it &apos;s ivy week .
i know , and if i can get out of this hotel room ,
it &apos;s my sole mission in life to impress that brown rep .
well , i am so thrilled to hear you say that &apos;s still your plan ,
because , i mean , i know it &apos;s something we &apos;ve always talked about ,
but honestly , since you &apos;ve been back ,
i &apos;ve , uh , wondered if your mind was even on college .
look , mom , i &apos;ve had my mind on a lot of things .
but since recent events ,
going away to college sounds pretty good .
how , um , how did you leave things with dan ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what &apos;s going on with you and blair ? mom , please !
it &apos;s o-- look , all i wanna do
is just finish high school in peace
and go away to a state
with lots of people who don &apos;t know who i am
and just start over , okay ?
take a cab. don &apos;t walk .
oh , god .
god , please don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s over .
what ? you were there .
i @-@ i would say it &apos;s pretty over .
i meant the assembly .
oh , right. no , yeah , no , it just ended now .
damn it .
anyway , good luck .
yeah , you , too .
oh , too bad you missed the assembly
not that it matters .
brown doesn &apos;t offer degrees in slut .
spotted-- s. not so fashionably late
and dressed down by b .
game on , ladies .
look , i made a mistake with nate , okay ?
but then you sabotaged me with dan .
we don &apos;t have to be friends , but--oh !
ugh ! what &apos;s up , waldorf ?
sorry. it slipped .
i &apos;m fine .
i really want to believe that was an accident .
then you must be delusional .
thank you .
running out of colors here , blair .
and i &apos;m running out of patience. enough , okay ?
it &apos;s enough when i say it &apos;s enough .
god !
girls , break it up !
get off of me !
is that enough yet ? !
so we &apos;ve actually come to physical blows , huh ?
truce ?
ow ! my leg !
serena , you &apos;re out of here
i hope it &apos;s broken .
hey , upper east siders .
we hear that world war iii just broke out ,
and it &apos;s wearing kneesocks .
choose your side or run and hide .
we have a feeling this one &apos;s to the death .
why should you be the dartmouth usher ?
well , i &apos;ve given this a lot of thought ,
and i think i can answer your question in three parts .
and i &apos;d like to start with the third part first ,
if it &apos;s cool , unless , uh , that would be confusing .
in which case , i can start at the beginning .
um , the dartmouth &quot; principles of community &quot;
highlight integrity ,
responsibility and consideration .
uh , well , from st. jude &apos;s , i &apos;ve learned integrity .
from being an older brother , i have learned responsibility ,
and from my parents ,
who have sacrificed everything to send me to this school ,
i &apos;ve learned consideration .
it really comes down to one thing
dartmouth is my dream ,
and i &apos;ve never asked dartmouth , but ...
i think it &apos;s been dreaming of me .
that--that was a joke ,
or an attempt at one .
next question .
you are the ideal dartmouth candidate .
thank you , sir .
and it would be an honor to attend dartmouth .
i &apos;ve grown up hearing all about it from my father .
i &apos;m just not sure it &apos;s my first choice ,
and if there &apos;s only one usher position available ,
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s someone who wants it more than me .
why should i be chosen to be an usher ?
i &apos;m chuck bass .
excuse me .
yale chuck nass , dartmouth nate
you get the one you wanted ?
no. no , actually , you did ...
which makes total sense because i &apos;m second in our class ,
and you &apos;re somewhere around--
what , i don &apos;t know , uh , last ?
no hard feelings , huh ?
why should there be ?
i mean , how many libraries has your dad had to endow to get you this spot ?
you &apos;ve earned it .
look , man , you don &apos;t know anything about my family .
i &apos;m sorry. you &apos;re right. you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sure j.l. hall will be very impressed
with your passion for the dartmouth experience .
who the hell is j.l. hall ?
he &apos;s the ivy rep .
you might want to pick up his book
if you want anything to talk about .
&quot; the petting zoo &quot; --
that &apos;s the name of his book .
whoa. angry guy , huh ?
short fuse . i &apos;m trying to work on that .
well , let me know how that goes for you .
yeah , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll keep you posted .
it &apos;s a tough week .
not for me , apparently .
oh , you got an usher position ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
uh , in an ironic though not totally unexpected twist ,
nate got the one i wanted .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , well , i guess that &apos;s life when you &apos;re not a legacy .
well , hey , just &apos; cause you &apos;re not an usher
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re not gonna get into an ivy .
yeah ? wh--uh , where &apos;d your parents go to school ?
harvard and brown .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
i can &apos;t believe serena did this. yeah , such a cheap shot .
finally .
hello to you , too . i heard about the field hockey throw down .
all those mouth guards and short skirts
i hope somebody filmed it .
you &apos;re heinous. which is probably why you called .
you know me well .
women like to pretend they &apos;re complicated . i know better .
my leg &apos;s numb now .
how about a heating pad ?
sure. okay .
serena came home for a reason .
one can only guess . i &apos;m done guessing .
i want answers ,
and no one likes to be on the ground floor of a scandal like chuck bass .
i am a bitch when i wanna be .
opportunity to cause some trouble , uncover a secret ?
take &quot; yes &quot; for an answer .
let &apos;s turn back to school .
i left something important behind .
oh , danny boy , how was your day ?
he &apos;s about to hype dinner .
bcause no matter how good it was ,
it &apos;s about to get a lot better .
i &apos;ve outdone myself with the bolognese .
sorry about the melodramatic entrance .
you didn &apos;t get it ?
no , i didn &apos;t get it .
and that i do not get .
they gave it to nate ...
archibald !
last year , uh , i believe he had an original thought .
it died of loneliness .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ?
yeah , i know how much you and mom sacrificed .
the whole reason you send us to a school like this
is so we can go to a college of our choice .
what if that &apos;s all for nothing ?
it &apos;s not , okay ?
it &apos;s not .
so you don &apos;t get to be the usher of some whatever party .
dad , can i just , um , stew alone for awhile ?
we &apos;re humphreys , dad .
not exactly royalty uptown .
are you okay with that ?
no ,
but i &apos;m used to it .
ostroff center .
this is way too good .
mom , how &apos;s paris ?
you &apos;re not going to believe
where i found our little princess .
really ?
admit it.even for me , this was good .
if you weren &apos;t such a perv ,
i &apos;m sure the c.i.a. would hire you in a second .
defending my country--there &apos;s a future i never imagined .
with good reason. what is she doing there ?
well , what &apos;s anyone doing there ?
it &apos;s a facility for the disturbed or addicted .
you must have your own wing .
you don &apos;t get nearly enough credit for your wit .
so the question is , what do you do now ?
well , i was thinking ...
total social destruction .
and here i thought you were getting soft .
so this is your bed , huh ?
leaving now .
you can repay me another time .
i &apos;ve been in these sessions every day for the last week ,
but nothing is going to change unless she stops hiding him here
and lets him have his life back .
this is not called hiding , serena .
it &apos;s called recovery .
telling everyone he &apos;s staying with aunt carol in miami ?
he &apos;s not ready .
he &apos;s not , or you &apos;re not ?
okay , let &apos;s take a deep breath .
it &apos;s good to see honest conversation .
what does she know about honesty ? serena .
but i really think a decision like this includes eric as well .
oh , you mean i have a say in this ? wow. thanks .
eric , of course. we &apos;re here for you .
look , if you &apos;re ready to leave , you tell us , okay ?
no matter what mom says .
i would really like to get out of here ...
but maybe i &apos;m not ready yet .
hey , what about for a few hours ?
you can be my date to the ivy week party tonight .
serena , that party is an important event for you .
well , he &apos;ll be around people he knows .
it &apos;ll be fun , comfortable .
uh , actually , that sounds great .
well , there we go .
compromise. that wasn &apos;t so hard , was it ?
you know what ? i have to go ,
help them set up for tonight at the school .
it &apos;s my job as both parent committee chair and responsible mother .
it &apos;ll be great , okay ?
hi. how are you ? good .
rufus humphrey. mm @-@ hmm .
uh , my kid , dan , goes to st. jude &apos;s ,
and he really should have been selected as dartmouth &apos;s usher .
maybe there was a mix @-@ up , some kind of a glitch in the system ?
i &apos;d like to believe that because i like to believe the best in people .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. humphrey .
the usher positions have been filled .
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
uh , is there anything else ? any other positions ?
uh , you &apos;ll have to discuss this with our committee chairwoman .
sure , perfect . i &apos;d love to. where can i find her ?
i &apos;m not sure. she must be running late. i ...
oh , there she is now .
why am i not surprised ?
lucky for you , she seems to be in a good mood .
until she sees me .
rufus .
told ya. excuse me .
you got a minute , lil ? not for you .
you &apos;re in .
what ? the ivy week party tonight .
your name will be on the program and everything .
you got me the dartmouth spot ?
i knew you could do it , dad .
no , you didn &apos;t , and no , i didn &apos;t .
how do you feel about the refreshment committee ?
well , there is there is no refreshment committee
not until now. oh , god .
what ? everybody gets thirsty .
it &apos;s really a position of power .
how did you secure me this prominent
and simultaneously embarrassing position ?
by offering my own services
serving snacks ?
i &apos;m the head of the entertainment committee .
a @-@ another committee that didn &apos;t exist
until you left the house today .
way to go , dad .
wait. so who &apos;s the entertainment ?
uh , since it was such short notice ,
the only person i could get was myself .
kind of a staid affair
for early &apos; 90s postpunk math rock ,
don &apos;t you think ?
i &apos;m bringing a couple of the guys .
it &apos;ll be rufus unplugged .
need a roadie ?
thanks , sweetie
and we can just call mom
make this a
full @-@ fledged humphrey affair ?
look , i did the best i could .
at least you get to officially be a part of this thing .
you can talk to that author you love ,
ask him anything you want .
like his , uh , preference for soft drinks ?
if you get at all anxious , sweetie ,
if you feel light @-@ headed or panicky--
i &apos;ll be fine , mom .
all i have to do is be normal .
or at least act normal .
works for mom .
do you see the yale rep ?
i thought you wanted to go to brown ,
and blair wanted to go to yale .
yeah , i know .
my father would never forgive me
if i didn &apos;t introduce myself .
he says that you two used to do crew together .
crew ?
oh , hi . i &apos;m serena van der woodsen .
blair , i didn &apos;t know you were interested in doing crew .
i &apos;m not . i was just saying that there &apos;s a family connection
because of my father-- in fact , i didn &apos;t know
you were interested in athletics at all .
well , especially ones where you might get your hair wet .
she &apos;s really more of the indoors type of girl .
oh , my goodness. your glass is almost empty .
let &apos;s get you a drink .
uh , no , i &apos;ll take him .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
so tell me about yale .
can you please explain
how serena &apos;s commandeering the yale rep
while you &apos;re supposed to be his usher ?
i switched .
i &apos;m trying to get into princeton .
oh , don &apos;t your la perlas in a bunch .
look who &apos;s arrived-- dr. ostroff .
blair , dr. donald ostroff .
interesting choice of guest , b .
such a pleasure . i &apos;ve heard s @-@ such wonderful things ...
coincidence ? i think not .
i liked your book .
oh , thanks. what did you think of the epilogue ?
some people really love it .
&quot; the new york times &quot; called it a &quot; cheap cop @-@ out . &quot;
warner bros. is making a movie .
i think they &apos;re gonna change the end .
well , i can see how the ending
might not seem all that ... commercial .
would you like something to drink ?
lily , how are you ?
oh , bart , hello. how are you ?
hey , eric .
how &apos;s , uh , miami ?
it was good , thanks .
you know , go , marlins .
would you excuse me , please ?
so the neuroscience project i &apos;m working on
involves the cellular signaling pathway
of neuronal nitric oxide synthase .
it &apos;s initiated when glutamate binds to n.m.d.a.r ...
hi. you &apos;re eric , right ?
yeah , you &apos;re jenny , dan &apos;s sister , right ?
yeah , we , um , met at ...
bendel &apos;s. yeah , i remember. oh , cool .
eric , good to see you .
you enjoy miami ?
uh , yeah. s @-@ save the manatees .
manatees ?
it &apos;s a long story . i &apos;ve got time .
it &apos;s a little dark and ...
i can handle it .
you wanna go to yale then ?
no , brown .
it &apos;s just this thing with blair .
oh , yeah. yeah , i get it .
i mean , since you don &apos;t have to actually worry about getting into college ,
why not make the entire evening about screwing over blair ?
no , thanks .
wait , you &apos;re seriously not gonna talk to me ?
like , literally not speak ?
oh , much better .
thanks , guys .
so , um , what &apos;s he like ?
like a dartmouth english lit professor
i have nothing in common with .
guess i could tell him
how everything i have i got
because i &apos;m an archibald .
you should mention dr. seuss .
theodor geisel is his real name. he went to dartmouth .
uh , hall said he got the idea for &quot; the petting zoo &quot;
from &quot; the lorax . &quot;
what ?
um , you know what ? never mind .
just--just mention how his prose style
is influenced by early faulkner .
you &apos;ll be all right .
uh , or not .
i was actually gonna get some fresh air .
how about you take these over to him ?
all right .
yeah , i guess i could leave my post unmanned for a minute or two .
where do you think you &apos;re going ? home .
i don &apos;t think so .
now you get back out there and you finish what you started .
you mean what you started ? i don &apos;t wanna go to dartmouth .
there , i said it. now back off .
so we moved into the hotel , and , uh ...
it was just the two of us ,
and i was really lonely .
so ... that &apos;s when you ...
so i ended up at the ostroff center .
and my mom says that they have the best counselors ,
but what they really get paid for
is to to keep their mouths shut .
look , i @-@ i won &apos;t say anything .
i promise .
so do you wanna go back in ?
yeah , and answer more questions about florida ?
well , i have a grandma who lives in fort myers .
i can help think of some material .
may i please have everyone &apos;s attention ?
welcome again
to the constance billard / st. jude &apos;s ivy week mixer .
i &apos;m blair blorf ,
chair of the community outreach committee .
every year , our schools choose to support
one local institution that we feel benefits our community .
this year ,
our schools have chosen to honor
the ostroff center .
this semester , our choice is a very personal one
because the center has helped one of our own .
what is going on here ?
it &apos;s because of their excellent program
which aids so many young addicts and alcoholics
that a student here with us today is clean and sober .
at least , for now .
can i please have serena van der woodsen join me onstage ?
spotted at ivy week mixer
s. and b . &apos; s last stand ,
and only one gets out alive .
better take cover .
please tell me this isn &apos;t happening .
it &apos;s not .
no. no , you &apos;re not going there .
you &apos;re gonna stay right here , okay ?
whatever you &apos;re doing ,
think about who &apos;s standing in this room right now .
don &apos;t try to deny it. chuck saw you .
hi . i &apos;m serena van der woodsen .
i just wanna thank my friend , blair waldorf ,
for recognizing the ostroff center
and all of the good things that they do .
thanks , blair .
at the center ,
one of the main things that we learn is forgiveness .
she &apos;s in rehab ? no , it &apos;s not her. it &apos;s her brother who &apos;s there .
what ? you can &apos;t tell anyone , okay ?
i won &apos;t , but why is she doing this ?
i &apos;ve learned about how ,
in order to move forward with our future ,
we must forgive those who have wronged us in the past ,
and we must , ourselves , ask for forgiveness
from those whom we &apos;ve wronged .
without this forgiveness ,
innocent people get hurt--
all right , thank you , serena. thank you. thank you .
honesty may be the best policy in some zip codes ,
but not in this one ,
and not this week ,
because &quot; i was a teenage drug addict &quot;
is not exactly a winning college essay .
and now can i please have dr. ostroff join me onstage ?
why is blair outing you
for a drug problem that you don &apos;t have ?
you don &apos;t , do you ? mom !
ot lll , we &apos;s nike have some free , open relationship .
and that &apos;s my fault ?
look , what &apos;s happened to eric
has put a huge strain on our family ,
but we are still a family .
why do you think i did what i just did ?
will you excuse me ?
i &apos;m gonna go end this with blair now .
blair , what the hell was that ?
will you excuse us , please ?
sure .
so we good now ?
are we square ?
no , because nothing i do
will ever be as bad as what you did to me .
look , i &apos;m asking you , please .
i &apos;ll stop if you will .
you &apos;re just saying that because today you lost ,
and you &apos;re gonna keep losing .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , unlike you ,
i have a future to get back to .
serena .
serena ! what ? what , do you want to congratulate me
on destroying my future ? no , no , no , no , no , no .
i just wanted to ask if you &apos;re okay ,
because what you did in there for your brother ,
that was ... that was very cool .
wait , how did you know about my brother ? it--it &apos;s okay .
really , no one will ever hear it from me ,
but if you ever need anybody to talk to ,
or not talk to ,
i &apos;d be happy to do either .
i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
and , um ,
i know i said some things about you
and your world ,
i &apos;am sorry .
obviously , i don &apos;t know anything about your life .
thank you ,
but i &apos;ve really got to get out of here .
yeah , sure , sure .
but ...
maybe , you know , i can take you up on
that getting together and not talking thing sometime ?
will you call me ?
yeah .
okay , let &apos;s go. let &apos;s get out of here .
no , there &apos;s someone i need to talk to first .
please , mom , i can do this .
okay .
blair , can i talk to you ? .
it &apos;ll just take a moment
sure. sure .
serena &apos;s not a patient at the ostroff center .
eric , you &apos;ve always been a sweet kid ,
and i can understand you
trying to protect your sister-- i am .
i &apos;ve never even seen you take a drink .
i &apos;m not an alcoholic .
i did this .
and today , serena protected me .
eric , i ...
i didn &apos;t ...
see that coming ? yeah .
oh , it must be a shock for someone who thinks she knows everything .
and what was that all about ?
another bomb lands in blair &apos;s lap .
will she use it as ammunition ,
or will she finally surrender and put down her arms ?
nothing .
so you really impressed the guy , huh ?
must be the way you poured those sodas .
yeah , about that , uh ...
i know i may have been a little light on the gratitude ...
yeah , a touch .
but i appreciate it , all of it ,
even if i sometimes don &apos;t show it .
we &apos;re real men , son .
we don &apos;t like to share our feelings .
but ...
i know what you &apos;re capable of ,
and nothing--
my last name ,
my bank account--
is gonna keep you from getting what you deserve ,
not if i can help it .
and i see that dartmouth
has an electroacoustic music program .
what do you think of me applying ? what ?
yeah , and jenny &apos;s smart. we &apos;ll get her early admission .
maybe we &apos;ll all go .
so not remotely funny .
nate .
hello ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
where the hell could you possibly have to be right now ?
i &apos;m late for a run with my dad .
who &apos;s jessica ?
aw , jersey girls .
let &apos;s just say
they &apos;re the princeton tigers for a reason .
all right , i &apos;ll see ya .
hey , good to see you , son .
turns out jed &apos;s a runner , too .
i would if i knew he was gonna get me out here this early .
you &apos;re feeling better , nate .
i was , uh , just telling jed
about your little bout of food poisoning last night .
what do you say , kiddo ?
you want to show him how it &apos;s done ? let &apos;s go .
nate is the captain of his lacrosse team ,
as well as being an all @-@ star cross @-@ country runner .
um , is it okay that i &apos;m here ?
yeah. hi .
uh , will your mom be mad ?
that you &apos;re here ? that would require her stopping by .
saturday mornings are spent at bliss ,
and after last night ,
i think she could use some extra time on the massage table .
right. well , here .
somebody has an admirer .
they &apos;re for my sister ... from the brown rep .
um , apparently his cousin did some time here in his youth .
well , that &apos;s good , right ?
i mean , at least her entire future isn &apos;t blown .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s making her feel a whole lot better right now .
whenever something &apos;s bothering you ,
i can always find you here .
you here for another catfight ?
what &apos;s that ?
a letter .
i wrote it to you when you were away at boarding school .
i never sent it .
dear serena ,
my world is falling apart ,
and you &apos;re the only one who would understand .
my father left my mother for a 31 @-@ year @-@ old model ...
a male model .
i feel like screaming
because i don &apos;t have anyone to talk to .
you &apos;re gone ...
my dad &apos;s gone .
nate &apos;s acting weird .
where are you ?
why don &apos;t you call ?
why did you leave without saying good @-@ bye ?
you &apos;re supposed to be my best friend .
i miss you so much .
love , blair .
why didn &apos;t you send it ?
i would &apos;ve--
you would &apos;ve what ?
you knew , serena ,
and you didn &apos;t even call .
i didn &apos;t know what to say to you
or even how to be your friend after what i did .
i &apos;m so sorry .
eric told me what happened .
i guess your family &apos;s been going through a hard time , too .
spotted in central park--
two white flags waving .
could an upper east side peace accord be far off ?
so what will it be--
truce or consequences ?
we all know one nation can &apos;t have two queens .
what happens next ?
only time will tell .
