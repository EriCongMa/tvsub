Did you actually read any of his book?
Ezra knew who I was before we met.
He knew who all of us were.
Do you always carry that much cash around?
Who is the money for?
The money is for Ali. She's alive.
AD公司 邮政信箱537 宾州 瓦林福德镇
How did it go?
That cop, Holbrook, spoke up for my dad.
I was surprised to hear that you spoke for Mr. Hobbs.
Thank you.
Okay, stop. What are you up to?
Your mother and I spoke with Dr. Griggs this morning.
He recommended a rehab facility in Philly.
Ezra is moving forward with the book.
He is meeting with his agent in New York right now
discussing a release date.
Now I know that everything he says
or has ever said is a lie.
Are you going somewhere?
That's the plan. I got to get out of here.
It's a simple question, okay.
Did you or did you not see me standing
with a shovel that night?
And if you did see me hurt Ali,
then why didn't you just call the cops?
Anything for the dry cleaners?
It was 3 days in rehab, Mom.
I really did not need so many sweaters.
I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside
for some fresh air or if you got cold.
I did get cold and then I got the sweats.
You know, withdrawal symptoms
can't really be stopped with a cable knit.
They said that the medical detox
would help mitigate your discomfort.
It did, Mom.
I was so comfortable kicking my drug habit.
Sorry.
I'm very irritable.
They said to expect irritability over the next few days.
As long as you're home and well, I can handle it.
Don't you walk away from me.
Is there anything you need?
There's left-over carbonara
or I can make a salad if you'd like something lighter.
You're way out of your league, Spencer.
You sure about that?
Put that thing down before you hurt yourself.
Spencer?
I said you look tired.
Maybe you should get some rest.
We have some things to discuss in the morning.
Mom? Have you seen my car keys?
I want to get to school early and catch up on
any assignments that I might have missed.
Oh, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Honey, this is Dean Stavros.
He's going to be staying with us for a while.
Sweetheart, you're not going back to school just yet.
We've already taken your car keys.
I'll need your cellphone and your laptop as well.
But why?
There will be no phone calls of any kind,
no internet, no friends.
We'll be sure to get your assignments from school.
And how do you expect me to turn them in?
Carrier pigeon?
You'll earn your privileges back over time,
as long as you follow Dean's program.
The doctor said that I was fine to go back to school,
as long as I agreed to outpatient counseling.
Could you please excuse us?
I need to talk to my mom.
Actually, I don't think I can.
Spencer, I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
Your parents brought me here to help you.
I'm gonna be camped out in the barn, on-call 24/7--
So you're basically a baby-sitter.
Do you and Dad distrust me this much?
Quite frankly, given this latest episode, yes.
I understand you may be feeling a little ambushed.
Excuse me.
How long am I supposed to stay under guard?
I have to apologize for my daughter.
Oh, as long as you're handing them out,
I would love an apology from you.
Your father and I thought the first time
would be the last.
Since you've relapsed--
I would hardly call this a relapse.
Spencer, look, I bet your mom would be
a whole lot more open to hearing you out
if you hand over your electronics.
Show her you're willing to cooperate.
Can I please just call Toby?
I tried him last night and he hasn't called me back yet.
I've had a conversation with Toby
and he understands that you'll be hard
to reach for the time being.
It will give us all a chance to focus.
Great.
Where do we start?
Fantastic.
I will go upstairs and fill this with my dignity.
I'm still at Syracuse.
Does your dad know what happened?
No. No.
He thinks I'm here for a Prospective Student Week.
It's 4 days of campus tours, classroom visits,
and a bunch of father-daughter bonding time.
How are you doing? Really.
Um, honestly, I'm just trying not to think about any of it.
Him. Everything.
You don't have to go through this on your own.
You know, we can all come up there.
No, it's okay.
I'm not alone.
I just mean that my dad's here with me.
Look, I've got to go.
The tour's starting. Bye.
Morning, sunshine.
No, don't start. You look worse than me.
No. I don't.
You ready to learn about the history
of this illustrious institution?
I'm ready for some sleep or coffee.
I don't know, an aspirin.
Yeah, my student host didn't exactly
offer continental breakfast.
Okay, everyone, over here for the tour please.
We--we really need to go on this thing?
I know a place nearby.
Killer pancakes.
You mean bail on the tour?
Only if you want.
I want.
All right.
Give those back. I need them.
This way, over here.
Aria finally called me this morning.
Is she still mad at me?
She's not mad, she's hurting.
But she sounded okay.
Distant.
Are we still going to Spencer's later?
It was so weird.
I called her cell and her mom answered.
There's no visitors
and she's not gonna be in school for a while.
Probably for the best.
I saw Fitz's car in the teacher's parking lot.
Wait, he's back?
So he just goes to New York to collect
the big, fat check for selling us out.
And then what, comes back here to gloat?
I wish you would have told me this before I bought tickets.
Do you want to go at all?
I'm sorry, Mike. I don't know what to say.
Give me a call when you figure it out.
Looks like he's still pulling Mona's strings.
Do you think Fitz was behind whatever that was?
I mean, Mike and Mona didn't really make much sense unless...
Unless she was spying on Aria for him.
Now I'm mad. We should say something.
Are you coming?
I can't.
If you're gonna slash his tires or bust his headlights,
I'd still be down.
But I don't want to be in the same room with him.
I know. I get it.
Hey, I'm gonna ditch last period.
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Emily, class doesn't start for another few minutes.
Okay, I don't know how much you know
but as close as you are to Aria,
I can assume that you know everything.
I really want to talk to you about this, Emily,
but I would really prefer
if it were outside of a classroom.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've already talked to you outside of the classroom.
I let you help me with my college essays.
You tutored me.
You helped me when I lost my girlfriend.
Why did you do all of that?
What did you get out of it?
There's an assignment due today,
but I won't be staying for the class.
Will you make sure a real teacher gets this?
Don't get up.
I don't want to accidentally run into your mouth again.
Is that what that was?
Look, it wasn't supposed to happen.
And it's not going to ever again.
I promise.
I'm sure Travis will be glad to hear that.
After court, when I passed the two of you talking,
it seemed like there was a look.
Do you have a minute to sit?
You know, I actually just came to apologize.
I just-- I thought it would be weird
if I saw you and I didn't say anything.
Is there anything else you want to talk about?
No. I'm good.
Well, there's a couple of things I'd like to ask you.
Please sit.
What do you know about this?
I've never seen this before.
You recognize the handwriting?
Why don't you open it up, read the note inside?
It might look familiar.
AD公司 邮政信箱537 宾州 瓦林福德镇
What is this?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I didn't write it, if that's what you're asking.
I thought it was a possibility.
OK. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask.
Well, you don't think that's real, do you?
I mean you're not going to go
looking for Alison now, are you?
No, don't worry.
We get stuff like that all the time.
It's probably just another crackpot.
I have to go meet my mom for dinner.
It's a little early for that, don't you think?
It's my turn to cook.
That's good. No, keep playing.
No, I just- I just wanted to give Antonio a little air.
Oh, you named your guitar Antonio?
I like to think Antonio named himself.
You slept well?
Um, yeah, a little bit.
I still feel like my head's a bowling ball,
but I don't think I'm gonna yak on my shoes anymore.
Hey, that's progress.
You don't normally drink, do you?
This week's anything but normal.
Why is that?
Oh, we missed the last tour, huh?
We can learn about the Hall of Languages
and the billion dollar endowment another day.
So your dad... I thought you were staying with your dad.
I am. Yeah, he's- he's just right next door.
So what does he profess?
Art history.
You into art, too?
A little.
Um, I like to write,
but who knows now.
What- what are you looking for?
Hair of the dog.
That's supposed to cure hangover, right?
God, we totally raided this thing.
Who drank the pineapple rum?
Guilty.
How much do you think all this stuff cost?
No, not too much a lot.
Maybe a couple of hundred dollars.
I'm serious.
Me, too.
Just tell your dad you had the drunkies.
And invited a boy over.
Yeah.
Mm, I think that will go over real well.
Somebody else knows Alison's alive
and they just told the cops.
Does Holbrook know who it's from?
Did he say if it was from a guy or a girl?
It's anonymous.
And they're still trying to figure it out.
I'll be right back.
What's up?
Your text said I should come find you.
Yeah, my mom wanted to invite you and your family over for dinner
just to say thanks for everything.
That's really nice of her,
but she doesn't have to go through that.
Trust me, you don't want to miss it.
She doesn't really cook often,
but when she does it's pretty amazing.
Okay.
You know, I was thinking
maybe you and I could do a meal sometime.
Just the two of us.
Sure.
Wait, is that like a date?
I actually hope it will be.
How about tomorrow night?
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Did he just ask you out?
Okay, I'm not digging the timing, but...
Are you even ready for that?
No, I'm ready.
I just hope nothing else crazy happens between now and then.
Drinking a glass of salad
is supposed to give me my life back?
Your body needs the nutrition.
You'll feel stronger, you'll think clearer,
you'll sleep better.
I sleep just fine.
I heard you doing laundry at 2:00 in the morning.
My sheets were dirty.
What, do you want to analyze those, too?
I just thought it was unusual.
You know, with ADHD meds people tend to
sleep a lot during withdrawal.
And you're definitely irritable.
Any flu-like symptoms?
Not anymore.
What about nightmares?
Um, what about hallucinations?
Maybe.
They're nothing to worry about.
It's just your mind and body getting reacquainted.
Take drugs away and things come up.
What kind of things?
Things you've forgotten.
Things you've suppressed.
Things you need to deal with.
When I was first in recovery,
a healthy diet and exercise really worked for me.
I mean, it took the edge off.
It's worth a try.
Ever do yoga?
No, not usually.
I don't really excel at athletics
unless there's somebody to beat.
I'd like to avoid competition.
I think that drive may have triggered your abuse
in the first place.
But kicking your ass at tennis
might be very therapeutic.
Yeah, I get the feeling
you'd like to kick my ass, period.
But I'm in the barn
until your parents and doctor say otherwise.
So get motivated.
We've got a lot to cover today.
I'm just gonna take a quick shower.
Toby, hey, please I really, really need to talk to you.
I'm starting to worry because I haven't heard from you.
I just need you to tell me that I'm not,
like, a horrible person.
How come I don't hear any running water?
Hanna,
I know what you did.
And I am not amused.
Since when is getting a skinny latte a crime?
We're not here to joke around, Hanna.
Gabe, what is she talking about?
It won't be hard for me to match your handwriting to the note.
When I do, I'll have to bring you down for questioning.
Hanna, if there's anything else you have to say
about the note, now is the time.
She's not going to find anything.
I swear, I didn't write it.
"Good cop, bad cop," I thought that would do the job,
but she's one tough little cookie.
I kind of like her.
We arrested her mother and we were wrong.
And we put that family through hell.
My gut tells me that she's trying to do the same thing.
She's giving us the runaround.
I know this girl.
Something doesn't jive.
I think that note's legit.
You're on your own with that theory.
But keep an eye on her.
Let's see if she takes this to one of her friends.
Maybe they're all in on it.
Is that your dad?
Yep.
He wants to take me into some restaurant tonight,
a little quality father-daughter time.
Jeremiah's?
Yeah.
How did you know that?
That's the only good vegetarian place around here.
How do you know so much about SU?
I thought that you were from Cedar Rapids.
I am. But my parents went to school here.
They met on campus in chem lab, freshman year.
I have three older sisters
and they all graduated from Syracuse, too.
Summa cum laude.
Let me guess.
You don't want to continue the tradition?
I got into Berklee College of Music.
Wow. That's amazing.
Yeah, well, my parents don't think
music is the kind of thing you study.
What about you?
I-- I love music.
You know what I mean.
You clearly didn't come here to look at a college.
Um, some jerk just broke my heart into,
like, 30,000 million pieces.
That's a lot.
Tell me about it.
Anyway, so, yeah, he's back home and that's why I'm here.
Just needed to disappear for a little bit, I guess.
That doesn't seem right.
He's the jerk, but you're the one in exile?
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
Not that I'm complaining or anything.
Yeah, you better not be.
I can finish this.
Why don't you go up and put your laundry away?
Okay.
Thanks.
I'll get it.
Spencer.
Veronica, may I come in?
I was just stopping by to see
if you got the flyer I left in your mailbox
about the bridal show fund-raiser.
I did.
I didn't get your RSVP.
Oh. I'll have to check the calendar.
I'll be right back.
You're looking well.
Your mother told me that you had a bug.
Your outburst at my home was a reaction
to some over-the-counter medication?
Yeah, yeah.
Next time I'll be sure to buy name brand.
I'm so sorry for everything that I said
and for the way that I grabbed you.
I really was not myself.
No apology necessary.
My guess is she's in there writing a check.
I wouldn't expect her to attend.
But it's all for a good cause.
You know, the charity feeds starving children.
No mother should have to watch her child die.
I should probably just take my laundry up
and go to bed.
Nothing beats a good night's sleep
on a set of fresh, clean sheets.
I'm sorry, Jessica.
We have another commitment that night.
I hope this helps.
Thank you. I so appreciate your generosity.
Goodbye, Spencer.
Well, you sure do look nice.
You ready for our last big day?
I actually just came by to let you know
I'm gonna cut out early.
Head back home.
Maybe take Antonio on the scenic route.
You're gonna go talk to your folks about Berklee?
That's the plan.
Look, I just wanted to say,
I thought this was gonna be a pretty unbearable week
and it ended up being pretty great.
So thank you.
You should find me if you're ever in Rosewood.
Count on it.
Bye.
Thank you.
Hey. Have you talked to Aria?
Not today. Why?
She's not answering any of my calls or texts.
Look, if you hear from her, tell her I said, "Thanks."
Mike, hold on.
Can you take over for a sec?
Thanks.
What's going on?
Aria got what she wanted.
Mona dumped me this morning.
I got a text really early that said we're done.
Just like that.
Okay, I'm sorry that happened
but I don't think Aria was involved.
Oh, so the fact that you guys can't stand her
has nothing to do with it?
I can't think of another reason
why Mona would just cut me off like a wart.
Maybe I could talk to her.
Find out what's going on.
Whatever.
Just tell Aria to call me.
Hey, we just did 3 loops, that's 3 miles.
And now we're doing an extra loop
for your little phone stunt yesterday.
God, why are you so mean, Dean?
Because you make me tense, Spence.
I mean how long are you gonna keep this up?
Rhyming? I could go all day.
I can see that you're a smart girl
with a sharp tongue, and you love to spar.
But getting under my skin isn't the goal here.
It's getting under yours so we can address
what's really going on.
Do you have any interest in that?
One more mile. Let's go.
Damn it, Ali, I said stop it.
Hey, hey, take a deep breath.
Now tell me what's going on.
I think I know what I did.
Do you ever think that sometimes people see you
more clearly than you see yourself?
I'm not sure what you mean.
There are things that happened
that I don't remember and other people do.
And you're using their memories to fill in the blanks?
Yeah. What else can I do?
Well, maybe recalling what really happened
is a little too much to wrap your head around right now.
I mean I should have known
that I was capable of something like this.
I've done bad things before.
Wait.
Look, before you go to that place,
I want you to look at what happened today as a positive.
It sounds like to me, at least emotionally,
you're ready to take responsibility for your actions.
You want to know what you did,
maybe make good on a few things.
How am I supposed to take responsibility?
I mean if I-- if I really did this.
Did what, Spencer?
Nothing. Nothing. I'm sorry.
I'm really talked-out right now.
I think we've covered enough.
I'm gonna give you some space
so you can read that.
Just so you know, I'm a picker.
So whatever I order,
the other person's plate always looks better.
What does that even mean?
It means whatever you order, get a side of garlic bread.
Hanna?
Hi, Mrs. D.
Don't you look lovely tonight?
Are we on a date?
Yeah. Yeah. This is Travis.
Nice to meet you.
Such a gentleman.
I won't keep you.
You two enjoy yourselves.
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
Lieutenant Tanner.
Detective Holbrook.
Please come with us.
I'm sorry. This will just take one moment.
Uh, so if you want the garlic bread,
maybe I should order the lasagna.
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
I need to talk to you.
I have somewhere to be.
Going to meet with Ezra Fitz?
Get in.
Aria.
Can I come in?
Why would you help him?
I'm surprised it took you this long to figure it out.
And I kind of expected it would be Aria.
He should have told her about the book a long time ago.
When did you find out?
Around the time I bought Jenna's car.
But I didn't want to help him with his tattle-tale,
I wanted to stop him.
Or at least, stop the parts that included me,
some of the stuff I did, I could still go to jail for.
So we made a deal.
I would answer questions about my exploits,
and he'd edit out anything I did that was less than legal.
Did you read the book?
Do you know what it says about Alison?
If Alison were alive,
I'm sure she'd love being
the focus of a scandalous page-turner.
But no, Ezra only showed me parts of chapters
I was written into.
I never saw the whole thing.
I didn't come here to hash things out.
I came here to tell you that you need to leave.
Yeah, I understand you need your space.
No, I don't think that you understand.
I do.
I spoke with Hackett yesterday
and I'm taking a leave of absence.
No, Ezra.
You need to leave town. For good.
Aria, we can work through this.
I don't want to work through this.
I don't want to run into you at the grocery
or every time I grab coffee with my friends
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear from you. Ever.
So you dated Mike to get closer to Aria,
so you could spy on her.
Mike's a really sweet guy.
I fell for him.
When you guys started to catch on,
I tried to tell Fitz I wanted out.
He said that wasn't an option.
I didn't want to drag Mike into my mess, so I let him go.
You went through all that and got nothing?
Not nothing.
It's murky, but it's big.
Remember, after the lodge burned down,
I told you all that someone stole the game from me
when I was in Radley?
We all thought it was CeCe.
I never found out.
But whoever it is, Ezra thinks he knows.
This is a copy of my manuscript.
Thanks, but I think I'll wait till it's in the clearance bin.
I really think you should read it.
I found some stuff out that can really help you.
And for what it's worth,
I was in New York returning my publisher's advance.
I thought if I pulled the plug--
It's too late, Ezra.
Well, I guess this is good-bye then.
I'm about to kill this dessert.
You'd better jump in if you want a bite.
Oh, no, you can finish it.
Something wrong?
Look, Travis, I'm so sorry.
I've got to go.
Can I please just pay for my half?
I don't go dutch on the first date.
You sure everything's okay?
Do you want me to drop you somewhere?
No, it's just a friend.
I knew something was up.
You've been distracted almost the whole night.
And it's not just since that text came in.
I'm just a little rusty.
It's been a while since I've been on a date.
Come on, this wasn't a date.
Your phone makes a lousy third wheel.
Look, it won't happen again, I promise.
I just-- I really have to go.
Thanks.
Look, I know it didn't seem like it,
but I had a really great time.
So you think that Mona left that anonymous tip?
Well, if she was upset that she had to dump Mike,
maybe she was trying to make Fitz pay.
It could all lead back to Ezra.
It might stop him from publishing
while they investigate.
Em, how long has this been there?
What-- What are you talking about?
The blue envelope.
It's a note from Paige. Why?
Sorry.
I had to finish reading it to be sure, but--
Ezra gave me a copy of his book.
You talked to him?
Mona dumped your brother,
and he thinks you made her do it,
but really it was because of Ezra.
Sorry. Housekeeping.
Yeah, I'll deal with that.
You're back. Are you better?
Better, yeah, but it's your SOS,
so why don't you go first?
Okay, there is something that Ezra wanted us to know.
I thought you went to Syracuse to get away from him?
What changed?
I-- I just figured out how to say what needed to be said.
And then he gave me a copy of his book.
You guys, you're never going to believe this,
but Ezra thinks that "A" Is Ali's mom.
Are you sure that's what it says
that Mrs. DiLaurentis is "A"?
That's ridiculous. How old is she?
Does she even know how to text?
"A" has been telling us to stop going after Alison
probably because "A" wants to bring her home.
But that's exactly what we've been trying to do.
Why would Mrs. DiLaurentis think that we were in the way?
Maybe because she thinks I tried to kill Ali.
When did Ali's mom accuse you of attempted murder?
And why are you just now telling us this?
Look, the other night I found a bunch of dirt
in the bottom of my bed
and Ali's mom made some cryptic comment about it.
Don't pin that on her.
I mean that sounds like an "A" move.
Which is why I think she's "A."
Mrs. D being "A" makes about as much sense
as you whacking Ali over the head with a shovel.
I could have.
CeCe told Ezra that both she and Mrs. DiLaurentis
saw me pick up a shovel and go after Ali.
But Alison is still alive.
We argued that night, okay.
And we'd all been drinking
but I was also on amphetamines.
I don't remember anything
and lately I've been seeing things.
I don't know if it's just me coming off of the drugs
or if it is a guilty conscience.
But if two people saw me--
Why believe anything CeCe says?
Because it wasn't just CeCe.
Ezra put it in his book, okay.
He thinks that one of us tried to kill her
and that person is probably me.
The only person that knows what really happened is Alison.
Yeah, and she's not here to help us, is she?
I can't talk about this anymore.
I'm gonna get a snack.
Somebody want anything?
Yeah, sure.
I'm not hungry.
I'll come with you.
Hey, Em, can I ask you something?
We don't have any cheesy puffs.
My mom says the orange powder has chemicals in it
that make you break out.
No, it's-- look, it's important
and I need you to tell me the truth.
You told Paige that Alison's alive, didn't you?
Dad put some leftovers in the fridge for you.
I ate 'em.
It's fine, I had something at Emily's.
I heard about Mona.
Mike, I'm really sorry.
I know how much it hurts.
You know that I would never--
I know.
It was just easier to blame you
than admit you were right all along.
Maybe about this.
But there are plenty of other things
that I'm wrong about.
Are we going to have to lock you in your room at night?
Mom, I'm sorry.
It was really, really important.
More important than staying sober?
No.
Were you out looking for drugs?
What? Mom, no.
The drawer was open.
Did you-- give me your phone.
What does "SOS" mean?
And why were you meeting up at Emily's?
Hanging out with your friends,
that's what was so important?
I'm about ready to throw my hands up.
You keep flirting with disaster no matter
how hard we try to protect you.
Maybe you should stop.
It's about a quarter past sarcasm, Spencer.
You want to try another tone?
I'm not being sarcastic.
You and Dad said that you covered for me
that summer when I was first using.
What did you mean?
Because I still don't remember.
Consider it a blessing.
I'm going to bed.
I suggest you do the same.
Spencer?
Spencer?
Are you okay?
