yeah ?
uh , mrs. florrick , sorry ,
the other bathroom &apos;s clogged .
okay .
thank you .
can i go to the jamboree ?
why are you whispering ?
eli said to .
it &apos;s something shannon &apos;s going to next weekend .
it &apos;s a campus faith jamboree .
no , it &apos;s not like what you think .
it &apos;s like a social .
you don &apos;t even have to believe in it or anything .
why did eli say we should whisper ?
oh , yeah-- he phoned and said that dad needed his rest ,
&apos;cause of his debate .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
do you want some french toast ?
shannon made it .
tell her about the jamboree .
tell mom about the jamboree .
it &apos;s really cool , mrs. florrick .
like , you sing and you , like , play games .
it &apos;s really good for preteen self @-@ esteem .
the toilet &apos;s clogged .
shh ! we &apos;re trying to let dad sleep .
eli said .
today is dad &apos;s debate .
who &apos;s this , mrs. florrick ?
oh , he &apos;s a guy who killed his wife and her boyfriend .
allegedly killed his wife and her boyfriend .
they &apos;re gonna execute him tonight .
unless my mom &apos;s appeal works .
unless the firm &apos;s appeal works .
i got it .
shut up .
he &apos;s got a new girlfriend .
it &apos;s a study partner .
okay , could you all just stop growing up so quickly ?
this is really good .
i told you .
she &apos;ll be with you in a second .
um , some guy , uh , collagan ?
kerrigan ?
i &apos;ll take it in the ...
he got jealous that his wife was divorcing him ,
so he burned down her home .
whoa . i wish i lived here .
yes . this is alicia florrick .
hello , mrs. florrick .
this is jason kerrigan .
with the seventh circuit court of appeals .
yes . is everything all right ?
yes . you filed the final habeas petition
for carter wright last night , correct ?
yes .
i &apos;m calling to ask if , uh , you &apos;ll be filing an addendum
before tonight &apos;s execution .
i &apos;m sorry , can you ... repeat that ?
will you be filing an addendum to the brief ?
mrs. florrick ?
uh , yes , uh , an addendum .
we will be .
let me phone you back , if you don &apos;t mind .
i don &apos;t mind , but i &apos;m under a bit of a ...
okay . it &apos;s okay .
call me within the hour .
it &apos;s saturday-- i said no calls .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , will-- it &apos;s alicia .
oh . hey , sorry , i thought it was work .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i mean ...
it might be nothing .
last night i turned in the appeal
on the carter wright execution , and i ...
approximately two minutes ago ,
the seventh circuit clerk phoned me back
and he asked ... if i had an addendum .
will ?
so , tell me what he said exactly .
he phoned me , and he said they received our appeal
and he wanted to know when he could expect an addendum .
and you never said anything about an addendum ?
no .
when i turned it in friday night ,
no , i didn &apos;t say anything .
but ...
did he phone the office ?
no , he phoned my home .
i don &apos;t understand-- why did he phone your home ?
i put that number on the buck slip--
if he had any questions .
where was it left ?
i said i would be phoning him back about our addendum .
good . when does he expect your call ?
within the hour .
okay . i have to phone diane .
i &apos;ll phone you right back . stay there , okay ?
oh . can i just go back and answer that ?
what &apos;s up ? i thought you were off the grid .
alicia just got a call from the clerk at the seventh circuit ,
asking if we have an addendum on our appeal .
you &apos;re hearing me , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
what did alicia say ?
she said she &apos;d phone him right back .
good girl . uh , wh @-@ where are you ?
heading back .
gonna try to pull in whoever i can on a saturday . you &apos;re there ?
yes . i was just going in to see him ,
try to keep him calm .
do you know the clerk at the 7th ?
no . he didn &apos;t say anything else ?
no . hopefully , alicia can get more when she phones back .
maybe it should be one of us phoning .
nah , this guy &apos;s breaking the rules
trying to tell us there &apos;s something we missed
without actually telling us there &apos;s something we missed .
if we treat this out of the ordinary , he &apos;ll bolt .
he might also be telling us we have an opportunity .
a last hail mary appeal ?
you need to get someplace where you can talk .
i &apos;m sending kalinda over to alicia right now .
good . i &apos;ll- i &apos;ll phone you in 30 minutes .
step through , please .
step back , please .
how you doing ?
i slept .
good .
you hear anything ?
the judges didn &apos;t say anything ?
n- no .
but we just submitted it last night .
i got the warden
to agree to a phone call with your daughter .
yeah .
that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s been ten years .
i don &apos;t even blame her .
ruby &apos;s moved on .
you have to know what you want to know .
your mom ?
yeah , but you can &apos;t just throw her out there .
you work with my mom ?
yeah .
sure .
and you &apos;re sure
the clerk said addendum , not amendment ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
okay , so it &apos;s very important
you don &apos;t seem overly eager for information
when you call him back .
that &apos;s right .
the most important thing to do is sound casual .
you &apos;re just proofreading the addendum .
keep him talking-- the more he gives us , the better .
and try to get him to point
to a specific section of the brief .
or ask if there is a section missing .
but he might get suspicious ,
so don &apos;t ask him too many direct questions .
i think that alicia should play this one by ear .
yes , of course .
anything he gives us will be helpful .
good , kalinda . keep us on your cell .
sure .
you okay ?
seventh circuit appellate court .
oh , hi . this is alicia florrick .
we spoke about an hour ago .
you had inquired about an addendum .
yeah .
uh , well , i was going through our appeal ...
they &apos;re all waiting on you .
do you want me to phone back ?
no , no , that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll be right in .
i was here going through our appeal ,
and i was just wondering ,
uh , which section you were referring to .
which ... what ?
i can &apos;t recall which section ...
uh , you said that you felt was incomplete .
just tell him you &apos;ll talk later .
look , i &apos;m here till 6 : 00 .
if you have an addendum to file ,
he needs it by then .
do you understand ?
i understand , but why don &apos;t we talk later-- you sound busy .
stay by the phone .
well , we have a deadline :
6 : 00 p.m.
great . nine hours to figure out what we missed ,
or carter dies .
ladies and gentle ... ladies and gentlemen !
thank you for your attention , people .
there are two possibilities here , ladies and gentlemen .
either we overlooked something ...
... or ...
we are being pointed toward an opportunity .
this clerk is telling us we have a chance .
so , we have nine hours--
nine hours to save a man &apos;s life .
legal aid ... this case came from your team ,
so i want you to head down to the 27th floor
and look through every sentence , word , comma .
did we overlook anything ?
executions have gone through because of a typo .
lockhart &amp; gardner people ,
we need to look into this clerk
and the three judges of the seventh circuit .
is this clerk acting on his own here ,
or is he doing it for one of the persuadable judges ?
is there anything in their background
to suggest where we should be focusing our appeal ?
we only need to focus on two judges .
what do you mean ?
well , the clerk said
he needed the addendum by 6 : 00 .
okay , good , there are two
male judges on the panel hearing our appeal--
let &apos;s look into both of them .
kalinda , what do you have on the clerk so far ?
um ... not much .
uh , jason kerrigan ,
29 years old ,
yale undergrad ,
captain of the water polo team ,
harvard law .
he &apos;s too young to leave much of a paper trail .
but he did work for the innocence project in 2008 .
good , that &apos;s good .
is he seeing something
in the evidence that we should see ?
let &apos;s look into someone who knew him there .
what ?
the innocence project 2008 ?
you know who worked there ?
who ?
cary .
we have a lead on someone who knew him there .
hanging up now .
you &apos;re not gonna try him ...
course i am .
he won &apos;t help us .
on your left , here , this is a , uh , dorm ...
i think ...
i have a crush on you .
that &apos;s the science lab , over there .
no , you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not a little girl anymore , cary .
i &apos;m 18 .
molly . you &apos;re my first cousin ,
and your parents are trusting me
to show you around chicago universities .
i looked it up . it &apos;s not incest .
oh , boy .
okay . i got to take this .
i &apos;ll catch up with you . behave .
hello .
hey , cary , guess what i need ?
ah , kalinda .
i imagine you need something i can &apos;t give you till monday .
no . i can &apos;t wait till then .
listen , i need to know everything about jason kerrigan .
jason kerrigan ?
he &apos;s a clerk at the seventh circuit appellate court .
yeah , you two worked at the innocence project together .
no .
yes .
2008 .
no , i mean , &quot; no , you &apos;re not getting anything from me . &quot;
this is about your death row appeal .
oh , come on , cary .
this is indiana death row .
your boss never has to find out .
look , here &apos;s an idea :
come back to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
start putting these wife @-@ killers onto death row ,
instead of getting them off .
as good as you are at getting people off .
you didn &apos;t really say that , did you ?
good to talk to you , kalinda .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re working a hail mary pass with this appeal .
okay . you want me to get mom to take care of the kids ?
definitely , because that &apos;s all we need here .
okay . yeah , yeah .
jim has to take me through the debate prep .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i have to stay by the phone .
the appellate court might call back .
hey , don &apos;t worry about it .
did you try the french toast ?
yep . five times .
peter ?
do you know anything about the seventh circuit judges ?
which one ?
the men .
any reason they would tip on a death row appeal ?
well , not oxley .
but i heard that glendon got remarried and was going soft .
glendon ?
don &apos;t say it came from me .
you have to keep your tough stance on the death penalty ?
it &apos;s the only way to win .
and there &apos;s jackie . see ?
you just have to think her name and she appears .
no .
my goodness . i forgot my keys .
glendon ?
i thought glendon was law and order .
i just got off with kalinda and alicia .
the word is he married
a religious anti @-@ death @-@ penalty type .
then we should be pursuing actual innocence .
our arguments were too technical .
glendon wants to go our way ,
but he needs innocence to hang his hat on .
yep , we &apos;re heading downstairs now .
gonna run through the trial transcripts with legal aid ,
see what other suspects were overlooked .
hey . one thing .
don &apos;t let legal aid run with this , okay ?
i argued for legal aid to pursue innocence ,
and i think they fumbled .
you got it .
okay . i &apos;ve got a call coming in .
hello ! i hope to learn each and every one of your names .
but in the meantime ,
we &apos;re taking lunch orders for sandwiches ,
so if you have a moment ...
just write your orders down there .
lockhart / gardner is picking up the tab .
they &apos;re gonna try to bully you , provoke you .
they smell blood in the water ,
and they want to tear you to pieces .
stay out .
is that french toast ?
leave it . go .
where &apos;s my position on capital punishment ?
you &apos;re not changing your position on capital punishment .
you know that alicia &apos;s working
on the carter wright appeal , don &apos;t you ?
you know , some industrious reporter
is going to point out the contradiction .
they &apos;re going after family ,
because they see you lose your cool
when they come after family .
so don &apos;t .
you always get quiet when you get angry .
just keep talking . change the subject .
ruby ?
it &apos;s just me here .
no family .
there &apos;s nobody else .
ruby ?
it just ... it hurts so much .
i @-@ i know .
but if you don &apos;t see him ,
i think , maybe ,
in a week or a year ,
it &apos;ll hurt more .
he keeps saying he &apos;s innocent ?
yes .
do you believe him ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i wish i could tell you 100 %
he &apos;s innocent or guilty ,
but whenever i &apos;ve been 100 % certain about anything ,
i &apos;ve been proven wrong .
the only thing i know
is nobody should be without family when he dies .
how long do i have ?
to get here ?
three hours .
they only allow visitation until 2 : 00 .
i don &apos;t think i can make it . i &apos;m in avon .
come .
i will talk to the warden .
just come . don &apos;t go home .
i look like a mess .
ruby , please .
come . right now .
it all started when carter and his wife caroline
separated in 2000 .
one month later ,
caroline &apos;s apartment burned down .
the fire was deemed suspicious .
carter had no alibi for that night .
and he had the motive .
jealousy .
caroline took up with another man , also killed in the fire .
other suspects ?
the public defender took a stab at him--
a , uh , frank gephart .
testified for the prosecution .
said that carter and caroline fought constantly .
gephart was also a former business partner of carter &apos;s .
they dissolved their landscaping business in late 1998 .
so frank wanted carter dead ,
tried to burn him alive ,
but didn &apos;t know caroline already kicked carter out .
okay , find him .
don &apos;t go in hard .
keep me in touch .
you understand , ms. lockhart ,
the protocols for lethal injection
are regimented and exact .
you &apos;re asking me to break my own rules .
i am , sir .
i &apos;m asking you to make an exception
and let this man see his daughter before he dies .
i &apos;m going to ask something in return , ms. lockhart .
the last hours are very hard for any man ,
and mr. wright will be emotional if he sees his daughter .
i need you to calm him .
i don &apos;t want trouble getting him to the gurney .
do you understand ?
to the best of my ability , i will .
do you agree to extend the visitation hours ?
hold on a second . mr. barkin ?
the anesthetist .
i have to take this .
do i have your approval ?
let me take this , and we &apos;ll talk .
warden barkin .
i just think we can get a delay with this .
what &apos;s it called again ?
it &apos;s sodium thiopental ,
the first part in a three @-@ drug cocktail .
it &apos;s the barbiturate to put him to sleep .
and they &apos;re out of it ?
how can they be out of it ?
the drug expired .
their executions are so infrequent , it expired ,
so they &apos;re switching to another anesthetic .
okay , i &apos;m on my way to request a delay .
oh , and ask carter about frank gephart .
who is that ? is that the new suspect ?
yeah , a bitter ex @-@ business @-@ partner of carter &apos;s .
i just sent blake out to get anything he can on him .
julius , your tie .
whatever carter has will be helpful .
okay , i &apos;ll ask .
but we need another week on all of this .
you &apos;re telling me .
maybe i just won &apos;t go to college .
it &apos;s an option .
become a vagabond . write about your adventures .
i thought this was a weekend .
no weekend for the wicked .
hello ?
cary ? this is barry scheck .
do you have a moment ?
sure i have a moment , mr. scheck .
let me just hang up with f. lee bailey on the other line .
i ...
just ... just hold on a second .
all right .
what do you need , barry , old buddy ?
you know about the carter wright death row appeal , don &apos;t you ?
do i know about it ? i &apos;ve got tickets .
i &apos;m headed there right now .
in fact , i got an extra ticket , if you want to join me .
cary . this is barry scheck .
yes . yes , i know . i know .
do the ... do the funny voice with the barry scheck on helium .
okay , let me start again .
lockhart &amp; gardner
needs your help on a death row appeal .
and i thought because of your internship at the innocence project ,
and my friendship with your father ,
that you might consider helping out for a few hours .
michael ?
no . barry .
this isn &apos;t michael in vice ?
no , this is barry scheck in ... here .
hello , mr. scheck .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i ... this ...
uh , this guy ...
what do you need ?
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can . just like this .
yeah , but i don &apos;t believe it .
you don &apos;t have to ; you just do it , and it works .
it &apos;s like a genie .
okay , i &apos;ll pray .
what &apos;s the name of the guy who &apos;s getting executed ?
i don &apos;t think you should do this .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
it just ... it feels weird .
okay , i &apos;ll pray that he won &apos;t be executed .
i just need to ask you , jesus :
please save this man &apos;s life .
this man on death row .
only you know his real heart ,
but i just ask you that you stop this from happening to him .
carter wright .
i just pray that you stop this from happening to carter wright .
in jesus &apos;s name , i pray .
and my dad &apos;s debate ?
that &apos;s your husband , mrs. gephart ?
ex .
oh , sorry .
i need to talk to him .
you have any idea where he is ?
well , i know where his ashes are .
would that help ?
what ? did he owe you money ?
no . i &apos;m here about carter wright .
i knew it was something like that .
he &apos;s going down tonight , i heard .
midnight .
carter poached frank &apos;s clients .
took them with him to his new company .
frank never forgave him .
do you have any reason to believe frank
had something to do with the fire ?
i got reason to believe anything about frank .
but , um , no .
he was with me that night .
at the movies .
okay , that sucks .
well , she &apos;s willing to say anything we want .
i mean , i could pursue that if you like .
no . we got another path .
head back to the office .
we got a lead on the clerk .
we struck out on frank gephart .
what do you know , cary ?
okay , first of all , i &apos;m here for this ,
and nothing else .
understood .
what can you tell us about your old friend , this clerk ?
jason read a new yorker article
about the execution of cameron todd willingham ,
and it moved him .
he wrote a paper about
flawed science in government cases , or something like that .
now , the harvard review never printed it .
it &apos;s probably sitting in a drawer somewhere .
can you get us a copy ?
yeah , i can dig it up for you .
alicia , kalinda , you guys still on it ?
yeah .
you know what this is about ?
the arson science .
methods for arson investigation
have developed over the last ten years .
track down the arson expert who testified at the trial .
see if his story has changed .
she &apos;s coming ?
yes .
the warden will make an exception
if she gets here ... soon .
when ?
soon .
ms. lockhart , thank you for staying with me ,
but i need you to talk to me like i &apos;m an adult .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
ruby needs to be here by 3 : 00 .
she &apos;s driving from avon .
it will be close .
thank you .
now , why were you asking me about frank gephart ?
there may be a chance our appeal is finding traction
with the seventh circuit .
they asked for additional material ,
and we &apos;re trying to supply it .
i don &apos;t want you to be disappointed .
that &apos;s my business .
tell me everything , and i will deal with my disappointment .
i don &apos;t care if a horse tranquilizer is just as effective
as sodium thiopental .
the law doesn &apos;t allow ...
counselor , watch your tone and your sarcasm .
yes , my apologies , your honor .
the law doesn &apos;t allow
for a shell game on lethal injection .
and switching drugs
is the very essence
of cruel and unusual punishment .
mr. cowan , i understand you ...
please stand .
i understand the state has an interest
in making its execution date ,
but why can &apos;t the state order more of this drug ?
hospira is a publicly @-@ traded company , your honor ,
and the only manufacturer of sodium thiopental in the country .
they &apos;re backlogged on orders ...
no , they &apos;re concerned their drugs are being used in this manner ...
mr. gardner , your passion is noted , and it is dismissed .
please ... stop .
the important thing to note ,
your honor , is that the replacement barbiturate
is just as effective ,
and that mr. gardner is merely attempting to stall an execution that
over ten years , has resisted every appeal .
be that as it may ,
you have other options open to you , don &apos;t you , counselor ?
if you want your execution to proceed ,
then you must acquire more of this drug
from your neighboring states .
otherwise , the execution will be delayed until you do so .
yes , i &apos;m looking for the arson expert .
is this dr. todd grossman ?
well , do you know where he might have moved to ?
yeah , he testified in the carter wright trial .
so you don &apos;t know where he moved ?
are you sure ?
i just need one vial .
sodium thiopental .
in the next eight hours .
execution &apos;s at midnight .
hi . can i speak to dr. grossman , please ?
yeah .
uh , is this the arson expert ?
all right , and when do you expect him back ?
no . it &apos;s just that it &apos;s very important .
i understand .
we &apos;re having the same trouble .
no , california &apos;s too far .
thanks .
what ?
he &apos;s getting on a plane to florida .
his aide &apos;s gonna try and stop him before he boards .
i think i need to take a breath .
you know , you &apos;ve been different lately .
i &apos;ve been different ?
yeah .
it &apos;s prob ...
one second .
what about the olive ?
this tie is going to strobe .
and this one is ugly .
i &apos;m praying for you .
thanks .
life has been playing tricks on me lately ,
and i think it &apos;s best not to take it seriously .
is this about work , or is this about will ?
there &apos;s a man sitting somewhere 75 miles from here .
he knows that in nine hours , he &apos;ll be dead .
i can &apos;t get my head around that .
what does blake have on you ?
have on me ?
i don &apos;t think he has anything on me .
okay , i &apos;m gonna drink .
i didn &apos;t like my life before , so ...
i changed it .
you changed it ?
how did you change it ?
in ways that ... blake is trying to use against me .
are you in trouble ?
no .
were you in trouble ?
no .
it &apos;s just that when someone changes their life ,
it &apos;s usually because they &apos;re in trouble .
well , you &apos;ve changed your life .
hello ?
yeah ?
are you sure ?
what time ?
okay .
thanks .
she missed him .
he &apos;s on his way to florida , but he has to change at o &apos;hare .
you &apos;ll have to buy a ticket to get through security .
yup .
good talking to you .
hi .
bye .
i &apos;m late .
no , no .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you for coming .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s trying to stay strong .
i think seeing you , it &apos;ll be difficult , but , uh ...
it &apos;s 3 : 20 , ma &apos;am .
i know , warden , sir , but she just got here .
she rushed from avon .
yes , and i said i &apos;d extend visitation hoursby one hour , to 3 : 00 .
i &apos;m so sorry . i rushed .
it @-@ it ... it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s okay .
warden , please .
ma &apos;am , i live in a world of rules .
i don &apos;t try to cut corners .
i don &apos;t try to bend the truth .
i make an agreement , and i stick to it .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes .
no , ma &apos;am . it &apos;s not .
i was sympathetic , ma &apos;am .
ms. lockhart .
but then you took advantage of my sympathy ,
and used my phone call with the anesthetist to delay my protocol .
that &apos;s when i lost sympathy .
please . i &apos;m sorry .
it was my fault ,
not hers !
warden , please !
stay here .
what ?
stay here , and don &apos;t say a word .
you &apos;ll see a glimpse of him coming down that hall .
thank you .
warden hiatt .
sorry to interrupt you on your saturday , warden , but i need some help .
this is robert barkin at state .
yes , hello . you have an li tonight , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
we &apos;ve been slapped with a last @-@ minute injunction
because our sodium thiopental is three days out of date .
do you have any we can use ?
yeah , i probably do . it &apos;s just that , uh ,
i &apos;m spending the weekend with my daughter .
we &apos;re going camping .
i wouldn &apos;t ask if it weren &apos;t important .
i can send somebody to you .
no , they ...
they &apos;ll nev ... they won &apos;t make it in time .
uh ... i &apos;ll come to you .
you sure ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll head out now .
next weekend , baby .
welcome to the live televised democratic debate
for cook county state &apos;s attorney .
all passenger
and put them in the gray bins .
at this time , i &apos;ll like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding .
please remove all metal objects
and put them in the bins .
all laptops must be separated out of your baggage
and taken out of their cases .
can you raise your arms for me , please , ma &apos;am ?
at this time i would like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding .
step over here .
i pressed &quot; program &quot; and then &quot; record , &quot;
but nothing is happening .
grandma , let me .
grace .
i &apos;m an american born and raised in chicago .
i have deep roots in this city , in this country ,
and i am here because i feel chicago is in need of ...
i &apos;m wondering if i should call him back--
the clerk at the seventh circuit .
we &apos;ve only got an hour .
no , not yet .
we may have bought ourselves some time with this appeal on the anesthetic .
how are you doing ?
i hate this .
being powerless .
yeah .
he saw his daughter today .
carter did .
that &apos;s something .
that is more than something .
will ?
yeah .
could ... we talk sometime ?
we can talk anytime .
no , i mean ...
we need a moment .
just a moment when things don &apos;t seem so all over the place .
okay , that &apos;s probably not now .
no .
hi , mrs. florrick .
sorry , zach said i could use the bathroom .
sure .
i &apos;m zach &apos;s study partner nisa .
hi , nisa .
at this time i &apos;d like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding .
dr. grossman ?
um , do you have a minute , please ?
do i know you ?
i &apos;m working for the carter wright defense team .
i really need a minute of your time , please .
this is the final boarding call for flight 1893 to orlando ...
but the science has changed , sir ,
the arson science has changed .
yes , but the physics hasn &apos;t .
you see these &quot; v &quot; patterns on the wall ?
a fire typically burns up and out ,
and a &quot; v &quot; pattern indicates a point of origin
for a fire produced by accelerants , ergo arson .
yes , but this can also indicate
the presence of a knob and tube wiring burn @-@ off .
are you in the trade , miss ?
no , but i just read a paper
by a young clerk in the seventh circuit
about changes in arson science ,
especially when applied to structures
over 80 years old , as this apartment was .
well , certainly &quot; v &quot; patterns aren &apos;t always indicative
of a point of origin , but ...
you see these brown stains ?
they indicate accelerant in the hallway .
and i really must get on my plane .
no , sir .
look , these brown stains
are just as likely to come from flashover burns .
you know about the changes in arson science .
you know what i &apos;m saying is true .
no , i know what you &apos;re saying is possible , that &apos;s all .
yeah , and all carter wright needs is what &apos;s possible .
look , you said at the trial that you were 100 % positive
that these stains were proof of an accelerant .
now , if your opinion has changed ...
there are other people you can ask .
no , sir .
there are other experts you can get .
not in an hour and not with your authority .
i &apos;m sorry .
actually , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t help you .
you can help me .
you are responsible for carter wright being on death row .
it &apos;s your responsibility to correct that mistake .
you &apos;re not getting on a plane .
you &apos;re going to write an affidavit to that effect now .
you just need a moment to realize that this is the right thing to do .
why don &apos;t i give you that moment ?
thank you , mr. florrick .
good , i got that part . what time do we have ?
we &apos;ve got 20 minutes .
kalinda is rushing the affidavit .
we &apos;ve got the addendum here .
you just take care of the preamble .
got it .
i will phone him in a minute . tell him it &apos;s on its way .
are you phoning diane ?
yes , i &apos;m ... let me call you right back . you taking off ?
yeah , unless you got some floors that need sweeping .
mom , come in here .
they &apos;re talking about you .
mr. florrick , the question isn &apos;t about the past ;
it &apos;s about the future .
well , i &apos;m here to talk about policy .
i &apos;m here to talk about the future of chicago ,
so if you have any questions about policy ,
i @-@ i &apos;d be happy to answer them .
but isn &apos;t that hypocritical ?
i mean , you sell yourself as a happily married candidate .
so i ask you again , sir :
has your wife forgiven you for your infidelity ?
mom , are you coming ?
mr. florrick ?
sir ?
my marriage is none of your ...
mom !
... fucking business .
sir , are you aware of what you just said ?
yes , i am .
do you have any more questions ?
yep , it &apos;s me .
my dad swore on tv .
nothing ?
nope .
will said he &apos;d phone when they tell us the decision .
look , you get back to your life .
i &apos;ll wait .
no , this is my life .
that &apos;s will .
hello .
mrs.florrick ?
yes .
this is jason kerrigan with the seventh circuit court of appeals .
i have judge jerry glendon with a question for you .
do you have a minute ?
uh , yes , i do .
please hold .
get will .
why ?
it &apos;s judge glendon .
yeah , it &apos;s will .
judge glendon just phoned alicia .
he what ?
yeah , just now .
she &apos;s on the phone waiting for a question .
this is judge glendon .
who am i speaking to ?
alicia florrick , your honor .
thank you for taking my call .
you have a second ?
yes , um , of course i do .
it &apos;s just , um , i &apos;m a second @-@ year associate .
i just delivered the addendum-- actually ,
not even the addendum-- i delivered the first a ...
shut up , shut up . you .
i &apos;m sorry , this is the number i was given .
jason , am i supposed to be talking to somebody else ?
actually , i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
i can answer your questions .
kalinda , what &apos;s going on ?
shh , she &apos;s still on the phone with him .
i &apos;m reading the new affidavit
from this arson expert dr. grossman ,
and he seems to have left a window to this being ...
let &apos;s see ...
an accidental fire , yes , your honor .
he &apos;s asking if it was an accidental fire .
tell her to push for innocence .
and you talked to him today ?
dr. grossman ?
one of my associates did ...
... and
i talked to him , of course , after that .
so my question is this .
well , actually , you know what i &apos;m going to ask you , don &apos;t you ?
yes , i do , your honor .
he &apos;s innocent .
carter is innocent .
look , i can order a new trial ;
i can deal with the heat .
but why should i trust this doctor
if he so easily changed his mind ?
because he didn &apos;t so easily change his mind .
he changed his mind in the face of a man &apos;s innocence .
so much of what we do is uncertain , your honor .
so much of my day is working between right and wrong .
but this has to be right .
to do this to a man ...
it has to be right .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
good night .
you did good .
you did .
trust me .
got the paperwork from the court .
dad .
and just hours before his scheduled execution ,
seventh circuit judge
jerry glendon called for a stay of execution of wright .
it is expected that his case will be retried .
ten years ago , wright was convicted
of the first @-@ degree murder of his wife carolyn .
since that time , wright &apos;s execution
has resisted numerous appeals .
you see dad ?
i did .
he swore on tv .
i know .
it was cool .
congratulations , mrs. florrick .
zach told me about your appeal .
thank you .
i want to be a lawyer , too .
international law .
that sounds great .
i want to get an earring , mom .
no , i &apos;m serious .
just , just one ear .
where &apos;s grace ?
in her room .
