i &apos;m happy for you . i know you &apos;ve waited a long time .
i don &apos; t like it .
don &apos; t let people take advantage .
i &apos;m kidding , you old fuck . what &apos;s the matter with you ?
dr. kennedy ? it &apos;s dr. enloe . i have the results for the frozen section .
can we move this along ? i have a thyroid in or six at 10 : 30 .
based on the preliminary results and depending on the full report ...

yes , it &apos;s clean .
miles , you close .

fucking dom perignon for everybody in the skybox at the garden .

you &apos;re worried about what i give you . worry about what you give me .
blow me with your lectures .
kid , you wearing a wire ?
you crazy ?
pat him down .
he fucking touches me ...
then make it easy on us all . take them off . everything .
new york reopened the books , but they laid down a probationary period .
when i was coming up , this would never happen .
but too many are doing a simulcast .
yeah , maybe you , you fuck .
do me a favor and don &apos;t take it personally .
everything .
go fuck yourself .
before , i was breaking balls . now you &apos;re beginning to worry me .
i guess you could call that a dick .
you &apos;re going . that &apos;s all there is to it .
jason mangelli isn &apos;t going .
tony , you want to weigh in here ?
tony ?
what ?
the washington trip ?
you &apos;re gonna be on that bus tomorrow .
you &apos;re all packed and paid for and you &apos;re gonna learn .
we &apos;re going to fbi headquarters .
so ?
excuse me .
what did you do to this scarole ? it &apos;s delicious .
balsamic .
that &apos;s all they have at king &apos;s these days . balsamic , balsamic , balsamic .
my mother never heard of balsamic .
i gotta go . problems at work .
it &apos;s sunday dinner , tony .
i know . i gotta go . all right , hugh , see you later .
can i be excused too ?
no , you may not .
he &apos;s got homework to finish before the trip . go ahead , anthony .
that &apos;s a nice example he sets .
ma .
the man &apos;s got two speeds , moping or yelling , when he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s got an uncle sick with cancer .
they didn &apos;t speak for a year .
actually , if you must know , tony has been better .
we &apos;ve been seeing his therapist together .
what ?
he &apos;s no angelo stamfa , that &apos;s all .
what does that mean ?
angelo was dying to marry you .
stamfa &apos;s is a chain of drugstores .
he doesn &apos;t need therapy ? he prescribes his own pills ?
don &apos;t be so sensitive .
what &apos;s sensitive ? i gotta hear this stamfa shit again ?
all i was saying was ...
i know what you &apos;re saying .
hugh , bring your plate .
you are blowing this all out of proportion . we worry , that &apos;s all .
spare me your concern , all right ? spare me your attitude too .
did you forget ? dad &apos;s mall was zoned
residential until tony made a call .
bullshit .
oh , really ?
that contract at sparta high ? the other builders were too busy to bid ?
my heart bleeds . the waters don &apos;t part for you wherever you go ?
i earn it . you two get a free pass .
what &apos;s up ?
hey , tony .
anyway , $ 4 a pound .
who brought this in here ?
georgie . it &apos;s wacky , huh ?
you think it &apos;s a playroom back there ?
what ?
fucking toys . this is a business . that &apos;s an office .
they were selling them at rite aid .
what ? what did you say ?
i pay you a fucking salary !
carmela .
you sounded tense on the phone .
yeah , i ...
i wanted to make sure it was okay if i came alone .
i mean , because tony couldn &apos;t make it .
i love the artwork you have . those country scenes .
thank you .
that statue is not my favorite .
it &apos;s not like this when tony &apos;s here . you never give the silent treatment .
is that what you think ? i &apos;m giving you the silent treatment ?
you could tell me why you came today .
i &apos;m worried about my husband . the mood swings .
i thought when his mother died , maybe ...
but ... still half the time he doesn &apos;t even talk to me .
you &apos;ve seen him like that , that day he sat here like a wall .
i know he &apos;s your patient and i &apos;m the patient &apos;s wife ...
... but you try living with that , see how you feel .
i see .
oh , you do ?
for your information , i am not the only one .
tony isn &apos;t under the weather . he didn &apos;t feel like coming .
&quot; fuck that shit , &quot; he said .
usually happens when we touch on a nerve .
he was distressed about this young man &apos;s death in the garbage compactor .
see , he didn &apos;t say garbage compactor , did he ?
see ?
what do you believe ?
you know his job .
he reports to a strip club . who knows how he spends his days ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just frustrated .
tony has been out of sorts for so long and there &apos;s nothing i can do to help .
i think coming to therapy with him has stirred feelings in you ...
... that you would like to address .
oh , please . i &apos;m just emotional today .
i would like to help you , but as you pointed out , your husband &apos;s my patient .
i am not the one who needs mental help . i just needed to vent .
in case you change your mind ...
... here &apos;s the number of a colleague in livingston .
he was a teacher of mine .
that really won &apos;t be necessary , but thank you anyway .
thank you for your time .
you took these yourself ?
that &apos;s a village i lived in .
you could send them in to national geographic .
so i got back your complete surgical pathology and op reports .
i feel 100 % .
that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s possible though that there may be some malignant cells we didn &apos;t get .
when we operate ...
... we have to decide how much healthy tissue to cut around the tumor .
the margins weren &apos;t wide enough . we took a small sampling of the tumor .
when we got back the complete results , it showed nodal involvement .
don &apos;t blame yourself , doc . what do we do next ?
it &apos;s called amended surgery .
oh , jesus . cut me again ?
mrs. brody is here .
don &apos;t let me keep you .
i am kind of backed up .
let &apos;s schedule you for tuesday at 6 . we can admit and prep you monday .
any questions ?
when can he eat regular food again ?
i &apos;d guess two weeks .
let &apos;s fill out the consent forms . one less thing you have to deal with .
take all the time you need .
you say sign , i sign .
tell me to crap on the queen mary ...
... an hour later , they &apos;re hosing it down . i owe you everything .
how do i know what nodal involvement is ?
didn &apos;t you listen ? a whole issue of u. s. news on seniors and health .
&quot; take somebody to the doctor &apos;s , &quot; it said . somebody to ask questions .
you ask one dumb fucking question about my diet .
angie ?
carmela , hi .
what a surprise .
i didn &apos;t know you shopped over here .
they &apos;re running a special on lams . every penny counts .
how are you doing , angie , with pussy gone ?
i tell you , shopping for one is no picnic .
why don &apos;t you come for dinner ? it &apos;s just me and tony .
who knows ? maybe we &apos;ll get lucky and tony won &apos;t show .
that &apos;s cocoa &apos;s worst time of the day .
that dog is not a substitute .
that french poodle is all i got left of sal .
he disappears one day and i get a sick dog .
the vet says to put her down , but i want another operation .
with sal , there was nothing too good for that dog .
but where am i gonna come up with $ 1200 ?
tony helps out and i am so grateful . it covers the basics .
but anything extra , there &apos;s no way .
angie , i &apos;m sorry . that must be so tough .
anybody around here love the word &quot; jimmy choo shoes &quot; ?
no way .
oh , my gosh , they &apos;re gorgeous !
or would the lady prefer something in gold ?
say a nice , i don &apos;t know , whatever the fuck that is .
they &apos;re all yours . they &apos;re from next season . you can &apos;t even buy them yet .
what size are these ?
ten .
ten ? that &apos;s sasquatch size . i &apos;m a 81 / 2 .
fuck , fuck , fuck . where &apos;d i get 10 from ?
yeah , where ?
so now what happens ? i gotta give them all back ?
temporarily . i &apos;ll get you 81 / 2s tomorrow .
all of them ? you swear ?
more even .
since you been , you know , &quot; in , &quot; i just can &apos;t believe the stuff we get .
it &apos;s so great .
except for that paulie . fuck him and the coupe de ville he rode in on .
he &apos;s saying you &apos;re holding back again ?
like i &apos;m gonna give that prick a full share ? come here .
what do you say ?
i love you , baby .
oh , you fucking better .
you better .
i do .
you could &apos;ve called . now everything &apos;s cold .
that &apos;s why they invented microwaves . for inconsiderate husbands .
since we &apos;re alone , it &apos;d be nice to have dinner together .
don &apos;t bust my chops . i got a lot on my mind .
this is fucking delicious . really . is this the pecorino ?
right .
the hell with heating it up , it &apos;s good like this .
i &apos;m glad something brings you joy .
you &apos;re amazing , your cooking .
i &apos;m having lunch with our daughter &apos;s dean . you won &apos;t be joining me ?
all he wants is our money . we already shell out 40 grand a year .
it &apos;s well spent . she &apos;s really learning . if she passes us by ...
lf ? she did that when she was 14 .
isn &apos;t that what you want for your kids ?
no . i want them to be backwards and ignorant .
and i &apos;m gonna make sure of that by not going to lunch with some asshole .
fine , tony . don &apos;t go .
guess who i ran into at the supermarket today ?
angie bonpensiero .
really ?
how &apos;s she doing ?
her dog is sick .
what , that fluffy french cocoa piece of shit ? what &apos;s wrong with him ?
her . osteoporosis . angie needs money for an operation .
take it up with pussy .
if you can find the fuck , wherever the feds put him .
i &apos;d look in arizona . stake out all the t.g.i. friday &apos;s . he loves their wings .
he left angie holding the bag . and those fbi &quot; family values &quot; cocksuckers .
they let him go without his wife .
into the program ?
that &apos;s right . he ratted us out . me and you . that &apos;s where he is .
i don &apos;t want to hear about him or his cunt wife .
his what wife ?
okay , who was your oldest ?
easy . chuckie periccio &apos;s mother .
you had sex with beverly periccio ?
yeah . a whole summer &apos;s worth .
okay , my turn . who was your most famous ?
and bobby ditillio doesn &apos;t count . he &apos;s only famous in new jersey .
you know penn and teller , the magicians ?
you fucked them ?
penn . and i didn &apos;t fuck him , i gave him head .
which one is he ?
the big one .
they were playing ac and they &apos;re funny .
he followed me into the ladies &apos; room ...

the fbi . come on , dickhead , open up .
paulie , it &apos;s 2 in the morning .

yeah ?
sorry for the intrusion . put something on and come out .
you can &apos;t fucking do this !
i can &apos;t ? you must have not read up on the latest rules .
and put that piece away .
what &apos;s all this ?
the berezovsky brothers jacked a shipment from milan off pier 87 .
nice goods . my broad wears a size 10 .
patsy , pack up some of these shoes . you don &apos;t mind if i take my taste now ?
he &apos;s not taking those .
make yourselves comfortable . we &apos;ll just have a look around .
i &apos;ll still get more shoes , right ?
don &apos;t know . i have to pay for them .
this really sucks , christopher !
you see the shit i go through ?
motherfucker .
what ?
nothing .
leave it on . it &apos;s nice .
meadow ?
didn &apos;t you hear me knocking ?
i thought it was vanessa .
you don &apos;t answer the door when friends knock ?
they keep you from studying . my first class isn &apos;t until 2 .
i brought your laundry . i made ziti with the sweet sausage .
oh , i &apos;m so starved .
it reeks of cigarettes in here . are you smoking ?
caitlin .
i hope you &apos;re taking advantage of offers here . a boy handed this to me .
&quot; a seminar on the cia and the cultural cold war . &quot;
oh , this looks interesting .
it &apos;s basic , we &apos;re way past that .
i &apos;m reading barbara kingsolver .
i so wish i had time for fiction .
so how is the drama queen doing anyway ?
fine . can we not talk about this ?
lf you want me to leave , i will .
i have an hour before my lunch with dean ross .
lunch with the dean ?
can we not talk about this ?
mom !
his secretary called and invited me .
come on , what about ?
money , i &apos;m sure .
they probably want a donation .
how corrupt .
i wanted to make sure you &apos;re recovered from the noah thing .
i &apos;m worried it &apos;ll affect your grades .
you call losing a wonderful man because of dad , a &quot; thing &quot; ?
is that what happened ?
you kept seeing him long after that business with your father .
don &apos;t drag me into whatever bullshit accommodational pretense you &apos;ve got .
was that last night &apos;s reading assignment ?
all right .
let &apos;s hear it . what &apos;s your big theory about me and daddy ?
no way . i &apos;m not touching that .
fucking bitch !
uncle jun , what the hell are you doing ?
those marshals see you coming in here ?
because i need being remanded to a jail hospital like i need crabs .
there &apos;s no car out there . and i came up through the cellar like always .
where &apos;s bacala ? he &apos;s supposed to help .
i sent him to the drugstore for more pepto .
you &apos;re getting better . that &apos;s the important thing . you look better .
if you &apos;re gonna lie , tell me there &apos;s a broad in the car .
you want that , it &apos;s a phone call away .
still want this ?
i gotta get nutrition somehow .
kennedy says eat only what i can sip through a straw .
what &apos;s going on with you and ralphie cifaretto ?
you don &apos;t got enough on your plate ? worry about your own problems .
when can you eat real food ?
who knows ? kennedy &apos;s putting me under the knife again .
back up . more surgery ? shouldn &apos;t you get a second opinion ?
chemo ? forget it .
with kennedy , it &apos;s cut , zip , over and out . he has the hands of an angel .
don &apos;t forget his name .
i have to be impressed because his name &apos;s john kennedy ?
all the micks named their kids that after the guy got killed .
i loved that man . he was older than me and now look .
how many white castles did you have ?
i didn &apos;t , i swear .
i can smell them !
let me call cusamano . he knows doctors .
he sent silvio &apos;s mother to one . it can &apos;t hurt .
people come from the city see kennedy .
then we won &apos;t be fighting traffic .
come on , uncle jun , you know i &apos;m right .
all right , you set it up . you come with me .
to listen and ask questions .
good , good . i &apos;ll let you know , all right ? all right .
he thinks i need a second opinion .
he doesn &apos;t like that i &apos;m going back under the knife .
maybe there &apos;s something to that .
another expert . think on this .
anthony is a cunt @-@ hair away from owning all of northern jersey . i &apos;m that hair .
maybe he has something else on his mind besides my speedy recovery .
junior , all this cynicism , this can &apos;t be good for you .
you speak italian .
second generation .
really ? ross ?
rosetti .
a thousand years of a proud name undone at ellis island .
a paesan .
not far from you . new brunswick .
no , get out !
my success , i credit to the jersey public schools .
where did you go to college ?
rutgers .
i went to montclair state .
good school . your major ?
business administration .
to meadow soprano , a valuable addition to columbia .
really ?
absolutely .
i &apos;ve talked to her professors .
they say she does all her work and makes insightful contributions .
i am glad to hear you say that . i was worried about her adjusting .
let &apos;s not tell her . we don &apos;t want her overconfident .
she sleeps an awful lot .
they all do .
tony , what the hell ?
you know , driving over here , i was thinking about how to handle this .
been working on my anger lately , so i figure it &apos;s good if i quietly say ...
... any kind of problem you got , you come directly to me .
please . leave carmela the fuck out of it .
of course .
then i saw the cadillac .
the money i give you , you &apos;re driving a cadillac and you want more ?
shot the whole plan .
so remember this :
you see my wife , you talk about oven cleaner . anything else , come to me .
but think twice before you do .
think about your fat @-@ fuck husband and what he did to you . him , not me .
cocoa , please . cocoa , down !
hey , how are you ?
i &apos;m sorry , tony . just push her away .
she &apos;s all right . good girl , good girl .
she don &apos;t look sick .
it comes and goes .
your kids don &apos;t feel boxed in by the city ?
we &apos;re out all the time . felicia has us all into kayaking .
you do it together ?
yeah .
the kids love it . they &apos;re better at it than i am .
more wine ?
why not ?
remember i said i spend half my time with student affairs ?
this is how i spend the other half .
at lunch ?
development .
fancy word for fundraising .
new student center . we break ground in the fall .
see the marble wall by the entrance ?
yes .
that &apos;s where the donor names will go .
everybody who donates ?
the wall is reserved for those whose commitment begins at $ 50,000 .
it &apos;s what we felt you &apos;d be comfortable with .
based on your generosity to the verbum dei school .
you know what we gave to verbum dei ?
i &apos;m half @-@ embarrassed to say it , but it &apos;s my job .
all the information , including tax benefits , is in here .
i will have to talk to my husband .
fifty grand ? you gotta be kidding me .
he talked a lot about meadow having the best possible experience .
those jews are holding her hostage .
he &apos;s italian .
jews with better food .
they know from verbum we &apos;re big givers .
we gave 5 grand a year . that &apos;s a long way from 50 .
this is college , tony . five thousand is a slap in the face .
well , let them say no .
here .
it &apos;s around 5 grand .
run it through your household account . and that &apos;s it . not a penny more .
5 @-@ fu with cisplatin and doxorubicin . this is what i would recommend .
are you getting this ?
sort of . so the chemotherapy would be instead of the surgery ?
i can &apos;t guarantee it . we &apos;ll evaluate the results .
i could end up having the chemo , puking my guts out ...
... having the six hairs i have left fall out and still be cut .
it &apos;s possible .
with kennedy , you don &apos;t get these maybes .
but you gotta have surgery .
kennedy &apos;s a great surgeon .
can &apos;t you people agree ?
sure . convene a tumor board .
what &apos;s that ?
a meeting of the chief of oncology , pathologists and specialists ...
... who work together to reach a consensus .
then you hear what they have to say .
your uncle will not be present .
they &apos;ll pass their decision to you . what you do is still your decision .
and kennedy will be there ?
no surgeon would miss it .
not much to him , if you ask me .
oh , you mean he &apos;s not kennedy ?
you make life and death decisions because of a man &apos;s name ?
it &apos;s only sloan @-@ fucking @-@ kettering , best cancer hospital in the world .
excuse me .
let me ask you something about this jfk worship of yours .
what about hoffa and the teamsters ?
that was the brother .
dr. krakower ?
hi . thanks for calling me back . i was referred by a dr. melfi .
yes , i would . anytime that &apos;s good for you .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s fine . grove avenue , right . i gotta go . bye .
who was that ?
the paving guy . i &apos;m thinking of having the driveway redone .
you smoking ?
what is this , the third degree ?
this says &quot; with pulp . &quot;
you like it with pulp .
not this much . i like the one that says &quot; some pulp . &quot;
what the fuck was that for ?
i &apos;ll write you up a list .
hi . oh , honey , i missed you so much !
this is the longest we have ever been away from each other .
did you miss me ?
sure .
did somebody drop this ?
well ? how was it ?
good . they had playstation 2 in the hotel room .
and ?
that was the total of your trip to the nation &apos;s capital ?
i guess .
i &apos;m sorry . the orange juice is fine . whatever kind is fine .
fuck the orange juice .
i give up . what then ?
the money you give to angie and other widows you &apos;ve got on your payroll ...
it &apos;s a business expense !
but there &apos;s not enough to make sure your daughter is protected ?
i won &apos;t pay . i know too much about extortion .
big deal , he pats you down .
i could do that standing on my head . it &apos;s everything else .
he came to my apartment and embarrassed me in front of adriana .
i heard he strip @-@ searched you .
i &apos;m not kidding . he &apos;s a sick fuck . he was sniffing her panties .
what ?
you heard me .
i don &apos;t deny that paulie can be a little quirky . he always has .
you &apos;re moving up fast . why do you think that is ?
because i &apos;m your nephew ?
so be a big boy and suck it up .
the patient : soprano , corrado . male , caucasian , 72 years old .
presented with severe weight loss and early satiety .
he was scoped and a mass in the curvature of his stomach was detected .
a ct scan revealed no evidence of metastasis . kennedy was referred .
he recommended gastric resection for cure .
there were no surprises . i thought we had it .
i was told we had clean margins .
often , too little healthy tissue is taken around the site ...
... which leaves the possibility for a false negative .
you want the whole stomach ?
if there &apos;s a problem , we &apos;ll take it to the board . what do we do ?
he &apos;s high @-@ risk . his pressure fell below 60 for eight minutes .
incision &apos;s fresh . i can do it in half the time .
lf we don &apos;t do surgery , we do 5 @-@ fu .
which works how well ?
not very .
which is why we decided to go in .
what do i tell mehta ?
mehta ? sloan @-@ kettering mehta ?
your patient sought a second opinion .
forget it then . i don &apos;t need that shit looking over my shoulder .
i &apos;ll tell him . yes , i &apos;ll have him there . thanks .
don &apos;t sugarcoat it !
if you concentrate on your breathing , it &apos;ll be easier .
the girl said she &apos;d page dr. kennedy . where is he ?
twenty minutes and i &apos;ll be back .
you go too easy on him .
probably .
hey , if my nephew cubby wasn &apos;t dead , i &apos;d have a soft spot for him .
did you sniff that girl &apos;s panties ?
he told you that ? fucking baby !
you got to apologize .
i &apos;m not apologizing to him .
you were out of line . he &apos;s gonna marry the girl .
as of the wedding day , anything that touches her pussy is off @-@ limits .
think it &apos;s all up ?
soon enough there &apos;ll be more where that came from .
sounds like you were going at it in there .
my pain a source of entertainment ?
you see me laughing ? brought you a milk shake from 31 flavors .
it &apos;s your fault . i &apos;ve been throwing up all day since i started the chemo .
oh , right . i gave you cancer .
you don &apos;t know what this is like , anthony . i can &apos;t do it .
kennedy was right .
what &apos;s he gotta say ?
i can &apos;t get him . they won &apos;t put me through .
why not ?
i leave messages at the hospital and office . i sent him a box of cigars .
i couldn &apos;t get past reception .
he didn &apos;t call ?
do they even tell him ?
the machine says for an emergency , press 6 .
i press 6 . still no callback 24 hours later . he must be busy .
yeah , that must be it .
you got his number ?
three more weeks . three more fucking weeks .
answering machine .
what are you gonna do ? these doctors , it &apos;s not like on tv .
dr. kennedy , this is tony soprano , corrado &apos;s nephew .
my cell phone is 917 @-@ 555 @-@ 0157 .
call me back anytime day or night . it &apos;s important .
batter up .
bye .
now what ?
get in .
you &apos;re not even married yet , you &apos;re dipping into whores .
didn &apos;t cost me a quarter . i don &apos;t pay for it .
how &apos;d you find me ?
better be careful . if i can do it , so can your bride @-@ to @-@ be .
what is this ? some new rule about who i fuck ? you want more shoes ?
no . they don &apos;t fit her .
i don &apos;t know why i thought she was a size 10 .
i don &apos;t know either .
i &apos;m here to tell you one thing .
you go whining to the big man again about shit between us ...
... we &apos;ll have a problem , my friend .
you seen these ?
fuck is that ?
my godson got it for me . they &apos;re all over the place .
we gotta bring one into the club .
watch and learn , phil . watch and learn .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s me , tony . corrado &apos;s nephew .
you belong to this club ?
me ? no . i came here to see you .
you &apos;ll have to call my office .
you need a new secretary . you &apos;re not getting all your messages .

titanium . i use one . added 10 yards to my drives .
thanks , but i can &apos;t accept it .
for what you &apos;ve done for my uncle .
i already got one and mr. williams here , he don &apos;t play .

stupid fucking game .
what can i do with it ?
what is it , jack ?
he &apos;ll just be a minute !
i could use a little extra distance .
who couldn &apos;t ?
my uncle &apos;s not doing so well . bad reaction to the chemo .
that happens . there &apos;s nothing that i can do .
there are worse things that can happen to a person than cancer .
my uncle thinks he &apos;s gonna die .
you know how old people are with their superstitions .
he thinks it &apos;s because he went against you .
i was his surgeon , that &apos;s all .
you got a bee on your hat .
show that man the respect he deserves .
answer his phone calls .
cheryl , make sure mr. soprano is scheduled for ...
just remember it .
everybody &apos;s marriage has problems .
is he seeing another woman ?
you can make that plural . he sees other women .
i look the other way . i want to help him .
do you ? moments ago you used the word &quot; divorce . &quot;
i said i was considering divorce .
i may be overstepping my boundaries , but aren &apos;t you jewish ?
is that relevant ?
us catholics place a great deal of stock in the sanctity of the family .
and i &apos;m not sure that your people ...
i &apos;ve been married for 31 years .
well , then you know how difficult it can be .
he &apos;s a good man , he &apos;s a good father .
you said he &apos;s a depressed criminal ,
prone to anger , serially unfaithful .
is that your definition of a &quot; good man &quot; ?
i thought psychiatrists weren &apos;t judgmental .
patients want to be excused from their predicament ...
... because of events in their childhood .
that &apos;s what psychiatry has become in america .
visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade to witness the results .
what we say in here stays in here ?
by ethical code and by law .
his crimes ...
... they are organized crime .
the mafia ?
oh , jesus .
oh , so what ? so what ?
he betrays me every week with these whores .
probably the least of his misdeeds .
you can leave now or you can stay and hear what i have to say .
you &apos;ll charge the same .
i won &apos;t take your money .
that &apos;s a new one .
you must trust your initial impulse and consider leaving him .
you &apos;ll never be able to feel good .
you &apos;ll never be able to quell the feelings of guilt and shame ...
... as long as you &apos;re his accomplice .
you &apos;re wrong about the accomplice .
are you sure ?
all i do is make sure he &apos;s got clean clothes and dinner .
so &quot; enabler &quot; would be a more accurate job description than &quot; accomplice . &quot;
my apologies .
so you think i need to define my boundaries more clearly ...
... keep a certain distance , not internalize my ...
what did i just say ?
leave him .
take only the children , what &apos;s left of them , and go .
my priest said i should try and help him to be better .
how &apos;s that going ?
have you read crime and punishment ? dostoyevsky ?
it &apos;s not an easy read , it &apos;s about guilt and redemption .
and i think , were your husband to turn himself in , read this book ...
... reflect on his crimes for 7 years in his cell , he might be redeemed .
i would have to get a lawyer ...
... find an apartment , arrange for child support ...
you &apos;re not listening .
i &apos;m not charging you because i won &apos;t take blood money .
and you can &apos;t either .
one thing you can never say :
that you haven &apos;t been told .
i see .
you &apos;re right . i see .
you &apos;re poisoning me . i don &apos;t know how much more i can take .
you taking care of this young man ?
dr. kennedy !
how you doing ? i &apos;ve been busy . you all right ?
don &apos;t bullshit a bullshitter . will this work ? or should we operate ?
you got a top guy here .
him ?
i &apos;d see him if i needed to .
son of a bitch .
stay strong and keep fighting .
that &apos;s my home number . you start to feel punk , you call .
thanks .
i &apos;ll check on you wednesday . take care of this young fellow .
carm .
what ?
you sick ?
everybody else in this family sleeps all day , i thought i &apos;d try it .
you ...
... depressed ?
or what ?
i figure in the division of labor around here , that &apos;s your job .
because , you know , if you want to go to therapy on your own or something ...
i notice you been tense lately .
that &apos;s rich . you suggesting i go to a shrink .
i don &apos;t have the time .
i &apos;ll still go to yours , if you want .
you know best .
that dean called today .
well , that can &apos;t be good .
i told him to put us down for the 50,000 .
carmela , i gave you 5 .
maybe i could go another 5 . maybe 10 , but that &apos;s enough .
tony , you gotta do something nice for me today .
and this is what i want . you gotta do this .
all right , i &apos;ll go to 10 . that should be enough for them .
i already told him 50 .
50 g &apos;s ?
yes .
you look like you could use a night off from cooking .
