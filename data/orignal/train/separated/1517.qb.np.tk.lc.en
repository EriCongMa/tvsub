honey ?
did you remember to give alex
and luke their lunch money ?
ma &apos;am , yes , ma &apos;am .
what about the electrician ? did you give him a check ?
he &apos;s an electrician -- he &apos;ll charge us .
i &apos;m gonna be late for work , shecky .
yes , i paid him .
happy valentine &apos;s , by the way .
mm , no .
gross and sweaty from running .
so for later tonight ,
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking , valentine ?
i believe i am .
every valentine &apos;s day ,
claire and i look forward to some naughty role @-@ playing --
sexually adventurous cuckolder juliana
and clive bixby ,
speaker salesman by day , spy by night .
lover also by night
and sometimes during the day .
the speaker business , it -- it pretty much runs itself .
i just want to keep it really low @-@ key this year .
you know , simple .
yep .
on the other hand ,
we could have
a drink at that hotel bar we love .
go on .
and come straight home ...
put on our jammies ,
and fall asleep in front of the tv .
perfect .
looking forward to it already .
ew , but not those ones i hate ,
those red satin pajamas .
i don &apos;t even know where those are .
i know i &apos;ll get over it ,
but right now i hate anders and cooper .
our dear friends anders and cooper
got married last valentine &apos;s day ,
and we wanted to get them something really special .
we found this exquisite little painting ...
... of a winery in napa
that we all visited last year .
it was a ... bit pricey ,
but they &apos;re really judge @-@ y
and we knew they &apos;d love it .
the problem is , so did we .
thank you , carmelina .
oh , and here &apos;s s @-@ something you can ...
put in the other room .
that was hard .
so hard .
probably how lily &apos;s birth mother felt .
except we don &apos;t have nine
other paintings by five different painters .
oh , my god . mitch , cam .
oh , god , are we early ?
this is so not like us .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , no , no . the party &apos;s been canceled .
why ?
cooper &apos;s left me .
he &apos;s filing for divorce .
the marriage is over !
ohh , anders .
anders .
i thought we were in love .
you think you know the person sleeping in the next bedroom .
i &apos;ll get us some drinks .
so sad .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t have to be .
if it &apos;s really love ,
you do everything you need to do to get back
what you once had .
you &apos;re talking about the painting , right ?
of course i am &apos; cause we don &apos;t owe him that anymore .
go get it !
okay .
go get it .
you must have big plans today .
this is like your super bowl , right ?
i &apos;m sitting it out this year .
the whole holiday &apos;s gotten laughably commercial .
sounds like amy turned you down .
like a bed in a five @-@ star hotel .
i &apos;ll be drowning my sorrows
in a marathon of my new favorite true @-@ crime show ,
&quot; lethal ladies . &quot;
amy may have dumped me ,
but at least it wasn &apos;t off the lido deck
of a carnival cruise .
i know , sonia .
look who &apos;s back -- the sangria sisters .
i invited my sister to visit
so that we could fix our problems .
you know , sister things ,
like i never liked how she always borrowed my brush ,
or she never liked
how i stole her one chance to escape the village
and i left her there , taking care of my mother .
things like that .
jay , they delayed sonia &apos;s flight until tomorrow .
why don &apos;t we cancel our dinner reservation
and the three of us celebrate valentine &apos;s here ?
you don &apos;t have to do that for me , gloria .
i usually spend valentine &apos;s day
selling artificial flowers near the well in my village .
where do you people live , national geographic ?
i just feel so bad .
you have both shown me such kindness this week ,
and i repay you with bad weather over tampa .
no , this is better .
it gets crazy out there .
i &apos;m happy to avoid the fuss .
wouldn &apos;t have minded a little fuss .
maybe i &apos;ve been kind of feeling taken for granted lately .
i know only girls are
supposed to care about valentine &apos;s day , but --
ah , what am i crying about ?
we get paid more , so what the hell ?
cooper didn &apos;t even have the decency
to leave me in time to cancel the caterer .
i have 300 of this wasabi shrimp if you &apos;re hungry .
oh , no , thank you .
sardine rillettes , olive crostini --
what am i supposed to do with all of this ?
carmelina , that &apos;s for company .
oh , well , there &apos;s cam , so we should probably go .
oh , you were gone so long , i was afraid you &apos;d woken mother .
uh , m @-@ mother ?
didn &apos;t i mention ?
she &apos;s recuperating here , just had both hips replaced .
oh , that reminds me --
i should put on the security camera in her room .
did you get it ?
yes .
and guess where they keep the last @-@ minute wedding gifts ?
hint -- apparently you need your original hips
to keep a nightgown closed .
well , i &apos;m glad you stopped by .
i really needed this .
oh , cam , get in here .
oh , i have a little bit of a sniffle .
oh , come on .
what &apos;s this ?
uh , that is , um --
that &apos;s a wedding gift for you and cooper ,
but once we heard , we didn &apos;t think it was appropriate .
oh , are you kidding ?
there &apos;s no bad time for a gift .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s so late .
we just wanted to get you something
that you would really cherish .
pretty much the best gift we &apos;ve ever given anyone .
yeah , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a beautiful ...
cheese plate !
yes , i got that from the ...
whimsical phrasing .
are you sure you won &apos;t stay for one more ,
especially now since i &apos;ve got this
stylish cheese @-@ delivery system ?
just one , yeah .
great .
what happened ? !
obviously there were two gifts wrapped similarly ,
and my eyes were watering
from the thick fog of vaporub back there .
okay , well , we got nothing to lose now ,
so go back and get the painting .
you know who gave him that cheap thing ?
j &apos;marcus . she &apos;s got the first dollar she ever earned --
just go !
once sonia blew up my valentine &apos;s day ,
i could have sat around feeling sorry for myself .
instead , i had a little chuckle ,
and i got the dog a gift .
i know it &apos;s silly getting stella a present ...
so close to her birthday .
is she around ?
i think she &apos;s upstairs in the bath .
what ? i just gave her a bath this morning .
oh , you &apos;re talking about stella .
wait , you got the dog a gift ?
lot of attitude
for a guy whose date &apos;s a tub of
ice cream and a fuzzy robe .
you &apos;re spending valentine &apos;s day in a &quot; cathy &quot; cartoon .
hey , what &apos;s all this ?
i thought the three of us
were just gonna order something in .
no . i ruined your night enough .
i &apos;m cooking for you and gloria
so you can have a romantic evening alone .
sonia , you don &apos;t have to do this .
i want to .
it makes me so happy to prepare food for you .
maybe someday i &apos;ll be preparing it for a husband of my own .
thank you for not laughing and falling on the floor
like my mother does when i say such things .
you know , it being valentine &apos;s day and all , i , uh --
i got you a little something .
ooh , laundry ?
no .
here .
i can &apos;t .
come on ! open it .
here , see that &quot; s &quot; there ?
that &apos;s for &quot; sonia . &quot;
oh , jay , it &apos;s so beautiful .
i don &apos;t know what to ...
thank you !
when will i learn ?
i &apos;m catnip to sister @-@ in @-@ laws .
years ago , i was sitting next to dede &apos;s sister cece
at thanksgiving dinner ,
and i threw a little charm her way .
you know , flash the baby blues .
and before i know it ,
she &apos;s rubbing her size 12s up and down my shin .
dede caught her ,
went over the table at her .
it took me and her sister bebe to separate them .
hey , where are you ?
i &apos;ve been trying you for 15 minutes .
i know . we ran late .
and then the car wouldn &apos;t start ,
they said they &apos;re on their way , but who knows ?
i &apos;m all greasy .
oh , honey , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna make it .
don &apos;t be mad .
i am mad .
you were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago .
this is the one night we set aside for us .
i know , and i feel terrible ,
but listen , finish your drink , come on home .
maybe we &apos;ll have a romantic easter .
check , please .
i understand that your wife has had some car trouble .
i wonder how that could have happened ?
i must say , juliana ,
you &apos;re the last person i expected to see here tonight .
well , with any luck ,
you &apos;ll be the last person i do see tonight .
oh , my god .
phil , i &apos;ve had my eye on you for years .
i &apos;m just so happy
we &apos;re finally gonna get some alone time .
i &apos;m not scaring you , am i ?
quite the contrary .
most women who meet me
almost instantly ask for some alone time .
excuse me .
darn it !
my showing was pushed up tomorrow morning .
i @-@ i may have to make it an early one .
are you sure ?
&apos;cause you only have one night with me , tiger ,
and i &apos;m as flexible
as a government @-@ insured , zero @-@ down ,
variable @-@ rate mortgage .
who are you ?
what do you say we get out of here ?
what are you doing ?
run , run !
but we haven &apos;t even paid for this .
we &apos;re outlaws , baby . go , go !
that was such a rush !
you &apos;ve never stolen anything before ?
only the entire show
of my high @-@ school production of &quot; the wiz , &quot;
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s --
oh , glass elevator . should make for an exciting view .
it will for the people on the street .
oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t even hear them get on .
well , maybe it &apos;s time for an ear cleaning .
i don &apos;t know , you just sluiced them out pretty good .
i &apos;m getting kind of hot , phil .
天黑后勿进
what do you say we cool off a bit ?
aw , that would have been great , juliana .
too bad it &apos;s after ... dark .
sorceress .
you were right , juliana .
this cool night air is just the thing .
would the lady like my coat
so she doesn &apos;t catch a col--
does that mean what i think it does ?
water &apos;s a little chilly .
think you can come in here and help me warm it up ?
baby , they haven &apos;t built a pool i couldn &apos;t warm a little .
where &apos;s cam ?
uh , tinkling again .
nature calls so often ,
i think she has him on speed dial .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
the motion @-@ detector alarm in mother &apos;s room
in case she falls out of bed .
i turn it on during cocktails ,
when i tend to forget she &apos;s even there .
what &apos;s going on ? she all right ?
yeah , yeah , she &apos;s just tossing her leg a little bit .
oh , that kicky thing ?
she &apos;s either having her rockettes dream
or her catheter &apos;s out .
she &apos;s fine .
oh , we &apos;re out of ice !
the nightmare continues !
god .
hey , i got it .
okay , put it back .
i can &apos;t possibly have heard you correctly .
there is a box over there with a santangelo glass bowl
that they got us for our wedding .
we &apos;ll just say that the cheese plate was a little joke
and that the real present is in the other room .
hurry !
you know , your coming around today
reminded me that cooper and i got you a wedding gift .
you did ?
well , now , this is a surprise .
well , even though it doesn &apos;t say so on it ,
it &apos;s a fish ! congrats .
oh , my god ! plastic olive swords ?
carmelina , are you trying to be deported ? !
all right , i got it back .
what is that ?
this is anders &apos; wedding present to us .
he must have swapped it out
when he opened that monstrosity that he thinks we got him .
we &apos;re getting our painting back .
go .
me ?
no , no . you &apos;ve already done a recon of the room .
you need to do this .
okay , take it easy , &quot; mission impossible . &quot;
it &apos;s a bed and a couch , not a laser maze .
now get .
a little champagne , and dinner will be ready in 10 minutes .
ay , gracias !
oh , jay , thank you so much for my new bracelet .
you shouldn &apos;t have .
and speaking of jewlry and &quot; shouldn &apos;t haves , &quot;
i was feeling sorry for sonia ,
and i gave her a little trinket .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah , but now the poor kid &apos;s got the hots for me .
i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe i just don &apos;t know my own power .
i mean , you must get that sometimes .
don &apos;t be mad .
and don &apos;t be whatever that is , either .
she hugged me and wouldn &apos;t let go .
it &apos;s not that crazy .
this has happened before .
oh , yeah , that time
when dede &apos;s lonely sister grabbed your leg ?
not lonely . she &apos;s a forest ranger .
she can &apos;t be tied down .
look , before i shuffle back to my bell tower ,
let me just say i know the look .
ay , jay , please .
i &apos;m so sorry
that i didn &apos;t pay attention to you at all today .
and now you &apos;re all crazy .
gloria , i can &apos;t find the candlesticks !
ay , don &apos;t worry . i go help you !
gloria , are you all right ?
my ankle !
why is joe &apos;s toy here ?
oh , gee , you really twisted it , huh ?
all right , honey . let me get some ice on that .
i heard a crash . is everything okay ?
yeah , gloria turned her ankle .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s gonna make it down for dinner .
oh , no !
should i bring your food upstairs ?
no , she just wants to rest .
she told me to eat with you downstairs .
she doesn &apos;t want to make any --
... trouble .
that was the most exciting night of my life .
would it break the mood if i clapped a little ?
no , i will allow it .
ooh , look , they have the good q @-@ tips .
i &apos;m gonna steal us a bunch .
i &apos;m gonna miss juliana .
that lady knows where the bodies are buried .
oh , thanks , honey .
i know some years i miss the mark on valentine &apos;s day .
this year , i wanted to make sure --
she &apos;s just so adventurous and surprising .
it &apos;s like i was parched ,
and she quenched my thirst with a big goblet of &quot; wow . &quot;
well , we &apos;ll have to make sure your goblet doesn &apos;t get so low
before we fill her up again .
i don &apos;t know what that means , but anyway ,
i &apos;m kind of thinking maybe we &apos;ll just go home .
that showing really is early ,
and i need to be sharp .
are you sure ?
i thought you wanted to sleep here .
yeah , i got caught up
in the whole juliana moment .
hey , would you see if there &apos;s any sewing kits ?
i think we &apos;re out .
yeah .
something was off ,
but i couldn &apos;t quite put my finger on it .
claire , let &apos;s get a move on !
i &apos;m coming . i &apos;m coming . hang on .
well , look who &apos;s back .
yeah , well , i would have changed ,
but this is all i brought .
change ? when you &apos;re perfect ?
oh , that &apos;s so nice .
oh , my , god , look at that .
it really has gotten late , hasn &apos;t it ?
not for a lady
of the evening like yourself , juliana .
what &apos;s say we fog up that glass elevator again
and grab a nightcap in the bar ?
then i put my finger on it --
my husband &apos;s in love with another woman .
you like that , don &apos;t you ?
mmm , yeah .
poor gloria , though , huh ?
she &apos;ll be fine .
oh , you have a little something --
oh , i &apos;ll get it this time .
oh , excuse me .
oh , the soup is ready . i &apos;ll bring some for gloria .
i &apos;m not crazy , right ?
no . she &apos;s into you .
thank god you wandered down here when you did .
you see how she keeps sliding close to me ?
it &apos;s like eating on a boat .
it &apos;s so much worse than that .
it &apos;s straight out of &quot; lethal ladies . &quot;
look what i found in the trash .
pictures of me and gloria with gloria &apos;s head cut out ?
she literally wants mom out of the picture .
hold on , amigo .
is she infatuated with me ? - yes .
understandable , unavoidable .
but would she actually do something to her own --
what ? !
she just took a bottle out of her purse
and sprinkled it into mom &apos;s soup .
okay , that &apos;s enough of this dumb tv show for you .
we &apos;re talking about a perfectly believable obsession .
you &apos;re trying to make this into something that &apos;s --
here , manny .
that &apos;s for me ? what about jay ?
oh , it &apos;s too spicy for him .
i make another one just like yours for your mother .
eat it while it &apos;s hot . okay .
oh , my god .
she wants me out of the picture , too .
of course .
young woman meets a wealthy , older man .
who wants a kid in the way ?
that &apos;s the first airtight thing you &apos;ve said today .
but she &apos;s not a murderer
stella , no !
oh , that &apos;s nice . you &apos;d let me eat the soup .
just clean it up .
open your eyes , jay .
she wants you all to herself .
the red dress just like mom &apos;s ,
the toy she knew mom would trip on ,
the headless pictures ?
she &apos;s crazy !
you think i &apos;m crazy ?
this is what i did with the pictures .
i made this valentine for gloria .
the dress i borrowed from gloria
to go with your pretty necklace .
and the &quot; poison &quot; is guasca ,
a spice i brought from colombia .
and there &apos;s stella with the toy .
which she leaves all over the house .
there &apos;s been some misunderstanding here ,
but it would be so super
if you just wouldn &apos;t mention this to --
me ? !
as loud as these two are , the move like cats .
i heard everything on the baby monitor .
how can you say these things about my sister ?
i was just trying to be nice , jay .
i will call a cab and wait at the airport .
now i know what your family really thinks of me .
sonia , wait !
i have been working on fixing my relationship with sonia
the whole week ,
and because you think you &apos;re a sex machine ,
you have ruined everything .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll talk to her .
sonia , i &apos;m an idiot .
i jumped to some crazy conclusions today .
i mean , i could say it &apos;s because of valentine &apos;s
or , i don &apos;t know ,
me feeling a little neglected ,
but i know you could never --
kiss me .
yes , because you &apos;re my sister @-@ in @-@ law and , uh --
we hid it perfectly , jay !
sonia , wait !
we &apos;ve waited long enough !
one night with me , and you &apos;ll forget all about her .
she doesn &apos;t appreciate you .
i hear how you fight !
that &apos;s just how we talk .
give in to it , jay . we both--
oh , no .
i knew it !
how dare do you try to steal the life
that i stole from you ? !
let him go , gloria ! i love him !
never !
he &apos;s my husband , and i love him more !
ladies , ladies , stop .
w @-@ who are you ?
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m a friend of you son &apos;s .
oh , thank goodness .
i twisted my neck , and i need my pillow .
i &apos;m in agony .
yes , mother moving in was inconvenient ,
but what did he want me to do , just get rid of her ?
who does that ?
i mean , a ghoul , that &apos;s who .
oh , no !
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i was just reliving the moment
you told us about you and cooper .
you &apos;re so dear .
you know that , that fish i gave you and mitchell ?
that really wasn &apos;t the gift we picked out for you .
really ?
no , i was just being mean .
it &apos;s just that , when i saw that cheese plate , i just --
wait a minute . did--
did you give us that because cooper and i
talked about opening up a little cheese shop ?
yes ! why else ?
how sweet !
carmelina &apos;s probably halfway home with it ,
but i can make her walk back .
and this ...
this is for you .
we really were so happy for you .
oh , anders .
well , we should probably get going , but look who is up .
mother , where &apos;s your hat ?
look , anders gave us the bowl after all .
it &apos;s a good thing you couldn &apos;t get the painting .
we couldn &apos;t take it now .
well , enjoy the bowl .
it &apos;s about time you boys had something pretty in the house .
oh , you &apos;re fine .
i love you .
your husband &apos;s noticing another woman ,
there &apos;s only one thing to do --
step up your game .
i just can &apos;t wait to get in a hot bath
and soak this infected toenail .
it &apos;s much easier just to take the other bitch down .
well , i @-@ i like the sound of that bath .
i assume the tub will be ringed with scented candles ?
oh , well , i &apos;ve got candles . i got candles everywhere .
ever since my boyfriend stopped paying my bills ,
they turned off the electricity .
leaving us to generate our own electricity .
although , candles can be nice
if you &apos;re in the mood for , say , some dirty dancing .
oh , i hate that movie .
what ? !
there i must passionately disagree .
or was that your game all along ?
okay , if it &apos;s an argument you want , fine .
fine !
of course johnny &apos;s gonna fall for baby
because he &apos;s this big , dreamy country bumpkin
and she is the shiny , new thing .
but what happens when the movie is over ,
when he really gets to know her ?
two weeks out of the catskills , and it &apos;s ,
&quot; you wearing that again , baby ?
you borrow my razor again , baby ?
isn &apos;t two glasses enough , baby ? &quot;
trust me , he is no longer having the time of his life .
juliana .
juliana , wait .
no .
honestly , it is one minute to 12 : 00 , phil .
valentine &apos;s day is over .
not quite .
i can &apos;t see you anymore .
what ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this
because you &apos;re the most intoxicating woman
a man could ever meet .
but , by some cosmic miracle ,
there &apos;s a woman in that house
i still find as sexy and exciting
as the first day i met her .
i should probably let her know that more often than i do .
that &apos;s my bad .
but , point is ,
a guy like me gets that lucky ,
he quits while he &apos;s ahead .
it sounds to me like she &apos;s the lucky one .
goodbye , juliana .
where are you going ?
sorry . aren &apos;t -- aren &apos;t we --
don &apos;t , don &apos;t beg .
it &apos;s beneath you .
but i --
please , go . my wife will see you .
go ? go where ?
don &apos;t make this harder than it is .
okay .
juliana , no .
phil !
phil !
really ? !
you know , i don &apos;t know why you are so happy .
i &apos;ve tried the santangelo
in six different places .
and it just make me
hate everything in our house .
we &apos;re moving .
