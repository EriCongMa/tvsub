you slept with him ? girl , what is wrong with you ?
i think you &apos;re in a position to become the spokesperson
the foster community has been waiting for .
so you flunking out huh ?
yeah , i can &apos;t go back unless
i want to keep taking steroids and i don &apos;t .
what is that for ?
we used to have somebody come play happy hours .
why , you play ?
those people you almost killed , it was the fosters .
what do you think &apos;s gonna happen
if i arrest the only family he &apos;s got left ?
can we at least wait till after the funeral ?
either you coming with me , or you ain &apos;t never gonna see me again .
let &apos;s go .
she has what we call stage zero breast cancer .
so i &apos;ve been doing some research ,
and they just published this 20 @-@ year @-@ study
on women with what you have dcis ,
and the mortality rate for women who opted for mastectomy
was no less than the women who opted for radiation and lumpectomy .
uh , okay does that mean ?
it means that a lot of people are choosing really extreme measures
when they don &apos;t have to .
in fact there are some doctors here
who recommend active surveillance over any kind of surgery .
you mean like , doing nothing ?
no , no , you keep a close eye on things ,
you have your mammogram and your mris twice a year .
well that &apos;s not exactly an option that dr. kopack offered .
i think the point is
that a lot of people hear the word cancer and they can overreact .
you know this is not an emergency situation .
i just i think i &apos;m just feeling a little overwhelmed .
i just i can &apos;t talk about this right now .
if that &apos;s okay ?
we can talk about it whenever you &apos;re ready .
okay .
i just , you &apos;re not alone in this .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry , i just i think i feel
a little ...
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not trying to push you away .
i know . it &apos;s really okay .
&quot; lexi for prexi &quot; really ?
what are we , in the sixth grade ?
she &apos;s never even been interested in student government ,
she just wants to win this stupid popularity contest .
she &apos;s supposed to be my best friend .
i feel like taylor swift when katy perry stabbed her in the back .
what ?
except in my case , lexi didn &apos;t just poach my back of dancer ,
she stole my music too .
talk about bad blood .
but you know what ? it &apos;s on .
well thanks for the sympathetic ear .
really appreciate it .
hey , are you busy ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m kinda practicing .
it &apos;s late .
yeah . i wanna get in at least
four hours a day before my juilliard audition .
and now that i &apos;m working at the smokehouse ,
this is the only time i &apos;ve got , so ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
did you ever tell anyone about
what we did in idyllwild ?
no .
why ?
did you ?
all right , here we go .
dig in .
so , it &apos;s not real sausage ?
it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s soyrizo .
it &apos;s just never had a face .
and can i just say how awesome it is
to have some fellow vegans in the house .
that &apos;s me !
vegan and loving it .
well you guys know , every vegan saves over 100 animals a year .
i &apos;m not gonna lie ,
i miss bacon .
&quot; love goes towards love as school boys from their books ,
but love from love , toward school with heavy looks . &quot;
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means being apart from the one you love is hard .
yeah , tell me about it .
good morning everyone .
good morning .
thank you for making breakfast .
look at that .
it &apos;s vegan sausage .
oh , that looks good .
what is this thing ?
hey mama , do i have to take shakespeare ?
yes , it &apos;s a requirement .
just like your senior projects .
have you guys given any thought to what you &apos;re gonna do ?
but doesn &apos;t my audition juilliard count ?
sorry , doesn &apos;t work like that .
i &apos;m thinking about doing a photo essay on ...
something .
on something . okay .
well , you guys better figure it out quickly .
and also you need to get a move on
because i have a dentist appointment .
you &apos;re all riding with brandon this morning .
you actually expect all of us to fit in that sardine can ?
you could walk ?
or we could drive ourselves if anyone around here
had the time to help us log our permit hours .
okay , enough , enough .
you guys get going , please , get going .
hey mariana , feel free to clear your pla ...
oh , my god .
oh , i need money for a new wrestling uniform
cause i d fit in the old one anymore .
uh , jesus ,
you &apos;re , um ...
not gonna be wrestling this year .
what what , why ?
because your actions at flintwood have to have consequences .
i thought the consequence was not getting to go back there ?
you gave into peer pressure ,
and you made some really bad decisions .
yeah , but i stopped taking the steroids
and i told you guys .
well , this is not up for discussion .
and feel fre clear your plate either .
are you sure that &apos;s good parenting ?
or , let me rephrase that question .
do you think it &apos;s a good idea to take away from him
something that he really loves ,
which also helps him get that testosterone out ?
mom , it &apos;s not a consequence if it &apos;s not something that he loves .
okay .
i &apos;m just gonna mind my own business .
i just wanna tell you
that i &apos;m not in any rush to go on my trip .
so i &apos;m gonna stay here
and see you through the mastectomy and recovery .
and i wanna be here for as long as i can be helpful .
sharon , we don &apos;t know that she &apos;s having a mastectomy .
she has cancer .
she has a pre @-@ cancerous condition that may not turn into cancer .
all right , well , you know what ?
when the doctor told me i had pre @-@ cancerous cells in my uterus
i didn &apos;t mess around ... i got a hysterectomy like that !
okay , well , there are studies now
that are saying that most hysterectomies are probably unnecessary .
you know , they have a different study every five minutes .
i mean , at first they say that
&quot; oh red wine is the fountain of youth . &quot;
and the next it &apos;s , &quot; oh , it &apos;s liquid death . &quot;
come on , stefanie , look ,
when you have cancer , you just cut it out .
i really think we need to be proactive here .
okay i think we need to take our time and make an informed decision .
and i think that you should go on your vacation , mom .
have fun , yeah ?
i &apos;m not gonna have any fun till i know what the plan is .
so , until then ...
we were wondering if we could pull the rv into your driveway ?
oh , yeah , we need to borrow some electricity .
not quite off the grid yet , will ?
i &apos;m looking into solar panels .
oh , hey , i got something for you .
what &apos;s this ?
cannabis oil .
high in antioxidants , being used to ease cancers ,
among other things .
i take a drop under my tongue every morning .
do you ?
yeah .
it can also be vaporized or use it as a suppository .
i &apos;ve been putting it on my elbows for my psoriasis ,
and look , it &apos;s just smooth as a baby &apos;s butt .
i am a cop .
you do remember that , right , mom ?
我请了病假
i &apos;ll be right back .
you puke or something ?
huh ? oh , no , no . i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just taking a personal day .
you all right ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
so , what time is the funeral tomorrow ?
three .
i &apos;ll take ty in after ?
yup .
okay , i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
真的很抱歉
you see this guy ?
hey , you nearly took my door off .
sorry , dude , i didn &apos;t see you ...
oh , damn .
how many clowns you got in that car ?
excuse me ?
jesus , settle .
hi , i &apos;m mariana foster .
you must be new here ?
yeah , i &apos;m nick .
what year are you in ?
junior .
i &apos;m a junior , too.i &apos;m running for class president .
i &apos;d love your vote .
welcome to anchor beach .
come on .
need a hand ?
uh , sure .
thanks , superhot .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
oh , hey , i was , um , i was just ...
helping her with the poster .
lexi for prexi ?
oh , and i suppose you &apos;re just helping , too ?
cupcakes ? seriously ?
yeah , and it &apos;s my job .
i &apos;m lexi &apos;s campaign manager .
heard you were back .
that &apos;s too bad .
can i have one ?
no !
okay , then .
well , hey , can i get your keys ?
i &apos;m gonna go to girls united at lunch to talk to daphne .
i don &apos;t understand why you told her in the first place .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i just needed somebody to talk to .
you think i don &apos;t wish i had someone to talk to ?
you know , that &apos;s how secrets stop being secret , callie .
when you tell people .
come here .
what are you doing ?
you know my history with hayley .
she totally stole my dance routine .
dance routine ?
mariana , emma stole my boyfriend .
uh , you do know that hayley stole jesus , too , right ?
yeah , from emma ,
which puts hayley and me on the same team .
look , my old friends weren &apos;t there for me ,
so i had to make new ones .
you know what , lexi ?
this election isn &apos;t popularity contest .
it &apos;s about ideas .
i have ideas .
oh , really , like what ?
hey , lexi , love your plan to install composting bins in the quad .
thanks , sally , i just hate seeing all that waste ,
just like go to waste , you know ?
totally .
hey , mariana .
hi , sally .
that was my idea .
was it ?
i better get to class .
lexi stole our composting idea .
and our student body president practically endorsed her just now .
you want sally benton &apos;s endorsement ?
we just have to show her
who has the real ideas , so ...
we challenge lexi to a debate .
and then it just disappeared ?
yeah , i guess whoever put the comment up must have taken it down .
maybe it was brooke messing with you ?
she &apos;s in juvie , how would she even get to a computer ?
maybe she made her freaky boyfriend do it ?
tell brandon i didn &apos;t tell nobody about you two at idyllwild ,
so he can stop being mad at me .
how is it with you and him ?
i mean , it &apos;s hard .
but , um ...
you know , we &apos;re friends first , so , at least we &apos;re in it together .
i think i &apos;m going to this comic convention thing with a.j.
oh , yeah ?
you back in the saddle with him ?
no !
stop . it &apos;s not , like , a &quot; date &quot; date .
it &apos;s just a ...
a good idea ?
&apos;cause he is fine .
shush !
his grandma just died , so ...
that &apos;s too bad .
i tried to text him to see if he wanted me to come to the funeral ,
but , um , he didn &apos;t answer . i hope he &apos;s okay .
maybe he just needs some time , you know ?
i mean , do you have any idea what it &apos;s like
trying to get over someone when you have to see them every day ?
yeah . that must be hard .
and now she &apos;s running for junior class president ,
and her picture &apos;s plastered everywhere ,
so i can &apos;t get away from her .
at least you don &apos;t have to live with her .
what ?
look , if you &apos;re this hung up on her , just ...
get back together with her .
i mean , it &apos;s not like there &apos;s
some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart .
i just wish i have something else that i could think about , you know ?
hey , what about our senior project ?
maybe we could do something together ?
you know what i need ?
i need to meet someone new .
i need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around .
you know what i mean ?
hello ?
uh , yeah , i do .
i &apos;ll be right back .
are you gonna finish that ?
so , what else is going on with fost and found ?
is that lady really gonna put all that money into it ?
justina ? yeah , i think so .
she wants me to do a photoshoot next weekend .
a photoshoot ?
damn .
no , not like that .
it &apos;s probably gonna just be like her and her phone .
it &apos;s low @-@ key .
she &apos;s really , really pushing this whole role model thing .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
nothing . i guess .
hey , i just thought of something .
what if the person who posted that comment was talking about liam ?
so , are you , like , stalking me now ?
what are you doing here ?
oh , my school is just around there .
oh , right .
yeah . heh .
so , is this , like , your spot ?
yeah . best break in san diego .
you ever get out on the water .
me ? oh , no , no .
too busy , and ... lame .
you go to school on the beach and you don &apos;t surf ?
yeah .
you are lame .
yeah .
if you ever wanna , you know , learn ,
i could teach you a few things .
okay . yeah .
so , maybe sometime that ... that &apos;d be ... rad .
you know surfers don &apos;t really talk like that , right ?
yeah , no , no , i know , i ...
i &apos;m just teasing .
yeah , that would be rad .
all right .
so , i &apos;ll see you at work ?
okay .
hey , you hungry ?
will made some tempeh sliders .
i ... i &apos;m not really hungry .
i don &apos;t wanna ruin dinner .
good thinking .
so , how you holding up , honey ?
i &apos;m fine .
you know , when frank and i were first married he was in the navy ,
and we did that long distance thing for three years .
how was that like ?
it sucked .
but when he did get a leave ,
and we had a few days together ,
it just made them all the more precious .
and our feet barely on the floor , if you know what i mean .
but not that i &apos;m encouraging that kind of thing ,
i know , grandma .
you know , i ... well , okay .
i mean , my point is that sometimes the distance
actually does make the heart grow fonder .
pigweed .
huh ? what ?
i was ouging and i found pigweed growing
right out there in the backyard .
really ?
yeah .
try this .
oh , thanks .
good ?
that &apos;s ... awesome .
anyway , what i &apos;m saying is that it &apos;s best just to focus on
how nice it &apos;s going to be when you do see connor
as opposed to how bad it feels when you don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll try . thanks , grandma .
you bet .
well , it &apos;s nice to see that
somebody around here appreciates my advice .
as opposed to my daughter who you know
if i say orange , she says tangerine .
you know , when she was little
i could ever get her to do anything i really wanted her to do
i was saying &quot; oh , don &apos;t do that . &quot;
did that work ?
every time .
do you actually think someone would be that cruel
to ask if you had sex with liam ?
he wasn &apos;t convicted of rape ,
and i &apos;m sure there are people out there
who are gonna think whatever they &apos;re gonna think .
and he was my foster brother , so ...
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
they &apos;re probably talking about liam .
guess i should feel relieved .
no , you shouldn &apos;t . it &apos;s sick .
of course , i did have sex with a foster brother .
callie , don &apos;t .
what , i did .
and what if somebody does find out ?
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong , okay ?
we really thought you were never getting adopted ...
we never thought you were gonna get adopted .
are we just telling ourselves that ?
i mean , i have this huge secret .
how am i supposed to let people think
that i &apos;m some kind of role model ?
because you are .
you are .
callie , you survived the system ,
and you helped a lot of people .
i think you &apos;re just afraid ...
to be more than the poor foster girl
with the sad story and the hard life .
but that &apos;s not who you are anymore .
you have the chance to be so much more .
to be happy .
and to go out and shine in the world .
the only thing holding you back is you .
and you &apos;re holding me back too .
i &apos;m sorry , i thought we were in this together .
we can &apos;t be in this together .
not if we want to move on .
yeah , come in .
hi .
hi , ma .
i just wanted to tell you that , uh ...
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
after a lot of consideration ,
i &apos;ve decided that it &apos;s really ,
really not a good idea to have the mastectomy .
okay . thanks for the update .
i do think that you should have the lumpectomy ,
as well as looking into other therapies along with the cannabis oil .
like , um , you know , acupuncture ,
and the white light meditation ,
and the art of positive thinking .
but i definitely don &apos;t think
that you should do anything prophylactic .
i don &apos;t think so .
got it .
thanks , mom .
okay .
i love you .
i love you , too .
well , that was a 180 .
maybe she &apos;s read the research ?
did you read any of the articles that i sent you ?
no , but i will .
i will . i just really want to get this thing with ty over with .
after we arrest him tomorrow ,
i &apos;m gonna make a decision about what i &apos;m gonna do .
which we will talk about ,
together . i promise . okay ?
should we wait a bit longer ?
uh , no , i don &apos;t think they &apos;re coming .
we should probably get started then .
okay .
where &apos;d you get the board ?
uh , it &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
that your brother &apos;s wetsuit , too ?
no .
no , it &apos;s ...
what , you make fun of all your students ?
just the most promising ones .
you ready ?
are you sure there &apos;s not , like , a second best break in san diego ?
one that &apos;s , like , smaller ?
relax . you &apos;re just gonna practice on the shore breaks .
come on .
where are they , mike ?
i thought they &apos;d show up for their grandmother &apos;s funeral .
look , stef , i swear i didn &apos;t tip off a.j.
maybe ty got spooked ,
when you brought olsen back in for questioning again .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i know you &apos;re angry ,
it was my idea to wait till after the funeral ,
so go head , let me have it .
we &apos;ll just have to find them .
that &apos;s it ?
could be worse , i could have cancer .
that &apos;s not funny .
no , it &apos;s not .
yeah
is something going on ?
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i just ... i have , they call it stage zero breast cancer .
what ?
what does that mean , stage zero ?
it means that i don &apos;t have it ...
yet .
but , i could get it .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just kinda confusing .
well , so ...
what are you supposed to do ?
well , i could get a lutomy and have radiation ,
or i could have a mastectomy .
what do you want to do ?
you know me .
i really don &apos;t want to sit around waiting and wondering .
i would rather just , uh ...
just get a mastectomy and not have to worry about it .
sorry , stef .
now i can get that boob job i &apos;ve always wanted .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;ve got great boobs .
eh , you haven &apos;t seen &apos; em lately .
is it just get awkward ?
yeah , it sure did .
i &apos;ll see you later .
not only am i well aware of our current parking lot crisis ,
but i &apos;m already in talks
with the vice principal to find overflow spaces
for all of our new students .
how do we know that you &apos;ll be able
竞选高三班长
to follow through on all these promises of yours
when the vice principal is your own mother ?
well , last year i led the entire sophomore class on a walkout
竞选高三班长
to protest against the firing of one of our favorite teachers ,
and my mother re @-@ hired him .
or , i &apos;m sorry , were you not there for that ?
mariana ,
what &apos;s your position on prescription drugs
being sold to students at anchor beach ?
um , well , obviously , i mean , i &apos;m against it .
it &apos;s definitely something that we should combat .
lexi ,
what &apos;s your stance on having free condoms in the bathrooms ?
well , i , um ...
safe sex is important ,
and we obviously want to prevent pregnancy ,
so ...
at the time , or the morning after ?
well , i can say as your junior class president ,
i can be trusted .
trusted ?
how can you trust someone
who stabs their best friend in the back ?
i did not stab you in the back .
please , you are just running against me
because you &apos;re jealous i &apos;m not living in your shadow anymore .
jealous of you ? get real .
okay , i think we need to get back on topic here .
okay , and you &apos;re the one that stabbed me in the back .
wait , how did i stab you in the back ?
you know what , just shut up .
no , you shut up !
you shut up !
i think this debate is over .
you all right ?
anything broken ?
just my pride .
just my pride .
come on , you &apos;re doing great .
i was way worse than you my first time out .
really ?
no .
but still , you &apos;ll get it .
here , why don &apos;t we catch you this whitewater ?
all right , this one &apos;s your wave .
all right , ready ? paddle , paddle , paddle !
go , go , go , go , go !
there she is .
what &apos;s all this for ?
your photoshoot .
sorry , um , i just ... i thought
it was just gonna be you and your phone or something .
oh , god no , i can &apos;t take a decent selfie .
callie . callie , you &apos;re not just an inspiration ,
you &apos;re an aspiration .
i mean , for foster kids everywhere .
i mean , if they can see it , they can be it .
so , let &apos;s show them all they can be .
okay , now , don &apos;t kill me ,
but i was at the mall today , shopping for myself , i swear ,
and i found a few things that would look great on you .
wouldn &apos;t this look amazing on you ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i love it .
that ... apparently is why i don &apos;t surf .
no , you were great .
it was your first time out . baby steps , right ?
here .
so , i &apos;ve completely blown my chances .
did you ... did you think this was a date ?
no . no , no , no , not like a &quot; date &quot; date .
i mean , did you not think that ... anything ?
well ...
okay . feeling like a complete idiot now .
no , no , i mean ...
it &apos;s definitely ...
um , i &apos;m just kind of getting out of something .
you know ?
yeah .
i do know , actually .
what &apos;s her name ?
i can &apos;t really talk about it .
oh , no , you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s more of a second &quot; non @-@ date &quot; date conversation .
you know , it &apos;s fine .
it was mutual .
we , uh ... and it wasn &apos;t because we didn &apos;t want to be together .
it was ... there was , um ...
these reasons that got in the way .
and we thought the main reason went away ,
so we finally ...
hooked up ?
yeah .
and then that reason came crashing back .
so , you &apos;re star @-@ crossed lovers ?
i guess you can say that .
what about you ?
did you really break up with someone ,
or are you just trying to let me down gently ?
no , i , um ,
i did , actually , recently have a breakup ,
but i &apos;m pretty much over it .
how &apos;d you do that ? any advice ?
i surf .
great .
it &apos;s where i work things out . it &apos;s in the water .
and then , when i get back to my life ,
all of a sudden , my problems
just don &apos;t seem so problematic anymore .
you must have something in your life that makes you feel that way ?
sometimes my music .
while there you go .
竞选高三班长
it &apos;s probably a sign , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry that got so ugly .
me too .
i know you &apos;re not jealous of me .
i kinda am , actually .
i mean , i had to go back to honduras
and you got to stay here .
i missed a whole year and
when i got back you were different .
more confident and prettier ,
and running class president .
i felt like everyone had forgotten about me .
i didn &apos;t forget you .
but you had new friends , like emma .
you know first she stole jesus , and then you ,
and now she &apos;s your best friend .
no , emma &apos;s not my best friend .
you &apos;re my best friend and you always will be .
no matter how much we change .
i don &apos;t even really wanna be junior class president .
you could always drop out .
well ...
i &apos;ve come this far .
circus left town without you , huh ?
yeah , i guess so .
you want a ride ?
thanks .
this is sick . it &apos;s yours ?
yeah , one of the few perks of being an only child .
i get 700 horse power all to myself .
yeah , but you don &apos;t actually get to use it though around here ?
dude , i took it up to 120 last weekend .
shut up .
where ?
oh my god , girl , you look amazing .
ooh , and you &apos;re totally smizing in this one .
smizing ?
smiling with your eyes .
what happened to you ?
she had a photoshoot for fost and found .
oh , so you &apos;re , like , america &apos;s top foster model now ?
hey , don &apos;t be a jerk . she looks gorgeous .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
you don &apos;t really look like you .
you don &apos;t get to do that .
what ?
you don &apos;t get to tell me to go out and shine in the world
and then make me feel bad .
no , i wasn &apos;t trying to ...
no , you hold me back , too , brandon .
it &apos;s not just on me .
no , you like me as the poor foster girl
who needs you to save her .
so , if you wanna move on , if you want me to move on ,
do not drag me back down .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . hey , cal ?
have you , um ...
you seen or heard from aj at all ?
no , he hasn &apos;t been answering any of my texts .
you ?
uh , he doesn &apos;t have his phone .
um , he , uh ... he took off .
why ?
don &apos;t know .
we think he &apos;s with his brother .
anyway , if you hear from him , you let me know .
yeah .
hey , listen .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , me too .
i know that you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do yet , but i ...
there are some things that
i think we should talk about as a couple .
like what ?
well , if ...
if you decide that
you need to do something as aggressive as a mastectomy ,
from what i &apos;m reading , after a surgery like that ,
a lot of women suffer from depression ,
and loss of self @-@ esteem , lack of sex drive .
mine or yours ?
what do you mean ?
you afraid you &apos;re not gonna be attracted to me anymore ?
no .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all .
okay .
honey , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s major surgery .
it &apos;s not like getting implants or something .
you might ... you might be ...
disfigured ?
you might not like the way you look .
and in most cases it requires multiple surgeries
over a long period of time .
it &apos;s not like they just cut them off and it &apos;s done with .
sorry .
no , i ... i know .
all i &apos;m saying is
why do something so drastic to your beautiful body
if you don &apos;t have to ?
* from forth the fatal loins of these two foes *
* a pair of star @-@ crossed lovers take their life *
* who &apos;s misadventure piteous overthrows *
* doth with their death *
* bury their parents &apos; strife *
that &apos;s all i got so far ,
but what do you think ?
a rock opera .
yeah , why not ?
well , shakespeare &apos;s pretty ... intense .
well , you know , we &apos;ll edit down the play ,
you know , to basic story points ,
and we &apos;ll make all the lyrics in modern english .
still , it sounds like a lot of work for a senior project .
well , it &apos;ll be fun .
come on . and this will give you a chance
to pour all that heartbreak into it .
you know , like a catharsis .
that &apos;s really why i thought of it .
thanks , man .

so that you would do the opposite like you always do .

on something that &apos;s so important !
