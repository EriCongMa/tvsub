that &apos;s right . it &apos;s your first day .
are you psyched to fight crime with your robot sidekick ?
am i ? the lead in my own tv series ? i &apos;ve dreamed about this for years !
why have i not been preparing ?
you &apos;re gonna be great .
but i gotta act with a robot . i know nothing about technology .
i can &apos;t even use chandler &apos;s computer , except to find porn .
and that &apos;s only because it &apos;s there when you turn it on .
our spat will start early this month.i &apos;ll be waiting .
the one where ross meets elizabeth &apos;s dad
are you judging them by their covers ? you &apos;re really not supposed to .
i &apos;m deciding which one to use . i &apos;m going to write another book .
because the last one was such a big seller ?
if you must know , i have written 14 books .
and as i &apos;m the only one who has read them ...
i can tell you that they have been well received .
but i lost all of them in the fire .
so this one i &apos;m gonna keep in an asbestos @-@ lined box far away from rachel .
who i forgive .
what are you doing later ?
rachel and i have to get our hair cut .
we do ?
i wanna see what he wants .
elizabeth &apos;s dad wants to meet me .
wait a minute . hold the phone .
you &apos;re not elizabeth &apos;s dad ?
that &apos;s the only one you get .
and he hates me .
he asked elizabeth why she &apos;d want to go out with a guy ... who couldn &apos;t get a girl his own age .
and what did she say to that ?
and that &apos;s yours .
come on . i really want this guy to like me.it would really help if you guys could make me look good .
of course we &apos;ll help .

i spent two years developing this . it &apos;s state of the art .
sorry . it doesn &apos;t look like it can do anything .
it can do this .
bruce willis
this is my father , paul stevens . dad , this is ross geller .
it &apos;s great to meet you , paul .
i prefer that liz &apos;s boyfriends address me as mr. stevens .
of course . mr. stevens .
so , ross ...
what &apos;s your problem ?
excuse me ? why can &apos;t you get a girlfriend your own age ?
it &apos;s funny ...
it &apos;s not funny .
i don &apos;t like you going out with my daughter , ross .
okay , i can see that .
i think if you give me one chance , i can change your mind .
okay .
what ? okay . i &apos;ll give you one chance to change my mind .
you &apos;ve got one minute .
daddy .
fine . two minutes . go .
a minute and 50 seconds .
i want you to know , i &apos;ve never done anything like this before .
i mean , i &apos;ve been in relationships in general .
but i &apos;ve never done it with a student . i mean , not ...
not &quot; it . &quot; we haven &apos;t done &quot; it . &quot;
i mean , we &apos;ve done stuff ...
okay . a joke . lighten the mood .
two guys go into a bar . one of them is irish .
i &apos;m irish .
and the irish guy wins the joke .

chandler .
never going to remember that .
you &apos;re elizabeth &apos;s dad ? i see where she gets her ...
rugged handsomeness .
is there a mrs. stevens ?
there &apos;s a mr. bing !
unfortunately , lizzie &apos;s mom passed away after she was born .
i raised her by myself .
i get that a lot .
why don &apos;t we all take a seat ?
i &apos;ll get us all some coffees .
yeah , why don &apos;t you ...
talk about whatever you want.whatever pops into your head .
me
it is strange seeing ross here , this time of day ... because usually he &apos;s at the children &apos;s hospital .
but not looking for dates .
monica is ross &apos;s sister .
he &apos;s a great brother ! i had a sister .
she passed away .
you don &apos;t have to do that every time .
but ross is a great guy . i was roommates with him in college.funny story ...
your roommate in college died , didn &apos;t he ?
a part of him did , yes .
here we are , paul , elizabeth.i hope you guys are finding something to talk about .
yes . we were just ..
sorry i &apos;m late .
but i am ready to talk you up .
when does liz &apos;s father get here ?
i &apos;m already here .
ross is so great !
hey , phoebe . how &apos;s the book writing going ?
really well . i &apos;m up to page 47 .
wow ! what are you writing ?
page numbers .
honey , you got the kind with the little girl.you said you &apos;d buy the kind with the baby .
you said the baby creeps you out .
the little girl does .
you said the baby .
why would a baby creep me out ? why would the little girl creep you out ?
can you please talk a little slower ? -this is for your book ?
it &apos;s about relationships.the traps , the pitfalls , what not to do .
keep going . this stuff &apos;s great .
excuse me .
and how none of it matters when the people really love each other .
and how people will believe anything as long as it &apos;s a compliment .
i left my keys here somewhere .
well , let &apos;s look for them .
hey , look ! are these them ?
no .
all right .
here they are .
good.-thanks for your help .
wait ! sorry !
mr. paul ?
just call me paul.paul.
i just wanted you to know that ... ross really is a great guy .
maybe you could date him . it &apos;d save me the trouble of killing him .
are you okay ? you don &apos;t look old enough to have a 20 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
well , we were very young when we had her.-we ?
it usually takes two people to ...
oh , no ! yes ! of course . i know that !
what i meant was are you still &quot; we &quot; or are you just you ?
i &apos;m just me.my wife died shortly after lizzie was born .
so you raised her all on your own ? yes , i did .
what are you writing there ?
i &apos;m drawing a picture of you .
well , that &apos;s very flattering.but it &apos;d be great if you could draw me with some clothes and a head .
how was your first day ?
pretty good . except i got attitude from the robot .
damn those robots . they &apos;re supposed to be our faithful servants !
it was the guy who controls the robot.he hates me .
he had c.h.e.e.s.e. knock over the sandwich table ... right when i was reaching for one .
why don &apos;t you get him fired ?
i may have to . i hate to do it . but i &apos;m the star , you know ?
there &apos;s a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor .
excuse me .
joey tribbiani .
joe ! i &apos;m glad i found you ! i got an audition for you .
but it &apos;s kind of on the q.t.
the actor who has the part doesn &apos;t know he might be fired .
it &apos;s the lead in a series.mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
i &apos;m the lead in mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
joey ?
hi , ross .
i was just getting him to like you .
joey !
ross , joey is not here .
i &apos;ll just wait for him in here !
ross , it &apos;s okay . you can come out .
yeah . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s me ... mr. stevens .
i didn &apos;t ... oh , my gosh . i didn &apos;t even see you .
you did . you came in , got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.you were shouting , &quot; joey ! &quot;
bye , rachel .
bye .
i &apos;ll call you later .
see you .
bye , ross .
what ? what the .. ? how did ... ? what ?
you know , he lost his keys . so he was looking for them .
in your mouth ?
no ! downstairs . and we got to talking ... for two hours . i liked him .
i invited him for coffee .
you were at the coffeehouse !
what &apos;s the big deal ? so i kissed the guy .
he is my girlfriend &apos;s father . it &apos;s weird !
you dated my sister !
that was different !
what ? why ?
this is weird for me !
ross , look . this is good for you .
let &apos;s face it . so far the guy &apos;s not loving you .
but i can turn that around . i &apos;ve got the inside track .
we could all go out to dinner . and i could talk you up .
plus the guy is a very successful lawyer .
how is that important ?
it &apos;s important !
there &apos;s a million guys who can play mac ...
and there &apos;s one robot.and this one guy who controls it .
i didn &apos;t know he could get me fired.what am i gonna do ?
you &apos;re a pretty charming guy .
thanks . but i have a problem to deal with .
no , you &apos;ve got to win over the guy who controls c.h.e.e.s.e.
go back there and kiss some serious robot ass !
that &apos;s not a bad idea !
if i have to be charming tomorrow , i &apos;m not wasting it on you guys .
i got some saved for you , phoebe .
do you think joey is more charming than me ?
yeah . that &apos;s why i &apos;m sleeping with him on the side .
you wish .
&quot; you wish . &quot;
stop writing about us.i &apos;m not writing about you . i &apos;m writing about other people .
who ?
marsha and chester .
fine . then you know what ? i will just write about phyllis .
&quot; phyllis is sitting in the chair . &quot;
i see what you &apos;re doing .
&quot; phyllis sees what i &apos;m doing . &quot;
i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter !
morning ! how &apos;s my favorite genius and his robot ?
don &apos;t touch him !
okay .
level with me .
i keep hearing rumors that i might get fired .
they even have actors reading for my part .
come on . you gotta give me a second chance .
i love this little guy .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t want me to touch him , right ?
i can &apos;t believe it . god !
hey , how are you doing ?
so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.so ross selflessly offered to take me .
what a nice story .
so ross was in college ... and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom .
i definitely did not see that one backfiring .
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
take your time .
i was a freshman and she was a senior . so it wasn &apos;t as bad as ..
look . i know i &apos;ve been giving you a lot of jabs .
it &apos;s partly because i &apos;m very protective of lizzie ...
and partly because they just keep coming to me .
i admit after all the wonderful things lizzie told me ... and the many , many , many stories that rachel has told me ...
well ... you &apos;re not ... all bad .
&quot; not all bad . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry i was so harsh . but you have to understand .
i still look at lizzie like she &apos;s a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
i know what you mean . i do that too .
i beg your pardon ?
i don &apos;t see her as a 12 @-@ year @-@ old .
i mean , i have a son who is 6 and i still think of him as a baby .
a son ?
my ex @-@ wife and i share custody of ben .
incidentally , carol and i are on excellent terms ... as i &apos;m sure you are with your wife .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s unbelievable !
don &apos;t worry . i didn &apos;t realize you were married .
we were . but that was just a ...
that was just a big drunken mistake .
you &apos;re back .
you two were married ?
i &apos;m sorry . you were talking about emily .
we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at 6 : 00 .
we said 7 : 00.we said 6 : 00 !
the only way that i said 6 : 00 ... would be if i said the sentence , &quot; let &apos;s meet at 7 : 00,
not at 6 : 00 . &quot;
if i had said 7 : 00 , i would have said :
&quot; my boyfriend is such a wiseass . 7 : 00 ! &quot;
hi ! -oh , my good god !
i know what time you said .
what ?
well , i know what time chester and marsha said .
what time ?
interesting turn of events.suddenly it &apos;s my book to the rescue . let &apos;s see
very interesting.well this certainly clears things up .
what does it say ?
i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book .
thank you for writing your book .
it &apos;s a great book ... and you are the queen of everything .
thanks . so are you .
i told you i should not wear this color .
&quot; monica .. marsha and chester are planning on seeing a movie sunday .
&quot; marsha thinks they &apos;re meeting at 6 : 00 . chester thinks it &apos;s 7 : 00 . &quot;
you knew we were gonna miss the movie ?
right .
instead of telling us , you decided to write it in your stupid book ?
&quot; marsha and chester are mad at phyllis . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna lose this job .
i &apos;m so sorry , man . is there anything i can do ?
help me get this mini @-@ fridge past the security guard .
joey , i want to talk to you .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
i hate you . you ruined my life .
chandler , wayne . wayne , chandler . -hi .
i &apos;ll get you your job back if you help me out .
why should i help you out ?
the reason he just said .
what do you need ?
i saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.you know , sarah .
i wish i could talk to her.-are you in love with her ?
yeah.her. all of them . anyone .
yeah . i &apos;ve been there , my friend .
listen , i guarantee you keep your job ... if you can teach me to talk to women like you do .
you can &apos;t teach it . it &apos;s something you &apos;re born with .
you can teach it . i can show you right now .
really ?
sure . yeah . i taught him .
yeah . you should see the woman i &apos;m with , way out of my league .
in fact , if you want , i can get you her .
well , if you think about it ... ross did learn something from each marriage .
how to make the next one even shorter ?
wait a minute . that &apos;s not fair .
he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to emily.he just didn &apos;t tell me .
maybe i have to pee again .
well , this is fun .
so , ross , did you kill any of these wives ?
i have had enough of this !
i care a great deal about your daughter.and i have treated her with respect !
so if you &apos;ve got a problem with me ..
are you yelling at me ?
god , no .
you know what ? if you don &apos;t like ross , that &apos;s fine .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m going out with him anyway .
really ?
well , if it doesn &apos;t matter to her ... it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
still not yelling .
what can i say ?
i still don &apos;t like you.i &apos;m not so crazy about myself right now either .
then we agree ?
i guess so .
neither of us like ross .
i like ross .
kids !
i just thought of a story about how nice ross is .
that &apos;s okay . we &apos;re not liking ross right now .
well , i got a lot of those too .
you were right , c.h.e.e.s.e.
the shipment never made it to omaha ?
you got it.and the rabbi &apos;s beard ? 100 percent horsehair .
nice catch , c.h.e.e.s.e.
it &apos;s your line , c.h.e.e.s.e.
