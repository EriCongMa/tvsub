gossip girl here
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i &apos;ve decided to take over bass industries .
there is one stipulation
that should you in any way
act inappropriately , the board has the option
to replace you with your legal guardian ,
which--wouldn &apos;t you know it ? is me .
i had enough trouble
with the idea of mom and rufus dating ,
but now i share a sibling with my boyfriend ?
maybe we weren &apos;t meant to be a family .
serena , dean berube .
i &apos;d like to issue a press release
that you came up to visit our glorious campus .
princeton is a trade school .
there is only yale .
he said that yale could really
use a girl like blair waldorf .
oh , b , i &apos;m so happy for you .
精校 : 玲珑爱小桃
第二季 第十六集
office of undergraduate admissions
true love and betrayal ,
true love and betrayal , revenge and more revenge ,
a heroine with an impossible goal--
if only mozart had lived on the upper east side .
blair bear , you &apos;ll be late !
but you can keep your magic flute , amadeus .
all this queen wants
is a golden ticket to yale .
you look like a firing squad .
more like a welcoming committee .
it &apos;s the big day .
it &apos;s all the color of yale . you see ?
that &apos;s just what i need to perk me up .
i couldn &apos;t sleep a wink .
we know . we heard you watching &quot; gilmore girls &quot;
all night , again .
oh . i am so a better fit for yale than that rory .
dorota .
don &apos;t be sad .
i &apos;m not going anywhere for six months .
that wasn &apos;t dorota , dear .
that was handsome dan .
look at him .
yeah , he &apos;s a gift from all of us .
oh ! he &apos;s the yale mascot , bulldog--
oh ! just like you after today .
i don &apos;t know about the name , though .
we should just call him &quot; handsome . &quot;
you &apos;re adorable .
yes , just don &apos;t look behind sofa .
now , you &apos;re a shoo @-@ in , darling .
mademoiselle .
merci .
a shoo @-@ in .
the personal letter that i wrote to dean berube
should simply cinch it .
we will celebrate your acceptance
tonight at the opera
with champagne at all intermissions .
we will be so drunk
by the time someone dies , we &apos;ll just laugh .
is chuck joining us ?
you know how he loves a good tragedy .
yes . where is mr. chuck ?
i wouldn &apos;t know , and i don &apos;t care .
he &apos;s as dead to me as his father is to him .
more blueberries .
whew ! yale day .
good morning .
i thought we could walk to school
together for support .
i keep telling myself
that everything happens for a reason .
you know , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll end up in the right place ,
but what if i don &apos;t get in ?
forget you .
what if i do and blair doesn &apos;t ?
fire and--and brimstone
and a lot of bitchy asides ,
death by dorota . thanks .
you don &apos;t have to worry either .
blair &apos;s a lock .
the dean told her as much , right ?
yeah. yeah , yale is good .
we &apos;re good .
everything will be fine .
you &apos;re referring to the recent not fun event ,
uh , also known as the &quot; you two share a brother ,
oh , wait . no , you don &apos;t roller coaster .
not to be outdone by the tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl
called &quot; discovering this fact has only served
to bringing rufus and lily closer than ever . &quot;
look , getting into yale will change our lives .
it &apos;ll give us a chance to reinvent ourselves .
yeah. yeah , and in the meantime ,
at least our parents
are keeping it on the down low .
yeah .
rufus , stop it .
oh , hello .
i was planning on sneaking out
before anyone got up ,
but lily and i got to bed so late .
oh , you don &apos;t @-@ you- that &apos;s @-@ just stop there .
right .
well , now that this is all out in the open ,
maybe we can stop sneaking around .
i mean , we &apos;ve had the awkward run @-@ in
and it isn &apos;t so bad .
i don &apos;t know why we thought
this would be so weird .
let &apos;s leave now .
nice try , mom .
yeah , seriously good effort .
so i was thinking , tonight--
more than four hours of sleep ?
that , and there is a charity gala at the opera .
a full 12 hours then .
oh , everyone will be there .
it &apos;s the--it &apos;s the event of the season ,
and i &apos;m really feeling ready
to get back to the world .
aren &apos;t you worried about people
seeing us together so soon ?
the kids know . why shouldn &apos;t the world ?
and , uh , we might as well
make our society debut in style .
i was just trying to get out of the opera part .
i &apos;m not a fan .
well , you can become one tonight .
i would say , &quot; get a room , &quot;
but yours is right above mine .
please try to remember that .
oh , my god .
no , i told you , under 18
and i want verification .
i don &apos;t care where you have to import them from .
i want them young and unstable .
you can cancel that order .
i already ate .
i &apos;ll get right back to you .
your bush league attempts to take me down--
they &apos;re getting boring .
although , i must admit ,
having the freshman class of brearley
hold their annual sleepover in my hotel room--
that was a nice touch .
by the way , don &apos;t be alarmed ,
but , uh , our stock might take a little dip today .
i &apos;m still adjusting to a learning curve .
no , what you &apos;re doing is trying too hard .
you &apos;re obviously not cut out for the job ,
which is why bart
never let you out of the outback .
you should be more careful .
or what ? it &apos;s my company now , kid .
you saw to that .
will the , uh , board and i will
be seeing you at the opera tonight ?
even though you &apos;re no longer in charge ,
you are still the public face of the company .
i think it &apos;s important you display it ,
show there &apos;s no hard feelings .
maybe i &apos;ll show them
they made the wrong choice instead .
oh , wait . you &apos;re already doing that for me ,
aren &apos;t you ?
no matter .
we probably won &apos;t be seeing
much of each other anyway .
i &apos;ll be in your father &apos;s seats ,
and you &apos;ll be , well , somewhere else .
there &apos;s a new kid .
that &quot; kid &quot; is my shakespeare teacher , miss carr .
that @-@ that &apos;s miss carr ?
does she have benjamin button syndrome ?
here . let us help you .
it &apos;s all right .
oh , thank you , serena . it &apos;s like holding a door
never occurred to anybody .
no , not on the upper east side .
these kids have probably
never touched a door in their life .
they just magically open for them , don &apos;t they ?
oh , uh , this is my boyfriend , dan humphrey .
dan , this is miss carr . she &apos;s my favorite new teacher .
well , i &apos;ve heard a lot about you ,
although i @-@ i wasn &apos;t expecting you to look so ...
out of place ?
no , i was gonna say &quot; young . &quot; you could pass for a student .
well , i was , until recently .
i &apos;ve been doing teach for america
the past two years in alabama .
this is my first salaried job .
i &apos;ve never even been to new york before .
it &apos;s a lot different than des moines .
my family is in the hotel business
and the palace lobby is a wonderful place
to get away from the noise .
yeah , and , you know , if you &apos;re ever in brooklyn ,
uh , my dad has a gallery . there &apos;s a pretty cool cafe .
brooklyn--that &apos;s , uh , the place across the bridge , right ?
ha ha. yeah. you &apos;ll fit in just fine here .
oh , hey , don &apos;t let the city get to you .
see you third period. mm @-@ hmm .
nice meeting you , daniel .
nice meeting you , miss carr .
so good luck today .
you , too . may the best get in .
refresh . refresh . refresh .
that &apos;s not my eli account .
no , it &apos;s mine .
i applied to yale , too , remember ?
yes , but your application was
merely a formality to appease your overbearing parents .
you know very well
there &apos;s no way yale is going to accept someone
who got a 2360 on her s.a.t.s ,
so give up and go for the gold , my gold .
refresh .
hey , are you going to the opera thing tonight ?
um , yeah . serena &apos;s taking me .
yeah ? i might go , too .
you know , for a while , i couldn &apos;t take vanessa
anywhere really nice , &apos; cause of the whole no money thing ,
but i saw a dvd of the &quot; ring &quot; cycle at her house ,
and i figured she might like some champagne
in my family &apos;s box .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
don &apos;t tell her you saw that dvd ,
though , &apos; cause i @-@ i pointed it out once ,
and she made me watch the whole thing with no subtitles .
if you &apos;ve ever seen &quot; a clockwork orange , &quot;
you know how that ended up .
wait . what &apos;s &quot; a clockwork orange &quot; ?
charles , i didn &apos;t expect to see you today .
or ever , if i had it my way .
yes , well , i missed you , too .
i &apos;m trying to do something .
i really wanted to do it on my own ,
but that &apos;s not working .
i &apos;m thinking you &apos;re the only person left who can help .
what do you say ?
what are you guys doing ?
shh . don &apos;t talk to them. they &apos;re working .
refresh .
my ...
god
what ? what is it ?
congratulations , serena van der woodsen !
you have been accepted .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i simply can &apos;t read it .
the font &apos;s too small .
i have to check it on a real computer .
it says &quot; wait @-@ listed &quot; in bold .
i got in . i did it . i got in . oh , my gosh !
i can &apos;t believe it . oh , did you ?
no. no , no. um , i &apos;m wait @-@ listed , just like blair .
well , don &apos;t worry. you &apos;ll get in .
we &apos;ll be together next fall . even if you have to wait
another couple of months to find out for sure ,
it &apos;s all good , or it will be .
yeah , i know it will .
i need to see the headmistress .
right now !
they say that it &apos;s not over till the fat lady sings .
but who &apos;s that i hear tuning up in the wings ?
sorry , b . i think it &apos;s curtains .
all my usual moves haven &apos;t worked . jack is blood .
he thinks too much like me , sees me coming .
and the way he &apos;s running the business ,
i worry everything my father had worked for will be lost .
since you &apos;re part of the company now ,
i thought you might care .
i do care , charles ,
but my concern is for you , not the company .
you &apos;re living alone. why don &apos;t you move back in here ?
it &apos;ll make it a lot easier to work together .
i &apos;m not interested in a family reunion
nor in assuaging your guilt
over my father &apos;s death .
do you believe in my cause or not ?
i do .
but your shenanigans-- planting coke in his gym bag ,
ambushing him with a transsexual hooker ...
two. they owed me a favor .
will only cast a negative light on you in the board &apos;s eyes .
i don &apos;t care about the board anymore .
you should . you need them .
so let me help you by handling this like a grownup .
my 20 % stake in bass industries
must count for something , and when i &apos;m done ,
perhaps you &apos;ll reconsider your living situation .
don &apos;t hold your breath .
meet me here at 2 : 00 ?
how did this happen ?
dean berube said i was a perfect fit .
his exact words were ,
&quot; yale could use a girl like blair waldorf . &quot;
well , apparently , they found one somewhere else .
calm yourself .
when i spoke to dean berube this morning ,
he assured me that if the student they &apos;ve accepted
turns them down , you are next in line .
dan humphrey ?
he &apos;s like a cafeteria lady who won the lottery .
you couldn &apos;t pry that acceptance from his hands
with the jaws of life .
i wasn &apos;t speaking about mr. humphrey .
someone from constance got in ?
blair , in our school &apos;s history , most wait @-@ listed students
ultimately get into the college of their choice .
your transcript is a series of unblemished a &apos;s .
all you have to do is keep up your g.p.a.
and you &apos;ll get in .
i know that patience and trust
aren &apos;t necessarily your strong suits ,
but you &apos;ll just have to rise to the occasion , hmm ?
thank you . i &apos;m sure i can do that .
just tell me who got in .
you got in ? congratulations .
oh , shh. don &apos;t say it too loud . i haven &apos;t told anyone yet ,
not even dan , especially not blair .
well , why not ?
oh , i @-@ i couldn &apos;t .
she was wait @-@ listed . it would have been a disaster .
a word of unsolicited advice--
it sounds like you &apos;re worrying about other people
when this is a decision about you .
do you want yale ?
do you know you &apos;re the first person
that &apos;s ever asked me that ?
the truth is , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
the whole reason i went there in the first place
was because of blair , and then i applied because of dan .
honestly , i think yale
might be accepting me for the wrong reasons .
i would never advise anyone to
turn down a great opportunity ,
but going to the right school for you
is the most important thing .
serena , did you hear someone from constance got in ?
i bet it &apos;s that little nelly .
when i find her , she &apos;s not gonna know--hello .
blair , i missed you first period .
i had a meeting .
you also missed getting this back .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , serena .
bye. well , if you &apos;re on a witch hunt ,
that means you can &apos;t be too upset , right ?
witch hunts are my valium , serena .
i &apos;m just trying to stay calm .
what about you ?
i have to say , i &apos;m totally surprised yale passed up
the p.r. of accepting &quot; it &quot; girl serena van der woodsen .
they have more class than i thought .
well , like you pointed out , they didn &apos;t want me for me .
dan must be pissed .
his hope of arriving on campus with cachet
has been shot to hell .
now he &apos;ll just be lumped in
with the rest of the financial aid @-@ iots and poets .
oh , my god .
what ?
i have to go .
hello ?
miss van der woodsen ,
this is shirley from dean berube &apos;s office .
the dean would love to issue a press release
that you &apos;ll be joining yale &apos;s freshman class
in the fall , assuming you &apos;re accepting .
would you mind ? miss van der woodsen ?
um , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
charles has left us no choice .
we wish you had been left in charge of the company ,
of course , but that &apos;s not how it laid out .
well , surely there must be something .
jack is charles &apos; guardian ,
and the contract clearly states
that his guardian has control .
short of being able to prove he &apos;s completely negligent ,
all we can do is our best to temper his actions .
minority shareholders &apos; meeting .
we were just finishing up .
see you soon , i hope , lilian ?
yes , peter , i &apos;d like that .
had i known my own personal
mata hari was going to be here ,
i would have come sooner .
yes , well , i was just being brought up to date
on your progress or lack thereof .
i &apos;ll right myself eventually .
i just have to get my legs under me .
maybe the two of us could come together in some way ,
help me find my strength ... or use it all up .
what &apos;s that for ?
your nose. you don &apos;t seem so worried
about the same morality clause
that cost charles this company .
they won &apos;t touch me .
although i may not be doing a bang @-@ up job yet ,
it beats having a woman of your reputation at the helm .
this is a &quot; b . &quot;
yes , it is .
you &apos;re new here , so you don &apos;t know how it works .
i have a feeling you &apos;re about to explain .
second semester seniors get a free pass ,
like pregnant ladies or 14 @-@ year @-@ old chinese gymnasts .
constance wants their students
to get into the best colleges .
that &apos;s why this free pass exists .
the headmistress-- if she knew about this grade--
she &apos;d rap you on the wrist .
maybe in time , i &apos;ll get in trouble
for not inflating grades like
everyone else , miss waldorf ,
but until then , i &apos;ll give them based on merit .
i need to keep my g.p.a. perfect to get into yale .
you should have thought of that before .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think i might have just lost yale .
what am i gonna do ?
i didn &apos;t apply anywhere else .
just hold on a second .
there &apos;s a phone call i have to return .
the bastard is untouchable .
well , what should we do ?
time to get dirty . i &apos;m all ears .
let me educate you .
did you really try to buy anthrax with his credit card ?
the black market isn &apos;t what it used to be .
and you got him on megan &apos;s list ?
if only his apartment were a few
blocks closer to a playground .
look , i understand why you &apos;re trying to do these things ,
but we have got to do something that is not illegal .
i &apos;ve put calls in to jack &apos;s business associates in australia .
he &apos;s not the most upstanding citizen .
i &apos;m sure we will find something .
you know , i , um , i thought i lost you the day of the funeral ,
and , um , i &apos;m sorry
that jack &apos;s the one to bring us back together ,
but i &apos;m glad that we &apos;re doing this .
if your people don &apos;t come up with anything ,
maybe we could try number 26 .
&quot; crash jack in plane . &quot;
the bass jet is kind of expensive , charles .
there &apos;s insurance .
hello ?
yes. yeah , that would be fine .
i can &apos;t really talk right now .
yes , the , uh , the opera has an early curtain .
rufus , stop it .
okay , okay . i &apos;ll see you then .
bye .
i can &apos;t believe you . you &apos;re actually going
to take your half @-@ price hustler out on the town tonight .
i thought we were putting this behind us , charles .
i &apos;m here to help you .
and what part of you dating someone else
a month after my father &apos;s death is helping me ?
you say you want to be family , but if you really meant it ,
you wouldn &apos;t parade your mistress in public .
you &apos;d have some tact ,
some respect .
this isn &apos;t about your father , charles .
i should have known from your history
i couldn &apos;t count on you .
you think of yourself .
your kids and my dead father are proof of that .
hey , serena .
hey , i was thinking maybe we
could go to yale this weekend ,
get some hope into you. she &apos;s going down .
yes , she &apos;s gonna go .
would you excuse me for a second ?
not really .
i know that look you &apos;re up to no good .
good is subjective ,
and if you don &apos;t believe me , you can look it up .
you want to get rachel back for the grade she gave you .
a new teacher &apos;s like a child . it has to be taught .
and spanked .
and i can &apos;t risk not getting into yale ,
so it &apos;s open season on miss iowa .
time to shuck the corn .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to say anything ,
but you are going to yale. you got in , an early admission .
what ?
how do you know that ?
because i declined my acceptance , you &apos;re next in line .
they &apos;re gonna call you in a couple hours .
you got in ?
you &apos;re the constance student ?
cancel the nelly yuki project now !
s , why would you turn down yale ?
and don &apos;t say for me , because even i wouldn &apos;t believe you .
yeah , why--why would you do that ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry. i @-@ i wanted to tell you .
oh my god
you don &apos;t want to go ?
no. no , i don &apos;t .
no , please . i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll see you later .
so you &apos;re not gonna go after rachel now , right ?
what would be the point ?
okay , okay . so the reason i asked you to come down
is because ...
no , wait , wait , wait. me first .
ever since you got your money back ,
you &apos;ve been taking me to do all these archibald @-@ y things ,
which i love . i just can &apos;t keep up .
so i decided to do something for us .
we &apos;re going to the opera tonight .
wow. that is fantastic .
they &apos;re nosebleed seats , but at least they &apos;re something ,
and i got them .
so what did you bring me up here for anyway ?
well , there &apos;s no reason . i just wanted to see you .
and then &quot; the queen of the night &quot; sings this kick @-@ ass aria ,
&quot; der holle rache kocht in meinem herzen , &quot;
&quot; the vengeance of hell boils in my heart . &quot;
lovely .
it is .
it reaches a high &quot; f , &quot; that never happens in operas .
you know , that &apos;s a good fact .
you should talk about it at intermission .
you &apos;re gonna love &quot; the magic flute . &quot; it &apos;s , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s okay .
you can say it .
opera for amateurs .
if anybody asks you what you thought , just tell &apos; em ,
&quot; ist war wunderschien . danke. und sie ? &quot;
that &apos;s what aus always used to say .
well , that and--and &quot; geh zum teufel , &quot;
but , whatever you do , don &apos;t say that .
okay , this is ridiculous . dad
lily loves you &apos; cause you &apos;re not that guy .
this feels a little different .
only &apos; cause you &apos;re letting it .
no , he &apos;s right .
in our world , people say one thing ,
but they expect something else. if you can hold your own ,
it &apos;ll go a long way with my mom and her friends .
everyone can geh zum teufel . i just want to do right by her .
let &apos;s talk &quot; singspiel , &quot; shall we ? &quot; singspiel . &quot;
the devil would say ,
you &apos;re already in yale . you have security .
now more than ever , you can do what you want . &quot;
and an angel would say ,
all the more reason not to . you have what you want .
you don &apos;t have a perfect transcript .
but you don &apos;t need one . you &apos;re in .
ugh ! i hate having to play the angel .
i know , the devil is so much better .
so , b , who won ?
gimme .
hello . miss carr ? it &apos;s blair waldorf .
how did you get my number ?
i wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier .
i was hoping you &apos;d afford me the chance to move past it .
i &apos;d like that , too ,
but couldn &apos;t this have waited till we saw each other again ?
that &apos;s precisely why i &apos;m calling .
did you know the school has a block of tickets
to the opera tonight ?
to the opera ? no , i didn &apos;t know that .
oh , yes. it &apos;s a gala event , and my family ,
who &apos;s heard all about you ,
asked if you could come to dinner
and then join us in our grand tier seats afterwards .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a good idea in light of today
or at all .
nonsense. we have an extra ticket .
you &apos;re not gonna let our little disagreement
stand in the way of the opera ?
i @-@ i have always wanted to go .
do you have a pen handy ?
yeah .
spotted , b hot for teacher .
too bad miss carr
doesn &apos;t remember the devil is in the details .
what do you say the boathouse in central park ?
we meet at 6 : 30 and walk over for curtain at 8 : 00 .
thank you . sounds wonderful .
yes. yes , it does .
so if you get into yale ...
you go to brown--you did still apply there , right ?
yeah .
that means two trips for us .
or one . we could go to providence first ,
and then hit new haven on the way back , and stop
at the newport creamery on the way down for milkshakes .
oh , my gosh , we could take a week .
we could take our time .
new england is so lovely in the fall .
we could bring jenny and eric .
that sounds great .
i can &apos;t wait .
box two. row two. two for you .
thanks .
you know what ? uh , if you &apos;ll excuse me ?
uh , no , thank you .
uh ... am i glad to see you .
serena and i had to meet up with our parents
before we got here ,
and it went from &quot; family ties &quot; to faulkner ...
ooh. in one cocktail flat .
uh , hey , you excited about your box ?
my what ?
oh , we &apos;re on the third tier , actually. yeah .
it &apos;s , um , a better view and straight on .
third tier &apos;s awesome .
what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing , nothing &apos;s going on .
okay , so there might be some other seats
available to us .
lily. didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here .
who &apos;s your lucky escort this evening ?
someone you picked up at the funeral ?
this is rufus humphrey , the man i &apos;m seeing .
you remember pauletta cho ?
she &apos;s head of publicity for my company .
our company .
yes , hi. it &apos;s nice to see you , pauletta .
but your choice of companion , not so nice .
i &apos;m here to keep an eye on him more than anything else .
hope you both enjoy the show .
and if not , you can ponder why
you thought coming here together was a good idea .
enjoy &quot; tristan und isolde . &quot;
okay .
this isn &apos;t &quot; the magic flute &quot; ?
oh , no .
that opera ended weeks ago ,
and it &apos;s mainly for kids .
ah , kids. you gotta love &apos; em. yeah .
they do such great things ,
like misread the opera calendar .
bruce , hello .
hey , my condolences about bart .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t wanted to call .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to be a bother
in your--your time of grief .
uh , well , now that you &apos;re here ,
what do you want me to do
about those , uh , documents i &apos;d been working on ?
um ... could you wait here for just a moment ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i just need to talk to charles .
um , you two can just talk about
opera while i &apos;m gone .
the answer is so simple. how could i have forgotten it ?
any chance you could try and forget me ?
just meet me back here in 15 minutes .
and if you don &apos;t like what i suggest ,
i won &apos;t bother you again. you have my word .
you don &apos;t have any binoculars , do you ?
oh , or how about those cool little spy glasses ?
or a telescope .
all right , i get it .
you want to go to the stupid box .
not if you don &apos;t want to .
once the show starts ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be great from up here. yeah .
candy , dear ?
you know , it &apos;s not that
you don &apos;t want to go to the same college as me .
it &apos;s not ?
no. a lot of couples go to different schools .
but , you know , for months ,
you acted like going to yale
together was what you wanted .
well , i didn &apos;t figure it out until today .
and brown is just a better fit for me , dan .
well , and what about us ? i mean , do we still &quot; fit &quot; ?
well , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not like we have to decide anything now .
we can just--
what ? we can go on having you make choices
that affect both of our lives
without you talking to me ?
look , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i was just-- i was so happy about yale .
if we went together , you know ,
we &apos;d get four years away
from--from everything and from ...
everyone .
but it looks like our lives are
gonna follow us to college ,
wherever we go .
and what if our parents stay together ?
what happens then ?
more uncomfortable dinners ?
adjoining rooms on family vacations ?
pretending not to hear what we hear
in the middle of the night ?
i mean , who knows how long that &apos;s gonna last for ?
well , you know ,
i think we &apos;ll just have to compartmentalize everything .
the--the two of them will be its own thing
that we &apos;ll put in a box and just keep away somewhere .
things don &apos;t just go in boxes .
they go all together .
no , they don &apos;t .
no , they--they go in boxes with really tight lids
that you bury deep in holes at the bottom of the ocean .
okay .
providence is just a train ride from new haven .
i think we &apos;re just gonna have to try and push through
the next couple of months .
yes .
and knowing them ,
it--it won &apos;t last , right ?
i mean , it can &apos;t .
it could never .
i , uh , studied the wrong opera .
i wanted to impress you and your friends ,
and prove that i could exist
in both your world and mine .
oh , rufus . i don &apos;t care what anyone thinks .
you exist in our world ,
and it &apos;s the only world that matters .
thanks for trying .
oh. oh , god. where are the boxes with the lids ?
why don &apos;t you guys head , um , up to our seats ?
i--there &apos;s something i have to handle first .
okay. yeah .
right behind you .
here we go .
darling , turn off your phone .
remember the kevin kline incident ?
hello , headmistress queller .
blair , i &apos;m sorry to call you after hours ,
but ms. carr told me how upset you were about your grade .
she did ?
i confirmed with her
that so long as the rest of your grades
were up to your usual high standard ,
that you would still end the course with an &quot; a . &quot;
it was sweet of ms. carr to be so concerned .
she &apos;s a good asset to the school .
i think she cares about her students .
she cares about their futures .
have a good weekend . thank you .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to go .
the opera &apos;s about to begin .
it can wait . i have to fix something .
who &apos;s this ?
bruce caplan .
i &apos;m your father &apos;s family lawyer .
before he died ,
your dad was going to legally adopt serena and eric .
and i was going to legally adopt you .
we were serious about becoming a real family ,
and we &apos;d had the papers drawn ,
and your father had signed them .
i just didn &apos;t get to it in time .
your stepmother
asked me to have these faxed over to the box office .
so if you adopt me ...
then i &apos;m your guardian .
give me a pen .
just to be clear , this doesn &apos;t make us family ,
just even .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
you can &apos;t sign anything without my consent .
not anymore .
i &apos;m sending you back where you belong .
you just lost the company .
sticks and stones may break bones ,
but a poison pen is the best revenge .
i was just coming to find you .
inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner ?
telling me the curtain is 8 : 00 and not 7 : 00 ?
i just wanted to teach you a lesson ,
so you knew who was in charge around here .
that &apos;s not the way it works . i &apos;m the teacher , not you .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m going home .
i was on my way to find you and apologize .
&quot; on your way &quot; an hour later ?
i feel terrible . i do .
and ...
as much as i wish i wasn &apos;t , i &apos;m still learning .
it &apos;s like you not inflating your grades .
i can &apos;t not act out against people .
but i &apos;m trying .
so ... please forgive me .
i accept your apology .
come. let &apos;s see if we can find you another ticket .
i &apos;m actually quite tired .
i &apos;ll just see you monday ?
yes , of course .
thank you again .
headmistress ?
rachel ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i just need to talk to you about something .
i hate losing .
you didn &apos;t lose .
you just admitted defeat .
you know what &apos;s great about a box ?
when the opera gets boring ...
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
she should ask you the same thing .
it &apos;s what bart wanted . i &apos;m sorry .
so you say . i &apos;m not so sure .
i &apos;m not scared of you , jack .
you should be .
you &apos;re high and you &apos;re not thinking clearly .
you need to think
about the repercussions of what you &apos;re doing .
i don &apos;t think i do .
i just had a full conversation with this opera @-@ goer
about &quot; the magic flute . &quot;
and he pretended like that was
exactly what he just watched .
i &apos;m beginning to get these society people .
it &apos;s all a big game
of pretending like you know what you &apos;re talking about .
where &apos;s lily ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t seen her all intermission .
keep an eye out for her , huh ?
all right .
chuck .
as much as i hate to ask you anything , have you seen lily ?
my dad &apos;s looking for her .
she said she was going to the powder room .
but that was a while ago .
what &apos;s going on here ?
what are you doing ?
why is this door locked ?
you think you can squeeze me out , take away my power ? !
i worked for this ! i earned it !
jack , it &apos;s over .
stop it ! you can &apos;t do this ! get off me !
i can &apos;t ? who in this town wouldn &apos;t believe that the whore
didn &apos;t ask for it ? ! stop ! please !
hey ! get off her !
you stupid kid .
oh , rufus !
oh , my god . lily !
come on .
get off of me !
oh , my god . thank you .
my hair is terrible . i mean , not since &apos; 91 .
if you care about your hair ,
you &apos;re more a part of my world than ever .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yes . yes , i am .
i &apos;ll see you later .
i heard from the board that
jack is on his way back to sydney .
you didn &apos;t press charges .
no , i just wanted him gone .
but now i &apos;m the , uh , interim head of bass industries ,
believe it or not .
is that why you called me here ?
what you did for me last night
lily ...
it &apos;s okay. you don &apos;t have to feel the same way .
but i do have faith that when you &apos;re ready ,
you will do wonders
with bass industries .
what are you talking about ?
on your 18th birthday , i want you to have everything .
i don &apos;t want this job or the corporate jet
or anything related to this business .
just you ,
as a part of my family .
look ...
i know what happened to my father was an accident .
it was a terrible accident .
and , um ...
if the offer still stands ...
i &apos;d like to move back in .
i would love that .
the thing about new beginnings
is that they require something else to end .
hey ! i &apos;m just on my way out .
miss blair , we must go or we be late .
the headmistress asked if i could come meet her at school .
i figured she wants to have tea
like we did when i first applied to yale .
what are you doing ? i &apos;m just reading the brown catalogue .
oh , and i ordered a home dreadlocking kit .
wanna meet up later ?
definitely. maybe we can get
a jump start on your veganism .
have some celebratory seitan at angelica kitchen ?
mm , i can &apos;t think of anything better ...
or grosser .
i &apos;ll call you after .
okay .
some endings take a long time to reveal themselves .
but when they do , they &apos;re almost too easy to ignore .
serena calling .
call ignored .
hey , ms. carr . what are you doing here ?
rachel .
and i &apos;m taking your advice to
come out to brooklyn sometime .
can i--can i get you anything ? i make a mean cappuccino .
well , all i have to do is press &quot; start , &quot; but i like to pretend .
that sounds great. yeah .
here , sit .
some beginnings start so quietly ,
you don &apos;t even notice they &apos;re happening .
so you &apos;ve been on the subway now .
you &apos;ve made it out to a borough .
how &apos;s the city working out for ya ?
i think i &apos;m getting the hang of it .
like anything else , you just have to make it work for you .
but most endings come when you least expect them ,
and what they portend
is darker than you &apos;ve ever imagined .
i called you here this morning
because ms. carr told me what you did .
you leave me no choice but to give you detention .
yale has been notified .
your acceptance has been placed on hold .
if you complete detention to my satisfaction ,
yale will still be possible .
but if you do not ...
put that puppy down , dorota .
what happened , miss blair ?
it &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen that
you should be worried about .
not all beginnings are cause for celebration .
a lot of bad things begin-- fight , flu season ,
and the worst thing of all ...
uh @-@ oh . is it war ?
yes .
but this one will be different .
i need to wait for my moment ,
and then i &apos;m going black ops--
off the radar , no accountability .
this war , i &apos;m gonna win .
wanna be starting somethin &apos; .
