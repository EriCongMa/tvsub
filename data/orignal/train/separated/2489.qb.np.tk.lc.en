please let it be a bear that did this .
how much did i eat ?
homie , you can &apos;t keep doing this to yourself .
i &apos;m as healthy as a horse .
horses only live 30 years .
what ?
if you could just ease up on the eating after 3 : 00 a.m.
that &apos;s all i ask .
marge is right .
i &apos;m gonna walk upstairs , take her in my arms
and tell her my good health starts now !
legs pumping . blood flowing .
two at a time .
heart exploding .
ooh . pepperoni .
all that &apos;s left are clever last words .
侯默 · 辛普森的葬礼 早就说过了
and so we mourn the loss of homer j. simpson .
beloved husband , father and poorly informed sports fan .
all he did was yell &quot; traveling &quot; at the screen .
major condolences on your bereavement , dear .
if , uh ... you know , after
a respectful period of grief and whatnot , uh ...
yous would like to have some coffee , please give a call .
普通人
thank you , moe .
stop !
stop with the wailing and the gnashing and the aye ...
homer is not dead !
i have made a copy .
i &apos;m number two .
you &apos;re alive !
but how ?
uh , well ...
i was able to put homer &apos;s memories in the body of a clone ,
identical to the original in every way .
i wanted to clone a sheep ,
but i needed to start with something simpler .
which he is , because his brain is fliveck .
oh ... dad , you &apos;re back !
just in time for my recital .
somebody kill me .
now , homie . i hope you use this second chance
to live a more sensible life .
amen , baby .
did you make potato salad for the wake ?
yes .
that man sure loved potato salad .
ah , hey , midge . uh ...
here we are again , ah ?
yeah ...
and , oh , uh , here , uh , my new card .
yeah .
i &apos;m back ! coming through !
yeah .
i can die all i want .
frink &apos;s got homers like the tuileries has park benches .
huh ? i wonder where i picked that up .
oh . i planted a western history chip ,
but all you retained were the places to sit down .
nice !
* letting the days go by *
* let the water hold me down *
* letting the days go by *
* water flowing underground *
* into the blue again *
* after the money &apos;s gone *
* once in a lifetime ... *
homer , you &apos;ll be all right ,
but , uh , no solid food for two weeks .
aw ... two weeks ?
* same as it ever was , same as it ever was *
* same as it ever was , same as it ever was *
we are gathered here to mourn the passing of
yet another homer simpson .
beloved father ,
precious memories , local character , et cetera .
okay . we &apos;re ready for the crematorium bot .
wait a minute !
don &apos;t go far , cremo .
oh , moe , are we doing this again ?
you know what ? no .
i &apos;m tired of getting my hopes up here .
you and your immortal husband can go take a flying leap , huh ?
um , i am so very sorry , but , uh , this time ,
i could not bring homer back to life .
wha ... ?
stupid moe .
you just had to act like yourself ,
didn &apos;t you , you jackass ?
all is not lost .
i was able to download homer &apos;s brain
into this flash drive . it &apos;ll have to do .
yo . where &apos;s my body ?
oh , you used up all your clones ,
you fat , fat , fat , reckless , fat pig !
from now on , you &apos;re just going to be a face on a monitor .
so , enjoy screen saver mode !
ooh . corner .
let me just say this once .
i &apos;m good .
hey , kids .
want to chase grandpa homer around the house ?
i do !
yay !
after 35 years of wifely obedience ,
i &apos;m married to a face on a screen .
not exactly fun and games for me , either , marge .
ooh ... goody gobble !
liquid center power @-@ up !
how are you , milhouse ?
things aren &apos;t great with lisa .
if it wasn &apos;t for that squirrel that eats our bird food ,
we &apos;d have nothing to talk about .
as i told you when we talked last month ,
&quot; i &apos;ve been doing a lot of charity work for the undead . &quot;
uh , marge , excuse me .
uh ... i think i need a reboot .
just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole
and hold it for 15 minutes .
no . i &apos;m throwing you out of the house .
you can live with your no @-@ good son .
hey . what did i do ?
nothing for 30 years .
you &apos;re perfect for each other .
no . no . no . don &apos;t pull me out
before you click eject .
that hurts like a mother ... !
so , dad , what do you think of my place ?
son , could you put me in 3 @-@ d for a second ?
why , you little ... !
i &apos;ll teach you to emulate my sloppiness !
okay , guys .
time for you to go to your mother &apos;s .
here &apos;s your mom &apos;s house .
hi , jerry .
hey , bart. great to see you , man .
how are you ?
great . great . so , i guess you and jenda are still together ?
is she there ?
oh , yeah . she &apos;s just getting out of the shower .
hey , you &apos;re looking good , man .
you been working out or what ?
no .
you &apos;re lucky , man .
i have to hit the gym like every day ,
or i &apos;m like ...
hey , baby .
hurry , boys .
we &apos;re going camping this weekend .
but our thing was camping .
living out of a car is not &quot; camping . &quot;
that &apos;s right , babe .
bye .
good @-@ bye , daddy !
take care , bart.
hey . check &apos;s due on the first ,
whether it &apos;s a weekend or not .
dad , if i ever needed fatherly wisdom ,
it &apos;s now .
okay , everyone .
jolly did a great job standing on her hind legs .
what does she get ?
a goat !
cheer up , bart.
you &apos;re working with dinosaurs .
i miss my kids .
come on . you &apos;re free and sleazy .
i know some adult dancers that work with my mom .
isn &apos;t your mom 87 ?
with social security a thing of the past ,
she can &apos;t afford to retire .
i don &apos;t know how that happened in a senate with 99 democrats .
that one republican is great at getting his way .
废弃大脑 请勿投入脑干
brains .
actually , terrance ,
this is a synthetic substance .
devised for zombie vegans .
or &quot; zegans . &quot;
what are you doing here ?
you weren &apos;t answering your phone .
i was worried you might have been bitten .
oh . zombies not able to control selves .
all we do bite , bite , bite .
you , sir , am racist .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re one of the good ones .
not to imply that there are any bad ones , of course ,
but all stereotypes come from a place of ...
still . meh .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for this , man .
dude , it &apos;s been two years since the divorce .
ooh . i love your perfume .
can i smell you later ?
why don &apos;t you smell me now ?
well , that didn &apos;t look so hard .
you know , at my job ,
i satisfy ladies even bigger than you .
um , i feed dinosaurs .
sir , you have to leave .
you &apos;re bumming out everybody ,
and you have , like , a goat beard stuck to your shoe .
向曾经很酷的人提供
one , please .
man , that &apos;s some targeted advertising .
让你的现在远离过去
after this procedure ,
you will have total closure from your divorce .
how long does this take ?
it &apos;ll be over before i finish this ...
... sentence .
wow . it works .
i &apos;m completely over my ex @-@ wife .
do you take wedding bands as tips ?
put it in the jar .
one more injection in two weeks , and you &apos;re cured .
but until then ,
you may experience some zombie @-@ ism .
brains .
no . those are just teaching brains .
they &apos;re like the plastic sushi in front of a japanese restaurant .
window sushi fake ?
window sushi fake .
ay , caramba . i have moved on .
hey , passable @-@ looking .
sorry . i &apos;m just a little creeped out
by that screen saver .
nothing to worry about .
he &apos;s been frozen like that for days .
* girls *
* all i really want is girls *
* and in the morning it &apos;s girls *
wow . now i see why they call you miss hoover .
you must have been vacuuming for an hour .
anything to please my man .
so , was it good for you ?
&quot; good &quot; is not a concept in my culture !
oh , my god . we went home with you ?
not just me .
there &apos;s beppo , boppo , emmett kelly the ninth ,
frenchy , insane clown polly and commodore tee @-@ hee .
brains ? brains ?
garden brains .

give me your wallet !
what seems to be the oopsie here ?
yay ! i &apos;m fighting crime !
officer needs backup .
there , back up .
the old milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack .
no breathing , no asthma .
i love how you &apos;re dropping all your definite articles .
brevity soul wit .
uh , what are you cooking ?
nothing .
you know , dad really misses you .
well , i don &apos;t miss his nonsense .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons
that i &apos;m starting to suspect was him .
look , maybe i shouldn &apos;t have done this ,
but i &apos;ve got him right here .
sorry , i must have recorded over dad .
but admit it .
when you thought it was dad , you were excited .
it &apos;s only natural
to miss a man you buried 127 times .
hey , homer , your robot body finally came .
about time !
hey , where &apos;s my junk ?
hello ?
oh , you boys look happy .
yeah , but mom &apos;s sad .
jerry moved out .
i thought he was the one , bart.
i just put in a saltwater tank
where he could shed his exoskeleton .
and now when i walk by it , i feel like a fool .
he &apos;s the fool . you &apos;re great .
you &apos;re just saying that because you have to .
i don &apos;t have to say anything .
believe me , no guy wants
to see his ex looking hot or being sweet .
makes him realize everything he &apos;s lost .
wow . wow . you &apos;ve really grown .
we should have dinner sometime .
hey , dad , can you watch the boys ?
sure .
body , to moe &apos;s .
hey , you &apos;re kind of quiet tonight , homer .
you know , this was a great evening .
please enjoy your desserts .
man , when is that voice gonna change ?
suddenly , i want a different dessert .
but they brought us little cakes and ...
ay , caramba .
被锅炉房老鼠果腹
oop , oop , uh , yeah , open your stance a little there .
oh ! yeah , that &apos;s it .
do your worst , kids !
come on !
hug your grandpa , boys !
threat perceived . terminate ! terminate !
kids are so afraid of being terminated .
looking good , santa &apos;s little hybrid .
father , what am i ?
guys , sit down .
our lives are gonna change a little .
uh @-@ oh . this is never good .
this is good .
your father and i are gonna try to make it work again .
like a classic rock band
whose hold @-@ out member finally needs money .
wow . everyone &apos;s back together except gramma and grampa .
oh , i think that &apos;s about to change .
aren &apos;t you going to work , dad ?
one of us has to stay home with you guys .
and your mom can &apos;t quit her job at google .
they need my help hunting down those self @-@ driving cars
that turned evil .
oh , you passed another rest stop !
i am not stopping again .
but i had a large soda !
i said get the small !
it was only 50 cents more !
let &apos;s play the quiet game !
now , will somebody hold up a one dollar bill ?
uh @-@ oh . it looks like we woke someone up from her nap .
well , now that you &apos;re up , you can do your juggling act .
milhouse , you were supposed to come see me today
for your final anti @-@ zombie injection .
yes , well , uh ...
but i &apos;m supposed to be in surgery now ,
so i guess we &apos;re both playing hooky .
but , lisa , if you want milhouse to return to his old self ,
then you &apos;d better bring him in for that shot tomorrow .
but , doctor ...
: he &apos;s so much more interesting this way .
ooh . i see .
now enjoy the majesty of our prehistoric past .
so , that earring i lost in the teleport ,
turns out it &apos;s in florida .
yes !
that &apos;s not a listening @-@ to @-@ me &quot; yes . &quot;
you &apos;re watching something .
what ? me ? oh , that &apos;s crazy .
you know , i knew it .
this is supposed to be us time , and you &apos;re lensing a game .
well , you &apos;re not paying attention to me .
you &apos;re texting .
yeah , only to complain about you not paying any attention to me .
if i wasn &apos;t paying attention ,
then how did i notice you not paying attention
to my not paying attention ? ha !
oh , i thought this time things were gonna be different .
they are .
you &apos;re four years older .
wow . what does that mean ?
hey , bart , what &apos;ll it be ?
a tall beer and no judgmental women .
that is so typical of you .
what are you doing here ?
i have to decide whether to make milhouse ...
... human again .
i even prefer the way he smells now .
some meat went bad in our freezer ,
and my heart skipped a beat .
phoo ! you two don &apos;t know what a rough marriage is .
mom , i got to know .
once and for all , what is the secret ?
why did you stay with dad so long ?
until i was eight , i thought he was a magical gorilla .
look , life &apos;s tough .
it &apos;s hard to make it through .
the only way i know is when you make a decision
that comes from your heart , you stick with it .
like my marriage .
or my divorce .
or my decision to support duffman in his old age .
duffman can still swing and party .
oh , yeah .
wait , mom .
does that mean you &apos;re going to take dad back ?
no , i &apos;m going to join him forever .
i can &apos;t tell if that was love , suicide
or a ... a really boring video game .
lisa , your husband is ... fine .
no residual zombie @-@ ism whatsoever .
are you sure ?
watch . i &apos;ll just wave this juicy brain in front of him .
i &apos;m gonna faint !
hooray .
so , jenda , i don &apos;t know what love is ,
but i know what it isn &apos;t , and we &apos;re isn &apos;t .
yeah . you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s why i started seeing jerry again without telling you .
hey , buddy , how , uh , how you doing ?
what ? ! oh !
you know what , jenda ?
i &apos;m not even mad ,
because i &apos;m finally , completely over you .
... sentence .
wait . what am i doing back here ?
you never left .
everything that you experienced
between when i flipped the switch and now
was just a neural implant in your temporal lobe .
uh , you should look at my profile .
it was all a dream , and now you can go home .
so , you &apos;re sure i &apos;m cured ?
no more feelings for my ex @-@ wife ?
i &apos;m positive .
we treat a lot of people for obsessions .
it &apos;s a whole new day for nothing stu !
wow . i &apos;m free .
get ready , world .
i &apos;ve got a whole new set of mistakes to make .
uh , ol &apos; gil could use a fresh start .
weren &apos;t you just in here this morning ?
i &apos;ve had a bad day .
after 35 years of marriage ,
we &apos;ve finally gotten it right .
yes , even my personality has gotten ,
shall we say , an upgrade .
oh ! that &apos;s a bit of a whoo @-@ hoo indeed .
lis , i hope things work out with you and milhouse ,
but if they don &apos;t , i know just where you should go .
thanks , but milhouse and i are in
a pretty good place .
even though he &apos;s not a zombie anymore ?
no , that &apos;s what happened in your false memories .
there is no cure for zombie @-@ ism .
dead flower from dead husband .
and i was a false memory , too .
no , you were real .
aw , shucks .
