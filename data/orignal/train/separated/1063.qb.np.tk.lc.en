your dad told me that our department
is filled with dirty cops and they set him up .
and he &apos;s right about one thing .
there are dirty cops .
senator terrence pratt .
you said pratt could hurt you .
my brakes -- i don &apos;t have my brakes .
you need to leave new york .
mozzie has a safe house outside the city .
it turns out that employer i.d. number
is for a security company named griffin @-@ moore ,
which is linked to the 50th floor
of the empire state building .
let &apos;s get that box and bring my father home .
13 bucks for an ice cream ?
gluten- and dairy @-@ free -- you won &apos;t find that in kansas .
yes , i will .
forget it .
nothing like a happy customer .
ooh . i have to change my prices .
the tourists are still bothering me .
makes it tough to do recon .
so , where were we ?
on the 50th floor .
by &quot; we , &quot; of course , i meant &quot; me , &quot;
because you can &apos;t get off @-@ leash .
it &apos;s casing an office . i think you can handle it , moz .
okay , then you man the cart .
no , i can &apos;t stick around that long .
peter &apos;s checking my tracking data .
we can &apos;t give him any reason to believe
that we know where ellen hid the evidence .
i got a good thing going here .
oh . i had a good thing going here .
mozzie has a permit .
i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;ll take a pistachio , please .
13 -- 15 bucks .
i should arrest you for your prices .
for an officer of the law , it &apos;s on the house .
that &apos;s bribery .
then pay .
so , this is where you set up your recon , huh ?
oh , that &apos;s good .
you believe ellen hid the evidence
on the 50th floor , right ?
peter , there &apos;s no need for you to get involved in this .
neal .
i wish i could tell you more , but i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t because elizabeth told you not to .
elizabeth told you ?
come on .
scram . just 17 bucks a scoop !
you have to understand the position i was in .
you were in the hospital ,
elizabeth was worried about you ...
until she realized that forcing you to keep a secret from me
wasn &apos;t gonna make the situation any safer .
how long have you known ?
since the accident .
i actually thought i was ahead of you this time .
getting that evidence isn &apos;t only about vindicating your father .
it &apos;s about bringing pratt to justice .
he forced hughes out of the fbi to keep that box hidden .
i want to see what &apos;s inside it .
and we &apos;re gonna find it .
for those of you
that i have not had the good fortune of meeting ,
my name is amanda callaway .
did we miss something ?
and i am very excited to ...
amanda callaway -- ran the atlanta white collar division .
she &apos;s replacing hughes ?
there were a lot of people ahead of her on the list .
and new york &apos;s a big step up from atlanta .
after you .
i loved atlanta .
i really did , but atlanta is no new york .
and i know that there are a lot of case loads ...
she was asking for you .
in a good way ?
hard to tell .
i can never replace agent hughes .
i don &apos;t want to .
i will run this division differently .
i plan on taking a more involved approach .
we will make new york white collar
the pride of the bureau once again .
i don &apos;t like her .
shh .
thank you .
that should be you , peter .
you should be leading white collar .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
they &apos;re right .
well , the bureau chiefs know i love the field more than a desk .
and besides , they can &apos;t let my little jaunt to cape verde go .
where , by the way , you captured one of their most wanted .
well , after my demotion to evidence ,
i &apos;m just happy to be in the division .
agent burke .
agent callaway , congratulations .
oh , my gosh .
i was so happy to hear
that you were still here at new york white collar .
13 years .
that &apos;s amazing .
neal caffrey . a pleasure .
oh , the pleasure is all mine , agent callaway .
thank you .
and when i heard about the opening here ,
i researched your division
and found out you guys really get it done .
in no small part due to reese hughes .
he was a very supportive boss .
yeah , i noticed . i like results .
speaking of which , i like to get them above board ,
so let &apos;s keep that in mind over your next case .
which case is that ?
well , you two have a knack for closing art @-@ forgery cases ,
and there have been some suspicions
about the new bernini discovery .
that &apos;s a multi @-@ million dollar sculpture .
and if it &apos;s fake .
we can bust the seller ,
have a quick , high @-@ profile win right out of the gate .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to show the bureau
that this division is back on track .
didn &apos;t think we were off track .
well , somebody did , or else i wouldn &apos;t be here .
did you mention the empire state building
in your file on pratt ?
no . i left it out of the report .
you &apos;re worried callaway might be connected to the senator ?
well , she was nice to me .
when people are nice , they &apos;re usually working an angle .
what ?
i &apos;ll look into callaway .
in the meantime ,
let &apos;s just try and get her that quick win she asked for .
monsieur caffrey .
henri .
bonjour .
ah , there &apos;s a hillside village in the french riviera
known for sculpture , and --
you &apos;re old friends . i get it .
peter burke , his handler .
so , you think it &apos;s real ?
scuff marks here .
they look like rope burns .
yeah , cotton @-@ braided rope was the preferred method
to pulley and move sculpture during the napoleonic war .
there &apos;s added plaster in the plinth .
bernini did that himself
when his patron , marcantonio borghese ,
moved the piece to a larger entryway .
in his home .
excellent .
neal , you can browse when we &apos;re done .
what sold me was the seal on the 1842 shipping orders
from the port of bordeaux --
that red pigment is impossible to find today .
trust me .
as far as the aesthetic ,
bernini was the first and only artist of his time
to explore the idea of metamorphosis in marble .
this is the real aphrodite .
excellent . then --
as for the one over here --
ah , the dubois .
&quot; hand over hand . &quot;
one of the four remaining pieces in his catalog .
yeah , it just sold at auction last week for $ 6.5 million .
it was .
yeah . they &apos;re gonna want their money back .
it &apos;s a fake .
we are the exclusive dealers of olivier dubois &apos; work .
this piece has already been authenticated and sold .
that doesn &apos;t make it any less of a forgery .
why don &apos;t you explain exactly why you think it &apos;s a fake ?
well , technically , all the style elements are there .
i mean , it &apos;s a brilliant forgery --
it &apos;s too good .
it &apos;s subtle , but these lines where the hands meet
feel ever so slightly forced to dimension ,
where a dubois would flow more easily , less exact .
dubois may have changed techniques
just as he shifted motifs in his final years .
every dubois contains his unique signature --
a hand @-@ written note inserted into the center of the marble .
what &apos;s on it ?
well , supposedly , he exposes the heart of the piece ,
but no one knows exactly .
that &apos;s part of the mystique of his work .
we verified with x @-@ ray diffraction .
a scroll is inside .
are you familiar with chicken sexers ?
no , i don &apos;t believe i am .
baby chickens need to be sorted into males and females .
the sorters are called sexers .
the only problem is baby chicks look identical .
this will loop back to the dubois ?
the japanese developed a fool @-@ proof technique ,
but the only way to teach it is to pick up a chick
and place it in either the male or the female bin .
neal .
now , at first they &apos;re just guessing .
a teacher will stand behind a student and say &quot; yes &quot;
each time they guess correctly .
but after a few months , a student is able
to sort the chicks correctly 100 % of the time ,
and to this day , no one is able to articulate why .
there is a scientific basis for instinct .
and as dubois @-@ esque as this seems ,
it &apos;s not a dubois .
who sold you the piece ?
dubois &apos; protg , j.b. bellmiere .
until dubois &apos; death last year ,
a man named j.b. bellmiere
worked as his apprentice .
he &apos;s the man who authenticates dubois &apos; work .
he &apos;s considered the ultimate authority .
agent callaway .
agent burke . please , don &apos;t let me interrupt you .
peter was just explaining that if the dubois is a forgery ,
then bellmiere would be our prime suspect .
i see . and this is based
on caffrey &apos;s highly critical chicken sexer theory ?
he ... may have mentioned that .
at the time of dubois &apos; death ,
there were four sculptures in his catalog
that had never gone to market .
&quot; hand over hand &quot; is the first one to surface .
are you suggesting that bellmiere ,
as his apprentice , could have forged it ?
i am .
interesting theory .
peter , when you &apos;re finished here ,
will you see me in my office ?
of course .
hey . how you holding up ?
mozzie &apos;s safehouse is a 10 @-@ by @-@ 10 underground bomb shelter
in the middle of the woods
surrounded by a pig farm and a bog .
i take it you &apos;re ready for a change of venue ?
i &apos;m ready for my freedom . any updates ?
yeah , we &apos;re getting close .
how close ? weeks ? days ?
i can &apos;t say yet .
listen , peter &apos;s involved now .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
well , it is .
listen , i should be there . let me help .
no , we can &apos;t risk it .
we got a new boss at the bureau --
she &apos;s keeping a close eye on us .
i &apos;ll let you know the minute we locate the box .
do it soon .
i want you to move off the bellmiere case .
what ? why ?
there &apos;s just not enough hard evidence .
yet .
look , if you want to dig into this in your own time ,
feel free .
just don &apos;t do it on the bureau &apos;s .
if neal &apos;s right -- and i trust his hunch --
we &apos;re dealing with a world @-@ class forger .
but we have a growing stack of cases
with conclusive data we can work .
you and neal are an impressive team , but you &apos;re too impulsive .
focus your energy on cases we can close .
efficiency is our most important tool .
i get it .
we want a quick , high @-@ profile win to impress the bureau .
there you go .
you &apos;re gonna drop the case ?
no , i can &apos;t let a multi @-@ million dollar forger go
just because it might not be an easy win .
that &apos;s why they should have given you the job .
they &apos;re gonna realize that .
i don &apos;t want it .
it would have been nice to be asked .
yeah .
hey , neal .
hey .
come on in .
what was so urgent ?
well , how would you like to meet the man
behind that magnificent forgery you spotted ?
you found more information on bellmiere ?
yeah . his real name &apos;s jeff blatnik .
well , you can &apos;t fault him for changing his name .
a lot of artists change their name .
so do con artists .
i &apos;d buy a bellmiere over a blatnik --
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
but he didn &apos;t sell a bellmiere . he sold a dubois .
mm , true .
the second dubois in his catalog ...
or is it ?
that &apos;s so close .
bellmiere has an incredible eye .
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s not a dubois .
while you look for j.b. ,
why don &apos;t i find out what his students have to say ?
go .
original .
conceptual .
i &apos;m gonna say the wires represent industry --
an endless loop spiraling downward .
you get me .
i &apos;ve been following the bellmiere school
for a while .
neal .
natasha .
i run the haversham gallery in portland .
oh , i &apos;ll ... get mr. bellmiere .
oh , in a little bit .
i want to see if any of the other pieces
speak to me like yours does .
knock it over .
come on ! break it !
it either works , or it doesn &apos;t .
last chance .
now you can start fresh .
dubois taught me that .
destruction is part of creation .
who are you ?
i &apos;m peter burke , fbi .
need your help .
let &apos;s cut through the facade , agent burke .
you &apos;re here because you want to know
if the dubois that i sold to the tibedaux is a forgery .
any information you have on the piece would help .
who suggested it was a fake ?
one of their experts .
&quot; experts . &quot;
i am the expert on dubois .
of course .
the complaint was
that somehow the lines lacked a certain subtlety
found in other dubois pieces .
&quot; hand over hand &quot; may not be
as inspired as some of his earlier works ,
but perhaps that &apos;s why he gave it to me .
he gave you a $ 6.5 million statue ?
i gave him 10 years .
where can i see some of mr. bellmiere &apos;s work ?
oh , he doesn &apos;t have any on display .
really ? nothing ?
well , he &apos;s ... been spending a lot of time
in his private workspace -- off the hallway .
you seen what he &apos;s been working on ?
oh , no one has . he works alone .
it &apos;s his process .
maybe i can convince him to give me a sneak peak .
good luck .
thanks .
out of curiosity , what does your work sell for ?
i &apos;m taking my time to define what makes a bellmiere .
so , you don &apos;t have anything on the market , huh ?
mm . thank you .
did you see any of bellmiere &apos;s work ?
yeah , two partially completed sculptures .
oh . he really is taking his time to find his own vision .
is that what he told you ?
oh , &quot; some ideas come fully formed .
others take years . &quot;
well , he &apos;s fully formed ones come from dubois .
so , he &apos;s forging the last two catalog pieces .
the same rare marble , technique , style .
well , we can &apos;t make a bust until he tries to sell one of them .
bellmiere &apos;s already made millions off &quot; hand over hand . &quot;
he could sit on the other three for years
when their value skyrockets .
is there any way he &apos;d want to sell them earlier ?
i could encourage him .
but i &apos;m gonna need about 500 pounds of marble .
all right .
entrez , moz .
hey .
good to see you , too , kid .
it &apos;s too risky for you to be here .
i can &apos;t take mozzie &apos;s safehouse anymore .
why ?
he &apos;s a very weird dude .
yeah .
so , what am i looking at ?
dubois &apos; &quot; devolution . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , but you got to go back .
listen , you &apos;ve been looking for that evidence box for , what ,
three months now ?
i &apos;ve been after it for 30 years .
now you say you &apos;re close .
when witsec moved ellen to new york 12 years ago ,
they gave her a job at a securities firm .
she had access to the 50th floor of the empire state building
while it was under renovation .
you think she planted it there ?
moz has been casing the place all day .
we &apos;ll know soon .
so ... we wait .
yeah .
we wait .
i &apos;ve heard of dubois .
yeah , well , one of his pieces just sold for $ 6.5 million --
it was a forgery .
so , you &apos;re doing this for work ?
yeah , i have to pass this off as a real dubois .
hey , moz .
as fond as i am of the japanese culture ,
i could go the rest of my life without hearing &quot; chiizu &quot; again .
japanese for &quot; say cheese &quot; ?
among other things .
hello , mozzie .
is that james ?
you &apos;re on speaker .
james , what happened ?
he was going stir @-@ crazy .
at my cabin ? but it &apos;s so picturesque .
there are no windows .
insufficient motivation .
however , your premature arrival is actually well @-@ timed .
me and my photos will be there momentarily .
neal and i visited his studio off hours --
as you suggested .
i did not suggest for you
to spend 15 grand of this division &apos;s money
on rare italian marble .
that was well within my discretionary budget
for developing investigations .
i will look into the discretionary budget later .
right now , explain the marble .
we believe bellmiere is forging the remaining two dubois .
okay .
but he could sit on them for years ,
so neal is sculpting one of the two .
once it &apos;s authenticated --
it &apos;ll drive bellmiere crazy
because it &apos;ll be millions of dollars out of his pocket .
right .
neal reaches out to bellmiere , offers his skills ,
and we draw a confession from collusion .
it &apos;s risky .
it &apos;s efficient and high @-@ profile .
did hughes authorize you to go after these types of operations ?
he trusted me .
it cost him his job .
i like this job .
i don &apos;t want to lose it .
reese didn &apos;t lose his job over a $ 15,000 expense .
no , he lost it because he approved you
to go after someone you couldn &apos;t beat .
you read our file on senator pratt .
i did .
is that investigation still open ?
she asked you to close the case against pratt ?
no , she closed the case against pratt .
she &apos;s got to be in his pocket .
i haven &apos;t found a link .
but if you were sexing chickens --
callaway is ambitious and pragmatic .
she knows that our investigation into pratt forced hughes out ,
so she may just be protecting her job .
she &apos;s reading your logs pretty carefully .
yeah , it &apos;s gonna be a challenge
to keep the empire state off her radar .
especially with my father back in town .
send him back -- immediately .
i tried .
if we force him , he &apos;ll just go rogue ,
which will be even more problematic .
i guess that answers the age @-@ old question
of nature versus nurture .
our authenticators are in deep discussion .
they better go for it .
have you seen the provenance ?
what is bellmiere doing here ?
he wasn &apos;t supposed to show up
until after the piece was authenticated .
if he claims it &apos;s a fraud --
his word may supercede the experts &apos; .
he can &apos;t see you . he &apos;s gonna smell a setup .
leslie .
j.b. , i didn &apos;t want to trouble you with this
until we had it authenticated .
if a dubois is coming to market , i know about it .
someone &apos;s claiming
it &apos;s the second of the four remaining pieces .
the exploration of figurative techniques
wasn &apos;t until he met his fifth wife .
it &apos;s hard to tell from the catalog photos ,
but it certainly tracks with the timeline .
did you check the palm ?
unfinished .
dubois left the palms untouched in his abstractions .
2004 -- he made nothing else that year .
and inside ?
that &apos;s what convinced us . we ran the x @-@ ray .
no . this is not ... a dubois .
it is the dubois .
it is the height of his mastery and his seminal work .
who are you ?
neal caffrey . i own this piece .
i &apos;m very curious , mr. caffrey .
how did you come to own &quot; devolution &quot; ?
i imagine much the same way
as you came to own the dubois you sold last week .
yours is a fraud .
are you questioning the experts ?
i wouldn &apos;t .
that would make it much more difficult
for you to sell the remaining three --
excuse me , now two duboises .
what do you want ?
there is an arrangement where we each sell one .
&quot; sisters &quot; is already on display in my loft .
everyone knows that .
but no one &apos;s seen &quot; courtship &quot; yet , have they ?
come to my studio tomorrow -- 2 : 00 .
good instincts .
yep . trust the chicken sexers .
afternoon .
yep . that it is .
any ideas on the box ?
well , i &apos;m developing a theory .
when ellen and i were partners ,
we busted our fair share of hideouts .
when it came to finding stashes , we had a saying --
&quot; walls move , ceilings and floors don &apos;t . &quot;
well , the floors are marble .
you think she hid it in the ceiling ?
well , if i was a betting man ...
all you got to do is scan 1,000 square feet of ceiling tile .
we &apos;ve narrowed our search from all of manhattan
to a ceiling in the corner of a building .
we &apos;re gonna find it .
optimist .
ah , good mood .
they must have bought your sculpture .
they did .
what did they say ?
they said it wasn &apos;t a dubois --
it was the dubois .
you &apos;re kidding .
they called it his seminal work .
i knew it ! attaboy !
full disclosure .
that helps explain
what i found while you were out .
such as ?
oh ... such as a van dyck ...
... and this degas .
they &apos;re forgeries .
they &apos;re flawless .
flawless .
you have a tremendous gift , neal .
your original work must be extraordinary .
i don &apos;t have many original pieces .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , that &apos;s a shame .
because if you can do this ...
you &apos;re capable of anything .
all right , here &apos;s my proposal --
we finish &quot; courtship , &quot; split the profits 50 / 50 .
well , let &apos;s be clear -- forgery is a federal offense .
this is a dubois replica .
understood .
the contours and planes complement each other well .
i &apos;m impressed .
a shame i have to destroy it .
what &apos;s the point of making a replica
of a piece you &apos;ve already sold ?
dubois used to say , &quot; don &apos;t get attached to your work . &quot;
neal &apos;s figured out a way to
nail bellmiere on forgery .
you promised me a confession .
now i &apos;m promising you hard evidence .
keep talking .
dubois put an original , hand @-@ written note
into the heart of each piece .
yes , i know . the tibedaux x @-@ rayed it and found it .
the x @-@ ray only verified its existence ,
not what was on it .
yeah , if the scroll contains
bellmiere &apos;s handwriting and fingerprints
and not dubois &apos; , then it &apos;s a forgery .
what are you suggesting ? that we smash it open ?
well , there &apos;s probably a --
fortunately , we have another option .
a high @-@ resolution imaging scanner .
the new magnetic tomography scanners
are portable and powerful enough
to pick up fingerprints on a gun through a brick wall .
it &apos;s still neal &apos;s word against bellmiere &apos;s .
i don &apos;t think a judge is gonna approve a warrant .
we don &apos;t need one .
you have a confidential informant
who has access to the sculpture .
all right .
but i &apos;m gonna go with you -- i &apos;m gonna oversee this .
and it &apos;s not because i don &apos;t trust you , peter .
it &apos;s because i don &apos;t trust him .
you said this was a high @-@ profile case , and you &apos;re right .
i want a clean conviction , no detours .
have you got it , neal ?
he &apos;s got it .
i didn &apos;t ask you , peter .
got it .
okay , great . then we shouldn &apos;t have any problem .
i know that look . i don &apos;t like that look .
what are you thinking ?
i know how we can find the box in the empire state building .
the scanner .
yeah .
no .
that little device is worth a small dubois .
i can &apos;t just check it out like a library book .
i &apos;ll use it while
i &apos;m supposed to be in bellmiere &apos;s loft .
did you miss the part about no detours ?
callaway &apos;s gonna be in the van .
okay , there you go .
thanks .
i &apos;m not gonna jeopardize our first operation .
she won &apos;t know a thing .
this is not a wink and a nod . no .
i hear you .
i don &apos;t think you do .
what ?
i need you to say , &quot; i will not use the scanner
to search the empire state building . &quot;
i will not use the scanner
to search the empire state building .
&quot; or mozzie or james . &quot;
neither i , nor mozzie , nor james
will use the scanner for such a search .
little pinky @-@ swear action ?
moz , meet me at my place .
i got a way to find the evidence .
here is your surveillance watch du jour .
this is one an artisan might wear while sculpting .
keep those upgrades coming .
audio &apos;s good . i &apos;ve calibrated the scanner .
careful .
i &apos;ll keep it safe .
anklet .
no . let &apos;s leave it on .
this is an undercover operation .
bellmiere &apos;s an art forger . he &apos;s not airport security .
he won &apos;t be patting caffrey down .
standard procedure is to remove the anklet .
we &apos;re less than 500 yards away ,
and we &apos;ve ears on him with the watch .
would you stand up ?
there . you &apos;re a very talented con artist .
you &apos;ll figure out how to keep that covered .
no problem .
well , the views are impressive .
this high up in the empire state building --
location is everything .
that &apos;s exactly what i tell my customers --
i run an ice @-@ cream franchise .
security was a bear getting up here .
yeah . metal detectors in the lobby ,
cameras at the entries and exits ,
visitor registration and access @-@ control systems .
check @-@ in desk every floor -- it &apos;s very safe .
oh , yeah . i can imagine .
it would be next to impossible to sneak up , like , a ... i don &apos;t know --
a metal ... scanner or something .
now , that office is directly below .
does that pose any noise problems ?
no . they &apos;ve got 20 @-@ foot ceilings ,
and we &apos;ve got three inches of marble .
i think you have something on your shoe .
oh , my . oh , my . i am so sorry .
w @-@ what is this ?
no -- stop .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
yeah , hi . i &apos;m gonna need the marble buffed on the rental floor .
no . this afternoon -- before the next showing .
thanks .
all right .
listen , if you don &apos;t mind . i like to work alone .
just ... part of my process .
i &apos;m the same way .
i &apos;m gonna go grab some coffee .
i always wondered when we &apos;d go out for ice cream .
mozzie calls it &quot; mint chocolate tracking chip . &quot;
all right , i re @-@ set the scanner
so that the tracking signal won &apos;t reach the van .
perfect .
ah , here comes our custodial accomplice .
harv &apos;s the man they call .
is he o.c.d. ?
yeah , that &apos;s what makes him so thorough .
loves dogs . has a niece named daisy ,
right ?
you got it .
&apos;scuse me !
&apos;scuse me .
yeah ?
uh , sorry to bother you , but you ...
you seen a collie run by here ,
about yea big , got a magnificent brown coat ?
goes by the name of daisy ?
oh , no . daisy ?
yeah .
that &apos;s my niece &apos;s name .
no kidding ?
yeah .
well , i was walking her down fifth avenue .
she just up and ran away . just bolted -- just ran away .
does she have tags ?
&apos;course she &apos;s got tags ! you sure you haven &apos;t seen her ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen her .
no ? oh , man !
what a day to forget my glasses !
this could take a while .
i know how busy you are . you don &apos;t need to stay .
oh , i started in the field . i like being out here .
me , too .
it &apos;s been 45 minutes .
how do you know when we &apos;ve scanned the box ?
we won &apos;t until we take it back and match the results
to the floor plans and the dimensions of the box .
you guys ever run a con like this before ?
can &apos;t say i &apos;ve ever used a buffer
to run an x @-@ ray scanner across a floor .
that doesn &apos;t look good .
uh @-@ oh . we &apos;re having a technical difficulty .
the image is breaking up .
we lost it .
he finished 90 % of the floor .
let &apos;s hope the box is in there somewhere .
that scanner has to be completely intact
when i return it to the fbi .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m checking on caffrey . something &apos;s not right .
you &apos;re pulling up his tracking data ?
we can hear him .
we can hear chiseling . we can &apos;t hear him .
i can &apos;t tell you why ,
but i get the feeling caffrey &apos;s up to something .
denied .
i.t. must not have activated your i.d. yet .
type in yours .
okay .
hmm . must have made a typo .
i &apos;m pulling it up right now .
right where he &apos;s supposed to be .
all right , bellmiere &apos;s gone . i &apos;m scanning now .
what are you doing ?
oh , i was just ... looking at your handiwork again .
dubois &apos; handiwork .
stick to the ones in back .
all right .
here it is .
the calibration &apos;s off . it &apos;s completely unreadable .
yeah , i &apos;m pulling him out of here .
i &apos;m gonna get some fresh air .
you know what ?
the initial carving isn &apos;t working for me .
that &apos;s exactly how i did it for dubois .
didn &apos;t you tell him to abort ?
he was happy with that ?
yeah .
but he never let you finish one .
he obsessed over every detail .
yeah , and he made you start over .
several times , if i recall .
you have no idea .
oh , i do . i went through his notes .
he didn &apos;t want to destroy his work .
you left him no choice .
he had to start over because you weren &apos;t good enough .
oh , please . he never knew what he wanted .
he &apos;d start over ... 20 times .
he &apos;d blow everything up at the last minute
and leave me to fix it !
i made him what he is !
whenever you look at a dubois , you &apos;re lookin &apos; at me .
then why isn &apos;t your name on it ?
get him out of there !
he &apos;s going for a confession .
you hide behind his work , you live off his name ,
but without dubois , you &apos;re nothing .
you don &apos;t exist .
let &apos;s move .
i &apos;ll monitor from here .
fbi !
drop it ! drop that weapon !
okay ! okay ! thank god you &apos;re here .
this con artist , neal caffrey ,
just broke a $ 10 million sculpture .
it &apos;s a fake . i can prove it .
right there .
i stand corrected . you do exist .
you once told me every forger
finds a way to sign his own name .
mr. blatnik , why don &apos;t you come with us to the bureau ?
the sad thing is ,
you &apos;re more talented than dubois .
i wonder how this scanner got so scratched up .
must have fallen out of my pocket when he attacked me .
how &apos;d it go ?
oh , forensics confirmed it was a forgery ,
as well as the one he sold at the tibedaux .
that &apos;s great , but i was talking about the empire state building .
we found it .
you found it ?
mozzie found a rectangular object
the exact dimensions of ellen &apos;s evidence box
on the southwest side of the ceiling .
well , let &apos;s go get it !
no , there &apos;s nothing we can do tonight .
it &apos;s not easy access .
well , does peter know ?
no , not yet . i &apos;ll tell him tomorrow .
well , now that we know where it is ,
let me go get it , keep you two guys clean .
no , i can &apos;t do that to peter .
well , you just ran a con on him .
i &apos;m not doing this without him .
listen , you promised me that you weren &apos;t gonna do this .
he &apos;s been more of a father to me than you ever were .
we &apos;re doing this with peter .
okay . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
you asked me why i don &apos;t have original art ?
i &apos;ve had three different names
and a dozen different aliases because of you .
and to be an artist , you have to know who you are .
you &apos;re my son .
and i &apos;m very proud of that .
you know , neal was chiseling away for a long time ,
but i never actually saw any carving in evidence .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a reason .
you both agreed -- no detours .
we did .
i get it now .
what &apos;s that ?
why hughes approved so many of your unorthodox operations .
really ?
you gave me a big win , but i don &apos;t need anyone
looking into whatever it was caffrey was doing .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not that bad .
peter .
is any of this gonna blow back on me ?
no .
let &apos;s keep it that way .
you continue to give me more wins ,
and i will give your team everything it needs .
win @-@ win .
agent watson , did you find anything ?
scanner &apos;s damaged pretty badly .
i see that .
and scrubbed data off the hard drive .
were you able to recover any of it ?
about 20 % .
whoever used the scanner was searching a building .
take a look at this .
is that a serial number ?
yep . it &apos;s a cable junction box .
this particular model was used in only one place --
floors 33 to 61 of the empire state building .
thanks , agent watson .
thank you .
oh , will you shut the door on your way out ?
senator pratt , please .
amanda callaway .
i think i may have your answer .
