can you believe it &apos;s been five years since our first date ?
i know .
do you think i should start watching the flash tv show ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking about ?
well , one of the things .
are any of them me ?
yes .
i thought , &quot; i can &apos;t decide if i should watch the flash tv show .
i know , i &apos;ll ask amy . &quot;
anyway ...
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re right , you did kind of kill the mood .
i didn &apos;t kill anything .
you did , talking about your stupid tv show .
excuse me .
starting to watch a television show that might run for years
isn &apos;t a decision to take lightly .
i &apos;m wrestling with a big commitment issue here .
really ?
that &apos;s the commitment issue you &apos;re wrestling with ?
sheldon ,
do you understand the irony
of your fixation on a man with super speed ,
while after five years all i can get out of you
is a distracted make @-@ out session on a couch ?
irony &apos;s not really my strong suit .
but i have been getting better with sarcasm ,
if you want to give that a try .
oh , sure , i &apos;d love to .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
i don &apos;t want to rush you ,
but i &apos;m closing a little early tonight .
ooh . hot date ?
uh , no . i overheard bernadette tell howard
she was making him a meat loaf ,
and you don &apos;t have to not ask me twice .
if i stick a lightbulb on this ,
wouldn &apos;t it make a great lamp for my bedroom ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
oh . is this freaking you out ?
i guess i &apos;m just more of a pottery barn ,
crate and barrel kind of guy .
maybe pier 1 if i really want to cut loose .
all right . never mind .
no , no , no . hey , you should totally get it .
in fact , i &apos;ll buy it for you .
sold !
raj , you don &apos;t have to do that .
too late ! no returns !
that was really intense .
well , now we know , next time we go to the farmers &apos; market ,
the order is petting zoo first , then buy vegetables .
oh , good . you &apos;re here . i need your assistance .
can it wait until i put a band @-@ aid on a goat bite ?
what happened ?
your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals .
been there .
so what do you need help with ?
amy &apos;s mad at me , and i &apos;m not clear why .
okay . were you talking before she got upset ?
yes .
that &apos;s probably it .
what &apos;d you say to her ?
well , i just asked her if i should start watching
the new flash tv series .
and that made her angry ?
baffling , right ?
we were necking like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers .
i stopped so i could ask the question .
next thing i know , good @-@ bye , kissy face . hello , yelly face .
well , sheldon , when you &apos;re kissing a girl ,
she expects the attention to be on her .
it was . i asked her
if she thought i should watch the flash .
yeah . i &apos;m tapping out . leonard ?
i &apos;m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment
of watching an entire season of a new show .
oh , no , not just a season .
if i &apos;m in , i &apos;m in for the whole run ,
even if the quality declines .
i get it . smallville almost wrecked you .
exactly .
you know , i waited ten years
to see a guy everyone knows can fly , fly .
wait , what is wrong with you two ?
he was talking about television during their date night .
oh , not just date night-- our fifth anniversary .
okay , see , that &apos;s even dumber than you wondering
if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat .
if that happens , don &apos;t make me wait ten years
to watch you eat a tin can .
you guys ever notice that emily has a bit of a twisted side ?
you mean &apos; cause she has weird tattoos ?
no , because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard .
one more time ?
she and i were supposed to watch
the new avengers movie tonight , but it was sold out .
so i said , &quot; what else do you want to do ? &quot;
she said , &quot; let &apos;s go to a cemetery
and do it on somebody &apos;s grave . &quot;
like , a random person or somebody she knew ?
what difference does it make ?
well , if it &apos;s her father &apos;s grave and they didn &apos;t get along ,
then you know she holds a grudge .
the only issue is that everybody has their own thing .
and as long as it &apos;s two consenting adults ,
i guess i don &apos;t see the harm in it .
well , what if it &apos;s one consenting adult
and one adult who pretends to consent
because he &apos;s afraid of being alone ?
well , then i guess bring a blanket .
the grass gets damp at night .
i don &apos;t know , guys .
maybe this relationship isn &apos;t for me .
maybe i should break up with her .
right . you &apos;re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you .
can you believe this guy ?
i think if raj wants to break up with a girl , he can do it .
how are you saying that with a straight face ?
i don &apos;t know .
you guys are being jerks .
buddy , other than jenny craig ,
you &apos;ve never broken up with a girl in your life .
you &apos;re one to talk .
you &apos;ve been complaining about stuart
living here for the past year .
i don &apos;t see you showing him the door .
that &apos;s not the same thing .
emily &apos;s a person .
stuart &apos;s more like an infestation ,
something you spray for .
baloney , okay ? you two are as afraid of
hurting someone &apos;s feelings as i am .
that &apos;s not true . we were just laughing right in your face .
thanks for cooking .
my pleasure .
that carrot was delicious .
yeah .
i wish i &apos;d fought harder for the rest of &apos; em .
still haven &apos;t heard from her ?
no , and i &apos;m confused .
it &apos;s been nearly 24 hours .
amy should have figured out she &apos;s wrong by now .
hey , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s wrong
about you going too slow in the relationship .
too slow ?
yeah , you &apos;ve been going out for years .
you haven &apos;t even slept together .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s called foreplay .
and i could make the case
that you two aren &apos;t moving forward in your relationship .
uh , hello .
hello .
no . sheldon , we &apos;re getting married .
but you &apos;ve been engaged for over a year now ,
and you don &apos;t even have a wedding date .
well , we will . we &apos;re just not in a rush .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna set a date .
okay . if you say so .
yeah , it &apos;s just , things are good right now .
really good .
i &apos;m focusing on my job .
and we &apos;ve been busy with our paper .
so busy .
yeah , we &apos;ll pick a date when we pick a date .
yeah .
okay .
you know , i can see why amy &apos;s mad at you .
yeah , shut up , sheldon !
did you eat all my yogurt ?
you mean the one that makes ladies do the thing
that ladies pretend they don &apos;t do
even though they do ?
you know ...
which yogurt i mean .
i didn &apos;t touch it . must have been stuart .
maybe raj is right .
maybe it &apos;s time we tell him he needs to move out .
we should have done it months ago .
i know , but his store was reopening ,
and then there were the holidays , and then he was sick .
yeah , right .
sick . he didn &apos;t have jaundice .
he just looks like that .
all right . tonight &apos;s the night .
agreed .
when he gets home , i &apos;m dropping the hammer .
ooh , i like when you take charge .
oh , i &apos;m not taking charge-- you &apos;re the hammer .
so ...
why haven &apos;t we picked a date ?
you know why .
well , of course i know why .
but just for fun ... why ?
not in a rush , busy with work ...
things are good right now .
really good .
you still want to get married , right ?
oh , my god . yes . why would you even ask that ?
i don &apos;t know . because we don &apos;t have a date ?
well , you want a date , pick a date .
it &apos;s not just the date .
we haven &apos;t talked about anything .
big wedding , small wedding , indoor , outdoor ...
outdoor ? oh .
i can rsvp no right now .
okay , indoor it is . big or small ?
is your dad paying for it ?
i doubt it .
okay , two friends each .
all right , well , i want it in a church .
fine . i want black @-@ tie .
fine . i want to release butterflies .
seriously ? airborne worms ?
okay . well , then it &apos;s settled :
small indoor church wedding , black @-@ tie , no butterflies .
sounds perfect .
great .
you still didn &apos;t pick a date .
stay out of it !
shut up !
it &apos;s a beautiful night .
oh , yes , we &apos;ve got the moon
and the trees and ...
elizabeth mcnulty ,
who apparently died when she was the same age i am .
makes you feel alive , doesn &apos;t it ?
so does enjoying a meal at a well @-@ lit restaurant ,
but here we are .
you aren &apos;t scared , are you ?
of ghosts , no .
of you , little bit .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ve upset you .
i shouldn &apos;t have asked so many questions .
no , it &apos;s okay .
yeah , maybe it &apos;s good you got us talking about this stuff .
well , look at that--
even when i &apos;m causing problems , i make the world a better place .
hey , next , why don &apos;t we tackle your penchant for whining
and penny &apos;s love of the ol &apos; glug @-@ glug ?
uh , sheldon , i think we &apos;re good for now .
ah , well ... very well .
so does this mean you &apos;ll finally pick a wedding date ?
here we go again .
why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date ?
we &apos;re committed to each other . we &apos;re happy .
a ceremony isn &apos;t gonna change anything .
so you &apos;re never getting married ?
it &apos;s his whining , isn &apos;t it ?
sheldon , i &apos;m not a whiner .
it &apos;s amusing that he doesn &apos;t hear it .
look , all she &apos;s saying is we are in love
so it doesn &apos;t matter if we get married tomorrow
or a year from now or 50 years from now .
ew , 50 ? we &apos;ll be old and gross .
yeah , but we &apos;ll be old and gross together .
my aunt and uncle were married 63 years .
towards the end , it was like watching cheese melt .
um ... i &apos;m free tonight .
are you saying you want to get married ?
vegas isn &apos;t that far away .
i &apos;m in . let &apos;s do it .
after all these years .
i &apos;m really happy for the two of you .
oh , thank you .
thanks .
now get out of my spot .
bernie , stuart just pulled up .
so remember ,
the key is to be firm .
show no weakness .
right .
good luck .
howard joel wolowitz , you get back here .
never should have told you my middle name .
hey , guys .
hey , you got a minute ?
sure . uh , let me just put this stuff in the fridge .
i felt bad for finishing your yogurt , so i bought more .
and , howard , your favorite fruit is in season .
crunch berries .
don &apos;t let that sway you .
it &apos;s hard not to .
they taste so much better than real berries .
what &apos;s up ?
so ... we need to talk .
you okay ?
i think we should talk .
is everything okay ?
well ... you &apos;ve been living here a while now .
i know . i may sell comic books at work ,
but the real superheroes
are sitting right in front of me .
yeah ...
his middle name is david . go .
look , i care about you a lot ,
but we are very different people .
are you breaking up with me ?
no , no , i &apos;m just pointing out that
you &apos;re dark on the inside and i &apos;m dark on the outside .
so , anyway , what i &apos;m trying to say is ...
you need to take that ?
it &apos;s just my dad , probably calling
to wish me a happy birthday .
i &apos;ll call him back .
you were saying ?
look , raj , be honest with me .
if you want to end things , just do it .
don &apos;t expect me to do it for you .
end things ? i &apos;m trying to tell you that i love you .
* happy birthday to you . *
wow , there &apos;s a denny &apos;s in vegas
you can actually get married in .
doesn &apos;t sound very romantic .
yeah , but we could get heart @-@ shaped pancakes .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find a decent chapel .
yeah .
this is crazy !
i know !
you think people are gonna be mad ?
maybe . but this isn &apos;t about them ; it &apos;s about us .
it is . it is about us .
and you know what the best part is ?
we took our time .
i mean , we met , we were friends for a couple years ,
then we got together , and then we got untogether ,
then we worked out all our problems ,
and now we know everything about each other ,
we can just go forward
with no surprises and no regrets .
right . no surprises .
and no regrets .
uh , well , there @-@ there &apos;s one thing
i feel i should tell you .
what ?
you know , so we can go into this
with no secrets between us .
what ?
remember , uh , a couple years back
when i was on that research ship in the north sea ?
yeah .
okay , well , there @-@ there was a lot of drinking
and craziness going on ...
no , you told me .
okay , um ...
well , there was this girl .
what did you do ?
nothing ...
really .
it was just kissing .
and then what ?
and then nothing .
i stopped it .
but it still bothers me , and ...
i wanted you to know .
all right .
did you ever do anything like this since we &apos;ve been ... ?
nope , never .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
you know , can i ask you a question ?
why are you telling me this now ?
well , like i said , we &apos;re about to get married ,
and i @-@ i want a clean slate .
no secrets .
really ? be @-@ because to me ,
it seems like we &apos;re about to get married
and you &apos;re trying to sabotage it .
w @-@ would you rather i didn &apos;t tell you ?
no , i don &apos;t want there to be secrets between us .
see , now i &apos;m confused .
i mean , what @-@ what am i supposed to do ?
uh , keep your mouth off other women .
i can do that .
uh , uh , f @-@ from now on ,
this mouth-- you and food , that &apos;s it .
okay .
yeah ?
look , i &apos;m not happy this happened ,
but i think i can get past it .
i mean , we weren &apos;t engaged at the time ,
and it was just kissing .
right .
just kissing .
it wasn &apos;t even very good .
she was a smoker . i &apos;d just been seasick ...
okay , that &apos;s enough . stop talking .
so ...
we &apos;re still getting married ?
yes .
because we love each other .
yes .
and it &apos;s the happiest day of our lives .
don &apos;t push it .
hello .
hello .
listen , i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about relationships
and how difficult they can be , and i think ...
i &apos;ve been thinking about them , too , sheldon .
being your girlfriend is so challenging .
emotionally ,
physically .
i &apos;ve been incredibly patient for years .
strongly disagree .
go on .
okay , well ...
this isn &apos;t easy to say , because i love you ,
but ...
i need some time to take a step back
and reevaluate our situation .
i hope you understand .
okay .
bye , sheldon .
well , gollum ...
... you &apos;re an expert on rings .
what do i do with this one ?
