turn it off .
she &apos;s ruthless without her humanity .
i &apos;m done playing nice .
i guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this .
that &apos;s emotion , elena .
silas is psychic . he can get into people &apos;s heads ,
read their minds , make them see things that aren &apos;t really there .
silas wants me to drop the veil
between our side and the other side .
he wants to take the cure and then he wants to die .
i said i &apos;d help him and i &apos;ve been hiding from him ever since .
what did i do ? i almost killed him .
matt . i almost-- no ! no !
emotions are overwhelming you .
you just have to focus on one thing , ok ?
i did . i focused on hate .
even if you spend 10 minutes of your life hating her , she wins .
not if i kill her .
and ?
that did nothing for me .
how was it for you ?
again .
good . now .
focus on letting it go .
or we could skip the sublimating part
and you can tell me where she is
so that i can rip her head off .
i don &apos;t know where katherine is
and even if i did , i wouldn &apos;t tell you .
stefan , you &apos;re the one who told me to channel all of my emotions
into one single feeling .
i realize that . i just figured it would be love ,
or hope , or compassion .
not unwavering hatred for a ruthless vampire
that &apos;s 500 years older than you .
well ?
give me 50 pull @-@ ups .
you wanted to kill klaus when you got your emotions back .
i know , and i couldn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t think i can kill katherine ?
i don &apos;t think you really want to .
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i just want to feel the warmth of her chest cavity
as i rip out her heart
and watch her face as she realizes
i took it from her .
nah , i just want to kill her .
it &apos;s that simple .
i &apos;m gonna go shower .
so , let me get this straight .
you send out a notice of your impending graduation ,
and people feel obliged to give you money ?
pretty much .
sounds brilliant .
why aren &apos;t you participating ?
i don &apos;t have a whole lot of family .
well , that makes two of us .
besides , i don &apos;t think it was my mother &apos;s dream
to see me in a cap and gown .
how about your mom ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m not holding my breath for a graduation check .
stamp , please .
thank you .
you don &apos;t have to pretend to be nice to me , caroline .
i know this is just a ploy to keep me distracted .
you &apos;re done ? i &apos;m only on my second batch .
we have family friends in denver .
other than that ,
no one cares that i &apos;m graduating .
and to be honest , neither do i.
you know , that &apos;s how you feel now ,
but once you get through this hating katherine phase--
wait . do you know where katherine is ?
no . why would i know where she is ?
yeah , but caroline , if you did , you would tell me , right ?
elena , you &apos;re obsessing .
caroline , listen to me .
if you know where katherine is ,
you have to tell me .
i don &apos;t . elena ... chill .
hello !
could you be any creepier ?
why are we here ?
you want me to make you truly immortal
so that nothing can kill you .
to do that , i need to talk to qetsiyah ,
which means i need to lower the veil to the other side .
that still doesn &apos;t explain why you made me trudge through mud
in $ 500 boots .
a few miles that way ,
12 hybrids were killed at the lockwood cellar .
and a few miles that way , 12 humans died at the young farm .
and this is the site where 12 witches were killed .
13 if you don &apos;t get to the point .
it &apos;s the expression triangle .
i need to charge all 3 points
and channel the mystical energy from silas &apos;s tombstone .
once that happens , i can drop the veil inside the 3 points
and just long enough to get what i need .
and what exactly do you need ?
silas has done nothing but torment my friends .
now he wants to unleash hell on earth .
he &apos;s evil . in 2,000 years ,
only one person has been able to put him down .
let me guess . qetsiyah .
if i can contact her ,
i can ask her how to do it .
now hand me the rock .
you &apos;re gonna flood mystic falls
with dead , supernatural creatures
so that you can ask a 2,000 @-@ year @-@ old witch
not one but two favors ? ha !
i think i &apos;ll take my business elsewhere .
what the hell ?
i linked us .
which means you &apos;re stuck with me for the day .
silas can be anyone .
if he gets in your head and figures out
i don &apos;t need a full moon to do the spell ,
it &apos;s over .
now , about that tombstone .
you just missed the donuts .
yeah , i was with elena
burning off a few thousand hate @-@ filled calories .
what happened to you helping me ?
help ? yes .
prolonging the inevitable , waste of my time .
hmm . you &apos;re avoiding .
how unexpected .
i &apos;m not avoiding .
elena &apos;s only goal is to end katherine &apos;s life ,
and that &apos;s not gonna just magically disappear
with pilates and a juice cleanse .
hey , guys . thanks for coming .
why were we invited ?
well , the hospital has kept the blood banks empty
ever since they were raided last month .
we thought at the very least ,
it would help keep the vampire population away .
and it didn &apos;t ?
see for yourself .
there were 4 other victims in this wing .
each one almost completely drained of blood .
you think it &apos;s silas ?
or a doctor with some very questionable bedside manner .
but 5 victims ?
it &apos;s a lot of blood and it &apos;s not like he can take it with him .
unless he &apos;s fueling up for something big .
big ? any details would be helpful ,
considering i &apos;m dealing with 5 grieving families out there
and a psychic killer on the loose .
silas wants bonnie to do a spell to drop the veil from the other side .
i have no idea what that means .
it &apos;s an invisible wall that separates our plane
from the plane of all dead supernatural creatures .
now , silas wants that to go away
so he can take the cure , die ,
and not have to spend an eternity in a supernatural purgatory .
and when do you suppose silas plans on doing this ?
next full moon . tomorrow night .
ugh . that old lockwood cellar reeks of wet dog .
i &apos;ll be staying up here .
you obviously don &apos;t know how this works .
you realize i &apos;m not just some wandering child in a supermarket , right ?
i &apos;m a vampire that can kill you .
whatever happens to me happens to you .
do you really think i want you here ?
and what is here ? oh . right .
12 dead hybrids . this should be good .
is it supposed to rain tonight ?
do i look like a meteorologist ?
someone needs to do something ,
before she explodes .
i got this .
drink .
you &apos;re putting everyone on edge .
so . what &apos;s the deal ?
i &apos;m new to this whole emotional switch situation .
it &apos;s not complicated . see that dart board ?
all i can picture is katherine &apos;s face .
so , your emotions are on , they &apos;re just dialed to rage .
look , rebekah , i get that we had our thelma and louise thing
back when i had my humanity off ,
but let me make one thing clear--
we &apos;re not friends .
ok .
what about us ? are we still friends ?
all those things you said when your humanity was off ,
is that how you really feel ?
caroline , i really don &apos;t feel like going down memory lane .
well , what about when you said ,
and i quote , &quot; you &apos;re a repulsive ,
blood @-@ sucking , control freak monster &quot; ?
did you really mean those things ?
if you &apos;re waiting for an apology , you &apos;re not gonna get one .
i can &apos;t let myself feel bad ,
because if i feel bad , then i feel everything , and ...
we &apos;ve all seen how well i handle that .
the power &apos;s completely out .
i &apos;ll call my mom !
maybe she knows what &apos;s going on .
12 humans burned to death here .
they died in vain for silas .
what did you do ?
i linked the final hot spot .
it &apos;s time to drop the veil .
the power outages originated at 3 different places in town--
the young farm , the lockwood estate ,
and a blown transformer off old miller road .
these are the locations of the silas massacres .
it &apos;s the expression triangle .
bonnie must be doing the spell .
so much for needing a full moon .
i know something else .
one of the power company guys
has a daughter who goes to school with bonnie .
he saw her leaving the young farm an hour ago .
with elena .
but caroline &apos;s with elena .
looks like bonnie bennett has a new doppelganger friend .
so , how do we find them ?
well , they must be somewhere in the triangle .
my guess is right in the middle .
and where exactly might that be ?
where &apos;s caroline ?
inside looking for bonnie .
i think we should split up .
damon and i can look outside while you and caroline look inside .
all right . let me know if you find anything .
someone &apos;s an eager beaver .
where &apos;s katherine ?
now i get it .
one brother shoots you down ,
you ask the other one . great .
you know , don &apos;t you ?
do you not notice all the end of the world crap going on right now ?
tell me that you don &apos;t want her dead .
after everything that she did to you .
stringing you along for hundreds of years .
elena , we don &apos;t need to list all the reasons that i hate katherine .
what we need to do is find bonnie . come on .
i don &apos;t care about bonnie .
i care about killing katherine .
they &apos;re together .
ok ?
so maybe you should do a little less threatening
and a little more looking .
come on .
hey . there you are . any luck ?
i searched the whole school .
she should be here .
what was that ?
hmm . ice is melting .
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
this is the center of the triangle .
if she &apos;s gonna do the spell ,
she has to do it here .
this is where they should be .
actually , i think we &apos;re in the right place .
just the wrong elevation .
ok . this is the center of the triangle .
i &apos;m ready .
now give me the tombstone .
the fact that this spell hinges on some crappy hunk of blood @-@ rock
does little to inspire my confidence .
it &apos;s filled with the calcified blood of qetsiyah ,
one of the strongest witches in the world .
it &apos;ll work .
if i remember correctly ,
i think there &apos;s an entrance in the basement .
where &apos;s the basement ?
off the boiler room .
you hear that ?
all right . i &apos;ll meet you there .
what ?
you &apos;re gonna have to stay here .
are you kidding me ?
we really need to stop bonnie from doing this spell ,
and if you get all murderous and screw it up--
is that really the reason ?
as self @-@ righteous as stefan is ,
he has a point .
behind your rage , there is a tidal wave of feelings .
all of your guilt ,
all your grief .
every emotion you &apos;ve ever put off .
and killing katherine &apos;s gonna let it all in ,
and if you can &apos;t handle it ,
then we &apos;re back to square one .
and if i can ?
what if killing katherine takes away all that grief and guilt ?
what if killing katherine
finally lets me feel all the good things that i &apos;ve lost ?
damon , help me .
as soon as i get over this hurdle , i &apos;ll be me .
i &apos;ll be able to think clearly .
i &apos;ll be myself and everything will go back to normal .
she &apos;s strong . and crafty . and you &apos;ll die .
then at least i &apos;ll die trying .
what is happening ?
i &apos;m channeling the expression triangle .
it &apos;s done .
the veil is down .
need a hand ?
so , this is either really good or really bad .
it &apos;s good to see you , too , damon .
i &apos;d say the feeling was mutual ,
except a lot of people aren &apos;t exactly
who they say they are around here .
you think i &apos;m silas ? are you kidding me ?
see , this puts us in a bit of a pickle ,
cause that is exactly what silas would say .
now , would silas know about locker 42 ?
hang on .
if i can see you , and i can touch you ,
that means the little witch did it .
she dropped the veil .
not completely .
it &apos;s only down inside the expression triangle .
if i step outside of it , it &apos;s
back to ghost world .
where &apos;s everybody ? i figure with the veil down ,
it &apos;d be like ghost @-@ a @-@ palooza .
not every ghost has a reason to come back to mystic falls .
just the ones like me ,
looking out for their idiot best friends .
i &apos;m more worried about the ones looking out for their enemies .
this wind is weird .
one minute it was blowing like a hurricane .
now nothing , not even a breeze .
looks like something wicked finally came .
you know , you don &apos;t have to be here .
i mean , technically , only one of us is getting paid .
but it &apos;s fun . and kind of cozy .
with the storm outside and the candlelight .
and us .
my god . kol .
greetings from the dead . so , who fancies a drink ?
i thought i &apos;d never see you again .
spare me the waterworks , sister .
i &apos;ve already watched you grieve .
lasted a full 24 hours , remember ?
i &apos;m assuming this means bonnie dropped the veil .
not completely , and not for long .
but who am i to give up an opportunity for revenge ?
my killer &apos;s already dead ,
but his sister &apos;s just as culpable .
so maybe you could help me find her .
if you hurt elena--
i &apos;m going to .
but please , continue . i &apos;m curious as to where you &apos;re going with this .
you &apos;ve made your point , kol . leave .
first tell me where i can find elena .
she left here hours ago .
we don &apos;t know where she is . now get out .
i see you finally got the quarterback to pay attention to you .
how &apos;s the throwing arm , champ ?
tick tock , bonnie .
stop talking .
i can &apos;t reach out to qetsiyah with you
breaking my concentration every 5 seconds .
bonnie . did you hear that ?
someone &apos;s coming .
will you be quiet ?
i have vampire hearing , bonnie ,
and there &apos;s someone here .
unlink me so that i can go stall them
while we wait for qetsiyah to show up .
i &apos;m not letting you go .
then at least give me some slack .
fine . go . stop them .
silas ?
come and get me .
hello , katherine .
i let you out of your cage
and this is how you thank me ?
no . this is how i thank you .
bonnie . bonnie , what happened ?
katherine . find katherine . we &apos;re linked .
then unlink her .
you go . i &apos;ll stay with bonnie .
you have done nothing but suck the happiness out of my life .
well , now i get to kill you .
no , wait , please .
good @-@ bye , katherine .
stefan !
thanks for the save , handsome .
get the hell out of here before i kill you myself .
really ? i &apos;m your biggest problem right now ?
you know , i could just cure this for you easily , right ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
why won &apos;t you ever let me help you ?
it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s ...
look , people in this town
have a bad habit of turning into vampires
and i &apos;d like to graduate high school as a human .
i think there &apos;s a first aid kit in the back .
ok .
caroline , how are you still here--
oh , my god .
i have to keep cutting .
bonnie , are you ok ?
yeah , now that i unlinked her .
what are you doing down here ?
waiting for qetsiyah .
you might be waiting a while .
qetsiyah &apos;s not coming , bonnie .
silas .
but--i saw caroline . how ?
i thought you couldn &apos;t get inside my head .
that &apos;s what i wanted you to think .
i can make you see whatever i want you to see .
am i a disfigured monster ?
of course not .
a monster is what i wanted you to see .
that &apos;s the beauty of all this .
you have no idea who i am .
or what i look like .
or how deep i am inside of your head .
you thought that you were more powerful than me ?
i &apos;m stronger than you can imagine .
i defeated the hunter &apos;s curse in minutes .
you thought that you could betray me .
you can &apos;t . i will always be one step ahead .
how could you save her ?
she was as good as dead .
yeah , and so was bonnie .
bonnie used a spell to link herself to katherine ,
so if you killed her , bonnie would be dead , too ,
how do you know that ?
because i saw her , elena .
you almost killed your best friend .
i don &apos;t believe you .
really ?
you never wanted me to kill katherine .
why are you protecting her , stefan ?
listen to yourself . your rage is making you crazy .
do you still have feelings for her ?
this isn &apos;t even about katherine .
this is about jeremy .
what , you think that killing her
will take all that pain away ?
it won &apos;t .
oh , but beating up cinder blocks will ?
no . it &apos;s a distraction .
just like killing katherine ,
just like turning your emotions off .
the truth is , there are no shortcuts .
you are a vampire , elena .
loss is part of the deal .
look , i &apos;ve been alive for 163 years .
i have lost more loved ones than i can count
and it hurts me every single time .
so , there &apos;s no hope .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m hopeless .
no . i &apos;m saying you have to face your grief .
but you don &apos;t have to do it alone . i can help you .
oh , of course you can . god , stefan ,
always trying to help and your concern for me is just like--
you &apos;re transferring your rage onto me . that &apos;s good .
i don &apos;t need to transfer anything .
i can hate two people just fine .
just like the cinder block . nothing .
caroline , hey , snap out of it .
i need to bleed .
silas wants me to bleed .
stop it . you &apos;re hallucinating .
just let me do this . i need to do this .
you &apos;re gonna cut your hands off .
she &apos;s been here the whole time .
that means silas is with you .
perfect .
yeah , it gets worse .
the veil &apos;s down .
kol came by looking for elena .
seemed a little pissed .
do you have any good news for me , donovan ?
we &apos;ll handle this . just ... watch your back .
call stefan . tell him about caroline .
tell him to keep an eye on elena .
god knows he &apos;ll do a better job than me .
stefan ? isn &apos;t she your girlfriend ?
who knows ? i know she was sired to me .
i know her emotions were off .
i know she &apos;s so full of rage
she wants to rip katherine &apos;s head off--
but you have no idea how she feels about you
and now you &apos;re freaking out .
call stefan .
let go of me !
have you tried compelling her ?
i can &apos;t . she &apos;s on vervain .
let me go !
look , caroline , you &apos;re graduating
and uncle bob and aunt mary
really want you to graduate with both your hands .
i need to keep cutting . i need to keep cutting .
i need to keep cutting .
stop !
bitch !
that is the caroline i know and loathe .
stay away from me .
gladly .
once you finish the spell .
then when the veil is dropped completely ,
i can take the cure .
i just want to pass on , bonnie .
i &apos;ll even let you kill me .
i &apos;ll be out of your life for good .
but every dead supernatural creature
will be roaming the earth .
well , if you don &apos;t help me ,
i &apos;ll be roaming the earth .
i was never gonna drop the veil .
i &apos;m curious . what was your plan ?
pow @-@ wow with qetsiyah ?
brainstorm ways to put me down ?
qetsiyah &apos;s not coming .
she wants me on the other side with her .
for eternity .
bonnie ? bonnie ?
that sounds familiar .
maybe damon will convince you .
i won &apos;t let you--
you won &apos;t let me what ?
you feel that , bonnie ?
the air . thinning .
barely enough to breathe .
&quot; brother and friend &quot; ?
what genius came up with that one ?
i give up , jer .
i really wanted to kill her for you , but ...
there &apos;s no point . stefan &apos;s right .
it &apos;s just a distraction . and ...
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t--
i can &apos;t move on ,
and i don &apos;t want to .
if that makes me weak , then fine , i &apos;m weak .
but i can &apos;t handle you ...
you being gone ...
and i can &apos;t handle feeling like this anymore .
hello , old friend .
pity about your brother .
guess it &apos;s just me against you now .
bonnie .
this isn &apos;t real , bonnie .
feel the air in your lungs .
break through .
silas ?
would silas try and save your life ?
now , breathe , child .
there .
i was so worried about you .
i know .
but i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;ve been watching over you .
i messed up .
i &apos;m sorry .
you can still stop silas .
no , i can &apos;t .
qetsiyah was able to immobilize him
so he couldn &apos;t feed and get into people &apos;s heads .
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
i don &apos;t know how to put him down .
you can do that .
expression is the manifestation of your will .
you can do anything .
i don &apos;t like it , but sometimes , there are no choices .
but you are strong enough .
you can do this .
whoa . it &apos;s just me .
i called stefan . he &apos;s heading for elena .
did you find silas ?
yup .
oh ! damon , it &apos;s me !
no , you &apos;re not .
i &apos;ve spent more time in these tunnels than i care to admit
and there &apos;s no way you just came from the school .
your mind games don &apos;t work on me , silas .
i may not be able to kill you ,
but i will stop you .
i will make the blood clot in your veins .
i will make every bone , muscle , and joint
in your body turn to stone .
you won &apos;t have power over us anymore .
what the hell is happening ?
he can &apos;t hide behind his mind control anymore .
he &apos;s becoming his true self .
who exactly might his true self be ?
i guess we &apos;ll never know .
now , this is what i &apos;ve missed .
two people connecting .
it &apos;s lonely on the other side .
i swear , being invisible will drive you mad .
the way you couldn &apos;t see me standing in front of you ,
or feel my breath on your cheek as i whispered
all the ways that i wished for you to suffer .
but alas , now you can .
go ahead , kol . kill me .
you &apos;ll be doing me a favor .
as you wish , darling .
how many times do i need to kill you ?
jeremy gilbert .
welcome back .
now , what &apos;s the saying ?
kill me once , shame on you ,
kill me twice , shame on--
let &apos;s leave it at that , shall we ?
elena ? elena !
jeremy .
you need to get rid of silas &apos; body .
well , there &apos;s a slight problem , medusa .
even though you turned him into stone ,
if he gets one more drop of blood ,
he &apos;s back to his old mind tricks .
all right , so , let &apos;s do what we should &apos;ve done to klaus .
let &apos;s drop his body in the middle of the ocean .
bonnie ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i was so horrible to you .
you weren &apos;t you .
i know what that &apos;s like .
i wasn &apos;t me for a long time .
we can talk about that later .
you got some catching up to do .
thank you , bonnie .
i &apos;ll give you guys as much time as i can ...
but i have to go put the veil back up .
i should make sure kol &apos;s body is somewhere safe
until the veil goes back up .
stefan , wait .
welcome back .
there isn &apos;t enough time .
it &apos;ll never be enough time .
damon , i &apos;m sorry .
stop .
the most important thing right now is jeremy .
and saying good @-@ bye .
good . you &apos;re here .
we need to celebrate .
yeah . i &apos;m not really in the mood to ... celebrate .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
silas is dead , or whatever ,
and you &apos;re just sitting here like a bump on a log .
there was someone that i thought i would see today ,
and ... i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s all .
you better mean me .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
thank you for keeping an eye on this one .
calcified silas is a heavy son of a bitch .
can &apos;t think of a more appropriate way
to spend my last moment as a semi @-@ living person .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you have someplace better to be ?
guess not .
thought you were cutting back .
yeah , well ...
i thought you were gonna take care of the children .
you heard that ?
that &apos;s not creepy .
i ... found this in the dead guy &apos;s pocket .
thought it might do more use here than , say ,
3 miles below sea level .
what the hell am i supposed to do with this ?
get the girl .
she punched you in the face ?
yup .
take a hint .
so , you &apos;ve been back what , 5 minutes ,
and you &apos;re already laughing at me ?
no . i &apos;ve been laughing at you for a while .
you just haven &apos;t been able to see me .
do you have any idea how much i missed you ?
trust me . i do .
although i see i &apos;ve been replaced by another blonde .
what &apos;d you give me that look for ?
she &apos;s cute .
do not start .
you have to put up the veil .
not yet .
what are you doing , bonnie ?
i can bring jeremy back .
i can keep him here .
no , you can &apos;t .
elena needs him . this was always the plan .
jeremy wasn &apos;t supposed to die .
it was the will of nature .
there is no magic in this world
that is strong enough to challenge it .
i have every magic .
i have the spirits .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
stop it !
i have expression .
stop it , bonnie .
and i have the darkness .
bonnie , don &apos;t .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
in case caroline didn &apos;t thank you
for pulling her out of that hallucination earlier ... thanks .
i &apos;m just glad i got a chance to knock her upside the face .
oh , my god .
who the hell is that ?
that is my ex @-@ boyfriend alexander .
he &apos;s a vampire hunter .
thank god . the power &apos;s coming back .
maybe that means the veil &apos;s almost up
and he &apos;ll disappear again .
or not .
we should get out of here .
you should .
too bad you can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , bonnie .
the spell . it was just too much .
oh , my god .
