i &apos;m max . i &apos;ll be your waitress ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t do background checks here .
oh , you &apos;ll be our waitress . i never guessed that
based on the uniform and name tag that says &quot; max . &quot;
you know i make , like , $ 3 , right ?
i realize that &apos;s a lot of money in the 1920s
where you two are from .
here , open this and bring us two clean glasses .
sure , not @-@ so @-@ great gatsby .

hey , oj and nicole .
丈夫是黑人 妻子是白人
rude snobs at table ten . you know what that means .
wine swap ?
let &apos;s roll .
hey , oleg , i need one of those $ 2 merlots
you get from your cousin with the hole in his neck .
caroline , price check .
oh ! chateau pavie , 2008 . very expensive .
but , hey , we deserve it .
here , better let it breathe .
it was in my gym bag .
not a problem .
this vintage pairs well with jockstrap .
do you think waitresses did this to me when i had money ?
only if you had an attitude .
so that &apos;s a yes .
i can &apos;t remember if this reminds me
of an old heist movie i saw
or an old heist i actually participated in .
i know . we &apos;re like ocean &apos;s 7 @-@ 11 .
all we &apos;re missing is a tiny asian guy
钻入行李车中躲藏的桥段
who can fit into small boxes .
hello .
table ten is looking for their wine .
oh , not a problem . coming right up .
what did you do ? why is she smiling ?
are my pants on fire again ?
oh , yeah , take that , sucker !
max , when i said we need to move the cupcakes ,
i didn &apos;t mean through the air at a rodent &apos;s head .
hey , he ran up the window ,
so it &apos;s kind of a stand @-@ your @-@ ground situation .
允许民众在没有退路的情况下使用致命武力自卫
okay , we &apos;re on a time @-@ out .
he &apos;s eating my ammo .
max , business is down again ,
and the only phrase i &apos;ve said more than that is ,
&quot; please , god , take me in my sleep . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s clear . not getting ahead .
oh , is that what your mood is about ?
you &apos;re not getting any ahead ?
&apos;cause i can take care of that with one call .
you are not hooking me up with that guy
who &apos;s listed in your phone as &quot; oral redenbacher . &quot;
美国知名爆米花品牌的创办人 特别喜欢泡嫩妹
max , this is our future .
we need to get serious about making money .
absolutely . let &apos;s leave early .
leave early ? who are we , congress ?
do you think other business got successful by leaving early ?
no , they did it by hiring illegals
and moving their bank accounts offshore .
we can &apos;t leave early .
the sign says &quot; open till 2 : 00 a.m. &quot;
well , i &apos;m open to getting a new sign that says &quot; closed . &quot;
i mean , are we supposed to just hang around here
and wait for whatever nut jobs are trolling around town ?
hi , girls .
guess what oleg and i are going to do
that will probably give me hep c.
a three way with tommy lee ?
no , silly . we &apos;re getting matching tattoos .
感染丙型肝炎的风险很高
we want something that represents our relationship .
so maybe two butterflies
doing the nasty during &quot; csi : miami . &quot;
wow , you two , his and her tats .
romantic and will help identify the bodies .
sure , you know , matching tattoos
are the deepest expression of commitment .
well , matching tattoos
and pooping in front of each other .
i &apos;m not gonna do it in front of my man .
i poop at mcdonald &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m a lady .
thanks for the cupcake .
we really have to start charging her .
charge her with what , first @-@ degree man @-@ settling ?
max , as i was saying ,
it &apos;s time to get serious about the business .
absolutely . let &apos;s leave early .
what ? last night after 1 : 00,
we made only $ 15 , right ?
$ 14.63 .
what ? math is my thing .
would you roll your eyes if you were standing
也曾被誉为最伟大的饶舌歌手
across from eminem and he started rapping ?
uh , yes .
i &apos;d be all , &quot; dude , you &apos;re 60 .
sit on a porch swing . &quot;
okay , look , here is $ 15 .
that &apos;ll cover what we &apos;ll probably make .
i &apos;m leaving .
you &apos;re just gonna leave me here ?
yup , i &apos;m leaving as soon as i get my change back
from that $ 14.63 .
fine , just tell me how much that is .
or maybe sooner .
this is a very big day for me .
why , because of this totally out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ blue order
we got to do cupcakes for this business seminar ?
no , the first time i &apos;ve entered a sheridan through a door .
usually it &apos;s by window or freight elevator .
and one time , i rolled in under some girl &apos;s quinceanera dress .
the seminar &apos;s about to start .
i have unclaimed name tags for pamela , ellen ...
what kind of losers would come to this ?
max , caroline .
i wouldn &apos;t call us losers .
are you here ?
okay , so there is no cupcake order .
i signed us up for this seminar .
i carried cupcakes on a subway for nothing ?
the annoying woman next to me talked the whole time .
i was sitting next to you , max .
look , i knew you wouldn &apos;t come otherwise ,
and you need to be here .
this is a business intervention .
it &apos;s not an intervention .
max , your behavior lately has affected me
in the following ways .
i can &apos;t believe this .
at least in my other interventions i was drunk .
we need to do this seminar .
gordon kepper is a genius .
he &apos;s gonna give our business a real bump .
guys giving me a bump is why they threw me
that second intervention .
let &apos;s go .
oh , mm , okay . see you .
so this is your new thing , max ?
you &apos;re just gonna walk out on me ?
actually , it &apos;s an old thing .
in fact , it &apos;s kind of a family tradition .
i learned from my father , whoever he is .
come on . it &apos;s just two days .
two days ? no way .
no freaking way .
there &apos;s a buffet and a dessert bar .
ooh , okay .
wait here , i &apos;ll go pay . i brought some cash .
and they &apos;ll take an expired target gift card , right ?
oh , we are not paying .
here . here , pamela .
follow ellen to the freight elevator .
no way , max . we are not sneaking in .
how much is this thing ?
$ 1,000 .
we &apos;re sneaking in , ellen .
now , you all are here today
not only to find out what you are as a business
but to find out who you are .
i &apos;m a lady hoping there &apos;s macaroni and cheese at that buffet .
who are you is your brand ,
and saying that a brand is simply a name is like saying
abraham lincoln is simply a name ,
or mahatma gandhi , god .
who does this guy think he is ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re wondering , &quot; who does this guy think he is ? &quot;
okay , that was weird .
or maybe this seems weird .
i &apos;ve got chills .
when it comes to business , people come up to me all the time .
they say , &quot; gordon , business is hard ,
but i do what i can . &quot;
and they shrug . now , is that the right attitude ?
no .
yes .
to those people , i say , &quot; don &apos;t do what you can .
can what you do . &quot;
don &apos;t do what you can .
can what you do ! get it ? do you get it ?
yes .
no .
you did not get it .
all right , everybody , reach under your chairs
and pick up what you find there .
hope it &apos;s a way out of here .
koosh balls ?
inside those cans , you will find the key
to success in your business .
not unless the key is rosie o &apos;donnell &apos;s career
before her buzz cut .
之后事业开始向上发展
truth .
that &apos;s the big secret to business .
if people buy what you &apos;re saying ,
they will buy what you &apos;re selling .
max , stay alert . this could go to cult like that .
i like to think of those things you &apos;re holding
as my truth balls .
screw this . let &apos;s get to the meatballs .
anytime in the next two days ,
one of you is up here selling you something
that you feel is just bull ,
then toss it--
max !
i mean , ellen !
yeah , baby .
that is what i &apos;m talking about .
whoever threw that is not afraid to really go for it ,
and that will go a long way toward success in business .
all right , cool , but it is a long way to the buffet ?
&apos;cause i am starving .
okay , everyone .
consider these small groups you &apos;ve broken into
as little think tanks .
i need you to work together and bring out your very best .
max !
don &apos;t blame me .
blame the heavy cream at the fettuccini bar .
alfredo must be italian for &quot; roofie . &quot;
so , ellen , tell us what you have ,
and i &apos;ll tell you what we think .
oh , ellen . that &apos;s you .
oh , oh , yes , yes , that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m ellen . definitely an ellen .
see , i dance .
女主持艾伦与节目dj每集开场时 都是这舞步跟观众跳舞
okay .
okay . okay , now it &apos;s weird .
so , ellen ...
let &apos;s hear your b.b.b.--
your brilliant business brand .
i @-@ i don &apos;t do the talking . pamela does the talking .
pam ?
thanks , ellen .
hello , everyone , my name is pam ...
... panning ,
and what my partner , ellen , was trying to say is ,
we making very beautiful artisan cupcakes .
yeah , but they &apos;re still cool .
i never said they weren &apos;t cool .
yeah , mm , maybe they just didn &apos;t sound cool
coming out of your face .
i &apos;m sorry , but at least actual words
are better than , &quot; uh , uh @-@ uh , uh ... &quot;
ladies , hold .
sometimes in business
partner ships will sail in two different directions ,
这里分开为双关语 &quot; partner ship合伙船 &quot;
so you two need to find out if you &apos;re gonna continue
to sail apart or if you &apos;re gonna change course
and reconvene at the port of mutual understanding .
well , we can &apos;t sail too far apart
&apos;cause i &apos;m definitely gonna have to explain
what you just said to her .
i got it .
i &apos;m a boat , and i &apos;m trying to get away from you .
sounds right to me .
think it over .
talk it over with your first mate .
come back tomorrow
and tell me who your business is ,
and i &apos;ll help guide you toward that purpose .
and remember , you can &apos;t purpose without--
puss .
okay , wow .
gordon , her boat &apos;s kind of in shallow water right now ,
but we &apos;re gonna go away , get it together ,
and come back and blow you away .
and you can &apos;t spell &quot; blow you away &quot; without--
our ship &apos;s leaving .
oh , hello .
welcome to the williamsburg diner .
can i get you anything ,
like a work ethic ?
han , this is adorable , but we &apos;re busy .
we &apos;re pitching our business brand tomorrow ,
and max and i need to get on the same page .
yeah , we don &apos;t want to work here the rest of our lives .
well , now we &apos;re all on the same page .
han , just give us ten minutes .
then we &apos;ll get to work .
well , i &apos;ve waited four years .
what &apos;s another ten minutes ?
max , i have to say i was a little thrown
by that thing you said today .
what , that the best sex i &apos;ve ever had
was alone on the tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl ?
no , why would that throw me ? you say that every day .
no , that thing about me not sounding cool .
why would that throw you ? i say it every day .
yes , but not about the business .
so what was it ? the word &quot; artisan &quot; ?
okay , first of all , it sounds like &quot; fart @-@ isan , &quot;
as in , &quot; a fart is in this room right now . &quot;
somebody finally called you out on it , caroline .
so i was thinking our slogan could be ,
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes . sugar and spice . &quot;
i &apos;d rather go with fart @-@ isan .
really , beavis ?
what does your business partner butthead think ?
里面充满许多暴力与色情的话题 不宜儿童观赏
our business isn &apos;t working .
well , guess who is working .
me , the damn owner .
why are you surprised ?
you know how many cupcakes were not selling .
i mean , you &apos;re secretly eating at least six a night
to make me think we &apos;re selling more .
also &apos; cause i &apos;m sad .
look , i know you went to wharton and all , but--
wait ...
what &apos;s happening ?
is this a business intervention on me ?
from someone who pronounces the word business
&quot; bidness &quot; ?
why are you giving me the big eye @-@ painting face ?
you knew the business wasn &apos;t working .
well , i don &apos;t hear you coming up with any ideas .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you don &apos;t listen .
remember when i said we should stop making
all these flowery cupcakes
and just make ones that say mean things
like &quot; eat it &quot; and &quot; lick me &quot; ?
your big business plan is cupcakes
that say &quot; eat it &quot; and &quot; lick me &quot; ?
and other funny things like &quot; loser &quot;
or &quot; eat your feelings . &quot;
hmm , why not just shoot people in the face
when they come to the window ?
and i thought the back of our t @-@ shirt could just say ,
&quot; cream filled . &quot;
so funny if , like , a hot girl was wearing it .
and even funnier if it was a fat guy .
okay , maybe like gordon said ,
our partner ships are going in different directions .
my sugar and spice ship is going one way ,
and your mean and ugly booze cruise is going another .
so how about tomorrow , i &apos;ll sail my ship ,
and you can sail yours , ellen .
done .
and , pam , i know you think your ship don &apos;t sink ,
but it does .
so , hannah , todd , go .
tell us , who is your business ?
we make guitar case suitcases .
yeah , they &apos;re suitcases that look like guitar cases
so you can look cool at the airport .
so far , no truth balls .
that means we believe you &apos;re telling some truth
of who you are .
business is always--
okay then .
so what , their big idea
is just throwing your crap in a guitar case ?
well , it &apos;s no fart @-@ isan cupcake .
todd , hannah , did you get together with our graphic artist
to help create a logo ?
yes , we did .
we stayed up all night , and to be honest ,
it got kind of weird .
that &apos;s our logo ,
and our company &apos;s called
&quot; i &apos;m with the band . &quot;
back off !
she just got out of rehab .
business is not for the faint of heart
or coke addicts .
next up , we &apos;ve got ellen and pam .
let &apos;s give &apos; em some love .
max , you &apos;re really not gonna go up there
and sell your idea as a business plan .
yup , and i feel pretty good about it .
okay , well , then i hope you enjoy lots of balls in your face .
if i didn &apos;t at burning man ,
以集异想天开与荒诞之大成而著称
i doubt i will here .
gordon , hi .
as you predicted ,
today we &apos;ll be presenting our brands separately .
okay , looks like we have us a brand off , folks .
this is exciting .
i am feeling it !
ellen , i know you &apos;re not used to being alone .
neither was i , hence wife number three .
don &apos;t rush .
take some time to get yourself centered .
yo , yo , yo ! what &apos;s happening , sheridan !
ellen in the house .
let me hear some noise .
all right , all right .
we got some haters . that &apos;s cool .
ellen , did you design a logo ?
sure did . show it , player .
george , she &apos;s talking to you .
oh , good impact ..
boom , cupcake business .
but , um ...
where &apos;s the name of your business .
oh , i didn &apos;t want one .
i just wanted it to be cool .
so let me get this correct .
you want to make t @-@ shirts for your business
with no business connection .
okay .
this is your journey , but it might end here .
no , no , no , see , it &apos;s a cupcake ,
and we sell cupcakes , so that &apos;s the &quot; bidness . &quot;
okay , you know what ? screw this !
that t @-@ shirt is way cool , and if you can &apos;t see it ,
this seminar is so not worth the $ 1,000 i paid .
peace out .
in business , we call that a meltdown .
it happens .
so why don &apos;t we bring up ellen &apos;s former partner pam .
let &apos;s give pam a round of applause .
max , i don &apos;t have to go up there .
come on , we can just leave .
oh , look who wants to pack up their guitar suitcase and go .
you know what ? i was only leaving &apos; cause you failed .
i believe in my ideas .
good afternoon . hello , hi .
i represent max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
why max &apos;s cupcakes ?
why not ellen &apos;s or pam &apos;s ?
well , um ...
max was--max is this very special person
and the inspiration behind our whole business .
got it .
so max is an emotional touchstone
yes .
valid . go on .
great .
so the logo--
george .
this is our current company logo ,
and i feel it works just fine .
i mean , if it ain &apos;t broke , don &apos;t fix it , right ?
okay .
well , the cupcake shows a mix of sweet imagery
because we &apos;re two girls trying to retro @-@ repurpose the phrase
&quot; sugar and spice and everything nice . &quot;
hey , hey ! hey , hey , hey , hey , hey !
leave pam alone !
i &apos;m fine , ellen .
they can &apos;t shut me down , because i believe in us
and our special brand of artisan cupcakes .
why ?
give me !
eat it , you losers ! eat it , eat it !
i see the truth balls have stopped .
it looks like &quot; eat it , eat it , you losers , &quot;
might just be your brand .
you two are a combination of sugar and spice
and things not so nice .
speaking of truth , i need you to pay sandra for the seminar .
as much as i admire your pluck ,
12 trips to the pasta bar aren &apos;t free .
come on , pam .
yeah , let &apos;s go , ellen .
i &apos;m ellen .
guess what i have under my coat .
well , i know it &apos;s not a boob reduction .
what do you think ? cool , huh ?
aw , man , somebody already makes that ?
oh , bummer .
this is like when i thought i invented chip @-@ wiches .
should &apos;ve known . i was eating one at the time .
no , max , this is your shirt .
i got the rendering from the seminar
and had it made at
we can make anything in under an hour .
you know , that place under the bridge
near the underage bar where you got under arrest .
no way .
oh , no way . that &apos;s hot .
i know , and a girl at the place
asked me where she could get one .
really ?
kind of in love with myself right now .
hey , what made you change your mind about the t @-@ shirts ?
well , one of the things i learned at wharton
is that success depends on staying open to a better idea ,
even if it &apos;s not yours .
and here .
i thought you &apos;d rather a black one .
on tinder and in life .
