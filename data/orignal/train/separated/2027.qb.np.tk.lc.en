i want to go legit .
you can &apos;t .
then i get lola jensen to hack into the bar
and just put me in there , just like she did with harvard .
rule number one of not getting caught ,
you don &apos;t move the goddamn body .
harvey , i &apos;m stuck .
i can &apos;t live my whole life like this .
we &apos;re investment bankers .
our job blows yours out of the water .
just admit it . you want me to take the job ,
but you &apos;re too afraid to say it .
i want you to take the job .
you and your associate conspired with harold gunderson
to file a lawsuit against your own client .
that is a bribe .
quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit
with harold gunderson .
you need to call lola jensen .
you said it yourself . hacking into the bar
is twice the crime i &apos;ve been committing .
i am telling you quelling is on the trail .
and you quitting isn &apos;t gonna change that .
you &apos;re letting mike walk out the door
without trying to stop him .
any time i ask you about anything ,
all you say is , &quot; i can &apos;t talk about it . &quot;
look , mike is gone , harvey .
the jeopardy &apos;s gone too .
and now you want to turn around and tell someone
who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you ,
and it &apos;s not the third time , and it &apos;s not the fifth time ,
and it &apos;s not the last time .
you took money from our client &apos;s competitors
to trump up your bullshit suit .
the penalty is being disbarred .
being a lawyer is what i am .
if you take that away ...
it &apos;s up to you .
i &apos;ll drop the suit .
i &apos;m officially a member of the new york bar .
you went to lola ?
i want to stay .
i &apos;d bring in champagne ,
but after all we &apos;ve been through ,
i think scotch seems more appropriate .
does it ?
harvey , we &apos;ve had this conversation once .
if you want someone who doesn &apos;t speak their mind ,
i &apos;m not that person .
i know .
and mike staying doesn &apos;t change my opinion .
telling scottie about him is a mistake .
i know .
then why are you being so quiet ?
someone who keeps finding a way to be pissed at me ,
and it &apos;s not the third time or the fifth time
or the last time .
i wasn &apos;t gonna say that .
yeah , well , you did .
because you forced it out of me .
donna , do you want me and scottie to succeed or not ?
i want you to be happy .
that &apos;s an evasive answer .
no , it isn &apos;t .
just isn &apos;t up to me to decide what that means .
now are we gonna drink to mike staying or what ?
give me that .
not that one .
the bigger one .
seriously ?
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home .
i made dinner because i want to celebrate .
i &apos;m not taking the job .
what ?
i went to see harvey , and , um ...
i told him that i &apos;m staying .
what about the fact that it was eating you up ?
look , rachel , i know this isn &apos;t what you wanted .
what i wanted ?
i didn &apos;t wanna give you my opinion at all ,
but you forced it out of me ,
and then you told me that you were gonna take the job .
okay , rachel--
no , and now you come in here ,
and you tell me you &apos;re gonna stay a fraud .
a lawyer .
a fraud .
what happened to accepting me for who i am ?
what happened to you taking the job ?
it was a way out .
you said you were afraid if you told me your opinion ,
i &apos;d hold it against you ,
but now that i &apos;m not doing what you told me to ,
you &apos;re holding it against me .
i am .
yeah , that &apos;s not fair .
i wanna know what changed
from when you told me you were gonna take the job to now .
i went to see quelling .
he once had an offer on the table
that would change his life ,
and he turned it down
because he wanted to do what was right for his clients .
cost him everything .
the only thing it didn &apos;t cost him
was his ability to practice law .
and i didn &apos;t want to take it away from him
just like i don &apos;t wanna take it away from me .
mike
you said that staying is eating me up ,
but the thought of going is eating me up more .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m not ready to leave , rachel .
thanks .
michael ross .
yes ?
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
what can i help you with ?
we &apos;d prefer to have this conversation in private .
prefer ?
insist .
scottie .
i know we got in a fight ,
but drinking before 10 : 00 a.m. , is that really the answer ?
it is on mad men .
who &apos;s that guy think he is anyway ?
mike &apos;s staying .
you must be happy .
i am .
scottie , i &apos;m gonna do better about being open with you .
good .
are we good ?
we &apos;re good .
then let &apos;s go out tonight and have some fun .
i &apos;m in .
scottie .
yeah ?
let &apos;s go somewhere new .
donna , i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
i didn &apos;t tell her about mike .
harvey , stephanie liston just called me .
your friend from the u.s. attorney &apos;s office ?
she said they just brought mike in for questioning .
mr. ross , eric woodall .
i &apos;m the u.s. attorney--
for the southern district of new york .
yeah , i know who you are .
then you know you &apos;re in a shitload of trouble .
you wanna come clean , or should i lay it out for you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you conspired with harold gunderson
to defraud the united states government
by paying off witnesses against ava hessington .
what ?
you sound surprised .
i am because it &apos;s bullshit .
it &apos;s not bullshit .
you &apos;re facing some major prison time , my friend .
i &apos;m not your friend .
you can be .
pass .
i settled a lawsuit , okay ? i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
hey , i don &apos;t think you did .
well , not on your own anyway .
is there a question ?
come on , you &apos;re a bright young man .
you see where i &apos;m going .
i don &apos;t want the dealer .
i want the supplier .
harvey specter .
roll over on him , i &apos;ll cut a deal right now .
harvey specter . i represent mike ross .
sir , you can &apos;t go back there . sir !
well , hey there .
are you charging him ?
not at the moment .
then he &apos;s coming with me .
and you had no right to bring him in .
i had every right to bring him in ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter &apos; cause he came in voluntarily .
and he &apos;s leaving immediately .
we were just having a friendly conversation
about the witnesses who suddenly fell out
of the ava hessington case .
seems your associate was a little chummy
with the associate at bratton gould .
harvey gunderson , i think , is his name .
harold gunderson .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re harvey .
i gotta keep this all straight in my head before i make my case .
because once we bring harold in ,
he &apos;ll point the finger at mike ,
who will then have no choice
but to bring it right home to you , harvey .
i promise i won &apos;t forget your name again .
open that door .
good talking to you , mike .
hope it &apos;s the first of many .
jessica , i have some dire news .
i was just walking by the conference room ,
and i saw max pollard sitting there all by himself .
harvey was a no @-@ show ?
don &apos;t worry , i took care of everything ,
but it &apos;s not like harvey to miss a meeting .
thank you , louis . i &apos;ll look into it .
you see , that &apos;s just it .
i think something might be wrong with him .
you mean like he &apos;s a spy ?
no , jessica , listen .
ever since my heart attack ,
i &apos;ve been worrying about other people &apos;s health .
and i &apos;d ask donna , but i don &apos;t wanna burden her
with the knowledge of his mortality .
you don &apos;t think donna knows harvey can die ?
look , jessica , i know
harvey appears to be lean and relatively fit ,
but coronary disease can strike even the most handsome .
louis , listen to me .
harvey isn &apos;t sick . he didn &apos;t have a heart attack .
and if he missed that meeting ,
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a reasonable explanation .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m gonna go check my blood pressure .
oh , good idea .
where the hell is harvey ?
is he supposed to be somewhere he &apos;s not ?
donna , no games .
he missed a meeting with a longtime client ,
so either you screwed up , which you never do ,
or there &apos;s an emergency i &apos;m not being told about .
both .
meaning ?
i forgot to cancel that meeting
because there &apos;s an emergency .
what is it ?
mike ross got called in for questioning this morning .
sorry about this , harvey .
could have been worse .
you thought they had me for being a fraud ?
well , i didn &apos;t think they had you
for overdue library books .
why &apos;d you go with them in the first place ?
didn &apos;t your grandmother ever teach you
not to get into cars with strangers ?
i was being cooperative .
well , don &apos;t do that again .
goddamn quelling .
he didn &apos;t just hand us to the bar .
he went to the justice department .
i can &apos;t believe it .
i looked him in the eye . he gave me his word .
screw that guy . i &apos;m turning him into the bar .
right now he &apos;s not our problem .
harold is .
no , i &apos;m gonna talk to him .
not a chance .
harvey , they haven &apos;t brought him in yet .
all i need is five minutes to tell him--
- to stick to your story ?
that &apos;s exactly why they haven &apos;t brought him in yet .
you talk to harold ,
they &apos;ll be watching , we &apos;ll be done .
if we don &apos;t talk to him before this woodall guy
gets him in the room , we &apos;re in deep shit .
then we need to talk to him without talking to him .
allison holt .
harvey specter .
can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised to see you .
so i assume that means you &apos;ve spoken to the u.s. attorney .
i have .
then i suggest we make sure
we &apos;re on the same page .
unlike you , i don &apos;t automatically
protect someone who may have jeopardized my firm .
what exactly did you say when woodall came to you ?
he didn &apos;t come to me . i went to him .
what ?
a man named james quelling came at me ,
questioning the settlement between harold gunderson ,
mike ross , and your murder witnesses .
so you go straight to the u.s. attorney ?
my integrity was questioned .
first step isn &apos;t to go to the person
i &apos;m accused of colluding with to cover it up .
answer me one thing--
does harold gunderson know what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know what he knows ,
and , frankly , i don &apos;t care .
i fired harold gunderson an hour ago .
can i talk to you for a second ?
of course .
i just got taken downtown .
what ?
the u.s. attorney &apos;s office brought me in for questioning .
i thought it was about me , but it wasn &apos;t .
thank god .
no , rachel , it &apos;s still bad .
they &apos;re looking into the settlement
that i made with harold before ava &apos;s trial .
that deal wasn &apos;t exactly legitimate .
and they want me to turn on harvey .
i knew you should have taken that job .
this has nothing to do with that .
doesn &apos;t it ?
if you weren &apos;t working here ,
they wouldn &apos;t be able to use your relationship
with harvey as leverage .
you think i would turn my back on him
even if i wasn &apos;t working here ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;d ever turn your back on harvey .
that &apos;s the problem .
what does that mean ?
harvey wanted you to stay .
i wanted you to leave . you chose to stay .
so your priorities , they seem pretty clear to me .
rachel , come on .
hey , wait a minute .
if they charge you with something ,
they &apos;re gonna go through your records ,
and they are going to realize
that you &apos;re not a member of the bar .
no , they won &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
i had lola jensen hack into the bar
and put me in their records .
and when were you going to tell me ?
i was going to tell you everything last night ,
but you didn &apos;t exactly seem like you were in the mood .
oh , i &apos;m not in the mood right now either .
i am gonna go outside and get some air .
why don &apos;t you just stay here and figure out
if there &apos;s some other crime you can commit
to get out of this one ?
you should have called me the minute this went down .
there wasn &apos;t time .
you had time to see allison holt .
i was trying to get out in front of it .
allison holt isn &apos;t our problem .
mike ross is .
the u.s. attorney keeps poking around ,
he &apos;s gonna find out that his star witness
isn &apos;t even in the bar .
no , he won &apos;t .
if they look in the bar , they &apos;ll find mike ross
listed as a member .
you had him commit another felony ?
you want me to say that out loud ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;d rather get back to the matter at hand .
we need to make sure harold gunderson doesn &apos;t talk .
then you need to learn more
about the man who &apos;s trying to make him talk ,
because he &apos;s coming for you ,
and you don &apos;t know who he is ,
what he &apos;ll do , or what he &apos;s got .
i know one thing--
if he had any kind of proof ,
someone here would have already been arrested .
arrested ? for what ?
we &apos;re being investigated for the settlement
between us and bratton gould in the hessington case .
quelling didn &apos;t go away ?
quelling threatened to go to the bar .
this is the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
well , that only matters if the allegations have merit .
i never thought i would have to ask this ,
but do the allegations have merit ?
we &apos;re handling this , scottie .
i didn &apos;t ask who was handling it .
i asked if they have merit .
scottie . scottie .
what , are you gonna be charming ?
quote a tv show ?
what happened to &quot; i &apos;m going to do better &quot; ?
god damn it , i &apos;m trying .
harvey , i don &apos;t think you understand what trying means .
you know what , scottie ? you keep on thinking
that there are things being withheld from you , but--
but what ? it &apos;s just business ?
it is just business .
fine .
as a senior partner , i want to know
if this firm outright broke any laws .
harvey , i need to talk to you .
not now , donna .
if you want me to talk to stephanie ,
you have to tell me what you want me to ask her right now .
i guess it &apos;s &quot; not now , scottie . &quot;
mike ? mike . i need to talk to you .
no , no , i can &apos;t even be seen with you .
go , now .
but you have to talk to me .
allison holt just fired me out of the blue .
i &apos;m freaking out , man .
harold , listen to me .
you have to calm down , all right ?
harold gunderson , you &apos;re not welcome here .
you know what , louis ?
we &apos;re kind of in the middle of something right now , so--
well , i don &apos;t give a shit . mike , do me a favor .
do not let this unappreciative ex @-@ employee into our offices .
harold , you have to go , right now .
no , wait , mike . please .
i got a call from the u.s. attorney &apos;s office
asking for me to come in .
somehow , they &apos;re onto what we did ,
and i think we need to--
harold , harold , harold . harold .
all i know about that settlement is that you stuck it to us
because you saw the chance to get back at us for firing you .
mike , that &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t want to hear it , harold .
what you did was harsh and vindictive ,
but it was completely legal because you initiated it .
and nobody can prove anything other than that
as long as we both remember it .
i lost my job , mike .
i &apos;m sorry about that , harold .
i wish there was something i could do .
now i have to go back inside .
michael ross , harold gunderson ,
you &apos;re under arrest
for conspiracy to defraud the united states government .
thanks for meeting with me .
donna , you can thank me all you want .
i don &apos;t know anything about eric woodall .
stephanie , come on .
you know everything that goes on in that office .
you just don &apos;t want to tell me .
what do you want to know ?
well , how about we start with why he &apos;s coming after harvey ?
because he hates dirty lawyers .
he thinks they &apos;re the scum of the earth .
and harvey got on his radar ?
and the reason woodall &apos;s not on your radar
is because the last case he won took him four years .
so you &apos;re saying he &apos;ll stop at nothing ?
not that i &apos;ve ever seen .
then we need to know what he &apos;s got .
no way .
i called you when they brought your guy in .
i could lose my job for that as it is .
you have something else a lot more important than your job ,
thanks to me .
when are you gonna stop holding that over my head ?
in another 30 seconds if you tell me what i need to know .
okay .
he &apos;s got nothing .
but the thing is , he wins with nothing .
you just said he hates dirty lawyers ,
and now you &apos;re saying he &apos;ll break the law ?
he may , he may not .
but he &apos;ll definitely bend the shit out of it .
i want to know what &apos;s going on .
i told you what &apos;s going on .
harvey and i are taking care of a situation .
that &apos;s a bullshit answer , and you know it .
i don &apos;t know how it went with you and edward darby ,
but you come into my office with that attitude ,
and it won &apos;t go well for you with me .
my attitude comes from the fact that i worked for edward darby .
i don &apos;t want to work for another one .
you &apos;re way out of line .
your name is not on the door here .
no , but if this all comes down because of something
you and harvey did , i &apos;m tainted by it .
then walk away , scottie . i &apos;m not stopping you .
no , the noncompete you had me sign is stopping me .
is that what &apos;s stopping you ?
jessica , i moved my life back to new york .
i don &apos;t want to move again .
so i &apos;m asking you one more time--
what is going on ?
what &apos;s going on ...
is you and harvey made an impulsive deal for you to come here ,
and clearly , it &apos;s not working out ,
or you &apos;d be having this conversation with him
and not me .
well , look what the cat dragged in .
i &apos;ve been in here for two hours .
you said i was under arrest ,
but i still haven &apos;t been processed .
i demand to call harvey .
sorry , we can &apos;t have that .
then i guess you can &apos;t have a guilty verdict against me or anybody else ,
because i know my rights .
well , i &apos;m afraid your rights have run smack into
a little something called the patriot act .
whatever bullshit you &apos;re trying to pull only applies to terrorists .
then it &apos;s a good thing
there are allegations of terrorism against those hessington witnesses .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
i &apos;m not getting away with anything .
i &apos;m just being thorough by looking into these allegations .
try to be patient .
maybe , uh , think about the fact
that harold gunderson is trying to be patient right next door .
pacing . right on schedule .
first sign that a man is losing it .
it &apos;s called walking .
you can call it what you want .
i know what i &apos;m looking at .
yeah . so do i.
a guy who looked into those terrorist allegations
and came up with nothing .
i &apos;ll admit the rumors about those witnesses were unsubstantiated .
but i &apos;d be negligent if i didn &apos;t look into an american
with ties to such questionable characters .
and you never know what a thorough background check
is gonna turn up .
then go ahead .
do your background check , so i can get out of here ,
because all this is doing is making me bored .
well , i can take care of that for you .
why don &apos;t i let you watch a little tv ?
now , that &apos;s pacing .
did you find out anything useful on eric woodall ?
i found out we need to start going on offense .
how ?
donna &apos;s having mike compile every piece of communication
during that settlement to prove
harold contacted us first , not the other way around .
is that true ?
you really want to know ?
after that , we &apos;re gonna read up on
every tactic woodall used in his last case .
case ?
took him four years .
dog with a bone .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re going on offense .
well , i found out something too .
scottie wants to leave .
what ?
she asked out of her noncompete .
and what did you say ?
i said i had to discuss it with my partner .
it would have been nice if she discussed it with her partner .
she accused me of some pretty shady shit .
and she &apos;s right .
what are you talking about ?
i told you earlier ,
i didn &apos;t want to know about mike and the bar ,
and just now , you asked me if i wanted to know
about mike and harold , and again ,
i didn &apos;t want to know .
and &quot; i don &apos;t want to know &quot; is exactly what edward darby said .
we &apos;re not him .
edward darby didn &apos;t commit those murders .
he just covered them up .
and it seems to me we keep doing things ,
and then we have to keep covering them up .
we &apos;re not him .
harvey .
what do you want me to tell scottie ?
if she doesn &apos;t want to be here ,
let her go .
what the hell did you do ?
you know what i did .
i handed you in to the bar .
mike ross and i had a deal .
yeah , well , that deal went away when he got brought in
for questioning by the u.s. attorney .
what ? that wasn &apos;t me .
i didn &apos;t go to them .
i don &apos;t give a shit if you went to them or not .
this whole thing started when you walked into my office
with a lawsuit you were bribed to create .
and after that , i made a deal with mike .
and i held to my end of the bargain .
maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
that deal went away when they picked him up ,
hauled him in , and then tried to get him
to turn on me .
well , you can still stop this .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not going to .
well , then you better look over your shoulder every day
for the rest of your natural @-@ born life .
what did you say ?
you heard me .
listen to me , you son of a bitch .
you pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot my guy ,
and i don &apos;t give a shit if you didn &apos;t mean to shoot it ,
because it went off .
they &apos;re looking into me because of you .
and i ever so much as hear your name again ,
i will find you , and i will break every bone in your body .
you are nothing but a badass on his high horse .
well , mr. badass , i may have started them
looking into what you did ,
but you were the one who did it .
quelling , be on your way .
rachel , have you seen mike ?
no , louis , i haven &apos;t .
okay . is something wrong ?
yeah , something &apos;s wrong . we got into a fight .
i haven &apos;t seen him since .
well , i haven &apos;t seen him since he was talking to harold ,
but i need him to give me--
he was talking to harold ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know , they were having
some idiotic fight outside . why ?
no , it &apos;s nothing . i have to go talk to harvey .
whoa , wait a second . harvey ?
does this have something to do
with why he missed his meeting this morning ?
i can &apos;t .
rachel .
you need to tell me what the hell &apos;s going on right now .
donna , i know you saw what happened in the lobby .
i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
harvey , i can &apos;t find mike .
what ?
i &apos;ve tried his email , i &apos;ve tried texting ,
i &apos;ve looked everywhere .
i &apos;m telling you , mike is nowhere to be found .
louis , not now .
yes , now , harvey .
i know where he is .
he &apos;s under arrest , along with harold gunderson .
we need to get down there right now .
let me get this straight .
you two were in a heated conversation
when we picked you up ,
and that had nothing to do with this .
it had everything to do with it .
you mean you were trying to cover your tracks .
no , we were having a heated conversation
about what bullshit charges these are .
okay , i &apos;m done playing your games .
he was your only friend at that firm , you got fired .
you got him another job ,
and that &apos;s why you went to him to set this whole thing up .
you &apos;ve got your information wrong .
he wasn &apos;t my friend .
i had the chance to save his job ...
but instead , he threw me under the bus .
that is why i instituted this lawsuit .
so you can take your bullshit allegations somewhere else
because i am not gonna roll on harvey .
i &apos;m not rolling on mike .
and harold is not gonna roll on me .
you guys are well rehearsed .
so i &apos;ll ask you again ,
is that what you were doing on the street today ?
jesus christ , you know , you drive like my nana--
he drives like my nana , and she &apos;s 102 .
relax , louis . ray &apos;s on it .
nobody &apos;s getting us there faster .
i mean , i can &apos;t believe this whole thing &apos;s been going on
and i &apos;ve been completely out of the loop .
louis , i don &apos;t want to rehash it .
right now , mike &apos;s in custody .
we need to get him out .
yeah , and you need to tell me what the hell happened .
are you asking if we broke the law
when we made that settlement with harold ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m asking .
we have exposure .
well , then you better hope that ray drives
a little goddamn faster , because you and i both know
what &apos;s going on in there .
let me tell you what we are dealing with here .
conspiring to bribe witnesses-- seven years .
you filed a sworn declaration in support of your suit .
that &apos;s perjury-- another two years .
and to top it all off ,
the money was transferred overseas ,
which would be--
well , you &apos;re a lawyer . fill in the blank .
wire fraud .
bingo .
big winner . and your prize is 20 more years .
and here &apos;s the thing . i am gonna make sure
that it &apos;s not a cushy white @-@ collar prison .
this is just ridiculous .
if harold isn &apos;t broken by now , i &apos;ll shit my pants .
if harold &apos;s broken , then when we get there ,
mike &apos;s gonna be on his way to prison .
someone needs to get in there and hold his hand .
not someone ...
you .
are you serious ?
i &apos;m the last person in the world
that harold gunderson wants to see right now .
louis , when we were associates ,
who did you fear most ?
that &apos;s easy . my mother .
i meant in the firm .
daniel hardman .
so who would you most want to come in
and take on eric woodall ,
if you were in that room ?
daniel hardman .
exactly .
look , harold may not like you ,
but he respects you , and he &apos;s all alone .
now , when we get there ,
i need you to channel your inner hardman ,
get him to trust you ,
and then shut him the hell up .
can i talk to you for a second ?
you look concerned .
do you know why i never batted an eye when i found out
harvey had hired a kid who didn &apos;t go to law school ?
because you &apos;re loyal to him .
because i knew what was inside him .
and i thought if he had a protege--
he could have hired a protege from harvard .
but he wouldn &apos;t have been forced to protect him .
and he wouldn &apos;t have become the man he is today .
well , now that protege is in trouble .
they have mike and harold gunderson in custody .
then harvey &apos;s in trouble too .
no .
mike would never turn on harvey .
you never know what might happen to a person
once they get in that room .
not now , scottie .
donna , i &apos;m just writing him a note telling him i wanted to talk .
&quot; to talk . &quot;
i don &apos;t think you know how hard he &apos;s trying .
i know he &apos;s trying .
i &apos;m just not sure that it &apos;s good enough .
you knew who he was , scottie .
and i thought he would change .
i think he has changed , and if it &apos;s not enough for you , then--
that &apos;s not the problem .
i think that he &apos;s changed too much ,
and i think it happened before i got back .
he &apos;s a good man , scottie ,
but he &apos;s not perfect .
sometimes you just have to take what you get ,
or walk away .
you know , they did an experiment a few years back .
took five mice , put &apos; em in a cage ,
fed them just enough to survive , and you know what happened ?
one by one , they cornered the weakest mouse
and ate him alive .
you know what you &apos;re gonna be when you get to prison , mike ?
the weakest mouse .
bullshit .
they have done studies , and i &apos;ve read them ,
and that &apos;s not what happens .
the only way a mouse eats one of his own
is if he &apos;s been contaminated by another species .
yeah , you &apos;re right . it &apos;s bullshit .
but you know who believed it when i told it to him ,
five minutes ago ?
harold .
looks like you &apos;re out of time . harold &apos;s ready to talk .
you want to tell me something first ?
get to him before he changes his mind .
i demand to see my client .
you can see him ,
but i &apos;m not letting him go , &apos; cause in five minutes ,
i &apos;m gonna come back to him with a sledgehammer .
not so fast .
i demand to see my client ,
and my client isn &apos;t mike ross , it &apos;s harold gunderson .
and you are ?
louis litt , pearson specter .
you &apos;re telling me that a man who works at the law firm
he &apos;s accused of colluding with just happens to be his attorney ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
bullshit .
no .
what &apos;s bullshit is you thinking it &apos;s up to you
who gets to represent harold gunderson .
so if i walk in there right now
and ask him who his attorney is , he &apos;s gonna say it &apos;s you ?
doesn &apos;t matter what he says .
it &apos;s 407 , and if you don &apos;t let me see my client ,
anything he says after this second will be inadmissible .
and i will rain down fourth amendment claims on you
for the rest of your goddamn life .
if you wanted some me time , all you had to do was ask .
you &apos;d better have some good news for me ,
otherwise i &apos;m gonna be having plenty of me time .
harvey , this woodall guy is serious .
i &apos;m serious too .
then why am i still in here ?
because we &apos;re waiting for louis .
louis ? to do what ?
convince harold not to talk .
holy shit . louis is in with harold ?
harold hates louis !
it &apos;s our best shot .
so what do we do now ?
we wait .
louis , what are you doing here ?
first off , how you doing ?
how do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m in the seventh circle of hell .
well , the cavalry has arrived .
i don &apos;t need the cavalry . i &apos;ve decided to get out .
okay , harold , you cannot sign a deal .
you &apos;ll never work as a lawyer again .
what do you care ? you fired me as a lawyer .
now all of a sudden you &apos;re my best friend
when you need something from me ? go to hell , louis !
okay , you know what ?
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not your friend . never was .
but the one thing i &apos;ve never done is lie to you .
now , you have a chance to walk out of here today ,
as if none of this has ever happened ,
and all you have to do is trust me .
you have no idea who that man is .
no idea ?
how do you think i got in the room ?
okay , well , you know , louis ,
i am glad you got to take a good look at it ,
because if i don &apos;t give them mike ,
i could be in here for the rest of my life .
lawyers don &apos;t get paid to look out the window .
i can &apos;t concentrate either .
i just wish there was something we could do .
rachel , if this thing moves forward to trial ,
i will do everything in my power to win .
but there &apos;s two minutes left in the game ,
and our star players are on the field .
so right now , we just have to have faith .
w @-@ we ?
we .
you &apos;re going to work here .
we &apos;re going to be family .
and the way to get to know your family is by being with them
when their loved ones are in trouble .
how long do we wait ?
as long as it takes .
i want to talk to you about my defense strategy .
this is your defense strategy .
if this doesn &apos;t work ,
you &apos;re gonna want to talk to a different lawyer than me .
harvey , i don &apos;t care what harold gives them on me ,
i &apos;m not giving them you .
i want to tell you a story .
i don &apos;t want to hear a story .
it &apos;s about the time i decided to tell my dad about my mom .
you remember what i told you about her ?
harvey--
i was 20,
out of the house ,
and i told her i would never tell him
as long as she never brought anyone--
i came home to do laundry one day , and i heard--
i heard ,
and then i saw , and i told him that night .
because sometimes it &apos;s better to tell .
she deserved that .
so do i.
this whole thing was my idea .
i gave the go @-@ ahead . it &apos;s me woodall wants .
well , he &apos;s not getting you !
yes , he is .
no , i don &apos;t care what happens in that room ,
i &apos;m not giving you up !
don &apos;t be a fool .
don &apos;t be an asshole !
listen to me , god damn it , i &apos;m giving you permission--
i don &apos;t give a shit what you &apos;re giving me !
i hired a fraud .
and then we crossed the line with clifford danner ,
then with lola jensen , and then with these witnesses ,
and to top it all off ,
we suborned perjury with edward darby .
if it comes to it , you point the finger at me , you got that ?
let &apos;s just hope it doesn &apos;t come to it .
it &apos;s over . let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
hey , mike . how &apos;s it going ?
mr. specter !
eric .
just because you stopped gunderson from testifying
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m dropping this case .
then don &apos;t .
and i &apos;ll come after you for malicious prosecution .
you have no basis for that .
you arrested my client , he was here four hours ,
and you have no log with an outgoing call to me ,
all on the basis of a fabricated terrorism claim .
now , if that &apos;s not malicious , i don &apos;t know what is .
you say what you want .
you &apos;re a dirty lawyer , and now you &apos;re on my radar .
if i &apos;m a dirty lawyer ,
then you &apos;re looking in the mirror .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i just thought that i would never--
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
hey , honey , i &apos;m home .
did you remember to pick up the kids like i asked ?
yep .
the youngest one &apos;s turning into a real pain in the ass .
it &apos;s good to have you back .
good to be back .
what &apos;s on your mind , harvey ?
you were right . we are becoming edward .
i know .
and we need to get back to being us .
did you let her know about our decision yet ?
i assumed you &apos;d want to take care of that yourself .
you want a drink ?
they do it on mad men , right ?
jessica and i are gonna let you out of your noncompete .
what about the buy @-@ in ?
we &apos;ll take care of the buy @-@ in .
harvey , i , um--
mike ross never went to law school .
i knew it , and i hired him anyway .
why are you telling me now ?
because you accused jessica of being edward darby .
it wasn &apos;t her . it was me .
i still can &apos;t stay , harvey .
i know .
i just want to stop lying to the people i love .
i &apos;m sorry .
i told her .
i know .
she won &apos;t tell anyone .
i know .
she &apos;s leaving .
i know .
harvey , you &apos;re a good man .
am i ?
i turned quelling into the bar .
i took my rage out on him .
he didn &apos;t deserve it .
which is why i stopped it .
what are you talking about ?
do you seriously think that stephanie liston
is the only person who owes me a favor ?
well , that doesn &apos;t make me a good man .
that makes you a good man for me .
harvey , sometimes we need a little help .
big day .
horrible day .
it ended well .
thank you .
you and louis really came through .
so did you .
look , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t want to go to jail .
harvey ...
i sat in that room today and listened to you tell me
that ever since the day we met ,
you &apos;ve had to cross one line
after another , and--
mike--
no , just ... let me finish .
first there was clifford danner ,
then the witnesses ,
then suborning perjury , not to mention the 17 things
we did to stop the merger in the first place .
all of it , since you hired me .
look , that &apos;s not what i said .
yes , it is .
i wasn &apos;t blaming you for those things .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m tired of putting the people i care about in jeopardy .
i called jonathan sidwell this afternoon .
i took the job .
we just got out .
harvey ...
you gave me permission to point the finger at you .
give me permission to go .
you &apos;re a good man , harvey .
thanks .
hey , when &apos;s your last day ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
well , i want to take you out to dinner , you know ?
i &apos;m not gonna see you anymore .
i don &apos;t think you realize , but i &apos;m not exactly leaving .
sidwell . you &apos;re a client .
which means technically , you work for me now .
no , i don &apos;t .
&quot; no , i don &apos;t , boss . &quot;
don &apos;t even try it .
or &quot; sir . &quot;
whichever feels least comfortable .
you know , since i &apos;m working alone now ,
i guess that makes me superman .
or aquaman , seeing as you &apos;re in over your head .
