When the doctors told us
that neither of us was a match for our little boy,
that he would die without a bone-marrow transplant,
We were in despair.
But the best day of our lives was when an anonymous donor
stepped up and saved our son...
Don't tell me that was you.
Funny.
We knew we had to be the ones to start M.I.L.E.,
A bone-marrow database
that matches strangers through DNA.
But we could only do it with the help from all of you,
So thank you.
All right, let's go.
Excuse me, waiter.
Sorry. I don't work here.
I told you to wear a dress.
I only came because you said the food was gonna be good.
Care for some?
Oh, look. More peanuts.
No.
Why did you tell me that wolfgang puck was catering?
Well, he was supposed to.
It was a last-minute decision
to put the money into the charity.
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable.
I spent eight bucks on the beer. Does that count?
Can we please get something that isn't served in coach?
Okay, I'm on the board of directors.
I can't just leave.
Can I?
Yeah. Who's gonna know?
Live dangerously. Come on.
Dr. Isles.
Thank you for all you've done for M.I.L.E.
Of course. It's an important cause.
This is my colleague, detective Jane Rizzoli.
Thanks for attending our event.
Yeah, I should thank you
for sinking that putt on the 18th in the open.
I won the office pool.
Golf fan, huh? Do you play?
Well, that's not really a fair question
coming from a pro who regularly shoots a 61.
Oh, honey, I think it's time for you
to go work your magic with the platinum table.
Dr. Isles, could I snag you?
Those are all grumpy doctors.
I have a bad feeling they only came for the food.
Who would do that?
I bet they'd open their wallets
if I introduced them to the chief medical examiner.
I'd be happy to help.
Excuse me.
Dr. Isles made such a generous donation
to M.I.L.E. this year.
Yeah.
Well, that Maura...
She's a giver.
Mm. How about you, Jane?
Are you a giver?
What?
Would you excuse us?
Can I borrow you for a second, please?
Excuse me.
What is the matter?
What's the matter?
If we don't get out of here,
Taylor Franklin is gonna help herself
to what's left of my bank account.
Well, how much money did you give her?
A thousand bucks.
And she wants more.
Just say no.
I don't want to appear cheap.
Oh, no. Here she comes. Please, can we go?
Oh, no. Come on. I'm having such a nice time.
Can't you just, like, mingle?
When have you ever seen me mingle?
Can I get some more peanuts?
We ran out.
Well, let me at least introduce you.
Brad is a charming conversationalist,
a post-modern art aficionado,
And a prominent colorectal surgeon.
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
the words "Charming" and "Rectal"
used in the same sentence.
Oh, stop. Come on. Just join us.
No, and listen to a butt doctor
talk about art on an empty stomach?
No. It's okay. I'm leaving.
Okay. Here. Just take my car.
You sure?
Yes. I'll catch a cab.
No, I think you'll get a ride home.
I can't believe you've seen hung liu's work.
Of course.
The -- the way she addresses
issues of identity, marginality, sexism, and racism
is -- is awe-inspiring.
It is so refreshing to hear a man talk like this.
You know, female artists are so marginalized.
God, I-I could talk to you all night.
I could talk to you, too.
Oh, it's late.
Uh, I should go. I-it's a school night.
uh, you sure?
A chateau de la valence.
That's -- that's one of my favorites.
I'm gonna regret this tomorrow.
What's tomorrow?
Whatever the coroner's van drags in,
blood work to be reviewed,
Two trials to prep for.
Thank you.
I'm also hoping to start the identification process
on some human remains we discovered
at a construction site.
Oh, I did a rotation in forensic anthropology.
I found it fascinating.
Yeah, we've been waiting for all the bones to come in
to make sure we're only dealing with one victim.
So, it's a homicide?
Open case.
I really can't talk about it.
I'm sorry.
Tell me about your work.
No, e-even I don't want to talk about my work.
Yours is a lot more interesting.
Well, cheers to that.
Cheers.
Salud.
I still think you're wrong about Cindy Sherman.
Okay, okay, I'll give you Cindy
If you give me Sandy Skoglund.
deal.
I find it so hard to believe
that you know so much about female artists.
The female that I'd --
I'd really like to know more about is you.
Taxi.
Oh, no, no. There's no way I'm letting you take a cab.
Come on. I'm just parked around the corner.
Come on.
I don't trust valets.
I don't.
Come on.
Thank you.
Maura!
Hey, Maura!
Where's maura? We've got a homicide.
She's not answering her phone. I have her car.
What's happening? - Oh, she got home late --
Aound 5 a.m.
Are you working on this case?
So grisly.
They found bones at the new mall site.
Too bad. I wanted to shop there.
Check this out.
What are you doing?
Maura and I have been watching self-defense videos.
Ooh, I feel so empowered!
I can see why.
You're so good at it.
Maybe she went to get some coffee.
Maura.
Hello?
Hey, Maura. Did I wake you?
Uh... Well, let me see.
I'm talking to you on the phone.
Yeah.
What happened last night?
I don't know.
I don't know, but my head is killing me.
That's it?
What -- there's no scientific explanation
for the common hangover?
No lobes? No craniums?
No dehydration? What, nothing?
Ma, can you get her a cup of coffee?
Are you okay?
That is ugly.
Oh, come on. He's not even bleeding.
I meant the car.
There are those that consider
the Chevrolet Citation a classic.
Yeah, a classic mistake.
It's one of the 50 worst cars ever made.
Which means you owned one.
Yeah. So?
That car required more maintenance
than any of my wives.
Dr. Isles is wearing what she had on
when she left last night.
You can wear the same thing
if it's to the walk of shame.
Hey, watch yourself.
All right, what have we got?
Adult male, mid to late 30s.
Meter maid found him around 7:00 A.M.
Keys are still in the ignition.
No drag marks outside the vehicle.
Oh, so, he was killed inside the car.
It looks like he was punched in the throat.
Maura, what do you think?
Uh, is it bright out here?
Uh, did you guys get an I.D.?
Not yet.
No.
I ran the plates.
Car's registered to a Dorothy Macallister, deceased.
Her son sold the car for cash last week
and didn't get a name.
Open bar at the charity event last night?
I have no idea.
Body's not in full rigor.
Time of death within the last eight hours.
Maura, what is it?
There's a lot of bruising right there.
Oh, is that the guy from last night?
Yeah.
When's the last time you saw him?
Jane...
Maura, what is your I.D. Badge doing in the victim's car?
I don't know.
How do we keep this from becoming
a media feeding frenzy?
Paddy Doyle's trial is next week.
If I didn't know Dr. Isles, I'd rush to judgment.
"Mob boss's daughter kills her date."
But we know Dr. Isles didn't do it,
so maybe someone set her up.
It wouldn't be that hard to steal her I.D. Card,
put it in his car.
Okay, here's what I need to know.
Does she have an alibi?
She can't account for her whereabouts
1:00 to 5:00 a.M.
But what about witnesses?
Did anyone see them together?
Yeah, I saw them together,
And so did everybody at that benefit.
We've held off talking to them.
Why's that?
Because it's Dr. Isles, Sean.
What's she say happened?
She can't remember anything.
Okay. This is as bad as it gets.
We've got to bring her in for questioning.
What?
How can we investigate her?
We work with her.
Every cop in Massachusetts
has worked with her at some point.
Right now, it's our investigation.
But what about the autopsy?
Well, the governor assigned that, uh...
Dr. Vladimir Popov to the case.
Popov can't find his own ass
unless you put his hand on it.
I know.
Well, get ready.
This is gonna be worse than you shooting Paddy Doyle.
Yeah, governor.
Yes, I can hear you, Sir.
I don't know what to do.
We've got to do our job, Jane.
Do we have to do this right now?
Look at her. Something's off.
No, she was out of it this morning,
like someone else was in her body.
Is she a drinker?
No.
I mean, wine.
Maybe somebody slipped a roofie.
Yeah.
Yeah. The victim was a doctor.
Take a tox screen after you interview her.
Why after? Why not do it now?
We have to treat her like anybody else.
I don't like this any better than you do.
We should probably should do a rape kit, too.
Oh, my god.
Jane, you want me to do the interview?
No. I'll do it.
Rizzoli, you can't go in there
unless you're gonna go at her like any other suspect.
I can do that.
Okay.
I just ran a background check on Brad Adams.
You got to see this.
Did Brad Adams tell you what he did for a living?
Yes, I told you, jane.
He was a colorectal surgeon.
What did you talk about?
Art.
My work. He...
He ordered one of my favorite wines.
Did you leave the M.I.L.E. Benefit with him?
Yes.
How did you get home?
I, uh...
I wanted to take a cab.
Check the taxi companies.
See if there's any record.
Okay.
How did your I.D. get in the victim's car?
I'm not sure.
I remember walking past the valet,
And then...
Did he kiss me? I --
I think he blew me a kiss.
He blew you a kiss?
Do you remember anything after that?
Oh, no.
I was in his car.
She just put herself at the murder scene.
Oh, no.
Brad Adams had a record of theft and drug possession.
He owed $39,000 in back child support,
And he wasn't a doctor.
He was a bouncer at a night club.
Oh, god.
He played her.
The question is why.
It's getting hot in here.
Oh, god.
Where did you get those bruises?
Multiple hematomas.
Likely offensive in nature
due to the location on the arm.
This type of bruising would occur if I --
I threw a punch and it was blocked by someone's arm.
Dr. Isles, are you saying
that you attacked brad adams?
I...
I don't know. Maybe.
Why would you do that?
I was provoked?
Research indicates that even the most docile human
is capable of murder in the right set of circumstances.
Now what the hell do we do?
We take pictures and process her clothes.
Do you think that's the right call?
We don't have a choice.
Better us than anybody else.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.
You're just doing your job, Susie.
We're gonna need your underwear, too.
You know, I have processed hundreds of suspects,
but I never truly understood
how humiliating this is.
I'm so sorry, Maura.
Don't be. You didn't do it.
You didn't, either.
Maybe I did.
I've got a-a void in my brain
where there should be a memory,
and I've certainly experienced
the kind of rage it would take
to inflict that kind of an injury.
Just don't say anything else, okay?
Dr. Maura Isles, of course,
首席法医艾尔斯医生被控谋杀
is the commonwealth's chief medical examiner,
and she's back in the news again.
Just weeks before her notorious father,
mobster Paddy Doyle, goes on trial
for 15 murders and countless R.I.C.O. charges,
Dr. Isles is herself now a murder suspect
in what some are calling a date gone wrong.
Turn it off.
This is a bizarre stor--
It's all over the internet, too.
What do we know about our victim,
the phony colorectal doctor?
Well...we know he was a real asshole.
And he was also a thief,
a drug dealer, and a predator.
So he had enemies.
Here's something.
He had a pretty pissed-off ex-wife.
She wasn't getting a penny of the $39,000
he owed her in child support.
She'd at least get social security if he was dead.
Let's bring her in for a chat.
How's Maura?
Terrible.
How are you?
Not as bad as Maura.
What can I do?
Just help her.
Talk to everybody that Brad Adams knew --
neighbors, the ex-wife,
everybody that he worked with at the club.
Okay, Martinez cleared it
because he's got a history of drug arrests.
You got it.
Hey, wait. Check on Ma first.
Make sure she's okay.
Can you guys give us a minute, please?
You want me to call your lawyer?
You want me to call your parents?
No.
You know they got to take you to the hospital for this.
Yeah, I know. For the rape kit.
I know the drill.
Look, just -- just do your job, Jane.
Whatever happens, happens.
There's no way Maura murdered someone.
Jane's got to do something.
She is, Ma. We all are.
Do you have scotch?
No.
I don't drink scotch.
A double espresso -- whole milk today.
And when do you start making fries?
I'll, uh, start now.
How 'bout you? How are you holding up?
I'm worried sick.
Susie, I know you're not supposed to say anything,
but could you tell me something about the dead man?
We have to wait until Dr. Popov does the autopsy.
Wait -- - and he's not here --
Dr. Popov?
The guy who carries a gallon of vodka
and calls me "girl"?
Oh, boy.
Maura's really in trouble now.
I looked...
and if I were a guesser, which I'm not,
I'd say that the cause of death was...
asphyxiation due to a crushed trachea.
If I'm right, it was caused by
a direct, powerful punch to the throat.
Whoever did this knew what they were doing.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh...
get that espresso started.
You're back.
What are you doing here?
Everything I can before Popov shows up pickled.
That's kind of funny, right? Pickled popov.
Maura, you can't be here. You can't be working this case.
Well, am I under arrest?
No.
Is my tox screen back?
Not yet. Why? Do you think you were drugged?
I had a lot of wine.
Who knows?
What did the hospital say?
There's no evidence of sexual assault.
Good.
At least I could've claimed self-defense.
Have you remembered something?
No. No.
It's just I have done too much reading
on the science of murder.
In the presence of a threat,
the brain activity shifts from the --
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
to the midbrain periaqueductal gray.
I have no idea what that means,
and for once, I don't want to know.
These bruises say rage --
My rage.
Dr. Isles, what the hell?
I need you to clear out of this office now.
Officer Kelly,
I want you to remove her.
Lieutenant, this was my fault.
No, Jane, it's okay. Lieutenant.
What the hell were you thinking, Rizzoli?
I'm -- I'm so sorry.
We found your ex-husband like that.
You don't look too sad.
Me?
I'm trying not to smile.
Where were you last night?
Trying to make enough money to feed his kid.
Are you a working girl, Vivian?
I'm a massage therapist.
A therapist, huh?
"Vivian's hot hands.
Come in for your happy ending."
I'll give you the cop discount, huh?
And I'll give you 18 months in Framingham
unless you tell us exactly where you were last night.
I was with a client.
We'll need to talk to him.
His name's John.
If you find him, tell him he's a lousy tipper, huh?
Happy hands Vivian has been picked up a couple of times.
Maybe she got one of her clients to do her a favor --
take her husband out.
She's got a lot of clients who are cops.
A cop could've set Maura up.
That's a lot of free happy endings.
She's not cooperating.
We'll have to do a lot of digging
to come up with a client list.
In the mean time, what do we do with 50 people
who saw Maura leave with the victim?
Anybody see them get into his car?
No.
Okay, that's good.
Is CSRU finished with the car?
Not yet.
All right, what about Tucker and Taylor Franklin?
Was Brad Adams on their guest list?
Publicist and the Executive Director said he wasn't.
They never heard of the guy.
God, we need a break.
Come in.
Angela.
What's up?
Sean, I have something I have to show you.
Okay.
Okay, but before I do...
You don't think Maura did this, do you?
Angela, I-I can't talk about that.
Okay, well, this is really hard,
and I don't know what else to do.
What is it?
Here, can you look at this?
Okay, I just learned this one.
It's called the horizontal elbow strike,
and it's the most effective tool
for close-quarter combat.
When am I gonna be in close-quarter combat?
Well, you could literally kill a man with this move.
Come hold the board.
Hold it this way.
You're lucky I trust you. Ready!
So what? She can break a board.
Put yourself in a courtroom
and act like a cop, Rizzoli.
It demonstrates that the suspect
had the knowledge and the skill
to perform the underlying act that caused the murder.
Dr. Isles' tox screen is back.
No rohypnol in her system,
and, um, we matched the skin
found under Dr. Isles' nails,
and it matches the victim.
CSRU report is in.
They found Dr. Isles' fingerprints
and her hair
in the back seat of his car.
Come on, Bass.
I've got dandelion greens
and endive with parsley.
Come on.
I can't get bass to eat.
He is definitely responding
to the stress in his environment.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
Maura Isles, you're under arrest for the murder of Brad Adams.
I know you.
You're the bitch that put my old man away.
No, that wasn't me.
Yeah, it was.
I've seen you before.
Many studies have indicated that eyewitness identifications
can be wrong in up to 35% of cases
when you account for lighting, distance, and visual acuity.
You even sound like a cop.
Actually, I am the chief medical examiner
for the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
She's a cop.
I'm not a cop. Looks like this little bird
picked the wrong place to land.
Get off her, Gomez!
Get off me! Get off me!
Get off!
You're getting two chits for that.
You okay?
Thanks.
You need medical attention?
Could I get some ice?
You got it.
Paddy Doyle sends his regards.
What?
I'll get 'em to bring that ice.
You need anything else, you ask for Mary Pat, you hear?
Olives and ketchup?
You're not really gonna eat that, are you?
It's moldy cheese or this.
What do you got on Brad Adams?
Local boy.
He's been working as a bouncer for the last few years
all over town.
He was employed at a high-end club,
Hollow Venom, for about a year.
A lot of celebrities go there.
Well, word is he was the hook-up for drugs and women.
Ivy-league dropout.
Life fell apart when he developed a drug habit.
Smart con man.
That explains how he managed
to convince maura he was a doctor.
I can go if you're expecting someone.
Oh, yeah, I've got a real romantic evening planned
while my best friend spends the night
avoiding the showers in a women's prison.
May I come in?
Come on, Jane.
What? I'm not stopping her.
All right, I'm sick about what happened today.
Yeah, me, too.
W-why would you give that to Cavanaugh?
Because I couldn't give it to you.
Why not, ma?
Jane.
Be real.
You've got her hair and fingerprints in his car,
his skin under her nails.
It...
It's not ma's fault she's in jail.
Why would you go to your boyfriend instead of me?
I was protecting you.
I didn't want to put you in a position
where you had to decide what to do with that video.
I know what I would've done with that video.
I would've deleted it.
Oh, Jane, the cop in you
would hate yourself if you did that.
And you'd be charged with obstruction of justice.
Most I'd get is a year in jail.
Maura's looking at life.
Gomez, let's go.
You letting me out?
I'm escorting you to isolation.
I'll be back.
No way I'm letting you take a cab.
I'm just parked right around the corner.
What -- what happened to your face?
I need you to get Susie to do another tox screen.
Excuse me.
Attention, all inmates.
Whoever did this to my friend's face
will have to look over her shoulder for the rest of her life,
and if it happens again,
It will be a very, very short life.
Okay, Jane, please.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you
in front of all your new friends.
Okay, the tox screen.
Yes.
We did it. You were clean.
No, no, no.
She has to do a specific screen
for scopolamine.
Scopolamine?
Remember how I said I thought he blew me a kiss?
Yeah.
Scopolamine is also called
"The devil's breath" -- it can be administered
by blowing it in someone's face.
Well, that could explain a lot of this.
Yeah, what explains this?
You probably tried to get away.
Which one hit you?
It's not gonna happen again.
Oh, yes, I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.
Did you borrow someone's shank?
It's okay. Paddy put the word out.
That's not good, Maura.
Anyone that wants to hurt pPaddy will go after you.
Just get me out of here, Jane.
Look, anybody comes close to you, okay,
you just go with your elbow right to the throat,
All right?
Just stay alive.
Thank you. Did I get you out of bed?
No, I couldn't sleep,
But I think you pulled lover-boy from between the sheets.
Hot date?
Not anymore.
How soon before we find out if it was scopolamine?
Susie's on it, but she said it's gonna take a few hours.
It's a street drug from south America.
And it says here it turns you into a zombie.
Knew a guy who got dosed with it in Colombia.
Dumb place to vacation, if you ask me.
The second you're hit with it,
you do anything anyone tells you and not remember doing it.
He gave up his atm code.
Yeah, it's sometimes used as a date-rape drug,
but Maura wasn't raped.
Do you think Brad used it on her
to get into her bank accounts?
Even if he did, somebody still had to kill him.
You think he had an accomplice?
Maybe. Did you check Brad's financials?
His bank balance was pretty low.
What have we here?
A deposit for $9,500.
The week before the charity event?
He knew the kind of art she liked,
her favorite wine.
Maura doesn't even have a facebook page.
But she does have an interview
in la femme vivant monthly.
This is a big profile.
It's all there --
The wine, the art, details about her job.
He did play her.
He went to that benefit to find her.
And 9,500 bucks in cash tells me he was paid to do it.
And then he got killed for his trouble.
Korsak, you said this drug
will make you do anything you're told to do?
Frost, check her bank accounts,
and if he wasn't after her money,
what was he after?
We have a theory.
So, he gave her some zombie drug
so he could rob her,
then wiped out her bank account?
As far as we can tell, he didn't take anything.
So, if he didn't rob her or sexually assault her,
What did he do?
Well, we think he was after her I.D. Card.
Dr. Isles' card was swiped
to enter the M.E.'s office at 2:04 a.m.
Well, good. Let's get the video.
There isn't any.
There isn't any?
Dr. Isles was under the influence of the drug,
which means she might have told him how to avoid the cameras.
You can take the funeral-parlor ramp. No cameras there.
Yeah, but you don't break into a place unless you want something,
so what did he take?
We haven't found anything missing...yet.
But you have prints?
We think he was wearing gloves.
So, you don't have a theory.
You've got wishful thinking.
You're sure there's nothing gone?
We double-checked the inventory in here and in the autopsy room.
Nothing's missing.
Susie even checked the cold storage.
All the forensic specimens,
all the bodies are accounted for.
Well, he was looking for something. What was it?
What about the bone room? Did anybody check that?
We hardly ever go in there,
but Dr. Isles leaves the key right over here.
You ever been in here?
Once. Keypad's new.
Dr. Isles gave me the combination.
Wait a minute. Don't touch that.
That's a heat-activated touch screen.
If Brad wanted to get in,
He'd have to remove his gloves.
I might be able to lift a print.
405, skull and femur
of a teenage John Doe.
It's here.
I'll check the inventory.
Got it.
I got it, too.
Looks like a right index finger.
Oh, Korsak, that's great.
I'll get it to latent prints.
Okay.
Uh, 1204.
Partial adult female skull.
Okay.
1304...Is empty.
Is it supposed to be empty?
No.
What's supposed to be in it?
Bones that were discovered at the Stonehaven mall site.
They were in that drawer?
Well, I couldn't begin the forensic identification process
until all the recovery was complete,
but I had a near-complete skeleton.
So, what can you tell us about those bones?
I-I'd be guessing.
Oh, okay.
Never mind. Have fun in prison.
Tell Paddy I said "Hi."
Be happy to pass that along.
Oh, I hate doing this.
Uh...She was was a female in her 20s.
Okay, start checking the NCIC missing-persons database.
It's not much to go on.
Uh, Maura, what about height?
I didn't have enough of the femur or rib cage yet.
So, between 5 and 6 feet?
Yes, I think I could agree with that.
Oh, that's a big help.
You sure it wasn't between 4 and 7 feet?
7 feet?
Let's make her 5'6."
Okay, you know, I know what you're doing.
You're gonna say that she was just 300 pounds
so I could say, no, she was approximately 110 to 120.
You get that?
See? Was that so hard?
How long was her body in the ground?
You'd expect to see that level of decomposition
if a body had been buried for between 6 to 12 months,
depending on inclement weather...
She'll be up for parole by the time we're done with this.
I can only let you do this for about five more minutes.
Your lips are blue.
Thanks.
What does Paddy do for you to take this risk?
It's what he doesn't do.
I got a brother on the inside.
I got six hits.
Maura, can you see these photos?
Uh, yes. Sorry.
Is it one of these women?
I don't know. I...
Susie, there are crime-scene photos of the bones.
Yeah, I have them right here.
The distance between the conical orbits,
the size and symmetry of the nasal opening,
The pronounced zygomatic bones...
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Well, I really need more comparable data, Jane.
No, you really need to sleep in your own bed.
Judging by the broad, round facial-projection features,
she's likely of African or South American descent.
I'll have to go with number five.
Susie, what do you think?
Definitely number five.
Sofia Alvares, 23.
Brazilian swimsuit model.
Missing 10 months.
Got it -- we matched the print on the keypad
to Brad Adams.
So we can prove he was here.
But why would he want those bones?
Susie, I want to see
all the photographs of the bones.
Csru didn't find all of her remains.
I know. It's a partial skeleton.
Just show me the next photo.
Stop right there.
Go closer on the hyoid.
We need a cause of death.
Well, it would be better if I could do an autopsy.
Maura, Popov will be here soon.
Crushed hyoid bone.
Could you show me Brad's neck?
It is so reckless to guess.
You're in jail. Ask the guards.
They're not gonna add more time for guessing.
Cause of death appears to be the same for both Brad and Sofia.
All right, well, that means we're looking for one killer.
So, he hired Brad to hit on Maura,
break in here, and steal Sofia's bones?
Yeah. No disrespect, Maura, but why did our killer think
that you could tie him to Sofia's murder?
I don't know.
Susie, were any more bones from the site delivered today?
Uh, yes, but they're just fragments.
I started laying them out.
Isolate that small bone on the left.
Describe it to me.
A fragment approximately 8 millimeters long...
With an epiphyseal end.
It's not a bone fragment. It's a fetal clavicle.
She was pregnant?
Somewhere between eight and nine weeks.
That's what he was afraid of.
Fetal DNA would tie him to Sofia.
Because our killer is the father of her baby.
Ok. Thanks, Susie.
Susie was able to extract fetal DNA from that fetal clavicle.
Did she compare it to Brad's DNA?
Yeah. It's just like we thought.
We can rule Brad out as the father.
We should run that DNA through CODIS.
Hey, Korsak, you're gonna be glad
you didn't fall asleep in the break room.
Look at this.
Is that Sofia?
Uh-huh, and her supermodel pals.
Wait. What club is that?
Hollow Venom.
Frankie said that Brad worked there.
And there he is.
Just established a connection between Brad and Sofia.
Yeah, but we also confirmed cause of death for the both of them
wth the help of Maura, who is also our suspect.
Any chance dr. Popov could come up with the same findings?
Please, the only thing I'm certain Popov will find
is some chilled vodka.
There's got to be something we can do
with all that equipment down there.
I can't.
It's a criminal violation,
And it could ruin the evidence for court.
I'm not asking you to cut him open.
I just want to get a look at his hyoid bone
to see if it was crushed like Sofia's.
I mean, what about an X-ray or an MRI?
That won't show you enough.
Fine.
What about that fluoroscope thing?
Might work.
We can at least see
the tissue below the surface.
Okay, that. That --
That's bruising, right?
There's a distinctive subdural hematoma, yes.
The shape of that bruise doesn't look like
it would be caused by an elbow strike.
It's more consistent with the shape of a --
A closed fist.
That's weird. Why are those bruises there?
Those three distinctive oval marks?
I don't know what could leave marks like that.
All right, well, it's -- it's more than we had before.
Maura would be very proud of you.
She's my hero.
So are you!
But she's an M.D.
We got a hit.
I think we just I.D.'d Sofia's baby daddy.
Tucker Franklin was the father of Sofia's baby?
Yep, Tucker Franklin,
famous golf pro and philanthropist.
Crazy, right?
Nothing came up on CODIS,
so we ran it through other DNA databases.
Tucker's DNA was on file
with his bone-marrow charity.
Tucker introduced Maura to Brad.
Because they knew each other.
Look at this.
Tucker going into a fancy club.
Hollow Venom again.
That's the same club Sofia frequented.
And there's Tucker with his bouncer friend, Brad.
You know, Frankie said Brad was the guy
who hooked up celebrities with women and drugs.
Looks like Brad hooked Tucker up with Sofia,
but Sofia got in the family way.
The only way Tucker holds on to his fat endorsement deals
and his marriage was to eliminate her.
Once those bones surfaced,
he knew it was just a matter of time
before Maura identified Sofia
and tied Tucker's DNA to their unborn baby.
But why did Tucker kill Brad?
Tucker didn't want to leave any witness.
You know, one good punch to the throat
with something to protect those soft hands.
We still don't have enough probable cause to arrest him.
We do have enough to question him, though.
Look, it's Tucker Franklin!
Park it up front, pal.
Yo, Tucker Franklin, man!
Tucker Franklin!
Would you look at that?
I bet that would leave three distinct oval bruises.
Hey, Tucker.
Do I know you?
You know me well enough to take my $1,000 check
for your charity.
Oh. Well, thanks.
This is a nice keychain.
What are you doing with my keys?
Oh, I'm not the valet.
You know, it makes sense
that you'd want to protect that million-dollar grip.
You can't use those soft hands to punch people.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hell of a swing, too.
And with these brass knuckles, it would just take
one good punch to the throat to kill Sofia...and Brad.
oh, my god.
Guess we're gonna have to park that Hummer in the impound lot.
Tucker Franklin, you're under arrest
for the murder of Sofia Alvares and Brad Adams.
Thank you. Thank you.
So many of you admire me,
Dr. Vladimir Popov, and my work.
Leave it to Popov.
Excuse me.
Girl.
I need this cold.
You sure know how to make an entrance.
I was thinking of wearing my neon orange jumpsuit,
but I thought it'd be too much.
Yeah, you can wear it tomorrow.
So, did you get any new prison tats?
None that I want to show you.
So, what do you want to do now?
Go to work.
Okay.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
