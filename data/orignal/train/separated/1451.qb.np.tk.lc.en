this week , the world lost a great man ,
and i lost a mentor .
for nearly 60 years , professor ringmaster al uzielli
helped young hopefuls like me find their clown persona .
&quot; professor ringmaster &quot; ?
it &apos;s a very prestigious title at clown college .
one step below piemaster general .
where &apos;s lewis ?
who knows ?
okay , guys , it &apos;s just us .
lift on three .
第三季 第十八集
hey , how come you guys haven &apos;t accepted my friend requests ?
i didn &apos;t know you were on facebook .
yeah . you said it was only for teenagers
and people looking to have affairs .
well , i figured if you can &apos;t fight it ...
not the having the affair . that &apos;s still bad .
no . not that , but there &apos;s nothing wrong with catching up
with a few old friends , right ?
or doing a little social networking with by b.f.f.s ?
social networking or social not @-@ working ?
oh ! you know what we gotta do ?
we gotta get a picture of us all together on a boat .
i think that &apos;s a thing now .
so what do you say ? accept my friend thingy .
sorry , mom , i @-@ i didn &apos;t get a friend thingy from you .
yeah , you know , they have a lot of blocks on there
to protect kids from weirdos .
mm . okay . good , good . i &apos;ll send it again .
great .
please do .
please don &apos;t .
we got her request the first time , but ignored it .
i can &apos;t have her on there snooping around
seeing what i &apos;m doing at parties .
or posting pictures of us on family vacations
wearing old , dorky clothes .
what ? what &apos;s wrong with this ?
dad , check it out . i made one giant oreo .
luke , what are you doing ?
you gotta eat it like it &apos;s an ear of corn .
genius .
wow . new suit ?
new everything .
kids , gather &apos; round . it &apos;s time for a life lesson .
aren &apos;t we already gathered ?
let me tell you something .
hard work , determination , and perseverance always win out .
i am living proof that nice guys can finish first .
today i have a chance to get the biggest listing of my career .
oh , i have never seen this man so focused .
i &apos;m like a boxer before the big fight .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t have sex with claire last night .
sorry , honey .
mm . it &apos;s--it &apos;s okay .
but as soon as i get this listing--ding !
let &apos;s just stop . stop .
i see you .
what ? i &apos;m scratching .
hey , mom ?
is it okay if i have a friend come over tomorrow ?
who ? reuben ? or the nervous one that gets the nosebleed ?
it &apos;s griffin cooper .
griffin cooper ?
griffin cooper is , by far ,
the coolest kid in manny &apos;s grade .
he &apos;s a terrific athlete , he &apos;s confident .
manny &apos;s a great kid , sure , but he &apos;s not exactly cool .
he can &apos;t even open a door cool .
salutations , wyatt . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re joining me
for an afternoon of mirth .
ah , good evening , reuben @-@ san .
may i ask you to remove your shoes ?
tonight , we are going japanese .
ah ! hebalaboo ridabeley lai mubay rumboo .
i invented a new language this morning .
when did you guys become buddies ?
was it a football game in the yard ?
you made a great catch ?
no , that didn &apos;t happen .
but the librarian told me one day i &apos;ll be a great catch .
i &apos;m really not getting that relationship .
why can &apos;t you just be happy that manny &apos;s making new friends ?
no . &apos; cause it doesn &apos;t add up .
cool kids like griffin cooper--
they don &apos;t hang out with kids like manny .
manny &apos;s very cool .
maybe those kids are finally catching up to him .
wait a minute . i get it .
couple of days last week ,
i took manny to school on my motorcycle .
griffin must think i &apos;m pretty boss .
yes , jay . it &apos;s all because of you .
kids are looking for role models .
why do you think fonzie was so popular ?
he told people that they were rich ,
but really took their money with his scheme ?
no , that &apos;s a ...
yes .
those people were victims of a fonzie scheme .
it &apos;s showtime .
hey , dunphy .
you gettin &apos; ready for your one @-@ woman show ?
mitzi .
mitzi roth-- a notorious poacher
in the world of high @-@ end residential real estate .
we call her the &quot; nightmare on elm street , &quot;
because she sold a lot of houses on elm street .
what are you doing here , mitzi ?
i have an appointment . this is my listing .
oh , i didn &apos;t think that was dotted line yet , jazz hands .
no worries . i may have an interested buyer .
i &apos;ll bring him to you .
really ?
okay , but could you come back later ?
i really need to have them to myself right now .
oh , yeah , okay . i completely understand .
okay , thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
wait . what ?
what are you doing ?
watch this .
hello ?
oh , it &apos;s mitzi roth .
and phil dunphy .
i may have a prospective buyer
for your beautiful house .
i was wondering if maybe i could come in ...
hey , stan ! hey , patti !
and just have a look for a little while .
we &apos;ve got a lot to talk about .
come on in .
hey , guys . yeah .
i &apos;m wondering if maybe we shouldn &apos;t be alone for this .
i &apos;m in .
go back to condos , dunphy .
oh , my god ! this place is absolutely gorgeous .
stunning . stunning .
you are in such good hands with phil .
hey .
how are you guys ?
i mean , fingers crossed , though .
you know , so many new companies go belly @-@ up .
terrible .
well , good to-- good to see you , mitzi .
guys , how are you ?
oh , no . no , no , it &apos;s fine.it &apos;s fine .
come and take a look .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
mitzi , please !
mitzi , please ! please !
what are you doing ?
oh , my god ! he shoved me !
what ? !
he shoved me !
for god sakes ! phil !
oh , my god !
i thought you had your anger problem under control !
i don &apos;t have an anger ...
i don &apos;t--anger problem .
i don &apos;t have an anger problem .
whoa . hey . it &apos;s over ? what the hell ?
you &apos;re an hour late .
huh . good to see you , too , chuckleberry .
look at that . your oversized pants are starting to fit .
hello , lewis .
hello , fizbo .
for several years ,
i was one half of the renowned clown duo
fizbo &amp; lewis .
we were huge .
in children &apos;s parties .
anyway , i disbanded the group shortly after i met mitchell .
it &apos;s hard to have a relationship and a clown career .
that &apos;s the reason there are so many single clowns .
just one of the reasons .
anyway , um , lewis hasn &apos;t spoken to me since .
he &apos;s still bitter , and i don &apos;t blame him .
it &apos;s kind of like i broke up the beatles .
of children &apos;s parties .
what do you say we hit a bar ?
tip a few back to al , huh ?
i heard you were in jail .
yeah ? i heard you &apos;re still doing that lame giant scissors bit ,
you blue @-@ haired hack .
who &apos;s in ?
i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll go .
just give me a minute . i gotta redo my lips .
all right . cerveza .
what about you , fizzy ?
you gonna come or you gonna break up this party , too ?
hey , shotgun , bitches !
i should , you know , probably go .
you know , for--for al .
oh , yeah , no , of course .
but , hey , listen , don &apos;t let him get to you , all right ?
no . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s all seltzer under the bridge .
just one drink , and then i &apos;ll be home .
okay . just drive me home first ?
no , you , uh , you--you take the car .
i , uh , i &apos;ll go with the guys .
in that tiny car ? how are you all possibly gonna ...
forget i asked !
it &apos;s 5 : 00 in the morning .
daddy &apos;s juggling !
lily , honey , what are you doing up ?
are you just getting home ?
yeah , things got a little out of hand .
somebody had a flower that squirted tequila .
what do you mean &quot; somebody &quot; ? i want full credit .
what up , red ?
really ?
teach me to juggle !
it &apos;s very simple .
the key is to
be aware of where everything is at all times .
and don &apos;t forget the importance of balance ! oh !
okay . okay . come on .
i think i cracked my eggs .
we &apos;re out of eggs ?
are you yolking ?
and i haven &apos;t eaten in five days !
five days ! are you cereal ?
lily , don &apos;t ever do that .
okay . you two are deliberately not confirming me .
everybody else has accepted my facebook requests--
your father , uncle mitchell ...
adele .
that &apos;s right . adele has agreed to be my friend ,
and my own daughters haven &apos;t .
yeah , you may just be a fan of adele , and--
what is so private that i can &apos;t possibly see it ?
nothing .
nothing . you just don &apos;t want to be my friend .
great . i can see my next status update--
&quot; my daughters are monsters . &quot;
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
mitzi got the listing .
oh , no , honey . that &apos;s awful .
she cheated , she lied , and she won .
kids , gather &apos; round .
again , we are gathered .
you wanna get ahead ? don &apos;t play by the rules .
turns out nice guys finish last
in this cold , dog @-@ eat @-@ dog world .
it &apos;s not fair . why don &apos;t you play dirty , too ?
you could take her down .
honey , &apos; cause your dad is a better man than that .
he has values and morals and--
you . keep talking .
well , just off the top of my head ,
you could take my spy pen and record her admitting what she did .
and then you could play it for those people
so they realize what a jerk she is .
your dad is never gonna
do that--
you &apos;re a regular chatterbox today !
get me that pen !
i got it !
remember , pal , keep it simple .
hey , manny .
griffin--legendary creature of greek mythology
with the head of a lion and wings of an eagle .
what &apos;d you say , jay ?
never mind .
jay pritchett . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
you know , i , i saw a little of that basketball game of yours last week .
you were lightin &apos; it up .
thanks .
i was lighting it up , too , jay .
who &apos;s hot ? we &apos;re hot !
mustangs are hot !
hola , griffin . how are you ?
13 .
i &apos;m fine .
so what do you boys have planned for today ?
well , it &apos;s kind of a surprise for griffin ,
but let &apos;s just say it involves decoupage .
oh , jeez .
come on . let &apos;s go .
good @-@ bye .
oh , no .
what ?
you were right .
this boy is not here to see manny .
i told you . you see the way he looks at me ?
no , fonzie , the way he looks at me .
he couldn &apos;t talk . he kept staring .
he was just like my teachers back in school .
gloria , you &apos;re very pretty .
but the kid idolizes me .
really ?
griffin ! manny !
do you want to go with jay to ride his motorcycle ,
or you want to go with me to the supermarket
and buy a couple of onions ?
motorcycle rides !
onions sound good .
guess he has a thing for you , too .
hey ! we &apos;re back !
hey , i @-@ i just finished cleaning the kitchen ,
so if anyone has to do a spit take ,
please do it over the sink .
we felt really bad about that , so we got you a present .
what--what &apos;s the deal with this ?
i open it up and snakes fly out , or a fire ?
no , we just know that you like to read .
yeah . so open it .
aah ! got him !
no . no . that &apos;s exactly what i expected .
&apos;member , when i told you ?
okay . look , it &apos;s almost go time ,
so we should have a shot and go white up .
i &apos;m sor--excuse me . &quot; white up &quot; ?
oh , yeah . lewis got a call to do a birthday party this afternoon ,
so we &apos;re gonna put the old act back together .
yeah , fizbo &amp; lewis , together again .
and they said it would never happen .
said . hoped .
could i talk to you for a second ?
uh @-@ oh . trouble in queer @-@ a @-@ dise .
okay , look , gonna go out to the car for smokes .
please tell me &quot; smokes &quot; is not another clown ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think i could handle another one of him .
oh , lewis is not that bad .
well , what do you see in that guy , cam ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe the fact that
he doesn &apos;t roll his eyes every time i talk about the art of clowning ...
like that .
he may have had his faults
but we were great together .
we had an unspoken language .
we finished each other &apos;s balloon animals .
but you would never know ,
because you have never been to one of our performances .
birthday parties .
you hate my clown side .
no . no . no . i don &apos;t hate it .
just admit it . i basically already know you do .
okay . okay . cards on the table .
it &apos;s not my favorite thing that you--
oh , how dare you ?
i am a clown . it &apos;s who i am !
if you squeeze me , do i not honk ?
eye roll !
oh , like i had a choice !
knock , knock .
what are you doing here ?
hey , um , i @-@ i brought you some ... soup .
you know , i thought about it , and maybe i did push you .
so ... how &apos;s the ankle ?
oh , come on , dunphy . you know i flopped .
haven &apos;t you ever seen an nba game ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . in your case , wnba .
so that was all a ruse ?
the oldest trick in the book .
you need to step up your game , son .
you know what ? i almost feel sorry for you .
come here . give me a big hug .
oh , yeah . yeah .
no hard feelings , huh ?
none at all .
good .
because i just recorded your entire confession ...
right here on my ...
spy pen ?
second @-@ oldest trick in the book .
oh , god . a real man would have just poisoned the soup .
are we ... done here ?
ah . thank you .
hey , mom . guess what ?
griffin invited us all over to his house
for a pool party and barbecue tonight .
pool party , huh ?
yeah , and he said bring your swimsuits .
he was pretty adamant about it .
it &apos;s 50 degrees outside .
sounds fun .
great . i &apos;ll call him .
you know , you &apos;re basically agreeing to a date with a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
jay , we use this go get us tables at restaurants ,
why can &apos;t we use this to get manny a friend ?
because he &apos;s not really getting a friend .
oh , but when you thought that
he was trying to ride your motorcycle , it was okay .
maybe now i don &apos;t like what he &apos;s trying to ride .
manny likes griffin .
maybe someday , if they spend enough time together ,
griffin will like manny .
what ? griffin doesn &apos;t like me ?
no , no , no , papi . he loves you .
but you just said someday griffin will like me .
that means he doesn &apos;t like me now .
you know what , kid ?
we think that griffin might be hanging out with you
because he &apos;s got a little crush on your mother and me .
on you ?
wow . i can &apos;t believe it .
listen , it &apos;s fine . you &apos;re gonna be fine . okay ?
i &apos;m sorry .
are you kidding ? it &apos;s fantastic !
how is it fantastic ?
i &apos;m only hanging out with him
because i have the hots for his sister chloe .
you &apos;ve met griffin . the kid &apos;s a doorknob .
so you &apos;re just using him ?
yeah , and i felt really guilty about it until now .
now it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
not for me !
just suck it up , mom .
i &apos;ve done a lot for you over the years .
jay , you , too . this girl could be the one .
then i &apos;m out of your hair forever .
pool party , mom . dress accordingly .
can you help me reach that box of cereal ?
hey . you &apos;re mitzi roth .
i recognize you from your ads .
smokin &apos; , right ?
i &apos;m luke dunphy .
my dad &apos;s phil dunphy .
i &apos;m sorry .
why do you hate him so much ?
it &apos;s just business , kid . it &apos;s not personal .
well , it &apos;s personal to us .
i &apos;ve never seen my dad so worried before .
i have this spy pen ,
and i heard him talking to my mom ,
and he &apos;s scared about paying for my sister &apos;s college next year .
and i guess he &apos;s nervous about some kind of party ,
because he said there &apos;s a big balloon payment .
anyways , he &apos;s like the best dad ever ,
so maybe you could be a little nicer to him .
there you are , buddy .
check it out . they &apos;re giving away free jelly beans .
hey , mitzi .
dunphy .
you have a very nice kid there .
he &apos;s mine .
hey , so i was thinking after , uh , little fizbo ,
we could do the ladder bit .
ah , crap . i forgot the ladder .
you know , i &apos;ll remember it next weekend .

and a birthday party in pasadena .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . i @-@ i can &apos;t do that .

we &apos;re taking lily to the aquarium next weekend .

well , that was just for today .
oh . oh , sure .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry if you thought ...

when did we add a frying pan to the act ?
we don &apos;t need-- nope ! don &apos;t need the frying pan !
why are you doing that ? stop doing that .
screw you , you traitor .
ow ! that hurts !

okay , look , here &apos;s the deal .

oh . you did .
unbelievable .
i &apos;m so sorry . but thank you .
bye !
kids , gather &apos; round !
we are right here !
let me tell you something-- people are fundamentally good .
the key is , you find that goodness deep within &apos; em .
twist it ,
and turn it to your advantage .
hello .
and ... there she is .
what are you gonna hit ?
college , balloon payment , greatest dad ever .
nice . do you want me to squirt some tears in your eyes ?
