zach , you &apos;re 14 years old .
you are a freshman in high school .
you had a junior in your room yesterday with the door closed .
the computer stays here .
you know those envelopes on your doorstep--
they &apos;re just the beginning . i have a lot more .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
somebody &apos;s trying to set up dad .
zach , this is serious .
did anything come for me at the apartment that i didn &apos;t get ?
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . a package or something ?
is this fake , too ?
i don &apos;t know .
last year , glenn wiretapped your phones .
what ?
i saw the recordings on his computer .
i said i might come over .
i thought you said ...
well , laya wants to go to the riviera to see the prairie cartel .
is that a stuffed elephant behind you there , zachary ?
well , that is adorable .
i had no idea that you collected stuffed animals .
i &apos;m in my sister &apos;s room .
oh , bro @-@ sis bonding night .
that &apos;s very sweet .
my mom moved my computer into the living room .
it &apos;s been 20 minutes already .
just ... five more .
you &apos;re not even supposed to be on my computer .
so use mine .
mom &apos;s out there .
i have spent the last year nannying full time ,
but with grad school , i can really only do part time .
and you &apos;re at northwestern ?
yes .
a dual master &apos;s in business and educational psychology .
i &apos;m really interested in child development .
uh , have you heard of the emt ?
the educational measurement test .
my father created it .
you &apos;re not even supposed to be talking to anybody .
why do you care ?
because it &apos;s my computer .
if you &apos;re not gonna be using it ,
then really , who cares ?
it &apos;s mine !
i &apos;m from a big family .
six brothers and sisters .
anyway , um , part time is perfect for us .
i &apos;m just looking for someone who can cover the hours
that my mother @-@ in @-@ law can &apos;t be here .
so , this would be afternoons ?
evenings ?
yes .
uh , i was hoping that someone could start next week .
so , i will call your references ,
and we &apos;ll be in touch .
good .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
bye .
hello ?
alicia . hi , sorry . it &apos;s will .
i know you just got home ,
but i just got a call from memorial north .
the hospital ?
yeah . we signed them a month ago .
you have your own in the other room .
would you both stop arguing about the computer ? !
exactly . so tell grace ...
this is ridiculous .
the administrator called .
seems like they got a bit of a fluid situation over there
involving a possible malpractice suit .
a possible one ?
yes . i think they &apos;re being overcautious ,
but they just came off a million @-@ dollar malpractice payout ,
so we jump through hoops .
they got a call ten minutes ago from a paramedic
coming in with a heater .
a heater ?
a high @-@ profile patient .
i don &apos;t have all the details , but it sounds like an od to me .
i need someone to get over there ,
make sure if this does turn into a malpractice suit ,
we got our ducks in a row . okay ?
look , i know we &apos;ve been asking a lot of you lately .
so , if you want me to put this on cary , i can .
no . i &apos;ve got it .
thank god . i thought he was sending out cary .
what &apos;s going on ?
ben bowers ,
gables high star quarterback ,
usu recruit , collapsed on the field .
how &apos;s he doing ?
i think we &apos;re going to find out now .
mrs. bowers ...
time to go to work .
i &apos;m so sorry ...
get corporate compliance , hr , pr .
no , i have outside counsel .
um , code was called at 8 : 35 .
in @-@ house called police .
8 : 45 . they &apos;re on their way .
one shoe ?
where &apos;s the other shoe ?
police are five minutes away .
is that his bag ?
uh , the paramedics brought it in .
&quot; dr. wesley . &quot;
is that the attending physician ?
yes .
is he on staff ?
yes .
what ?
80 milligrams .
where &apos;s your doctor ?
wesley ? i &apos;ll locate him . why ?
you got 80 milligrams oxycodone in a 17 @-@ year @-@ old .
if you want to know when this went south ,
this just went south .
cops are two minutes away .
they take a half hour to call in detectives .
another half hour to find these pills .
doctor &apos;s got about 90 minutes before he gets arrested .
i have to get the board together .
first , get to your doctor
and make sure he exercises his miranda .
i &apos;ll go with .
kalinda .
somehow i should &apos;ve expected it .
murphy .
got here fast .
it &apos;s a heater on a friday night .
what do you expect ?
so you been documenting the scene ?
yep .
yeah ? don &apos;t suppose you want to focus my eyes on the salient details ?
now where &apos;s the fun in that ?
damn .
is that dr. wesley ?
i &apos;m so sorry , mrs. bowers .
i &apos;m just so sorry .
he was only 17 .
how ... how does this ... ?
i don &apos;t know .
i want to see him .
i understand .
dr. wesley .
may i speak to you for a moment ?
please .
do i know you ?
i &apos;m alicia .
i &apos;m a lawyer with stern , lockhart &amp; gardner .
you can &apos;t be talking with the mother right now .
why not ?
your patient overdosed from pills you prescribed .
and there is some question about the dosage .
even a simple expression of sympathy
could be construed as an admission of guilt .
then it &apos;s an admission .
that &apos;s my patient . i &apos;m their family doctor .
and i &apos;m your lawyer .
if i was sick right now , i would do exactly as you told me to do .
but you &apos;re in trouble .
and i need you to do exactly as i tell you .
i @-@ i &apos;m in trouble ? the police think ... ?
please .
where &apos;s your office ?
the south tower .
i want you to go there .
don &apos;t speak to anyone .
i know this is going to be difficult ,
but promise me , please ...
i &apos;d never put ben in harm &apos;s way .
if you &apos;re my attorney , i want you to know that .
this is going to be huge , isn &apos;t it ?
the press , people ...
block it out .
alicia , right ?
yes .
i &apos;m shawn .
we &apos;ll speak soon .
he &apos;s a florrick kid .
you got to give him a minute .
you sure you &apos;re going to be warm enough there , zachary ?
this is laya .
zach ! zach ! come here , zach !
zach !
she had a stroke .
she &apos;s still unconscious , but stable .
which hospital ?
harbor .
the kids couldn &apos;t get through to 911,
so becca drove them there .
becca ?
she &apos;s zach &apos;s friend . it &apos;s a long story .
she @-@ she drove , so she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s 16 .
zach was sneaking out to go to a concert .
i already talked to him .
i need to get out of here .
okay .
look , there &apos;s an excellent neurologist ,
his name is dr. hester ,
and he &apos;s at st. michael &apos;s .
you need to get him over to harbor to evaluate her .
he &apos;s going to tell you that he &apos;s busy ,
but you just say to him that i &apos;d greatly appreciate it .
i phoned your sister .
i bet that went well .
she wants updates .
i &apos;m going to have golden apply for a sick bed visit .
we &apos;re going to need a critically ill notification
from the attending physician .
and unfortunately ,
we bear the cost of a supervised visit .
could be ... a couple thousand .
you need to see her .
thank you .
how are you ?
i &apos;m ...
it &apos;s been a busy 48 hours .
i found someone to fill in at home .
she had good references .
and ,
i &apos;m going to take over jackie &apos;s power of attorney , for the time being .
of course .
so i just need you to sign ...
and just , initial the next page .
you and golden can talk about it later .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
this is just odd .
i started the day with one lawyer , and now i have ten .
your issues are our issues , shawn .
thank you for posting my bail .
for standing by me .
of course .
we want to see you cleared .
now , due to the popularity of the victim ...
ben .
yes , ben .
we believe the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office is guilty of legal overreach .
they have charged you with murder ,
which is a sign of their desperation .
it &apos;s a charge aimed at headlines .
isn &apos;t that bad ?
hi .
no , it probably means they don &apos;t intend to bring it to trial .
they just want to get a plea bargain with some jail time .
any jail time .
which we won &apos;t accept .
right . we just need to make them aware of the facts .
you prescribed the ten @-@ milligram painkillers ,
but not the 80 @-@ milligram .
that &apos;s right .
good .
so we just need to find where these other drugs came from .
our team will do some digging ,
cut this off before it goes to trial .
no way .
you cannot be here .
hi , murphy .
yeah , how did you even get in ?
hi , li .
kalinda . we miss you .
what &apos;s that , stomach contents ?
don &apos;t answer her .
looks like you ran into the one cop
who can resist your charms , kalinda .
tell him about my sweet personality , li .
blueberries and sesame seeds .
flax seeds and bananas .
li , what did i just say ?
so ...
what &apos;s your take on the florrick appeal ?
i just keep my head down ,
someone ends up signing the checks .
in a street fight , my money &apos;s on florrick .
same here .
so , was it the oxycodone , li ?
and alprazolam , ephedra .
kid &apos;s got a pharmacy in his stomach .
li , shut up .
see how easy that was ?
take care .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m so sorry , mrs. bowers .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just trying to piece together what happened .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re trying to protect the doctor who killed my son .
thank you .
i know your first instinct would be to slam the door in my face ,
but i ju ...
he was a good boy .
you should be trying to fight for him .
i just want to know the truth .
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re a lawyer .
everyone &apos;s painting my son as some kind of drug addict .
and everyone &apos;s painting dr. wesley as some kind of pill pusher .
so help me .
help me figure out how ben got those drugs in his system .
i &apos;m not sure what you want to hear .
my son didn &apos;t hang around with drug dealers .
i know , but maybe a friend ,
or the football coach ...
no .
i knew all the people in his life .
kids aren &apos;t always forthcoming .
ben didn &apos;t really have the time .
i mean , he was either at school or @-@ or @-@ or practice or the gym .
i mean , that was his life .
maybe it was too much . i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a single mom .
you know , you can &apos;t ... see everything .
you can &apos;t ...
be there all the time .
when they fall ...
i was reading a story
by one of the moms of the columbine killer .
and i thought to myself ,
&quot; oh , my god .
i understand . &quot;
molly . everything okay ?
doing great .
grace is in her room ,
and , um , zach &apos;s friend becca is here .
really ?
where are they ?
well , actually ,
i asked them to stay in the living room ,
if you don &apos;t mind . i just felt more comfortable with that .
yes . thank you .
and mrs. florrick is there anything you don &apos;t eat ?
because i &apos;m making a lasagna ,
but i can make it meatless if you want .
no , anything &apos;s fine , molly .
thanks .
okay . i was just checking in .
look , maybe he od &apos;d on the oxycodone ,
but where did the alprazam and ephedra come from ?
is that the stomach contents ?
and his last meal .
flax seeds , blueberries and bananas .
what &apos;s the history on the hospital parking er patients ?
what do you mean ?
you know , making them wait .
no , i know what &quot; parking &quot; means ,
but what do you mean ?
the missing shoe .
i found it in an empty er ward .
i was wondering if they had parked him .
you do know the hospital is our client .
yes .
but if they &apos;re vulnerable ...
then we deal with that .
what did you get from his mom ?
not much .
ben didn &apos;t do much more than study , work out .
what gym ?
um , iron muscle . why ?
flax seeds and bananas .
sounds like a power smoothie .
yeah , gym &apos;s a good place to score some ephedra .
i read an article .
something you can &apos;t do yourself ?
poor little me .
i need a man .
she wanted to get engaged right out of law school .
her dad &apos;s patrick j. brown .
you know who that is ?
no .
eh , well , he &apos;s fortune 500 , semiconductors .
but i said no .
i mean , 26 and married .
cary , you know i &apos;m not listening to a word you &apos;re saying , right ?
here , let me spot you .
are you seeing someone ?
okay , when they go into the locker room ,
don &apos;t approach them .
just watch the exchange
and i &apos;ll make the approach later .
i &apos;m sorry , did you hear my question ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
do i have a boyfriend ?
yeah .
no .
i have the stuff you were asking about .
that &apos;s all of it ?
it looks different .
new mix . you &apos;ll love it .
all right . looks good .
later .
hey , let &apos;s say i want to bulk up .
what ?
let &apos;s say i want to bulk up , i want to pay for it .
you got anything for me ?
sure .
first one &apos;s free .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s homemade acai berry supplement .
i don &apos;t sell drugs .
all right .
well , if you think of somebody who does ,
here &apos;s my number .
thanks , man .
yeah .
a wiretap ?
right .
how reliable is your source ?
reliable . it &apos;s alicia .
childs &apos; ex @-@ wife told her .
all right , um ...
assuming that it &apos;s true ,
and i file a motion to compel production of the taps ,
whatever is on those taps will come out .
right .
the good and the bad .
i mean , if there is anything on those tapes ,
that will work against us ...
well ...
that &apos;s a lot to consider .
and if you could just help me with your handwriting here .
yeah , sorry , wretched penmanship &apos;s a job requirement .
uh , patellar .
uh , analgesic .
thank you , alicia .
for ?
for keeping this from feeling like it &apos;s spinning out of control .
you said you saw ben before he went to school .
that &apos;s when you prescribed the oxycodone ?
yes .
but ... your shift didn &apos;t start until 10 : 00 that morning .
oh . right .
i saw him at home before i went to work .
he had an appointment scheduled for noon ,
but didn &apos;t want to miss class .
give me a minute .
diane ?
he prescribed prescription narcotics to a teenager out of his house .
and then went into work and updated ben &apos;s chart
as though there were an official hospital visit at noon .
he said he would &apos;ve prescribed the exact same thing out of the office .
it &apos;s a game @-@ changer .
as far as i &apos;m concerned .
good job .
thanks for discovering it .
so , you want to walk away ?
the prosecution can argue there was no valid doctor &apos;s visit .
there &apos;s a falsified medical record .
so , do you want to walk away ?
i think it &apos;s the smart thing to do .
please let dr. wesley know
the hospital can no longer be involved in his defense .
sorry to hear about your divorce .
thank you .
i was being sarcastic .
i want your help .
with ?
the florrick appeal .
prior knowledge to evidence he &apos;s bringing ,
where and how he &apos;s getting it , from whom ...
how many investigators do you have
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office , glenn ?
you have special knowledge from working with him directly .
that was a long time ago .
i have a different job now .
you can work two .
how much ?
no money .
i don &apos;t think you understand how exposed you are
from your past work with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
subpoenas stopped at florrick
only because i wanted them stopped at florrick .
you &apos;re trying to tie me to his scandal .
you are tied to his scandal .
i am offering to keep the record sealed
if you give me what i want , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what happened to my issues being the hospital &apos;s ?
i don &apos;t think i can answer that .
so i prescribe from home .
it was a minor infraction .
it wasn &apos;t anything unusual .
if a patient needs help ,
i give it regardless of where ...
it &apos;s a relief for them , isn &apos;t it ?
the hospital isn &apos;t liable anymore , i am .
i can &apos;t really afford you without the hospital &apos;s support ,
but i could ... pay you in installments .
you want me to continue ?
i could end up with a public defender who ...
i &apos;d rather stick with you .
but the hospital dumped you because of me .
so make it up to me .
dr. wesley knows you &apos;re the one who brought this to us ?
yes . if north memorial waives conflict ...
that &apos;s a big &quot; if . &quot;
it &apos;s still best for them if dr. wesley is cleared ,
especially if they &apos;re vulnerable on other questions .
on his own dime ?
but it &apos;ll just be you .
we &apos;ve already reassigned kalinda and cary .
okay .
jackie ?
you look good .
well , i &apos;m just trying to get some life back in me .
what ?
what did i do now ?
whenever you &apos;re given a compliment ,
you take it as criticism .
no , i don &apos;t .
anyway , thank you for phoning me .
well , i @-@ i just ... i ...
you &apos;re welcome .
so , uh ...
you hired this girl molly to watch grace and zach .
yes , i did .
i don &apos;t like her .
really ?
i know that look .
you think i don &apos;t like her because she &apos;s taking my place .
yes , i do .
she &apos;s pushy .
she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s a know @-@ it @-@ all .
peter &apos;s going to try and get out to come see you .
you trying to make me feel good ?
yes , i am , but it &apos;s true .
take these with a full glass of water , mrs. florrick .
what are these orange ones ?
five milligrams warfarin .
how can you be sure ?
a practiced eye .
not to worry .
dropping off or picking up ?
actually , i was wondering if you could help me , jill .
my mother @-@ in @-@ law is very nervous about taking her pills ,
and i need to explain
how pills are prescribed and dispensed .
do you mind ?
she &apos;s such a nuisance .
sure .
so , aren &apos;t you breaking the rules , having me in here ?
the door &apos;s open .
aren &apos;t you breaking the rules , having me in here ?
what do you want me to do ?
what do you want me to do to you ?
does she do this for you ?
does she ?
it &apos;s ...
your dad &apos;s sex tape ?
say ...
&quot; just don &apos;t stop . &quot;
say it .
just don &apos;t stop .
molly ?
you know zach and becca are in his room ?
they wanted to play some music , so i said it was all right .
i don &apos;t think my mom wanted them to .
it &apos;s okay .
zach just needs a little bit of , um ,
independence and trust right now .
i don &apos;t want to infantilize him .
want to help me with dinner ?
sure .
it &apos;s all about tracking and barcoding .
when we take 20 pills out of stock ,
we scan the prescription bottle to log the pills ,
then scan the stock bottle .
in theory , it all reconciles at the end of the day .
in theory ?
well , not everyone is diligent .
some think when we &apos;re busy , they can just skip the barcoding .
when the computer reminds them , they just manually override the warning .
is there any way you could tell me
if a certain prescription has been barcoded ?
was it filled here ?
you have the rx number ?
my mother @-@ in @-@ law , she takes pictures of all her pills .
i know . it &apos;s a bit anal .
b. bowers .
four ten @-@ milligram oxycodone .
see ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
not barcoded .
terrible .
i am plea bargaining . your doctor &apos;s dirty .
there &apos;s nothing linking ...
he prescribed ben bowers oxycodone ,
and ben bowers died of an oxycodone overdose .
that &apos;s a link .
and you have a task force
looking into pill pushers at local gyms ,
one of which ...
is peter holding up okay ?
peter ?
yes . how is he ?
i ... he &apos;s fine .
we have an associate looking into one of these pill pushers
at ben &apos;s exact gym ...
i can do one year in jail .
suspended medical license .
no .
i &apos;m sorry ?
one year probation , no jail time .
dr. wesley prescribed ten @-@ milligram pills for ben .
and the pharmacy may have dispensed incorrectly .
may have ? really ?
are we playing &quot; may haves &quot; ?
check with the pharmacy . they didn &apos;t barcode the transaction .
for all we know , they gave him 80 @-@ milligram pills by mistake .
that &apos;s reasonable doubt .
go ahead . give them a call .
i &apos;ll wait .
so , here we are again .
yeah , here we are .
you know , i &apos;ve only been fired once in my life .
you still holding a grudge ?
giving you a chance to correct a mistake .
but my rates have gone up .
well , what are your qualifications ?
childs asked me to work for him .
to do what ?
outbid him .
we have some funds , but , um ...
we &apos;ll need to know the nature of the information you could supply .
childs tapped my home .
we don &apos;t want to subpoena those tapes
unless we can preview them .
without him knowing ?
so , i think you should accept childs &apos; job offer .
work for him .
and for us .
that should be a familiar feeling for you .
i always did like you .
i think i &apos;m in love .
this doesn &apos;t feel like good news .
when i gave you the go @-@ ahead to represent dr. wesley ,
i thought you knew not to sacrifice a major client for a minor one .
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t say anything about the parking .
were you aware that
middle woods pharmacy is owned in part by memorial north ?
no .
you gave the asa information
suggesting the pharmacy was at fault in ben &apos;s death .
i pointed out that their inventory method left a gray area ,
which is true .
well , true or not , the pharmacy is now under investigation ,
and memorial north wasn &apos;t too happy
to have their own firm point a finger at them .
they fired us .
this is our fault .
and we should have seen the potential for conflict .
but put dr. wesley &apos;s case to bed .
make the best deal you can and get it off your docket now .
you asked me to follow upon the information .
as part of dr. wesley &apos;s case ,
not to launch a new one against the pharmacy .
i felt it was my professional duty to follow through .
by the way , the pharmacy may not have barcoded ben &apos;s prescription ,
but they also didn &apos;t have 80 @-@ milligram oxy in stock that day .
you just lost reasonable doubt .
if we could get his jail time down to four months ,
instead of a year ... ?
that was yesterday &apos;s deal . it &apos;s four years now ,
and a revoked medical license .
so , we take it to trial .
if that &apos;s what you want to do ,
i can help find you a lawyer to step in .
what ?
why ?
my firm has asked me to settle this
or help you find new representation .
four years in prison , i ...
my life would be over , my career .
i need a vacation .
yeah .
he &apos;s facing four years in prison ,
the loss of his job ,
and you know what ?
i didn &apos;t care .
you ?
i wanted his problems out of the office .
what &apos;s that say about me ?
says you &apos;re becoming a lawyer .
i &apos;m amazed at how little i know about you .
what do you want to know ?
i &apos;m not sure .
great .
two things .
i looked at the paramedic &apos;s run sheet .
you &apos;re right , the times don &apos;t add up .
looks like they parked ben for 15 minutes .
that &apos;s pretty damning .
but privileged .
yeah , only if we represent them .
right now , we don &apos;t .
you want to blackmail the hospital to make them our client again ?
i like it .
yeah , strategic .
second thing &apos;s even better .
the gym guy
wants to sell me some oxycodone .
are you and grace in therapy ?
in ... ? no .
family therapy .
all this stuff with your father .
that ... no , we &apos;re fine .
it can have a serious effect on your psychosexual development .
i don &apos;t even think about it that much .
zach , you &apos;ve got pictures on your computer of your dad
with a hooker and a crack pipe .
how do you ... ?
what are you talking about ?
i saw them when i was checking my e @-@ mail .
does your mom know ?
don &apos;t tell her .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on here .
dinner in ten minutes .
so , homemade acai berry supplement .
yeah .
did you try it ?
no , not my speed .
it &apos;s good stuff .
sometimes you need a little more .
you got knee pain ?
yep . stay awake at night crying .
oxycodone isn &apos;t cheap .
well , try me . i got a good job .
these 80s ?
yep .
how much ?
twenty .
how much for ten ?
200 .
and for a first @-@ time customer , i &apos;ll throw in a free vike .
all right .
you sure you don &apos;t need some &apos; roids ?
just looking at your muscle mass , you could do with some .
what &apos;s wrong with my muscle mass ?
nothing wrong with my muscle mass .
hold it right there ! oh , no , you don &apos;t !
don &apos;t move !
see how good i am at repaying favors ?
what do we have here , the proverbial black book , hmm ?
these all your customers ?
don &apos;t i have the right to remain silent ?
you recognize one ?
you sold to ben bowers ...
the high school football player who od &apos;d .
you sold to him .
no , i never sell to kids .
what a humanitarian .
stop lying .
it &apos;s here .
mrs. bowers , being too formal ?
yes , trey sold to me .
i met him at the gym .
th @-@ things were just really hard .
my job and stress .
ben never knew about it .
he didn &apos;t have access to these , i swear .
i counted them .
there are exactly 11 .
may i ?
look .
they look identical .
but kids take aspirin tablets ,
shave off the markings and ridges , round the edges
so they look like oxy tablets .
see ?
then they swap out the real oxy with the fakes
so it looks like no pills are missing .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
so you two are good , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
yeah .
why ?
