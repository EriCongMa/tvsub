supplies . be quick .
take anything of value .
spartacus .
you leave his cock to the sun ?
no . i send a message .
to an old friend ...
第一集
pompey was a fool to engage sertorius absent support .
when has pompey ever delayed action in favor of reason ?
advancing in years yet ever the adolescent butcher .
where youth plummets , maturity may soar .
rome will lose all of hispania
if pompey &apos;s numbers are not shored against the renegade .
and who would lead such a force to glorious accolade ?
freshly minted praetor , perhaps ?
i serve the republic , marcus .
we will take arms against her enemies if so commanded .
the embellished robes of a praetor not yet to wrinkle ,
and yet he speaks of war and laurels .
i speak only of pressing matters .
we need not tread foreign soil to find them ,
do we , varinius ?
not when spartacus and his mongrels continue to evade capture .
the man is no longer bound to my concerns .
more of young seppius &apos; men were slaughtered
on the road outside capua .
he sends word to me that one of the fallen bore your name ,
carved into his chest .
an unfortunate tether .
quickly to be severed .
cossutius awaits my attentions .
apologies to your daughter ,
that i could not linger to gaze upon her .
disappointment to be tempered with promise of future visit . hm .
come , let us break meal --
the consuls will present a motion
dispatching you to capua at once .
this is a simple tumultus , albinius .
undeserving the attentions of a praetor .
you brought the thracian to roman soil , gaius .
you granted patronage to that grinning shit batiatus a breath
before his house fell to massacre .
a massacre my daughter barely fucking escaped .
varinius lends his support to seppius .
if he is the one to bring spartacus to justice ,
then that victory will be used to embarrass you .
attend to this .
or see yourself rise no further within the senate .
don &apos;t lower your sword !
eight more romans !
sent to the afterlife !
peirastes !
replace wood with steel , for those who are ready .
vitus !
pyrrhus ! lysandros !
divide these among you according to skill .
and ready the rest for demonstration .
spartacus . we need food .
not more weapons .
steel and coin are all they carried .
crixus &apos; men fare better .
rhaskos .
where is crixus ?
he seeks marcellus , the cunt peddler .
your men have done well for themselves .
see everyone to equal portion .
fuck !
you have more than enough .
gained by blood and risk .
what do they do but lay about ?
divide what you have .
i will not ask again .
fucking gauls .
rhaskos is a selfish fool .
unable to see beyond his own desires .
no one will go hungry tonight .
that is all that matters .
and tomorrow ?
will bring death to yet more romans .
i would see all of them struck down .
yet not at the cost of your life .
i have proven troublesome to kill .
there is no one that stands your equal .
yet for those less skilled ,
moving towards the mountains in the east would be sorely welcome .
game is plentiful there .
and roman numbers sparse .
it would be wise .
then why do we stay ?
what holds us here ,
so near capua and the threat --
spartacus .
i hear you wish to command my men ?
no .
simply to remind them of what is just .
you would have done the same , had you been present .
i shall have words with them .
they would be better received from your lips .
you were in town again ?
you risk discovery .
i was not seen , except by marcellus .
and he will never speak of it .
did his blood bear fruit ?
a name .
trebius .
the slaver ?
he will point towards her ?
marcellus revealed that he brokered deal of naevia .
where do we find him ?
he frequents capua upon each moon , to trade his wares .
and to wet his cock at arminius &apos; brothel .
news to lift the heart .
it remains firmly bound , until naevia is back in my arms .
i will have those words now .
crixus ?
have you had sight of doctore ?
the ludus was his life &apos;s blood .
to lay eyes upon those who have spilled it ...
it would salt mortal wound .
you fight like a woman ! fucking kill him !
a poor showing .
apologies , magistrate .
these were the best that could be procured .
the crowd demands spectacle , mercato .
they must be distracted , lest the city fall to ill temper and panic .
gladiators and games .
while spartacus and his murdering horde roam free .
your brother has the matter well in hand , seppia .
words of comfort .
to the eight of his men slaughtered this morning .
eight ?
apologies .
pressing business conspired to delay me--
is it true , seppius ?
eight more of your men , fallen to spartacus ?
a thing of little note .
spartacus will soon be brought to terms .
and our beloved cousin sextus avenged .
or you to join him ,
leaving me woefully unattended .
what form of brother would i be ,
to abandon such cherished blood ?
a poor showing .
i have nothing of worth .
we seek only words .
i am absent them as well .
you were batiatus &apos; man , were you not ?
you are mistaken .
oenomaus , he was called .
it is fortunate you are not him .
the man stands accused of turning upon his dominus .
the reward for his capture is a substantial sum .
towards spartacus yet higher .
if he were to be revealed ,
a man such as you could continue not being himself .
as i said , i have nothing of worth .
a lesser sum then .
apologies .
you are not batiatus &apos; man .
you should not be outside .
i wanted to see the moon .
janus loves to gaze upon it .
varro would hoist him upon his shoulders
and he would stretch his hands out ,
attempting to wrest it from the heavens .
perhaps one day he shall .
but not upon his father &apos;s shoulders .
janus is yet too young for memory to take proper hold .
i doubt he would recall the sight of me now .
you are his mother .
years would not lessen such a bond .
he will burst as sun through clouds , at the sight of you .
i have dreamt of nothing else since our parting .
mira speaks of the mountains , to the east .
i have thoughts dispatching men to hunt for game .
your brother tends to janus not far from there , does he not ?
the moon within closer reach .
i would shorten the distance .
you think i have not longed to have it so ?
to be far from all of this ?
i am branded fugitivus with the rest of you .
what life could i offer my son beneath such shadow ?
none .
within the republic .
all the coin i have relieved the romans of since our escape .
enough to buy you and your son passage ,
far from these shores .
spartacus ...
varro &apos;s last words were of you and janus .
that i see you cared for .
they need not have been spoken .
send word to crescentia that
i must move our mid @-@ day meals later in the week .
and respond to varus &apos; request
for our presence at his celebration .
we will not be attending .
i know you do not care for the man ,
yet he is well connected .
we must make appearance .
it &apos;s your father would have it otherwise .
he dispatches me to capua .
to deal with spartacus .
i will have word with him .
he is set upon it .
you are a praetor , gaius .
hunting errant slaves is beneath you .
yet it must be done .
but i promise we will return to roman well
before our child enters this world .
we ?
you will accompany me of course .
i will not .
out .
i am bound to the house of batiatus by patronage .
granted only to bury knowledge of the blood staining your hands .
what happened to licinia was an accident .
she was cousin of marcus crassus !
she was a fucking bitch !
all who knew of the deed
speak no more .
let us put it behind us .
i intend to .
now make preparations .
we leave for capua .
and an end to the curse of spartacus .
you believe the words of marcellus ,
bleated from tongue with sword to neck ?
crixus moves on arminius and his place of whores .
and i will be at his side .
so we follow the fucking gaul now ?
i swore aid in the matter .
you did not .
i would not think less , if you stayed from it .
i am with you .
you had me at whores .
avoid unnecessary risk ,
and provoking words towards the gauls .
peirastes leads the hunt for game .
he will have you safely to your son &apos;s arms .
from where you have been too long absent .
see your boy to a man .
that i may one day greet him as a brother .
i will tell janus of you .
of the man who loved his father above all others .
she takes to foot ?
long overdue .
as are many things this night .
this is not your fight , spartacus .
i gave my word . blood and honor .
it yet speaks to the man .
then let us split darkness with the cries of romans .
go !
trebius !
where is trebius ?
where !
get off the fucking floor !
no !
get off the fucking floor ! bitch !
trebius .
i would have words .
i would not .
no !
your man ?
more guards ! we need--
trebius . you fucking cunt !
agron--
this is the roman shit that sold me and duro to batiatus .
my brother would be alive if it were not for him !
he knows the whereabouts of naevia .
we will take him and go .
he will not last .
i need but a moment .
then you shall have it .
the man meets his end .
that is all that matters .
you brokered the sale of a woman from the house of batiatus .
dark of skin ,
the mark of the domina upon the back of her shoulder .
where is she ?
fuck yourself .
i am already dead .
there is yet life in you yet .
speak , and see it ended quickly .
south ?
there are villas and farms , far from the city .
and naevia was sold to one of them ?
no . she was handed from dominus to dominus .
a gift from batiatus , to secure favor on his campaign for fucking aedile .
these places you speak of .
how heavily are they guarded ?
it would not matter if the gods stood watch .
how many villas are there in the south ?
over what spread of distance ?
how will you know if naevia &apos;s even located in one of them ?
only a few are owned by men of note .
cocks batiatus would have sucked to further his cause .
to be exposed , in the open .
we must proceed with caution .
you ? advising caution ?
the tempest shouts for the breeze to calm itself .
what good will your death be to naevia ,
if we do not pause to think ?
she has been from my arms too long .
i do not have time to sit and ponder .
none of us do now .
what is your meaning ?
with his last breath , trebius frothed of roman ,
and the death that has been dispatched from her bosom ,
to wash us away in rivers of blood .
soldiers ?
arriving with the sun .
who leads them ?
the city is in a panic .
scores were slaughtered in the raid against arminius .
halt !
see the men fed and rested .
squads to sweep the countryside by nightfall .
your will , praetor .
fall out .
bring supplies .
do you have enough men for this ?
it does not appear you have enough men .
they face only slaves .
not hannibal at the gates .
they are gladiators .
led by spartacus , the slayer of the shadow of the--
where is the magistrate ?
i would discuss this with someone of note .
he is otherwise detained , in view of last night &apos;s--
he sends apologies .
seppius however is eager for audience .
the man has praetor varinius &apos; ear .
i have no desire for his tongue to fill mine as well .
i would address the people , put their minds to ease .
tomorrow as the sun rises in the marketplace .
what will you say ?
attend to the arrangements .
yes , praetor .
why have i been brought here ?
gaius , why have i been brought here ?
to this house ?
the hilltop offers excellent vantage of the surrounding country .
the ludus below will easily garrison my men .
then use it as such .
i will remove myself to my father &apos;s villa .
you will stay at my side .
now , set the house to order .
this is our home now , ilithyia .
until spartacus falls .
i want everything in this fucking house seen over the cliff .
we will purchase a new appointment much coin .
if my husband would have me here ,
he can certainly pay for the comfort .
and see all traces of blood cleansed .
it reeks of batiatus and his faded bitch .
go ! go !
yes , domina .
what has happened ?
in matters concerning my wife ,
the gods themselves fear to speculate .
have you lost wit ?
speak .
you should have sent word you were coming ...
we would have prepared a feast .
lucretia .
you see it then ? you see it ?
naevia ! bring wine for our honored guests .
kill it . kill it , kill it !
praetor !
this is batiatus &apos; wife ?
a shadow of the same .
and yet she lives .
to be spared from such carnage ...
a blessing from the gods .
one that would calm a city , if it were known to be such .
naevia !
apologies .
i do not know where she &apos;s gone .
why do you pause ?
she could prove a powerful symbol .
it would give the city hope ,
to see a woman survive spartacus and his men .
and courage to confront them ,
speeding your return to rome .
gaius .
you cannot let her live .
see her bathed and tended .
and what fragments her shattered mind yet holds .
the roman army ? !
we are all of us dead !
grab your fucking cock !
we never wanted this .
you gladiators , you will see us all to our end !
you little fuck !
agron !
we knew this day would come .
some have feared its approach .
others have longed for it .
yet few have grasped deeper meaning .
that this moment ,
was always fated to be so .
i made promise .
to all of you , when the house of batiatus fell .
that we would see rome tremble .
you are the ones that shall quake .
i have witnessed glaber and his men entering the city .
enough in number
to end your lives .
then stand with us , and balance the odds .
mercato has announced glaber will make address
in the market as day breaks .
it would be wise to use the distraction ,
and leave such thoughts behind .
doctore ...
that is no longer my title .
where do you go ?
there is but one place .
for an animal without honor .
he is lost to us .
how many more would you have follow ?
join with us , brother .
we can head south , while glaber cups his balls and makes speeches .
he &apos;s the reason i am here .
and my wife forever absent .
you often preach to me about caution .
turn advice now towards self .
we are ready .
house slaves , playing at being men ?
they are not gladiators .
they are not an army , as much you wish it to be so .
sleep upon it , spartacus .
but when the sun rises , i would see reason dawn .
water .
how did we come by it , with the drought ?
the drought is long past .
do you not recall its ending ?
it is of no concern .
come , i would have you dry and seen to proper dress .
your wound .
wound ?
how did you come by it ?
leave us .
it must have been terrible .
trapped within these walls ...
your beasts running wild ...
everyone believed you dead ,
smashed upon the cliffs ...
bits of bone and flesh
your only testament .
how did you survive , all alone ?
lucretia ...
we are friends . are we not ?
the very best .
and you have so many .
aemilia .
caecilia .
licinia .
cousin to marcus crassus ...
it would be a very great honor to be seen at her side .
would you make introduction ?
let us see you dressed .
ilithyia .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you are with child !
quintus and i have been trying for such a long time .
this is a sign .
a sign from the gods .
life blossoms in the house of batiatus ...
this is why we are yet in capua .
why you saw aurelia away .
you hoped they would send glaber .
no .
i prayed for it .
and what do you pray for now ?
to the gods you do not believe in ?
would your wife have wanted this ?
to see her husband consumed ?
there are many things she would not have wanted .
and yet they are so .
follow crixus to the south .
do not let your vengeance claim so many you have saved from bondage .
i would not see another life forfeit to my desires .
we will find naevia .
and move far beyond grasp of rome .
far from the name spartacus they have branded you with .
let us turn thought from uncertain future .
and embrace fleeting moment ...
get up !
move to fucking purpose .
be ready when word is given .
you bark as a dominus .
sheep stand idle , if not prodded by snapping jaw .
get up ! !
does the maw of a pup spur the same ?
let us compare teeth , and have answer .
cease your quarrels .
i am for spartacus , and the lay of his thoughts .
last night they were towards heeding caution ,
and joining you in the south .
and the light of morning ?
he was gone from our bed when i awoke .
there is no cause for rising concerns !
the situation is well in control !
what of arminius ? !
is that fucking control ? !
no .
it was an act of savagery ,
committed by animals who know nothing more .
these same beasts laid waste to the house of batiatus .
many were lost that night .
women of proper standing .
men of honor and position .
my own cousin sextus ,
your beloved magistrate of years past ,
among the dead .
he speaks the truth !
at the hands of butchers , who crave only blood and death .
and they shall see it returned in kind .
but spartacus leads them !
even theokoles fell before him !
he &apos;s the bringer of rain !
spartacus is but a man !
and not all fall to his touch .
the wife of quintus lentulus batiatus
stood against the merciless assault of spartacus and his dogs !
and by favor of the gods ...
she yet lives !
it &apos;s a miracle !
gods be praised !
it is a blessing !
you stand eclipsed .
she is their herald ,
plucked from the shores of the afterlife to deliver a message !
that spartacus shall never triumph
over the people of capua !
he comes ...
he comes ...
he comes ...
still yourself .
and yet the gods grace us with further signs
that spartacus &apos; end is near !
get rid of her !
gut the cunt !
my men came upon a clutch of batiatus &apos; slaves ,
attempting harm in the mountains to the east .
this one is all that remains among the living .
before she succumbs to her wounds ,
i will force her tongue to purpose .
and with her dying breath ,
she will tell me where spartacus and his men hide themselves .
and they shall be struck ,
from this mortal world
by the hand gaius claudius glaber !
preening little shit .
i rather favor him .
thank you .
surround him !
cease him !
spartacus !
cease him !
take aurelia and go !
take him !
you cannot win this !
no !
stay , and see vengeance forever denied .
you are no better than rhaskos and the fucking gauls .
all driven only by your own desires .
do any of us hold fucking worth to you ?
the reason i went alone .
a hard comfort , if you had fallen to glaber &apos;s men .
agron would have led you south .
we need a leader .
not some angry boy who can barely piss
without splashing everyone about him .
what would you have me do ?
turn from the man that condemned my wife to slavery ?
let him live ,
that took everything from me ?
your heart still beats .
place ear to chest ,
and you will find it absent sound .
and yet you are not dead .
because of you .
know that you have my gratitude--
i didn &apos;t come to lend you aid , you mad fuck .
i came to stop you .
you would place yourself between glaber and what he deserves ?
as you would place yourself between naevia and me .
what do you think would be the result
of killing a fucking praetor ?
the senate would burn upon itself ,
belching forth fire and vengeance .
they would not send a few men , as they do with glaber .
they would send thousands .
a true army .
which we will never be .
aurelia calls for you .
spartacus ...
i am here .
promise ... me ...
anything .
promise ... you will stay far from my son .
i would not have him die in your wake ...
as his father and mother ...
glaber and his men will pay in blood .
gather swords--
no .
we move south .
to find naevia .
let crixus and the other gauls chase lost hope .
spartacus -- - the decision &apos;s been made .
we must stand as one .
or fall divided .
a lesson hard learned .
shackle will be struck from every slave upon our path .
we will see our numbers grow .
and when they have become legion ,
we will face glaber ,
and the hordes of rome again .
