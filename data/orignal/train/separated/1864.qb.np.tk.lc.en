from a broken home in the next room .
i ...
both versions start the same way , though .
both start with two people falling in love .
yeah , you can .
just look at me .
it &apos;s just you and me .
dude ... you snore like a truck .
i &apos;m gonna put a note in your chart ,
&apos;cause you mix apnea with your heart crap ,
and you &apos;re dead before you &apos;re 60 .

oh , i hope so .
oh . new interns .

good morning ,
and welcome to your fifth year of residency .
oh , morning .
morning .

i hear there &apos;s an omelet station .
thank you . okay .
you have a good day .
okay , now . bye @-@ bye .
okay , um , i &apos;ll see you later ...
okay .
at the thing .
she slept through the night ...
hey , zola .
and ate like a champ .
i missed you .
can we talk ?
i want to spend time with zola
before i drop her off at day care .
are you gonna call glen today ?
i don &apos;t know .
i , you know , the--the guy is an ass .
do i really want to work for him ?
maybe you should stop being so choosy .
well , i just got laid off four months ago . all right ?
i mean , these things take time .
it &apos;s all about pursuing leads and making connections .
i know how a person gets a job , danny .
i have one , remember ?
good morning , and , uh ,
welcome to your final year of residency .
um ...
this--this breakfast is the one time
when all the fifth years and the attendings will be in the same room ,
so ... so use your time wisely , residents ...
find a mentor ...
ask questions , get advice on your futures .
and , um , i see you &apos;re already chatting away ,
so that &apos;s--that &apos;s good .
just carry on .
dr. bailey , how did you do it ?
i put down the english muffin first ,
then the bacon , then the eggs .
oh , no--
now some people may be surprised by this method ,
thinking you put the bacon on top of the eggs ,
and those people
would be right , because ...
you see what i &apos;m doing ?
bam !
an extra layer of bacon
right on top .
then you put on the other half of the muffin .
and there you go . that &apos;s a breakfast sandwich .
uh , no , no , i , uh , i mean ,
how did you get people to listen to you
as chief resident ?
dr. kepner , i am eating . leave me alone with my food .
figure it out on your own .
did he talk to you ?
no , he won &apos;t even look at me .
well ... you tampered with his clinical trial .
he thinks that &apos;s kind of unforgivable .
it was for adele and the chief--
you know , i know you--
you regret that you messed up his trial
but not what you did , i know .
you don &apos;t have to defend yourself to me .
i &apos;m kind of ...
unforgivable myself , remember ?
but you &apos;re not . not yet at least .
have you told him ?
well ...
i call him , he doesn &apos;t pick up .
he sees me , he walks away .
okay , i &apos;m not gonna yell
&quot; i didn &apos;t get the abortion yet &quot; down the hallway .
well , so are you going to go through with it ,
or are we gonna sit there again and not get the abortion ?
tonight . 6 : 00 . i &apos;m doing it .
gotta go suck up to teddy .
you want plastics ?
i don &apos;t see it .
is this about lexie ?
&apos;cause i thought you were good with that .
this isn &apos;t about sex . it &apos;s about medicine .
then i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re a good surgeon .
not a great surgeon ,
which is why i was surprised lexie was even into you .
but this isn &apos;t about lexie .
nope .
how &apos;s she doing , by the way ?
god . what is she doing here ?
i don &apos;t ... what ?
is what you &apos;re thinking , right ?
i mean , you thought that i would run away to germany
and you wouldn &apos;t have to see me again ,
which was a relief , i mean ,
after all the drama that we &apos;ve been through in the last year .
i &apos;m right . tell me i &apos;m right .
i ...
okay , so here &apos;s the deal -- i &apos;m here
and i &apos;m in a happy place and i &apos;m done with drama .
so if you want to learn , i want to teach .
great .
yay .
alex , this is serious .
if you want the peds fellowship next year ,
you &apos;re gonna have to earn it .
i just brought over a bunch of sick kids from africa .
well , did you publish and article about it ?
because all the people applying for peds fellowships ,
they &apos;ve all been published .
you &apos;re already getting resumes ?
yes , and you &apos;re way behind .
listen , i hate to kick a guy when he &apos;s down , but--
down ? who &apos;s down ? i &apos;m not down ?
everybody hates you because you narced on a fellow surgeon .
you &apos;re a pariah . you &apos;re living in the hospital ,
and you look like a bum and you &apos;ve ...
got really bad breath .
really ...
really bad .
do you need me to go on ? i ...
no , i &apos;m good .
look , here &apos;s the chief !
chief ,
is there , uh , anything you &apos;d like to say
as we embark on our final year of residency ?
you all know what you &apos;re doing .
just don &apos;t kill anyone .
meredith , can i see you in my office ?
well , that w--that was very ... inspirational .
thank you , chief .
nobody gets married thinking it &apos;s gonna fail .
well , you &apos;re the one who needed the big wedding .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means , if we still had our savings ,
my being laid off wouldn &apos;t be such a big deal .
no , we decided on that together .
we both wanted that wedding .
no , we didn &apos;t .
you and your mother are the--
stop the car .
calm down .
i mean it , danny .
you &apos;re being crazy .
what , are you gonna walk to work from here ?
what the hell are you doing ?
stop the car !
you think yours is the one that &apos;s gonna make it .
derek &apos;s refusing to work with me , isn &apos;t he ?
the board met this morning .
they feel that a suspension
would send the wrong message .
they feel that what you did
disgraced the hospital ...
the profession .
i &apos;m sorry , i did everything i could .
so what are you saying ?
you &apos;re fired ,
effective immediately .
you &apos;re no longer a doctor at seattle grace .
and so it always comes as a shock ...
the moment when you realize , it &apos;s over .
you walk away , and i swear , that &apos;s it .
all right , i am not gonna chase after you .
you get out of this car , and we are done .
susannah !
one minute you &apos;re standing on solid ground .
the next minute you &apos;re not .
we &apos;re going to the scene of an onsite amputation
woman &apos;s trapped under her car .
you guys are gonna get swamped with bodies .
kepner , you &apos;re in charge till i get back .
yes , sir . have fun .
at an amputation ?
i meant good luck .
you know what ? there &apos;s bound to be piles of head trauma .
derek &apos;s gonna have to talk to you .
i got fired .
what ?
the chief fired me .
you son of a bitch .
i mean , are you happy now ?
&apos;cause this is all because of you .
you and your big fat , stupid mouth !
get off me . get off !
kepner , control your people .
stop ! stop !
all your fault !
get off .
there &apos;s no hitting . no hitting .
would you stop right now ?
you going to the scene ?
yes .
wait . wait . i didn &apos;t tell you you could go . i need you here .
42 @-@ year @-@ old female . lost consciousness en route .
unable to get airway secondary to tracheal injury .
last b.p. is 89 over 60 .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll figure something out .
make sure there is a crike tray set up with the intubation kit .
yes , doctor .
come on . you can &apos;t be here . you need to go .
it &apos;s not stable . get away from there .
dr. torres ?
yeah .
dr. hunt ?
karen lorenz , in charge of search and rescue .
we &apos;re still pulling victims out of the debris ,
but we have a couple-- danny and susannah wilson--
stuck down there .
he has a head wound and his ankle &apos;s messed up ,
but i don &apos;t see any other obvious injuries .
we could potentially bring him up ,
but he won &apos;t leave without his wife ,
and her leg is stuck under the car .
take it easy . you &apos;ll be all right .
i hope you &apos;ve got me with a decent resident .
i &apos;m not babysitting any first @-@ day first years today .
yep , i got you with meredith .
coming through .
wait . um , that &apos;s not gonna--that &apos;s okay .
uh , not a problem . i can fix this .
uh , jackson , can i get you with bailey today ?
i &apos;m already with sloan . sorry .
uh , okay . uh , yang . yang .
can i get you to ...
no .
okay .
um , sorry . hang on .
let me just , um ... just figure this out .
hey , grey . you &apos;re with me .
yes , ma &apos;am .
uh , okay . great . there we go .
dr. kepner , three more coming in .
okay .
it was a water main break on 3rd .
probably been going on for weeks , and it just gave way .
here you go .
thanks .
we &apos;ve got a vitals monitor and a camera ,
so we have a visual .
danny , can you hear me ?
she &apos;s--she &apos;s not talking anymore .
you gotta--you gotta get down here . we need help .
danny , danny , i &apos;m dr. hunt .
can you read out for me the top three numbers on the monitor ?
87 .
63 .
122 .
b.p. &apos; s 87 over 63 .
she &apos;s shocky . how do we get down to her ?
you don &apos;t . it &apos;s too unstable .
the whole thing would cave in if we sent you down there .
by the time we get it shored up enough
to get someone down there , she &apos;ll be dead for sure .
i thought that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , for the amputation .
you &apos;re gonna talk him through it .
you want him to cut off his wife &apos;s leg ?
hey , you guys , i think she &apos;s dying .
you gotta get us outta here ! please hurry . hurry !
dr. yang , can you tell me why you entered the pleura
with a kelly clamp ?
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
am i too low ?
do you suspect a traumatic herniation ?
no , no . i just want to know you &apos;re thinking .
&apos;cause that &apos;s how you put a chest tube in .
why ?
what do you mean , why ?
so you don &apos;t kill the person when you do it wrong .
well , tell me like i &apos;m an idiot .
uh , like i &apos;m a medical student .
why ?
i need to make sure that your foundation is solid .
why ?
i &apos;m asking the questions , cristina , not you .
tell me why you entered the pleura that way .
what ? is zola all right ?
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s ... she &apos;s fine . it &apos;s me .
i have to go .
derek .
meredith , i can &apos;t . i just--i ...
i got fired .
what did you think was gonna happen ?
danny , you &apos;ve got a kit .
now they &apos;re sending down a second harness .
the doctors are gonna talk you through this , okay ?
okay .
what can i do ?
kepner called . she wants you back at the hospital .
i can &apos;t go back there .
yeah , it sucks that everyone hates you ,
but you &apos;re not hiding out here . go .
did you get the kit open ?
almost .
oh , my god . no .
no . no , no . no , no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t do this .
danny , danny , you can do this .
we have one chance to bring you both up .
in order to do that , you have to amputate susannah &apos;s leg .
oh , no . no .
oh , god . oh .
i need a c @-@ spine !
coming through , people . come on . watch your back .
you guys headed back ?
yeah , we are .
does anybody have a kid ?
has anybody seen a kid around ?
where &apos;d they pull this guy from ?
we &apos;ll need immediate transport for her .
yeah , give me just a minute here , doctor .
i just gotta stabilize her .
i need some help over here !
he &apos;s not breathing .
get an ambu bag and some oxygen over here .
right away , doctor .
oh , jeez . what happened ?
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no . i need help .
i @-@ i think my patient &apos;s coding .
you think your patient &apos;s coding ?
what &apos;s his rhythm ?
s.v.t. ?
sinus tach ?
okay , there shouldn &apos;t be a question mark at the end of that sentence .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m freaking out .
it &apos;s my first day of internship . how could this be happening ?
go back to your patient . does he have a pulse ?
he has a pulse .
good . now check for breath sounds .
uh , i kinda hear some ,
but maybe the right sounds less ?
you gotta stop with the questions .
it kinda looks like he &apos;s barely breathing at all now .
move , move , move .
tension pneumothorax . grab the biggest needle you can find .
what are you doing ?
tension pneumo . this guy &apos;s freaking out .
step away , grey .
uh ... 14 @-@ guage ? 16 @-@ guage ?
the biggest needle you can find !
okay . get this man a chest tube .
and next time , call your resident .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i thought that she was a resident .
no , she is not a resident .
she was fired by this hospital .
had this man died under her care ,
the hospital would be sued . you would be sued .
hell , maybe even i would be sued .
now get this man a chest tube , and , grey ,
get the hell outta here .
pulse is not good . his breath sounds are shallow .
his name &apos;s nicky hoffman .
pulse is minimal on this side , too .
come on , nicky . i need you to do better than this .
thready pulses ,
multiple rib fractures with decreased respirations .
his body &apos;s shutting down .
could be compartment syndrome .
that could be why his radial pulses are so decreased .
we need to do bilateral fasciotomies
and relieve the pressure .
do we have a scalpel ?
push 5 of morphine .
got it .
okay .
all right .
okay , you do the fasciotomies .
you &apos;re the fifth year .
all right .
okay , his pulse is stronger now .
good . do the other one .
sponge .
here you go .
thank you .
nice job . you got this ?
yeah , all right .
hey .
hey , nicky . i &apos;m alex .
i &apos;m a doctor .
you had a pretty bad accident .
we need a gunther .
dr. bailey , it &apos;s the first day of fifth year .
and they &apos;re at each other &apos;s throats .
we need a gunther .
i &apos;ve got more pressing problems .
i &apos;m trying to find a new spot for meredith grey .
you know , i heard they have a new research fellowship
at mass gen.
i thought a recommendation from you might--
you want me to write a recommendation
for meredith grey ?
by the end of the day would be fine .
&quot; to whom it may concern ,
&quot; meredith grey is an excellent example
&quot; of the kind of resident
&quot; you absolutely should not hire .
&quot; she undermines groundbreaking clinical trials ,
&quot; she has absolutely no respect for rules , authority ,
&quot; or , as it turns out ,
&quot; the oath that she took when she became a doctor .
&quot; she will most likely tarnish the reputation of you ,
&quot; your doctors , and your hospital .
sincerely , dr. miranda bailey . &quot;
meredith grey is the reason
we need a gunther .
jerry hoffman .
c.t. showed a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage .
i cleaned and splinted his humerus fracture
and sutured his facial lacerations .
well , he won &apos;t need surgery , but let &apos;s do a neuro exam
every two hours just to make sure .
let &apos;s take a look at your handiwork .
oh , dear god .
my grandmother could sew up a stuffed turkey ...
better than this .
it was ...
pretty , uh , jagged in there , so--
you ever heard of burying your stitches ?
all right .
so i will fix it .
oh , jackson .
there &apos;s a new patient in bed 3 .
kinda busy , april .
yeah , kinda busy turning this guy into frankenstein .
go . go . make yourself useful .
all right , i &apos;m gonna fix this .
mm @-@ hmm .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re being a little hard on the kid ?
he &apos;s a lightweight .
be thankful you have meredith .
she was fired .
she okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
mr. hoffman ? dr. shepherd .
you &apos;re at seattle grace hospital .
there was an accident . a sinkhole collapsed .
my son ?
nicky &apos;s on his way in .
he &apos;s had some severe injuries that they need me to assess ,
but i promise you , i &apos;m gonna take good care of your son .
nicky hoffman , sustained crush injuries
and was very unstable in the field .
robbins is holding a trauma room .
we called shepherd from the field .
which one are they in ?
oh , god . i @-@ i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
well , find out .
well , it &apos;s supposed to be on the board .
people , i need you to make sure you &apos;re updating these boards .
april , i need you to reassign these cases .
uh , yang , take over meredith &apos;s cases .
no .
cristina .
i &apos;m with altman ,
and meredith should keep her cases .
i am your chief resident .
you have to do what i say .
april , it &apos;s fine .
i can wait . just sign them when you have a minute .
you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
i was fired .
so what are you gonna do about it ?
you have to go talk to the board .
the board fired me .
yang .
what are you doing ?
i presented as thirsty ,
so ... treated the symptoms with 8 ounces of water .
now that i &apos;m finished ,
i will place this bottle in the recycling bin
so as to avoid excess strain on seattle &apos;s landfills .
that &apos;s funny . you &apos;re a funny girl .
come on . we have patients .
you need a plan . come up with a plan .
okay , now pour on that brown soap .
and pick up the thin silver knife .
good .
okay , now here &apos;s the thing--
you &apos;re gonna have to really put your weight into it .
try for smooth cuts , okay ?
okay .
now you see that area just below the tourniquet ?
that &apos;s where you &apos;re gonna cut .
do it horizontally , as deep as you can .
are ... are you ...
are you--are you sure she &apos;s not gonna feel anything ?
no , she &apos;s unconscious , danny . she won &apos;t feel a thing .
okay .
i @-@ i can &apos;t .
danny ...
take that blue towel
and cover her face .
it &apos;ll help .
all right , now remember to put your weight behind it , okay ?
here we go .
one ...
two ...
three .
oh , god !
oh , god !
ah . i @-@ i hit-- i hit bone .
i @-@ i think i hit bone .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
okay , put the scalpel down now .
now take the curved clamp
and move it back and forth beneath the bone .
god . god , i @-@ i can &apos;t . uh , it--it won &apos;t--
put your hand in the incision to get more traction .
i can &apos;t .
danny , i know this is hard ,
but we need to create more space
so you &apos;ll be able to saw through her bone .
no , i-- no , i @-@ i can &apos;t .
okay ? this--this is my wife . all right ?
i @-@ i--i &apos;m gonna kill her .
she &apos;s bleeding now--
danny , you can &apos;t stop .
no , you need to come down here . i can &apos;t do this .
i won &apos;t do this !
i &apos;m going down .
no , dr. hunt , i can &apos;t let you go down there .
he can &apos;t do it .
yes , he can .
he can &apos;t . we are asking too much .
i &apos;m going .
if it starts to go ,
i &apos;m bringing you--
i should go . i &apos;m the orthopedic surgeon .
you have a wife and a child .
i &apos;m going .
you &apos;re breaking up . can you repeat that ?
what ?
i have a plan .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna be a mom .
okay ... mer , there &apos;s a giant sinkhole .
teddy is all over me .
don &apos;t page me 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 unless you have a serious--
this is serious .
maybe getting fired was a good thing .
what do you cheerful people say
when something crappy happens
and they make it sound like it wasn &apos;t crappy ?
a blessing in disguise ?
yeah . maybe that &apos;s what this is .
this is that .
and i can ...
make jam and drive car pool
and have playgroups .
and maybe that &apos;s enough .
and maybe i &apos;ll be a great mom .
okay . okay . i &apos;m gonna go vomit .
uh , call me when meredith comes back .
and maybe you want to be a mom , too ,
and that &apos;s why you can &apos;t go through with it .
i wish i wanted a kid .
i wish i wanted one so bad ,
&apos;cause then this would be easy .
i would be happy .
i &apos;d have owen ,
and my life wouldn &apos;t be a mess .
but i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want a kid .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to make jam .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to carpool .
i really , really , really don &apos;t want to be a mother .
i want to be a surgeon , and please ...
get it .
i need someone to get it .
and i wish that someone was owen .
i wish that--that--that at any minute ,
he &apos;ll get it and show up for me ,
but that &apos;s not gonna happen .
and you &apos;re my person .
i need you to be there at 6 : 00 tonight
to hold my hand ,
&apos;cause i am scared , mere ,
and sad ,
&apos;cause my husband doesn &apos;t get that .
so i need you to .
i am a terrible person .
i know , awful .
i got meredith &apos;s surgeries .
i &apos;m reaping joy from the fact that my sister got fired .
a terrible person wouldn &apos;t feel terrible about reaping the joy .
oh , uh , jackson , jackson ,
i need you to take over on a couple of these .
i can &apos;t .
i have to see a man about redoing some sutures .
please .
i &apos;ll take one .
thank you . bed 4 .

uh , right .
zola , peekaboo .
peekaboo .

i need to stabilize his spinal fracture .

keep her head safe , all right ?
all right .
i couldn &apos;t do it . i c--i couldn &apos;t--
i couldn &apos;t do it . i couldn &apos;t .
danny , you did it .
you did the hard part .
all right ?
now , danny ...
danny , look away .
all right , she &apos;s free . good job .
i &apos;m gonna finish up ,
and we &apos;ll both be right behind you .
all right ?
take him up .
meredith , what &apos;d you say to janet ?
nothing . why ?
i just finished answering a whole slew of questions
about zola &apos;s sleeping arrangements .
she &apos;s finishing her home study .
that &apos;s routine .
okay , there was nothing routine
when she said that there were inconsistencies with our stories .
what did she say ?
she said that she spoke to you and that some red flags went up .
well , i did see her earlier , but i didn &apos;t say anything .
i gotta go . i got a surgery .
well , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll talk to janet and i &apos;ll--
no . don &apos;t . don &apos;t do anything .
don &apos;t talk to her . i will talk care of this .
you &apos;ve already ... don &apos;t talk to her .
dr. sloan , i think you &apos;re gonna be really impressed
by the buried sutures i did here .
after you .
that is impressive . it is .
gender reassignment , huh ?
normally they don &apos;t teach that till next year .
that &apos;s a mistake . this is not--
call me when you find the right patient .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
hey , uh , i need you to prep trauma 1 .
we got another sinkhole victim on the way .
stop asking me to do your work . do it yourself .
and how about you tell me where jerry hoffman is ?
jerry hoffman ?
um , uh , well , he &apos;s supposed to be in bed 1 .
that &apos;s what the board says . he &apos;s not there ?
does it look like he &apos;s there ?
oh , wait . wait . that can &apos;t be right ,
&apos;cause if the patient from bed 2 is in bed 1 .
hen that means the patient from bed 3 must be ...
oh , no .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
the patient is mr. chuck wallace .
he &apos;s having a splenectomy secondary to
injuries sustained in the sinkhole .
yes , dr. grey ,
let &apos;s move on before my patient bleeds out .
okay , i &apos;m almost ready dr. bailey .
i just have to have the nurse
show me the consent form as part of the checklist .
scalpel .
wait a second .
dr. grey ,
you &apos;re sterile . what are you--
okay , hold--hold on .
wait a minute . i &apos;m--
i think that there-- something might be ... off .
i &apos;m thinking that maybe this is ...
not our patient .
then whose patient is it ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
i just--i--
you don &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m holding a scalpel in my hand .
i think you had better find out .
stop ! don &apos;t cut !
uh , it &apos;s the wrong patient .
that &apos;s mr. jarvis , who needs a lung resection ,
not mr. wallace with a splenic hemorrhage .
i @-@ i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ i am so , so sorry .
would you make sure this gets to
the medical staff office , please ?
yes , doctor .
meredith .
what ?
nothing .
grey , we &apos;ve got a guy with severe crush injuries ,
and callie &apos;s come in with a field amputation .
let &apos;s move .
we gotta get these trauma rooms ready--
i got fired .
okay ? i got fired .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know .
yeah , well , now you know .
i have to go . i have a ...
owen .
she didn &apos;t have the abortion .
she wants to and she can &apos;t do it because of you ,
because she loves you .
and instead of loving her ,
you &apos;re punishing her .
for what ?
for being the woman that you fell in love with ?
this isn &apos;t any of your business .
okay ,
do you know what will happen to cristina
if she has a kid that she doesn &apos;t want ?
it will almost kill her .
trying to pretend that she loves a kid as much as she loves surgery
will almost kill her ,
and it &apos;ll almost kill your kid .
do you know what it &apos;s like to be raised by someone
who didn &apos;t want you ?
i do .
to know you stood in the way of your mother &apos;s career ?
i do .
i was raised by a cristina .
my mother was a cristina .
and as the child she didn &apos;t want ,
i am telling you , don &apos;t do this to her ,
because she &apos;s kind and she cares
and she won &apos;t make it .
the guilt of resenting her own kid
will eat her alive .
all right . coming through .
no one was updating the board ,
even though i kept telling them to .
i know , i know . i @-@ i @-@ i have to make people listen to me ,
but in all fairness
i &apos;ve been chief resident for 12 hours , and--
and yes . a man could &apos;ve lost-- his perfectly good spleen ,
but he didn &apos;t ,
because the checklist i implemented .
not that-- that excuses what happened , i--
it &apos;s okay , just--
yell at me .
i can take it .
it &apos;s okay .
no , i @-@ i--i can-- i can take it .
really . i @-@ i swear , i can take it . i--
how deep are you placing the tube ?
21 centimeters
exactly .
hallelujah , i &apos;m in .
great .
now explain why you chose that size endotracheal tube .
because i &apos;m in my fifth year of residency
and i know what size tube to use for a basic intubation .
why are you treating me like a first year ?
because no one ever did .
i bet your first year ,
you could do things better than most third years .
well , yes , i could . why are you punishing me for it ?
i &apos;m happy .
that makes me see you differently .
your arrogance is not your fault .
you &apos;re arrogant because you &apos;re so good .
people let you slide by , skip steps .
they gave you the hard stuff
but let you skip the easy stuff .
i have no doubt that you can tell me
how to do a coronary artery bypass .
but i &apos;m not sure that you can tell me
why you chose that size endotracheal tube .
look , i know what you heard ,
but meredith grey is one of the most qualified ...
yeah , i understand .
yeah . thank you for your time .
not now , karev . i &apos;m in no mood .
you need to get meredith her job back .
what do you think i &apos;ve been doing ?
i &apos;ve spent the whole morning trying to get her a job .
meredith doesn &apos;t need a job .
she needs this job .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
the board &apos;s already made their decision .
let me talk to them .
i mean , maybe i don &apos;t know what i saw .
maybe i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i lied
to get the chief resident--
i can &apos;t let you say that .
oh , the hell you can &apos;t .
karev , this is not on you .
yeah , it is .
it &apos;s all on me .
looks perfect , jerry .
second time &apos;s the charm .
sutures look a lot better .
really ?
that &apos;s great .
no . no , no . not great .
better .
which isn &apos;t saying much considering the crappy job
you did the first time .
you--you just said it looked a lot better , s--
this guy just fell into a sinkhole ,
his kid &apos;s in surgery ,
and now he &apos;s got a scar
to remind him of this terrible day
for the rest of his life .
you want to go tell him that ,
big shot ?
go ahead .
dr. sloan .
is nicky out of surgery ?
uh , dr. avery was just about to go check on that .
wait . bailey paged you , too ?
any idea why ?
who cares ?
as long as it gets me away from altman .
oh , god .
she &apos;s gonna fire us , isn &apos;t she ?
why would she fire us ?
there was that patient mix @-@ up in the o.r.
oh . you should be fired .
me ? you guys didn &apos;t update the board .
that &apos;s why she looks so pissed off .
that &apos;s not good for it .
uh , let me see that chart .
what is she looking for ?
what have you got ?
a field amputation with complicated extrications .
still assessing her multiple crush injuries ,
but i felt a broken pelvis for sure ,
and her b.p. &apos; s in the toilet .
yeah , this is a gunther .
really ?
really .
think they can handle a gunther ?
oh , i think they need a gunther .
uh , what &apos;s a gunther ?
hey . i got your message . what &apos;s up ?
we should wait till your husband gets here .
you paged derek ?
well , he &apos;s in surgery . that could take hours .
can &apos;t you at least tell me what this is about ?
i could tell something was up
when i ran into you at zola &apos;s day care
so i made some calls .
it would have been better
if you told me that you had been fired
and that you and dr. shepherd were living apart .
but i can explain--
i &apos;m sure you can .
but you understand my concern .
so--so what happens now ? worst @-@ case scenario .
let &apos;s not even go there .
well , they couldn &apos;t take zola , right ?
i &apos;m not really comfortable
discussing this without your husband .
well , this is urgent , so i &apos;ll go get him
and i will be right back .
do you have what it takes ?
if your marriage is in trouble , can you weather the storm ?
when the ground gives way ...
and your world collapses ...
he &apos;s losing his s.s.e.p.s ,
push i.v.steroids.
maybe you just need to have faith ...
scrub in . i need you .
i just got your page .
and trust that you can survive this together .
maybe you just need to hold on tight ...
oh , what did i do ?
what did i do ?
and no matter what ...
what did i do ?
don &apos;t let go .
