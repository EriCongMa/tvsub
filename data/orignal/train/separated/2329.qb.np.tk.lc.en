for over a century , i have lived in secret
until now.i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
elena-- she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
that necklace contains herb called vervain .
it protects you from being compelled .
our love with katherine wasn &apos;t real , damon .
i &apos;m gonna bring her back .
there was a tomb underneath the church .
the spell sealed katherine in that tomb , protecting her .
hello , jenna .
logan .
who are you ?
a friend of jenna &apos;s .
alaric saltzman .
i &apos;m your new history teacher .
banister showed me this-- i &apos;m a witch .
his face was like ...
are you ok ?
what &apos;s going on elena ?
i &apos;m going to tell her the truth .
i know that you think
that you brought all of this bad stuff into my life ,
but my life already had it .
this is different .
i know what i want .
i &apos;ve never been in your room before .
this room holds every memory that i ever thought
was important enough to hold on to .
elena ?
elena , it &apos;s stefan .
i know that picture must confuse you ,
but i can explain .
i need to explain . so please , when you get this ,
call me .
how ya doing in there ?
damon ?

let me get you out of here .
i want you to put your hands on the roof .
just like that .

can you stand ?
anything broken ?
you &apos;re fading fast , elena .
elena .
look at me .
focus .
look at me .
i look like her .
what ?
upsy @-@ daisy .
i found one .
after years of reseah and study ,
there it was right in front of me .
i was terrified .
as i stared it in the eyes ,
i drove a stake through its heart .
i was right about mystic falls .
there is evil here .
i can sense it .
feel it .
it &apos;s everywhere .
it &apos;s not even 7 : 00 yet .
which means you shouldn &apos;t be awake for at least 6 hours .
i hate morning people .
i &apos;m going to be home tonight .
i love you .
and i love you , too .
morning .
where are we ?
georgia .
georgia ?
no , no . no , we &apos;re not .
seriously , damon . where are we ?
seriously , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re in georgia .
how ya feeling ?
i--i--
there &apos;s no broken bones . i checked .
my car . there was a man .
i hit a man .
but then he got up and-- who was that ?
that &apos;s what i would like to know .
where is my phone ?
ok . we really need to go back . nobody knows where i am .
pull over .
i mean it , damon . pull over !
stop the car !
oh . you were so much more fun when you were asleep .
i &apos;m fine .
we have to go back .
oh come on . look . we &apos;ve already come this far .
why are you doing this ?
i can &apos;t be in georgia . i wrecked my car .
i have to go home .
this is kidnapping .
that &apos;s a little melodramatic ,
don &apos;you think ?
you &apos;re not funny .
you can &apos;t do this . i &apos;m not going to georgia .
you &apos;re in georgia .
without your magical necklace i might add .
i can very easily make you
... agreeable .
what are you trying to prove ?
that &apos;s my phone .
mmm . it &apos;s your boyfriend .
i &apos;ll take it .
elena &apos;s phone .
where is she ?
why do you have her phone ? is she ok ?
elena ? she &apos;s right here .
and , yes , she &apos;s fine .
where are you ? let me speak to her .
he wants to talk to you .
yeah . i don &apos;t think she wants to talk to you right now .
damon , i swear to god , if you touch her ...
you have a good day .
bye @-@ now .
look . no one knows where i am .
can we please just go back ?
we &apos;re almost there .
where is there ?
a little place right outside of atlanta .
oh , come on , eena .
you don &apos;t wanna go back right now . do you ?
what &apos;s the rush ?
time @-@ out .
trust me . your problems are still going to
be there when you get home .
step away from your life for 5 minutes .
5 minutes .
am i going to be safe with you ?
yes .
will you promise not to do
that mind control thing with me ?
yes .
can i trust you ?
get in the car . come on .
hey , mr. saltzman .
hey , jeremy . i , uh--can &apos;t find my ring .
i took it off for the gym .
and thought i put it ...
there it is .
losing family heirlooms ... bad .
how &apos;s your extra credit coming ?
you pick a topic yet ?
mystic falls , the civil war era .
what &apos;s the angle ?
my family .
i found a journal of an ancestor
who lived in the 1800s .
and the gilberts were one of
the original founding families of mystic falls .
so ...
that sounds good .
bonnie .
stefan .
i haven &apos;t seen you lately .
how are you doing with everything ?
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s all fine .
good .
are you back in school ?
no . actually i came here to find you .
i was hoping you could help me with something .
a spell .
stefan .
i know elena &apos;s ok with all of this ,
and i appreciate what you did to help me .
but i &apos;m not really ready to dive into it with you just yet .
i understand .
but i need your help .
it &apos;s elena .
she &apos;s with damon .
i have elena &apos;s necklace .
i have elena &apos;s necklace .
i was just hoping you could use this
to make some sort of a connection .
i just need to know that she &apos;s ok .
how do you know i can do this ?
because i &apos;ve known a few witches over the years .
i &apos;ve seen what they can do .
i &apos;m still new at it .
it &apos;s ok .
give it a shot .
ok .
all right .
there &apos;s nothing .
nothing &apos;s happening .
usually there &apos;s an image or ...
tell me if anyone &apos;s looking .
ok .
what is it ?
something &apos;s wrong .
with elena ?
with me .
there &apos;s something wrong with me .
i have to go .
i &apos;m sorry , stefan . i can &apos;t hp you .
so , where &apos;s my car ?
i pulled it off on the side of the road .
i don &apos;t think anyone will bother it .
what about that man in the road ?
was he a ... ?
from what i could tell . yeah .
you didn &apos;t know him ?
if i &apos;ve never met him , i wouldn &apos;t know him .
i mean , it &apos;s not like we all hang out together at the
vamp bar and grill .
where are we ?
you brought me to a bar ?
damon , i &apos;m not old enough . they &apos;re not going to let me in .
sure they will .
no . no , it can &apos;t be .
damon .
my honey pie .
listen up everybody .
here &apos;s to the man
that broke my heart , crushed my soul ,
destroyed my life
and ruined any and all chances of happiness .
drink up .
so ... how &apos;d he rope you in ?
i &apos;m not roped in . actually i &apos;m dating his ...
honey , if you are not roped , you &apos;re whipped .
either way , just enjoy the ride .
ok .
so how did you two meet ?
college .
you went to college ?
i &apos;ve been on a college campus , yes .
about twenty years ago ,
when i was just a sweet , young freshman .
i met this beautiful man .
and i fell in love and then he told me about his little secret .
made me love him even more .
because you see i had a little secret of my own that
i was dying to share with somebody .
she is a witch .
you changed my world , you know .
i rocked your world .
he &apos;s good at the sack , isnt &apos; he ?
but mostly he &apos;s just
a walkaway joe
so ...
what is it that you want ?
oh my god . i am so sorry .
there was this one book wedged between the other .
and i pulled and then kaplunk , kaboom .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m anna .
i &apos;m jeremy .
thank god you &apos;re back .
and hello to you , too .
what &apos;s the matter ?
my powers are gone , grams .
i can &apos;t do anything ,
even when i concentrate .
and there &apos;s nothing in any of these books
that can tell me how to get them back .
hang on , now . just calm down .
tell me what happened .
i can &apos;t .
we keeping secrets now ?
i have to . i &apos;m sorry . i promised .
please help me .
well , first of all , there &apos;s nothing in any of these
that &apos;s gonna help you .
if you &apos;re blocked , it &apos;s in here .
you gotta clear it out
then you &apos;re back in business .
clear what out ?
whatever &apos;s got you so scared .
hi , jenna . i &apos;m so sorry .
where are you ?
why didn &apos;t you call ?
i was so tired last night .
i fell asleep at bonnie &apos;s .
and then this morning , i just wanted to get to school .
are you ok ?
you know , stefan and stuff .
come on ,
there &apos;s gotta be another way .
after all these years , it &apos;s still only katherine .
how do you even know she &apos;s still alive ?
well , you help me get into that tomb and
we &apos;ll find out .
i already did .
20 years ago . remember ?
3 easy steps-- comet . crystal . spell .
there &apos;s a little problem with number 2 .
i don &apos;t have the crystal .
that &apos;s it , damon .
there is no other way . it &apos;s emily &apos;s spell .
what about a new spell
with a new crystal that overrides emily &apos;s spell ?
it doesn &apos;t work that way , baby .
emily &apos;s spell is absolute .
you can &apos;t get into that tomb .
come on .
hello ?
anybody here ? !
elena , is that you ?
i &apos;m here .
where are you ?
you lied .
not until i explain , please .
so , you didn &apos;t lie ?
just tell me where you are . so that i can come get you .
how am i connected to katherine , stefan ?
i honestly don &apos;t know .
and i &apos;m supposed to believe that ?
it &apos;s the truth . i--
listen--
you ok ?
don &apos;t pretend to care .
i know you &apos;re gloating inside .
hey , it &apos;s bree .
you &apos;ll never gonna guess who walked into my bar .
hello ? !
anybody ? !
hi .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m stefan . i &apos;m a friend of bonnie &apos;s .
her dad told me that she might be here .
she was . not anymore .
do you know where she went ?
no . but you do .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i told her to face down her fear .
and i &apos;m sensing now that
you know exactly why she was scared .
you know what i am .
and yet you offered me your hand ,
which means you wanted me to see that i can trust you .
can you ?
i trust you &apos;ll keep her safe .
you &apos;d better be on your way , then .
i &apos;m not going to invite you in .
i &apos;m sure you understand why .
this aisle is local and state history .
and civil war is one over .
what do you need ?
local . 1860s . do you work here ?
nope .
you want reference . this way .
uh , home @-@ schooled . i study here for a moc school environment .
ah , here we go .
original settlers , town archives ,
founders stuff . it &apos;s all here .
so , what &apos;s your topic ?
the town &apos;s fear and hysteria surrounding the war
and how it influenced certain writers of the time .
you might want to focus that .
the origin of local folklore and myths .
you mean the vampires ?
let &apos;s just say that i &apos;m descended from katherine--
does that make me part vampire ?
vampires can &apos;t procreate .
but we love to try .
no . if you are related ,
it would mean katherine had a child before she was turned .
did stefan think that he could use me to
replace her ?
it &apos;s kinda creepy if you ask me .
come on , what ? you don &apos;t like pickles ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
how can you even eat ?
if technically you &apos;re supposed to be--
dead .
it &apos;s not such a bad word .
as long as i keep a healthy diet of
blood in my system ,
our dody functions pretty normally .
this nice act .
is any of it real ?
here you go .
thank you .
i &apos;ll have one too .
time out , remember ? for 5 minutes ?
yeah , well that 5 minutes is going to need a beer .
there you go .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ? there &apos;s no such thing as vampires .
well , there &apos;s not a lot of documentation
but the stories have been told since the civil war .
my granddad used to tell meall these creepy stories when i was little .
and he said that his granddad told them to him .
yeah . that would be folklore .
vampires are a metaphor for the demons of the day .
which are ?
the union soldiers . i &apos;ve read the stories myself .
i read those stories myself . they talk about the enemy ,
the demons that attack night .
that sounds like vampires to me .
allegorical vampires .
which is what it is .
creative expression during a very volatile time .
i mean , a country at war doesn &apos;t want realism .
they want fantasy .
thus , vampire fiction .
man
you &apos;re smart .
i gotta give it to you . when i first saw you ,
i missed it .
yeah . i &apos;ve
had a rough go of it lately.but
i &apos;m just now getting back to my old self .
well , good luck on the paper .
i gotta get home .
you know , my great grandfather
actually showed me a journal once of an ancestor
and he had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires .
it was actually really believable .
wait . a journal ?
yeah ? why ?
are you sure you have to go ?
come on , phone !
great !
get away from me !
it &apos;s me . it &apos;s stefan .
stefan .
the ground gave way and i fell .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . calm down .
come on , let &apos;s get you out of here .
how ?
just close your eyes .
trust me .
you can open your eyes now .
i didn &apos;t want to scare you .
how did you know where i was ?
well , your grandmother told me what you were doing .
i guessed the where .
i heard them .
down there .
behind the door .
are they in pain ?
in the beginning--yes . but not anymore .
they &apos;ve been starved to the point of dessication .
but if they have blood--
that &apos;s not going to happen , bonnie .
they can &apos;t get out .
emily saw to that when she had you destroy the crystal .
you &apos;re safe .
ready ...
go !
that &apos;s 3 .
do you need a bib ?
sorry i can &apos;t unhinge my jaw like a snake to consume alcohol .
whatever . all right .
who &apos;s next ?
another round , bree .
honey , you should be on the floor .
i am not even drunk .
my tolerance is , like , way up
here .
all right , here you go .
so , you have no idea where the journal is ?
nope , gramps died and all the kids split his stuff .
i can ask .
i just find it weird that our ancestors kept the same kind of journal .
it &apos;s crazy .
maybe it &apos;s based in some partial reality .
no , it &apos;s gotta be a metaphorical .
my ancestor wrote short stories .
so , that &apos;s why you &apos;re hung up on the fiction of it all .
no , i &apos;m hung up on fiction of it all
because i &apos;ve seen &quot; the lost boys &quot; and &quot; near dark , &quot;
like , 50 times .
are those movies ?
hey . i &apos;ve never seen them .
maybe we can have a fright night
and rent a whole bunch of vampire movies .
uh , yeah , sure .
why does it sound like a no way in hell ?
sorry , i &apos;m blunt .
no , it &apos;s--
i don &apos;t want you to get the wrong idea .
i just recently got out of something ,
it &apos;s a little too soon , you know ?
oh please , sure . no worries .
i meant as friends . yeah .
look , i really gotta go .
nice meeting you , jeremy .
hello ?
elena
jenna ? hold on , it &apos;s loud in here .
elena , where are you ,
are you ok ?
yeah . no , i &apos;m good , eveything &apos;s fine .
hold on , i can &apos;t hear you .
hello ?
hey , where &apos;s your girl ?
hmm , she was right back there .
damon , no .
what t hell ? !
no !
who are you ?
that &apos;s perfect .
you have no idea .
what are you talking about ? what did he do ?
he killed my girlfriend .
what did she do to you , huh ?
what did she do to you ? !
nothing .
i don &apos;t understand .
my girlfriend went to visit stefan ,
and damon killed her . got it ?
lexi ?
lexi was your girlfriend ?
she told me about you .
she said you were human .
i was .
lexi turned you ?
if you want to be with someone forever ,
you have to live forever .
she loved you .
she said ,
&quot; when it &apos;s real , you can &apos;t walk away . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a choice
you &apos;re not going to have to make .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t , please , don &apos;t hurt him--
i &apos;m doing you a favor .
lexi loved you .
and she was good . that means you &apos;re good too .
be better than him .
don &apos;t do this . i &apos;m begging you !
please .
thank you .
it wasn &apos;t for you .
well , now , look who &apos;s returned from battle
can i talk to your friend for minute ?
thank you .
i appreciate your help , stefan .
you &apos;re welcome ,
sheila .
i wasn &apos;t sure you remembered .
october 1969 .
i was barely a teenager .
and you were leading what was probably
the only anti @-@ war sit @-@ in within miles of mystic falls .
you know when you spoke ,
people were mesmerized .
i know i was .
until the cops showed up .
you took a big risk coming to see me earlier .
letting me read you , realizing who you were .
it could have gone a completely different way .
your family has a
very long history secret of keeping my secret
i knew that i could trust you if you believed
that i was worthy of your trust .
bonnie knows , doesn &apos;t she ?
yes
please understand our loyalty can only extend so far .
this town won &apos;t be easy on any of us if they figure it out .
and i &apos;ll protect my own before anybody else .
i know that .
as long as we &apos;re clear .
good night , then .
good night , sheila .
we were just leaving and i wanted to say goodbye .
good to see you again , damon .
no kiss ?
i &apos;m full of vervain .
i put it in everything i drink .
and you &apos;re telling me this , why ?
lexi was my friend .
how could you ?
the tomb can be opened .
you are lying !
emily &apos;s grimoire , her spellbook .
if you know how she closed the tomb .
the reversal process will be in her book .
you can open that tomb .
and where is this book ?
you have no idea .
no . i &apos;m telling you the truth .
and i believe you .
my dear sweet bree .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m almost sorry .
so why did you bring me with you ?
well , you &apos;re not the worst company in the world , elena .
you should give yourself more credit .
seriously ?
you were there in the road .
all damsel in distress @-@ like .
i knew it would piss off stefan .
and ...
and you are not the worst company in the world , elena .
i used to be more fun .
you did ok .
i saved your life .
i know .
and don &apos;t you forget it .
you could have told me .
i wanted to tell you .
you said no more lies .
only the truth .
i can handle the truth , stefan .
as crazy as it is .
i can handle the fact that you are a vampire .
and you have a vampire brother
and that my best friend is a witch .
i can accept the fact that
the world is a much more serious place
that i ever thought possible .
but this
this lie i can not take
what am i to you ?
who am i to you ?
you are not katherine .
you are the opposite of everything she was .
and when did you figure that out ?
before you kissed me ?
before we slept together ?
before i met you .
what ?
the first day of school .
when we met .
that wasn &apos;t the day for the first time , elena .
then when was it ?
may 23 , 2009 .
that was ...
that was the day your parents &apos; car
went off the bridge .
you were there ?
every couple of years that i come back here
to see zach and see my home .
last spring
i was out in the woods
by old wickery bridge .
and i heard the accident .
all of it .
i was fast getting there , but not fast enough .
the car was already submerged .
your dad ...
he was still conscious .
i was able to get to him ,
but he wouldn &apos;t let me help him until i helped you .
oh my god .
when i woke up in the hospital ,
nobody could figure out how i got out of the car .
they said it was a miracle .
i went back for them .
but it was too late . i couln &apos;t ...
i couldn &apos;t save them .
when i pulled you out ,
i looked at your face . you looked like katherine .
i couldn &apos;t believe the resemblance .
after that , i spent months
making sure that you weren &apos;t her .
i watched you . i learned everything that i could about you .
and i saw that you were nothing like katherine .
and i wanted to leave town .
but , elena , i couldn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t leave without knowing you .
i &apos;m so sorry that i didn &apos;t tell you . i wanted to .
but you were so sad .
why do i look like her ?
elena , you &apos;ve been through so much .
why do i look like her , stefan ?
what are you not telling me ?
it didn &apos;t make any sense me .
you were a gilbert . she was a pierce .
but the resemblance was too similar .
and then i learned the truth .
you were adopted , elena .
there you are .
ok , look . i know i don &apos;t know you ,
so don &apos;t ask me why i did this .
i just , sometimes ...
mostly all the time , i have this need to be right .
so i googled and ...
what is it ?
proof . sort of .
what does this mean ?
well , i only went as far back as 1942,
and found that there &apos;s been a string of animal attacks
periodically in and around this town for the past 75 years .
it &apos;s consistent .
in &apos; 62 , 5 bodies found .
in &apos; 53 , 4 people killed .
in &apos; 74 , 3 people dead .
and there &apos;s been 5 this year .
all attacked , all suffered major blood loss ,
as in drained of blood .
how do you know this ?
your birth certificate from the city records .
it says elena gilbert . mystic falls general .
but there &apos;s no record of your mother ever being admitted .
there &apos;s no record of her ever being pregnant .
what else do you know ?
for me to go any further ,
i would &apos;ve had to look into the pierce family ,
and i couldn do that .
it &apos;s too much of a risk ,
if someone found out i was asking about katherine .
listen to me , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you are the woman that i love .
i love you .
i don &apos;t set a lot of rules , elena .
not with you .
i trust you to tell me the truth .
where were you ? why would you lie to me about it ?
i thought that we were closer than that .
now is not the time you want to talk to me about lies .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t turn this back on me .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
ok , question ...
am i adopted ?
i trust you to tell me the truth too , jenna .
how could you not tell me ?
i thought we were closer than that .
elena , i didn &apos;t ...
they asked me not to .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i love you .
