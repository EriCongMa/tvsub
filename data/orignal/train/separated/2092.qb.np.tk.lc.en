thank you on behalf of our amazing samoan fire dancers
and our tahitian hula girls .
now it &apos;s finally time
to unearth the traditional kalua pig .
this scrumptious hawaiian delicacy
is seasoned and cooked for 12 hours
under layers of banana leaves and hot stones .
the result is a wonderful flavor
that can &apos;t be duplicated
except by this ancient hawaiian technique .
get your cameras ready !
on the count of three :
one ... two ... thr ...
okay , monkey , i want you to wipe that sad face off ;
you &apos;re gonna find her , i promise .
you have my word , okay ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m sorry i lost her .
what are you talking about ?
you didn &apos;t lose her .
let me explain something to you what happened .
dolphin trainer annie ,
she just got out of bed in the middle of the night
because she was thirsty .
she went to get a glass of water .
but the problem is , she couldn &apos;t find her way back to bed .
i &apos;m starting to think she does that
every time she &apos;s here , but that is fine
because good news for you and good news for her
is that i &apos;m a detective , a very good detective .
so , don &apos;t worry , we &apos;re in good hands .
that your mom ?
mm @-@ hmm .
well , would you tell her we got an emergency , okay ?
hold on .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
ma &apos;am ...
is this your missing person ?
yeah ? give me a smile .
okay , here you go .
come on . let &apos;s go .
excuse me . can i have my hug , please ?
come here . thank you .
hey , i want you to remember something , okay ? always .
danno loves you .
i love you , too .
give me a kiss .
can &apos;t be a dolphin trainer without the dolphin .
monkey !
hey . amy .
danny , i had to see you .
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s meka .
he &apos;s dead , danny .
so , yesterday , uh , i heard that it was a cop , but ...
ah , geez , i had no idea .
you couldn &apos;t have known .
they needed the dental records to identify his body .
where &apos;s billy ?
with his grandparents .
he &apos;s so confused , danny .
he knows his father is gone ,
but beyond that , i don &apos;t know what to tell him .
you know , amy , anything you need , i &apos;m here for you .
you know that .
meka always said you &apos;re the best partner he ever had .
yeah , for a haole anyway .
it wasn &apos;t like that .
he liked working with you
because you had fresh eyes , good instincts .
he said you were always direct with him .
he trusted you with his life .
what about the investigation ?
does hpd have any suspects ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t know .
um , hpd &apos;s kept their distance .
even the people i thought were meka &apos;s friends .
what do you mean ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
um ... they &apos;re not telling me anything .
wait , amy , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
none of this does .
when i called to ask about the funeral arrangements ,
they told me they &apos;re still pending .
they &apos;re pending ? they &apos;re pending what ?
i don &apos;t know .
every time i call to follow up , they give me the runaround .
it &apos;s like something &apos;s going on .
something they &apos;re not telling me .
my husband sacrificed his life for the job , and ...
the way he died ...
i just ... i need to know that there &apos;s someone out there
looking for the people who did that to him .
okay , listen ... there is now .
official c.o.d is two shots to the chest .
close contact .
everything else was postmortem .
all right , close contact .
might have been someone he knew .
what about the slugs ?
.45s.
ballistics has them . no hits yet .
i checked with the luau organizers .
the imu pit was dug and prepped the night before ,
and the m.e. &apos; s guess was ,
the body was put there between 4 : 00 and 5 : 00 am .
so no witnesses .
somebody actually had to dig up a pig
and replace it with meka &apos;s body .
nobody &apos;s saw anything ?
i find that very hard to believe .
i &apos;ll tell you , killing a cop like that ,
putting his badge in his mouth ?
that &apos;s no average street crime .
that &apos;s someone sending a message .
yeah ? all right , well , i want to know who sent it .
it could be related to something meka was working on .
all right , chin , you and kono go to meka &apos;s house ,
talk to his wife .
her name &apos;s amy .
uh , her son &apos;s name is billy .
good . okay . see if meka left any of his casework at the house .
danny and i will go follow up with hpd .
all right , who &apos;s the lead detective on the case ?
a sergeant name of cage .
cage ?
you sure ?
why ? you know him ?
yeah . but cage isn &apos;t homicide .
he &apos;s a headhunter .
internal affairs .
cage , you are a prince .
a cop gets murdered and burned in a pit ,
and you are out here practicing your swing .
how i choose to spend my lunch hour is my business .
some people relieve stress by lifting weights , others run .
i hit tiny little white balls a very long way .
why is internal affairs running a homicide investigation ?
more importantly , where do you get the stones big enough
to mess with a fallen officer &apos;s memorial service ?
can you tell me that ?
look , detective williams ,
i understand where you &apos;re coming from .
you knew the victim .
rest assured , we &apos;re investigating
detective hanamoa &apos;s murder to the best of our ability .
good , good . so you got witnesses ,
suspects , leads ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
look , sergeant , the governor &apos;s given us full authority and jurisdiction .
okay ? so whatever you do have ...
i know all about you five @-@ o task force ,
and that you forced yourself onto this case .
but this is an internal affairs matter
involving an officer suspected of corruption .
we will hand this in @-@ house .
what did you say , corruption ?
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you , corruption , huh ?
danny , danny .
you got evidence to back that up ?
off the record ?
yeah . sure . off the record .
last few months ,
an alarming number of detective hanamoa &apos;s cases
seemed to fall apart at the eleventh hour .
i &apos;m talking raids getting blown ,
leads drying up , busts coming up empty .
stop .
stop .
i knew this guy . all right ?
he was a good cop .
he was a clean cop .
believe what you want .
i said too much already .
all right , we want to see the case files .
they &apos;re sealed by court order .
okay , all right , then give us a name .
all right , a number .
i &apos;ll settle for a haiku .
just point us in a direction .
good day , gentlemen .
okay , you know what ?
this is why everybody hates internal affairs ,
because you are useless .
not even worth it .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to some real cops .
detective williams , i &apos;m warning you .
let us handle this .
you know what ?
meka was his friend .
then he should recuse himself .
when you know the victim , it clouds your judgment .
spare your friend some pain .
the more he learns , the worse he &apos;s gonna feel .
trust me .
i &apos;m so grateful danny sent help .
what kind of things are you looking for ?
his cell phone or a laptop ...
anything that your husband might have used for work .
he had his cell phone on him .
that &apos;s okay . we can run his records without it .
what about a computer ?
meka &apos;s laptop &apos;s in the den .
he was on it all the time for work .
do you mind ?
no , no . go ahead , please .
i know this is hard , but did meka have any enemies ?
get any threats of any kind ?
not that i know of .
uh , he &apos;d been pretty quiet the last month .
like he gets when he locks onto a case .
but now knowing about this i.a. thing ,
i guess he was probably stressed ,
he didn &apos;t want to tell us .
just because i.a. accused meka of something
doesn &apos;t make it true .
have you dealt with them before ?
unfortunately , yeah .
is this meka &apos;s desk ?
yeah .
hey , ahuna ,
what happened to all of meka &apos;s stuff ?
i.a. cleared it out yesterday .
cage is a vulture .
you know what meka was working on ?
no clue .
sorry , gotta go .
&quot; sorry , gotta go . &quot;
how about you , you know what meka was working on ?
nope .
you ?
know what meka was working on ?
nobody ?
what was meka working on ?
12 years the guy wears a badge ,
and you &apos;re all looking at me like you don &apos;t know who he is ?
i need somebody to help me out here .
kaleo , right ?
yeah .
you work with meka before ?
i &apos;m in the middle of something here .
yeah , i know , you &apos;re in the middle
of not answering my question .
you got issues , haole , take it up with i.a. ,
&apos;cause we got a gag order here ,
and around here , we follow orders .
understand ?
yeah . i understand .
chin , what do you got ?
just ran meka &apos;s cell phone records .
found something odd .
on the night before he died , he booked a flight out .
where to ?
singapore . he was flying there next week .
all right , uh ... talk to amy ,
see if maybe they were going on a family vacation .
i already did . he only bought one ticket .
amy had no idea .
all right , see if you can recover his e @-@ mails , all right .
see who he was going to see there ,
where he was staying , anything . please .
got it .
what ? what do you think ?
i &apos;m ...
guy books a flight out of the country
the night before he &apos;s murdered .
it just @-@ it just makes me wonder .
makes you wonder what ?
that he knew it was coming .
okay , can you please just do me a favor ?
don &apos;t go there .
come on , danny ,
just level with me here . you didn &apos;t think of that for a second ?
no , i didn &apos;t think of that for a second , all right ?
you want something to think about ,
think about kaleo , getting some answers from him ,
&apos;cause all these questions are giving me a migraine .
take it easy .
okay . i &apos;m easy .
singapore ?
no , never heard meka mention it . why ?
because we thought it might have something
to do with an active case .
honestly , i don &apos;t know anything about it .
i just know that no one deserves to go out like that .
you hear why internal affairs is after him ?
people talk . who knows ?
some guys like ahuna think he was on the take .
others say he got too close , and it got him killed .
too close to what ?
you ever hear of the ochoa cartel ?
yeah , the new up @-@ and @-@ comers in the coke trade .
they turned the texas border into a war zone .
why ? what , you think ochoa &apos;s people are here ?
all i know for sure , when ochoas move in on new territory ,
they don &apos;t just hit people .
they like to send a message .
like roasting a pig at a luau ?
tell you what , if this ochoa thing is for real ,
it makes complete sense why cage
is putting this whole thing on lockdown .
i mean , a high @-@ profile case like this
could boost his career ...
what ? what &apos;s with the face ?
i don &apos;t have a face .
yes , you do . you have a face , okay ?
i am a detective , it &apos;s what i do ,
i read people , all right .
and you , my friend , have a face .
all right . i want to ask you something ,
but i know it &apos;s going to piss you off .
would you not always be so judgmental with me ?
i &apos;m not judgmental .
treat me like i &apos;m some hothead who can &apos;t think objectively .
i can think objectively .
really ?
yes , really ! ask away !
okay .
did you and meka ever have any issues ?
any issues ... ?
no , no issues , oprah .
it &apos;s just , cage said something that &apos;s really ...
it &apos;s been bugging me .
something about a leak in the department .
okay . he never said that , first of all .
second of all , cage couldn &apos;t find a leak
if someone was taking one on his head !
okay maybe , whatever .
but remember sang min ,
the human trafficker than we took down ?
no , it doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
yeah , i remember him .
almost got kono killed when she went undercover .
thank you . okay .
sang min took a photo of kono .
he sent it to somebody in hpd
who i.d. &apos; d her as a cop .
okay , so what are you implying ?
i &apos;m not implying anything .
i &apos;m asking for your objective opinion as a detective ,
is it possible that person could &apos;ve been meka ?
no .
it &apos;s not possible ?
not possible .
i just said ... zero chance .
what are you doing ? what , are you taking cage &apos;s side ?
i &apos;m not taking cage &apos;s side , danny ,
i &apos;m just saying ,
maybe it &apos;s worth a trip to halawa correctional
to get sang min to tell us
who his inside man was .
sang min should &apos;ve told us
what a hoffa was !
we grilled the guy for 72 hours !
we offered him plea bargains !
now he &apos;s doing life ,
he &apos;s gonna answer the same question ?
what are we gonna do , say &quot; pretty please &quot; ?
well , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth a trip to find out ?
our job is to go after the suspect ,
not the victim !
not the previously convicted ,
the suspect , ochoa !
he deals drugs , and he &apos;s dangerous !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna focus on , okay ?
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re not a hothead .
i would hate to work with someone like that .
your detective friend kaleo wasn &apos;t kidding--
the ochoa cartel doesn &apos;t fool around .
this is a car bomb that exploded
on the steps of a courthouse in juarez .
this is a cop
burned in a roll of rubber tires in oaxaca .
and these federales were the first to be found
with their badges in their mouths .
just like meka .
kono , did you get anything off meka &apos;s laptop from the house ?
no , the hard drive was wiped clean .
but i &apos;m running a sweep on it for deleted files .
according to the dea ,
one of the family &apos;s top lieutenants ,
a guy by the name of emilio ochoa ,
is the one responsible for the hits .
so if he &apos;s here ...
i want him .
the question is , how do we get to him .
through his product--
we find ochoa &apos;s distributor on this island ,
that &apos;s how we get to him .
if we &apos;re looking for a new player on the coke market--
you know who we got to see .
howzit , chin !
good to see you .
and my two favorite overdressed white boys .
howzit , bruthas ?
oh , brah , this cart is da kine !
it &apos;s the future kine .
this is what the tycoon &apos;s refer to as ...
a franchise !
no more brick , no more mortar--that &apos;s old school .
well , we were wondering if you had a line
on a different kind of distribution franchise coming into o &apos;ahu .
yeah . uh , we &apos;re not talking about shave ice
more like snow .
okay , let me guess ,
uh , let &apos;s have three snow cones
and a couple oversized t @-@ shirts .
how about that ? help you with your franchise .
it &apos;s not about the funds , brah .
this is dangerous territory we &apos;re treading into .
a brutha could get hurt , you know ?
somebody already did get hurt ,
and he was a friend of mine , you understand ?
hey , how about a little kokua , brah ?
we could sure use the name of the new connect in town .
you guys like modern art ?
so , this is the the apocalypse of eden
through the eyes of a misanthropic diet--
deity or diety ?
whatever .
it &apos;s appropriately named .
you know , grace used to do stuff like this
when she was in kindergarten .
maybe she &apos;s got a future in art .
yeah , i was hoping she &apos;d move past finger painting
on to bigger and better things .
$ 25,000 for this ?
no way .
this is a clifton bowles original .
what , you don &apos;t believe me ?
bing it .
i will .
who knew you were such an art connoisseur ?
remember , cuz , the best front operation
is one that actually does legit business .
i think i just spotted our gatekeeper .
now we just got to get her to show us the guy behind the curtain .
looks like we need a magic card .
check it out .
all right .
whoa ! hey , man , watch where you &apos;re going .
i almost spilled my drink .
sorry , buddy , you all right ?
sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
nice time .
good evening , gentlemen .
good evening .
like what you see ?
uh , yeah , it &apos;s hard not to .
yeah , this one &apos;s very conceptual .
are you interested in this piece ?
actually , my friend and i are in the high @-@ volume resale business .
do you know where your toes are ?
good ! look what she &apos;s doing .
yeah , toes . that &apos;s your knee .
yeah ! oh , sorry .
okay , work it .
come on ! yes !
please wait a moment .
sure . thanks .
wait , you give it , give it . bend down .
so , uh , just a question .
if things go bad , which one of these guys you want ?
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll take the ugly one .
oh , that &apos;s good ... they &apos;re both ugly .
all right , good .
okay , get out . get out , get out ,
get out , get out . out , out , out .
hey , gentlemen . shall we have a little chat ?
yes . we , uh , we &apos;d love that .
but maybe in private would be better .
get out ! get out of here !
buh @-@ bye . okay , so now we &apos;re having fun .
we &apos;re just having a good old time ,
and i don &apos;t know who you are ,
because i &apos;ve never seen you before in my life .
oh , we , uh , we just ...
we just came in from out of town .
okay .
and would this be the first piece
you are purchasing from us ?
uh , yeah , here .
uh , and by &quot; piece , &quot; uh , you mean a key , right ?
i mean , for those of us not into art .
i don &apos;t have any idea what you &apos;re talking about , um , at all .
but in case you want to buy a piece ,
it &apos;s very simple ... here &apos;s how it works .
uh , 75 % down and 25 % upon delivery .
no problem at all .
but uh , we would prefer to pay ochoa directly .
he &apos;s in town , right ?
you guys need to get out of here right now .
right now .
whoa , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry . did we say something wrong ?
uh , no . i just don &apos;t like you .
oh , fantastic .
freeze ! five @-@ o !
hands up .
put the gun down , get on your knees , now .
we good ?
yeah , looks well .
see that ?
where is ochoa ?
i &apos;m not saying a word .
not one single word .
if you wanted to do it the hard way ,
you should &apos;ve just said so .
just for the record , if i pulled something like this ,
you would be reading me the riot act
about roper police procedure .
no . i &apos;d probably just arrest you .
compared to this , hanging a guy
off the roof and throwing a guy
in a shark cage seems pretty tame .
you know what ? i disagree .
the shark cage was way worse than this .
whatever . you &apos;re wrong . i &apos;m just saying , to be clear ,
the next time , i get free pass , okay ?
help !
help ! ah !
how you feeling ?
did the ride kick @-@ start your memory at all ?
you &apos;re insane .
where &apos;s ochoa ?
i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t !
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s fine .
danny , let &apos;s take him around again .
no , no .
you know what we should do ?
let &apos;s loosen these a little bit .
he &apos;ll slide a little bit more , maybe ...
that &apos;s a good idea . got a full tank of gas .
we can do this all night .
no , no !
there &apos;s a shipment coming in tomorrow .
ochoa is meeting me at waialua
at the old coffee plantation .
okay , how is ochoa smuggling cocaine onshore
without getting busted ?
he has a man inside ... hpd .
tells him every single move the cops make .
who is it ?
i have no idea . i do not know .
he &apos;s the only one that knows .
ochoa is the only one that knows . i swear .
you sure about that ?
absolutely sure . i swear .
you guys get bastille to talk ?
uh , yeah . danny gave him a little nudge .
all right , according to our middleman ,
ochoa &apos;s bringing in a big shipment tomorrow night .
and we &apos;re gonna be there when it happens .
meka &apos;s computer ... anything about who
he was gonna see in singapore ?
no , but in
his deleted internet history
there &apos;s a cloud site that he visited frequently .
all right , tell me you tapped into the off @-@ site server .
oh , yeah .
wire transfers , six @-@ figure transactions
from an ochoa shell corporation in mexico
to an encrypted account in singapore .
well , that explains why he was gonna go there next week .
why ? i don &apos;t get it .
well , singapore &apos;s like the new switzerland .
it &apos;s one of the few places post @-@ 9 / 11
that didn &apos;t change its banking confidentiality laws .
so they can actually hide the account holder &apos;s i.d.
even from the authorities .
okay , so meka was on a money trail , right ?
he &apos;s going down there , lean on the bank ,
try to find out who the account holder is .
yeah , or meka was the account holder ,
and he was looking to run .
yeah , or that .
look , i know you like to remind me that i &apos;m not a cop .
&apos;cause you &apos;re not .
yeah , whatever .
but i know enough to realize that where there &apos;s smoke ...
wh ... where there &apos;s smoke ?
should we write that on the wall ?
&quot; where there &apos;s smoke &quot; ?
&quot; your honor , he &apos;s guilty .
why ? there was smoke . &quot;
busts gone bad , wire transfers ,
hidden accounts ,
a ticket to singapore his wife didn &apos;t know anything about .
i mean , danny , i &apos;m just saying .
meka &apos;s taking money from ochoa ,
and then he just decides to leave the country ? why ?
maybe because i.a. was closing in on him .
and maybe ochoa couldn &apos;t afford meka getting caught
and talking , so he had him killed .
and this is based on what , an i.a. witch hunt ?
you know what ? i &apos;m done .
how about that , all right ?
if my word is not good enough for you ,
then i do not know what i &apos;m doing here .
hey , jj , set me up .
and one more for my buddy here .
good timing .
his old man was the same way , you know .
mcgarrett &apos;s .
they got this laser focus embedded in their dna .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s good sometimes to remind them
that their way isn &apos;t the only one that works .
yeah ? right now somewhere steve just twitched .
he &apos;ll come around .
thank you .
thank you .
by the way ,
i really admire what you &apos;re doing for meka .
same thing anybody would do .
i wish that were true , bro .
would &apos;ve saved me a lot of grief .
truth is , when a bully like cage is on the attack ,
most guys back down .
they get so quiet ,
you &apos;d think their mouths were glued shut .
yeah , well , it makes me sick no one stuck up for you .
well , cage comes hard , bro .
he was convinced i was on the take ,
so he convinced everyone else of it , too .
the lengths he went to , to try and expose me .
you know he tapped my phones ?
he went through my garbage .
he talked to my lieutenants , my old partner .
he kept digging and digging
until he could find any weakness ,
anything he could exploit .
eventually , he put a cloud of guilt so thick over my head ,
he turned my desk into a ghost town .
loneliest place on earth is where no one believes you .
hey , i got your back now , buddy , all right ?
and i &apos;m in your corner a thousand percent .
so you tell me what you need .
i need to clear meka &apos;s name .
so i think i gotta listen to mcgarrett .
i got to go see somebody .
you , uh , you look horrible ,
sang min .
i &apos;ve been in solitary for 30 days .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
oh , must be all the sunshine i &apos;m getting on the outside .
so just you ?
where &apos;s that little hottie surfer girl who set me up ?
she &apos;s busy .
uh , but she ask me to punch you in the mouth for her .
oh , still spicy , huh ?
yeah . you done ?
relax .
i can &apos;t touch her for at least another 20 years .
um , i need a name , sang min .
how &apos;s your family , detective ?
you have a daughter , right ?
you see her enough ?
listen , i will come back for a social visit next week ,
but right now , i need that name .
i didn &apos;t talk before . what makes you think i &apos;m gonna start now ?
all right . don &apos;t say anything .
hey . don &apos;t say anything .
look at this picture . just nod .
nod yes or no . is this him ?
i &apos;m done here .
hold on . hold on . listen to me .
pick up the phone .
pick up the phone .
pick up the phone .
was meka hanamoa the one feeding you inside information ?
was he your mole on the inside ?
was he your mole in the police department ?
why so important to you ?
because he was a friend of mine .
all right ?
and this is what happened to him .
he &apos;s got a wife
and a young son .
and now they are on their own .
that &apos;s gotta hit home for you .
hpd is gonna cut his family off
from all the benefits he earned .
all right ? they &apos;re gonna put them on the street .
all because of what they think that he did .
so i &apos;m asking you .
was it him ?
look at the photo .
if you want me to risk my safety , detective ,
then i set the terms of our deal
before i tell you anything .
what do you want ?
thanks .
sang min ?
he give you anything ?
what are you doing here ?
i came to ask you a question .
you did ? well , if it &apos;s to the prom ,
i already have a date , but i &apos;m flattered .
thank you .
that &apos;s funny .
look , man , i know you &apos;re pissed . all right ?
i &apos;m just trying to figure out
if it &apos;s because they told you meka was dirty ,
or if it &apos;s because you found out he actually was dirty ,
and you didn &apos;t know about it .
okay . listen to me . this is not an ego thing .
okay ? this is about meka .
he would not move off to singapore
and leave his wife and his kid . you understand ?
i know that because he was my friend .
he was my partner .
right . but what is it you cops always say ?
don &apos;t ignore the evidence .
okay . all right , but let me ask you a question .
let &apos;s say i.a. accused me of skimming off a drug lord ,
and they showed you a stack of evidence
that suggested i did it .
would you believe them ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
why not ?
exactly .
okay .
yeah ? okay what ?
okay , we can move on , okay .
we got a location on ochoa ?
good . we got a takedown to plan .
we appreciate you wanting to help , detective kaleo .
name of the game is stealth .
okay ? ochoa . he has a meeting on the books
with his middleman bastille right here
it &apos;s an old coffee plantation .
we &apos;re gonna make sure the meeting happens as planned .
except , i take it ,
bastille will have a couple new bodyguards escorting him ?
exactly .
but nobody makes a move until we see the coke
and the deal is in play .
we do this by the book , or the charges don &apos;t stick .
yeah . no cowboy crap , all right ?
we need him alive , able to speak .
what about swat or air support ?
no . ochoa senses any backup , he &apos;ll be in the wind .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
oh , hey , sergeant . it &apos;s called police work .
i got a book , explain the whole thing to you .
word in narcotics is you &apos;re going after ochoa . that true ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
listen to me , detective .
i &apos;ve been working with the dea
on a rico case for months now ,
so if you &apos;re going after ochoa , i &apos;m coming with you .
hey . in my office , you listen to me , sergeant .
dea ... what are you talking about ?
they approached hpd about a number of blown narco cases ,
cases specifically involving
your friend meka and emilio ochoa .
then , for some reason , meka got himself killed .
we think it &apos;s because he got greedy .
you think it &apos;s because he was gonna take down ochoa .
i want to know which one of us is right . don &apos;t you ?
well , i was just starting to get used to my cell .
by the way , just so we &apos;re all aware , ochoa &apos;s going to kill us .
shut up , you . okay ?
or you &apos;re surfing the hood again ,
this time with no cords .
be preferable to your current plan &apos; cause at least
i have some chance of surviving it .
just be cool , okay ?
you &apos;re picking up another shipment .
it &apos;s nothing out of the ordinary .
you got it ?
all right , listen , van gogh .
all you got to do is get ochoa to show us the goods ,
and then we will take care of the rest .
you understand ?
what ... what are you smirking at ?
huh ? nothing . i just ... the no tie thing ... i like it .
you &apos;re starting to look like you actually fit in .
yeah , well , don &apos;t get used to it , okay ?
if we want him to talk , we need him alive .
yeah , i know .
don &apos;t quote me to me .
emilio , you &apos;re looking sharp as usual .
what is ... what is that , armani ?
or zegna . which ... which is ...
well , whatever it is , though ,
it really looks great .
you got what we agreed on ?
yeah . yeah .
of course .
okay , then . let &apos;s get on with it .
throw the bag over .
why are you sweating ?
you nervous ?
no . i ... it &apos;s 110 degrees out here ,
and i &apos;ve got thin blood .
and i , uh ...
didn &apos;t put deodorant on today .
the heat &apos;s just killing me , man .
yeah , of course .
but business is good ?
oh , yeah . yeah . it &apos;s booming .
booming ?
that &apos;s excellent .
yeah .
i see you have new men .
oh , yeah .
their names ?
christopher
and wallace .
you know , i didn &apos;t expect to be meeting new people .
i ... i won &apos;t do that again , i guess .
anyway , it &apos;s great to see you ,
and , uh , so ...
if we &apos;re ... if we &apos;re done here ...
i don &apos;t like new people .
you know that .
i can &apos;t do this .
freeze ! hpd !
there goes ochoa !
i got him !
what happened ?
we needed him alive . what happened ?
he drew on me . i had no choice .
i &apos;m sorry , danny .
yeah , there &apos;s not going to be a ... a trial .
they said they &apos;d pay for the basic cost of the funeral ,
but they won &apos;t do the whole ceremony .
i know . i know . me , neither .
all right , listen .
um , i ... i &apos;ll come by in a ... in a couple hours , okay ?
amy ?
yep .
i &apos;m not done with this . i &apos;m not .
i know you &apos;re not .
neither are we , man .
we got you .
coroner report &apos;s back .
ballistics confirm that the .45 on ochoa
was the same gun used to killed meka .
and there &apos;s something else .
check out the circular marks around the bullet holes .
muzzle burns .
according to the m.e. ,
kaleo had to be in pretty close range
to leave marks like that .
that &apos;s not self @-@ defense .
looks more like an execution to me .
so why didn &apos;t ochoa shoot
if kaleo was that close to him ?
maybe ochoa didn &apos;t feel like kaleo
was a threat , because he knew him .
hold on . hold on .
or it wasn &apos;t ochoa &apos;s .45 .
kaleo ...
kaleo planted that gun on ochoa after he killed him .
oh , that was mean .
i don &apos;t know how the hell it happened .
ochoa had me dead to rights .
i was just lucky to get the first shot off .
lucky ?
you know ...
it takes a lot more than luck
to do what you did .
to pull off what you pulled off .
i mean , i &apos;m actually impressed .
what are you talking about ?
let me ask you a question , because ...
i &apos;m just curious ... with ochoa dead
and this case closed , does it bother you at all
that i.a. still thinks meka &apos;s the mole ?
i mean , i don &apos;t want to believe it , but if they got
evidence to prove ...
evidence .
funny thing about that .
what &apos;s this ?
they &apos;re records of wire transfers
from ochoa to an account in singapore .
you see , meka was on his way to meet thorities there
to get them to release the identity of the account holder .
so ? what &apos;s that got to do with me ?
everything , considering the account was yours .
get the hell out of my face , haole .
case is over . we got the guy .
you have been selling out this department for months ...
selling out these guys ...
to anybody willing to pay the price .
all right ?
and meka found out about it .
my friend found out about it , so you shot him .
you shot him , and you threw him in a fire pit .
then you killed ochoa ,
and you planted the gun on him
so it &apos;d look like he killed meka .
and what you did ... look at me ...
what you did was impressive
because you thought you cleaned everything up ,
but you made one mistake , because you &apos;re stupid .
that &apos;s him .
you killed my friend .
sit down .
danny .
i can give you a minute to talk to them if you want .
no .
i &apos;ve caused my wife and son enough pain .
but thank you .
for keeping your word .
i found that last night .
the ceremony today ,
all those people showing up ...
it was lovely .
it meant everything .
meka deserved it .
thank you .
