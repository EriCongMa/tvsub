oh , i always tear up
when the grinch &apos;s heart grows three sizes .
tears seem appropriate .
enlargement of the heart muscle ,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , is a serious disease
which could lead to congestive heart failure .
you really didn &apos;t like it , sheldon ?
no , on the contrary .
i found the grinch to be a relatable , engaging character .
and i was really with him right up to the point
that he succumbed to social convention
and returned the presents and saved christmas .
what a buzz kill that was .
when we watch frosty the snowman , he roots for the sun .
excuse me ,
but the sun is essential for all life on earth .
frosty is merely
a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat .
a crime , by the way , for which he is never brought to account .
i just love decorating the christmas tree .
it makes me feel like a little girl again .
we didn &apos;t have a tree when i was growing up .
really ? why not ?
mmm , in my family ,
holidays weren &apos;t so much celebrated as studied
for their anthropological and psychological implications
on human society .
oh , sounds festive .
did you at least give presents ?
mmm , in a way .
we presented papers .
and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other .
sheldon , what about you ?
did you have a christmas tree ?
oh , yes .
we had a tree , we had a manger ,
we had an inflatable santa claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn .
and to make things even more jolly ,
there were so many blinking lights on the house
they induced neighborhood @-@ wide seizures .
so i take it you don &apos;t want to help us trim the tree .
i do not .
but if you insist
on decorating a spider @-@ infested fire hazard in my home
i would request that you add this .
what is it ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
it &apos;s a bust of sir isaac newton .
oh , sure , sure .
very christmasy .
wait , excuse me , but it &apos;s much
more &quot; christmasy &quot; than anything you &apos;ve put on the tree .
here we go .
december 25 , 1642 , julian calendar ,
sir isaac newton is born .
jesus , on the other hand , was actually born in the summer
his birthday was moved
to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday
that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats .
which , frankly ,
sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother
followed by a fruitcake .
merry newton @-@ mas , everyone .
i sense that &apos;s not sincere , although i have no idea why .
no , it &apos;s fine . look , sir issac can go
right next to this little candy cane .
no . isaac goes at the top of the tree .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
i understand .
you dispute newton &apos;s claim that he invented calculus
and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top .
yeah , you got me .
i &apos;m a leibniz man .
well , perhaps when your mother gets here ,
she &apos;ll talk some sense into you .
what ?
your @-@ your mother &apos;s coming ? when ?
tomorrow .
when were you going to tell me ?
um ... tomorrow ?
why were you keeping this a secret ?
well , i just-- i thought ...
if i can interject here ,
obviously leonard is concerned
that his mother won &apos;t approve of you as his mate .
why wouldn &apos;t she approve of me ?
i &apos;m adorable .
you are , it &apos;s just ...
if i can interject again .
leonard comes from a remarkably high @-@ achieving family ,
who have all chosen high @-@ achieving partners .
he probably feels
that it &apos;s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed
with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement
is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu .
hey , it &apos;s a big menu .
there &apos;s two pages just for desserts .
i know .
and those specials-- they change every day .
okay , you know what ? it &apos;s lame when i say it .
it &apos;s just ridiculous when you pile on .
okay .
sorry .
so what did she say when you told her we were going out ?
um ...
you didn &apos;t tell her we were going out , did you ?
um ...
why not ?
um ...
leonard ...
i &apos;m no expert on meditation ,
but if you &apos;re trying to calm yourself down ,
i believe the word is &quot; om . &quot;
it was so nice of you
to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up .
no trouble at all .
i drove , mother .
i &apos;m driving now .
yes , dear . mommy &apos;s proud .
i &apos;ve been meaning to thank you
for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum brain dynamic theory .
my pleasure .
for a non @-@ physicist ,
you have a remarkable grasp
of how electric dipoles in the brain &apos;s water molecules
could not possibly form a bose condensate .
wait , wait , wait .
when did you send my mom notes on a paper ?
august 16 .
right after her carpal tunnel surgery .
oh , did i thank you for the flowers ?
you did .
i don &apos;t really like flowers .
neither do i , but it &apos;s the social convention .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
wait , wait , wait . you had surgery ?
yes , and sheldon sent me flowers .
no , i heard that .
then what was all that &quot; wait , wait , wait &quot; about ?
i just don &apos;t understand
why he knows more about your life than i do .
well , i would assume it &apos;s because sheldon
and i stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect ,
while you avoid me ,
due to unresolved childhood issues .
it &apos;s what we think
caused your narcissistic personality disorder .
we discussed it at length during our last video chat .
although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling .
yes , but we are on the subject ,
so i &apos;m obliged to ask .
leonard , how are you ?
fine , mom . how are you ?
mmm , menopausal .
now i &apos;m less fine .
have you heard your brother has gotten engaged ?
no .
sheldon , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
my bad .
i did send a gift from both of us .
she &apos;s a remarkable girl .
the youngest appeals court judge in new jersey
and a two @-@ time olympic bronze medalist .
you must be very happy .
why ? i &apos;m not marrying her .
so , how about you ?
are you seeing anyone interesting ?
well , i &apos;m not sure about interesting , but ...
not the time , sheldon .
very well .
shall we switch topics
to isaac newton v. gottfried leibniz ?
it &apos;s all right , sheldon .
i will just pretend
that leonard &apos;s not withholding information .
although , i will point out , leonard ,
that i am a trained psychiatrist
and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics
that accompanied your learning to masturbate .
isn &apos;t she brilliant , leonard ?
how i envy you .
so , howard ,
have you and rajesh finally summoned the courage
to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another ?
what ? no .
why not ?
because we don &apos;t have latent homosexual feelings
toward one another .
i see .
no , really .
i have a girlfriend now .
and where is she this evening ?
she had to go out of town .
her grandmother died .
i see .
her grandmother died .
honest to god .
leonard , tell her i have a girlfriend .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about ?
tell her i have a girlfriend !
all right .
he &quot; has &quot; a &quot; girlfriend . &quot;
her name is bernadette . she &apos;s working as a waitress ,
but she &apos;s going to school to be a microbiologist .
howard , keep in mind that the more passionately
you stick to this construct ,
the more you &apos;re hurting your partner .
do you really think your lips in my ear is helping ?
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
oh , glad you &apos;re here . uh , sit down .
i &apos;ll get you a plate .
mom , you remember penny .
oh , yes , the waitress slash actress
with the unresolved father issues .
has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts ?
well , he sent me a football and a catcher &apos;s mitt for christmas ,
so i &apos;m going to say no .
if it helps , we &apos;re all good with your breasts .
classic overcompensation .
oh , speaking of fathers , leonard ,
that reminds me , i &apos;m divorcing your father .
what ? !
yes . he was cheating on me .
no !
yes , with some waitress
from the university cafeteria .
can you believe it ?
a waitress ?
oh , no offense , dear .
no , it sounded like a compliment .
when did this happen ?
mmm , well , let &apos;s see .
sheldon , when did i leave leonard &apos;s father ?
september 22 .
oh , yes , that &apos;s right .
the weekend after leonard &apos;s dog died .
mitzy &apos;s dead ? !
she was old and blind , leonard .
what choice did we have ?
i don &apos;t believe this .
why am i the last to know ? !
excuse me , leonard , i am the one who &apos;s getting a divorce ,
mitzy is the one who is dead .
why are you the one making a fuss ?
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m way out of line !
so , penny , what &apos;s new in your life ?
nothing .
not a damn thing .
thank you for driving me back to my hotel .
oh , it &apos;s not a problem .
i was going to ask leonard to do it ,
but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable
and you don &apos;t want someone like that operating heavy machinery .
no , you do not .
your &quot; check engine &quot; light is on .
yeah , i gotta put a sticker over that .
so , uh , you must be devastated about your divorce .
oh , not at all .
but i am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle
that &apos;s not subjected to regular maintenance .
come on , i mean , you &apos;re not upset
that your marriage is over ?
well , initially i felt something akin to grief
and perhaps anger ,
but that &apos;s the natural reaction of the limbic system
to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch .
sure , sure .
thankfully , my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact
that i haven &apos;t had intercourse with him in eight years .
eight years ?
oh , that &apos;s nothing .
i &apos;ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982 .
yikes .
what &apos;s so funny ?
that &apos;s exactly what i say during orgasms : &quot; yikes . &quot;
you know what ? i could use a drink .
do you want to stop for a drink ?
oh , i don &apos;t drink .
i do , i &apos;ll teach you .
leonard ?
leonard ?
leonard ... ?
what is it ?
i made tea .
i don &apos;t want tea .
i didn &apos;t make tea for you .
this is my tea .
then why are you telling me ?
it &apos;s a conversation starter .
that &apos;s a lousy conversation starter .
oh , is it ? we &apos;re conversing .
checkmate .
what do you want , sheldon ?
what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise
in a one @-@ man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule
known as sheldon alpha five .
i want that too .
why are you here ?
to comfort you , of course .
no , that &apos;s not going to work at all .
i &apos;ll comfort you from over here .
leonard , what you &apos;re experiencing
is a classic jungian crisis
in which the aging individual mourns the loss
of the never @-@ to @-@ be realized ideal family unit .
thank you , that &apos;s very comforting .
that &apos;s not the comforting part .
it &apos;s not ?
no , no .
the comforting part is that the germans
have a term for what you &apos;re feeling .
weltschmerz .
it means
the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is
to a hypothetical , idealized world .
you &apos;re right , i do feel better .
well , the germans have always been a comforting people .
just remember , leonard , where your biological family
has failed you , you always have me , your surrogate family .
you &apos;re my surrogate family ?
if it &apos;s any consolation , i &apos;m not happy about it either .
good night .
okay , now this time try drinking it all at once .
yikes .
i &apos;ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003 .
another round for me and my homegirl .
i feel a spreading warmth through my extremities .
as long as you don &apos;t feel it
running down your pants , you &apos;re fine .
oh , that is fascinating .
i &apos;m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions .
for example ,
i &apos;m seriously considering asking that busboy
to ravish me in the alleyway while i eat cheesecake .
what do you think ?
well , we are known for our cheesecake .
hit us again .
yes .
if a little is good , more must be better .
hey , bev , guess what ?
what ?
i &apos;m sleeping with your son .
really ? which one ?
the one from whom i live across the hall ... from .
well , that &apos;s convenient .
how did his penis turn out ?
oh , beverly , i can &apos;t talk to my boyfriend &apos;s mother
about his penis .
oh , fair enough .
what can you tell me , if anything ,
about that busboy &apos;s penis ?
actually , i &apos;ve only had the cheesecake .
one more time .
you know , leonard did not want to tell you we were dating .
really ?
well , that means he &apos;s either
embarrassed about the relationship
or he doesn &apos;t care enough about his mother
to tell her he &apos;s in one .
either way , one of us should be insulted .
well , let &apos;s go find out who .
you go get a taxi .
i &apos;m gonna slip my business card
into that busboy &apos;s back pocket ,
cupping his firm , right buttock as i do so .
leonard ... ?
sonny boy !
get out here !
your mommy wants to talk to you !
what the hell is going on ?
you &apos;re in trouble .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl ?
did i say that right ?
yeah , not bad , not bad .
are you guys drunk ?
well , i hope so .
otherwise , why would we have stopped at del taco ?
now , how could you not tell me
you were in a relationship
with this lovely , charming young woman ?
oh , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
is it because she &apos;s uneducated ,
trapped in a menial service position ?
what the hell happened to &quot; lovely and charming &quot; ?
how come you didn &apos;t tell me
that you and father were getting a divorce ?
how come you didn &apos;t tell me you had surgery ?
how come you didn &apos;t tell me my dog died ?
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ...
what i hear you saying
is that you want a more intimate mother @-@ son relationship .
i do .
there . it &apos;s late .
now , go to bed .
i &apos;m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart .
that &apos;s the del taco .
why is leonard softly banging his head
against his bedroom door ?
speaking of warm feelings-- come here .
now i &apos;d rather have the busboy .
thank you for taking me to the airport .
you &apos;re very welcome .
once again , i &apos;m driving .
i &apos;m right here .
please , i am very hungover
and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval .
sheldon , i do hope you &apos;ll forgive me
for my inappropriate behavior last night .
i don &apos;t blame you .
you were intoxicated .
thank you .
i blame penny .
i blame penny , too .
bad penny .
wait a minute , what are you talking about ?
what inappropriate behavior ?
i think it &apos;s best that you not know .
agreed .
agreed .
what the hell-- agreed .
and i want you to take very good care of this young woman .
oh , thank you , beverly .
you &apos;re welcome .
she doesn &apos;t have much in the way of career prospects .
don &apos;t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well .
mother , remember when i was complaining
that you don &apos;t communicate with me enough ?
yes , dear .
i &apos;m over it .
