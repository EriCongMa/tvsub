I want some of your study aid,
the kind with the childproof cap.
It looks like you haven't been sleeping.
I just really have a headache.
And you're lying again.
I'm visiting my dad.
He's lecturing in Syracuse.
We could have this place. It could be our secret.
I'm tired of lying.
It belongs to Alison.
Alison's running out of money,
and Shana's the only one who knows how to reach her.
One of Alison's stories kept on sticking in my brain.
It's The Hart and Huntsman, where Alison's mystery man
took her for pie ane beer.
I went to The Hart and Huntsman
and Ezra was there eating the pie.
The pie and the beer! Board Shorts Ale!
You think he's "A"? We have to call Aria.
I don't think we should tell her
until we're a hundred percent sure.
You wanted to see me?
Please, come in. And, uh, close the door.
How many Gold Stick variations are there?
Thirty-two. They'll never miss us.
Aria still isn't answering.
What are you gonna say if we get her?
"Isn't it funny how your old boyfriend
turned out to be a stalking whackjob?"
I'd like to know a lot more before we talk to her.
You take that side of the desk,
you take the file cabinet.
What are we looking for?
Evidence.
We're gonna need a lot more if we're going to prove to Aria
that Ezra's...
not who he says he is.
That he's "A."
How are we going to convince Aria
if we can't even say it out loud?
If I was a teacher and my students
only got me coffee mugs,
I would so start flunking people.
Tell me that's what it looks like?
Ali's journal.
So that was Ezra at the cabin?
We always knew there were two of them.
Ezra and Shana?
Ezra and somebody.
What is Mona doing here?
I don't know.
Is she looking for the book?
How should I know?
Quiet.
Why is Mona stealing papers from Mr. Fitz?
Maybe she isn't stealing them.
Maybe she's delivering them.
Shouldn't we do this in your room?
My parents are out of town, being lawyers.
Sounds romantic.
One's in Chicago, the other one's in Boston.
I don't think there are any pages missing.
Okay, are you, like, getting a cold?
Allergies.
What about the phone number and email addresses
I found with the money?
I have a reverse directory for that phone number.
We can send emails to those addresses,
but we should do it from someplace that can't be traced.
What do we know about Shana?
That she's missing.
No, I mean, really. What do we know?
She was with Paige.
Can we please not go there.
I'm just saying, we don't have a lot of details about that.
Not those kind of details. I mean,
did Shana ever mention anything about Georgia,
something that connects with where Ali's hiding?
I thought you didn't want us looking for Ali.
I think "A" changed the rules on that.
I'm in the same place Emily is--
I'm more angry than I am scared.
What do you want me to do?
Interrogate my girlfriend about her summer fling?
Basically.
Isn't there some sort of Mona-Fitz connection
we should be worrying about?
I cannot worry about anything else. My brain is full.
So's mine.
We'll tag up on this later. Aria should be back by then.
What?
Did it ever occur to you guys
that we found that book awfully easy?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking what if it wasn't "A"
who put that book in the desk?
Em, get real, this is all about the A-ness of things.
I might have not said like that, but Hanna's right.
I love when you say that.
What are you thinking?
You don't want to know.
Try me.
I'm thinking it's Sunday night
and I still have a lot of homework to do.
Creative writing homework?
Okay, you're gonna like this one when I'm done.
It started out as one thing
and then it just turned into something completely different.
How'd that happen?
I had this hero, but heroes aren't what they used to be
so I got fascinated with a villain.
Does your villain lose in the end?
I'm not sure.
Sometimes the villain wins.
Sometimes.
"Down these mean streets a man must go
who is not himself mean."
You've been holding out on me.
Toby?
I wouldn't say no to a drink.
I need to know what you know.
About what?
About Alison.
How am I supposed to help you
if you won't level with me?
I don't know what you mean.
You know exactly what I mean.
This started out as a job.
It's something else now, and you know it.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Trust you?
You're spread so thin, I can see right through you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
They help me focus.
That's all they do.
Who's kidding who?
Thanks.
Here, Let me get that for you.
I can pay for my own coffee.
It's fifteen cents. I'm good for it.
Keep the change, hon.
Thanks.
Tell you the truth,
that's kind of my way of saying sorry.
For what?
I don't like the way our conversation went the other day.
I don't think it helped either one of us.
Yeah, well, sometimes I have trouble
taking constructive criticism.
I perceive it as a threat.
I'm the same way.
Have you been back to The Hart and Huntsman?
No, not since I saw you there.
Maybe I can buy you lunch sometime.
Or dinner.
Maybe.
Well, let me know what's good for you.
I will.
Promise?
Promise.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
The more I see of men, the more I want to get a dog.
Too bad there isn't another alternative.
Too bad.
So he just paid for your cup of coffee?
Left a ten-cent tip.
On a cup of coffee? What a waste.
Glad Aria's done with him.
Is she?
You think she started up with Ezra and didn't tell us?
Show of hands: Who hasn't lied about
something romantic to the rest of the group?
I rest my case.
What do we do?
You're President of the Man-Haters Club,
how would you feel about keeping an eye on Ezra Fitz?
I was born for the job.
Morning, troops.
Aria. How was Syracuse?
Oh, it was fine.
You have a good time with your dad?
Yeah, real good time.
Did you make it down to The Erie Canal Museum?
Ah, it was closed.
Too bad.
So, what did I miss around here?
Nothing much.
Well, It's time to go wrestle the world to its knees.
You really have been to The Erie Canal Museum, haven't you?
Twice.
Fitzgerald Art Foundation.
Is this Edgewood 5-0139?
Yes, it is.
And you said Fitzgerald Art Foundation?
Yes, ma'am.
To whom do you wish to speak?
I thought you were gonna go easy on that stuff.
Haven't you ever heard of knocking before you come in a room?
I've heard of it,
I just don't subscribe to the practice.
You learn a lot more walking in uninvited.
Those pills.
They're not going to help you figure this out.
You've already got most of the pieces.
Suppose you tell me how everything fits together.
I thought you were the smart one.
I am the smart one.
When did that get here?
I have no idea.
All those pills, Spencer.
Not good.
Almost looks like she could step right out of the frame
and kiss you.
Or laugh in your face.
Suppose she did?
Step out of that painting.
Suppose she was alive, somewhere?
You trying to tell me something?
Just asking.
Not much chance of that, is there?
Men.
Why are you asking me about Shana now?
That was a long time ago.
Not that long.
I told you what happened.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm not asking you to apologize.
Then why are you asking me about her?
I thought about you when I was with her.
I can't believe I just said that.
That's what a boy says when he cheats.
I feel almost normal.
Maybe I should go.
I'll go first.
I don't mind.
You always leave first.
Aren't you afraid people will notice that, too?
I have to leave first.
Why?
Because I can't stand to see you walk away from me.
Will I see you later?
I don't know.
Lose something, honey?
Hello?
There's a blonde package waiting for you.
Apartment 3B. You know the address.
Mona?
Better hurry up, while she's still breathing.
You all right?
Never better.
When you put a tail on somebody,
you shouldn't trust it to an amateur.
I'm not as used to walking the streets as Mona is.
Come over here and say that.
Mona, how about fixing our guests a drink?
My own juice blend.
Made me what I am today.
I thought you only drank Board Shorts Ale.
When I can get it.
You thirsty?
Not especially.
Then let's blow.
Suits me.
How come you had this one to camp out on my doorstep?
You piqued my interest.
About what?
You and Aria.
What about me and Aria?
Are you back together?
True love honey, just can't kill it.
Nix.
I'm only going to tell you this once.
Leave Aria alone.
If that's what you want,
why don't you just tell her about me?
Tell her who you think I am.
That should fix everything, right?
But you haven't.
Why not?
Spencer, let's go.
I'll tell you why not if you want me to.
It's that you're not sure.
You're not sure about anything.
You're in over your head and you know it.
I know what I'm doing.
Really?
Look around you, Spencer.
Look at where you are right now
and tell me you're not cracking up.
Let 'em go.
Thanks for the buffet.
I want you to know, that was the last carrot stick.
What is it with men?
Why do they always turn on you?
Not all of them.
Is it because they wear hats
and the blood gets stuck in their heads?
I don't know.
You know, I heard that's what causes baldness.
Hanna, not helping.
Well, I got you out of that apartment, didn't I?
Yeah, you did. Thanks.
Some rescue team I am.
Are you okay?
I will be.
I traced that number on Ali's list.
It's the Fitzgerald Art Foundation.
Fitzgerald as in Fitz?
That's right.
And you think Ali called that number?
Well, I figure, you're the one who works at the switchboard.
You could be the one to find out.
So when you're done with the roll
you take it to the drugstore
and a week later you pick up your pictures.
That's great. Thanks.
Where you going?
Delaware Water Gap. Canoe trip.
Oh, by yourself?
No, not alone.
Emily said she'd come.
Emily?
I don't think of her as a tomboy.
She isn't.
I used to be a real tomboy.
I would spend more time in the tree in our front yard
than I would in my own bedroom.
What changed?
I don't know.
Yes, I do.
I fell in love for the first time.
That's when I lost all my interest in tree climbing.
I guess you just grow out of it.
That's what they say.
I'll tell you what I know about people.
They're no damn good.
Everybody's out for themselves.
That's the simple truth.
If I'm no damn good, why are you talking to me?
Because we have something in common.
We both know what happens
when a man lets a skirt get to him.
He makes mistakes.
Walks into trouble with his eyes wide open
and ends up in trouble all by himself.
I have some information
that might help you with all that trouble.
What's this information gonna cost me?
Consider it a gift, from one lodge brother to another.
Alison DiLaurentis is alive.
And Spencer Hastings knows how to find her.
Alison DiLaurentis is dead.
Says who?
It's a good likeness, don't you think?
He did a wonderful job.
I should have been nicer to him.
Ali.
Why didn't you tell us about Ezra Fitz?
It makes me angry though, the portrait.
It'll always look like that, but I won't.
That's why it's smart to disappear,
you'll always be the girl in the painting.
That is immortality, my darling.
Were you watching?
Did you see him go after her?
Why didn't you warn Aria?
No woman has ever been able
to warn another woman about a man.
Is he who you're afraid of?
Is that why you can't come back?
Can I get one straight answer from you about anything?
And what would be the fun of that?
I swear, if you don't stop it right now...
That is a scary look, Spencer.
Maybe you should be the one I'm afraid of.
I'm just trying to figure this out.
You have all the pieces.
So why can't you put them together?
Maybe you need a little more help from those special pills.
Do you have enough?
And what happens if you run out?
Snap out of it!
Look!
Sit down.
Is Alison alive or dead?
She's dead. Everybody knows that.
That's not what you said before.
I was confused.
Confused about her being dead
or confused about telling me the truth?
Just confused.
Spencer doesn't get confused.
Spencer's the smart one.
Maybe smart enough to get away with murder.
Maybe.
Or maybe smart enough
to help Ali fake the whole thing.
Or maybe she tricked you into helping.
You ever consider that?
I always thought champagne
was the most sophisticated thing in the world.
Well, it isn't.
You are.
I want to tell my friends, about us.
That's a big secret.
You're sure, you can trust them?
I trust them with my life.
I have.
Do they trust you?
What do you mean?
I mean, you want them to know everything about us,
but do you know everything about them?
Do you know all their secrets?
The important ones.
I bet you...
I know one of your secrets.
I bet you don't.
Alison's alive.
I'm looking for Mr. Willeken.
Just one moment. I'll connect you.
Can you put through Mr. Kane on Lockwood-3?
Just one moment, I'll connect you to your party.
Listen, Mabel, I'm trying to track down
one crummy phone number.
How many favors have I done for you?
Remember those three sailors?
All right.
So a place like this Fitzgerald outfit,
they send all their night calls to an answering service.
I want to know which one.
Terrific.
Call me back.
Hello.
Just one moment, I'll connect you to the long-distance operator.
So many people in this city.
Why does it feel so lonely?
Are you afraid of being lonely?
I'm afraid of being alone.
I won't let that happen.
I'm scared.
Me, too.
What if people find out?
Then they will be insanely jealous of me.
Of me.
Of us.
All-Night Answering Service?
Yes, it is.
You can really save my neck.
My boss is Mr. Fitzgerald,
and I lost a very important phone number.
Okay.
This is from somebody who called after hours
and I hope you kept a copy of that message.
Maybe.
It'd be from Alison.
Could you check that for me?
Hold just a sec.
Sure, I'll hold.
Secrets aren't just secrets.
They're weapons.
Things you keep in you pocket till you need them.
I learned that from Ali.
You learned the same thing.
I know something else.
"A" didn't just come out of the woodwork.
A monster like that, you have to take care of it,
nurture it.
And that's just what Ali did.
She was feeding the beast with every dirty trick,
every lie she got us to tell.
It all made "A" stronger.
You know who "A" is.
I'm not so sure anymore.
Oh, cut it, Spencer.
First it was Mona, then it wasn't.
Maybe I know or maybe I'm just looking into another mask.
Ali is alive.
Who told you that?
Never mind.
She's alive and you know how to find her.
No, I don't.
Maybe you don't have the exact address,
but you know the next step.
I've got nothing.
All I've got is a book filled with cruel stories
and fake names and bad poetry.
That's right, you've got the book.
And why do you suppose that is?
Since when does the devil give out free samples?
Think about it.
I don't want to think about it.
I'm so tired of thinking. I just want to sleep.
原文中"女孩"为"男人"
"Down these mean streets a girl must go
who is not herself mean."
Hello.
Hi.
You all right?
If I tell you something,
you promise me you won't give me the look?
What look?
The Spencer look.
The look that you give everyone
when you're really disappointed in them.
I didn't know I had an official look for that.
Oh, you do.
I'll try.
I've been seeing Ezra again.
Really seeing him, if you know what I mean.
I think so.
You said it yourself.
I liked Jake, but I love Ezra.
I do love Ezra.
Who are you trying to convince?
Well, everything that's happened with him and me,
I don't feel like it's ever happened to anyone else before.
And it probably wouldn't have happened to me
if I hadn't walked through that one door that one time.
It all would have been different.
And who decides what door you walk through, anyway?
I wish I knew.
It's been sexy and dangerous and...
awful and wonderful.
It's like a story.
It was perfect.
"Was" Perfect?
You used the past tense.
I think the story is changing.
Aria, there's something that I have to tell you,
but I'm afraid I'm going to get a lot more from you
than just a look.
What is it?
I've been leaving you messages everywhere.
What happened?
I found Ali.
Here?
The calls came from here?
That's not how you spell "Nightly."
You think that Alison's in there? Why?
Because someone called the number on that contact sheet
from a pay phone in this club.
That's Alison.
Hiding in plain sight and doing three shows a night.
It looks like somebody threw a hand grenade
into a room full of Rockettes.
This isn't right. Ali can't be here.
Well, this is where the call came from.
Did anybody see you come in here?
We don't think so.
Then get the hell out.
Ali...
I told you not to come look for me.
Well, things have changed.
Maybe for you, but not for me.
I mean, are you trying to get me killed?
This one already tried once.
Don't talk to me like that.
Don't talk to us like that.
Ali, we want you back.
Are you sure about that?
I bet this one would love it if something happened to me.
That way she wouldn't have to worry about dropping down
to second place if I came back.
What is wrong with you?
Aren't you sick and tired of her ordering you around?
You are way out of line.
Am I, Emily? Am I really?
Start thinking for yourself,
instead of letting Spencer think for you.
Well, maybe she's right.
Maybe it's time we all start thinking for ourselves.
Let's see how long you last out here without us.
Spencer, what are you talking about?
You're setting us up for something.
I don't know what it is, but it's a set-up.
And we're supposed to be some kind of decoy for you
and take all the heat.
But you only ever tell us what you want us to know.
It's always been that way.
And you're different?
Yeah, I'm different.
Has she told you?
Told me what?
Aria...
Split up, go different ways.
Get whoever it is to follow us so you can get away?
Don't even think about it.
Aria? Are you in there?
Aria?
It's Ezra.
Don't answer.
What are you talking about? It's Ezra.
Don't let him know where we are.
You better tell her.
Shut up, Ali.
Who sharpened your tongue, little girl?
It's safe.
You can come out now. I'll take care of you.
Ezra!
I don't know what they've told you about me,
but it's not true.
You guys gonna tell her,
or is that supposed to be my job?
Well, somebody better tell me something.
I'll keep you safe Aria, I promise.
I love you.
No one has ever loved you the way I do.
You can't trust him.
Why?
No guts.
I think I liked you better when you were dead.
No.
We don't have much time.
I hit him hard, but I only hit him once.
Wait. Where's Ali?
She's gone. Get in.
Go.
Why did Toby hit him?
Ali was right.
None of us has any guts.
You figure it out yet?
I wish you'd stop saying that.
Have you?
'Cause this car is just about out of gas.
So am I.
I'm just so damn tired.
We're all tired, Spencer.
Figure it out, so we can get on with our lives.
No matter who gets hurt.
You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
What is that supposed to mean?
Maybe you're afraid of finding out the whole truth.
She already has the truth.
Where is it? In the book?
Where in the book?
Look at the pages.
Don't look at the book, look at the pages.
That's the same thing.
No, it's not.
How thin can a sandwich get?
Here, take half of mine.
Take it all, I can't eat.
That's because you've been packing away steaks behind my back.
Oh, stop it, will ya?
I got more on my mind than food.
It wouldn't be that gal
that beat me out of my breakfast, would it?
You're pretty sharp, aren't ya?
Well, it's not what you think.
That's exactly what I think.
We were supposed to find it.
But why give the book back
after going to all that trouble to steal it?
Because now it's a Trojan Horse.
Look.
There are changes, little changes that have to add up.
Like here it says,
"I can't stop thinking of Ambrose Pierson."
But in the picture I took in the car, it says,
"I can't stop thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."
What's Ambrose Pavilion?
I don't know, but it was a big enough clue
that whoever stole this book
wanted to make sure we never saw it,
in fact that we saw something else.
Are all the changes like that?
Yeah, so far.
January becomes March, a cute girl becomes a cute guy.
And "A" thinks we won't notice
because we'll think we're so smart for getting it back.
But "A" doesn't know that I have the original pages on my phone.
So we have our edge back.
You're saying that Ezra left that book for us to find.
Which means he knows we know.
We have to tell Aria.
She's still not answering.
Then we'll sit on her porch
until she gets back from Albany.
Syracuse.
Wait.
Just let me try calling her one more time
before we wake up the whole house.
Guys.
