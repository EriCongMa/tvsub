kites , ho !
kites , ho !
excuse me .
you &apos;re misusing the word &quot; ho . &quot;
it &apos;s an interjection used to call attention
to a destination , not an object , as in , uh , &quot; land , ho ! &quot;
or , uh , &quot; westward , ho ! &quot;
kites , ho !
hey , guys . whatcha doin &apos; ?
going out to discover electricity ?
if you &apos;re referring to the work of benjamin franklin ,
he did not &quot; discover electricity , &quot;
he merely used a kite to determine
that lightning &quot; consists &quot; of electricity .
he also invented the franklin stove ,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter .
kites , ho .
we &apos;re heading out for some kite fighting .
&quot; kite fighting &quot; ?
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s an extremely competitive , cutthroat sport .
well , actually , the risk of throat cutting is very low .
on the other hand , severe string burn is a real
and ever @-@ present danger .
you want to come watch ?
oh , gee ...
sounds amazing .
but , um , i &apos;ve got some friends coming over .
not a big thing-- we &apos;re just
gonna watch the nebraska game .
oh . football , sure .
good guess .
i would &apos;ve invited you , but i know you &apos;re not a football fan .
no , no , i &apos;m not , so ... great .
you &apos;ve got plans
doing something you like , i &apos;ve got plans
doing something i like , so it &apos;s good .
well , maybe we &apos;ll hang out later--
you know , after everybody &apos;s gone .
yeah , great .
see ya .
well , this sucks .
i &apos;m sorry , i got bored and drifted off .
where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie ?
leonard just realized that penny &apos;s been hiding him
from her friends because he &apos;s a tiny , little man
who flies kites .
oh , that certainly would suck .
wolowitz is trying to outflank us .
let out some string , add altitude
and i &apos;ll go under and cut his line .
why wouldn &apos;t penny want her friends to meet me ?
focus , leonard , focus !
the heat of battle is upon us .
the dogs of war are unleashed .
maybe koothrappali &apos;s right .
maybe i embarrass her .
you &apos;re embarrassing me right now .
a grown man worrying about such nonsense
when in the middle of flying kites .
sorry .
sorry won &apos;t bring their kites down .
string burn ! string burn !
oh , they think we &apos;re flanking .
they &apos;re playing right into our hands .
on the count of three , we execute the flying scissor .
one , two ...
whoa !
did you see that ?
see what ?
that chick-- she smiled at me .
no , she didn &apos;t .
yes , she did .
come on , scissors , scissors !
hold my line .
wait .
what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t scissors by myself !
howard ! come back !
victory !
son of a bitch .
you &apos;re a sucky friend , you know that ?
a sucky , sucky friend .
what was supposed to do ?
she gave me that &quot; come @-@ hither &quot; look .
if she gave you any look at all. it was a &quot; you suck &quot; look .
i would &apos;ve caught up to her if i hadn &apos;t pulled a hammy .
oh , please , you weigh 80 pounds .
you don &apos;t have a hammy .
so , penny doesn &apos;t want me around her friends .
i embarrass her . what else could it be ?
well , her actions
could be out of concern for your feelings
perhaps she &apos;s excluded you from these gatherings
because she &apos;s scouting for a new mate
and don &apos;t want to do it in front of you .
oh ... how kind of her .
agreed .
most primates don &apos;t show that sort of discretion .
a female bonobo will copulate with a new male
in front of the old one
without so much as a &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
you always do this , you know ?
you ditch me for a woman you don &apos;t have a shot with .
i totally had a shot . with a woman
you were chasing through a park--
that &apos;s not a shot , that &apos;s a felony .
what &apos;s worse , it cost me my prized patang fighting kite .
sheldon , i don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s any chance
you could give me my kite back ?
i &apos;m sorry , raj , but the rules of aerial warfare
dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor .
and without rules , the competition has no meaning .
and without meaning ,
the following would be an empty gesture .
i have your kite .
how was your football party ?
it was pretty good . we won .
oh , wow .
that &apos;s excellent .
it &apos;s a weird figure of speech , isn &apos;t it
&quot; we won &quot; when you weren &apos;t actually playing .
when we watch star wars ,
we don &apos;t say , &quot; we defeated the empire . &quot;
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
oh , hey , on a related subject ,
are you embarrassed to have me around your friends ?
oh , my god , no .
why would you ask that ?
well , you know , i just noticed
i haven &apos;t really met any of them .
sure you have .
yeah , no , i met the huge ex @-@ boyfriend
and the smaller yet still larger than me ex @-@ boyfriend
by the way , were they here today ?
of course not .
of course not .
why would they be ? why would i ask ?
why am i rambling ? why don &apos;t you stop me ?
leonard , look ,
if you want to meet my friends , that would be great .
i just , you know , i didn &apos;t want you to be bored .
i wouldn &apos;t be bored .
why would i be bored ?
well , &apos; cause they &apos;re not genius scientists .
penny , i like all sorts of people .
in fact , some of my best friends aren &apos;t geniuses .
like who ?
okay , some of my facebook friends aren &apos;t geniuses .
my point is , if we &apos;re going to be a couple ,
i should be friends with your friends .
okay , great . well , then why don &apos;t you
come over next saturday and watch the game with us .
another football game ?
they have them every week .
did not know that .
you wanted to meet my friends .
sure .
sure , just i don &apos;t know much about football .
oh , that &apos;s okay-- a lot of the guys&apos;
girlfriends don &apos;t know football .
they just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen .
great .
okay , a complete pass .
first down , new england .
i think i &apos;m starting to get this .
really ?
the only thing i &apos;ve learned in the last two hours
is that american men love drinking beer ,
pee too often and have trouble getting erections .
focus on the game , not the commercials , raj .
i &apos;m just saying , maybe if you people cut back on the beer ,
you could get out of the bathroom
and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help .
raj , what are you doing here ?
you were supposed to help me pimp out my vespa .
i &apos;m sorry ,
are you under the impression that we &apos;re still friends ?
oh , come on .
you &apos;re not still grinding on the kite thing , are you ?
it &apos;s not just the kite thing .
every time we go some place , you think you can just
dump me whenever someone prettier comes along ,
even though you don &apos;t have a shot with them .
i had a shot with that jogger .
fine . paint green flames on your little scooter with her .
it &apos;s not a little scooter .
it &apos;s the second biggest vespa they make !
are you watching football ?
there &apos;s no fooling you .
now , what is this sacks statistic they put up there ?
all i know about sacks is , my mother shops there .
sacks , sacks ...
it &apos;s football nom for when a quarterback is tackled
behind the line of scrimmage .
scrimmage .
the line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line
separating the offense from the defense .
sheldon knows football ?
apparently .
i mean , quidditch , sure . but football ?
sheldon , how do you know this stuff ?
i grew up in texas .
football is ubiquitous in texas :
pro football , college football ,
high school football , peewee football ...
in fact , every form of football except the original--
european football .
which most texans believe to be a commie plot .
unbelivable .
if you &apos;re interested , i also know all about frying meat
that isn &apos;t chicken as if it were chicken .
so you could teach me ?
football or chicken @-@ fried meats ?
football .
i &apos;m going to penny &apos;s on saturday
to watch a game with her friends
and i don &apos;t want to look lik an idiot . i want to blend in .
if you want to blend in with penny &apos;s friends ,
i &apos;d think looking like an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage .
come on , sheldon , please teach me about football .
it &apos;ll be fun .
that &apos;s exactly what my father said .
&quot; come to the games . watch the games . &quot;
week in and week out from the time
i was five until i went off to college .
longest seven years of my life .
please , i &apos;m asking you as a friend .
are you making this a tier one friendship request ?
yes .
fine .
i really appreciate this .
yeah , yeah .
all right , poindexter , sit down , shut up and listen .
i &apos;m sorry ?
that &apos;s how my father always began
our football conversations .
and if you &apos;d like ,
after the game ,
i &apos;ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot
close enough to racoon that craps itself .
when are you going to stop making cylon toast ?
when i have enough to destroy all the human toast
on the battlestar known as galactica .
is that what you &apos;re wearing to watch football at penny &apos;s ?
what &apos;s wrong with a football jersey ?
nothing .
that , however , appears to be a football cocktail dress .
i &apos;s the smallest size they had ,
except the one for dogs .
i can &apos;t believe they had one for dogs .
oh , yes .
canine football fans are a common sight in texas .
cats , however , refuse to wear sporting apparel .
my sister found that out the hard way .
anyway , wish me luck .
leonard , wait .
am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted
by penny &apos;s pair to ensure
your continuing mating privileges with her ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t put it exactly that way
how would you put it ?
yeah , okay , like you said .
huh . seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse .
don &apos;t you have access to women who will do it for money ?
by the way .
another accepted usage for the term &quot; ho . &quot;
good @-@ bye , sheldon .
hold on
i believe that social convention
dictate you not arriving empty @-@ handed .
would you like to bring some cylon toast ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m trying to fit in , not get laughed at .
what &apos;s funny about cylon toast ?
it &apos;s open .
hey , pal .
what do you want ?
i brought you a little gift .
new kite .
the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang ,
indian fighting kite
that my brother sent to me from new delhi .
it took me a day to put together and two days to paint .
this is hello kitty .
yeah , but it comes with a little coin purse .
does a patang ?
wow , you just don &apos;t get it , do you ?
buying me something pretty isn &apos;t going
to make our problem just go away .
look , i admit i haven &apos;t always been
the best friend i could be .
y &apos;ve been a sucky friend , a sucky , &lt; i &gt; sucky &lt; / i &gt; friend .
stipulated .
and you do it all the time .
last week in the mall at radio shack , we were looking
for a phone with giant numbers for your mother ,
and i suddenly realize you &apos;re not even there .
i know , i know ...
and where were you ?
getting shot down by the girl at hot dog on a stick .
but in my defense , she was gorgeous !
and working that squeezer to make the lemonade ,
going and down and up and down .
it was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court .
you &apos;re impossible .
hey , at least i can talk to women
without being drunk .
excuse me , i have selective mutism ,
a recognized medical disorder .
you &apos;re just a douche .
no . you know what ?
maybe that &apos;s what this whole thing &apos;s about .
you &apos;re not mad at me ,
you &apos;re mad at yourself .
no , i &apos;m mad at you .
i hate myself , but i &apos;m mad at you .
fine . you &apos;re mad at me . i get it .
how about we go spend the day together ?
just the two of us .
we &apos;ll go anywhere you want .
i don &apos;t know .
come on .
let me take you someplace nice .
i @-@ i do enjoy the la brea tar pits .
really , now ? with the traffic and the parking ?
okay , fine .
the tar pits . let &apos;s go .
oh , why can &apos;t i stay mad at you ?
go ! go ! go !
go @-@ go @-@ go @-@ go ! yes !
are you people watching this ?
is this amazing or what ?
sweetie , that &apos;s a highlight
from the &apos; 98 championship game .
oh . did not know that .
how much beer have you had ?
none , why ?
oh . i was just kind of hoping you were drunk .
now we &apos;re back live .
okay , yeah .
i can see the difference .
oh , where &apos;s the flag ? that &apos;s intentional grounding .
totally .
that completely was a forward pass ,
which they threw intentionally incomplete
to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re not
being penalized with the loss of a down
and by having to move the line of scrimmage
back to the spot of the foul .
here , have some pizza , sweetie .
penny , you know i &apos;m lactose intolerant .
i know . i just need you stop talking .
penny . penny . penny .
sheldon , come in .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to make a sandwich , but i &apos;m out of bread .
there &apos;s some in the fridge .
you shouldn &apos;t keep your bread in the refrigerator .
staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules ,
which occurs faster at cool temperatures .
on earth , we say &quot; thank you . &quot;
so leonard , how goes the mimesis ?
&quot; mimesis &quot; ?
you know . mimesis .
an action in which the mimic takes on the properties
of a specific object or organism .
mimesis .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m attempting to communicate with you
without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you .
let me try again .
have the indigenous fauna
accepted you as one of their own ?
nudge , nudge , wink , wink .
oh , i guess so .
good . oh , fyi .
after i eat my sandwich , i &apos;m taking koothrappali &apos;s
patang kite out for a test run .
would you like to get your delta @-@ wing raptor and join me ?
i don &apos;t want to fly kites , sheldon .
we &apos;re watching football here .
i can see that .
i was providing you with an alternative .
a courtesy i was never offered in similar circumstances .
oh , look at that .
the oklahoma coach throw down a red flag
indicating he &apos;s challenging the ruling on the field .
i hope he &apos;s right , &apos; cause if he &apos;not ,
it &apos;ll cost him one of his three time @-@ outs .
you know , leonard , honey ,
i wouldn &apos;t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with sheldon .
no , i &apos;ll watch the end of the game .
besides , there &apos;s only three minutes left .
until halftime .
this is justalf ?
we &apos;ve been here for hours .
and you &apos;re gonna be here for a couple more .
oh , you &apos;re kidding me .
no .
nice meeting all of you .
so , yeah , anyway , that &apos;s my boyfriend .
he is really smart .
i really like my saber @-@ toothed cat .
thank you .
my pleasure .
maybe after lunch , we can go to marie callender &apos;s
and have some pie .
i &apos;d like it .
this is turning out to be a perfect saturday .
good.i &apos;m glad .
oh , man . did you see the way she smiled at me ?
fine . go ahead .
no . this is our day .
if you want to chase after her , chase after her .
ah , who am i kidding ? i wouldn &apos;t have a shot with a girl like that .
don &apos;t put yourself down .
you &apos;re a very attractive man .
you think so ?
yeah .
absolutely . it wouldn &apos;t kill you
to take a pilates class with me now and then ,
but you have a certain wiry appeal
yeah , well , it doesn &apos;t matter
&apos;cause she wasn &apos;t really smiling at me .
actually , in this case , i think she was .
really ?
yeah .
bye .
