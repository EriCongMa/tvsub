you &apos;re still on that thing ?
what are you constantly looking at on your computer ?
is that a question
you really want people asking around here ?
indeed , it is not .
i &apos;m just checking college acceptances .
i mean , they should be posting them any day .
you cannot spend your entire spring break
worrying about college admissions .
you should go to that -- that music festival thing with haley .
do something fun . learn to relax a --
do we have to keep every remote we have ever owned ?
somewhere in a landfill , a laser disc just ejected .
uh , i can &apos;t bring alex to the festival
because i am going for work to research new fashion trends .
i need to blend in , you know ?
everyone will think she &apos;s a cop .
well , i could sit here and worry and ruin my day ,
or i could go with haley and ruin hers .
i &apos;ll grab my sunscreen .
good morning .
hey , dad .
i hate to shame you , but haley woke up before you .
well , haley didn &apos;t run a 10k yesterday
to raise awareness for alopecia .
what &apos;s alopecia ?
that is why i run .
honey , i could really use your help
with spring cleaning today .
i got to get all these boxes down to the donation center .
wish i could , but i &apos;ve got work .
then luke and i have got some important trampolining to do .
i just love how equally we divide our responsibilities .
figured we &apos;d do a little father / son bonding
since your school trip was canceled .
you can teach me the dunphy tuck .
i love your enthusiasm , son , but it &apos;s way too dangerous .
one wrong move , and you &apos;re eating springs .
oh , no , no , those are --
is that my banjo ?
when i met this little lady sitting next to me ,
it was love at first sight .
yep , i &apos;ve been noodling around on the ol &apos; flyswatter
for a couple of years now .
i was inspired by the greats
- scruggs , kermit .
it &apos;s hard to practice , though ,
because it gets claire so hot and bothered .
what do you -- - i think i &apos;ve heard enough .
lucky for you ,
i &apos;ve got time for a couple verses of &quot; shortnin &apos; bread . &quot;
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , it &apos;s in the box . it &apos;s leaving the house .
i @-@ i can never hear that awful thing again .
but you called me &quot; banjovi . &quot;
i know .
i did whatever was necessary to make it stop .
wait . does that mean you also didn &apos;t like my bagpiping ?
is that why we have luke ? !
it &apos;s not .
is it ?
ay , cam , no dessert for you ?
no , none for me .
i have to fit into a skintight cat costume tonight
because i &apos;m gonna --
whatever you do behind closed doors
is your own business .
because i &apos;m singing &quot; memory &quot; at the faculty follies .
it &apos;s a fundraiser
where the teachers do a little talent show .
ay , maybe i come see you .
i need to find something to watch
since i had to give up my soap operas .
oh , because you &apos;ve been neglecting joe ?
no , it &apos;s because i asked jay to stop smoking cigars ,
and he said that he would quit
if i stopped watching the soap operas .
but it &apos;s very hard .
what &apos;s so damn hard ?
it &apos;s the same thing every week --
amnesia , evil twins ,
two ladies end up fighting in a fountain .
i mean , what is it ? is it some sort of an escape ?
it &apos;s better than blowing smoke in our baby &apos;s face .
where did he go , anyways ?
oh , there &apos;s an e @-@ mail from lily &apos;s scout camp .
i hope everything &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s fine .
mitchell &apos;s nervous because he &apos;s not a camper .
his idea of roughing it is a hotel stay
where the cable doesn &apos;t get bravo .
they should tell you that when you check in .
oh , boy . okay , here &apos;s a photo , look .
she &apos;s using the signal .
what signal ?
the kids aren &apos;t allowed to call their parents ,
but the camp sends out photos ,
so we have a code .
yeah , &quot; we . &quot;
one finger , she &apos;s fine .
two fingers , she &apos;s unhappy .
look at this -- two fingers .
i don &apos;t look at pictures on a phone .
if it &apos;s a good shot , get a print , put it in an album .
interesting time to take a stand .
but she looks like she &apos;s just doing
the bunny ears behind her girlfriend .
which is exactly what she would do
to get a secret signal past the authorities .
okay , it &apos;s a scout camp , not leavenworth .
she &apos;s smiling . what are you worried about ?
because it &apos;s her first time away from home . it --
you know what ? that &apos;s probably it .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m stressing out , so --
you know , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna go to the office
and pick up some papwork .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna tag along with you .
you can drop me off at the club .
i &apos;m not really going to the office .
don &apos;t care . need a cigar .
based off the walk i just took ,
side @-@ boob is the new butt crack .
so , you want to head down front ?
alex !
okay , you need to drink this .
i &apos;ll get a new one .
uh , is there vodka in here ?
if there is , it &apos;s not doing anybody any good
until i get it in there .
michelangelo talked about chiseling
beautiful sculptures out of marble .
well , my chisel is a long island iced tea ,
and i use it to free the party girl from the block of nerd .
music ! !
yeah !
not all my sculptures are masterpieces .
i &apos;m ho--
oh , amazing !
honey , were you listening ? isn &apos;t he good ?
really good .
yeah .
really good .
i -- i thought you didn &apos;t like the banjo .
i didn &apos;t think i did , either ,
but there &apos;s just something about the way he plays .
it &apos;s so ... it &apos;s so musical .
so , what &apos;s this , a surprise for old dad ?
you been secretly taking lessons for months , probably longer ?
nope . i just started messing around with it today .
and you learned a whole song .
actually , he learned two ! play him the other one .
i &apos;m good , thanks .
are those my shoes ?
i found them in the box of donations .
they fit him perfectly .
if anything , they &apos;re a little snug .
well , he can kick them off ,
&apos;cause we are about to do some trampolining .
time to learn the dunphy tuck .
i thought you said he could get hurt doing that .
it &apos;s impossible to be safe all the time .
you can get hurt just walking into your own house .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go hang my costume up
in my dressing room and start warming up my voice .
dressing room ? ay , show me .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s the handicapped stall in the men &apos;s room .
but tonight is not about cameron tucker .
it &apos;s about the kids .
coach tucker .
senor kaplan .
what is that , a caveman costume ?
no , i just signed up
to sing &quot; memory &quot; from &quot; cats . &quot;
although i hope i &apos;m not on
after the &quot; grease &quot; chorus .
they &apos;re a tough act to follow .
&quot; memory &quot; ?
but that is your song .
&quot; memory &quot; ? but that was his song .
two cat costumes ?
well , we can &apos;t both sing the same song .
i mean , that would make a mockery of the follies .
oh , well , i sang last year .
please , i insist -- you sing .
he gave up his song .
that was his song last year .
fate will smile upon him .
you would do that for me ?
this is literally the nicest gesture
i have ever witnessed --
and i &apos;m from canada .
i don &apos;t like this .
this is just like when rosalba and marisol
found out that they were married to the same man .
marisol backed down ,
but she was found dead two days later .
okay , gloria , i think there &apos;s a chance
you &apos;re trying to turn a very normal situation
into one of your soap operas .
okay , but imagine --
a standing ovation for you will crush him !
you know what ?
i &apos;ll only look better
if i take the high road --
you know , help out backstage , let him have his moment .
oh , my goodness !
the move you &apos;re about to see was first developed
by my great @-@ great @-@ great- grandfather razvan dunphy ,
but , really ,
it &apos;s as old as man &apos;s quest to fly .
it &apos;s just a flip with a twist , right ?
there &apos;s a lot more going on ,
but you won &apos;t be able to absorb it
the first time you see it .
eins ... zwei ... drei--
no good . okay .
you were right . i totally missed it .
i &apos;m glad that happened . i &apos;m actually glad that happened .
it &apos;s a good reminder , the dunphy tuck demands respect .
this ... time ... for ...
real !
jim mckay , that hurts !
i &apos;m gonna ... just adjust these springs .
they feel fine to me .
i &apos;m sure they do .
you don &apos;t have the foot sensitivity of a tramp champ .
if i ever had to read braille , i &apos;d--
oh , my god ! i think i did it !
did i do it ?
almost . yeah .
your , your form was a little off .
really ? it felt perfect . i &apos;ll try one more time .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s such a good idea .
you might cement in some bad ... habits .
i did it again !
i &apos;m gonna get you some water .
you seem lightheaded and delusional .
again !
oh , honey . you look exhausted .
well , i am not . i am as strong as ever .
certainly the strongest person in the house .
is luke doing the dunphy tuck ?
sort of a poor man &apos;s version of it .
he added a whole new twist .
it &apos;s called over @-@ rotation . look into it .
i was so caught up in my spring cleaning ,
it took me a while to see that phil was feeling inadequate .
i knew what i needed to do .
when you guys are done out there ,
do you think you could give luke my list ?
i have some chores on here that require some muscle .
maybe i should take care of that .
no , no , i @-@ i @-@ i can handle it .
luke &apos;s pretty busy out there not pointing his toes .
so he &apos;s all like , &quot; get a life , &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; no , thanks . got nine . &quot;
i mean , cause ...
sorry to interrupt , but i just took a break from painting .
wanted to come over , bring you some tea
and tell you to break a paw .
he almost broke his head .
yes , i know , and i feel horrible about that .
i @-@ i hope you know
i would never intentionally do anything to harm--
my throat !
it burns !
he made the tea too hot !
not on purpose !
he tripped on one of coach tucker &apos;s paint cans .
i don &apos;t remember leaving that there !
oh , look at me . i can &apos;t command a stage .
you , you have to take my place .
we &apos;ll wheel you out onto stage .
oh , come on , we both know
this song requires catlike movements .
someone get this man into fur and makeup !
what are you doing ? !
last item on the list--
move the table .
no . you should not be doing that alone .
really ? cause i got the fridge out to the curb .
how ?
drug it .
stand back . i &apos;m turtling her .
no , you &apos;re gonna get hurt , sweetie .
let me get luke . luke !
no , no , no !
i don &apos;t need his help !
let him play his precious banjo !
it was like the banjo was mocking me .
* you are not the man you used to be *
* you get up four times at night to pee *
* ba @-@ da @-@ dum ba bat da doot doot doo *
* you &apos;re super @-@ duper old now *
take five .
i don &apos;t know that one .
give me a couple minutes . i &apos;ll figure it out .
it &apos;s a little hard to get things done with all the noise .
what &apos;s that ?
nothing .
is that ...
a bra ?
you &apos;re not supposed to have girls up here .
i can explain .
you don &apos;t have to !
you think you &apos;re an adult , but you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re a kid living under my roof ,
and you have to obey my rules !
the &quot; g &quot; string snapped !
probably not the first time that &apos;s happened in here .
no ! it hit my eye !
is it bleeding ?
first of all , eyes can &apos;t bleed , so--
sammy davis jr . , that &apos;s bad !
alex !
i &apos;m looking for my sister .
she has brown hair ,
dressed like a nerd , but not ironically .
hang on !
hello ?
haley , are you with alex ?
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
uh , yeah , yeah .
we &apos;re just a tiny bit separated right now ,
but , uh , she &apos;s been acting a little strange .
oh , no . what do you mean ?
um , i -- well , i @-@ i &apos;d say she &apos;s been , um ...
a bit distant .
oh , no .
mom , don &apos;t freak out .
no , i was worried about this
when you two left this morning .
oh , okay , so she was being a little uptight .
come on ! open up , you stupid thing !
okay , fine ! she was a total buzzkill , okay !
i just wanted to relax her .
damn it .
i know , i know -- it was a mistake .
but it &apos;s not like i poured it down her throat !
she didn &apos;t get into harvard .
oh , thank god !
that &apos;s why she &apos;s been acting so weird .
wait . what do you mean ,
you didn &apos;t pour it down her throat ?
did you get her drunk ?
hey , you hacked her computer !
is that her ?
uh , i just found her .
i &apos;ll have her call you .
take me to my sister !
all right , lily &apos;s camp is just through those trees .
i &apos;ll be back soon .
take your time .
i got a couple of robustos to keep me company .
um , what &apos;s up with the outfit ?
it &apos;s to keep the smoke off me
so gloria won &apos;t smell it .
that &apos;s insane .
yep , i &apos;ve lost my mind .
have fun breaking your daughter out of sleepaway camp .
oh , of course you wouldn &apos;t understand .
why ?
you forgot ?
i forgot i shouldn &apos;t ask &quot; why &quot; to things .
i was 9 years old , at camp .
there were mosquitos , compost toilets ,
mean kids .
it was theater camp , wasn &apos;t it ?
naturally , you remember that part .
the point is , i hated it .
i was -- i was cold , and i was scared ,
especially
after this kid told this terrifying ghost story ,
so i snuck away to a pay phone ,
i called you , crying ,
and in a performance even more predictable
than todd jansen &apos;s artful dodger ,
you refused to pick me up .
for your own good .
learning to fend for yourself
is an important part of becoming a man .
before you claim that all my professional success
stems from your very , very brave decision
to stay at home on the couch
watching &quot; the bionic woman , &quot;
i am going to go get lily .
so that she knows she can always count on me .
it &apos;s fine .
if that &apos;s your idea of a dramatic exit ,
it &apos;s no wonder todd jansen got that part .
so , the doctor will see you in a few minutes .
nice someone can see .
glad to know your good eye can still roll .
so , still angry , huh ?
gee , why would i be angry ?
because you insulted me , maimed me , and belittled
my achievements in the banjonic and trampolinic arts ?
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not proud of my behavior today .
probably started with the 5k i ran yesterday .
10k .
for everyone else .
it was the first time in 15 years i couldn &apos;t finish .
then , today , it &apos;s everything i can do , you can do better .
no , i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s not your fault .
every dad goes through it --
the day he starts seeing his son as a man and not a boy .
it &apos;s a shock .
like when we first got high @-@ def tv
and i realized ed bradley had an earring .
i &apos;m not as much of a man as you think , dad .
oh , really ?
how come an hour ago ,
i had a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s bra in my hand ?
can we talk somewhere more private ?
the bra belongs to me .
oh ... kay .
that &apos;s not the conversation i thought we &apos;d be having ,
but ... if that &apos;s what you need on the outside
to feel like the luke you are on the inside --
no !
it &apos;s to practice on .
i stink at unhooking them .
last week , i tried to
take one off a girl at a party .
i fumbled for so long , she started to laugh .
it still haunts me .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t go away this week .
my trip wasn &apos;t canceled .
everyone found out and ...
i get it -- you couldn &apos;t face them .
listen , i know this part of your life
may not be moving fast enough for you ,
but enjoy it while it lasts .
someday , your life &apos;s gonna be moving faster than you want ,
and you could wind up doing something dumb ,
like blinding your son .
i &apos;m blind ? !
probably not .
luke dunphy ?
i know i &apos;m getting a little old for this place , but ...
i do like coming here .
oh , lukey !
you hurt your eye .
do you need a hug ?
a big one .
come here .
alex ! alex , stop !
i have been chasing you for , like , an hour !
where are you going ? !
this guy weasel said he knows
of some hot springs in the hills .
we were just gonna go try and find them .
oh , okay . so , we &apos;ll see you in , like , what , 10 years ,
when you spoon @-@ tunnel
your way out of weasel &apos;s basement ?
i know about harvard .
how ?
mom saw on your computer .
and of course she told you ,
because privacy doesn &apos;t mean anything .
why do things the right way ?
alex , i r--
no ! what &apos;s the point ?
get straight a &apos;s for 10 years ,
spend your summers building houses ,
drag your cello to school every day ,
write the perfect essay , and for what ? !
&quot; no , thank you , alex ! &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want you , alex ! &quot;
okay , you are drawing more attention to yourself
than the guy wearing a ferret as a scarf .
i don &apos;t care anymore !
i &apos;ve spent my entire life trying to be perfect ,
and where did it get me ?
i am in a field with 6,000 idiots !
know what ? i think that this is a good thing for you .
can you just spare me today ?
no .
you &apos;re obviously going to get into
one of those snooty schools ,
and sometimes you &apos;re gonna come in second ...
or fourth , or maybe even tenth .
but you &apos;re gonna dust yourself off ,
maybe put on some lipstick for once , and keep going .
i &apos;m allowed to feel bad about this , okay ?
look , you are a superstar !
i &apos;ve been saying since you were 10
you &apos;re gonna be on the supreme court .
thanks .
but for the record , i &apos;m gonna be a scientist .
lab coat , robe --
as long as something &apos;s covering up your outfit ,
you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
i ... don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i had killed with that song at three amateur productions ,
two gay weddings , and a two @-@ hour gate hold on a 747,
but i could tell the audience thought
that i had sabotaged kaplan to grab the spotlight ,
and my confidence caught in my throat
like a three @-@ day furball .
i couldn &apos;t have stunk up the place worse
if i &apos;d performed in a litter box .
thank you . thank you very much .
bravo , cameron .
can &apos;t talk ! i &apos;ll be in my stall !
so , now everybody hates cameron .
okay , look , i can &apos;t sing &quot; memory . &quot;
it &apos;s too much song for me .
so when i found out that coach tucker
wanted to sing it , as well , i had my out --
until he nobly stepped aside .
luckily , the sandbag fell , everyone blamed him ,
and i just saw my opening .
i put the paint cans on the floor
and pretended that the tea scalded me .
but to see him crash and burn on stage , that ...
it doesn &apos;t get better than that .
oh , it &apos;s about to ,
because i turned your microphone on ,
and everybody there is listening
to everything that you just said !
no . no ! no , no , no , no , no , no .
you monster !
amazing ! and with no commercials !
the worst thing about the woods
is you never know what you &apos;re gonna run into --
a bear , a hunter who doesn &apos;t take kindly to city folk ,
or worse ...
i can &apos;t wait . i love s &apos;mores .
... your daughter , as happy as you &apos;ve ever seen her .
the only thing to do was to sneak back to the car
and think of a lie to tell my dad along the way .
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know , but let &apos;s hit it with a shovel .
and stab it with our marshmallow sticks !
no ! no , no , no , no ! i @-@ i &apos;m lily &apos;s dad .
i &apos;m lily-- hi . she &apos;s mine .
what are you doing here ?
okay , i @-@ i thought you gave me the signal .
no ! go away .
you &apos;re embarrassing me in front of 8 @-@ year @-@ olds .
sorry .
i just finished telling the girls a ghost story .
it was so scary .
do you know any ?
i do know one from my own camp days ,
but it &apos;s probably too scary for you , s--
tell us now !
okay , okay .
it &apos;s really scary . don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
this better be good .
i @-@ it takes place at a camp a lot like this one ,
where just beyond the woods , there was a black lake .
and just beyond the lake , there was a prison .
this isn &apos;t scary .
okay , it was a haunted pr--
it was a haunted prison .
now , on this one night , the night of the full moon ,
what they call &quot; the blood moon ... &quot;
okay , what was at this prison was a -- was a ghost --
the ghost of an old man with glowing red eyes ,
who breathed fire !
i &apos;m bored . can we go to sleep early ?
i think you &apos;re forgetting about the blood moon .
what &apos;s that ? !
glowing eyes !
it &apos;s the ghost !
it &apos;s the ghost ! no !
girls !
thanks for that . bedtime should be a treat .
well , i guess you finally rescued me at camp .
better late than never .
by the way , i should &apos;ve
come by and picked you up from camp .
that , uh , &quot; tough it out &quot; stuff --
that was my dad talking .
he threw me in a lake once i was afraid of .
did i ever tell you about that story ?
yeah , yeah , we &apos;ve all heard that story .
now , don &apos;t feel too bad .
i was completely wrong about lily .
i almost rescued her from
having the time of her life .
oh , that &apos;s the way of things .
things work out , and someday ,
you &apos;ll be able to see her
be completely wrong about her kids .
it &apos;s fun .
oh . okay .
want a cigar ?
no . no , thank you .
you know , i -- i once stole one of those when i was a kid .
made me completely dizzy .
i don &apos;t remember the rest of the night .
aren &apos;t you going to that faculty follies after this ?
yeah . give me one of those .
i thought there was a step there .
oh , yeah , you &apos;ll get your depth perception back
once you get the bandages off .
careful in the middle , there .
i still haven &apos;t a chance to --
i know .
i thought you were alex .
she didn &apos;t get in .
oh , no !
stupid harvard .
&quot; stupid harvard &quot; ?
she didn &apos;t get into princeton , either ?
no , just harvard .
i thought that this might soften the blow .
and i made her her favorite dinner .
you &apos;re such a good mom .
there she is !
hi . i heard .
i &apos;m so sorry .
uh , thanks , mom ,
but haley already made me feel a little better about it .
i just don &apos;t really feel like talking right now .
i kind of just want to change my password and get into bed .
okay .
she just needs a little bit of time to work through it .
alone ?
the kids are growing up .
guess they don &apos;t need us as much anymore .
oh , well , that was the plan .
i just thought
it would feel better than this .
me too .
at least we still need each other .
and i get so lucky .
ok .
still got it !
