have a good day .
hey , if you need a place to stay ...
there &apos;s an old couch in my basement .
my mom will never know .
was there a second watch ? was anyone else keeping time ?
it was a tie , paige . you and emily tied .
you need to be home where you &apos;re safe .
you could chain me to this porch ,
and i &apos;d still never touch you like that again .
i just got off the phone with mrs. potter &apos;s housekeeper .
mrs. potter had a heart attack .
paige ?
i &apos;m sorry , emily .
i just wanted you to know that .
i think maybe you &apos;re being framed .
what changed your mind ?
i think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me .
so , this is what a real date with ezra fitz looks like .
lead the way .
i gave your mom the museum ticket .
why would you do that ?
让艾瑞亚她妈看到她女儿掩藏的事 -a
&quot; a &quot; has something on me .
&quot; a &quot; has something on all of us , hanna .
okay , your sister &apos;s pregnant . how &apos;d that happen ?
i figure pretty much the usual way .
it &apos;s not really a &quot; how &quot; question .
it &apos;s more of a &quot; why &quot; question .
well , i mean , i guess melissa could have gone all maternal ,
but i doubt it .
this is so creepy .
where are they now ?
philadelphia . shopping .
what do you think this means ?
i don &apos;t know , but toby wanted us to have it .
there .
it &apos;s in braille , so ...
you want to see this , aria ?
no .
i can see just fine from here .
okay .
the first letter is a &quot; b. &quot;
&quot; a. &quot; it &apos;s an &quot; a. &quot;
i think it &apos;s gonna tell us who &quot; a &quot; is .
&quot; d. &quot;
b @-@ a @-@ d.
&quot; bad . &quot;
that &apos;s the whole message ? &quot; bad ? &quot;
what &apos;s it supposed to mean ?
it means you got punked .
toby doesn &apos;t trust us . i don &apos;t blame him .
no , i don &apos;t think he &apos;d mess with us like this .
you &apos;d be surprised what people are capable of .
you guys , we have to figure this out .
this might be a joke , but it could be something real .
look , either way , toby &apos;s not the enemy .
you know what , guys ? i &apos;m gonna go .
what was that all about ?
how should i know ?
第一季 第十七集
doesn &apos;t look like very much .
well , it &apos;s all we have .
the rest is gone .
you know , mom , mrs. potter doesn &apos;t need that money anymore .
no , but we can &apos;t keep it .
no , not keep it ,
but i don &apos;t know , maybe we could
give it to somebody who needs it .
i love you for thinking that ,
but i just want this nightmare to be over .
i &apos;m putting the money back in the safe deposit box , what is left of it .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
all right .
bye , mom .
i left a wakeup call for nine .
do you want something to eat ?
you mean this is one of those basement breakfast places ?
i don &apos;t know how long we can keep doing this .
well , it won &apos;t be long .
you &apos;d go back to your foster parents ?
not a chance .
but i &apos;ve almost saved up enough to get out to arizona .
i have a friend in flagstaff .
you gonna miss me ?
well , it was nice knowing
when something goes bump in the night , it &apos;s you .
what have you got to be afraid of ?
forgot this .
honey ? put on gloves if you &apos;re gonna do the dishes .
right .
hey .
hey .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
last night after i left i felt awful .
i &apos;m sorry for what i did and--
and what almost happened .
i should have figured it out .
at least i should have listened to you .
yeah , well , it was terrible , but ...
all i could think about was my mom .
i &apos;m sorry . i was so mean .
well , i had it coming .
no .
i was thinking--
&quot; a &quot; could have given that ticket to my mom ,
but they made you do it
just to make it hurt more .
i want to say that it &apos;s all &quot; a &apos;s &quot; fault ,
but i &apos;m the one who gave your mom that ticket .
and i don &apos;t like knowing what i &apos;m capable of .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t go through with it .
okay ? that &apos;s the difference .
it was a silent auction ,
and a private book signing and coffee with the author .
i really liked his early work ,
that book about the teacher in newark .
so , do you want coffee with leonard adams
and an autographed book ?
count me in .
what was the name of the newark book ?
loose leaf .
that was good , wasn &apos;t it ?
well , why don &apos;t you come with us , ella ?
how many people can you bring ?
as--as many as i want .
well , come with us , ella .
all right , i will .
you know , aria might be right about this .
toby does have every reason to give us a hard time .
i suppose , but that &apos;s just not the feeling
that i got from talking to him .
do you know what i mean ?
yeah , i do .
what is with you and the artful dodger ?
who ?
caleb .
i thought that thing at the swim meet was a one @-@ off .
it was .
we just saw you talking to him .
and you gave him something that looked like a wet oven mitt .
it was his hat .
what are you doing with his hat ?
why shouldn &apos;t i have his hat ?
hanna , maybe you &apos;re looking
for something a little edgier after sean .
but this guy is dark .
spencer , he &apos;s not that dark .
he &apos;s dark enough .
well , he &apos;s no arthur dodger , whoever that is .
yeah , he &apos;s just had it tough .
are you two on speaking terms again ?
of course we are .
you need to be really careful about that guy .
well , it seems to me we had this conversation once about toby .
i &apos;m looking for coach walton .
is the coach expecting you ?
the coach is avoiding me . that &apos;s what the coach is doing .
are you a parent ?
yes , i &apos;m a parent . nick mccullers .
my daughter is paige mccullers .
i have your daughter in english comp .
i &apos;m ezra fitz .
the coach .
tell you what , why don &apos;t we walk down to the principal &apos;s office
and see if we can &apos;t find coach walton ?
actually , i &apos;ve seen the principal , and all i got
was a lot of politically correct double @-@ talk
about the agenda in this place that &apos;s penalizing my daughter ,
taking opportunities away from her
and giving them to someone who doesn &apos;t deserve them !
everybody gets a fair chance here , mr. mccullers .
we go out of our way to make sure that that &apos;s how it works .
my girl is the best swimmer on that team ,
and you can &apos;t give it to somebody just because--
yor &apos;re in a cafeteria , mr. mccullers ,
filled with kids trying to have lunch .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the audience you want , is it ?
hello , mrs. marin . i &apos;m james lehand .
have a seat , mr. leland .
i &apos;m sorry , my regular assistant didn &apos;t make your appointment .
all i know is , you need to speak to an officer .
i &apos;m esther potter &apos;s nephew .
she died recently .
yes , i &apos;m sorry . she was a loyal customer .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about her accounts ,
her safety deposit box .
um ... actually ,
we were under the impression
mrs. potter had no living relatives .
she certainly was the last of the potters .
but her sister married my grandfather
up in syracuse , where i &apos;m from .
i think technically that makes me a great @-@ nephew .
yes .
well , the state revenue agency will need to see your i.d.
before i can release any information
or give you access to the safe deposit box .
i thought so .
i brought copies .
oh ... good .
leland &amp; daley ?
yes , we &apos;re architects .
i will get these to the revenue agency .
it &apos;s a little late in the day to expect a response .
i have business in the area .
i &apos;m here for a few days .
my cell number &apos;s on there .
of course .
were you and your aunt ... close ?
for most of my life ,
she was a birthday card with a $ 5 bill in it .
but she never missed a birthday .
i understand .
how about you ? how well did you know my aunt ?
my great @-@ aunt .
she came in once a year ,
like santa claus .
she was very sweet .
when i called , they told me
that you had spoken to her just before she died .
i &apos;d like to know what you thought of her .
i don &apos;t know what i could tell you .
we could talk about it over drinks .
i don &apos;t know .
consider it . you &apos;ve got the number .
i will get these to the revenue office .
thank you .
listen , i didn &apos;t know my dad was coming .
he wanted to know how somebody could beat me .
he wanted to know if i slacked off , but i didn &apos;t .
you know i didn &apos;t .
i told him we tied but you got the slot .
because i &apos;m gay ?
no .
i didn &apos;t say anything . he must have asked around .
but i didn &apos;t tell him . i swear .
i have to go to class .
so you can &apos;t make it to any of
the teacher conferences ?
no . i can do them .
i just need to reschedule them for tomorrow .
you don &apos;t have to see all of them .
you should meet her french teacher , mr. carinci ,
and ... oh , are you going to meet ezra ?
ezra ?
ezra fitz , her english teacher .
aria &apos;s crazy about him ,
and i can see why .
he &apos;s very smart , he &apos;s attractive , sensitive .
does he also play guitar ?
uh , not that i know of ,
but he does know how to handle a loose cannon .
today nick mccullers showed up .
mccullers . from the library board ?
the same one , with the very same paranoia .
he was about to launch into the gay agenda
right there in the cafeteria .
ezra totally calmed the waters ,
completely defused the situation .
it was something to see .
hmm . well , i &apos;m sorry i missed that .
you should meet him . you &apos;ll like him .
i &apos;m late .
listen , ella .
i thought maybe we could just pick up from where we left off .
maybe next friday ?
sure .
uh , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m actually
going to a book signing with ezra . leonard adams .
a @-@ adams ? i thought you hated adams .
i liked his early stuff . rain check ?
yeah , rain check .
toby ?
can i talk to you a second ?
i can &apos;t talk .
something &apos;s up with the d.a.
the lawyer &apos;s driving me over to my dad &apos;s office .
just tell me-- was that supposed to be a joke ?
were you just trying to get back at me ? because if you were--
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m talking about what i found in my book .
the braille that you wanted me to have .
that was no joke .
&quot; bad &quot; ?
the whole message was &quot; bad . &quot; what does that mean ?
am i supposed to go buy an old michael jackson album ?
you &apos;re reading it wrong .
i can &apos;t do this now . come back saturday in the morning .
jenna is out at her flute lesson .
i think you &apos;re taking a big chance with this guy .
i am a very good judge of character .
is that why you fixed aria up with an old con ?
an old con who had everyone fooled .
maybe caleb is the same .
it &apos;s ... only hanna .
i wasn &apos;t asking you who you were on the phone with .
do you want the last bit of cobbler ?
i can bring it up for you .
no , thanks .
okay .
what do you mean , &quot; only hanna ? &quot;
it &apos;s my mom .
things are still sub @-@ zero around here .
did you tell her about paige &apos;s dad coming to school ?
no point . she &apos;ll say it &apos;s my fault
for choosing a disgusting lifestyle .
paige is such a nob .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s all her fault .
what do you mean ?
what &apos;s going on between you and aria ?
it &apos;s nothing you have to worry about .
you were snarking at each other
like you were on a reality show .
&quot; the real teens of rosewood . &quot;
oh , tell me about toby .
he says we have what he wanted us to have .
it &apos;s the right message ,
i &apos;m just reading it wrong .
he wants me to come to his house saturday .
are you going ?
if i don &apos;t , how are we gonna figure this out ?
i &apos;m shut out with melissa and ian .
where are you ?
what do you mean ? i &apos;m right here .
any fire truck you can hear at your house i can hear at mine .
oh , my god ! are you in his apartment ?
are you on the bed ?
no . i &apos;m not on the bed .
is he there ?
n @-@ not exactly .
is he taking a shower ?
he &apos;s getting take @-@ out for dinner .
and this call &apos;s becoming very 1 @-@ 900 .
&quot; to talk to a hot english teacher , press 3 . &quot;
call ending now .
tomorrow ?
yeah , tomorrow .
hey .
hi there .
sorry it took so long .
it &apos;s okay .
looks like rose of sharon has been discovered .
big crowd at the take @-@ out counter .
i meet your dad tomorrow .
i know .
i was thinking this is gonna be a bit more complex
than the usual parent @-@ teacher discussion .
i mean , i can see your mom &apos;s a colleague , she &apos;s safe .
but your dad is your dad , which is complex .
you will like him , he &apos;ll like you .
just be your normal incredible self .
what is he after ?
he &apos;s probably just what he says he is ,
a nephew cleaning up after a distant relative .
&quot; probably &quot; ?
i &apos;ll know more after the second martini .
hello .
caleb . wow .
hello , mrs. marin .
hanna thought it was about time you and me met .
i did ?
i did . um ... mom , this is caleb .
rivers .
nice to meet you , caleb .
mrs. marin , you have a lovely home
from what i &apos;ve seen of it .
caleb is new to rosewood this year .
they brought me in to class the place up .
i see .
hanna , can i talk to you for a second ?
is he some sort of rebound from sean ?
what ? ! no .
i don &apos;t want you alone with him in the house .
go out . if you &apos;re gonna study , go to the library .
you let me study here with sean .
well , i knew sean . sean was a minister &apos;s son .
sean called you &quot; hanna banana . &quot;
i &apos;ll get that for you .
hi .
hello . i &apos;m looking for mrs. marin .
come on in .
she &apos;s in the kitchen with hanna .
hanna ?
her daughter .
are you her son ?
no . i &apos;m just the guy who opens the door .
mr. leland ,
this is my daughter hanna .
hello .
hello , hanna .
oh , i forgot to get your signature on this .
it &apos;s just part of authorizing you
to look at the safety deposit box .
sure .
thank you .
okay .
i won &apos;t be late .
okay .
what are you doing ?
coming to the front door like that ?
i thought it was a better way to meet your mom
than her tripping over me behind the furnace .
yeah , but just knocking on the door ?
why couldn &apos;t you ask me ?
you would have said no ?
my mom thinks you &apos;re trouble .
and you don &apos;t like her new boyfriend .
he &apos;s not her boyfriend . he &apos;s a customer at the bank .
some architect from syracuse .
really .
what do you mean &quot; really &quot; ?
he had a crappy plastic pen .
so ?
so , architects draw for a living .
they tend to be pen snobs ,
strictly mont blanc and beyond .
why does he creep you out ?
he doesn &apos;t creep me out .
yes , he does . you get a bad vibe from the guy .
it &apos;s complicated .
tell me .
i like complicated .
aria does a great deal of independent reading .
you can see she &apos;s excited by the idea of fiction .
it &apos;s one of the things that makes her such a good student .
so you &apos;re taking my wife out .
uh--sorry ?
well , you &apos;re going out with my wife
to some book event ?
right , right . the book signing next week .
it &apos;s an event for an author we both like , leonard adams .
leonard adams . do you--
do you think he &apos;s good ?
i like some of his stuff very much .
ella &apos;s a fan , too .
well , i think he &apos;s a fake , very overrated .
he has his critics .
he certainly wouldn &apos;t fit in to
what i &apos;m trying to do with aria &apos;s class .
is he really your idea of a good writer ?
well--i like a lot of writers
for a lot of different reasons .
yeah . ella used to hate him .
i mean , i can remember she
threw his latest novel clear across our bedroom .
she was so angry .
but , uh , look at you . you &apos;ve turned her around .
how &apos;d you manage to do that ?
a silent auction .
for charity .
when are you supposed to see toby ?
tomorrow , while jenna &apos;s at her music lesson .
take it .
no .
no , you take it .
the storm has passed .
what was going on with you two ?
okay , so , you know how i went to that museum with ezra ?
well , &quot; a &quot; tried to get hanna to ruin it .
ruin it how ?
&quot; a &quot; gave me another ticket
and made me give it to aria &apos;s mom .
god ! hanna , why didn &apos;t you tell us what was happening ?
well , i tried to stop it .
i mean , her mom &apos;s car didn &apos;t just stall .
caleb fixed it to keep from getting there ,
and that &apos;s why i owe him .
yeah , and he &apos;s the one who &apos;s
been breaking into vending machines at school .
i mean , he &apos;s practically living there .
in school ?
they found his stuff ,
so he &apos;s not sleeping there anymore .
he &apos;s sleeping in my basement .
wait . rewind that a little for me .
does your mom know ?
no , but--
it &apos;s just for a couple of nights , so ...
a couple of nights ?
are you crazy ?
guys .
oh , wow . hold on . turn around .
it fits perfectly .
let me just pull this over it .
and you know the length . the length looks great .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i want it to be perfect .
he likes lace .
i &apos;m not misinterpreting .
i &apos;m telling you , your dad came in there
like he wanted to chop me off at the knees .
and i &apos;m telling you that &apos;s not my dad .
i recognized him from the picture
you showed me of everybody on the glacier .
i &apos;m serious .
so am i.
i &apos;m trying to act like i &apos;m not in love with his daughter ,
and he &apos;s acting like he wants to challenge me to a duel
over your mother .
i don &apos;t understand .
i do .
he hates me .
he doesn &apos;t hate you .
he hates me , or he &apos;s crazy .
no , he does not hate you . he couldn &apos;t .
then he &apos;s crazy .
pam .
oh , hey , ella . how are you ?
i &apos;m okay . i was gonna call you .
but then i saw you were coming in for the parent @-@ teacher conferences .
i just want you to know that the school
is not gonna be bullied by nick mccullers .
everybody here loves emily .
what about nick mccullers ?
uh , well , he came in making a big deal
about how he thinks emily &apos;s
getting special treatment because she &apos;s gay .
everybody knows emily &apos;s the better swimmer ,
except mccullers .
he came here to school and said that ?
in front of everyone . students , teachers .
was emily there ?
she was .
hello ?
hello ?
you better put that back .
put it back where you got it or she &apos;ll know you were in here .
i &apos;m sorry . i knocked . the door was open .
i heard you , but i couldn &apos;t answer the door .
i was on the phone .
my lawyer called .
the d.a. is dropping the charges against me .
they &apos;re not gonna charge you with killing alison ?
i didn &apos;t get the details ,
but he said the blood evidence was corrupted .
the district attorney can &apos;t go to trial without it .
they &apos;re finished with you ?
not finished .
they can charge me anytime they find new evidence . but ...
for right now , i &apos;m free ,
once i get this ball and chain off my leg .
i &apos;m waiting for my dad to take me to the courthouse for that .
i could drive you ,
if you want me to .
so , your mom didn &apos;t believe you
when you said leland was shady .
you don &apos;t sound very surprised .
i &apos;m used to that ,
that &apos;s why i called syracuse university ,
talked to a nice lady at the school of architecture
about how i was thinking of applying
and did she know a local guy
named james leland .
you just called up and asked ?
people love to talk .
and guess what ?
james leland went to s.u. and opened an office in town .
see ? he &apos;s legit .
yeah , he was a pretty good architect ,
right up until he dropped dead two years ago .
introducing james leland .
wait . my mom said his i.d. checked out .
right . you ask a computer
&quot; is james leland related to this potter lady ? &quot;
the computer says yes .
but you didn &apos;t ask if james leland was still alive .
knowing the right questions
is better than having all the right answers .
toby ?
mr. dugan called with the good news . did you hear ?
he told me .
we can get that awful thing off your leg right now .
the cab &apos;s waiting .
that &apos;s all right . i &apos;ve got a ride .
emily .
no , it &apos;s me .
spencer .
it &apos;s really very nice of you , but i &apos;m here now .
i &apos;m going with spencer .
i see .
hanna , the man &apos;s i.d. checked out .
it checked out because there was a
james leland related to mrs. potter .
but this isn &apos;t him . this is somebody else .
if i tell the state people
some story about the man being an imposter ,
it &apos;ll just draw attention , which we do not want .
well , we have to do something .
i &apos;m not doing anything based on what this boy caleb says .
leland &apos;s coming to the bank this afternoon ,
i will show him the safe deposit box .
and we will go from there .
all right , well , call me when he leaves .
i will .
hey . i thought you were gonna be gone all day .
uh , change of plans .
good . i &apos;ll take you and mike out for dinner later . okay ?
hey , dad ?
how were the parent @-@ teacher meetings ?
oh , they were fine .
you know , i really like that one teacher , your french teacher .
well , how do you like mr. fitz ?
he was okay .
&quot; okay &quot; ?
all right , listen , i &apos;m gonna tell you the truth .
i thought he was a lightweight .
what do you mean ?
well , there &apos;s just not a lot of depth there .
boy , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s funny ,
&apos;cause i like him . he &apos;s a good teacher .
well , i can see why he &apos;s a hit with the kids ,
i mean , he &apos;s a nice @-@ looking guy , he &apos;s easygoing .
he does that boyish smile thing a little too much ,
but i figure that must work for him .
what &apos;s that thing about judging a book by its cover ?
well , sometimes you can get a pretty good idea
what &apos;s inside based on the cover .
well , you know , he &apos;s published .
online journals aren &apos;t &quot; published . &quot;
&quot; published &quot; is ink and paper .
well , you were with him like , what , half an hour ?
i &apos;m in his class every day .
well , every english department has one ,
full of charm and promise . it &apos;s--
look , i understand that you--
and your mother-- see more of him than i do ,
but perhaps that &apos;s why i have a clearer perspective .
what &apos;s mom have to do with this ?
well , she &apos;s not immune to that kind of charm .
this book signing thing he &apos;s taking her to ...
that &apos;s not just mom . half of the teachers
in the english department are going .
well ...
listen , when mike comes home , we &apos;ll pick a place for dinner .
three thousand dollars ?
three thousand , two hundred seventy @-@ five .
it &apos;s funny ...
you don &apos;t have expectations ,
and then you end up having expectations .
the family myth was that
aunt esther had a lot of cash socked away somewhere .
a lot more than three thousand .
the bank doesn &apos;t encourage people to keep cash
in safe deposit boxes .
so , she spoke to you about keeping money in here ?
no . we never talked about it .
who else besides you would have access to this box ?
any officer .
of course , you &apos;d have to have the customer &apos;s key ,
or the master , like i used .
what are you thinking ?
just thinking .
where do you bank , james ?
in syracuse ?
where do i bank ?
your personal accounts , business accounts .
what &apos;s the name of your bank ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the rules on access are the same , industry @-@ wide .
call them and ask ?
they have saturday hours , don &apos;t they ?
like i said , it was just a family myth .
great meet , guys .
way to go , sharks .
come here .
i don &apos;t need a ride . my car is in the parking lot .
no , i need to ask you a question .
i need to know something before i talk to the school .
talk to the school about what ?
is it true what aria &apos;s mom told me
about mr. mccullers coming to the school
and saying you got some kind of preferential treatment ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
emily , is it true ?
i mean , is this true ? because--
yeah , it &apos;s true .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you really don &apos;t know why i wouldn &apos;t tell you ?
it &apos;s because i know what you think of me .
i know what you &apos;d say .
it doesn &apos;t matter who i am ,
i better get used to people looking at me only one way .
nick .
hello , pam .
we need to talk .
i was wondering when i &apos;d hear from you .
this isn &apos;t personal .
you deal with your family problems any way that you want .
this is about what the school is doing to my daughter .
yeah . it &apos;s about your daughter .
it &apos;s about you trying to
make her into some kind of professional victim
and using my daughter to do it .
i didn &apos;t expect you to understand .
oh , i understand .
i understand that you always thinks there &apos;s someone else to blame
when things don &apos;t go your way .
okay , you &apos;re upset .
no , not yet .
but i &apos;m getting there .
my daughter never got anything she didn &apos;t earn .
that &apos;s how we raised her . that it who she is .
so you drop this , nick .
drop it , or i &apos;ll show you what a real agenda looks like .
mom . are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . come on , i &apos;ll take you home .
my car &apos;s in the lot .
right , ok . so i &apos;ll just meet you at home when you get there .
mom ...
emily--
i still don &apos;t understand ...
but i love you .
you are my child , and nobody hurts my child .
i &apos;m so sorry if i ...
you could just keep going .
if that &apos;s what you wanted .
they could pull me back whenever they want .
anyway ... i don &apos;t like running .
i &apos;ve done too much of it .
you could start to get your life back .
i &apos;m not so sure i want it back .
not the way it was . i have to make some changes .
i figured out what the message means .
braille uses the same symbols for letters and numbers .
it wasn &apos;t b @-@ a @-@ d , it was the number 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 .
what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
toby .
i heard jenna in her room
on the phone talking to somebody .
i don &apos;t know who . they were talking about you .
talking about me ?
jenny used the embosser attached to her computer ,
and i slipped in and made a rubbing of what she printed out .
two @-@ one @-@ four .
does that number mean anything to you ?
it could be anything .
a house number , an area code--
we have to figure it out , for both our sakes .
are you afraid of jenna ?
i was .
i still have to be careful not to cross her .
she &apos;s got the power in that house .
but ...
i &apos;m not afraid of her the way i used to be .
that makes her nervous .
you make her nervous .
i do ?
i think she &apos;s afraid of you ,
and the rest of alison &apos;s friends--
all of you who were there the night of the fire .
listen , it &apos;s like your mom said ,
my dad is always looking for somebody to blame .
i have to go home . my mom &apos;s waiting for me .
right . your mom &apos;s waiting .
god , why is everything
so easy for you ?
easy ? what planet do you live on ?
i &apos;ve spent most of my life trying not to feel the way i feel .
i come out , and they ship
my first girlfriend off to god @-@ knows @-@ where ,
and now maybe she &apos;s done with me .
so , yeah , it &apos;s all about emily-- all em , all the time .
don &apos;t tell .
hey , not all of it . my mom will notice .
tell her it &apos;s evaporation .
walk me home ?
uh , so maybe your mom will let me hang around on the surface now ?
and i thought you were in such a hurry to get to arizona .
arizona will be there whenever i decide to show up .
thank you for today .
you &apos;re welcome .
are you &quot; a &quot; ?
excuse me ?
somebody called for an estimate .
said you had some kind of infestation in your basement .
only name they left was &quot; a. &quot; is that you ?
uh , no . you have the wrong house .
mr. fitz , this is byron montgomery ,
aria &apos;s dad .
look , i &apos;m sorry about how our meeting went .
i owe you a make @-@ good on that .
i &apos;ve read your stories and i &apos;d like to talk to you .
so maybe we could have a beer ?
