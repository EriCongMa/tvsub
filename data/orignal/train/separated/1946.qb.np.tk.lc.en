&quot; how to save a life &quot;
when i was five ,
my mom lost me in a park .
i don &apos;t remember much .
except that one minute i was riding the carousel ,
and the next ...
she was gone .
i &apos;ll be home before you know it .
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s time .
i don &apos;t know , i just feel like i just got you back ,
and now we &apos;re going again and i @-@ i just have to stay here .

all i remember is what happened next .
she told me not to worry .
she told me everything would be fine .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .

the things you can &apos;t quite remember ...
and the things you can never forget .

listen . getting you out ? it &apos;s going to hurt . a lot .
okay . i know that i should be in pain ,
and , um , i don &apos;t know i @-@ if it &apos;s shock
or if it &apos;s that my leg hurts so badly
that i almost can &apos;t recognize it .
almost feels normal ,
so maybe it won &apos;t be so bad getting me out .
sounds like you dislocated your hip .
which means i got to get you out of this car .
ohh ! okay .
down on the ground ,
and then pop it back in the socket .
okay . all right .
all right , i &apos;m not gonna sugarcoat it .
it &apos;s gonna be horrible .

someone &apos;s gonna see it ,
and then that someone is gonna send some help .
it &apos;s like a smoke signal .
we &apos;re so rescued .
i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
okay , we just need to hang on for a little bit longer .
is everybody okay ?
i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
i &apos;m a mathlete . i take five a.p. classes .
i &apos;m first chair on cello .
i have a perfect attendance record .
i haven &apos;t missed one day -- not one day of school .
i &apos;m boring .
charlie abbott &apos;s prom king .
he &apos;s in remedial math .
he &apos;s never even heard of a.p.
he &apos;s dumb and popular and totally gorgeous .
and this morning , he says , &quot; you want to go for a ride ? &quot; to me .
so , the earth is shifting on its axis or something crazy
because no way .
charlie abbott is not supposed to kiss me .
mm , so something is wrong .
some wormhole to another universe has opened .
i don &apos;t know , but now i am on a road
because the car i was in just flew through the air
and i just ran from a giant fireball
and charlie abbott &apos;s brain is broken
and my stomach is killing me .
so i am obviously not supposed to be here .
so , can someone please wake me up
or wave your magic wand or click your heels three times
or whatever so i can go home ?
please .
please . what ? what is it ?
just look at my eyes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
look at my face . look at my eyes , okay ?
i &apos;m scared .
okay , okay , just look at me .
derek ?
okay , we need to get her down on the ground . help me , okay ?
just come with me right now .
okay .
easy , easy .
i just need to undo a button
so i can look at your stomach , okay ?
i &apos;m scared .
i know .
i &apos;m not gonna go anywhere . i &apos;m here , okay ? look at me .
look at me . look at me in the eyes .
all right , i &apos;m gonna open up your pants
so i can just see your stomach , okay ?
i just want to take a quick look .
i &apos;m gonna take a look .
ohh , god !
sarah .
derek .
what &apos;s wrong with me ? is it my stomach ?
is it bleeding ?
it &apos;s okay .
am i dying ?
no , no , no .
i want to know .
you have a little cut in your tummy . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
it &apos;s no big deal . i can take care of it .
how ?
how are you gonna fix it ?
you don &apos;t know .
oh , my god , i &apos;m gonna die out here .
can you stop saying that ?
it &apos;s insulting . i don &apos;t let people die .
i &apos;m very good at my job ,
even next to the roadside , okay ?
i &apos;m thinking .
i &apos;m thinking .
sarah .
you have dry @-@ cleaning in the car , right , sarah ?
yeah , i think so .
so , charlie kissed you this morning .
was that your first kiss ?
yes . except for the guy who plays second @-@ chair cello .
he doesn &apos;t count .
why ?
it was just practice kissing .
so , should i be practicing ?
no . - yeah , but she just --
but how much trouble do you think she &apos;s gonna be in
when her mother finds out what she &apos;s been up to today ?
she has a point .
i &apos;m not your role model .
i don &apos;t think kissing charlie was worth all this .
every kiss before the right kiss doesn &apos;t count anyway .
i &apos;ve kissed a lot of women .
the first time i kissed my wife , well ...
i mean , she wasn &apos;t my wife then .
she was just this girl in a bar .
and when we kissed , it -- it was like ...
i got to tell you , it was like
i never kissed any other woman before .
it was like the first kiss .
the right kiss .
do you have a brother ?
it &apos;s a beautiful day to save lives .
what -- what does that mean ?
oh , it &apos;s just a thing i say .
do you hear that ?
hear what ?
hear that ?
they got our smoke signal !
yeah , they got our smoke signal .
they got us !
i &apos;ll visit you first thing in the morning at the hospital , okay ?
thank you .
okay , watch your step .
thank you .
got to hand it to you , doc .
now go home and have yourself a drink . you earned it .
thanks .
she told me not to worry .
she told me everything would be fine .
funny , isn &apos;t it , the way memory works ?
the things you can &apos;t quite remember ...
and the things you can never forget .
what do we have ?
where should i start ?
a bad one . jerome davis .
blunt @-@ force trauma , open skull fracture .
he keeps trying to die on us .
let &apos;s get him inside .
let &apos;s go .
no , no , no , wait .
what , no ! another one ? !
no , no , no , no , no .
we &apos;ve already got that -- that lady and her kid ,
the -- the girl with the guts ,
and then that dude with the head injury .
when it rains , it pours .
okay , it needs to pour somewhere else
because we are not a trauma center .
we &apos;re not properly equipped for this kind of thing .
we don &apos;t have rooms . you guys know that .
make room .
what are we supposed to do with the guy ?

look at the ultrasound .
he &apos;s bleeding into his belly .
we don &apos;t have time for a c.t.
arrogant --
because she &apos;s younger than you

i just think that -- - we don &apos;t have time for a c.t.
he needs to go straight to the o.r.
you have this . come on . don &apos;t back down .
i don &apos;t think we have a handle on --
his gcs hasn &apos;t changed since he got here .
the c.t. can wait .

he fixed her leg , he helped charlie ,
and he put alana &apos;s insides back in .
he saved us .

he &apos;s a surgeon .
let &apos;s get a ...

you need to wait .
sux and etomidate in ?
yes .

this isn &apos;t right .
you should have taken me to get a head c.t.
his pressure &apos;s holding .
maybe we should get the scan .
yes , listen to her .
too risky . he could bottom out in the scanner .
we need to open him up .
find the source of the bleeding .
no , you don &apos;t . you have the time .
we have to work fast , people .
i &apos;m stable .
guys , i &apos;m stable .

start him on pressors . betadine .
i can &apos;t feel my arm .
what is happening ?
ready to put him under .

he &apos;s got a grade @-@ 2 splenic lac .
meredith would leave it .

the neurosurgeon was at a dinner .
dinner ?
dinner ?
he said he &apos;ll be here in 20 minutes .
it will be too late .
damn it .
where the hell is he ?
page him again .
thank god .
what the hell have you people screwed up now ?
us ?
you &apos;re on call for trauma . what took you so long ?
who the hell are you ?
your response time was supposed to be 20 minutes .
it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference .
if you guys had ordered a head c.t. ,
you would have called me sooner .
what am i supposed to do about that ?
we needed to control .
he was bleeding into his belly .
he was stable .
you had the time .
now i &apos;ve got to work like hell to save this man , thanks to you .
there &apos;s no point .
you were supposed to be here in 20 minutes ,
not an hour and a half .
we had a chance . he had a freaking chance .
get out of my o.r.
what ?
you heard me .
unless you &apos;re gonna be cutting into this man &apos;s head ,
you can get out .
now .
now !
i &apos;m gonna scrub in .
someone pull in the craniotomy tray .
we &apos;ve already wasted enough time .
it &apos;s too late .
you &apos;re too late .
what did you do ?
oh , i did what i always do ,
except i almost killed myself doing it .
don &apos;t make jokes .
i was scared .
no , don &apos;t be scared .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
come here .
i &apos;m right here .
ma &apos;am ?
ma &apos;am ?
ma &apos;am , is this the home of derek shepherd ?
it is . he &apos;s my husband .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been an accident .
could you come with us , please ?
are you okay ?
i c-- i @-@ i can &apos;t just go .
i -- what am i supposed to do with my kids ?
blood . it &apos;s just blood .
meredith , don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be afrai ...
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
my mommy tried to kill herself .
dr. grey .
dr. grey , i can &apos;t ...
we can &apos;t tell you how sorry ...
i am so sorry for your loss .
dr. shepherd was a tremendous surgeon --
t @-@ tremendously gifted .
i &apos;ve long admired his techniques .
i ...
it ... was an honor .
the call to not get a head c.t. was a bad call .
we &apos;re not a trauma center .
we &apos;re a teaching hospital .
you did the best you could .
ma &apos;am ?
i thought that if this was a good time ,
i might take a moment to explain how this all works .
where are the papers ?
mrs. shepherd , there &apos;s some things you need to know --
some things we need to discuss .
difficult things .
i &apos;m a doctor . dr. grey .
i &apos;m a surgeon , just like my husband was .
i know how this works .
you &apos;ve waited the requisite number of hours ,
and now you can officially declare him dead .
normally , you &apos;d talk to me about organ donation .
but by the looks of his chart ,
there &apos;s not much left that works to donate .
so , the i.c.u. needs a bed .
those must be the papers --
the papers you want me to sign
to decide what to do with my husband ...
now that he &apos;s dead , but not really dead .
do we ship him off to a long @-@ term @-@ care facility
and cross our fingers and hope for fairy tales and magic ?
or do i pull the plug ?
and stop all curative intervention ?
discontinue all routine monitoring ,
remove all the catheters , drains , and tubes ,
end any and all treatments
that might provide comfort to the patient .
terminate all ...
life @-@ sustaining measures ...
... and behave as any sane doctor would behave .
does that about cover it , doctor ?
is that what you want to talk to me about ...
while i sit here with my sleeping children ?
you want to talk about killing my husband ?
give me the papers .
ma &apos;am --
give me the papers !
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know that that &apos;s useless to you right now .
but i am .
he saved all those people .
and it was my job ... to save him .
and i failed .
and now ... he &apos;s gonna die ...
because i was not a good enough doctor ...
... to keep him alive .
yeah , you &apos;re right . you did fail .
you weren &apos;t good enough .
but do you know what tomorrow is ?
it &apos;s friday .
there &apos;s gonna be more patients who come in
who need you to save them --
someone &apos;s mother , someone &apos;s kid , someone &apos;s husband .
they need you to save them
because they can &apos;t save themselves .
so learn from this , better yourself ,
and you will be better for next time .
what if i &apos;m not ?
you will be .
how can you know that ?
because he was your one .
every patient you treat ,
you &apos;re going to see my husband &apos;s face
and remember that he was the one that died on your watch .
he will haunt you . the hard ones always do .
and it only takes that one .
but that one will make you work harder ,
and they make you better .
