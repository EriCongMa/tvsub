第六季 第七集
kalinda sharma works closely on mr. agos &apos; cases ,
as well as being a social acquaintance .
but my report advises that the court &apos;s rulings are paramount .
asa polmar , you agree with these added restrictions ?
we do , your honor .
all right , then the bail is approved
but only with these further restrictions applying .
and if you break the rules again , young man ,
your bail will be revoked ,
and you will spend the remainder of your time before trial behind bars .
your honor , we ask for an extension in the speedy trial provision .
no . your honor ,
it is my client &apos;s constitutional right to a speedy trial .
yes , and if your client hadn &apos;t had some involvement
in the disappearance of our key witness ...
he had nothing to do with that disappearance .
he has flaunted the dictates of his bail ,
your honor , again and again .
wait , wait , wait . shut up .
now , how many days until trial ?
58 , your honor , as required by the speedy trial provision .
and how many more days do you need beyond that ?
your honor , my client &apos;s reputation ...
damn it , counselor !
will everybody , everybody just answer what i ask . okay ?
how long an extension ?
60 more days .
that will give us time to locate the missing witness , trey wagner .
if he &apos;s alive .
yes , if he &apos;s still alive .
finding trey wagner ? that &apos;s a hail mary pass .
on that i agree .
unfortunately , mr. polmar , i &apos;m gonna deny your motion ,
and the trial will begin on schedule in 58 days .
damn it .
so i heard-- no extension ?
yeah .
what &apos;s your plan ?
i &apos;m formulating a plan .
formulate it faster .
let me do my job .
cary was a good prosecutor .
he just wasn &apos;t ready for being deputy .
so did he resign willingly , or was he pressured ?
mr. agos resigned for &quot; fraternizing with a coworker . &quot;
come on , geneva , the longer that i work here ,
the more i realize there &apos;s always a reason behind the reason .
cary was gone for a few weeks on administrative leave .
i never got the whole story .
everybody guessed it contributed to his resignation .
when was this ?
three years ago .
and so you &apos;re the one who complained about cary ?
no , i just don &apos;t want my partner
to get blamed for missing evidence .
cary lost evidence ?
all i know is the chain of custody was intact
between us and the deputy sa .
we had a call from the crime lab asking where the evidence was .
where what was ? what was the evidence ?
cocaine .
two kilos .
it never showed up at my lab .
cary said that he delivered the cocaine to you .
to the lab , yeah , but there was no record .
and he never signed it out of the evidence room ,
which made it all very suspicious .
why wasn &apos;t there a bigger investigation ?
nobody wanted to point out deficiencies in the office .
especially when it had to do with the bishop case .
this is about bishop ?
yeah . we never could prove it
&apos;cause the evidence went missing .
thanks .
good day , huh ?
actually , pretty good .
you ?
well , i &apos;m learning how to campaign .
it &apos;s like learning a new language .
well , you got castro worried .
he is not a happy boy these days .
yeah , we &apos;re up by eight points ,
but i don &apos;t know how long that &apos;ll last .
you know when something good happens to you , but ...
it means something bad is gonna happen to someone else ?
i think so . why ?
come with me .
cary is in trouble .
i know .
worse trouble .
okay . how ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
but it could hurt you , the campaign .
you have to isolate yourself ...
you can &apos;t tell me what happened ?
i can &apos;t .
but believe me .
i got to go .
how are you with the office ?
good . it &apos;s odd to be back .
that &apos;s what cary said .
it &apos;s going well , right ? cary &apos;s trial ?
yes .
finn isn &apos;t ready . speedy trial strategy &apos;s working for us .
there might be something coming down the pike on cary .
i can &apos;t say what , but ...
is there anything we overlooked ?
i mean , a million things-- there always are .
what &apos;s your worry ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe nothing .
your husband &apos;s on the news talking about you .
you know , it reminds me of what president kennedy said
when he appointed his brother as attorney general .
something to the effect of : i can &apos;t see it as wrong
to give him a little legal experience ...
before he goes out to practice law .
oh , that was back when you could joke in politics .
but to be clear ... alicia actually has more experience
than robert f. kennedy did when he was attorney general .
you sound proud .
i am proud .
let &apos;s turn then to a subject that &apos;s been all over the news lately :
militarizing law enforcement .
the rise of the warrior cop .
yes .
imagine something like ferguson happening in chicago--
would you feel comfortable
using police officers carrying automatic weapons ,
driving around in humvees ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t say comfortable , no .
this is a civil rights issue , and i do ...
warren plep .
eli .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
what are you doing here , warren ?
nothing . you ?
just supporting my boy .
so you just happened in off the street ?
no . i know someone here .
a friend .
who ?
matt .
baloo .
really ?
baloo ? like in the jungle book ?
he &apos;s a producer here .
good seeing you , eli . got to go .
you &apos;re still the king of petition drives , aren &apos;t you , warren ?
i still dabble . you need something ?
i might .
unless you &apos;re already employed .
why would i be employed ?
i &apos;m just trying to figure out what you &apos;re doing here , warren .
you don &apos;t go anywhere without good reason .
i &apos;ve already told you my reason .
i have to go .
... protected police officers
under the doctrine of qualified immunity .
but that trend has reversed , hasn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t ...
quite know what you &apos;re referring to .
i &apos;m thinking of this , uh , recent 2nd circuit case .
swat team in connecticut smashed down a door ...
i wasn &apos;t prepared for it .
i looked like an idiot .
eli .
you @-@ you didn &apos;t look like an idiot .
i need a new personal attorney , eli--
someone to keep me up to speed on these issues .
i &apos;ll make up a list .
put ramona on it , would you ?
what ?
ramona lytton .
put her on the list .
the mother of the intern ?
well , she &apos;s not just the mother of the intern , she &apos;s a lawyer
and a family friend , and she needs a job .
when was the last time she practiced , mr. governor ?
when &apos;s the last time alicia did ?
put her on the list .
we have a problem .
wait . wait !
the problem is the opposite .
we have too much space now and too few lawyers .
so we lease it back .
yes , but if we grow , we &apos;ll be overcharged .
lease it out .
lease out the 27th floor .
we &apos;ve got 20 offices downstairs .
lease them out to other businesses .
well , all right , can we all have just a quiet discussion about leasing ?
what happened ?
we think a third candidate &apos;s joining the race .
i thought we were gonna ease her into it .
i changed my mind .
so , this is your office now ?
it &apos;s nice .
aren &apos;t we past the filing deadline ?
how can anybody be joining the race ?
well , if you gather 50,000 signatures ,
you can run by petition .
and is anyone doing that ?
warren plep
is a dc petition bundler .
he gathers signatures for petitions
in california and new york .
i saw him at the cbs studios during peter &apos;s interview .
why ? why was he there ?
well , he wouldn &apos;t say , but ...
my guess is frank prady .
the commentator ?
yes .
and that would not be good ?
no , it would be terrible .
he &apos;s a brand .
yes , and he &apos;s a bigger brand than you ,
so we &apos;ve got to do some polling .
it might mean nothing .
it could be for another office .
yes , but we &apos;ve looked back over his broadcast commentary
for the last three months ,
and he &apos;s disgusted with the murder rate in chicago
and he hates how castro &apos;s fighting it .
we &apos;ve been called back into court , so we &apos;re heading out .
on your case ?
yeah . should be about an hour .
do you know what it &apos;s about ?
no ,
no-- maybe it &apos;s good news .
maybe they &apos;re dropping the charges .
good luck .
so , what do we do now ?
we find out if it &apos;s true .
and how do we do that ?
you go to prady , and you ask for his endorsement .
what ?
he &apos;s endorsed candidates in other races .
if he does endorse you , then clearly he &apos;s not running .
if he doesn &apos;t , then ... there might be some problem there .
if he runs , i lose ?
well , anything can happen , b ...
yes , you lose .
okay ,
here we are again .
what &apos;s going on , counselor ?
it &apos;s not us , your honor .
it seems the asa has something up his sleeve .
a proof of other crimes charge , your honor .
your honor , uh , that is just wrong .
my client is innocent ,
and the state &apos;s attorney is conducting a vendetta .
we &apos;re not conducting a vendetta .
mr. agos used to be an asa , your honor ,
and while he was working here ,
he was also secretly working for lemond bishop .
what ?
that is ridiculous .
top drug dealer ...
and that is slanderous ,
your honor .
god almighty ,
stop it !
i &apos;m the one in control here .
what evidence do you have ?
we have evidence that mr. agos , when a deputy asa ,
buried evidence against his one @-@ time client ,
bishop , allowing mr. bishop to avoid prosecution .
now ... the evidence against him was two kilos of cocaine ,
which went missing after the defendant , mr. agos ,
removed it from the evidence room .
now , the prosecution merely asks
that they be allowed to use this evidence at trial .
bring this evidence tomorrow , and i will hear on this motion .
your honor ...
no . everybody shut up .
i already ruled . that &apos;s it .
governor florrick &apos;s office .
ramona ?
alicia , i thought that was you .
oh , my gosh .
what has it been , ten years ? you look great .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
a job interview .
can you believe it ?
for the legal job here .
that &apos;s great .
they need someone like you .
where are you coming from ?
where am i ... ?
what firm ?
nowhere . home .
been raising two kids , you know .
yes . of course . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s my first interview in , um ...
12 years .
that &apos;s great . you &apos;ll be great .
that &apos;s exactly what i did .
i know . i &apos;m modeling my career after yours .
uh , don &apos;t do that .
how &apos;s anton ?
we divorced last year .
he &apos;s in nashville , i think .
oh , ramona , i &apos;m sorry .
i keep stepping right in it .
no , you &apos;re great .
well , i probably ...
sure .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
good luck .
he wants to meet too today .
okay , good .
why do you two look so nervous ?
we don &apos;t want him in the race .
i know . neither do i.
we have a few issues we &apos;d like you to talk about .
his mother was attacked a year ago at her retirement community ,
and she was left with 20 stitches in her forehead .
okay . so ...
you want me to bring that up ?
no , try to talk about crimes against seniors
and how you &apos;re gonna push for stronger prosecutions .
that &apos;s a bit unsubtle , isn &apos;t it ?
alicia ,
you &apos;re not writing a poem-- you &apos;re practicing politics .
also , try to scare him off from running by suggesting
how much money you have in your pac .
how do i do that ?
you &apos;re asking for his endorsement .
it makes sense that you &apos;d bring up your grassroots support .
and don &apos;t mention his supreme court book .
he was disappointed with the sales .
okay , this is getting silly .
just set it up . i &apos;ll be good .
also , he &apos;s a fan of history .
cold war history .
i selected a few quotes .
no .
so mr. agos insisted on taking over all of lemond bishop &apos;s cases ?
yes .
and this was when he first
joined the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
no , when he was elevated to deputy .
and had he shown
any interest in the bishop cases previously ?
cary checked in with me pretty regularly ,
wanting to know how far along the investigation was ,
if we were building a strong case .
and what did you tell mr. agos ?
the bail restrictions . i have to keep 30 feet between us .
i know . i need your help on this .
they &apos;re trying to imply that cary was secretly working
for bishop when he was at the sa &apos;s office .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , it &apos;s all supposition and happenstance ,
but it &apos;s effective .
thank you . nothing further .
see what you can dig up to battle it .
counselor , excuse me .
sorry to break up the important meeting
you &apos;re having back there , but we &apos;re waiting .
yes , your honor . my apologies .
ms. pine , uh , you were already at the sa &apos;s office
when cary joined ?
i was .
and do you remember the reason
that he left private practice to come over ?
calls for speculation .
damn right . try again .
would you say that cary is a competitive person ?
your honor .
we &apos;ve already established that she is his colleague ,
not his therapist .
the prosecution &apos;s direct suggested
that my client took the bishop case for no reason .
it is within the scope to show that
he took a high @-@ profile case in order to prove himself .
and now she &apos;s testifying .
mr. agos is free to take the stand
and explain his own state of mind .
yes . thank you , your honor .
ms. pine , how long did you run the investigation
into lemond bishop &apos;s drug organization ?
almost two years .
and during that time , how many charges
did you file against mr. bishop ?
none .
really ? none ?
so isn &apos;t it likely
that they gave the bishop cases
to somebody who could do better ?
objection . argumentative .
no . no , overruled .
i want to hear it .
yes .
it &apos;s possible .
alicia . in here .
sorry . i was just getting changed .
no , thank you for meeting with me .
are you kidding ? i &apos;m a fan .
don &apos;t make fun of my cheeks . it &apos;s makeup for camera .
wow , frank .
a bit of a sweet tooth ?
no . do you like cookies ?
you have to have some . please .
uh , two tins . three tins , at least .
i &apos;m all right . thank you , though .
oh , it &apos;s these ladies online .
they have a @-@ a fan club .
and they get it into their heads that i like certain things .
last year they thought i was getting too much sun ,
so they sent me panama hats .
well , you must have a lot of fans .
well , not as many as you .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .
no , i &apos;m sure it is .
well , we &apos;re both popular then .
glad we settled that .
so ...
yes . you must be wondering
why i asked to meet with you .
no , my producer said ,
and i think it &apos;s a great idea .
oh , he @-@ he did ? really ? what did he say ?
that you wanted to pitch yourself for an interview .
no , actually .
but thank you .
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race ,
i &apos;m running .
yes , i know . condolences .
i mean , congratulations .
thank you .
and i was hoping to encourage you to ...
... to endorse me .
i hate just asking ,
but i ... well , i just did .
so there .
that is different .
and just so you know a little bit about what i stand for ,
chicago has one of the worst records in the country
prosecuting federal gun crimes ,
which means the sa &apos;s office has to pick up the slack .
and ... i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen the statistics
on crime against the elderly ,
but i would really want to beef up
on penalties for elder crime .
great . good .
just so you know , that &apos;s not true .
about my mom getting beaten up .
it was another lady in her retirement community .
the press got it wrong .
well , no , i didn &apos;t know that .
but it doesn &apos;t matter anyway . uh ...
i still feel bad for that ... lady ,
and , um , i believe it .
the elderly crime ...
thing .
he gave you cookies ?
yes . and an interview spot .
but no endorsement ?
no . he said he wanted to talk more in the interview .
i &apos;m not good at this , guys .
i &apos;m bad at asking for things .
i don &apos;t like asking ...
alicia , listen to me ,
you &apos;re running for office . the very nature of your job
is asking for things .
votes , money , help . it &apos;s a talent .
that &apos;s how politicians get you to love them ,
not by giving you something
but asking for something .
so you just got to get over your ...
feeling that you &apos;re above all this .
the real question is , do we do the interview ?
it could be a setup .
he uses a bad interview as a springboard
to launch his own campaign .
it &apos;s an audience . we have to .
yeah .
all right . we prep for hardball questions .
we make him think we &apos;re going in soft
and then we go for the jugular .
okay . all right , i &apos;ll handle the prep .
i &apos;ll go and , uh ...
where did you recover the two kilos of cocaine ,
officer sprayberry ?
stash house on kinzie street tied to lemond bishop .
and did you ever see the cocaine that you believed belonged
to mr. bishop again after you checked it in ?
no .
do you ...
normally see evidence again
after you check it in ?
standard operating procedure
is for the recovering officer to transport it for testing .
but mr. agos insisted on
taking this cocaine to the lab .
yes . he said he needed a quick check ,
off the books ,
so they could link it to bishop .
and you let him .
well , deputy sas have a lot of clout .
and he said this was the fastest way to take down bishop .
and was it ?
no .
once the cocaine disappeared ,
the case disappeared .
thank you .
nothing further , your honor .
be honest with me ,
how do i defend against this ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , what did you do ?
i checked the cocaine out to take it to the lab myself .
why ?
to expedite it .
cary , this testimony is killing us .
i know .
cary agos .
it &apos;s me .
where are you ?
turn around .
this is crazy .
i know .
30 feet .
you saw what they were doing in court ?
yeah .
i also know who you &apos;re protecting .
who ?
peter .
that &apos;s why you broke the rules at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
and took the cocaine to the lab .
because peter asked you to .
he was eyeing the governorship
and he knew that a bishop conviction would help .
that &apos;s supposition , kalinda .
no , it isn &apos;t .
you have to defend yourself , cary .
he did nothing wrong .
then subpoena him
and have him say that .
he has nothing to do with the coke going missing .
well , neither do you .
but they &apos;ll crucify him .
cary , they &apos;re crucifying you .
look , you have to tell them that you were under orders .
i can &apos;t .
then i will .
kalinda , no .
kalinda .
kalinda ?
30 feet , cary .
ramona , welcome .
how was your first day of school ? you find the lunchroom ?
no , but that &apos;s okay . i ...
it &apos;s the next floor down .
just off the elevator .
okay . great .
um , there &apos;s something that came across my desk ...
the paperwork for the new offices . don &apos;t worry .
that &apos;s not time sensitive . i have to take this .
do you mind ? yep .
what ? mm @-@ hmm .
why am i being subpoenaed ?
because diane wants to drag you
into this proof of other crime nonsense .
you think this has to do with the supreme court rejection ?
of course it has to do with the supreme court rejection .
it says here that you ordered cary
to violate evidence @-@ handling rules
in order to push a high @-@ profile prosecution .
this is a nightmare .
we need to file a motion based on privilege .
yes . good idea .
i don &apos;t ...
i &apos;m gonna meet with cary . i know he doesn &apos;t want to go there .
i know that .
how about that for a first day , huh ?
i &apos;ll have one of the paralegals help you
file a motion to quash based on privilege .
i don &apos;t think we should do that .
what do you mean ?
why ?
ramona , uh , let &apos;s discuss this .
no , wait . i want to know why .
they &apos;re expecting us to do it .
they want us
to argue that any conversation between the then sa
and mr. agos is privileged work product .
they want it to look like you &apos;re covering something up .
so ... don &apos;t .
okay .
what would you do ?
go on offensive .
no matter what mr. agos was told by his superior ,
it doesn &apos;t excuse him from having committed a crime .
i can file a motion to quash based on relevance .
the governor isn &apos;t hiding anything .
he is busy .
and the defense is merely trying to stall
by dragging him into this .
do it .
thank you , mr. governor .
oh , and , um ... i wouldn &apos;t talk to cary .
they &apos;ll use it against you .
not bad , huh ?
we &apos;ll see .
isn &apos;t your law partner facing drug conspiracy
charges , mrs. florrick ?
he is . but those charges have not been proven yet .
never accept the premise of the question .
your answer can be edited down to &quot; he is . &quot;
always jump back to your pivot .
my pivot ?
yeah . this is the most important advice
i &apos;m ever gonna give you , alicia .
questions are for dopes .
they are ?
yes . say it .
questions are for dopes .
isn &apos;t that the point of an interview ?
no , the point of an interview is to put you on the spot ,
and your point is to pivot back to your message .
and what is my message ?
castro is ruining the department .
now , mrs. florrick , your law partner
is facing drug conspiracy charges .
why shouldn &apos;t voters trust you based on who you associate with ?
because my partner is innocent and the current state &apos;s attorney
is pursuing a vendetta against him to get back at me .
good . stick with it-- message discipline .
but doesn &apos;t your law firm also represent lemond bishop ,
the biggest drug dealer in chicago ?
alleged drug dealer .
come on , alicia-- lemond bishop .
in our legal system ,
everyone deserves a vigorous defense .
but not everyone deserves you .
unlike the current state &apos;s attorney ,
i &apos;ve seen both sides of the courtroom .
i know how and when the system is abused .
good . um , don &apos;t cross your legs under the table .
why ?
well , it keeps you from sitting up straight .
so cross at the ankles .
now , let &apos;s talk about the abortion
your son got for his underage girlfriend .
is anything wrong , mrs. florrick ?
is this you talking , or prady ?
prady .
and always use his first name-- frank .
well , frank ,
i obviously find this situation very difficult .
my son ...
no .
you want my real answer ?
sure .
how dare you ?
how in the world does it possibly
impact my work as a prosecutor
to ask about my family &apos;s most vulnerable moments ?
well , it &apos;s ... this city is suffering from the worst
murder spree in its history ,
and you &apos;re asking me about my son &apos;s abortion ?
are you frigging kidding me ?
okay . let &apos;s unpack that .
good second half , though i &apos;m not sure about &quot; frigging . &quot;
and bad first half .
you can &apos;t personalize it , alicia .
it &apos;s not frank .
well , if he asks about zach , then it is about frank .
well , the passion is good ,
you just have to control it .
people don &apos;t necessarily hear the words ,
but they get a sense of it from
your tone of voice and your arm movements .
so try to keep them in check .
gotcha .
okay .
have you heard these rumors that your husband
is sleeping with an intern in the governor &apos;s office ?
again , this type of politics of personal destruction ...
cliche .
again , this type of ... horse ...
yeah , you can &apos;t ...
this kind of b.s. is why people don &apos;t run for office .
it &apos;s why i almost didn &apos;t run .
and then i realized if i didn &apos;t ,
only people like castro would .
good , good . and don &apos;t look at the camera .
act as if it &apos;s just the two of you talking .
and watch out for the second camera .
sometimes , in the middle of a question ,
they &apos;ll cut to you and try to catch you off guard .
and don &apos;t be afraid to say
&quot; i don &apos;t agree with your characterization . &quot;
okay .
anything else ?
am i ready ?
for now .
you &apos;re a bundle of optimism .
your honor , cary agos was only following the orders
of his superior , peter florrick ,
who was state &apos;s attorney at that time .
that &apos;s why we subpoenaed him .
that he is governor is immaterial .
we &apos;re only interested in his actions as the state &apos;s attorney .
counselor .
yeah ?
it &apos;s customary at this point for you to say something .
if the governor &apos;s counsel is arguing
that peter florrick held some sort of privilege ...
i &apos;m not .
or even had qualified immunity ...
i &apos;m not saying that , either .
well , then , what are you saying ?
anyone ? asa polmar ?
qualified immunity doesn &apos;t apply here .
a little louder .
just spill it out .
your honor . sir .
ms. lockhart is desperate to make this hearing about
governor florrick &apos;s refusal to testify .
i &apos;m not desperate about anything .
she wants me to put up some shield--
privilege , immunity-- so that when he doesn &apos;t take the stand ,
you can draw a negative inference from that fact .
the defense has to prove governor florrick
can offer some testimony that would impact her client &apos;s guilt .
but he can &apos;t .
mr. agos isn &apos;t being accused of transporting drugs
against police regulations .
he &apos;s being accused of stealing drugs .
i must prove one ...
and even the defense isn &apos;t accusing the governor
of ordering mr. agos to steal these drugs , ......
my client has nothing to contribute here .
accordingly , we respectfully submit
the subpoena be quashed . immediately .
and , your honor , we ... respectfully disagree .
proof of other crimes presented during trial could have
an enormous negative impact on a defendant .
accordingly , the defendant deserves every opportunity
to have such evidence excluded .
in this instance , however ,
i cannot compel the testimony of a witness ,
let alone a sitting governor .
the motion to quash is granted .
prosecution has leave to introduce
evidence of mr. agos &apos; involvement
in the disappearance of the cocaine at trial .
that &apos;s it .
you can go . next .
well done .
okay , they said , uh , 20 more seconds .
uh , they &apos;ll introduce you in d.c. ,
so you won &apos;t hear that here .
okay , here we go .
that &apos;s right , jim .
first the husband , now the wife .
i can always ask her .
where do you find the time , alicia ?
the time ?
yes , you @-@ you started your own law firm , you have responsibilities
that come with your husband &apos;s job , there &apos;s family , and now
you &apos;re running for state &apos;s attorney .
well ... yes .
um , how do you prioritize ?
family first , of course .
okay ,
let &apos;s start with your family .
oh , no ,
um , what i was going to say ,
is like most busy people , i triage .
how @-@ how do your , uh , how do your husband and kids
feel about you taking on this sa race ?
fine .
peter , uh , has done the job ,
so he &apos;s been really helpful .
and my children , growing up in this family ,
understand how important it is to do public service .
is that something you talk about explicitly ,
sitting around the dinner table , or is it a lesson
they get by florrick family osmosis ?
we have , uh , dinner together ,
like other families . we talk .
oh , i &apos;m sure .
i @-@ i was just interested ...
if you like to sit down and discuss criminal justice
over the chicken , or gab about reality tv .
i don &apos;t watch reality tv .
or @-@ or whatever . my dad was a police officer ,
uh , which i thought was fascinating ,
but he never wanted to talk about that at home .
for him , it was all chicago bears , all the time .
what the hell ?
she &apos;s braced for hardball . she &apos;ll relax into it .
one challenge in being a prosecutor and a mom , i imagine ,
will be seeing the absolute worst side of the world
you &apos;re sending your kids into .
does that worry you ?
to the contrary , i think it will help me remember
what &apos;s at stake every time we try an accused criminal .
something that the current state &apos;s attorney is failing to do .
okay .
is that part of the logic of your campaign ?
replacing the @-@ the prosecutor machismo
with the perspective of someone
who &apos;s spent the majority of her life raising kids ?
i &apos;m sorry ,
i disagree with your characterization of me as
someone who spent the majority of her life raising kids .
oh , i apologize . i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean it as an insult .
oh , no , uh , there &apos;s no need ... to apologize . um ...
i &apos;m proud of being a mother .
i just ... i &apos;ve done a lot of other things .
oh , god , oh , god .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay , we can move on from this .
it was like watching a ship go down .
and i couldn &apos;t do anything about it .
it was like my @-@ my mouth was on automatic pilot .
he katie couric @-@ ed you .
you think it was planned ? serving up softballs ?
if she answers them earnestly , she looks like a lightweight .
if she doesn &apos;t answer them , she looks like a prig ?
i need something to drink .
wait , we have something to tell you .
i did some intel .
prady is running .
how do you know ?
i talked to a friend in warren plep &apos;s office .
they &apos;re gathering signatures for a prady run .
and they &apos;re doing polling .
then we &apos;re sunk .
no , no , not yet .
there &apos;s always a plan &quot; b. &quot;
we dirty him up . fast .
we scare him into not running .
with what ?
well , leave that to us .
okay .
i &apos;m going home to get drunk .
that &apos;s a joke , right ?
it is . i know .
don &apos;t joke .
yeah ?
your bank account balance ...
okay . who are you ?
i &apos;m kalinda sharma .
you work at the crime lab .
and that is your bank account balance .
and as you can see , you received $ 30,000 six months ago ...
i &apos;m going to go to the police unless you answer my questions .
what questions ?
well , this $ 30,000 couldn &apos;t have come
from your salary at the crime lab , so who paid you ?
i won the money .
oh . how ?
at a riverboat casino .
oh . which one ?
tell me the truth , liana , or this is gonna get worse .
i never did anything like that before .
like what ?
it was my cousin .
he knew the drugs were coming through there , and he wanted them back .
who &apos;s your cousin ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
you want to take the fall for this yourself ?
i don &apos;t know where he is .
he took off because he was scared of lemond bishop .
tell me his name ?
trey wagner .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
i got to go .
look , do you stay in touch with him ?
no . good @-@ bye .
&quot; gary , indiana . &quot;
hello , trey .
no .
i &apos;m not here for bishop .
lady , whenever i meet you , there &apos;s trouble .
then let &apos;s talk .
&quot; sovereignty for me , not for thee . &quot;
it &apos;s a law review article frank prady wrote as a student .
it &apos;s about how israeli settlements in the west bank
violate the geneva convention .
really ?
it &apos;ll kill him with jewish voters .
and evangelical christians .
no .
no , he &apos;s right . the evangelicals will be turned off , too .
no , we &apos;re not using this .
why ?
because we don &apos;t even know if he still believes this .
what does that matter ?
because it does .
and it has nothing to do with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race .
alicia , part of running is about electability .
attitude toward israel goes to electability .
we &apos;re not getting involved with this .
she &apos;s right .
let &apos;s have the pac do it .
no . we &apos;re not giving it to the pac .
we are not using it .
look ...
i &apos;m learning a lot from you guys ,
but you need to learn something from me , too .
he &apos;ll run , you &apos;ll lose .
maybe .
what do you think ? you know her better than i do .
we can &apos;t use it .
we can &apos;t slip it to the pac , either .
there might be another way .
finn polmar .
you &apos;re looking for trey wagner ?
i might be . who am i talking to ?
i found him .
he might be willing to testify .
against cary agos ?
no . lemond bishop .
get castro now .
why would he , um , testify against bishop ?
for two reasons .
he feels guilty about framing cary agos , who did nothing wrong .
well , how exactly did he frame cary ?
he turned the recording on
only for what the cops wanted to hear .
okay , and what &apos;s the second reason ?
you &apos;re going to grant him immunity ?
and you don &apos;t want to tell me your name ?
i &apos;m only interested in justice .
agos is innocent , bishop is guilty .
where are you right now ?
i &apos;m with trey . you want to talk to him ?
yes , i would .
trey , you &apos;re on .
so , we need to offer wagner immunity and protection ,
and then he &apos;ll testify against bishop .
i thought he was giving us cary agos .
well , he said agos didn &apos;t do anything .
you know , he only offered us the lawyer
because he was afraid of turning on bishop .
but now he &apos;s turning on bishop .
well , his sister &apos;s christian . she &apos;s convinced him to come clean .
okay , but can he connect bishop
to the $ 1.3 million in heroin ?
no , no , no , he said that was his .
he and a few other crew members were selling that on their own .
but he can connect bishop to other drug deliveries .
he can connect them the way he connected agos ?
well , he &apos;s turning on his boss .
no , he &apos;s admitting that he lied about agos .
why do we trust him now ?
because we want bishop .
yes . we want agos to get us to bishop .
that &apos;s the strategy . that should continue .
cary agos is innocent .
no , trey says that he &apos;s innocent .
maybe he &apos;s lying to us now .
what &apos;s going on , jim ?
nothing . i think we should stick to the original strategy .
is this about your campaign ?
i think you should reconsider what you just said .
you don &apos;t care about bishop .
you care about alicia florrick .
get out of my office .
you &apos;re kidding me .
nope .
when ?
roughly four hours ago .
oh , my god .
i thought i was having a weird day .
why ? what was your day ?
no , no , no , no , no , we &apos;re gonna stick with you .
what ... ? why ?
i was disagreeing with castro about trial strategy .
on cary &apos;s case ?
can &apos;t tell you .
i can &apos;t . i resigned , but it &apos;s still confidential .
i think you will tell me after three more drinks .
maybe .
wow . so , what are you gonna do ?
make some money .
open my own practice .
do you have office space ?
no .
no . i &apos;ll probably go looking tomorrow .
i may have something .
office space . where ?
the 27th floor of our building . we &apos;re renting it out .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a little bit incestuous .
if we were siblings .
i can get you a deal .
i &apos;ll think about it .
so , how was your day ?
well ...
let me be clear .
i am pro @-@ israel and proud of it .
so i have to disagree vehemently with anyone who still harbors
大学国际法报道
a youthful fascination with the palestinian cause ...
got to be kidding me .
sa castro made these remarks earlier today in response ...
did you see this ?
yeah . i &apos;m watching it now .
i told you not to leak that article .
alicia , i didn &apos;t . castro did .
and you expect me to believe that ?
look , we all do the same searches , we all find the same dirt .
this is a good thing .
this hurts prady without reflecting on you .
... for the palestinian cause ...
you saw the news ?
i did .
so , what do we do now ?
well , i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s anything to do .
i have to find out if this was elfman ,
or if eli pushed him .
what are you talking about ?
the leak of prady &apos;s anti @-@ israel article .
no . trey wagner died in a car accident last night ,
along with his cousin--
the two people who could help cary and harm bishop .
we &apos;re going to meet the new prosecutor now .
i am so sorry .
good luck .
yes ?
frank prady is here for you .
excuse me ?
frank prady . he knows he doesn &apos;t have an appointment ,
but he asked if you have ten minutes .
i ... o @-@ okay .
hold on one second .
you know what ? just send him ... send him back .
oh . mr. prady .
how are you ?
uh , fine .
uh , no , actually , not fine .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . why is that ? can i get you something to drink ?
no . no . uh ... i &apos;ve been losing friends this morning .
why ?
this article . this , uh ,
thought project from a while back--
uh , it &apos;s been sent to the press ...
let me be clear .
i am pro @-@ israel .
yes , i , uh ... i saw it .
i don &apos;t like losing friends .
i don &apos;t either .
uh , you asked me to endorse you .
yes , i would love your endorsement .
i &apos;m disgusted by the personal nature of politics .
i hate campaigns being treated like bad reality shows .
how lives are exposed ,
and human beings treated like ...
commodities .
yeah . i hate it , too .
so ...
i &apos;ve decided to run for state &apos;s attorney .
the only way to change it is to have skin in the game .
so i can &apos;t endorse you .
uh , i have resigned from cbs .
uh , i intend to run by petition .
you could have called me to say that .
yes , i could have ,
but i wanted to give you my reasons .
this @-@ this leak of my youthful views has changed my mind .
you &apos;re such a hypocrite .
excuse me ?
you &apos;ve known for days now that you are running .
you had me jumping through hoops for your endorsement
when you knew .
you had warren plep out there
getting you signatures , doing your polling .
so don &apos;t act like you &apos;re trying to change the system .
you are the system .
plep was doing that on his own . he was the one pitching me .
i think we &apos;re done here , mr. prady .
i didn &apos;t decide to run until this leak today .
eli , he &apos;s running . he &apos;s in my office .
i intended to support you until i discovered
it was your team that gave my article to castro .
is there something else you need , mr. prady ?
no .
good luck , mrs. florrick .
yup , it was fun . see you out there .
