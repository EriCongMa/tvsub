i &apos;m sure how mom and dad are surprised
by the anniversary breakfast we &apos;re bringing to them .
i hate to walk in if they are naked .
yes , that kind of image could haunt someone
if she tries to sleep even years later .
oh , relax . i think you are safe .
or are they ?
it &apos;s our 20th anniversary ,
so today at the school fair ,
a band called the dad beats
is gonna surprise claire with a power love ballad .
and the lead singer -- you might want to sit down --
is the one and only --
get up on your feet ! -- this guy !
* she &apos;s a pretty sight *
* wise as a buddha *
* but , brother , watch that bite *
* &quot; cause she &apos;s a claire @-@ acuda *
or maybe an existing song .
thank you .
do you want to get your face painted
like a pretty butterfly ?
no . i &apos;m just not in the mood .
lily , what about you ?
you know what ?
maybe i will have them paint
&quot; worst coach ever &quot; on my forehead .
cam &apos;s coaching freshman football ,
and his team &apos;s losing ,
and it &apos;s making him , uh , a little tense .
run , run !
protect it like it &apos;s your baby !
you dropped your baby !
you dropped your baby !
they &apos;re running away with your baby !
go get your baby !
that &apos;s the worst call since
they cast russell crowe in &quot; les mis , &quot;
right there !
you see the way everyone &apos;s glaring at me ?
no .
like a big loser coach .
all in your head .
i &apos;m the hester prynne of freshman football .
i may as well have a
scarlet &quot; l &quot; sewn on my shirt .
well , then , everyone would think you &apos;re laverne .
coach tucker .
that was a tough loss last night .
yeah , yeah . sure was .
i feel your frustration . sure do .
uh , mitchell , this is john . he &apos;s trevor &apos;s dad .
sorry .
star running back .
well , maybe not for long .
i &apos;m seriously thinking about pulling him from the team .
what ? why ?
&apos;cause trevor &apos;s getting killed out there .
you got no one to block for him .
i @-@ i hear what you &apos;re saying , and you &apos;re not wrong ,
but give me a little time .
you got one week .
well , that is not appropriate fair behavior at all .
you know what might make you feel better ?
gathering my team and putting the fear of god in them .
i was gonna say a churro .
i can do both !
she &apos;s a mess .
girl ...
hey , hey , lead foot , easy on the turns !
i worked hours on this cake .
you &apos;re sure you want to do this ?
i &apos;m going to win the cake contest ,
and then there &apos;ll be no stopping me .
from what ? a beating ?
first @-@ place ribbons earn respect , jay .
not if your competition &apos;s
a bunch of old ladies and weirdos .
could you just be nice ?
you didn &apos;t seem to care
when you were eating all his practice cake .
finally .
what are you gonna do , pal ? !
about to ask you the same thing .
did you not see my blinker ?
nope .
then you &apos;re blind , &apos; cause it &apos;s on .
looking at you , i &apos;m guessing it was on the whole way here .
i got all day and satellite radio .
i don &apos;t care if parking here is on your bucket list .
i &apos;ve got two books on tape , a space blanket ,
and a protein bar in the glove box .
i will sleep here if i have to .
we &apos;re not moving .

oh , wait !
um ... seriously , mandy , do you , uh --
do you really have to do that ?
i see what you &apos;re doing .

differently over there .
she &apos;s my age ,
and we &apos;re engaged ... to be engaged .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a pre @-@ engagement .
she &apos;s in the coast guard .

oh , good . she &apos;s protecting our lake .
i &apos;ll be out by the pool .
your boss is calling you .

i don &apos;t need your money -- i need advice ...
about a girl .
gross , but i &apos;m intrigued , so talk .
alex . hey , girlita .
sienna ... girl !
sienna is amazing -- stylish , worldly --
and she &apos;s so new to our school , she doesn &apos;t even realize
that i &apos;m a full social class below her .
i need to cement the friendship
before she finds out we have a cafeteria .
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
uh , this is my little brother , luke .
he wants advice on some lame crush he has .
that &apos;s huge .
so huge .
so , luke , who is this mystery woman ?
um ... just some girl .
and her name is sienna .
you know , manny , i &apos;m just gonna say this one last time .
i doubt that .
give me that .
you want to fit in ?
you &apos;re not doing yourself any favors
with this cake contest .
i don &apos;t know . chefs get all the girls .
you &apos;re a baker .
bakers are girls --
betty crocker , mrs. fields , little debbie .
what about the pillsbury doughboy ?
that &apos;s a good one , manny !
well , well , well . jay pritchett .
nice of you to finally show up .
what &apos;s happening ?
you &apos;re an official fair cop .
your wife volunteered you .
gloria !
i love you ! have fun !
what is this ?
it &apos;s for charity .
people pay for you to arrest
and throw somebody in jail for 10 minutes .
and here comes your partner .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , hell , no . i &apos;m not working with this clown .
hey , who are you calling a clown , bucket list ?
i see you two have already met .
that was my space and you know it .
tell it to my car . you know where to find it .
hey , enough of you two squabbling .
i &apos;ve got the pta breathing down my neck .
just pin these on and get to work .
nope . can &apos;t do the badge . sorry .
my wife just bought me this shirt ,
and if i ruin it , she &apos;ll kill me .
you &apos;re afraid you &apos;ll ruin your blouse .
it &apos;s not a blouse ! it &apos;s a shirt .
she bought it at the men &apos;s department , so it &apos;s a shirt .
here &apos;s your first arrest .
she &apos;s over at the dizzy dragon .
word on the midway is she &apos;s tougher than she looks .
think you can handle it ?
why couldn &apos;t i handle it ?
&apos;cause she &apos;s your daughter .
hello ?
oh , hi , mr. chang . yeah .
what do you mean you &apos;re at the house already ?
you &apos;re not supposed to be there for another two hours .
i have a long history of giving phil
bad anniversary gifts ,
but this year , i have planned something amazing .
the traditional 20th gift is china ,
but what am i gonna do , give him a plate ?
i already did that .
okay , bye .
honey , um , what do you say we pack it in and go home ?
what ? no . i mean , we just got here .
i haven &apos;t even whacked a mole yet .
i know , but i just got off the ferris wheel ,
and i &apos;m feeling really queasy .
but you &apos;re gonna miss the dad beats .
no way . come on .
let &apos;s get you a fried pickle !
phil , i might throw up .
no one throws up until i sing .
phil , we got to go . we got to go home now .
sure . why not ? nothing keeping you here .
why are you acting weird ?
i &apos;m not acting weird .
got her .
ma &apos;am , i am afraid you are under arrest .
uh , no . dad , tell him i can &apos;t do this right now .
come on . please .
go ahead . read her the charges .
can &apos;t do this .
all right . let &apos;s see .
you have been charged with unlawful sexiness
and possession of a hot booty .
that is wrong .
guilty as charged .
stop it !
all right , 10 minutes in the slammer .
no , i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t have time for this . phil !
oh , my god !
what are you doing , perv ? !
getting proof of where the two missing beers went .
you can &apos;t drink that out here .
hmm . let &apos;s see if you &apos;re right .
mm , no .
okay , well , you &apos;re in a pool zone ,
and that is glass , so that &apos;s not safe .
it &apos;s dangerous .
what is with you and your girlfriend protecting water ?
okay , just --
if you just -- no -- no , uh , uh !
oh ! d-- ahh ! d @-@ d-- oh , dilly !
well , now you &apos;ve done it .
you &apos;re gonna have to climb in there
and get all the glass out of the pool .
um , i just got my hair straightened ,
so that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i hate to go all ballistic ,
but it has not been a pleasure meeting you .
do you kiss your imaginary girlfriend with that mouth ?
i do , but she &apos;s real . so , she &apos;s a real girl .
it all comes down to one thing , gentlemen --
focus ...
and teamwork and heart !
you see this mallet ?
think i can swing this here mallet with one finger ?
no ! i need my whole team !
because when you &apos;re functioning and working as a team ,
gentlemen , look out !
sassy granny ?
yeah , sassy granny .
yes , exactly .
because that is what you all played like last night --
is a bunch of sassy grannies .
but we &apos;re gonna bust our humps this week ,
and we &apos;re gonna get out there ,
and we &apos;re gonna play like a bunch of ...
girly men . got it .
okay , you know what ? is this thing plugged in ?
it &apos;s not electric .
i think it was made in the 1800s .
okay , well , that &apos;s my point .
this is outdated .
this is offensive ,
because girls are athletes , too .
so , in conclusion ...
if you want to win football games ,
we got to go out there and play like a ...
what is daddy doing ?
daddy &apos;s smashing his demons .
oh , like the ones you vacuum up at home ?
yeah , yeah . like that .
mm ! damn . near miss .
why the hell are you so dressed up for a school fair , anyway ?
how is this dressed up ? !
i &apos;m -- why ?
because my shirt has buttons ?

get your vanilla fingers away from my shirt !
blouse .
okay ...
you want to talk about clothes ? let &apos;s talk about clothes .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s see .
you look like some kind of old , washed @-@ up golf pro
who drank his way off the tour
and is one step away from writing a suicide note
with one of them little pencils .
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean that .
you wouldn &apos;t have said it if you didn &apos;t mean it .
i don &apos;t have the body to wear the clothes they make today ,
so i dress comfortable .
you &apos;re in shape , man .
what are you ? late 50s ?
come on . you know i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m serious , man .
y @-@ you look like you live at the gym .
i do some walking .
yeah ?
pritchett , williams ,
got another arrest over by the ferris wheel .
on it .
here we go .
why &apos;d we throw out the ice cream ?
we got plenty of time .
seeing manny up there
with the misfits and their crazy cakes ,
i started to wonder if jay was right .
maybe manny would fit in better
if he was more like the other boys .
and maybe i needed to give him a little push .
i saw you .
all right , young lady .
you &apos;re under arrest .
what ?
you have the right to remain silent .
good luck with that .
grandpa !
sorry , honey . part of the job .
out of the way !
let &apos;s go .
who did this ? !
hmm . i guess it &apos;s just you and me .
my cake ! somebody ruined it !
who would do that ? !
ay ! manny , how terrible . all your hard work .
oh , well . let &apos;s go ride the rides .
no , no , no . mom , i know who did it .
oh , you do ?
it was enid .
ah . look at her .
you can see the hate in her eyes .
the minute she saw this , she felt threatened .
she &apos;s cold as ice .
how about you just let it go
and go play with the other boys ?
oh , she &apos;d love that .
okay , enid .
you want to dance ? let &apos;s dance .
let me have my cellphone . come on . i got to make a call .
sorry . those are the rules .
what are you smiling at ?
i &apos;m six .
oh , god .
all right . got another one for you here .
hi , honey .
come on .
one count of being an aggravating big sister .
that &apos;s 8 to 10 minutes .
luke did this ? ! i was just trying to help him .
help him do what ?
my friend sienna and i were trying to help him
find this girl he has a crush on .
honey , sienna is the girl he has a crush on .
come on , haven &apos;t you ever seen the way he looks at her ?
it &apos;s same way he used to look at halloween candy .
oh , my god . he &apos;s gonna do something stupid
and ruin it for me .
i have to get out of here .
okay . all right . i got a plan . i got this .
i &apos;m gonna create a distraction .
just got to get that little guard over here .
you &apos;re gonna sit down very quietly ,
right by the door .
great plan , mom . let me know how that works out for you .
it &apos;s a fake lock .
how long were you gonna sit on that ?
found another one .
i told you .
are you gonna do that every time ?
you found glass ,
not the lost city of atlanta .
wow , i &apos;m gonna chalk that one up
to a lot of underage drinking .
you &apos;re bleeding .
what ?
i do not like blood . i do not like blood .
is it bad ?
here .
oh , my god !
what ?
your fingers are so stubby , like baby carrots .

here . hold still .
let me put some pressure on it .
so , why are you a manny , anyway ?
saving up for college .
plus , i like kids .
&apos;cause they make your hands seem normal ?
okay . thank you .
i &apos;m good . thank you .
luke , i hate to say it ,
but maybe this girl left .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
i mean , even if i found her --
ah , forget it . it &apos;s embarrassing .
no . tell me .
i wouldn &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;ve never kissed a girl before .
oh ! it &apos;s not that hard .
you know what ?
i &apos;ll kiss you once to show you how it &apos;s done .
really ? okay . want to go behind the dumpster ?
no . here is fine .
okay . it &apos;s not really how i imagined it , but ...

* in case i need it when i &apos;m older *

you think that &apos;s amazing ?
wait till i smash this thing
right on top of enid &apos;s piece of sheet cake .
no , no , no ! wait ! manny , enid didn &apos;t do it .
i did it .
what ?
i was the one who ruined the cake .
i was afraid that all those boys were gonna make fun of you .
i think i care more about you fitting in than you do .
no . i care .
i care a lot .
it &apos;s just the stuff i &apos;m good at
isn &apos;t the stuff that makes you popular .
contestants , all cakes
must be at the judges &apos; table in 60 seconds .
ay , there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna make it through that crowd .
like heck we won &apos;t . here .
what ?
follow my lead .
okay .
ready ? come on .
oh , well , look who finally put down his mallet .
you done having your little temper tantrum ?
it wasn &apos;t that bad .
cam , your behavior was completely juvenile ,
and i don &apos;t think that it set a very good example --
hey , hey ! no cutsies --
for lily .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just frustrated .
i @-@ i can &apos;t seem to turn this team into a winner .
oh , why do you let it get you so stressed out ?
it &apos;s just football .
you know what football was to me ?
football was my salvation .
every time i stepped onto that field ,
i wasn &apos;t the weird gay outsider kid anymore .
i inspired my entire team
because i had something to prove .
where &apos;s my kid that has something to prove ?
come on mom !
stay on my hip ! follow my lead !
move !
that &apos;s exactly what i need .
oh ! come on ! come on , mom .
cake ?
tell them the good news .
i won the cake contest !
the other good news .
he made the football team .
they won their first game .
and the guys love my banana bread .
keep your eyes closed , and before you open them ,
remember that for 20 years ,
you have given me perfect , creative , thoughtful gifts .
and every year , i have let you down .
you &apos;re about to feel really bad , and i know that ,
because it &apos;s how i have felt every year .
but , honey , it is not my intention ,
because i love you .
happy anniversary .
oh , my god . chinese acrobats ? !
20 years -- china .
you &apos;re brilliant .
you got it !
hey , guys ! you &apos;re my present !
oh -- oh , what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s the helicopter . i should get in there .
no , no , they &apos;re -- they &apos;re here for you .
they &apos;re here for you .
oh ... honey .
don &apos;t worry , it was just a couple of beers ,
and if you cleaned it up ...
okay , haley , i love you , too . bye .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
i hear you &apos;re a wanted woman .
what you see can and will be held against you .
you &apos;re gonna have to arrest me first .
bring me some wine .
mr. p. , i have a confession to make .
i &apos;m taking a much more interesting confession upstairs .
after joe went down ,
i had a sip of beer by the pool ,
and a bottle broke .
it was me . i did it .
don &apos;t sweat it .
i popped a cold one after dealing with those kids --
sometimes during .
thanks , mr. p. -- and , hey ...
be careful up there .
