第七季 第七集
This is me,
I was traveling at 35 miles per hour down Bosworth Avenue,
when I saw the light at Le Moyne changing,
so I pulled to a stop.
And did you see something in your rearview mirror?
I did.
A car coming up behind me.
And how fast was it traveling?
About 35 miles per hour.
But it didn't stop or slow down.
It just rammed right into my car.
It shoved me into the cross traffic,
and that's how I ended up here.
In a wheelchair.
For life.
Yes.
Who was driving the car that hit you, Wendy?
Him.
Let the record reflect
that Wendy pointed to Tim Brewster.
Excuse me, I wasn't driving that car.
Tim.
What?
Why aren't you objecting?
It's a depo, Tim.
We'll get to your side of things.
Who was behind the wheel, Wendy?
Tim Brewster.
And did he see you?
Yes. I saw him in the rearview mirror.
He clearly saw my car.
But he didn't slow down? He didn't stop?
hat's right.
Would you like to say something, Mr. Ephraham?
I'm not being deposed.
It wasn't my fault,
And you know it-- it was your car's fault.
Why don't we take a moment, please?
Tim, I thought we agreed.
We're going in there with a united front.
Yeah, somehow a united front means I get screwed.
It was in driverless mode.
I tried hitting the brake, I tried turning.
That's impossible, and you know it.
Even in driverless mode, it can be overridden
at any time.
Yeah, yeah.
And I'm telling you I couldn't override it.
Then that's your fault, isn't it? You illegally...
All right, let's not talk about fault.
Great job.
Keep blaming Tim, it'll split 'em up.
Then what?
They're setting you up.
I'm not talking to you.
What else can they do?
Your CEO friend can't admit that it was his autonomous car
that malfunctioned...
Buddy, save yourself the breath.
I'm not joining your side.
Don't.
But get yourself your own lawyer.
Because they're not gonna defend you.
Your business means nothing to them.
It's the CEO that's the deep pocket here.
艾丽西娅·福瑞克 可出庭律师
Call her.
Everybody, take your seats please.
We're ready to start.
Vote no on the first vote.
Don't forget.
Well, welcome back
to the Chicago Election Board, everyone.
We have a full agenda, so I'd like to get started.
But first I'd like to welcome our newest member.
Alicia Florrick.
We want to thank her for giving her expertise
and her independence to the great work of this committee.
I believe, uh, we still have a vote outstanding.
Yes, we do, Mr. Chair.
Regarding the status of KLT.
We were tied, three to three.
Thank you, Mr. Hallman.
The tabled motion was to replace
the current licensee with Swan systems.
All those in favor of Mr. Hallman's motion,
please raise your hand.
All those opposed.
Three opposed.
We're tied again.
Mrs. Florrick, you have the right to vote...
She doesn't have to vote.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea what the issue is.
Mr. Hallman believes
we should replace our current contractor
for election machines with a new one, Swan systems.
Even though you are new
to this committee, Mrs. Florrick, you can vote.
If she doesn't want to vote, she doesn't have to vote.
Mrs. Florrick, do you want to vote?
Good.
All those in favor of the motion.
All those opposed.
No, this is bullcrap.
You bought her!
Mr. Hallman!
No, sir! I supported your membership,
Mrs. Florrick,
because I thought you would be honest here.
The vote didn't go your way, sir.
Now get over it.
Okay. Let's move on to the financial...
Everything all right?
Yeah. You heading out?
Prior accidents of a self-driving car.
Ah. What?
New case. Four hours, capped.
Can you do me a favor?
That depends.
Could you find out about a company
called klt and what connection it has
With the head of the democratic committee, Frank Landau?
All right. What am I looking for?
Anything.
Anything it is.
Maybe you and I could talk sometime.
Sure. What about?
Everything.
Okay. Tonight. 7:00 p.M.
Done.
Mrs. Florrick, I am so glad you're doing this.
So am I.
We'll meet you there, Tim.
Good case. A three-way.
With who?
Lockhart/Agos and Louis Canning.
It should be fun.
What's wrong now, Eli?
Have any reporters tried to call you?
No. Why?
If anyone tries to call you, don't answer.
Why?
Vice is reporting
that you and Peter have not shared a bed for three years.
Oh, dear god.
Yeah.
We're gonna face some uncomfortable questions.
Let us focus group some answers before you say anything.
You'd better get in there.
Alicia, I'll call you back.
Is the Governor staying with his wife while he's back in Chicago?
And if not, why not?
Is it because the Florrick marriage is...?
What can I promise?
What do you need?
This week. Peter's here for the vote.
Folks, hold on, hold on.
You can rip me up later.
This Vice article is nonsense.
Nonsense?
Peter is back in Illinois this week
to veto the physician-assisted suicide bill.
And of course he'll be staying with his wife.
Ruth...
You're getting to alicia?
Right now.
I'm sure you're all aware, Peter's been spending
a lot of time in Iowa...
Alicia, can you call me as soon as you can?
The campaign needs to ask you a favor.
Ma'am, this just came in.
Thanks.
You miss it?
The pressure to bill hours, kowtow to clients,
And wrangle all the personalities?
The money?
The money never really materialized.
It always seemed to be somewhere over the horizon.
Yeah. I can see you here. Making clients wait.
Ordering associates around.
Being the queen bee bitch.
i'm a much calmer person now.
Oh, my god, that's a terrifying thought.
Shall we?
Sorry for our lateness.
Lucca Quinn and...
...Alicia florrick.
We've filed a substitution of attorney with the court.
We're representing Mr. Brewster now.
And we'll decamp here if that's all right.
That would be great. Please do.
Well, shall we start?
便捷科技能够以普通司机10倍的速度识别并规避危险
These are the laser ranging and detection units.
The car uses them to create a 3-d map of the street ahead.
To see and avoid any potential hazards.
On the front and rear bumper, there are three radar units.
They detect the speed of oncoming cars
And slow down if there are any obstacles.
And these are all redundant technologies?
Yes.
The t-portable has four layers of cross-referenced sensors.
It is by far the safest car on the road today.
No one has ever died or been injured
In any car accident caused by my t-port.
That would be news to my client.
That accident was not caused by my car.
It was caused by one of my employees,
Who took the car for an unauthorized test drive.
Which is why your client should not be suing me.
She should be suing that gentleman over there.
But I guess I have too deep a pocket.
Thank you, Mr. Ephraham. Your witness.
Is it legal to drive this car-- strike that.
Is it legal for this car to drive itself
In the state of Illinois?
No. But it is in Michigan.
That's nice. Why is it illegal in Illinois?
Well, some states want more data.
Unfortunately, data like this nuisance suit
won't help.
Well, it's unfortunate
that my client got in the way of your car's progress.
I didn't say that.
Ms. Searle's injury is unfortunate,
But it has nothing whatever to do with my car.
Technology can overcome most obstacles,
But it can't overcome human nature.
I have no further questions at this moment.
So why don't we take a break.
Actually,
we have a few questions.
Of course.
Good afternoon, mr. Ephraham.
Good afternoon.
In 2014 you told wired magazine
that the t-port had "The most advanced AI software
On the market. Every day it's learning something new."
What does that mean?
Each time the car is driven,
It learns something new about a-a street,
The, um, behavioral dynamics of other drivers, pedestrians,
The objects all around it.
So it gets smarter?
Yes.
Which means it isn't smart to begin with.
Well, it's pretty darn smart.
Yes.
But you yourself admit the software will learn.
So there must be something to be learned.
There's always something to be learned.
Because every situation on the road is unique?
Yes.
Actually, Mr. Ephraham,
Don't you mean that there might be
slight variations in a road encounter,
And that's all?
Yes, that's right.
Thanks, cary, for that correction.
And why is it important for the software to learn?
So it knows how to deal with all possible street encounters.
Which means it doesn't know how to deal with
all encounters now?
No.
I-I'm not trying to trick you, Mr. Ephraham.
If the software learns,
Then it must not know what it needs to learn, right?
Let's return to that.
Wendy, was it raining on the day of your accident?
It was. Fairly hard.
Mr. Ephraham, is rain one of those road conditions
That the t-port needs to learn how to negotiate?
It knows How to negotiate rain.
And yet weren't there two accidents on your test track during a rainstorm?
There were A lot of accidents on the test track.
That's why we call it a test track.
The software was still learning?
Right.
As it is now?
Why don't We take a break there.
I'm being ganged up on.
I've got lawyers crawling all over me
because you two lost me Tim.
We didn't lose him, sir.
He exercised his right to find another lawyer.?
Watch out, Or I might, too.
What do you think?
I think we're treating Alicia like an enemy
when we should be treating her like a free agent.
Very well played in there.
Thank you.
They'll probably be coming after Wendy next,
So we should talk.
We just did.
Lucca quinn.
Tell me if it's too strong.
So, this must be serious.
I mean, we're in your kitchen.
yeah, well...
No, no, it's just, I, um,
I was wanting to see how you...
liked it here.
Here, at your work?
Yeah.
I like it.
How am I doing?
Great.
Well, good, we're both great.
I feel like you want to say something.
No, I...
It's just...
the insurance here,
um, I have to, you know, get my ducks in a row.
Hold on.
Here.
Thanks.
I, um, wanted to see if you could sign this
for me.
It's just a standard
release for liability reasons.
Mm, in case I beat someone up?
No, just in case anything.
You know, you... trip on my stairs.
Or... cut yourself.
On an ice tray.
I hate doing it.
But, um, the insurance is expensive
and it cuts down on cost.
And if I don't sign it?
If you don't...
Well, why wouldn't you sign it?
I don't like signing things.
Well, the-the problem is that we're not a big firm,
So this is, this is just...
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Did that seem untrusting?
No.
I get it.
You're running a business.
Thanks again.
Would you like...?
What?
Would I like...?
Would you like to have dinner?
I-I have pizza.
Pizza sounds good.
Good.
I don't have pizza.
I have mini tacos.
Mini tacos sound good.
All right, let me just check the expiration.
Good, we're good!
One minute-- that's just the laundry.
Hey, thanks for doing this.
Hey, thanks for doing this.
Doing what?
Letting me stay here.
Eli didn't call?
No. Or he may have...
I'm Jason.
Hey, I'm Peter.
Uh, Jason is my new investigator.
I don't recall you mentioning anything about an investigator.
She tries to do most of the work herself.
Uh-huh, yeah, that sounds like my wife.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
You've been a great Governor.
Thank you, thank-thank you very much.
You know what? I-I should go.
No, no, don't leave on my account.
Got to get back to work.
Excuse me, Governor?
As do I. Donor calls.
Half my job is fund-raising.
I can imagine.
We'll talk, right?
Always.
Good to meet you, Jason.
Eli Gold.
Oh, finally you decided to return my...
Alicia, wait.
Alicia, I called you ten times.
Ali-alicia, can I call you back?
Um, wait, wait!
It-it's only until Friday.
Yeah, okay, bye, bye-bye.
Nora, Nora. Come here, quick!
Come on!
What?
Who was that that went into Ruth's office?
I have no idea.
Was that Courtney Paige?
Who's Courtney Paige?
HRT industries.
Only One of the most powerful CEOs in America.
Never heard of her.
Well, go in there and see if it's really her.
And... how am I supposed to do that?
Offer them water or something.
See if there's a scar on her hand.
You're joking.
No. She got into a paragliding accident.
I don't get paid enough.
Go. Go. My god.
I'm tired of being burned.
I've come to suspect passion.
I supported John Edwards.
Yes, I know.
But I can assure you the Florrick marriage is solid.
I brought you some water
in case you were thirsty.
Thank you, Nora.
Uh, Peter and Alicia's marriage
has survived the test of both time and tumult.
And they have come out the stronger.
Well, I'm no prude.
I'm just tired of seeing democratic candidates
sidelined by personal failings.
Nora, do you mind?
Seriously, Eli?
Did you see a scar?
I couldn't see.
Well, get back in there and see if it's her.
I have an MBA from Syracuse.
I graduated Summa Cum Laude
and I spent a year at the Sorbonne studying French poetry.
I'm done playing I Love Lucy for you.
But...
Eli?
Uh, just a minute.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Courtney Paige. Hello.
Eli Gold. I've followed
your career closely, Ms. Paige.
Oh, that's a terrifying thought.
Courtney's looking for a candidate to support.
Someone new and fresh.
I like underdogs.
Who doesn't?
But she's worried about the Florrick marriage.
I said you could comfort her fears.
Yes. Here I am...
to comfort.
I'd like to meet with them together at some point.
Well, uh, how about later this week?
Yes, yes. Uh... Uh, for the birthday party.
Whose birthday?
Is it Grace's birthday?
I have no idea.
Well, then why did you say it?
I don't know.
It just popped out. I'll talk to Alicia.
What's so important, Eli?
March. Why?
I have no words.
No. You can keep talking,
But I have no words for this.
You've had your fair share of accidents over the years,
haven't you, Ms. Searle?
Well, what do you mean?
It means they're blaming the victim.
You were found at fault in an accident in 2010
and then in 2012.
Yes, but that was different than this.
Also, your driver's license indicates that you wear corrective lenses.
But you weren't wearing corrective lenses
on the night of the accident?
No, but...?
Thank you.
Do you want to take this or should I?
Let me.
Wendy, um, you said, "No, but..."
to Ms. Lockhart's last question. Um,
What was your full answer going to be?
No, but I don't need the contact lenses for driving.
Good, thank you. And on the night of the accident,
were you texting while driving?
Was I...
Excuse me?
Were you texting on the night of the accident
while driving?
I... not while driving.
Well, I have a text sent from you...
12 P.M. That's less than 20 seconds before the accident.
Nice job blaming the victim.
Watch it.
You used to be a nicer person, you know.
Good thing your place is so quiet.
Not a lot of luck in finding T-port accidents.
The car is pretty damn safe.
That's too bad.
And yet?
Two things.
A month before the accident they added
a fuzzy driving feature to the software.
A what?
Fuzzy driving--
They found that the car obeyed traffic laws a little too well.
It would stop at a four-way stop and let
all the other cars keep going through,
because it was supposed to wait for them to come to a complete stop.
So, essentially, it never moved.
The car was too safe?
Right.
So Ephraham added the fuzzy driving feature.
Made the car more aggressive,
more human.
It would roll through stop signs.
It would be more aggressive when changing lanes.
So they made it... less safe?
Could argue that.
That's a pretty good argument.
What's the second thing?
The hard drive was erased...
after the accident.
What?
I tried to download a record of the accident from the T-Port.
There was nothing there.
Somebody erased the hard drive.
Really?
Mr. Hallman.
Hello. May I help you?
Is your house always like this?
No, this is unusual.
Um... Would you like to sit down?
I want you to stop being a stooge.
I'm-I'm not sure...
You're Landau's stooge on the board.
You're voting with him, and he's a corrupt son of a bitch.
Mr. Hallman, whatever your issues are with Mr. Landau...
My issue isn't with Mr. Landau. He's beyond saving.
But you're not.
I'm bringing this up for another vote this week.
Then I'm gonna ask Landau to stand down
and nominate you to take the chair.
You... What?
There are enough votes to put a woman in charge.
Everybody's been feeling the pressure from their home districts...
Mr. Hallman, I just...
But I need you to vote against KLT.
Then I can make you chair.
But I don't want to be chair.
Mrs. Florrick...
Corruption doesn't start out there.
It doesn't start in D.C. Or Springfield.
It starts here, in you and me,
and only if we let it happen, so don't.
It's as easy as that.
Just don't.
...Safe gap left by the T-Port.
This accident was not caused by fuzzy driving.
But fuzzy driving makes the car drive more like a human, right?
Yes. Like a safe human
that still follows the traffic laws.
But not in the case of keeping a safe two-car distance on the freeway.
Wait a minute. Stop ganging up here.
The only reason we added that feature is because human drivers
kept dangerously merging into the safe gap
left by the T-Port.
That's why the T-Port has been more aggressive.
In other words, that's why it tailgates?
Objection. He didn't say that.
No. Not tailgates.
Look, its human drivers are the ones making roads more dangerous.
Th-the t-port is just adapting.
By being more aggressive, by being more human,
Which resulted in this accident.
No. This accident was caused by humans.
Then why did you erase the car's hard drive?
I did not erase the hard drive.
Then how did it get erased?
Why don't we take a break?
No, I'd like to answer that.
The hard drive was damaged by the force of the accident.
We're not talking about an airplane's black box here.
It is vulnerable to impact.
That's not true.
You've had several other accidents--
Never has there been any data loss.
Yes, but that was a real-world...
Excuse me.
Mr. Brewster's being deposed now.
So, if the accident didn't erase the hard drive, how'd it happen?
Obviously somebody deliberately erased the data after the fact.
No.
Excuse me. Who are you?
Anthony Edward Dudewitz.
And what this... engineer is suggesting is complete balderdash.
If you don't mind, Mr. Dudewitz...
I do mind. I do mind mediocrity.
It has a taint, like burned toast,
and you stink of it.
All right, let me just tell you, Mr. Dudewitz
is the original developer of the T-Portable.
He is here as my next witness. I didn't know he'd be here.
Anthony.
What? Thief, bungler.
I'll testify if he's gone.
So you work with Mr. Ephraham?
Work?
Yes, I work with the great Charles Ephraham.
He handles the money; I handle the genius.
And what was your specific involvement with the T-Portable?
I designed the interface.
I hired most of these monkeys. Like that idiot.
Let the record reflect I am nodding to
the code monkey sitting over there.
Am I boring you?
Oh, far from it. I can't wait to return.
So, regarding the hard drive,
you said it couldn't have been manually erased?
Not without leaving some electronic trace.
There is no connection between the designer of the voting machines,
KLT, and Frank Landau.
But...?
How do you know there's a "but"?
There's always a "but" with you.
But...
There is a connection between KLT
and a shell company called Pigster Union,
owned by none other than Frank Landau's wife.
Really?
And why is this important?
No reason. Just... Something.
Um, hey, I'm really sorry about last night with Peter.
Why? Cool guy.
"Cool"?
Yeah.
You still owe me mini tacos, by the way.
I'll get right on that.
Hey, one other thing.
This guy...
Dudewitz? Yeah?
Yeah,
I've seen him on TED Talk.
You might want to ask him something.
TED Talk? Really?
Yeah. What's wrong?
No, no, you just...
You don't seem like the TED Talk kind of guy.
Ah. I'm an insomniac.
You'd be surprised what I get into late at night.
Does that answer your question?
Can I make it even simpler for you?
Tell me if these words get too complicated.
No. I'm good.
So the hard disk could not have been erased?
Yep. Can I go now?
Um, actually, just a few questions from me, Mr. Dudewitz.
Ah, you. You're back. We've been having fun in here.
I'm glad.
I guess you devised the fuzzy driving software for the T-Port?
Yes. You are correct in your guess.
And I imagine
this is the very definition of A.I., artificial intelligence?
How sweet.
You helpfully explained what A.I. means.
You are again correct in your imagination.
Mr. Dudewitz, what do you think of the future of A.I.?
Objection. Speculation.
It's a proper objection, even in a deposition.
I'll rephrase. What do you think of A.I.?
What do you want to know? Just ask.
Are we in danger from A.I.?
I think it's getting smarter.
Every day. Learning our boundaries and its boundaries--
It's evolving.
I think there will be an adjustment period after it takes over,
but eventually...
Wait, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Um, what do you mean by "takes over"?
The Singularity.
When the system is capable of recursive self-improvement,
when it is better at recalibrating,
expanding and spawning than we are,
the brief blip of humanity's reign
will reach its inevitable conclusion.
So you're saying the robots are coming to get us?
No. I hear the ridicule in your voice, Ma'am.
I'm just saying they won't have much use for us.
Mr. Dudewitz, who else believes that A.I. has the potential to be dangerous?
Elon Musk, stephen Hawking, Bill Gates...
So this is not an unorthodox position?
Certainly it's unorthodox-- It's held by geniuses,
like myself.
The sheep are too busy watching TV.
Thank you, Cary. One last question.
How do you think the car's hard drive got erased?
Objection.
Speculation.
I-I'll rephrase.
Do you think that the car's...
capable of erasing its own memory?
Yes, I do.
And if you believe that,
don't you think that the software
could override the safety features?
I don't think I would go that far.
But if you believe that A.I.
can transcend its creators' original mission,
and you introduced the theory of fuzzy driving
in order to make the car more aggressive, more human-like,
then why couldn't the computer override your safety controls?
Come on, that has so many layers of hypotheticals and suppositions...
Hey, he's your witness, not mine.
Well,
I'm noting my objection for the record.
Mr. Dudewitz, do you have an answer for that?
I am a smart man.
A genius.
Yes, and I've created something so complex, I can't positively tell
what it can do and what it can't.
So it could have put that woman into a wheelchair?
It's possible.
Thank you, sir.
This has been most illuminating.
Hey, guys.
Well, we couldn't have gone this far without your support.
Well, thank you, Mr. Oliver. Thank you.
I deeply, deeply appreciate it.
Okay.
You, too.
Another fund-raising call?
Yeah. Well, it's a necessary evil.
But then, uh, you'd know about that.
Tequila?
You've graduated.
I am in a celebratory mood.
Oh? Good day in court?
There's nothing better than a good cross.
You?
Well, that was $1 million.
Things are clicking.
I like when things click.
You're okay in the bonus room?
Yeah.
Feels like old times.
Want to get laid?
Do you?
Sure. I've got 20 minutes.
Me, too.
Next stop, Lincoln Bedroom.
Think it's any different there?
Oh, yeah-- everybody gets laid there.
You think you have a shot?
I think Ruth thinks I have a shot...
if things go wrong with Hillary.
Or Bernie.
Zach's?
Yeah.
This all right?
Are you planning on making noise?
Just in case.
No.
That's another million dollars.
Which do you want more?
Where's Peter?
Sleeping.
Peter?
Peter, I have a call.
Be right out.
So you're all right with this?
Peter, I basically seduced you.
You don't have to call me in the morning.
Yeah, it was sexy, huh?
It's always sexier not to care.
Why is that?
Because sex is sexier without love.
Yeah?
I have Mrs. Blumen on the line.
She... wants to give money,
but she wants to talk to you.
Give it to me.
Mrs. Blumen, hello.
How you doing, Eli?
I'm... not sure.
Oh. You catching a cold?
No. No.
You're being smart, aren't you?
Always.
So, if you were driving
at 35 miles per hour, Mr. Brewster,
you had seven seconds to switch out of driverless mode
and hit the brakes?
But that wasn't my responsibility.
But isn't that part of why you were in the car?
To step in if it malfunctioned?
Objection.
Miss characterizes earlier testimony.
Your objection is preserved for judge.
All I did was turn on the defroster.
And then, a few seconds later, the lights started flashing,
the radio starts flipping stations.
It was like the car had a mind of its own.
So, were you asleep at the switch?
Excuse me. One interrogator at a time, please.
But were you asleep at the switch?
I was not asleep.
I never actually fell asleep.
Actually asleep? Okay, good.
Were you dozing?
The car is supposed to drive itself.
So you were dozing?
Maybe when you were asleep,
you accidentally disengaged the driverless mode, and...
Objection. He already said he wasn't sleeping.
This isn't deposition by ambush.
He's either going to answer our questions
one at a time or altogether. It's his choice.
So you were asleep at the switch?
Right now, I'm in full control,
but we can go driverless at any time.
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Dudewitz.
I don't like thank yous.
They're a remnant of a hypocritical society.
Ready to go driverless?
Let's do it.
I can now read, shave, yodel.
The car is driving itself?
Yup. I just put into
the GPS the intersection where the crash happened.
Oh. Okay, that kid?
That kid could be the next Steve Jobs.
The car just saved his life.
You're welcome, kid.
Okay.
We're in the proximity of where the accident happened.
What did you do then?
Nothing. I just sat.
What was that?
A pothole.
So, you said you hit the defroster. When was that?
Uh, just before this next intersection.
Now.
The defroster. And...
Nothing.
All right, what'd you do after you turned on the defroster?
I turned it off.
And a few seconds later, the lights started flashing,
the radio turned on,
and all the windows rolled down.
You're wrong.
I'm just telling you what happened.
Maybe your memory is faulty.
There's no way the A.I. Has control over the windows.
Look, it was cold outside.
The windows rolled down.
Maybe you bumped into the controls.
I did not.
Mr. Dudewitz.
If Tim... didn't misremember if the windows did roll down,
how could that happen?
It couldn't have. Whenever I see an equation
and it doesn't add up, I know where the problem lies.
It's with humans.
It's always with humans.
And is the only human in this equation Tim?
If he was the only one in the car, if he was...
Yeah?
There could be another human involved.
Not one in the car.
Who?
A hacker.
R.L. Burnside?
It's all his hits.
I have read biographies galore,
books on philosophy, but I... I find
that all of life's biggest questions can be answered
by that CD.
This is great.
Thank you so much.
So when is your actual birthday?
The 14th.
Remember that blues club
we went to in, uh, Georgetown? Monique's?
Oh, yeah. It's probably gone now.
Yeah. Believe it or not,
this sophisticated lady you see sitting there
got on top of the bar and started dancing with her friends.
Mom? You did?
I was 22, and, of course, I tripped.
And fell into my arms, throwing up on my back.
Oh, God, you were such a baby.
So, Ms. Paige, did you really
tell the king of Saudi Arabia
to start letting more women into the workplace?
I did indeed, although I did it politely.
How did he respond?
Oh, exactly how I thought he would.
He, uh, smiled and asked me to pass the lamb.
She was supposed to leave 30 minutes ago.
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one.
It's good-- they like each other.
Everything's going great.
Oh, Mr. Gold.
Oh, dear God, what are you doing here, Jackie?
Ms. Eastman, how are you?
Hello.
This is Howard.
Eli, Ruth.
How do you do?
Hi.
Uh, Peter and Alicia are having a dinner party
for Ruth-- f-for Grace.
Yes, I know, that's why we're here.
We have something to tell them.
It's actually not a good time right now, Jackie.
It's always a good time to see my son, Mr. Gold.
What can happen?
So what was it like growing up in Texas?
Hello!
Mother? What a surprise.
You call that standing guard?
A man has got to know his limitations,
and your mother is mine.
Oh, what is this? A party?
Yes, it's my birthday party.
But your birthday isn't until...
We're celebrating a little early this year, Jackie.
Yes, we're... gonna celebrate now.
Oh, well, well,
how nice... and how... early.
Ms. Paige, this is my mother Jackie Florrick and her, uh...
Her, uh... Howard Lyman.
A pleasure, ma'am.
Oh, the pleasure's all mine.
I-I like Peter's African-American friends.
Jackie, do you have a minute out here?
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Well, yes, but first, uh, I have some news.
We have some news.
Let's share that news later.
Howard and I... are engaged.
Are you insane, Mom?!
We're in love.
Grandma, I'm so happy for you!
Mother? Mother, you...?
This is not a good idea.
It is, Peter, and I'm so happy.
Who would have thought we'd find love at this age?
Guess this makes me
Stepfather-General.
That's wonderful. Congratulations.
Yes, wonderful indeed.
I'm sure you'll want to resume your celebration out in the hall.
But doesn't anyone want to hear how he proposed?
No.
Oh, yes!
Please.
Well, first of all, Howard took me
to this lovely dinner at Tournesol.
So, you were in Selma during the march?
Yeah, I was there for a deposition.
Uh, even got to meet the man himself, Dr. King.
Really?
Mm.
Told him to speed things up.
Couldn't get to my car.
So-so what brings you here?
You want a drink?
Yeah.
Or a gun.
Oh, just give up, Eli.
Bad things happen or they don't.
But there's just too much craziness in the world.
Like you and Peter?
The old me would be provoked by that statement.
But the new me... just doesn't care.
So, yes... like me and Peter.
Well, we'd better get going.
We're meeting friends downtown.
Oh, Peter, dear, will you get my things?
No. Allow me.
He's so chivalrous.
It was so nice spending time with you, Ms. Paige.
You are an inspiration to all urban children.
Thank you.
Uh, don't beat yourself up.
I don't know the first thing about wines.
Ms. Paige, hello.
Uh, Courtney.
And I still am a Houston girl.
My drink of choice-- any soda with the word "Cherry" in it.
This was a disaster tonight, wasn't it?
No. I like, um... reality.
Well, you got a lot of that tonight.
Don't worry so much.
You're the second person to tell me that tonight.
Well, then it must be true.
I got it.
What are you doing?
What am I...?
Are.... are you asking what am I doing here?
With Craig Hallman?
What are you doing with Craig Hallman?
Mr. Landau, I'm a bit tired.
I know he's pushing for a new vote.
I know he was here.
Yes, and I know that your wife is
a part owner of KLT.
He tell you that?
No.
Are you gonna vote against me?
Mr. Landau, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can hurt you.
I can hurt Peter.
Gentlemen,
I think this man has something to say to you.
I don't mean physically.
You can recover from being physically hurt.
Oh, look, just stop it, Frank.
Let me vote the way I want to.
Think about this.
Your new little friend, Hallman, is part owner of Swan Systems.
Nobody's innocent here.
So you either vote for me or him.
Good luck with that.
So, could the T-Port be hacked?
T-Portable, and yes.
I thought you said that was impossible.
Is that an objection?
What I said was, it was impossible
for the car to be hacked
without the hacker leaving a trace.
The only time the car is vulnerable
is when it goes into computer update.
Someone could plant a virus while it was happening,
and no one would notice.
So, you're saying the hack came from inside the company?
Yes.
That's what I'm saying. I did a search.
Mr. Brewster, the idiot coder over there,
had idiot coder friends, all idiot coders, too,
and they all eat at Acapulco,
and they all smell like elephants at the circus.
Mr. Dudewitz.
They hacked the T-Portable
hard drive before he took the car out.
They wanted to play with him?
That's right. Humans
always there to disappoint.
They wanted to spook him, but they crashed his car
into your car, ma'am, I'm sorry to say.
And then they covered their tracks?
Yes, they wiped the hard drive.
I hope you have enough insurance
to cover this, Charles.
You're pretty happy about this?
It's just money.
One less horse for your homestead.
Thank you, Mr. Dudewitz.
Can I leave now?
I was just coming to see you.
I'm so glad.
Shall we?
It's-it's being cleaned.
Just wanted to thank you for inviting me to the Florricks'.
No problem. I'm sorry it was so, uh... eventful.
I like events.
No reason to apologize to me for that.
So what do you think?
Of Peter and Alicia?
I thought they were boring.
Oh. Like a real married couple.
I'm gonna back Peter.
Good.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You have constantly...
That's
the only reason why we're in complete disagreement.
...been acting as a gadfly with only one interest. Imagine if the rest...
That's stopping this board from moving forward.
Imagine if the rest of the board was...- You're obsessed...
Any other discussion?
Mrs. Florrick,
do you have any discussion about this very important issue?
Would you like me to have some?
I would like you to speak for yourself.
I think that the two of you... have issues.
That may be true, but you still have to vote on it.
The election board either has to renew its license
with KLT and its voting machines,
or reject it and license with Swan.
All those for Swan,
raise your hands.
All those against?
Mrs. Florrick?
