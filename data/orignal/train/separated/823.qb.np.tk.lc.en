in a bra over a t @-@ shirt
holding a sign that says &quot; property of pete . &quot;
not a sext .
i &apos;m wearing a bra !
no , that &apos;s like a glorified selfie .
you can see the bra .
nope . i bet he saw this ,
and he was like ,
&quot; oh , delicious . &quot;
you want him to say that ?
i have to agree ,
because the true nature
of eroticism is what is not shown .
i never get sexts .
what are you taking ?
just some , uh ... motion sickness pill .
it &apos;s a mild sedative .
my mom just landed .
that &apos;s unrelated .
oh , my god , your mom &apos;s here ? !
i &apos;m so excited to meet her .
you probably won &apos;t ; she &apos;s busy .
but maybe , hopefully , i doubt it .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;ve never met her .
you know , we get together and we laugh and ...
she tells me all the ways that
i could be better at things ,
and then i do them ,
but not right .
oh , it &apos;s fun .

a motorcycle accident ? i didn &apos;t even know pete rode one .
he didn &apos;t . apparently , he was thinking about getting one ,
and he slipped and fell on the showroom floor .
buffed floors ...
beautiful , but at what cost ?
the first guy i sext dies .
i should go to the memorial , right ?
jess , don &apos;t make this about yourself , all right ?
you went on two dates with the guy .
i was one of the last people to text him .
on earth .
look , you didn &apos;t even
have sex with him , okay ? you &apos;re fine .
so if i &apos;d slept with him , i &apos;d go .
or if you &apos;d gone skiing together .

that &apos;s great , you know .
i don &apos;t feel very comfortable when i &apos;m around her .
well , boo @-@ hoo , she thinks you want to have sex with her .

who else would represent
nfl star j.j. watt ?
uh , pete was my best friend and , uh ...
god , it &apos;s good to see you .
wouldn &apos;t the couch be better over there ?
all that light ?
or do you like to live like a radish , underground ?
so we worked really hard on the ... on the cards .
let &apos;s see what we got .
okay .
but you know what would be better ?
connie &apos;s into gardening .
you should mention that .
and if you really want your card to pop ,
you can use a nice fountain pen
on silver stationery .
and you should sign your full name , not just schmidt .
i mean , you have a lovely first name .
great ! i &apos;ll just make all those changes , mom !
okay .
you &apos;re not getting me into your pants , you little jackhammer .
oh , i don &apos;t want you in my pants , louise .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so then pete says to ...
allen iverson .
you want to keep sportsing on the ...
grizzlies .
but if you want me
to show you the money , then ...
you gotta finish your career off with the &apos; 76ers ! &quot;
and it was classic pete .
it &apos;s so nice to remember work as more than just a thing
that kept pete on the phone all the time .
you &apos;re very welcome .
oh , val , you should have pete &apos;s phone .
all those memories and photos ...
it &apos;s in the garage with all his stuff .
i &apos;ll give it to you before you go .
thank you .
okay , we gotta find that phone before val sees the sext .
yes , it is the right thing to do .
like i &apos;ve said all along . i got a good thing going
with j.j. and i &apos;m not gonna let you ruin it .
that &apos;s the funeral spirit .
what are you guys doing in here ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m looking for pete &apos;s phone .
so are we ! did you sext him , too ?
no . i fired pete over text ,
so i didn &apos;t want to crush his family .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m at the memorial .
not because it was the right thing to do ?
no . no . i mean , we never even went skiing .
who makes up these rules ?
now ...
what are you guys doing out here ?
singing .
s ... what ?
we like to sing .
together . about ...
sports .
food .
sports foods .
that &apos;s fun .
it &apos;s ...
would you guys ...
would it be putting you on the spot if i asked you to do one ?
i think that wouldn &apos;t be appropriate .
actually , yes .
i feel like it &apos;s a little ...
* hot dogs *
* hot dogs *
* everybody loves hot dogs *
* hot dogs *
* dogs *
* everybody &apos;s favorite treat is hot dogs *
* hot dogs *
* pretzels *
whoa , partner !
wait up !
that work @-@ style thing was pretty fun .
let &apos;s parlay that into a beer .
my buddy has a bar he works at , down the street .
it &apos;s carpeted , so ...
bishop , what don &apos;t you get ?
no .
are you okay ?
oh , hey , man . thanks .
yeah , i don &apos;t know , man . it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;m talking to a ladybug .
squeeze my hand !
just one more push ! you &apos;re almost there !
the first child is always the hardest !
hey , bud .
hard candy ?
is it butterscotch ?
no , &apos; cause we &apos;re friggin &apos; strangers .
&quot; is it butterscotch ? &quot;
so , you freaked out a little back there , didn &apos;t you ?
not to use some popsicle psychology ...
&quot; popsicle psychology &quot; ?
yeah , it &apos;s pop psychology for short .
&apos;cause , you know , you eat the popsicle and you love it so much
and then you &apos;re stuck holding the @-@ the stick ?
you get it . you get it .
not really , but ...
i think you have some pent @-@ up resentment towards your mom .
she &apos;s trying to control you !
she treats you like a little baby
who can &apos;t do anything for himself .
that &apos;s why i never wrote the cards in the first place .
go tell that to your mom !
she &apos;ll understand .
i don &apos;t understand .
the couch looks good here though , doesn &apos;t it ?
it opens up the whole room .
louise , i think what your boy is trying to say is ...
shut it , nick .
honey , why do you hang out with him ?
you know nancy borkow ?
her son just moved to l.a.
he wrote a movie script for the movies .
i can connect you . you need better friends !
enough , mom !
you don &apos;t get to choose my friends !
you don &apos;t get to choose anything !
because this is my life !
it &apos;s my dream and nothing &apos;s gonna stop me now !
it feels like that &apos;s from something .
it feels like ,
* my life *
it feels like it &apos;s from a movie or something .
yeah , i think it &apos;s a song .
like some sort of song , right ?
it &apos;s a song .
it &apos;s the perfect stranger theme .
well , you know , it doesn &apos;t matter !
you know , we did a good job with those cards , mom .
and we don &apos;t need any of your money .
whoa , we &apos;re all being very emotional .
let &apos;s just slow everything ...
i &apos;m moving the couch back !
gosh !
did you nail that thing down ?
that &apos;s ... you move that all by yourself ?
i &apos;m an adult man , mom .
and nick is my best friend in the whole wide world .
and we &apos;re gonna buy a small portion of that bar
without any of your help .
and also , there &apos;s some leftover chili in the fridge
if you get hungry , and , please , make sure
to put a plate over it before you put it in the microwave .
i don &apos;t want it to splatter everywhere !
* and that &apos;s why they call it *
* the out @-@ of @-@ peanuts *
* blues *
* stadium taco *
thank you guys for being a bright spot on my sad day .
shucks !
sorry !
i thought i saw pete &apos;s ghost !

is that a crime in california ? what happened ?
i got dragged to a random dude &apos;s funeral .
who dragged you ?
my friend . she always thinks
she knows what &apos;s best .
who &apos;s your friend-- me ?
no .
i got accused of that today by my son .
he &apos;s tired of me babying him .
but he &apos;s my baby , so what am i supposed to do ?
maybe you have to let go a little .
this is why strangers talk .
you &apos;re a genius .
want to see a picture of my son ? he &apos;s handsome .
nah . i &apos;m kind of in love with my ex , so ...
all right , you can &apos;t date him anyway .
you &apos;re not jewish ,
so over my dead body and all that .
today was not a win for me .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
well , you made today about yourself .
not to use popcorn psychology , but it &apos;s human nature .
you know ? soon as i saw j.j. walk in , i was , like ,
&quot; j.j. watt , be my best friend . &quot;
i got to do something .
should i tell aly off ? uh ...
put in for a new partner ?
what &apos;s the right thing to do here ?

i learned from the best .
that &apos;s awesome .
what a wonderful moment we &apos;re having today !
you know what ? i &apos;ll figure it out myself .

this is from that sixth grader over there .
aly , what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to explain . look ...
i hung out a lot with my last partner .
and we got close and ...
you shot him ?
what ?
he died ?
no .
oh , my goodness ... is he ... ?
did he survive ?
what are you talking about ?
how did you partner die ?
he didn &apos;t die !
so , what &apos;s your point ?
he just fell in love with me !
oh ... oh ! oh !
yeah .
and it messed everything up .
and i just don &apos;t want that to happen again .
damn , you &apos;re conceited !
don &apos;t nobody want your babies .
i know that now !
i mean , you brought me to your loft
and showed me a bar mitzvah video .
friends ?
cool , cool .
just , uh ... don &apos;t go falling in love with me .
&apos;cause i &apos;m lovable as hell .
okay .

i just think you &apos;d be more of a success socially
if you let people come to you .

i &apos;m not gonna be able to sleep until we &apos;re best friends .
nick , can you believe it ?
you &apos;re a bar owner .

the other 90 % of the bar , right ?
y @-@ yes .
