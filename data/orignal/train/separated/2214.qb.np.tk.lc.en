it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love you .
i do .
but i have to go away for a little bit .
how long ?
the truth is i don &apos;t really know .
so you &apos;re going back to afghanistan ?
no . nepal .
if you leave today ,
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t wait for you .
not anymore .
i &apos;ll always ... always love you .
where are you ?
on my way .
what about your cover ?
he didn &apos;t question it .
are you sure you can do this , lieutenant ?
absolutely .
hello .
hello .
what makes you think it was catherine ?
well , it was an international number ,
but there was no country code ,
which means the call probably came from a satellite phone .
plus i got two other calls just like it recently .
detective williams .
yeah .
i &apos;m special agent kang with the fbi .
you and your brother are close .
in fact , you were the last person to see matt
before he fled the country .
with all the resources at your disposal
as a member of five @-@ 0,
you &apos;d have done everything in your power
to locate and assist your brother .
this is definitely not about my brother .
this is about me , this is about five @-@ 0,
this is about the people that i work with .
am i right ?
it &apos;s okay . don &apos;t answer .
you .
you got something you want to ask me ,
just come on out , ask me , okay ?
this isn &apos;t going anywhere .
maybe not .
but this task force has crossed the line before .
and they will again .
you just need to be there when it happens .
yes , sir .
ems responding to pedestrian versus auto .
25 @-@ year @-@ old male . bp 140 / 90 .
tachy at 160 .
eta two minutes .
ok , what are we looking at ?
about 14 hours in this guy .
so cancel your dinner plans .
patient is a 24 @-@ year @-@ old male .
broken femur , one cracked rib .
patient &apos;s bleeding internally from a ruptured femoral artery .
thank you .
so you &apos;re the new pro they brought in from the mainland .
long way from cleveland general .
welcome to paradise .
okay , i &apos;m good .
ready when you are .
then let &apos;s get going . scalpel .
so this is the guy who &apos;s after us ?
yeah .
who is he ?
he &apos;s federal prosecutor robert coughlin .
coughlin ?
coughlin .
yeah , he &apos;s rex &apos;s brother .
recently transferred here from boston .
how do we know him ?
rex coughlin was an ia detective
who investigated me a few years back .
what for ?
cash that went missing from the evidence room .
which chin was exonerated for .
and then more recently , he accused me of protecting
gabriel waincroft .
so what you &apos;re saying is you had no idea
that you gave a free ride to the kid
who would become a ruthless cartel drug lord ?
all i knew was that two years after my dad died ,
gabriel told malia that he was leaving
to take a construction job on the mainland .
did you or your wife have any contact with gabriel after that ?
malia stayed in contact with him for a few years ,
but , over time , it was just too hard to get a hold of him .
so you &apos;re telling us you neither saw nor heard from him
after he left for this so @-@ called job off the island .
yes , that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
the whole thing was a witch hunt .
in coughlin &apos;s eyes , i was guilty until proven innocent .
he was so desperate to bring chin down ,
he made a deal with the devil to do it .
what do you mean ?
rex cut a deal with gabriel ,
in exchange for gabriel agreeing to testify against chin .
right , but while the deal was still being hammered out ,
rex made the mistake of having gabriel
temporarily transferred out of halawa .
it &apos;s all there , just as we agreed .
all it needs is your signature .
so what do we do about this guy ?
well , first of all , we need to figure out
if this is an official investigation
or just a personal vendetta .
if it is an investigation ,
robert &apos;s gonna have people working for him , right ?
we need to figure out who they are .
mcgarrett .
all right . we &apos;re on our way .
talk to me , duke .
got three dead : two hospital staff and one patient .
three more seriously injured , including the real surgeon
who was found unconscious in the doctors &apos; lounge .
operating theory is that this was a hit .
the guy on the table was the intended target .
everybody else was just collateral .
so who &apos;s this guy ?
tommy luana , age 25 , unemployed , no family .
all right , it says here that he was struck
by a vehicle this evening .
is there any possibility that wasn &apos;t an accident ?
not a chance .
why you say that ?
&apos;cause it was one of our patrol cars that hit him .
one of ours ?
luana just ran right in front of it .
nobody knows why .
officer behind the wheel tried to stop ,
but it was impossible to avoid the collision .
all right , what else do we know about this guy
that could tell us why somebody wants him dead ?
not much .
but you might be interested to know that he was booked
on a 5 a.m. flight to hong kong .
we found the boarding pass in his patient &apos;s belonging pouch .
well , those travel plans
are either the world &apos;s biggest coincidence ,
or luana knew somebody was after him , tried to get out of town .
duke , was there a cell phone in that pouch too ?
yeah .
all right , let &apos;s get that down to the lab right away ,
see what they can pull off it .
copy that .
all right , max , what do you got ?
well , in the case of mr. luana ,
it appears the c.o.d. was asphyxiation .
the killer elected to simply just disconnect his ventilator .
and left unattended , he quickly expired .
well , at least the guy died peacefully .
there is something quite puzzling though .
please note the four @-@ inch incision along the abdomen .
according to the nurse &apos;s report , this wound was sutured
when mr. luana first entered the o.r. ,
which suggests that he recently underwent surgery ,
however , you can see that ...
killer opened him back up .
now , why the hell would they do that ?
i have no idea .
however , x @-@ rays would probably have been taken
when mr. luana was first admitted to the hospital .
perhaps those images can tell us something .
what is that ?
it appears that until the time of his murder ,
mr. luana had a small object implanted near his abdomen ,
just below the surface of his skin .
well , add that up with his travel arrangements ,
i &apos;d say mr. luana was some kind of a mule .
this wasn &apos;t a hit , it was a robbery .
the question is : what was this guy carrying inside of his body ...
that was worth taking out a whole room full of people ?
we weren &apos;t supposed to meet for another 72 hours .
yeah , well , couldn &apos;t wait .
clearly .
okay , so what &apos;s going on ?
five @-@ o knows about you .
yeah , well , i suppose that was inevitable .
the important thing is they can &apos;t know about you .
they don &apos;t .
but they &apos;re smart , they &apos;ll figure it out soon enough .
only if you slip up .
and i have faith that won &apos;t happen .
inspector , this changes nothing .
you just keep doing what you &apos;re doing , and sooner or later ,
we &apos;re gonna get something solid on these people .
uh , no , i don &apos;t think so .
why &apos;s that ?
i &apos;ve been under for months now , and i haven &apos;t seen anything
to warrant disbanding or indicting members of five @-@ 0 .
any of them .
yes , they &apos;re aggressive ,
but they stay in bounds .
&quot; stay in bounds &quot; ?
these guys keep moving the boundary
to where there &apos;s no line anymore .
this is a different country
than it was when this task force was created .
now , we &apos;re in a civil war .
the civilians versus anyone with a badge .
and @-@ and men like steve mcgarrett have helped
erode the trust between what we do and the people who need us .
then establish an oversight .
it &apos;s too late for that .
these people have operated by their own rules for too long now .
and in my experience , free reign leads to gross misconduct .
well , i haven &apos;t seen any .
are you sure your relationship with chin ho kelly
isn &apos;t clouding your judgment here ?
now , i understand it &apos;s gotten personal for you .
well , if you feel that way ,
why don &apos;t you pull me out ?
oh , i see . you &apos;ve got eyes on me .
in case i withhold intel , you still get it anyway .
well , once it got personal , i had no choice .
sir ?
with all due respect , this operation is a witch hunt .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re looking for anything to bring them down .
any speck of impropriety .
because this entire operation is all about your brother .
yeah .
i know about that .
and i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not gonna be a pawn in some personal vendetta .
i think your forgetting your place , inspector .
you &apos;re not the one calling the shots here .
now , this is what &apos;s gonna happen .
you &apos;re gonna go back to five @-@ 0,
and you will stay under until you get something .
is that clear ?
and if i refuse ?
you &apos;re , what-- gonna write me up for insubordination ?
when the san francisco pd agreed to participate
in this investigation ,
it was with the understanding
that you would be under my sole supervision .
wh @-@ which means you work for me .
so either you do your job ...
or you surrender your badge and gun .
your choice .
so , we &apos;re pretty sure this is our suspect .
she was seen entering the hospital about ten minutes
after tommy luana was brought in .
nice job dodging the cameras .
yeah .
i pulled every single angle .
eight cameras-- not one of them got a clear shot of her face .
here she is entering the doctor &apos;s lounge .
and there she is leaving .
now , this is where it gets interesting .
see this tattoo ?
yeah , it looks like a monarch butterfly .
mm @-@ hmm , now take a look at this .
this is dash @-@ cam footage from the patrol car
that hit luana .
it &apos;s about a minute after impact .
look at that .
same ink .
our suspect was at the scene .
mm @-@ hmm , not only that .
hpd canvas turned up a witness
who says she saw a woman in a hooded sweatshirt
running after luana right before he ran into oncoming traffic .
all right , i &apos;m thinking tommy luana
was trying to flag down the patrol car .
mm @-@ hmm , except he was reckless and got hit instead .
meanwhile , our suspect hangs around ,
finds out what hospital he &apos;s being brought to
and follows him there .
i already ran the tattoo through the hpd database ,
came up empty .
all right , so the lab just pulled location data
off of tommy luana &apos;s cell phone .
i think we may have a lead .
so yesterday afternoon ,
luana visited an herbal medicine shop in chinatown .
owner &apos;s name is david yang .
this guy used to be a big @-@ deal plastic surgeon ,
until about 20 years ago
when he got popped for selling oxycodone prescriptions
and lost his license .
but here &apos;s the interesting part .
yang &apos;s actually been on hpd &apos;s radar for a while ,
because the word is yang does backroom surgery for cash .
mostly underworld clientele .
so you &apos;re thinking that whatever was embedded inside of luana ,
that yang put it there .
yeah , luana can &apos;t just walk into a health clinic
and ask for that procedure .
all right , danny and i are gonna check out this dr. yang .
if we can find out what luana was carrying ,
it might help us i.d. our killer .
oh , boy .
what &apos;s with the eye roll ?
you got poop in a jar . &quot; what &apos;s with the eye roll &quot;
this is not poop .
this is black mushroom .
this is a , uh , this is a very , uh ...
it has a lot of healing properties .
this particular fungus .
hmm , i don &apos;t get how people buy into this new @-@ age science crap .
‭ i don &apos;t understand .
traditional chinese medicine
has @-@ has been around for centuries .
it &apos;s hardly new @-@ age science .
it &apos;s hardly science .
i don &apos;t know about that , actually .
i took some cat &apos;s claw once as a pain reliever .
it worked pretty good ,
almost as good as aspirin , i &apos;d say .
i @-@ i will stick with the aspirin .
and you can waste your money and time on this voodoo medicine
peddled by , uh , quacks .
dr. yang is no quack .
dr. yang is a healer
of the mind , the body and the soul .
dr. yang is also in big trouble
for implanting small foreign objects into people &apos;s bodies .
i think i should talk to my lawyer .
your lawyer ? what you want to do that for ?
we just want to have a friendly conversation .
tell me , do you , uh , recognize this guy ?
no .
nice try .
look . we know he came here .
we know he left with something implanted in his body .
we want to know what that something is .
doctor / patient privilege .
ask him .
well , he &apos;s unfortunately dead ,
so we can &apos;t ask him anything ,
unless maybe you got some magic potion
that can bring him back to life .
i &apos;m sorry . i really don &apos;t know anything about that .
look , we know you &apos;re not responsible .
all the same , i want to talk to my lawyer .
no , no .
trust me , you want to , you want to talk to us ,
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t talk to us ,
we are going to tell everybody , uh ,
that you are snitching for five @-@ o.
we &apos;re gonna put the word out on the street
that you &apos;ve given us the name of every single scumbag
that you ever stitched up in this place .
imagine what they &apos;ll do to you .
okay .
this guy needed a temporary implant .
all i did was the needle work .
what you implant ?
a flash drive .
yeah .
okay .
what was , what was on the flash drive ?
i don &apos;t know .
and i didn &apos;t ask .
all right , how &apos;d you guys hook up ?
he was sent here by another man .
a customer who had been here a few times before .
this man even paid for the job .
good , okay .
what , what was his name ?
chris dalton , 32 , no record .
according to linkedin ,
he &apos;s a cyber strategist at sillex labs .
it &apos;s a computer company with offices here on the island .
i &apos;m uploading the address to your gps now .
okay , question .
what &apos;s a cyber strategist ?
yes .
basically , his job is to protect
computer systems from hackers .
i also ran dalton &apos;s financials .
and in addition to the 5k he paid dr. yang ,
he also slipped ten to luana
and bought his plane ticket to hong kong .
and it looks like dalton was gonna follow him there , too ,
because he &apos;s booked on a flight
that leaves the day after tomorrow .
not anymore he &apos;s not .
you gonna keep looking at your watch every ten seconds ?
they said five minutes ten minutes ago , all right ?
um , th @-@ they said that .
gentlemen ?
gentlemen , i &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting .
i &apos;m elliot brenner .
unfortunately , mr. dalton is unavailable at the moment .
but he &apos;s here , well , you ,
well , you &apos;re gonna have to make him available .
well , he &apos;s in the middle of something very important .
can i ask what this is about ?
it &apos;s about a homicide that we &apos;re working .
and we think he &apos;s connected , so ...
we &apos;d like to see him .
he &apos;s in here .
open it .
yes , sir .
you keep him locked up ?
he &apos;s sequestered right now .
mr. dalton is currently the subject of an internal investigation .
what he do ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to talk about it .
guess chris didn &apos;t want to talk about it , either , huh ?
where &apos;s he park his car ?
over here .
how many ways in and out of this area ?
just one .
he &apos;s gone .
danny , get an alert out right away .
have kono and grover check dalton &apos;s house , all right ?
let &apos;s try this again .
what exactly did dalton do ?
our company manages computer systems for the nsa .
because dalton was on the account ,
he was given top @-@ level security clearance .
we believe he used it to download classified material .
what kind of material ?
black ops intel .
files on active non @-@ official cover agents .
we &apos;re not sure why or
what he planned to do with it .
we were about to question him when you guys showed up .
is there any chance that dalton could &apos;ve
put that information onto a flash drive ?
we &apos;re still running diagnostics on his hardware ,
but , yeah , that &apos;s the most likely scenario .
look , uh , this woman ?
she killed three people this morning ,
trying to get her hands on a flash drive
that dalton was trying to smuggle out of the country .
too late .
you need to contact your nsa liaison right now
and tell them exactly what happened .
this woman , she could be working alone
or she could be working for a foreign intelligence service .
either way , those agents are now compromised .
they need to be pulled out of the field immediately .
all right ?
you got it .
clear !
clear !
clear !
clear .
kono , help me out with something .
dalton &apos;s job is to safeguard
classified information , state secrets .
what would make him load all that stuff onto a flash drive
and try to sneak it out of the country ?
money .
america &apos;s got plenty of enemies .
maybe dalton was gonna sell
those secrets to the highest bidder .
all right , fine , everybody likes money .
but i don &apos;t know .
he looks like he &apos;s doing all right for himself .
and the guy seems to be a pretty patriotic guy .
look at him .
rotc .
he &apos;s flying an american flag at his front door .
he &apos;s a boy scout .
you actually think this guy is willing
to sell out his county for a couple of bucks ?
he might , if the price was right .
honestly , though , the bigger question is
how did our killer find out about the flash drive ?
well , perhaps the good dr. yang told her about it .
yang &apos;s gotta figure this little plastic stick &apos;s a high @-@ value item ,
seein &apos; as how dalton &apos;s willing to shell out all this cash
to have luana mule it out .
he tells the killer ,
she hightails it down and tries to take it ,
with dollar signs in her eyes .
or maybe she found out from dalton .
butterfly tattoo .
so our killer &apos;s name is anna novick .
according to dalton &apos;s neighbors ,
the two have been dating for about six months
and living together for the past three .
okay . what else do we know about her ?
well , for starters ,
she told her neighbors she was from seattle , washington .
but records show she &apos;s from ... someplace else .
she &apos;s from st. petersburg , russia .
she came here two years ago on a short @-@ term student visa
and liked it so much she decided to stay .
all right , so what do we got ?
we got a nerdy government contractor
with , uh , access to confidential information .
uh , we got a pretty russian girl
who is also a trained killer .
uh , i &apos;ll take a guess .
she &apos;s a ... she &apos;s a spy .
she honeypotted dalton
and talked him into stealing some files for her .
all right , i &apos;m with you on the spy part , okay ?
but there &apos;s something about this
that still doesn &apos;t make sense .
if anna talked dalton into doing this , then why ...
why isn &apos;t he giving her the file ?
why is he trying to smuggle it out ?
well , it could be that dalton went rogue
and had plans of his own .
somehow anna finds out and wants the files for herself .
i &apos;m not so sure about that .
i pulled dalton &apos;s cell phone records
and about a minute after he escaped ,
turns out he texted anna .
&quot; need help . iwilei and pacific . one hour . &quot;
when did dalton send this message ?
about 52 minutes ago .
well , if these two aren &apos;t working together ,
this boy just signed his own death warrant .
i &apos;m screwed .
what happened ?
brenner knows .
i didn &apos;t cover my tracks well enough .
take a breath .
it &apos;s okay , we &apos;ll figure it out .
can &apos;t go back to my house .
‭ no , no ! no , no !
chris dalton ! anna novick !
get out of the car and keep your hands where we can see them !
okay . just get out and play dumb .
shut up .
what language was that ? who were you talking to ?
driver !
out of the car !
hold your fire .
stay down .
danny !
get out !
move , move , move !
danny , now !
got him !
keep moving !
get your hand off that rifle !
get down !
this way ! they &apos;re over here !
what &apos;s up ?
you and your girlfriend are in a lot of trouble , chris .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
she &apos;s not your girlfriend ?
that &apos;s not what your neighbors said .
you don &apos;t understand .
i thought she was somebody else .
i don &apos;t know who this woman is .
oh , so you &apos;re telling me you , uh ,
you didn &apos;t know she was a russian spy ?
what ?
no . what ?
okay .
i think i see what &apos;s going on here .
anna &apos;s an very attractive woman .
you were taken with her , she seduced you
and convinced you to download classified information .
you &apos;re wrong , it wasn &apos;t like that .
then why don &apos;t you set me straight ?
i just wanted to make my country a better place .
by compromising its national security ?
no ! i just wanted things to be different !
how ?
no more mass surveillance .
no more spying on americans .
when i met anna , she told me that she felt the same way .
i said that i wanted to do something .
she said that if we had leverage ,
we could force change .
change .
yeah .
if we had secrets that
the government didn &apos;t want revealed , we could ...
extort them .
but instead of money , we would demand change .
she said that we would be patriots .
she saw an opening and she @-@ she exploited it .
you understand ?
she made you feel like
stealing those files was a noble act .
she probably figured she &apos;d just grab them afterwards .
that was never gonna happen ,
because i told her once we had that information ,
we had to leave the country .
but they might be onto us , so we had to be careful .
smuggle it out .
she said she &apos;d do it .
she practically begged me .
but i told her i would handle it ,
because i didn &apos;t want to put her at risk .
no , but you put tommy luana at risk .
he doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s carrying .
if he &apos;s stopped , he can plead ignorance .
he &apos;s not gonna plead anything .
okay ? tommy luana &apos;s dead .
anna killed him and two other people
to get her hands on that flash drive .
anna has the drive ?
yeah , anna has the drive .
and here &apos;s what i don &apos;t understand .
here &apos;s what i can &apos;t figure out .
anna has the drive , but she still came for you .
now why would she do that ?
why ? why , why ?
because she needs me .
how does she need you ?
i encrypted the flash drive .
i didn &apos;t even tell her i was doing it .
the key isn &apos;t written down anywhere .
it &apos;s all in my head .
i &apos;m the only one who can unlock those files .
anna probably tried to open them , and when she couldn &apos;t ,
she must have realized what i &apos;d done .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
so without you , the drive is useless .
is that right ?
and that &apos;s why she came running when i texted .
where is she right now ?
you know where she &apos;s going ?
no .
what about people she might reach out to ?
no .
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m coming up now .
the patrol car that anna took off in
was found abandoned on castle street .
uh , hpd canvassed the area ,
but nobody saw her get in .
we did id one of her associates , though .
the guy kono clipped .
his name &apos;s oleg larionov .
he &apos;s former russian fsb turned private contractor .
he &apos;s in surgery now ,
but they think he &apos;s gonna pull through .
yeah , when he gets out ,
we &apos;re gonna move him to a secure wing
and then post swat outside his door .
all right , good .
also , you got a visitor .
brenner .
commander .
sorry to barge in like this , but this couldn &apos;t wait .
oh , no problem . what &apos;s up ?
our engineers were able to identify
which files chris downloaded .
the good news is anything
that have been mentioned have been shut down .
most of the agents have been recalled .
great .
the bad news is
there are still a few deep cover operatives
who , at the moment , can &apos;t be reached .
all right . well , you &apos;ll be happy to hear
that dalton took steps to encode those files
on that drive in such a way that only he can access them .
so for now , the information is safe .
that is good to hear .
of course , no encryption is foolproof .
the people that are behind this will throw
everything they have into breaking it .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
but at least we &apos;ve bought ourselves
some time to find them .
at the very least ,
time to find those operatives
who were potentially compromised now
and pull them out of the field .
actually , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you might be able to help with that .
how so ?
your name came up in connection with one of the operatives .
the cia &apos;s been desperate trying to reach her ,
but they &apos;ve had no luck .
i think everyone &apos;s hoping
you might have a direct line .
all right , brenner .
i ... i don &apos;t know where doris is , okay ?
i &apos;m not talking about your mother , commander .
i &apos;m talking about lieutenant catherine rollins .
what ?
apparently , she &apos;s called you a few times from a sat phone .
yeah , she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s doing aid work in south asia .
according to the information that we have ,
she &apos;s involved in a clandestine operation in kiev .
ukraine ?
yes .
do you have any way of reaching her ?
my understanding is she &apos;s not scheduled
to check in with her handler until the end of the week .
of course , the fear is that by then it might be too late .
commander ?
do you have a direct line to lieutenant rollins ?
no .
no , i don &apos;t .
tell me again .
tell me again you &apos;re the only one
who knows how to unlock those files .
what ?
what what ? !
listen to me , all right ?
somebody very important to me
is at risk because what you have done .
now , tell me you &apos;re the only one who can unlock those files .
yes , yes ...
are you sure ?
are you sure ?
yes .
i encrypted the file with a 128 @-@ bit aes key ,
and i , uh , tacked on a few additional security measures .
tr @-@ trust me , it is secure .
i am the only person that , um ...
trust me , it &apos;s , uh ...
i &apos;m the per ...
what the hell &apos;s the matter with him ?
chris , hey , hey .
chris .
chris .
steve ...
danny .
steve .
danny .
oh , my ...
danny , you all right ?
what the hell happened ?
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m thinking ...
i &apos;m thinking it must have been fentanyl .
the russians used to use it .
they must have put it into aerosol form
and piped it in through the vents .
hey , take it easy , take it easy .
it &apos;s been 40 minutes .
they &apos;re long gone .
dalton might be halfway off the island now .
use your legs , use your legs .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
hey , you guys all right ?
no .
same thing happened to you ?
feel woozy .
what about the people downstairs ?
i &apos;ll check on &apos; em .
dalton &apos;s gone .
what ?
kono , pull up the palace security cameras .
what about jerry ? anybody check on jerry ?
dudes ! kono !
the craziest thing just happened to me .
yeah , we know , jer .
the same thing just happened to us .
what ?
the same thi ... we were all asleep , jerry .
