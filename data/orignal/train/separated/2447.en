I don't know what we were
or what we're supposed to be,
I've never felt more alive.
In our coven's tradition,
after their 22nd birthday,
the twins merge their strength.
The weaker one dies.
I'll find a way.
I'm not gonna let you die.
I hate you for ruining our friendship,
and I think that I deserve better than that.
I haven't been there for her.
Caroline needed me, and I ran away.
You're dying, mom.
And we're out of options.
Which is why I gave my blood to a cancer patient.
And I healed him.
I am not ready to lose you now.
I want you to live for me.
Everything's gonna be ok.
Caroline Forbes.
Colin?
What the hell did you do to me?
What?
My mom's still sleeping.
Don't wake her up.
What happened?
I don't know.
H-he was fine when we left him at Duke, remember?
He was running around and pain-free
and scarfing down all that disgusting vending machine food.
Yeah? Well, clearly, he's not fine now.
Wait. I thought you compelled him to forget everything
after you fed him your blood.
How did he find you?
I don't know.
What if this blood isn't even his?
Is there any chance that your mom signed the house over to you?
I don't know. Maybe.
She's been running around like crazy,
saying she need to get her ducks in a row or...
He's a vampire,
Which means after you fed him your blood...
He died.
Calculator. Calculator.
Where is the calculator?
Of course. Under the catatonic serial killer.
Sandwich?
I can't. I'm late for my volunteer shift at the hospital.
Ok.
Ooh. That's new.
Oh, yeah. Jo made me a new daylight ring.
You like?
Depends. Does it work?
Well, I'm here, aren't I?
Yeah, inside in the shade.
I know everyone has their doubts about Jo's magic,
but she has an entire month to get stronger
and win the merge with Kai,
so a little bit of support wouldn't kill anybody.
Speaking of killing people.
Still counting sheep
or whatever the hell you psychopaths dream of?
Look. Alaric's gone out of town
to get some mystical thingamabob
to give Jo an edge,
and your job is to baby-sit Kai,
not smother him with a pillow.
Fine.
And if he starts twitching or something,
just give him 50 milligrams of pentobarbital.
You're so cute when you're all doctorly.
You forgot this.
You're not free tonight by any chance, are you,
because I know this little Italian joint
that has eggplant so good
you actually think you're eating people.
And I happen to have a weird eggplant obsession.
Perfect.
Great!
And I'm thinking maybe after that
go to the art house theater.
They're playing some pretentious French flick.
I don't speak French, Damon.
Not to see the movie, silly,
but to hide in the back and throw popcorn at hipsters.
Wait. We've gone on this date already, haven't we?
Damon, that's cheating, ok?
You already know everything about me.
Cheating? Cheating is erasing all of our epic memories.
That's cheating.
I'm serious.
Look. If we're gonna do this,
then we can't just pick up where we left off
because I don't remember where that is.
I understand.
Where would you like to start?
At the beginning.
I'm off at 6:00. You can pick me up then.
Fine.
Fine.
Great.
Great.
Good.
Bye.
Bye.
How about Atlantis
or, like, the sea of tranquility?
On the moon?
I hear it's nice there.
It's--it's very tranquil.
I'm serious.
Pick a real place.
Why are we talking about spending spring break
anywhere other than this tiny bed,
which we should probably leave at some point today.
Ignore that.
Olivia, you home?
Olivia?
Oh, my God. He's early.
Who's early?
Sweetheart, it's your old man.
Here. Put this on.
Your dad? What's he doing here?
He wants to take Luke and me out to dinner.
Hide!
Dad, hi! I-I thought we were meeting later.
Well, we were, but I wanted a couple of extra minutes with my girl.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
I adjusted Mrs. Murphy's dose of fentanyl.
Keep an eye on her. Thanks.
Phesmatos tribum, plantus vivifae,
Plantus...hederus.
Should I call it?
Time of death-- anybody's guess.
Well, in the magical win column,
I just walked across campus without bursting into flame,
so there's that.
I need help.
I had Duke send over Colin's medical records.
This head scan is from earlier this week.
This one...
was taken right here 10 minutes ago.
See all that red?
Well, I'm no doctor, but that guy is screwed.
So the blood didn't heal him.
It sped up his cancer and killed him.
So now I have a stage 10 cancer patient,
which by the way doesn't exist,
who is beyond terminally ill and a vampire,
meaning all of his emotions are heightened,
and he can't die.
Hey. No offense, but can someone tell me
why I was called down here to listen
to the story of Colin the cancer vamp--
Because Caroline fed me her blood last night,
so the same thing is gonna happen to me.
Any news?
No, not yet. It's a little outside of Jo's expertise.
Did you know
that Caroline was gonna give her mom vampire blood?
Yeah. I was there when it healed Colin.
And then you left, and then he died,
so it didn't actually heal him.
It did the opposite.
Caroline had every reason to think it would work.
Yeah, but you didn't, Stefan.
You're, like, 165 years old.
You've worked as a paramedic at hospitals.
So that makes me an expert in supernatural cancer treatment.
I just wish that you'd done a little bit more research
or waited, uh, like a day.
Because you were thinking so rationally when Damon died, right?
Her mother is terminal.
You didn't see the hope in her eyes
when she thought that maybe her mother didn't have to die,
and I didn't want to be the one to take that away from her.
Jo has an idea.
Medically speaking, this is our best option.
If vampire blood is the issue,
then a full transfusion of human blood
might stabilize her condition.
Please sound less confident, doc.
Look. We are in uncharted territory here,
but this isn't just a medical problem, Damon.
It's a magical one.
Well, then you're uniquely qualified--
witch doctor and all.
Now you believe in my magic. Gee, thanks.
Unfortunately, this goes beyond any witch ability I've ever heard of,
but please if you have a better plan,
I'm all ears.
Why did you tell me your birthday was in two weeks?
To avoid this exact conversation.
Am I wearing too much eyeliner?
If you and Luke are 22,
that means you're old enough to merge.
That's why Luke and I are gonna bust out
our wonder twin powers of persuasion,
make dad think that Jo's powerful to overpower Kai,
and Luke and I won't have to do the merge.
You're wearing way too much makeup,
and he shouldn't be here.
He's not staying,
and why are you wearing a tie?
I'm about to ask the leader of the Gemini coven
to let us out of a centuries-old tradition.
I kind of need him to take me seriously.
You should let me talk to him.
Really bad idea.
Promise me that you'll stay out of it.
What happens if you don't convince him?
We will.
You die.
You and Luke merge, Luke wins, you die.
Do you trust me?
Do I have a choice?
Then don't worry.
You're not gonna lose me.
"Hey, the blood transfusions
are stopping the cancer from eating her alive,"
or "Hey, is there a sheriff-sized space
available in the family crypt"?
I don't know. Jo's still running some tests to find that out.
She should be out in a minute.
I don't know if you remember this,
but Liz and I are pretty close.
Yeah.
I mean, as far as humans go, she's...
tolerable.
I can see how much you care about her,
but we all do, so if there's anything we can do to fix this,
trust me, we will.
Yeah.
The coffee machine's broken.
Seriously, what kind of hospital is this?
If you can't fix a coffee machine,
then how are you supposed to be able to fix people?
Sure you don't need some real food?
There's probably a machine around here that vends O positive.
We screwed up big time.
Why did I feed her that blood?
You were trying to help.
No. I was trying to fix something
that I had no business trying to fix.
It's like textbook definition of control freak from hell.
Listen. You are an optimist.
You want to believe that anything is possible,
and that is exactly what your mom needs to hear right now.
Ok?
That's Colin's room.
I can't die.
Why can't I die?
Calm down, calm down.
It's ok, it's ok.
It's not ok!
I'm agony. I can hear my tumors growing.
Ok. We'll try to help, but just please stop hurting yourself.
You want to help me?
Help me die.
Why the hell did you do that?
He made a wish.
I granted it.
The blood transfusion didn't work,
so you didn't just kill him, blondie.
That's enough, Damon.
No. It's fine.
He's just saying what everyone else is thinking.
I killed my mom.
It's Caroline.
Leave a message.
Caroline, where are you?
Call me, or better idea,
just...just come back.
How are you feeling?
Like a human pin cushion.
So...what's the verdict?
Did the blood swap work?
We're not sure yet.
I mean, Jo's still doing some tests.
You shouldn't lie to sick people, Elena.
It's bad kama.
They thought it would slow down the cancer cells from replicating,
but it didn't work.
I'm sorry.
How's Caroline?
She's good. She just ran out to get some food.
Elena.
She just took off,
and now I can't find her,
I can't get ahold of her.
She's not gonna forgive herself for this, is she?
I'll make sure that we find her.
I promise.
Thank you.
Good! You're here.
I actually need a second opinion.
I kind of like this because sunflowers are her favorite flower,
but at the same time, I was also thinking
maybe they're a little too over-the-top cheerful
for a memorial service,
so this was the second option,
um, because roses are classic, right?
I mean, especially in this shade of pink.
Obviously, I would change out the vase, but...ahem.
If you're thinking of saying something to make me feel better, don't.
I don't deserve to feel better.
I wasn't.
Good.
I was actually thinking that you have far more important things to do
than plan a memorial service for your mother,
who's still a live, by the way.
Yeah, but all of this still needs to be done, right?
She's not gonna want to live out the rest of her life
as a vampire in excruciating pain,
so I should do something that I'm good at
instead of making everything worse.
Which arrangement?
Caroline, you took a risk.
It didn't pay off, but you did it out of love.
You made your mother sicker, ok,
but what are you gonna do now?
are you just gonna bury your head in the sand?
I don't...
I don't know what to say to her.
You don't have to say anything to her.
Just sit with her.
I can't. I can't even fff--
Face her.
Look. When I was young,
my mom, she got really sick,
and instead of spending time with her,
I did everything I could to avoid her,
like picking out her favorite flowers
or walking into town to get the tea that she liked,
and I pretended like I was doing it for her,
but I wasn't.
I was just afraid to see her like that,
And then my dad, he, uh...
he sent her away, and she died.
I would give anything to have one more day with her.
What if she can't forgive me?
She doesn't think there's anything to forgive.
She just wants you to be with her.
You're refusing to merge?
We want to consider other options.
There are no other options.
If a set of twins doesn't merge,
then the Gemini bloodline will cease to exist upon my death.
That means the entire coven will die.
Is that what you want?
No, of course not, but you are in perfect health,
Kai is on ice.
That means we have time to figure this out.
There's nothing to figure out.
This is what you were born to do.
No, dad. This is why Kai and Jo were born.
We were just the backup plan you bred
because you thought that your first batch had a design flaw.
Kai is a psychopath,
an extremely dangerous one.
Dad, Jo can do this.
She can win.
All we're asking is that you give her a chance.
I'm not asking you to do anything I haven't done myself.
That's easy for you to say?
You merged with your twin brother, and you won.
You didn't drop dead.
It doesn't work like that, and you know it.
One will absorb traits from the other.
Both of your souls will unite into a new being.
Who looks exactly like me.
Yeah, I know I'm stronger than Liv,
so that means I will win if we merge,
so you can put whatever poetic spin you want on it,
but I will be killing my own sister.
I can't do that to her.
Bad timing, Lockwood. I'm in a mood.
What the hell are you doing?
I'll make it easier on you.
I'll give you multiple choice.
A--"I'm being an idiot."
B--"I have anger issues, and I'm a puny human now,
and I have to pick on people while they sleep."
C--"A and b are both correct."
Liv's dad is in town.
Really.
She's trying to convince him to let Jo and Kai do the merge.
Oh, so you just thought you'd come and grab Kai as a failsafe.
In case papa Parker says no to Liv and Luke,
you just turn him loose, and he merges with Jo anyway, huh?
While I appreciate your efforts,
he's a psycho freak magic siphon.
I'm not gonna just let you walk out wit him.
I could kiss you right now,
You beautiful moron.
What are you talking about?
Yep. That stuff works really well.
Nighty night.
That should keep you down for an hour.
Not a good time.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, twinderella.
Big pitch going south, is it?
Where's Tyler?
Well, the good news is your boyfriend and I,
I think, have come up with a solution.
Now it's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but I think everybody gets what they need.
I just have to ask papa Parker one question,
so do you mind putting him on?
I want to talk to Tyler.
He's, uh, out at the moment.
Yes?
Hello, sir. Damon Salvatore here.
We had Thanksgiving together.
Anyway, I've been sitting here Googling
celestial events happening today,
and I was just curious.
Would a mercury-venus conjunction give you
enough juice to do a little gemini merge party?
Why?
I'm gonna take that evasive answer as a yes.
So here's the situation.
I'm gonna need you to use that planet party
to merge your set of blond twins asap
because, well, unfortunately your formerly comatose son
is gonna be on the loose and hell-bent on beating you to the punch.
Rise and shine, you little weasel.
Ooh! Trying to pop a blood vessel in my brain?
Sorry. Not gonna work.
Looks like all that magic you sucked up
drained away while you were asleep,
which is good for me.
Don't worry. I know where you can get more.
You really think I'm gonna trust you?
No, and I'm not gonna trust you.
I just happen to need a magic siphon,
and you're the only game in town.
Let's discuss my fee.
All right. I need a 12-gauge needle stat.
Don't know what I'm gonna do with it,
but I need it.
You're not a doctor, so stop playing games,
but I am a vampire,
and I will rip your head off
if you screw this up.
What she said,
so do your stupid little magic suction trick
and suck the magic out of her right now.
I get what you two see in each other.
It's very dys-fun-ctional.
Ha! You see what I did, stressing the "fun" in dysfunctional?
Just get on with it, Kai.
Listening to you talk makes me want to die.
That's good.
Is it working?
I have no idea.
What the hell is going on?
What is he doing here?
Hey, sis. Little busy.
Be with you in a jiffy.
Elena?
I'm gonna let Damon explain it.
I'm staying with you.
Have you actually lost your mind?
Hey. Shh. Listen. You told me Liz was gonna die
in 8 hours if the magic kept doing its thing.
He steals magic. You made it through med school.
I figured you'd know where I was going with this.
If you think Kai is doing this out of the goodness of his heart,
I can assure you he doesn't have one.
What's the price?
He wants to merge
tonight.
There. All done.
Sheriff, hey. How are you feeling?
You ok?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Oh, my god. No, no, no.
I think she's having a heart attack.
That is so tragic,
you know, because you guys jumped through hoops
to get the magic out of her system,
but then her ticker's just
not strong enough to take a little siphon.
Kai, you have to fix this!
I can't merge tonight.
I am not ready.
You almost burned my house down.
Don't you think I know that?
Luckily for you, it's all been taken care of.
Damon, what the hell did you do?
Look. I--
Magical neck snap.
Never gets old.
Isn't this the part where you start running?
I've spent my entire life running from you.
I'm not running anymore.
What are you doing out here?
Just thinking about how proud I am of you and your brother.
Built a good life for yourselves here.
Does that mean you'll think about what we asked?
Of course.
We share a history,
a bloodline.
We're in this together.
We're family.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
You're merging us?
Kai has been released.
He's going after Jo.
I can't let him get to her!
Dad, stop!
I'm gonna kill her.
She's not strong enough, dad!
I'm sorry.
She's not strong enough, dad!
There's no other option.
Sanguinem desimilus,
Sanguinem generis finatus.
She said no!
Tyler!
Tyler, stop!
He was going to kill you.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Luke, where are you going?
You trust me?
Where are you going?
I'll be back soon.
Promise.
Look at those pretty planets,
all twinkly and bright.
Oh, Josette, you would not believe how sick I am of eclipses.
Let's just get this over with.
You know, if you think I didn't spend
the last 18 years in solitary thinking
about how you screwed me over last time,
you're wrong.
So if this just another setup,
I'll rip something out more important than a spleen
like a tongue
or a heart.
So any closing remarks?
You're a parasite.
You killed the people I loved,
you shoved a hunting knife in my gut,
you destroyed my life.
Now I'm gonna destroy yours.
I guess we'll see...
Won't we?
Sanguinem desimilus.
Sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus.
Sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus.
Sanguinem generis finatus.
What the hell did you just do?
Oh, I just gave my big sister a little magic knock on the head,
but don't worry.
She'll be fine.
Because you're gonna merge with me.
You want to merge with me.
I hate to break it to you, little brother,
but we're not twins, all right?
That's not how this is supposed to work.
Well, that's true,
but we share the same parents,
the same bloodline,
and thanks to your timeout in the magic penalty box.
We're the same age.
So it's definitely a hail mary,
and--and maybe it won't work.
But I'd do anything to save my sister's life.
So...
We're gonna give it the old college try.
Thanks, but I'm gonna pass.
Phasmatos motus arrovox.
What's wrong?
Are you afraid to play chicken with someone
who might actually beat you?
Fine. It's your funeral.
Stay with me, sheriff.
Breathe!
Elena, hey.
What happened?
It's her heart. I'm losing her, Damon.
Ok. No offense, Elena,
but I think we need to get a real doctor.
So find one now!
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Luke, no!
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus...
Luke, no!
Sanguinem generis finatus.
Sanguinem desimilus,
sanguinem generis finatus.
No!
Luke.
Come on. Luke, Luke, wake up.
How long has she been down?
What does that mean? Dead?
I-I don't know. Maybe I think it was a minute.
It feels like an hour.
Clear!
Caroline?
Honey, I'm leaving.
Do you want to say good-bye?
I compelled you to save her.
Unless you want me to gouge your eyes out,
I suggest you keep working. Here.
I've done all that I can do.
She's gone. I'm sorry.
Get out of here. Forget you're a total failure.
No. No. No. I will not let this happen.
Wake up!
She's gone.
Come on.
No. No, no, no!
Mom, mom, mom!
Mommy! No, mom!
No.
Don't leave me, please.
Please don't.
Please don't leave me, mom.
Caroline?
Didn't you hear me, sweetheart?
It's time for me to go.
You don't want to say good-bye to your mom?
Mom?
It's ok, baby. I'm right here.
Mom.
It's ok. I'm right here.
It's ok.
I'm right here.
It's ok, it's ok.
Where are you going?
I-I need some air
or some water or something
because...
She almost died in my arms, Damon.
Caroline's mom almost died in my arms.
I thought you wanted to start over
because, FYI, this is exactly where we left off.
I don't care.
Life's too short.
Immortal or not, I don't want to waste another minute.
Hello, stranger.
Are you ok?
I've just been sitting here trying to figure out what to say.
I guess I should lead with I'm sorry for almost killing you.
Oh, sweetheart, please.
You know me.
I'm the world's unluckiest gambler.
I'm just sorry that I wasn't here.
I couldn't, and--
No, no, no, no.
This wasn't your fault.
I need you to stop beating yourself up.
Can you do that for me?
Ok.
Can you say it like you mean it?
I will.
Mom, you put the house in my name.
Couple weeks ago.
Just in case anything--
Yeah. Well, I don't--
I'm not ready for that yet.
I'm sorry,
and I promise you I will stick around as long as I can,
ok?
Ok.
Come here.
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I guess someone fixed the coffee machine.
That smells amazing.
I would give you a million dollars for a decaf latte.
What do you say?
Would you mind getting one for your poor, sick mom?
I can do that.
Ok.
I'll be right back.
So looks like we can cross miracle cure off the list.
Must be some other option.
I need you to promise me something.
Ok.
When I'm gone, Caroline is gonna need you,
even if she doesn't know it.
She's gonna need someone to help her move on with her life,
someone to just make her smile.
Promise me that you will do that, Stefan.
I promise.
Luke.
Luke, wake up.
Luke.
Good. You're still alive.
That's gonna save me a huge blowout with Ric when he gets back,
but I'm definitely coming into something late.
Luke showed up, and he merged with Kai.
So I guess adding the words "Twin merge"
to my vocabulary was pointless
because they ain't twins.
He's not supposed to be here.
The only reason he's here is because you let Kai out!
Luke, Luke, wake up. Wake up, Luke.
Well, uh, let me give him some of my blood.
It wouldn't help.
It's up to them now.
Whoever wakes up is the winner,
and whoever doesn't...
Can you hear me?
Can--can you hear me?
Why the hell won't Luke call me back?
Do you want me to go look for him?
Yes. No! I don't know.
Dad.
What has your brother done?
Luke?
W-w-wake up, Luke.
Come on.
Oh, my god.
We have to leave now.
She's not going anywhere with you.
Luke is gone.
What?
I feel it.
He merged with Kai. Kai won.
Luke is gone.
I don't believe you.
We have to run, Olivia.
I'm not going anywhere with you!
You think he's gonna keep you safe?
She's staying with me!
You change your mind,
you know where to find us.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Oh my God.
Luke.
He's gone.
He saved me, and he's gone.
You win some, you lose some.
Except for me.
I always win.
