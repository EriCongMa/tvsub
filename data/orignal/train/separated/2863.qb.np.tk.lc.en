i was not flirting .
and on your anniversary . for shame !
what &apos;s going on ?
he was hitting on the hot delivery girl .

it doesn &apos;t mean anything . just like it doesn &apos;t mean anything with you .
there &apos;s a difference . you &apos;re a lot hotter than i am .
true story .
this actually bothers you ?
yes , and i think it &apos;d bother a lot of people .
when you and ross dated ...
... did it bother you when he flirted with other women ?
no , it bothered me when he slept with other women .
and thank you for that .
i never had to worry.he was never good at the flirting thing .
what ?
what are you talking about ? it worked with you .
no , you &apos;re right .
we met , you flirted and then bam ! nine years later , you had me .
all right .
you know what i &apos;ll do ? i &apos;ll order another pizza.and when caitlin gets here
... i will show you how well i flirt .
