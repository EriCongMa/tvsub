so your first sexual experience was with a woman ?
i was 15 . it was my best friend , ruth .
and we got drunk on that hard cider .
and then suddenly , we were making out .
tell it again .
seriously .
can that woman talk about anything else but sex ?
yeah , sure . earlier she was talking about geography .
she was listing the countries she &apos;s done it in .
i think we all learned something .
hey , you guys ! look what i found !
that &apos;s my mom &apos;s writing . look .
&quot; me and frank and phoebe , graduation , 1965 . &quot;
do you know what that means ?
that you &apos;re actually 50 ?
that &apos;s not &quot; me &quot; phoebe . that &apos;s her pal , phoebe .
according to her yearbook , they were bff .
best friends forever .
that &apos;s great !
i know ! she probably has all kinds of stories about my parents .
she might know where my dad is .
i looked her up . she lives by the beach .
maybe this weekend we can go there .
shoot , i can &apos;t go . i have to work .
that &apos;s too bad .
big fat bummer .
so tomorrow we &apos;ll drive out to montauk .
hey , bonnie had sex there !
the one at the beach
joey will be right down.he &apos;s looking for his mask .
a swim mask ?
no , his gorilla mask .
he wears it in the ocean to scare off the fish .
would you look at them ?
i &apos;m never gonna find a boyfriend again .
i &apos;m gonna die an old maid .
you &apos;re not gonna die an old maid .
maybe an old spinster cook .
thanks .
besides , worse comes to worse ...
... i &apos;ll be your boyfriend .
yeah , right .
why is that so funny ?
you made a joke , right ?
so i laughed .
a little too hard .
am i not boyfriend material ?
you &apos;re chandler .
you know . chandler !
okay , so we &apos;ve established my name , and hit me .
but say we weren &apos;t friends . say it &apos;s a blind date .
i show up at your door and i &apos;m , like , &quot; hey , nice to meet you . &quot;
i &apos;d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice .
oh , good . you bought food .
no , just my luggage .
i am having the best karma this week .
i find this woman who knew my parents ...
... and then my client gives me his beach house .
what about that bike messenger you hit ?
oh , i wasn &apos;t talking about his karma .
hey , check out the hat !
wait a minute , i know that hat .
i was taken aboard that hat .
they did experiments on me .
i can &apos;t have children !
seriously , where did you get the hat ?
ross gave it to me .
i think she looks good .
did he buy it for you ...
... or win it for you ?
excuse me , my fashion @-@ impaired friends ...
... i &apos;m here to tell you hats are back .
and this time , they &apos;ve ganged up and formed one giant super @-@ hat .
go , go , go !
now everybody wants to be under the hat !
what &apos;s with all this sand ?
bob said there might be flood damage .
either that or he has a really big cat .
you know what this reminds me of ?
why couldn &apos;t l be your boyfriend ?
are you still on that ?
would you let it go already ?
thank you , joey .
but you &apos;d go out with me , right ?
no. lt &apos;s the same as with chandler.we &apos;re friends .
let &apos;s say that we were the last two guys on the planet ...
... and you had a gun to your head.which one would you pick ?
which one of you has the gun to my head ?
it &apos;s kind of an unusual house .
it has three beautiful bedrooms and no baths .
but , you know , the ocean is right there .
iknock , knock , knock .
hang on . come in , come in .
think about it and call me back .

... but i found this picture .
isn &apos;t this what he would look like now ?
totally familiar .
why would she lie to you ?
we &apos;re having dinner tomorrow . maybe she &apos;ll tell me then .
maybe she just wanted to give him time ...

joey and chandler sure are funny .
i brought back half the beach in my hair .
it was easier when i shaved my head .

oh , stop . go on .
now go shave that head .
all right .
l know l &apos;ve asked you this before .
a hundred times before !
how am l not right for you ?
l don &apos;t know .
l like guys like richard .
or pete , before he went insane .
l don &apos;t know.just somebody more mature .
so l &apos;m not mature enough for you ?
monica needs somebody more mature .
what &apos;s the matter ?
she canceled . my namesake canceled on me .
she claims she had to go out of town . she &apos;s avoiding me .
she doesn &apos;t want to tell me where my father is . she knows !
pheebs , that sucks .
well , don &apos;t &quot; pheebs , that sucks &quot; me yet .
where are you going ?
she &apos;s out of town .
something in her house will tell me where he is .
some people call that &quot; breaking and entering . &quot;
well , are any of those people here ?
look , i &apos;ll do something nice , okay ?
i &apos;ll fill her ice trays . good ?
hey , everybody !
look what you did !
you wanna touch it ?
no , but it &apos;s great .
come on , touch it .
you can feel all the bones in your skull .
i was having a little chat with bonnie , and guess what ?
she brought up who was behind the head @-@ shaving idea .
and now , who was it ? oh , that &apos;s right . it was you !
that was her idea .
i just gave her a nudge .
she said you gave her the razor .
so anyone up for a midnight dip ?
no , i &apos;m good .
no , thanks .
okay , i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
okay , have fun .
come on , see ? she doesn &apos;t look that bad .
you can see the moonlight bouncing off her head !
what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know .
you balded my girlfriend !
all right .
do you think it &apos;s easy for me to see you with somebody else ?
you &apos;re the one who ended it !
because i was mad at you ! not because i stopped loving you !
you still love me ?
you still love me .
yeah , so ?
you love me .
what does this mean ?
i mean , do you want to get back together ?
no ! maybe !
i don &apos;t know .
i still can &apos;t forgive you for what you did .
but sometimes when i &apos;m with you , i just feel so ....

okay , look .
i took this picture from your fridge . i know that this is my father .
this is frank buffay , and you were standing next to him !
i deserve to know where i came from .
so if you can help me find my father , then you should .
otherwise , you &apos;re just mean .
so just tell me the truth .
all right .
the man in that picture is chuck mangione .
my father is chuck mangione ?
that &apos;s just chuck mangione .
i sold him a house last year .
and i &apos;m very sorry , but i really don &apos;t know where your father is .
and that &apos;s the truth .
but you &apos;re right .
i think a person should know where they come from .
which is why l ....
i &apos;m your mother .
i wanted to tell you yesterday , but i just ...
... felt all floopy , and ....
you guys are getting back together .
she doesn &apos;t even know what she wants .
rachel &apos;s still mad at me .
then you gotta back away . you don &apos;t need that kind of hurt .
take it from a guy who &apos;s ...
... never had a long @-@ term relationship .
i know , but i really want to go up there and finish that kiss .
the water is great . you should go in .
no , thanks . i just had an m &amp; m.
well , good night .
good night .
don &apos;t be too long .
okey @-@ dokey .
there is not one hair on that head .
it &apos;ll grow back , right ? and she &apos;s really fun , and she &apos;s cool .
and i &apos;m finally moving on .
getting over rachel was so
i &apos;m finally feeling sane . and if i go up there ...
... and i kiss her ....
god , i want to kiss her !
and it doesn &apos;t work out . do i wanna put myself through that again ?
let me get this straight .
if you go with bonnie , you do the smart , healthy thing and move on .
right ? and if you go with rachel , bonnie &apos;s free tonight ?
hi there .
that &apos;s that weird voice again .
let me try it again .
you &apos;ll wanna date this next guy , i swear !
l can only do it with the voice now .
okay , okay.close the door !
hi , i &apos;m dorf !
your date for the evening .
