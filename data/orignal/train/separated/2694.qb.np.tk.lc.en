how are you feeling , from your accident ?
fine , thank you .
honestly , if you &apos;d told me five years ago i &apos;d be sitting here today ...
anthony &apos;s attacks , how do they make you feel ?
well , concerned , of course .
helpless .
frustrated , maybe .
with your inability to help him ?
i was referring to your inability to help him .
she has helped me . what are you saying ?
i understand your frustration .
did he share our insights about his last panic attack ?
i told you , remember ? the capocollo , and my mother when i was a kid .
right , yes .
is there anything in the family dynamic that could serve as a trigger ?
something in your dialoguing ?
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t know you that well . we &apos;re trying to get to root causes .
maybe you do things that affect me .
oh , really ?
what ? people affect each other in life .
oh , is this how it works ?
you &apos;re looking for someone to point the finger at ?
she didn &apos;t say anything . don &apos;t get defensive !
you know what ? maybe you should explore your own behavior .
maybe you pass out because you &apos;re guilty .
you stick your dick in anything , maybe that &apos;s a root cause .
very nice . that &apos;s very nice .
i told you months ago i broke it off with that russian person . right ?
it &apos;s like smoking your whole life and then suing cigarette companies .
you agreed to come here .
forget it , this is fucking ridiculous .
right , just sit there .
silence , anger , then you pass out and you blame the rest of the world .
yeah , i love you too .
you &apos;re both very angry .
must &apos;ve been top of your class .
jesus christ !
what ?
great . and i &apos;m the one that doesn &apos;t fucking communicate ?
want to know what &apos;s wrong ?
after 19 years , we have to pay someone to teach us how to interact .
you were all in favor .
slow down . stop driving like a maniac !
maybe we &apos;ll die .
think it &apos;s easy ? i &apos;m the new kid at school .
i can &apos;t even open my mouth .

there are many rooms in my father &apos;s house .
most certainly one for febby .
febby lived a full life , a life of service to others .
his 78 years saw him serve his family as a devoted father
his country as a supply sergeant in the pacific
and most importantly , our lord as a devout catholic .
when i last visited febby in the hospital ...
he &apos;d finished his chemotherapy .
though frail and extremely thin , his fighting spirit was still intact .
his body was wracked with pain .

newark gives tax breaks for reopening old factories .
i &apos;m trying to work .

yeah , but it &apos;s kind of harsh , no ?
i spoke to his unit commander .
nobody likes him . he &apos;s a rabble @-@ rouser .
yeah , maybe . but i don &apos;t know , it ...
it goes beyond you . the guy &apos;s depressed or something .

cocksuckers didn &apos;t even clean him up .
he still had bits of glass in his hair from the windshield .
what was he , 71 ?
i don &apos;t know , 68 .
what did they say ? what was the cause of death ?
who ? what do you mean ?
was it the cancer or the accident ? how advanced was the metastasis ?
all due respect , junior , what do you care about the details ?
all this technical shit ?
you &apos;re right .
the man &apos;s passed on . we should let him rest in peace .
he was a good man , your father .
a good friend .

customer says good night , you barely look up ?

is that what you want ?
what &apos;d i say ?
this marriage is over , arthur .
i &apos;m serious .
it &apos;s about fucking time .
and you &apos;re not getting the kids , either !
son of a bitch .
hey . look who &apos;s here .
he volunteered to mow your lawn .
i did not .
hi , anthony .
it &apos;s that time of year . brought the last of my sweet corn .
what &apos;s the matter ? you all right ?
anthony , be a good boy . wait outside . i need to talk to your father .
if this is about old man bacala , i don &apos;t wanna fucking hear it .
i have cancer .
you have what ?
cancer . the big casino .
jesus christ , when did you find out ?
blood in my stool .
had a test before your mother &apos;s funeral .
that &apos;s why you been acting so fucking weird ?
i mean , where is it ? is it in your colon , or ... ?
my stomach .
jesus christ , uncle jun.
did they say how bad ?
won &apos;t know until they open me up .
i go in in two weeks .
this has to stay between us , anthony .
yeah , of course .
look , we &apos;ll get you help . we &apos;ll get you the best there is .
first jackie with cancer , then febby .
old man bacala had it , but now you &apos;ll get me help ?
these things come in threes .
is that why you didn &apos;t want the old man to make the hit ?
what , if he died of cancer , he &apos;d take your place ?
i asked you not to make him do it .
jesus christ ! un @-@ fucking @-@ believable .
i &apos;m serious , anthony .
promise me that you &apos;ll dummy up about this .
yeah , all right .
you &apos;re sick , people treat you like a nonentity . i &apos;m serious .
you can &apos;t talk about this with anybody .
yeah . yeah , of course .
of course .

a lot of death .
ma .
pop and the emphysema .
uncle jun. another toothpick .
hey , jan , come on . a little respect , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just what ma used to say .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
she said that about her own brother .
another toothpick .
jesus .
what was he , 36 years old , uncle mickey ?
liver cancer .
jesus . these old @-@ timers .
the more hard @-@ ass their attitude , the more they suppress their feelings .
i think it &apos;s the illusion of control .
control ?
you say the most horrible shit you can think of in the face of tragedy .
it &apos;s like saying to god :
&quot; see ? you don &apos;t fool me , asshole . i know what you &apos;re planning . &quot;
yeah , like they &apos;re trying to ward off evil , or some shit .
remember how ma , she hated compliments ?
giving or taking them ?
because then maybe , at any minute , boom !
i really been coming to know christ .
ma , febby , uncle jun ?
always comes in threes .
and then there &apos;s the holy trinity .
you think that &apos;s a coincidence ?
what happened to sal bonpensiero ?
witness protection .
would you like to pray with me ?
why didn &apos; t you say anything ? did you report it ?
campus security &apos;s a joke .
don &apos;t you think they should know there &apos;s a thief ?
who ? what are you talking about ?
nothing .
her bike was stolen two weeks ago .
didn &apos;t you lock it up ?
they used bolt cutters .
a black guy from the neighborhood . one of the kids saw him .
what ?
did i say anything ?
a black guy ? lmagine that .
tony ...
it &apos;s just , i can &apos;t believe it .
i am not listening .
you &apos;re thinking the same thing .
what did i say ?
you &apos;re twice as likely to be robbed by a black .
that is so racist !
it &apos;s a fact .
from who , david duke ?
why are they in the basement ?
try the fbi . i saw it on tv .
you &apos;re quoting the fbi ?
they aren &apos;t .
but the lamp ?
on battery backup .
why ?
crime is economic , not racial .
you &apos;re more likely to steal if you &apos;re poor ...
... which most black people are .
wait till one takes your stereo .
you &apos;re a hypocrite !
this is what i &apos;ve been saying ! stay with your own !
where are you taking that lamp ?
mine gives me a headache .
don &apos; t change the subject !
i &apos;m out of here !
be sure to call when you need some money !
now you got something you can rat me out about in therapy !
madonna , this place !
you only retire once .
is that an earring ?
your ear , i never noticed before .
this ?
had it for years . i don &apos;t wear it all the time .
did chris tell you we had a little run @-@ in ?
he &apos;s just jealous .
of what ? we &apos;re friends .

he thinks i &apos;m with cindy .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , ade .
i &apos;m gonna miss you too , artie . charmaine , the busboys .
charmaine ...

charmaine and me , we &apos;re gonna try it apart for a little while .
oh , my god , are you okay ? the kids ?
it &apos;s for the best .
did i tell you i &apos;m gonna go into business with tony ?
what , like a restaurant ?
satriale foods .
we &apos;ll probably change the name to vesuvio .
sauce , taralli , ravioli .
that &apos;s great . congratulations !
you change your mind , there &apos;s room on my staff
for a bright , sexy vice president .
it &apos;s a big step . marriage .
