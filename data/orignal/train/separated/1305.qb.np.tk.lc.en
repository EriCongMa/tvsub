no ! no !
no ! ! no !
no ! please , no !
hey ! what the hell are you doing ? !
help !
can &apos;t believe i let you talk me into this .
it &apos;s good for you .
taking a dirt bath seems sort of ,
i don &apos;t know , unhealthy .
it &apos;s clay , not dirt .
75 % american colloid hpm @-@ 20
and 25 % western bentonite from utah .
oh , it &apos;s from utah .
well , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
spending 80 bucks to be submerged in utah dirt
is still a waste of money .
clay .
the first recorded use of a medicinal clay bath
was in mesopotamia .
it &apos;s my gift to you .
next time , just give me the cash .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to -
to eliminate toxic substances .
how ? i &apos;m up to my neck in toxic substances .
well , hydrate with the lemon water .
it &apos;s very important .
i &apos;m hungry .
mnh @-@ mnh . no , no .
heavy burden on the metabolism .
gee , i &apos;m having so much fun .
i can &apos;t remember the last time i had so much fun
marinating in mud .
shh .
you did not just shush me .
an inability to relax
could result in a dangerous buildup of cortisol .
i want you to understand something .
i don &apos;t like being shushed . my mother shushes .
okay , can you please stop talking ?
same as shushing .
okay , that &apos;s good . let &apos;s go do something else .
come on . how do i get out ?
jane .
maura .
help ! ! somebody help me !
she needs a doctor !
oh . oh @-@ oh . oh . somebody stabbed her .
call 911 .
okay .
did you get a look at the person who stabbed her ?
no , he was too far away .
she &apos;s not breathing . no pulse .
was she conscious when you found her ?
she was moaning , yeah .
when did she stop making sounds ?
a few minutes ago .
my god , she &apos;s gone . she bled out .
she &apos;s pregnant .
start cpr .
on her ? she &apos;s dead ,
maura . what about the baby ?
just do it . it &apos;s the only way to keep the baby alive .
i need a knife .
yeah , yeah , i got it .
i got a swiss army knife here .
keep doing that .
is this helping ?
you &apos;re pumping what &apos;s left of her oxygenated blood to the baby .
where &apos;s boston e.m.s. ?
they said three minutes .
how much time do we have ?
baby &apos;s stopped moving . seconds .
i need your hands . take over cpr .
what ?
do it . right here , right here .
okay , tell me what to do .
once i fully incise the abdomen ,
i need you to hold it open so i can get to the uterus .
okay .
ugh . keep going .
i need towels -- warm towels !
wide as you can .
i &apos;ve only done one c @-@ section .
that &apos;s one more than me .
okay , once i cut the fundus ,
there &apos;s gonna be a gush of amniotic fluid .
just keep the abdomen retracted .
okay .
put them right there .
okay .
i &apos;ve got its head . be ready .
come on , baby . come on .
get them in here . go on !
okay .
it &apos;s a boy . he &apos;s approximately 34 weeks .
why isn &apos;t he crying ? why are his lips so blue ?
he &apos;s cyanotic .
pull off your headband ,
use it to tie off the umbilical cord .
okay .
tighter .
good . we &apos;ve got to stop the blood loss .
in here !
what do we got ?
premature infant , approximately 34 weeks .
apgar was a 4 at birth , 6 now .
i started infant cpr and got him breathing .
okay , we &apos;ll take it from here , doc .
he &apos;s tiny . let &apos;s get him out of here .
think he &apos;s gonna make it ?
she had decent blood serum .
that will help .
oh , what a tragedy .
a motel card key .
why was she in her pajamas ?
maybe she had a craving .
oh , yeah , she &apos;s out trolling for pickles .
40 % of pregnant women crave something sweet , actually .
poor baby . his mother &apos;s dead .
yeah , but he has a life , okay ?
and we &apos;re gonna find him a family .
all right ?
search the attack site was a bust ,
heavy layer of brush and dry ground
didn &apos;t leave us any chance of finding footprints .
what about missing persons ? any luck on the card key ?
demagnetized . i &apos;m on with their corporate office .
no missing persons match our jane doe &apos;s description .
we got fingerprints off it .
they &apos;ve just turned up nothing .
they &apos;re trying to tell us which of their locations issued it .
i thought you were at the , uh , arboretum , at that spa place .
how was it ?
it wasn &apos;t very relaxing . what are you doing here ?
uh , just passing through .
you &apos;re passing through b.r.i.c ?
what &apos;s with the signals , fellas ?
what signals ?
you &apos;re both terrible liars . have you talked to ma ?
she driving you crazy , too ?
oh , yeah , i got one just like it .
that &apos;s so nice .
she keeps coming over -- my place is so clean ,
she &apos;s scrubbing the grout with a toothbrush .
you should cut your mother some slack .
she &apos;s going through a divorce .
hey , why don &apos;t you stay out of it , dad ?
i &apos;m not old enough to be your dad .
are you gonna eat that ?
it &apos;s bologna on white .
cut @-@ up carrots and celery for your arteries .
i want the chips .
hey , did we get photographs out to the area hospitals and ob / gyns ?
yeah . went out to social services , too .
if she was at a motel ,
she could &apos;ve been homeless .
oh , we got to find that baby &apos;s family .
jane ? is that you ?
yeah , it &apos;s me , ma .
surprise !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home .
now you can help me decide .
i was , um , cleaning out the basement ,
and i found these cans of paint .
and you know your father
he never throws anything out .
ma , this is my home .
i know ! look .
marmalade , wild orchid , or begonia .
what , you -- you don &apos;t like any of these ?
that &apos;s okay -- we &apos;ll get a different color ,
make it feel more like you
this reminds me of the time that i asked for a bunk bed
and you surprised me with a pink canopy .
i thought you loved that bed .
i asked for a bunk bed
because i wanted to build a fort , ma ,
and i didn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings .
i wish you knew i hate pink .
it &apos;s begonia !
then i hate begonia , too .
ma , all right .
ma .
aw , come on , ma .
i want you to know , missy ,
i got stretch marks for you .
marmalade is the new black .
if you say anything like that to my mother when you see her ...
like what ?
like encouraging or supportive , i will ...
you will ...
hmm , well , korsak will arrest you if you kill me ,
so you will paint my house wild orchid ?
exactly .
she was just trying to help .
no , she &apos;s trying to find something to do with her life .
what is that ?
broccoli particulates , salmon .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s farmed or wild @-@ caught .
ugh , what a drag .
we would have solved the case like that .
no , the blue thing .
what is it ? is it a pill ? what is that ?
it &apos;s more teal than blue .
you know , a stomach &apos;s contents are like someone &apos;s grocery bag .
it &apos;s so revealing .
it &apos;s my favorite part .
gosh , mine , too .
except the intestines .
i do not know how you can enjoy doing an autopsy .
well , i &apos;m distracting myself to do this one , jane .
i &apos;m thinking about that baby , too .
yeah . i called the hospital .
he &apos;s still critical . i may go see him tonight .
i saw him this morning .
really ?
are we getting ...
what , cravings for pickles ? no .
one stab wound ?
yep . lacerated right pulmonary artery .
cause of death -- exsanguination .
how long it take her to bleed out ?
3 or 4 minutes .
so she was with us 4 minutes after she was attacked .
well , might not have been
the first time that she was attacked .
i found evidence of healed fractures to the mandible .
someone broke her jaw ?
hey , found the motel that issued this .
great . let &apos;s go . i &apos;ll see you later , okay ?
police ! open up !
clear .
lousy maid service . good for us .
looks like she was here alone , yeah ?
yeah , looks like it .
what do you got ?
suitcase .
and i got a purse .
wallet .
huh . think she &apos;s canadian ?
no , she &apos;s a local . tracy kelly .
tracy ? she checked in as mary smith .
well , then tracy kelly is hiding from someone .
abusive boyfriend ?
or a husband .
i &apos;m female .
yes . yes , you are .
what &apos;s the fastest way to push this guy &apos;s buttons ?
let &apos;s mix it up .
you be good cop .
i &apos;ll be black cop .
bold choice .
sit down .
thank you for driving all the way in from new brunswick .
that &apos;s , what , six hours away ?
what do you do there ?
commercial fisherman .
you know who killed my wife ?
where were you yesterday ?
where the hell you think i was ?
on a boat off canada .
any idea why your wife was living in a motel
under the name mary smith ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
she hiding from you , hank ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean , huh ?
hey , hey , sit down . sit down .
we know you &apos;re upset , mr. kelly .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
oh , yeah , you look like you &apos;re real sorry .
you can take some consolation
in the fact that your son survived .
i don &apos;t have a son .
your wife was 8 months &apos; pregnant .
she was carrying a baby boy .
we were able to save him .
you didn &apos;t know she was pregnant .
no .
i spend most of the year out at sea , so , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry to have to ask you this , mr. kelly .
when &apos;s the last time you had sex with your wife ?
whoa , whoa .
whoa . answer the question .
10 months .
why don &apos;t you talk to the guy who knocked up my wife ?
maybe he did it .
let &apos;s get a blood sample .
hey . can you look at our suspect &apos;s blood @-@ test results ?
he says he &apos;s not the baby &apos;s father .
he &apos;s not .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
tell that to your face . it looks pretty bothered .
every person has their a.b.o. blood type
determined by each parent .
tracy kelly &apos;s blood type is a
okay .
and baby john doe &apos;s blood type is o @-@ positive .
sum it up for me , maura .
his mother couldn &apos;t be type &quot; a. &quot;
tracy &apos;s not the baby &apos;s mother .
tracy kelly seems to been a gestational surrogate .
is that the only possibility ?
yeah , maybe tracy can &apos;t get pregnant with hank .
yeah , and decides to do in @-@ vitro with donor eggs and sperm .
no , no . she had quite robust reproductive organs .
do you find that sexy in a woman ?
&quot; robust reproductive organs &quot; ?
first thing i look for .
wait a minute . this is fantastic .
tracy was carrying somebody else &apos;s baby .
which means that baby john doe has parents .
well , biological parents , not social parents .
it &apos;s not the same thing , but --
i was adopted .
my real parents were the ones that raised me .
you know , nature / nurture , biological / social .
either one is fine with me ,
as long as we find a loving mommy and daddy for that baby .
okay , look at tracy &apos;s bank account .
$ 2,000 in cash deposits once a month .
for eight months .
$ 16,000 just does not seem like enough compensation
for stretch marks .
and why does my mom blame me ?
she had three kids .
looks like it was a lot of money for tracy kelly .
did you find her medical records ?
nothing so far .
her mandibular fracture was surgically treated
by a closed reduction ,
so there should be records of that surgery somewhere .
yeah , in delaware .
tracy &apos;s name popped up in a state police report .
she was treated in the emergency room .
for a domestic ?
no .
motor @-@ vehicle accident . t @-@ boned by a truck .
so hank didn &apos;t break her jaw .
i got more -- vessel records confirm
hank was a mile offshore when his wife was killed .
well , someone with some kind of training
implanted the fertilized egg in tracy .
i mean , it &apos;s not exactly a do @-@ it @-@ yourself .
the undigested teal capsule in her stomach
had 1,000 micrograms of folate in it .
that &apos;s a prescription prenatal vitamin .
we find the supplier ,
we find the doctor they were supplied to .
hey , uh , how you doing ?
you two dating ?
look , your brother asked to shadow me .
you know , gear up for the detectives &apos; test .
why didn &apos;t you ask me ?
what , because he &apos;s a sergeant now ?
will you stop that ?
i got promoted , but nothing has changed .
yeah , plus we got boundary issues .
yeah , boundary issues .
what boundary issues ?
come on . hey , speaking of that ,
have you seen this ?
ma &apos;s having a yard sale tomorrow .
what ?
oh , read the fine print .
at my house ? ! come on !
b.p.d. know you blocked off half my street ?
what was i supposed to do ?
dad &apos;s having a competing yard sale at the house .
what a jerk .
try to be nice ?
i &apos;m always nice .
what a fabulous idea it is to have a yard sale at my house .
why don &apos;t you just bring down all the horrible gifts
i &apos;ve ever given you ?
and you can just sell them .
come on , ma .
i &apos;m sorry . how can i help ?
start pricing .
ladies , ladies , i specifically said , &quot; no early birds . &quot;
how much for these ?
uh , $ 2 .
how about 50 cents ?
that thing is nicer than my car .
it probably converts into a tractor @-@ trailer .
2 bucks .
what ?
what &apos;d i say ?
you &apos;re not very good at sales .
that stroller cost 300 bucks , easy .
uh , $ 1,049.99 .
oh , and how do we know that ?
maura ?
have you been shopping for baby stuff ?
no .
no , i was online , buying a necklace ,
and the baby store was just a click away ,
so i -- i was looking .
well , stop . you don &apos;t have a baby .
yet .
trust me , i did a lot of babysitting .
babies aren &apos;t accessories .
i do not think they &apos;re accessories .
do you like that ?
well , it &apos;s -- i mean , i &apos;m surprised that it &apos;s --
surprised it &apos;s still here , right ?
that somebody hasn &apos;t snatched it up .
beautiful , huh ?
yes . it &apos;s unusual .
it &apos;s , um ... who &apos;s the artist ?
me .
wow .
it &apos;s a landscape .
it &apos;s our backyard , and those are the two swings .
i was gonna ask for five .
hundred ?
it &apos;s priceless . yes . let me .
hey .
hey . a lot of stuff .
i know .
thanks .
thanks , maura .
hmm . what can i do ?
um , you can take this to the toy table , over there .
no . no !
guardian chogokin .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ll give you 100 bucks for it .
sold . really , i &apos;m not good at sales ?
$ 120 .
it &apos;s not i.t.b.
&quot; in the box . &quot;
more valuable , the less it &apos;s played with .
you know , he is a steal at $ 120,
detective frost .
showoff .
thank you .
oh , no , no , no .
chogokin goes in the &quot; keep &quot; pile .
frankie , that doll has been in the basement
for 20 years .
it &apos;s not a doll . it &apos;s an action figure .
give me it , frost .
i just bought this .
frankie , stop it .
frost , take the doll .
action figure .
whatever . all right ?
we &apos;re here to help ma ,
not take a trip down toy lane with you two .
dr. isles .
yeah , frankie , help your family .
come on . let me see it . come here .
thank you .
the crime lab just isolated the dyes
used in tracy &apos;s prenatal vitamins ,
and they were custom @-@ designed
for a fertility clinic on beacon hill .
pretty busy for a saturday .
looks like there &apos;s a lot of money in making babies .
hi . can i help you ?
uh , yes , we &apos;re --
as one of the fertility specialists here ,
i just have to tell you
that biracial couples make the most beautiful babies .
no . no , no , no .
we &apos;re , uh -- we &apos;re boston homicide ,
and we are investigating a murder .
we need to speak to your clinic &apos;s director , please .
oh , uh , dr. hanson -- he &apos;s with a patient .
we really need to speak to him .
okay . follow me .
all righty .
you want kids , frost ?
yeah , but i &apos;m in no rush .
tony randall had one
at 77 , right ?
yeah , but tony didn &apos;t do all that much .
i think it was more the 27 @-@ year @-@ old wife .
yeah .
go , tony .
what &apos;s with the footwear ?
thank you .
i &apos;m dr. hanson . how can i help you ?
we need to know if tracy kelly
was a patient here .
may i ask what this is regarding ?
we &apos;re investigating her murder .
we have reason to believe that
she was treated at your clinic .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t recognize her .
randi , my nurse , has most of the contact
with our prospective parents .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a client waiting .
&quot; clients &quot; ?
really ?
do you recognize her ?
we have so many . s @-@ she doesn &apos;t seem familiar .
her name was tracy kelly .
she was 34 weeks pregnant .
she was taking prenatal vitamins provided
by this clinic .
i wonder why she doesn &apos;t seem familiar .
maybe someone gave them to her ?
a lot of our moms give away
unused stuff once they deliver .
i &apos;d like a list of your clients .
well , i &apos;m sure you understand ,
our confidentiality policy means
i can &apos;t just give it to you .
we can get a court order .
that would be best .
and i am serious , biracial couples --
mmm -- such cute babies .
thanks .
we &apos;re good .
it must be hard when your children grow up .
well , they were the only thing i was ever good at .
oh , that &apos;s not true .
what , jane said i wasn &apos;t a good mother ?
no . no , no , no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
i @-@ i @-@ i just meant that you &apos;re great at lots of things ,
like cooking and cleaning .
you should see me with a baby .
hey , korsak , want to be a godfather ?
would you knock it off ?
quit being funny like an hour ago .
i &apos;ve been working at home .
i got good news for you
a match for the baby &apos;s dna .
went through two color cartridges
trying to print this out .
put it through as an informant fee .
yeah , and get fired ?
this guy -- mitch tolliver ,
doing time for a felony .
how is that good news that baby john doe &apos;s daddy is a con ?
mitch is the evil twin .
this is his identical twin brother ,
the good one -- jim .
jim &apos;s a teacher .
he and his wife have been trying to have a kid .
i was never able to carry a term .
i- my eggs were fine and jim is healthy .
but i just kept having miscarriages .
i &apos;m sorry .
we had nearly given up hope .
on two teachers &apos; salaries ,
we didn &apos;t think we could afford fertility treatments .
how did you afford dr. hanson ?
he arranged for us to get a second mortgage on our house .
um , did dr. hanson introduce you to the surrogate ?
yes . tracy was a really nice girl .
she called all the time ,
made sure that we had ultrasound photos .
that &apos;s our baby .
that &apos;s james jr .
we , um , we were beside ourselves when the clinic called
and told us that tracy had miscarried .
mr. and mrs. tolliver , your baby is still alive .
what ?
is your mother ...
breast @-@ feeding .
your mother is the most wonderful kangaroo volunteer .
i don &apos;t think i should be here .
my mother is a kangaroo ?
well , studies have shown that neonates thrive
when there &apos;s skin @-@ to @-@ skin contact .
so , i arranged for your mom to be a volunteer kangaroo .
and thanks to her , baby john doe &apos;s vitals have stabilized .
she looks so happy .
i bet she looked that happy holding you .
that &apos;s your son .
that &apos;s him ?
that &apos;s our baby ?
you can go in as soon as the court awards custody .
thank you . thank you so much .
thank you .
congratulations .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s still alive .
we have a son .
they named him james jr .
hey , korsak .
jane , we got a problem .
detective rizzoli , these are the paysons .
hi .
hi .
nice to meet you .
hi .
they came looking for baby john doe .
we &apos;re his parents .
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re going to need to do some dna testing .
why ?
because there is another family
claiming that this is their baby , as well .
oh , you know , i can clear that right up .
he &apos;s not our biological child , but he &apos;s ours .
we arranged a legal adoption through dream babies .
what were you told about the birth parents ?
that the mother was young and single
and didn &apos;t have the means to care for a child .
but , um , we do .
we want to be parents .
and then , when we found russell ,
uh , our prayers were answered .
yeah .
and how did you find this russell ?
online .
in fact , most of the arrangements were made that way .
we just met with him once to sign the paperwork .
you paid $ 75,000 ?
half of the private adoption fee .
we paid the attorney &apos;s fees and the mother &apos;s expenses .
it &apos;s all legal .
and you started the adoption process two weeks ago ?
well , we &apos;d been disappointed so many times .
i just , uh , i just couldn &apos;t stand waiting anymore .
when russell showed us tracy &apos;s picture , i --
we were happy to pay .
yeah .
then russell stopped returning our phone calls ,
and then we saw tracy &apos;s photo in the newspaper .
it &apos;s so awful .
is the baby all right ?
i mean , is he , um ...
is he with someone -- someone holding him ?
where is he ? !
where &apos;s our baby ?
call me with the results .
just doesn &apos;t seem fair .
all a blood test tells us is
who baby john doe &apos;s biological parents are .
well , how else are you gonna do it , king solomon ?
you can &apos;t really cut him in half .
well , you could find out who would make the better parents .
you got a test for that ?
ugh . this is a mess !
who killed her ?
i can tell you who the father is . jim tolliver .
oh , good . he had kind eyes .
okay .
but the mother is not linda tolliver .
so , who is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
and we &apos;re back to a mess .
we know tracy needs money . she has no skills .
so she offers herself as a surrogate to dr. hanson .
he implants an egg .
fertilized by mr. tolliver .
and then &quot; russell the lawyer &quot; brings hanson the paysons
with their bigger checkbook .
hanson resells the baby .
huh . check this out .
here &apos;s our dr. hanson .
and here is private adoption attorney russell dempsey .
same guy . huh .
doctor / attorney / con man .
good scam .
i hear someone in distress . hear that ?
that is so old @-@ school .
don &apos;t you have any other tricks ?
anybody smell gas ?
that &apos;s better , sergeant ?
would you rather wait for a warrant , detective ?
why don &apos;t we just go in ?
police ! anybody here ?
i &apos;ll go check the back offices .
looks like they all got out of dodge .
not all of them .
dr. hanson .
he &apos;s dead .
looks like he &apos;s been stabbed .
he &apos;s not the only thing dead in here . watch yourself .
what are we stepping in ?
somebody &apos;s dreams .
a lot of people &apos;s dream babies .
keep on same knife ?
wounds are consistent with the knife that killed tracy ,
but i can &apos;t be sure until i have the knife .
oh , yeah . i knew i forgot something .
it &apos;s ...
maura , if i had the knife , i wouldn &apos;t be asking .
this was a more frenzied attack .
nine stab wounds around the chest area .
so , the person who did this was pretty pissed off .
can you imagine all these desperate people
who want to be parents put their faith in this phony doctor ?
crime techs have logged thousands
of couples &apos; sperm , eggs , and embryos .
okay , i got to go to the b.r.i.c.
i &apos;ll call you later .
hey , your brother &apos;s really good at this .
i had him go over all the video surveillance from the clinic .
yeah , i went through 2,000 hours of footage .
living the dream , frankie .
yeah , well , i found the victim , tracy , and the guy .
you know who that is ?
hanson .
whatever he &apos;s saying is upsetting her .
yeah , he &apos;s real good at this , korsak .
you mean because she &apos;s crying ?
you see why i didn &apos;t want to learn from you ?
will you kids knock it off ? look at this .
hanson and our victim look like lovers .
maybe they were .
maybe that &apos;s why they &apos;re both dead .
so , hank was jealous . that &apos;s a strong motive .
but you wouldn &apos;t know it from his e @-@ mails to tracy .
listen to this .
&quot; you &apos;re my heart . i miss you .
i hate this job . i hate leaving you . &quot;
what &apos;s tracy gonna say ?
&quot; dear hank , i got a job as a walking womb &quot; ?
stop .
oh , hey , oh , look at this .
this was e @-@ mailed to hank
the night that tracy was murdered .
sent anonymously .
you got any more for me to do ?
yeah . cellphone provider sent us
dr. hanson &apos;s deleted voicemail messages .
start listening .
i know guardian chogokin is in your drawer .
he &apos;s going for $ 500 on ebay .
you ripped off my mother .
he doesn &apos;t even have the sword , man .
okay , okay , you know what ?
if it gets you to shut it ,
i &apos;ll give your mom the $ 380 .
he wasn &apos;t for sale .
can you fight over the doll after we &apos;ve solved this murder ?
action figure .
all right , hank &apos;s got a good alibi .
his boat was out to sea the day that tracy was murdered .
vessel logs put it
a mile off the coast of new brunswick .
says hank was on it .
they give a list of the survival equipment ?
why ? what are you thinking ?
commercial fishing boats have to carry survival craft .
there . 16 @-@ foot r.i.b.
with a 25 @-@ horse eggbeater .
well , thank you , popeye ,
but , well , what does that mean ?
it &apos;s a rigid inflatable boat .
a very fast motorized dinghy .
he could &apos;ve gotten to shore in half an hour .
it &apos;s a 6 @-@ hour drive to boston .
just enough time to kill his wife
and then get back to his boat .
you lied . you knew your wife was pregnant .
you want to tell us what else you lied about ?
look , i didn &apos;t say anything cause i knew it would look bad .
yeah , it looks bad .
i waited for her at our house .
she never came home .
so i drove back to new brunswick .
you took a dinghy a mile through choppy water ,
drove 400 miles , and then just turned around
when you couldn &apos;t find your unfaithful wife ?
yeah , jury &apos;s not gonna like that alibi .
look , i know it sounds crazy ...
but i loved tracy .
i would have forgiven her .
hey , can i see you for a sec ?
yeah , sure .
i must have listened to 300 phone messages .
do you hear me complaining ?
hi , it &apos;s tracy kelly .
i told you , i only did this so
my husband could quit his job .
he &apos;s the tollivers &apos; baby .
please , can you all stop calling me ?
she was trying to reunite with hank .
she became a surrogate to bring him back home .
why didn &apos;t she tell him ? she might still be alive .
play that last part again .
please , can you all stop calling me ?
who else was calling her ? and why ?
i want to look through the clinic &apos;s medical records .
damn , there &apos;s a lot of women who want kids .
hmm . men , too , korsak .
you know what bugs me about this whole thing ?
you know what it takes to get these eggs ?
is this a trick question ?
months of painful shots and surgical extractions .
well , the fathers go through stuff , too .
what ? too tough to read the magazine ?
hey , there &apos;s nothing fun about doing it with a magazine .
well , depends on the magazine , right ?
really ?
really ?
hey , frost , remember that nurse we met -
randi gordon ,
the one who said we &apos;d make beautiful babies together ?
she helped herself to jim tolliver &apos;s sperm .
is that legal ?
no .
it &apos;s an employee 5 @-@ finger discount .
well , records show three ivf procedures
for randi at the clinic .
none of them took .
clear .
she was definitely getting ready for the surrogacy stork .
uh , jane ?
yeah ?
i think i found ...
she thought of everything .
she faked nine months of pregnancy
so nobody would bat an eye
when she showed up with a baby .
okay , uh , let &apos;s issue a bolo on randi gordon .
i want somebody watching that baby .
hey , where are you ?
why do you ask ?
thank god you &apos;re terrible at lying .
you &apos;re playing mommy kangaroo ,
aren &apos;t you ?
oh , how did you know ?
listen , do not let that baby out of your sight .
i &apos;m on my way . okay ?
no phones in the nicu .
oh , jane , i have to go .
um , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m a kangaroo care volunteer .
it &apos;s all right , yeah .
okay .
i should feel a surge of prolactin .
i think that &apos;s it .
no , that &apos;s oxytocin .
i &apos;ll take the baby . it &apos;s time for his feeding .
can i feed him ?
let &apos;s go . we &apos;re gonna say hi to jane .
okay .
hi .
hi .
you want to feed him ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m glad he &apos;s okay .
uh , excuse me , can you call your head of security , please ?
i need to speak to him .
here .
you go ahead and hold him while you tell me what &apos;s going on .
maura ...
come on , here you go .
it &apos;ll help calm you down .
he &apos;s so ... less blue .
can you feel it ?
feel what ?
a surge of oxytocin , the mothering hormone .
primates also secrete it during sexual intercourse .
maura .
take the baby .
give him to me .
give him to me !
no , please don &apos;t hurt this baby .
maura , don &apos;t .
his parents wanted him so badly .
they &apos;re not his parents ! i am his mother !
you used your egg and jim tolliver &apos;s sperm ,
and you -- you watched that baby grow in --
in tracy kelly &apos;s womb .
i would have paid her .
tracy didn &apos;t want your money .
she wanted the tollivers to have this baby .
that &apos;s when you decided to kill her and frame her husband .
he &apos;s my baby ! give him to me .
you planned on killing tracy , didn &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re a nurse .
you knew that you had 3 minutes
from the time you slit her throat to get that baby out .
my baby !
maura !
i &apos;m his mother !
drop it ! drop that scalpel now !
i will shoot you , i swear . drop it .
do it now !
get security up to nicu . now !
why do women fake pregnancies ?
all sorts of reasons --
pain over infertility ,
denial , attention @-@ seeking .
couldn &apos;t believe it
when you put yourself between nurse whack @-@ job randi
and the baby . it was just ...
well , you protected him , too .
well , i mean , i just --
i never really saw you as the maternal type , you know .
you didn &apos;t ?
i &apos;ve always seen you as the maternal type .
are you lying ?
yes .
i hope you get hives .
the clay will prevent a histamine reaction .
wasn &apos;t it wonderful to see mrs. tolliver holding the baby ?
she didn &apos;t care whose egg or sperm was responsible .
yes , it was wonderful . now , please be quiet .
i &apos;m trying to enjoy my dirt bath .
clay .
i &apos;m sorry , did you just shush me ?
yes ! shh . where is my lemon water ?
why do you get to keep on talking ?
