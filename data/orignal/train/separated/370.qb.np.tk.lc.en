太公跟班小泡泡
brothers hotchner
yesterday while we were in florida ,
a body was found in the desert
outside las cruces , new mexico .
a man had his leg amputated
and replaced with the leg of someone else .
someone &apos;s out there mimicking the crimes we &apos;ve solved .
this is now an active case ,
which we &apos;ll be investigating along with our other cases .
hello , i &apos;m still here .
zug ... zwang .
it &apos;s a chess term . it describes the point in the game
when a player realizes he &apos;ll inevitably be checkmated .
both the director and the attorney general
want to take you off this case .
we know this case better than anyone .
guess what just came to the reception desk
for an agent jennifer jareau .
zugzwang .
who sent it ?
they knew you would be at that phone booth .
what if this is the replicator ?
the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me .
if it &apos;s directed at one of us ,
it &apos;s directed at all of us .
first he was chasing us ,
and now it &apos;s our turn to chase him .
this psychopath &apos;s message is clearly personal .
you &apos;re victims now .
i had a meeting with the director .
you have no fresh leads .
he wants the replicator classified inactive .
erin , he &apos;s stalking this team .
no one &apos;s going to give it up .
i know that .
and neither will i.
hey , hotch , i need an override .
hotch !
i told you not to all me that .
i need an override .
i can &apos;t help you . thane &apos;s got the card .
you know where he is ?
i &apos;ll give you one guess .
i &apos;m thirsty .
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
is it hot in here ?
oh , yeah , it is .
you &apos;re too hot .
who &apos;s that ?
thane ?
what do you want , hotchner ?
i need the override card .
i &apos;m a little busy .
yeah , i get that .
it &apos;s a 5g tab . we don &apos;t want &apos; em to walk .
uh , just ...
thought i told you not to bug me .
i &apos;m not the only one with a card .
jim &apos;s in a meeting .
what meeting ?
i don &apos;t know . a meeting .
you got the card or what ?
i need some water .
yeah , yeah , just a second .
bloody hell !
i don &apos;t feel so good .
sean ! sean , get in here !
what the hell did this ?
call 911 !
she &apos;s not breathing .
what the hell are you doing ? call for help !
i do not .
ok , you don &apos;t .
do i , really ?
well , just a little . and i &apos;m used to it ,
&apos;cause jack can babble all night long in his sleep .
usually he &apos;s talking about superheroes , though .
what do i talk about ?
mm , you don &apos;t want to know .
aaron !
he just got to sleep .
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re finally doing this .
me , too .
i cannot wait to show him the city .
he &apos;s so excited .
what did you think of my itinerary ?
um , which page ?
oh ... i went all overboard , didn &apos;t i ?
it &apos;s a little ambitious .
that &apos;s ok .
we &apos;ll take it easy and play it by ear , ok ?
we &apos;ll play it by this ear .
oh . this one ?
i just--i really want this weekend
to be memorable for both of you .
it already is .
it &apos;s hard not living in the same city .
i know .
but i think we &apos;re making it work . right ?
i think we are .
did you forget to tell dave that you were on vacation ?
it &apos;s sean .
your brother sean ?
jim peters . i own the place .
aaron , uh , thank god .
i got mixed up in something . i need your help .
what happened ?
this girl , she died right in my arms .
look , i need to see you .
sean , if you &apos;re a witness to something , you need to stay put .
i &apos;m in manhattan . i &apos;ll come to you .
what , you &apos;re here ? since when ?
where are you ?
club called the edinburgh .
8th and 54th .
all right , i &apos;m on my way . i &apos;ll text you when i &apos;m close .
that sounded serious .
yeah , with sean it usually is .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll keep you posted .
will you keep an eye on jack ?
of course .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
he &apos;s your brother .
yeah . that &apos;s why i &apos;m worried .
i didn &apos;t think you could still smoke in new york .
you &apos;re not even gonna warm up to the big brother act ?
i figured it &apos;d save us time .
how long you been in the city ?
jack and i got here today .
jack .
i haven &apos;t seen him since he was ...
3 .
right . and now he &apos;s , uh ...
7 .
so this is where you work now ?
what happened to the restaurant ?
that was a long time ago .
i &apos;m a bartender now .
what happened tonight ?
the girl who died , anna ,
cops think she od &apos;d on ecstasy .
and you think they &apos;re wrong ?
she--she was bleeding ,
out of everything .
my manager wouldn &apos;t let me
call 911 until we got her outside ,
and by that time she was already dead .
cops ask you why you waited to call them ?
they &apos;d already written it off .
cops said they see people overdose
in clubs all the time .
and there &apos;re probably other cases like this one .
i &apos;ll talk to them .
there was .
linda heying .
she died last week .
how well did you know her ?
we worked together .
she probably got her supply from the same place .
there &apos;s enough of it around here .
and everybody looks the other way .
yeah . if we want to keep our jobs .
linda wasn &apos;t using .
how do you know ?
she was my girlfriend .
and the m.e. reports showed 3 other victims
bleeding out over the last week .
yeah . one in harlem , two in the village ,
all 5 of them categorized as ecstasy overdoses .
and one of the victims may have been drugged without her knowledge .
ecstasy is frequently used as a date rape drug ,
but i &apos;ve never seen it cause bleeding like this .
could it be a bad batch ?
according to the m.e. ,
the victims had so much mdma in their systems that it caused their
internal body temperature to go out of control .
they boiled from the inside out .
that &apos;s not typical of overdose victims either .
we could be looking at product tampering ,
similar to the tylenol cyanide poisoning in &apos; 86 .
and the working theory in that case
was that the unsub targeted a specific victim
but dosed mass quantities to cover his tracks .
so you &apos;re telling me these deaths could just be the start .
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;d like the team to join me in new york as soon as possible .
we &apos;re on our way , aaron .
thanks .
you &apos;re coming , aren &apos;t you ?
just as a precaution .
this team tends to go rogue
when loved ones are involved .
&quot; rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof . &quot;
richard bach .
this is more than product tampering .
this is mass murder .
overdosing certainly seems like a hard sell now .
how is he taking out experienced partiers
and non @-@ drug users at the same time ?
he has to be dosing his victims without their knowledge somehow .
ecstasy can be made in pill , powder , and liquid form .
it wouldn &apos;t be that hard to slip something into someone &apos;s drink
or to convince them the pill they &apos;re taking is safe .
so even regular users might not know
they &apos;re being dosed until it &apos;s too late .
why kill in such a graphic manner ?
well , he gets off on the spectacle .
it &apos;s not just about the victims with this guy .
it &apos;s about the witnesses . he incites fear .
which means the unsub is desperate for attention ,
and he wants all eyes on his work
because he craves recognition .
he &apos;ll be paying close attention to the media , then .
it allows him to relive his crimes .
you know , the medium of his kill is interesting .
he &apos;s picking a drug that &apos;s known for its euphoric effect .
it &apos;s like he wants to take that happiness away .
well , it can &apos;t be a coincidence
that the majority of his victims are known drug users .
he &apos;s taking the law into his own hands .
but what about the two who were clean ?
linda heying and erik sullivan &apos;s families
insist they never touched the stuff .
either the victims are good at hiding the truth
or the unsub &apos;s killing for another reason .
we should take a closer look and see how they &apos;re connected .
i &apos;m gonna have to try to meet up with you guys later .
this is a bit of a mess .
we &apos;ve got 11 victims ,
and sean seems to be mixed up in it somehow .
well , don &apos;t worry about us , then . we &apos;ll be fine .
ok . can you put jack on ?
sure .
it &apos;s your dad .
hi , dad .
hey , buddy . i &apos;m gonna have to be late .
you &apos;ll miss the statue of liberty .
i know . and i &apos;m really disappointed .
i was looking forward to the boat ride out there .
i &apos;m sorry i have to work , jack .
this is the part of my job that stinks .
it &apos;s ok , dad . if someone &apos;s in trouble ,
you should help them .
i appreciate that . take lots of pictures for me , ok ?
i will .
thanks for doing this . i &apos;m really sorry .
oh , are you kidding ?
i &apos;m excited about a little quality one @-@ on @-@ one with jack .
go help your brother .
thanks . i love you .
love you , too .
bye .
6 kids died at a rave last night .
they bled out just like the others .
damn .
how well do you know these people you &apos;re working with ?
thane hooked me up with the job a couple of months ago .
linda and i started dating a few weeks after that .
you suspect any of the employees of dealing ?
no , but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s hard to find if you &apos;re looking .
and you &apos;d tell me if you were involved in anything illegal ?
yes , but i &apos;m not .
i swear , aaron .
and you &apos;ve told me everything ?
all right , you did the right thing in calling .
i &apos;ll let you know what we find out .
well , this guy &apos;s definitely making a statement .
to us or to them ?
it &apos;s the drug .
did you and your friends take the same pills ?
yeah . but it wasn &apos;t pills . it was liquid x .
i &apos;m just trying to understand
why the drug killed your friends and not you .
did they take a lot more than you ?
why was that ?
they had more money .
why would you want more doses ?
i mean , it appears that the drug had its intended effect .
eventually , yeah .
but it took forever and the others didn &apos;t want to wait .
and how long does it normally take ?
an hour , maybe .
but this stuff was different .
it took nearly double that .
so your friends bought more doses ,
thinking the batch they &apos;d taken was weak .
how much more did they take ? do you know ?
two vials , each .
do you think you &apos;d be able to describe the person
you bought the ecstasy from ?
don &apos;t have to .
he &apos;s right over there .
thanks .
the delayed onset of the drug caused the victims to o.d. themselves .
well , that explains why the victims boiled .
the higher the dose , the higher the heat .
maybe it was designed that way .
according to the m.e. report ,
the ecstasy was cut with a high volume of methamphetamine .
go for greatness .
hey , baby girl .
i need you to run a search on delayed onset mdma .
methamphetamine mixtures .
see if you can find anything about--
whoa .
what ?
double oh to the whoa to the oh whoa power .
there &apos;s a drug called para @-@ methox ... ish ...
para @-@ methoxymethamphetamine ?
yes . what you just said . pmma for short .
it just hit the international market .
its street name , which i &apos;m not making up , is doctor death .
so coined because the drug keeps killing people .
apparently it &apos;s produced with such a huge percentage of meth ,
it masks the effects of the ecstasy
until the user &apos;s already taken too much .
mdma costs more to make than methamphetamine ,
so it &apos;s common practice to mix the two in creating ecstasy
in order to maximize the profit margins .
like watering down liquor ,
except in this case , the water kills you .
so is this pmma coming straight from the manufacturer ,
or is our unsub altering the drug supply
to make it more lethal ?
thank you .
that was the dea .
they &apos;re very concerned .
this is the first evidence
of pmma making its way into the united states .
and they have no idea where it &apos;s coming from ?
no . they &apos;ve increased border patrol ,
they &apos;ve heightened security at the airports .
that doesn &apos;t help us
if it &apos;s being made here .
well , still , if it weren &apos;t for your brother ,
we might not have made the connection .
i have some reservations .
what are you going to do ?
i asked dave to talk to him .
well , that &apos;ll do it .
where &apos;s aaron ?
in cases where family &apos;s involved ,
we like to have an unbiased agent
conduct the interview .
am i a suspect ?
should you be ?
um , how well did you know linda ?
we used to date .
date ?
you told agent hotchner that she was your girlfriend .
she was .
then it ... stopped .
you two broke up , then ?
no , it &apos;s not like that .
well , what stopped , then , the sex ?
look , what linda and i were or weren &apos;t isn &apos;t gonna help you .
i think you should let me decide what &apos;s going to help .
we had a fight .
it was bad . but we were getting over it ,
getting back to normal .
what was the fight about ?
my using .
you &apos;re a drug addict ?
i don &apos;t use anymore .
linda convinced me to get clean .
how long ago was that ?
two months ago .
any relapses ?
not in the last two months .
what was your drug of choice ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
you &apos;d rather not say ?
are you serious ? people are dying , sean .
it was ecstasy .
you said you told me everything .
i stopped using . i didn &apos;t think it mattered .
it does matter . where were you getting the drugs ?
from thane .
so you &apos;re protecting him .
no . look , it &apos;s not like that .
i met him a few years ago .
when i lost the catering gig , he gave me a job .
thane may be a dumbass , but he doesn &apos;t kill people .
does it not occur to you
that if thane has access to the drug supply ,
he might also have access to the person doing this ?
i didn &apos;t think--
no , you didn &apos;t think . what else are you hiding ?
nothing !
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
i don &apos;t understand .
we buried my brother a week ago .
well , other people have died ,
and we &apos;re worried that
there may be a connection to what happened to your brother .
i knew it .
the cops tried telling us he died of a drug overdose .
but you didn &apos;t believe them .
erik didn &apos;t do drugs .
he wouldn &apos;t .
why is that ?
our dad used to get high before he &apos;d beat us .
you told police that you were partying the night he died .
yeah , we were just drinking wine .
that &apos;s all .
do you remember what kind ?
not the brand or anything .
i got a bottle of red , he got white .
while you &apos;re topping off ...
did you wash your hands ?
yes .
you know the rules .
thank you for the world so sweet ,
thank you for the food we eat .
thank you for the birds that sing ,
thank you , god , for everything .
amen .
mom ! dad !
ecstasy isn &apos;t exactly an appetizer .
you know , kimberly sullivan said she and her brother
were drinking wine the night he died .
it &apos;s almost empty .
do you mind ? thanks .
the unsub wants to increase his body count .
he doesn &apos;t care who he hurts .
a startling development tonight in manhattan
where two parents died of
an apparent drug overdose in front of their daughter .
bernard and catherine hatchitt bled out at the dinner table
in what is being categorized as
a deadly reaction to ecstasy and methamphetamine .
federal investigators arrived on the scene when it was discovered
the illegal substance was inside the wine
the couple had been drinking .
their daughter has been moved into protective custody
pending the outcome of the investigation ,
and next of kin ...
i hope you saved me for dessert .
morgan isn &apos;t here , baby girl .
oh . i knew that . that was for you .
tell us you found something .
how about a sequel to &quot; the grapes of wrath &quot; ?
i tracked the wine bottles both erik sullivan
and the hatchitt family were drinking , and look out ,
&apos;cause those bottles were in cases shipped to the edinburgh .
why would someone at the bar drug the wine ?
maybe it occurred at the bottling plant .
there &apos;s no way to track where a specific case is going to
until after it &apos;s been offloaded .
yeah . and it doesn &apos;t explain the rave victims .
it would if we &apos;re dealing with two unsubs .
one who alters the drug , another who doses the wine .
but if someone at the club is spiking the wine ,
how is it ending up in the hands
of two manhattan parents and one underage boy in harlem ?
garcia , did any of the wine victims make transactions at the edinburgh ?
nothing that &apos;s obvious . i &apos;ll keep checking .
beep beep .
ok . so ...
we have 5 overdose victims
we can connect directly to the edinburgh ,
a club that condones drug use .
the answer is there .
let me call you back .
thanks .
i heard about those parents .
i want to help .
what do you know ?
we think somebody at the edinburgh
is dosing bottles of wine with tampered ecstasy .
why ? to murder someone ?
well , if they know the drugs have been tampered with , yes .
if not , they could be using it as a date rape drug .
does that sound like something thane would do ?
yeah . i &apos;ve seen him do it .
but he freaked out when he saw what happened to anna .
he definitely didn &apos;t know .
who do you think it could be ?
someone farther up the supply chain .
thane might know who it is .
i could help you find out .
how &apos;s that ?
i know the guy . i can ask him where he gets his drugs .
then that might tip off the real unsub .
well , couldn &apos;t you put a wire on me ?
i can do it without making him suspicious .
no , sean . you have no training . i &apos;m not gonna do that .
and if thane knows more than we think he does ,
it &apos;s too risky .
i &apos;m telling you , i can do this .
just give me the chance .
once you tell thane that the police questioned you ,
you &apos;ll have his attention .
ask him what you &apos;re supposed to say to them
if they want to talk to you again .
we need some idea of how the operation &apos;s organized .
he &apos;s not gonna just give that up .
well , if you create the right circumstances , he might .
the edinburgh &apos;s had a lot of attention right now
because of the deaths , and that &apos;s not good for business .
and you need to make the situation sound as bad as possible .
yeah , but won &apos;t he panic ?
well , without jeopardizing your safety ,
that &apos;s exactly what we want him to do .
even with the spotlight of the investigation ,
the club still needs to make money .
and that means continuing to sell the drugs .
thane &apos;s already on edge .
somebody &apos;s probably pressuring him to make all this go away .
which is why he &apos;ll be desperate to know
what you &apos;ve said to the police .
thane needs somebody on his side right now ,
and the more that you can assure him you &apos;re a team player ,
the more he &apos;s gonna confide in you .
how do you feel ?
fine . i &apos;m ready .
all right , good . let &apos;s do it .
you &apos;re late , hotchner .
sorry . sorry , i got held up by the cops .
you what ?
they called . they wanted to ask a few more questions .
oh , they did , did they ?
and what did you tell them , sean ?
uh ... i told them exactly how it happened , jim .
that girl started screaming about being too hot ,
thane and i got her some water ,
got her outside to cool off ,
and she collapsed .
you &apos;re a good man , sean .
you understand , we just don &apos;t want them shutting the place down .
club like this one closed a few days , we &apos;re finished for good .
look , fellas , i like my job .
i &apos;m not about to do anything to jeopardize that .
why did they call you in and not me ?
i guess &apos; cause i &apos;m the bartender .
i don &apos;t know , they were ...
talking about some bad wine or something .
i tell you , it &apos;s a good thing i got sober .
i had no idea wine could do that to a person .
i just wish i had known that linda had started drinking again .
then maybe i ...
could have done something to help before it was too late .
that couldn &apos;t have been easy for him .
they connected that girl to linda ?
maybe you should dump that wine just to be safe .
yeah . hey , sean . come with me . give me a hand .
he know anything ?
i &apos;m not sure .
start with these .
you don &apos;t want to dump the whole case ?
uh , no , just-- just those two .
something wrong ?
yeah . i , uh ,
i could &apos;ve sworn there was another case of that stuff .
i don &apos;t think so .
no , i &apos;m sure of it .
um , you didn &apos;t notice anything missing
the last time you did inventory ?
no . everything &apos;s here .
no , i &apos;m sure of it . there was ...
another case of the whiteland chard .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , thane ,
but if it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s a good thing , right ?
we just have to dump it .
no ! no , it &apos;s not a good thing .
i need that wine .
where is it ?
it &apos;s not here .
it &apos;s not here !
what did you do , thane ?
i spiked the wine , you idiot .
3 of the bottles were in that other case .
oh , god .
oh , god . jim is gonna kill me .
why the hell would you do that ?
for a laugh . i thought it was x.
girls love that crap .
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t x , was it ?
no , i guess not .
he &apos;s going off plan , hotch .
get ready to move in .
what was in the wine , thane ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , where did you get it ?
what does it matter ? !
linda &apos;s dead because of you .
you son of a bitch . she was sober and you drugged her .
yeah , not as sober as you think .
look , i wouldn &apos;t if i was you .
you had that anna girl &apos;s blood all over you .
you don &apos;t let it go , i &apos;m gonna tell them it was you .
what &apos;s that ?
you bastard .
drop it !
fbi . drop it .
keep your hands where i can see them .
you ...
let &apos;s go .
you all right ?
i &apos;ll wait for you outside .
caught her trying to get out through a grate in the office .
was peters with her ?
not sure . jj and alex are searching the perimeter .
thanks .
the crash didn &apos;t kill him .
someone poured pmma down his nose and throat .
the drug aside , this is a completely different m.o.
he &apos;s no longer content to sit back and watch . why ?
the overkill seems personal .
whoever did this had a definite grudge against peters .
garcia &apos;s running background and financial records on sean .
hotch , you don &apos;t think you &apos;re overreacting ?
he left the edinburgh for a reason .
we need to know why .
you can &apos;t actually think that he did this ?
i don &apos;t , but i can &apos;t eliminate the possibility
until i know what he &apos;s hiding .
maybe we should look at this another way .
we know thane was responsible for dosing the wine .
that was his own plan , not the unsub &apos;s .
so how would a sociopath seeking recognition for his achievements
handle someone interfering with his work ?
he &apos;d put a stop to it .
any way he could .
that was after the hatchitt parents were killed .
as innocent victims , they were the deviation .
so we were wrong . the unsub does care who dies .
instead of targeting thane , the unsub went after peters .
he held him responsible .
he may hold peters responsible for more than thane &apos;s actions .
i &apos;m gonna have garcia dig into his life .
in the meantime , we &apos;ll use that to find out what we can .
well , thane ...
it looks like we have a problem .
yeah ? what &apos;s that , then ?
well , someone &apos;s pretty upset .
your club &apos;s been dosing innocent women .
ok , that was thane &apos;s deal .
he &apos;d been dosing x for years .
but recently it went wrong .
i had nothing to do with that .
you knew it was going on .
that makes you an accessory .
look , i think i &apos;d like my phone call now .
you could do that , sure .
or , we could play a little game called &quot; let &apos;s make a deal . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to make any deals without my lawyer .
yeah , this one you do .
see , this is what somebody did to your boss .
you see , thane , whoever it is that &apos;s out there ,
he managed to get to jim peters outside of his apartment .
the person who did that isn &apos;t very happy right now .
and he is waiting ,
just waiting to get his hands on someone else
connected to your club &apos;s operation .
and you know what we &apos;re gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna let you go .
you &apos;re what ?
what makes you think that if he was able to get to the big boss ,
he &apos;d have any trouble getting his hands on you ?
so , like i said , we &apos;re gonna let you walk right out of here--
all right . i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know .
just ...
you have to protect me .
still no word from sean ?
we &apos;ll find him , aaron .
how does a guy who has everything going for him
make one self @-@ destructive choice after another ?
and then when it seems like he &apos;s gonna get his act together ,
it all falls apart again .
were you two ever close ?
he was in first grade when i was sent off to boarding school .
i was the screw @-@ up making bad choices .
but at a certain point ,
i realized i could either continue to do that
or i could get my act together .
but this doesn &apos;t seem to occur to sean .
i know he didn &apos;t show up for haley &apos;s funeral .
right .
and at that point i decided
i couldn &apos;t make him a priority anymore . i was done .
hello , my pretties .
i have seen the wizard and he granted my wish .
erik sullivan and catherine hatchitt both withdrew money
from the same atm on the day that they died .
that atm is lcated in a bodega
two blocks from the edinburgh .
what you want to bet that &apos;s where they bought their wine ?
good work , garcia .
we &apos;ll send morgan and reid .
yep .
what &apos;d you find ?
well , they didn &apos;t know names ,
but thanks to thane and liz ,
we now have a map of the distribution chain .
the ecstasy was flown from canada into franklin ,
a private airport outside the city .
and then a courier transports the drug supply to 5 drop @-@ off points ,
where the dealers pick up the product
and then sell it to their clients .
and the clients include local clubs and underground party venues .
how many of those clubs were connected to peters ?
two . but only the edinburgh received the tainted x .
all right , let &apos;s find out everything we can about the other club .
how do you expect to stay in business
if you open 20 minutes late every day ?
i got a hangover . what is it to you ?
we &apos;d like to talk to you about your inventory .
we pulled your shipping orders , mr. beaird .
it appears you &apos;re selling more product than you &apos;re taking in .
don &apos;t you guys have anything better to do
than to harass an old shopkeeper ?
yes , actually we do ,
so can we not waste any time ?
where do you get your extra goods ?
private donations .
do those donors include employees of local establishments ?
look , sometimes a guy nicks a bottle
or the supplies from his place of employment
and brings it to me .
if i can sell it ,
i take it off his hands at a bargain price .
does that include cases of wine ?
yeah . i bought one a couple of weeks ago .
funny thing . the guy came back yesterday
and paid the full price for what was left .
strange fellow .
guys , i found something
stranger than a time @-@ traveling police box .
what &apos;s that ?
i ran financial records for all the people
who work at the franklin airport .
there is a baggage handler named mike spires
who &apos;s been making ridiculously large cash deposits
to his checking account on a weekly basis .
here &apos;s what &apos;s weird-- he &apos;s been dead for the last 4 weeks .
so how &apos;s he still making deposits ?
right ?
hotchner .
aaron .
sean , you need to come in .
we think you may be in danger from the unsub .
he &apos;s targeting edinburgh employees .
yeah , i heard about jim peters .
look , i didn &apos;t kill him .
i know that . i also know why you ran .
of course you do .
just come in so that we can protect you .
it &apos;s time to stop running .
solve the case and i &apos;ll stop .
if spires has been dead for a month ,
he can &apos;t be our guy .
why would the dealers keep paying him ?
they don &apos;t know that their courier died .
someone must have taken his place .
the unsub . he killed spires
so he could get his hands on the drug supply .
who else knew he was a courier ?
another package handler ?
sure . they must be on the take , too ,
paid to look the other way .
garcia , do any of the baggage handlers
show a history of drug abuse ?
a few minor infractions , but nothing that sticks out .
all right , widen the search .
have any airport employees
had a drug death in the family recently ?
yeah .
the daughter of larry feretich ,
megan , she died two months ago
of a suspected ecstasy overdose .
there &apos;s your trigger .
where did she die ?
the obsidian .
it &apos;s the other club owned by jim peters .
he &apos;s smart . he avoided dosing the obsidian supply
so we couldn &apos;t connect the murders to him .
garcia , where &apos;s feretich now ?
at the airport .
all right , notify morgan and reid .
larry feretich ?
fbi .
larry feretich , you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of--
he killed my daughter ! he killed megan !
no , he didn &apos;t . a drug killed your daughter .
no , it was jim peters .
i said so , but no one would listen .
thank you .
that was the canadian drug agency .
they closed down operations at their airport .
that &apos;s a relief .
now sean can come out of hiding .
he &apos;s exonerated .
that &apos;s something .
well , i don &apos;t know about you all , but i &apos;m exhausted .
i &apos;m gonna head back to the hotel and take a bath .
i could drive you .
i &apos;m heading that way .
thank you , alex .
so i &apos;ll see everyone on the jet tomorrow .
could you be any more obvious ?
i think i preferred you before you were a profiler .
really ?
here , buddy .
give me that .
come on in .
jack , do you remember uncle sean ?
hey , jack .
it &apos;s been a long time .
hi .
and this is beth .
it &apos;s great to finally meet you .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not like we live in the same city or anything .
jack , how about we go look at all that cool stuff
you got at the museum today , huh ?
ok .
say goodbye to uncle sean , jack .
bye .
bye . i &apos;ll see you soon , huh ?
so how did you know i took the wine ?
i know what you sound like when you tell a lie .
you said something to thane about the wine ,
and i could hear you calming yourself down .
my brother the profiler .
it has more to do with being your brother than being a profiler .
what did you get for the wine ?
100 bucks .
i needed it for rent .
sean , you and i need to do better .
yeah , i want to , aaron .
look , i know what i have to do .
you know any good lawyers ?
i &apos;ve made a couple calls .
there are two officers waiting downstairs .
yeah , i know . i saw them on my way up .
i &apos;ll walk you down .
&quot; cruel is the strife of brothers . &quot;
aristotle .
that &apos;s not right . why is that happening ?
what ...
what--what--
wait--
that &apos;s what the ... that &apos;s what the replicator--
that &apos;s what the replicator said . where is he ?
how did he get in my--
how did he do it ? how did he get in ...
how did he get in ?
the replicator
wait !
kids !
wait for me !
do you really think your team is going to save you ?
i know they will .
did you get everything you wanted ?
what ?
in life .
did you ?
does anyone ?
we should .
that &apos;s the point .
drinking got in your way .
your husband couldn &apos;t help .
though god knows he tried .
you know my husband ?
and your poor children
always played second fiddle to your ambition .
i can &apos;t see .
oh , thank god . david .
he was here . you have to find him .
i will . i promise .
thank you .
all the love in the world won &apos;t save you .
what ?
we &apos;re not finished yet .
the replicator &apos;s here in new york .
he took pictures of us and he hacked into garcia &apos;s system .
i know . i will .
i love you , too .
bye .
hey , garcia .
are you guys ok ?
yeah , yeah . i got derek with me .
we &apos;re meeting everyone at the hotel .
i don &apos;t know how he got in .
i &apos;m gonna shut down the system before the replicator can .
i am so sorry . i check everything .
i upgrade constantly .
it &apos;s not your fault , penelope .
he &apos;s just that good .
and he wanted us to know that he &apos;s here hunting us .
hold on . you got an external override .
and if the only way to get in
is with the pre @-@ authorized hard line
and he didn &apos;t get in via quantico ...
oh , my god .
what ?
he was in my house .
strauss isn &apos;t answering .
keep trying . reid , any word from blake ?
not yet .
the pictures of you were taken outside of beth &apos;s apartment .
i get it if you want to stay with them until we find him .
we &apos;ve got agents surrounding beth &apos;s building .
she and jack are safer without me ,
since we &apos;re the targets .
blake , we &apos;ll pick you up in a few minutes .
the replicator &apos;s back .
you &apos;ve reached erin strauss . please leave me a detailed message .
hey , it &apos;s me again .
i got your text , but i guess you fell asleep .
hotch . something &apos;s wrong .
the window &apos;s open . she &apos;d never sleep like that .
did something happen to make her drink again ?
no ! she was working real hard at--
this represents a year sober .
she hasn &apos;t let go of it since she got it .
she &apos;s even a sponsor now .
the replicator has her . i &apos;ll check the roof .
i &apos;ll have morgan meet you up there .
strauss is missing .
blake , you and reid talk to hotel security .
we need access points and footage from every camera .
morgan , back up dave on the roof .
jj , take the west staircase , i &apos;ll take the east .
erin .
not quite . does it ever get confusing ,
that whole erin / aaron thing ?
where is she ?
closer than you think .
but she &apos;s not doing well .
she looks a bit pale .
remember the last time you got a call like this ?
remember ?
george foyet , right ?
you were too late .
rossi .
what the hell happened ?
her room was a wreck .
she been drinking ?
no .
rossi , you sure ?
look , if the replicator took her , he &apos;s probably long gone .
but he left the window open so we would come up here .
then this is some kind of trap or he wants us to see something .
there she is !
dave ! dave , i &apos;ve got her !
she &apos;s on a bench , she &apos;s a block east of the hotel .
call emts .
erin .
is he armed ?
is he armed ?
erin .
i tried to find you .
it &apos;s ok . help is on the way .
go--
erin , you &apos;ve been drugged . we need to get you to a hospital .
no , i can &apos;t .
erin .
it &apos;s happening so fast .
dave &apos;s called the paramedics .
he said he &apos;s gonna race you home .
does that mean anything to you ?
you have to find him .
it &apos;s so quiet . why is it so quiet ?
erin , did you recognize him ?
he put a gun to my head .
he made me drink .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish i &apos;d let him kill me .
did you know him ?
no .
he knows my family .
he knows my children !
you have to protect my kids !
it &apos;s ok , erin .
you have to find him !
we will . we will . it &apos;s alright . just take a breath .
i love my children .
please tell them .
they know . they know .
once you said i loved my son the most .
that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was wrong .
aaron , i can &apos;t see you .
i &apos;m right here .
i don &apos;t want to die alone .
i &apos;m right here . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
&quot; affliction comes to us
&quot; not to make us sad , but sober ;
&quot; not to make us sorry , but wise . &quot;
h.g. wells .
we &apos;ve got an apb ,
but the description of the replicator is too general .
he wiped out all of the hotel security cameras .
atm and traffic cameras were compromised also .
which means he hacked into at least two dozen systems .
well , he got into garcia &apos;s place ,
which means he can get in anywhere .
this guy &apos;s bragging .
he also wants us to know he can take massive risks
and still get away with it .
it &apos;s probably why he took strauss into a crowd of people .
that and to humiliate her publicly .
but he called hotch from her phone .
it was important to him that we find her alive .
the director wants this contained and solved .
well , at least he &apos;s not taking us off the case .
he &apos;s given us 24 hours and then he will .
i &apos;m taking her back to bethesda .
she never liked this city , aaron .
i &apos;m not about to leave her .
could you give us a minute , please .
is jack staying here ?
i think it &apos;s a good idea .
you &apos;re lucky to have beth .
i know .
her children want to meet me at bethesda .
how old are they now ?
too young for this .
you all right ?
she smells of booze , aaron .
you and i know it &apos;s because that bastard took away her dignity .
but her children might not believe that .
it &apos;s hard for them to trust
anything to do with her drinking .
she struggled with it all her life .
and she was finally beating it .
he knew about foyet ?
who &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s the man who killed my wife .
that &apos;s a classified case and it &apos;s not in any database .
then how would he know about it ?
if he had access to the file ,
we &apos;re talking about someone on the inside .
conference room in 5 .
garcia , is this everything ?
yeah . the replicator stuff is here ,
and the team stuff is there and there .
how &apos;s rossi ?
not good .
yeah . is he with strauss ?
yeah .
ok . uh--uh , i started with the question you asked--
why attack strauss and on this day ?
the most obvious answer is that it &apos;s an anniversary of some sort .
but there &apos;s nothing historically relevant .
it could be the smallest thing .
concentrate on new york . if the date &apos;s that important ,
the setting could be , too .
it would be easier to attack strauss at home .
is there a reason why he waited for her to be out ?
well , considering she &apos;s hardly ever in the field ,
he sure got a lot of photos of strauss .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s obsessed with her .
maybe strauss was always his first target .
he attacked the top of the bau chain first .
all right , reid , you &apos;ve matched up
all the murder locations with the dates .
now we need to know how long it would take
to drive to each of these locations ,
assuming a home base in the district .
he brought the fight here for a reason .
well , it &apos;s nearly impossible to figure out
when he arrived and departed new york , but we should try .
i &apos;ll collect all the public and private transport stuff .
garcia , i need kevin to go through
every single pixel of these photographs .
this unsub gets off on taunting us .
he &apos;s given us answers here . we just haven &apos;t found them yet .
are you all right ?
yeah .
she was a good woman .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
are those her children out there ?
her ex is on the way .
you know the family well .
it feels like i do .
through her .
so , uh , when will we get the tox results ?
we have them .
it &apos;s what you expected . meth and ecstasy combo .
though it didn &apos;t cause the internal boiling
like with the new york victims .
a lower dose , or did he alter it ?
we won &apos;t know until we get the exact breakdown .
i &apos;ll let you know the second i hear .
so what do you make of the markings on her wrist ?
torture , right ? it was done antemortem .
what ?
the carving i showed you .
right .
sorry . can you show me that again ?
dave , a figure 8 ?
that &apos;s what it looks like .
i just sent you all a picture .
maybe it &apos;s an infinity symbol .
well , if it &apos;s infinity ,
he could be boasting &quot; i &apos;ll go on forever &quot; ?
or if it &apos;s an 8,
strauss was his eighth victim .
and the unofficial eighth member of our team .
if this is a taunt from him , it &apos;s too random .
well , he &apos;s only sent one message
and he seems to be real proud of it .
zugzwang .
then what does this mean ?
rossi , the cut looks jagged .
any idea what caused the serration ?
best guess is a piece of glass .
maybe he used empty bottles from the mini bar ?
those were all plastic .
the m.e. is checking for splinters now .
all right , let us know what you find out .
anything from the photographs yet ?
we blew up a few more and this one seems to stand out .
when were you in a tuxedo ?
it was a british embassy event .
security clearance is high .
security was insane there .
that kind of accessibility , plus knowing about foyet ,
the fact that he was able to
get through all of my security clearances alone ,
you guys are right . you have to trust your gut .
the replicator has gotta be on the inside .
the director needs to know the status of the system failure .
give me another few hours .
he &apos;s not happy about it .
yeah , well , who is ?
if the replicator &apos;s an insider ,
is there any way strauss knew him ?
she said she didn &apos;t recognize him .
to her defense , she was disoriented by the drug overdose .
she was adamant about it .
well , even if strauss didn &apos;t know him ,
it doesn &apos;t mean he didn &apos;t know her .
within the bureau , she is the face of the bau .
and clearly a target from the beginning .
but why ?
more importantly , what was he replicating ?
the drug overdose .
i mean with the 8 .
it hasn &apos;t been part of any other case ,
and he &apos;s not one to make mistakes .
he thought he was replicating a crime .
the director made us walk away from the case a few months ago .
strauss said that she wouldn &apos;t let it go .
what if she hadn &apos;t ?
you think she started her own investigation ?
well , if she thought he was an insider ,
she might have done something to trap him .
why wouldn &apos;t she have told you about that back in new york ?
maybe she didn &apos;t have proof .
but her determination ,
plus the fact that he doesn &apos;t make mistakes
makes me think that the 8 was part of her plan to catch him .
do we have her laptop ?
all the hacking in the world isn &apos;t gonna help if they shut us down .
he can &apos;t win , not like this .
this is strauss &apos; laptop .
i need to access who was on the distribution list
for my case reports .
you don &apos;t know who reads your reports ?
i know she sent them to the head of the criminal division
and the director , but i don &apos;t know who else is on the list .
the last case she sent in was the case in detroit .
the cutter .
she amended the report and said that the unsub
cut a figure 8 into his victims &apos; wrists .
but he didn &apos;t do that .
no , he didn &apos;t .
so she duped him . which means that one of the people
reading these reports has gotta be the replicator .
it doesn &apos;t show who else saw this .
two other people read the report .
who ?
you &apos;re gonna need a tie .
agent hotchner , i have a very full day .
yes , sir , we all do .
senator , can i suggest that we move this into your office .
there &apos;s nothing you could tell me
that these walls have not heard before .
how long has the department of justice been watching the bau ?
that &apos;s no secret .
we made it clear to your director
and your section chief that we were watching your team closely
ever since that ordeal with agent ...
prentiss .
yes .
she &apos;s running an office in london and that &apos;s a good place for her .
you receive my case files from the director .
well , agent , that &apos;s classified .
sir , it &apos;s not a question . i know you &apos;re on the list .
i need to know who else has access to them .
i &apos;m not answering that until i get some insight
as to what this is all about .
there &apos;s a man that &apos;s been replicating
many of the crimes that we &apos;ve solved in the last year .
erin strauss told us all about it .
he killed her last night , sir , in new york . she was murdered .
what ?
why haven &apos;t i been told about this ?
the director &apos;s keeping this contained .
we believe that this unsub is targeting the rest of us ,
and we &apos;ve determined that he &apos;s someone
within the highest levels of the justice system
and he &apos;s been reading the details of my reports .
i need the names , sir .
at least this narrows it down .
finding someone on the inside should be easier .
not necessarily . if our unsub was trained by law enforcement ,
he &apos;d know how to fit in perfectly .
there &apos;s meaning and purpose to everything he does .
why did he choose to replicate the silencer case ?
well , that unsub went dormant for years &apos; cause he was locked up .
is that a clue about the replicator ?
well , it speaks to his patience .
what about his m.o. ? he sewed mouths shut .
it symbolizes keeping secrets .
there could be something in that .
he &apos;s targeting everyone .
so how does that particular case factor into all of us ?
it &apos;s the first one garcia and i worked on with blake .
yeah , but the rest of us worked on the seattle case before that .
right . the unsub who used his kid to bait the victims .
we need to see if he replicated that one .
the system is still down , thanks to yours truly ,
which i &apos;m horrified about .
i &apos;m trying to get the deets on the seattle case
this way now , literally .
you and i were in london when the other guys spent time in seattle .
i &apos;m on the phone right now with jennie from vicap
to see if that particular m.o. has ever been duplicated .
yeah , i &apos;m still here .
uh , it would be seattle , early september .
right .
no , not email . can you fax it ?
fax , yeah .
thank you .
i take that as a yes .
before he copied the silencer case ,
he was in seattle weeks after they solved the sadist .
go check the fax machine . she just sent you that replicated case .
thanks , baby girl .
yeah . yeah .
ok . i did something right .
i need everybody in the conference room .
a dozen federal employees
have read our case files over the last two years .
they all went through the highest levels of security .
each of those names needs to be checked against reid &apos;s list .
we should get them all in here and start the interrogations .
if he knows we &apos;re looking his way , he might retreat .
we should also check the support staffs of all those employees .
each one has two assistants , so we &apos;re already up to 36 people .
we should start with agents who work a 4 @-@ day , 40 @-@ hour week ,
given the fact that most of the murders
happened over a long weekend ,
which means if the unsub traveled by car ,
no one at work would &apos;ve missed them .
well , he probably wouldn &apos;t fly .
it would leave a paper trail .
what &apos;s this ?
the replicator &apos;s first case was the same as mine .
remember the sadist who made ridgeway look tame ?
in seattle , so it wasn &apos;t the silencer .
do you think it &apos;s a coincidence
he started all of this when i joined the team ?
i don &apos;t know .
dave &apos;s back ?
excuse me .
he &apos;s only been back a few minutes .
it looks like it &apos;s hitting him pretty hard .
well , they were together for the last year .
that &apos;s the director . i &apos;ll be right back .
yes , sir . this is agent hotchner .
hey , rossi .
you all right ?
you don &apos;t look so good .
get out .
look , i know this has gotta be tough on you--
rossi , what the hell are you doing ?
rossi , put the gun down .
rossi .
what &apos;s going on ?
morgan &apos;s dna was on the glass that cut her wrist .
strauss ?
you did that .
no , i didn &apos;t .
dave , someone on the inside is doing this .
you &apos;re looking at him .
derek did not hurt her , and you have to trust me on this .
trust you ? i bet you told erin the same thing .
look what that got her .
dave , you &apos;ve been drugged .
i was too late , erin .
i &apos;m so sorry .
he wants us against each other .
if you pull that trigger , he wins .
she &apos;s not there .
give me the gun .
i &apos;m gonna call the paramedics .
sit down . it &apos;s all right .
they &apos;ve given him a sedative
and they &apos;re going to take him to the infirmary .
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
how did it get into his system ?
the report must have been dusted with whatever he used on strauss .
luckily the transdermal absorption rate
was lower than her ingestion of it ,
so it wasn &apos;t fatal for rossi .
then this was a warning .
if he wanted to kill rossi , he had every chance to do it .
if this is his endgame ,
why is he wasting time with warnings ?
he &apos;s toying with us and we &apos;re playing into him .
he &apos;s turned rossi against morgan .
even if it was temporary , he wanted to show it could be done .
but why ?
strauss was dosed with a chemical cousin of doctor death .
he altered it so her torture would be longer .
a biochemist , computer hacker , and federal agent ?
who the hell is this guy ?
only half the cameras are working
because the system is still rebooting itself ,
so the security guards have to go old school .
that means everyone has to sign in .
you can &apos;t take your i.d. and run it through--
well , you know what old school means .
so , if you have a badge , you don &apos;t get harassed .
the man who signed in to see rossi
went up to the sixth floor ,
held the door open for kevin and anderson ...
i can &apos;t believe he was right there .
walked through our bau into rossi &apos;s office ,
signed in as adam worth .
adam worth ?
isn &apos;t that the same alias he used when maeve went missing ?
yeah , which means it &apos;s not just a taunt .
it speaks directly to his psychology .
adam worth was a famous criminal from the late 1800s ,
commonly referred to as the napoleon of crime .
this unsub obviously sees himself in the same light .
so this guy is a malignant narcissist
who wants to be known as the worst enemy we &apos;ve ever had .
and look , he &apos;s careful to hide his face from the cameras .
because he knows exactly where they are .
the replicator has directly taunted everyone on this team
except for me .
you may be part of his endgame .
then so was strauss .
he chose to use drugs as his final replication .
that &apos;s no accident .
is that a connection to you ?
strauss and i had issues during the amerithrax case .
it started in new york with poison .
and it was delivered by envelopes .
why would anyone on the inside hold resentment over that case ?
because that person suffered a professional setback
just like blake ,
but was patient and psychotic enough to get revenge .
i am all over the doj names including support staff .
i have kevin pulling files and photos .
system is down , so it &apos;s hard to check entire career paths ,
but there were two agents in new york in 2001 .
scratch that-- lehman died in october--
that leaves curtis .
wait a second ? john curtis ?
you know him ?
i haven &apos;t seen him in a long time .
he was a nice guy .
we were first office agents together ,
but i thought he left the bureau after the amerithrax case .
could it be him ? does he fit the profile ?
he was quiet and a loner , but brilliant .
he specialized in a lot of fields ,
but his passion
was biochemistry .
he inherited a family compound in rural virginia .
coordinates on on your phone .
what else do you have on curtis ?
just like you thought . john curtis was demoted in the fbi
after the amerithrax case .
he was slated to take over the coveted new york field office ,
but then was shipped to the not coveted kansas city one .
he worked there for many years quietly
before he was able to weasel his way back into the nation &apos;s capital .
on paper he is a rock star .
he immediately transferred to the department of justice ,
the intelligence oversight section .
he &apos;s a genius on multiple levels .
what &apos;s his background ?
only child , parents died when he was 18 .
never married . total loner , just like blake said .
then all he &apos;s ever had to care about is his work .
and when he lost that , he snapped .
hrt will divide us up when we land .
as you can see rom the geo ref he &apos;s got plenty of privacy .
5.1 / 2 acres , 3 structures , house included .
garcia .
i see it , too , sir .
it must be some sort of system override .
what &apos;s happening ?
autopilot &apos;s seized .
oh , god .
mayday .
i got it back .
are you ok ?
we &apos;re stabilizing .
brace for impact .
mayday , mayday , mayday !
mayday , mayday , mayday !
i can &apos;t get through to any of them .
we have agents in those choppers .
it was only one . the first is circling back now .
are they ok ?
copy .
ok , as a precaution , they separated
to land on opposite sides of the property ,
and the controls were taken over by a remote override .
which can only happen within a 5 @-@ mile radius .
he knew they were coming .
and how they were getting there .
are you guys all right ?
yeah .
where &apos;s blake ?
what the hell is this ?
what is this ?
we &apos;re back in business .
thank you .
sir .
where is everybody ?
right this second , in a field .
if he &apos;d wanted to kill all of us , he could have .
he &apos;s playing god , just like he &apos;s done all year .
he hard @-@ landed us , knocked us out
with whatever was in those canister so he could take blake .
he had plenty of chances to take her before tonight .
he wants it to be a spectacle .
what do you want ?
you &apos;re the profiler .
you tell me .
you don &apos;t want to know .
reverse psychology .
i &apos;m not going to beg for your analysis .
you don &apos;t have to beg .
i already know how desperate you are for it .
i didn &apos;t remember you being so skittish .
you &apos;ve never seen me in chains before ?
i &apos;ve seen you with your hands tied , so to speak .
erin strauss and the bureau discarded us .
we were the forgotten ones .
they forgot you .
i did all right .
but they &apos;ll remember me now .
you know , i admired you back then ,
leading the charge on the day it all changed ,
the day erin strauss ruined us .
i sat next to you .
borrowed your pen to sign my transfer .
they put me in kansas .
me .
you know what i &apos;ve been wondering ?
why did strauss change her mind about you ?
i kept my head down and i worked hard .
we all did .
but you got my chance .
we &apos;re ready to breach the house .
which way did he go ?
i don &apos;t know .
morgan , you and jj find him . we &apos;ve got this .
he said he used 8 locks
because there used to be 8 of us .
that &apos;s all he said ?
about that , yes .
there &apos;s only 6 keys . that mean two keys will be used twice .
each key is a letter ,
likely corresponds to a number on the locks .
7--seventh letter of the alphabet &apos;s &quot; g. &quot;
what are the other letters ?
um , z , u , w--
zugzwang .
it &apos;s too easy .
morgan ?
he &apos;s got the place lined with c @-@ 4 .
we &apos;ve only got 3 minutes .
this seems too easy .
zugzwang also means a dilemma in chess
where the best move is not to move at all .
wait , don &apos;t get up !
it &apos;s a pressure sensor .
they &apos;ve gotta hurry .
sir , i can &apos;t block this thing off for long .
drop the gun .
you &apos;d really die for them ?
that &apos;s the oath we all took .
to protect our country from people like you ,
no matter what .
you never appreciated me , none of you .
i gave you my life , and you rejected me .
you can tell me your sob story while walking .
everybody get back ! there &apos;s c @-@ 4 in the basement .
everybody back !
wait , where &apos;s rossi ?
he was right behind me .
dave !
he just let us out . why would he go back in ?
we &apos;ll go out as heroes .
i &apos;m not so sure about that .
zugzwang .
it had to be a perfect round .
and sure enough , coming right back at me was the target .
and it was blasted right through the chest .
the goggles come off ...
and it &apos;s strauss .
i mean , i was like , what ?
i would have never believed
it if i hadn &apos;t seen it with my own eyes .
that woman ...
she was one hell of a shot .
um ... do you guys remember that one time
that she called me , but i thought that it was somebody else ?
oh , no .
that was funny .
oh , maybe to you . i was mortified .
what did you say ?
i said , &quot; talk dirty to me . &quot;
yes , she did .
that &apos;s my girl .
are you kidding ?
hey , that was my line .
whatever are you doing here ?
last year , right here ,
we had a ...
very different celebration .
of life ,
of love ,
and good people .
this year it &apos;s the , uh , other side of that .
because , well ...
that &apos;s what families do .
it &apos;s been a hard year .
but tonight ...
we celebrate a life well lived ...
well loved ...
to a good woman ...
an even better mother ...
to our friend ...
who i will miss very much .
