nice effort .
everybody knows i went to rehab .
they don &apos;t know that you were my dealer .
you &apos;re selling my pills ?
where &apos;d you get the drugs ?
it was me . i did it .
you could have gotten me arrested for shoplifting .
mariana , you &apos;re a genius .
she ran away because i kissed her .
we feel she deserves a second chance ,
but we are not prepared to bring her
back into our home at this time .
she &apos;s gonna think you &apos;re giving up on her !
i ran away , i don &apos;t belong here .
you know me , right ?
wanna take another crack at my face ?
i need to see my little brother . he needs to know why i left .
you don &apos;t get to just act
out and then run away from the consequences .
not in this house .
in fact , not anywhere in life .
with all the strings we
pulled to get callie into that group home ,
you didn &apos;t think maybe you
should &apos;ve told me she was involved with your son ?
we spoke to brandon , and we thought we had this under control .
if you want callie &apos;s program to work for her ,
she can &apos;t be dealing with this stuff .
if brandon shows up again , callie &apos;s out .
we agree with you , 100 percent . that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
i just hope he takes you seriously this time .
thank you . so do we .
morning .
morning , judeicorn .
what ?
judeicorn ? really ?
are you hungry ? i can make you something .
waffles ? french toast ?
who is that ? is that a social worker ?
no . it &apos;s , um ... i think it &apos;s callie &apos;s probation officer .
but i &apos;m sure everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
apparently , we have some sort of misunderstanding .
just because there are no locks on the doors or bars on the windows ,
that doesn &apos;t mean you can
run out of the house whenever you please
just to go see your boyfriend .
he &apos;s not my ...
well , whoever he is , zero contact .
you have anything to say ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
is that a question ?
it won &apos;t happen again .
good .
and there &apos;ll be no more accidents with cole , or with anyone else .
i have really had it , callie . no more passes .
mm @-@ hm .
look at me .
you got it ?
got it .
good . you can go .
dad .
come here .
callie &apos;s probation officer just left .
listen , i just wanted to make sure callie was ok ,
just see for myself .
after we expressly forbid it ?
we have the right to see each other .
no , you don &apos;t have the right to interfere with her probation .
well , you can &apos;t stop us .
actually , we can .
what &apos;s this ?
a restraining order , brandon .
if you go within 100 feet of callie again , you &apos;ll be arrested .
this is such bull !
brandon ,
we know that you care about callie ,
and that given the choice you might feel obligated to see her .
this restraining order , it takes it off the table .
b , we &apos;re just trying to protect you both .
whatever .
it &apos;s completely insane .
well , that went about as well as expected , huh ?
this , i mean ... are we doing the right thing ?
we can &apos;t have a 24 @-@ hour tail on him .
once he calms down and gets over himself ,
he &apos;ll realize this is what &apos;s best for callie .
i gotta go .
first day back , already ? how you feeling ?
honestly ? a little guilty . you should be coming with me .
don &apos;t feel bad . i &apos;m fine . this is all gonna work itself out .
ok ? besides , you don &apos;t want
me to go back before i finish the engine , do you ?
he has a point .
mike , thank you for working on my car and for ,
you know , just being here .
if there &apos;s anything you need ...
just coffee .
i &apos;ll get it myself .
brandon will get over it .
i &apos;m just worried about callie .
how do we know she &apos;s not
sitting there thinking brandon is the only one
who hasn &apos;t given up on her ?
it &apos;s just hard .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s called tough love .
yeah ?
well , i forgot how tough you looked in uniform .
you see ?
call me at lunch ,
let me know how things are going ?
absolutely . i love you .
love you .
this is such crap .
hey , you &apos;re lucky hosing off
cans is all you got for running out of the house
to get a little somethin &apos; somethin &apos; from your boy .
all i got was a hug .
uh @-@ huh .
look , hurry it up .
the van &apos;s picking us up in ten for the field trip .
uh , i lost my privileges .
it ain &apos;t a privilege .

the movie at the planetarium . it opens in a couple weeks .

i &apos;m either working or avoiding your call .
so good luck .
hey , it &apos;s me , i was just checking in .
um , my lunch is almost over and i have a meeting ,
but ... call if you get this in the next few minutes . ok ?
i love you . bye .
sorry . um , the kindle paperwhite e @-@ readers are here .
oh , wow ! oh , my goodness .
it must be nice to be a student these days .
right ?
thank god for grants .
wow , it &apos;s so light .
and the cool thing is ,
now the kids can read their assignments , add margin notes ,
and export them to their computers .
wow . fancy .

they &apos;re for the children .
i was just kidding .
you ok ?
yeah . it &apos;s , um ...
stef &apos;s first day back to work .
yeah . but i &apos;m fine .
i stood up in front of all our friends and family and ...
i said i would be fine , so yeah .
i &apos;m ok .
ok .
it keeps sticking .
what do you expect ? it &apos;s , like , a thousand years old .
great , now i have to hand sew everything .
goodbye , sleep .
i &apos;ll fix it .
probably not today , but ...
you &apos;re a tech wizard , you can &apos;t just make it work ?
yeah , i &apos;ll get right on top of that , rose .
ok , you did not just say that . you know that movie ?
don &apos;t tell mom the babysitter &apos;s dead ?
it &apos;s a classic .
i love old movies !
lexi and i watched it like a million times .
when we were little , we used to
think that watching pg @-@ 13 movies was so dangerous .
we were such dorks .
my favorite part is the grunion run .
i know , right ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to do that .
me too . it &apos;s so cool .
here . rejects .
ok ... what &apos;s wrong ?
uh ... i gotta go .
you even have to ask ?
obviously .
you knew i liked chase .
what ?
running lines ?
everybody knows that &apos;s code for hooking up .
it is ?
god , are you even listening ?
what ? chase asked me . i wasn &apos;t going after him .
i was just doing my job , alone , thanks to you .
oh , so forget me , right ?
just like when i covered
for your ass when you were dealing drugs ,
and then you dumped me as a thank you ?
i thought you were sorry about all that .
a fly orchid &apos;s petals look like flies ,
and it actually mimics pheromones ,
which attract hordes of male insects .
an insect will land on the flower and try to mate with it ,
with , of course , no success .
the system by which we call this is sexual deception .
sounds like a date with gabi .
i don &apos;t need to trick anybody .
ok , we &apos;re out of the house , can we act like we have some sense ?
at least i don &apos;t need to beg for it .
ok , enough .
please , can we get another line of jokes ?
gabi , you take this up to you .
you think that &apos;s a joke ? to make a sexual innuendo is not a joke .

god , brandon , you can &apos;t be here . what if you get arrested ?
so , what , you &apos;re the only one who can take risks ?

we have to be smart about this .
callie !
excuse me . sorry , excuse me .
sorry .
crap .
i just want to help . ok ?
do you need anything ?
yeah , to get out of that house .
what about getting emancipated ? kids do that , right ?
yeah , if i had a million dollars for a lawyer .
you should go . someone &apos;s gonna notice you &apos;re gone .
wait , um ...
how &apos;s jude ?
he &apos;s ok .
he hates me , doesn &apos;t he ?

you wanna get bounced back to juvie ?
hey , where have you been ?
um , sorry , i ...
got lost looking for the bathrooms .
you know you &apos;re not supposed to separate from the group .
yeah , i know , it &apos;s my fault .
i just didn &apos;t want to interrupt the tour .
sorry . it won &apos;t happen again .
yeah . it won &apos;t . let &apos;s go .
now we &apos;re straight .
so are you just gonna ignore me for the rest of the day ?
maybe .
look , i &apos;m sorry about chase .
seriously , if i thought it was gonna cause all this drama ,
i never would &apos;ve agreed to run lines with him .
you mean it ?
yeah .
i mean , i won &apos;t do it if it really bothers you .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m totally sorry too .
we &apos;re just becoming friends again ,
and we &apos;re letting a boy come between us ?
hells , no . we are not those girls .
hey , chase .
um , one sec .
hey , chase ?
hey .
i &apos;m so sorry , but , um ,
with all the alterations and stuff , i &apos;m sorta swamped , so ...
... i can &apos;t run lines with you after school .
well , that kinda sucks .
but i &apos;m free . i &apos;d love to run lines with you .
cool .
excuse me , this is the line for the boy &apos;s bathroom .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry , but you can &apos;t sneak in because it &apos;s shorter .
it &apos;s confusing to the younger students .
you &apos;re the only one confused here . mind your business .
cole , just get over here .
is there a problem ?
she &apos;s in the wrong line , that &apos;s all i was telling her , and she ...
why can &apos;t you understand that
using the other bathroom is confusing for me ?
if you don &apos;t calm down , we &apos;ll escort you ...
state law says i have the right to use any public bathroom i want .
and this is a public museum !
that &apos;s enough .
don &apos;t put hands on me !
stay in your lane , freak !
what did you call me ? !
what did you say ? !
i said , back off !
don &apos;t touch her !
stop , get off ! back away .
get off her , come on !
walk away , girls ! you walk away !
social services will transport you to juvenile hall ,
and there you will be ...

what are we gonna do with you ?
we will have the report sent to his po .
thanks .
come on , let &apos;s go .
easy , easy , easy .
ok . let &apos;s go .
four times .
it seems like a waste to send him back to juvie .
yeah , once they &apos;re in the system , lost cause .
and the older you get them ,
the harder it is to straighten them out .
i don &apos;t know about that .
not if someone fights for them .
all these kids really want to know is that somebody loves them .
the problem is nobody does .
as we continue this semester &apos;s analysis of the great gatsby ,
we dive into ...
what the hell was that ?
we said we weren &apos;t going to let a boy come between us .
we aren &apos;t .
i thought that meant neither of us was going after chase .
sorry , what do you want me to do ?
nothing . it &apos;s fine .
uh @-@ uh ! not so fast .
your homework is to write 1,000 words answering this question :
does gatsby love daisy ,

i &apos;m sorry for that , too .
mariana &apos;s birthday , and some stupid audition ?

brandon ...
how about when i was six ,
and you nearly drove off the road , drunk , with me in the car ?
or after the divorce , you want on that bender ,
i didn &apos;t see you for a month .
brandon , i never drank around you when you were little .
oh , right , yeah , so i &apos;m making that up .
no , i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re making it up , ok ?
i just don &apos;t remember .
yeah , you can &apos;t remember .
that &apos;s the thing about being a drunk :
you get to forget what the rest of us can &apos;t .
um , i got the pedal working .

nope , i &apos;ve got everything i need .
hey . um ... where &apos;s kelsey ?
uh , yeah , turns out she couldn &apos;t make it after all .
but i still have a few days to finish the costumes , so ...
i mean , if you &apos;re still interested .
what &apos;s this for ?
you really gave vico a run for his money .
i figured you deserved a cookie .
like a dog ?
it &apos;s organic , jerk , no dyes .
i &apos;m giving you props , you held your own .
yeah , for about three seconds .
you &apos;ve gotta learn to accept praise .
so ... do you want to run with me tomorrow ?
whoa , i &apos;ve got a girlfriend .
and a giant ego .
hey , newbie , time for your tunnel of love !
he &apos;s talking to you .

i guess we got a little outta hand with that .
tell you what , i &apos;ll talk to the guys , ok ?
i don &apos;t know what you think we &apos;re running here ,
but this is not fight club .
this is a school . we &apos;re not turning a blind eye !
so this rite of passage , it ends now , or your job does .
are we clear ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
&quot; i could put on an act for you , laura , &quot;
&quot; and say lots of things without being very sincere .
&quot; but i don &apos;t ... &quot;
&quot; i ... &quot;
damn , i always screw this part up . line ?
&quot; um , but this time , i am . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m talking to you sincerely . &quot;
&quot; um , but this time , i am . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m talking to you sincerely . &quot;
&quot; i happened to notice you had this inferiority complex &quot;
&quot; that keeps you from feeling comfortable with people . &quot;
&quot; someone needs to build your confidence up &quot;
&quot; and make you proud &quot;
&quot; instead of shy and turning away and blushing . &quot;
&quot; someone ought to ... &quot;
... &quot; ought to kiss you , laura . &quot;
everytime you ...
i don &apos;t want to have your issue all over for me .
stop tripping ! you need to get over yourself , cole !
why can &apos;t you just do what you &apos;re supposed to do ?
we only got a few hours of freedom .
you know , we had to leave early because of your ass .
i have rights .
we looked that law up , cole . it only applies in schools .
it was a field trip during school hours , i should have the right !
but you don &apos;t , so until you do , stop throwing your &quot; trantrums . &quot;
hey , gabi , can you express yourself to cole calmly ?
i think cole makes things hard on herself .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i think you &apos;re an angry person , and i think the only thing
that &apos;s going to change when you go through your little transition
is that you &apos;re going to be an angry person with a penis !
gabi .
at least i know who i am .
girl , please .
don &apos;t call me &quot; girl &quot; !
everybody should know by now ,
refer to cole as &quot; he . &quot; all right ?
callie , you haven &apos;t said anything .
i think cole &apos;s right .
what ?
yeah . you just want him to do what &apos;s easy for you ,
but sometimes what &apos;s right isn &apos;t easy .
what are you , jesus christ ?
no , for real .
no , i &apos;m serious .
you say you think cole makes things hard on himself ,
but what you actually mean is he makes things hard on you .
so maybe you should stop thinking about yourself all the time ,
and cut cole a little slack .
i think that was very well said , callie .
whatever , i &apos;m over it .
yeah , seriously .
what &apos;s his problem ?
he got a little roughed up at practice ,
and i had to have a talk with his coach .
in front of everyone !
mom .
we can &apos;t have students pummeling each other .
you &apos;re not just the vice principal , you know ,
it &apos;s not that easy hearing
people call you &quot; meana lena &quot; all the time .

right there .
can i help you ?
hi . are you rita ?
yes .
hi , i &apos;m stef foster .
callie jacob &apos;s foster mom , one of them . i , um ...
i spoke to you on the phone .

i was driving home from work and i thought i &apos;d stop in ,
you know , see how she &apos;s doing .
she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s good ?
yeah .
that &apos;s good .
i , um ... i don &apos;t suppose
there &apos;s any chance i could just say hi to her ?
stef ?
uh @-@ huh ?
yeah . um , callie actually doesn &apos;t have her privileges ,
but even if she did , you can &apos;t just show up unannounced .
i just , uh ...
last time we saw her was in the courtroom and it ...
uh ... i just don &apos;t want her to think that we don &apos;t care .
yeah , i don &apos;t think she thinks that .
and if you don &apos;t mind a little advice , let her come to you .
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;s in good hands .
good , thank you .

we have a stocked pantry ,
and you can help yourself anytime you want .
are you worried that we &apos;re going to run out ?
no . it &apos;s just ,
sometimes foster homes don &apos;t have a lot of food .
or they , you know , they keep track of what we eat .
are you afraid someone &apos;s going to come and take you from us ?
that &apos;s kinda how it goes .
callie does something , case workers show up , we get moved .
oh , my goodness .
i know how scary it is ,
feeling like the rug could be pulled out from under you
at any minute .
you do ?
sure , i do .
i felt that way when i got the call that stef had been shot ,
and i imagine it felt the same way for you when callie ran away .
jude , i can &apos;t promise you that there won &apos;t be any surprises .
life is unpredictable .
but you can &apos;t live your life in fear of what might happen .
the one thing that i know for sure
is that you are safe in this house ,
and we won &apos;t pull the rug out from under you .
it &apos;s ok .

kelsey ? kelsey who you &apos;re not supposed to be hanging out with kelsey ?

because you are done . no more extracurricular activities .

but it &apos;s for the best .

to be kept from the person you want to see every day .
