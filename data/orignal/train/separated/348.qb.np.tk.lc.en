come on !
i can &apos;t believe you did that .
i got us free shots , didn &apos;t i ?
michelle , everyone was taking pictures .
they better tag us , then .
that &apos;s the last thing i want . what if adam saw ?
he &apos;s at a bachelor party in vegas .
if they only wake up with a tiger in their bathroom ,
they &apos;ve failed at life .
what happened ? i thought the girls were right behind us .
i think amber lee had to close out .
you want me to go get them ?
yeah , right . i &apos;ll never see you again .
you wait here . i &apos;ll go get them .
fine . have another drink while you &apos;re at it .
next stop is the pole vault ,
and they have a strict &quot; no prudes &quot; policy .
and get us some wine .
hey there , cowboy .
you got a light ?
slow down , stetson .
my friends are probably looking for me .
i can &apos;t help it . you &apos;re so beautiful .
houston , i think we have a problem .
must &apos;ve had too much to drink .
of course you did .
get off of me .
hey . come on , just give me a damn second .
uh ... no .
no . it &apos;s not working .
we &apos;re through .
i &apos;ll say when we &apos;re through .
the theory of variation .
time to prove who did the reading .
susan .
it focuses on the universal
properties common to a given language .
you &apos;re quoting the text . give me an example .
french .
uh , spoken worldwide , but the same phrase in paris
might have a completely different inference in montreal .
that &apos;s right . this theory looks at the cultural stages
a particular language undergoes
in order to understand its evolution .
who can tell me the first stage ?
anton .
pidgin .
pidgin is correct , mr. slavsky .
this is when non @-@ native speakers use phrases
from the mainstream language in a broken manner ,
often resulting in an overly literal ...
translation of the meaning .
i thought cell phones weren &apos;t allowed in class , dr. blake .
it would appear that i &apos;m a variation
to my own rule .
jeffrey .
last night michelle bradley
went missing from a friend &apos;s bachelorette party
in austin , texas .
austin p.d. say that she is the third
in a series of abductions in a week .
right . the first victim , craig pickett ,
he was a student at t.u.
he disappeared from a fraternity party .
he was discovered at the visitor parking lot just after sunrise .
he had been beaten with a blunt object .
and then heather wilson , she was a veterinarian
living in the old west district .
she disappeared from a speed @-@ dating function thing
and she was found in a nearby alley the next morning .
she had been stripped and she had been stabbed .
each of the victims was at a
social gathering the night that they were abducted .
witness reports say that
they were there one minute and gone the next .
ok , so this guy doesn &apos;t waste any time .
he knows who he wants and how to get them .
that shows organization and sophistication .
he had craig and heather
for less than 12 hours before he killed them .
we may already be out of time to save michelle .
no apparent link in victimology .
what troubles me is the variation in m.o.
the speed and efficiency of the abduction suggests one unsub .
so is he using weapons of opportunity
or specifically catering his murder ritual to each victim ?
there &apos;s clear evidence of overkill on both .
craig &apos;s face was caved in ,
and the damage to heather &apos;s genitals was extensive .
he &apos;s angry , but about what ?
well , the motive on heather appears sexual .
she was stripped down to nothing more than a watch ,
while craig was left fully clothed .
his wallet was missing .
there might be some kind of financial motivation .
or it &apos;s plain old @-@ fashioned jealousy .
he kills craig in a rage and the beast is unleashed .
that &apos;s when he starts targeting women .
his area of control appears to be quite large .
what &apos;s interesting is he dumps the bodies
in the same district they &apos;re abducted from .
so he doesn &apos;t go far , yet he &apos;d need privacy .
maybe he uses his vehicle for the assaults .
which means he could be anywhere .
&quot; the world breaks everyone ,
and afterward , many are stronger at the broken places . &quot;
ernest hemingway .
gentlemen .
detective sanchez .
agent morgan .
agent rossi .
appreciate the help .
i haven &apos;t seen anything like this before .
consider yourself fortunate .
she was stabbed ?
it &apos;s a lot of blood .
it looks like michelle was still bleeding out
when the unsub dumped her here .
he was probably with her the whole night .
a large pickup truck or an suv would go unnoticed
in these parts .
give him room to work .
a bachelorette party and a speed @-@ dating function .
both female victims were in situations
that would have drawn the attention of the men around them .
so maybe the unsub was on the prowl .
the women could have enraged him
by rejecting his advances .
well , they didn &apos;t reject him right away , though .
he was able to lure both into isolation ,
which tells me he &apos;s got game .
well , what about craig pickett ?
he disappeared from a frat party .
well , pickett was the first victim .
and the unsub &apos;s use of a blunt object rather than a knife
suggests that the kill was impulsive .
it &apos;s probable that craig and the unsub are connected .
you should take a closer look
at his classmates and professors .
excuse me for a minute .
what &apos;s up ?
michelle bradley &apos;s crime scene photos just came in .
take a look .
he took off everything but the watch ,
just like with heather wilson .
no clothes , no earrings ,
not so much as a hair tie left .
but he leaves a watch .
it &apos;s a compulsion .
it could be his signature .
shanice , do you happen to remember
if michelle was wearing this watch last night ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i don &apos;t know .
do you happen to have any pictures on your phone
i could take a look at ?
oh ... yeah , we took a couple .
here you go .
thank you .
i counted 40 stab wounds of various depths of penetration .
he &apos;s targeting her femininity .
this type of anger stems from a deep @-@ seated hatred of women .
or a woman .
so you think they &apos;re surrogates
for someone who emasculated him ?
the time and effort it takes to stab someone 40 times
takes determination ,
the sort indicative of someone affected by a past trauma .
well , if his work here is any indication ,
he &apos;s unraveling quickly .
we should take a look at craig .
he triggered the unsub &apos;s violence .
he certainly put up the biggest fight . here .
let me show you .
craig was harder to control .
how did he get the bruising on his chest and back ?
he was fully clothed when he was found .
there &apos;s no tears in his shirt .
he must not have been wearing it when he was attacked .
the unsub dressed him postmortem .
he &apos;s showing remorse .
craig was closer to his attacker than we thought .
how long have you and craig been roommates ?
since freshman year .
you two seem very close .
he was like my brother .
well , that &apos;s rare .
my freshman roommate and i didn &apos;t get along . at all .
you told police you went to the game
the night after craig disappeared ?
what happened after that ?
uh , came back to the campus .
hit a couple of frat parties .
which ones ?
uh--uh--i don &apos;t really remember .
i was drunk .
this must be tough ,
having to pack up all his things on your own .
didn &apos;t his family want to help ?
well , we &apos;ve been living together a long time .
i told them i &apos;d sort through what was his and what was mine .
yeah . that reminds me
of another roommate i had at the academy .
she used to make me promise her
that if something ever happened to her ,
i &apos;d get rid of anything her parents shouldn &apos;t see .
what didn &apos;t craig want his parents to see , will ?
was it this ?
you may want to put that with the other things .
please , you can &apos;t tell them .
i &apos;ve scoured the victims &apos; social feeds , and i can confirm
michelle is the only one
who turned up wearing a watch that didn &apos;t belong to her .
well , she &apos;s also the only one not wearing a watch when abducted .
time is somehow important to this unsub .
but not the right time . none of the watches were accurate .
that has to mean something .
well , it &apos;s a message , but for whom ?
the watch he put on michelle was broken .
could that be his way of saying her time was up ?
maybe they were taunts , telling us that we &apos;re out of time .
could it be like time of death ?
you know , like only the unsub understands it
notification kind of thing ?
you know , garcia might be right .
it happens .
not about the notifications . the times don &apos;t add up .
but what if it &apos;s a warning ? what if he &apos;s setting the watches
to the time of the next abduction ?
6 : 22 .
i really hope you &apos;re wrong , spence .
listen , i will take a shot if you &apos;ll ride the bull .
i &apos;ll ride the bull . i &apos;ll ride the bull . let &apos;s go .
3 , 2 , 1 .
oh , come on . that was disgusting .
what is that ?
oh , come on , don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;ve reached the shot stage already ?
you &apos;re late . where you been ?
and you brought a stray . who &apos;s your friend , mitch ?
this is doug . he just transferred in from the boston office ,
and he is in desperate need of friends and beverages .
and not necessarily in that order .
ah , you came to the right place . sit down .
have a drink .
yeah , you come sit by me , doug .
after you .
you &apos;re stuck with me , i guess .
you &apos;re stuck with me , pal .
how &apos;s it going ? i &apos;m paige .
doug . nice to meet you .
i &apos;m paul . hi .
you mind ?
not if you share . then we &apos;re cool .
thank you .
how was work ?
i need a drink .
oh . here . have at it .
thank you so much .
so ... what kind of trouble are we getting into tonight ?
oh , you like trouble .
who doesn &apos;t ?
michelle was a smoker .
if the unsub saw her on his own ,
he could have asked to bum a cigarette or offered her a light .
it &apos;s an easy in .
yeah . but according to the m.e. &apos; s report ,
neither heather nor craig were smokers .
they don &apos;t need to be . this guy &apos;s socially proficient .
he can adapt his ruse to whomever he targets .
well , does that include sexual orientation ?
craig pickett was at a gay bar
the night he went missing .
well , that fits with the other abductions .
but why would the roommate lie ?
craig hadn &apos;t come out to his parents .
will was trying to protect his friend &apos;s secret .
or intentionally obstructing the investigation .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
because of the physical brutality he suffered ,
will assumed craig was the victim of a hate crime
and didn &apos;t want his death becoming a media spectacle .
so we &apos;re back to square one .
not necessarily .
craig was the only victim that the unsub felt remorse for .
their connection could have been an intimate one .
you know , i gotta say ...
that was one hell of a welcome to austin .
i guess we got a little carried away .
need some help ?
got it .
ok .
you all right ?
paul ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
we shouldn &apos;t have done that .
i thought you were into it .
i wasn &apos;t .
i was . just i ...
you should go .
no , not until you talk to me .
here . have a seat .
what is going through your head right now ?
guys are not sup--
guys are supposed to be with girls .
oh , man .
someone really did a number on you , didn &apos;t they ?
parent or pastor ?
how do you do this ? i mean , how are you ok with this ?
i wasn &apos;t . not for a real long time .
but there comes a point when you just gotta ask yourself
how much longer are you willing to pretend
to be someone that you aren &apos;t .
who says i &apos;m pretending ? who says i &apos;m ...
hey . this room , for one .
yeah , it is a mess .
yeah , it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
then i guess it &apos;s a good thing you met me , then .
i &apos;m a great teacher .
relax , baby .
i &apos;m a great teacher .
get out . just-- don &apos;t touch me .
paul , what the hell ?
don &apos;t ...
there &apos;s been another victim ?
doug warn .
an accountant from boston .
hotch and rossi are still at the crime scene .
body was dumped near a park .
was he wearing a watch ?
6 : 59 . was the watch still working ?
if you mean by working , still ticking , yeah ,
but it was at least 2.1 / 2 hours off , though .
now that we have a few working watches , though ,
we might be able to see a pattern
in how or why the unsub changes the times .
let &apos;s see .
6 ...
what time was the body discovered ?
i don &apos;t know . an hour ago , maybe . why ?
you know the exact time ?
a jogger called it in ...
at 9 : 04 . he was running laps ,
so the body couldn &apos;t have been laying there more than a few minutes .
i ...
think i know what the messages say .
well , reid , spit it out already .
6 : 22 .
ok , are you talking about michelle &apos;s watch or doug &apos;s watch ?
i &apos;m talking about all the watches .
if you take the times the bodies were discovered ,
subtract the variance the corresponding watches are off by ,
you land within plus or minus 6 minutes of 6 : 22
every single time . which , taking into consideration
the time between dump and discovery and all the public areas
and the fact that the only broken watch we found
was already stuck at 6 : 22,
it &apos;s reasonable to deduce
the unsub sets the watches to the exact same time
just before disposing of the bodies .
so stupid .
it was literally staring me in the face the whole time .
i don &apos;t know how i missed it .
come on , reid , stop .
you &apos;re the only person who can realize all of this .
so what does 6 : 22 mean ?
i have no idea .
reid ...
all i know is what it says . i don &apos;t know what it means .
well , he used a blunt object again .
this kill was just as impulsive as the first .
were there any defensive wounds under his clothes ?
no , but you should take a look .
that &apos;s combining murder rituals .
is he unraveling or evolving his m.o. ?
it could be both .
did he inflict the stab wounds pre- or postmortem ?
it was all postmortem after the first blow .
back of his head . killed him instantly .
next was the face ?
actually , no . based on the blood loss ,
i &apos;d say the stabbing was first .
that doesn &apos;t add up . why would he switch to a knife ,
then go back to the blunt object after ?
well , he must be attacking the face for a specific reason .
it could be a manifestation of his guilt ,
like the re @-@ dressing .
or of his self @-@ worth .
maybe he didn &apos;t want the men to see him .
his self @-@ esteem would have been at an all @-@ time low .
but he only reached the low with the men ,
not the women .
dr. aylesworth , did the victim have sex before he died ?
i believe so . i found traces of lubricant
consistent with that used on latex condoms .
thank you .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a white homosexual male
in his mid- to late 20s
who is suffering from an identity crisis .
this man can &apos;t accept his same @-@ sex desires ,
but he can &apos;t fight them either .
he &apos;s most likely been repressing all sexual urges for quite some time .
the first victim , craig pickett ,
represents a fall from the wagon , if you will .
intercourse between the two men
was most likely the unsub &apos;s trigger .
immediately after copulation ,
the male &apos;s serotonin levels drop .
the high is achieved during sex .
that rapid change can manifest itself in extreme depression
and low self @-@ esteem .
combined with an apparent belief
that acting on his attraction towards other men is wrong ,
this state causes the unsub to lash out violently at those he &apos;s with .
as his levels normalize ,
he begins to feel remorse for what he &apos;s done
and he tries to correct his course .
this is where heather and michelle come in .
after killing craig , the unsub sought out women
that he was desperate to be attracted to .
but he &apos;s trapped in a scenario with an impossible outcome .
he can &apos;t force himself to like women ,
so when he &apos;s unable to get aroused ,
he becomes depressed again and lashes out in anger
to the people he blames for his impotence .
the circular logic dictating his never @-@ ending cycle
was not formed overnight .
it most likely came about due to years of serious abuse ,
either emotional , physical , or both .
we &apos;re more than friends .
what are you talking about ?
i like him . like like him .
the hell you do . don &apos;t even think like that , son .
it &apos;s how i feel .
no , it isn &apos;t .
it can &apos;t be .
he &apos;s taken advantage of you somehow .
he hasn &apos;t . it &apos;s the truth .
truth ?
the truth ?
i &apos;ll show you the truth .
the most popular motive
for trying to overcome same @-@ sex attraction
is the need to be accepted by the parent or loved one
who has rejected the individual because of their homosexuality .
so focus on men who grew up in a broken home
and suffered under the guardianship of a domineering parent ,
as well as those who fell victim to bigotry or bullying .
tell her she &apos;s beautiful .
i am , aren &apos;t i ?
you &apos;re an abomination !
i &apos;m a great teacher .
you &apos;re doing it wrong .
i &apos;m gonna make you a real man .
an abomination !
the bottom line is this unsub will not stop killing .
with each failed attempt to become aroused by women
or to avoid giving in to his same @-@ sex urges ,
he becomes more desperate and more dangerous .
thank you .
oh , thank god you &apos;re ok .
you haven &apos;t been answering your phone all day
and i thought something had happened to you , too .
what are you talking about ?
doug was murdered last night .
what ?
yeah , it must have happened after you dropped him off .
he didn &apos;t show up to work and so i--
i went by his apartment and there were cops everywhere .
what &apos;d you tell them ?
nothing . i came straight here to make sure you were ok .
i &apos;m fine .
fine , i promise .
getting the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on a 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 is not easy .
i am looking up that date ,
and june 22 is quite eventful in recent history .
it sounds like miss thing &apos;s got something good .
well , uh , let &apos;s see .
on this date in 1990,
florida banned the wearing of thong bikinis .
i said good , baby girl .
right , right . ok .
let &apos;s see . june 22 , 1992,
supreme court ruled minnesota hate @-@ crime laws
violated free speech .
the defendant burned a cross
on the front yard of an african @-@ american family &apos;s house
who lived next door .
nothing in the unsub &apos;s profile suggests racial motivation , though .
no , but the cross has me thinking .
many religions suggest
that following through on homosexual desires
invites condemnation .
what if the unsub is struggling with his faith ?
garcia ,
are there any 6 : 22 bible passages
that are relevant ?
yeah , i thought of that ,
but the most popular one is matthew 6 : 22
and it has to do with lights and eyes . i don &apos;t see how that fits .
all right , well , let &apos;s look at this another way .
what are the passages that specifically relate to homosexuality ?
that &apos;s it . he &apos;s not saying 6 : 22 .
he &apos;s saying 18 : 22 .
as in leviticus 18 : 22 .
&quot; thou shalt not lie with mankind
as with womankind ,
for it is an abomination . &quot;
he converted 18 : 22 to 6 : 22 p.m ..
like military time .
maybe the unsub suffered abuse at the hands of someone
citing god &apos;s will that he should change .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time someone took the good book
and twisted it for their own agenda .
ok , but if you wanted to change someone &apos;s sexual orientation ,
how could you do it ? i mean ,
you &apos;re not gonna guilt somebody into that .
uh , i &apos;m seeing some stuff about an ex @-@ gay movement .
it looks like some kind of a 12 @-@ step program .
a 12 @-@ step program
usually doesn &apos;t traumatize the participant .
but conversion therapy might .
several conversion camps have been shut down recently
&apos;cause their methods border on torture .
yeah , but why would any faith condone the torture of children ?
none of them would . even a religion that frowns on homosexuality .
none of them would cross that line .
garcia , are there conversion camps in the area ?
i got a hit . camp willing
operates just outside of austin .
their motto is , &quot; it &apos;s time to change . &quot;
and guess which biblical passage is on their home page .
mitch .
what are you doing in here ?
i had to use the bathroom .
is this doug &apos;s blood ?
it &apos;s not my fault .
not your fault . whose fault was it , paul ?
theirs .
theirs ?
yeah .
how could it be their fault ?
they haven &apos;t laid a hand on you in years .
you know what they did to me ?
of course i do . they did the same thing to me , too .
there we go . no forgetting what time it is now .
best hurry off . you don &apos;t want to be late for class , do you ?
i can &apos;t let you leave yet , mitch .
we have to work some things out first .
our main purpose is to promote positive changes
for the conflicted individuals who come here .
there doesn &apos;t seem to be much room for self @-@ expression .
we try to keep things as uniform as possible .
we &apos;re not trying to stifle them .
it &apos;s just that progressive behavior in many ways
can unravel their recovery efforts .
such as colors ?
earth tones like brown or tan are the go @-@ to .
navy blue if the color doesn &apos;t fade or become too bright .
because bright blue would be considered too feminine ?
exactly .
and the auto shop aids in conversion how ?
we &apos;ve found that immersing the boys
in traditional male gender roles
stimulates an appreciation of their own masculinity .
i know it seems extreme ,
but you have to remember ,
our participants are in a fragile state of mind .
they come here confused , looking for answers .
we show them that the path to redemption
doesn &apos;t need to be walked alone .
you sound like you speak from experience .
i &apos;m a graduate .
the camp taught me to reject societal influences
that were steering me in the wrong direction .
and now i try to pass that knowledge on .
come .
when a new participant arrives ,
we have to evaluate their personal property
before it can be returned to them .
items like musical soundtracks or diaries are destroyed .
long hair is cut , dyed hair shaved , no earrings .
that sort of thing .
the watch is standard issue ?
cell phones aren &apos;t permitted .
the watches are so that
no one will be late to any of their lessons .
structure and timeliness become an important part of promoting change .
and what if someone breaks the rules ?
it &apos;s uncommon .
uncommon but not unheard of .
oh , occasionally a student will act out
or reject certain elements of the program .
what happens to those who act out ?
advanced therapy under supervision of a senior counselor .
could you be more specific ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t .
parents and staff sign confidentiality agreements
to protect the parents &apos; right to privacy .
and what about the children &apos;s rights ?
was there anything else i can help you with , agents ?
yes . we &apos;d like a list of program participants
dating back the past 15 years .
all we want are names .
that &apos;s quite impossible .
those records are confidential .
well , let &apos;s make them unconfidential .
or we &apos;ll be back here with a court order .
whoa , that &apos;s a lot of names .
cross the list with know associates
of each victim and see if you get a hit .
and , garcia , flag the participants who didn &apos;t finish the program .
they &apos;re most likely the ones
who had to endure this so @-@ called advanced therapy .
with x &apos;s and o &apos;s i go .
thank you .
you should have seen it .
all sense of individuality was stripped away .
and these kids were young .
you &apos;re sure it was the same watch ?
the unsub went to that camp .
the watch he put on michelle &apos;s wrist
was the exact same model that all the kids were wearing .
what do you think was behind that padlocked door ?
well , it could be anything .
i mean , come on , we &apos;ve all read the stories .
a conversion camp was just shut down last year
for using electric shock therapy on children .
another stripped the kids naked
and screamed profanities at them .
we need to go back with a warrant .
we &apos;re gonna need probable cause .
well , let &apos;s find some .
because there is more going on at that camp than they let on .
you gotta turn yourself in , paul .
i can &apos;t turn myself in . they &apos;re gonna put me away .
what , are you gonna kill me , too ?
no .
are you gonna turn me in ?
no .
no , paul .
y @-@ you just need some help .
i &apos;ve already had help . you remember that ?
no , i mean like real help , professional help .
it worked for me .
did it ?
yeah . me and josh are coming up on like 6 months now .
yeah .
it might throw a wrench in your happy union ...
you hanging out with a serial murderer and all .
oh , my god .
those women .
the ones who were stabbed .
that was you , wasn &apos;t it , paul ?
they reminded me of her .
what you got , mama ?
a man named mitchell ruiz
went to camp willing in 2003 .
he works at the same office as our dearly departed doug warn .
what &apos;s the catch ?
well , mitchell &apos;s office just reported him missing .
he went to go look for doug , he never returned .
so mitchell either is our unsub or he fell victim to him .
i did a little research to see
if he was one of th good kids or the bad kids .
it turns out that mitchell &apos;s parents ,
3 weeks into that conversion camp ,
they started making private payments to a dummy corp
that was shut down two years ago for prosecution ,
as in one prostitute , isabella grant .
and from the amount of money they were paying her ,
you have to wonder
what morals she wasn &apos;t willing to chew up and swallow .
miss grant , my name &apos;s aaron hotchner .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about camp willing .
what are you offering ?
you don &apos;t seem surprised .
it was a matter of time .
and you &apos;ve already got me in here
for everything else .
so what are you gonna give me if i talk ?
i don &apos;t make deals with child molesters .
i didn &apos;t molest anyone .
i was hired to help those kids .
being paid to prey on your victims doesn &apos;t change anything .
i had parental consent .
is that what the camp told you
to make you feel better ?
they didn &apos;t have to .
why ? because you didn &apos;t care ?
or because you &apos;d spoken to the parents directly ?
you show absolutely no remorse for what you &apos;ve done .
why should you ?
the smaller the victim , the easier to control .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about for you , isn &apos;t it ? control .
it &apos;s why you &apos;re showing me all this false confidence .
i &apos;m done talking .
you &apos;ve said plenty .
a professional like yourself
wouldn &apos;t trust the camp to protect you .
you had to get some sort of
insurance directly from the parents , didn &apos;t you ?
make sure that they were just as culpable for the crime .
your word against theirs wouldn &apos;t hold up in court ,
not with a child testifying to your abuse .
unless , of course , the abuse damned the parents as well .
they were in the room with you , weren &apos;t they ?
you made them watch .
where are you going ? what about my deal ?
we never had a deal .
why didn &apos;t it work ?
why didn &apos;t what work ?
with the girls . why couldn &apos;t i just--
why couldn &apos;t i just do it ?
you killed them . what more did you want to do ?
not that .
it .
i could always get it up for her .
well , then we were teenagers .
we could practically get it up for tomato soup .
you ever wonder why we broke up ?
you ever wonder that ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that year of hell had something to do with it .
yeah , a year .
you were lucky .
i screwed up , mitch . i--
i thought that maybe those girls could fix me .
paul , listen to me .
you don &apos;t need fixing .
you just need a little bit of help .
now , please , man , just give me the gun .
you know that this isn &apos;t the way .
relax . you got it .
you &apos;re so beautiful .
damn it , paul .
that &apos;s not the way .
come here .
let me show you .
you know what ? you &apos;re right ?
i &apos;m not the one that needs fixing .
garcia , i need you to track who was at the conversion camp
the same time as mitchell ruiz ,
and then narrow that to those whose parents made payments
to isabella grant &apos;s dummy corporation .
uh ... only one name matches . paul westin .
he went to the same school as mitchell ,
and his mom was killed in action in iraq
when he was only a &apos; tween .
all right , find out everything you can about paul
and then send the address to jj and blake .
yep . sending it now .
clear .
clear .
clear . jj ?
paul ?
get in the house right now .
what &apos;s going on ? are you in trouble , son ?
don &apos;t you call me that !
you don &apos;t get to call me that !
not after what you did to me .
paul , please .
what did i do ?
what did you do ? the camp ? you remember , huh ?
you remember that ?
get your ass downstairs !
let &apos;s talk about this , son .
there &apos;s nothing to talk about !
paul !
what the hell ? you gonna kill your dad ?
i was trying to save you .
save me ? ha .
you mean fix me , don &apos;t you ?
fix me . all those years trying to prove to me that i was broken .
well , it worked , dad .
it worked . i &apos;m pretty damn broken now .
that &apos;s not what i wanted .
what you wanted .
take his clothes off .
what ?
take his clothes off .
what for ?
well , they all thought that they could rape us straight .
i think it &apos;s time we see if it works the other way around .
we have to assume mitchell is with him .
the keys and wallet are in the living room .
could he be working with paul ?
everything points to paul working alone ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that mitchell isn &apos;t sympathetic to the cause .
he experienced the same trauma .
i think i know why .
they were in a relationship .
they were abused for loving one another .
where would they go ?
with mitchell helping him , they &apos;d be focused on revenge .
isabella &apos;s in prison , so he wouldn &apos;t have a lot of options .
you two head to the camp and
i &apos;ll send the others to the father &apos;s house .
get to it already .
i can &apos;t .
i want to go home , paul , please .
he &apos;s the one that got us into that camp .
convinced your parents to let that woman do this to us .
do you want to make him pay ?
of course i do , but not like this .
mitchell , i &apos;d do it if i could .
but i can &apos;t . it &apos;s gotta be you .
and then what ? it &apos;s not gonna solve anything .
i &apos;m not looking for solutions .
i &apos;m just looking to cope . right , dad ?
this isn &apos;t coping .
this is crazy .
you &apos;re starting to sound like one of them .
only one of us is suggesting rape .
it &apos;s paul &apos;s truck .
paul ?
mitch ? mitch .
son !
hey , you &apos;re ok . come here .
come here . now you &apos;re all right .
mitch .
don &apos;t you--don &apos;t you die on me .
don &apos;t do it !
don &apos;t do it , paul .
there &apos;s nothing left for me here .
look at his wrist . track marks .
what happened to you in that camp , paul ?
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
yes , it does .
you kill yourself , they get away with it .
if you testify , we can shut them down for good .
what good ? i &apos;m an abomination .
no , you &apos;re not .
if you want to live your life
according to a single message , go ahead .
but try john 13 : 34 instead .
&quot; a new command i give you .
love one another .
as i have loved you ,
you must love one another . &quot;
the best way for you to do that is to put that gun down .
paul , you are a victim .
and there are others being
victimized right now that you can help .
wouldn &apos;t mitchell want you to do everything possible
to make sure that nobody else suffered your same fate ?
come on .
put it down .
who can tell me the first stage ? anton .
pidgin .
pidgin is correct , mr. slavsky .
pidgin .
this is when non @-@ native speakers
use phrases from the mainstream language
in a broken manner ,
usually resulting in a overly literal translation .
broken
