第一季 第十二集
daddy .
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy .
amanda .
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died ,
he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
i &apos;d like to introduce you to amanda clarke .
what brings you to town ?
i just came for a visit ,
but i &apos;m thinking of making it more permanent .
jack &apos;s a real keeper .
you should try to hold on to that one .
that &apos;s the plan .
you &apos;ve had a target on my head since the day we met .
for the average person leading an ordinary life ,
fame holds an hypnotic attraction .
many would sooner perish than exist in anonymity .
but for the unlucky few
who &apos;ve had notoriety forced upon them ,
infamy can be a sentence
more damning than any prison term .
good book ?
riveting .
another late night at the empire ?
i share a last name with the c.e.o.
you &apos;d think i &apos;d have less to prove , not more .
i &apos;m sure your dad &apos;s happy to see you taking it so seriously .
well , he &apos;d better be .
i &apos;ve decided to put business school on hold
and stay with the company .
wow . that &apos;s big news .
yeah .
good news ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s my mother .
i mean , she &apos;s ...
been pretty rattled about what happened with tyler .
and she &apos;s all alone up at the house
and was hoping maybe i &apos;d move back in for the summer .
well , it &apos;s ...
not like we wouldn &apos;t still see each other .
you think i should do it ?
i ...
think she &apos;s your mother .
when the season &apos;s over , i was thinking ,
maybe you and i could get a place in the city .
i mean , we &apos;ve already been kind of living together .
which has been wonderful .
but i never really imagined that i would
get a place
with somebody until i was married .
my parents were actually ...
pretty traditional .
and keeping those traditions alive , i--
i feel like i &apos;m honoring them in a small way .
yeah . i get it .
but don &apos;t get me wrong . i love you ,
and i want to be with you ,
just in the right way .
of course , one doesn &apos;t often consider
the role of inspiration in the work of nonfiction writing .
in my admittedly biased opinion , that is an oversight .
it is very much a factor of my work .
only it comes from without ,
not from within--
from the deceits perpetrated by the worst among us .
my subjects are always my inspiration .
what a tool .
mm . exactly .
oh ... mason .
thank you .
so well done .
thank you so much , and thank you for coming .
victoria .
i didn &apos;t know you knew mason treadwell .
oh , we &apos;re thick as thieves . and who might you be ?
mason , this is my neighbor-- emily thorne .
i own the house that david clarke was arrested in .
you don &apos;t say ?
it &apos;s an incredible story .
really amazing book . i @-@ impeccably researched .
would you mind ?
sure . thank you .
you know , if you aren &apos;t already on the list ,
victoria kindly offered her home for a reading
of my unpublished memoirs this weekend .
you should drop in .
i would love to .
may i introduce you to my friend--nolan ross ?
friend that needs no introduction--
&quot; wired &quot; magazine &apos;s man of the decade ,
number seven on &quot; forbes &apos; &quot; youngest billionaires .
well , six , actually , but who &apos;s counting ?
nolan , what brings you here ?
as a result of recent events ,
it occurred to me that i could die at any time .
yes , i heard that little deviant tyler
left you bound and gagged .
oh , it &apos;d be a shame if
i left this mortal coil
without anyone knowing the real me .
sounds like you &apos;re in the market for biographer .
not just any biographer .
why don &apos;t you stop by the cottage ,
and we &apos;ll discuss the possibilities ?
oh , charming .
quite a turnout .
thank you .
ta @-@ ta . okay . they &apos;re lovely .
mason , could you come to the house for lunch ?
there &apos;s something i &apos;d like to discuss with you .
how could i refuse ?
thank you .
stowaway .
jack , it &apos;s emily .
emily .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good , thanks to you and daniel .
i just wanted to call and say thanks again for intervening .
what you guys did was really brave .
well , at the end of the day ,
there were no bullets in the gun , so ...
no big deal .
how &apos;s amanda ?
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s okay .
yeah . she , uh ...
it was a little weird ,
all that stuff tyler said about her dad ,
but she &apos;ll be-- she &apos;ll be fine .
i gotta go .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
bye , jack . bye .
where &apos;s little brother ?
i let him go .
field trip with his girlfriend .
prep school registration .
we need a field trip .
what about atlantic city ?
a little gambling , a little clubbing ,
a little trouble .
mm . sounds great .
unfortunately , i &apos;ve got a bar to run .
snoozefest .
don &apos;t you get tired of doing the same thing every night ,
seeing the same people , listening to the same music ?
comes with the territory .
come on . be impulsive .
unplan your life .
amanda ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t .
i wonder if you &apos;d say no to emily thorne .
i &apos;ve always been amazed at how you can make 20,000 square feet
feel warm and inviting .
still , wiout conrad , it feels somehow empty .
now rumor has it , he &apos;s moved in to the southfork .
and good riddance .
this is one village that won &apos;t miss its idiot .
besides , i didn &apos;t bring you here for conrad .
i brought you here for amanda clarke .
amanda clarke ?
yes .
she &apos;s returned to town , and i want you to find out why .
how am i supposed to do that ?
you interviewed her after the trial .
tell her you &apos;d like to talk to her about your memoirs
as a way of reflecting on the past .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m comfortable with that .
then get comfortable with it .
you &apos;d still be covering earnings reports
in the back pages of the &quot; journal &quot; if it weren &apos;t for me .
don &apos;t forget it .
trust me , one doesn &apos;t easily forget
a deal he &apos;s made with the devil .
fine . i &apos;ll talk to her .
i &apos;m sure the girl is just here to get some closure .
the question is how far she will go to get it .
by the time the trial ended ,
every person i once trusted
had turned their back on me .
the only remaining option was to find an impartial observer
to tell my story .
i thought mason treadwell would be that person . &quot;
you have to understand the scope of the cover @-@ up .
we &apos;re talking about people on every level--
prosecutors , defense attorneys , friends ,
coworkers .
well , setting aside the logistics of your theory ,
why do you think all these people from your everyday life
would turn on you so rampantly ?
just promises of power , money ,
political favors .
i mean , you name it .
and then when i think those didn &apos;t work ,
they used threats .
think about it .
if they could put me in here ,
imagine what else they &apos;re capable of .
fascinating footage .
he &apos;s telling the truth .
in his twisted mind , he is .
the general consensus within the psychiatric community
is advanced pathological narcissism .
then no element of his story has been borne out by facts ?
not a shred .
the stowaway tavern . how fitting .
could i trouble you for a light ?
sorry .
there &apos;s no smoking inside .
come now .
there are no patrons inside . who would possibly object ?
oh . it &apos;s after 11 : 00 . why not ?
i &apos;ll have a gibson .
a gibson ?
are you for real ?
oh , yes .
you don &apos;t remember me , do you ... amanda ?
should i ?
i wouldn &apos;t have recognized you either .
it &apos;s been a long time .
mason treadwell .
i interviewed you when you were a little girl .
a couple of times , actually .
it was for my book about your father--
&quot; the society connection . &quot;
right . mason .
i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s a lot i don &apos;t remember about that time in my life .
oh , of course .
so , what brings you here ?
i could ask you the same question .
actually , i was hoping that you and i
could sit down and talk about that .
i &apos;m , uh , finishing up my memoirs ,
and i would love to include a ...
reprise chapter of sorts about you .
tomorrow ?
at my house ?
well , you &apos;ll be happy to hear that your prenup
is well on its way to being nullified due to duress .
thank you , ryan , for going above and beyond on that one .
where do we stand with charlotte ?
well , at this time , there &apos;s no compelling legal argument
to force her back home with you .
but believe me , i &apos;ll continue to dig .
right now my main concern is your interest in grayson global .
it seems conrad is seeking
to divest you of your stock in the company .
is he insane ?
someone needs to remind that man
that i earned every single one of those shares .
and without me , he wouldn &apos;t have
he &apos;s not insane .
he &apos;s strong @-@ arming .
but before we go into the ring with them on this ,
i think it &apos;d be wise if we set up a little insurance policy .
we need conrad to restore
daniel &apos;s access to his grandfather &apos;s trust .
you &apos;re asking me to involve my son in this ?
well , by his own declaration , he &apos;s already involved .
and he &apos;s on your side .
combine daniel &apos;s shares with yours ...
and we control the company .
right .
unfortunately , we can &apos;t simply ask conrad
to release daniel &apos;s stake in the firm to him .
he &apos;d put together the pieces immediately .
but we &apos;re not going to ask . daniel is .
then it becomes a simple question of loyalty--
conrad &apos;s to daniel ,
and daniel &apos;s to you .
what do you think of the campus ?
big . expensive .
it seems more like a college than a prep school .
kind of is .
my schedule is gonna be brutal--
calculus ,
a.p. physics , a.p. french--
i thought i tested out of french--
debate , tennis .
and i have to read &quot; paradise lost &quot;
before literary society in two weeks .
yeah , well , you weren &apos;t kidding , were you ?
about what ?
well , you know , after the summer ,
i &apos;m never gonna see you again .
i was exaggerating .
i &apos;ll have time off for thanksgiving ...
unless i go to geneva with the model u.n. team .
great .
i &apos;ll see you at christmas .
don &apos;t be like this , declan .
believe it or not , i can be quite the multitasker .
i believe you .
i &apos;m just not sure how i feel about being one of your tasks .
expecting someone , a date ?
no . lawyer . she &apos;s late .
all right . well , i &apos;ll make this quick .
now that i &apos;m leaving business school
and committing myself to the company ,
i think it &apos;s only fair that you release my trust .
mom &apos;s agreed to sign off on it ,
but obviously , i need you to as well .
renegotiating the terms of your employ already ?
that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s the grayson way .
well , consider it a show of faith .
i &apos;m ready to take my seat at the table .
well , all right , then .
i &apos;ll have the lawyers get into it .
am i interrupting ?
oh , no . no , i was just leaving .
thanks , dad .
yes , sir .
so daniel says that
he wants to follow in his old man &apos;s footsteps
on the condition that i reactivate his trust .
his mother has already agreed to it .
curious timing ,
since our request to reclaim her shares just went out this morning .
you did say she has a powerful influence over him .
yeah , and if i refuse him outright ,
she has everything she needs
to turn my son against me entirely .
so let &apos;s give him access to the trust &apos;s savings account .
but as far as the shares are in grayson global ,
let &apos;s stipulate they not be valid
until he marries or turns 30 .
are you sure about the marriage clause ?
from what you told me ,
he &apos;s getting pretty serious with your young neighbor .
my son is easily distracted .
it &apos;s a family trait .
i &apos;d be surprised if that relationship lasts the summer .
this cottage belonged to hemingway for a time .
he wrote &quot; the dangerous summer &quot; here .
it seems that celebrity haunts both our homes .
mm . very different ghosts , though .
and this is , as they say ,
where the magic happens .
all my tomes begin here ,
on a 1920s underwood 5,
once owned by john cheever , i &apos;m told .
and on those rare occasions
that i can &apos;t come up with a word ,
i simply just get out of my chair , and i go and look it up .
like the cavemen .
quite the collection .
all first editions ?
i pride myself on rare items .
to wit , my sole ...
working print of my memoirs .
no copies ?
no , not until the work is complete .
i find that duplication
somehow compromises the soul of the prose .
yeah .
my subject recordings .
you noted the research that went into &quot; society , &quot;
well , there it all is--
hundreds of hours of one @-@ on @-@ one interviews
with the key players .
as a fan , you might be interested to know
that i &apos;ll be reinterviewing
david clarke &apos;s daughter for my memoirs .
amanda clarke ?
how fascinating .
what do you call that ?
being awesome .
i totally want to kiss you right now .
not while my boyfriend &apos;s watching .
hey , uh , maybe tone it down a little bit .
just keeping the customers happy .
i know , but there &apos;s a line .
this isn &apos;t like other places you &apos;ve worked .
whatever you say , boss .
all right , bargain shoppers .
it &apos;s time for the blue light special .
$ 1 shots . put your cash on the bar
and open your pretty little mouths .
where &apos;s my beer ?
amanda &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t she ?
mm @-@ hmm .
crowd seems happy .
yeah .
any happier , the city might have to shut us down .
we just killed the pilsner .
okay , just give me a second .
i &apos;m sorry . um ...
can i get you two a table or ...
maybe a room ?
actually , i came to talk to you , amanda .
do you have a second ?
i &apos;ll go switch out that keg .
level with me--
is there something going on between you and jack ?
what ? no . jack and i are just friends .
you know that .
i &apos;m not sure he believes that .
are you kidding me ? he &apos;s head over heels for you .
all he talks about is how happy you make him .
so what did you want to talk about ?
outside ?
i could use some fresh air and another drink .
no , i &apos;m good , but you go ahead .
come on . what happened to the girl
who used to stockpile pudding cups
so she could bribe sergeant cankles
for a bottle of tequila ?
she &apos;s still here , believe me .
really ?
to the girls of cell block &quot; d. &quot;
how come you didn &apos;t tell me
that mason treadwell tracked you down
and tried to sweet talk you into an interview ?
that &apos;s not exactly how it happened ,
but so what ?
you trusted me to be you for ten years .
what &apos;s so different about this guy ?
treadwell &apos;s a bottom @-@ feeder
who made millions off of lies that he wrote about my father .
what are you talking about ?
i thought your father was a cold @-@ blooded killer .
so did i ,
because of what was written in that book .
are you telling me , your father wasn &apos;t guilty ?
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s more to the story .
but i can &apos;t prove it unless you help me .
what do you want me to do ?
so how was your visit
to the land of entitled teenagers ?
oh , awesome ,
and maybe the last time i &apos;ll see my girlfriend ,
but speaking of girlfriends ,
looks like amanda was in rare form last night .
oh , god . you heard about that ?
oh , i did more than hear about it .
my phone &apos;s been blowing up all day ,
and this is my personal favorite shot ...
right here .
i am in way over my head with this girl .
no . no , no , no .
you need someone who &apos;s gonna force you to loosen up .
she &apos;s a forcer .
she &apos;s definitely a forcer .
listen to me for once , okay ?
you &apos;re too tightly wound for a guy your age .
you keep going like this , you &apos;re gonna end up like dad .
did i mention that i &apos;ve never done this before ?
it helps if you keep at least one eye open .
why &apos;d you bring him here again ?
he &apos;s dangerous .
he was pretty traumatized after the whole tyler thing--
being held hostage in his own home .
i thought this would make him feel safe again .
oh , somebody loves their second amendment .
dad and i spent a lot of time here when i was younger .
good times .
beat that .
best of three ?
ah , i can &apos;t , baby .
my dad set up a meeting with a prospective investor .
wanna come by after ?
uh , actually ,
i have somhing i need to take care of .
all right . uh , well , i &apos;ll see you when i see you .
bye , dan .
nolan .
first you &apos;re evicting the guy ,
and now you &apos;re blowing him off ?
well , you know what they say--
absence makes the heart grow fonder .
and i wasn &apos;t lying .
i do have plans . so do you .
really ?
mason &apos;s interviewing amanda .
i want to make sure we control the story .
control plus amanda equals a recipe for disaster .
why do you want to involve her ?
i thought this retribution had to do
with what treadwell wrote about your father .
clearly there &apos;s more to the story .
inquiring minds want to know .
treadwell started out as a reporter
covering the downing of flight 197,
only back then , he didn &apos;t go by mason .
his real name was ...
leo treadwell .
i &apos;m a journalist .
how do you like it here , amanda ?
i &apos;m told that your prior foster home was destroyed by a fire .
how terrible .
sometimes bad things happen to good people .
indeed .
i &apos;m here because your father says he &apos;s innocent ,
that he didn &apos;t do what they &apos;re saying .
but they proved it in court .
courts have been known to make mistakes .
do you think they made a mistake , amanda ?
i have to say he &apos;s guilty ...
or they &apos;ll put me away ,
just like him .
i am not gonna let that happen .
i keep this here where they can &apos;t find it .
i don &apos;t think he did it .
i don &apos;t either .
how &apos;d you like to help me rescue your father ?
but the book he published might as well have been written by the graysons--
all the same lies .
what &apos;s worse
is he made me believe them .
so how do you make the punishment fit this particular crime ?
the c.e.o. is a client .
daniel , welcome .
sofie arnault ,
meet my secret weapon--daniel .
nice to meet you .
sofie &apos;s grandfather is farris arnault--
of arnault offshore .
the one and only .
and i &apos;m afraid ...
i have another meeting to get to ,
so i &apos;ll leave you in the very capable hands of my son .
i think i know why you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re heavily invested in your family business ,
which is admirable ,
but when the euro &apos;s in a tailspin ,
loyalty doesn &apos;t pay dividends .
you want to diversify .
i &apos;m thinking china .
oh , everybody &apos;s thinking china .
we need to get you ahead of the curve .
i like the sound of that .
but i must be very careful
about who i choose to get into bed with .
well , like my father said , you &apos;ll be in good hands .
i like the sound of that even more .
hey , you in there ?
you don &apos;t mind if i record this , do you ?
no .
so i see you &apos;re still a clarke .
why keep your father &apos;s last name ?
i didn &apos;t see much point in hiding who i was .
you didn &apos;t mind being the daughter
of a @-@ a man who financed terrorism ?
in some ways , it helped me .
it showed me who my true friends were .
and now here you are , back at the scene of the crime ,
nearly two decades later .
i would think that the memories are quite painful .
some .
but i &apos;ve come back on my terms .
i won &apos;t let the past have power over me ...
not anymore .
well , still ...
some people perceive you as a victim of the scandal ,
one who might be carrying a grudge .
i &apos;m just trying to be ... a good person
and live a good life .
lately , i even started thinking about putting down roots .
i may even start a family .
look out , captain jack .
this little birdie &apos;s in search of nest .
amanda , stay focused .
it &apos;s our turn to ask the questions .
when you came to see me after my father &apos;s trial ,
you told me to trust you , and i did .
i told you the truth ...
that i had seen my father and victoria grayson together ,
romantically ,
that there was another man there that night on the porch .
she &apos;s good .
you were a child .
your mental state was in question .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t possibly take your word for it .
no .
you chose to take hers .
and what about your word , leo ?
i don &apos;t think he did it .
i don &apos;t either .
how &apos;d you like to help me rescue your father ?
you didn &apos;t print a word of what i said to you .
all stories have competing truths .
i simply ...
settled on the most logical .
and you were paid handsomely for that endorsement , i &apos;m sure .
amanda , you &apos;re confused .
you don &apos;t have all the facts .
here are the facts-- you and i both know you &apos;re a fraud .
one way or another , the truth will come out .
stand up , amanda . get in his face .
your reading at victoria &apos;s
is your last chance to redeem yourself .
i suggest you take it .
go , amanda .
check you out , cyrano .
you &apos;ve just teed leo up
to blow the lid off the whole conspiracy .
it would seem that way , wouldn &apos;t it ?
the rose couture or the herve leger ?
no more bandage dresses .
right . i &apos;ll have it burned immediately .
everybody decent ?
daniel , come in .
hey . darling .
ash , can you give us a minute ?
of course .
listen , dad threw us a curveball .
now what ?
he had me meet with this woman ,
supposedly a prospective investor ,
but i think he promised her
a lot more than financial advice .
he set you up on date ?
yeah . sofie arnault .
oh , well , i &apos;ll give him points for taste .
well , it made me suspicious ,
so i checked the fine print on my trust .
it turns out , he had the conditions amended .
i get access to the cash , but won &apos;t be fully vested in the company
until i turn 30
or get married ,
whichever comes first .
well , it was worth a try . thanks , darling .
the fight &apos;s not over , mom .
all i need is emily to say yes , and i collect those shares .
no , daniel .
mom , i love her ... so why wait ?
what do people wait for exactly , a sign ?
maybe this is it .
people wait for certainty .
did you have that with dad ?
no , and that &apos;s why i want it for you .
let &apos;s discuss this later .
i have guests coming and i have to get dressed .
i want to be with her , mom ,
and if it gives you the upper hand against dad ,
then what &apos;s the argument against it ?
ashley , are you out there ?
yes .
is emily coming to the reading ?
yeah , i think she just arrived .
good .
i need you to do something for me .
i don &apos;t see the guest of honor . do you ?
maybe he accidentally strangled himself
with an ascot .
emily , walk with me ?
sure .
is everything okay ?
mason didn &apos;t cancel on you , did he ?
no , he &apos;s just running late . this is about daniel .
did he tell you how
conrad altered the terms of his trust ?
no . why would he discuss that with me ?
more importantly , why would he discuss that with you ?
well , he didn &apos;t .
my ears just happened to be in the right place at the right time .
the amendment makes it so the only way
daniel can fully access his trust before he turns 30
is to get married .
why are you telling me this ?
because you &apos;re my friend .
if i were you , i would want to know whether or not
my boyfriend &apos;s motives were pure before he became my fiance .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been writing some new material for the reading .
well , you were supposed to call me
after you spoke with amanda clarke .
what did you find out ?
that she &apos;s a very angry girl with a sharp memory .
what exactly does she remember ?
the truth about your relationship with her father .
she wants to pull on that thread
till it unravels everything ,
and if that were to happen ...
i &apos;ll go down as one of the biggest frauds in literary history .
there are far worse fates .
i &apos;m here to get your side of the story , mrs. grayson .
do you have a response to david clarke &apos;s allegations
that you two were lovers ?
if you print a word of that garbage ,
i will sue you for slander .
he says you wrote him a note
on the eve of his conviction
promising to go to prosecutor kingsly
with information that would exonerate him .
clearly no such thing came to pass .
so you &apos;re denying the existence of that note ?
that &apos;s the end of the interview .
but it &apos;s only just begun .
david clarke &apos;s obviously using you
to try and sell his preposterous story
in a desperate attempt to launch some sort of appeal .
and that &apos;s something any reporter worth his salt
would recognize immediately .
we &apos;ll have no part of it .
as you wish .
but i &apos;m going to write this story
with or without your input .
feel free to sue me .
my only asset is an answering machine
brimming over with livid messages from my creditors .
you see , i have nothing to lose , mr. and mrs. grayson .
while you , it would appear , have plenty .
just a moment , mr. treadwell .
perhaps there is an arrangement that can be made after all .
the people i bring into my inner circle
will always be protected .
you will remain in that circle
as long as you hold up your agreement .
if you choose not to ,
i guarantee that those memoirs you &apos;re so proud of
will end in a very dark chapter .
&quot; it was nearly 15 years to the day
since the publication of my first book ,
the definitive work on david clarke &apos;s role
in the downing of flight 197,
that i found myself sitting across from
the daughter of that now infamous man .
i sat both rapt with wonder
and besieged by guilt as amanda recounted for me
the crushing disappointments of a life spent
running from the awesome shadow of her father &apos;s misdeeds .
at the time of her father &apos;s incarceration ,
she was just 9,
barely able to comprehend much less question
the charges leveled against her father .
but the amanda clarke that appeared before me now
was all grown @-@ up
and determined to question everything .
her misgivings were contagious
and forced me to take a long look back ,
to sift through every word i had written
in search of any mistakes that demanded correction .
could it be true ?
could i have been wrong about david clarke ?
the answer , i &apos;m afraid to say ...
was a resounding ...
no .
spineless , seer sucking dilettante .
you know , i haven &apos;t been this disappointed
since &quot; phantom menace &quot; ?
you didn &apos;t actually think he &apos;d come clean , did you ?
well , didn &apos;t you ?
no . victoria has too much power over him .
then ...
why go to the trouble of having amanda threaten him ?
i have my reasons .
spill .
you just need to take him to dinner .
tell him you want to hire him to write your biography
and take him somewhere out of the way .
i &apos;m gonna need time .
time for what ?
you &apos;ll know it when you see it .
so ... you have anywhere special in mind ?
oh , someplace cozy .
i prefer , uh , getting to know my subjects in intimate environments .
this should be fun .
we should &apos;ve seen a countermove like this coming .
conrad is many things ,
paranoid first among them .
the new conditions on daniel &apos;s trust
don &apos;t mean we have to change our strategy .
you said daniel broached the subject of marrying emily .
give him your blessing , take control of the company .
the company is far less important to me than my son .
you said this was going to be an insurance policy .
i &apos;m trying to protect your future .
and i &apos;m protecting my son &apos;s .
i will not have him rushing into a marriage
with a woman i don &apos;t even trust .
sounds like he &apos;s already made up his mind .
you stand in his way ,
you risk losing the alliance you &apos;ve built .
conrad only stipulated marriage ,
not a successful one .
your son wants to rush into this ,
let him .
somebody die ?
yeah .
yeah , old , uptight jack .
look ...
i &apos;m sorry about the other night .
you were just , uh ...
you were just trying to show everyone a good time ,
and i should &apos;ve rolled with it .
you &apos;re not repulsed by my behavior ?
no .
no , actually , i envy you .
you &apos;re-- you &apos;re spontaneous and fun .
and you got that gene that allows you to leap without looking .
i wish i was more like that .
you forgive me ?
depends .
what &apos;s with the bowl of cash ?
it &apos;s our tips from this week .
over 500 bucks .
thanks to the hottest bartender in montauk .
bull really packs the house .
darlin &apos; ...
find something sexy to wear ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna take you to atlantic city ,
and you &apos;re gonna watch me turn $ 500 into $ 5,000 .
serious ?
as a heart attack .
people are fond of saying that you can &apos;t unring a bell .
and while that may be true ...
you can certainly smother its ring
under the dull roar of conjecture and lies .
but some words ring out like church bells ,
rising above the din ,
calling us to the truth .
i know it &apos;s getting late ,
but you must come in for a nightcap .
oh , yes , i must .
i have 80 @-@ year @-@ old bottle of madeira
that we can use to toast our new endeavor .
what in god &apos;s name ...
no .
no .
no !
no .
no ! no !
no . no !
oh , my god .
oh , no .
no . no .
bad girl .
my manuscript is my work .
oh , my god . no .
hi .
hi .
suddenly my bed feels awfully empty and cold .
i was just thinking the same thing .
just so we &apos;re clear ...
i &apos;m still firm on the whole &quot; no living together &quot; thing .
so you &apos;re just coming to hook up and leave ?
that &apos;s the idea .
i &apos;m good with that .
some words are immortal .
long @-@ buried or even burned ,
they &apos;re destined to be reborn ,
like a phoenix rising from the ashes .
i &apos;m telling you , victoria and i were in love .
she was gonna leave conrad ,
and we were gonna become a family .
victoria &apos;s denying all of it .
okay . well , they must have gotten to her somehow .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything without proof .
what about the letter she wrote me ?
it was unsigned .
it could &apos;ve been sent by anybody .
and when they do ...
it can literally take your breath away .
six months ago ,
victoria gave birth to a baby girl .
her name is charlotte .
you want proof that i &apos;m telling the truth ?
