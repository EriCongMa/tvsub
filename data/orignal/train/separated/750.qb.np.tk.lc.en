oh , hey guys , you have any hair you want removed ?
hey .
i must respectfully decline such a horribly depressing invitation .
going on a date with elizabeth tonight .
i haven &apos;t had sex with her since i was fat and accessing my penis
was like getting the remote control out of the couch .

and i own things .
like this .

oh , my god , that poor girl .
this is the archduke .
the crowning achievement
of the german institute of female pleasure .

i thought i threw that thing out the window .
that only made it stronger .
oh , that reminds me :
daisy called , and we &apos;re going out tonight .
yeah , she sounded pretty excited .
i do believe her exact words were ,
&quot; this is your last chance . &quot;
so , i &apos;m very confident .

&apos;cause it is the worst .
no , no .
it &apos;s the worst ! it &apos;s the worst .
they ...
i guarantee you it &apos;s not any more embarrassing
than the story of me losing my virginity .
i promise you mine &apos;s worse than all of yours .
prom night . 2000 .
what was the theme ?
yeah , who cares about the theme ?
what were you wearing ?
i want to know the theme .
第二季 第二十三集
it was after prom . cece and i were both 18,
and we &apos;d rented a hotel room .
so ... would you like to freak ?
yes , i would .
so
and i thought what i felt was simple ...
i &apos;m gonna freak you toward the bed .
do i have your permission ?
yes , you do .
and now that i am leaving
now i know that i ...
so , he and i were the founding members
of the gender equality society .
also , the only members of the gender equality society .
we both asked each other to the prom
in the spirit of gender equality ,
and we both said yes .
okay , get to it .
no one cares .
oregon sucks .
i &apos;m gonna take off your dress .
do i have your permission ?
yup . yup . okay .
i only hear what i want to
i can &apos;t find the zipper .
oh , there is no zipper .
um , i made this dress ,
and my mom sewed me in , so ...
um , maybe i can try in the abdominal area here ?
is that okay ?
yes . you have my permission .
unwind the ...
maybe if , um ... you know ,
um , &apos; cause maybe you could just rip it .
i turn the radio up ...
i ... i just want to make sure you &apos;re feeling safe ...
no , no , no . i @-@ i feel , like , so safe ,
and , like , i &apos;ve never felt , like , more safe .
well , do i have your permission ...
just be a man and rip it off ...
when we weep for the other
who was dying since the day they were born
well , well ...
now i &apos;m feeling very unsafe .
but i &apos;m thrown
and i thought i &apos;d live forever ...
i think , um , i &apos;m gonna go ,
um , get ... like , i &apos;ll see if the front desk
has a seam ripper .
yeah .
come on , jess .
get to the sex part .
if this is another story
about sewing , i swear to god ...
please . i &apos;m getting there .
you okay ?
yeah .
oh , man .
he wore the hell out of those tuxedo pants .
people have told me i look really good in tuxedos , so ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen you in a tux .
i &apos;ve worn a tuxedo .
everybody has tuxedos .
tuxedo is different than a suit .
it is ?
wait , didn &apos;t he have a guitar ?
oh , my god , yes . best part .
and now that i am leaving
i know that i did something wrong
cause i missed you
yeah , yeah
cause i missed you .
lame .
man ...
prom is so stupid , right ?
yeah , and , like ,
what is &quot; prom &quot; short for ?
i think it &apos;s actually &quot; promenade . &quot;
so , you want a man ? you want a ... want a man ?
okay , there are no scissors in there ,
so i taped these two steak knives together .
now , do i have your permission to just ...
oh , my god .
uh , i have ...
to deal with this ...
so , you mean to tell me you didn &apos;t
lose your virginity at prom ?
technically , no .
technically ?
technically ,
why did we listen to that
whole story , then ?
technically , this guy &apos;s the worst .
playing guitar for girls .
girls don &apos;t like that . that &apos;s a fact .
it &apos;s okay , man .
what &apos;s okay ?
i wasn &apos;t done yet , guys .
i was in the prologue .
david foster wallace , where is the sex ?
you &apos;re in last place .
cece , please go . tell your story
of how your lost your virginity . i need a palate cleanse .
actually , it was the same night .
it was prom night ?
really ?
who was it with ?
study hall steve or cool car johnny ?
not them .
so what ? i &apos;m a virgin .
i don &apos;t want to plan it out .
whatever happens , happens .
oh , hello .
i &apos;d like to make love to you .
that &apos;s mick jagger .
what ? ! whoa !
game changer !
freaking ...
beatlemania ! beatlemania !
keep it together , schmidt .
oh , my ... the beatles ? !
he was just on tour in portland ,
and we just started talking ,
and then we started laughing ...
what ... but i &apos;m confused .
uh , cece , that is not an embarrassing story .
yeah , i know .
but i just love telling it .
yeah .
cece , you officially move into last place .
boom . moving up , worst story .
jess , you have no chance of winning .
it was my junior year of college .
i was about 200 pounds heavier .
freshman 50 plus sophomore 50
plus junior 100 .
i got some lubricant .
it &apos;s to use on a woman .
uh ... to increase her pleasure .
hey , is it chill that i have the room later ?
elizabeth and i have been talking , and ...
we plan on merging tonight .
yeah , schmidt !
penis , vagina . penis , vagina .
the room &apos;s all yours , cowboy .
yeah , i got some , uh , mushrooms ,
and i &apos;m going to a dave matthews concert later .
i &apos;ve a daver .
that sucks !
white people .
is this the first time you &apos;ll be making ... full love ?
no way , jose .
nick ... back in high school ,
they used to call me ...
the sex ... the sex hammer .
that &apos;s a great nickname.- but , you know ,
now that we &apos;re sitting here talking ,
would you mind having a discussion , uh , openly
about the subject of intercourse ?
shoot .
cool .
hey , does it hurt for the guys ?
not one bit .
if i pee while it &apos;s happening , will she die ?
how many minutes before sex is it ... is it okay to eat ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s an exact science .
i think it depends on your frame .
so , i should eat right before .
in terms of lubricant ,
do i put a small amount everywhere
or do i use a large amount in a small ...
in a smaller area ?
you &apos;re harshing my vibe , schmidt .
you &apos;re the coolest , nick .
you know , so i &apos;d already taken the mushrooms .
obviously .
and i was ready
to go to the concert ,
when i realized that
the troll at the end of my bed
was pretty upset about it .
i don &apos;t want any trouble .
i think you &apos;re a remarkable creature .
no .
oh ... i feel hot in my pants .
i still don &apos;t understand why you didn &apos;t just leave .
i &apos;ve told you a million times ,
my arm was a magnet
and the walls were magnetic .
what about that do you not understand ?
that &apos;s a real big jar of lube , man .
wait , why are you rubbing it on your leg ?
no , that &apos;s my arm .
aah ! eyes , eyes , eyes !
oh , stop moving so much . you &apos;re too slippery .
oh , this lube is so slippery .
schmidt , where are you ? i can &apos;t see .
sex .
i @-@ i think there &apos;s enough lube .
i think we can do it now .
you definitely shouldn &apos;t
be going to get more .
schmidt ?
be right there .
i think we overdid it .
i can &apos;t see !
i &apos;m right here ... no !
schmidt , i want to make love !
i got to go .
it &apos;s sex .
i &apos;m coming , elizabeth !
look , when we were dating ,
i was very limited as to what we could do sexually .
it wasn &apos;t until the iraqi war
that i realized a guy could even be on top .
but that &apos;s all different now .
now i have the archduke .
schmidt , have you ever considered not using lube
and some giant sex toy ,
and just being with her ?
plain jane @-@ ing it ? yeah , okay .
well , i know for a fact that i can &apos;t win this thing ,
because my story was ...
beautiful .
no , your story was not beautiful .
nick &apos;s dad took us on a business trip to new york , right ?
and he said that we could do whatever we wanted .
and we did .
oh , man .
they &apos;re all on the titanic .
how does this movie end ?
i can &apos;t believe i never seen it before , man .
it &apos;s the best .
you &apos;re mom &apos;s the best ...
at having boobs .
shut up , stupid .
i &apos;m just kidding , man .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t bring you two dummies all the way to new york
so you can park your cans on the couch , watch tv
and flick each other &apos;s bics .
hey , dad , last night , somebody broke in
and ordered a pornographic movie ,
so there &apos;s a mistake on the bill .
yeah , okay , you can tell that to the marines .
meanwhile ... i have a little surprise for you boys .
oh , cool .

for ten beautiful seconds .
so , what do you do for a living ?
and it was good .
nick , i can &apos;t believe yolost your virginity to octopussy .
i couldn &apos;t go through with it .
it &apos;s &apos; cause the boy had no game .
he couldn &apos;t close .
okay , you don &apos;t need game .
they were prostitutes . my dad told me .
pop @-@ pop told you ? when ?
nicky , you here ?
yeah , i &apos;m here , dad .

how do you think i got through annie ?
geez , that was rough .
what happened here ?
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
i couldn &apos;t make love to ms. octopussy tonight .
it &apos;s too dangerous ,
and i was afraid the fbi was gonna track me down
or a paper trail .
you think too much . you think too much about everything .
when i was your age ,
my dad got a girl for me , too .
i mean , this is almost a miller family tradition .
you should have seen her boobs .
they were great .
real pointy , just like i like &apos; em .
gross .
listen , nicky ,
you don &apos;t have to do anything that you don &apos;t want to do .
i just want to make sure
that you don &apos;t miss out on the things in life
that are happening when you &apos;re not thinking .
because , believe in me ,
those are the best things in life .
i think i really like drinking .
well , that &apos;s great . that &apos;s wonderful . that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s a great start .
it &apos;s really fun .
it makes me feel good .

yeah , i won &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want to break his heart , you know ?
okay .
i mean , you can tell him , but just ... wait , you know ?

so it &apos;s time you should know .
mysteria ...
on the bright side ,

actually ...
jess , look at him . let him have this .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , winston . i just can &apos;t let you win this .
my story ... involves ...

so , i &apos;d just moved to l.a. to be with cece
and we went out to some bar .
do you remember where that was ?

they &apos;ll know .
okay . what about those guys over there ?

uh , it &apos;s really a medical issue .
i &apos;m so sorry . that was really uncool .
and ... take as much time as you need .

i didn &apos;t have to think about it .
well , who wins ? i @-@ i need a winner .

jess , wait .
so , is he , like , the kind
of fireman that hangs back and takes care of the dog ?
